I think mortis is the same speed as el primo
---
Thanks

Easy he chucks it of his shoulder bouncing and going toward the target
---
Blur out yo own name but no one else‚Äôs 
---
Yeah, but I still can't use controllers on my notches, kind of making my screen smaller than my brothers screen, which isn't notched, same dimensions, except I have a notch and he doesn't, makes my screen smaller, kind of a little tweak but could make it a lot more comfortable

People say that leon is so strong and needs a nerf but without him then the throwers will dominate again.
---
that was literally me a few days ago
---
About $20 to do your job for you. Pass.

Are you seriously complaining about the prize? If you have a problem with the prize, don't enter into the competition!
---
Iign = ThomasGN. You‚Äôll see that my highest rated is Bull @~260. Mostly because I bumrush vault with him in heist and people are bad. I don‚Äôt really use him out of heist ever
---
Alright, I had just assumed you where f2p, you might be a lil unlucky. It just rlly annoys me when there are people less then 3k trophies complaining about legendaries, meanwhile there are 10k+ ppl like me who have either 1 or no legendaries. I guess I‚Äôm just tryna say there are ppl who have it way worse than you. 
---
ive played for about 2-3 hours now this evening and so far im at roughly 15 trophies gained total... this is my evening.. every evening lol.
---
Well. The new map for it says no. 
---
Birdman is that you?
---
Why would you be offended by the word royal?
---
You have a point. I think people overexaggerate how bad randoms are. I've had plenty of amazing random players who I've added and still play with all the time, even Kairos likes playing with randoms... Makes you a better player. Although I haven't been playing for too long, I've climbed to 7.1k trophies almost with randoms only.

I like how you tried to team and yet you‚Äôre complaining when people team up against you. This should be under humour

Dynamike usually team with Barleys or other Dynamikes. The Nita was trying to team with me &amp; the other dynamike was trying to kill Her off. So I attacked both of them &amp; we all started teaming together. I'm glad I did this because She killed a Mortis for us.

Actually i usually win with randoms and often get star player but for whatever reason when i play with friends i lose 100% of the time. And they're higher trophies than me.

mortis has absurd mobility to get in and out of action, he controls space way better than the other two. he shouldn't have the same damage that they have. he is a finisher more or less. That being said a 10% damage buff for him is for sure in order.

Great meme
---
Not really throwing a pity party tbh, moreso speaking to how hard supercell has made it for everyone to unlock people. I said to my buddy the other day I‚Äôd almost rather it be easier to unlock characters but harder to level them up so I could at least play as everyone.
---
zzz
---
Sorry I mistaken the star power for ultimate the ultimate is the dimension his star power is in the dimension all allies heal 200 per second
---
her attack is shit at range. the super is good, but loses to lobbers or brocks super for example. imo pam is the least interesting brawler to play, i can barely bring myself to rank her up. i feel like a nerf would push her off to obscurity.
---
exactly, but no one told him to because we all know everyone knows. though this guy doesn't...

He only does damage when you‚Äôre close to him lol, he‚Äôs or that good once you get higher and teams know how to face him

exactly, he is a bad colt. he needs some sort of buff, perhaps if he wasn't so damn squishy he would be somewhat usable.

he didnt even crop the image to make space for the text :(

Sorry, dude. If works as consolation, I'm never lucky in any game. Just spend all my CC again and didn't get Broly in DBLegends, just as an example
---
Ya I guess he‚Äôs just really dominant in the lower trophy range
---
Shelly with a close quarters super power
---
it was done digitally 
---
Yep i met one of my best trophy pushing friends in randoms. Each time we play including the game we met we go up 150 trophies in a single session
---
I think the problem with the easy max of the accounts could have a solution adding special skins to max brawlers for coins and/or accessories for them, being the last thing cosmetic or with an effect (I don't think so, would be kinda unfair). In summary: add more things to spend the gold.
---
They should make this a real gamemode!! 5v5 Team deathmatch with 2 brawlers only!
---
I couldn‚Äôt hit them behind the wall plus frank stops moving when he attacks so it would have left me vulnerable and the one time a could have hit them they all ran off making them get out of range
---
today i got 6 jessies...thanks supercell, by the way, he's brazilian that the answer for his bad english...and for mine...
---
theres not much 2 see, jessie is a kid 
---
Yes, that was 100% problem. Otherwise I would have won! It was clearly all my fault
---
Lmfao
---
He has the highest health in the game (tied with frank) he also has one of the fastest reload speeds in the game.
---
He also has a pretty impressive dps.
---
But he lacks one thing that makes him one of the least viable brawlers in the game.
---
He has the shortest range in the game, plus he has a massive hit box (tied with Frank and pam)
---
play solos until you get to about 2k then you get mediocre teammates
---
Best idea is to make the chicken in to a brawler itself imo. 
---
You can't, they haven't been made yet
---
The only reason I was spinning was to try to team with terra to increase our chance of survival
---
Aight i will make sure to upvote and comment
---
Supercell has tried their best to mitigate teaming but they can‚Äôt control everyone. Some assholes are just gonna keep doing it. I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through that but your jukes were phenominal
---
I am ALMOST maxed on powerpoints which means i only need coins to max out fully
---
And once pp isn't needed anymore, it won't gives u excess pp, instead it will only gives 3 times the coins from boxes

I was complaining about the five person team. If there is a SMALL team of two or in some cases maybe even three that‚Äôs ok. I was trying to team with terra because her super would have rent them and I could have done clean up

Lmao, Pam have everything. "Tankiness", dps, decent range thinking in that damage and healing. Is easy to push and in high trophies everybody use her, maybe to you is boring, but I only want to have her

So basically, if you go choose a game-mode, select the top right box (has to be showdown as it asks for solos or duos), and click where the disappeared chat box (the thing with 3 dots inside) was, it would actually pull up, and if you close that, the showdown box disappears, and you cannot select the solos or duos anymore. This can easily be fixed by exiting or pulling up another game-mode and going back, but this is still a bug. You cannot recreate this bug on a special event showdown as it will pull the screen down and you wouldn't be able to tap where the chat box was.
---
Nicely done! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
You mean nice auto aiming?
---
Ohh i see the Jessie doesn't have enough trophies nor power we need to buff her and make her better 
---
Mortis isnt bad, hes just not versatile and really hard to play, the changes to be made must tweak auto aim

I‚Äôm suggesting that looking a gift horse in the mouth for longer than a minute is a dick move.

Run away, think of your future
---
How high was your user rank
---
Yes he does play a lot, but what about all the other brawlers? They must play a lot too, probably almost as much as the #1 mortis. Yes, top mortises might play more, but the top mortises have more than the top leons.
---
Love this idea! Making it an option in the menu (maybe under accessibility) would keep it from being flamed by anyone who didn‚Äôt like it too! Lol 
---
fair point.
---
Need one wallpaper of rico or spike
---
Dunno if you know this, but bo's star power allow them to see through bushes in a 5-6 tile radius, so having a bo will help a lot as teammates.

As for 2 or more bos, the more bos the more vision.

You would no longer be able to request PP for that brawler.

I have him and I do agree that he needs a nerf. His damage or his blade spread would be a good way to go. Maybe make it so he doesn‚Äôt have such a tight spread

You should be glad that this is the only game where you can max out your account (all brawlers to 500) without gemming.

As for new brawlers, yeah the odds are stacked against F2P players but they still get them eventually.
---
(Im F2P too.)

Yeah when it goes slow like that then it is most likely server not working well. Supercell may have bad servers but they make sure that their games are playable on a ton of devices

r/unpopularopinion

He's honestly not that good. I've never looked at a mortis and been scared of him in showdown. His reload is absolute trash for what he is (literally a guy swinging a shovel). I believe that with a buff this character would be a lot more fun to play than he is and make him an actual threat in anything other than brawl ball or just to throwers

looking a gift horse in the mouth lol. Like seriously? So am I have to tell you that I have actually bought those gems in order to express my view on something about this game?

Again, am I saying that this game totally not enjoyably at all? The fact is that I think this is a good game which with shitty features in some parts, unless you think the matchmaking and teaming thing is so enjoyable in this game.

I respect what you said but this seems way too ridiculous lol.

But how do you check it?

I was playing with randoms today. (They are definitely not randoms anymore.) I won 20 games in a row, pushed my crow up to rank 15. It was amazing. 
---
Tell me about it. Even worse when you think you have him but the son of a bitch gets the double damage in. 
---
That‚Äôs a very small amount of trophies tbh
---
not teaming will most of the time guarantee a loss of trophies. therefore, teaming is a strategy, not cheating. also, brawl stars officially said in one of their old posts that it was fine for people to team. this was said all the way back in beta, where the game was simpler without new global players 
---
Same mechanics, weaker brawler makes him run instead on ambush like bull, he ain't got shit on bull
---
Reminds me of nats 220p stream

This reminds me of Bloons TD battles. Love this skin idea!

---
I one paired with a guy named FATCOCK
---
&gt; weaker brawler makes him run instead on ambush like bull
---
Um what? 
---
&gt;he ain't got shit on bull
---
It's the same as you would complain about Mortus not being able to combat Shelly
---
&gt;Same mechanics,
---
One is an assasin, one is a tank. Totally different.p
---
Darryl is not a tank... He is not ment to be able to kill Bull.
---
Actually btw, if you stayed out of Bulls range, you could kill him as Darryl.
---
I see that you need The Ultimate Darryl Guide
---
First of all, Darryl is _not_ a tank, he is an assasin. His description is a bit misleading.
---
His super can be used to:
---
1) Rolling away. On maps like Thousand Lakes, use the water to extend the roll.
---
2) Attacking. NEVER ATTACK A TANK WITH DARRYL. Thats important. Use the roll to roll towards ranged brawlers (Piper, Jessie, Penny, Frank, Brock sometimes, Colt and Rico (be careful), Bo, Nita, Barley (if super is not charged), Dynamike, Crow and Poco). 
---
Avoid rolling towards enemies with supers charged. Piper, Tara, Nita, Jessie, Crow, Spike and Barley are very dangerous if they have their supers ready.
---
If you roll towards a spawner (Jessie, Penny, Nita), be  careful. Their turrets/bear can cause serious problems, since Darryls hp and dmg aren't good enough to handle two opponents.
---
Remember to aim correctly your super, it's important to get as close as possible to your enemy. If you don't roll right on top of the enemy, you won't deal that much damage, and Barley, Jessie, Penny or Crow e.t.c. may get enough time to charge their supers. If you miss your roll, retreat immediately if there is cover nearby. If not, retreat and hope that they choose to fall back and heal, or keep attacking until your super is charged (this is a bit risky, only do this if you are close enough).
---
I suggest to hide in a bush, since many ranged brawlers come close enough, even when they check the bush, since many don't expect someone to kill them at such a long range.
---
Against tanks Darryl is weak. He can outrange Bull and Primo, and he has the same speed as they have, so you can follow them and deal chip damage at safe distance. Roll away if they suddenly change direction and try to attack. 
---
Spike is easy to kill, as he is so squishy. His super can cause some major trouble!
---
Pam is  a tricky one. She deals great damage and outranges Darryl. I suggest not to attack Pam alone as Darryl. 
---
Frank is easy prey. You can roll close to him and attack. If he tries to super, roll on him. The knockback of Darryls super resets Franks super. Remember, always approach Frank by rolling. If you walk towards him, he can kill you in a couple of shots before you can even touch him. Recharge your super as quickly as possible on him, since you may need it if he tries to super.
---
Ricochet and Colt can be killed easily due to their small hp. But if they are skilled enough, they may kill you with their super while you roll.
---
Brock can be easy to kill, but since Darryl has so little health and Brock does so much damage, it's best to trick him to use his rockets and then roll.
---
Dynamike and Barley are easy to kill, but Barleys super can be lethal if he has time to throw the bottles. Kill him fast!
---
Leon rekts Darryl, as he deals great damage and outranges him. 
---
Darryl can 1v1 Tara, but be careful.
---
Stay away from Crow if your super is not charged. Healing is important for Darryl, and Crows poison can cause major trouble. Never roll against a Crow with hes super ready. If you miss your super, Crow may have time to run away and keep you in poison.
---
Shelly is the ultimate counter to Darryl. She outranges Darryl, and deals too much damage. Never attack Shelly as Darryl.
---
Bo can kill you if his on a high level. You may still be able to kill him. Roll right on top of him.
---
Never roll towards Mortis, he just swipes away and you wasted your super.
---
If your enemy is near death, and you are too, I don't recommend using his super as the final shot that kills the enemy, like you can do with Bull, since Darryls supers damage can easily be overestimated, and you end up rolling away, and the enemy gets an opportunity to escape. Never do this against tanks.
---
Without his super, Darryl is extremely vulnerable. Stay in bushes and do not fight until hes super is charged.
---
Never roll against an enemy without full ammo and health!
---
Play Darryl on the right maps. Open maps, like Thousand Lakes, are good, since he can roll everywhere and use the lakes to extend his super. Maps like Rockwall Brawl are bad, since throwers behind walls are lethal if you play Darryl. Also, there aren't many bushes where you can wait for prey. 
---
Darryl is good in SD, since hes a good camper. As hes super charges automatically, you don't have to attack to charge it, unlike Bull. Hes also good in Brawl Ball, since he can use the knockback of his super to take away the ball from enemies. His super can be used as Mortis attack, throw the ball and roll after it. Hes super is also good in Brawl Ball as it charges so fast.
---
Hide behind boxes in SD, and let the enemy destroy the box. Grab the power cube and super away or towards them!
---
Play him as a flank. Sneak up to the enemy spawn, and roll on them when they are low hp and retreat to the spawn. Then, roll away before they respawn.
---
In Heist he is good at maps like Safe Zone, G. G. Corral and Cactus Corridor, where he can roll over the water. His dps is also high enough to deal significant damage to the safe. When you have attacked the safe and enemies start to respawn, roll away and hide in the bushes near the safe. When the enemies come and attack you, roll back to the safe and attack it. This way, the enemies will try to kill you and forget to attack your safe, and your teammates have time to come and help you.
---
He is best on higher levels, he is too weak on power level 1-4. 
---
His star power helps him a lot, since he can survive more shots.
---
I hope that helped you!
---
atleast someone isnt retarded
---
It is rightü§ó

New Tiny Tower costumes looking good this year
---
Look, they are both built the same, but derryl has weaker stats.
---
Honeatly teamers are complete tryhards, es[ecially if they think they can kill you if you are next to them and have 10 power0ups, they'll still try
---
yee
---
So if you pay money you get punished by matching with sweaty pros
---
Doesn't stand out too much, which is probably why its not getting too much attention. A very creative design and one of the better maps out there. I suggest fabricating the map to be more asymmetrical and diversiform.
---
Teamers HuH
---
Good point. You could report it for low effort.

LOLLLLL
---
Dude said he‚Äôs a high skill-cap not that you‚Äôre not good. 
---
Grind him in Solo SD if you wanna be a high-skill player. He‚Äôs a specific pick and can be lethal in the right hands no matter what game mode; he‚Äôs just not a safe pick like Bull is. 
---
I think you mean "For vain and for glory"
---
Routine
---
Now wr are talking. Looks greate!
---
Most of them are below 1k trophies (atleast for me lol) 
---
Sorry I don't know the name :$
---
The only brawlers he really outranges are heavyweights, he has about the same range as most other brawlers besides sharps. Out damages up close of course because hes a close range assassin, still gets killed by bull/frank easily up close though. Once again he is an assassin and assassins have the highest movespeed. Seriously he dies easily at range, has incredibly low health, and is nothing without his ult to get in close
---
Wow!
---
Leon needs a nerf still 
---
Reminds me of Dolan
---
- Ai wnt mai momy
---
Yeah, since that Leon needed two shots (because he was spamming the auto aim) to take ‚Äòem down. 
---
Yesssss!! 
---
Didn‚Äôt know that
---
Uh... yes
---
Didn't knew I can do that :p
---
Poco her poco. 
---
What is his health though?
---
Try looking up hoe to replace the green screen. If you are having problems doing it, while I am not great, I can replace the green screen with a picture of you send me the full res intro

I was wondering why I suddenly started seeing so many mortis players on hot maze. It didn't help that much, the dynamikes still dominated.

And ya my daddy‚Äôs fat so your daddy probably can

Happy cake day!

Too cluttered.
---
Haha , ty
---
A simple training camp would be nice. Sometimes you just need some practice whether it‚Äôs with a new brawler you just unlocked or a brawler you‚Äôve ranked up but now need to practice some skill/strategy to maybe help get you up higher.
---
Wow did everyone get this offer today? There's got to be a nerf coming if they've done this. Surly cant be too heavy nerf though he's still a legendary after all, I can't see them nerfing it too much 
---
No . I'd rather buy 7 mega boxes instead of leon. Think About the incoming nerf for him which is only a matter of time. He's fun to play but definitly not worth that amount of money in my opinion \^\^'
---

---
He has a watergun?
---
I'm the same way with Gem Grab. So many games thrown because someone with around 10 gems decides to stay in the frontlines instead of running back. I find myself having to play aggressive just to protect them til the countdown ends.
---
but there are 10 of them...Who are they going to team against? 
---
Is it still legendary if everyone has it though? 
---
Another legendary guy who i would never ever get xD
---
Don't get Crow, get Leon points. Crow needs a big buff to compete with the other leggies. Leon is probably about to get nerfed based on this offer, but he's still a great all around brawler for now and probably still will be 
---
Hes also in my shop but I have to spend 15 bucks if I want to get him
---
I'll flip a coin in the morning
---
Doesn't that also mean "the guy"? So it can possibly be positive.
---
You're quality of flirting is SPIKE-ing in the charts :D
---
Tara also needs a black ninja skin with shurkiens for cards
---
thanks dude
---
That's cheap considering the odds. 
---
Is just me or this game have really bad connection problems?
---
wow
---
Me too, but now I have only 20 gems left xD
---
ie 11 coin doubler set.Ie11 mega box. ....
---
What post ?
---
Poco its Teacher Coro?
---
Yeah ur right i forgot the name 
---
I just took advantage of the offer... or should I say the offer took advantage of me (financially)? Anyway, I wanted Leon because crow is way nerfed to the ground, so im happy we have this deal.
---
Lol,I would have to buy the n60gem pack to get this which is like 60 dollars here
---
Boxhead stylee
---
I really feel bad about you 
---
I suggest keeping all your brawlers within a 100 trophies range at all times. You'll understand the game better and will progress more easily.
---
Lmao
---
but at the marshmallow test you get 1 more if you choose not to eat it so if we wont buy this we will get 2 leons?
---
I'd rather spend gems on the box that has a chance of giving me leon rather than wasting $30 for a 100% of getting him
---
Dude.. You're rationalizing really hard right now.

---
how did you made the cutest brawler the most terrifying

Gems?üóª
---
Not really, better buy the level 25 pack offer which is worth it 100%

son of a b*tch u stole the Photo and put your watermark on

Can you post this one more time please? It is so beautiful
---
Ohh okay thanks for the advice bud, appreciated!

That's a dope map, but the center... I think the lake should be removed

Nope

If you have the gems, yes. If you don't have the gems and have to buy them for real money, no

Alright thank you! üòä
---
Learn some English instead of feeling bad for me.
---
I opened this hoping it was some real announcement
---
There‚Äôs suicide almost everyday, how do we know which one is you?
---
Not unless his the only brawler left to unlock. Even so, I wouldn‚Äôt; he‚Äôs probably getting a big nerf soon anyway
---
Kill me. I‚Äôve spent $125 already. And I got the game at global release. 
---
‚Äú oh look at me i‚Äôm an internet troll. I can say anything i want to people and be cocky.‚Äù Please go find a life.
---
When I have free time , I practice draw brawler without seeing picture then you can any bralwer you like and make it cute 
---
Lol
---
You're the internet troll, stop projecting. 
---
You can draw any brawler*
---
Excuse me?
---
That name was on another brawler idea this morning lol
---
And Leon is about to get nerfed too, it's been a long time coming.
---
It's probably best to have Crow over Leon right now, as he's probably gonna get buffed.
---
That's cool! But does that count as a fanart though?
---
Its just for fun really so why not have alil fun right? :) 
---
They‚Äôre trying to tempt you into using money
---
Ok decided not to get him, got Leon and I know he‚Äôs better anyways!
---
Ohh really and you expect us to believe all the players have Leon in the shop 
---
If they are gonna nerf Leon
---
They proberly will make the blades wider if not they risk having everyone who bought it burning their headquarters down.
---
If they really nerf Hp, damg
---
Than help me
---
(I have leon)
---
I‚Äôm just pulling your strings who doesn‚Äôt team 
---
Buying mega boxes is one of the worst ways of spending gems, so yeah.
---
There is no way of hiding if the map is this short. Unless bushes was bigger cover more portion of the map
---
nice
---
Anyway, it's a good map dude, excelent job! 
---
Wat
---
I mean it's up to people how much it's worth to them. Not gonna lie, I bought it. Yeah it's expensive but I've gotten so much entertainment and time out of this game already.
---
I try to base it on comparing an $8 ticket for a 2 hour movie. If I play with Leon for 8 hours total then it's about the same return. That might take a while but I'm sure he'll still be usable even after a nerf. Plus it doesn't mess with my chances of pulling brawlers from any boxes.
---
Just my 2 cents, I absolutely see your argument about it just being pixels on your screen and a couple new moves. It could be better priced for sure, or at least offer more gem deals than the level ones
---
#Art
---
Same happened to me. Got Leon and crow before I even got a mythic brawler. 
---
So true 
---
Same
---
It's fun when there are 15 power cube primo or bull in the bush :)
---
Thats what i thought
---
I read the entire thing and it does make sense personally I‚Äôm not maxed so I would choose token doublers + skins (especially limited time ones)
---
Okay, you got me... 
---
That‚Äôs a great tip thank you 
---
Where do i find the anouncement
---
Your third!! Hope you aren‚Äôt under 4k
---
I'm at player B situation. I got all maxed brawlers besides Leon and like 180 boxes ready to be open + 350 gems. So what I'm going to do is open these boxes I've been saving up and hope to get Leon there.   
---
In case I don't get Leon out of this opening I'll get like 50 gems more, so I'll just purchase the rest of the missing gems and get the Leon offer.
---
No it doesn‚Äôt it says the event is over and kicks you to the main screen
---
New skin confirmed? Hehehe
---
Just got that offer, but crow instead.
---
On Spain yea, but the main translation is uncle
---
Wow that's a really big waste of money
---
Hehe yeah I feel your pain! And I was just messing with you about the editor ;)
---
why are you so sad?go play Duo and hide then let everyone kill each other.
---
Is he really getting nerfed?
---
There is no way to hide your profile... why would you want to hide your profile anyway?
---
there‚Äôs an offer in the shop for everybody but nice try
---
I'm telling your teacher! 
---
Almost didn't see the Leon ther - oh wait there actually IS a Leon in the picture 
---
I figured, just figured I‚Äôd say why i was using it, cause I definitely prefer yours tbh.
---
Yeah I was wondering what the name piper sounds like (trying to figure out the joke) and assumed it would be pipe her but I couldn't think of what pipe her would mean, so thanks for explaining.

Nah just kidding, looks good

Can you have a skins version please &gt;,&lt; I wanna see things like dragon knight jessie
---
I feel like poco‚Äôs voice would be better on spike, spikes voice acting better be good
---
I got the offer today as well
---
Trust me brawl stars is keeping it very conservative with nerfs when it comes to leon because of its legendary status. Look at the first nerf it received for proof. 
---
Most people say yes for that
---
I‚Äôm completely maxed besides him, so I‚Äôm ganna get it....
---
I got the idea from mortis btw
---
Even if they nerf them he would be still viable they wont kill him boys so calm down
---
I got the same offer. Just 30 bucks for one brawler. What a steal!
---
That‚Äôs not boneappletea, just a spelling mistake 
---
And why did you downvote me?
---
Okay since I love the rush ill get it :D
---
That‚Äôs what people used to tell me when I played WoW. Let‚Äôs see, if I eat a healthy meal at subway it‚Äôll cost me $8-10 and possibly more if I am really hungry. That 8-10 dollars is one meal. If you‚Äôre someone that eats out at all, you‚Äôre spending more than someone is on WoW. On WoW, you pay $15 a month for a game that is ever expanding and very well polished in its current form. When you‚Äôre into wow that is all you‚Äôll realistically play.
---
So this is where brawl stars comes in. If they spend like $70 a month combined on Brawl Stars, but they don‚Äôt drink coffee from Starbucks, something that people do 3-5 times a week, they could be saving ~$40. If they don‚Äôt eat out, and cook their own meals and live by their means, they‚Äôre saving a lot more.
---
If brawl stars and clash royale is how they pass their time they are probably literally saving money by paying into the game. AAA titles that come out now have micro transactions themselves that are more fierce than brawl stars. And they probably wouldn‚Äôt enjoy the same games on console (on console you pay for the system and $60 a year for online) or on pc so that would be a cost of probably a game a month each. If they‚Äôre spending $120 a month on a game each, and then getting bored, they‚Äôre saving a ridiculous amount of money.
---
Lifestyle is what determines who is successful with money. Not their current state of finances or anything else.
---
I'm not English. What's a marshmellow test?
---
Not not not  Nerf Leon nota you s√≥ long sucker not you leon Nerf
---
omg I think my idea is a bit same to yours ;;;-;;; and I haven‚Äôt done it yet
---
Im almost lvl 60 i got no legendaries and one epic...
---
Dota and fortnite‚Äôs earnings would make supercell blush. Have you seen the dota2 TI prizepool? 
---
The chest isn‚Äôt worth it. He is mostly debating buying Leon.
---
They said that they have everything ready and they just need to upgrade/update their servers when they want too. That‚Äôs why it says disabled.
---
Because his damage is super high and super makes it easy to sneak up on people and melt them before they can react to you appearing out of nowhere. 
---
√Ñ
---
Your experience is false, you get cards in the shop far more often. Also you can just obtain every card for free and use it to play competetively which you can't in brawl stars
---
Thats how mafia works.
---
On days like this teamers like you should be burning in Hell 
---
I could potentially help you...
---
Join this new club: apenation 
---
Well I wanted to stick to the same format. üòñ didn‚Äôt think it would be as noticeable 
---
Hey I‚Äôm just refuting this other persons comment. He said to get a legendary it costs like 10x as much as it does to buy Leon here, and it just simply isn‚Äôt true. Then he went and said yeah but you have to spend thousands to level it up for ladder and nowadays you just trade for it / get lots of legendaries in tournaments and rewards 
---
At least it‚Äôs more worthwhile than the token doubler, which is slightly less value than the tickets (only if you can max events)
---
That really is very detailed.
---
The game has been released for only 7 monthsüòÖ
---
Those notifications...
---
How do you calculate the winner? Is it the player with the most wins, the player with the most wins in comparison to loses or something I didn‚Äôt think of?
---
ü§îthat‚Äôs a good idea I will try to make the skins
---
The cloud looks weird, maybe add some lightnings?

But it looks great!

I have it rn 2
---
I can help with that! I have lvl 5 leon
---
oh lol couldn‚Äôt catch that
---
It's true, my experience was always full with common and rates and some epics, I didn't play that game was almost 1 year, so I don't how the state the game right now
---
Thanks boi ‚ù§
---
Such a nice game.. Glue Storm would be op
---
How do you get to this page?
---
Blammo I got the offer as well. Instabuy. I had the gems saved from the level up reward packs.
---
Good day!
---
It‚Äôs not necessarily Leon in the offer. If you also don‚Äôt have crow or spike the offer could be for them instead. Obviously they‚Äôre trying to make money but it probably doesn‚Äôt have to do with the nerf.
---
Wait you know The Hero in BTD6 "Quincy" And that flamethrower guy right? If they do a crossover, that would be amazing!
---
Its just a quick draw but it is free to improve
---
&gt;I didn't play that game was almost 1 year
---
So basically you have no actual clue what you're talking about
---
Picked mega box, got frank
---
that‚Äôd be sick Id love a btd6 hero based on a bull or something it could have a shotgun attack.
---
Nice work
---
Soon to be one of the worst in the meta. Cheap lmao
---
Star Power: Enemies leave a blob of glue after being shot, slowing anyone stepping on it
---
Thanks man! Really appreciate it. Took me a lot of time to achieve those fine details.
---
Crows in the shop for me. I have Leon. 
---
Yah but 1 legendary is useless to most people. You‚Äôre going to need to spend a lot more than 5 to get you‚Äôre legendary to a good level.
---
Well that $30 could have been saved for future
---
Is this for everyone or just for the ones that have all the other brawlers (except for legendaries)
---
Got both Leon and the Mega. Got Spike out of the Mega. Now I have TWO new brawlers to suck with!
---
It wont actually make your chances higher but it makes you feel good
---
I'll do more soon!
---
While I don‚Äôt necessarily agree with the expectations in regards to the timeline, I do agree that these are all things that should be added over the next six months or so. 
---
Also, Ricochet needs a buff more than anyone. 
---
Same! After buying Leon...
---
Be Shelly, charge your ult 2/3rds of the way then go in the Bush. One normal shot and one super obliterates them
---
One of my friends got 2 legendary brawlers within two weeks, without spending any money on the game.
---
After 4 weeks he had every brawler except Leon - like me, but i needed 1.5 years to unlock them  =/
---
Lol i didn't
---
Now there's three of us, weird.
---
Yup.
---
I have posted 
---
Ah ah i love these guy that do not know what is solo showdown in brawl stars ahah
---

---
Marvel Strike Force was selling heros for fiddy. There's money to be made!
---
Did u actually pull him or did you pay for him... ;)
---
try me
---
Did everyone get this deal? I got it too
---
Not based but the exact Bull and name.. Would be awesome either way haha..
---
if they'd need crow again he would be a wood league character
---
Yes, maybe a little more HP than the ricochet
---
You and your wallet will be happy to hear that this game is way more f2p friendly than any other supercell games
---
I almost spit milk on my 1000 dollar device. LOL
---
The next brawler i get will definitely be a legendary as i have all epics and mythics and i also didn't spend any money on the game,and the game has been out for 7 months how have you been playing since 1.5 years(correct me if im wrong cause i might be wrong .-.)
---
It is obviously shopped because these are no more bonuses displayed in the photo
---
This is seriously great!
---
But it's kinda creepy seeing what looks like a grown ass man wearing a frog hoodie.
---
Nice! Idk why your not getting complimented by other people
---
Gacha game player here I‚Äôm not going to spend $30 to get Leon but it really is a decent deal to be able to guarantee getting a legendary for pay to play players rather than just taking their chances with boxes
---
Good luck everybody 
---
i got the offer for crow though ,u,
---
prolly lyin
---
Good idea! it would be a good improvement
---
Snipers and characters who one shot people are present in almost any game 
---
What the heck I feel bad for you man I‚Äôm rank 15 with 2 epics atleast and one of my friends snagged a legendary from a brawl box at like rank 20
---
Delete and repost with a watermark
---
So that means he completed all set except legendary
---
PS. There must be no space betwen the name and the comands. 
---
Bull was hiding in the bush for 90% of the match so it was a 3v1 for the most part.... I could always kills crow and nita but I would die to pam(gem carrier), but if I targeted pam then I would get rekt by the other two lol
---
Can‚Äôt really get me to spend ten dollars on a mobile game 
---
doubt it, it would limit the amount of people who spend money on the game
---
Noice!
---
go to her shop ingame, select a box and tap the i Button in the upper right. theres a complete list with unlock chances and a text explaining that the chances get better the more boxes you open
---
Clash Royale had the same problem with legendaries when they first came out, and as we can see over time they became easier to get. I bet this happens here too. Eventually.
---
I have played since the start of beta and dont have any legendarys so this is a definite grab for me
---
What about 6 purchases of $5?

Study

Thanks!but it have some problems

I always just see maxed bos there
---
STOLEN
---
Thx! He is an Frog 
---
You better bullieve it
---
Maybe I didn't make that clear originally. I do agree that for the drop rates, it makes sense. 
---
But I also think that these extortion level prices are something that should be seriously looked at across the mobile industry.
---
Again I do like BS, it's not a cash grab, and they attempt to put more focus on aesthetic upgrades rather than kinesthetic upgrades. But an attempt isn't a complete action, and the remnants of gacha mobile games is still there.
---
I‚Äôll smash and grab
---
You didn‚Äôt get away
---
Theres 100% gonna be a nerf and supercell is finessing everyones money rn, but they‚Äôre not going to nerf leon to the ground lol. He‚Äôs a legendary, he has to be dependable if he has that type of rarity 
---
True
---
Oh wow, in terms of brawlers unlocked, thats way worse.. I guess your luck stat in the brawl boxes is even higher than mine right now. 
---
Anyway, good Luck with your next boxes! 
---
Definitely Bo.

it‚Äôs just a matter of tapping vs dragging, I don‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs a toggle. You‚Äôll get most characters within a week of playing, I‚Äôd say. And it isn‚Äôt as p2p as CoC, sure there‚Äôs purchases but I‚Äôve spent $100 and I‚Äôm only missing Leon. 
---
well, maybe. but the doublers would give you 110 boxes to Open with a chance to unlock a brawler along with all the other Box contents. 
---
I had something like this 3 times today
---
Thanks dude! 
---
It's 0.18 rn. There was a guy saying that an average player unlocks a legendary in two months, and the chance to get your first would be 95% in 6 months.
---
If I even got a mythic...

Since my name is pretty short I went for an interesting combination of colors:

Oh ok. Anyways, thanks for you feedback.

As a greek myself....i Approve this. Just 10 seconds is TOO OP. Maybe 6-5 seconds

You're very talented !!!

I would suggest to add wings at the back as it would also satisfy his star Power (when he'll jump)

If you spend $40 on a mobile game you need to re-evaluate your life, nerd.

You shouldn't spend your coins if you just have like 2000 coins or less, but if you have more i would spend them

I want you to give Brawl Stars such a thing as balance, for example, you play in SHOWDOWN and there scored points for example 10 000 damage in 10 points 100 000 IS 100 points and so on. And in Heist the same but in another algoritm for example: if you inflict 10 000 damage to a safe at this time eg if you hit 10 000 damage to the safe at this time eg if you hit 10 000 damage to the safe in 50 seconds you get 50 points if you did not destroy the safe at this time but you inflicted 10 000 damage then you!!!

Ban worthy ?

---
Happy reddit bday man!
---
Hahahahaha
---
I thought people can see in the pic how many gems i have. I need around 500 more to buy leon
---
Level? if more than 5 then good game dude gz :)
---
You can see the colour change before you confirm. 
---
That‚Äôs a sick Idea because it would be good for long range and short range with good bush cover and less walls 
---
Suomi spotted
---
Yes it is
---
How do they open the boxes without weapons?
---
Also, would El Primo have his weapons by default, given they're attached to his arms?
---
Wow this makes me sad
---
I‚Äôve had it for a week and I have that except from piper
---
Amazing skin!! Please add this supercell
---
superr
---
I actually enjoy Crow more than Leon!
---
But is the offer worth it?
---
Surprised spike
---
Smart
---
Would still be nice to know what the cutoff is
---
So? U can buy gems with money, i though even New players know how to scroll shop.
---
Can we all just acknowledge that chameleon
---
That's my boy
---
Kk
---
Yea but i dont feel like spending money on a game that is free
---
Is ok, buy the mega box, then
---
&gt; **This is my design**
---
Shit, cover blown.
---
See, I'm not a loser who mains Tara because I was lucky enough to get something rare
---
I'd change the name
---
You don'f want them Nintendo Ninjas on you
---
Never heard of that feeling
---
ITS not cheap and not worth it since he'll be nerfed anyway. 
---
That's the level packages, not the gem one. I am talking about the 2000 gems. Most expensive purchase possible. Sorry if it confused you
---
I bought it too. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre poor brother 
---
Initially available only fists. A few blows open the boxes. From there falls the weapon. And in the next, if you don‚Äôt like the weapon, just don‚Äôt take it even for 10 seconds, it disappears.
---
Congratulations he is one of the coolest characters in the game.
---
And welcome to the buff him train. You'll understand in due time.
---
G-1
---
Nah
---
Sorry for bad quality ;( the blurred word says teamer
---
I understand what you‚Äôre saying. At the same time, there have been plenty of people who pay more than that to unsuccessfully pull Leon. Sure, they get power points and coins, but this guaranteed offer is a better option than pulling at straws with boxes.
---
The gambling aspect of pulling boxes is much more dangerous for the consumer than paying an upfront price in my opinion. Just my 0.02.
---
Hell, sounds like I need to hit 35. That‚Äôs a killer deal. 
---
E+1
---
What color is blue 
---
It‚Äôs hard cause I bought all the level up offers and got no mythics or legendaries so it‚Äôs a chance you take. 
---
he will get nerfed for sure, but not to death. Why would they do that?
---
Sounds exactly like Zeus in DotA
---
If your new to the game i would wait and save up gems and buy coin doublers and unlock all the heros and not buy just one character thats probably going to be nerfed soon
---
is it also possible when buying it on an iphone?
---
For -10 trophies üëå
---
You are a disgrace for this üòÇ
---
They've promised you current Leon. If they weaken him, it's not what was promised with the purchase. They have to wait at least a month to weaken him.
---
No and I don't believe so either. If it was to the point where the card or things became unusable and dropped from like S tier to F tier then I could see it as that though, but I don't have examples of that really being the case.
---
I don't know, maybe patch notes or potential not set in stone changes could be outlined when this is being offered so players know that, oh I'm buying this character and he is going to be a little different in a week or so but that's okay because I bought him knowing for sure what is going to happen.
---
But yeah it is common 
---
You can only play bots 
---
In inglese si chiama Crow!!
---
Si vede...
---
You aren't a OG Brawler
---
Know exactly how much he damages so you are sure when you can go in to get the kill. Also he can dodge shoots easily so you can try to make the opponent target you instead of another teammate.
---
I'm sure it gets annoying, but seriously it's a good move. I'm 30. When I was 16, I had a part time job at Dominos. My parents only made me save 50 a month or something like that from each paycheck, but the rest? I blew it all on car audio for my $2000 car. Literal waste of money. I wish my parents were stricter on me with how I spent but I'm not blaming them.
---
Current spending habits? About the same, even though I make 80K a year. I haven't learned and it's tough trying to save for a house when I have zero willpower or self control because I still don't know the value of a dollar. "It's ONLY 30 dollars for Leon!" went through my head. 30 dollars is food for a month for some people.
---
Not saying any of this applies to you but just wanted to share my experience! Good luck!
---
thanks!
---
Which is why you have content creators and 11k players saying he needs a nerf.
---
‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôll try and sneak in a couple trophies with Mortis here‚Äù -10 before I blink

Leon in the shop is just a money grab before they announce a nerf in the next week or so. 
---
At least I got Leon this morning...
---
The cloud is very on point but it would be easy to spot coming down if that‚Äôs his super. Other than that I‚Äôm in love with this skin ! good Job!!
---
Well, it was :)
---
The thing is, this actually happened to me this morning.
---
7 or fewer
---
It's also posted on their Instagram
---
That's still crazy. I've been playing for a month and I need someone new. xD
---
Well taxes in Europe are between 15 and 24% iirc. So I think they just did an average price for the whole euro zone (euro currency obviously)
---
well...you could buy santamike
---
The real question is why it's Leon that main guy?
---
I already have Spike and just missing Crow and Leon. I really am in a dilemma here also. Plus the nerf hammer might come crashing down on Leon after the sale, which reduces his value by a lot.
---
Nice
---
I think just movement speed
---
For the 24th time. Buy him if you REALLY want Leon, keep in mind however that he is gonna get nerfed, i mean why else Supercell would give an OP character for everyone to buy? lol
---
The last special offer you can purchase is at lv 35. I found it on the brawl stars wikia. 
---
Yes ! That's what we are used to. But in this case, it's even higher than the X$. That's why I was surprised
---
Exactly so lets say you have Leon in your shop but if you have gotten another Legendary Brawler first in the brawl boxes, aka, Spike or Crow, if you are willing to spend 549 gems, you can make it so that you could get two legendary brawlers
---
Y do u always want free stuff?
---
Do you ever get free things in real life?
---
This is how the world works kid
---
Darryl paradise
---
Remake the old roll
---
So at least the level based offers 
---
You Know how it works
---
I‚Äôm only asking because in all honesty, I‚Äôm unsure  how long it will take me to get him from a normal box. Or if I‚Äôm going to spend that much money to get him in the long run. 
---

---
$100 for a chocolate bar is expensive... $100 for a car is suddenly cheap!

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNDERRATED COMMENT

I like how this is hand made compared to other arts.
---
Youre welcome
---
At first I thought the middle was uncrossable unless it is Bull with Super, Dyna with Star Power, El Primo with Super, Darryl with Super, Piper with Super and Crow with Super. But you could destroy the boxes/barrels with maybe a Brock. This looks like an actual Sniper Bounty map rather than the obnoxious maps we have currently. Upvote! 
---
They arn't for anything but some people like their name colored. You can color your name with a special code: &lt;c#&gt;name&lt;/c&gt; 
---
Instade of # use a number of 1-5 and instade of name put the name in you want to color
---
Dope!
---
I mean 90% of the showdown maps you should be using bull. It completely depends on the map. But when there is a large bush in the center i‚Äôm running bull.

This is great!

I am only missing leon yet still feeling envious. Weird...

You have a 4 character name limit IIRC. It only let me do 4 letters as there character limit includes CSS
---
I got a crow offer cus I already had Leon 
---
You‚Äôd have to be a top player first for that to matter portal! 
---
I kid I kid.
---
There is also a certain range where you can't hit them. Either it's too close or too far.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if a brawler can have more than 3 skins tho. Supercell would have to add another slot.
---
Yep
---
That happened to me in Clash Royale sometimes
---
seriously who plays roblox these days
---
Nope. Supercell has banned so many accounts for no reason in other games, it is nkt the first time.
---
Are you just snapping at him because he was correct about something easy to verify?
---
I need some assitance i want to make sure im doing this correct because i really dont want to mess this up could someone help me out?
---
what ‚Äúpirate cat‚Äù ? üòÇ
---
Many people get banned for no reason! Hope they understand their mistake mate!
---
Same could be said for Leon. He pokes you at insane distances and the moment you get close, he shreds you. 
---
Since it's not my concept: Idk. He might be very strong in Gem Grab or Brawl Ball. It is a really cool concept xD
---
Yes, in 2017 it was 6 slots
---
That explains it then. I‚Äôve put a little money into the game, but not much. Mostly just the level deals.

of course
---
and wrong use of meme
---

---
Maybe that will be fine, doing it a second time might not be a good idea.  
---
Although aren't there more consequences for being negative balance though? Like not being able to get free offers and participate in events or tournaments? 
---
I hope they featured it!!!
---
I remember when I played some solo showdown then i made two kills and thought it's starting good until the map got smaller but there were still 8 brawlers left, then i got to the center of the map just to see the other 7 people made a team and it was a 7 vs 1 and i didn't even got near to any of them to damage them and after i got killed i thought if i could kill one or two of them i would still lose trophies. So solo showdown is cancer
---
did the offer change to crow (if you didnt have him) or disappear?
---
this keeps happening to me
---
I feel like she's pretty easy to play since she's so tanky and has quite a bit of damage. That being said I feel like I don't see many people playing her to her best ability. I'll give a quick example. 
---
In any match where you have walls, you never want to drop your radius heal inside the middle of everything. You always want it in grass or behind a wall. Even better both lol 
---
Now, if you you also don't want to drop your radius heal too far where everyone needs to leave the fight to heal. You want it close enough so you can stay within and keep in range pushing people back, while letting your squad run through to get drive by heals. 
---
Now you also want to be careful of who you're matched up against. Say you're facing off against Penny or even worse Jessie, you'll want to switch up your location possibly so that it's not sticking out of a corner by a wall or anything like that. You want to be sure you aren't dropping a stand still target for them to hit that will then ricochet to you and your teammates. 
---
I've got some more if people are interested :)
---
It is. You can't really compare him to leon though. Leon is a poker and shredder but if you are against stretchy boi you just can't get to him. You get close then boop!
---
That‚Äôs not how video games works lmao. 
---
Gems my friend, gems. Not crystals.
---
You brought him lol
---
Post this to r/brawlstarscompetitive. It‚Äôll be of more use to people there than here, just because those are people geared toward getting better and there are less posts there, which means everyone there will read through it
---

---
Thanks. Same to you bro! Happy birthday! 
---
‚ù§Ô∏è Love this!
---
What's this supposed to be
---
Same! I got the game on global release and I‚Äôve been getting new characters in what seems like a good progression rate. Already have 12/22 with my rarest being Frank, Tara, Darryl, and ricochet. I‚Äôm still only at around 1600-1700 trophies but haven‚Äôt gotten any new brawlers as quickly as I was before. Maybe I‚Äôll get him at the very last second but idk. I need others opinions lol.
---
Leon needs a buff but crow is op
---
Nice, but it should just be for ‚Äúmanual‚Äù things, like the one you mentioned, not toggles for, like, abilities.
---
Also they could be type-specific, for example throwers in this case.
---
300 gems üëÄ
---
Thinking of buying the level 35 pack to get enough gems to buy him since I already have 300.
---
Gotta give people time to buy Leon before they nerf him.

---
For real though, I would take Tara, Frank, and Piper over crow any day of the week. You got the luckiest drops (spike and leon) and the unluckiest luckiest drop (crow). You got a lucky streak of the luckiest drops, but got unlucky with a drought of the common drops

If many brawlers could counter him he wouldn‚Äòt be as oppressive. He has speed, range, damage, an ulti to get into cqb against brawlers like barley, dynamike and colt and way too much health for all that damage and utility. He doesn‚Äòt need to deal with Bull because he has range so he‚Äòs no countered but neutralized until his ultimate. 
---
wtf dude it should be Scientist and Cient√≠fico
---
This does not work as good as dropping on the ground would be. If someone is chasing you straight up as dynamike you want to drop tnt where you are so that both dynamite sticks will hit if they keep chasing you. On the right or left only 1 stick will hit if they move slightly in response

Very true but you only get about 7 boxes per reset. With a legendary chance being at like .1 on average, a small boost in luck value would be nice. I do see ur point tho. The main idea of the season box was the keep the rewards already received at each reset (I.g. Seven boxes) but give them all at once similar to a mega box and with a higher chance for higher rarity brawlers

Stop whining about matchmaking. Seriously. Stop.

Good bot.

Cheapest way would be not spending any money at all. And Grinding.

i dont get why people in 0-30 range complain, since u dont lose any trophy and have the chance to play agaunst more xp opponents
---
They put leon as the first one because he is op and everyone wants him so there's a high chance some people gonna spend some money for him, but they probably gonna nerf him. The second one is crow cause he's the weakest legendary and they don't want that people with money buy leon then get spike as an offer and buy him too then get crow and he's too weak to spend money for him so if you want leon and spike you have to buy crow too
---
very cool concept
---
Buy it. You have such a low leggy chance. Totally worth it.  Buy HIM
---
I tagged you in the ‚Äúproof‚Äù stay salty lil bitch boy ü•∫
---
Worth
---
I just got him from the offer and I feel mixed emotions. Like I‚Äôm happy but that costs a lot but oh well at least I didn‚Äôt buy skins or something. And I‚Äôm still missing spike so not like I‚Äôd pull both of them
---
Are you still able to get legendary brawler offers in the shop? Im not talking about the current leon offer cause that is very over priced and is offered to everyone. and if you look at youtuber bentimm1's video it cost him 449 gems instead of the 554 gems last month. 
---
Tldr. My question is will i be able to get another offer like bentimm1s offer while not owning mythic or epic brawler?
---
Thanks in advance
---
Would u know thid1
---
That‚Äôs how Mafia works
---
It seems very similar to el primo in terms of its basic attack.
---
Thats because thats exactly what it is
---
Well, i have Nita 500 trophies (although i only play only in showdown lol), but let me tell you that her bear is REALLY usefull. You can use it either for attack or defense \[Tank shots and follow the person the bear is focusing, or use it when you are running away (Like running away from a colt or ricochet)\], but don't throw it against a Bull, Shelly, Primo or Darryl, since they can kill the bear with only 2 or 3 shots. When you are facing a Dynamike or Barley, use the bear agressively (They have low health, so the bear is gonna make them back off), Try not to run away when you throw your bear against them (Unless you have low hp), since they are throwers, they can attack you even if the bear follows them, so be carefull.

I dont know about that

r/lootstars

His star power is absolutely broken though

[Add On] Dont judge my amount of gems I made a bad choice.

Donno Soz
---
That would last 20 minutes 
---
Yeah.  Or spike.  (I had spike.  Got him.  Completed my brawler collection.  Am happy.)
---
This is awesome
---
Sure, let me grind 400 gems. So easy. 
---
Yeah im going big lmao.  Having so much fun with leon even tho he might need a nerf at long ranges 
---
I would much rather pay a lil bit more and have social security then pay less for a mobile game but beeing homeless after breaking a leg or goin to the dentist

Yeah, i wouldn't do that, since you only have one name change and using it just to change your name color is just a bad idea lol
---
Yes very informative! I would have never thought the gem carrier would go in the middle, thanks for clarifying!!

...you can buy him and grind trophies before he gets nerfed... you missed the point of what I was saying completely
