Many of these aesthetically-pleasing maps get more votes than some maps that are not as "good looking" but have good gameplay.
---
As far as your map goes, it's basically the water that's the issue. I don't think it can be fixed without ruining the theme of your map (as in a fix would make it not look so much like a spiral). Like I said, it looks good, but the majority of these maps that look good are generally not good for gameplay. Don't get me wrong - uniqueness is VERY important. But it's not all about the looks. You gotta have both
---
You have only 4 ways to enter the midgame part of the map. That is by far the biggest problem of the map. You may add more ways to enter the midgame part, but I'm not sure that will solve the problem either. The path to get to the midgame is too long. So you'd have to cut down a lot of water, and that would probably ruin the theme of your map and take away its uniqueness.
---
The transition from midgame to endgame isn't as bad. There still are only 4 paths, but the length of the paths isn't as long. I think it's still an issue though, and making the paths shorter, cutting out water again will take away from the theme of your map.
---
I think you need to find a way to do this without water. A spiral map could definitely work (Eye of Storm is one of those good-looking maps that still has good gameplay). But you're gonna have to take out some of the beauty and add some stuff that focuses more on gameplay

Yes. Get a good team together and play gem grab or siege with him. Mortis is insanely good at controlling games. People get so weird about him. Don‚Äôt be stupidly aggressive but make your presence felt at all times.

You have some very solid points there my friend. Making the middle ring (the empty one) wider might make the midgame more bearable, with that new space i could kinda get creative with more stuff, while keeping the overall theme there. I think I could also make some new entrances to the midgame too without making it look bad. 
---
I'll try it out and see how it turns out.
---
Until you get about 1100 shush
---
This gave me an idea, why not add another Gamemode slot, but fill it with the other game modes, except half of the brawlers (chosen randomly) are banned and can't be played? Imagine all the diversity and crazy new strategies you'd see pop up.

128 is the maximum you can get from a showdown match. It requires a rank up of a brawler, an experience level up, and a first place victory all to occur at the same time. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm pumped about this.

what a splendid art of workÔºÅ

The problem was in the system all along
---
Such a good strategy lmao
---
It has always been like this. The first team to get to 10 gems starts a countdown, until they either: A) lose gems and drop below 10 or B) the other team gets 10 gems too. In the second case, the countdown will start again when one of the teams gets at least one more gem than the other. So yeah, it's perfectly possible to lose while having 10, 13 or 20 gems, it doesn't matter if the other team has more. But it has been like that literally since day one, you just realized it now?
---
What are you talking about? She did twice already lol.
---
Lmao yee start a phoenix series where specific brawlers have at least some relation to a phoenix (in this case, her golden feather and flaming cards)
---
Yeah his voice is annoying af
---
I think it happens to alot of players. Im 10k, queing me up with those 2k 3k. Trophies down the drain. The dev team said its fix. It require longer queing time. But grats its the same shit
---
Is it because all of your brawlers are maxed? Or because you aren't getting the brawler cards you need?
---
I am fairly new and still have a lot of upgrades to do. Short on gold.

The amount of boxes are fine. You just need more cover.

I mean I don‚Äôt mind playing with 2-3k if they match me with them and another 12k with a 2-3k players I wouldn‚Äôt mind at all. But to give me those two players vs a 7k, 13k, and 15k... I mean that just doesn‚Äôt make any sense. I would have rather have waited 2-3 min then play games like that. They need to fix it people would rather wait and play quality games rather than trash like this.

Hi! I am wondering if you can buff the star power on crow because his star power side very weak and crow is a legendary. Could you make it from 10%to 20% because it is hard to make a star power and it is so so weak. Tanks!

*_Hmm_*

What are they doing in the dark web???
---
I‚Äôm at 3100 and have Tara but no epic heroes

tara decides head home back as soon as they were giving their preference
---
Yes, it happens a lot. I'm trying to get to 7k but damn it's hard when I'm constantly getting players at 2k-3k at best in my team. Sometimes I even get players at 200-300 total trophies, it's frustrating. Meanwhile, my oponents are usually at the level they should be, at 5k-7k. With the occasional team of 10k-13k here and there. So fair.

Anyone think this is a new map theme? Like the City theme we got back in Lunar New Year. Although that might be too simple for this big of a tease. I think new map theme is at least one of the new stuff.
---
Still, he had that 1 and that's the point
---
Where is the evidence?
---
Already exists
---

I want it üëç

nice one

Yoooo that's awesome

Gedi Kor finally has my attention üëÄ
---
‚ÄúI use drugs every day and I am fine‚Äù
---
Pizza cutters on bulls boots XD 
---
I saw them when BS was released (idk if they were in beta)
---
both games are fun  BTW  poco is the evil one
---
Looks like splatoon!
---
I saw GEDI-KOR and upvoted before the picture loaded.
---
I think I do...
---
You as dynamike has to hate healing mushrooms, right?
---
Where's the broken invisible hitbox though? :(
---
Red outline if they exceed your power level/trophies by a significant amount like they usually do
---
haha i see
---
No, because I do not team at all at any circumstances!
---
I think not
---
Slippin down the tishes
---
I got one at lvl 75. But idk if there is one at lvl 65. Sry
---
The brawl star simble isnt very good
---
Ooooh maybe he throws spray paint bottles or paint?
---
:o

~~Jungle book~~

what?!
---
Remember when PvZ 2 was slightly more f2p friendly?
---
Ss
---
Lol why?
---
Splatoon much?
---
You thief ! You stole this
---
Chill man.
---
Honestly, not a bad interpretation of the clues.  It's as good, if not better, than any others I've seen on here or on YouTube.
---
Wrong subreddit.
---
Put a watermark
---
This is fucken stupid
---
No I didn‚Äôt I deleted my old one
---
Because he is spinning anti clockwise
---
You... Lazy developers
---
u/Engrish
---
Could you make a Robo Piper next? Especially with cluster grenades and rocket on her parasol to make it more awesome and absurd
---
Don't repost my stuff without my permission please, thanks.

They have 26 videos for at least two weeks now.
---
Ok, I delete it
---
We reached a quarter of 13 thousand upvotes

Is it real?
---
Because people like you exist who don't want to teach them

Chaaa

Welcome to the cult

Understimated cment
---
yeah this would be a great optional screen, it‚Äôs a little cluttered to be the default.
---
I'm sad now
---
Thanks manüî•
---
Honestly, rose is more balanced than Leon pre Nerf.
---
She have low range and no way to close distance.
---
You Just Need to keep distance to her while chip away her health.
---
However i agree She Is difficult to beat as a close range fighter, however She Is meant to be a tank that counter shotgunners and tanks.
---
Honestly, the Only Nerf She Need Is poison and dot effects bypassing her damage reduction.
---
To make it simple to see?
---
Aweful and awful mean completely different things
---
It takes less than 2 days to film and edit brawl talk.
---
holy shit thags a lotsa stuff
---
r/lostredditors
---
Yeah
---
Still, they won't upload it right away.
---
And maybe to celebrate this change, we get some themed skins and new game mode environment or even a whole new game mode.
---
Instead of having to look at their player, which is difficult on snake prairie!!
---
 Forgot what sub I was in for a second
---
pues por que no, no te digo que no haga falta un sistema, pero no creo que los reportes sean necesarios adem√°s de que para eso en espec√≠fico un sistema de reports sea bastante lento
---
It'd be better in lot of things, but not actually cleaner, currently brawler screen is cleaner because it has more space between each thing
---
Her super creates a temporary toilet and flushes everyone into it.
---
Xlayder is romnian youtuber salut romani
---
My Barley was at 497 and then I tilt he until 467...
---
How do you like it?
---
Worst brawl stars problem.
---
You're either a fucking dumbass or have such a useless life you gotta be an asshole on the internet. Guess what dumbass, not everyone sees what you see. People like you make me wish the world would burn. Go waste someone else's time.
---
Without. I‚Äôm not an animal.
---
*Cavern Churn*
---
It is literally on the title
---
Holy shXt this is awesome!
---
me when Rosa came out and all 10 showdown players had her
---
I'm very emotionally charged today. Sorry. Let me explain why.
---
Okay, so you're new to reddit. Reddit is pretty weird to understand at times, but often in subs there is a problem with content and duplicity. I among other content creators on the sub think that it's a shame about how many posts just seem to be the exact same things over and over again, and (along with IRL events) has pushed me to this point where I ain't having it. In this case I am definitely in the wrong though. I should have noticed you're new to reddit and that you probably didn't see the recent Marvel-themed posts and yeah. I'm sorry.
---
I'm not a young kid, but I've never used Reddit until now. I don't think he understands, my first thought when making a Reddit isn't "Let me find every single Humor content there is".
---
What are you referring to, because the matchmaking seems fine
---
I'm P2W
---
Lol I would just imagine reeling in an 18 powercube Spike and yeeting them into the storm
---

No si ya, si no digo que sea f√°cil, pero jope, deber√≠an echarle un ojo ...

Y gracias por responder üòÉ

I Will rather kick out loaded Rico (golden one)
---
Sorry for calling you those names but why you have to attack me for something I didn't know. I just made a Reddit so I can share replays and hopeful try at making memes or humor stuff.
---
Now we wait for the next (presumed) Epic Brawler....
---
Credit?
---
We already got the Crow buff, if you haven't been paying attention.
---
He needs a health buff and people want more but the rosa nerf is taking up all the attention.
---
And darrel as a dico ball LOL THIS NEEDS TO HAPPEN
---
Because I was really angry in the first place and this post was just the tipping point. It was a real dick move and I'm sorry.
---
T R I G G E R E D
---
I like this design! Keep up the good work!!
---
Best of the best
---
Sorry if this has been said before, just thought it would be nice to have something to make the star power known
---
This gud me me
---
Yeah sadly his super is pretty exploitable I hate that he makes a sound when he uses it so everyone is on alert for you and starts shooting and it makes no sense how if one person sees you everyone in the area can see you
---
Leon is the only one that properly uses a conputer
---
On what? genieHub?!
---
Agreed x4
---
But you need that star token!
---
The correct flair would probably "Ask" or "Discussion", also I think it should be more obvious or else people don't take the time to understand it and don't upvote :(
---
but you can have mines ;}
---
It‚Äôs the only good tactic
---
Just dont touch rosa anymore
---
Story of my life.
---
THANK YOU I LOVE YOU AAA
---
***AWAKEN MY ROBOT***
---
Why would a robot eat grass lol...and also I dont even think robots eat anything lul
---
80 coins... Not bad
---
Also, this is my second post so can someone tell me how to create a background.
---
This is really good
---
Step 2: die
---
for real what he said is 100% true I can confirm supercell hates Leon
---
oh, thank you
---
Shotguns would be complicated
---
He deserved it, didn't he?
---
dude at least you got gems.
---
My favorite part is that the Frank that almost died in the begining and started the train was the one to kill them all.
---
Edit: JK...rewatched it and yeah...
---
It's not bad but I've been waiting for star power for more than a month
---
A U T O A I M
---
This was so creative I love it, but still I do think Leon is a quite person
---
What? LmaoüòÇi was laughing through whole video
---
Crow.literally every single spike shot can be dodged if you are a skilled enough Crow Mortis or Leon
---
Needed to get on my second account so I could upvote twice.
---
Same
---
Conga conga conga! Eh look at me go!
---
I just cant. Sorry, but its downvote.
---
This is so cute! Great work! I'm so grateful i inspired you to make something this amazing&lt;3
---
Not as adorable as new brawl talk
---
Art thief AGAIN! Ok im exposing you now..Im done with these art thieves and reposters..My post incoming now.
---
yeah, it gets me to think that he'd be better without a voice. But I really do think he needs a voice. The one brawler that doesn't need a voice is spike. Also, thank you for the support.
---
Ngl "100 upvote and ...." is kind of annoying but nevertheless this masterpiece is amazing
---
I agree with you , but I think everyone wants a skin for him first
---
They released brawl talk about a week after they filmed them ...
---
Maybe not week
---
WTF IS THAT
---
If they add this to the game, I would do anything to get this skin
---
ara ara
---
That's like Disco Barley from GEDI KOR! It would be so good to have them in the new update since the theme is probably going to be Vapirwave/70s
---
Too relatable
---
pay attention to the spike and the crow's names
---
How i didnt notice that
---
*Did you get the star token?*
---
Yes.
---
*What did it cost?*
---
Everything.
---
I refuse to believe that this is a real match xD
---
üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

what the fuck am i looking at
---
Android and Mortis? ily
---
Why does this sound like a female anime character in my head ?
---
highly doubtful...
---
Looks like solo showdown.
---
Using his super!
---
üéµWe dont want Fraaanks on the lawn!üéµ
---
I agree. But there is a point to make about the chances of getting a legendary being too low. I'm not sure how accurate and can't remember the exact numbers, but Kairos Time did a video calculating that on average, you need more than a year of f2p BS to get all 3 legendaries. That's just BS imo.
---
No he says "oh you're so lucky"
---
all 4 of them suck on that map
---
r/tf2 is leaking
---
This design isn't my, is made by mu friend, the original desing is drawed for me, check my profile

Let's get this guy to 69 comments XD
---
K, I‚Äôm just saying, Piper is not good on the mode
---
who is the person on the right of the paper? I've never seen them before...
---
Why would you mess with a shotgunner on an energy drink map?!
---
üòÇüëè
---
nah they're all good
---
on that map?
---
Agreeable, I feel your pain Today I was playing Frank then I saw Piper and could easyly kill her buy then I started laggying and died RIP.
---
I was just waiting for the frank to unleash hell at the end. Love it
---
oh you're right, then, which line did he swear
---
ok then whats the problem with the website lol
---
It‚Äôs too hard to open menu and invite people
---
Can confirm on that title, I live in America and I‚Äôm Mortis.
---
Loaded Rico is already thicc enough just follow his lead
---
oh.
---
No problem
---
 Carl eats rocks for breakfast, lunch and diner.
---
That's why he is detecting seismic activity all the time.
---
This is Gedi_Kor tier
---
What was bull about to do to the apple...
---
#*L E G A L*
---
Spike&gt;Crow confirmed
---
I don't think he does
---
38 trophies for everyone for participating! ... ...... i actually have no authority to declare that or dole out any trophies but know that i wanted to give them to u all...
---
lol that would be a fun heist map lol maybe not for big game solid 7/10
---
It happened only because bull suddenly stopped playing
---
RIP that one Shelley that didn't make it into the train.
---
I just need new brawlers from those boxes üòÖ. I reached around 8700+ trophies, no star power, missing 5 brawlers and the boxes are pretty much useless for me. All I get is 2 power token and less than 15 coins. Well, we gotta live with that I guess
---
This is a side comic ;)
---
Its alright
---
That might be true! Thanks for rating it!
---
Hahaha dying
