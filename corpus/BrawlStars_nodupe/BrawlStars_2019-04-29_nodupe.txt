Oh i see now. Yeah I've unlocked star powers and brawlers from opening a single chest before. And that's after getting 100 boxes from the weekend events and getting absolutely nothing.

---
Nope. Rosa damage is a joke she has 1700 dps per second a t one . Frank has nearly 6K health at one. She would take at least 3 seconds and a bit more to kill him in equal level.

Considering that they are in Duo Showdown I dunno, they probably do team in solo showdown and then they get killed.

Lol like a Mad Max Carl

Beating the system, eh?

Lol I'm not complaining, those 500 trophies helped my trophy road a lot

Just random. Probably with a website that has a random name picker ya know

Yes yes I am
---
What if colt only uses ONE revolver? Hmmmmmmmmmm
---
That was the day everyone at my school was buying her and I just got home then opened one box then get that bitch
---
Mortis doesn’t need a buff a real mortis would understand that he requires something (not many people have) called skill to use

That shite is so op and break all the fun in this game!!!
---
Explanation
---
I did a pretty good clutch and when I was gonna replay and record BAM this appears to f*** my life which is annoying since even if the brawler is new and you got something. Ew you can't record because it's new and don't have enough trophies so I think it needs to be removed the minimum for the replays
---
What movie is this from
---
And the bad randoms click play again too
---
Probably make it so it leaves a crater(like brocks)
---
nah what should happen is whenever a bomb fires, her current starpower activates without destroying the mortar itself
---
Big LTE paid them to put wifi spikes in.
---
what's a buckshot?
---
Wtf I didn’t mean to post this
---
Reddit being retarded
---
Oh, duo showdown. Then I don't know.
---
Bro it’s not based on power level
---
Idiot
---
u/ryan_supercell u/frank_supercell don't worry we love u
---
Lmao
---
Did you smoke crack at the time you created it?
---
Why can not there be a character as unbalanced as that.
---
To start:
---
• She uses the super 5 to 6 consecutive times.
---
• Super loads too fast.
---
• It reduces an ABSURD amount of damage.
---
• Six seconds of time. Really?
---
• And worse than it carries the super while it is with the super already activated, which gives her an absurd advantage.
---
Seriously, it seems like you've created her lazily. I refuse to play with it.
---
In my opinion and some friends who play should make the following corrections:
---
• As long as she has the super activated, she should not charge the next one, preventing her from using the super super consecutively.
---
• Reduce the absorption of the shield to 60 to 70%.
---
• Reduce from 5 to 4 or 4.2 the duration of the super.
---
Just a few remarks I made and should be corrected.
---
Thanks for listening.
---
And I’m not pay to win. Yea I have power ten, but I’m at 9k
---
But it’s a super cell, not an ordinary cell...
---
nah man, ram best grill

I don't think supercell is against mortis lol. If Rosa is the main issue right now then its fine because she will get nerfed hard very soon.
---
Well, they are not wrong. I mean, you unlock her at 0 trophies.
---
If you’re out of her range she can’t do squat.
---
Yeah my comment was 2 days old...hours after she came out.  So idk why your even commenting lol.
---
Yeah, too OP and ez trophies, but I meant pushing with other brawlers
---
Nah, I feel a JoJo reference popping up soon.
---
It was the gem hunting one
---
What a good idea.
---
Geez, Why supercell doesn't use that ideas :(
---
lol didn’t even notice
---
I wouldn't say "destroyed by Rosa", rather "destroyed by bad playtesting".
---
If you have negative Gems, you cannot purchase anything at all that costs Gems, even things that cost 0 Gems.
---
Also... How did you get negative Gems?
---
~~Buff Crow~~ NERF ROSA!
---
Replace Nita with mortis, Nita can actually do something to the tank

thats what happened to me when i was playing rosa in brawl ball
---
wow. that hurts a lot. im just saying there is a thing called solo showdown.
---
this was exactly my team setup LOL

bruh his shield breaks
---
NEW UPDATE
---
No, why would I be jealous of someone that steals ideas without permission for karma and then proceed to act almighty?
---
With the skeleton-traps haha
---
I swear, I was running away from a rosa and I was like “??what the fuck, how can she still hit me??”
---
Pee pee poo poo
---
Yeah. I did it with witch and it spawned so many at a time. It would be a cool if a new card was a building designed to hold back a troop.
---
Smoking causes kun dance while diabetes make you buy insulin and make you go broke
---
This is why you should never, ever, auto-aim his super, it is terrible unless you know exactly where you are landing.
---
so this is a buff mortis or a nerf rosa make up your mind
---
It’s disappointing that they won’t make a skin or a voice over cuz she is literally like my favorite character to play as
---
Never thought about that
---
Looks like shit
---
Ngl I murder Bulls when they take my cube
---
But I wasn’t, I think over half of the games I showed I was Carl, 2 or 3 was with Bo, and actually I think one was Rosa, I’m currently trying to push to more trophies with Carl since he’s so low and my Bo is too
---
Look buzz a brawler thats not rosa
---
Also, it somehow protects her from showdown poison.
---
HOW
---
Matching system is very good
---
We know his Video doing the moving with only Mortis's attack was like a year ago, I was just saying he was probably trying to do the challenge
---
It’s ok, I love you anyways :)
---
“i aM tHE crEaTUrE oF tHE NiGHt!”
---
Its was an Animation from Supercell when Rosa was released
---
I had my own idea for her star power which would make her first shot when having full ammo be a bomb instead of a bag of coins and it explodes no matter what even if it doesn’t hit a target. The damage wouldn’t stack and the explosion would be a circular radius instead of a cone shape.
---
Best way to nerf her would probably be to:
---
1) Increase the amount of attacks needed to charge her super
---
2) Decrease the amount of damage mitigated to 70% (from 80%)
---
3) Decrease the amount of time her super can be active to either 4 - 5 seconds (from 6)
---
In my opinion that's what i think the best way to balance her is, she keeps her strong damage mitigation, it doesn't last for too long and you cant spam it every time you encounter an enemy, this encourages players to use her super more wisely and less spam-like. Tell me what you think
---
I didn't forget frank existed, but there is. o guarantee you will have a frank on your team or that he will have his super ready in time (same with shelly).
---
How bout we call it quicksand?
---
Nibba we losing nerf rosa

Here's a lesson if you strike out 3 times, the token ain't worken so relax and have a break, then comeback to the game and 
---
untilt your Bo with some of his stronger maps.
---
Honestly, just like hog rider
---
 Cool
---
No he did.
---
She got tired and sit down like when a boxer loses, with tired expression
---
She’s very boring to play with and against. Carl is so much of a better brawler.

rosa may be better but primo is way more fun to play as
---
It really do be like that
---
well now it does
---
Primo is just not meta any more. Glad I got him to rank 20, though.
---
Nada.
---
Great art!
---
Actually, I am on a mission. To use #BuffMortis in every post I make. Be it for Rosa or any other brawler.
---
well i deadass dont know how to respond
---
This is awesome lol
---
Auto aim has more accuracy
---
And,  Im, Mortis...
---
It was really unexpected. Mobile games are usual not the top ad in theaters. Usually it is just ads for other movies and those “turn off cell phone” scenes

Really? What theater

member when i got gene instead of carl
---
Lmao whatever you say old man
---
what
---
This post was made by 3grader gang
---
same, a little disappointed but not sure what i expected tbh
---
At power level 1, her ult gives her effectively 25k health. I think 60% mitigation (12500 health) would be much better.
---

I got 5 characters last week. One was crow. Only been playing a little over a month lol
---
Zzz these click bait title

I know there’s a flair but seriously stop
---
So you don't post them all to MAMM?
---
Dead
---
63.3% is the chance you get it at the 101th box not in those 100 boxes. Because (0.99)100 is the case that you don't get it 100 times in a row
---
Ex: if you want to get it at the 70th box and now this case is 69times not getting it in a row, then calculate (0.99)69 = 49.9% - so the 70th box will be almost 50% chance of getting it
---
A very good mention in this thread is the point where supercell should up the amount of coins that come per box because with 25 brawlers now 12 coins per box isn't enough to level up on and every F2P account has got to be plum dry on an eternal coin drought amirite?

---
Looks like a balloon
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
So I have an idea for her nerf. 
---
1.-25% damage reduction of Super ( from 80% to 60%) 
---
2. -16.6% duration of Super (from 6 seconds to 5 seconds
---
3. -33.3% Star Power healing (from 300 to 200) 
---
4. -4% Health (from 5000 to 4800) 
---
5. +33.3% punches to charge her Super (from 9 to 12) 
---
6. (more likely a rework) Can't charge super while Super is in use.
---
That's what I want but if she is still OP then make No.1 -37.5 % (from 80% to 50%)
---
How bout this... Why not make penny’s star power somewhat like Gene’s basic attack? Basically, If you’re shot reaches max distance and doesn’t hit anyone, It’ll pop into 3 gold coins and flies an extra 3 tiles, as if it hit someone
---

*GEMS*
---
Good for u, i hate how the meta changed it's rosa only
---
Oh Sorry that, I might have misrepresented it, they are actually separated ideas which only one should be done at a time. Thanks for pointing out haha,  I have now put " Which one would you choose?" in case any misleading.
---
I can't push her. It is one game and 2 mins queue before the next one
---
I honestly don't even care enough to come up with ideas.. she just needs a heavy NERF and that's it! Ever since the release I haven't been able to play a game without Rosa! Showdown is literally 9 rosa vs. me. And needles to say, whatever brawler I choose, I die! You can't kill that shit unless you're lucky. Simple as that.
---
Cut her health down to 50%, or damage down to 50%, or super down to 50%.. or even better yet, cut it all down to 50%.
---
The game is ruined otherwise.
---
What's the deal with the BO at the start of the video?

get better.

The turret is easy to counter so oof

Lol
---
How do you get this thing near you
---
She needs more nerfin than that. She's got too much damage for that much health AND she's got a super that makes her almost invincible. Fuck those 80%, might as well have been 100%. That needs to be cut down to 50% at least. And that'd be just the beginning of nerfing that shit.
---
r/MortisGang

If their colt didn’t suck, this would have been a different title.

It looks really good! One thing you could do is go over the box placements and make sure each spawn has an equal opportunity to get early boxes.

Oh, I'm planning to do more of stuff like this in the future. I'll try to make it more clear next time!
---
Deleted the game because Rosa was destroying all my games. 
---
All my games were heavily dependent on how good Rosa on each team was. 
---
I was pretty much forced into playing her since somehow I keep getting matched with power 1 Rosa. 
---
Then realized this game is pretty much trashed at this point. Deleted the game. 
---
Seriously, I would not be surprised if the testers and devs were all on ecstasy when designing her.

i didnt unlock anything but my little brother who was playing for a month got leon ......thanks brawl stars
---
Ideas:
---
* If penny hits the enemy with her main attack,the mortar damage is increased (±10% 
---
per hit ) and travel speed is reduced (-10% per hit)
---
* The mortar projectile speed increases when it hits the enemy (until ±150%,every hits increase speed by ±30%,miss reduces speed by 15%,minimal speed is the normal)
---
* the mortar stop enemies hit from healing / using super (or maybe just reducing super charge)
---
* enemies hit by penny is targeted by the mortar with a 200% projectile speed
---
“Thats a cutest fucking thing i’ve ever seen in my life”

But can Rosa be *t h i c c*?

If it's less than Gene's range, that means he was close to the turret.
---
Shiba Leon
---
Please don’t nerf Rosa, because I haven’t gotten it yet. Some players manage to get it, but some may not. If you wish to nerf, please give a notice and allow some time for players to have a chance to use it and play before the nerf. Really want to have a feel of playing Rosa. Not trying. Thanks Supercell! :)
---
Yes
---
Please also have Rosa new skin! More animation and similar to crow.
---
Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.

And where does she keep the grenades? In her butt?
---

---
Rosa really should be lower..
---
Well, speaking of which, I bought Leon with gems that I have collected (and converted back in time). I think it’s really hard to get all the legendaries only out of boxes without paying for gems.
---
Brawl stars is dead with rosa release.
---
Rosa buff redirect some of the damage star power haha
---
I’ve been playing since global and only at 5.7K. But I didn’t get a new brawler for 3 months and was stuck with 15/24 brawlers until Rosa came out and I got 4 new brawlers to push with from the boxes I saved up.
---
yes sir.
---
Gems are more expensive out of the US
---
I took me so long until i got it

Han solo dies
---
Your name gives it away lol but I want to help
---
Does not apply here at all, at ALL, even a max range max level piper hidden in bushes can only HOPE to achieve a damage output of like 520 damage per shot while Rosa is supered, which is, what, 1/5th of Rosa's HP? It's unrealistic to think a team of 3 can effectively stay out of Rosa's range for a full game, as the moment her super is charged she can chain super over and over. There, currently, is no Rosa counter, and her star power is just bananas as well, when added to her super, she is unkillable.
---
*AccurateMemin would like to know your location, and definitely not for punishment*
---
*loud fbi sounds
---
Yeah and so have I but it just feels like your chances of winning are higher with a Rosa depending on the game mode and team comps of course!
---
&gt; ~~Playing Rosa and~~ teaming in solo is next nevel pathetic
---
Fully agree.
---
I mean it wont be addressed too fast, next update shell probably be fixed but for now just grind her, thats what my friend did, lvl 1 405 trophies
---
I have Leon. 
---
Downvote me.
---
I’m free to play too, I never spent my gems on boxes or token doubler. Skins ftw baby!!
---
This.  But also all attack at once.  They were all just trying to move up the rankings like the pathetic teamers they are.
---
Well if you play like shit yes, it should happen. With her and with anyone.
---
I'm not saying she's not OP, but you had range and she doesn't. In the end, it's your fault. Except maybe close range brawlers, everyone can outplay her.
---
Tbh I think she either needs to be unable to charge her super while using it,  or have her movement speed slowed down when she’s using it.
---
That's a great idea, but think mud would make more sense
---
Yes i have it and i dont regret buying it
---
Mine is 0.2196%
---
Dude changing up some words won't hide the fact you stole the idea
---
I like it. Just work to supercell develop already and take my money doing so!
---
I bet your a non-teaming dynamike. Take my red/orange arrow pointing up! (I forgot what's its called)
---
She just needs a nerf, you don’t have to delete brawlers
---
Too scares of Rosa
---
She’s not legendary you idiot. She should at least be god-tier rarity
---
Smart, can’t walk into her range if you don’t walk at all

Colt's last questions and Piper's questions were REALLY DARK!

Or an angry Conner
---
I'll backstab cuz free elixir
---
Let me help you do the simplest math ever.
---
2 mega boxes = $9.99, 
---
170 gems = $9.99, 
---
1500 gold = $9.99
---
So normally, 2 mega boxes with 170 gems equals roughly $20. But you could buy them for the price of $4.99 so IT IS x4 value.
---
2 mega boxes, 170 gems and 1500 gold equals roughly $30. But you could buy them for $9.99 so IT IS x3 value.
---
There is nothing wrong with it.

Rosa is actually pretty easy to take down, if you can manage to keep her at a distance, and she doesn't have her super charged. It's when you can't keep her back, and/or she doesn't have her super is when you're screwed. My time playing in the latest gem grab has taught me that, being on both ends of that scenario.
---
Yes I could🤣 Anyway thanks!

Maybe its pro
---
You act like that’s hard to do
---
Pam...looks evil
---
Stop making Rosa more op
---
Ur trying really hard to reason this. It should not take that much effort to beat someone u have 10 cubes over
---
Its happened in literally hours. Idk of another game in history that has changed so quickly.
---
Mortis
---
Also- it was JUST like this when Carl came out. Brawl Stars shouldn’t allow folks to pay for the new brawler so that they are released slowly.
---
Not bad! I feel like Colt, Piper, Brock and Penny would be the best here (like a lot of Bounty maps) but Darryl would be an interesting viable choice if you add more water and squish the bushes height-wise.
---
And you have Leon...
---
For a company there is never enough money to slow down on making it. By the way they have been bought by a Chinese company. Trust me, money is their first priority. They will pull any strategy to make the most profit and retain their player base.
---
Bru have you seen super cats?
---
They got the same look as the old brawl stars and copied alot of brawler
---
nah homie this is the guy
---
You still need to play the lootbox game to get her, unless you have every character maxed.  There definitely people out there that will spend there gems on her.  Like I've said before SC does this with all there other games.  It's a long record of them doing it now.  You can't argue with that fact.
---
I saw this months ago. don’t remember who made it, but I know I saw it
---
Ah that makes sense then. Hopefully they’re not too far gone
---
hmm... i might have seen it
---
You’re the one who called me kid, kid. Your childish behavior lead to more childish behavior. Kid.
---
Очень классно
---
But she costs 19 gems or 0.19 dollar. And she is the most common rarity in tha game. If they wanted money, they would make get a leggie.
---
You can only write like so much also nobody takes the time to read it to the end😫
---
Reported
---
Any tips?
---
This needs to be on the front page, it's a fantastic idea!
---
Yeah but you could know she was above average speed before she came out. They released that
---
Yeah, but they were all Rosa, and none of them were squishy brawlers.
---
yeah bro this is the guy that made the one you saw
---
Then... Frank's zap arrives
---
🎩🤠

I checked. I can see his posts, bro this is him
---
Any tips to push Rosa?
---
I won't lie... I'm riding Rosa as hard as I can before they nerf.  She's so frickin powerful.  
---
I even killed a Bull!
---
so he posted this same one months ago? and I just magically can’t see the post?
---
Loved this skin Idea dude😍🤗
---
Why are you so old? Don't you understand the fact that spinning is never gonna stop?! Wtf are you believing man!!
---
I don't support teaming either, but if there is an op brawler ready to take you down in the 10th place, you should support teaming. At least for the time until she passes away. 
---
And about the bull shit you say, Idk what you are saying...
---
Maybe 150
---
I know😂
---
Wasn't rosa nerfed already?
---
She’s a very good brawler! I recommend her!
---
Idk man you can askhim yourself, but i'm sure that's him cause i saw his other posts
---
Yes please
---
No Ryan and frank said thats it unlimited like bunny penny they're not going off sale
---
idk about the others, but this is a repost
---
Lol...whatta about Carl’s minecart
---
#GOL
---
Well....... we found the ultimate Rosa counter........
---
HAR HAR HAR!
---
The woosher becomes the wooshed.
---
She is broken, she is one of the only brawlers that works in every mode, but she struggles without her super
---
Yeah but the best counter to rosa is well...rosa. Brawl stars is literal shit right now due to the fact that rosa is the majority of the pvp opponents, because supercell made a dumbass move by saying "Hey, Rosa is fucking OP as hell so how about we ruin the game by selling her for 19 gems?" Like that is the sole reason why rosa is everywhere. If she wasn't sold for 19 gems and you had to pull her the old fashion way, the game wouldn't be full of Rosas and it wouldn't be a problem.
---
I did this saturday but you probably made the stupid mistake of showdown, i pusjed to her to 500 on bounty, 3rd 500 brawler also one of my favorites
---
🅱️l 🅱️rimo
---
Thanks😏😉
---
He is the worst legendary right now
---
GOL GOOOOOD
---
The thing is even 40% on darryl feels like a lot, so i propose instead kf nerfing just jer 80% really hard we reduce it to 70 and decrease charge rate to 12 punches or 4 attacks, and maybe reduce movement speed to normal
---
Every club i join is always dead af in the chat
---
Me too
---
I think the little baby is getting a bit upset. You seem pretty insecure about your age too.
---
What your iPhone?
---
This is basically me stacking supers as Shelly on Rosa and her being just fine
---
Yeah let's make rosa go from strong to worst brawler in the game
---
Lol yes
---
I hope this is a joke
---
where is bull and darryl?
---
But there's nowhere to run.
---
I think Leon is at a good place atm. A slight damage upgrade from long ranged shots would be nice. But overall he works fairly well
---
The middles to open.
---
I know, id rather they start small like leon and shes still op but theyre working on it rather than just turning on the killswitch
---
What irritates me the most, is that after they fucked up they take so God damn long to fix shit. Like, it's simple, EVERY FUCKING Player is saying she's OP, so nerf her for Christ's sake
---
Nerf ASAP.
---
Also what in the hell happened to match making? I used to play competitive matches now I get complete morons for teammates every single match. I get people that don’t split on penny/Jessie attacks, run away during ganks, run up to fight with all the gems, use poco heals like it’s an attack, etc etc. 
---
I would pay for a premium version where there are no idiots playing....also we need post game stats (maybe use that to develop match making)
---
It’s nerf or Ryan saying “that if the brawl stars youtube channel get more subscribers they will nerf Rosa”
---
Because I want and it is special for me
---
Unfortunately, this thing is stuck in a dimension that nobody ever visits nowadays
---
F
---
That’s damn high, mine is 0,0096% since i got crow
---
Learn the box names
---
All jokes aside, this is ridiculous. With the amount of play testing supercell does they definitely should have seen how absurdly broken she was and done something about it. She makes the game so much less fun
---
Itd be better if it was a snow shovel he threw
---
.... 9.1k without even a mythic, you're complaining way too early.
---
Imo Frank or Tara stunning her is the best I've found, without charging up her super( her op bit)
---
You probably don’t buy token doublers
---
Heh... thats nothingni got mine to 420 in one day WHILE LVL 2
---
Did some1 call me?
---
Do you buy token doublers?
---
Just need a brawler that does damage by a percent of the enemy's hp. Perhaps just .5% at power 1 and up to 1% at power 9. Also the super can split the enemy's current hp in half in an aoe but can not kill.
---
Super does not need to scale with power if Rosa's doesn't either
---
Bro i don't play that much
---
Brawl stats
---
I think the 200 is ok. Yes i know its annoying when you want to play but everything you get is -10 trophies in siege but it would give you too many boxes if you could rise it up to 1000 (i think 250-350 would be good amount that would not give everybody too much boxes)
---
More like symmetra before rework
---
Brawl stats  if you want it   search for a kairos time tutorial on youtube

"No internal testing can replace players feedback"
---
Ofc they care about balance or else why tf would they do balance changes every update? Huh?

They need us players give them feedback to do so

You:Buff Leon
---
Supercell:make rosa super buffed?
---
Everyone:nononononon
---
Supercell:dome!
---
Smh my head
---
Idk what you're talking about. Leon is perfectly fine. At higher levels he can out put 6k damage extremely fast, with a super that allows his to get close to everyone without them even knowing. Star power makes it 10x easier as well.
---
 Leon isn't underpoweres buddy.
---
Is this rosemary font?
---
Same- I think Brawl TV is having a bad influence on new players. Ugh🤦‍♂️
---
That's me waiting for my Legendary
---
Supercell:what?Buff rosa?weird but here
---
This hurts, the flashbacks are too much
---
Rosa has seriously hurt my enjoyment of the game. Every showdown is just a game of running away from one Rosa until you run into another and die.

---
As I said earlier if I go a bit further the invisibility will end early ( that is if I go out of their sight range ) and if I went invisible closer to them so that the invisibility will last longer they will see me get invisible thus they will start shooting and runnung away
---
We need this. It's our only chance.
---
As a spaniard that I am reading "an el primo" hurt like hell
---
I realized she was OP when I solo'd a tower in siege. I don't play her much because it gets boring just pub stomping people. Plus Genie is super fun.
---
Obviously fake
---
Ya well she didn’t have her super
---
Or not
---
Lol thats how animations work. You might be thinking CGI or something
---
I stop at like 96
---
At least this was fun. All Rosa is boring
---
Looks about right
---
I can't even tell whose animation this is... Brock?
---
Shit I LOVE it!
---
**OOOOOH YESSSS**
---
Neta can back peddle and kill her at max range. The problem comes in when all three people on a team are attacking her and somehow she stays on 1 hp and lives.
---
Still, fps is way too slow to be an animation. It lacks a plot to be considered one, and if it wasn’t looping, it’d be less than 1 second long. Everyone has their own opnions, and i dont think this would be considered an animation
---
The solution is seasons where your trophies reset, but you have a lifetime trophy amount outside of the seasons.
---
Her bear is also doing it.
---
Cuz he is will smith smh
---
.
---
You should be defensive in heist tho
---
pff, auto correct.

Not limited = permanent you moron

yes. YES! YYEEEEAAAAAAAAAAASS!

not symmetrical, try again
---
yeah, i meant that guy that just stays there at the very start
---
What at else are you supposed to do let her kill you lol
---
I kinda like this idea but I got like 10 gems
---
are you like actually disappointed

Use the exponent symbol: \^

And I wonder why everyone hated island invasion /s
---
That’s proof of bad teammates.
---
Yes. I’m ftp
---
So
---
SO I CANT HAVE IT
---
You need to attack once before supering again
---
You can use it
---
It seems every person below in my clan have multiple epics and mythics despite them being f2p.
---
Ofc we need skin for Leon
---
Shelly is op also, the real problem here is chain supering people, plz stop with the chain supers supercell!
---
Your stolen
---
But she really does need a nerf
---
i think you meant shot gunners heaven
---
I don't wanna start a dumb argument, so all I'm gonna say is that getting offended JUST for seeing the word might be a little extreme, don't you think? Yeah, it does have history, but so do most of other racial slurs. Literally. So saying that some of them are ok and some aren't is pretty hypocritical.

I am. And apparently, the following character ' is the reason it didn' t work.

it's likely concept or scaling. Typically when you do gem things in clash of clans it's exponentially better to do it over a certain time period and at the deep end. For example, Gemming one of my upgrades with 10 hours left is just over 100 gems while a 7 day upgrade is just shy of 1,000.

---
Yeah if she were slower it would be harder for her to superstack since she would have to be really close starting out to get enough damage and it would fix her in brawl ball
---
Seriously, bots are dumb
---
If they had a brawler that can jump in the walls and defenders had no throwers, it would be automatic game over lmao.
---
That’s because she’s S tier in literally every game mode
---
Even then your teammates can distract them even a little bit and allow you to walk through.
