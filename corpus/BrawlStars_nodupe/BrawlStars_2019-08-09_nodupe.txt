Wait do you hope people don't realize that's old siege or why are you posting it now here?

Yes, thank you! I mean you can be older then 15 and play brawl stars so ‚Äúadult humor‚Äù should not get this hate just ignore it or (I don‚Äôt want to say grow up) but sometime the time will come when this kind of free speech will be natural
---
Where's my boy Tick :(
---
Probably not tbh.  Supercell games are built to be relevant for several years,  and CoC proves that they can do that with their games.  CoC is 7 years old and is still their most relevant game.  It also still has 14M YT subscribers.  Brawl Stars may not be as relevant 7 years from now, but it won‚Äôt be close to dead.
---

---
That‚Äôs also why Supercell kills so many games.  They wanna make sure that they last.

---
I figured you were shelving him, but it still keeps your league down making other trophies easier.
---
The new system gives mediocre trophy road one-time rewards and expires a ton of trophies every week so it makes more sense to shelve most of your brawlers than it does to play them all.

Well how are you supposed to know that, that cannon had the starpower. That bo was probably on a trophy level, where like 95% of brawlers aren't on lvl 10 so he likely wasn't expecting it.

I remember that first one I did, that was a good one. I‚Äôm being honest, originally I was going to ditch being Mike once I unlock Leon (I have always wanted Leon), but now I have gave Mike a character; An old, kind hearted man who defies the norm of other Mikes and has his own personality, I feel in love with my own creation in away. I have been inspired to play more Dynamike; get to rank 20 and above, learn how to master Dyna-Jump, maybe one day get advice from the great Lukiebear, etc. I hope one day that if Supercell made a ‚ÄúBrawl-a-Rama‚Äù show, that at least one thing I gave Dynamike would be in the show.

I should there will be more coming

Then why? He's already suffer in Solo Showdown, why would you want him to be removed from the game?
---
Can u elaborate on what exactly I mean by team name plz?
---
Or more like with 30% already reducted, you take 70% of the damage, and with 70% extra reduction, you take 30% of that 70%, which is 21% of the damage, also known as an 89% damage reduction. This means that Rosa essentially has ~63000 health, what a nightmare
---
Guys I'm shaking. Im Fucking shaking. I never wanted to play a game as much as BRAWL STARS. That fantastic ui. That perfect, fast-paced gameplay. The character designing quality of a literal god. It honestly fucking hurts knowing I'll never see another game like this again, play it for the first time, and feel the great gamer sensation. I'll do anything to get some gems. ANYTHING. And the fact that I'm free to play is too much to bear. Why would supercede make something so perfect? To tangilize us? To laugh in our faces? Honestly guys I can't anymore. Fucking good game. But you know what? You never played TUBER simulator? Pffffffft. You know it's, fun, right? I'm not supposed to give my opinion, but give it a try. And then you can tell me if it's good or not. Not convinced yet? I'll cut you a deal. the game is available for free! And that's a great price!

The only way to stop teaming is to not team yourself, so when you say you only team because you "have to", you are part of the problem and are only making it worse.

Map link: https://crux.page.link/tHuY (Please like the map if you do like it)
---
Avenge the fallen brawlers(skulls) by pitting yourself against others! The risky diagonal paths have many power cubes but there are safe paths beside diagonals with no power cubes.
---
  At the start of the match, there is heavy contest between 2 or 3 brawlers(Depending on spawn locations) to enter the diagonals of the map for the power cubes. There are skulls forming an arrow to lead you to the diagonals. The entry of diagonals and safe path bushes are also blocked by skulls so brawlers can tell when an area is breached.
---
 As the map closes up from the poison gas, ranged brawlers can still maintain distance from close ranged brawlers in the diagonals by positioning themselves in the center, so I hope that more brawlers will be viable on the map. At the center of the map, close ranged brawlers and ranged brawlers are able to do damage to each other in between the water areas.

Appreciate any feedback!

Says a noob shelly player. And you are honestly so braindead, my friend...His dps is THE STRONGEST out of the close range brawler. Do you know how easy it is to kill a shlly with darryl? And el primo too. He is designed to be an assasin, that means he can yse his super and can kill ANY long range brawler. Can shelly do that? No. Can bull do that? No. Can el primo do that? NO. Because anyone with a brain would keep his range against a bull/shelly/el primo. But darryl can come close to them and kill them. Once again saying, shelly is only good with band aid, otherwise she is one of the weakest brawlers because she gets countered really easily. Same with bull. And darryl has a lot more potential and he is a really strong brawler in both casual and competitive, with or without star power. Done. Dont call darryl the weakest brawler, while your flair is basically a trash brawler without star power.

---
I dont agree with that. Shelly and bull are just overrated. Thats why. Darryl is stronger than shelly and bull in any way. I kill shellies and el primos so easy with darryl. And also he has a potential to kill any long-mid range brawler with his super, while shelly and bull cant.
---
The guy has Leo(n) in his name that's surely a sign!
---
True. Shelly is only good with band aid. I kill shellies without band aid so easy with darryl.

People use to send video clips to these people, but when this guy gets a video clip from Reddit (in this case), he should at least put some credits in description (I'm not really sure if he does). 
---
Also, maybe, it doesn't necessarily means this guy steals it, he might received a message from another person (not the owner's video) who said: "Hey, I got this, can you get it on a video?" But the YouTube guy doesn't even know if the video belongs to this person. I don't think we can do much about it. They can't really be sure about if a video belongs to someone or if it is "stolen".
---
Yeah some mortises are braindead but some are skillful enough to kill a leon :)
---
What do you think about it, by the way?

He credits the name, not the ‚Äúu/username‚Äù

I made another showdown map in the past called ‚ÄúFlooded Oasis‚Äù, and since people seemed to like it, I decided to make another showdown map, ‚ÄúThe Stadium‚Äù.
---
I‚Äôve always wanted to make a map inspired by a stadium where brawlers would be able to watch each other battle. The walls and bushes which form sorta a ‚Äúcircular‚Äù shape are supposed to represent the seats and the open middle is to represent the area where the brawlers fight.
---
This map was mainly made for sharpshooters, with the open middle and lanes, but throwers and tanks can also be viable with the many walls and bushes. 
---
Hate is not appreciated but constructive criticism is, if you don‚Äôt like a certain part about the map, instead of saying it sucks why not say why you don‚Äôt like the part of the map and how to improve it :3

I totally feel ya, I got to 13K without Tara and the Legies and now im really mad at the game and I have quit.

May be play less frequently, what i see is people who pushed their trophies really hard didn‚Äôt have many brawlers but the one who played 2-3 days per week got nearly every brawler. Pushing trophy doesn‚Äôt get u more boxes so when u are trying to get mega boxes, slowdown a little bit, more normal and big boxes u open between trophy road reward would definitely help u increase chance of getting legendary .

---
7k with 17 brawlers, only 1 epic, feel sad :/
---
It is definitely worth it, it's an awesome deal!
---
its been like that since we waited for the tick brawl talk
---
I mean thats true. But i rather not call ot a strategy because i call it being an asshole

Wait... I think I know you...

I can make leon which has used super
---
fair enough
---
Thanks for checking and confirming :)
---
No, she doesnt if your good. Only noobs get sniped down by pipers XD.
---
I think you should just slow her super charge speed
---
petition to make shellys super do half the damage
---
Plus that that needs to happen i agree
---
Now make Tara with uno
---
Its stolen
---
Lmao I went a bit overboard with the emojis
---
It even said match over!
---
They were idiots lol
---
Is it possible to learn this power? This is amazing
---
Bro I have 13k trophies without any mythic, and just one legendary: Spike
---
Actually is 2 teams left
---
Also, Shelly's teammate just defeated
---
r/crowgang will remember that

This derserves to be in the Animation. Possibly my favourite fanart here

I don't hate but srsly, having all brawlers at 6k shouldn't make ANYONE proud at all.

Thats me b4 trophy inflation

No

thank you for participating! :)

Have a nice day!
---
I'm on 11k trophies and have 23/27 brawlers. The struggle is real. I'll never forget the day I got spike though... I just want one more legendary..
---
My idea is that penny, colt, and Jessie are children of Pam and another mystery character, most likely a Pirate, and all of them inherited their special gifts!
---
Colt got the Pirates charisma,
---
Jessie got Pam‚Äôs engineering skills,
---
and Penny got the Pirates love for plundering AND Pam‚Äôs building skills (hence her mortar)

Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.

1k upvotes nice!

Maybe you just outskill them ;)

Im not proud

why tho.
---
Don't worry, you will receive one very soon.... I got leon at 0.1495. then got frank then got pam and then got piper(last epic) and now my chances are 0.0768
---
Thats just over 300 skins
---
He's better than mortis
---
Sad f2p noise

This is irrelevant since im at 11k no legendaries

nice distractions to your enemies by dancing!

New players? But you have 9k aren't you also a pretty new player?

Do colt

I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks Colt and Jessie could be siblings &lt;3 
---
That's a nice backstory you got there too!
---
thank you so so much!
---
Yeah there‚Äôs no denying that the best players are VERY talented, and there‚Äôs a lot to learn/master to become good at the game but the developers balance it from the bottom up so kind of ruins it

I hope he will be banned.

im sorry i dont have reddit

Maybe y'all ppl should remember when YOU guys were 9 and 10 yo everyone is immature when you ar young and if i ask me, thats fine

But as u age, you shouldn't act same as other 9 yo instead deal with them MATURELY which i believe some 15 yo don't know how to do

9k.is.not.a.milestone.

I'm a poco main. But there's no flair for him. I got crow at 1k out of a box and got bored of him

what can supercell do about teammates that are bad ? lol , just dont play with randoms and quit whining
---
Go and see my arts, its not working
---
He is a f*cking art thief
---
Brawl stars is not that p2w bc even if you didn't max out your brawlers you could still get them to 300+ (if you're good)

Thank man.

Damn he no pants

Its hard to hit all your shots, but at that range at least one bullet should have hit
---
Lol when playing throwers just play mid
---
it's uncommon but it happens a lot in gem grab clips
---
I know what you mean and i'm very happy to see people like you that support artists, i've see so many cases of friends having they art stolen on a more agressive way (like peple really selling they art on t-shirts, etc). My response was a joke because i can't resist, sorry. I don't wanted to be rude, english is not my native language and i'm sorry if my writing make you fell that way.
---
And yeah, my reddit are my nickname on games, my insta are my nickname on real world and where I post some arts, it's a little abandoned but i plan to come back with more brawl stars art

Thank you and sorry for anything

170 gem offer is cheaper

play brawball

then dont play with randoms.  and btw if you play with randoms , then you yourself are a random and just as bad as the others
---
#lon
---
Cool
---
Report button.that all i need
---
The other guy saying to wait foe mega boxes is trolling. Those are the worst value.   
---
This is 42.44 tokens per gem spent(obviously you have to get 32 per ticket). This might be the highest value token per gem I have seen. The 1400 token doubler for 39 was only 35.89 tokens per gem.   
---
It's basically two mega boxes for 49 gems.
---
This is could make up for a nice theory 
---
Good art btw
---
It also comes with enough power points to get to power 5 so this is a really good deal
---
You must be a noob
---
That's scary me
---
lol, those skins already exist in the game
---
Im F2P and i have Leon and Spike
---
Yeah! I was really hoping I‚Äôd get him and somehow it worked I guess

Thanks :)

There isnt a poco flair? Rip didnt know

Have you got one since robo spike?

Well that wasnt related to my question

what was your trophies with primo before tilting ?

Says the 8k
---
Supercell is.

#c r u e l
---
He's asking and maybe he's new to the game so he doesn't know there is a skin like this?

Want to add a creative mode to brawl stars and super cool senario elements to

Depends on the trophy lvl or maybe not any more.

Nto fnuny dind't lauhg

U have 1k trophies -_-?
---
I was teaming with a mortis and i was a dinamike and mortis let me win.
---
Show me a mega box offer with a higher token per gem ratio. This is 2080 tokens for 49 gems, over two mega boxes worth of boxes for 49 gems you aren't getting that value in a mega box offer.  
---
I'm honestly curious if we have ever seen a better since global.
---
i appreciate the effort
---
Maybe because the Nita is in the same group as the shelly
---
30 years old here. I expected the majority of the players of a game such as this, mobile game with micro transactions, would be mostly adults. Came here to this subreddit and I'm so fuckin disappointed. The increasing amount of cringeworthy comments and posts is killing me softly

It came out alongside movies like How To Train Your Dragon and Despicable Me. If it weren't overshadowed by others, it could easily have been one of the most memorable animated movies around.

Answer me you bastard!

My legendary chance is 0.0112 lmao, I‚Äôm not getting a legendary for a long time

i think if they have an inappropriate name the game change it to bot or a brawler‚Äôs name
---
DARN IT! I've already SEEN THIS MEME! Try harder next time buddy! Aha!
---
That has nothing to do with supercell and your currency. Just because 20 dollars are a lot for a game for you it doesn't mean that supercell should make it cheaper.
---
look at ANY tweet that includes fortnite and another game even if its minesweeper and the whole reply section will be like "ew how do people play that trash its a bad kid's game fortnite is obviously better" trust me i've looked at a few and the majority of people in the community that know how to communicate with others are like that.
---
Lol gemmer
---
a maxed Brock can't even 2 shot a level 7 piper unless you take incendiary damage into consideration.

it may be a hint of a new skin;)

They should‚Äôve just played showdown.

This man is a part of the hivemind!

I don't know whether to downvote or upvote this
---
What did you expect from a F2P game?
---
I know but it's not a joke anymore. It's a shitty circlejerk. There was a kid that suicided (or was about to) just because he didnt like minecraft and keanu reeves. It's the same shit with fortnite. Imagine if someone suicides just because people keep offending them because they enjoy playing another game. Such people should be banned.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs because I was on my mini account üòÜ

i used to play like that so everyone can watch back in beta

Oh hell no

uh ok good job i guess

Stop spamming

Guys im shaking im fucking shaking i never wanted to breed with anyone more than i want with this cat
---
My question to Ash, why do you  teaming? we caught you in subreddit
---
Getting trophies =/= Winning
---
Winning a match = Winning
---
If you pay to max out brawlers then you are more likely to win since you have stronger brawlers
---
Fortnite isn't P2W since cosmetics are the only purchasable items in the game
---
See the difference?
---
band-aids
---
________149rd________

old brawl stars theme
---
No, the prices are not the same. Prices work by tier, and those are much cheaper in India and China if I remember correctly
---
U gotta stop playing now
---
Now I need to play this
---
I love Soul knight.
---
The wizard's upgraded new power is so fun to use
---
It‚Äôs happened to me twice. Both times we almost won the game but ended up losing.
---
Glad you finally got the attention you deservedüòå
---
I dont like fisherman so i wouldnt buy it
---
Everyone has different views for money about games, for me it's not that much but not a little either. I'm f2p too so it doesn't matter. Some people want to support supercell more and want more and expensive IAPs.
---
No, Frustration: Yes, Hotel: Trivago

Darryl's second star power on piper
---
The offer worth it, i bought Leon when he was 549 gems

Then don't.

I'd like to see her second star power throw bombs on takeoff and landing
---
The moment that the one mike hit like three of them with his super lmao
---
Someone should really make a brawl stars meme format of that meme lol
---
I agree 100%. Glad we could come to an agreement.

But they don't get the refund, and that's all.

If i should delete brawler stars because it only makes me mad Or sad

It‚Äôs worth. I had 12700 trophies and no legendary. I bought Leon

Why is this so upvoted? There is a watermark and it's supposed to be rectangles with points

Hyper bear is quite good in hiest it can turn the tables at times when you are about to lose so it not that bad it depends on the game mode.

Stop teaming. Its called SOLO showdown for a reason.

And then there is me with shelly at 600 trophies with band-aid.
---
Or the bibi from the other team that got away from the IKE instead of punching it one more time.

Here what i really think needs to be added asap

Jessie - Shot speed up (don't know how much)

Darryl- Unload speed up
---
Piper- A little bit more damage close range
---
Thats impossible. About 20 YEARS

Oh my god ur soooooo dumb

70 % OF THESE ARE EXTREMELY OVERPOWERED IDIOT LEAVE NOW NEVER RETURN

I played against y‚Äôall on duos one game while on brawl tv! Congrats!

thats not the point. the original comment said that gems are overpriced in their country and to just change the settings but that doesn‚Äôt make sense.

So, People like him is what makes supercell games free.

I read it as Leon Dance Brock until I checked it again

Shelly spam for the win

wow thats even before landscape

I like Fortnite and brawlstars; both are good. One doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be good and the other bad that is very close minded
---
El primo be looking like one of the employees from scp 3008
---
Bear with me in every gamemode except heist. When hyper bear is on the safe the percentage goes down crazy fast. But when you can keep the bear alive longer it's more valuable so bear with me
---
They just need get rid of it on her. Give it to frank. And have shelly get the 1000 health boost.
---
How many trophies do you have?
---
or 60,825,600,000 milliseconds
---
I agree
---
Guys I'm shaking bcuz you guys like boys
---
DO NOT TEAM please, teaming ruined showdown for me and other people and if the only options are team and die then die because teaming is not a deserved win and if most people stop teaming the ones that didn‚Äôt won‚Äôt have a lot of players to team up with so teaming will be insanely reduced
---
how do ya BECOME a creator.
---
This movie deserves more recognition
---
listen bro
---
im not holding anything against ya
---
chill :)
---
Wat?
---
He‚Äôs most likely put a lot of money into Brawl as I have. I‚Äôm at 8.5K and just bought Leon as my last. I love the gameplay but above all I love having options, so unlocking all toons as quickly and feasibly as possible is the route I went. Probably about $150-$200 in total.

Got all but Leon at 9k
---
I hear gold star when he says that and I hear camila cabello blabbered when gene says his first word in showdown or whenever he starts a match
---
Lord, forgive me what i'm about to do
---
He is not better than a Shelly with bandaid. I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt be good at Darryl, but he‚Äôs weaker than most brawlers in that he has trouble staying alive. His shield starpower definitely helps with that, but he is ***not*** better than bandaid Shelly.

People will never be satisfied with a mobile game reliant on updates. It is simply the nature of this world.

I know but for example, when shellys bandaid already activated (when she doesnt have bandaid). Darryl can deal outplay her if he is smart.
---
I think he died
---
Exposed: It was a tie.
---
So it‚Äôs the feeling of being a Silver Medalist. Excellent, but never enough.
---
?
---
lets be honest here. both kinda are.
---
Yep pretty much
---
Dont bother all those copypastas comment are gonna ruin your art
---
 That perfect, curvy body. Those bountiful breasts. The teenager bearing  hips of a literal goddess. It honestly fucking hurts knowing that I'll  never mate with her, pass my genes through her, and have her birth a set  of perfect offspring. I'd do fucking ANYTHING for the chance to get  Bibi pregnant. A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that I can't is quite  honestly too much to fucking bear. Why would Supercell create something  so perfect? To fucking tantalize us? Fucking laugh in our faces?!  Honestly guys, I just fucking can't anymore. Fuck.

You‚Äôre asking a stupid, rhetorical question. Games like Brawl Stars that have no ads rely solely on in game app purchases to make profit. By saying ‚Äòyou guys really pay for a mobile phone game?‚Äô Makes it sound like its inhumane and wrong to do so. Stop. Quit your bullshit and let the people spend what their money on whatever they want.

Her stats aren't what made her broken, it's bandaid. They have absolutely no reason to nerf the stats

Anyone else think 8/16 is the brawl talk?

Didn‚Äôt funny not laugh

Fuck everything else

Sorry, what does 'stats' mean?

600 but without bandaid
---
But also try to look were things can improve. Lol
---
Why is this so accurate.
---
Im losing to the boss pls nerf
---
Oof it happened

Also keep in mind that even without band-aid, she is far from the worst brawler in the game, and that's mainly because of her super. It does over 2x as much damage as her normal attack, not to mention it also stuns and slows down with her star power, making her counter people like Frank and Bibi very easily. Also the fact she can chain her super makes her literally unbeatable if you get to her at point blank range

Wishing you the best of luck mate!

If you know how to play Dynamike he becomes one of the best brawlers in the game. With his current damage he can 2 shot squishies like Barley and Piper, and 3 shot others like Carl, Bibi, Leon, Jessie, Nita, and more. While he isn't skilless, anybody who remotley knows how to play him can be extremely dangerous. Also no one would pick Barley over him because he still has more health and their supers work completely differently.

unplayable

Exactly, it‚Äôs actually great that Supercell never listens to all the players supporting this hahaha
---
Why do people always calculate that wrong ? The doublers give you 80 boxes on top of the 80 you normaly get. That said it' 40 days of progress compared to a brawler that has a 0.xxxxx chance.
---
As a fellow blender user, nice background at least!
---
500 is the best

‚ÄúMy friends gems glitched‚Äù I‚Äôm explaining that refunding gems is the only way for this to happen.
