try saving boxes in the beginning of the season and opening at the end. saving too much will make your progress slow

Messing with the Chungis causes him to stealthily sit on you after going invisible

I'm at 5.7k and i have all epics, mortis and crow lol
---
Old mike
---
Jesus I’m only 4600 and I have Leon and Tara 20/24 brawlets
---
Yeah fair fair I’m just messing around 
---
yeah we could easily beat you.... mwhaahahh asian reverse card
---
Ok?
---
No, it has to find you teammates and enemies with the same trophy count as the brawler your playing with. For example : you picked a 50 trophy shelly. The people you will be playing with will have a trophy count of 50 (or almost 50)
---

---
Bruh... she forgot to practice her spanish... _**HE'S**_ coming...
---
I think hitspeed would be more balanced at 2  seconds. She would be op on defense with 1 second. 
---
I feel like bull, shelly or leon should be there instead of jessie - they NEVER team. Ever.
---
better than mine 
---
I only spent 10.98€, so... Am I pay to win? 😂
---
Nice, I got all 3 epics within the same week, 2 of which I got in the same day (Frank and piper)
---
Carefully, he‘s a hero.
---
Very true
---
😂😂😂
---
Nice :D how many trophies ?
---
Nice 
---
Absolutely not needed.
---
He want the butsek 
---
Haha wp :D 
---
Just like Ash and his son!
---
Wdym first released he has always been in the game
---
Yeah, she has a bandit skin too
---
Yeah It's okay ^^ Hope you'll get some more :p
---
wait for spike. 
---
Wanna end the game faster, and mhm if its my girlfriend, im already suicidal so yeah i would then
---
Noobs play SD real men play 3v3s

I played a match with my 501 ricp and got matched with 300 crow

geeezus mother of pearl your art skills are godly and should only be seen by virgin eyes,, OP you have truly surpassed Picasso! Here is my upvote
---
Still remain
---
This is actually a really good idea! Great job!
---
Hey. Sei italiano da queste parti ?
---
* G E N E *
---
Next update looking funky
---
yeah I'm saying, based on the comments and your title, everyone thinks this is some god tier anti teamer play, and I understand that teaming is almost impossible to ignore if you want to gain trophies, but if you hate a system, don't support because the system leads to personal gain
---
Well, I’d be lying if I were to say this hasn’t been me.
---
Wow someone is salty they’re bad at the game lol. Play a different game mode then, quit crying about teaming, it’s so old. It’s been a thing since the inception of the game, it’s a part of the showdown experience. Get over it or go play Hay Day 🙂
---
How cute!
---
A strategy is a plan of action or policy designed to achieve a major or overall aim. Spinning to form a team is the plan of action. Getting 1st place is the goal. Therefore, teaming is a strategy 
---
It sometimes happen when your charging your phone or maybe too much memory in your phone maybe you have been playing way too much.
---
Finally, someone of sense came up with a buff idea.
---
I'm a dataminer and I can confirm this will be added in the next update.
---
You missed something
---
I would rather it be normal rewards 
---
Teamers: That Frank is a Spy!
---
That's not what I mean, what I tried to say is, because someone else does it, does not free you from gilt from doing the same, I've won a ton of matches that I though they were lost for sure, I don't mind if you do it on siege or similar if the enemy team is destroying the objective and there is no chance of coming back, in the other hand, if you just rage quit mid match or in the last minute, basically turning the match into a 2vs3, you're an asshole (at least thats what I think it's OP's point) 
---
I agree. This was a job well done.
---
I’m preeeeetty sure you’re on the wrong sub pal
---
Good job bro 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
---
Who cares if you do it in a full party, or with ramdoms if the rest of the team agrees? 
---
Thanks for making this even more hilarious. 
---
Haha true
---
Combined I probably have more than 2000 wins in showdown lol, It’s not that I can’t handle teaming or that I would be struggling with gaining trophies, I’m quite aware how showdown works and what not. But imagine if teaming wasn’t a thing, if it would truely rely on how good YOU are personally, that’s what I would WANT to see in solo showdown, it’s literally in the darn name, ”solo”.
---
Me: destroys a cactus using super
---
Spike: .o.
---
Yeah I’m really lucky I also got piper a few hours before him

As the creator of island invasion, I can confirm this only has a slight resemblance and therefore should be named something else.
---
The bush around the whole map was supposed to a bush patrol where you don’t know where an enemy is. It was also made so that after a while bull and Shelly will become less viable as the map opens up.
---
Here you turned it into island invasion after a flood, so that the big bushes are literally useless unless you want to camp for 5 minutes, but nobody is gonna be so stupid as to walk in there.
---
Island invasion was never supposed to be a balanced map for brawlers of all shapes and sizes, and it was also originally made for duo showdown.

First of all, Im from Mexico. I play a lot of Brawl Stars but nthing like this has happened before. I have played more than 10 games in a row that in which the match making has paired us with Asians. We are currently playing in Asian servers which causes many problems as delay in general, and many lag. We tried to return to our original location but nothing changed. Please help, is not fun to play 30 seconds in the past...
---
how did you do that?
---
You think this what they came up with this just to stop teamers? Hope that the case and there just testing
---
Piper will be scrap if this is true 😐
---
Removed. Rule 3. No providing information on how to break Supercell Terms of Service.

Nice jukes! Looked a little dumb when u wasted super tho😂😂
---
It’s really not too much of an advantage in this game. The people that lost either had a worse comp of players or just suck and want to pass the blame.
---
ок 
---
exactly
---
thanks
---
If you cant accept criticism then dont make maps
---
I will be soon
---
Well excuse me if I wanted to include that extra fact.

If that's not good then what are my artworks

Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL

First off, not everyone plays mobile games just to kill time. Just because it is a mobile game doesnt mean it should have lower standards. Also with matchmaking they said they added player pools so that you wouldnt only get matched with people that have the same trophies of the brawler you are playing but the same amount of general trophies. Yet as a 12,000 trophy player i get teamed with 3,000 trophy players.
---
congrats man! how did you like her new slow effect. pretty handy right?

I only had to max out my credit card 18 times

Wouldn't this encourage teaming since u can't autoaim ur teammates?
---
Brawl star Fortnite dances would be the end of the world
---
I will Shelly will lose against any brawler

I’ll have pam

So basically, implementing this feature has no drawbacks.. only the stigma of the so called “p2w” ... only at low trophies as you said.

Nvm, sorry, just saw all the reposts, my wifi sucks, and when I clicked post, nothing happened. Sorry.
---
brock says "youre so lucky" when he dies
---
I hope they add something similar to this!
---
U think siege is better than gem grab
---
if u nerf pam i quit
---
I mean it’s either do this or get killed by the higher powered player and the goal is to win so 🤷‍♀️
---
It also depends on the amount of times they spin I think :)
---
I like your art style
---
I love that tweak
---
Are you GEDI, but on another account?
---
Sorry for the repost. My wifi was down, and when I pressed post, nothing happened, so I just spammed post. Really sorry about that.
---
So basically you spun, betrayed, died, and then posted on reddit to act like you're a hero. what a lad.

I just really dislike Gem Grab, siege can be tolerable.

No, het maybe some cloud storage. Skins are overrated. My nephew is hooked to fortnite and has 50+ skins and 400,- of his parents money in it. Regrets when he stops playing.

SO MANY SNIPER LOL
---
Siege is a waste of space. Brawl ball should be permanent!
---
I didn't know it was sarcasm. Oops!!
---
It's just pretty boring now, people might enjoy it but this is just my opinion and a lot of people I know. The support for F2P players in the game isn't very high either and Brawl Stars is more friendly. In 1v1 modes there is pretty much only a certain deck you can use because of its really demanding meta which is less prevalent on brawl stars. 
---
F
---
You are lucky..i dont even get a single cake for my birthday
---
* random one sided bolt spawns are unfair, especially when 1 bolt could be the difference of winning and losing 
---
* the last siege should convert the bolts of the losing team into something (health / damage increase for the Ike should be good)
---
* penny mortar shouldnt be able to outrange the Ike
---
What about Frank lol
---
Nah, he is glass cannon lol, you realize that most brawlers with long range and high damage all have low hp, below 4000
---
The field of view is so bad. . .
---
yessss!
---
Shouldn't he be landing on his elbow?
---
JK...
---
I have a second account made just for fun. And my main is mainly for pushing trophies.
---
Haha I enjoy him. Despite the low HP, versatile, great damage... it's hard to say which is the best, some is good on that mode/map, some on anothers.
---
Good job /we are going to win this time = team

The fact that there is no outplay is your fault. And your "lower age" users make no sense.
---
If you die to a bull or shelly then it's because you went into a bush without checking.
---
Lower age users? You mean adults can react to an enemy, look where he is, aim and shoot in less than half a second? Heck, children have better reactions than adults because of reasons I hope are obvious to you.
---
So cool
---
2017
---
Kidding me? First you say im suck, after this, pro, pros, pro... Now that bullshit question. What about you? A developer hidden on any profile? Gamers are around there, but you are still here. The question, talk about it, Spike and Crow, no more the last, the penultimate HP grid? 2.8k of HP base. Is it much for them? I think could be 3.0k. Dynamike has 2.8k of base. And that Legendaries with 2.4k? Sincerely: It's need to be balanced. I'm saying buff on the post title, but it's balancing. Spike and Crow need to have HP base increased and this is balancing.

So what if s lol 1 brawler killed a lvl 9 brawler?it's not that hard

It's a good idea no?

Yeah I had this idea before. It gives you a reason to push past 500. I like the token idea aswell.

No problem Mr. Gamebreaker

dirty teamer, no one wants to see a win that you needed to team to get

I like the idea a lot it looks like it would be viable for a lot of brawlers (:

FBI open the door!!

You're right, it's not a strategy.

_It's a lifestyle choice._

thx

Yes 🌝
---
I'm going to do it, just wait...
---
Agreed. I personally dislike the game for some of your reasons, and also, how low-skill cap the game can be. Auto-Aim is a thing. Tons of low-skill brawlers. People in random are trash because they rely on a button. I like Clash Royale waaaaaaaaaaaay more. I feel like I get better every day, but in Brawl Stars, I can’t chalk down, “killed by teamers” as a way to improve. It’s stupid and I’m starting to really hate the game

Before the game realeases, u can get any brawler with 0 tropies, in that account I have Dynamike and Bo with 1200 trophies hahahaha

You got me there, not gonna lie

Muchas gracias bro :)

This is not clash royale, moron

Yes u did

tell me why?

Did the tilt happen already?!?!

hahah thx
---
How do you get a brawler name and icon next to you. I want Spike, my green champion.
---
I’m gonna be the lame guy here, you shouldn’t have won. The match over announcement was there! The timer should have hit 0 by then!
---
Im too good!
---
I'm switching to Tieng Viet just so I can see this.
---
I agree, I feel like he needs a small buff like this anyway

First time?

hahahh just Photoshop (editing images), Blender (animating 3d model) and Sony vegas (edit the video and put the sounds). 2ez :)

Im the killer for the light blue section

Me like the idea ,me thinks it's great, me wants phoenix  crow for free
---
Can u give me that a p k m o d
---
Looks like the poco was in a party. (Same name) 
---
And if they are experience players it doesn’t matter. The game doesn’t know which are second accounts - so you can’t blame teaming for that. 
---
Thirdly - if they weren’t playing like noobs - then poco probably wasn’t too upset lol
---
I only cut the small "attack" thingie, i can send you the whole screenshot if you'd like. Could be diffrent from Android to Ios maybe?

Man we get it. Brawl stars has bad match making. 
---
Not to mention I got the star power the same day I got Shelly to 9
---
It looks beautiful! Happy birthday!
---
What if I can't rank up any brawler cause all my brawlers are rank 20
---
You can get it from play store
---
When you attack Shellys or bulls, try and hit them on the very edge of your range. This way, less of their shots will hit you and you will deal more damage to them, allowing you to defeat them.
---
Please stop posting bad match making pics
---
THANK YOU

Why is darth vaders theme playing in my head?
---
Yea it's a nice idea tho. I would like there to be a button allowing you to play these in game. I know some people get angry and don't want this as it increases trolling, so maybe it should be kept to the lobby and if you win
---
R u dumb? Its only for movement control
---
Most people here are completely complaining about teaming but honestly I doubt many people here have an idea how to fix it, and there have been many times where I’ve killed teamers. If you get one low the other one will scratch teaming and kill them.
---
It's a good idea 2, thx :)

Yes. Spike and Leon in my main account and Spike and Crow in my second account. 
---
Y'all just gotta stop using him like bull 
---
I think it's Friday when these offers came out save ur gems for leon no the mythic one unless u have for both 
---
When your the odd person out who thinks Crow doesn't need a buff...
---
(Yes, I have Crow)
---
Mortis: I AM A CREATURE OF NIGHT
---
Sounds cool but this would makes progres much easier and thats maybie not in supercell language
---
It Was just an idea for how it could be first-person visual though if you make the baby commenting randomly OK
---
I’ll post a screenshot to my profile if you need proof. 
---
Jdjdn
---
They ready to get cute and cool concept.
---
Yeah I thought about that. It's a good point.
---
Hahaha was he barley?
---
I’m not claiming it until I get better rewards! 😂 I have 23k coins already I don’t need 300
---
:(
---
O still think they will consider implementing it if they see it.
---
That's what I assumed when i saw #stopthespin.
---
Gets skin tokens for carl but there is no carl skin
---
Second best?
---
Holy moly I just got the same idea lol
---
Yep
---
Playing since adroid and 0 of these so pls not more brawlers that the odds are impposible 
---
How big is Boss Robot Barley gonna be? He's a "boss", and Boss Robots are really thicc! If Barley keeps his old size, that's gonna be a really tiny boss.
---
Everyone on this subbreddit these days posting that and it doesn't look good i don't like it when i see one of them
---
Agreed. Won't happen tho cus kids and casuals would quit
---
Useless...
---
I don't you were just being extra and assuming that I'm an idiot
---
sAy hELlo tO mY liTtLe fRieNd !
---
LOL
---
I want it!
---
#not anymore
---
Wow that’s ur first legendary brawler
---
I never claimed that. I just wanted to add that extra fact.
---
It is not bug.
---
Dude just create new account :/ It's obvious that supercell gives more chance to new players for play more. In my second account I got Crow at 500 trophies. My little brother playing since March and have Leon with all epics.
---
**missed his super**
---
Well if that’s all you’re gonna do then I’m not gonna do anything either... 
---
Uhmm....Bo at 1k???
---
You mean bots
---
Wrong
---
That one annoying bastard who is faster than you and kills you when you can't attack
---
When the game was in beta u can get every brawler with 0 trhpies
---
Waste of time im close to get maxed tho
---
Then Idk what it is. It never happened before, and I have no idea of how I activated it
---
I can’t wait :p.
---
Looks a lot like pepper spike...
---
YEAAAAH!Sorry
---
xd :)
---
Hell naw
---
Ty for tryna stand up haha👌🏼
---
This is like bars in Wild West in animations.Everyone is just normal,drinking wine and other stuffs but suddenly fight each over.
---
yea that was just a joke between me and my friends, sorry u had to saw that
---
I felt the same feeling at other game. So I totally understand you. Create new account, play both of them.
---
Btw it looks kinda creepy
---
So bush everywhere
---
#Bull: WANNA BRAWL?
---
GoOD JoB
---

---
Nice fan art man! Even the actual Frank praised you for it. Great job👍
---
5v5...Wait is that league of brawlers?
---
I usually don’t weigh in on all the new maps, but I like this. Really test the skills of piper and makes it a team effort. 
---
I once got a lvl 38 bot with randoms lol
---
We should be able to buy new names with gems.
---
xd, just an idea bruh
---
r/buzzkills
---
Damn boi
---
leon will be proud
---
Yea I agree.. hopefully they add this soon 
---
me eleven
---
This is such a good idea. And by the way, you have good grammar. I dont see any bad English. But anyways that's a perfect idea. 
---
I didn't realized that... but everything can improve.
---
They got us in the first part, not gonna lie.
---
More than 6 hrs :D. Usually palying smaller accounts unless i get team mates to play with bigger ones
---
In fact... All people use crow as it's a bull...
---
Hopefully you get it (barely believable)
---
(+_+)
---
This is so awesome! Also barley super is rockets, that's also awesome! MORE PLEASE, I'M ADDICTED TO This!! Help. 
---
This robot don’t look like at piper is it a new skin ?
---
You could add some special properties to crow, dyna, mortis and bo who have better vision because of (crow needs a buff), light, creature of the night and eagle vision.  
---
Oh it's not cool
---
I would probably break my phone then eat it and puke it. 6 hours are too much for salty gamers like me.
---
this, only play like bull when facing a dynamike
---
*I think your piece of art is worth the time and wait.*
---
Idea for this to make it work is auto-aim is disabled.  This nerfs the shotguns a lot.
---
They're my roommates, well, haha. 
---
Lol
---
I m salty all the time. Especially with the server as if lags a lot. Man no other games lag but bs lags. I dnt know bt bs might need a 100gb/s speed to not lag. They need to fix the server
---
Rastaman
---
This is amazing. Keep creating beautiful animations like this! 
---
i once use crow and juke all colt shot in sd i wanna know so bad how hard he rage (my crow was at 80 trophy maybe thats why i juke him hard)
---
Cheers mate, but there's really no need to post it..
---
No wonder that you dont get a New brawler if you save up 100 boxes
---
...known better as Cavern Church.
---
Yes they shall fall! Oh and thank you!
---
Best idea yet
---
Illusion 100
---
Tara with super: Am I a joke to you?
---
Well Barley is a robot and Brock isn't. Additionally, the Boss doesn't shoot his rockets in a straight line, they sort of curve, like Barleys attack
---
I accuse you of stealing the thoughts in my mind and improvising and making graphs that I never could
---
Looks like two roommates that have some serious pranks ahead of them.
---
gg bro 
---
I'm agree
---
Phew I got away oh wait oh no I'm stuck
---
Aka how to buff mortis
---
Hey man! I'd like to ask you if I could use your clip as a part of my compilation of Brawl Stars Highlights. I'm an editor for the Gaming Curios network. You would be credited with your name on the screen along with a link to this post. Let me know, thank you! :)
---
Or maybe manually aim
---
Lol it’s all good
---
It's a bit hard, considering that Leon's a bit of a stretch, but it's true
---
Bro same😭😭
---
Lol it’s all good :)
---
Thats a nice idea xd
---
I remembered playing energy drink in Stormy Plains. How is this possible?
---
man i still have no epics or above and ive been playing for half a year 
---
I know that, but custom controlls could be better
---
Learn to aim
---
Lag
---
Make it so that this is a reward for beating insane 5 or getting 6 minutes in robo rumble 
---
Can we hit 3390 upvotes? (I shouldn't have ask at this moment)
---
I would love to be in this compilations. Thank you! :) 
---
OMG YESS I've always wanted to play crow becuase he looks so great and is a high skill brawler
---

r/darrylgang approves
---
What I typed was a Simple reply to this post... But nobody bothers to understand it.. thanks that you understood it
---
Probably not, Spicy mike skin doesn't have a light source. So it wouldn't make much sense because skins are different.
---
now all you have to do left is

Who’s next?
---
I think I just have really bad luck
---
Viva la revolution 
---
Thank you for your upvote : )
---
I know 😢😢
---
Autoaim makes sense a lot of the time with Frank. Not usually in groups but if it's 1 v 1 and they're running away that slightly faster speed matters
---
You're a genius
---
S1mple?
---
Thanks but it's brawl ball now so I can't play siege
---
lets say he got nurffed :D
---
Bear needs his lunch
---
Please locate your homosexuality somewhere else 👍
---
I got him at 3500 with 15 brawlers. I got the Pam on the next box. (Small boxes)
---
I like how you tried change your name color but failed
---
Teamers are 99% for me
---

Fortnite is not a mobile game and yes there is a mobile version but still I don't think supercell can make a gamemode with 100 players

---
#WOW
---
good point, but they are still limited to their range. if someone sees them coming, they can shoot them down before the Primo/Bull knows their location.
---
Is there teaming in boss fight now?
---
For me, it would be:
---
* 40% getting ambushed right after I get a kill, while I'm still weak
---
* 20% getting pinched
---
* 10% someone chases me across the map until I die
---
* 10% I'm playing as Dynamike/Piper and they predict every single shot
---
* 5% Shelly in a bush (not Bull because the Shelly killed him too)
---
* 5% meteors
---
* 5% teamers (I'm only at 300 trophies, so it's not as bad)
---
* 5% opponent is better than me
---
Lol so true. One time I was playing as Darryl, I lasted for a minute and got 2 kills but was 8th place.
---
Seems to be a part of the hoodie like the stripe on top.
---
Maybe yes with rework
---
cuz i robot was playing when you left
---
Next time dont buy gems off other websites
---
Jk its pretty simple but god I saw some horrible maps this weekend.
---
a\*
---
Looks more like it should be a Brock skin. What's this gonna throw? 
---
THE TEAMERBUSTERS ARE BACK IN BUSINESS (apart from the fact that they are teamers themselves soooo..)
---
DUDE! YOU SEE THESE?! (points at arm) GOOSEBUMPS, MAN! **GOOSEBUMPS!** Well done! Very, very well done!
---
nulls
---
I opened a lot of boxes now I’m 21/24 (it was mortis) at 4700 trophies
---
It's called quickfire idiot,
---
But good concept anyway
---
No, bc I was playing until the final countdown, but it didn't go to the ending screen it kicked me out :(
---
This is my new lock screen 
---
Bo, barley, dyna, and Rico would be everywhere
---
Disgusting
---
Why can't they make him like the other guys, basically be Bull but with range and other bullshit features
---
This is a really good idea, but... everyone is a  Bull
---
Don't you think Tara and Spike should be higher up because of their area supers which can kill multiple people
---
Queen of the bushes?
---
I wish I had crow
---
smeller of rats vs bringer of bats 🤔
---
Just a question about the range,
---
Does the range you can see differ on different brawlers?
---
This meme reminds me of the true spirit of Crowbuffness!
---
ME like
---
I suggest sending this to supercell website
---
xD
---
i know its more broken than pam. i mean 6 bullets is ridiculous 
---
big big box XD
---
I did that with piper to get my star token
---
Happy cake day 
---
Yes
---
#The enemy team left the chat
---
Holy shit, that's so realistic. Bro you're so talented. Please do more!
---
I think supercell must buff all the legendaries except spike and Leon 
---
Dynamike...
---
4. Teamers
---
Not necessarily.  Originally they were both Shelly but then they made animal a bear and hover board Tara’s shadow
---
new exploit??
---
Oh yes you can't forget the dynamikes and barleys can you?
---
Not really
---
Thats much Cutteness
---
"robot spawns in showdown" so either its happened/not happened or something else spawned
---
Bull and shelly would be way too strong, you would need a way to solve that
---
How?
---
His name should have been Raymond.
---
K.....dont care
---
Although I'm not really good at drawing I wanted to try making a Brawl Stars character
---
Tanuki can transform into the last enemy he hits and replicate their abilities, without having access to their Super and a weaker attack value.
---
Don't refrain to give me suggestions on balancing his skillet :)
---
Her mouth is covered
---
Yes u guys are right well done
---
uhhh why are there no tanky-legendary brawlers, all legendary brawlers get sneezed on and die. also by green circle do you mean like poison and how long would it last for
---
I mean his super makes him supposed to be used like bull 
---
imagine a Boss Robot Brock
---
#THANKS 
---
Damn that Piper is a beast
---
She is very weak and has one of the lowest ranges in the game. She gets outranged by eighty percent of the brawlers and therefore cannot charge her super very well. She needs a better way to deal damage and to be useful. So she needs a range buff si she can actually hit people.
---
I just give Tara some love, it's like nobody remembers her.
---
shut r/crowgang
---
So.... lumpy.
---
 #header1 I love it
---
the circle is to recognize the last enemy you've hitter
---
I wanted to give him a unique skillset, and considering he will copy other characters while retaining his max HP, making him tanky is too broken
---
primo definitely means prime or #1 not the cousin 
---
I didn't sync it to a supercell ID and I don't think I synced it to a Google play, because I connected my google play to the app with my new phone and it still didn't show up. 
---
Yes! That’s typically want everybody wants. A ranged bull but with other tools
---
Nah, not really. She has one of the highest usage rates in lower trophies where there are people who are less experienced and she has the lowest usage rate in higher trophies with more skilled players. So we want to make it so that she is good on both trophy ranges.
---
He’s not the Bo, he’s the rank 1 Carl
---
bull's homeland 
---
Meh. I've seen people losing hundreds.
---
Y'all gotta stop fighting Pam like she is piper 
---
Stop fighting Pam like she is piper
---
Amazing!!!!
---
The top 2 players are tied at 211111 trophies.
---
I love this omg 😂
---
Nevermind that description. 
---
Amazin skin
---
Those are the worst cards. Give her some +4.
---
She can team only with another Phoebe, cause they will nullify their star power haha
---
spike : I don't feel so good 
---
that would be OP
---
