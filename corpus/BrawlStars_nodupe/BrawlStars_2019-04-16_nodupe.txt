Holy Crap. 3 punches and she gets her super back? This is actually a 12 second invincibility shield.
---
---
---
Lol
---
She’s op

It's just a sort of sensory overload.

Everybody gangsta until a random robot starts saying "AAAAEHHHHAOUFHAHAGAHAU" outta no where

i know i was just saying that a lot of people will disagree with you

Secret
---
Tell me plzzz
---
If only they change Darryl's badic attack from 2 shots into one..
---
Playing rocket league RN, dm me
---
I feel it would make the skin like super cool
---
just hold try and let go after you swipe to bunny penny
---
Should have gotten a iPhone 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Degenerates like you belong on the cross

Bruh that’s already out

Poco will rise again

Ooooo nice

---
37490 DPS with a power 4 tara lol
---
Kara, Darryl, and Leon don't say a single word in the game
---
Poco as a better healer but pam as a better combatant maybe? Pam probably needs a small range nerf but still.
---
hide in the bushes or get sucked into the vortex of doom
---
serenade poco
---
Lmao iPhones are better 📱
---
no im best
---
They just give in this update... Carl a voice. Meanwhile Tara or Leon didn't even get anything new.
---
You switch by pressing the arrow and with another finger press try while its switching
---
*silence*
---
What? Please explain I've never hear of this.
---
Tara, Darryl, and Leon don’t have voices despite having been in the game for a while but Carl just got a voice even though he was just released
---
Same for me
---
This is not my screenshot lol, screenshot is from Lex’s update video on YouTube.
---
Oof. And that was the battle that could’ve gotten you to 500 with Nita
---
Oh ok thanks lmao I never play this sound that’s why I didn’t get it at first
---
Snake Prairie.
---
😂
---
[removed]
---
U gotta give props to the poco, he ran up with him to enemy spawn to heal and support... primo would’ve been long dead if not for the poco
---
0.1 seconds actually affects it a lot and in certain situations can be the difference between a win and a loss. shelly got a range buff and projectile speed buff, but when did she ever get a reload speed buff?
---
also, a decrease in reload speed makes it faster and better if you did not realise
---
Thats a gud idea bcs rn...brawl tv just puts you in a random place xD
---
Or its just me... 😂
---
After crow buff, we need darryl's super buff. Darryl's super without star power is useless (except for brawl ball). And, can you make Darryl's super recharge faster?
---
The exception is when playing with randoms.
---
You might wonder why but the answer is quite simple. Money. See, that Poco has the star power already, but the dude has only 3k trophies.
---
So yea, he doesnt get banned cuz he spent money, and if he gets banned he might not wanna spend more money in the future.
---
Well the skin isn’t out yet which probably means they are working on it still (though it is useable in training) so it might happen
---
The randomness makes cavern churn and island invasion not so fun to play, cuz this is supposed to be a game of skill
---
Why is Nita trying to fit in with modern society?
---
Seriously, nowhere near your level, but I went from 280 to 360 without losing a trophy in between. Made me hit 8,500 which was cool.
---
If you are in practice go on top of the boss then autoaim super like 10 times and you will defeat him
---
I only team playing throwers, top players team with just about any brawler
---
Is this a datamine?
---
What penny glitch?
---
I prepare myself my own grave 
---
#nerfcrow
---
Then frank does a za warudo
---
oh i always wondered why people have the &lt;c1&gt;&lt;c/&gt;. its a code for colour names right? ahhhhh lol
---
yeah it only happens to people that have colour names
---
Oh i never realized, thanks
---
I have never teamed, never will. I think it breaks the game and I'm glad Supercell is trying to fix it (even though it is hard to)
---
when is golden week?

Woah...so you just learned about teaming? Lmao get used to it
---
congrats! he might be my favourite brawler, I love his mechanics and his super and his throw speed is crazy. hopefully he isn’t op so they don’t nerf him :))
---
Lol it’s real. Check my recent posts
---
That's true, and I did really dislike island invasion that was by far the worst map
---
Lol I always lag
---
Nope but I see where you’re coming from
---
Me ! I came to see if anyone else hates the new Bow skin
---
Better game experience on LTE, doesn't play on WiFi anymore
---
It should show on the bottom right hand corner of your trophy road page
---
Thanks for helping 😂
---
crow didnt need a buff
---
"I only team with..." there is no only in teaming. All of it is part of the toxicity that is showdown. You bring dishonor upon throwers.

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO * dies in sadness*
---
Lol, my friend F2P and have 170 gems.
---
Tf man This luck system isn't fair no more😢😭
---
Map nome suggestion: chaos
---
Sad. How many times you team a day? Every game you play? Makes sense. Look kiddo, I knew I'd get hate from the teaming community, like I care what plebs that have no skills say
---
Oh yeah, it is I justed checked thanks.
---
Frank already confirmed that it wasn’t :/
---
I agree
---
And you again...they aren’t going to remove it. Ahhhh *sigh* what a beautiful reality we live in
---
Only the 90th person to post this today
---
I mean low trophies as in 50s and below.
---
Why is she so fast
---
Big oof
---
Starts on April 28th I believe. You can look it up if you want to clarify
---
There’s some sound issues too where supers don’t make any sound
---
Ah, another Solo SD teaming main, ahhhhhh, what a waste of space you are.
---
🎷🗿
---
The exit is to your left sir.
---
No it's awesome
---
Thanks
---
Brawlers*
---
She is a rare, your chance will not decretase that much. I mean, I unlocked Carl and Gene the same day, and mine barely got reduced
---
I’d just save and save till she comes out, cuz even if u her her in an early box you’ll still get powerpoints after you get her. And she’s gonna be a rare so it won’t be hard to get her early.
---
I will not change your mind because you are right. Penny’s mortar even has better accuracy than randoms
---
Great idea, but I think you had the colors backwards, like with Leon, the closer you are to an enemy the more damage the fidget spinner does as the same with piper but in reverse, the red for leon should be at the beginning of the colors, and the other way around for piper.
---
Thanks, we can use it right?
---
I did not put many details in the post but the idea was that the colored aim was used in a "tutorial" for new brawlers
---
In Brawl Stars, these small numbers really affect, specially for a brawler like Crow who usually depens on chip damage. Think about that 20 damage in large scale through the match, and while it may not be that much, I believe it will enough so he isn't underpowered or overpowered
---
I don’t even know why they did it as well, this new update randoms have gotten worse
---
Its all described here:
---
 https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/bdoz1z/character_concept_stats_anubis/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Imo, anything over 150 trophies isn't normal at your trophy range. I go on massive losing streaks sometimes and I drop maybe 50-100 trophies when I'm just under 5k. There has to be some sort of a disconnect here. Without being able to spectate your matches or being able to look at your profile, it's tough to say what's going on.
---
You don't need to look at videos to do well. Auto-aiming with shelly/bull/primo alone should net you 900 trophies lol
---
OMG, SHELLY CAN KILL BOTS WITH NO AIM SO EASY AT CLOSE RANGE, SHE IS OP!!! NERF HER!!!
---
They gave her a buff because she was bad and one of tHe worst brawlers. Period.
---
Great! In the game it can block the view of player.
---
They made the spikes and flowers in Sakura Spike’s super extremely small, I wonder if it is intentional.
---
UNPLAYABLE
---
I prefer this new animation
---
Has it been said when she comes out?
---
Used the Training Cave Glitch?
---
i honestly dont know why people want shiba nita so much
---
Carl voice makes him sound like a nerd
---
It was true about the 80% and with her high health it’s going to be very OP.  Maybe a nerf as soon as she comes out.
---
They removed the color with coding, but added it to the profile. I recommend just changing your band to whatever you want without the code then click the settings button on your name and you can pick the color you want. I hope this makes sense
---
Yes please it’s confusing
---
This is true, Rosa with her SP I basically pan but her healing station is in every bush
---
i know i saw it
---
sure, in 3 days I will publish another 6 brawlers
---
I kinda liked island, but cavern was just dumb
---
Hey this looks rly awesome^^ i disagree your facial fetures are alright and i like your art style its rly pretty and awesome. Only problem i have is its just hard to see 😅 but besides that its a great drawing^^ idk what that guy saying its horrible is talking about^^ love the detail aswell keep it up
---
I've seen to many certain Japanese movies... 100% would not approach
---
When i start a match, it goes fine, but the rematch and so forth comes laggy, i find the only temporary fix is to close and open the game again, samsung s6 edge.
---
(Speaks Tara for a few seconds)
---
No.
---
Yes grain I did as well check my page
---
Thanks. ^_^
---
Amazing
---
meeeee
---
Penny's Star Power is good in Bounty Layer Cake, and in GemGrab Chill Cave
---
Those bugs happen to me too after this update
---
I just realised that taras another eye is visible and not her teeth.
---
Someone fucking kill me i've had tara for 14 monthsa
---
Yeah i wana bring this post up on the subredit so it gets the atention it needs from supercell
---
I really need a Leon. I bought 950 gems for 2 months and not appearing yet.
---
ThIcCoChEt got a buff
---
acc. to me as soon as rosa is released... everyone will be using her..... coz she is rare
---
You're lucky I had to play against OG (who at the time was ranked 2nd in the world) one time. It did not go well for me who only had about 6000 trophies total
---
Ah yea hentai
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL

Omg I love this
---
Why?
---
My Shelly tilted because I played 4 solo showdowns and got 10th. I have great wifi, and I was questioning if it was the game or my phone or whatever. So I started playing some CS GO on my computer (on the same wifi) and it ran like a gem. I guess we're having the same problems.
---
This is cool :D
---
My Shelly tilted 20 trophies from this bull
---
awawwa amazing :'&gt;
---
Am I the only one who thinks Supercell nerfed Leon the wrong way?
---
A lot of ppl are having this issue rn. We literally can’t play the game. Every game is just lagging hard, like every 3 seconds, you get stuck for a while. Your words are just showing how simple and naive a person you are. Too young too simple! Sometimes naive.
---
Don’t worry about getting her too fast, if you have like 30+ boxes saved up you should get her.
---
It worked, i tried it
---
I thought of a 2 reworks, the names I've dubbed are Doubooms, and Big Bang
---
Doubooms: When Penny's bag hit a target and split into her doubloons they now have blast damage and after blast (They still contain the Peirce property of attack) they can scatter in a 3 by 3 tile radius.
---
Big Bang: When Penny's cannon is destroyed it shoots one last Mega Bomb that explodes in a 10 tile radius and deals 2500 damage depending on what your current position is, if the bomb land on you or in a 1-3 tile radius you instantly die no matter the health, 4-7 you take 2500 damage and are stunned for 2-3 seconds and slowed by 75% because of the blast wave or shell shock as a certain syndrome during WWI, or WWII would say, at 8-10 tile radius you take 1000 damage and are briefly stunned by 0.5 second but slow down by 35% and you can be hit by the fragments of the bomb which deal 100 damage.
---
 
---
The Loot Laker: Back on the seas once more, Penny sails her Titanic ship across water, can carry teammates for a quicker and convenient way of travel, has a base health of 8000 can be destroyed and if destroyed you must wait 30 seconds for Penny's trusty crew to build her ship up again, replaces super with a deadly hook that pulls other Brawlers to their impending doom the enemy team can attack the spear to get it off but if fail to do so then that Brawler will be swimming with the fishes, main attack while on The Loot Laker is replaced with SIDE CANNONS this means Penny's ship cannot attack forward and therefore vulnerable, the attacks are middle for cannon shrapnel bomb which main cannon deals 1500 damage and 50 for the shrapnel of the cannon, top and bottom for money shot with a wide spread dealing 800 damage, throws a keg barrel that rolls leaving a toxic trail taking 250 damage per 0.25 seconds the trail will be around 2-5 tiles wide, and after attacking 3 times Penny will send one of her trusty crew members to go and join the battle, there are 4 pirates that can be chosen at random, The Blunderbuss, The Swash Buckler's, The General, and Crow's Peak,
---
Blunderbuss: Uses a mid range attack with a range of 5 tiles that deals 563 damage and has 1200 HP movement speed that is less than any Brawler, after 12.5 second he goes back to the ship to stay until the next time.
---
Swash Buckler 1: Sends one of a trio that go and attack with a mid range of 4.3 tiles drenching you in water slowing you down (if you've ever walked with fully wet clothes) by 5% doing no damage area splash with 2500 HP and has movement speed less than all of the Brawlers.
---
Swash Buckler 2: Sends one of a trio with a mop that has a melee range of 3.2 does 315 damage per swing (one second delay on each swipe) HP of 2000 and has a movement speed that's less than all of the Brawlers.
---
Swash Buckler 3: Sends one of a trio which sweeps like Mortis's attack but only moves a quarter of a tile and does 220 damage has 1250 HP and moves at the average Brawler speed.
---
(Too be continued)
---
how does that encourage account boosting, the people who go afk don't get trophies, thats not rewarding anyone, on the other hand another suggestion is that no one loses/gains trophies. also, it can only be triggered if x amount of people leave the room, so its not "one person leave, and we're totally fine"
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
\+5/-5 helps no one, idk wtf you're talking about, you really think supercell gives a shit if you're good or not, no. they don't give a shit. back to my other point, if you take a loss that wasn't genuine like teammates going afk or some other dumb shit, you shouldn't lose trophies, simple as that
---
TL;DR: +5/-5 is fine but if you lose to something that isn't genuine, you shouldn't get punished, simple as that
---
Wait wait Creator code? Where would we find that?
---
Wait is this a rainbow or just green cuz I’m colorblind and a bunch of people are saying it’s rainbow
---
Thank you so much! This is awesome! It will make Brawler concepts look super realistic.
---
That’s good editing and concept! Wich editing program did you use?

Sorry, not  laughing but speaking

I agree! I think it's cute and funny. :)

yes!!!!!!!!!!!

Nah I bought gold rico, gold barely, gold crow, and kind primo. No flex, but just proving that skins arent only for paying players
---
And you don’t need the Code for the color you can change it by pressing your name in your trophy road profile
---
I am 1000 like, wow

WHY NOT JUST MAKE NEW SKINS FOR BRAWLERS THAT DONT HAVE ANY SMH

Bo remodel in a nutshell

I just pushed 40 trophies with randoms

When will rosa be in the game

Dose your phone have a different font? I dont know im just trying to think of something. Try contacting support

When chuck norris play brawl stars

A level 1 shelly on the try mode is more fun the a max one because the boss will last longer

Lmao

Don't wish death on people, idiot.
---
I don't think it is this Friday because this is developer build and we got no timer in brawler selection screen
---
I lost nearly 30-40  trophies due to that
---
This is not club recruiting
---
Lol what? Leon is really good without his star power
---
This actually happens to me.. All the time
---
I did another 1 it’s a Leon
---
Just change it to I Consume Donkey
---
This ain't new
---
Jessie's turret seemed better until her big game hunt nerf. Fired faster,fired faster moving projectiles, and hit things moving perpendicular to the bullet's travel.
---
I reported you
---
maintenance break
---
Sure
---
seems p fair to me
---
Justice for I eat ass
---
friday maybe
---
No. Matchmaking is based of of pools now, their highest player is probably high in trophies, making then be in a high trophy pool.
---
Again? Noooo
---
Cavern Church and Island Invasion Deleted!
---
No, it is for fixing the lag issues that the update caused.
---
She is very cool
---
Then play 3v3 lol
---
Its a pretty big difference from 260 trophies and 500 trophies
---
Yea it does, once my gem grab map is spectated , my game was so laggy too .
---
He use a baseball
---
Was part of the update
---
I just opened the game and played one match when I got this message
---
RIP us :'(
---
i’m in high trophy.. low lvl band.
---
Can't tell if you are being sarcastic or not...
---
They keep buffing shelly and nerfing Leon. It's just silly. Also he got nerfed 4 times in a row and thats kinda depressing
---
The spike and mortis are clearly in the same squad. That’s why that happened
---
Same
---
Same I got during the match
---
Their highest player was 6k. I alone was already 8k. My account itself is more than all 3 of their combined
---
Fix bunny penny glitch probs
---
Oh shoot, I guess you are right
---
I never see people using Brock on Bot Drop. Lucky me.
---
u/Frank Supercell, are we gonna get Rosa today?
---
Yes
---
So there is going to be a bunny skin for penny this Easter. Will the skin be exclusive and never come back after the offer ends? Or will it come back for the next Easter. Personally I think that it should never come back after the offer ends. It makes the skin have more demand and rarity after the offer ends. It’ll convince more people to buy the skin, and I feel like people that own the skin won’t regret buying it. Please leave an upvote if you agree with me.
---
Idk
---
This photo is from 5 hours ago, if I solve the problem with this maintenance I would be grateful
---
You are 100% correct. ☺️
---
dude its soo funny real talk i died
---
u/Frank_Supercell , can we get Rosa today?
---
Fix the connection issues
---
NiCe OuTlInE
---
Too bad it isn’t to add new brawler
---
Look at Penny's watch, it's 4 days and 17h. So this video was made a few days ago (that's what I think)
---
1. No, don't add "Normal mode". Add a REAL ranked mode that uses league/rank/tier/MMR with a ban/pick feature before each game. The trophy system is not really good at reflecting skill now and I think adding a REAL ranked mode while making trophy games "normal games" would be better for the game.
---
2. Storage for boxes seems cool. Just having the option to buy a mega box but open it later would be pretty cool.
---
Welcome to the leon gang
---
Plz say... It will fix the lag when we start showdown
---
To fix lag / latency issues
---
when it happens, 80% of the attack initiation sounds are gone. and also frequent crashes after entering the main page when launching the game
---
Yes cause 1 mega box costs 80 so your getting 2 for the price of 1
---
:v
---
MAMM?
---
lag that’s about it and some other stuff
---
Starpowerleongang
---
Oh, ok
---
Maybe why theres a maintenance right now
---
Luck, I was the same I got Frank one day then Pam the other. That was before the update
---
r/subithoughtwasfake
---
ok thanks :D
---
202 club
---
you should read update notes they included every small detail
---
Now its 206
---
You just want him buffed cuz you just got him...
---
And leon is one of the most annoyingly unfair brawlers in the game and you're like: hey lets buff that one brawler and make him OP again.
---
Go home kid...
---
i wanna see colt here.
---
well...like whom?🤔
---
Yea,i am of your opinion
---
I did it
---
Shd be this Friday, check out some YouTube video like kairos
---
Say no more. I cannot deny a nita request. :) 
---
(After my finals tho)
---
pee
---
Where Easter offer? :&lt;
---
Who predicted these ?
---
You're telling me you're in the 700 trophies, and don't have a starpower?
---
Datamine
---
Thx!!
---
(◠﹏◠)🥇💙💙
---
Its like rosa but piper mode, i love it!
---
Because it no one in that match had 400 trophies maybe in the other match that you were at 350 other players in that match were playing 400 trophy brawlers
---
El dyno?
---
Thanks ฅ'ω'ฅ
---
Thanks for all being positive on some of my other posts people aren’t so nice!
---
Penny is human...
---
If we talk about uniqueness carl wouldve been an epic
---
It might differ in different countries! But awesome post!!! I’m not here to hate...
---
he's garbage but congrats anyway
---
#NOT THE FACE!
---
Hmm, what legendary drop rate do you have now?
---
oh
---
That profile isn’t mine but that happened to me
---
Oh Right! Damn I had a really clutch showdown in that game😩
---
What do you mean with upscaled Brawlers?
---
"It's over 9000!!!"
---
Me too, its so frustrating getting in the shop 3 times in a row when u tryna get jessie xd
---
Thanks, I'll credit you
---
0.11 (used to be 0.13)
---
*YOU FAILED*
---
Ummm... did u watch diary cory’s 1v1 brawler Ranking video???
---
The matchmaking looks at your thropies, not levels. That’s why there are some endgame players that’s already level10 with starpower playing with low ranked thropy players whenever there’s a new brawler that comes out.
---
you saw Kairos accidentally revel it too
---
The name change and colour change are different settings. You access name change in settings, but access colour settings on your profile (via trophy road.) When you go to the very beginning of trophy road, you should see your name with a gear in the corner. Press your name and you’ll be given the option to change its colour whenever you want.
---
She shoots 3 punches in a swing
---
Left: 3
---
Right: 3
---
And so on untill she runs out of ammo
---
No bug
---
Time in dev build is different
---
Don't get your hopes too high yet
---
What crow glitch?
---
Nice idea!
---
Friday. Its been confirmed
---
Wtf are you see your map
---
Even above 300 trophies there’s mass teaming.
---
Source?
---
Jessie's Turret: Scrappy  
---
Nita's Bear: Bruce  
---
Tara's Shadow: *Sans*
---
Nibba u blind there's no blue or purple
---
Wait. That's illegal.
---
What? I'm not sure, but it feels like you're mixing up characters' 'super power' and 'star power' which are two completely different things. The ring that can be seen around brawler is same colour as the spot under the brawler when his super is ready, and its' coulour just changes when he is aiming his super. So, the colour of the ring has nothing to do with star power. 
---
Every brawler have their 'super' no matter what level they are, but star power comes available when a brawler reaches level 9. When a brawler has star power, ther is visible transparent star in this coloured spot he is standing on. As can be seen from you screen shot, none of the characters has star power.
---
Hoverboard was carl I think
---
FBI would like to know your location
---
Yea I agree, Shelly’s Super has one hit my bull many many times on snake priare
---
Yeah there shouldn’t be a need to change her star power
---
:o
---
&gt;Her super will be OP
---
Happy cake day to you
---
I quote
---
Here's an idea for a Carl skin: Formula One Carl. Make Carl have a full face helmet and an F1 car as his cart
---
Interesting... my 4G lag like shit
---
Honestly Brawl TV is a great way for Supercell to snipe teamers and all. I don't think it's that bad after all. And it still shows other modes than Solo Showdown soooo...
---
Noice
---
r/dynamikegang
---
hmmm
---
I think the cool down for attacks is enough, it’s just you can’t react to him once he pops out, others is ok
---
Being hit by a red card in Brawl Ball oof
---
yeah
---
Looks like one of the villains from Super Mario Odyssey

They done team up

No you should save up for better offers

---
And go to 0:51 and look at bottom left corner.
---
Hey :)
---
They may keep the surprise... or it's maybe just a placeholder. But that'd be very weird for them to put a timer in Developer Build... as they still can play new brawlers whenever then want.
---
I have a question . what would her star power look like
---
hahahahha smh my head xD rip in peace
---
i still dont understand how does he shot bows without a string
---
Match bulls outfit
---
There was also hoverboard I think that was carl.
---
Big ooof
---
Gud art boi
---
Time in dev builds are diffrent
---
Not it takes 5 or 6 for brock
---
Leon the nerfs barely changed him
---
Suomi
---
no
---
Try yourself
---
I dont see anything wrong
---
Yea sure. Let's make them have a bad time :3
---
I AM FROM THE FUTURE
---
And indeed most of these brawlers have come out (except clusterbomb)
---
Hellö bröther
---
Right
---
I’ve seen worse
---
Can you make ronin mortis
---
Wait, that’s illegal
---
It does have discussion potential though. For example, I realised just yesterday that if crow landed his super inside the big robot all the damage would go to it.
---
This is the best skin I’ve seen
---
Great :)
---
Here is what it looks like when you are live on Brawl TV. I was pushing up my El Primo who is around 480 trophies.
---
They should add pay to team
---
Ok did not know that
---
I can teach u if u want ;-;
---
I know how to ;)
---
I mean opponent brawlers
---
Holy crap y'all will make a cool duo
---
I've read "...to bring back Brock's ear to the boombox"
---
You should add this map :D
---
Some siege maps are quite boring or its quite obvious to see where the brawlers are!In this map,brawlers can leap from the air or ambush any enemy brawlers [coming.No](https://coming.No) one knows where the enemy team is!They could ready to pounce from the skies or the bushes!This map has a mix of tactical co-ordination and energy!
---
I found this on youtube
---
I thought this was from shitty watercolour
---
I gotta get me some more of these. This looks pretty cute!
---
This is so cooooooooool, omg nice
---
Really? oh bull mains are gonna be pissed
---
Exactly right? Especially the penny skin glitch. So annoying!!
---
It has been posted here before and don’t just take stuff from YouTube
---
#AAAAAAAAAAA
---
Ooooooooof. Am I the only one who doesn't know what happens at God Mode? (The longest I've survived is until 9s before that.)
---
Post
---
 simply no
---
This was a bit of an r/comedyhomicide
---
....
---
He prob means to SELECT the brawler AND THEN do it
---
LOL! Rosa OP!
---
I admit, I laughed pretty hard at this. He is just a troll, I don't think that that is a reason to report someone. I suggest joining his club and and cursing at him lol.
---
You can stand away a bit further and it will work to
---
I think the only buff he needs is a thinner base attack
---
I had Carl selected
---
I played spike
---
Spike iz smartz
---
It could be a good idea! Anyway thanks🔥
---
Yeah thank you
---
Evolution! It must have passed you by....
---
That's not a thing in brawl stars tho past 300 trophies. I stopped playing solos well before I hit my 500s
---
A B C D E F G H I J K L M Not OP Q R S T U V W X Y Z
---
Y R U JUDGIN' NOT REALEASED BRAWLER.
---
More like Fidget Spinners Gang
---
Good point
---
I don’t think he needs a huge buff to his stats, more so his counters need nerfs. He’s kinda like Crow in that regard; the best buff to both of them would be to nerf their counters like Pam, Primo, Nita, etc.
---
Petition to bring back his dance
---
Frank is cancerous lmao
---
Your name isn’t correct, it’s Bot 3 not bot 3
---
I was against crow buff
---
If u keep tryng to hug her u will keep diying
---
I liked it!
---
Haha you put the wrong brawler there, it's supposed to be crow!
---
You don't know Rosa's stats so how do you know she's OP?
---
r/woooosh
---
Why
---
Removed.
---
Rule 5. Repetitive or low effort posts with a low discussion potential will be removed.
---
And I don't  want  to either,  but you are making me do this by accusing me of something I didn't  do and attacking me personally.
---
I don’t think this is considered as trolling, Purposely losing a match in a competitive game is bannable.
---
yeah, in the first moment i don like so much, BO is my favorite brawler, but i start to like the new skin, i hope in the future the ricochet,.bo, dynamile and brock old skins  gonna be remodeled and the developers put in game with a  opitional skin, like the hat of mortis
---
Happy cake day
---
First thing I did was try out Leon
---
Do you mean that my nicknames seems like family name?
---
Stop what?
---
Because this has been posted a million times and you are definitely not the first
---
I'm gonna delete my response anyway 🤷
---
&gt;trio showdown is literally coming out
---
source?
---
She must have a great defence because of her super
---
It's not that hard lmao
---
Yaa
---
Stop posting bunny penny gameplay it has already been ported about 4 times before
---
the event that you are a big brawler or one of the small brawlers
---
Unecessary
---
This is just a concept. It is not out yet
---
Makes me think of a gingerbread brawler
---
Thank you, I'm right most of the times
---
Posting this. Everyone knows about it.
---
If it was beneficial for him to not die and not be able to help protect the safe from all the robots he was doing a real bang up job.
---
Dear developers, I love your game Brawl Stars I am Russian so I used a translator I hope you will understand))) How about how about adding a skin to the game on LEON, LEON-Assasin, since he's a secretive killer. I hope you will heed my request or my or my advice. Wouldn't be bad. Because this skin will attract many fans of the game Assassin's creed.
---
Carl flair
---
Thanks!
---
But why even make one in the first place?  What made you accuse me of something I didn't  do?
---
How?
---
Look at my profile there is my next one.
---
No more turret meta, please! They are really strong if the players know how to use them
---
35 = 243
---
He means people who team on you
---
Yeah, I better go to the eye specialist near my place
---
Colt looked like a monkey, shelly looked like an alien, scrappy looked like a hotdog, jessie just looked really different but not really bad.
---
And old Bruce looked like a mafia fat dude
---
That's your username? Not just someone who colored their name the new way? If so then yes I agree, but that would be an extremely weird bug...
---
Ok, but be carefull please :)
---
It was a joke. Even my second account has over 1000 trophies.
---
Thank you!! 
---
#:-)
---
Reeeee
---
How quick you charge your super depend entire on HOW MANY HIT YOU SUCCESSFULLY LAND ON THE ENEMIES, only Piper is exception where her DMG actually affect her super charge rate
---
This took some time for me. Take my upvote :D
---
Rule 7. If you want to recruit for your club or are looking to join a club, post in r/BrawlRecruit.
---
For game rooms and socializing, 
---
[use our Discord server  instead](https://discord.gg/brawlstars).
---
sigh
---
No. About Crow's poison, it's actually the poison tick that matter. DMG dealt isn't counted since whether you have Lv1 Crow or Lv9 Crow, he would still need to land the same poison ticks to charge his super
---
Shrek
---
Who cares, stop.
---
What
---
My guess is Easter Bunny on 21st. Rosa on 19th
---
Don't know why the second panel is there, but in any case, well played.
---
Thats nothing to him.  He can easily recover that playing 3v3 with team
---
Or, don’t play solo. If this is such a serious problem for you, you play with clan mates, or use the discord which is filled with plenty of people who are always open to play with you. Makes the problem disappear!
---
__This is fakes you idoit__
---
We can do trio with 5 team but no respawns allowed. (But health regen can be allowed).
---
Bull is still awesome on some heist maps
---
Honestly I like the OG version better then the remodel
---
**Creator Code Concept:**
---
Type in your favorite youtubers/redditors creator code. (These will be given out by Supercell to creators such as Lex on YouTube or GEDI-KOR on Reddit) When entered in, everything you purchase from the shop, the creator gets 5% of. For example, If you buy 50 power points for 100 counts, the creator will receive 5 coins. If you buy a skin for 80 gems, the creator will receive 4 gems. Map creators or top brawlers could get a creator code to encourage trophy pushing, and more map ideas on reddit.
---
If this gets 50+ upvotes I will continue to make concepts for Brawl Stars (This is my First ever post).
---
I will answer all questions below (:
---
This was litterally posted here
---
this just isn't funny
---
To be clear, some of it does have discussion potential, but the way it’s been posted about there hasn’t been any really. Every post in new is just “Hey look at the bug to use penny’s skin!” or “Hey crow can get his super right back after using it!” or “Hey look how I rearranged the bots!” It’s not adding anything new to the community and is just really annoying
---
This is amazing. See ya in hot.
---
You opened a box and got more power points which just makes supercell dumb
---
Too far
---
How gem will rosa if rosa gem will
---
Simple answer, no. Thanks for asking though!
---
What about boom box brocks
---
Bruh it's extraordinary how fried your brain is, did your parents abandon you? Where you dropped on your head as a child or something? Are your parents siblings? Please tell me how you grew up to be this fucking level of braindead

You can say “bruh” again. Again, further evidence of 0 creativeness. Thanks for all the questions... simple answer. Enjoy being banned!
---
He’s OP!
---
There's a reason why showdown isn't 3v3 you know that right?
---
No I don’t. And that’s two questions now homie. Clever;)
---
Tara: Am I a joke to you?
---
Should be 20,000 that says 20 lol and I haven't seen it yet, I'd love to
---
And I love your lack of arguments, and that insult at the end. I guess that's the best you got.
---
I won't change your mind, as apparently the only important opinion isn't yours, the pro players don't know about the game as much as you do, congrats! Now, you can continue being a dick! Nice day, keep crying for the Pam nerf. ❤
---
Google Mokujin so you understand what I mean.(It's a character from Tekken 5)
---
Enjoy your McDonald's name tag in the future
---
It depends on how much you played with randoms in the past. Your "Big Brawler Time" and "Robo Rumble Time" aren't that good but the Trophies vs Victories is great.
---
It's not even power level 1 lmao I have proof
---
The reason being it hasn’t been implemented yet:)
---
No they just made it less frequent
---
In the Netherlands 20.000 is fine as well, and the glitch is very easy to find, I can link if you want
---
Didn't it just end because of a timer?
---
Is it Piper?
---
And supercell gives us a skin that a toddler had designed.
---
nice buffed crow records u have..
---
~~and funnily enough they are all animal related brawlers 🤔~~
---
DONE! I am so happy :D
---
I am having difficulties understanding what you mean with my under-developed brain. Can you explain yourself more clearly please.
---
i opened brawlers as shop but not shop like brawlers
---
I dont mind being span on if I was harassing them or stole a box from them, I will also spin if I kill teamers, someone with way more elixir than me, someone who tried to super onto me, or someone who stole my elixir box.
---
You must be posting your name tag then. Heads up, I don’t want it :)
---
Its because every brawler thats already good and hella annoying gets a BUFF and not a nerf.. For example C R O W
---
Are you proud of this man?
---
Yeah but can you explain to me why it is so necessary
---
This might be the hardest puzzle I have ever seen.
---
R/woooosh
---
You got us one step closer to 1000 bunny penny posts, thanks for your contribution.
---
Gedi kor should be Concepts artist.
---
jdtix should be 3d modelist (final concepting for brawlers)
---
 Just for that detail brawl stars won´t be the same as always, i will never get used to it xd
---
Super true(no pun)
---
The replies are sad, he got 500 upvotes and thinks he’s hot shit.
---
Oh well fair enough, and yes plz
---
Awsome
---
Aw :(
---
at least delete the last post with no credit instead of just reposting for more karma jesus you still haven't learned
---
I think they overbuffed Crow but the Gene buff was well deserved. Crow was already viable and an indirect buff would be enough.
---
Wait, weren't you calling me out for copying your comments? I mean you could've literally just said "no u" right there. You're so mentally challenged that you can't comprehend what you're saying....
---
John Wick
---
Calmed down a bit finally!... maybe, just maybe.... because three people want to play together???
---
Would love to see a 1v1 mode as well. Not sure how it would work properly but would be fun for friendly battles and online matchmaking
---
You don’t have to have Mortis to have the flair. I thought you just missed a 0 at the end or something
---
That wasn't a question
---
ikr, now he just reposts this with credit in the title but keeps this post up instead of deleting it
---
Cute thanks
---
Only I don't have animation of Shelly's attack?
---
Typo they had a Darryl and he pretty much suicided into a Leon I think
---
I agree! It's not like they have a huge advantage in the game mode or anything. They should be given bonus damage when hitting boxes.
---
Shelly too lmao, but the longer the range the easier it is to fill up the super, just chipping away from distance and getting the super to blow their face up
---
That’s a good point! Her being melee definitely helps balance it out. If she was ranged it’d definitely be OP.
---
EL PRIMOOOOO
---
It's just that there isn't really that many people with that high trophies. So they cut a few seconds of matchmaking by matching you with lower trophies.
---
And they did increase the importance of total trophies, but brawler trophies is still the biggest factor for matchmaking, I believe.
---
The statement was specifically about showdown, making your argument invalid. Also, your argument that Shelly does less damage is invalid as well. In showdown, you cannot compare a Shelly to a Piper. Completely different. Piper will almost always lose. Shelly has an ability to get out of trouble faster, piper will ALWAYS die to anyone unless she is teaming or camping. And the fact that Shelly is good in every showdown map and brawl ball makes her deserve a nerf.
---
i can approve this needs to be added
---
Also a nerf to its range because is yust unfair losing 30% of IKE health due to this i sujest reducing to 10 tiles
---
Well I have never clicked on that "brawlers" button anyways. You get ysed to it
---
Supercell: *made voice for Tara*
---
Tara: EEEEEELLLL PRIIIIMOOOO
---
I found out about this yesterday but still it won't be glitching in game because you won't be getting a crazy amount of supers
---
How about ice Rico
---
This glitch is like at least a few months old. Even before the global launch.
---
That is ok Crow can jump away and Leon can turn invisible so Spike can’t poke them.
---
I agree. This whole day was just Notre Dame memes that were actually not funny and this kind of stuff. Just stop. We already know the broken crow skin
---
also when he gets his super it last all match and the enemy players can't see him even if he gets close and he has unlimited ammo
---
/r/ is for subreddits, /u/ is for users
---
I constantly have lag spikes I fucking hate it. Have this problem since beginning but Supercell doesn’t seem to care.
---
This is tight. Would buy
---
What about this is upsetting?
---
Please tell me how I need to hear it for the 15th time
---
Whats wrong with spinning on people. Anyone can do it.
---
Stop. Already everyone knows about this that has checked the subreddit today.
---
There isnt enough space for 10 brawlers, matches would end too quick
---
What do you expect? People are dumb.
---
Don’t
---
Add this skin! It's free money for the companies!(hopefully the artists get their share too
---
Thats just the countdown for the bunny penny skin. There would be a seperate countdown in the brawlers menu
---
You guys broke matchmaking with the new update.
---
No we don’t
---
this sounds horrifying
---
Sad and cute :()
---
Wow, great idea!
---
I completely agree
---
I miss the epic toe shuffle.
---
shh wait until i get her to 400 trophies before the nerf
---
We asked for it
---
But "she" can
---
...so he will not die first
---
Comment to rank ur post higher
---
I’m at 6000 trophies and in my opinion she wasnt that weak
---
Wow, such a huge difference in trophies. Bet he's also 30% better than you
---
Shiba Nita is the clear winner
---
Dont advertise your club. Some clubs you earn by pure efforr
---
She says "Goodbye" to Scrappy
---
YES
---
Thank you!
---
He couldnt killed me even once i ll share replay
---
Only if they can eat a full health bull
---
In the time Shelly gets her final super, rose doesn't have a high dps to quickly get rid of shelly
---
So you just suck that bad? RIP
---
U have to be power 9
---
I got 31k with tara
---
*Rosa* autocorrect my bad
---
You posted this idea...?
---
Dont forget that Leon is a legendary brawler so its normal that he is strong, me, i think that they could buff his attack to the first nerf.
---
That would just be 3v12 ya know... I want to keep my trophies
---
R.I.P old Brock Model
---
When you get to insane and above the boss drops power cubes every now and then
---
You are lucky. I can't remember the last time i got underpowered opponents. Most times i got matched against overpowered or max opponents so i lose most of times against them. Matchmaking is still bad 😠😡🤬
---
Hi! I need to say that the "getting new brawlers from the boxes system" is a very unbalanced system. I saved 2 purple boxes and 32 blue ones and didn't even get a single brawler. I've seen peaple with lower cups than me that have almost every brawler. please fix this. it's very annoying and it bothers a lot.
---
Oh ok.
---
Yeah, ik :P
---
He said star player not star power.
---
Oh! Sorry about that
---
I've managed to datamine a part of an future upcoming Epic brawler (Rosa is Rare) that might potentially be one. The brawler is described to be "baseball dude"
---
Nothing about this baseball dude has been really found out yet, apart from his star power, which my guess is when you have full ammo you run faster with the brawler. Much more datamining yet needed to be confirmed
---
Isn‘t that what the devs are aiming for? A balanced game with lots of variety. Even if diversity is important, balance definitely is needed because you don‘t want to have an advantage by playing a legendary Brawler. They are supposed to be the special ones, not the really good ones.
---
That’s callew Big Brawler
---
Np, it wasnt my comment anyway
---
where is rosa has anyone got her yet
---
Hella money
---
I hated them but in same time i loved them
---
Yes omg
---
Can we see him?
---
Yessss
---
Easily the most annoying bug in the game imo. Why can't he just slide along the wall?
---
Fucking losers) 
---
Always laughed on these maggots 
---
:D
---
We already have many concepts of Firefighter Pam. The one thing that everyone will appreciate is a good attempt of that skin
---
Yes, I will put it for a next meme
---
Dynamike vs Mortis in a nutshell
---
Wtf the old models look better...
---
Wouldn't mind if they straight up stole this idea, we need a female robot
---
Wow
---
Away From Keyboard. 
---
People who leave, basically.
---
Was just about to post this
---
Hey there's a leon behind her, literally
---
Too soon
---
It's not OK except when they were really annoying or deserved it
---
What do you mean swipe then release... and we click the try button on the regular penny skin?
---
Original skin Bo=you, 3D-model of Bo=guy she tells you not to worry about.
---
Sadly, no. The model of the brawler isn't in the files and it appears as a Completely dark Frank.
---
Ik I had to use a Background and Leon was green so I chosen him
---
Milk Maid
---
I see the HTML code everywhere but in game. In game I still see my half colored name when I get kills. Anyone know if this is only on my end?
---
;3;
---
Wow that picture was very necessary to show us what lag looks like
---
Yeah I just figured that xD
---
Woohoo!
---
Only in snake prairie, and even then bo’s star power can mitigate her decently.
---
And gene
---
Awesome!! Did you take a course to get so good? You can tell me? please
---
I don't think the radius needs to be increased. The cannon does an obscene amount of damage already and if it was actually difficult to dodge, it would be OP.
---
The way it is now, it's actually already pretty functional because it disables your enemies from being able to dodge the brawlers who they're fighting because sometimes the best way to dodge attacks is to stand still or backtrack as a juke -- both which will award you with a bomb to the face. And often times, the bomb is actually worse than the attack they were trying to dodge.
---
🤦
---
People wanted a new SKIN for Bo, not a full makeover. He looks really weird now tbh
---
I posted this... no one got the joke
---
Its because you have Carl selected for thà other live game -_-
---
His super seems a bit long
---
*Both teammates have died*
---
I can respect that
---
At this point you're just flexing while replying on two different comments with the same
---
I'm experiencing this bug, dunno if anyone else is too: Some damn beetle thing is messing with my game and plays Siege over and over, losing -500 trophies in less than 2 hours. Please ~~fix~~ kill ~~this~~ it
---
It’s called military time mate.
---
Just don’t spend 2k coins lol
---
Your standarts of beauty are very off.
---
Oops,sorry dude.
---
When you post a Youtube video, hoping it to be a regular BS video, only finding out that it has become meme
---
yees plz!!!
---
Let’s be honest, they over-buffed crow. Pam nerf was already an indirect buff.
---
Yes, discounted megabox and discounted x1000 tokens only!
---
The bunny mortar open your eyes and mouth before landing
---
How? I pushed Shelly up to 450 trophies without any problems
---
All of these issues were caused due to the new update. I'm sure Supercell are gonna find these bugs and are gonna fix them.
---
Today's maintenance is meant to have fixed this issue.
---
Looks cool tho
---
Woody Darryl
---
Delete the comment before the woosh comes!
---
If you scouted properly, Shelly would never get to you at max range and if you were too hit someone with your attack you could see where they are for like the next 5 seconds. Plus... it’s still only TWO GAMES
---
I see dat Bo down there; could've done somefink
---
Woosh?
---
:0
---
I think people oversaw the "Humor" flair and took it WAY too seriously. Just here to point it out

This is the part, where you all run away

# SANS UNDERTALE POCO SKIN

thats not useful information at all this game doesn't need a try room because its shallow and bland
---
Well I was playing with randoms which is the reason why we lost I was the only one that went for the IKE and they both went for bolts
---
Which country
---
No
---
What I unlock: 5 pp and 10 coins
---
What my friend unlocks: Leon

Man, R.I.P

Lol I have no idea where they came from

Oh great you are the 100000000th person posting this.
---
Honestly I think ricochet looked WAAAAY better before
---
It's a building lmao it's not like we're hurting its feelings
---
I really like the charged darryl :)
---
Wait
---
Baseball dude is a different brawler in the files, this is hoverboard dude.
---
...
---
You probably lost connection during the match and afks can't gain trophies.
---
yea
---
uh ok
---
Nice
---
Not really since I knew crow didn't need a buff and I accepted him to be op after buff
---
the drawing style reminds me of Steven Universe lmao
---
Hello there
---
Time to take a couple steps back and start the cycle all over again...
---
Damn
---
Rico
---
thanks for posting this 3 times
---
What is that?
---
Yes mods tighten up on this please
---
Fbi has my
---
Think that he needs a polish like Tara instead of a remodel.
---
"What's in YOUR wallet?"
---
hes still broken
---
If you think shelly is op then you probably don’t have many trophies. At lower trophy ranges, people don’t know how to distance themselves from her and it’s very easy to use her successfully. However, at higher trophy levels she’s not very good due to her range. This was a needed buff.
---
It probably wouldn't be that hard to do either.
---
?
---
Reverse card from the card game Uno
---
It wouldn’t work well in the game. Showdown just works much better with 10 people in the game and it would be really weird with 9,12,15,etc people. Duo showdown is good but anything more I don’t see working.
---
And it's not just tiny percentages no no no its stays exactly the same
---
Cries in Tara
---
I believe meteor shower should not be a feature to all showdown maps because not all people think it works. I think there should be an option on every showdown map for meteor shower to please all.
---
You can't remodel it but you can polish it making to look more better while still looking like the original.
---
I knew this was gonna happen. I don't think he needed that buff maybe they could ad a different buff were they nerf damage and Nerf something else but buff something else from him so he's ok in every game mode and not super op in one
---
Would have been better of u said shelly: * super stacks *
---
