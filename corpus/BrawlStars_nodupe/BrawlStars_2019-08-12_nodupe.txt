Not scared there's no band aid shelly or bull.
---
Shame on that bush camping bull
---
wait until you see Golden Wind season and Stardust Crusaders animated
---
Anything in the game files for screeching solo? Or anything else?
---
When people say this I always assume they mean both the stats and the character, but I wonder who sees the credit on the bottom right lol.
---
How amazing
---
Thanks for the support

Damn dude, do you have nothing better to do? Do you think you‚Äôre making me feel bad or scared?

Don‚Äôt underestimate piper :3
---
I am heavy weapons guy. And this is my weapon.
---
The first bounce was a bit wacky but its because i aimed it toward a corner and made it harder to choose a direction of the bounce
---
quit complaining and actually learn the matchmaking system
---
I just want a good club where I can learn to get better
---
Thx
---
Did it go well?
---
nobody cares about these small minute details.
---
What brawler shall I do next?
---
Prop hunt????
---
Little do you know Leon is in the picture
---
this is another post where these are just small minute details that no-one really cares about. Also your photo-shopping skills are trash you dumb bitch and you should be ashamed of your-self.
---
yeah me too but just for the memes
---
Tip #1: Don't lose
---
Tip #2: Win

me too but just for the memes

The team I never get

Have u tryed crow?? Btw crow and Leon have the same speed

i have spike !

Wow, amazing work man!

do you remember you unlocking crow and kissing your i pad. XD that got me laughing hard

My nerd friend

Waiting for copypasta guy
---
Youre saying that cuz youre at 10k arent you?
---
10k is a joke after the trophy system change. Itd at least have to be 13k
---
I have tried crow, and his low health is so annoying. A lucky dynamike one shots you and his poison isn‚Äôt that good. As for the speed: you didn‚Äôt take into effect smoke trails star power
---
I like the concept but the ult sucks
---
No tengo,pero tengo Twitter,ah√≠ public√≥ m√°s cosas
---
I honestly really like this map except for the fact that there‚Äôs so much teaming in the middle. And playing on this map in duos is pretty spawn dependent over 600 trophies. If you spawn at the top part of the map, you can‚Äôt even see the people below you shooting up at you
---
Nah they're both viable
---
singleplayer friendly matches have no star player, from my experience.
---
Excelente concepto y muy buen dibujo, espero que llegue al juego uwu
---
Gracias :'')
---
It‚Äôs a pretty surreal experience, especially hearing my own voice in his vid
---
Theres a flaw in that second plan. All the beginner primo/bull maining noobs will always choose legendaries to play with. I always feel ticked off when i see those people thinking theyre actually pros at the game, imagine playing a legendary brawler and you get matched with a 1k noob who mains primo.
---
Nice.
---
Genial! espero que sigas publicando tus dibujos. Me gust√≥ el estilo que tienes ^^
---
and sorry because I can't draw a skull properly
---
Lol Nice play
---
Any time. I can‚Äôt stand seeing people steal artwork
---
Because this i like android

A fellow human being who really wants their brawler idea in the game but knows that it will never happen.

Where's the hat dude? He's no Mortis.

I had one random who was a Crow and was also afk

Why am I shaking?

#YO, SPIKE IS MY NAME! I'LL ONLY ATTACK FOR HUGGING YOU, I'LL PELT YOU ALL THE SAME!

That statement is a fat lie.

I've heard it originated in the overwatch community. I don't know the exact details but that's all I know.
---
Dogs or cats?
---
You don't really need new brawlers to win tho ‰πÅ( ‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢ )„Ñè
---
If I saw that running at me I would instantly surrender the game
---
I have 13.7k, teaming is a problem that has to be solved.
---
Seriously, thank you. I was going crazy thinking about what was the purpose of adding that "Nobody" at the beginning of this meme
---
r/brokenspacebar
---
Boone?
---
100$ deal?
---
I love the character model and super but i think it is a little to similar to Brock in term of mechanics, shooting an attack that has some splash and explodes at max range or come sin contact. Personally I would make the blast a bit bigger.
---
Yes, but now after the trophies balance changes 10 points for a long game of siege would be totally fair.
---
thanks
---
Sorry but no

"I've got the essence of Four in me"

It‚Äôs actually Miraculous Ladybug. Instantly thought of it when I saw ‚Äúladybug‚Äù

Yep, that one is legit

I d k how, but using my mini to play with him is just so embarrasing

#Barlatta
---
Why do you want a brawl talk? Are you maxed yet? Why not max first and then pester supercell for a brawl talk????
---
Yes!! Supercell and Blizzard partnership, I hope that happens ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Holy shit. That was insane
---
Yo watch this pick at mid doors
---
I dont really want it, i posted because of people asking wheres the brawl talk.
---
Huh wonder how positive/negative it would effect seige mode to have brawlers not be able to deal damage to IKE. You would have to pick off the enemies attacking your robot. Would be interesting
---
It sucks to face them but it‚Äôs justified, they are unskilled max players. It‚Äôs hard to get through the end of electro valley and enter challenger leagues, and then they go away.
---
Never share religious opinions on Reddit or the internet in general
---
Solo showdown gives you a sense of **unity**
---
I think that wasn't Rosa. Because :
---
1)Rosa's hair should be curls, not straight hair 
---
2)Rosa's hair should be have some torns
---
But he is a robot.
---
No

Only gemmers get too much gold.

Now we know that frank isnt op so noobs beater stop whining about him being op

Bibi isnt exactly op without her knockback she is an easy prey for Rosa and El primo
---
You should try to make the buttons bigger and pop out more like the OG hoodie. If you fixed that than it will wook pretty gangsta
---
I agree with you analogy the entire intent of the game is to strategically use each brawler for there purpose. Open maps I find close range brawlers to be less affective for exsample. It's just my opinion that a run and gunner should be stronger. I find him to be as weak as Piper but at least she makes up for it in power. Also If you can't aim well he is not a brawler you should use lol I just remembered when he was a go to and one of my favorites but now as he is ranked higher it's a huge challenge even with his star powers to hold his own.
---
Except for your level
---
No there is a reason why it‚Äôs set to max 20. r/shittybrawlstars

Looks cool, also that rosa is shiz üòÇ

One punch robot

*the luck is strong with this one*

I got all three legendaries before Shelly

*sees pam and remembers the old op pam days*
---
Ah thats hot, thats hot
---
Wait,You didn't know?
---
True, it simply ruins the game for the other players. Supercell should temporarily ban and/or take away trophies for teaming.
---
Least it didn't get downvites

Epic gamer moment

Dude?! 200 Gem Grab Tokens in a week?!

#Nlw you're Talking like SUPERCELL!
---
Wow you are so smart
---
damn yall toxic asf

She deserved it
---
Just a fucking repost
---
Yeah this is big brain time
---
It look similar to another fan art Arcade Shelly.
---
I got crow at 3800 trophies. Now im 10200.My chance is 0.0787
---
When i got crow it was 0.0014
---
I difnt mean it like that but he is a robot and a robot should be strong
---
Wait no
---
Sii
---
Mortis killed Dyna and took his hat. BOOM. Mort-ike
---
WHAT?! HOW
---
Schlick schlick schlick
---
ZIPY
---
A child filled with knowledge about technology! He uses his teleport ability to go through foes and to run away! (Similar to mortis).
---
Main Attack 
---
Ammo: 4
---
Teleport Zap
---
Zipy teleports to where you aim causing moderate damage. This can be used to run away. Be careful, even when teleporting you will take damage mid teleport. (Maybe teleport through water? Idk to me it seems like a star power, but a weird one.)
---
Super
---
Zippy Ambush
---
Zipy will teleport to an unsuspecting enemy and jump up and ambush them! Can be used as a finisher, or to pump out damage, and (again) to escape.
---
Star Power
---
(Have no idea, maybe a suggestion?)
---
I used Carl as a template, (love Carl alot), so it really original idk.
---
I'm sorry for you but you will get downvoted to the hell
---
Jk
---
Once you're maxed on powerpoints you get gold quite quickly and then once you buy all the star powers you will have no use for gold, I'm mostly maxed just need 6 more brawlers to level 9 and I get gold really easy
---
Right, but still she was getting countered by Bo on snake praire
---
150 updoots and this goes to r/dynamikegang
---
Nice!
---
I didn't use money on games
---
Now that I see it, Yeah it does! I didn't know it would similar to something, but thanks for commenting!
---
Spike is also good
---
Lol
---
Carl has almost 60% win rate so
---
No bandaidü§î
---
No problem

Did you know that your voice is so similar to Steve Carell's?

Am I the only one who sees two bots?

This is amazing

Sorry For Long Title lol
---
Rosa dumb
---
Death.
---
Bruh
---
People who are teaming and backstabing, when THEY WANT (usually when they will die) must be in extra-hell. I am calling it DOUBLE RAT
---

---
Band aid is dirtier than teaming imo
---

---
don't they actually speak a certain language?
---
Nah it‚Äôs just a douche move on your part, let the lad enjoy his personal achievements.
---
unfortunetly that is true
---
Why Supercell don't make 100% legendary when you reach 14k, but if you have all legendary, you get mega box?
---
Great Idea. This is coming from a Seige hater, but would be cool to see in-game! 9/10
---
I think you are in a snow biome and another biome at the same time. Try going to like a desert biome or something. Or ya know build a house so it wont rain on you. Really it sosent take a lot of planks to build a house. But you're gona get 3 doors so, you might need a chest too. Hey heck not, why no build a sheep farm?
---
How many boxes since your last brawler and what rarity was it?
---
Sure
---
I going to says spike going to be sick
---
oH nO
---
Im lvl 99 with 1legendary. Leon
---
PARTNER!
---
Sry i am new but what are karma scores i see some of those in the profiles of people
---
I'm not even mad.
---
That was so funny I forgot to laugh
---
What?
---
The colt and barley were in the same room with the Dynamike
---
She is in top 10 brawler in this meta,i think you are stupid
---
Y e s

We want leomln skin

Shhhhhhhhhhhh

Edit: it is meant to be cursed
---
Im shaking
---
Thanks but it really doesn‚Äôt matter. Just a bit impressed by myself and wanted to share it with you guys.
---
Invierte dinero, 7000 is una cantidad Baja, tango amigos que tienes double eso y no tienen ninguno tambien :/ asi es supercell
---
just joking :)
---
I see
---
Upvoted to 420
---
Yea, except those who cries that they Lost like 10 trophies
---
if you lost would you have called it good matchmaking?
---
LEON PLEASE
---
I have paid $40 into the game ONLY on special offers and I've gotten 99% of star tokens and used all regular tokens since 1 week after release and currently maxed just need star powers.
---
CR like $500 and 3 years and I'm not even close.
---
I did not really think of it in that way, thanks for clarifying
---
come again nigga?
---
T
---
yeah but 4real who would be so kinds
---
Lex are there are to be improved bands?
---
Once you max out power points you get more gold from boxes. Play it smart, don't blow gems on new brawlers or spend gold on star powers. Get every brawler you can to max so you have a chance at star powers. I got leon and spike within a week of each other.
---
The chance of that happening is really low. And people would be smart enough to aim their supers away from those areas
---
Don‚Äôt buy Star Power‚Äôs from the shop
---
No not really it's only 9k
---
Bruh that is waht a call a shituation
---
HHAHAHAH GOD FCKNG DAMIT XD
---
Blue background crow... suspiciousness intensifying ü§î
---
Id much rather have tokens aa rewards than just like 150 star points. Theres no way of reaching 50k for a golden skin anyways so no. Not a bit much.
---
you know what i wont even ask anymore
---
Then what do you suggest?
---
#Why u shaking on this
---
Thank you Leon, very cool !
---
yo wtf this crow
---
I barely did it in the last hour before the reset came by

yes and bibi will get AIDS

This is a brawler concept art that my friend made and if it resembles someone, I don‚Äôt recognize whoever it is lol
---
The question is how did you win
---
6,5k and no leg lmao, not complaining tho
---
H4cks, no I'm joking, I think it was loading the reals idk
---
It wouldn't really speed up the progression, remember the donor would lose Power Points
---
L E A N
---
Cool but not so good

same
---
They can just give em 169 gems
---
or 2000 coins
---
&gt;Also it's called a downvote,

You dont know a very much used english words? Like dislike / like
---
Good point
---
How did no one think of that before
---
SIEG
---
It resembles a teenage jessie who became the apprentice of wizard barley to learn the ways of fire
---
Good job, you made me laugh! you get my upvote!
---
I NEEEEED IIIT!

Are Supercell donating new brawlers and skins to you?
---
Makes sense

You have a reservation for hell on September 7th 2019.

Yes, Really good design btw

He was my Friend and he lost to me the last match so he got salty

How the heck did you find this post

*10rd*

... pat on the back

bro you just posted cringe, you are going to loose subscriber
---
What
---
Probably
---
I got crow before jessie
---
that meme is most likely older than you
---
I Googled banned brawl stars account hoping I would find something that would help me, and I found ur post
---
Favourite Brawler &amp; Why?
---
The thing is after I uninstall and reinstall the game, in still banned
---
honestly it looks great but u cld possibilly add spring traps so dat wen itz showdown players wont get stuck at the side of the lake/river
---
lol that is normal for me coz i have lots of gems
---
I didn‚Äôt get my account back but i made a new one an got better at the game and got mush ore rewards
---
I reset my phone so i can play brawl Stars
---
U mean factory data reset?
---
i am an f2p with 2 legendaries at 3k trophies
---
Lol, exactly
---
Idk I just pressed the reset button
---
this Mortis clip made me drink my slushie accidentally, I‚Äôm SHAKING
---
What if you start a game and then your parents tell you to do a chore? You have to put down your phone/ipad, making you afk, but there is nothing you can do about it. What would happen in that situation?
---
Every time season ends there's hundreds of posts like yours. I'm sorry, i'm just annoyed
---
mine is Barley, because it was my first love in this game ;)
---
Another thrower heist map... why supercell
---
Do you plan to incorporate more data on statistics? Do you plan to work with supercell to offer an extension of these statistics? Or is it being a reflection of the game data but with some time graphs?
---
I wanna see the leon king
---
First of all Jesus it's just a drawing. Second, everyone who does brawlstars fanart copies because the Brawler they drew is art. Third, paintings don‚Äôt have to based off real life things and Fourth, he probably didnt trace someone else‚Äôs drawing, he traced a picture of Leon that he printed out. If he traced a picture of him that someone drew then yes you‚Äôre right, but he‚Äôs just tracing something from a game that he likes. Plus, he still did the background and stuff.
---
Or what if your just drops cuz it sucks
---
r/yesyesyesyesno
---
Yea lmao
---
ata
---
thank you
---
Just 2 questions lol: Have you ever thought about added replays into the app? Also have you thought about added a second saved account for people who want to save a mini account to their device?
---
momento bruh
---
You'd have to do a chore which would probably take around as much time as the penalty. I think people would plan a little before going into a match which would result in less AFK players
---
Piperla (Cinderella)
---
Rip
---
They didn't remove season reward 
---
Star points are the season reward
---
Star points REWARDS EFFORT and more time and effort u put in, you'll get more reward 
---
Star points and star shop will get a improvements like non cosmetic items
---
What brawler concept do you want to see in game the most?
---
You will be able to buy boxes with them
---
lol thanks but 150 of them are from my dyna

Yes

Unfortunately, now we have some problems with the stability of statistics collection in a profile, some users have this problem. Now, we have completely redesigned our system of collecting statistics, but it concerns only the collection of global statistics (now it can be seen on the event screen). Improvements to profile statistics will soon be in development, but we will try to find a quick solution for charts.

Well if you dont like my comment idk what to do is that i dont understand your idea but ok...

yeah you probably aint a pro because of the way you are asking for gems, get a job and buy gems yourself
---
It's when there are 2 brawlers left in showdown on flying fantasies and the gene goes into the gas onto the jump pad then pulls the brawler into the poison, while the gene gets launched into the center
---
Nah, she just looks like Shelly
---
hmm, sisters who got separated at birth ??
---
I'm not from Supercell. I'm just a designer from a fan project Brawl StaTS.   
---
But i'd like to test "Plant the Bomb" game mode. Similar to Counter Strike. Red team tries to plant the bomb. Blue Team tries to prevent rivals and defuse the bomb.
---
He didn't get exactly 1000 like I did :p
---
Actually i got this from my friend idk where they take from so i just repost to here
---
I'll give you a *pat on the back* for making this good meme.
---
I got 2 free .. what kind of achievement is that?
---
I got 277 it's not fucking good crow :crow:
---
It's okay. Majority of my star points came from el primo. Dynamike is pretty good tho. Just don't get near other brawlers that much because he's so squishy lol
---
Why did you decide to create Brawl Stats?
---
Wow I just learned this I thought it would decrease half the trophies of the brawler so I never tried
---
Hmmmmm
---
no, i have 16 levels brawlers
---
Crow seriously needs some kind of buff. What mode is he good in?
---
How can you repley and make vids with the game, i can only post screenshots
---
Hi! Thanks for asking. Very soon we will release a completely redesigned event card on the site, and with it will come the statistics in Showdown, as well as statistics on the best teams in 3 on 3 modes. We've already added statistics on Showdown to the app, so if you don't mind a few megabytes, be sure to try to install.
---
You mean T H I C C ?
---
Gene. Got him from a free box a long time ago :-) And I really like his Super.

Thank you very much

Hi cool question !
---
You have probably seen that events are coming back in somewhat the same order. Or have seen our old post about the event cycle  https://twitter.com/brawlstats\_io/status/963789354811449344?s=20 .
---
But to be honest we don't know the full cycle whats coming in the future but only see the next events for each event slot.
---
To make that post, we collected all events after the update until we started to see a repeating section. But the problem is that we can't use it to show more future events since sometimes there are special events like the winter maps or special modifiers on showdown maps that are not a part of this cycle.
---
If a lot of people like this , we might do a post like this again with the cycle from that update ;)
---
YEET
---
No. I‚Äôm a ŸÖŸä›£ÿ±Ÿä
---
No Shelly super for you
---
Brawl ball Bounty and showdown and you need to play as far range but close enough to hit if you understand
---
Idea for the game: It would be nice if the brawlers reached a new level ... level 20 and with that they could use their 2 star abilities at the same timeü§îüòµ
---
Hey guys, thanks for making such a great app, love it but my question here is "Why?", Why did you decide to make such an app.
---
Mortis needs to have sharpness 5 on his shovel
---
And gets so far
---
Bad map to open and to many bushes
---
Which other function do you want to add to the Brawl Stats website or app?
---
What‚Äôs so bad about it? I like that map alot
---
I can see different combinates for each game mode, i can see a graph of every club trophy progression and also each player trophy progression graph in club, every brawler stats and good maps for him
---
Its not the matchmaking its the players weak skills of using a brawler
---
No big deal. I was inspired by r/pipisgang!
---
Hey! No, not at this time - we are currently collaborating only with KairosTime :)
---
no.
---
We are ready to provide any statistics to the guys from the community, if these data are used usefully and at least 1000 people will know about it. Some players/youtubers we show statistics before upload it to the site/app.  
---
KairosTime our official partner since Stats Royale.
---
no shit
---
Man, if you're bad it's not your partners' fault, you have to see your errors first and then theirs. If your teammates have commited more errors than you, you can say that they are bad, but even doing that you don't need to post it, because probably anybody will care about it. Not to offend, but, think about it.

Ikr, i get it that poco is one of the lowest dps dealers, they added this starpower which made him too similar how mortis does the kill, you know damage + heal except this dude heals a lot not only himself but also his teammates, it will only be a matter of time until poco becomes an assassin

Doesn't really answer my question? Why don't you play 3v3? Seems like there wouldn't be a point to playing if you couldn't play the actual game.

P2W implies that one can pay for a gameplay advantage that is not available to non-paying players. Since no such paid advantage exists in brawl stars, the game should not be considered P2W by anyone.

There are a lot of projects for Brawl Stars i use all the time: a map maker, a probability calculator for brawl boxes, a upgrade helper &amp; different stats tools

ThE super should be a star power instead.

99% of thdse post are of tara.

But no one notices our boy poco.

So we're back in the mine

Wait what happened

lol 108% movement speed vs: 160% health for shelly, 134% movement speed for rico, +140 damage per tick for barely

what a balanced game lol

What is Dynamike‚Äôs Canary‚Äôs Name and Gender? Or at least your opinion on what it should be?! Personally I think it‚Äôs a she and named Dizzy (even if some Dynamike, myself included, don‚Äôt team).

It probably cost 30 gems

I don't think they literally bann you

nice shot

You lost a lot of trophies...I only lost 40...

Hey FF! Do you think it's a good time to start a YT channel for Clash Royale/Brawl Stars at this point?

#just# testitng

Ok that‚Äôs reasonable

still not worth it, save it for token doubler offer

I guess you're right. However I don't know how much videos it will take for me to make a lot of people laugh.

When did you first feel like you wanted to do content for clash of clans/Royale and who inspired you to do so? Was it one of the existing channels?

You made him look like a veteran who has been through all the shit in this world instead of the typical 80's bar bully that he was before. Good job!

* Modestly Flexstit aside *

just a fun fact, bull beats shelly in point blank range even through band aid and super, well, bull is lucky that his first shot leaves shelly's health in between 40% and 50%, so band-aid doesn't do anything

New Leon star power
---
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life‚Ä¶ He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful‚Ä¶ the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.

Brawl Stars was a nightmare before Android because of Discord-combined-teaming
---
Being a troll :(
---
If someone loves a brawler,he will simply push him.but thats beside the point.i dont see the reason why tara is the worst brawler,her reload speed is 20th fastest. R u stupid?
---
i got Leon on a free box
---
Should be a multiplier or something for each brawler over 500
---
True thats why its good to have the super when facing bull
---
People are gonna think they're making tara x poco real :puke:
---
What's your server setup like?
---
I mean its plausible
---
Would have to use triggers to shoot. like... R1 normal attack, R2 super attack. Hold and drag R3 to aim... Aiming would be a little difficult though.
---
Bro tbh 8% movement speed is pretty good.. these other new star powers (screeching solo) included are absolutely bonkers. I have one power 10 brawler, barley.. and his new star power is insane. I pushed him to 700 with new SP on brawl ball with randoms... granted I think I'm nasty w barley but still man it's overpowered and I know it is.
---
Coiled snake: "and rico gets an amazing super off on shelly for 10 gems and holy fuck mortis just entered the solar system holy fuck since when did he kill the rico and teleport back to spawn holy shit he's a god"
---
bandaid: here in a 1v1 in solo showdown w shelly, ah shit I only killed shelly 1.5 times ggs only
---
robo retreat: "excuse me where the fuck did I just get hit from"
---
demolition: "full hp rosa w super? who's next?"
---
screeching solo: "team wipe? another team wipe? aaaaand another team wipe wow im so good"
---
Again that is just your opinion. Nobody should be called stupid just because they don't agree with you... Your not so important that we really even care what your opinion is honestly... Lol
---
Right now we're currently in a transition phase and don't have a team but our selection process would just increase for trophies with the inflation.
---
I'm great how are you?
---
You are so lucky. I‚Äôm at 10 k with 24 brawlers. Also have way less star powers.

No :P

they‚Äôre all likely friends or in the same club

you have to concentrate on buying just one brawler points in the shop....that what i did....first shelly then rosa and bull...now jessie and penny =) next is colt

it saves your coins

We were to late. He/She has already chosen to follow the path of the boxes.

Que app √© esse
---
Maybe you can throw that rosa to r/iamverysmart.
---
If he regained his ammo bars he would be insanely op. If he had all 3 ammo and his super ready at close range, he would be able to dish out 8400 damage in about 2 seconds
---
Because kids. Brace yourselves, the user made maps are coming...
---
Read his name it isn‚Äôt random
---
Yeah but a star power is supposed to be an added bonus ability. It's not supposed to change how you play a brawler
---
I wanted it to be like the early idea of Shelly‚Äôs sp with the chicken, but with an added bonus so people would use it, not too op
---
who is going to italy? predictions
---
Yep, pretty much

Get brawlers to a new rank. That will give you 10 tokens. And so you can correct it

Guys, I'm shaking. I'm fucking shaking. I never wanted to breed with anyone more than I want to with Bull. That perfect, muscular body. Those bulging biceps. The child making reproductive organ of a literal god. It honestly fucking hurts knowing that I'll never mate with him, make him pass his genes through me, and have him care for our perfect offspring. I'd do fucking ANYTHING for the chance to reproduce with Bull. A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that I can't is quite honestly too much to fucking bear. Why would Bull create something so perfect? To fucking tantalize us? Fucking laugh in our faces?! Honestly guys, I just fuck

I feel yah. Lost a first place SD because my phone died. My fault but, I felt bad

isn't it that if you reach 600 trophies with a brawler you get only 50 star pointsü§î
---
Also check out my post on quest idea lol
---
To Kill a Mocking Bull
---
Since you have 1% of chance of opening a SP, you have a 26% chance to open 132 brawl boxes and don't get the SP. It isn't that odd your situation.
---
With twice as many star powers the drop chances should also be doubled
---
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

the most hilarious part is when you are dying inside-out after the trick failed

That's understandable! Most of videos I do on YouTube are update videos. I casually play games on stream as well don't really play in tournaments just cast them :)

That sucks that you didn‚Äôt get any in the shop. I too take screenshots of every box openings and have conducted experiments on legendary chance increase based on random draws, so appreciate your statistics nerdism. üòä

Yeah I‚Äôd like a dedicated section for star power purchase so it doesn‚Äôt take away from any of the shop offer slots but still gives a chance to players like yourself who have gold to spend and are willing to do it.

In fact this'll be pretty cool i imagine having an event where theres a new skin but you have to get it up in fragments (say this skin is golden colt) such as shiny shoes or golden magum guns and such for 400 star tokens
---
Solution1: don't play as Carl
---
Solution2: off sounds and music (I'm serious)
---
How many trophies with your brawler?
---
Luck .. i got mortis n crow in two days last week
---
Landscape and portrait were fundamentally two different games
---
It definitely is a secondary consideration, at least. I remember I never got matched up with any Bo's in the game, until I hit 3000 trophies and unlocked him myself.
---
If you want to you can look up matchmaking in this subreddit and the top post is good proof, but you don't have to look at it. I do believe that people should not complain about it constantly since it is sort of a rare occurrence, but I feel that the developers should look into the problem and hopefully find a solution.
