Mortis:yea F*** you

Shelley with super

Shelly saves Dyna üò≠

This is a quality shitpost.
---
And no I got the last 75 of my 500 solo wins pushing mortis
---
You mean a buff? She‚Äôs one of the worst ranked brawlers in the game
---
The brock skin has x5 quality honestly I think hot rod brock is worth it
---
Very in character for his flair

Why Poco in solo showdown?

This reminds me of the loud house, and lana. Great art!!!

I'm glad you like it! Brawl stars characters are so much fun to draw!

I've had this few times with mortis, rushing into enemy, getting super, clicking it i heard those bat noises, and i died, and still had my super

Take it back

Also Total Bolts in Siege,Total danage to the Vault in Heist,Average Held Gens in Gemgrab,goals scored in Brawl Ball and total powercubes in SD. Yes im going crazy but c'mon its a good idea.

Yeah i agree but i believe snipers in the sides also will be nice.
---
I love it ;)
---
oh no
---
Lmao those Dynamikes were garbage. Great job coming out and getting first place!
---
Oof almost. You missed a 'p' in Supercell. Better luck next time. Or at least an edit.

Good idea it would be added but it's not brock or nita

That‚Äôs basically what you said. They have lower trophies, that‚Äôs BS. Every match can‚Äôt go perfectly. I bet you don‚Äôt know any coding logic or algorithms, so that‚Äôs why you are complaining

Ha! Fool you think you can beat me with that!
---
*Insert Pro-Smurf Card"
---
I disagree. There‚Äôs no incentive to backstab. Right now, if there‚Äôs 6 people left and I‚Äôm teamed, I‚Äôm backstabbing because I know that‚Äôs the difference between losing 1 and not losing any. But if I know I‚Äôm losing one or two no matter what, I‚Äôm gonna stay teamed until I absolutely have to fight.

Dynamike has a Canary, not a chicken

Crow also have that triangle.
---
Also in the same situation.  About to go to HR for my job and fight to keep it due to some incident that happened that was entirely out of my hands.  Been on suspension for a week, and been playing brawl stars to pass time while spending time with my gf.  Honestly its a stress relief, comical chars, not gory or bloody.  Props to a wonderful game to take my mind off whatever is happening to me.
---
rosa is not green, only her boxing gloves are
---
You just be sub 300. Once you hit 300, that‚Äôs a negative 1 spot.
---
nice theory üòÅ
---
I think make it so when he hits a bullet he gains a lot speed. Make it slightly more than the base speed of Morris, leon, Crow. Either have it so he has speed amount of time after hitting a bullet, or make it for each bullet hit he gains .5-1s of a speed boost.
---
Please no, the original one is perfect enough
---
I‚Äôve gotten the most dps by the same method. You have to align the bot in the exact center though.

Duo with randoms if you don't have any friends

I know it sounds bad but duo with randoms is a very effective way to get trophies, I do it all the time when I'm about to leave for somewhere any minute so I don't wanna play in a room, so I just do solo or duo with a random

This is actually very creative.
---
That's mathematically not fair. If you like to play against power 10s with power 1 team, it's your choice, but don't tell that it is fair.  
---
PS this match was balanced via trophies, I would advice for author not pushing trophies until you don't have a level 8-9 brawler or don't complain about the games when you have pushed trophies but not level and you are facing strong players against you
---
Where is it from?
---
That Frank tho
---
Dog you just upset because you are a Leon main. It was super silly that he could pop super and then just chill out for a bit before snatching up his free kill

Lol, he's more than adequate in sd. I pushed him to 500 there.

At least you have some friends playing this game))) I have to play only with randoms ))))

Sorry to understand the pain of a Rico. Rip Power lvl 1 Rico.. Shortest lifespan with 2400 health...
---
People aren't just anti leon for the sake of it, they're anti-Leon because he's still extremely strong. But i feel like this would be a nice change, maybe reduce the radius in which he's visible to 3 tiles, and reduce his range from like 9 tiles to 6.
---
It's really not when a Bibi knocks you into 5 Minecarts.
---
Yea, I totally want to play with a 500 trophy Shelly that just camped and played SD for most of the pushing and has 500 trophies. Most complaints are about uneven power levels, so what you just said is BS. If algorithms with millions were that accurate, matchmaking would take too long. Literally nobody had ever said that trophies matter. I don‚Äôt want to play with a Dynamike who pushed to 600 teaming and having an organized team that carried most of the time.
---
That‚Äôs what I basically  said, but in comic form

no

Well Mortis vs. 6 Dynamikes is crazy hard especially if they have a Barley on their team.

jessie can't do that but it put's you in an advantage against retreating players when they get a bot

I used to never spin, then I started only spinning when I killed teamers, then I started spinning when I kill annoying annoying, and now I‚Äôve gotten into the habit of spinning on almost everyone. It‚Äôs not that I try to spin, it‚Äôs just out of habit.

The worst though is when you spin taunting someone then someone else spins back thinking you‚Äôre trying to team. Like I‚Äôll betray teamers but I feel guilty if I spin first.

Ok.

---
I‚Äôm not sure about anything it‚Äôs guesses ( except if I say I‚Äôm not guessing, I‚Äôm also trying to help) el primo is almost for sure because his name means ‚Äúthe cousin‚Äù in Spanish and the rudo primo skin means ‚Äúthe rough cousin‚Äù which confirms.
---
A Leon disappear on the other side of the map. A dynamike who didn't even know there was a leon, suddenly sees him very close in invisibility mode, cause that leon crossed the map.
---
How many chances for that dynamike to survive ?
---
Almost 0.
---
Leon super and star power made showdown unfair. He's way too OP.
---
On the other side, in other modes, Leon is pretty weak/average. Hard to balance this one.

Hopefully nobody changes the bubble gum White. (The consistency is like uhh...)

So you‚Äôre implying that jokes that mods don‚Äôt personally find funny should be taken down? Weather they think it‚Äôs funny or not, that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it was not ‚Äúlow quality‚Äù.

Leon doesn't need a buff, or a Nerf... He needs an entire rework.

Man,this is sick,first this guy was already in a bad condition as someone was stealing the content that he worked upon,now he got banned for just a small reason that he said bad words to guy who was stealing his content? Cmon mods,you should either ban the guy who was stealing the content,not the guy who worked hard for his content....
---
Same
---
How about Barley, Poco, Nita, Jessie, Piper and Mortis ?
---
At closed distance, Leon owns them all.
---
So your suggestion is because of one brawler, we should not use many of them. Smart.

hey, its been a month. How have you been?

---
It‚Äôs because he‚Äôs new to dinamike. Notice how he gets 4 trophies for a 2nd place in duos.
---
Its very nice. I like it
---
Brawlers don't fit throug one-tile gaps

I‚Äôve seen more free boxes after the update than before it. I think Supercell increased the freee box rate

Smh my head shake

Now we wait for u/Fo0tie0Crazy9 to do the same

---
Those challenges seems nice but they also seem scary. I can already see people losing games because their teammate was trying to complete a challenge....
---
I got Mortis to 320 or so only playing Brawl Ball.
---
After that, it didn't seem like he was viable anymore. 
---
Or maybe in general players just caught on, but there was certainly a time where 9 times out of ten you could get the first ball in right away because nobody saw it coming.
---
accurate
---
At he credited the original
---
Bruh why are you hating on him for this post? He stole the other post your just discouraging his original post?!? Your also downvoting my post because I said this now
---
for mortis soul invasion if he kills a brawler he will spawn a soul that has 2500 hp minion it will shield him from attacks
---
No it is not Kinemaster he edited this on Sony Vegas Professional 13 for sure!
---
Can we hit 69 downvotes
---
Frank said in Ark‚Äôs livestream that they think teaming is part of how solo sd is played and that they are not going to focus on removing it. 
---
Sad but I think he‚Äôs telling the truth.
---
So is no one gonna mension that there‚Äôs only 3 people in a team
---
Sees 1 block gap*
---
Me: NOOOOOOOOO
---
This isn‚Äôt Fortnite
---
Pams turret should do damage
---
‚ÄòFun‚Äô. Only if you have good teammates. 
---
Hopefully they do improve the matchmaking process by allowing us to choose brawlers after being matched up.
---
:P
---
Try to trow a TNT
---
Dam, the Gene one really took me off guard
---
I can understand typical teaming 2 people teaming up against 1 stronger person but big groups need the ban hammer coming down hard
---
18051 divided by 365 is roughly 49. So that means that you played brawlstars 49 years ago? I have reasons to belive that that is a visual bug
---
Guys Macedonia is juat western Bulgaria and Kira is 3rd so I dont see a problem
---
Well how does he even know he is a top player in Macedonia?
---
Mortis is playing alone :)
---
Swoosh this is not. I got the joke, I just didn‚Äôt enjoy it.
---
You mean destroyed by
---
Betraying teamers brings me great joy.
---
Great map, maybe to narrow
---
Mortis's voice is funny and pretty nice but I kinda hope crow's voice was the same as the one in 'no time to explain' video.
---
And ppl complain about lack of updates smh
---
I usually wait a bit longer, maybe 30 seconds, so you are right next to them and they totally trust you.
---
Why did you team?
---
Your right that no one cares I downloaded all of your posts so keep on crying üò¢üò¢
---
Omg can't wait
---
Somebody once told me bull is gonna roll me i aint the best player in the shed
---
With old beta models, they would need to create skins from the scratch rather than just coloring, adding accessories to newer models
---
Then ppl would just spawn camp in 3v3‚Äôs.
---
Yeah
---
Why are people just suddenly going for you? I feel like this is some kind of joke and that person who steals your content over again is the same person... I'm not sure that reddit can fix that
---
Lol you wish
---
Applies to everyone so it‚Äôs balanced. I don‚Äôt see anyone complaining when they or their teammate gets the invisibility shield.
---
He will literally clap you to death
---
Or if you could turn into  a boss if you charge it up or something
---
He‚Äôs gonna jump

Nice

It‚Äôs not like I just stood there, should I have said that helped me push my Rico?
---
As long as you didn't gang up on someone else you're fine.
---
But if I want to max Tara and get Gene powerpoints, I could trade Tara powerpoints for Gene powerpoints with a club member who wants Gene powerpoints!
---
This is a pretty good idea tbh
---
"That... one... Poco"

In the title you said that your team pushed your Rico.

No, this is the one we‚Äôve all been waiting for.

Lmao

[Insert joke about Ikea and meatballs]
---
I've seen it used various ways:
---
Teaming, taunting, [showing non-aggression](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/bomotr/i_wasnt_expecting_that_shit_everyone_went_along_a/), showing you just want to pass by without fighting, and pretending to team so you can kill them without them expecting it.

Colt is a bit too happy

No he doesn't. He isn't following reddiquette. That's why he got banned. Besides, the worst way to try and counter someone mocking you is by swearing at him. It just makes you look angry af, something he wants and has accomplished. The best way is to report the thief imo
---
Why Why
---
WHY!!!!!!!!!!?
---
Nobody‚Äôs complaining the skins look bad, it‚Äôs just why do they need to put them as ‚Äúdeals‚Äù when they‚Äôre really just advertising them.

Just want to mention this has been a problem since u/Imortal366 got banned 286 days ago for doubleposting a survey which was not against the rules

Oh no

Nah, tbh his reaction was appropriate, what if you posted hard work to this subreddit to have it stolen and the people that have stole them not banned? What is wrong with your logic?

When Supercell releases a game in to the beta, at some point when they have developed a bit, they will determine if it will go global or die. Both popularity and how they feel about the game matter, I think. 
---
With Brawl Stars, it was the same story. Mostly thanks to Frank and his love to the game Supercell decided that the game would go global. 
---
Also they released the sunset picture to make the community wonder if the game was gonna die or go global

This meme is good

I‚Äôve never heard this song, but Tech N9ne‚Äôs flow is unmistakable
---
It's just a joke, dont take its too seriously
---
That‚Äôs really good I‚Äôd say thank you this shows that this game is still growing and popular and you did a hell of a job.
---
He is meta, I agree, but I must admit I read your original post wrong; where you said 'reduce is to three tiles' I mistook that as a nerf (which it isn't) and that kind of.provoked my response because it seemed as if you were suggesting two nerfs - sorry.
---
Three tiles' would be good, but maybe 9 -&gt; 6 range is a bit extreme.
---
yep that‚Äôs how it is
---
Not bad but where would I put primo?
---
Smooth
---
Well, Lvl 10 Darryl in specific, with his SP he can survive when he rolls in, kills a thrower and he has a shield to prevent him from being teamed up against from the throwers
---
Boo bad meme Shelly gang is better
---
so 6 bosses versus 5 normal brawlers?
---
Why does it have to be single player. I think it would be great with a 2 or 3 man team PVE. Enter a zone with the team. Kill stuff, make it to the end, kill boss for time. Levels get increasingly difficult with better rewards.
---
Lose animation
---
yes
---
And yes, I am playing on the PC. It has a slightly better internet than my phone...
---
Shoutout to that Piper for being a legend!
---
For which Brawler?
---
No, because technically you‚Äôre killing the people who want to team which is good
---
I think the expression on the brawlers faces answer your question
---
Thanks for the nightmares, though I don't think it'd be that bad because the first match you usually go up against bots that have zero skill.
---
No
---
I don't know. The one you like the most.

Dynamike needs a buff.

Amazing artwork dude!

There are situations when closing the game is important

You mom dies in a hospital but you are in game

So you'll waiting when the match ends or your mom dies?

Sorry for this cruel example but it's truth

And sad

Nice work my dude!! A repost!!

I get your point, but why use Poco anyway on his worst mode?

It‚Äôs good, but a disadvantage for some because at lower trophies, using auto-aim a lot is an advantage

You can't just...

I think so..?
---
‚ÄúThey could fix that by adding in a connection bar on the menu.‚Äù Is what I said. That‚Äôs literally a hypothetical sentence smh
---
what are you exactly trying to correct here
---
Matchmaking isn‚Äôt the problem here, teaming is. Even if there are less brawlers, there still might be mass teaming
---

I'll take it down if someone is a 100% sure

Yea
---
This was an initiative we started in r/PocoGang, and we feel he doesn't do enough damage. We wanted to give him 860 damage instead of 660. So even if he does become strong there's still Pam. His healing is fine but we wanted to improve the damage aspect.

Thought it sounded vaguely familiar, thank you for reminding me about Tech N9ne's greatness

this says nothing but you are just luckyÔºåmost of my randoms are shit no matter in skill or strategyÔºåand lower 1-3 ranks away

I think that each brawler has 3 star powers but you can change between them
---
nah I am serious
---
The Background shows it's Minecarft lol
---
Yeah, I mean we are all randoms. They‚Äôre not all bad. If you‚Äôre consistently losing it may be you that‚Äôs the problem.

If you start throwing matches and trolling then it‚Äôs *definitely* you that‚Äôs the problem, and you‚Äôve become a huge jerk.

You're right, but it's been months since this photo was leaked and several brawlers have been released in the meantime.
---
Dunno, a few years ago? Try Googleing it.
---
Maybe a report feature so they get penalized if they get reported by enough people? If it‚Äôs uncontrollable by the player, nothing should happen, but I agree it is annoying for people to stop playing mid game.

My poor little mortician üò≠ ..... what if he transforms colt into a vampire so they can spend eternity together üòç

Then join a club, I guess. Or quit?

Ruining other peoples‚Äô games is not the answer.

it's just a matter of skill
---
Internet connection shifts mid game? The game crashes? Phone call? I‚Äôve left many games for those reasons and I don‚Äôt think I should lose twice as many trophies for something that‚Äôs not my fault

I'm mostly always have 20 powercubes on Poco lol

Great post!

i think darryl is bad because i have everything at over rank 13 but darryl is stuck at 8 xD. also why i Dont like Darryl is that he has a really bad super. a way to buff him is to make him invincible during his super or you can increase the range of his super to bulls

Yooo I'd buy that album for the concyert alone

You get paired with people of similar trophy level. Just get more trophies

It turns out they acquired majority of owner ship  in 2016 for around 8billion dollars

it's a mobile party game people shouldn't take it to heart if they die in it

Not private lol
---
Friends don't always play brawl stars. Playing with randoms is what most people do and it relies down to:  
---
1. Are they good
---
2. Will they leave the game 10 seconds after the game starts
---
Being good at the game won't help if your teammates are trash
