oh? send the link to the original post or creator?

well yoir point still is the same so my point stands still (shrug)
---
FAKE
---
ok then
---
It‚Äôs based on the top player in your party. Supercell doesn‚Äôt care one bit if you are using a 900 trophy brawler and you‚Äôre playing with your friend at 50 trophies, you will he matched against people at 900+
---
And brock hasnt gotten a skin in awhile. while crow got 3 in one update along with bo. also bo has 4 skins if you count his default
---
No Bibi tho üòî
---
There‚Äôs mods here?
---
Yet im at 9k and got no legends
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/cgf2bc/for_the_animation/ is this what you were referring to?
---
1 question why does crow say smell a bat
---
the gap of a barley, crow, bo and brock skin atm is the same until next big update/next event
---
Fire

[deleted]
---
Im gonna be honest....that looks terrible
---
When he pops up from the ground it makes an effect of dirt or something
---
His hair looks a little detached from his head but this still looks pretty good
---
[removed]
---
Actually the invisible sight is his super so that is probably fine, but being able to constantly break through walls is really, really powerful. He can break through some barriers in an entire clip which prevents other brawlers, whose play style really requires them to take cover, to be able to get the positioning that they need. I think the design is pretty cool with his name being pierce and him being able to ‚Äúpierce‚Äù through walls, but I just think that ability may be too powerful
---
Does his primary fire break through or simply pass through barriers?
---
spoik
---
Very cool design
---
I got my crow to 500 with him power level 3 I used same tactics
---
Dude you‚Äôre telling me what I told you...
---

---
Have a brawler at level 9 at all times, otherwise don‚Äôt buy them. I‚Äôve seen kairostime‚Äôs video, i know how the system works. Don‚Äôt but powerpoints if you have a brawler level 9, very simple.
---
How did as a animation ?
---
*pulls recorder out and plays green hill theme *
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking, but they probably will add this in like a year or so, Brawl stars still doesn‚Äôt have a year since global (it‚Äôs crazy that so much was added and happened in a few months) so global fanbase will have enjoyed most of the casual content by a year or so and most of them will have all brawlers at 500, that‚Äôs when they add comp. they could add it soon but if they probably will add it later
---
Yes. Play your other brawlers. It will make you way better and makes the game way more fun.
---
But you will...
---
Actually buying PP from shop is BENEFICIAL to your progression 
---
Unless ofc u buy every single pp everyday
---
;(
---
How you did it?  Please let me know
---
I'd definitely would buy this
---
Remember when they changed the trophy road the first time and no one got the new rewards?
---
oh wait ‚Äî we did get the new rewards, and we will again. Not claiming those rewards might actually mean you lose them.
---
Well Frank Does Actually have ine of the largest hitboxes in the game so it kinda makes sense
---
F
---
Agreed. People say he is weak but they prob just don‚Äôt know how to play him or haven‚Äôt encountered him in high trophies. Once his mines explode without you stepping on them, he already has another ammo reloaded most of the time. And his damage with his range is insane. I mean like Carl was op with his range and damage. Tick has a potential 1.5 times of Carl‚Äôs damage without any powercubes at power 9, and has an even longer range while being able to Attack over walls. His starpower is insanely good too, I mean, you can survive in the gas with it.
---
Supercell needs to nerf tick
---
Wholesome Poco
---
r/PocoGang
---
&gt;Unless ofc u buy every single pp everyday
---
exactly, so don‚Äôt buy powerpoints...
---
I pay. But it has nothing to do with gaining an advantage. I still had to play and develop actual skills. Skins do not make you better.
---
wow you are cool
---
Does this count as an r/facepalm
---
No 
---
Buy one to two PP from shop it helps u believe me
---
Good thing for the team of Barley, but advance RIP for barley hahahaha!
---
Noice
---
Why would you think that? When they added the trophy road the people who had pushed up high still got the rewards including me
---
mmmkkkk then
---
Free dumplings!
---
Tick needs a buff and a nerf... he isn‚Äôt balanced cuz he is really good in some areas and horrible in ofhers
---
it might be too useful in fact...
---
I like how the team's players name are

---

---
Yup! I think in something like 8hrs the new SP is released. It has game-breaking potential.
---
It is its just rocket shaped cuz he loves rockets so much
---
Just wondering how many trophies do u have
---
Now that I think about it, it makes sense
---
OfO
---
From your perspective, wouldn‚Äôt it just be better to have a balanced map then? You say supercell intends the player to use a variety of brawlers, then you use this claim to support the idea of why it‚Äôs best to use a variety of brawlers by explaining that a brawler may have an advantage on certain maps. If supercell wants us to use a range of brawlers rather than just one, can‚Äôt we have a balanced map that allows that variety? 
---
You may argue that having a balanced map would allow players to fixate on one brawler or brawler type, which then decreases variety, but isn‚Äôt it better to have a balanced map and allow for the possibility to choose any brawler rather than having to use this specific brawler because they‚Äôre particularly best in close range?
---
A map like feast and famine is a great example of a balanced map in my opinion.

I don‚Äôt need to change my view. It‚Äôs a moronic idea. Part of being good at the game is knowing when to use your super. If you‚Äôre about to die and decide to fire half a bullet from colt‚Äôs super, you‚Äôre dumb and deserve to lose your super.

Oh my bad i forgot about that thabks for reminding, so in heist his old star power might be better option but killing people will be easier with new one hmm pretty tricky but i still think new one will be better option everywhere
---
Just a day left to find out let's hooe its not op like band-aid

hmm
---
He saw them lewd

It should only work when you need 10 or less power points

Who see his trophies!?

I would replace all vErY uSeFul rewards with Mega box

The limit is 3 tho. :/
---
but its used in the wrong post.
---
Netherlands first boys!!
---
And it is very hard for some brawlers to survive or kill someone without bush camping (bull, el primo for example).
---
Wha-
---
Showdown can be easily used to push to at least rank 15, then play with randoms to rank 20 to get good then push with other people.
---
Advice to most people
---
You: That is not possible
---
OK so I recomand practicing these:
---
Dodging
---
Aiming
---
decision-making
---
And having knowledge of your role
---
So dodging is needed to dodge piper and brock etc., and is best learned through timing and experience. Piper takes like 1 second in between attacks, so if you can time that, just move back at that time, or don't move at all if you think she might predict you doing so.
---
Aiming is not really aiming but more of firstly anticapatiing where your enemy will go like in the poistion of the Piper in the above example. Additionally, aiming is the sped at which you can aim, which is needed for brawl ball or reflexes.
---
Decision-making is required for dodging and aiming, but more so for decisions such as which brawler to use or if you should enter the bush or if you should fight that crow. The most important thing is to not get scared or overconfident and instead think about what happened the last time you were in a similar situation (but please, a no power cube Crow and a 7 power cube one is very different).
---
Having knowledge of your role is arguably second-most important (to decision-making) as you cannot rush the enemy using Gene in Snake Prairie or try to kill El Primos as Mortis or collecting gems as Tick (assuming you have a choice). This also comes with experience and also can be tilted by anger or overconfidence or fear etc. You should learn what to do playing certain brawlers in certain maps and game modes (oh yeah, I forgot to mention that maps are a major part of the game not just the game mode).
---
The best would be to have an experienced and expert friend to play with you and make sure he tells you where you went wrong.
---
Yes Carl is very good
---
Oh ok thats fair
---
You deserve it brudda :)
---
I did a crime and will burn in hell, I know

---
Accurate xd
---
It does, to some extent. Back then, trophy pushing a brawler to 500 was a challenge, especially for a person like me who usually only plays showdown; the trophy gain decreases significantly while the trophy loss rate increases. Where trophy count may not hold into account is the method of which they were obtained, but overall, they will always gauge your skill level, similar to a ranking. For example, a person with 10k trophies will typically be better than someone with 4k; the only time this is not true is if the latter is a smurf, which denotes a comparison of two other things.
---
When it comes to down to it, trophy count attests to experience and experience, in some shape or form, attributes to skill.

And that's a fact

No need to rage. Most of the people know (hopefully) that you get matched based on the trophies your brawler has. And Im also aware of that the lvl 10 penny could be a friend of the Shelly/Colt but it was kinda funny &amp; scary to see the opposite of a lvl 1 as an enemy. Happened me the first time wanted to share üôÇ
---
May I have a cookie please? Dizzy wants some too. *Dizzy and I both do the ‚Äúpraying‚Äù hand motion*

‚ÄúWhen you see shelly with super and band-aid‚Äù

---
r/wooosh
---
I understand you are sad because you loose, but this match was pretty balanced. Let me prove:
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
343 + 499 + 306 = 1148
---
490 + 305 + 422 = 1217
---
Difference in trophies is 6% and it is a good result. Not ideal, but pretty ok. Have you seen really unfair matches, where people 100+ were matched to 500+ pros?
---
PS both of teams have had same level sum(21). So, get better and you will win more often.
---
Go watch Peppa Pig or My Little Pony, you little kid
---

Ah ha! *takes out a yellow-ish Rock* This here is a lump of pure 24 Karrot Gold! I found it in the mines one day. They are exceptionally rare when all you usually see down there are rocks and Grabinium Gems (made up name for Gem Grab Gems). I originally wanted to sell it to get money to live a better life, but I thought it would be better to work hard to earn that better life. I now give it to you, you earned this, Leon. Use it however you want, I know it will be the right choice in your hands. *Puts the lump of gold in your hands*

Maybe beacuse all who just got bo wants to play him because it's new brawler for them? You also playing him.

I think i can math it like this - 13 000:1.6 = 8000 
---
Well i think this update just broke the game i mean most of my brawlers were 400 before and it was really hard to get 1 level brawler to 300. Now i just got 1 level Leon to 500 trophies and 3 level Rosa to 550 ;-;

Just add a report system and give all players 100 merit. Anyone below 85-90 can only play single showdown and have to earn merits by playing normally. Can‚Äôt just wait them to stop teaming, trolling or leaving the game in the beginning.
---
Yes.

Brawl cats?

but ok if you want to dislike gedi kor thats fine the only thing is not say hes horrible even when you think so. dont say everything what you think because you may dislike him but others can then feel like you offend gedi kor and thats what people hate.
---
Smart

He probably bought all the legendary offers that came our around global and then quit the game.
---
Oh i forgot about it, I added it to my comment in the challenge's announcement.
---
I seriously almost spat out my coffee reading that.

I know that, but I made this idea so that it's easier for players to know where exactly a player would be able to see them.

I think indicators should be added so you can see what your teammates are using. However, I like the added element of strategy that comes from not knowing what your enemy is using until they use it. Some are obvious(frank, spike, Rico, colt), some not so much(Shelly, Rosa, Nita, bull). I love the new wrinkle in strategy but when playing with randos, it does suck not knowing what they‚Äôre using. Band aid Shelly is gonna play very differently than shell shock Shelly

Piper with a drink in feast or famine sucks so bad though, wrong timing mate.
---
Why is there a cursor
---

---
ThanksüòÅ
---

---
Yay in excited
---
Like?
---
Double Shelly
---
No i drew it
---
Hi dynacube
---
Ah yes. At least they did a good job at making them somewhat interesting despite it just being a recolor
---
they haven't removed any for like 10 hours now. They probably haven't gotten around to choosing any more yet. Probably later tonight
---
SHE itself is underperforming in brawl stars actually especially high up in the ladder
---
And thats why they aren't buffing her regular stats instead star powers 
---
Altho bandaid need nerf maybe show the bar to enemies
---
*sigh* Here we go again. Now before you think of me just as a power cube. Let me tell you that 1) I‚Äôll buy you food, 2) I don‚Äôt team, and 3) I Already have friends that are Morti kind. I want peace between our kinds and we can coexist together!

The Trophy buff In a nutshell
---
Oki we good
---
Jam
---
Cool!
---
Im your friend now
---
Yeah. I always forget that she has it. It's a very cheap way to buff her. She is still garbage without it and Supercell will nerf it soon
---
Hooray!
---
Since april/19

Is Dynamike gang allied with tick
---
I‚Äôm not sure but I think a Youtuber by the name of JK made a video on this.

If you go around 1:30 you can see that this could be an Easter egg or I‚Äôm just gullible
---
I believe so, he is a fellow thrower
---
If we are talking about Brawlers without Star Powers, then the whole tier list would be different
---
Tick &gt; mike

This is in no way a nerf. It‚Äôs the same area where people can see him, but if this is implemented, you can see how far you should go from the enemy. Big buff for Leon, I don‚Äôt think it should be implemented.

Theeeeeeedde First!
