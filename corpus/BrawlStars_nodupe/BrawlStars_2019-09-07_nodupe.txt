I love how people think mega=brawler. It doesn’t. It’s literally just 10 boxes packed into 1. And your legendary odds are never gonna be 10%
---
Is 44 views on my Brawl stars vid considered small?
---
If you use nita on this map and use her bear as a locater in the middle you are 300iq
---
Guys, I feel like you're addicted. Just sayin.
---
Lol. Bye. You’re a moron if you believe that.
---
You are the enemy of the people...
---
Ive got literally over half my karma off a single post on  r/entitledparents.

The thing on the left side doesnt have to be fake lol

i didn't found the link
---
My favourite map, can practice my dyna jumps and win most battle with him. Plus all those outplays against mortis was so fun
---
Oh yes
---
We do it at 4 mach speed
---
Its big brain time
---
. İf you could watch the replays you wouldnt talk like that. And how can you call someone you dont know 'moron'.
---
People just complain to much, yes this game is p2w (only a little much less than other Supercell/mobile games), yes some brawlers don't have skins, yes matchmaking can kind of suck, and yes some brawlers still need remodels/ balance changes. But the game is still good, and with Supercell it will be good for a long time. Yes criticism is extremely important but so is realizing how it's a good game, with great devs, and aside from annoying kids who complain too much a good playerbase.
---
Looks kinda like Alice from SAO
---
True man true!
---
This guy starts getting unstoppable
---
With that amount of gems, I would just save up for a legendary
---
Thats Cool Idea!

O! She kinda does. I just googled Alice and Alice kind of looks like Saber from Fate Stay Night haha.

Hey hey! :D Thanks

Wow, in only 3 hours someone has managed to use this format to make the shittiest meme possible. Hopefully this format can actually make people create good memes

I'd definitly go for special magnum unless it's robo fight(?) that fighting big robot with tickets. But my colt isn't even power 10 :/
---
What’s your brothers ign then we can get the skin off namemc
---
Almost as annoying as sorting by new
---
I remember it having that much cactuses cuz u know *sad darryl noises*
---
Lol I'm 15.4k, 8k is nothing
---
Bruh you know how much gold is needed to upgrade? This will make the game more p2w. This post is pretty useless.
---
Oh yeah! Almost exactly
---
Looks like you cant answer huh. 'Moron'
---
Sadly I’m pretty sure there are grown adults dumb enough to fall for that crap too
---
Big ^Oof^ for that Piper

Theres been posts with hundreds of upvotes to remove cavern churn, IM GLAD ITS STILL THERE
---
Imagine if the enemy team was all 8 bits and their supers can stack...
---
it is impossible for a brawler to lose trophies when the brawler is below 50 trophies
---
I agree, this does not seem possible.
---
username checks out
---
But it's better to use El fuego in heist, boss fight and probably siege
---
Dog people
---
Thats basically the pure Truth
---
True
---
HEEEELP

Imagine Darryl rolling, accidentally hitting a cactus but instead of going in the other direction, he hits a spike.

Sorry about my grammar but the enemy teams 8 bit damage booster always has the larger radius then my team so its a problem

Nice map.....but I just need to know one thing, how did you made that map(I mean, which software)?
---
Man can the mods ban you permanently
---
No one cares
---
Awesome work! The dragons and the ghost one seem like they could be a really interesting addition to the game
---
🔥💯 Congrats bro! - Neo
---
Great! Just put on the hat please
---
What I can say is the one in the right better. You can easily get 2000 coins, plus you’ll get an mega box
---

Could be worse

You could’ve thought that Classic 8-Bit referenced anything but a Gameboy Classic which for some reason isn’t the first thing most people in this sub think of

Not sure what you mean but I've had replays "lag" at the same time every time I replay it. I first noticed it when it kept skipping the 1v1 kill in showdown.

Dont play with randoms play with teams

When all 8bits on a match have extra life except you

Yea but only once :/

Removed. Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. Additionally do not use low effort/all caps/clickbait titles.

Great comeback but I just hate that skin

Do you have discord? If yes,tell me and i will give you invite to lex's server,there is a #looking-for-group channel in his server where you can find teammates anytime you want

How about  my post my matchmaking has 2 0 guyvdoing nothing but we faced 600 plus ppl and we won
---
Mabye make the bear icon less realistic
---
Post the replay, not just a pic
---
And? How is that a problem? Nothing wrong with troll faces. If you do have a problem with troll faces then you're a pretty pathetic human being. Old=/=bad.
---
Well, it’s still illegal, if any (or both) of them are underage.

petition to make colt's head the standard unit of measurement in brawl stars
---
An el primo tried to do this when I was colt. (I kept my distance the whole time and when he finally thought to move I killed him)
---
It’s perfectly legal to date underage, but it’s illegal to have sex. There’s an age restriction on that (16 where I live, dunno about other places)
---
I mean, if he wins every match he isn't playing for THAT long
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
What if he likes it that way?
---
at least those people already know how to play the game whereas, this shelly just played one game before this

the difference in trophies is real lol

Why use super to score when you can save it for later?

Brawl and beauty.

Ur awful. And no its not bad. Its just that r/shittybrawlstars ruined it a little bit because they are toxic af there...

You can wipe teams in bounty with harvest

The only tricky thing about this is, that I would have to buy gems for full prize to get this offer, so Im not really sure about that one atm.

Claps

seriously why would u post it on r/rushwars and brawl stars am I supposed to see it twice?

shut up and let people have fun, the artist shouldn’t have posted if they don’t like people commenting

I never heard him on YT , so when I unlocked and heard his voice I laughed lol his voice doesn’t suit him

I'm not gonna participate because I already have Leon and my friends don't have him and they always complain about it when they see me playing Leon. I want to give those that don't have Leon a better chance to win

Can you make it to lvl insane with randoms? I am already there. When do you have time to meet in brawl stars?
---
did you saw the primo XD
---
uh thats kinda normal. I've seen way more primos that jump to our base than primos that jump to the enemy base. The meme is overrated anyways :/
---
Can I use this on the brawl stars meme video I am making? I will credit you
---
Nice
---
that's more square than portrait

But that's the not the music you hear while unlocking an epic.

Welcome to the Phoenix gang!

The robot Is at 56 healt not 54
---
Competitive gameplay is never healthy tbh
---
Bad bot
---
Isn't that a bit op
---
Yes they go down to 525 trophies
---
What
---
also you didn't notice when it said match over but i got killed anyway i was the crow :/
---
Don't even bother. 
---
Chats are overcrowded, ticket bots do not accept all ID submissions and the best thing: It's only [2 skins per streamer](https://imgur.com/a/cpBxFXR) that are given away.
---
Can somebody explain this please? It seems most of it is in Chinese and not English for some reason making it completely useless to most people here.
---
There is also no explanation about how this works, just a tonne of links to random crap.
---
Do you have any idea of what they do?
---
how many games did you play to tilt that much?
---
The fact that the arcade displays "hi dad" as a message means that there is a female 8 bit and that they got a bit personal
---
Totally agree :)
---
night mecha crow
---
ok whatever
---
Fellow brawlers please stop spamming on YouTube streams ur code. The YouTubers are having a hard time trying to moderate.
---
Yes we know its the fact that both of them posted at the same time
---
Fuck no, it sucks
---
Ok!
---
Guys I'm shaking
---
The wording is bad,it says brawlers with 550 or more will lose some of their trophies, so if you have a brawler with 549 it doesn’t lose any?
---
Cavern churn is the best map for rico.
---
No you don't lose any at 549 but you don't gain anything either
---
I'm also experiencing this
---
This meme has already been posted on reddit
---
This is hilarious sp it's excused from the teaming
---
But the majority of the enemy team agreed to lose intentionally . Crow was spinning too, not shooting at the Mortis like : what are you doiing !!
---
I love his voice in game more
---
TOM
---
I mean the game is brawlstars, it has auto-aim. So the skill ceiling is quite low for real competitive play. As such it’s not surprising that a team of pros could lose against regular players. Especially when the competitive scenes isn’t developed at all and the pros are as such not
---
the best players.
---
All these confidents who don't miss a shot and always run away
---
If I play brawlers around 300 they’re ok, if I play around 500 they’re trash. I’m almost 9k trophies
---
google "callmecarson meme template" and you'll find the original
---
Well, they released an op brawler of the lowest rarity sooo....
---
stupid people who think that its very funny to put bot 1 as their name
---
This deserves way more upvotes
---
The rifle should be Rose's sword
---
How about making an icon in this style?
---
Seriously!
---
That guy must have raged sooo hard
---
GiVe Me FrEe TiCk
---
Supercell: sure. if you have 4k trophies
---
i made this game mode in siege's map template instead of normal cause siege's maps are bigger and this will give your team time to prevent the enemy team from reaching the line
---
my phone would fucking crash
---
a supercell me rackou
---
Lol...noobs probs do both haha
---
Feels bad
---
Wow Ive been playing since day 1 beta and cant get that high with any brawler, you just playing with randoms?
---
I saw this on Instagram
---
Yeah lol I don’t have anyone to play with. I had this Rosa at 948 before I tilted and dropped back to 800 lmao. I can’t stand bad teammates who don’t understand how to lane properly and that’s 97% of randoms I get
---
Actually, *pipers new icon shows up*
---
That's why I hate heist
---
u/cansTR
---
did they added it for themselves or cause it is in the game files your post needs to be seen tho
---
bruh
---
674
---
Also some extra info
---
Insane has a total of 11 cubes
---
Insane 2 has a total of 14 cubes
---
Insane 3 has a total of 15 cubes
---
Insane 4 has a total of 18 cubes
---
This means every even numbered Insane will have an extra 3 cubes
---
and every odd numbered Insane will have an extra 1 cube
---
I go where no one goes only when i am desperate
---
Оалао

did you downvote or did an other idiot with brain damage downvoted
---
That 'DD' label is triggering me. I'm used to call them DPS.
---
Ah yes, firefury. We all know that alright I’m around you trophy count with one legend still. Ree
---
Hey, think this update messed up something with the android controls. For some reason every now and then the movement software stick loses focus and stops you, even though I keep pressing on the screen. I have not locked up the movement stick. This seems like a rare-ish occurrence, and I can't get the problem reproduced consistently. Usually happens in the most unfortunate moments when there's a lot of presses on the screen on the firing button.
---
i was playing with my friends, I told them to ready up and i quickly changed to mortis and scammed them lol
---
OK now tell me what they all do. Main attack, super and star power for all
---
lol i laughed at how he runs XD
---
How about a combo of shitty wifi along with ass servers? Thats what i am experiencing right now, shitty ass
---
I played multiple times so the replay was pretty lost in  the battle log
---
Excuse me but what the fuck
---
I rather have spike than leon.
---
Nah more like
---
Humanity beats the terminators
---
Wow! I am struggling with playing 8-bit, and I cannot believe you got there that fast.
---
You should probably mention that it's not your art.
---
Why u playing mortis on boss fight?
---
Everyone was saying why Boss Fight wasn't coming out,Supercell listened and now everyone wants Robo Rumble
---
It's not his work, it was stolen off Twitter. Don't upvote this crap

Sooo true

Its smart to buy tickets.....
---
Um sorry but.. ur goal was..?
---
Yes
---
I encountered a mortis on boss fight. I really thought it was you.
---
buy sark mecha crow it is amazing (better than gold ones)
---
once i lost 150 trophies with crow in 30 minutes but i pushed him back
---
Take my upvote
---
Congrats!
---
How long have you been playing brawl stars for?
---
Would you say that 11.6k playing 7 months is good?
---
For the total?!
---
So you have all brawlers except the legendaries ?
---
If that isn't the joke then RIP that guy LMFAO.

Andiamo, a 500 trofei una piper non può pushare così, ho trovato il random delle partite in duo, è uguale

You just changed topic and didn't answered what he said
---
Em, they obviusly called his name 0bot 1 and bot 2
---
Not his art
---
What's up gamers
---
Lol it's soo funny
---
Did you own goal in brawl ball and sacrifice your teamates to lose trophies quickly?
---
gift^ from^ heaven^
---
Thanks bro! I got many people saying to go for crow, so I'll probably go for crow!😋
---
He's just a thief. Someone else made this
---
Me too
---
 ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
---
Ricoshet: :`(
---
Assholes like OP deserve to get banned for whoring upvotes without giving credit
---
rank 20+ is easy. also this vid is just the piper being stupid as hell
---
Dr fox man u fucking deserve it
---
I didn’t understand it either. I join it, and they will understand that i did join and gift me Leon? ??
---
Or the brawler will walk in a circle for some time and mess the aim button
---
That's happening to me too! I lost like 5 matches because of this, i thought it was my phone, but guess i was wrong
---
That's because of the money model I would assume, clash of clans is a much more grindy game which incentivizes people to pay
---
Brawl stars has a very good f2p model, which honestly makes me actually want to spend on the game
---
Me too lol

I agree, Brawl Stars looked awful when it was announced, most of the models looked janky, their animation was janky as well
---
But as time went on it shaped to be my favourite mobile game
---
Just a little thing, they were randoms

You have to wait 20 seconds and you only get 1 shot and its for 3 seconds
---
Yea seems so op it can take down 83 power cube bull with energy drink in a 3x3 area
---
SMH
---
I think I know from where you took this idea 😉
---
Cool idea, but maybe I’d increase the timer a little bit, since you are supposed to constantly attack with Barley, so you’ll most likely rarely charge the bar
---
Like what?
---
no no no No NO!
---
It woukd be cool, but this skin would need to cost 30 gems to even compete Serenade Poco
---
.. Yes
---
i took a look at jessie's turret old model and oh m god it was awful
---
also the effect on the ground of pam's healing turret was a plain green circle. now it has more details
---
I want to give you an award for this comment

---
you said 'error' instead of 'errors'
---
It explains itself you have to write the number under your profile picture in brawl stars in the chat of the stream and they will pick a person but it's even less likely to win than getting leon
---
But wait, HE’S BLACK
---
I think I love I love I love is hello hello hello !!
---
Aww cmon You broke it so early
---
18k+
---
Why is the graphics like that?
---
You can win very fast in brawl ball, especially when you play at lower trophies like they did.
---
These walls looks like some weird chessboard
---
Is that Mad Matt?
---
I’m shaking

Clean your phone. Like REALLY clean your phone screen. I had the sameness problem up until I cleaned my screen. Also, wash your hands with soap + water and completely dry then. Most of the time this is caused by a thin layer of dried oil or some other liquid either on your hand or on the screen
---
It's just chaos, try do map with some order better luck next time :&gt;
---
I hate when peeps do that
---
No it's Brawl Stars killing them all and waiting for Rush Wars to go global to kill it
---
Its okay but it's not a highlight moment.

I got nothing a few hours ago

Only have Leon left. Now the star powers? Jesus I only have like 3 and have a ton to go. They don't drop. 1% my ass

No

Thanks for all the comments but none said witch game mode I should play....
---
Whoa
---
It's actually inspired from Team Fortress 2.
---
I dont want new brawlers i want power points so i can max out characters for more chances to get brawlers in the future.
---
Lol. Killing spike with mortis in showdown is like Killing any thrower, but you need to wait when spike wastes his attacks, otherwise you die.
---
She’s perfectly good up until insane with snappy sniping. After insane, absolutely not.
---
I actually just opened Tara and crow a few days ago on my mini... For my main tho I don't get anything of course...
---
0.5%chance for me
---
Same here and my new task force is blooming and i just made it two weeks ago or so
---
Doesn't matter. It depends on opinion too. A lot of people don't like the game and got bored of it. Also its really similar to COC so that's why.
---
KAW.
---
Have you watched twoset?
---
I used cringe because it was the only word that came to mind. And yeah, previously memes lasted for years, but its not my fault that memes are now so overmade they get old in like a week, is it? I understand the nostalgia feeling but not everyone feels the same way when they go to a subreddit, expecting *new* content. This really just sounds like an old man complaining about technology tbh, the internet changes, like everything else, what do you expect when pretty much everyone now has some type of acces to it? You gotta adapt to the changes or youre just setting yourself up for dissapointment.

Both my sister and I got Tara this morning

Insane II (Thats right, only Insane II. It is supposed to be easy but because people are dumb and their brawler choices are nonsense I lost)

They are 5k and 6k player zzz while I'm 14k... hopefully they improve matchmaking

I agree

Still friends?
---
The title '' Stop scrolling'' made me stop and look at the texts.
---
The radius is already small, just don’t go in it.
---
but this means no more farming boxes why they had to take out robo rumble instead of big game this is the worst decision they have made :/
---
Feels weak since his super radius is so small by itself.
---
no wonder the top left
---
in last Big Game match I had Tick was the boss, poor guy
---
Just Unfriend them
---
lol there's no sound
---
I never said it's nothing i said it's BORING. And You can auto aim yes and it's dirty but 80% of the time you miss shots. and bush camping is bad that's why i hate solo showdown but when i play i always bush camp. if someone decides to become dumb and walk right into a bush that's another way.
---
I don’t know about circling eagle because it’s really map dependent but I can see smoke trails being more useful
---
I'm in a bag
---
Whenever I play I always hit people
---
Literally every supercell game that has a “pass” gives super value. It’s not like supercell will add it to brawl stars, because it’s already way to F2P
---
Why not to remove big game?
---
And who are these people?
---
I don't think anyone will disagree that robo rumble is the best event
---
They could have reduced the big game cycle
---
I think he’s saying he got them from the same box
---
11500 22 brawlers
---
If COC did a WOW vanilla style I'd be playing that shit every day again.
---
Change the name to AAAAAAA because that's what a roar sounds like
---
Ive only got 1 star power amd ive had a max brawler since the beginning of summee. Now i have 3 max brawlers with no new star powers. But my buddy got tara's star power 3 boxes after maxing her out qnd her other one the next day

hello supercell support system, really cool if you were going to create some commemorative event that the community wanted so much like some Halloween event with some new maps and maybe some really cool serious skin a lot of fun, even more than Halloween is about coming, that's all thank you.

Open them. Star powers and massive amounts of coins are more important now.

same...11k trophies and only one mythic

Exactly
---
Probably a good Samaritan. Was he fighting back?
---
Clash Royale got boring after I reached 2k. I'm at 10k in Brawl Stars and I'm still hooked.
---
I did it in Layer cake, your opponent can not push. It is so fun.
---
This is... not really going to be that good.. the booster radius is pretty small. 
---
This would put the star power in a verry similar situation as Mama's Squeeze
---
Honestly that was 2v2, and your teammate carried.
---
Shes looks and sounds 8 tho
---
Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.
---
The Colt in my team always thinks he's a melee brawler and should get all the power cubes
---
okay bot
---
Do you guys have samsungs? It is going down on my 5s.
---
I got Circling Eagle yesterday, it's very map specific. It's excellent in Snake Prairie and Cavern Churn (maybe FoF) but in other maps Snare a Bear is a better potion (I don't have it)

Oh god u have watpad dont u marina is a brawler concept from a nsfw brawl stars fanfic

This.

Piper without the #THEET

Yeah he had no gun in his hand until he respawn, 8-BIT COMES IN PEACE.

Make it 5

do i have permission to put this on phub?

Well unless they have leggies ,they just think they are the best ,lol

Barley can kill shelly if barley lucky
---
Look it only happens once every 20 seconds and it isn't that useful because the average barley player will miss their shots so they will probably never hit someone with the special bottle. His other star powers are more consistent and are literally always active.
---
The only think in new Piper is bad is her icon
---
Change my mind

Hi super cell hope you guys like it

Lovelyy ! 🎉

Literally every brawler can kill every brawler if it is lucky

Maybe just reverse time and kill them in the womb

1st of all harsh chill second I'm 12 and this is just a little drawing I make better 8 bits though

I’ll use Darryl

So he's a hypocrite
---
Ik weet het.

My badd
---
No he is the only one who was on of the ob's and poor guy still gave no remodel sc better do this fast
---
Yes - 8-Bit's star power should be like that one from Pam. Enemies in the radius of his booster either need to get harmer, or maybe get negative effects, opposite of what his teammates get?
---
Its just band aid but more better than band aid now
---
Actually in the beta el primo looked very different
---
I got frank from 1 box

Need that flex😎

good luck with others brawlers!

Ur opinion?

Well done man! Keep that grinding going💪

Thanks!😉

writhing your code once or twice is “enough” and leaving their stream on as background noise helps

r/throwergang would love this

Any source?

Something about Pipers icon is different..

Unfortunately I don't have time to grind because of school. I also don't have my own team, just playing random duos and heist with randoms, everything with randoms. Thanks!

10000 is now ez dude.. But higher...Can't help it.

By source i mean do you have any photo or video to prove that?

Barley pls

Yes and you add my own touch 😉

Its always when i going to play brawl stars

I try it out on bull, it's like he didn't have a reload speed at all!!!
---
(Before nerf)
---
That’s what I mean. I don’t mean SOME hiding in a bush doesn’t happen. 
---
But camping out in a bush and waiting until most of the other brawlers are dead doesn’t even work at 300. People wise up to the survival strategy much faster than is commonly believed.
---
Lwarb beta
---
I am talking about above 1k individual brawler trophy players like Tom, Yde and most leaderboard players.
---
For bushy maps for example:( both will be from Sd) Cavern Churn is a better idea to use Circling Eagle and for maps without many bushes  use Snare a Bear
---
Yes, will do that ! I also whant to do an "X-box" skin, all green 😋
---
add things for breaking
---
Nice repost *)
---
I figured that. Just find it crazy they don't have a way of blocking them from joining with someone so low.
---
Hi
---
I have 12k 23 Brawlers I don't have mortis gene leon spike and crow
---
Pls explain
---
Not really, a lot of people would run counters such as 8 bit and bull

You have Tara
---
That's not allowed bruh

I'm not..just give me a down vote to reduce my karma

agree with you .. i  don't care about the giveaways i just need new content   don't think that i'm saying : UpDaTe EvErY mOnTh    i'm saying  that  if they start focusing on the updates and the balancing it's going to be much better than those useless things..
---
Just open like 15 at 1 time and you will very likely get a brawler
---
r/downvotesreally lmao
---
Thanks for all those likes
---
I agree with you. Reply to him not me
---
Hm. Really solid argument. But I was addressing most of the toxic comments talking about "free karma propaganda" and "wtf kind of username is that".
---
really!?
---
You can’t expect others to do this it makes no sense
---
I wish but nah no way man haha i bought the light Bo skin. If i didnt bought that i would only have 23k star points
---
30 gem can be to 19 (v rare) 80 to 59(common) 49 (very rare) or 39 I think only happened one or two time, 150 to 129 or 109 or 69 or even 59, 300 to 279 or 199 or forgot
---
This would actually be pretty cool. I take this as a star skin.
---
Peesnats

OH NO DONT HURT PERFECTIONIST WITHIN ME

Just see brock and mortis.... They transforms so smoothly

What is rush wars?

Mouse robot little to op for showdown slow brawlers would get marked

no problem!
---
Yeah go to Franks comment
---
Today offer for phoenix crow is probably the lowest it will go for 300 to 199, 150 to 59 is night witch when is first came out, 80 to 39 is sakura when first came out 30 to 19 is beta times not sure if possible still
---
So is u/SAM383 the new u/GEDI-KOR?
---
"effort" my ass. You had an admittedly hilarious idea for the first post. It takes next to no effort except the idea, which was definitely original. Here, though, there's nothing original and you're simply leeching off your original post.
---
i know a lot of people in that group do organized teaming in duo showdown to farm trophies it’s sad
---
I got 13 yesterday
---
r/engrish
---
Uhm why does it now say nsfw (the post)
---
Country roadssss
---
Thats so weird, if u have 526 trophies u would end up higher than someone at 599? Doesnt make sense to me lol
---
Just waiting for the day that Supercell would take these ideas and put it in the game
---
Oh look,another high effort post to iDontRepost5555 - 5559 to repost well fricking done tho 10/10 for the effort and hard work
---
Yeah I also
---
It means  23 gems isnt it cool??
---
469 is spike + Sakura spike. My guess is around 350-450 most likely .
---
Yee
---
I already saw a Bull using super to get the powercube, he died right after btw
---
69 UPVOTES nice
---
This skin might not be in game but some of yall mfs be wearing it
---
Another of this commentary? LOL!
---
Everybody gansta untilt boss starts spinning
---
Add a damaging bot that hits with poison/fire one with slow down 
---
Add 8-bits and Pam's turrets
---
Add launch pads
---
Add a damaging boxing bot
---
 
---
This could be great

What about 10k players that already maxed their acc and have 1% chance to get a legendary but never gets one?
---
Before the trophy changes I had 5k
---
Soory but 8 dont like 4 hears old playing bs
---
Nice idea! But it's called remodel not rework. Also cool art 👌👍

Because new brawler.

Wow nice
---
I know but 10 day passed
---
sorry, saw some other posts about this and i now realise its real.
---
Eh. El primo can be good but you need to know EXACTLY how to move. If you do it right his damage is amazing.
---
I know, i am just saying if they wanna remodel him they would have done it instead of releasing a new model as a skin for him. That means they think his current model is fine so they released new models for him as a skin. To clarify, crow's skins are new models for him (except white crow and the mecha colour variants) while primo's skins are just skins, not new models, so far
---
Thanks i hope this get popular
---
thanks also doesn't the bat look cute? :)
---
Maybe add a ball
---
Colt getting cubes is good. You need his DPS.
---
It switches per ammo bars you spent aiming to the switcher objective
---
tickets or key doubler,is the better way,but if.you prefer,skins or boxes is an option
---
I mean why did supercell add them in the first place?
---
There are others who need it And thank you for participating
---
usually they don’t know how to move tho, they super onto a landing rocket, burning piece of the ground, sometimes into the bosses lasers or into a group of bots for a powercube
---
Don't know why would you need a ball for
---
Sameeeee
---
It was a joke
---
How'd you do that
---
For mortis player
---
It's normal
---
r/cursedbrawlstars
---
yep
---
(Bandaid/1-up)”Now this is an Avengers level threat”
---
Oh, yeah now I understand
---
Np :)
---
Not all sharpshooters can fight 8 bit head on... It is just too much for a buff with life. All the Close range cast would struggle killing it because they're slower so it would at least be impossible to beat 8 bit one on one on showdown without teaming... I don't think it would break the game but he would be certainly really strong. I want to say nearly Band-aid strength...
---
Ok. 
---
Maybe CoC didn't kill HD directly ( HD is a farming game while CoC is a strategy/base simulation game) but it did it undirectly by changing the gaming trend.
---
Both HD and CoC were released in 2012, when farming games were slowly decreasing in popularity, and strategy games were gaining it instead (Mostly caused by CoC and other strategy games like Backyard Monsters {We miss ya}), which lead people to stop playing farming games and start playing strategy ones.
---
agree with you
---
No. Gedi is still there
---
Oh no! It’s [insert foul language term here]
---
So are Bulls
---
I think he should brew a strong drink for 15 seconds that gives the effect of being drunk for 3 seconds. The visual effect should make it very hard to see and it should also mess with your aiming and shoot times. 
---
Changes to OP's : added visual effects shortened cool down
---
Yes but that is NOT VoC killing hd
---
Wow, very exciting
---
Funny thing is, now that theres more ranks, rank 20 isn't seen or is supposed to be seen as a huge accomplishment. I'll say 700 should be, it gets much harder around there
---
I wish there is one with brock skins

Fair enough. We all have our own opinions and I respect yours.

If you wouldn't mind answering could you please tell me how you removed outlines from the game?

I'm so hungry

Now it ist art

Everyone sayin its too weak but Minimatt didn’t even release any stats just assume the buff he gets would make it balanced

Ah, your a dankmemer as well

It's been over a month and I have 80+ tickets just waiting for it so what gives SuperCell?

This bitch is way too fat.

It worked for me, but what if this is an easter egg?

Nope, he just had a slightly diffrent animation.

I like it

Nice ,take my upvote

And thats why they made "help and support" in clash royale full of bots...

Beat isn’t about a solo effort, you would say the top team in the World Cup beat the other teams.

Honestly how it feels to fight rosa as el primo
---
I don't think so lol it got ignored
---
This is actually good, might need to move the spawns a bit tho

Thank you. If you think there is something that needs to change/removed, just leave a feedback. Thank you again :)

Royale’s player base is still he largest of any mobile game... check wiki on daily active users
---
Since the ones in mid have a advantage if they don't get third partied
---
Even though it is a big number, it is still a shitpost.

bat name stik game
---
Most of my brawlers are from brawl boxes
---
I’m not saying I didn’t have good tm8s, if I believed that I would have said “I carried fandoms against kairostime” or “I and only I beat KairosTime time”. The point of that post was not I had good ransoms it was that not only did I play against KairosTime but I also beat him
---
It just makes showdown identity
---
Barley can kill Mortis about 1/3 of the time, actually. This would be more like Dynamike or Tick

Nice job copying another Reddit video with the exact same strategy. So proud!!!
---
My friend got 32. So lucky. My highest was 19

There’s a shelly that camped on their way to 1000 trophies at level 1. If you can do 500 for one, you can do it for just about all of them if you’re patient enough by camping. I don’t get why you’re so in disbelief that camping is still a viable strategy lmao
---
I feel like this has a  fire emblem vibe to it
---
It's switched by the amount of ammo bars spent in the switcher objective, not by the amount of hit it recieves
---
See ya in hot
---
How did you get boss fight in friendly games ?
---
Trophies in general mean nothing, that’s my point. That’s in part because 500 means nothing, and because pushing to 500 and higher is so easy through showdown.
---
the running tracks a good idea ngl
---
Nita should be a cowgirl, that is all.
---
WHERE CAN I FIND MORE LIKE THIS WE NEED A SUBREDDIT BASED ON THIS
---
Next up: give us all the brawlers at 100 trophies
---
oh ok
---
Hi is this a good play?
---
But then that's reposting
---
This is an awful idea.
---
You stood your ground very well
---
Okay...
---
Are you willing to explain further ?
---
to bad it's an actual skin
---
Baby found in dumpster
---
Also maybe one tricking a brawler isn’t a good thing. It always annoys me when I’m pushing and I find I’m playing with 6k players at 600+. It’s nice to have a rank 25 brawler but maybe focus on your other ones before you start pushing above 600
---
It starts you at insane 16!
