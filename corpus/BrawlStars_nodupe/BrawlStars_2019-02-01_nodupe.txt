Le√≥n should have gone invisible when Nita hugged him

Now we need:

Dypa Mike (geriatric dyna mike in adult diapers)

Dino Mike (Dinosaur)

Diva Mike (Scuba Diver)

Where‚Äôs he at?

I really can't say anything for mortis that isn't possible for any other star power brawler and the fact that on his own you can't really say he's even mediocre. Frank on the other hand has good range and good damage plus even a high reload, the only bad thing you notice is he self stuns when he attacks making his attack immobile making his range feel shorter even though it's longer than shelly's range in some balance changes.
---
a regular match..?
---
You don‚Äôt have to use those guys to win. I usually use penny in showdown and tend to win or come second. If you play well, you shouldn‚Äôt be consistently losing to bull and Shelly 
---
Am I the only one who thought the Shelly was bending over and the chair was her ass and thigh? No? Just me? Ok
---
almost 40 seconds*

---
Ok L I B T A R D. But seriously what‚Äôs wrong with Shapiro?
---
Same thing here. I updated my iPhone (6s) and now it crashes at the start of the game maybe 1 out of 3 or 4 games. Better than nothing. Usually still alive when I get back in lol

ZigZag Bonanza

That's the best deal I have ever seen main wish i had that offer 
---
Most tops really don‚Äôt like how they‚Äôve messed with brawl ball since the update before global launch
---
***Goes to top all time...sees the top one say "1 day ago"...***wow
---
 
---
Thank you!
---
I hate when I'm helping someone and they stop fighting them and switch to me. 
---
Wow nice play! I would have died in a second lol

It can be stuck there for like 1 minute sometimes. And it's also annoying, if you are losing and the opponents throw the ball on the lake you will rage immediately.
---
he seems a lot better for some reason
---

plus hes THICC

and i like the skin

Ultimate camping map, but the map looks fire
---
What are you talking about. He is fucking OP on this map. I just won 13 games in a row on this map
---
I really don't see how this relates to my post...

haha

Yea, the bag is in contact with the thicc body of pam

With an 8 darryl is a guaranteed win. Darryl now is op, just shot and win ahah I just got him to 600 today in skull creek, just wait for his super and go to destroy the enemies 
---
Frank or else primo could use one to
---
noice
---
Holy balls this dude FUCKS
---
I agree with that I don‚Äôt know why people complain like it‚Äôs worse. It‚Äôs waaay better. The only thing that could do is make the respawn wait 5-7 seconds.

Every kid remembers this

Are u f2p

what if they acc siblings tho

this dude is ME! thanks :D gotta make them teamers go extinct

Epic!
---
So, basically Feast or Famine 2?
---
Nope! And there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that, either.
---
lol dont we all want him'
---
3 of my friends already pulled him, all are lower trophies than i am
---
That literally just happened to me today. I tilted 70 trophies just trying to win heist with Rico and brawl ball with Darryl 
---
I like how the dude playing her still had the nerve to continue to attempt to chase you after you gained all that ground.

Lol my bull 17r 370 but my shelly 16r 287

Average trophies across the teams were pretty close, yours was about 264 and there‚Äôs was about 280 so it‚Äôs not atrocious

This is how meta works.

i got him to 600 in skull creek too lol
---
That was me. Crazy game
---
he is not slow for sure... he doesn't get one hit by bull either, Shelly super is the only thing.
---
Star power is too similar to Bo's. A better star power would be something along the lines of gaining damage/health/damage resistance after using the flower to jump.
---
They're probably biologically related so wouldn't it be incest?

English please
---
lol do not expect anything
---
anything under 5 k dont complain about not having mythics or leggys because thats normal

u should get an epic at around 3000

That double xp game mode looked cool, any idea why they removed it?
---
I'm just trying to get the star token lmao. It's so frustrating 
---

---
ynow id like that to happen to me

Left one. More gems, and one more box. Coins aren't that big of a priority, you can get them from boxes

I like it!

No, si no las compraste cuando salieron en navidad no las vas a poder comprar de nuevo hasta la proximas navidad.
---
Yes they indeed might actually want to make more money! Because who knows? Maybe after global, with millions of players now, their data is showing underwhelming revenues? Because the game is not heavily p2w, if it is p2w at all. I'm convinced this game makes a fraction of Royale and CoC - you can't even spend that much to max an account. It appears they're regretting that and need to fix it, idk.
---
Good Idea in the fourth evento this Will bem Very crazy
---
Im only missing crow and the 2 mythics
---
Cheated? What the heck of a bad troop do you guys got over there??? I‚Äôve officially passed the pint in my life where I could even EARN it

The ball completely stopped?

I don't like the change to grass.

That's me trnyna save 1 brawl box

Yes, when the ball stop here no one can get

I think they did.
---
Except that you cant post this here, it is against the rules...
---
He doesn‚Äôt hide anything. He uses facts to control the direction in a debate because that is how you win a debate. Shapiro withdraws emotion from the debate, so you‚Äôve made a baseless assertion. Again, no shit; of course he will use the facts that suit his position. Have you never debated? Don‚Äôt worry, that‚Äôs a rhetorical questionüòÇ

how many trophies u at?

Teaming with a a chance of ‚Äúsolo‚Äù*

Hmm, i see thia in other place

he still runs the same speed as crow

Thanks! :)

I heavily agree with this. Some maps like need to go asap _cough cough_ Cavern Churn _cough cough_ while others I feel should stay. They should also hold a map contest, I think that'll be interesting.

Why did you crosspost this onto the same subreddit?
---
He's so cute! Maybe rename him to Funky Barley or Candy Barley.
---
Mortis‚Äôs play style is an aggro class. I think he does fantastic at what he does. What he lacks in range he makes up by mobility. His main goal is harrassment and killing squishy brawlers like crow, rico etc, and with his super he can sweep an entire team. His damage is also on par after the damage buff and works quite well in showdown. Yes, mortis is quite tough to play, and arguably one of the highest skill caps, but thats not the same thing as strength. Buffing him could result in top players abusing him, because strong damage plus the ability to close ground would basically be guaranteed kills on medium health brawlers in almost any mode.
---
#Made with mematic

They did, you saw old gameplay

still yet to get my first; been playing for a year, xp level 125

I see what you are saying. But I think that will make him like, SUPER strong...

That one Jessie tho

Damn bro that sucks. I‚Äôm only lvl 80 but I‚Äôve been blessed with the same luck as every action movie protagonist ever. Good luck bro I hope you get one soon
---
Use autoaim if you are 5 tiles or less. Her bullet is fast enough to guarantee hits at that range. Pipers has slow reload times so you want to conserve at least 1 ammo slot at all times unless its an emergency. Also in matches, pay attention to how enemies dodge ur bullets and learn their movement pattern.
---
No.
---
Is that Lucy from Fairytail? 
---
New brawl ball sucks
---
It is an issue from the app, not from the phone. I have a J7 Prime and it has the same issue with Brawl Stars. It doesn't happen in any other game I have installed in the device.

5th post I've seen of this guy.

Really it's all over the top of this sub. 
---
I don't remember Leon existed for one and a half years lol.
---
I haven't, I want Supercell to maintain quality and not charge premium skin prices for crap.

True

It‚Äôs a meme? I can guarantee that you are missing your left nut because of the fact that a simple meme hurt you this much.

Uhh, I have all brawlers (Though I did buy Leon) at level 148 and have a legendary chance of 0.1776. Now I feel really sorry for you, or you just didn‚Äôt open up that many boxes...

That‚Äôs automated

But they shiould rework mortis 
---

---
Yes, it's in the patch notes
---
What hypocrisy? Are you bothered that I specifically mentioned conservative opinions? If liberals were passing off their opinions as facts I'd include them too. Unfortunately, liberals have the painful task of constantly providing researched facts that conservatives ignore because they don't like hearing that science typically disagrees with them.

I‚Äôm pretty sure epics don‚Äôt affect your legendary chance, only Mythics and Legendaries
---
How else do they need to change him? They just did an overall to his star power and buffed his damage. Just because he‚Äôs not OP at one mode doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs bad
---
I hate this map so much, your basically forced to use bull or shelly to win if ur not lucky
---
No but it says in the description for the custom game that all brawlers will be max
---
they do. frank did mine by alot
---
No. I'm entertained to find out people are so butthurt because I'm calling out their favorite alt-right pseudo intellectual.
---
r/woooosh
---
It's a mobile game if you want quality you're setting yourself up for disappointment.
---
Ah ok thanks, makes sense
---
Pure gold ü§£
---
I mean he does have the unique mechanic that no one else in the game does that he can self pass without super. 
---
i agree     i think you will find someone said what is wrong if they donating the best game ever ShAme On YoU 
---
Thanks)
---
Bro chill I didn‚Äôt make the meme political at all. It‚Äôs a meme not a statement. 
---
Brawlstars has been a quality game thus far. Let's keep it like that.
---
I'm pretty sure that custom games dont have maxed brawlers anymore
---
I never used reddit in my life, and only created an account just for this: Why the Bo star power nerf? 
---
I've dedicated my entire brawl stars career on Bo, buying offers from the shop to get power points for him, all the time. The day I'm lv. 9 is the day this stupid update comes out. Now, as a lv. 10, I can't see around much. It doesn't give an advantage on bushy maps anymore. A shelly can overpower me, and that's not what's supposed to happen. Please fix it to at least a minimum of 5 tiles, I'll accept and live with. Now idk what to do with my life cuz I have nothing that my other brawlers can replace my time and dedication for Bo. I can't see very well, and my arrows travel further than what I can see within bushes. That don't make sense. Bo is not a close range shotgun player. FIX IT. I can't accept. 
---
Y'all get me or am I yelling at a wall of text?
---
üòò
---
Because they‚Äôve supported the game since beta launch in 2017. Because they help promote the game. Because they‚Äôve spent lots of money on the game. If you want a skin you gotta buy gems or save up gems. You‚Äôre lucky supercell was nice enough to give away 2 free skins

time for bush camping
---
Throw bomb at feet
---
What a come back! Thanks for sharing! 
---
This is a side comment. anyone reply working? Says in game I need 400 trophies but I have 4 k. Is it still disabled?
---
Teaming is normal 
---
soy sauce actually. calamari is squid not a sauce
---
That not true because mortis would just get three shot by Bull from long range, not even in short range.
---
Bull camp in middle to win
---
Chances are still pretty low.  It‚Äôd be lucky if you got him.  I have 250 normal boxes, 10 big boxes, and 3 mega boxes saved and I‚Äôm still not counting on it.
---
thing is they like teaming if its necessary like 2 low power cubes bull against 1 high power cube bull but they do not like when its like huge teams of like 8
---
?
---
yeah i got piper brock and jessie to 500 on the day life leech came out, im sad now
---
they shifted the meta which i thought was kinda cool. 
---
Between the Dynamikes and Barleys teaming behind the walls, the Bulls and Shellys running rampant in the bush, and the Ricochets picking off stragglers on the outside, the map is one giant, glorified meme.
---
you need 400 trophies on one brawler in the match, either on your team or the opponent team.
---
No one plays showdown high level, if they do it's filled with teamers and they get like 2 for first but -9 for last or whatever
---
Mike is good on this map wdym
---
same
---
b·èíuh
---
His super shoots  pink/red hearts and looks sick, especially when the regular super shoots green music
---
So true... I used to main Mortis but now he is just so useless :(
---
can ppl actually get it out of the water?
---
hold the fuck up
---
I got nothing.
---
Theres a difference between 2 brawlers targeting a stronger brawler, and 2 brawlers coming together and going around killing everyone else.
---
Very cute! Nice job :))
---
No hat mortis was first to die... COINCIDENCE??? I THINK NOTTT!!
---
Hahhaaahaha yeah......lol
---
Thats awesome!!
---
Understandable, I typically did the same when I was playing a 'low' tier brawler
---
That is such a good value!
---
I found mine from top local, and they seemed really nice. It‚Äôs been a year and we‚Äôve moved up 20 spots, made a feeder (Icy Tribelets) and I‚Äôm a co for the clan. Best decision I ever made. I‚Äôd suggest if you have any brawl stars ig friends, join em! Otherwise, we are more than welcome to accept you in our clan! Best of luck!
---
I've been blessed by the mighty free big box :D
---
Where do you see the drop rate %?
---
This is why Shelly‚Äôs super is overpowered.
---
In my opinion, at least. I dunno about the rest of you.
---
Aight, I'll check out Pat's vid, thanks fam
---
No no
---
I am not saying that. 
---
All i am saying is why does unlocking epic affect legendary's odds !!!!
---
Yeah I know right !
---
I think GENE can pull this off.....may be he can..ü§îü§îü§®ü§®
---
Yes
---
Every time this map comes into rotation I just want to stop playing 
---
It‚Äôs not bad, but I agree with other comments needs few bushes, and has some really strong choke points for throwers and bo 
---
I think this is honestly the best solution, bring back and make life leech more frequent so that both sides can be happy
---
NO you Po Po
---
Morris also won
---
Nothing special. Looks like a typical dynamike game. He's probably the best character in the game right now for showdown.
---
Teaming itself is more toxic than backstabbing. 
---
True but if you  weaken them enough and get back outta there, more often than not they backstab. Maybe this is at higher trophy level tho, as I'm at 9.6k. 
---
Go to the mega box in the shop and tap the ‚Äúi‚Äù in the top left corner. 
---
Unlocking brawlers lowers your chances of unlocking more
---
In 2 weeks they said in the vid gene is coming mid February  
---
Oh god, why is this actually too relatable. This brings back such a huge part of my childhood. Once we became the advanced thinking 8 year olds I remembered we‚Äôd always have a long broom ready to knock it out from under the car. Thank you for the memories OP.

---
There is literally a post 2 below yours.

Yea ..  i got all of em in just 2 weeks

why would he report it?..... 
---
how do you not know why? are you even 13? 
---
No
---
Mine crashes during a game, never has when loading
---
How? Lv 5? This has to be photoshop lol
---
congrats
---
they could make 100 gold cost 180 gems and that would still make it x3. it doesn't matter what the original shop packs are to see if it's worth it or not. 
---
PRESS READY OR I WILL SHOOT YOU
---
There's a difference between not caring and refusing to see the facts 
---

"look man we already gave you a buff that makes you very good in every mode, a skin and a loving community what more do you want?"

How to beat 3 stooges + evil twin + loan shark
---
Of course skin. Chance to get something good from box is very small, but when you buy skin you always know what you will get, and if you like Bull, buy skin. Else, wait for another, there will be many other skins
---
Not enough gems for the mega box tho..
---
the old brawl ball is where we spawn at the sides
---
I put my dong in teamers mouth bruh. Youre a dong sucker for teaming.
---
It would change solo showdown, because then you cannot see what kind of brawler the enemy is using.
---
the skin is good offer? i was thinking that the skin is just a skin 
---
Lmao all I do is tell you the logic behind teaming and you instantly become aggressive. Go get a life. And for the record, I don't team. 
---
Also Gene 
---
No. This would make star powers wayyyyy too overpowered. I think you're missing the point of star powers. They're not meant to give you a direct advantage over opponents. They're unique abilities for each brawler that slightly changes the way they're meant to be played. Any more OP and you'll see this game become Clash Royale 2: a p2w game.
---
I said that he has very big damage and hp, and he literally in every showdown has top 1-3, in the end of game are 1-2 Bulls, Shelly or Primo and sometimes another charecters.
---
He is op
---
She is only good to sucks enemies lol
---
It could change some of the tactic of the game from camping to looking around what brawlers are around. 
---
Damn man spamming the autoaim ain't gonna make it reload faster 
---
No refunds
---
Smh Jeremy 
---
So creative! Haha
---
It could make people look around who are they facing.
---
smh tork
---
Draws in bounty do happen relatively often, along with brawl ball.
---
AHAAHAHAHHAHA SO FUNNY, noobs say bull is Op lmaoo
---
Ok 
---
But i like to see if my teammate killed that Primo with all the gems or if they just die against a Jessie. 
---
Same
---
It is annoying when your solo kicking two teamers asses, and then another pair of teamers comes up and kills you. Like I was already beating the odds and then you gotta come take a shit in my fucking Cheerios.
---
I don‚Äôt usually team just when there‚Äôs another team I know I can‚Äôt defeat alone, also I don‚Äôt see something wrong with teaming because showdown based on hunger games and in the movies they co operate too. And brawl stars team don‚Äôt see something wrong with that either they said it spice up the match ups.
---
"bull is op" nice joke. 
---
Bull is NOT op lmfao learn how to kite
---
Mini account, most likely by some Top player, plays with other Top players 3v3
---
How high is your brock rank? 
---
Whoa is that a new brawler??? Never seen that one before
---
The close range brawlers are only op in certain maps, namely those with grass and close range fights. 
---
Bull has crippling range but excellent damage, so you want to keep him at range. Don't even think about going close to him unless you're a shelly with a super. And even then your timing has to be excellent. And you need to learn just how far bull can charge, once you do you'll avoid most bulls.
---
Shelly is good at short range but rather poor at medium range. Her power lies in her super. As long as she has her super, be wary of clumping up or going close to her. Play far range and she'll be a sitting duck.
---
El Primo is good at doing a constant stream of damage. His health lets him get closer to many medium range brawlers and still have health to deal with them. His reload speed is blazing fast, so don't ever assume he won't hit you. His super is deadly to many mid-far range brawlers as he can close the gap instantly, but he can be easily death with if you have any of the brawlers above or stick together.
---
These 3 aren't op brawlers. If you have their counter they go down real quickly. Know their weaknesses and you'll win easily.
---
Draws in heist are where it's at
---
You're removing the entire reason it exists. If you want to go down this road you might as well remove it entirely. 
---
Vice for the club*
---
Meh
---
Hope it gets fixed soon
---
Same here, except with Mortis.
---
*hears shotgun blasts in the distance*
---
oh fuck
---
those are good at getting top 3 but also very likely to endup in bottom 3 . they do high damage at close range but can't do anything at far range.
---
But if he's lucky there are no bulls in those bushes and he can get those boxes
---
jk there will always be atleast 5 bulls in there
---
If you shook the field more then the ball would have rolled faster... YOUR FAULT! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Good Guy Gene
---
Crow was amazing as well
---
Cheerful ones 
---
Thank you guys for the fast answers ü§ò but it looks like crow is not my type of brawler :-l 
---
That's what I am doing.
---
*bass boosted distortion plays*
---
If you look further down my comments you‚Äôll see one
---
Nice (?) to see I'm not the only one. 
---
gold for money is crap. if you want gold with money , buy tickets with gems instead and get boxes  out of weekly events.
---
Look at my posts. Would you like more evidence? 
---
Rico isn‚Äôt that weak, he can kill a Shelly. Mike on the other hand, such slow attack. Or Piper...
---
I made a video about it.
---
Don't worry boys, the engineer is engi-here! HEHEHAHAU
---
yes, but he have so many hp that even big range charecters cant kill him before he leave
---
Yeah it help, thank you pal :)

The trick is exactly what the post said, but worse. ‚ÄúHey, use this base game function that everyone uses that has already been talked about.‚Äù And if you want to give a tip don‚Äôt make people ask for like three comments to get it
---
No, but he certainly feels slower aye.
---
There is an isue with the 2nd point: Mikes will start throwing their dynamites to the nearest brawler that is not another Mike or Barley.
---
if you want to fight one on one then nope you can't  . you have to stay away while shooting at them. they need the hp to chase the brawlers. 
---
They were bots. Don‚Äôt worry
---
So can primo with regular and Darryl with super
---
Well kinda, anyone can edit their trophy count in photoshop. And in the comments of that same post you said you lose 7 trophy‚Äôs when you‚Äôd lose and you gain two but multiple other people said that was false
---
in french is name is SuperBull
---
Nice bro Nice
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.

mid February 
---
I meant legendaries
---
Rinsing and repeating for a couple hours, You need to be patient though.
---
The first play of every game is a foot kicking a ball!
---
Why can you buy it for 5 gems
---
Uhm, and what when the barrels inside the little islands are destroyed and a Darryl/Piper/Primo/Bull get stuck into these spots? 
---
It's titled "Box Brawler", and you didn't say what gamemode it was for
---
r/blessedvideos
---
I had it already with pam in rockwall brawl on the north side of the map 
---
I am for
---
Loaded Rico should have AirPods
---
yup
---
This conversation is getting mixed up.
---
Yes, the vast majority of the world says football instead of soccer (or equivalent in their language).
---
But also the majority of the world knows the other sport as ‚ÄúAmerican Football‚Äù (or equivalent in their language).
---
So... Footbull, while perhaps an affront to World Cup enthusiasts, could still convey the proper meaning.
---
... it is right around double the population.
---
People like you gave no sence of humor and are useless in communities like these
---
Im a dirty gemer so i bought it lol
---
He‚Äôa comforting the player
---
Or with a hat
---
Yeah you're definitely getting him in your next box /s
---
No, they don't fall out
---
Yeah it's kinda weird that you spawn inside the goal in this map, it's like there wasn't any play testing at all with all these issues
---
100% sure, atleast not again in the next update  :)
---
-Primo-
---
-Barley-
---
I did it today.. am i a god?
---
Should be way less than four months average. You get:
---
* 2 boxes a day from regular tokens
---
* 1.2 boxes a day from star tokens
---
* Depending on your ranking, end of season rewards. At 9500+ I'm getting 660 tokens every two weeks, which is about 0.47 boxes per day
---
* Two free tickets every weekend, which are worth ~0.05 boxes a day, assuming you get max or almost max rewards in Robo Rumble with them
---
* Daily free item in the shop, which I would estimate to be around 0.5 boxes per day
---
* All the tickets and gems you get from your boxes. Boxes have a 25% chance to have at least one ticket.
---
* All the one-time rewards from level ups and brawler ranks
---
When you add all these up, you're getting at least five boxes per day, and much more if you're patient with your gems and only use them on good ticket and doubler deals.
---
With five boxes a day average time to get a mythic would be 80 days.
---
Hehe game up I get it
---
cool, but what is the bottle ? ( sprite, coke or of pepsi ) ?
---
Nice. 
---
So you are skilled
---
Oh I thoght you were talking about epics
---
Rip 
---
Play with friends man! Better strategy more win, don‚Äôt play with randoms :/
---
Keep brawling
---
There's no humor in this... this is in no way contreversial
---
Good idea
---
#NAGASAKI
---
1945*
---
Like that cat BTW :3
---
I never play solo showdown? That mode is a disgrace and unplayable above 400 trophies, under 400 people are that trash that u can easily destroy teamers. And no im not on low trophies im already on 6k on my second account. What im saying is that a guy that got his trophies through teaming is for sure less skilled than one who did not team and got them all playing solo the proper way :)
---
Really? Do the c use bycicler to get around the field? 
---
Just played cavern churn and in the first game were no bos, but in the next one was a team of 5 maxed bos
---
I think it's too luxury. This is much harder to do and if it's be add the price for skin will be higher. It doesn't take much effort to just paint the rockets with flame in gold. Think about it
---
Maybe change it to a bounty map?
---
I didnt laugh, my friend is here. He didnt laugh too
---
The object of the game is to survive not to get kills
---
That will be mid febuary u idiotüòÇ
---
true
---
These need to be able to translate to different languages.  While the puns may be fun in English; there‚Äôs no way they would translate correctly into other languages. 
---
teaming in robo rumble 
---
Bros till the end
---
I think they are pretty balanced, but Colt can be max 50 imo. The others are worth the price
---
Ok thansk
---
probably not this in English cuz copyright. cld be wrong.
---
Word soccer comes from Great Britan, where they invented that word for football, because americans started to use the same word for their handegg
---
Are you mentally challenged? Lunar Event is on 5th February...
---
Yeah, the two others are definetly worth it.
---
Exactly my point I want to know if any one would happen to know the exact date maybe data miners or someone 
---
I got tara today
---
No dude haha, just saying that many people asked this before nothing else
---
#ALAHU AKBAR
---
Brawl Blasters. 350K+ total trophies and 10th of Belgium
---
im going... dynamike
---
Same, when people spin to team with me, I kill them and then I spin hoping it enrages them ^^
---
It does matter because some people want to buy the lunar new year pack but also want to wait until Gene comes out. 
---
I know everyone hates that this happens, but when 3 players with high trophy counts all join a team and do matches together,  they have very little chance of finding a matchup close to theirs. And it would be unfair to make those players who worked for all those trophies to either wait minutes to find a match or not let them play at all. 
---
New Mortis buff confirmed 
---
Shooting the ball on water is three times worse than cornering
---
so does Bo
---
Ok thanks for the info^-^
---
It ends in 12 days. That‚Äôs not February the 5th. 
---
with of the drugs ?
---
deception 100
---
Well hes going to be released mid February and the official Chinese Lunar event will be on 5th February this year :)
---
So we dont know if people will be able to buy the pack after gene has been released...
---
Cause you can kill everybody at the same time ? 
---
I‚Äôm from Canada but now live in Africa. 
---
Canuckleheads, Yankees and Aussies call it Soccer ‚öΩÔ∏è but the rest of the world calls it football. If I say soccer here people will look at me strangely. 
---
People call it ‚ÄúAmerican Football‚Äù üèà here when referring to the NFL. Although it‚Äôs not popular. The NFL is of course extremely popular in Canada üá®üá¶ and in the USA üá∫üá∏. 
---
Anyways. Supercell is Finnish and the devs probably preferred calling Bull‚Äôs new skin, Touchdown Bull instead of ‚ÄúFoot-Bull‚Äù because a lot of players would be confused. 
---
It's up there for sure
---
Oh ok
---
That's cause you ain't high trophy, when you reach 400+ it's like that every game ! You got 8 throwers making 1 or 2 teams Everytime.
---
Most Canucks üá®üá¶ and Yanks üá∫üá∏ call it ‚Äútossing the ole pigskin...‚Äù
---
Lunar event ends in 14 days so i said i think he will come when lunar ends. So shut up now please
---
Dude the official Chinese Lunar New Years is on the 5th February
---
Sure, [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/BrawlStarVN/permalink/359391124648233/) is the link. Remember that this is a closed Facebook group so you have to request to join the group in order to see the original source. And this group is Vietnamese-only.
---
You mean the event we currently having ?
---
This interaction doesn't work anymore btw. I think he should get his old 300 damage back, Colt and Ricochet already got it so why not? His SP needs to be buffed/changed imo, I just got him to Level 10 and I don't feel a difference.
---
Remodel would be nice too.
---
It‚Äôs the opposite of cavern churn, bull is op at the beginning but really bad at the end, the long range dude start to thrive in the middle.
---
Thanks for your art post! If you are not the creator of this work, please make sure that you have included the source, or to  comment it here! Unsourced art may be removed if you are not the creator.
---
yea that would be great
---
it seems my Leon OP controls having taking control by themselves and win the game for me... are you telling me i have to.. play?
---
IKR right?
---
Repost alert
---
they probably only push together
---
No we don't need more objects in boxes, that will make getting the important stuff harder so thats literally retarded :)
---
Ikr stands for "I know, right?" You don't need to add it again.
---
Just max them?
---
Love this idea !
---
It's already there
---
I knew that... totally
---
I did
---
but it's the best skin
---
definitely the reskin hype
---
I was hoping to get at least Tara, but got nothing.
---
Can‚Äôt complain since I already have Mortis and crow
---
I acc did, I was just messing
---
No. Skins rotate in shop and you get deals on all skins eventually. Not a glitch. 
---
Thank you! Same here,doesn't like map with large amounts of bush.
---
The Colt doesn't look that different. Rockstar Colt is much better price for what you get. But Agent Colt will be super Rare after the event is done (like the Brawliday skins)
---
Dine-a-mike and dynamike sound the same though. Might get a little confusing.
---
Yes. They‚Äôre cool 
---
A tip from someone with 11k and 6k trophies, don't play this disgraceful mode if you're brawler is above 300 Trophies, u wont have fun :)
---
Yeah this is a very nice idea
---
But isnt it unfair for me a 8k trophy guy to play against 3 top tier ppl? Its not like theres no one q-ing with 600-700 trophies right?
---
Wont happen, id rather carry some noobs than wait 10min for a game
---
This is probably one of the randoms I lose with all time... run and gun with 10 gems üòÇ
---
&gt;If you spawn on the right side of the map your camera angle will face the center of the map, that‚Äôs how.
---
So like a 90¬∞ angle relative to the people below/above you.
---
Now, if our phones were squares, that‚Äôd work, but they aren‚Äôt. Hence all these problems. 
---
This would create the same problem, but much worse.
---
&gt; And In duo it doesn‚Äôt really matter because there isn‚Äôt as big of a punishment for dying since you have a teammate
---
Uhm, what??
---
that doesn‚Äôt mean at all that we should not care then wether the game is fair or not in terms of getting kills. 
---
And also how is this less of a problem is solo when there‚Äôs 2x more starting points who‚Äôd all need different angles to face the center. 
---
I actually never had a successful team in solo and only once saw it that it worked for others every other time I got killed or someone in the team I saw.
---
All my brawlers are above 300 and I play Showdown 90% of the time (also I like to play Bounty, Heist, and HATE Gem Grab and Brawl Soccer).
---
I love to play Duo Showdown, even when I finish at 5, because it is so so so so funny...
---
Play him in island invasion, just go in the middle and shoot EVERYONE that try to approach you.. I got him to over 400 this way.. (you can also team in the middle with someone to get control of the map, but that‚Äôs on you) 
---
‚ÄòSave Dynabird‚Äô
---
Yea xD
---
Short Circuit and the Rescue Ranger (Jessie's healing ability at level 10), along with the Jag would be a pretty good copy of her.
---
I prefer his normal skin to this one tbh
---
But maybe I‚Äôm weird
---
Me too, playing @ s9
---
Ofc he can be played in heist, that doesn't mean he is good compared to any other brawlers in heist. You are not a genius by placing traps around chest, his super is mostly a defensive super. What else are you supposed to do?  Is your bo maxed? If not you don't really understand
---
Life struggles.
---
Overused 
---
Not everyone. A football ‚öΩÔ∏è is this everywhere else in the world. This is an American football üèà outside of North America 
---
mY nAmE bArLeY
---
I do, works pretty well.
---
Sounds like you just want to have to put in no effort and get easy wins. Well news flash, that's not how this works. The skilled climb, the lazy and incompetent don't
---
I am curious
---
That was before the nerf. I can imagine island invasion being even worse than cavern churn with 5 bulls rushing to middle. Sure you could kill one of them but you won't see the other coming next to you
---
Come on cat get out of the way
---
Reeee
---
I have no epics and I was hoping for at least 1 in mine because I had a good chance but nothing 
---
disk in,

Yeah same with me, what iPhone are you using? 
---
Just for curiosity 
---
I am at 9k trophies with all maxed brawlers, yeah I am just "lazy". Shoot at bushes in cavern churn mid LOL
---
‚âßœâ‚â¶
---
Lol bo is really strong 
---
exactly
---
Still important for someone who play casual 
---
Bro el edgy is the worst skin in the game pls uninstall
---
Never happened to me honestly but yes i think ut could happen.. idk maybe I‚Äôm good with him but for me it‚Äôs working great even after his nerf.. and also, he‚Äôs power 5. Btw Bulls tend to get scared so easily, so if you land at lest 3 shots on them, they just run away.. 
---
Nope, not on Cavern Church. Unless i have my super ready #LEONBORGHINI
---
Bo is very strong. Play him in something other than showdown maybe
---
(ÔΩ°&gt;Ôπè&lt;ÔΩ°)
---
Yeah, so that's still a football. And they call the sport American football so the name footbull would still make sense.
---
I mean, the game can‚Äôt just leave you stuck on water...

Than stop being a f**king dick! Every Rico fkn targets me 0.001 seconds after the game starts
---
How I cry everytime a 8 gem primo supers into the enemy spawn 
---
Daaang this is great! How close or what kind of close do you consider Leon and Nita?
---
The picture is bad
---
Boss battle map? Or weird 5v7 showdown map
---
Haha, I don't have any, but maybe we just have different views. I play League of Legends a lot and I find that to be more skill-inducive than BS. That being said, Brawl is still fun when I have some downtime.
---
Ouch, you hurt me ;'(
---
Well if you use your brain maybe you can figure out what it says
---
Never claimed to be a genius, just pointing out how effective he is in a game mode you claimed he sucked in. 
---
As for what else are you supposed to do - try shooting other brawlers or their safe. I find that's a pretty effective method of playing.
---
Nice /r/gatekeeping btw.
---
IT is cuz the device can't handle the new graphics.
---
&gt;Nice job on the balancing supercell
---
There are nothing they can do, it's hard to find another three 900 trophies players to pair up with them
---
I don't think spike could frown, even if he wanted to. 
---
there was a boss bot once. but only ONCE ü§î
---
Congrats! Basically just what u/Genser1c said. My mistake when playing Crow for the first time was that I went too aggressively. You don't have that much burst, so you have to stay away and poke enemies until they have maybe 1000 health. If you are close enough, you can deal that much damage in one shot, because all three of your daggers will hit. Also, (this should be common sense but I'll say it anyway) NEVER fight a Bull or El Primo or Shelly in close combat until you have far more powercubes than them. And, when playing showdown, if someone harasses you and tries to steal your chests, let them do it. Don't fight for them cause you will most likely lose. 
---
It‚Äôs a game and it‚Äôs fun. Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt take it so seriously. Or learn the rules.
---
Btw colt skin is trash cus 150 for that skin oof.  I am only buying cus it is limited
---
Why would it go down?
---
Thanks
---
Dear developers of the game Brawl Starts. How do I get a gift from you in the form of a skin. You gave some people. Why is this connected?
---
How is that not fair lol. These people are working to create content for us and you don't think they deserve to play a skin a few days before us? 
---
Same, I got him real early at 650 trophies 
---
Lucky. I just got Frank from it
---
They still do, but just when you play with an other player 
---
I‚Äôm not supercell; I‚Äôm a nobody in all fairness, but I‚Äôll share my thoughts anyway. Next year‚Äôs holiday skins will probably be different brawlers. If you purchased Red Nose Nita, Santamike or Lil‚Äô Helper Penny, it would only make sense that they would remain legacy skins. 
---
No. Probably not. Don't get too excited, this wasn't the update that includes Gene. Maybe it adds some of the new maps. 
---
I just got Tara from a friggin brawl box
---
1 Rico (obviously)
---
3 Bulls (obviously)
---
Let's just assume that bo is "good" in heist, that y r u arguing with op when u don't have bo's star power. 
---
piper...
---
more like piper perry ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
the progress bar goes from one to 50 very fast, then to 81, and take forever to get to 100
---
Why do Bulls use the super for attacking
---
Brock has 4, and 1 empty slot
---
It's intentional. If u want maxed brawlers and bots, another player has to join you. 
---
its a joke btw
---
Is Leon the most appreciated character on this sub? Or does that go to Paco?
---
Oh and good job OP
---
Damn this luck 
---
Once again for the cheap seats....
---
He asked me how Bo was good in heist, I answered. You've just made the same assertion.
---
Cheers.
---
I know I will never get a new brawler so I don‚Äôt expect it
---
That‚Äôs what he just explained 
---
I‚Äôm not sure about the big box but the normal one only gives you the brawler
---
I don't think it's overlooked cause i already seen like 20 posts about it
---
I hate Mortis. 
---
rico super...
---
What's the original meme ?
---
Damn. Congrats. Although I don't wanna know how small your luck value is now. 
---
i play only in showdown bcoz i dont have any friends (lmao üòû) to play with them in 3v3s and i cant rely on randoms. i dont team tho xD
---
If your logged into supercell id, you can log out to make a new account. Log back in to supercell id to switch between the accounts. They will both save upon logging in and out. 
---
Leon prenerf was basically Meta Knight from Smash Brawl. 
---
Thanks for the info!
---
(Also means I will never be able to do that cuz I have no friends lol)
---
If u see that the number "items left" is golden, like it is when you have a bonus, then you know it's a brawler. 
---
I am preparin 2 more for Penny and Jessie üòâüëÄ
---
And then Mike swoops in for the kill
---
In big box it can be anytime when it says 3 items but most of the time its not, a mormal brawl box gives you a brawler automatically(no power points and coins) and mega box needs to say 6 items remaining that means youre getting a new brawler
---
I was being sarcastic 
---
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/piper-perri-surrounded This.
---
Yes it is. Download parallel space or any other app that allows you to clone apps.
---
N once again, you're the one which started an irrelevant conversation to op's post. 
---
We found the dynamike teamer guys
---
Well, that's what you can expect if you play on these maps. 
---
Why the fuck does this have -6 votes
---
You caught me lol
---
Why would it need to directly translate?  Is someone in Korea going to look at ‚ÄúFootbull‚Äù and say ‚ÄúNo!  That‚Äôs not his name!‚Äù
---
Now we need a piper one.
---
Because it's random and doesn't make sense
---
Wait whats your legendary odds
---
How not?? Join to a band!! Man you have to play with someone ! :)
---
The only mode they need to remove and replace it with something more original is Showdown
---
No on so many levels
---
They hated jesus because he told them the truth
---
no.. its a silhouette of a genie
---
Finally someone makes a post!
---
No it s the classic image of a gene. They didn t knew it was like this
---
T H I C C O M O D E
---
Mr 1up char por i am waiting
---
If your max rarity is epic than you shouldn‚Äôt have a mini lol
---
Like it!
---
Gonna be removed.
---
And then I slam my head into a wall
---
??? You special people are talking about him and i haven't seen him in action 
---
It fits and it‚Äôs a football skin 
---
Hmmm....
---
oo nice:)
---
perfect reason to never auto aim a super
---
And cheaper. Brock is ok, but not worth 150
---
be just like cavern churn. never play, not even for the star key
---
Stay away from 3v3.. 
---
as much as I like 3v3 modes I don‚Äôt play more than my star token unfortunately cause it‚Äôs trash with those teammates.. 
---
Plus I don‚Äôt wanna break my phone yet üòã
---
I was about to say that it has inspiration from a swastika
---
They do with maps, but honestly can you blame them? I've seen at least three different football Bull skins on here, which one do you credit? And should they also credit our skin suggestions even if they came up with a similar idea themselves?
---
Or FootBull if the English don't get their weenies in a knot over it.
---
1 tip: spin
---
I think the key issue here is that the company is European. They do a good job in general at localization but they could probably use someone for idioms and puns in each culture. Not the hugest deal but as we can all see they're missing out on some good opportunities lol
---
Auto aim colt
---
will you ever re-nake this map?
---
That‚Äôs epic
---
I don‚Äôt see the difference
---
Okay but like
---
This is Rico's map
---
This is the only way Rico mains can get cups
---
And it's also one of the funner maps in my opinion, the fact that the whole center of the map is covered in bushes makes the pulse pounding final moments even more intense. Of course, Bull Bush Camping is a problem in this map, but it is also a problem on /every/ map with bushes. I think this map is unique and doesn't deserve to die...
---
I think discussing whether it should or should not be in the game is a different topic than shitting on players who use it.
---
This has been totally solved. Yay Supercell! 
---
Hi
---
I didn't say that its not true
---
I just said hmm
---
Because I wasn't sure 
---
Don't assume 
---
I don't have high geographical knowledge 
---
Long lived the King
---
Don't speak Pretzel
---
I really dont care how bad they are but the chances of getting 2 brawlers in one box and having them as the top 2 rarities 
---
Lmao he's also saying "ready"
---
Smack me!!!
---
CUTE
---
Rekt 
---
I didn‚Äôt say to do that lol, I said that there needs to be a change, I didn‚Äôt say what change. Thank you 
---
Oh this game still exists
---
Yeah me too
---
No she‚Äôs good but doesn‚Äôt do enough damage 
---
Congratulations, you have entered the 1%
---
Oh god not again
---
Thank You so much üòä
---
You went offline
---
You must be new here, they‚Äôre both shotgunners genius
---
Or SuperBULL
---
For original layout I had for the map, the center had fencing in it so it was like a square, but sadly I had to remove it since it had to have the bounty star in the center.
---
you should all keep in mind you're most likely playing with children. 
---
In fact duplicate system was fair enough
---
Looks cool!
---
Is that confirmed?
---
Same here. Support is useless, said ‚Äúmake sure no other apps running, and try to uninstall/reinstall‚Äù
---
Why , he literally can't do anything , he's only decently good at getting gems at the start of the match or brawl ball and he can't kill anything unless they are almost dead and even then he might die getting close to them
---
I like how when I talk about an issue, I get downvoted but when somebody else talks about it, front page
---
Yea, but I tried to make it to where there is places you could hide from projectiles from brawlers like Penny and Piper.
---
That meander your very skilled
---
What its the next Brawler you whant to see at the future with this theme???? ü§îü§îü§î
---
Tell me at comments
---
No model of spike has ever worn socks but it was still in the game before 
---
Whoa whoa whoa, you‚Äôre not supposed to max an F2P account in 3 months 
---
Darryl.mp4
---
It started today, a couple of hours ago
---
I now genius, but before nobody used Darryl, Bull has a higher rate usage but now everyone uses Darryl because of the buff, sorry you‚Äôre too smart I need to explain the joke 
---
Buy tickets

His feet are cold

My Brawl Stars career
---
Unlocks all rares (easy)
---
Unlocks all super rares (easy)
---
Unlocks all epics (easy)
---
Unlocks all mythics (easy)
---
Unlocks all... MOTHERFFFFFUUU...
---
Fucc u I have even more trophy's and 12 Brawlers, no epics mythical or legendary whatsoever
---
What if bot spawn each side 
---
If  they kill someone it will count for other team....
---
What I've been saying is that while the ball is on the water its direction can be influenced by players basic attacks making it an interesting game mechanic instead of a trap.
---
Lol I truly wish it was a lie 
---
Lol I played with him 2!
---
Yeah US is a country and Europe is many, why is that funny? 
---
Max bo‚Äôs wet dream
---
Yep
---
US should NOT be compared to europe in terms of size
---
Hell nahh I want her really bad too but she ain't worth it
---
How much trophies do you have
---
Lol yeah... One guy said you'll get a legendary in 2 months, but I got my first after 7. Still no mythic...
---
7.5k
---
Wait how are you playing with him.
---
I was hopping for crash fix
---
Foot-bull
---
Nope it does, superbull / superbowl but the community doesn't really like donghoon cuz he's dumb so it makes sense
---
In french he's called superbull
---
The post isnt about me its a joke üôÑü§®üòÜ
---
Not worth it, save that gems when gene comes out
---
Any ideas for ability‚Äôs?
---
It‚Äôs so you can play against your friends fairly.
---
i didnt get an update and i still get crashes?
---
Won't be enough 
---
Looks like I'm gonna pass on this offer. Thanks guys. 
---
When you play duo and are matched with a bull, then there are just two teams alive and you kill one of the other team and hit the other, but you die, then you think the surviving one is low health so the bull wins, but he tries to kill them with his super and they just walk a bit to the side and he doesn't hit him and goes into the poison and dies Àö‚úß‚Çä‚Åé‚ùù·∑Ä‡∫ª‡ΩΩ‚âÄÀçÃÆ‚ÄÜ‚ùù·∑Ä‡∫ª‡ΩΩ‚Åé‚Å∫À≥‚úß‡ºö

I hate these kinds of posts because i don't have this luck

I've made a post on how to do it without friends https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/am6l1s/bs_glitch_i_dont_know_if_anybody_else_knew_this/?utm_source=reddit-android

Not a chance ur the only one

So true
---
I did but i had the exit button and max health 
---
your colt was same health
---
Bullbowl
---
I do not like this skin and surely would not buy it but majorly respect your creativity and originality. still up voted based on those 
---
That sucks, it would be a lot more convenient if gene came out when you had that offer 
---
That's the dumbest thing I've read today.  The European union gets compared to countries like the US and China all the time. It's a union of many countries, being compared to one, and it's not done as a joke.
---
me too
---
Thank you for the opinion. üòâ
---
Still europe is a CONTINENT 
---
The dude was auto-aiming everything. Hitting 1 dagger on every target.

Usually i'm also very u lucky with all crate and stuff like that

Nice. I would name it thousand lakes version 2

Nice, now even people like me, who don't have friends can do it

New brawl stars merch coming soon lol

You will get hime one day

Yes and I hate it...Like really have a day off mate...

No sir.

Before glitch - 3360

After glitch - 3920

And once i got the exit button but is very hard.

Same here

Thanks for the credit! I really appreciate it! Again, great map

So what

&gt;Real females exist..just saying.

;--;

Wholesome

I opened a support ticket, SC said they are aware of this bug and are working on it
---
Its like comparing north America to Japan
---
No lex said that they used that picture from google to imagine genie brawler
---
Break the wall with dyna super 
---
He killed all but one brawler. The Jessie did nothing to help
---
Why is the video lagging?
---
Nice, hope it‚Äôs fixed soon so I have friends ;)
---
Seriously we‚Äôre goin this low? I think I‚Äôd still like the idea of my skin being in a game this big. The OP of the idea is fine with it anyways so why bother. 
---
I‚Äôd name it wilted wasteland. But there‚Äôs probably a better name
---
there is XML code you can use when entering your name

Implement voice chat so I can scream into my phone

Change it

Wow that's actually good! 'Wilted wasteland'

android got an update for this im confused

You must be happy ü§î
---
I know right? It seems like every solo I play half the roster is bull, I‚Äôm not trying to be that guy and say nerf bull cause it‚Äôd affect his performance in higher trophies or other game modes but it‚Äôs rough to cling trophies with a different brawler
---
I do this so much as well, usually try helping brawlers getting teamed on 
---
no mortis was way better before
---
California has the 5th biggest economy in the world. It's a US state being compared to other countries, by your logic this is a stupid statement too 
---
Nou ja...
---
Yeah thats because of auto aim and they just walk and spak auto aim with bull then they think they are such a pro!!!
---
I hope so...
---
May be your device cause i don't see lag in it.
---
I have been waiting for someone to post this lmao! 
---
If you took the time to Google search like I suggested earlier, you'd find many articles comparing the US to Europe, especially the EU. 
---
Not anymore

I got my crow the day after my leon, I dont see spike in my near future.

save them for gene offer

Excuse me ?!?! What the fuck ?!

NERF LEON

I have an iPhone 7 unfortunately

Disagree. I think the new ones, both, Rico and Barley and better. I would never put the old ones as profile icons, the new ones... I already did.
---
But only my opinion anyway.
---
The only old icons that I think it's better. Its Shelly and Jessie's

Here in the USA the lunar pack only cost 10 dollars, I bought it

So does the super act as sort of a grab? Because I‚Äôm that case I think it‚Äôs a little too similar to Gene‚Äôs super. His star seems busted in solo Showdown and pretty terrible everywhere else. 
---
not at all but okay
---
It's a giant target, what do you expect?
---
Then most teamers are dumb af.
---
U don't need  to team always bc u can backstabb

Actually that's great

Which message ? And i'm not using this API frequently so i can't answer, sorry...
---
‚ÄúAnd then, Jesus ressurected‚Äù

FRANK THE BUILDER
---
Yes if supercell would remove autoaim people vould then ACCTUALY learn the game, by the autoaim way they can just play shelly/bull/primo and its gg for them
---
Maybe
---
Just got my 5000 mega box today and the contents were worse than what you got excluding the new brawlers. I miss 5 brawlers and it's becoming hard to grow I'm fucking quitting
---
I feel like i fuck up my super like once a week as bull by running the wrong way lmaoooo
---
The morse code 
---
Thank youu &lt;3
---
When i get a new brawler i max them, so i could be level 10 with 0 trophies
---
I got Shelly, bull, ricochet, bo and dynamike to 500 on this map. No thank you
---
Aah, Thank youuu &lt;3 &lt;3
---
He got nerfd and congrats on your contribution to this post
---
.... And? I would love if they had a swedish or Japanese or Spanish pun. They don't NEED to do anything, they just maybe should if they want to have a diverse market. 
---
Thanks :D
---
300 trophy boi 
---
Ho no idk. I didn't request the API since my message concerning this messagz
---
BUT THE BULLS COME AND SPANK YER ASS
---
Those are all really good ideas thanks so much üôèüèº
---
Yes, Yesyesyesyes
---
Huh nice
---
Sorry, guess you missed my point. You are so low in cups you have lost literally nothing.  And there is almost 0 skill gap between brawlers from 0-300 cups.
---
Also this shit gets posted about 15 times a day on this sub.

Take it easy weirdo.

This is too pure to be angry about the teaming

Love replays omg

Maybe make it that you grapple towards the enemy

u/foenix000
---
DoNt Be LiKe BuLl
---
But most of the mortises here don‚Äôt have a hat
---
Sorry, guess you don't know jack about the game. You lose trophies as soon as you enter silver rank. Since you don't know what that is, its rank 5. 91 trophies is passed. That. Also, proving you know nothing about the game, it doesn't show trophies lost or gained on the defeat screen, it shows them once you hit proceed. Shit brains like you ruin games
---
The world will never know
---
Boss bot on this map is my fave
---
Oh shid. When I'm desperate i just camp with Bull.
---
A bush can be a guy wdym
---
Humor probably 
---
Yes you are. I prefer the newer one
---
Really? I didn't expect that :o
---
It's a game mode. One of the showdown events in slot 4
---
What
---
When you're in a 1v1 with a leon and you don't see him
---
If it‚Äôs not to much trouble I would love if you pointed out specific things you like about each head so I can combine all the best parts into a finished head.
---
Unfortunately it does. If by teaming they are utilizing the most effective strategy to win, we can‚Äôt really say they are doing anything wrong.
---
That's not how math works...
---
We all need to bull-eve that's not gonno happen üòî 
---
Definition of a backhanded compliment
---
I will probably make one, maybe after I make mortis
---
*Rank 1 Penny*
---
I know. I didn't say he had a bad voice. It really suits him.
---
Yeah but imagine getting teamed on all the  time and you see that.. a player protects another for no reason and kills you. It would be annoying.
---
No u
---
No you both
---
I got you
---
I do think I‚Äôm good at math, I passed high school with a 4.0 in math, and 10 x 1 is 10, and because of the fact that the regular brawl box is the lowest box you can get, it therefore implies that it is 1, and even if it isn‚Äôt, 10x(insert any number higher than zero here) would make the same thing, just with a different value. 
---
this is a problem but i dont really see a lot of people talking about it, and if they do they dont get a lot of attention
---
It should be but it isn't.
---
Agree with you both
---
Bull has joined the chat
---
Not to add fuel to the fire here but I got crow at around 900 trophies..
---
this would be great, i would also like to add people from showdown matches, i dont see why this isn't a feature
---
5
---
Like I said, this is a grammatical error. "As much" and "more" are different. More is building off of the original value. While as much is just multiplying. I'm proposing replacing "more" with "as much."
---
What do you mean, replays aren't in the game
---
1000000 what
---
hell yea!
---
Then kill him before he kills you. Had he killed the Jessie then he would have been just slightly more powerful. All but one person is going to die, may as well be you
---
phonecats op
---
I have been around for a while. What makes you say that he loves music? It definitely seems like it, but then why did they make the Boom Box Brock skin if that is already his personality.
---
Thing is, on the other maps where there's bush in the middle, bush is A LOT more smaller so there's less space to navigate AND the bush isn't surroundedby walls so you cannot constantly shoot at it. You have to be inside of it or you're dead (either way you die because bulls everywhere.) 
---
Shelly and rico only helps bulls to be #1 they can do absolutely nothing once safe area gets smaller only to reveal their locations and die instantly.
---
1000 coins 2 gem. 
---
'More than' means 'added to the base'. This essential difference is ignored by those who say that 'times' is dominant so that 'three times as much' is really the same as 'three times more than'
---
I wonder how many players who ‚Äúsign‚Äù this just don‚Äôt play the optimal brawlers for the map. Every map in the game caters to specific brawlers. In the case of cavern churn, bull, dyanmike, barley, and Rico are probably the best (don‚Äôt know about bo because I don‚Äôt have star power). That said, you don‚Äôt need to play those brawlers to have success. I‚Äôve pushed brawlers like poco on here and never had a problem. 
---
People hate it everyone hates it, and this is not 2011 its 2019 look at fortnites side of battle royale, if you team YOU WILL GET BANNED, thats the same thing that should be in brawl stars... no hate just my opinion
---
99% of BR players would disagree
---
God that would also be depressing too
---
lol
---
I‚Äôm not a pro but that shit op
---
Exactly, "more than" does mean "added to the base." If the base is 1, and we add 10 times that much, we get 11.
---
here its 14. i bought it
---
Holy crap Sub nice
---
*sorry for some translation errors;-;
---
Happens sometimes but very rarely
---
personal i really like the second !
---
This isn‚Äôt normal right? and if not, how did they do this?
---
100 healing per second is basically nothing but atleast you dont have to use ammo for it so it might not be the greatest star power but star powers shouldnt make a brawler great either 
---
Let‚Äôs meet in the middle and say 10.5
---
Cavern Churn is my favorite showdown map ;-;
---
Shaggy
---
1st*
---
Nobody cares
---
Get to 4000, then you can complain about luck and some people are just lucky, thats why after the game got global there were many posts about people who have under 1000 trophies and got a legendary and people who had the game since over a year didn't got any legendarys
---
im at 9400(pb 10236) without legendaries stop whining
---
If you‚Äôre trying to win every game then sure playing bull is the best way to do that, but if you‚Äôre just trying to get top 5, just staying out of the middle and controlling the engagements around you can be very effective. Bull is ineffective on the outside so you should only die to him in the middle anyway. 
---
I really don't want to argue anymore so I agree. 10.5 is the new multiplier on a mega box. üòÇ
---
I have tapped on it hoping it would do that!
---
Yeah, my phone‚Äôs almost dead
---
I agree
---
thanksüòÅ
---
That would break the game. 
---
100% accurate
---
idk.. I never had crashes
---
Well the shot gunners would still be able to shoot it and plus bull and Darrel could both roll or run onto the little island 
---
Yes please
---
Bo: confused screaming
---
i got 541 Tara power points. bought them
---
surprisingly brawl stars doesnt crash on my phone so its pretty nice but i've seen people in solo showdown who just stand there so i wait for them to come back cause i feel bad
---
Long range characters. Just shoot them and keep ur distance. When they pop out from a bush ur pretty screwed which is why everyone hates bush campers.
---
I mean, that's exactly why this map is badly designed. You should be able to win most of the time if you play good, luck should be a secondary factor. It is main factor in this map. If you have large quantites of crates besides you, you win.
---
Br porra

If you're playing on iOS, there is still no update so..

if ur name is rogergamers u deserve to lose

---
Do you look the image?
---
*A freaking 1 power box brock ended my 3 power box nita*
---
It was a brand new and different map when it first came out but it only caters to a few brawlers. A good map is one where many brawlers can be played and makes good use of the whole map. 
---
Cavern Churn Diversity: 1/5
---
Cavern Churn Gameplay: 3/5 (it‚Äôs a map that isn‚Äôt wide open like most which is different and nice, except it limits the places you can move around and has no wide open places, bad for long range)
---
Either needs to be reworked or removed from the game üìãüñä
---
I hate teamers, but this was wholesome.
---
You should be sappy

---
It looks way more detailed and fitting in contrast to the other icons. The new ricochet and barley ones look out of place due to the art style difference.
---
You ran into the single Shelly?
---
upvoted for the fact that this guy had the balls to make this pun and risk his karma
---
Yeah that bull didn't killed you with his super :/
---
Good point, although there's no bridge feature in the editor unfortunately.
---
impressing that u were able to take a screenshot
---
This is unusual... usually players that main a brawler like this have at least 50 solo sd wins.
---
Gotta give this guy props
---
Maybe they didn't see it but came up with the same idea?
---
I would also argue that Bo's icon has changed for the better, but yeah I agree with you for everything else
---
XD
---
I hate this map
---
Are you sure?
---
very happy i dont even have the mythics and im at 6k

too OP please dont

Maybe more boxes but otherwise amazing map

sicko mode
---
I mean they have to help you that's their job
---
Thanks!
---
Dont we all :D
---
I‚Äôd nut
---
Yeah but those who dont have legendaries on 9K still have at least one epic / mythic
---
i have literally none of those when my friends gets 3 in 2 weeks of time
---
Happy because I have no mtyhics and legendaries but all others

Jeez I certainly wouldn‚Äôt trade 30k coins for a measly 300 gems. Lol

There should be logs on your account that you have 15 box vaulted. Or that you opened 15box. Logs will tell. Ask support.
---
yes i looked at it....
---
Heh

Whag if you pushed 5000 with 1300 3v3 wins and only about 160 solo sd wins?

The head is missing...but yeah

wish there was a way to turn these off

What a spooky character.... he would fit so well on halloween
---
That‚Äôs why I wanted peoples opinions. LolüòÇWanted to use a reasonable number to see if for it to be viable in game how much it should really be. 
---
The people who aren't complaining likely have low trophies.  At higher trophies this is just a Bo's teaming in the middle party.
---
Ok but how much cooler is White Crow going to look? Should I buy him now?

Lol r/choosing beggar

There is nothing wrong

Everytime I play Brawl Stars and only Brawl Stars I get the same bug all the other 4.3 users have been having. This has been going on SINCR the game has released expect on the launch day, on which I stress that the game was working PERFECTLY FINE. Android 4.3 CAN support Brawl Stars, there is just the graphical bug that needs to be fixed.
---
i set my location to a random place and these guys were the lowest on the legendary leaderboards. thought id make some humor posts
---
Nah, it‚Äôs my least favorite tbh
---
The most satisfactory in the whole video is the small pause after Crow lands, where both players realise what has just occurred.
---
Yea but i mean all my friends at least have one legendary and here i am
---
But damn you are unlucky 
---
&gt; island invasion haas more bush
---
I am telling you that you cnanot escape huge amounts of bush in the middle, which you can easily do in island invasion.
---
&gt;So you want every showdown map to be same?
---
I want them more skill based than luck.
---
&gt;There's still strategy to when to open boxes
---
Ok? It is a lot lesser than what you can strategically do on other maps. In this map, you get blasted. In other maps, you can at least escape bush and focus on somewhere else of the map.
---
&gt;You can control your area and scout the bushws
---
And blasted to death in seconds because you cannot shoot to that blind spot?
---
&gt;Your last part can be for any map
---
It's just A LOT more common occurence in this map
---
Look, all we saying is, this map is a little more luck based than other maps, that's what we don't like about it.
---
CoC had the Healer Angel. CR had devs who listened to the community (lol nope). BS has Gene. 
---
We all need (emotional) support sometimes.
---
I guess that could work 
---
I've been drinking the wrong brand my entire life
---
That's a better but worst way to put it
---
Typical idiot that think it‚Äôs just: ‚Äúget better‚Äù. Ok dude, whatever you say üëåüèª
---
So... you should be happy
---
I wish it was like Clash Royale where it‚Äôs red or blue to show if it‚Äôs a friend or a random person.
---
Agree
---
F for u
---
There really isn‚Äôt a counter. Don‚Äôt take them all on by yourself. Wait it out and try to team with the other people. Pick them off one by one. If nothing works, accept your fate, camp, and get the highest place you can.
---
My only problem is how many Bulls appear whenever it‚Äôs in rotation and the obscene amounts of grass at mid.
---
Yea but my 
---
Legendary drop chances are low as heck
---
EUGENIO CRAB
---
Robo Bros
---
i dont think stun effects should be a thing, let alone this common on a brawler
---
*bushes start speaking bo and bull*
---
Literally no risk
---
I dont know what you were looking for but that‚Äôs it...
---
You have seen players get high trophies with power 1 right?
---
Same. All of my friends who play brawl stars are at 2000 trophies or below. Since they can't keep up with the skill level i just end up losing a bunch of trophies. So I just end up playing a lot of solo showdown.
---
I thought you were always maxed in friendlies?
---
Cool nota bro &lt;3
---
I noticed you‚Äôre low in trophies. Just keep playing and learning the strengths of each brawler and how to play them on the maps catered for them, that way you aren‚Äôt making ridiculous claims like ‚Äúit‚Äôs all luck.‚Äù
---
you can take a picture of your statues then just take a picture of the materials you use. Either I am being dense or you are doing this on purpose. 
---
Hey you can kill two birds with one stone

Big ricochet is best ricochet

contributing to what ruins the game? Cool

Dynamike has to learn that teaming isn‚Äôt good. His theoretical ‚Äúfriends‚Äù can betray him, even his bird!
---
i got him to 500 in solo showdown, just gotta be somewhat aggressive
---
LONG RANGED BTAWLERS!!!
---
Weird flex having Tara but ok. 
---
Nah, the brock one is the best
---
You're enjoying the new model over the old?
---
Hey thanks!
---
Ahhh yeah
---
Got Crow in that lunar offer. 
---
Yea, after the bock skin
---
It would be more like 100 coins for 50 gems, or even 100 for 25
---
Yeah, very nice argument. I think this discussion is now over.
---
But liek, why did they change Barleys icon tho?
---
Literally unplayable without it 
---
If you‚Äôre admitting you‚Äôre wrong then I guess it is üôÇ
---
I really hope that gets added like take my wallet supercell me want peon skin
---
yea
---
