That's like Disco Barley from GEDI KOR! It would be so good to have them in the new update since the theme is probably going to be Vapirwave/70s
---
Too relatable
---
pay attention to the spike and the crow's names
---
How i didnt notice that
---
*Did you get the star token?*
---

---
Yes.
---
*What did it cost?*
---
Everything.
---
I refuse to believe that this is a real match xD
---
üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

what the fuck am i looking at
---
Android and Mortis? ily
---
Why does this sound like a female anime character in my head ?
---
highly doubtful...
---
Looks like solo showdown.
---
Using his super!
---
üéµWe dont want Fraaanks on the lawn!üéµ
---
I agree. But there is a point to make about the chances of getting a legendary being too low. I'm not sure how accurate and can't remember the exact numbers, but Kairos Time did a video calculating that on average, you need more than a year of f2p BS to get all 3 legendaries. That's just BS imo.
---
No he says "oh you're so lucky"
---
all 4 of them suck on that map
---
r/tf2 is leaking

This design isn't my, is made by mu friend, the original desing is drawed for me, check my profile

Let's get this guy to 69 comments XD
---
K, I‚Äôm just saying, Piper is not good on the mode
---
who is the person on the right of the paper? I've never seen them before...
---
Why would you mess with a shotgunner on an energy drink map?!
---
üòÇüëè
---
nah they're all good
---
on that map?
---
Agreeable, I feel your pain Today I was playing Frank then I saw Piper and could easyly kill her buy then I started laggying and died RIP.
---
I was just waiting for the frank to unleash hell at the end. Love it
---
yes
---
oh you're right, then, which line did he swear
---
ok then whats the problem with the website lol
---
It‚Äôs too hard to open menu and invite people
---
Can confirm on that title, I live in America and I‚Äôm Mortis.
---
Loaded Rico is already thicc enough just follow his lead
---
oh.
---
No problem
---
 Carl eats rocks for breakfast, lunch and diner.
---
That's why he is detecting seismic activity all the time.
---
This is Gedi_Kor tier
---
What was bull about to do to the apple...
---
#*L E G A L*
---
Spike&gt;Crow confirmed
---
I don't think he does
---
38 trophies for everyone for participating! ... ...... i actually have no authority to declare that or dole out any trophies but know that i wanted to give them to u all...
---
lol that would be a fun heist map lol maybe not for big game solid 7/10
---
It happened only because bull suddenly stopped playing
---
RIP that one Shelley that didn't make it into the train.
---
I just need new brawlers from those boxes üòÖ. I reached around 8700+ trophies, no star power, missing 5 brawlers and the boxes are pretty much useless for me. All I get is 2 power token and less than 15 coins. Well, we gotta live with that I guess
---
This is a side comic ;)
---
Its alright
---
That might be true! Thanks for rating it!
---
Hahaha dying
---
Leon cool wait.. where is he?
---
This reminds me of the second rendition of the stat screen, the badges and crest in a way, very well done!
---
She needed a buff. She's bad is everything but showdown. Plus, she isn't even S Tier in Showdown. On the other hand, Piper has the same thing but for Bounty and she got a buff. No one's complaining because that was necessary, and same for Shelley. They both still suck hard and I'd like to see a rework.
---
Pew pew
---
It was an arguably good play. You guys could've just kept spinning around trying to kill each other but she took the quick way out. Based off your position, she coulve turned around and killed u with a normal shot but idk... If i were the shelly i wouldn't use my super.
---
***l i t***
---
He is just saying a reward would be neat
---
I love how he said "Mortis the Mortal" lmao
---
F
---
Username checks out.
---
r/rareinsults
---
This the type of stuff i'd love to see in my matchs üò≠
---
except none of them are actually funny, they put terrible, overused music over meaningless clips.
---
I‚Äôm not a F2P and still haven‚Äôt got one üòÖüòÖ
---
you get the obvious award
---
Isn‚Äôt rockabilly Mortis a 90‚Äôs ish skin?
---
Its disgusting brawls stars balance in match making, its literally fucking ridiculous, supercell should give more attention to this.
---
Relatable
---
Can't wait for the diss track
---
No ur not I have 7.2k trophies with all but Leon but I had the same brawlers at 5k btw I'm f2p
---
I remember when this map first came out the whole community freaked out about the grass lol. Those were the days.
---
Thank you for telling me
---
idk wether to downvote this or upvote this... heres a neutral!
---
I agree both with this idea and colt
---
don't make it a super rare. (1) there are already 4 super rares and this one would be the fifth and (2) this will make 4 robot super rares. i rest my case
---
(don't make it a robot we don't need 5)
---
Made with mematic
---
I do
---
That Frank guy was SUCHaJERK!
---
Darryl have the best view on piper
---
Did they rework it?
---
It‚Äôs a funny little touch that Mortis‚Äô name tag changes to ‚ÄúFUCK!!‚Äù in the panel where Colt crashes in through the ceiling.
---
Same with piper, 480 and now it‚Äôs at 413
---
it's beautiful
---
THOSE BASTARDS EVEN USED THE SAME GAME MODE NAMES
---
Anymore characters?
---
Helloooooo
---
Literally, this is 100% pure effort, but I prefer that Leon next to Shelly :D
---
I‚Äôm going to be real, I‚Äôve never even noticed that lol.  Probably would‚Äôve been smart to do that for the picture.
---
1. It‚Äôs a super rare because of the uniqueness of its abilities, a backwards projectile is not epic worthy but it is more than rare worthy. 2. Supercell is pretty big on robots, it‚Äôs part of the theme of brawl stars, so you should expect more robot brawlers. 3. What‚Äôs wrong with 4 robots in the super rare category? That would be like complaining about 9 of the trophy road brawlers /starting brawler are all human. 4. I appreciate your feedback I always love to hear what others have to say :). i rest my case
---
Pineapple Pizza: exists*
---
Italians: T R I G G E R E D
---
You‚Äôll get there!  What brawler are you working on now?  Or are you slowly ranking all of them up together?
---
All of you got played by the second frank
---
Tying to get the bot to remove for "not having English characters" so I can use it for something.  Ofc it doesn‚Äôt work when I TRY

I hope so

Ok, I hate pineapple pizza, I'm going with shelly.

Yes

Man I love siege idk, yesterday I got with randoms and we won four in a row
---
Reminds me of Avdol.
---
Don't get cooked, stay away from bush
---
Fake it was a friendly game dumbass
---
Yep
---
I remember that people have different amounts of cones and rods in their eyes so maybe it works for you ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Hoes mad (x24)
---
when you want to push trophies and siege isn't available :(
---
bull in the bush: i'm about to end this man's whole career
---
I didn't get a legendary until 4.75k and even that's pretty early.
---
fof is good, there is no teaming throwers and energy drink is pretty fun to play.
---
What did you get from it
---
I didn't get any epics toll 3k and legendary until 3.5 k so stop complaining also it's rng
---
honestly that makes a lot of sense, my bad lol
---
X2
---
Well still, two mythics at 1700?
---
Lol I have 22 brawlers unlocked, including spike. I got spike at 4K trophies!
---
frank tho :0
---
I‚Äôm not opening it until the next brawl talk (which is coming very soon) if there is a new brawler then I will save it
---
That would be hilarious to see. Bodied midair.
---
Im thinking there is gonna be a battle pass added to brawl amd this is gonna be the first season
---
Thank you for the shield hero reference!
---
Veteran colt, mecka bull, Friday the 13th primo. In that order.
---
Interesting idea, but probably to complex for Supercell‚Äôs eyes
---
You mean spinning
---
That gedikor guy is a legend in the brawlstars word rn
---
No you don‚Äôt because it‚Äôs not his
---
Ok maybe

This meme will never die until he gets his buff
---
Nice man
---
I was thinking that but then I remembered after you get Frank's super it's basically no skill required after that haha
---
Obviously, I‚Äôm sure you can figure out why having a big wall and waters in the middle is a bad design.
---
Nice dude good stuff
---
100 percent except for Crow, if he gets invited he destroys everyone even Brock and Leon
---
Everytime
---
I beg to differ. I‚Äôve been playing mike to troll and I‚Äôve teamed with some other idiots like me who brought a thrower. Also teamed with 2 crows and somehow controlled the middle. 
---
And yes. Teaming sucks and I feel dirty. But at the same time. Trophies?
---
Stop piggybacking off of his hard work. Why should he put in all of this effort only for someone else to use it for their own benefit? All of these GEDI_KOR posts are getting annoying.

Luck

Best thing I‚Äôve seen all dayüòÇ

It is possible. I was at 5k with 15 brawlers. Under 150 3v3 wins. 90 Sd wins and 30 Duo Sd wins. Lol.
---
Frkn tight nice
---
Your next box open will give a new brawler.
---
Box:
---
Lol I‚Äôm at 3300 just hit it today need 2 mythic and all legendary I got mortis btw
---
Common guys. Is this really still funny to some people? It‚Äôs sad how these shit posts get the same amount of votes as actual art.
---
Thanks DrPotato777
---
Only good in gem?
---
https://ibb.co/q7BDqxT
---
I also pushed him over 500 on brawl ball yesterday. Poco with Rosa and Frank is a nasty combo
---
Thats why he didnt get invited
---
its a unique af idea. its like what if rosa's super stayed in one spot and was invincible. maybe change the star power, too op. being already invincible is op enough
---
looks goofy
---
Hahaha right. There for take this L.... take it, here. Stop messing up the game pls. I‚Äôm sorry I was a mean just now.
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mess with my crew‚Äù
---
The art is awesome but that 30 gems made me laughüòÇ
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
Wait for what,the poison to kill him off?I play Spike and when I see a Crow or any other mid range high damage brawler(Bo,for example) I switch  lanes if it is in gemgrab,or simply run away if it is in showdown
---
That's a neat meme template

They are daggers, you uncultured swine!

You want tips on Siege? Source of experience - pushed from 400-500 w/ randoms in a day with Crow

Cool

Why miss all the rockets
---
another kid trying to get attention
---
You can't just repost from r/enterthegungeon
---
That's why Brock is on Trophy Road
---
Look closely
---
Or Jessy, or Pam, or Shelly, or Bull, or Primo....
---
I hate you
---
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ;(
---
Well, I guess it's mutual seeing as to I edited it
---
50 coins and 200 tokens is good
---
No, she has to high health ( and max she alsp heals in Bushes), and she charges her Super fast, it's so annoying
---
You can‚Äôt take out gem grab though. It‚Äôs by far the most midline game mode. There‚Äôs not a single brawler in the game who‚Äôs genuinely BAD in gem grab, unlike every other game mode.
---
Rosa: What? Whatafuck!?
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
PNG PLEASE!
---
Happy cake day
---
Precisely. Brock is probably the 6th best in the game rn, EASY
---
Wait thats illegal
---
Eventually everyone from r/Enterthegungeon will come
---
And everyone has him, but of Corse he doesnt get Nerfed, while Piper still Struggles everywhere:(
---
Spike and Crow dont seem to be so affected by Rosa,more like Pam Brock Piper and the other long ranged high damage brawlers counter them,while Leon is getting absolutely rekddddd by Rosa
---
Yeah well, I think he has a kid or two inside him
---
Oh thank you I hadn‚Äôt realized, already a year üòÅ
---
Piper needs a rework before she‚Äôll ever be balanced. So does Brock. Brock is TOO reliable at any range. Piper is either ridiculously overpowered or she‚Äôs actually useless
---
K ben trots mien jong
---
We dont think he sucks,however he WILL suck if they nerf him like 2 more times
---
More useless, cause almost everyone playes Short Range Brawlers, except in Bounty ( exept its Shelly Pit)
---
r/Ifuckingcalledit
---
And that's why Tara needs a buff.

It might also be related to a new game mode

I didn't think so because a simpler russian tag would be \[RU\] like, for example,  \[UK\] for United Kingdom people or \[ITA\] for italians and so on.  
---
I always thought –ë–õ–≠–¢ hide a deeper meaning.  
---
Now I [searched for it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/search/?q=%D0%91%D0%9B%D0%AD%D0%A2&amp;restrict_sr=1) in the subreddit and found these (and others) interesting posts:

I'm an anti teaming dynamike and I approve of this.
---
Search how to use flairs on reddit
---
Then bull one shots him
---
Agreed lol specially those Thrown out the window ones
---
Thats a horrible balance decision. Rarities should only be used to differentiate unique Brawlers from simple ones, that's why Mortis went from Epic to Mythic, he is the only Brawler in the game who has such mobility, but if he was balanced around his status and not his game mechanics the game would not be very fun.
---
Well soon, they will upload the full version of colt riding minecart animation
---
So if Shelly was better than Spike, that‚Äôd be fine in your eyes?
---
So you managed to tie a team that can't push a max brawler past 200 trophy's XD congrats bro. I'm sure this thinly veiled self aggrandizing will surely win you the kids favor. Hahaha
---
No u
---
Play Big Game with so low brawler for the max time
---
Honestly, I do not like it very much.
---
No, I don't think Shelly should be stronger than Spike or else the game would become an auto aim fest because Shelly doesn't take much skill to play. But I am fine with Brawlers like Colt or Brock being better than Spike because those Brawlers take time and effort to become good at, and that's what should be promoted in Competitive games, not luck and money.

So what is she supposed to be doing in the second panel?
---
You forgot the ten gems part
---
they started doing a big attack around 40% and then colt just stopped playing like this game was just going back forth so we would he think that had already won!?
---
But i never said you called them trash i also never said they're trash i said they weren't that trash so yeah

Wow dat code cracking =pro gotta upvote

Frank said in a older post that he was busy working on the brawl stars update so the sneek peak has with update to do but that unlisted video is a mystery
---
Indeed! I had a few in TL as well when I first posted it :P It‚Äôs fun to go back and view your old ideas!

The one I don't have to see. Thousand times a day on this Reddit.

Oops I forgot!. I will next time (thanks)

Yeah probably 80 I‚Äôll do it again with the mortar drown out

Thanks

yup
---
I can tell you made this because it just happened to you lmao
---
Ok 1000 gems

Nah I dont want Mortis vs Darryl. Same brawler is better and fair.

It's been like that for a while I think

Language is different than nationality. The sneak peak was directed to the Brazilian youtubers. And the language of the sneak peak was in Brazilian Portuguese wich is a little different. Whatever. It was directed to BR. When u say Portuguese people think it is Portugal. That's why.
---
Yes I know that, but that still doesn‚Äôt change the fact that frank cannot get his super off half of the time when there‚Äôs a Shelly on the enemy team because she CANCELS ULTS.
---
This doesn't make sense because the next post is from r/btd6 not r/brawlstars .
---
No want me to add him to the list
---
U Suck at drawing

Some guy sent brawl stars hentai in the chat group then deleted it. I shall now give a description
---
It‚Äôs literally Leon with a huge dick hanging out and Jessie (also naked) grabbing the big dick. She has a weird look on her face.
---
Please do not downvote I just wanna say that if a game becomes popular, there would be porn involving that game
---
what the fuck
---
Could you link me the current rankings of brawlers?
---
Well as every super rare op except from penny
---
AND EVERY MYTHIC EXCEPT FOR ME
---
That is the truth. Remember Cuphead and Bendy and the ink machine?
---
oh god
---
this is hilarious..  üòÇ  üòÇ
---
Thanks :))
---
Geneious!
---
El primo is here XD
---
But Poco is a support
---
Even then a good colt can deal enough damage to chip the Shelly down to half her health.
---
Prove what?
---
No problem!
---
User flair checks out, cause you're toxic.
---
"Sub to Pewdiepie" should be a line because he's a kid
---
Only Cark is OP.  Penny Rico and Darryl are only pretty good
---
You're just joking, right?
---
Ik
---
just the pic bro no anime or hentai just a single pic
---
I saw eeeeeel. No clue then i got pri and the bell rang
---
Can't imagine playing other modes after getting the star token unless you have an under played brawler or a cucked by randoms fetish. Showdown is the best measure of how brawlers stack up against each other.
---
In brawl ball you can juke a Shelly super using frank if done well. As for solo showdown you probably can't make Shelly work as there are gonna be teamers, so you're most likely gonna die before reaching the top 5 unless you bush camp
---
But that's only when Shelly HAS HER SUPER. Even still Frank can juke her super
---
probably brawl talk right?
---
Yeah, and I have another photo of that, im posting it now
---
Don't queation
---
This must be how she sustains herself with her plant backpack
---
Brock Counters crow more. Two shots and he‚Äôs dead
---
Either way don‚Äôt buy that mega box
---
Not true, but still a buff to Poco
---
Leon main here. He needs nerfs on damage not invisibility.
---
yea
---
Um yes you can juke a frank super. I said that in one of my replies to you. And I said that Shelly was bad in solo UNLESS SHE BUSH CAMPS. And Bull  and Rosa are better at catching people out from bushes than Shelly can.
---
sorry if you don't like it but i had this idea and really thought it was genuinely funny. i just wanted to share it, didn't expect it to blow up this much.
---
Am I the only one that dont play seige because of this..
---
Angry is idea from Umdertale (Sans)
---
Now crow is a legendary becouse he is so f hard to unlock
---
it is a competitive game, it has what in any other will be called leagues,   
---
so why you do not test your internet connection before playing,  
---
i alway make ping testing to google dns, if i got more than 60 ms, i just reset my networks and test again, i just play if i get 60 ms or less.  
---
it is called common sense...
---
haha you're right! i didn't notice
---
ƒ∞t was time for thomas to go now he had saw everythin dondorondoodon DON
---
even mortis won't be able to beat the power of friendship!
---
Uhh just go to the help and support chat and report the user along with video proof
---
This meme makes no sense
---
I know
---
Finally. Someone did this. Thank you
---
No matter how many star tokens I need, I dont play seige..
---
I feel like he would be more chilidsh,and less edgy,but overall,pretty good suggestions and i hope these get in :))))
---
Its an ad lol
---
I think It's epic or a trophy road brawler for 4000 trophies
---
sicne the game is just 6 months global and most players dont have leon, its better to publish skins for common and rare brawlers to get more profit from it.
---
i guess legendarys wont be getting skins for some time
---
Do you have good internet connection as well?
---
This is a joke. I installed Clash Royale, played a game and it did not lag a single time. Immediately after, played a game of Brawl stars and it lagged. Supercell just don‚Äôt care and tell me that it is my connection.
---
Unless you are content creator, they just don‚Äôt care about helping
---
Your post was below one that said ,,The post down below is made by a teamer" or something like that sooooo
---
yup! that's where i got the video from, but i've seen this meme a lot elsewhere.
---
It's a nice
---
Template please

tbh I just want SC to rework Crow's Star Power

Call me once you get to 690 on both.

Remember you can backstab and  once you have enough power cubes you can beat teamers by focusing in 1 person then the teamers might backstab and if they don‚Äôt just go near them and put some pressure that‚Äôll make it easier for you to kill them bc they‚Äôll probably kill each other
---
I used to play BB and heist,but they ruined heist in the January update,and brawl ball is overtaken by rosa,so right now I am like Showdown,Gemgrab,Showdown,Gemgrab,Showdown,Gemgrab.........
---
Yes!
---
Why tnt guy is using the cape of the creature of the night?
---
Idk :( but I‚Äôm very sad :(
---
on the rare occasion that they kill a mortis
---
Brawl ball is Rosa.
---
It‚Äôll be harder to get her super and chain it, she‚Äôll pose more threat at long range which isn‚Äôt an issue for low trophies players, as the threat she poses at close range remained unchanged, I hope she won‚Äôt be as hated in lower trophies
---
Siege also one of the longer matches though, unless you manage to perfectly win on the first or second siege
---
Well it depends on the amount of trophies you have specially if you‚Äôre under 3k
---

That remind me of Team Fortress 2

I am at 8000.Clubs either have 10000+ or 4000-.I literally can't find a single soul at exactly my trophy range

Poco is weird. He‚Äôs supposed to have a deep voice and look like 28+ or 32+

this meme would be 3 times better if you added  - trophy in front of cj
---
I understand now and I agree. The super chain is very powerful and making that harder to get would absolutely be a good thing.
---
Dude what are you even saying? SC doesn't care only about showdown, they need to check stats (and they do) for ALL gamemodes.
---
Naturally some brawlers will be better at some modes than others, but that's part of the game and it makes the overall meta diverse.
---
Go for a club where you can be at the bottom at like 80/100 so that you learn from the higher ppl. Sticking with a club where you‚Äôre very high in comparison with the average trophies can be bad sometimes. Maybe you won‚Äôt be able to play with 10ks but you can ask them things which is enough to become better
---
- Don't try to punch my Scrappy Rosa!
---
I always do this when playing with mortis
---
maybe brawl stars community isn't that stupid after all?
---
We are the poisoned dagger that guards the realm of birds. We are shadows. We are the void.
---
100% would buy
---
Maybe he looks up to colt? And yea, colt is cocky, but he‚Äôs also cowardly. Leon would would full on cockiness and be in full disbelief when he‚Äôs defeated
---
it is not thicc enough

Coach cory would probably give his soul to satan for this skin

That should be Dynamike sometimes. A bad-angled dynamite that you may use to jump could mean your death. Maybe this should be used to complain about lame star powers, Rico‚Äôs one is actually nice! (Still after one month having him @ lvl 9 I haven‚Äôt unlocked it T_T)
---
When ever I see a dynamite breaking a box all I have to do is move in his general direction and usually they will run or defend the box with their life till the bitter end
---
in real in brawl chanel so many videos can only from link

agreed

Damn she thicc

So true!!!

---
&gt; SC doesn't care only about showdown, they need to check stats (and they do) for ALL gamemodes.
---
Supercell cares about money not about loving their game modes equally. In the free to play revenue structure, it means having the maximum amount of players. Showdown is the most casual player friendly mode and gets played the most. This is why SD has split matchmaking and also why they wont implement brawler kill count, per round kill count and per round damage.
---
Stupid rockability mortis.
---
He should have put on the hat.
---
Not bad! üëç
---
Idk
---
Nice
---
Definitely not me brother. I got my first level 9 brawler several weeks ago (maybe close to a month) and I've opened quite a few boxes since then but no star power yet. Maybe next year when I get my first legendary üòÖ
---
RRRRA! RRRA! RRRRRRRRRAA!
---
Two no-show randoms later and I'm not so close anymore. I wanted to reach through my phone and freaking strangle them.
---
I have to say, I don't know how people push so far. I don't think I'll be making it to 10k, or even 9k. It took me so long to get here I feel like it's the end of the road for me.

It‚Äôs from r34

Gems, Duos, Soccer, Bounty. I don‚Äôt do that solo showdown camping method. Level 1 rank 18 taught me a lot about how to play Leon
---
based on your spelling and grammar i think you‚Äôre the 7 year old fool
---
Yeah IK right, this kid just puts random shit together...
---
Lol. We have a guy in our club who didn‚Äôt get her until he was over 8k. He now has a power 1 rank 18 penny.

The problem with shit like this is dip shit noobs see it and then bring mike and I get paired with them. Take the L indeed Brock

Umm she was in hmhm with you?!?

Dont worry. If you cut out youtube for me. Brawl stars is 90% if my usage
---
GEDI KOR made it and it's pretty good*
---
I played with my friends and my colt got destroyed, guess it makes sense lol

The route is grinding siege with friends

damn you're fast

Ah, private servers. What an interesting time.

No 'cuz he would throw only one grenade with more speed of detonation and range.

As a mortis i could beat them all on my own

Check my other post. Frank already answered that they're currently working on El Primo's new model
---
I never saw a girl with a laser umbrella that can poop bombs while jumping 5 meters high,yet there you are.
---
More like Mortis
---
5 meters is 5.47 yards
---
But... Where she keeps her plant?..
---
Finnaly tara remodel!!!!!!
---
he‚Äôs actually talking about r/rainbow6‚Äòs lion
---
Same speed as small and maybe less than 25% I just thought that him being fast will make him fair for fighting tanks since he is small so he is probably gonna have little hp
---
Spanish yeah
---
I found that it is almost impossible to win in a 1v1 against she who must not be named and El Primo, I have given up playing him because I am totally useless if there is a Rosa in any game mode. In fact, I have given up playing most close range brawlers because of Rosa. I feel like a Jerk when I play her and it's just annoying to go "oh look, a Rosa in (insert game mode)" and then give up hope if you don't have a Colt or Brock or someone long range to counter her.
---
Same happend but I got Mortis
---

How does this work? Just look at how close the eyes are

Yea, by why post that, it‚Äôs not impressive or funny

Very thin wall

this news are months old!

He even said on twitter they will tweak Jessie, Darryl, Spike, Fronk, and some others.

Whats the line between her legs¬øü§î
---
I‚Äôm with you. I don‚Äôt get it...
---
This is spoiler...but you also photoshoped it so...its okay?
---
I think this should just be a 30 gems skin
---
Wtf r u going into my profile
---
this is usually people who "buy" a ton of gems, open a bunch of boxes and then decline the payment for the gems. they are most likely at -XXXX gems.
---
Yes, they‚Äôre done with his model
---
Bad? It‚Äôs fucking *marvelous*
---
RAH! RAH! RAH!
---
Also,since the game is looked from upside,it hard to tell how high she goes even with the dimensions during the jump :P
---
Now that I see that end screen, I did not notice how unbalanced the matchmaking was there.
---
Now I feel bad :(
---
Chill it's just a meme
---
The twitter community is similar
---
My phone does this if I put a case on it. It's very strange. No case, no problem.
---
Rocket Carl?
---
Well yes , but actualy no . Yes a Russian yputuber created it but he did it to make teaming a thing so before like the changes of meotirites if you saw someone with the tag uou can just spin with them and team they have a tradition too if they win they both go in the storm.
---
Why does everyone want a Tara remodel? I don't get it. She looks great. Bo deserved a remodel. He looked ugly af. Pam, Tara and Crow are pretty nice already. Tara could get a few voice lines. Why not Darryl? Darryl looks so ugly. From the brawler they let us choose I would say Piper. She looks good already but she deserves more details.
---
Ummm, they were Brazilian youtubers..

#dynamique

I mean, most people do that, especially with a Shelly with Super, Bull, or Leon/Spike
---
I teamed with an 8 powercube Rosa once to defeat 5 other teamers.
---
Poor Rico man
---
Mortis would be better
---
Facts
---
Just you
---
That‚Äùs relative this time ü§î
---
TLDR; Quit using the excuse of Mortis being high skill capped he needs a buff end of story
---
Can people stop saying Mortis is high skill cap as a bloody exscuse. We don't care if he's high skill capped that's why he needs to be buffed because most people are casual players. Imagine opening a box and getting a brawler which is unplayable for you because you don't have the time or a really good club to be able to practice with. Mortis is decent at gem grab okay at showdown i.e map specific plus half the time you are just bush camping. And Brawl ball is okay but nowhere near his glory. Imo he needs a buff in brawl ball where he retains his dash when he shoots the ball it just doesn't damage but he needs a full buff of health and a small attack damage buff.
---
None of this is confirmed this is all just speculation and wishlist

No, Im the primo

It's annoying

Because you were cornered and they were closing in on u
---
It‚Äôs probably a skin event and each description is for a new brawler
---
Buff crow
---
True but I like how you just pick what is convenient for you to respond to and not everything.
---
Lucky with Darryl cause he didn‚Äôt charge u but skills with piper cause u juked her
---
Whenever Supercell does something requested by the community, the community always scourges for something else to spam and complain about.
---
Healing mushrooms : Not today son
---
Yeah. Their remodels were detailed and colorful. It's still the same brawler, and people should be able to tell after the remodel.
---
Nope. Its been long enough that it isn't his responsibility anymore. We aren't all gonna wait around till every last person sees the damn movie
---
Sakura Spike:let me in
---
Also Sakura Spike:let me iiiiin
---
Judging by the quality of this, I am assuming you took a clip from the spoiler posted on pornhub
---
Idk lol
---
500 trophies in one day damn...
---
Leon is the most fun brawler in the game
---
HAHAHAHAHAHA Lmao
---
Crow needs a nerf, Mortis is the one that needs a buff
---
The thing that makes her strong is her mortar. Its hard to keep a good position on your lane when you have mortar constantly shooting at you. Yeah she struggles 1v1 often but thats the nature of brawlers with spawning abilities. In bounty you don‚Äôt really wanna get into 1v1s, it‚Äôs all about good positioning which lets you create 2v1 fights.
---
No OnE BeAtS dA bUlL

You‚Äôre criticizing me for posting something that doesn‚Äôt display skill and isn‚Äôt funny whilst your profile is filled with posts on r/BrawlStars that don‚Äôt display skill and aren‚Äôt funny.

My design processes and rough sketches are [here!](https://twitter.com/icytamtam/status/1128791145918607361?s=21) :)
---
Oh this is so cool!!
---
crow and spike and leon are also harder to play.
---
many noobs complain about legendary being to weak (ofc crow is buffed atm and alright) because they cant play them well. high rarity bralwers are harder to play once you get up high in cups. spike dies fast, crow has to chip enemies away and kite, Leon is hard to play once people are actually aware of your invisibility! and when you get to 500+ people will always keep in mind that you can go invis, and wont feed your Super so easily.
---
the problem is, that if they buff mortis more, he will destroy high level gameplay! if you have time go on twitter to RLightons page, he recently responded to coach corys tweet, that they do care more about high level gameplay when they do balance changes! 
---
i accept your opinion, im just beeing realistic. if  Mortina gets buffed, then only a little by a little. he was once the mose op brawler (in beta) and they dont want that to happen again. same with crow.

Crow buff leon nerf tara buff next update
---
Oh God serious 'nam flashbacks
---
Please holy god, pick me
---
I really hope they stabilize the servers in the next update and maybe add a ranked bracket so people who want to be more competitive can play against each other and dumb randoms can play together
---
I‚Äôm interested...
---
mortis shouldve been arguing with dynamike
---
~~Gedi Kor isn't the only artist here~~
---
In that case, she‚Äôs good on quite a few gem grab and heist maps, good in sole bounty maps, and good in many siege maps. HOWEVER, she does not need an attack buff. Her star power does need to be reworked but aside from that she‚Äôs relatively balanced.
---
Cool ¬≥
---
Wtf, they're ugly, the quality of their models don't fit within every other model.
---
New brawler on a hoverboard named Simon
---
The only problem with is Jesse is better at all those game modes except siege and I feel like that's a problem she is even good at brawl ball, and she has a faster attack speed, and her star power does something, and her turret can get consistently healed while doing some 400 damage
---
I'm super bad with Barley but when someone else uses him, he's super effective against me.
---
Hopefully a new game mode üòÉ
---
Snowflakes. You‚Äôre probably the people who got me banned for 2 days just cause my name was fa king ur mom
---
Wow
---
Ohhhh ok
---
oof im a global player üò•
---
i think the next update is gonna be a club thing. some competitive aspect to give to the clubs, and of course some 60s themed skins. gl everyone!
---
Not in bounty but in hesit/ some gem/ most siege
---
But again Jesse can do it better which is the problem
---
not really, we dont need it. Piper needs it the most cuz shes the one lacking details
---
r/helptara
---
I'm in!

I want this especially since I have Leon

yotubers: **NEW BRAWLER NAMED SIMON**
---
Dm me the bottom left pic, it‚Äôs for science
---
I agree 100%. Jessie is absolutely better than Penny. Even in siege, it‚Äôs basically a push. The only thing giving penny a slight advantage is the ability to sneak the mortar on the ike. But that‚Äôs nearly impossible at high levels because people are wise to it
---
Does Mortis now DIVOes to grab the first gem?
---
Go Team Spike! ‚ö°Ô∏èüåµ‚ö°Ô∏è
---
Next update will be a huge buff for Spike...I feel it! ü§ûü§ûü§û
---
Probably because jessie fits more into your playstyle. Penny has very different mechanics and can‚Äôt be used as a replacement as Jessie, so you can‚Äôt really compare the two.
---
did you just spell ahegao face as ohayou?
---
Finally another intellectual, #BuffPennySoSheCanBeBetterThanJesse
---
Yup, you gotta love making a Canadian Account to get it early!
---
Perfect a fluffy cucumber
---
The problem isn't they are OP, they are even underpowered. The problem is everything they add is a disadvantage to the one who got the bad RNG.
---
i dont get it
---
Crazy Jessie :)
---
Yes u can, only thing penny has over Jesse is 30 damage and a cannon which isn't the best against lots of bralwers
---
Didn‚Äôt we see a picture that showed the Mortis remodel along with the el primo remodel yet it never got released?
---
You don't get how this meme works. You arare saying one Rosa is called "O", and the second one is called " P", which makes no sense

A spike buff! :D

This is more of a country type of guitar. But at least it sounds good. It would be nice to know what the theme sounds like on different types of guitars.
---
Penny is a sharpshooter, she is meant to snipe people with her cannon at an insane range, along with her attack split. Jessie is to provide control with her bouncing attack and close range turret. Both are used very differently - don‚Äôt be confused by the fact that both have a turret. Penny does need a star power buff, but you seem to be thinking Penny is a bad brawler and that isn‚Äôt very true :)
---
I NEED that spike man. My 5 year old loves spike.
