r/OkBrawlerRetard better to post here
---
Same place sadly.
---
what if Emz is dead tara
---
What’s a good brawler to start pushing? At 13500 and have everyone expect spike, crow, and sandy
---
#Alabama mode activated!
---
What about shotgunner
---
It’s called toxicity.
---
Love the art 💕

An 12 year old wannabe with no talent or experience and living in the white middle class suburbs with a gaming PC and a nice tablet their parents paid for, has got to make a living SOME DAMN HOW.
---
No joke,from 24000 to 19000 lol
---
All the other team needs to do is run any thrower and then Mike gets countered because he can't move to dodge and in his circle
---
*smashes phone
---
Yeah it's pretty good is english your second language then?
---
Me too
---
I don’t get it
---
*cries in confused weeb boner*
---
New idea
---
There is another star power that increases speed
---
Oh
---
That’s not how percentages work my friend. My method is correct, at least I think so, but your way of using percentages are wrong. Lets say p it chances are 0.03%, so then you have to use 99.97% and multiply it to it self. So you would get 99.94% failure chance. And that means it would be 0.06% of success for 2 boxes.

YOOOOOOO Messi has some learning to do

Jesus, this is *the* coolest concept piece I’ve seen here! Also just beautifully done.

So that means the maximum is 6 minutes then

After season end I grinded brawl ball for like an hour on crow... lemme tell u its always the bo’s and rico’s and its very hard to watch
---
nah dont think so but we definitely need more social features
---
How much trophies are you at(I am 1000 k
---
Randy Orton's finisher or move from WWE
---
I had 13k
---
Yep
---
Darryl should be called "Rolling assisaon" for a reason
---
alright let's bounce
---
I'm genuinely interested in your total playtime hours? How much time does keeping up on the leaderboards actually take?
---

---
I have around 300 hours in Brawl Stars, and when I found that out I was a tad bit shocked, honestly! But I had 2500 in Battlefield 3 years ago and someone told me: "Did you enjoy it? Did you have fun? If you did, it's not wasted time." 
---
Congratulations, by the way!
---
randoms be like
---
You're right.
---
So thicc
---
Have you spent any cash in the game?
---
Oh no she needs an AC
---
But then it wouldn't be like the grand canyon
---
It makes me mad that i've been on a losing streak and now I gotta recover over 300 trophies.. I can't stand the randoms I've been playing with... 😡
---

300 from randoms? Ehhhhhhh....
---
OMG you got 8 tickets, so lucky!
---
frank can literally check a whole compartment by himself with one shot, but *no*, he did like nothing
---
&gt;balance is good
---
Not that I disagree, but they definitely need to do something about Frank.
---
So basically the super is a cluster bomb with homing missiles
---
He has extra life!
---
I feel like even on Thousand Lakes where there’s plenty of opportunity to make some amount of use of the star power, it would still be by far the worst one.
---
You cannot reach the safe unless you’re super accurate.
---
Unless it's necessary, otherwise if its a straightfoward goal, jus Frickin walk it in/shoot it in
---
I got no legendaries but i got power 9 poco and later got da capo from a box and im really happy
---
What was the weakness? I’m not seeing anything crazy.
---
Ik this will probably get lost in new but... 
---
So about the little thing on the side.
---
Good means 100% to 60%
---
Ok means 50% to 30%
---
Bad means 30% to 1%
---
When they die, their character icon will turn grey, and their status will be an x. Beside it, will be the countdown for them to come back.
---
That's not what the meme means tho
---
I'm so sorry for talking to you twice, but it seems that you are using a repetitive message in this recycled meme, "Losing streak after a few trophies away". After looking at you account, most of your memes are repetitive and some are pretty low effort, which is going against rule 5. Remember to put more effort into your content when you share it onto r/BrawlStars!
---
This could actually be a good idea for a rework: the rockets can't go over walls,  but you can choose where they land exactly. Would require some kind of nerf though (probably reload speed and rocket explosion radius)
---
In case you missed it, notice how the Pipers unnecessarily jumped after I spawned Bruce...
---
BaNK shot
---
I want both the Bruce and spike but I know everyone else has already beaten me to it
---
people with dynamike star power can get stuck in the walls that’s the only reason this wouldn’t work
---
Just. Because. Some. People. Are. Beating. You. Does. Not. Mean. That. Everyone. Is. A. Sweat. Some. People. Play. Casually. And. Some. Of. Them. Are. Just. Good.
---
Ok, just making sure
---
And unfortunately for us, most of those views come from kids no older than 13 who believe any shit anyone throws at them. As much as you hate these kind of clickbaiters, they’re making money by exploiting the young and the foolish
---
I know right!
---
Only if you are an organized duo, otherwise they will be placed randomly
---
poor red team...
---
I love that counterspin. You just gotta rub it in when a situation like this happens
---
Possibly
---
guys I am shaking...
---
Oh my God please no the map looks great but you know Shelly's would patrol like a bitch (NERF SHELLY)
---
I know it is nnn but still...
---
It's smaller than Hank Hill's pancake tho
---
Neat
---
What the fuck

Did that to a Tara today as Nita. Saved us both!

Why

i’m about to do what’s called a pro gamer move
---
i should up my game
---
Wut?
---
This map would be skewed, a certain type of brawlers would be op, like throwers and long range, also characters that can break lots of walls in a roll (colt bull). But other characters that can’t break walls or shoot far or over walls would just overall suck. Cool idea but honestly it wouldn’t work.
---
Spike wazoski
---
I know, i meant that when i said what i said above (i got 30 downvotes lol)

I don't get it

#wow he can draw better then me

I play lonestar to tilt when I don't mind waiting the 2minutes instead of spending 15 seconds in showdown

Half water half walls
---
Ello m8, u said u r a good artist, and i have some ideas for new Christmas skins, maybe u would draw them, would rly appreciate it, im trash at art.
---
1.Elf Bibi: super would be a ball of ribbon, and bat would be a roll of wrapping paper.
---
2.Snowman Spike: super would be a circle of snow, main attack is a snowball, and small spikes are icicles.
---
So if ur bored and looking for something to do, plz do this :)

Thx

You’re getting downvoted but what you said is right. Making one giant choke point of a map is the single worst thing you could do for balance.
---
It’s a fun concept but it wouldn’t be nearly as fun in practice.
---
Np
---
I'm a guy

Nah bruh save the Mortis dynamikes be annoying as shit

Well put young Padawan

This just went from 0 to 100 real quick

Now live with it😈😈😈

Ah lmao
---
Those guys must have been so scared
---
I mean he can already do this on some showdown maps if he wants right?
---
Pretty sure he started lagging and lost connection.
---
Plz tell me when u finish
---
Congrajulashuns you get internet points!!1!1!1
---
While I am not against the idea of more star powers for more diverse gameplay, your suggestions do indicate you lack understanding of what certain brawlers should and should not be able to do.
---
Only if the boss is visable on one of your teamates screen and not in a bush.
---
Map should be mirrored imo. A map that is different depending on whether you are red or blue will always be uneven and in turn unfair
---
R-I-P LEON
---
Feels bad for brock
---
Man I would have stopped and just killed the Dynamike right there lol. I can't feel pity for them as they are really annoying haha.

Thank You. I think so too.

---
I think people under rate her in 1v1s and because of her health with her reload speed she can take care of a lot of other brawlers
---
Her speed is also pretty high I believe for her health and if needed you can try to use the bear to cut people off.
---
I feel the pain
---
True dat

For those who don’t understand, OP failed the HES it challenge in CR.

Nope, English ain't my first language. But I know that "God save the queen" can change to "God save the king" and some lyrics will also change from "queen" to "king" when queens son will become a monarch

Had you not hit the box's front, you would have clipped the side, off the fence and into the bush below, meaning you could have escaped. But that's amazing, theories aside! GG

Oki lol it’s just funny to see

Why is there a CR post here?

Thats great

Crow eith extra toxic. Theres nothing sadder than 3 tapping a crow as a mortis and the crow not dying
---
That makes sense.
---
Just because you dont know how to play him doesn't mean he's "utterly useless"

No need to get defensive ya sop. You don't wanna read, don't read.

I see primo's, crows, pipers and dinamikes getting stuck and I love that

Why?

This is my first idea that I made using google drawings so please don't judge. I am asking for 'professional idea makers' to develop my idea, please!
---
The bots are highly skilled on practice mode. Winning on practice modes is just as hard as playing against randoms. Obviously on practice modes all brawlers are maxed so it’s a level playing field whereas when you play online, the power levels vary.
---
How you know this picture is from Orange Juice Gaming? I really find this from the video 😂
---
They hatin'
---
youtube clickbait video...dont click lolol
---
r/wooosh
---
This is exactly what I needed.😂👌
---
You wil still need the gold and chance to unlocl SPs so the boxes are still worth. Skins do make you progress faster
---
I like when buying pps actually helps you upgrade the brawlers
---
The contest is awesome 🤩  I will definitely try to upload some models 👌
---
Same
---
Unless you believe your ban was unwarranted, I suggest you don’t dispute it, there must be a good reason supercell banned you they don’t just banned people anyhow
---
This is exactly what happened to my brother
---
Oh, just asking is it your
---
Nope
---
*Supercell to Community*: Do our work for us. Don’t worry, we will pay you in virtual currency that doesn’t cost us a dime, but allows us to take the real dimes off millions of players.
---
If you compare a filter and a actual painting the results are vastly different
---
This has to be done
---
Highly skilled? Theres a lot to say about that but for one all they do is autoaim and walk around
---
Going against randoms is harder, just try to do a bb match in practice mode and choose penny you will see they die in a fraction of a second... 
---
Even if its as hard as going against *randoms* Im sure most ppl will rather have a team in pp, online gives you the change of going against ppl that have a premade team
---
When youre going against bots the brawlers they have are choosed randomly, but if you play online you can get a sense of what brawlers ppl choose in that map
---
Yes the power levels vary so what? Dont see what this has to do with anything here
---
Just a friendly suggestion, it would have been 100x better if you put some of his skin concepts instead of the arm!
---
It's a bug and a scientific calculation/explanation isn't going to fix it. You can try it urself in game, if u stand in the exact spot that I did, Running the same speed, aiming at the same spot that I did, ur shot would go into the goal, unlike mine, which glitched.
---
What?
---
Wait, its my CAKE DAYYY

they’ll love it

There are at least 20 things wrong with this post
---
When supercell need more money but they don't wanna hire artists
---
Fore me team robo spike
---
...the game uses 3D models, so of course they only want 3D artists...
---
By this logic:
---
Gem grab should be removed because the gems spawn in random positions, and the game mode promotes control brawlers instead of high damage brawlers
---
Bounty should be removed because the game mode promotes burst damage brawlers
---
Heist should be removed because the game mode promotes high damage brawlers instead of control brawlers
---
Siege should be removed because the game mode promotes control/high damage brawlers instead of aggro brawlers
---
Could you people learn how to play certain modes instead of crying over it?
---
Ima make u get nita

Are we supposed to post an image for that brawler? Or posting his/her information is enough?

I thought the " was just you not being sure if the quality of the tips were good. Supposed you were an insecure potato the same way you sound like one.
---
Good cast it into the fire destroy it
---
But they won’t be using the actual fan made model...
---
Agreed. But it’s quite sad for those who do skins/fanart for the game but can’t do 3D Modelling as they don’t have the tools needed

No your supost to make a 3d model and send it

too bad I got only 30 tickets ;/

Skill I admit I probably lack  ^^... BUT, as a % of cases it must be very very low? Compared to other star power usefulness?   Which star power do you think has less utility, for interest if nothing else :)?

First of all the olympics are toxic overall and it should shut down immediately because it is just one big scam.  
---
Second, korean leaders are very bad and corrupt, but the people of Korea are great. When there is a common issue, the people of Korea come together and try and solve problems. For example Korea was in financial crisis and was on the border of shutting down. Literally japan and China were getting ready to split up Korea for themselves. But the Korean people all pitched in to help and that’s why korea still stands today. Also that corrupt woman president who got impeached only got impeached because of the people. You shouldn’t hate a group of people just because leaders are bad or just because of a couple korean people. That’s called stereotyping and it’s completely fine cause it’s somewhat based off the truth. But you need to look at the whole picture.
---
It should be:

This is not as bad when I played with randoms, one time I was pam and the randoms where mortis and dynamike, I was soo upset and we could have won but we played for so long that the god mode mini robots came and we got clapped. This was on the first level as well

This would be a useless star power (most of the time) bcz carl needs walls to increase his dps

Dude you noice it now? It is like that cuz Rico was part of the robo army but he got changed if you remember not thicc Ricochet is actually looks like shooter robot

Takedown is understandable since there is one guy that will go for the boss and one guy FUCKING killing one another for powercubes the whole GOD damn game but having 2 bosses in the mode makes the game very damn long, i feel like there should be a passive modifier where you can't hurt one another and focus on the boss or make.the map smaller.
---
Lone Star is bullshit, there is only pipers, leons, crows and daryl.you can literally camp and steal kills from others and boom ez trophies but i still find it more enjoyable compared to takedown
---
He bhagwan! Am asking what's the meaning of them being "backwards". Bcz I don't see any change.

It’s green........................
---
Well it is wrong but he doesnt need much he just need to have 7 seconds invisibility and 632 damage per blade (cmon you know he deserve to take out shelly bo and gene in 2 attacks shelly will become less of a threat and leon will be good again)
---
**TOO PRETTY FOR PAIN**
---

But it's concepts that 3D artists can make. Gedi-kor is still contributing.
---
And I only have primo and barley available for powerplay lone star
---
Is it really hard to make a 3D skin?
---
But at least the boss will live longer
---
Shelly is already pretty mediocre, she always was until Band Aid was created, during which she was the most hated brawler in the game, and after the Band Aid nerf she fell right back to where she was.

dobra mapa

The only brawler currently available is Bo

Soo the "less than 35 coins" is confirmed? Cause my friend told me about a week ago about this and idk how to feel about it

the problem is on the people that brings low level players to high level matchs, it's not supercell fault
---
Sorry, *Dyna*
---
Delet this
---
Wow. How many trophies do you have on colt?
---
The random matching for Boss Fights has been totally crazy. When I play my Colt, I almost always get matched with 1 or 2 other Colts. If I switch to my lower level Pam or a random tank, I only get matched with other tanks :-P
---
And yeah, 3 Pams might be doable at Insane II if all of them do a really good job at directing the boss and protecting the cube-holder, but an Enraged boss is going to be really hard for them to dodge out of the way of.
---
Happy birthdays.
---
Even after all this time the upvotes are still changing
---
Name fits
---
star power *and* something else ;-;
---
Is this on PC?
---
Hes right dont listen the other guy
---
Wow that's a great idea
---
Because he has two forms, which can alternate by using his super
---
Machism? No! Femininism? Yes!
---
Serious, why they don't give us power points to El Primo, Colt, any man Brawler?

Me 4
---
Wow

#just a regular day at the office
---
Here's the maths:
---
0.5472% chance ---&gt; 0.005472 (decimal form)
---
We then so:  1 - 0.005472 = 0.994528
---
0.994528 = The chances of us NOT getting an epic from single box. In decimal form.
---
Then we do: 0.994528^100 = 0.5776988
---
0.5776988 = The chances of us NOT getting an epic from 100 boxes. In decimal form.
---
1 - 0.5776988 = 0.4223012
---
0.4223012 = The chances of us getting an epic from 100 boxes in decimal form.
---
Therefore, the chances of getting an epic from 100 boxes, is exactly 42.23012%.
---
This is 100% true, I know I'm right.
---
In what program did you that?
---
k
---
I see no legendaries
---
Hi there
---
Apparently this image is too cursed that his shoes go in front apparently
---
Lol 2 mythics...
---
You just placed pants in boots slot

If you've seen something extra cursed, check out r/EyeBleach

what the Frick
---
Despite his looks, he means no harm..
---
I got so happy when my season reset mega box had six items in it, but it was just a star power. Never had a brawler from a mega box :(
---
It's so fituman or abgtebgriefthd can't carry their friend who just downloaded the game. Instead of matching the higher level with lowers who didn't sign up for anything it matches the lower who is signing up for high level matches, by partying with a high level, with high level players.
---
My team was made up of randoms, of the opponents made their own team, Supercell can NOT make that match. So yeah, it is SC's fault.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
But no legendaries though
---
Big brain time
---
bit bland, and too clean. also, due to the way true red and true blue works this map would be a bit unfair. try mirroring the top part only and try other shapes
---
ikr, not sure what beef they have but it's always those four
---
Yeah...
---
Did you use blender or maya? I didn't get an armature with the model when I downloaded it.
---
Generally you just want to lead the boss in the way that helps your teammates avoid being hit while still being able to hit the boss, and keep it away from the outer arena walls. The Colt on your team is always vulnerable due to low hit points, so you want the boss looking at you (with high health) when it's ready to charge or blast its lasers. Also lead the boss to walk away from your Colt any time it drops a power cube, to make it easier and safer for the Colt to get in and take it.
---
Leading the boss near internal walls can be useful for getting (very) temporary barriers, but they can also make it a bit harder to maneuver away from some attacks. The water area is probably good for preventing charges, but there aren't many walls up there to protect from lasers. And missile strikes are easiest to dodge with no barriers at all nearby. By late-game most of the barriers have been destroyed, so it doesn't matter much where you go.
---
I know the math. And yes. That is the correct math. But you’re interpreting it wrong.
---
What the math says is 42% of the time you will get the epic in 100 boxes. This doesn’t mean you have a 42% chance. What it means is 42 out of 100 times that you open 100 boxes, you’ll get it. Meaning 58 times, you won’t. Which is statistically significant. You’re far more likely to not get it than you are to get it. So player B, who saved 100 boxes, is far more likely to get exactly what they would have gotten(no brawler, power points, and coins) if they just opened them like player A did. Not only that, but if you save and save and save and then it’s mythic or legendary, your odds are effectively zero that you’ll get it within 100 boxes. It’s not worth it.
---
Sooooo true!
---
are you colorblind, no offense
---
top left, File&gt;Import&gt;fbx then search for it in your files, the model automatically has the texture applied
---
Does that mean the boss is related to the robo brothers?
---
Happy birthday to your friend! I think they’ll love the card, because I do! ❤️
---
It needs to be exactly same for both the teams bro, there are many flaws till it is fixed..
---
Brock-Guys I can explain
---
Bull-you have 4 ammo slot and I have only doble reload when im on low hp
---
Tick-doble reload I only have 12% faster reload
---
8 bit-you have ammo slots advantages
---
*Absolutely not made this meme because it’s relatable for me*
---
:(
---
I swear to god his super reaches you from across the universe
---
Don't forget to remove the delay between shots
---
Yessss
---
Omg they unlocked pams turret
---
It's amazing
---
but when you are a high trophies player and plays with players with low trophies, the match will ne based on YOUR trophies, to avoid high trophies players play against a team full of low trophies players.
---
Wouldn’t that just render the invisibility useless
---
I looked at this photo for about 4 minutes straight, it's amazing
---
3D Art doesn’t mean good 3D art 😉I’m gonna try and make a 3D skin for the first time. Wish me luck!
---
Mouse bot has entered the chat...

14.8? Thats very few trophies!

Crazy ideas guy here
---
What if that's a skin you can get in trophy road.Beacuze the thing in no hands looks as a trophy.hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm (did I forgot any m)
---
the players should be aware of this
---
Not if we make his shots invisible as well! Death by unseen and unknown forces!
---
THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!!
---
UPVOTE!!!!
---
They must pay me in emotional damage with 5 mega boxes
---
What does "/s" mean? (Sly sly me)
---
Except all three pictures are perfectly fine which defeats the purpose of using this format entirely.

I think I wanna vomit

KONO SANDY DA!
---
Sarcasm
---
Thanks for letting me know :)
---
Sandy has mastered the arts of sleepwalking and multitasking
---
Heeeeeeeey, sexy laaady
---
Spam
---
Another way to tell is if a brawler ends up coming out of the box
---
Pointy Hurties
---
Well someone was gonna flex at some point, 50k isn’t a walk in the park.
---
Tbh i have no clue how to do 3D modeling. But i'm gonna give it my best shot
---
DELETE THIS
---
Lmao true, I'll try my best to learn Blender though
---
Good Luck! You'll get the hang of it eventually..
---
I invitet a player and i touch on the create and cancel and you play ticket event on create and no ticket needed.

Why should I?

Resuming all replies: Brawlers voices.
---
Do we have a problem buddy?
---
Happened to me literally 2 days ago while playing on class.
---
idk about you all but did you notice the weird green gecko thing next to shelly???, hint of the next brawler???
---
42% of the time you will get an epic in 100 boxes. Yes, that is exactly what I meant, I don't see how that is any different from a 42% chance. 42% chance is significant in my opinion, a 42% chance that you get a brawler, when otherwise you may have had to wait weeks to get it. Also, even if it was a really low chance, there's almost nothing to lose by doing it. So if there is a small upside, and, in my opinion, an insignificant downside, then there is no reason to not do it.
---
Also as far as I know, the only downside to saving boxes is not getting power points and coins as fast. You still get the same amount in the end, just not as fast.
---
So the way I look at it, there are 2 options: get power points and coins quicker, or, get brawlers quicker and get more brawlers with the same amount of boxes. Second option seems better to me.
---
No just a meme i just recognised ;)
---
I’m not, but others are, it’s a good idea but I don’t really want to do all of that for one skin
---
Frank did a Gedi Kor face reveal:

This is not whatsapp :v

I know right

Because feminisim and equality cant you see how oppressed the female brawlers are?/s

As always Nita's dont get the jokes =/

What did I just watch.
---
CHECK OUT MY GUNS HA HA HAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
But you don’t get more brawlers. That’s not how it works. Your brain obviously can’t comprehend real world application of statistics. Saving is moronic. Not only that, but by saving, you’re gambling on what rarity the new brawler will be. 3 of the last 4 brawlers have been trophy road. And the other was legendary. Your odds of getting a legendary in 100 boxes are functionally zero. And your odds of getting a trophy road brawler are exactly zero. But instead you’ve been fighting with underpowered brawlers for a month. Seems smart.
---
I WILL BE BACK
---
*Happy Shelly with super noises
---
THAT WAS PAINFUL

Think 3V3 bro.

Y u got it from tic toc

I was about to complete insane 3... but NO, 432 hp on a boss left

WHAT NEW TRAILER???!!!

They are right. Dont listen the guy on the top. Thats how reddit works.

The Supercell Make Official Trailer just search it on YT

Yeah, well good luck

No Rosa has this the worst you always think you are outside her radius but never are

I see that you went for the double barely

Die a miserable death

OP, ever considered giving context to the image.

I’m happy with a star power lol

The hat looks a bit narrow imo

I was a 3D designer (freelance) for a while, had some good income. Tbh it ain't difficult at all, few days of learning, and some good creative mind, it's basically like that for everything Design related

Mortis:i am a joke to you???

I’ve actually never seen their artwork but now that they replied to this I feel bad
---
No i am from portugal but the language is really similiar to the brasilian. because a portugues found brasil and actualy We nos say BraSil whit S before whe write whit Z
---
1. 11% isnt 'functionally zero'
---
2. You DO get more brawlers, if you are successful in getting the epic in the 100 boxes, you have got a brawler from what would have not given you a brawler, had you not saved up. Meaning you basically got a brawler, on the first day it came out, just for waiting. No extra boxes, but more rewards. Same amount of boxes, but more brawlers. Yes, its unlikely, but when it happens, it's worth it.

Bibi's is just fine Rosa is where the laws of physics break down

This blew my mind
---
I don't think u understand the meme format
---
I love the fact that there are people in the community who choose to make this beautiful pieces of abstract art like this, have my upvote
---
My gold in brawl stars is accurate but my jar is empty in clash
---
OR he actually played the game and got it
---
I like it better
---
Listen attack us when the boss is invincible but don't do it while it isn't
---
Yup
---
I mean you could still just keep on trying to survive, they'll spawn eventually, it's around 20 sc I think :P
---
ExCuse ME wHaT The F
---
yeah
---
Well if you look at the camera
---
Same I didn’t know I heard that if you have 2 or 3 items (most likely 2) that you can unlock a new brawler
---
Really how?? I have some few skins
---
When you get the skin the background doesn’t look like this
---
This is the background of every skin though
---
Few times I got coins power points brawler and bound from regular box so ...
---
as a semi decent Barley player I can say that Mortises run away from me like if they see the minecart going for them
---
Perfect
---
Believe me I see this scenes in my daily life
---
ksksksks
---
I don’t think so at the moment. It is really annoying.
---
Nope, supercell hasn’t added anything against that... so you just gotta live with it
---
“It just freaking spins right in front of you” amazing words 👏
---
I am so excited
---
Hope BO STYLE
---
You contradict your own statement. You do a get a brawler. If you’re super lucky. Open the damn boxes. It’s moronic to save them.
---
Good job!
---
Run
---
I like to think of it like if Darryl has a boice
---
This is the last thing you see before you die from bo with snare a bear star power
---
*laughs in im using blender and mineimator*
---
Do you even know what "killed" means?
---
I was too... it was dissapointingly bad. BUT THEN like 15 brawl boxes later i unlocked piper. yay...
---
Wtf?
---
*play of the game
---
I want female brawlers with men skins I'm sick of witch Morta baker Barla and sakura Spika
---
I played a boss battle with 2 Mortis
---
We already have that for the other 364 days of the year it's called free item shop.
---
Welp you dont know what is reload speed
---
Do Not* I have misstyped
---
Vc é brasileiro

Aw cmon! I wanted the yellow sans and alcoholic robot but I got black bird and green kid!
---
Woooow
---
That sucks man
---
Supercell Make or Brawlstars Make, just got released and you can find it around here somewhere
---
Yup. Watched a video on it and the background is the same colour
---
DUDE THAT HAPPENED AGAIN LIKE A 10 SECONDS AGO
---
We aren't suppose to rely on star powers and supers, we should just be able to walk through an opening whereas this map blocks people on the outside from the inside.
---
Okay This Is FUNNY
---
Finally
---
Perhaps this means the Supercell Make concept to create skins will extend to Clash Royale/Clash of Clans as well.
---
 what version of blender is it?
---
Stop trying to make me fail NNN
---
You make in Unity?
---
Why did you edit stuff? Where you doing this in multiple games
---
Hhh i love this is much
---
Spike reminds me of Plank from Ed, Edd and Eddy.
---
42% chance for an epic isnt very low, you dont have to be super lucky. Yes is doesnt always work, but it's still better than not saving because when it does work, you are literally getting more brawlers in the same amount of boxes. Whereas someone not saving up has a 0% chance of extra value. And their only benefit is getting there power points and gold, which are not very important, a little earlier.
---
Stay strong soldier.
---
Someone can't afford a skin? Jokes aside you would literally play alone
---
No. They always have a hidden video. Ryan always drops hints when they’re recording to get the hype going.
---
Then he gets nita but the owner takes nita for buffs
---
actually everything in this game has the potential to deal the damage it's supposed to do and in reality Barley Sandy and Emz have the biggest potential to break it some liquid or sand on the engine and no more robo
---
Leveling up brawlers isn’t important? Ok, Einstein.
---
Wtf yesterday I did something like that with darryl bit it wasn’t as that
---
I believe that's his wattle.
---
Does anyone know the drop odds of legendary brawlers? Ive gotten all the power points for all of my brawlers. Have yet to unlock crow and sandy
---
Any idea what the % odds per box of unlocking legendary brawlers are?
---
Nah, I don't like cosmetics in game at all :/
---
Oh shit
---
I'm getting a lot of 2012 flashbacks
---
I dont think is something to drink at all..
---
But it would be useful
---
I understand, I didn't mean to be rude actually. But as I said, you would almost play alone, also I think it would take a lot of coding
---
Crow deserved the buffs
---
I like how Mortis is a boy but
---
I will risk it, because im brave and not afraid of you barleys
---
I'm already worried about how expensive it would be to level up a brawler to level 15 lmao
---
This is the most cursed thing I've ever seen
---
ah yes the few not brave but stupid yeah they were delicious
---
If your ideal leon buff can 2 shot shelly and bo again thats not balanced. I think they should bring his super back to 7s but his healing to 900. I feel like invisiheal was always under powered compared to smoke trails. Im no expert but 900 health per second should make both star powers decent and leon himself less star power reliant when it comes to using his super
---
Are all jokes about Teamers bad now? I mean, it's so fucking overused but hey I liked this one. Don't downvote or hate on me please.
---
Yep, delaying a couple upgrades is worth it in my opinion, especially if you have everything level 7+, upgrading isnt hugely important. If it only slows down progression very slightly in the short term; in the long term, not at all.
---
*it just freaking spins right in front of you*

Oooooh, so you are soooo good you say huh. Well then, keep dreaming kid

Oh look! A skin stealer!
---
Keep saving those boxes then. And keep whining when you don’t get the new mythic on day one.
---
That chin tho
---
Yeah but is it like 50 power points? No.
---
 Um sty but this will never gonna end
---
No worries dude xD I can take a joke.
---
Aah the problem I have with skins is that I always get distracted by those effects and stuffz sometimes even a hotbox seems different. Especially with that Dark Knight Jessie skin, and regular (no clue what's it called, the same one as the dark, but light xD).
---
Actually, it wouldn't take much coding. Me and my friend made a game a while ago for our school project, and he was insisting on adding skins, and I made a function that would just not show anything but a base model to the player. 
---
I'm not really familiar with the multiplayer, but theoretically it's the same thing
---
But this is powerpoints. You dont get those for free from item shop without coins.
---
Rosa*
---
*EEEELLLLLLL*
---
Ragazzo, c'è gente che a 15mila mancano i leggendari più alcuni brawler mitici, devi solo avere pazienza
---
You mean for example I would use werewolf leon but you would just see a  normal Leon?
---
May I redraw Snowman poco but different?
---
Yeah, let's have Jotaro Bibi

what version of blender is it?

Quel video in più c'è da tantissimo tempo in realtà ma non ho mai capito se è un bug o se hanno messo un video privato
---
Garip
---
In teoria la seconda
---
So in BIG box I collected 120 coins( with 3 items remaining) and got star power(Hyper bear)
---
probably because your close to maxing out your brawler's powerpoint. same thing happended to me.
---
I get this if I split screen the app and rotate it back just right. It also applies in game  modes but I can't tell if I'm seeing more of the map or not
---
I got 6 items in my mega box, finally got Gene
---
Mi hai risposto velocissimamente 😂 comunque sì, penso anch'io
---
How did you di this?
---
Gagnam style in 2019. Well that's a suprise
---
Yee, That's what I mean. Take agar.io for example, you can just check or uncheck "Show skins" checkbox, and everyone would still be able to see it, except you. And ofc, people who's "Show skins" or Hide skins, doesn't really metter, box is checked/unchecked
---
It was literally in the trailer for supercell make, it’s obviously gonna be added
---
Thanks to u/GEDI-KOR fore the original picture
---
Thank you!
---
They should buff a lot the boss in other to remove the bots, that way is truly a boss fight.
---
Fun fact: you don't have a skin
---
Ah sh*t, here we go again..
---
It gave me 30 coins but no brawler
---
I see, it wouldn't be a bad idea, even if personally I love skins 😂
---
It took me 7 months to get the pun. Im now in depression because of idioticy
---
True but I only have 20k
---
Sure I love your art stile you and everyone can remake eney of my skins
---
God i have the same problem
---
Hello, I wanted to ask you a question regarding the modeling:
---
When you finished the model and shaded it smooth, how did you achieve the smooth effect intended?
---
 I know this sounds confusing, [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/dyqfex/i_need_some_help_with_the_shading_i_am_trying_to/) is a post I made asking for help, would you be able to?
---
leon: instead of walking away your coming
---
Bibi: how else would i beat the crap out of you
---
Interesting thought. I never split screened any app before and I didn't got into game as I wasn't sure it would work. I restarted and the game fixed itself.
---
I didn't even know men's day existed thanks for the information.
---
I do love how they look. But not a fan playing with people using remodeled ones. Recolored ones, I have no complains over, they feel as the regular ones

They have less health than a crate.

Darryl: "HAVE YER PRESENTS, PESKY BRAWLERS"

Hopefully his lines will be just like these

Awful execution but great taste

Your odds can be seen by going to shop clicking on a big box. Then click on the info icon. Itll display your luck chances. Keep in mind everyones chances are different bassically.
---
Its a ashame our favorite Barrel, Ball Pit, Geologist, Arcade Machine, Bartender, and Bomb. Deserves a appreciation day too.
---
Fun fact: This is a sentence after the words "fun fact"
---
As far as I've noticed, when you get something cool from normal brawl box (brawler/star point) it lags a bit more than normal before opening.
---
run Brock! RUUN
---
Please tell me you just forgot the humour flair
---
Yes you can lol
---
They gave me 150 on women's day lol
---
I must be dumb then
---
sorry, me and my bad english, haha.
---
Why? This is a serious post. Women and men are equal, y’know...
---
This is such a big yikes but at the same time OP’s got a valid point.
---
Self promotion is against rules
---
Do you know how?
---
It's not humor it's the truth
---
Someone playing Tick in boss fight.
---
And a darryl
---
I saw this as a 2D art before
---
Una pregunta porque me sale que se ha producido un error al crearme una cuenta en supercell id? Yo puse cuenta que tengo en mi correo y me sale eso porque?
---
No, that happened randomly.
---
Wdy mean by that?
---
They already posted the teaser, the korean brawl talk is already recorded
---
Frank met him in Korea
---
Dance was so clean I didn’t even notice it
---
something i ussually dont understand is that people say they have low chances of getting a legendary but their actually high and we dont know how many trophies they have
---
I would like this skin to be implemented in the game.
---
Oh what that in the bottom left corner 🤔
---
At cooking* u didn’t finish the sentence
---
Couldn't you just write "thanks" ?
---
And this is a bad thing because?
---
Once I saw a non-max Gold Mecha Bo random plays horribly in 3V3
---
This proves that skins doesn't determine players' skills
---
Most are accurate, you get updoot
---
Ohoho then come as close as you like
---
No, in being in the kitchen
---
It took me 2 weeks with crow, primo, and poco no star powers just to finally get screeching solo from the seasonal mega box
---
Nice skin but this is a repost, at least credit the original
---
Yeah. They pick what ever in other game mode but i dont know what was wrong with that dude. Like, does he has a brain?
---
And what if you already have all the brawlers and sp
---
Actually upgrading a card to level 13 on Clash Royale is much harder than upgrading a brawler to level 9
---
Idk what you mean i was playing Lwarb its a private server and the i saw this skin
---
You get gold tho
---
Nibba HOW
---
old rico's model🦍
---
We’ll be right back
---
Oh yeah! I remember now!
---
But I dint know he was a gorilla
---
What a freaking idiot.
---
I have a Big brain
---
The sharp pieces of glass on barley's attack damages the enemies, not the whiskey
---
Make him do default dance
---
Not teaser. They often just post pick where they film brawltalk or do makeup
---
Do this with tick
---
He wasn't even the first person I had today own goal on purpose
---
Should have way more gold on clash's side
---
Im at 14k and only Crow
---
They have different voice pitch, but they talk the same indeed. I've noticed it a pretty long time ago, but I don't think many other people I know did.
---
Rip wanna play with me?
---
Swords kinda small tho
---
Tbh mega boxes suck they need a huge buff
---
Im at 15k
---
Do you have a Xiamo A2?
---
I hope you get your next legy soon :)
---
Just spam tap the crap out of them, what are you guys on.
---
I dont think there will be brawl talk, Ryan confirmed theres no new brawler in this update
---
Nah I'm good
---
He is still a mortis, and I'll use any mortis skin I like. Fk the haters.
---
Are those 18 stars from the brock?
---
500 is literally nothing
---
This is a low effort meme, with a pretty repetitive message.
---
I got Crow at 800 and almost had a heart attack and now when i get a near brawler im just chill but relieved because i havent unlocked a non-trophy road brawler since Tick's release because that is when I got Bibi
---
We should play duos sometime
---
Ah yes...this Is deserved.
---
Regarding the mega box, I would sometimes get 6 items and no brawler... • -•
---
Thats a bit racist not gonna lie...
---
Look some YouTube.
---
Here's a vid: https://youtu.be/2XncG_Tfda4
---
Many of those 25 have never seen the light tho
---
I got spike in like February and I’ve been playing a lot and opening boxes with star points and buying the packs. I did buy leon and crow with gems though because i hadn’t gotten a legendary in like 7 months.
---
It looks like you are using a meme with a repetitve message: Gold in other supercell games. I've seen way too many of these memes
---
Also, you haven't put any effort into it, which is considered a low effort post (Rule 5). Please put more effort into your posts and prevent the subreddit being dominated by low effort memes
---
Yeah but there's a chance
---
Moto g6 play
---
Italia paese dominante presumo.
---
Theres a Darryl where you typed "Mortis going invisible" bit there is no one platino as a Darryl
---
I said maybe but ok lol
---
Sandy? Who Is Sandy?
---
Wow that's a dick thing to say dude, how about a fellow Mortis not getting the joke
---
"DELETE THIS" isn't funny, what's the punchline idiot
---
make an actual design, put more effort

I mean it's more than zero

I know
---
This is a low effort meme with a repetitive message: Teaming in Showdown (against Rule 5 in the subreddit). You didn't even put any effort into this post; instead, you choose to put 2 pieces of text on a picture and hope for upvotes?
---
Really cool and useful, thanks!
---
not really u can do this in 1-2hours
---
THAT IS RELATABLE

SmashLand and SpookyPop were Killed inbeta

Gold in Clash of Clans: So large you can't even see it

Certo che fa ironia che ti chiami lo sfortunato e pensi di trovare un leggendario, ma stai tranquillo amico mio. Ho più coppe di te e sono bloccato nella tua situazione. Btw this Is an english server so i would suggest you to talk english!

I mean you got the joke right?

its still not good sorry

meh I tried

*fades away because of this post*
---
Yo post this in CrowGang mate
---
Sorry, the meme you used is recycled (Which goes against Rule.5). Please prevent repetitive messages in memes (ex: Shelly's super, gold in Supercell games, Pam needs a skin) and help make the subreddit cleaner.
---
Nah I still would want to win to get my star token
---
Nice skin!
---
I think they thought they had no chance of winning since there was no ball carrier but randoms don't know that crow is auctually a great ball carrier
---
Is it hard to get them? I am only missing sandy and spike, just hit 8k yesterday to get hairspray girl. I’ve played since bet. I feel like this game deals out rewards nicely.
---
Literally barley always leaving a puddle when fighting mortis up close,means guarantee 960 damage,so chances unlike with tick/dyna,are 50/50.
---
I was dreaming of unlocking Leon since 3K. Now I'm here 29/30 without having Leon...
---
Ah, ok. Same interface. But what is your question?
---
How long are those arms...?
---
 "So you see, that's where the trouble began. That chin. That damn chin."
---
I only get brawlers from free boxes i never got brawlers from mega boxes and big boxes :(
---
I like RISK tara, DONT TELL ME HOW TO LIVE MY LIFE WOMAN!!
---
What do you consider god player
---
Ive been dreaning of leon since 100 and im at 27/30

Well its good if you are bad at a map or a gamemode

It’s international men’s day. The devs did nothing for it. What you’re talking about is called a daily reward
---
Awesome! I just thought of this and looked it up to see if anyone else had as well. One idea I had would be for him to shoot icicles that break into smaller pieces, I think that would look very cool. I like you concept!
---
Thanks for telling me but why do I have negative 5 points(or downvotes)
---
It freaking spins?!
---
Ok,do your job in this sub,while there will still be low effort posts in the future.
---
Damn! Insane IX with 4%? My best was Insane VIII with 1% at god mode. That's pure luck right there bro, gg
---
False modesty. Oops.
---
That's an oof
---
I know! Shelly is *soooooo* hard to get
---
Don't think so...remember, there are people who grind way harder than me (I get 18k-19k per season), and there are 2 gold skins...

Haha yeah same! Tbh they need more endgame content. I'm at 16k but imo the incentive to push ends at 10k maybe??
---
And Dio Primo
---
My point is men day is a joke and is the 364 days of the day, women's day actually means something.
---
But tick is not a robot tick is a tick
---
Beautiful
---
The best skin!!! 🇧🇷

If that was really him then that would be against his own words lmao
