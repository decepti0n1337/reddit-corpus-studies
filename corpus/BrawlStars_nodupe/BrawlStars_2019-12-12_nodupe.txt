Idea change crow to jump and die

---
---
Agree with point 1 and 4. Unfortunately Supercell kinda caters to those who are willing to pay since they are a company after all
---
Bruh, thought it was Michael myers
---
Just look at win rates he is only really good on lonestar. He is dogshit in other modes
---
Idk how to use it :'(
---
Spike...(I'm so good)
---
A picture with no edits with just a caption, tell me if that's effort
---
Yeah, I think those were my biggest problems
---
Rosa is red primo is blue I hate that dude and you do too
---
Give this man gadek a clown makeover
---
It's a star power... you get it from a box if your brawler is power 9.
---
YOU GET WHAT YOU FUCKING DESERVE
---
I dont trust a guy named Brock_OP üòÇ.
---
I think invisiheal needs nerfed but leon needs a buff either super duration or health.
---
ok sir may i ask y ur IQ is lower than room temperature
---
No. Brawlers should be rare.
---
Yeah, I get that, I just say for the people who play Brawl Stars and don't call their account complete unless they have every single skin, and try to go through such a process just so they can call their account "100% Complete"
---
True. The biggest clown are the ones who use their super on you just to get 1 or 2 cubes
---
That‚Äôs why I said not to much, but I see your point
---
It would be good, to tell you to stop attacking brawlers &amp; focus more on the robot, &amp; thus quicker matches?
---
Unreal Tactical Shotgun = Shelly
---
Hill with smile
---
I mean, he does look kinda like jotaro
---
 I‚Äôm saying it like that because rn it‚Äôs like 0.34% I‚Äôm saying like 5% is what you get for a brawler
---
Nobody actually knows.
---

---
Officially, we know that there is *something* planned for the anniversary. As to what that is, it‚Äôs all speculation.
---
Personally, I‚Äôm in the group thinking it‚Äôs going to be an update, or perhaps the day of the Brawl Talk telling us what to look forward to. It absolutely could be as simple as a free mega box, though, or potentially it could be something else entirely.
---
Rosa is red primo is blue I hate mihia and so do you
---
I   H O P E.
---
I never said sleep. Neither did the meme
---
For what type because that is way to high
---
F
---
Who cares
---
5% rare, 3% super rare, 1.5% epic, legendary can stay the same
---
Happy cake day!
---
This is traced from the official models/art, because the poses are the exact same, and it definitely looks traced imo
---
Uhh... is your screen ok there? Ya might wanna report this bug to devs..
---
bruh...
---
Me too didn‚Äôt see something
---
Bull you made my day!
---
It‚Äôs a top down view so part of the wall isn‚Äôt in the way.

That was on purpose

Lol

Maybe bcuz we have different regions

That would be a good idea

Love the white crow, stands out a bit

Best dad joke in this sub
---
So true. I hate when they do that.
---
Basically yeah
---
Rip bro
---
Rosa
---
The only big difference is aesthetics
---
I main white crow and I have Phoenix crow lol
---
Honestly as of late you‚Äôre not wrong, I don‚Äôt play much showdown and I‚Äôve noticed this. I think it‚Äôs bc of higher trophy gain more easily. I‚Äôm also starting to notice more low power level brawlers at higher trophies for the same reason
---
3k players: get 30+ power cubes but don‚Äôt touch the bot at all and get rank 10. Based on s true story that happened twice
---
Helping you for what your colt to rank 25 or for 15,296 star tokens?
---
r/pipisgang
---
I really like that idea, but the coordination would drop variety. I feel like if randoms could coordinate, you'd see the same team comps over and over again because comps like Rosa, Daryl, and Poco are bound to win in almost any mode. I.e. Brawl Ball would turn into Frank, Shelly, and Daryl, and Bounty would literally just be Colt, Penny, and Crow. I think it may be easier to just leave that as is with randoms being uncoordinated because if you're desperste to win, you can just friend them anyway. 
---
(And it might just be me, but I enjoy having to adapt to different scenarios of brawlers instead of memorizing the meta. To each his own, though.)
---
r/typemoresubs
---
Same thing happened to me with two Rico‚Äôs
---
When?
---
I think they‚Äôre giving us a bunch of easy boxes  for a new brawler that‚Äôs gonna get revealed.

This morning my team was power level 2 2 and 6 and they were all 6s. Match making is so bad today

Man that's sad

---
Leon needs more nerfs, Change my mind. 
---
But seriously high damage with no aim required and you can go invisible? The fact that his super is not incredibly OP doesn‚Äôt mean its bad. You literally go invisible. What the fuck. How do people still think Leon needs a buff? Most of the times im making the right plays but it doesn‚Äôt matter because Leon can get away autoaiming me. Ive heard people say it sucks for everything but Lone star and that makes no sense. Being invisible can be HUGE to get valuable kills in Brawl ball,Gem grab and Siege. If anything he needs a rework. Like his invisibility flashes every 3 seconds instead of being constant but lasts longer and you cant be auto aimed while using your super. Thats what i can think of off the top of my head, im sure someone can come up with something better than just reducing the duration of the super. Leon is easy to use and annoying to play against.

nah he just did more damage

I'm assuming its a Brawl Stars theme because Piper isn't the only one with black eyebrows in their portrait.  So does Shelly, Colt, Jessie, and Pam.

Sorry it wasnt a trickshot

It depends, because on showdown it would not be fair that you see most of the brawlers while resping or seeing leon becoming invisible when he is on spawn. But maybe maybe :)

unless they add something like trade

I bet supercell will do it
---
How about the opponent?
---
How does a Mortis escape? Huh? Magically gain ammo? If you‚Äôre gonna steal a power cube you would have to use all your ammo if you don‚Äôt want to be gunned down. His attacks do literally 1000~ damage, what‚Äôs that going to do to a Nita with a much faster reload speed and about the same damage? And you say Jessie has a low dps but it‚Äôs higher than Mortis! She has faster reload speed &amp; about the same damage. For Shelly, she can easily just spam auto aim and *bam* where the fuck did Mortis go? For Carl, how does a Mortis escape a Carl if 1. He doesn‚Äôt have any ammo 2. Carl has a medium range that can easily 3-4 shot Mortis. For Brock, he has a high enough dps to stop Mortis, and it‚Äôs not that hard to auto-aim a weak Mortis coming **close** to you. For Spike, this is probably the most idiotic one, do you think Spike can only deal damage if he lands a full shot? Well then you‚Äôre wrong. This Jessie raping cactus will destroy your family in less than a minute, same for Rosa, you‚Äôre underestimating Rosa and over estimating Mortis. She‚Äôs a **TANK** she has high movement speed, and a high dps. What makes you think this squishy little Mortis can withstand Rosa **and** outrun her with the little attacks he get. And what do you mean by Bo has no chance of stopping Mortis? Mortis is going to run out of ammo when he‚Äôs pretty close to Bo, and even if he jukes some of Bo‚Äôa shots, he‚Äôs just going to run out of ammo eventualy
---
Rockabilly mortis is 150 but he was on discount for 39 gems, so isnt their lowest discount 39?
---
Oh, ok.
---
he probably doenst have one

That‚Äôs usually true. Although not remodels, the two beach skins Jessie and Brock got BIG discounts right before they got new effect changes. So did Caveman Frank right before his remodel (still an ugly skin though )

Very accurate and funny meme. Having this happen a couple of times before has caused me to wait 5-10 seconds before hitting play again whenever I ditch a team of awful players. That usually does the trick since they spam the play button as fast as their auto-aim. ü§£

Way to sound like a jerk.

Every brawler in boxes has a blue background, even if they‚Äôre mythical or legendary.
---
Ah.
---
I also wouldn't buy star powers from the shop since gold is scarce right now. I have the ability to upgrade 7 brawlers to level 9 but lack the gold to do so.

maybe they are hiding the real surprise on night who knows?

Wow that‚Äôs insane. One in a lifetime box.

Rip your legendary drop rate btw.

Where

3 gems are equal to 3/10 brawl box if you buy it from the shop. Tickets however can be used in robo rumble and if you get max time it will almost be a full brawl box (96/100) so I guess it‚Äôs better. (Unless you want to buy some cool skins then go on! Looking forward to buy some limited Christmas skins!)
---
If you go to the brawler select screen and tap on a brawler, then tap on the top right corner where your rank and current/trophies to next rank are, it'll make a box pop up to show you how many star points you get for what trophy levels. You might need to be rank 21+ for this to work, not sure. It's very unintuitive and hidden and I just found out about it recently despite being a long-time player.
---
The first cutoff is 70 star points for every brawler at 550-599 trophies at the end of the season, then 120 star points for 600-649, 160 for 650-699 etc.
---
Welp I guess everyone can start some kind of theory anyway

Here's to many more

Lol I guess so
---
Shell shock
---
supercell has one of the more aggressive monetization plans i‚Äôve ever seen. Like, have you seen clash royale? Just because other games are also expensive doesn‚Äôt mean supercell is okay. 
---
Even tho it‚Äôs f2p i don‚Äôt like their monetization plan at all because they use gambling to make money off of kids. 
---
Also 99$ is a lot of money for most of us.
---
I mean most people are just way too impatient about the update. These people probably have only had less than 2 weeks to work on this. We need to give them time

right there

Yep üëç

Guys this is obviously mortis soaked in slim from the Halloween decorations.
---
Its not because nobody likes her, it's because she has high standards. Cause she's a princes and nobody deserves her :v
---
I got trash from mine
---
Poor Pam :(
---
Not in my sight
---
Awesome
---
yes many more global releases of brawl stars
---
Hehehe, cuz some of these randoms are well played, i guess
---
I Think it is the New brawler

8bit sp
---
OMG there is some Russian who speak english
---
WhEn Is It?
---
Congrats, i got spike and after 7 months got sandy, you got my two legendaries in one box, interesting, good luck getting the others
---
To all the parallel universes
---
I think ToDAy

---
I dont even have crow..... :'u
---
barley
---
That‚Äôs hot
---
Weird flex but ok
---
It says "made you look"
---
Is a background dude
---
The saddest part is that it looks like you posted it to a story or something
---
Got sandy like you
---
—Å—É–∫–∞ –±–ª—è—Ç—å
---
He mean brawler flair
---
Something is coming soon
---
It‚Äôs the user flair
---
Poor me, I opened but no star power
---
I got mortis. I haven't played the game in forever so I wouldn't have without this post so thanks.
---
Not really weird considering theres nothing that really differentiates or shows if you've played the game before global
---
well i did get some coins at least
---
Exactly, a polished update is way better than a rushed one
---
sometimes you play a cool match under 400 trophies but there is no replay
---
Dude you didnt even bother stealing powercubes. come on man. Just please take your camping skills elsewhere, like at 50 brawler trophies and 200 total trophies.
---
Dude mortis literally steals power cubes like it's a candy from a child
---
this is from supercell?
---
Yeah he clearly sees gold mecha crow and bo but then he sees them as something else when he puts the glasses on
---
Here‚Äôs to another great year!
---
Hey least y‚Äôall are getting something. For us maxed accounts. It‚Äôs just... nothing. But the thought is what matters.
---
Mega effort /s
---
Stop. It takes time. You should help prepare brawl talk if you are that excited for it.
---
No, it‚Äôs obviously bulbasaur
---
At the end of the new Brawl Stars video
---
u/ryan_supercell
---
Yup, they posted it on twitter, its a bigger picture. I just cropped and zoomed as much as i can to focus on this one confetti
---
my main account is called LOADING... and my mini account is called LAG
---
Don't need to get the others if I already have them haha but yeah, incredible luck
---
At least it keeps increasing that chance tho
---
Good bot
---
It's called photoshop people.A thing of the futre
---
ebic
---
This is so coool

I'm assuming you are wanting the banned account checked?

---
SUPERCELL,Hello! On my account play l and question people! Where is my Megabox???;!!
---
It Points to ELLLLL PRIMOOOOOOO
---
Phoniex if it's on sale
---
Agree
---
that's a rock in the background and a red confetti
---
yeah i guess or tomorrow they show a picture and then they release it on saturday or sunday
---
Crow
---
Sandy!!!
---
He's inside the Builder Hut.
---
What ### Fuck does this mean
---
they should implement the challenges of clash royale, when you finish a long and hard challenge they give to you a legendary card (new) , something like that i would aprove it but gift for nothing.. Unacceptable for me
---
I saw an account called ‚Äúpublic‚Äù and ‚ÄúToe Collector‚Äù
---
To be fair he did reset the counter, but using his super to attack instead of retreat is something else
---
There is no new video right? Do you have a link?
---
If u think like that then say how will u balance Shelly?? I mean if u will Nerf Shelly's super then how will u buff her??? Bcoz nerfing her super will make her completely unplayable .,..
---
Don't worry my luck for legendary brawler now is 0.0151%
---
Congrats guys!
---
Coins and tickets
---
A mega box = 10 normal box
---
Don‚Äôt expect so much
---
How do i put in my account?

oh yeah but how does he has leon flair and doesn't know what is it?

Gems. Tickets. Power points. The usual.

No, she is just a fan/groupie for Poco... Calavera Piper is the chosen one.

Agreed, I got every character maxed out so the mega box is useless, atleast brawl Stars team still cares tho
---
Nice art! I love it!
---
The point of this format is to show the true base reference of something. Peter blurted is the thing we know and recognize, Peter seeing clearly is him seeing what it actually is. This meme intends that the skins are just basically pikachu and bumblebee. Peter doesn‚Äôt need his glasses and sees clearly that the skins are derivative.
---
I don't see my talent in my account
---
This is a repost already. So that means... did you beat yourself up? xD
---
#ME
---
I got the same random 3 times in a row in Power Play
---
Hmmmm ok then
---
Bone collector would've been better
---
Ye there is unlock a brawler before getting it in trophies road
---
I got 1 thing lol
---
???
---
Yeah at least I'm getting some PowerPoints gems n tickets
---
The six SP that were leaked were amazing. :D
---
Sure
---
Wait....I've seen your name before I think lol
---
on mobile website change it to desktop mode and then press on community options you will see "change user flair" click on it and choose your favourite one
---
Remember me before it gets blasted with comments-
---
They are not limited skins :)
---
I think bo looks like the world
---
I got Leon and I‚Äôm happy
---
But you cant show your buddys that, like i want something to show the date youve been playing
---
I got 3 gems
---
Look at this clown
---
almost same thing happened to me but in older bounty I matched with 2 really good players and I left them and then I joined them again and again then I clicked play again and played with them few matches
---
Thanks man
---
Ani if was the song of the twelve gift
---
For example, today a megabox and tomorrow two small box etc.
---
Fat me, best thing was 8 gems
---
I got coiled snake and thought I was lucky
---
Yes but this could be a lot frustanting too... trying to push 1 brawler and the best mode to play him he is banned... 
---
I think the best way to do this is what they are already doing. Focus in balancing the game... if the game is very balanced we should encounter different brawles in all maps/modes. 
---
So you doesnt need to ban one brawler cuz it will not show on all matches.
---
No surprise, actually.
---
STOP USING CROW IN TAKEDOWN!
---
IT IS FOR SKINS. SKINS! Everything in this game can be EASILY achieved F2P. Want cosmetics? Pay for it! More aggressive monetiazation xD. Literaly I'm laughing my ass off. Let me invite You to Star Wars Galaxy Of Heroes - shall we?  
---
Brawl Stars is most F2P friendly game I have ever seen that got so big.
---
Yeah man raul13it has been always good at maths
---
There is more legendaries in clash royale and you need to get every one several times until you can upgrade them. In brawl stars legendaries are really rare. I think a box would be better as a reward. Just don't want to make legendaries common.
---
No, it's my turn to get downvotes!
---
They won't
---
The skins he has now is fine
---
But gifts are till 24th..so brawl talk will be around that time
---
well, you can check the player tag
---
those who entered after global have more letters and numbers, but it would be cool to know when you joined the game
---
He doesn‚Äôt even reply to you. It‚Äôs just a 9 years old liar. And if he‚Äôs over 9 years old, he‚Äôs just pathetic
---
YA Men!

Thanks So Much 12 More Days Of Mega Box
---
okay
---
"a new gift until 24th December"?
---
I just got Barley's and my first star power
---
The update is this week. They confirmed it. If there are any bugs they‚Äôll have enough time to fix it because play store will have vacation in two weeks so they gotta be fast
---
... I don't want to get wooshed, so I'll just assume this is a joke
---
Yep
---
Why is this so funny
---
Didn't you know? he will get a fan skin
---
https://make.supercell.com/en/explore
---
You got a bonus? All i got was 130 coins and some cheap power points.
---
got a star power
---
#MARIO SHOOTS FIRE UNDERWATER
---
Only Spike was the witness
---
Yeah you‚Äôre right, if they balance the game this wouldn‚Äôt be needed at all. But the problem is, they‚Äôre not taking community feedback as seriously as they should. They do take feedback, with a grain of salt.
---
Also my idea was not to ban a brawler from the whole game mode, just from a couple of maps. Thanks for letting me know your opinion on this
---
You could just ban him,if you were the co-leader or the leader of the club.And then report his messages for inappopriate behaviour.
---
She isnt overpowered bruh...you just dont know how to outplay her...I know how to outplay her even with mortis
---
When did this start?!
---
and the mega box gave you : nooooooooooooo ooooooooooooo thiiiiiiiiiii
---
ng
---
The server will overflow according to them and much of the replays under 400 are boring anyway
---
I got Carl Power Throw
---
#bruh moment
---
UwU
---
Dude this happened to me 3 times in a row... the random wasn‚Äôt bad and after getting matched up multiple times we decided to play again! Later we became friends and soon he helped me get a rank 25 Mortis!
---
He is afraid of getting squashed by bull and el primo
---
I miss that mini cartoon
---
They are avaiable for friendly matches but this is still not a replay cuz those brawlers didnt had star powers as you can see under their feet
---
I got my first mystic at 11k lol
---
Underrated post!
---
H√© is Spike...
---
Behind the Brawl Stars logo. He was peeking through the window originally
---
Look closely dude, it isn't el primo icon
---

# WHO THE HELL IS CUTTING ONIONS????
---
 Jessie‚Äôs 1. Star power
---
Wow, I did not expect to get as many upvotes as I did. Thank you for the support, I really appreciate it!
---
Meanwhile...bull is struggling on el primo's hand
---
I didn't get a mega box in the shop. Why is that?
---
wtf 8 gems thats amazing!
---
I expect an actual **free** xmas skin to be honest, it would be better than luck based boxes (imo) but i'm happy with everything.
---
&gt;this is still not a replay
---
You mean, not a friendly match?
---
Yeah
---
What did he write
---
Thats not a brawler its a mountain in the background. Smfh
---
Maybe a slight delay before penny shooting? It's a bit fast is all, but the quality (did you use finger on mobile) is impressive
---
I need it
---
Imagine them playing together lol
---
Public toe collector
---
No that's not the point I wanna go back to 666 karma SO PLEASE DOWNVOTE ME!!!
---
Something about "he apreciates my sarcasm but..." i guess after that but he said something weird
---
I got Crow a long time ago from a normal box
---
368 gold, 3 tickets, 10 gems and EMZ starpower!
---
thanks man
---
Also the brawloween skins
---
Hmmm.....i think i see the pirate icon!üòÖ
---
I don't got money, take an upvote instead!
---
I just got gold.
---
That Brock is cursed
---
No need to flex
---
I got nothing I wanted just PowerPoints and I needed 55 more el primo points for power 9 (my first power 9) but I didn‚Äôt get any and the shop had 30 therefore shop &gt; free mega box jk
---
I want to eat him üò≥
---
I got 500 coins
---
There‚Äôs a limited bull skin coming
---
I think he wanted to ask if he/she should buy the skin for crow
---
Bro there's a whole competition going to get him a new skin, go and vote at Supercell make I'm sure there are a lot of native/hunter based options
---
Bruh give them time and dont pressure them kiddo
---
wich one ! hope +20% dammage \^\^ !
---
I got A Star Power for Tara, and I thought I got lucky! Good on you man!
---
gostaria de ver uma skin da bibi, minha op√ß√£o √© a Alequina do filme esquadr√°o suicida ou Electra.
---
Thx supercell for the free MEGA BOX WOO ü§©
---
Yep this is not friendly match look under the shelly she doesnt have star power. In friendly matches everyone is at max level
---
Here hopefully I get something not complaining
---
I got 223 coins... And that was all!
---

---
# F I R T H #
---
If he doesn‚Äôt get a Pirate voice we riot!
---
I have all four legendaries (I did buy two of them) but the other two I got from boxes, still no mythics and only one epic...very epic
---
I know, i never said its a friendly match
---
I got a sp on the box after
---
No dude I just want 666 karma
---
Same with EMZ, we can‚Äôt see her heart eyes for Poco (and maybe frank)
---
Very cool
---
Its so relatable
---
&lt;insert meme template here&gt;
---
If only the mortis‚Äôs that team up with me from randoms can play like that.
---
Spikeee
---
In case for those who didn't know
---
There is also something written in pink text on a red piece of paper. I can‚Äôt make it out, too unclear
---
Thanks dude)

Looks cute and badass at the same time

I'm terrible with Carl, good job

Nice skin

If i'm not wrong, it's written "MADE YOU LOOK", for people finding any easter eggs in the image
---
Pirate brawl stars logo like the one of brawl o ween event
---
200+ coins, star points for 5 characters, 3 tickets, 200 double multiplyer
---
Ooh you lucky Boi, at 14. 1 and no mega box has gave me anything, even this free one today.. F
---
thank you‚ú®‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Haha maybe they'll bring it back
---
I got nothing. Then I opened a normal brawl box and got pam.
---
I got spike yay :)
---
I just realised that Muscle Cookie and GignerBrave are at the  back :O
---
Leon star power
---
Links to thunder Cross split attack
---
I just don't like how it's so similar to Dynamike's animation
---
Finally a believable opening
---
My friend got Sandy
---
Mecha skins are the coolest in the game
---
I pulled Leon :)
---
Is this jojo reference?
---
No like... but the cards... Leave it
---
OMG 222 COINS?! IM SO JEALOUS MAN!!! WTF!!!!
---
Spike
---
Flair does not check out
---
I think he was trying to say it has been 6 months since the last legendary they got.
---
I think that would be really good, maybe even OP
---
It did
---
Because yes, there are maps where you want brawlers banned, but still some people only play certain characters and having your favorite brawler from a map sucks
---

That's why don't auto aim.. He was mashing instead of trying to aim his super
---
who said?
---
Yep! There is a free MegaBox today!
---
I got rickrolled again again
---
Gold, Thorny Gloves, some gems and tickets!
---
made you look
---
ok zoomer
---
I rarely play mortis but when I do, I usually press auto-aim/fire. This was one of my proudest games and with a random to boot. :D
---
Oh ok
---
Soo ungrateful during the holidays
---
On 4 of my accounts I got only coins and power points but my friend gave me to unlock his mega box and he got Bibi, happy for him :)
---
Whoa ! I did not notice spike the first time I saw the image 
---
Also I got 200 doublers 8 gems and 6 or 4 tickets from the mega box that's better than getting nothing so thanks brawl stars
---
Nice find!
---
Not a legendary that's for sure
---
Thanks for the gold award btw
---
No u
---
is $30 a lot for you?
---
Lol ikr what a doofus
---
The real question is what do we get on the 25th?
---
The way spike was peeking.  I was like f*** you supercell i hate you.  And then i calmed down and commented and then......... 
---
Not everything is entertaining i am not here to entertain u just scroll and read some thing else.  Why are u wasting ur time in reading this bs realated bs
---
and we will get a bigger update if the community gives them more time
---
OK, I'll do that
---
There will be one every day until Dec 24
---
guys.....
---
i want to pat her head.
---
People are still complaining when super cell is literally giving away free stuff.. Smh
---
It appears you want takedown to be just about who can deal the most damage to the robot. 10 players surrounding the robot, everyone focused on dealing damage, and in 30sec the robot dies and basically the Brawler that has the highest dps wins. 
---
Takedown is about the strategy of the 3 possible choices: collect power cubes, damage the boss and kill other players who are likely to do more damage to the boss than you, therefore getting a better placement. Remove one of those 3 choices and you get a boring and straight-forward game mode.

Coins and points lol, and gems, tickets, and a token double. Gave me enough coins to upgrade two brawlers :)
---
Power Points, Rocket No. 4, Gems, Tickets and a Token Doubler
---
wondering why it's till the 24th?
---
Emz sure loves Poco
---
It says ‚ÄúMade you look‚Äù
---
that's just an autoaim super.
---
I got 459 coins 200 token doublers 8 gems and 6 tickets thanks brawl stars
---
I just have one question......hat or no hat?
---
Nothing because it‚Äôs a maxed account but it‚Äôs still nice to see that brawl still cares for their followers. But on the plus side! Gives me more time to save up on boxes for a potential new brawler until the update is released.
---
This same thing has happened to me multiple times and when i go into to a game the game rotates to the vertical side
---
Will an actually accurate and balanced matchmaking be one of the gifts
---
Not to nerf her super dmg but instead of 3 shot to charge 5 and de super charges it self count like 2 did I answer your question instead of complaining about how can be unplayable if she get nerf not the the dmg or health only the super charge ok...
---
Meanwhile I‚Äôm lucky if I open a box and get coins

I just want snappy sniping ;-;
---
But turrets still operate the same way regardless. A better one to put would be places Scrappy where it dies in two seconds

Best assumption is that , it's gonna be tomorrow
---
I would take both
---
Even Leon
---
Oh! Thank you!!
---
I also love GEDI and GEDI artwork.
---
Thank you very much for your help.
---
Not much but hey, who doesn‚Äôt like free stuff
---
Yes I kept creating accounts to get a legendary but still no lol
---
24th will be very late
---
I got Jessie from free mega box xD
---
LEEOOOONNN
---
Yea, they could add penny, tick and Darryl! Oh wait...
---
baby poco boi be doin the split mid air uwu  
---
yeeeee happy anniversary brawl starsssss
---
Laugh and funny have changed they're position
---
He's not pressuring supercell, he's just saying he's excited for the next brawl talk. Grow up.
---
Wait... the 12th to the 24th? GUYS IT THE 12 DAYS OF BRAWLIDAYS!!!
---
yeah
---
My big darryl main baby boi is getting recognized by the devs this is a wish come true
---
Yeah! I thought the same too,
---
Now another question
---
How do you feel about this?
---
Haha! With a brain of plant, YOU CAN'T OPEN THE DOOR!!! SCREW YOU BRAWL STARS CACTUS!!!
---
How would you know?
---
They confirmed it?
---
I got 4 legendaries on the free box at one pull.
---
Got 1up for 8-bit
---
imagine getting a legendary at 0 trophies
---
He looks like he was eating a bit too much of those healing mushrooms on rockwall brawl
---
All jokes aside a very nice picture
---
I really wish I knew about the game earlier, I didn‚Äôt see the ad ‚Äùno time to explain‚Äú on YouTube until about the month before tick came out. I still have 14.7k though
---
They already givin you free stuff from now, don't complain tho. I think they don't do Brawl Talk because of the winter/New Year/Christmas update.
---
A star power :/, I haven‚Äôt gotten a legendary since beginning of January of last year. I only have leon
---
i thought it is the update date but that will be too late
---
Brawl stars' cactus couldn't open the door!!! They survived!
---
Same like everytime... Nothing... Bc BETA PLAYER (F2P)
---
Band Aid. Although I wanted a legendary but hey, it was free. Tysm :D
---
Pulled Incendiary and 12 gems
---
Dafuq
---
I got incendiary and 12 gems lmao
---
r/unexpectedpolandball ?
---
Thanks :3
---
Not funny. Didn't laugh.
---
not bad
---
17 gems for me ;)
---
I finded leon but i can not see
---
Pam is literally a beast in there and don't even need fast movement speed, what's the point of speed if you waste most of the shot against other player. You only about 12% faster than them and they have nearly double sustained DMG. If they ignore you and focus on the boss, it's impossible to catch up. I grind in Takedown with Pam, Colt, Brock in there, even Bibi which is a very bad choice and still constantly in top 3 BY NOT WASTING MY TIME ATTACKING OTHER PLAYERS
---
Ok boomer
---
Oh it's fine, my sweet tooth is patient.
---
Just free stuff! Not complaining here!
---
Ok no one asked
---
I'm pretty sure that she's looking at Poco, because she got a photo of him on her phone in the game.
---
I mean it could be. It would make sense to wait until Christmas that way more people who will likely have just received money will spend it on Brawlstars
---
Just gold tickets gems and double tokens just yesterday I got all the power points for the rest of my non power 9 brawlers
---
Well yes, but actually nunanuahnuanhaunhah
---
*finded*
---
Because thousands of fans saying they want the update to come sooner doesnt mean that itll make the company rush the content to release them eariler?
---
You made me laugh, sugar.
---
No theair grows in any gender
---
AHA! I knew it! Piper looks like her old model because of her umbrella! That's OG Piper's umbrella!
---
This what I am trying to do but I gave up with creating up to 5 accounts lol
---
next update remodel Darryl... hmm

They already said they are not gonna rush the updates, just chill. Doesn't he have the right to want the update? He's not pressuring anyone.

Yeah because i pretty sure frank and emz are related or somthing, and last i checked supercell wasn't an alabamian company

Are you russian? Just answer.

Power points just turn into coins once you have all brawlers owned maxed.  The chance for new brawlers does not change unfortunately.

---
Just kidding as you must have looked like that when you found it
---
You sir, have used up all your luck for the next 27 years. Congratulations
---
You are a good leon, i suck with him
---

How old are you? 9?
---
Confused
---
Thicc
---
crow has really nice skins(except white) and will get a remodel he got mekka and phoenix
---
Can I change my downvotes to upvotes now?
---
They changed it on their main twitter account too, new pirateship environment and darryl remodel?
---
No god please no
---
New one looks WAY better, anyone that says otherwise can eat shit!
---
Yea, was about to say that. It's a common thing brawl stars.
---
Brawl Stars......
---

---

---
Cookie run poco
---
So cute!
---
Who knows... ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
138 powerpoints for my Sandy that was recently unlocked and Dyna's demolition star power. Shortly after obtaining Dyna's star power I open the daily two brawl boxes and got Bibi's homerun star.
---
Thanks so much, SUPERCELL.
---
P.S: Will we get free rewards all month.
---
Why is he's guitar don't wearing this "birthday hat"
---
no they won't release an update right before their vacation(and stores). they wouldn't be able to fix bugs. probably this week or after the christmas break
---
13üòâ
---
Ah i get it
---
Awesome! You got UNO pink toilet paper! Congratulation!

Let's hope üò±

461 trophy+leon.....Nice?
---
My friend at 12000 trophy no legendary
---
Me at 7000 trophy no legendary.
---
Whyyyy?????
---
If you want to make a meme write it the right way
---
Ill do that first
---
No, I think Tick said "niwefbebdbeuxbie"
---
After crow
---
And on this birthday picture we have pirate logo hidden under Frank(or I don't remember)
---
They updated their profile pic on Twitter to that
---
Wtf I just gained 4 upvotes are you up/DOWN voting?
---
*shhhhhhhhh. Don't buy. It's the brawl stars' cactus...*
---
Got 428 gold pretty nifty for the upgrades tho
---
Wann kommt das n√§chste Update raus
---
It comes when it comes
---
Was about to literally comment the same
---
Wow very good drawing
---
Thanks, I'll pay more attention in this details next time!

Thank you and happy birthday supercell
---
Gedi is back!!!
---
Which piece?
---
band-aid finally:)
---
The one circled in white
---
invisiheal for leon my favorite brawlers. Thanks supercell!
---
Wait, I shouldn't talk
---
got invisiheal
---
and 4 star tokens
---
I didn‚Äôt get anything in my big box but I got Leon in a regular one this morning! THANKS BRAWL STARS!!
---
I got two star powers from mine, could not believe it.
---
I got 2 tickets
---
In bulls defense, he doesn't have to use his super to activate his star power and his starpower won't disappear in 3 seconds
---
Btw, let's not start war between gangs
---
We shall see
---
What? I can't hear you? ARE YOU TRYING TO USE SILENCE AS SARCASM BRAWL STARS' CACTUS???
---
It's just that thing around tick's neck, I don't think is anything special
---
I Love whats mortis doing
---
I remember I read a post last week about a gamemode that has been found in the game data. This gamemode takes place in a flooded map where brawlers can still walk but their speed is reduced and there is a ship that brawlers can get on and use it's cannons too. I don't really remember the objective of the gamemode but if you type something like "new gamemode" and sort by new you should find it.
---
So there is a Bull and Darryl gangs?
---
coolio
---
I would REALLY appreciate if you guys the ones that upvoted would downvote my comments...
---
Also I'm not a downvote farmer I just REALLY want to get 666 karma... so please

they should give xtra exp and hope they add a exp road

6 gems, whats up!

Ora ora ora, um brasileiro por aqui

I think only players who main Shelly for everything like Shelly‚Äôs super, it should be super nerfed.
---
Cool!
---
Kairos brawl theorie is so accurate
---
Supercell officially shipping Emz and Poco
---
Is also on YouTube
---
Not bad eh.
---
(I don't think that someone would actually understand this reference)
---
How the heck do you have crow before some mythicals.
---
its worse when you  exit after being carried by a random (IMPOSSIBLE) and then press exit and play but now the random that carried u r on the opposing team and you know youre screwed
---
I‚Äôm in
---
Thanks for the mega box BEFORE the release of a new brawler... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Ok but he will have less life to fight, Darryl can rush with his super and have a shield for the whole fight
---
can you post the link to the post?
---
Whats wierd about this is that if you try to play on the mini screen the touch controls are off. You have to imagine that small screen on the rest of the touch screen. Very frustrating to try and play through. Been having this problem for over a week. The phone I am using is a Galaxy Note 9
---
For me that mega box was very kind because i got only 5 items but 2 bonus items 7 tickets and 20 gems  :).Thanks Brawl Stars
---
why won't a lower level account save up 1000 coins to get mega boxes that could get them new brawlers? leveling up lower level brawlers costs very little. supercell would go bankrupt if they offer mega boxes for coins because nobody would ever have the incentive to use $ to buy boxes again
---
BRAWL STARTS SUCKS *jk*
---
BUT PLEASE *DOWNVOTE* MEEE
---
Found it. It's called "shipwreck". Type it in the research and sort by new and the fist post is the one with all the info. Can't wait
---
I got 5 gems
---
Yes, that's it. The pirates update is coming
---
Psychopaths, shelly, Poco and colt decapitated spike
---
Also, good art
---
Its poco since it was kinda discovered she loves him...when you select her and rotate her you can see pocos icon on her phone
---
I got bad karma :)
---
Anime jessie...
---
before it was frank with a heart in the corner
---
Who the next gift??
---
Same, but no one cares that i got 5 items remaining
---
Enjoy the award even tho it gives you nothing
---
Missing ryan in the bottom right
---
*silence*
---
I got frank :D
---
Sam, can u make "Hobbit", "Goblin", "Cyclop", "Centaur" or any mythical creature skin on any brawler? :)
---
bow check
---
Am i the only one that thinks that that shadow at the door might be a new brawler?
---
The game files
---
Yes
---
The only player is kim jong un
---
made you &amp; look ?? i have no idea
---
How??
---
Today on my small acc got 7 items
---
I‚Äôm surprised gene could say something that smart
---
Download the optional update in the store ;)
---
How dare you! Fight my GUNBRELLA YOU CACTUS!!!
---
What's mortis doing there???
---
It could be a christmas pirate update hmmm
---
Emz Can't take her eyes of the one on her phone
---
Bibi!
---
But look at the door
---
Would be cool for sure. I love stats and checking them. I'd like to have any kind of them: winrate, damage dealt, accuracy, supers charged. Anything goes for me haha.
---
The red party stuff says brawl talk tomorrow?
---
Yep!
---
Just a little pat
---
Dont Say that LMFAO!!!
---
10000000000000.../10 smash
---
You guys are getting free stuff
---
It says brawl talk tomorrow.My bro told me
---
New pirate and sea enviroment or a new gamemode that is pirate-lated
---
It actually says "Make you look" the dev troll us because they knew we're gonna take a look for hints. Well played dev.
---
Leon:
---
When i exit out the app it increases my phones resulion and makes all the apps look smaller on screen
---
But then they suddenly become good. Then you check replays and realize you didn't get matched with the same guy and you realize that you don't pay attention to peoples IGNs that much and only notice what brawler and skin they use
---
I got 400, though I also got 10 tickets and 15 gems
---
**shoots*
---
"TUIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT"
---
And i got Sandy :)
---
Kill me

that link is corrupt

---
My birthday happens to be the same
---
Imagine a brawler who needs to waste a super to activate his star power.
---
What about weapon skin? I'd rather being attacked by a too cold milkshake than a too hot vodka
---
A poop
---
The choice is pretty obvious
---
This reminds me of a time i played twice with a really good random el primo in power play
---
IG too
---
Wooooow
---
They doesn't updated profile picture for the long time(except world finals)
---
The profile pic is on IG as well
---
I thought of saying that too but rip, this gift is inernational unless you dont open it which would be stupid.
---
Poco is Emz crush (if you look at Emz phone in the game, you will see poco)
---
Do you believe in magic?
---
Sounds like 5v5 or club wars
---
Is very cute
---
Darryl needs the shield to push another brawler bro
---
Install the optional update from the Google Play Store. It's out for about a week now.
---
STOP FUCKING OWOUWU
---
And btw the super auto regen so this Is fine
---
Gibus Mortis
---
Woah this looks like something straight outta Cookie Run
---
It is official now that Emz has a crush on Poco
---
Same
---
Yea this is weird, they added tick before (which is a pirate) and have added while new themes without changing their profile picture
---
Btw it literally has 2 upvotes
---
If you truly are giving away a free gift every day for 12 days (12 days of Christmas style?) then thank you!  It‚Äôs about time you gave back to us.  The last free bonus you gave us was a bundle of power points for female brawlers like 8 or 9 months ago... and since then it‚Äôs been a one-sided affair of us giving you our money.
---
I look forward to a gift with increasing value every day culminating with the release of an amazing update on Christmas morning! 
---
Day 1: mega box
---
Day 2: 100 tickets?
---
Day 3: 2000 token doubler?
---
Day 4: 200 gems?
---
Day 5:  free skin of our choice?
---
Day 6: new brawler?
---
Day 7: power point bundle (500 any brawler)?
---
Day 8: 3 mega boxes?
---
Day 9: 3000 coins?
---
Day 10: another free skin?
---
Day 11: another new brawler!?
---
Day 12: 2 free star powers of our choice? 
---
Christmas!: holiday package of Christmas themed things to purchase in shop.

That's not my point. Even if 8-Bit could melt Mortis on this map, Mortis could just focus Piper and then all it would take is Emz peeking, and 8-Bit is dead. I don't see why were still arguing, as my battle log clearly says; Defeat
---
BRO I would buy a Gingerbread Man Poco in a heartbeat.
---
. #ChristmasFilter
---
How does your text get so big?
---
How is Brawl Talk?
---
***Me***
---
LOL, 4k ultra hd!)))
---
430 coins for me :)
---
I only need star powers an 2 legendaries...
---
I think that's Horus Bo and Spike. But the Poco really does look like it could be inspired from the game.
---
By posting a message. Someone posted a screenshot on this subreddit
---
That‚Äôs the point ;-;
---
i really want some brawl stars official animated series just like the ones supercell did for clash of clans
---
*cries in Pam*
---
start a sentence with #
---
It's Poco,  can't be Frank since Frank is her uncle's friend
---
i got crow from a free mega box. My firat legendary/ mythic ever @9k trophies! :D
---
Try to talk with the support
---
Global one year ago: 1st Guy 16200 trophies.
---
Me now: 17k.
---
WTF
---
#***ok, thx***
---
#***ey no problem***
---
3 gems üëç
---
Nothing.
---
I hope so. Darryl is fun too play but the awkward silence gets kind of dull
---
That small sticker on the side of Frank's booth is the skull logo eith an eyepatch. The Twitter logo for Brawl Stars also changed to it.
---
Look at my newst post...
---
It's written MADE YOU LOOK
---
see the date lmao it's of November
---
but they got the middle star!
---
I don't have crow
---
a user has uploaded  a more clear picture  some hours ago. it definitely says made you look.
---
If you have other ideas please share it
---
and poco is looking at frank, new ship!
---
Well, something interesting will come....
---
The two are both really unlikely to come in this update, but let's hope for the best
---
#I scrolled down and I watched literally 7 posts about this.
---
I had that today
---
I see the latter, not the former.
---
Mind if I yoink dancing tara for a future meme?
---
Alright boys. Get flencing!
---
Supercell please make this real
---
For most players in the game these aren't useless
---
He is a chameleon....he camuflage...
---
Pirates are thieves, christmas is coming, the grynch stole christmas. New game mode about stealing gifts is coming.
---
Well, they do that every week, even two times pero week
---
i didnt get power points i wanted
---
Pirates in Christ mas ...... Why though???
---
and a pirate skin for Gene!
---
I got a Star Power out of this, how awesome.
---
I hope it‚Äôs the original version of the game
---
I got a passive for Mortis, but I haven\`t any legendary brawler and I am sitting on 13300 tropheys). Yea you are lucky
---
Merry Christma-SIKE!
---
Poor 8bit, he's born outdated.
---
Only if you really want the skin. Seems like they may be draining people‚Äôs gems before they drop new skins with all these sales.
---
Amazing art!! Also it's just skins that weren't in beta really like that part
---
Pirate ubdate soon?
---
I got coins
---
darryl remodel
---
Wow thanks for posting this! How would we have ever known if it wasn't for you posting this? Pure genius . /s
---
Nobody cares.
---
ok boomer
---
Leons just invisible in the pic right?
---
Same but i dun have a brawler over power7 at 9.3k
---
Penny, Pam, and Darryll haven't had a remodel yet.
---
#ZA DARMO!!!
---
Bro i don‚Äôt even know, my luck is very weird in this game. I‚Äôm very stoked nonetheless tho haha
---
there is another red thing near the glasses on the top of the image
---
i says something, and with zoom the last thing i can read its like "leon"
---
maybe nerf for leon? ahahah
---
Nice! Which ones?
---
I got sandy lol it seems everyones having luck with the free mega box today
---
Sign I meant
---
Its me cake day too
---
Spike doesn't now how to talk so that's why hes not in the party
---
Judging by the Twitter avi change, this week
---
How many trophies and sides the longer you wait the better the chance
---
I think it would be similar to tick's
---
Only when you ask for free legendaryes lmao
---
Starpower for me
---
Wow, it's almost as if, when people are in the same skill level, they perform equally, unless there is a power difference. The use/win rates alone should inform you that this is an unfair match. Especially with how slow 8-Bit is.
---
Or could be Frank
---
Next brawler will be Poco and Emz child = Pomz XD
---
My sister got sandy
---
if it followed the twelve days of christmas song, tomorrow we'd get two small box and a mega box again
---
Steel Hoops!
---
Oof, I feel strange because now I can just get 4 items in my mega boxes cause I‚Äôm almost maxed out. I‚Äôve fking opened 4 mega boxes recently and didn‚Äôt get anything
---
Haha. That‚Äôs always the worst when you‚Äôre very close to hitting power 9 but the game refuses to give you any power points
---
Thank you,u/brawlstars.
---
Ryan announces new skin: and its called... 
---
Sis is coming for ya!
---
I got nothing except 470 gold and 1 ticket.
---
I didn't even got star power
---
No.
---
Dam dude i still got like 40 left
---
What if those are his voice lines
---
I thought if a person has negative karma he cant comment or post?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/e9kqiy/happy_birthday_brawl_stars_make_sure_to_check_the/
---
Why not post a comment on this as its got lots of attention.
---
The star power aint bad but the legendarys, good luck with that
---
True
---
I like the idea and skin itself but............in this pose she looks drunk
---
Chunks would load when i gave the word
---
Thank you :)
---
Mortis is a living meme and Supercell only reinforces that fact
---
And tomorrow is my bday :D
---
Yeah it will be a couple years before I get a legendary lol
---
Just a Chief Pat
---
i got nothing on my main and poco on one i just created.
---
Darryl must be getting his remodel
---
Tbh once you get all the power points for your current brawlers getting 2000 becomes much easier
---
Is there a big update teaser on this picture like what does that sign say and what it behind the door?
---
‚ÄúKills an enemy‚Äù
---
#*has a voice*
---
I got 250 coins and 8 gems
---
Idk what to even say, but this isn‚Äôt the type of game where I go out of my way to photoshop something for. I don‚Äôt even have photoshop
---
üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
---
Poor little dude. I feel bad for him, got him in the megabox...
---
Oh i didn‚Äôt noticed she was looking at poco like that.
---
What about em
---
its for pirate SEASON, like season 1 battlepass
---
Its u/the worst bot
---
Awesome concept!!!
---
Leon looks dope!!
---
Wham Wham Bam Bam here here comes comes Pam Pam
---
You find spike?
---
I think its the worst bot
---
He should get the pirate from SpongeBobs voice!
---
We were talkin about another thingüëç
---
Imagine if they accidentally wrote slay race instead of sleigh race.
---
Is this bull‚Äôs bar ?
---
no idiots its spongebob
---
Laughs in Darryl\*
---
that means white crow will get a full remodel with possible name change (like golden rico)
---
alright
---
thats so cute
---
I got El Primo doing this (I‚Äôm going tuo max shelly and then use she)
---
mortis would be OP in it since you know...
---
screen, but I've already found it elsewhere. thanks anyway.
---
Favorite pirate?? That's definitely Penny!!
---
Your the very last person who discovers this
---
No it's Eric Simpson from Ren &amp; Eddy
---
11 gems
---
Piper is actually decent in brawl ball if you know how to use her, wouldn‚Äôt be a surprise if this guy didn‚Äôt know how. But you were all at the same trophy level, so....
---
8-bit has range advantage, and reload advantage on Emz, but auto aim won‚Äôt get you far. 
---
If your standing together and get team wiped by a Emz, you probably deserved it, and should learn not to group together. 
---
Supercell should take I to count trophies, but I don‚Äôt see that applying to this game you posted. Your all low level brawlers. And my complaint with them is that they have players in games with brawler trophies that are 2,4,5,600 trophies difference. All of the players in this game were about even. 
---
Powers level shouldn‚Äôt be taken into count with matchmaking, because skill trumps power level almost every time. 
---
Piper can 2 shot a Crow, Colt, Tick, Dynomike, Barley, not sure who else. But being able to 2 shot a player isn‚Äôt an issue. The issue comes when you don‚Äôt know how to take advantage of your brawlers abilities. 
---
And at no level should someone be able to 2 shot a grouped team? Ummmm, more like no team should be grouped because you can get team wiped. 
---
I team wiped with a Dynomike super because the guys grouped together. Was a Nita, Tick, and Penny. Hit the Penny and Nita at the same time with my first shot, they grouped together, and hit them all with my super. Teams shouldn‚Äôt be grouped together. Obvious noob move.
---
BRAWLERS OF THE CARRIBEAN, GOES ON CINEMA NEXT WEEK
---
and a pirate brawler
---
Ora Ora Ora, temos um BR Aqui...
---
Alright, you can call me a bad player when you send me a video of you playing mortis, with no super charged, against a bandaid Shelly without her super charged, I PROMISE if it's a ranked showdown you WILL lose. I'm at 18000 trophies and I've pushed mortis to 750 trophies SEVERAL times, and I KNOW that he is useless against a Shelly if I don't have my super charged, or if there isn't a box, or even if the Shelly has bandaid. Idiot.
---
Who is Brawl Talk
---
Wow what a deep thought
---
Its shelly
---
yeah LOL
---
I thought she was looking at Fra-a-a-a-ank
---
Yeet, thanks!
---
\*cries in 8-bit\*
---
Ok
---
How did you think he got so strong
---
And i commented 'bout Piper on your post
---
Why does it say "2nd legendary"
---
I got 3 golden chests and 2019 gold for free. I don't know why.
---
Especially boss fight ones
---
they changed the shop when carl was already in game
---
Laughs in has been saving gems and has 379
---
It says 1 year ago my dude lmao. Carl was added in like march
---
I knew there was some teaser in the image thank now my sense can rest, or can it?
---
Since the remodel arrived.
---
Well that was 10 seconds I won't get back
---
#NoseBleed
---
Buy a brawler instead
---
that is so true
---
Me with 2 legendaries at 14k trophies üòâ
---
I‚Äôm colorblind
---
Yeah same...
---
Matchmaking is based on your brawlers trophies. If it was based on your total trophies than a 6000 player could have gotten a new brawler and you are the same team with them because they are 6000 trophies.
---
Me too, it was spike
---
Deserted Vertex 2
---
Wow, your opinion is shit
---
Lol I'll still davr money and buy it
---
Same on my second account I got frank from the brawl box

Nice, how long did this take?

Well you have a legendary! Thats better than none
---
well i got üÖ±Ô∏èüÖ±Ô∏è
---
Removed.
---
Rule 5. Repetitive or low effort posts with a low discussion potential will be removed.
---
It was removed from friebdly matches in the ‚Äúbrawl stars tiniest update‚Äù because it was buggy . Idk what the bug was but somethinf along those lines was said on the patchnotes
---
I think Penny would also laugh
---
Lmao, I had gotten Leon (my last champ) and then sandy was released. One day this video will be truth!
---
Me neither lmao
---
Nice drawing !
---
Suggest colouring it in
---
I am actually that fourth panel
---
(CHAIN COMING?) 
---
Hey, Jotaro are you approaching me?
---
thats barley
---
Great effort, this looks nice now it‚Äôs coloured
---
Also,
---
r/rule34 would like to know your location
---
oh but they should add it back
---
This completely based on my headcanon. Everyone thinks different here
---
Is not 100, is 11
---
Into the fire!
---
I agree, if we could see when the update is we would be happy, but if there is a delay and they tell us, that's cool, at the end of the day their the ones making the gaming better why would we complain.
---
wait what i never agreed to this
---
Nice drawing
---
#sun
---
wait what i would never say that I'm not interested in lolis
---
Thank you for you aprovationüòéüëçcan you share mi idea to others if you idea and if you share that help me a lot‚ò∫.
---
you're logic is way off. when you buy a mega box with 1000 coins, you cannot just naively say you're losing 500 coins of progress when getting power points and coins is progress in itself. you cannot equate 1 powerpoint to 2 coins when doing this conversion. players currently have no method of gaining a large amount of power points and a mean to unlock new brawlers except the marginal chances with normal and big boxes. with mega boxes being able to purchase with coins, it essentially costs nothing to the players because they would have no other ways to spend the coins anyway. mid-level players have excessive coins when they don't have enough power points for an upgrade, hence they use coins to buy powerpoints. the reason why Supercell limits only one mega box to be purchased by star points follows the same logic, where gems become obsolete when you can recycle through coins.
---
literally me. And i dont have piper and gene
---
There‚Äôs gonna be absolutely nothing replay-worthy at 0 trophies cuz most people you face will be fairly new
---
I did. I have no regrets even tho I had the default Mecha Crow. I was around the same gem count as you
---
I feel like it should have a little more cover otherwise squishies will get wrecked quick.
---
I won the match but i dont have enogh space on my phone to record..soo thats sad.
---
:(
---
Idk
---
Magic puffs. It offers so much value for your team. Gene's DMG isn't hight anyway. 1700 DMG that three taps a Shelly is basically nothing
---
 looks like he/she has a Hammer but Frank Is WAY BIGGER
---
Don't compare me to gods
---
Just thought that new star power will come next summer same as this summer. but they were just testing them. But OK :(
---
What? Steve has a happy face and the uno cards have a happy face!
---
Just got god damned gold and super power for gene. No legendary. All brawlers are full... No legendaries not even god damn 1.
---
Thanks: in my second account I found Carl in the free megabox today
---
Cast it into the fire supercell
---
Wrong Mecha Crow&lt;Phoenix Crow. And it's a great deal too üòä
---
YES
---
Are we getting free mega boxes every day?!
---
thats adorable
---
EMZ: f*cking b*tch, he is mine!
---
I got 7 skips, but only 3 star powers (still hapoy because I needed them for power play)
---
is this a spoiler or something
---
i cant beat the s#!t out of you without getting close
---
interesting idea, that boy be *t h i c c  a f* tho
---
Better the all the heist maps we have right now
---
Whats your headcannon ?
---
In my 1st account anything, but in my 2nd i get Carl
---
4 teaming STUPID primos*
---
Im not complaining
---
really cool
---
looks awesome
---
Hi, not bad.
---
I didn't said saving boxes increases the chance to gain a brawler, I said saving boxes is better to increase the chances, mass opening is good
---
I know they keep raping my gf
---
OoOO ShOwDoWn yOu UnSkILL yoU muST pLaY iN 3 oN 3
---
Now that's a lot of candy
---
Trophy road expansion, you will see.
---
And they happen to be my two favorite brawlers so it makes me more than happy to see them together officially
---
feel ya there on that last one
---
no way this is fake
---
Getting 400 on a brawler is practically free anyways
---
Nice slippers
---
thats the day where we stop getting mega boxes
---
Thank you
---
4/4 legendaries at 7k... I fucking quit
---
#yes that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs christmas eve
---
Oh yeah that's big brain time
---
I bought two of them
---
oh. sorry. I didnt realize. I dont celebrate christmas.
---
Small box?
---
bruh all i got was gems
---
I am on the fourth league and I got incendiary for brock
---
Frank is salty it got leaked
---
Same, 22k trophies :(
---
Plus, sometimes when you get hit by Darryl's super, you got knockback twice
---
nice sock u got there boi
---
Same, 34k trophies :(
---
This is a super cool idea
---
Barley xd
---
Uh what r u do have sczinophrenia
---
Joe mama
---
You know in the picture u/brawlstars sent out, EMZ had those hearty eyes for our man poco.
---
ALSO WE DONT HAVE SANDY, EMZ, 8-BIT FLAIR, BO AND PRIMO IMAGE HAVE OLD PIC, BUT YOU THINK ONLY ABOUT PIPER
---
bru@h
---
That's me
---
She's 5
---
No, the link doesn't exist mate
---
No need for all caps tho :(
---
literally nothing besides coins and powerpoint... at least I got tix and token doubler
---
I liked the voice lines but I would still keep some argh's
---
I am confused but ok
---
I agree. I don‚Äôt even have one,but I could get every brawler to max except for emz.
---
I knew it would come to this...
---
I don‚Äôt want to sound mean, but o feel like you could have done a lot better.
---
This is inaccurate I'm 14.5k and have no where near all characters points
---
We need it to be a free brawler!
---
Yeah I know
---
14.5 and no legendary
---
We all know it‚Äôs gonna happen
---
I am happy
---
*Record screech*
---
HAH! NO
---
*Sigh* yeah I know,
---
Or a 
---
*angry* yeah I know...
---
Where did you get the boom box image?
---
8 event tickets
---
Nita has a fucking stand
---
Well we got free barley, last year maybe free brawler currently in game?
---
LV9 Rico
---
Yo everyone in here, this is also possible with manual aim. So shut up about your ‚ÄújUsT doNt AuToAIm‚Äù
---
El primo has an interesting head.. ü§î
---
Neither cause I know I could do better so I can handle the criticism
---
And we do have 8-bit
---
Darryl
---
Same here, but i'm at 12000 trophies
---
I get nothing and then I get Tara right after in a normal box
---
**IT'S YOU**
---
Proceds to epicly point his finger at the camera
---
The same exact thing happens to me and my friends, say one of us has the highest amount of trophies with a brawler at 500, then the rival team will have around 600 each, if one of us has 600, they have 700. Tought we were the only ones having this issue!
---
Hey stop copying my comment ideas buddy
---
*Oh Ho!*
---
#Then come as close as you like!
---
Nice 3 gems man!
---
Oh...
---
Phew...
---
I don‚Äôt like being mean, and I felt like what I said was very mean. 
---
I can be a total angry boi  if I am angry, but I am not angry, so being a angry boi isn‚Äôt easy...
---
It would atmost be an uncommon brawler
---
Maybe! I didn‚Äôt thought about them
---
Wow, you've just discovered hot water.
---
I like this ship
