He got sandy today From a box he Said it in the chat

That is differnet. Thats intentional
---
No

Ye but its techniques. Ull see more of that in higher trophies
---
I can't show all the brawlers in someone's profile
---
Then starting ag game will take forever to start if someone has bad wifi. We want quick, fast, fun games, not 10 minute waits.
---
Oh really. Preventing with a super instead of just a normal attack, which would give him more damage points, plus, Colt didn’t had any power cubes, when he had 4. I kinda see the issue here.
---
We all know who gedi kor is
---
Yesn't
---
Aren’t they different drawings? This one has lines in the background and the artists name, but the one you linked doesn’t have lines and is empty. Admittedly, they do look similar, but I don’t think it’s stolen.
---

---
Edit: oops never mind looks like they just edited the lines on there and the name
---
It'd look weird with purple eyebrows, thats just how the artists draws
---
The Ike bot can now see you normally in its circle. The invisibility working on the Ike was removed because it was too powerful
---
Pretty sure he gave up
---
good symmetry, good layout, I'd give this map a 10/10 would recommend
---
I don't check brawlers that I don't have
---
I was about to downvote this but I saw you credit the artist. Next time though, credit the artist in the Title
---
Go collect some power cubes then? And I never said that Brock was smart, it seems like they autoaimed the super

Only 6 upvotes.... You should get like 200 for this meme art.

You probably should delete this post. "Stealing" post on this SubReddit makes people really angry. even if you think it looks cool put the creator's name or else everyone will think you are stealing.

Ohh I didn’t notice

Bro. You’re like the 9 year olds saying “GIVE ME SANDY OR LEON FOR FREE!”
---
Don’t complain about a game being unfair because you haven’t gotten something from the game. I haven’t gotten Crow or Spike yet. I’m nearly at 10k. Who cares if o haven’t gotten them yet!? I don’t. Because only time will tell when I get them!
---
Don’t judge the fairness of a game based on what you get and how often you get it.
---
That primo didn't even tried to juke

that's a different thing, and is rare content.

When shellys super used to actually take skill to use
---
They need to fix the star system for lone star. You could get 3 kills and if one person kills you they’re just one star away from you in position. I feel they need to reduce the star rewards a little.
---
No u
---
Because everyone is a professional and needs updoots for their self-esteem.
---
Why do they call 7th to 5th place “doing okay”? Is losing 4 trophies okay?

It”s pretty much telling you “This is fine.”

Head Canon: After the “Story Mode” of Brawl Stars, Brock and his Wife (Piper in my books) look older and this is what Brock Looks like and he does one of his old victory animations while being the new owner of the dance club/saloon he used to work at where he met Piper (Waitress and Hostess) and worked with Poco (Live Music) and Barley (Saloon Owner/Bar Tender)

Poor Rico

He tried his best

If he was at 400 cups and had 3 of them than he most definitely bought them...
---
I unfriended my friend because last week someone told me he "8-shit".
---
thanks Grammer is important
---
Wow, my mind is in pain now. Do they just give up and let the imaginary forces take hold of their bodies? What the heck have I done...
---
Maybe he’s behind the cake
---
One problem is that since the minions will home in onto the nearest target, then sometimes you have no way to kill the people you need to kill
---
2 boxes a day + a mega box every other day + who knows how much more from ticketed events each week. Add onto that token doublers, trophy road rewards and token rewards for leveling up and ranking up and you've got a nice flow of currency. Supercell knows what they are doing. If progression is too fast, not only will they lose money, but the progression system becomes essentially pointless.
---
"But"
---
Removed. Rule 3. No providing information on how to break Supercell Terms of Service.
---
1. Bot is an unofficial gamer term for a horrible, bad, or under skilled  player. I'm not referring to an autonomous program(ing) on a network.
---
2. Most people by 12k would or should know how to assess a new characters in or within 10 games. They might not be able to master them but that can atleast spot the strengths and weaknesses of a new brawler. From there you just have to tailor a play style that best fits you and your brawlers capabilities.
---
I mentioned that these players also don't care or take the time to learn the strength and weaknesses of the other brawlers. If they did they could go into a fight against any team and predict the plans or roles of each combatant. Like harrasser, collector, dps-ers, flankers, cordons, pushers and many more.
---
Wow
---
This trend got old for me real quick
---
Oh you meant bot not bot but still you expect them to become pros
---
Yeah you're right I was only telling you that because I wanted to know why you didn't love this idea I'm just really angry that I have 13 brawlers ready to get maxed I was just suggesting this idea but anyways you're right we shouldn't get more coins
---
Good thing I finally moved up a grade to escape that war
---
This other players can only do one thing to help this issue. That is to take the time hone their skills with other brawlers, look up meta strategies, or make their own if applicable.
---
oops...

Thank you all! Enjoy your karma points!

I dont mind getting killed. You can obviously kill other players, but I'm getting matched with people who make it their life's goal to kill everybody and it's annoying
---
Of course. You’ve been trying to get Shelly for your mom; continuing the family blood, eh?
---
Yeah, she takes forever to unlock.
---
Thnx☺️☺️☺️

You should totally make more art of brawler fusions, this looks amazing

Wait there is a skin challenge for this? What website is it on... anyone know?
---
Me: Picks Piper
---
Piper: *Oh, great, not this guy again*
---
Attacking the other players so that they can’t deal damage to the bot giving you the upper hand
---
It's on Instagram, hosted by @magiisky but all the slots might be full now, so the only thing you can do is look forward to the posts I guess

How do you lose 10 games in a row? I want to learn this power!

Thx dude and yeah i know and otherwise you have you ideas for my next post?

Brawler fusions used to be cool just like Mortis kill throwers 
---
But since everyone posted the same thing it became stale
---
Wait, ur telling me you have to team to kill leon? If you do, you must be really bad. He is so easy to kill (if youre not a bsd player of course)
---
i can imagine Supercell cloning the brawlers, shove them in boxes and put them on a conveyor belt for each player
---
We can ignore each other, i wont bother you
---
Hey did you get to see my squirrel skin concept I made for Leon?

Check it out on my profile if not.

Let me know what you think.

i have actually fucking seen more posts telling people to stop doing brawler fusions rather than the brawler fusions themselves

Why’d that piper get close to you lol

Ah yes i remember that now
---
Why is this so true
---
I like this skin, the lolipop throws off the seriousness of the tuxedo in a lighthearted, childish manner!

i thought they removed shelly

There's never just gonna be s single one of these,even I made one, it's the most popular skin idea for Halloween
---
Nice
---
There is no Easter egg?.?.?.
---
So your new main ;)
---
This has to be fake.
---
don't forget the "super fusion"
---
You have to kill people, unless you are a kamikaze brawler, because if you can't then how do I get more powerups huh?
---
This reminds me, is there something like stats Royale but for brawl stars to see what drops there are?
---
Thank you :3
---
Thanks !
---
Spike is so good
---
Well it's an opportunity every Halloween, who knows when supercell will decide to add it?
---
Oof.Thats the algorithm here.Cant do nothing about it.

Yes ! I feel i am playing mw2 when I 360 quickscope with piper
---
A) although the update did catalyze the time it takes to reach this threshold, it is still not easy to reach 15k. It still takes a tremendous amount of man hours and devotion to the game. B) saw your profile and 18d ago you were below 15k too so don’t act like your the hot shit and undermine the achievement of reaching that amount. C) Maybe gold Mecha Bo and Crow are a bit much and should be replaced with White Mecha Bo and Crow, IDK. Either way there should be something more than Mega boxes and measly coins at the end of the trophy road and an exclusive trophy road reward skin would be pretty cool.
---
Then you probably are dumber than what I originally thought
---
A common way of referencing an unknown or undefined gender, although it may not be correct, is to use the male pronouns.
---
I did not know she was romanian
---
Really ? 
---
At what total trophy range are you playing ? I could share a replay of my battle logs but I can't post pics or vids in the comments
---
Around 800 trophies
---
Guys... (You know the drill.)
---
This idea is absolute garbage. For me and other players who've been saving star points for so long just so that these skins can be given at 15k is horrid. Have you heard my idea on how to get these skins? It's called playing the game.
---
Double same 😡
---
Latin American here, never heard it before. I think you’re good
---
I believe that was the point
---
IT comes with titles ?
---
Mark it as NSFW
---
I couldn't care less if the robots had either or non-binary, it's the devs choice. So let me rephrase my question since you didn't get the memo; when you are in-game with randoms playing as a Bibi against a Piper, would the outcome be different if either were portrayed to have testicles?
---
Maybe switching new and old would be better because they are switched but pretty good overall
---
crow: i will pretend that i didn't see that
---
5 000 000 is so much! It needs to be like 2 000 000

The mortis probably be spinnig and trolling or so on for like forever b4 finishing the dynamike off

This map... im sorry, but it was _weirdly_ done. I mean... why there so many wall in front of spawn??? How would my piper shoot??? ;-;
---
maybe you accidently bought the jessie +brock akin offer
---
Louding
---
Yes, i really hope it's back. I need people to die quick. And i bet a lot of people will play tank due to fear of 'low health'.
---
If you couldn't care less why are you getting into a fight about it? The fact that we're on a subreddit means the game experience isn't limited to the game. So how about you stop acting so puritan about the fact that people want a variety of characters?
---
N I B A
---
me: have 46 gems and only can buy one of these 2 skins discounted
---
supercell: released both of these skins in one offer

How do you guys even do this

---
Wow bester shop ich weiß das du deutsch bist
---
Piper will be an instant win tho
---
Not a glitch. His name is probally ???, because then it hides it
---
If you are going to buy more gems then yes. If not, then no. The reason is simple, halloween is near, most likely we will see new skins based on halloween so make sure that you are getting what you want exactly.
---
Years? Phmmhhhh
---
Bruh—it’s stolen guys
---
Sorry, for shit quality my phone is a potato
---
Haha no problem !
---
But yes, the thing is he can kinda fit in many groups so it's hard to tell honestly. I wish Supercell could give us some lore on the characters since some of them seem obviously related, it would be a nice addition

This is adorable! Keep up the good work!

Happy cake day

Wait what mode?
---
Yes,But this is a ranking based on how rich they are,If a brawler literally shoots gold,they should be pretty tich

TOTALLY BALANCED (honestly wth this would break the game)

I bought a mega box for 49 gems a few days ago, got really pissed at myself today because i could've gotten this instead getting nothing useful :(

Im 17k but dont think that matters, anyway the games are for sure quicker but not sub-1m quick everytime
---
nooo thats like in hayDay. it isnt fun
---
Yea, but you could also unlock everything without paying, you just need to play longer, i played long enough to buy the strongest sword and with it you were op, you could win most of the games with just the sword, well but others who had the best variant of everything could still easily kill you tho

Yes!

8 hit earns his money by letting the kids play games on him

^ok

If you watch OG’s takedown video, all his games went over 1 minute and he even played his 900+ 8bit

Trophy road

Aww zero two

Your not wrong. People say it’s not at rare now because of how common you see it. I’d give it 2 years and seeing people with that skin will be a rare occasion

Hinge is a paper clip cut to fit and hot glued in place.
---
actually i think bee sniper just refers to the piper with new icon. because i saw a file called skins.csv and bee sniper was right in between sandy and the barley skin(red one)
---
Awesome!
---
Nice, which one? Ill go post this there tomorrow morning, i dont have the highest hopes of it even getting into the game but its a better place to have this stuff.
---
I suddenly felt pity for Barly :(
---
This isn't tumblr
---
I made coarse course:) good luck for your map!!
---
Aw fuck  no

## *King Rico intensifies*
---
I see so many with this skin. Was there some kind of event to get it for free that I missed?
---
Wait wha
---
can dis be a meme please
---
For his neutral special, Leon wields a gun.
---
Good idea!

Good idea, too! XD

I won my first legendary in the 5000 trophies megabox,it's lucky

Sure,heres mine

then tf do you want? reload speed buff, damage buff, super healing buff, coiled snake back to 3 secs?
---
I think I have an idea about name)
---
Imagine running in to Shelly with your entire team and blaming the game.
---
It is a double penis
---
Oh my bad I meant report. Also reporting someone will most likely get them banned for a short period of time
---
Why it is a bug?

If you want a real Tier List that shows for fact who is best, I just made a nwe post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/da2s23/tier\_list\_survey/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/da2s23/tier_list_survey/)

Although I do agree that Poco is a homeless F tier
---
jsjsjsjs
---
Just my opinion but maybe the tires on the side are a bit much?
---
Put jump pads in the water you can only get to by jumping
---
Said the retarded kid.
---
nice! could you do a rico and dynamike next pls
---
I'll become rich Y E S. Now give me Sandy, I've already lost about 150 Brawl Boxes to him.
---
*stonks*
---
Happy cake day 😁
---
Haha Thanks
---
This just made me realize Poco is basically Brook from One Piece without a sword
---
Ya it took me years to get her I heard that it was an ultra legendary and it was 0.000000000001% by supercell
---
This is a great idea. Supercell have this on a lot of their games. This would make Brake Stars so much better!
---
Black and white balls
---
Yes I know there are different types of maps for each mode. Just imagine a fricken typical map for that mode and average your opinions.
---
Nice, maybe you call it "Double Arrows" :)

Your probably a just bait account.
---
Its still not rare after 9 months wich is very dissappointing
---
I’ve tested, the pet doesn’t fly over walls. The most obvious thing you could have said is that the current model being used is a placeholder
---
Colt on Takedown

Thanks for your kind words :)

I appreciate it.

Check out my profile if you have time for a few other pieces of my fan art for this game.

Let me know which ones you like :D
---
Have an awesome day!

U sure

That's why Poco is my favorite, he is just like me
---
That’s right. You made a high quality photo with an amazing idea!

Nice one.

I don't post anything on re edit

But now the year is gone and just says Brawlidays.

I want this
---
That is so sad El Primo play the Brawl Stars losing theme.
---
I'm sorry the video is not clear. https://youtu.be/_NGUg31cIW4
---
Can I ask for your permission to use your picture with an idea of mine ?
---
I will post it with credit to your artwork in title.
---
Definitely inspired me with this one.
---
Hmm yeah it cut off on the photo but I do have 130 some gems to spend (not bought, btw) and I do want to spend them on brawlers I don’t have skins for as suppose to having two skins for Jessie. Also there are like 3 other brock skins sooo
---
Thank you!! It would fit perfectly because he can remove his head (Headless horseman)
---
Left thumb finger has changed. Are you stupid?
---
I got 75 gems and i have twicing tokens (over 700 ) and now i m gonna buy them
---
Very good offer
---
Lmao I have 9600 and no legendaries
---
k
---
Yes
---
I'm proud of this community.
---
It should be the music for 4th through 7th in the solo modes
---
CZ :D
---
*Frinks*
---
Man !!! We need to make this possible…Everyone have this idea but supercell is not adding this (not saying supercell don’t listen to us or I hate supercell) if you post this type of ideas again again we will might get them in game
---
After what you've said i still dont think she's op
---
Gene plus Shelly can work
---
Both charge super, gene pulls, Shelly supers
---
r/killthecameraman
---
its a funny, dummy
---
Yeah bit it's annoying watching all these kids demanding things like updates every month or even less. Or free stuff. It's really frustrating because they have no idea about anything.
---
Well, if it’s with your partner, maybe...
---
You are also trash for spinning
---
I'm not toxic "LOL" I'm saying what the truth is. You get shit ton of karma just for things like this
---
Of course you'd say that, you are a 12 year old playing fortnite and you can't deny that.
---
This isn't funny
---
Legit cannot get Crow or Spike. It's been over 200 boxes.
---
Be grateful we actually GOT an update with changes to things like people like you who bitch about every little detail. So downvote my comments all you want, it won't make you any less of a rude, spoiled brat.
---
He's a Robot he doesn't even have a Dick

It still isn't funny

where do you think these bats hide? Its their home

I'm not into trains tbh. Cool idea though.

You just copied this from Clash Royale

Ah yes, I see you are unlucky as well

Thnx

Happy cake day 🎂🤲🗿
---
We think the same you and I. I can see you have a great mind.
---
Not if you want to save gems. Since Halloween is coming, its possible we will be seeing new skins, so it may be best to conserve gems. Up to you
---
as a little mermaid fan,i can only say four words : take my fucking upvote
---
COLT
---
duh
---
Very good idea!

* kairoses finger snapping *

Wow \*^\* Nice art!

*weird kskldld kairos noises*
---
Are you saying you don't like the mixing brawlers posts for the 1000th time?
---
I like it,but those walls combined with the minecart rails will be the bane of my existence.
---
Ok baby , go buy yourself spiky slippers and diapers
---
*weird kskldld kairos noises *

amazing

Carl's should take a break, he's looking a little stressed...

I’m in the “Have all brawlers except for legendarys club”

I started getting box's like this a few weeks ago.
---
It’s not that hard to scroll through for a few seconds
---
and i got leon a three days ago,been playing since march but made my account at global launch
---
I really like the little detail on the lower left xD
---
But like madalin from romania find brawler harder
---
Wtf is that?
---
Yeah. I mean 29 is really low for a searching system
---
You have a 💯 correct ponit
---
Are you seriously asking that question
---
Use Shelly super 5 times...
---
That's the easiest thing I've ever seen
---
The score will show the number of stars of the person in the lead. 
---
If you are in the lead it will show the number of stars of the person with the second most stars.
---
Nederland of België
---
Cara is definitely superior **C R I N G E**
---
Shelly, bull, and 8-Bit have never seen such bullshit before...
---
I agree but I feel like it should be a shelly skin. She’s the starting brawler so it makes sense in a way. Also this should be a thing all along the trophy road
---
I want this !
---
Supercell, take notes.
---
I bought Jessie for 80 gems and the next day she was in shop for 39 gems.
---
Please don't mind the bad edit
---
10/10 comedy - no actually that we a good one
---
When I use him, most people just don't know how to fight him.  But the one's that do, destroy him repeatedly.  I have to change up my tactic on the regular, when in a match against those who know what they're doing. (Level 9 500 trophy Sandy, 14500 total trophies)
---
My bad

After ricochet was lost in action and got replaced by Rico, he was found dismantled in a bush, later he was rebuilt, but at the cost of having a battery attached to his chest and his signature weapon destroyed.

SUSPECTS:

Shelly

Rosa
---
Tbh if there's 1 map I will never miss is island invasion, and yet it got brought back, like tf supercell
---
Just like the normal green hoodie skin but no hood and you can see his face
---
Brawl stars is an american game...
---
Ohhhh gotcha...this will be interesting to see hahaa
---
they should increase the drop chance by your expierence, thats the only thing expierence would be useful to.
---
Woo such awesome map for real, almost every map has the same stuff but this isn't the same. Actually u could be the 2nd map in the game with trails so good luck ;D

I beg to differ.

Como obtengo los emojis

Better add one rn.
---
Yeah thanks for your awesome posts
---
Who jumps like that? middle school art right here
---
This is l iterally me when i play any brock after an hour with darryl
---
How does this relate to BS
---
"exclusive"
---
No prob, just thinking about what kind of responses this will get once it's done XD
---
Yes it is.
---
No I haven't... I'll have to check that out!
---
r/Im14andthisiswoooosh
---
Yeah no shit sherlock. Sandy and Leon I get it. Just because he has this two names doesn't mean it has to be on this sub.
---
I have 13k and all my brawlers with 20 rank or more without any legendary, sad...
---
there should be nothing inside and he shall pay for it
---
Nice, let me know what you think :)
---
Yo those legs are HUGE tho
---
Then it’s not r/lostredditors now, is it?
---
I've seen it once before and a lot of people like it
---
The memes are not
---
But when you click on the info bubble it says "he"
---
Bruh your friend’s shelly could’ve been rank 25 rip
---
Play solo.
---
I don’t get it either
---
Definatley that is the pattern it was Leon then gene then Carl then Rosa then bibi I see no reason why they won't change the pattern
---
It's r/lostredditors for me because it's not BS related. Just because he has these two names you can find anywhere doesn't mean it has to be here.
---
I remember pushing primo to 500 in this map        2 years ago
---
Reminds me of a my hero academia character whose name I don't remember
---
Don't worry I helped him push higher with Shelly 
---
I tilted 50 trophies on my Frank but I helped him
---
Good good
---
They're just plain old 2 euro coins. Had to google dinars, they look pretty much the same.
---
I’m officially unsubscribing from this subreddit, these memes are hot ass
---
Ah, I see. That makes sense.
---
I mean good that u gained trophies with him not your frank tilt
---
For the third thing supercell cant help you.
---
Yeah I've very upset that he tilted was literally 1 win away from #3 local US
---
:v
---
Really great idea tbh
---
Thank you 😊
---
The wine bottle is the starting point of my idea of a "French Barley" 😉
---
This is adorable!
---
What's with the black-out at 0:12 though?
---
thank you :)
---
Ok
---
Stop being a hater people will do what they want so please stop and I’m not saying it’s bad to speak up but please stop being mean to these people and let them enjoy whatever I hope you will take this advice thank you
---
Thanks!
---
Yes but I feel like it should be a good Shelly skin and she shoots the brawl stars logo
---
Very good.
---
Wow, it took me a few seconds to realize this wasn't a Nita fan art
---
no i made a sarcastic joke and you coudlnt get it and you are just being toxic
---
:/
---
Gj
---
The brawlers you listed are all epic or higher. 
---
25 boxes is not a lot, your chances of getting Spike from that are probably somewhere around 5%. Mythics not far behind that.
---
This is super adorable!
---
that is such a good idea! have my upvote :D
---
Just suspense lol 😂
---
Your rank is wrong.. Penny literally throws gold coin bags
---
You just got a free Upvote.
---
That doesn’t change the fact she’s a pirate
---
Um sorry I have spike I just grab him so I could play as him
---
The one that is supposed to be op doesn't have bad cropping at all
---
Showdown is probably the best trophies/time investment right now, so play that. 
---
Play Duo if you're lacking confidence, or if you're seeing a lot of teaming you don't want to participate in.
---
Try to push your brawlers evenly so your overall skill improves, and because pushing is easier at lower levels.
---
Otherwise maybe check out some tutorials for general gameplay tips.
---
Well it worked for that I guess, ha... I was a little worried Bruce had gone feral there.
---
Tbh ur not wrong
---
this is such an amazing idea, especially for f2p players!!! have my upvote so supercell can see this!!! :D
---
Sweet, great job!
---
Me two I have spike in my account no wonder I don’t have 3 of the legendary
---
same but with a mike in heist when the safe's on 10%
---
See you in hot!
---
Do you have any favorite GG maps or do you play them all?
---
I really like double swoosh and minecart madness but I don't find Crow works really well on all of them.
---
Is it probably because ive ran out of normal brawlers to get, so at this point of the game it gets harder to acquire new ones?
---
what do u mean by brawlers? bc that would make earning new brawlers too easy, right?
---
i love the 15k mark, its still challenging to get there and is a point where the road ends right now so its be a great new start
---
.....   ..... u/The_trash_artist
---
WTF IS HAPPENING HERE
---
Should we remove random option ? 
---
What's the point of random then ?
---
There's timing issues, that's why I can't play with friends mostly. Also it doesn't hurt to improve matchmaking doest it ?
---
Thank you for believing in my work 😁
