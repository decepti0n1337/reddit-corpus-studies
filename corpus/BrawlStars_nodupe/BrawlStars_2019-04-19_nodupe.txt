Yea if you buy tons of gems then contact support before charge back and don't spend the gems so they know you aren't just trying to minus gems

I like passive crows only plus I'm a really passive showdown player unless i just wanna team and ruin people's funüòà
---
I know I'm joking. I just make a joke with those guys that think if you destroys everyone with a brawler that brawler needs a nerf and when loses with a brawler that brawler needs a buff. Sorry, it wasn't so explicitly btw

Exactly (btw I m always using sort by newest)

You think my image was stupid? It was original, and I made it myself üòâ

I agree on not being able to shoot during respawn.

Whats "jizz"
---
Dude stfu, teaming is unfair and you are a carl after all.
---
I'll help you shop for them good photos
---
In that you are right, but a map will never be beneficial for all fighters, there will always be a map in which one fighter is better than another.
---

---
&amp;#x200B;

and how do you say that map I designed was made especially for the fighters you mentioned.

but afaik pulling her from a box will mess up your luck facor for legendaries and as someone with every brawler but them three, id rather spend 19 gems than ruin my luck factor

I'm always wondering what gives you these awesome ideas, looks amazing, I love the attention paid to the brawlers and the closeness to the originals instead of essentially remaking them... Love your art, keep em coming ^_^b
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be Mrs claus
---
Fair enough. But I did not have anything to do so.....Ye
---
Thanks again mate and well done on getting your Leon up.
---
Those are boxes containing coins and power points. If you get a brawler from a box, it is the only thing you get, no additional coins or power points. The exception is with big and mega boxes, where you can indeed get a brawlers in the middle and still get coins and power points because they count as opening 3 and 10 boxes at once, each with its own individual chance to drop stuff.
---
you just used the meme template boii
---
Thank you for understanding my situation, I ended in 2nd place by doing that.

And yes he tried to team.

No prob dude

I diagnose them with ‚Äúwhy are you flexing it‚Äôs a video game‚Äù

Huh, I play (most) every day yet still don't have a legendary character.....
---
^^^cries
---
I diagnose you with "someone has skills"
---
Nice!
---
this is hilarious xD
---
Any other brawler would be better at that than mortis. Definitely to get to first star
---
Why am I getting downvoted? The dude deleted his message, what evidence do you have to downvote me?

your name is spin4help so you can‚Äôt be saying shit

Taunting at the end, but he tried to team at first right after penny spun. That's why he stopped spinning for a bit after it became clear they weren't letting him in and then started again after the mushrooms started helping, this time to taunt.
---
That kid in a hoodie is still op af
---
How is is stolen? I legit made this
---
This is beautiful
---
he didn‚Äôt even die lmao
---
based on the title you‚Äôre implying that teaming is a problem whereas your name is literally ‚Äúspin4help‚Äù. spinning is how you team and therefore you aren‚Äôt helping the teaming problem.
---
Thanks dude for support

No

This is mind blowing indeed

---
See? PERFECTY BALANCED
---
Wow. Now I have to give both of you upvotes. Thanks a lot
---
Lol same
---
Is that so? I guess we‚Äôre ignoring the crow buff, the pam nerf, and the bo remodel as well. Yeah let‚Äôs complain about how supercell doesn‚Äôt listen although they gave us the three most asked things on reddit!
---
I agree with you. This type of people should always be ignored.
---
Looks nice bro
---
haha a few days ago i spotted something similar on default skin.
---
lmao good reference
---
She looks adorable. Very good skin
---
How old are you bruv yikes
---
I have two solutions that I use (as darryl, by the way):  
---
1) team before you get teamed on (bonus points if you have at least 5 more power cubes)  
---
2) roll and kill until there's no enemies for other enemies to team with
---
Lol it happens at those fun times I don't care losing trophies but don't get me wrong I ain't a teamer at heart only when I want fun
---
I‚Äôm talking about her super, that shoots bombs
---
I remember when I thought jessy would take forever to get
---
Heh, i hope all of us will see your ideas in the game!

Tara‚Äôs star power is good

I've seen one where a Rico stayed like this in the enemy side and keep bouncing shots off the wall.

About 25.

Jajajaja

I think he's just another attention seeking w##%@. This type of people disgust me.
---
Yes. They should have brawl tv for different game modes. I hate seeing showdown. It just teaches how to team
---
:)
---
Awesome
---
And if the opponent has a max frank matchmaking should also put a max frank on your team. Extreme disadvantage if they have a max frank and you don‚Äôt. Wtf lol??? You act like if they have a thrower and you don‚Äôt then you lose aka throwers are guaranteed wins. Then just play a thrower urself? If u dont face another thrower u win according to u ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Increase mortis range like before bcuz he is not op in brawl ball anymore.or maybe 5-7 %.Mortis had double range of current in og days.
---
I agree, even though Brawl Stars is amazing, Clash Royale is better. But I think we ALL can agree that SUPERCELL is the best in making games in general :)
---
Seriously. I was warming up to it and then someone pointed out that it was a cap and it just ruins the design imo. What was the thought behind that? They could‚Äôve just left the back solid white and it would‚Äôve been easier to model and made more sense

Finally someone who didn‚Äôt hype up his skins like hell. Tbh I like maybe two skins but if he post a trash as Jessie skin and people still say it looks better than maybe a shiba nita than this isn‚Äôt true it‚Äôs just hype.

Just a visual glitch.

Super should be he melts into an ice puddle and cant be killed but he gets a movement buff (simar to leons) but he can go through walls

nahh

It's a nice map but I would suggest to have some less walls more free space.

Turns out it came out the timer, just few minutes late, it‚Äôs 7 days
---
My legendary rate was 0.5 but now its 0.1?? The frick.

It's just a joke..

It would make the skin cost more though.

Oooo!  Comment a link to Kairos!

Good!

Wtf mine was 59 gems

Instead, Crow got a 7% damage buff
---
Really creative map!!
---
She sitting naked....next to the animals ass...
---
Yes.
---
I could type a long response but here‚Äôs a tldr.
---
I main both mortis and crow, and I‚Äôve played mortis way longer than crow. I know how he works and that the request for a 4th ammo slot is bad. *However*, the idea of a 4th ammo slot in which the current 1260x3 damage is split into 4 is balanced, but it‚Äôs a nerf. Trust me.
---
so tldr again; don‚Äôt bother trying.
---
Also, I hate the crow buff bandwagon. It‚Äôs the shittiest, lamest and dumbest thing ever. The crow buff also made crow too op. I don‚Äôt like it.
---
Only sakura spike super is small , normal spike is fine
---
Itz just a game ffs
---
Yah but you win 10, it's still twice as gem grab even if you win only 50% of the games
---
I banged the bot and took a screenshot...
---
It's nothing to boast about. I'm at 6.5 k and no mythics, legendaries (except spike )
---
I love this map, I want to try
---
I know, but whenever I win a game of Siege I start a new match and instantly get clapped and lose 8 trophies. So I basically only got 2 trophies in 10 minutes.
---
You're unlucky )
---
Pennys SP is a disgrace

In this map darryl is the best

The buttons are the CR ones

No i think not

No way they don't tweak her super for that mod

Lag issues cant be related with the phone model, but, anyways, my smartphone, samsung galaxy s7, is good enaugh (i guess lol). Maby lag problems depend on the region... although a lot of people report lag... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I want to say that, don't save too many boxes for her she's just a rare brawler.

#SO COME ON T-SERIES HUNGRY FOR SOME DRAMA?
---
Same thing for the other Jessie skin,that shoots fire
---
She looks happy, he didn't got any trophies
---
Np
---
It's so annoying like it's not like he's dominating anything becuase in showdown everyone has to team on you because your the scary legendary man
---
Probably in may
---
I'm still bit of a noob at the game and don't really know the team comps so these are really helpful. I'd love it if someone collected these all to one folder and shared it.

I stand by my statement

Does that mean you don't lose trophies when losingüòÅ
---
Great drawing.
---
I got Crow at 700 trophies without money on the game
---
No. Let it the way how he is now. People thinking he's OP are just salty af because they're not habituated to get killed by Crow. Seriously, he's perfectly balanced now, just like pretty much all the other brawlers tbh
---
No he doesn't. Every player deserves a fair chance at winning. No matter what brawler they play. No matter what strategy they use, no matter the map.
---
##**AND NO, teaming is NOT a strategy, it's an exploit**
---
Hes not alone nox ive seen another one next to him today
---
How is this ridiculous in any way.
---
It‚Äôs designed to be a bigger risk and reward than other game modes which makes it more intense. I think someone‚Äôs just salty üòÜ
---
It‚Äôs not the same when it‚Äôs final 2
---
The chest is the turret. When Penny deploys the cannon, she throws down the chest.
---
You shouldn't have to avoid a gamemode just because players are ruining it with teaming, it's Supercell's responsibility to fix it imo
---
Yeah I did actually
---
chill. the ingame message states that pulling brawlers affects the luck rate. i said as far as i know, maybe im wrong
---
But it is teaming when these 2 teamed up to kill the rest
---
Three power 10, 450+ players vs three Power 6-, 250- players. Not fair.

I don't think so, they probably will add limited skins in the future, but I think they will do 3 skins at a time, just like brawlidays and the lunar new year.

em firstly thats very rude of you to call me like that. judt because someone is new to the game and you trash talk to them like that? secondly, if the game lags im pretty certain thats your phone problem, im running the game fine. and finally my suggestion explicitly said ‚Äòas an inapp purchase‚Äô, if sc set the price somewhere like 10 bucks im sure that wpuld far outweigh the storage space replays take
---
Imo bunny penny is much cuter (just my opinion)
---
#HERE LET ME SERVE YOU BITCH LASAGNA
---
It‚Äôs not a server cost problem as much as it would be a problem for the servers and us. My phone battery drains fast enough while playing BS. SC was trying to implement replays for at least a year; they would have been reduced to drastic measures to take that option

NO.

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying

---
Well ya see, when people don‚Äôt team the modifiers are just RNGing someone free powers, so there has to be a balance between modifier showdown and regular showdown. If you prefer one or the other you can just wait until the one you want comes around.
---
If they don't no one would play the game full of teamers as the majority of player base plays sd.  It doesn't matter about uniqueness

Fair enough. I didn't have it in original design but I added it later on because without it, there would be no way to see messages sent by teammates off screen.   
---
Maybe making the message pop up at the middle of the screen would be better.   
---
Thanks for the feedback!

How bubbles / water hurts someone soo much?

That's the better question

i was thinking jessie like range with a nerf to her super, to make her a unique brawler-
---
Ehh, he doesn't really need a nerf

Play gem grab, poco is better at that anyway

Guess it's a new Brawler

Petition to buff Frank. More health, longer stun, more damage. If this post gets 1 upvote supercell must do this.
---
how exactly? Shelly can't even do damage with her super because of it's low range and it only does 4000 damage even at point blank. Rico's super does more damage, and has more range.

You just had to go and say it...

---
yeah, that's the one problem about the balance changes. I would say buffing darryl was a big mistake (he easily needed a nerf because he was the second best brawler) but since darryl is my favorite brawler it's even more free trophies for me.

Yes officer, this man right there

Yeah so save like 10 ta 20 or if u wanna get her to a higher level save more

You were addicted, as was I before. Your brain is a physical organ just like the rest of your body and reacts in physical ways to the addiction, don't fall for the "it's all mental" hype (which infers there's nothing physicial to thoughts and feelings).

Also, get rid of the TNT and put regular obstacles instead with narrower width. Although, TNT in brawl ball could be fun, it could knock you back and deal tons of damage to a ball carrier.
---
Yup
---
Lol this was before the buff
---
The game doesn't have any brawler for you in the pipline. Euther you get one or you don't. You could play for 8 years without getting a rare brawler. It's possible. It's not like in CR where you can see your chest cycle.

No one will die

So can anything...

Is the second one pronounced More-tee or More-tie?

Oh lol I didn‚Äôt want to say this cuz I feel bad for supercell but the only thing they needed to change for crow is his star power. It doesn‚Äôt rlly change much. They should‚Äôve changed it to smt like ‚ÄúWhen a brawler affected by his poison dies, he gains a % of his super‚Äù

You think 20 minutes of play time warrants a free skin? So many people want monthly brawlers, monthly updates, free skins, and probably average 10+ hours a week and refuse to drop a few bucks on a skin. Give me free stuff!

[How to Draw Bunny Penny | Brawl Stars](https://youtu.be/74HKSCz4_Pk)
---
Depends on whether or not you want to spend 59 gems or 80. I personally have both and bought Sakura Spike when it was 39 gems a couple of weeks ago. Now I bought bunny Penny today for 59 gems. Two skins worth 160, and I got them for 98.
---
That's a good idea
---
Maybe
---
Looks good! Also the bush in the bottom right has a skull in it! :)  Cool map dude
---
Its either that or your lack of skill
---
Unless you are a short range brawler like bull
---
Add a report button

It‚Äôs not the only but it‚Äôs the fastest. And because it‚Äôs a fucking mobile game I have barely anytime to play I did that.

I got Gold Medalist Ricochet before his remodel, so I only spend 30 gems. I was expecting the cost to become way higher when it became Loaded Rico.

I have that skin what you mean bro, you picking trouble? White Crow is better than normal Crow, and I'm not buying pheonix, cuz i want shiba nita.

If you move the big robot up there with them and hit all of them with her super it would probably be the max dps in the game
---
why are you posting this? It was in the patch notes.
---
Apparently majority of people in this sub are around 3k trying to auto aim a shelly with super at point blank range and then complaining about she being op on reddit. Thats the only explanation i can see for this amount of upvotes on this thread
---
I've got 400+ boxes saved for Rosa and I still do the same thing. End up spending an hour or two getting back to where I was because I wanted 1 star token.

teamers are shit, they have to rely on unfair gameplay

Bro thats not weird about this,its that Mortis is in a team with Dynamike

I think Jessie is about 13 to 15 years and I think that Shelly is around 25 to 30 years.

I have 7k trophies with only 19 brawlers. Quite unlikly i should have been this high in trophies

And you can‚Äôt deal with teamers because you don‚Äôt have skill, or you just don‚Äôt have the bravery or whatever it‚Äôs called to just accept the loss? In this case, you‚Äôd be willing to drop your morals just for some virtual trophies?

While I understand where you're coming from, allow me to point out a few things, Supercell has stated multiple times that teaming is a part of the strategy involved in Solo SD. Now, they are against excessive teaming (7-9 people spinning in mid) they aren't against what went down in your video you've posted. Where 2 or 3 weaker brawlers, band together to take on 1 brawler who has more power ups than the remaining brawlers combined. That being said, I am no advocate for teaming. Tbh, I dont even play Solo SD, and I rarely play Duos, when I do it's just for the Star Token. So I do understand where you are coming from, but at the same time, if you dont like it, and if the developers themselves have stated it's okay, maybe you should try a different game mode to push? Find a club to join, make some friends, and experience the rest of the game outside of Solos. 
---
P.s. you're using Shelly in one of the most open Showdown maps currently in the game, you should probably branch out a bit and expand your experience with other brawlers. When I started playing I mainly pushed in solos, but once I ran into excessive teaming repeatedly I made sure to adjust my gameplay and now I'm a 3v3 player only. I'm also currently at 12.2k total and level 116, if that info helps at all on your perspective of my opinion.
---
I'm gonna work in that more thank you
---
Doctor:Im gonna pinch you, this is gonna hurt
---
Doctor:Pinch
---
Patient:Ow
---
Doctor:So why are you here ?
---
Of course I want skins to be free, however that‚Äôs unrealistic. So is discounting a high demand product.
---
u understand
---
I hate teamers so much. Now if someone gives me a spin, I spin back... and then murder them. I think if enough people do this to where it becomes just as common... there will be enough of a risk to where it‚Äôs just not worth it to try to team because you may just get killed really early. So many stupid Mikes have died by trusting my spin... and I laugh every time.
---
Yh i do that when i have The chanse
---
That get to torture the teasers

Another excellent game of thrones episode.

Stop being so entitled. Ive seen and played games that have given absolute jackshit in terms of free stuff. And it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôve only given us ‚Äú2 free skins‚Äù. Count all the mega boxes and rewards in the trophy road except for the brawlers from it. Before global, we never had a trophy road. This road of rewards was free. Entirely. Not only that, they give out free items in the shop every day, not like people like you appreciate it and probably end up whining about how ‚Äúthe free reward is shit so I want it buffed so I get a legendary brawler everyday‚Äù. Oh, did I also mention that they bothered making gems free, since in the past THAT didn‚Äôt exist, they also bothered making skin discounts?
---
These are all free things that the Brawl Stars team chose to give us. They‚Äôre not obligated to give it to us. If they wanted to, they could make the whole game absolutely p2w. They can do whatever they want, it‚Äôs they‚Äôre own game. ‚ÄúExtremely greedy‚Äù? They also listen to the damn community. They make buffs like the stupid crow buff, which literally made crow op, and all the past metas have been from the community. If they were greedy, they‚Äôd have made things way harder for F2Ps. They aren‚Äôt greedy, they‚Äôre already nice enough to do all of these.
---
TLDR; you‚Äôre wrong and feel too entitled.
---
Gotta love perma stuns as boss

wait a minute....

The damage in a same attack just doesn't stack

Shut up bull main

So, leon?

Repost. I saw this ages ago.
---
After this he lost 300 trophies
---
Well its a knock knock joke so you have to start it
---
I dont technically agree.  The skin was added in Easter but I believe that the skin isnt 100% an Easter skin.  Most skins that come out with the respective holidays and occasions arent 100% about that one holiday or occasion.  Football Bull and Popcorn Rico are examples of this.
---
Bunny Penny is released within the time of Easter, and makes sense doing so, but if Supercell makes Bunny Penny absolutely about Easter, then after Easter the skin loses its charm.  Bunny Penny is supposed to be one of those skins that you can use in any occasion, and not just Easter.  Making Bunny Penny more Easter themed just loses its charm.
---
TL;DR: Making Bunny Penny is not 100% an Easter skin, and making it more "Eastery" loses the skin's charm.
---
what about frank supering half of them and then one shotting the rest
---
i cant do this because my frank does 1440 damage :(
---
More like to a 1000000% buff
---
You had to lose to get all the animations tho
---
Yeah
---
But that‚Äôs the reason you‚Äôre buying a skin, isn‚Äôt it?
---
How does that make any sense when using a super you have to build up doesn‚Äôt give the effect? Why should expendable ammo be better at that than a freaking super attack? Either your effects can‚Äôt touch immune players or they can, make up your mind super cell.
---
Oh and change penny‚Äôs star power lol
---
There‚Äôs different types of teamers but all of them have one thing in common they should go to 3v3s to play in a real team
---
I had like 31 gems and spent it on a big brawl box.Now I have one gem.(btw I got nothing from the big box).
---
Exactly!! Easy fixes to make too

that being said, great dodges, mate. you deserved #1 a lot more than them

when you only have legendaries left it‚Äôs worth it to get points, coins, and a change for legendaries. considering you‚Äôre only at 1000 you shouldn‚Äôt pay to get mythics since they are rare but not near impossible like legendaries

How much trophies did u get?

Nice but isn‚Äôt that bother team teaming

Mines rank 16 270 trophies

Thank you man. Yeah the hole teaming thing is tricky I don‚Äôt think it should be allowed but banning seems kinda extreme. I would just want everyone to realise they are destroying the only ‚ÄúSOLO‚Äù game mode

You can actually try her out right now!!

Life leech should be back in a different form

Leave modifiers as it is (spawning things)

Maybe like a new solo gamemode that swaps in 4th slot with tweaked life leech (u DON'T lose hp constantly but u never heal and only way to do so is by hitting ppl)

Progression is not the only goal in BS for some players. Being outstanding with skins make them enjoy the game more which I can understand :)

Noot good

Everyone knows this. Luckily, its not show as often as the old bunny penny bug, so your fine for now

They all had trash aim but good job ;)

Best way to teach teamers to stop spin is to spin with them then backstab

What mode is that?
---
no.

Hey, so, this may not help you and honestly it's a little crazy to me, but I think my issue was my phone case.
---
I've tested it a few times with the case on and off, and it seems pretty reliable.
---
Weird I can't get the issue to happen in the "Try" cave, which makes it a little more punishing to keep testing this.
---
I can't figure out how it could possibly make a difference, but I'm thinking maybe the little lip on the controller case that hangs slightly over the screen makes my thumb lift up slightly when I move to the left.
---
I have no idea but it's kind of disappointing since gaming on the bare phone cramps my hand up :(
---
Yes ik

Crow should be top, he‚Äôs not turning his back on the team, he‚Äôs turning his back on the user cause really you should win with crow.
