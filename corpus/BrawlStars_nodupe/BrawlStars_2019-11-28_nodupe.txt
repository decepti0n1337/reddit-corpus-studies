Thanks

You had 9 power ups soooo...
---
No one is special for playing since global
---
Solo showdown
---
You probably don't have experience playing with randoms. Once you play many games with randoms, you'll understand.
---
Because matchmaking is fucked, it goes off brawler trophies, not individual trophies
---
SOMEONE ACKNOWLEDGES VILLAINOUS FINALLY

Oof

I want a Morris shovel or crow's dark Mecha suit and daggers.

The ironic part is that the actress is named Piper Perri.

Ok I'm not gonna lie a knew this was gonna happen so that's why I was scared of posting this. Also, I like every brawler. No brawler is Bad, because they are all unique. If you think a brawler is bad it's probably because your bad at him. I like any brawler and I just thought these were reasonable.
---
this is cute lol
---
Oops sorry I didn’t realize that I posted it on the wrong sub. My mistake.

Stay away from brawlers and chip them a little bit at a time. You can charge in or use your super when they are chipped enough and you know you can kill them.
---
Hope that helps. And that Gold Mecha crow is sick!

Im sorry.use the app meme generator,its free and has no watermark.Also,try to use OG memes instead,you will get more orange arrows

This is interesting. Hi Omz!

Alright,that's fine,just asking cuz this looked so cool and wanted to see how others would turn out

i thought they do, but only slightly
---
Thanks! I use the software PaintTool SAI

That’s why I play tf2 and NOT CoD

I get what you saying but wait till you reach higher trophies, both on brawlers and overall account. Your skill level won't always compensate for your teammates lack of experience in the game. If you go against a 3 stack you are done for. The chances that the enemy team is worse is not a guarantee. The best way to push in this game is with a team of 3 that you invite and that's the point I'm trying to make. This is a mobile game, many of us don't have time to get into teams and make strategies. And that's why there is random matchmaking. A little tweak to it would help alot. Like for example, how about teammates that has either 2k lower and 1k higher trophies than yourself as random teammates. It won't effect the top 1% since they always play in teams of 3.
---
Shelly is 20th in win rate on snake prairie, bull is 21st, Jessie is 22nd....you have almost the same chance of winning with any of the 3
---
wow 7 power cubes vs 3
---
I love it
---
It could be playing with friends right?

What program did you use :0
---
Certainly. Poco is much more consistent at 3x3 than Nita. Music therapy is basically making your allies become immortal. The problem is Solo Showdown or Heist: in these cases Poco is useless. I'm trying to take Power Play into consideration, so...
---
Oh
---
Unpopular opinion but teaming with some brawlers is acceptable. Like, I get why a Leon or shelly shouldn't team, but poco? Or my power 1 mortis? Do you expect me to go on the offense when I can only burst for 2700 damage?
---
When the December update comes, I heard there were gonna be a FEW brawlers
---
Yes I am working on a animashen and slepy sandy is mostly in it almost done
---
No no... Nieźle, blondyna :P
---
U took a screenshot of a bald Rico
---
amazing this is
---
If there is an exclusive pioneer skin that is going to be released this year, it wouldn't have the same effect as Star Shelly later on because it would take a long span of time for the skin to become as rare as Star Shelly is now, simply because the surge of new players is greater than it is going to be next year (unless it gains a massive boost somehow).

It won't be super long before we get players with both golden skins. When it happens, the flex potential will be immeasurable.

It would be helpful is someone pointed out which ones need to be rebalanced. It I said not necessary, but it would be helpful.

But this year isn’t global release, a new skin would make no sense

It's new

I wouldn't play on this map as a lot of people tend to play assassins like Leon and more importantly Darryl which can easily steamroll you in the earlygame if you aren't careful, but you do outrange Darryl's roll so you can deal with him provided you aren't at a decent sized cube disadvantage and for Leon just always have super ready and you can usually escape or in cases kill Leon's that sneak up on you. Other than that skirmish around and find brawlers you can easily keep DoT on to get super and NEVER go for a kill unless it is 100% impossible to not get it unless it's for a better rank because you are facing certain death. 
---
Also teaming is viable option but I really only think you should 800+ where people know the massive benefits and would prefer to stay loyal for protection and therefore are less likely to betray earlygame.
---
Do some with jojo bizzare adventures style

If you think about it, both would've won the fight

feelsbadman. I also have 7 brawlers sitting on power 9 with both star powers missing. And I got them leveled up a month ago.. Not even one star power!

But it costs money. And money don't grow on trees, leafs do. And spending money on a game for a brawler?

Yeah the down one

7 brawlers? Holy crap i have 3 power 9 brawlers

okay

Right? So he saw gold mecha crow. Neat. It’s going to be relatively common at high trophy levels very soon to see gold mecha skins. I’ve had my gold mecha crow for about a month now. He’s fun.

For Mortis, he might need buff on super or reloading speed but nothing else. You can get super Shelly with Mortis when you have your super.

Frank-I agree and he will get some hp nurf then.

Hes pretty balanced and not that op, i personally find no trouble fighting with him, ofc there are maps where is less cover and bushes but then i just pick a sharpshooter, his biggest disadvantage is his speed making his easy to hit
---
Mortis' would be so broken, Bibi's, Leon's and Rico's seem kind of underwhelming, so there would definetely be some rebalancing, but these are great ideas. It's hard to come up with these.
