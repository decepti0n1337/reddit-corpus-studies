Look how they massacred my boi  😔  (Spike btw)

did you use star power glitch because for me it didnt work
---
Why they decrease piper’s damage instead of decrease ambush star power from 800=&gt;750

Thanks for the reply. As far as the numbers go, they are vast estimates and I did address it in the post. I'm not sure what perspective allows you to say they are irrelevant, as I think they are hugely relevant to put things into perspective, *especially* for people who have never considered what I'm talking about here. I think "don't play with randoms" is just a mute point. It's a nothing statement. There's no point in joining a club at this time, most clubs are inactive. I've been in a couple top USA clubs and I sent out invites left and right and am one of the most active people in chat and people hardly ever accept invites, nor do they send them. And god forbid you lose 2 matches "gtg cya bye" before you're even back in the lobby. 
---
As for your 2nd point, you are correct. But it sure does take the fun out of the game when you're forcing yourself to a small selection of brawlers. Basically never use any of the fun brawlers...

F for my friend that likes spike very much and put spike to 1000
---
That’s basically a copy of my post ... eh upvote
---
I generally think he needs a range, radius and damage nerf
---
You’re doing el primo’s work my boy
---
The unly way theese work is with star power glitches
---
No more brawl ball
---
Holy shit that’s 4 tickets!!!
---
so what are you pointing out? that in every match you got no throphys?
---
Mood tho
---
I can’t win lol
---
k cuz when i do it it dosent work and my wifi is as good as darryl rolling into water and stopping in the middle
---
So it still doesn't match the balls in his guts? Going through all the trouble to implement new colors, and it still doesn't match? Great idea.
---
😂😂

I really love this idea for it it would make the idea better since it will make it a lot easier to distinguish your Rico from the enemies Rico I approve this idea to be great and it deserves more upvotes

There us probably another enemy

But you know that you are same random as they are to you, to that 1-2 others players?

So why do you die in so dumb ways?

So that’s why bnets are bad
---
So are saying that if you are close to a box and there's a brawler, auto aim should hit the brawler. And you are just trying to get the box because there could be a Bull that can't even touch you?
---
Excuse me, that means??

I got Emz to 750+ trophies last week, but even then I still think she’s a little underpowered. Her Super is not that great, other than to slow down enemy brawlers who are chasing you, or get some more damage to finish them off. But it is slightly hard to utilize her super effectively. Yes, she can die easily. 
---
I think the star power you’re referring to as slightly broken is Bad Karma. But you can tell me if Hype is what you’re talking about, though I doubt it is a little OP.
---
Inevitable, this is my main concern of solo showdown power play. More frequent on high power point matches too :/

why in screen everyone is     china  name but expect el primo

they REALLY need to add a report button especially in power play. they should reward power play points for the inconvenience and give the teamers like a temp ban for like a day

Maybe Green and blue for mine

Red orange for enemy

Slight tint isn't enough distinction

This is lovely! Keep up the great work!

Too good
---
Hahaha...i have no ans. For this...
---
Can this kid stop spreading link? yes you use meme format, but the meme context is to complain about auto aim not targeting brawler. Of course the comment is going to be argument about using auto aim. Wake up kid, this is not a world of meme
---
Cute
---
Cos the fucking ‘joke’ makes no sense. I get what he’s trying to say but the meme format doesn’t fit it at all
---
Yay!
---
Indirect Robo Retreat buff :D
---
ITS A CELEBRATION, PARTY ALL DAY
---
Just stop auto aiming, people that grumble about auto aiming are just noobs

The problem is that the attacks are by default team-colored. Hell, even for skins, they're allocated to their team's color.

The way Supercell has gone about nerfing Piper is bad for new players who have no way to max Piper any time soon. In fact, several balance changes have been like that recently.
---
For me personally, I’m not affected by a Piper nerf to her base stats instead of her star power - I play Piper with Ambush and she absolutely needed a nerf. I was barely affected by the nerf to Leon’s base stats - I just spent gold to get him from level 6 to max ASAP because I have maxed points on almost all brawlers and can just choose to do that every couple weeks. So on and so forth - my account is pretty far along and when Supercell makes a balance decision about base stats with the goal of nerfing power 10, it doesn’t matter to me.
---
Who it matters to is someone with a month-old account who just onlocked their first epic and suddenly that epic is going from a mediocre brawler to one of the worst in the game, and she has an OP star power thst will make her good again, but they’re nowhere near getting that star power.
---
How about us Pocos? Mostly neglected by Supercell, of the fifteen original brawlers we have BY FAR the least activity in change history. Eight changes, counting two Screeching Solo nerfs and three Da Capo buffs, tracing back to 2017.
---
I was out of ammo, so I auto-aimed my super into the El Primo for an easy kill

You have no idea how smart an idea that is. Leon struggles because he dies easily, and because his low health makes sure he's mediocre at close range. Say if we buffed his health from 3200 (4480) to 3400 (4720), that would make him get three-tapped significantly less often.
---
Hey, when the the jumpad is about to launch you place your turret and it will somewhat glitch
---
What about the time you got Leon?
---
I saw Piper in every sligtly open map. She was better than Brock in every way.
---
Can someone translate?
---
Yep
---
It varies depending on movement speed of course, but I think it’s about five tiles or so that Piper is guaranteed to land shots on a normal-speed brawler and like 7-8 tiles for 8-Bit. As for fast brawlers, it’s not worth autofiring on them almost ever.
---
Now THESE are the ONLY legendary brawlers we should care about.

Lol

Tara Super bug?
---
With her star power, yes.
---
Without it, no. I’d sooner play a level 9 Brock in solo than a level 9 Piper in solo, and I say that when Piper is my best brawler. Her base stats are not good, she just has one good star power and one extremely OP one.

You are the one without a brain

Not true. If so he would’ve gone into the storm. Besides, from my experience, people can be caught by surprise and have a reaction delay, which appears to have happened with this.
---
Frank could be replaced as darryl imo
---
this cant be real
---
He put up no resistance, if he wanted to he probably could have killed you really easily
---
what
---
Welp, now rush wars is getting shut down
---
Well see you in trend I think
---
How does it hide?
---
Newest supercell game, unfortunately also Supercell's newest scrapped game
---
Oh no it's all coming together
---
He could’ve killed me easily. But brawlers with a significant powercube advantage tend to get extremely cocky, and this often manifests in showing mercy to the other. I assume he was thinking that he was going to out-last me in the storm and hadn’t thought that I could attack.
---

Find a template (a trending template), add appropriate text that would suit the template and add context if needed

***teamers***

...And where are Pipers, the cancer of takedown? - Rank 7 and 10 as expected when you concentrate shooting other players instead of robot.
---
Actually, at high trophies is only bo's in the middle teaming
---
Gotcha, my bad then
---
Because if a bot wins you shouldn’t get trophies because you didn’t do that win and if people become bots on purpose they should lose trophies.

U mean no one knew that already :3

Btw i changed my username

And by the way, there is no support that we can contact for such problem!
---
It would be funny as hell to just stomp on her face until her brains start painting the walls
---
Welcome to the legendary team,nice art
---
Then everyone would use auto aim for everything.
---
I understand that Leon has been overnerfed, but Mortis still can't beat him. Mortis doesn't stand a chance. Mortis so far only has nerfs after the global launch. The only buffs he gets are to nullify the earlier nerfs. So technically he never got buffed. At least invisiheal got buffed. When Mortis reloads slower than a sniper, something is terribly wrong. People say he will be overpowered in bb, but how many Mortis can actually do OP trikshots. I'm not one of them. I'm pretty sure most of you can't do jack as Mortis in bb. There are only a few that can master this. Think for the greater good supercell.
---
The enemy Piper deals so much him damage no matter how close I am to her. Right next to Piper? Boom 1,300 damage.
---
It needed a nerf though.
---
Well, since it's everyone's least fav gamemode, then tru skillz will prevail.
---
Leon is OP and still is OP. don't cry.

If big brawler is dynamike he can get his super and use it on the top left or right and jump in. If the hunters cant destroy walls or not throwers. Then the dynamike will get the max time

shoulda given shelly a multishot crossbow smh
---
Just fking upgrade her
---
He needed the nerf imo
---
I like it! I do often find myself wishing I could tell the randoms that 😂
---
I feel this heavy. 18k but teams in power play, oof. At the goal I had a Crow on my team run it back and score on us.  WDYD
---
It’s not a single kill. In a 3v3 when you break a throwers wall they are crippled for the rest of the match.  If you ask me that not a waste of a super. Also they are times where you know will most likely fight a thrower just by looking at the map. So yes you can’t know for sure if you are going to fight a thrower but you can see if it’s likely you are going to fight a thrower. Your logic can also be applied to piper or really any other long range brawler. How many trophies do you have?
---
Because I pressed the auto aim and it hit the mortis
---
Man that Poco looks clean and Carl too very nice, howevere bull feels a bit weird. This is awesome, I like art in the comunity like this 6 out of 10.
---
BRUCEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
It still wouldn’t fix Piper.
---
Reverting both damage nerfs, then dropping Ambush to 650 would be good. Her base stats still wouldn’t be amazing or anything but a mid-tier with two high-tier star powers is better than a bottom-tier with a star power that takes her from bottom 10 to top 5.
---
*nice*
---
Omg
---
I just posted a remodel of this art. In better quality

It looks great. Though the colors shouldn't look to different. Because then if your stuck in the middle of a battle field and an ally Rico is shooting at an enemy Rico while your trying to fight another brawler you'll just be confused and distracted because of all the bright colors whooshing past you. Though I do hope Ricos shots get a Christmas colors type of update
---
Dude give up, he's braindead
---
Wait for the gold pass ;) SuperSell power activated.
---
i just realized that piper flair is outdated
---
That's a ridiculous argument. You roll in and get instant ammo back vs you roll in and don't have ammo then have to charge it over 5 seconds. That's a major nerf to rolling reload. Old rolling reload I did really well with through the style I played with him. It was an underrated starpower. 
---
Now there is no point in using anything but Steel Hoops. Big damage resistance buff last update and a health buff this update.
---
Yeah, you’ve got a point.
---
Well played bro, just about to post that
---
Thanks fam
---
This Is amazing JUST do it
---
How do you think the rework is infinitely more useful? Instant full ammo vs no ammo and having to wait for it to charge over 5 seconds? The point in  Darryl is that he can roll onto players with major damage. He can't do that anywhere near as easily when he has to wait to reload.

Please don't tell me your being serious. 😂

Thanks for the comment. I do admit it would be tricky but I'm not sure I see that scenario pop up too much. Anyway I just do wanna see this in the game somehow
---
OMG, if only there was another extra 5sec, just to see bull's reaction tho, sooo good x'DDDD
---
Daring today, aren’t we?
---
&gt;private servers that are getting better than the original game 
---
what kind of crack are you on, and more importantly can i have some
---
After the rework you just don't touch rolling reload. Before the rework I could have told you exactly the way to play which made it a better choice than Steel Hoops in Brawl Ball in particular.
---
I team in solo showdown

Is nice

Everyone hating on Leon even supercell

Oh shiiieeeeet, i think i found a genius that can make a better AI for the matchmaking in brawlstars :OOO
---
Sorry if I’m wrong, but it looks like the second 8 is photoshopped in... it looks a bit crooked. Sorry again if I’m incorrect and congrats on that payload!

So 9 mortises kill each other’s while dyn hides in bushes and win?

You should make ads for BS and be paid

I just saing its hard to ge him and new players get him
---
His default icon has got dark eyes.
---
Happy brawl day lad ┏(＾0＾)┛
---
Tbh the forth tile from goals need to have 2 sides instead of 1
---
Is this done in photoshop? I'd like to make ideas of my own without spending 20 bucks a month.
---
Coach cory:"yeaaa no rate"
---
now piper needs to be level 8 to have 2k damage for her main attack
---
Nope. Her reload is still the slowest in the game.
---
I used a drawing app on my iPad, ibisPaint X
---
Why I gave up: a 4 minute video that could have been summed up in 4 words

No shit what is this game about

thanks. Might try it out.

Just messing with u, but yeaaaa u got that right, the title should've been "trolling -500IQ leons" instead x'D

---
More hard -&gt; **harder**
---
Why do people post this shit? Who cares? My guess is the youtubers appreciate these “imposters” because it’s free advertising for the channel.
---
This is awesome. Need some epic or spooky sound together
---
I wish every skin was in the shop so you don't wait 5 days fore 1 to be in the shop
---
Thanks!
---
Oh yes let's everyone fuck up to this little mistake
---
No emz nerf. :'(
---
Her star power is too strong : moving power + slow down + poison !
---
Cool.I like spike.Very good
---
leaving at the end of this month
---
Yeah but it Lakers you and you mates move very fast to a position
---
The Morti tend to be agressive towards each other so that could have led to a massive Mortis war and between all of that shit there was a Dynamike.
---
Can't make *
---
Sorry.... But beggars never get anything!
---
Congrats , you're an even bigger tool than he is
---
Bro just get a new phone
---
When I was younger (I'm young yet, but older now), I seen Brawl Stars ads multiple times and I wondered "What the poopoo is this weird game?", but now, look at me. I didn't know the game first time I seen it, now I'm playing the same game everyday.
---
Yes..
---
Nice
---
Yw
---
You're the missed picaso's son. Keep your art.
---
*happy bull noises
---
This happens at me too, like something was attracting me or a great force was pushing me.
---
That's actually true
---
r/NobodyAsked
---
I think he's ok tho besides I got a legendary
---
I would give this 0/10 because most of the buffs are not the right ones for certain brawlers. Piper's is the perfect example, she is literally the worst brawler without her star power and completely overpowered with any of her star powers. Nerf ambush and snappy sniping, return her damage to normal. 
---
Frank is still going to be bad because he is vulnerable when he uses his own f\*ing attack. Maybe reduce delay for his attack or give him a star power where he is immune to knockbacks, pulls, and stuns. 
---
Bull was already mediocre before, now he is going to be obsolete with less than 7000 hp at max with that short range. He is not even that easy to play, you have to be wise with his super and both star powers. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Like I said, I would give it 0/10, but I have to love supercell for that curveball nerf. It was the most broken star power and covers too much area so you will always get hit if in spike's range. Maybe curveball will still be good but not as good as fertilize.

Barley: Am I a joke to you?

Any suggestions on skins' bullets color? Or skins have their own edit and keep the same? Just trying to explore your ideas :)

---
This is very nice, I personally think it fits best on spike, just my personal opinion the skin
---
I thought Loaded Rico might be interesting to look at but I don’t know what I could do other than recolour the gems
---
7.5/10, very nice work dude!!
---
Keep it up!
---
This is blessed
---
Nerf :(
---
Think things through next time. That would make matchmaking terrible
---
Looks awesome
---
Thanks :)
---
This is a stradegy so STOP 
---
COMPLAINING
---
It’s about credit, if someone takes something and gives credit to the person who took 5 or 10 minutes to make it then that would likely be fine
---
Except when you just take it with no recognition to the OP then that’s considered a dick move, especially if there’s a watermark and you cover or remove it
---
I am sorry I didn't knew it
---
agreed but i’ll be only a matter of time before he start stealing high effort posts
---
This thread changed quickly
---
Mortises gonn get rich by eating those mikes. :D
---
Shitpost... And it's not original
---
Much so.
---
can u explain
---
Yaaaas
---
I like the regular show memes lol
---
Bull I swear if you kill our sister
---
There's one on the competitive sub
---
10/10
---
No how am I supposed to complete my mission now
---
If there’s hundreds of stuff that cause lag, they couldn’t fix at least 1 in the time they had??? That’s Pathetic honestly.
---
I HAVE A question!
---
What's the long answer
---
how can i have for example \[Crow\] BlueBirding\_Real ???
---
When you survive NNN
---
cuz  you have gene
---
29 sec.
---
Again, the fact that he didn't give credit would be bad if the meme took somewhat of an effort to make, but the fact that I could go into Microsoft paint right now and make the same meme in 5 minutes makes it seem not as bad imo.
---
It's not against any rule to repost a meme. If it were monetizable context, it would be completely different, but since it's not, I don't see the issue.
---
The person who made the meme isn't affected in any negative way because of this
---
'' Me Cries  While in Bulgaria''
---
Then you can’t say no nerf or yes nerf at all dude...
---
this can take hours
---
Oh, you are right
---
If you’re on the phone, go to the brawl stars sub reddit main page and click the ... in the top right corner and then pick change use flair! Tell me if that helps!
---
That made my day haha or illustratet my life
---
Ok boomer
---
lol np
---
nice
---
Wtf that a bug?
---
Now lose some trophies onother brawlers to get that spike to 420
---
If he does then I would definitely agree that he needs to give credit, like for art or other things that take time to make or that you can make money out of. Since it's just a meme I don't see who he is harming though
---
I recently got Frank and Shelly to 500 and there’s so many games with them where you just can’t do anything because of how they’re made. If there’s no tank then Shelly is pretty ineffective since everyone will stay away from her. With Frank the best you get is a fast super recharge with is kinda nice but I would happily lose that for a range or attack speed buff because it’s just so hard to hit with him and when you do hit you take so much damage it’s not worth it. So yeah both need reworks and they need it soon
---
Middle eastern players now have servers
---
I thought Rico was with Piper
---
I completely agree. Shellys super: way too strong. Frank: just too easy of a target sometimes.
---
Oh sorry i didnt know that aomeone already made this
---
I feel like you messed up your tags here because you have a meme with the discussion tag
---
[everyone's reaction to this] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-1yzoiUIGGs)
---
This is a stradegy please stop complain
---
For me that offer was $15
---
It was confirmed that Nita and Leon are siblings and that Bo is not their father
---
I totally agree
---
Aw fuck. My man has no leon
---
Since u like information, here is another one: Not cityes, it is cities. When a word ends with letter 'y' you give it -ies and not -es. And also remove the 'y' letter first then add -ies.

Sad mortis noises

REPORT PUMBA
---
CRAP, ITS TIME TO GO
---
I know but this is original
---
U have a screenshot of unlocking sandy?
---
That was beta release tho, it was only available in Canada I think
---
 Hope you get Mortis or one of the legendaries. Wait...
---
supercell said they need to remodel her first
---
Kids at 1k and don’t have Leon: OmG nErF LeOn
---
are u a colt main
---
wait what?
---
 ***sadness noise***
---
You're not alone, few of my friends tried to do that
---
Thanks very much! :)
---
If yall want English lessons hit me up, born n bread here ;)
---
No problem bro! :)
---
can you not
---
If they leave after a losing streak then they are just poor sports and I wouldnt want them in my club anyway
---
Hey, what a coincidence, me too. Heheh, got it?
---
yeah i hope that first i get mortis than sandy, spike, leon and last crow
---
By give up do you mean you quit brawl? I have around same amount of trophies as u and have 1 legendary. Just gotta be patient. Hope u get one soon
---
A pro dynamike player who outsmarts Mortis sometimes.
---
As of now 15k but I haven't grinded in a while, trophy reset put me to 15k and just haven't invested time to grind, my highest was crow but have lost a few with him so hes lower now
---
Wait, you're right
---
How cute
---
**insert Spike's losing position here**
---
Why so many curse words xd
---
The Brawl Stars font is a 100% free font on dafont.com called "Nougat", if you'd like to reimagine your logo!
---
How about B.I.G, the robot T-rex,  as the takedown or boss fight robot
---
I remember pumba as the agar.io youtuber
---
They already have people going through games and banning people you self score adding a report button makes it so they have games and players to check to see if it was only an accident

Fair enough

---
El Primo is a character with a sad backstory.
---
He was born into a poor Mexican family. His dad was a construction worker with a alcohol problem, and his mom was a stay at home mom of two children, named Shelly and Primo.
---
The dad was the main moneymaker, but Primo’s parents had a divorce because he couldn’t stop abusing alcohol, or his family.
---
His mom ended up going into prostitution so she could feed the family. Shelly went to the army, and Primo went to fight at a shady underground fight club, called Brawl Stars. 
---
He slowly made his way up the ranks, first as El Primo, then as El Rey Primo, sending all the money he earned to his poor mother, and to her sister, who was still in the army. 
---
But it wasn’t enough. The money he gave to his mother supported her, but he had none left for himself, so he drowned his stress in alcohol, just like his father. 
---
He neglected his fame and ethics, and soon became a villain to the brawl stars base. He was called El Rudo, and showered with hate. He didn’t show it, but he cried to himself, for the situation he got himself in, and for his family. 
---
That is why, in the game, his attacks and super are like wrestling moves. El Fuego is a representation of the determination he once had, burning with a severe passion. Meteor rush is a representation of his alcoholism, and how he ran away from his problems. 
---
*This is not canon*
---
But that comment got 216 awards. I think it has to be worth it to get -600k votes right ?
---
Ha ha guys I don’t accept my lower trophy friends invite omg 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Why
---
Yes draw more of these
---
Why does your art look so shiny?! I love it!❤️
---
You clearly never used any nita star power
---
Because hyper bear actually sucks however it sounds badass
---
this guy do clicknate and still memes from a long time now sorry dude...
---
I also prefer Leon, but I don’t have him, so crow is my favorite
---
*dettaches head*
---
I think the most cursed thing is dynamike in this pic.
---
Check your facts
---
Nice! But what is the size of his super? And what range is his attack?
---
 Had to re-upload because I clipped it terribly the first time
---
I rate this a solid 10........
---
.............. out of 25. It's ok.
---
They might do this but it's not really the time to think about Christmas offers lol
---
sandy isnt related, the family is leon, nita is the older sister, and bo is the dad
---
I thought it was confirmed by Supercell he isn't.
---
I dont even know. One moment i had 5 powercubes and piper asked me out and i obviously accepted but then 5 minutes later as soon as brock had 8 more powercubes than me, she just hopped in the air towards brock and left me 4 of these weird ball shaped thingies and i picked one up and all of a sudden they blew up and broke my guitar. 
---
Do more
---
Love this idea!
---
Thank you!
---
I'm down for a full series of Canine BS
---
Bo is so badass
---
They cant do that. Plus. Its only 2500 tokens lol
---
i could splash down two boxes
---
Hey, your right but  my friend who was the shelly has a way better quality recording
---
I’ve been coining the term Brawl Channels for ages now in peoples requests for this feature on Reddit. Of course we’d love to see it come, and I’m sure it’ll come within a few updates.
---
I make your trophies in one solo match using da capo on poco
---
Same
---
Yeah I’m hoping for it too
---
So am i! Cant you see im like half the size of colt? Im even a bit smaller than penny!
---
But hey that dont mean im not big either ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
That joke is stupid.
---
They trusted you 
---
I did too. 
---
So why in the bloody hell does nita know you?!
---
Jojo Poco!

What in the heck

That’s awesome dude!
