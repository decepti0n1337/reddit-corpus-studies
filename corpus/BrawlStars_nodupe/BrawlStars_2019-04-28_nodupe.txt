Supercell: .\_.
---
Clash royale was the same thing lol that‚Äôs where this comes from. Supercell would release really op cards, wait until a ton of people bought them, and then nerf them right after. The only opposite I remember was when Supercell buffed elite barbarians to a point where they were op as hell, and then after a few updates later they decided to nerf them.
---
I just did that today with spike
---
When you say nerf crow out loud it sounds so weird and different with all the buff crows we've been hearing
---
Witch doctor crow would be an epic drawing if you can draw it

And rascal primo/bull

No
---
meanwhile i have crow and no mythics
---
How about reducing her shield from 80% to 60%  but
---
when rosa use her super it will move faster by 16% (from 2.5 tiles per second to 2.9 tiles per second) It will be a little bit similar to crow speed (3.1 tiles per second) and now it will be more easy to kill rosa with her super and also it will make Rosa more able to escape or to reach her enemies easily with her super
---
That's a good idea!
---
Find ‚Äúshelly‚Äù
---
Honestly, I‚Äôll give it to Supercell for making the modifiers more anti-team. However, the meteors are way too slow and will almost always get dodged. They need to make spawn faster on teamers
---
Oh. It‚Äôs a piper; but idk where shelly is
---
Yes I am. I still don't have Rosa. And f\*\*k me I spent all my gems goddamnit
---
I think you forgot a zero
---
Lol did u say you were the best player? Lmfao!!!
---
Yes i think ur right

Lmao never looked at it like that üòÇ lol

Wait how you know?
---
They should give Piper a school girl skin where instead of a parasel she has a pencil that shoots erasers and her super drops heavy folders that explode into papers
---
Go GOATS next time you thrower...
---
It was definitely a premised room
---
With longer range and a good starpower and super. Would it be more original to let her throw knifes? No. No it wouldn‚Äôt.
---
No I just jumped in with randoms

at my time, it's 96 now. seriously! XD

Very GOOD is a vignette of the Game, why not introduce it in the game?
---
Just realized the dynamike is ‚ÄúShelly‚Äù, but the effects of the bullet give it away as a piper
---
Sad asf
---
Yeah that‚Äôs pretty accurate.
---
But Lissa has a longer range, a op starpower and a decent super.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be better if she‚Äôd throw knifes.
---
imagine next year april fool they replace nita model with that
---
Oh okey, and yes thats shelly, but pretty old
---
I'm still gonna downvote this; no one's even laughing
---
Been playing since global (every day), have all epics and everything lower, no mythics or legendarys. My friends all have mythics and legendarys tho, and they‚Äôre all like 1000, 2000 trophies behind me. Also when I played clash Royale, I only got princess.
---
I feel you man, best of luck.

(Also f2p)

I‚Äôm getting her to 500 in fear that she‚Äôll be nerfed to smithereens come Monday morning.

Change damage reduction to 60%, gains ult charge at half speed while using it.

---
You are on a new level dawg
---
Use bushes and get cover behind the rock tiles like any shotgunner and even if ur out of range keep shooting at them to give pressure and get ur super. In showdown people wont fight u if u have ur super so use that, in gem grab just hide in bushes or take cover close to the middle and attack with your team or just go in their side and annoy them while your team mates take the gems.

Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.
---
Mmm, I think you're right, it's to big to be considered a cave.
---
Basically jz maintain distance from ur opponents and keep them poison. Piper and Pam(with super ) is kinda bad match up for crow in my opinion, so try avoid fighting with them. Dodging shot is so important since crow has really low Hp, however it shdnt be hard cuz crow have fast movement speed .
---
Even if you hit most of your gears Pam star power doesn‚Äôt heal even hp nearly as quickly as three shots which also do damage from Poco. She‚Äôs my favorite character but in this specific case Poco would do more

Holy Jesus this,is so niiiiiiiiiiiiice drawing!OMG see u in hotüî•
---
Ok usually I'd agree that Rosa is op but this video reminded be that so is Shelly so I'm actually ok with this
---
Same!
---
I know. I main her now cus she is overpowered af. I've used her in all gamemodes and she is decent or better in all of them.
---
but it makes her easier to get, making her so much more overpowered.
---
Thanks, that worked!
---
I completery missed the "chat support"  the first time i was reading support tips.
---
I really hope they nerf her soon, it's too much
---
She will remain there permanently for purchase.
---
Nerf Hammer would like a word
---
thank you
---
what if their were 3 rosas fighting
---
Right? That's what I mean. She can get up close no problem, and her speed let's her get too close, too fast.
---
I agree that Rosa should be nerfed but it really doesn't take the fun out of the game, it's the same with Jessie. Some Brawlers are just excellent on certain modes, you should just try to not really get close to her. Even if she needs a nerf, there's no need to be this upset over it, there's still plenty of things to enjoy about the game right now.
---
Oh sweetie

 I want to give credit to [u/KairosTime\_Gaming](https://www.reddit.com/user/KairosTime_Gaming) and the Brawl Stars Subreddit/Discord Channels for providing these ideas on how to nerf Rosa. Rosa is very OP in the meta right now through all game modes and she really needs a balanced nerf in the upcoming Balance Changes, or sooner!
---
Thanks u/ProgramerNerd4 for inspiring this idea
---
Why??
---
Shhhh
---
I'm not buying it this is another excuse to show how broken rosa is
---
Most infuriating brawler to play against. And when your team doesn't have Rosa it's almost an auto lose ( there's a slight chance their Rosa is bad )
---
^Happy Cake Day!
---
I‚Äôve stopped playing tbh
---
thats hot
---
The only other person would be bull
---
Some bias to piper ain't there.
---
Between his arm and rocket was grey but ITV was fixed
---
Ooo ok thx for tht information i really apreciate it
---
i agree, the fbi is coming soon tho, no need to worry
---
Primo and bull seem to be having a good time together eh.
---
**Royal Runway**. I think this map is very special, mainly because of the middle, as it allows a quite fun setting for 1v1s or 1v1v1s when the map gets small enough. Or it would allow so if there were no meteors as they desteoy the middle before the map gets small enough. So I think ot would be a good idea to remove meteors to have a nice 1v1 map.
---
For me it's gene lol, when I want to heal up, that puny little projectile always hit me when he million miles away
---
Sorry for taking so long but I made a comment with the reason
---
or Practice is my trick ;)
---
Personally I would put it at 70 b/c Darryl‚Äôs is 50. I like the idea of just mainly nerfing he super charge.
---
How are these all the same dude?!
---
Dunno, probably the star Power
---
Those big game battles which Rosa are which or take forever
---
Nope, i only agree that her super needs a big nerf. But i've had a lot of Rosas try to use their super in Brawl Ball to just walk the ball in,  most of the time we're able to take her down before she does [though.You](https://though.You) do need to have Tanks on your team to stop her.
---
Lol
---
If you were actually sorry you would delete the post. But since you aren't, have fun with the upvotes.
---
Share the idea
---
Rosa is op af and definitely needs to be nerfed.
---
Really good idea.. she should not be able to chase everyone.... She even sticks like a leech when she comes closer... Give her a slow speed and she will be less dominating. But actually, I had other plan...reduce her health by half. Because she is god mode when she gets her super, and she gets her super pretty easily. Soo,,,, with that, el primo will not be forgotten and rose will not 1v9 all in sd...
---
#STOP ROSA 9V1. KILL ROSA 1V9

The old background story says that Poco is a musician that got out-competed
---
Don't loose to her :)
---
I never noticed it...
---
Impossible. Perhaps the archives are incomplete
---
Damn, that'a terrific
---
Exactly. Slowing her down would be perfect

Well his star power helps

Already did :D

Any maps or play modes you recommend with him? That isn't brawl ball because that takes some practice

Same I pushed her from 0 to 505 today. Was going to hold off on her until I started getting wrecked by her is SD.

Nothing I'm getting any time soon, yeesh

Lmao

7, Genes healing combined with pipers bush concept
---
Nah. Only for rosa. Primo has a pretty ‚Äúagressive‚Äù super and this is basically a very small indirect buff to it
---
mind you shelly's super is actually really good, the star power helps her close the gap from far range brawlers, also, he super knocks back which makes he easily able to counter Frank and primo and any tank basically in brawl ball. Also a Darryl killing a Shelly at close range, that doesn't mean shelly's super is bad it just means the player was bad. Also I have no idea what that Frank argument was about, literally had no relation to the topic.
---
So is Darryl. The only problem now is really just Rosa.

---
Metapod used Harden
---
Ur forgetting the point that shelly's super has no range. She cant slow down brawlers if she cant reach them. Frank's super has as much range as Shelly's super, that's why I dragged it in to the argument. And no, I still killed the shelly as darryl even though she supered before my roll hit her in the face and she got bumped or stunned.

Is it just me or is the moon a pomegranate

How the fuck are you supposed to have a concept for a brawler without an explanation or drawing of it?
---
Cool :D
---
80% less damage
---
Supercell fans always have better ideas than Supercell itself.
---
Probably but what does it matter
---
I mean, without her super, she‚Äôs kinda dull to play and can arguably be underpowered. I feel like if you nerf her super too hard, she‚Äôs just not going to be fun to play with.
---
Holy

Me too haha

Wham bam here comes Jessie!

(In all honesty,good for a first try)

Would like to see you try and do better

Oof

But then the shockwave doesn't make sense

Thanksss! I used Jessie in a big game match awhile ago and lasted 7 mins (I think) ü§£ it‚Äôs bad

Okay they were all 100 or more above each player on my team your explanation still makes no sense?

honest question does it smell like feet in there?
---
Title it 'people can't aim'
---
I go against stunners all the time and come out on top. Pop the super, get the ball, throw it away, run up to stunner, wait it out and kill them/team kills them and scores.
---
- if the stunner is frank you can bait it easily/ make it go in the wrong direction, saving your team and getting the goal.
---
She really is *that* OP. 
---
It‚Äôs disgusting that Supercell released such a broken brawler even after testing it and saying it‚Äôs ok, scary even.
---
Leon was super broken on release too but he had clear cut counters, Rose‚Äôs long range ‚Äúcounters‚Äù don‚Äôt put up enough damage because of her stats and super.
---
lol you are so wrong according to bfshkbfjbHGVBZabDAVJBK:NB/na
---
She should die

---
Hoi bro
---
~~i team with the training cave bots~~

Oh yea, I remember being so frustrated when siege first came out
---
Omg what happened?
---
Seems like it most of the time not gonna lie.
---
I tried siege.
---
This would be the best showdown map of there weren't so many boxes, there are more than 8 at the middle
---
Yes... yes it was lol
---
Why isn‚Äôt your movement control locked lmao
---
Np, glad I could help
---
Yeah but it had a shitload it colts!
---
as a darryl main i think it was a pretty big buff. it changed the utility of it from "worse bull super" to "cool ambush super, like a more powerful but less frequent mortis attack." it basically changed him from a mediocre heavyweight to a good assassin
---
Damn this should be pinned
---
It's okay if you want to share content even with crediting but please, atleast ask first
---
also, you'll grow out of this angry phase soon. I wish you luck.
---
Every line is fucking stupid.
---
As u exactly
---
It's 100% accurate in my opinion.
---
You*
---
It is perfectly balanced, on your side the total trophies are 300 and on the other side the total is 324, and since match making is based on trophies and not levels, this is perfectly balanced.
---
Thanks and you have worst situation i am sitting on 6k only and you were on 10k WOAH!)`
---
With only One in the match with 400 you can see the replay and the brock has 400
---
Did they not test her at all or something??
---
Not sure if a good idea or not, but penny needs a star power re-work as soon as possible, Upgrading her to level 10 wasn‚Äôt easy at all and then to find her under-powered star power is really disappointing, I hope they take a break from making those skins for one update and please re-work her star power :(
---
Don‚Äôt play as much lol. But I got that yesterday too lol. Couple of addicts

Not really.Shelly can still counter her by just slowing her down and pushing her away.That super will run out eventually and then shelly can kill Rosa.......Simple.

I knew it!
---
Yep same. I‚Äôll be shelving her unless the nerf isn‚Äôt too hard. I agree that she‚Äôs great but at high level gameplay she‚Äôs even. 
---
Tips for those of you struggling against her. 
---
1.	Keep your distance and poke at her with pock shots. She‚Äôs weak that way. 
---
2.	she loves camping in bushes. With the star key it‚Äôs a 300 hp per second regen. 
---
3.	when she supers stay away and let it bleed out. Much like a Primo or Frank, you have to be cautious with her super. Don‚Äôt face to face it or you die. If your team has a Rosa vs Rosa heal her. 
---
Tips to getting to 500
---
Showdown with Gene right now is great. Rosa does well with Poco and Pam. Any healer helps her.
---
Best modes: Siege, Brawl Ball, Gem Grab and Showdown. 
---
Bounty works if there‚Äôs lots of foliage. Heist works sometimes but she does little damage to the safe.

Far too overdone visually. Gameplay wise i imagine it'd be fine. I'd say change the the fences to rocks or barrels and it'd be fine
---
How are you doing all these skins?
---
Nerf kids
---
I‚Äôm with you here. Shelly‚Äôs super isn‚Äôt broken, but as it can be used to turn matchups she can‚Äôt win without (so most matchups) people see it as strong. They think bull should win against Shelly, which usually is the case, unless Shelly has her super.

Yeah. FOR THAT ONE GAMEMODE.

People often like to blame others for their own shortcomings (including me), that's why every brawl stars player hates randoms, even though that doesn't make sense, because there will always be better and worse players, so how can the bad players blame the good players?

I'm just saying slowing her down is the wrong nerf decrease the damage reduction and hits to charge up the super speed is key

She doesn't hit too hard to be unfair and her super is reasonable, but her super charges too fast. She gets into a close quarters brawl and by the time her super ended it's already charged enough to launch again.
---
You took some of my name ideas. Thanks!!!
---
You posted it twice
---
You team XD how old are you? XD XD XD
---
Rosa: Hello Everyone
---
Every plant from the plants vs zombies franchise: Please don't punch me in the face.
---
Lol even Rosa is too OP for Rosa.
---
I‚Äôm create a new map
---
Have you even tried dude? Shelly easy chains ults on Rosa and while it takes 3 (which is ridiculous) you kill Rosa before she gets like 3 punches on you.
---
yo repost credit the original post
---
Their should be none because the shadow would be hitting the wall
---
I think she just needs a nerf. Badly.
---
r/uselessredcircle
---
Wonderful cross-over &lt;3
---
They‚Äôre not low effort I just suck at animating
---
Her category is Starting Brawler
---
I have never played rosa and I never will until she is nerfed. It‚Äôs kind of fucked up that your playing a broken character and ruining the fun of the game
---
way better than Gedi, his skins are so unoriginal
---
Fair and balanced? Supercell doesnt know what it means
---
That kid is a rare
---
*iTs NeRf oR nOtHiNg*
---
Learn how to animate = higher effort
---
It's very easy in Kinemaster
---
I love it!!!
---
Rosa dies in endgame lol
---
What about a Ninja Tara who throws shurikens
---
Not even technically right, he's just right. Granted, nobody asked him but still ..
---
No Leon would be a responsible father.
---
I stopped using Rosa the day she came out because everyone wanted to use her. Now I don't even get anywhere near her I just poke from afar because she too op for me and is breaking the game for close encounters. My opinion though.
---
The person was called Skrillee
---
***\*low skill cap gang***
---
Idk why but whenever I see a Tara skin with pointy things instead of cards it triggers an OCD of mine
---
It is a bug.Only visual.Doesn't effects the gameplay.
---
If you take Rosa to Brawl Ball or Seige. You get stuck at only 2 players joining the match for long time ( at least that's what happens with me)
---
Ugh
---
Ehhh WHAT the trophies?!!???
---
Why should all americans speak english?
---
Niggatara
---
*what*
---
This brings joy to my heart
---
you need to use peek shots with crow so autoaim doesn't always work. Plus his area of attack is kinda small so autoaiming can mess with that.
---
*spike*
---
I never use auto aim with frank I learned not to when facing a mortis. But yes all these brawlers auto aim about 95% of the time
---
Liczba pozosta≈Çych
---
Dude her range is deceptive af
---
she is my highest brawler
---
it was like 2/3 tile wasnt it
---
barely makes a difference for aiming
---
Nah, usually I die because of getting cornered or being chased when Mortis
---
Blackface tara
---
ellllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll primooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
Yesterday I was the big brawler (lvl8 pam) vs 3 Rosas. 
---
Once they had the shield , they just blocked ‚Äúall‚Äùmy dmg and I literally couldn‚Äôt kill any of them. I died at 1:16 Because they also block the bullets  and I couldn‚Äôt hit anybody else. 3 Big yellow immortal balls protecting the other 2 brawlers. One Rosa was lvl 10 and pam doesn‚Äôt have a high dps but that‚Äôs just ridiculous.
---
And then everyone clapped. 
---
The end
---
He is not talking about rocks.FAKE CARL!
---
Yes
---
Maybe u are just bad?
---
Wdym, Tara is weak as hell, her damage is extremely low, her super charges very slowly, she is frail, range is medium
---
She can't kill poco because of how low her damage is unless she is right next to him, the poco just charges his super,heals and then you die
---
Her super is really the only thing she has and that too can suck because of how slow the super is thrown out, often you will die before it even lands in clutch situations
---
thanks lol
---
Maybe u read 1v3 wrongly or just didnt see it
---
are Dizzi and Hellen official?
---
Losses don't detract from your win count. It's a gross figure, not net.
---
#LegendaryKid
---
Can we have him as a new legendary brawler in next update?
---
No he didn't,
---
You spelled 'disconnects' three different ways, and one of them was actually right.
---
Yeah all she has to do is get on top of him and she can easily Dodge hos shots. Frank's can't let that happen or they're screwed
---
this. id rather spend 19 gems than decrease my legendary odds that ive been building up since i started
---
I see, none of you know how to dodge to close the gap, you don't know how to play him so you think he's weak
---
Cool idea!
---
Facts. I‚Äôve been lucky and now I only have to unlock crow, so I‚Äôm not letting no Carl or Rosa decrease my odds
---
lmao, what a god
---
Wow I mist be actually trash then because for me it's hard. Maybe it because I'm playing with a bunch of other roads. Probably not tho
---
That's a lot of paper cuts
---
When I play rosa, I earn trophies 
---
When enemy plays rosa, I lose trophies
---
Rosa is affecting my trophies more than she should
---
So like this &gt;! I think I got it !&lt;
---
None of that changes the invalidity of his/her claims.
---
His damage and super are fine, I think he needs a quicker fire rate like maybe 2.3
---
Cos EA
---
She
---
Feels a bit like FMAB
---
How dare you, you defy rosa, rosa has scared even Supercell, thats why she can be nerfed.
---
That‚Äôs completely your fault. But don‚Äôt worry, things like that become easy to fix once you play for a little while longer
---
Well they can reduce damage 80% too so she will be only defensive brawler and not let her super charge until she has her super already activated..üòÄüòÄ
---
Bad bot
---
They even have oddly placed balls!!
---
holy shit 400 upvotes this is 10x more than ive ever gotten XD
---
That has nothing to do with Rosa or Supercell, you deserved it. A primo/shelly/bull/darryl could have done the same to you.
---
Unless she dies then gg
---
I like the idea of her becoming slower when using her shield but the star power idea is stupid. Star powers should be viable no matter who your playing with and shouldn‚Äôt limit team composition
---
Pl0x
---
Omg i bursted laughing when i saw this cuz its true
---
Maybe a few less bushes but otherwise I live this map
---
We need a colt nagato skin next
---
I'm going Wednesday, I'm from Spain so I don't think I'll have an brawl stars ad, but if I see one I'll shout need crow.
---
This is probably the best solution, make her move slower during ult and lower the damage reduction to maybe 70%.
---
9 punchs.3 attacks.
---
They do? .... I thought it was normal. :'(
---
Go ahead
---
Auto-aiming as crow is extremely useful as you can focus on other skilled parts like dodging attacks and running away from Rosas
---
*spins histerically*
---
Buff tara
---
*~~Says something non-Brawlstars related~~* Ok
---
Trying to attempt a record time run while enemy team have a bad team comp.
---
Imagine getting 8 Keys after running around for 4 minutes chasing a Rosa.
---
\#NerfRosa
---
Wat?
---
That's ironic
---
A man of culture indeed
---
I believe that's supposed to be sarcasm...
---
Why does the top right car say steins gate
---
It‚Äôs 35 thousand health if you use her super while at full health
---
That kid knows too well
---
how did he say that 2 mins ago but you say that 3 mins ago?
---
&gt;!thank you, I forgot it!&lt;
---
I'm not saying she should be kept same. She should get a nerf but 5k shield absorption would make her terrible.
---
Supercell tryna get more people to play their games.
---
Thanks üòòüòòüòò
---
Congrats u did 800 damage
---
Joke are supposed to be funny. It clearly wasn‚Äôt a joke.
---
But what if you don't have the super and she runs to you? Happened to me today. Big OOF
---
I don‚Äôt have Rosa sadly.
---
Same happened to me, but with Mortis.
---
So its on the house my friend.
---
I nevermind what are u thinki g about me meme but i created this about reality in brawl stars
---
I only bought her so it doesn‚Äôt decrease my drop rate chances of getting another brawler out of a box.
---
Pretty sure Support can refund your gems and remove the character when asking within a reasonable time limit
---
Wait... gene counters rosa :o
---
So ?
---
Since when can spike ride a bike?
---
Great, crow buff complains are now over, now people will stars complaining about mortis needing a buff üòí

True dat, but el primo would beat Batman 2

Dynamike and barley are heart counters, just keep your distance

There are seriously whole subreddits dedicated to every brawler.

Just type r/***(brawler)***gang

The only exceptions are r/thiccochet and r/bushgang
---
OMG MY FIRST MEME HAS 114 LIKES (I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT CALLED ‚¨Ü seem like this
---
Thank freaking god,I swear I will never forget her super's sound if it won't be fixed.
---
they say crow is OP now, when Supercell releases yet another counter to him.
---
Only because Mortis needs a buff and I can‚Äôt climb with him have I switched over to playing Poco. Hopefully only for now.
---
&gt;!r/nerfrosa!&lt;
---
Right he needs something like 4 ammo slots.
---
I hate with a passion. No hate to you tho and also dont ask why..
---
**MORTISES RISE**
---
I‚Äôm not quite sure.
---
God damn though, the movie was amazing. If you haven‚Äôt already seen it, you must. üëå
---
He is very good at killing everything except Primo, Rosa, Shelly, Bull, Pam and Darryl. Getting close isn't too much of a hassle as long as there's any walls/bushes, or you're good at dodging. Sure he loses big time to shotgunners and tanks, he wins big time to almost every other brawler
---
In brawl ball she op, and I guess the main thing with Tara is that her attack is decent on its own, but when paired with her super it‚Äôs awesome. Honestly her super is the best in the game, but her attack is so so. If they nerf the super a bit but buff her attack it would be epic.
---
Beta player
---
I understand that part of the issue is that her super charges way too fast and often. But part of it is that is just simply too strong. Its not fair to play a brawl ball match and have rosa just run the entire length of the field and score while you pummel constantly. Reducing the charge rate either way you proposed makes that less frequent, but its still gonna happen. And this brokenness is applicable to modes like heist, siege, and gem grab that are also objective based. Her shield needs to be tones down first and foremost. Its just too strong.
---
current meta requires at least one rosa per team for an even fight. if a team has an extra rosa, easy win. if a team has no rosa, easy loss.
---
She‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôm taking a break from brawl stars
---
That‚Äôs what I was guessing, its just crazy that lower levels seem to get more legendaries
---
No one is forcing you to play her
---
Oh yeah, I also forgot about the extra 2 Big boxes and another 20 brawl boxes
---
Flair checks out
---
It‚Äôs pathetic and leaves little incentive to actually push trophies.
---
Rip all the free karma.
---
I know how you feel
---
Just trying to do same
---
He had a stroke, nothing else
---
Bo used to be one of the legendarys back l then if I remember correctly
---
Thank you for contributing to this conversation
---
Yes please do tell
---
no ones forcing me but if a big chunck of the community think so then the devs shoukd do something sbout it smh
---
Me too, buddy, me too

use gene, thats what i do to counter her

You‚Äôre welcome my dude
---
Well not really, you have the Mega Boxes which has the highest chance to get a free Legendary in the game I guess but you will most likely find yourself with nothing or a Brawler besides a Legendary

i'd make like 100 accounts and give my main all of the ones i get.

Just so you know only mythics and legendaries decrease your legendary chances. And if you buy them from the shop they still decrease your chances.

---

Yeah I definitely agree that she needs a nerf asap

Bo was epic not a legendary

Thank you it's been a while the game has changed a lot since then from using elixers to individually upgrade super attack and health to what we have now
---
this is what rosa should look like [https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/bieshi/new\_rosa\_skin\_idea/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/bieshi/new_rosa_skin_idea/)
---
i feel like a nerf would be good since youll need to know brawler matchups so its not the same thing every match
---
So do you think Rosa is strong in ball even against teams with shelly or primo or gene that can easily take away the ballü§î
---
Every 1000 trophies... the game honestly just needs more content. It feels empty imo, but maybe that‚Äôs just me.
---
Thx :)
---
This is what rosa should look like until the update her [https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/bieshi/new\_rosa\_skin\_idea/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/bieshi/new_rosa_skin_idea/)
---
I know, I play since day one ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Thats the point. Game companies (mostly mobile ones) sometimes make new characters better to make people play them (and to also get money via gem purchases). Another example is btd6 where 2 new towers, monkey druid and alchemist, are just op (like every major strat uses alchemist). And the whole point of that was to just make them popular.
---
I dont know, i thing is a great name for a magic ninja shadow...
---
I had to remake my account because I lost the iOS beta one
---
Thats actually a good idea.
---
In which box did you get it? :D
---
and how did u had mortis on your name?
---
I'm with ya as well but just with the Trophy Road for me
---
I legit rofl and lmao
---
ive played for like 4 months and I have everyone exept spike ;/
---
who kicked it in?
---
I got her to 260 but it is hard with power 1 and the showdown stage that is on rn. But damn she OP
---
Decent start, but a bit bland in corners making the save look over decorated.
---
Up
---
I personally think Mortis is fine, but because of the dominance of Rosa, and the popularity of Nita, Bull, Carl, Pam And Leon all counters Mortis well, he just got hit real hard
---
Sorta like when people are craving for a Crow buff because people think he‚Äôs underwhelming, but it‚Äôs just due to the dominance of Pam, Spike as well as the rise of the tanks, which Crow is not good against. Now see? Crow is super powerful now, thanks to Pam‚Äôs nerf, and the buff, some changes made tanks fell a bit, which obviously helped Crow even more
---
I think Rosa and Pam need nerfs for sure, then we‚Äôll decide if Nita, Bull, Carl And Leon needs some small nerfs, if none of these are helping Mortis, we‚Äôll buff him
---
Fucking repost from like 3 days ago
---
Nerf rosa
---
Let fan art be fanart
---
So true
---
Trophies
---
I don't think her super should reduce damage, instead give her a shield with about 3000 hp that is upgraded with level ups/ cubes. It would disappear after  8 secs
---
You need to play brawl ball with her. I gained about 700 trophies since she came out üòÇ .. by playing Rosa and having her in my team..
---
She is very overpowered. She controls the meta like a puppet. If you don‚Äôt have a Rosa on your team, well then your screwed.
---
I gotchu
---
Idk Daniel is pretty strong in the meta rn
---
Yeah, I spent money but not on those brawlers but token doublers which only doubles the chances so I am very lucky.
---
In my case Got her on first chest on one account , still trying on the other during the whole weekend. She just won‚Äôt drop lol.
---
I want push my darryl
---
Nah fam, i think you say that it isn't fun bcs you never killed 3 people teaming in showdown at the same time with 2 elixir
---
Agreed
---
Dude at least do the &gt;!    !&lt; to hide the spoiler!
---
fair enough my guy, could i borrow some luck ahahah
---
why does this have strategy flair?
---
I know. Realised after. But still. Most of the people are under 10k and that's pretty easy to hit for me. So to help them to go in duo's with them shouldn't be bad. But I know what you meanüòâüòÇ
---
#1vs1 Rosa
---
no reason
---
Any fucking with time to kill kills the game. It's a completely different game now.
---
I mean, yes! Like I like having her and playing with her, but the fun of the game is lost when playing agaisnt her as it highly unfair and there's no competition. I hope the Developers do notice this and nerf her soon.
---
*less sadness noise because we are getting close to alot of up votes *
---
It's literally unplayable at this point. Can't believe how powerful she is: if you have one teammate who stays within her range, then the destroys your whole team
---
See my previous post
---
Well I know that but u can‚Äôt give a mii one eye
---
That's totally not noob! How many brawler do you have?
---
All her cards have awkward fingerholes in them lol
---
rosa with special beats primo with special tho
---
What if her super isn‚Äôt charged while she is using it???? That would be a good nerf
---
Yes!! I was the 420 st upvote
---
You know, somebody disliked this, I wonder why?
---
Oh damn. Well if your still not at 500 right now. For sure. Discord me: Derpy#8889
---
:))
---
When you don't get it so you write an essay explaining... how you didnt get it
---
Damn nice. What's ur total trophie?
---
Dummy boy
---
Thanks :)
---
She can survive 20 attacks with one super. That's almost seven full ammo clips. Unless she receives so few attacks that her ulti was a waste, she will 100% die every time from that. Might as well make her ulti "when you die keep playing for 6 seconds"
---
yep
---
Actually, to calculate the chance of you getting something, you take the odds of you not getting it (99%) to the power of how many trials you do. So, after 100 boxes, you have (0.99)^100 or a 36.6% chance of not getting it - so a 63.3% chance of getting it.
---
have you tried shooting her?
---
She's el primo, with a better el primo attack (cone instead of skillshot, literally noaim hero now), here ulti mitigates way more damage than el primos, she can attack during it, and she deals way more damage with her ulti than primo.
---
I feel like if Bull got weed he‚Äôd get so high he‚Äôll think spike is a blunt
---
Don‚Äôt smoke me please. I‚Äôm easily flammable.
---
Ok good I thought I was high or something
---
Actually, now you would have to learn how to dodge 2 types of bombs, I think this would be even worse
---
Ikr!
---
Do you like playing against her with a hero that's not her?
---
I made a reddit post with a picture of a club wars map i designed!
---
I love how his gun works!
---
Super is useless tho because you would have to know where the player is anyway.

---
Don‚Äôt fuck him, he‚Äôs underage. Plus he would probably like that though...
---
Sad but true bro
---
It's a good nerf, the damage resistance plus HP is what makes her strong, but only this nerf is not enough. They should also reduce the time of her Super or something similar.
---
What da club name!
---
nah done that but the remainder of the game isnt fun
---
&gt;!does this work?!&lt;
---
Lmao shelly doesnt hard counter rosa.
---
Honesly this is pretty underrated, you should post this again sometimes
---
#APOCARLYPSE
---
I like her being some unstoppable tank I think they should just make her alot slower when her shield is active
---
IF YOU ARE EASILY TRIGGERED THAN DONT CLICK THE GREY TEXT
---
&gt;! Mortis doesn‚Äôt need a buff in my opinion he is pretty balenced. Let‚Äôs not start the whole petition thing again please !&lt;
---
Sadly you cannot turn drawings into skins
---
Really good in showdown, and good against primos/rosas/ bulls as even if you knew there location previosly, you get a damage buff while they are camping there and the super is up! Maybe it could reveal enemy positons  to all allies? Thougth it was a bit op so i chose to just give him the vision.
---
Nice because I got all super rares and rares now I need all the rest except crow
---
Who were your other two teammates?
---
Oh i see now. Yeah I've unlocked star powers and brawlers from opening a single chest before. And that's after getting 100 boxes from the weekend events and getting absolutely nothing.
---
Nope. Rosa damage is a joke she has 1700 dps per second a t one . Frank has nearly 6K health at one. She would take at least 3 seconds and a bit more to kill him in equal level.

Where the fuck did the map go?

I had crow and for 419 gems it was an offer you can‚Äôt pass
---
Should be more accurate as well
---
Idk I am tying to figure out a way to put the full image
---
Considering that they are in Duo Showdown I dunno, they probably do team in solo showdown and then they get killed.
---
Lol like a Mad Max Carl
---
Beating the system, eh?
---
Lol I'm not complaining, those 500 trophies helped my trophy road a lot
---
Just random. Probably with a website that has a random name picker ya know
---
Yes yes I am
---
What if colt only uses ONE revolver? Hmmmmmmmmmm
---
That was the day everyone at my school was buying her and I just got home then opened one box then get that bitch
---
Mortis doesn‚Äôt need a buff a real mortis would understand that he requires something (not many people have) called skill to use
---
That shite is so op and break all the fun in this game!!!
---
Explanation
---
I did a pretty good clutch and when I was gonna replay and record BAM this appears to f*** my life which is annoying since even if the brawler is new and you got something. Ew you can't record because it's new and don't have enough trophies so I think it needs to be removed the minimum for the replays
---
What movie is this from
---
And the bad randoms click play again too
---
Probably make it so it leaves a crater(like brocks)
---
nah what should happen is whenever a bomb fires, her current starpower activates without destroying the mortar itself
---
Big LTE paid them to put wifi spikes in.
---
what's a buckshot?
---
Wtf I didn‚Äôt mean to post this
---
Reddit being retarded
---
Oh, duo showdown. Then I don't know.
---
Bro it‚Äôs not based on power level
---
Idiot
---
u/ryan_supercell u/frank_supercell don't worry we love u
---
Did you smoke crack at the time you created it?
---
Why can not there be a character as unbalanced as that.
---
To start:
---
‚Ä¢ She uses the super 5 to 6 consecutive times.
---
‚Ä¢ Super loads too fast.
---
‚Ä¢ It reduces an ABSURD amount of damage.
---
‚Ä¢ Six seconds of time. Really?
---
‚Ä¢ And worse than it carries the super while it is with the super already activated, which gives her an absurd advantage.
---
Seriously, it seems like you've created her lazily. I refuse to play with it.
---
In my opinion and some friends who play should make the following corrections:
---
‚Ä¢ As long as she has the super activated, she should not charge the next one, preventing her from using the super super consecutively.
---
‚Ä¢ Reduce the absorption of the shield to 60 to 70%.
---
‚Ä¢ Reduce from 5 to 4 or 4.2 the duration of the super.
---
Just a few remarks I made and should be corrected.
---
Thanks for listening.
---
And I‚Äôm not pay to win. Yea I have power ten, but I‚Äôm at 9k
---
But it‚Äôs a super cell, not an ordinary cell...
---
nah man, ram best grill
---
Op used a pre made meme for this 
---
He should've used meme TEMPLATE
