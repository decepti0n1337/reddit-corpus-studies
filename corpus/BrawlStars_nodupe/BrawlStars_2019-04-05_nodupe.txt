Randoms

---
Wow! Needs some improvements to overall look of course but I have always loved this concept especially with summer coming up.
---
What‚Äôs this??
---
this is how i got bo to rank 20 lol but after rank 20 it gets really hard 
---
ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èyup

Doesn‚Äôt matter I win. And you are equally as clingy. Whoever said clingy was a bad thing 
---
What‚Äôs ligmaü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î???

When children get Reddit.
---
everyone exept that one person who says "bo doesn't need a remodel" ^^
---
Mhm, but can you answer my previous message? I want to see you make art, i want to see your account
---
It was 5 hours instead of 10. Poor guy, saw your meme before. Not gonna upvote this one but will upvote ur comment
---
Yes maybe, but im not very confrontational so i cant think of many insults, let alone want to say them
---
Beautiful
---
The biggest thing I wish for the game would be to add a non-ranked mode 
---
What?
---
What happened to his hair
---
You can use pretty much anyone in showdown below 300. even poco is a beast at lvl 6+
---
These 3 spikes that are teaming is disgusting.
---
Everybody hates leon.... We rather kill leon than shelly
---

---
Just treat its shot like a mix of colt and bo attacks
---
One of my favorite! Fantastic job! 
---
Basically just toxic assassin, no change
---
I'm sorry but reposted...
---
(I had to say it)
---
But star power got nerf
---
Man U gotta teach us how sometime, we need these AI instead of those stupid randoms
---
He didn‚Äôt even kill me
---
Good job

This is awesome! The shading is amazing as well.

It was a name white people used to insult black people when segregation was a thing

More important that a Primo doesn‚Äôt use auto aim
---
They all look sick, especially scarecrow Mortis 
---
is it just me or do you also not have leon in your character list
---
Thus is the max brawler life..
---
Thank you
---
Exactly
---
When shooting boxes go right in the middle of them and spin around while auto-aiming. This will ensure that you hit as many spikes as possible on the box
---
Ca-caw
---
Sounds great üëç 
---
primo relys more on auto aim than crow, I guess its just whoever was closer to the boxes
---
No I have every brawler. Wish I could give my luck to other people because I got really lucky with brawlers.
---
Remake it as Patrick as the Bush itself
---
Gold.
---
Pretty much the same
---
Man these people really sucking his d1ck rn lol
---
The caption sound stupid
---
What? No as someone who got primo to 700 trophies I would only use auto aim if you are literally right on top of someone. Other than that always manual aim
---
They grow in the bushes for camouflage
---
I see 1 tile gaps, so no thanks. Good map idea though!
---
When I stun somebody, instead my super gets canceled by shelly.
---
Or the Leon's we're a fraction of your intelligence each
---
CA-Caw-caw-cawcawcawcawcawcawcawcaw
---
I have Two Skins Ideas: Street Artist Leon and Bride Shelly
---
as someone who is at 14.5k spamming auto aim is the best option... I honestly would only manual when someone is right on top of me as I can analyze their movement patterns and I would be less likely to hit in the wrong direction. Spamming aa regular super button mash is op just like shelly, once you charge your super you instantly jump with super human reaction
---
&amp;#x200B;

Speak for yourself, if you know how to use his pickaxe to hit through walls, he's actually better without his Star Power.

Actually that's impossible.
---

---
Wow.
---
That's ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.
---
Naaah
---
It,s bug it's only impressed because i'm not the star player
---
Relax... Sometimes it happens... Moreover... Also try to understand that this is a game, and shiuld be played as a game... Grinding is good. But when it takes over your will power, you should keep calm and give yourself time... And not only you, many other people try to push trophies and get tilted badly... One more thing... If you are playing solo showdown, consider yourself a hero... Because in that mode, you are the only one supporting yourself. No other teammate, just you... many great players don't play solo showdown, because it is very very tough to push from that mode... So, just have fun and try to learn from what others are doing and be cautious while pushing...

He hit puberty so we might not see it again.

The image quality makes me laugh even more.

Don't remind of my Boss Fight mistakes.
---
And yeah we get it ‚ÄòHeS n0t BuLl‚Äô like yeah great I never said he was. The problem is he‚Äôs not viable enough especially as a ‚Äòlegendary‚Äô brawler. 
---
Especially compared to brawlers like Pam, spike even rico. Crow just falls short in a lot of game modes and needs a buff ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è sad that it‚Äôs taking this long so I guess just expect buff crow posts until then 
---
That's a good idea
---
Colt Dislocated His Neck 2x Harmful Than Dynamike Been Bullied By 17 Mortises and They Died Currently.
---
Don‚Äôt mess with my Crew 
---
I remember my brother and i were fighting wonderbrad but we lose
---
Sure...
---
So that is what bull looks like without the bush.
---
Instead of feeling sad about losing trophies be glad you got this far at level 1, this game is going to be up and down most of the time. If you are tired and just want to push up feel free to level him up, nobody will judge you for it. 
---
P.S. We had hard rock mine not too long ago, arguably his best map.
---
Buff crow voice

It's Smash and Grab because we _grab_ gems and _smash_ ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) our enemies in the process.

Poco Has A Hat Shadow.

I respect yours as well and now that I'm thinking about it again, I probably think he's trash because he isn't good enough to be able to carry.

Technically, lighting yourself on fire doesn't insure death but it does decrease your lifespan.

I reach Tara lv 1 500 too
---
me : so the grass basically can walk now, and green grass is better than yellow grass.  
---
yellow grass : am I joke to you ?
---
That is true, it was clutch, no rocket would have hit if he died right away though :P
---
This is why I always stay wayyy away from solo showdown 
---
Xd
---
True! :) I was just wondering about it and wanted to know if anybody has the same thoughts - didn't want to tell op's mom how to raise her children.
---
Imagine the rule 34...
---
Yes, it does. It depends on the Brawler's range though
---
Great concept! Hope supercell sees this.
---
opponent team bull: THIS IS THE LAST GAME I PLAY WITH RANDOMS
---
I despise people that do this, teammate or not. 
---
I cannot blame you for saying that . But i am neither a noob nor a pro.
---
As in spinning?
---
We got em guys. NeRf CrOw
---
Hey can u send the link for i can mess with game files
---
People should also use common sense and not team in showdown and yeah that does not really work out
---
I say to myself that i will not play siege with randoms but i jump straight into gameplay with randoms. 
---
Should‚Äôve used the high res version to freshen it up
---
I still have them
---
THIS would be a awesome skin
---
Thanks!
---
Feel the same pain you do, my Leon dropped 100 trophies todays since everyone has the reaction of teaming agaist that 1 Leon that has no juice on the map, always end up in a 6v1 or some nightmare like that. The other modes are just stupid to play with Leon since hes not viable anymore for anything else than showdown. Teaming is just slowly killing the game
---
I can't understand why noobs which have star power still can't reach rank 18.
---
I instantly reached rank 20 after maxing my mortis.
---
Mortis bandit makes sense
---
Exactly. Lost 50 after being killed by a team of 3. Worst off where all 3 of the teamers has 12k+ trophies and I have 4.5k
---
No I‚Äôm not supporting this ‚Äúmeme‚Äù sorry

Yeah kinda but it doesn‚Äôt do extra damage on return

ive got 4,4k trophies but no legendarys. im jealous of everyone who got legendarys below me. welp at least i got carl!
---
I don't auto-aim lol ,i just use it for the super.
---
Why? It‚Äôs quite good for range brawlers
---
First mortis, now this.
---
did you gem to unlock brawlers really fast? i don‚Äôt doubt what ur saying, i just find it hard to believe, i‚Äôm at 12k as well, but i started getting more gold than i could spend probably around 10 or 11k

its fake

its humor that is a mega box

Then what do you do? Burn it? What else could you do wih the box
---
Yeah I agree, this map and feast famine are the only maps where close range brawlers have a shot at winning at higher trophies. There is actually a lot of viabale brawlers on this map, shelly, bull, maxed bo, rico, dyna, barley, primo mortis, darryl or leon.
---
Lmao
---
You better Bull-ive it!
---
But it's so true.... 
---
Thanks üôè
---
Sometimes people have all level 10/9s but don't have legendaries, so you open boxes to get star powers and new brawlers. Also gold that lets you buy star powers(and I believe there's going to be something new you can do with gold in the near future). 
---
Why not both?
---
Crow is top3 brawler in solo/duo showdown..
---
Good advice, will try this!
---
Thanks man! Will try this ofcourse!

Hmmm.... I post only her art? I POST A IDEA FOR LOADING SCREEN WITH ART, omg

Crow doesn‚Äôt need a buff, God dammit.

Nobody else can see your modified skins and if you change default skin to something all default skins get changed to that. It‚Äôs still useful though.

If the Bull gets his super, then yes.

Where did you base this off btw?

Tell me the truth. You didn't edit the video on your cell phone, did you?
---
Umm no? Tara is not dead

She is supposed to be a healer not a tank/highdps/long range brawler. My suggestion is nerf her Reload speed or atleast damage

I guess you did not take my comment seriously then. It does not matter to anyone else but me to what I post on reddit in this subreddit or other subreddit and I have nothing ashame to hide so long I'm happy with what I'm doing. If you are happy about posting random videos on reddit then it is your problem and no one should make you feel bad or guilty over it.
---
I'm open to criticism in whatever I post and I'm glad that other communities have been very helpful in every way possible. I don't find a need to attack anyone personally because there is much better things in life to do than to sit back on my chair and stalk a stranger's account but of course if that is what makes you happy feel free to do it. 
---
Pam is the new dynamike
---
Accurate.
---
I would never do those quests for 10 gold and 5 power points xD 
---
You would not be able to push trophies at higher trophies as you could get a bad brawler for the mode/map who is at high trophies. Also organizing a team would be almost useless
---
So basically no point except to be rude ok.
---
Both but first pam because shes been in multiple metas FOR TOO LONG
---
You mean in the lower ranks. Pams rule showdown at 600 or even at 500.
---
I'm not actually reading your comments by the way, I'm just replying with random crap, hope you're enjoying wasting your time :D! 
---
I think Leon be better. SUGGESTION
---
üòï
---
Glad to see you are learning how on to give less crap about what a stranger says about the content you post. You are learning really quick. I commend on your vast improvement over this 15 minutes. To me it is not time wasted if I manage to I corporate a life lesson to someone because what I impart to others may help them lead a better life than they are having now.
---
I'm glad to be of help to you and you are welcome. 
---
I'm pretty sure no one wants to join a friendly game, unless its a solo showdown match against 9 other friends
---
Darryl: it's free real estate
---
Its a prak, it puts brawlers no teams and ok the teaming is not a glitch but #stopthespin

Its over bull, I have my super.
---
Cool

OK, so here is how the Special Offer works. If you have unlocked all other brawlers except the legendaries, then the Legendary Offer will usually appear every Friday in your shop. Otherwise, you are gonna have to wait 4 the Legendary Offer 4 everyone (like the Crow 2 weeks ago, and the Spike yesterday). The new brawler offers on Fridays are by rarity. How many brawlers have you unlocked?
---
Could I get a TL;DR? I‚Äôm a little lost

Poorly made but good idea!

I have all except spike and Leon
---
i ever saw a post from someone with a 32 game streak but this is still pretty gud^^

Yea

Do Leon next

Really that's dont Is mine Iam only sharing an idea

My sister asked you to do the normal spike.

I love this! You made my day!

I find the game files more entertaining

Nita killed bear, and her super is spirit bear i think?

He is traumatised 
---
Did you mean...Brown Nita?
---
SwEEt SouND
---
:-D
---
He is very good if you know how to use him, he just requires a different playstyle (and aim) similar to how crow is a poke damage dealer. Still, I can agree he needs a buff.
---
Buff crow 
---
So what I did the same on release date
---
Yes, yes you are

I have beat tens of YouTubers. I think it's not something special

You made it because you're badass and amazing and need to create more stuff!

I think too many CR skins would also be annoying, this is a different game.

Ignore the middle part and just read the spin to win part. Brawl stars is spin to win because spinning indicates that you want to team

I. Love. This. Period.

I think any skin is better!ü§£ Anyway thanks!

So how is there n way you could share or den any info, just give me proof. You're making countless claims and you've given zero evidence for each one. And whenever I ask for evidence, you just try to avoid it.
---
That is only 10 regular boxes
---
Good job, it looks amazing NiTtTtTTTtttAAaaA
---
Im nUMbeR oNE!

Oh btw, add more walls on the outer edges and delete some of the spikes to not make it long range heaven lol. (more boxes surrounded by walls)

yes actually, I'd like to see it happen

My god, what have you done?

Nice also repost on r/BrawlStarsSkins for more credit

Ofc
---
I'd rather buff crow to take out a Pam
---
I'm a 6k trophy player I think I know each brawler's move speed. I also know that his speed is in line with every other tank in the game, such as Bull, Darryl, and Frank. So this meme is retarded for just putting Primo rather than all the tanks
---
i only have an offer for 600 doubler for 19 gems. worth buying?
---
win steak now

Have connections to all pieces of land so the springs are an option. Otherwise people can just sit there and wait for the poison to kill you or until you jump then they can spam shotgun kill you.

omg 150? thats so much, and so useful for "everyone" 
---
You are the first person I saw with negative karma. Congrats! 
---
Np

There are too many bushes I think. Not enough space in between bushes makes it very hard to flee other brawlers because you constantly have to check bushes or get ambushed.

Ye

Wearing wizard garb?

It is

Spike around 6k trophies
---
Hats off to you.

It's still telling me there's a new update ffs do you have Twitter or something so you can dm it me

It isn't considered teaming if they just do not spin to me. I do not need to actively spin to show my alliance. If you don't hit me I don't hit you it's just a passive playstyle. I don't need to actively fire shots to kill anyone to risk myself being a target. I go into solo showdown without teaming. If I walk up to a person and he spins to me but I don't spin back, but at the same time I do not hit him, it does not mean I'm teaming with him. I just decide to play passive. No doubt I believe that the pams will end up spinning and team but from that small snippet that OP showed there is insufficient evidence to prove that the 2 pams are teaming.
---
If a group of Mortis players travel together it isn't teaming as well. Teaming is an active playstyle whereby you and your 'partner' actively forge an alliance to collectively take out a brawler. In this case the Mortis that travel in groups with no intention to take out anyone is not considered teaming.
---
If A hits C and B hits C even though A and B are close, they are just taking out an opponent which they think is easier to take out. Only when A and B actively showcase signs of alliance such as 'spinning' or 'shooting at each other to charge super' that would be considered teaming. If A follows B around but decide not to shoot B, that is not a 100% chance he is teaming. He could just be hiding behind B waiting to backstab B when B encounters another brawler because B is walking in front. Get my point?
---
Teaming is hard to distinguish I understand. But people need to understand that just because someone dies frkm a 1v2 it does not always mean those 2 surviving brawlers are teaming. 
---
The double el primo super at the end was satisfying 
---
it's lwarb
---
Ikr
---
lwarb beta
---
Does Colt have nose and I don't know?
---
*Hewwo sushi drake!* It's your **1st Cakeday** thehaduj! ^(hug)

---
How can a single emoji get so mutch upvotes? 
---
Reality is often dissapointing
---
Why not ‚ÄúEl Primo‚Äôs Pizza and Wings‚Äù Pizza chain...
---
Can you open your dms plz
---
Dont ask for upvotes anymore. Go outside and enjoy life instead
---
So ur internet is bad so u don‚Äôt lose points but your teammates lose trophies????
---
This is really nice, great job!
---
How
---
Wouldn‚Äôt make as much sense. Because leons throwing stars look more like fidget spinners. And dyna spins around like a beyblade
---
For frank it should just be chromosomes 
---
You‚Äôll get Carl eventually...
---
Depends, you seem like you have more than enough coins so one would assume yes, but if you still have more brawlers to upgrade i recommend do those first. Star powers are pretty common from chests.
---
you need to tell me how to fricken get spread on your shots
---
and how to make more shots on a projectile because i cant seem to figure out how
---
Yes he have ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
o yeah so u can see something that u cant buy nice idea
---
The silence followed by the laugh makes this better. 
---
Because you are not good at spelling
---
I would like to se it in the game but brawlstars could get sued if they add it without permission and i dont know if marvel will let supercell use that skin
---
The icon is life leech if any global players are confused!
---
You‚Äôre so unlucky man, got all the legendaries at 6 trophies and I was f2p, I hope you get that last one soon
---
Very cool!
---
I love this
---
Yo have too many showdown kills
---
i never saw any offers or anything like that 
---
Depens on how many brawlers do you have
---
More you have you are luckier
---
Less you are you are better on the game
---
(Goods stats btw)
---
wow, it's so nice 
---
Y e s
---
5v5 would've been bearable but this is more like 5v1v1v1v2
---
Share that vodka with us. Soviet Brock will play some hard bass for us.
---
Are there apps where you can draw skin ideas ? I've been thinking of doing some but not sure if it's done by graphic design or just bust out my colored pencils and paper ?lol thx
---
If you have a Max brawler you shouldn't be sub 300. Never have I had a Max brawler sub 400. 
---
Fax tho 
---
Nice.
---
Hes OUR barley
---
What if I don‚Äôt happen to have an excel license?
---
Carl
---
Hello
---
I did not know. Ill keep this in info in a folder
---
How so 
---
Brock? 
---
I lost 50 on Jessie tonight, god I love randoms
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
Why is leon fidget spinner? I think carl is
---
Only 19
---
Good automod
---
I only have 19 missing all the mythic and Leon and crow 
---
You do realize passage is a sniper map right?
---
I won 4 times with darryl and many times with throwers on it
---
And mortis too
---
I get tickets when But I don't play many events
---
Removed. Rule 3. No providing information on how to break Supercell Terms of Service.
---
I don't think him without a hat really counts as a skin
---
Nice drawing.
---
happened to me a few days ago. but i managed to take a break for a full **24 HOURS!**
---
Before the release of gene one my Friends had Mortis and Tara but not primo
---
I like this more than I should
---
Turn her character sideways. Her phat ass sticks out an entire foot, at least. 
---
Hate to be the one to tell you that you‚Äôre drawing needs some color other than that it‚Äôs really good 
---
Nah, this is one of my favorite maps, control the mid, if they go around start attacking their safe back, and if a teammate dies they can easily defend the safe since mid should be controlled
---
It's beautiful
---
The only way to counter this is with a max dynamike with his jumps
---
The sword looks sick!
---
By far the best version 
---
Damn brother, props
---
Sounds good. I wouldn't change the damage but I would change the range of the bounces 
---
Pam goes 10 meters. also I couldnt test bc I dont have piper
---
I bought it too
---
Holy shit man this was 52 days ago
---
Everyone lags on this game
---
Leon sees his prey so he can beat that 10 power up bull
---
[I got you backed...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA7M_RIPHnE) 
---
Very amazing art, but I don't think I like the idea of a sharpshooting Frank, maybe change up the mechanics a bit, if you do that I think it'd be an great addition to the game, and Supercell might consider it. Very cool!!
---
Well of course Pam is 10 meters, she‚Äôs the size of the moon. Doesn‚Äôt mean the others aren‚Äôt as thicc as syrup. 
---
so is poco sans
---
It's more like a weak New York City accent
---
Omg I remember part 1 like a month ago. 
---
Totally my teams primo rip
---
Got any ideas for a rework? I may take it into consideration
---
Plot twist: Gene use his super to pull him back.
---
Hey man! I'd like to ask you if I could use your clip as a part of my compilation of Brawl Stars Highlights. I'm an editor for the Gaming Curios network. You would be credited with your name on the screen along with a link to this post. Let me know, thank you! :)
