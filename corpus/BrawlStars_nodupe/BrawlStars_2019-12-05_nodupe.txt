Jessie is going to have almost the same bullet speed as brocks or Penny's? I'ma commit endgame then.

But instead you see a beach ball

Buuuuff leeeon

Why the Golden tooth? Still looks good though.

I like this,it proves that showdown is the most hectic gamemode
---
Who doesn‚Äôt love Christmas balls?
---
:CC what were the chances
---
Wow
---
Sure i agree. My intention was definitely not to max my account this fast, it kind of just accidentally happened because i was expecting it to still take years(my experience of 4 years of clash royale where i used the same principle and am still not maxed). 
---

---
Usually it takes like 40 years to max an account for F2P players with SC games(with the economy they use at release, then they start making leveling easier when they start to lose players).
---
This is kind of reason for this post, i‚Äôm surprised and disappointed that i reached all these goals this fast and now i can‚Äôt help but think that i probably should not have bought those offers since i ended up fast forwarding lot of the fun stuff when my intention was just to skip some of the boring grind.

Jessie never dished out enough damage, can only solo throwers if barely. The 10% is not enough, she needs more damage per hit. Her attacks are one of the hardest to land in the game and for little reward at that
---
idk why you people think it's a repost,yes it has been done before and no it isn't a complete repost

No it‚Äôs real bug

Nope. This is a real bug.

I regret to inform you that a state in the United States of America has since allowed the phenomenon of relative marriage named 'incest'. That state, as everyone knows due to the immense amount of internet jokes, or 'memes', is called **Alabama**. This article is incredibly elongated in comparison to the 3-word phrase in which the US state of Alabama is referred to as a 'sweet home', which I - the writer of this comment replying to a comment with a spoiler tag replying to the pictured character trying to 'hit on' their sibling - do not know the accuracy of. The takeaway is: Alabama allows incest and therefore this vessel, the SS Leon x Nita, is only permitted to enter Alabama, with all other states prohibiting its entry.

i have lower powered brawlers with more trophies so that means i am more skilled than u

Almost done with the animation it will probably come out today or tomorrow
---
Lol
---
Well, as I said, I also have a mini with all brawlers at level 1. Im playing the weakest of the weak without a single power boost. I got Leon to 500 in two days at level 1. No star powers there. They help for sure  but aren't a requirement. I played him in SD, Gems, Bounty, and Heist. If you can use his mechanics to their full potential, he is very hard to beat.

F to the tick head

I don't see the point in buffing emz and Jessie?

"I'm stupid give me upvotes"

how did you make this? iam inspired
---
 \^Testing

I mean, they're random. You can't expect them to be good. We are also random to them. But yes, we can blame them for mistakes. Still, you can't complain about because, duh, you decide to play with random. Ain't their fault. We all make mistake
---
Sorry for making you feel bad man, I think I just might be the luckiest person alive though, so you're probably not alone.
---
Jessie is awful. She needed a buff big time. And Emz they just buffed her worthless second star power.
---
Poor pam :"(
---
Dat be sexy yo
---
\^LOL
---
Coiled*
---
I wish they would atleast making him roll faster because if you miss them by one tile you basically do no damage and get yourself killed
---
Pam is back to being the most op brawler
---
What app?
---
They Buffed his health and damage last update
---
No it doesn't. The RNG system literally ensures that it's possible for someone in the world to NEVER get a legendary a single time and someone in the world to get ALL THREE within their first 10 boxes. Those are extremes, but the amount of people who have played over a year every day and have no legendaries at like 14k trophies is absurd and unacceptable. At least CR lets you buy one of you save enough EARNED currency (not gems, which are also random).

Hope you understand , thats just a sketch ;)
---
Dude, I've played as power tens at trophy levels where if you match with anyone that isn't power ten, it's essentially an automatic loss. The only character I actually fear to go up against is emz. I've seen power 6 emz with over 800 trophies easily tearing their way through a full team of power tens. Yes, skill obviously goes into it, but if a character that is 3+ power levels below you and can still wreck your entire team isn't skill, it's an op/meta character.
---
I'll admit, the first 200-250 trophies were very easy  since I was power 4, going against my level and lower. But 500 trophies is a long time to play with characters and it is plenty of time to learn how to use them, and the fact that I can just go in there as a one day emz player and clean house is just op.
---
if they put out brawl talk on the 8th then they can release the update on thursday which is indeed the 12th
---
The next should be star power
---
Yea that would be cool!

Yea, brown always reminds me of kon and when he joins the Karakura-Raizer team, he gets a superhero outfit (but well he has always the body of ichigo when he is in the Karakura-Raizer team, not his own)

At 700+, they won't bunch up, and ppl will learn to dodge her shots which are really slow and she's just not good at competitive level
---
She's great in brawl ball at higher trophies. That's it.
---
Could be.
---
It's a REPOST!!
---
Aahh! We're Golden Wind!

Lol,since when is Jessie OP? I'm pretty damn sure that you don't know to dodge Jessie shots.

You don't have Sandy. That's why you want it to be nerfed.

But i am scarde because everyone dont have noses

The only lucky thing was that Frank played like a total idiot

Shelly was there at the start of the game... So unlucky for you

What a set of stereotypes. Not even funny
---
r/kidsarefuckingstupid
---
Get used to it
---
I agree with this, after 500 or 600 trophies everyone is teaming, you either join them, camp out or die, solo showdown becomes unplayable and you are forced into playing duo showdown with randoms if you want to keep playing "showdown". Awful absolutely awful, brawl stars needs to give like time outs for people caught teaming or some sort of a warning, or implement a system that notices when someone spins really fast...
---
Im at 830 trophies and you wont find a match without teamers, so i only play duo.
---

Rico will be op in this map (especially with 1st sp)
---
Lmao I actually bought it with the brawler, there was an offer to buy crow + meca crow skin for like 600 gems, and I bought it.
---
It‚Äôs a decent amount. I currently have 20 and 170. But I‚Äôve been stacking them because I have all 30 brawlers and all my brawlers are fully maxed
---
this is low effort af
---
It‚Äôs worth it
---
sandy one is so not cool. he shouldn't have that star power in the first place. location reveal and blocking all healing over a huge area with a super that's so easy to charge? this isn't fun  to face .
---
This hasn't been confirmed anywhere. You might be assuming too much tbh.
---
From Europe more exactly Norway. But now I seem the new from brawl star doesn't appear on my screen I can't se the new in game now :(
---
Happens to me all the time. But usually on most cases I select to leave the team, then go back in matchmaking, and they give me one of the same trash players that I played with the game before. Happens late at night the most.
---
Cool

Google isn't reliable most of the time for translating.

Please do"Jess will fix it" Next, plsssssss!!!

I know
---
It would be a long game for those Shellie‚Äôs. They wouldn‚Äôt be able to get near me. With the second star power they wouldn‚Äôt stand a chance. My average time with Jessie in big game is around 2:30, I would get 3 minutes for sure if I went against 5 Shellie‚Äôs.

Not when all you get is coins!

Well its been 7 months since my leon was low power level so i guess i cant correct you

You deserve it because you're that idiot who collect lots of power cubes and focus on attacking everyone else instead of the boss. People like you are why majority of the people hate Takedown.

I would then rather keep it like it is cuz i personally often use my turret to hit enemies around corners where regularly i wouldnt be able to hit them, they dont usually expect it.

Well, we'll probably find out soon.

That the game works 20% of the times in iran, because everytime I try to get in a game, the weak wifi signal icon shows up and the game freezes. I haven't played the game in 7 months because of it.
---
I tried doing that with Darryl and often it doesn‚Äôt work. Call me bad at the game as much as you want but sometimes you have to build power cubes to guarantee the top spot. You have to take time to collect power cubes as well.

Furthermore, I don‚Äôt ignore the boss whilst I play.

1. Being banned on one of my accounts for doing the right thing and speaking out. The reason is because I played two power play games in a row with randoms, both times with the same random who went afk both games. During the start of a match and then during the match. 
---
I joined their clan and in the clan chat without any use of name calling but was respectful I typed into the club chat the person's name and wrote please don't join groups if your going to go afk you did that two games in a row and I left the club.
---
Apparently this was considered disruptive behavior. No name calling, I tried to add the player as a friend  initially they didn't accept.  When I joined the club I also tried to invite them in a group to talk to them in private they rejected the invite many times.  In this example I don't think a ban was needed given the circumstances. However supercell does nothing to afk players and they encourage them indirectly by banning players who try to reach out to players in a peaceful manner.
---
2. Being teamed with mostly Spanish speaking players and I'm no where near a Spanish speaking country the problem is not they are Spanish speaking but I'm at 18k trophies and most of them are below 10k,afk a lot,have no clue how to play most 3v3 modes, I can carry them for the most part on duo's but 3v3 modes are tough to carry. When I add them as a friend to give them advice there is a huge language barrier. I am convinced that in the States there are not a lot of State players so they match me with these players instead. It's hard to push trophies with this obstacle.
---
3.Having coins but not being able to use them in the shop because star power's hardly appear and I'm missing over 50% of the star power's and most of my brawlers are at power 9 so can't progress. And when a star power does appear its the same one or two that keeps showing up it doesn't change much. 
---
4.Playing power play with a random we are winning ten gems to one 2 seconds to go and the random decides to run out front into the opponents, auto spams attack and ends up losing the gems and we lose. Happened more than once.
---
5.Being in a club that has a lot of members the chat is full of complaints hardly people want to team up and when you do manage to team up with club members and go on a win streak the first game you lose they quit and never want to play with each other again. This happened a few times at different top tier clubs. I'm at 18k trophies so it's easy to get into most high level clubs but the same thing happens so what really is the incentive of being in a club.

---
Dang. ... There should be a feature where players who are maxed out are able to share their coins or boxes to others who need them.
---
same dude
---
It's because random mortis always sucks, they don't know how to dribble properly and score. They ALWAYS fail no matter what. -_- And I hate it... especially at 550 trophies you see those no hat mortis, those are the worst. They keep taking the ball and just run straight into shellys
---
Why?
---
Nice bro
---
For what reason
---
Ngl lone star isn't that bad, it still kinda sucks but if you're going to talk about Takedown? Oh man that's not trash
---
That's the entire fucking garbage truck
---
December update has not come yet. And even if there is no christmas theme... I think it would be fine, because about half of the players (I think) don‚Äôt celebrate christmas
---
I do it from time to time me boi
---
Well thats no problem for me anyways
---
r/damnyougotme and r/stopwithr/ r/lol r/imgettingannoying
---
I can't stop it my mom secretly uses my schoolarship and uses it on clothes and clothes dont remain forever..
---
Thats Juicy
---
Stolen art,i have seen this before
---
You became the thing you swore to destroy
---
Oh wow, I thought It was just me!
---
Lose not loose
---
I made an oopsie
---
That‚Äôs not exactly a trick shot bro
---
vodka
---
It‚Äôs that second star power that sucks: eg invisiheal
---
Hey there!  
---
Sorry for the trouble! We've just released a fix for that. Could you download the new update and let me know if it fixed the issue?   
---
How I feel when I play Carl.

---
No big i in english lol
---
The meme is dead
---
Hahaha brawl stars is just money sucker from youtubers and 10 yo maggots who want to have legendaries but not opening boxes 
---
Cmon they created "the tiny update" with skins only to suck money from people
---
AND PEOPLE WILL SPEND EM!
---
I mean true I guess
---
Too much cuteness, my brain cant process
---
Yeah
---
Who saw ,,Joker"?
---
Jessie and nita should have special nerf for this gamemode
---
Yes you can that would be cool, thanks for asking firstüëçüèΩ
---
there is one problem the with the poco one, there is no limit so the speed could go up to 1000% and he's a heeler not a "speed buffer"
---
Brawlgasm
---
sure
---
Ofc u can, dont stress about it
---
Wow we made it into tweenkys vid
---
I kill enemies but i never lose
---
I came back after a long break and played takedown for the first time. At first i thought 'what is this chaos' and then i ran away from everyone focussing on the boss (while the others were just focussing on a 18 powercube rico). I got 2nd place.
---
Ok so Poco is a healer and support Brawler, he is nothing all by himself and solo Showdown is his worst game mode.
---
And gene has more damage than Poco but if he supers Brawlers, many Brawlers would be able to kill him as he doens't have that high damage or health
---
Yes you can use it
---
Sure I don't mind
---
Yep. He's nearly 10k health with his starpower, and it doesn't help because his super is so bloody slow.
---
Or compare the colts speed to your own speed
---
I like how he's got one his hand in his pocket all match while running. Looks neat.
---
Sure, but last time you said that you didn‚Äôt add my clip and you copy and paste the same message whenever asking to use someone‚Äôs clip.
---
Thanks, this fixed my news tab!
---
Wait better idea for leon star power
---
Invisaghost now leon can travel though walls with his super
---
I have that too
---
This is clearly stolen, I've seen this art before.
---
As i saw, there is no clickbait there.
---
*What did it cost you?*
---
*Everything*.
---
They can't do these skins, they would get striked by Nintendo
---
#Literally
---
Pam is perfect for a Santa Claus skin
---
Well, I'm a criminal
---
Hey i wanted to ask if I could use this for a thumbnail (Leon.exe).
---
I bought the spike offer yesterday
---
very cool drawing!
---
Ive never see a gedi kor skin i liked. I hate the cs but I‚Äôm pretty sure he blocked me or something because i haven‚Äôt seen him post in months
---
BULLDOZER!
---
i use a8 and i have nothing
---
I am same as you. You are not alon buddy

I don't know why you care about pointing about people with downvotes because they don't really mean anything but because you're acting like a dick I'm going to say:
---
Why the downvotes?
---
I mean it worked for me anyway. Just spend 5 months worth of saving gems on leon
---
And... This meme isn't about this...
---
It got lost because it‚Äôs dog shit.
---
r/engrish
---
The latest optional update fixes this. üëä
---
Ever heard of NOT spending coins on leveling up? You aren't forced to upgrade brawlers, you cant just focus on one. Also, there's a thing called the "Shop" in brawl stars. Power points for specific brawlers appear in there.
---
Petition to remodel the robots with a cool looking just as the brawlers :0
---
I thought it was obvious
---
The latest update addressed this issue. üëä
---
Why did you delete the coment
---
Dude just play it on new iPhone that you got
---

---
Thank you!
---
For the other people reading this he said he didnt know how to respond to the comment because he was new to reddit
---
√íw√ì
---
Did she pick up Colt‚Äôs gun?
---
Not surprised ur here
---
Post when you finish! Looks good !
---
Same thing happens to me. Just restart your phone and it goes back to normal. (At least for me)
---
r/woosh
---
Lmao, i have 10 brawlers cued for level up, dipshit. 
---
And if you think buying 4 power points a week is gonna make a dent in the huge amount you need, then you're a full on dumbass.
---
Happy cake day
---
Yeah but I didn‚Äôt use it almost at all I just started using it that‚Äôs y my 1st post was like 1 day ago 
---
So could u stop hating thx
---
Still a repost is a repost
---
CHAüÖ±Ô∏èOOOON otro post de calidad tuyo
---
Nah bruh they're owned by Tencent and if one thing is true in this world its that Tencents not short on money
---
Human souls
---
I remember when I used to play the game. It was tap to shoot/aim. Then they changed the controls and now I do not play :(
---

---

Please fix your audio
---
If you want to prove that you did show proof: some picture of the draft or its signature, because the one in the drawing was clearly placed over it.
---
That‚Äôs- that‚Äôs not how it works.
---
I don't see what's wrong... can you be more specific?
---
Ok
---

Okay

It just sounded a slight bit buggy at the beginning
---

---
That happened too
