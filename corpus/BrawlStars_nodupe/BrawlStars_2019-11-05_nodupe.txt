Still the best legendary and a really good brawler tho lmao

No.i meant that the bot was low health you poison it with crow then he jumps on a jump pad and dies  in mid air by the poison and you were in first place.

If your friend sends something to you, that means someone else made it. Since you know it wasn‚Äôt you who made it, you should
---

---
- find out who made it so you can credit them
---
- as a side effect of finding out who made it, notice they already put it on Reddit and thus don‚Äôt post it
---
Basically, don‚Äôt post memes you didn‚Äôt make on Reddit unless you‚Äôre certain it‚Äôs not on Reddit yet.

No one cares about this here, but r/lootstars is made for brawl box drops.

ok thanks for not getting angry if you want i got some ideas like you can try to go to the subreddit, look for a good trend, and try and make a joke, art etc. hope it helps and have a gud day UwU
---
Hi pro
---
It's a semi-Starshelly
---
i didn‚Äôt post this.
---
woops XD
---
r/StupidMistakes
---
Plus two months, but I guess it's the thought that counts.
---
*obligatory 15 k flex*
---
This reminds me of that meme where the one kid is running from the floating kid
---
I turned off my phone at the end of a gem grab match and I reopened it and it looked like this
---
Again, I DID ‚Äúadmit‚Äù that I used the art as a reference, multiple times in this conversation. But I also didn‚Äôt have the original artists information, therefore I couldn‚Äôt CREDIT THEM. I looked up ‚Äòbrawl stars Jessie art‚Äô on google
---
Images, found the meme template but the source was NOT from reddit, it was from a random half ass brawl stars art site that probably took hundreds of drawings.
---
In your first reply you accused me of re drawing the jessie art solely to get upvotes on reddit. 
---
Kid, UPVOTES DONT DO ANYTHING. What reason would I possibly have to want a reddit post of all things to get popular?? 
---
Let me make it simple. I re drew a jessie drawing that I found on GOOGLE with a link that did NOT go back to the original artist, therefore I had no means to know who I should be crediting. If you look at my channel (which I know you don‚Äôt have to or want to) but EVERY SINGLE TIME I show something that isn‚Äôt mine I credit it. So stop acting like me making a little mistake by not knowing who to credit means I‚Äôm an art thief. I‚Äôm not going to let some kid try to make me feel like a bad person when I know I didn‚Äôt have bad intentions. For real, you‚Äôre acting like you‚Äôre in a FBI investigation over a little drawing that got 200 upvotes over a month ago. 
---
If you‚Äôre seriously that upset about it then go cry to someone else, I don‚Äôt give a shit what you think because I know what actually happened. If you don‚Äôt watch my channel because of this interaction then that‚Äôs on you, I don‚Äôt care who does and doesn‚Äôt watch my channel, I spend hours on end every day to make the best content possible so if you want to judge it by accusing me of being an ‚Äúart thief‚Äù then go ahead. I‚Äôm not making drawings often, and I don‚Äôt plan on building a community about art. I don‚Äôt care, I drew something for fun and posted it on reddit, the LEAST possible place to get clout from. I didn‚Äôt even use the drawing for a thumbnail, I literally just posted it on reddit. Calm. Down. Kid. You have no real point in this argument, I didn‚Äôt STEAL art, I drew it for fun and had no source, apparently no matter how many times you read that sentence you won‚Äôt understand it. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I was more curious if it was a recent bug and exploit usable in general games. Thanks though. Glad to know it's isolated to custom.

As much as I would like to take credit, this a meme template someone shared

Dude, Karma worth nothing. No one can redeem or cash in money with it but I accept asking for upvote is not good.

Yeah but hey to ain‚Äôt trying to say ‚ÄúKarma is like a future currency and holy shit guys this can get you a lot cash bitches and fame‚Äù I am just saying if ya wanna try to get people to notice an idea, drawing, or whatever just let it come naturally and in time it will feel nice
---
Why TF people want to buy high amount of Internet High-Fives?
---
Imgflip.com in the corner
---
I agree
---
Thanks for agreeing
---
I think you should reread what you said, there was nothing about supporting artists other than letting them know their art is being stolen, and telling them they did a good job, and the people support you.
---
I was saying what happens is people will inevitably steal your work, it is simply too easy to steal, and too difficult to do anything about once its happened, I also gave legitimate advice that others in this thread also gave about what you can do to prevent it.
---
We were talking about two very different things.
---
And again, you are reading so deep into my words, I was never derogatory or calling him a dumbass, you are taking this far too personally.
---
See you in takedown shooting me instead of the bot
---
 Jessie is community and Pam is Supercell if you put it that way.
---
They have the same name, brawler, and they got in the sams team.
---
Most of the sub contains low effort/repetitive posts. Every time a new meme template comes out, they reuse all the complaints again. ‚Äú No legendary at 14k but 1k noobs do. Teaming is a strategy. Pam will never get a skin. Bring back OG brawler models‚Äù
---
Extra effective against Primo, Shelly, Rosa, and Sandy.
---
Golden Dragon Knight Jessie would look cool
---
Why would you do this to us
---
What?
---
The best match of my life
---
*smiles and remembers the pwr 1 rank 1 sandy that gave us the game*
---
So many of the models clip. Bibi‚Äôs a prime example.
---
What if u sign in to supercell I‚Äôd to get barley before u open the box? Would it change?
---
True
---
Wait... frank in heist?
---
Guys it was an buff to extra toxic, and it needed that buff because it wasn‚Äôt as good as carrion  crow which is balanced, not to mention a year ago crow was one of the the worst brawlers in the game. Crow as a character was balanced pre buff but extra toxic lacked in power . They are probably going to stop buffing crow as this was just to Ben out his star powers and he‚Äôs very balanced rn 
---
Crow main btw
---
Nope. In a way, I actually kind of like this. Lots of free space. This could also have the negative interpretation of too much negative space, so...
---
Mortis can't defeat El Primo in 1 vs 1
---
Woah they might actually add this, love the idea!
---
In other languages the days and hours are swapped
---

---
I'm good
---
Haha yours was more satisfying/mesmerizing His was also satisfying in a ‚Äúeverything worked/as planned‚Äù kind of thing and just the beauty of teamwork, and you just carried your teams defense right there in that one bomb
---
Yup, and I'm a barley with two afk team mates
---
Should be photoshopped or is in the lwarb
---
Bo more different especially with his attack animation
---
I apologize, but if you don‚Äôt get it, there isn‚Äôt any way I can help you
---
Wow, you've been downvoted a lot
---
That‚Äôs cool rho
---
Very good! Maybe make the boxes in mid possible to have more (like in feast or famine where it's random)Just so there is more reward for pretty much controlling mid

Happens to me, but that game I lost for a stupid reason. The most memorable one was where one of my teammate at the end screen clicked play again. I decided to do that too, but the 3 rd guy didn‚Äôt. The 3rd guy was in a team with the other guy so both of them left. That put me into matchmaking by myself. I crashed before I saw the matchmaking screen, but I was the 6th player and after my game reloaded, my team was in a bad spot 
---
My losing streak was 6 games before I switched to a different brawler
---
**Incorrect. The bricks speak to me.**

I think the skin should be called Fish-tick

Perfect, especially because Primo is goddamn velcro and way faster than he needs to be.
---
In a simple way I was able to get rid of the forced orientation locked and trough flipping my screen back and forth I came to this. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt really grant any advantage tho since other brawlers will be invisible if they‚Äôre out of a certain range. Also can‚Äôt use your super.

CEAAAASAAAAAAAR

This is dudu

Yeah he was the worst then nut the first buff was enough. Also other brawlers now need a buff

And they say dynamike can't defend in Brawl Ball!!

This is from a WWF pamphlet...

If a teammate kick the ball, the shield stays until the ball stop moving

How many brawler trophies?

I already see 10 Shelly Supers in my face just by looking at this.

Hello food

I‚Äôm gonna be honest. White Mecha Bo looks better than Gold Mecha Bo (to me) so I‚Äôd say buy Gold Mecha Crow with that

i like this

Take my upvoteüòÑ
---
am i the only one who thinks that heist is annoying? Most matches are pretty much decided at the start. Not much of a chance for a comeback. 
---
Throwers are really annoying on some maps because they can sit behind a wall and attack the safe. 
---
Players respawn too quickly. After you kill someone attacking your safe, by the time you reach the centre of the map when you go to counterattack, you will probably meet that exact same player.
---
You are forgiven
---
Ok zoomer

It‚Äôs look like a little buff

Or token doublers

FBI open up!

I like the buff crow in the cloud

Poor brock doesn‚Äôt get a say in this

 you do have star power

Thats not always right though
---
It‚Äôs not so big, it‚Äôs just a thing who don‚Äôt let you start matches when you have bad wi-fi

It‚Äôs probably bots

Dont have to make leon even easier for the 11 year olds to play

Where is the turret? Great cosplay btw.

Np :3
---
?? What‚Äôs wrong??
---
damnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
---
I agree that BS is in a good state right now especially after the recent updates but in a slight decline. 
---
Siege really does need a tweak because it‚Äôs just a stale mode. It‚Äôs frustrating not just because of the bolt spawns but how quickly the first bot appears so it might appear while your bolt flies to your IKE. 
---
My favourite mode has to be bounty(closely following BB) but it appearing every 3 days feels too long. That‚Äôs only 4-5 times per season. 
---
I‚Äôm loving Lone Star although the maps are very open which makes the meta stale. It‚Äôs mostly filled with Pipers, Leon‚Äôs and Mortus. Same with Takedown. Only colt or Bull is viable and only colt in lower trophies because everyone attacks each other so close range brawlers get targeted. I think the takedown maps need to be more open to allow for other long range brawlers. And maybe some very closed maps to allow for throwers and close rangers. 
---
Life leech is an extremely fun mode, but the meta really is stale. The only viable brawlers are piper, crow, Spike and Pam, and ticks on hot maze. However it‚Äôs not permanent and Frank said that it‚Äôs not as popular as Lone Star or takedown. I‚Äôd like to say that they‚Äôll add it as a sd modifier but I highly doubt  it‚Äôs coming back until next Halloween. 
---
What you said about the subreddit is very accurate. Mods are nonexistent in here which is the main reason why there are so many garbage posts. They should get some more mods somehow to regulate the rules that no one follows right now. 
---
I‚Äôm glad you did a state of the game for BS. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this took you more time than the other two state of the game posts. I suggest you post this in r/brawlstarscompetitive because you‚Äôll get better feedback there.
---
Well yea, that's why you don't really encounter dynamike much on higher trophies, but you encounter piper every few games and she's most of the time trash and also on your team, so i think piper is the staple of being bad in bb, cause on higher trophies, you don't encounter people playing bad brawlers for the mode anymore, but the pipers you encounter a trash, piper would be good if you encounter a good piper, but they most of the times are trash (like mortis, he is damn good in bb, but just if you are skilled, 99.999% of mortis players in bb are trash, so people thought he is bad in bb cause of them)
---
there was no reason to show how dummy thicc she is
---
but i appreciate it
---
Wolf,	The cooler Wolf
---
Piper is great if you have a Bo with star power
---
Me playing with my sister

I like it better than any other solo mode, even with all the Ticks and Pipers. They're fast matches, too.
---

I really love this best concept art I have seen here and if it were added he would be my favourite brawler 11/10
---
When they nerf his invisibility to 1 second
---
Idiot
---
no the shelly broke the wall. the shot would‚Äôve hit a box
---
Power play is meant to be a competitive mode, not for new players. Having level 9 capped would just ruin the point as star powers ARE a huge part of gameplay.
---
 
---
&gt;**Ticketed Events**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;These game modes are getting pretty stale, due to having them appear only on weekends, and each mode appearing once every 3-4 weeks. Supercell should make these "special" events be available either "everyday" or at least open on FRIDAY (3 days instead of 2 days). They should cycle more frequently.
---
So you're telling me that having them appear every day would make it less stale?
---
&gt;  but most of the excellent concepts and art don't get a lot of attention. 
---
Most of them are trash and that's why the upvote / downvote system exists.
---
&gt;**Trophy Road**  
---
&gt;We should all agree that the trophy road needs to be improved, a lot. There are some tiers/milestone where you only get 300 gold, then 150 after. That's just plain disappointing when you have to push a ton of trophies, only to get 300 gold as a milestone reward. And there's a catch. Once you hit 15000 trophies, that's it. No more trophy road for you.  
---
&gt;Here are some suggestions on rewards that can possibly improve the trophy road (I'm not asking for free rewards, just improve them):  
---
&gt;**Reward the player one random legendary brawler** (that you haven't unlocked yet) at about 10000 trophies. By receiving your reward, it won't affect your drop rate. This will not only solve the complains of not getting legendaries at higher trophies, but also improving the trophy road as a whole. *(If you have all the legendaries, then you'll unlock a brawler you don't have. If you have all the brawlers, then you'll get gold/powerpoints/or a brawl box)*
---
oMMMG gIvEE mEE mOrE fFRRREE sSTUFF!!

&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; Community Skins: There should be more of this: Having one Community skin (Such as Shark Leon) in each update will encourage content-creator to create more skin ideas. You have a community for a reason; maybe consider some of our ideas. If there is a reason why you *don't* want to add any ideas from the community (maybe issues with plagiarizing or stealing ideas), then we understand. 
---
Ryan said that this wouldn't really be possible as pinpointing where a skin originated is quite difficult. For example, I saw like 6 posts of people saying they came up with the idea of FootBull.

Uh, what I‚Äôve always tried is having a brawler like crow or anyone who can jump and reset the battle. I usually use crow, reset the fight, then I win. Maybe you can try that
---
I was about to say did u just steal this
---
I know but brawlers so far apart shouldn't be able to play together. That's the solution
---
All games have exploit and flaws that are too hard to fix, but overall, I understand your idea. But all games get tiring in the end. If you don't want to quite brawl stars and is just tired of it, just open a new account. I was tired of not getting any epic brawlers (I have none) even as I was already 9k, so I created a new account. All the grinding stress was gone, you could enjoy the game again, but you aren't frustrated because you still retain your original progress. (Unless you didn't connect to Supercell ID) Also, we shouldn't make Supercell update too fast. Once a month is a pretty fast rate. I think they should slow update rate to 2 months, or it it will end up like Clash Royale. People expected new cards too fast, and Supercell ran out of ideas. We have to give them time for new ideas. If they run out of ideas, they will start making weird ideas that players hate (such as the rearranging of cards in Clash Royale, which made me quit, and the fact my account got hacked. ) Matchmaking is by far I think the ting that needs to be improved most. Teaming is almost impossible to eliminate, you can minimize the efforts, but if Supercell starts banning people for teaming, some people may not be actually teamming, and it will cause a greater uproar, and result in even more rigorous quitting of the game. Since you are banned, it will technically be impossible to justify that you weren't teaming.

Because when you try to get her she can shoot you and fill her Super at Medium Range, shoot the Super and that doesn't defeat you she finishes with normal shots.
---
Kind of sad tbh
---
I can't deni anything you've just said lol
---
Oh fuck thats alotta boxes
---
Try uploading it again at a different time. Maybe change your title to something else aswell?
---
Gotta grab ur ass
---
Because when I joke about something, people never take it as a hoke and I just get downvoted to hell...and you are saying that I cant take a joke...NOT TRUE! Just look at the people in this sub...
---
just take the old phone with you in a different country and just log in with it, then switch to the other phone
---
You also spelled throwing wrong
---
Yes with randoms
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
Maybe your joke isn't good? That's why no one laughs?
---
Literally. Every. Time.

Snake Pairie 2.0 and u won‚Äôt be even be able to see the Ike turret boundary lmao
---
Oh yeahhh. 10:50 pm shitpost.
---
Bo sp
---
I agree. Ive just seen people asking for one and an opportunity to make a meme with the best builder of walls. If you look through the comments there are some interesting ideas tho.
---
So you're just going to ignore the star power
---
You forgot emz
---
i have a brawler
---
Dont worry I'm not your average reddit scum
---
After update my change drop for 0.920 to 0.600. Why supecell?
---
How you do this?
---
Oh now youre saying that? And spike raping jessie is good? Funny? NORMAL??? He isnt even a human it would more logical if they made the same joke but with leon...and point is that even if my joke isnt funny, or good, they take it seriously...not as a joke at all.
---
Rosa pls pass the ball
---
Doom is playing with his last 2 braincells. Wtf is he even doing..
---
That is actually amazing.
---
Lol why does everyone think a wall=fortnite? I dont know how it would work but with people asking for it i saw a great opportunity for a meme with the best builder of walls.
---
Why‚Äôd you kill em?
---
Why mexican related?
---
It is called Albus, he is a ghost shooting bubble orbs. his super is a big owl (a pet) flying over walls and stuff for 15 seconds. the owl can't die before the time is up, only in the storm. i hope u guys like it!
---
"interesting" ?
---
What‚Äôs the point of this post
---
Big hacker
---
r whosh cringe reattard!!!!1!!1 that is sound of joke flying over head!!!!!1!1!!
---
Witch Shelly
---
sandy started it, i was gonna join them
---
Yeah...but his super is a little underpowered tho. I would put invisiheal back to 800 health and his super to 7 seconds again...he was balance before this...
---
I kinda agree. Maybe the wall is a super that is hard to get and has HP that a basic attack can kill. I just saw meme potential with the best builder of walls.
---
Because joe Mama told me
---
"There is always a bigger fish."
---
aprox 1 week after this event ending we get new teaer or brawl talk.. SC is getting predictable
---
So do people that payed for stuff lose their money? I never played the game so idk
---
Dude this is awesome. I love it. Numbers could probably be tuned a bit but overall stellar concept.
---
I‚Äôve been playing since beta so I have a lot of brawlers maxed
---
*piece
---
And they say OJ was never seen again
---
Thanks! I‚Äôm debating removing the middle spawn in canyon so you‚Äôre not pinched. The feedback helps a lot!
---
Yes,but I have Bandita Shelly.(the "star" skin should be for Rico this year.)
---
Was it a post supporting teaming?
---
But spike is the best counter for shelly
---
Hungry for some pussüçë(Amazing art btw)
---
And u decided to kill them poor people
---
Burn
---
Is a 0.16 chance good?
---
Same, right under .26 here
---
*there will always be a random who don't check bushes
---
Yep, I got a legendary on those. 4k trophies.
---
Uita»õi-vƒÉ la profilu' meu.Am fƒÉcut un skin pe Bibi.(m-am inspirat din versul"Zrean»õo a venit Abi!
---
Chiar!)
---
Say that to the guy I blocked...hes insulting me just because I have my opinion? What is this bullshit
---
Look at my profile.
---
Oof
---
Wait what????
---
He‚Äôs saying it seems like 0% cause in all reality it actually is really close to 0%, hence the immense difficulty to pull a legendary
---
Ok, anyone saying that this is an attempt at art theft, they‚Äôre clearly not looking. This poster never claimed it as original, and all the artists info is still on the pic.
---
Just by your username i knew your account was like a month or two old
---
Lone star in power play is not that bad ......
---
Just try to get as many kills as possible 
---
I got 2 3rd places and one 2nd place and I m at 480 points 
---
3v3s with randoms r the worst so I like showdown, lone star n takedown in powerplay
---
And that's shows you're a dumb kid
---
You didn‚Äôt care enough to get it lol
---
And tickets...I have fucking 374 tickets...I'm spending them but it is impossible to spend all of them.Every box i open,i have tickets.
---
Thank you!
---
Why? It could come even later y'know
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry Brock, God has blessed you.‚Äù
---
This is amazing if you need help tell me
---
I really want Bibi :p
---
9 days
---
Colt don't do it
---
Vote up and take my up shot. This is quality
---
They're sorry for the three people in Canada who actually played
---
I‚Äôm 100 power points away from power 9 colt and am 3 gems away from the 150 offer. Opened 10 boxes and didn‚Äôt get any gems.
---
Thanks man
---
0/10 , not enough scrappy
---
Jokes aside, that's an awsome cosplay not gonna lie!
---
*leavenot*
---
bruh.
---
So sad..
---
never liked the game but this is pretty sad
---
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Hahaha thank you! I really wanted to build Scrappy, but it's huge and hard to travel with it!
---
My clubmate tried it by putting a code üòÇ
---
The 1st panel is my whatsapp wallpaper
---
There is nothing to do he's hilariously bad
---
Actually, don‚Äôt feel too worry about him
---
I peaked on the Rush Wars reddit and saw a post, it says the purchased gems in Rush Wars will be TRANSFERRED to ANY supercell games of THE PURCHASER‚ÄôS CHOICE
---
Meaning, anyone who spend lots of gems in Rush Wars will earn lots of gems in one of the following: Clash of Clans, Boom Beach, Hay Day, Clash Royale or Brawl Stars
---
I was gonna say the same thing, the guy knows something for sure
---
It‚Äôs just Esports :/
---
lol
---
*lord forgive me for what im about to do*
---
Seems a bit one sided tho
---
NERF TICK SUPERCELL
---
NL :p
---
Should i tell him
---
But he's also broken, he out dmgs and ranges the other throwers
---
So r u
---
I got 1st 1st and 5th with leon but i get where youre at brawl ball fking sucks coz all the morons scoring thier own goal
---
The damage needs a major buff
---
Photoshop happenend
---
Prc dat
---
He‚Äôs balanced
---
A for effort, buddy! üëç
---
If you get hit by all 3 mines, that‚Äôs just on you tbh. They decreased the explosion radius so it‚Äôs hard to hit all 3. My guess is you just walk into them. His range is pretty far, I‚Äôll give you that, but hitting all 3 mines consistently is impossible :p
---
The most effort i ever put into a meme
---
I knew it from the start. Nobody wanted this game tbh.
---
I peaked on the rush wars reddit and a post said that Those who spend money on Rush Wars will earn gems based on the amount of money they spend in any other supercell games on their choice
---
yeaahh you should -\_-
---
r/shittybrawlstars
---
Like that +50 plus trophies actually mean anything. You didnt lose because matchmaking is bad, you lost because you're bad at the game
---
Looks amazing!
---
no powerpoints for me since i get every brawler to lvl9 after some boxes..
---
idc
---
But if you want to chain supers you need to be really close to brawlers you know. Thats why long range brawlers like spike outplay her.
---
You couldn't almost spin because of your sweat
---
Figured that would happen
---
–¢—É—Ç—É
---
Idk man
---
Yeah, I saw that too, at least they didn‚Äôt lost it :)
---
However, with money cost I was referring to the game develop cost
---
Offtopic but personally, i hate people who irrationally spend money on some game and when it either closes or doesn't meet their expectations at all, they complain
---
i once found a kid on tik tok and he said he had 10000000 trophies
---
*hello darkness my old friend*
---
How do you transfer gems? Because for some reason, I have a lot on my account.
---
If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre talking about, then I‚Äôll give an F too
---
Happy cake day!
---
Good luck buddy!
---
Bruh momento üßêüëå
---
don't mess with us Leon mains  
---
we will post bad fanarts of skin concepts and spin for no reason after killing you
---
Oh, thanks
---
Thanks!
---
Uhm, the brock was auto-aiming at the start and then he randomly decided not to kill you and shoot his super at the other shelly
---
Where am i at 14k PB 15.4k?
---
I amn't
---
That‚Äôs not a bug. If your teammate send something in chat you can see it.
---
tough‚Üíthought*
---
Just so you know
---
No, only a little graphic change (like Frank‚Äôs), Supercell confirm that
---
Should I buy it now since it's on sale
---
Vs a dinamike tick and piper, is just imposible to get near. Normal she died so many times
---
Me too
---
Guys, I'm actually wrong.
---
While trying to post replays on this account, it didn't work. It said "Video submissions weren't allowed on this subreddit" and right now I think I'm the only one who can't post replays.
---
I have 16.9k and no legendary
---
"Ass"
---
Well..since i see a nota in the bottom i suggest u do Nita
---
not only memes but youtubers , people on twitter ,...
---
Fun fact: I dont care ;)
---
You must've been proud of yourself back then right? I didn't realize that teaming was such a b*tch move until later and i thought i was good. Ah yes. What was i thinking
---
yeah but i think we should generalize a bit just for the sake of avoiding confusion
---
I got sandy on my mini today üòç well mini is not mini anymore lol, 10.5k 1 legendary. Normal account is 3 legendaries with 15.5k trophies
---
Yes it was lol
---
It was lol
---
when you see a random piper on your team in brawl ball
---
r/whoosh
---
Auto-criticism?
---
[deleted]
---
But why
---
Low effort
---
Ok
---
they worth it?
---
Awesome suggestion. I hope Supercell sees this!
---
Well yea but I‚Äôm looking at things from close range fights. Bull should be the best, but Shelly has more range but does less damage, which is balanced. But Shelly with her super or even only halfway charged, can easily take out a bull. Which doesn‚Äôt seem to make sense, because they made bull to be the strongest up close, but bull is easily dominated by Shelly.
---
i like
---
Thought‚Äî&gt; thot
---
 the same thing happened to me
---
0 - Lone star
---
0 - takedown
---
Exactly. I do not know what they where thinking picking Shelly on Bounty (Shooting Star)
---
If you genuinely think that crow is bad right now, you really need to look at virtually any of Kairos Time's videos on him.
---
I can agree but my friends say she is so good in meta rn
---

---
btw it only works for purchased gems
---
It‚Äôs pocos bone
---
Oof i didnt bought anuthing in Rush wars
---
Bruh
---
Cause its basically a killsteal-fest. Idk I just get super frustrated playing it cause usually i do 90% of the damage to someone and then my kill gets taken by somebody else with longer range than me
---
This map is mainly made for shotgunners. If this map actually somehow gets into the game, my username is NotSean and player code is #29Q2LRJQ2.
---
I actually like take down. I think it has two separate elements: killing the robot and killing others. So it‚Äôs interesting and challenging.
---
Lone star is a bit tricky. I feel like some maps are just too big. It takes forever to find someone. Lol. But I like to play solo showdown more than any other mode so my opinions are biased. 
---
Tl;dr - takedown - 9
---
Lone star - 8
---
Edit: grammar
---
This subreddit needs more people like you, I really agree with this post. While I think the game is at a good state, there are definitely some problems that needs to be looked into. And I agree this subreddit needs to be taken more seriously, while there is subreddits like r/brawlstarscompetitive not everyone knows it, and this subreddit is flooded with low effort memes all the time. Really liked this post and hopefully people make more post like this
---
But not in competetive power play,im too lazy to write it up here,so search for johnB4 in that thread,he wrote about the problem of the mode in power mode.
---
And Mortis can duke Frank with his attacks
---
I remember once I got 15...
---
Really are u stupid crow got like 100 buffs
---
Mortis is fine, is only very hard to use
---
Thank god
---
For one second I thought you were brazilian!
---
Yep and with the exception of the 30 gem skins I bought every one of them when they were on discount or before their price was jacked due to a remodel
---
I really want Gene. Also, nice
---
I think lone star is perfect for power play
---
I sorry am not no great languaging in the language department
---
I know. Well play dude
---
666?!?!?!
---
What program did you make this with? Its so amazing yo
---
The importantance of the post is to declare action in both the game and the subreddit (especially). Some times I really hate scrolling through the subreddit posts, only to see low effort memes on the very top (even today this happens), and usually, they are repetitive
---
Lmao at this point i think op is retarted
---
Cuz they dont have any brain cells
---
same here in Guam
---
What do you get from brawl boxes once you have everything?
---
don't worry, it's okay if you are not able to talk the language of england's language
---
I got my sandy from the blue shitty crate, honestly tho, it caught be off guard. My legendary chance was 0.3 big oof goodbye chance drop rate
---
*Dogs are better that cats*
---
I thought you speak spanish
---
F
---
he's good if you place him in the middle and with a decent placement.
---
Except you can‚Äôt.
---
hahahaha :D
---
you thank normal human I know how to speak the normal huma- I mean *COOL KID VOICE* you english words
---
I would buy sakura spike
---
I would like to play with somebody like you in brawl ball, and not talking about carry, i mean im 14-15k tr. But it would be interesting and funny how you joke on the rivals... üòÇ
---
I like it , but it will be coleer with bones and rocks when him walks
---
Well,its your opinion,have a nice day))
---
Already knew... but spike will never have a voice! It‚Äôs a real shame tho, spike is one of my fav brawlers
---
What are you watching on YouTube?
---
Mortis gang
---
*Sir u have my respect*
---
In that moment you realize that tick in the beta was a tank for he's health üòÇ
---
Emz feels much squisher though.
---
Ah, I see. I was wondering how
---
they also had in the first game previews in the play and app store many brawlers with 666 hp.
---
‚ÄúCarry rawl ball away‚Äù
---
***:) ***
---
Where ya at
---
that is why people like brawl starts because its totally different from their other games. So to make a better game they have to make a different kind of game and not another base game.
---
Goodüëç
---
Hi, meme expert here, you‚Äôre using the format wrong this meme is supposed to have a dumb thought or opinion on the sign and the guy is supposed to keep his mind unchanged on his stupid thought or opinion like orange juice is better than apple or maybe Mortis is the worst brawler
---
I'm so jealous of you :((((
---
Mortis with Coiled Snake is really good in this mode.
---
cool artstyle!
---
No, i want to mean that i hope they will buff him in season 6.
---
Go get some help man
---
Who wants a crow buff?
---
I have your answer here:instagram @nelo.artmaster üëçüèºüòâ
---
So what season are they in? Season 5?
---
‚ÄúTropy‚Äù
---
Like everybody I guess
---
no.

---
************:)************
---
how is this guy supposed to know that they have posted this half year ago???
---
So in order to post something you have to look in every single reddit posts from years ago to see if somebody already did this?? wtf
---
A man of good word
---
wow, good job. I maxed my first one today with 28 brawls
---
Stop crying you still have 8 days left
---
I happened to  make typo is there an issues?
---
No nobody wants a buff for him
---
To show your actual game experience. Some one with exp lvl20 knows more about the game than a lvl10
---
It is sad that you gotta put your name in everything to avoid those damn insta-reposters :(
---
Really? That‚Äôs frustrating, I love to play Dynamike and just got him as my first rank 25 (which I did fully in Graveyard Shift, actually), but everyone seems to hate Dyna for some reason. Maybe it‚Äôs those sorts of people that make others feel like that haha
---
So what?
---
Yeah, I just played today to embarrass people, would be happy to play with you at some point but I might not play to standard in all match. Highest 19k tr ;)
---
Oooof. Ok
---
Or just luck
---
Nothihg. I think I'm done here. I go grab some oatmeal in the meantime
---
Just dm me your code and I‚Äôll play with you tomorrow if you wish. Off to bed now and have school till around 5 tomorrow:)
---
No it would be the same result either way
---
No, the slowest is dwo showdown
---
Looks like gedi kors aqua gene
---
omg! legndarie impossiblle!!!! fuck suprcell!!! 
---
I love how the guy with the sandy hat is actually in the background of the Leon guy therefor the Leon guy is talking to someone else
---
Yup! I‚Äôm so jealous. I wish they let US do beta tests. I wanted to play brawl stars for so long but didn‚Äôt wanna make a canadian ID or whatever haha. I usually will try buying tickets and a doubler when robo rumble comes around though ü§ë
---
Looks great
---
Such a pro that being #1 was not enough
---
Wp bro, takes a lot to get 1k. Me myself got to 900 with mort and shells but gave up. Mind me asking you highest tr?
---
Oh ok
---
THANKS she needs to be nerf too
---
Yeah it was snake prairie but instead of bounty it was gem grab I don't remember the name of it too
---
I wanted to post an mod demonstration for another game, which includes Brawl Stars Sounds added into the game, but I don‚Äôt think it would gather a lot of attention. I agree to the state of this subreddit with that most of high effort posts getting over shadowed by low effort posts. What I think this subreddit needs to do better on low effort posts is to be only allowed on one day and a day where no memes are allowed (same from the r/TF2). From the state of this subreddit, I do not know if my post will get a lot of attention (if it‚Äôs moderate/high) or dies in new. I hope your post will get a lot of upvotes, so your message can be heard from the entire subreddit.

Where is santa Mike

Reddit is teaming to Destroy the teaming

No problem dude, I knew it would happenüòÇüòÇ

---
teaming is a strategy
---
That's the joke that there's a normally dinamike
---
Back then, me and my friends saw teaming as fun and backstabbers were evil. I actually got made at my friend for backstabbing. I used to even sacrifice at showdown for a teammate that was loyal.

Jokes aside.

Wait why are they closing rush wars ?

That how it is for me literally I have all the brawlers at under 6k
---
Yes i am
---
shat do you mean?
---
actually I would really prefer it if they changed her name in English to Catrina Piper. "Calavera" is literally just the Spanish word for "skull," whereas Catrina is the name of a traditional skeleton character and getup from the Day of the Dead celebration.

It took me a second to realize that the title was lyrics of that firework song lol
