Yes is good, but Snappy makes Piper so much better

Same, and I was hoping that would be the case. Unfortunate indeed. Still better than anything we got b4.

If you dont get mythics or legendaries at low trophies you will never have them.

A must!

I like the spike one behind tick

Omg ikr

I don’t see any tentacles

But i need the gold because i have 13 brawlers to upgrade.

Nice

10k is pretty easy to get to know. With the trophy system being changed people can easily get that many trophies. Itll take time yes but it’s still not as hard as it used to be.

Awesome.

Nah chief, it’s all good! I love constructive criticism, for it improves my work for the better! Btw, I had stage 4 cancer in the 6th grade, your criticism is nothing compared to that crud. Cheers mate!

I disagree.

Then they play no longer be legendary they play be trophy road reward

Okay I think I know what happened here, as the match ended the Bo held their attack button and after his winning animation shot one they used the actual attack, which would explain why no arrow shot out at the end of the victory animation even tho there are supposed to be 3 arrows shot, I believe that shooting one with the attack button desynced the animation

Its free go to mortis and switch outfits

double trophy loss
---
Visible confusion lets try if we can dig in matchmake system and use it benifically..... Lol
---
It was me and two other randoms. They even passed the ball, it was beautiful. One loss, they both bailed. Bittersweet memory, but yeah, I had things to do as well.
---
Dont know why you guys complain that much
---
Just save gems
---
It takes time but its guaranteed
---
Took me like 2 months to get the gems and Leon to show up in the store
---
What a mystery
---
Yes, but he also needed the power cube as the shield alone would not have been enough.

Piper ending in the air like always

---
You know how star player is based on damage for the match? It’ll be really cool for it to have all types of achievements like most dps, least deaths, most dps on losing team, most supers charged, most kills, and a worst player of all of the titles I said. Good incentive and an even better idea! 👍
---
Wow! Speed art, I like it!
---
Ahh! It hurts me eyes
---
Now we are waiting for the Spike skin in the background.
---
oh my god, wtf you scarred me for life
---
we are not god
---
Thanks hope my friend appreciates your comment!
---
Did this actually happen, and how did it affect the game?
---
Then you upgrade her to level nine and it’s ok
---
I’ve faced this twice tonight. Pretty proud that I’m 1-1 because it is rough.
---
Yay I'm star player
---
Android issues.
---
Star player on the losing team? Do exceptional, hope you did more damage then your opponents and play the objective. It's extremely rare, but possible.
---
Then it says clash royale &gt;:((((
---
Lol, I was legit about to quit today cuz “no legend 10k”, and I hit 10k. I decided to open my box, and I got spike. Now all my luck for the next 5 years is gone.
---
He can shoot icicles and his super can be a heating unit :D
---
Well, would ya look at that! First I get put into Coach Cory’s meme review, and now my meme is being used as a template for more memes? I’m just shocked that my simple little comic received so much positivity and feedback. Thank you so much!
---
*Actually* this is a form of Pipis called Morper. The real Pipis looks different.
---
What if it was called Refriger8-Bit
---
It depends on your brawler, if you fire all your bullets at once, you can fire more than 1 projectile
---
Someone start a nice chain
---
Post this on his sub
---
When you playing at 600 trophies and your 8k friend tried to invite you.
---
yes but, I spent more then 120$ and opened more then 37 mega boxes and got a big shit
---
Tf is this. Mortis can kill a lot of brawlers easily, especially with coiled snake. Although, I do agree with the tanks. You are not aUtOmAtIcAlLy at a disadvantage unless there are tanks or Shelly’s.
---
Half the legal age means double the fun!
---
Power throw is way better in my opinion
---
Also, Mike has a great damage potential. Demolition even adds to it.
---
thats the wrong number!

The brawler that you are playing as has to be over 400 trophies, not that as long as you have a brawler that is 400 or above

I like how they are all BEARfoot. Guys BEAR with me on this. Bruce is BEARy cute. I like how Leon BEARly touches the floor. This art is BEARy cute
---
Aye I got ya back bro
---
There isn't any way that I know of, sorry. I get what you feel.
---
Wdym square? I dont see anyting my brawl stars looks exactly like this
---
I would have missed if he strafed. Look at the second ult, I  moved backward in a a straight line, allowing my shots to all connect.

---
Try facing me and you'll know the throwers power
---
Seems like a good idea, maybe a super that can also benefit other game modes, but good art😃
---
Nah you gotta be pretty retarded to be mad about. Once tick was added as a trophy road brawler, it became clear to almost everyone that pushing was necessary to get the mega boxes before brawlers replace them. We got 8 weeks since ticks release to push from 4-6k and OP was lazy. Its there fault.
---
Nice dick
---
Thx😊
---
Wtf dick
---
Idk😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Pipis
---
Wow you must have spent alot of time on it
---
DANGER: Doing it might give you hate (proceed anyway?
---
Pretty sure spike does this too
---
VERR
---
I wonder if you have enough brains and conscience to make compensation to all affected players?  impossible to play, i already lost 300 cups because of you.
---
This one sure looks like a product of a night between Penny, Dyna and Tick.
---
Am I the only one who noticed the mid-air Spike animation?

LMAO

And they take forever to expire :(

Sry, cant I dont have Crow

---
Wow... 4 days huh... weird. That's an awful long time...

/s

I think Tara attack should be buffed (charge time) and reworked to 4 cards (same damage on total) or make it less spread
---
LOL
---
nice
---
Happened to me too. I've sent a lot of messages to them and they did nothing.
---
Hey, i saw this in a Funny moments video. Did you send this video to someone?
---
Dick,WTF
---
r/blursedimages
---
Can we get a ton of gold and star points then if we already have all of the legendary brawlers?
---
XD
---
Which is the bad one in your opinion?
---
it was 59 on release sooo it still costs more than it used to.
---
Mortis buff. Where is it?
---
Umm what is so special about that
---
mythics cost 350.
---
Oh, right
---
if you have atleast 2 legendaries.  otherwise save for them as they are much more difficult to unlock.

One man show indeed 😁😆

I only need Mortis and Crow to have all brawlers

crock?

Such underrated post

Still very young tho.

As a all max out brawler, I only wish for "1" to appear in big box or mega box bottom right...and Im waitin' for Spike.

Here are some info on a brawler that should be in-game.

I couldn't relate to an artwork more that I can now.

Different spelling. Also, don’t be a dickhead. Everyone gets the point regardless.

Aww man, if there was a collab supercell x Nintendo this skin would be awesome
---
If the tickets are hard to get then yes great idea
---
YOOO THATS LIT!! Ive once done that on a lower level where no one cares about losing. Also... 🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷
---
If this happens to be in the game, there gotta be a tiny slice called "new legendary brawler" and I (with all other &gt;10K no leggy gang) will just pass it by and get the 15 coins that takes the massive pie

Nothing wrong here.

I still hate how this skin looks

This is so true.
---
LEGENDARY
---
Oh right my bad
---
it's ugly but in a fun way
---
Is this a new copypasta?
---
Wow you uploaded this twice
---
From adult straight up to kid wow
---
My opinion. I'm talking to a wall rn.
---
I love Crow’s voice though. It’s great comedy relief for the game.
---
Ok im not sure if it's just my eyes but the fps feels a lot better definitely not 60 though, I just cleared a bunch of space on my phone and it jumped from like 30 fps to 45
---
If you have all 25 not legendary brawlers 14.5k would be 580 average trophies, which is a lot imo
---
You just have to move the right joystick
---
Nah its ok
---
We won this one.
---
Idk i feel like supercell would add anything, they even added transformers skins ahah
---
I say 12.5K or 13K
---
Impressive job
---
And happy cake day
---
You can’t just tell people WHY they won’t add GEDI’s skins. You gotta tell people why you THINK they won’t add GEDI’s skins if it’s your opinion.

this is g r e a t

what if we had the option to create our own brawler
---
you can create your own brawler for once choose the type, change the look and choose the weapon you can also choose the winning animation and losing animation i am not sure about the price if it will cost coins or gems or maybe star points?
---
How about ending the game with my PhOnE in the air lul
---
I know right!
---
Rip same problem here.
---
Did you... even try?
---
Its just brawler design
---
Lmao I heard it exactly the way it's meant to be
---
HAhA FunNY 69 Haha

The 6 is a leon

*Dynamike wants to know your location*

Ya but they added many robot skins at once and had a theme. And the skins made a bit sence.

.... a match takes around 2:30 .

If you win you get 7 or 8 idk the low trophies

You aren’t bad at math ur just plain stupid

That's what I said. Goodbye!

You are in BS

Bruh look at your own title.
---
What’s the matter with being matched with a great poco? He’s good if he’s at that much trophies. Better being matched with a player with a single good brawler than a guy with 20 200 trophy brawlers
---
Shit
---
It happened to me too
---
It looks dumb as hell and I love it!
---
Uhm im not from insta and.... Just dont rage pls

Oops you're right. Goodbye for now!

Thank you

No i ment in average i take like .19 sec
---
They just nerfed her
---
oh oof
---
I have all the brawlers right now i got crow from a brawl box somewhere at 5000 trophies, after that again comed the robots update i bought spike with the new skin,and Leon just apeard again out of a brawl box at 11000+ trophies . I guess i got lucky then. :D
---
Wtf lol
---
I’m at 8k and just got Spike. I’ve only had Leon for a couple weeks also.
---
Not
---
Gratula a global top 1 hez

You said 0.5 whaa- 0.2 seconds is usually enough time to flick. Otherwise, you are dead. Even with auto aim.
---
 Hello runirex, I wanted to make a spreadsheet with a lot of the data from brawl stars, one of what is the Hall fame, I was wondering If we can partener together.
---
Funny

Shelly is balanced right now...

Downvote ASAP!

What does Brock have to do with it tho. Why brock? Also if that Shelly had shell shock then yeah

Not really, just he has a low chance for epics now

I would like to see you do it post a. Vid of you flicking his star power
---
I would, but I don’t have his star power. And bots are ass lul.
---
I think they should be a little more common than gems, a little bit though
---
k
---
I know it's joke, also my reply is joke
---
In brawl ball defend your tank
---
In gem grab and bounty defend hihg values
---
And kill everyone you can if this doesnt mean risk loosing(if you have gems of stars on you)
---
Wutttt? You can speak normal? 
---
#OMG
---
i wish if poco had a star power just like the kritz on tf2 he will boost all hes team damage by 20% for 5 sec
---
Y does it look like pipers stand is crow
---
Go into the game, click on one of your 500 brawlers rank
---
So you should be quite
---
So are you saying that the buttons on 8-bit are nipples? And when he loses he just starts fingering his nipple?
---
I have the star power
---
of course
---
Frank said that everyone who doesn't have remodel yet will get one eventually ex: Crow El Primo Pam Etc.
---
He wrote "I scored 4 goals"
---
I’m at 17k without legendaries
---
Might as well make an 8 bit slot machine skin
---
To be honest ur arts are very good but that underrated? No..

ciao

It should be nintendo-bit or 8-switch or 8-bit switch

Stop the 69 jokes. It was never funny and it is still not funny.
---
LoL
---
It's photoshopped
---
Perhaps
---
I am F2P too and started in June. On 12.2k but have only 23/28 brawlers :(
---
wait so if hes 80 that means he doesnt have brawler effects huh
---
Yes I for one am also blind, the only way for me to know is the violent tremors from my phone for the shaking.
---
you didnt needed to say that since r34 is like literally that...
---
Supercell *clearly* states that matchmaking is based on the trophy count of the current brawler, not overall trophy count
---
Not funny didn't laugh
---
no I was alone in my lobby and it paired me with a low trophy.
---
Yeah Pink Piper is love
---
i feel more satisfied when i got a legendary from hard work instead of a rigged slot machine
---
It's a joke
---
You can't add more tickets at boss fight!
---
Her super is fine...
---
It has always been and always will be funny
---
i can buy the skin for 69 right now, i might just do jt
---
then why is it marked idea

Can’t upvote there are 666 up

is it the same shop for everyone

Because it looks better than the new one

Is that the healing one?

They are still the same

Thank you for asking the real questions

Ok, may be İ am getting paranoid about it

Nope you're a dick

Don’t worry. Most of the good brawlers right now aren’t legendary. Only good one is spike and he’ll always be in the top 5. Crow is just fun to play once in a while. Leon is trash.

Take my upvote

What? Challenges? No. Getting a card to tournament standard is not difficult at all for f2p players. Yes p2w do have the advantage to retry, but it's worse with a lucky spin.

Welcome to the front page
---
Don't waste ur gems on skins use them to buy something more useful but if u really want it then it's already to cheap Id think so it would have special offer but if it would it would be around 19 or 15 gems
---
Arnt the boxes already a wheel.
---

Btw scavenger III stoled your Uno reverse card i use uno reverse card

Yes
---
Lmao...where did you find this? r/BrawlStarsP? 😂
---
Shitpost
---
Idk why but idc
---
Being higher in trophies doesn’t mean you’re supposed to be handed brawlers. Don’t know why people are like “don’t have Leon and I’m 12k.” Bro you would only be 8-9k if the trophies weren’t inflated.
---
In my opinion
---
Absolute God of destructuon right?
---
I have 9K trophies and I have 1 legendary now, cause I bought it ... It's sad.
---
I bought last week by 150 gems ;-;-;-;-;
---
Only legendaries have a luck value

Wow i would like that zomeraanbieding

Yes please

Wait wtf?

Just unlocked a Legendary Brawler on my Free to Play Account in my most recent video:

https://youtu.be/PBVaC-V42no
---
(Wasn’t who I was expecting.😕)
---
Show the entire video ...I bet you lost after that moment
---
Im too lazy to even understand what's happening
---
11k still no legendarys.
---
I belive the correct term is "he never existed this is my account"
---
Imo sounds useless
---
Lmao
---
My bet was that it's the damage of the super, penny did 7.1k. tick did 8832. Jessie does 2k.
---
Ideas
---
Isnt bibi just a teen 🤔
---
I don't know, sounds a little complicated. They should have this Brawler at 10k to make it more fair.
---
25 seconds was mine I don't know what is THE fastest time
---
Let me press F in the world smallest Keyboard

This is a dumb post because it's obvious how you got 510 trophies while still rank 21

Your the second person to do this, I think.  And u were playing with the first one

She needs teeth.  That smile is way too big to not be showing some teeth.
---
Also, it's weird her eyebrows don't match her hair but TBH I haven't looked closely enough at Pam nor Colt's in-game models to see if they're mis-matched, too.
---
Otherwise, I've never really had a problem with it.
---
Xoxoxo 😂
---
I don't believe it does.
---

I've had everyone except Bibi Leon and spoke since 3.5k

My luck had run out though

But why would they try to open them?
---
What?
---
Old meme
---
YDE entered the chat

---
W A A  A H
---
G O L D E N N I C E
---
amateurs, i've got 890k trophies without shelly, amateurs
---
Hey, are you a blet?
---
They don’t like that I have 20+ boxes there just doing nothing at any given time so they open them probably bc they think it’ll annoy me, which it really doesn’t, I’ll open them eventually.
---
From my point of view I think this is a great idea it will give me a barrier so i dont open boxes because I'm maxed out and I should save boxes so I can get power points  for any newly released  brawler
---
One of your enemies had 108 so it’s even
---
OMG
---
Agreed dude
---
You're a imposter!!!
---
USE FIXED JOYSTICK its much easier
---
There is. I got leon at 12k mega box lol
---
10k and I only have spike.
---
now I'm missing all of the mythics, Crow and Leon.
---

1-brawl tv is not working since the update 2-fix the lag please in the summer update i lagged every 3 matches now after this update i lag every match even tho i use 4G internet 3-i stopped playing solo showdown because of lag
---
Nice! Thought I knew everything about this game. Apparently I don’t.
---
bruh. First world problem.
---
I’m not talking about his gameplay really.. the fact that he’s at 500 and has the common sense and intelligence of a 3 year old is worth taking note of
---
nice repost
---
Glad to see I’m not the only one that thinks it’s annoying. Really thought I’d come up with an original idea. Thanks for pointing out others work!
---
Go to a damn church
---
Once I suggested that months ago. People were downvoting me to hell, saying it was useless. At least you got attention.
---
r/antidariusbrawlstars
---
could be a huge middle finger though. Imagine grinding for twelve hours for 6 tickets
---
Back to school 😢 … I don’t like school 🏫
---
Mcree’s stun grenades
---
Epic
---
Good thing for Jessie scrappy is there to tank genes super.
---
I've probably reinstalled the game 5 times. I usually like to play Nita. Can get to 500 trophies easy. But when you reach 500, it gets harder cause you realize everyone maxed out their brawlers and you're still on power 3
---
We ArE GoNnA mISs YoU, MaN WhO I DonT ReAlLy KnOw
---
 Wow that’s epic, see you in hot homie
---
Randoms suck in Boss Fight.
---
Don’t you do it, don’t you say those words
---
First and only!

Im 9k and I only need Crow… I'm a F2P BTW
---

---
#Hots
---
Well, technically woman of culture lol, but thanks! Rare to see other people who actually know what the game is... haha.
---
You deserve to be proud GJ!
---
Sorry, that’s no minecraft skin, I only see a cooked chicken over there
---
Sorry about that.
---
How many chromosomes did you lose
---
Wait thats illegal
---
BUBBLE TROUBLE!
---
Anyone have links to his streams or videos?
---
The super is just rosas
---
This would work as a legendary. Sence he's on the stronger side.
---
First this man gets gold mecha bo and now he's the first man to get rank 35 bo
---
Well except it reflects not absorbs
---
I agree do you like the idea though?
---
So cute
---
When you die in duo, all they do is hide in the outskirts. Or when you're fighting a duo team, they just run away with full health. Or when they randomly fixate on killing a team the whole game when it's clearly not worth it, then end up getting killed. Or when they don't go for the middle where there's 7 boxes and instead focus on the 3 boxes surrounding you.
---
I play a lot of duo
---
Yeah this is one of the better bralwer concepts I've seen. Kinda want a full sized version of em'
---
See you in hot!
---
