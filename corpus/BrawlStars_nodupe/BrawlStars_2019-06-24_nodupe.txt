I would like to believe it but, he has tried this before. He showed us a silhouette of unreleased brawler once and everyone went crazy. Turns out it was fake. Maybe he isn‚Äôt lying this time, idk. But don‚Äôt get your hopes up.

Where are the Pok√©mon x Brawls Stars drawings at but good Poco Loco

Lol I‚Äôd totally buy the Maple Barely Skin

Way back in this subreddit.  I also made a dragon brawler named Milton.  I've always wanted to rework him, but my stylus for drawing broke,  and I haven't been able to for a while 
---
I'm saying this because this guy looks *WAY* better than anything I could draw up. He totally fits the style of Brawl Stars.

First and foremost in direct response to littlerabbit49's first comment- little things warm my heart. The slightest things in life make me very happy. Big or little. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
THIS POST IS ON EVERYONE'S BEHALF NOT JUST MINE
---
But on a more serious note, Hardly Mortal and memoliciouss are right. They may have said it a bit harshly, but there's no reason to disagree with everything anyone says. I do not apologize if what I say next is indelicate, because you NEED to stop, and it's not just for random people on the internet, but it will also make you happier in life. You know, it's funny since you called me "juvenile' and apparently you've done good things to children in Sudan and your really so kind and helpful, you should know how to seek happiness. (I mean if annoying everybody on the internet is your thing, I hope you have lots of fun being hated on) Judging alters a lot of your feelings towards people in general, and I strongly suggest you stop and I don't care if ignore this, or if you reply to me with some snarky or irritating comment  because I know how to "step back and relax" and "chill out". 
---
" You honestly have no life if you have the time to scroll through someone‚Äôs history"  
---
doesn't mean that they have no life it means that they were curious after reading the first comment by memoliciouss because 1) they didn't know such a person could exist or 2) because they have the time and want to. It's not up to you to criticize
---
" Holy shit, how ironic, you regularly argue with people on the internet thinking it will make a difference. You‚Äôre a dick " by hardly mortal. Thank you for expressing your opinion, which as I can say on part of everybody is a universal fact.
---
 If some random guy throwing a game of showdown warms your heart then your values are rooted in the wrong areas. 
---
lmfao says the guy hating on everyone. I believe your values are not only rooted in the wrong areas, but fucked up.
---
" You honestly need to take a step back and relax. You guys are just escalating this. I legit just stated my opinion on a comment and then like ten people come in looking to start online arguments 
---
Bitch your the one hating on every little thing. NOBODY cares about your opinion. And no, we are not caring for it because we are writing ted talks telling you to shut up. It'sbecause you should stop, actually.
---
//Again, at the end, I do realize this is a bit mean and it could have been more toned down, but I'm sure this needs to be said in some way or another so yeah//
---
TL;DR: Shut the f up litterabbit49 (and yes I spelt your name right this time, and I'm not going back to change it because and you can tell, nobody here cares about you.)
---
Actual TL;DR : nobody needs to read or hear hateful or annoying comments
---
you just don't like the map because you are using the wrong brawler. I prefer hot point to be removed. imo
---
Wow. I would never have done that.
---
Its not though
---
Your name on BS tells me everything :v
---
Legit the most intense game I've ever watched
---
that's because you are using a brawler that does not shine very well.
---
Maybe he is one?
---
No campers but lots of Dynas. Get rid of the wall and put cacti all over call it spiks house.
---
Some supers can make bull stand on water
---
Same here, have literally every other brawler and I can never pull in any legendaries (or gems for mega boxes)
---
9/10 female brawlers would "brawl"
---
looks liek chicken
---
Well which one would you reccomend
---

When you thought that you can escape from teaming in solo showdown so you decide to play duo showdown... But you realize that both showdowns are ruined

I'm very sorry but crow is not a short range, he is very much a long range

dear u/supercellryan, Brawl Stars could make money off a non-p2w cosmetic system (like overwatch, fortnite, pubgM, TF2, ect) but it didn't. I would gladly pay for cosmetics, but paying for a better edge in matches just feels like cheating.
---
Mythical
---
You just gotta use fitting brawlers, crow, Darryl, Pam, colt, even mortis can do quite well

I spin when I had just 20-50 hp left for example, or when I kill teamers. I also accept that people spin when I do so, no problem. But when I get killed 1v1 in a normal fight then it's annoying, but I only thing, yeah, dance, probably you're in a lose streak and only killing 1 person makes you happy.
---
I already knew something was very fishy when he posted 3 pieces of high quality art in a day. The watermarks also don't match the artwork too, and they look like scribbles by 5 year old kids. And today, he deleted all of the stolen art. 
---
However, I hope that you understand that this sub isn't that bad. We have good artists on here, and some people here post funny memes (although some are pretty unfunny there are some good ones).
---
I removed the sentences from the meme and added my own sentences. I do not have the format.

---
Maybe bigger legs? But i think it should be pet.
---
Brawl stars should add a concept called pet, after lv.10, you could add a pet, maybe barley could have this as his pet, and pets' skin follows the brawler, barley's pet:
---
Stev 
---
Attack:300
---
Hp:1400
---
When you die, he dies too 
---
When spawn, he spawns too.
---
But when he dies and you are still alive, 15 secs to spawn
---
A.I, follows where you move, doesnt know how to walk zig-zag
---
Attacks when see people, no super, bullet charge: 0.99 second, bullet space:1
---
Usual pets also get 1 space for bullet, is this a good idea?
---
If some famous youtubers liked my concept, please share and request supercell to add this!
---

You forgot the part where he says, ‚Äúthis really pisses me off‚Äù

Did you use ball pen or marker to fill in the colours?

Dont do that next time!

There is people with love out there:')

It is the brawl talk where they announced that the game was going from potrait to landscape.

yeah its so frustrating to play with people like this

No, we have &lt;barley&gt; at home.

Looks like Nita, but with long hair. Maybe pre-wilderness Nita?
---
Considering he's wearing Leon's outfit, you could say that.
---
Oh my god kill that cursed woman

Nice we ended up getting smacked as my teammates fed penny's super and I got beat up by the other two
---
Ask Leon.  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
F to pay respect
---
When your piper was at 499...
---
XD
---
super cool idea! i especially like the ammo bar mechanic. How do you control it? Can you stop firing at any moment? or does it fire until you run out of ammo? Does ammo recharge over time or only when you run out?
---
Wrong game Jevil
---
Fair enough but I felt like they were being cocky no?
---
It‚Äôs the moment that he know he f*** up
---
Hai
---
Yeah. As much as Penny‚Äôs star is op, it sucks having 2 on the same team. She‚Äôs not good for control at all until she gets her super. And shelly is just always an atrocious choice in siege. Bo ain‚Äôt great, but he‚Äôs better than shelly and bibi and barley are definitely top of the meta in siege. We had a way better team comp than you for sure. But the trophy disparity was similar.
---
Thief
---
hopefully this is more improved than my previous one
---
Thank You. You can stop firing whenever. You can use it up until you ammo is up. Therefore it will recharge wherever you left off in the ammo bar.üòâ
---
May be some kind of a prank
---
No its shiba nita
---
The one rocket he let off was so close üíÄüíÄ

The food chain of BS

Is itüòâ
---
If you look closely, past the bullet spam there *is* actually a Shelly, in purple and highlighted extra big.
---
Well that was my plan at first but everyone was whining about him not being able to open boxes with 6 shots and I figured that if I change his reload and super charge it‚Äôs basically the same Poco but more threatning and I don‚Äôt want a huge Poco anyway so I went with this, you are right I could have just increased his HP/heal/reload.
---
No he is waek
---
His weakness is the no hay
---
r/mortisgang
---
Why? Shelly should get a nerf
---
No, i get it some people gave up in the middle of the game because they feel like the game is over, but this guy intentionally losing from the start.
---
WhAT DO YOU THINK IT IS?
---
Your attitude and a lack of education and respect for others concerns me
---
Tara needs a remodel first.
---
Don't buff Bibi
---
**Please**
---
Brock and Crow came so close
---
I am nerfing herüòÖ
---
Gene doest need a nerf i think..
---
Poco's HP is actually very very solid, 5320 at power 10, to an extent where he could literally stand in as a substitute tank in Bounty, a meatshield. If Supercell won't buff his damage then we would do this as a plan B from r/PocoGang:
---
Reload decreased from 1.6 to 1.3 seconds
---
Range increased from 7 to 7.67-8 tiles
---
Super takes 4 hits to charge
---
Tbh that might actually be a lot more worth it
---
Well, I made it so it‚Äôs unlikely that you saw it
---
I'm hyped
---
Maybe special second star powers? Because video is titled Brawl STARS? Stars like Star powers
---
Invisible heal for Leon? Fuck yeah!
---
Tara, from 2.0 to 1.7 so it will make her charge super in short period
---
Yeam,an i was thinking of this too lmao
---
yaaaassss
---
The best fan art I've ever seen
---
*Hehe I said fortnite bad like everyone else can I be accepted now because I am autistic*
---
Uhm, that seems pretty broken to me, longer range, way faster reload, faster charge.
---
They are win trading

''  Frank says it‚Äôs got to keep us busy for the summer ''
---
*LIFE LEECH IS BACK*
---
Rosa
---
The thing is, if Tara can super stack, she is absolutely broken, that‚Äôs why I just increased her damage and reduced the radius.
---
I was looking for a replay i could use in a video, with credit of course, can i use this?
---
Grazie
---
Thx for listening to my advice
---
I do this too!... but not the Gene grab bc I don't have Gene... and Mortis... and Crow and Bibi and Leon and x brawlers
---
It‚Äôs not that big of a nerf, trust me. It doesn‚Äôt change any 1v1 interactions when pulling 3360 - 5320 HP brawlers.
---
Yh off go ahead. Mind linking me your channel and video when you make it?
---
Wait, so it's a repost?
---
What about the radius , Tara throw her super then the super starts too late because it takes 1.7 in the air so no radius nerf
---
Mama's squeeze meteor rush i am hyped
---
How did you find it? Since the video is unlisted
---
I can't see the video on YouTube.. hmmm.
---
What about lion dance brock imo he is best skin for brock but i don't have it
---
Except their cousin in Quebec, who is on the other team
---
It‚Äôs basically a range nerf for her super, instead of 8 tiles wide, it‚Äôs 7 tiles wide.
---
Well oiled could be for gene. He has an oil lamp.
---
It's fine if you credit him, but you said "Unknown source". Next time try to credit the original redditor.
---
A trophy Road brawler!
---
:P

World was not ready for that reference

Looks like bibi
---
It's fine don't worry I found him, nice work btw

In my country its the word dose. Like daily dose of vitamin a

Found this on Twitter, that's why i didn't know the original creator
---
da ba mmm
---
Oh I see

wouldn‚Äôt curved ball be for bibi since that‚Äôs a baseball term and she has a baseball bat

It is posted yesterday but not public. Plus Ryan said it will be tomorrow.

Who is the new brawler
---
Nice
---
Well guess what, we are getting new star powers and I don't think this update is going to have a lot of balance changes other than the penny star power.
---
What will supercellbring to us mortals
---
But what about meteor rush?
---
I just wanted to do this LOL my list was almost the same (3 star Powers different)
---
You are breathtaking.
---
Batting stance is Definitely bibis star Power , as she uses a bat. However, curved ball is yellow indicating it's a legendary's star Power. (As you can see I sorted the Star Powers by font color, and they relate to the rarity of the brawler. That's why we know the new brawler would be mythic as there are four red texts.)
---
Well she's bad at bb
---
I fixed it
---
Maybe he soaks up more damage?
---
What if ‚Äúwell oiled‚Äù is mortis‚Äô sp where he‚Äôs able to slip around the corners,etc. although i‚Äôd imagine it to be a rework of his mechanics rather than sp
---
well, considering in the brawl stars video, the star powers are colour coded (7 gray, 4 green, 4 blue, 4 purple, 4 red and 3 yellow), we can assume that the next brawler will be a Mythic and probably will be a robot (?)
---
(speculation btw)
---
Ewww those eyes!
---
I don't think colt is magnum special
---
I will add you I hope I can help
---
Healing Shade = Tara
---
Pat on the Back = Mortis
---
Coiled Snake = Gene
---
Well Oiled = New Brawler!
---
I think it looks like crow but he's a derp
---
Nah Just one of my fav youtubers of BS
---
Note: What the star power does is totally my guess, but i am sure about who they belong to
---
So desperate to comment. I will give you an upvote
---
Emphasisa
---
Nice idea! I hadn't thought of that!
---
Rosa Is My Name-.............
---
Doubtful. Lip stick on a pig. Unless there‚Äôs something that actually addresses the game‚Äôs biggest issue(matchmaking), this is just cosmetic and designed to distract from the actual issues facing the game. And judging by how freaked out people are, it‚Äôs working sadly.
---
I think Tara's and Mortis' could be switched. After watching Coach Cory's video, he explained that Tara has a shadow and that Mortis' playstyle is kind of like a snake striking when needed.
---
yeah. my clubmate was saying the same thing. well we will find out 2morrow
---
I just imagine all the brawler are reloading
---
i think is fortnite.
---
Well oiled? New robo brawler?
---
Salut si tie =)))
---
Actually the last update is pretty decent. If you compare with the other updates, they made the last update within a month with a new FUN brawler : Bibi, Minor balance changes, 3 new skins, a whole new environment and more! Players think it‚Äôs a bad update because they might have created too much hype for the new environment but players don‚Äôt actually care too much about the environments. Again, Last update was still a decent one with the short time given,
---
Hi supercell please give me crow, thanks for hard work
---
Pretty sure there will be a Mythic robot.
---
shut mouth
---
Well i finally got a way to tell Ryan directly my Idea for brawl stars well here is the
---
Idea
---
Well i thought about bibi‚Äôs mechanic and was like well why not use that reload mechanic on another brawler and i always from the beginning of creating fan characters i wanted one that could attack normally and use the thrower technic to so well by saving ammo you can throw instead of using a melee attack
---
Blyatifull
---
ok but... spike players are 9/9.0001 times better than primo players
---
along with kairos? ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
I think Curveball will have effects on Spike's main attack when it splits, making players hard to avoid those attack.
---
Yea ur right
---
And no one has star power at 531 ? Fond this hard to believe, especially when you see how bad they are
---
It'll be tomorrow, Timezone can mess with the upload date
---
I think its an old lick of a potential El primo remodel...
---
KABLAM
---
But don't tell Lec that I support Kairos.
---
Nah, they made a post about 2 star powers a while ago, its a new feature
---
WoW no one knew This!!!
---
New Mighty Brawler!!
---
New star power names or maybe new star powers
---
o ToTAllY aGrEe wIth yOU!
---
What do you have to say about that leon then? üòÇ
---
Yes I agree with you map beautiful
---
The super rare star power are wrong but otherwise that is correct.
---
Maybe it is going to affect only the super adding more rockets
---
Isn't there an NSFW warning...? If you didn't have to  you would have already enabled it,  meaning you've already experienced it
---
Its from lex i dont trust this
---
Maybe. But we do not know exactly what will happen tomorrow.
---
r/cursedbrawlstars
---
[removed]
---
Honestly if they can give Bo's current star power to Mortis it will be helpful
---
Well oiled might refer to Gens‚Äôs lamp?
---
Look at my Edits
---
Thx!
---
We will see üòÖ
---
It's mythic it's gonna be hard
---
Makes no sense for them to replace every SP with new ones, especially since they just reworked one for Penny.
---
the new brawler ?
---
Yeah, I know...
---
On Twitter I guess ? Idk so if im wrong plz don't blame me
---
No u
---
Same thing in showdown, it isn't fair for those who spawn in the upper part, because you actually have 1 tile more view to up than to down
---
Ik , I didn't say anything about super range
---
No, I don't agree with the Siege token change. Yes, it takes a lot of effort to get a Star Token, but it is still one event, I honestly feel like people are exaggerating the Siege lost streak. Yes it happens some time, but you also get double the trophies, so it's fair.
---
I save the gems only for this offer, but now idk if still whorth. Between 3 or 4 weeks appears
---
It‚Äôs funny how people realised the colours correspond to the rarity of the brawlers before YouTubers, even though they had access to the sneak peek a day before.
---
I have faith in kairos the over-analyser though‚ú®
---
Brock is way better than Piper it isn‚Äôt super easy to hit those.
---
Why are some darker than the rest? More powerful?
---
Idk. Maybe waiting in the bushes? He is useless in that map
---
20 hours left
---
I guess youtube did an opsie.
---
i see you're man of culture as well
---
Dude you‚Äôre smartüòÇ
---
Yeah maybe that's possible as well
---
HAMBURGER
---
Don't forget wkwk land üòÇ well we are in same country üòÇ
---
The super diameter is 8, and you just said that it is 9,67 and you decreased it to 8.33
---
Careful he's a hero
---
Oh yeah I'm blind, somehow I didn't notice they won lol
---
hes very weak against piper and brock because hes low health and slow movement speed he gets taken out very fast
---
if he gets this ability he can counters that
---
Well oiled could be gene because he have a lamp
---
I think well oiled goes to Mortis's lamp and increases range seen in bushes.
---
I read that like ‚Äúseason four spike‚Äù and I thought about a flipping Netflix series‚Äôs. What‚Äôs spike gonna do on tv?
---
you dont see , it is bibi
---
Looks like the new video points to it being a mythic brawler. So you might be right!
---
Wait... I wrote that on accident.....
---
Maybe alternative star Powers?
---
Crow in solos
---
Poco in gem grab with friends
---
Dynamike in bounty, heist and duos with a friend
---
Dude im brock main for 4 months and when i play with piper i see that piper is much stronger and when i want to use my super as brock it takes while to my rockets hit ground and this make it easy to dodge.
---
Tara's one is Healing shade, the Italian translation is TARApeuta so it's obvious
---
wrong again sadly, a leak was found, if you want, i can send the image to you, but it is a snake looking brawler. Mortis takes the Healing Shade as Tara Takes Well Oiled, due to their black hole being, oiled.
---
im trying to make something on his hand but i dont now what to do.You have some sugestion?
---
Wtf is that guy
---
hahaha how is this a thing
---
Clusterbombdude!
---
It should be no but actually yes
---
Nah Sholt is best, Molt can go succ a scp 173.
---
did not even blot out the subtitles that created this skin gedi-kor xd
---
No we dont know theyre defualt syat power yet. This would be their alternate.
---
You keep in mind the rarity's.
---
Omg imagine Reinhardt-like super for Bull
---
You sir are right
---
One day I was faking getting Leon, I had edited a video to make it look like I got him. And my friend opens ONE small box and the first brawler he gets is LEON. I was only faking getting him because I wanted him so bad. And my friend who was the same trophy level as me got two mythics in one big box. I'm still stuck at 16 brawlers, 3 of which I bought with gems.
---
I guess tomorrow then
---
If you want to make him holding something, then I guess his shotguns. If you want to do something different though, I guess maybe a model ship if you want something more difficult, or a wooden pint cup, or even just a wrench.
---
Okay, please do send the leak to me!
---
What's this supposed to be?
---
Removed. Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. Additionally do not use low effort/all caps/clickbait titles.

Made from recycled materials.
---
Balls... Dunno that the Super Rare Brawlers have them
---
Low effort memes.
---
oki, so everyone is saying tara and mortis should be swapped, i think all mythics beside gene should be. Well Oiled relates to tara's black hole, and healing shade would either be the new brawler, unlikely as we already have multiple healers, or an ability for mortis.
---
Well yes

Draw it

Less damage when super
---
What the fuck? A Nerf?
---
It‚Äôs a g. But I see what you were thinking lol
---
The only thing I wish for is for these new star powers to be at level 5 or so, i mean, im at 5k trophies and haven¬¥t got any single star power, so it would be cool being able to unlock them easier.
---
probably
---
Maybe it's the upcoming brawl talk wich comes tomorrow
---
So, new brawler will be Mythic?
---
Well Oiled is for Gene. Because he's got that lantern, and it needs oil. I guess.
---
btw Tara &amp; Mortis are the other way around imo.
---
Band aid is def poco
---
Haah
---
Guys check my version on the youtube video. You will find it, it is on top.
---
Too bad, that guy stole that quote from a post from here.
---
Mortis has stolen 100
---
You are right, I will never jave a clue how that felt because I never had a brawler to 500
---
Which you used to talk with Frank?
---
what's the leak?
---
sounds like a mech type of brawler
---
Sorry. I'll try to make future posts more original
---
I gonna try make he holding a phone
---
Well sorry, that is the first meme I‚Äôve ever made
---
Stfu
---
He's been camping so long he forgot to walk
---
''Dynamike will be able to destroy cover with his main attack''
---
Oh hell no
---
Bojitiful is beautiful
---
Robo retreat can refer to how darryl retreats into his barrel in his losing animation
---
Nice. I came to the same conclusion earlier. Only thing is change is balls of fire is Penny, Robo Retreat is Rico, and Protective Pirouette to Carl. Retreating is something a squishy brawler like Rico would do. Pirouette is a spin, and Carl spins with his super. So that leaves the fiery balls to Penny's cannon.
---
Why nerf barleys starpower
---
If it's not clear that's a Shelly.
---
 \- Teamers
---
You hit the walls and they break
---
I‚Äôm ready to serve.
---
Maybe Frank deals more damage depending on how much he takes, like a sponge that soaks up water and when you squeeze it it returns some of the water
---
Yeah but that's because we already know their first star power
---
Robo Retreat for Carl Has to Be Right :C You Escape wif Super.
---
And...
---
Mostly Females do Pirouettes.
---
Ryan gave hearths here and there.
---
Rosa gloves will probably inflict bleed
---
thank you for the oversized circle and arrow, wasn‚Äôt sure what I was going to look at if it wasn‚Äôt for you
---
Quality shit right here but I disagree with a few things. 2x star tokens on siege doesn‚Äôt make sense and will never happen. Pennys mortar doesn‚Äôt need a hp nerf. It‚Äôs just not necessary. Pennys sp is overpowered, not the mortar itself. And barleys star power isn‚Äôt what makes him powerful. It‚Äôs the control that he gives. If you were to nerf barley, you‚Äôd have to touch on the range or radius of his regular attack/super
---
Bruh

The bug penny celebrate victory but she lost the game üòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Where?
---
Penny's turret fires Cannon balls
---
That smile tho
---
A basketball coach.
---
I am gonna make a post!
---
It will explain what each star power will do and which brawler will have it! (I'm only guessing)
---
Bruh saveing gems is best
---
*himself*
---
 
---
.
---
Like Corki from League of Sexual Harassment.
---
O sh*t!
---
if\*
---
Yea I‚Äôd like the idea of a new thrower, and the new brawler is a female so yea, I‚Äôm thinking we need a male next time
---
It's a shit meme deal with it
---
They are celebrating to be in brawl tv so they are doing the cha-cha dance
---
This is underrated and yes I am Teodor Ivonaru
---
Sorry, but I gotta untilt my Shelly
---
But that's a skin, not the main character
---
Then why‚Äôd you make it
---
I think it's a Tara skin with a star power
---
Fake
---
Calling the mods like that isn't going to help.
---
fair enough, but just thinking about it without colour u see....
---
Yes i agree, we will soon find outt in brawl talk ;)
---
But how do you even know these people exist?
---
That‚Äôs a large bibi nerf. Woah there. 1 to 2/3 radius is a lot.
---
kill it with fire (please tell me that isnt tara)
---
Because instead of nerfing Penny's star power they accidentally nerfed token doublers
---
*BTD6 insentifies*
---
Curbeball is for rico i think
---
Wow the titles colors indicate the rarity damn how i not realize that
---
Whoa,This is going to be awesome
---
It‚Äôs tomorrow!
---
Coach Cory's was the most accurate in my opinion
---
4 Rares, 4 Super Rares, 4 Epics, 3 Mythics, so yeah, could be.
---
No, they are both pushing and because they know each other they don't want that the other one has to lose
---
Penny doesn't approve
---
WHY DOES EVERYONE HAS THE SAME IDEAS AS ME
---
üßê
---
It would be weird to have more legendaries than lower rarities..
---
dm me too
---
Looks extremely good, well done!
---
If i wasnt poor,you would have gold right now
---
Because that's his wallpaper
---
Lvl 5: Copying from the answer sheet after the test
---
Go see now
---
I think that robo retreat is rico's
---
Pirouette is Carl's
---
And balls of fire Penny's
---
INVISIHEAL BOIS
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure Tara and El Primo are getting remodels soon so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if that was Tara‚Äôs remodel.
---
We put in our Reddit Username in this so they will use it.
---
men understand this

Mortis can now 3-shot me, I didn‚Äôt ‚Äònerf‚Äô Mortis on purpose, I just made a mistake.
---
r/UnexpectedJoJo
---
Himself and himself unlock himself
---
Please do it
---
1. Maybe
---
2. Then her super should be a lot weaker
---
3. No.
---
Kinda glossed over it, so I had a look at it. It‚Äôs still very good!
---
yOrHA bibi
---
No it‚Äôs just a skin fam
---
mom?
---
Mortis kills dina in 4-Shots ok he stay more fast now, but no is OP and 3-Shots beucause the level of your dina.
---
Thanks for the 8000th karma :p.
---
GorƒÖco zapraszam!
---
rico new starpower leak 2016
---
U did not even use the star power there so it would help
---
Me:visible confusion
---
But ok balance changes is hard.
---
Sick!
---
That bibi carried them
---
How you got it?
---
So you just injure me with your poor french
---
I agree yeah, she should deal less damage but the reload speed would be worth.
---
Also when I say exact duplicate,I'd be fine if it didn't throw cards, but I would like it to at least have similar health and scaled with power cubes like legit every other spawnable
---
The new brawler will be mythic. It‚Äôs the second star power which is well oiled. Most likely a robot or hoverboarder as was alluded to months ago
---
Colt maybe?
---
id riot. alone.
---
Lol bruce
---
I think you're right
---
No, I buffed Mortis so that he 3 shots Mike: 3920/3=1307
---
Woah
---
Ooh, maybe he can pull his allies then. Get ready for some mad trolling!
---
Sssshhhhhhhh (he is my Irl friend)
---
Youtubers don‚Äôt realize it is colored coded
---
Spin land
---
I think because no team wants to showed as loser in tv royal
---
Haha, like Frank's stun
---
Ryan is russian?? Im confused. :(
---
Thorny gloves - Enemies get small damage when hitting Rosa with her super
---
It's funny to see Leon taking the bait in the end. Nice plays
---
Yes but the hitpoint makes he more fragile. And scare the players to go close of enemy.
---
photoshop
---
Broken carl
---
*why do people call them ult smh*
---
You got a good point
---
Jessie. I like how you can defend against a whole team with her. Fighting next to your turret and chaining auto-attacks. You can use your turret in the chain and heal it up.
---
I also like Shelly Piper. The ladies are much cooler in game i don't know why
---
How many trophies are you at
---
stonks*
---
The idea is great but I mean that it would make Tara very sp-dependent.
---
Is that actually legit
---
Yes, I agree it's probably well oiled
---
I don't know
---
She already is though.
---

i love how the colord relate to the different rarity levels

Mortis : where is my hat

Nita, Im guessing you are saying when Nita's bear gets killed Nita gets faster? But if Nita gets faster you'd isn't specify a time. A faster bear will also be annoying but it is still possible Anyways

My guess is that he went to Russia for recording brawl talk,since it's a year of release in Russia,on Android(not global tho)
---
And also total trolls
---
Yes but mobility is el primo.  Bull. Crow. Piper
---
Looks like thrower‚Äîspawner type brawler.
---
I'm sorry they are not very off they are just weird
---
I'm hyped AF because recently I unlocked Darryl's Star Power lol
---
We should unlock the first star power in level 8 and second star power in level 9
---
Now it‚Äôs confirmed that Brawl Talk is coming tomorrow, so it‚Äôs not just my words...
---
Sponge is op
---
-brock
---
Ok. I am Latvian
---
#*stonks**
---
you wanna fight?
---
Oh, no. I meant when the bear or Nita gets a kill, the bear gains a small speed increase. It could gain multiple of them, but it would reset when the bear was killed or a new bear was summoned
---
Why is this comment hated?
---
It's a youtuber's clan.Made by ICEARROW.They love playing with frank and have this tag in their name [–ë–õ–≠–¢].
---
I don‚Äôt know, I feel like gene‚Äôs is the Well Oiled one because genies usually come out of oil lamps but it‚Äôs my guess
---
What is this post?

she is fine as is i believe. she needs an epic mechanic (knockback) and her stats are alright imo.
---
Dm me too

I just messed up, I‚Äôll try to improve next balance changes, I love thinking about this balancing stuff so the feedback helps me, it doesn‚Äôt make me mad, don‚Äôt worry.

Is he still the strongets in my opinion. His mechanics are like Rosas just strong.
---
This has already been confirmed by coach Cory. The YouTubers probably knew beforehand, seeing that all three of them (Cory, kairos, and Rey) ‚Äúasked‚Äù for extra star powers
---
Alternate Star Powers; you're probably gonna be able to switch between Star Powers
---
Sneaky peaky like
---
Supercell needs more money, and getting it from skins that dont give advantages in the game is better than putting new content behind a paywall, right?
---
I predicted it!!!
---
Bo just said, ‚ÄúSike you thought.‚Äù
---
Despite his low health, Spike is pretty strong at dealing with both long and short ranged brawlers.
---
-Use his spikes to peak shot enemies behind walls.
---
-Learn to dodge. His low health makes him super vulnerable to sharpshooters like piper.
---
-Spike can deal up to 2000 damage per shot if he  manages to hit an enemy with his cactus ball. Try to use that at enemies charging towards you.
---
-Use your super before your normal attack. If you can get close to an enemy and unload all 3 of your attacks on them, you can deal more than 5000 damage. That‚Äôs huge!
---
Super would be yellow.
---
I got a nice revenge dub. But I wasn‚Äôt able to show replays even though I was able to earlier...
---
What if an enemy was coming?
---
My thoughts exactly.... why‚Äôd they knock it down from 1k?
---
I don't think you used the template correctly... why did the boss kick him out if "shockey" was the one who was selected to be the name?
---
A bit of luck and patience 
---
Or just pay everything its gonna take less than a day
---
i never thought the leak would be that old, it was back 2018? i've just known about it a few days ago
---
Well, duh.
---
üëÄüëÅ

How could this be a tara remode? It looks entirely different and this one is a thrower!
---
He still looks like himself u should‚Äôve atleast made him a little different with wires coming out of him and electricity not bad tho
---
Piper shoots herself

If you don‚Äôt have a visual or aesthetic device to demonstrate this then your concept will never reach top page. That‚Äôs just how the sub works. Children like colorful things

That's my comment on someone else's post who's username you can clearly see, dummy.
---
Yes that one creeps me out!
---
I would be very disappointed
---
if you think bout it , is says that a mega box is worth 10 small boxes, the offer is for 49, now this is 9 small boxes, worth 29... think it is still a heck of a deal
---
Speed buff/nerf is a most tricky to put
---
+0.1 is making it slower 
---
-0.1 is making it faster
---
But ppl thinks + is buff and - is nerf
---
I think Mortis will be coiled snake and will have a bar similar to bibi and when he has all attacks and the bar is charged his next attack has a much larger distance and maybe more damage. And Tara‚Äôs would be healing shade and would have some sort of healing with her super where it be teammates standing in it or spawning a second shadow with some sort of healing ability.

In my opinion get the BS pack, cause like how are emotes gonna help you progress in CR, but this will help you get a headstart, also next time connect your account with Supercell ID so u don't lose your progress.

Isn‚Äôt that pretty bad?
---
Join his club and report him, it aint much but it's honest work...
---
I just wish he damages himself when he attacks
---
I don't think it will be gane chnaging
---
I think so. Maybe he sponges up damage while charging and deals it back with his super? That would be insanely OP if played at the right time.
---
I also
---
I think that darryl‚Äôs star power makes his super charge faster
---
This is the second time you did that to me
---
Shut up boomer
---
Yup
---
It's just 4 rockets not a game changer it's like having reload speed he should've had had 4 rockets in the first place doesn't make sense
---
Well Oiled is Gene bc you oil lamps, the Healing Shadow is Tara bc it's a shadow, and Protectuve Parouette is Cark bc he spins.
---
happy cake day
---
How dare you to play no hat Mortis
---
You should add a few more distinct details that makes it looks like a radon. Right now it just like a recolor, but NO hatrid, it looks great.
---
The hat slows me down
---
It is I! Racoon!(Tome)
---
Well Oiled is Gene bc you oil lamps
---
#LMAO

&gt;Where's my 10th brawl box supercell?

Gone. Reduced to atoms.

That's funny üòÇ

Let us not forget Mortis Nerfs

Yeah

1st time posting. Don't be harsh pls :P
---
Me react new update..... -_-

Nice again
---
It do be like that tho
---
(LAUGHS IN AMERICAN)
---
Imagine receiving this as a kidnapper letter.
---
Please no...
---
At least this is not a win trade, but it's fucking draw trade
---
True but if you‚Äôre a beta player you can be F2P and maxed out which is crazy for a supercell game. Plus you get around 150 boxes a month so the additional brawler each month can be maxed out right away for a F2P account
---
It's gonna be useful.
---
get in the van if you want to see Dani again
---
He will heal when he turns invis tho.
---
It should be condoms ten times more funy
---
Poor Frank.

If you look down the text box, you can see a button that is a B and an i, the B is for bold text **like this** and the i is *like this*
---
It has the humour flair.
---
It remains to determine what will the star power be. I predict its going to be "well oiled" or something like that.

Well I usually play Poco, sometimes as a gem carrier, sometimes as a assist for damages (mostly to charge my super) and sometimes to finish low hp enemies
---
Where are you from I‚Äôm sorry but I really don‚Äôt understand your english you should write it down, thank you for the information tho
---
Welcome to eye of the storm. Where if you‚Äôre not shelly or bull, you have no chance to push trophies. It‚Äôs a horrific map.

Yeah, they played bull, Leon and crow

Agreed

wehre is remodel

Dude this is the best Rico skin I've ever seen

Just remember if you see p at the end don't click

Gene still has a floating Oil Lamp beside him. Gene is still based of a Genie, even if he's called otherwise.

Have you even watched his video? He said he got to see the video before everyone else, but he never said he got any other information.
---
And if what you say is true, then his entire video was a troll which Kairos NEVER done before, and he will be hated for that troll, because the video seemed serious.
---
If you havent watched his video, you shouldnt comment on my post due to obvious reasons.

Best way to balance an op brawler, make her fight herself
---
Yes I love it, it's the multi mortar from clash of clans
---
Yea this would really help brawl Stars as a game with keeping players intrigued.
---
Tara skin
---
That‚Äôs all I play when I Nita
---
The whole thing with Shelly is that she can‚Äôt easily get to close range. She has no dash or mobility, so she relies heavily on bushes. It‚Äôs very simple and worth your while to spend one or two ammo bars checking a bush. She is actually one of the weakest brawlers in the game.
---
New brawler, new quality of life, new skins
---
Yess
---
r/shittybrawlstars
---
Mortis and Tara should be changed because of alternate translations. Well oiled is probably the new brawler
---
Darryl: Darryl is my name, rolling is my Game

Tara: Tara is my name, throwing cards is my Game

Bibi: Bibi is my name, swinging my bat is my Game

Leon: Leon is my name, invisibility is my Game

Spike: Spike is my name, throwing cacti is my game

Talks about balance, while plays at barely 300 trophies

Which also doesnt one shot snyone with like 10 powerup bulls

Just because it's a good shotgunner map doesn't mean it's OP

Just for the meme would make it awesome

It's an anime thing. Guys who look like girls. Get it? A trap

"Humor"
---
Looks awesome
---
Me thinking that if this was real Leon will not be in the galar region
---
True, but duplicate brawlers aren‚Äôt allowed, so it‚Äôs different El Primos joining together to lose all the gems they can find.
---
ü¶á
---
Damn right
---
Either they just teamed or there‚Äôs a glitch where you can get up to I think 5 people on the same team in showdown.
---
For a moment it for me it looked like nita killed her bear and that was the skin.
---
I'm apparently a very dark person
---
lol yeah for you it‚Äôll be 12:00 pm I think

Clever af
---
Your crow is try to conceal his anger
---
They dont ever tell us the 1st star power.....
---
Hmmm different takes from what I've seen
---
I spend the daaaay waaaay
---
This is Shelly‚Äôs new star power
---
Yea i hate philip he has alm legendaries but i only have spike even thou we started playin on the same day. Actually that on a newer account on my main tho that started on the same day as him i dont have a legend
---
Fantastic move.
---
but we are getting VO and skins for Tara and Leon...
---
Oh really?
---
Oh god,f**k me,I never thought of the Pam's new one of that way! Genius!
---
why do you steal content
---
no
---
Sorry, should have been more clear but I think he helped make it.
---
:BiBi: what does that mean
---
most brawl tubers heart the newest commenrt. Nor imprasive.
---
Sleeping, you‚Äôre on your tippy toes
---
how do you get that CUSTOM BRAWLER BESIDES YOUR NAME
---
I am scared what ifI can‚Äôt even get a star power when others already get an OP one
---
K cool
---
No ! Darrly Rolls

    Must be for some man who actually has balls

I've seen 10 Primo-with-10-gems posts on ny way down here and you choose to link it here.
---
They could have 2 star powers but you can only use one at a time so the new brawler would just have 1 star power and in the next update it will get another one
---
If youre good you can just walk up to enemies juking their shott
---
Ok
---
true.
---
Your Mom must be so proud of you, such a mature human being

no shelly is fine

Dude, first off, my post is different from u/Sector03 's post. He said Carl's, Penny's and Rico's Star Powers are Robo Retreat, Protective Pirouette, and Balls of Fire respectively. I said They were Protective Pirouette, Balls of Fire and Robo Retreat respectively. 
---
Second off, I SAID I didn't repost Sector's post IN THE FRICKING TITLE AND THR FRICKING COMMENTS.
---
next time please üëÄ harder before you call someone out, okay?
---
Yes You TOUGH GUY
---
if there is just one more ammo slot i think that would be fine. it would improve your burst but not how often you can shoot rockets or anything like that.

It might be, and if it is I‚Äôll assure you I won‚Äôt cry over itüåà

I can‚Äôt speak to clash royale because I don‚Äôt play it...but think about it this way. In boom beach or coc, most people only battle once or twice and then they‚Äôre done for a while because armies have to be trained. In brawl stars, you can battle constantly. It‚Äôs also live combat which puts more strain on the servers(lag is still a serious problem). The number of replays being saved and replayed would be massive if everyone had access to them. I‚Äôd rather they make the servers more stable and fix lag and disconnect issues before people get access to replays at low levels. Does this suck for lower ranked brawlers? Yeah. Of course. But it shouldn‚Äôt be a priority right now.
---
Bones need milk; so poco had too much milk
---
Yes yes yes!
---
Hmmm... maybe supercell is giving us weaker star powers that u can get earlier on, but have the lvl 10 ones more powerful. From that, I would say supercell wants this star power to be a surprise.
---
Best is root
---
I think that star power has to do with Tara. People have been saying buff Tara and to give her a remodel, they might have done all of that but plus a new start power. This could definitely be a possibility though.
---
Regular emotes would have a 10 second recharge time
---
                                                                         XD
---
Yes, it's like the most wide open map on in the game except maybe dry season
---
Zoomed in a no its not a new brawler lex is trolling
