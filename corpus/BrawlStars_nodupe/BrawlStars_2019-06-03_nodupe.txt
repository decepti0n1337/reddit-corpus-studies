Congratulations! You have successfully found one of many, many inconsistencies in the mobile game known as Brawl Stars! (Ôæâ‚óï„ÉÆ‚óï)Ôæâ\*:ÔΩ•Ôæü‚úß
---
Damn Etika really has lost himself recently
---
Thank you! The time it took is defenitely worth it!
---
Yes, a close, personal friend
---
Where is him? :)
---
The leon somehow doesn't have his super yetüòÇ
---
U forgot the hat but still upvoting
---
Ha, Thanks!
---
Why are you telling me that? He was still the easiest to kill
---
tilaajaa
---
She doesn't look buffed at all. You know what buffed means or you're just trolling my post?
---
That would be a great map
---
At least you didn‚Äôt lose any trophies
---
Thank you
---
Aren't PEKKA's females?
---
Thanks so much!
---
Awesome!
---
P.s. I don't know how I forgot the hat!
---
That guy: SOMEONE MUST BE IN DA BUSH (Typical random)
---
Well u can already do that with bushes or The Star power u posted
---
Thanks for using it! :D
---
Your art is spectacular!
---
Damn... Poco's leg is fucked up
---
stop!theif!
---
YeahüòÇ It curved a little bit
---
Original.. yeah
---
Ohh if u look videos before global update, it is too easy: tap the ready button and brawler at the same time.
---
Clean them up they are delicious... Teamers are always Leon‚Äôs food
---
I don't know man. I was trying to draw a new pose and I thought it was a great idea to draw Penny in a normal human size dynamically (by dynamically I mean miving towards a the camera or from the camera).
---

---
Yes the thighs on the right side is big because I inteded to maks it closer to the camera. This my first time drawing like this and I didn't get it right at all. I messed it up. It hurts that I put too much work then the whole thing is ruined.
---
why does this have upvotes , it is literally stolen.
---
That would be a good skin
---
Absolutely fantastic
---
It's just discussion.  Looks like blue team might have a slight advantage as they can get cover in the side bushes quicker.  I'm not saying you did a bad job or anything.  No offense intended.  Looks like you could just swap the jump pads on one of the sides to make symmetrical.
---
Again, I don't think it's a bad map.  I quite like it and that's why I'm interested in discussing it.  Nice map
---
Copyright
---
I see people named ‚Äúangel pro‚Äù or ‚Äúel pro‚Äù all the time
---
Thx
---
How the hell does this get 2k upvotes lmao
---
It's to prevent people from quitting midgame and getting rewarded for doing so. It sucks, but it's a good system.
---
Where is this video from and why is it so bad it's good
---
Pam is Colt‚Äòs mom. He is also Jessie‚Äòs dad üòè
---
thats... impressive.... good job!
---
My god
---
Now THIS is a good meme.
---
Yes but it is very weird, at least to me. It is like the night witch mortis skin
---
Hi Pekka
---
üòÇ
---
I think poco could be higher me and my friend have a really good duo showdown with poco and crow
---
Goodbye jojooo!!!
---
This makes me think it would be hilarious for Darryl to have a passive that while he‚Äôs standing still he looks like a normal barrel to enemies.
---
Not feasible at all, but hilarious to imagine
---
She's still a top 2 brawler. You have no idea what you're talking about.
---
You're the one to talk.
---
I think darryl should be one tier above, he star power is amazing.
---
You never expect the bubble to hit you again until it bounces off a wall
---
Poco Is Amazing in Team Battles I Understand
---
He just gets outclassed most of the time and his damage doesnt help that much
---
Trophy count?(just curious)
---
Yeah. It even works for tara's shadow if you can time it
---
He does
---
No
---
10k, not even a mythic. 5k is nothing, stop complaining.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/bvyfe8/shellys_super_be_like/

Can you make it like this üòÇ but change the bullets to something else, like water or grapes(?)
---
is it bad that this is the first time something on r/Brawlstars that made me laugh
---
Lmao
---
Lay down the dynamikes man, you're gonna have dynabetes.
---
Yeet
---
Yo this re-poster about to get naturally selected by other redditors
---
Someone else has 400 trophies. Allowing you to replay the game
---
Why are people down voting this? Is there something you need me to improve or something?
---
Wait there was a second need
---
How to make showdown fair again:remove shelly from the game
---
the new starting brawler will be colt
---
Poco is a c  in my opinion. But good list
---
Don't. There's no stopping it now, and plus it was a good idea.
---
If I did that, I'd be downvoted into oblivion.
---
You are famous now lol
---
 tara  ( lucky card )  : each third ammo used the next attack  the three cards will glow they are  three colors  ; red : deals more damage blue ; slows the target black ( its a new effect i call it silence ) the enemy hit can t cast a normal attack or a super but can move ) or tara can switch her positining with her shadow its called shadow swap since the shadow is super fast but fragile this can help tara
---
God damn, I have every Brawler and I've spend probably less than $80 on this game.
---
i love this
---
double comment
---
But he also has them almost all maxed and has all the expensive skins
---

Gene:

Pffft. Weak
---
Looks kinda cool
---
being overleveled and then barely winning isn't clutch
---
What did he throw down in that hole? That was not what I was expecting!
---
ESPECIALLY true in Twist &amp; Shoot
---
Bo's old skin looks special
---
My friend doesn‚Äôt even have 2000 trophies and he has every brawler( obviously no dynamike and bo)
---
 And I‚Äôm jealous because I‚Äôm at nearly 3200 trophies and I don‚Äôt even have a mythic
---
I have updated my map and will upload it on reddit about 1 hour later

Give them to OGs for free

I agree
---
if she gets a voice line i want it to be quiet and mysterious, and one of her death lines to be ‚ÄúOh, come on.‚Äù
---
Hey that's actually true
---
I'm one of them
---
nita ( i got two ideas ) first one is nita s forth attack will stun the enemy for a little bit of time and when she s about the use the fourth attack ( that will stun ) but instead she throws out her bear ; the bear will stun all nearby enemies within a large area . the second one is whenever nitas dies and her bear is still alive he ll become furious and he will have a large mouvement speed and attack speed and damage but his health will decay overtime kinda fast and whene bears dies ( i dunno but thanks for reading )
---
Ah alright yeah I haven‚Äôt visited recently so not too sure of the meta there

Permission to use?
---
Did I post at the wrong time?
---
That sound is comical
---
Agreed
---
I think you don't get how to make comparisons. To compare fairly two things, they must be similar.
---
CR isn't as fast as BS, and the gameplay is "easier" as it is tapping the screen, so that means sending emotes and watching them is easy, while in BS there is constant action as the gameplay recquires both joysticks constantly moving, so the gameplay is fast and you would barely have time to send emotes
---
Now, talking about voice chat, the difference is BS (like I said) is fast. The game is designed so you can play quick matches of less than 3 minutes, unless other games with longer duration. Also, the game is focusing in being casual, ideal for playing 3 or 4 quick matches and leaving, so their prioritie isn't a voice chat.
---
Maybe in the future (a far future) when a large part of the community is higher in trophies and a casual game isn't their prioritie, they could add some way of comunication, but not at the moment
---
Btw, sorry if I was rude at the beginning. I didn't mean it, and I think we can have a nice talk about your idea
---
How will they make money? P2w makes them rich.
---
Or maybe a death line could be ‚Äúfold‚Äù or ‚Äúi bust‚Äù
---
Report that thief
---
First time hearing it and yes it is!!!
---
Remember that when they kill the defenders, the towers are easy to attack, like a Heist cage, and tyou can broke the Heist cage in 30 seconds. Thats why I put so muchas health in the towers.
---
But thanks for sharing your idea!
---
W√°ooii
---
Don't go randoms then. There are plenty of active clubs from reddit
---
I guess I got lucky. It's all RNG after all.
---
I know how to stop teaming: delete walls in every map
---
Did it?
---
r/LeonGang
---
Drag queen confirmed
---
And I put 3 minutes because in 5 minutes the attackers have time to destroy the three towers and have 10 minutes more. The idea is make this game hard to finish with a perfect.
---
No it needs to look like I‚Äôm a tryhard üòÇ
---
Holy shit, that could kill a kid as small as him
---
Yes, zzkippzz is great man
---
I think Barley is better cause the ulti but tes the throwers
---
are OP
---
Yes you can! Only have to give credits.
---
Why does so many hate this great map
---
I can almost guarantee that her voice lines are going to sound like some middle-aged bootleg Walmart fortune teller wannabe trying to pass off a snow globe as a crystal ball.
---
Its so toxic
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that was someone else‚Äôs
---
The reason of the boxes is to open them
---
That‚Äôs reddit for you, everyone steals from everyone
---
Don't steal other people's ideas you fuck
---
Brock has new projectiles
---
DONT TALK SHIT ABOUT FRESH
---
says the primo
---
Honestly, I'm actually okay with seeing the combos, since I'm subbed to a lot of other subreddits, it doesn't clutter up
---
Wow NO ONE CARES
---
F for the kid
---
An accurate display of my brawlers health and trophies
---
r/whoosh
---
If brawler has different attack animation with skin, then it costs 80 or 150 gems usually
---
i dont get it? werent you meant to put a picture of a legendary in the meme?
---
Delete
---
U #GeneGang too?
---
This map is so beautiful!!!
---
You really reposted this crap
---
Reeepost
---
Bug imao
---
THIEF! BOOOOOOOOOO!
---
That‚Äôs not exactly what I mean. The enemies have a gene that heals all of them for 200 per sec. on top of that, poco can attack his teammates to heal themselves up. So literally, If I did any damage to any of them, they healed it back up in a jiffy.
---
REPOST FOR GOD SAKE, STOP THIS
---
Why are you complaining. I don't mean to be rude but 4k is nothing
---
Keep  posting
---
I too took a screenshot of it to post on the sub but you did it.
---
I dint have penny at 6000
---
Ignore the question in the title please...
---
Wow ok creep
---
This is a cool idea!
---
This subreddit is for Brawl Stars
---
So just deal with it. You are not good random.
---
ThanksüòÇüåù
---
NO ONE CARES!! WOW
---
I am.
---
From who?
---
Great editing
---
you got the worst mythic and legendary, feel bad for you
---
Clearly does. Teaming in showdown and camping in a bush doesn‚Äôt make you good.
---
I think they are a real team not randoms and the game is adjusted to the player with the most trophies.
---
sorry i dont like it
---
How do you spam "buff crow" as a meme?
---
'i have created it' lmao not suspicious at all
---
I think you're right, but agree that this isn't normal
---
LoL this is my post
---
I mean screen shot the life leech logo And post it
---
LOL
---
Wow you are lucky
---
XD
---
You made me forcefully blow air through my nose
---
How is carl robo?
---
You think I care? Bruh I have 10k karma I have nothing to lose. I dont care lol why would anyone actually care about that. Minding my own bussines and expressing my own opinion.
---
i absolutely love your art(not really you rippoffer)
---
Cool? You never answered on where you got the fact that I wanted a ‚Äúbuff‚Äù
---
You fell victim to one of the classic blunders!
---
Yeah i was pushing carl from 362 to 427 trophies cuz of this map
---
Never mind, just saw that you can see it when tapping on "claim'
---
&gt;!I didn't waste time doing it, did I?!&lt;
---
Well. He is my favorite brawler.

I got one for colt - 
---
Instead of just getting that little speed boost, you should be able to change the direction of where you aim your super while using it. For example, if a colt shoots at a Darryl, but the Darryl supers away, you can re - aim the rest of your super.
---
Everyone with a brain: doesn‚Äôt play mortis in solo showdown
---
Art theift
---
I was just ASKING if you want him to get a buff, why you toxic?
---
These are great star power ideas too!
---
sounds too barbaric
---
so you just spam this

Follow me i will post that meme template
---
0.0720%  
---
5500 trophies, missing only the 3 legendaries, can't complain !
---
replay t'was was lit
---
Randoms? You mean those guys who make you lose trophies because they suicide into the enemy team giving them free supers?
---
CoMiNg FrOm My MiNd.
---
RIP
---
 Yea Rubbing the kill in people‚Äôs face
---
Mortis
---
BECAUSE THERES NO TIME TO EXPLAIN!
---
Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if shelly gets high
---
I'd assume it would be a random one which was unlcoked, but personally I'd like it to be so that unlocking one means unlocking all of them.
---
I like playing Poco in some maps, because you are a literal support.
---
Poke someone down enough that someone else kills them, it's like Mortis but you don't win straight up fights and it's way worse.
---
I second this
---
Ok thanks
---
Nope, plants are living, just not our way of living. And they ‚Äúeat‚Äù sunlight so there‚Äôs that
---
You, have talentüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç

Psst... heres a hint: poco isnt for sd hes for 3v3 with a good team üëçüëç
---
someones must've been to sensitive
---
No problems
---
Frank will dominate
---
Ain‚Äôt nobody got time for dat!
---
Ftw have you seen kairos's v12 brawler tier list
---
Dynamike and mortis are both bad, but dyna is worse
---
It's 25%, not 2.5x lol
---
But on Penny's case, it's an absolute win!!
---
And if you want let me in template i will post it too
---
I should clarify that I am only referring to his viability in Showdown. I don't play any other game modes so I'm not sure how he performs otherwise. I didn't even say anything about Brawl Ball.
---
Ooooooooooooo
---
Are you Dumb-Dumb? He stole it
---
Meh
---
Plot twist:brawl stars gives you stress
---
It's been 34 days since I've last gotten a star power and I have token doublers always active.
---
0.19% 10.9k trophies no legendaries
---
More complexity is something that BS is dying for rn, and sacrificing a bit of f2p friendliness is a fair trade imo. And if they added something like this, Supercell would of course change the SP gaining system.
---
5840 trophies here, just unlocked Frank. Only missing the 3 legendaries + Bibi and Mortis
---
Where u find them?
---
Yeah definitely I would love that! Please do!
---
CaRL IshTh mY nAmE, gEoLiGY IsHtH mY gAME!

What's the thing with mortis and colt
---
IRU, GUESS WHO?üòÇ
---
Moron
---
F2p players like me will agree
---
It‚Äôs all based on chance, but mostly luck
---
Lol nice one.
---
He did it twice
---
What do i say now?
---
I like it. Could be trophy based to give incentive to push. 300 trophies first star, 500 second, 750 3rd or whatever numbers. Would be nice to add a little mystery to how brawlers fight by choosing 1 out of 2 or 1 out of 3 star powers
---
*presses F in Leon*
---
I like this one. It would help both low mobility and high mobility characters.
---
5:50 with randoms.
---
The funny thing is,even if he properly covered the watermarks,it wouldnt be possible for 1 person to make 13 drawings in less than 12 hours
---
In barley's bar,right?
---
If that happened to me i would've start punching my phone
---
**like yikes**
---
u/brawlstarsfred dont care abput me,just going to his profile.
---
I feel like itd make things more complicated. You an tell if an enemy has a star power because their shadow becomes the logo... But if there were multiple there'd have to be a way to distinguish it.
---
Whole game was like that
---
Amen!!!!!
---
FBI, OPEN UP!
---
Wheres bibi

please stop shaking the screen it hurts

Good
---
Hell 2 U
---
Here are some ideas that would hopefully be not too broken and help balance out certain brawlers weaknesses:
---
Primo super causes an earthquake effect in a small radius when he lands, which does damage/reduces speed
---
Piper: echolocation: at max range, shot reveals enemies within 1 tile (shot must travel full distance without hitting something)
---
Bull: spiked boots: increased resistance to knock back and slow down effects
---
Nita: one with nature: extra damage to enemies standing in bushes
---
Crow: life link: crows poison gains him some amount of health back each tick
---
Spike: photosynthesis: super charges faster/stat boost when not in a bush (or maybe when near water)
---
Shelly: Locked and loaded: projectile travels faster when ammo bar is full
---
Tara: clear mind: stat boost when health bar is full
---
Frank: extra tough: increased health when ammo bar is full
---
Rico: bounce back: bullets can bounce off enemies as if they were walls too
---
Colt: lucky 7: one extra bullet per attack
---
Penny: cheap shot: firing main attack at the turret makes its next shot come faster
---
Pam: toxic beacon: Pam saps at the strength of nearby opponents when her super is ready
---
Leon: ambush: first attack out of super can go through enemies
---
Dynamite: light the fuse: deal a small amount of damage to very nearby enemies when using main attack
---
Barley: at your service: teammates reload faster when hit by barley attack
---
Feel free to use it! I‚Äôll have a look at your channel
---
Almost impossible
---
Not as rare as spike god damnit
---
ƒ∞ like how in anomalies there is a crow that can talk, a living cactus, a spirit,a magic mummy and with them there is a ld with rocket launcher
---
Count me in Sargent
---
This is a weird question because i got my spike before frank, tara, mortis, gene and Rico.
---
I‚Äôm still missing Mortis and i still need Leon and Crow so.
---
Brock would be the friend of Colt or dad of colt
---
Thank you man!
---
These skins are awesome! The community should get Supercell to implement one of your skins as a reward! You deserve it!
---
It's because he is kitty in my head.. So adorableüòö
---
Nice Idea! And drawing.
---
r/unpopularopinion
---
You might get matched up with someone who doesn't speak your language and it just makes it easier for people to verbally abuse their teammates whenever they're raging. It needs a communication system, but mics ain't it, chief.
---
I think that crow and leon are just good right now
---
Finally new content!!! Great meme
---
He dint reposted,He says that he made HIMSELF.
---
Whoo take the L!
---
That happens to me very often..
---
Crow is extremely overpowered. I understand that he is a legendary but he has become too strong.
---
reporting is enough private
---
Incredible art,i apreciate it!
---
Take my upvote!
---
But for some reason its not to up but thats ok
---
And crow got buff because community wanted so
---
No too
---
He says mortis the mortal when he gets hurt because he realizes he can get hurt. But nice post
---
Beautiful skin supercell need to hire u
---
Upvoted without seeing..........totally awesome
---
Metropolis Bo
---
The heroes should be shark teeth.
---
I got to his account and down voted every post the has made . and I saw that it wasn't just you he stole content from many others including gedi_kor. Is there a way to report this dude
---
He probably likes downvotes...
---
Would love to see this in the game
---
Great gamemode!
---
Just saying I don‚Äôt agree. Friends of mine having crow believe the same thing. He needed a buff but that was too much.
---
Next üÖ±ucking level

Dudududu Dudududu Dudududu

Oh No Leon have a Blue Eye

If he just walked in, yes but if he's been in there for at least a few seconds, no

Yep. The super is devastating in 3v3 modes, where u pull an enemy towards ur whole team and u demolish it, leaving u with 2 teammates and only 2 enemies (3v2 in that case).
---
Why you still doing this
---
Is this supposed to be a "meme"? Well, first, is this supposed to be funny?
---
I only have YT not _YT and anyways I gotta get my channel noticed somehow and I think picking BrawlStats might have been the worst or best decision I have made idk
---
If Nita‚Äôs bear was that much of a stud he would kill everyone within the blink of an eye
---
Sincerely I never liked crow it s just that before the chances  of killing a crow by distance were pretty equal, crow still had the advantage but that‚Äôs logical. However now crow can ve killed only by up close, he is dominant to non ranged brawlers.
---
IiIiIi WaNt GoLdEn WiNd
---
Everyone is going to be r/woooosh ed
---
Very good edit compared to others :D
---
Yep. His super is devastating, being able to pull an enemy towards ur team and destroy him, leavibg your team with 3 people and the other team with 2. Also it can pull the gem carrier from the enemy team in gem grab.

Yes! In September I will have 12.

When you hit all of the middles in your super just right
---
Actually, brock have 3 shoots, 3 brawlers, *OOOH, YA GOT DESTROYED!*
---
Let them spoil. Cause EG is suck :))
---
? I didn't say r/woooosh bruh
---
In all this argument,I guess gene is not that crazy good as they are talking about,and that magic hand's range is too short to do anything u p against brawlers that have long range,and yeah talking about poke damage,why do people forget spike,spike has a crazy forward poke range of your aim is good,not only in front,but 6 different directions,still they say gene is better,spike is better than gene,I am talking about overall perspective,not competitive level and shits like that, majority of the game players are still at 8000-10000 or even lower,at that range or lets talk even more upwards in trophies,spike is still better than gene,god knows why coach Cory who is no coach in any respect and kairos time have placed gene so high up in their tier list,and yeah talking about mid range spike outclasses gene,if you pull a spike,he does a crazy damage up close,and in mid range spike can easily do the poke damage better than gene, madmoneyman23,I agree what you say,gene is fine....
---
Stolen
---
Oh I was making a joke since that last panel there but... um.... well... ah... okay then
---
Ok, sorry, I do tend to exagerrate.
---
They also all do this in solo showdown where it‚Äôs easy to get trophies.
---
If you guess what Brawler will be on my next Super Combo idea I will make YOUR IDEA INTO IMAGES!

(If you do not like the idea you do not really have to write mean/negative comments!)

Rosa: I‚Äôll copy Bull‚Äôs strategy, then get my super, kill the enemy and get my super again
---
Rico: T E A M W O R K F O R T H E W I N ! ! !
---
Darryl: ... (can‚Äôt speak and can‚Äôt think of a strategy because he‚Äôs a robot)
---
Penny: I‚Äôll bush camp, trick the teamers to get near from my bush, then burst one of them down, hopefully it wasn‚Äôt an El Primo or Frank though, but my Mortar will help
---
Piper: run away for me to hit my enemies with my maximum damage potential 
---
Pam: think of any ways to get close to enemies and rip them through
---
Frank: HAR HAR HAR (Get my super And it‚Äôs party time)
---
Bibi: **BLOWS BUBBLEGUM**
---
Mortis: TEAMING POLICE RISE UP!

---
Leon: SURPRISE YOU FOOLS!
---
ive gotten 32

&lt;ya nasty&gt;

Greeeeat

So queue with actual people you know then. 550 trophies is not even pro level, I've had a brawler at that range. You can't tell me what I can and can't respond to either.
---
Did you win that game?
---
Cool, mb I'll do strategy with them ü§£üòâ
---
Because it looks like a dog ate it and shat it back out.
---
ya

Are you sarcastic?
---
Look man, I know you‚Äôre angry and upset that he‚Äôs reposting your content and mocking you for it. But just look at his profile; he‚Äôs an obvious attention whore. Downvoting, calling him out, linking him to this post, etc. are giving him exactly what he wants. Best we could do is scroll past and ignore it
---
He Doesn‚Äôt have to be human. We have a literal cactus, a crow, and a genie. He has never been described as a robot and he doesn‚Äôt sound anything like the other robots.
---
i guess you will get spike and leon next üòé
---
The second one is pure cancer but I like the idea
---
LMAO this guy not even covering the watermark

 K√∂nnen Sie eine √ºbersetzte Version mit Google Translate ver√∂ffentlichen? Ich verwende derzeit Translate, um Sie zu verstehen und Ihnen zu schreiben
---
But is it under 1 that is what i want to know
---
Ok now you‚Äôre just trolling
---
Probably who knows,maybe if i said the arrow is not to up that means something.
---
Also who the heck downvoted my comment?r/wooosh?
---
Removed. Rule 3. No providing information on how to break Supercell Terms of Service.
---
Stub your toe pls
---
This is funny af
---
Lol idc
---
Nice all but needs moustache
---
Statistically yes it does because the more boxes you open the closer you are to your eventual statistical gaurentee of a new brawler besides luck value increasing
---
Ik dude
---
I will add you at some point :)
---
Stop stealing work kid
---
Proof that Colt is a f----t
---
just made it to some people that might've not noticed :P
---
Same. Was about to click downvote and then.. oh wait he credited.
---
You had to **THINK** to know that it was gedi-kor's?
---
legit, Supercell needs to add one of your skins, You spend time and dedication making these skins that the community just loves and yet supercell doesn't add it, Love the skin btw
---

yes
---
He forgot to change the name (BTW look at my name)
---
So much whining. I‚Äôm F2P at 12k. All brawlers. All power points collected except for Bibi. All brawlers at lvl 8-10 with half of my brawlers at lvl 10. This game is ridiculously F2P friendly compared to other games. Idiots just want this game to be brain dead give aways. How about you play this game for more than a month until you expect to be maxed out.
---
Could You join my group please crow?
---
I know hes so dumb
---
300 trophies with Rico: never show your face in front of enemies always make the enemies come to you
---
[sad shelly noise]
---
suppercell lmao
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been playing aggressively and I‚Äôve been getting killed a lot due to his low health. Thanks for the advice!
---
Very nice man, satisfying
---
this happened to me for loaded rico, it used to cost 30 gems now it costs 150
---
What?
---
well, maybe if it's unexpected, but the matchup is based on who shoots first (and bull has faster shot speed so he should shoot first) but if you get lucky and hit the shelly while checking the bush, you can still win
---
If tara was mythic...oh wait (r/brawlstarsP)
---
it's supercell not suppercell
---
Uganda Knuckles: wE sPiT oN tHeM
---
His super charges really fast, so don't have fear to use it
---
We need an army!!!

Sure thing. Just posted it on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/ByQoPMuAiQm/?igshid=1bcfjyovpciqh)
---
I was waiting a bit later to post it on other websites since it was so early when I posted this on reddit
---
I mean gedi kors name you can still see it there in the picture
---
So that's why i don't have a legendary at 7k
---
oh god i hope i wont need to get/buy the 2 other star powers
---
Bunny penny
---
Yep I guess so
---
In the top right corner
---
This is Brawl Stars at 500 trophies (they have no skill). Not even one of my good plays, just above 400 so I got the replay.
---
And the Gene as well.
---
Looks like penny
---
Word of advice from someone who is at 9.5K, after 3 losses take a break, go for a walk watch some TV then come back to it. Sometimes you need a break.
---
dynamike the explorer
---
Nice comeback
---
Pervert.
---
I only spin when they were teaming or looking to team
---
Sooo, lets all DM this pos and tell him to knock it off
---
Where's the bug? There's nothing wrong there
---
This song is doodoo
---
Good map Idea,love the cactus and Bush thing.But the outside of the pit there is so little space that barley could be op in this map.
---
not to worry my dude, we will try to get his karma to negative. its -2 rn
---
I have for over 3 days then coming back and still wont help
---
Dope

Night witch mortis is one of the most used skins
---
Shred isn‚Äôt a bich
---
AND THEY DONT STOP COMING AND THEY DONT STOP COMING
---
Press Y to shame
---
Says a dynamike probably spun your way up to 300
---
What was that crow doing lmao
---
dynamike: F*** you Mortis
---
Mortis:yea F*** you
---
Shelley with super
---
Shelly saves Dyna üò≠
---
This is a quality shitpost.
---
And no I got the last 75 of my 500 solo wins pushing mortis
---
You mean a buff? She‚Äôs one of the worst ranked brawlers in the game
---
The brock skin has x5 quality honestly I think hot rod brock is worth it
---
Very in character for his flair
---
Why Poco in solo showdown?
---
*laughs in mortis*
---
Fidget spinner, you can‚Äôt say anything
---
MORTIS
---
That‚Äôs balanced enough
---
üëåüëå
---
I love doing this with barley against dynamike in skull creek
---
upvote to protest
---
Yeah i just realized mortis actually do have elongated chin
---
This reminds me of the loud house, and lana. Great art!!!
---
Gene after he gets nerfed
---
I'm glad you like it! Brawl stars characters are so much fun to draw!
---
It‚Äôs -5,-6, or -7 trophies. Yes that troll does need to get banned, but it‚Äôs really not a big deal
---
dicktip spike
---
Thats your luck
---
He just said matchmaking can't filter out afk players
---
Ash....
---
Finally someone used the template correctly!
---
Maybe it‚Äôs a bug
---
The back button on Android, which is why this wasn‚Äôt a thing on global
---
It‚Äôs a legendary, congrats!
---
Yep, I got them back but he needs to be stopped before this happens to anyone else
---
Leon gets a buff
---
I've had this few times with mortis, rushing into enemy, getting super, clicking it i heard those bat noises, and i died, and still had my super
---
Take it back
---
stealed. whats the average age of that sub ? 12? How can ones in their right mind not implode of stupidity after writing fucking STEALED
---
disgraceful yet bold.
---
Haha bad lucc
---
Simple and ez
---
