Many days i didn't see your art again?

Yes

Everything on the hot is all poco related, just how I like it

No

Mortis would still win this happened to me

Gotta wait a day
---
Made with mematic
---
I swapped my alt to North Korea

Lmao

Thats gae xd
---
Why is there a watermark if you know people are going to use it
---
F to pay "recpect" and F _tier_
---
Credits :v
---
I feel like it's fake... but if it is real... Nice job
---
Thank you! This is a much older art style I have that was kinda inspired by a favorite comic series.
---
ok
---
It is a cute and simple name. A lot shorter than Athena that is for sure.
---
That counts as teaming
---
It's okay if you don't believe it. It is true though!
---
&gt;all of them have their star power on siege

Now this is cursed

Bob also has a nice hat.

Wow,  *P E N N Y S U P E R I N T E N S I F I E S*
---
ok, then Great job!
---
I agree
---
okay sure :\]
---
‚ÄúI talked about it two days ago and there is the Brawl Talk probably‚Äù
---
But people will assume it's a (re)(post)
---
Great super on that crow bro
---
High quality post
---
It will make up for losing like 3000 trophies
---
Seems accurate (thanks for the link to my favorite song)
---
High quality comment :)
---
Why would he drink?
---
Honestly, I'm quite fine how she is now. However, I would a appreciate just a small buff so she doesn't rely of her turret so much.
---
But can you do this
---
Yes good point thx
---
My not that ain't lucky this
---
ok listen I was one of fortnite biggest fans and players I‚Äôve always defended the game against people hating on it...this is considered as a joke there are a shit ton of other people doing memes about fortnite vs BS and you wanna know why?? BECAUSE WE ARE IN BRAWL STARS SUB REDDIT that‚Äôs why! We not going to make memes about another video game or random subject. Anyways all these fortnite vs brawl stars posts are only for jokes and nothing else!
---
Dont woooosh me, but it has horns
---
Idk
---
GOOD SKIN...BUT DONT HOPE THAT SUPERCELL WILL ADD THAT
---
Why is bull a dog?
---
Amazing XD
---
That‚Äôs enough Reddit for today
---
All pets/spawnnables can see in bushes or invisible leons.  Tara star power, bruce, scrappy, penny mortar
---
I honestly have no idea all I talked about was accounts lol it‚Äôs ok.
---
What the actually fuck is this
---
:V
---
Repost!!
---
Why you say that
---
THE NEW BO BUFF LOOKS GREAT SO FAR
---
Look at the comment below.
---
But is poco, who don't like poco? He is amazing!
---
I made him a movie for him
---
It‚Äôs just for fcking meme purposes only personally I don‚Äôt think BS is better than fortnite or Fortnite better than BS it‚Äôs just the fact that people are doing this ‚Äúbeef‚Äù for the jokes and the memes that‚Äôs all nothing else for example let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm in fortnite sub reddit I‚Äôll make memes of fortnite being superior then this then that you feel me? But anyways like I said it‚Äôs for the memes and if you take this personally it ain‚Äôt my problem
---
What
---
The name of the artist is right there in the pic
---
I'm going to yeet this
---
Thank you.
---
Jokes are intended to be funny though. This is just kinda bland and overdated. Supercell hired the Fortnite streamers and while that was happening the joke might have made sense. It‚Äôs been like 2 weeks since then. No one is doing memes on this topic now, you‚Äôre just being weird and odd.
---
what a nice way to say "thank you".
---
My name in the game is : ramy
---
I can Understand if they're within the detection ring but Bruce follows whatever brawler is closest just like the boss robot does except if Leon goes invisible and gets far away enough from the boss robot it will either stop searching or go to the next closest brawler

Did you play with them recently? You can go into battle log (top right corner, then it should be in the side menu) and send them a friend request by clicking on their brawler icon. If not, I'm afraid you can't get them back.

Don't be sad. There are people like that. We are here for you!

One of the rare moments when teaming is actually acceptable. Good job there!
---
Bro I'm agreeing with you.
---
He was playing siege bro, as soon as siege event ended he came back and clicked the screenshot and you can see star token available for brawl ball match
---
Same goes for jokes: Mortis hunts dynamikes, Leon goes invisible, it's impossible to win with randoms, Shelly super, Bull bush, Nita sacrifices bear, and some more that I can't remember now.
---
Satisfaction..
---
He was playing siege and as soon as the event ended play again button disappeared and he came back to the home screen and clicked this screenshot
---
Cool
---
Why are you complaining bro. I'm at 8k and have no legendaries and 21/26. It amazes me that people who have legendaries and all mythics complain, much less someone at only 6k. Some beta players don't even have a legendary.
---
Ain't complaining, I'm just informing the guy above.

Some lucky and P2P people get legendary at 500-1000 trophies also

Wow hold up we don‚Äôt pay our internet by gb we pay it by time like we play 60000 dinars for a month of internet
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt think she needs a big buff, just a buff to the turrets health and maybe -0,1 reload for Jessie.
---
I remember back when Chinese New Year was coming, the TV ads are so popular in Taiwan.
---
Look at him he is so happy
---
The first account a week ago and the other since global

I have all the rare brawlers

I only need 3 legendaries and then I have all of them

He is gonna get sponsored by brawl stars and play it soon lol just like ninja and other ppl

Mortis buff?
---
May I know how you create this picture?
---
I do that every time I‚Äôm the boss on my main. I only play one ticket and bring shelly. She‚Äôs great defensively. But she‚Äôs a terrible big brawler. Spin2win for 5 other people!
---
Colt is to old to be pams child

Man man just use MORTIS!

When u r bored af ......

I just draw them and copy and pasted health bars form Brawl stars.

Bro I did the same and still shocked

Can't relate since I never get new Brawlers.
---
I got my first at 8k
---
I wish I had that skin I would do anything to get it
---
u forgot the brawl ball lmao
---
Supercell: WERE RELEASING A HUGE UPDATE!
---
Supercell: WERE ADDING 10 NEW BROCK SKINS, 9 NEW BARLEY SKINS AND 8 NEW NITA SKINS!
---
Imagine fighting against that Mortis in gem grab/siege or even showdown as a low hp brawler
---
How So? I'm 18 So I'm Allowed To Porn
---
But si soooo expensive (150 gems)
---
Cant wait to start relating to you in a few days

YEEEAAA BOOOIIIII

You men the nr2 channel ;)

or more if its something overpowered like bibi

I love this
---
I have the clashmas penny
---
I bought him
---
100% Penny Star Power Buff
---
I don't even have the Star Power
---
The more brawlers with max powerpoints the more gold you will get from boxes. 
---
Unlike Royale, where it shows the maxed card and then converts to gold, brawl stars just converts it in the background at the same price as the shop (2 gold for each powerpoint)
---
First pipis, now bene
---
amazing!
---
lmao
---
Got all 3 of the brawliday skins and star shelly. That's it. 12.3k player beta
---
F
---
sure
---
Have you ever thought about he/she is reposting because they like it.
---
Exactly. Initially, it really wasnt that bad. The whole buff this buff that thing is overdone now though. It's like a trend. It's cool when it's in, but once its overused and annoying, it shouldn't be brought back up nearly as much
---
for the star power this would be a good idea
---
Love the way daryll looks like.
---
Oh my God finally someone noticed this post
---
Mean **Bene** machine
---
Fun fact: a friend of my brither got crow at 300 total trophies

I know, but it says it's a new skin
---
I can't really remember if I was doing so but thanks for the clarification!! :D
---
Nah. As long as they have it I'm good
---
Bro wtf
---
And, how happy you was?
---
I got mines at an lower chance so i think it is pretty decent
---
Nita and Brock have some good ones too
---
Link?
---
They're completely neglecting HayDay. I think they don't care about HayDay as much as they do about Clash Royale. I really hope they add something HayDay-themed. I would really-really love that.
---
Yes and no. The throwers could just continue to chip your health if you don't have a wall breaker
---
Ye :3
---
But I wonder more haven‚Äôt :\
---
Right now I don't think he needs a buff or nerf
---
Nice editwork
---
It was in the morning and i jumped so fast out of the bed because i could not believe it i am f2p btw
---
But I found 59 gems 3 months after Christmas so in March, now it's June, you're not as stupid as me you are infinetly more stupid than me
---
what if mortis' shovel worked like those weapons from RWBY that are both melee and a gun tho
---
Unfortunately supercell works with small teams meaning they barely have an update after 1 month as shown by the last 2 updates
---
doesn‚Äòt work for whatever reason.. send me the code
---
it says right in there, "*POCO DOES 99999999 DAMAGE AND HAS RANGE OF THE WHOLE MAP 370¬∞ AND HIS ATTACK DESTROYS ALL WALLS. HP IS REMOVED, SINCE HE IS IMMORTAL.*"
---
Thats true! (I would like to say that im against teaming and i never teamed because it ruins the game)
---
not sure, remember watching it on kairos's channel...
---
either of them
---
like OJ or kairos
---
XVPLLMDS
---
Why'd they fire him?
---
Yeah but blue side benefits long range brawlers like penny and piper more.
---
Feel bad for u have 2 at 7.8
---
Bruh you broke the chain
---
same but uninstalled it a while ago cuz shit happens
---
omg.... i should have done that!
---
and of course, I almost forgot, "*PENNY MORTAR'S CANNONBALLS NOW HOME INTO CLOSEST ENEMY, NO MATTER WHAT.*"
---
Power level difference is not the issue. Total trophies and experience level are more determinants
---
The problem with all these buff trends is that the brawlers that actually need buffs(tara...frank) never get any attention while well balanced brawler(crow...poco) are on crusades to be buffed. Crow was absolutely fine before his buff. Poco is absolutely fine right now. But Tara and frank. They truly suck in most situations.
---
Maybe it is split up into 2 videos
---
question: does gunshien rewritten exists
---
It was joke man no hard fealings me: gets punched in the face by goblin prisoner
---
Well, Leon is a normal kid, and hes young, so i assumed that he would just play outside.
---
That pose is a meme on its own.
---
Tbf if they mentioned hay day everyone would make fun of them and say something like ‚Äúpfft hay day. Tooting your horn there supercell‚Äù
---
[Angry]
---
But she is kool. ;)
---
nice art, but she kinda looks chinese now lol
---
Yeah, especially tara. She has nothing she truly excels at. I'm hoping the next set of changes does her well. She's so much fun to play and I was so happy to unlock her only to realize she was sub par and then slowly and slowly fell off even more
---
Yes v:
---
Is that brawl stars but just at very low quality?
---
Tara is my name taring is my game
---
Is he also a retarded ol‚Äô miner?
---
showdown should be the only mode with unsymmetrical maps tbh

I only play with the brawlers I like (primo, penny, jessie, rosa) and when I do, I play excessively til they're always 500+. Meanwhile Rico and colt are still below 200 üòÖ do feel bad for them sometimes lol.
---
I have 23 brawlers at 10,000 trophies and I'm a beta player. My friend is a global player with 25 brawlers and 6,200 trophies. Both are F2P
---
Well, if it makes you feel any better. The FBI is about to find me
---
but phones... as many said when brawl was 2d, it ran like it was butter... on a piece of toast. maybe 2D can be a old skin fix and a option for those who have lag?

Hol up.  You can manually aim?

please buff tara mortis poco and piper if possible
---
Yes, but if you Want to..
---
That doesn‚Äôt help if you can‚Äôt hit them though...
---
At least call here "Chi" not "Ch" that is just a weird grunt
---
True
---
This happened to me but with a jessie yes a jessie
---
That what i though
---
It's even more so true when you take even on bit of damage and everyone teams on you

Who are you?

Feel the same way. I ignore most of the posts on here these days. The only reason I haven‚Äôt left it is because of the amazing art that gets posted once in a while. Moderaters literally don‚Äôt exist for this sub. That‚Äôs why all the shitty memes and shitposting is allowed.
---
I agree, she is far too annoying to deal with, I see her EVERYWHERE I play, Bounty, showdown, gem grab, and even heist, it's too annoying and with the energy drink modifier she is really annoying and deals a crap ton of damage. That is why she needs a nerf with either her range or her damage or just something that'll make players use her less, maybe more hits for her super to charge
---
Oof my bad. Mortis is Also pretty decent in BB
---
Shelly? No-No-No MORTIS YES!
---
No, is a new brock skin i think
---
Ok but first i need a follow from u ok?

He didn't even crop the black parts (the bars that only appear for mobile devices) or the watermark. If he's dumb enough to not even edit anything about the picture, I think that he won't care that much about the amount of upvotes. I mean, he didn't even bother to make his own stuff.

Or you are only one who thinks that pennys star power needs buff... all the pro players have said that it is op rn
---
Piper should not have her own tier, dyna should.
---
Oh was this yours? It‚Äôs amazing!
---
Oh yeah peach is very good at throwing her voice
---
That Dragon Knight Jessie is such a good offer, what should I do?
---
Cutie pie for you
---
I did this because i want a new cool and hot looking male brawler.
---
It's the 2 new barley skins and brock skin in the same place
---
"Oh, my! Come kiss my grids!"
---
YES
---
If only it was that simple and it never happens again...
---
"Gimme some sugar!"
---
I think that is Bo
---
How the heck boss for every round
---
"Come get it!"

I think it's Bo
---
Same here 50% of the time.

God the entire subreddit would go insane with the low effort posts.
---
That‚Äôs nice
---
wouldnt work cuz for you, it would be downvotes, for the enemy it will be upvotes. cuz arrows arent 2 directions. its 1 direction. so what u see is the opposite of waht the enemy sees
---
Is a remodel to Road Rage Carl
---
That's also true, I usually let her deal chip damage to see if her super is ready.
---
Petition for a low effort meme maker to get this for free.
---
As a bull main I would be scared if this was real.
---
Nice
---
Yes! I've learned it from some monks in an abandoned temple high in the mountains of Tibet. They're quite nice actually
---
Well yes but no  
---
in my experience neutral evil goes abit more out of their way to do evil  
---
pennys star power doesnt choose randomly just the person closest to it
---
You spelt Leon wrong.
---
Wow really good art dude.Keep going ü§©

Old Brock looks like a drug addict

I tried not aitoing my shots as bull and aiming his shots

It was actually more fun than straight up spamming

Sure it costed me few matched because of spammy el Primo but It was more fun to actually aim lol
---
WOW

my piper attacked us

It isn‚Äôt her normal voice, it‚Äôs just her scream when she makes a shockwave.

I really like this drawing, good job!
---
No, he's not. Just a person with a fake clan. You messed up by promoting them, there is nothing we can do.
---
For the best experience, read this while listening the song "Those nights" by Bastille. I highly recommend it.

Thank you everyone for so much love and support. I will keep this story alive while I can (I am gonna have a job soon, so I may not post that frequently)

How many trophies

oh god no. please lewd NieR, Bayonetta, or an *adult* game.

He looks so happy! This is an amazing skin concept.

*how* do you guys do it?!

How do you still not understand how matchmaking works while at 300 trophies ?

Did i even mention that i made a pixel art?

Sol√≥wa pod bramƒÖ?

He‚Äôs op in duo showdown way better then in solo
---
I bought it too, I really love this skin and the discount was really good
---
FBI......., you already know ;-;
---
Bruh the blue side gets that part too, one game you spawn in the part where there is rocks and the next round you spawn on the fence part
---
bruh üíØü§£ü§£üíØüëå
---
Just a theory:
---
They put this Jessie on such a good sale because then you‚Äôll spend all your gems on that and when the next update comes out soon they‚Äôll pack a whole bunch of good skins with it. But you don‚Äôt have any gems to buy those skins anymore so you have to go pay for the gems in the shop
---
*marketing 101
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Yea that‚Äôs a great idea! Probably have a scale of dollars to gems and discounts(because the more you spend, the gems:dollars ratio increases)
---
Im saving my gems for a lengdary cause I have enough for a offer just want one to come to the shop.
---
I thought her dress is blue.
---
Ah yesss stripper Piper
---
Damn! How?
---
The big box rework would make it harder to get and bring down its value as well... Math
---
Supercell wants to know your location
---
I have exactly 17 trophies and have every single brawler in the game, you all just suck lol /s
---
Ok this has to be fake. If you sum all of the 3v3 2v2 and showdown matches using an average of 6 trohpies you get 9990.
---
This same exact thing happened to me...except the bot was in the ike zone...and we lost by 1% üò≠
---
#STOP
---
But they buff dynamike(he already was OP), nerf Darryl star power, buff Penny's SP

When read the balance notes for Morris then find out his reload speed gets lessened by only 0.1 seconds.

It doesn‚Äôt even make sense... SD x Bounty?

She really don't  need voice because she is mysterious brawler (Change my mine ....Tara is name Uno is my game)

Make him Mythic since 1) he had lots of unique mechanics like Mythics, and 2) Dragons are Mythical. Other than that, amazing!!!

Perfect

I mean, why not! Right, u/Mr_J- ? Also yeah Bastille is my favorite band atm. I have been listening to their stuff since 2 years ago

No, they are still in 2019

It takes way to long, and I hate losing because I can‚Äôt hit a Shelly even though I have 15 power

Lol that was quick, never expected someone to search this Baxtrix bastard up on yt

Love it

REEEEEEEE

And it allows for people to benefit from being killed

Anybody else find Carl‚Äôs voice highly annoying?!?
---
Yes dynamike deserves that
---
I never heard about him lol
---
Wrote his name, saw first 10 suggestions, and closed the app. The worst part about these youtubers is they have some people following them lol

I expect you to post this there
---
Yeah soz I only use my right one when in game lol
---
If you comment on a repost and he starts arguing and spamming more reposts, ignore it.
---
Mostly young kids around 8 or 9 because that's bassicky 80% of the youtube population. Plus I swear Baxtrix makes more clickable videos than Morgz does lol
---
yeah, e barbs are trash but really annoying if overleveled
---
Sacrifice your self so long as you can land some shots for the super and then launch most effective super landing on the most gathering of bushes and walls, works well also in that bush map whereyou can make borders
---
oh
---
Why so down bro?
---
I have failed your expectations.
---
Estou feliz que voc√™ tenha feito uma conta! Seguiu! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Yes yes yes yes yes
---
YES!!
---
That's also doesn't work, landing 4 shots with brock and suiciding isn't worth it, you could accidentally kill someone in the process of Terri g your super which will raise your bounty pecel
---
It was called smash and grab
---
STOP YOURE A TERRIBLE HUMAN
---
SOMEONE DID THIS TO ME WITH MORTIS SO THERE WAS NO ESCAPE

To show that poco was so good back then

u/NemGa_ strikes again

 Don't know if you know, but it've been called gem grab since a lot of time
