I see what you‚Äôre trying to do with the water on this map, but I think penny can survive 1 to 2 shots from the IKE to just go around. Might want to make it so it‚Äôs practically impossible to go around. Unless that was your intent, which in that case, good job!
---
Since they are considering a battle season pass system, i think they can make it so that players can buy a fixed amount of "badges" as a currency with coins if they have purchased the seasonal battle pass. And those "badges" can be used to redeem exclusive skins or boxes. 
---
I also think they can inplement an achievement system that goes hand in hand with trophy road that allows players to unlock skins/icons. For example, getting a brawler to 800 trophies will grant you a skin that is only obtainable that way. This will be needed if they do implement another league/rank system as they want to retain incentive for pushing trophies in "normal games". 
---
Obviously the achievement system can also contain achievements that are ranked/league based such as "getting to challenger" (Challenger refers to league of legends league system which is essentially the highest rank possible)

In December, I unlocked Tara in the morning, and at dawn the next day I unlocked Mortis (he really was a Creature of the Night, heh), and after that I did not get any more Brawlers, and I lack the legendary and Gene. I hope to unlock Carl, maybe he'll make my luck come back again

&gt; "Get rid of siege..."
---
Well, no.
---
I'm looking forward to a "real" competitive mode where you play a couple modes with the same team and opponent in a row, testing the real overall skills and game understanding. Something like the competitive mode for over-watch where you get to pick a team comp and communicate with your team before the game mode starts.
---
Obviously this would be cool if they can implement a ban-pick phase before the mode.
---
The downside to this is competitive mode will be rather time consuming. Assuming 3 game modes per competitive game, and the average game time to be 3 minutes (just an assumption considering gg, bb, bounty, heist and siege), and assuming that ban-pick phase takes a minute, including load time it would take 15 minutes or so for one complete competitive game.
---
Thank you! I really liked him
---
THIS IS SO UNDERRATED THIS MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD
---
Mortis best? Lol and forget about Jessie and Nita
---
yeah, that's what he really needs
---
Agreed, or just do away with heist all together it feels like siege with less depth and usually ends up being a select few brawlers that are in every single game  
---
Oi
---
Good idea heheheHEEHEHEHEHHEHEHE

It would be a good alternative!

Super sweet!
---
Seeing all these amazing  skin ideas makes me wanna try making some myself
---
Interesting, they could just drop the trophies you get from 10-12 to 8-10. The games are much longer though so its a possibility that at higher trophies games would take the entire 4 and a half minutes more often. Even if they nerf the trophies you get to the ground and make it permanent it would be my preferred way to push its much better than the other modes (imo)

Could spike ambush you from literally anywhere?

I definitely would play in this map, nice

Super recharge is damage based, that's why with AoE brawlers like frank, Poco, Penny, Brock, Barley, Mike, ect, it recharges faster (or instantly recharged like Shelly if you hit multiple people)
---
Amazing as everytime

WOW!!!!

The downvoters are the auto aim Shellys in showdown lol

uh no but I'm curious now

The bo miss 3 times

Autoaim god
---
This is so fucking accurate
---
Yeah so when he passes Frank and reaches the IKE turret, the turret will switch targets to Bull at full health, meaning he can unload all of his shots and still do the damage with his faster reload even afterwards. This means that not only can Bull do the damage with double reload, he can do 2-4 extra shots of damage without his star power being triggered.

I like all the ideas though I honestly don‚Äôt see how Poco‚Äôs super is useless. It depends if the player is selfish, that‚Äôs when it sucks. Maybe a fix is that it heals in every direction instead of an aimed attack. I doubt Jessie and Penny are gonna change looks, they already have several skins, don‚Äôt think supercell is down to revamp it all.

I hate playing siege w/ randoms, but if you lose so many trophies, don't play. If you have a clan, play w/ them.

Haven‚Äôt seen one of these memes in 5 seconds

Did you ask supercell for a refund? If so then they gaved you negative gems to compensate

I think the algorythm just calculates an average cup count for the entire team and matches you up with a team with similar average, so you can get a team like, 500 80 200 (260 average cups), vs 220 220 300 (246 average cups), as an example if you team with a friend with a low cup count.

I prefer tank favoured maps because maps like Double Trouble and Dune Drift which have more diversity also result in more teaming. Also, Island Invasion has been taken over by teaming Pams

well you are standing good i got my 1 legy (leon) after 8 month and a new brawler

Wow that was a dirty move from that mortis.

They were just having a little fun because the match was basically already over but mortis backstabbed the shelly for no actual reason whatsoever, that part confuses me as well, players normally don't do that in those situations.
---
Facts b
---
I dont get it. What is teaming? Is that duos?
---
I noticed the skin in the shop and and clicked it. Once. Exited out and everything was fine. Later on, I realized the deal was gone. After checking I noticed that the game showed the skin as purchased. I can guarantee I did not misclick or buy the skin but there it was. This has never happened with any item and was a little strange. Seeing the various posts of people mentioning it, I do believe there was a bug on this item which would somehow purchase with 1 click.

---
While shelly gets you down to maybe 1/2 health, with poison she will continue to take damage and you can heal to 80%/full health before attacking again and likely kill her. 
---
Just keep a distance from other brawlers and push other players into unsafe territory. Crow is OK for what he is but I do not think he is worth the title of legendary status. He's just annoying af to fight and to play.
---
dude, he literally got that after he got a _S P I K E_.
---
I said "AT LEAST" meaning it should be more than 150 gems.

a brawler that can deal poke damage to enemies to charge their super quickly.

I still missing Spike, Gene and Leon (I've been playing for more than a year and a half). I've already maxed all my brawlers, and I can't spend my coins until I unlock them...
---
Rico's gun
---
I think his was better...made more sense to me
---
jesus fucking christ I will pray for you
---
Now this i like, as always great job gedi-kor, if i could i would give you platinum
---
Rich Rico for 300 gems, because you need to be rich in order to get a rich skin
---
Illusion 100
---
Ya know, it may be scary as enemies will come from all directions, but I really want to see like 5 people fly by in the corner of my screen 
---
Its not shelly,colt and pennie
---
Its shelly,colt and poco
---
Lmao, this.
---
He was balanced before this recent update and didn't need this last nerf in my opinion.
---
This map is prbabky the one the most well put spawnpoints...
---
&gt;Wow these are amazing. It's hard to believe this was made by an amateur. I hope you continue making these!
---
Ok, Thank you so much!! üòä
---
three of the legendaries then?
---
THIS COMMENT WAS MADE BY r/mortisgang
---
Korea I believe.
---

---
nice!
---
Oh wow really?
---
i once threw the ult on the gems at the corner too, then blasting off after picking up all the gems and with the ult exploding. if only replays were available then XD
---
OMG  it's funny sale on everydays.
---
&gt;I love them all, but I can't help but see the spacing between spikes eyes seem off. I know as a fact I can't do better but once I seen that I can't unsee it.
---
Actually, I made Spike the first time. It's when I have a lot of immature parts.üòÇ I agree with you. Thank you!!
---
Rico in Spanish means rich so makes sense
---
Here's to hoping rico would get the brock pull the glasses down animation!

Carl: *films this* this is gonna be good

Gene: ahahahhaa yea

U like it????..

 In fact, you should have a better understanding of light and darkness than the power of the program. So if I make a YouTube video, I will provide a more faithful basic than the process. :)
---
Well this video proves you‚Äôre nothing but a troll, Poco doesn‚Äôt stand a Chance from the start...
---
MiGhT W I T C H sorry for the spelling I could edit it
---
Let's take him in!
---
It makes sense because Jessie is an engineer and steam punk's use a lot of techs and what knot so yea I approve
---
lol
---
C'mon, poco doesnt stand a chance in showdown in any way and you know it. Especially in feast or famine.
---
What do you think this post is about? Proving a point that something needs to be fixed, surely you don‚Äôt expect every single player to just let them walk awayüòÇ
---
ik i got him at 2k i didnt even know legendaries were rare then
---
Woaw Thank you so much : )
---
People don't actually need to spin in excess to team. Also just because you spin does not mean you want to team because you might want to backstab. 
---
Meh, trying too hard to be funny there

 This is not really a serious concept. So if you want a serious concept, you might not like it. I'm sorry I did not meet expectations.  :)
---
1) put them in order from small to big, *please*
---
2) 140 coins from a small box isn‚Äôt worth it. One box contains fewer than 140 coins, even if we take into account the powerpoint.
---
Poco does stand a good chance in this map if he can actually get away from his spawn point ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Every showdown map should be made playable for every brawler type. I‚Äôve come first heaps of times with every brawler on this map, including Piper and Poco.
---
That brawlbox is pretty expensive
---
This guy has done it again
---
Good stuff
---
Coco was released a few months after brawl stars soft launch......so u can't put copyright bulls**t stuff on supercell......üòÇ
---
Jessie's hot
---
140 absolutely is worth it. Long time players have tens of thousands with nothing to spend it on.
---
The robotic era... is near
---
Ouch, it hurts to play with randoms just for the star token what did it cost? Trophies.
---
Removed - This is an English speaking subreddit, characters not in the English language have been detected in your title. This may have been caused by emojis.
---
I believe powercubes are a permanent reward, where as yours would decrease Darryl's star power utility. Your idea could be good as a star power I would say, just not for every brawler when you kill someone.
---
A shield would mean that the last person that kills him gains the shield, but the person who made this person low life doesn't win anything, and that could be frustrating. This reason is also why I don't adhere with the reward of trophy when you kill someone. I like that powercubes drops where the player died so that the player who made the person low have a chance to get it, and not just the last player who killed him.

The problem with teaming is, If it‚Äôs not punishable, then why stop? The community has already tried to stop teaming but it didn‚Äôt work, now it‚Äôs up to supercell to fix the problem

I am waiting for your reply in directs....

Thanks, didn't know that TIL

If Supercell reads anything on Reddit, they already hired him

It will start monday when the season ends, until friday, because they did the same thig with Gene. Also the middle of the month (15) is friday, and if you payed attention you observed that they like to add skins/brawlers (gene until now) fridays.... And i like that because you have time to play with them in the weekend

I actually prefer the new one for some reason, I don't know why.

Hey so I have a question. Has your friend contacted our support in-game? Why are you doing all the talking for him? Also, We don‚Äôt steal anyone‚Äôs money, all transactions are managed and controlled through Apple both for purchases and refunds. There is an explanation for everything and if there has been a revocation of gems - there had to have been at lease one matching refund request. 
---
I advise you get your friend to do fight his own battles and contact us immediately so we can see what has happened. What you are claiming is just not true.
---
Thanks Blue!

Well done

This requires a modern move beyond science

Fair enough i forgot about those, but pretty sure if you want gems or new brawlers supercell could come up with something better

What if you maxed 100 coins for 50 coins?
---
Can you give me a bit of your luck? ;-;

yeah sorry i worded that wrong i think. It takes up a lot of data. So they‚Äôre probably trying to improve something about it before they release it to everyone
---
Yes, I was joking
---
That‚Äôs the a shadow but if you look closely there‚Äôs a creature of the night
---
Just wait, you can get boxes when the new brawlers comes out. that way you can level him up, because you will only get carl's points, and if you lucky you can get another brawlers.
---
I have all the points to level up all my brawlers, but I don't have tara, gene or spike :(
---
When you're so broke you have less than 0 gems. feelsbadman

I can dig it

And people say that Crow is bad. Level 7 at 500.

I think you didn't really understand that meme template. But still good.
---
It will be kind of like what happens to Mortis. They would hit the walls and not go past it. But it‚Äôs really easy to avoid them. This just makes sure there‚Äôs still some cover or ‚Äúprotection‚Äù for the Bull 
---
Hey u/GEDI-KOR. 
---
I've been making some brawl stars skins and, despite my efforts, they never seem to even compare to the level of yours. I was wondering what program you use to make 3D models. Thank you!
---
Lol they choked so bad
---
Skins.csv still states the skin should be 150 Gems, but 59 gems is a good price for it since it's so badly designed.
---
personally I sometimes need to spin to dodge shots as mortis or crow
---
I like your username :)
---
Ok I was looking at it and think wow that looks so damn familiar 
---
whoops my bad
---
Lolol people would be flexing with this skin!!
---
Change your flair brother mortis
---
You too hahah. Oh my god I‚Äôm not alone hallellujah I haven‚Äôt gotten a legendary since beta. I thought those old legendary powerpoints screwed me cause I pulled 3 of them. I tried to contact their support but I was just an automated response about how ‚Äúit takes a while‚Äù.

How is your crow maxed at 1900 trophies? I only have 3 max brawlers and I‚Äôm at 11700

Wow wish I was there for that lol

imagine superpower wit darril from bottom left to top

Have you thought about taking supercells job for the 3d artist
---
Thanks!  We only need imagination...
---
well I have about 11 brawlers with under 50 and the rest are all like 100-170 and I only play with crow
---
Max crow with less than 2k trophies. What are you doing?
---
Anime piper "this isn't even my final form!"

Only playing crow, that‚Äôs what

We asked for crow to be legendary and mortis to be mythical, then we‚Äôd be back here asking ‚Äúwhat if the rarities weren‚Äôt changed?‚Äù

Bouncy boy vs boot man
---
lol supercell is hiring a 3d artist and people saying "HIRE GEDI-KOR" and i'm saying that too lol
---
I'd say you should do skins to the brawlers who has the least amount of skins as of now, Piper being a great example of this may I say.
---
suira isn‚Äôt shelly a in heist

Not me my friend is saying this

r/subsithoughtifellfor

Yep

Not trophies, the level of the brawler is 10 with star power

You told us to change *your* mind though, not his

Don't know why but this remembered me FNaF: Sister Location... ("Funtime Rico")

Oh I literally only play with crow so I should have a lot more overall trophies just crow is more than 25% all of my trophies

Teaming is a legitimate strategy though. When you team, you do acknowledge you may be betrayed at any time. Survival of the fittest, after all.

Anyone experiencing serious lag and bugs lately? Just to name a few: 
---
* The wi-fi lagging problem is still not fixed. I've never had any issue with any other game (including Supercell games) lagging on wifi. 
---
* I typed a few messages in team chat that took a good 30-45 seconds to show up on the screen.  
---
* When changing brawlers, sometimes I have to select the new brawler multiple times. Often times it takes a long time to show up that I changed brawlers on the main page
---
* In games, I'll get random horrendous lag spikes for about 3-5 seconds. 
---
* All sorts of bugs in brawl ball, including it not allowing me to kick the ball away and sometimes my brawler will just stop moving for no reason.
---
I don‚Äôt think anything would change in terms of meta tbh
---
Poderia ter mais skins como nita polar,poco caveira de fogo e piper noiva.seriam boas skins
---
Ok, all 23 brawlers I have have 500+ trophies. That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm talking about. I only have 3 star powers and I‚Äôm at 11700 you are below 2000 how do you have the star power

That‚Äôs what heist was before they changed it except it was 3v3

Ha ha ha *COMEDY*
---
Piper and Leon are exceptions, also said by some Youtubers
---
Do you have any legendaries?
---
I spent all my coins on the points in the shop for crow and I didn‚Äôt upgrade like any other brawlers and in my 3rd brawl box I got his star power

Nope

Then all idiots will have boxes!!

You/Gedi-Kor now is your chance thier calling for you

Ok Bull is good but stuff is wrong with Shelly. Also I'm sorry.üò¢
---
Ok, thank you! :3
---
You're bad, El Primo is good and balanced !!! He has a superior speed than other brawlers, his attack is powerful, if a Primo with full health attack you and you're not a heavyweight, you're chance of dying is 100%.
---
Dodge with El Primo, and find the right angles to sneak into enemy attacks, and kill them. He's opportunist, as Mortis. A well-played El Primo is devastating and destroys the vast majority of Brawlers, even if they are played as well.
---
Shelly is just good in the meta. The one who needs a nerf is pam
---
You know what's funny? In Spanish, the Loaded Rico skin is called "Rico Rico" 
---
Perhaps decreasing damage dealt by an enemy after being hit by a separate enemy in Solo Showdown? For example say I‚Äôm playing Spike (cause a hypothetical situation is the only place I can), and a Barley and Dynamike are teaming. Say I get hit by Barley, and now Dynamike deals reduced damage to me. 
---
It‚Äôs not ideal as teaming would still be a good strategy, and I don‚Äôt have the exact numbers/specifics of how long you‚Äôd get damage resistance and a few others down as I think stuff like that would be better decided by the balance team and perhaps top players as well. Then of course there‚Äôs the possibility it backfires and leads to more advanced teaming, where people teaming could attack each other ensuring you do reduced damage to them. Still I guess it‚Äôs an idea Supercell could potentially work with. 
---
I‚Äôm just gonna think it‚Äôs not because it makes it that much more satisfying 
---
You‚Äôre so bad holy shit
