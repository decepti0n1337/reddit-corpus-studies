Maybe a new brawler with a brawler icon of them winking? Not that such information would tell us much about an actual brawler mechanically though (I think).
---
I have 3 ideas for skins please make them GEDI KOR 
---
.1 Executioner Carl The card from clash royale but in brawl stars
---
.2 Ghost spike 
---
.3 Dragon leon
---
I will be proud if i see them here in your account Please Make them!

add me. im looking.for people that arent braindead in showdown:)
---
I just hate meteor shower and island invasion both alone and especially together but ik this is just rage, but i do think having modifiers constantly is annoying
---
america explain
---
I think once you get to 350/400+ trophies is where you see the bigger decline of crow
---
Looks good to me
---
Finally
---
You can get Barley for free though
---
No, they need voices. Even Daryl. 
---
Oof
---
F
---
Carl with walls would be muscle spongebob
---
I don't even know. Sometimes they spawn deep in the poison or sometimes right next to you 
---
Barley: This one's from the house! And also this one! Oh, and this one too! And this one! And this one! Ah, I almost forgot this one!
---
Bo: My mine is clear. Or should I say... my mine rain!
---
Hahahaha, nice conversation sir 
---
Yea but at 3rd place you don‚Äôt lose anything. So you only have to beat out two teams to maintain progress.

Nothing is more satisfying than clipping someone at the very tip of your range dealing double the damage instantly with the drink

How would you edit it?

To whoever gave me gold, thank you very much!

Seriously tho. Do more of these this is incredible

What if they focused on the things that are making this a shitty game before they keep building up on a horrible foundation....?

I have insider information

Supercell is a shit show.  If you have an iphone or ipad, best bet is to reach out itunes support via their chat app.  Supercell will just push you off on them anyways even if in the end it requires apple to reach out to them to fix their app.

What is this heresy?

There is actually no need for more Mortis skins.

This is amazing! X,D

What did you use to edit the game files? I would love to try this myself!

Maybe gem grab, But not showdown.

Update: Im currently sitting at 5,421 trophies. I have unlocked every brawler except Leon and Crow without a single cent spent in-game!  Poco is at level 9 and Im waiting on a star power! Thanks for your advice!  my tag is

Yes officer this comment right here

Sadly no

Nobody wanted to buy it I guess

Direct hit is deadly.

Nope.. don‚Äôt think so. But I did as soon as it was released. I just win them a lot lol it‚Äôs all about the walk

That ain't the point

u/gedi-kor

Ok, Thanks!

yeah, i want at least 1 trophy for 3rd place, cuz 5th place gets you 1
---
360 degree poco attack?
---
Lmao, they should just have one in every 1 million games get buffed like that. Imagine the weird playground legends that would spread if they just fucked with a few people
---
I wish my teamates and cousin did that, but nah, I am the only waiting for 'em!
---
Shelly's super is one of the only reasons she's good, though. Otherwise, she's outclassed by every other close ranged brawler, and she already can't deal with farther-ranged brawlers.
---
Np
---
with my play style im better off doing the auto aim 
---
Kill and don't die. 
---
Nah, it should be changed to ‚ÄúGood job for not wasting money on pixels!‚Äù.
---
Study the spike movements, it goes in six directions, no matter how you shoot it, the six spikes will always go in the same direction as it always does, you can use this to hit players behind cover
---
Or as u/JETRUG was saying a trophy for every kill
---
Your name tho

I want this a new game mode. NOW
---
Bro WonderBrad already completed this challenge on his channel and he played against REAL people
---
Get 52 cups with him and you are ok

Spike does not need a buff. Spike and Leon have completely different play styles, nobody is gonna try to kill from a distance while playing Leon.
---
Nostalgia!

Well, kind of. So take my upvote

That is very true, but they just might because the brawlers are individual characters, unlike the characters in other games.

Don‚Äôt buy Carl it‚Äôs not good at that high trophy amount

Damn that free box is a really good offer. You should go get it

Crow needs a buff

Leon is pretty bad now but still playable
---
Spike is good but not op
---
Pam is op
---
Better than night witch mortis
---
No, basicly It's a shooter on Steam with multiple game modes.
---
You can pick various classes for very different play styles because each has a unique weapon and some mechanics.
---
I recommend it.. it's one of the best games of this type IMHO.
---
You never know that might be him 
---
Not possible boy :(
---
Yea.. it's better not to have those possible brawlers in the meantime while collecting boxes for no purpose whatsoever.

SAME FOR ME HERE, THE RNG IN THIS GAME IS SO UNFAIR! MY FRIEND GOT SPIKE AT 700 TROPHIES AND I DON‚ÄôT HAVE ANY LEGENDARY AND I HAVE ONE MYTHIC. I‚ÄôM AT 4,3K TROPHIES!

In one of my posts I was a crow with 4 boosts and there was a Leon with 7 and I was annoying him so much(btw I killed him)
---
Just did this and i can confirm it works
---
I just love your artworks so much that I had to remake one of them, they look really cute and awesome at the same time! üòÇüòä
---
Buy this offer, it will get you more stuff in the long run, a new brawler will recude the chances of you getting points for your other brawlers and you missing out on 250+ gold and like a hundred power points. There's a good chance for you to get a brawler ( I'm not that lucky so I only got Derryl in like 8-9 mega boxes
---
r/woosh
---
Nth special especially u r using throwers (tht offers control) not assassin brawlers like primo mortis etc. Also ur barley trophies is quite low so u r facing players much lower (total) trophies than u 
---
I haven‚Äôt gotten a new brawler in 3 months. And I saved about 100 boxes for Carl but didn‚Äôt get anything from them either. Also got nothing from the 4K and 5K mega boxes.

You are my favourite artist! So cute!

He is good in Gem Grab and some map of Bounty also I think, as his Super can tag &amp; drag the enemy gem carrier &amp; enemy with most stars and/or fleeing after swept the gems/stars.

I mean, this is the pinnacle flaw of a team-based game, right? You can basically only expect your randomized teammates to be worse than actual bots. I guess that‚Äôs what keeps it interesting, but I think many players find the frustrations not worth it, rightfully so. Not much the dev team can do other than introduce game modes that rely on your abilities and your abilities alone. 
---
Knowing Valve, I think it'll take 2 more years (even in brawl stars)

Yes

Spike hide and seek
---
He got spike at 800 trophies
---
Yes, that could happen, up to 500 trophies As there would be no more checkpoints after that.
---
Playing safe is not necessarily fun for me, like bush camping in showdown.
---
I am pretty high in trophies 12k and I hate to play competitively, I just want a way to play the game without worrying about loosing my progress.
---
change is good
---
Oof that's disappointing... let's at least hope it comes soon.
---
I just meant that all it takes is grinding to get to 300 and is no indicator of how many boxes you have opened. If you enjoy the game and you like going beyond available tokens then just keep playing and eventually you will get them all. Also for some perspective: I opened 900 boxes and didn't get Leon when he came out.

Actually the current system gives much more information.

For example in showdown, seeing the player who last dealt damage to the deceased is a useful hint to who you should watch out for and what strategy to employ, especially when you have some idea as to where the deceased went before they died.

Put the guantlet on the left hand with the hammer, then when he uses his super the infinity stones can glow and the hammer can glow (like he is using the infinity stones to power the hammer like ronin does in guardians of the galaxy movie).

Frank, Pam, Leon? I think Frank and Pam are better than the majority, Plus barley is better than dynamike, so dynamike shouldn‚Äôt even be on the list. He is still very good, but barely is noticeably better,

I agree, Frank is inherently powerful but he still takes a lot of skill.
---
I know there was a time he was op but i think you should get your super faster
---
FA-
---
This is literally the worst suggestion I have heard and I regret wasting my time commenting on it. I will leave some final words. 
---
If someone gets close to you then OBVIOUSLY they are going to autoaim. You want to be able to do quick damage to someone who gets close to you. I don't see why you are against that.. I would like to remind you that brawl stars is a 2D game. If you don't know how to check bushes and a bull gets close to you obviously you're dead, you just have to learn to stay away from them rather than complaining that they need to be able to aim. 
---
Pros will use autoaim. They will choose when to use it and use it at the right time. It's a strategical decision. Autoaim is soooo easy to counter. Most brawl stars projectiles move relatively slowly meaning that they can be dodged fairly easily.
---
Since when are shotgun fights meant to be high skill? I would like to remind you again that it is a 2D game. The skill is in not going in to that shotgun fight, checking the bushes (which can't be done with autoaim), predicting where they will be (which also can't be done with autoaim), choosing to eliminate someone else instead, or just literally not getting close to them. You're obviously going to die if you're a piper and you get rushed by a bull. The bull doesn't need to be good at aiming, it's your mistake for going near a bush without checking it.
---
By tedious I mean if someone gets close to you having to drag the joystick out to defend yourself when someone else already has a shot lined up on you. All new players start off with shelly, who is a low skilled brawler (like all tanks) who needs to be able to unload a good amount of damage if she gets in close, without having to spend ages aiming.
---
If the main problem you have found with this that it will nerf close range brawlers, and the main time autoaim is used is close range, then what's the point? Don't allow them to autoaim but give them more damage...? 
---
If you are not in close range and you're losing to brawl stars then you really need to learn how to counter it. And by countering it I mean moving.
---
I really do hope that I have answered all of your questions. 
---
I would like to mention once again that brawl stars is a 2D game. If someone gets close to you then you should be able to deal good damage without having to drag out the joystick and if you can't counter autoaim at long range you're a noob. You mentioned how shotgun fights are simply about spamming the button, with your changes it will be who can put their finger on the red circle and move it out first. That will make them require much more skill...
---
I see your point but if the boosts were very insignificant or the costs of the cheaper skins rose (Rockstar Colt, Bandita Shelly, etc.) then this could be better for F2Ps. Or maybe there could be one-use abilities.
---
That why u need competent teammates.. like do the Tara Frank Duo or play him in BB.. everything is possible.
---
My least favorite game mode.
---
Relatively uncreative first of all, because it's basically gem grab and heist in one mode.
---
And as many others have mentioned, you can win the first 3 waves, then lose the last and lose the game because they have a super high level robot. Although just making both robots spawn at the end would be a good solution.
---
And the penalty for losing is crazy. I understand it's all doubled because the game duration is about double, but it can get really frustrating.
---
I personally want to just completely do away with siege and make it brawl ball/showdown modifier again.
---
Free gems exelent idea
---
Really? Just to get more of the normal boxes? 
---
The first round is actually pretty important; it gives you control of the middle of the map. It's much easier to keep control than to gain it so winning the first siege can be very critical to winning future sieges. Therefore, I don't think each round should spawn 15 bolts, this would give the team who won the first siege a distinct advantage. 
---

Not necessarily. They can be there without Carl's consent.

This was a post of someone who modified el primo to be gigantic, with an insane health bar to boot. Why it was deleted I dont know, the person only played against bots. Maybe cuz they changed the games files
---
I feel this is a pointless discussion as well, supercell are never going to add something that will make lots of the players stop playing the game. Supercell want brawl stars to become more popular rather than less popular
---
Cool thanks
---
I love how they are shelly but their name is stop auto aim, shelly is an auto aim god
---
I'm guessing gem grab is your favourite mode since you're want siege to be more like it. Making the modes too similar is not a good idea. I think the fact that everyone has different game mode preferences is a testiment to how much variety is in the game. Siege as it is right now is one of my favourite modes.
---
~~oh~~ thanks

People do this a lot, part of the risk. I dont let em get close enough to kill me without a fight, i assure you doing this wont deter shit.
---
Thanks for the feedback. Just goes to show how different it is at our respective trophy levels. I'm around 200-300 with each brawler so as far as the matchmaking goes it wouldn't be an issue for me. I guess I should've been more specific... give us the *option* of more selective matchmaking. That way you can still queue normally if you want to. (I'm a big proponent of devs giving us more options, not taking them away or restricting the way we can play). 
---
I want to clarify what I meant on #1, and I'm sure we've all been in this situation... (I don't know the exact number of bolts spawned in each round so please take the example as an example): you win round 1 3v2, then you win round 2 8v5, then lose round 3 18v19. Your team collected a total of 29 bolts vs the other team's 19 total. 
---
The team that played worse for most of the game turned things around at the end or got lucky, squeaked out a marginal lead and got a powerful bot to pound your base with while your team only got a lvl 3 and lvl 8 bot which can easily be stopped, sometimes without doing more than 30% damage combined if you have good defense and the right brawlers. 
---
That's why I want the bolts to reset to 0 or whatever. The other team gets an 8 bolt headstart simply bc they got outplayed for 2 minutes? **I'm fine with you thinking I'm 100% wrong about this**, but honestly, do you think that's a fair situation? SC isn't going to make any of these changes so I'm just debating out of boredom/devil's advocate, but I really would like to know what you think.
---
Lol why is this funny LMAO. There is someone playing as the robot XD
---
This is gold.

Brawl stars with el primo and barley ‚öΩÔ∏è

Barley?

I don‚Äôt think they should just throw siege out of the window, instead they should listen to the most upvoted comments and improve the gamemode so everyone can have fun (Some people are already having fun, so even if they don‚Äôt do any improvements, they shouldn‚Äôt delete it)
---
I don't understand about that but thanks for replying ^^

Scorch shot from tf2?

This isn‚Äôt a problem. Sure it provides an outlet for  really good players to exploit and destroy noobs, but that‚Äôs part of the game. New players learn from these experiences and develop as a gamer, if that‚Äôs wrong then tips on reddit and tutorials on YT are immoral, but they‚Äôre not, and nothing is wrong minis either. 
---
And then you couldn‚Äôt see Leon

Do the power crates in the infinity gauntlets give him the power of hERe bIrDy BiRDy!

I mean they do that same thing with Clash-a-rama and already stated there wouldn‚Äôt be a brawl talk this month too. Not really surprising

Nice work although  it Can be improved

I probably have more trophies than you lol. And plus ur the loser for playing showdown and only pushing on showdown. Ur so pathetic.
---
But shelly can't super in time because she will already be dead. Bull can fire twice before shelly can fire twice, he has faster unload speed. And if shelly uses her super first, bull will survive the super and an extra hit and kill shelly before she can fire another super.
