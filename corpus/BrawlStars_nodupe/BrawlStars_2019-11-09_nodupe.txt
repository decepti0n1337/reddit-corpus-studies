Honestly Curveball was too OP and deserved it's nerf... it was just brainless free hits and impossible to dodge
---
That‚Äôs a Choice you made you can just wait it out nd you‚Äôll get another eventually
---
Why would you give Leon a damage buff?  Besides bull he all ready does the most damage at close range and his shots are easy to hit and it is really easy to get up clos using his ult and it‚Äôs easy to charge his ult with long range low dmg attacks , I like the first buff but a damage buff would make Leon op

Also Brock is kinda good imo he‚Äôs my second highest trophy brawler

I use a app and the railway can you set in the map

I wish that they made the spikes spawn further out so that  couldn‚Äôt hit 2 spikes on small hurtboxes, and wouldn‚Äôt always hit 2 on tanks

Thanks!

Yeah. So? Thats what it is.

Nothing, it‚Äôs just green

Nice. I remember loving whenever that happened and would purposely drop a few to hit it. Recently just passed 11111 but didn‚Äôt care to drop a few to get the pic.

including mortis because he is part of her family

I'm pretty sure everyone is trying their best to overcome this. However, I think this thread was started with the intention to bring this matter to light in hope that the dev team would see that it's not fun with this unfairness here.
---
I wanna commit mass genocide on supercell headquarters*

Read the description dummy. It says the first draws are predetermined to ensure that everyone has a fair start.
---
witch shelly is me when a bug walks on my shoes

Bruh almost winning is rated more than dominating? Power point reward should be less

#What monstrosity have you created?

He get buff 1million time on row  even me who is bad one brawl stars were managed to get him to rank25 as power7
---
Better than I could ever do
---
What‚Äôs with you and drawing noticeably big noses?
---
He once actually asked me if he could use a clip I posted but in the end I don‚Äôt think he even used it lol. Sad to those who didn‚Äôt get credit:(
---
Now why would the developers say th- ooohhhh, God, no.
---
When I play against Tick I get bombed to shit, when I play him I get shattered. I hate him so much

Tell ur friend that my bat says you‚Äôre incredible

Step 1. Hold Foot

Step 2. Insert foot into ass
---
What I would prefer for PowerPlay 3v3 team matches is to have complete random and no team ups. I had random teammates with low overall trophies of 3-6k (and their inexperience shows) vs teams with players of high overall trophies that were from the same club. 
---
I'd also rather if players with low overall trophies (as an indicator of 'newbieness' - which is not the best but close enough) are distributed evenly between teams in 3v3 matches. This way, no team can be "dominating" just because you have friends or club members that are good vs an almost complete newbie team.
---
If my memes or art get stolen with no credit I'll just coment if you will steal steal something good XD just kiding man pumbas a jerk
---
Thats epic lose
---
I swear to god every goddamn colt and piper in takedown have infinite supers and keep targeting you.
---
Ok boomer
---
Are you joking or?
---
Lol, I‚Äôm kidding. I just think you‚Äôll eventually get ‚Äòcrap‚Äô from people with 15,000 trophies and not a legendary to call home for.
---
Wtf is that title???
---
i'm not talking shit, youre saying ur stating ur opinion but ur suggesting a nerf, i dont want a shelly nerf, u can go around saying u think shelly is op, but don't tell supercell to nerf her
---
the last pic but an 8-bit is the goalie.
---
nah
---
That's a little stereotypical, isn't it?

It looks great you can just say Leon used his super

Ah yes this monstrosity XD

It's not feasible all the time (and not everyone is "blessed" to be in a great club). Try a more constructive suggestion.
---
hey they're probably a troll just ignore them
---
Power Play really showcases how stupid broken the matchmaking is in this game.
---
Congrats!! Btw how many trophies do you have?
---
:D

Kinda hard when I‚Äôm stuck behind a wall with a piper and 8-bit trying to kill me you know.

Always appreciate new kinds of content for this sub, its so new and refreshing to see something thats not a meme, just legit joy and entertainment of someone.

What did you see?

The matchmaking is intentionally broken to frustrate you in hopes that you end up buying things in the gem shop - it's like this in all of their games.

What Takedown? You mean Lone Star with Angry Robo?

Where can you watch pro brawl stars players?

sorry its just not really my thing

It should be a showdown modifier tbh

El primo disagrees
---
Yeah
---
Sad
---
Is alright, completelly understandable, i just offered that cuz losing trophies due to the matchmaking and not so experienced players truly is sad.

Good luck on your journey and on your grinding to victory! Just dont give up and brawl.

---
I hope u realized that leon is a human in a costume lol
---
i dunno, he doesn't seem that terrible, there's a chance that maybe he was just panicking or something- or just lag 
---
i've had way worse teammates than this where they just run in and immediately get killed over and over or just straight up are afk the entire game- if the wi-fi's bad wherever you are, use data or just don't play BS for god's sake 
---
at least you guys were eventually able to score
---
Ok, so click on the subreddit. Once on their page, tap/click on the top right with the three ... then there should be an option to change the user flair.

User flairs help make your comments n all unique. Displays on comments n all. A lot of sub Reddit‚Äôs have their own user flairs that you can pick from

Cool

Sorry for bad english ):

Please cut the clips..... it‚Äôs as simple as just trimming the video down in ur photo library

One thing I do agree with is improving training cave. An ideal thing would be to have a map editor you could use to make custom (or import) training cave maps

Nice try,we can see gedi kor's name

Amount of trophies doesn't determine skill, all amount of trophies shows is how much you play/played. So yea...

üòòüòòüòòüòçnice

I don't really care about who gets a legendary since it's just luck. For example i have 9k trophies and don't have pam while my friend got leon as his 3rd or 4th character.

r/userflairchecksout

How did you get that el primo label

Dont worry he's already dead from all the nerfs.

Me who actually got spike when I was at 6500 trophies
---
If it was a new brawler in your game... You were like:
---
Be my boyfriend :))) jk
---
next 2 weeks
---
Same idea as mine, but executed much more nicely. Good job!
---
Frickin patchy. I remember when he always obliterated me in beta when I was still a big ol noob. He made me think mortis was op and when I got him, I realized how hard (and bad) he really was.
---
I guess that's fair enough, so yea... btw f2p
---
Tbh this is going into nitpick scenario, because the game right now is pretty good , and isn‚Äôt supercell‚Äôs fault that people at 2000 trophies get legendaries
---
i think by for now he means they will add it back later
---
Good idea. Also slightly smaller maps wouldn‚Äôt hurt either
---
Haha, I kinda like this game mode cuz Emz with her 1st sp is so op on takedown. But yea, it can be very annoying when other players keep targeting you instead of the bot :/
---
Nice one!
---
Same

Gg

Really late like 1 month

Motis has had zero buffs latley so stop chatting shit

More like 24K-Bit
---
I hate GRAVEYARD shift as well as life leech
---
I am now on a 6 row winning streak. All of the matches played with randoms who were pretty good so i guess you are just unlucky.
---
Imagine calling it the epic lose
---
Look how they massacred my boy, Penny.
---
that graphics
---
The problem isn't the matchmaking imho.. is the possibility to play with a friend like that and people who actually do that
---
That sucks a lot man. Try to rebuild,  and be very careful about who you give vice. Being backstabbed like this must hurt so much man.
---
I love it, hope it comes to the game
---
Very cool
---
Thx
---
I'm not sure whether they are friends or not, but I've check their clan which are not the same. If it's the problem of friends, supercell should put a limit for trophies different like eg, not more than 50. It's pissing me off so much!!!!!

8700 is low man, I only got leon just tonight at 13k ish trophies, been playing since global
---
Shut up and take my upvote.
---
Wait, that's illegal
---
The big yellow circle is showing the turret range which would be really helpfull
---
the chances of getting a legendary can be the same for 2k players and 10k players, if you all play and get all your tokens everyday the amount of boxes opened should not be all that different.
---
Exactly. Why are people so lazy that they trade accounts?! They don't want to play, get or lose trophies. Then all the game pleasure disappears...
---
He is. Even without curveball he is really strong. Pros say he one of the strongest brawlers in the entire game (yes, even without curveball). Its your problem that you suck with him and dont know to to play him. Hes literally so easy to push I push him every season to 650 with no problems...youre just a big noob.
---
We also need this for EMZ‚Äôs super. I can‚Äôt just calculate or guess if I would hit the enemy or not.
---
Sadly they are friends is the only way it work that thing, they should deny those type of premades if they are only 2 ppl
---
He probably just took it from a top 10 video
---
Says a crow flair lol...im just saying the truth, anyone who thinks spike is bad, they suck or they have never played him to witness his strenght. Like you for example.
---
This gave me a "Heart attack in my kidneys''
---
Never done before
---
Wtf?
---
I have spike. I used to main him until I got crow, who is easily better than spike
---
I love this idea. Take my upvote!
---
Or when you have the Gems and are trying to hide and your teammates guide the enemies towards you.
---
Thank you... :)

Jeez how long did that lady full clip take

She didn‚Äôt look edgy originally, it‚Äôs impossible for someone like Jessie to look anything but adorable lmao
---
I never said he was bad, it's that leon is better for these modes. It's all personal preference
---
exactly
---
And a bot got star player over you......
---
Dude omg I feel the same way except both Barley star powers are in store!
---
Lmao. They kept walking into the energy balls...
---
Well thats your opinion. Pros still say spike is one of the best brawlers in the game and that crow is the weakest legendary. Crow is good in SD and lone star but not that good in 3v3.
---
I don‚Äôt play 3v3s
---
This is really cool and its sad that this didnt get seen more, but this is a good idea if brawl stars somehow ended in console
---
Also, teaming is a legitimate strategy. They don't wanna waste all of their resources telling people they're dumb for thinking teaming is a reportable offence.
---
That impossible
---
It is very true

AAD REPORT BUTTON!!!

one week ago i opened 100 boxes and got star powers and today that

I was also someone who got a Crow under 5K trophies. Now I'm about 10K and have every brawler except 3 legendaries. They'll get 1 legendary, but they'll be one of us.

nice

No, that Shelly is named Leon. Fortnite restored

Because of He is Neo from Matrix or enemy just to bad on aiming they shoot?

thanks i will use it to spam in my idiot ship group
---
Maybe one for lefty, one for righty
---
U get emz from the trophy road.... Its totally fake
---
He should be called BLING-BIT
---
I don't team. But like I said, Supercell has started several times that teaming is recognized as a strategy and in no way breaks the rules of the game. The reason there is no report button is because teaming is not a reportable offense. It is actually encouraged by brawlstars. I'm not trying to argue with a 9 year old before I've had my coffee. Have a wonderful day.

Be happy
---
You know what I think? He takes the most skill to play in higher trophies I fucking love the man! Because it s not so hard to play Spike s attack and ult so is about Crow and Sandy does not require skill at all just put sand on your eyes and play blind you still win
---
But Leon is way tooo predictive when he goes invisible it takes 9999+ iq and skill to trick opponents
---
Btw.....I don‚Äôt have Leon...... I‚Äôm crying üò¢

Nice accept the bat it should have been the normal bat in my opinion

I am a normal guy who has meme sense but I don‚Äôt know how to edit videos ( I am sad) can someone suggest me an app to edit videos.

I recommend you get spikes star power because they nerfed curveball too much and fertilize is better now.
---
Also some good material if you lagging
---
Umm... I didn't even noticed that :D
---
Yeah I realized it now, sorry
---
deletefd

Buff it so that higher trophy players also find it easier to get them

Maybe he‚Äôll be immortal since he can‚Äôt get invisible by then

---
I like how the one on the bottom right has the eyes of the skull in the brawl stars logo 
---
and is the blue one supposed to be ricochet or the sniper minion?
---
It was perfect I can‚Äôt stop laughing every time I see this post

Why does't it get lower? Doesn't it go higher since you unlock brawlers as you go up in trophies

Nooooo! I personally think that the battle pass in clash royal "kill" the game, it's unfair for  free players....
---
I really hope it won't happen for brawl star
---
It‚Äôs because his other two teammates were/are terrible as hell!! I can‚Äôt blame him for doing what he did.

Sorry Spike, I didn't hear that

I feel the rant dude.
---
how can anyone say she needs a buff?
---
Her regular attack lingers. Her health is on the higher side and her super goes under walls slows you down and damages you at the same time.
---
And it lasts for 5 seconds? That‚Äôs a long time given it takes 200 damage while it slows you down. When most games last only 2 minutes and responding takes 5 seconds anyway.

Well fuck it I‚Äôm gonna use Poco but in my low trophy account

I think that Shelly just destroyed her phone
---
Idc if you want to "look cool" BUT please, play alone/solo (in SD, LS or Takedown) and please get 10th place every game..
---
Please make another post when you get zero trophy and tell us, how "cool" is that..
---
There‚Äôs no actual point to being in a league first of all. Maybe they should make them have a meaning before adding more.
---
Pues aprende al igual que yo invecil

I have it and yes it's amazing. Everyone who says that Supercell skins suck can eat a dick.

i have 86 so i can't buy it

Ok then, keep your secrets

Just play in private servers and you‚Äôll earn nita from boxes

Sorry bro, but your type is the teamer gang, not ours...

I got leon at 3500 Trophies and it was my first not-rare character, after three months i get tara at 6500 trophies then i get frank at 7000,Bibi at 9500, gene and pam at 9700 trophies

How many brawlers you have?

If you want to get more tokens, why wouldn‚Äôt you play her?

tbh the turrets range has more attack range. just saying nerf jessie

But I've asked my friend if I can use it

Is it okay if i use it to make a meme?

They had a survey a while ago... I never heard of it being in game files tho.

I haven‚Äôt played on it for more than a month btw

Leagues would be worth it if you were actually guaranteed to play people in your league. Rather than getting matched with teammates below your own league. Seems the league system is pointless if the match making never gets addressed.

This is fake,you can get Emz in a boxüëé

I'm only 8.5k because I don't play a lot

Yes, by looking at the top middle of your screen. It should be a brawl tv logo next to the spectate thing.

Hold Up. Leon is too young but Sandy Isn't?

Great! I'll make sure to give template credit (hope the meme won't fail)

I only play on this account now. but FK I DON'T HAVE STAR SHELLY ON THIS ONE

when and where?

They are just joking. That sub is joke (yes I know, a terrible one), but still in reality spike just adorable and only wants to hug...but cant because hes a  cactus..poor spike :(

Not to be mean, but its your fault you pronoted him

Me but after opening 300+ Boxes(Which meant at least 3 Star Powers) I got none while having over 7 brawlers available to get em
---
I feel burnt out on Brawlstars, I visit other games, the top 3 that I recommend are Speedy Gunfire, Zooba, and West Legends. Arma Jet looks fun but I haven't had much time to play it.

You know, by then you could have gotten at least 1 legendary if you saved your gems.
---
Haha you got a legy at 2k

Their problem then. Or maybe you are at specific trophy range where people have no clue how to play the game...in reality carl should beat leon in almost all situations.

Don‚Äôt take it, the brawl stars cactus has drugged oh god oh fuck watch out Jessie noooo
---
Well, if your complaining about being a beta player and no legendaries, PROVE that you played 2 years, PROVE that you have tons of trophies. Also if you have been playing for the long, just save gems to buy a legendaries. I had no legendaries and was a beta player, so I just bought legendaries. PROVE that you have no legendaries. Also it is their choice. Sc can do what they want. What about power play, a PURELY competitive game mode. Prove your point. 
---
1. Game doesn‚Äôt support competitive play
---
Supercell made power play to make competitive players happy as its way less grinds.
---
2. P2W
---
Get it, also am a f2p, power 1 vs 10 is a 45% difference, and because levels 1-5 are trivial to get, it‚Äôs effectively a 20% skill gap, I got 500 power 1 piper. Recently there are as much trophy road brawlers as ever. Their trying to make the game as less p2w as possible while making money.
---
3. No legendary at (insert trophies here.)
---
Save gems and buy it. Legendaries are purely lucked based so safest option is to save gems. They have to make money somehow.
---
Also how does this have anything to do with the post?
---
LmaoüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Darryl: *intense staring*
---
Maybe, but this is just 90% of showdown in a nutshell
---
Yes it is

thanks

That‚Äôs the most illegal thing that you have

I know this is 2 months old but don't be rude like that. Who are you to talk to people like that?

That was sloppy all around from everyone

No it's based on real life weapon s

What kind of book is that?

Im not blaming you im just saying that im tired of seeing only jessies in that mode

The guy with the "Camera" is me

Because he was jealous of his *fire* play

Oh.

Didn‚Äôt mean to lol

She was so suspiciosly confident and just kept running forward as if she knew pipers super wont do dmg to her...

What do you mean my friend said he got emz at 1k trophies from a box (that's what he told me)

You‚Äôll probably get one soon. I just got lucky...
---
i\`ve gotten all rarities in order have 2 mythics to get and no legendaries at 7k

I think its because you sounded like you thought the play was bad

1. Sorry for bad quality
---
2. There are no brawlers newer than Bibi
---
3. It was from Tiermaker but I had to make a screenshot 
---
4. I'm not that skilled so brawlers like Poco, Mortis, Gene or Colt are not easy to play for me.
---
Genial.
---
I had Level 69 with 420 XP once
---
This deserves more upvotes
---
Like the concept, fits the theme
---
Cark in D? Seriously?
---
Bro but why did Skyrix left the band ;(
---
Bibi is not D tier imo
---
This could be so lethal imo! However, I think it only would be very good at lower trophy ranges, like the Shocky SP. Good players will be able to keep their distance of Bruce while killing him, I guess...
---
Everyone, credit to u/TheRedditN00B1 for this post
---
I have brawl stats, but i get my infos from playing those brawlers myself, sure there are good win and use rates for leon, but just from people who have a star power for him, without star power, he is damn bad
---
Just to clarify. I am the El primo in this match, not the scummy Bull.
---
Crow was never bad, you just had to know how to use him, now he's super easy
---
Ahublalalalabalablaha
---
Poco has no dick, is a skeleton
---
You kinda got really close to her in the beginning.
---
OP, but ok bc i have maxed nita

oh cmon there's plenty to look forward to. like your first legendary
---
This is so wrong it‚Äôs funny

r/ihadastroke

F*** me for the win!

She also says this!

there isnt such things as e tiers

Im the Primo not the Bull

Sry bro wow chill
---
it was 1 month ago and i dont how you found this, but i agree
---
I managed to pass through insane 4 with randomes, but i think for everything further, you need a team to have a reliable comp
---
Don't forget daily quests...
---
I am still not the Bull.
---
the 15000, 20000, 25000 trophy emblem is kinda based on emz...
---
#ok#
---
Darryls also not in it
---
I dont have Bibi so I dont have experience but she was nerfed and I don't like that type of brawlers
---
If u want to see me how i drew nita go check out on youtube https://youtu.be/4EGDBZOuyNI
---
More leagues = More free rewards = less money for Supercell
---
Ight imma head out
---
cause the ball will get stuck in the water and will take too much time to get through it that's why they removed water from brawl ball
---
Yeah the tokens were great, I dont get why we can't have them and star tokens
---
Imagine same trophies, same power level and color !
---
Firstly no. ‚ÄúCute couple‚Äù wft man. Secondly, couple, in any way, automatically means ‚Äúsexual relationship‚Äù. It means that there are some something, a pair. In what world do you live in to think a couple indicates something sexual?
---
Thirdly, no. Bold of you to assume I would spend my time going through a fake account just to downvote you. I have more to do on a daily basis than debating on the internet.
---
But you came up with the idea of downvote. Do *you* do that? Better not answer.
---
nice artstyle dude
---
*I have several questions*
---
Shelly shell (see what I did here?) be with Bull
---
Storage would go up but games like pubg mobile or call of duty mobile exists so its not that big of a deal...
---
Compared to the last one, this one is a major improvement.
---
Take my downvote
---
no
---
Very interesting question, the only thing I know is that they had to create a totally new model to make a skin, however now they only need to add new textures onto the default model. Sorry if this wasn't much of a help.
---
They're old icons from the old upgrade system from beta
---
Wait that piper
---
I would call it scratchy scratching :)
---
That's what this post is about
---
Ok.
---
Why?
---
I think they're from the old upgrade system from beta
---
One is attack, one is health, one is super damage
---
Plenty of reason to push. Go for higher ranks on your brawlers-- there are 35 ranks now and most people don't even have a single rank 30.
---
Same üòî

The amount of grammatical mistakes are driving me mad.

I am guessing you bought him

she has a bee as her pet/turret
---
I have crazy luck with brawlers! I just got Sandy after not playing for a few weeks. I now have every brawlers in the game!
---
He didn't beg all he said was to like it *IF* you liked it
---
The odds of pulling a star power is 1%. You also need a brawler at lvl 9.
---
Well no matter what, the chance of getting a star power is at least 1. It can be a bit more
---
Lets pretend Jessie dont show her hair

you don't know how to write

Hol up
