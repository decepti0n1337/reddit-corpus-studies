well yes but it looks fun to play

Oh thank God

I have total &gt;!6!&lt; brawlers on 500 trophies, all of them are lvl 1 expect colt, that i upgraded accidentally.
---
Well you got on legal ways, right?
---
In that zoomed in picture I saw for first time that picture of El primo in the left bottom ü§£üòÇ
---
Well I guess... it‚Äôs basically siege with no robot

I just realised that my first girlfriend's name was Bea, in my country Bea is pronounced "Beea"

Not gonna happen

Oh my, so cute!! üêù

everyone forgot the fact that she is the second brawler with 1 ammo and carl is no longer the only brawler with 1 ammo
---
Max is not even out yet, let's wait before complaining.
---
&gt;Crow's trailer voice just sound too... generic?
---
YES THANKS FOR SAYING THIS OH MY GOD IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR SOMEONE TO POINT THIS OUT THANK YOU
---
It took too long otherwise
---
Hmm yeah I understand that not everyone wants a battle pass. If you‚Äôre poor or not that interested it‚Äôs a lot of money, but not having it lets you miss out on so much.
---
Supercell has done a lot. I‚Äôve been saving up boxes since Emz and I have more than 300, without spending any money. You get a lot more starkeys than about a year ago. I also like lootboxes myself. but it‚Äôs just gambling. 
---
Supercell is so good at monetizing but no one ever stops to think if that‚Äôs really a good thing.
---
Like, clash of clans and clash royale had some insane ‚Äòwhale players‚Äô that would spend tens of thousands of dollars on multiple accounts. Lets not forget the 500.000 gem tournaments in clash royale when 14.000 gems cost 110 ‚Ç¨
---
In clash royale they went full lootbox and they made so much money with it (can‚Äôt find a link but def look it up). Now they‚Äôre switching to battle passes and cosmetics. Their games are great, but if everyone just paid 5 euros they‚Äôd already have enough money.

I just want bounty more frequently

Yeah I was looking at my comment afterwards and was sceptical if I should edit it or not,but then I thought that nobody was gonna notice.
---
Seems I was wrong,oh well.Now onto the real reason I‚Äôm typing,I do admit that it‚Äôs not your fault that 1,7k people decided to upvote your post.Oh,and another thing I wasn‚Äôt trying to get you banned I was just,as you said,giving my own opinion on your post.Hope all goes well for you in the future.
---
[deleted]
---
Yeaa but with lonestar i can see why people wanna camp nd kill you but with takedown, the whole point is to do damage to the robot, but i still have people shooting me when the robot is like right there
---
Idk maybe a skin like colt's would work on him where he shoots cannonballs
---
Wattson is infinte times cute-er!  But i can sea it. Get it coz wattson puns alot..
---
That wasn‚Äôt your own opinion, that was 10% of the people who saw this post‚Äôs opinion
---
I love siege! Dont even bother getting the one win from lone star and takedown though
---
xD i never though of that
---
Thanks for the perfect example. I hate it.
---
20$ to matchmaking
---
What is your gameplan around powercubes?
---
Read the description of a big or mega box (same).
---
Its say that if you got for exemple, a rare brawler, its only your rare brawler % who drop, not the rest
---
imagine if the primo card acts as a "no u"
---
Is max a girl?
---
If anything that ahows the opposite. The community could have petitioned it, but I'm guessing that actual play percentage is what resulted in it being removed.
---
To bad ticks aren‚Äôt insects
---
Honestly, who cares if it‚Äôs full of Shelly. It just makes it easier for me if i know my opponents brawlers beforehand. It‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs some kind of uncounterable god mode brawler.
---
Agreed.
---
Now that brawl ball is permanent, the number of idiots playing brawl ball is about 1/3 of all randoms. Also brawl ball has the most people giving up after one goal.
---
Siege's gameplay is more enforced, meaning that when its time to collect bolts, then everyone focuses on getting bolts (unless you are penny with super). When its time to attack the enemy safe, everyone focuses on that. Whereas in brawl ball when its time to defend the goal, Shelly is on the other side of the map trying to kill brock, while the enemy primo walks the ball in.
---
So where is it
---
How do u know BEA is a Epic
---
I don't know why I'm getting downvoted

you haven't even played it yet

"Grass is my name, housing bulls is my name"

---
Super-cool idea man! Love the idea of an alien theme which could be reeaally fun. If you want to get your idea out there I would recommend designing a visual version even if it's on sketch paper
---
I was replying with the mindset that the gift would cost gems.
---
Oh wait you do have to pay the gems!

From this picture you can tell that Supercell is a logical and intellectual game company.

What‚Äôs the YouTuber‚Äôs name?

Thanks

It's great  it's better then what I do
---
That‚Äôs true
---
Agreed
---
Why a FIFTH epic?!?!?!?!!??!?!
---
Bruh
---
It's the same picture what so you mean
---
It wasn‚Äôt confirmed. In the video he said he thought it might be, he also thinks bea could be a rare since Rosa is a rare. But they probably are a mythic and an epic.
---
Poor bull
---
Maybe the grass should be green because well... the ground would probably be fertile üòÄ
---
Hol up
---
I was thinking the same thing
---
didn't like brawler designs cause they look rushed or don't fit brawlstars.feels that Christmas shouldn't be replaced by pirate update. no remodel no voiceover announced.  nothing big  added in update like clan war or whatever.  etc.
---
But worse
---
CrOw
---
I miss ricachet
---
I think they're just testing out the concept before making it permanent.  Capture the Flag and BrawlStars are like made for each other, but there's a lot of mechanics that could potentially be unbalanced.  It could easily accidentally be made into a game mode that lasts 10 minutes, for example.  It looks like they're taking the right approach for the mode so far.
---
Lone Star and Takedown are flawed because the maps are too big. So people spend over half the game trying to find people / trying to get to the boss, which is super frustrating because usually U die right after you get there
---
Sad Rosa Noises\*

you really won‚Äôt get an epic? Lol

Yeah that makes more sense, since Bea is more skill-based. But I guess this must be true, Lex had it photoshopped in the video

Thx

facts

Not really clash of clans isnt pay to win
---
1. Spending money doesnt make you good its just make you advance faster
---
2.They are no special characters that are only availble by using real money
---
Clash of clans is more of a pay to progress game you spend money you progress faster.
---
I suggest you actually search what exactly pay to win  means in the internet kid.
---
This deserves more upvotes.
---
awkward
---
No, I got El-Primo
---
Selling?
---
throw.... wow
---
If they dont make money how will they keep the game alive?
---
Yup
---
Well I hope you get banned
---
This entire thread is opinionated
---
That is the side effect of maxing the game
---
Yes, this is based off the book "a christmas carol", which the ghost and scrooge is based off of
---
I think Max is gonna be put with 8-bit, making a brand new section in the brawl stars universe
---
Sure use it
---
i do. i understand some people aren't satisfied with update. but he is replying directly to community managers rudely. he can state his opinion in a separate thread or post or comment, not like this. it's like demanding free legendaries and tagging their twitter/reddit accounts.
---
Im f2p
---
Its just weed plantation
---
Go tp YouTube.
---
watch brawl talk
---
but it's true
---
Omega Flowey vs Rosa with shield
---
Professionals have STANDARDS. Be polite, be efficient, have a plan to kill every one you meet.
---
Supercell has said many times that brawlball is one of the favorite modes and most played,  compared to seige and heist which are significantly lower.
---
I literally have 750 upvotes on my post. I think I'm right

God, forgive me for what I will do ...

I think the main problem in Takedown is that the robot doesn't have enough health, so if you die and respawn far away, people will destroy the boss before you even catch up to it. 
---
But apart from that, I think Takedown is pretty decent. Just use the highest dps brawlers (Colt, Bull, Darryl) and concentrate ONLY on attacking the boss, ignore everyone else and only attack if they attack first.
---
On the other hand, I completely despise Lone Star. You are pretty much chasing players through the whole match and getting your kills stolen by a random Leon/Piper/Mortis. The respawn time is also too long, it should be just like Bounty.
---
Idk man I got him to rank 10 pretty easily in solo showdown
---
Oyur mean
---
Yeah yeah ik now
---
Small Brain
---
this is not a showdown type map also there are to many 1 tile gaps they don't work good and will niet come in the game. For the rest a good map

https://youtu.be/hjLnumwI0nY
---
Here is all leaks of new update.
---
I know i was like there is something wrong and then I posted it anyway
---
I don't see how it is "rude". Its not like he threatened to kill them or anything. He was just disappointed. Even I am too. But since the update hasn't dropped yet I will wait.
---
That Gene was horrible, he can just let Nita or Tick grab those gems and then pull them. Let enemies grab the gem and then pull them is a very good strategy when using Gene.
---
from what i gathered from brawltalk you can only throw present with super...possibly only way to pass it
---
Has to be fake, I‚Äôve never even seen a pro player get a Power 1 that high.
---
Lmfao
---
I'm just hoping he has no brain so he post this, or sader version is he has no friends to show this to them.(then i gry a milestone in Brawl Stars i show it to my friend not to +200k people on Reddit who don't care)
---
Her hyper ness wakes sandy up. He does not like it at first, but he appreciates it in the end since he actually gets stuff done then

I had friend and they wouldn‚Äôt care at all about anything dealing with this game. So it‚Äôs a good idea to show it to people that actually play the game. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Should, but who knows if it will

I like what you‚Äôre thinking, I‚Äôll sketch a little brawler concept up and send it to you

Ikr like why didn‚Äôt they just do another Christmas update

He does stuff when he wants too
---
Yeah exactly

Yde is a beast. But Mortis does suck for most players in Heist and Brawl Ball, wish people would stop using him.

I don't have Piper . _.

Swap the pictures, then add ‚Äúat 700+ trophies‚Äù to the Takedown text.
---
Ill gift Pink Piper
---
I can‚Äôt wait to see the rest!
---
Yh but that require less self harm
---
Ohh I see
---
It‚Äôs boring without self harm
---
That time really 100 coins

No gifting star point skins since star points are exclusively to only obtain by skill and playing

where‚Äôs bibi @
---
Extra beeload is like 8-bit's extra life in bounty. Not gonna be too great
---
Did people got confused by Bibi?
---
Not funny. Trying too hard
---
Pam + skin !
---
I'm not here to look someone getting 10k but something cool for example:memes, ideas, plays and i like if someone post not"OMG i'm do good i get 30 rank with power 10" but once i saw guy who get 1000 with power 1 crow and it's cool.
---
And many people say:I know it's not that hard but still i'm proud of myself. And I still can't undarstand do why they post this?
---
Ill gift calavera piper
---
Okay can you gift it [here?](https://youtu.be/sAn7baRbhx4)
---
I dont trust that link. Instead have my credit card number
---
Hehe ^^
---
i never really got confused cuz i knew bibi was a girl from the voice lines, but in my mind i see bibi as a guy. even the profile icon of bibi looks so much like a male
---
Pledge to protect.
---
She is more of a black/yellow piper not Pink but ye thats okay
---
Is black a problem
---
Got one of these for max ?
---
From what game is this. Cuz yu obviously didnt make this yourself
---
Absolutly. Do that!
---
Good luck having your account MAX!
---
rosa&amp;bea:why do I hear boss music?
---
This means you have a Hard time getting trophies. Hmm... You lose a lot if you maxed everything under 10k.

No I just mean the rocket is not hard it looks like a soft rocket
---
I mean why is the rocket soft

wow they‚Äôre pretty good

Max icon looks like el primo ü§£

Everyone is scared to go to the middle in showdown.
---
I used Robo Retreat and SLick Boots onto 8bit. Man, was that Arcade Machine going fast.
---
What are the other brawlers?
---
Its like minecraft
---
And Leon buff, Pam remodel, Rosa skin, Bibi skin, Tick skin, Emz skin, Spike's voice and lonestar and takedown reworks
---
I dreamt up that there was a champ that was magnetic and shit and would be particularly good against teammers 
---
His super would be similar to Taras in that it would push two opponents that were close together to smack each other and deal damage to both
---
His attack would be summoning little zap towers to deal damage (these towers you can also use to bump into opponents with the super.

Yeah the only gems. Could‚Äôve bought coins and mega boxes

so true, solo mode are so bullshit !!

2/10 for the mortis

Not new
---
Don't worry!! Winter themed update will come in January as they had done beforeüòâ
---
When is the New update?
---
F√∂r some month ago i got a Mike combo. Out of the 19 games we played together we got to the first place 15 times. It was very fun!
---
I actually really dig it. Very 'toony.
---
My guess is on Wednesday
---
I'm free to play and I have all brawlers lvl 10 but I don't have sandy
---
It's really cool because its rare!
---
Shouldn‚Äôt the star power be 8-BIT‚Äôs 1UP?
---
P.S i know how the Dead Ringer works, and surprisingly there are quite a number of BS players who played TF2
---
from where did you got the info??
---
Could be some sort of wierd ship growth
---
i do, if the update drops today or tomorrow we could be lucky :)
---
they played together probably and your matchmaking is based on brawler not total trophies
---
Me too i pushed a lot emz on takedown
---
üòÄThank
---
Smoke trail hmmmm
---
Wait... it is even possible to get 20 gems?
---
Christmas time üòÅ
---
good idea
---
Didn't know it also.
---
Weeeee neeeed IT!!
---
From this box I got nita's second star power
---
From when I started the game and now I have 8865 trphs I opened so many Mb and never got 20 gems
---
Solaris....i was joking
---
I think Leon should be at the top, he must be using some sort of chemical potion to turn invisible
---
Me neither, and im standing at 15k, play since january 1st. And this wasnt in a mb, it was in the purple one, the big box.
---
1%
---
Its more like the new bea star power.
---
Oh well thats even more rare or this is fake (im just sayin' :/ )
---
Photoshopped
---
F for Leon
---
Eh, fair enough
---
Yeah of course, that is already with buying 4 star powers from the shop in the meantime, otherwise I'd be waiting for 27. I meant 90 days since I got one from a box.
---
i know
---
Those guys in the middle top and bottom are f*cked up.
---
Yeah i got 2 firt places thanks to bo :D  .
---
I always get a mf Piper in my team
---
I do, the game is fun.
---
But the goal in this game is to get all the brawlers and get the star power and others.
---
You sure its better? I already have 59 tickets
---
This post is so underrated
---
Yeah me too
---
But if we're lucky, they'll arrive tomorrow
---
What brawlers do you miss?
---
She is epic?
---
Yeah, I agree
---
Save for 1 year??
---
Go to the shop, click the box, click "i", there will be your odds to get oneüòÅ
---
And you still miss leon, am I right?
---
Depends
---
It will be on January
---
üòëI am not Russian . I dont live in Russia.

I question its sexuality

You Must Be The Dumbest Person Alive

mort.. forget it, why would we use him in takedown

if you don't want star skins

I made it derpy because i dont want to people think i got the new enviroment

Bea is just Piper, but good in brawl ball.

here if u wanna
---
Ah, okay, yeah, it's because Brock's Rocket actually looks like this, though I could make it more... Spiky
---
Kairos did something based on statistics collected from brawlstats. But I agree that some brawlers are completly different without starpower (poor) and would be nice to see a tierlist based on lvl 1 ~ 7 brawlers.
---
here
---
spike should be golden S
---
Shitty photoshop, omg
---
Actually, I see this as a work of art
---
Nope.. He use Rico 2nd SP :)
---
Now I know , I we all have immunity shield , the attack from boss does nothing
---
No they are SO different. Their supers are different, Bea has 1 ammo bar versus 3, their reload speed is different, the attack mechanics are different. The only similarity is health and range

Ok, I think I'm gonna do one like that as well

I got Sandy from a normal box a few hours ago.
---
Yea 100% with you. Love the update but I just can't get out of my head that they could have done something more impressive with their designs. Especially Beas. Imagine if they had made a full on wasp or bee, that could have been cool.
---
old curveball spike = golden s tier
---
Beta player
---
But don‚Äôt Bea and Gene share a (somewhat) similar mechanic with their main attack splitting, this allowing her to hit multiple people?
---
*insert hacker picture*
---
I mean in the art it says two new brawlers is coming so *Are
---
Robo Retreat 8bit. You can do the same with Slick Boots. You will feel him going faster significantly. Slick Boots Mortis also works, and it's pretty damn fast.
---
What splits is bea's super not her main attack
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=E-gPzhZvBDU&amp;t=483s
---
Probably she teamed with the other player
---
He likely played before common brawlers were available from trophy road, and pulled them from boxes
---
just wait for the update to see the improved matchmaking
---
This is... Magnificent
---
Gracias man
---
You can't be so sure. Brawl Talk didn't show her attacking brawlers in clusters. Just sayin'
---
I thought Max was a guy: /
---
–Ø –¥—É–º–∞–ª —á—Ç–æ –ú–∞–∫—Å —ç—Ç–æ –ø–∞—Ä–µ–Ω—å :/
---
Depends if you really want that skins
---
If not you can buy them
---
Did they say the presents spawn randomly on the map ? From the video I thought it always spawned at the centre of your and enemy bases
---
Am I the only one that doesn't care about getting the new brawlers, but knowing how to counter them, so I can still continue to push my rank 27 Mortis and rank 25 Bo without hindrance?
---
He did get, just wait the update arrive
---
Damn awesome. Btw, I love your lewd pics
---
i heard they will give a free skin on the 24th? i don't know if it's fake or not but it will be a good present
---
I don‚Äôt play siege much, I have never got a draw in that, just a ton of losses, but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs possible
---
Ya I am just just interested the new update matchmaking change.I am not exited to the new brawler and skin actually....
---
Camel toe
---
Not sure, I don‚Äôt play siege that much, think you can tho
---
Yeah, you're right. Like, some YouTubers r sitting on 100k gold and saying having no uses for it while I'm like, struggling to upgrade my 22 brawlers to level 7 and 8.
---
I seen another video on here a while back. It‚Äôs just pure luck. Very small window.
---
r/cursedcomments
---
Mortis would like to know your location
---
Yes please!!
---
r/lootstars
---
Go to the content support and chose lost account they gonna ask you some questions and then you will have to put the account in another supercell ID and thats it i did it with two accounts and it worked
---
You are like, ultra kickass bro
---
nerf? are you okay?
---
yeah, her actual model has a very bland expression.
---
What?
---
Max/Alex/Jessie are pretty much gender neutral names... So it isn't that confusing, Sandy didn't confuse me either, he looked like a guy and the creators saying he's guy was more than enough for me
---
Apparently the can't go through walls is a bug that even happens with bots in friendly battles now. I really don't think they would rework him like that, he's one of the most polished brawlers in my opinion. Just nerf da capo to 600 and we're good
---
Sandy is also gender neutral, from what I can tell
---
But why would you post this? My poor brain cells...
---
they did this offer a while ago, i bought it but then i regretted bc i don't like how his clothes and accessories look. but love that hair.
---
Yeahhh, but from kairos's videos, he labels non-competitive as below 600 trophies, which is like, literally all my brawlers. So even then, that tier list is not helpful.
---
Wait I know sandy Is a boy but what gender is max?
---
Cripple
---
Aight I'm out
---
Most youtubers have second accounts that have very little star powers so they should be able to comment on gameplay without star power
---
isn't it wierd that they didn't released any sneak peeks till now?
---
Emoji police
---
Okay!
---
That's the 8bit I knowüòâ
---
Someone made it before.
---
now serious, her 2nd star power is going to be op, ngl
---
Bruh üò°üò°üò°
---
There's only Leon, Shark Leon, Werewolf Leon, And Sally Leon.
---
why tf do I not have this offer
---
they're gonna release sometime today and tomorrow probably and the update on wednesday.
---
Monarchy bad

WHAAT......I got.......coins..,.that's it

All skins, even exclusive ones. No losing trophies even if you lose. Double trophies gaining. 10k tickets.

Fuck
---
Then why did you post it
---
He is speaking the language of god
---
oh man I thought it was a cow when I looked at the skin
---
Got Tara and Sandy in the past 4 days. Level 100, only 2 more mythics and 3 more legendaries to go...
---
Damn i got 10.1k with 20 brawlers 1 epic no mythic/legendary
---
Yes
---
Put Rico head on him
---
fEeL oLd YeT?
---
Dude he‚Äôs the last one I need
---
I have a .3301 chance to get sandy, my last one, but I don‚Äôt even wanna open my boxes because of the two new brawlers coming out
---
No
---
did rosa create spike?
---
Congrats! I only have Sandy ;-;
---
Funny idea
---
you don't even have enough powerpoints for megabox
---
I think screeching solo is good as it is now
---
not if you have unlock a brawler
---
Or #MAXIMUN OVERDRIVE!!!!
---
About Pam's star power, do the friendly brawlers get the shield immediately? That's quite op if that's the case. Maybe make the shield charge up over time like hp.
---
Frank's attack speed boost is scary, I like how you named Poco's star power. 
---
Lower Spike's radius a tiny bit, his super is already wide enough in my opinion. Got stuck in that thing countless times already.
---
Nice ideas though. I really like the other star powers, especially the camera zoom out. Piper's shot can't be aimed properly if you aim it straight up or down, so that's probably necessary
---
Yeet
---
First thing I thought of
---
R/bonehurtingjuice
---
Not really. She only does like 1230 with all shots connecting, and she has some spread
---
Nice.
---
Thank you for your insightful contribution that added absolutely nothing to the argument at hand.
---
Have a good day.
---
I don‚Äôt know why people keep ignoring this, wizard barley, red wizard barley, golden barley, bake sale barley, and maple barley
---
That‚Äôs a lie if it‚Äôs a big box the coins are usually less than 20 if ur gonna get something, it‚Äôs probably a mega box
---
Dont worry dude! You'll get 'em soon
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-k2QYvhcjk
---
Thanks man. I Appreciate you
---
I'm getting a lot of feedback for Pam's, I think that it's the kind of power that would need to be community tested and reworked a few times to get right. And I might be underestimating the power of even a small shield.
---
Are your sure about that?
---
El Primo is Ricardo Milos' son
---
ok.
---
Stay hopeful!
---
This  post hits the line between cuteness and curse

I'm not good at English so does Bea's second star power makes her escape with 1 hp once a game?

Got crow at 3-4k and leon at 14k xd
---
Nah it's 1940's and we should get ready to be deployed
---
stop complaining if you got sandy and 29/30.
---
It's so tiny it doesn't exist
---
Yes. The game wasn't flooted by Bibi when she was released
---
The Jessie and the Sandy were teaming up
---
Jesus, I dont care if you dont believe, its the true.

Probably wednesday

No one exists. We are all living in a simulation where we are also simulations

Guys, i'm sha-
---
Well yes, but actually no
---
I opened 100 of my saved boxes and got nothing and my legendary chances didn't change smh
---
Someone link an anime song that fits with this picture
---
What u don‚Äôt realize is that I‚Äôve been playing super consistently ever since the game went global, getting three legendaries was to be expected because of how the game works.
---
#Now!? what!? I mean... What um uh üò´
---
I mean the popular BS youtubers
---
That's some good luck right there, congrats. I'm still missing Leon since the past year lol.
---
Oh no
---
no, because if they changed their name, the game would not end immediately after the player had died.
---
Bare witness to my thickness
---
Undertaker streak
---
**bot 8 IS a bot: because if they changed their name, the game would not end immediately after the player had died.**
---
Only 13?
---
nope unlike 8bit she will get the 1hp shield again even after getting defeated
---
Its's very funny for me because a got the Crow today.
---
I am so mad I really tought I would get atleast a starpower and now I see this shit
---
my legendary chances before update: 0%
---
its wendsday my dudes
---
That no one watches. Yeah this big brain time
---
Yeah that because I already have close to 16 because I needed up buying them from the shop for coins that I had saved up
---
I think its good for them to make it a limited time game mode and see if people will actually like it before making it a permanent game mode. Everyone was hyped about lone star and take down till they were actually in the game.
---
huh penny ia not annoying at all
---
Well I guess that's how coronations work, almost no one can say it's weird cuz we never witnessed a real coronation lol
---
hahahahah

Thank you! I love to try draw something new, sharing the work is a part of of that enjoyment!

Obvious plot to make me look more stupid to people cause you are the popular one and i am the loser in the situation cause you can't apperently accept other people's opinions‚Ñ¢.

What's your trophies count
---
I just got Spike, my first legendary, from the free big box. I‚Äôm at ~9500 trophies and nearly had a heart attack because I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything good. I was contemplating spending my 4000 star tokens on boxes, but now I won‚Äôt bother!
---
again..
---
i telling you. opinion not work every time
---
if you're wrong get downvote .. that's it..
---
not make you stupid if you say yourself a stupid
---
hmm yes, it's very sexual
---
Quite!
---
Although the mega box caused that to happen, since opening mega boxes with no brawlers in it increases your chances to get a new brawler drastically
---
4876
---
I can't understand your broken english.
---
But I made it on phone and it took so much dear Moderator
---
Pretty happy with the Bea drawing I've been seeing through today!
---
Well, she was Star Player
---
Yeah ok ,what about Brock ??
---
Sad spike
---
Supercell will probably listen to us but will probably make some stupid goal like ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll make Graveyard Shift and Present Plunder permanent if we get 10,000,000 subscribers on our YT channel‚Äù
---
ok i will make you understand.
---
Opinion is not gonna work.
---
If your opinion like disagree by other people...
---
 That's it you will get downvote..
---
Im sorry im not English ..
---
Started when android release came out and still no legendaries which I can be proud of. The new brawlers are gonna frick up my luck.
---
Brock has splash damage. If his enemies are too close the rocket will deal damage to all of them
---
wheres the free megabox? when did it comeout i think i missed it ;(
---
What about meteor rush?
---
It's ok. I just don't really like narrow-minded people. Sorry, Durian.

For kill stealers maybe. I only stealed 1 kill in this game

Finally something Christian on this subreddit

Is this your highest tho
---
I don't remember
---
That‚Äôs a 400 trophy gain right there
---
When I didnt have Pam, I used Poco.
---
It was from bulgarian youtuber and that video take down,so probably yes
---
Nvm 27 is pretty decent
---
Welcome aboard!
---
This made me lol in public lmfao this is gold
---
supercell where's the battle pass why the game is already so exhilarating just to play because you release a temporary game mode every update just comes skin brawler new theme and etc Every time and this the game is already sick because you do not improve it
---
Mortis got a crack on it after a match and Colt is checking if it's fine
---
11 Power Points on Jessie? How lucky are you?
---
BuT tHaTs JuSt ThE dEfAuLt GeNe

at least better than mortis

How did he get Bea and Max?

It looks amazing! Great work!

Sh*t i would have bought it butvi wanna buy corsair colt btw im f2p
---
Sandy is o boy and Max might be a woman idk
---
no
---
Sure it's worth it. They even added a second income of star points through power play so you should be getting progressively more the longer you play
---
as I said its based on brawler
---
The option to report is necessary, but not in this case. I feel like football mode is more reportable. I've play arround three games where one of the players gamethrows!! Is annoying.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing a short bit if character lore on the brawler info page.
---
its based off if trophies
---
Are you not concerned that this sub has so many cringy members and low effort posts?
---
She is

There are already Christmas maps in the game, they just haven‚Äôt been re-released. But they should

Congratulations!

Cus you where the people closest to them and always getting yourself stuck inbetween 2 teams

prob leon speed
---
I've tried doing this on 3 different occasions. Every time, the video gets far fewer views &amp; people don't watch it for as long. I'm not sure why because the info is very good.
---
Unfortunately, I can't spend time making videos that people don't watch because YouTube is my business. At least to some extent, I need to create content that people are interested in, and fewer people are interested in non-competitive Tier Lists
---
If you want so much those skins, then buy it, but it is better to collect gems to buy Christmas skins.
---
all reddit was already seen this video
---
Didnt know

It was teaming though because you didnt attack them

Well, it's not a sin anymore... as pope francis said ;)

...or just fantasy?
---
Uggh another reloading star power we have too much of those give us an invincibility star power for max
---
i still have time before the update
---
If you dont understand, the point is that I have a power 7 brawler on power play
---
I got this offer 2 months ago. Now I show off my 150 gem skin to people (which i actually got for 39 gems sale)

Report posts that break rules and we'll remove them.

What if..... they remove that Glitch

Removed.

Rule 5. Repetitive or low effort posts with a low discussion potential will be removed.

From that Bulgarian youtuber ahhh

Ok boomer

But you have other characters don‚Äôt you? It‚Äôs legendary for a reason lol. Not everyone is supposed to have it.
---
Yeah but in Poland we have dd/mm/yy. He is Polish and I am confused
---
Piper jumps away, Bo dies to her Super, Piper dies to Darryl, Carl passed the ball to the enemy Spike, Darryl rolled over to Spike, causing him to drop the ball. Darryl walks the ball in and ends the match. I explained a 4 month old post on r/brawlstars.
---
i'm surprised the sub isn't flooded with the sneak peeks unlike the previous big updates? that's a miracle

Use the star power glitch and give robo retreat to Carl, dude

There was people not understanding Leon? His name pretty much sums it
---
Wednsday, december 18 at 3 am EST
---
yay i love that map
---
Haha very true! Every time I've talked about the new maps in the past, Brawl Stars changes them in the live build. But yes, there will be some more community maps.
---
There are no balance changes in this update. This is speculation on my part, but I'm expecting balance changes 2-3 weeks after the update.
---
Lastly, After I created my video, Supercell let me know that the Captain Carl skin is going from 300 gems down to 150 gems!
---
No one knows that you fucking spaz
---
He thought he was playing Lone Star
---
The challenges will start on January, because it's the 2020 Championship
---
yeah i know
---
Lone Star is basically Leon, Piper, Gene with Spirit Slap, Mortis with Coiled Snake and Crow's paradise
---
Dude, I'm sorry but u have 2 legendaries at 5k, it seems like things are going fine
---
you didnt even mention the new maps, great vid tho :D
---
also, are there balance changes in this update? i've been looking closely at the gamelplays, and found no changes for now. 
---
you're the brawl guy xD
---
rip then i can only buy pirate poco
---
Bea esta muy gordaa
---
WHY EVERYBODY FORGOTS MORTIS
---
You know where you got that from
---
I got Carl at 12k
---
Nice skin!

I never seen him. But I really want to

Where's star points
---
Wtf was that lol

Now that's what I call a trickshot lol
---
He‚Äôs not so fast as them.
---
These have a star power or are fast, like crow
---
Why do you need a confirm? He‚Äôs speaking the truth though, but if you always need to know everything and can‚Äôt have theories, life is kinda stupid
---
What mode do you usually play on Bo?
---
El Maximo!!
---
oof, i was in the same situation for some time, but then i got rosa, then bibi, than spike, and more recently crow and gene. dont give up man
---
:)
---
will there be other sneak peeks?
---
It‚Äôs seaweed for the boat environment
---
Mortis is faster than crow, dont you know that
---
Like Red, who had a Lvl 5 1004 Nita (OGs know)
---
I think corsair colt is the better one but I doesn't have a clue what I'm talking about
---
will the update come out tomorrow or day after?
---
(„ÄíÔπè„Äí)
---
It could be a star point skin
---
Is pretty cool, I would buy it
---
Yah, no balance change ? I love so much balance change.
---
And no brawler rework ?
---
I love your vid üòç
---
he said bea and max sneak peeks tomorrow i think
---
I have several questions
---
I know srmosavi.. He's my friend and my "Map Maker" sensei..
---
Just asking him and i already upvoted his reply :)
---
I just got crow from mine!
---
Very cool art but why does reddit still use the toothless icon it bugs me out.
---
How much the skin of Poco?
---
Aha nice
---
80 gems i guess
---
She has like no neck or no nose or anything 
---
she is just eyes and eyelashes
---
Couch cory for sure
---
Is there anything bad in watching anime?
---
No the update hasn‚Äôt been released yet

of course you can use my clip

When is the next sneak peak being published?

# I AM SPEED
---
I know... but I like how missclicks can change a whole meaning of title 030
---
now carl has the funniest losing animation in the entire game
---
I know how to play Mortis. I‚Äôve been complimented on my ability to make Mortis work. I‚Äôve pushed him to rank 25, and with the amount of free time I have, that‚Äôs pretty high.
---
And with that out of the way, Mortis, even with Coiled Snake, is just OK. On an open map where there are a lot of targets, sure, he‚Äôll do well. He‚Äôs bad in modes or maps that have a lot of tanks, and just OK on semi-open maps with a fair mix of all types of brawlers. He‚Äôs not my last pick for a map very often, nor my first. He‚Äôs not bad unless you don‚Äôt have a star power, but he‚Äôs not *good* either. He‚Äôs just OK.
---
create a new acc if you think only new players get gud stuff xD
---
Ya man :b
---
you have 2 legendaries lol :^
---
But i am at 14k with no legendaries or Mortis
---
Max is the fastest
---
Oh
---
Thank you! Im happy too, wish you good luck

Yes, you are

Thank you for the request, comrade.

nifkname260 has not said the N-word yet.
---
Cloest things are his face in his thumbnails but his titles are never misleading
---
Mortis doesn't have a chance against Max.
---
The star power and trophies are at the bottom
---
I got him from a normal box xd lucky
---
Bruh he shoot multiple bullets...
---
Spikes attack has multiple projectiles...
---
both games do well.

A YouTuber from my country said there will be no balancing

shhh

I did use the space but reddit strangely ignored them and it massed up  so can you say about the brawler instead of complaining about the space thx I asked you critics not lessons for computers thx
---
this happens after 13 minutes. We wanted to know what would happen, and if we could get a draw in gem grab.
---
Did you click it
---
Hi RiCo WhAt'S Up
---
I made it...
---
And i see you again, woahhhhh woahhhhhh (rip rush wars)
---
Frank confirmed that as long as everyone in a party is an in-game friend, the normal chat is not disabled. This leaves me with three questions that I hope you can clarify on.
---
Can you invite one friend to a 3v3 and then hit play without inviting a random to the lobby, instead finding someone else who wanted to hop into a quick match?

Is it possible to kick a player that was invited to a random lobby?
---
Can you invite someone in a random lobby to be a friend, thus allowing them to access the friendly chat?
---
If the first and third are impossible I have no issues ditching my current dead club to make one that‚Äôs basically just a team chat for three people, and if the middle one is impossible there‚Äôs a workaround in leaving the lobby and inviting the one friend again, but needing a workaround is of course not ideal.
---
i really wanted some range and dash speed increase to balance the distance.
---
use the SP glitch with colt's magnum special and you will understand why T-T
---
also, want to be friemds? im looking for people to play with :D
---
MY STUPID OWNER WON'T LEVEL ME UP TO POWER 9
---
Party in the cemetary
---
I didn't say that you stole it, I only said that you reposted it
---
Same, but brawl stars is hyping right now.
---
Lmao, you're complaining about having a full belly, I was full before I even had a legendary
---
wow, too bad for Our queen, Thanks !
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true it would be tough to find a way around that
---
I feel like there‚Äôs no room for upward progression once u get to 14k and it puts a time constraint on getting brawlers to high trophies. Getting a brawler to 1000 trophies should be skill based and it is but it‚Äôs also heavily reliant on how much you can play in a 14 day timespan. Also it‚Äôs really easy to get to 500 trophies so when the season resets you get really spread out skill matchups with bad players and good players. Getting rid of season resets would help with bad teammates because good players would move to trophy levels that bad players can‚Äôt.
---
No I‚Äôm saying fanart was not one of the stones and there is a crap ton of that on this sub
---
Ah i see your point! Personally i also want to jump into matches quickly, but saying stuff like suggesting maps brawlers and gamemodes makes it kinda difficult, takes time to type those things. So those pre planned messages and suggest options are useful that way too..!! And yeah the normal chat function is still there to stay for those who still want to freely chat.
---
Oh good, leaking content through hacking is illegal I think
---
Do you have any proof?
---
What is update?
---
Bruh why do all of this cards have such op ataks-
---
Exactly my thoughts
---
How do you know
---
Thanks god

17.2k - 15.8k üò≠
---
No I‚Äôm saying they should remove the seasons altogether because getting trophies reset isn‚Äôt a good mechanic in my opinion. The only thing it‚Äôs good for is to keep people at the same trophy levels so matchmaking is easy, but this just leads to highly skilled players getting matched with awful teammates
---
What rarity are the new brawlers?
---
https://youtu.be/5rALA0gimSE
---
The highest i got was 936
---
At least is not 300 as kairos said (probably also other youtubers said that but i watched only kairos's video)
---
You don't need santa mike just if you play dynamike he gone
---
Maybe make star points a reward on the new trophy road to keep opportunities in the game

Lady bug bee will be more but rest are accurate
---
Crow needs a teir called send THIS FUCKING SHIT TO HELL
---
He tweeted it you can try to find it
---
Sorry for my bad edit i just though of this meme and i had to do it
---
Always pick Kairos
---
Now that you say it in that way i can totally agree with you
---
No, turrets are even faster
---
amatuers
---
No Both Max and Bea‚Äôs skins cost is Accurate
---
THE THIGHS
---
Auto Generated CC is a bit wonky because its done by AI so its probably not gonna help non English speaker
---
Yeah future = a robot from 30 years from the past
---
But the he will be too cool and Cost 300
---
Prise for bea &amp; max + skin in the shop
---
How do you know lol
---
Ppl always complain NO. MATTER. WHAT. 
---
No winning in gaming community
---
Quasi quasi non ci stavo credendo
---
But hey it's better than nothing though
---
i thought they were limited?
---
But if u don't have time, Play like old fashion, random matchmaking
---
Oh so update with be Thursday:(
---
That Guy deleted two posts for "that reason"
---
Not "The Flash" series, but from justice league, because of the outfit. Looks More like the one from justice league. But the series flash is better than the movie flash, but series has gone downhill so much over the Last few seasons. The first season was great, but the rest pretty meh, some seasons even could be argued to be complete Cash grabbing garbage.
---
F for you, but don't worry they will arrive sooner
---
I get.....nothing from that:(‚Äînot even bonus items
---
Yeah
---
100% agree  with you
---
Me and the boys after we rip out someone's intestines and consume them while He's still alive.
---
Go ahead and reread that
---
Same here man, thank god...
---
you had a power cube advantage
---
***can***
---
Emz?
---
Remember Monika's face from ddlc?
---
this looks very similar
---
Awwwwwwwwwww......‚ù§üòç that's cute. Nice work
---
Mortis about to hit Shelly in the face with the Shovel
---
What kind of post..?
---
True, but I have a counter argument. Carl is a geologist but he can also be a race car driver, a pig rider, a frog, and a captain of a pirate ship.
---
I hope I can get enough gems to afford Corsair Colt cause dang
---
Thank you Gigantak! 'preciate'it &lt;3
---
What I‚Äôm saying is I had low health and they each had a good amount of health
---
Her  sniper doesnt fit into the wild  western theme  so maybe  she  has an own  category  called the  secret agent  theme  or  maybe  shes  just  from the future theme/Robo city
---
Big boxes, i dont get how people expect me to save mega boxes, i get i made the grammar error but you cannot physically save MB yet without just buying a deal with multiple to open it right then and there
---
Agree. And also the design of the two new brawlers pretty much look the same. I mean, they're cool. But not different enough to look like a "different" brawler, you know what I mean. They just looks like skins for one specific brawler.
---
Where was I? Ah, there we go
---
Just put a uwu face and then there is a demon
---
damage is damage
---
I‚Äôm missing Tara only at 16.6k.
---
Unless u play him in 250 trophy games
---
And smoke trails leon even more
---
Bruh i literally opened like 8 mega boxes and got no shid
---
(i bought gems)
---
succ me off
---
Hope so
---
Cause their normal run is already fast  . But if using attack , Morist is faster ( I think ·ªåvO )
---
You really made an account just to insult him LMAO. What I sad waste of life.
---
Lol I'm totally gonna buy Captain Carl just for his animations. Oh and in-case anyone is wondering Captain Carl will be 150 gems, not 300.
---
It's awesome I would love to se all brawlers in this style
---
of course an epic
---
I would also love to see your opinions about my agruments, if i'm rightt or wrong, or if i missed something!
---
Mortis: Am I a hoke to you?
---
Yup. Supercell decided to reduce the price. Rey, Lex and Cory confirmed it
---
What rarity is she and Max anyways?
---
Aww really? :c
---
Oh well, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't expected...
---
"Rosa: This little genius is called Bae!"
---
"She's been a wonderful help to me and my botanical lab eversince we've met."
---
"It's her first time here, so guys, please, be nice!"
---
"Bae:... H... Hi everyone!... Hehe..."
---
isn't one of the brawler's names in the og brawl stars Poco's Hat?
---
they are speaking the language of the gods
---
lmao
---
Lol I have a 0.2695% and no sandy
---
The map is sandy gems??
---
where original
---
If put max into urban because of the modern and futuristic stuff she has
---
Check his profile
---
egg gang
---
On the maps that I've seen he fits into wild West.
---
k whats wrong with him reposting his own post
---
yeah I've heard people praising 8-Bit, but I've never seen it used effectively in Boss Fight personally. I don't know how it can actually work, considering it's so slow.  
---
In my experience the best compositions are 2 Colts 1 Pam or 2 Pams 1 Colt but, of course, you can't get that with a premade party. Once you get to VII+ insane tho, it's very easy to end up in the same game if you queue at the same time. Other than this, Colt+Pam+Shelley may be my favorite composition. I know Bull is highly appreciated, but without power cubes he is too ineffective in mid-late game, he needs those cubes, and I think Pam is the better choice for carrying cubes. Shelley with her super and Shell Shock is pretty useful.   
---
Anyway, I'll PM you my in-game ID
---
Okey, if not that would be stealing
---
Is against the rules
---
no it isn‚Äôt he only did it twice, whether he reposted this stupid excuse of a post is besides the point
---
XD good times
---
Can‚Äôt wait to play it
