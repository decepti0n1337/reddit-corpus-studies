He doesn't have enough wins to have that many trophies, which means a lot of 2nd places to get all those trophies

Oh really? Perhaps something like... this?

Correct. But if you do it a second time, you still have a 1/12 chance of a 6 and heads coming up.

Take my upvote and leave

Wow dude, thats dirty, who tf would draw that?
---
Same! Look at my latest post

I like lone star but not as power play due to rng.

yeah but getting 6+heads both times means 1/144 chance

why is there a dot on the upvote sign? I dont get it

Am I the only one that's getting my front page full of fan art? Really stops me wanting to browse the subreddit. I'd much rather see highlights and good memes.

Good point, another idea could be his attack is the same as Frank‚Äôs, but, because he jumps into the air, his damage is 360¬∞ around him. 
---
Also, he could leave a ring of say, 8 land mines at points around the damage circle.
---
Part of the game is luck.  Deal with it.  It‚Äôs like every single other game ever invented

This format is a throwback and i used it in a different way. Do we have a problem? If you dont like the post downvote or do nothing, i dont need to waste my time talking to a hater
---
wow! I have a suggestion, make a test where a middle hero is pulled by 2 or more genes in different directions outwards
---
Fabulous work. Would be nice to see incorporated into BS and go through negotiable balancing.
---
Many people is liking this. So then it would be possible that the developers add your brawler to the game! :D
---
I understand that but some people completely ignore the bot, maybe do some damage to get an okay rank, but mostly kill players.

This one is on HOT!

His super should be to make a circle of mines around him or smash his ball into the ground, making a shockwave!
---
**my aim is true**
---
If you having trouble by getting targeted by other player. You should try to get far away from them but still being able to attack the robot. Example, if a piper killing anyone on top side on the map, and you spawn at left side of the map. You should take path to bottom side of the map. This strategy gave me 98 Trophy in power play.

The thing about formats is that they are so widely used as one way that if you use it another way, the meme doesn‚Äôt make sense. Just use a different format or make your own.

Don‚Äôt panic, I just came on here because I didn‚Äôt get mine either. It‚Äôll probably be just like when star points first came out and some people didn‚Äôt get them. Last time they fixed it in less than 24 hours so I bet they‚Äôre already on it.

Hmm, not sure then, I got mine 11 minutes late so I‚Äôm not sure what I did to trigger it. I doubt it matters but what game mode did you play and did you win? I played life leach and got too 3. Maybe you have to win a matchü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The brawlers haven‚Äôt been too great since 8 bit, i love sandys theme but the mechanics are meh. And emz is just dumb

Yes i think so. The season is over and i don't seem to get anything.

Edit: I just got it. Wish luck for you guys.

The objective is to kill the bot this is interupted when people kill you while in other gamemodes the usual objective is to kill so you can win in takedown this rule kinda works but of your getting killed the whole game you can't get to the bot and can't win
---
i think it‚Äôs also on minecart madness

Roco looks like he‚Äôs about to say that he‚Äôs the father

This happened to most people. It‚Äôll probably be just like when star points first came out and some people didn‚Äôt get them. That time Supercell fixed it in less than 24 hours so I bet they‚Äôre already on it.

Not the best plays but I would feel salty as well if that happened to me, but hey u still got 8 trophies

Why does supercell keep buffing incendiary, when they can just rework 4th rocket to be more balanced?
---
Why does supercell nerf Piper‚Äôs damage, instead of her ambush starpower?

Remove tick from the game. It‚Äôs a brain dead overpowered brawler

Here's a tip that most Gene players use to become better: Don't waste a substantial amount of ammo at any point if you can't kill them and you're only trying to chip them down. Gene's long range cone of smoke is useful for checking bushes, stopping enemies from healing, and control. It isn't used to deal major amounts of damage, take down a brawler with decent health, or spray the enemy with. 
---
Also, learn how to aim his super. It's useful for those last second Gem Grab comebacks or pulling an enemy out of the way so your teammate's Brawl Ball kick can make it into the goal.
---
Lmao
---
Everyone gets a certain amount of star points depending on how many power play points you earned. The star points take a couple minutes to go through though. You‚Äôll get them eventually.
---
Nah ;)

Well, a couple of weeks ago i got the lvl 100(i think it was) for $8.99. It came with 350 gems and 2100 gold. The original offer was $19.99 and came with 4000 gold and 350 gems.

Takes time for it to process. Had around 650 and I got powerpoints

Just wait people who got like 300 points are posting screen shots

Hehe boi
---
Heck!!  Can I save your pic!!?
---
That is if you stay in it. Brock's and 2nd power penny can do that amount.
---
Because with El Feugo, his burn dmg is good but he would kill the brawler anyway with his normal attack so he doesn‚Äôt really need that extra dmg.
---
I mean most of the lines are supposed to be cringey like Carl or Poco.
---
Right. I wanted Leon to be stoic and say one liners like ‚ÄúGotcha!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúWhoops, were you there?‚Äù ‚ÄúCamouflage.‚Äù Etc. All in a loud sort of whisper. But instead I got the actual 11 year old voice.

The 4th level: going phcycologically deep into the levels of something until there are infinite levels of thonking about thinking about thinking about etc. etc. etc.

Yes I made a typo and yes I will keep it there

The numbers can be changed, but the idea is what matters.

Seems reasonable. Might protect him cause you created an area control.
---
Bull: *teleports behind you* nothing personal, kid.

This makes me think we should get a big crowd to welcome somebody home from an airport and one of the signs says ‚ÄúSupercell Buff Leon‚Äù and then the video zooms to that instead of the person coming home.

When I was 14 I still knew how to act like a ninja playing capture the flag in the backyard. He is way too obnoxious for the part. I‚Äôm sure a lollipop shouldn‚Äôt be much of an impediment to being quieter.

its like franks attack and as we all know he is such a big target when attacking pls make him swing his mine. that would be awesome!  and pls show its stats too
---
Not cause of that but because of her face
---
picasso frank woah
---
Not sure if you have thought of how this Attack will work but I had an interesting idea for his Super. Perhaps it‚Äôs sorta like Carl‚Äôs Super where you can spin while hitting enemies, except this super can push people back too. The knockback has sort of a ‚Äústun‚Äù effect, and since it pushes it away it makes it great for escaping too
---
Stop. Saying. It‚Äôs. Piper. From experience it‚Äôs usually the colts and leons. And it‚Äôs an overused joke.
---
Thanks man
---
Oh god‚Äî

Then where are his toes
---
Look at the trophy count on shelly and bibi
---
At least it wasn't like you had 149 gems... Actually, that would've made a decent post.

Shit post

No. Some brawlers would be way too op, so I don't think this is a good idea.

The bouncy one in mostly 3v3 when there is a lot walls, in solo/lone/takedown i recommend roboretreat, but do not use it on cavern churn. You should push rico in duos, on cavern churn(it is easy with the bouncy starpower)

No matter how much children in this subreddit try to ignore. The cold hard fact is that killing each other in takedown is what you are supposed to do in order to get ahead of others and kill the boss.

If you spin you are a cheat.

There was a parady of that brawl talk and made it say " she survived in the jungle by punching communist in the face" and Dani was like "that's me" and the sad violin music started playing
---
Yes. His dps is insane, but then his super is useless. Kinda like what Carl was when he was released,except reversed.  Carl's main atk used to be trash, but his super was too OP. So they buffed his main atk, and nerfed his super. Now, they need to buff his super, and nerf his main atk.
---
Getting to rank 30 is a question of skill ceiling, we're talking of skill floor. I have Barley as my 3rd highest ranked brawler at 300 trophies, which proves the point on multiple levels:
---
1. I have managed to get it on relatively high rank because throwers are easy to play.
---
2. 300 trophies is not a lot, thus I'm a bad player, and therefore I'm a proof that even a bad player can be relatively successful with a thrower.
---
Basically sandy is defense while leon is offense

What happens if they get 601 701

No one's called Dynamike op, the point is that he's easy to play. That has nothing to do with his powerlevel.

The Leon's face when Frank gets him is So. Damn. Adorable!

No. I'm my cool phone that doesnt happen but in my iPad it does and you can see it more clearly

The season wasn't over -- that's why trophies weren't run down. Season ends in another 6 days

They it would go to 600 and they'd get 2 star points. Or 700 and they'd get 3. Maybe an additional bonus 10/20/30/40/50 points based on reaching 500/600/600/800/900. So the work you did for reaching those trophiess doesn't disappear.
---
Crow needs a rework. A good idea imo would be to nerf the poison duration to 3 or 4 ticks, but buff the damage of his attack to make up for it, so he won‚Äôt be broken in showdown, but still usable in 3v3s.
---
Was that an online match
---
Hmm I thought I read end of season
---
I would add Darryl's voice first. And I'm not sure but the brawl stars team stated that they're not going to give a voice to Spike because he ok this way and a voice would make him weird

Wait before the username is a c

True.

I imagine that they‚Äôre instead charging up their energy. Morris has to dash forward and swing a heavy shovel and sleepy Sandy has to throw his sand far ahead of him as he moves
---
r/lostredditors
---
Ok maybe...but his small health and small dps isnt ideal for 3v3...he sure is playable amd can get you some wins but those kind of brawlers are better for showdown or lone star.
---
It is. The Daryls should have gotten one of the star powers:shield or quicker reloader. Since it didnt had either of them, it was an online match. Not friendly
---
I‚Äôd have to disagree with you on that. When someone says a character is easy to play and easy to get kills with, it‚Äôs pretty safe to say they are calling that character overpowered because of how easy it is to get kills with. 
---
Obviously opinions are opinions though.

Have you used a firearm before? 
---
This argument isn‚Äôt even about brawlstars anymore. The fact is, if you‚Äôre going to call a brawler lazy or overpowered you should at least use that character enough to decide, not just see his mechanics and think it‚Äôs a lazy way to play. If someone makes the claim that it‚Äôs easy to use a certain brawler and it‚Äôs easy to win with a brawler. I would expect them to be a fairly high rank with said brawler.

I don't get how crow is useless. People only see crow as a damaging unit and his poison as a useless extra damage. People forget that the poison also blocks heal, which is absolutely useful against almost every unit and extra toxic is heavenly good.

They usually try to trickshot and fail therefore losing the match.

In a game with optimized balance the high ranked brawlers would be the ones with highest skill ceiling, i.e. the ones that are harder to use.

Then that's some serious gameplay lol

Been there, done that, and won

I hope he gets hit by a car.

But he's the last brawler

I agree lol

We need to be able to pick game types we want to watch on Brawl TV. As it is now If you do not want to watch power point matches you are SOL.
---
Same I don't think there is something wrong
---
Bandana, Bandaid

If they buff crow crow gets the biggest win-rate
---
Everyone is in the same trophy range. Matchmaking got it right on this one.

Yeah but this have just poped up in my shop. Btw should i buy it.
---
I‚Äôve seen this post a million times
---
Rip all those brawlers that died to Shelly‚Äôs super especially Rosa when she had her super
---
FURRY POCO
---
Big win-rate with low use-rate means the brawler is strong if you are skilled with it but weak if you are a noob.
---
Big win-rate with big use-rate means the brawler is OP and needs a nerf (direct or indirect).
---
Low win-rate with big use-rate means the brawler is fun but weak.
---
The goal is to get a middling win-rate with a middlig use-rate, not to get everyone's win-rate high.
---
I don't understand what you are saying.
---
I was checking the pic: oh this man really looks like KairosTime

Sorry mate, it's a boy...

The buff of ‚ÄúAmbush‚Äù is crazy especially in graveyard shift she can obliterate anyone in her way with that buff that went up +800

Why idiot? Its not the best way to grow in trophies but if he likes Shelly let him play her.
---
No

I said crow deserves all these buffs

Pause the video at any time to get your combo. It is a 1v1- once one brawler dies the other wins. Discuss who you think will win in your scenario!
---
no tease
---
1.I didnt downvote 
---
2.I did read it fully.
---
3.So what if there is a chance of draw ? 
---
Now I'm going to downvote it.
---
I'm actually just wondering why you hate this guy so much just because he's not playing in a way you consider the most fun, didn't think I sounded like I had issues with you.
---
And with real-life assholes I get right up on their face. I'm not afraid unless you're armed or in a group. I do have some combat training, so...
---
Gods us no hat level 1 Mortis
---
so u did downvote lol. so youre telling me you dont care that you played for 3:30 minutes and end up with 0 trophies? everyone i play with hate it at least
---
The super is lazy
---
You need to, that mana is limited!
---
Idea A Great

There is no point in arguing with you. Have a good day

He was sarcastic, u used white on a white background so its really hard to read it

Thx bro ‚ù§Ô∏è

Already part of it XD
---
So what r u saying is Piper is very powerful???
---
When u get closer to her she deals no damage at all.... Even low health can do that
---
So why not have insane damage at long range
---
PLSSSSSSSSSS!!!!
---
I have several questions sorry,
---
1. How long have all of you been playing brawl stars for?
---
2. Whoever is reading this, what is your favorite brawler and game mode?
---
3. On a scale of 1-10 how excited and nervous are you about the upcoming championship?
---
Now, for some tip questions.
---
So Im at 2.2k trophies, and I have only one super rare, Rico, but I have two epics, Pam and Frank, and a mythic, Mortis. Is this supposed to happen, because I heard super rares were super easy to get, but somehow I have more epics, even though the chances for an epic are like 0.60% lower than that of super rare, and even a mythic, 0.95% lower. 
---
Do you know any players who have experienced this kind of luck, or is my luck just super odd? I've been very confused as to how this has been happening, since literally every player who is lower than me, have at least 2 super rares, well from the ones I checked at least.
---
M8 you‚Äôve done such a great job I feel like they gotta add it now.
---
Kids Don't Use Auto Aim PLS!!!
---
hope they increase the matches played per day 3 matches seem low
---
Good one! But I feel like you edited a liiittle bit too much xD

Wow such #IDavie

Same here with my friend and I playing in the school library

The school WiFi is a hit or miss on how good the connection there is, and today, it was a definite miss
---
Fair enough
---
Yeah pretty much everything you said there was nonsense.
---
Your "calculations" are laughable and your conclusion therefore is nonsense.
---
Thanks for the laugh. Btw at no point did I say you MUST kill people. But if you spin to team with someone you are cheating and that is a plain and simple fact.
---
Also again lmao at those attempts to calculate chance of winning. Fucking hilarious.
---
Reload the guitar with rings of saturn
---
Noone who makes skins about nita and brock etc. Understands that they dont need skins Pam Tick and some others do tho
---
Well, this is getting into more general game design philosophy, but there should be some sort of payoff for something being harder to use, usually a higher powerlevel. The harder a strategy/character/item is to use, the better it should be, when/if the player can utilize it optimally.
---
Basically the amounts of trophies on player's brawlers should go: difficult ones they can't play &lt; easy ones &lt; difficult ones they can play.
---
YES. JUST YES. I have nothing to say its just amazing
---
For me it‚Äôs that furry Nita
---
Tick is trash and I will post a pam fan art soon
---
because it‚Äôs not about just about finding people to play with
---
r/cursedbrawlstars
---
A brawl stars anime would be top notch.
---
9. Solo and Duo Showdown both made selectable in power play rotation
---
10. Quality control added to community maps
---
11. Brawl TV Filters
---
12. Total trophies and power level added as factors in matchmaking
---
13. Many other things I'm too lazy to list
---
Then u get killed by poison
---
get then good
---
From what ive seen this is just frank with Carl's super. Not to bash what you've done, still great work.
---
And the weird thing in this is?
---
That looks cool but that would function horribly
---
Agreed since right now, all the brawl tv matches are power play matches.
---
Lol thats unfortunate
---
what you mean quality control?
---
Omg there is Brawl TV?
---
Mine:
---
Trophy road: Brock
---
Rare: Poco
---
Super Rare: Penny
---
Epic: Piper (or Bibi honestly)
---
Mythic: Mortis
---
Legendary: Crow

This is some great art! I love how Gene‚Äôs looking for his lamp and Spike is holding a power cube. So cute.

It doesent follow the Brawl stars style

i remember this

Modern feminist in essence. "no shes not fat, shes just plus size!"
---
Last enemy brawler obviously
---
Gaara tho ü§î
---
Because some or most of the community maps are so poorly designed in my opinion. So, I think quality control is necessary.
---
Best tips for playing
---
Extra toxic 20% debuff that is op trust me I am a crow main
---
What rarity hes he?
---
Haha very funny he has 6 skins already including no skin
---
Even tho the art is not yours
---
And Bibi needs to pull her bag back from the swing , primo needs to regain stamina from constantly puckhing people
---
He is underpowered 6 seconds of invisibility is not good when that's his only gimmick
---
Mortis reloads his thighs
---
It's for this case that I say one hut from the bush and that can also be 10 seconds the main it's the idea in herself
---
Dyna, Primo, Rico, Bibi, Gene, Leon
---
As if the enemy team would be dull enough to not find anyone
---
once you said poorly designed island invasion came to my mind lol
---
How are you ?
---
Sorry sir but i dont have a van
---
Lol ok
---
Congrats (:

I have a 900 Shelly and I still see those damn crows on almost every map.  Idk if they are OP but they are too good for how annoying they are
---
I stated that if a friend was mad and he takes his phone. Not lend?  No need to downvote üò≠
---
So this is what non Americans see us as
---
Fatigue
---
I agree, I just hit 9200 and got 50 coins like, supercell, come on bro
---
This is actually really cool
---
I didnt downvote you. Also theres a reason phones have passwords/pins/patterns to unlock. Getting your phone used without your consent is unexcusable.
---
So you or telling me someone hasnt snatched your phone out of your hand while you were playing or doing something.
---
That kinda pisses me off a bit because the bot isn‚Äôt that small of skinny and the shells aren‚Äôt even that far apart
---
There's not enough space to shoot through. Those two block holes need to be wider, otherwise this will just be full of only throwers üò¨ because ranged brawlers like brock can't shoot far enough (there's too much in the way) and because tanks can't sneak up well through the tight gap (because the passage is so small it's easier for throwers to hit them while they are trying to get through).
---
Well i have 9k and i dont have Geen and legendaryes (sorry for meh english)
---
That's what I would've thought
---
But it absolutely did, my friend
---
colt carried lol
---
That would be sooo bad and annoying, it looks meh and the it is just completely inferior to the system Supercell is using now
---
Since when are randoms good with Nita?

Nah it‚Äôs great you can get a star power

So appropriate

Was that a pun?
---
i had never seen it , maybe i have a common post idea
---
That was not intended
---
Is it for real?
---
I wish! But no, it's blocked off by some mesh
---
I can imagine that. You did not do well. Anyone can kill anyone with anyone. Piper can kill bull too easily, yet bull can also kill piper too easily. If you kill Mortis as dynamike, then tell us, okay?
---
Alright bet
---
Yes, but you need to tell us what app u using to make these videos
---
I‚Äôm at 12K in the same boat. No Mortis or legendaries. Very sad indeed.
