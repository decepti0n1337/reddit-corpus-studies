120 works fine for PUBGm, and PUBG has GIANT maps and TONS of players.

I like solo a lot more but teaming makes it too risky, I get bullied :(
---
glad to hear!
---
Just a lot of luck with the timing for the 3 teams, and in the end.. getting close to piper made de difference
---
thanks a lot!! :)
---
Again I partly agree with you there. What really needs to be fixed is the UI of the whole game. No need for brawlers, maybe release a duel game mode but really that‚Äôs all you need. I also think taking out siege would be a good idea. After all releasing nonstop brawlers would make pushing easy. I also think they need more fun involved in the game. Lately my friends have pushed a lot, but almost none of them enjoyed it. I haven‚Äôt played much since I have a job but I understand the need for a UI update and such. Really right now, the meta, even after balance changes is still one of the worst. It is putting the game under fire on reddit, and many people are quitting. They (as in the owner/CEO/COO) really are just money-hungry it seems, and it is ruining the game for beta players. The upgrading system is horrible compared to the pin upgrade system. Really supercell needs to change it quickly or it is going to die out in most likely less than a year.

dude i see people have 1390 ish trophies and getting a legendary brawler i know there is a luck factor too this but like it‚Äôs not a good thing to rely on luck it just ruins the fun soon i will not be able to play brawl stars cuz i will eventually make all my brawlers get to many trophies that if i lose i lose too much and some brawlers that i play i‚Äôm shit with so yeah all i ever wanted is crow guess that aint happening any day. anyway i dont want this comment threas to go on forever

Those people are lucky. You are also pretty lucky but not as much. Same with me. We gotta be grateful for what we have. There are people at 10k without legendaries and they don‚Äôt complain about it(well they do) and get all their brawlers to 500

I said but he will kill you before you can get 7200 health away

where would i show it

Oh nice map

yeah but paying 1K dollars or any money on this game will happen one day cuz literally got the worst luck i even dont have the all super rare brawlers like what ?

idk o.o

Well yes, but actually no

Check out my post please
---
Tell the guy from who you stole this art that it is very good
---
Maybe we had the same idea
---
Whats a subresdit
---
I mean. Yea your right you either need to say which brawler your gonna be to narrow it down for your friend or you need to be in a call "this 100% happens every day, its not a opinion, its a fact" BUT like I said it could also be a coincidence that the same ppl got in the same lobby and teamed with eachother again just because they happened to run into eachother again... And tried to team with eachother again... Without knowing 100% that they teamed last time. Im not saying your wrong they 100% could be in a vc, but it could be a coincidence which is why they wont ban anyone doing it without proof like.... Seeing them in a call or something along those lines. (Jesus I wrote alot üòÇ wish i could write like this on essays lol)

I was playing at 450 brawler trophies and this Jessie was going in the middle and just autoaim her shots before dying.
---
How come a jessie reach 450 trophies playing like a full retard ?
---
Its just gun game but it would be smarter if you could get a power cube per kill if you die -1 power cube or so
---
Slim name is Super Dar√≠/il

It used to happen all the time in the early stages of the beta, it was called "orginized teaming" but once all the top clubs agreed to Kick and Ban any member doing it that was caught it quickly became very rare.

I'll try to find it

I use primo power to jump to safety, thank you very much!
---
-snap fingers- pull enemies
---
I hope in the future that matchmaking looks at levels but at the moment I doubt ‚Äúespecially with the player base being low due to being a month since an update‚Äù would be able to take in to account power level which is annoying because some star powers are p2w like Leon/Penny/Barley/Jessie/Nita/Colt/Morris/and Darryl‚Äôs
---
So sorry I was thinking of a legendary chest skin for him my bad, amazing creation
---
That's definitely wrong because I play much more intense online games like pubg but use way more data than brawl stars does and I have zero lag in games like that. But on this game and Wi-Fi I often get lag and I have Fiber Optic internet
---
Which app
---
Sooner or later I hope they will take them into consideration! Anyway thanks manüî•
---
&gt;I feel the only game mode worth playing is Solo showdown
---
HAHAHA i dont even feel like playing solo showdown because of all the freakin teamers
---
Idk how many cups you have but high up she is top 5 in almost every mode so I would wait until you get more experience or if you do have a lot of cups it‚Äôs just a person thing

Nice job man!

I lose it because of the bugs

I hate supercell
---
No it's supercell's fault for not optimizing their game for Wi-Fi networks, I don't get this problem with any other mobile games pubg, fortnite are any much more data-intensive then brawl Stars. This is a problem with supercell servers,
---
how old is she that shes a loli lol

Ok thanks

It is siege.

Oh, I thought you meant that you like playing Dynamike, but ok.

I do.

If it is why you got 6 trophies?

Good counter but replays are locked for brawlers under 400 trophies
---
Hey mister
---
... Remember that this is my first one. And I will try to make it better. And this is not the ending. This is a start to a 20+ page comic. So wait for it

That shouldnt matter. The replay should be available if you report someone in that match

2.using the classic trash joke of sIeGe bAd sIeGe=-100 while the truth is that you are too retarted to play good and then when you lose you blame the game instead of admitting you are bad.

You have my respect.
---
Congrats!

Wonderbot
---
It looks like ash from r6siege, neat!
---
Therapist: El Primbo isn‚Äôt real, he can‚Äôt hurt you.
---
El Primbo:
---
So Ash and twitch having a baby?
---
Solo Showdown
---
Spike doesn't need a nerf at least.
---
Don't
---
My experience of playing with randoms is little(actually a lot) bad. I play in 3v3 and my team: me(~7200 trophies), some jerk(less than -4000- 3000), and a one that always have ~5000.
---
Opponets' team: some top player(10500+), another top player(12000-13000 or even bigger), and a random 8000(for some "little balance")(he/she has ~8000, it's obvious)
---
SUCH A GREAT MATCHMAKING
---
How many trophies do you have.
---
Bruh, your teaming
---
Jessie looks like fucking ash from rainbow Six
---
I'm dying
---
I like the idea, maybe Carl would look cool as the train engineer and I think it would fit a bit better
---
And make barley luigi
---
The thing that comes out of magnetic electronic rifle, watergun and crossbow
---
Can‚Äôt relate i have spike :v
---
over 7k
---
Before I had gene lv 3 and had 450
---
Jessie: Don't come to school tomorrow
---
Well the thing is, some Morti are stupid, in showdown it is pretty much impossible to kill Morti if you don‚Äôt have the sp.
---
Samurai mortis
---
300 is equal to skills, OK. Everyone can get every brawler to rank 15.
---
Post it in cursed Brawlstars
---
New Star Power idea: Jessie's turret now moves around (albeit slowly), seeking out enemies. If an enemy comes into range it stops moving and starts shooting üòÅ
---
backup?
---
Why cant it be improved?
---
BROCK IS OP
---
And that's how she died
---
Cuz u fucking autoaimed
---
The thing is this won't affect noobs who are the people who jump into the enemy lines
---
I found this screenshot from December. Total accident on the timing, but I think it's hilarious nonetheless.
---
I freakin hate teamers
---
I didnt have sp though and also it was on Scorched Stone and if you check that map you can see at top left where I cornered him
---
I'm confused as explain
---
Did he deport Poco, El Primo and Shelly?
---
Yeah, the corner part was obvious.
---
you really like throwers dont you
---
B/c of a large amounts of ...(you got it)
---
Mime Frank with a beret and a baguette hammer
---
Rosa and brock too, maybe Tara as well
---
I just noticed the Shelly is supposed to be in terraria lunar eclipse
---
sure!
---
How would the bullets bounce tho
---
Brock is African American tho
---
ikr
---
And he lost like 7 trophies and it took him and hour to get it back.
---
Nah, for real though, congrats, it must feel good!
---
Cool but what comes out of her gun
---
Dou used piper in Brawl ball
---
Rico- Mario 
---
Ricochet- Luigi 
---
Piper- Peach
---
Well  ok
---
Yeah, just like how when people make memes on other subreddits they credit the maker. Oh wait, this is the only subreddit that takes memes so seriously.  
---
Can you imagine AdviceAnimals, if every meme had to give credit to the original maker...
---
I like this background story!
---
Are robots kids?
---
It doesn't have to be p2w. A friend and I created mini accounts and decided to not play with certain brawlers until we max them out.
---
And we actually did and wrecked a lotta noobs üòÇ
---
How is the map good or bad?
---
Man I hope his mom's credit card has a very high limit. Those three legendary brawlers alone costs over $150. And Kairostime did a video where he spent $1000 on the game and only maxed like 10 brawlers.
---
no ones gonna stop me from teaming in minecraft hunger games
---
Thanks, Im hoping to get my first legendary (or Tara) in the 10K box! Im only 60 trophies away!
---
Am I the only one that will comment on that guy's name BikiniPamSkinPlz srsly
---
If I had her, maybe. I don't have her so I can't say if she's good or not but I play brawlers in game modes they shouldn't be played in.
---
Baby shark do do do do dodo

Looks like Ash from Rainbow 6 Siege
---
Don't make me go further.
---
Not always,
---
Sometimes I have decent teammates and I play with em again for a few rounds and gain quite a good amount of trophies
---
Ye

 Hi, can I use this clip for one of my funny moments videos? I will give you credit. This is my YT: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJyrNfNgjwN\_B6IWAZqbWzg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJyrNfNgjwN_B6IWAZqbWzg)

Shusuebeiwn2nebsy

Omg explain lol
---
true but i dont think they would code in a new wall piece for a community made game mode with 19 upvotes
---
How is this meme format called?
---
Make em go ‚Äúoh, oh, oh!‚Äù
---
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
---
You made my day, thanks.
---
Where is the star power section?
---
Np UwU
---
ro-skating, fellow gamer
---
Damn boi, he strong...
---
I haven't had a brawler in a lot of weeks, my chances have gone up by quite a lot and still nothing..
---
Cool!!!
---
But yeah, for the most part, I‚Äôm just screaming ‚ÄúYOUR USELESS‚Äù at them XD
---
Speed Frank up a bit because Bibi just walked behind me and swung 3 times when we were at least 4tiles apart lol. I dont know Bibi's swing radius, but Frank was too slow. Jmo

Great then, I won't buy you a beer üòÇ

---
No thanks

---
If she doesnt get one in the next update, or at least a remodel...im freaking gonna sue them bruh
---
No offense dude but in any map u make you should not make "CONTINOUS BUSHES "bcuz if u did shot gunners will be op like in (eye of storm)
---
Chooo
---
And it's not fun to get this... Things into my team u know
---
Where is the X on his beak?
---
No
---
Why :(
---
If it exists, there's porn for it.
---
This includes:
---
- Brawl Stars brawlers (Jessie)
---
- Pretty much any game you can think of (not exaggerating, literally any game)
---
- Furries/animals
---
- Movie characters
---
- Anything else that exists
---
If you want to go deeper, there's subreddits made just for that.
---
OMG He is so handsome.
---
Uses leafs
---
She got the gold Tactical ar
---
That you get to level 70 is not that big thing
---
He is perfectly balanced now dont buff or nerf him any more
---
BOXES GO BBOOOOOOMMM!!!
---
You don‚Äôt get the joke do u
---
Also r/engrish
---
I got 12 today
---
Guess I'll buy a 3/4 bottle
---
Thats true cuz her super is pure cancer
---
Sure xD
---
FBI OPEN UP!!!! YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR LEWDING A LOLI
---
*uses incognito mode*
---
Forgot
---
I am Michael, but i don't Mike because i from Russia.
---
Sure :D I don't mind
---
So he gave up. So the fuck what
---
Literally this doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Supercell should really do something
---
This is Brawl Stars, not Lego Jurassic Park
---
Yup this is all bs. Supercell should make an update where high trophy players get an increase in the unlocking a new brawler percentage :(
---
i encounter it always not just today
---
Jessie: Okay so first I'll warp the White House back where it belongs!
---
Idk maybe.. I dont look at this subreddit everyday and this idea actually came up to me like months ago
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they come back, I think I saw lvl 5 pack this week
---
Ash from Rainbow Six???
---
wow this is incredible, it was literally tracking you for a solid 10 hits and possible more?
---
It's supercell but whatever
---
Ash from r6???
---
no
---
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢, ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢, ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢. :)
---
Shelly is smiling there cause she has super while Colt is off-guard
---
I have all legendaries but no mythics, coolio
---
In replacement for LeonüôÉ
---
I made a second account, where i am on 2800 Trophies with 10 Brawlers. I still need El Primo and Rosa.
---
5k is decent
---
   
---
only in the place of the pick a shovel with charcoal would look perfect
---
&gt;Is that an Endgame reference?
---
cyborg DC
---
and did you push him alone?....i have no friends who could play brawl stars with me, so pushing is hard
---
7500, no mythics, 1 legendary... Bought ;-;
---
Y its NSFW tho
---
I know this is lower than both of you but 7k and no legendaries
---
I carried my audienceüôÉüôÉüôÉ
---
Or none
---
Not funny
