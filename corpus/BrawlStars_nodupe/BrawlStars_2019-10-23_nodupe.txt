thanks i was mesing around with a stile
---
---
---
What would you spend 50k star points on?
---
did you get anything from the mega box tho?
---
I started pushing after I saw the brawl talk. I know it's not a big deal but it still feels good.
---
in help and assistence a man tell me this dont pass in many times but i see like 10 posts like this
---
yep only here for the event
---
10 months waiting for a legendary...
---

---
UNLOCKS LEON*
---
And I am still waiting...
---
In the strictest sense of close range brawler with a gap closing super, but yeah they are pretty different. Wasn‚Äôt really my intention to relate them but the other guy was insistent.
---
Honestly the 2 brawlers that seemed fitting if they didnt have voices were leon and spike but spike just gives off a üóø vibe
---
Mm not really that im salty just cuz I dont have it. Its just annoying how my sister got it at 3k and she has his star power smh.
---
That Shelly super strat is pretty obnoxious, at least the ep primo jump, it was quite hard but the Shelly super is just annoying
---
Plus imo, leon is sorta trash atm so not looking forward to unlocking him. Id rather unlock smth else
---
Me : _says anything hateful about Leon and get 59 downvotes_
---
[removed]
---
I was hoping she would be 5000 star points I knew she would be more expensive than linebacker bull but she didn't really feel it was mecha bo tier... That is until 8 saw the crossbow animation. Still think it is less than 10k though but whatever it is free anyway.
---
~~Am yet to open. I don't think I'll get anything though cuz I just got mortis a few days back.~~
---
Nothing special.

Can't do "15% chances" because that's RNG. It will be unfair.

I just noticed the background

---
It's 150 gems. Which is amazing because Leon gets gets a custom animation, attack animation (Bones instead of Shurikens), and a wolf howl whenever he goes invisible
---
Did you attack people?
---
Spike won‚Äôt get a voice because he already has a voice. He just makes cactus noises. Have you ever heard a cactus before? Sounds exactly like what Spike says.
---
Frank said that if the win rate is high and players are loving the game mode, it will become permanent. I hope it will!

Wait are you saying its a better or worse version
---
These are icons provided by supercell to content creators
---
and sorry for the repost, I had to change it up a bit until it was good!!!
---
¬ß
---
Now that I have leon's voice I wish he was with spike.
---
I‚Äôm saying that Emz super is so much better than spike that spike will be useless in the meta.
---
Bibi health nerf is bad i already have trouble pushing in showdow due to no skill shellys and other high damage brawlers
---
Legend has it dynamike is still trying to hit the double
---
No u
---
Yeah exactly it gives incentive, which is always good
---
Only with speedy star power
---
Oh in that case it‚Äôs perfectly fine I guess
---
He deserves that
---
And a vpice
---
That makes one of us ...
---
That netfix adaptation is perfect
---
FUCKING REPOST
---
EMZ
---
Brawl Stars Thot?
---
Oh my god. So leon WAS a demonic creature
---
When do you think the update will be?
---
Everyone just needs to play it a bunch. I think it would be a great fit for the ticket event slot for during mon-fri.
---
O O O‚Äôreilly
---
Wait a sec. r/woooosh

Leon is thicc

There's this one dude on YouTube who got Leon and Crow in the same box... back-to-back. Like what the fuck?
---
Mega epic
---
He just look even more like a pervert
---
USE CODE "KAIROS" WHEN  SPENDING GEMS.
---
why are you posting this there‚Äôs no point

I got close, I think I only needed to get a few more upgrades (mostly super monkey's tier 5 upgrades)

REST IN HEAVEN
---
WEll i say he needs big buff, maybe even 19 per cent more helth and 8 per cent more damage.  BALANCE BABY, BALANCE.
---
Pfft what are you talking about *sweats nervously*
---
Bet it didnt go off your finger
---
Spike looks like the joker and cactus had a baby
---
Thanks
---
Vscrow girl
---
Lol
---
Will Pam be getting a skin after the rework
---
good meme XD
---
Frocking
---
What
---
No one is throwing a fit... its constructive criticism
---
More like Sans with pink tears
---
That's still not a viable excuse as Rico's damage is also high but you don't see him getting nerfed. Leon is doing worse than Rico as he has meh range, and bad damage at range. He's supposed to be medium ranged but no one uses him like that, he barely gets anything done in 3v3s too. For proof just watch the pros play, you can see that they sometimes pick Rico because he's solid granted that you know how to play him really well, Leon is never used in competitiveness as he gets often replaced by someone who can do the job better by having more range or more survivability like Spike with curve ball or Bibi with shield.
---
Laughing me that got sandy from a random box in the background
---
XD
---
I got him on Sunday, then yesterday the balance changes were announced:/
---
Just saying. And hey, if u get the star points, u can get the new Jessie skin and make her look better ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Me neither
---
Just don't stress about losing trophies
---
Hehe that's true, you have a point there
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL

Once you get a brawler to power 9 upgrades stop. That‚Äôs the brawlers max stats. But star power, which is shown in-game as power 10 can give an additional ability like speed boosts or regeneration. You get a brawler to power 10 by unlocking the starpower out of a brawl box (the rate is around 1 in 200 brawl boxes). Each brawler currently has 2 unique starpowers that apply to it. You can also buy starpowers from the shop for 2000 gold
---
I'm very curious, how many trophies do you have.
---
Finally he has some friends to hug with
---
So it's Band-Aid 1.2
---
Kairos said that they might keep it if it was popular enough, and he didn't even see this
---
Winnie the Poohlley on the right
---
and instead Leon overheals to x2 health.
---
Kinky.
---
I dont get it
---
Jk
---
They had teamed up and they all piled up and I killed him with a blow but then I couldn't get close
---
100% luck lmao
---
Ok help help
---
I mean, it doesnt make much sense for spike to have a voice ( no offence to any fellow spikes out there!)
---
Ikr we need more buffs! Frank-buff it no buff?
---
Glitches and exploits, it‚Äôs been in the game since it came out and supercell never patched it
---
üòé just imagine if there was like 5 crows teaming in graveyard shift üòÇ
---
I just hope Dumpling Darryl isn't changed too much.
---
Noice job
---
Supercell: we can't do this
---
Ok I will help by not responding anymore (you have to do your part too)

I spit in the face of your soft metal armor

But both the 150 skins will have special effects and animations
---
Leon, what did you do?
---
Is this from Sesame Street?

Stop stabbing leon 47 times in the chest!

Leon‚Äôs buff was a skin and voice acting

Riot nerf him, so i am not.

FAQ
---
What does this mean?
---
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.
---
Why did you do this?
---
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Rudeness towards other Redditors, ‚Ä¢	‚Å†Spreading incorrect information, ‚Ä¢	‚Å†Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.
---
Am I banned from the Reddit?
---
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
---
I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
---
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
---
How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
---
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.

Extreme spook.

Amazing
---
Used to main Leon. This might be the end of using Leon for me. His invisibility is (was?) already pretty short after the last two or three nerfs. Instead of stealthy assassin it‚Äôs more like invisible escape artist now. Lame. Supercell is killing their most iconic brawler.
---
Hehehe autoaimed it /s
---
Yeah
---
Sakura is much better
---
Cool idea!
---
Your telling the truth alot of pros say leon is the worst legendary in the game. Maybe it also has to do with the fact that leon received so many nerfs and now people are auprised to see.one after 4 updates (but thats just me)
---
This game gets better every Time
---
I agree
---
Link https://crux.page.link/1v9BT

primitives attack other players in takedown
---
*:( noises*
---
The number of times you tap doesn‚Äôt mean anything. A mega box is 10 random draws. If you have all powerpoints, that 99% probability goes all to coins. So it runs the slot machine 10 times, each time asking, should I give this guy coins with 99% probability or a star power with 1%. Then it adds up the results across all 10, and presents that to you in the form of the box opening screen.
---
I like it
---
"quirky" 
---
"unique"

Heh. Yeah, about that-

why everyone who tries to paint leon including me makes him with broken neck

Id fucking beat her to death with my shovel and dance on her dead corpse

---
Supercell: HERE YOU HAVE YOUR SANDY AS YOU WISHED
---
Not sure if you‚Äôre joking but she‚Äôs Australian
---
I can tell you not why but what I hate about the update. Nothing done to clubs, trash servers untouched, say hello to next month of teaming, 5th crow buff(like... Seriously?), more monetisation on 150 gem skins etc. etc.
---
Elementary problems of the game which are not that hard to fix(in most cases) celebrate their another month in the game. Now c'mon, downvote me BS fanatics
---
Okay that makes a lot of sense. Thanks a lot! The way it‚Äôs presented at end game just made it feel like I was getting ripped off. Thanks for the explanation. Been wondering how it worked for awhile. Really appreciate it.
---
I mean.. It WAS.
---
Lmao
---
I can hear OJ say it
---
Don‚Äôt talk yourself down this is very good, a ton better than I could do lol
---
Ok but same lmao
---
My first ever viral post. Thank you
---
for about 2 minutes until people found out about it :-|
---
I like see new players, because the most of them don‚Äôt know Gene, Carl, Rosa, Bibi and Tick were ‚ÄúNEW brawlers‚Äù
---
She might have a basic star point skin (similar to pink Piper or iris Tara)
---
Supercell really upping their animation game
---
Nice! Good job!
---
Hm just a question are you guessing or do you know
---
I guess that gives it away
---
Mortis doesnt sit on the babies he feeds on them with his bats which he brought
---
not if i have it, just like the lunar skins
---
Im one of the people who attack others
---
I only like powerplay everything else seems like trash to me
---
And balance changes suck btw
---
someone do a ricardo milos and shelly comparison
---
lol i guess the fanart of leon revealing his tru self to nita was tru
---
Supercell: Sure! Trophy road rework coming in winter of 2028!
---
Maybe because all the good people who don't like bad randoms play showdown
---
well, all the shop offers are resetting in 3 hours
---
I thought it said stop the werewolf fanart
---
Oh God
---
Many thanks again and I look forward to everyone‚Äôs crazy ideas and comic suggestions üòÇüëå
---
Random question, but why is Piper so fun to draw? I don‚Äôt understand why she‚Äôs always my go to for Brawl Stars artüòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
So true
---
Really oh ok i guess that could be a hint thanks for the info
---
I got power 1 Shelly to 600+ on my mini account. So what?
---
NICE!!! I hope that they can read youüëç
---
I would‚Äôve won a brawl ball game if my teammates knew how to pass the ball
---
Supercell needs to add a mortis skin for Halloween :( grim reaper mortis would also be nice. Nice artwork
---
Report me then
---
Just an estimated guess, however It‚Äôs very likely based on the timeframe.
---
Yeah bro stick with him till the end and he‚Äôs already tanked about 10 nerfs too.
---
We won't stop cuz that's the best skin in the game.. MUHAHAHA
---
They follow the trend. Zombies like EMZ
---
Destroyed üò≠
---
Sorry to ask but what post of yours made it into meme review #29 i dont remember
---
8bits in the shadow realm
---
Not confirmed but there is a high chance idd.
---
Hm ok thanks cant wait
---
Irony, such pose when he got nerfed üòï
---
LEEOOOOOOOOOO
---
...OOOOOOOOOOOOOL [BOOOO]
---
I wish i could
---
Don't say stop nerfing him, but say buff him! His super is gonna be trash now without star powers.
---
It doesn't suck, you just don't know how to do math. 
---
With a probability of 0.001209 and assuming you open a single megabox, the number of trials is 10, X ~ B(10,0.001209)
---
The chances that you'll get at least one legendary, P(X‚â•1)=0.0120
---
That's 1.2% every megabox. 
---
It doesn't suck, you're just expecting to get a legendary every megabox and when your expectation doesn't come to fruition you complain. If you say it sucks, tell me what probability would you implement so that legendaries still have the same rarity and exclusivity?
---
I'm actually not that excited.When the update drops everyone will play with emz.That's why right now I'm trying to push as many b rawlers as I can.But the thing I'm most excited for is graveyard shift ...cough...life leech...cough...
---
Cool idea
---
Thank you :)
---
too edgy
---
Delete this.There are kids who play this game
---
Thats adjust tho... not even nerf actually its a lot better for players with star power
---
:)
---
Ye the reason big boxes and mega boxes seem to have more is because they have more draws for gems. Its insanely rare but theoretically you could get over 300 gems from one mega box
---
Ty mate
---
And I got leon at under 1000, bruh
---
buff smoke trails is a good idea.
---
...fair enough.
---
They had *me* in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
It‚Äôs all good, it was the mini comic about Darryl gettin a skin.
---
You're right
---
Looks stolen
---
Oh ok thanks also great art work
---
That don‚Äôt change anything, more than half of the players don‚Äôt even have one brawler maxed, is unfair for people who don‚Äôt want to put money in the game
---
with the duration reduction, invisiheal is only getting a couple hundred extra healing and it basically forces people to use his star powers because hes going to be really star power reliant after update and his invisiheal basically only gets a 400 or something healing increase due to the duration nerf and smoke trails is getting a nerf due to the duration nerf as well. Leon basically gets 3 giant nerfs in exchange for a single small buff
---
Killo pero lo √∫nico en lo que te has equivocado ha sido en una "t"
---
Deber√≠as haber puesto 'babysitter' y has puesto 'babysister'. Error grav√≠simo, vamos.
---
Rare chance 0.001 of getting rosa in boxes
---
Do people still believe this is real? This is photoshopped
---
If they dont wanna put money, they probs dont even have leon
---
Well here my opinion, this nerf wont do anything to him due to the fact that even pros said he was one of the worst legemdaries in the game so a nerf wont really be much since he was already a bad brawler ( im gonna get downvoted for this)
---
I dont have leon so can I get an upvote for good luck
---
I'm gonna fucking kill Bob and take his power ups.
---
I'm going to do what is called a pro gamer move
---
How do I play it?
---
How do you know? If it's the shop, it changes like every day for me :C
---
Why put it here my dude? Why??
---
He‚Äôs got a fat üîíon his head for me... but one day I‚Äôll have him lol
---
I love these ideas!

PETITION TO MAKE GRAVEYARD SHIFT &amp; BRAWL BALL IN ONE CYCLE u/Frank_Supercell

The only difference I could point out is her legs ar crouched

Good job!

To me this sounds really hard, and only top 200 players will ever get rewards out of this.

That's supposed to tell you what extra move the boss gets
---
#YESWECAN

Play after update
---
Why is everyone getting so angry?

A that I have is that all the characters are actually just neighborhood kids that play around and the whole game is just their imagination with the different maps just being like a park or something
---
Happy barrel noises
---
Nice super original
---
Just use google translate if you don't understand.

"El gato voladoooooooor"
---
Lets get him to negative karma so we prevent him to post
---
If u have any new brawler keep it aside u can play it against EMZ
---
Ok good for you. I'm new to the game, shame on me for being proud of my accomplishment.
---
tick in the background tho
---
Since the time takedown was released I only attacked about a max. of 10 people, because they fucking pissed me off with their non-correct play so I decided to start pissing them of.
---
Oh come on bro the update are generally released somewhere around the time when shop resets
---
Sorry, it's just my second update, I didn't know. Thanks for telling me tho :)
---
Ouch, that sucks man.
---
Bro I often see you in some or other sub reddits u seem very active
---
That would be a cool voice line actually
---
Thanks for help!
---
Great art
---
And look the same also
---
its gonna be the new skins and i cant play brawl stars cause my phone ben gone for a month
---
hmm wait where
---
How do you charge your super then? The point is to prevent others from damaging the robot and letting you get the most damage. The best way to do that is by damaging or killing the players themselves. Also r/shittybrawlstars.
---
Edit - Seriously? Imgflip?
---
THE WAR TO END ALL WARS
---
Oh OK welp ig I do apologise a lot in my post cuz idk how people will react...
---
But we'll know one thing the biggest sneak peak for update is maintenance break
---
There was never any update to prevent teaming. There was an update that had measures to discourage it (modifiers tend to favor non-teaming players) but it‚Äôs not a perfect system, even if it worked 100% of the time it would just make teaming less effective, and even then, it only matters on maps with modifiers.
---
Supercell said they have no plans to disallow teaming or to put punishment systems in place. They say it‚Äôs a part of the game, and seeing as nobody else can do anything about it beyond choose whether or not to team themselves, then that‚Äôs it. Teaming‚Äôs part of the game.
---
In some capacity, it‚Äôs not even a bad thing. Someone can get teamed on without the ‚Äúteamers‚Äù actually making a conscious choice to team - you get caught between two people, you can‚Äôt expect either of them to stop attacking. That‚Äôs what ‚Äúfree for all‚Äù means.
---
Personally, I think it‚Äôs a little bit scummy to spin at someone and then be at an advantage that the devs never specifically intended. Not *too* scummy though - mostly I just think of it as another way to lose.
---
At the end of the day, if spinning to get someone off your back is possible and the devs are fine with it happening, it is a strategy, like it or not. Choose whether you‚Äôll never team, only team under certain circumstances, team all the time, pretend to team then backstab - it‚Äôs up to you.
---
I got a 49 gems for 49 mega boxes offer. At 200 trophies. All rares, super rares, epics, mythics, and 2 legendaries (Leon &amp; Crow) even before I unlocked bull. Then at 7k I unlocked spike from a small box. And sandy at 14k just a week ago.
---
Oopvotes
---
Yeah I started playing just before 8-bit was released, didn't even know what Brawl Talk was. But I figured the maintenance break thing out, also because I used to play Clash Royale where the same thing happened
---
how tho? i reached 12k in my first year of brawl stars and i quit just after the 8 bit update cuz was too lazy
---
Sorry tiktok no pictures (and I wouldnt post there anyway)

You‚Äôre pretty close to right. I‚Äôd swap them personally - Coiled Snake is slightly better. Saying Creepy Harvest is better than Coiled Snake isn‚Äôt that far from the truth.
---
Good pun rite XD

She does.. Its next to her skateboard

I HATE Leon.

As in having to play against him. Invisibility isn‚Äôt bad when I can mark him but he outranges me and I‚Äôm squishy.

Are you expecting it to happen now or around this week?
---
True
---
I‚Äôd honestly love for the next Brawloween skins to just be Brawlers dressing up as each other
---
You fool, now all of Brawl Star player know that you are here
---
Yeah, but they‚Äôve made star powers out to be something for the elite or something. I mean I still love the game, the action and competition are awesome; I guess star powers are just over hyped
---
I want to have this skin but not enough gems:(
---
24
---
BRAWLERS, ASSEMBLE!
---
WE NEED TO PLAY LIFE LEECH MORE THAN EVER BEFORE TO GET IT OFFICIALLY INTO THE GAME!!
---
Hopefully :( it's a pure nerf cuz I don't have invisaheal
---
Kinda your fault for deciding to play with Randoms.
---
r/cursedbrawlstars
---
Yaa I see in CR we get maintenance breaks for Balance changes too
---
Don't get worried about all these things play it best we can win and lose with every brawler however good or bad they are .Just give your best
---
I am saying this because u are new
---
#wheeze
---
Shelly is my favorite brawler and for the first time, I got 500 trophies from her.
---
Also, I like this style.
---
But If u are'nt a skin buyer, There's nothing worth to gems, best way is buying brawlers from shop.
---
By the way, Happy cake day!
---
Very kinky, this is
---
Or maybe because you are the bad random
---
both trashcan on wheels
---
Ironically, most attackers deal less damage than most.
---
What‚Äôs the English translation
---
Thank you so much ^^ I wonder if I could really consider myself still new to the game, actually üòÇ
---
Teaming is a strategy no matter what u do, u can't stop people from teaming, now think and use ur brain, supercell already said teaming is ok if u don't wanna lose trophies then team if u don't wanna team, just play 3v3.
---
Good point
---
There could be an algorithm that calculated how long they stay alive and dmg they do
---
I'm one of the people who kill attackers just to piss them off. If spawn camp is possible, I'd have done that too.
---
im confused
---
it's better to outright buy token doublers. atleast then you get a lot more value out of your gems.
---
thanks!
---
Been playing since 2018 and still no luck
---
just revert the incoming super duration nerf and everything will be fine
---
Bueno
---
Aprendo Espa√±ol 5 a√±os y mi nivel es el mismo
---
I saew this on Twitter a while ago
---
Actually I just got leon today.He is currently at 30 trophies.Guess I'll push him in emz
---
F
---
I wish I could get 2 tickets out of 1 box!
---
Looks like a giant tower mutant...... I like it!
---
good old days
---
Gingers are a force to be reckoned with
---
On another note, if you‚Äôre using Darryl in Boss Fight, please tell me you atleast use Steel Hoops
---
Alright, yeah, good idea. I keep the order of my brawlers as ‚Äúclosest to next level‚Äù, and try to randomize the brawlers I use to keep it interesting.
---
My main problem as of now is that I don‚Äôt know the star powers, so whenever people use them I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwhaaaaaa...??‚Äù. You can‚Äôt plan for or predict them, especially when you don‚Äôt know who has them.
---
Damn this is so detailed
---
Actually the takedown mode is dealing more damage to the boss to win, you can change up your super doing that but they can also fight you back on top, often times is not worth the time doing that. When you kill them you are probably really low health, someone can just pop up and kill you, and the boss‚Äôs health probably dropped like 30%. Also on competitive plays the boss will always get kill within a minute, doing that is not helpful, also a waste of your time.
---
*cries in Leon's my only legendary*
---
Yeah, definitely. If you know your brawler well, you‚Äôre set. I especially love solo showdown because of this
---
This
---
No problem u will get it by the time u come back home
---
Rip my peeps range from level 1-7
---
It will happen today.In the worst case it will happen in friday
---
Not really I even made cooler trick shot than that
---
Good meme actually
---
Same
---
Sharpened spinners sounds amazing! altho it seems very op, because after your super, for three seconds, it‚Äôs 617 + 150 = 677 x5 = 3385 x 3 = 10 115, You can destroy anyone wihout powercuves with that, even a frank with sponge, i‚Äôd recommand you to lower it to 100 damage or something close to that
---
This was probably someone playing with their friends, helping them gain trophies when they are low.
---
No.
---
Ah yes, legendary brawlers are impossible to unlock if you don‚Äôt pay 30 dollars.
---
Are you serious? I have a f2p friend that got leon before the nerfs and now has only 1 brawler maxed, this nerf is trash and no one likes it even maxed players think that is stupid
---
Yaa I think Leon after nerf I still strong over EMZ you can take her out with and u mostly see her in a lot of matches 
---
The better way to push Leon after nerf All the bestüòâüòâüòâ
---
There is a good chance of all my gems getting wasted on werewolf Leon
---
It was reference to the Heavy from TF2.
---
It‚Äôs mostly cuz, right now, Leon is nothing without his super (ironically)
---
His damage is basically nothing at far ranges, and he doesn‚Äôt have the health to get up close without using his invisibility. Nerfing it kind of just feels like a dick move at this point
---
Then again, I don‚Äôt have him, so I really don‚Äôt know how to play him
---
I‚Äôm dumb then lol
---
Guilty, I just got Bo 2 nights ago. Less than 12 hours later, I got Crow (my most wanted character)
---
Ikr
---
How'd you get banned?
---
How do you know?do you have proof of them saying its going to be realised tommorow???
---
Ok, but some people didn't,so I want them to know.
---
Frank said there's they don't plan too .
---
Wh-what????no no no no no no this cant be true NO!!!!!!WHY why supercell ;-;,btw i think they will discount the to 109 or 69 like loaded and the others are discounted
---
The actual Brawl stars is when you are above 6000 atleast
---
not really star powers are easy to get im at 8000 when i got 3. i just save coins to upgrade them instead of buying them too. Many people who have played longer have more starpowers than legendaries. It's pretty funny actually. My friend who is at 12000has star powers for nearly everyone except for the mythics he can't seem to get. You're barely heading to 7000 just wait it out.
---
Wasn't hating
---
I have 10.400
---
C O I E L D
---
Hahaha very funny penis shaped.. No, it's a rocket
---
get out with the grossness
---
I'm wither!
---
3 ENTIRE matches just wow
---
Nah
---
Ah, sorry.
---
Yeah but I thought that was obvious
---
plus yall here Leon's new voice
---
Why would they bring old 3d models of the back?
---
Beautiful. Trigon would be proud
---
Great then give me it player is I will add u as a friend using player ID after update üòÇ
---
woaahhhh
---
leon from hell.
---
I didn't get any legendary brawlers. But I just unlocked Mortis yesterday. haha
---
Nope. Frank confirmed it on Twitter.
---
No discounts, for any skin.
---
I have the same proble since the last update
---
and another
---
oh i see 
---
btw love this artwork
---
Predicting it right now. With Pam's remodel she will throw her hose gun thing and catch it mid air. Then she will drop it and quickly pick it back up like nothing happened
---
Gang
---
You are very good
---
You know what. I think we all got wooshed. This has to be a bait account
---
I attack others if either: a) they‚Äôre in the way of the boss bot or b) they‚Äôre attacking me.
---
I know the objective is to deal damage to the boss, but most of the time, you just gotta attack others to prevent them from doing as much damage and to get your super to increase your own damage output
---
its a shame mike‚Äôs not getting any love
---
But still, a cactus speaking to you would make probably faint so..
---
Will the skins( werewolf leon) be back for the next brawloween update in 2020
---
she takes one less shot to kill many brawlers and she got extra health too.so yeah
---
I am spanish but reddit don't let me talk in spanish v:
---
Vote with your wallets. If enough people don‚Äôt buy the skins at full price, they will have to reduce the prices.
---
Yes it will be back on seasons and events
---
Spike is not getting a voice because a long time ago they said that spike having no voice gaved him this creepy vibe. They said the same for tara.
---
me: dashes 3 times into a wall
---
*am I disabled?*
---
Let's make graveyard shift with the highest use rate mode
---
Yeah hate that my fav game is p2w lol
---
What have skins to do with p2w?
---
The fact theyre so overpriced and i used p2w as in opriced
---
I hate it because I‚Äôm a Leon main and they nerfed him. He did not need a nerf...
---
Everybody knows what the popular star powers are for each brawlers. You probably know what every dyna and mortis uses.
---
Thats probably because you play barley in solo showdown in the first place.
---
They have 0 affect on gameplay and they're totally optional
---
Imma delete yhis post rn cuz i have the answer
---
Invisibility time maybe?how in good old days
---
Yeah ik i used p2w in another way get it?
---
Maybe spike is... yea i said this just cause of ur flair
---
ive done this to whole teams and its funny seeing them try to find which bush im in
---
Bull has same
---
He's missing his moustache!
---
*april fools
---
r/engrish
---
Well if you buff the time to much then he would be op again amd would mainly be in showdown only. I recommend a small buff to his health as that is his weakest element.
---
1 second off the super doesnt make him instantly  bad
---
Bringer of bats not bringer of bags
---
Nobody knows that dude.
---
Oh god this is genius
---
yes
---
NOOOO BARLEY MY HOMIE
---
She is here to stay.
---
Frank said it on twitter
---
Who tf is that supposed to be.

if he gets a bird skin he should have a jacket with crow‚Äôs gang on it
---
Theres no way i can photoshop this because i cant even get good quality in images that were cropped and or editted in a picture
---
No i dont think like That i just thought everyone didn't Watch kt or Lex. MY APOLOGY
---
What about when he uses his super a clone appears to trick enemies so they won't know when he uses his super(btw, the clone deals no damage)
---
Noooo not bibi :(
---
No u will get 700 points.Top 200 will get extra and top 1 will get powerpoints as the same prize of golden skins
---
Exactly
---
anyone else get no internet connection message instead?
---
dude there was no need for the description people would only upvote and lol nice work
---
What??!? For real?
---
Looks good keep up the good work :) Maybe move away from sketches and try some shading and color
---
This is epic
---
Keske shelly 80 tas olsa
---
There weren't any skins last year lol
---
Yes.
---
I cant log in
---
New trophy road!!
---
Maintenance break
---
Lines could be thicker, try going over your sketches with a darker pencil to give it a solid outline, makes your drawing feel less sketchy
---
Same...:'( 
---
But now it says server under maintenance!!
---
Yeah, I just updated it on googleplay store
---
Srsly mate its not
---
For arm64 devices already but is anybody playing the update yet?
---
It is a buff
---
Maybe because they‚Äôre updating the game
---
Hey Thx tho!
---
Oh right I just saw yayyy :D but I have school.. dang 8th grade is hard
---
I have leon &amp; crow and secundary just sandy ;)
---
Thanks :D
---
Under maintenance break!
---
I guess you can say he‚Äôs
---
TOASTED
---
You are beyond lucky my guy I have 14k trophies with no legendaries and a drop rate of 0.12
---
Update twice??,i just updated the game now from play store
---
*laughs in Brock*
---
"NOOOOOOI, MY BAAALLLS!!!"
---
What the hell is this game. I've never seen it like this
---
Do one with Piper!
---
which phone do you have then?
---
Thats the size of the rocket of the big robo have
---
I only needed one post, not 10+ posts
---
Wow. I called it.
---
emz's super kind of makes things worse for tanks needs a buff. Also the attack is very similar to barley. Also Leon does not need a starpower buff but rather a general buff, like attack boost or reload decrease or health boost
---
_I know what you feel, pal._
---
Exactly! And I can also see for myself when I LOG INTO BRAWL STARS.
---
This kid Is a proof Why I am loosing
---
Was really hoping this was a reference to Aloharad‚Äôs or Weegee‚Äôs videos on Paladins, aka ‚ÄúNot Overwatch‚Äù and ‚ÄúOverwatch for poor people‚Äù respectively, but today I foudn out this game has an actual fan-base. (completely aware this will get downvoted)
---
Stop crying that Leon got nerfed. He was OP and his super is already unfair not to mention his star powers. I‚Äôm sure supercell noticed his ridiculous win rate and made him more balanced like they always do on every update.
---
No way
---
I did update it but still ain't working
---
She's so cute here &lt;3
---
Proof in my profile
---
Ligma balls
---
dude if you have his second star power, just play with it, trust me even 800 heal/s was waaaay to much and now hes op with the second star power.
---
„Åµ
---
this is just awful
---
I updated it but still ain't working
---
Nah I believe you but I‚Äôm just shocked like how though
---
There is proof in my profile
---
Leon nerf ,tick buff, no changes to frank what the actual f... is going on in balancing team
---
this is terrible
---
Theres proof in my profile
---
I love Tick. He will be my next max brawler!
---
Get the Mexican sniper
---
Or "oMg GuYs ItS mAiNtEnAnCe BrEaK"
---
No they‚Äôre still doing stuff for the game, so servers are closed. Just because something is downloaded from the App Store doesn‚Äôt mean the update is complete
---
Love how the pumpkins are from the Tick skin!
---
I actually like this concept
---
That's normal. You still have to wait until the maintenance is over.
---

---
Mmm
---
How long untill playable version?
---
You should have done mortis instead of crow
---

---
Luck i guess
---
Yes, bull pose also back to the old one before global
---
Si... Si... Amigo.
---
dude i was just joking and btw how is this even possible
---
Bob try to be peaceful in td but every other brawler kills him. Bob came 9th just before chad who played with colt and killed bob 6 times
---
ok?
---
Hold up
---
So lucky yet unlucky. Like how do you get ALL the legendaries before one rare.
---
rare footage of middle-school students preparing for their Halloween school party
---
r/btd6 Got the game recently...addicted af.
---
What would Spike sound like when he would have a voice?
---
Oh shoot the update is out already!?
---
it's not easy to land spike's super perfectly but with emz's super you don't even need to worry about not being able to slow down enemies cause the area of effect is so much bigger than spike's
---
Too bad it didn‚Äôt get prior existing highest level.
---
nicely done, good idea!! :D
---
Eh. Easier said than done.
---
Im not sure, but the offer popped up after I updated my game. I also think, maybe its only $8.99 bc Supercell knows rhat i ain't paying $19.99 for the other lvl 100 offer.
---
 This is your second map in the game? Congrats dude!
---
Updated offer EMZ Power points.
---
Really? I just re-opened the game and I don't see it
---
Me, too, fam. Last time it was 8-bit and now this :')
---
I did... but I don't regret it, my holy eyes have been blessed by those amazing arts pieces. üëÄüëÄ
---
I think it's good they reward older players this way, getting both rewards as they have been loyal to the game
---
Wrong
---
Same thing happening to many others
---
Didn‚Äôt change for me
---
Happy Halloween my frends
---
Ah Yes its there!
---
Today I have 1 power point for Penny in a shop
---
***ALSO SHELLY GOT A NEW ANIMATION DON'T IGNORE HER SHE IS OUR MAIN CHARACTER ;-;***
---
It is fixed now
---
Those are there since the update is released now, yoy can check it out now
---

---
Thank you very much üòä
---
He doesn't have a mouth
---
OMG HOW DID U GET IT...
---
 Invisheal is too strong. You can kill a Shelly with a super!
---
first youtubers get skin to make video on it cause content. then there will be twitch giveaway. after that it will be available.
---
Yesterday I was against 6 Shelly's and one Leon with my El Primo in the end of the solo showdown. I had to check it from game logs because never seen only a screen full of Shelly's before.
---
I managed to smash down them to become 3rd. Buenas noches.
---
Bruh
---
What?....
---
Nice!
---
Haha nice one
---
PS: it's just a joke i have nothing against brawl stars' matchmaking
---
I love the update supercell, but are you guys considering making graveyard shift/life leach a permanent mode because of all the love for the mode.
---
I don't understand how power plays work. How do I choose to play this mode?
---
Stop posting this, this happens every time a new brawler comes out
---
Almost a year ago everyone wanted  a leon nerf
---
thank you üòÅ
---
How will it attack tho

There are no friends or team mates in take down, what‚Äôs the point of friendly fire?? If you mean other players, you can kill them too so idk what you are trying to say.

Original post: ‚ÄúMake it so friendly fire is on‚Äù

Rhat just means they have more range or that ur running at them.

Lmao brawlstarsp is cursed

Can some1 repost so people can notice

I wan that leon skin... I crave it
---
What you should post:
---
Whatever you feel like that is relevant to Brawlstars. 
---
If people don‚Äôt like it they can downvote it.
---
I wish they shortend Mortis reload time
---
ok fine i ship them jejcjej
---
frank nooooooooo
---
Have you seen the vid he put out right after that one at all?
---
It is in "community options" in desktop I see (I don't like to download apps for every purpose).
---
Me
---
Barley heals just under the damage he takes
---
Wow
---
Brawlers are supposed to look like this when u play graveyard shift
---
Werewolf Leon or Witch Shelly depends on what you like, do you prefer animations? Get Shelly, do you just like the model? Get Leon,but I do think both are worth it
---
DEFINTELY LEON LEON LEON
---
Werewolf Leon is the better 150 Gem skin. Personally I would get the Piper skin
---
would you wanna try that piece of englisch again?
---
might help you and everyone trying to read it
---
It's a special effect for graveyard shift.. not a glitch.. you choose graveyard shift.. the selected brawler automatically turns to a spirit like form..
---
they said spike will never get a voice (cause he is a cactus)
---
but you can hope for a darryl voice in the next 2 updates cause he is the last one
---
Jesus Christ.....
---
Upvoh pleased!!
---
I think Nita deserves a werewolf skin too, it would look awesome if she would just summon a werebear
---
the 3x tickets are still there hmmm
---
Omg...
---
that bull was so good that he 1-shotted spike without moving his hands
---
The stupidity on this sub never ceases to disappoint
---
Nope its real
---
I feel like i should link u the whoooosh subreddit but found out it was a joke so...
---
Thanks for your suggestion:)
---
Me: *spins*
---
Literally anyone who is not the same brawler ad me: *demonic screeching*
---
Are you sure they said that for Spike? Because he had a voice once, if Kairos didn't lie.
---
cries in 62
---
now when you say ‚ÄúLeonita‚Äù, are you referring them as a team or a ship-
---
I think both star powers are great in this mode but personally I would go with Extra Toxic
---
Never sort by new again ...
---
C u r s e d
---
BEAUTIFUL
---
"ok im gonna commit suicide"
---
I agree with most of these! Only Carl doesn‚Äôt feel like a mythic, because he has a 0.5 sec delay on his attacks.
---
Life Leech + Invisibility = Graveyard Shift 
---
lol
---
the voice was from one of the first trailers of the game when it was in beta so... it was forever ago
---
*ALABAMA INTENSIFIES*
---
Really like the update and most buffs and nerfs are nice, but I despise Leons change... Why a star power that's already super good but nerf everyother Leon :/.
---
Aweee so cute :)
---
Y dies it say Braw-o-ween
---
just get the one for the character you like and use the most, I‚Äôm personally getting piper‚Äôs bc she‚Äôs been my all time main and finally got a gem skin
---
Too bad grave yard shift is only temporary
---
it never said life leech either. it's just a modifier.
---
OOF
---
Well they could give us star points every season without reseting our brawlers. So for someone who doesn't care that much about star points, it does suck.
---
not her teammates.  only her.
---
Dumbass
---
More like get rid of takedown
---
Sad...yor dad died
---
We still have the star power bug?
---
Lonestar with life leech
---
When Leon gets attacked he has a voice line that says: "Don't make me get Nita"
---
Absolutely loved that

lol how dare he talks against our cute cactus

I absolutely hate playing against him. He has so much area control it's frustrating when you're on a team with all shooters or tanks.

OP was talking about the fave

Love Dva

Lemme take a quick selfie as WW3 happens right behind my back
---
Same thing with Tick's buff
---
Frank is a literal god how come he isn't a brawler?
---
So Tara cheated on Gene?
---
you can try but if they already have too many friend request pending then yours would never be sent
---
Its still cool how he did that
---
Yep since everyone is Emz it is forced too
---
or darryl and bo

Damn. I would've never thought of that

I think that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre trying to make fun of.

LOLOLO

&gt;Tbh,Tick was terrible before the buff.But now,it is a good brawler.He was only good in Heist and Gem Grab.Now he is good in most of the modes.

The one that he heals without attacking

The rockets are dopeüî•

The real answer is no legendaries.

Balance changes is total craffcrow got overbuff man did the developer team got drunk with they made these balance changes

Your either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.

Can‚Äôt believe this took me as long as I did to figure this out

This is a mod I made myself, there‚Äôs no download link here

It's one of Frank's tweets from around two or three months ago. It's somewhere on the subreddit as well I believe.

Heh, you can

Elite Barbarian Primo
---
We could almost see him face
---
Why not?
---
Some people dont have those though (i do but i meant lower trophy players when i said not everyone)
---
I know but still a fun theory
---
Why on 2 November? Where did you read that? Day of the Dead is on October 31st.
---
Oh snap
---
I feel that haha
---
Tara is ashamed
---
It says on google that it's on 2 November?
---
Because I never played as him but I ranked everyone up to max level
---
it looks better. it's supposed to look like dark knight jessie so both got changes.
---
Choke me Jessie UwU
---
me now :(
---
I‚Äôve been having trouble finding a good brawler for life leach. I enjoy the game mode, but can‚Äôt find somebody I like. Recommendations? 
---
(I don‚Äôt have crow)
---
I know it's so obvious
---
Rico looks smol
---
I understand what you‚Äôre saying but I‚Äôve done training cave before and was able to auto click super and it still do damage when landing on a stationary target.  This is a bug that occurred after this update.
---
Regular Knight Jessie now has Special bullets.
---
Asserting dominance

Oh, I didnt know that

ok, I thought that reducing regeneration skills was going to be very

what's the opinion on rolling reload. does it feel as good as steel hoops?
---
That's great Cheif, congratulations. Any tips for that map?
---
And his super doesn't need a nerf
---
I know, I was listening this morning, and at first I thought it was ‚Äùdon‚Äôt make me get near ya,‚Äù because of his attack, but then he Shouted Nita. Yeah, I like that supercell is creating more lore around the brawlers, and who they‚Äôre related to

It‚Äôs 10/31 - 11/2

Thank you! Very cool

Bug: TACTICAL NUKE, INCOMING! ¬°
---
yes. poke damage and long range is good in this mode. he has both.
---
Please tell me I‚Äôm not the only one who thinks this isn‚Äôt right.

It's not my finger

Yes, he is an unjustified nerf

Ye it‚Äôs pretty wack

Tara is so sad. Where is Gene?

Yea...it's will be hot

(S)PAMBUSTERS!/MAMA JR.! SHE IS THICK! MAKE GHOSTS SICK! CALL NOW!(terms and conditons apply)

I dont wanna see that.... But i will still search if it exist
---
Like your face I imagine.
---
It's because dynamike went to mortis's house
---
Me: No
---
The idea isn‚Äôt original, so in my opinion the whole post is unoriginal. You stole the idea.
---
Yea but if everyone does that strategy some of those people will still get 7/8th. You have to counter what everyone else is doing . It‚Äôs very situational and you‚Äôre not necessarily wrong
---
Ah, curiosity :"3
---
Ok
---
Not in a good way though.
---
Can i get a comm of ,,f'' for that el primo?
---
Clearly everyone has to buy a chest to get him.
---
/s if it went over your head
---
They are SIBLINGS bruh
---
I know, but cant go back
---
if you look closely  , his feathers originate from border of circle below his model. when you autoaim, you land perfectly and your hitbox aligns with the bot. so all the feather move outward of bot and none hit him . it's very less likely to happen with moving targets.  you can still autoaim on targets with very large hitbox ,like ike or boss bots.
---
It's your choice.
---
Well they said that for Christmas skins but they are coming back this year.
---
She knows that she is OP on the release
---
Tbh everyone does this. Especially from 300+
---
And if you see a dynamike...well, you know what to do...
---
Thanks, I reposted it myself
---
Uninstall and install back the game (MAKE SURE you already CONNECT YOUR BRAWL STARS WITH EMAIL or you will lose everything)
---
Lol I love it
---
I agree, you think you play a brawler again you didn't play for a long time, but it's pretty annoying how braindead most people on that trophy range are, like yesterday i played gem grab on mincart madness as tick, i thought my tick is still rank 21, so let's push him to 600-700, the first few games where pretty easy , my teammates knew how the game works and we could easily beat the enemies (that's how the first 5 games were), but then i had an el primo and a dynamike team, i was the gem carrier as tick, cause the enemies didn't had an assassin which could get to me and kill me (mortis, leon, darryl, ...) and the dynamike also took a few gems, but at one point i died at our spawn and the dynamike took the gems, he had 9 gems, while the enemies just had 3. He then chilled back in the spawn to not die and i thought "well the primo surely could take one gem and supers back to us if he has low health", the primo took one gem, but supered to all 3 enemies and died "i thought ok, maybe he didn't wanted to take the gem and just jump to the enemies to give us time to get the 1 gem we needed" anyway they now still just have 4 gems we surely will win. The primo respawned came to us and when the next gem came out, he walked right in, took the gem, hit some enemies, had his super and again supered to the enemies, and that's how the entire game went, till they had 11 gems, they then retreated, but we could get 2 gems befor the timer goes down, but the primo was the one who took those 2 gems, it's not like he accidentally took gems, he always waited and then took the gems when they came out and when the enemies wanted to come again cause we both had 11 gems, our primo again supered to their spawn and fighted against all 3 and died, then we just had 9 gems anymore and they had 13 gems and were also already in their own spawn. 
---
That's just how 1 of my next few games went, in the other games i also lost, my teammates were also braindead, some more than others
---
Me to :))
---
I'm here only for the trophies (Emz)
---
[Why? His other one literally had black bars from the image on it. ](https://minecraftart.netlify.com)
---
He meant that even they lost their teammate got star player
---
Because you‚Äôre lying.
---
I see. Good choice
---
Well I can definitely see how mature you are now
---
Thats creepy
---
That‚Äôs cool, but now Nita will need Leon voice lines to complete it.
---
Me to
---
didnt know this one
---
I laughed
---
I know I was making a joke
---
Lmao X-D
---
What is your tag?
---
Leon gets nerferd infinitely with no end. GER is supercell. Also, happy you understood the reference OP.
---
u cant just say upvote
---
To what?
---
Oh wow, I didn't notice... That happens if the player is just that good. You earn "points" for every hit/kill/heal and objective you do and if you win you also earn those points and the player with the most points gets star player, so his teammate got so many points that even with the bonus points of the win the opponent still didn't get star player
---
leech life is unplayable
---
I see poco
---
I was making maps for a while...but i gave up...
---
Barley tho
---
well, invisiheal would have healed 7k hp.
---
the only thing nita can say is "nita" and "bear"
---
Mmh she thicc! 10/10 would fork again
---
I use piper and everyone somehow manages to get hit
---
You've got my signature
---
Big brain
---
Why you lyin?
---
Yes!!!!!!!!!!
---
It was very simple to make it so we will see the level we beat before the update... So the reason is probably the tactic Yde made...
---
Rico is at an advantage because he doesnt need any heart replacement to use ubercharge
---
M.I.A. Paper planes has gunshots and they sound like shelly‚Äôs super
---
I only got 10 wins so far for team kairos, EPIC GAMER MOMENT
---
I think otherwise, for i love the simplicity of the current version more
---
I will see of it, thanks carl
---
Also they should make her a custom pose
---
I agree, although her shadow can out heal the HP drop but it comes with a price
---
Mortis Morturay is close to retropolis now
---
What if nobody has ever damaged him?
---
I cant thinking about, if piper becomes monster like Caroline at end of the movie.
---
Anyways, thats a nice video! Have my upvote (Geology rocks)
---
Not even once?
---
she takes some skill tho unlike the last 2 brawlers at release
---
What do you think?
---
Lol, thanks again, rocks lover boi
---
Big Brainnn

Sorry that i ruined your joke :/

the game files say she is a mummy :/

It's ok mistakes happen

Wait, does he says that too?
---
L E A N O N
---
I mean this is a mobile game directed towards children and young teens.
---
Well if by some miracle nobody damages them give 1 star to last place or nobody gets a star
---
No, he‚Äôs a crossdresser and you shouldn‚Äôt assume.
---
Ok I can see that
---
you may never know. Plus Graveyard Shift makes Crow or Pam OP there.
---
I love his new voice! It makes him cooler and gave him a personality.  (I specially love when he say something about Nita :D)
---
Oh absolutely. I was at 601 when you hit 700. You hit that mark first. Nobody can ever take that from you. And you did it with power 2. Very impressive.
---
Just look replays when 2 shots a frank
---
idk man xD
---
I didn‚Äôt take a picture of the class, many would have thought that I didn‚Äôt paint this at school.

Not anymore, here's Frank's comment regarding this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/dlwgni/the_level_100_special_offer_got_a_buff/f4w9sfo?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

but tara is a half human half shadow
---
But still, just life leech/graveyard shift how it is is better.
---
Hey! Love your remodel and new style! Party time!
---
Nice Meme!!
---
The deal will still be there tomorrow (there is written 1d 18hours remaining), so you can get your tokens and open boxes tomorrow aswell, so you would have another chance for that one gem
---
I got crow in a brawl box when the update came because I was saving my box to upgrade emz
---
In duo its free power cubes but in solo..i hate when i die because of the robot
---
stonks
---
I won 3 matches whit bull cause of the robo
---
Without the robot it would be 7 teaming throwers, 2 desperate bulls/Shellys, and one rico spamming the wall.
---
Atleast it wasnt nine :)
---
Ok thank you
---
Who do u think it is? Bull?
---
Nooooo!
---
Yeet
---
Yeah I figured that out really quickly. There are a LOT of people see them as siblings. But some see them as a couple.
---
are there any bushcampers graves?
---
Ok boomer
---
ok thanks, luv u :3
---
but you didn't used more ammo then you have on base and darryl is just an easy target an often killed before getting his super you where lucky with that piper just giving a free kill
---
Who gets the referencje will go to heaven but...
---
... Those who dont will burn in the hellfire
---
It's actually better cuz I didn't have to wait for the maintenace break
---
###That would be OP against sandy.
---
Wow srsly. It doesnt. The skin overall is better. Its juat a matter of opinion. Dark jessie doesnt have an interesting color palette and scrappy just looks kinda meh
---
üòÇüëçüèª
---
They need to add boxes and for damaging it get 10% healing of damage you do to the box
---
the way that works for me is to maintain good spacing with other brawlers, not spamming her attack, and using her super to ambush with your team or to make the enemy team back off
---
###and instead of him saying power cord, he says power crown and turns into Pocoette!
---
Im sorry I had to
---
I got spike at 2800 trophies and now i'm at 11000
---
###And flowers are blooming ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

Zit jij trouwens ook in de club winst and losses want ik zit daar namenlijk ook inüòÅüëçüèª
---
Which is? With Emz' head or not?
---
Nobody noticed EMZ having 2 star powers?
---
Give her a unique meaner sounding voice and I'll pay the 10k
---
I use mostly "by most trophies", rarely "by rarity" (just when i want to look at a specific brawler, like sandy, to have him at the top or for others to right know where they are and not have to search) and i never used "by power lvl" cause all my brawlers are maxed, so it would just show all brawlers in the same order as when i use "by rarity"

I don't think is the valentine poco.And I saw that too.
---
Which map is this one?
---
That means you were at least 20 random draws into a cycle already. Another 20 and it upticked once, then 40 more and another uptick again. I monitor this with all my box openings, and it is still consistently true. It never fails me; I screenshot ever box and every 39 random draws, I take a screen shot of my luck, open a small box, and screen shot luck screen again, and it always upticks on that 40th random draw.
---
Also what kind of boxes did you open, all small boxes or some big boxes and mega boxes as well?
---
Thank you.
---
Frank really is deformed (his deformed arm and the deformed neck, really are weird), i thought they remodelled frank in this update, but is this really the best they could do?
---
You have done right by our people

Thank you Cheeze.

Uhmmm, white crow was the first crow skin, at the time of the start of the beta, there were just 2 legendaries: crow and spike and their first skins were white crow and sakura spike, now crow got plenty of skins and all are better than the white crow skin

---
Petition for him to say "You can't see me, my time is now"
---
didn't this joke die like 7 months ago

They should make it so you can report players for teaming. It gets manually checked, and if the person was teaming their account gets deleted. If they weren't teaming, the person falsely reporting gets a 2 day ban (to discourage false reports).

Good fucking riddance! Karma will always chase spinners!

No offense, every brawler is cool in their own way &lt;3

I just created it without thinking

Hell yeah man this gamemode is so fun I was about to stop playing but then they updated and this came out it‚Äôs really fun

Oh, gotta press play without first, thanks.

If nita is 5, leon should be less than 5?

Which one. The star power 9ne or the fact that she can crash brawl stars with that star power Cuz she just does too much dps
---
That's a cute ship

Yeah, they want people to spend gems on emz power points than to get them from that mega box.

you forgot people complaining about emz bieng a vsco girl
---
this is a remarkable present u gave me

Maxed piper also does wonders.
---
Wow. Just noticed that!
---
Every time he says "time to brawl" I hear "time to bruhh"
---
Yeah but they don‚Äôt do shit... people don‚Äôt understand that a petition doesn‚Äôt force a company to do anything
---
All it does is show how much people want something done, a company can say ‚Äúif you get X signatures on a petition I‚Äôll do Y‚Äù but if the company never agreed your petition could have a million signatures and they wouldn‚Äôt have to do shit
---
Wow that sucks, I am at level 151 and I only bought the welcome and level 5 packs! Dang it.
---
How immature are you?
---
I really happy he got voice acting but it's just that the voice he has now doesn't fit his character at all
---
I expected him to have an mysterious or older voice. I just hope well get used to it.
---
Yeah. To be honest a lot of brawlers are better than Pam and Crow. It‚Äôs just those two are really overrated and overused, so people naturally assume he must be the best.
---
It‚Äôs like primo at sub 100 trophies. Everyone thinks he‚Äôs op, but he really isn‚Äôt.
---
I've seen plenty of worse subs, but i was able to forget some of them, but not all, anyway i wont link them, cause that's how i found them, someone linked them and my curious ass needs to click all links and to not be the dick which does the same i wont link them
---
a reference to TMZ?
---
Sry no.
---
It's great. Well done
---
If you get discounted token doublers tho which is the best value its 7 mega boxes &gt; 6 and 2 big
---
Maybe you‚Äôre bad, or not used to not regarding life without attacking
---
isn't it 2 early the event won't start until Saturday less than 3 day from now
---
hey look a dead figet spinner
---
Haha, if you enjoy it keep playing. Most of my brawlers are over leveled such that they only go up power level 10s as level 1-6s, so I‚Äôm just playing for star token.
---
is there gonna be an offer? on the store
---
Hey he was a lil weak ok?
---
Shovin a dirt block down ya throat,
---
Genius
---
Mine is at 500 now fortunately.
---
Doesn‚Äôt need a nerf, this was pretty situational. You got lucky they didn‚Äôt get rid of you first and you outplayed him.  Not every showdown is going to come down this close and everyone letting you live.
---
I played for five hours, I got used to paying attention to healing with attacks. I had 13500 trophies, so I'm not bad at the game. The mode is just flat-out awful.

bro you posted Tick's dong, now you are going to get brock and ball tortured.
---
I can confirm that Spike with curved ball is OP, hitting even 1 thorn already puts you ahead of the opponent, because of the great curve that thorns make, it is also possible to hit barleys behind walls.
---
NOTE: I think Barley can get into Tier s too, with his healing star power he's very good
---
Betrayal
---
Check out some YouTube videos from brawlstar creators. Basically their are teams and whoever gets the most showdown wins in two days win. Kairos, Coach Cory, Lex, and OJ are some of the YouTubers that have teams.
---
I am excited that he did get a voice, but it's just it doesn't feel right for the character that everyone knew
---
heya chief pekka, hardwork pays off
---
Am i the only one who likes it?
---
how do u do the 8bit and emz star power merge
---
I like that he has a voice but it just it doesn't fit right for his character and it can get pretty annoying pretty quickly
---
Oh yeah, now I remember lmao. Can't wait for your next drawing dude, you've got talent
---
Bo and crow is also related to Joe
---
Very noice
---
Good thing he‚Äôs nerfed.
---
very balanced don't forget to put the pixel crux link so they can add it

It‚Äôs Carl‚Äôs hat since he spins with his super, &amp; Dynamike‚Äôs dynamite since he spins when he plays solo showdown
