I know xd but don‚Äôt worry will get one soon

No you didn‚Äôt, it was leaked weeks ago.

We‚Äôll

Just about in the same boat as you but with less brawlers.
---
I have 29 gems ;(
---
Won‚Äôt happen, but makes sense. 
---

---
/u/Brawlstars?
---
Mortis still trash
---
Yeah it does make the game less fun. BUT it‚Äôs not unfair. Anyone can team. 
---
üò≠
---
Hat is so much better. Smh
---
Been playing almost since it went global and I don‚Äôt ever remember seeing this map in rotation:/ that sucks ... oh well the new ones look pretty schweet!
---
That's awesome man, sure it will be a ton of fun. Btw, where can I make maps for the game?
---
I think the idea of anti teamers is like the champions you don‚Äôt form teams with. 
---
Both can kill you pretty quickly. I personal don‚Äôt team with Bull or Primo
---
I remember upvoting it great job man 
---
&gt;420 Super Damage 
---
Nice.
---
Remember kids if you spend $2 you get a level 100 boss as soon as the update comes rather than $5 later you‚Äôre welcome kids who stole their parents credit card
---
I miss this...
---
Optimally you would play him as a vulture. Since he has such high mobility. 
---
The arrows are so scared of Bo's chest line they just fly away
---
Where did you get them from
---
Yep, it also predicted the new SD map. Gene has an attack similar to Nita‚Äôs which I‚Äôm guessing does more damage(1400) but has a smaller range. His super pulls people in if it connects(doing 420 damage) which goes well with his short range. His star power will launch him over walls I believe, which can help him get out of sticky situations by knocking him backwards.
---
You can still get him for 30. He isn‚Äôt thicochet yet
---
16. He had all super rares and Piper and that was IT. It was difficult af to grind for him in a situation like that
---
I played this map like once. I don't see any point for them to remove maps. There should only ever be more maps
---
He‚Äôs the hook guy character. His basic is a shotgun blast and his super is a hook.
---
When crow gets remodeled  he will
---
I never team. I prefer playing on my own. In fact, that is the reason behind me playing Solo. 
---
Poprico
---
Oh shoot! Maybe they will just say his original costume is a girl, they could say his new skin is a trap, or they could just not have a voice for him ü§î
---
Unfortunately, Global Launch will not be included in this update.
---
It only apparead once with the energy drink event. R.I.P. At least they are removing Shooting Star, cancer map who always appeared lol
---
Nah crow has quite long range, so in general it would only do a bit less than pipers 
---
Mystery solved
---
I agree, add Daryl to the list as well
---
/r/ThinBotHate
---
It‚Äôs would be cool for some credit!
---
Before Drinking/After Drink
---
The new one is 80 so buy gold rico now and save 50 gems
---
Especially with the other guy who made the brock skin... like why aren‚Äôt they posting that they‚Äôre taking the suggestions...?
---
tbh darryl isn't that bad, just really difficult to use.

---
The most likely reason they are removing hats is that they can add themed hats for skins, such as popcorn rico
---
So in other words the old gold skin will be automatically replaced with new one?
---
Leon?
---
Your drawing was first thing that came to mind when I saw the announcement!
---
#F
---
He is difficult, which most people just say he is crap and don't use him. But he is a lot of fun to play.
---
I see. My phone works differently and separates it so it all adds up to 100.
---
I just think they'll remove them all and add a brawler who is a hatter.
---
Yep, I have all the other brawlers maxed, so lots of Leon power points. Like 30-60 per big box
---
wondering the same thing, I bought it for 30, lets hope I made the right decision
---
But what about bugs, what do they all really want to know?
---
No way they would do that, hatter would be op af
---
They actually buffed alot of brawler this update.
---
I'm short of 6 gems. Dammit!
---
Who‚Äôs Darrel?
---
This is the third time this has been posted on this sub yet it gets upvoted the most. Reddit at its finest. r/karmacourt
---
I honestly like popcorn rico more than loaded rico
---
In the little sneak peak you can see that it is a hand that pulls them toward him, like a magical floating genie hand.
---
Exept Dynamike and barley
---
Obviously it was a hint but lex also got info from Ryan
---
Correction: she‚Äôs kyle‚Äôs mom from South Park 
---
I wanted change it to feel weird yet? But i also wanted to leave the normal format of this meme 
---
Maybe he has another genie in his lamp and that grabs the people lol
---
Wheres my piper skin @??
---
Really? How many do you have?
---
you coulda just switched the pictures and changes it to gene
---
Scorched stone is the only way I can get my darryl up lol
---
You don‚Äôt get more tokens you only hold more, instead of having to play every 12 hours to get all tokens you have to play every 24 hours.
---
I was refering to the thing where the bag hits you, splits, and then you get hit by the shrapnel
---
I remember using poco to dominate in this map
---
YES i love you
---
You lucky sunovabeach
---
Buff Leon
---
 It was a joke 
---
Yeah but the gene is the new one , not roadhog
---
One good super that counteres bull would be him rainsing his red cape for 2/3 seconds. He wouldnt take any dmg from the direction he was pointing the cape.
---
I'm not, I'm just saying your post is kinda irrelevant. It's not like he's going to be useless OR that they wasted their money. They unlocked him and got the trophies they wanted out of him.
---
0.2* 2% would've caused the game to crash
---
And frank
---
I mean, I've already thought about that, but the robots still getting to the safe... Hmm I will just let them be them
---
If it‚Äôs false, Kairos time is lying then
---
No, you did, he‚Äôs just saying he‚Äôs not too serious about the grammar mistake. It‚Äôs all good though.
---
Yes obviously the youtubers have exclusive info but what i‚Äôm saying is that the genie was a big hint, and the fact that ryan said there was a hint about a brawler led us to believe it could potentially be the genie, which it is
---
It's like mortis but uglier 
---
That's what discord is for
---
Did you notice which direction they were coming from?
---
That‚Äôs right, everywhere except where the Primo is
---
yes and he also looks younger
---
Thanks , love making brawl memes
---
Maybe
---
Not an achievement to boast about
---
did he say update was mid feb?
---
I'm out of the loop. What's going on with rico
---
What if people dont have discord or dont want discord? Also, normal phone calls just mute the game, so no phone calls either
---
I only say one think, -If it's okay like this, why change it?-, really, I don't understand the change of Poco and ‚ÄúRICO‚Äù.
---
The pink spike makes sence, but, the others?
---
What if ur playing randoms
---
wait how do you make maps
---
no it magik
---
Hello i need 2 people to do the new glitch

Wow nice stars

Tribute to oj?
---
Unpopular opinion: Brawl Stars changed the rico model to reduce the amount of shipping between brawlers
---
For anyone saying "dude you were camping in that bush" well... there was a poco with 6 cubes camping in the bush above me
---
I‚Äôm just talking about Leon, they make him brokenly strong and then make you pay 70 dollars for him, crow needs a buff and spike is super good
---
Thats how mafia works
---
Didn't get super rares till after 1000 how can U not push
---
Yes it is. At least he is balancing his play time and not maining one or two brawlers.
---
Finally a Poco skin?!?! Time to save them gems. 
---
I know
---
Yeah, in the game files, it 3 brawlers were found(these were like from a month ago. And one named the catcher had a super like GENE‚Äôs. So i expect the other stats of the catcher to be GENE‚ÄôS stats. In the leak it says the catcher shoots a projectile that if it doesn‚Äôt hit an enemy it will break up into smaller shells. And the star power called improved kickback says ‚Äúshotgun kickback now allows the catcher to jump over walls, so OP!‚Äù These leaks were the same leaks that predicted the Christmas skins, the brock and mike skin, the snowy maps, the new boss fight mode. So these aren‚Äôt fake leaks and now seeing GENE having a grab super means he could be the catcher. Of course this leak is pretty old now and the devs could have changed the main attack or star power by now but they definitely kept the idea of grabbing a player in and its possible they kept the idea of his star power or main attack for GENE.
---
It really isn‚Äôt being used correctly 
---
You should friend me on brawl ;)
---
That's amazing!!! Congrats üòä I'm getting all of my comp stuff tomorrow and will start streaming. I can't wait. I'll check yours out! 
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt see that one
---
Sorry I want clear.
---
My point was that there is no "luck system", supercell just tells you guys that to pull the wool over your eyes 
---
Think about it... If person 1 is level 70, he's clearly played more , and hopefully unlocked more boxes. If I'm person 2, there's no way my "luck factor" should be close to as built up as him...that is unless there is no luck factor after and it's just a random roll. They just are losing money so they need to keep the lies up to keep you interested
---
Yep :)
---
True
---
The fuck happened to chet
---
Lmfaoo
---
Needs Gene somewhere in there 
---
As all things should be
---
The best mm so far
---
Wanna play? I‚Äôm trying to push to 4K so I can have some boxes for when gene comes out
---
Great idea! My only concern is the zero damage on the first attack. I can see someone getting caught in a deflection loop unable to do anything but run from a ranged brawler, especially on showdown and duos. Maybe put some damage points on the first attack and I think it would be perfect. 
---
(I know he's a pacifist, but his first attack HAS to have at least a little damage to the opponents.)
---
Teaming is a risk and at the same time a strategy!! 
---
tbh all of these look quite unpolished, except for the colt one because it's really safe and simple.
---
*Don't.*
---
So his name is Rico instead of ricochet now?
---
PS. The gap isn't op because the ball uses amo
---
I‚Äôd literally shoot myself

Anyway you got max key but its funny ü§£
---
YeAh 
---
U fr?
---
Big L
---
You're really dumb, aren't you?
---
Damn and u had Leon that's tuff
---
Or u could just do the glitch and get hella boxes
---
Some brawlers can‚Äôt destroy walls so the walls never breaking may be op on some maps because then he could trap them. Maybe they could have 3000-5000 health like the boxes in showdown? Idk just an idea
---
Thats an exploit that can be used to grind a ton of tokens by having the el primo distract the robots.
---
Don‚Äôt tell me you are the type of person that frees the El Primo, because all you are doing by doing that is ruining the exploit.

I got a sale for both. It was originally 700 but it was on sale for 519.

Phenomenal Cosmic Powers!
---
Good art and Interesting Mechanic. Only note is a full combo (3 hits) does little over 1k damage, most brawlers do that in 1 shot (some even do 2x). In addition the HP and range are rather low.
---
In my opinion, what this Brawler needs is INSTANT reload. With instant reload, all of the brawlers flaws are overcome by the ability to keep attacking. This also would be useful for brawl ball.
---
&gt;take some gold too

 Thank you!

Maybe a rework is needed. Piper is good in Bounty but not so much everywhere else.

i didnt it already lookes like that before ! i apparently predicted the balls inside him so thats why he appears to dont have any skin 
---
I disagree. I like playing spike. Throughout playing him I have gotten better with to the point he I‚Äôm the person I mainly use. I know people have different definition of mains but isn‚Äôt that the basic definition?
---
Definitely something to think about... hmm... well there's plenty of ways to die if you're in a corner.  There's some potential to outplay it if you space correctly.  His super doesn't automatically push people on one side of the wall.  
---
F
---
I have, or should say had all my brawlers maxed at lvl 20.. darryl was also up there bc he was awesome at heist, however, I haven‚Äôt been playing to push as much anymore Bc I‚Äôm a little bored of the game and i just face the same 4-5 teams over and over, anyway that led to me just joining games with randoms. I went from 500+ to 400, slowly crawling back around 450 now and again, only with randoms. 
---
It doesn't matter if he stops them from attacking the middle but you walked up to the robots at the top and ruined it
---
chances of having an idea added to the game
---
*ZERO*
---
The main reason for me to stop playing CR consistently is  that most of my time and money has been devoted to Brawl Stars.  I have been playing inconsistently since beta but have somehow managed to get most of my brawlers max or near max.  While initially I played with only a few brawlers and I really didn't "get" how some are played, I eventually came around and enjoyed the variety each brawler had to offer.
---
Unlike in CR where I have only 1 viable ladder deck and at this point, I may be a year away from maxing another deck.  
---
it could also be Im getting tired of the mechanics of CR.  In almost 3 years, the core is the same.  1v1 then 2v2.  Added modifiers like 3x elixir, sudden death, draft mode, classic deck but it just feel like its not enough.  Touchdown mode is a bust for me.   The new arenas basically dont affect gameplay
---
Brawl Stars is great right now but I cannot really say if I'll be playing after 3 years.  
---
Perfection.

---
I considered it reflecting damage, but it might be too OP.  Negating damage is pretty darn useful on its own, you can block for others, while making the opposing brawler waste a round of ammo. I considered it having some damage, but then thought if it did any damage at all it might be too much value. How about I buff the last hit, to offset the lack of damage in the first hit. For some reason I really like it at 0, you might be right though.

 Thank you.

then how you screenshoted the first pic?
---
 
---
How do you do the exploit 
---
Same
---
I knowbut the thirst thing i think was....
---
Outstanding move
---
You would save 50 gems, not get the 30 gems back. 
---
The difference between a 6 and a 10 is really not that big stat wise.  Yes you have star powers but this game allows level 5 and 6 brawlers to get up to the top at 500 trophies without having to spend obscene amounts of money.  It‚Äôs one of the least p2w games I‚Äôve played in a while.
---
Lol the skin idea before the brawlerüòÇüòÇ
---
He will be very strong in a team composition, so probably best in gem grab since i dont rlly see a spot for him in heist.
---
True.  Mortis is hardly played outside BB.  But a lot of good Mortis players use him in Gem Grab so this buff will allow Mortis to be played even more.  There' s a chance that will be an indirect nerf to lobbers
---

Thanks for this had 30 gems laying around and I kinda love the new rico design so I might play him some more 
---
Lmao, I never changed it. There was a time when I tried to main Rico, but I suck with. That was near to the android release and I was new in the subreddit so... That's why lol. 
---
I think I'm gonna try to make a concept, I really like the idea!
---
Wait, for real???
---
It happened with me last week its bug i think.

Ehh not really that much it‚Äôs like an extra $3 for anyone buying and some more effort for free to play players

no it‚Äôs actually 2 streams, if you look carefully they aren‚Äôt in a straight line, it‚Äôs 3 from each guns, alternating, for a total of 6 per reload
---
So you‚Äôre that one guy...
---
99999999% there not free so 3
---
I guess so.  It gives him a slight edge (2 tiles vs 4 tiles before).  The added damage will help but I feel it doesnt make up for the star power nerf.  Only time will tell

why was this downvoted you poor soul

Contact Player Support through the game, they can restore your account provided the information you have given here is correct. If Supercell ID was used and you lost access to your email account, you need to check-in with your email provider in most cases. There's technically no way to connect a Supercell ID and then it becomes "disconnected" - i.e. if you started the connection process and you didn't verify the key from the email, it will not connect obviously.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: **Contact Player Support.**
---
He meant actual chars, skins to make the chars look like them is something else.
---
Long as the brawler still acts the same

A skin is fine

I‚Äôm more annoyed that Footbull and Brocks skins were both fan created and got 0 credit from Supercell. Supercell is going to make money off fan ideas, and the fans won‚Äôt even get the exposure or thanks they deserve. That‚Äôs not cool.
---
Except the new rico is gayyy
---
I'm sure they're working on it. 
---
I didn't like Clash Royale's Clan Wars feature.  I hope Brawl Stars come up with something more engaging
---
Yeah... Randoms
---
Most crawlers that deal more damage close range have much higher attack close range, so I doubt he's a shotgunner. My guess is he has more Nita's range, but doesn't pass through brawlers. It would be excellent attack for that range and his amount of health.
---
How? Do u have the dev build?
---
Yes mega box offer for 49 gems is the best value
---
Lol this is bullshit Brock with 4 skins and we have 5  brawlers without alternative skins.
---
The point of this is to make you play every single mode.
---
Too bad, this is a team game
---
This ain't my first rodeo
---
It was a joke
---
You're still pretty new at 2700 trophies. You might even have more brawlers then average. 
---
Jeeeeez, sounds like I don't have much to complain about. Frank's probably the epic I'd want the most too. Cheers :)
---
No hat , no buy
---
Haha ü§£ 
---
That happens only when she gets her star powet
---
Oh yikes. You older players must hate my 1000 trophy legendary bullshit friend more than I do
---
Maybe its droppin later
---
Fairs, cheers :)
---
Its in the middle of an animation...
---
THICCOCHET has grown on me lmfao.
---
Happy bday
---
Yeah lol I was just gonna comment this
---
I want the super to stay as its , its alot more fun to play with like this
---
On 3rd feb xd, but thx, u2 ;)
---
Do you get any credit for your work from Supercell?
---
I love the new ricochet skin(-:
---
Wait I don't get it
---
I don't think so, supercell started to make brawlers already in 3D,they remodel the other ones because they were made in 2D,still good joke tho
---
Oh shit they actually made spike look worse 
---
You are the second most dirty rat in the game.
---
Straight to hell
---
Bruh I spent 10 of them on event tickets. I had 28 gems beforem
---
Darrly is orphan of this game.
---
Thx!
---
Brock can go find someone else, it ain't the end of the world for him.
---
Really cool Chinese new year dragon style!!! 
---
10/10 ign
---
Giving the ball to the enemy is theoretically good to waste their ammo, but especially with shooting costing ammo I think simply gaining possession to score is a counterplay
---
This looks like it came from one of those mystery figure boxes they sell at GameStop. It‚Äôs that good. 
---
That would actually be a good idea to sell ü§î 
---
They should 200% put this in the game
---
Developer version...
---
There's something about Sakura Spike that makes it look creepy but I can't put my finger on it.
---
Thanks, but i don't think so, if they put my description in the game I would be a happy valentine's day for me=) (no gf feels bad) 
---
huh? where can I see this?
---
I like Lex the most among the famous brawl stars youtubers but from what I've seen in their interviews (which was conducted by Lex himself), all voices were doing by professional and experienced voice actors.  It may sound like a good idea to have Lex do a voice but Supercell may have a good reason not to get him (for now).  Like Lex does his youtube channel on the side (which is amazing with how great his videos are).  He does have a full time job so his availability may be an issue.  
---
Anyway, Im just speculating here.  Only Supercell and Lex can answer this if they wish to do so.
---
Yes, yes, yes!
---
Hol' up. 
---
And still no bo remodel
---
 No, just no
---
Oh well okay then. Thanks for info 
---
He needs a remodel, first.
---
\*GoldFather
---
He‚Äôs right tho
---
yeah but loaded rico has a hat
---
We cant play Blitzcrank or Thresh on brawl stars, they are from another game
---
They sayed i do inproppriate language idk man that sucks. Im over 4k 
---
Time to get good at strafing nerd
---
Lol same, cause I don‚Äôt trust randoms that time :/
---
Ric and Morti
---
The mask just reminds me of Mr. incredible in drag
---
If you saw the trailer, He keeps one gun in his holster while he walks around with the other one.
---
Yea, the skin will cost 80 gems, but now it costs only 30 gems
---
What software do you use to make the graphics?

---
No problem
---
Well, goodbye hat, my friend
---
Wow, Leon IS a true savage
---
Scorched stone 2.0
---
I use Sketch to make it, and then i've added gene and the text with PixelLab

---
Why?
---
Hahaha! Reminded me of the game called Pocket Mortys.
---
No
---
I gotta Hand it to you, that looks so legit, if I didn‚Äôt know any better I would have thought you took a screenshot from gameplay, great job man, keep up the great work! 
---
#Piperfuckedarobot
---
Thanks for the support man! I appreciate it! 
---
*He has some dark plans*
---
But tbh the brawler has a high chance to be a this type
---
Thx
---
If the skin costs 150 gems, probabl
---
If it cost 80... it was a good dream
---
Damn i never thought i would want a skin to be expensive 
---
Crow IS op when in the right hands,his poison helps your opponents not regenerate health.
---
Nerf confirmed
---
Thx, I will.
---
Just silently sitting in a band with nothing else to do
---
Sad
---
Yup, I regret buying the skin now
---
Thx, I don't really know what you mean, an imgur link or something different?
---
I guess
---
Ryan said end of January so Wednesday or Thursday 
---
"... as things should be."
---
Tickets, gold, key doubler, free box
---
Mega boxes are a waste of money, get the skin trusss me
---
If it said inappropriate language then you must‚Äôve used ... you guessed it, inappropriate language. Supercell doesn‚Äôt just ban you for no reason. 
---
The brock, colt and darryl skin will come out with the update on end of january, the poco skin at valentines day, football bull at the start of the super bowl and i don't really know when popcorn rico will drop, but i think it will also be in the next few months
---
We don‚Äôt know, it might be a surprise that they will wait until the update to show us :)
---
You tryna dethrone me from spot on number one
---
Because Supercell is not Epic Games to make all Brawlers as muscular or not obese
---
Whos this lost sassy child
---
Do you know if any will be free like wizard barely and 2018 Shelly. Also thanks for the info.
---
Awasome!!!
---
In my opinion crow is op especially when he controls the mid in gem grab
---
Not really funny, just edgy.
---
Welp,i already have 2 mythic characters,need one more.
---
Yeah I did not know how much damage it could do, but I knew it could do more than 30%
---
uwuwuwuwu
---
u/BEEFJAKE posted this on August 11th. Mine was July 26th.  
---
Yeahh
---
I am a victim of this lmao
---
If you did not get it immediately, anytime inbetween now and the end of the game. 
---
Nah bro his face looks actually way less smooth and clean, damn look at that pink skin I paid 100 gems for that, it uses to be cute, now I looks like a freak 
---
What you don't realize is that I only play 20 minutes a day.
---
Clash royale and clash of clans both updated this morning so it seems that brawl should update today too. But maybe they want to do their own thing. 
---
Probably not today though
---
So far there‚Äôs not much lore other then character discriptions in game.

To fit in better to the game's theme I'd call him Zen

The only thing I know is that Pam is Jessies mom.

Nice! I will pish mortis in this map!

look some gameplay of darryl,decide if you like him after that.

Nooooooo.

dying to leon = ur own fault, dying to teamers = unfair advantage since 2v1

Yeah or today or tommorow because they said that the new special skins coming on the new chinese year and thise is tomorow

No, get two 1k token doublers, you will get him with 40 boxes for sure.

R.I.P Brock, Mortis and Ricochet‚Äôs hats.

He deserve a brawler of his creation whit hes voice in coopoeration whit supercell ofcourse
---
My only question is how did everyone getting brawler icons next to their name?
---
I know but it was not in BS and obviusly I adapted the idea to be ballanced in BS
---
When‚Äôs season 1 coming?
---
Or leon is a nobody because he has no life
---
But they didn't mention a bundle in the video, so why would that help?
---
Why every attack blue in colour man!?
---
NEED 6 MORE REEEEEEE 
---
If that‚Äôs the only reason that‚Äôs pretty meaningless. Rarities are based on the uniqueness of a brawler, so they won‚Äôt necessarily be the same amount in each rarity.
---
In the next frame, I can imagine "Oh no! She found me!".
---
I'M aLReAdY LEoN
---
??? Actually everyone did and there are already tons of memes mentioning it
---
Bro if you just play normally and out of nowhere a Leon that was invisible autoaims you twice there‚Äôs nothing you could have done. It‚Äôs like if there‚Äôs a Bull camping in a bush, except you can‚Äôt see the Bush so you can‚Äôt pre-fire him
---
Yes, I know, but in case you haven‚Äôt realized, he has more advanced mechanics than most brawlers
---
I know really, and totally understand it and how to do it ( took graphic design as a minor in college ) just can't stand when someone assumes it rather than just explains it out like you did.. you know? if you look at his posts that seems to be all he does in others threads as well, thus my response being as lengthy as it was. 
---
Yeah, this was before I kept scrolling down the Reddit page.

Cool, thanks.

Spike's remodel is just a color change. That shouldn't be taken as a remodel per se.

*cough * backslide and pushback *cough*

Can‚Äôt change her anymore since the 3D model have all ready been made etc, but we are doing another one in the future, if you have any good ideas we are happy to get some! :D

Many people always ask me how I was able to get into Harvard as a 16 year old who skipped 3 grades of high school. They think I got in because of my scholarly records, but no the key is the interview. As I sat in the Harvard Dean's office in front of the board of reviewers for my application, the Dean asks me "Why should you be a good candidate for this school?" They seemed bored but I replied "Well I was born a child prodigy, placed 1st in my state spelling bee for three consecutive years, I can speak eight different languages not counting Latin, play four different instruments, I skipped grades 4 through 6, and graduated my high school as valedictorian at the age of 14. I then worked as an intern at both Telsa, and NASA." Suddenly the room burst into laughter and many of board instantly started scribbling down "No" near the application check marks. The Dean says "Sorry but you are just not the type we are looking for." But then I said "Excuse me but I wasn't finished... I watch Rick and Morty" The Dean looked at me like an idiot and said "So....?" Then I replied with a smile "And I understand all the references and subtle jokes" An audible gasp let out by the board was so loud the secretary had to come in. You could hear a pin drop and then suddenly all at once the entire board clicked their pens on the "Approved Box" and I was instantly handed a diploma and now I'm teaching advanced physicals there. I guess you can say I'm pretty smart. :)
---
it‚Äôs a good deal, but i might wait for pop corn rico
---
Or they are getting a bunch of people who would have never spent 80(or 59 on sale) gems on the skin to spend 30 gems. I don't like rico and there is a lot of other characters I would rather have a skin for, but I also now own the gold rico skin.
---
oh yes the renders down images
---
The problem isn't Shelly, it's how they play it. It's basically a 2v3 the entire time
---
My favorite brawler is Barley and rico please not insuit ricoüò≠üò≠üò≠
---
Thank you for taking the time to write all this for me, I‚Äôll keep it in mind
---
this is the rebuild
---
Ok i just think that gold rico is better
---
omg you just fed the clickbaiters.
---
Because they are targeting on kids mostly. Most of the changes (UI, remodels, skins, etc) for the past 4 months were all childish. All design changes that would satisfy kids from 10 to 16 yo.
---
should probably get used to it
---
The more they cost the better they are! 100% scientifically proven fact!
---
PREPARE FOR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT

Thx :3

Colt: I'm calling the devs
---
Although im happy with all the remodels, I think it's odd that Bo didn't get one. I guess it makes sense as Darryls and Pocos remodels were made because of incoming skins and Rico and Colt really needed remodels (idk about Spike, maybe because of Sakura Spike). Atleast Bo gets a voice.
---
That's true. Based on the posts in this sub that makes too much sence.
---
its for ppl who have more than 10$

*SUPERCELL WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION*
---
Not sure how I feel about Thiccochet
---
Thanks for the comment! I'm no good at balance, but the idea of a "pacificist" character isn't quite a prefect fit, but I designed the core ideas of his moveset to be defensive and avoid, and to deal damage as a last resort.  I based the core concept off of Aang and other airbenders in ATLA, who were considered pacifists and how they "fought" which is by doing everything in there power not to fight by dodging and avoiding.  First attack I settled on 0, because being able to negate damage has quite a lot of value, giving it any damage at all would allow you to always have a net positive with any exchange. Hope that makes sense :)
---
Thinking the same thing 
---
I know it's "whole" not "hole", just my keyboard didn't realized that I pressed "w".
---
I‚Äôm actually kinda excited. I miss playing on that map. It‚Äôs honestly so much better than hot garbage
---
Why the hell it reminds me of undertale ?
---
They felt the power of music.
---
Looks like he went from adult Poco to kid Poco

Is it just me or does Lex low-key look like mortis?

Alright so ditching a western theme = childish? That‚Äôs so dumb. Besides, if the game was stuck to a western theme, it would be hard for them to push new content that isn‚Äôt Western related. Your logic baffles me

What will the update change about this tho

Thank you! I hope I can make the next one better than this one :)

Woah

Yup. They just became my number one target and I'll push them into everyone else. If they have to team then they are weak and should die first.

You‚Äôre one to talk about temper tantrums.
---
If you could fill me in on what you asked me in your previous comment, I‚Äôd be glad to answer. All I see is shitty insults with no basis in truth.
---
I‚Äôm sorry my arguments are too complicated for you to understand, but it didn‚Äôt take too long for me to show that your points meant nothing. 
---
I have nothing to prove to you. The fact that I said I was 22 should show you that. If I felt the need to lie, I *would‚Äôve* said I was older than that. But I don‚Äôt need to. So I didn‚Äôt. I just find it amusing that you‚Äôre either too dumb to see the hypocrisy in your words, or too stubborn to admit it. 
---
I think we both know you fucked up trying to bring that bullshit to me. Next time you try to put someone in their place, try not to make conjectures about a person‚Äôs age/occupation without any sense of truth. It completely ruins your credibility.
---
Or, you could parry the first shot, then backslide and retreat. If they give chase, use pushback. If they still chase, use pushback again, or if you have 2 slots use backslide. Not that difficult to wrap your head around.
---
I really dislike the redesign of ricochet. Why are they changing him?
---
NoOne likes Jessie huh?

Not the same

First of all you probably don't understand how people get this information. After every client update new information is put into the files. This will not be the end to new brawlers, these are just all that are in the files. Expect new leaks this upcoming update.

Yeah why not

Yes they did. Its staying on 80 gems

Good point. Revision required! thanks
---
Different guitar, red bow tie, shorter, different skull color. There‚Äôs a lot going on for the remodel
---
Correct. the special obstacles would only appear in each appropriate mode.
---
Yea i saw it in sensei adam og vids
---
Nope barley was literal aids 
---
they said that in the brawl talk i believe 
---
The strongest choices...
---
hahahahaha I can imagine his voice rocking in my head while Slash makes his guitar sing ü§ò
---
I didn‚Äôt watch that talk
---
I don't see why your first move isn't allowed to deal damage. I mean you're literally spinning a stick. hitting someone with a spinning stick up close should be able to deal some damage. It adds more versatility to his kit, either use your first ammo to parry or you use your first ammo to deal some damage on melee. think about it this way. More options means better design because you give the player more choices to make and picking the right choice will feel rewarding. 
---
Also another concern of mine is that just parrying sounds like extremely boring gameplay. Also you haven't specified how long this parry ability lasts. too short and it'll be useless against the likes of rico and colt. too long and it'll be rly annoying in a melee fight unless you can cancel the parry with your second attack, (in which case your first shot will still be useless in a melee fight if it deals no damage)
---

If fits more in this , i didn't find an cool high quality image of normal mortis running

This is nice work! I love the mole design, and definitely like the digging mechanics! Very unique, and would love see this in the game :)

Back during the gold rush, miners would bring the birds into mines because the birds would die when there was radiation and then the miners would go back to avoid radiation poisoning

Is cool but I hope that he will come back as askin
---
It's a bless for - relatively seen - 'weaker' brawlers in showdown like Tara or mortis. But I can see your point because I often get teamed off and playing 1 v 3 isn't quite funny. Or playing Leon nowadays where everyone is teaming against you.

Wednesday or Thursday. It‚Äôs already 18:30 in Finland, too late for an update 
---
Well I mean uhhhhhhhhhhh she's like 15 so uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
There is a possibility that the graphic will be changed in the next update
---
Seems really nice üòã
---
Cool idea bro ! 
---
EEEEEELLLL PRIMOOOOOO
---
For you android users the blue dot next to the name means it was updated recently
---
I hate randoms that free me when i want max tokens
---
How was Pocho remodelled? And Spike and Darryl? I can't see any differences?
---
New Poco model looks crispy 
---
b u l l

Take my upvote,comrade! 
---
Brock is rocket girl :o
---
I've made a concept of a brawler too ! His name is Dr . Mole ... Check it out in my profile ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Please be trolling
---
No hat Mortis is good though, well... hat Mortis is worst
---
Yeah... please don't lol

I was joking but yeah i get it

**FOOTBULL** - Super Bowl (Feb 4).

**Valentines POCO** - Valentines Day (Feb 14).

Just to clarify, these are just **speculations**!
---
How was pocho remodelled? Can't see any difference
---
rico gold skin now is awesome
---
I think middle of next month. But balance changes at the end of this month. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong
---
Lol it‚Äôs true ^^
---
Where?
---
It still wouldn‚Äôt have been funny but atleast t would‚Äôve made sense!
---
Yeah ik
---
Please don‚Äôt use another person‚Äôs content to advertise your own. Just a tip for the future.
---
This is an amazing concept!üòç I would love to play with this brawler and I hope they put him in the game ! üíúüíúüíú
---
rico is now the long lost robot brother of primo with that skin 
---
Thanks
---
Well good sir I see that we have a disagreement
---
You are Neznayka)
---
Ya I noticed it earlier only bro üòä
---
Yeah)
---
So first of all. get matched against Mortis Frank and primo. Your parry is 100% completely useless that match. If you think that's healthy design, then i don't know what else to say to you. And let me remind you your combo resets if you wait too long with attacks or finish your combo. which means you'll be wasting an ammo for parry every. single. time. that you even try to do something.
---
2. You say 'if they still chase, use pushback again' but the way OP said it, its literally impossible to do pushback twice in succession. he specifically says 'ammo recharge= combo reset. This willl have the weirdest interaction ever because ammo recharges indefinitely even mid combo. So lets say you parry and backslide quickly in succession, by the time you finish backslide an ammo might have recharged before you cast pushback, which would reset your combo. OP should be more clear on this.
---
3. Stop downvoting my comments because you disagree. everytime you downvote me ill downvote you back.
---
HOW DO I PUT THE BRAWLER NEXT TO MEH NAME
---
r/bamboozleinsurance
---
Wtf i just asked for your opinion greedy ****
---
Gotta pump up those numbers while you can lol. He will still be good after the update, but no more 2 super victories 
---
No i dont think so
---
It is an leak. It is not mine it's Acr1's
---
Exactly this
---
Thank you! Lol
---
Frank
---
Yeah I understand the weaker bralwers point but teaming is not fun when it is against you. I was recently in a game where 5 brawlers were following each other around not attacking.
---
He's more vibrant.
---
Hopefully they re-work her star power, maybe something like her shots now deal damage through brawlers same as Nita, Tara, PoCo, frank, etc. 
---
No don‚Äôt do it
---
420/69
---
On,y wrong if you think about it the wrong way. Personally I quite like the Beauty and The Beast dynamic, although it wouldn't be my no. 1 ship lol
---
it‚Äôs not russian 
---
:l
---
It‚Äôs Still extremely  unfair for the outsider players who don‚Äôt even get a chance to join, or team with someone else. Basically the only option is to run away until you get cornered 
---
Primo would be unstoppable 
---
The fact that Darryl has soy sauce guns instantly wins me over.
---
Better than the current skin
---
YYYEEEEAAAHHHHH BBBOOOOIIIIIII
---
Spicymike has a little chick under his hat

because mostly all of the time super cell usually post their games at the end of a month.

For some reason this reminds me of that flash bomb game

His name is Geneeeeee

Wooow, what a dick

I live in South Africa so I could only get it at the launch of global but that‚Äôs what I call a smart business investment right there

It do be like that

Your chances are pretty decent I think you‚Äôve just gotten unlucky my friend 
---
Nice

Dam Nibba thats a good skin

I got leon in 15 boxes after the release lol

downvote cuz u have that cringey app

Why 
---
That‚Äôs all I have to say
---
The gumball Rico is his original skin, the Gem Rico is replacing the golden Rico skin and the popcorn Rico is a new skin 
---
Cool, hope they give credit.
---
Uh you can‚Äôt one shot him with mortis. Anyway this ironic posts aren‚Äôt even funny
---
The dilema of my life
---
Op
---
Cause I don‚Äôt wanna Play with 12+ years old. Rage is real 
---
Wow it must have been a shitty game then. For the matchmaking all they do is average out the trophies so like I‚Äôll have 2 team mates with like 10-15 and they‚Äôll have 2 people in the same range and one other higher up person. Which is total garbage. The balance in showdown is complete ass because all the maps are heavily factored to melee burst brawlers so that‚Äôs all you end up seeing as you climb in solo. In comparison to clash royal they have an active upgrade system whereas this one is passive with few options and shitty. Like you never feel like you‚Äôre getting anywhere in terms of brawler progressions and what not. It‚Äôs just trash
---
Nah
---
WHY?
---
I won‚Äôt quit mate it‚Äôs just a game

But then somebody gets Leon

Dev build with remodel

Ok thanks

I will miss the skill ceiling of the super.

Would insta cop

1. you don't 2. if you look at the username it says Coach Cory. YouTubers get special developer versions that have all the new stuff
---
GOOD CHANCES

She is gooooooooooooooooooooood in some showdowns

no u

That's actually pretty cool

Sometimes I die because I didn't destroy them and I get stuck because they blocked my path &gt;:\[

Thanks!

I downvoted that too lmao

Boom beach...
---
Np. I like how the vaults are in the middle of a water patch
---
You must have terribly low self esteem to feel the need to insult other people based on their opinions üòâ
---
Darryl isnt in the gang yet sadly ;_; but he will be chinese soon 
---
Spike looks much better
---
So Bull, Primo, Mike, Darrly, Crow and Piper. And maybe Gene and Tara could pull people across?
---
Rip Bull in this map
---
5/5 I already bought it and the animation is too cool
---
Nigel Thornberry
---
I am pretty bored xD (and I want to have some karma) üòÄüòÄ

And maybe 1000 ticks of poison seems resonable enough 
---
Yaahhh...if I controlled Rewind, I'd want Brawl Stars, and Mark-ass Brown Lee 
---
You lost
---
I hate Bull :) .I wish the Bulls hadn't been played on that map. 
---
Small details the guitar is more a banjo and the song notes are less far apart, the skinny legs are gone and over all looks cuter, as for Darryl they kept orettt much same the eye has more life in it and I think maybe a bit wider on the barrel, slightly bigger cap &amp; emblem, and for spike the eyes and mouth are bigger and closer, the pinky is amazing now cause it‚Äôs got girly eyes which is the point of it being pinky. Overall nice touches
---
Colt just got a sunburn lol
---
A lot betterüíöüíÄ‚ò†Ô∏è
---
But the skill level can also be changed or they are as bad as they look? 
---
I‚Äôm still gonna miss old Rico tho, they should have one grandfathered skin option imo
---
SPPPIIIKKKKKEEEEE CEEENNNAAAAAA
---
Not he has skins and Voice acting*right now*
---
And Bots can be high rarity Brawlers?
---
In my point of view, no
---
I think so. I‚Äôve been trying but I only have two.
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
u/memeeconomy

u couldn‚Äôt see much difference in the skin for rico when u bought it vs the stock one

---
The video was funny uwu
---
The poor guy that spawns outside and has to watch
---
You are leon, the most op brawler. So I don't feel sympathetic towards you. 
---
Why not? I just maxed him and it's rly fun
---
Darryl will be the best star power, with the bo's nerf
---
This looks really cool, but hard af to implement/think through in a game. 
---
Wish I had rico right now.
---
Confirmed 
---
Oh my god that kept happening to me too, one of them went up there within 30 seconds. It was unbelievably fucking frustrating and I have no idea why they are doing it
---
What video
---
Yay, Blitzcrank in Brawl Stars.
---
No shit, we android users aren't stupid lol.
---
Haha same. 
---
So cool broo
---
:^/Ooooooooh nvm,but anyways good bye
---
Hope u like it! upvote to include in the update!! hehe
---
Made my day lol
---
You should draw a dragon on the umbrella or at least some yellow
---
This is such facts people just started playing it in my school. But the issue is when they ask how many trophies I‚Äôm at and I say 2000 and they ask when I stated playing and I say October 2018 they call me a loser. But it doesn‚Äôt matter because I have more trophies than them
---
Got Leon before getting El Primo lol 
---
One thing, because of how much clutter there is in the pic the ‚Äúbrawl stars‚Äù is a bit messy and hard to read. Other than that it‚Äôs really good

Wow, thats Gene-ius!
---
Sorry, i‚Äôll stop.
---
Now this looks fun.
---
I agree but what point would he really have 
---
Maybe just my opinion then.
---
real? 
---
I know, I Just didn't knew how to change that, thx for the feedback!

Bug

Clubs could be better optimized by having them offer exclusive game modes to play with your club mates, or club tournaments, like in clash royale, where you are matched up against other clubs and compete to gather the most wins in game modes for prizes
---
Try darkening everything right around it and very slowly make it brighter towards the outside
---
Thank u all I will try wait but I cant understand why my friends have bigger luck than meü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èill wait
---
32 tokens each ticket in robo rumble max reward. U can set 20 tickets max in one match so it is 640 tokens each map. 60tickets cost 80gems in short 80 gems = 1920 tokens so almost 20 chests or in easy 24 tokens for 1gem. Token doublers on the other hand are 50gems for 1000tokens which converts to 20tokens per gem.
---
Only thing that isn't real for me? 
---
"3/3 Mythical Brawlers"
---
Unlocked spike today at 3000 trophies 
---
Well, in any way, I still think buying the box is worse, just for the luck factor.
---
19/22. Hit 9k last night and reset brought me back to 8850
---
Yeah but you also lose so much. Especially when u get more trophies. This would help with -8 when u come like 8. But if u killed the 2 other people u would lose 2 less
---
Nice!
---
Lmao. Whoops. 
---
If u want i can upload the blonde version of this design! 
---
My friends dont play mobile games, and playing with randoms is a pain when they're brain dead
---
Darryl is an amazing brawler, he was incredibly broken before and needed every nerf they gave him. 
---
The things that makes him so difficult compared to other shotgun brawlers is not just his low health and short dash but the nature of his attack. 
---
Because I his attack shoots from his right shotgun and then the second shotgun it is slow and doesn‚Äôt get max damage unless you are really close to the enemy, this means in order to use all of his stats to his highest potential you CANNOT be lazy, you have to aim the super perfectly every time and get right on top of your enemies.
---
As a Tara player, I don't understand this.
---
Don‚Äôt ever ask for upvotes
---
"Reality is often disappointing"
---
All credits to Coach Cory.

Do check out his video https://youtu.be/PrTtesPKBYI where he has discussed them in detail...

darryl looks the same for me

None of you are gods if you are under 9000... unlike me ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
He was am angry soldier, became an angry king and died AND BECAME A FUCKIN' ANGRY SKULL
---
No 
---
That‚Äôs awesome! üëçüèª 
---
Nice, now stick a few needles in him
---
Who created Rico?
---
I love this but highly doubt that it will become a skin..... 
---
And a pointy chest 
---
I got 18 coins... (I‚Äôm maxed too)
---
I don't know but it's going to be hard to save up boxes until then!
---
I....you....who loses 30-40 trophies to get one star? I just.....just stop it. 
---
[https://crux.page.link/y7sd](https://crux.page.link/y7sd)
---
I started playing on global and got spike today
---
You‚Äôre an idiot, of course you get 20 chests in the end, 10 of which you would‚Äôve gotten anyway even if you bought the token doubler or not. Token doubler = 50 gems for 10 boxes = 5 gems per box
---
Mega box = 49 gems for 10 boxes = 4.9 gems per box
---
If you buy the mega box offer you save a gem... it‚Äôs something I guess
---
In the next update... 
---
*Barley approaches the safe*
---
*Barley fires his super*
---
Me: Cyka blyat
---
Yeah but they just need to cycle the maps in a set rotation  otherwise it would be hard to find enough players for all the different maps
---
Bullshit you must have taken long breaks
---
...but... he does have a bow...
---
Oh my God, that's just what I thought when I first saw what the shadow of the new brawler, I was like: "Nice, Lancer is coming to brawl stars!"
---
Same here, dunno what supercell was thinking
---
The luck increases in the same way wether you open 1 big or 10 normal boxes 
---
Give him donut sleeves 
---
"But can you do this?" 
---
5/5 I think his animations are cool, somehow different from the main one.
---
Uhh Nita isn‚Äôt getting any buffs...
---
happy cake day
---
Why though? In Clash Royale they used to reappearü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I highly doubt the hitbox will change 
---
But most gamemodes have teams of 3...
---
bull gon take it man, every single time
---
Me too, even though I hate playing primo id buy it cause mega knight is my favourite CR troop
---
Ikr lmao

We must team for the motherland!
---
So true it hurts
---
we gotta go on strike until they give us our boy back. 
---
Also many heist maps are getting the wall removed that's in front of the same. A nerf to all throwers in heist  
---
Also that wall wont be there 
---
Your choice:D
---
yea i love them
---
ive had an el primo as my teammate once. safe to say that halfway into the game I simply gave up because no matter how much you kill, el primo always gave score to opponent
---
Idk, maybe it's to do with me being at 6k trophies = basically opened loads of boxes by now. But at the same time i've been lucky, the only brawlers that i'm missing are Piper, Crow and Leon
---
Make animal bull and then that would be a quality meme
---
They said green bushes dont grow back so maybe snake prarie's yellow bushes do
---
I thought the same thing
---
I'm going to open them all now, because right now I have a 50% chance of getting Mortis as a mythic. after Gene is released it will go down to 33%, and I want Mortis.
---
Maybe Tara is a male ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îüò≤
---
I was proud I didnt get him. Instead that weekend I used leon counters heavily and got a big burst of trophy push. 
---
No we dont
---
No way they will even think about putting it on PS4/Xbox but switch possibly
---
It should be Thiccochet rather than gene
---
Not trying to be rude, but if you are getting annoyed by repetitive posts, you can ignore them. 
---
Every time I see matchmaking  posts I just keep scrolling. It‚Äôs not that hard...
---
Are they annoying? Yes I get annoyed, and I‚Äôm sure everyone else does too.
---
there are countless thiccochet posts and you‚Äôre gonna bash on this guy?
---
No hate... just saying, if you‚Äôre getting annoyed... just continue on.
---
It's actually a Nerf to bull and el primo because they use the wall to collect their super and distract.
---
No, gene will be released mid-february
---
You‚Äôre welcome, and thanks for taking my ideas to consideration.
---

Actually, once he reaches level 35 he‚Äôll be able to get it again.
---
I got 2 mega boxes, 10 big boxes and 240 normal boxes saved up for gene
---
o
---
That meme has already been done. And Animal is a different brawler
---
At first, it's warm, then it gets cold
---
heck yeah. i already have 4 big boxes and 25 brawl boxes saved man.
---
No problem.
---
This meme never gets old
---
The brawl fan puns are FANtastic
---
What doy you mean lol, that‚Äôs the reason he‚Äôs getting the deal to begin with, how is he gonna reach level 35 2 times üòÇ
---
When they call stormy a "new" map
---
They are just traps
---
Bull x10
---
Very accurate 
---
Rip

If someone dont get it animal is leaked brawler in game code his sp give him abbility to heal 500 hp for 1 sec when you are in bush

I dont speak croissant

Got all brawlers except for the legendaries. Bought one epic and mythic brawler, the rest was pulled from free boxes
---
Not gonna lie, I actually want a fat poco skin now
---
And they were saying that piper sucks at heist...
---
Which is why I posted this. I want to give awareness as much as I can.
---
Only once? Lucky! 
---
Tennis. Nice
---
Dang you're me but better
---
The shit posting on this sub is far superior to the Clash Royale and Clash of Clans subreddits.
---
Original
---
Pretty sure Mortis is a Vampire. I mean, he sends forth a wave of vampire bats at ya, his eyes, his white pale skin. He ain't normal :&lt;
---
They honestly could've done this instead of adding a 4th brock skin
---
Lime this
---
Add a 4th slot, I guess. It'a not that complicated.
---
The mega knight exists a bit before brawl stars yet no one has ever made this concept:
---
This is beyond science!
---
Add more slits or take one away
---
Also didn't realize I created an autistic thread of "jokes on you" comments lol
---
https://youtu.be/S1Z4q0iuJ4Y
---
tbh they could make a Scare Crow skin for Crow
---
Yea I just hit 10k and people think it‚Äôs cool they hit 1k.
---
Cool. I'm saving boxes to get him when he releases
---

February 1st- the middle of February 
---
Thank you, please share this post for the supercell to see. thank you again
---
Everyone does this and I still love them. I hate that these were removed
---
The only downside is that it would have to be gifted to everyone in the spirit of communism 
---
Thank you, please share
---
Cant afford gems, can affor mobile device. Hmmmmm.
---
r/UnexpectedTF2
---
Thank you, it's so good
---
A rename is on the way !
---
thank you, please share so the supercell see
---
But then look at Primo
---
He could have edited it to that color... he doesn‚Äôt know anything
---
Did they have some sort of extra token stuff for the christmas event? I really hope they do. Three skins isnt much of an event, not that I dont like the skins. 
---
Literally me saving up for a token doubler and then seeing king thicco
---
I wanna say tomorrow, just have a feeling but not certain. 
---
A good detailed post, I likey.

Sorry that I have nothing to add to this.

Thanks. All good. Hoping the right people look at it. 
---
Literally me
---
&gt;Rigged lag?
---
It's not rigged because you're losing. You're most likely losing because your connection is getting bad on you.

iN uR MoM stupid iDioT

Tara

Check out KyriosTime or look it up on youtube. There are plenty of great guides there.
---
Oh I thought you get something like 1 token per trophy for each brawler over 500. 
---
True, but Supercell killed him in his only game mode. Anyways, congrats on getting those three. Rico is nice, Tara is so versatile, and I always wanted to try Darryl out.

Thanks for the response. Just wondering how even if someone bought a lot of coins, where do the power points come from?
---
I thought he was an onion when I saw his outline 
---
What is sc
---
Looks like a good idea, it'd definitely spice up the game 
---
Just curious though, are you saying crest or chest?
---
And the chick with the umbrella is OP AF
---
Not chest. I believe it's called chrest. Correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Will the Gold Rico skin carry over when the update drops?
---
Leon is still a human he just has spiritual powers
---
Muito massa
---
Im so sad there wasnt any new SFX for Mortis's super, with so many new SFX for Brawlers i thought it would be cool to give him something shinier.
---
supercell 
---
I have 0.2496 for mythic. is that bad?
---
They said exactly on Wednesday 
---
Wow
---
The real point is there is none
---
that‚Äôs some dedication, i like it 
---
Does someone just buy loads of mega boxes until have enough?
---
Anyone know where I can find 3d model pngs of the brawlers?
---
Idk 
---
Wow kyriostime is he like kairostime‚Äôs brother or something
---
Nice little karma farm

Congrats

Amazing work bud!

What's so cool
---
Lol
---
So you could only move by tapping?
---
Top shelf meme
---
It's crest
---
I believe you‚Äôre trying to say crest, but I can‚Äôt be certain. Maybe try looking it up real fast to see if you‚Äôre misspelling it? Because if you‚Äôre trying to say chrest I have no idea what that could be
---
I didn't say it was on Wednesday I said it was February 1st - middle of February 
---
k then. sry for the grammar.
---
Still friends?
---
The other guy said Wednesday 
---
it's crest
