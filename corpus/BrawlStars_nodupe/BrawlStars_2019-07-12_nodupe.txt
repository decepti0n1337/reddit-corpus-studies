How heavy is the weight vest your wearing to stop you spinning?
---
Well that's your opinion
---
YESSSS
---
I think 400+.
---
They can ask for permission, and supercell really wanted to do crossover from games
---
This happened to me too
---
I am really trying to play w/o teaming (i know in this match it doesn't look like i am)
---
it's raining outside
---
Throwing the game away
---
😠😠😠 who are u say that i suck. did u play with me see that? i am gonna report u
---
But they made robo Mike spin
---
This is a playground for bull, dynamike and Bo
---
We all know whats the favorite buffet for mortis 😂
---
Please?!?
---
Eww I don't wanna eat that weird looking Dyna
---
In my opinion, linebacker bull is a waste of star points. 2,500 for a recolor is too much in my opinion.
---
Why did an account created just now got star shelly tho
---
Eu conheço alguns jeans, e nenhum deles tem grana rs
---
When you kill someone and Shelly pops up

I like Nita Gene Mortis and Spike the most tbh in no specific order

You have to wait until they come into the shop

Why is this nsfw
---
Randoms in a nutshell
---
One point of attacking in duo showdown is to take both members out before they can respawn.in your scenario you dont know if a brawler is waiting on a respawn.brawlers who are waiting normally avoid fights and run from enemies.when a player respawns they take a few seconds to appear out of the 'bubble' giving you time for your duo to adapt to an additional enemy.the invincibility neans that the brawler can temporarily  keep control and adapt to a situation allowing their duo to stay in the fight
---
I don’t know i just said that and it was actually a subreddit
---
Thank you, I would really like to go to the game.
---
Barley’s face is fucking fantastic
---
Open to suggestions on changes or additions but these are my main ideas for the character:
---
Fitz's main attack is a mid range lightning shock, however the longer the bolt is aimed for, the longer the range and damage. Before you say that I'm copying off Bibi's charged attack idea look at  the last post I made with my first idea about Fitz, and you will see it was posted waay before Bibi came out.
---
His super is a throwable emp bomb which stuns and damages enemies in its attack area
---
8/10 
---
Big hat
---
Nice 👌
---
I thought it was tick but when you said robó mike it makes more sense now :)
---
Are you really complaining about getting more trophies? Seriously?
---
Best buff for me
---
-don’t stuck in corners
---
-2.0 reload time
---
-1300 damage at max level
---

---
A Clockwork Orange
---
Google be like
---
Tap all images with restaurants
---
oh yeah I got all 3, haven’t unboxed a brawler besides Carl for about a year
---
I see people like this all the time. Who is so bad at the game that they even bother to spend money on it just to barley stay slightly behind all the OG F2ps
---
A chat system like clash royale would be a lot better

How do people get clips like this. Do people just record everything every time they play a game?

:O incrible

It ruined the game imo, there were soooo many better ways to get by the issue

Only true mexicans can :B

I feel like Leon just needs an occasional chuckle and spike should sound like maracas. I honestly have no idea what voice to give Daryl but it would be cool if it was stereotypical pirate speak but heavily robotised

And DONATERS

My drawing was not a "base", it was an original artwork. It wasn't made for people to trace over it. I accept your apology but don't accept your "credits", please take this post down.
---
You weren't "inspired" by it, you just traced it. I forgive you but please take this post down. It is still disrespectful.
---
not a restaurant, I misread cave as "cafe"

but its probably where snake prairie came from
---
Just wait till she shows up in the store

it's traced...😇🔪

Good what not city. (bcs we have it)

She never came up in the store

Yes that is the point

Hi ashriel
---
Looks like you are karma farming too
---
i once had my nita at 400, then below 300, knowing me and my luck it would have tooken me 2 weeks to get back up then eventually to rank 20, now it takes me 2 hours... way way way too easy to get brawlers to get to rank 20
---
Damn I posted this yesterday as well although not as well thought out as you. I think it would be my favorite game play. I love bounty but bad teammates can ruin it also I like Showdown but hate it at the same time.
---
i'm just saying this is a karma farm by saying it's fake, i don't think it's that hard...
---
Onde q eu desviei do assunto?? Kkkk

It is real how else would I have gotten 10 trophies I'm serious
---
I have played since global as well 11k trophies with 5 brawler above 500
---
Try using Frank, he’s probably the worst

kinda feel bad for you when you only had one epic at 7k trophies

nope it's before 2019 (global released in 2018 december when i downloaded the game)
---
:D🇧🇷
---
How dare you insult lord Poco. Actually a good tier list though
---
F for respect
---
new star power
---
Thanks :D
---
BROCK NO
---
Why
---
Yeah exactly. It was such a grind before and the first time I got a brawler to 500 I felt a sense of accomplishment. Now I know I’m not gonna have any trouble getting all of my brawlers to 500, it’s just gonna come down to putting in the time. From there when a season resets how can we tell the difference between 2 players skill level? It’s gonna get to the point where most people are rank 20. They are going to have to implement a system to tell a difference between someone who was able to get 1200 in a season or someone who just barely got to 500. I think it’s an easy fix if putting the highest trophies a brawler has gotten to next to their current trophies.
---
This is legit the first match you play
---
For im from ksa you say boo i talk is The idea is barter me gems or shapes or heroes or gold like I love Lyon and someone else hates Lyon and he has a Lyon and I have a hero and I have a union and I have Leon or he has a Crow and so I thought Emooji and exchange the Emooji only and I hope you put My Channel Name is Sonic one | سونيك
---
I thought of that one gravity falls short "Lefty" (if you know what that is)
---
This is my first and best showdown map. What are your thoughts about this new map idea? Click on link or picture to see the map. Thanks everyone for your support.
---
lol i've been playing for 6 months and im at 11.8k
---
No tier list viable, tiers are determined by each individual map, and have cannot generally be applied to the brawlers.
---
There he is!
---
Now we meet that meta post that calls out these kind of posts lmao
---
I'm proud of you my dude, I am struggling to hit 7k
---
He wont give credit dont worry. He's just using this for free content and to post his youtube link in your comment section
---
Wait there is  single teaming?
---
Don’t be mad it’s a joke
---
😂😂😂😂😂
---
Thank you for tips!
---
Oof for Mortis.
---
I looked at the new version, but unfortunately there wasn’t any improvement on the sides. Also, you’ve created another issue; 1-tile gaps. They’re a pain to walk through. Otherwise, it’s much better now.
---
I have struggles for 8k Congrats bro
---
So u have upgraded all Brawlers hah?
---
Mortis be like: Time to make some anti-tick-le serum and replace it with the anti-pickle serum
---
You FOOL. Your carelessness has cost you this game for you have activated my trap card.
---
Now face the horror of the legendary reverse card.
---
Np
---
And this is why you dont get so cocky on combat kids,you get reversed uno card
---
Then you can tell me if it’s good or not
---
I mean, it’s not exactly that he’s weak, his concept has a lot of flaws and bad matchups that just increase with the addition of new brawlers most of the time, yes, you can overcome them with experience and skill, but og players should remember, in beta he was more playable since you actually had to aim when other brawlers were near and you could trick people crossing them up, he could actually fight Shelly and Bull, even after his nerf, auto-aim was a huge indirect nerf to him, maybe a rework would be better
---
You’re missing the point of the post, he wants you to get trophies if you lag and win. I agree that ditching is rude, and that’s why you lose trophies for it
---
“Wow that Sux”
---
Not convinced yet
---
What is your trophy level they are so dumb
---
So this is why other people tell me that this subreddit is toxic...
---
Wow the new BRAWL STARS update looks cool
---
Same
---
1) Play Duos
---
2) Play Duos (Cause too players that don’t YouTube do)
---
3) Pick your brawler based on the map, not your desire to climb.
---
May May? MAY? *angry global release player noise*
---
477 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Appreciate the love also i got nothing from that box.  The only brawlers i need are tara and crow cmon supercell no 10k freebie?
---
I think Poco more need a ‘rework’ than a ‘buff’. His attack spread is so big that you can mostly auto-aim with that, but his damage is shit. I think they should make Super charge faster, attack spread -10% while adding his attack damage to more than 1k at level 7 so that he can 6 shot boxes in showdown, and increase the heal. Every brawler has its own modes and their own counters. Like you can’t buff Mortis so that he can 3 shot Bulls... While Poco is a support, he is supposed to heal a brawler more than deal damage, so he is not supposed to be good in Heist or Solo Showdown, he just needs some quality of life changes.
---
I am writing a Bible here
---
He need skill to be used... He is in a good place
---
You just auto-aimed whole time
---
Noice
---
They should make this as an optional setting, not mandatory
---
Idk why, but some of your artwork makes me feel *very* uncomfortable. It’s good art, but sometimes it gives me goosebumps.
---
what else are you supposed to do with el primo...
---
Dinamike, Barley, Tick and Rico: 😡

There is no good moves so

Poor Carl lol but then again if u rly wanted to kill Throwers just use Mortis as Relying on ur Super is Bad.
---
ok il delete :( i drew it for 1 hour
---
Good Job Supersell
---
It’s sometimes frustrating when I’m trying to win and a teammate just spins in a circle throwing :(
---
I’m only 5000 trophies and I don’t watch any streams, what’s the point in losing theologies for a character?
---
sorry for what happened, just imagined new things in attacks and I remembered a flamethrower, and then arose Anthony
---
Just type in google like taras restaurant
---
I saw worser
---
He said &gt;!STFU!&lt;
---
6666 tropheys
---
But this is supposed to be a “friendly game”
---
I skipped over all that.
---
As for the time&gt;skill, 500 didnt take skill because it was either achieved through teaming or camping.
---
This game also has a huge luck factor in the fights.
---
(I keep pairing with 4k players with 600 brawlers.)
---
Just means u got to get past 800 which is the new 500 right? Sounds to me that you arent as good as u say u are.
---
(Only 5 brawlers to 500, of course u support it) why wouldn't I? It benefits everyone except the petty. You talk of "pain" but you just want everyone to go through what u did, and you are acting like 500 on 5 brawlers (my favorites that I hardly played until this update) isnt a good achievement, but u say it is for others? Stfu.
---
I'm done talking to petty people like u on this subject if you wanna leave the game due to it please do because the people who started playing again due to the update vs the few petty pros/idiots there will be more people to fill in the spots.
---
1% of players does not beat 99% sorry but deal.
---
You can 1v1 any brawler with Mortis?  I find this extremely difficult to believe.
---
Im 3300 trophies btw
---
One of the thing is to get a rest from playing against another PROs. On the low trophies I don't know: braindead players or very small kids or their cats/dogs
---
Yeah I don’t think he knows what he’s talking about.
---
I put a Humor Flair already.. meaning I am clearly not serious about this lol 😂
---
E
---
Rip doge
---
I am honestly starting to think that it's some kind of meme.
---
Well actually Shelly with her Super is impossible.Darryl, Bull and El Primo can get really hard.
---
Ugh
---
Thicc brock
---
 Tara no U card
---
I’ve had worse in my 2 megaboxes
---
It depends if you know how to use that brawler :)
---
"Mr.Gat says hi"
---
That is Rosa her shield pre nerf
---
No other multiplauer game ranks people on individual characters. This is why. It's always been a problem, but now it's inescapable. Even playing 550-600+ brawlers, you get matched with people under 7k. I've seen people Q with a 700-800 brawler and get a random 6k who only pushes one or two brawlers. They almost always suck.
---
Oof. Bummer, dude. Better wait until brawl ball comes around.
---
Oh my god Tick, what happened to you?
---
OH BARLEY NO
---
Wait what
---
K
---
Good ending
---
She’s real flexible, yeah.
---
Just dont attack anyone without your super (unless youre willing to pay for the star power)
---
Its honestly too big of a difference without star power and with it.
---
I just got fertilize from 10k mega box. And yeah, I play solo :)
---
My 7 years old brother get legendary, 2 epics and Tara at 2300 trophies 2 months ago, and now, when I HAD UPED his account to 5k trophies, he opened his first Mega box, he not get legendary (0.03%) he was angry.
---
 I say him, that he should play ALL GAMEMODES TO GET TOCKENS FROM IT AND OPEN BIG BOX, because he didn't do it early, only play SD. I get my first legendary today, after 7 months of playing and can't understand this kids

But when you donate for skin, you ARE STAR on battlefield, but donaters don't highlight from f2p. Why Supercell don't make cool skin, which can be only be bought for gems, and cool skin, which can be bought only by star tockens and this skins MUSTN'T BE JUST RECOLORED SKIN?
---
I PLAY SINCE JUNE 2017 AND I HAVE 25/27 BRAWLERS WTF
---
This Is So True
---
Oh look, another lapdog that supercells needs. People like you make me sick. 500 was supposed to be symbol of accomplishment you dunderhead. Now they force you to play more to remain high up the leaderboard. What if those pro players are only earning from that game from being full time esports player. Play 16 hours a day to get on top? Brainless people like is what makes supercell happy
---
 **5.Repetitive/low effort posts will be removed.**

yep literally everyone has this skin. smartasses like me rather save the starpoints for better skins

Hes dumb.

It sucks

Yeah they are strong there, way stronger than rosa

It wasn't hard as much

So what is this picture even suppose to mean. I assumed the other person would get it when they saw it. But this is just the character select screen.   
---
Did you just gain a bunch of trophies? Well you should have just taken a video of you scrolling through you battle log to show all the wins.
---
a friend of mine had power 1 at rank 20 its just skill and teaming in showdown tbh
---
Use super
---
I was always taken by surprise. That line coming out of a child with *that* emotion
---
Saved by in game friends who can outplay even max players (Mecha Crow that saved that that Shiba Bruce)
---
Leon will get first, the last one would be spike
---
Lookin’ cool mate!
---
I played him today and it's fun.
---
I just saw the stupid title
---
exactly my thoughs... afterall getting 10k+ is **quite a grind** and I think trophy road could be better from my point of view. We will see...
---
Sorry not himself *itself.
---
yessss
---
And people like you is why the world is slowly getting fcked up. Only want to breeze through everything easily. Dont even want a challenge. I bet you are the type that falls and never wants to get up from the floor. Instead wants someone to sit you up on a wheelchair because there is no risk falling right? Fcking brainless shit. Congratulation, you are the world fastest runner. 1 month later, bionic legs can be used. Efforts meaningless. So what is your point, and btw. Pros are the reason why this game was growing quickly and increasing its fanbase to filth like you.

So do I!😂 Upvote this please⬆️

---
ok
---
My first rank 20 is Shelly
---
Really ? I took it from someone crediting the same user wth ?!
---
Lmao kid, stop karma farming.
---
Mortis should have a buff for a simple reason: he is a melee brawler but he can't fight against brawlers who aren't sharpshooters or throwers. He should deal more damage (example: 900 --&gt; 1100), have a little longer range and a shorter reload time (example: 2,4s --&gt; 2,0s)
---
Thats so sad
---
That spike better than real
---
*Gets Spike from the box*
---
Why are you still thinking about this?

Don't move the screen when posting replays. it is fucking annoying you child.

white el primo

Downvote if you like new brock more

I only meer crow, my legendary chance is once again the lowest it can be

It’s different because of Showdown’s power cubes...

I don't play at night that much, but must agree that it's a cool concept :D

You can go diagonally and hit that thing with your side. It’s hard to pull off though, I just lure it to my teamates :P

Can i make it in my yt channel?
---
....tick is no thrower.....cuz he SHOOTS bombs that explode in other Smaller bombs....Carl, Tara, Spike, Crow, dynamike and Barely are thrower cuz they all THROW stuff
---
It was a special offer at 349. Their actual price is 500 gems.
---
It would definitly help Orange Juice with opening his boxes xD
---
Same head,same energy
---
I see what you're saying. Maybe if after the gates will open, the only way to get more power cubes is to go to the battlefield and fight for them. But then, this way is too hard to recover your lost cubes.
---
Coming next - Brawl Stars Sudoku Fights looooool

How much money do you have?

You know what that means!

I don't have enough for my chicken nugget ;-;

its the only way to get legendaries, the other way is to be a noobie at 4k or less

כן נכון

If you left out the last two panels of would've been infinitely better

Its the only way to get ez legendarys and skins

👏👏👏

Man I could afford the black mecha Crow

I get free rewards at 11.00 too
---
you got to buy it now

LMAO
---
The black one is cooler but man I really want robo mike he will be 300 gems ;-;
---
El primo is very good in gem grab if you don't jump into the enemy team with 10 gems
---
Idiot people can play what they want. You wont tell them what to do. I reported you for being toxic, fucking crybaby
---
Do it
---
Only to press it again
---
I hate it lol
---
I’ve played in late beta, and I’m still doing that. But I play 10 minutes every day usually
---
So this is why sometimes have mortis on heist as teammate
---
Video coming in max 10 minutes dont worry
---
Have u bought,it yet?
---
Lol 😅
---
The new star power is so her turret shoots energy orbs

*1/20 chance*
---
Nice montage
---
Idea was very cool
---
I just afraid the random don’t know how to play
---
Ay i feel you bro literally 800 is the new rank 20
---
Well that's why you don't have starpiwers
---
I think this game mode will be a bit too complicated for kids who play the game, other than that really good idea!
---
Why there is a joker's fan art in r/BrawlStars?
---
Ok cool
---
Good one

I bought the crow one, having great fun with it. Definitely buy it!

1% is 0,01.
---
Precentage of this happening 3 times in a row is:
---
(0,01*0,01*0,01)*100=0,000001*100=0,0001% 
---
0,0001% means that chance of this happening is one in a million.
---
Because you listen to Billie eiyelash
---
Tilts about 500 trophies in 1 night
---
Smart throwers can throw their attacks to the front of themselves, just, nowadays so many people auto-aim when a Mortis comes close, that’s sad.
---
i never said he was a god tier, I said he was a top tier, top players will always choose god tier brawlers,
---
sorry if i didn't made it clear that a top tier is not the best one, i just remembered some chart here a time ago, talking about god,top,good, bad tier
---
What star power glitch?
---
I don’t see the problem
---
I’m sure that ur under 3k
---
No because reducing attack damage by a percentage and just adding health had a different effect
---
Give me this pack
---
Are you blind?
---
Sadly they won’t remove it because moderation here is so terrible

for 22pounds u get 4 mega boxes, spike, a skin and one gem! That's a great price!

That was exactly their point actually, they said that in  their patch notes with the big update
---
Lol when i was 2000 i had 19 brawlers lol
---
Now i need only 3 brawlers 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I did that the other day by accident and felt like a complete jackass.
---
The bigger question is why tara be going along with it .-.
---
Hmmmmmm
---
Fucking crybaby? Use a more hateful word dumbass, like little bitch. God ur not even good at being toxic retard
---
My name is piper is hot
---
Haha ja
---
Congrats on unlocking another rare brawler
---
1% is 0,01
---
It means that chance of this happening 3 times in a row is:
---
(0,01×0,01×0,01)×100=0,000001×100=0,0001%
---
It means that chance of pulling 3 star powers in a row is one in a million.
---
Let's play a game
---
Fuck off
---
My mom is transphobic. She might be homophobic too, but I'm not sure.
---
You right
---
PTSD TRIGGERED oh god....the shellies....the bulls....the bos.....
---
Also your url is 👌
---
I did what i saidi would so its allowed that way
---
Not today supercell
---
 Bull wasted super  pam going  at on oss when primo is coming  and rosa just rush like the 10 gem primo joke
---
Oh I didn’t actually watch the full video I just looked at the trophies
---
Lol
---
I'm just a kid who plays brawl and likes drawing
---
And on start : 8 items? Ok 3 new brawlers. And on end : 3 starpowers, why?
---
Of course, nice comic
---
God tier is: "S" and top tier is: "A"
---
God dangit another one, when will it end D:&lt;
---
The people : WE JUST PRETEND WE DID NOT SEE IT
---
I have to be honest i don't remember that
---
Girls don't exist
---
*Insert thanos.impossible.jpg here*
---
How😂
---
Go onto my posts some 75 trophy guy got in a my match for 700
---
I DON'T KNKW BUT HER FACE
---
 
---
Thank you.
---
u/uwutranslator
---
:D
---
ueaaah
---
Did you do it?
---
You could call it disorientation
---
this offer is very nice, only 100 pln ;)))
---
Not yet
---
Gonna do it in a few hours
---
I’m out rn with some friends so I can’t really do anything
---
Agreed, not willing to waste my gems as a F2P lol
---
Yeah mortis can dodge with his shots on mike and tick, but barley is bound to hit him once or twice, and I prefer 3v3 modes to showdown, so they have teammates that can easily finish you off. The only real counter play to throwers is throwers in the 3v3 modes, if you are playing showdown thr mortis argument is true, not in 3v3 though.
---
Unless there is no other way should be replaced with: Unless you will backstab immediately
---
Gotta make sure them sinks are draining.
---
Ok i will, give me one or two days.
---
I would buy crow
---
Wallet: Am I A joke to you?
---
oh no
---
n o t a g a i n
---
No, it's okay! It's still good
---
what in tarnation is a floris?
---
Summer
---
100 up votes for me because i purchased it and got nothing except coins and gems
---
499 gems  and many mega boxs
---
Just increases your render distance lol
---
*splish splash your opinion is trash*
---
Next one is gonna be the draw 4 wild: Tara gets an energy drink and four colts come out of the bushes and shoot ya.
---
This also works on Frank, and as a Mortis gang member, I shall smite you from the Earth with my shovel for accusing me and my fellow mates of teaming lol
---
You do realize he called himself that right?
---
#YAAHHH IT'S REWIND TIME
---
me with only spike
---
Thank god i dont have these ppl on my band
---
Gosh, do more, I love this style
---
Sadly no, maxed all except the three legendarys I can't get...
---
I got zero so keep grinding boss
---
I'm luckier, I only need Spike and Crow and haven't gotten a brawler since the day after Bibi so my chances are quite high.
---
How many boxes did this take? Lol
---
FLY, LIKE AN EAGLE
---
Free2Play
---
Mortis is so sexy that even Tara couldn't rezist him
---
Gg! What mode was it?
---
All but all three legendarys and Bibi... Can't pull any of them. My chance is above mythic too
---
Cool good luck
---
*Sad music plays*
---
Can I use this for a video I will credit you
---
Why does Leon look like a girl
---
Now Jessie is the FBI
---
How you choose the leon icon?
---
I've been playing since the day it realised and I'm still missing four brawlers, but points with gold in the shop to speed it up
---
It's cool :)
---
.......... You do know my story revolves around a small cast of characters.......
---
Hmm, makes sense
---
Dummkopfs!
---
It’s cool but a bit too complicated. Some people forget that small children make up a majority if thus games players
---
Got 19 at 9k :D

Thanks, but I gave up the day I got Bibi. Hadn't any new brawler for like six months then got *that *
---
Especially Rockabilly Mortis.
---
my wallet is safe dont worry
---
r/undertail
---
Thank you, I'll improve on the next.
---
Wowzers! Wish I could draw like that haha nice job!
---
This belongs to r/BrawlStarsP
---
nita is too adorable for not tolerating 🤣
---
omG UR sO gOoD
---
Genius.
---
sooo thats why tara got remodeled?
---
If n is the number of boxes, x the number of star powers gained, and p the probability of receiving a star power, the probability of receiving 3 star powers from a mega box (not considering the other rewards) is:  
---
n = 10 (1 mega box = 10 boxes)
---
x = 3
---
p = 0.01 (1% of receiving a star power from a box)
---
  
---
p^(x)(1 - p)^(n - x)  
---
0.01^(3)(1 - 0.01)^(7)
---
The odds of this happening is 9.3206534790699 × 10^(-7), or 0.00000093206534790699
---
I didn’t play at the time, but I think everyone slowly takes damage and you only heal by killing others
---
Just buy it geez...
---
 Hi, can I use this clip for one of my funny moments and epic moments and fails videos? I will give you credit. This is my YT: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJyrNfNgjwN\_B6IWAZqbWzg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJyrNfNgjwN_B6IWAZqbWzg)
---
Yes but he gets way too much flack for not being a pro player. He isn't even bad
---
I'm not the one uploading the videos, I just do the vids for them. I think I used your clip, be patient :)
---
Woahhh this is cool! Where'd you find this?
---
Pipers needs a name and description change
---
lol
---
Buy 80gem mega box instead
---
I am saving them 👍
---
Yes, just to allow comments like yours to continue to exist
---
Hell YEAH
---
My mind's tellin' me no, but my body, my body's tellin' me yes 
---
i really tired of this sh\*t lıars
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
edit:srry i said sh\*t that is a bad word plz forgive me
---
I just got mortis today and got him to 200 trophies with power 1 So do I have skill
---
Huh, I was wrong. Mecha Crow and Robo Spike are bought with gems, meaning my initial comment was correct.
---
Lol ty si asi Čech :D
---
Nope I better get legends from boxes
---
Lol it happens to me like every day, I usually just spin now
---
same
---
And the shellys with band aid and super
---
I loved the pam one and this one is just as epic
---
I mean you were playing Frank on heist, that's not much better lol
---
It’s a percentage decrease not an amount decrease
---
PLN, so you have to divide it by 4 to get $
---
Bro he has 168k not the best yt
---
I know the source. Not telling.
---
Ah of course, matchmaking is drunk again
---
I’m 4th barley in mine I got 602
---
Jj
---
Lol, love doing this
---
Can't wait to upgrade my brawlers with those 50 coins...
---
It's not like we get much more from key boxes
---
I think the same 🤣
---
I got him today and I love going that to darryls
---
Imma do that last let me do the other brawlers first
---
Thank you, please send me the link when you do :)
---
Es un buen punto de vista
---
replay¿
---
I finally got Bibi
---
ayo wassup my name is mortis and I am a monster in disguise, wait a second who are those guys? frank is my son and they thought I say lies.
---
(Lol I know it cringe I can't rap 🙄)
---
Yeah but it still makes me mad
---
No
---
Well barley was on a team with someone
---
I have to problems with it
---
Winning, because they paid, the clue is in your own title
---
Wow this is really cool!
---
Yea,most probably
---
Cobi
---
And then your potato router has the game 
---
 say, 'You disconnected for idling!' and you've been in the game for a second
---
Lol I did same when he asked me he’s done it twice
---
Thanks 👍
---
For me if getting the map in is the prize
---
Omg the enemy bull even stopped her from making you lose but failed wtf 🤣
---
Island invasion is better
---
Six throwers, two Crows, and two people who need help
---
R6 siege stole brawl stars main idea, let’s return the favor
---
You know it's fun, right?
---
Very good drawing!
---
Yes it looks like him but I’m not sure if it’s him I can give the link if you want
---
#F
---
YOU SPENT SUCH A FOUL EXISTENCE, THE SENTENCE IS DEATH!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
OH NU
---
Thanks!
---
What?
---
Bo best mom
---
Well whatever color it is I don’t really like it
---
Oh sorry if I was acting like a jerk.
---
People mostly are not able to understand my jokes so...
---
Mortis reap life essence of Brawler he defeat and he get a additional healt too **yaaaa**
---
Rip 30$ :p
---
You cant say same about health care system tho  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Same problem
---
Wow nice
---
r/brawlrecruit

U've never played tuber simulator?

Wait.. thats illegal
---
Its an idea
---
Rico is real Nice ay cavern churn
---
Yep
---
Someone say to me. WHAT IT MEAN?!
---
#Mate if I see another rank 20 brawler post imma flip I have 14 of them dude that ain’t spec
---
Sure
---
Cavern Churn and Feast or Famine and Erratic Blocks and Eye of the Storm and LITERALLY EVERY MAP IN EXISTENCE. SNAKE PRAIRIE OH MY GOOOOOOODODOODDOODODJSKDBSNWBSN
---
Go to the desktop site and set your flair for this subreddit.
---
Cool dude. I'm a colloid btw
---
What is it?
---
Im at 9k and no legendary i dont jave leon either so thats why those offers are there
---
That really doesn't do that much work there is probably a few times that you hit someone with super but don't kill them
---
Nope
---
Ah shit,here we go again
---
how long have you been playing? did you buy anything using your free gems? how much trophies do you have?
---
What 6969 mean?
---
meme_generator.exe.startedworking
---
OoOoHH NEw CusTomERs🍺🍸🍹🍻
---
What? This post makes literally no sense and i would honestly love to know how automod even let this stay on the subreddit.
---
Shelly’s feast
---
MAYBE he does not have 400 trophies
---
Most likely a virus link
---
Thank u now I cannot sleep
---
Yep. Just dont ask for Super meal or she ll drive all the customers away.
---
Enters old siege
---
So they start at 0 gems.
---
Why the fuck is this flared as humor? It doesnt even have anything on it except for an offer that literally anyone can see when they log onto the game smfh
---
Oh no ;-;
---
Sure man of course
---
You need less skill to hit people with your super than the skill you need to master dyna jump.
---
You can also do something like 23% to the heist safe with just dyna super and all 3 attacks
---
I respect your opinion, i actually like it tho
---
That’s fine. I respect your opinion too.
---
Wow.. I can't believe you replied so quickly 👍
---
Ita gang qua eh? Poi quell'offerta dovrebbe essere un bug che gira sulli account con pochi trofei, e io ne ho circa 3200 (ita gang here? That offer should be a bug that is found on the accounts with low trophies, and i have around 3200)
---
This happened to me today with Poco in Showdown.
---
Believe or fucking not, I got first place.
---
Good artist or not, I really love the facial expressions!!!
---
yes
---
so true...
---
With poco same problem. POCO SUPPORT. GET IT PLS! STOP BE NOOBS AND STOP HATING POCO AND MORTIS. THEY ARE GREAT!
---
I was matchmaked once against a 700 trophies Leon with a rank 17 Shelly
---
Bull’s star powers are literally just the elder scrolls “are you looking to protect yourself, or deal some damage”
---
Probably because if you were able to do that you could dash really far through a lake
---
Aha nevadi :D
---
Btw i updated it and make more equal for bralwers. https://crux.page.link/hPuE
---
.... so... uh sorry I was slacking off on my job... so uh What are we dealing with here fellow Poco
---
Thanks :)
---
I'll try bibi. Give me two or three days.
---
No spike is not op, trust me
---
r/foundamobileuser
---
It’s cuz of that 666 in ur trophy count
---
essentially
---
6969?
---
It is the only way that a dynamike can run away
---
Crow should have gotten a better voice
---
What
---
Imagine her getting a new voice act:
---
1, 2, 3 you're all going to flee from me!
---
I your required trophy to join is 0+ and its open then your club will be bombarded with these fake websites
---
I don’t know what you mean? Storming Area 51 is fresh lol.
---
I am not ready for all these bulls and shellys
---
I agree
---
Bruh he looks straight out of fnaf
---
Minding their own bussines ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
wow impressive, you must grind a lot? what game mode did you push those brawlers?
---
QUE tal lançar uma skin nova para a bibi, a bibi jogadora de tênis
---
bruh 😎😤😤🙌😂
---
It's not really s m e x y if you buy him
---
Just checked ... so hypocritical
---
I used a secret trick to unlock Leon. Wanna know how? It's called a credit card.
---
Agree
---
I did it!

Then why did YOU

why do you assume what gender it is?
---
level 35 pack is honestly god-tier, until the summer pack arrived
---
Losing streak of -3 trophies dude... If it exists it doesnt mean you are bad, it means that it's hard to have 500 trophies. Anyway I know Crow is hard to push (bc of the meta) but anyway winning more trophies doesnt make you better. So now, a 500 tr crow means nothing. Now 500 tr is basic and does not mean you are strong with a brawler because even if you have 0.5 ratio, you win 3 trophies from 400-500... Before it was 0, it's so much easier. I spent a lot of time grinding my brawlers to 500, now it sucks.... I have to repush them all to finally have a correct elo. It's simply boring...
---
Btw 27 brawlers at 1000 trophies = 27 000 trophies ?! You need 25 brawlers at 500 tr to be at 10k... It's easy now.
---
Anyway sorry for the misunderstanding, I understand that it's not that "easy" to grind, but way less harder than before.
---
That’s a lot of money
---
I also think his star power should have made the person poisoned slower
---
Poco in heist
---
Bruh this ain't in a nutshell it's the real deal
---
It was pretty easy when you have the right strategy that I had to find for myself. I grinded about two and half an hour
---
I loved it
---
Wow, another 13 years old kids joke
---
the spin at the end looked more like a seizure
---
What the fuck Carl?!
---
Riddle me this HOW WOULD POCO PLAY A SURFBOARD
---
I just wish franks 2nd star power is a rejuvenated health tick after a kill instead of 1000 more health? Like what is that going to do with frank?
---
Tru
---
its still hard to earn star points, and i only used crow as an example, still took other 5 days to push darryl and poco to 500 if you need more info. and yeah misunderstandings happen
---
Maybe he can shoot a spiritual dragon that can go through multiple people and break walls
---
Not really.
---
They also think that too.
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
Bruh so the euro worth more so they have to pay more?
---
bruh 👏🤣🤣🔥🔥
---
Like the old poison in clash royale? Maybe in the future if they add more star powers that could be crows star power, slow affect added to his attack
---
She’s literally the best brawler in the game right now...
---
damn
---
Yay! She's my current main and I really like her, so thanks for doing her!
---
I got mortis my first mythic at 8k.
---
Yeah that works
---
Nice job!
---
Rosa is  in diet
---
Why did they remove that again?
---
repost. was top post on r/brawlstars 2 ish months ago, titled 'brawlstars in one picture'
---
Those aren’t shitty brawler, but maybe your skill is shitty
---
Crow gang btw
---
Well they want their beta player to play so they make them play less.
---
Magic
---
Don’t mess with my crew
---
Lmao 😂 take my upvote
---
sometimes it never notifies me
---
so, I dont know but u right jessie is a child.
---
Look, all I’m saying is that the barleys and dynamikes have to enter eventually
---
It's pretty disturbing
---
I am 8k all big boxes no brawler or star power
---
It’s a forced meme to charge people up to the idea of rushing ICE centers, right?
---
El Primo needs a merf
---
It’s a hat and it’s on top of her head, I’ll allow it
---
R.I.P headphone users. (at the end, you scared me)
---
Would you rather spend 50 bucks or 30.
---
Maybe ur jokes are c
---
go to r/brawlrecruit
---
Thats just a showdown 1st place reward
---
Comes with a awesome skin.
---
r/cursedimagines
---
I did not know Spike was a male...
---
You should go, make your birthday your last!
---
Area 51 can and will not hesitate to kill all of them if they insist on raiding so I mean it's just suicide with extra steps if you ask me
---
high probability
---
For some reason that skin comes in 3 different colors
---
Good one.
---
good job
---
thanks! :)
---
Guys, i just buyed this Crow, Spike and random mythic. Thanks!!!!! I got 2 legendaries, and mortis in one day!
---
it was the first poco star power
---
By the time I read the post it was 20980
---
*stonks*
---
Huh-ah
---
"Yeah Im A hAcKeR"
---
Honestly the Gene super buff was one of the most balanced buffs the game has had so far
---
Thanks
---
I just got 2 level 70 but I liked being in level 69
---
WHAAT!?
---
ThAt Is NoT sAnTa
---
Keep in mind he has the longest range in the game so there should be no reason for you to be close to people. Hide behind the walls and throw the mines in areas that people want to go to. Area denial.  Use his super as self defense as that is it's main purpose. If he gets to close to someone then the player needs to learn positioning and if he gets jumped then he can always use his super.
---
Huh I read one from 14h saying 370k-400k
---
Lvl 2 Dynamike with 500 trophies? I'm sure your left thumb is tired🔄
---
Now everyone knows.
---
Am.. So, who is It?
---
They’re most likely in the same club. The 600 Rosa is trying to boost his teammates, unbeknownst to him, the matchmaking pairs them with the highest trophy level in the party.
---
Hey, I remember that last panel
---
Now that’s a lotta damage
---
Oh wait, there isnt bull
---
The infinity stones
---
Duo showdown spawns i assume.
---
lol op’s just flexing that he has friends
---
*dies inside*
---
Could be a second account
---
You’re missing the point. The format is stupid and  nonsensical. A funny post using that format doesnt make the format better.
---
they used to be the shit. then mobile developers rose up
---
Only a few....thousand.
---
Pretty much
---
Thanks now i can't sleep......
---
I got Shelly level 10 but IDC I want to get my gems back
---
O seu nome e agemonzinho
---
The format being stupid and nonsensical is also pretty subjective. 
---
Unless you can point out a reason that it makes no sense and it sucks that is purely objective and not opinionated. 
---
I think the format makes plenty of sense. You might not enjoy it, but that’s even more subjective.
---
Bruh or bra😂😂
---
Looks great :)
---
Some time ago the game shows the skins on the skin wheel.
---
oH mY gOd I nEvEr KnEw
---
Welcome to a great game :)

i got 72

Clasher with the fade away to win the game!!!!
---
old mike and old brock are better than they are now; they fit the style of the brawler better
---
Me..
---
Toon boom
---
Nah
---
Extra complicated = extra fun
---
I oppened 5 today and got NO star power. It's getting retarded!

Is this a joke? He def does not need a buff especially in this meta rn
---
Asia is wrong
---
I have more than 6000 trophies and have 0 legandaries
---
Good point
---
We already have that. It’s called snake prairie/Cavern Churn
---
Yes, me too
---
Hope u like the game
---
 I believe that there should be a way to deal with that, it's ruining the game...
---
Seems unnecessary
---
Why is this a remodel??
---
Why do people commit suicide just get a better life lmao
---
I’m 18 and I played since beta too
---
Started last Christmas and only need spike. Sadly I did also buy crow but only because of the skin and him being so many gems on there own. And the summer pack. It was a deal I couldn't pass.
---
"Gems"
---
Hahah funny get it because dynamike teams hahah
---
I too am proud
---
pocahontas. Also I can see your deleated posts famm.
---
I see your hunting for karma.
---
If ur luck is not garbage and u really want it then yes
---
oh hell nah
---
pocahontas
---
Silly me
---
Oh hell YEAH
---
LUCKY!!!!
---
Nah you just have to add gems on the trophy road and buff the amount of coins given. Simple as that.
---
These types of posts are the worst. They offer no conversation at all. No point to telling us this.
---
REEEEEEEEEPOOOOOOOOOST
---
its not his fault look since the rankings in the game is bs he was put with some rank 20
---
You should spend them on pocahontas
---
Wat
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPOST
---
Saying you expect downvoted will not make people not downvote you.
---
*I am ridicously amazing*
---
I know, I'm mainly talking about shelly with her super though.
---
I thought this is a plush...
---
I need a mecha crow plush
---
How about now?
