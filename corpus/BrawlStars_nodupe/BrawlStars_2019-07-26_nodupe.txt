Im so pissed that YOUR meme made meme review 18 but whatever
---
Piper js actually good in some brawl ball maps
---
Bruh, bruh
---
She looks way too masculine
---
Praise the church of water sheep
---
She looks way to masculine, but it looks sick
---
Very nice. Literally how I play bull
---
I mean.. she‚Äôs a tomboy, but thanks!
---
Nice! It was an accurate meme.
---
Piper is useable on maybe one map. And even when shes useable theres always a better option. If you want long range and high damage go for brock colt or rico. She has a poor ability to stop goals and her low hp combined with poor damage in close quarters situations, which is most of brawlball makes her much less viable.
---
Where's white crow and crow
---
[removed]
---
From me they're GX, i suffer because they're the same
---
Nice
---
No
---
I kind of love this idea, but I also think it may increase camping somewhat since kill-stealing would now be much more beneficial.
---

---
It'd definitely help with teaming though.
---
Man it wasn‚Äôt my purpose to come across as a ‚Äúskilled-player‚Äù, just wanna show this video in which two teamers get killed, really I don‚Äôt care in which way that happens, teaming must stop.
---
That wasn‚Äôt half bad honestly
---
Yes, please!

So basically civil war melee edition

I didn't understand the joke and was like "why is El Primo covered in sprinkles" unless I read this comment

But they don't have to ruin others experiences by doing so

The club was created based off teaming. It's how they're always top

Bro and I thought I was the only one with this issue
---
Band-aid Shelly is the most OP brawler. Also trophy balance changes made it too easy so it's not that impressive.
---
Idk if dis a hate comment but people really wanted the Leon when it came out.
---
I think throwers are getting a bad rep, so I support this.
---
Whichever will it be
---
It‚Äôs from an old update.

My 12k box was similar trash lol, I‚Äôm missing tara and all legendaries.... didn‚Äôt even get a star power when I have 7 available to unlock

Including Ash from YouTube,

How in the world you did this!?!?!??
---
I am saying that the new brawler will be better than Leon
---
Art thief but that user name GEDi-KOR instead of GEDI-KOR is just clever
---
nice, but some of the star powers are imbalanced. For ex rico, tara, crow and some others. barley's star power is just stolen from the very first spike's. However, nice

Whats the BG?

the worst is that the account is from a friend of mine who started playing recently

Did you try turning it off and back on again?

It is ok

idk why, I've just started laughing after reading your reply
---
I just saved up enough to get Poco's star power. Then BOOM his second star power releases a few days later. That 2k was so bittersweet because I didnt realize how truly minuscule 500 health to a dumbass random is compared to healing any teammates in my range and damaging enemies for 1.2k is.
---
it‚Äôs neo
---
No wonder he hit that button. He was awfully drunk!
---
(Also nice work!)
---
the fact that they fell for it multiple times in a row lol
---
enemies: can we play hei-
---
tara: no
---
Not liking your comment is also a opinion
---
Actually some really neat ideas, but Poco's would literally make Gem Grab a living ***hell****.* Some of the other ones may need a *bit* toned down, like Rico's and Bibi's, but overall not too bad concepts.
---
You say it increases his mobility but you never go under 1 ammo so you never actually use the star power...
---
Its basically bulls super... Just less range...
---
Ohhh nah! I was just busy with personal stuff.

Rule is 5 people on one team and 5 on the other they fight to capture the points which will be bigger and first to hit a certain amount of points are deemed the winners any other name recommendations for this new mode are welcomed!
---
New game mode! 1_ "Capture the flag" between the 2 teams (Blue vs. Red) would have to steal the flag and take it to its base. Each flag captured and taken to its base would be 1 point. The maximum points to win the game would be 3 or 2 (depends on Super Cell) 2_ "Labyrinth" there will be a maze where the 2 teams (Blue vs. Red) would have to reach the center of the maze. On the way there would be robots that prevented them from reaching the center. When they reach the center, the two teams will fight each other. The team that finishes without members will lose and the other will win the game, could be "resurrected" after 15 seconds if a member is alive. 3_ "Annihilating Robots" the blue team against the red team would have to destroy the robots. The team that destroyed the most robots would win the game in case of a draw. A large "Boss" robot will appear and the team that destroys it faster would be the winner (Optional)

I was pre global and 10k was a big thing back then especially because only 21 brawlers (15 in true beta) and 500 pushing wasn't a joke (back then a 3v3 win above 400 would give +2, showdown win +5 in true beta) and pre global in 2018 it was the same as now but only 21 brawlers. I think I was 7k July last year now I 14.6k
---

That would be the equivalent of buying skins with gold

What I want to know is how u have 26/27 as a global player

Damn 500 lvl 1 used to be good (I got 500 lvl 1 penny before trophy changes) but now 821 lvl 1 is pretty impressive although it's easy to get carried in duo

Exactly, also side note, I live white crow because I like to be unique and nobody ever wears him

that‚Äôs the point sergeant

I love white crow because he used to be the symbol of superiority in the beta days before phoenix crow was released

Lwarb super brawlers infinite supers  against bots am I right

There you go an Upvote

You should just save up your Gems and not buy any more token doubles or tickets.  Just save them up for when a brawler Deal or offer comes up for the one you are missing you can get it.

Me looking at how many brawlers he has instead of caring about the gold. Still has two legendaries. \*Cries inside\*

Haha. I knew it. I wanted to be wooooshed. NOBODY EVER REPLIES TO ME! I SEE THIS AS AN ABSOLUTE WINNNNNN
---
That's not even that beta
---
they were abusing a glitch, thats why hes in the club called fix your game. remember this was before the trophy system revamp so essentially u gain like 2 trophies per win at 900+
---
I buy skins with gems, how many total gems have you gotten so far from when u started? Because even 24 or 25 is insanely lucky for a global player
---
both. mainly randoms
---
400k trophies lol this person surely have all the 100 brawlers from future updates but he ignored them so he only loves to play with shelly XD

I don't really keep track but 200+ I think.  I mostly buy token doublers so that way I get more boxes and a chance to get more gems.

---
THIS. Just passed 14k this season and I‚Äôd say I push with randoms around 95% of the time. When you play in teams you‚Äôre much more likely to play another 3 stack team which makes your games a lot more difficult. I‚Äôm fine with teammates a couple thousand trophies below me as long as the enemy team has less trophies too (and this happens the vast majority of the time).

Sorry we don't speak cyka blyat
---
I used to team in Showdown but no one teams with Shelly so I destroy them by myself lol
---
Well you see No. people are lucky enough that they got it after global release. The skin is for those who stuck with brawl stars for 1.5 years at the time through the thick and thin through portrait and landscape. The community was upset when we found out that global players were also getting it. We wanted something only for the beta players of the game. So if u take away the only thing which even resembles being a beta player... everyone is gonna get sh*tty with ya.
---
TL;DR NO!
---
Lol i‚Äô ve seen brock‚Äôs skin yesterday in the shop
---
How much?
---
Judging by the comments here, only a handful of people in this comment section seem to realize that.

Yeah, as a dyna player hes more annoying than he is op to throwers.

He should play brawl stars
---
Not game breaking
---
Well what you ‚Äúbelive‚Äù is different from fact bud.
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt he have a faster reload speed? He‚Äôs based off of chip damage, if he attacked slow then he would do (as it was in the past) next to no damage per second, and be shit (as it was in the past). 
---
Fast brawler speed is a perk, he needs to be quick to follow enemies to be able to do consistent damage
---
Smaller hurtbox is literally hardly noticeable as it‚Äôs not even by a significant factor, that‚Äôs just an excuse.
---
Seeing as you have all the brawlers *but* legendaries why do you think you can gauge the effectiveness of a legendary brawler- Crow? 
---
You‚Äôve never ever played him against people (don‚Äôt throw that test against bots bs at me, not the same) so how is your opinion even supported?
---
It‚Äôs like saying a food is disgusting without even trying it.
---
I‚Äôm f2p as well, only having a single SP, and no offense, but 8k back then was pretty low and it definitely is now, sorry.

I‚Äôm very confused on the teaming thing. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just me but I‚Äôve never ran into more than 4 people teaming on this map. Is it just me or do I not have enough trophies to experience this? (400-600 trophy range)

why do you care about pointlessly downvoting someone? downvotes are just votes that take off a little karma they're not votes that choose who's gonna be president they're just internet votes that don't do nothing

They really should have done something solely for beta players. I‚Äôm not beta, but I preregistered and started the day it went global. I‚Äôm glad I got star Shelly, but beta really should have gotten something unique.

Starpowers is just stat increase? Do something better, I know you can
---
I hate you
---
Yes the rest will go to waste. So don‚Äôt open boxes really early when the shop resets. Maybe just wait for a shop to reset and have the brawler at a different coin value if you don‚Äôt want to waste any coins.

What glitch

But the art wasn't creditted, qnd even the muwic is very unfitting. I'm assuming this is one of your favorite songs?

She‚Äôs one of the best snake prairie brawlers.  Better than Bull at least.

Yeah maybe you‚Äôre right, but even a still image rainbow skin would look awesome!
---
Brock animation
---
Just why?
---
I think it means original post(er)
---
Piper's boyfriend?
---
Plus there may be box which can be bought with star point
---
I ain‚Äôt mad, just want to show people that some of these top players aren‚Äôt getting to where they are because they are good but because they are using pretty unfair tactics. Teaming in solo showdown is one thing but teaming in duos is pretty unreasonable imo. Not trying to bully anyone.

Why microphone dyna doesn't sing

I'm not supposed to give my opinion, but give it a try, and THEN you can tell me if it's good or not
---
You should choose the 150 gem one. The one on the left has a sacred number.
---
here is an idea, don't buy newer skins. supercell has started giving old skins on huge discounts. dragon jessie was offered in just 59 gems. loaded rico in 69. i think ome of dyna  ones was also in offer.
---
Last time I checked Toby doesn‚Äôt sue

My first bringer of doom

he understands that, and he‚Äôs saying it wouldn‚Äôt make sense to name his skin that since the chameleon pun is already tied to his base character

I said say *"Hit-or-Miss"* will make people think you're referencing Tik Tok, also piper and brock are exactly that. Single shot weapons that are hard to hit and rewarding if you do.

Dont get close to her
---
back in my day
---
Yeah I know it. But I would rather wait. In addition, It's not because the high rank  player are too rare for the system to make a match. If so, you will not encounter the case 16k(you)+6k+6k vs 10k+10k+10k. Pro players are definitely enough for  the system. In fact, if you are 6k players, you will still be teamed with 4k players, even thought there are many 6k players.

Is it one user = one frame only??

Damn i want leon

I don't think so. In the most matches I encountered, the noobs and pros are usually randomly teamed by the system. They are not friends playing together.

Way!!!
---
For me, yes, definitely. I recommend getting them.
---
Actually it's too super rare for your and my eyes
---
Or every single brawler in the fucking match is less than 10 trophies away from 400
---
Not  exactly. To come at that point i had to use all brawler i have and push them at least to 400, no matter if i hate playing with them. And to get to 12k, i would have to have all my brawlers at 523 average trophies, that isn't so easy after all, considering that i hate showdown so i have to worry about randoms.
---
Yup, that's all this is, all the new star powers are more op, ryan said that was the intention

Do the 300gem skins also get discounts? &amp; how much if so
---
U have a point
---
I get them when I get a new brawler and want to push them without their low power level from hindering me. Gets power 1 to power 5 instantly and would definitely recommend

Wait if I make a mistake am I then also a mistake?

Love it!!

Actually no. Supercell releases a new brawler every month but July, because the Devs are taking a break. They take a break every July. There are 12 months so the Devs release 11 brawlers per year. Right now is July, and we have 27 brawler, and there are 5 months left in the year. 27+5=32. 32+11=43. Then it would be 2021. 43+2=45. The Devs release the brawler at the end of the month, so we should have 45 brawlers by the end of February 2021. Please don't woooosh me, this comment took time to write.
