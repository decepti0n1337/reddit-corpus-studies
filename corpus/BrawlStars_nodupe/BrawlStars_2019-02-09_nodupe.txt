More than 7 times for me
---
---
---
Not another Bull/Primo meta map
---
I have a solid bet he‚Äôs being released at the start of next season, as most brawlers are, so everyone has a good shot at pushing him in trophies or the season.
---
I think I'm having a mental breakdown
---
He is a badass
---
yeh it was changed in recent update i think it looks great
---
Needs more Kevin Costner... ü§î
---
Ninja Leon would be more applicable than Tara. They all look cool either way. Nice job
---
I wish there was a "NEVER PLAY THESE BRAWLERS IN THIS GAME MODE" section so that he could throw barley in for Ball Brawl. He is so incredibly useless in that mode. 
---
Bank Robber Dynamike throws is bag of coins as the ultimate kapow!  
---
Bank Robber Pam has a coin turret that gives you coins per second (instead of healing you) hehe
---
I‚Äôve really been hoping for this. I hate always being competitive 
---
Don‚Äôt do it guys
---
You‚Äôll decrease my chances of winning
---
It yells.
---

---
A LOT.
---
No. Gems are good
---
14 or 15 of Feb
---
Ninja Tara would be so dope. I play Tara often and I really want to have a skin for her.
---
Yeah,I used the screen recording of ios. I didnt recorded to this pointü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
[Nope](https://imgur.com/gallery/ee3WwIQ) 
---
That would be fun to draw!  As much as I love Piper as Peach, Piper as Bayonetta would be really cool. 
---
so still, your salty, if your that good with colt you would know how to check bushes
---
Jessie: bRoKeN bEyOnD rEpAiR
---
Guy with star power wins. Go figure
---
It‚Äôs not that he does damage at long range. It‚Äôs that he can charge his super from that far, and that super is what will let him sneak up and get the kill.
---
Yeah I've been wondering this too... I guess it's because EU taxes are higher? But anyway SC is a Finish company, they could have been more comprehensive with their own continent...
---
This Oni Frank is insane
---
Bro , I wasn‚Äôt even talking about Bull just look at the question or are too blind (no offense) I asked - does Shelly need a nerf to her super and reload speedü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
All of these are really cool 
---
Brock got nerfed
---
What‚Äôs pb?
---
woo take tHE L
---
Because every once in a while all brawlers go for an all out peanut butter raid at jiffy headquarters
---
was this accidental, or purposful?
---
Which mall is this?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Not gonna lie about the last part tho
---
Too many...
---
just a typical day at the office 
---
guys hes purple cuz hes the gem carrier 
---
it's cool I want to be a character in the game he looks cool
---
Lol. Keep 'em coming!
---
Yeah isn't that what I said in my comment above?
---
What exploit
---
It‚Äôs from Peru, it is called  ‚ÄúPlaza Norte‚Äù ,in english: ‚ÄúNorth Plaza‚Äù :)
---
Wow you must feel great DESTROYING those bots huh?
---
haha good luck! :)
---
No, she decidedly looks weird from that angle
---
Nice
---
why u gotta make him sad tho :(
---
Holy crap
---
TBH right I never draw that's why
---
Yes I do experience that but it‚Äôs either lag or they have an angle (or brawlers like frank and Nita can shoot behind the wall a little) but yeah that‚Äôs why Nita is good and frank is flat out nnoying unless I‚Äôm running someone like colt
---
In duos it‚Äôs really fun actually cause you can farm them with good dps characters.
---
The luck system can really screw you over lol
---
Some shots can cut corners if you arent fully behind a wall. You might just be experiencing high latency. 
---
430 now! :)
---
Yep
---
*It is disconnected for 2 seconds when is in game*
---
Well if you never draw, than that‚Äôs actually pretty good then. I just assumed you already were drawing a lot of stuff before that.
---
r/engrish
---
Eyy, you clipped me!
---
What‚Äôs the error?
---
I know right 
---
Best skin concept I've seen so far
---
This would be great for next year‚Äôs lunar new year 
---
Oh and yes Colt! I always survive a Colt and then a second later after all bullets are gone you suddenly die.
---
Colt has some crazy lag thing going on in my experience.
---
When I play him myself too. 
---
I'm on 200mbps wifi with below 20ms ping I guess. But idk about the servers of brawl stars that I connect to

You guys should remember that it's just his personal opinion. Not going to deny Darryl is really strong with his star power but he's not S tier in every mode. Kairos probably just got rekt by Darryl and decided to put him S tier in every modes.

??? what do you mean? Also did you mean copied?

The perfect crime

Must be your WiFi because that never happens to me

He should shoot spiky sea urchins. Awesome design!
---
As i said, ur player 3 cannot accept the invite immediately. Best to tell him to wait 10 secs, enough time for u to shift player 2 to be player 1's partner and overlap player 3's invite.
---
Spend money
---
_go passive as mortis_ try harder next time of course!
---
If u don‚Äôt have all the rare brawlers unlocked then I would go for the mega box but if you do then go for token doublers cuz it‚Äôs generally better for account progress and you‚Äôre not wasting 49 gems on 1 box
---
r/lootstars ... it doesn‚Äôt add anything if there‚Äôs already a sub for it. Go there!
---
I did but I keep getting outplayed maybe a break will fix it!
---
Oni frank is a god
---
Eh, who cares, you made something, put your name in it. 
---
I LOVE this map I maxed my colt out on it and in total went up 200 hundred trophies thank you for making it.
---
Didn‚Äôt know it existed thanks

Angry Robot's HP should be reduced to 20k HP to be solo-able. Cueva profunda is basically: if there isn't a Thrower team, either a Bull or a Shelly wins. This happens 99% of the time.
---
depends on your temper and age
---
Good temper: take a break
---
Bad temper: punch things and continue losing
---
Kid: cry and bawl
---
Adult: accept and take a break or continue. if you continue always stay calm
---
Maybe because youre low in trophies (if not thats ok). I only say that because I didnt like it when I was &lt;1500 and would rather do showdown back when I was bad.
---
The frank easily, he can continuously use his super if he does it before anyone supers 
---
This hacker... SMH. uR sUPPoSeD tO SupEr IntO tHE EneMY.
---
1 mega box = 10 brawl boxes. 1000 token doublers = 10 brawl boxes. Mega box is better and it saves you one gem and you don‚Äôt even have to play to get it
---
The token doubler and the mega box both habe the value of 10 normal boxes so the special offer for the mega box is slightly better because it costs 1 gem less. 
---
Depending on how good you are in robo rumble (most consistent ticketed event) you might consider spending your gems on the ticket offers. As long as you can consistently get 27+ tokens per ticket, buying tickets is the best way to spend your gems to maximize profit. If you are not sure that you can get these 27+ tokens just buy the mega box for guaranteed value.
---
Please tell me who you are üò≠

*bookmarks for later*
---
If you were in a war, would you chose to fight a country with an enormous military or a country with a two person army
---
Yeah same he kind of drops presents or something
---
Personally, I think ninja Leon would be better, with the invisibility and all. a Kimono Piper would be cool too.
---
I thought you couldn't take two of the same brawlers into a match with your friends?
---
Perfect meme
---
It really does depend on the amount of brawlers you have cuz you will probably have a better chance at getting a brawler out of 10 boxes rather then 1
---
Supercell says they don‚Äôt care
---
what do the green and red arrows mean?
---
No
---
You can‚Äôt it was random matchmaking 
---
Yes
---
Most of the time when this happens I go online to order a new phone to replace the one I just broke /s
---
I actually just try to change brawlers or modes and if I feel like I am just playing bad because I am tilted too much I take a break
---
Use another brawler
---
Yeah I just took a break but sometimes I throw my phone on my bed XD
---
Yeah great idea
---
This happens to me every match, except I never last that long lol.
---
Basic info:
---
Time Limit: 5 mins.
---
Overtime Length: Infinite
---
Respawn time: 3s (At the middle)
---
Capture time: 10s (No matter how many brawlers are in the zone)
---
Trophy Reward: x2 (Depends on the brawler's rank)
---
(Let's say your brawler's rank is 14, in other modes you get +5 but in this mode it will be +10)
---
Turret info:
---
Damage: 280 (x2)
---
Attack Speed: 0.6s
---
Hitpoints: 5000
---
Repair Time: 20s
---
Range: Same as Jessie's Turret's Range (Dont know exactly how many tiles)
---
Mechanics:
---
1. Capture as many bases as possible
---
2. The game automatically ends when All the Bases have been captured by the team.
---
3. In case that both teams captured 2, since there is no time limit in overtime, the first team to capture the 3rd base wins.
---
4. All bases are neutral, the turrets become your allies if the base is captured (It won't be your enemy if it is in neutral mode)
---
More info:
---
- If the enemy captured your base, the Turrets will turn back and attack you instead.
---
- The Boxes on the 2 sides (Those on the purple circle) spawn every 1 minute and will drop power cubes when destroyed which give brawlers additional hp and damage (Like in showdown).
---
- The Brawler WON'T drop power cubes when they die. Only the boxes will.
---
- Everyone will respawn at the middle when they die.
---
- When the Turret reaches 0 in hp The turret automatically repairs itself, cannot be targeted, and requires 20s for it to fully repaired.
---
- The turret cannot attack while repairing.
---
- The turret's attributes WON'T change throughout the battle. It won't change whenever you rank up. It will only change though updates.
---
What do you say about my idea?
---
It‚Äôs pretty good
---
Frank's club looks like the log from CR
---
Yeah,but Darryl and Leon I'd say are now equals in power
---
same it's back :0 thx
---
I would be all for it, but the character model doesn‚Äôt quite appeal to me. But great work 
---
Sniff... sniff... I smell... IMPACT FONT
---
#REEEEEEEE
---
Me as well
---
I third this
---
Should‚Äôve called it ‚Äúliterally a bull map‚Äù
---
DID YOU ASSUMED THEIR GENDERS?!?!!
---
Two things that will never meet.
---
I lost all my friends and it kicked me from my clan with the update
---
what date is this as of? Been maining darryl cuz he was cute and never realised he was ‚Äòtop brawler‚Äô
---
It would be perfect if it wasn‚Äôt for the box placements. Those who spawn in the back are likely to end up with 1-2 powercubes while the one spawned in front are gonna get 3-5 to start its really cool tho
---
Thx it worked btw what's the new update in brawl stars Leon?
---
The purple boxes are big boxes, but it‚Äôs up to you, you‚Äôll probably get an epic before gene but if you want to test your luck then save em.
---
I like the name 
---
u/BrawlStars
---
Removed.
---
Rule 5. Repetitive or low effort posts with a low discussion potential will be removed.  
---
Thanks for the feedback back!
---
or ya know just jump on frank and interrupt his super instead
---
This shit is fuckin hype please let these be all a thing
---
then don‚Äôt auto aim
---
Fucking frank
---
this meme died in 2010
---
I prefer Ronin but Tara don't have skins, i prefer Ninja Tara :)
---
upgrade leon and grind showdown. if that doesn't work, play grab. use super to sneak on those with the gems. worst comes to worst, camp in bushes in showdown (only if you really can't, i don't suggest it) leon is still op, use his insane damage as much as possible.
---
Yes! The only online ppl i can see are the ones in my club and i can‚Äôt access replays, play is also very laggy
---
mortis
---
#NO EL PRIMO DONT DO IT
---
Uninstall the game 3 days.
---
what a funny underused reply i haven‚Äôt ever seen before!
---
Spike has the longest range dude. Try to check properly. One spike will go further then piper.Brock's range is longer then piper cuz the explosion expands 1 tile
---
I am confusion 
---
you a bot
---
r/subsithoughtifellfor
---
Can I have the link to the video?
---
best 
---
Play Brawl Ball, I think she works better there if you can land your supers well.
---
NANI?
---
or just remove auto aim completely
---
Wait, so colt's middle name is shelldon?
---
Ah ok alright cool
---
I use colt for this map. Dynamike and barley are also good for pressing peeps so do duo and use barley/dynamike
---
I don't think that because he's a legendary he needs a buff. What I'm saying is that if you have Spike or Leon, there isn't really a reason to pick Crow. I never said that because he's a legendary he should simply get a buff so he's stronger than any other brawler lower in rarity. In fact Pam is one of the strongest in the current meta as well as Daryl. 
---
Oof
---
I was facing the same situation as you a few hours ago, but I failed.
---
Yeah, most of them were auto-aiming
---
What if he uses the invincibility frames to somehow kill both?
---
Literally every gamemode except solo showdown is made for 3v3
---
So no
---
Ugh they‚Äôre gonna nerf Rico bc of this
---
Power Cubes? I think you mean...
---
#GEMS
---
you got a point
---
but showdown is, like, big
---
I get that I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs not impossible, it‚Äôs not gonna be easy though without shotgunners.
---
Dang that's really good!
---
mortis is a brawler in brawl stars
---
The benefit is if you open them now you don't have a chance to get him. And you do if you wait to open them. So if you're interested in a chance to get gene over the other brawlers you literally have to wait.
---
You don't need to downvote my comments just because you don't understand them lol. 
---
The mixed song. You don't know what emotion it is, but it's really good.
---
Well I think it‚Äôs a great game mode, and many seem to enjoy it, just like me. I farmed my Dynamike, my Frank,  my Jessie, my Nita, and most recently, my Crow to 500+ on Brawl Ball maps, it‚Äôs definitely my favourite game mode. With the recent spawn time increase, it‚Äôs a lot more tolerable to play than when it just came out.
---
Conversely, I hate Gem Grab with a goddamn passion, turnovers because of bad teammates that eventually lead to a steam roll are so annoying. But apparently a lot of people like Gem Grab, and I‚Äôm fine with that.
---
Obviously it‚Äôs not impossible, but just with long range maps, the same applies here times 6 since you can‚Äôt even see your opponent.
---
Holy crap he looks even thicker
---
Holy shit
---
Except that Darryl‚Äôs roll automatically cancels Frank‚Äôs windup time. So if one of those Darryls are smart enough to roll out and watch chaos ensue, game over for the Frank.
---
Yeah I get ya
---
I understood, but if you read I said there‚Äôs no statistical advantage to hoard boxes to increase chances like OP asked. Yes, if you want Gene that badly then save them so Gene is in the pool. 
---
And I didn‚Äôt downvote your post, those are others whom actually can read and agree with me. 
---
It must have been the skinüòÇüëåüëç

What a beast game hay day is
---
So now you're saying that crow needs a buff because 2 brawlers are stronger than him lol. Regardless, crow actually does have a role, he brings Leon's assassination and Spikes control. He really isn't as under powered as you think.
---
#and the el primo kills the whole team somehow
---
Uhh does someone mind translating this?
---
And then killed by a camping bull
---
*gets gene 20 years later*
---
He would be close range and wouldn‚Äôt be able
---
To fire over walls and his fire wouldn‚Äôt last as long as barely‚Äôs but I could see the similarities 
---
Np
---
Why would they make crow a mythic?
---
Aye
---
I like angry robo üò° 
---
There is a reason why projectiles cant be covered which is it makes harder to determine friendly and enemy shots

Sorry a fucking cactus beat her.
---
Thx Piper
---
Power level 4 but 300 trophys..? Doesn't seem that underpowered
---
oh ok
---
So I have a Samsung tab 4 I tried getting brawl stars but the actual graphics don't appear (playfield, player model, etc.) Please help, I don't know if it's the actual tablet or just the game.
---
what super going to be
---
I actually like the Tara skin out of the 3 but overall, awesome concepts!! I love them!!!
---
Nice tits
---
I guess it‚Äôs a pretty good map, but I‚Äôm a salty player and I always get mad when people snipe from the water
---
Not sure, heard a bunch of people talking about it
---
Boom Beach: Am I a joke to you?
---
I never had my game crashed before january update but now its all the time! Really wish they fix it for once 
---
You just copy other‚Äôs ideas 
---
When people are talking about nerfing Leon and buffing crow and you havent unlocked nita.
---
Eyyy thanx! Got my boi crow! :D
---
u/Frank_supercell
---
Could be simple. Like maybe he has extra health when in his wolf form. Stuff like this really help brawlers.
---
lmao, I commented saying that Mortis needed a hat...and now there is one...I claim full credit.
---
ALSO, the default Frank has no fingernails, but the Caveman frank does have fingernails...are you a part of fingernail gang, or not?
---
If this was about teaming in SS it would be ‚Äújump into battle and team up.‚Äù
---
No, the battle will be rare. (Do you get the joke?)
---
That's actually kinda cool
---
Yet dynamike litterly does take the L when he wins.
---
I still remember u/PingPong433 or something like that made a tier list that puts colt and crow in list S
---
Too many boxes
---
U finna die now there is two of us
---
Aha gotta flex on them you know
---
Let it gooooooooo let it gooooooooooo
---
This is good to know üëÄ
---
I‚Äôm confused why like a fourth of the comments claim this stuff happens every day. This is amazing! I wish I had this amount of skill lol
---
yes
---
I‚Äôve been wanting to see my total kills since I first started playing. Maybe show the kills only on the game modes that are about kills like bounty, showdown and the ticketed events 
---
Hey I don't want problems from y'all do
---
You need a lot more grind to max out in hayday. 
---
I mean yes it is but it just confusing me the whole time
---
Yooooooo I hope you took a selfie with him. I didn‚Äôt know they based brawlers off of real life creations! All details down to the point. 
---
Current omes cuter
---
*ground
---
Amazing! 
---
Not really 
---
matchmaking isn‚Äôt based on total trophies
---
So what‚Äôs the point of the gems then lol
---
 ''Decreased the skill queue time from 1s to 0.3s (how long the skill is  queued for casting when casting before the previous skill has ended)'' Thats means that before, when you shooted a load, there was a time of 1s between when you click and when it shoot, and now its only 0.3 secs, so now you can shoot all your 3 loads a lot faster. Thats mean that you will have a lot less time to react to a bull in a bush before he kill you, nice!
---
Reasons I didn't do that also
---
1. Hardly draws
---
2. Didn't stay on end screen
---
3. Did not turn on Music
---
4. Didn't Record 
---
5. Already forgotten the music 
---
6. Can't record audio
---
Buying decorations and speeding things up

I got a 700 trophy Mortis but he‚Äôs absolute shit in the meta and has been since landscape
---
Objective **survive**
---
I cant max him out because i dont have enough points..... Ffffu
---
Btw this was done on my phone, so minimal details are harder to do but this still works lol
---
I am not an observant man
---
I like this
---
Spike is really good at being in control, meaning you never have to really run at people and gun them down to win, You can easily maintain your position and push them into bad situations. Since he has a scatter shot that can hit you from around corners or really long range, no one ever really tries to get near him unless they have a good engage. So don't go all Rambo on him unless you're big enough to do so safely, focus more on controlling the people around you. If done right you can push people into fights with each other and just do damage from afar. 
---
This joke is so old 
---
By teaming lol
---
No it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs based on brawler trophies

How so? He‚Äôs got a pretty op basic attack with the obnoxious poison, one of the fastest movement speed brawlers, and a super that is capable of bursting enemies down or escape them.

I'm at 5000 and have all the brawlers except for leon and crow. I'm f2p and started in 2018

The best mode imo

Why would the teamers stop shooting the pulled mike?  If it was a large team then they would gladly kill the separated guy, let alone "be afraid to shoot"
---
I have 8k havent got a new brawler in 4 months

This is the lowest quality post i have ever seen

I meant to draw them but I forgot :/

Leon is dope I wish I got him instead of spike, not a huge fan of him so far he‚Äôs still power 1 tho

As a Japanese person, these skins are very cool! My favorite has to be either the Oni Frank or the Mortis. Oni for frank is such a great idea!

I dont think its that p2w especially compared to cr coc. It just makes it faster. You could get the same lvl and trophies if your good and play regularly.

This is balanced wdym

Save your shot to keep control of an area. Of the enemies see that you spammed 3 shots they will push you and you will probably lose because you have to reload
---
well you can see when a brawler has star power...
---
Nice man, congrats 
---
Best for tokens 
---
Wow there's two leons
---
Love how people who just check the bushes are considered hacker by noobsüòÇ
---
This is good my friend.
---
That jumping el primo probably has 10 gems
---
Here's a strategy that many people are using to counter teaming, so just team with a high damage close range brawler, and then kill them once they get close. So eventually everyone will be to paranoid to team
---
*they see me spinning
---
Supercell has to hire people like you to do these type of stuff for them 
---
That bed doesn‚Äôt look comfy in the slightest, the covers are literally rectangular at the edge
---
Are u dumb
---
What if it was just a barley skin
---
Only maxed out people with all brawlers should do that. By saving on brawl boxes, you‚Äôre hindering your progress. At least I‚Äôm assuming you ain‚Äôt maxed at 3000 trophies
---
Wow ! 
---
Lmao wtf I have the same issue I have 48 gems with 49 box offer
---
nice
---
Flairs check out
---
Best tip: don‚Äôt use him

thx :D

Why would you start saving boxes for Gene if you just unlocked Bo
---
Very nice bruddah

I love this idea however I feel like youtubers will influence people what maps they should choose, as well as picking similar or the same maps over and over again.

Hey it‚Äôs joeycipp, the colt who was in OGs vid with Toma the Shelly below you, lol I got reset too there are 4 accounts with a 0 trophy rank 20 brawler pretty op. How many cups are you at on your main ? 
---
This is a cool idea but In showdown would he boost himself? 
---
I know that‚Äôs why I said if frank uses his super before anyone else 
---
that will looks cool

looks like mortis in his final form

We should make a mortis clan for pro mortis users

Pretty obvious choice, but I would like to see it happen!

Damn that‚Äôs 5 in the morning for me.. well I‚Äôll be there!

What is the trophy push exploit
---
Sort of. But there are so many petition posts. I should not miss an upvote or get downvoted for titling it petition
---
wtf
---
Go to shop, scroll down to the mega box or big box and click on them, click on the ‚Äòi‚Äô and then you will see your drop rates. As for the first question I don‚Äôt know.
---
The chances are known when you go tok shop. Go to any box and pick the big I icon on the left. There it will show you your chances. The name thing is but it's risky so I wouldn't try it.
---
\*plays b in cavern church/feast or famine\*

But they can just run over him and his Super stops lol.
---
I know a dude with 11K trophies and missing 2 legendaries. Been playing since launch, hasn‚Äôt gotten a brawler in like 6-8 months and his legendary luck is around 0.3 last I asked. 
---
Don‚Äôt complain till you get to that point. 
---
Nice drawing 
---
Name color is &lt;c#&gt; (name here up to 6 letters) &lt;/c&gt; any number 1-9 i believe. And chances only really increase when clearing a previous rarity. However there is a luck factor for legendary brawlers each time you open a box and dont get one it goes up slightly. I have all 22 and granted i have paid some $, i got 2 yellows free.
---
Lol, there was another post where someone wanted to lose a gem so there coins, tickets, and gems would all be at 7.
---
Thanks but I dint get the name thing

So, I personally don't mind teaming. However, I also don't mind backstabbing. If I can take my teammate down at no risk, I'd definitely go for it. But there's no reason to backstab when your teammate and you have developed some basic trust, and you can help each other secure higher places. Big groups of teams are still cancer, but the 2-3 man teams are alright if you ask me. Also, just don't let brawlers like that get close. I'll usually shoot them once, and then spin to indicate that I don't trust them. The brawlers that I never team with are Brock, Tara, Crow, and the shotgunners/tanks, simply because those are the ones that will most often backstab.
---
God i had the same mortis skin idea! Awesome drawing btw
---
Pray to rng
---
You see... 4/5 people disagree with you üòÜ
---
we used to get 20. 10 is enough, as you can rank up a brawler 19 times and there are 22 brawlers( 22x19x10=4180= nearly 42 brawl boxes)
---
SOY EL MEJOR!!!! 
---
Darryl is All-Roaunder

I know that there are a lot of games out there with Control Point style game modes (never said this was original). Usually there are multiple points you can capture at the same time, but what I wanted for this is only one active point at a time as that seem to fit better within BrawlStars. I haven‚Äôt played TF2 specifically, but I would assume you fight over multiple bases there as well. But yeah, this idea was definitely inspired by other games! However as long as it‚Äôs a fun idea and don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a problem ;)
---
Hey kairos, I love your vids and I'll try to get to the ama, it will be at 7:30 for me.

Mortis-The Bringer of Death
---
I‚Äôve been eyeing out on Piper since I‚Äôve started, and she‚Äôs the most recent brawler I‚Äôve got and my current favourite! But now, I‚Äôm stuck with her at 380-400 trophies because of Darryl and Mortis‚Äô popularity skyrocketed, I get bullied every time I see them.. Plus, the new maps for Bounty don‚Äôt favour her much too..
---
But still, I really enjoy using her!
---
Hey if you‚Äôre going with the Japan theme, I‚Äôve got a few ideas for you: Sumo Primo, Samurai Bo (like the proper Sengoku era samurai who mostly used bow and arrows), Geisha Poco (I dunno how this would work, but artists are creative), and Lucky Cat Penny.
---
I want life leech back, but I would rather see healing mushroom go.

Its really good cavern churn is the worst because every player is a bull and its shit...this is one of the best maps but the only problem is that it is really teaming-heavy :/

I kno2 bud but supercell doesnt care because they are dumb as shit. Everything is so unbalanced, basically when I play showdown I cant push because of teaming, when I play 3v3s i cant push because of randoms,if I play with my friends,they are also trash at 3v3s so what should I do?
---
Cavern op with Rico and throwers. 
---
Supercel really needs to hire you.

Don‚Äôt worry I was just like that. But I used my mom card to get Leon üòÉ

Replace his gummy balls with the bombs on the old Rico and it's good.

So they spawn and instantly die from a bull?

I was wondering anyone loose to normal mode Boss. Lol

Matchmaking isn't based on levels, they just rushed their bralwers up
---
I can only think of 3 reasons why this is: 1.most people haven‚Äôt check it out yet 2.the people who have checked it out lost on normal 3.it‚Äôs bugged SIDE NOTE:if you‚Äôre playing with high trophies there‚Äôs always less people to queue up with
---
I dont get it
---
Supercell hate only players free to play like me
---
Having the same issue. Don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs about but hopefully it gets fixed soon. 
---
I'm not on high trophies. Tried it with rank 10. Guess its just bugged

It‚Äôs happening to everyone

The Dev team is aware and are working on it üëç

No one cares. Keep it in that sub.

How's everyone going with this boss? I finally defeated the first one after about 8 tries - my teammates couldn't work out that they should try to stay alive if 2 of the other members are dead. They would literally run straight up to the boss and die.

Teaming gone wrong

what makes you think that? she has decent dps(about 1000 a shot) with the ability to hit up to three targets which can really help with dealing with minions when they start piling up, and her turret can essentially be a 4th dps source if used right

and they die every 7 seconds

ELLLLLLLL PRRRIIIIMMMMOOOOO
---
(Classic)
---
High much?
---
His health its sooooo low it's pitiful. Hes a good brawler, i got him to 300 with duo showdown but now its almost impossible to use him. If you have him, you would know. Compared to other legendaries like leon or spike, the difference is obvious.
---
Just click the image and zoom in lol
---
Yea, and I would try to kill those who attempt to team with me

Totally agree with you

Don‚Äôt get me started on the people who have two legendaries in their shop. That‚Äôs literally 100 dollars. That‚Äôs insane lol

Y'all complain about teaming but I don't see any of you making efforts to bring back the only map where teaming was not possible: Life Leech-Feast or Famine. How come over 70% of all players want it back so much, yet everyone is ok with dealing with it while being a slave and spending money on the game...
---
This is drawn insanely well!
---
I am sure that he miss because he aims instead of use auto aim

You‚Äôll get them eventually. You should buy token doublers instead. You may unlock them from the boxes you earn.

Because the boss is much more manageable in his first stage, so building up power cubes is easier. All the DOTs can be mopped up easier. Lots of good reasons not to drive the boss to his second and third stage.

Errrr how much of a spoiled brat is his guy, my legendary chances are around the same as his and i have 8.75 cups and he says 500 cups like its a lot hah thats cute
---
I think for me,I reccomend by putting an option for low/mid/high quality to boost up i guess.
---
Maybe I should do it... what do you guys think 
---
Is that based on time? Or on health? If it‚Äôs time than I get going agro an driving his health down. But if it‚Äôs health than I don‚Äôt understand why you would drive him into his 2nd and 3rd stage until you had a decent amount of power cubes.
---
The boss will go to the next stages based on time, not based on damage received, so if you wait youll have to take all his hp off when hes at his strongest
---
I also got my 2nd legendary (spike) today . Got leon last month i am at 2.7k trophies

ah alright, thought it was you because of the profile screenshot, thanks! :p

Okay, I hope you're trolling. They spent 3 years and money on it? Like come on, there are actual AAA developers who have been making actual games for longer than 3 years of them to be either canceled or non-profitable.   
---
It did not take them that much money, nor that much time, the only reason they have been doubting the release is because they thought the game wouldn't be as profitable as other tittles have.   
---
Yep, they do, what's your point? They are flexing you new ways to spend your money with every update they make, and it's okay, I don't care, I just want fair matchmaking. The more I read your post the more I doubt you even read mine.

Exactly, DYNAMIKE IS A COUNTER TO BULL, but how is it possible that when I'm playing Bull, I'm constantly being matched against my counter? Isn't it a little bit off? As if it rigged so I lose a little bit? 
---
Okay, just realized, you are a troll.   
---
I care
---
Nice.
---
Dont forget the gem grab primo thing
---
They changed how Matchmaking works earlier this week. See this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/anr35b/maintenance\_inbound/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/anr35b/maintenance_inbound/)

Even if it‚Äôs not good, if something‚Äôs for free, I‚Äôll be Glad to take it. If someone offers you $1, you don‚Äôt say it‚Äôs too little fk off, just take it, it‚Äôs better than absolutely nothing. 
---
how does one get an image of a brawler asserting dominance (T-posing)?
---
Thanks for the tip
---
Yep. They update their game. With cosmetics. So they can earn more money. Wow, what a gentle and generous game developers they are mate! 
---
I do agree with the second part, as soon as ''loss strike'' stars, I make a pause, because anger affects the gameplay. I'm not really talking about it tho, but how it seems to be rigged. 
---
needs a fucking hat and scarf
---
He also needs air pods.
---
Well, don't use auto aim then...
---
Kill them
---
DONT BE WEEK
---
water Mark Will SHOW THEM
---
You gotta keep your distance, try to hit 2 spikes ir if u r very skilled 3 (its very diffucult at long range) and use his super to slow down people and crush them or to kill low life brawlers that hide behind walls.pd he is my favourite brawler üòç
---
Luckily, he hasn‚Äôt bit into it yet
---
Yep, they are, but they now they are, and they won't try to convice you that they are not.  
---
While on the other hand, Supercell is trying to act as if they CARE ABOUT YOU, they don't.   
---
And it's okay really, I don't expect a corporation to watch after my fat ass, I just want a balanced matchmaking. 
---
My friend literally came up with this like, a week ago
---
Mortis: Omae Wa Mou...Shindeiru
---
Teaming Cancer: *NANI???*
---
Oh, Thats reverse mortis XD
---
You‚Äôre not wrong, but I‚Äôd have more incentive to grind if I got more for levelling up. My experience level is 60 and I don‚Äôt even bother paying attention to it because of how long it takes. 
---
Definitely one of the least creative sub Reddit‚Äôs I‚Äôve taken part in. You can tell most of the people here are in the 10-15 yr old range 
---
i got spike and crow at 3k which ruined my chances of leon. Im at 0.0240 rn dont wry ull get one of em soon
---
Dinamike killed Shelly )))
---
Heh that's good
---
And I am upvoting yours
---
I had this offer till I had spike.       
---
Now it‚Äôs only crow
---
why does the language matter. there's barely any in game chatting
---
try to hit from an angle getting that 3rd spike cld be a game changer
---
Oh my special offer was Spike 
---
This is 100% accurate
---
These low effort posts are getting even worse, they went from bad to trash
---
Same here, rewards/difficulty and everything else still counts as master though.
---
You missed ‚Äúinvisible Leon‚Äù or has that meme does already
---
Is a sckeleton
---
Also had this
---
it IS enough. There's plenty of players reaching 500+ trophies per brawler as F2P and having several brawlers maxed with Star Power. Players that have maxed their Brawlers have no incentive to ever pay real money in the game (except for skins). If they aren't going to spend any money then SC isn't going to earn any money.
---
Try thinking a step further than just "it takes too long to get X or Y". They need to pace the game so that it's feasable to be competetive as F2P but at the same time there needs to be something for the dolphins/whales to spend their money on. As so many others have stated already, Brawl Stars is SC's most F2P friendly game they've made so far, and people still complain about not getting enough rewards/progress as F2P.
---
Oh, and I can say that someone is wrong if their opinion is actually wrong. Otherwise you could say "His opinion is that the earth is flat you can't say his opinion is wrong." However, I can't say that you aren't entitled to your opinion, that's a different argument alltogether.
---
F, Crow will be my last brawler as of now
---
How did you got powercubes??
---
Here's no sense in killing enemies,before changing spawn point,it.at least made sense because u have time to score,now,you haven't got any chance.
---
Soon I may reach that point but no crow      
---
Now my chances is 0.0096%
---
mortis is s tier reeee
---
Not at all , they are way to get they‚Äôll both come eventually . 
---
2 hours to go

Pff Shaggy can‚Äôt die while using his 1% of power

God mode üòÇ
---
I have acctually got him on 500,I think he is one of the better brawlers, but on the other hand I dont have spike and leon
---
No buy spike or leon
---
Coming from the guy bragging about trophies in a game? Yeah I'm definitely the out of shape one of us
---
Just search up on yde, he beat insane 8.
---
those tickets are so value
---
It‚Äôs kind of hilarious how many gacha game communities would kill for guaranteed unit pulls or purchaseable units and then when some game does that the community calls it shameful. I suppose that community will never be happy as long as a game has real money involved...
---
this is the first time I‚Äôve ever seen a mortis not team on solo 
---
its a scammer that guy he asks u to give him your supercell id and he will steal your account
---
They could have a info-board with info on upcoming updates (e.g. Gene is coming), as well as info like "We are aware of matchmaking issue when trying to queue for Boss Fight on Hard Mode and are working on it". LoL already uses this system with ? next to the play button, and I think it's a great idea, since it gives you info whether it's worth queueing at that moment or if it is better to just wait a bit until it's fixed.
---
I dont play to much to be honest with you, and I am also working out so yeah, Nice oneüëç

If a person doesn't accept help from others they shouldn't complain

---
and Bull's wife
---
I helped my friend fix their turret.
---
Got it. Updated the post, this is my first post on Reddit since a long time and also on BS
---
Same situation, only brawlers left. I passed personally as 50 dollars is too steep for me. That's a full game or multiple micro-transactions in the future. I'd rather just roll the dice on a box giving one up eventually. 
---
maybe it‚Äôs because all but one of the modes are team based
---
Okay so with your logic of more trophies, I play even less... And I'm a PT and sport scientist solo üëçüèª
---
What did thicochet do did he go on a diet 
---
I'm guessing you have all other super rare brawlers and your trophy count is low enough that you're not getting offers for epic/mythic/legendary brawlers.
---
Everyone has that
---
Challenge: *Normal*
---
Oh ok I'll do that

Only that point isnt 3600 but more like 7000-8000

---
So you think that a game that you can't complete on your own is a good game? 
---
I'm not a noob. Still, looking up guides should never be the default course of action.
---
Haha yes I love this gameplay
---
Makes sense for SuperCell ahah
---
I hope they do
---
Do you have a mp3 of the music
---
Close and reopen the game.
---
Maybe I just lost interest
---
People keep picking penny and I get destroyed :(
---
Got it with 20 tickets and primo glitch with sweet token dubbler
---
Move skin ideas and ‚Äúpetitions‚Äù up to the top of the list because the kids on this reddit care more about skins than they do a balanced, complete game
---
power cubes üî≤üî≤üî≤
---
Not underpowered just not playing him right. Treat him as a pest. Slowly ticking people‚Äôs hp down and using your super to escape or jump on enemies
---
Thx for the glitch.
---
Also Leon is super helpful with his super, so he should be recommended too
---
the nostalgia..
---
Cool! 
---
Not for canadians
---
You colt-of made a better joke... 
---
I‚Äôm the best with him but I just needed to show this bc it makes a sound and gets annoying 
---
Im speaking about teamers obiviously....
---
That's just any difficulty when both my teammates are defeated and I'm playing as Jessie. Specifically when the tiny robots come after you.
---
Great idea!
---
no he didint, he grabbed his invisible glasses.
---
Ive already opened 5, and only got pam :|
---
Your post doesn‚Äôt make any indication whatsoever that you‚Äôre talking about teamers
---
How it feels to be chased by Bull
---
The same offer is 779 for me, reduced from 1050
---
Slap the blue one already!!! 
---
I got 5th
---
"Serious shotgun shot"
---
One Super Shelly
---
lol that would be impressive if you did all the damage by yourself, that could be a cool challenge. probably could do the first few idk about the 3rd or 4th +
---
Reminds me of Dragon Quest's priests
---
Around 9400 damage with a single punch i think
---
well I mean I have Mortis
---
The circle looks weird too
---
It's editef
---
You seem new to the game and the subreddit
---
0,1344
---
She is a mediocre brawler
---
Wtf
---
Did you contact supercell support ?
---
*only*
---
1.59 with Pam Darryl and Colt, I'd think any of them would be good. Jessie, Rico and maybe Nita, Shelly or Spike could be good too or Leon
---
Tanks are balanced. Good at some maps, and that's it. You are just at low trophies
---
stop
---
Person of Interest!
---
Dude............play mortis
---
pam, colt, bull. is pretty solid. 
---
and im 12600 :P #SmallFlex lol. 
---
I like it but I think it'd play like garbage. It looks far too close quartered and there's a perfect cubby spot for Dynamike and Barley.

Put your willy in them

Idk I just found it on Google

"I will be back"

They will never add that
---
What comp did you use to get past insane 1?
---
Lol thats actually a really good point 
---
reasonable reason to break your phone
---
They have said they won't do anything as teaming is just another strategy
---
Except for the part where there's like 4 dynamikes in the picture and the text references multiple "people" but ya other than that there's zero indication of teaming.
---
You missed the fact that there's 5 dynamikes?
---
For my enemies it's "going for that dude that didn't even try to attack you once and was just breaking a box"
---
How can I be in your in-game friend list? I really want to be a friend of a famous, handsome and pro person like you. 
---
How does it make no indication to teamers? There‚Äôs a group of like 4 Dynamikes lmao

Hello Kairos my questions are...
---
1) Who is your favourite brawler?
---
2) When did you decide to be a full time youtuber?
---
3) What would you like us subscribers to do for you?
---
4) Do you watch My hero academia and/or dragon ball z?
---
5) Are you willing to start any other game whether of supercell or not?
---
7) Who would you rather pick charmander squirtle or bulbasaur?
---
8) You probably missed my question number 6) lol
---
9) You just checked that 
---
 Sorry for the long post and here's a picture of potato to compensate for it...
---

Whenever I play Pokemon I need 3 save spots, one for my Charmander, one for my Squirtle, and one for my second Charmander.

Agree, I rather hv the previous match making. Feel more balanced

Bro.. first of all i want you to know that i LOVE you and your channel.. your still my favourite youtuber along with Lex and Rey! Huge support and ‚ù§ from me! Kiss the cute baby Kairos for me üíû
---
Questions:
---
1. Does your wife play Brawl Stars and are you gonna do a video with her where you Brawl together?
---
2. Is there anything in Brawl Stars that annoys you a lot (like crashes, lags, teamers #stopthespin, etc)?
---
3. Do you think that one day Brawl Stars will be out on PC and consoles?
---
4. How do you feel about the Brawl Stars community and do you think its growing fast?
---
5. When did you start playing Brawl Stars? Was it shortly after Supercell released it?
---
Thts all for now.. i have many more but cant think of them fast.. anyways stay awesome and positive! Ignore all the hate (if there is any).. and lastly i wanna say, i wanna see more collabs and vlogs (hopefully in future) between you and SheLLex üíûüíó‚ù§

---
Thanks so much!
---
Haha Death Note IS actually my favorite anime. I've seen it like 4 times and I hardly ever re-watch shows because my favorite part of watching a show is when they can surprise me with something I don't expect.
---
I've also watched all of, and thoroughly enjoyed:
---
* Naruto
---
* Fairy Tail
---
* One Punch Man
---
* Attack on Titan
---
* Hunter X Hunter
---
* Assassination Classroom
---
* Hitman Reborn
---
That is only a small fraction of all the anime I've watched lol
---
A simple question
---
Can you in front of dev team give your impression then they will listen to you?
---
If yes can you ask them to up Crow? ;-;
---
What is the best brawler way to kill teamers ? Subscriber from Senegal üëãüèø.

its for people who want it

Hi Kairos, I just want to say i‚Äôve been watching your YT videos for over a year. I‚Äôve learned so much about the game from them. After playing for over a year and loving it, there remains 1 confusing part of the game to me.. and that‚Äôs the progression and ranking system. If you follow sports, you‚Äôll see Baseball has a World Series, Football has a Super Bowl and Esports has tournaments and other competitions. But in Brawl Stars, a highly competitive game, there‚Äôs actually no point in increasing your trophies and there‚Äôs no recognition for winning. Almost zero recognition. Imagine being an NBA player and instead of the Playoffs at the end of the year to determine the best team, they just have a big pizza party and say it doesn‚Äôt matter if you win or lose just that you‚Äôre enjoying. For casual players this is alright for competitive players this would be absurd. Brawl Stars to me feels like the competition where there‚Äôs no emphasis on winning, it‚Äôs more about participation. Like going to a soccer tournament and there not bieng a 1st place 2nd or 3rd place but everyone gets a participation ribbon. I can‚Äôt unsrtstand if Brawl Stars is a casual game or a serious game. Why does is not matter whether you have 2 trophies 22 trophies 2222 trophies or 222222 trophies.. really all are treated the same. And with players over 500 trophies losing trophies after season reset, it just feels like you‚Äôre being punished for actually advancing in the game. I know late game content will he added and right now the focus is on expanding the player base (and maintaining it). But my question is this: is Brawl Stars a powder puff game where everyone is a winner, or does it value competition and recognizing its top talent. Please give me an original answer and not this is something they will address in the future. Bc this is the only response I ever hear. Really what I want to know is why are the players that put in the most time, effort, money and energy to the game given zero recognition and is Brawl Stars a big soccer game where everyone gets a participation ribbon but we don‚Äôt recognize a 1st place or 2nd. The top players in Brawl Stars are so talented, like sick talented and they get no credit. Nothing. Zero. This aspect of the game is confusing to me. In NBA we hear about Lebron James, Fortnite it‚Äôs Ninja but Brawl Stars it‚Äôs nobody.. and it‚Äôs this type of neglect that is really strange to me. Please give a thoughtful answer bc I know this is a tough question and very easy to just brush off with.. they‚Äôll add late game content in the future. Thanks 
---
When Supercell realizes it's not good for the game and either makes it a bannable offense, or implements something in the game to naturally make it a less effective strategy
---
If you steal from a brock or a jessie, they can get over it. If you steal from Nita, you've entered a blood feud.
---
High trophies is where he shines. He doesn't need a buff
---
How? 
---
Hi Kairos.Tell me what you think about One Piece but first have you seen One Piece¬ø
---
I was tricking them , but a hard to trick bull was often on me üòí
---
Can i play with you and lex ? And add you as friends ? 
---
Can you give me a new brawler because Im nlg getting any :(
---
Any tips on beating the boss fight mode at the moment?

Amazing

Gene sucks ass honestly Mortis is better and mortis is one of the worst brawlers :/
---
I can play later on. you shud add me 
---
Lol I am refreshing every minute to see the progress you made with the replies and how far is mine.
---
You have sorted by top right? {I don't know if this will get a reply and I think the odds are low so anyway GL}
---
Dyna-dream
---
Hi **Kairo** ! I wanted ti know, do you play games other than Brawl Stars, also if you do what games do you play? And do you think that Gene is going to be OP (I personally dont, he seems preety fine and balanced)?
---
If you replay thank you! Also if you dont reply nevermind, there are better questions than myüôÇüòâ!
---
I saw that too
---
Hi, Kairos! How do you manage to make YouTube a full-time job, without any sponsors in the videos? Oh, and where are you born and where you live now?
---
What does Brawl Stars need to do to maintain or expand their popularity in the future like what Clash of Clans has managed to achieve? 
---
I got a frank
---
Bo nanza
---
If you were to be a brawler what would be your attack, super, star power . (Btw big fan of yours!)
---
In my opinion , his super has to be revamped
---
REEEPOST
---
(* Sorry for bad Grammar in advance!)
---
Basycally, for this Stratagie to work, you need (*best would be Maxed) Leon! The Core part is, that in Insanety 1 and Higher, the Boss drops Powercubes after Taking some Damage. Leon must take most/all of the for the Stratagie to work! Leon's job Mostly is to STAY ALIVE! Leon runs around the Map, Aggroing the Rockets (*Which always Target the Brawler farvest away from the Boss), killing Bots, getting the Cubes and also sometimes Dealing Damage to the Boss! This works, because Leon's high Speed and Close up Damage makes him easy to Survive! The Other 2 Focus on Dealing Damage to the Boss (*and also not Diying ;) )! Best Paired is Leon with other good Survivable Bralers like Pam and Bull! P.s.: FOR FOX SAKE, DONT USE FRICKING SHELLY FOR THIS! Sorry for the Long Post, here's a Potatoe!ü•î
---
Crow definitely needs a buff 
---
Yeah for real. I only have a level 8 brawler so I haven‚Äôt got that far haha. Started playing a week after global release. 
---
Join my club or send inv link
---
so this popped up for me but it was Crow and Piper...
---
that was right after reset.
---
this AM, when i opened the game (about7 hrs later), it was Piper and Spike.
---
not sure why it changed
---
How do you make vid√©os so fastly ?, you sad that you had returned from germany yesterday, and now a vid√©o was released in your channel.
---
I know a lot youtubers that barely do one vid√©o per week !üòÇ
---
Oh, I have not seen it
---
Congrats m8!
---
Favorite anime? Mine is Assassination Classroom
---
Its not terrible, but it‚Äôs basically a piper super (which isn‚Äôt too good either, once an enemy is close you‚Äôre already dead, and the delay doesn‚Äôt help at all). 
---
Yeah it needs at least *something*.
---
Nice nickname choice
---
Can you make another parody about brawl stars like you did for all star? I really liked it 
---
Hi there Arispy 
---
For real  
---
Hi KairosTime. I‚Äôve been a subscriber since the CR days. I have a few questions. 
---
1. What got you into anime?
---
2. With what do you write? A fountain pen, rollerball pen or on a computer? If you use a fountain pen, what model?
---
3. Prefered brawler?
---
4. And what do you use for recording?
---
5. How did you get the idea for your yourube name?
---
If my grammar seems broken. Please tell me. English is not my first language and better correct it now then later.
---
In order of when they were released
---
* Hay Day - not my kind of game, though it's incredibly consistent in it's performance according to the Hay Day community manager
---
* Clash of Clans - I played this game SO hardcore for it's first 3 years. LOVE IT!!! Eventually got too hardcore and had to stop when Clash Royale was released because I was addicted and spent too much time on it lol
---
* Boom Beach - A cool spin-off of Clash of Clans. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had waited to play until it was more developed. I got bored of it early on because I was enjoying CoC so much
---
* Clash Royale - I freaking LOVED this game. This was where I started my YouTube channel! Eventually it became very repetitive (same thing over &amp; over again), and the steep paywall left me excited to stop playing when I started playing Brawl Stars
---
   * Both those issues aren't a problem in Brawl Stars, which is why I think I love the game so much
---
Bonus Tipp, when using Close range Brawlers against those Sniper-Bots, Run in Circles Around them, and use walls to make them come Close up! (* As seen in the Replay)
---
Nice newsletter tho xd
---
Me
---
I do!
---
Kairos, I‚Äôve got a few questions.
---
1. Do you think every brawler can be pushed to 500 only doing showdown? I am my second in my club with 6250 trophies and can‚Äôt find many high trophie players to push with me. I‚Äôm pushing every brawler to 300 right now and almost complete.
---
2. Who between Leon and spike would you think is better.
---
3. Do you think crow needs a buff?
---
Thank you!
---
Took some time writing the Rest ;)
---
OOO ROM√ÇNA»òII 
---
Thank you for doing this!
---
I recently acquired spike. Really excited, but I suck with him. Do you have any general tips to push him! Thanks! (Love your videos!)
---
Hi kairos im a big fan and i have one question 
---
do skills pay the bills
---
Do your kids play brawl stars? If not, you should make a video where you play with them and see how bad they are. If they do, I recommend you
---
To make a competition against them like who ends with more stars in bounty 
---
I'm not making that public quite yet. Mostly because I haven't decided how I want my work to impact their personal lives. So, Kid Kairos &amp; Baby Kairos until further notice lol
---
Will supercell bring back the maps that they removed because a lot of them were actually good and comminity favorites. Also they forgot to remove kaboom canyon lol
---
Seeing as you want a new competitive gamemode, if you could make your own gamemode what would it be?
---
What‚Äôs the code
---
When and why you decide to make a YT channel?
---
you and lex are dads.u guys spend time on brawl stars and family.that's rare dude.hope you will be more success.much love from Bangladeshüòä
---
Haha I grew up LOVING sponge bob!
---
My turn is near I guess you are doing a great job kairos it's really hard to reply to this load of comments.
---
I like it!
---
Awful idea. That mechanic should never exist for spawned things
---
I think Supercell either needs to start banning people for very clear teaming (which I doubt they'll do because they don't have a support team large enough to do this), or they need to make event mods permanently active in Showdown. I think those are the simplest solutions. If something more complicated could work that would also encourage a very natural way to discourage teaming in Solo Showdown, I'd love to hear it
---
Hey I actually have some questions about anime since I really enjoy anime too!
---
1- Favorite genre

3- Whether you watch seasonal anime and if yes ehat is your favorite anime this season?

#BOSS WENT THICCO MODE
---
Hey Kairos! I was wondering if you had a dedicated group of Clubs that everyone could join to support you. 
---
Ikr me2
---
the same thing happened to me with pam. what happened when you tried buying it?
---
Do you think that Brawl Stars will be relevant for the next few years just like Clash of Clans and Clash Royale were in their time?
---
Also, if you had to remove 3 brawlers from the game right now, who would they be?
---
DONT BE CRYIN
---
Hey Kairos! I have a question about your opinions of crow and how he handles. I just got him a week ago. He is my first legendary brawler, and I want to use him a lot but I find him hard to get trophies with! Any way you can help? Thanks so much.
---
He may be 5th in damage but health and strat wise , hes like 22nd its all about strategy. 
---
who for help me in Maniac III ?

Join my club its right there

This is making me so frustrating, I guess 1k and 8k shd be in different pool right..? 
---
I have a lot of fun playing friendly showdowns with a bunch of friends, how do you have the most fun in Brawl Stars?
---
I didn't lol, f2p mini
---
^Can ^you ^say ^Banana ^at ^the ^beginning ^of ^your ^next ^video? ^Like, ^just ^say ^Banana, ^and ^then ^roll ^the ^intro ^after ^a ^2-3 ^second ^awkward ^silence?
---
^My ^YT ^acc ^is ^named ^Banana ^BOI, ^and ^my ^BrawlStars ^name ^is ^Banana ^written ^in ^yellow ^colour, ^that‚Äôs ^why
---
Yup
---
oh, what do you think would happen if i did buy mine?
---
Who is your famous brawler, skin, and which of them is the easiest to get to 500 trophies
---
How many trophies do you have. I‚Äôm at 7k. If you are 4k+ I want to help ya
---
I am really close to 12k and have a couple questions...
---
1. How can I add you as a friend? I had you added a few months back but you passed me and we‚Äôre not friends anymore... I‚Äôm at 11.9k now though and would LOVE to play with you and be your friend!
---
2. I am considering starting a YouTube channel for Brawl Stars. I understand it‚Äôs not as easy as it seems. What do you edit your videos with? And what equipment did you start out recording with? Did you start with audio and video? (I am on a low budget lol) Also when I start recording I have a hard time being myself and not bring weird, what are your recommendations?
---
*Play*
---
Would probably only unlock pam, and buying her it's not really realiable, she is probably one of the top 5 brawlers but not worth gems, you'll get her with time
---
Fact
---
I would love this feature so much! There are 2 reasons why Supercell hasn't done this though
---
1. It would be difficult to know which star power players have in-game
---
2. Rather than creating more Star Powers, they can use the time &amp; ideas it would take to do this in order to create more new brawlers
---
I'd love a way to customize the players' experience though. Granted, there are big perks to keeping the game simple on the surface
---
Did you get bored of BS beacuse there hasnt been any new features in a long time
---
H A T
---
ok. it sucks because if it had 2 different brawlers i would probably buy it but i guess i wont lol.
---
Whos your favorite brawler in terms of design, skins and general flavor? 
---
Legit me
---
Thicco

r/hsoooow 
---
Hi Kairos!
---
I am a F2P and just hit 8k
---
I have two legendaries and a mythic,
---
do you think it is worth it to save my boxes for Gene?
---
Haha you posted in the 1st 2 hours, so of course it got read!
---
Oh man... I don't even know. I've always been playing video games ever since I was very young. I don't remember what my first game was, but I do remember watching my brother play Final Fantasy 2 when I was really young. I watched him for hours lol
---
But Darryl is a robot 
---
MY GOD'S EXISTENCE IS UNDENIABLE 
---
Yeah because gacha game players are used to fucking awful monetization and lack of consumer respect. You kind of have to accept such treatment to play those games, so their standards are much lower 
---
Boss fight is the worst ticketed event. Boss going furious is just hotrible difficulty. They should nerf it, maybe remove the little bots spawning
---
Sorry, for don't publish a photo of the map
---
Sorry, for my bad English
---
Lol yeah, tbh I don't think buying any brawlers is really a good deal, unless it's a high rarity cheap offer
---
;)
---
O. M. God.. 
---
I never thought you would read I‚Äôm all ways invisible 
---
Because you already made billions with leon in the shop
---
The cocktails don't even burn like fire does, only the wizard barley skin and the barley ult burn, so he technically throws poison 
---
Fly, My pretties!
---
Hey Kairos!! Big fan, I messaged you in DM before.
---
I read that crow is being changed to mythic and gene is a legendary in this upcoming release of gene:( It's sad because I spent 549 gems last week unlocking a mythic then. Is there any chance players like me will be refunded?
---
I played her in Gem Grab and Brawl Ball. She was a lot more viable back when I did it though. If I were you, I'd wait to push her until you can find a really solid team to play with, or until the meta changes to make her more viable
---
She is pretty hot ngl.
---
They have said it is a strategy and they won't do nothing about it, get over it
---
So when are you buffing crow?
---
Oh my bad, thanks for pointing that out!
---
Thank you for doing this AMA. 
---
I have only 2 questions:
---
      1. I‚Äòm a big Spike Fan. Do you have any tips for me (gameplay, best mode)  pls?
---
      2. My favorite game mode is Heist. What‚Äòs yours and do you have any tips? (OK that‚Äôs now 3 questions üòÅ)
---
Greetings,
---
Sqquarre4321 
---
After the buff Morris is actually top tier, same sort of situation as Darrel. 
---
Yup Tencent is parent company of 80% of supercell 
---
Chinese controls majority of Finnish company
---
Fair point they r already taking in the moneyüòÇüòÇ
---
Congrats on 150k! :D. Can't wait to see the silver play button unboxing video! 
---
1) Which Mode did you play the most in order to get to 10k?
---
2) Will Darryl be the best brawler to play without his star Power?
---
3) KairosTime, KeirosTime or KairoTime?
---
4) I'm afraid to play ranked Matches because of teaming and because of having no friends online due to my timezone, can you suggest me any tips pls? (I am at 6k trophies)
---
I wish you all the best towards your journey to 1m subs! 
---
Thanks for taking your time to read this
---
See ya, 
---
Rafat
---
But the reward for it is like 2 years worth 
---
Cuz you get paired with people that have similarly ranked brawlers and most people with rank 20 brawlers are high in total trophies. 
---
1st, how often are you planning on coming out with character guides and brawlympics, 2nd, will you make a poco or Morris guide soon, and 3rd keep up the good work!
---
Amazeing idea lol
---
Learning how to move in unpredictable movement patterns is incredibly important. Also, learning to react quickly in order to juke is important. Utilizing bushes &amp; walls is essential. Keep your distance from enemy brawlers until you can find an opportunity to get close. Patience is key
---
Who do you feel is the most underpowered 3 brawlers, and how do you think they can be buffed?
---
thats not even the right angle
---
They temporarily reversed the matchmaking update to fix boss fight freezes
---
Haha not true . I used my rank 20 Pam for boss fight. And I got poco and crow teammate. The main point is tht poco is 7xx total trophies lol wif 4xx poco ..
---
Hey, I really like your content and it‚Äôs helped me a lot. I‚Äôve only started playing since global and have 3,700 trophies. I have a few questions about you or about tips.
---
1. Do you have tips for Tara? Tara used to be my highest ranked brawler at 320 trophies, but recently she‚Äôs dropped to 250 trophies. I know the basic stuff like be patient with her super and yada yada yada. All my other brawlers around 250-300 trophies are doing just fine. I really am struggling with her compared to other brawlers.
---
2. Where do you live? Straight forward question, I know you live in the states but what state? I‚Äôm just wondering.
---
3.  Will you ever play any other games on your channel? Brawl Stars is fun and all, but other games are great as well. Just wondering.
---
With mortis you have to escape and make fight the other, be passive with him. :D
---
I wonder if hes faster than crow 
---
I¬¥m ready  to buy this 50 dollars ! 
---
Thank you 
---
I think if u had crow he can stall enough to jump out or run not sure doe 
---
Yeah he doesn‚Äôt understand rng properly yet 
---
Idk what you mean, this is gold
---
His Super charges quite slowly and his damage output is not enough, but I get what you mean ^^
---
Boss went Sicko mode
---
Thanks! Love you‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
This meme format can be used in so many ways
---
It isn't though. I need Leon and Crow but the offer I got today is just for Crow. I think it's either luck based or the devs don't want to offer a dual package with Leon in it considering everyone goes to buy Leon when the offer pops up in the shop.
---
Believe it or not it's called RNG and it's in every loot box ur friend at 6k got unlucky and your other one was lucky.
---
Love this drawing 
---
so much fear 
---
I've posted something about that already
---
yES
---
Omg kairos actually said hi to me :o
---
I have been blessed... does that make sense in this scenario?
---
Thanks so much for your support!
---
1. I try to have a limit on the amount of hours I work so I can spend time with my family. I love the work so I haven't felt the need to take breaks. The schedule is pretty random right now as it's greatly based on if Lady Kairos needs help with our colicky newborn
---
2. Clash Royale requires less than 100 interactions in the duration of a match because the AI takes care of everything for you. Brawl Stars takes millions in a single match (every movement, every tap, for every player). They're still working to optimize it, but it's a lot more complex
---
3. My backup plan was to go back to school if things didn't work out. I have until June to tell the head of my department if I'm coming back or not. The fact that I had time, and the savings to give this a good solid chance is how I dealt with it. Honestly, I was really struggling emotionally leading up to the decision because I was chasing 2 impossible dreams with split effort. Once I made the decision, my emotional state became WAY better!
---
I've Posted something about that already
---
Yeah me 2. The snow game was the best.
---
I already own Leon though
---
Removed - You have a negative karma score, please fix this before posting again. This action is to prevent spam on the subreddit.
---
Because they can't force you to aim and fire... And because the game doesn't reward kills it rewards survival.
---
I think he needs one. He's a tricky one to balance. It seems he either becomes incredibly OP or very under-powered. Finding that sweet middle-spot is hard due to his mechanics
---
That didn‚Äôt stop me from raging lol. But thanks for the info. I just hope Leon appears in the shop soon
---
Ahahaha nice one but you forgoten the backround 
---
So now you contradicting yourself/being hypocritical? I thought you wanted the mature route, now your just acting childish. You said you were gunna leave. Haha so what you mad bro?
---
That's exactly what I am doing. Lol.
---
Hey Kairos! I know it‚Äôs been past two hours... 
---
Well anyway, I got the game day 1 of global launch. Currently at 6700 trophies. Only have 16/22 brawlers. No legendary, mythic, and Pam. How can I get more brawlers faster? Other than gemming (I‚Äôm f2p) and getting the daily tokens?
---
Not worth spending money on
---
How it feels to become famous?
---
Lucky man, token doubler overpowered
---
Thank you. You can see the other paintings on Instagram.

I can‚Äôt even beat Insane 1 with my Power 8 Pam + randoms. So hard, too many missiles non stop.
---
I'm sry
---
This looks like it‚Äôs out of a coloring book lol
---
I mean it is a Supercell Game
---
How do you watch replays? Haven't seen any in-game option for that
---
I have all brawlers but Leon but I've been playing for a long ass time 
---
no the boss will charge there is not longer a spot where you can create that scenario. Map has changed
---
I think the DOT is pretty powerful. Given that he's the only brawler with it.... Just don't think he needs it. I usually mop up with crow. 
---
becuase the Luna Event ends on the 14th 
---
A normal day in OG.Qazvin
---
Trying to show off?
---
But possible
---
I‚Äôm trying to be mature by helping you be mature by saying just leave it at that. Also that last line was childish.
---
Supercell have no mercy. Jk lol
---
But you have the Leon flair...
---
~~As a Leon main, she's one of the more annoying operators to play against...~~  
---
She has high health and range, and her gun chips at HP from afar. Trying to rush her will just get you mowed down.  
---
Her super puts down a healing station that gives much needed HP, and her star power gives HP to nearby teammates when she attacks.  
---
All in all, she's a decent supporting brawler that can hold her own, or lead pushes as a tank. So if that's your playing style, you should pick her up.
---
My biggest advice would be to recognize that you'll never reach any dream you're not willing to work very hard for. I worked incredibly hard to graduate college and get into my doctorate program. Even though I dropped out from my program, it's not because I wasn't willing to work for it, I just found something else I enjoyed more that I had a great potential for success in.
---
I also think it's important to find a passion that you're willing to work for as well. If you want to turn your passion into a reality, you have to be willing to work ridiculously hard to make that happen. I spend countless hours for 2.5 years on YouTube before I ever got a paycheck that was financially worth the time I was spending on it. Up until that point, I was literally working at about $1-3/hour.
---
I don't say that to be discouraging, but rather to help you recognize that no matter what, hard work will be a requirement.
---
Ive been playibg since global. I have 2300 trophies and all i see is damned shellys and bulls and its really aggravating, they honestly take little to no skill! 
---
Oh yeah dont worry, in showdown I dont have to be first. I just have to survive and mortis is perfect for just running away
---
I give hearts based on original comments that make me smile, or that I think others will enjoy reading
---
I thought the life leech was good at discouraging teaming
---
Everyone has 2 in one offers while I have 1
---
K/D ratios would increase toxicity. While I like the star player idea, I would stay away from K/D ratios.
---
How do you think the problem of needing a team to be able to get even close to a decent trophy level should be addressed? Showdown is too luck based as of right now to be even close to competitively viable.
---
This was everything I needed. You are just salty. If they haven't changed it, they won't do it. Get over it and stop crying
---
What is this stage called ? Like insane 100?
---
Why are people upvoting? this was literally posted already!
---
;)))
---
awk that‚Äôs not bobs mini

I got to 4000 trophys

how is that opposite controls?

AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Is insane 3 the final stage?

ah fuck

Haha yes not being able to leave the spawn area to even try and get gems is very fun

I know, it was just for the Pamception.
---
Except that one time in duo showdown üëÄ
---
It's 3V1 he'd kill the jessie and won anyway.

Thanks

Did cost your soul like supercell sells their plushies for?

Pretty much same thing when uyou unlock a new brawler, I unlocked crow and 70% of players were bo's.
---
Not yet. I will when i get the chance today. 
---
U even made me double look, haha.
---
the OST is on youtube
---
Dude who cares
---
????
---
What?
---
Darryl, shelly and primo counter him super easily. And most other brawlers outrange him. The reason wht he feels so op is because you let him charge your super on you.
---
Who cares that he posted a Minecraft meme
---
Mortis just needs to be slower and darryl needs a slower super 
---
Mortis needs one more shot to get to brawlers most of the time so he cant be as power full and darryl will be easier to deal with since you can react well
---
does he shoot lazers? Oh gosh that would do like 3000 damage with like 100 lazers and the tightest formation.
---
Good idea thanks:)
---
Nice!!
---
Insane III
---
GOD MODE
---
Not randoms
---
Would be even cooler if they just made the champ u leveled points for that champ until level 9.
---
Yep, he needs more health or damage. He can't take a hit and it takes like 6 shots to break a box
---
Not that hard to kys in solo showdown
---
Don't buy them. Not worth it at all. Spend on Tickets (if you can do max time) or in Token Doublers. Plus, there is luck value, which makes the chances that you get sth on your next box greater every time you get nothing!
---
If legendary is to 1 tap someone then yes 
---
Please watch Legends of the Galactic heroes (the ovas) amazing show if you can get past the old art. Imagine if Light was actually a decent person

Complete opposite for me. My Wi-Fi connection is 5 times better than 4g speed but I'm constantly disconnected.

4g has a much better connection for me, but last couple days disconnection has been a bigger issue for me.
---
Why
---
I grew up playing Super Nintendo then Playstation. Lolz

An animated loading screen would just make the game take longer to load

Not a friend of mine

id like to be a mod; i have 500 mortis

He didn‚Äôt one hit you, he hit you, you rushed away he hit you again....

How long did each brawler take roughly?

Yesüëçüèª

Has anyone beat the insane mode yet???

God damn... I just hit level 69 and 5k trophies and I ain't got a legendary or any brawlers over power 7.
---
‚ÄúLevel 69‚Äù lol
---
I saw this reply coming

You stay back from the battle. Your super can be used to counter close ranged brawlers.
