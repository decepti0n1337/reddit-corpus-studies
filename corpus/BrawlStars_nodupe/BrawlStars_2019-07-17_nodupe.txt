Played since it first came out, but it‚Äôs still great now though, and they should bring back elixir for upgrading brawlers

This is literally just a repost.

Why are the people in this comments section so mad lol it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs hacking
---
Leon Invisihealth will heal 150 hp/s and as it lasts like 8s will heal 1.2k health per super which is not bad
---
[Oh, he wishes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/biptp9/the_cooler_nita/)

Heh

Wow, lost some respect after he says he‚Äôs against teaming and does it himself.
---
He's strollin on down to get that Shelly
---
That's iffy
---
**REAL SHAME!!** And to think Ash was someone me and my friend looked up too. The flair checks out tho lol, only i‚Äôm allowed to do that! Also found this mans rico in heist when my best mike skills were put to the test, but alas, should i really think myself under him in skill anymore?
---

To clarify, I‚Äôm played both matches with Shelly, and the last match brought me up to 400 trophies with her. In my match history, I can replay some matches but not others. T seems random
---
It only heals 1k, healing is *nerfed* in big game.

And also why is it a video?

This is actually a good idea

I have no idea why the comments are locked in the other post, I didn‚Äôt do it :( I think it could have been a moderator. Just so you know I wasn‚Äôt trying to get people mad at ash or anything just wanted to post a replay, Ash is still a great player

Play solo showdown is easier, so that is only beneficial on 3v3 modes, since randoms are usually degenerates

i dont get it, is it bad or good
---
thats some great work

Oh shit
---
And that's exactly what Supercell doesn't want. The point of this offer was trying to sell both things, and they won't change it. They will release a legendary offer again in the future, but this post is just useless

How it works basically is if there is someone in the match who has 400 trophies you can view the replay even if you don‚Äôt have 400 trophies on the brawler your playing with and the last match someone had 400 trophies so you‚Äôre able to view the replay but the other replay no-one had 400 trophies so you can‚Äôt review the replay.
---
And with this we can conclude this thread is a meme
---
Not really, I don‚Äôt get angry that I pushed piper and then the whole trophy system got revamped, its easier for other plays too, now, which is fine but it IS more time &gt; skill now.
---
Also glad you recognize me :) thanks!

Add me let‚Äôs see my name is p¬∞¬∞p¬∞¬∞, the weird characters in my name are zero thingies, if you hold down 0 it should add another option
---
I miss you old friend
---
nice
---
There must be brawler with 400 trophies or above for replay to be available. In the match below there were plenty of people with 400 trophies which is why there‚Äôs reply unlocked for it. However in the match above there are no brawlers who are at/above 400 trophies. Therefore, there‚Äôs no replay for that match.

And then, the discovery their friend was playing for them and they actually suck.

This may have happened to one of my friends but idk, I'm better than most of my friends (except one or two who are almost identical in skill) and I play for them sometimes

His huge range and spread is his biggest strength he can control opponents well but if you aren‚Äôt good with him/ get overwhelmed he can‚Äôt do much as his damage when dealing someone running in a straight line is not insanely good.

Only healing 1260 every 20 seconds

Maybe I was 3th when he first came out but then his super did damage in solo keep range and chip back then not but now definitely in team fight you have to create opportunities like in duo pull a leon if ur teamate is shelly with super but mostly defend and in gem grab keep your super for the one with the gems hope this helps

well yes but actually gene is bad in bounty due to his low damage

I play almost only 2v2 with randoms, and I play the brawler I want and I have something like 70-80% winrate (2nd or 1st position). I have half brawlers at 500+, and while I agree that randoms are trash most of the time, if you aren't trash it means statistically that they have max 3 bad players and you can have max 2 in your team. If this doesn't fit you, it means that you're trash too (sorry).

There will be 2 different brawlers, but Barley's super was rather penalized compared to the times when 2 puddles can clearly hit opponents, so why this difference?

Interesting, using a brawler that can't hurt you to your benefit, very interestig. But can this be called "team"? I think not.

Hahhahhahaha rosa op pls nerf hahahahhaha

Yes!

Honestly though 8.852917472/10

Good but make the spawn point for the brawlers in the corner closer. Will take much longer to reach the middle, putting them at a disadvantage.

I just reposted it

No. The main attack that increases in damage the super damage that doesn't. I think damage for him will suit him best for most situations. He will became even stronger in heist and siege. As a barley you have almost always a wall protecting yourself anyway but I think both are very good for him. I am disapointed with the frank's one I thought would be equal mortis' one I think would be very agressive one. Run in and get a kill and them.super get a kill continue on the fight and keep pressure for a long time. A straight 1000 hp doesnt sound too fun maybe it will be good but it is just a meh SP
---
Not the art. The act of stealing art is horrible.
---

What... why would 90% of people be against it? Just because of the idea of a battlepass is played out?  A battle pass would LOSE Supercell money. Because they would be giving away content way too cheap. Unless they did it different than everyone else doing a battlepass.   
---
The basic battlepass structure is $10 and gives you enough currency to buy the next one if you complete it. One 300 gem skin would cost you more than a battle pass that would last you forever.     
---
If you are a FTP player, you should absolutely be in favor of a battle pass because battlepasses are the best value given for a small amount of money.
---
thought it was Y
---
F for the hoomans.
---
I need you in my team desperately
---
Also give me the copy post I wanna down vote it I hate stealers
---
The indestructible wall act like map boundaries.
---
then give credit to the one who posted it first
---
Except he did it for real so many times. Credit where credit is due.
---
yeah i didnt see him 8n the drawing. thats sad, but at least he did a fantastic job on crow and leon
---
Get out
---
Actually i feel that about kairos
---
Training cave videos, full videos on some random game if you watch his old content you can see his hard work and dedication but now i feel like he is doing it for money only(i am not saying he shouldn't be earning money but quality shouldn't be compromised) 
---
Rey's contents are awesome recently (just my opinion no one has to be agree with me)
---
i only want Season pass can be brought with gems
---
Free players can buy the pass once every 3/4 months saving (that would be fair)
---
players with a better financial situation can buy monthly
---
all I wanted was for a part of the community don't be excluded
---
I am the one who posted it first
---
Oops

---
why you post it 4 times
---
So? There are plenty of silly Showdown videos posted regularly, does anyone say 'oh but what about all the times you didn't win in showdown?'
---
No, they don't. They give kudos because it's cool.
---
I'm sad
---
I just wanted the pass to be bought with gems instead of real money
---
do you have proof?
---
Wait what? That is the system we have now... A battle pass would be basically free skins for life for the one time small purchase of ~$10 that you also could just save up gems for. Instead of $20 for one singular skin. Realistically what FTP player is saving up 150-300 gems for a skin every month. But you could save up 170 gems for a battle pass then roll that over for literally the whole lifetime you play....     
---
I think you either don't understand the concept or ramifications of a battle pass and how they are implemented in other games. Or you are one of those "game companies don't deserve 1 dime from me for a FTP game".

I can‚Äôt tell if this is sarcasm

I've started Brawl Stars since December 2018; I spent like 60‚Ç¨ on it and I have an almost maxed account (I have all brawlers, I got lucky to find Leon and Spike the same day in little brawl boxes 2 days ago): I have all points for every Brawler minus Leon and Spike; I'm only missing Gold for upgrading the last 10 and some Star Abilities.  
---
I don't think this game is too hard to complete, I've been playing most of my games alone or with my cousin, he's sitting at 7000 trophies with 2 legendaries, and all brawlers except Tara, Gene, Spike and Frank. He's a F2P player as he doesn't like to spend money on mobile games, but he started like one month before me.  
---
From my experience, 2 things to point out:  
---
1. If you spend a little amount of money, you really get more and more far. 10‚Ç¨ for an Epic brawler means at least 400 more trophies; if you use your gems (the ones you found in boxes, not the one you get for paying) properly, buy double coins. 50 coins are equal to 10 fast boxes which will lead to finding more tickets, more double coins and other gems. I think this game helps you a lot even with few bucks, unlike CoC (dunno how it works now, but when I played it with 10‚Ç¨ you couldn't even afford half level of a queen at T9).  
---
2. If you don't like to pay just like my cousin, keep in mind that this game is financed exclusive by the ones like me who spent 60‚Ç¨ which is the equivalent of a triple A game for PS4. Now I want to talk about this: you're getting an amazing game (let's be real here, no games offers such fun for fucking 0‚Ç¨), and sorry if I'm getting a little be rude here, but you being a player doesn't mean you can judge everything about the game. You can be harsh with X brawler being broken and such, but you can't say: "if they add season pass I'll quit because it's stupid"; you did nothing from Supercell, and they did nothing to you. Whatever their decision is, you're not a consumer if you're not spending a single cent to a game you're playing dozen of hours in. I like to speed up progress with a good amount of money, 60‚Ç¨ as I said, because when I bought Red Dead Redemption 2 for 60‚Ç¨ I got more than 200 hours of gaming which are a really good price for my own fun. Brawl Stars is no different in this, I spent almost 300 hours in this game and if I pay 60‚Ç¨ it's also a big thank you to Supercell because they made a really good and fun game for my personal prefetences.  
---
The game offers a lot and it's free for most of the community, if you stop to play because you don't like something they adds such as Battle pass, it's fine: but don't think that you'll do some damages because there are no fucking ADS in the game, and you are worth 0‚Ç¨ for them (and no, if F2P mass quits, the game will still be playable because they make tons of money from other people and they are the ones that keeps this going on).
---
What is it a tease?
---
Don't mean to be picky but how do you know this is it on his profile
---
I know he needs nerf more than mortis needs buff
---
It was a random cue
---
I think that's better then recive amount of gold and pp. Also I don't think this sp is so bad
---
How is it hurting me?
---
Why not?
---
Me trying to get the old siege tokens with randoms be like
---
90%? Where did you get this from?
---

---
I‚Äôve gotten 45:0, not the highest but I believe the highest someone got was 52:0

So what ur saying is its dumb and hurting me just because it op?
---
#ZerO dEaThS

Really? If they make a battle pass like CR I will totally buy it! I find it really cool!
---
If Ricochet sees this He would say: I got the right gf

Nobody said that about keon and rosa on release. Whats wrong this this starpower. Its just good
---
Is this your Instagram page? Because if yes, you stole this
---

---
What if he really like sd? U can put faster there with suitable strategy
---
Imagine being a lil bird that some reason is very rare and not very unlockable until probably 12k trophies in average that just shoot knives that barely deal damage and that Piper,Bull,Primo,Darryl and Rosa can kill with one 1 and Shelly with 2 power ups can also one shot a Crow so shush Crowgang ur just a black lost bird
---
Hi, am I the first one to see this or...?
---
I never see this all 3 player got 7 stars and this is not a fake :)

I‚Äôm not against it... I guess I‚Äôm 1/10!

Its not unpopular opinion its just the truth

---
Don't worry about it. u/Denkazzor has 1 karma. Only 1. Let's make it zero.
---
Oh yeah it‚Äôs big brain time
---
He just start to play crow, he is learning how to play him, so...
---
Where in the god damn fuck did you get that statistic?
---
How exactly does the sp work ?
---
he can, it's just a joke.
---
Yeah I know but I had a lot of start power available to get and that one was the worst lol üòÇ
---
It‚Äôs whatever, I mean I just thought that one troll had opened the flood gates and tbh when you‚Äôre 12 stupid shit hurts for no reason. Dumb ass comments like that could make him hate drawing so he stops and then that‚Äôs a loss of him and things he could have done in the future. Adults can take pretty much whatever but kids or teens younger then 14 take shit to heart cuz they don‚Äôt know no better.
---
I think that it‚Äôs better if it‚Äôs only pay with real money... brawl stars has to make a money somehow and if they do it with gems it won‚Äôt be as good. If they do it for $5 a season I would totally do it (at least for the first couple)
---
U still have to think when is the time to backstab cause i dont see any reason for backstab and tilt
---
Thx for calling me the superior *i have NO lag*

Me too

Wtf would anyone be afraid of a blue mecha crow ?

Gives you 1000 more max health
---
That‚Äôs it

Except that its tag has 7 digits... So it isn't a new account
---
Dude, stop lying. You are denying everything they said, and you don't give any extra information. It is clear it is fake and just an useless attempt to get karma
---
Yed
---
Actually it‚Äôs a pretty solid star power. It‚Äôs not great but 1000 extra health is not something to ignore
---
Dont worry i will save u from karma vote just because of unpopular opinion
---
I swear to God if I every open brawl stars and I see Ryan's cute face telling me that I'm able to purchase a battle pass. I will only play El primo and super into bulls as gem carry. This is a warning u/supercell_ryan.

Just wanted to point it out. People spam buff mortis everywhere, but he is good the way he is. He can counter almost every brawler below 4500 health if used correctly.

The first picture is honestly me

In the last 30 days I‚Äôve gotten spike bibi Leon tick gene and mortis

Goddamnit

Cry a little

As a mortis main I can agree with this. However it does require his super.

Bull with 30 power cubes (somehow):
---
OJ needs to sit down by himself, not in front of the camera, in complete silence, and just play the game for like 10 hours. He tries to fill every second of his videos with dialogue and it distracts him from making smart choices. He overanalyzes unimportant things and reads situations wrong. If he‚Äôs going to get better at the game then it‚Äôs by practicing, not filming.
---
Also, the pace of Brawl Stars is so much faster than Clash Royale‚Äî you can‚Äôt comment on everything that‚Äôs going on. Yet he still tries.
---
I think OJ needs to do videos about how to play brawlers and good mechanics. When a new card came out in Clash Royale, he was always my go-to to find out how the card fares against every other card.
---
A final note: when KairosTime polled his viewers on their trophy counts, like 30% were over 10k (as opposed to the 0.2% of the player base that was &gt;10k at the time). High level players don‚Äôt wanna watch you push your low rank brawlers OJ! They want advice and analysis, not gameplay and commentary.

---
If only I had crow instead of spike...
---
See now I‚Äôm definitely fine with that (wish I had Mortis players like you in my games haha)
---
But far too many times in my games, I find my Mortis should casually staying in the back, not attacking at all, until for example, the enemy gets the 10 gems, which is easy for the enemy to do since it‚Äôs basically a 2v3, and then that Mortis just ends up giving the opponent all the gems, making it impossible for a comeback to work. It‚Äôs annoying how common this is
---
Ur account makes me sad. It is SO underrated! I LOVE every single drawing of you!

R/subsithoughtifellfor

Depends how many gems you are given in trophy road, if you get a lot of gems this would make spenders of the game upset since they so what wasted money so in my opinion I don‚Äôt think this would be a good idea however if it‚Äôs a low amount then it‚Äôs okay.

Chill he/she put alot of hard work on this do u have any idea how hard 3d modeling Is?!?

You should use your long range advantage more often
---
Who are these people? Where do they come from?

"Sow" fair. Just different power level around the same amount of trophies. And learn to spell before you complain about that
---
Can confirm, I'm going
---
But here dyna has 198k hp and not 18.2k ü§î
---
"Sow"

Dude I‚Äôm twelve and that‚Äôs SICK!!!!

*laughs in Sup√¶rCell*

Looks great but hair color is off

Well um... he does need one just a tiny reload speed buff well for Poco and Mortis just a tiny bit and NO not 1% but maybe ehhh I don‚Äôt know either 3-4 percent it‚Äôs just a tiny bit
---
He said unusable on some maps. Which is half true because he can be used but he's so easy to counter
---
bro I have a bad skin idea they‚Äôll never add, I‚Äôm saying this as a joke, but it‚Äôs called Night Witch Mortis, it‚Äôs gonna be from clash royale, but they‚Äôd never do that lol
---
and what does that shit have to to with me being unoriginal lmfao

The dynamike are just dumb, just aim in front of themselves.  They probably auto aimed
---
It‚Äôs honest work
---
In that server, training cave is Big Game and he became the big brawler there
---
Basically supercell telling you to uh...get off their game and do other things lol
---
repost
---
Damn really?
---
Don't team on showdown serious . Pro tips (15k)
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that bad. The absolute trophy ranges don‚Äôt matter; all that matters is that there is a range/threshold where the win:loss ratio is 1:1. Who cares if it is at 300, 500, 700, etc; I certainly don‚Äôt.
---
oxi mano, q q eh isso
---
already seen, you stole this meme -_-
---
More bugs with El Primo..
---
Don't main anyone too much! It's always good to play every brawler equally and not always rely on a single brawler. I see a person said to not play showdown but it doesn't really matter what you play, as long as you don't team and stuff, just try to get better. With that said, welcome to brawl stars!
---
That crow could have used his super and had a chance to kill Bibi in a blow... But he didn't.. just don't know why
---
de erro

nao eta pra isso acontecer

eu escrevi algo s√©rio e isso apareceu

 Ol√° supercell, gostaria de falar sobre um assunto que vem me incomodando cada vez mais, o balanceamento do jogo. Nesses dias eu alcancei a classe 20 com minha shelly, e hoje, tenho ela n√≠vel 7. E um probleminha vem ocorrendo, eu estou caindo em combates contra pessoas n√≠vel 10 (com poder estrela) e isso √© muito injusto! Portanto gostaria que voc√™s da equipe da supercell arrumassem isso e mudasse o tipo de balanceamento. por exemplo: voc√™ jogar contra pessoas com 1 n√≠vel a mais ou 1 n√≠vel a menos

      Obrigado,

For a second I thought it was just bots, since their programming with Dynamike is just awful.
---
Then I realised it was an actual person. Instant shaking of my head.
---
Love your work, carry on dude!
---
He's literally that kid who just discovered youtube and went to complain about not having a legendary at 453 trophies.
---
It's because people wont suspect theft. Reverse psychology
---
Remember, this is against the rules.
---
Elle est super belle
---
You literally made an account just for this...
---
Pathetic
---
Yo no way.... my name is Brawl Boi in game lol
---
I really feel like you did not need to explain it
---
I‚Äôm 8k but okay. But even if I was 6k would it matter?

u/brawlboi57 u/srgrafo

Ah yes. Accuse someone you disagree with of being bad at the game. Classic.
---
This is stolen content.
---
Because your being a little uh...asshole

Carefully, he's a hero

My name is YeetusDeletus üòâ
---
I would just go to his club and report him there
---
please do every other rarity
---
I hate how it hides his half body behind walls.
---
Can't you guys see that the person named u/brawlboi made this! Why are you guys upvoting a stolen post!!
---
TOP HAT MORTIS is my favorite

What does trophies have to do with being an asshole? One could be really high and be an ass, or one can be really low and be a nice person.

Keep it going
---
I didn't auto-aim tho...
---
carl should have been named carmine
---
Can I eat it
---
Outside?! But, but... I don‚Äôt wanna go outside!
---
Nice
---
It could only be found in 8 months ago (gene update)
---
No worries! If I ever revisit this model, I'll definitely make sure her hair/the lighting better reflects her true color. I wanted to go for more of a sinister Bibi with a dash of crazy in the second pic just to try out some different things. :)
---
but the bull is too stupid to leave his bush and get seen so he just sits there and eats the bullets
---
Why would it only have two x's
---
üòå
---
It's a game, calm down, I was hoping they'd learn how to aim. I was teaching them, I could have just killed them instantly would that have made you happy? Geez take a chill pill
---
Being at 6k a joke for basically worse at the game then they think they are. So this might fit as a whoosh but i don't do that
---
THATLL TEACH YA
---
Bruh you are crazy bro 
---
I do not know if you played the beta but this map is the death Absolut that teams it was really not crazy
