I'm an f2p at 6.2k and I've never seen a gem pop up in a box...
---
---
---
i love it
---
oh im sorry
---
Well I‚Äôm gonna buy the new brawler, and just need 4 starpowers. So I just get those when they come out in shop. All the boxes will help me get a power 9 new brawler right when they come out. Possibly power 10.
---

---
So just you know, code for that? Really the phone should be doing the heavy lifting in terms of time zone. You just pull the phone time and check if it‚Äôs within whatever you consider to be night. If people want to get cheeky and change their phone time to change a background, who cares.
---
Dude that Shelly was terrible
---
Every freaking game in every mode im at 17+k.
---
Translate:
---
Dear SUPERSELL, map Cavern Churn is like created for campers: Bull, Rosa, El Primo. Play on this map with other brawlers is too dificult. Please delete this map from the game.
---
yeet
---
And when I did get a gift card which is technically f2p as it was a gift, I bought some gems, but I couldn't resist, I'm not gonna waste a year collecting 700 gems for TWO legendaries (the only brawlers I need to unlock)
---
Wait that‚Äôs illegal
---
Uhmm, Tara but before the inflation
---
there are thing called discount and it took me 'only' 5 month to get 400 so i bet 700 won't take a year
---
And I know it's possible to get gems but the only thing I get is token doublers..
---
I have over 67k
---
I am coming to your house now...
---
I seriously wonder why people share these stuff,
---

---
"I got my first rank 20 brawler"
---
"600 Mortis let's go"
---
"I reached 14k"
---
Wtf? it's not an accomplishment anymore, maybe get your brawler to 1k and then share it because 600 is like the standard rn
---
He was queued up with the shelly, so there is no other way that that match would have happened. Frank from supercell has said many MANY times. It‚Äôs not a matchmaking problem, it‚Äôs a problem with player understanding of the matchmaking system.
---
Lol he still trash

Love your art as always
---
And with the discount it's still like 599
---
+20 helmets 54m 20s
---
Did you know even at 500+ people still see red and dive ticks?
---
They didn‚Äôt do this to avoid trash talk
---
The problem with dyna at close range , his shots are very easy to evade
---
You‚Äôll get one before 1k trophies. My tip is to not play too much when you have used up all of your tokens
---
Your robo rumble and big brawler records are inhuman

Give shelly with band-aid an eye mask and replace Leon

How do I get these Shaders?

Had a Shelly that charged (walking straight btw) into Piper and Brock in bounty. When that painful game was over I got queued up with the same person

Omg lol, hey east
---
Proof?
---
U didn't either lol
---
Eh for players who have more time just buy token doubler ;p
---
This is basically daily deals
---
Skin is awful but I use it cause of that nice effect on a super hit
---
Yes I didn't
---
If u use it for few days, You'll get used to the face
---
dyna-jump will be pretty broken on this map lol
---
Yeah don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs normal not to get any brawler from a big box or even a mega box. Each box has like a 2%+ chance to drop a rare brawler, so it‚Äôs not that hard to get it compared to mythics or legendaries
---
Tbh I try to tune it out. Doesn‚Äôt look too bad from the top though so worth it imo
---
Also, Clash royale had a trophy inflation too
---
Lmao
---
I know he‚Äôs the one I use

He's 5 and he draws 5 times better than me lol
---
Return Of The King
---
Not really, (I don‚Äôt want to brag or anything) but usually I can carry if there is one bad teammate

This isn‚Äôt even impressive

Well what if that teammate is a self goaler
---
True

Good for a 5 year old

Pfffft. That's pinky spike mate

I had a couple of skin ideas similar to this I haven't gotten around to making:
---
Sleepy Gene, the lamp becomes a teddy bear, and he's wearing star pajamas with a nightcap. 
---
And Pillow Fight Penny. She and her mortar fire pillows.
---
This is by far the best
---
Ayyyy
---
talk is brawl when?
---
He did not put OG Mortis's hat, so he is not included in this. And I use mods so I can play as OG mortis. So this post does not apply to me.
---
What mode?
---
Underrated!
---
Level 8 bull before the throphy inflation.
---

---
Leons a weak peice of "homosapien" molecules and enzymes
---
Thanks :/
---
I have Leon dumbass. #JG22CL2 is my gametag, look it up and find my brawlers.
---
Anyways, no one cares. These posts are low effort and annoying. The only reason I still follow this subreddit is for 1/100 posts that have insightful strategy. Everyone posts terrible art, cringy art, or terrible memes, cringy memes, or this terrible shit.
---
Bull should have tried to get his super and save them
---
That's just green bo
---
This mortis was not wearing the OG mortis's hat.

In my opinion, there is no fix to seige. It will always be either too risky or unfair.

PLZ SUPERCELL HIRE GEDI KOR AND PUT HIS HOCKEY MORTIS SKIN IN THE GAME!!!! PLZZZZ HIS SKINS ARE THE BEST!
---
Your wrong legendaries are not rare but legend rare
---
What are you talking about? I‚Äôm clearly a pro player gifted with immeasurable talent. The only reason why I lost is because I‚Äôm humble and generously gave the win to the other team to make themselves look good

---
Piper angel
---
Keep it up u can reach 700 like me
---
Just aim the attack to the bush while walking into it, make sure there are no walls affecting the knockback, then you just gain the upper hand
---
A token double may be worth 10 brawl boxes, but you'll actaully get 20 boxes from it. Doublers are the right choice.
---
Muy caliente for me.

Another good skin idea but cracker Rico

It's actually not. I've never heard of him...

If you use any Brawl Star app that has been modified by others, then it's possible that your account has been banned for violating Supercell's ToS.

Best skin u ever made

When someone does that to me and we're team again in the next game I fire at it until we both got dead
---
Doink!
---
and milked em for all their worth.
---
This isn't yours
---
Who says Rico suck. He very good
---
Wait, it has turned 9 weeks already? I just found it out yesterday and thought that it only changed for days,anyway, i think it looked too dark
---
is it me or do i think that people rather want gems and stuff in brawl stars?
---
Yup
---
This could easily be added to the game
---
Great skin
---
Spike is üò¢so real great work friend
---
No
---
Is the game any fun at that point anymore? Season reset must feel lovely.
---
Can relate
---
Actually, we're the slaves for their entertainment. I mean we are already bored for a more than a month without new content(except star powers which only people with much money can have it immediately). We need new update for f2p, we need new brawlers and skins for p2p, to put it simply, we need brawl talk soon. And supercell are just watching us suffering. No hints or anything, no date information whatsoever. And we're paying with money and playtime. So yeah we're the slaves.
---
He spent more money last week than you.
---
At least better than my little bro, he is also 5 but he drew primo with ten gems and using his super
---
It was nice, but the limited skins in the shop create scarcity. It adds perceived value. If you know you can buy any of them whenever you want you're more likely to put it off and not purchase. It's good marketing.
---
I like cavern churn. Eye of the storm needs to go though.
---
I feel you. It's not easy. Congratzz.
---
Off topic, my friend.
---
you made me an enemy of you
---
When crow uses his super, the poison daggers do not actually spawn from the centre of crow, but rather a small radius around him. For direct hits on brawlers with small hit-boxes (such as gene) a perfect hit will actually have all the daggers miss because they spawn around the brawler. 
---
Against larger hitboxes (such as the heist safe) a perfect hit will still connect with all the daggers, dealing massive damage
---
wtf it's the same menu !!! xD
---
ikr
---
Yeah but at least it would be cool to see those skins an only sometimes with the ability to buy them just like the shop rn
---
You bot it‚Äôs with bots
---
Its just something i found in pvz that mortis needs
---
a big puffy red NO FUN buttom would be nice
---
Sometimes i agree but often it's others
---
It‚Äôs on iOS for me, though if it‚Äôs alpha may be region released.
---
That said he‚Äôs not lying one of the promotional picture has the exact same main menu picture.
---
Add some group events. Some Skill challenges.
---
And Poco should be Negative because he has a hole where his nose should be.
---
I changed it happy now?
---
I do the same every time I Reach 1000 trophies. Every time I draw a mega box.
---
I was cheking reddit horizontaly while it was vertical it was so weird to see this post
---
I just love it when I get close to piper and she floats away, then I proceed to yeet after her with el primo
---
Korega 
---
Requiem
---
Da.
---
That's Crow's beak. He only has nostrils
---
I had this game downloaded and played it a few times. Can confirm.

I think not the shop is cursed.  Your Photoshop is cursed
---
Even primo does badly in cavern churn.
---
Feels bad man

Brawl stars: you can copy but change it a little bit so it doesn't look copied

Very well done!
---
I got 2 legendary Brawlers in Mega Boxes in the trophy Road.
---
This looks like dynamike's jump scene before doing his hilbily dance..
---
Star Powers droping is very wierd , my first star power dropped after a month and one day but my second star power after 2 days . Star Power drop chance is twice bigger than epic brawler drop chance
---
They say that but in reality they are rare as a Legendary. I opened atleast 120 brawl boxes and got nothing. Idk what's up with the ods
---
Not really. The only problem I have with cavern churn is how op shelly is with band aid.
---
Holy shit this is a blatant ripoff
---
Ayee gg man! i too got 17k yesterday. Which gamemode was your primary one to push?
---
Nobody asked you if your were stupid or not. Guess you gave the answer anyway...
---
I used to play this exact game 3-4 years ago, to see this game, riping off the menu design of a much newer game in such shameless way is so disappointing and sad, as far as casual games franchises go, Fruit Ninja was among the best. Seeing it now copying something as close to the core of the game as the menu design from a much newer and completely different kind of game just because is successful is just sad.
---
HaHaHaHa 69 FuNnY
---
Yes there is. This dude didn't give you a good answer.
---
You can make some statistics, by doing a new account or watching someone make a new account (youtube).
---
But you have to know that on the supercell box descriptions, it's said that "early boxes are predetermined in order to have a fair chance for everybody", whatever that means.
---
I did my math with the boxes. I opened 800 boxes in total and in each box there are 23 gold and 15 PP on average. These stats don't change at the beginning of the game.
---
So I didn't find the system rigged, maybe you can find sth else, who knows ;)
---
Wow, how many more

Damn that was intense for such a level difference

WoW, lol, I'm misising Spike and Le√≥n yet üò∞. I wait that out when i open all the boxs....

Fucking trash
---
He DIDNT press play again. The problem is probably that the game matched him up with the Bo again three times

I‚Äôm missing the same 2. Almost at 500 with all the brawlers I have as well now like you; which ones will you push now?

No idea who exactly, but it's going to be someone who works on Brawl Stars that's for sure

 And they usually close frame batches each week, so probably sometime soon because this is the last batch

Look at me man the vacation ended in like 5 weeks or so
---
DAMN
---
The mega box thing doesn't work that way for fucks shake. 1 mega box= 10 regular boxes, when you open 10 boxes the chances of getting a leggie are getting 10x? So every 10 boxes your chance is getting 10 times bigger? Shut up you are humiliating yourself
---
Yeah man your right, for example: If you had a 1% chance of getting a legendary, would you be guaranteed to get a legendary after 100 boxes? NO. There would be a 50% chance of getting a legendary after 70 boxes. I learned this in middle school

I think adding more post flair options would be good. But also enforcing a rule that flairs are required on posts, especially correct ones. 
---
It could help users see what they want more quickly. 
---
If possible, even add flairs only mods can give. For example, if someone flairs ‚Äúhumor‚Äù but gains 1k upvotes and it is pretty funny, a mod can change it to a mod only flair like ‚Äústar humor‚Äù.

Sorry but I threw up seeing this

Me too. I also have bibi

Are you stupid?

Damn that's good

Well ok but spike should be kinda in good

Stop making so good
---
You are one of them too aren't you? I don't mind people who play only sd. But it's annoying when they push one brawler to 700 and then play 3v3 thinking they are too good.

Idea :using star tokens to buy star power

Frank is a brawler üòë

who asked for fruit ninja 2?

Yep and people with 4k trophies ruin matchmaking by pushing one brawler in sd and then playing in 3v3 thinking they are good.. I was just matched with a 780 trophy Jessie who had 6k trophies and she was worse than a bot

I made an IG acc before reddit. I loved his content and followed him. Then I made a reddit acc and today I realised this. What do I do?

Teaming

At least credit the artist

we did to have more people post this and credit tii ofc so they will make an action

what happend after this???

I think that there will be like little giveaways for certain themes. Like if Art is the theme you need to do brawl stars related Art And then from 1 of those will be picked And he will get like A brawl stars plush!

did it work

i hate when games do this it makes no sense and even if you arent doing bad you can always just tell you are going to lose the game even if your team has 10 gems because you can just tell that the game is rigged and you are bound to lose

I'm at 10k trophies and I only play it for the star token

by your previous post, i will assume this is stolen aswell

Brawl ball
---
I would give you a reward if I had one
---
Those tier lists are getting weirder and weirder....
---
Anybody can push a lvl 1 brawler especially after the trophy inflation. Pushing lvl 1 Leon is easy.
---
XD in emergency case, for example:
---
U can step on it or go to the Shelly with 20 power cubes, band aid, energy drink and super, what would u choose?
---
Like sakura spike?
---
Just searched it up. What I found was full garbage. 
---
Not suprised actually given all of clash of clans and clash royale rip offs
---
as much I hate people who steal content from reddit and post on ig, you can't really do anything about it. memes are meant to be spread and today you may report him, maybe get his account suspended, but tomorrow some other guy will do the same thing.
---
Fkin Instagram normies, these motherfucking everloving motherfucking mouthbrading inbred wafflestomping hell they are that deserve to get into a steaming fiery pit

Man, i have it too, in this acc i have gene crow and star shelly. 3740 my trophies.(sorry for my shit eanglish)
---
I posted it too if you check my profile
---
Imagine if this gets added and the final video shows bibi about to strike but in a fraction of a second (in one single frame) she will be revealed as mortis in diguise and then he turns back to look like bibi and then strikes
---
Took me like 10 minutes to make this hope you like
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a great deal. Bibi is currently one of the best in the game.
---
Just make sure when you check the bush you aren't pushing them at a wall, come from an angle where you would push them far enough away. Unless you think you can take them on.
---
I‚Äôm not doubting you or the video evidence looks real to me
---
So if i don't have 1000 star points i will have no background ?
---
any proof?

This is way too similar to a meme made during Season 3 of Fortnite to be a coincidence
---
Man I like eye of storm
---
This is so cute! This needs to be one of the skins this Halloween!
---
I get what you mean but the brawl stars menu is different enough to realise it wasn‚Äôt inspired by fortnite
---
Everyone teamed on every map

When his red bar is loaded.

When he will die now he will regen 30% of his life

Bunch of idiots

Nah, passage was better than both.
---
Sorry, Im new and didnt know there was a separate community for brawlstars clubs
---
good. but you're still missing my point - someone else is bound to do it again. and chances are they won't be as sweet as this guy

---
"Removes passage and adds cavern churn " really?!?
---
In my opinion passage was one of the worst maps in the game, but oh well
---
wait i recognize that style
---
If you read the entire thing, you would know it's per box
---
But cavern churn has even less variety than passage
---
Welp I don't have any legendaries yet
---
Hahahah funni someone used emojis tHaTS IlEGaL hahahha he deserves disrespect now ahhaha.
---
Seriously, you guys are mentally sick if you dont let people do what they want...so fucking disrespectful (and disgusting)

Nope she's too OP

I wish i can win really love this game i know it so long since 2017 but i couldn‚Äôt play back because it was not in my country..but since it got released it makes my day makes me happy and i hope i win.
---
Also supercell when or will you bring merchandise back? If so i really would love it!
---
I would buy poco i could sadly not get at least u got the legendary LOG üòÅ

THIS LOOKS SO EPICCCC!!!

There's no proof so eh

Angry birds never had that much ads when the game died they putted a lot of ads just to make some cash before its completely dies and look at subway surfers there are now soo many ads

Oh shit, i should have thought about it in this way üò¶ what have i done?
---
That's not how probability works you clown, it doesnt multiply like that
---
The more times you try, your chances dont go up, they stay the exact same, it's just that you are rollin it more times so you et more chances to pull a legendary
---
You aren't guaranteed to get a star power in 100 boxes because again probability doesnt multiply like that

With so many bulls in CC, how do they know who they teamed with??

Rlly? I never see anyone take a gander at it

It would be overdone and supercell just hopping on that trend which I don't want personally.

Wow another post about brawlers who have strange voices

Personally, I have two 600 brawler and Have yet to experience a mass teaming EVER I've seen few duos in solo showdown but nothing more than that
---
Tickers

Sadness

They've been lacking in years, time has taken it's toll on halfbrick

sike right now

Hello poco

The attack is ok but her super doesn't make sense... buildings? where in the match?

Wtf bandaid is not broken its very balanced

Carl is fine, but Colt is average at best, he‚Äôs so squishy so he gets deleted instantly by a bush camper.

Uum... It's violent a little (a lot), no? I'm talking about the Ebola virus

Waaay To Costly man. It Shpuld be 500 Each.

Oh... weird. Here have a suggestion for her super instead have her do a Frank stun but unlike Frank stun it only lasts 1 sec n the dmg is 800 per sec in radius of the quake which will last 5 sec
---
Ce plm e cu voi toti aici
---
Exactly
---
Could‚Äôve been good with some actually effort.
---
this is right above that post

Good point ill rework all my brawlers anyway soon so ill rename that

Haha you are the raging boy. Shouldn‚Äôt have overreacted
---
No :)2x xD
---
Stats:
---
Health:
---
3210
---
Damage:
---
Dino-bones:
---
Amber throws 4 dino bones per attack in a boomerang formation from left to right. She has a wide range like BiBi and the length of it is like Nita's. They deal 280 per bone.
---
Reload Time:
---
1.7sec
---
Super:
---
Trex Fossil:
---
Amber digs up the remains of a Trex which then comes to life and she's able to ride on it. The Trex can run at fast speeds and chomp on enemies dealing 870 per bite. Duration 4sec. When the time is over the bones explode dealing 310 damage.
---
Star Power:
---
Fossil Fuel:
---
Bones will be scattered across the map when picked up they give Amber a speed and damage boost(+250) for 2.5sec.
---
Second Star Power:
---
More Fossils!:
---
Ambers Super can now consist of 2 more living dino fossils. A Triceratops that deals 610 and can crash through objects. Or a Pterandadon that lets Amber soar through the air pecking down at enemies. Deals 720. Lastly the Mighty Trex. The duration is the same for all Dino Fossils. 4sec

Lol hadn't noticed it actually changed kkk

My  suggestion  it's simple: Polls.. Polls created by players or admins where the results are taken into a consideration for future updates. And a special section for clans (of course this goes hand in hand with an update for clan wars)
---
"I hope to win the T-shirt or the cap" &gt;.&lt;

wait how can u get 272 trophies while still having 20 tokens to get? FAKE

No...just no. I AM GETTING IMAGES AAAAAHHH

He‚Äôs not op. I think he‚Äôs fairly balanced considering you could just camp behind a wall.

I like it more as ghost spike

Yeah, that's my bad. I kind of tried something that didn't really work out.
---
Nawp
---
*now that's what I call a sin*

Damn bot
---
Your just a beggar begging for free stuff and content. It‚Äôs not easy for a small team of people to make a game and update it a lot. Cut them some slack.
---
henlo
---
wow you must have had a very bad day
---
Idk i haven't noticed that, maybe i got them as soon as i left the match. This could happen because you get the in batches of 20
---
H.C.D dude
---
Just amazing, bro
---
This is clearly traced, you just added shading. As someone who literally traces and shades things for digitization I can just map your image onto the profile icon for Crow and get an almost line for line match.
---
They should have removed both
---
Like sega did with clash royale
---
That could be like quest map like turet from siege play siege boss fight boss fight
---
15 of the top competive players disagree with that statement. 
---
She's an overall b tier.
---
B tier in heist, but only because of the tanks. Throwers and sharpshooter annihilate her. 
---
B tier in SD, because sharpshooters and throwers annihilate her. And the band aid sp regen time allows for people to to finish her off. 
---
B tier in smash and grab because she's too slow and fat to chase gem carriers
---
Brawl ball is actually her best mode with her at the top of a tier. 
---
Reason why Shelly isn't op is because it's not a tank meta and hse has no abilities to let her actually catch up to other brawlers.

It literally doesn't effect you or Supercell at all so why does anyone care?

They aren't losing money from it, neither are you.

Hey buddy it think you got the wrong flair
---
This map is exactly what I‚Äôve been dreaming of for brawl stars. And no one can complain about randoms when playing this game mode. Great idea üëå
---
It‚Äôs about Frank conforming it
---
Frank said on Twitter that they are not thinking about changing these ones
---
Pay 2 win, basically means the only way to actually have fun in the game is by spending a certain amount of money
---
They wrote about Frank confirming it.  Read ‚ÄúThe game developers later confirmed‚Äù

No ones talking about that amazing Shelly

Hola poco
---
Poco in one picture is power 8 and in another picture is power 9
---
epic sauce
---
What server is it
---
It's very good,respect! Next brawlers you can draw is Rosa frank Pam Piper and barley
---
Can we talk about your 54 unopened boxes?
---
I suggest a story mode or campaign mode with robot bosses or characters designed specifically for this mode. it can get more difficult as the player progresses through or as they power up brawlers. just and idea thanks bois
---
Maps that aren't in rotation should be in rotation, i'm bored of seeing the same map with the same modifiers every time
---
Looks kind of cute i like it pretty epic
---
No you didn't, otherwise you would have known that there are so many brawlers that do great, i pushed 600 total trophies in cavern churn, fyi i didn't play shelly, bull, primo and bibi not even once
---
So conclusion is that either you don't play showdown and love complaining or you suck at playing
---
Quick super charge? Hell no. That's only if you get insanely close. And while Band-Aid needs a nerf, a smart person would be able to avoid it.
---
Me toooo man
---
If you disect 3v3 to its smallest componets you'll understand that every player fights his own 1v1 all the time. The only difference is that in a 3v3 Mode players can switch lanes anytime in order to avoid unfavourable match ups. When making the map I thought that I as a player would love to hone my 1v1 skils and learn how to fight every different possible match up no matter how one sided it might seem. As a big 3v3 lover myself i needed to adapt to these difficult situations when they occured in game in order to help my team. What i learned? No fight is lost until you are send to the respawn room.
---
My Big Game time was made before the changes to this mode, when the big brawler didn‚Äôt lose health and when Nita‚Äôs bear was op af. My Robo Rumble time was made with the Primo glitch
---
My meme from a few months ago was stolen too.
---
How do I do the link?
---
That cause you team like a moron . Teaming is cancer and it ruins the whole point of the game. Honestly, any one who teams has more legendaries than IQ points.
---
mortis flairs: mortis is good, he just requires a lot of skilllll

also mortis flairs: buff mortis!!!!

Mabey some people like this map

---
In my next post you can find his apologies to redditors
---
Is it only me who realise that robo spike and robo Mike rhyme same with mecha crow and bo or am I dumb
---
He has to be right?
---
at least in cavern churn its possible to win as a brawler besides a close range. in eots, you literally cant walk two tiles without bumping into a bull in a bush
---
I'd hope so
---
The problem isn‚Äôt the recharge time. The problem is that, without warning, Shelly can go from nine hitpoints to 5040.
---
There are two solutions to this, that I can see.
---
- reduce Band-Aid‚Äôs effectiveness drastically (to 60% makes it so it can still technically restore Shelly to full health but realistically it leaves her at anywhere from 70-90%) 
---
- give it an indicator when ready. Bibi‚Äôs bat spins, Mortis‚Äô lantern changes color/axe glows/dice don‚Äôt change for some reason. I can‚Äôt really think of any aspect of Shelly that would look right if it were altered, so perhaps it would require Shelly‚Äôs model have a bandaid put on one shoulder and made invisible if she‚Äôs level 1-9, has Shell Shock, or Band-Aid isn‚Äôt ready
---
Personally I‚Äôd lean more towards the second. An effective extra 3k-5k hitpoints depending on the scenario plus burst healing without needing to stop attacking/being hit may be statistically OP and need to be toned down seperately, but being killed by a Band-Aid that you don‚Äôt know about or don‚Äôt know is charged is a whole lot more unfair than rushing Nita‚Äôs bear and taking double damage for a second until you run away because you didn‚Äôt know, or needing to deal an extra thousand damage to Bull because he turns out to have a shield. The same as close-range brawlers don‚Äôt approach Shelly with her super ready or else they die, they don‚Äôt want to approach her with Band-Aid, and only one of those has an indicator.
---
Piper x Mortis and Tara x Mortis is wayyyy better. These all exist. Even Mortis x Poco. Coltis is a big fat no no.
---
I actually laughed at something in this sub..... but i gotta address the elephant in the room, 6k boxes
---
Same,
---
I said why lol u didnt give a reason but it's okay I respect opinions
---
barley, tick, and dynamike are great as long as you stay out of the bushes. poco and nita also arent so bad. you usually get a ton of #2's, and even the occasional #1 if some of the bushes in the center are cleared or the other last persons another thrower.
---
Shit I didn't know this and I'm at 12800.
---
My disappointment... is immeasurable *slight robotic sob*
---
With coiled snake his skill ceiling is raised and his skill cap is lowered from needing advanced predictions
---
To be fair, the menu layout is *slightly* similar to fortnite, and definitely got inspiration (but we dont talk about that). But yes, Brawl Star's menu layout is very user-friendly.
---
You are so stupid you didn't even notice the "Do not steal" and did it anyways.
