I don't get it
---
---
---
Pls suscribe to my channel is _-slid3-_14
---
But I hope sc can rework that one and make it better rather than plainly just nore damage.
---
No hat, but you need a comb
---
You‚Äôre saying these thigs bc u dont have emz ... idiot
---
The new sonic remake is significantly better
---
Morper, as an alternative name, is the name of my nightmares.
---
Uhhh where‚Äôs that hand goin Kairos?
---
Leon and Nita are siblings canonically
---
Do yu now da wae
---
idk, I would save for token doublers.
---
El Taco
---
A rockability i see? I prefer the hat but i respect this amazing skin :)
---
True, this just makes it another way to get a guaranteed star power
---
Thanks for that. I'll be sure to do so.
---
I prefer how it is atm.
---
He is probably 10
---
Its just a friendly mode game and they knew that penny was going to put her turret there
---
I knew that
---
Broken
---
Also how do I get the Mortis icon on me like you have
---
Or you buy token doublers/tickets in offers or skins offers, if you like a lot a skin of 80 gems you can buy it, if its more it will cost you a lot of time and they are not that good
---
When i voted for brawl stars it said that it is in 5th place
---
_ok_
---
Happy cake day!
---
Hey isn't thaaaaaat bad... For a umh 6 years old? Umh
---
MY SLEEPY BOI
---
Cause if you have the plague at school they just say put some ice on it
---
Hi supercell. I create a idea for a new map of gem grab. But you like it!
---
wow, I still can't belive there are 3 throwers...
---
How you poco
---
I need one too
---
sksksksksksksksk
---
That‚Äôs why I always go away when the boss is invincible
---

---
F**k the noobs chasing everyone and caused low ranking for a few players and himself
---
I got crow leon and sandy frim regular boxes, spike i bought him with the robo skin pack.
---
Right now it is 5th
---
That‚Äôs why I find the invincibility for the bot useless, it promotes teaming and killing of players, which we all know we hate (unless we are the one killing others)
---
You finally unlocked all legendary, congrats
---
Same
---
Magi style with a brawl stars character ? Amazing!
---
I forgot how I get Leon, I think is brawl box, but I remember that I saved some box, then I open and got crow
---
Dang how high do you push your brawlers?
---
True
---
It's exactly what the other guy said. Bo adds an extra challenge to the enemy team, focusing on the mines. And now that he finally has star power that punishes more for not paying attention, your gonna go ranting that it's broken? And again, what the other guy said: He needed a star power for Non-Bush maps, and since you can't really choose between the two on any given map, the one your pretty much forced to use should be pretty good. Except it really isn't that good and you don't know how to NOT TOUCH THE MINES.
---
At least get it to rank 20.. geez.
---
This is EPIC. Do you GET joke?
---
And I swear, if you start another sentence with, SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT...
---

---
He needed a lil touch up.
---
Very nice, good job!
---
Just avoid the bushes whatever you do
---
Color pencils, my favorite!
---
Not very epic
---
Yesssss a man of culture I seeüëå
---
Ooh make a comic with Bull charging the boss then bouncing off as it shields ü•∫
---
You think they aren't TRYING TO FIX IT!? Do you how hard it is to design servers that can filter through millions of players just for your one little match!? Game design is extremely difficult!
---
Sentry down!
---
That's how I got Crow awhile back.
---
Honestly though!
---
When Brawl Stars come global? I'm still waiting
---
It's NNN bruh

Please tell me where you found this, or if it is just very high-grade art

Thx!

Look like he traced them, but they still look cool. Perhaps the letters could be better? Take an upvote

Good guess, but it's Max Payne 2. I suggest one song too- late goodbye

Im still waiting, but with all the content we have im good if i don't get one for the next 5 months

Meanwhile I can't hit a practice bot with Piper :(
---
This is amazing
---
Oh ya 100% crow‚Äôs annoying, especially with the double auto damage
---
Go to the main screen, click on the three dots, and then click on where it says something like change flair, or preview flair, and then choose whichever brawler you like :)
---
Piper would of been a more accurate position
---
r/lostredditors
---
How did you make your wifefu 3d
---
The Primo's that I play with usually pull a reverse card
---
Not much of an achievement? This is very high skill capped! Well done.
---
thanks
---
Im sorry but we need to arrest you for the mass homicide of rico's family
---
I can hear the sighs of the people on that primos team
---
Thank you so much ü•∞ü•∞
---
This would be a great brawler something new tho the 2nd starpower needs a bit of a rework but other than that bravo
---
Player killing is needed here. Players are added here for a reason. If it was everyone vs bot, than just make every player immune to each other.
---
Right now killing a player does 4 things:
---
1. Resets their powercubes;
---
2. Grants you some bonus powercubes;
---
3. Does not allow a player to deal damage to the boss;
---
4. Charges your super.
---
So if you see an easy kill, do it. It costs you nothing.

How to lose hope on brawl stars in 20 seconds
---
You're doing the work of g(m)od!!
---
I honestly dislike takedown but i still enjoy fanart. Now this perfectly captures how petty the game mode can become!
---
Everybody that‚Äôs sane
---
I hope you know this has already been posted. If you didnt, then it was. If you did, shame on you for not crediting the original creator, and dont expect to gain any karma from this.
---
Well I am in a group that my school made so I recomend that or join a group that has most people in your city.
---
2nd star power idea #2: her attack freeze water for 2 seconds, so the bodies of water in maps can briefly be crossed. 
---
We already have a super power for jumping over walls.
---
TIL: that sc liked the overused memes from this sub
---
No you haven't won yet, we're in 2fort with a score of 1:1, you wasted your crit on a sniper who melees everybody only to miss, **goes lucksman and taunt kill's**

I mean.. Sandy throws Sand. That's about all you pinpointed. I see what you're getting at, but this isn't defined as proof. Sorry lad. If it's the case, your contribution has gone unrecognized.
---
These all are just optional anyways and also the super thing was meant to be related with supercell like fortnite has the highest setting called epic cuz its made by epic games y'know
---
Vait vhat. **changes to scout and GOTTA GO FUQIN FAST**

You have read me mind.

No no ping is related with wifi &amp; fps is related with your phone (frames per second)

i can for sure say duo indicator improvement ideas arent a new thing and a lot have been made by various dates, its a populat concept to an extent so it could just be coincidental
---
*Alabama theme intensifies*
---
Sorry for bad image quality
---
Basically, it‚Äôs a brawler that uses a staff and ground magic, and summons spikes to attack enemies. Idk the name yet
---
Main Attack- Staff Smash: Brawler manipulates dirt into spikes that do more damage as the travel away from the brawler. At the main area he targets, 3 larger spikes pop up each having a 0.5 tile knockback.
---
Damage-
---
Small Spikes: 50, 100, 150, 200
---
Large Spikes: 400 each
---
Super- Terrestrial Tremor: Brawler uses full force on the ground, summoning 5 large spikes and 3 giant stone spikes. These spikes would each have 750 hitpoints and not disappear until destroyed or moved. Additionally, if touched they will deal damage over time.
---
Stone Spikes: 500 each, 100 dps
---
They can also even do it better
---
Is this too op?
---
[removed]
---
I have not gotten a brawler since summer
---
If it is a joke, there‚Äôs no humor flair. We wouldn‚Äôt know.
---
Funny you said that cuz I am actually planning to do a concept art of little improvements to matches and how they can really affect the game
---
ahoy, comrade

---
Helloo in brawl stars you constantly move around while trying to hit your shots and that needs skill but in clash royale you need to be more strategic because you wanna do the best pushes to defeat your opponents towers
---
Ohh ok
---
This is excellent matchup by supercell.
---
After hitting my head with 950+ trophy matchups with below 700 tick for a day (and other brawlers since 1st Nov when supercell broke it) I decided it is time to start a gaming break. And I have.
---
It was just too humiliating to play
---
yes, and sticky mains (they spam stickies and explode, never uses primary or melee no matter what)
---
Everybody gangsta till the mortis comes with 20 powercubes.

use your tickets

Yes

I'm not sure.

How?

I like it a lot - the star power is just like Vengeful Spirit's ultimate in DoTA, who is one of my favourite heroes.

I'm so glad this glitch isn't patched.

Oh so the frames per second decrease as the ping gets lower??
---
kairos absolutely.  makes most detailed and helpful videos.
---
cory is 2nd best, he makes very helpful videos , sometimes over exaggerates or over hypes but still good.
---
3rd is lex, he invites brawler voice actors and makes 1v1 interactions.
---
rest are kinda meh. wonderbrad is one of those "funny video" YouTubers but much less cringe and actually watchable. radical makes videos on balance changes and their impact.
---
Bull's paradise
---
most likely leon
---
Very nice bro !
---
If you want feedback I would say the first starpower is too strong and it should be 2 to 2.5 second
---
But if I don't get 80 gems in time?
---
All of these are great ideas that I'd love to see in game. But overall, what Supercell has to accept is that, if they want their "moba" braw-shooting game to be more than just a mobile game, they have to act like so. Patch your game, add options, customization, do something with clubs... I know SC is always listening to this reddit, but they might have to do a little more than just acknowledge us.
---
R/antimeme
---
road rage carl is better. and Christmas ones will be without discount so probably neither.
---
you get about 40 to 50 gems per month, this shouldn't be happening unless you don't collect all boxes

Goodbye funny gamemode

Bo with Circling Eagle... yes I can see it now...

We don't know your fucking taste in skins. Stop wasting your time on reddit just for the sake of it

Thanksgiving update ?

U mad?

As much as I like the game mode, some Brawlers have obvious advantage. Think: Piper, Tick, Gene...
---
My thoughts this morning
---
All i have is leon at 11000
---
NSFW NSFW means not safe for work enabling potentially sensitive text, image and video to be surfaced
---
Link https://crux.page.link/UE28F
---
It's always the players with 10+ powercubes that are focused on killing other players tho
---
They are not related at all
---
That's how I got to 1000 bull. Use the correct strategy, just focus on the bot.
---
#Ball's
---
Nyta
---
Honestly I don't mind, they've been working really hard. Plus that gives me a chance to catch up with upgrades!
---
That would be very cool
---
??? How is this nsfw???
---
Me: Turns off particles
---
Leon: Instantly disappears
---
Me: Confused Screaming
---
I agree
---
imagine a bull or shelly standing there and it gets covered by "Miniature" Map and you walk near...
---
apparently soon?
---
But Spike is a legendary :D
---
Happy cake day to u,happy cake day to uuu,
---
I like how this is a repost from a long time ago with your watermark put over it now
---
It's up to you..
---
Try to watch every BS Youtuber and decide it yourself :)
---
don't shake the screen
---
Why do you have to shake the fucking screen
---
Alive: blue dot
---
Close to death: yellow dot
---
Dead: red spot spots spawn
---
Teamate too
---
This idea has been requested multiple times and I honestly think it might be part of the next update. That's because Ryan said in Twitter it would be a very small update which could mean many quality of life features that would overall make the game better, not forgetting any bug fixes
---
Next small update:
---
What im trying to say that you dont need much experience with clash royale to be good you just need to be good at doing strategies not being good at putting down troops but in brawl stars you could have a bad strategie but still win if you are better at the game than your opponents are
---
Everyone is used to the regular bcuz we havent gotten the chance to have a different position
---
Barley had the opportunity to attack jessie, but he didn‚Äôt
---
And remember by planning a small update means that a they have more time to plan a larger update
---
Wtf?
---
Lol
---
Oh sh*t its too cute but i dont think its good for posting this in this sub, this sub contains lots of child under 10
---
Thank you!(I will make this on paper)
---
G(re)at (post)
---
Shelly, wut r u doing
---
Ironic
---
IDK but i had 4 upvotes before
---
I want this ingame!
---
That's what happens if you try playing any mode that have expired. I used to play brawl ball until the very last second so it's a familiar notification, thank god now it's there to stay.
---
Hi.. Can i record this gameplay and post it on my Youtube channel (Lang Buaya Gaming)?
---
I will put your Reddit name in this video :)
---
I need Gene, Spike and Sandy at 5.7k. Nice pull
---
They usually fight after the big threat is out of the way. Have you never been pinched before?
---
It literally says in the bottom right corner.
---
Nice!
---
Dude if you skilled enaught mortis is the best so?
---
Still can't understand Bull's nerf
---
r/unexpected

An insult would be this comment you just made. Considering you don't know the difference between a stolen post and a similar idea..
---
Nah barely was strong especially with star power medical use.
---
Did you mean: HO HO HO!
---
Me
---
how do you guys get those brawler things
---
 Shark leon*
---
I am pretty sure obly dumb people fall for these. If you dont like the vids, just block the channel.
---
I know that I used barley with medical use. What I‚Äôm saying is barleys range and area of effect is shorter and lasts less and he can‚Äôt spam the entire damn map with it. He was strong but at least he wasn‚Äôt annoying.
---
Thank God it's gone, now just remove takedown and were good
---
I didn't use clickbait but I still got a decent amount of views. If you think you need clickbait to get views, that means you think your videos aren't good enough.
---
Also Brawl Stars funny moments are too overdone. Think of more unique content like my brawl stars Family Tree video.
---
You hate it as the bo or nita
---
This is a repost

Thanks for this! This is what I aim to do. I‚Äôve been using bushes a lot more tactically. I‚Äôve found that when playing El Primo and The Bull it works effectively to use guerilla tactics!
---
I like Poco because you can charge your super at the very start of the match if the team bunch up and you hit all hit shots.
---
Not repost, i make, the credits in the corner who make the original image.

"No! Dont jump!" *puts camera down* "ok now jump!"

r/foundthehondacivic
---
Challenge accepted, its not gonna be that hard becase i got used to bs on the menus and stuff.
---
My guess is that it'll mostly be some balance changes, QoL stuff and probly a few skins. The team deserves a bit of rest after so many big updates

The best map for Ticks players

How did u kick the ball and still be invisible?

At least you have close to enough, im 400 away from darryl
---
Nice
---
Are we just going to leave life leech there, supercell?
---
If the whole other team is inactive and you kill them over and over
---
If I ain‚Äôt broke Imma award that
---
Give credit to the original digital type even if you draw this.
---
I have hard time believing it was more unpopular then lose star, takedown and last but not least the siege
---
Me who doesnt like graveyard shift: nice
---
So spike
---
The fact that I'm doing nothing right now shows my resolve!
---
What's wrong with it?
---
people will post those graveyard shift gone post to farm karm
---
and thats a fact
---
But bulls hide in bushes &gt;,3
---
I want a green one to see when my teammate is healing
---
Pizza pasta mamma mia, italiani pure qua?
---
It might just be a replay glitch or smth
---
Unpopular opinion ahead o honestly didn't think life leach is that good yeah it can basically stop 99.99%of teaming but it ain't that big pf a deal
---
The below zero damage should be #420#
---
You could easily replace siege, takedown or boss fight with graveyard shift.
---
Dont flex your skin like that, its a weak flex
---
He was playing solo, ya turd.

Supercells plan: Make new brawler, make brawler OP, Profit, Nerf to oblivion, repeat

Hey guys! First of all good luck, you‚Äôre amazing skilled individuals. Right now I‚Äôm in the market for a new phone/tablet to play brawl stars on. Could you please tell me what devices do you guys use so I can know what to look for please üôèüôèüòç‚ù§Ô∏è?

If you look at the ground, you can know where you are and where the middle is, x on the middle and lines as squares growing bigger as you go to the border of the map.

It‚Äôs only possible to get star player if your team wins or if the game is a draw. If it‚Äôs a draw then anyone can get star player.
---
Miss the old times
---
That what i had in mind
---
*sad ghost spike noises
---
It has (had?) the only good system of any game modes. You needed to think ahead of your moves. And most importantly it was only game mode where many tanks were useless. So refreshing. No shellys, no bulls etc...
---
I never want to see my internet connection
---
What's up kairos! I bought Calavera Piper using your code. Probably my proudest moment spending gemsüòÑüòÑüòÑ. I'm f2p btw.
---
I have a friend who raised crow lvl 1 to 1000 trophies :p
---
No it's not. You can be star player even if your team loses

Hope there is CHRISTMAS NIGHT which is same as life leech
---
Not possible :p

Not anymore it's not

they need to change bo or dynamike's rarity if they add it in 2k or 3k

Is it still in the showdown rotation?

Some voices are good and I want to know how woudl spike sound like
---
yeah so? are you the one losing trophies when they get last place? ive never seen anyone focus on players and then complain that they did not win.
---
Check coach cory's video about recent balance changes, or simply enter the game and check yourself if you have spike, if not then pull over with first option
---
Well Yes but actually no
---
Nope, someone got Pam, Tara and Spike from a big box.
---
I just tested, its kinda trash :/
---
yes yes yes!!!
---
Crow better
---
graveyard shift is a shit .

Please read my post in its entirety before commenting, thank you very much.

Bad user design principle though, cause there‚Äôs a certain percentage of population that‚Äôs Color blind.

Normal attack's fire radius is like normal, super attack's fire radius is like Penny's turret's using "Balls Of Fire"
---
Congrats man
---
That's why I changed to fertilize
---
Yeah Mortis always steals my kills
---
If you are a mortis god he can work
---
I feel like I'm one of the only people that didn't actually like that gamemode
---
Mine either lol
---
My memes never get on meme review üôÅ
---
I know, the friends and the Club member, but I mean it should be focused on the power level too
---
Fricc u
---
and we do we have to care about your karma

&amp;#x200B;

also rule 2 of this subreddit

You posted sth like this more than one time...

yikes

They said it on Twitter?

#Plays showdown as Penny and her turret gets star player
---
I'm just asking wth is funny?
---
I bought caveman frank for 39 gems on sale so why is Carl only 59 gems on sale
---
Ticket events
---
hold up you arent op
---
Then matchmaking would take 3x longer.
---
You can push Gene in lone star pretty high, especially with the damage star power
---
What
---
ye, from the supers shelly's is high up there, but not only can she not charge it cause of her low range, her low stats bring the super down, so in that regard, i agree with u
---
Well I'm playing for like 11 Months and yeah I've noticed that, but still new players could not see that
---
This needs to be done!
---
I was thinking of making a frosty character but yours is way better than mine would be üòÖ
---
I play on 2 devices Tab and my phone,on my phone I cant see the countdown of the shield,on my tab I can 
---
Sorry for my bad english
---
All I can say is two seasons ago where I pushed on 1k Colt in takedown the only ones over ~800 you can‚Äôt trust are crow and piper and obviously if you get too close also bull but basically all colts were fine
---
What time does the world championship start?
---
More like: your entire team has low health, but one enemy has low health too and poco uses his super, not to heal all of your team, but to kill the low health brawler from the enemy team, cause he has screeching solo and then you and your other low health teammate get killed by the other 2 enemies and the poco now is alone against the 2 brawlers and dies too. 
---
He then thinks his teammates are shit, cause he made a kill as healer, while his mates just died, but he is the one who is shit cause he played poco wrong and didn't heal as healer. Always those randomes who think the team with more kills wins and just go for kills, not for the goal of the mode
---
both are masterpieces...
---
*i am starplayer*
---
This Darryl camp makes me uncomfortable
---
oh ok
---
power play is the most fun gamemode
---
I have the same confusion. What exactly are global players.
---
the november update will not have a new brawler but the december update will have
---
Wow. Gg moi j'ai aucun brawler pouvoir max
---
Garbage
---
I recommend you not put pictures of yourself there are some creeps out there yo
---
But it will be option to disable this
---
How
---
I posted it!
---
If only there were a button that could make it so you couldnt hear the other players in a voice chat system if they start doing that... shame nobody has thought of that
---
Is the opposite
---
Is not that bad
---
Roses are red bulls hide in the shrub
---
I team wiped a lot and died very few times.
---
The one time I did die, my teammates decided to let them score. And that was that. üåö
---
Ur less than half my trophies and you have 3 legendaries... bruh wtf is wrong with this game
---
I had this happen twice,  during the special trophy matches. lost both games.  I was HEATED
---
*Brawl Stars amiibo when?*
---
+7???
---
Says the one that has FaZe in their name.
---
This Star Power is in the gamefiles. It makes her her auto-attack and her Super thinner. It increases her range though. You can also get the maximum DMG one tile further away from the target. You don't have to stand in the enemy
---
"Don't make me get Nita?" Even without this pathetic line, it's the cringiest, most out pf character low effort voice that exists in the game. It's pure shit
---
more like
---
***COCONUT GUN***
---
Pre global is the low res.
---
Woooh yaa
---
I wish this get addet it will help so much
---
Bruh she can charge half of it from hitting only 420 damage (1 pellet) at max range from 3 shots... wym?!?!
---
I think i have seen this before
---
What am I supposed to do with this information?
---
This is the most braindead post of this month. Quite an achivement
---
CHAAAAAAARGE
---
Wow man, sooo late, I didn‚Äôt even remember this comment üòÇ
---
Not pre global, a low res meaning less particles, and it's easier for the processor to calculate
---
I'm insulting Tick IN Life Leech (or Graveyard Shift doesn't really matter) because how broken he is there,he should be "disabled" in Life Leech,he is stronger even than Crow and Barley...
---
I miss my dad
---
That's trueüëç I think it can be sometimes bad if you have too much brawlers, it's harder to get a star power, I think so
---
This bug doesn't make anything worse, it's just a fun bug that doesn't need to be fixed
---
No i made this myself
---
You can hold the picture then click save image
---
No.
---
It's only in friendly games and only when playing alone, and it's fun, so no.
---
There are way more btw, try e.g. Brock's 1st on Colt.
---
Thanks for telling me (no sarcasm)
---
Imagine seeing a dog detach its head, and then the head starts running towards you and explodes

Well,of you have every brawler you'll have more chances to find a star power, but if you have a lot of brawlers that could get a star power you have less chances to find them. It makes sense

Bruh it only works in games with bots there's no reason to fix it.

The same for duo showdown

So I'am talking about the whole process, it's sometimes hard to get power points on brawler you need, and also a lot of gold

Mine toüòÖüòÖ
---
The Spike was a pretty good player tho ngl
---
Wtf is ranked
---
Yeah thats true good point
---
Anthony
---
Ah yes, indeed I can't find power points for EMZ and Spike
---
In friendly match (only with bots) select one brawler then quickly select other and QUICKLY press play button
---
Thanks üç∞ü§ô
---
Try it with Brock 1st star power + Colt üëç
---
Cool, it's a nice phone and Brawl Stars works pretty good on itüòâ
---
I sometimes just buy them for gems, iam really lucky with them
---
It doesnt matter me. I am happy because of this!!!!
---
Yeah man, loved his vids, now he‚Äôs a joke.
---
mortis players understand this
---
But I only just draw it Moron.
---
yes it's worth it (btw i buyed white crow instead of sakura only for his remodel)
---
Congrats
---
DASH AND DESTROY
---
What if instead of holding a microphone he WAS the microphone? That'd be pretty awesome, huh?
---
–ë–∞–π—Ç -_-
---
The only time I got two brawlers was in a big box, El Primo then luckily Piper, usually I would think you would get a super rare but I‚Äôll take it.
---
thanks you! Bibi next :)
---
I mean i payed 30$ and have everything, every brawler with every star power, so i'm also one of those rich people, even if i don't feel rich, but being able to pay 30$ is considered rich, so see ya later peasants
---
Copied off someone ;-;
---
He Was Nearly Idol In The Whole Match
---
SUPER SAIYAN TOXIC ASSASSIN
---
Can relate
---
I still don't know if there is rule 63 art of sandy on the rule 34 sub of brawl stars, but i'm too afraid to check
---
It's Not About Good Or Bad.. He Got Killed By Opponents Intentionally, Every Single Time He Re-Spawned
---
Ha?! Its showing the üëå
---
Since When do you play
---
If You Also Get A Player Who Is Mostly Idol In Whole Match, What Will You Do ??
---
This is a failing only on you I'm afraid.
---
Learn the maps and relative positions of spawns. A minimal covering the game screen is not something we need or want.
---
I don't think i got Star Player.. It's either Mortis or Pam..
---
But i really appreciate + love this kind of randoms teammates.. I didn't contribute much, just 7,8 times attack and collect gems :)
---
Ligma mom?
---
I actually like this bug and use it when I am bored, doesn't need any fix.
---
Try EMZ/Jessie/Nita with 8 Bit 1st star power.
---
The auto aim is 0:30
---
what remodel?
---
I dare you, go look (report back)
---
Leon teaches people that auto aim is good, Which is bad
---
Bruh
---
I mean you don't know if he is still a boy in his animations, you know even boys can wear girl clothes and pad their chest to feel like they have titts (they mostly are refered as traps)
---
Well you didn't mention that he was AFK, so I assumed you were making fun of his trophies! That makes way more sense.
---
Maybe Tick think Brock useless..
---
To me, it's Tick and Dyna become totally useless (because of my teammate Mortis) :)
---
Bruh you just posted 
---
# C R I N G E
---
I also don‚Äôt have it enabled tho, and i‚Äôm too lazy. I‚Äôll give a 1 upvote bounty to anyone who checks and reports back
---
You maybe didnt open as much boxes cuz i've been playing since global and have 15k and am missing sandy and have an even higher legendary chance and I have been collecting as many boxes as possible
---
Can this stop being posted after every event?
---
Or bibi
---
Interesting good idea m8
---
Neon Leon

8-fit
---
I started brawl stars on beta release, spend 30$ and maxed my account. My clash royale account on the other hand isn't maxed till now, i also started it on beta release and probably spend a few 100$
---
I watched his video and when he said that i was like... bruh...
---
No ahit there are like bunch of bones and tnt lying around and like 50% map is empty
---
Rico: its free real estate
---
Bruh I‚Äôm at almost 12k and I still don‚Äôt have a legendary üòê
---
Br≈´h that image is like from the beta times
---
Yes I used to be in that club üòÇüòÇ
---
Oh, but it still doesnt make sense why this would be a thing. Cant i just replay my matches simply because i want to? I dont get why shouldnt i be able to..
---
Sandy was release in September while Leon in December. So don‚Äôt need to worry about
---
And if you are still missing legendaries, an extra 0.0137% to your legendary chance ü§ì
---
Should say ‚Äúwhen I‚Äôm farting‚Äù
---
pretty normal, had my first at 14.5k after 2 months of making/losing trophies, opened a mega box and found nothing, then blue box and boom SANDY
---
Fixed lol
---
Only 2 months ago?.... What is you percentage to get a leg?
---
Id actually prefer an interesting one once every 2 months or so
---
üëè
---
I meant pam can beat them but im not gonna argue
---
Thanks
---
moment of silence for boss fight
---
My favourite showdown map.
---
I‚Äôm currently at 10k with everyone except 3 legendaries and I have everyone full on starpoints
---
I mean, it just depends on luck, there are people getting their first legendary at a few hundred trophies and there are people who don't have a legendary on 17k trophies (i've seen account of both kind of players, i mean sure you see here many posts about someone who has 1-2 legendaries on a few hundred legendaries, but i've just once seen an account of someone with 17k trophies and no legendary), anyway i would say if you are on 12k without a legendary, then you're unlucky, the higher trophies you are, the unluckier you are, so if you already got one on 3k, then you were lucky at the time and now if you are on 14.5k with still just one legendary, then you aren't lucky anymore, you start to get unlucky
---
but Mecha Crow with Star Shelly color palette looks way better than him
---
Indeed

Can someone tell me where this place is ?!
---
Cool
---
Creo que se llama boomer a las personas viejas
---
Don't you know, boomers don't care about the trophies and the legendaries some randome guy has in brawl stars, you need to be a zoomer to care about a randome guy in brawl stars, so if you don't care you're a boomer /s
---
I wish my boxes in brawl stars were like my boxes on this bot. On the bot I got Mortis and Leon.
---
Emz's tone is the wrong shade dude.
---
lol
---
Because everyone is saying it all of a sudden and I dont get it.
---
That is awesome.
---
Gracias pero nose pq me dice eso
---
An event so legendary must have left them speechless...
---
this is amazing
---
I'm also in high school
---
and clash royale
---
yeah i still cant belive he did that , im 20,300 with just 10000 üò¢
---
unique idea, but i think your should work on the name
---
Sorry sir or madam I only speak ingrish

Top 15 best fan art skins. But hope the art can be better

Teaming in real life

I can hear it wtf

#I CAN DO ANYTHING

I gotta be honest, kinda looks like an amiibo

What's wrong with cavern churn?

The big one is number 5
---
Ik it‚Äôs ok
---
#JEANS
---
definitely
---
Got starplayer while afk
---
So, we are not talking about the 200 trophy Brock?
---
This is fine as long as we can toggle it off.
---
Happens to my friend with sandy
---
TEAMKAIROS
---
Thanks some people get mad when I miss spell but you where great
---
1. No. Flying fantasies is worse. Rock wall brawl is worse. The only teaming is throwers and the occasional bo with star powers.
---
2. Again, no. Throwers spamming auto aim will miss 100% of their shots. Throwers are easy af to dodge if you have a brain.
---
3. Again. No. Barley has the highest win rate above 600. Followed by Mike. Tick is 3rd. Rico is 4th. Bo is 5th. Shelly and bull aren‚Äôt even top 5.
---
4. Accurate 
---
5. Bo with circling eagle doesn‚Äôt hold a shotgun and often can very easily control mid
---
6. Spawn location has a huge impact on every showdown map. That‚Äôs not unique to cavern churn
---
7. Not really unless you control the middle. The outsides if you try to camp, you‚Äôll be forced out by a rico or thrower about 80% of the time.
---
if they drew the nipples they are gonna get a ripple
---
It good man I'm sorry for your effort.
---
No they arnt lmao, trap is a slur anyways.
---
I‚Äôve see you around a lot
---
I wish i can go there and p.s thats ryan
---
Virginia too eh? freshman
---
Ikr it looks spectacular
---
Hi crow
---
üòÇ
---
This isn't even that impressive

I think he means why does it change color when he throws it?

Looks great

I'm in Seoul :(
