It looks good but I think it's a little bit unnecessary. The normal Colt I think is already a cowboy.

---
I stars playing this game since the firts day, before the time line with the brawlers doesn't exist. And 4 that I have Dynamike and Bo with 1k thropies xdüòÇ thx‚ù§Ô∏è
---
It's removed?
---
Yump is number two in the world. I posted the replay earlier 
---
No, Its 6;15 had a match end at exactly 6:15 today, for max tickets
---
Why?
---
XdddüòÇ
---
What the heck are you talking about?!? What ‚Äúbox‚Äù? I would chill out on the caps if you would not ACT SO STUPID
---
Bas mamu im jebem sve kradu
---
What survey
---
ü§î
---
Oh, ok sorry for the misconception. I checked out some of your brawlers and they are also amazing. Keep up the good work.
---
I thought bull was the father
---
I hardly consider this an exploit solely because it‚Äôs so difficult to pull off. You cannot fail even 1 jump
---
I‚Äôll play robo rumble with you. But I just drank a Pepsi. And now I‚Äôm horny. Do you think you can massage my penis and genitals. And I come come on the floor all my white gooey jizz. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm just really horny 
---
lmao that would be perfect. Although I hear there‚Äôs a new exploit with Dynamike and his star power which makes it possible to get max time again. Much harder to do though.
---
Looks cool
---
rreeppoosstt
---
You can literally prove yourself wrong right now. 6:15. 
---
no
---
Atleast is not a animal skin.Good skin and we see his eyes.
---
JUST DO IT!
---
What do you mean?
---
Precious!
---
just tell me how many brawlers you got with money 1,2 or 3
---
Yeah some bones maybe lol i went crazy with em
---
WHY?! \*insert the song\*
---
pleeeease add this skin!! why don't you guys add any features/skins from this subreddit? they look soo cool! 
---
A predator. He EL PRIMOOOOOS right into prison with his 12 Gems.
---
Bot
---
I w a n t t h i s s o b a d
---
What I am SAYING is that I have bad memory and I cant REMEMBER how many thats why I put 1-3
---
Very well done!
---
This is why when I'm one or two trophies away from a milestone I just go into showdown and bushcamp to make sure that I minimize the chances of losing trophies.
---
cool, seems like something you‚Äôd tbf
---
heres my team code: XRWWUCVU
---
This is real btw I didn‚Äôt edit this üòÇ
---
Tbf?
---
Yeah we definitly need another furry. Good artwork though
---
‚Äòto be fair‚Äô its an abbreviation 
---
50% usually means connection issues for me
---
Thats cuz primo is a lil bit faster than most characters
---
I think i laughed at this longer that i should.
---
She already foxy
---
Thank you.
---
Now he has even more ability to elbow into the enemy team with the gems.
---
The matchmaking is fine, that Pam just spent a lot of money. 
---
‚Äúradoms‚Äù
---
I failed a jump in the video, but 2 fails in a row will  most certainly F you up
---
Dynamike let's you do that?
---
I feel like the goal is too open 
---
This idea was brought up million times but it's good to repeat it until SC makes it real.
---
Level 1s going up against a level 10 is not just fine
---
Lmao yes
---
You must get him to level 10 for his star power first
---
Or bounty 
---
Blackbeard 2.0
---
smells like broke in here
---
Maintain your distance when attack. Avoid bull and El primob if you can. If have to face them try to maintain distance with the wall, if they get any closer, your are dead. 
---
token doubler will double it tho? meaning it should be even...
---
I have all and didn't pay
---
Make Dragon Knight Jessie attack an Electric arrow. That should be better 
---
With dynamike super this is this place where you can keep jumping over the wall and the bots will turn around and they will keep following you
---
If you want to play for kills , then where is Bounty 
---
Low effort meme templates with crow and el primo and stuff are fine though?
---
Oh but that requires lvl 10 not as good as EL PRIMO
---
And by taking out over half the walls they made a new map and replaced the old on. 
---
And skins
---
But it takes more skills and you can‚Äôt max time as easily 
---
BS is a MOBA tho
---
Wow, that was aggressive. 
---
Yeah, but its an exploit so wtf cares about skill
---
But still
---
Bounty and Heist in one day is pretty cruel
---
Well, Cavern Churn strategy would change if it had that map, but Vault Guard is basically the same strategy in both versions.
---
Spike is viable on heist, but he‚Äôs definitely not the best option. If I were pushing high trophy heist, I would not have a spike on my team for the most part
---
My bad didn‚Äôt see gene pay to win 
---
Rico is the best super rare. r/RicoGang
---
Dont blame randoms XD u could stop playing  when u Lost 20 or 30 and not keep going XD if u keep playing tilted u are going to lose all the games
---
\#Stopthespin! please supercell, restore the only solo mode you have in this game.
---
Dude... what???
---
The dynamike did what's right #stopthespin
---
You have 2 and have .17?  Right now I have Crow and Leon and mine is at .0096
---
Fortnight?
---
F .r/RicoGang
---
Lmao tf
---
r/RicoGang
---
Maybe those would be weekly
---
Maybe for low trophies it wouldn‚Äôt change.  
---
Can you post stuff like this on my new subreddit r/StopTeaming
---
But Showdown is supposed to be a battle royale. And besides, even in MOBAs like LOL, they still keep track of kills. Idk why people are so against a KILL COUNTER. Its not like im asking SC to completely change the entire game, just a simple counter for kills. 
---
I‚Äôve been playing since June 2017 and got my first when leon was released so that why it‚Äôs still decently high
---
Wait if its without randoms then how did you get double Pam?
---

---

Poco‚Äôs super doesn‚Äôt damage enemies... I just got your joke.
---
Did you just comment on your own post
---
Yes they run faster because they are so easy to counter, you can literally walk the other direction. Tanks do take skill you must know how to dodge

No need to thank me.

Because according to supercell its a strategy
---
Ray would have range similar to colt, and her speed would be regular. Her reload would be medium. Let me know what you think!
---
Don't mess with the Bull!!!

Thanks I just checked. I have .13%... I know it was going to be low but holy crap that is sooooooo low

disappointed to be a crow affiliated with you

Yea I think it goes up 0.0004 or something like that every time you open a certain number of boxes
---
If you go in the news tab in brawl stars and there‚Äôs a link

That is one hell of a slow progress
---
Wait what lmao
---
Finally not a furry, good job
---
Yuuup
---
You didn't attach a map

yeah like when they bounce? and then his Super would be giant Pumpkins haha
---
Yeah
---
When and where?

Ok thanks

How do a lot of my friend that started wayyy after me have legendaries while I have none lol

Do do do do do do

Yeees!

You are a genius!!

_accidentally uses super on her_ "Well sh*t.".

I love the art btw!

Those walls are begging for primo

Same !

I like the art! Why doesn't he wear the helmet as well haha

This is breaking a rule of the subreddit ( advertising)

If you use sarcasm, consider typing ‚Äú/s‚Äù at the end for the sake of clarity. Also, if you hit ‚Äúreply‚Äù on a comment, it‚Äôll keep the thread nice and tidy. It MIGHT keep you from looking foolish in the future, but it can only do so much.

i give the gems if you record and buy it :v
---
To be fair my science teacher looks like this
---
How did you put Jessie in your profile
---
The second panel works so well
---
Him saying "I'm a creature of the night!" sure leads me to believe that Mortis is getting another remodel (or a skin).
---
Not remodel
---
Another amazing creation! I'm excited for the others.
---
I thought you were referring the old brock ad the monkey 
---
Bull is the dad to me
---
I liked his old beach skin
---
Teamers: damn it, we lost 
---
Poco: Haha GG EZ 
---
U know why midget brawlers are always laughing while they are playing brawl ball?
---
You are a hero for your name
---
Why the bounce though?
---
I have these kinda games in duos
---
u/phlorpe How do you feel about this great art?  
---
It's amazing! I never seen someone do art of someone else's concept so this art's a first. Great job!
---
First time ?üåö
---
WE MUST NOT STAND BACK!
---
On another vault defenders map, you could create holes in big chunks of blocks with supers and place any entity in there(turret, bear, mike, primo) to make a place impossible to access. This broke the ai and meant that robots that targeted the player would just stand still and not attack as long as others didn‚Äôt get too close to them. To fix this, supercell made sure vault defenders maps no longer formed big dumps that could be hid inside of, and instead opted for long stretches of blocks(shown in this map and post) it‚Äôs now been quite predictably exploited as shown in the video.
---
It matches people based on their total trophies, not brawler trophies 
---
Rofl
---
/s
---
To make it unique, and that‚Äôs what SoulHero3 suggested, anyways it‚Äôs just an idea

Imagine trying to defend someone who intentionally threw a match

The 80 gem tickets are more worth 
---
Agreed. It really bothers me that crappy memes aren't removed by mods either. I really love art, strategy, ideas, and all sorts of helpful and effort posts, but there's some posts that are so bad you think "why aren't they removed?"
---
Just dash back and forth around a loop to make the robots come after you the other way around
---
Not even level 69
---
That can be changed, example, if you let pressed L2 while moving right stick it would use the super and use R2 for auto aiming

Use Pam and bull instead of colt and Rico. You‚Äôll get at least 5:30.

Also, potentially MIRV Missiles, for any Fallout players.

I love your art style here. They should totally make this skin.

Just made a similar post but yours is deeper.  Crow is good.  Super fun

He needs his voice buffed. Man doesn't hold a feather (eh?) To how they sounded in the "No time to explain" trailer.

Did u use any money?

This is beyond science
---
Rip

I like **radom** teammates too....
---
I dont have any legendaries either and I'm almost at 4k. You just gotta get good with the ones you have. 
---
Poco counters mortis confirmed
---
That jacket making him look kinda homophobic, no hate though.
---
Bold of you to assume he can't just absorb it into his pompadour
---
That‚Äôs awesome 
---
u forgot how the storm works apparently
---
This aint fortnite bro
---
Brawl talk Tommorow?
---
Exactly 
---
The Pam was probably just getting star token. still stupid though...
---
Link?
---
They already got skins,and then they would have to aesthetically change all the skins too,and also the 3d models of brawl are much more detailed,it would be a lot of work
---
I mean that‚Äôs a fair point. But I think it‚Äôs also reasonable for me to say I don‚Äôt like the gamemode because I don‚Äôt find it fun. 
---
Even worse, rolling to an enemy brawler only to bounce first and miss the chance to defeat them
---
Amazing, dude! I just reached 5520 throphies since global, when I started playing.
---
Very true, you know how there are footsteps when you walk around somewhere, there should be like trails you can have. 
---
So he is a noob if he has 9999 trophies?
---
I love it, I'm super flattered and it brings me so much joy to inspire others to do their own art ;)
---
Good! Let‚Äôs hope he stays strong so throwers teaming In showdown can go away
---
What?
---
48,228 gems, if I did the math in my head correctly, being too lazy to use the calculator
---
Who said it was from OP's point of view amirite????

I found it! One has 2 power cubes

Maybe they talked to help and support... idk lol

How many trophies does ur Crow have?

This is so sad Alexa play Despacito

You unlocked crow at 4K trophies... why does supercell hate me üòî
---
Yes I agree he does not need any nerfs
---
There‚Äôs already this thing in the game called skins. 
---
Hahaha in fact this map to give a chance to darryl because it is very strong in these places
---
I just want him to have a buff because he‚Äôs been the worse legendary brawler for a long while now. Just want a change in meta... also cause he‚Äôs the only legendary I have lol
---
I know, but you can add this on top of that. Do you have any suggestions?
---
You guys need to chill with the bushes
---
Nice skin
---
Lmao that would of been funny to watch
---
I got it yesterdayüòÇ 6:12 minutes
---
Thanks
---
Don't die in the match
---
They need to make a Cosmic line of skins and add a Cosmic Tara that throws a black hole for her Super.
---
Darryl wouldn't be a good choice here. Brawlers like Bull and Shelly could easily circle around with the bushes and ambush weaker brawlers such as Darryl. In general, brawler-specific maps probably aren't going to turn out well. I'd focus more on type-specific maps (eg. ranged brawlers, tanks, etc.).
---
Dont copy other people‚Äôs posts. Someone already done this with Piper. 
---
Hey,  we need someone with max dinamike.  Just one person. 
---
That‚Äôs exactly why it‚Äôs changed.
---
Neat, what creation will you be working on next?
---
Now this, is what im looking for, go check my post its a petition for a better trophy road
---
Lmao good point. I guess people want "Exploiter" on their record.

Well... I did it too anyways. :/

Damn, he can do crazy shit. Ppl think it's trash but I've seen people do weird shit with it. Mainly escape but, even just to hop over a bull or Primo chasing you. Then super 
---
I'm a fake one 
---
Hotsoop is a bot. When you start playing the game, you always meet this accounts in battle log. Just create new and watch, if them get so many trophies in sd, why they playing in 3/3 like bots? And always they had one brawler with the lowest trophies which he playing with you. 
---
Frank doesnt technically counter anyone tho... i would say nita or colt
---
Good enough 
---
Have you never seen Sephirot's wing?
---
And the tongue lol
---
I had that in mind making this post... bullshit honestly
---
Golden Rico and barley would look the same lol
---
Let's be honest, lvl 6 El Primo can destroy every lvl 1 brawler that play at 30 trophies 
---
Idea: Maybe the microphone could be changed to a guitar
---
This made me happy 
---
This is the most accurate showdown related post I've ever seen it's so accurate is sad

Bob the builder
---
Back in the day when robo rumble has 2 cool maps
---
Exactly.
---
Happens to me ALL the time. I get targeted by like 15 meteors in a row 95% of the games I play. It‚Äôs like the game just wants to kill you.
---
I'm at 2700 trophies and I can't push because I'm stuck with 12 brawlers, I don't find anyone since 600 trophies apart from Dinamyke.

Or simply maybe he just got hit by someone else and he‚Äôll regenerate his health sooner

solo means you are playing alone like everyplayers does ,you are not suppose to team up and kill them to push your trophies if you want to team up play duo‚Äôs. Its not written in terms that teaming in solo matches is legal .

Never said it‚Äôs illegal either

Frank has only one skin.

Most of their comments/posts are.

I mean I like the concepted but since it's narrow it would be hard to play brocks, pipers, etc. And lobbers (throwers) would be wayy too op on this map

Wait is sans an animal?

Whenever u unlocked a new brawler , there will be a lot of bo. Cuz ppl jz reached 3k and a lot of them got bo and played with it. I m at 9.4k and even when I got gene , I also played against a lot of bo until after like 200/300  trophies

Never seen the godfather...still hilarious

That doesn't prove any thing, he can get first account to 10k, then start a new account, get it to 9k, then start new account.

So? Is he not allowed to have fun?

How much you‚Äòve spent?

He‚Äôs not being an asshole. He‚Äôs making a mini account, then gemming it to max with HIS OWN money(it‚Äôs just a choice), then having fun. How is that being an asshole?

How did you put that blue thing before finally

Not a single one here upvoted ü•∫

Piper crow and gene

Excel for Heist? Cool!

pam, jessie and bull are the best i believe

I know it‚Äôs the best offer to get but all I‚Äôm saying is that 80gems isn‚Äôt worth 19.2 boxes. In my opinion

bull is mainly used for the boss to kill him quickly, but i guess primo is also a good replacement
---
I preferred popcorn one.
---
Yes,actually, no
---
Is a very very very very very good idea
---
I am literally angry. Supercell needs to give players over 4000 at least one free lego if they don't have one
---
Then you get really sad when this pops up: "This player has too many friend requests. Please try again later." :'(
---
Or when they deny your request. Why???
---
Is there a lot of difference or improvement??
---
Any advantages using his star power??
---
True. That was the mortis, colt, rico team. That could position themselves to bring the robos down one path (wall gap) to maximize their supper dps together. No one could get max time with that tho. 
---
During soft launch the map was very different however. At that time there was also a glitch where the boss could spawn directly on the safe.

Since it's an offical survey from brawl stars team I see nothing wrong with a battle pass. Or maybe some Different sort of Thing that kind of battle pass system? Like in clash royale global tourneys you can buy additional Rewards for gems

Doesnt say I cant
---
Happened to me once before, you still get the items from the MBOX

In clash universe gems are green and so are in brawl stars but purple also makes sense because it's a gem grab or heist gem so yeah

It is obvious who would win.And i'm not talking about the nine Mikes.

El primo is like:Finally! I became star player! Or why!?...i dont want to be star player...

I have no star power on mine

**Thanks**

Probably the smartest primo we'll ever see

As long as you accept the consequences. Go for it.

Me, I have none to look forward to as a made a post on a site that doesnt affect anything other than ones own opinion. You dont like it? Then get lost.

gene was being kind yes, i am just giving you example of a tradition you have never heard of. that brock was going to suicide following the tradition. i found you the link of one  i can't please you by finding 50 more.

How you guys do these concept arts and animations :(

Did they have them before?

Fly my pretties
---
Yet the entire time you never said "use this link as you may have better result" instead you came off as an(insert word here) that only badgered me about it being a rule and what not. So excuse me for retaliating to poor words of constructive criticism.
---
it's not as common as teaming itself.  but it's a fairly common thing.
---
Ohhh I got it now!
---
That would definitely add some more flavor to the game/something for the people at the top to grind for... not that I'm there. Only have one lv 9 and no star power, but I like your idea üëç
---
No ,we don't want this. Also supercell don't copy mechanics.
---
Nani
---
yes most people suggested 5 gem tokens in around a month or so, but this guy above says that we should get the tokens within a shorter time. Do you think supercell would realistically do that?
---
Seems fine to me. You crying over nothing boss?
---
This new "exploit" is more a "trick" than a glitch or anything else for me... (I never used it)
---
I'm in the same situation
---
You fucking monster
---
It seems pretty balanced for me... 
---
Do one for NURSE PAM

Ya you right, I'm definitely crying over nothing

Man you nailed those expressions

I can say I got my point across poorly so sorry I can see that my posts might have been seen as just badgering
---
Where's his hat?
---
Wow
---
Imagine needing to aim
---
Just no
---
Pls
---
Just do quests or something if you really want something like this
---
But 
---
Fortnite stuff
---
but he used his super to super farm him
---
I did that before wasn't impressed with big box rewards
---
But you have to time when it bounces in lands, because that‚Äôs the only time it can stick, so it‚Äôs a high skill cap, but a rally god brawler 
---
It is fair. It's about skill not luck.
---
For sure, you out trophied them by how much? Poor guys. Each power level increases power by what, like 5%? OMG crow did 400 per poison dart instead of 380! My poor 8k healthbar! Let's cry about a lower trophy crow being OP!
---
awesome idea but she definitely needs a firefighter hat
---
Even with skill it would be very hard to win in this situation
---
Lol true. I also put a giant Shelley at the top middle
---
Id buy that skin in a heart beat
---
Fair enough

Oof I got all brawlers in 2 months tho iam not complaining

i agree if it just the silven path and the golden path where you have to buy with money unless its with gems but even then 50 is max

It's my little brother's idea. Fun fact: His name is Leon.

Is utilizing a character's abilities to maneuver around obstacles in a PvP game really an exploit? Can piper not use her star power to jump over stuff? Or Darryl with rolling over water til he hits land again? Granted that's not a pvp mode, but it's still using your character's abilities to the best advantage you can
---
Why do cancerous people like you exist?
---
What level are you with Gene?
---
So apparently that recruit doesnt even allow you to post links

Maybe I don‚Äôt want people I know finding my account because they see my username though. Ya know?

Well, it's simply an easy way to win the game, that the developers didn't intend for people to do

Experience lvl 34. For rule 34

5 weeks to get one mega box ?!?

But for free so it might be good

Yes the spawn of box is random

How you made so a new champ

We've been waiting for almost a year

HOLY CROW

Depends on if u pay real money or not

Oh thanks

I see your point but IMO a year and a half old game isn‚Äôt really new but yeah

no star powers

So you are telling me you could get the full reward with those three brawlers?.... 
---
Do not do this it is a bad idea and I will probably stop playing
---
English 100
---
Nice guns.
---
*thinks if i should make one with crow*
---
yeah i really hate when people team with each other in duo like cmon o wait i also have a team oh no oh fu
---
Not fortnite plz
---
I didn't say you team with them, you team with no one cause it's free for all. It says at the start of the game, Every brawler for themselves. And where tf did I say you team with the high power up guy, looks like you need to go back to grade school and learn reading comprehension again.
---
Yeah... even crow, leon and the other won't have the ability (only gunners and brawlers like dynamike or barly)
---
Pretty much like you wouldn't want to use genes super on brawlers like bull, Ash's super would have a few drawbacks too. Else if anyone could light the gas.... every team comp. would have a ash!
---
I don't get it. I don't even have a thumbnail in the vid
---
Duos piper gene/bo
---
First its poco, now its spike!?!?!!?!?!?!?
---
5 weekends? Yikes. I'd say 3 maximum.
---
So many coins! Can I have some good sir?

I hate when they do that. Like maybe the video is interesting but the thumbnail just runs it. Also, you checked the channel?üòÅ

How can I do this glitch?

Tbh looked like a warm up match saw a lot of auto aim from both teams if this is a tournament finals than...
---
U mean Piper. Holy crow
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
wat do you meen?
---
It looks great, but Supercell are not going to consider adding it because the sides of the map are not symmetrical and the matches won't be fair for one of the teams.
---
Holy Spike...?

 I thought the canon would look better on the musket.  :)

---
Why isn't the Star Power the ability to walk over water? I mean, she masters the water.
---
Sorry I should reiterate, don‚Äôt queue into gem grab solo as Darrel, without the right team comp Darrel can easily lose the entire game, just by being unable to create enough *pressure* if the enemy team has any heals 
---
Why does everyone want water in brawl stars? You can't stand on water. Literally only 2 brawlers can use water to their advantage. Why is the community obsessed with water in game!?
---
So star powers?
---
Lol yeah. ‚ÄúMy friend‚Äù
---
Shelly you often need to aim, she has bit of a range. Bull is so close-ranged you just can't go wrong with him.
---
The hitting behind walls sounds OP. Then again, if her attack is weak enough it could be something that makes her unique
---
How many trophies u at?
---
It's real or fake + -
---
holy "NO CROW BUFF"
---
Stop putting water in maps and you might actually see them hit a spotlight.
---
Well...Cavendish Is the third player with the highest amount of trophies in the world

I swear.. i was in school ....

Hehehe ;)

As I've stated the original creator is u/Dandado. My brother wanted me to do it so here it is. There is a total of 284 Fronks in the picture. With 25 in the name. Total time took around an hour.

Just keep calm and don‚Äôt show any challenge.

from what i read, robots wouldn't speed up back then, so mortis could just dash and outrun them
---
I play both Shelly and Bull a lot, and I aim more often with Bull than Shelly. 
---
Same.
---
I'm already 11k with nearly every brawler max, what do I even need them for?

Depends which brawler you have really....if you have crow then you can start praying

what do u mean

No dude that is the best time to grind, you want to be a low level with high trophies. Right now in lvl 98 and I'm at 10,600+ everyone around me in a trophy gap of 300 either direction, is at least 30 levels higher than me.

Oh yeah.

Guys please, we all know that bull is brushing his teeth.

The point of levels is encouraging to keep playing and leveling up your account, and at the same time to make you spend money. SC is a company and you must understand that.
---
So next time you lose, just get over it instead of getting salty, coming to Reddit and crying like a child.
---
I think a rascal would be cooler, but great job!
---
Does this calculator take the changing luck factor into account? If so, does it consider that getting new brawlers decreases your chance of a legendary? I‚Äôm just wondering how the latter could be implemented. I‚Äôd calculate the expected number of brawlers from each category with binomial probability and use that to get the average change in luck, but with something like this the expected number changes every iteration (I‚Äôm assuming that you loop through boxes until all benchmark percentages have been hit) calculating that every iteration would be very inefficient.

Like my post to support crows buff 
---
s i s t e m
---
i'd like to see that ngl
---
Only ones I agree with currently is a Pam Nerf and crow buff. Dynamike definitely doesn't need a health nerf
---
Lol that was good
---
How do you use this symbol without quoting? 
---
If played right he could be good in gg and bounty. For me he's unplayable in showdown
---
Well I couldn‚Äôt find any info on how much the luck changes as you open boxes, so I didn‚Äôt implement that. If you have any of that info It‚Äôd be awesome if you could send it to me.
---
I really didn‚Äôt take efficiency into account really as the computer will only do about 3000 iterations, which is almost instant
---
This is an amazing idea. She could have a hat tho.
---
Yes *DEFINETLY WE NEED IT* !!

---
Stupid concept of having a pass. The reason why other games have a battle pass system is because it is hella successful game where newer players can constantly enjoy playing. A battle system would not make sense dadding because of it's way of playing.

no problem

Then why are u taking this seriously? If it‚Äôs supposedly a joke why does what u say matter?

Bo became a very good choice in gem grab as mid since the las buff. Try putting the mines when the enemy is not seeing you so that they dont know where the mines are. If the other team sees you placing them they can be easy to dodge or deactivate.

There's no need for Emotes. People just get bored of losing 24/7, (*cause they trash*) but still like the concept of the game so they search for extras and add ons to *respark their interest* but even after they buy it it's all the same.

there is no relation of sound here whatsoever yet I can still hear this comment.
---
F2P, but everything I have is 500+. Not all maxed - still missing some power points, gold, spike, and gene. 
---
Yea my bad. 
---
It does
---
You can get to that spot normally
---
Now it happends once on five xD
---
F2P struggles. Gotta get everything I can lol. 
---
Funny thing is that they‚Äôre always putting back that map that‚Äôs not even fixed yet 
---
Then don‚Äôt simple 
---
Just use your super on ground
---
Outstanding move!
---
Yes it ill be realy good
---
This for bull
---
You sure about that...
---
It‚Äôs like the battle pass. The higher tier you are, the man re skins you get
---
Yep
---
That looks too much like shelly
---
It really depends on how many hits she takes on charging super with basic attacks and superattacks. If she can do that like Shelly or Frank then yes.
---
Nice m8  :)
---
If anyone has max mike and you know how to do this exploit message me a friend link
---
It's fairly obvious as he says Here Birdie Birdie Birdie
---
Yay someone else to get to join r/crowgang 
---
It all makes sense now
---
Every brawler at autofires at bull's range exceot for probably throwers. Nothing to be ashamed of
---
All the brawlers are max
---
A b s o l u t e l y
---
*Woah!* It's your **1st Cakeday** deelee23! ^(hug)
---
I think the hole world nows it  
---
‚ÄúAn error occurred‚Äù best video ever
---
It‚Äôs the same for every SC game lol in clash royale i started facing level 13 in hog mountain when i was only level 9/10.
---
At least in brawl stars the difference between each level is only 5% so it‚Äôs still doable to defeat them 
---
Is this the ten tails?
---
Isn't trophy road the battle pass equivalent?  
---
Gem carrier are able to hit multiple targets, and have over 3000 hp. Piper is not a gem carrier, she‚Äôs a support
---
PERFECTION FR√ñNK
---
what is that?
---
They wanna save princess Piper from evil demon Bush Bull??
---
/&gt;Nice
---
Heres how i got bull to 500
---
1. Max out my bull .
---
2.wait for cavern churn
---
3.auto aim 
---
4.dont shoot the boxes( had to learn this the hard way above 400 trophies)
---
5.profit 
---
Darryl never fails to look appetizing.
---
I'd love to see this implemented into the game alongside his Dumpling Counterpart.
---
You don't want to know.
---
You meant wrestling masks
---
How do you type that big
---
Well done but I would make sd B/C definitely not A. Also I would make her sng an even level with bb or maybe worse.
---
Almost 5k only 1 mythic gg
---
With that cannon it‚Äôs more like Jessie
---
Herobrine in the nutshell
---
Yeeeee
---
These are all really great ideas!! 
---
Penny as bossü§î
---
Its not symetrical
---
It ain't honest
---
I think coach cory made a video like 2 weeks ago on it
---
&gt;Finally
---
*fortnite joined chat*
---
My friend got Darryl Rico Pam Piper Frank Mortis Gene Tara and Leon in 2 weeks and he's a f2p 
---
take care of urself
---
I found out that if anyone is above 400 you can watch the replay, I had one a character below 400  because matchmaking gave us a showdown team with a below avg troph and an above avg troph 
---
#LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
may i uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
**j o i n  y o u  p l s**
---
I have no idea
---
Add Tara to the queue if you haven‚Äôt, thanks!
---
Happens to everyone you‚Äôre just unlucky
---
#FIRE HYDRANT
---
At least make challenges like place top 3 in showdown 3 times and not usless ones that takeaway from gameplay 
---
All new brawlers are above super rare
---
-piper (first ever introduced brawler) epic
---
-tara mithic // pam epic
---
-darril superare
---
-penny super rare
---
-FRONK (frank) epic
---
-Leon legendary
---
-gene mithicc
---
You can tell by her voice and how she looks like a kindergardener
---
darryl would be too op 
---
I have the Jessie skin it‚Äôs the best skin ever 
---
jeez relax
---
I‚Äôm talking about the power, lvl 10 vs lvl 6
---
(.3.) look at it upside down 
---
Lmao i followed the thread
---
Lol nice, you like the MEME
---
In the pic themselves she is made to look older m8
---
I FOUND THE SAUCE
---
How do you have so much coins
---
yup we need new RARE brawler
---
Source? 
---
r/Fronkgang
---
Do u need it?
---
Boi, where y think I got it from 
---
It was very good, which app did you use to do it?
---
Shhhh
---
"Graphic"
---
The FBI is waiting...
---
Good concept just don't want it to look like poco that much.
---
Personally the skin doesn't look good but I'm upvoting for using the term "Aleon" XD
---
I feel stupid now nvm
---
Hmm... I wonder where did that name come fromü§î
---
What? It‚Äôs simply just better to auto aim as bull, and that‚Äôs a fact that you can‚Äôt change lol. Sounds like you‚Äôre just salty for being killed by so many of them. ( f in the chat for DEADHEAVEN007)
---
What if it took 20 gem tokens but it didn‚Äôt run out and you got one for getting past the 20 normal token limit
---
Crow does need a buff, in my opinion. Even just more toxic damage would be great.
---
The // means that both brawlers were added at the same update
---
Amazing skin!!! 
---
Saw that, it was a true tragedy
---
Your name is Poco4Life so why do you have a crow flair?
---
It‚Äôs time for a fucking crusade 
---
Oh hey giorno :)
---
FBI
---
I would hate the battle pass if it costs real money. Then it would just take out the f2p element of the game. 
---
Do you think it's fair for me to make spicy memes and get called that
---
Bcs, i joined the holy crow rebelition
---
I don't use them
---
Absolutely not
---
No fbi, she is 18 in drawing
---
U deserve better
---
Oh, then ill try to save for one of them. Last time I had one was 2 weeks ago, so if im correct I may be abke to get a legendary in two weeks.
---
Bitch lasagna 
---
gg
---
üëàüòéüëà Heya frosty
---
Wow brawl stars has so much r34
---
It nice ain't it
---
I love how that colt knew he wasn‚Äôt going to land a shot on you so he finished off the Spike out of desperation 
---
Absolutely üëåüí¶üíØ
---
The left guy has the best idea...
---
Daryll Heaven 
---
Crow next? Yes please
---
SPIKE IN REAL LIFE!!! (NOT CLICKBAIT) (GONE WRONG) ( GONE SEXUAL)
---
We need more Poco skin ideas 
---
Hell naw, I didn't spend any money on mobile games yet, I don't really wanna change it.
---
Is this already available in Burger King?
---
The cannon should be a mortar
---
You will be missed! (Not really, just for throwersüòÇ)
---
Haters will say fake
---
bAda BAP bEp
---
Wow. Spike, nice. (In my head) LETS GOOOOOOOO
---
Lesson: Gene super doesn't go with person with a ball
---
Pipe 'em!
---
I reported you for spamming that on every single post...
---
Just messing around trying to be funny
---
Fake
---
what was it? Someone give me the link
---
September brawl talk but all beta videos are UNLISTED so I have to find link again 
---
Wait a minute 
---
I seriously live the skin though. Funny, but awesome
---
Looks cool. But too crowded. Maybe remove some obstacles
---
Spike is op, you just play him wrongly. He is ment to be a support not a tank or an assassin. Also his damage is very high
---
r/foundthelightmodeuser 
---
You want to know what i REALLY think? If someone teams, and you report(have to add this first) them they lose their trophies that have earned for a match if they lose they lose trophies too OR BRING BACK LIFE LEECH NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS even there can be teamers and I team too like everyone, even today cause i had -150 primo and made it to -30 on Brawl ball, my teammates had to go soooooo.... Showdown and this was big thing

Rico before menopause.

I feel bad for your ruined name...
---
Whats the dynamike trick?
---
Idk I still think piper and frank are worse but yeah he‚Äôs definitely near the bottom
---
How is this relevant to the conversation?
---
looks like you are offline  that is why sometimes when you invite someone he said offline
---
Me too  i saw him on brawl ball a week ago
---
More damage, or hp
---
Sadly lmao

Very very cool

Did you say the *n-word*?
---
Tfw when 1000 dollars is considered "almost nothing" in a F2P game
---
It is one of the reasons yes
---
This is why Rico became Thicco
---
*shoots teammates to make them move*
---
Except that the clash royale tournament system is shit, it only uses the worse parts of the battle pass system, you have a limited amount of losses to get enough wins to get the best rewards.
---
If I‚Äôm gonna be paying for a battle pass here I want the Fortnite model, when once you buy it you have all the time in the world (before season ends though) to complete your challenges and earn all of the rewards
---
Just make an entry or two at the bottom and at the top and it'll be great. 
---
Right now it'll take too much time for the little ones.
