You‚Äôre a moron. Kill stealing is pure luck. And I‚Äôm acutely aware of what rng is. If you think lone star takes skill, please stick to lone star so you don‚Äôt poison 3v3s with your ‚Äúskills‚Äù. Moron.

Nice idea! Just some things I noticed: 
---
His super -  it's like a Darryl roll that can break through walls, AND you get to control him during the roll. Think this needs to be reworked to make less OP. Also, his star powers seem really OP too depending on the range of them.

Rule 5. Repetitive or low effort posts with a low discussion potential will be removed.
---
The pupil is totally gone for me. Showdown is the only good solo mode (includes life leech) the other modes just aren‚Äôt fun. In lone star you always get kills stolen and in takedown you can‚Äôt land any hits on the boss.
---
Rule 2. All contents must be directly related to Brawl Stars.

---
Yeah, he was directly nerfed. Watch an old old brawlstars video and look at how long his range is.
---
Oh
---
Going over to the club to cuss him out was not a good idea.  At the end of the day you never gain anything out of it.  It's understandable that supercell bans people who cuss seeing as this is a kids game.  Unfortunately, this one is on you despite how the random scored on his own goal.

this is so relatble bc i can't really show that i don't wanna kill my opponents just kill the robot. I can't spin bc it'll look like im trying to team, and i try to sorta "show" that im ignoring them by not shooting at em, but ofc it NEVER works.

Never thought I would see a reference to life of a wimpy kid here, well done!
---
So why are you showing two modes that don‚Äôt exist and maps for the two that do that were removed from rotation?
---
Aside from that, Lone Star is kind of based on luck but Takedown isn‚Äôt luck-based any more than Showdown is. What the modes need is to be reworked.
---
For example, Takedown could change so that the boss will never run more than, say, 30 tiles from the center of the map, and respawns occur 30 tiles from spawn, placing you at a bubble location with a minimum distance from the boss of 15 tiles, maximum of 30. Lone Star could be extended to 2:30 and be given Showdown gas that, by the 30 seconds mark, has closed the area to 30x30.

O mah gush he looks so cute!

Yeah this is big brain time

2 days ago it was critical crossing for both showdown and power play

lol
---
as long as colts hands in that pic?
---
I am not saying you ksing other people. I mean what if you hit all your shots then you get ksed?
---
Seems logic I guess
---
Both of those game modes are absolute trash in their current forms.  
---
Maps should be smaller, respawns should be instant... even then I‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôd be fun, but it‚Äôs a step in the right direction.

Idk, i don't have a really good wifi and still never face any lag

I feel like the most versatile one is extra toxic (nerf extra toxic crow), the worst is probably, I don't know, magic puffs, dyna jump is one of the best if you are skilled, da capo is the best if you have friends ;-;, those are just my opinion of them based on others reactions and my own uses of them.

Owo

You also need some strategy tho

man this aint funny, dont trash the sub with this shit

Can you do that with no freinds and no solos as a f2p, I think not but I am doing that.
---
I want that skin so damn bad
---
Poco looks dead he doesn‚Äôt have a soul anymore

The hard part is getting kills without getting ksed though. And it is definitely not the least skilled gamemode. All 3v3 modes are definitely the least skilled modes

nah just

After today I wow not to play any of the lonestar games ever - be it powerplay or not - that particular mode keeps me feeling totally miserable winning or not. Games shouldnt have such an effect on an adult man
---
Ok actually i wont pay a dime on anything the game offers unless lonestar is removed at least from powerplay. Its a win/win , I save money and my mental health
---
Hahaha cant stop laughing
---
Yeah but the guy clearly didn't do that because then he'd be having a Gem Grab or BB montage with or at least the final match as a clip. He just pushed him in SD like every other rank 35 Colt so he basically is telling the sub he has a lot of time. At least the obsidian badge is going to be there forever.

That's just an assumption tho. Making a clip like that would also mean he has a whole lot more time.

By this logic,every gamemode except Solo Showdown should be removed. All the rest are luck based because they are team-based and,if you're not playing with friends or a pre-made team,you'll probably get some a-hole players who have no idea what to do.

Pulling some plays at this amount of trophies isnt even impressive cause most of the enemies are just not good

---
You were very helpful i did it and now I can easily push them all
---

---
It's an achievement for me, because at the end of December my phone broke and I didn't play for a few Months.
---
Obviously I thought everyone knew that
---
Agreed! The shape reminds me of a building from Aladdin lol
---

You should go play on your mini now

---

---
I am so overpowered... At photos!

It means they chose random brawler for every match
---
Duo lonestar and takedown!??! Am I dumb or something??

Today I only lost with Bo

That doesn‚Äôt require a buff. That requires people to stop playing her in other modesüòÇ

Clean your phone screen you dumba**

That might fix it, or tell your parents to get you a new device or wait, they are to poor to afford one!

Does Supercell consider ideas mentioned on r/Brawlstars (e.g. 3rd star powers, new game modes etc.)?
---
How many trophies do you have ?
---
Just play 3 v 3 mode for Star Token + push trophies in SD, LS and TD :)
---
And also training cave
---
How are you ?

The dynamiek star power concept is actually good!

This meme has been done so many times its just annoying now. I wish people were more original and came up with there own memes. It's just repost after repost on this sub
---
But NP since u didn't knew about that :)
---
that true :'(
---
NANI? also nice art
---
Note: For some reason, I was unable to attach the photos displaying Bo's research, so if you are seriously interested in where I got those numbers, then don't hesitate to reach out to me! I also attempted to post this on my main account, but the Bot automatically took it down. Rip.

Where is Mortis on the buff changes?

At least have your post not be 144p lmao what kind of quality is this
---
ya but the original character does not have curves like that, she almost looks like a kid. 
---
she barely has a chest, so i don‚Äôt agree with your logic but ok w/e lol
---
Why are you proud? ü§£ü§£ü§£

It kinda looks like a building from red square in Russia which would kind of tie in with Christmas since russia is typically very snowy
---
Do you expect us to love this post? It might be your first post but this isn‚Äôt great. No offense.

You said 5, but pic said 4.

Good idea

Ouch, light mode! It hurts!!

If you have enough gems, buy it.

Again Cato with amazing editing (:

I would 100% buy that!

I hit ur comment to 1000 upvotes

Quality post...
---
how do you make a brawler skin idea?
---
Don't feel sorry. He did this to himself. All 3 of them were in the same room. It's impossible to get random teammates with that amount trophies when you're at 500.
---
Rare: Barley
---
Super Rare: Rico
---
Epic: Piper
---
Legendary: no legendary yet
---
Star Power: magnum special
---
Oh and sorry theres no ig music, I usually listen to my own
---
Thanks man!
---
Jessie buff is good, but then she will be too op, so i would nerf her attack speed to a medieum between this one and the last one.
---
Piper is in a pretty good place rn, and i would defenitely NOT buff snappy sniping, it is one of the most balanced sp in the game rn, i would buff het overal damage a little bit and nerf her ambush, but not too much
---
Poco is one of the best brawler in the game rn, i would nerf his da capo from 800 to 600, and thrn you can maybe buff his attack damage, but not too much
---
Bo is a tricky brawler, he has really good stats, but he just isnt tot crazy good, defenitely not in the competitive meta, i dont know about this one, maybe a little smaller attack radius, less spread and maybe nerf his sp vision, but it isnt so op, But from 5 tiles to 4 tiles would maybe be a good nerf. Aboit his other sp, i totally agree, nerf it from 2 sec to 0.5, but let it stack (if 2 mines hit you, you are stunned for 1 sec, if you are hit with 3 you are stunned for 1.5 sec), or nerf it to 1 sec
---
8-bit is indead really good right now but it is not because of his 2nd life, it can be nerfed once again, but he will still be really good, in showdown too, i would nerf his attack damage
---
Darryl is wayy to op right now, but he is a assasin, so i would definitely not nerf his movement speed, but i would nerf his hp, and maybe his attack
---
I agree with the maps, and i know that supercell showdown: does look at new maps frequently, cavern churn isnt removed, its a bug, anf i do agree with the modifiers
---
Gem gram: the gem grab matches are about the same lenght as other games, so its balanced, i dont agree with that
---
Takedown and lone star: lonestar is really balanced right now, so it is not necessary to change the trophies and i dont play takedown, only for star key, so i dont know about that
---
Legendary brawlers: i am playing since beta launch, and i only need sandy, but i got my first leggy brawler at 7k, and my first mythic at 9k, but eventhough i am really unlucky with brawlers and star powers, i think it is really balanced, and i wouldnt change it. compared to other supercell games it is really easy to max your account.
---
See you in hot. I am glad you posted again.
---
That's not matchmakings fault
---
No :(
---
okay, But can You tell me some tips, to get mote power points?
---
Congratulationsüéâüéâüéâüéâüéâ! Keep me updated please.
---
Are the mods even active in this sub anymore? I‚Äôve seen so many low effort posts on the sub and they don‚Äôt take it down.
---
I think you need to get your eyes checked because you don‚Äôt know how long Darryl‚Äôs roll goes for and I already know what causes Darryl‚Äôs roll to happen. I know for a fact why it happened because it has happened a few times to me.
---
Also, if you wanna say there‚Äôs nothing wrong about it, then fine, but don‚Äôt you be calling people noobs just because they ‚Äúauto-aim‚Äù. Maybe you do it as well, so don‚Äôt be so hypocritical about auto-aim and just don‚Äôt treat others like that. 
---
Like seriously, I bet you that even Lex and Kairos auto-aim. Ask ANY Brawl Stars YouTubers and they‚Äôll say they auto-aim most of the time, but not every time.
---
So watch what you send because I will not hesitate to write up something like this.
---
Btw, there are two rolls that happened in the replay, not one so watch the **WHOLE ENTIRE** video before you comment on anything
---
Good math. 30/30=3/3. Good use of ratios
---
How about Sandy? He's legendary too. But he can't type Sandy in his nickname because of max. character input is 15.
---
I think he wants one of them.

SC designs this game for beginners. Bc they can make money off them. When you max your account SC is done with you. They don‚Äôt care about you. I‚Äôm so sick and tired of this game. I‚Äôm a maxed account trophy 20K and I‚Äôm quitting this game. It‚Äôs boring af. Now that I maxed my account SC can‚Äôt make money off me anymore so they just focus on the beginners. Age range in this game is 7years old-11. This game is garbage now. I‚Äôm quitting. After playing everyday for over 1 year, I haven‚Äôt played in a week. Playing MarioKart now and it‚Äôs a lot of fun. I hate Supercell I hate everyone that works at Supercell. I hate the devs. I hope they all get hit by bus for wasting my time for 1 year for nothing. This game sucks now
---
Not probably, he IS the most annoying thrower
---
I think I‚Äôm going to abort :(
---
Barley or darryl
---
And in spanish it's a female tiger
---
That's not possible because it takes too much data/space if you know what I mean.
---
Collect all tokens everyday and save your coins to level him up, that‚Äôs basically it.
---
Lol in romanian

#RELOAD PUNCHES
---
Better star power she now instead of bulble she now trows her bat (range same as Carl attack) damage 1400 and it will heal 350hp per hit
---
Brawl ball was up with an open map. Shes really good even without her being max
---
Some of these could be ordered differently tbh
---
I made a post that said to get rid of lone star so play the rick and morty meme, you son of a bitch I‚Äôm in
---
I miss power points for 4 brawlers, I can max out the other 14 while ten are lvl 9/10, gold is never enough bro :(
---
It still 10k more money that i have right now XD
---
Over 2 minutes it was bad...

I am not good enough with Leon to get trophies from lone star
---
You are probably 11/12 years old, not older. Your grammar is very bad, and you watch all populair dutch youtubers. (Kids around your age watch these vids), so stop doing like you are so good. Bet you don't even have 10K trophies.

thanks! glad you like it

Thank you!

hate random

I think this bug is on everyone‚Äôs device. Just brought it up. The auto clicker would have to be insanely fast too
---
I have an idea, players who have more than 11500 cups if a legendary will be given one for free on the trophy road
---
You right, it's just my opinion and you can do whatever you want with your ideas. Good luck

I'm a man of law,not a priest.my cause is just,and that's to keep reddit free of emojis

Yeah

Bruce‚Äôs icon should be angry when he is attacking someone.

Thank you very much.

I have power points for every brawler i have and the minimum i get is around 46 gold and the maximum i remember is 130

Its okay to say your own criticism. That‚Äôs what the comments are for. But at least be supportive.

Um...OkayüòÇ
---
you read my comment? i said, ‚Äò‚Äô have alredy a heal star power‚Äô‚Äô because she‚Äôll have 2 star powers that heal, i prefer the other one who slow enemies
---
That is a bad brawler idea, way too much range, health, and damage, and no clear weaknesses
---
My friend got 2 legendarys in one day i i have non 
---
His trophies:6100
---
My trophies:10000
---
I like having solo showdown in there because most of the time i have to rely on randoms on the 3v3s which half of the time is good and half is bad
