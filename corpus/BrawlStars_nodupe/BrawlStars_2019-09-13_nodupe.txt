Im piper main and was sniper main in other games. 100% agreed. I'd love if sniper never existed in games. But weirdly enough I can play only as sniper :/
---
I got gene at 2789 trophies
---
Definitely better than demolition if you can master it.
---
I‚Äôm so sick of this ‚Äúbad randoms‚Äù crap. Are there cases where there are bad randoms? Yes. But if you‚Äôre not able to win at least 50% of your games with randoms, you‚Äôre the problem, not them. And until you get to 700, winning 50% is all you need to advance. Slowly, yes. I pretty much exclusively play with randoms or solo and I never have any trouble pushing all 28 of my brawlers to 700+ each season.

Keep doing a goo work like this and maybe supercell uses one of yoir skins in the game

lol nice catch XD

They didn't.

Weird! I‚Äôve never been VP so I guess I don‚Äôt know.

If you have not already, join r/brawlstarscompetitive

There are some pretty good guides and tips on there
---
In brawl stars, it is not efficient to push one brawler a lot, make sure to push all of your brawlers 
---
Other than that, just make sure to play every day or so to get your star tokens for big boxes, and tokens for normal boxes
---
Enjoy!

To be fair, nothing survives a full health el primo jumping on them anyway
---
I survived with 1 hp
---
Keep practicing and get that timing down
---
Yea i thought that too, but i've seen enough crows trying to kill shotgunners close range, also pipers who try to kill others close range, or dynamikes who try to kill others close range, at 500 and up, most know how to play their brawler, but not always, i once played duo sd with a randome dynamike and he run to an enemy leon and tried to kill him on close range, he didn't do any damage to him and died (this dynamike was on 750 trophies)

Chinese New Year is in like February lmao.
---
Have you tried turning it off, and on again?
---
Your fuckinf brawler is the same trophy as his mortis what‚Äôs the problem
---
I‚Äôve had exactly one loss that was my fault. All of the rest were bad randoms. Also. That‚Äôs sarcasm. But that‚Äôs the way we all think. It‚Äôs never our fault. ‚ÄúBad randoms‚Äù definitely exist. But often the things we blame on bad randoms are just really bad team comps, bad matching of play styles, or simply losing to a better team. Trust me. I get it. But the bad random thing is really not the only issue here.
---
What is the N word
---
15for skin color 10  for affect 80 for the wheel and hands 45 for set
---
It is. U dumbass they have no choice but to put them with u cause they are so many trash ppl that can‚Äôt even reach 800
---
I once survived at 1hp
---
It is fuckinf TRUE!!!
---
Maybe because the super landed at the same time Morris dashed and he dashed through it maybe ? Idk
---
Goodness!
---
That's skills with Shelly
---
*Thumbs up*
---
Why is curve ball rank 1 it‚Äôs so good it‚Äôs like rank 35
---
Oh wait I looked closely and they are bushes lol sorry
---
The idea is COMPLETELY EPIC but I think the main attack is too similar to Bo's attack, so maybe change that a bit?
---
When you don't have alive
---
Stfu be grateful with what you have u have so many brawlers you are Super lucky
---
This was a show of skills, I have dodge 2 Piper's at once, but this guy was dodging multiple shots from the whole map.
---
Would definitely buy if I could
---
Brock before rocket no. 4 existed
---
This is ez now the challenge is like level 1 at 700
---
This was all skill... absolutely.
---
#stopthespin...not apin
---
Honestly I feel bad for them, cause they're trying their best and listening to us and all we do is complain.
---
Everywhere I look, I see his face
---
80 Gems.
---
Yes but as a noob Piper I did this at close range
---
14.5 k is probably garbage to the top and players I suppose
---
If they're siblings, why is Hessie looking straight at Colt's chest?
---
Well hello there brother, I'm another winner, mind if we play sometime???
---
Just stop u gonna regret
---
Piper has teeth??
---
Wowwwww
---
That's crazy XD
---
When my friend told me Rockabilly Mortis was 39 gems, I thought she was lying because I thought the lowest it can go is 69 for a 150 gem skin, but when I got on reddit, literally everyone was talking about this so now i know this is true

Only for 1200$

Really unique! But I wonder how balanced it would be

Yes ur right, but it's better if the game have no bugs
---
nah he has powerpoint offers in the shop
---
I like the tenth

Lol

Does piper + poco = go together?
---
Don't forget a pirate, a bird, a Frankenstein‚Äôs monster, a walking arcade, a walking cactus, a walking barrel, a Mexican Day of the Dead skeleton, a bartender, a Minecraft kid, and a bouncy ball machine.
---
The ‚Äúbridges‚Äù on the left and ride side of the map are wayyyyy too narrow if you ask me, you should make them at least 3 tiles wide so it doesn‚Äôt become a huge choke point

Its much easier now with new throphies system
---
Now u have a negative karma score so remove your comment
---
Dude. You were literally within 5 tiles of range meaning your attacks would never miss. You had the power advantage. You had your Super. You had snappy sniping. You were just auto-aiming the whole time.... as much as I respect your post this is not an outplay or a play of any sort, it‚Äôs just auto-aim
---
nice
---
Your fate has been decided... no legendaries out of your mega boxes
---
Congratulations:)
---
So in short, you killed everybody
---
Why didn‚Äôt you just say that

It‚Äôs not only balanced; it is THE balance.

How could he possibly think that firing with THAT angle that it would end up in the goal ? Lmao
---
no i watched a minecraft yt which has a series called what if
---
If kills gaved you trophies...
---
Yeah, 8-bit just plays with himself
---
all three are perfectly balanced. bo and colt are good in showdown because of their damage output and range. spike is not that great against long range brawlers on open map, but he's really good in 3v3. in this video, the OP us a really good spike, he didn't miss most of his shots

Hey! What‚Äôs up Ryan

I can't change my name so.

Yo that account is gonna get banned

not funny
---
overused

but atleast not 6969 trophies
---
The hoodie is kinda creepy
---
selling/giving out accounts is against supercell terms of service
---
She already snipes at long range - her shield would never go up. She already has a super that allows her to evade close range combat.
---
Its better than the blue tara Skin!!
---
yeah thats what i thought
---
Hi, I got a new bug since this update. Left part of the touch screen dedicated to the movements, catch some times the shoot action and block it to the left. It becomes unplayable. I have a xiaomi redmi 3 mobile phone. Thanks for your attention.
---
"looking to protect yourself?"
---
"or deal some damage?"
---
I posted the picture becuase I hit 14.5k not the 69 tickets.. it was a joke lol
---
No, well imagine his super did damage and destroyed walls without a star power, but it didn't heal, and you know how big his super is, so he was damn op
---
When you started playing
---
Stealing? Who?  me?
---
I posted the pic becuase of the trophies.. ive never been so high.. and i titled it like that too make it a joke..
---
What use is a sniper that's unable to shoot? Its more like a big nerf for a tiny buff.
---
Just like with brawl ball.Everyone wanted BB,but after this changes all the kids are complaining again.I think they complain beacuze they don't have anything better to do
---
Yeah then it could be a good idea
---
Did this with spike as well
---
i am the worst random
---
Maybe the random disconnect and a bit took his place
---
I don't like Robo Rumble at all so if they removed it temporarily (like they did to boss fight) im ok with that btw i think you are right they removed it
---
He quit so bot replace him. But yeah maybe that how he normal is. You know RANDOM.
---
What in the CHRIST!?!
---
What did u do
---
That makes me happyüòÑ
---
I don't have Mortis ü•∫
---
~~i just suck at the game lmao~~
---
No
---
No totally better 2nd in 3v3 and ofc sd
---
When is the brawl talk?
---
Bruh mortis's legit looks fucking dead (nice artwork)
---
Nice draw bro. Good story too.
---
no
---
No. They should be tortured and then get dumped in a pit of fire
---
I like the idea it could be a real thing tho
---
I bought Jessie, Dyna, Ricos, Nita, Barley, Spike, Poco skins for 150 and they were released at a discount
---
The german guy is the noob. He is the one who is unskilled so he is calling barley bad. There will be a brawler what each person prefer btw barley is a good brawler definitely.
---
Love it
---
Great job!  Keep em coming, you have quite the talent
---
A good ol look at beta brawl stars
---
well done! how about making your way to 10000 next.
---
Haha go ahead mate, I‚Äôm not stressing. Have a nice day!
---
every little spike is really on point
---
U just mad
---
I........... AM.............. NOT........... WEAK
---
Already got nightwitch mortis

Omg pls stop with these posts!! I have seen more than 50 today!

How the fuck did u find this meme

It's Crazy
---
Noktuska changed man..

They are all so accurate man I love it!

This needs more upvotes
---
If u know how to play with Mortis he is op,my most dislike brawler is elprimo in showdown
---
*I'm Kid*
---
Randoms are the worst in 3v3 modes you already know when you're gonna lose if both your teammates are afk
---
It increases every 40 boxes, not every single one.
---
I just hate Mortis even if I play him like a pro
---
True!!
---
Kids like to feel entitled lmao
---
Banidita shelly
---
They didn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs just on sale
---
I'm realy impressed man :O
---
Oh okay thanks! 40 normal boxes or only the big boxes?
---
They said that the only ‚Äúexclusive skins‚Äù were star Shelly and wizard barley. This means that the winter skins may also come back.
---
She is a Wild West character haha
---
40 normal
---
the same happened to me except i got spike and crow within a week and not 3 days
---
still good job man

dafuq is wrong with those people

10 more Brock skins pls!

Why are you showing us how this app works?
---
Guess so
---
+2 star skins
---
How? Is this fake? Players didn't kill each other?
---
I got 20 gems from this box
---
It‚Äôs not
---
This fake
---
It is mid autumn festival so they released again it will be gone in 3 days so it is still limited
---
There is already a map calle spring trap (gem grab)
---
U have good shot doesn't mean u will win, secondly wouldn't it encourage players for playing for aggressive more rather that camping to get ranks for trophies
---
el primo points to where you shouldn't click
---
True
---
I am so jealousüëÄ I opened like, thousands of crates and got no legendaries. I'm at 8k
---
No you're the only one in the world.
---
Nah I prefer piper and Mortis to primo üòÇ
---
If you have really good wi-fi it's harder to do

No it was amazing u just suck
---
Weekend by Supercell
---
It‚Äôs in rotation for 3 weeks u dumbass next week is robo rumble
---
trophy buff, star points, 2 free brawlers, star skins, big box and mega box with star points offer every season end
---
Maan plays 3 legendaries to unlock
---
Plus*
---
Copied
---
Most probably. Leon just seems like a really OP brawler and even in the hands of a newbie he's pretty decent
---
Today i battle with 8 rockabilly mortises
---
This is just his opinion, but yes da capo is useless in solo
---
band aid is fair and balanced
---
~~just like random crits in tf2~~
---
And that's without his SP yet
---
You cant have luck if there is no rng involved. Is not hard to understand
---
Oh oh no my eyes
---
Taunting that Primo like "SPIN NOW, MOFO"
---
F, what Happened?
---
No they should bring back thousand lakes
---
And my friends say Spike is useless
---
neither does nita
---
Gemmer
---
I think the classic is a girl...
---
How do you get that brawler icon next to your name
---
 it didn‚Äôt say 2018 mid autumn event is lunar
---
Wait that means he has legit two brains
---
U don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs lunar I guess
---
It doesn‚Äôt have to be Chinese New Year to be lunar
---
Bull
---
U are very lucky in getting brawlers and u should not complain

Ah yes which map
---
There's a ton of teaming, you can get easily cornered, meteors always target you, I mean, that map just sucks.
---
Robo rumble
---
got banned cause i said null's brawl private... you now the rest it may be my fault but i didn't knew that it will lead me to a ban
---
Now this is big brain time
---
Where exactly?
---
Didn't know Colt had a new skin.
---
Ok!!
---
Not on normal matches.. if they release something like a ranked that would be ok but i dont want to talk with these russian/arabic or whatever randoms that cant even speak english
---
And that s a fact
---
i knew someone would say it
---
Where?
---
BUY THAT COLT SKIN!!!!!!!!
---
I'm sorry :(
---
In all 74 robo rumble maps but after global release they removed it
---
Fbi open up
---
New currency that you get from the season reset and from ranking up in the 10-15-20-25-30-35 ranks and with that you can buy skins (in the star shop) and boxes (only the day after the season reset and as a special offer)
---
oh i see tgx for telling me
---
Just saying, that's what's on all the other Lunar Brawl skins
---
Same.
---
K good to know. I meant in every gamemode could be useful
---
Yes it was
---
Because the Trophy Road and Epic fanart were drawn later than Rare fanart
---
What app is that?
---

He has everything on video and the kill feed to prove it, you are probably just salty about it not being you
---
Soo true with 8-bit :&gt;
---
when did you start playing brawl stars
---
Haha username checks out
---
Pathetic that you had to resort to upvoting your own comments cuz they were negative
---
No its not. Actually 500 is too little.
---
gUys iM a bEta tEsteR
---
Agreed except :
---
- frank is fine as he is. Maybe animation speed slowed slightly
---
- Pam is still OP. No need to buff her
---
- 8bit. Reduce invincibility but not take off. Otherwise a shelly will just wait on his body and double spam attack or super, making his star power useless. Maybe 1 sec invincibility where he can't attack.
---
the silhouette looks like a frickin transformer
---
It‚Äôs not going into rotation. Just the Moon Festival aka Mid-Autumn Festival (yummy moon üåö cakes üç∞), and the Spring Festival aka Chinese New Years.

Buy it now or wait another year. I bought it proudly. For I‚Äôm BagBoon Proudfeet of the ProudDingus clan.

Star shelly. That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm also a beta tester. Like a fifth of the players are beta testers.
---
I do
---
Looks like a cute lil helmet
---
oh nice
---
Omg what is ur problem? you need calm down you lifeless shit lol
---
That's really hard to pull of...if this is what you mean, I think the DPS should be 750-1500 depending on the radius of the cloud
---
They did put agent colt back in despite being a Chinese New Year exclusive.
---
But why still win
---
Bruh get your head out your ass and try playing agianst 9 teaming 8-bit in showdown while you're Mortis. And those shots are hard to dodge, Espeon if the dude aims it. He can take out an entire seige turret ON HIS OWN. Dude can gun down almost every other brawler so don't even TRY to approach him, he has the same health as Pam and more dps than COLT. Guy even outranges him with magnum special so that's always a bad matchup, and his speed hardly affects anything! Dude needs a hard ass nerf.
---
must be icearrow
---
y'know, the guy that made [blet]
---
He really does, he has way too much range and the last buff was unneeded to begin with
---
And NO, another crow buff would be at the same level of stupidity as that poco buff in beta and pre neraf Rosa
---
Hits blunt.
---
2007 year
---
But the other star power is way better
---
I have it in my shop too. What‚Äôs so good about it? Looks meh to me

I‚Äôm not sure if u realised this but lunar and Christmas skins use to say ‚Äú2018 brawlidays skin‚Äù or ‚Äú2018 lunar skin‚Äù or something like that, now they removed the ‚Äú2018‚Äù part. Assuming they will bring them back.
---
Someone already did this but different words
---
What makes you think that?
---
Crow is barely balanced as is
---
I‚Äôll buy it when it comes on sale for 39. It‚Äôs not a complete remodel so not 80 gems here. I just bought Agent Colt and am still going through a drought after buying all the other skins on sale. Now have 400 gems left and waiting for October‚Äôs new brawler. So nah I‚Äôll pass. 
---
It looks cool but summers over - even in Africa üåç where I live.
---
Actually, all beta testers give a skin on Leon!
---
I just saw that they downvoted me. Why are people so easily triggered here? Lmao
---
Got spike at 3k lol
---
THATS A DOWNVOTE FOR ME CRITICAL CROSSING IS AN EPIC MAP DONT REMOVE IT (cuz i need it to push my crow)
---
Nah. This one is better
---
So hardcore. Not like my trophies r more than double than urs
---
maybe. but I have them except colt.
---
Bruh it was limited
---
Well then here's a tip: learn how to play them. And wtf do you mean that Leon is bad? You're the one guy calling good brawlers bad.
---
Why would you even buy a skin in the first place? They are just a waste of gems
---
You never saw me playing Leon ;)
---
Bad luck, ur missing one legendary
---
are you asian?
---
Nice looks like you're a man of culture as well
---
Bruh I mean yes he can destroy a siege turret but still he is pretty bad if you actually play with him it will be a pain to push him to 500 and take a chill pill
---
Soz I didn‚Äôt realise they added colt back in, haven‚Äôt played bs much in past week coz no motivation to play.
---
r/whoosh
---
Well I got Leon when I closed the sound I just find that the sounds is soo nice
---
El bruh momento
---
I think they should bring back an old map I don‚Äôt remember the name but it was a circle of bushes for bull and Shelly but it was fun
---
Where did u find this
---
Tell your mom to get a job
---
Pam's # T H I C C
---
Yeah, it is good. But it's not like I got it for free I spent gems on that. The same way someone could spend gems to get a high chance of getting a brawler through mega boxes that give u the reward instantly or not trying to get a brawler and focusing on skins. It's still fair in the end because you're spending valuable gems on it. What's Ur point
---
Yup, these are Ryan and Dani‚Äôs evil clones.
---
Well Coach Cory Made a Community Post about this also..
---
So It might be real
---
ok, thanks!
---
Piper time
---
I use the spin to destroy the spin
---
I only have 8bit, 1 epic, 2 mythics and three legys to go. Not that you care or anything.
---
&gt;:3
---
Or a super modifier, and assists...
---
Bruh it‚Äôs a joke
---
Yes I remember that heist map... Looks weird to me at first
---
Either Jessie‚Äôs butt was too big and squished poor Scrappy or recycled materials are squishy in the first place
---
Duuuuude i messed up my post I don‚Äôt know how ! If you could read it, or still have the page open can you copy everything and sent me somewhere ???

And yeah, same for me, when I tought about these I really wanted to play those game modes !

That's BADASS dude !!!

Then why does he have an upvote
---
Thx for information
---
What about male brawlers?
---
Where did you get the photo
---
That's not a milestone anymore
---
this is very shotgunner oriented
---
Jessie is 11 tho
---
Mmmm, yum, mango boi
---
the brawl ball idea is good but i'd do "most kills" for bounty. also the graphic isn't that good
---
Has every brawler except legendaries ü§î, I belong here
---
Thanks :)
---
Yesss
---
non √® italiano queto server
---
Thanks! Didn't know I needed this!
---
Oh my God! I love this!
---
not anymore, i guess? it WAS an exclusive skin back when that first event happened (unless there was some other time where we got a chance to get it again, and if that's the case i might've just been living under a rock)
---
Poco i got a bone to pick with ya
---
Oooof i got screen time too...
---
No offense but this star power would be one of the worst ones in the game.
---
I don't really play solo showdown at high trophies only play with my 8bit in solo but judging from the comments it seems there is a lot of teaming going on in this map. Passage was removed for the same reason.
---
Wait op was ant Jesse like 12
---
Lmao
---
Lmao, see you on hot maybe
---
Rank 20 Nita at nearly 4k?
---
I'm 11k and my Nita is just Rank 15 lmao
---
German again,...? I am seeing a lot of german dudes in here recently...
---
Bull is obviously Best hoy but what about best robot
---
It is re-started to sale for 2 days. Cuz Sep 13-15 is one of Korean‚Äôs big national holiday, and Royal Agent skin was released to celebrate lunar brawl with Korean‚Äôs traditional clothes at last February.
---
Great idea, if only Exp was more useful than just providing extra tokens now and then
---
Of course. I never think of myself as a good player. Also how is this relevant?
---
No it wasn‚Äôt
---
Let me quote a artist ‚Äúage is just a number ‚Äú
---
Happened to me too
---
Yeah some of it are really fun to play in
---
So you're a great mortis player
---
it is a coincidence
---
We need one at 14500
---
The bigger issue is having teammates with 700 trophies that are pretty terrible, only to find out their overall trophies are 4k ~8k. 
---
This problem existed before, but was made significantly worse with the new trophy system. The fact that the ratio of gaining/losing trophies is greater than 50:50 means that with enough time and luck, anyone can get to 700+. 
---
It‚Äôs very noticeable when a player has one high-trophy brawler while having low overall trophies. They don‚Äôt know how to counter other brawlers well, or sometimes just the basic strategies of the game mode (i.e. passing in brawl ball, playing more defensively when you‚Äôre winning in bounty). 
---
The game assumes that because you have a high trophy count with one brawler, you‚Äôre at the same level as those who have the same trophy count but with 28 brawlers. This is obviously not true, but that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre stuck with. Just wish they didn‚Äôt mess up the trophy system by making it significantly easier for anyone to climb.
---
I feel sorry for you
---
LOL i need that 3 brawlers too
---
That for hide "made with mematik
---
Did you die!
---
nope
---
N
---
O
---
Tnx bro!
---
This is a good star power, situational perhaps but that isn‚Äôt necessary a bad thing
---
He can now slap the /B   A   S SI/
---
You are noob and want legendery me is on 14200 with 24 brawlers and you with 25 at 13800 and this is unfair and you want legendary (I dont have Tara Leon crow and spike)
---
Ohh really!Share a photo of your account

You guys know what's coming...

Shame that Darryl doesn‚Äôt get enough love on this subreddit

I write you the first time. I recently lerned that beta testers are to be given Leon's giftüòØ

No one cares if your a beta tester or not lol

wheres the animation supercell?

Piper is so fucking annoying. Literally just lost a match because some bitch pulled a Hail Mary and hit me from outside my screen. She couldn‚Äôt even see me in her in screen and a lucky shot later I‚Äôm fucked.
---
Hai, onii-chan
---
I like everything about this, but might I recommend alternating stone and wood blocks for the range test to make it easier to count how many tiles and attack covers?
---
Also if you thinking on a new name for her MIDNIGHT PIPER
---
That is AWESOME, You should keep making Brawl Stars Fan Arts. I honestly look forward to seeing what you can make if you continue.
---
Mudamudamudamudamuda

It should be a skin, cause I prefer the new one
---
what.. if I have no friends... HUH?!
---
LOVE IT
---
XDDDDD
---
Thank you
---
Excuse me, WTF
---
Genuinely thought this was Gedi kor
---
This is the best Bibi super I've ever seen
---
I mean, the skin was not available for almost a year. So, it is fair to say that it was limited time.
---
You are probs playing him in solo showdown without screeching solo.. he is very strong. When ever I‚Äôm matched with poco in random queue we always win lol.
---
They should add a report button
---
Tick though...
---
Who also misses Thousands Lake? :C
---
üò≥
---
Y‚Äôall just underestimate him. He‚Äôs balanced.
---
"He is not very good in Brawl ball"
---
Excuse me, but what the FRICK
---
He is SOO good on Brawl Ball! He can heal them with his super and real dmg (if he has 2nd star power) or he can deal a bit of area dmg and get his super very very quickly (and heal his teammates if he has 1st star power). Only reason he is not quite S tier, is his defensive capabilities are just trash as well as his burst potentially to stop these high health Brawlers from simply walking in to a goal. So he is quite strong in Brawl Ball.
---
Piper*
---
That would make him get leon
---
I always read sup erc ell
---
*Carl has entered the chat*

This is awesome lol you made my day
---
I think it should be simple, everytime a crow kill someone, it releases a cloud that do 250-300 damage per second for 3 seconds.
---
500, is too much it's 1500 for a star power.
---
What?
---
"first kill" *Shelly has entered the chat*

Till high trophies. At high trophies there's a TON of Mortises so he is really map &amp; match-make dependent B tier in Brawl Ball.

It was not the worst, I enjoyed this map more than most of the other ones, playing Mortis on this map is so much fun, especially because of the teaming throwers, (once again, when you play as Mortis, I really hate teaming) as it can be kind of a challenge that requires a lot of skill.

As I see from your post history you are not an old player either, so please, try not to shit post because mostly kids will start reposting these "funny things" and the subreddit will be full of shitposts. Like it is right now. Post quality posts, art, really good memes, good replays, ideas. Not just a screenshot that you consider funny.
---
Don‚Äôt play Mortis
---
frick no, 8-Bit's slow speed makes him balanced, he can't dodge piper's shots and he gets hard countered by throwers
---
God fucking damn it lmao
---
I also feel like there should be an option to have random loading screens if your idea was added. Or the loading screen that you get is the loading screen that corresponds to the brawler you are using.
---
I am not saying they are wrong, I am just defending my post.
---
XP probably will get something to make it significant maybe XP road by chronopierce

Ticks head is very glitchy

I used to pronounce it sup, erc, ell

Very true but I refuse to support this statement

thank you donghoon very cool
---
Penny can also do that, by herself, without even taking damage

How is that any more balanced?
---
Stop bringing up situations where people ain't guarding their shit, because only ass people will allow him to do that. Not to mention its only once so if he dies sooner it's over.
---
oh i learnt something new today
---
It is exclusive still
---
Its a lunar new year skin
---
Its back for 2 days before it comes back next year. Why u ask? Good question, Its a korean themed skin and Moon Festival Ï∂îÏÑù is mostly celebrated in korea (originated in china)

All limited skins are coming back each years

Alright do what you have to do.

Thanks for the downvote. Appreciate it

You have to give the Brawl Stars Team some credit cause didn't we just have an update 2 weeks ago?
---
I'd like to agree but i cant, I've been playing it for hours today and all i saw were shelly, crow, leon, colt and mortis
---
Search old man hitting a child on google lmao
---
No jk idk
---
Like 69 ?
---
No, it‚Äôs a joke about shotgunners clapping Mortis
---
Oh.

The only skin that will never ever be coming back is star shelly every other skin will

No pidas likes porque nadie te va a entender. Publica en ingl√©s. Y a nadie le importa que a ti no te guste Brawl Ball. Si no puedes jugar Bounty, pues prueba Gem Grab, o no juegues. No van a estar cambiando constantemente la rotaci√≥n de eventos.
---
Do you consider pre-nerf bandaid shelly balanced? If not, then you have no reason to believe "extra life" is. If yes, get help.
---
#Very nice
---
still the same
---
The problem is extra life is no where near as broken a band aid pre nerf. 
---
Now dumbass, get educated.
---
I hope to fucking god it‚Äôs a primo remodel!
---
Lmao thats just voodoo and its shitty ads that u see. Literally 95% of those ads like mom vs dad and shit are all voodoo
---
If you have a bush near by hide in the bush. If the bush is near a wall of boxes try to hide in a way that he can‚Äôt see you right away when he gets in the bush, so you know where he is, but he doesn‚Äôt know exactly where you are.
---
If you are not near a bush, to be honest they isn‚Äôt much. Brawlers like gene and crow are good when Leon goes invisible because of their spread attack. So if you using a brawler like these two, when leon goes invisible try to use your shots to cover ground of where he could be, by be wise with ammo management. It is kind the same for the other brawlers as well, but sometimes there isn‚Äôt much you can do against it, it is just too op
---
as a Leon main, I understand your confusion and anger. the best thing to do is just run and don't fight him close range. do not let him charge his super bc ur basically dead. he can one shot most ppl at close range. if u stay far away he can't do much damage at all and his reload time is super high! Shelly and bull and Rosa (with her ultimate charged) counters him.
---
Oh
---
Figure
---
Wow I am impressed
---
depends on the game mode but overall the worst brawler right now is mortis lol he does zero damage
---
its the landscape brawl talk
---
I got none of these except for the 13 min rr because el primo exploit so that means im a fake OG or OB
---
LOL
---
its funny how theres a poco named frank
---
Only true brawl star players will get this
---
Thats not why its just a low effort post. Im at 14k but i wouldn't post about it because other people arent going to care. Theres not going to be a discussion about this, so theres really no point other than to flex on people with less than 10k
---
Basically its only purchasable during the lunar new year (February) and only then that's why its limited
---
Not liking clothes from a country in video games is racism? Ok

You shouldn't have camped then

shouldnt there be a bot for the range test for like turrets

Ah yes

Using the decaying corpse of Jessie for an advantage
---
Best tactic
---
PHYCO PERSON!!!!
---
how would he think hes cool by talking about porn. Ur probably a 30 year old prude
---
I'm not talking about showdown but 3v3. Sure, he's OP in sd as well but from a competitive standpoint you have to look at 3v3 gamemodes because sd is way too luck based and random. 8 bit can just sit back all game and deal insane dmg from piper range and should he ever get taken down he'll just respawn and continue his dps rampage. This has made him OP in open brawl ball, gem grab and siege maps (keep in mind only throwers can really counter him well) in my opinion. All the pros agree he needs at least a slight nerf whether it be his second star power or his overall dmg output.
---
Now I gotta ask since you want me to "gid gud", how many trophies do you have?
---
Supp
---
Erk
---
Ell
---
Ty for the honesty most would burn me at a stake
---
In 13K gang -.- o.o
---
Sorry but i had to r/BrawlStarsp
---
Love him or hate him he spitting straight facts
---
Hard work to make one brawler OP and make him/her most hated Brswler before next Brawler will get OP
---
MAYA
---
After getting full stars, the player should get more points for kills
---
i won a bunch of games as shelly on this map
---
The rework is better in my opinion Daryl more consistent for me
---
When Leon is getting the recognition for being a shark
---
And then you can tell me if it's good or not
---
beta testers dont get free shit
