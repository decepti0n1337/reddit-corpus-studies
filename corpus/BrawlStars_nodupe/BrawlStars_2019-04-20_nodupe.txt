How fun would it be if a bull, or Daryl would go from island to island because of their dash
---
Life leech should be back in a different form

Leave modifiers as it is (spawning things)
---
Maybe like a new solo gamemode that swaps in 4th slot with tweaked life leech (u DON'T lose hp constantly but u never heal and only way to do so is by hitting ppl)
---
Progression is not the only goal in BS for some players. Being outstanding with skins make them enjoy the game more which I can understand :)

Noot good

Everyone knows this. Luckily, its not show as often as the old bunny penny bug, so your fine for now

They all had trash aim but good job ;)

Best way to teach teamers to stop spin is to spin with them then backstab

What mode is that?

no.

Hey, so, this may not help you and honestly it's a little crazy to me, but I think my issue was my phone case.
---
I've tested it a few times with the case on and off, and it seems pretty reliable.
---
Weird I can't get the issue to happen in the "Try" cave, which makes it a little more punishing to keep testing this.
---
I can't figure out how it could possibly make a difference, but I'm thinking maybe the little lip on the controller case that hangs slightly over the screen makes my thumb lift up slightly when I move to the left.
---
I have no idea but it's kind of disappointing since gaming on the bare phone cramps my hand up :(
---
Yes ik

Crow should be top, he‚Äôs not turning his back on the team, he‚Äôs turning his back on the user cause really you should win with crow.

It really doesn't, just curious because it's almost impossible to get that high without buying stuff

 you can easily super chain with shelly from point blank range, leading to way more damage than rico

Crow at 500 while playing mostly duos. Currently its at 516 at level 8
---
People might think Darryl needs voicelines but my professional opinion says that it would be much cooler for em to not have voicelines like Leon and Tara.
---
Oof i scroll through hot and new to get that DANK content
---
Jokes on you I open all my boxes anyway
---
Buff Leon!

4300
---
Progress will eventually be completed. Gems just speed the process up. IMO I think ftp players spending on speeding up isn‚Äôt worth it because they won‚Äôt speed it up enough to be meaningful.  
---
Like say you buy 1000 token doublers twice for 29 gems a piece 58 gems for 20 boxes, or what 6 days of boxes. Or you could have a 59 gem skin.
---
Also the reason they are not in hot is since alot don't get seen by others
---
My friend bushcamps with almost every brawler and teams in Showdown, and has very little duo wins. He is only at 8k.
---
Do a editar, no new bo hace diferent losing animation
---
What about throwers? They can shoot through walls
---
To bunny penny losing is gifting trophies to the other team.
---
Yo omg üòç this skin is sooo COOL üòé I would pay ü§ë lots üí∞ of gems for it!!!!
---
Then forget about it. It's not like being f2p give you disadvantage.
---
Its fun and games until the opponent plays mortis and you play Dynamike, Piper, Barley or Crow
---
when that's happen, I close the game and open it again.. and the fastest I can, I turn the "do not disturb". That's Bad, but I don't want to play with someone that the last time he played, was the vertical Brawl Stars vertion.
---
this is perfect
---
The fact that this is getting downvoted is making me lost hope from this community.

He commit toaster-fork guys omg

yes

I hate the robot..

Nothing or very little? That's a question I can answer. But I guess everyone has their own answer for that.

My wifi works fine. At my parents workplace, the wifi speed can be as low as 4.5 mbps for download and 0.5 mbps for upload, but it still works fine.

You‚Äôre always gonna at bots in random. Always.

When you're 100% going to win, spam retreat.
---
Amazing! Looks very fun and balanced. :) There might not be enough walls protecting the goals, though. Most Brawl Ball maps have a lot of walls in front of the goals, to make it harder to get an easy score.

No, Dynamike will just have a heart attack when he sees a shovel
---
Nope. Used the meme format from the credited user but I just made this. I did take it down because I had Rico and ricochete saying the wrong things if that‚Äôs what your referring to.
---
Playing with friends in the testing area sounds like a nice idea. SC should allow all skins and all brawlers in friendly battles, plus Playground.
---
Tara is better off with no voice, and wow! Your view on Spike. Truly creepy and horrifying in a real life situation.
---
is tnt...
---
This drives me nuts because I'll be trying to ambush someone and pass by someone else hiding in a bush then everyone knows where I'm at, 4 tiles is is a pretty large detection area I wish they either shrunk it down or made a detection ring visible so you knew how close you can get

1 - i did not know that
---
2 - no 
---
3 - they are in the fact that you use them to walk up and then go invisible and brawlers go slower on walls and when on the wall there is a button to jump off of the wall
---
4 - true but read 3

5 - u get off of the wall

---
Ya!!
---
Using Rico‚Äôs super and bouncing it off the wall is faster
---
I'm sorry but first flair means nothing, second it's obvious that at high trophies people just play him better like with any brawlers.
---
True, but to an extent. It does not matter that twice the amount of people are buying my product if I had to cut the cost of the product by 75%. Because of such a high demand, supercell could sell the skin at a higher price, while lowering the price would result in more people buying it, there would likely be less overall profit. They also don‚Äôt make any profit if you got all the gems for free, which makes a higher gem price ideal.
---
I'm just gonna buy her honestly
---
Bounty should be booty. Good job tho. These lines are much better than before.
---
Dr. Phill:"Your an alcoholic."
---
she is not so strong, you just need keeping distance from her, and more skills of aim. pls don't nerf her, she had been the worst brawler!
---
- infinity.
---
He just needs a deep menacing robot voice
---
Interesting... How did he do that?
---
Nita user here, well thats a good offer. IDK if they could make it for a bundle tho.
---
I like yours actually, but you gotta admit his a a lil bit smoother, crisper. But I like yours!
---
We don't know. He hacked it I guess

These are two different types of problems. One has too many hosted connections and the other is more server load and sync issues

Is this League of Legends?

Very strong cookie run energy being emited by yhis image

dude, you apparently don't understand the true potential of rosa's super
---
with it, she can literally win a 1v1 against EVERY brawler
---
Bcuz this was posted 6 hrs ars the release of bunny Penny
---
Quick question : what's your ideal strategy to get trophies?
---
I am done with solo showdown. I stick with brawl ball instead or Siege for trophies pushing. I hate gem grab and heist. bounty well sometimes but not frequent.
---
Do you know how can I do that on iPhone? dont have another device to create a new one
---
Give it a week you'll get back where you started, all for those star tokens.
---
Tbh the Pocos need it more than Dynamike lol
---
What LOL I never regconize there is some text under the accept/reject button for like 1 year LMAO
---
Will people be mad if supercell only sell it for real money? I know I won't but not sure about majority

um i checked your profile and you didn‚Äôt even post anything

At first I saw Ricochet's lines and then I was like, "How does 'vase' (I pronounce it 'vas') rhyme with 'face'?" Then a minute later it suddenly dawned upon me that there was another pronunciation for 'vase' and then I was like "I'm so dumb".
---
Because the spread is random.
---
What has changed?
---
Stopping the spin by spinning? 
---
Here it seems that you yourself tried to spin and team and when no one wanted to team up with you, you tried to became a hero. Nice play btw
---
Sketch app

Thank you

yes all the trick shots like shooting it at the wall shooting straight forward and shooting it at the wall but it bounces going to need a whole new icon to practice doing all 3 of those things. and I got the wrong think timer nice

Good job guys we finally did it except... it was supposed to be a sentence each reply... whatever noice job
---
That‚Äôs quite odd
---
They need to expand it
---
Oh i get it thanks!
---
yes, this looks very cool but id rather not want to play in this map. it isnt that playable imo. imagine playing with teaming tanks at the middle that could literally obliterate anyone that goes to the mid. also, spawning at the top left and bottom right corner's pretty dangerous cuz the other two opponents could push you back to the corner. this is more of like a combination between cavern churn and island invasion. maybe brawlifiers could fix it? i dunno
---
They're not suppose to attack. He just pulled them one by one using gene's super
---
I think the map is slightly to big for a 1v1, for 2v2 this would be an awesome map thought
---
Bo‚Äôs mines are highlighted and there are clearly no mines placed in the first clip after they explode when the super is deployed
---
I think that this is a very good solution because the main objective of showdown is still the same which is what supercell wants. Also, it‚Äôs not that different from when supercell decided to hide player names in solo showdown games above 300 trophies.
---
Notice how not a single brawler was animated with their right hand up.
---
Still cool though.
---
Great idea and combined with modifiers at all the sd maps can greatly reduce teaming. Upvoted
---
Ha actually dose have them. Hes using the flintstones method for driving
---
Oh that, it's because in the training camp you can easily spam your super and break the game.
---
thanks man
---
Oh got it lol
---
Awsome dude!
---
New GEDI-KOR
---
very shocking op
---
I got Spike yesterday the exact same way and my friend had the exact same reaction tbh üòÇ
---
I bought it 5 seconds after release
---
How often does teaming happen ? I haven‚Äôt experienced this since I started playing. I have been seeing a lot more videos posted though of this happening. So weird.
---
what?
---
Win 5 siege matches would be a hard task to do if you can only play with randoms.At least 500 trophies lost.
---
the trophy difference isnt that much different imo, pretty normal to me
---
k noob
---
__better than a brawl box or coins over 6k trophies__
---
I believe Ik you stranger
---
for what
---
this will break the game litrally
---
I can agree that the trophy difference is fine. but the power levels make this soo unbalanced. power 1s shouldnt lose to power 6s at 100 trophies
---
im looking forward to it, might follow you for a bit
---
Underrated comment
---
I also don't have gene
---
13viewes1K likes utube is drunk againü§£
---
The game was rigged tho
---
lol i tilted my jessie once by like 200 trophies but also got piper to 500 with randoms
---
Duolingo owl wants you translate that into English
---
And?
---
It was in the old version where the field was vertical. The bots would spawn at the top and chase the mortis, after 20 robots or something they would stop spawning. Too bad we can‚Äôt do it anymore.
---
if this happens to me, I am gonna just uninstall the game. I hate teaming in solo showdown.
---
I got today 14 coins and twice 4 power points for brawler I don't use
---
I'll take it but:
---
- Spawns a normal robot. If detects some teamers, turns red/gold and targets to them, going faster
---
- If it doesn't detect any teamers, then go back to normal form, stopping just 1-2 seconds and then act normal. If it detects more teamers, then transforms again.
---
I don‚Äôt have any Legends or Carl and am at 12k...
---
pretty sure her range is bigger than El primo's too....
---
I have a friend that has leon and spike while he got spike and frank back to back and im here with like 1.5k more trophies than him and i dont even have a mythic. When he told me, i had a similar reaction
---
Imagine if they coukd use this it would be amazing
---
And back to the point, the rules of teaming are if you join the team late, or after about 5 people are in the spin cluster then they will shoot you. One guy starts shooting you and then the whole squad joins in. Explains why on the last day of Cavern Churn there were no shotgunners...
---
A trophy reward brawler for 10k trophies?! That means almost nobody will have him!
---
i think you posted this in the wrong subreddit OP r/2edgy4me

150 is a bit too much

If they are gonna do it, there realistically hasn‚Äôt been enough time since it released to expect that.

The skin also looks bomb in game, which is really all that matters.

Most Shellys I fight don't use there super properly and use it when I'm far away from them

Yea, that's y i just can't play BS as much as i can, the game itself doesn't allow, unless if u wanna loose trophies

I‚Äôd use it

Yes very good food for morti like me uwu

Its diffrent things thats darryls star power and 80 reduction is the super for the other brawler

O no

What use is playing more if it doesn't make them anyoney.

Huh--

**NOOOO**

Is a crazy xd
---
This is better than coins...
---
They think that you're the noob when they are the ones that need legendaries to prove their status as pro. Also, most of your brawlers are maxed, surely that means you've played for quite a while, haven't you?

That's not the real leon

Yep, its bad but good job anyway

I also know someone who doesn't

I had this bug. You have to jump 2 or 3 times in a row. You have to jump down like forward to your spawn)

That would be good!
---
I swear if that is leon
---
S√≠! Yes!
---
Once my random colt teammate super all the wall instead of robot boss lol so annoying

playing more =  more likely to buy more gems and offers

There are some things like poison gas and gems that are unnecessary but overall it‚Äôs a good idea

woooow im unlucky...

They also need to ADD it to custom games

When I check r/brawlstarsp there are no posts in it

To be honest, I'd say the same thing

when u play with randoms and dont see them being stiupid

Yea gems for trophies is great. But also supercell can add to trophie road skins!

That may have been that that group of people had been waiting forever for opponents so the algorithm (which I think prioritizes speed over fair matchmaking) gave them the closest match

Alright thanks for the advice! I‚Äôve been playing since the Canadian only version but have no legendaries and only Mortis for mythics, still have 7.5k trophies though

In one attack, Rosa throws 3 punches. In each of those punches there‚Äôs is a spread of 3 fists. If any of the fists hit the brawler they will take the damage. If the brawler is in between 2 of the fists they will not take damage.

Why just not 500 trophys with a brawler and not 400
---
I would make a bridge to cross in the center of the map so in end game you can fight the other player
---
Everything
---
Boottoobig
---
Or bad randoms
---
I want gems in trophy road
---
I use 40 token got 12 boxes and guess what o got. 
---
NOTHING :)
---
Thank you!
---
Poor carl
---
Ikr
---
Is it just me, or is everyone seeing Morti almost every game in this map u/mortisgang
---
I can prove it but I feel that its kind of pointless to go to such lengths just to convince one internet stranger that I'm making OC lol. You are free to downvote if you dont believe me
---
I am a COMPUTER

You know im a beta player

Same Bugs Penny &gt; Doge Nita
---
Incase you couldn‚Äôt tell, both of them were dropping on purpose
---
I had no idea whre to put them...
---
I don‚Äôt think supercell wants too make it too inclusive because they want you to buy them bois so they can get the check
---
Batman

Where's number 10

Using super to bush check

Welcome to the rice fields muddafukka

Carl should be  first
---
He has 3k he aint good
---
Almost 50. Still plan to get her with gems though.

‚ÄúWith over 2500 submissions and countless hours of looking at your maps we have narrowed it down to these ones!  Thank you all so much for your participation in this contest!  Keep suybmitting your maps over at the r/Brawlmaps as the Devs are keeping a close eye on them!‚Äù

&gt; Keep suybmitting (submitting) your maps over and the r/Brawlmaps as the devs are keeping a close eye on them

they look at them there for maps not here, see?
---
O hell naw
---
It's a line she says on death or taking damage i think
---
already downvoted. a big salute to you for allowing me. if ever this gets to hot, ill sure come back
---
Also, please don‚Äôt judge how ranked down I am with Pam. Siege has me fucked up.
---
not bad lol
---
I dont really want colts tiny head in my mouth, but u do u
---
In Russia it will be 4 days after!
---
I think that randoms are too bad and I am too good
---
I legit have a legendary chance of .1082 and still haven‚Äôt gotten shit I have all the cards I‚Äôm currently 6,000 plus cups and I‚Äôm a level 90 . üôÉ
---
Dang thats a lot of screws
---
good one op
---
Carl is my name geology is my game!
---
Who wants totally different rewards on the trophy road?
---
*woah* there
---
Not really. Ever since his Star Power was nerfed, his Star Power dropped down to bottom tier. A 4x4 tiles vision increment isn‚Äôt really helpful, especially since maps like Cavern Churn and Island Invasion have been removed.
---
Reminds me of shroom boom from Skylanders lol
---
Dang that is crazy
---
But what does it mean?
---
weird and empty
---
360 no scope
---
Mlg Piper

Dont make me get Ben Shapiro on your ass.

U don't have to put colt's head in your mouth, it's a toothbrush cover, it's the 3rd time I say it, the toothbrushes for children are like that ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
The 2 extra tiles is way better than you think how many trophies you got
---
I got him up to around 115 ish, but I wanted to wait till he was at least level 3 or 4 because I‚Äôm bad
---
awesome, pretty sure the community should know more about this, would you pls post more?

Dude if a normal player has a levelled up mythical they shouldn't be getting a starter pack, that's pretty common sense
---
Sure
---
the less people there are the less people would know youre a teamer
---
Yeah it's completely obvious from the picture. Guess that means you are one of those people then.
---
This was literally around 12 o‚Äôclock at my home in America üòÇ
---
thanks
---
what
---
Because you are noob
---
At first i thought battle cats was line rangers ripoff lol
---
Line rangers is awesome
---
Fellow brawlcel?
---
i love this post so much, is it possible to give more upvotes
---
If ask what you mean but it's probably an invisibility joke
---
There are good bands out there. Got lucky to be in one but left so I could start my own following their example. It worked and now we're top 100 in Canada!  If you have above 3500 trophies and are interested join Havoc.

(Template by him)
---
Which notch?
---
He is the penis.
---
When they start to respawn, a growing bubble appears giving you about 1'3 sec to back up
---
For the phone
---
do you like the concept
---
had us in the first half not gonna lie
---
omg i saw this in robo rumble today and thought about the F meme! so weird
---
I lag every two matches
---
I was not talking about that but you are right

Only 21? That hurts my eyes.

Hello there dead.
---
k√∂sz√∂n√∂m!
---
(nem tudok magyarul besz√©lni)
---
^ lol you should be able to solo the first 3 minutes by yourself let alone if your teammates were actually playing
---
I hope that is right ^
---
Uh, yeah, you are right, my bad
---
The older one is the opposite of polished though. It‚Äôs literally so clunky.
---
Thanks.. Good luck to you too..üôÇ
---
Reality:
---
Opponents are Pros and your team is average
---
i feel bad bc at 4k i got Leon and players who've grinded the past 2 years dont have Spike or Crow
---
I got today 6.19 with jessie, bull and pam
---
Token doubler and max tickets on robo rumble. You‚Äôre welcome
---
Sure bud
---
all this merch potential,,,,
---
I think Supercell confirmed that Rosa is not related.
---
I love this stop the spin guys who spin on the record lol
---
NiceüòÑüëç it only lacks Jack Sparrow üòÇ
---
Double lol
---
Cavern churn was fun though
---
No.
---
Why my gem grab doesnt have power cubes
---
Very nice üëå 
---
Plz do Spike boi
---
I bet your eyes are thinner than your penis
---
yw
---
The logo kinda looks like jojo too
---
And all the characters with the one sort of hidden in darkness is similar to stardust crusaders
---
i like the concept but this is hella inaccurate
---
I bet *your* eyes are thinner than your penis
---
Sure be nice to get them green gems on the road to success and battle
---
Lmao all the greedy players downvoting you, I agree, supercell is kind enough to put gems in boxes yet people still want more
---
It's a concept not a final product and it's not hard to implement a map w/ those elements us featuring an off and I'm switch. Realistically it's going to be different too, don't take it at face value
---
Shitpost
---
Mcscuse me?!?!??
---
Living in the past I see?
---
i almost drunk bleach after seeing this
---
Show me some of that tentacle hentai
---
Those tight pants givin me furry vibes that I do not appreciate 
---
Still, what a chad!
---
What‚Äôs the reason for that
---
Bitch if you don‚Äôt give credit then you will die alone
---
Rip spike 
---
Ryan: rosa has surrived by punching plant in the face 
---
F for spike
---
When the people start imitating Nita:
---
Nita: _Are you mocking me?_
---
Rip
---
Try playing with tanky brawlers then
---
I had A Nita and a Primo got to 5 min and 15 seconds üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª
---
You know Nita and Penny are traps
---
brawl stars for DS be like
---
Sonic:THATS NO GOOD
---
It was a joke
---
Skarebjorn ? Hmm your name says something to me have we already met in a game? My IGN is Dr. Fox
---
This is not a tank map, not at all.
---
Always lewded Nita, except this picture. Too far
---
Lol
---
r/brawlmaps
---
Wow that movement just hit you hard at the worst time...
---
I don‚Äôt know what it says
---
It‚Äôs because today is 420
---
Left
---
Yes that a good idea
---
I climbed with Bo and Rico to 450 on Churn, not a bad map for them at all.
---
It‚Äôs beacause today is 420
---
**pam begs to differ OwO**
---
Of course,  You can use it bro.
---
I-am-creature-off-the-knight
---
Come on,
---
Poco has to have a massive BONE-r
---
I agree, the spike is too op I think they should reduce their damage
---
Lets say that I unlock Mortis. Im at 10k. Then, I would get matched against other players that are at 10k with maxed brawlers and im playing a level 1 Mortis that I have no idea how to play with. It would be so hard to gain trophies with any new brawler, which makes pushing a low level brawler a pain even at 10 trophies.
---
This is the main flaw with this idea
---
Watch Alaaddin
---
lol they have their human counterparts have more health
---
Nice creativity
---
And top players are who make them disappear. Every time a player over 500 loses 1 trophy disappears. If it is over 600, 2 trophies disappear, 700, 3 and over 800, 4. Those play more than 10 new players can do.
---
That he loved teaming and told everyone to downvote him to oblivion for all he cared
---
Flair checks out
---
Why so? Im interested to listen.
---
WHAT? CAVERN CHURN REMOVED. real?
---
Instead of continuing to make petitions we should just all agree on one lmao
---
You posted twice by accident fyi
---
Opps
---
Bazzart also works well
---
Mortis is good, you just run away from the whole match and in the end you kill yourself, winning 6 trophies
---
Bazaart*
---
Great thing man If this gets added I love to play the training Cave.
---
Tbh, would watch
---
You double posted
---
Thanks!
---
How can a skeleton have an average penis (poco)
---
Sure xd , sry for late reply
---
It looks like it says "STARS" and has a picture of Gene.
---
I opened 15 boxes got nothing
---
oh
---
New to forum, can tell what whoosh is?
---
Wtf mortis is top tier
---
New star power makes everyone in a specific radius screen ‚Äúgo crazy‚Äù hallucinate. (Didn‚Äôt really know how to describe it)
---
Thank you man!ü§©
---
Woosh
---
Loaded Rico is the exact same as el Rey
---
:((
---
they rent
---
 r/badcropping
---
Barley is a good colt replacement because of his super and how much aoe he has. Also really good at melting the boys before they peak the walls, you don't have to wait for a clear line of sight like colt.
---
Honestly
---
Yes, I admit to having exaggerated a littleü§£
---
And how you get it again...? and when u have 9 or less you bacically can do nothing
---
Noob pipers be like*
---
you are right
---
FBI OPEN UP
---
#oH nO, tHeY'rE hOt
---
Was my idea
---
no thank you
---
but with the photoshop one I got 60 downvotes bro and I don't know what happen later
---
Only the fire control. I was still able to walk around
---
Dont worry bro , most people dont get that differnet people come with the same idea . I thought about this too ( only 1 brawler tho 3 brawler thing confuses me ) still , He we can spread the word like that , upvote for ya
---
What is Brawl TV? Kappa
---
Best clip ever
---
Never gonna happen
---
I‚Äôm a creature of the night!
---
Nice :)

Bruh it literally shows that, from left to right (1st-5th), and in solo from upper left to bottom right (1st-10th)
---
Nice bro! :)
---
Shut
---
Shut up tiblard.
---
The only thing no one cares about the business and free stuff is better than buying
---
It really is. Royale requires much more skill than Brawl Stars. Auto-aim is a retarded feature that makes me want to quit the game. I just wish there weren‚Äôt so many no-skill brawlers as well.
---
If he didnt autoaimed he would have won....... but the majority can only spam that one button
---
You thought I was going to give you that power cube but it was me, dio all along
---
Spike
---
Solo showdown
---
So damn satisfying.
---
Yup.
---
Awww
---
Just go to the water then go get Leon :P
---
Cucumber Spike
---
You won‚Äôt
---
Don't worry about it haha, I meant flex btw. You know, like it's a phrase now ;)
---
Username checks out
---
Franks always spin
---
üòî
---
Ur a joke
---
Anything is possible
---
What is happening XD
---
i‚Äôd rather have them do leon‚Äôs super
---
I noticed that!
---
This was made for a fan art contest before Gene, Carl and Leon
---
Best way for me to lose all my coins
---
Spike has the potential to deal more dmg than Shelly close range, plus his super is one of the best in games. Bull has a better chance going against a Shelly than a spike in any given case.
---
I like this even though is old. can you update it pls.
---
ABGHUAGHUAGHUA
---
It hurts me inside every time I see it used wrong
---
NW Mortis is honestly just a flex on Free to players
---
*She's sugar and spice*
---
This looks like a filter
---
100th upvoter!
---
shhh nobody needs to know that
---
RIP tara spike and darryl (and le√≥n but that One need a buff or no more nerfs before a voice line)
---
F
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
I opened 23 boxes and a box just this day and got nothing
---
Lol its in order you bot
---
[s] true loll having a brawer with 676 trophies, it's just someone with 676 total trophies
---
You are invading my Reddit XD. Thanks dude.
---
Just buy
---
True. But some people are good at it, and it provides another alternative to get coins.
---
I hope she is a 30 gem skin
---
I just find your posts funny
---
Lol thanks man üëçüëç
---
What's the peak performance here. Shelly is the worst brawler in game rn. Crow is above average. You had a 4 poweup advantage. 
---
Not saying you bad played, you just did what mostly anyone could. It's like flexing beating mike w a mortis
---
Mortis should be beautiful IMO I find it awesome
---
I understand,. What are some exploits you have in mind? I have some. Maybe some cheating with high trophy bands, but at the same time, most of them have maxed accounts.
---
Lol thanks!
---
When you know you pay attention to detail to much
---
This is wrong unless they recently changed it. I got Leon on my mini that doesn‚Äôt have all brawlers. The offers are mostly random. New offers like new brawlers or skins are normally controlled by supercell on the day of release.
---
I'm not the artist but I'll make a request
---
He needs a super buff but a damage nerf
---
Ah
---
*ching chong*
