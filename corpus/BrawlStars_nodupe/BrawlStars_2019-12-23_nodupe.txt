It was mostly a joke but it could be from hitting the boss.

Actually yeah, I've never gotten anything expecting it. They just appear when you don't even ask for it
---
So people can keep the chain going
---
wait for brawler only offer.
---
Oh ok I understand now. Perhaps if they slid the buttons apart a bit, or moved them more to the left. Ultimately the point I was trying to make is I think it‚Äôs pretty silly that you can touch way to the left of the super button and it will still active the normal attack anyway. I think the super should have at least a little bit of a buffer around it.

Ok thanks

robomike. if you are asking from this image then rednose nita.

I like it

Part of the strategy of takedown is avoiding the morons who only target players...*cough* Jessie *cough* Basically, try to stay away from Jessie, piper, Penny, Nita, crow, or Leon. Most people who play colt, rico, Emz, tanks will target the bot and only target you if you get low or the bot has a shield and you‚Äôre a threat/easy kill
---
What the hell are these
---
Why couldn‚Äôt you just put ‚ÄúI was killing people in takedown‚Äù
---
Ngl I feel like more people would beat up the own goal person rather than the takedown player killer.
---
We will never revamp the trophy road

He telling you why he‚Äôs drawing colt. It has nothing to do with bea or max. He just like to draw the characters and show others how to do it.  What they Have in common is that they‚Äôre all brawstar characters.
---
I have a feeling the rocking will be back but if they make it permanent, they need to figure out a way to do it without the motion. It is fun and does add a different layer of strategy...but after about 3 games I feel like I‚Äôm gonna vomit.

Well she doesn't really do that much from long distance so if you aim I suggest you don't aim in the middle if the enemy is far, but a bit to the left/right so that two cards can hit the enemy instead of one

But then how am I gonna get a perfect 10/10 score?

OH HOW I LOVE BEAF BEAF BEAF

And with 10+ Power cubes

It actually means that ricochet at that time itself was a newer model.
---
You just proofed my point idiot
---
Yes. I wrote beaf so you could infer the ‚Äòbea‚Äô aspect of it so it could occur to you that it is a cross over between bea and beef
---
I guess that makes sense. Especially because I don't have any brawler maxed yet and therefore need the powerpoints and the coins.

what modifier?

Im excited for ricochet makes his comeback tommorow!!

They respawn, remember and come back for you. I do that sometimes, I know it's a dumb move but people are dumb sometimes, me too. I can win back the trophies in the next battle anyway.
---
In general though I keep on focusing on the boss but I try to remember which brawler shoot at me and if I have any window to retaliate, I will do. It feels great to see a brawler with 12 power cubes getting destroyed by me and the others. It's fair play.

Isa
---
&gt;"Isa is a snow angel, bringing joy to her friends. Her chilling icicles slow down enemies, building up to a freezing Super of an avalanche!"
---
Rarity: Mythic
---
Class: Sharpshooter
---
Main Attack: Icicle Strike
---
&gt;Isa fires an icicle so cold, it slows and chills enemies for a while.
---
Super: Avalanche!
---
&gt;Isa strikes a snowball with extreme force, resulting in an avalanche heading towards the side of the map! Her avalanche deals varied damage depending on its size, and it passes through walls (which reduces its damage).
---
Star Power: Snowed In
---
&gt;Any enemy Brawler that is hit by Isa's Super loses one ammo and is slowed for a few seconds.
---
Star Power: Endless Tundra
---
&gt;Isa's Super gets a 15% damage buff and no longer receives reduced damage after passing through a wall.
---
Bliz
---
&gt;"Bliz loves being cool - to the point where she dishes frosty love to her enemies! Her Super is a snowstorm capable of destroying everything in its path."
---
Rarity: Super Rare
---
Class: Support
---
Main Attack: Aurora Aura
---
&gt;Bliz chills the area around her, slowing and damaging enemies who walk in that area. The effect lingers for a short while after Bliz has left.
---
Super: Blizzard
---
&gt;Bliz conjures up a snowstorm that deals high damage per second and destroys blocks.
---
Star Power: Aurora Borealis
---
&gt;Bliz does increasing damage the further north she goes.
---
Star Power: Aurora Australis
---
&gt;Bliz does increasing damage the further south she goes.
---
Ruf
---
&gt;"Ruf comes from the cold Arctic, with his superb hunting skills to strike down any enemy. As his Super surprise he unleashes just under a dozen dogs at his foes."
---
Rarity: Legendary
---
Class: Fighter
---
Main Attack: Hunting Spear
---
&gt;Ruf throws his spear at his enemies, dealing damage. If his spear hits a target or a wall, it drops to the ground instantly. He can either manually retrieve his spear, or make a new one after a while.
---
Super: Sledding Herd
---
&gt;Ruf unleashes 11 dogs with a stronger bark than their bite!
---
Star Power: Narwhal's Horn
---
&gt;Ruf's dogs do an additional amount of damage per strike.
---
Star Power: Alaskan Army
---
&gt;Ruf's dogs gain an additional amount of health.
---
Chill Trio Extras
---
Fanon Relationships
---
Isa is good friends with Emz and educates her on winter wear, and she helped test Bea's drones' durability.
---
Bliz is Penny's twin who pursued another way of life. She contributed to the creation of Barley.

Bruh stop thinking someone's flair is the brawler they play in that map.. I play darryl in that map but still lose to long range with energy drinks

That‚Äôs a solid 10/10

Both of the brawl ball modes are on the same map
---
And Carl's voiceline, "So much ignorance, yet so little time."
---
He still has one of the lowest winrates there. The issue is that you're leaving your team 2v3 for the entire match as he can't do a thing against good tank players. It *may* change if Max becomes meta, as he counters her pretty good, but I doubt it.
---
r\unexpectedtf2
---
I have Spike too and he is the best legendary and second or first best brawler in the game.

Bruh newbie moment
---
No I know that‚Äôs Piper, but who is she talking about and the ‚Äúopen your eye‚Äù
---
please no .-.
---
But they serve different funtions
---
Oh that i saw that this morning this is not so special
---
From what I've seen a lot of people don't like it either.
---
Damn that is cool
---
Rico x piper all the way
---
it‚Äôs not bad but it feels like i might be the only one that likes her current one .-. it scream crazy and i love it.
---
Yeah. We have seen many posts like these. It is getting old. People are so ungrateful and would complain about anything these days.
---
Back in the days where Leon‚Äôs invisibility lasted 10 seconds, now it is 6 seconds. Many people didn‚Äôt want to play him again because he is now ‚Äúuseless‚Äù and ‚Äúunplayable‚Äù.
---
‚ÄúOld Rico is better‚Äù There is a lot of debate between Old Rico and current Rico.
---
Piper is better, but bcz people use her way over any other brawler, she doesn‚Äôt have a good win rate
---
Not a problem then! I have 16000
---
Oky now i will make sure to credit them
---
Ricochet:‚Äù You took everything from me.‚Äù
---
Rico:‚Äù I don‚Äôt even know who you are.‚Äù
---
Ricochet:‚Äù You will.‚Äù
---
U got it
---
I would love that, doubt they‚Äôd do it tho
---
Nice one
---
It's a friend game, relax, I just give my opinion.
---
Yeah
---
I don‚Äôt have a legendary at 13küò£
---
Look at that mortis, handsome boooooy
---
Getting max in the last box! Wow that is so real!
---
i would choose the random mythic
---
Its funny for me  because my only mythic left is max
---
I play bluestacks too
---
Thank you!
---
They said it was limited but then I was able to Royal Agent later as a promo for some reason. So like Clash Royale it looks like they will cycle back at some point.
---
She is talking to ricoshet it literally says in the comic
---
And if you refer to the scientific girl idk ask the OP
---
Wait, WHAT?!
---
yeah, but it‚Äôs in the brawlxmas thing I was just pointing out.
---
*BoOMeR*
---
Take out the cacti in the middle, but otherwise that looks awesome!
---
Boring ass game
---
The f*cking robot the nerde to removed.
---
Probably a new brawler for everyone
---
2 minites vs 8h. did you faild math üòÇüòÇüòÇ??
---
its the most competitive game on google play store
---
I think it will not (or may happen) happen in the shop..... As there is a chance for someone to accidentally click on it because of the sudden pop up..... So they added for the home screen......
---
Praise the best brawler, lord Darryl
---
Wow! Nice job
---
But if you didn‚Äôt saw it no problem
---
But what is their connection?
---
I am the controler of the beeeeeeee
---
Laughts in addicted to reddit*
---
If ye need plot, the robots could be trying to destroy the cacti, and eventually ally with the humans after seeing piper and ricochet. 
---
The people could be disgruntled after Rosa and Bea ran off to help the cactus horde, and Morris running off with max to go watch race cars.
---
Tysm! I'll be making a remake of this illustration because resolution is really small. Thanks for criticism, though, I also thought that chin should be smaller because he doesn't smile fully

This is good please continue this!!!!

Exactly.
---
Yes, I and wrote, that this fingers legs, can be Internet the interpreter something not so translated, pardon for this. Lol, I know this is a game, but the number of toes on one foot should be equal to the number of toes on one hand and the same with the second hand and the second leg, because Poco is made in the likeness of a human skeleton. Sorry, if there is something wrong in this text, here I used an Internet translator. I hope you understand this text correctly.
---
Bushcampers be like
---
Bo's phone should be an eagle
---
I absolutely love Don't Starve
---
It‚Äôs Rico before his remodel, who used to be called ricochet
---
She's riding her dragon.
---
Thats supercells balance team they tink leon so op that leon can kill a power 10 mortis üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

If Dyna gets his old one Brock better getting his 5th skin

or El Primo. She looks like primo ffs lol

r/thebrawlstarscactus

I think it new update
---
Omg Duude yesterday I got bea and sandy from small boxes all the five months of getting nothing was worth the wait
---
He is not leon is
---
But depending on what skin if it‚Äôs a gem skin then sure.  For PowerPoint skin they should make powerpoints in the boxes since 1powerpoint= 2coins.
---
I'm very confused 
---
is piper also the sientist
---
am dumb sorii
---
we found it in the game files but frank said to celebrate the anniversary they well give us special gift so its might be this
---
It happened more than once xd
---
Is this a jojo reference?
---
I why it happened  bounce at the direction where the Wall got destroyed  so the game make the go some part around but there is no wall so it did all the way around to the Place where Jessie can get to normal
---
I'm like you, I played for a year and unlocked my first legendary 2 weeks ago, Leon. And imo he is trash without starpower. Even with starpower he is not amazing in any mode besides Showdown maybe. But showdown is filled with Shellys which is bad.
---
You will notice when you reach 650-700 trophies with him.
---
True Story[Leon](http://www.googl)
---
But mortiiisss
---
Yep
---
It's because they're streaming it, if they'd just send you the replay file there would be no issue. Even in replays and bot only games you can drop frames if the connection is bad.
---
Hugs in pain

Glitched

Isn't bibi bull's sister?
---
Why in this map I make Shelly at Rank 20! :(
---
Great work
---
I always thought Bull was like 40 and Bibi 20 :o
---
If I understand you correctly, some-who are calling ‚Äútoes‚Äù like ‚Äúfingers legs‚Äù. If you mean something other, please, write do you mean.
---
Cuz je send this on discord and i am not stealing memes without Credits (he is my clanleader so yeah)
---
Next Update: Leon got removed again due to technical difficulties and error in his coding
---
Ur grammar bad
---
Lol 1k players be like all brawlers all skins
---
*try me bitch*
---
Did you faild english
---
I laughed because of Spike's face
---
Delet dis
---
Yes let's make every map the same without bushes to ambush enemies
---
Darryl's ship showdown?Are you kidding me?
---
Kira.I sense a jojo refrence coming.
---
But if skins are in brawl boxes your chances of getting an actual brawler go way down, and it‚Äôs usually pretty low already.
---
We might be in different time zones, so please clarify.. Is it the very next shop update? i.e in just under 16hrs?
---
[crow](http://crow)
---
Good freaking grief
---
No i acctualy got leon at 3055 and didint get anyting but darril at 2k so i was stuck with only darril till i got 2 one next to a nother carl and penny at 8k (because of that 3 is my luckiest nuber then 8)and lastly that dammed forbitten rico at 12k out of the mega

I know it was just a joke xD
---
In this person's defense that actually is OG ricochet and not Rico because ricochet has a hat and skinny body while Rico doesn't.
---
You doing this for upvotes?
---
GOTTA GO FAAAAST
---
His concept sound a bit more fun though
---
Why tf do these posts get so many upvotes and an award
---
Ricochet wasn't gone, he just went to the gym for some months
---
oh ok
---
CPT.Carl best waifu
---
They had some of it in beta but they removed it because they were not quite happy with it.
---
The only interesting fact I recall was Bulls last name (Blanco) and El Primos Lore of being hit by a Meteorite giving him super powers
---
Edit: I really hope its coming back, forgot this to say, duh
---
Wtf why
---
nice man, but my argument atill stands that yours is actually so dumb for comparing people who can barely ever get a basic necessity of life to people who wont spend money on a game.
---
God please make more comics.

I reposted it ;)

Bull is German-ish and Bibi is obviously Asian (Japanese to be specific)

Makes it look like you did it on purpose

Yes yes yes Oh my god!!!
---
It‚Äôs completely fine to have a lot of Leon memes in the sub - the devs said they do take these into account, and how long did it take them to buff Crow when they didn‚Äôt want to? But they still did eventually.
---
What doesn‚Äôt make sense is that this got an award - it‚Äôs not high-effort by any means.
---
Yes, it affects his teammates too
---
Shelly needs a meganerf for her super. It is ridiculous. You see Shelly‚Äôs bullying around everyone in levels by players with low self esteem. They shoot through walls and kill over 10 power cube El Primos like that.
---
Gene should buffed.
---
Makes sense
---
Then teamers will do classic "hitting the wall"

I agree. Shelly's Super is too strong and charges up way too quickly

---
Shelly is fine but her ability to stack super on hit it broken.. She can literally take out the entire team with multiple supers it's ridiculous.. It's hard enough to try to keep your distance with her range

---
I got Mortis in that Mega Box, hope you'll get a brawler in it
---
Its 100.
---
Still. It means cocoa.
---
Because you called russian people dumb dummy
---
Check their story and some leaks and I'll probably put it together what we getting
---
omg
---
yeah it seemed more likely to me as well
---
The other mortis skin???
---
Still dude, it's a star power for a reason
---
GOOD ol Richochet
---
Ask for a skin refundmas its no booster for experience its not unfair to the other players and by so support MUST refund you the skin and youll be able to get colt
---
Only 30 gem skin with a different projectile
---
At least she isn't supering everyone in the vicinity
---
excuse me what the fuck
---
Most of the time smoke trails is better
---
r/nooneasked

You don‚Äôt have to ask. It‚Äôs in the public domain when it‚Äôs posted on reddit.

I'm confused. Is Jessie Piper's daughter or something?

There's a good chance this is unique! I checked 87,601,628 image posts and didn't find a close match

Take a fallow
---
Ok then
---
Once but I didn't know because it was one of those matches where the names don't pop up. So I didn't know until a couple days later I was on the bottom half of a coach Cory video.
---
Yes, I just discovered that yesterday
---
Yeah..........tadpoles........
---
3rd Joker : ppl who didnt like the remodel
---
Wow,congrats :)
---
Plus it was my first mythic
---
*Tactal Bugs, incoming*!
---
imo the game really needs some **clear** lore cuz there clearly is some, and its for sure not small bits of story, weve been hinted by official devteam member's posts, brawltalks (and its respective teasers) or even some in game content, but nothing is clear and its wayyyy too ambiguous
---
 A friend and I on a 3v3 mode we played with chief pat
---
Someone refused once i tried
---
I love your art!
---
True. But I don‚Äôt buy skins and hate having them shoved in my face
---
Pirate Poco is amazing.
---
Nice Rico won
---
Same.
---
Are you serious?
---
You haven't seen teaming till there's a Rico, two Morti, a Bibi and a Bull teaming up to kill a four-thrower team. Every match at 800 is a 5v4.
---
I bought her in an offer
---
Haters gonna hate

wow thats crazy but i dont remember asking
---
A bit sad that it got spoiled to me, but I'm super happy he's coming back to the game! Looking badass as ever!
---
Marco NITA
---
shut up Shelly user
---
im too drunk in pepsi I CAN HEAR COLORS
---
He's actually good at higher trophies. Because of Bo's vision all bushcampers have no purpose, and he can inflict more damage and respond better when the whole enemy team is found. When people only use brawlers like Emz and Brock you can just run in and squash them. Because that high up Shelly doesn't exist in Snake Prairie anymore.
---
I wish I could give a platinum award but I'm too damn poor
---
OMG
---
So cute!
---
Max
---
she really is a dragon huhh
---
Seriously. I don‚Äôt always like the tactics p2w games use but supercell has made 3‚Äôawesome games, 2 of which i still play. They are daily entertainment and I‚Äôm happy to support the devs
---
Mind. Blown. Someone tag gedikor &amp; mail this to him. Life is a trip.
---
By averagjng 271 trophies/brawler :/
---
Today, I've met him a lot of times in BrawlBall. Unlucky, he was in enemy team, while I was trying to push my Spike xd
---
Again, if you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt play it. If you can‚Äôt figure this one map out, skip it. Missing one star token is not the end of the world, and you missing a star token once per season is not reason to remove a map most players enjoy.
---
Bibi's super can attack multiple times. I first but it 2500,but that's too much. So I put it 200
---
Y think sonic would win
---
That's so annoying
---
He was broken last time he dashed that far. That‚Äôs a bigger buff than you seem to realize.
---
Also, this would *completely* break Coiled Snake. Do you want Mortis coming at you from 7.5 tiles away?
---
r/cursedbrawlstars
---
Omg why I got 17 upvotes O_o
---
yeah, I have cory on my friend list
---
Yea, if max's star power didn't exist...
---
R.I.P. RICO
---
stfu
---
How about like 800 or something
---
700 trophies is nothing. If you can‚Äôt get past it, you need to improve your skill level.
---
Maybe some will play him
---
Never trust a bull
---
Hello Romanian brother, I also got paired with Chief Pat in April, too bad I don't like him...
---
I would watch this
---
Me too
---
Wow 30th brawler must be nice, still grinding trophy road
---
Hello, well,that sucks
---
Mortis is immortal!
---
Bruh what happened to this sub
---
People with Loaded Rico or popcorn Rico wont give up on them
---
Why?
---
Its lone star
---
I think is so fun to play on this map
---
Young pam skin confirmed nani. Young pam could be skinny for a skin ")
---
On my old account I got both Penny and Darryl in the same normal box...
---
This implies you have 2 legendaries atleast
---
No 500 is enough
---
Just got sandy today while i was reading this lmao
---
This was my most wanted star power when I started the game. I was putting all my gold into Bo as soon as I got him, couldn't get him to level 9 though. Nowadays he's one of the brawlers I neglect and haven't leveled to lvl 9 yet :((
