Yes

I spend way too much time on this
---
It kills me but Nintendo is the only console company I‚Äôm supporting for the near future. 
---

---
After COD BO2 and then coming back around for Destiny/2 I‚Äôm done supporting companies that put their stock prices first. With the DLC Monster it‚Äôs hard not to throw Nintendo in that category but at least they‚Äôre trying to innovate in a positive way and their games have always been A1.. 
---
Just my thoughts at least! Would be hype af if BrawlStars followed FortNite and got on the Switch! 
---
Ypu better bushlieve it
---
Via the first permanent offer; you could only get 795 coins for 106 gems instead of the 800 offered. Not sure how that‚Äôs a negative misrepresentation 
---
Ok but there is something in the map called big game and I created that
---
As the notification makes your game lag and the bull kills you
---
They can do that with all the controllers
---
where is the luck percentage located?
---
Mummy pig
---
It‚Äôs likely that they are bots
---
2200 Trophies. Only Penny, Mortis, Spike, Leon left to go!
---
Its a bad joke
---
Modern problems require modern sokutions ;)

It only seems to you, most Russians hate you, Americans. A survey was conducted around 2014, it turned out that 85% of Russians hate Americans. I do not know how now. Yes, and in Russia is not very good with the quality of houses. In general, not very nice with us.

damn nvm then... guess I won‚Äôt be welcomed but then again that was 4 yrs ago

And those shellys were brocken
---
Lol I pick *character worse than bull and primo * in bounty
---
Stop crying please
---
Yeah. People say it was the worst supercell game in existence and it's absolute trash but the game was still in BETA! It was way far from release so ofc it wasn't that good in terms of matchmaking, progression, etc. 
---
Pros: New brawler Leon is very creative and definitely changed the meta.
---
(This one is good and bad) Darryl Rework changed his role from a heavy tank to a bulky assassin type, making him a new possible ball carrier in brawl ball.
---
The 3D artwork to the background is amazing.
---
The new addition of a new ticketed event: Boss Fight (Even though the game mode was exploited, it‚Äôs still a challenge to players)
---
New skins for Shelly and barley are amazing, barleys was a shocker.
---
Cons: The new UI is cool, but it lacked a feature: club searching (while in a club).
---
The lag has increased slightly, but overall gameplay is good.
---
(This is more opinionated) Poco‚Äôs voice needs a rework.
---
(This one is good and bad) Darryl Rework changed his role from a heavy tank to a bulky assassin type, now he has a very high skill cap making him difficult for new players to play, and he is underused in a lot of game modes (This is my opinion, from all of the matches I‚Äôve seen).
---
Balance changes weren‚Äôt very effective: Pam was strong already and got a health buff, crow still needs a slight buff, spike and Leon need some nerfing, and mortis needs a small buff as he is a high skill cap brawler.
---
I'm argentinian, it's fine in the image
---
That‚Äôs not high trophies.. you don‚Äôt know anything about teaming yet lol
---
Cool
---
U probably have all th power points to max ur others characters
---
Some people want to save the brawler points for legendary/mythic brawlers they don‚Äôt have yet, but want the boxes to have a chance to unlock new brawlers, as well as the gold to upgrade existing brawlers.
---
I am just guessing based on his post.  I am not the greater of the post lmao.
---
Nice just saw your toxic Shelly super me 3xs as Pam ;‚Äô)
---
You just flexin on us
---
I hated the Elixir so much it was annoying just getting 1 of 2 elixir back to back
---
Teaming is a strategy, also your solution is dumb af, we lack emotes so the only way to taunt other players is spinning, ive seen way too many people crying about this ‚Äúissue‚Äù. Just deal with it, or betray people trying to team up with you if you may, whatever. Improvise, adapt, overcome.
---
Do you know how to contact them? Go game to settings, help and support, then press the small message icon on top right corner. I guess your new to supercell huh?
---
This is a repost
---
Doesn‚Äôt xD
---
I‚Äôm not salty and I could care less if it came to console or not. I play mostly PC. I have Mario and smash bros for the switch.  If it‚Äôs a shitty boring game, then why are you in the sub for it? You‚Äôre actually an angry ape lol 
---
This just shows how badly the auto-aim function is. Right now, a bull/shelly near you is basically GG, back then, with good walk patterns you can dodge shotgun shots.
---
Bush. They do 0 damage and dies to 1 Shelly super.

[Leon](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3347831) 
---
Yeah Ik, he gets more coins and I‚Äôm supposed to get more 
---
27 -&gt; 72? 
---
or I'm mistaken
---
You dirty P2W... Lol i have also put money on the game, but just for skins. Did you bought all of the level deals?
---
Yes, i think they were level 15, 25 and 35 iirc
---
I would KILL for tap to aim
---
I saw his icon first and thought it was his nose
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
O Felipe
---
Bull takes way more skill to use at high trophies than Leon.
---
Yes, I cared that the sub is getting clogged with this kind of stuff, I don‚Äôt care that he pulled Leon though.
---
TerraBull!
---
What? Just what? Franks? Barleys? I wish my showdowns were as good as that lol. The only game mode i play is Showdown, and just like 3 or 4 people chose the same brawler in a match, the other are variety of different brawlers. And just if you are wondering, i have 6776 Trophies (Wish i could say i have 6666 lol)
---
So your saying Leon takes low skill? Cause sure as hell Auto aim don't always work cause hhis shots curve, and his invisibility was nerfed.
---
Bull takes "skill" hugging walls to get an opening and Juking. But then again everybrawler needs to juke.
---
Remember when Mortis was an Epic? Those days were pretty nice imo. (aka the original version of the game)
---
I have a question. Is it possible to have a friend spectate your game and tell you if someone is hiding in the bush?
---
Lol nice. How much did it cost?
---
Hey everyone in this thread I don‚Äôt know what I said, sorry if I caused any trouble I‚Äôm dumb lol
---
This actually sounds pretty fun, I feel like they would need to add some content to justify it though 
---
1. hYPe Is OvEr
---
2. cOnTrOlS aRe TrAsH
---
3. tWo YeArS In BeTa
---
We're not saying he is easy to to play we are saying he is low skill cap. Learning to juke and Dodge isn't hard and every brawlers has to learn to do it. And please don't use "peaking" as exclusive to bull 
---
Why do you need a larger screen? In the end console and mobile players will have the same amount of vision of the map, so i don't really see the point
---
Theoretically yes, there is a 5 delay for spectating so you technically could, would just be delayed.
---
Take a screenshot of your map, then tap "post" and tap "post image". 
---
New event in 2mins, you could get your big box at least 
---
That's if you have him...
---
Colts be getting the high ground. 
---
Thanks!!!
---
I might be a crow main if I had him...
---
Just played a match with 5 Leon's. All we're under level 8, all we're placed 1st-5th. Broken
---
Really? That makes me happy because i know that i'm gonna get a Brawl box AND a Big box the next match that i play lol
---
How does that have to do with anything..?
---
*fortunate son begins playing*

As long as your having fun. Your level is directly affected by your win % so those guys are obviously just grinding a little more than the rest! üòÑ
---
FACTS. For me it‚Äôs the token doublers but yeah same thing haha 
---
I imagine like in most supercell games, that there will eventually be some equivalent of either a clan war, chest or something of the sort.
---
That makes me better and feel confident. Thank youüòâ
---
you can‚Äôt see* 
---
Tenho uma id√©ia de skin para o Frank seria ele mas com a skin de lenhador,esperem que gostem da ideia e adicionem futuramente no jogo.obrigado
---
whenever someone attempts to team with me in Showdown, I play along for a time being, pretending to travel with them and even shooting at an enemy, before immediately killing them. I have no patience with it.
---
great comic by the way, it‚Äôs true and funny! üòä
---
Honestly I‚Äôd be down for this. It would add some excitement to showdown which can sometimes be kinda boring (if you‚Äôre playing very passively).
---
Save 500 gems and buy a leggendary on the shop
---
 It would he weird since some brawlers are made to ambush, and there are a lot of tactics and strategy involved in the bushes. 
---
A map with lava though...
---
That sounds tight 
---
Looks really good man!
---
Wow! great idea! I've thought about a brawler whose super creates walls, but wan'st sure about how positioning would work. This would be quite an addition to the game!

---
Its a plumbus
---
How it feels. They probably will do it soon, lol they just let everyone buy him for like 50$ just so they could make fat stacks before nerfing him and bringing someone better in
---
Nice no one cares. Post some proper content instead of ‚ÄúOMG PULLED LEGENDARY‚Äù
---
Then get 8th instead of 6th... I team and then fucking kill the teamers bc they are the scum of the game
---
It's just a loading icon.
---
Longer range, shots bounce granting more versatility,  shots are also easier to hit with the slight spread, shorter reload speed, arguably s better star power, and a better super
---
Mine doesnt reset? 
---
Yeah but it wouldn‚Äôt be good for supercell lol
---
True, you gotta give them props for that

How colt you say this?

Nope, it has been going on for weeks now.

lol me too. I've opened soo many brawl boxes, and the only brawler I received was Penny, whereas my friends who started during the global launch, literally pulled leon and crow, and pam,rico and spike.

We just need a new game mode that prevents people from camping all game

I never team XD, but i like to kill the people that spin trying to team with me, is a little bad, but....easy

This is super rare. Did he carry hard?
---
That does seem like it would‚Äôve been a better idea, lol. Anyways, thank you!
---
i hate the people who will spin and pretend to team, then instantly kill you, and I don't do that. But if you're spinning at me you're fair game as long as I don't spin.
---
That he got banned for nothing!

That is one of the reasons to kill them when they are spining...

:p

Lol, I‚Äôm an impatient man

Excuse me?

Sorry?

Could you please restate your statement?
---
He has a low floor so you can do well with him when you start, but when you get to actually mastering him (skill **cap**), he's one of the thoughest to really master. 
---
Jumping over walls seamlessly, double jumping, Jumping to evade shots while still getting closer, using your super &amp; throwing your attack at the same time so the enemies bounce into your attack, etc etc etc. There's so much shit to learn &amp; master.
---
Sorry can you repeat yourself?
---
50$ skin easy

You could‚Äôve so easily killed him, when he went invis you should‚Äôve shot him because he ran to you in an almost straight line

The trick is to strafe left when shooting, then the stars shoot in a straight line. Don't strafe and you get them scatter so few hit.

It takes pretty long for it to spawn,in SD as a darryl i can roll to it and kill other players tunning for it also you can save it for later and camp it creates much more cool things in bounty but it should be balamced that it spawn on both sides of map equally

Awesome, I'm just glad someone at supercell at least has read it, haha I put over an hour into it. So yeah definitely talk it over. I don't think it's really necessary at very low trophies, but I can't see how it could really negatively affect anyone besides the confusion of figuring it out, and I think it certainly would be appreciated by everyone at high trophies. Just seems like something pretty simple which could solve a lot of issues. Anyways, thanks for reading my post. And I really appreciate the response.

Your health slowly drains for the duration of the game, hitting an enemy gains back a certain amount of life, killing an enemy grants you full health

Where you're health is constantly draining but you heal up a little for doing damage and heal up completely for a kill

That's like saying, "I'm no good at engineering but here are my ideas and designs for a bridge"
---
I don't have a problem with his super, he just deals a ludicrous amount of damage. 
---
What are you talking about,
---
It is always there
---
So the idea here is to show which brawlers have their star power. The idea came to me while playing on the full bush map on bounty (don't remember the name) and each time facing a bo. It is REALLY hard to tell if he has it or not. And in that case it is game changing ! And even with the indicators on the brawlers. It is often too late to find out. 
---
Let me know what you think of this :)
---
Nah. Get them to trust you and kill them b4 they kill you
---
I'm almost 35 how much is it?
---
Happen for me too, he had 6 gems and jumped in all 3 and died instantly..... 
---
Only works when the phone is closed. However for iPhone users 
---
Token doubler is 50 gems. Gives the the equivalent of 10 brawl boxes. You get 10 brawl boxes in 2.5 days.
---
To me, that is totally worth it if the skin is 30 gems. It's like skipping one day of brawl boxes.
---
Just WoW üò∂
---
If the bull was on the left it would be bull shit
---
And I thought I was lucky by getting Tara at 1000 trophies lol
---
Maybe 1-30 games you'll find a good random but now after global every body mains brawlers so now it's impossible to find a good random
---
Cause darryl aint trash lmao why do people think he is bad

Wow. Nice English bro

Exactly that is the problem right now, ure forced to team or u will lose. Unless u backstab like 4 other people and get enough cubes to kill a team or two.

I see I see, yeah makes sense Pam is stronger in the current meta than crow. And yes Crow feels very weak currently. It is still no problem to push him to 500 tho.

So many lag with this mode

Yes, but his super still feels a little to weak, especially the healing. üëæ

Bad chance
---
Not a repost. Just coincidence.
---
Actually I think it would add a great element of variety. The enemy can already see you have a star power - that‚Äôs a lot of information. In gamemodes such as heist where teams are already predictable, having a Bull with some unique alternative star power could be very interesting and a change from the defensive based gameplay at high level.
---
Showdown is battle royale if you think about it
---
Yes. 
---
Read his comment.
---
Yeah, super annoying, lost 5 tropheys because of it
---
I have to turn off my WiFi and play on my wireless (cellular) connection in order to play brawlstars.  It‚Äôs so strange and annoying.  My WiFi connection works great for all other games...
---
That‚Äôs very good
---
TIL. Thank you for the info, never noticed it was there. 
---
That is entirely wrong. Each big/mega box counts as 10 small boxes. Just go read the info on them in the shop
---
i know, but that‚Äôs not how the mm system works.
---
under that logic, power also gives a huge advantage.
---
should mm put players in matches with similar trophies and power?
---
it‚Äôd just increase the time drastically.
---
Yes I know, that's why I mean by "the indicator on the brawler" but it was not very clear ^^
---
19.0 is really really high considering the normal percentage is around 0.12-0.11
---
No chance, Pam will hit him with screws
---
Supercell commented a few days ago saying they were aware of the issue. 
---
What ?
---
Not all heroes wear capes
---
Yeah best gamemode
---
so the shine gamemode from mario kart 8?
---
also this is usually known as KOTH (King of the hill), but involves holding an area rather than an item.
---
Is he dead ?lol
---
You as le primo
---
Teammate as le poco
---
Le poco has full power
---
You dive the enemy team trying to kill the gem carrier, since you expect poco to give you a bit more sustain
---
Poco has a power that grants movement speed in area
---
That's just an example, but eould you like situations like that? Probably most of the community don't 
---
All SC maps are symmetric 
---
This could not?
---
Maybe that‚Äôs a lesson for you to not main a single brawler. If you haven‚Äôt, then you are just unfortunate to have come across such players. Frustrates me too
---
Thank you for your complimentüòÑüòÑüòÑ
---
Nice. With the amount of boxes I have, I'll have a 10% chance
---
This is the best way to make campers disappear, nice job!
---
They probably wont do that because theres already showdown. But still, if they added this, the spawn would be a huge part of winning or losing 
---
Duh, 40 bucks
---
I mean, Brawl Stars is pretty damn balanced. Only 2 or 3 brawlers are OP, and there is 22 brawlers in the game. I think they make a good job at both things.
---
Bull, Bull, what have you done?
---
P.S. your grammar :|
---
Ugh i totally want to 3D print now!

No it can be comprehended pretty easily. It‚Äôs not been finished yet on Supercell‚Äôs side.

Yep, will be interesting to see how bull and other bush type brawlers will play.. hahaha

Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
My only maxed on this acc is frank others are level 5-6-7
---
As of right now, that is correct
---
So you wanna boost even more the star power, making it unfair for the people without it? Sounds cool.
---
Good job!
---
Me_irl
---
That‚Äôs pretty impressive! Hope I can do it too, thanks bro
---
It would make darryl completely useless
---
Same here, I'm more of an SD player and I love playing it.
---
Because there is a mode for teaming. It‚Äôs called duo showdown. Solo showdown is every brawler for themselves. If you can‚Äôt place well on your own, then you don‚Äôt deserve to place well at all. Just how I and apparently a good chunk of the population see it. I got my Jessie to 440 and stopped playing showdown because I couldn‚Äôt win anymore at power level 5 and refused to team. 
---
I don‚Äôt complaint about teaming to the degree of most of this sub because I don‚Äôt see any way to avoid it happening. It‚Äôs a very abstract action ingame and the only way to crack down would be a report system, but no one is going to report themselves so it is what it is. 
---
Id say bull and barley 
---
This offer will pop up again, don‚Äôt worry about it.
---
No... This is Patrick.
---
Make this to a series!
---
Hm when my brother made this post it got like 50 upvotes
---
They wouldn't charge the super a lot, just a bit. Also, all of these star powers are low tier.
---
Please remember that this is just an idea...
---
I‚Äôm not going to upvote this shit
---
So many people, so many bushes, so many Bulls, etc
---
the max gems you can hold in gem grab is 29.
---
They said they are waiting for a "Big Update" To add replays, so you'll have to wait
---
Is it hard to believe? More people can play it, maybe more friends tell her her to play and she re downloads the game now that it's global. Changes have been made. Honestly it's like talking to a conspiracy theorist. Sometimes the answer is pretty simple. It COULD be a beta player. Or just a regular new noobie player with friends whove unlocked events. Trophies that low with a couple of wins isn't hard to believe when she could very well just lose, or win. Lol. It's not like she's carrying 100+ wins under her belts with just the three brawlers. 
---
Why?
---
i need replay too so that i can diagnose my type of play.
---
Can relate. Lol!!!
---
There are 6v6‚Äôs now?
---
You aim and then click either the normal attack or super button
---
I'm probably gonna make one every day. :) 
---
where can i see the legendary probability?
---
Click on a box in the shop, then click on the blue ‚Äú!‚Äù And it will show you everything
---
Thnx
---
And star powers on the damage
---
Looooool
---
Moms credit card always seems to work for some odd reason..
---
Yep although the damage will not increase anymore when the bullet travels farther
---
*dildos
---
no
---
idk lol. i open them in the moment i get them. I don't believe that you have better chances to unluck a legendary if you stack them up, that's bullshit. Also, what's wrong with this legendaries? You don't like them? You really wanna wait for a new brawler?
---
This is main strength of darryl,he has weaker super but its selfrechagable,if other better supers would charge up without shooting darryl would be useless also game would be less dynamic...we already have like 4 camping bulls on each solo showdown
---
Showdown with more people and rewards???
---
ikr. And this guy is complaining just for 3 weeks lol
---
They should make it so the circle doesn‚Äôt always finish in the middle
---
Yeah but brawl stars did it first. (Brawl stars was released before fortnite) and I‚Äôm pretty sure the battle royale bandwagon started with fortnite. But there has been battle royale games ever since hunger games became popular
---
You mean 6 minutes and 15 secs?
---
Old
---
Skin = win
---
It‚Äôs fine if u play a character like Jesse, Penny, Pam that can solo carry a game. But when you play colt or ricochet it‚Äôs impossible to win if your teammates are bad. 
---
Yeah because skins&gt;skills
---
I would like this as an unranked gamemode where you get no rewards. Just a permanent mode that you can play for fun 
---
I just ran in circles with a guy until the storm killed him
---
Just hit 100 showdown wins today, I can't rely on team games unless I play with friends
---
Maybe, but probably because is there are 2 attackers no-oneis gonna open the boxes making no one able to escape.
---
Everything nearly $300 plus and the pants are $30. Made me laugh!
---
Uhh. I don't see the problem
---
I can tell you haven‚Äôt had a Leon with 15+ power cubes up your ass in a while 
---
TIL tapping the attack button is considered skill
---
I‚Äôve only ever spent gems on skins haha
---
Power level 96 Leon behind you 
---
He doesn‚Äôt need a nerf. He needs a buff the most out of all the characters. 
---
prostitution :3
---
Yes.. I presume it‚Äôs a server thing because I‚Äôve went in with my 2 roommates in gem grab/heist/bounty where all 3 of us got stuck at ‚Äú6/6 players‚Äù and froze only to come back to -5 trophies 
---
Rubber dongs if ive ever seen one
---
How? I don't have any friends on the app nor am I in a clan.
---
What now?
---
Play showdown---&gt; get a couple power points --&gt; get hits on people so you get your super --&gt; sneak behind a weaker brawler and kill them--&gt; profit
---
yeah ^^
---
Not in fps
---
Also, if someone spins, they want to be passed to
---
Bo lvl 10 heaven*
---
Lol
---
i don‚Äôt have an issue with that, i just thought matchmaking also depended on power level - my bad again
---
Sad fail :')
---
What did it say?
---
This idea is freakin‚Äô awesome!!! Well done!
---
Leon and anyone basically 
---
It runs PUBG tho
---
Can u show the attack and super as well
---
So?
---
It is, and unfortunately there is nothing the players can do unless SC finds a way to implement a working system (as if masking names do anything) to prevent this or enforce some rules.
---
Players like u/tsunderehaven do not care about playing fair so they just cheat and actually do feel proud about it.
---
She played more than 20 games and is still level 2. Prove that

Poco is really fun I use him alot in Brawl Ball his attack is really good at zoning and when I charge enough for my Power I can actually save my teamate with low hp since you always die first 10s of brawl ball. You should try using him there! 
---
Awesome! :)
---
For real though they nita stop
---
Nothing, keep doing your amazing posts
---
Cool. But u ever did this ,killed a primo and went back to kill the other team? With only 3 power ups? 
---
I have 8500 trophies and every brawler except leon, 4 maxed brawlers and 2 to level 9
---
Trust me : getting to 3000 trophies is the hardest part. The game becomes more fun when you reach 350 trophies per brawles so you have to use different strategy than hiding in a bush for the entire game
---
Yes. Me and my teammate had 8 powerups and got 3rd place in duo showdown. The team that got 2nd place was continuously dying the whole game and BARELY getting the respawned teammate to tank for the dying teammate each time. 
---
An easy fix would be to make shots go THROUGH the respawned teammate instead of the respawn teammate tanking everything. 
---
If you cant beat em join em!

No problem, but I do think the 10 ron is worth it if you see yourself being interested in playing the game for quite a while longer.

Thing is, typing &lt;c5&gt; Autumn &lt;/c&gt; ends up looking like this 5&gt; Autumn &lt;/c&gt;

The wall is neant as defence and not as attack if you talked about that.

I dunno I just pick up this while browsing thru

Ahhhhhaaaahhh

I don‚Äôt have it until now. And it‚Äôs quite often. I am using iPhone to play it
---
+1 trophy for each kill is broken. I like the idea of rewarding players for kills though
---
Who did not know that?
---
By the looks of it it is invalid format launching, but I really don't know too much on scw files.
---
Trainer Leon challenges you to a battle
---
Maybe +1 per 2 kills?
---
the system rolls 10 times so u have 10 times the chance of 0.1441 for legendary and 10x 1% star power chance

I have the same plus Bo, at 4600.

Yes, the damage reduction is too much.
---
...and longer than primo's...

I agree. Any kind of RNG in competitive games annoys me. I wish they‚Äôd change the RNG of which direction gems pop out of the center too
---
Tweet this to supercell then they will pay attention

But if this wad the case we should have more boxes

same
---
üòÇüòÇ quite true

ow i didnt know it was already posted. I am sorry i dont see every meme in this subreddit
---
When you open a box there is a certain percentage added to legendary percentagei guess it‚Äôs like every 25 box you get 0.024, the other rarities doesn‚Äôt get effected, when you open a mythic brawler your legendary percentage drop 
---
I‚Äôd say shorter than piper and longer than Darryl

Wtf that s too overpowered thats like 4 crows and a leon
---
I wouldn‚Äôt have trust issues if these randoms didn‚Äôt give me a reason. Gem carriers suddenly think they‚Äôre invincible when they get 10 gems. People use their supers when they‚Äôre not near the safe and when nobody‚Äôs around in heist. People think standing in the goal and not fighting in brawl ball magically stops the enemy team from scoring. And duo showdown my god, your partner runs off and ends up getting killed over and over and you end up being their spawn. 
---
SLIM THE SLIME
---
Attack: He throws a slime ball which after hitting the ground bounces and continues travelling until it hits the ground for the second time.
---
At the second hit the radius is half from the first hit but double the damage.
---
Super: Slim starts bouncing on the ground himself for three times dealing a small amount of damage but he knocks back the enemies. After each bounce he lands 2 tiles from where he activated his super and that is controlled by the movement joystick.He can bounce over the walls.
---
Attacking will cancel his bounce.
---
Star power: Sticky Impact
---
When Slim hits somebody with his bounce the enemy is slown down for 2 seconds.
---
What? Barley can beast it out with enough power cubes, or just hide his way to top 3 or 4
---
I agree üòÅüò´

Let‚Äôs cosplay

Do they colour over the lines in game?
---
But you literally only played like 1 game cuz you only have 6 trophies so how is it a ‚Äútypical‚Äù gem grab 
---
Yes lol
---
It shouldn't  matter as long as they stick to solo SD and stay away from 3vs3 modes. Why? Because  they use brawlers who aren't good for some maps and that's a disadvantage for their teammates at high trophy ranges.
---
I saw it- he doesn‚Äôt a girl, just a cute boy

I saw another user comment something along the lines of this on another post which was similar; Just because the brawler is legendary, doesn't make it op and above all other brawlers. Because if that were the case, then all you'd ever see would be legendaries in each and every match. What rarity the brawler is doesn't matter, it's how you play them that matters. 
---
If crow isn't working for you then maybe try changing up how you play with him or even take the time to look into how to properly play him, because complaining about you not being able to play him isn't going to change anything. Only reason Leon seems so op is because he was a new brawler designed to change the meta. And with new brawlers, it's takes time to learn what you can and can't do when it comes to attacking and defending against them. 
---
Side note, you can't really complain about crow being bad when other people can get him above 500 trophies while keeping him at level 1. 
---
Fair enough, bull is great for that :)
---
HE?!
---
Awesome
---
No prob! :)
---
Bruh mortis is awesome
---
Yea. I also like leon though. Both are so much fun to play 
---
&gt; Side note, you can't really complain about crow being bad when other people can get him above 500 trophies while keeping him at level 1.
---
That‚Äôs been done with every fucking character.

And? P2W helps to keep the lights on while you get enjoyment from a game for free
---
Ugh I fucking hate that map
---
Exactly. Just goes to show that rarity doesn't matter and how you play the character does. 
---
I tried to have a link on excel online but it didn't really work out
---
I'm close to getting him now only started this afternoon so hopefully won't take long but I'm enjoying el primo 
---
Imagine if they added that and his super was a puff of smoke like how a dragon shoots fire
---
Maybe if u had fucking trophies that wouldn‚Äôt happen
---
I' the 800th upvote.

I agree, piper is so fucking hot

where did you get that?

I love his single lens sunglasses!  This is perfection.

Until you hit a cactus and bounce back into the el primo you tries to escape from
---
TUWWET TYME
---
You are so nice! Too bad i'm poor and i can't give an award 
---
Well you are on Cavern Churn which is a great map for the brawlers you hate. Don‚Äôt play the brawler, play the map and game mode. 
---
I've seem you somewhere
---
Who‚Äôs Pief08?
---
That isn't your original artwork, that's just a low-rez image of El Primo. Anyone can do that. Big whoop.
---
It wouldn't be too bad if it's one or the other and the damage is somewhat low. I like the idea of a saboteur.
---
I prefer the damage reduction, personally. 
---
üëç
---
Bit lucky? Lol
---
How did you record this?
---
cooll
---
extra range too op like would piper deal more damage
---
git gud brah  
---
1) if you have a strong character makes sense for other players trying to take you down first.  
---
example: A and B vs "strong brawler".  
---
"strong brawler" beats either A and B 1v1.   
---
Only way for A or B to win the game is to take out "strong brawler" together, and then fight 1v1 without him.  
---
2)are you talking about gems or power cubes? if you are talking about gem grab, mate, a team goal is basically to take down the one with most gems   
---
3) of course if you are between two people they will "team" against you. You got in a bad place (probably even your fault) and you're an easy kill. Why should they let you live? If you die they get better placement.  
---
4) ??? is the name given by the game to every player when you are over 300 trophies.   
---
It's done to prevent teaming with people you know.  
---
PEW! PEW! PEW!
---
You‚Äôre in cavern churn which is a map that is great for short range high damage brawlers (bull, Shelly, primo). To be good at brawl stars you don‚Äôt play the brawler, you play the game mode AND map, then choose your brawler 
---
He is quite good if you play around his super. 
---
It lets you secure kills and escape death so I think poking enemies until you get your super is the best way to play him in showdown. 
---
Why a T shirt?
---
Should it have rolled sleeves?
---
Exactly. That‚Äôs what I am doing recently as well.

---
It happens to me too, i shot first, then he shots, but for some reason he starts shooting more faster than me (I'm also spamming auto fire). I believe it's because the device, but idk
---
I‚Äôve already fallen victim of that
---
"get gud" really? You act like idk how to play the game, when I certainly do and have enough fundamental knowledge to propose a solution (which you ignored). Sorry, not gems but power cubes.   This is only in regards to solo showdown.  Also some of those situations I understand, like 3 people are left.  But I'm talking beginning of the match, all 10 players are alive.  When I'm referring to teaming against a stronger brawler I was trying to convey situations like you are a leon with 0 power cubes, but 2 Shelly's (with 4 cubes each) chase you around ignoring everyone else.  Or when the match begins and see where everyone is spawning in and 3-4 people go straight for you, completely ignoring crates and other players.  I've seen people team together from start to finish of a match, that's also bs.  I'm not referring to the trapping yourself between the storm and other players.  I'm talking about  direct targeting from start to finish.   You saw the video of all those Mike's (like 5-6 of them) teaming in a video posted here, you don't think anything is wrong with that?  Also ??? Doesn't do shit to combat teaming.  
---
Personally, I speak with over 520 showdown victories, with only 8107 trophies. I only play showdown. I suggest practicing stuff like kiting, baiting, and dare I say, "team and betray". As dirty as it is I pick up quite a few wins by pretending to be a teamer, and backstabbing when the time is right. 
---
Have pati√´nce my friend and wait for new brawlers!

Don't mess with me

I like his Name. 
---
Wow that's amazing
---
I would not say stole at all, he has an image where is is a stand off, but with spike and bull instead, and it‚Äôs in gem grab. While this could have been inspired by his, it is in no way his idea at all.
---
Nice, could you send some links? I found the official BS discord tho but I don't know how to find more servers

I started doing the same when I was at 1000 trophies, in less than a week I'm hitting 4k

I checked, everything is on. It happened without me changing anything
---
I have posted this on Kairos' discord with lots of positive feedback, so here goes:
---
**Felix**
---
**Bio:** Felix is from the same tribe as Nita and was the runt if the litter. So, Felix harnesses the elements to conquer his opponents!
---
**Rarity:** Rare
---
**Speed:** 720 (average)
---
**Health:** 3400 (max 4760)
---
**Attack:** Burning Whack 
---
Felix uses his flaming wooden stick to burn others! (Felix hits his opponents with a burning stick that leaves them on fire (similar to Crow‚Äôs poison).)
---
Damage: 320 (max 448)
---
Burn Damage: 240/s (2 s) (max 336/s)
---
Reload: 1.0 s
---
Range: 2.5 tiles (75^(o) cone)
---
**Super:** Juggernaut Rage 
---
Felix builds himself a robotic suit with his fire sticks that shields attacks and makes him faster! And it‚Äôs made of all-natural ingredients! (Felix enters a suit that is made out of his sticks which makes him slightly faster, blocks 75% of attack damage and sets grass on fire (which can spread) when he walks on it. But, because the suit is made out of sticks that are on fire, it will only last for 5 seconds.) 
---
Speed: 770 (tank) 
---
Time: 5 s 
---
Burn Damage: 480/s (2 s) (max 672/s)
---
**Star Power:** Mineral Meditation 
---
Felix finally harnesses the power of the water element, and uses it by walking on water! (The star power allows Felix to walk on water puddles.)
---
Awesome! Thanks for the advice guys! 
---
I feel like pam is an old woman
