Leon’s range isn’t the part ppl don’t like about him. It’s bc he can deal such insane dmg up close. I wanna see like a 12% dmg nerf and a 0.5 second shot delay after invis

Cute Darryl bro!

Tf when did they change it to sharpshooter I thought it was rocketman

you can run but you can’t hide, bitch!

Spike is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen, even if it hasn’t words 😓

So larger devices in Brawlstars have larger screens, so they get screen borders in the larger maps like showdown so they don’t get an advantage. The screen borders used to be greyed out and show the map, but not brawlers and power up boxes. In an unannounced change, Supercell decided to make them solid black. This looks terrible and they are just slapped onto the screen. When they were grey you could still see the map and the looked high quality, now they just look cheap. I have seen absolutely nothing about this, and have posted multiple times. It’s frustrating as it’s an annoying issue, and every time I post it nobody cares.

I'm not sure you probability

If you are a teamer, then in your mind it should be another considered a tactic that could be used. If you can take the risks don't team.

Only one percentage changing doesn't make sense.. It will still have to add up to 100%

It doesnt matter those are just who i think are really good because i have everyone level 10 except leon so you should focus on those brawlers

This happens near and above 300 trophies on a certain brawler. It is used to prevent orgamized teaming

Please god no

No

is that another way of saying ur scared?

That is my entertainment watching bull killed by another bull

In my opinion it is a great idea as it does give the player a sense of exclusivity and is a fun way flexing on friends 😁😁. How About A Ninja Tara For Chinese new year

it better come with that lil boy too

Men, I think you're a bit lazy
---
Check in game😢
---
The best gift someone can have.
---
That made me laugh.
---
But in all honesty, when I started, I didn't get Shelly (and Bull) at all, because I could not get a single decent hit with their distance. That's why I only used Colt at the start. Only until I get pounced at by multiple Shelly hiding in bushes that I realized the potential of that close range attack of her shotgun.
---
It's not ALL luck, but mostly luck.
---
Haters will say no skills
---
Well I tried using Daryl and I think it's a very good brawler, it's not for sitting in the bush and camping however

yes 1v1 kthx

I don’t think the drone should follow him around it should follow other players and shoot from a distance, I like your drawing though.
---
Exactly

Rocketman is dead 😰
---
I’d say just luck at least for the spike guy but if the guy with Mortis and frank has like all the other brawlers before that too he may have spent some money but still could be luck
---
😭😭

This only happens in showdown correct?
---
(Insert eyes here)

Do you record every single box that you open or something

because nita is a strong brawler of course

also add effects to the skins (not phoenix skin)

Whoa, I never really thought of that, never tried to get better at the game, would never have come up with that on my own /s
---
Pushing trophies will definitely help you get more boxes... You get tokens for xp level which you gain regardless of winning or losing, you also getting tokens from ranking up brawlers which is directly linked to your trophy count. You also get bonus boxes on the trophy road. I'm only at around 2000 trophies but I've found that using brawlers on the right game modes can make a big difference to your win ratio, you may be really good with a certain brawler and can skip the first couple hundred trophies but after that if you use a brawler on the wrong map/game mode it's so much harder to gain trophies.

Mae darryl shoot twice in the same cone, he is too inconsistent.

ClusterBomb is Battery and HookDude is Ruin

It s better than original

Which three?

It doesn’t matter. All Shelly’s should be shot tbh
---
Frank primo and Shelly

That's clean
---
It’s the same with any match. Technically the AI did the job, not you. So you don’t gain any

blast on school announcements or you guys gon get Primo's dong and you'll see why they call him "The First" or "The Cousin" ;)))

Haha, maybe later :D

Nah, it doesn’t happen only with the Play Again button. It happens to me when I start on the menu. You should just reload and search again, saves a lot of time

99% of the time i get star player when we win a 3v3 match and it doesn't even feel good anymore

The thing is I normally wouldn't agree with this stuff. But the thing is that the legendaries can be so absurdly rare when compared to other games like clash royale. Some people probably have played since release and never got one. I think that this is honestly a good way for supercell to profit and for the BS community to actually enjoy a character that they would otherwise never get

Or choose the coolest one and just lie

Got Leon today at 2450 out of a brawl box. It was thirty minutes after school got out, and I'm glad it was because I screamed so loud.
---
Thanks bro, I made it when I was a complete nerd about the game. And trust me, "fidget spinners" definitely fits the Wild West theme. I mean, how else you gon' get the perfect trigger finger?
---
Tbh I think Supercell dropped the theme and didn't want to go overboard with it and I'm pretty glad they did. Just kinda sad they dropped OG music with it as well :'(((
---
I've never seen someone with such skill

Yeah me, because I saw that this was posted with humor tag and OP just killed somebody NAMED Leon.

Doesn’t even have to be a gold skin, maybe a gold trail on projectiles that you can turn on in the character selection screen.

Saved 33 gems?

12k here. Top players just go back and fourth to try to be unpredictable. Penny isn’t gonna be a good counter to piper if the player knows what they’re doing.

Yeah

I though they said "pipeline of new content" its been a month and all we got was 4 skins and leon being in the shop confirming its a market tatic to make him this op

Yes dude ..  just giving attention to the newbie players

I like the idea of being able to hold down choke points lets new sd meta form with brawlers like jessie and pam but sadly trowers are the clear choice usally

NANI???

Nice!  Enjoy being broken kappa.

Lol i wish i was still in highschool

I might have missed the point of the post. Was the goal to play as terribly as possible? Because that was atrocious. 
---
You can't say what I should do sucker.
---
I almost exclusively play Poco and always buy his points incthe shop. Ive not yet played with or against someone a higher power level than me. Unfortunately it doesn't make me any better at the game!

I supered gem carrier first but I died somehow so we lost that gem grab match

Tbh I wouldn't mind

Just 2 words:Git gud
---
Energy drink is waaaaaayyyy better than life leach
---
Yeah same, I couldn’t tell if he was just that bad or if he was putting on a play
---
Stop crying and play the game, holy this community is a bunch of little kids crying about a brawler being "too strong" well guess what hes a legendary so ofc hes going to be op in the beginning. If legendarys are equally as strong as normal brawlers then why would you wanna get them or even spend money on them...
---
Wait for the uncle

Oi.

Don't touch Jessie

Cute!

BAn tHIs FuCKINg GaME.

I don't think this will ever happen. Although making life leech more often than it is currently would be great.
---
God stop crying and play the game, im at almost 10k Trophies and i havent been "unfairly" killed by Leon in a way that would make me think "wow omg so op pls nerf im bad at the game :((((("
---
Totally agree with you where you said that pushing with your best brawlers almost becomes impossible after a point. Looking at the trophy system though, it really is most efficient to play all the brawlers to a certain degree. If your brawlers are level 5-7 you should aim for 300 trophies each, where your ‘mains’ could even push to 400-500. There are many people who pushed brawlers below lvl 10 to 500 and I didn’t believe this but I recently pushed Jessie lvl 7 to 501 with a great gem grab team. It is definitely possible with the correct brawler, gamemode and teammates!
---
I'll never forget this random Shelly on my team. The score was 1-0 and she was at the goal with the ball. The entire enemy team had just died and started re-spawning behind their goal. Instead of just scoring the ball and winning the match, she decides to taunt the opponents by obnoxiously spinning. Their El Primo used his super to leap over the goal took the ball from our 200 IQ Shelly. We lost the game 1-2.   
---
😬😬 I have 1.6k 
---
your reaction was pretty much mine when my friend got spike at 200+ total trophies... and even right now at 6k i don't have him.. or tara.. or crow.. or leon..

No problem! Join!

At first I wasn't going to list it but as I thought about it more it seems worth it.

No problem join!

I'm coming my guy! Thanks

Yes, there are sense on my comment, you just can't understand. You generalized as if the game was broken, maybe for you, not for everyone.
---
I know many people also have this problems, but just as i said, not everyone. 
---
Im sorry
---
"WhO WaNtS SoMe CaNdY?" 
---
The stat difference between brawlers 1 level apart is only 5% on health and damage. This means say that a lvl 7 Shelly vs a lvl 10 Shelly is only at a 10% stat disadvantage (stat power doesn’t increase stats). In short, the majority of your games should be down to skill, team comp and teamwork rather than say ridiculous max decks at 4k in CR. Also if you use auto-aim more than manual aim you will certainly be capped at 300.
---
Looks great! But Franks eyes got me 😂😂😂
---
Teaming is the most disgraceful thing to do in this game lmfao, but ofc there is some people that are just straight trash and cant play alone in a SOLO mode ;) Everyone caught teaming should get a cooldown from the game for some months.
---
...and by ruining the game makes you happy?
---
Am I meant to take a screenshot everytime i unlock a brawler just to prove it to you?
---
&gt;. Shelly's super. It just rekts everything like I was once a 13 powerpoint bull and my opponent was a 8 powerpoint shelly. I thought I would win, but she just run at me and bam I'm dead.
---
Shelly is a tank counter and you were a tank so it's logical that you lose
---
&gt;2. Supers loading. It's unfair that only Darryl has the perk that makes him charge his super overtime, so maybe you can add it to all brawlers so it would be more fair?
---
It isn't unfair, it's the thing that makes him unique and to compensate this his super is less powerful then other superd

Obviously they will. It wouldn't be Supercell if they didn't.

---
Crow is a great brawler. Been number 1 in the invasion showdown consistently. Just have to learn how to play with him. Plus once he gets the eventual buff that should be coming he may become the new leon.
---
So upgrade Colt then

That colt was a bit off from that bush
---
Funny, we get tons of Egyptian Tara’s on here and they’re all really cool. Nice drawing.

That's a cactuar

Result is Bull camping

We should call this match "Slight Disadvantage".

No

Darn he draws better than me

I like it! It's original, and pretty funny!
---
Cisono ita
---
Eh, fun idea but personally i think applying RNG in any kind of gameplay is a no go. I wouldn't like to bet my trophies on luck. There is no counterplay, no way to control where you actually teleport. Energy drinks require basic aiming to take advantage of, meteors are able to be dodged, robot spawn is alerted to nearby players. Maybe have the portal teleport you to predetermined locations, which are marked on the map info?
---
that date is for an event this weekend we set as a reminder in our chat. Its facebook messenger
---
Sometimes i miss it

(Seriously though what's supercell's problem with exit buttons??)

So if the duration of his invisibility is nerfed, won't it be proving you're wrong?

Haven't even unlocked him yet.

A shit meme is a shit meme

Probably cuz OP wants to buy it and thinks that other people would buy it too. Did you not draw this conclusion while reading the post??? It seemed really obvious to me, but maybe not to everyone.

Someone already made it

That has nothing to do with this change.

Who did he kill? Everyone

Me every time.

“Alright buddy, you have 10 gems, time to ba-no wait, where are you going? Get back here! Oh for, they’re dead and now the opposition is winning.”
---
I'd buy it but I actually want to be seen so...
---
I had Leon in my shop but it would've taken all my gems. As Free 2 Play I didn't take it, was that a bad idea?
---
Man you’re taking that bait, he’s just going to post a pic of himself with no jacket on because Leon’s invisible
---
Don't we all sometimes?
---
i have 7.8k trophies and 22/22
---
Well, I didn't know he was at the peak. 😶
---
There is good rng and bad rng tho - the power drink mode is a good example I'd say. But OP'd idea unfortunately is not.
---
I agree, predetermined locations could work, in strategic locations, and perhaps have cooldown periods of around 1 or 2 seconds.
---
I N V I N C I B L E

Hard to decide. He is op rn, but might get nerfed soon.

It's nerf or nothing

Well tbh you can’t expect people to want to play with you if you’re lagging, not to be rude or anything but I would’ve kicked you as well
---
Why did you post a black picture? 
---
Super cute! I think there are not enough submission with original content like this!   
---
Most of the entries are just really badly photoshopped screenshots. Try finishing it!
---
however darryl does not have any chip at long range
---
They said it was okay but now theres so many people complaining especially big youtubers and streamers so im sure they will find a solution. And for me the cowards are the ones teaming not the backstabbers... Ill backstab anyone that tries to team with me no problem and ill never feel bad for doing that since it is indeed a SOLO mode :)
---
And they shouldnt eliminate teaming by making a new Gamemode rather by fixing the issue in the first place.
---
Why is this sub so illitterate?
---
Yes hence one of the factors for the weaker success rate
---
Exactly! I want to support the idea

I would buy

Oh really

Who would've known
---
It's called super go back to overwatch
---
They shouldn’t be
---
I just like poco’s star power because it can be very good at times, it’s a nice tool to have
---
Backstabbing is deceitful, and makes you a liar and untrustworthy. I'd just not team rather than being a traitor.
---
Agree with you in second part.
---
this is an idea, safes around the edges
---
It doesn't mean just because i have a leon flair i want to wear a fucking lizard hoodie 
---
hahaa 8/10 could refer back to text more often
---
Not from point plank, he doesn’t.
---
3D is good-looking but i hate that update because it caused lag.You guys can fix the lag by adding a 2d /low grapihc option.So its a 1/10 update in my opinion but adding a 2d option would be soo much better otherwise i  will probably delete the game

That's just sad

There needs to be an element of "total player trophies" in the matchmaking formula.
---
Someone that is 500 total trophies is not the same skill level as someone that is 10K trophies. 
---
Something like, **under 2k total trophies plays together. Once you pass 2k, you get placed in the next player pool of 2k -4k and so on.**
---
The current system **does not work** and punishes higher level players. 
---
We have to be able to play in teams and not in teams and it should be somewhat fair. Right now if I play in an organized team, I win 90% of the time. If I play with randoms, I loose 90% of the time. It doesn't make sense. Obviously playing with a team should be a higher win rate but playing with randoms should be at least a 50% chance if you are a good player. But it is no where close to this.

Thats normal

Are you serious right now?
---
Get a magnifier if you need one
---
Why are all the comments downvoted?
---
Kewl
---
Look at his belt it looks like there is...men’s parts
---
This is why Bull hides in bushes
---
Ik sorry 😣
---
This is one of the first Tara skins I’ve seen on here where I would hands down buy it
---
But the maps arent made that way
---
I’d buy it because Leon is like my fav character and his hoodie is cool.Maybe make some plushies to
---
Damn, she thicc
---
Did this. Lose 6 trophies, it was showdown.
---
Yes, have you tried walking in one of them?
---
Ikr
---
Thanks!
---
same here. ive lost so many times bcoz i used normal attack instead of super :| 
---
With skill you can win :)
---
ikr? id cringe
---
Hello Jeorge, Gem Grab Hunter!
---
Eat shit and die
---
Just call her ”Mimer”
---
No it was because they had a maintenance break and everyone thought it was the Leon nerf
---
Exactly like this, when I got Leon and Crow recently, was just happy and not having a stroke like most people would do, or at least the YouTubers would
---
I agree. 
---
Granted I own Leon, but upon use he does seem strong. He is really strong at close range just like Shelly and bull. However he doesn’t have an ult that does damage and his attack speed and reload speed is not as fast. And since his hp is low, he isn’t a killing machine. He can def assassinate one character, but not multiple characters...not so much. 
---
Leon popping out of the bush and killing a weak unsuspecting brawler is no different from bull, shelly or even Darryl for that matter. Just my two cents...
---
Leon tip #1 delete the game
---
Leon tip#2 eat shit and die
---
Ever since this game launched globally the exit button rarely works.
---
Thanks for the help! 
---
I remember this from r/natureismetal
---
So many great ideas that my very simple idea will probably get lost, but here it is: I would like to have the **option** to make the Super joystick a **BUTTON** again. It would work more or less like the old days: press the button to "activate" the super, then use the regular attack joystick to fire (either by aiming or autofiring). To me, this would make it much easier and more efficient to enable/disable the super, instead of it being a third joystick.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Brock and Jessie too
---
Ahh you mean in that sense ..... yeah that i agree with. 
---
Thought there was like matchmaking qwerk if you kept playing the same person over and over lol 
---
Remembering these times. If you get a Sparky, was a bad thing, you have just wasted your luck on an elixir waste lol 😂
---
Ah ok got it!XD
---
no really hwhat ranque
---
No. It’s up to the devs whether they want to put it in or not, whatever they think is better for the game.
---
Yeah. For me it works with brawlers with more than 500 trophies.
---
Sadly they didn't paid for them :(
---
It's just a suggestion
---
I think you can move probably
---
r/wooosh for the 43 trophy one. 
---
That basically it bro you just stated pure FACTS 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
No. Just one.
---
Definitely 
---
I already wrote
---
Pretty much 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Yeah, happened to me over 10 times in one hour play time. Easy solution close and reopen the game. 
---
It makes the game more pay to win. I remember when you couldn't even buy epics- and I miss it
---
I mean...this is already a really ftp friendly game
---
Well, they do have the tier system for better or for worse....
---
Tara is great in brawl ball
---
Weird flex but ok.
---
So another game mode can occupy the already filled 3rd mode? We rarely get bounty now.
---
Wait- so 3 more legendaries are coming?
---
**10/10!** I bought the Nita seasonal skin and I love it! Plus, it would feel even more exclusive if these skins were really **LIMITED EDITION** (right, /u/yyarn? 😉) and didn't come back for sale again. New skins could be made on subsequent special dates, pretty much like Clash of Clans has a different Christmas tree every year.
---
I have my legendary pull rate up to .2595 so I decided to just get him when he was in the shop.  He was my first legendary.  I have everyone else maxed at this point and have 6 or 7 brawlers with their star powers even and have never pulled a legendary from a box.  
---
we already asked more than a year, but sc is obstinate
---
I encountered 4 times frequently after every 2 3 games
---
This happened yesterday.
---
I was the colt.
---
Why can't there be more game slots?
---
We rarely get BB now 
---
I’ve done this way too many times
---
You could just pound his ass with El Primo...
---
Yesss
---
Not sure about that
---
Finally, and yet people are ok with shelly’s super, how fast it recharges and bull damage
---
Get Gud!
---
Deus Vault.
---
Funny 80 million people would disagree 
---
Of course it s not obvious that is a screenshot blured a little bit with the pixel effect
---
up 
---
Happens to me like 20 times per day. Really annoying that Supercell cant math.
---
You just crossed the two subreddits I'm subbed too. XD
---
Who should i make next?
---
Totally agree
---
Showdown would be so much better yo play
---
??? 30 dollars for a character that has a 0.2 - 0.01 / 3 to be unlocked its extremely reasonable. I feel like most of the people complaining are kids or people without a job. 30 dollars out of my paycheck for a game i enjoy playing isn’t bad, and its definitely not pay 2 win, its pay to advance. Leon is really not as overpowered as everyone makes him out to be, he has counters just like every brawler. I find spike and even crow to be stronger than Leon in many situations. Ya’ll just suck and need to stop complaining and just adapt.
---
WHAT ABOUT THE ONE SHE KILLED
---
The brawler concepts are real, they were found in the game files, just with no art assets to go along with them. This guy modded them into the game, with Shelly as a placeholder. Hope that answers your question.
---
They’re probably in a party with two mini’s and a powerhouse to get easier matchmaking. 
---
Yeah, like all three players switch each with their own idea of which brawler would fit better with the current team. Then you end up with a bad comp, and one guy switched to a brawler with really high trophies so your matchmaking is screwed. 
---
That's awesome!!
---
Yeah I know he did it and stuff just want sure if it was real or not. Thanks :)
---
Also is the chef Mike skin actually coming?
---
Not my type then I like to be up close and do damage even doing poke he barely does anything might be good to finish someone off
---
Looks fine to me /s
---
What is this gorgeous piece i am looking at?
---
It happens sometimes. Duplicate brawlers when there should only be one of each. I got it.
---
One friend of mine played with another Frank (a random) on Brawl Ball with another friend. Kinda bug exploit that was, 6 wins on a row, I was spectator on em all.
---
yes please, i'll buy 10 xD
---
swear to god Colt is my hubris. Get demolished by him everytime. Versus all others I do well when they walk in the bushbut Colt? Nah, like somthing triggers inside me and my reaction exceeds 18 seconds so I just die.
---
12 yr old kids: *OMG HACKER. MOMMYYY!!*
---
Wtf, i try to made a bull meme twice now. Double shutdown.
---
Bo is teaching Shelly’s tits. 
---
META and overpowered are too different things. Bull’s strengths play directly toward Heist’s win condition, so he’s definitely good, but he isn’t broken by any means.
---
Selfie Time! everyone, Here's my submission,  It was soo fun creating this! just glad i wasnt late 😁😁

---
A-maze-thing!
---
I thought its obvious.For first he requires no skill to play so you just sit in the bush waiting for ANY brawler who will come near and than spam auto aim,he is undefeatable in close combat and its impossible to check everysingle bush in showdown while your escaping or even searching for chests,he is decent in gem grab due to his tanky health which can be used to just steal gems/kill gem carriers so he is fucking disgusting in showdown while also being unbalanced on heist,he can just use his super to get to the safe and immediately deal 27% demege and than probably another 27% after few dodges and reload.i dont play brawl ball so i dont know hows he doing there,he is bad at bounty cuz he cant camp.before you start arguing tell me,how to caunter him in solo showdown and heist with randoms?i think thats the reason why in each solo showdown youll face at least,if your lucky 3 of them (usually theres like 6 of them) and he is the most used character in the game.sorry for all mistakes im still learning english
---
Thnks  ibinstock 😱😱😍😍
---
LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE
---
Why does reddit users waste their time and others . Just press the damn home screen and tap on events again. Post a real problem sheesh
---
Nobody dares ruffle his feathers anymore
---
I'm playing on over 400 trophys but it still happens
---
Hope some day!!!
---
All the 22 are present here! 
---
I've had this happen and I die or lose games bc of it, albiet it's rare
---
Hope some day 💪🏼💪🏼
---
What device are  you using?
---
But why tho? Not violating any rules? 
---
His super has pretty long range relative to his basic attack. Try to line up multiple enemies in one shot
---
Rip my man
---
Ok this is epic.
---
Oh...guess I should've rematched instead of screenshotting.
---
Bro your a legend with him I'm only at rank 15 and mines is power 4.
---
I can’t find the original reddit post but here is another statement by the support team. https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/6jv23g/just_got_this_answar_from_br_support_smh_supercell/
---
This is a fake account he's reposting from u/tnns_beast22
---
Reminds me of what they did to Taric in League of Legends. He went from Black to weird white guy. 
---
I don't think so. He's actually an extremely powerful character so I guess it'll take a few nerfs to get him useless, and I still don't think he'll ever be an useless character. Remember he's legendary.
---
....so how do you caunter this instant 30% at your safe and bush camping in solo SD?
---
The lighting is fucked up, that's it 😂
---
Naaaaaaah not necessarily. Just when it can be a bully or OP strat. X2 Frank and a Bull (I think it was that, let me check it now) was OP OP strat and free wins. X2 Brock would be good on bounty
---
Sans OP
---
Oh jeez I just saw it was on bounty XDDDDDDD that would be OP
---
It is if enough people do it.
---
No Bull ? It's clearly Photoshoped
---
Thank you!
---
Looks like Kung Fu Panda's friend
---
Finally,someone made it!!
---
OOOOOHHHH ITS SANS BRAWL STARS!!!1!!1!1!1!!
---
i won 4 times in a row until 1 person left 
---
xD
---
To be honest I was looking at the new one thinking it was old, and thinking these are actually pretty good! Then realized that they were new and got disappointed.
---
Not suicidel?
---
This is really well done!   To add more awesomeness, if there were a larger blade coming at you from the top left corner giving it a 3D perspective, it would be even more awesome-r.
---
&gt; cause when reaching a special lvl (2400 trophies currently) you cant play with random mates.
---
Why not? I'm not much higher than you at ~3200. But I play 100% with randoms. I'm also not high enough in trophies with any one brawler to start seeing teaming in showdown. I've seen it in maybe a couple matches.
---
Great for you man! Yall should grow up, no one appreciates your toxic behavior. 
---
No!! Then his star power will be completely useless!! It's better this way
---
Not necessarily. Bull’s game is to press as far close to you as possible. If you look at a brawler like Dynamike or Barley, their game is all about avoidance. Avoid the Bull, pressure the Mike.
---
But is that chameleon ok
---
I got bull on over 400 and i meet teaming people every match
---
Which ones?
---
I wish I could art
---
Old mortis was better
---
Better than actually :))))))
---
Thanks for acknowledging that :/
---
Reminds me of venom
---
Cool, ill look you up later
---
Hahah that easy? 
---
Yea,shore
---
Wastet
---
It built new curse proof legs
---
This subreddit has about one type of meme and that consists of a damn bull camping in a bush
---
Ok thanks
---
For real on that Crow voice rework. Hate how he sounds like one of those high pitched annoying parrots.
---
Haha thats amazing good use of this template, legit laughed out.
---
Very nice! I wish I still had all my old legos lying around, I’d love to make all the brawlers xD
---
Damn hot
---
Ciao 
---
Something like that. I think there were 7, one died in 10th
---
Should probably focus on your other brawlers then.   
---
But yeah, don't expect a fix for that unless you can think of a solution. People have been trying for months with no luck.
---
Friend
---
I’ve got matched with 700+ with brawlers below 500 and that skill gap is a lot. 
---
Pretty sure star player gives 1 extra trophy. So if you'd earn 6 for winning gem grab the star player on the team would get 7 trophies. (numbers off the top of my head but I'm 99% sure Star Player gives 1 extra trophy.)
---
Nice work!
---
I was just about to comment on the back and forth lol 
---
I wouldn't call this low effort. Low effort would be just downloading an image and uploading it.
---
Colt need help
---
Yeah i updated one yesterday, the main problem with the old version was it felt too cramped but i made it work but then that added room made it easier, plus pixelcrux gave me the ability to turn my old maps into the new format by just adding 4 tiles and i slided my walls over and adjusted room. Im not sure how barrel fields will adjust though because it perfectly fitted the old version but maybe i will add two more lanes or re make the walls at the sides. I can send you the new version of the map i made yesterday.
---
If you wanna play with me BE ON
---
Spika spika spika
---
C A A A W W W
---
Is this hand drawn or edited?
---
While everyone talks about Shellies I just cared about the Dynamike Chef skin. Chefmike
---
Ok just a sec
---
They only made that much because of the Leon offer
---
No shit,it was a true Wolverine skin?????
---
Yes :)
---
They speak for the trees. All the trees’ pain is in their attacks.
---
There must be some reason why?? That's all I'm asking
---
Steampunk Jessie would be cool. 
---
It would be even better if you put El Primo. 
---
I do not understand why they have a picture of themselves filming themselves
---
I feel it’s a more accurate comparison to have old Mortis and hat Mortis together, but I’ll keep that in mind
---
Same buddy. 3800 trophies in. I'm going to be real disappointed when my next brawler is Mortis :V
---
Scrolling trough as I spark up a fat one. 
---
3 gems on 2 carriers and 7 on rico.
---
You won.
---
Looks like he's the one carrying the team mate.
---
But then what's the point of calling him leon
---
The only good bull meme I've seen,that isnt low effort
---
So poll party ziggs? 
---
Nope
---
Congrats! What did you get?
---
I think Buck is alright as he is, he’s just incredibly powerful at a close range so everyone has to pre-fire every single bush. It’s not so much a problem with buck as it is the way the game is made. But that’s just my opinion 
---
No my Mortis is level 6
---
That's the point, he's supposed to be old, not hip
---
Maybe because he thinks its a "joke"
---
Yikes 
---
nice teaming...
---
And  it will be... getting back those trophies
---
This is the oldest and the worst brawl stars ship and i dont understand
---
#why people still doing thats CRAP!
---
No.
---
One for my boi Darryl
---
Thank you for liking the idea
---
Thanks for your opion...
---
Cause i like it...
---
True, True
---
piper is op in heist if younow how to use her together with mortis
---
Your getting mixed up with bull, buck is actually op
---
Nah he’s pretty balanced. Maybe if people complain about nothing enough, he’ll get a nerf anyway.
---
Oh. I haven’t played Darryl in 3 months
---
not really he just needs to shut the fuck up
---
Showdown doesnt require skill to begin with...
---
Don't take it personally, i just don't understand why people still doing this ship, its come from old brawl stars and it die. But someone after global want to bring this old shit back. Why
---
Ok then,so you dont like cause is old
---
then,say you a new ship from the NEW BRAWL STARS
---
Can you daniel?
---
Very cool!
---
One of my friends has all brawlers except Leon, the other has all the Mythics, and here I am with... a super rare. Yay.
---
Lol all good 
---
As a mediocre Leon player, if Leons annoy you just play El Primo. He and Bull are probably the best counters there are rn
---
There we see one green forest with one log without leaves
---
Money
---
I agree with a lot of your points there I’m just really frustrated how I can’t use some of my favourite characters cuz either I will lose trophies or they will just reset
---
The most popular is ricochet and piper.
---
Also pam and bull is not bad
---
My proposition is shelly and nita :3
---
aaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
It's called lag.
---
JUSTICE R- o wait this is brawl stars, I saw ult :(
---
Sans
---
No it’s not necessarily saving up brawl boxes. It’s more just taking the 100+ brawl boxes that they have on their maxed account to hopefully get the newly released brawler.
---
I’m a better crow than spike
---
I wish I got Spike since the inevitable Leon nerf will make him bad.  Also, I've had the game only since global because I live in the U.S.A.
---
Ye Xd
---
Not much of an achievement but I got flack for only ranking up Nita when I started playing so I decided to rank everyone up to 10 and passively get them all to 20, just wanted to share.
---
Wtf? The locked movement control is already on and thats only for movement control (or the blue joystick)

Research before u comment kiddo

Also, for the record, power 1 mortis was a pain to play solo to rank 10

HTC one m7 2gb RAM 5.0.2 the game ran smoothly untill the opcional update so yeah

I got Leon from the season bonus, I’m happy as scared since it’s obvious supercell will obviously hit Leon in the near future with a nerf hammer 
---
Lol yeah I wanted to see if anyone noticed😂
---
Haha I know 
---
Imagine his flexibility if he was using jeans shorts. 
---
Maybe It will be her normal bullet, or make the bullet invisible but you can see the outline of it
---
Sorry man, im kinda ticked off right now
---
Added to the game the same day as the Barley revamp. Since there wasn’t an older model for Wizard Barley I didn’t include it.
