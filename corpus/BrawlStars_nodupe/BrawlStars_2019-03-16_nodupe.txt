Thank you! ü§©

Hope some developer see this, it's the dream brawler 
---
NP bb üòò

Not really, Mike has many hardcounters right now. Pam on the other hand is the best Brawler in the game.
---
Please no. 
---

Resch 3000 trophies then

It was actually available for free for me. It looks so much better than default one üòâ

We need a Star Lord Colt

Yes... keep going.

Yeah the skin was free if you played it in 2018 but I am curious how many people did

It's no shit Sherlock, DoNT bE A SiSsY!

Hella funny

At first i thought Spike was just the holes created by the bombs
---
Is it based on Void Termina? ;)
---
[removed]
---
You never heard of a retuning pickaxe? It was used by lumberjacks in the 19th who had to walk long distances to get to the tree they were cutting down and they would use pickaxes which they could retune and repair without walking all the way back to their cabins. 
---
I don‚Äôt think you understood that I have 2 legendary‚Äôs but all I wanted was bo :|
---
Damn, i think i‚Äôd like tara beter than Gena tbh
---
#Leona
---
I wondered about this too! Supercell games have always been really popular, and the switch already has some ‚Äúapps‚Äù as download only games. However, I don‚Äôt know if Nintendo would do it or if the joysticks would provide an unfair advantage
---
yuck
---
This is a good idea but I see a few problems:
---
‚Ä¢Shelly and colts super doesnt make sense to break the bridge since it's on the ground
---
‚Ä¢What would happen if someone triggered bo's bombs while on the bridge? If the bomb was right in the center of the bridge the knockback wouldnt be a big enough knockback to push a brawler completely off the bridge. (This problem could happen with basically any super)
---
pls no
---
bruh says the camper
---
Happy birthday to you too
---
Yump and Bobby were making fun of everyone on reddit saying buff crow, calling them a "bunch of 3ks"
---
Unless the bridge is raised up and they are not as high as it so they could destroy it
---
F
---
THIS IS SO GOOD!
---
how cqn my posts get 500 upvotes and this AMAZING thing, only has 100 upvotes?
---
Thats sad :(
---
I only got those brawlers and 2 star powers
---
But night witch Morris
---
People say that girls don't poop, but Piper is actually pooping bombs, so y'all wrong
---
Cries in 0.03%

I have

Idk why people can‚Äôt just compare usernames
---
i havent get any brawler to lvl 9 yet so i cant get star powers yet, should i wait for that to spend my gems on mega boxes??
---
Superglue

For those who didn‚Äôt know, health is 440, attack 640, and super 600 per swing. star power lets him throw faster.

That spike 8n the background is at an interesting angle.

Yes. This is a good idea and easy to fix the mechanics of. 
---
When I play Frank I only autoaim in point-blank range

They need to remodel her first before she gets skins

There is no joke, you can't go around saying false statements and claiming it being a joke.

RARR
---
Can you upload the replay?
---
Yes, all my star powers have been from those, you have a high chance of getting them
---
so Leon √ó Nita is REAL?! 
---
Yeah, I love that song and Ricardo just makes it better (in the amv vers.)
---
Way to steal my post lol
---
That is if they want to team with you or a manner of BM
---
You're so late dude

ikr, 10% or something

Can I get a trending on r/Brawlstars that isn't u/GEDI-KOR. Like no offense, but just start your own damn sub already.

Thanks is my post

Thanks it‚Äôs my post

RaR
---
That's funny because a few days ago I came up with a junker named Alex
---
Who uses a mech instead of a turret 
---
This guy stole my post
---
She doesn't need a nerf, if you want to deal with her, just attack her from range and avoid unchecked bushes. Also, make sure to slightly back away if she has her super because it doesn't do much damage at far range.
---
please crop 
---
More like a week
---
Whats your super rare chance?

A wild Shelly with the Super appears.

Hi Primo, Bye Primo...

I close the app after 2 consecutive loses ‚òπÔ∏è

Poor guy got killed by a six elexer Leon later on
---
*Crow
---
He is really good  in Siege Nuts&amp;Bolts if you know what to do. Won 5 in a row to get my frank to rank 20 with no-one on my team having star powers. Just need to experiment with different lineups and mic up with your teammates.
---
I already have crow and it‚Äôs still 200. I already have 70 gems but I still wouldn‚Äôt spend another $10 to get it, especially when I‚Äôve already spent way too much money on this game. 
---
#Thicc Barley
---
Good, #stopthespin 
---
Hmmm yeah I noticed... was accidental  @_@
---
Clash of clans is the worst. I could spent $20 just for 1 upgrade on that game.
---
Bet- they suck so much at their own game that they have to spin to win. 
---
Nice! Time to uninstall this...
---
‚ÄúCreature of da nite‚Äù -Mortis 
---
I wondered that when I saw him as well.  My only answer is he uses a spirit bow of his ancient ancestors to fire exploding arrows.
---
Love the design ,but maybe you should change the main attack its kind of the same as crows main attack
---
Randoms disagree
---
I notice that too, Nita generally seems to be the most aggressive brawler lol

Yeah

Clash of clans
---
I have crow and I got an offer for just the skin, 
---
yeah I know that people above 3k trophies can‚Äôt be matched with new players but they are NEW to those brawlers when I played 30+ matches with dyna, and I‚Äôm not full of myself I can hardly brag over a brawler less than 500 trophies
---
The skin costs 200 gems for me. So just over $10.

(Except Shelly‚Äôs super.)

560 gems? I‚Äôve been playing since global release and I only have 48
---
I love it!!!he looks so coo- wait...where is he?
---
They are trying to team 
---
If you have all of the brawlers? Hell yeah. If not then just wait for the next legendary and hope that you have 500 gems for it. 
---
NO NERF PAM HOLY SHITCBCBDICJFBD

But they could still use his ideas with permission of course.

Buff Crow

Oh my god that is so hecking cute ! :3 love the idea 
---
This enigmatic creature just appeared in town one day. Nobody dares ruffle his feathers - not anymore.
---
Dynamikes like this post
---
One Punch Primo 
---
First off, what, how so
---
The super sounds quite boring, what's the gameplay involved if it just follows you around? Don't even have to aim it?
---
Nita just chases you around half the match. She has a very flat damage, so she can constantly injure. 
---
Nice! Lel I Made a Map Of Feast Or Famine A Month Ago... Good Job on Building this!

it‚Äôs kinda like a dislike but it actually does something. Comments with high downvotes are shown at the very bottom.

You should have put "Crow doesn't need a buff"

Spike is waiting for piper to land

Hey spike

Where are the air pods hahahahah

Happy cake day

I think this view will be use in replay. If it adjust in game, many phone will be die.

Thank you for nerfing the spawners in Boss Fight! It was impossible to defeat any of them under like 2: 30.
---
Thanks!!
---
Barley: Help me
---
Power 10 Gene's and Leon's. Only true OGs will know whu
---
I do understand that what you are trying to say is that you can change what map to play. But this idea would work horribly, with only such a large playerbase and a specific matchmaking system. Getting in a game would take forever.
---
only OGs will remember before carl was in the game
---
Spike seems really happy tho
---
The point of the middle in this map, is that you shouldn‚Äôt go to the middle unless the gas forces you to. If you DO happen to get trapped, I don‚Äôt think you can be killed, since a thrower won‚Äôt have long enough range if you run
---
Maybe I'm blind.... But the only posts related to Carl that  I've seen so far have been these posts mocking how there are so many people posting about Carl :/
---
Shellys man.... Shellys... 
---
Nope
---
Shelly is garbage on this map.
---
Why. Write this up in a better format next time so somebody can actually understand it
---
I dont think there is anyone who doesnt know one punch man already ps-(one punch man season 2 coming in a month or so
---
We need more teir lists for brawl stars characters 
---
I posted the same thing yesterday and got a lot of shit about it. 
---
Feels bad man
---
We make fun of them but we owe them a lot, if they didn't spend money on the game we wouldn't be able to play for free. 
---
THEY NEED TO HIRE YOU
---
From her B U T  T  Y
---
Me with my -100 nita
---
every time I play Brawl Stars, I am disgusted by the matchmaking. It is completely horrible and can‚Äôt go up trophies simply because my teammates are so low leveled and with low trophies, and the enemies are so much higher than my teammates to the point that we don‚Äôt stand a chance. At this point it‚Äôs turning like fortnite, they keep on adding new things and they haven‚Äôt focused on fixing their own bugs and I am sick of it. I might just plan on deleting the game and stop waiting my time.

Watch the video before commenting something stupid.

The whole video is in this view, fully animated while playing and everything. It seems impossible for him to do something like this, unless of course, supercell implemented it.

Google.com type in reverse image search

I already have crow,So mine is 0.0333
---
99% of Pams. Atleast 300-450 trophies. It's also always Nita for whatever reason.
---
Hehe 
---
Same but usually I just share chests and run away unless a third brawler comes near. No reason to stick around and actually team.
---
:/
---
Awesome idea

It's trying to say 1000 dude.....

Well you just got two new brawlers, so that should be some trophy gain.

looks like musketeer from clash royale

How many trophies does ur dyna have?

False statement right there

i f***ing wish but no

Im sorry if you see my comment again is that this place is unknow to me, my question is if el primo Will extend the rank?

dynamike(star power) and darryl OP
---
Capitalism at it's finest
---
If you use a capitalized r it doesn‚Äôt link to the subreddit. You mean r/animememes.
---
That said, r/animemes is a contraction, and it looks better. Contractions are not bad english.
---
Hi hehhehehehh
---
Yeah definitely dont wanna stick around too long together, otherwise things can get dangerous
---
I'm not saying we should, it was a joke. My favorite mode is actually showdown!
---
If crow can manage it he won't forgive gameplay wise either, it's just smartest as crow to play careful so usually sitting behind a wall is good for cooling him down, since it's not good to sit around like that too long as crow, too easy to get pincered and killed. But if crow can manage it it's best to just keep chipping away at the other guy, not even necessarily to kill them, but just charging up the super itself is super valuable.
---
I feel like I messed up on the outfit, sorry about that :/
---
Do it on a computer or device of some sort 
---
Now old tf up
---
**rar**
---
My current reward says it‚Äôs based on 9750 but I pushed to over 11k. What‚Äôs up with this??
---
I tilted myself down but my reward changed
---
You didn‚Äôt get 5, you got 10. One pull is only about 15 power points or 40 gold. So the extra pills stacked onto a fewer number of rewards but the quantity is thill there. 
---
How do you even got negative gem
---
I really want to send them as a video but it takes so long

I don't mean to laugh but... lol, wtf happened?

i'm created a second account 5 january 2019 and i'm got this skin...
---
I agree
---
That was sarcasm..... But okay
---
crow
---
It was a mode modifier that would stop teaming, it would slowly drain hp. And to gain back hp, you would need to inflict damage. So it's like inflict damage gain health, like Mortis's super
---
Pytin vodka balalaika
---
Rip to the player who spawns in the middle
---
I have 2 accounts... took me 60-70 times on first account and on 2nd account I got it within 5... 
---
does the star power for a brawler always stay in the shop if you can only get one? Like my Jessie is my only power 9 so will her star power stay there until i get it?
---
Underrated post.

That is also true

---
Whats ur total trophy count?
---
Awesome
---
?
---
I will not stop spinning till crow gets a buff
---
If someone bought that skin, its understandable.
---
Alright so... One of the kids around me purchases few starter packs. It had mega boxes and gems in it. I asked for a refund but didn't get a reply quick enough. So I was like, "darn it! I'll just spend those gems". Now, as it happens I got the refund. But, Supercell took back the gems and the gem amount for the mega boxes (since they can't actually take back the items I got in the mega boxes). Hence the -1000 gems. Sigh. 
---
you are leon with super. where is my $1.000.000?
---
Mentioned my story in another comment. See! 
---
*Runs*
---
50/50 either happens or it doesn‚Äôt
---
i'd love to see the mode they are playing too
---
7721 trophys fam. Whats you count like?
---
yes it says bounty invite
---
Actually this skin is not so rare, it was obtainable some month ago, just wait and ask the same question in few years and you will see ;)
---
(Same thing for Brawlidays 2018 skins)
---
OEoufDFf
---
Ok mr. pay to play just buy gold like you do and you good
---
7747 :/ all brawlers but no gene and legendaries 
---
***Yeah***
---
Yeah its is annoying when everyone targets u. Bt deep inside we all know that we target the ones with higher power cubes as possible. Its every brawler for himself so u know what to do the best for u to win. 
---
r/crowgang 
---
r/BrawlRecruit   and read the rules
---
My luck is so bad but so good that i got my mythics early. So my legendary rating was ass lmao. All i need now is piper, crow and spike.
---
ive been playing since beta and aint no p2p player
---
Noice
---
Dude same i got mortis and tara at 2k&gt;
---
it would be great if spectate can also know the game mode
---
but a little bit off topic here lol
---
He actually throws it
---
Haha same  and i got mine the same day.
---
Nope it will disappear if you don't buy it. It will reappear, but I'm not sure how often. 
---
I just watched the video, seems like RadicalRosh had a special camera angle/edits
---
showdown?
---
:( nice
---
Ahh ok then you fine brother
---
i don't like videos when there is no sound in them
---
From clash royale anniversary.
---
Your just unlucky :(
---
I think that Leon was probably mad and paying respect at the same time.
---
Same
---
nop, Mortis and El Primo will have a hard time
---
BUFF CROW
---
But I listen to music instead of the game sounds
---
r/crowgang dropped the offer for ya
---
Maybe someone doesn‚Äôt like the music that I listen to:)
---
Hope you get a legendary soon :3
---
That‚Äôs supercell for ya 
---
I mean its probably because you use dynamike in solos....
---
Tru that
---
0.08 üòÇüòê what were your odds before you got leon?
---
~~My meme that I worked on for 20 minutes is ‚Äúlow effort and doesn‚Äôt encourage discussion‚Äù but this is completely fine~~.
---
NOT. NIGHT. WITCH. MORTI. 
---
She has the highest dps in the game, a lot of health, long range, it's almost impossible to escape from her attack, and her super heals her over time, and she has a fast reload speed. She is pretty OP. The thing that keeps her from being extremely OP is her slow attack speed.
---
r/woosh IDIOT! LOL
---
r/crowgang fell because of dynamike 
---
have a good day m8, keep racking up them karma!
---
You comment if every post I‚Äôm commenting on
---
Why is Carl even a thing?
---
My meme that I worked 20 minutes on gets taken down because it‚Äôs ‚Äúlow effort and doesn‚Äôt encourage discussions‚Äù but apparently this is fine. That‚Äôs so unfair.
---
My odds were 0.0824? Something like that my rating is 0.0254 now. 
---
r/crowgang dropped the deal for ya
---
The only two words I could understand was team and showdown so... 
---
Alrighty then kiddo
---
Jeez. I have that mega box coming up at 8k hopefully that will give me something good
---
They have to build hype ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Lo que mas me importa es que el juego lo tienes en espa√±ol :v
---
I got an offer for just the skin for like 200 gems and I bought it cause my gems are basically all just for skins now and I happened to have 250 gems 
---
Pretty cool
---
THANKS!

---
Fly over walls? What's to stop staying in a 2x2 (or more) clump of walls? Seems a bit unfair in showdown/big brawler
---
r/BrawlRecruit and read the rules
---
Right, I forgot it even happened
---
How are people still not getting old of this overused and very false joke
---
Hoopy loopy cake day! I missed mine :c
---
lmao when i clicked play i noticed that i have 69 trophies so i died to take the pic but you get trophies for anything in this trophy range 
---
Sorry but I didn't know
---
Spike finna stick his fork in her

Lol he is turkish like me

She's 19 or 20,her description says that she graduated

Maybe cuz I was first ?

Sorry if its small. its my first time posting a picture

Hey guys have you seen Leon? He said he was gonna meet spike with something and i just saw spike and Leon wasn't there 
---
Also why is piper bent down and screaming in a weird way? Wait.......oh.......oh.no.................................
---
CALL THE GHOSTBUSTERS WE GOT A GHOST HARRASING PIPER
---
No I posted like a few days ago
---
Nevermind, I was wrong. 
---
It‚Äôs just luck based most of the times . One day you can win 40 trophies teaming or camping but the next day you can lose 50 bc of backstabbing or a bad place to spawn. 
---
19h and I did 22h so yeah.
---
Yeah but with 300 gems you can buy a lot of cool skin
---
ü§£ü§£
---
Wow. So now i tried it again and it locked me.
---
Iam uninstalling this game..

*Penny approves*

The drone should be named K.A.I.R.O.S

This is an idea I‚Äôve had for a whopping 3 months since Brawl Stars globally launched but quite surprised that nobody has in common.

Use vc

Teaming with shelly that has 20 power cubes and a super

Are you David Irving, Holocaust denier?
---
Fat mood
---
She‚Äôs gonna get a remodel. I don‚Äôt know when, but she is along with Bo, Pam, and a few other brawlers. So, they might change that in her remodel.
---
Knowing crow, He probably died from the colt
---
How many trophies do you have on your Mortis and what power level?
---
Sounds like something a NOOB would say (jk)

Its HUABABJAJABA time

ugh forgot about that too i‚Äôm waiting for his appearance in earth for a long time he gonna blow up pirates and the navy‚Äô  minds 
---
That feeling when you complain on randoms at 3k. I bet you will suicide when you reach 10k and play randoms 
---
Hi,
---
I have a question, how much time do you spend for a new Brawler?
---
***crying***

No. If supercell were to implement a report function it would be abused and they would have no way to tell the those who are reported are actually teaming without watching 1000s of replays just to temp ban someone.
---
Seriously though, I really need this.
---
Asians First? 
---
He no longer spins, HE IS THE SPIN
---
That sucks lol 
---
Concept is good, but dynamike and barley are going to dominate
---
No I've been here since global. No one calls it elexir
---
More like Colt Skywalker
---
In female form!
---
This is amazing
---
I got two colts 
---
Well then teams will team with other teams and make it even more unfair 
---
Happened to me yesterday too! Destroyed the enemy tresor mostly by myself and managed to kill brook and jessie as poco.
---
I'm assuming it takes time to update the list or they check your stats to confirm it was not a glitch
---
Wow. Just amazing. 
---
No, it's actually: two birds, one guy who seriously needs to spin.
---
That have happened to me, we were 3 coltsüòÇüòÇ

Add tons of meta posts.

I wonder how many paper cuts Tara has after throwing those cards.

We should throw a party for carl

How about a little more?

Before global, it used to be called elixir for a long while.
---
Looks awesome, I love this
---
I got Tara from a Big Box sitting on the toilet so get on my level.
---
 What is after Insane?
---
voice chat
---
I do.
---
Omg this could be fun, still better than Carl 
---
*Waiting for Darryl*
---
The beta players normally call it elixir, but now to understand everyone with each other we call it power cubes
---
Petition for each Brawler to have their own loading screen when going into battle.
---
Can I have in the next a legendary?
---
Quick thinking by your teammate wp!
---
Damn, now your Luck is -4.1937 %
---
Any general tips on how to beat it? Stuck on Insane here. Threw a good 15 tickets at it before I realized I‚Äôm a good bit passed when I should‚Äôve already gone to sleep.

For the robot for the mode siege

Underrated comment

Thankos dude!, Coming soon Skin for Barley! ^^

Just keep trying to get dual pam

Throwers be cryin rn.

it's back lol
---
I cleared INSANE in less than 7 mins
---
I bought that yesterday. It's a good deal tho.
---
Sick
---
Do you have maxed brawlers? colt, bull and pam. (El primo if you have it anyway) Use them Maxed brawlers give you the best advantage you can get in Boss fight
---
cool idea! and cool result!!
---
Oh that's hot - Will Smith
---
L
---
This brawler need nerf:
---
Pam speed
---
Shelly damage
---
Jessie torret
---
And this need buff:
---
Darryl life
---
Mortis speed
---
Crow damage 
---
Am I the only one who spins, but not to team? Like as a truce, "I'll leave you alone, pls leave me alone. We okay bro?" Even the next time we meet, we don't kill each other and split ways(but never fights alongside each other).
---
This is actually the name,not jump pads or launch pads.
---
Bruh sound effect
---
Yeah saw a post of that already recently 
---
Lmao
---
Welcome to r/mortisgang

except that crow eventually kill you :(
---
O sweet baby Jesus!

Didn't see that.
---
Life of a poco
---
Not sure what it is so I just made up a number 
---
Oh,so original,look at mobile legends,they uave it from like season 1.
---
Ur name in game and ur post 
---
Thanks man
---
Hey man hahaha thanks
---
Lol, bit he is my main in Gem Grab only, I don't like a brawler more than others in other modes, except showdown (bush camping brawlers).
---
And he has more range 
---
Actually good strat
---
Good point, just think that players that struggle getting star tokens shouldn‚Äôt be left out.
---
You're actually not the only one experiencing this problem nor the #1 Gene. Korean dude (current global #1) is #1 for Gene currently
---
Literally
---
you can still blame the other guy
---
Yeah, I pushes my poco to 410 with gemgrab, after that i got his starpower and after that everything went downhill after that
---
‚ÄåIf you add Tpk (Trophy per kill) teaming WILL be less efective because people won't see teammate but free trophy (or 2 if count placement) and why just don't kill him? Also showdown now is not good for pushing why? Look at this from that side on siege you lose 20 trophies in 5/6 minutes and you can get them back in 5/6 minutes on gem frab, heist, brawl ball it's little bit random but still in about 4 minutes you lose 15 and you get 15 back in 4 minutes too. Now look at showdown you lose 21 trophies in 1 minute and to get them back you have to spend at least 4 minutes. I know you can win and win and win back to back but on 3v3 too so Tpk could make it more worth to play and more dynamic (sorry for bad speeling) Just add it for a month and ask people what tyey think :D ALSO bring back life leech bye :D
---
Yeah, I get you're point here. But there's better way to execute it. Not a bad idea, just not a fan of it myself.
---
You my friend are going places 
---
Lol I could second your thought hahaha.
---
I dont have any friends
---
The day of global release :)
---
Thank you sir for your honesty, now people will think you are really cool becsuse of your REAL high score
---
If I was that to 500, I wouldn't quit soon, I also have a lose streak to break. üò≠ If the streak doesn't end, I can't get Bo. I'm at 2.8k.
---
Veerryyy nice pls SUPERCELL take it.....
---
Post this idea man! And when you choose a brawler a tip comes on the loading screen for rico only. E.g Rico is a sharp shooter brawler, keep your distance! 
---
He‚Äôs the guy who creates the awesome skin concepts! I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve seen some of his designs pop up!
---
wait...both elexer and piwer cubes give the same amount of hp and dps
---
I‚Äôm at 4.4k try to play the brawlers you have lowest ranked, and just push them up in solo sd, most easy way to push a couple of trophies.
---
I was in the same boat this morning 
---
I had it too
---
I played piper and had two Frank mates
---
I can't buy but it would be funny...
---
Kairos, wtf you doing on here?
---
stolen 
---
u/vreddit_bot
---
I can relate very much because I can't seem to win in siege. I think I have lost 600 trophies overall so I've stopped playing it
---
It's a solid quality of life change, I don't see why anyone would be against this.
---
One punch PRIMO
---
I dont get why people still complain about Leon. He got nerfed. TWICE. What more could you ask for. Sure, he can be broken at times. But that's why he's a legendary in the first place. He was nerfed to balance the game. Not to make him unusable.
---
Probably cause Clash has elixir lol
---
That is some madness. But stupid me went ahead and lost 11 matches in a row anyway ;(
---
Great!I hope SC sees that!
---
Thanks üòÅ
---
Jester Leon?
---
No when you try to get star token in siege and lose 10 times in a row is when you dont have a good time
---
You get a *PINK HAIR STRIKE*
---
Oh he did
---
Stop playing sd. Problem solved ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
The day before global release
---
Wow, me too, hates it when that happens.
---
TBH some of my favorite showdown moments have been Finessing a group of teamers to knock them out all out.
---
Lol, yes he is 
---
If you have her star power T.T
---
Just Monika
---
Now just imagine if more good players were willing to play with randoms, the ratio wouldnt be so warped and the general random pool would get significantly better.

Mortis heaven
---
I got spike and crow from one free chest soo...
---
Maybe he could do free-lance work for them and get paid for concepts, instead of hired full time!
---
They should also add unbreakable bridges that are just for aesthetic purposes

Just insane atm. Gonna wait til my friends r ready to grind

#F
---
I got a random that i played 44 games with 
---
Nah, I‚Äôm just saying mega boxes are trash. Brawl boxes are the best 
---
That is normal, 890 power points will get her to the maximum level (level 9)
---
Huh... What can I say...
---
He‚Äôs the guy who creates these awesome skin concepts, you might have seen some of his designs pop up? If you sort by all-time top posts his designs are there! (Take the hint supercell!!!)
---
Perfection 
---
Hey I am 7.9K without legendary 
---
Mine is Penny, because of her splash attack, and her cannon is a real life saver. When I‚Äôm really low health and being chased, I drop my cannon and they usually stop and try to kill it first, letting me escape.
---
yes, i get addicted to worst shit ever, like this game...
---
why every good concept gets screwed by a shitty dev?
---
Shelly, because her super can beat every brawler and it charges very fast, and her star power is one of the best
---
OP thirsty much? 
---
Not really because the only way this would affect them was if there was another brawler right next to them and they decided to go after a brawler that is far away rather than the one that is closer
---
i do on never been that in such a way
---
Pull from a box or buy them.  I'm sure your gonna get a new one soon.  
---
And reload speed and the number of bullets per attack
---
Yepp he got all he wanted
---
Looks like s10
---
Whyüò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢
---
Her star power is a small boost, I have actually did it with someone without the star power too (and also when we were 3 Pam). The problem is you can't make a party only with Pam, so it's just lucky to find another Pam and do this strategy.
---

how did you find this post

Holy crow
---
I've noticed this issue for numerous updates, hopefully they'll notice it eventually and fix it. I like knowing how far my friends and clanmated are
---
I know it does a lot of damage at close range, but nobody will get close to a shelly unless you're playing heist or brawl ball, where you have to go to the enemy spawn to win. In gem grab and bounty, her super is fodder because of it's low range. Shelly's super isn't very good because it has low range.
---
When supercell released football bull, someone pointed out that people already drew a football design a while back, although that was most likely a coincidence 
---
I've not played siege for three rotations because the star token is not worth the list trophies

I want it to look **EAXCTLY** like this

Wow, I feel like I'm the one that wrote that. That's kinda exactly how I feel towards teamers, and I always say to myself that they're poisoning showdown.
---
Congrats legend 11111
---
I'm trying to convince them she needs a buff, actually.
---
Ngl I've recently learnt of the marvel known as solo showdown to climb (as opposed to playing with randoms that have a plankton for a brain), and teamers really really suck when you're chivalrous
---
Lol for me that was too much too handle i tagged him too many times bt he still wouldnt die

Pam should be in Team tier

Thats my shit. Hell yeah that would be amazing !

no she doesnt

Am i the only one that find it addicting?

Put wam bam here comes pam in it

but now we all know that Crow is more like little brothers than anything:

not strong, just *really* annoying

No no no it‚Äôs the r/crowgang that wants you to (they want you to join)

Which happens .0001 percent of the time

So for his attack he throws a disco ball and anything in the area gets damaged by the light? Wack

this is more wild than unlocking him

Maybe but I think it's a really good Idea thou

Are you serious!? Goddamn!

Doesn't happen on iOS, at least in my experience with 3 different phones

I think it is supercell's problem. Like -1000hp for Spin 2 times

GG, that was epic

It kinda makes the game easy and it‚Äôs so essential but it‚Äôs called solo showdown for a reason not team showdown. Fix your game, I don‚Äôt want to resort to teaming in a SOLO game mode

Don‚Äôt go invisible if a crow just poisoned, the poison will reveal you.

It's around that time when people actually get him probably 
---
U bad at dodging
---
This video looks familiar

This is a really cool skin! May you please make an Archer Queen skin for shelly/piper? :)
---
I literaly said in the title im not a teamer wtf is wrong with you?!?!?
---
Welp haha
---
I don't think that supercell has some lack of players issue, but whatever.
---
uh huh. suuuure checks comment above me*
---
right here officer
---
Half Bull, half Darryl.
---
Im not bad at dodging but their bullets deal a f ton of damage and im using spike (he has low hp)
---
Good to hear you liked it!
---
Ahem.
---
Rico
---
Weird flex, but ok
---
Oh say supercell would lose money due to free pheonix crows
---
3200 trophies and 18 Brawlers.
---
Then dont use spike
---
Do penny! Penheehee
---
Perfect
---
Supercell has to make skin portraits.Also nice job
---
This is my Idea mean
---
Atm rico and the leon one are amazing
---
Me: "No mom"
---
Lol what?
---
Yeah lots of people have been making spike jack of lantern skins, but this is one of the best!
---
KIMONO LEONNNNNN
---
And it'd be nice if Supercell buffed Crow.
---
It‚Äôs an excellent idea
---
Pls no
---
yeah, and you are in no place to say she needs a nerf.
---
Lvl 50 boss with level 10 goons. 
---
Get a team (with friends, not randoms), get as much damage before the bot goes angry, and try not to die.
---
Do it with friends cause if you don‚Äôt you have a chance of playing with like 2 bulls and bull is horrible for this mode imo
---
This looks sick!
---
\#buffshelly
---
I got my first mythic at 4k so stop crying

Step 2: Realise that your IKE is on 1% and the freaking Barley supers on it.
---
No they made tons of memes xD
---
Which brawler do you recommend? 
---
Also, do u think I need to be maxed power lvl?
---
And that's why there should be voice chat.
---
George is a mighty bounty hunter, killing his opponents with his trusty hunting rifle
---
As he says "i get to kill people AND i get paid for it. This job suits me perfectly"
---
Power level: 1.
---
Hitpoints : 3600 
---
Attack: Damage at max range 1450
---
Super: Flamin' Rifle
---
George puts up his rifle on fire. Increasing the number of ammo (from 3-6) and deals more damage until the 7 seconds pass.. or he spends his 6 bullets.
---
Star power: Fastest Hunter
---
Once you kill someone, your bullets travel faster AND deal more damage for 3 seconds
---
I would say yes

"Ok Ok! You got skills!"

True but not true.
---
Which brawlers do u think are the best for this mode?
---
Voice chat is a good alternative but it‚Äôs too heavy and Supercell doesn‚Äôt want Brawl Stars to exceed 200MB, which is the mark for apps that can update without WiFi connection.
---
Dinosaur Darryl, Disco Barley, ATM Rico and Carnival Pam
---
Still equivalent to: BUSHCAMPER
---
Awesome skin Idea!! Robullü§ñü§ñ
---
I want leon so bad
---
Pam, colt and jessie
---
I like playing Leon in it but if you don‚Äôt have him spike or penny

I just use my most tilted Brawler (that works for Siege best) and roll with it.  I'll get them trophies back...some day.

This looks amazing!! Great Job with the skin conceptsüòçüòò

Honestly i hate auto aim, i would remove it for players who reach 5K trophies or something like that.
---
maybe when you first star with jessie but later on you should not rely on these and instead get used to the range by playing more

And this is my favourite skin concept! \*nw mortis\* \*leaves\*
---
wow very low trophies :/
---
Burlley
---
I guess avoiding showdown is the best way.. the next best thing is having good premades and push together in other modes 
---
He deleted it, what did he say?
---
Gardening with Spike 101
---
Lol those are my low brawlers 
---
Raises his hand and bam
---
Hmmmmm. The things associated with this probably aren‚Äôt the things a kid friendly game want to associate with
---
Copy paste, I already seen this post with Leon and the GF saying "Have you seen my wallet" in the top posts of all time. 
---
The account is 300 trophies the brawler was at 0 trophies...
---
U could use the mirror tools cause ocd is killing me center isn't a sphere top right thing is not a exact mirror of the others 
---
Focus the minis, always be moving. use the sides of map that have lots of walls corners and after he had smashed everything, move. 
---
Probably the Veteran Colt and the Tiger Nita one
---
So that's what I mean did u see his other brawlers? 
---
No i‚Äôm not saying that, He could kill that bo if he tried to but he didn‚Äôt, ‚ÄòCause he wanted him to be #2, so it‚Äôs somehow TEAMING
---
The post was made one month ago.
---
Poco: Wow, that sucks!
---
Wow I think this is one of my favorites now!
---
Wait I finnaly understand forget it 
---
Nice repost zz
---
Wow
---
U probably have around 5k+ and got a team mate of 300 trophies only ahhh ok üòÇ 
---
#GoogleMyFist
---
That would give an unfair advantage to the beta players. I think it's annoying too, but Supercell will add more endgame content sometimes
---
That would be a cool looking skin in the game. Very impressive work. This will be my wall paper (if you don't mind) 
---
how can you prove it?
---
üôÉ
---
I just answered that... Of course i saw his other brawlers...
---
I don't mind that. 
---
What i mind is playing Robo Rumble, getting two shots off on a gray gunner and leaving it with *2 phucking health&amp;
---
People that are that high probably are pretty much maxed.
---
King Frank
---
That makes King noises
---
And shows the king emotes whenever he kills someone and when he dies
---
Sorry. Just can't decide. There might be a couple of ones that I just like, but I love most of them. He's a very talented guy. 
---
what
---
great meme
---
Show your friendly brawlers‚Äô ammo bars, like I suggested ;))
---
do you no whatvis cooler ?  your montage
---
Damn, this game looks more like league of legends /dota instead of new game. 
---
Es que vous pouvez mettre un code cr√©ateur dans la boutique de Brawl Stars 
---
Remodel is good 
---
Chicken Crow
---
It is Fake, also Supercell just nerfed the boss Fight pets. El primo Will NOT get a skin Before remodel.
---
Brock needs some milk 
---
yeah, my lowest are at 420 
---
That's real nice
---
He is making friends
---
It HAS to be Veteran Colt. LOOK AT HIM, HE'S SO BADASS
---
With all these great skin designers, people underestimate pencil works. But every design starts with a pencil sketch. Good job, keep it up. 
---
Skin: the sandals are Wrenches and the belt is a jumper cable
---
i like event but if you are not max brawlers...                       and rewards sucks
---
the average lifetime of a cactus I guess
---
Woah
---
Brawl stars' first release was two years ago... 
---
Ok But it has been in the game For over a half year For Now
---
Poco needs to be nerfed somehow, the range of his Attack is unbelievable. It is just a no skill brawler. The super heals half of the health, so it‚Äôs practically a revive
---
Those mortis's are teaming because they have no hat 
---
It was first released in 2016
---
Real canadian teams in showdown
---
He doesn't play showdown
---
I searched it and he has like 6000 trophies but just one 3v3 victory and 12 Solo Showdown victories lol
---
He only has 400 solo victories
---
720 For most brawlers. 770 For primo , frank and bull. 820 for Mortis , Crow and Leon 
---
(also mortis can be faster with dashing so he is #1)
---
contrary to popular belief most barleys dont condone teaming
---
This is epic!!! 
---
ATM Rico is too much SWAG lol
---
‚ÄúEpic Plays‚Äù ....trasshhhhh
---
He us op without energy
---
Yeah, i just realized these are the walls, not the actual ground :D
---
i bet it does show the range for penny‚Äôs mortar but it‚Äôs so big you can‚Äôt see it
---
Nice for seasonal skin. Great idea!!! 
---
Yes we'll your opinion is pretty much worthless to anyone but yourself 
---
I have seen your work on discord and I hope you keep it up because it is awsome
---
Lol
---
"trickytan" die yourself fat ass mrfu n√≠gga
---
Seriously every one is amazing 
---
This gave me anxiety
---
My brain tags teaming as "normal, pass" now...
---
That looks so cool!!! 
---
That's finr
---
When did you plan to fix the bug with darryl's Ultimate on Island Invasion Map?? 
---
Oh yeah on the newest seige map there was cover and some random blew it up i can relate
---
Nerf Poco? Nope, nope
---
mmmmmmmm Y E S
---
What is that
---
Petition for a Bull-Terminator skin.
---
No. You will get some throughout the week and get 2 free tickets when the event starts so it‚Äôs okay to use them all (:

Top 10 best anime crossovers of all time
---
Do you watch pewds?
---
i know
---
I noticed you put the three rockets on the launcher instead of four. Great skin too. I would buy it if it was in the game. 
---
the drawings are good but barely resemble shelly and colt
---
That's true, he was a little bit too dark
---
Dino Darell
---
Getting Mortis Star Power is not a waste of money. It‚Äôs so strong
---
Mecha bull is great
---
More like "Wall Law"
---
It is the worst for this game mode xD
---
Aww so cute a person who can't read. 
---
I play with Barley
---
How is getting Mortis Star Power a waste of money, it is arguably the strongest in the game.
---
Island Invasion is a good map.
---
Just Meteors suck. Bring back Life Leech and remove Meteors, and we are good
---
His skin is kinda dark green lol illuminaty confirmed 
---
What!?
---
I'm that freaking Barley
---
just like my legendary brawler chances
---
Agreed. I just wish the Buff Crow thing would just stop. Crow isn't that bad
---
NOTE:this gameplay video was in my second account 
---
Reeee
---
Yes that's the point :) but I'm understanding your reserves
---
Boohoo I don‚Äôt care you play el primo
---
The anxiety everytime you were low on life lol. One of the best gameplays I ever seen! 
---
Podr√≠as sacar a barley cascanueces por Navidad
---

---
What the heck was that hand going for? Nice clip
---
Amazing context
---
Smh. There isn‚Äôt even a chat button. So inaccurate. /s      Good artwork btw
---
the skins are called:bandita shelly, rockstar colt, golden barley and phoenix crow
---
i apoligise if this comment sounds rude to you, i realise you aren't a native English speaker and might get the names wrong due to translation

You're a cancer on this planet !

r/beetlejuicing
---
Honestly, I prefer Robo rumble for tokens and Big game for fun.
---
That is pretty good progress for a guy who joined at global
---
Mortis gang but username is pocomagicguitar. Hmmmmm.... ü§îü§î
---
Now make him plays Megalovania 
---
I did it once I was just experimenting around
---
This is too true
---
Oops, i dit not mean to do that.
---
The turret is only meant to show its range for allies not enemies. Right?
---
Rockstar poco &lt;3
---
#YOURE RIGHT I THINK THATS IT
---
If the language has the same Roman alphabet like English, it‚Äôs probably keep the original names. There are languages like Japanese, Russian, Korean, or Chinese that have different alphabetical systems. Brawler names will be written in that alphabet but generally it will still be pronounced the same or similarly to the English original. 
---
I'm subscribed to it already. It's good, I just wish the regular subreddit wasn't such a joke
---
I do know what that means. I just checked the dictionary definition it said ‚ÄúKairosGetsTheStix.‚Äù
---
Hi, please don't repost my stuff without letting me know first!
---
The Disco barley
---
Jessie or penny
---
I think it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre #BLACK
---
Clown Mortis ftw
---
You don‚Äôt even know how much trophies I have... you do realize that I have more trophies than you right? 
---
Poco's and mortis'
---
Below average, but don't give up!

CAVERN CHURN

kimono leon is fucking tuff 
---
In Spanish gene is called genio, but it is tranlation
---
Are you stupid? You are not a fucking robot who knows everything, you are a human who cannot perfectly tell the range of the turret (especially where the range is not written anywhere!). It would obviously make her a little bit stronger, there is no question.
---
r/BrawlRecruit
---
6000 trophies.. at exp level 5?
---
This is really good! Nice job!
---
Mainly while you're placing it
---
I feel the urge to apologize to you.

---
Oh only while placing not even while in play?
