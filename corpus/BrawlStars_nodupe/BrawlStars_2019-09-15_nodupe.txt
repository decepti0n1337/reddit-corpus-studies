When I immediately saw EMP, I thought it was inspired by Sombra from Overwatch

Ugh...dude this was sarcasm

You guys understand sarcasm huh?

r/AntiEmojiPolice i support your cause! would you like to fight the emoji police with me?
---
It would be much better if it gave the option.
---
Adiós amigos...
---
(Whistles)
---
👌 noice
---
Too dark for a game meant for kids
---
I played with Ricochet but I don't feel nostalgia, even though it was my favorite brawler at the time (and still is)
---
wanna help me fight the emoji police? join my cause and become a member of r/AntiEmojiPolice!
---
F
---
Let’s see this get added in with the next update
---
Both of his star powers are really good (smoke trails is better overall though)
---
#parry this you fucking casual
---
Splash splash your opinion is trash
---
First time I ever see someone dodge curveball, you are really good!
---
No? Star shelly is supposed to be limited to reward players that played since global launch. If they started giving it to everyone it would ruin the point.
---
I do 🙃
---
Why downvote?
---
What if there were team events for gold or gems. Like playing one of the modes between clubs
---
Yes. FinNaLlY some people who have it too..
---
Me
---
Colt looking very feminine
---
Below teamers is unlocking a new brawler
---
r/emojipolice
---
my friend got Leon at around 1k and she was like who is this
---
Yeah surely i like "Ricochet" and not "Riccochet"
---
I got Leon at 12000
---
I got spike like at 3k trophies im at amost 8k trophies
---
o no
---
wow... i guess i just got beginners luck!
---
Got two legends, crow at 7k and spike at 10k
---
What
---
The Bibi one is so true
---
And Rosa
---
So expensive
---
Dyna-Star power: 
---
HOLY SHI...VERY EASY o&lt;O)
---
u have crow and tara tho... im at 12k and dont even have tara or crow
---
If that’s the remodel, then rip
---
Bruh
---
Isn’t that just a better spike super? Love concept btw
---
u frickin serious! im at 12k trophies and still dont have spike, crow, gene and tara!
---
Very funny comic and well done overall, nice job
---
Press F to pay respects
---
thought i was the only one
---
So funny XD love it!
---
inb4 "oMg nO hAt MorTIs"
---
Thx! I’m planning to part 3 next
---
It doesnt fit his design
---
omg ur soo lucky
---
im at 12k and dont have spike leon tara and gene
---
Good luck
---
Ah ok that makes sense
---
bring me that ass
---
Heaps of people don't have legendaries at 10k and above you were MEGA lucky there
---
“90%” discount, but El Milos is 300 gems instead of 80 and sans Poco is discounted 1 gem lol
---
Great edit
---
Got leon at close to 2k and now 5.5k, have all brawlers except spike crow and 8 bit
---
Mexico’s ass
---
As rivals because there in different gangs.
---
Mortis and Shelly on certain solo maps
---
I got crow at 800 :/
---
Same exact story here 😂
---
I can see how donating is useless for the top clubs, but eventually Supercell has to stop putting wars in everything. Mainly because of the leeches and other people who just get the benefits by doing nothing.
---
I got mortis at about 1.2k
---
That's a bad idea for showdown think of the storm thats all over the map when he dies that's an extra 3 seconds of survival
---
Repost
---
I agree, what’s you highest
---
I didn't see nothing wrong, if crow lands "inside" the brawler the daggers will not go to far because they've already hit the opponent
---
I deleted the other one cuz I forgot to include Tara 😅

Oh yeah, nvm

Make it like ok clash of clans. If you don’t attack you don’t get any loot.
---
Tick is noobmaster 
---
Oof [mind blown]
---
What did he even say
---
Well I believe that I have made no infractions here as the n word in this case is being said by someone who clearly owns an n word pass and these are just the captions. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I am at 640 with Piper.
---
personally brawl ball is my favorite mode but i do think all modes should have their own slot but idk if the player base is high enough for it yet but i do understand if brawl ball isn’t you favorite or maybe your least favorite mode and you hate the new changes just supercell will always cater to the majority leaving someone unhappy but i totally get your point
---
It didn't happen with spikes remodel tho, it remained 80 gems even tho it looks way better
---
Mine is at 860
---
u/proxcreeper who did this?   One of the questions on the kid application was about not abusing your power.  Was that question there because of this incident?  I hope OP got unbanned.
---
Yeah, I understand if I’m one of the only people that hates this change, then I’m fine with the update. But I feel like there are actually a lot more people that HATE the game right now because of it.
---
SHUll
---
Same, I got Leon at 1900, I maded a another account, got spike at 1200 lol
---
just get killed by a bot.
---
Loll that would have been a good name
---
Lmaoooo ggg
---
nice
---
Actually it’s leon sharks and 8bits
---
Wow, this whole thread is just one big pity party.
---
They can’t. But it’s rare enough that it’s irrelevant a majority of the time. The problem is, doubled brawlers usually play many matches together because of the notoriety of the experience.
---
Wow every time I get a team with a frank he misses every super and just spends his time chasing a dynomike
---
Wow they were being dicks
---
Me gusta
---
You are correct, sir!
---
Dang is it really stolen?
---
Barley have 5 skins another one you serious
---
Gracias:)
---
Your welcome!
---
Bully? xD
---
Wait can you circle more things in red
---
Oml loll good idea
---
Hope it's a legendary
---
I would love to see this in game
---
Many thanks!
---
I got him from a box right before I hit 1000
---
Every day i play brwal stars i get either matched with the same teamate or they are my opponent. 
---
Not being figurative with "Every day".
---
What do u mean
---
As a person who knows a lot abput real life crows, i love this.
---
Damn, it!!! They should remove this. Maybe if the same brawler tries to play again they can't and they are exited out of the match.
---
Yes
---
*sniff* this is so sad
---
*F*
---
I bought el rudo. Too poor for el rey.
---
I dont have a mythic or legendary yet and I'm at +5k
---
Me for Leon: reach 4K to unlock
---
Imagine never getting any power points and instead having all level one brawlers cus you complain about getting power points...
---
Oh! My apologies, madam! 😅
---
...Then you aren’t really an OG player.
---
Hope u get a legendary soon :)
---
I want Frank but Leon in 1000 trophies lol
---
Snake Mortis
---
I got Crow and boosted him to rank 20 before the buff update when he was the worst brawler in the game. Was the hardest thing I've ever done in brawl stars. Took 8 hours.
---
Wait band aid but we were about to win RUNNING AWAY IN A PANICK (Man I love tf2)
---
Sounds good, but I have a lot of other submissions going on right now, so it’ll be a while beefier I can get on it. I’ll put you on my list!
---
Thank
---
Ah, you watch Havoc dont you? Heard his content is pretty 
---
#DANK
---
Yes. I had a thought on that too.
---
Yeet
---
Bro I like it good idea
---
I'm at 10000 trophies and have all the brawlers
---
comedy
---
You are a gamer
---
This is if Tick and Piper combined to form this
---
Haha noice
---
No 10k trophies
---
There are other beta brawlers without remodels, but Primo is the last OG brawler to get a remodel.
---
Man I got him near 1200 now I'm near 13k
---
Mortis has the best skin
---
On this big zoom how can you expect to read something this clearly?  
---
The other text is completely blurred; and in this blurred text you read something that's jet black..  
---
This is 100% edited.
---
Well I can't beat teamers becous  If I play "Solo" 9 Brawlers team each other. I won't team This is Solo Showdawn not Find a team and then backstab our Kill each other! Then everyone is vr me So I dont play Solo even for the Star token and yeah maby nobody Care and that's ok. 🙂
---
Happy cake day
---
You guys are getting legendaries?
---
Meaty lump that process food for newborn babies
---
Pls keep this at 69 upvotes
---
If you're, trying to push trophies, use the brawler you have the least amount of trophies with.
---
Also, If you see a Piper (Yellow haired woman with a blue or pink dress), try not to run. Instead, get as close as possible, if she doesn't already have her super.
---
How dare you disrespect Rico? I have Star power rank 1 Rico, and I have never lost a single Big Fight as the Big Brawler. I demolish the other players. I always at least get 3 minutes!
---
Right after i wasted my tickets
---
r/fuckyouinparticular

Can you link me one without the text?
---
where's spike
---
Surprise mf
---
Your a waste of time and elixir
---
Na. My religion is already the mortis religion
---
That subreddit is useless
---
I loved Poco’s 2nd model.
---
She wasn’t there when the game war first released which is what he means I think
---
First balanced and well thought out concept I’ve ever seen great work hope they consider this seriously
---
we can finally get more primo skins!
---
Works more like Oasis
---
This month is a MOON FESTIVAL, lunar new year is a chinese tradition
---
NANI?!

He is a beta tester of the raid
---
Ikr 😂
---
Awesome job
---
I can’t resist that “:3” face!😅
---
What would you like to request?
---
Thanks for clearing that up.
---
My reaction when the El Primo with 10 gems uses his super into instant death.
---
Epic
---
That comment felt like it belonged to r/youngpeopleyoutube one of those kids replying to themselves
---
I'm at 12 k and I get crow at 11.5k
---
Poco star power very weak. It is like Genes star power but poco is 30 healing per second and you need super. Make it 400 per second for healing.
---
Jealous about what? Lex is a self proclaimed average player. You playing a brawlers that you spam one button. 
---
The only thing interesting about this was that first goal by IX David. 
---
And YOU didn't beat Lex. Your TEAM beat the other team.
---
No. It was limited time. I don’t believe it ever said it was exclusive. And often times, limited time things come back.
---
Mortis is as good as the legendaries.
---
#k a w a i i   d e s u
---
I think he said that Pam isn’t a beta brawler because he thinks it “looks clean and modern” which isn’t the definition to classify what isn’t a beta brawler
---
That Shelly got some personal problem with Dynamike
---
Wait they changed it or you just edited it?
---
r/youngpeoplereddit
---
Ut?
---
Rip el primo
---
it's no-one. \*spelling error\*
---
Simple but quite an unbreakable spell
---
I took a lot of time to edit it together without it looking bad, supercell hasn't changed it.
---
True, hes one of my highest but like damn. I have to spend money to even get one. Smh.
---
Damn, looks really good man
---
Thanks :)
---
I actually don’t like him, I think is kind of boring to play with him , that why i preferred crow , but he is hidden in my boxes and leon no
---
I forgot this was a thing lol
---
Im big dumbass energy
---
Good teammates dont exist, even in area 51
---
And? Im new at the game I bearly have 3k
---
Bro that’s sad tho
---
Darryl tho
---
tribal brawler with baseball cap isnt related to a tribal bear shaman and a chameleon boy with a city hoodie, both of which ARE related
---
thomas has never seen such Bullshelly before.
---
Solution is to not care about trophies and just play for fun
---
Hello, I’m a beta tester of a new update in Bravl Stars. Can you give Leon a shark so that I can check how good it is, if it's not difficult for you.
---
El Rudo will be 30 or 80.
---
El Rey will be 80, 150 or 300.
---
See you in hot
---
I'm missing all 3 legendaries at 15.5k
---
So is this the reason why 3 colt and 2 piper teamming against me as a level 5 8-bit?
---
I mean if you want to do that you have to use mortis because only that way you can be the first one to reach the ball
---
Jessie, Darryl, Penny, Pam, Frank, and Crow.
---
I just dont like it because im burnt out by it. I want it to rotate with gem grab, have seige be its own crap mode, and bounty and heist together
---
Not a fan of brawl ball. Would rather have permanent Bounty.
---
Well boys. I did it. 10k trophies and not a single legendary in sight.
---
Yeah
---
I mean, how isn't anyone else noticing and not reporting this bug for us Bad-Wifi/Low-quality Phone users
---
Holy shit this is hilarious
---
El primo have a remodel?
---
It looks good
---
Hm. Frank did receive a minor tweak to his walking animation. I hope we'll see more for him.
---

I've been physically attacked.

Gdamn u put time into this
---
😳😳😳😳😳😳
---
ok, I will delete my post if it's bothering you
---
sorry to piss you off
---
Nice
---
I would hate to get those dirty
---
Well he doesn’t need one but it could certainly help a lot
---
I offer for 8000 or for 10000 cups to give one any legendary brawler, if all the legendary braelers are there, then give a few gems.
---
I have a el rudo primo
---
This is amazing
---
In my opinion, Ellie could be a cool name as well, Ellie being a shortened version of Electricity, alluding to her electric abilities and allowing her to fit in with the thematic, pun based names that most other brawlers have. Unless I missed a pun here.
---
Are you from hong kong?
---
I am boss of bosses
---
I do not know much English
---
Nice'nt
---
I ever since startin the game wanted spike but i aient complainin here
---
I think bull fits that buff school principal
---
Leon
---
Funny, laughed
---
Oh wow, I’m digging the New El Primo remodel.
---
Aww :&gt;
---
Maybe post it again but change the text to say: modifier?
---
It was I, 1 power up mortis
---
I wont leon remodel
---
Tara’s sibling?
---
i had to pay to get spike at 6k and my friend got leon around 1.7k

After this is another feeling of power post

Ok

Nice art

Does he though? He looks pretty modernized considering how brawlers look now. His skins are pretty good. (We don't talk about White Crow)
---
I got leon and spike same day

No pp?

It literally says legendary on the video

99/100 In boxes xD

Would smash 10/10
---
&gt; its the ost of a game called "haunt the house"
---
we will know if frank super hit you. this post is about "how did that hit me?"
---
Two seconds have passed
---
Oh, sorry i didin’t see that
---
Bibi x tara? Brawler has something like the ball on end of Bibi's bat
---
It's legendary sorry
---
I mean... that's one thicc ass.
---
Daddy no!
---
Shitty post
---
Easiest way to tell is look at the clan
---
im shocked that there is no Frank's super
---
no i dont think i will
---
Wow it looks really cool even for a wip i hope it gets finished
---
I don't know why everyone is insulting me, that's just for the meme. If you dont like it, put a downvote and go away.

Great ideas!! I like the first one the best but the second one is alright as well!

Your first power 9 brawler?

42069/10

Lol exactly what I was thinking looking at it
---
Leon was not in beta

I am not from america/england

Firts and second is amazing!

Robo mike but its normal

Idk I thought I saw this meme already before I might be wrong

I think crow,Frank and Pam will get new remodels.
---
I don't have any legendary and I'm at 13k so stop crying. But still good luck with the opening
---
Actually, you are immature 9 year old.
---
It’s rough, coarse, and gets everywhere.
---
Hahaha yass
---
But the idea is great!
---
He does not even shoot fire
---
He shoots it from his ding ding dong
---
Leon is the weakest legendary brawler right now

I forgot the barley skin sorry

If it is such an irrelevant idea then wtf did supercell add it ????
---
Supercell Response
---
Or let's say any other female brawler XD... Now that this guy pointed out; I can't help getting this thought out XD XD
---
It’s looks really cool but also really weird
---
Well last time we waited 3 days maybe again 3 days
---
I got everyone without donation
---
Yeah me too
---
quality content...
---
Oof. Deflected back to you ;)
---
Yeah, it's bit confusing though
---
You were talking about double trouble?
---
He shoots seamen
---
Tomorrow or the day after
---
Poco instead of Shelly
---
ok.
---
No
---
Yes, that is fricking annoying. I bought spike, but supercell didn't give me ANYTHING this summer.
---
U forgot the "above 10k"
---
It's over 9000
---
I prefer the current one
---
Yeah, I bought el rudo a couple of days ago, as I knew he was gonna get a remodel in the near future. Didn’t know it’d be this close though, jeez.
---
Yeah guess they should increase his invisibility duration or he should maintain his invisibility even after dealing damage and ends it only when the duration time runs out, just like rosa or carl
---
There’s literally nothing better about the old model
---
Flex tape will fix that!
---
Can't he(?) make an account after the drawing
---
because they can, this is a cosmetic change, they didn't have to add it but they did, so the change itself is irrelevant, it isn't going to change jessie at all.
---
Well I'm sorry I live in Ukraine with English is bad
---
&gt;!That's the joke!&lt;
---
I really want to play lone star!!
---
Me too!
---
Why the fuck would they buff 8 bit
---
Actually poco, if you listen closely in the brawl talk, you can hear poco guitar sounds when he attacks
---
Mate, they put this update together in a very short amount of time, give them a break.
---
Thx
---
Pam tho
---
How long did this take you also next time add a watermark so ppl don’t steal
---
Then don't whine about stuff 9 year olds whine about... Didn't mean to be rude
---
How will the new solo game modes affect the maps rotation ? Will they take a slot for solo showdown or will we have a rework ?
---
look im the guy in that post, i also found another person.
---
No one asked for this rushed update
---
Sorry
---
Welp,this post is about me!
---
Beautiful make primo next pls
---
F Primooooooooooo
---
Damn it I have 10k trophies eith no legendary
---
Piper eyebrows are still black😭😭😭😭😭
---
Muy bien, pero si tienes 1.000 copas con 5 Brawlers te quitan 2.500 copas, no se consiguen tan rápido!! Deberian bajar de copas al Brawler pero no al jugador, es mi opinión
---
Yeah. Mortis is so trash.
---
He put the sosige
---
Uohoho
---
I still need frank, crow and spike
---
IKE can see inside bushes so probably can see inside the sandstorm
---
Go to settings (In Brawl stars) tap “help and support”, and Then In the upper right corner there should be a button saying something like “contact us” or something
---
stfu
---
No buddy. Here’s the thing. These little things matter for Jessie fans so how about you stop criticising positive changes to the game eh
---
Imagine him shooting his "Sharks" at Piper ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Sandy already seems trash, though since my legendary odds are 0.2112%, i may get him out of blind luck
---
Anyway, good job by the Brawl Stars' staff for the update;one of the best in my opinion.
---
True
---
Pam was not in the initial release- instead, she was added alongside Tara about a few months after soft launch.
---
New legendary seems broken af, his range and at attack mechanics seems similar to tara's except better in every way.
---
3 potential invisible people seems also ridiculous, the area is pretty wide.
---
Not to mention the sp which is going to be super annoying, can't reallt dodge that.
---
just realized that Sandy sleep to close his eyes so he don't kill himself
---
Bruh moment #2
---
I love this comment &lt;3
---
Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.
---
he’s not trash??? 1v1’s just aren’t his strength
---
I bought it a few days ago before we had any clue about brawl talk. I have good foresight.
---
Well El Primo’s current model is ugly because it’s not well polished and many people are begging for a remodel for him. Turns out that supercell remodeled him and I prefer the remodel.
---
Ah you son of a gun. You said that the changes are irrelevant yet ur the one to ask for changes to them
---
The amount of low quality memes on this sub is horrendous
---
Yup. This guy seriously wants to claim a public idea that has been talked about for months as his own. He also didn't reply anymore lol
---
Shoot i r/wooshed myself
---
Can we just thank the devs for how hard-working they are
---
This is so cute! &gt;w&lt;

This is the worst way of stealing smh

not gonna lie the new model looks dope

oh no!

Why is there Rico two times?

She looks so pretty now!

Cool

..or any other...male br- 
---
ok ill leave
---
I’m at 8.5k trophies and I’m missing all 3 legendaries (will be 4 soon) 2 mythics and 1 epic
---
Yare? Consult a dictionary and get back to us. I’m the meantime it’s perfectly reasonable to think someone called Sandy is a female character. Just because he said ‘he’ in the video doesn’t mean he’s right, could have been a mistake.
---
In the next 3 days

Communist solves all problems

I have crow need gene and other legendarys

You are invisible in sandstorm. Making them blind isnt that useful

The new models look... Kiddy? Mainly primo's original model is super nostalgic for me, since he is my first rare...
---
Lucky i only have shelly at power 9
---
No sleep mechanic
---
49 big boxes.......
---
excellent now I'm never getting FOUR brawlers instead of three!!
---
what can we do to keep  the old model ???
---
It's a he, calm down, it's okay to be wrong sometimes, it's not okay to act like this.

I spiritually connected with you when the part that wasnt finished showed up
---
This has waaaaay too much effort for this sub
---
i dont even watch jojo but one look and u can tell its a ref XD
---
Can you translate to english pls??
---
How do you know this
---
am i a ghost?
---
I guess it could be changed to 4 characters...
---
Doesn't change a thing
---
me cuz i rushed
---
I know, its just to enjoy watching how they run No-Where. maybe There could be an utility in showdown w/ Meteor Rush
---
Nothing unfortunately... If you really wanna play primo's original model I suggest a brawl stars mod called lwarb beta. Likely they'll keep primo's original model
---
Good job Gene
---
epic bruh momebt, see you in hot
---
I have ent seen this
---
[**Original source**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jolly_Macaroon/comments/d4iv5l/edition_2202/)
---
well yeah
---
All of them
---
Maybe emotes but I don’t think actual chat would be very good. Too distracting and most of the time it might get ya killed.
---
His attack still shoots sand tho
---
but a mod is not like the game
---
nita
---
How the hell is this low quality! I love it!
---
NO HATS IN SCHOOL
---
I was so hyped because I thought that was what we were gonna get :( We definitely don’t need another legendary brawler. It’s only to satisfy those who actually spend money on the game.
---
Her eyebrows
---
XD
---
Ok thx for yur help :)
---
15 k
---
Almost better? Individual invisible ninja vs entire party of invisible ninjas. Individual loses invisibility upon first attack, entire party laughs uncontrollably in the background. With the announcement of Sandy’s super, Leon became obsolete overnight.
---
Whichever one you want, if you don't like them save up for one of the new ones
---
Trolled
---
Did you sneeze while recording this? I heard a sneeze
---
Amd I'm here at 5k f2p with 3 missing. Gene 8bit spike.  I feel bad for u
---
It's very complicated. Just think the higher number of boxes= the higher chance to pull a new brawler.
---
The look
---
Okie thx for yur help :)
---
Maybe not? but I need clarification
---
God Mode
---
You guys are the best! Thank you for this very good update in just 3 weeks!
---
I think they’ll be added in the showdown slot which would make sense. The new modes may also have duo modes which would make sense. They are on a showdown map...
---
650
---
Its a boi not girl
---
They'll probably change when it comes into play.  In Brawl Talk, Tick had the Spike Bomb.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Sorry for bad english
---
Dnas
---
good
---
Don't give up. Brawl stars is a great game but it takes a lot of practice to master it :)
---
Good bot
---
The Attack
---
Sandstorm is his super not his star power
---
i tought i was the only one ■¤■
---
Karma whoring at its finest
---
actually its not complicated, you can click the info button of the boxes on the shop, you dont have to have massive amounts of boxes to have a highet chance to unlock new brawlers
---
Ah yes enslaved sugar
---
I like both skin and i cant choose
---
What??
---
New sandy is support brawler bro
---
*throw a joke that inculdes piper's voice line here*
---
El milos?
---
When new brawlers first come out don’t they usually have them on special offer for less gems?
---
As soon as you attack the ike will attack you so I don't think it will be as op as it seems
---
Cute!!!!!
---
Dani confirmed it go watch kairos
---
No whoever does the most damage by the time the game is over wins
---
Well to my disappointment and yours, no. So I hoped this would be the case to everyone
---
Yeah, and the info button will tell you exactly what I said
---
Wow you play this game a lot.
---
I won a match with two afk randoms and i'm pretty proud
---
Well, my probability to find a legendary brawler are actually bigger than those for a mithic, so I will just hope
---
That's cool, but can we please get to the real issue? Nobody asked to have Brawlball locked in a permanent game mode. The rotation was fine IMO between all the maps the way it was before the last update. Now we have to wait three days to play siege, bounty, or heist. #BanBrawlball
---
Sorry I meant super
---
tara and gene:arhaggagrgggaggaaggugayg
---
New rico animation
---
You don't respawn, both new modes are actually showdown in disguise.
---
I know, thats why i said he is a boy
---
Damn bro
---
You see a timer going up so 3:25-3:26-3:27 etc
---
Supercell is doing their best to frequently update the game. after three weeks of amazing content they anounce gamemodes, skins and a lot more goodies to play around with soon
---
And you care about leon that he doesn't say two shit-words for you dumbass to hear? Im sorry but this is stupid
---
It's so beautiful
---
In between 349 - 700  gems
---
But at least we know he is related in some way or form
---
Nvm, I see what you mean. Still, 10 draws is a lot better than 3, which gives a higher chance to pull a brawler. Each induvidual chance has the same percent, but the higher number equals more draws
---
😂😂 U got me there!
---
Almost 12k and I’m missing Crow, Leon, and Pam. But I have Spike, so I’m not complainging
---
it doesnt, it just shows you percentage of dropping new cards, what you said was if you unlock 60 boxes back to back, you have a higher chance of unlocking 60 boxes not in a row
---
i drawed sandy but i cnt post it they say , unable to post photo idk why :((((
---
Watch it again, but this time actually pay attention.
---
The official name of Mexico is United Mexican States
---
Has*
---
I got leon when i have 900 trophies and nie i have 14000 trophies too
---
And a child
---
even though nobody who has brain cells will ever lose to an extra life 8bit
---
yes
---
New super for sandy: Can steal other peoples super and use it against them.
---
Mythic with mythic= 
---
#Legendary
---
#Excuse me, what the frick?
---
#POCKET SAND
---
Ok thank you!
---
It was already laughable the second star power he got basically a better way to run away from enemies I seriously don't understand why they're just shoving him into a trashcan they must have plans for a rework for him
---
Rico as new walking animation.
---
Funny, did laugh
---
So that means that sandy is transgender
---
I'm at 11k and I'm missing Crow, Leon, Mortis and soon Sandy
---
This is first model Poco!
---
Sandy is male
---
Wait a minute isnt Sandy a girl?
---
Says "only og" when it will be the most new change....... Ur not true og lmao
---
r/crappyoffbrand
---
Ps no offend looks so cute😀
---
Good shit man! I like the colorful and cheerful vibe
---
Now the piper and tara are going to extra hell with themselves getting humiliated online
---
15k in the trophy road still hasn’t been filled out, I think it should be a random free legendary brawler and then 15.5k gold,16k mega box,etc until to 30k which is another legendary(but no one is up to there yet)
---
That's the new projectile for dragon Knight Jessie, change my mind
---
Sandy?
---
Add sandy
---
r/sandygang
---
Ah I guess so sorry just every feature about that character and even the name just processed girl in my head is this considered a trap?
---
No? What about a Bull and a Rosa along with a Sandy?
---
The eye on the star
---
I wanted to say that
---
We are just ones among many :/
---
BrOcK GoT NeRfED
---
This is going to be the monkey haircut meme in brawl stars format
---
I wan this as a sticker
---
Uh, they are working on Club Wars. Frank already said that on Twitter.
---
Useless post right here.
---
Her gift, her curse 😞
---
Habalabrabaaaa

Brock: *hits El Primo*
---
Spetsnaz: interesting
---
STORY KODE COMFIRMED?
---
:(
---
He hit shelly
---
rub the lamp
---
He’s a guy
---
*he
---
Isnt that just the start of his flip
---
"Without auto aiming you may miss"  yeah it will happen if you kinda sucks at aiming, it's not like shotgunner where the best decision is spamming auto aim, the time between shots is enough time to pre aim, and it's not called "overthink" if you already get used to it.
---
Ffs
---
Perfection
---
okay and they’re numbers
---
Dude Primo just got a remodel for his base model and both of his skins, plus the new brawler Sandy+his skin. Cut Supercell some slack here
---
I did! And I'm at 10k now! :)
---
You're welcome!
---
People have their own opinions lol and plus at least I post things on r/Brawlstars you do nothing for the community except voting
---
Solution : Create a new account and play it to 2k  *modern problems requires modern solutions*
---
I don't like it.
---
I LOVE IT
---
I was at about 6.4k
---
It's the number of trophy
---
3 good 1 crow
---
OMG YOU WERE RIGHT, REPOST THIS DUDE
---
fuck no man everyone is happy with 8-bit and sandy, you’re just being an annoying fucking scumbag.
---
Free to play life, I have been playing for 2 years and only have spike, my friend just started and he got crow
---
But why does she still have black eyebrows when she is blonde and in-game she has blonde eyebrows instead?
---
But the legendary chance is highest at the start of a new account, you know.
---
Is actually the other way around way more 12k players have leggys compared to the few 2k that brag their lucky leggy, i reached 10k with no leggy but the chance keeps increasing and 3 months after i got to 10k i now have 2 leggys
---
this isn’t a bug it’s a friendly game
---
v:
---
They didn't fix her eyebrow though.
---
Wow...I never thought of tara as a sun she is more lunar-ish to me
---
Shes only want to sleep
---
dude, its the same as that picture, lmao do some post about this
---
AH OK BRO WTF LMAO
---
I dont think so.
---
Cuz when they're showing it in brawk talk there is the little exit button om the bottom of the screen. That means it has to be in a friendly match.
---
So eaither:
---
-they makeing ticketed events playable in friendly games
---
Or!
---
-its not a ticketed game mode
---
IK
---
yeah they were friends it’s not supercell’s fault
---
It is a bug in a friendly game.
---
Aaaaaaaaaaa no
---
Part 2
---
why lol
---
Gene FRICK his mother 
---
No, it is just being rude, this has happened to 2 other skins made by him +  a few others like mecha Crow or Outlaw Colt, sometimes, the devs are looking in the subreddit searching ideas that may actually be added in the game and they are not called facts without propper proof
---
It's just so wonderful!
---
Big thumbs up for you.
---
I want to see more:D
---
A bug is in a real game and don’t downvote me
---
So cool art work. Forgot Sandy though 😘
---
Yeah could be
---
why?
---
how do you make art so fast holy shit
---
The only way the Lone Star gamemode will get any better is unless this blares over in the background.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TDcHV5M8Qs
---
Yeah, they didn't fix the biggest problem about the previous icon.
---
She looks like human Spinel
---
I've got Leon and Spike. I've also been saving boxes for ages just for this moment. I'm gonna open them all when Sandy releases :)
---
It's gonna be so unfair if the exact same skins show up this year. I spent money just so I can get "limited" skins.
---
And that's not all yet, Youtubers and the devs team said there is more to come....
---
Swöre
---
She said " ^^:) "
---
bruh
---
I swear i'm f2p
---
Agree
---
Edit: I'm in love with her expression!
---
It isn't a big problem, but it's  problem.
---
He said Swööre
---
You forget another other lol
---
Anyways..IT’S FINISHED!!
---
Good job guys!!
---
Barley: 🤣
---
Yeah at like the end of trophy road that would be awesome
---
I think this skin would be perfect for Crow he's so colorless
---
It’s weird that they added that skin though, because it makes normal wizard Barley not so worth to get and draws people back from signing up to SuperCell ID
---
Maybe our 2nd skirmisher
---
1. Multiple people made shark leon skins not just tou so stop taking all the credit.
---
2. That spike skin is not even remotely close to the real one so dont try to get credit from it.
---
3. I already said my thoughts about the pirate skin on the other post you made
---
3 good 1 Sandy
---
you’re probably one of the people at 1k who got crow and leon in a span of 3 days
---
But i dont know why both side sometime still have lv1 player.(i usually play will ramdom)
---
Then why tf are you here? Just to hate on us and whine about how shitty this sub is?
---
sweet home halabama
---
Not a chance
---
Now i can’t unsee it oml, brock just “splashing”people.......
---
Because showdown is boring and adding them in the same slot would allow for some diversity. Also these are solo modes as well so they fit in that slot.
---
And what’s wrong with that...?
---
I think is cool and cute good one, I wosh I have one too
---
I'm 14k some rank 25 brawlers n I agree except for the making people under that trophy level look like noobs part
---
new supercell shop incoming?
---
Wow! I absolutely love it, great work once again man 💗
---
Yesterday i got leon and i was so happy i got all the brawlers and in the next day "new legendary brawler mother fucker"
---
Many people post about this for so long but it still not change.
---
I have Leon, but Spike and Crow are missing.
---
What about teaming?
---
hello i got 7k and only have crow cause i bought it, all my friends have mortis and i dont have him
---
As I mentioned in the video the stat sheet it a Photoshop done by me. It's actually Leon's stat sheet that I heavily changed.
---
oh no!  
---
  
---
yes yes yes yes yes
---
Thanks!
---
Link?
---
The problem is that now i need to wait to get the skin in the shop and idk if it comes before update
---
Thats pretty dope tho
---
Doesn't matter. Nobody agrees with him. Nice job getting a Medal!
---
hol up
---
I'm 10🏆 only missing leon and crow
---
o
---
Ikr xD
---
Believe me bro I know how you feel
---
(3k player)
---
LOLLL!!! GET IT BECAUSE PIPER HAS NO TEETH AND NOW THEY HAVE NO TEETH!?!?! HILARIOUS!!!
---
Boner eye
---
nope 0.000000001 sec after update
---
Rank 133769420
---
*He*
---
Nah, I mean default and core game modes since the very beginning. I don't think Brawl Ball will be permanent any longer once these two new game modes gets released
---
Oof sorry to hear that
---
Same whit robo spike.
---
Isn't sandy a Girl name? There's Sandy in Spongebob and she is a girl..
---
Well shit siege is dead
---
r/eyebleach
---
Supercell is definitely listening to the community considering the fact that the two new game modes are based off of ideas suggested by redditors which got pretty popular
---
The remodel is sick
---
Wow
---
Just look up “ahaha guy” and you’ll see him lol
---
r/imsorrycolt
---
Last update was was not very long ago so I’d assume this update would be a week to keep consistency between brawlers, but they most usually would release 1-3 days after the talk
---
İ hate teamers
---
Is that your channel?
---
Yes, but in Brawl Talk they said it's "he" and I think they named him Sandy because of he shoots sand and can make a (darude) sandstorm
---
A cool idea would add something similar to tournaments in clash royale and win skins or new brawlers!
---
What are the odds of getting her from 2 brawl boxes?
---
Why would you do this to yourself
---
Him, and very slim
---
Same fam, only brawlers I don’t have yet
---
Nice idea for next year
---
He's a bull fighter
---
Yes!
---
Oh ok sorry😅
---
Im f2p and somehow have every brawler in the game (it's still going to be a pain to get this one)
---
Oof
---
If u read my other comment maybe u are something
---
One of my friends that I talked about got it before me and he was playing for less time FeelsBadMan
---
adorable
---
Sandy is Tara
---
When does this come out?
---
Sandy is a girl...
---
That's a bouncy boi
---
THE POOOOR BOY NEEDS HIS HAT TOO ITS AS MUCH AS A PART OF HIM AS HIS TATOO
---
rip shark leon for not throwing star fish
---
Definitely still funny how dumb those bulls and darryls are though
---
This is straight out of porn. There is no deny
---
Just make her shot an electric arrow
---
3000 IQ
---
snaS
---
It wasn’t intended as a skill play, but the way all the darryls and bulls came towards me was insane
---
Why do you want it?
---
I team against Shellys and other annoying brawlers but if my "teammate" attacks (for example) a Mortis, I backstab
---
Sandy is tara
---
Because she is cute and everyone thinks she is a girl
---
Poor developers
---
For sure
---
r/shittybrawlstars
---
So FUNNY... Stop, get some help. This joke is overrated and not funny and guess what my guy that's 169 not 69 because you have one box that takes 100 tokens so that's 100 tokens +69 tokens.
---
Poor calculation method: mythic + mythic +2 (total percentage) + 6*3+2 (52,087.961)(0.2087961)(1.5)= legendary + the freaking legendary chance.
---
the meme made me curious
---
He has obtained dominance.
---
Hehe true
---
Chill dude
---
Take me as an apology for us 12 year olders
---
°u°
---
Rank WAM BAM HERE COMES PAM *
---
Don't give me hope!
---
Thats pretty much what they did with Rosa. She got nerfed like 6+ times in seperate categories.
---
8-Bit is ridiculous, pretty much a better Ricochet in every way. His only real counter are throwers because of his slow speed.
---
I need it !
---
Looks good:D
---
Ok. But this post it's a shitpost
---
Are you kidding?  It somehow looks even LESS polished than current.  His mask/face looks like a fucking joke now in the new skin.  As far as I'm concerned they RUINED El Rey.
---
U want to aim them kinda w the corner of ur shot, not the middle, the corner has a larger radius
---
Very nice update imo
---
Ha! I have 1 box!
---
Idk y peiple r upvoting but it's the same meme released when 8bit came just here sandy is added
---
😂 your mad at a guy whit 1000 trophies?
---
dude don't misunderstand my idea
---
I know. But you don't always get 69 tokens do you?
---
Oh wait the sun is a star
---
Not everyone has an eye/eyes that can punch through a cardboard box. Pretty special to me.
---
I don’t like playing games just to play them, I like having something to work towards while playing them.
---
I can't believe how disappointed I am with the Primo remodel.  I've stayed positive with just about every single remodel so far, but the detail somehow looks WORSE on the new model.
---
...why u mean. I literally said I agree with u on the basis of what u said about 10k being high. The only thing I disagreed with u is that maybe that wasn't his intention then u misunderstood me n grouped me up with those narcissistic people. To clarify I said "mean" meaning jerk not "mean" as in definition n also to clarify that part was a joke so I don't intentionally mean to call u mean
---
Heck yeah!
---
thats nice
---
better a flameball. they didn't even have electricity in middle age
---
I forgot he has the same damage as you Mortis.
---
*Interesting*.
---
Got Tara last week, so this is me now...
---
*laughs in Beach Brock*
---
Sandy looks like a Smash Land character, thats instantly what I thought of when I saw him.
---
Oh, I can hear three screams of agony already
---
Well no but joke died
---
God i really don't want this to be canon
---
Can I use this as the sub icon for r/SandyGang?
---
Amazing tecnic and idea
---
I'm so sorry Mexican Sans. 
---
Just help explain whatever the he'll is going on with this *Sandy* person.
---
*oh okay*
---
Lol I’m an idiot random and I still win apparently
---
Oh DAMN GIVE ME YT CHANNEL LINK
---
Just like robo spike
---
carlculating
---
Lol, he was and I was playing at 500 trophies...
---
10000000000000000069$?
---
Fun fact, most of Brawl Stars playerbasr is male, so it makes sense that they market towards their biggest audience 🤷‍♂️
---
Cool! Where is his gun though?
---
See. I know it's a shit joke but still. It thought it was kinda funny to post it
---
Poco OP
---
Tara looks like genes and sandys mom tbh dunno whos the father tho, *maybeeeee mortis* but thats a stretch
---
Cries in Italian

Well one thing I know it ain’t Poco’s offspring

I don't like the Primo remodel

Wait why?

I’m sorry that you have to go through this everyday, Dani. Some ungrateful community complaining about everything. When will it end
---
It was too hard to make because it needs hard work to make it look like a normal 3d 8bit gun
---
haha shark brok sperm funni
---
remodel doesnt mean good.
---
Idk i just saw it
---
i tought i was the only one. it triggers my ocd.
---
I think gems is a better route that supercell would take. And I say around 10,000 trophies there should always be at least one brawler in the shop.
---
He, gene and tara have similar clothes, supers that can rotate a game on its head and thats pretty much it
---
I have only spike but lucky, I opened up one brawl box when I was 12k, I have 237 brawl box now
---
Thats terrifying
---
I actually have leon and the only thing ive spent on the game was a mortis offer
---
Almost same with the mythic brawlers
---
Thanks
---
Maybe change the Discussion flair to the News flair
---
amazing keep it up
---
Rank *100*
---
Damn chill tf out let him post if he wants to... even if it is a dead meme... just let him

and if frank have super...

What is the point of being far then?

They got shaking as well, rip meme
---
me in the corner with 13k and still no mythic or legendary
---
r/engrish
---
i like it
---
I hope brawl stars fix their legendary drop rate system
---
I hate Siege because its honestly impossible to play it with randoms. Even worse than Gem Grab.
---
You are the beest!
---
Elsö
---
both are yummy
---
Thanks dude!
---
Hello
---
Bye
---
Thank you!
---
same
---
Thx!
---
My bad
---
Np so cool animation!
---
very goog
---
The brawlers that haven't been remodeled are Pam, Leon, Crow, Carl, Penny, Rosa, Bibi, Frank, Gene, Tick, and 8-bit.
---
8-Bit and Tick don't really count, since they haven't been out that long
---
It's to balance the sp. Make Piper good when she is far, but not op and make her deal a bit more dmg at close range
---
Tbh, BRAWL BALL is the mode that requires MOST communication and therefore worst to with random
---
But I understand. It is team dependant
---
but primo is just getting a remodel
---
I envy. The legendaries are sooooo OP. I want to be OP as well 😆
---
Now zhe dont look like a creep
---
Just helping out, not ridiculing your speech, but it should be “ I Felt embarrassed when I won this, and I hope supercell improves match making quality.”

God damn the suspense

Removed. Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. Additionally do not use low effort/all caps/clickbait titles.
---
Thanks and I agree... it would be
---
sandy's ability to sleep while walking is epic
---
When sandy will be added you will have to update it but either way Incredible Job
---
She's got a long range but can barely hit anything  at more than half her range. In a 1v1 situation chip damage dies not help that much
---
This made my day!
---
The new brawltalk should be on the front page right now if this sub. New legendary brawler called Sandy is going to come out and some other stuff.
---
Well. She is using a crossbow. I said that aesthetic wise . You have a point tho
---
Agreed. I still am missing spike. Played since beta. Token doublers constantly active. It’s crazy!
---
Ryan: (reads this) who is ryan

The Sun is a Star, but a Star is not a Sun

I'm doubting about it a lot 🤦‍♂️

Brock shoots at Jessie from behind. Imagine the super

I actually really like that 😂♥️

I was asking for a link to the original meme

Supercell needs to sell that! If they end up selling I'll take 10!

Wrong order

draw zelda and send to here and see tue ge goet dmca'd(lol jk)

Sorry my english is very basic, and some times i use google translator for write, my original idiom is spanish.
---
 Supercell said that the Christmas skins will return every Christmas
---
Ok cool. You should post this to r/MortisGang
---
I wasn't expecting this. The 8-BIT Brawl Talk felt like yesterday.
---
it gives a more complete picture of all the Brawlers.
---
Nice work man!
---
where did he say it was a girl?
---
So brawl ball??
---
Thanks. My chance is 0.192 so hopefully these boxes and the 130 normal I have is enough 😅
---
[deleted]
---
Yeah hes pretty shitty as a legendary brawler tbh
---
i dont think so
---
she's naruto running
---
Sorry, bitch I'll do better next time.
---
Sometimes it will change and sometimes it wont change
---
Well done!
---
Gold
---
I think you're over playing this shit dude...
---
“I Am sO sMArT”. Can you please stop now there is no particular pattern or whatnot they just decided to add a legendary.
---
Do you think every brawler from now on Will Release with a skin and second star power?

Congratulations
---
Any idea by how much the chance increases?
---
best
---
Does the game files let you know when the packs come out? Cause I’m eagerly waiting for the big value pack haha
---
すごい！
---
Something alike, but u can’t shoot the ball
---
I know but dudes can have long hair.
---
how do you shoot an energy orb out of a crossbow
---
IQ 10
---

---

---
Bow down to me I have 0
---
Just use your *Imagination*
---
Dans
---
It didn't or should I say, I didnt see and I am waiting too but there is still maybe, maybe I am really that dumb to see that wrong, you know
---
Yeah I seen that bug
---
Guys im shaking...
---
Say whaaat
---
Ikr so dumb
---
you must be so excited that you make 2 posts about it. oh, and pirate gene was made like 300 times so it isn't yours.
---
With Leon it seems his special never helps me in any way I have yet to sneak up on someone and spam auto shoot till death upon the enemy as had happened to me numerous times.
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
Alright then.
---
That was fast comment
---
Yeah, saw another one just after too. Originality wasn't really there this time
---
its a visual bug
---
What about Sandy?
---
EPIC! :O #csuszyop
---
how could you let this happen, Mortis?
---
ah yes, saying facts makes you a dick.
---
Nagyon jó az Animáció!
---
Lol 😂.. I'm famous 😂😂
---
But my got 11 upvotes
---
YouTube subtitles don’t always sync properly.
---
Lol this awesome. Here's an upvote.
---
He isn’t even released yet I don’t know the full stats
---
Nope cuz legendary
---
I think she’s going to be quite good - especially with her super.
---
So good i wish to see mote :)
---
Lol roller derby nice win right there 👌
---
Thanks for your support!
---
Did you win?
---
No it's not the facts it's just this poster if have a good time posting this and comments like that are just rude
---
Only KairosTime doesnt have the word - Brawl Stars in his name
---
月饼!
---
Ez nagyon jó!
---
How much trophies? I'm 10.5k needing Crow &amp; Leon
---
Oh ok
---
What? how?
---
YOU TAKE THE MOON AND YOU TAKE THE SUN
---
This looks sick, well done!
---
No🤣😂
---
Yeah but where's Sandy Cheeks?
---
Sweet I’m the 1% free to play
---
Honestly same. But my friends do get star powers, so there is a chance still.
---
He is saying that the original idea is from op and supercell took the basic idea/inspiration from his art
---
Oh shoot, I realized that just now, hold up
---
Please leave Pam alone
---
now shes gonna grind hard :/
---
Still better than facing several Dynamikes.
---
Sandy is a boy
---
Yep I watch new instead of hot
---
And el rey is still just meh( in my opinion rudo is way better)
---
That guy just posts so many skins and well pirate skin is simple to think of and see that the skin is totally different from his version anything which looks a biy like your is not just taken from your idea
---
Guys I'm shaking...
---
We don’t do that here......ok?
---
yeah...
---
Cold rico is cold
---
Lol thats true
---
Yesssss
---
They both associate with sleep so....
---
What do you mean? He wanted you to win
---
It look like a snek
---
Bruh, Sandy releases with a new skin and no skin for Pam
---
When is the update coming out? I was thinking like Wednesday or Friday, somewhere between there.
---
Wouldn’t of happened if the leon on your team hit his shots
---
haha Gene
---
Almost thought the video was in black and white before I saw the red thing—
---
Not really you get to unlock a legendary at 2k trophies if u are lucky
---
Well boo hoo let me play a sad song for you on the world's smallest violin
---
That’s amazing
---
No, he used to be a really easy brawler to get. I pulled him out of a box.
---
It's your opinion
---
I mean... he attacked me in the start of the clip, continued to attack me, he healed himself and attacked again.... I get a feeling it as BM not friendly.
---
That guy knows the truth
---
Honestly I like your version much more! Especially since his lamp is replaced by a hook. Congrats on getting it into the game.
---
Combining two of my favourite things into one meme. Wish I can upvote more han once.
---
Maybe an energy orb shaped like an arrow?
---
Yeah, that's what he was trying to say
---
or you are lucky and have all three for free like me
---
Gender doesn't matter, but ok?
---
Vital
---
Thank you and sorry about that. Im still learning english.
---
Truedat
---
That's very possible, another solution I think they might have is changing the rotation system for the gamemodes (similar to how the made bounty, heist, and seige rotate in a single slot).
---
They hated Jesus cause he told them the truth
---
Wait, did they specify if they were entirely new gamemodes or just ticketed events
---
W T F Mr Bat...
---
You succeded, Comrade
---
This should be a event type of skin that comes out in Career Day!
---
Some of us couldn't play before global release due to location or devices
---
I thought of that today but i was tired, you got first
---
You've never played tuber simulator ?
---
You're welcome
---
Story of my life(not a joke)
---
I have all 3 lol
---
I mean, I tried posting this on the pewdiepie submissions reddit, no one looked at it, oh I also made that photo.
---
No.it should be an arrow its a crossbow not a flamthrower
---
“Rocket RAAAVVVVEEEE”
---
How about lightning spells?
---
The bottle fires lightning twice, once on landing and a second one for the second tick of damage.
---
..unbealivable talent
---
The first attack was when there was three brawlers left. He wanted second place. When the other guy died he thanked you and spun. He never healed and didn’t start attacking until you ungratefully attacked him right away. He could have won, but he didn’t need to win so he gave it to you but instead of thanking him you ruthlessly attacked him. I know it’s sd but still
---
wow I wander how tock looks as well
---
Ngl the new portrait is worse
---
I even called it. I said to my brother who was watching me "watch how this Mortis dies now and throws the game"
---
That you can do to all brawlers
---
Wanna recipe? Take Leon mix with Poco and add some Sandy's  character and you'll get Sans.
---
its not my opinion
---
a nice is supposed to be 420 and 69
---
I got piper on 7.5k
---
It's most likely that both new gamemodes won't be ticketed events, although takedown has a higher chance of being a ticketed event.
---
Don’t worry there’s only like three posts and their all shit
---
Nah, I like the current one. Even the 0.5 like before is even better. But 0.4 is okay.
---
Link??
---
9 months later...
---
Everyone is Lol
---
Watch again, he attacks first.
---
is gene a girl? look at his skull it looks like whatever you call those headbands
---
#AROUSAL
---
I tried to play Shelly and I kept on getting the boss  I got really tired and left it at that
---
Whats ur legendary chance
---
I dont hear no voicelines for barrels so shutup
---
Edit: thats a joke btw dont get offended (ive been meaning to change my flair to Penny bc im a penny main tbh. I dont like crow)
---
I hope he realizes that this is also a meme about the brawl talk
---
People don't seem to respect 8-bit's raw damage output, never mind with the damage totem.  And up close, the auto-aim seals in the flavour.
---
Never said it was a special play.
---
That penny was hiding in the bushes next to a wall, and she thought it wasn't possible to see inside  a bush through walls, that's why she didn't react when I was approaching her as Mortis.
---
My guess is theyre gonna take up an entirely new slot, or like bounty heist and siege they will rotate between showdown lone star and takesdown
---
Lol
---
The 2 new modes might be in the same slot as showdown since they take place in showdown maps.
---
Nice!
---
I'm out for an hour and then boom 1k upvotes, thanks btw
---
who's is this sleepy, lost child?
---
Well no one likes Pam soo
---
the reasons:
---
1. Shelly's  original facial features are beautiful actually
---
2. Colt is always says TOO PRETTY TO PAIN, now it comes true :D
---
Yeah i'm going to remake it sometime
---
#NOOOOOO
---
Thats adorable
---
Me has respondido lo mismo en los dos comentarios hablando de las cejas de Piper jaja
---
There's no official news of what will happen to the slots, either they rotate the modes in a single slot or the add more slots. It may even be possible that sc will change the event list entirely.
---
I can Denny whatever I want. Your idea was far from original.
---
Oh my god dafaq
---
Lol mine is 0.2064
---
“Despite the creators officially stating the facts, I will deny them and make my own headcanon!”
---
Flaming arrow
---
Star Shelly
---
&gt;!like this?!&lt;
---
Yes this is ugly. Dont say its ugly just to get good responses. And again... its f*cking ugly
---
...
---
Got my first legendary at like 3k maybe
---
I hope they make brawl ball alternative and not a permanent in the third slot. I really hate waiting just to play heist as it is one of my favourite modes.
---
Sweet idea
---
Y no me downvotees hombre, que te he hecho yo para que me odies así :(
---
Penny be like: ᶦ'ᵐ ᵒᵏ
---
Yes.
---
Why the hell are you speaking Spanish?
---
Sandy: Am I a joke to you? (Good art!)
---
Thank you, but it is not that good
---
Lol me too
---
I still need Crow.
---
Thank you :)
---
I have played this game since portrait and still have no legendary (havent spent a dollar on this game)
---
There were some complaints about seige, bounty and heist rotating in a single slot, but not that many people were annoyed with the change, so it's about %50 both ways.
---
Eu ainda não acredito que tu é br
---
Dude, it's too easy reach 400 trophies now...

# POCKET SAND
---
"wheres the love for mama j?"
---
"wheres the love for our chameleon boi?"
---
how about wheres the love for our freaking devs?
---
I'm part of the 1% that has never bought anything and has all the legendaries
---
Its actually good not like the others
---
Look at that face, so lady like. Sandy should've been a girl
---
Easter egg supercell add in the game it was the old power cubes, it can be seen when bo mines are places or piper super for a very short time
---
How about tara
---
All your skins, you made so many skins and its just 3 and also many ppl made shark leon before you did, the mecha spike is nowhere near the real same with gene. just cause something looks very little similar to your idea its doesn't mean its been taken from you.
---
It’s good to know that at least SC listens, even tho I thought this was something stupid to complain about, but I’ve seen them implement a few ideas from this sub reddit, so that’s pretty cool.
---
You’re right, it looks more like a repost to me
---
Oh nevermind, you’re just a douche who’s trying to karma farm based on your account lifespan
---
Beautiful.
---
I feel so lucky, at 10k 100% f2p and i have all brawlers
---
Only cause there were 4 of them
---
Seige was broken when 8-bit's second star power was added, which is part of why I stopped playing it
---
He baby
---
İ think that with this animation there can be the mega knigt el primo skin
---
What disgusts me more is how Tara and Gene created Sandy...
---
I mean Tara could use her shadow clone along with Gene's magical puffs....
---
Yeah no
---
I am at 6.5k, didn't even unlock Piper yet!
---
Ah que eres catalán, podemos hablar en catalán entonces.
---
No em donis vot negatiu, Què t'he fet jo perquè em odiïs així?
---
No it wasn't
---
i know!
---
but i don't think penny dye her hair only when she's at her home
---
Probably they released brawl talk while he/she was at school
---
It is a bug. It just happens when I open The game
---
She looks very pretty
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Spellcheck your memes
---
L cus I hate Leon.
---
Lmao ms paint
---
No way 😲
---
She's not that good in a 1v1 interaction
---
Cold Colt is Gold
---
if they charge to you at the same time may able to take you down lmao
---
not me lol
---
She should get a repost?
---
Holy jesus
---
So you actually aren't spanish? Why do you have a spanish name then?
---
Piper skin is cute
---
i dont have anything better &gt;:(
---
Can his daggers be a different color every time
---
You literally just put a filter on it.even a recolor is better
---
omg Dynamon that is what i was thinking *Highfive*.
---
Why 19 september sandy comes earlier
---
Yes that's what I meant I just get confused because he looks like a she
---
also wanted to point out that Sandy and Luna are both supports( in the game under sandy’s name it says support)
---
This sub is full of entitled brats who think everything should be handed to them on a silver platter
---
Doubt they’ll listen
---
Nice job stealing people's content
---
Why I have the feeling that Piper is much more cuter?
---
I dont get it, it's just knight brawl
---
Tara meanwhile: If I can't win Uno, I'll win WITH Uno.
---
Funny, im almost at all brawlers lvl 9 unlocked and still missing leon and spike. Looking forward to missing another one :)
---
Imo Pam doesn't need a remodel, but please give her a damn skin already
---
f
---
brawl ball is more heart than skill
---
I think the same, I myself chose to buy the el rudo skin over the rey a while back (but not gonna lie rey's cape looked pretty good, don't like the new one though)!!
---
I don't think this is flying fantasies
---
New game modes will be ticketed events???
---
I love this!!
---
Lol idiot.
---
Or Sanco
---
Thx dude
---
Lmao Leon with two tails
---
Well hey since 8 bit and sandy got a skin before release, the guys i can explain meme doesnt matter anymore
---
THATS ENOUGHT
---
Wth
---
he is weak because
---
he is a support, here goes your whole nonsense theory, i am not even going to talk about the "looking like a mythic" leon looks like a rare, piper looks like trophy road and pam looks mythic along with frank
---
Shut up. It doesnt fit him. It fits brock much more. I cant believe that all of you leon fanboys got a skin that you wanted, but still complain. My god...
---
P.s low quality meme so r/shittybrawlstars, kid.
---
Idc about sandy for now
---
It looks fine without teeth. I think it will be much worse if sandy does have teeth
---
It would be cool if his daggers had those peacock eyes on the feathers behind him
---
There is no Easter Bunny, there is no Tooth Fairy, and there is no new brawler named Sandy!
---
Sandy you will get in 2022 now 😂
---
In a game i used nita and i defeated 5 shelly
---
It definitely is, all the obstacles, jumppads, and bushes are in the same exact spots
---
Only difference is that the bushes are yellow instead of green
---
Its only a problem in Siege. Like you get the El Primos who jump in their spawn with 10 gems *sometimes* in Gem Grab but in Siege I consistently have people running around watching the other team take all the bolts.
---
Loved all of em
---
Lmao the enemy team’s Mortis dun goofed
---
Fact ☝️ They need to cut to the chase
---
Ah maybe now that I think about it
---
Can’t do anything about it unfortunately unless you have recording, then maybe.
---
Schrodinger's cat
---
this was stolen **twice** by you . . .  Realy?
---
Not funny didn't laugh.
---
Damn that was nice
---
:0
---
Nita Sandy
---
Shelly mains suuuuuuck
---
Lol idiot
---
Hera approves
---
Dirt in the eye hurts s lot more than getting shot in the head, stabbed and getting your ears exploded.
---
Most likely
---
In Lone Star especially, I imagine a bunch of people will be camping in a corner feeding each other kills
---
Satisfying too lol
---
Awesome concept, how do you do it?
---
It all comes down to opinion really, but before sandy people thought "mortis + tara = gene" but now with sandy people switched to "gene + tara = sandy" and thats just because of looks, im personally for the mortis and tara one because we're excluding mortis whos a mythic brawler and should count as a part of the mythic family but then again supercell doesn't give a damn about lore
---
k ima post a video
---
Thats what i thought and thats what my friend but i got .1488 chance an no legendary from any box or even mega
---
they surely will, even old rudo primo looks so unique and definetely costs more than 30
---
Cries in Derryl
---
only true Og's will know what this is referencing
---
I know I can’t believe he actually missed it, it just made us win by attacking them after and scoring 😂
---
Weren't people saying that mortis and tara are genes parents
---
It's the oposite for me.
---
Nice work m8! Keep up the good work!
---
Because of his attack. Its similar to pocos
---
Wtf why does the sandstorm turn allies invisible
---
Man, it took like 2 hours of work. U have no idea
---
I want one mortis of all because all my friends have mythics
---
Nope.
---
I have the proof ;) go to my profile and scroll all the way till you find my post about "my first legendary"
---
Lol yeah this dude is a little delusional....
---
Oof gg for patience
---
Not funny, didn't laugh.
---
I mean theets are kind of hidden when you yawn, maybe I am wrong idk
---
Neither dead nor alive until the box is opened 
---
Why isn't there a schrodingers dog?
---
"I reject your reality and substitute my own."
---
Gratz your on getting onto emkay video
---
Crow's too weak, Spike's too weak, and now u think a 5600 health brawler is too weak? Wtf r u on?
---
Ok I respect you
---
Sorry Lazuli177 for copying your arts!
---
Koisu, please don't do this to Sandy
---
No i miss bibi piper leon spike crow tara f for  me
---
Yes I always do that, very useful when you 1vs1 another Frank
---
If rarity had NOTHING to do with strength, you're saying Dynamike is equal to Crow. That's not true, obviously. The rarity defines the brawlers characteristics which also define their strengths and abilities. There is such thing as a skill gap. Just because a random gets Crow, that doesn't mean they will mow over everyone else. They have to be good with him first.
---
Thank u! It was painstaking
---
I mean, it is a crossbow, but she is already shooting a lightning orb from the damn crossbow. So basically anything is a go.
---
Don't wake the Sandy
---
I'm proving my point, so people like you won't say if I didn't "well why is he weak huh? why didn't you explain that?"
---
**g l o b e   b a l l**
---
But Gene star power is the same of poco...
---
No u
---
I’m at 8.4k and I’ve somehow been lucky enough to get all the brawlers. I started at global.
---
Not really :/
---
They literally revealed all stats about him in Brawl Talk alone. There is literally nothing hidden anymore about Sandy EXCEPT his second star power.
---
Speech 100
---
I mean im gonna be honest...thats not a funny joke (I didnt get offended, im just saying its not funny)
---
There will be teams in these two new modes, what I don't know is how common the teams will be
---
You’re welcome
---
Wood Fired Pizza?
---
None of ur skins look like the ones ingame
---
Ok...
---
Check brawl talk goddamn
---
I got 3 one day ago
---
What description am i not seeing something
---
In that case we also need an Ostrich Sandy skin. since, y'know, they stick their heads in the sand..
---
..ok, I'll remove myself now
---
okay so is gene and tara now sandy's parents
---
No it's clearly Dani
---
Hahaha
---
Hahahaha
---
Ahahaha
---
Please Supercell, confirm this.
---
Thats how this sub works bro
---
thats the point
---
cuz then u can pass over the water (i think) and people like darryl or bull can cross still
---
El darryl
---
Yeep
---
Congrats, I hope you get credited for the idea
---
his eyes are creepy af imo.
---
I find it weird how y'all think it's a girl or a boy it's a video game character in my head
---
My baby brother can
---
Don't be silly, Supercell can't possibly fix you.
---
Next frank pls
---
they donated their teeth to piper
---
Jesus, how much do you play
---
There is!
---
Yeah this is very confusing
---
DO YOU EVEN REALIZE HOW MUCH A THIEF YOU ARE?!
---
LMAO    LOL ！
---
Looks nice!
---
This is stolen. Not a single person ever noticed.
---
on a banana skin?
---
**Are you sure about that?**
---
Thank you!💜
---
Her icon is much beautiful now
---
Accurate
---
Good, 18?! I thought you were 50, you are soooo boring 🤣 ok as you are young, you have a future,go to the NASA and advice them to give a better animation to their rockets 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍
---
Brawlers?
---
Do we have a release date?
---
Sandy is good enough to be a legendary if he has a super where an area gets you invisable just like leon super just for himself
---
They are legendary brawlers for a reason. Also, this idea is pretty much just the old system of chips back in 2017.
---
Haha I won I have three and my computers broken so i don't have touch screen so i can't play the new gamemodes ha PS i'm dying inside
---
That's... That's the point
---
Made* not maded.
---
[I mean....](https://tenor.com/view/alittle-confused-hes-got-the-spirit-fresh-prince-gif-10576575)
---
Seems like the hair was from both. Tara has light purple hair and Gene has dark purple (the pointy beard thingy) and combined they make that purple
---
I noticed that too !
---
Delete this cursed post
---
She looks kinda hot tbh
---
Invisiheal for Leon sucks but would be broken for sandy
---
Go watch new brawl talk .
---
sandy: **snoring**
---
Yeab but they are related
---
You have become the very own thing you swore to destroy
---
thaaaat's right :D
---
He looking kinda sexy tbh
---
Self promotion
---
Yea, I feel like his main attack should already slow down brawlers, just by a little though.
---
Give credit to the original creator.
---
Thought it was carl
---
Your enemy finally becomes your allie
---
Who?
---
This is already stolen.
---
This just makes Mortis a forgotten mythic. Like, he already doesnt fit.
---
Since bibi
---
Laziness
---
Wow... Where are you from
---
El rudo primo looks hot not gonna lie
---
My newborn fetus is a veteran
---
I kinda hope so but I bet the game mode with the robot (forgot what it’s called) is going to be a ticketed event
---
BECAUSE THIS IS GOOD AS STOLEN! I NEVER REALIZED TILL I CONTACTED THE ORIGINAL CREATOR.
---
Really??? Well then I'll take your word for it, thanks for informing me. 😅👍
---
When it will update?
---
Why did dynamike make them
---
I was right
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/bk4hj7/i\_recreated\_the\_expanding\_brain\_meme\_use\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/bk4hj7/i_recreated_the_expanding_brain_meme_use_it/)
---
Yup, me too
---
It's a heart symbol, so it will be some sort of healing. Probably similar to Pam's turret.
---
I wish this was El Primo's actual remodel actually
---
Good but Frank's star Power is pratically extra Life nerfed and tara's Is like Rolling reload
---
A bot got 1st place ʼ-ʼ
---
r/antidariusbrawlstars
---
So sand does more damage then a flying pickaxe ok that makes sense
---
Lmao I'm getting negative karma
---
Pam is fine, she just need a skin
---
No cause I got crow with that
---
Better then if I were to make one mine would be horrible
---
Nah I critised his other skins. I'm not redoing the gene thing twice
---
Leon look the coolest.
---
Now, instead of knocking them back they just get a really hard slap to the face that hurts and the pain stays there for a while.
---
ok but can u touch ur tongue to ur nose? huh? didn't think so
---
BRAWL PASS FORESHADOWING INTENSFIES

No they change based on the team the opposing team will be red and yours blue

Me TOO!

Guys guys...

8Bit, Frank, and Sandy.

The Ike is literally dead with 1 push

I'm excited for Carl's new replaced star power
---
Brawl universe
---
It's so fucking easy to get karma on this sub.
---
Just steal anyone's art and that's it.
---
Who let you into reddit?
---
Mine just came up from 0.08 to 0.096 so idk man... no legendaries + no tara
---
yeah, if/when it gets like that, everyone will quit and move to rush wars, like cr to bs
---
They're not since the first day
---
I haven’t been on Reddit in a while, is r/whoosh still an acceptable term?
---
Crow was holding the peacock miraculous and his name is croyura
---
The point of fan art concept skins is so that hopefully they can have it added into the game, idk why you think they “copied” or are upset about this. They took inspiration from your fan art and you are upset by this? I don’t think you are the type of person to deserve it into the game like this then.
---
My invisibility
---
Ya and it’s more expensive too
---
If some chick has hairy, bushy grandpa eyebrows then you could say she looks like a grandpa

Fire arrow

If this is not funny/humorous, please reply on how I can improve (I'm not really good at memes....)

Looks like a washing machine
---
Piper plus crow be like
---
Ok ik already
---
No, legendary.
---
Thats crazy .. mayb its all not random after all
