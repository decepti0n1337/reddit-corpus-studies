Where is it said that She is indeed a child?

Maybe you are right !

To deliver gems to you

Just make her shield last a second longer. They were all so upset about her that her super went to extremely overpowered to kind of situational

Just push Colt and Bo I guess, you‚Äôll get new brawlers eventually.

What the fuck... why not just add a stat upgrade then...
---
Are you sure you‚Äôre not missing a ‚ÄúHumor‚Äù flair?
---
First, there is a high chance those who go AFK aren't even in this sub and are just casual players
---
Second, it is kind of your fault. If you play with randoms, there is always that chance of that happening, nothing you can do except playing with friends
---
How do you try to click a but accidentally click o which is on the opposite side of the keyboard

First idea i wouldn‚Äôt see as unreasonable, but the second one is too unrealistic

A person is not (normally) ready to reproduce at that age without many emotional consequences such as a stunted childhood let alone the extreme burden financially as soon as the person is an adult plus likely not having the father of the child there to help

I'm not even mad about the lag but 60% of words I'd use to describe the the trophy system would start with F.
---
And look barley's teaming

No offence but just hope Supercell can hear my voice u/Brawlstars

Get off ma dick its just an idea

Yeah makes me want to throw my intestines, large and small, up because it would take so long I would forgot the fact jessie was used in PHUCING PORN HOOVER DAMMIT!

Dude aiming the supers of those brawlers does nothing...
---
It wasn‚Äôt really meant to be, but thx
---
well just tell them they are bad before supercell thinks they are right and give them an insane buff for no reason. No one wants to repeat the same error they made with crow. he didnt need a buff, he was in fact really good before too.
---
XD but the event is basically over :P. Maybe next time or something
---
The player base and the passive encouraging of pay to rank up are the worst things about this game
---
Do all the Brock's 'cause there's so many. Normal, Breach, Boom Box, Lunar New Year and Hot Rod. They'll fill up the boardroom.

you better watch your mouth

Leon is pretty balanced right now imo.

hahaha this applies to me: I have 2 iPhone XS Max‚Äôs (1 for normal use and 1 for gaming) and 50-100 mbps internet (I don‚Äôt know  what it is currently my dad always changes it) but I lag unless I‚Äôm on data

Hey bro i visited ur recent post too :D im not a art maker but a meme maker,i did some ask in ur meme art :)

Really surprised you beat it with Bo on your te but great job!

Yeah,supercell should actually make original voice acting

what I do not understand are all downvotes, those who would have said something bad
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, little one‚Äù
---
Yep. Just happened to me on insane iii. 1200 damage remaining.
---
Bo was lagging a bit i think
---
He was afk for about 2 minutes 
---
El Primo was very good

I'm pretty sure the same people definitely wouldn't if she was real. To do that, they'd have to be very fucked up people

I didn't know many brawl star players attend E3 and have interest in pc console games. That's interesting.
---
ok but no tophat 9/10
---
BRUHHHHHH
---
How could it be balanced now?
---
Maybe no slowdown but a chip away health effect like crow with no slow down. But the super freezes them or does the slow down..... Almost a mix of crow and spike there I guess.
---
But those gnomes.... I love the gnomes
---
I like Ricoshet better
---
Why?
---
Would now be a good time to buy a mega box then? Presuming that the percentage stays the same for all box contents, you‚Äôd have a relatively high chance at multiple legendaries?

Hey what about me?

What are you even saying? The gameplay is fucking good bro. Are you high?

That Shelly saved your life you should have let her(him) square up.

Well we will just have to see if he does get the slash.
---
It's not the dynamikes that are the problem
---
It's the damn barley. If you play a primo/mortis/leon/Darryl, always aim for the barley first. Barleys aoe is very high and its very difficult to dodge him. Even in this video, the Leon was doing fine until barley showed up. Barleys are usually ignored at first and this becomes a huge problem later in the game

This is the next remodel.xd

naah

I find it very ironic that riochan actually used the same humor idea, put it on her meme template and posted it a month ago.

 At that time, that was considered as a self made art and not a meme template...

One time in 3rd grade, my teacher was yelling at a student and I was secretly playing on my phone. Opened up CoC and everybody heard it. People were giving me the "Oooh you playing on your phone" face but the teacher said "I don't care what that noise is," and kept yelling at the student. Pretty fucking lucky day if you ask me. Never got caught.

Thanks captain obvious
---
Higher stats and more ability does not equate to balance in any sense of the world
---
Why are there so many bad balance apologists in this sub? Has supercell been cucking your wives?
---
What are you thinking, this seems dumb and pointless. I‚Äôm no hater but when you‚Äôre buffing or making a character you make them balanced, quite ironic since not even Supercell can do this
---
Stupid idea, makes it far too easy to play them

Holy shit this one i like, but you could add more boxes in the middle.

I just thought Leon would look cute as a prince since he's a young boy (or looks like it to me) like the character. Then I thought, "hey why not pauper too?" so ok I added the pauper &lt;3 Icons look so simple though lol

this is a bit too similar to siege but it could work

you know guys....there is an app called brawl stats....it shows what maps are you going to have the next day and even recommends you brawlers

meanwhile, farming trophies all day to get mega boxes and still no legendary, currently at 6k trophies.

It is so frustrating, SUPERCELL FIX YOUR GAME SERVER !!!

You guys are just a bunch of snowflakes if even noob hurts you. Considering even this' child friendly' game does it.

But hes a different race
---
NWM is worse then no hat
---
Everyone:has legendary at 3000 trophies
---
Me:has 4100 and soesnt have any legenadies, mythics nor bibi and piper
---
I got my last brawler at 3300 and it was frank:(
---
The time will come where every f2p player will be maxed out. It only depends on the way how you play the game. Supercell  is going to make Brawl Stars more f2p friendly in future updates like Clash Royale but there is plenty of time for them to make it. Hope the next update is one of them. And i think you forgont one 0 in your reply (0.0075 ?).
---
What, tf
---
Ok, so let me get this straight. Trans people disgust you even tho they haven‚Äôt harmed you in ANY way and even if a trans person is nice you still hate him/her because he/she is trans? Ok seems legit. Also it doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with being a snowflake. Grow up.
---
Teamers suck
---
**#Bruce** I don't ^feel ^so ^good
---
I consider no hat Mortis worse than NVM
---
You have no idea how Reddit works I assume. Supercell has no control over this subreddit. We all work for free to make this place as good as possible, and just because we remove your low effort memes that users report doesn‚Äôt mean we are biased.

He has double dmg when both bombs hit the enemy...

Yeah, but you could pull her when she was low hp. Gene's super deals damage as well, or am I wrong?

If you are F2P the best thing you could spend gems on is token doublers. Mainly when their area at 29 gems discount. I save my gems for this. token doublers speeds up you progress anyway. Or by unlocking new brawlers or providing gold and power point to increase you power lvl and unlocking star powers. There is nothing better than the token doublers right now.. if you stop with token doublers you are slowing your progress.
---
How much brawlers with starpower do you have?
---
I know that, I mean make the area visible where it‚Äôs double damage and where it‚Äôs not double damage (yellow on the outside and red in the inside)
---
It's Russian mod by Ruler - Brawl Stars. I have it too om my Phone.
---
No hat Mortis in my opinion are uglier than NVM, whenever I see one I just want to get rid of that thing. They are also usually the ones that are unintelligent and trustworthy
---
Oh okay
---
How did you do that?
---
Nope; pam, frank, primo, bull, nita, jessieand shelly work fine for me
---
NO trans peoples like you who ruin fun of everyone for no reasons disgust me
---
Fuck no
---
No hat looks exactly like top hat but without the hat. NWM is just ugly

Wow

Im not even trans the fuck?

I got leon at 2500 trophies and spike at 3000

In the second brawler update, not second update
---
What is this, a bullet hell game? üòÇ
---
Still, it‚Äôs around 4 extra days worth of tokens. It‚Äôs the same amount of time. What I was saying is, to me, 4 days of grinding (the amount of time, not the loots) do not worth 29 gems, which may take weeks to get. I also do not care about coins/pp until I get a new brawler. When I buy a legendary, my legendary chance stay unchanged, which means it may take way less boxes for me to get my next legendary.

What about draws, hmm? You have been thwarted!
---
Hell no theyre not. Just because youve had one bad experience doesnt mean theyre all bad. I contacted them 3 times since the beta launch and theyve replied to me those three times very nicely and it was helpful. Idk what's your problem that youre trying to contact the suport for but maybe its not worth their time.

Well then read my other reply.

Supercell doesn't have to handicap each brawler just so a 7 year old can get more wins

The first message you get is always automated. If you continue asking and reply "no" when they ask if it helped, a person from the suport will reply

Get a whole army of him and instant 3 star

Looks sick!

I made him look like one;)

Some people never get humor...

Finally some good fucking memes

That's what I was thinking

Good meme but no need to react like that. Let‚Äôs all be like Poco here: ‚ÄúStill friends?‚Äù
---
I discovered it yesterday testing it on training grounds, I still don't have him, however they should put it on his information, same way as Piper,
---
  
---
Because it's important that enemies know how to counter attack it, if I see a Piper I run for it, if I am close it will do less damage, I didn't knew about Leon, if I knew it I would keep more distance of it.
---
Nope, do you want to check out my Mortis rework idea? No one really reacts to it :(.

Ik im late. Wanna roast op bc hes fucking annoying?
---
Like this is a very important and meaningful thing anyway...
---
Op is a bitch amirite
---
This is a purly PvP game. So looking for PvE type rewards its kinda pointless. I agree. Im at almost 9k trophies also missing many brawlers. Here is how to not get bored. Play only for daily tokens every day for couple of weeks. Collect many boxes. Open them all at once. If u get a brawler push that brawler and u will regain "fun". Then once it becomes boring u do the same again
---
Spike is my name spikeball is my game
---
You must be 9 too. Addicted to a phone game

Im 12 amd i live in turkey so i may not know THAT well

Yeah, except I‚Äôm the most unlucky person ever and still don‚Äôt have him at 9k trophies only 22 brawlers, 3 which I bought from the shop with my free2play gems. 120 boxes = nothing for me.

I have gotten a 600 mortis with randoms before. He‚Äôs high skill cap and let‚Äôs just leave it at that

Huh?
---
She didn't one shot you, she doesn't do enough damage.
---
Oof, I have 6K trophies and I had Spike, Tara &amp; Mortis
---
No it is 23
---
The only way I die with Mortis on this map is against Barley and Primos
---
Bringer of poisen
---
So does Brock's, Piper's, Tara's, Bo's, El Primo's, and all the brawlers who spawn something, are they throwers?
---
Yoda, I am

I can only translate the title and it says "new brawler"
---
Don't worry, your english is fine. They're just being picky assuming you're a native speaker.
---
Yeah ik right they really need to change that like ban it or make it one character per showdown like one barley is the limit
---
I think they havent done and wont do that because you are aiming the cactiƒ∫e not the fallen apart parts. (Same for Gene)
---
Cute!

Well actually you can get all legy faster buying token doublers than saving gems just for 1 brawlers also there are brawlers that have game changing star powers that are nice to get( darryll, jessie...... among others)

Its a rare moment, but every once in a while, carl's cart will run away leaving carl sitting like a rock. You can automatically trigger this by reaching 674 trophies as carl and then attacking a cactus 29 times. His cart will run away on the 30th hit.

---
Well. This got out of hand a bit, that your can be sure of.
---
Well that‚Äôs a fact though... and it‚Äôs part of the joke
---
If Mortis of all brawlers is getting a buff, then nita and gene need a buff
---
I absolutely hate how everything in the game besides the weekly special events are ladder. I can‚Äôt play my high trophy brawlers because of the risk of losing trophies on them. And I avoid game modes like gem grab because of these reasons - that it‚Äôs so easy to lose trophies and it‚Äôs non casual
---
So do bo‚Äôs and Brock‚Äôs and Tara‚Äôs, does that make them throwers too?
---
Would upvote but no sound.
---
ü§î

Whatever... But I don't need an advice... So stfu Mr 300 IQ brat!
---
Wow so original... I wish people can come up with different jokes and meme formats sometimes...
---
Thanks for your advice
---
0 LOSSES 0 DEATHS! Good meme btw and high effort!
---
Exactly this. There's simply no real way to play casually as it is. Ladder should be for more competitive players and for rewards, and casual mode should be for casual players.
---
Accuracy at it's finest, also that hina with mortis's hat thou
