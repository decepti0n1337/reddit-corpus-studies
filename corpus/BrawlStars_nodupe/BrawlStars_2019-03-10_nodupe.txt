Hey! Thanks for the kind words! :)

---
The bandwidth of the wifi connection matters very little. Brawl just needs a around 250 kb/s. There's a long list of potential issues of why the wifi connection doesn't perform as well as 4G/LTE. 
---
The 15ms "ping" you measured via WiFi is to the nearest physical server. Comparing both WiFi and 4G pinging a server in Frankfurt or Dublin is more realistic. You can compare the results. Besides this, depending on the device used there's a host of additional issues - from shared wifi/Bluetooth antennas, to impractical placement of said antenna, etc.
---
On my Twitter account you can also find some additional insights re connectivity for Brawl.
---
1, there could be a custom gamemode for it, other than showdown.
---
2 and 3, I agree but what if only the extra powerups would drop on the map, and the others would be just added to your account simply?
---
Thanks for removing life leech and please don‚Äôt bring it back 
---
üëåüèΩ
---
Actually, I unlocked Spike when I had 1500 trophies. 
---
I think that this is a great idea, but the drop rates are too high for a game that earns money by people donating money into it. I think that the easiest change would be just making the brawlers drop the total amount of powerups they have +1. So a 0 power brawler would drop 1, a 2 power brawler would drop 3, and a 30 power brawler would drop 31 etc. It also makes teaming up to defeat more powerful brawlers not as viable, since it is just as effective (and more rewarding if you win) to fight alone with 11 powerups, rather than two people with 5
---
Heh. I use Poco for aggro
---
What about both weekly challenges that take a long time to complete as well as daily?

Supercell would never give us a method of permanently farming gems or gold. And that‚Äôs not a fault of Supercell, it‚Äôs just by doing this it would undermine their entire currency system. Why buy gems when you can just farm it in Showdown?
---
Literally everyone who has tons of downvotes in this post has much more knowledge. Your ignorance from the truth is hysterical. Calling us wintraders isn‚Äôt helpful nor is it true. 
---
Hows that possible!? He didnt even get the Coming in bla bla bla thingy! Weird.....
---
Oh no you didn't
---
The droprates were just an idea to introduce the readers to my idea, I agree the perfect, balanced rate is not found yet but we won't find it out unless it's live, in the game. The numbers could be ok for solo showdown but I feel like duo showdown should have a different odds-system.
---
I want a kill:death ratio counter in brawl
---
Si we :V
---
Farming would take some time, but I agree, the gem odds might be too high in my post.
---
Maybe that caused the update error.
---
Uh maybe just credit towards a mega box- one box for 100 kills
---
It‚Äôs a novel idea but unfortunately Supercell would probably veto it.
---
Exactly what is this knowledge? And what‚Äôs so ‚Äúhysterical‚Äù? Your bullshit is what‚Äôs hysterical here. Cheating is cheating, simple as that and the fact that you‚Äôre willing to try and justify it, that‚Äôs also fucking hysterical üòÇ
---
Good!

Check u/SrGrafo, the original meme format creator

The 4th barrel somehow had a bunch of rockets loaded in it for it's super
---
I would say to make them less brawler based because I didn't get poco until like 3 months into the game after getting like 6 other brawlers before him (one was a legendary)
---
Is a very good idea, because you also got skins gold tickets and gems i like it
---
well, downvote me if you want, but if i point with a flashlight to a bush to search for something, unless its made of a deflective material, the result on sight conditions is the same. for this im also taking in mind that 99% of the time bs takes place in the day, so lets not go about the results in nighttime cuz even of the result would be different, it doesn't apply to the fame anyways :/ although, if we had "caves" or "tunnels" in the game, it would be a cool sp to have better sight in those places (ik gem grab is on a cave but im not taking that in mind since it seems to be pretty well lighted there)
---
vc √© br??
---
Legendary drop rate: Am I a joke to you?
---
Oh yeah just noticed that. I Guess this means 2 spikes in 1 day
---
Ok
---
Thank you, i enjoy your complement
---
Very cool
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt argue with me‚Äù this is exactly what I was talking about. 
---
I will always give some leeway, meaning I will admit when I‚Äôve been wrong on a lot of points.
---
So I have to ask you, when you say crow can beat pam are you talking about a 1v1 in showdown or in gem grab with teams? 
---
Gem grab the best game-mode so it is naturally the best choice for pro players. If we are arguing about gem grab I‚Äôll admit that a crow can win for sure because he has room to retreat a bit knowing his mid can fire a few shots to help keep the pam from pushing super far forward. In showdown crow will lose because he simply can‚Äôt fight a pam head on and stand his ground, he needs room to move which showdown doesn‚Äôt provide when there are other players or poison spread in the late game. 
---
TL:DR he can win in gem grab, I was talking about showdown
---
Im a crow main and uhhh (shhh no one tell him)
---
I feel like Brock is overrated and definitely not top 3 right now. Why is he S-Tier on Showdown? He does not work in general on Feast or Famine, Island Invasion, Cavern Churn, Stormy Plains. Only really good on Double Trouble, Thousand Lakes and Dune Drift. Feel like he should be B-Tier or A-Tier at the most.
---
Use the communication app Rune. You put in your trophies you have, and when you press quickplay, you'll be placed in a voice chat with another person with the same trophy level.
---
I feel like a solid kill incentive would solve it. 1 kill = 1 trophy 
---
Only in less that 300 trophies, this a +500 trophies tier list
---
Dud you are so lucky to get Carl ! XD

Go commit reverse SAD!

Thank you :)

I have like 450 trophies for shelly and I think shes great
---
Haha thank you, hopefully Supercell will see this!
---
I used to play  Robo Rumble and got 2 Star Power Mortis randoms
---
For some reason we defended it for 5:40 minutes
---
Not yet, but I have seen several concepts of daily challenges that I personally find boring with few rewards that make me lazy to make the challenge. :)
---
Supercell said they dont want one wide gaps to walk through. Other than that, great idea!
---
Good bot 
---
Though the concept is kind of cool
---
please just let this gag die
---
Ok? I dont play this game for hours every day and theres something called burn out and taking breaks
---
OwO
---
What concerns me is that he will likely smash it and cellos are expensive as hell
---
I like his voice especialky when he says his more mafia based lines eg. let‚Äôs settle this beef, I smell a rat

Woowi, nice!

That's called pre-ordering

It's not a photoshop, but a p r I vv te server instead

cuz shes OP
---
Then you‚Äôre just good enough to play him without teaming. 
---
Tag nsfw
---
You‚Äôre dumb totally not paying attention to my point üòÇ
---
I don't as well but make the difference between 1 year and 3 months 
---
I love the weekly quests.
---
This idea isn‚Äôt well thought out. By people dropping gems it would encourage people to team in order to get the gems. A better way is to have you get 1 trophy for every 2 kills in solo showdown.
---
LOL
---
I found 2. Nita being spike and primo bush camping
---
Yeah, but still. He does super low damage, and on his own without teammates or help from other enemies in showdown, he can rarely come in handy. Although I do understand what your saying.

Np your example with the cod is called or

How do you get the in a team with the same brawler?

I have leon

totally agree

Team or be teamed on

Damn man you lucky

How many refunds did you do there buddy lmao

No one time gaps pls
---
Trying to be nice btw
---
So awesome!!!!!, but 8 is to long how about 4 to 2.5
---
Wth I made this 
---
You bought gems, used them and got a refund. Brawl Stars saw this and did what they did to your account can‚Äôt blame them. This is your fault. That‚Äôs if you did what I just said and this is the only possible explanation as to why your gems are negative. If you didn‚Äôt do this then go and contact help and support.
---
thanks S2

Pretty sick man!

No wonder 6ix9ine's in jail

Actually according to the game a Showdown victory is either first or second , but you're right it's a bit too much

Who said Boom Beach didn‚Äôt do well

To an extent I agree but there needs to be a limit on how much it stacks.  If it stacks too much you can be hitting people with an awful lot of damage  every tick.  Maybe stacks up to 2 or 3 darts worth.

Thank you.

In the Q&amp;A Thread they answered this question. They will not implement a system that rewards for kills in the near future and I‚Äôm happy with that

Can we use this on our website  [https://brawland.com/](https://brawland.com/) ? We would love it to let others know which brawler they can use in specific game modes!

I think its more accurate to say that on average (across a large number of people), the average number of boxes required to get Carl is 1. When looking at it individually, we might be lucky (getting Carl in &lt;83 boxes) or unlucky (getting Carl in &gt;83 boxes) \[assuming 83 was the correct number of boxes already determined\]

See, Crow doesn't need a buff; He's so good that the game loses connection when you get him.

You mean the pathetic joke that was taken over in under an hour that went nowhere? That one?

It all started with the random rarted kid who wanted to put his ruler in a cactus

Why some people get more brawlers in starting and others who are having more trophies and are playing from the soft launch

Still have very less brawlers

Wasn't she the worst brawler one year ago?
---
i literally hate siege. if you get stuck with one person who decides to stay back it's over. it's almost like the winning team is decided on which team has people who aren't stupid 
---
What.
---
Yeah but that's intentional. You can easily get hit by all 3 coins if you are right behind the person who got hit. Penny is designed to prevent the team from walking behind each other in a group. Poco is not supposed to be this way. He does low damage over a large area and heals his team. 1600-1700 is too much damage for a healer.

I hate how supercell supports teaming but doesn‚Äôt like the idea to award kills with trophies. Like what the fuck, even if people are only teaming with one more person a 2v1 is still way too unfair. Especially since the showdown maps get very small and 10 people still remain and you get cornered by 2 teams, you still end up losing trophies. I doubt supercell would add this but if they did the rewards would be much smaller. We can‚Äôt even get a free brawl box now, I got 16 coins today for free and I‚Äôm almost maxed, all I need is coins but 16 coins are literally nothing. I liked showdown and was my favorite mode when I first played Brawl Stars back in October, 2017. But now with the event modifiers and the teamers I only play for the star token. Supercells are a bunch of cucks, I love them and hate them with a passion. 
---
What about primo and crow lol
---
Nice
---
I love this Map!! So good!!
---
Maybe he has the same effect as barley with his Super where more attacks don‚Äôt stack in a certain time frame(invincibility frames, approx 1sec for brawlers like rico)
---
I also have him and the devs confirmed he is getting  a remodel
---
You get extra xp
---
This is less about Darryl being a bad brawler and more about you don‚Äôt know how to use him. I have  both a power level 9 and level 4 Darryl and I‚Äôm still able to beat people. 
---
My eyes!

r/itswooooshwith4os

He even steals from YouTube too

New Rico is cool and all but I‚Äôd kill for that Bo remodel. He‚Äôd look so much better.

I would had a mental break down 
---
I dont get it lmao
---
And Ur back
---
Oh lol u just don‚Äôt open them... also you save boxes so that if a new brawler comes out you have a better chance of getting that brawler
---
Me either.

What software did you use?

---
Concepts aren't really much of a concern here cause they have their watermarks. But the memes... yeah report him for that.

No because spinning isn't only for teaming
---
Lmao Dyna was putting in work on yall safe
---
Good drawing but that‚Äôs colt‚Äôs weapons
---
He's saying let them regen for Ur super
---
Well maybe it could be a certain number of spins per second but people would still probably find another way to signal
---
The reason why this is "invalid" is because it's how you play the brawler, and how everyone else plays. You cant just rank them.

Before beta U could get them from boxes

Hmmm.. Interesting idea, also I would suggest swinging the weapon rather than slamming it 
---
Ok I will
---
Penny combined with her face
---
The spike scored accidentally on their own goal but it's not like anyone has the reaction speed to realize they have the ball when they are already moving backwards into their goal
---
but the high trophy players or people that do team are maxed and dont need gold or gems

I approve of this skin. Please put it in.

Hello A question the people that do team in showdown should not be sanctioned or any warning?
---
Really bad idea, mortis should approach all bushes carefully and dash as needed. There are Much more brawlers who need a buff/change 
---
oh brawal stars my favorite game.
---
How do u add a flair
---
I have been playing for 3 months and am at 7k trophies ur slow

Is there any problem if I'm not from us?

Congrats on level 5! üëè

Tara explodes into cards. I guess something like that for everyone?

Nita is so e d g y.

Ayear and you have 5800 trophies? Didn't know it was possible to push that slowly

lol
---
Petition to give Mortis one more tile of bush vision because he has a lamp. I think Mortis needs this because he is the only brawler who cant bush check.

No.

My guy should really stop playing with randoms then... lol

You can‚Äôt get more than 12...

This is purely fake. Take my downvote sir

wait there are daily challenges in game?
---
How did you change the font in your BrawlStars name?

Nah he has 24/23 brawlers lulz

Good edit dude! Keep it up!

I hope yoy asked her.
---
my record is about 5 min. 46 
---
this is lvl 10, same HP as bo same damage as dyna
---
There are no daily challenges, but I have seen several concepts of daily challenges that I personally find boring with few rewards that make me lazy to make the challenge. :)
---
No,crow is the most annoying...look, shelly main, you gotta GIT GUD and learn how to dodge his shots.
---
Oh so this is what the new matchmaking brought eh.
---
i mean.... swinging throwing? idk
---
Hello Supercell !
---
I am a big fan of Brawl Stars and I would like to translate Brawl Stars in Romanian , because there are so many Romanians playing Brawl Stars , I don't want to get paid , I just would like to translate the game in Romanian
---
Wat...
---
Will Leon and tara get voice?
---
Do you like?
---
And even if I have the time, I use the losing screen to get out before the other random and send him a friend request.
---
Except that time when I sent him the request and he had too many...
---
You're right, but something about the way they laugh, Piper and Miss Valentine, makes it hard to ignore
---
How about a brawler that deals a constant stream of damage in an area, and can't move while they attack? Imagine Pam's station but it deals damage instead. They would have one ammo slot cause their attack could basically just go on forever if you don't press it again to cancel.
---
How old are u? Everyone swears here on reddit bro so FUCK SHIT FUCK
---
....... it‚Äôs a crosspost
---
Hes balanced, tho I liked old darryl more than now lol hes still good and fun to play....
---
Man Supercell banned me from game for scolding burdens vulgarities  
---
Wut
---
should add didn't get new brawlers for how long
---
Lol
---
Will there be daily or weekly challanges to give rewards?
---
He's not a vampire, he's a gravedigger

i respect your sportsmanship and agree that matchmaking is broken

more like carl after using his super
---
Yea, a 4k in the top 100 
---
I got Pam and Mortis in the same box.
---
When will you fix your matchmaking? XD
---
300 trophies player who reached them with only 1 brawler is not same powerful as player who have all brawlers at 300 trophies...
---
Just make it like total trophies of your team like if my friends are
---
5000
---
Me - 8000 
---
And 7000
---
Total : 20 000 to battle vs team around 19500-20500
---
Or make matchmaking about leagues like clash royale's arena
---
If im 8000 my team mates have to be at my league - 8000 to 9000 and my emenys too so it will be fair cuz im battling with players at 3000 trophies for team mates while im 8000 trophies cmon thats the main reason to dont play with random players while my friends are at high trophies of course i will win easer with them üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ 
---
That too.
---
He's good fun to use
---
First?
---
I like the idea,but the challenges are too hard to complete them all in one week
---
What if a tara makes a hole in the trees and a dynamique jumps in ?
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ sorry
---
Will the brawlers that don't have voices (Darryl, Tara , spike , Leon) ever get voices ?
---
Thanks Ryan for confirm!
---
Note: I'm the one who used this image to make Dynamike more realistic, so I can copy myself. 
---
But he id trash as assassin and too weak for heavy basicly too much skill needed to play with him ;-;
---
Shit post
---
I had a problem with the app everytime Im playing the game in my android I   get a blackout the screen and going to the main screen of my mobile. So then I need to connect again to the game.
---
Apparently my android is compatible with the game. 
---
Somebody knows what is happening? 
---
And something something you're a shooter
---
I‚Äôd love to have them. 
---
Can i ?
---
Well, the legendary little one is just fleeing lol
---
Why you bullyng me?
---
Good map, but this has a showdown/bounty feel to it. I'd love this for one of those
---
What's great about this is that your flair is poco and poco is the one who says that line
---
Omg that's sooo me and i feel really guilty because of it since i spent a lot of time and some money into the game.
---
But why
---
A donation system would be way better
---
Repost
---
This should fuckin happen we brawlers would luv it also every challenge should be based on players throphy so that everyone could enjoy it
---
Yassss
---
Darrly would dominate on this
---
Question :
---
What programming languages i must know to work for Supercell?
---
It‚Äôs impossible first of all: he ain‚Äôt released and even if you unlocked him, you can‚Äôt see him in your Brawler list so how did you update him to level 9 to get his star power ?
---
If the blocks in the middle were destroy able, then yes
---
Really? 
---
Thank you. Would you prefer a simmetric map or random like this? 
---
And this is why we don't aim our attacks, kids! 8)
---
You need more attention. Can i post these to the brawler gangs and share it on brawlstars again?
---
Well if I am actually this trophy amount, it is possible. You know how it only adds 2 trophies for a win but -7 trophies for a lose when Brawler is over 900 trophies or sth. Plus, the seasonal reset per week... And the time a 18k troph player played must be really long. So it is possible.
---
But  do u have to collect the drops? So could other players get ur rewards laying on the floor ?
---
?
---
This is so easy. Congrats on getting Spike!
---
Deserves way more upvotes, probably cause you posted it so early in the morning 
---
r/brawlmaps
---
I don‚Äôt see the problem with it. It‚Äôs just names.
---
Finally someone mentions it
---
Oh no so he is legendary? I guess I wont get him then /s
---
Omigod
---
Ayeeee!!!! *you effing stole my post* It's alright tho :)
---
I agree
---
It would get added to your account automatically with like some kind of cool animation, only the power cubes would drop on the map
---
XD
---
Our  team always piper,shelly and mortis and  we never win in  siege
---
Where where I put my friend... well, we know it now 
---
You should buy gems or open boxes.
---
twas a joke bro
---
Lol yeah you're right, my highest is 510 so wouldn't know üòÇ, didn't know the trophy wins dropped that low! Although I've noticed over 500 you can drop 12 trophies losing siege, wonder how many you can lose at 900 
---
Ik what Woosh is but why did he woosh me ?
---
I read the title in that "black guy on a mountaintop saying ok meme" voice
---
Wait a minute, you use life cell to play a super cell game?

What says you that this is a joke ?
---
Repost with different title
---
IT'S MY POST!

BOTH ARE MINE! 
---
KairoTime.

what u said made sense so prolly a joke or a poorly planned lie so ill pick the more optimistic one
---
Oh lol
---
How many is too many on brawl stars?
---
What box?
---
&gt; **I'm bored**
---
Lmao
---
Thought both titles worked too well, so... 
---
What are those other 2 pets?
---
That would be more op than jessi herself lol
---
That looks pretty even 
---
But, there is a Jessie there...
---
Ive gained 100+ trophies in a push. I usually also lose around 80 so it looks like I did nothing. Sometimes 10 games will keep me at the same exact position before them all
---
Yeah thanks
---
Nice rage
---
&gt;(ignore background noise)
---
*immediately turns sound on*
---
Carl's Super is like Valkyrie
---
Info : big brother of Jessie, became a baseballer instead of a mechanic. Didn't stop him from building some machines 
---
Attack : batter up! 
---
Caddy swings forward his trusty bat and walks brawlers. Able to wack away distant hits too! 
---
Super : baseball 3000
---
Caddy whacks 3 "baseballs" which chases enemies. However it does less damage the further it travels 
---
Star power : batter 9000
---
With a modified bat. Caddy can now hit the baseball-3000s harder making them travel MUCH faster
---
Yeah of course /s
---
wOaH tHaT sUcKs
---
Nita is a real master of disguises 
---
I little bit empty
---
Looks good!
---
This is a good idea but it wouldn't help in the higher trophy ranges where people are already maxed and where teaming is the most prevalent
---
Yes...
---
The current heist maps don‚Äôt really favour bull anymore, with them having either 
---
1.too many walls, where rico and barley are dominant
---
2.too open, where anything with any sort of range is dominant. 
---
3.No walls in front of the safe. This decreases the value of bull‚Äôs Super on the safe.
---
Bull seems rather good on siege since he has dive capability and a good health pool to resist attacks and pick up bolts, while keeping the other popular tank, primo, away.
---
7/7 brawlers
---
I mean the problem with siege for me is that I meet teammates that don't attack the IKE when our bot spawns and some dont collect bolts and in the end I go on the losing streak which is TWICE the normal throphy loss... quite irritating sometimes
---
STOP IT FORTNITE!
---
Default dancing?--
---
I'm confused what
---
I had no idea where to put him after putting down every other brawler
---
The two brawlers at the bottom are wearing great vests.
---
Its on deutch I won
---
Exactly I am offended
---
Wow that‚Äôs awsome dude
---
Thats.. not how woosh works
---
Those lores were terrible! I wish there was a deeper part to the story
---
Hey guys. So I use an older device (Huawei P9 light) to play the game and sometimes it is lagging and I can't play properly. Can you please fix it so I can play on 100% like I use to. Thank you. I hope you can do something..üòä
---
There is credit! Bottom right.
---
That's amazing art, great work

But i accidentally opened 2 big boxes i was saving...
---
And me too also as well
---
The real "Everyone is here"
---
Can't a dynamike jump into one of the corners?
---
He is pretty balanced but having his super a big faster would be kind of nice 
---
gta 5 online
---
I used to main barley till they nerfed him in heist so I gor really good at throwers üòÇ also their Piper had shit aim and bull kept running away when he took damage but we barely won he had 11% on our safe
---
I lost 90 trophies thanks to random el primos last night
---
Haha ur being sarcastic
---
This is really well made
---
OMG I REALLY LIKE THIS
---
That's what you get for going Jessie
---
Rip ricochet
---
Can you add any New Brawler in 4000 trophies road?üòÅ
---
But you should make some bridge, otherwise bulls and shellys would just camp at the landing spot while some throwers damage the safe
---
And this is why bull-teamers does not last long.
---
Uh oh watch out the bottom can be cropped out and stolen without linking you
---
139 isn't that low I mean c'mon the Colt and bull fine but our barley and Piper wtf 
---
This can't denounced players 
---
petition to ban this kind of legal karma whoring 
---
He can, but is a disadvantage for he and his team.
---
Mind you their colt is at 0
---
They must be vest friends
---
Funny but low effort...
---
Then jump out or attack when the enemy is retreating!
---
Pls donate me frank
---
And elixer
---
139 is like really low its like if you played one day then all brawlers you have should be at 139
---
Lol u gotta be level 9 or 10 and get the starpower
---
It's rewind time.
---
poco mortis darryl
---
Ya, buy when we see it remodel, it will be more expensive 
---
ƒ∞t ia good but shelly use shotgun Not akimbo
---
nice
---
I had idea in my mind to make a concept for a brawler that is similar to Bo and can do double damage. Because I didn't had idea how he would look i just took Leon's model and some of Leon's mechanics. If i would spent a bit more time to make my model and attack mechanic (still similar to Bo's) he wouldn't look like Leon.
---
In your online match, you do not have his star power
---
Buffing attack wouldn't hurt
---
Sketch
---
Me too
---
You actually need dyna star power wich you can unlock after reaching level 9 with him. But you can still do it in friendly matches causes all brawler are directly level10 (wich mean they have their stars powers)
---
This Happens Yesterday to me
---
Oh... Umh... Oke?
---
Forgot the doubler
---
And what should I do with 200 gems, I prefer spending them in skins, I have only Rico rico and in my other account that I use with my brother santamike
---
Uhm... Oke?
---
My boxes only contains this
---
Another case of noobs being noobs
---
His star power makes him jump using his dynamites
---
But he does 260√ó3√ó2 (power 1)
---
It's a glitch
---
Can you donate it to me...I wanna use crow 
---
Ya, I bought him for 30 but I want skins and I m sad for not buy in my good account darryl skin and santamike, :(
---
I know 
---
Thanks man LOL. Gene was the mythic brawler I'd want. But I'll take it lol
---
I see your point but the game already isnt fair, this is balancing it out some.
---
His health is kinda low and I barely find him in boxes I
---
 have him level 2
---

---

Guys don‚Äôt upvote this it isnt the original
---
Do you think that Carl should be changed after he comes out? If yes, how would you guys change him?
---
Let me translate this into poor f2p
---
Khm khm "Is this some kind of peasant joke that i'm too rich to undersgand?"
---
P.S i'm f2p 
---
Nita and jessie has laser eyes
---
I know how annoying it is to lose trophies due to teamers but you can't lose trophies if you join the team or if u can't join them cuz of having a different brawker then u can just manage to hide or if u have enough skills, u can kill them also but breaking trusts is an action against humanity. If it happens unknowingly,  it's understandable but doing this intentionally is an action against humanity. 
---
As I see in the above video, there was no team up against you, it was u who went there teamed up and betrayed. Do you think that's right? 
---
E
---
Yeah, skins or save for a newer brawler. Carl is coming at 59.

How I'm more likely to win a legendary brawler apart from opening boxes 
---
I downloaded TestFlight and now how do I become a tester? 
---
I know that I have to have a code from developer but how do I get that?
---
Haha facts 
---
Why? There‚Äôs not a single bush in this entire map 
---
Can't you get a joke?
---
oh my god my favourite brawler this is definatly going as my wall paper
---
I got double Leon before
---
Okay, if you did not like this, look at my previous maps...
---
Oh, I also used Leon to push to 1K to get Brock.
---
I agree with this post completely, someone big notice this one. Take my upvote
---
In all honesty, that's a rework I'd be completely fine with (where they completely change up how a character looks, like with what they had done to Mortis &amp; Ricochet).
---
Idk why you got downvoted. This comment is good.
---
Where'd the 131 other trophies come from?
---
Hey, I think you should give the begginers a legendary or mythic brawler, just so the players feels good about his luck in gameüôÉüôÉ
---
You could even create a new brawlers of this type that is not that OP, but just having a mythic or legendary brawler with you will get players to be happier
---
I know bro, that's the intention :v
---
I want it! How can I get him?
---
Bro... This is... a freaking masterpiece... A bit heart-warming too!! I just love how the presence Rico has the past Rico's back... this is wonderful!!!
---
Ricochet better c:
---
Yeah wonder Brad doesn‚Äôt push his characters that much but he upgrades them for his challenges, I don‚Äôt know if You know this but SD isn‚Äôt viable at 400+ trophies
---
I need all of them! 
---
When will this update come out?
---
RIP Ricochet. Looks like Thicco is sent by the boss of the bad robos to destroy the prototypes (first Ricochet, then Barley and Darryl and maybe Carl?)
---
D99 Drilling perhaps
---
Will you have the ability to change the joystick? I personally find the joystick too big for my crappy phone with a small screen. I would really like the ability to change the size of joystick so my character's movement seems more responsive.

Weird, that's pretty low considering you have never gotten a mythic or leggy? Did you advance very fast?

Around the end of this month

Stop considering, start uploading. People are dying to see pro matches, screw the commentary! Just play something in the background(relaxing DEATH METAL sounds)

I honestly think this is extremely balanced, as this 40k was saved up within a span of 7-8 months, so for all the time getting roughly 400 gems is barely worth all that saving (regardless of it being unintentionally). Also apparently 2% of players are affected, so assuming 200k play this game that would mean 4,000 players are affected (which is kind of a lot).

Free stuff in a game we support. The reason the game even makes money if from us. The "free" stuff they give us is literly nothing it's pixels in a game and when you Revive so thing as pointless as 12 coins it's annoying because we spend our time and money on the game. 
---
This is what God looks like
---
This was posted when the game went global, people thought it was a good idea, but it isn't. Basically you will now play 1v2 the whole match as the player with no powercubes will be useless against a team wutg equal powercubes
---
Delete this. It is useless
---
Now it is fixed :)

How is that bad? Dynamike can kill mortis pretty easily.

I imagined more of a Bowler characters like from clash

And dont ever go there

Yes it does

But the safe isn't 1 tile. The safe's hurtbox is a bit extend to the nearest tiles, and anyways, just breaking 1 fance whould be enought to reach it.

yeah, but he can support his teammates, if they aren't mindless randoms trying act like dynamike, just by killing the enemies then have his teammates pick it up

I don't like to believe the Leon and Nita are related, Like how I say Bo is the father of Nita and how Tari is the mother of Leon they're both stealthy both hide their identitys, for Bo being the father of Nita is that they both have fearsome and iconic animals and that they are both tribal and that's my thearoy a BrawlStars Thearoy thanks for listening.

You know that ricos bullets travel further for every  time they hit a wall
---
It isn‚Äôt even hard to win with him, you‚Äôre just not that good 
---
Absolutely, but the problem is you get a lot of points for doing damage even if you rush in and die shooting. This is awful bounty play.
---
I would change it to give barely any point for damage that is regenerated. Points for damage would only be awarded if someone killed them, and the killshot would get a minor bonus.
---
Then bonus points for killing gem carriers. Bonus points over time for holding gems. Negative points for dropping gems, more negative the closer you are to their spawn. Soccer goals. Soccer holding while you are winning. Killing soccer holder, more when they are closer to your goal. Bonus for blowing up obstacles that are scored through, adjusted for proximity to their goal. Negative for that if you it's your barrier and they score.
---
See, I just don't think they assign star player points right.
---
Yeah I saw that and was just like noooo
---
Yep

Very nice

3: the type of brawler (legendary, epic, etc.)

---
Well what time did you finish with? You weren't in terrible shape at the 3 min mark.
---
1/5*
---
~SUPREME-MO IS HERE~
---
He really is
---
It may seem like a dumb piece of advice, but I find it‚Äôs really not that hard to play around as long as you keep it in mind. Duo showdown is a easy to time it and make sure you‚Äôre far enough to dodge and escape. Other modes it‚Äôs a little tough especially if you need to be in their base for extended periods. Wait it out is the only option but it‚Äôs not that op imo
---
Throwers would be OP on this.
---
Also on the topic will you add a trading system? (I.e brawler for a Brawler)
---
one more victory in showdown and your mortis will be with 666 trophies...
---
Still that's pretty good survival time even with randoms. He obviously wasn't trying to tank the match, I think it even worked out fairly well. Its a game where there's literally no form of communication with random teammates. Take the good with the bad, and this one wasn't bad.
---
Mr Popo
---
This too happens to me sometimes. A big solution for this is to try to focus on 1 thing at a time. So for example, win your lane, then pressure mid, then protect your gem carrier etc..
---
If youre too busy with trying to do 2 things at once it gets very difficult
---
Once I saw triple Pams, Triple Ricos, and triple Jessies exceed over 7+ minutes
---
I'm sorry if a joke isn't accurate. Might be because it's a joke? Hmm
---
Is this a jojo reference?
---
This cool, but we can easy break the fence (dynamike) and shot with long range (piper) and i like it!!!!
---
But better if you put ships little bit farther from each other

Whoa double pam is already op, triple Pam is definitely crazy !!!

Really interesting idea especially for the control objective, since teams would be forced to prioritize one lane over.

1% or a little lower I believe

Real money? 0$

1% on the bright side it‚Äôs a higher chance than epics still

My Bo was at 450 but u dropped and my total trophies is 9k.

Guys, please don‚Äôt do the same mistake as cr. They added a lot of legendary characters and didn‚Äôt focus on the low rarities. You are doing well by adding a super rare!

you didn't make this it's a program

Barely a skin.

Lwarb beta... u aint fooling me

I don't even play this game, but this looks pretty cool!

Probably only to you since it could cause some complication if everyone sees it

I just took the image from an old fan kit I had on my computer
---
Bulls having a pull... 
---
Yeah, pretty good concept though. All the high players need something else to look forward to.

El Primo is a heavyweight luchador, so it makes sense him to jump to take down his enemies.

This is a really good map. You can tell that the creator went into detail instead of just placing large groups of blocks and bushes. Props to you and I hope this makes it into the game!
---
For sure he‚Äôs gonna be nice

If you get approved as an artist that is fine but if it‚Äôs available for everyone people will make inappropriate skins

Hi Supercell.
---
If in some future update you can play in a team with the same brawl
---
Yeah especially for the people above 10k. I originally intended all of these rewards for them but I realized that would be kinda unfair
---
I‚Äôm just wondering what that has to do with what I said?
---
Maybe you could customize your attack animation 
---
Gimme info im intrested
---
 No just his regular attack
---
No oof
---
Oh wow
---
Colt uses mini-miniguns instead of guns.
---
Ohhh that‚Äôs a super good idea I‚Äôve never thought of that. Maybe post it on a seperate post?

I think a good way to find active bands is to join family bands (Ex, joining a Nova Feeder) because most of those bands are well kept and are active

Of all the things we want fixed as a community, I would hope this is the very last one

Oh, I didn't think of it like that. Maybe they could get like a week ban if they do, but I like the approved artists idea more

It wasn‚Äôt on your post

Amazing work bro I really like this one
---
100% not. She is super map dependant. A lot of these players are low/mid level player so she may seem OP there but in high level gameplay, or even as low at 7k or 8k, she isn't OP
---
This has so many comments but no upvotes gut can you lower the OG dynamike skin to 5.6k

flair checks out

The brawlstars one should have been a broken phone.
---
James Charles needs to do the makeup....... Devil arises
---
well bush checking is always a problem for piper but I feel like on this map it‚Äôs easier since most of the bushes are in long, straight lines so that you can cover a lot of area with one shot
---
If you guys couldn‚Äôt tell I‚Äôm drawing each brawler from beginning of trophy road all the way to the legendary. I know this isn‚Äôt that good but hey hahaüòÖ

A primo could jump in the middle and wait out the game unless there's thrower opponents
---
Basically like a fat buck shot instead of the bird shot he normally shoots. 
---
Is there a way to be a beta tester or something like that
---
Woww
---
Thats a nice idea, I want to try kicking spike into walls
---
No one beats the bull
---
A h h a
---
This post says he's the only brawler who cant check bush, well guess what he's also the only brawler who can dodge and weave around like a f#ckin ninja, and yes i have mortis but i dont come here complaining about unnecessary requirements because i still kick ass playing him
