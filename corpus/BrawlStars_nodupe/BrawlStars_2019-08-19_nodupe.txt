Oh he used taras super to break one barrel, then I jumped in using piper's

I think this subreddit needs a push in strategy content. Maybe dedicate one day a week for a thread about techniques for each brawler. Maybe post one big mega thread with links to smaller threads about certain aspects of the game.

Mr. steal your soul

Mortis proposed star power: Ghost dash. When he dashes at a wall twice he will pass through the wall, making this type of bs impossible

I would be thinking have Siege in the rotation with Gem Grab so there wouldn‚Äôt be Gem gGrab everyday

Is It humanly possible to like request to have negative gems so you can buy something?

Like I have 206, want to buy something 209 
---
I would be able to request it to be negative 3?

Quality meme but whats with the random mark

The record is 16 I think. I don‚Äôt know if anyone did higher than that.

Ive got leon, bibi, and rosa. Bull is next, then Frank
---
Eh, randos from discord will net you at least 30 even if they are complete shit.
---
I said powerpoints
---
My suggestion would be to add an easier way to make tournaments in friendly games, like an integrated point system or the bottom player can't play and more. Hope I win!

---
Its nice that they tried,and honestly they arent so bad
---
Even tho its not your idea you do not have permission to karma farm with another artist's art
---
HAHA nice catch
---
mr.lag should be a epic brawler
---
My suggestion is to have weekly fan art competitions on a certain day of the week.
---
Idk lol
---
Mr lagg is common lol
---
Nice man, I don't have leon yet unfortunately
---
I have mr lag at 700 trophies. He‚Äôs so op, he freezes brawlers
---
Not really my cup of tea to take more time to set those matches up. I know mom maxing is great, but the less time I spend grinding is also good for me.

I‚Äôm kinda late but gonna post it here anyway

Honestly if you save them you‚Äôll get more value out of it if they release new brawlers you might get a chance at it, but since you‚Äôre saving boxes you‚Äôll get less progress from leveling

Power points for someone i bareley use
---
Huh, guess I learned something new
---
problem is with stealing boxes means that the person you stole it from will target you for the rest of the match until you die so that'll be a major problem and another problem with bush camping is that most brawlers i see checking bushes are brawlers with range so getting close to them is a big problem
---
The people are way too demanding...

More flairs and categories for posts. Examples could be Videos, Competitive, and even individual Brawler flairs for individual Brawler posts. 
---
If someone's posting a guide on Shelly, it can be flaired with Shelly and Guide for example. This would help to better categorise posts and give users a short and sweet overview of the post by simply looking at the post flairs.

You are still 4000 YOU are 8000 I am 13000 and I also don't have any legendary. JK I have Leon and Spike.
---
ü§î BIG BRAIN
---
I mean they could make any skin limited time only. It would be a bit shady of a way to drive up sales but they could.  I don't think it would work as well because the community would probably catch on fast and just stop buying skins until things change.

:000   This is so good

Am I the only one who doesn't have internet issues?

If you have a mythic, your lucky enough

el primo still cancels his attack and super with his super.
---
Darryl's is a bit too strong I think making them lose 1 ammo or 1 and a half at most would be somewhat balanced

2+ Shelly with band-aid. Now that's a nightmare

Thank you! :')

Good point. I‚Äôm a semi-f2p (I buy things rarely with irl money) and I‚Äôve been waiting to get band-aid for robo-rumble bc I really need it for a lot of tokens. Frank with sponge isn‚Äôt really working anymore for me
---
Check the truth u/mtswalker said
---
WhAt Do YoU mEaN, ShElLy ShOuLd WiN iT
---
wait, betraying is a good thing! you're giving teamers what they deserve
---
Well then the Frank just waits until Primo uses it or just kills Primo.
---
Bruh!
---
My goodness, what an idea!
---
Why didn't I think of that?
---
Good point.
---
it literally says me and the boys not the specific brawler you peasant.

Lies

Question : is shinymoon76 another one of ur accounts on another platform? If so, this is awesome! But if not, please don‚Äôt steal :3
---
It's not even that good for us to "get out". That caption just pissed me off. GG
---
it also shows their star powers, the one on the far left is shelly star power band-aid, have a brain before commenting PEASANT.

No, it may be a scrapped idea for his second starpower

I just spent 3 min trying to find the missing brawler, it was crow

Ah yes, Bush campers.

All Shellies (including boss) are a common thing in high trophy milestone

And I... am... El Primo.

Ah, thank you!

Amazing.
---
The blue-ray has already out for like 3 weeks tho.

Let's breed

Yes, but not often.

It should be dynamike or mortis

I played 5 gem grab matches...lost 4 because teamates either didnt retreat or didnt push.

One time for half the match this dude just stayed in the base....doing nothing but shooting the wall üò≠
---
Typical brawl stars.
---
Bush campers everywhere you go along tamers.
---
Ok!
---
Rescue ranger
---
Nice
---
Why not?  I think more ranks will be great. That way tryhards can stop complaining about how easy rank 20 is and get a challenge they want.
---
Hooh
---
...or just get the Brawler to 300, you get Star Points then.

Hi

Better yet. Her turret with shocky

         Maybe You Guys (Mods or The Actual Dev Team) Can Make a Pole With Ideas That You Think Are Top Priority And Let Us Vote Which One You Should Try And Implement In The Game First.

I hate this song, it reminds me of school

Very nice! Good job.

What the fu-

I brought that for 119 gems after that it got on sale for 69. I feel bad for this.

I bought ot for 30 gems

exactly. its supposed to be endgame content.
---
September 2017. Removed in the update after.

Star Points are endgame content. Just push to 500, its not hard.

Would realy like to win :-P

We kinda already have go kart carl road rage carl

Stranger things is amazing, I just finished it yesterday

Tip: watch with sound

Just open 100 boxes.

He's pretty good as an anti-boss tho, depends on if you're willing to take the risk

what about it?

By the rate I am getting them they should be 5k

what if you are a dynamike who autoaims

The best idea

when you need to push 100 trophies to reach rank 20 but the lag says no

Update comes and big box and mega in shop...

Cool so your brain is basically a weather forecast

 I don't know why the crow was so brave to charge into elprimo like this
---
It‚Äôs the map. Even before band aid, 4-6 Shelly‚Äôs was the norm. She just didn‚Äôt have the win rate that she has now. 
---
And I‚Äôm not going to do it with cavern because I know full well the outcome will be vastly different. You‚Äôll get bulls, bos, Ricos, and throwers who win. If anything, it‚Äôs gonna tilt towards 5-8 throwers per game. Easy map to push throwers on.

Its notin cycle

Ok
---
Bacn in my days, getting to play a game was the reward.
---
I mean, you said you let him have them because Colt has lower health. So you let him have them.
---
Next time, notice that Colt‚Äôs range is much longer than Primo‚Äôs, so you can help out more when you have more gems. Plus, every meme here is about Primos suiciding with gems, should probably known better.
---
Also, my comment is over a month old.

Guys, I'm shaking. I'm fucking shaking. I never wanted to breed with anyone more than I want to with Scrappy. That perfect, curvy body. Those bountiful breasts. The child bearing hips of a literal godess. It honestly fucking hurts knowing that I'll never mate with her, pass my genes through her, and have her birth a set of perfect offspring. I'd do fucking anything for the chance to get Scrappy pregnant. A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that I can't is quite honestly too much to fucking bear. Why would Supercell create something so perfect? To fucking tantalize us? Fucking laugh in our faces?! Honestly guys, I just fucking can't anymore. Fuck.
---
THAT BEAR IS SO CUTE
---
Was thinking the same thing il make the changes
---
&gt;Is not YOUR ideea
---

I know but I would like to skin the skin and so please give a like house see supercell

Okay okay everybody calm down now.

You bring me up, you bring me a...

Ever seen the gold skin for Bo?
---
 Ever notice the price tag on gold skin for Bo? 
---
50,000 star points
---
Ever researched how the star point system is setup?
---
Rank 10      100 pts
---
Rank 15.     200 pts
---
Rank 20.     300 pts
---
Total star points per Brawler: 600 pts
---
Total number of Brawler's in game currently:
---
27
---
Total amount of star points earned from 27 rank 20 Brawler's: 16,200
---
How many star points short of 50,000 :
---
33,800
---
How can you earn the remainder points to purchase gold bo suit: play every Brawler's past 500 only to receive 50 percent of any points over 500 
---
Just this sound fair or balanced to you ?
---
I calculated how long it would take me to save up for that skin if I held all points... The math said 3 years
---
Hahahaaaa
---
So I bought the white mech skin for 10 k and said nevermind, it's just a different color scheme with the exact same features.
---
Yes, and read up I just went into a few details as to why. 
---
Thanks
---
Mike has higher dps than barley tho, people play barley over mike because of control
---
Nope!
---
It's beginning , middle, or end game.

Do you even know how the star points are awarded?

Why would you pay anything on a free game ? That's just stupid, unless you get some value back if you're a youtuber for example.

nice! i want leon... i already have crow and spike so i should not be so greedy lol

I absolutly love the design, really creative. I think the majority of brawlers could do well on this map. Brawl stars plz add this!!

That's the best and cute fanart I've ever seen.
---
What map is that?
---
Them boobs tho
---
Omg guys I‚Äôm shaking
---
Poco is one of the zombies...?
---
Well, gene along with Tara have supers that punish you for missing them. If you reward the player even with missing, it‚Äôs a free advantage
---
I always take screenshot when i unlock a bralwer but yeah this one was a little faster
---
Oh wait, you're right.

Not worth it for that little of a discount.

I'm too good!!!

It's not very common to get super after super in 3v3 or sd,it's very occasional

Oh boi here we go with the copy-paste thing
---
Guys I‚Äôm shaking
---
Wow! This is amazing!!! You never fail to amaze us
---
I wouldn't recomend this tho, up to power 6 he will be underpowered against tanks and you'll find yourself getting clapped by a tank with a 100 health left
---
nope
---
You have completely wronged this innocent child
---
OwO
---
No, one of the zombie killing team
---
Invisible man leon is awesome and go kart Carl too love them all
---
what I see is all crap but no player tag
---
FYI, getting over 500 means nothing, you are still trash
---
In showdown it‚Äôs very common especially against high health characters like bull,primo and Pam.

To your repost..." Sub"

You now have a a sub

Get it now ?

Heheeee

This is so cool! It's an amazing pice of fanart. I love it!

Hi, could I use your clip in one of my Brawl Stars compilation videos? Please tell me how you want to be credited. This is my YT channel:  [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChW0OK1LCv-36OFQf0t2MEQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChW0OK1LCv-36OFQf0t2MEQ)
---
Awww
---
Idk, 200 hp per second since the start of the match to the end of the match seems pretty op to me. At least Pam needs to charge her turret and the turret is easier to kill than gene, who can actually fight back.
---
repost
---
A trading system would be nice
---
I salute to you for you kindness
---
Good sir!
---
Yes you can and you can just normally credit me :)
---
Idk
---
top 10 photos taken before disaster
---
So cute, and emotional as well
---
It feels nice c':
---
I didn‚Äôt say I could, but just because I can or can‚Äôt doesn‚Äôt make this any more cool or interesting. It‚Äôs still mundane and regular.
---
I‚Äôm trying to disagree with his posts respectfully. How about you do the same instead of instantly going to ‚Äúyour bad‚Äù
---
Me: gets Gene and Darryl on the same day out of normal boxes
---
On 2 diff accounts...
---
It's true though...
---
I know you from the dnd doodles and comics, love your work, nice to know you also play bs!

it doesn't matter. What matter is , you don't even have a brawler above 800. To me, you are just a piece of trash, and the worst part is, you are a unrecyclable garbage.
---
this will be my new laptop wallpaper thanks
---
They ask for Twitter
---
u/Ryan_Supercell see this
---
Poco : i got you homie
---
i checked his profile can you pass me the bleach
---
Bruce is having none of that
---
Seriously, 
---
What's the need to repost?
---
Omg...thats...umm what should I say...
---
Lol you're right. While their post was short, pics can be attractive and easily digestible.
---
I don't get the chance to do that because i get two shotted before landing the second shot
---
I think he lacks more stun at his ulti so that he is well
---
Scrappy looks like a beastality
---
It‚Äôs called a meme.
---
You are underestimate power of a nibba?
---
Noice
---
No Its just unluckiness, like getting a brawler
---
It MIGHT be 1% chance of getting in the shop, dunno, Im guessing 
---
But SUPERCELL is not that money whoring and greedy
---
A buff isn't a rework. I admit the current ability sucks. Buffing it would only make it OP. it needs a total make over.
---
Also the "upvote so supercell can see" is pathetic. Can you list down the number of posts begging for upvotes in which SC actually listens? Probably zero.
---
Love this subreddit maybe add which would be a good comp for maps and modes
---
Seriously,I should have a buff
---
A bit stricter rules about Memes/Artwork. Also maybe a megathread for ideas and suggestions.
---
If he quits the game he will not get the trophies
---

Well, everyone was a noob once, the problem is not with the player but the matchmaking
---
That‚Äôs not how this meme is intended
---
This is so good! I m not a Nita fan,but damn she s so good!
---
How do you guys get these nicknames With Bralw lers?
---
I really love your artworks, do you have any social media besides of reddit?
---
Ah Yes My Favorite Skin, "Just a recolor
---
If that was an insult I‚Äôm at 8.k

The thing that lets some at 1k trophies have all 3 legendaries,  and others at 13k have none
---
Interesting
---
gene: dont you fucking spin on me crow
---
Why is everyone assuming Pam is Penny's mother too? Don't tell me it's because Penny and Jessie both build things in game, that's stupid.
---
It's weird that you're older than me in Reddit And i have more Karma Than Yours.

Guess what you didn't have an idea and you saw my shit now you are all on here like what ...a fucking crying little girl just ranting to me about what
---
You don't even know anymore
---
I feel.bad for.you
---
You like punishing yourself
---
Wondering why
---
Says the one who screams LET'S GO GET EM!!!! In a Spanish accent.
---
The way you make yourself a fool is funny. Not your words, but you... the fool. Don‚Äôt get it confused little one.
---
G e r l
---
Oh and now you need attention from others to validate your writings...how cute
---
Just like I said 
---
Your nothing but a bitch ass
---
Should have deep fried, otherwise, quality content. Eat my upvote
---
Idea:  Disallow extremely low effort stuff.  "Stop tHe SPIn" and similar are getting pretty annoying.  If someone has legitimate ideas, great; if they're just reposting the same old jokes, that gets tiring.
---
I like it
---
Using thiccochet rn
---
The world is going to end John.
---
Hmmm guess the ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù is deleting shit for you because like I said before, it‚Äôs all coming out of your ass. Maybe then we don‚Äôt have to see this little boy complaining that he‚Äôs not getting his star points.... awwww I almost feel bad.
---
No
---
Ah thats hot
---
My pennis
---
spam
---
Improve the content quality. Too much meme and shitpost make this all semi-useless.
---
You are literally the same type of idiot me and the guys were talking shit about last week
---
You have all this mouth and no action
---
You can talk a big fucking game and cannot back it the fuck up
---
That's on you little man
---
Don't have to front for me I could care less
---
Either way I can see right through your bullshit
---
Everybody jokes about these but its important that you buy those, getting to max power points on a brawler increases your chance of getting power points on other brawlers.
---
And it used to be so that you would get more gold but I think they reduced that since I dont seem to get 100-200 gold from boxes anymore
---
So am I 18 or 12? Make up your mind, you‚Äôre not making sense. Even with your ‚Äú$400‚Äù you can‚Äôt play well enough to get star points, what a loser.
---
I have only 1 question........WHY YOU DELETED THAT GMAIL ACCOUNT CONNECTED TO YOUR SUPERCELL ID!?!??!?!??
---
A man with quality
---
Ricochet&gt;thicochet
---
Leon would be the one who spends his time on the brawl star P subreddit
---
One of the best reddit Post ever.
---
PAMMDDOOOZZZZEEEERRRR!!!!!!!!!
---
Still a fool you can't catch a break...let's think about this
---
Your still writing carefully...why because you have nothing to actually input into this pointless conversation
---
So explain your energy to continue 
---
Only one reason
---
You plan to have the last word
---
That's it
---
You enjoy arguing
---
I see a little more of you 
---
This is too funny
---
Totally not from lwarb
---
Can you write properly? Each sentence gets shorter and less built than the last. Is your brain shutting down as you write this? I thought you were young but maybe you‚Äôre just stupid. Guess you forgot the part where you rated entire paragraphs... or are you so stupid you forgot?
---
üò≠üò≠üò≠ I forgot this Gmail connected with My Supercell Account
---
This is what a box in duo sd sees
---
Oooor they were just too afraid to attack you... they thought "this is too easy, must be a trap somehow".. :)
---
Not a complaint you stupid fuck it is an idea
---
Figure it out
---
Do u mean.............GENE-ios?? :D
---
Oooooh I‚Äôm a bitch ass. At least I‚Äôll never beg for star points lol go ask for more gem money, go go go!
---
Says tje dude teaming
---
Post on cory subredittüòÇüòÇ
---
Nah fam, in solo SD, you always gets your trophies
---
That one shelly with level 9 shelly must feel bad.
---
Why are you too so mad, I just wanted to say a joke
---
In solo SD, you always get your trophies
---
&gt;You have all this mouth and no action
---
Says the ‚Äúguy‚Äù arguing on a game subreddit
---
I hope you get a legendary soon
---
And by close you mean on the other side of the map lol
---
Welp ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
r/theydidthemath
---
People give these deals slack but its good that you buy them since that will give you max powerpoints, and in boxes you have more chances of getting powerpoints for other brawlers.
---
Well they‚Äôve already added the 30% damage reduction shield star powers to Bibi, Darryl, Carl and Bull. So adding a DOT to Gene or a little squeeze helps. Often he can‚Äôt three shot mid tanks but with a little squeeze that would be possible. 
---
Destructive power has a lot game changing elements. Bull will often use his super to clear space on certain maps. 
---
Healing himself with his super is just plain dumb. We can agree to disagree. I‚Äôll be shocked if Supercell don‚Äôt rework it entirely.
---
wy not poco?
---
pp hard
---
In case you
---
didn‚Äôt see
---
I‚Äôm not arguing
---
Just being
---
Entertained
---
By your stupidity
---
Guess that‚Äôs all I 
---
See from you
---
Stupidity.
---
This is even funnier.
---
I had to write in your format so you could understand. Guess complete sentences weren‚Äôt taught to you lol
---
Hmmmm
---
This better make it into the final film, I haven't seen a better version of this frame anywhere else
---
Maybe
---
ngl this did make me kinda happy
---
Double Mike's are the worst for me
---
I see them often and I don't even fight it anymore
---
Hahaaaa
---
Image size doesn't appear to be correct :( But I still like this art nonetheless :)
---
**loads super and band aid** default skin sucks and Bandita is the best
---
This is like that one time I beat a 50 trophy star power Carl when I was a noob (on gem grab lol)
---
Ouchy hahaaaa
---
is this a friendly game? because replays unlock after 400 trophies and you can't see other players name after 300, so
---
yes it will simplify the game
---
We need more discussion around balancing brawlers, more megathreads about new brawlers (or starpowers) i feel like this can not only help out the subredditit but the game also more discussion is always good
---
Shadowing is brilliantly used. Truly *well-done* in my opinion :)
---
I have purchased 5 as a minimum of power points
---
But WOW! I never thought it could get down to literally 1
---
THAT'S NUTS
---
If she has her super
---
It is me Vs 2
---
Can we get an F in the chat for people who watched the clip to the end? (I did)
---
Your art style is the complete opposite of what you mentioned :)
---
Would help a lot
---
You've got potential, especially for this being your first digital piece of art. I like it :)
---
Damn...Jesse is SOOOO HOT.
---
Lol!!!
---
Ending the game by shooting the ball at your own goal and scoring right before the game ends, making you go into overtime and losing the match (random on my team did this twice today &gt;.&gt;)
---
Ah bruh that's not how u use this meme template [https://www.reddit.com/r/shittybrawlstars/comments/cskgwa/that\_is\_not\_how\_you\_use\_that\_template/](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittybrawlstars/comments/cskgwa/that_is_not_how_you_use_that_template/)

They better use this frame, it is **mad-good**!!

He's mortis not Lucifer , damn

Leon pre-nerf was better imo

If this frame doesn't get selected I dunno what will. Good luck to you my good artist :)

I don‚Äôt want Leon I want Bibi
---
morper
---
It might not be good like other Brawl. Exe videos, but it looks like you put a lot of effort into it so I like it.
---
Honestly out of every single submission I've seen throughout this competition yours is by far the most creative. Absolutely LOVE this :D
---
There was a mistake fam....Accidently u put the Default skin Shelly on the "Shelly after the new update" part, which is where Bandita Shelly needs to be
---
Big hips
---
Lwarb edition
---
*everyone disliked that*
---
I can feel the ground shaking...

Actually piper is good on brawl ball....if she has snappy sniping
---
That's no reason to downvote
---
What does shelly love
---
(Shows everyone)
---
And super
---
Definitely not
---
When I saw the username IcyTamTam, I was already expecting something great. But *this* is **magnificent** :D
---
Not so hard. Poco is too god, I got him to 700
---
You choosed the best frame
---
Not bad

Thank you so much !

Chill out

Cool but....what about her super?!
---
Not bad at all, have my upvote!

Ha! Best revenge ever! Ppl that spin when someone else kills you/the guy that killed u spin after he killed u should go to hell!

*You are a good man. Thank you

How a brawler sees Bibi after getting whacked by Mr Bat

Death#230 Diavolo plays brawl stars and hes fighting pros

Why are you doing this?

This is insanely good. I just wish you did you artwork digitally :(

No ofc not but spreading it isnt a bad idea

Welcome to my world where the other team always are lv10

That's the point üòÇ

I can't wait for scrappy to pull his dick out and fuck jess so fucking hard my god
---
Free trophies win win
---
My suggestion would be just a higher standard of content. Less low-effort stuff. Maybe day of the week topic threads stickied to the top each day. Like Rant Fridays, newbie question Sunday threads etc...
---

Why am i looking at this

Blahblah blablah, it must have passed you by

You scared md, i thought you deleted brawl stars

well i think thats untill legendaries are as rare as packing legendaries in CR
---
Like your use of green :) It's my favorite color
---
Hell yeah
---
Has anyone seen my hat...?
---
Just give everyone the a band aid lmao
---
Woah you've legit got an art style like no other :D
---
How did you play robo rumble
---
Suggestion: Please, please stop with the "I'm shaking" whenever someone posts a fan art of a female toon from the game. It's pretty cringey at this point.   
---
Also would be cool to see a higher interest in user-submitted map ideas and game suggestions.
---
Better late than never :)
---
Wow... Where did Jessie and scrappy go? Were they apart of WWV?
---
All the Bibi fans would totally *love* this. I just wish this got more recognition :(
---
Oh, bro, thank you so much!
---
Frick zombie mode i wanna see mvm but im really confused to how the robot brawlers are gonna work. For ppl who dont know what mvm is its a tf2 mode and u fight the classes u can play but they are all robots instead of human. Just look it up
---
No. Definitely not
---
This is just cruel and unusual punishment
---
You definitely put effort into this! Good luck for being selected buddy :)
---
I bet the song sounds *Lit*.
---
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY FRAME
---
Simple, clean and amazing. Everything this post is :)
---
Def not
---
Thanks,dude)
---
xD also how many do you have? Im currently at 11k, with all brawlers except crow and spike.
---
Love the lighting effect you used :D
---
You definitely deserved that silver :) Now for the final film, good luck!

---
No its lucas

Oh
---
I AM A CREATURE OF THE NIGHT
---
Took me a while to spot Bibi XD But I still like the art style you used :)
---
The color could be based off elixir; either purple or black.
---
INTO THE FIRE
---
Doublers for sure
---
Thought Dakota because his name is like yours
---
Why even ask such a stupid question?
---
Has that Retropolis vibe, I'll give you that :) Good luck!

Good luck! I love it!!

More reasons why coiled snake is op
---
It‚Äôs not stupid. I had the same question 9 months ago.
---
Clearly yes
---
Both of them are trash cans on wheels. Shelly without bandaid was the worst brawler in the game.
---
For making a smart decision?

Unleashing her inner DBZ

I found nita easy but oh god is pushing tick to 500 one hell of a ride for a person like me who plays only SD
---
How does that make it any less stupid? Obviously 9 boxes for 29 gems is better than 10 for 49.
---
Ok, everyone hates me, then I'm gonna delete it then, haters

Primos get more karma when they do something helpful.
---
Wasn't sure if the brawler drop rate was higher or not in the mega box
---
Neon Bibi deserves to be in the final film :)
---
Thats amazing! All i need to rank up to rank 20 is tick.. but i still dont have all the mythics.. but i have all the legendaries.. yes ik its weird
---
not really, 
---
900 tokens=&gt; 9 boxes
---
900 tokens x2 =&gt; 18 boxes
---
so if you waste all of the doublers you'll end up with 18 boxes.
---
Oops üòÇ
---
I want to see more official post about the story behind the screen like what the clash royale subreddit usually does.
---
new boxes probably?
---

I wish they made a Bibi skin like this. 10/10 for creativity :)
---
Zochem me eto zdes pishem?
---
Reminds me of that time where a jessie saved me when it was 3 seconds left in gem grab. Sad day.
---
Yes, she needs a buff. Ofc band aid needs a nerf, but Shelly herself needs a huge buff cuz without the broken band aid she'll by far the worst brawler and don't say "ShE's Op AnYwAy" cuz if u don't know how to handle a Shelly by NOT GETTING CLOSE TO HER AND CHECKING BUSHES it's not everyone's problem
---
That Jessie tho omg
---
This actually looks good
---
More like wait until there‚Äôs 1 second left for you to  respawn to take them all
---
Personally I struggle with poco, so this is a decent accomplishment for me
---
Yeah gotcha but even ƒ∞f don't buy the tokens ƒ∞'ll either way getting those 9 boxes haha
---
Waluigi waaaaa
---
I'm... Wait... I'm robot lol XD
---
Pocos hard for me so I take satisfaction in getting to 500
---
We love an original concept, and this surely deserved that 100 upvotes :)
---
At least this skin has a hat
---
Better make a run for it! XD

Totally agree :D

There has been 2-4 games where i get matched up against players that stay in spawn, no they're not afk they keep tapping attacks in one while at spawn. And they go unpunished for it.

Your lighting and shadowing effects really payed off in this piece of artwork. Love it :)

Community Awards for the sub (I am also independently working on designing some that would hopefully be a good fit) so that you can give more than the generic awards of Silver, Gold and Platinum.
---
Examples:
---
 - A video award to give to someone who posted a very good video or replay
---
 - A picture award for high quality art work
---
 - A picture award of something done in game that is worthy
---
 - An OC award for things that so good they deserve extra distinction
---
Just some ideas so far, let me know if you have others :)

So true or follow you to the bush when you are in duo and only opticion is to sneak to other bush

I'm too lazy to find right now. Just go on Frank's Twitter. If you're patient you will see he confirmed that in answer for people talking about the Star Shop.
---
He said that we would get "non-cosmetic" items.
---
*genes * star power
---
You don‚Äôt have to feel ashamed lol. I like your idea, but I think mine just makes a little more sense
---
Adorable
---
Thank you the only brawler I need is crow and the thing is I somehow managed to get two legendaries and yet crow is my favorite one and the only brawler I won't have but I still love my account.

not really, if money was their first priority season rewards woudnt have been a thing

Yeah, I get what you mean but at the same time it wasnt really the greatest way to make people play. As you said, you could just wait 14 days and get 7 boxes, theres not a lot of encouragement to push, this is why I believe they changed the system but I dont think making it so theres no progression is the right way, thats why they'll be adding "non cosmetic items" to the Star Shop

duuude fr i played leon on bounty a bunch recently and literally i always had a piper or something that would like follow me around when i was invisible and i got hit bc of them it was so annoying
---
Where are Golden Barley and Loaded Rico?
---
Yup! And we know that the teammate means well.. but it sometimes hurts the "come out of nowhere with the clutch gank" playstyle
---
Playing Primo and calling it skill

#removeshelly üòÇ

Well, this is from coiled snake.
---
I knew this post from your new one
---
The point is YOU ARE LUCKY
---
Wait that is illegal
---
I know lol
---
When you are that 3k player who has a legendary but now Im 7.2k
---
They see me rollin, they hatin
---
Yo what's with his eyes I just noticed
---
Next up : Gorl
---
Yes i know, this meme is bad but i want it
---
Yeah i like to 2 star points every season
---
Looks like a map thst could actually be in game
---
# PRIMO TO THE RESCUE
---
I have all the leggies but not the mythics.
---
I have spike both star powers tho and i actually gemmed leon
---
But nothing else
---
Gl on getting crow tho. Hes really good
---
But my personal fav is spike and leon is 2nd
---
But dont get me wrong crow is insane
---
Well, maybe a weekly or monthly post from the developers so we can share more ideas, fan arts, maps, Brawlers, skins, etc. That would be awesome so you can get more ideas for the game and also share some time with the community.
---
update: I made the parameters and im about to color it / texture paint it. I think i'll be able to finish it tomorrow. (i'm doing it in 3d btw)
---
Happy happy cake day
---
Personally I love her... But everybody says that she is very very bad
---
(she needs buff)
---
I'd be pissed off if I were the rosa
---
The Big Box ist too expensive/the 400 Coins are too cheap. I am maxed out and I am only getting like 100-200 coins per big box.
---
Wait you aren't a mod
---
But what I really loved the most is that u put the 2018 Shelly on the "before update" part and the 2019 Shelly on the "after update" part lol
---
Cuz gene ugg
---
I do that when I had to team and showdown when the other guy hadn‚Äôt teamed I let him win
---
480 upvotes and only 12 comments hmmmm
---
Lmao
---
This is just a concept and the prices dont have to be this way. Also, the coins arent really for maxed out players but for people that well, need coins, I imagine that if something like this was added it would also be "filtered" in a way so maxed players dont get this offer often or not at all, or at least thats how I'd do it
---
Scrappy is B E E F Y
---
Yeah I was going for that because I like those aesthetic 90s styles! You could probably see that in my banner and profile pic color style!
---
YET AGAIN MORTI ATTACK THE FELLOW COMRADES.. RICO ARMY, UNLEASH THE SUPERS!
---
I already saw this, you can‚Äôt fool me
---
Thank ya!
---
It's a pretty good concept!
---
Thanks random stranger for caring about others strangers even through that isn't your job (I would give you a medal but Im poor)
---
Really nice
---
If they were going to add it, it would look different from yours that you would most likely recommend
---
Probability man. If there is a 1% to get star power in shop, odds are 1/100. To get three at one time = (1/100)*(1/100)*(1/100) = 1/300 = 0.0033
---
Pay attention in school kids!
---
# Carl: THE ROCKS SPEAKS TO ME NOT THE GADGETS.
---
poco gaaaaaaaannnng!!
---
Hey so yes we all definitely know how the star point system works and thanks for reminding everyone.
---
This was a post about my idea for a way to earn extra star points.
---
Some items only purchasable through star coin cost upwards of 50,000 
---
You couldn't afford that item even if you maxed out 27 Brawler's to rank 20 
---
It wouldn't cover the amount needed.
---
But thanks for stopping in.
---
So that's why I didn't recognize the map... :)
---
He is going over 9000 !
---
She does need a little buff
---
For this map:
---
S tier shelly bull rosa
---
A tier bibi brock penny crow darryl
---
B tier pam leon nita spike
---
So teaming?
---
Doesn't matter I should be getting 800s in my matches. I still don't see how the 500s got into my match. Like I'm willing to wait longer if there r very little 800s around. Rather wait and have good teamates than be matched up with noobs
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be 1/100 per spot? 1/100 + 1/100 6 times would be 6/100. So 6/100 x 5/100 x 4/100 or .06 x .05 x .04 = .000012 or .0012%? It‚Äôs been a minute since I took a stats class so that could be wrong.
---
We, ricos are very high tech
---
Sure
---
pffffft.. yknow its fun, right?
---
thanks for the note.  I appreciate it!

I feel like some problems still remain, like the chokepoints in the middle. Try opening it up a bit, you usually dont want to have "restricted" paths or they will get spammed a lot and slow the game down. Also, try making the walls surrounding the safe and the fences a little bit shorter, they are also very thrower friendly and you usually dont want to promote one type of Brawler, especially one thats annoying. And check this post out https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlmaps/comments/btrn6j/if_you_want_some_tips_on_mapmaking_for_specific/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share here you can find some pretty good tips covering every game mode you'd want to make a map on, and I also made a video covering general stuff about maps and what you should keep in mind when making one https://youtu.be/DFQHkcKKFRs

WOW I WILL SAVE THAT!

Removed. Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. Additionally do not use low effort/all caps/clickbait titles.
---
Penny here, dont fear to much, penny: i dont want you anymore! Me: ahhhhhhhh! *running away*
---
The big box is actually super cheap, I know OP just made it as an example, but if they ever did this and that‚Äôs a HUGE IF, it would be more like 30k+, think about it.. they barely give out gems in boxes and they want people to spend money which is why they won‚Äôt do it, but it would have to be a ridiculous amount..
---
Me did it with out coiled Snake, me dies and Shelly don't kill them but run away
---
RANDOMS
---
Thank you. Tara is my personal favorite brawler but I have wanted crow ever sense I saw the advertisement for brawl stars and LOTS OF GOOD LUCK! On getting those mythics.
---
Anyways glad that i got to unlock a mythical ,can finally write it off from list of mythical &amp; legendary left to unlock
---
Trash prices bro
---
OMG YOUR THE ONLY PERSON THAT HAS SHELLY OMG AAAAAAAA
---
Flair doesn‚Äôt check out
---
or by anything with enough luck, making his mines go all around you
---
Mortis is not a fighter, he is  creature of the night
---
Really bad quality
---
Ughhhh XD u know what I meant... and ultfiresword I understand why u hate band aid I also hate it it's broken and makes almost every game on maps like Eye of the Storm and Cavern Churn to be 10/10 Shellys, which sucks and that's why everyone hate these maps, but sometimes doesn't look like u hate band aid, it more looks like u hate Shelly herself, he chose to bushcamp and use band aid (sadly, band aid Shellys are kinda 97% of the Shellys so bruh) but other Shellys choose real strategies
---
U know what think whatever u want I don't care what u will reply I know very well that band aid is broken, no one loves bushcampers and everyone hate SHELLY cuz most of the players choose to bushcamp and use star power that makes ppl uninstall the game so think whatever u want, i'm not a "change my mind" sign
---
Challenge: take a shot every time someone mentions the prices
---
T I D D I E S
---
Lmao I would be so pissed.  I want Meteor Rush so bad.
---
Piper is and mortis is cool bo is sexy
---
Can you send me the dynamite pls?
---
Now I‚Äôm scared to read the comments. Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if a lotta ppl mentioned it lmao. I just comment and move on.
---
It‚Äôs not called teaming. It‚Äôs called fair competition.
---
oh shit whats up rtil i havent seen you in a long time
---
I understand, gg for this üòÇ
---
oh boy you're in for a treat
---
*xxxtentacion-orlando starts to plays*
---
Actually no
---
Slow reaction time lol
---
I'm at 12k without Frank &amp; all legendaries
---
repost dude
---
I didnt do it dont worry
---
U can't super chain me without me using my super on u so HA! FeEl ThE pOwEr Of BlAcK hAiR aNd EyE pAtCh!
---
But he used up all his luck, right?
---
In fact, I calculated it incorrectly the first time. They‚Äôre actually even worse odds. 
---
The odds of someone getting a 1% event three times is actually 0.0001%. 
---
(1/100)*(1/100)*(1/100) = 0.000001 = 0.0001%
---
I LOVE TICK
---
Sure feels like it when I‚Äôm trying to run from her.
---
Should've replaced "Gem carrier dies" with "EEEEL PRIMOOOO"
---
Im 9.5k without piper and im not crying
---
tick needs a high skill and star points will be useful next update but i agree on gene's star power it's useless when you only use his super to pull enemies and lastly eye of the storm is a good map you only need to be away from those long bushes on the sides
---
So cool! So cool! So cool! So cool!
---
This...does put a smile on my face
---
Looks like frankenberry from the cereal box 
---
Hahahaaa
---
piper next would be nice imo, loved it!
---
Bibi using leon should be the star player cuz he is controlling leon using bibi, then leon using bibi should be controlling leon
---
So you‚Äôre guaranteed a good amount of power points, it‚Äôd really help with progression for players that don‚Äôt want 4 power points for 2 brawlers and 12 coins from a normal brawl box
---
Yeah, this is big brain time
---
His profile is a minefield
---
I was thinking about that actually. I did it in my next edit ;)
---
Involved
---
Why?
---
Someone send me here, and i'm not shaking this time
---
nice video editing
---
It looks very cool
---
Same
---
Supercell added the last Brock skin much before band aid was released, and they're on a vacation, but cool artwork so I upvote
---
Primo: is there a option to use super?
---
Alchemist is the best
---
Right? If anything, Poco would be the BEST choice in a zombie apocalypse. He'd have full immunity!
---
Push Tick in bounty or brawl ball. I got him to 500 in a bit less than 2 hours, starting with him being around 250 trophies. Check out 'Dr. mmm' on YouTube, he gave some sweet tips on how and where to push Tick. (and other brawlers, too)
---
Oh hi lowme. These are great ideas, I would love to see some actual loot added to the star shop. I have saved 15K of the points in case they were to do it.
---
r/shittybrawlstars
---
Scrappy with 2nd star power.
---
I‚Äôm playing showdown, and I‚Äôm going for the win. I see a couple brawlers who are doing the spin. I only spinning that I wanna see, is a legendary on the unlock screen.
---
Now it's time to NK to pierce you with his spear.
---
power 1 near
---
reaching 500 is easy now but it's still hard to push over it
---
Geez!!!! I'm really curious to know how it will work XD
---
He didn't even make it, but okay
---
Well I did that and finished top 1 or top 2 in 10 out of 15 matches on average.
---
Obviously it's not only bush camping. You have to stand your ground and not let enemies make you fall back. The only way to die is an enemy rushing you with energy drink, when you don't have your super, or 2 teams pinching you. Other cases, it's almost top2 guaranteed.
---
Xd
---
So
---
Thanks.
---
oh. didnt know that
---
whats that on the bush? a crow?
---
Bull
---
Feel The Power Of DEATH
---
Sorry that is my luck to make everyone arpund me salty (I mever asked for legendarys)
---
When Phoenix Crow defeats Gold Mecha Crow and steals his power.
---
If the Brock went already off the game then he wouldn‚Äôt get trophies
---
*Angery creature of the night noises*
---
makes sense
---
heist with a gem grab style looks interesting
---
I though I was safe of hat supremacists outside of r/MortisGang , but I was wrong.
---
Indeed. You got any as a Shelly?
---
Me too
---
Supercell ADD THIS
---
Carl would swallow this map
---
true
---
Why are you sending me this subreddit
---
they should give part of the prize in the game
---
Idea TICK : they should put a stellar ability where they become immune for 6 seconds since it is the one that has less life and is more used
---
Yeah but what if double Piper team with 10 power ups cornered me lol
---
Srsly what if a team with a huge amount of power ups is cornering me and i'm not really threating them? Any answer except "ur screwed up" is accepted!
---
press F ma boi
---
Yep, that's what I got too (assuming you can get any number of star powers on a given day). However, if there are x slots in the shop per day, the chance of getting y star powers (where y&lt;=x) would be:
---
x!*99^(x-y)/(y!*(x-y)!*100^x)
---
i.e. the binomial distribution (with some other assumptions as well).
---
Yeah and that‚Äôs what he meant with his comment yet you‚Äôre tryinh to argue with him when u have the same argument?
---
Oh yea that‚Äôs right, what about cheapest gem skin?
---
Had the same with spike but then trophy inflation happened and now I have 24 in 500
---
Because it‚Äôs shitty, the community complains about the same things and it gets annoying the 213 time
---
I think the scary part is, that the BS devs look at fanart regularly, and have probably seen a lot of NSFW content on BS Brawlers.
---
Poor Frank must be scared for life.
---
Totally
---
His is the opposite of mine and no one‚Äôs ‚Äútryin to argue lol
---
&gt;.&lt;
---
Here üëå have a blue vote

When there are 3 brawlers left and the 2 Pipers with 8 and 9 power cubes are teaming
---
AND IT'S DUNE DRIFT
---
Ok i just asked
---
  &gt;.&lt;
---
No, he just didnt want to kill him, he was giving him a chance to fight and not just lose trophies for whatever reason
---

Nah its porn

You know, I think that "I dont have a name for it yet. Could you help me out by naming it and giving suggestions for improvement. It's like a small feast or famine map in brawl ball." Would make it really come together. But seriously, it looks great. ¬Ø\_‡ºº ‚Ä¢ÃÅ Õú ñ ‚Ä¢ÃÄ ‡ºΩ_/¬Ø
---
I prefer the simplistic cartoony pictures we have now
---
Go Check out some YTer. Coach Corry and Kairos Time just made two really good tier lists. They show which brawler are strong right now and where. Don't watch the newest Tier list fron Kairos though. This is a high competetive Tier list for over 600 trophie brawler. Watch his last casual tier list
---
I agree with Manck, it‚Äôs random and prioritizes teamers as stated in the patch notes
---
Ty babe &lt;3

I got 17 the other day

That Shelly knows every single secret in brawl stars
---
double bo or double tick in a very walled map is my take
---
Me, 10000 trophies without piper: (Pathetic.png)
---
my crow is level 6 at 510 trophies decided to never touch him because i push him then tilt every time i play
---
mortis join the chat
---
I would use an army of Healing Shade Taras for the heals
---
You both think that attacking would have been smarter because then the meteor would have been more likely to target someone else, how is it the opposite?
---
Nice but if you go afk you don‚Äôt gain trophies
---
They were just garantee-ing a second place to get trophies they didn‚Äôt stand a chance against you
---
Stop the shilling of YouTube channels and art spams.
---
Isn‚Äôt that‚Äôs just horror movies?
---
Sorry, but I typed the same comment, because I came up with the same idea. I didn't steal it so please accept my apology.
---
I‚Äôve realized today that I‚Äôm missing more than 100 gems too. You should contact the support team, although hey haven‚Äôt been helpful at all in my case, they just said there were no recent transactions. I‚Äôm so disappointed...
---
I wish you good luck finding out what happened.
---
I expected that and im sorry. I don't check reddit so much and im in many other subreddits, i made the meme and then i discovered was already made, i accidentally reposted this other 2 times and in the last one i said in comments "I actually realized that they already did this, sorry". Im really sorry about this, it can happen.

I don‚Äôt mind the description, but that name is wrong for the description. Photosynthesis should be something more akin to enemy energy attacks heal her up or something like that.

i'm talking about players who spin after killing someone who isn't teaming or targeting them

I got more

Usual spot, the DMZ

YES

It's on their profile

No, you don't if you finish the game as a bot you gain 0 even if you're first. So many times have I won the game and at the very end my wifi stpos or the phone decides to switch to a different network and the bot comes for 0.0000000000001 seconds and it gives me 0 trophies.

Says the one who dresses like their ready for el dia dr Los muertos all year long.

Nice drawings though, very sweet

And for me, to reload Mr bat does that make sense ?

Wow!! great job!
---
Honestly I hope you are lying, there are people who haven't spent any star points for skins and now have 20k+ star points, resulting to 20+ mega boxes, which is 200+ brawl boxes for nothing, so if you don't know anything about how the game works, don't even bother talking.

It that instance, when the Gene super hits your teammate , it will heal them. The super will continue and hit the enemy and pull them through your teammate toward you.

Leave that shit! u didn't buy Bandita Shelly, which is x9999999 more important
---
You get 2 star points because as I saw in your profile you dont even have 7000 trophies. It's endgame content and noobs complaining about it shouldn't have any access to it so instead of complaining about it get yourself some trophies
