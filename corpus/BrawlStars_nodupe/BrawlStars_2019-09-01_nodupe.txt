Okay, let's make this clear. It is NOT a repost.

They can just not pay for it like I said the pass was a big improvement even if you dont intend to pay for it. It isnt exclusive for people that pay for it.

Pipers star power

how did he get it as gene?

Ahh I see your using ibis paint X.

It‚Äôs a bug in customs

Thanks, means a lot

Pipers star power- when she hits her target she reloads her next shot .4 times faster
---
(I‚Äôm pretty sure)
---
Aha hello
---
I stopped playing around the Mega Knight update so I can't really have a fair opinion on the Pass Royale. Looks ass but my opinion isn't valid since I haven't played the game when it was added.
---
Spend more gems get a better deal, just like how you spend more money you get more gems
---
Sure it's just 5$, but I don't want something in the back of my mind telling to spend 5$ every season just to have fun, I should be able to purchase stuff in the game whenever I want to, weather in days or years
---
Ok

Ikr. Just. Fuck. Off.

Its not. 
---
When autofire was introduced, it was named Autofire and when global update released, it renamed to Quickfire
---
Ppl just call it autoaim for sake of conveniency
---
I'm very well aware if this. But hes making it seem like he drew it when he did not
---
Honestly probably not since the game just got second star powers.  It wouldn‚Äôt expect another round of star powers in at least a few months
---
lets say you have 550 on a brawler, after the season ends, you lose half of the trophies above 500
---
Her super "effects" weren't touched
---
Me likey

Ray has one ammo bar with 3 shots that take 4sec to reload completely. When all of his ammo is full Ray fires an electric blast that stuns and deals high damage to enemies.
---
Stun:

At this fucking point,  need to know if people‚Äôs humor have literally degenerated to ‚Äúhaha el primo 10 gem funny‚Äù, ‚Äúdynamike=fidget spinner‚Äù, or just the fucking annoying ass 6969 post, that clutters the r/shittybrawlstars community.

Someone please tell me these people aren‚Äôt just conspirators that try to ironically post shit things and then woooosh me after I‚Äôve ranted about them.

YOU! You are the Player One! And 8-Bit is Player Two! People were saying this :T

that k piper
---
Yeah, I hate doing it. Whenever I do the classic ‚Äúteam kill at the front of the enemy goal‚Äù instead of spinning or just waiting I straight up walk it in
---
I recently hit 8k, so hopefully I get my first legy ;-;.  They‚Äôre the only brawlers I‚Äôm missing

They are calculating something

Bandaid is so bad in showdown if shelly have many powercube
---
I don‚Äôt like being  the big boi so I do that
---
I got leon from boxes on the ticketed events. Spend your gems on token doubles! You'll get one soon. But I feel your pain. My friend played for a week, and got spike and never played again.
---
star powers dont charge supers. its not stupid, its common sense
---
There‚Äôs  a lot more flexibility with maps, especially since Supercell puts community maps into the game.  Also, a lot of brawler concepts, would be completely unbalanced in the meta, or are just a combination of other brawlers.
---
You could‚Äôve run away
---
Spike will win.
---
They dont even pass they just own goal
---
Because in brawl stars Spike dps is high and stronger than Leon and crow don't hate please.
---
The damage from star powers should still charge your super in my opinion
---
What you mean?
---
It‚Äôs like Showdown and bounty combined.  This would actually probably be my favorite game mode
---
Well, if there are no walls to protect them üòÖ
---
Is 8-bit a girl?
---
On a food chain, the arrows show the movement of energy or food.
---
Go for dynamike because of Tick's super
---
But does that affect the Trophy ROAD??
---
i dont agree. simply cuz that's too much of an advantage for ppl who dont have sp.
---
On the contrary, I used to buy those all the time when I saved up enough but small boxes were never enough, I know the math says that 1000 tokens = 100 boxes, and 1 mega = 10 boxes, but I‚Äôve never unlocked anything that way. I decided to switch to megas and that‚Äôs how I got my limited brawlers, I guess megas get my luckier. I‚Äôve never bought a skin either, just used my gems on megas and tokens, but honestly I‚Äôll stick with megas because I seem to get a better chance there
---
Heavys at the top (shelly is trash without her damn starpower)
---
yeah

Try bitheroes, also very f2p

#yes please

Excuse me, you started playing before 2019 and still have 5k? You don't play often?

you will i promise he's very good i have him at 608 atm.

Smoll brain
---
I remember my boyfriend introducing me to brawlstars and when I was around 1k I opened a brawl box and got Leon. Let‚Äôs just say he got rlly pissed and shocked cause he had 3k at the time and didn‚Äôt have any legendaries and still doesn‚Äôt to this day. (We were on a voice call btw) Good job on getting your first legendary! I hear many ppl don‚Äôt get lucky with getting legendaries from brawl boxes so nice.
---
This is already mindblowing and you haven't even finished it yet
---
Yeah
---
Thx
---
UwU
---
Leon's super shouldnt lose the invisibility when he gets 4 tiles of an enemy. It should be 2 tiles and let Leon leaves footprints on ground. It would make people have attetion with Leon.
---
Jesus
---
It wasn‚Äôt worth responding too. You‚Äôre all 500. Just a oneshot Bibi
---
Trophy Road does not reset at all. Once the rewards are unlocked, they will never be unlockable again.
---
what a god
---
Chill lmao I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs just a 100 trophy diff he could‚Äôve just grinded that one brawler a lot I‚Äôm not saying I could beat him for sure or anything like that
---
well in most situations it's a waste
---
Ohh lord...
---
Well at least they did not die!
---
Ahh well the third one is the last one. I can't say he will have a speaking role but you will see
---
All you need is water
---
I know  but this post was supposed to be a joke
---
I'm pretty sure it rotates in the fourth slot for gamemodes, people didn't like it and they wanted permanent brawl ball, might be a while before they which it at all.
---
Thanks.

Ohh,the good old days

---
Nice repost, go find something original
---
Wow u are lucky
---
But seriously though, they need to fix the meteors.
---
I actually like this idea. It‚Äôll be sort of like clubs but on a global scale. They‚Äôre could even be challenges to do within them and some sort of ‚Äúglobal war‚Äù between all clubs where one club wins each season. Or even not brawler specific, but I theme specific. So, pirates, Arabic, wild western, robots etc.
---
this is the best offer you can get. legendaries are worth 700 gems which can be dropped down to 349 when on discount. this offer gives spike in 350 gems and skin in 109 so it's the best you can get. however if you want leon, you need to wait till shark leon is released. skin and leon both will be offered. leon skin will be cheaper too.
---
honest opinion - leon is very very weak since a while.it stays around 10 to 15 rank in all brawlers. spike on the other hand is always a top 5 brawler and there is very low chance of nerf. so you should be buying this offer you are planning to dump some money one the game.
---
Brawl Star's update took 3 weeks to make, cr's august update was a rushed update cobbled together in 2 days, leading to the only new content being a very bad skin and some simple emotes. That was the only way they were able to have "3 weeks per update" while also having a 1 month long vacation.
---
She had almost every advantage she needed, just a figure of speech.
---
Ok, I‚Äôm gonna try that soon
---
why do you think all dynas team, it's not about the brawler, it's about the player
---
yes i have a spike/sakura spike offer in my shop right now for 459 gems

This changed in the update they are reset to a tier tap on a 500 trophy brawler's trophies to see the tiers.

Just wait then.

It‚Äôs really bad that some players at 4k have like 24 or 25 brawlers and then people like you don‚Äôt get nothing

Good idea, can possibly replace invisiheal as a star power

I like the editing and these ideas for these star powers are very interesting. Good work!

That sounds fun

Alright, if you say so

I have the same problem and it's making the game unfun at this point

You‚Äôll get them eventually since they added mega boxes for star points it‚Äôs gonna be easier

also kinda tome wasting to not cut the piper kill which is 200% unrelated to basically the whole clip and title

While i respect their opinions, calling ppl names because they like something different is wrong

It's been two whole days and no quick fix. I thought the maintenance break would fix it but no. Hopefully when they nerf 8-bit in a few days they will add in a fix.

And even if your idea was in this post, let me tell you that I have seen other people suggest  a similar idea to yours.

Sure it is :)

That's why you learn strategy, dont waste all your ammo xd
---
yes.
---
I swear if your at 3k...
---
Thanks ;w;
---
yeah don't use up to much ammo and check always.
---
am i the only one laughing at the spike named ‚Äúpepe‚Äù
---
Really, you‚Äôre complaining about colt? It‚Äôs incredibly hard to hit his shots, and easy enough to juke. If you want a brawler to complain about, complain about crow. That motherfucker of a bird chases you down to no damn end, and can consistently land his shots with little to no effort. Not to mention his incredibly fast move speed which makes him impossible to escape or catch up to! He‚Äôs such a pain in the ass when you play showdown.
---
My comments are getting so sexual so fast lmao. This was not what I anticipated posting this. Regardless, thank you for thinking my art is nice :).

I spent 20 mins reviewing the play there is a three second gap where you see the Shelly entering the bush. The bull opened a box in the very beginning and that's how he knew the bull was there. The fact that the bull didn't kill him, that's just luck.  But I think he needs a better title

Whats up with them? Don't they work on weekends?

Ridiculous service and performance.
---
im shaking guys
---
If you were that high In trophies before the trophie changes,you should know that most of the pro players push in brawl ball,with teammates and team comp.Nobody cares if you don't like BB,brawl ball is one of the most fast modes to push.You can win the match in 30 sec if you play well,and since now you get trophies with the time played and not with skills,BB gives pros advantage to push,just like the old siege.And stop lying about 12k you have nothing

Noiceeeee dude

Of course I do. But when a beaker has already been needed into the ground supercell nerfs then again. Leon is only good in showdown, and even there he has one of the lowest winning percentages. You probably have played piper and get one bursted lmao. Every instant dmg char can unload all three shots extremely fast. You have to wait for every atk to finish animation with Leon. And his reload time is horrendous. If you don‚Äôt have Leon im gonna end the debate here bro.

Level 10 brawlers you have not unlocked? Bad idea.

That's true tbh. I rarely use Tick now because he takes away the fun from Brawl Stars (no skill required most of the time) so I only have impressions of him when he was first released and I played him abit. 
---
Brawl Stars is going the same way as Clash Royale. As the game ages, the devs add more characters that are easier to play and have way lower skill ceilings. This isn't adding variety; this is just being lazy. If this is the new content we are gonna get, I rather not have it at all. Give us Brawlers that require decent skills to play properly, like Jessie, Brock and Colt.

I don‚Äôt understand all this ‚Äòbrawl stars elite game‚Äô crap. Nobody cares what the best supercell game is, they‚Äôre all just outlets to make supercell money. Their other games got this much support when they were as new as brawl stars. Just go play your game of choice and stop making stupid memes about which one is a better way to pay supercell

Now where have I seen this before...

Just woke up

I had no idea it was so popular or why it is popular. It feels like one of the least skilful modes to me. I do ok on it, but it can too easily be ruined by a bad team mate or even worse one that sabotages the team with own goals.

Mate how does your level 8 Brock only have 283 trophies? Mini is level 6 and 600 trophies.
---
Same to me!
---
I've already written to Supercell a couple of time and they already know about this problem, they said their priority is to fix this issued along with the problems that make the game to crash.
---
The low fps is caused by the game that is not using all the phone capabilities since the update..
---
I play with CPU and GPU usage onscreen and since the update the game usage is much lower for both and this cause low frame rate...
---
Hope they will fix this soon, it's ruining my experience by a lot :(

Is that a JoJo reference?

Nah this is gonna be the new copy pasta I saw this 4 times already. First it was Pam then it was thicco than Pam again and now it's piper.

Look at yours teammate nick, it is easy to determine that a person is not doing well with life if he has a Russian nickname (in most cases I choose an internationally understandable nickname), and if he has a prefix in the nickname (–ë–õ–≠–¢). You're just out of luck. It's all.

you could include that in the graphic because more people can think its speed from walking only
---
U forgot the button on her hair
---
Gene looks like he's holding hands with sakura spike
---
i genuinely have no idea who thought this ship made sense but i won't judge, the comic's cute and well drawn
---
I wish the same. And also I wish there was an old skin for piper and dyna too xD
---
 Oh)))
---
I know it's out of context , but moderators delete the post if i say something against supercell . Fact is more than 30% of time , playing in duos with random , we end up with the player dead on arrival and instead of the player supercell bots take over and these rambos starightaway goto the battlefield and get martyred . WTF  Superhell do something about your servers
---
They should give trophies for draw in heist because its extremely hard to get
---
Me too but then I heard from my friends abt it too

Man i think you better need to also write to supercell from his support centre in-game!

Tell them you are facing worse experience since the update because of the low framerate and the frame drops.

So cute. Love the smol stuff.

No

nobody says it but Frank and Shelly are beyond cursed on heist
---
it's the unspoken rule, don't play Frank on heist
---
How
---
I had a goal like that too
---
when i got mortis i had like 1500-2000 trophies i was mad because of his range and i thought he was bad
---
that's because he selected solo showdown
---
I am playing since android beta but I haven't bought any of these skins because I only bought doublers. If these skins will come back, many players will buy them.
---
Even i change other events i still cant so i left and came back
---
Yes
---
Another 6 year old saying the developers are lazy,like what do you do with your life?Play on your tablet/phone for 20 hours straight?

I didn't get a single star power since june!!!

Ouuuuuch

Guess the shelly deserves to die

I love it that shelly and piper has to change their hair colours too ü§£

Nice idea!

Said the kiddo came from instagram to ruin reddit...
---
Yep
---
Lol jk nobody would actually be shaking... *sees piper's new icon* omg no
---
Dynamike eat dynamic cause he thought it is sausages
---
*laughs in Shelly*
---
Tfw you have your sound effects off
---
leon is capitalized but Crow not...WHY??
---
Lol nope, 8-bit already has above average health and damage to compensate for that. Nerf those things and buff his speed and maybe he'll still be balanced
---
Wall have skin too
---
Nice
---
Wait what's that thingamabob
---
The impprtant thing is where is the tokens rewarded?
---
Ps4 is better xd
---
Can you make Bibi x Crow? (by the way this is epic)
---
I did that for Snappy Sniping. 100% worth it
---
Idk man, i already got used to her new icon lol, i started liking it
---
i delete my posts by changing it from mobile to the pc website then deleting the post from my profile cause i don't have the app
---
Same, i waiting for leon skin and i have 110 gems and my hands are getting seriously itchy. i know this because i  accidentally bough 8-bits second skin.
---
Give as back ricochet
---
I guess you can see Leon's dick in Nita's clothes if you look closer
---
Awesome

Dynamike need luck to win mortis so no

I think the owner is u/sewalky

Correct me if I'm wrong.

Thats a shark

Yeah, I know

Thx, I‚Äôll make one
---
Same! I pushed him to 700 the first morning he was out and the competition was nothing! I won 40 solo showdown in a row lol so it only took me like 3 -1/2 hours to get him all the way up
---
Left dude was on a team with shelly
---
A holo skin would really fit Carl
---
u/10secondsmemes
---
In all fairness, opponent had 8-bit, so movement-wise it was an even game.
---
life right now hahaha
---
I love how everyone is making jokes about shaking when only 1 person actually commented the shaking copypasta
---
Cos he wakes for it instead of putting in stoopid codes
---
I will never understand this '-'
---
Welp, I Had Wan More Trophy To 300...
---
No its not :) i have posted this on other platforms, but this is the first time posting on reddit.
---
Yes... Kind of... Because he is tired and wants to sit so he is ok a desk..  so you can call him desktop 8-bit
---
You have one legy at 14670 don't tell me its crow and tou have the worst luck jesus christ
---
i am not confused tho XD
---
every old models are similiar to their "new" model, but rico is the only one that changed completely
---
Nope, very much not worth it unless you basically have every other star power in the game.
---
I had this happen to me yesterday
---
But the devs said that teaming is ok bc you don't Know if they will backstab you
---
It is stolen my dude. Its made by u/gedi-kor
---
aww I got crow from a small boxüòé
---
The worst part is, every single super plays the sound effect 4 times so it's even more annoying
---
Cute
---
Nibba You Can't fool us this is clearly an old Gedi-Kor Art
---
Its very bad. I can upgrade all my brawlers except for the 4 that have star powers (I have all of them) and I would NEVER buy gold for gems. (I am f2p) only thing i buy is tickets or token doublers on discounted prices. If you buy gold you are wasting time and reaources.
---
Okey, say you want to say
---
bad bot
---
If i may ask...how many trophies are u?
---
r/lootstars
---
It hurts bro üòÇ
---
PEOPLE IF YOU WILL COMMENT THIS POST AGAINST THIS PERSON, DON‚ÄôT DO IT HE ONLY WANTS ATTENTION
---
Wow, this is just amazing!
---
**sighs**  
---
Who wants to get tased?
---
If you already have pretty much every star power yes. Otherwise buying a star power to vegin with is a massive waste of resources. I am f2p, I have all brawlers. Star powers on 4 of them and have opened every single one of them from a box.
---
Man this my 4th account and others was ban or I don't like play with it I had crow for 3days and leon for 20days üòê
---
my bush camping in nutshell
---
You shit you made account just to steal others work
---
that sad 8-bit plays losing musicüò≠
---
yeah I know but I found him 3-4 months ago, then I found gene 2 months ago and then nothing else, bice game
---
Yeh I AM THE VILLAIN WE NEED
---
How did you get so many 8 bit power points you‚Äôre so lucky
---
This looks like crow but it's still pretty good:)
---
i just wanted to update you and say im really happy atm because i got 2 brawlers ( both i really wanted ) on the same day
---
Well now everyone can get to rank 20 with having absolutely no skill, more ranks got added so people are not scared of rank 20 anynore, and because of the trophy change it's super easy to push
---
Then he is stupid. NEVER buy star powers as a f2p. ALWAYS have a brawler eligeable for one tho so that EVERY box you open has a chance to get a star power. 29/29 brawlers, 6/57 star powers
---
It should be top 4 since that's what you need to get a star token. This would make this challenge a lot harder so only skilled players would get the big prize at the end.
---
Fix this fucking problem soon , supercell
---
It's because you teaming
---
And change the meta until nerfed 10 times

How can someone think he is a girl

albino leon?

I miss ricochet üò£ I bought the gold skin cause back then it was cool. Now he looks so stupid.

He shouldnt have got the pack then

Of course, like always, the community always finds stupid reasons to complain.

It's still crashing bruh pls fix it.

Probably

i have posting all brawlers jumping in spring
---
I have a question,why do a lot of artists put the "logo" of the character they are drawing in their post,like it doesn't show that in the game so what's the point?

Hot point and hot maze are not related hot maze got removed in january

Ay looks like a ps3/ps4 lol
---
No it's not that's literally Bandaid 3.0.What the point?Oh idk maybe CLUTCH WINS IN GEM GRAB OR A SECOND LIFE IN SD. Maybe clutch wins in Heist Bounty Brawl Ball and siege where literally EVERY second counts. Or against a boss in Big game once where every second counts to deal more damage to them.Or robot rumble to stop a LOT of damage. Or maybe Boss fight to create an exploit of I dunno Mortis Leon 8-bit just to have fun and survive for aaaaaaaages.Take your pick.
---
u mean rectangle??
---
haha now the autumn skins are around the cornerüòúüî•
---
OK, this looks 8 bit awesome!
---
I JUST WANT THAT SKIN.
---
How did i get cubes when u cant atk
---
That new Shelly is nightmare fuel
---
Beautiful
---
Do you really expect the game to be at the same difficulty all the time? Of course it's harder after a certain amount of trophies, the game would be way too easy otherwise.
---
Thanks man
---
For it only happening once a game that doesn‚Äôt seem worth it. It‚Äôs not often those situations are going to happen

No I prefer Shelly and colt

But it does at the training cave big boss

You clearly are not at higher trophies if that's what you think

And that crow
---
Sorry for delay. Yesterday my Reddit didn‚Äôt work

Why? Tara isn‚Äôt fun to play with, most times when you win it feels like you won despite being Tara rather than because you were her.

But his gun real tho

There's not much teaming until 700+ trophies though...

They still sit there waiting for 8-BIT.

sorry i don't speak kpop

that looks like 8-bit face
---
I finushed the challenge
---
I got bibi,Tara and Rico star power
---
This map is actually good for piper,i jumped 150+ trophies without losing
---
Absolutely, it happens from time to time and it's a blessing when it does LOL. It's just that, for every time that happens there's at least 10 times when it doesn't. Nowadays, unless I'm playing with friends, I only ever play Siege to get the star token and that's it, later I recover trophies if necessary in any other game mode.
---
It has been done.
---
I ...
---
I need some eyebleach
---
I posted here my youtube video
---
It has been done
---
I play with randoms all the time because almost all my friends have too low of a trophy count to keep up, but I have the opposite win rates as you, I always struggle in gem grab and brawl ball, but do great in siege and heist
---
Ur Primo isn't 500 trophies and ur highest brawler is 518? This is disgusting n o
---
the old siege was better at least you had a chance of a comeback in the last seconds
---
I think that it should his super wheen he dies
---
i am very sorry guys. i did not know that this is counted as stealing cause i was using this as a meme template. i am new to Reddit so i am a boob. i hope you will forgive me.
---
It happened in the middle of the play so i already got some cubes, luckily it didn't happen since the start
---
This map looks soo freaking fun üëåüëåüëå
---
No problem. I hope we can see more of your art, I really like it üòä
---
100% agree. Showdown is fine just to push some brawlers when I'm close to rank up, otherwise it sucks. Gem grab and Bounty is where it's at for me, and Brawl ball too to a lesser degree. Heist and Siege are fine with good teammates, otherwise it's a gamble that usually goes wrong.

No cause it's a set amount of damage from a star power. A 10% damage increase star power would

Nope, Android 7 with 2 gigs of RAM and a Snapdragon 425 is not anywhere near old or struggling with running the game smoothly. It is the game fault, unsufficient testing.

Nice try. You started this shit and now you're going spin the whole thing and make me the villain

Oh man, that's exciting I like it

Spike got remodeled in February after beta

That's good. I search the app store every day for good games, but nothing compares to brawl.

Wow you can clearly see that this is stolen.

I tried this trick multiple times only with randos.only time it worked got me to 12:28 because my teammates moved so all of the bots came rushing to them.the safe was gone in no time.

Not all women view themselves as victims and need constant "representation " to make them feel like they have worth. Sorry you feel that way. And for the record I think a female robot would be neat as well. Just not gonna make a pie chart about it.

Tell you what, I get both brawlers long time ago with 700+ trophies. Without any bias, both brawler have very high usage in showdown. Something is wrong here.
---
I do have worth and because of that I like expressing my opinion on things that matter to me. Sorry that you don't see representation as important, since you've never had a lack of it. If you really do support another female brawler, it's funny how you only say that now that you're backing down with your feeble apology.
---
Holy shit 
---
 Its
---
Holo-chet
---
I think it is pretty equal overal and not all robots are male like the pekka in cr is a female too and there are more humen female brawlers then male, Personally I don't really care if a brawler is male or female I think it is more important it fits the theme and its use well.
---
I guess it depends on what you do better.
---
Lol yeah, because that balances it all out. What Are you talking about?

Shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to find enemies considering they all target me

Yep!
---
????? No????? I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs because men are expected to join the military? And because men are biologically more suited to fighting?
---
Puts workout apps on home screen*
---
&gt;It was because brawl ball was way more popular then the other game modes for the most people
---
On the third slide when Shelley looses it should have said GAME OVER with the red screen, but besides that the drawing is on of the best I've seen amzing work and keep it up i can wait for another
---
The point is how supercell is lacking on the female nonhuman front, I already commented on the human male-female ratio. There's plenty of potential for female brawlers that fit a theme. Also we're talking about brawl stars? Just from the wiki page you can see that it's not even confirmed that she's a robot (never played ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø). The fact is that a MAJORITY of robots are male.
---
Patrick spike
---
Quit, I don't think Supercell wants you

I WANNA PLZ I WANNA ISLAND INVASION TOO PLZ SUPRECELL COME OM GUYS!!! UPVOTES!!!!!
---
Ah yes, enslaved *Barlet*
---
If he did someone would call it a repost, because someone did that before him.
---
damn
---
were you having a seizure at the end?
---
Oh
---
You just debunked your own point. Men are expected to join the military? Doesn't mean women don't know how to fight. so I think we can have more girls in this decidedly non military game that happens to be about fighting. (Also I'm not seeing a ton of sentient robots or genies in the military either.)
---
üòÇ
---
OH FUCK THAT'S A BIG FACEPALM! ü§£ü§£NO PROBLEM that's oküëåüòÖ
---
but for none of the robots it is confirmed that it is a male it is pretty hard to guess like for spike it is 50/50 so to put all the don't know the gender under male isn't really 'fair'.
---
Lol no apologies here, I just didn't want you to feel triggered all day and make another flow chart or something. I feel sad for people like you really...try and find joy in life sweetie.

actually did, was rank 10 in the world 10 mins ago but lost the next match because a teammate was afk throughout the whole match x(

Also I REALLY gotta say dude can you please learn math because this is neither a pie or flow chart, it's just a regular old table.
---
uh...which one are you?
---
Thanks ‚óâ‚Äø‚óâ
---
Although I do understand why this mechanic is implemented, it gets annoying when I'm playing the survivalist way. You know, hiding in a bush, waiting for everyone kill themselves to get that sweet second spot. I'm not teaming with anyone, I'm just surviving in a bush. Like a professional bush camper.
---
it was mortis heaven before it was removed
---
Guys quick note I'm not forcing you to join this clan is only for people who are new or just suck at the game,if you're already in a better clan or you're just in a clan in general then thats cool but please dont comment if youre already in a better clan it really doesnt matter to me
---
i respect your opinion but at least they were fun i also remember the time when we had two slots for showdown :)
---
And the glowing red number
---
Wow why did you get banned where you fucking annoying or was it bullshit
---
R/emojipolice
---
With 8Bit none the less!
---
I am at 7.6k but I only have 21 brawlers. How can you not push to 6k with 23 brawlers? That is less than rank 15 for every brawler.
---
You got a legendary at 6k...I‚Äôm sad :(

Amazing art but you should've made Sakura spike it would've fit the theme a bit better
---
S T A R T F R I C K I N G
---
This is so sad can we get our government to actually do something about the earth ending in a few years
---
Not sure... I will add it with other brawlers in the future
---
Yooo that would be a cool ass super. You switch into any brawler you own (chosen before the game) for a certain duration. (30 seconds or so)
---
This is AMAZING!
---
kappa logo be like

Come on just shoot someone.
---
 Why people upvote this shit i can get in mach too and dont shoot anyone till the meteors will start targeting me. 
---
What's the point of this post!
---
F for Spike as well
---
If she is your girl why do you ask me?
---
Maybe it should not giving an opinion on this but right now it isn't and it not always has to be offending women in that time it was he that was used the most common and it became a habit in dutch the word for they is the same as the word for she without actually having to offend males :). Some things have become a habbit(probably misspelled). In both ways.
---
Also it disappeared in second panel. Maybe he... Put it in?!?
---
Soulless
---
Ignore him legends like you shouldnt waste time on idiots like him
---
Good job mate :)
---
HAHAHA LMAO OMFG üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Umm ok...
---
Worth it for me. Got Spike and Rocket No. 4 from seventh mega box. (Was at .1872 legendary chance)
---
It's Solo Showdown, so everyone is against each other. Teaming is when two people team up and don't attack each other. OP was teaming with Mortis as they didn't attack each other, despite the multiple chances they each had. Teaming is initiated by spinning.
---
The team with Bibi still lost tho
---
flair does not check out
---
Where is the video?
---
Gemmers be like
---
tick is actually good as a big brawler
---
Maybe this has something to do with the showdown moon festival?
---
The background was by somebody else?
---
Saw this on YouTube 2 or 3 monts ago this guy needs to die ;&gt;
---
How did you that?
---
Ah yes really sexual
---
A ball pit?
---
Nice skin idea, but the game would have to go global first. Because there‚Äôs a chance supercell might kill it (I hope not)
---
Git gud scrub
---
I know it was removed I didn't even played brawl at the time
---
#stop the sitting
---
Little tipsy for barley
---
I like people who steal memes, very creative! You earned a downvote
---
I dont think giving people who have 10k vp is a good idea as someone could easily kick everyone if they wanted to
---
This is very nice i like it
---
Pink Spike instead of sakura
---
So what exactly happened?
---
Upvote for me
---
This is AMAZING
---
The amount of r/shittybrawlstars links on this post is the best part of this post
---
I passed to Nita and right as Nita was gonna score she hit frank into the way
---
Walls trying to team
---
I just kidding don't worry üòÇüëå
---
I‚Äôm special, I played during beta, now praise me.
---
Awesome, I liked the weapon idea the most and keeping in mind that I can't also draw in computer, its an upvote from me
---
It‚Äôs more that you should just prove your point.
---
Jake the primoooooooo.

---
I hope you head okay better now
---
How much is Phoenix crow ?
---
Halfway through the video the quality ate shit, but that's been a strat of primos for a while now
---
It‚Äôa never smart if you want to minimize respurces spent to max. But if you do it for fun. Ofcourse it‚Äôa worth it. It is a game after all, it is suppossed to be fun.
---
I hope you have friends cuz i'm guessing your parents don't love you
---
300 gems
---
Wtf really ??
---
Oh, so i get it now. Tick is complementing 8-bit. Ahh i get it now.
---
Yes and all the mecha/robo skins
---
Wth is that is holding the muddle finger
---
Yo, I saw you on Brawl Stars Global Group, this is some nice art!
---
Guess I‚Äôll get shark Leon
---

---
Yup :D
---
I did that once and whooped their asses

---

---

---
If find the concept really cool but the reward is too fat
---
Piper look badass with hair like that
---
But beware though it might considered to be spam
---
You had Bibi but can't screen her like she vanished . Wow! 
---
If they add this to the game I will buy it instantly 'cause i love squirrel ü§£
---
I have all mythical but don‚Äôt have Frank or Bibi yet ;(
---
My fan art...
---
The bullet that her turret shoots out
---
Am I the only one who cant sent club mails everytime I try to write one, the game throws me out... Please help... Please I am desperate
---
Better
---
So they return after a certain distance or after they hit a wall
---
Yeah Leon was my Friday and then I got crow and spike yesterday
---
Exactly allowing each one to do more damage
---
Who‚Äôs that guy with red hair?
---
But they disappear after hitting an enemy, or will they pierce now?
---
r/foundthefurry don't kill me
---
I made mine too lol
---
Those details though. I wish I could draw like that.
---
This is amazing, good job.
---
To actually win in brawl ball with mortis you have to learn how to do trick shots and defending, or the only way you‚Äôll win is if your opponents are trash or you‚Äôre getting carried.
---
NO!
---
Two legendary brawlers in the same day?!?
---
Most likely there was a brawler in a different bush nearby, as the game would think you were teaming. Unless the game is fine with it if you cannot see each other? I am not sure.
---
Try contacting support.
---
Hahahahaha I love this. 200 IQ. Great meme.
---
Her gun looks like a phone she's holding to her ear

So guys, how THICC is Piper? Notice these are rough estimates and this should be mathematically correct as long as everything is normal. So the technique to figure all of this out is called Pixel Measuring. Its when we find something that we have average dimensions for in the real world, and are able to count pixels and set up a proportion into the game to figure out what the sizes of in-game objects are. I have this handy dandy mobile app which will help us do this So I was pondering over objects I could use in the real world that are in brawl stars, I first thought of pipers scope, but we don't know what scope that actually is. So I came to the conclusion that Dynamike‚Äôs dynamite is the most average we can use. The average size of dynamite is 8 inches long, or 20 centimeters. Now that we have that, we must pixel measure the length of the Dynamikes‚Äôs dynamike ingame and set up a proportion between the 2. So after measuring the stick of dynamite, it is around 134 pixels long. Now that we have that, we can figure out how many inches 1 pixel is. SO we must divide 8 by 134 to get inches per pixel, plugin that into a calculator roughly gives us 0.059 inches per pixel. With that, we must now pixel measure Poco. After pixel measuring Piper, she comes out to be 260 on the dot. With that, we multiply that our earlier number of around 0.059ish to get... 15.52 inches. Or 39.43 centimeters. Sooo, how big is that. Well unfortunately we don't have any statistics just for length, so we need to also take a side view to get one last measurement. So sideways it's 190 pixels, multiply by the earlier number and that gives us 11.34 inches. We now have a rectangle, now we must inscribe an ellipse within said rectangle to figure out the circumference. So I found this online plug in sort of thing to figure out the circumference of this ellipse, and by plugging in we get 42.46 inches in circumference. Looking at CDCs, the Center for Disease Control, records, the average US waist size is 38.7 inches in circumference for a woman. And comparing to other websites I can say without a string of doubt, Piper is...... THICC. On a serious note he is actually unhealthily large and we shouldn't be celebrating it. But hey, that's just a theory, a Brawl theory.
---
for the future
---
Oh, yeah it should be Minor, mmk
---
Yes, tap the 3 dots on the post then edit
---
Imagine the last thing you see before dying is a metal bat with a smiling at you as it speeds towards your skull.
---
It looks like she's holding her gun to her ear to speak on the phone
---
I am on mobile, there is no edit when I tap the 3 dots in the upper right? :(.
---
Sorry, I'm a casual player and have a life. I hope your life is as nice as you are.
---
He has the brains you know
---
With Crow‚Äôs speed, it is very easy to dodge. Not only that, but it works on the IKE and safe, making Crow a tad more useful. AND in 3v3, it makes him a great support.
---
Therefore, Carrion Crow is good.
---
I have iT :)
---
Leave a comment or something saying whats wrong.
---
I'm the 8 bit btw
---
I would have dashed your teaming ass in a second
---
Ellllll Primoooo!!!
---
Very good, congratulations.
---
Please no. I like it as it is.
---
except when you fear if there's actually a bull or shelly waiting for you in that circle bush
---
Cool
---
If you don‚Äôt get it: look at me (spike) and frank
---
Hi i added you on brawl stars i have band-aid on shelly and both Star Powers on nita and brock
---
LESS WATER PLZ

The sound for Carl's super keeps repeating if it's active as the game ends

That‚Äôs like saying only this year‚Äôs kids remember
---
Why lol, like this is the opposite of the piper I know

---
So everybody is a kid ???

---
So sorry you can't fucking read or have deduct any
---
No, it will just make people camp even more
---
That would be way to easy to get brawlers then
---
For long posts like this, I would suggest some formatting.
---
There‚Äôs even an meteor fall at the end to show how epic it can be.
