No im not gona do that i know i cant get 500 show down wins if i tride that my trophies will go to zero XD
---
This is the most relatable post o have ever seen
---
Invidiheal is actually really good now. 6000 HP can it heal
---
A player on here told me just to focus on the bot not the other players and I've done that and I've got a hell of a lot better than I was doing before back twice I won so I can't complain
---
Red + yellow = orange. It‚Äôs night, which is why it‚Äôs darker tone. What point does that prove? &lt;_&lt;
---
What's up my beta bro
---
It would shoot extremely slippery bananas
---
Its working thanks
---
I appreciate the offer! :) but I like trying to build my own.
---
Until you realize half his skin is literally hanging
---
agree
---
I want this cuz I'm level 210 beta player
---
The problem is when you only focus on the bot all the other players will target you and you'll end up dying :(
---
No entiendo, ¬øme explican?
---
Frank said that Brawlidays, Brawl-oo-ween and Chinese New Year skins are not exclusive anymore. They will be on the shop every year.
---
XD
---
This Crow was really bad. Who the fuck would dive on Super ready Piper? The Crow should've see this coming.
---
Exactly 30, i also thought it would need more and had 260 boxes saved up, but i already got him in the 30th box and also had enough boxes to max him. I would have thought atleast 100-150 boxes, but nope just 30, also when gene came out, i also had a few hundred normal boxes and some big boxes saved up, but at the time i still had 3 mega boxes from the trophy road saved up too, i thought let's use the trophy road boxes first and the first mega box gave me gene and i was like, "well that was a fast box opening, looks like i have to save the hundreds of boxes for the next brawler"
---
I hope you can build your kingdom :)
---
Huh.
---
Yeah
---
Thx
---
Visually, I agree. Life Leech was balanced a bit differently though (only recovered 50% of damage dealt, healing star powers were both fewer and less effective) and I like Graveyard Shift better in that regard.
---
Sorry should have added /s

Just asking do u need to do the wins solo or u need to play duo with the ytuber that does the giveaway?
---
Carl is still the fastest tho
---
Either one.
---
They are? I thought they were just roommates or something.
---
We need to get this headline on brawl news
---
Spook.
---
#respect wamen
---
I mean fore me to get a free skin it would be imposibal congrats on geting the skin tho
---
VIBE CHECK
---
Those legs.
---
it would be perfect because for some reason, i'm always at 99 tokens out 100
---
That is top to bottom
---
What Brawler do you usually play for Takedown, and what rank is it?
---
Hmmm
---
Thanks.
---
Ah thank god you were sarcastic, there are too many people posting the same thing over and over again, after the first few posts, most have seen it and the next time it's posted, it doesn't get upvoted and dies in new, but when browsing new, you see the same thing many times in a row
---
Besides wizard barley XD
---
Boo
---
Poco?

CAT
---
Ok piper calavara skin color is bright yellow. If it was in a darker environment it would still be the noticebly yellow. My argument is that I would be a lighter shade. Your argument is that it would be a darker shade. Since you say the for is red that makes it more inprobable that the lighting is the reason of her skin color. So it makes my case stronger.
---
Nita just recently got a huge buff tho
---
Understandable. It‚Äôs just that they were the only person below 10k trophies in the match.
---
There is a way to do that in settings you can mute sound effects
---
I did üòÇüëå
---
And not only that, if you buy the ‚ÄúUltimate Pack‚Äù which comes with Scrappy, Duckie Scrappy, Dragon Scrappy, and Dark Dragon Scrappy. We will throw in an additional weapon of choice between are shock gun, water gun, or crossbow. For only $3500 you can take it all today, GUARANTEED!!!
---
Lol I outhealed a freaking Darryl with 8 bit and he was almost at my position aka max dmg
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre safe from this while manually aiming. 
---

---
As long as the target is in that exact spot, it still won‚Äôt hit. Same with the Darryl thing a while back, don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs been fixed yet.
---
Would love this I‚Äôd get so much lol ....lvl 287
---
Yeah it‚Äôs pretty weird
---
Really? But it wasn't actually like that before the update
---
[deleted]
---
Lokie, after my cat who acts exactly like the cat in the skin.
---
Spastic, then sits down after he has ran around for like 45 minutes
---
Honestly [LMAO](https://youtu.be/PdnO9StBJFY)
---
Do you heal off the poison (damage over time) too?
---
Yeah but what‚Äôs the point if you aren‚Äôt maxed. You aren‚Äôt getting any more tokens than usual if you take her to lvl9. A max bull can push farther in Boss Fight / Robo Rumble to get you even more tokens per ticket, thus progressing faster.
---
I wanna eat it,but i know it's wrong
---
dude should i buy leon werewolf or witch shelly
---
I agree, it works if you do it right. I bet they added the shield because of the 10 player team that tends to happen at high trophies
---
Thats the whole point of ranks
---
Uhm Joe
---
Yeah, u got me ü§£
---
Ok
---
But Pams scales with power cubes, barley's doesn't. Plus Pam also has Mama's kiss.
---
and dynamike...ish
---
How did you know he‚Äôs the next brawler
---
Awww I dont think the christmas ones are very good
---
I mean legendarys
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt get the hate for ‚Äúauto aim. ‚Äú
---
It‚Äôs called quickfire, and its whole point is to fire quickly. Like, why the heck would anyone try to manually aim with someone like Bull? It just covers the possibility of the enemy juking.
---
Quickfire isn‚Äôt a crutch, it‚Äôs a strategy. And yes, I  know, it‚Äôs better used in certain situations than others.
---
Relatable
---
Not intentionally. I wanted Spike to be up close so it's more legit when he offers a hug
---
i see in another comment you say your english is bad, so ill help you here. in reply to "thanks", you say "you're welcome"
---
It's a f4all mode not a 10 man party. Attacking other is natural anyway
---
Spike-nana!
---
Teaches you not to auto attack
---
I remember that! I got a large amount of Power Points for Jessie.
---
Reminds me of shaltear from overlord
---
It‚Äôs annoying me that you are missing 5 trophies for that mega box
---
Never said it was spam, and ‚Äúfor humour‚Äù isn‚Äôt a good excuse
---
Finally I can put spike in my ass without it hurting
---
You realize thats how they want you to feel. Congrats, now you‚Äôve enticed more of them to do it.
---
Don't forget how lagging it is
---
I just realized how low-effort that name is
---
exactly, I expected them to not choose the original name, also expected them not to name it something like "solo" lol
---
But why do they do it? Regardless if it makes me feel bad or not, it's not gonna a make them better...
---
Well then u can block all humor related posts. About 400 people would disagree with u
---
cool
---
Yes and No. if she gets hit she is screwed unless she can hit the person back
---
What are you about to do?
---
Not Me, But Who Buy Witch Shelly?!
---
Yes
---
oh ok ty :)
---
Classic but cute
---
Naming yourself ??? Will make your name invisible
---
ooh cool ty
---
I find that really hard to believe, but if it‚Äôs true, congrats!
---
Thanks
---
I only use him in solo sd to get my 550 every season but he's power 4 so as much as I would want to play the game as it's intended...
---
Spin
---
To
---
Win
---
B-b-b-but my crow... he's level 7 at rank 23...
---
***EAT MY SCRUNCHIE!***
---
Yeah. Also i love how small boxes give you 5 items instead of 2
---
Honestly if people used brawlers in different ways they would be so much better at using them, like you don't NEED to jump someone every time you have invis. Sometimes you can just pop it to get into a bush someone knows they checked, or make someone waste a few shots.
---
ur right I double checked he‚Äôs gna be 150 gems so automatically means what u said thx
---
This account is from pre-global update, I lost my original beta account, I was only missing Crow
---
So if i don't has this sp then I retarded?
---
I got spikey boi, then crow. Spike can do so much damage if you use him well, I'd suggest duo SD, brawl ball, and gem grab.
---

---
500 is still good
---
That's what I do. I'll usually sneak around to a different bush nearby, especially when I know they saw me go into the previous bush.
---
And with Invisiheal being as strong as it is now, it makes for a very good defensive get-away power. Heal up as you sneak away, and if they still know where you are for a moment, unless they can out damage the heal, they aren't killing you.
---
Plus, one thing I REALLY wanna try: fake-out an escape with invisiheal. I go invisible right in front if them after taking damage, they start firing away trying to find me. But I wouldn't have moved at all. I hope it works.

who knows , whats inside it xD:

His name is literally small troll

Did you play clash Royale by any chance?

Some thing's wrong I can feel it

Relatable, Though seriously Supercell, make the eye only appear if someone is spectating you (started spectating through you, or you basically the blue team for the spectator) Because it always annoys me when you see someone spectating but you don't know if it is someone spectating the enemy team or you.
---
 ya kinda booo and wooo but i think it is ok but it takes damage from brawlers so START ATTACKING AND STOP CAMPING
---
u dont need to pay money to max out brawlers. I am f2p and have 4 power 10 brawlers.
---
Thank you!
---
I say to you my tag because u can view my profile -_-
---
It's world war 3

Thanks!

Ikr, ppl literally will waste all 3 of their ammo plus super to kill me, and then they don't even get the power cube.

build your channel and get about 50k views constantly on your videos. videos have to be somewhat informative kind.
---
Welcome to business. They only want money. Lone Star sucks indeed. And matchmaking is far from good. I was playing with Dynamike with 700 trophies and got two teammates at 300 and 500 trophies. We lost.
---
That's actually a really good idea. Can you draw a concept of what you have in mind?
---
Not if it was a pebble
---
You're right, legendaries aren't necessarily the best. It's all about the player; I for one enjoy playing Piper. She's mostly skill based but, another issue I wanted to mention, auto aim ruins the aspect of being a "skill class" where you have to aim. I understand that the function was added to help new players perform better in games, but sometimes, it's just ridiculous that all you need to do is to sit in a bush, and to click 'fire' two or three times to get an elimination.
---
upgrade brawlers.
---
Looks better than she does in the actual game.
---
No no that is game breaking no
---
not if taht pebble was stunned by frank's super
---
My Colt went from 485 to 450 in two hours, and I wasn't just sticking to one game mode. Like I said, got stuck with many teammates that disconnect, or worse, grief.
---
the same picture
---
aito ail is specifically made for noobs so dont use it if you‚Äôre not a noob
---
Cool
---
legendaries take on average over 8 months to unlock so no it's not a bad idea .
---
Or when you are playing a 700+ thropies Brawler and 15k total but got matched with 2 dudes with 400 trophies brawler and 2k total.
---
Great, thanks for your advice!
---
Poco
---
8-bit finally having partner

Your autoaim when opponent with 1 hp goes into bush: Shoots anywhere but not the bush
---
Others autoaim when you go into a bush: _Headshot headshot headshot_
---
I guess the #NoFilter part was a lie
---
I'll call it sheely
---
Check your spelling. 
---
Also, I don't see how refering to people as "noobs" makes you any better.
---
bRiNgEr oF bAtS!
---
I want it for other game modes as well but I‚Äôm fine with just brawl ball
---
The devs really know when to make us laugh.
---
Looks at profile...
---
Well, off to go hang myself.
---
1900
---
It's satisfying
---
Maybe I'm blind but...ban what?
---
Like all another f2p games. Here you can buy boxes and get all brawlers maxed without even 1 game played)
---
I have been playing BS since global release and got 2 legendary from boxes, and 1 bought with 350  gems.
---
New game mode, i play with 300-500trophies and it is ok, but star token is hard to get.
---
And you have to know that all games become simpler during time and cheaper, so soon we willl get increased drop rate.
---
#THE BETTER
---
I have both :)
---
you can do that with this glitch. One of you be the brawler and another picks someone else. the first person readies while the other presses the brawler icon right after ready. then select the brawler you want to duplicate.
---
looks like wallhack...maybe?
---
Also at 11k, and I don‚Äôt have any legendaries. It‚Äôs just how it goes. Supercell want your money, that much is clear, and they dangle the legendaries in front of people to make the whales fork out huge amounts for them. 
---
I don‚Äôt mind a game that has aspects of ‚Äòpay now or wait a long time‚Äô to get certain content. Supercell however have pushed this to 11. With brawl stars not really requiring years and years of grind to max everything out it‚Äôs their main income stream - make people pay for stuff they‚Äôre either going to get anyway (legendaries) eventually, or for frivolities like skins.
---
DAD! i told you to get off reddit :(
---
I agree with most of what you said, but I doubt that they will make rates higher because they know they can scam some kids to buy with real money.
---
Yeah thats stupid cuz u team as well bruh
---
Sorry I forgot to zoom even more every comment
---
Yea Leon but when you learn how use him well you can make Leon not weaker
---
Leon, but compared to the other brawlers all legendaries are quite good
---
Me who plays both games:
---
I don‚Äôt like the one tile spaces
---
Yall are wrong.. It's Joe
---
the perfect art duo is Koi and Koisu
---
Shelly was supposed to have a chicken pet in beta
---
I would assume that, but are there any brawlers in general I should push?
---
wait for 65 ticket 49 gems offer.
---
She is Mama J
---
So true
---
I am soooo confused too! 
---
I sent him a friend request

But not responding

All good except the mid area (1 tiles gap)

Do you want me to edit this map? You can copy back that edit map later :)
---
showdown full in teaming in TV, that's why its not there.
---
there is only dou.
---
Recolours of 80 gem skins cost 2500. Recolous of 300 gems skins gem skins cost 10.000.
---
But Shadow Knight isn‚Äôt just a recolour, she also has a different attack animation and a different facial expression. I think it makes sense.
---
leon.
---
Yeah and she will doge it unless she's dumb cuz it goes very slowly.
---
lol,i play that game XDD
---
yeah, right, doge it. but only if she's got that shiba nita skin on
---
supercell said that they made this feature for new players so introducing this auto aim feature makes gives them a chance instead of getting destroyed by new players
---
Of course, an experienced player wont just leave his phone for a while
---
i thought they were fishes XD
---
I actually find the dark one pretty poopy
---
Put this on r/mortisgang
---
Niceee
---
Unoriginal plus why are you making fun of teamers if you‚Äôre literally teaming too? Besides, in the current meta, mortis teams more than dyna.
---
I have only tara... As mythic and i get crow i wanted gene now i have 2 legendaryes
---
are we talking about my spelling or this game? Doesnt it suck when you now have to check every time for spelling mistakes or you will be hypocrite ? üòÇ
---
Did u killed the no hat mortis? Yes. At what cost? My life  :(   (good play anyway)
---
yes but its possible to dont have something also even with 2 you can have something if the 2 first draws have the same powerpoints brawler like,your 3 draws contains each:15 shelly power points+15 shelly power points + a brawler or a star power but its very rare to have 2 times the same power points for the same brawler in a row

I dint want to see any legendary cause i have 2 and only ine mythic make no sense true?

With a 3 its possible,with a 2 less possible and with a 1 impossible unless if you have just one brawler who can earn power points

If you really had gold mechanic crow you wouldn‚Äôt have used this game mode with the special invisible skins to show off, you would have used a normal game mode. You probably bought the blue one or night, they are all the same skin just different colors. So no matter what those **will** look the same. (Won‚Äôt be respond to the comments if they are tring to prove me wrong because if he actually have gold mechanic crow he wouldn‚Äôt use this game mode skin to cover it up) sincerely- u/proxcreeper a crow gang mod
---
Nope, it was the Star Power concept
---
Is this like "Hold Your Ground" or "Steal Enemy Flag" (like Team Fotress) game mode?

Well, if you meant that, of course

Ok thanks

hi the person who i beat in brawl ball
---
hey, devs dont put all the new brawlers at once 
---
They put new brawler every couple months
---
so its normal to not have all the brawlers every single time.

Im pretty sure he was maxed out multiple times in the past.

Also you dont need to be mad i was just joking! ;)

Hi

I have a maxed account, i bought the Halloween pack (the one with 4 mega boxes) today so i could get some star powers but i only got tickets, gems and coins. Not even 1 SP out of 4 mega boxes. And i had space for 10 SP.

Me at 14k: add spike

I know he is a cactus but theese,are the only two without voice lines so he should get it

And he‚Äôs playing on a plasma screen tv

Nice job Sam! Keep it up!

They were actually acting like animals though

Yeah i know i do auto aim myself. A lot. But i learned my lesson to never auto aim near boxes and to use them to my advantage

Rise up

I don't get it

So your aim bull?

Yea, but it will change some much in the start of the game, i am not sure if supercell ever wants to change the beginning, but nice idea
---
I think 8-bit and pam team more than any brawler
---
but removes entire teams with one yellow button
---
I don't remember Lol
---
Poco+Piper=Poper?

How you put so many pics together?

No,he is only strong when others have no clue on how to play

He performs well only in solo showdown and lone star based on the map, he is only decent to good in other modes

Well this conversation is all about playing with randoms lol.

U shot him while he was invisible

I meant to ask his trophies before aha

I wont call that teaming before any comments come to say so

Even with randoms this proves untrue, yes i've had a few afk's here and there playing 3v3 but most are semi-decent

Not impossible with sd.

---
Darn it, both of my randoms went afk!
---
Quablicate
---
What ._.
---
Yes it is rare it only happens star player is given to the player who did the most damage and completed the goal for the match
---
Wow, nice idea!
---
No I not teamer we staged this
---
I don't get it. Is it very hard to complete this at higher ranks? I'm at 5k rn and it's not really a problem to win a game with randoms.
---
i kinda agree but also kinda dont because it might make the game way to easy
---
Bitch about it randoms are here to stay
---
the other team has the star player for you guys who dont understand
---
I am 10k and no legendaries.
---
I sincerely did not think AFK Arena was a real game. I see so many crappy ads for it I never would've thought to install it.
---
yes, the green area is a little off. basically its the two clouds behind the three clouds in the front
---
I have 14 K trophies and i need leon and sandy
---
Great concept!
---
I like this
---
Teaming is altough I don't like it and be hapier without it a valid strategy and again such system is nearly impossible to make and do it fair for everyone
---
Whaaaat!?!
---
1. I made this map from app "Brawl Stars Map Editor". And maybe you said abou gates? If yes. In a editor i didn't have the gates in a editor)) And if you like it upvote pls)))
---
No Poco Should Say "Nyeh Heh Heh!"
---
I‚Äôm at 6.5k without even an epic
---
Wanna have a bad time?
---
damn so i have to reset my device?
---
if theres a GS map with a lot of bushes expect SP rosa to rule the land until next map

I suggest 2nd wtar7power but even the 1st is good

After a brawler mega boxes drops nothing

Yes it‚Äôs balanced.. now tell everyone to leave it alone

Yes, Leon says "Don't make me get Nita" when he takes damage and "Hey Nita, check me out" when he is in the lead. He also says "NITA!" when he dies.

Oh, ok. I guess I just didn‚Äôt scroll down far enough

This is my channel ,,Srk brawl stars
---
No, he‚Äôs below-average without it and above-average with it. Every star power is good (very few exceptions; El Fuego rarely makes a notable difference, Rolling Reload‚Äôs really niche, Mama‚Äôs Hug is low-impact as is Magic Puffs) and Leon‚Äôs are a cut above the rest. Leon should have his star powers nerfed a bit and base stats buffed. For example, the nerf undone, Invisiheal reduced to 900,, and Smoke Trails‚Äô increase reduced to 21%. Other brawlers depend too much on their SPs (Mortis, Piper, Darryl, arguably Tara) and could use similar changes.
---
If a brawler is good with their star power in comparison to other brawlers with star powers but not good without them in comparison to others without them, that‚Äôs a problem.
---
Sit the fuck down t-series*
---
FTFY
---
He definitely did. Don‚Äôt feel bad for Zack. Feel bad for his noob friends who were completely over matched.
---
Reload speed buff, a little bit range buff and make dash overall faster. That's all

oh my god

---
It‚Äôs OP in solo modes.
---
In solo modes, 8-Bit doesn‚Äôt have teammates to both cover his weaknesses and take advantage of his booster, meaning he‚Äôs significantly worse in solo modes.
---
Thus, Extra Life just makes him pretty good in solo. When Band-Aid did the same thing except it didn‚Äôt empty Shelly‚Äôs ammo and could recharge, yeah, Shelly was really OP, but not completely broken. Extra Life is like Band-Aid but it doesn‚Äôt recharge, it halves your power cubes, and it dumps your ammo.
---
What in the actual mother spinning shitter fucker bitcher fricking peek smelly fuck
---
Yeah I‚Äôm surprised that all this time it was not around so glad to be back and have it around again but power play sounds neat üòä
---
I get that point. I wouldn‚Äôt mind if they kept it at casual game modes but removed that for competitive playlists
---
And Tara's healing shade but, all heals are needed by 4times, so if it heals 400, it will only heal 100
---
When you are using Brawl Beach This happens
---
Hmm yes, cactus is made out of cactus
---
Yeah.
---
I had the same thing
---
Leon voicelines sucks. They must need rework. I mean... Leon seemed a lot cooler before voicelines added
---
no pushed barley to 900 in brawl ball before life leach even comes to the game also i was playing bb for star token in a team before i left and change to barley I changed a brawler not an event  u can literally see me played life leach in last post so not tryna to play on anyone
---
Does rico not have one after his rework &gt;:/
---
Nope, it's actually an indie also don't r/woooosh me
---
   
---
Literally what happened to me, I got Sandy in the last box
---
thats her starpower, but it only increases every tick while her super is active and while the person she attacks is in the radius
---
When you and another brawler are just one power, and the third one is at like 6 power, it's a pretty smart idea to team then..if anything, I position myself so that the strongest brawler is in the middle between me and the other
---
Looks like minecraft skin but really good
---
It's a Rick roll, I'm not such an idiot
---
I guess I should be banned then after playing brawl ball
---
Yeah but what if the afk player still wants play but a player joins and he or her leaves the match.
---
Ree
---
Fair enough.
---
Still, even knowing that at least one person likes the old icon, I really wish they‚Äôd change it to the new one. It‚Äôs sort of like how when Life Leech was first removed, even though a lot of people liked it, there were so many new players not ready for the mode (due to the recent global launch) that it was overall better to remove it
---
Bringer of doom!

Played the game for a few weeks without lag, and then the lag just started slipping in, bit by bit.

that desperate dart from crow really complete this

it's a blet as well

So whats the point you are trying to make here?

ok, thats cool!

It only occurs when the player does not enter the match that is when he is stuck in the loading screen.. if he leaves his phone in the middle of the match they don't usually turn to bots
---
Hi.. Can i record this gameplay and post it on my Youtube channel (Lang Buaya Gaming)..?
---
I will put your Reddit name in that video :)
---
Yeah just on WiFi. Saw the same issue reported in App Store reviews too
---
yes
---
Graveyard Shift should be renamed to Star Power Scramble
---
No one could think of attacking long distance with Leon
---
Ok..
---
This woulda been a good name for dynamike. His Dyna sticks are his tnt. Tick would be good for something like coco Puffs. It's amazing regardless though, I envy your art ability.
---
Haha, I bet she is!
---
Permanent, but ueah
---
if she can count she can mount
---
Idk man, play how you feel
---
E.
---
Trophies don't mean anything. There are probably a few people who play like you at 7k and many that play like you at 10k. The difference between you and them is that they don't play as much as you.
---
If that is the case they are evil people, why would you do it ?
---
I think the 3 tick radius starts from mid.
---
Lol ,love it
---
Leon
---
ILL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK
---
You never said it's against the rules. But you keep trying to humiliate the guy because he spends money. So, you make it seem like it is.
---
This game is the most free of P2W of all Supercell Games. It's the most skill dependant. 
---
It's ridiculous how you compare to CR and COC. Stupid, honestly.
---
Just look at the most recent updates and you'll see how the game has some really F2P friendly things. You should be grateful. You don't know what P2W means. 
---
Again, you're *just* jealous and only jealous. You're complaining a lot about this Supercell Games being P2W. But you keep playing the games? Lol. 
---
You also keep saying that it's sad how people keep spending a lot of money on games.
---
Geez. It's their money. Stop fucking complaining about this. If you don't have to spend. Don't try to lower who has. 
---
And not even necessary to spend a lot of money to max your account. He can be an old player who also spent *time* on the game.
---
What a stupid bull
---
Pretty decent photoshop. Still fake though.
---
Stupid spike!!!
---
How about you earn your subs. Oh yea I‚Äôm 14k and you probably have half a trophy.
---
Crow is a toxic assassin. His damage is weak but his poison allows you to see enemy brawlers in the grass. He is also one of the fastest brawlers and has a quick reload, so you can chip away at enemies.
---
Me
---
Maybe leon does need a buff?...
---
I've been playing a long time though and I only have some brawlers at max level, that's why it's annoying THIS person can do this.
---
I dont understand how you people keep using hypotheticals like "this person might have played a long time" "eventually a F2P can get their account maxed"
---
IM NOT SAYING ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAX AN ACCOUNT
---
I'm attempting to publicly shame a P2W who had clearly spent a lot of money on a mobile game. I have spend money on a mobile game called Knights and Dragons, I spent over 1,000 on that game to regret it. I wish someone shamed me but my friends that played supported it and i spent more and more and more. 
---
LIKE ALL MOBILE GAMES its possible to do great things but CLEARLY THIS PLAYER is a P2W scum
---
And dynamike because he broke the walls
---
I love barley he's so perfectly derpy
---
Spike is gray with green eyes and a green mouth
---
Not even a long streak man. XD Happy for you but don't get too excited.
---
Chill dude, i got my first legendary only with 10.1k trophies
---
Trophies mean everything when you have all maxed brawlers! THATS THE POINT IS TO GET MAXED BRAWLERS AND PUSH THEM TO THE HIGHEST TROPHY COUNT YOU CAN
---
This person is just bad and spent a ton of money and I PROMISE will one day regret spending all that money
---
So you would want to just stick to the outsides of the fights, and slowly work away their health bars?
---
Yup.
---
Shelly is the one that needs to be nerfed, her super can stop anything with no problem
---
I said maybe you jealous? does that make me toxic? you probably havent played dota 2, counter strike or overwatch lol 
---
also because they keep adding new brawlers thats why they dont have all brawlers ;)
---
You cant get them instantly, unless you buy them with real money.
---
Yessss
---
Kind of...
---
I wasn't making a realtion between him and tournament players. Obviously he isn't good enough.
---
 But I was making to what you said that people who spend a lot of money (and tournament players do too) are usually using their parents' card.
---
So, you don't try to change my words.
---
It's sad how you're so offended because someone spends money on a game. 
---
You keep calling them sad. But I bet they're happier with the game's state than you. So, you're the only sad.
---
This "trap" you said is really something real. Sometimes people do spend way too much money on games. And I have seen this before.
---
But it's not like if EVERYONE who does has felt into it. 
---
Some are doing it for fun. What's wrong with that? If they have money to spend. Let them
---
Good work

I think that would be an amazing reward for the dedicated veterans
---
Sandy has as well,everytime he reloads he leans forward
---
Ahh, makes sense. I was thinking the season reset would be similar to other games such as fortnite. All new rewards, trophies reset, etc.
---
No :(
---
how does he eat the cereal tho? does he just smile at it till it disappears? also amazing art!
---
So they were in the game too?
---
More like actually decent random teammates
---
That's fine, and I have no jealousy for these people whether or not they can afford it, I choose to spend my money on other things, but if I got addicted I'd hope someone would shame me, especially when I was the person wasting money on a mobile game
---
So good your head will come off!
---
Yes I know but let's be real.If it there was none of the guys like him or guys who spend some money on the game.Do you think that the game would exist or even if it exsisted that it would be free and ad free?
---
It's nothin. ;)

Almost 12k. My first legendary was Leon, I was almost at 3k back than, and my second legendary was Spike whom I just bought (when robo Spike was released)
---
Yes because these games are fun and make people want to spend the money to be better. Look up video gaming whales on youtube. This person is a good example and should not be supported and this post was there to shame these people. Shame is a very strong thing and will hopefully prevent others from doing the same. I've spent money on the game to, I think you should support, not be a whale
---
No problem I understand you I would have acted the same

8-switch

Te help out, enter your credit card number, the expiration month and year, and the 3 digits on the back.

Rewards are always the same but there is trophy reset for brawlers over 550 trophies.It's simple really but there is too much of it too write you can find how it works on youtube probably.üòÇ
---
this just makes me want brawl stars on the switch even more- and i don't even have a switch

but imagine if they made that a switch exclusive free skin or somethin (only people who have a switch can get it) that'd honestly be pretty cool

you can push 1k with randoms, 900 mm with randoms does still face randoms pretty often, but yea he def did sd lol

Did he try to login with gmail account or supercell id account?

If you zoom in the face, it might be a lil better

Quite a few people here don't seem to know that tho...
