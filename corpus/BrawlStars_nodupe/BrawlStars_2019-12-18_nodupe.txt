Yes!

Darryl is hiding before Shelly uses her SOUP!

Just add a hash tag to the beginning of whatever you are typing

still open?
---
You're crazy
---
YES! She is an adorable chunky little thing
---
I‚Äôll try!
---
As it should be
---
Yeah true, we can only wait and see. I think he said it takes 3 shots regardless if whether it's supercharged or not. But yeah, just got to wait and see!
---
first see how funny is and how people play it.. because could happen the same thing with Lonestar and Takedown
---
This is what changes we need in these gamemodes
---
Although I seldom play LS,but playing TD can make me felt furustarting,last time when my 8-bit was at 1147,I when I get to the bot,it ran away.It just keep running away or just got a shelid before I can deal any single damage.This situation make me drop 26 trophies in 2 games and I didn't play any takedown after that
---
I bought that and the best I got was 3 gems
---
Crow
---
That green thing is kinda ugly, I think without could look better
---
Ah, yes. Cro.
---
Please do! We want to see a lil (toxic) birby, okay?
---
Exactly, very very VERY few people can pull Mortis off in bb. But everyone who reads this comment will go, "Yeah, I'm good enough to be part of those very very VERY few."
---
The comeback factor is one of the reasons I love gem so much.
---
;)
---
Yeah same, I couldn‚Äôt believe that this icon was the final artwork. I hope they change it and listen to the community
---
Almenos intentan sacar juguetes de brawl stars (coof.. coof..) SUPERCELL
---
It‚Äôs not even out tho
---
same
---
Oops. I said "It's the pros' fault". I meant "It's NOT the pros' fault"
---
yeah, but how will you get better, at a brawler youve rarely play? just leave people alone. dont get out of your way to change a persons preference, it is just a video game. if it makes you angry that someone picked mortis in bb, then take a break! ;)
---
It looks out of place
---
Pam: finally a worthy component
---
Shelly looks like she's hanging on to 1 string of her sanity
---
Wow
---
I did, and I quickly noticed it was a mistake. If you can pull it off, good for you. But 90% of bb mortis players can't, but try to just to earn extra cool kid points.
---
When it come to Mortis your either pro, good, bad or trash most people land on the lower two... And like 5% are on good/pro, I know I'm being generous. A lot of players I play with don't understand the role of the brawlers they play as, with brawler like Mortis you not knowing your role costed us the game.
---
I wouldn't trade LS, i would gladly trade TD though for Life Leech back.
---
Leon has seen there is no possible outcome of him living so he's decided to take colt and all of us down with him by chucking a lollipop filled with trinitroluene that'll detonate after hitting the ground
---
Reloading roars
---
Tu est le POOP
---
Thank you! I thought Leon would look doper going invisible mid-way, Piper &amp; Tick looked better using their specials in this, I literally just realized right now that I forgot to paste in 8-Bit's shooting effects (LOL), Bull/Darryl/Shelly looked better to me as a sticker not using their several bullets, Frank&amp;Mortis' attacks don't make too much sense mid-air (I could at least make Nita's work), w/ Bixby&amp;Bo it didn't really matter to me, and I think Penny looks cooler with the bombs around her
---
Legendary brawlers can only be found in boxes. So if you have 14k trophies just because you play all day, rank up, but open few boxes, this doesn't get you more more chance of finding a legendary than playing only when you have tokens, get to like 8k, and opening the same amount of boxes.  
---
I only play when I can gain tokens, so I'm still at 11500 trophies, but the only brawler I'm missing is Crow.  
---
And, as Spal\_hero as said, the point of a 'legendary' brawler is that it's extremely rare, having it on the trophy road makes no sense.
---
Kairos puts in his LIFE into yt
---
Haha
---
Not s√≥ Fun fact: New accounts starts with the legendary chance of 0.10(random)
---
they still have to give sneak peak for max, today was for bea
---
el primo
---
jessie
---
shelly
---
Bo
---
&gt; The fact that there are many unskilled players who only lose in BB with Mortis doesn‚Äôt mean he is bad.
---
Yes it does and this is why:
---
If he is good in the mode, that means he is inherently good. And if he were inherently good in this mode then most people would be able to just pick him up and play and win.
---
Don‚Äôt you see? If Mortis is good, then why do I have to be super skilled with him to win? The brawler himself is NOT good here. The player has to be skilled. And a match they‚Äôre winning with Mortis is one that they would have won anyway using a different brawler.
---
Oye amigo vienes de tontolandia?xd
---
I doubt it since this is a bigger update but idk
---
I rather supercell take am extra day to fix as much big as possible
---
My most played brawlers are non-legendary, btw. Though I only got Leon yesterday (from brawl box lol)
---
Bull and Primo: Having an Armwrestle like the men they are
---
Mortis: Drinking out of Emz' smoothie
---
Emz: Looking at Poco
---
Poco and Frank: Jamming with the boys 
---
Barley: Being himself
---
Nita: \*father i crave cake\*
---
Piper: Looking for her next contract
---
My highest is about 756 I think.
---
Well there is to maxout alll brawlers. And this is just done playing everyday and planing where to spend gems or with money
---
Tf
---
Tick is the worst
---
Will Smith carl
---
Yeah i was wondering why the heck she looks like m and m's character
---
Do mortis next
---
I've honestly stopped playing these modes as they just take the fun out of the game. These changes might bring me back to the mode, especially the assist one for LS.
---
DON'T BELIEVE HIM, HE'S A COP, RUN...
---
Ok
---
My point is you‚Äôd have 1k if you played gem grab, lone star, etc...
---
You know, a mode he‚Äôs actually good in. You‚Äôre really holding yourself back by pretty much only playing him in brawl ball.
---
Regardless, congrats on your achievement. I hope you think about what I‚Äôm saying and try him out in Lone Star.
---
I got Spike yesterday, whilst my friend pulled 2 legendaries back to back a couple of months ago, so I got my legendary.
---
U good

Lol I just want Leon
---
no me hab√≠a dado cuenta que hablas espa√±ol xd, buenardo
---
Ayyyee thanks manüëåüèøüíØ
---
I am ok with both modes, but yes. It can be a hassle to keep up.
---
Since takedown is active as of when I commented on this. My side issue with the Boss‚Äô rocket modifier is the sheer terror of those rockets, because you don‚Äôt know where they will land.
---
So, why not have an indication of where the area will be targeted, like how there is a area circle of where the rocket will explode from the Boss in boss fight?
---
You know what somebody actually gave spike a hug therefore I must give you a reward.
---
*After the hug* #AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
I gave you a gold BTW.
---
i think max will be released in the next weeks, for not lose all the content in one day I guess (because one of the things that players more care about is the brawlers). Today was Bea sneek peek so my prediction is tomorrow will release the update and later the sneek peek of Max
---
I would imagine penny would be taller, seeing as she‚Äôs a pirate
---
many thanks
---
It would be nice if boss had set health points when he shielded so it wasn't random. (75%, 50%, 25% or 66% 33%). I like your ideas for Lonestar I wouldn't hate the mode so much with the assists on kills

---
No th update is Thursday
---
I don't think it would be quite the same without seeing the boss explode at the end, but interesting idea. I agree that the power cube system in Takedown might need some work, although I don't have a concrete idea.
---
Who said?
---
Tbh I don‚Äôt have Morris but I always thought he was op in brawlball cuz my brother uses him a  lot and when I watch him use Morris he almost always scores and wins unless he‚Äôs with really bad ransoms for teammates
---
What's wrong with assist kills? It works in so many other games.
---
The brawlidays logo has a hidden number (19) and today they released Bea info. Sooo tomorrow would be for max info an then the update drops on Thursday Wich coincidence is also the 19th
---
Everyone likes puns
---
Spike is happy now all he needs is to speek
---
I did that on accident. I thought I was on showdown
---
Colt bull and Pam have been huge for me...just beat i7 with colt colt Pam, I usually find that having 2 Colts get me through the tougher levels but you can't plan that one, obviously

---
How will changing the number of players change the matchmaking?
---
for all who are asking "Whats your problem" and "What is the problem i Cant see".
---
Its not my Problem its everyone problem .Look ate the power level under each brawler.  If game contiues to match match 3 level 10 brawlers or keep all maxed brawler in one group. Then winning game becomes hard. 
---
So i requested supercell to fix this problem.
---
OMG ITS SPIKE HI!
---
they should add all the modifiers to lone star
---
great idea btw
---
With spike, it‚Äôs easy!
---
PFFFFT please! I have 5! Don‚Äôt worry bout it!

---
It doesn't matter since Matchmaking is the one thing that needs to be fixed right now. I hate when I'm playing duo showdown and I find myself getting matched against 8k-10k tryhards that ruin the game experience.
---
But Piper is never seen in brawl ball. I really don‚Äôt understand your logic.
---
Hugz for spikey boi
---
 Let‚Äôs repeat what the last person said, shall we ?
---
His face says a thousand words, my friend
---
hip hip
---
#THAT WAS SO WORTH IT!!
---
GIMMENY SHEIT WOW! Thanks a bundle!
---
Well, this would cause long queue times, but to tbh, I rather have matchmaking take 5 years instead of taking 5-10 secs and finding myself playing against a team of all maxed out brawlers.
---
These are quite possibly my 2 least favourite brawlstars youtubers
---
Finally something i can actually stand to look at
---
Bottom left corner, my dude! It‚Äôs my seal!
---
I play Piper on brawl ball, and win too
---
ME TOO!
---
I opened and I got carrion crow
---
Ayup!
---
Brawlers have to be good in general to be considered as good. Anecdotal examples don‚Äôt mean anything. To prove Mortis is good, you have to prove he is good in BB as a general principle, which is frankly impossible considering his win rate.
---
T H I C C O
---
Let‚Äôs not go crazy here ü§ó
---
Wait really? I play in Spanish, and never see a name like that. (Also I don't play Takedowns, I can't with it)

Mah hart, mah sole

Almost... everyday actually..

I'm a sweaty BB player, I play over 20 matches of BRAWL BALL ONLY a day
---
Many thanks

Rico is my spirit animal.

It‚Äôs not fun when I‚Äôm matched with him and lose. Someone could use that logic to say‚Äù I wanna play Piper in Robo Rumble cuz it‚Äôs FUN!!!‚Äù
---
üòê
---
Look at my newest post bro I didn't know how to share photos
---
Knowing that Bea existed cured my depression
---
Ok but don't report people for playing Mortis on boss fight because mabey they did it on accident and there not doing anything bad so it won't matter anyways. It's just a game and you only lost 1 ticket.
---
You bet your sweet bippy it is!
---
I am crying...
---
Brawlers have to be good in general to be considered good in a certain mode. Anecdotal examples don‚Äôt mean anything. To prove Mortis is good, you have to prove he is good in BB as a general principle, which is frankly impossible considering his win rate.
---
Wow I didn't think anyone would post this. This ain't a big problem
---
Ima head out

*step step steppy step*

Brawl tv is based on the trophies of the brawlers currently playing. One of those brawlers has high trophies is all this means. Clearly he's just getting around to boss fight now

that is literally one of the most useless posts ever

it happens when darryl rolls on water for too long

I may not play Lone Star at a very high trophy level usually due to the brawlers I like for it but I don‚Äôt really have any problems with it. With that said however, I do really like all these changes. Especially for Takedown. That mode slays me.

R/shittybrawlstars. I'll tell you why you can't get a legendary its because you constantly whine about not getting it. Like just play the game normally. The legendaries are not even as good as some of the other brawlers and perhaps you have shit luck.
---
Yea I know that I'm just sayin that no one in brawlstars has a name with no more than 8 letters
---
This reminds me of the mike wazoski meme
---
They're probably just friends and they partied this guy lmao. (bad idea for the enemy team.)
---
Wait they nerfed him again?
---
Remember solo showdown isn't communism.
---
You can't split the trophies

I only understood this after reading comments. Pretty funny after fighting it out.

I fell lile i'm the only one colt who don't attack other people, yesterday i get kiled by Brock who keep shotting at me(he get 8 place)

youre a genius .

I had the same thought when I lost all of my lone star battles. I support this.

So we are not gonna talk about how he took images from google

sushi is what shoots, I would see it well even on the rebound effect
---
In lone star, losing half of (or all) the stars upon death would improve the competitive environment also maybe?
---
Soon brothers...

I think that rounding up would be too much. For example, if I kill a 3*, someone would also get 2 just for the assist.

And they said thicco was thicc in the game
---
I know but.... There is nothing in the picture related to brawl stars, you can just say happy brawlidays without a picture
---
1.more bot spawn, stronger big bot.more rocket/laser/dash
---
2. they aren't necessarily bad, you are playing a tough level. if they are playing good brawlers and focusing the bot, that's good enough. 
---
3.
---
4. yes
---
Actually he really is

thank you for the detailed answer

I kinda suck at explaining, sorry

Sorry but.... Thank God that you are not from the developers team

All this to give me a cuddle?

not good enough.  it's ok amount for upto super rares.
---
Instead of rewarding assist kills, I think it should be done by rewarding highest percentage of damage
---
Highest damage dealer to someone gets half bounty even if he doesn't get the kill

Ok about takedown. Lone star have some RNG, but, at least, it can be solved in the future with some balance. Takedown is going to be always a casual gameplay.

Your chance of getting a legendary doesn‚Äôt change if there are new brawlers out. The only thing that will go down is your chance of getting star points and coins. So I would say wait

 LoL Pam.
---
Me and my friend call her mama.
---
it was an amazing drawing
---
10K is just beginner stop complain
---
Where's gene?
---
That's obvious
---
The tile they spawn in should have dirt or they'd be spawned on water.
---
Me neither, thats why my first skin for colt will be corsair colt
---
Nah, it's from a mod
---
the world record is insane 16 i think before carls reload got nerfed the comp was pam, carl, bull
---
It‚Äôs fine to attack others if u didn‚Äôt mean to hit them or to charge up ur Super. But killing others really ruins the fun in the gamemode for them.
---
Mortis, El Primo or Dynamike?
---
Good choice but sadly I have already  Royal agent colt
---
Yup
---
Its...cute?...funny?...idk
---
He is good for solo mode like Lone Star or Showdown
---
And no gems? I have only 80 at the moment
---
#?
---
Ik me too
---
Colt skin cost 150 you need to use wallet
---
It's his Code name before The game launched
---
El primo
---
This will be really hard to add in the game
---
[insert big brain meme here]
---
Hmmmm, or making a lot of boxes untill Christmas
---
#ITS NOT THE FIRST TIME I DID THIS
---
r/beatiful
---
I got 1,1,2 in this power play lmao.. colt + slick boots
---
r/beautiful
---
Now thats art
---
No more immune boss is best
---
70gems are quite alot you need tons of box
---
Now that is art
---
No
---
There go's your chances for the two new brawlers
---
Sniper paradise
---
Can you upgrade it?
---
This is a perfect example to show how to NOT use this template
---
That's what I was thinking too so I opened it
---
#OO *THIGHS*
---
You...didnt.. Ok
---
# *CHALLANGE ACCEPTED*
---
not so difficult
---
Good luck lul
---
**good grief**

üòãüëâüëâ

#FUCK
---
I got him from the mega box
---
ive had some really BS moments
---
Ive disconnected twice and lost 10 trophies.
---
I disconnect and i get 2nd and dont gain any trophies
---
Id like to see this feature so i dont lose 10k trophies because of shitty internet
---
Yare Yare Daze
---
it's always better to open the small ones first - since the chance is just divided by x3 or x10 (big/mega box).  
---
So open the small boxes first - then big boxes then mega boxes.
---
Hard to explain but it makes sense when you think about it
---
Barley is now a *hard* difficulty robot (u know that purple one)
---
Brawl Stats.
---
Takedown and lone star and solo showdown r the best modes in power play ( I actually mean it )
---
Huh i got 48 Coins , Frank and Mortis power points and tickets
---
Wish they gave more coins tho
---
The attack starts from behind mortis, so if you time it right you can hit the enemy as well as escape
---
No, there's only a superhero wannabe.
---
What's that? Rosa's assistant? Never heard of them.
---
Ready as ever boi
---
More like piper 9.0
---
Because You are Ok with Your brawler
---
Try using mortis
---
But the gene has 100 hp
---
Ight imma head back in
---
I... have.. everything max with both star powers...
---
I seen this before
---
Sadly they won‚Äôt add it since people would abuse it.
---
I GOT 2 REWARDS FROM THE BIG BOX
---
So youre probably right :)
---
Now this is art
---
You wish...
---
Snappy Sniping?
---
We found a ~~pro player~~ p2w
---
Only 80's kids will remember this (8mins in big game)
---
Bea is a Versatile Piper 
---
Change my mind
---
So glad I have it
---
Actually, not fully p2w.... 200$ on this game (including 40 skins...)
---
That's what p2w mean...
---
Too many walls, not much space for bolts to spawn, there are one-tile gaps.
---
Yeah, u can say that.
---
This map remembers me that old map of heist
---
How do u guys get the Brawler icon near your name?
---
Kay dude it's like 4 AM for me. And the update ain't here
---
You can choose a text post instead of a video/photo post when creating a post lmfao
---
That just seems way too complicated tbh
---
‡∏Ç‡∏µ‡πâ‡∏Ç‡∏¥‡∏á
---
Ah , yes BOobS
---
your brother really needs to get original with his usernames.
---
Shelly looks like she seen shit
---
Ok so how does everyone get star powers out of the big box but I only get 30 coins
---
Harry.... Could you get me some fireseeds?
---
*sad KairosTime noises*
---
I have them all so why would I be
---
ok b
---
My legendary chance is now 0.2214, I have been playing since the day it came out last year, I have no legendaries but every other brawler‚Äôs tokens, just need the money to get them all to power 10, this update it going to be painful
---
Where do you think is Barley?
---
See, I have no idea
---
I cant see the balance...
---
Everyone else in solo showdown: plays max and bea
---
Me: plays 8-bit so he can enjoy the speed for a few seconds
---
r/uselessredcircles
---
I like how shelly breaks the door then the colors stopped thinking
---
Wow i love this
---
I have 2 Mega boxes from trophies road, 10 big boxes and 253 small boxes waiting for new update to be released üí™
---
Rare pam awesome
---
Not matchmaking. The El Primo was in the same lobby as the other 2 and DECIDED to play with them as a team. Matchmaking counts the one with the most trophies.
---
If you use your 160 tickets, that would be about 40 boxes more
---
And max as speedy i guess
---
Nice
---
Rare pam, Common Darryl, Legendary Frank, Common Piper, and Common Bibi are my favorites too
---
Oof you might actually be right sorry.
---
Then tell your mom to cut out the wifi tonight. Then you won't see spoils
---
yep. high chance that update might be today
---
no boxes saved but i have 78 gems can buy pirate poco i only need 2 gems
---
Yes
---
Darryl is very good Brawler on this map
---
this is now official, not leak
---
I say it leak, okay?
---
she\*
---
El primo in the back like
---
Try going into App Store, click your profile to go to purchased apps, once you find brawl stars I was able to press update.
---
I saw in the store: available on 2d 19h and few minutes later it disappeared
---
Decreasing the number of players to 8 should balance out with the 40% map area decrease I also suggested.
---
When is max coming out?
---
Bruh nice
---
If you have a supercell account you could uninstall and then re get it and not lose everything.
---
[previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/eb10ks/i_dont_care_about_new_brawlers_new_skins_fix/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
You don't.
---
So should I go ahead and open my boxes or wait for max?
---
make for all the brawlers they are better than the Xmas colaboration
---
Isn't another brawler coming out?
---
Same thing happend to me but with sandy,i didnt even save boxes and first i opends i got sandy
---
Bruh got her in first box
---
Dude you must've gotten a 1000 token doubler that's all
---
Restart your mobile phone than go to App Store.
---
love u much thanks man
---
yes i habe the same problem
---
Fighting other players is part of the game mode. Just spamming damage at one target is uninteresting.
---
I am too
---
yeah, i agree. these forced messages are really annoying and useless. they should be there, but still have the option to chat regularly too.
---
iOS has had issues with Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia today as well. They were sent the update early to avoid delays and they still messed it up.
---
I spawned at the top side of the map...it‚Äôs my first time seeing this
---
Why didn‚Äôt u save them to try to get max too
---
Nice, crow can't do shit with his feathers wet
---
Barley lookin' snazzy
---
Is this a new ep havent seen it before?
---
It was showing up in the brawler section until a while ago. Don't know if supercell removed it now or that was a bug?
---
Thank you
---
OMG, they are back!!!!
---
Wow, very cool!  Not one but TWO new brawlers to destroy my legendary drop rates!  Guess if I'm unlucky enough, I'll NEVER ever get a legendary thanks to new brawlers.
---
Very nice.
---
I get doing this with randoms but we should be able to chat normally with friends
---
Pirate skins are also limited
---
I can't enter the supercell id page
---
VeeeEEErY yeS üòéüëå
---
I like the boobs you draw =)))amazing lol
---
The same happened to me in Brawl Ball
---
Ohhhhhh your right! The game always changes perspective so that everyone spawns bottom, this is odd
---
How can I use it on my phone
---
Bea is out today... If anyone knows more about Max, I am listening.,..
---
Should we tell him he's been playing on practise mode...?
---
It‚Äôs fixed
---
Santamike is awesome, I am going to buy Red Nose Nita because she is so cute.
---
no, it just doesn‚Äôt work for ios rn. it‚Äôs really annoying they couldn‚Äôt have this update work correctly.
---
It‚Äôs fixed now
---
Out of curiousity, can they be used outside holiday seasons? :)
---
yeah, true. at least give us the option to have it on or off.
---
You can already play without randoms. Party up for the league. I'm sure championship challenge will be the same.
---
If you press the chat button you should be able to chat normally.
---
Yeah, I tried to play Bounty and for the first minute it was fine, but then it started lagging like crazy and I couldn't see anything.
---
nah it isn‚Äôt it‚Äôs season 1 ep 9
---
Same
---
Same issue, on iPhone 8 while my friends has ¬¥o problems...
---
Same situation with me
---
Dyna a d penny
---
7 AM and the update is here.
---
The "19" in the BS logo was false
---
Give me
---
i cant update my game :/
---
Damn bruh i was hoping they would release new christmas skins so i can keep the OG status for my xmas skins from last year.
---
I hope they will fix it.
---
I did, I‚Äôll see what they can do. I also contacted map making contest host Mordeus and he said that he‚Äôll pass it on to the dev team. Hopefully it gets fixed.
---
Same shit bro
---
I thought you were going to save it for max
---
Yip, I checked again. Thanks man :)
---
üòÖ
---
no problem man have fun :)
---
I tried restart and it still didn‚Äôt work. Please upvote for visibility
---
I'l guessing 1-2 weeks
---
Yes!!! I'm excited too!
---
Where is the chat option???? I can't chat in a party anymore??? Only the suggested things as well played and hey...?????
---
Please help!! We can't discuss strets right now...
---
i cri
---
Same but i just got mecha bo so i cant try him out
---
When will she be out
---
What about Darryl Remodel?
---
 Lol, the problem is gold, I don't have enough gold for every Brawler
---
They can be used, but cannot be bought.
---
I don't think it's meant to look like that
---
Funny thing is that there's no shop offer to buy the new brawler. I thought I'd simply buy this epic and spend boxes on the mythic. But looks like they really want us to empty out box stock
---
It‚Äôs working now
---
Robo rumble is the best one to crank crates by far. With this new team feature it will be way nice fore people who haven‚Äôt been able to get together in the past.
---
 Yeah man, that's why I divided the boxes for each one ... To keep waiting
---
Probability has nothing to do with supercell
---
Got pam and frank when trying to get bea
---
nice i open 13 box and one big box and just jessie star power ( +800 pv turret )
---
Had only 10 small ones and 2 big ones so i thought why not just open them
---
I have the same problem
---
I totally agree with you for making the maps smaller. Everyone wants it and I don't get why they haven't done it yet.
---
Am i p2w or f2p if i used 600 ron on brawlstard at 1900 till 6k but now im not buy8ng anything for real money (11k)
---
Thanks for this!
---
its shit
---
me too haha, I'm locked on my smurf
---
AAAA PD I LOVE THIS!!!! Really love how you paint your characters \^\^!!!!
---
That just happened to me too, but in the replay we were alright
---
(News on Brawl Cards (Brawl Stars x Hearthstone) probably soon, btw)
---
I also had this bug. I tried rewatching the video but on replay everything's normal.
---
HSAD
---
im scared
---
they are limited, in normal times you can‚Äôt buy it so Supercell have the right to that.
---
Also, the fact that they are limited make that buying one is more special to see in matches or lobby
---
Dumb question.. maybe.. um.. 800 trophies means total trophies or brawler trophies?
---
Ummm... I just opened up 127 Brawl Boxes and didn‚Äôt got Bea (my epic chance is at 0.5) neither a star power (I literally have 19 star powers available to get from Brawl Boxes). What the heck
---
#Thx#
---
You're welcome, keep the change
---
Hahah you rebel
---
Happend to me, just went on Reddit to look if someone had already posted this.
---
Metal Slug(no
---
What ? They are't ln my update yet !
---
It‚Äôs not only in Heist, it happens in other game modes (check my post, I played in new mode).
---
Yeah Tara is everywhere atm.
---
pirate icon have a patch, usually patches are bigger than the eye zone
---
big oof
---
That would be too op
---
Can't wait too buy the new skins!!!
---
It wmis posted a hundred times.
---
Can you give me the unedited clip
---
*sounds of angry*
---
This. My og account is locked out of my ipad due to my gf playing there last night. I now am unable to play with my account, on,y with hers ‚òπÔ∏è
---
Is the inverted gameplay part of it or a bug?
---
I was soo much frustated after not being able to log in to other account.Hopefully suoercell will fix it faster.
---
Me too, for some reason the true red team is being shown from the true blue team‚Äòs perspective. It happened to me on pirate plunder
---
False, it was only rather recently (around 3-4 months ago) that they made the decision to bring the skins back.
---
When the skins came out in December 2018, they said 'Brawlidays 2018 skin', and the mentioning of the year implied that it was exclusive. Then they changed it to just say 'Brawlidays skin'.
---
I think what the OP was implying is that the skins aren't as much value anymore since they're re-released, they felt more special since you could only get them last year Christmas... now it's here for everyone again :(
---
Why didn‚Äôt you wait 2 days for Max?
---
I remember there's clash royale version of it
---
Oof
---
Nope,she is weak,she needs buff.
---
I don't say that they should only buff her speed,they can lower her hp or damage,but she needs to be fastest brawler in the game
---
Can't find Captain Colt skin is it not in store or do I have to buy other skins first???
---
# Cool
---
What‚Äôs the big bruh
---
Are you serious?
---
So the other account is completely GONE? Forever?
---
They look so original did Supercell hire you?!
---
I have a .3000, yes, it's true, I'm the meme 14k player who never pulled a legendary
---
Why not remove Power cubes from TakeDown?
---
But... why?
---
the bug gonna be solved tomorrow surely,they identified the issue
---
Wroooooooong, it the 18th. CHIIIIIILLLLL OUT BRO
---
bro üòéüí™
---
Probably we'll have a maintenance break soon
---
Can't play any Solo Showdown without seeing Taras everywhere... smh
---
supercell when are you going to fix this? cant play!!
---
Are you on Android? This happen to me, after hit 100% the main menu appeared for just one second and the game crash every time. I solve it going to settings and forcing the stop of the app. After that the game went good as normally
---
Sooo Nice üëå
---
is this real?? it looks 100% legit
---
Nice...i opened like 10 boxes....and still got no brawler
---
I was saving up since August so i can buy all 3 brawlidays but i would reccomend dyna
---
That's literally how it's designed to work??
---
Yeah that's what I thought too.
---
Do you think they removed the ID thing on purpose or did they just mess it up accidentally?
---
Yess this exactly happened with me! I was about to post that to reddit but it isn't letting me upload idk why.
---
I am asking if IT IS normal to start in the top of the map
---
Yes, It was made by supercell. currently hidden
---
No you are not!
---
Basically the same strategy as Brawl Ball, but this time you can pass over walls :)
---
Okay, thanks for answer :)
---
Aw... try simply clearing all its data, then. It's the only thing I can think of...
---
Yeah me
---
El Primo whem Rosa is around
---
Why the hell are we spawning at the top?
---
Im just completely maxed
---
5/5 is cursed
---
No.
---
Same happen to me Idk to be honest
---
To bad I cant get on my account
---
Keyword second account. These shellies have no fucking clue what positioning is, and play like bots on shrooms
---
What? It should be switched
---
Team speak jessie?
---
Yep
---
I mean easy compared to legendary or Mythic. You normally don't have to wait a long time.
---
Pls share that replay with us
---
Question: in sprint test, is carl's super allowed? I mean you can control his movement while using his super so its fair right? Also if its allowed, can you please confirm whether he's faster than max or not?
---
It‚Äôs so dumb
---
r/madlads
---
Team speak brock?
---
I think thats how it is now
---
I am on android yes. My game never hit 100% and what you suggested doesn't work :(.
---
 Nice
---
you can't buy captain or corsair so why not.
---
me
---
with not knowing how boss shoots lasers, how did this colt even get to insane II?
---
lel thanks anyways xD
---
Rule No.1 of posting app page screenshots: NEVER show the apps unrelated to your post
---
Still only 0,20~ players are above 10k
---
It is supposed to say someone's profile pic looks good, but they look nothing like it
---
I think the trick only works for Android. In iOS, the only solution is to reset your device completely, then install brawl stars and do the trick
---
Congrats man
---
Just curious though, what was the original name of the map? I imagine they changed it to fit the theme
---
Anyone who knows why it happend?
---
Um... no
---
it happend to me when i was trying to post genes new animation about 3 weejs ago
---
If you can, use Rosa, she has got a good victory rate in this map. I did 1, 1, and 2. Its very very good
---
optimization is missing. please fast
---
gg bro
---
true... i usually get teammates that have no idea what they're doing
---
present plunder was easy but brawl ball is hard as hell you cant even see the other team how can you even shoot them from long range üòÇ .as a barley it was worst experience
---
Amazing!
---
How good job
---
–°–ø—Å
---
Where you do maps?
---
I had 25 boxes and a big box
---
And i dint got her
---
Bull is one of the best and you have him D tier?
---
Already posted it there
---
White people are superior and thats why he doesn't get laid
---
El Primo used some illegal things
---
no, not working :(
---
It‚Äôs happened to me twice
---
What is that game on the left bottom Corner?
---
But Max speeds up teammates too.
---
It's a bug I think
---
Clean brawl stars cache and force stop. For me this worked
---
Just happened to me too. This is the kind of bug I wanna consider more of a feature though, I liked the change of perpective.
---
what happen to the map, I respawn from the top
---
How do I reach this level of hoarding
---
I cant get to brawl stars it's crashing
---
Sorry for the poor content but it's my first post
---
And yet you get 5k teammates as well as 14k noobs (not all of them ofc). That's why I also check their XP but no one has that much
---
I got it in 8
---
Same this happen is gem grab and brawl ball
---
Same thing with Dynamike
---
Same thing happened to me
---
Yes he did got smaller
---
Does he has special features ? like specials animation etc
---
Mortis is op cause he can ‚Äúdribble‚Äù the present like in bb
---
This bug has been happening since the update came out. Not after the maintence
---
Why so many Emz points
---
I have 12k trophies but i lost my account üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
oof feels bad man
---
You stole this from a YouTube thumbnail
---
Yeah before last maintience
---
wait till max release
---
Yeahh
---
UnBEAlievaBULL
---
Brawlstars is a game designed for kids, and yet here we are
---
I really don't like how I cant have free speech in groups anymore
---
Frank is pretty decent with his stun and high health
---
It‚Äôs fixed! Restart your game to gain access!
---
Its working rn
---
Restart the game! It‚Äôs fixed!
---
Ok thanks.
---
Is better a ‚Äò‚ÄôRicochet skin‚Äô‚Äô for Rico than Bull
---
JOTARO THEME STARTS PLAYING
---
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=videoeditor.videorecorder.screenrecorder
---
Agree, is so much fun
---
How to get it
---
Haha I'll never forget doing the old Mortis glitch just kiting all the bots around in circles
---
I wonder how mortis would be seen if he was legendary, if people would be wanting him nerfed because more people learned how to play him well
---
Nah, he didn't. He was only on top of the cactus, the cactus wasn't through his body. The video is time to brawl.
---
DAT ONE SKULL IS BLOCKING MY WAY!!
---
The Supercell id is not workign
---
Literally nothing. After a few days, there was a big box and I got Mortis.
---
Hehe boi :)
---
Oooou
---
There's sakura spike..
---
Hey man bigfoot is an app that lets you download and record your battles on bralwstars for free try it
---
Maybe buy an android phone? :))
---
The reason leon doesn't get a buff is because he is balanced right now. He would be OP if he got a buff. Can you please understand?
---
I know. That's why I put him there. As a mascot.
---
really?
---
Ohh, good
---
Yeah....
---
Whos you?
---
so luckyÔºöÔºâ
---
I'm at 14.2k with just spike :(
---
No shit you didn't insult me. And no shit... Why am I even wasting my time? You bragged like an asshole, yet you keep denying (no suprise). You think you're hilarious, yet you're just toxic. Glad you're finally leaving! Bye! No one wants you here anyways.
---
Looks like el primo i swear
---
#IIIII NEEEEEDDDD ITTTTT
---
I see myself scoring for the opp team lol
---
He wants you
---
How do you not go crazy grinding recolors?
---
same thing happened to me. definitely the weirdest game ive played
---
Oh no...
---
it may be for free
---
Hope you can boy it, in my opinion one of the best skins in the game
---
Yes in heist it was a nightmare
---
SOMEBODY TOUCHA MY SPAGHET
---
How the fk does that guy have maxed out Bea
---
Ya they shifted down the button sed lyf
---
God imagine if this is actually a new feature (thanks for sorting by new by the way)
---
Where do you get game files
---
Imagine someone playing Frank
---
Its pirate theme, obviously stolen. /s
---
Those were the days :)
---
What was wrong with supercell I'd?
---
my braincells doed so fast that i just cant blame my random poco teammate for using theyre super after they died, it was just too fast for a proper reaction
---
The next few hours of my job are dedicated to getting them
---
Gz dude. I like this map.
---
Thats could be possible! You made a good point. It was the old model so i guess they'd very likely give it to all players.
---
I‚Äôm happy to not be the only one
---
No go to Kairos
---
Hey is it showing Spike in the gif? I had put it too but I can't see it!
---
Just now (before 2nd maintenance break), we can't connect to our 2nd (Supercell) ID
---
Lol i Got crow two days ago
---
It is still available for a limited time.
---
Yessüòíüòíüò£
---
It's pretty much a win-win situation for everybody, more people would be able to buy skins without worrying that there would be better skins in the future which means they would spend more money on skins and supercell gets more ez profit
---
He looks like ricochet before remodel
---
I'll admit. I considered the idea to be nothing but crock. But this skin is pretty fucking cool. I guess I'm glad people wanted it back.
---
That happends to me too
---
Congrats made! Would love to try your map:), you sure be feeling proud.
---
Seriously? After the buff I hate him. I don't think it's about skill anymore, he's just so op.
---
I hate new showdown maps, so in theblong run, this update sucks. I can give up all those awesome features to have the showdown maps back. Btw, Im changing my reviews from 5 stars to 3 bcuz of this crappy update. Downvote me all yall want.
---
But Bea is already here 
---
Open the boxes a little
---
It‚Äôs after I talked with them
---
is this real???
---
Wow. I miss it to . And I wonder if possible coming back? But it look like it's coming back better than ever!
---
If you were Russian....
---
Ismin g√ºzel
---
Why are you removed all of Showdown maps? And Hot Maze was my favourite! Stop map removing !!!! You destroy the game!
---
i hope it is the last free reward at 24th december
---
It happends to me too
---
Umm jessy should be electrocuted, crow should drown, unless he became a duck...
---
In 118 boxes
---
You must to have bass
---
Whats the big deal with being f2p?
---
I don‚Äòt know why, but getting legendary and mythic brawlers is damn easy for my account, but i wont get epics, i mean i had every brawler maxed, when leon came out i got him in the 20th box, when gene came out i got him in the first box, when bibi came out, i needed (well i don‚Äòt remember, but around) 100-150 boxes, when sandy came out i got him in the 30th box and now for bea i had 312 normal boxes and 31 big boxes saved and didn‚Äòt got her, but didn‚Äòt got her
---
They're  criticizing the fact that SC just had to make us wait a few more days to release Max for no reason at all.
---
Beea
---
My boi is back :')
---
They always said that the limited skins come back once a year.
---
What's wrong? You have 1 and get 1000
---
Getting legendary being an f2p is abig deql
---
holy sht some showdown maps really could use this nice theme!
---
How?
---
Jesus thats unlucky, no joke, #relatable
---
ORA
---
I hope you take my word.
---
As a person with a disability, I find it very annoying the place of the brawlers button. I hope in the next update you will put it where it was.
---
I hold my phone with both hands and never one hands, and when I try to push the button, my left hand hurts, not a lot, but it matters, and the more and more I switch brawler the longer the pain is.
---
I hope you understand and in the next update I don't need to stretch my right thumb just to press on the brawler to switch to another one.
---
The new maps have too many animations for my phone to handle. I need to get a new one but that doesn't help me right now. I doubt I'm even getting 30 FPS.
---
Feast or famine was my favourite map, big F
---
Wow cool bug
---
But chance goes up
---
no way i pulled spike a couple days ago too
---
Heist isn't fun anymore. The old maps were amazing. But the new ones suck. Same with showdown.
---
Is it sad that im more likely to open sandy then max?
---
Cuuuuuute :)
---
I agree I wanna have it permanent

i play from scotland :D
---
How disappointed are your parents, I mean... imagine disliking brawl ball. Nonce behaviour imo but to each their own. Stinky bumda
---
We call Barley as "Bombardino"
---
I am not sure if that is true or not but i think it happens when u hit play again
---
I would definetly buy him if he would be sold for gems.
---
sandy is triggered.
---
Look at the sub enyone has this its normal dummy
---
r/TheBrawlStarsCactus
---
I can smell you through this post. Take a shower you stinky person
---
You say true! Split Second, Corner Case, Bridge too far, Excel, Dry Season, Double Truble, Critical Crossing etc.. Supercell always delete amazing maps and add suck maps!!!!!! The Only fun Showdown maps now are the Brawloween maps!
---
1 word describes it all.
---
SuperSell :(
---
Me who doesn't even have all the super rares yet :(
---
Congrats!
---
It's not a glitch
---
defeat :p

ismin g√ºzel ve iyi bulmussun onu :p
---
If this is real, god it‚Äôs amazing!
---
Wait, you mean Karis Diamond, right?
---
Imagine being exclusive for those who had ricochet before the remodel
---
then join mine its called mini neon and kts the only club that got this name
---
I made this comment before it was revealed we only have to wait 3 days. Only reason I can think of now is to make more money off those people mass opening their boxes
---
r/TIHI
---
I prefer buying multiple 10k skins instead of one gold skin. But still, congrats!
---
Excuse me what the fuck? xD
---
The showdown maps now are just blocks, grass, And other stuff thrown in random places
---
N O R M A L
---
B O X
---
Okay, this actually might be real!
---
100% confirmed that if you hit PLAY AGAIN the next match will switch camar angle to North to south or upside down position. Unplayed 10 matches just fine by NOT hitting play again. On the 10th match I hit play again and came to my findings.
---
You know you shouldn't be complaining right?
---
Everyone moves slower (thanks to being harder to move in water), but they reload faster? I like the concept but there needs to be something unique about it
---
Guys idk should I buy secret agent colt (cuz I like the effects) or Corsair colt (cuz he looks dope), which one?
---
It isn't fair for the people's who played in 2019.We will always have star shelly.
---
Yup also had it several times, but the replays have it normal.
---
This is so well made!
---
Bats people, duh
---
Not at all dude

Rico is 2 year old because hes been in the game for 2 years so

Rip. The time you could do that I was too noob to do that and I had no friends to play with. (I still haven‚Äôt I only play with randoms+solo)
---
Same, it even happens that someone rushes to a cube and dies immediatly after
---
He still went to the gym tho :‚Äô) our boi didn‚Äôt give up!
---
Cool thanks! I'll get my own game footage tho as it is your property
---
Which system are you talking about?
---
I‚Äôm wondering where u got this from, is it in the files?
---
#True!
---
Why did I say that in Poco‚Äôs voice. It sounded so cool in my head
---
Yup 99% likely
---
Congrats! That must‚Äôve taken a really long time to achieve !
---
Personally I love Penny so that‚Äôs who I‚Äôd go with. Choose whoever you play the most

Yeah i dont understand it either, all the teammates i get in insane II are completly braindead. I still havent been able to beat it.
---
Had the same thing happen

First though: "Glitch or feature?"
---
Damn you lucky boy
---
I  want to Bring back all of remived maps (G.G. Corral too), but my favourite was the HOT MAZE!!!!!!
---
Oooooooo,  wry nice!
---
F. I only opened a couple, but my brain was like "Hol' up!!"
---
I hope not.. it needs a patch
---
What kind of stuff is he serving?
---
Thanks üëç
---
Honestly, who CAN resist that tho?
---
Thats the brawl stars community!
---
Fits on a plate
---
Maps?
---
If you're talking about low trophy brawlers then it's because it now orioritizes matching you up with people with similiar globak trophy count instead of brawler trophies, imo it's a positive change
---
Idk but Frank said that people were not enjoying life leach
---
That doesn‚Äôt help. With 17 maps of each game mode, each map would still only be played about once a month.
---
ok boomer. get gud
---
I would spend every gem for that skin
---
She looks fat here
---
I dont interested! So they remove 2-3 not 10!!!!
---
It's the new update. I don't like it either, it's really confusing and gives you a disadvantage. In brawl ball the screen zooms even to the wrong goal if any team scoores a goal!
---
[deleted]
---
In case you didn't know, brawl stars was supposed to be set in outer space even before the beta came out in July 2017. So I guess they're making a use of the concepts that were made at that time.
---
It is decent grammar and funny meme you deserve an upvote
---
I don't really get what the difference would be? They are still seasonal skins that came out in 2018. Even if they stayed as "2018 brawlidays skin" I would still expect them to come back every year during the limited time event.
---
This post should be NSFW because they have bulges and its very visible.
---
One of the reasons I stopped was that the spotlights started becoming too similar and dipped in quality as I made more of them. I also lost interest in the game after trophy inflation, but I'm kinda interested in it again.   
---
Glad you found these informative, hopefully I'll be able to continue making more of these without a dip in quality.
---
You can see that frank spawned on top, beacuse his shield is still activated
---
It was the map where i made a big part of my trophies with colt F
---
Dyba
---
Yes because having the same maps over and over is boring
---
r/engrish
---
Congratulations!
---
Omg this is hilarious.
---
For SHIETS SAKE STAAAAAHP
---
He is one of the most versatile brawlers in the game and arguably the strongest legendary
---
I mean i have golden Rico so I would still use him
---
Yes, this happened to me in brawl ball
---
Why did i sort by new today @ - @
---
You said true
---
They changed it
---
Dyna
---
Today is just not your day :P
---
It's not like I don't want to believe you, I can't, because I have never seen it, heard of it or experienced it.
---
Just look, I don‚Äôt know, at the ENTIRE SUBREDDIT???
---
Shut up!
---
Oh and there are more glitches
---
How did he get this?????
---
If we were to remove 3 from each - meaning 14 maps for each game mode - then each map would come up every 28 days (4 weeks), which is still almost once a month. 
---
The only way to fix this is to remove a large amount of the maps, which is what Supercell did here.
---
Lol get good even with noob teammates you can still carry and win if you check the stats, bb is one of the most played game modes in the game. Just cuz you don‚Äôt know how to score doesn‚Äôt mean other people don‚Äôt like the mode
---
Water in water in the upper right corner.
---
how is it an anti noob version. Explain to me. Plz. Enlighten me.
---
Oh thank you!
---
Its unreleased right now
---
Reboot your phone
---
Took me 1 lol
---
the best solution would be to frequently change the map rotations....like one season you get this pack of maps (for every mode of course) and the next you would get another one...this would most likely not just satisfy most, but it would keep the meta fresh...er...kinda
---
Jessie and emz are pretty solid
---
Ahhh will it come out?
---
Gotta mow the lawn
---
Of course
---
Its a bug nearly everyone experiences it
---
True
---
I do it with Poco is that ok
---
That is definitely a great team comp! Personally, I do not think Coiled Snake has a lot of importance here, but it definitely does help!   
---
I agree with the last part of Primo's SP. I too feel that Meteor Rush is a better Star Power in this mode.
---
OMG when
---
Yes they made a mistake. As you‚Äôve probably seen, he‚Äôs made a post about it
---
No u
---
Possibly. A lot of my November datamine is in this update
---
We figured it out supercell you cant hide the OG thing from us
---
I can speak english –Ω–æ —è –≤–∏–∂—É —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ –±—É–∫–≤—ã –Ω–∞ –ø–æ—Å—Ç–µ
---
WHAT THE FUDGE IS THAT
---
No idea. It‚Äôs all server side and may not even be in this update
---
This is a big box. He even got gold and starpoints which you also can't get from small box when you pull a brawler/starpower.
---
Also, they screenshot is really old and I don't know if they changed something about boxes since beta.
---
Can I say this was a skin idea I had? [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/avkcxb/pool_rico_skin_concept_in_honour_of_ricochet/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
HE YEETS IT ( Tks for commenting on my post!)
---
Because the actualization is big :v
---
I'm a guy :/
---
This is actually fine by me, we get to save a few more boxes before opening.
---
I dont know but maybe its free on 24th december
---
Normally, your team starts on the bottom, but this game started my team at the top. The loading screen before the match started way above the top of the ship, before lowering to focus on my team like usual, but it focused on the top.
---
Hopefully what‚Äôs your brawl stars ID
---
Literally you want to return an update, is stupid
---
No! Why problem is it? They can Make 2-2 slot for Bounty and Heist!
---
You got in a wrong hive bud
---
Not bad!
---
Stop complaining
---
Yeah but there has to be a 400+ trophy brawler in the match
---
Yeah, we pass the crown to you dude.
---
Maby he forgot to post it earlyer
---
That is kind of what they‚Äôre doing, though. They just released a bunch of new maps, meaning that there‚Äôll be a new map rotation. 
---
I understand that you may rather have all the maps be changed, but, like you said, I‚Äôd prefer it if only some of them would change.
---
God dam right
---
Lucky you, i‚Äòm a guy too and i would love it if someone would call me sister
---
robot escanor
---
Yea supercell should just delay their updates and make sure there are no bugs
---
This is hard if players have healing supers or abilities
---
ok ok...
---
It's more filled with posts like this than the actual posts you are saying in the meme. Smh.
---
My highest is 17k but I never bought a star point skin, i may have bought a few boxes....Power play also helped out with a total of 10k star points over 3 seasons...honestly anyone can get a gold skin with some patience ;)
---
I checked, I am the first.

It should be at least to 16,000 trophies now that three more brawlers have been added (Emz, Bea and Max)

14k not a single legendary

just had this same glitch
---
They dont change. Only legendary drop rate changes

There is one

Yes poor frank

Lowkey I think this has to do with why they‚Äôre waiting three days to release Max. They see what bugs appear in the update and when Max comes out they add bug fixes

You know how usually respawn at the bottom of the map, ever since this update I've been glitching out a lot and respawning at the top of the map for some reason
---
Nice job!

I noticed as well! Opened a bunch of boxes than in one the last boxes the 1 was glowing ! Got beaaaaa
---
Poopie tara

I absolutely love present plunder. They could change the name to just capture the flag, change the present to a flag, and boom it's not festive exclusive any more. Super fun game mode. Rotating in the brawl ball spot sounds perfect. Great idea dude!

Wait old Rico is coming back

---

I‚Äôm really sorryüò¢

petition to bring back feast or famine
---
I just want to refund the santa mike I accidentally bought
---
true, they are just recoloring the plain one now
---
Why did you show me that?
---
Legacy Rico! It‚Äôs probs gonna be like how star Shelly was only available before 2019
---
So now I‚Äôve played 2 games with this guy, randomly chosen twice when I pressed play. Throughout the whole game, he was just standing still and in intervals he attacked, didn‚Äôt even flinch a bit. I was dumb enough to stop the recording a bit too early because he automatically pressed play again instantly. So it made me wonder if it was some type of bot?
---
That's why I say I'd want Supercell to create the games so everybody is inverted.  I could go for 50/50 inverted or normal, as long as everybody was inverted at the same time.  Everyone would then have the same handicap.
---
Yes... It appears that Rico has Risen, friend.
---
Right!

I'm on Android 9 and icon still looks cropped.
---
N they say supercell isn't giving out more stuff
---
Bug.
---
Still not fixed for me
---
Ok sorry
---
ANDROID 9 IS ALSO A GRANDMA FELLAS
---
Same it‚Äôs gets very annoying and I hope they do a mini maintenance update
---
This matches what happens when you played as Frank in the Mortis Mortuary environment
---
Congrats!! I opened 6 boxes but my brain was like "Wait, I think the update summary said Max isn't out yet," and I stopped. Now saving 44 regular, 7 Big, and my 12k Mega. I think I'll get Bea or a Star Power, but Max or a Legendary might come instead.
---
I agree that sandy is awesome, by ruined I more so meant in the minds of people because of the similarities and being released close in time, Not like actually lol didn‚Äôt do a good job of explaining that ü§ô

I love THICCO

Jesus Christ it didn't get like a 1000 upvotes or something ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Just letting ppl know alrighty?
---
¬øItalian lenguage?
---
Call it loot plunder
---
YES
---
surely there were more than dozens right??
---
Since global for me
---
I lost count
---
I doubt some players would see this message as they would think they are the first to spot the glitch and immediately post it..
---
wdym?
---
Where i can see the old model?
---
Since 1st year of beta
---
Tried this on ipad and iphone. Still loads my gf‚Äôs account.
---
it‚Äôs exactly this attitude why gambling is so fucking dangerous lol
---
I was just about to post about it too until I saw urs. I'm so fricking excited to have the old Ricochet back!
---
It won't get you banned since this isn't the model for the 1 year anniversary gift Ricochet
---
The problem is you're not the only one who did. When it floods the subreddit with the same post it means other non-repetitive content doesn't get viewed
---
That just happened to me in a brawl ball game
---
Money and boxes
---
It's possible ya ik it's wierd but it's an Australia meme.  Also,  when it's loading scrolling down from the top you cans see the void
---
u/Ryan_SuperCell
---
I've been playing for longer. Like the soft launch for Android longer. Back when everyone had their OG models. AND RICO IS GETTING HIS BACK!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! U have no idea how excited I am about this
---
What kinda bullshit is this.
---
Definitely not. No one has posted about it yet.
---
she is like frank, dangerous in the right hands
---
I like this map a lot. Great job.
---
That was fun
---
Yeah exactly
---
I hope so. That would be so cool
---
I don't have a skin for either and I like both brawlers, so which do you guys think has cooler animations/effects?
---
I don't know about u, but I play better that way ü§£ I want this to be a setting u can change to enhance ur playing style
---
no one cares but ok
---
Man this was before GENE and he was added in FEBRUARY
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs a mode that Mortis does so well in! We need to play it enough that they consider making it permanent
---
Since when did geri kor make skins?
---
omg yes had it about 10 times but only in brawl ball
---
Just don't hit play again if u really don't like it. Me on the other hand fricking love it!
---
laughs in iphone
---
For me there‚Äôs still a space
---
Ew no
---
Not bad, but I have a tip for shading. If you shade with black like that, you ruin the colours you are working with, makes one side harder to see instead of looking shaded in, and in general, doesn‚Äôt look as good.
---
Try looking up a shading guide and using that, it complements the colours you are working with, makes your drawing look more realistic, and will make the shading look more natural.
---
I hope this helped!
---
i'm planning to buy pirate poco but don't know if i could buy santa mike or lil helper penny (i have 78 gems)
---
Wow Its Removed Because Its Real
---
Bounty? Lone star? Maybe BB and duo showdown.
---
Actually he is there as u are playing with him ( that‚Äôs what she said)
---
What device are you using and what are the specs?
---
Just look at new you'll see tons of posts of that
---
Dude the picture makes it 13x funnier

Just saw Frank_Supercell‚Äôs postüòÇnvm
---
Shut up bitch
---
Dude......thanks for helping save the mods heist, it was desperately in need of better maps
---
Because of your software's Icon Frame Shape
---
Its forcing the icon in there
---
Your brawlers ass it will never be in the game
---
git gud
---
go back to sleep sandy
---
but isn't it similar or the same as Ricochet and would this be a case like Star Shelly where it was only available to those who played before 2019
---
WHY IS EVERYTHING IN ALL CAPS
---
I tried to give Heist "Outlaw Camp" vibes, which I thought was an interesting idea. Lets see how it plays!
---
Bro this is exactly what I had in mind for Darryl‚Äôs voice!
---
But I feel that the voice should be a lot more prominent, as the quality of it kinda sounds off. But other than that, it‚Äôs amazing
---
imagine spinning to charge your super
---
- this post was made by max max gang
---
but u got 9 power cubes and ultimate....
---
I totally agree, but it can get annoying with very aggressive team compositions, such as Bull, El Primo and Rosa, which can‚Äôt be easily countered with most team comps such as Gene, Darryl and Bibi ( I just got destroyed with that comp, but it‚Äôs good) and the only way to balance high pick-rates of heavyweights is by having at least one member of the team defend the gift, so the game can be more than ‚ÄúI will just teamkill and score with El Primo‚Äù
---
It is similar but the they gave him a new model
---
They are posts about Ricochet skin so it won't get you banned
---
If there is no emz playing you can see his phone thrown away
---
I do indeed agree
---
Yes! It totally threw me off. I thought it was because I hit play again but then tried to exit.
---
I like it, looks fun for the og heist characters and also is unique looking
---
I started to play on last December too
---
The bug is actually kinda cool
---
I have a question if normal Bea shoot bee this Bea shoot human? I know I have mental problems
---
The brawlstars cactus at it again looking up women's skirts
---
Yes, i am Softhelilwitch
---
The real question is, will this turn my loaded Rico back into Golden Ricochet
---
btw supercell removed safe zone cause everyone was posting "safe zone or not so safe" everytime it comes in rotation xD
---
Hello
---
Exuseme but can you please delete my drawing?
---
You didn't ask me for upload it here
---
Ya we got kicked of a study room because we kept shouting eeeeeeel primooo
---
Even better fun fact, I got spike AND crow from my boxes
---
Removed and banned.
---
Dang it!
---
I wasn't looking and just predicted they both came out!
---
Didn't even get Bea, a star power, or enough gems for a mega box!
---
with what bluestacks?
---
It happened the same thigh to me, I think it was intentional to add variety
---
Saaaameee
---
Shes on that liquid weed
---
Come here georgie grab the trophy
---
Or hopefully include the actual attack range in brawler stats.
