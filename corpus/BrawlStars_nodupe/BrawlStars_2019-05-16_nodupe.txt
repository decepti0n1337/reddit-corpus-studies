Please holy god, pick me
---
---
---
I really hope they stabilize the servers in the next update and maybe add a ranked bracket so people who want to be more competitive can play against each other and dumb randoms can play together
---
I‚Äôm interested...
---
mortis shouldve been arguing with dynamike
---
~~Gedi Kor isn't the only artist here~~
---
In that case, she‚Äôs good on quite a few gem grab and heist maps, good in sole bounty maps, and good in many siege maps. HOWEVER, she does not need an attack buff. Her star power does need to be reworked but aside from that she‚Äôs relatively balanced.
---
Cool ¬≥
---
Wtf, they're ugly, the quality of their models don't fit within every other model.
---
New brawler on a hoverboard named Simon
---
The only problem with is Jesse is better at all those game modes except siege and I feel like that's a problem she is even good at brawl ball, and she has a faster attack speed, and her star power does something, and her turret can get consistently healed while doing some 400 damage
---
I'm super bad with Barley but when someone else uses him, he's super effective against me.
---
Hopefully a new game mode üòÉ
---
Snowflakes. You‚Äôre probably the people who got me banned for 2 days just cause my name was fa king ur mom
---
Wow
---
Ohhhh ok
---
oof im a global player üò•
---
i think the next update is gonna be a club thing. some competitive aspect to give to the clubs, and of course some 60s themed skins. gl everyone!
---
Not in bounty but in hesit/ some gem/ most siege
---

---
But again Jesse can do it better which is the problem
---
not really, we dont need it. Piper needs it the most cuz shes the one lacking details
---
r/helptara
---
I'm in!
---
I want this especially since I have Leon
---
NICE
---
Whenever i get a particularily nice teammate i do this
---
To bad its not the mortis with lipstick
---
This isüî•
---
Gatling Gull, the destroyer of worlds.
---
New update is most likely a new game mode!
---
name in game: *exists
---
yotubers: **NEW BRAWLER NAMED SIMON**
---
Dm me the bottom left pic, it‚Äôs for science
---
I agree 100%. Jessie is absolutely better than Penny. Even in siege, it‚Äôs basically a push. The only thing giving penny a slight advantage is the ability to sneak the mortar on the ike. But that‚Äôs nearly impossible at high levels because people are wise to it
---
Does Mortis now DIVOes to grab the first gem?
---
Go Team Spike! ‚ö°Ô∏èüåµ‚ö°Ô∏è
---
Next update will be a huge buff for Spike...I feel it! ü§ûü§ûü§û
---
Probably because jessie fits more into your playstyle. Penny has very different mechanics and can‚Äôt be used as a replacement as Jessie, so you can‚Äôt really compare the two.
---
[removed]
---
did you just spell ahegao face as ohayou?
---
yup
---
Finally another intellectual, #BuffPennySoSheCanBeBetterThanJesse
---
Yup, you gotta love making a Canadian Account to get it early!
---
Perfect a fluffy cucumber
---
The problem isn't they are OP, they are even underpowered. The problem is everything they add is a disadvantage to the one who got the bad RNG.
---
i dont get it
---
Crazy Jessie :)
---
Yes u can, only thing penny has over Jesse is 30 damage and a cannon which isn't the best against lots of bralwers
---
Didn‚Äôt we see a picture that showed the Mortis remodel along with the el primo remodel yet it never got released?
---
You don't get how this meme works. You arare saying one Rosa is called "O", and the second one is called " P", which makes no sense
---
Classic
---
A spike buff! :D
---
so true
---
Sadly... "This cannot be!" - Carl
---
A player gets tired is usually the cause while the enemy is still fresh at their game.
---
Carl
---
Balance changes...
---
This is dope!
---
His is my freind and nice :)
---
Reeeeeeeeee
---
Holy shit. The memories.
---
 I would love to win the spike and bag!
---
Ok the best name 
---
Dog
---
Just lift up the dress a *little* bit up
---
Spike is so cute
---
Charge your phone please
---
[deleted]
---
What software do you use?
---
I am
---
This is more of a country type of guitar. But at least it sounds good. It would be nice to know what the theme sounds like on different types of guitars.
---
Penny is a sharpshooter, she is meant to snipe people with her cannon at an insane range, along with her attack split. Jessie is to provide control with her bouncing attack and close range turret. Both are used very differently - don‚Äôt be confused by the fact that both have a turret. Penny does need a star power buff, but you seem to be thinking Penny is a bad brawler and that isn‚Äôt very true :)
---
I NEED that spike man. My 5 year old loves spike.
---
The force
---
this is a lot of comments lol
---
SHUDDUP
---
I know that was probably a little dramatic but still late game is lacking and unlocking brawlers is too random.
---
Hope I win
---
This is cool
---
BUFF MORTIS &gt;:v
---
Sweet
---
Thank you! Brawl hard!
---
I don‚Äôt get it. Can someone explain?
---
Hey creatures of the night!
---
üéµ **INTO THE FIRE**
---
If they buff his reload speed they will decrease his damage
---
How is this related?
---
prob a new broken character who will take a week to nerf
---
Thanks and good luck everyone!
---
It will be my first legendary
---
Sometimes you just gotta keep it simple. :)
---
A new map or a weird new brawler!
---
It depends on your comp
---
Snaps and there is a rosa with 302 power cubes with energy drink behind him
---
wanted to get that plush for my gf, but it‚Äôs sold out now /:
---
Ooh cool me
---
New skins
---
New brawlers?
---
He looks *tasty*
---
Hi
---
Hope I win, this looks super cool.
---
Some phones got smashed that day xD
---
Yuck night witch
---
cute spike
---
Really good job dude
---
That‚Äôs fine if it‚Äôs your favorite. But it‚Äôs very low skill compared to 3v3 games.
---
I got penny and piper in one big box!!!
---
Yep. All of the original brawlers have been remodeled except for piper, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong
---
Awesome stuff
---
*powercube
---
wow your a god for doing this man, the supercell shop is out of stock and spike has been my favorite  brawler ever since i got him from a megabox, the jessie and poco one looked kinda meh so i really wished to get one, hopefully i win this giveaway.
---
My brother has less trophies, plays less than me, and doesn‚Äôt even really like the game but still has better luck in getting more characters than I have
---
Probably a new mode and a new brawler
---
New skins, new map with minecart, minor balance changes.
---
#BRUH
---
It‚Äôs cool if it‚Äôs your favorite. But it‚Äôs a junk game mode. It rewards bad play. Bush camping. Teaming. Kill poaching. I can tell instantly when I get randoms who play showdown exclusively as teammates because they have no clue how to actually play.
---
an update about clubs? hopefully
---
Ok, will do. Do you have any more suggestions on how to promote your maps to try and get them in-game?
---
Spike is love, Spike is life
---
maybe both? üòÅ not so sure. Supercell hasn't really made any background stories for the characters. All I know is that Pam is Jessie's mom.
---
This is humor not a bug
---
Sorry! Wish I could share the updoots with you.
---
Why the HECK does this matter (not in a mean way just wondering if it affects anything in-game )
---
Teamwork for the win
---
Good but don't change anything
---
Maybe I'll do some modifications because I think you missed some parts haha
---
Uhhhh, why my pp hard
---
That's actually impressive
---
Too neon
---
I don‚Äôt know if Shelly is underage or not so you‚Äôre in a big grey area pal
---
‚ÄúOk one last ranked match‚Äù
---
Translate what???
---
WTF YO
---
#REMODEL LE PRIMO
---
Leon is not weak at all actually, but yea don‚Äôt just push Leon
---
This is not a bug. Supercell do it to prevent trophy exploiting. 
---
In old version you can play with low trophy player to get easy enemy, so you can push very easy .
---
Shelly should be in rosa's place
---
Love it
---
U would have lost trophies dumbass
---
Looks more like a skin
---
Thicc
---
# NO U
---
wow
---
Inside him
---
Leon is easy to dodge and count by 2 against him
---
Ayeeee. Looks great mate!
---
No really,I think it's a cool name.
---
Looks like barley‚Äôs skin
---
:')
---
thanks man, and sadly not a lot of people are familiar with THE Eagles ...
---
SC has 0 creativity however
---
As√≠ me gusta
---
2 things.
---
1. The creators of EndGame put a one week ban on only spoilers, it's long been lifted and people and make memes and other funny stuff with pictures from the film.
---
2. He even photoshopped or had to find a no spoiler picture to make this meme. 
---
3 ( extra ). If you don't like getting spoiled, just go watch he fucking movie, you had enough time, don't be mad that others are making memes about it because you can't spend 1 day off to watch an amazing movie that you want to see.
---
Don't worry I love teaming!
---
(My flare at Tara gang is BACKSTABing Tara
---
&gt;you're just assuming that i got emotional. like seriously? and looks like you never heard of "opinions".
---
So your opinion proves that Shelley needs a nerf?
---
So if I disagree, then Shelley needs a buff?
---
It's your words against mine. That's why I use facts and data rather than my opinion, otherwise we get nowhere. Emotions have no part in this, just because you "feel" something is OP doesn't mean anything.
---
True
---
Couldn‚Äôt you have just screenshotted it rather than taking a whole ‚Äònother photo on a different device? It would‚Äôve been a lot easier.
---
Idk. Seems like it's in their favor as they can dish out more damage for the few seconds they did survive more than you.
---
Thanks!
---
It is a fricken( paseball hat )
---
What ever happened to never give up. When ur being chased you can still try instead of just give up.   I like this idea.
---
Wow im learning french since 4 years and english since 7 years and german is my motherlanguage lel
---
You made my heart stop lol
---
Bro its a meme template for BS memes,edit and done,u just placed it for free edit
---
No, it is a meme template. Unrelated to the game or SC
---
it wouldve been a spoiler if i would have showed the actual picture
---
Thanks man!
---
No problem
---
How dare you make a joke serious... actually NVM. Flair checks out lol
---
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢???
---
Maybe next?
---
How dare you be the average reddit cuck user.
---
Took me a lil while to realise Leon was facing the other way...
---
Just sayen üòÜ
---
Buff Frank
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Sometimes your enemy might be your ally
---
Because it's an old model that looks unpolished and not up to par with the remodeled brawlers
---
Do you want me to add him to the list?
---
I had that happen. It annoys me to the point of,    ‚Äú why play when your just pissing off others bc you think it‚Äôs funny‚Äù.
---
Bro With the meme called "let me in"ppl i saw was doing edits placing BS characters,shut up saying that i need be banned from the chat by a  single post

She needs to feel like she decided to stop playing herself. As it sounds harsh you have to make her feel bad for playing. Speak about her friends - if she has lost some she will think about it. Maybe even tell her she have gained some weight because she is playing all day. She needs to feel like she made the decision. If you or your family try to make her stop she wont.

The best meme I‚Äôve seen this whole year
---
Wrong kind of Spanish
---
Happy 10 yrs Aniversary!
---
The theme actually plays when your in a game. They did this awhile back cuz beta players missed the old theme.
---
Would be interesting if they made it so that nobody respawns at all though...
---
Mkay... You want a mechanism to prevent a legitimate way of playing duo showdown... why?
---
Gene is not op
---
Bring back cavern churn

It'll be better if we could have an opportunity to choose power points to 3 brawlers we want like in clash royale

Why ur mom big hole

I know they will balanced it between child friendly and original model like with bo.

And with Shelly's super.

Even a power 1 Shelly.

I think it has something to do with the update right

At least Mortises kill dynamikes easily

Nah that‚Äôs a southern American accent, She‚Äôs probably from Louisiana since that state has a strong French influence during America‚Äôs history
---
Haha I bought them all....ALLL
---
Pay to winners are more retarded in my experience. The Leons always get cocky and get their ass whooped.
---
Yes that‚Äôs me I‚Äôve gotten top comment twice now
---
Ummmm so if we want to say stop teaming. We need to say we need more powercubes?
---
Yea
---
STOP
---
That must be having a hard time
---
Mortis killing dyna
---
I guess nerf wasn't enough......
---
She so thick the earth shakes when she walks. Is pam big chungus? Who knows

I thought it was impossible? The first few boxes are predetermined to not have legendarys.

I thought all your tea was in the harbour

Lol, he isnt that weak if you play him right. I managed to get him to 470 trophies on soloshowdown with power7.
---
I think he's a good solo brawler but in most times a not so good teambrawler
---
realized that too xD can't change title anymore sorry. But 11 is impressive enough for you? ;)

I got power 6 rosa to 300 and I'm stuck 
---
I'm generally bad with melee brawlers
---
You will need them if a new brawler comes out.
---
I say no, it wouldn't be a good idea because crow is annoying enough to even kill
---
Anyone at r/punpatrol is gonna have an aneurysm reading this lmao
---
Sheolt
---
WHY DO YOU THINK HE SAYS, ‚ÄúHERE BIRDY BIRDY?‚Äù
---
It's a "meme" here in Brazil, cause Portugal colonized us, but we became a continental country, and the biggest country who speaks portuguese. So it's became "Brazilian" language
---
Boii you can use him however you like, but go near a bush camper... you finna die
---
Well he is level 10, but I climbed to where I am at 7, and reached power level 10 after.
---
That's not so nice to say, Rico has a name.
---
He is only good in showdown. I know. He is not good in team fights. That is my problem. I play a lot with friends and they urge me to play crow since I am the only one in my group who has him. I am currently at 516 with power 8.
---
WHAAT?!
---
My point is he is currently balanced, but he doesn‚Äôt feel as good because of his difficulty to play
---
The carrier on my team taunted at the enemy goal too long and it cost us the game
---
Hit it from the back
---
You are so right

Look at literally everything you said, you dunce. If auto aim on throwers is ‚Äúuseless‚Äù changing it to not be useless is a buff
---
Ngl I wanna watch the video
---
Furthermore, it also buffs barley and dyna by increasing resistance to close range brawlers
---
This meme is so old, why people keep remind us that mortis can easily defeat dynamike with the same old meme?
---
Maybe its saying it has the shortest as it always dies an early death around us hoomins

What doesn't it effect?

BTW it effects nothing

That memes brawlstars takes almost everything from here

he‚Äôs not meant to do that

Lol ur mad that I pointed out that you made a bad tier list lmao
---
People are doing this on purpose right now.
---
im really confusedvis that satire?
---
Being mythical doesn‚Äôt link to the power/damage of the brawler
---
r/woooosh

This better be a huge ass update
---
New 2v2 gamemode

Since she can't tell it verbally... *PlEaSe GiVe TaRa A vOiCe*.

Still mortis should be a lower ratity

Is this a joke and all funny or are you stealing u/gedi_kor‚Äôs work ?

I must see this skin in game!

Por eso dije "Potenciales" : Aun asi hay probabilidades de que 2 o 3 brawlers aparezcan con mas cajas de la cuenta

I really enjoy when you team with somebody to kill them and then they insta kill you. #StopTheSpin

As soon as you hit 1 shoot on someone, they‚Äôre basically forced to back off :p

Wow, thanks! What game mode should I make next?
---
No you aren't
---
Carl must have taken the "Rock" out of "Rockstar"
---
Thank you! I couldn't have done it without you :D
---
My second-highest rated post ever. I guess I should stick to gaming memes, though I guess my other one could barely be considered a meme.
---
Oh look at this rico and Mortis
---
_______________ ricK and mortY
---
I am how Dare you
---
Shes actually around 16... But I made her little olderüòÅ. Now she's like 18+
---
More Club features! Maybe that's where the diner comes in? A new game mode called food fight! And a new brawler with an aztec theme - a masked voodoo girl called Maya.
---
I see this as an absolute win!

Global players: WaIt Who Is tHaT gUy?!

Yes i wonder too
---
oh thanks i get  it now
---
Best comment ever
---
Cool, but why? Can‚Äôt you just buy power points from the shop already? It doesn‚Äôt need to be a box, if it only contains one thing
---
It‚Äôs funny cause everyone loves Leon....
---
It‚Äôs also very well done. 
---
Try doing Frank?
---
what is special about this box?
---
He wasted the super
---
This is an unreliable way to dodge since the sniper bot doesn't shoot 100% accuracy. It's a good way but you won't dodge all the shots.
---
He wasted the super rrr
---
It‚Äôs the old model idk
---
Yeah I noticed this too. I rushed to get by Brawl Ball token at 5minutes to.
---
I don't want to stir things up, but maybe it's a sign they're working on the siege game mode or an update is around the corner?
---
&amp;#x200B;

lmao i love how everyone things max brawlers mean pay to win. i‚Äôm  at 9k and i have 7 brawlers maxed. does things mean i‚Äôm p2w?
---
Well not really
---
I'm not gonna complain...
---
He‚Äôs over 500
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
r/lootstars
---
Ya no i don‚Äôt have an issue with it, I just think it‚Äôs really odd
---
I thought it was 0 at 5 above 500
---
Over 600, 500+ would be 0
---
The dumb player(shelly) that play with out playing with brain
---
50 power points? I think that‚Äôs a little too much
---
Damn you guys are fast
---
It is just a card, don't tell me you actually think that everything that has the word ,,brawler'' means it is a new brawler in the game?
---
Nevermind 
---
https://twitter.com/frank_supercell/status/1129025318268882944?s=21
---
3 big boxes would give less value tho, as that‚Äôs the same as 9 smol boxes.
---
I also agree that Morris needs a slight range buff apart from that he is a great brawler got gem grab even siege if played with a team that you know
---
i do. u upset?
---
Tell Leon not me I think he will be disappointed but tell em
---
Can u link me to it
---
I know I was playing in 2017
---
Stop suggesting cool things that you want to PAY for.
---
Quoting u/frank_supercell:  
---
"Yes, we exceptionally have Brawl Ball instead of Siege today due to an event we are supporting. Sorry if it caused you any inconvenience. "
---
everyone replying to this shows me we don‚Äôt need siege/brawl ball to change. just anything else and keep those two modes. lol
---
r/cursedbrawlstars
---
Thot
---
No
---
That would work for sure
---
The last second was insane

Now, this is epic and %100 OC

Haha

This is next level retarded

ahhh so cuteeee

Rip colt

Fakts my fellow morti

Brawl balls is my favourite, siege is too risky for me

How many trophies do you have?

Sorry I Didn't Make This Template But That Would Be Correct
---
5370 currently, only been playing a few months.
---
Like don‚Äôt get me wrong but listen to the other ideas people have for new game modes CAPTURE THE FLAG (I came up with this and haven‚Äôt heard or seen anyone else say it)OR LIKE DODGE BALL, PAINT BALL, and other interesting game modes
---
Also I'm part if 0.2% of brawl stars players
---
I quit this game some time ago but enjoy the memes
---
Ur probably lower 1000 trophies
---
I got Crow when i have 500 trophies
---
And Leon when i have 1200
---
I‚Äôve honestly thought about making some kind of CAPTURE THE FLAG game type but would need help from a couple other people to plan out how it would work and such üòÇ but honestly that sounds wayyyyyyyyy more fun than siege and just another good mode to play once you‚Äôre done trick shoting in brawl ball
---
No, i have 2700 and He is still anoying
---
Yea ok I just wanted to make all of them have a different style
---
He is one of the WORST brawlers
---
What does that mean
---
Yes, just unlocked Penny .
---
Okay, I usually don't like the fan art.  But this... this right here is something I want to see more of.
---
Shitposters
---
Plus you guys are systematically nerfing the legendary characters - which makes them just hard to get normies.  
---
Leon is basic now.
---
üòÇ
---
Crossover announcements happen a lot if you play the other supercell games. Remember the Shelly, Bo, and I forgot was in Clash Royale.
---
Also, I tagged the post with humor
---
Bruh, you didnt make this, you just downloaded a leon image and pixalated it with photoshop!
---
It ain't just in solo it's in it all
---
Half of this sub are kids, so it‚Äôs really awkward when it comes to stuff like this.
---
Should probably stop teaming, but its the only way of gaining trophies in BS, sooo
---
Totally agree.  Its perfect
---
YES BAN THEM PLEASE SUPERCELL!!!
---
You should make a wall breaker from COC as a barely skin
---
As a US Marine myself, I NEVER team with the enemy...but that's just me.
---
That's the Leaked video of Colt falling on Bulls Bar. 
---
Brawl Talk is on May 20
---
Perfectly balanced, as all thing should be...
---
Obviously not seeing as the Shelly who wasn‚Äôt teaming won? Ahaha. Get good
---
IIIIIOOOOOOO EEEOOOOO EO EO EO
---
It Ain't Them memes if it's real
---

---
You know the sad thing about this is the fact that I have more trophies than you

Sweet victory you got there
---
First of all I don‚Äôt like u because you‚Äôre a teamer. Second of all they only spawn near/on players that aren‚Äôt grouped up
---
So basically,  people with this before their name team together in showdown.
---
It's a teaming prefix
---
Poco.  Brawl Stars needs more good Poco users
---
Yup
---
True, it‚Äôs now even easier to get the tokens with randoms than with friends with the new matchmaking... (at 500+ tr)
---
Brawl stars official tweeter!??
---
sure, thank you
---
You team as well sadly
---
 good job üëç

No I don‚Äôt

I am not against bushes ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Thank you

No it's impossible to buy or get another until you used it all
---
Hell yeah showin' some love for our girl!

I don‚Äôt play often. And I enjoy playing the game as it‚Äôs intended. When I play solo showdown I understand the ‚Äúsolo‚Äù means I‚Äôm all alone. Every man for himself. There are people with 10x my trophies, I don‚Äôt care. I would rather be lower trophy rating knowing I‚Äôve pretty much earned them all myself (I‚Äôve been paired with amazing teammates from time to time on the game modes that give you a team and been carried) then to be higher trophy rating but teamed with players in solo showdown. So brag all you want about how many you have, just remember you had to team to get there.
---
Maybe you were teaming. 
---
If you weren't ,then I'm sorry for you
---
It means that you belong in r/engrish.
---
Also siege is trash
---
It's not really worth to buy Big and Mega Boxes
---
This has a resemblance to my meme üëå
---
You're welcome.  I hope you play him and get good with him. I've tried and tried and just can't seem to get the hang of him. But when I play with randoms in 3v3, I absolutely love it when we have a good Poco on our side!
---
What a miracle! So does this mean something against the update?
---
can you also dm me?  
---
i would like to be able to do this just one time to test
---
Well unfortunally you will almost always lose trophies when you dont team in solo showdown, but thats not necesarry when you have gotten low trophie brawlers, like you
---
Spend your money on tickets not boxes. Plus you already have Spike.
---
Reducing her range accomplishes that. Her range is what makes her seem so much faster than she is. She‚Äôs the same speed as bull. But it seems like she‚Äôs way faster because she has such a good reach.
---
Wut u talking about I‚Äôm 10K ?
---
People probaply just get annoyed when their 10th level dude dies in 3 seconds
---
need to get rid of seige anyway, such an annoying game type
---
#FBI OPEN UP
---
I said that at 1K he got a legendary like nothing
---
No bulls speed is quicker than most brawlers, so she can catch up slowly to most brawlers, combined with her tankynes and range shes just to strong
---
Excuse me what the fuck
---
Seems like crow added some weight to his chin. I wonder how much beers has he drank.
---
Now thats hillarious.
---
Can you dm me too? I‚Äôm interested
---
A lot!!! :)
---
Corners of the eyes?
---
I think they are adding a letter every day and after 3 days it will make up "RETROPOLIS" I think.
---
_Why is he so FAT?_
---
Wow Mortis voice speeded up is the creepiest thing I've ever heard
---
Tf does copied even mean??
---
You still stole this..
---
But that's just a redo of an older fanart
---
Please don't. I like earning Star Tokens.

That hurts

Great! This is very informative and helped a lot! Thanks!
---
Cool
---
Thank you dani. What a helpful lad.
---
I know. But that‚Äôs because he‚Äôs short range. He needs the speed to close or escape from ranged brawlers. Rosa does too. And the speed difference is at most .2 tiles per second. So it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs running people down with ease. We agree she needs a nerf. I just don‚Äôt believe reducing her speed is the right nerf.
---
No let it be, it's better this way
---
Ok I gues
---
That's not true!
---
......ok yeah it's true.
---
stop trying to put out the fire on a sinking ship you arrogant shit.
---
Star Tara!
---
Not as op as energy drinks
---
How does he shoot when he is carrying gems with both hands?
---
Hold on a minute I've seen this skin once like 1-2 mounths ago. Did you stole it ?
---
Cool, Thanks for the suggestion
---
Retro pop? That would mean it's dropping tomorrow.
---
D
---
Sorry for the long title lol
---
Just dont give rosa her super in the first place.
---
About as serious as a death threat from a 13 year old can be. So yeah not that serious.
---
I mean everyone is asking but I'm also kinda instrested
---
That would be lit. It‚Äôs ‚Äúchest‚Äù amazing
---
*whole, and gene already sort of stuns brawlers, its when he pulls them. I think his star power isn't the worst, but if it changed I'd like a +300 damage to his super like he used to.
---
Brawlstats shows the rank of the current trophies count. Not the highest achieved
---
It's just RNG
---
How are you not tempted to use that super?!
---
I did not do bro
---
Just a meme, Im over 5k trophies
---
Why are you wasting your super on those jumps that go nowhere, hit no one, and break nothing (important)? 0.o
---
Really isn't but has a high skill cap. Good if you know how to use him. (did you get first by teaming?)
---
R u stupid?
---
Eat this gem
---
Klaar
---
No it's not always
---
Its dutch
---
So the one at the beginning was just to make sure the piper didnt hit me while the one at the end was just a mispress
---
I thought about it first but i didn‚Äôt want to be a dickhead and ruin the party
---
Ikr, some people want a health buff im like tf
---
Is this map larger than usual? Even so, it's a great map!
---
what are you doing on the BS subreddit?
---
look at them... all bunched together &gt;.&gt;
---
Wym you literally reposted a picture from u/GEDI-KOR
---
SIEGE IS TRASH
---
Perfectly balanced as all things should be
---
if you triple the tickets you won't get anything else
---
Yep, can clearly see on the word Dynamique. Brazillian is like portoguese
---
Easier to lose trophies for normal accounts as well.
---
Pam torture
---
the people who think this guy is serious are stupid
---
Basic stats.  Each box is a 1% chance. That doesn't mean that you will get one in 100 boxes. It means that even opening 10,000,000 boxes, you still have just 1% chance each time you open a box
---
Its so good make crow
---
Damm i thought of that too
---
Nah idc about losing its my mini acc
---
Too empty
---
 True but you are chosen to play üòÖ
---
Wasnt sure if it was me or not. Damn thats sucks.
---
English speaking sub buddy
---
Well now you just made me do it to... How do I unsee all this?
---
u/cryptosyringe is the new u/DariusBrawlStars
---
I love barley tbh. I did even so even more when his super could stack. But now Dynamike is kind of a direct upgrade to Barley, so yeah he is UP rather than OP imo. And also, it isn't my post so your question about me teaming is irrelevant. :D
---
They‚Äôre supposed to stay with people who aren‚Äôt near each other. I‚Äôve seen countless videos where people win because of this, but I guess they just hate me :(
---
Im a nita main and shes very probably the character i see the least, 1 in 50 matches or something like that.
---
You are probably using a meta brawler like rosa that everyone else is using so its probably why
---
Water lets you shoot someone without them getting closer. It benefits long-range brawlers like bushes benefit short-range.
---
Wtf is this gamemode lmao
---
And the problem is?
---
Yeah I understand the probably it just baffles me. I got Colt and barley star power in &lt;10 boxes. I guess the whole probability thing is everyone's go to frustration anyway
---
It will probably happen as new brawlers get added to the game, like it did for clash royale
---
k then
---
Theese people doing this to get more atention.They are know what they are doing they are know that they are toxic thats what they want.Dont talk about them dont care about them and they will give up.
---
Thorn bush is basically like spikes super
---
She'd gain health every time she gets hit
---
So its not a fact?
---
Officer, I'd like to report this comment right here

why do you want to ban such a nice guyÔºüsacrificing his own trophy to help othersÔºåthis guy is an angleÔºÅyou are the one should be banned for being so selfish

Nicely drawn Penny
---
GEDI-KOR made that skin
---
I can say brawl ball is better than siege and thats a fact
---
But i know thats just an opinion
---
Thought to take them a few years ahead, that's why jey look a bit older.  
---
In retrospect, perhaps I could have given Bull a little more grizzle and gray hair, great idea!
---
The cracked blocks seem like a decent idea. The shield and hole I don't approve of. Plus, brawl stars is kinda boring right now with the meta. This could at least spice things up a little. And how complicated are bridges and breakable blocks? The fact that you think a bridge is too complicated seens weird to me
---
This is from a russian mod.Lol
---
Selviytymisaneera
---
Yeah it is but he actually says piece of work or wak??
---
I love it. Lol.
---
I think smoker would fit better as an ability, maybe a new character‚Äôs super. Also, if you fall into water from a bridge, you should take damage.
---
That is awesome
---
Oh this is great
---
Best comment ever... Take this

Sorry I didn't know an idea like this existed
---
My old concept in my profile
---
It's in the rotation. One time theres siege one time theres brawl ball...
---
I would definitely like to see more game mechanics like this

Close your app and reload.

Isn‚Äôt that a good thing?

They should put it in the game its fantastic

Is java and javascript different

Gotta support my fellow crow. We are legion.

r/theydidthemonstermath
---
This is a Victory Royale
---
I respect your opinion but "siege is trash" sounds like a fact
---
Maybe "I hate siege" or "Siege is trash in my opinion" or whatnot is a opinion
---
Primo trash, spike is the way to go
---
OMG YEAH
---
I really like all but the hole. Imagine lagging and you walk in
---
Please tell me you didn‚Äôt count all of the power cubes...
---
Yeah my Colt is pretty tilted because of that
---
Do you have other suggestions for brawlers other than mortis so I can make the outlines then color them later
---
That was amazing
---
When is there gonna be an new update
---
Thank you!
---
Still happening to me almost one game out of 2. Very frustrating.
---
I really don‚Äôt like that idea it wouldn‚Äôt be brawl stars with those
---
Frank
---
Frank is the next brawler on the list after Pam then goes Darryl then colt then mortis do you have suggestions for other brawlers
---
Iron blocks, thorn bushes and holes would be extremely annoying
---
Fire crow bringing his wing down?
---
What‚Äôs that butt scribble thing
---
But still a shield sounds imbalanced because 50% still makes you near immortal for 10 seconds. Great suggestion anyways!
