K lemme fix it real quick
---
---
---
I could care less about rosa tbh, i can play her tho i really don't like to,  and have no problems killing her 9/10...
---

---
Tick is broken,  i honestly expected much more since it takes so damn many trophies to unlock him compared to the other trophy road brawlers.  He's a meme for sure,  a big letdown.  
---
My suggestion to fix him is this:
---
         Shorten his range to that or less of spikes special (before the spread)  make his standard attack detonate immediately upon impact,  and bost his health 800 or so.
---
Man what have you smoked lmao
---
Imagine Shelly in Boss Showdown

Heck yeah
---
How you got 50k???
---
sorry, I thought you were being sarcastic
---
I love it that you took requests from the community. 
---
I wish I can give you a gold, If I'm not poor :(
---
This is why all the best players don‚Äôt play solo showdown, it is a shitty gamemode through and through that only provides any trophy value if you become a vegetable. I personally don‚Äôt count solo showdown as a gamemode for these exact reasons, it is just based circumstance and gives you very little power to make choices. 
---
Duo showdown is the same thing but functional because the teams create more distance between opposing sides, it is a bit campier because of the revive mechanic but is also less punishing for those who play a little more aggressively. 
---
I play Duos and gem grab most of the time, duos gives me the power to carry since I only have 1 teammate to worry about. Gem grab can screw you over with bad teammates but if I keep playing I will eventually go positive as long as I am playing a brawler that isn‚Äôt complete trash on the current map.

---
Big brawler plus band aid star power

This is what brawl ball was meant to be
---

I had Crow at 2000

Yes I think he was just not patient

It's not confirmed

New Star Power: Thicco's Hug
---
Ive seen this at least 10 times
---
AGREED
---
If you have at least 4k trophies at some point,  you've unlocked anything that matters,  so worrying about trophies after that is pointless,  vanity even. 
---
I team with my son all the time,  he's pretty damn good with pam and shelly in certain modes,  but that's about it.  We're have a blast together and more importantly,  we get to bond doing it.  
---
Besides,  trophies really don't tell you anything about player quality,  a baddie can be carried,  and a pro can be dragged down. 
---
My advise,  enjoy it the way you want to.          üòâüëç

It's actually 300 for rank 20 and 100 less for 15 and so on. It sucks that they halved it.
---
Rosa is fine since the nerf, definitely made me salty a lot at release though so I hope it'll be the same with Tick (so either he gets adjusted or people stop playing him as much or both). I like your ideas though
---
Wait thats illegal
---
But Colt is a sheriff
---
Sorry, but... 
---
Choose the color of the uniform, okay
---
Choose the number.... no

I hope you're right

Well,now there's no frustrating lose streaks,which I like.So I don't want to lose 10 trophies in 1 go. But maybe add one more siege so it's not to boring.

That would be me

Why are you runnin

How do u do this

Very nice man creative it must shoot like honey or bees

kkkkkkk

Ye
---
Dude we had a level two with us and no level ten, they had two level tens and a level eight. I‚Äôm pretty sure the only reason we were matched with them was because we were all on high trophies, not high levels

Oooh! Stick a folk me!

What is Gene's lamp named?

Yeah. Some kind of come back

This reminds me of a previous post except the it was the guy's cousin and he didn't even let him play brawl stars. Also a big rip for him he was about to get his Leon to Rank 20 and he lost him 78 trophies.

Wrong map for Pam, last map was better for her.

Love this idea. Probably just remove yellow/gold customizations from this so the gold mecha skins still have a purpose.
---
I've never played it, but I'm pretty sure it's not a ripoff
---
Oh ricochet is wanted
---
Yes. That‚Äôs exactly right. Power level doesn‚Äôt matter. This is food matchmaking.
---
Wish i had good teamates to help me, i only get teammates that rush towards the boss, then run near the safe when they‚Äôre low causing me to get fucked up
---
No. Most randoms (myself included) don't understand how to play the game mode, so you lose 50 trophies in 20 minutes trying to get a star token. I've since learned how to play, but most of my team mates are still trying to figure it out. And since the matches last nearly 5 minutes each, once you know you're gonna lose, it's a waste of 3 more minutes of infuriating frustration. I actually play this new siege now. 
---
Supercell should have made the siege send out two robots, one on each side, and then it would have been balanced.

Annoying for Gene's opponent I presume? What I was thinking is that Rock only last a short time like a 1-tile long then after that, it becomes Paper. Given that a rock is 1-tile in measurement and if Gene and his opponent is at each side of the rock, the hand will transform into Paper after it bisect the rock. 
---
Rock, in my imagination, is for face-to-face encounter and a counter for the likes of Bull and Shelly.

The old siege was a game mode that had strategy.
---
New siege is hot garbage with no skill involved. There literally isn't enough time to make it back to the middle to collect, so whoever gets the first bot wins. It's awful.
---
Guess who is back in making comics!

And if anyone knows the reference to the title: I love you!

I only need crow who cares about Leon

you used two separate accounts to screen shot this right? i really hope you did...
---
it took me a lot of time, like 2 week each one, the easiest was jessie, i use her in siege when it still give 10 trophies with star power and easy wins (btw sorry if i spell something wrong, english is not my first language)
---
I just wanted siege to not have 2x trophies and tokens. The game length was fine. Like if the game is on average 2x longer than the other modes, you have 3 other modes to choose from if you're so pressed for time that you can't spend 5 minutes in a game.

The trash that can't do anything xD I died so many times bcuz of it I am an not xD

Do you mean that I should draw carl hog rider?

If my teammate Poco looked like that I wouldn't want him to heal me

No. You get tokens allotted to you over time. Increasing your trophy level and rank gives you tokens every rank

Yep. Good ol karma hoarding. Or some nice Photoshop

I wanna say they also felt pressed because literally all of the top players were ignoring other modes to push only on siege. Now with the one push wins, it is still the most reliable mode for pushing. Just all sorts of messed up rn.

I've been waiting for a star power since more than a month. My Nita stuck at lvl9

You want a revamp and then decide you want to pick and choose brawlers to apply this to. Sounds like your biases are getting to you and would complicate the game.

Yeah they should probably buff the IKE's HP back to 40k I've seen at least 13 divers in siege yesterday

No the thing is, all the colours I have are very basic

Oooooof

I am sorry for not killing any bots because it took so many tries to pull off this glitch to actually equip Bull's Star power and when I pulled it off, I just died before even experiencing the reload buff so many time. (sorry for bad english)

My Shelly always meets these teamers and I make it my job to take them down

I looked at your (cough, cough) ‚Äúmemes‚Äù and there SURE isn‚Äôt anything epic about them.

I'm yet to unlock crow, how much does his mecha suit cost ? 10,000?
---
Nothing needs to be fixed. Your opinions didn‚Äôt make this game a huge success. The game is huge and successful because of supercell themselves, not some reddit members. You guys did already mess up heist and now you wanna go further with murdering the game.

Dark is 10k gold is 50k

Still think second-gen Colt and Poco are the best versions of themselves

Maybe he left the match... When bots take over a player in a match (which happens when the player leaves) it will instantly deny play again.

I do play solo and u know what poco is one of my better brawlers I'm just saying hes meant for support.

If you want to reach 500 trophies I Will recomend you to play duo showdown. Solo showdown is very complicated.

I disagree. What you're describing is more accurate with the nerfed siege. The old siege gives more chance of coming back from a lost wave than this dumbed down siege. I miss the old siege. Its like a love and hate relationship. Now its just hate lol.
---
In a way it's better if it's annoying, so to raise awareness. Still, I really appreciate it!

Do you think you can do more than 30% to the IKE using this star power?

I saw the tweet. Dear god please don't make every game have a battle pass

You would be wrong to assume that I think all pocos are trash. I'm saying the ones that complain about him needing a buff are trash

---
Tbh I've never had it put to me that way, I saw those posts with Crow players playing like Bull. I'm simply raising awareness, he's rated number 26 and only F tier for a reason. Coach Cory is a meme-illiterate madlad but he's got a point about the tiny damage.
---
Well they have to make money from this now that they have a good fan base, so f2p players will have some hard times üòÇ
---
Dinamike: i'm grandpa
---
Barley: i am robot
---
Tick: me too
---
Mortis: heh
---
I don't even have photoshop
---
atleast you got that star token from siege :)
---
Would be worth 50,000 tbh; but they likely won't do it...
---
Nope, they would have to win at least 50 matches to get to 500
---
I pushed my level 4 Carl from 300 to 500 in 7 hours
---
sorry im a bit new to reddit and r/Brawlstars so could you please tell me how you got the little tag before your username with a brawler name please?
---
What password?
---
Nobody wants shelly to be that tanky, maybe they have to nerf that to 50% idk
---
Throw it into Rice
---
Answer is neither, i dont have enough gems
---
Outlaw colt is a part of that fan art, i just cropped it as much as possible since he is not appropriate for this meme üòÖ
---
*kills Mortis and spins*
---
Bandaid is supposed to get shelly out of life or death situations, healing  over time won't help when Colt is using his super on you and is hitting every shot
---
He fells too op and prob needs a nerf for his main attack
---
Oh i see you used the glitch
---
OHHHH YAAAASSS

√íw√ì

And that‚Äôs a fact

i will give it to you if you give yours.

1.6s isn't that slow, mortis has the lowest reload time at 2.4s

This is the best thing ever I hate it win people spin it's like they don't want to have fun. Thankfully they just got destroyed and bamboozled right there.‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è

As a poco main, I can safely say that poco doesn't need a buff
---
That's true... today I got 4:20 (LMAO)

Wow this is awesome. tbh tho, I was waiting for Rosa to appear and just kill both of them anyway like in the real game all the time. lol. make more please!

I LOVE the scene where you added other Brawl Stars animators! Well done, Lad!

Woah that was an old video of Darryl teaser before the update. You can‚Äôt find that video on Brawl Stars YouTube anymore... All old videos got removed right before global üò¢

Good gonna lad
---
The star power allows you to pick off solo players easier but it‚Äôs going to harder when there‚Äôs more then one person
---
Sure. Im planning to make Mecha Crow after that.
---
That‚Äôs cool thanks
---
*THAT'S A LOT OF DAMAGE!!*
---
It's preparing to overthrow us all
---
Great idea, but then because it's hard to heal everyone would be poco and pam.
---
And almost no Respawn timer!

If my teammates know how to pass

r/subsithoughtifeelfor

It just makes me want to explode
---
Crow was my first brawler to 500 and my first maxed brawler as well.
---
And I did both of those before his major buff.
---
He‚Äôs the worst thrower he NEEDS WALLS to survive,Barley and Mike can still kill a lot of brawlers without them
---
*now guess his age*
---
If i saw alpha shelly i wouldnt be afraid to go up to her with super to take her down
---
No ? Is what it says when it is still loading the names.
---
Feel you man made a did my best on a tick skin but it only got 3 upvotes feels bad man
---
I don‚Äôt know your situation so I can‚Äôt say for sure but some parents can‚Äôt say anything bad about their children and spoil them too much.
---
Just go into friendlies, pick the brawler whose star power you want, then go select the brawler who you want the star power on and immediately press the ready button. If the brawler picture on the menu doesnt change, the glitch should have worked. Also, some star powers don't work on some brawlers, and the brawler just won't have a star power.

You mean dynamikes?

Awww... &gt;.&lt;

Many of the maps are similar to one another, that's well because the concept or the idea is based on something that already exists.
---
Nevertheless we can still see the unique aspects of each map and we love them for that ;)

My lord.. that sentence construction

SOOOOO NICE. I waited til the end so u can also have the end ad

The super is too OP since it:

So amazing dude the 3 months of wait was worth it

What an idiot

I hate these damn posts. Whining cause they lost to higher power brawlers.

She looks like 16 (in this picture) but in the game...i have no idea

no you can use that ticket when you want and you can unlock skins on brawlers you have(bad english)

to much star points for a color

What is changed?

Lel sorry syntax error XD
---
Middle poco is still fire

RECOLOR Poco xd
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean pocos are always gonna be support lmao. I think what he‚Äôs trying to get at is poco if left alone by bad teammates could at least have higher damage to hold off other brawlers a bit.

Wow I didn‚Äôt expect such a genuine response. 
---
New map ideas that have a clearly defined centre seem to be repetitive, and don‚Äôt perform well as they are a magnet for teaming(although bushy centres somewhat prevent mass teaming, like Feast or Famine which is probably the most balanced map there is).  
---
Mass bushes around the outside create a zone of death because of patrolling Bulls and Shellys and create an unpleasant experience.
---
This glitch only works in friendly game. You first need to choose a brawler that has the starpower you wanna use. Then scroll to the brawler you want to get the starpower, and hit ‚Äúchoose‚Äù and then ‚Äústart‚Äù as fast as possible. If done fast enough, the game won‚Äôt swap to the correct starpower before you enter a game, and you‚Äôll end up getting the starpower of the first brawler instead. If you plan to do this with friends, every body else need to be ‚Äúready‚Äù before you do the glitch for it to work.

Well oiled colt

Who kild you

Even I have the leg probability higher in spite of the fact that i have all of them...

Well said. Siege was the only fun game mode and now they‚Äôve killed it. Crow was already strong and they‚Äôve gone and made him even stronger. Shelly‚Äôs band aid isn‚Äôt even strong at all, it‚Äôs balanced and now people are calling for a nerf already...

stop reposting

Nope it‚Äôs not

Because she used to be terrible? Oh no, they buffed a bad brawler! What a shame.

The funniest result imo was Penny with Jessie starpower, defending the turret has never been funnier. Bull with Rosa heal is kinda broken too
---
Amazing job Francy!!! That was awesome!!!
---
They won‚Äôt nerf it because it‚Äôs not op lol
---
Quite the plottwist.
---
I mean it has a 20 second cooldown and most of the games don't last over 2 minutes so I really don't see an issue with it. 
---
Why would you chase a shelly into the bush anyways?
---
Unfortunate. 
---
But on the bright side, you‚Äôre very close to 500. Did you make it there?
---
A heist map , that like name suggest is summer themed and is pretty ,,Chaotic,, . Yeah , you dont have lots of space in this map. i think this one should be added to game , a nice design and i think pretty playable . Honestly i was inspired by Sunstroke - a bounty map .

Everyone can team, but everyone will hate you. If there is a powercube usually the closest or strongest one picks it/the one who could pick it gives it to the another. And btw you dont deserve to have Tick

Mortis doesn‚Äôt cancel his attacks and brock is a good showdown brawler
---
I would delete this and most it again so that way you will get at least 500 upvotes
---
Darryl is actually quite good on that map because he can roll all the way across the water that stretches across the map to the enemy safe. Brawlers are a lot of times map dependent, not just game mode dependent.
---
My boi Maractus is better than that weird Digimon thing :thonk:
---
Well i will try
---
I will try
---
Yeah, make endgame content only available for a specific amount of players when everyone could "benefit" from it and have something to work towards, good job! Tho I do agree that removing the Tokens from the Season Reset is kind of a loss but now we at least have some kind of character customization wich is nice to have, having to always play with the same looking Colt or Bull as f2p player gets kind of boring and its not really worth it to save gems for skins as a f2p unless you really like it
---
What yall talking about . it takes only 30 seconds
---
No i think he meant it purely ad information
---
Oh no...now the bull gets a broken star power and shelly gets another strong one...please dont do it supercell...
---
Amazing
---
Bacco
---
I think he's overpowered
---
Yeah lol, instead of Keemstar, he‚Äôs a Brawlstar
---
Mushrooms will not spawn on players close together. Since you were so far off, the game only gave them to you. Supercell added this to prevent teaming.
---
PENTUPLE GENE SLAP!
---
Dark mecha crow is better
---
I disagree, hes a thrower who recognizes traming is bad, so while stupid, he has good intent
---
First off, how is the popsicle still in his mouth if his teeth are completely closed. Secondly, you should make your artwork a bit more brawl starsy rather than like some newspaper comic
---
This would be interesting but in the end it doesnt make that much of a difference, skin prices wouldnt change so you'd still have to get to rank 15, 20, etc, and when you must get to that rank to get the star points it "encourages" you more because you get all of them at one, when you can get star points after every rank up you dont feel like you have to push as much anymore. I'be be ok if this was added for the first 10 ranks tho as they are usually not that hard to push and they can keep new players motivated
---
Yeah they actually destroyed it
---
What is he holding on his hand?
---
Congratulations!
---
Calm down everyone has their own art style
---
It‚Äôs your own opinion

Yeah...I mean first of all I would like to see a skin for tara and a voice for darryl FIRST and then leon skins...but whatever comes first, its ok.

You can't really test all Star Powers. You can't test Gene or Poco for example. Beside that you can play a bot game. Every Star Power is unlocked there
---
Yeah I understand, my idea is simply the same as the actual sistem, but this is easier to understand, anyways a player with less than 3000 won't be able to purchase anything with these star points, I mean you don't get that much star tokens before rank 10

r/BrawlStarsP I opened the gates of hell
---
Uhhh. 
---
Good question.
---
Yeah, the actual sistem is that: rank 10:100 star points, rank 15:200 star points and rank 20:300 star points, this is just a suggested rework to the rank up reward sistem to make it easier to understand rewarding you by each rank
---
This pun deserved an upvote

The poster (TryCryGhost) had it for a skin idea a long time ago. So, I thought it was funny and decided to point it out.

Guys, don't argue over a highschool freshman, you both made really compelling arguments, and I agree, criticism is really important and constructive on the journey to becoming an artist, we don't get better by getting nothing but compliments. 
---
But at the same time, Jesus, is my art so bad that you can make something 10 times better?  I made this in like half an hour. And I'm sure you are super talented, but do you expect everyone to draw on computers and could potentially be working for Supercell, this is just a fun little idea I thought off and I think would be pretty interesting to hear your opinions on. 
---
Also there are 15 more places to criticize ? I kinda want to know where you think is not good enough...
---
I have purchased BLOONS TD 5 and 6 their very Fun

I don't think this is necessary since they can already say the play rates for all of the maps. They remove maps that aren't played often, and keep the loved ones in rotation

Continue the matches until you break your Phone in half
