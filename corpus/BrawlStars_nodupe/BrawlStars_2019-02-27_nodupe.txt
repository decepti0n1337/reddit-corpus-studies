Byaw byaw byawwwww

Looks good
---
I hav fought 3
---
Jessie was already remodeled with the frank and penny update. They still need piper, Tara, bo and el primo cuz they were never remodeled
---
I‚Äôm not even aiming at maxing my account, I just want to unlock the last 3 brawlers I don‚Äôt have. 
---
It could be a bawler re-work???
---
Yours could be the one behind ryan because the other guy looks like a mole
---
If youre gonna name yourself mortis, flair it too wtf
---
bull is THICC
---
Wait where is this from
---
That is clearly the head of a pickaxe.
---
Right, I forgot cuz I wasn't paying when that happened 
---
Lol
---
I don't think so, it kinda looks different
---
How
---
Username checks out
---
Visually, i think its her.
---
But that 8k hp tho...
---
Poco is a bad choice for Poco
---
Holy crap you are right.
---
It's a new brawler
---
To max my whole account around 100-120$. I was stupid with my money and you could easily bring it down to 100. I also played religiously. There are people who are f2p and max.
---
You think you can open a legendary with those box #s? üòÇ
---
This is just kinda uninspired. Really boring. Uninteresting attacks, super does nothing interesting. His star power dies nothing cool, not pirate like, and does extremely little.
---
REDUCE, REUSE, REEECYCLE
---
The brawler there brings is a Frank
---
I literally went on a four day streak of getting new brawlers every day, you can't stop me
---
Maybe its a skin?
---
But what brawler has 8k hp right now?
---
Crazy frog scared me when I was small
---
It‚Äôs actually frank, considering his health in the picture is exactly the amount he has at lvl 10 
---
Very similar to a idea of mine and it is an exact version of the idea but I'll let it slide as i am very easy to push around and as a billion other people have done same 
---
[deleted]
---
Yeah this game made me mad AF today lost a lot of trophies with brawl ball. they need to fix this.
---
 you're right, i saw his headphones.
---
I fear bushes 
---
Now i fear this
---
Pam is S in Gem Grab. No doubt about it that. 
---
*I didn't notice that micro-penis.*
---
Nope, i just realized it's frank, it's exactly the same HP that he has at lvl 10.
---
It looks more to me like it is returning to the Brawler named "Ryan".  It also doesn't make financial sense to release 2 brawlers at once.  All of the whales will open boxes to get the new brawler.  If they have the chance to get 2 different brawlers, their odds are higher and it will take less boxes overall to unlock 2 brawlers if both are released together.

Tara pulls the tarot card star platinum

Lol, i just realized it's frank.

You are right!

I can just see his purple hair and a black line of his headphones.

Tara is an Indian name which stands for stars

And crow is a crow... No explanation needed.

Should be A in BB imo. He‚Äôs good, but there are better options.

Grind and whine

What are you saying? You trying to convince me teaming is the way to go?
---
no joke, my luck is incredible. hear me out. the day after Gene was released, normal fucking box and I pulled him. "Aight, that's really dope, my first mythic. Let's Go!" Literally three regular boxes later I pull Spike. Three Nights Ago off of a regular box I pulled Crow, my box luck is amazing.
---
Fool everyone has the damn idea it doesn't make you special in fact recently I even made a whole stats and concept of a boomerang character and sent it to the brawlstars team
---
Ur a thorn on my side, took me 200-300 boxes to get gene
---
laughs in 240p
---
also I'm f2p 
---
because im broke :(
---
r/MortisGang
---
Yes. When they start spinning in circles you better spin two before someone else does then stab them in the back when they get close enough
---
I agree. spike gang unite!
---
ty was waiting for the ppl that also saw it
---
This is late but I saved up 8 big boxes and 65 brawl boxes for gene but didn‚Äôt get anything can I get an oof
---
Can someone link the twitter photo? I see a lot of people asking for it....
---
[removed]
---
My god snorlax... i like the creativity but really?
---
Its a new boomerang brawler named Carl. If you go to Version History in the app store, its already there.
---
I believe that an error occurred in the App Store and released the update notes ahead of time. Android did not happen that.
---
It‚Äôs already confirmed by supercell on twitter
---
It‚Äôs already confirmird by brawl stars Twitter they posted a pic
---
No because I would rather update my game and get 50 gems in that case
---
Updated and now the game won't launch. 
---
Proof crow doesn't need a buff
---
When i was like 6 i loved crazy frog until i found out he had his dong out.
---
Hahaha nah, supercell will give you 3 power point for rico tho
---
Oh good. Not just me. 
---
Yeah but cheif pat didnt confirm it
---
Nice dodge!
---
LOL so I didn‚Äôt come on here before I downloaded it????? Sorry most devs test these kinda things. Lololol don‚Äôt defend this trash, there‚Äôs no excuse. 
---
Did you end up winning the game? Rip the other team
---
Go to Version History in the App store for brawl stars. Carl's abilities are stated there
---
That's so generous, I'll take it
---
That‚Äôs no boomerang. It‚Äôs a pickaxe!
---
i WAnt mY MoMmY
---
I don‚Äôt think I spent any on the doubler. The doubler is more value than pure mega boxes, though! Tickets have the most value
---
I have the exact opposite of thisüòÇ
---
Great spot!
---
like how you made it a spoiler, so we can just see this, which is funny.
---
I only have 2 GB of data per month and I need it for other things also, so it's usually not the best solution (in terms of money). But yeah, I rarely lag on LTE, and if I do, it's just once for a few seconds
---
Huh
---
Just asking why you think that
---
Yea we won lol. Shelly came back.
---
So you have not read the comments? Sorry, it's still your fault.
---
I'm sure that, seeing as you acknowledge that it can happen, you also acknowledge that it will happen. Not everyone has the reaction time or character speed to make up for the mistake of walking through his bombs, however I'm more so talking about late game in modes like gem grab where a well trained Bo could have already used his super 4+ times with only one bomb being set off in each set. Since those don't time out, you can effectively carpet your side before taking ten gems back there and watching the other team fail to get through. As brawlers hit them, Bo gets another and another. As for the "ease" of tripping them and surviving, you may want to keep in mind that you have better judgement on that than most. I have never used or seen Bo's super and therefore have no idea how it acts, considering that this is probably true for a good enough portion of players at my skill level, It's not nearly as easy for us to judge how to set it off or predict where the rest landed.
---
You shouldn't be in the top 200 and pretend to know what the &gt;100,000 people behind you want.... Supercell destroyed my favorite brawler just because of a game mode, yours can take a hit for a REAL reason
---
PS. Bo's super needs a damage reduction OR he should shoot one less arrow
---
ouch
---
Lmao 
---
I got that too
---
I legit almost jumped for joy then I saw my sadness of a bankroll.
---
Same 
---
Yeah. You should update you never know
---
It's looking like Mortis is next. Well played. 
---
wait what? one ammo bar?
---
I really need to know crow now..... it‚Äôs hurting my brain not knowing. 
---
I dont need to play so might as well
---
Source?
---
I thought it would be cool if instead of poison daggers he threw freezing daggers (they are so cold it hurts... they wouldn‚Äôt actually freeze people) 
---
the game is giving error in the system ios  after the update
---
Battle Royale ?
---
That's me!
---
App Store. But don‚Äôt update! It is glitched!
---
Love it!

Great, the flood of posts started

I meant can‚Äôt

Yeah, if you download update you will get it, just wait for supercell to say something

ah, well wish i‚Äôd checked reddit before checking the app store for another app. well, thanks. 
---
Attack: swings the chain around him 1 second, 400 damage
---
Super: swings the chain around him 3 times while boosting forwards, 2 seconds 
---
Star: super does knockback
---
Yeah I think this will be a mix of the executioner as his main attack and the valkyrie as his super. Maybe his star power will  have him regain health for each hit he gets. 
---
We know he‚Äôs called Carl... but let‚Äôs be real, Doug is a way better name. 
---
Yea same. I guess thats one way to get stuff done 
---
I feel like updating so I can get potential compensation, and i didn‚Äôt feel like playing for a few days anyways
---
How could a cactus become so rich?
---
I don't know either.
---
Lol no need to thank me. I‚Äôm pretty sure you already knew that.
---
Theres already 3 brawlers of each rarity why another brawler tf
---
How bout carl
---
Game needs maintenance before launching the new updates 
---
I updated the fast i could. Maybe they will compensates  the hours you didnt played

I know

Idk, happened to me before, do you have a supercell id?

Too late! Can we get an F for each poor soul who updated?

Oh fuck.. I got hyped for a second 
---
Yes I did but thanks for letting everyone else know. But if don‚Äôt look at a pinned post , sadly they also probably won‚Äôt look at this
---
Don‚Äôt auto aim, because it will take time for the bombs to explode and by that time you will miss. Instead, try to throw where you think they will walk. Get a feel for the timing.
---
If you are fighting a dynamite yourself, walk unpredictably, so you can dodge more shots.
---
Pretty basic, but that‚Äôs all I have to say 
---
R/CROW GANG

Ok thank you

Yeah, just wait until supercell does something unfortunately

#FlyingMachine33?!?!?! You are working on Brawl stars art too? 
---
I love your cr works üòçüòò
---
Nice
---
I updated now hope we get something for it lol
---
yes, use him on a map with a lot of walls. Keep you distance from any brawler. When you throw you dynamite, there is a delay until it explodes, so time it correctly
---
Lol good thing i turned auto update off and checked reddit
---
Yeah.... I can't sleep now... Thanks
---
Legend has it that barley has still been juking shelly shots... **haha why does auto aim exist now**
---
Oh thank you so much bro 
---
That‚Äôs true. Oh well. I‚Äôm sure it will be fixed soon anyways :P
---
If you update this game you experience this issue
---
I‚Äôd buy it
---
Erm wayyy late. You know if they will fix it soon?
---
Its so bad idea...
---
Yea I was one of those people that posted about the bug. I really didn‚Äôt know what was up till I read this and sorted by new. Your post helped me.

I make this map

pretty accurate, i shall say

Congrats!

Wish i could say the same. Im at 5450 trophies and i don‚Äôt have Gene or any of the legendaries. Buff Legendary Drops!!

Spike is such a cute and amazing character, I really want that pink variant but I don‚Äôt even have spike :((( all I want is spike :(
---
U r soo fast
---
yea hey, massive bug i have encountered, me and four of my friends attempted to play brawl stars as i had recently downloaded it and thought it would be fun with more people, anyway, i updated my app and it stopped opening in the same fashion as theirs, popping up with and error message reading "TID\_NATIVE\_DIALOG\_VERSION\_NOT\_UP\_TO\_DATE\_STORE\_NOT\_READY\_TITLE"  with smaller print appearing underneath the previous message. Myself and my friends are all on the latest ios update and are curious as to why we cannot play due to the new game update. 
---
Cheers
---
Happy cake day

Omg I was literally scrolling through this sub to find a Ryan drake format to use to make this exact meme

Yeah, the update wasn‚Äôt meant to go live, we just have to wait until supercell says something

Ok.. Buts these problems make you not wanna play the game, I thought that if a lot of people don't feel like playing anymore it means that the game is losing players and hence dying...  And honestly,  how many new players will stay after getting frustrated to the core?

Lmao a little late, update has been leaked, it's a super rare brawler named Carl that throw a pickaxe like a boomerang

Wow great job sector again, this was fast. Btw was there any changes to the new game mode, I saw the old leaks on the now called ‚Äúsiege‚Äù mode (according to the patch notes in my apple store) and I was wondering if you found anything new about it.

Buff crow

Aight thanks. Honestly it seems like an easier grind than Clash Royale

Wow that's cool, wtf the mortis skin

Is it difficult to schedule the release for when they are awake

Not as hot as my boy sakura spike tho, that boy thicc.

What are you talking about he is hot now.

It crashes your game.

Hell yeah man thats a great concept hope super cell sees

There was an optional update with a new brawler, but everyone that got it got infected with the bug, so they can't play for now

A kangaroo word!

Yeah I agree, really liked the style and how the axe looked. It's just that mortis isn't fit for a night witch concept imo, but the art is great, and a mage mortis would work well with it!

Agreed, Carl is mine.

Same, can‚Äôt play the game and I‚Äôm at max tokens..
---
You lost your proggress you might not get it back 
---
Seems legit because the game mode was leaked a while back and the brawler is a thrower like the one in the pic with the ryan
---
Help me find a way to fix this

Ok good luck with digging your wallet grave further

Repost, I posted that exact meme one hour earlier \*\_\*'

PLZ DONT UPDATE YOUR GAME IF YOU ARE GIVEN THE CHOICE 
---
Same happened to me. How to fix it?
---
It happened to me came here looking for answers 
---
Maybe one day you‚Äôll make enough money to afford Apple products. 
---
Is this an OC?
---
If you go on the App Store to brawl stars it shows you the update notes
---
So if I take this final exam its a single exam that I want to keep perfect score. But because it is easy for me to screw up. So right now if I screw up I should be given a 50% advantage for my next exam??
---
You should not be rewarded for screwing up. You screw up that's it. Learn to aim properly. There is no need to make his super even stronger than it is just because it isn't the top 5 brawler. So what now we need to buff every weak brawler and make them top 5? The thing that need to be changed is probably his reload speed making him easier to charge his next super, not giving him a free 50% super charge for screwing up his shot. 
---
Can't wait to pickaxe the fuck out of everybody with Carl! Also, wtf is that Mortis skin!?
---
Wait so no balancing? My boy Daryl is still the king?
---
Ngl Mortis is better as male imo preferably w/ a hat
---
Not all the gift boxes are shaped like a cube, it can be shaped like a cylinder
---
Why would they make a female skin for him? üòü
---
Appreciate it man but I did it anyways in case supercell gives gems for the inconvenience
---
Im sorry to hear im going around trying to help 
---
Crow is a crow (bird) and needs buuffffffff
---
What‚Äôs the longest you could survive as Pam using her super to lose health more slowly, if no one attacked you?
---
Pretty accurate except it‚Äôs your creepy uncle and he is cross-dressing....
---
Please let that Mortis Skin just be a placeholder... PLEASE SUPERCELL I BEG YOU
---
Rip I‚Äôm idiot
---
The primo one‚Äôs ‚Äòprimus‚Äô doesn‚Äôt make sense, his name translates to ‚ÄúThe cousin.‚Äù
---
Yeah forgot about that he looks sick. Edited my comment. But still this new one is trash. And technically wizard was originally from clash of clans and night witch was originally from clash royale. Even though both games have them now. Just an interesting note
---
Wtf is the bullet bill in the corner doing?
---
Wait what is that 
---
They clickbaited us into the update.

I use strathmore toned tan paper with Carand‚Äôache And prismacolors pencils. The out line is copic multi liner 0.5

No, I meant give him a purple suit and call him ‚ÄúSpike Lee‚Äù. üëçüèº
---
THIS IS PERFECT
---
Mortis skin reminds me Bon Clay from One Piece
---
Dammit, was trying to make a joke
---
See iPhone automatically updates almost anything.....
---
F
---
I hope supercell is trolling
---
Haha I gotchu now. Honestly I‚Äôd take regular tara over that... thing
---
No
---
It updated on its own :(
---
Nice goal, but I feel like they should have brawler replays for brawlers over 200 instead of 400 because a few days ago there were only 25 seconds left in overtime, the score being 1-1, and  I was playing darryl. We were past the half line, my teammate that was a poco passed me the ball just before they got stunned by franks super, I was running for it when not much later an el primo came at me, I shot the ball forward and used my super and shot the ball right before a mortis dashed for it, and I scored, winning the game
---
That's good too. üòä
---
Some of us can't see the update notes so we are grateful for the info
---
Female Mortisisisis
---
Thot mortis lol 
---
Its in the iOS App Store
---
Some of you guys also can‚Äôt scroll through the subreddit. There is exactly 30 more posts exactly like this 
---
It looks a JoJo character with those lips but that's not okay
---
‚ÄúWe need to talk...‚Äù
---
Carl...he has a long range normal atk but his super is close range aoe...both damage isn‚Äôt really that high .
---
Any idea how to use him?
---
Yep cause I just got 2 mythics (back to back), an epic, and a legendary brawler within a week F2P BTW! 
---
Leon gang
---
Oof
---
Wall intervene
---
Ikr
---
WAIT WHAT YOU CAN GET BANNED FOR SWEARING
---
FUCK
---
So if you updated is the why my game won‚Äôt load ? 
---
I like lag
---
Tbh, they're fairly easy to get.
---
It was indeed a masterpiece. Thankyou for your contribution comrade
---
Aww dolphinsrnice isn't in my friends list anymore lol
---
Gg
---
Where did you get this night witch mortis skin? 
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
I used to do pretty good with Tara on this map too, but I just lost 4 straight :(
---
GENEus 
---
You can't update it or anything, they removed it so people won't update. They're trying to fix the issue so it'll be gone in the mean time
---
I REALLY THOUGHT THAT MORTIS SKIN WAS SOMEONE TROLLING LOL
---
Guess that someone was the devs
---
Brawler Horror Story
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Ma‚Äôam‚Äù
---
Was datamined a couple hours ago
---
Yes he realized first that we were in the same game so yeah
---
Where do you get the update info?  Like screenshots or pics? 
---
wow that Mortis skin is ugly as fuck
---
We could've got a bomber skin for dynamike or a miner skin for Mortis 
---
Instead we get this 
---
And here I'm trying to say there are other ways to buff him. Making his reload speed shorter so that he can fire more shots to charge his super is a better and more fair way than giving a free 50% super charge if he misses. No brawler should be compensated for screwing up their aim. Rather it would be better to allow them to fix their mistakes by allowing them to charge their super faster. 
---
Sir, the police are on their way.
---
A tragedy
---
Where is it confirmed
---
When will it go live
---
U like crossgenders?  K fine a hot lady with male mortis voice is good 4 you. 
---
Very nice, what kind of supplies did you use to draw this ?
---
What products does iOS make? 
---
Hahahaha LOL 
---
BEHOLD THE UNDERMINER
---
AHHH THAT‚ÄôS HOT
---
What's wrong with his right hand? 
---
Looks great! üòé
---
Took one to the head now he‚Äôs different.....
---
Mortis my boi, what the fuck. Lol
---
It's updating right now. If they haven't fixed the App Store issue, which I doubt, you can always find it under your Purchased history on the App Store
---
The brawler is not "part of the update" if it's released in the middle of March. 
---
I don‚Äôt think we deserved the night with Mortis though
---
True 
---
Holy crow. Crow got a buff!
---
I'm glad that this update focuses on content instead of polish. The polish has been perfected over the course of almost two years now, which means that more attention can be given to new game modes, maps, brawlers, features and the like.
---
A crossover we need?  So you like new female mortis with male mortis voice?  Wut
---
Not even the walls can save you now
---
I bet youtubers will still show gameplay with this skin
---
Wait it should go live td?
---
Yeah get it, I got a token doublers deal as well 1000 tokens for 30gems 
---
But again is he?
---
So we‚Äôll get a reward as compensation, right?
---
BRUH THAT NITA HAT. 
---
No, he's miner
---
Wtf is this creature
---
Spike left untouched? 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/brawlstars/comments/avay43
---
No need to be a prick.
---
Crow needs more imo.
---
Was hoping to see Gene get a dps increase but other than that I like it. Not sure how everyone else will feel about the crow buff though lol. 
---
Releasing today or is the maintenance to fix the update bug?
---
Yes officer this post right here. 
---
Brawl Stars seems to have this recurring theme of *disappearing* with every update following global lmao
---
üòÇ
---
Feels like its gonna be another game breaking card
---
I'M A SISTER OF THE NIGHT
---
Launch pads hmmmmmm
---
as soon as i get used to the other leon nerf we get another, we should just remove 20 base damage off him every update and make his invisibility easier to detect from half a tile away every update as well
---
1 gem compensation 
---
I updated but I'm still able to play, no new stuff unfortunately. I'm on Android btw
---
Where can i complete surveys? 
---
After the maintenance over!
---
Wow this update is so awesome!
---
hype is real :D
---
Looking like a drag queen lmao
---
What a great guy
---
Welp, I got a new phone and updated iphone. Now I jump on reddit for answer only to find disappointment sighhh
---
I laughed so hard ! 
---
Barley also got one
---
Yea, lvl 78 here, I only had one welcome pack but then it gave me the lvl 5 and 15 pack so makes me think they‚Äôre gonna go back up to 75
---
I wanted the only cut scene! Duh
---
game crashes for android. If you have an apple update if not then idk 
---
He has great range and area of denial. He isn't a close range type brawler. His role is to keep enemies in their feet and prevent them from healing and trying to push for gems/safe. 
---
With me the same
---
Gene is hecking OP now. Dude's super travels through walls and travels faster? It's literally THE most game changing super now üòñ
---
Half of March
---
What do u mean ??
---
Wait. Crow has a smaller hitbox?
---
Thanks .. üòÖ
---
I couldn't play without the update and when I downloaded it my game started to crash all the time
---
I don‚Äôt have any new news !
---
*¬ªSuper can now travel through walls¬ª*
---
Watch out throwers..!
---
"Despre aplica»õie" Salut frate!
---
The only thing leaked was the new event.
---
oh they should change it from toxic assassin to toxic keep everyone at bay then
---
I see you're a fellow member of the MORTIS gang 
---
Gem Grab
---
For some strange reason I still didnt get a notification to update. I got to know about it from here 
---
I did buy that already long ago and got it again now. 
---
Tried to buy it but didn't recieve anything even though my money is gone.
---
Yours better than what they designed
---
That‚Äôs better than over buffing tho. Why do u guys love playing overpowered characters anyway? IMO, crow is already balanced as it is.
---
is that night witch from cr?
---
Lado me
---
Doesn't work, many have reported this issue on reddit already 
---
Basically at any moment
---
So someone used "his" Google play/ apple ID or he is sharing it with someone?
---
Even I reinstalled. It still crash
---
Available in bounty mode
---
that's really cute idea!
---
same here 
---
Ah, so I bough that lvl 15 pack and it‚Äôs not offering me anymore, damn, was kinda hoping it would offer me all the packs up to 75 again lol
---
I call her, Morticia
---
contact support
---
EDIT: I logged in through a different device and it works. Maybe its a thing with some specific phones. Mine is SAMSUNG
---
Reinstalling won't work, tried 4 times
---
Same, can confirm 
---
it actually looks cute for me
---
It's normal
---
no my sis has android
---
Quality update
---
except that I'm pink now
---
Me too, do u have android?
---
Also to me
---
I wanted to do it but i would not make it that cool like you and that fast as you (if you ar going to make it then pls do something like (idea by sparkly-brawl_stars) pls it would really help me)
---
#buffcrow and #buffleon
---
They released info early today not to install when update appears, unfortunately mine auto updated (like most did id assume)  and i also cant play!üò° meanwhile it seems half that did update can access new gameplay but the other half cant whats up with that hey!?
---
Happens to all, give it some time 
---
That is muuuuuuuch better
---
Kinda dumb. Dunno who thinks .1 sec will do anything
---
Duck ;-   ; are nerffing darryl
---
Cross dressing Mortis? 
---
I can confirm that I bought it and it worked for me
---
If I could launch the game it would be great.
---
They make a Night Witch skin for Mortis because they both related to bats...
---
Any word on if its being fixed or
---
as soon as i level him up so that his damage is past 600 again, he gets nerfed again to be under 600
---
For Android it is crashing, not sure about iOs
---
Cool update and all, but I can't play this because it keeps crashing.
---
Worked fine before update, after update I click on Brawl Stars and it opens and instantly reports a crash. Like wtf am I supposed to do? Wait weeks for a fox that may never Come?
---
Supercell, please add name change for gems
---
Update is working fine now. If you can still play without I‚Äôm sure you will have to update in a few days to play
---
He's fucking annoying and/ or strong, what do you mean?
---
Ya probably...Hopefully it gets resolved soon...fingers crossed 
---
Is it being fixed?
---
hey devs if u r reading can we know when the problem will be fixed?
---
*dollar signs.. dollar signs everywhere* 
---
His super is great for taking out an injured colt, Jesse, penny etc. You don't jump into a full health Shelley or bull and expect him to kill them and survive 
---
All your giving crow is 0.1 seconds faster attack speed , wtf ?
---
Oh no
---
It is happening to everyone, we just gotta wait
---
I just hope they don't go the way of Clash Royale and remove gems from almost every offer.
---
lol who thinks they can kill shelly or bull
---
Hahahaha
---
Best one yet
---
Why me
---
Holy Crow
---
If you "buy" it again it will just come without spending the money again. I just had this 10 minutes ago
---
Probably. In some minutes or maybe hour they will probably release a new update fixing it or just removing the new one.
---
Contact support in-game or here https://supercell.helpshift.com/a/clash-royale/?p=web&amp;contact=1
---
Are they aware of the problem?
---
Being able to charge your super passively is a big enough advantage as it stands. Making that 10 seconds slower tones it down, but it is still a very unique feature. 
---
Damage is fine....
---
Me Too
---
That was fast
---
Our nightmares
---
Meeee
---
Interesting, I bought it, didnt get anything until i restarted and got the offer rewards, it seems like it turns out differently for everyone tho
---
Ur right
---
Nice! But who survived, you OP or Jessie!
---
Karma for youre background mby?
---
I think the face is a little bit weirder
---
Next? The end of the world
---
Thanks man just mad i cant pull ppl thru walls with gene yet lol
---
I prefer super monkey ball 3d battle mode to ultimate 
---
Paid again and didn't recieve it again lol
---
Dang, sorry to hear bro. It sounds like people have gotten this offer several times, and if you bought it once before, then you can‚Äôt buy it again.
---
yo guys they patched it
---
Didn‚Äôt realize that and updated but my game is working fine.
---
Alexa this Is do sad. Can we play Despasito? #savefelix
---
I think that he does deserve a small damage buff, but definitely not a reload speed buff, one of the differences between a decent gene and a really good gene is being able to know when you should attack and when you need to conserve shots. I don't actually think taking the damage off his super is that much of a nerf compared to the massive buff they gave to both actually hitting the super (it's now wider) and going through walls  
---
Killing Sasuke is not OK!
---
no i, there are guys that know how. i just ask to add avatar to reddit
---
Î∞òÍ∞ÄÏö¥ ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥ „Öé„Öé ÎåìÍ∏Ä Í∞êÏÇ¨Ìï¥Ïöî !
---
Oh thx :)
---
I wish from supercell to ADD it
---
we need to fix it
---
me too bro
---
something like draft challenge in clash royale?
---
Much better!!! 
---
lots hope that  supercell will ADD it
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure Night Witch doesn‚Äôt have lipstick...
---
Same problem, did that. No repsonse...
---
It's weird, they do walk, but they don't have legs. If u look, their dresses r full of holes and have nothing under there. It's just emptiness
---
no sense
---
it has holes
---
Ah ok
---
The game is not opening because they closed the servers to fix some issues related to the welcome packs and some crashes happening to people, you have to wait for the maintenance to be over
---
Well I hope they fix it soon 
---
I am also having the same problem with an Android device 
---
ehh cant crack the byeb\*\*\*hgone joke
---
Top Hat Mortis &gt; Rockabilly Mortis &gt; No Hat Mortis &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Night Witch Mortis 
---
This is the lazyest post ever
---
Balance changes is screwed up except for barley
---
The new Brawler is launching in march. The game is crashing for some people so they have to have a maintainance break. 
---
I have the exact same problem. Hopefully they fix this soon . It's been like this for about 2 hours .
---
Hat Mortis I'll make it. Thank you.
---
I'm shocked at the new skin of Motis ...
---
There‚Äôs a maintenance break RN
---
I dont think so cause my game worcked fine , and the news were saying that the new Mortis skin and a brawler will come
---
Mr. Supercell... I don't feel so good...
---
¬©Mortis 
---
it s coming soon
---
Emphasis on fuck boi
---
I tried what you did and it took me 5 minutes including searching for the videod, music and supercell logo start up
---
I used sony vegas pro.
---
Like ice lemon tea with no sugar
---
The game is crashing now because of robots clashing
---
Nightmare fuel #jaw
---
***YOU HAVE DENIED EVERYTHING I HAVE TAUGHT YOU***
---
mm interesting, idk how i never noticed that.. it actually seems a lot cooler now to me lol
---
I got on earlier and it said I could start a match due to maintenance break soon so it might be that? Mine is doing the same thing now.
---
where is frank??
---
Tks, but they could got an advice at poading screen
---
 Also intended :)   As a supercell-loving user, can I see more collaboration skins in game? 
---
Im on my phone and I can change my flair
---
Great idea I love it
---
You could make better teams with randoms and it would end with the repeated brawlers
---
Must be a maintenance while they try to fix the problem with the game not working on android
---
Ya
---
It smells like broke in here lmao get an iPhone, that‚Äôs why you keep crashing
---
OK GOOD JOB 
---
Damn seems glitchy I got the 170 
---
They said it on Twitter.
---
What did that poor Jessie ever done to you? 
---
Yes, female skin for a male character doesn't make any sense to me. Maybe make a female skin for a female character.
---
So you want leon to be nerfed, and then you want him to be strengthened?
---
I cant play after this update!!!! J6 2018 as device
---
lmao
---
Ï†êÍ≤ÄÌå®ÏπòÎÇ¥Ïö©ÏûÖÎãàÎã§.
---
 free trial with all brawlers and all skins on practice mode pls
---
Thought instantly the same, teleport bolts to cannon is weird looking and unbalanced imho
---
No I have it to
---
This is not just you mann it's like the entire community is facing this...
---
Ahem *BRAWLS STAARRRSSSSS?????*
---
Mortis skin comes in March 2, 2019
---
New brawler comes in mid March (THEY SAID THAT IN BRAWL TALK).
---
It also doesn't say maintenance break, it says unable to connect to the server, check your internet and try again, they're probably just fixing stuff.
---
It's the eye
---
Bull as gem carrier. Don‚Äôt make me laugh 
---
This will save the skin and make it acceptable! Good remodel!
---
Very Good i believe in you you could do better than that üòÄüëç
---
Just updated, and every time I open it it says connecting to server as it does. But never connects. Just says connection failure. Nothing wrong with my connection I have checked. I'm on Android 
---
Can we talk about testing the updates before pushing them to players?
---
Shelley-&gt;Shelly
---
Sorry for typo...
---
It's still just bad. Just don't make a nightwitch skin at all!
---
yes! i just wanted to wakeup and play the new update :( 
---
While we are going through this would u plz tell me how did u get that little Piper next to ur name buddy?
---
That's sucks
---
Maybe not. Brock got his third skin, and a little after, a very cool limited one. 
---
So, it depends of the Devs. 
---
Also, they can't stop the game just for a few people, if it crashes for some people, everyone will have to wait until they fix the problem
---
They prob got a lot of responses so it will take a while..
---
If you looked even for a second at this subreddit, you‚Äôd notice it‚Äôs happening to android users everywhere 
---
No, overpriced ones cost the same.
---
Me too
---
To me it says maintanace break
---
Even though the game crashes :( I like it that the update was only announced suddenly instead of like a week ago as imagine all the hype build up just for it to say 
---
#bRaWL StArs sToPpeD wOrKInG
---
WeLL, YoU‚ÄôVe got A vEst weAring CaCtus
---
When you fix it?
---
Just saying that you did way more work than you should've for something so simple
---
You have been playing sonce global and are complaining about no legendaries. Wow
---
Ive been playing since beta release which is a year and a half be4 global and i have no legendaries.
---
Just wow
---
I love how they make fun of crow and bo.. 
---
At least we know we will get what we want at some point..
---
Im guessing crow will be buffed in the next balance changes..
---
It works to me after i found an update on play store
---
all brawl stars is full of random
---
*dies*
---
Are you from Hong Kong
---
Same..
---
Can I commit fanart??
---
I dont have twitter anyome so yeah .....
---
Nope
---
Well consider this as a warning then, since he's coming later in March. I assume mid-March, like Gene was mid-February. 
---
Ok, now this is epic.
---
small indie company lmao
---
Was this before update?Also 3:33 am lol.
---
From TF2.
---
it‚Äôll say ‚Äúnext siege in: X:XX‚Äù. Once this timer runs out, the team with more screws gets a robot, and the other team keeps all of their screws but gets no robot. 
---
&gt; n m√°s despu√©s de recibir la actu
---
si, a muchos, por no decir a casi todos
---
I can't enter in game after last update
---
For some reason I expect his to be either crazy high pitched or crazy scratchy
---
Please help
---
After i updated brawl stars every time i try to start the game it crashes and there is written that the Brawl Stars stopped working
---
I tryied to reinstall the game and restart my phone too
---
Thanks for your effort
---
Works for me
---
Read through this Subreddit more...theres a Stoplight to Leon here, and it Shows, that that isnt the Case, espeshally Brawlball!
---
i know russian group, that do it. if you want, i can search there
---
Well it did indeed just come out, and datamined info isn‚Äôt always 100% accurate anyway.
---
I have a friend that has this problem
---
I cant even open it now lol
---
Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.
---
What about not showing reloading? I mean you can watch the boomerang 
---
Just wait. Sometimes the items don't arrive immediately. If you do not get them within 24 hours, contact Google play.
---
Leon nerf üò¢
---
Crow buff üôÇ
---
its like brawlstars and early MMo's had a kid
---
YES I AGREE
---
Its a permanent game mode. If you look at the game news it says showdown will be exclusively in slot #2 and siege will take over the other slot.
---
Now because of this 0,1 second Crow is the OP brawler :P
---
yes!
---
Please, do it!!
---
I don't usually save boxes, but I really wanted to save up for carl! There's gotta be at least 4 brawk boxes for compensation. Im f2p
---
No this is the new update that just came out yesterday and dont ask why auto-update updates my apps at 3 am. But just as a reminder, DONT update brawl stars.
---
When does siege start?
---
Why did the name colors change to a more dull hue?
---
I can't even open brawl stars after update
---
There is regular showdown. Some of the time it has modifiers, some of the time it doesn‚Äôt.
---
spin 2 win
---
You should watch the video so you can actually see the brawler
---
That makes sense! Thank you. 
---
It would work better with a helicopter 
---
I don't know about gene(don't have it haha) but am still amazed by this game mode.
---
So much dynamics interwoven together, they really hit it out of the park with this one..
---
The esports will absolutely love it! 
---
Tbh a boomerang-like concept isn't that original or unique... And the super is so different
---
Skin should be named pride mortis lol
---
As I said on my post THE WORST UPDATE EVER not really because of that but i could have added that
---
Creo que es a todos con un Android celular
---
Okay then i'll check!! Thanks for the info tho fr
---
I remember when mortis was supposed to look cool
---
I‚Äôm Guessing your little bro is playing around 200/300 trophies. And the fact you don‚Äôt have crow kinda means you can‚Äôt comment anything from Experience. I‚Äôm playing around 7.5K trophies and I know for sure in higher trophy games he‚Äôs pretty weak. You and your little brother probably play in low trophy count games so I don‚Äôt blame your inexperienced opinion. And anyway crow is the first brawler That coach Cory says needs a buff in his recent video. 
---
[coach Cory suggest balance changes ](https://youtu.be/Bwfut6WJZFw) 
---
Not our picture. Half is by u/GEDI-KOR and the other half is by Supercell. All you did was tape them together
---
Do the players who updated without knowing this get a reward?
---
Yea it looks great
---
Way better
---
Worts post ever made! :v
---
I think they made the skin goofy-looking on purpose just for humor
---
You are super talented, great work
---
I have samsung J7 nxt.  And Still not working after maintance break
---
And?
---
Crashes to
---
Why DID u destroyed my Darryl!!!!! 
---
Lmao spins to team but accidentally kills teammates
---
Wish I could play it
---
For real, a bunch of us are crashing
---
It took me a long time to do so
---
I prefer let me out of this update
---
Y-E-S-P-L-E-A-S-E
---
Now I know you guys do anything make awesome skin idea but this is waste of time fuckin supercell just doing our own work
---
Same lol
---
Your design looks a lot better than the supercell design not gonna lie, but you have to consider the fact that the skin is built primarily to look good in game and the points you mention about the skin colour don't really apply just because the game is based on these high saturation colours and the 3/4 perspective might also make it difficult to distinguish mortis with your design. Still really cool work done so fast. 
---
Yeah ok...but today it pissed me of...I mean worst map plus worst modifier to me...
---
Yes you are right. He comes from arabic fairytale "1001 nights" 
---
How much does sakura spike cost?
---
Imagine not being a creature of the night
---
This post was made by mortis gang
---
Agreed
---
The problem is that they probably won‚Äôt make another Mortis for a long moment cause of this one 
---
This night witch mortis is a disgrace. Remove this nonsense at once 
---
naw
---
Nerf leons range instead god damn it
---
Not on all android devices
---
long story xd
---
No. The way their health is now makes way more sense. Leon is close-range so he needs more health to survive and Crow is long range so he doesn't need as much hp
---
I wonder what's the most screws you could get in a single game of siege
---
Neither. I'm a golden Barley kinda guy.
---
Or even mega knight primo
---
Get a friendly game and leave all the screws on the map, then at the last minute, one team collects all of the screws
---
Bottles
---
This was the case when the game got a total makeover after softlaunch, every one was complaining, but it turned out to be incredibly perfect
---
Just come back after maintenance.. have the gens but still no boxes
---
OMG haha, Gene's New Voice is very funny 
---
Brawl star stopped working.problem.samsung j4.

Jessie
---
But You cant play without updating the game tho
---
Is this available in brawl stars maps? If yes where?
---
My opinion too!
---
Uh did you read who you responded to?
---
Yes i do and i hate it 
---
30 and19 on discount
---
But I would say you will get a super rare very easily without using gems
---
I agree!
---
Sup 
---
If I would stop crashing 
---
Yes same and people just cant understand that its too op and unfair(her super of course)
---
CANT OPEN BRAWL STARS AFTER UPDATE.
---
HEEEEEEEEEEELP
---
I didn't say u didn't. I also got it centuries ago
---
cuts of your elbow with lasermortis shovel
---
maybe because the dress he wore
---
Shame for me..
---
yeah
---
His super was incredibly underwhelming before, probably the most skill intensive compared to most which made is much less effective. I‚Äôm fine with this change since you can still screw your self and your team depending on who you pull. 
---
Amazing work dude!
---
For all those who think crow just got nerfed: Lowering the reload time allows you to get your ammo back more often and is a buff
---
Here is the list.
---
Rare offers cost 40 Gems (i think, dont quote me)
---
Super Rares are 80 Gems
---
Epics cost 170 Gems
---
And legendarys are like 350, im guessing.
---
They should focus on fixing the game on Android before slapping someone on the wrist for "spinning" even though it is somewhat annoying 
---
We'll see
---
Exactly! I mean, if they nerfed auto aim heavily/removed it, idec if this stays in the game. Try doing this without auto-aim. This wasn‚Äôt an issue before landscape. 
---
Right one and on a default one old animation was 100% better...same as on other brawlers...
---
It sure is 
---
Very interesting 
---
No mythics are 350, but thanks man! :D
---
yeah, pic is different to game. but, high saturation is ture. crow or bull is low sat but it's ok. :)  but Certainly, as much as the redesign of the Super Cell design, my work has also improved in quality. The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsupercell is big.
---
*falls down without hand and dropping gems *
---
Also fixing the connection issues when on wifi would be helpful, but I haven‚Äôt paid attention, I‚Äôm on iphone... sadly
---
Thancc
---
Totally spaced mythics, sorry bout that.
---
What the hell happened to mortis 
---
I can actually play the game. So i dont understand what all the fuzz is about
---
same here
---
This skin is horrible
---
Oh no, we have standards. Hat&gt;all
---
I made Phoenix Crow
---
Hi. This time, I made a Phoenix Crow .
---
If you want to watch the video, please watch YouTube.
---
[https://youtu.be/qnolH81YDWo](https://youtu.be/qnolH81YDWo)
---
Thank you.
---
He sounds like a Baby Trying to Be Happy
---
I have never seen a more interesting title in my life, very creative 
---
Yay. Thanks mate! 
---
Left because it looks more like a drink
---
?
---
Yeah but I dont want it like that...I mean how many thing will you change supercell?? Leave it be and just add more gamemodes in game better than changing every model or every attack animation or super etc...
---
Well I mean he‚Äôs not human. He‚Äôs some weird psycho Genie who has a creepy laugh, and has fun while he‚Äôs doing it 
---
Her damage is a little high 
---
Thanks but everybody knows that!
---
Could you make a builder Carl like from CoC?
---
How is that Jessie still alive
---
Another primo picks up the gems and supers To enemyspawn
---
Flair strategy?
---
Data mining to the next level
---
And its terrible
---
Decide by zero lol what
---
Wow I don't think I ever seen this low effort meme
---
Yeah just like Mortis there 0 for 2!
---
You‚Äôre gunna need a game of all friends or people not bots lol
---
looks great
---
wow
---
Crow needs a buff indeed. But all that spamming ? 
---
Shouldn‚Äôt we downvote this post just bc of transmortis?
---
Oh that's very kind, crow reload speed is now 0.1 second faster, I feel like I can kill a bull now
---
cool
---
Yes 100%
---
I DONT EVEN UNDERSTAND WHY THEY ARE MAKING LEON USELESS... NOW THEY DECREASED  HIS ATTACK AGAIN... THEY SHOULD BUFF IT
---
try using a launch pad?
---
Hey man let supercell do what they want
---
Ok guys. So, I updated it (shock,horror) and it turned out all right! I played two matches of Bounty with piper(I won a match and lost a match) and in the next Brawl box, I got Pam! Everything seems stable on my phone. *So far*
---
*ILL BUY YOUR WHOLE STOCK!*
---
Yeah he wasn‚Äôt anywhere near top tier, and I literally just leveled him up to power 9 5 minutes ago. My first 9 and he‚Äôs gone to shit :(. I didn‚Äôt think he was the best before but now... now is rough.
---
#But i don't wanna see Mortis's naked legs...
---
LOLLOLL Frank Wasted His Super Nice
---
U r the hero of ppl
---
Congratulations! Great job :)
---
Crow do not really need a mega buff, him is good at this point
---
Him is just high-skill brawler
---
And Crow is so far my fav brawler
---
It so stupid he sound like hes retarded
---
super well spent
---
"aahaabahabalabah"
---
-gene 2019
---
I Can play on my iphone but not on my android, thats Just stupid 
---
primo, crow and piper crying in the corner
---
Fix what
---
I think a lot of people like it 
---
Lmao 4450 trophies with 21 brawlers hahaha
---
Really? I've been scrolling through new and haven't seen it
---
do you use an ios? coz my game keeps crashing on android :/ im kinda jealous, i wanna try out the new features too
---
Yeah, I was joking
---
Yes..mthe good old days...Thats how clash royale died...too many changes that I got bored of amd stopped playing because of it...same thing will probably happend with brawl stars
---
So mortis is a trap 
---
Exactly this. I LOVE daryl, but I don‚Äôt have his star power so he‚Äôs pretty garbo to me. But with his star he‚Äôs amazing
---
Mortis is actually trans now
---
wtf this skin is fkkking ugly üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
what did they think? it has absolutely no aesthetic appeal (which is the only reason for skins since they don't offer buffs/stats) 
---
Nice meme! have thought about this too.
---
True that, it works on my iPhone but not on my android 
---
Petition to change the skin's name to Nightmare Mortis 
---
I dont even play barley
---
No u
---
Is the game working now?
---
Go to online players and at the bottom will be do not disturb 
---
__Data mining to the next level__
---
Before Tara 
---
Doesn't list crash on launch
---
Could be
---
My phone is not letting me play at all üò¢üò¢üò¢
---
What is leech life? 
---
Thanks man, when they said social tab I thought they means the actual social tab lmao
---
Where Is the new game mode? And where are the balance changes ?
---
Crow is not an assassin, he's an area control/poking Brawler. He specializes in preventing opponents from healing because the poison ticks last for so long. 
---
I bet it was done that way so it‚Äôs visible while you are playing. Still it looks really ugly. 
---
This is definitely photoshopped, unless Supercell's English is really that bad......
---
At first there was a maintanence break.about 20 minutes -1 hour later it came back.Im using iOS by the way.
---
The developers are those who have done much more work than me. Please do not despise them. T.T
---
Ryan'ed
---
Supercell!! Please fix showdown to prevent teaming!!
---
Supercell: removes life leech #facepalm
---
Ffs that's literally a minion from despicable me
---
You don't need the star power to be able to assassinate like half of the roster. His star power is great but Darryl is still usable in Gem Grab and Showdown for sure whether you have him maxed or not
---
I can't even understand Wat is he saying...
---
But my Baby say wawwahaeah
---
Seem like Gene knows Baby Language
---
It is for me.
---
Oooh good to see that again. 
---
Same here. I just updated.
---
Yup
---
If a Crow got close enough to someone to be blasted by a shotgun then that's the fault of the player for being bad
---
it was a modifier for showdown where you would constantly lose life and the only way to get health back was to shoot at enemies. Killing an enemy granted you full health back. It prevented teaming,camping and slow gameplay all at once. 
---
Too late oof
---
Stop these dumb petition post
---
Yes
---
Lool the update worked for my iphone se
---
I can play
---
Agreed, centered feels like something is off
---
Seems like an Android only problem
---
In game modes like Gem Grab, forcing the enemies to wait behind a wall instead of fighting for control of the middle is extremely powerful. That's exactly the kind of thing you want to be doing...
---
Lol, Leon is crap now
---
Yes. 
---
Tried restarting the game to no avail. They better get this fixed.
---
yo do we have any info talking about when this update will be released?
---
ITS A  TOP 3 BRAWLER! I got it at 560..so..Play safe..Dont get close unless they are walking straight towards you or away from you, dont use ur super as a defense system..you can control a area with it very well..thousand lakes is a very good showdown map for it..i pushed it here after 500..and gemgrab is ofc its best.. and if u r gem carrier ur prime role is ro not die..if u die..u are just a burden to ur team...its not necessary to take every gem..play defensive..if u think its not harmful then only go and take the gem
---
Same here on Android. I regret paying to win now because I can't even play anymore on Android. This is BS because iOS users can earn more trophies while we are all stuck with a crashed game.
---
Not really, none of Them are good
---
Crow got nerfed
---
Yes and I rate it 10 blalalblmalmmblms out of 10
---
Now I get it.
---
Yes, he is very concerned about me
---
Let me innnnn!  üò¢
---
This just happened to me too, I got the Welcome Pack and the Level 5 pack back in the shop both of which I've purchased before. Level 72 here.
---
Not complaining though, they're the best offer available by a mile, but very odd.
---
No my friend has a lg and it doesnt work for him
---
:(
---
Yeah its the new gem grab map
---
I have him at 500 trophies and I only play with randoms, quit making excuses. He was extremely strong in the meta and deserved a slight nerf. He is an extremely high skillcap brawler and the fact that YOU do not do well with him does not mean that he is a weak character
---
How please I cannot load my game....
---
I personally think it's hilarious and I can't wait to buy it. You don't speak for what everyone wants
---
i cant ply
---
What if its half a year? 
---
I hate my curiosity that led me to listening to this
---
ive heard all of them from the game files
---
It'll probably be changed when Crow gets a visual update.
---
okay now gene only when u have your super
---
Available at which no of trophies?
---
Except he can't assassinate if he can't charge his super. His range is what it is so he can do minimal poking damage to charge up his super, then he stealths in for his assassinations.
---
No problem 
---
I would hire this guy and fire the other one who create skin which is comming.
---
Ryan did an oopsie
---
Guess who is getting strangled tonight. 
---
Wow, bring that back pls xD
---
Waluigj for Brawl!!!
---
No Problem 
---
Some really bad decisions on this update.  Mortis looks terrible :( so bad.
---
It's not close enough to April fools sadly 8/
---
Hey! You subbed to pewds or not?!?
---
Can you send the group link?
---
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes. 
---
Not working. Doesn't even let to open the app after update. FIX IT!!
---
Galaxy J7 2017
---
I really dont play much with Colt or Jessie for exampleü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Holefully Supercell remoldels it to save the skin. Seriously though, have they never looked at there skin that they're designing? It makes my eye bleed. Nice remodel tho.
---
The dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
---
What a shit job :(
---
its real lol
---
oh no ONE Gem Grab map has a different meta than the rest of the Gem Grab maps that means the whole game is ruined!!!!! stfu
---
Thanks
---
Wow what a difference
---
hahaha üòÇ
---
What visual effects did they actually make for mortis and barley 
---
me
---
Well that are adding a new brawler every 1-3 months like how gene was just released 
---
Somebody mommy must‚Äôve sent him to bed early. You stfu
---
EEEL PRIMOO
---
"Already has two legendarys"
---
I mean that is what it does ahah ü§£
---
Your works are awesome! It makes me envious. If they can‚Äôt appreciate your talent, somebody else will. You deserve more than having upvotes here. Just keep doing what you‚Äôre doing! :)
---
No, Mine works to, and they made a Fixing Update
---
He didn‚Äôt need it at all. Probably one of the most balanced brawlers in the game
---
Yep!
---
When will supercell resolve it ..
---
Its missing the jump pad on your list... would be cool if you could update the items that were in te update lol !!! Thansk for the datamine !!!!!
---
She is your aunt
---
Go into the brawl stars subreddit and hit the 3 dots on the top right, and click change flair.
---
Sadly no, they implemented it in the update before 3D that if you tap on your global profile it would just say ‚Äòthis is you‚Äô, before that you were able to but there was a slight window where I had to see a brawler screen where my tilted Shelly was always first. 
---
That‚Äôs not better than piper at all, piper‚Äôs range is way better than gene‚Äôs which make her so much much better than him, I got piper to 420 as a level 1 it shows you how good and balanced she is, she‚Äôs bad in close range that‚Äôs why she doesn‚Äôt have a super that make brawlers be close to her, gene does and his damage is bad to this close range
---
The puddles look really nice and dangerous
---
i suggest putting night witch mortis in a house and burn it all down with a flame thrower
---
This should do damage
---
This skin is just str8 up hilarious! üòÇ
---
The night witch looks odd, doesn‚Äôt like the one from clash Royale 
---
Can we get some memes over that please?
---
Android users cannot load game that is the problem.
---
If Mortis get a nerf on his star power at least buff him a bit somewhere else,
---
Crow is op now 
---
Is not a big deal because it was so out of rotation and also we have stormy
---
This update sucks. The only visible difference so far is you‚Äôve been shoving modifiers in the faces of those who want to play showdown. Add an extra event slot.... I‚Äôm not spending another dime on this game until I can play regular showdown as it‚Äôs own slot again. Massive design fail .
---
Why me? I just want to play...
---
You mean Shelly?
---
ok, sorryüëå
---
I hope the developers see this and implement it into the game üëç
---
My game crashes every time pls help me 
---
Android doesn't crash for me at all
---
Well, Stormy Plains is back, so I have a hunting ground for Mortis :) 
---
Believe it or not...I think it's good enough
---
NOOOO
---
Its way better but still trash. How about no NW Mortis? 
---
The face looks ugly and wonky on the night witch
---
Any news about the fix?
---
Leon getting the crow treatment.
---
They make you do an el primo jump if you step on them, without the damage and only in one direction.
---
NICE
---
is mortis gay?  
---
Now that Crow is buffed, tell us the name meaning.
---
Carl is a miner in a miner cart.
---
Removed - You have a negative karma score, please fix this before posting again. This action is to prevent spam on the subreddit.
---
Really buff crow !!!!
---
I have the exact same issue ever since the update today
---
As Nita I like launching the bear, and following through from behind.
---
Try to make something original, don‚Äôt steal from an instagram page that stole it from reddit
---
FOH with that P2W battle pass shit
---
Never
---
Nonsense I can't notice any difference when I'm playing it
---
i'm still wondering why does he stole night witch's make up
---
Was just about to say this
---
They updated most beta models and probably are almost done with that and some attacks look kinda basic so changing their graphic could make them standout not only so it looks better also so its easier to know who‚Äôs attacking you
---
It‚Äôs just those feet
---
Boi isn‚Äôt even out yet and we have a good skin idea
---
thank you :)
---
But you are rico... 
---
don‚Äôt worry 
---
Perfection
---
He's not even released but people already have skin ideas for him...
---
The previous version says "New update aviable!" (meaning that I can't play the game until I update it), so I updated it anyways.
---
Lucky? Yes
---
But I think those mythics are better so imo you jumped into the bullets instead of dodging them
---
I would put penny an epic brawler and probably the next new brawler is a rare one
---
I can't get in the game lol it says that the game have an error lol ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
There is so little effort that it looks like you took effort to make it look like it took no effort
---
The "she" gonna look like a knight
---
What's happening with Brawl Stars?It just keep crashing!
---
So true...
---
It's probably a bug just clear datavof play store
---
r/subsifellfor
---
Really buff crow!!!!!!
---
There is only one way to get gems and that is through the in game store using Google play payments or apple payments 
---
Any other way is fake any people sending you links or advertisements saying you can get unlimited gems for free are scams and will try to install malware or steal personal data 
---
That‚Äôs what I thought when I read that it was one 
---
They need you. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry dude but all the stats are already known https://youtu.be/EOCj-2dBzIU
---
*play store sorry lol
---
Same thing is happening to me on moto
---
I really hope its just pitched up like 2 octaves
---
Wow, I‚Äôm 2k and have all but mythical and legendaries.  Bad luck I guess
---
Who‚Äôs better?
---
"SuPerCEll OnLy WanTs MoNeY ThAtS wHy We ArE GeTTiNg NeW BRaWLeRs"
---
Stop crying and be happy we are getting a new (easy to get) super rare!!
---
Next Crow buff ... Hit speed from 1.4 to 1.3999999
---
First game was probably bugged, didn't see any missile and bolt counts didn't seem to reset after building a bot. Or maybe I'm just too tired x)
---
r/woooosh
---
Gene's laugh creeps the hell out of me... Like a killer clown lol
---
I know but that's barely anything
---
New gamemode, something we didn't get in ages.
---
New brawler, always fun right?
---
The do not disturb is something I asked for, very happy to see the bosses listening!
---
Some balance changes I'm happy to see. 
---
What's so bad about it? 
---
oh shit i forgot to put his hat back on
---
There was a punky spike right before sakura spike came in you know...this is just the copy
---
# Holy Cow
---
I love it. I would buy it even if the cost is 150 gems 
---
Pinky*
---
That aint a bug
---
That‚Äôs what I had originally thought üòÖ
---
Go toplay store,my apps and games and update brawl stars from there! Enjoy
---
Nah? Really?!
---
It's MA'AM
---
No a single mythic and frank left and i am at 3.8k
---
Yes..are u new to the game
---
Pls upvote
---
g√ºncelleme sonrasƒ± uygulama hata veriyor l√ºtfen d√ºzeltin
---
what should i classify it under
---
if you won, pretty sure you won't get a brawler, or at least the power of the one you want
---
I actually think a super charge rate buff would be the best way for them to go
---
Go to play store,my apps and games and update brawl starafrom there! Enjoy
---
Oke mijn Nederlandse knakker
---
Frank needs a buff not a nerf. A good player can easily avoid frank all the time 
---
Got my first legendary yesterday at 7.4k
---
It depends on what gamemode lol. But be was only really good at SD or Bounty, and now that the super takes longer now as well, he got even worse. But there was always someone that could do what he did better
---
ill put it as misc
---
I am obviously joking with you
---
0.1 less second makes his DPS go up by a solid 7% tough. Pretty good buff in my opinion!
---
Uninstall and reinstall it.
---
Ik
---
Wasn't it only from like 1.4s to 1.3s?
---
how much does it cost?
---
I piked ur Posts as well makker
---
This is a troll
---
Oh ok
---
But this might be safe since it told us beforehand 
---
Not for me brudder
---
Petition to remodel it and/or give it for free to anyone playing CR
---
Goddammit ryan

Nah I'm already saving up boxes for Carl I won't be opening it until he comes out I also find it more fun to do big box openings then just to open them as you get em

Thanks...but this is already going on for hours...will it happen with every update now?
---
Why not TEST the new updates and maybe release the March update in March when it's save for everyone to install?
---
This quick and dirty attitude doesn't suit a game like Brawl Stars.
---
no he is supposed to be rare not strong.
---
New brawler that came with new update.
---
IT didnt happen to me but does it delete your account? ( I mean i have updated)
---
Totally agreed, he was the easiest brawler to get to 500 imo, and that was a couple months ago. Just gotta learn how to play him, he is very balanced!
---
280 throphies 9100 throphies in total
---
Yes.
---
What is your trophy count out of curiosity?
---
Bratan tu rossia
---
i am just playing it the new gamemode is on
---
Thank god someone remembers the P.E.K.K.A Nita skin idea.....Supercell are u blind?????
---
Same here 
---
What rank is your brawler? Cause trophy gain/loss is different for every rank. For example the blue ranks (15-19) offer 5 per win, 5 per loss, then gold leagues (10-14) offer like 4 per loss but 5 or 6 per win
---
In ios or Android you are playing?
---
That‚Äôs cool and all, but now all I want to see Executioner Carl (Clash Royale)!
---
#STOPTHESPIN TAKE MY DOWNVOTE AND ONCE AGAIN #STOPTHESPIN
---
I said no.
---
r/BoGang thinks this picture is great üëÄ
---
To be fair, I'm at 5k and I only have one epic, one and one mythic. Still missing gene, pam, piper, Mortis, and all the legendaries 
---
Mortis did NOT need this... he‚Äôs still recovering from being kicked out of brawl ball, let him be
---
U can‚Äôt copy someone else‚Äôs post
---
Go to play store,my apps and games and update it from there! Enjoy
---
downvotes incoming
---
it‚Äôs always like that. you lose 12, iirc.
---
Well you clearly use money
---
Yes but Mortis is another mythic and he's one of the best on the actual meta and Tara isn't at the current meta but she slays everyone with her ultimate and she charges it very fast
---
U can‚Äôt copy some else‚Äôs post 2 times
---
Yeah, that's intentional. Look at the change log.
---
My mini is 4K with 19 brawlers üåö
---
Most ppl ste getting +10. Were you the star player and got 12?
---
Got my first mythic after global release (I play since June 2017)
---
Can you not spam the same post 50 time we get it...
---
U can‚Äôt copy someone else‚Äôs post and post 3 times
---
I did it too and still can't play
---
Sorry
---
Such an unnecessary thing to lie about
---
I can't get in the game!!Please fix this!Btw I habe a Samsung Galaxy J7
---
"YeeaaHHH!"
---
Ooof. Plenty of bad here.
---
**Launchpads**
---
I can guess why launchpads were added (it's hugely frustrating to be losing in gem collection and you have almost no chance to help by getting back to the other side if you die).
---
As a general always-on mechanic, they are truly awful. Probably they should only activate once one side has collected 10 gems? 
---
**Seige**
---
People don't seem to understand that they don't have to deliver the bolts anywhere. It's hugely frustrating to see teammates running back to the base line to deliver a bolt. Especially because I'm seeing more and more people doing it (probably because they see other people doing it and think that's what you have to do) and it hugely hurts you teams' collection ability.
---
Same phone same problem
---
i have no choice üßû‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è "*Its backwards time*" 
---
Yeah thanks for telling me! It's updating rn
---
O yeah sorry my bad. But yes thats what i mean. So try this if you want, or wait till the devs do another bug fix. The latest option might be a little safer but could take some time.
---
Siege was hella fun! My team got a lvl 20 Robo, it was fun seeing the other team go panic mode. 
---
doesn't work in finland fuck
---
I wouldn't exactly call them dumb_ass
---
G6 play doesn't work
---
I've already done th√© update. And it doesn't work. 
---
sweet hope it works!
---
Mortis is just cosplaying as the night witch. Plus imagine a proper night witch with Mortis' voice. It'll be so weird (but yeah, it's fugly üòÇ)
---
The Mortis Gang was bamboozled
---
ü§£
---
Crow is fine 
---
Leon.exe has stopped responding.
---
The +10/-10 trophies display is glitched into the trophy image
---
It was accidentally released early
---
I hate this HORRIBLE CR skin. Barley looks awesome as Fire wizard, he is epic! But Mortis is a sad and failest drag queen...
---
Muskiteer Penny, Hunter Bull, Mega Knight El Primo... Literally there are THOUSANDS ideas better than this. There are no reason for this.
---
*Supercell might want to know your location*
---
Pam is pretty solid
---
Yes‚Äî use his range to you advantage by keeping to the complete opposite side of the map of any enemy brawlers‚Äî otherwise RIP 
---
It is just an empty skin slot for future skins, u will find it in every brawler newbie 
---
hey just wanted to let you know i was in the same situation over night and couldn't open the app due to it crashing, however about 10 minutes ago i got an update for brawlstars on the play store that fixed all my issues! check out your play store and your problems might be solved!
---
I was the Barley... thz Jesse :(.
---
Weird flex but okay,
---
Also did supercell add the springs or did you? Bc if so which map maker did you use
---
lmfao that is hilarious, especially when all your teammates take a leap of faith with you üòÇ
---
Brilliant update 
---
also surprised it can launch pam that high too ü§ô
---
me too
---
Yeah such an amazing gamemode literally you need no skills with jessie and pam and pretty much dominated by rng drops of bots. Btw i lost -100 trophies, Such an amazing gamemode i love it
---
The only bad thing is getting matched with shit bulls in this mode
---
Amen
---
I‚Äôd prefer exploding Samsung galaxys

LMAOOOO
---
Yeah I noticed that too. I had flashy green and it changed to light green. I love it!
---
I‚Äôll downvote for a good cause 
---
Barley for sure
---
Did you see my concept for a brawler with a boomerang?üôÉüôåüèª
---
I use gene and when their robot gets close I drag him as far as I can. It helps a lot. 
---
Sounds fun, but I don‚Äôt have Gene :(
---
ITS MA‚ÄôAM!
---
Gene can pull the boss away from the safe. 
---
Sorry for the black screen at the end üòÇ 
---
Bruh my friend with 800 trophies got a Spike today.
---
If you are a high trophy player, avoid the new game at all cost. Best way to see your trophies melt away.
---
Jeez guys calm down ff sake the skin hasnt even fully come out yet besides its suposed to be a jokee and funnyyy andd it delivers on that i think its a great and funny skin even if some parts could be tuned up a bit like the chin but besides thatt its not as bad as a skin as you all say i prefer it over rockabilly tbh
---
Ive won 5 in a row. Nita and Pam worked best for me. Jessie and Penny are decent too.
---
Frank
---
It‚Äôs already nerfed
---
This is sick idea and better than transmortis
---
r/hmmm
---
he can jump to enemy side with 10 gem even not necessary have his super up! PRIMOOOOOOOO
---
You can also try a thrower like barley and suicide yourself when you have your super to do a lot of damage to their safe. 
---
its like piper's cozy nest
---
If you have Spike his super helps to slow down opponents to get the parts. It's more your opponents you have to worry about at first, so brawlers with higher HP are probably better so you don't die as fast
---
try updating
---
its a new way of being an asshole being the gem carrier
---
Have you tried updating or re-installing the game? 
---
If they didn't buffed him everybody wouldn't complain
---
They are cheapstakes like arc
---
I love the voice lines lol. Makes him more like a magic beast
---
We should make a Carl gang
---
RELOAD SPEED DECREASED BY A FUCKING 0.1 SECONDS
---
You didn‚Äôt put the map link
---
Or remove the bar cause he doesn‚Äôt need one
---
You make great skins, so I hope they do too lol
---
nah, when you keep enemies away and poke them, its fine
---
Lmao that's me too, losing 10 trophies per loss. Game mode sounds interesting but having lost 30 trophies in just three matches, I'd rather avoid it at all cost than lose trophies in mass.
---
How about we just keep it how it was before? Or maybe they‚Äôre trying to make it so there can be brawlers with more than 3 ammo slots
---
I‚Äôm at top trophy player and I have lost almost 100 trophies with no wins from siege. Kinda sucks
---
Starred at global too but I spend far too much money on it (and always regret it lol)
---
r/MortisGang 
---
Tip: Don't play this mode with randoms
---
‚ÄúFinally! We‚Äôre 1 step closer to turning Brawlstars into 1 big political message!‚Äù
---
Caaaaarrrrrlll that kills people!
---
Hi I love Brawl Stars and I have a new character idea for this game. His name is cowboy and his normal shoot is a shoot with his revolver and his super is a big powerfull shoot with his revolver. His super can breake walls and his supers range is as long as Pipers normal shoots range. His normal shoots range is as long as Colts normal shoots range. His Star Power is to see enemies (or teammates) shoots. I mean he can see where his enemies shoot. (He can see where his enemies aim) I hope you liked my character advice. I wish you bring him to the game. :)
---
Maybe people use Shelly because people use throwers meaning people like you use Mortis so they want to hard counter? It‚Äôs just mind games
---
I feel you man. It just seems so imbalanced. I was finally able to steal a win with Brock but I‚Äôve lost so damn much.
---
What if u don't have spike?
---
Is this a new brawler or something
---
r/punpatrol
---
Not really Supercell‚Äôs views, just the customer support
---
i keep getting teamed up with players with lesser trophies while the other team has like maxed brawlers and higher trophy count which makes me really made as all i get are losses after losses
---
WELCOME TO MYTHBUSTERS
---
I should change the title haha 
---
Jessie is op. Her bounce shots are worth while in defence and turret to defend. use mortis to collect the bolts
---
What decide do u use?L
---
I want to be part of the Mortis Gang so bad :(
---
Delete this 
---
Thought I was on r/pokemon for 1 second
---
I like it. 
---
Ok may be you forgot that the update needs to be fixed in order for players to review it.
---
Yep
---
Or everyone of your random teammates are attacking directly to the enemy tower...
---
Bull is only viable at close range... Leon does his damage throughout his very large range. Bull is nowhere near op
---
Mano ficam 3 meses enchendo o saco da supercell pra buffar o Crow e quando buffam eles buffam uma coisa que ele era bom e mesmo assim foi de 1.5 pra 1.4 √© 1 mil√©simo man
---
The good old days
---
My friend have same thing, and today my another friend opened Leon with 1000 trophies 
---
I agree with you, this game was created kinda like clash royale, but this time they really listened to the community which formed what we have today. 
---
The clash royale devs have been amazing in the past, but as they slowly stopped listening to the community regarding stuff like balance changes the game has started to die.
---
 Brawl stars is still "young" and they got a good core and ways of adding new stuff. Im a bit worried about this update since it came so quick and we just got a new brawler but i think they know what they are doing, so ill just follow along the way.
---
 They have really done a great work on this game, and its always fun when supercell think outside the box.
---
Yea... At least it looks like the icon
---
Agree
---
Jesus Fucking Christ how did you manage that
---
S√¨ anche "Bombardino" fa schifo come nome (scrivo in italiano perch√© ho finalmente trovato un compatriota ;-;)
---
Lol . its either the best or the worst.
---
It doesn't crash anymore. Thanks!
---
The mode is great ...but sometimes when you have equal bolts (which would result in a tie) it spawns a robot anyway (RNG)
---
Exactly. That's the problem
---
Approved üëç
---
Our Darryl:
---
Loses to piper 1v1 at point blank
---
I think this skin is amazing 
---
Yes they are but at least their high damage is balanced due to their short range. Leon basically has bulls killing ability and hit from range plus be invisible 
---
Gene is ridiculous 
---
Nice üëç
---
An Elon musk skin for mortis
---
Yes it is
---
Crow got buffed real hard recently, so you don't need to worry about it anymore
---
It looks way worse like that
---
Ah thank you! 
---
Thanks :)
---
Title, tried uninstalling but error keeps showing up. Never had anything like this happen before.
---
X
---
Robo rumble exploit Easter egg I guess
---
*also Bo remodel*
---
Put them in bushes
---
Wow, completely original map... üôÑ
---
I discovered this as a mortis in gem grab. It was a sad moment
---
He has over 11k trophies and got this offer. I got it too might be because he updated the game when it was broken
---
Using super to attract to defend base its OP, what u think about gene in this mode?
---
ranged and high dps. frank is okish.
---
I mean that was nice.  But a better title might be "Spike and Colt don't know how to play"
---
ChEcK bUsHeS
---
Tell me about it 
---
No problems for me, it's all good except that thing supercell call a mortis skin
---
What is wrong with its chin. It‚Äôs bigger than the buff he got last update.
---
not me i got 0.0480
---
I cannot. Mortisgang for life
---
Or worse: a Shelly with her super
---
Nice.... Much more effective than my method of putting it in the path of the enemy robot to slow it down briefly.
---
Lmao, trying to play it off. You clearly had no idea 
---
cHeCk BuShEs
---
He told me it was meant to be in humor flare, he changed it now lol
---
You're actually so right lol. If that colt didn't kill the robo for me, I would have died.
---
Yeah, I just called him out for playing it off 
---
It is perfectly FINE on the BETTER os called ANDROID. And we even have brawler sorting
---
piper is pretty great as is tbh, but her star power is meh. would prefer an increase in damage/range when low hp. 
---
Yep i played it off ü§´
---
The dude looks like a minion. 
---
***WAIT YOU ARE ON THE LOSING SIDE???***
---
*super loading noises*
---
Omg this is so good
---
Just delete your dumb post. 
---
Don't mess with me... I don't even own Darryl üò≠
---
I think it's because he is soooo much easier to get and he is also as unique as Mortis with his mechanics
---
What did you do ?
---
My OCD will kill me if they center it.
---
is this an official skin?
---
I hope
---
After the update there's a welcome bundle for 4.99 that gives 2 mega boxes and 170 gems that I could use for an epic. I think I'm gonna pull the trigger and skip my next inkling for a McDonald's visit.
---
They are all captivating ideas!
---
Noo...If You look in mortis's skins it says:night witch Mortis coming in 1 day
---
Exactly ^-^
---
Crow is strong guys, i wonder what you want more? His toxic is killing me easily when keeping poke. You want one hit kill?
---
Losing? Mortisgang has the most followers out of any gang! Besides, a mortis can dash out of a shelly super. Auto-aiming won't save you here.
---
Also the only reason I succeeded here is because there were no Morti. They would have surely defeated me.
---
Whoa that refurbished skin looks sick
---
hiÔºü
---
Will this Night With Mortis throw BATS????? ü¶á 
---
It's korean character designed by korean designer. It's official youtube says korean special skin. And chinese new year is wrong expression. It's luna new year, man
---
Smh don't underestimate Auto Aim...
---
Also, we have won 3 wars so far, while Mortisgang has won 0.
---
tara doesnt need a rework tbh she just needs a skin
---
Or the devs simply didnt notice this when porting over the map
---
Yeah! The only time Mortis is useful is when he is somewhere else!
---
Oh thx.  Why couldn't he just screen his trophy count? 
---
Delete  brawl stsrs data 
---
The only good thing about Siege
---
Not our fault Supercell doesn't support Mortis with quality skins. Even the dynas gave us condolences. Why must shellys be so devious and malicious that they can't even F to pay respects about Night Witch...
---
I feel attacked. 
---
Not Chinese. That is Korean skin.
---
Its already here the update is great (no sarcasm mine doesnt crash)
---
Easy backstabbing option for Carl since they‚Äôll get damaged if they go to close
---
By Shellys with their supers!
---
When you run out of paper and your teacher goes out to cut a tree
---
üòÇüòÇ good question! I think they wouldn‚Äôt have taken his map! They had so many propositions, it was certainly not a big deal not to take someone‚Äôs map if he was disrespectful 
---
Should i get night bitch or token doubler ü§î
---
Chill out my man, you probably just hit 2.5k.
---
ey that‚Äôs me! Look mom I‚Äôm famous!
---
That‚Äôs the point üòÇ
---
*And then he exploded*
---
or his? xD
---
U following meh
---
Creature of the night, I don't feel so good.
---
I mean the idea of a character pulling another character to them is not exactly an original idea from League, plus there‚Äôs like 10 people in league with some kind of hook anyways so they wouldn‚Äôt be copying a particular champ 
---
there were so much good and better skins posted here but they still made this. dont buy it guys. i guess they will eventually understand.
---
I hope its a Troll. They cant be serious
---
It's resulting in unplayable lag, are all the European players asleep?
---
Green is horrible too
---
*sweats* ...no!
---
Good thing you win double trophies
---
Jk how the frick so you win, I‚Äôm always matched with an el primo who chases after Shelly the whole game
---
wHat haPpeNs iF i Go tO tHE enEmY bASe??1?1?!
---
This looks horrifying, let's be honest
---
This took me some time to make. Hope you like it!
---
The new game mode is unbalanced and the risk involved is unreal and not worth the loss. The new Brawler feels like some lazy concept art pulled from a six year old off Reddit. I don't have a problem with DND, don't see why that would be a problem for anyone. 
---
Lol.

My tag is 7 characters, which means that you were around for over a year, if you have an 8 char tag you either came after global or close to global
---
for me personally Dark red was bit Annoying for your eyes to see. This js why they changed it to light pink.
---
So Old...
---
EL PRIMOOOOOOOO !!!
---
actually yeah
---
Wasn't this already made? And if it wasn't good job. Alittel bit more polishing and its really good
---
Ima Dating a glitch that it showed up again, happened to me
---
Is it just me, or ot looks like robbie rotten
---
That's so sick! Great video!
---
I honestly think you should buy it because SC will redo it or remove it and hopefully compensate people.
---
That doesn't look like mortis skin, wasn't that the point of this skin, to make mortis look like night witch
---
Except for the fact that robbie rotten is hot af of course
---
Ik it's an old joke. But i just wanted to make my own version.
---
Sure. But i dont like that fckin negativity. If u dont like. Deinstall. No one will miss u piece of crap
---
This to spare him the torment by downvoting but.. 
---
Lmao dont you dare get this
---
lets not mention the fact that mortis looks like a fuckin crossdresser, and mortis has \*so\* much potential to have cool skins and they gave him this shitty fucking skin
---
*Millions* üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
He? 
---
Por pouco hein
---
Caustic main who's too ashamed to say it :( caustic and crow main. I'm a sucker for getting fucked by developers 
---
Night Witch is my favorite card in Clash Royale-well not just that, she‚Äôs my bae. I don‚Äôt care if it looks uncanny or whatever, she‚Äôs my love and I need to get her.
---
Isn't Mortis cross dressing? So still He I think? An abomination none the less 
---
He is a lot of fun to play!!!! He is not a strong brawler but it is a lot of fun to play with him. I think that's one of the reasons people want him buffed, because its really a fun brawler. Try solo showdown and try to get a victory :) I dont usually play him in duos or 3x3 because i dont want to screw my team mates :)
---
Well like I didn't "steal" this joke. I actually found this joke by myself, but when i started creating this, i realised this was a well known joke. I did create this "Art" if you can say that.
---
It's gonna be a 150 gem one :(
---
Why cant Brock have 4 shots, if Carl (Why is he called Carl? Most of the names have a meaning) can have 1 ammo?
---
token doubler and you'll be safe from HIV

NightüÖ±Ô∏èitch lmaoo

Omae wa mou shinderu
---
wishing to replace this one with the mortis one
---
I feel like she needs either a slight damage boost or a slightly quicker recharge. Maybe it‚Äôs just that she‚Äôs like my 15th brawler so I get way less brawler points than I got with my first few brawlers. 
---
If you don‚Äôt like the risk then don‚Äôt play, simple as that. Many people however will like the high risk high reward, it allows for much greater trophy pushing as long as you win, which is great. 
---
32
---
They just need to make sure they don't go overboard with releasing new brawlers every month or something, or it'll get to a point where no one can level up brawlers quickly enough because of new ones being released all the time. 
---
Both are great change my mind 
---

Can Carl super before his pick gets back?!?
---
oh i did? lmao i just used the magic wand tool. Also, i never knew he had a dick XD

What fun?

But some people wants the skin

Very bad edit, just use a photoshop edit on ur phone and do quick, it's quite good tbh
---
Yee
---
Can I buy leon do you have an Etsy?
---
TBH I would much rather have a faster charging super than faster reload. The reload speed was never the problem 
---
It's a very minor buff when he needs a more major one though. 
---
Looks cool in game
---
It really wouldn‚Äôt be hard to not make him look super feminine, then it‚Äôd be a great skin imo. 
---
Clasy Royale has been doing the same thing for the last 2 months, ever since the golden skin update, and that's never been fixed yet, so I'm not going to hold my breath.

Finally.

What makes it even worse is that there is many great art work and skin ideas on this sub reddit and they make this crap

Nope, she makes a 3x3 or 2x2 (cant remember)

If he has a ranged attack, what‚Äôs the point of getting close to the enemy with his super. Both the attack and super need to work together 
---
El Primo approves this post
---
I‚Äôm reporting this for being repetitive. 
---
Already Been Posted.
---
I don't think so man cuz players still team in these modes 
---
They should pay US gems to get this skin
---
Thanks!
---
I have Android 8.0, using a Galaxy S7, and I get crashes. 
---
Only to close range brawlers.
---
The brawler is not in yet. The skin is in but not available in my store. The new game mode is active in my fourth slot right now, which is the last slot you unlock before the weekly event slot. So if you only have three game slots unlocked you won‚Äôt have access to Siege. 
---
Lv 19 with lv 7 colt. Pretty awesome (but it is hard not to tilt at times.)
---
So do I. I hate the fact that Crow's best mode is SD, where he isn't even in the top 10. Even Piper has her strengths in Bounty
---
Nah, Frank, nita, Jessie and Poco all do well on rockwall
---
I'm so happy with that, very few teaming in sd with modifiers, hope it's 100% like that

Bad day?

It is balanced already IMO, I honestly don't get why so many of you want him buffed lel

Lmao i will give you medal but im too poor

Happy cake day!
---
Just change the skin to not be trash. Isn‚Äôt that simple? Lol. 
---
*This comment was brought to you by Mortis gang sympathizer*

Get good at the game. If you let a bull get close enough to kill you it's your fault

I would buy this skin instead of Nightwitch Mortis for sure
---
Oh yes
---
i‚Äôm so sorry
---
Pretty sure your main is a thrower
---
Took me forever 
---
Don't you dare
---
The length of a match combined with horrible randoms you get matched help make this mode  it enjoyable at all. Gonna be another mode you don‚Äôt solo queue unless you like losing 6 trophies each time. 
---
I think people should get over it
---
I currently have more than enough gems. 
---
*COIN DOUBLERS*
---
more like demon
---
How i can fix?
---
Yes exactly
---
Piss robot
---
Just make a prettier woman version of this skin ;-; make mortis a girl rather make him a crossdresser omegalul
---
Hmm 
---
Trans?More like sans!
---
I think Carl looks like Wall-E and Dyna combined tbh
---
After update (2/27/2018) game play is SUPER CHOPPY! I thought maybe it was just growing pains for the new Siege mode, but it's the same for all game modes. 
---
I closed all apps, played outside with clear skies and full signal, restarted phone and have tried multiple times today to no avail.
---
Any suggestions?

---
what about pam sp, its just as bad if shes aggressive
---
im so stupid.i thought why are they making a new night witch mortis skin based on cr.i just realised this is  because night witch has bats motis has bats.i play clash royale and night witch was my first legendary but i still didnt realise
---
no, Gene's current voice is a unique thing because he can not be identified about what he's talking about, and he's funny too
---
What‚Äôs funny about it tho ü§î
---
#Cough cough
---
Not as bad as night witch Morris
---
Robert Kraft will do it for $10
---
Thats so perfectly crafted I wish I could give you gold
---
Honestly they cud get so much money from me for skin ideas like this. Alot of people came from clash royale and are still feeling nostalgic. Hell the wizard barley was dope. which was a premium skin imo. Make more like thatttttt.
---
Problem is, not all players always have two friends online ready to play. With this method people could also play balanced games with a team of randoms.
---
Just don't click both of them at the same time
---
El Primooooooooooooo! 
---
I like the idea
---
What the fuck
---
Carl is a super rare
---
It already was my nightmare
---
Not even having Mortis&gt;Having this skin for Mortis

Imagine not being able to imagine because of being a plant
---
This post was made by Spike gang
---
Thx üòä
---
Your enemy had Brock , Jessie and Penny all range shooters wish the could have easily gotten your mortar.But, instead the rushed like idiots forgetting there is some shooting at their base..
---
Yea lets fly to that poison
---
10/10
---
No, they shouldn't, that thing is scary
---
She‚Äôs a bringer of bats and a creature of the night so I mean, makes sense but needs a remodel
---
So we just going to ignore the mortis Nerf
---
In the current map nuts and bolts he is really good, the stun can not only stun an attacking enemy siege bot but he can also go behind a friendly siege bot and stun the turret, allowing the bot to get more damage on the enemy turret. 
---
I've been getting the worst teammates for siege. I had a gene who would just camp at the base and never go for bolts, then he would use his super on primo. 
---
Great now you made him OP
---
Since we are posting our opinions here I will go with something a guy in this sub:
---
Make Crow Super ''reset'' everytime he kills someone with it or within a small time frame, √† la Kha'zix from LoL
---
Can confirm, Was In Game
---
I hope this is real so that supercell will change the f-ing skin it looks so bad my god...
---
savage
---
Crow is fine, Leon and spike need nerfs still 
---
Yeah you are actually right but it's a cart so they can't have a baby with itüòÇüòÇ
---
**loses 15 games in a row**
---
I like this post not the skin
---
I would really love to see some tier lists for this game mode from KairosTime or Lex
---
Supercell wants to be a money hoarder. Gene buff makes people want to buy it more, similarly to what they did with Leon.
---
Good old days

Am I the only one who likes rockabilly mortis?

Lol, thanks

Mortis isn't a girl, it's just a skin.
---
He means every time it comes up in cycle, like today.
---
Gene is underpowered! *gives gene 5 buffs* crow is underpowered *wow reload speed 0,1 s decrease wow such buff*
---
Koreans are fake Chinese 
---
all two voices are good, they make the Character characteristics. Gene for example, in his "laughter" he says something, and Frank is Frank.
---
buff crow
---
Y‚Äôall need to pay my ass to equip that.
---
thanks man
---
They can fix it to make it look better
---
Oh NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
We need to get the care packages for our civilians.
---
This map is Shelly super spam
---
I think they should change it back. It could be too powerful.
---
It‚Äôs good but needs some reworks
---
‚Ä¢ make it so you need to bring the bolt back to your base to avoid camping mid
---
‚Ä¢ bolts should be less random with how they spawn
---
‚Ä¢ when a robot is made the enemy team should lose at least half of their bolts (or, lose bolts as theirs loses health)
---
Besides that I think it‚Äôs ok. But these are a lot of big changes the mode needs 
---
Nah man, this may get the mortis gang on my case but rockabilly is probably my favorite mortis
---

Maybe like a dmg nerd would be in place. Also delete his star power *nods in supercell*

I'm talking about the remodels, the Skin of Death only needs a little remake to make it look more like a witch.

---
Well we got spring traps and mortis traps, what will be next? 
---
Seconded. Poison is countered by healers in the same way that distance characters beat close range ones on an open field. Learn to account for your character‚Äôs weaknesses. Crow needs a buff, but massively inflating his damage like that is NOT the way to go about it.

10 is WAAAAAAY too much. I played once and decided the risk isn't worth it.

It‚Äôs obvious that‚Äôs why the skin was made. But that doesn‚Äôt justify it. That‚Äôs like them saying the Crow ‚Äúbuff‚Äù was for fun and people be like ‚ÄúOh yeah makes sense now, sorry.‚Äù A bad skin design is a bad skin design.

Yeah I got it too. I purchased and got gene. Worth it for 5 bucks
---
What app is that?
---
Just make it large to match other bars
---
Profitable
---
Sorry for last comment, I have updooted it btw
---
Ce e?
---
?

Idky i didnt stop .... the rage play took over me once again

As a new Crow main for the past couple days Here‚Äôs some of his main advantages and disadvantages that I‚Äôve discovered in the sub-300 bracket:
---
Advantages include: 
---
Crow can hide in bushes as well as most Brawlers.   
---
Crow has the best base skin.  
---
Phoenix Crow is the best skin.  
---
To join Crow‚Äôs gang you have to peck out a cat‚Äôs eye. How cool is that?  
---
Crow has A-tier voice emotes.   
---
Decent reload speed.    NOW BUFFED OMG. 
---
Crow is not scary like the giant crows in Japan.  
---
When you die but then the poison ticks kill them! Sure they got a higher rank but it still feels good.  
---
Disadvantages include:  
---
Doing damage to other Brawlers.   
---
Surviving other Brawlers much higher Damage.   Opening Chests.   
---
Charging Super.   
---
Using Super effectively.   
---
Poison not stacking. 
---
White crow is a huge downgrade.  Wait til all the people crying about Witch Mortis unlock crow and realize just how bad white crow is, sub will be a bloodbath that week. 
---
So there you have it. This buff is ok and helps crow open chests and maybe get that last shot off before the enemy cycles.  True you‚Äôre probably still dead but not every character is optimal in solo play. 
---
That's crazy this was on my mini account tooüòÇ
---
2 friends have a legendary at 1500... It's killing me
---
Hey could you add the siege game mode map size format to your map editor. I wanna play around with some ideas. Like having the neutral zone look like it‚Äôs boxed in. And to have a map where it‚Äôs possible to deal some damage to the safe/turret by doing it from the side. Because it is possible to be in the back of the map in the corners and it would be interesting if you can sneak back there and do some(emphasis on some) damage if you can‚Äôt get a robot and need to do some damage to win by some percent. Basically i wanna play around with some of these ideas and make some new maps for the new game mode. 
---
The meme is therapist
---
A buff is a buff regardless.
---
EWWWWW! WHY DID THE NAME COLORS CHANGE?
---
As a member of the mortis gang I'd totally buy your design (If I have enough gems lol). Supercell's design tho I wouldn't pay that more than 30 gems.
---
would not have....
---
Are you?
---
I don't think that's supposed to happen though ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Just a primo photo bombing the picture
---
Maybe, it could also just be a typo
---
Honestly all this "teaming" stuff is nonsense. One person does not represent the entire community. This applies to all gangs, not just dynamike or mortis.
---
yes i had that happen yesterday
---
the new game mode got me to tilt 40 trophies....
---
It's bad enough dieing first on showdown, but the losses on Siege are just insulting! Do they want us to actually feel like we're making progress? It's getting frustrating to end up a play session with fewer trophies than I started with. I just need some friends instead of randoms :(

Petition for gangs to stop being weak as hell and relying on others 
---
I did
---
I pulled off a 36 ;))
---
Most likely autocorrect but it still fits in the sub
---
Let's see if this comes true...
---
I like the idea but this map seems to bland. All I would ask for is more separation of the safe and those blocks that represent the archer towers. And add one or two walls that are like 2-3 tiles from the water. Simply one or two cover walls then the rest would be open. It just looks like an artwork map not a game map right now. I do believe you could do some stuff to make it more interesting for gameplay but still looking like a CR map.

My club member is zacsk√≥stej get Leon on 800 thropi
---
I know, but therapists are doctors too. 
---
I want the same
---
BuT ThERaPisT ArE DocToRS
---
Or people playing ultra weak characters jumping into their doom. Alone. WITH 12 GEMS.
---
It is a fun mode but honestly it doesn‚Äôt worth it.. I lost 8 per match with a rank 13 Jessie just to get 10 to the one match I won for my star.. honestly I don‚Äôt feel like touching this mode again 
---
Dont u fucking call him an abomination.
---
HE IS BEAUTIFUL!!

Get tf outta here
---
Petition to add ***Sexy Mortina*** as a user flair
---
I think that the idea is pretty cool because of the bats mortis has when he uses his super, but the actual skin looka kinda weird
---
What a salty noob lmao. 
---
Let me respond to this with my own points and address your points. Take my opinion as you will. 
---
*New Brawlers* While the quick release of Carl right after Gene was a surprise, I don‚Äôt think it should be seen as too fast. As long as new characters released are well balanced, the addition of new characters is healthy for the game. As for the PTW aspect, someone buying a brawler does not mean they will be skilled with that character. Currently, all characters have relatively good counters, so any person who buys a character will most likely not be skilled with them, and the possibility of being countered by other brawlers works as almost a balance.
---
*Bo Remodel* That was a joke, Bo remodel will most likely be coming soon.
---
*Teaming* I agree with you that yes, teaming is extremely annoying. But, before grabbing your pitchfork and torch and marching to the supercell headquarters, take a moment to think from there perspective. How would you propose they prevent it? Could a report feature be abused? Supercell needs to be very careful if they plan to implement a report system.
---
*Tilting* Simple answer here; if you start to lose a couple games, switch the game mode, switch your brawler, reevaluate strategy, or simply take a break.
---
*Siege* This is a new game mode, so strategies are still forming, if it‚Äôs trophies your worried about, you could find a good team on the discord server, or you could not play the game mode. Sucks that the stakes are so heavy, but unless there is more outcry, things might not change for awhile. 
---
You mean lose 12 trophies? 
---
Sorry really late but I searched for this. I‚Äôm having this exact issue right now. Did you ever find a solution?
---
Basicly to pull someone you have to make sure you have damage to kill him. In showdown for me it's very hard to use because of that, unless you can pick a lot of power cubes. Gene is most likely to use on 3x3 modes when you depend on your teammates to kill the enemy.
---
I noticed that
---
The in-game effects are cool but the designs are ugly
---
The problem is that after the last robot the team that didn‚Äôt get the robot has a bunch of extra bolts with no purpose
---
 Your lack of humor is disrespectful 
---
The new map format is coming! I got it in already, just need to make a stable version ;) I do think the turret radius is a set number though, so you probably won‚Äôt be able to sneak in from behind!
---
Ah okay, thank you! May I ask where you have this information from? Just observed it ingame or official Supercell info?
---
No counter in the corner shows the bolts in hand too
---
The skin
---
That skin looks sooo bad. They need to redesign it.
---
They might tweak it before the event. Perhaps we can make suggestions for them... ;)
---
Maps with 1 tile gaps were reworked to not have them.
---
please I had a good idea of ‚Äã‚Äãskin for brawl stars, the mega knight el cousin, if you can use this idea, thanks for the attention.
---
??? Leon can become invisible, is faster, and has much bigger range. That is fair balance
---
I was testing the new mechanic on Gene. They recently changed him, you can now super through walls. I went into a game with bots to test it out so it didn't really matter who I pulled.
---
Some people will enjoy it win or lose cause they just like to play. Some will not play cause they don't like the risk.  Some only play with friends and club mates and will play and win quite often.  It's your choice to play or not.  Just maybe without all the colorful language.
---
If by "most of us" you mean just you and a handful of people with congential brain defects then yes, "most of us" prefer mega box over star power. 
---
Lovely*
---
What does Bo have to do with this?
---
Now mortis wont be saying i am a creature of the night but i am a bitch of the night
---
This is gold
---
I lose 10 with my 16 and 17 and over rank brawlers
---
*uwu*
---
They are called bots m8
---
stop... Im crying in the work bathroom now
---
They should‚Äôve made it a male counterpart of the night witch to fit, not trans Mortina 
---
Lost 20+ trophies with this update 
---
-12 trophies
---
It is the most luck depented out of all 3vs3 modes. It is the longest. You can have aadvantage by losing, because you keep your scraps... it's obviously objective but I think that this mode needs some improvements
---
How do you get her?
---
here i'll give you an upvote
---
Haunt fits, it probably was intended
---
The best part of this map is playing as Shelly and Supering someone immediately after they get launched off of the launch pad. With that kill, I get my Super again and do it over and over
---
I hate to go back 10 years to best describe Siege. Gayyyyyyyyyyy
---
I think they give you a couple of seconds and if you are still alive, then the bolt you collected automatically goes to your base. 
---
&gt; ¬øTienes un problema? 
---
yup
---
what??
---
There is a new brawler lol
---
Its so fucking horrible. I will make it my mission to hunt down all these skins with my hat Mortis!
---
I didn‚Äôt hear about him getting a voice and I opened up his info and had a panic fueled laughing fit.
---
Shush
---
That's pretty accurate
---
Nobody likes modifiers. Only life leech had a good amount of fans and was the only one that did somethin against teaming and well.... hm I guess from today instead of 60% showdown is now 70% luck...
---
Uninstall the game and reinstall it. That's how I fixed the problem
---
Not trying to be rude, but what's the strategy..? Am I missing something? 
---
That's karma, yeet
---
I know the map is called Spring Trap, but why aren‚Äôt people calling the actual trap a push trap from Clash‚Äôs builder base?
---
It was a good idea but poorly executed
---
Nice 
---
Even worse than Mortis without a hat
---
The skin is pretty ‚Äúmeme‚Äù just that chin it kinda irks me
---
I was beautiful...
---
That's what I'm talking about... "Exclusive"...
---
It shouldn't be exclusive, there's no point. Just to make harder for each of these plataform users to get each others skins?
---
And if you think it's that easy to iOS users to get Android skin and vice-versa, then what's the point of making it exclusive instead of just... giving both skins for everyone? See? No point in doing it, waste of time. 
---
Supercell: What if we combine our games together? Fans would like that!
---
Fans: Wow, that seems so cool!
---
Supercell: *Has Night Witch Mortis exist*
---
Fans: Nevermind
---
He‚Äôs literally a ‚Äútoxic assassin‚Äù and that‚Äôs how you‚Äôre supposed to play him. If you want control you should pick up barley or Jessie or something
---
It was beautiful 
---
It's good when you have no gems, because you can just jump in there then use your Shelly super for 3 consecutive times.
---
1d8h
---
More like $39.99
---
Sounds like something night witch mortis would say.
---
check buShes!! it's your entire fault you never even check bushes. shelley and bull are meant to be shotgunners. Shotgunners. close range. learn how to counter them.
---
To be honest, it should maybe be a ticketed event, giving tokens, not trophies
---
Look, I don't have Crow so I don't know if he is really that bad or if he is actually good.
---
You have to have Mortis to even get the offer for this skin. When popcorn Rico came out I had the deal on my main with all brawlers except 2 legendarys and gene, but not on my mini account with no super rares 
---
I believe showdown now stays in one box, even with the mods. Heist and Bounty share a box, and now Brawl Ball and Siege share one.
---
You mean, the night demon... I still have nightmares yo 
---
Yeah that makes sense actually. Good point. 
---
This is fake he had 15 gems.
---
Also can I just say hoe op this makes barley.
---
Your finger or your leg or your the middle?
---
let's take it down 12 notches or so
---
The link doesn't work fyi
---
Is this a troll? Where are the rules?
---
Perhaps he's a lot more viable at top levels of play, but for 90% he's hands down the worst brawler in the game. 
---
true...
---
They had better options like fire spirit spike or mega knight el primo, but no, make Mortis look like a trap. I‚Äôm not called that beast Mortis anymore, it‚Äôs new name is Morgay.
---
Ew she looks nso ugly
---
Yes pretty accurate, but with 3v3s and dumb random teammates who jump in the enemy spawn with 20 gems
---
Thanks for your art post! If you are not the creator of this work, please make sure that you have included the source, or to  comment it here! Unsourced art may be removed if you are not the creator.
---
yeah a loss on this is more tham a 10th on showdown
---
10th on showdown should be the ultimate shame
---
Not out yet, but yet, it shouldn't since it is a disgrace
---
WAAAAAAAH!
---
How did you got 3 of the same brawlers?
---
Wait 1d 8h 
---
Sure, they might be from a different universe. But that won‚Äôt stop the wizard from sending other things from his world to Brawl Town, just like his robe
