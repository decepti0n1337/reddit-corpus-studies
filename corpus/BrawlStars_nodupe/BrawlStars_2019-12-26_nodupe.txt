This art ia from fnaf and brawl stars?

Not good because some brawlers are way better then. Others say if u have all brawlers unlocked except legendaries then it would be way to easy for someone to unlock legendary brawlers
---
Why?
---
Yep I waited until 8:30
---
Cute :)
---
Lol I have rank 30 power 1 crow

This is 100000x better than the original. I hope supercell sees this u/Brawlstars u/Dani_Supercell u/Frank_Supercell u/Ryan_Supercell
---
I‚Äôm actually really disgusted about this.
---
Don't attack it, kill it
---
Nice but try to shape the head better and still you‚Äôre very creative
---
yet there are 10x more inexperienced players than there are experienced so...
---
There's a good chance this is unique! I checked 88,134,358 image posts and didn't find a close match

The closest match [is this post](https://redd.it/c5bcpk) at 70.31%. The target for r/Brawlstars is 86.0%

Dude cuz it's a legendiary not some rare brawler plus what's the point if it's cheap cuz it would feel like a rare brawler as a reward now shut up now your just lazy and probably don't wanna wait anymore and I get it but then it would be too easy cuz the mecha skins are worth those star points and I say a legendiary brawlers is a little less worth it and it would also prove that you were determined and worked hard for it

Naw mate this one starts with the "Me:"

While the other starts with the catchphase. So it looks like he unintentioally used the exact meme remplate for the same joke. This happens some to time due to great minds thinking alike. I think OP just got unlucky and never saw this post, but I believe he's innocent.

Ahh yes, I can already sense the brock's and pipers
---
#DAMN THESE SHELY LEGS ARE THICCC
---
Every brawler specializes in a certain role and in certain maps. Sandy is the easiest to "master". and Spike is the hardest but he's flexible, proficient at close and far range, as well as hitting opponents behind walls. I'd recommend Spike, it'll be a trip to play with him, let alone unlocking him, but it'll be worth it in the long run.
---
I like it! Nice
---
It was the best piece of crap
---
Notice what

But he could be looking at anyone of our memes right now

I feel like in that situation you are in the right

Ok so my friend told me to post this on reddit. I personally told him that no one cares and it wont get any upvotes but he said just give it a try so I did and during this conversation I pusbed about 200 trophies :) which was like 2 hours
---
Are people calling him Chet now?
---
Dude your a Skelton you don‚Äôt even have a penis anyways.
---
Why are you keep whining about the price? Did i ever said a legendary should cost 15k? The concept is not just about the cost of a legendary

The point is 5 Yr olds auto aim

Very funny art. Love the Mortis's action as it really represents his attitude. Award worthy. üôÇ
---
I do this because I'm power 1 and I am physically incapable of killing people at 600 trophies+

Very cool!

So I have been playing Mortis for around 2 months now and I had always wondered why top hat Mortis never appeared in shop.

Was Old RICO a one time offer ?

I think they should change it so instead of killing people for health you can hit people and get health back.No idea how to balance.
---
Auto aim doesn‚Äôt work in the slightest for tick, his attacks take way too long to even become damage, but cornering can become useful after a while so you have me there

Mortis team together, but do not work to take down brawlers together as they would harm each other. Instead, Mortis just ignore other Mortis. Only in solo tho. In duos, they show no mercy.
---
Just an ad.
---
Why was it a mistake? I don't see any harm to it, having a limited skin for free every year sounds cool.

crow is just a point ahead from sandy whennyou talk skill. crow is all spam shooting

Can we fix brocks main attack. It's anoying when I hit The Wall. Or wait maybe I just have to stop fucking auto aim. Waisting Mortis amo is a mistake noobs pften do.

your lucky you dont have a 949 brawler then so no i dont feel the pain

I can't say that it really happens to me but when it does it is important to not miss a shot sooooooooooo my idea is to make him able to dash to the other side if a max of 25% of his dash hits the wall

Hit 25% and you will stay there,on the same side,thinking how you could just killed that 254 hp Rico if you would just dashed on him directly and eventualy stop thinking

---
HOW DOES THIS HAVE ONLY 5 UPVOTES?!
---
Idk why People do that. Unless there are throwers near by, there is no point in teaming with a Mortis. I was once a 6 powercube Carl, and there were 2 others left. I 6 powercube Nita, and a no powercube Mortis. I kept trying to attack the Mortis, but Nita decided to pick a fight against me instead for no reason. We fight, I win, and just as I suspected the Mortis comes, finishes me off and takes 1st. It's such bullcrap that people would rather have players that actual play the game get 3rd, while a Mortis just stands there, does LITREALLY nothing, and gets 1st.
---
But he's still a reaper vampire
---
Pretty cool!
---
If you like play 3vs3 buy sandy ,if you like showdown or present plunder buy leon

clam hahaha

Everyone knows that

If I could I would give mortis to a game friend. Because playing mortis for me is a no go. üôàüéÑ

You‚Äôll get the mythic if you get spike in ur next brawl box :)
---
This! It pisses me off seeing no powercube players towards the end because it usually means they were either a) bush camping or b) doing nothing the entire time and running away. If I see that there are more players left than the ones visible then I make it my duty to kill them because they do not deserve that place and it‚Äôs unfair to the people who actually fought and died trying

Wow that's unlucky

no. dyna is good but it's difficult to aim with him compared to other throwers.  and this is just a montage.  you don't want to be wasting ammo to jump around all the time.

This comment was made by Leon gang
---
yeah i was inspired from fnaf
---
Ask u/coachflapjack
---
Me!
---
Also just here are better ideas
---
Damage (mortis) - 1360
---
Brock health-to just like penny, jessie, (brock with 4 rockets s not treat to mortis just charge the dawn super from others and thats it brock is OK).
---
Also coiled snake rduced charge time to 2,5 seconds or 2 seconds(you can chose).
---
I loike no hat better nice art tho
---
First off, what you describe as 'there is no gambling, odds are given' is exactly what gambling is. You have a game, and odds (for example a chance to win something).
---
Of course you always know that in every box you get gold and power points. That is indeed not quite gambling, because you're guaranteed to get them in each draw. 
---
However, getting brawlers in a box is a matter of either you get one, or you don't get anything. And these boxes can be purchased with real money. THAT is gambling. Even if you can't cash out your winnings, it's still the same principle how slot machines work. Introducing children to this type of gambling is very immoral and may even get some of them addicted to gambling in the future where they're old enough gamble legally. 
---
Clash royale has a higher chance of pulling a legendary card, but you still need to pull the same card over and over again to level them up. Brawl stars doesnt have that, because power points are always guaranteed.
---
I actually think clash royale did it better with the higher odds of pulling a legendary, because then you at least have the option to play with them and deciding what to do next.
---
You defending supercells business practice that involve introducing children to literal gambling is disgusting and immoral in so many ways.
---
Oh u will kno. Minus my team mate trophy seems they suck at games

World of Warships?
---
I wouldnt nerf other brawlers just because of mortis. You risk throwing off the balance with those brawlers then aswell. Increasing mortis' damage suffices. 
---
Coiled snake is good as it is. It doesnt need a better load time, since coiled snake is already the go-to starpower for mortis. Creepy harvest also needs a rework
---
I agree with most of this
---
maxine is weak so she deserved it
---
It‚Äôs only 3 gems. Plus it‚Äôs like a 1/10 chance per day. It‚Äôs not a bad idea

Yes please. Its instant death for mortis. With his super slow recovery

congrats!!!! :D

One if the vest skins in the game

I mean the closer you are the more damage you take!

Strategy with Jessie is to load your super and use scrapy to attack Boss.

I should‚Äôve mention I enjoy Sharpshooters better but Nita is good in so many modes

They actually did address this in Behind Brawl Talk  they said you can have great WiFi and still have the game Spike it may not be the connection or maybe so or it being the delay of the server's and you cannot fix lag it is impossible too fix a WiFi issue it works fine for me soo maybe restart or reset the router

As i said;) lukiebear is da beat

It's an ethical issue mate not a legal one. I'm perfectly happy if the parents are making sure that it's controlled. You use an in-game currency that you can obtain by yourself. If they can't distinguish the risks of in-game 'gambling' (there is no alternate way to spend it so the risk factor cannot be disposed of) from the risks of real life currency being gambling, then that's on the parents not supercell.
---
Incredible as always

Making your own watermark sill doesn't make it believable I know you had took it from a other person making other people think that it is the real one don't take other peoples credit make your own oraginal memes instead of taking at least give credit to them

Spinning is only rude when the people you just killed was minding it‚Äôs own business, if someone steals your power cube, follows you the whole match, tries to kill you uncountable times, would you really resist spinning if you kill it?

How did u get the skin? Im at 17k and have 26000 starpoints

Where do you hear memes in carls voice?

Okay now it's their parents fault out of the sudden? If a child gets addicted to gambling from a game that is not rated mature then it's totally the parents fault and not supercells/ESRBs? 
---
What are you exactly trying to prove here? Why are you trying to deny literal gambling in a game rated for a younger audience? Are you just here for the sake of disagreeing or what?
---
That would be just so highly unbalanced.
---
The meta for brawl ball will then favour only long range brawlers. Btw good imaginationüëçüèª

Only 7yrs old Boys would write this. Hahahahahah omgash its 69, so funny.

but I don't talk about it, I talk about how mortis faces others if he doesn't stand out at all and don't say in brawl ball because we have others like max, leon, ir Bibi and Brock with the 4 rocket

Even not big jessie jessie is not one of the best for heist brawlers right now.

Hope to see more real soonüëçüèΩ

Sandy alone is actually quite the treat
---
Spike's a medium threat, alongside with Leon
---
Crow isn't a threat, he's more of..annoying his enemies with poison, but yeah, he's a threat, but not as deadly
---
Still, I respect you for speaking up..
---
1.5 seconds spinning-&gt; a waste of time
---
Then I say you buy ambush
---
Well, you could have worked better with the textures and the models, but its a good concept.
---
Also, if it is a mod, it should not replace existent mobs.

Not all brawlers were created to fit all game modes. That's what I say

Fine, you win

How do people know that it is the world record? Is there any website I can check out to see the highest number of trophies for each brawler?
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more.
---
But I kicked it after she did her super, then she passed it back to me, then I kicked it. Does that mean that when Shelly is using her normal attack, balls can phase through if at the right timing?

You spelled bird wrong .Instead of bird you wrote berd

Old of course

Curveball got nerfed, fertilize got buffed.

The higher you go up, the more I‚Äôd switch around. But the bottom half is pretty spot-on. Especially the last one haha

Kisses back

Firstly you are RUDE and i challenge you to draw sandy (Dont look on ƒ∞nternet i didnt and if you lie you are a...)
---
W-Wait! That's my quote!
---
Or dont get help from photo or from Brawl Stars
---
It is kind of, the primo is more than 100 trophies below you
---
Old
---
Max is the fastest sprinter, that cannot be denied
---
If you wanna spend money I highly recommend buying the new Christmas deals (got sandy,Bea,and Spike)
---
It‚Äôs a joke
---
Firstly i didnt know english pretty well and you have to respect i bet you are an 5 year old
---
Hablaha
---
Nop. They just want everyone who keeps complainin about how hard is to get a legy to shut up. They gave the offer and is 1 gem cheaper than the new mythic.
---
Crow is in offer and Max in normal price

I lost because of thisüò≠üò°

In every single BS post, with fake promise (i will subs to anyone who subs me) üòè

Haha! I just scored!
---
I have 7 brawlers but I refuse to upgrade them I'm saving for when I can upgrade nita or leon my 2 favorite brawlers
---
Crow is really strong now its irritating
---
Right here
---
I just posted it u... YOU DONT HAVE TO BE RUDE JUST LOOK A ANOTHER MEME. IF YOU DONT KNOW MEMES ARE HERE TO ENTERTAIN PEOPLE
---
Just shut up, a legendary brawler costs 700 gems and super give discounts on legendary to make then 349 and therefore legendary have more value, stupid kids
---
Yeah i just kinda put the ones with skillshots up top
---
Not so difficult
---
Yeah because he is the only one who you can't play like a shotgunner in Brawl Ball üôÑ Crow is hella strong but most of the time you aren't fully realising it. You barely ever know the Star Power an opposing maxed Crow got equipped, you gotta look super close to see the little red arrows for extra toxic.
---
Most of the time you don't realise you are doing - 20% Attack damage but it really cripples your finishing ability, no matter what Brawler you are playing.
---
Crow is stupidly underrated.
---
Santa Barley more like Red Wizard Barley
---
Uhm no i didnt said that theres an old bo?
---
Yes, please!
---
good* I told you* take* (?)
---
no you're wrong its

Tick  + Frank = frick
---
Really ? Is this in the forums if so can you link it to me please ?
---
Idk, i like colt‚Äôs voicelines because he‚Äôs supposed to be very arrogant, like how you rated emz
---
Bo got a remodel right? So there should be two boys if he did both new and old models of all brawlers, but there‚Äôs only one bo got that?
---
Absolutely no
---
mortis?
---
When will you learn that your actions have consequences
---
Same was with me don't cry you just have bad luck time 6 months without any new brawler (exclouding trophy road) and then leon spike gene mortis and crow with in 2 months

well he's right

this is impossible cause you see 1 shot divides into 3 robots i matched all the pairs for 3 but there is 1 bot missing from so it means it could have hit another bot which will destroy another bot. Am i right?

Happy cake day!

But how??

He also needs his super

I‚Äôve actually been in this situation before myself. All i had to unlock was a mythic and the legendaries. I unlocked mortis (the only mythic i had left), and my legendary drop rate went down from around .06... to .01. So yes unfortunately it does affect the legendary drop rate. This is why i was wanting this to be changed so that if you unlocked a mythic, it wouldn‚Äôt affect your legendary drop rate.

Soooo, a gunbrella?

Honestly wouldn‚Äôt he be exactly that, he is Nitas little brother right?

Pretty lucky but then capitalised quite well.

Spinning like that is just a dick move.

Yeah but on first glance and having a kit based on stealth the idea of loud and annoying kinda clash

Take your upvote and GTFO

That is true, honestly his kit fits a more quiet voice while his design once you think about it (and lore) fit the annoying brother. But tbh because you‚Äôre loud and annoying you can‚Äôt accomplish the task either (luckily, imagine you‚Äôre hiding in a bush and suddenly you hear Leon say something but he‚Äôs nowhere to be seen)

---
Trophies can be deceiving. 2 people can have the same trophy total but if one has played longer, then they would have likely opened more boxes giving them a better chance to unlock brawlers. 
---
I just hit 13k but I don‚Äôt play every mode so someone else at 13k who grinds every event will be opening more boxes than me and probably have a brawler or 2 that I don‚Äôt.

No. Rockteer just says how his design is. "Sniper" that says what you can expect from Brock. Especialy if brawlers like Bea and Piper would have it. You would immediately think "oh, long range, single projectile, hight DMG". You know what I mean?
---
What is the bottom text supposed to mean?
---
u/koisuiko
---
Buddy, it is not that simple. You have to be extra critical/nice to the voices by how you feel about them. If everything was a 7/10 this would be a sad list without a purpose. With good voices like Mortis, the only way to distinguish a 10/10 and an 8/10 is by *how* good they're done, which means including more, as I call it, sweet talk. If you don't like it then just don't comment.

Daum i actually understood that

It only feels good to you. Imagine someone spinning on you for no reason after you die and lose 7 trophies. It‚Äôs immoral and immature.
---
Leon‚Äôs long range damage is bad. It‚Äôs only used for chip damage. To stop people from healing, and if they‚Äôre low, it‚Äôs to get a kill. And for Rosa, she has a faster movement speed except for Darryl, bull, frank, el primo, Bibi, sandy, max, mortis, Leon, and crow. She catches you slacking because she can catch up to you and punch you to death.

Endorphones arent half as strong in a fucking game? Where is your source on that? Never heard such bullshit in my life before.

I'm not dumb to understand that 'they say it in their Terms of service'. I am criticizing that, nothing else. There is a definitive line between accepting something and criticizing it. It's called freedom of speech. You don't get any of my points. You try to disprove my arguments with anecdotal viewpoints and never even reply to my arguments directly. I wonder if you even read the articles i linked.
---
You are a disgusting human being, thats all. You defend gambling in a game that is rated for children. You're fine with children being introduced at an early age to addictive behaviour. And then saying 'Oh the odds are given, if you don't like it then dont play it' doesnt mean a single shit. I don't care what the odds are, it is and is going to be gambling no matter what. Nobody really has an idea how dangerous gambling can be. Everyone glorifies it as something fun and harmless, but the reality is rather horrifying.
---
Gambling is addictive just like drugs. There is a reason why casinos only allow adult people and drugs are not allowed for underage people. Get this in your head. I am not talking about myself, Im talking about the millions of children playing this game.

When you find a team with üîé, you can't communicate using the chat, only with built-in sentences and emotes. You can also suggest brawler (and game mode, if you aren't team leader). But you can't suggest star power. Imagine a situation, when you want to play Brawl Ball with random team and you get a Nita with Hyper Bear and Shelly with Band-Aid (and they both have both star powers for brawlers they're using right now), and you really want to make them use their other star powers, because they are better. So you can suggest them star powers.
