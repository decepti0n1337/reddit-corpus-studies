but want more XD people gets 2 star powers in one mega box took me 5 to get one
---
---
---
True
---
Maybe he meant borrowing stuff from tf2
---
God of Hyperdeath 8-bit
---
When you don‚Äôt know which one it is so you combine them.
---
isnt 8Bit just orisa on drugs?
---
My life has changed from the basics
---
Yeah I've played rush wars and honestly I prefer brawl stars 10 times over.
---
Love the rhyme and she really looks like an assassin to me do u have stats?
---
The iq of that man was lower than his comment
---
Frank is gonna STUNNN US! AHAGAGGAHAHAHHHH
---
I‚Äôm at 14k can I get Darryl?
---
Piper with her new sp inside thus guys turret on an open bounty map
---
That disappoints me though. I was 700 away from 4K when tick came out and I‚Äôm 600 away from 6K, and those are two mega boxes I won‚Äôt be able to get...
---
nice i have 9998
---
F
---
Teaming in big game
---
*stonks*
---
Mortis : I don't feel so good (√ó~√ó)
---
Honestly game devs and such deal with way to much shit from the public than they should
---
His trophy are 700
---
Shelly super...
---
I‚Äôm itching for a legendary brawler to get released. My current chance is 0.3216 and I‚Äôll be crushed (not really) if it‚Äôs ruined by a rare or something.
---
You for real?
---
Nope Shelly ult stuns you even mid dash so you still get clapped
---
Damn that's higher than the mythic chance
---
My phone broke, so I don't know what game is that
---
This was inevitable
---
am I the only one who don't like the new skin like it looks meh
---
Wow, thats what the art style reminded of who
---
Same
---
In order to play tick good you have to realize you cant play him like Mike  or barely.
---
At auto aim distance for a maxed piper (where you can't reasonably expect to dodge shots unless you basically just started dashing as they clicked) she does about 1300 damage I think, five of those is enough to kill Mortis
---
Just her looks. I can't wait to see her Star Skin &lt;3
---
Frank just tore him to pieces without stepping over the line. I think we all could learn from this.
---
Less low effort posts please
---
The -: am I a joke to you?
---
Less low effort posts please :)
---
???
---

---
Dude we only got a brief glimpse abd that was her during a match no less
---
No he wasn't at max range, he was close to her but she basically sprayed him.
---
Not funny, didn‚Äôt laugh
---
Me when I see teamers: I‚Äôm fucked                Me after kicking their asses
---
im literally shaking
---
And there‚Äôs a piper skin too. I whanna see that primo remodel tho
---
Hey coach Cory had the same idea!
---
Piper needs a nerf, and was always good imo
---
Nice play tho
---
They probably started working on the update before they went on break but yeah I agree
---
I've played the game, can't tell you how or else this comment would get removed.
---
Damn..that guy is toxic
---
i think its crows newest counter
---
Tick has never been garbage, your just playing him wrong.
---
Atakkkk
---
a day after the update: WHERE IS THE BRAWL TALK
---
Happy cake day
---
True that. I'll gladly play 30 gems for 8-Bit Classic
---
That's because Brawl is more f2p. In CR and CoC there are offers left and right.
---
I haven't played this damn game for such a long time. Beacuse fuck comp.
---
It's because... Poco is behind him... üòÇ
---
Poor supercell team tho
---
üò± soooo good!
---
Bootyfull
---
Yup
---
r/emojipolice im taking you to downtown
---
Time to zoom in
---
Where can i find a vid of this?
---
Rosie the Riveter pam seems like the way to go
---
8 bit is so indescribably cute I want to fucking shatter into a million pieces
---
-6 trophies?
---
You should be getting 4
---
You mean pam frank starpower rico and colt
---
bad meme
---
C
---
If he hits all of them. It looks like they‚Äôll have to be within half of max range to hit all the shots. Otherwise it‚Äôs only about 1600 or something, which is still pretty good.
---
K
---
When everyone sees el primo‚Äôs - oh wait
---
Screeching Solo at least forces Poco to give up his bread and butter: healing.
---
In most situations, there is a clear tradeoff when using it.
---
Wonder what starpowers will he have
---
I love it! Great work on the art!
---
When bo sees dynas remodel
---
How does this guy have over a hundred upvotes by begging the devs for a legendary?
---
I mean no 1st place
---
Congratulations dude you made it!
---
Only first place can give gems, others is trophies
---
r/holup
---
Well this was a common idea and it‚Äôs hard to find the first person who did it.
---
Yay
---
What's the need to crop out the credit?
---
I know looks cool
---
Well done Supercell!
---
It‚Äôs even worst if you try to push Mortis whit no starpower
---
Username doesn‚Äôt check out
---
Wouldnt it make more sense to drop the update on Friday like they usually do
---
Jfc, how many people do i fucking have to say this to?

#DARRYL AND LEON DON'T NEED VOICES

I think new Tara skin looks good

The problem is 8bit got skin right after he got release  &amp; Rosa , tick , Gene &amp; Bibi didn't got any skin

The only thing that I noticed is that your name is ‚Äúugly fish face‚Äù

Well then frick off and never come back!

You will get the brawler anyways and getting a mega box is better as you might get a new brawler, if not loads for points
---
And boss fight (if your into that) will be insane
---
Boi
---
I was playing for 2 weeks w/o getting any new Brawler, guess I was just saving up luck
---
Yeah, precisely. TF2 is such a masterpiece it has survived for so long even without any care from the devs, but, according to teamwork.tf, there's maybe 15 grand playing at a time, which is preeetty low compared to what has once been.
---
Sigh, I miss that game. Can't really enjoy it without any updates after 2K wonderful hours in it.

He? Why does Carl breaks Boss Fight?

Now it just needed tournament mode.

I call it with a correct terminology not what its supposed to be

Ok, do u have instagram or vk ?

Frankly I‚Äôve been watching so much family guy of late I just read everything like that

Isn't she also getting one
---
I‚Äôll miss him. He got me Leon.
---
Balls of fire is better in showdown last blast is better for seige
---
Congrats! Hope you play him well!
---
Yes
---
I bet the artist made two versions of 8 bit and he couldn't decide which one to use
---
Thanks man but he isn't really in the meta now is he?
---
It looks cute
---
I mind who you are
---
It‚Äôs done. I will post it tomorrow morning!
---
Piper with eyes creep me out :"3
---
Nice. As you get eveyone to 500 make sure to learn how to play them well so when you are ready to push beyond 500 it will be more enjoyable
---
Nope, only brawlers attained from boxes change your luck stat.
---
Yea I‚Äôm so glad that when frank said the new brawler is purple he just meant the trophy road icon
---
At least it was fun
---
if he can buff spawnables and turrets like IKE and bear 8bit you be extra broken
---
I don't think megaboxes could be around 1000, probably around 2,500
---
oh
---
The arcade came to kick butt and get rich.
---
The snipes were good i totally agree with that
---
Ahh Frank is a wise ~~old~~ man

I think that without a voice is better for Leon. It adds more to the mysteriousness of him. If we did get voice acting for him it'd literally be a 12 year old

i literally wanted to post the same thing lol
---
The numbers for rare, super rare, and all other non legendary brawlers won‚Äôt go to zero on there, the percentages are just split up behind the scenes. The legendary brawler chance is the only number that will change on there.
---
Now I have to try hard for the next trophy road brawler. (again)
---
Possibly even **their** ROBs too (I‚Äôm sorry don‚Äôt sue me I can‚Äôt help my self)
---
You really shouldn't be so stubborn bud. There's no point to veing so nitpicky except to argue. Why argue for no reason?
---
He must protecc
---
Some guy is gonna be like petition for supercell to switch d pad on 8 bit to fit like the gameboy
---
basically frank with range but slower
---
To be exact,she is an android
---
frank is a god
---
*suddenly turns around*
---
:0
---
Gg
---
this is really funny xD
---
I just passed 6k now after 1 hour of playing, I ended up getting mortis in the process
---
Pipbull
---
Imagine how much his skins will cost like
---
El primo is the only brawler who still looks the same from beta
---
I think that was implied in his joke
---
Carl and Pam are essential for that strategy. Replacing bull with 8-bit is tough because 8-bit will have a hard time running away from the boss missiles
---
Well he is ;w;
---
My personal guess is El Rudo will increase to 150 and El Rey up to 300. My advice would be too buy them before he gets remodeled.
---
Sorry but there were multiple opportunities for you to super to colt and take him out. Stop complaining
---
She released with Tara two months after Piper‚Äôs release
---
Speaking of King of the Hill. That would be an awesome game mode on Brawl!
---
him trying to convince me to open just convinced me to save up longer. Debate 100
---
I have el rudo, im also thinking to get el rey one but i also want the maple barley one qwp
---
Shit i confused tara and piper
---
I swear i knew that, i just got mixed up
---
Yeah most people would cuss him out.
---
so teaming is the "Smartest" play?
---
but i am not an enemy of the brawlers
---
There should be 2 skulls for solo showdown for all the teamers
---
Just look at his previous tweets as well...disgusting
---
Thank you,people don't stop to mistake him to the Famicom
---
How‚Äôs he gonna get it if he‚Äôs so slow though
---
I think we found a thiccer boi
---
Ah, nice to know that Gene is the only one keeping my 0.096% leggy chance hostage.
---
damn it‚Äôs true, will be some loaded Rico shit
---
In general.  The optimal way to play is team with as many people as possible and kill them if they get too close to you.  You don‚Äôt have to play that way but it makes no sense to complain about people making a smart play to push faster.
---
I don't blame you, Maple Barley is such a good skin. I have El Rudo and El Rey. I still remember being 5 gems away from getting Golden Ricochet, but i was too late and he became 150 Gem Golden Rico. "Sad f2p noise"
---
I 300% agree.
---
Gold rico is amazing, i sadly was 10 gems away when it was at 69
---
Lmaoü§£
---
rico you mean?
---
Outlaw colt, while also just a recolour, feels like there was at least a little effort put into it. Linebacker bull doesn‚Äôt have that at all, it‚Äôs just a lazy skin with no hard work or love put into it. If you like that skin then fine, all the power to ya, but otherwise it just sucks.
---
Piper and Tara have been waiting for more than 2 years, but some people only see Leon
---
Can we get a animation if where over 6000 trophys (it was sad when i diden't get to see me unlocking tick)
---
U suck
---
Keep up the good work dudeüëç

There *were* a few games where people didn't get what I was doing and thought I was throwing, which is understandable because it looks like half the game I'm just running in circles lol

Also, if the opponent had a Tick it fucked my day up

She always does, now take another nice look at her before she lose her gloves

Dude 30 months wait for Piper?? What about Tara how much wait??
---
Anyone knows about new star points and level ups??
---
How much now lvl 30??

That's good
---
are you blind? can't you see that the button scheme is literally the one of a game boy,and 8-bit's literal damn face is green,like the original game boy?
---
First of all ur same rank, didn't got me this post now i came to understand u mean to say same league
---
It IS a good game :)

He don‚Äôt really need to run away he can just shoot and hide in a wall and then put he‚Äôs station somewhere safe

One person did 3 of the comments, I dont think that counts

i was eagerly waiting for boxes in star shop but they're not coming this update. a little bit sad.

Soon is what we all know

Didn't know :o
---
haha
---
Yep me too
---
Nice
---
did you notice mortis is laughing right at the moment the other mortis dies?
---
You want to get the screws in middle, so it is best to use gene up close, but not too close for extra damage. When the bot is going after your safe, use your super yo pull it away. When at the enemy safe, try and pull away the brawler doing the most damage, or the lowest hp. If you want to use your super In middle, wait for the enemy to grab a screw and pull them in your safe zone. Sorry for covering only the basics, I don't have gene, I just know his play style.
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
Reporting for duty
---
As a Sombra main, I thought that too xd
---
rmbr that time there was ten ticks in a match, yea its gonna happen with 8 bit
---
Yea sure, but you can‚Äôt put *most* of the blame on the player that died least.
---
Dame bro üòÇ
---
That‚Äôs a lot of watermarks
---
Let me clarify some things. I am not 8, by your surprise.
---
And i am not hoping for a legendary, since i already got Spike.
---
And that i know about its past about Project Laser and Slug Fest.
---
They are working their butts off to please the community after being bombarded with people crying for Leon or Tara skins and voices, Band-Aid Nerfs and more. So please, take a breather, and calm down.
---
stonks
---
should we stop with this before it gets too awkward?
---
Oh yeah
---
I mean...i guess
---
I got spike, and got stupid lucky on a mega box, it sucks not having one, I know
---
thanks for the advice! now I know.
---
When you teammates feed opponents super constantly and you have to solo defend 3 tanks from coming then yes it is possible
---
Even if I had leon, my favourite brawler would still be tara..

Every legendary is equally good. But spike is just a kittle vit better than other two in competitive meta...also he can deal with band aid shellies easier than other legendaries.

Then its time to grind xD

I missed that!  That alone makes it a great update for me since I don‚Äôt care about skins

I want to compete in Europe. Thank you for the hint!

It‚Äôs actually not. It‚Äôs a clan of Russian people. It isn‚Äôt made for teaming, but for recognising other Russian gamers. Then, some may team. Some don‚Äôt. Both my cousins have this in their name but they never team
---
It was the power of God that allowed them to play with noobs.

I'm gonna spend all my starpoints on boxen and hopefully pull a legendary

Sad life leon! :(
---
Ur at 12 k with only 2 star powers ? Jeez i got my star powers pretty early , nita‚Äôs bear with me and shelly‚Äôs shell shock . Sadly both where by the time the new &lt; better &gt; ones came out but idm . Gl getting the rest of ur brawlers i got my first epic at 5k some thing maybe even less .
---
Is this supposed to be funny
---
Batting stance is not actually that good. 30% shield that‚Äôs only active for a short amount of time is kinda trash. Compare it to the huge mobility boost on her other star power, and you‚Äôll find that much more useful. Magnum special, however, is a huge buff to colt. It helps him deal better with snipers, his main weakness. I would never, in almost any situation, pick slick boots (a pathetic star power at best) over magnum special. It just has virtually no impact on the game. Slick boots needs a buff to be viable.
---
I feel like I have seen you in a Match before

Who cares? üòÇ he clearly just does it to take the piss, what is it with everyone and cringe shaming brawltubers lol. If you're over 18 and shit like that bothers you, you really need to grow the fuck up. If you're under 18 then well hopefully you've got time to grow up and get over "cringe".
---
Yes it can, cuz it‚Äôs not yours.
---
OMG I LOVE ADVENTURE TIME AND THIS IDEA
---
I agree that slick boots needs a buff lol.
---
But batting stance isnt bad. You say its active for only a short amount if time but that's inaccurate. It could be active however long I want it to be so long as u dont attack. The significance of batting stance is to allow u to close distance with minimal dmg. Homerun allows u to close distance but u take real damage.
---
It's a tradeoff but I dont see one being stronger than the other.
---
Although since I like spd period I like homerun more.
---
today or tommorow
---
Thats why i love supercell
---
Why does this crack me up?
---
Didn't knoe Bull is from Russia
---
How about a Light 8-Bit Classic. The difference between The Light and normal version is that he has a on and off switch for light and when he has a super the switch will be on and his screen will be backled

Crow actually has the same walk speed like Leon &amp; Mortis at 2.7 tiles per sec. üÖ±Ô∏èüÖ±Ô∏è with Home run is at 3 tiles per sec. Robo Retreat 3.2 and Meteor Rush &amp; Smoke Trails are at 3.4 tiles per sec.

They said that we are going to be able to buy boxes w/ SP

There is already a report button

They said they will change the star point amount that we will be receiving at the end of each season

Who cares about trophy remodel?

I would agree with teaming tho

Whene my team has 19% on the save and the enemy team 92% i will give up to

Just wanna make things a little bit clear for those who thinks its a small update and who thinks it has very little content
---
Or u mean a teamer 8_bit
---
Excuse me lol
---
It will come dont worry
---
the situation here in Brazil is not good either (
---
The famicom could be a reference as well.

So first we were shaking and now we are shattering? Lol

Yea I don‚Äôt buy them I wait for them to come into the shop that‚Äôs probably what it is

Stop bothering him. If it's ready, it will come out today. If not, tomorrow. They are doing their best too.  
---
I know you just want the update and so do I, but give them some more time.
---
They will figure out a way
---
With great brawler comes great nerfs
---
Would 8-bit‚Äôs super effect stack tho
---
Oh lol
---
Well at least the mine carts give us Carl
---
Community 8bits***
---
It can still be op lol
---
And you broke it as well
---
Maybe they started some of these things before theit vaccations. For example maybe Shark Leon could be planned for the summer update but delayed
---
bruh...
---
He made a lot of grear art, i think supercell inspired from him to do shark leon
---
Don't keep tagging devs and community mangaer in such or any posts the update is always within 48 hours of brawl talk have patience.
---
Trapper1000 I'm sorry for being rude, please forgive me.
---
REMODEL EL PRƒ∞MO !!!!
---
Not sure
---
I get that reference
---
They nerfed it pretty hard. . .they made it half of what it used to be üò≠
---
Ok i'll just quote dani: "we heard your feedbacks about not getting enough star points, so now we have more ranks, which means more star points"
---
I played the game. Don't like it. It doesn't put anything interesting on the table.

Yeah probably people like you
---
I'm near 6000 trophies in the Game
---
Weird flex, but ok
---
Hands down, the best moment of the update is when everybody plays as the new brawler.
---
I'm not supposed to give my opinion
---
I just grinded out 600 trophies today to hit 6k so I won‚Äôt miss that box. Didn‚Äôt get anything fancy from it. Still feel satisfied nonetheless.
---
8-Bit will have an hard time running away from furious Boss.
---
You remade my skin and I love it! Great Job!
---
I'm at insane 5 and gotta admit I'll do this if I think we have no chance such as both brawlers dying early on / wrong brawler hoarding all the cubes.
---
who is it that was throwing i might have played with them what brawler?
---
Y'all forgot darryl
---
 What? You've never played tuber simulator? You know it's fun right? I'm not supposed to give my opinion but you should give it a try, and then you can tell me if it's good or not. Not convinced yet? I'll cut you a deal! The game is completely free! And that's a great price!
---
Your gunna make alot of Mortis fan mad
---
And it sort of resembles the color scheme of the famicom
---
r/emojipolice
---
Probably
---
Nope. 8 bit's attack is linear and his movement is slow. This means that he cannot catch up. Crow will come in and out of of 8 bit's range and kepp him poisoned. Also 8 bit has big hitbox, which means it cannot dodge crow's attack. 
---
That's why I believe crow will be the perfect counter for 8-bit.
---
This map would be absolutely dominated by Pipers
---
8-Bit got probably released to announcer Rush Wars.
---
If it‚Äôs already been done let me know who and I‚Äôll give the credits... haven‚Äôt seen any yet thou...

All I'm hearing is that you're tired of shelly and would rather get destroyed by throwers ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I like balanced maps thank u very much, and if there is shelly in mid then shes ez prey for ranged brawlers
---
Waaaaaaaluigi
---
You forget something really important, Colt is faster and has a chance to dodge bullets, unlike 8-Bit, who is a large hitbox brawler with the slowest speed in the game, which means it's either kill or die.
---
Same. I have 5 boxes saved that I'm itching to open.
---
r/RushWars
---
On behalf of Rush Wars, I don't think that it's fair to compare a 2 days old game to a 5 years old game.
---
It would be cool to have a voting system for the top fan art idea, clip, etc. of the week/month. Would make the sub more engaging!
---
You literally have reddit for 12 days, look at my reddit age and then you can call. Me a dumbass. I was not a part of the subreddit, but then I downloaded reddit just to join pewds' subreddit. You LITERALLY have it for 11 days and you are being toxic out here and calling ppl dumbasses
---
You are right.But the hype just died out once everyone saw the gameplay.And you know it.

I think a stats bot that someone can put their brawl stars ID into and then have the bot retrieve the brawlers they‚Äôve unlocked and the amount of trophies they have (like the one on the discord) would be nice

That's all

I mean I implied it, he didn't say that word by word. Pretty sure there was a thread a while ago about the way frank addresses toxic comments.
---
I can agree to that.  It's better than what Clash Royale has done... or not done.
---
brawl stars was a hit beacuse it was something new but rush wars?
---
It is like clash of clans mixed together with clash royale

it may grow but not that much

Oh god now people are gonna beg for a Pam skin, pls help my brain is going to explode

Wait a second
---
He's unplugged
---
Band-aid
---
His attack doesn't seem to be a sharpshooter attack, I feel like he can be a support brawler because of his turret.

Oh god, people are gonna complain again

This is ... Great !

I wanna punch his neck

Better than Tick's release

I mean it's just an assumption. If they do keep this model then that would be dissapointing. But most likely their going to change it and add in those features.

There will always be a new update and new brawlers around the corner, so no need to save until you have maxed your account imo.

I thouth about it too!

It‚Äôs a crazy successful game. People tend to hate on it a lot, but the devs are crazy nice and tell the community everything. Welcome!
---
Because Frank was asked an honest question,  albeit crudely worded,  and he just deflected and changed the subject.  This shows psychology inferiority.
---
Hmmmmm. Good point. My guess is it will boost turrets and such
---
Satisfying

I like the sub as it is! Maybe having links to posts about the most recent updates in the side tab would be good?

I hope so, that red-waist-ribbon thingy was iconic

I dont see you trying to make a game with monthly updates so don't call him lazy for making a update in less then a month

Next week

Ninja leon and ninja crow are mega perfect fitting.

But you know, thats kinda cool. I mean, im even glad to see somebody stole my stuff. It makes me feel like im popular ;D

After watching more closely, you can also see the Darryl using autoaim as well lol. He started shooting at the bear many times when he could have just aimed and shot at Nita instead.
---
i did it too

i'm at 6.3k

I understand they've been cashing the checks they've gotten from their fanbase the whole time and this patch will be very underwhelming.

supercell needs to hire you asap

Because im a builder not a fucking game developer.  You would see me building high end housing monthly however. If i don't produce results i don't get paid.

I'm one of the people paying his bills,  so yeah,  i can call him lazy.

How do you get top hat Mortis

Ya, in my skull creek game, I was mortis and the rest where shelly. This happened multiple times. Not fun
---
Great design - I would definitely love to see this implemented in-game. Wonderful artwork - keep it up!

Bandaid nerf
---
Tomorrow. I‚Äôve known of the August 28 release date since the 12th
---
I think band aid got nerfed
---
I'm not 100% sure, but there may be a Leon offer coming soon with his shark skin. You're better off buying that IMO.

That‚Äôs a good point! Does coach Cory consistently post videos every day?
---
then he throws a fish then bites in to it and blood is drooling from his mouth
---
No shit sherlock
---
Yea I do belive that, the question is when, I simple ping system is extremely easy to implement, I dont understand why they cant put a simple system in rn and improve it later.
---
In my skull creek games there would only be like 1-3 Shelly's on the map.
---
Bull, primos...rosas...I had to camp alittle with my mortis lol. So many tanks. There was also spike but he does too much dmg.
---
Nice effort but why would we get confused in the first place though? It's not like people confuse their brawlers' hp with the safe.
---
They got me in the first half , not gonna lie
---
I thought it was today or tommorow
---
He aren't popular and that's why i give credits to him
---
i was walking right into class when i noticed i had a box i opened it and yeah she heard me
---
The world that‚Äôs waiting just for me, that I call, my, home.
---
You get him once you unlock mortis
---
Maybe his using his other starpower.Pams first star power doesnt affect her turret, but the second does.
---
‚ÄúCarlculating Optimus level‚Äù
---
Ok. I think we should end this long thread of comments now.
---
I don't think so, but none of the Brawl Tubers have uploaded anything yet today. I expect them to at least upload something since the Brael Talk dropped yesterday
---
Glad im not the only one who noticed
---
Right... last update came out around this hour, if I remember correctly
---
Damn, son, worked your ass off to get that before it vanished! Approved!
---
Noooooooo
---
712 Frank
---
Yep! Maybe even a little later
---
I was about to Comment that!
---
Thank you,I thought i was the only one who noticed it.
---
Balance changes coming soon!!!
---
Bravo frate (eu cu Piper)
---
Then he fish slapes
---
Yeah and mostly when updates are coming for sneak peaks with the Developer account
---
Well good thing I got the 6k mega box 4k ago
---
they did eye surgery on Piper
---
They also confirmed band aid nerf some minutes ago so if it's doesn't come out today it has to come out tomorrow
---
That makes much more sense, I was thinking famicon
---
i hope it gets many upvotes
---
Ur a fucking genius 1000iq. Ppl like u desearve to be in the subreddit getting upvotes
---
Thanks üòÑ
---
Yeah it will be out tomorrow for certain, I'm just hoping it will come today
---
Wait something beautiful happened

Mortis buff maybe ?
---
What‚Äôs RO? Cuz if its a country with like no people yeah then its not special
---
Will the damage boost from the turrets stack
---
That was a joke. But i understand you because it's a horrible joke
---
All of them are great but its just your opinion
---
We got a skin and darryl is mute and has a skin
---
A
---
I really dislike how many emojis you used in the title
---
Hell yeah!!
---
Look ping is already quite famous thanks to Apex so they must know about it too, and it's been requested by the community many times,and they're listening to feedback a lot so that's a good sign. but it'll still take an in game UI overhaul, so it might come in the next big update.

This feels like ‚ÄòLIKE IF YOU WANT OLD BO SKIN, COMMENT IF YOU WANT NEW BO SKIN‚Äô to me

# 10/10 would smash upvote again
---
Spike, spike is everywhere
---
they didn't confirm nerfing it though, they might just deleted it instead which they should do
---
Try to push only solo showdown so u don't have to deal with randoms it worked for me and I'm almost at 9000
---
Exactly even I'm stoked abt 8 bit
---
Ok, kind from you! :) Sorry if I was annoying
---
When her bandaid is activated she receives 700 health every two seconds three times
---
do we need them to confirm this one though
---
I suggest that every month one of favorite community post to be somehow implemented in the game, like a cool sistem that a reddit user suggested and the community liked to be added in to the game.
---
üòé

Which one do you play most or best I think you should buy his/her skin

Take a shot everytime he says "thanks" or "thank you"

Completely agree, I love bounty, it‚Äôs my favourite mode, and if we hardly see it any more I‚Äôm going to be very sad :(
---
My name is 3bbaDi_73. What's yours?
---
The icon is awful I hope they change it
---
I'm very sure that it will come tommorrow because Skull Creek map will be removed from the game. So, this is the last day when you'll play with that map, it will be removed.
---
It's basically the same skin with 3 different colors thougj

---
Now that what i call an epic crossover
---
what is the cost of the normal brawl box
---
I need to find one first
---
Actually more like 8MO
---
mega boxes only cost 1500
---
probably tomorrow. it's 8pm in helsinki so if it doesn't come out within an hour then it's definitely tomorrow.
---
Why are half the Arabic countries banned from the giveaway
---
Ha sure she will lmao
---
Omg what? Can we now with star points buy brawl boxes??
---
they refresh all events with a new update
---
Why you removed your name? Its not like we‚Äôre gonna bully you
---
thank you for posting this. She literally looks like bull.
---
I swear, that happened to me on my mini account when tick was released. I was at 3973 trophies and when it was showdown, aw few seconds later "Maintenance break in 5 minutes" I got 2nd place. Got 8 trophies and I depressingly closed the game. I was happy and sad at the same time.
---
You can also turn your 15 000 star points into 10 mega boxes (100 normal boxes) if you like

She went from a scary bitch to a girl who wants to be a bad girl.
---
Her new icon sucks
---
Most likely tomorrow sadly we
---
yes
---
This is not a good change
---
I love this vid√©o its so so so so funnyyyyyyy
---
As a siege/gem grab main I don't like this change why don't Supercell just make another slot for brawl ball...
---
For those who don't know his second star power will be when 8bit dies he respawns once per match
---
the best change
---
Maybe i will finally be able to get Mortis Crow or Leon üò≠
---
Sadness
---
Change the eyebrows
---
Yes I hope for some Star powers because i miss 11
---
Her pupil also needs to be wider.
---
Idk dude, is too ugly xd
---
I got coins and power points
---
Yeah but carl requires skill to pull off those rapid shots
---
Jeez &lt;3 Anyways thank youuuu
---
And eyebrows
---
tara and piper's skins are 500 star points, not 5000.
---
you can now buy boxes for star points;
---
big box for 500 and mega box for 1500
---
It's an invisible lollipop( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Can you comment all of the balance changes please? Thank you!
---
She looks like she came out of the mii editor
---
pipers icon is unsettling

mb - it autocorrected "especially" :)

This looks interesting... imagine all those Bulls and Darryls "supering" through water here

#FISH SLAP! üêü
---
teammate of mortis : ah shit here we go again
---
How did you get her new icon
---
Actually you have a good point. But it's still arguable, since what Frank is making money on the game's, and by extension, his popularity, so as you can see by the existence of this very topic is that he gets more success with a good "counseling" reply than trying to be more assertive about content delivery.
---
No 8 bit is 30 and leon is 80
---
Yeah, i totally agree with you
---
Really?
---
Haha cute
---
Yeah, i agree
---
Nice repost

It's probably not gonna be today
---
I mean mabye?
---
Lmao why
---
darryl too lol
---
Absolutely not. All of the beta models were made using old software, the reason everyone likes the old one more is because of how long it‚Äôs been in the game. We‚Äôll get used to this new one soon.
---
I see you're a fellow Brazilian (or Portuguese maybe, I'm Portuguese)
---
Awful
---
Its ROMANIA and it has a lot of people!
---
We have great players!
---
I didn‚Äôt see frank‚Äôs please send link
---
Its a glitch... dude really u thinked that?
---
The power is in your hands use it wisely
---
Nope, I prefer heist and bounty. At least we still have gem grab!
---
it's useful if you do it for a match or two just to upgrade your brawlers' ranks, but obviuosly it's boring
---
Some girls are prettier in different angle, but admit it that‚Äôs not the face she gave you while you trying to get closer to her by moving between cactus
---
Lol ni band aid will still be a good star power it just isnt s tier anymore
---
Haha my mini is currently at 5.6K. Fuck
---
Agreed. Bo icon is looking old already.
---
How?
---
Sorry dude
---
It will be op in showdown but idk how it would work if 8bit was the last guy to die coz that would be confusing
---
Take my upvote
---
Woah
---
He musta inserted Bibi‚Äôs eyebrows onto the icon
---
We will miss her anyways
---
The second is scary ! The first is not scary ! So ..... put the first one i guess .
---
For those who are wondering the video comes from a french BS youtuber called Axael TV
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I SPEAK FOR THE SHELLY MAINS /s
---
How do you know?
---
I think an expansion on the flairs would be a good move for the subreddit.
---
Yup. I don‚Äôt do skins, so might as well just keep them and see what happens
---
And yh the community like the old models so do I
---
How can you know this infos guys?
---
I‚Äôm liking the color
---
I‚Äôll miss that model too, it‚Äôs classic. But I‚Äôm more excited for the future, and all of the cool skins this new model of Piper can get!
---
Tara got a Shelly skin
---

---
Bet
---
That icon is horrifying
---
Omg somebody give this man an award
---
Where did you get this information?
---
Both her starpowers will get buffed aswell
---
No. Lol
---
Wait till this gets used for a thumbnail or gets posted on Instagram.
---
Thought so. Good try!
---
nita: nita
---
In Europe (Where Supercell's headquarter is) its 9 PM so the update will be in 12 hours time (tomorrow for european)üëç
---
But rosa get buffed and darryl nerfed, why
---
Well to be fair, when you are so far away, you really can't protect them anyway
---
Today I actually got Leon I'm super happy...ok whatever yeah it's sad that Shark Leon loses the lollipop but the rest looks pretty dope, right?
---
Me too, I'd rather have heist or bounty be permanent than brawl ball.
---
Gene mains second this
---
BeBe
---
Cuz after the sneak peeks the update gets released
---
Dude, didn't you noticed that gene, rosa, carl released on friday?
---
W-what?!
---
I FULLY agree that Tara needs a small buff in her reload speed at least.
---
But, no, according to the Patch Notes, Tara is only getting buffs to her 2 star powers.
---
She looks so much younger
---
stop being toxic. they just asking a question which the sub is meant for.
---
oh,thanks man,i missed this
---
You‚Äôre right, bit Shelly can almost play all modes plus there is not much of a skill require for bandaid but snappying sniper those require a skill and you could kill piper with a bandaid shelly
---
Make oven/stove 8-BIT
---
Thank you!
---
Oh he's portuguese? I didn't know about that lol
---
Thanks!
---
Yea why does she have black eyebrows in the icon but blonde ones in game?
---
"hahahahaHAHAHA"
---
Yes. Thousand Lakes gets removed.
---
where is button for suicide 
---
i dont like band-air nerf and buff leon star power idk
---
Reaching 500 before was a good sign of skill and was sort of an accomplishment. Now they made it way easier to reach 500, and actually a 50% win rate would bring you up to 700 trophies. However, you constantly lose them every season, so essentially makes it less valuable, while taking it away every season. Overall, killing motivation and achievement of the feat.
---
&amp;also they came back from a vacation so the update (if took too long) will be on fri
---
your the only one who think that...
---
Do you remember that brawlers used to come out after the update? The updates are usually Tuesday or Wednesday and the brawlers that aren‚Äôt trophy road would get released on Friday. You are right, but not for the trophy road
---
no
---
I dont l8ke the new icon
---
The player can choose whoever he wants. Stop crying
---
I‚Äôm so mad they keep slaughtering my boy
---
Youtubers get all the information in the update and supercell probably tells them what they are allowed to say. Coach Corey leaked a ton of the new update. Including several balance changes (mainly starpowers but also some base brawler changes), a different mode rotation, both starpowers for the new brawler, the rank system and much more.
---
I like the icon NGL
---
Wtf you actually gender-swapped Colt????
---
Supercell: how many budget do we have after announced the August update? None, fine just shave that bitch‚Äôs fur and get rid of those teeth and call it a new skin,that should teach those suckers to shut up about new skins for a while .....
---
And which map replaces it? Please for the love of God don't say island invasion
---
8 bit isnt even in the game yet and i already see many skin ideas
---
Thx!
---
did someone say that it was coming today or tomorrow. surely theres a chance of it coming later like on friday
---
So...what's the Day today? Tell me the name
---
Usually update is 1-2 days after brawl talk
---
AGREE!!!
---
Cool
---
You loose two matches, one without piper. I think YOU are the problem.
---
Might be  better if she has a Meatball gun to match her current projectile style.
---
And her turret would be the boiling pasta as before.
---
Thanks bro üòâ
---
It‚Äôs Tuesday, duh. Also did you even read what I said?
---
Let's just say he tried his best.
---
now band-aid is useless will preffer to use shell shock when i max shelly
---
Cursed
---
If you mean no band aid nerf plz it‚Äôs already confirmed that bandaid heals 2k health instead of up to full
---
Can this be made in real life?
---
The star skins cost 500 each not 5k
---
Damn that fucking sucks. 
---
I want bounty to be permanent instead.
---
Band-aid needed a nerf leon's second star power got buffed from 600 hps to 800 hps
---
Too cheap
---
And her old icon
---
Shut up and make me a sandwich.
---
I agree it‚Äôs terrifying
---
Bot 4 &gt; Bot 1
---
Looks pretty cool but I would get rid of those brown bricks
---
In fact, I did read the other notes about the update. And I do agree that the new ranks will help to gain Star Points. The main argument still stand. Do you have any idea how hard it is to get to rank 20, now 35? 0.01% would even reach there for all the brawlers. Even if they do, those are the exact players who ALREADY have their brawlers maxed so they have nothing to gain from this new box system, therefore should be left out of the discussion. According to official Supercell data. 99% doesn't have ALL their brawlers even to rank 20 yet so those numbers you threw up there are pretty much irrelevant to the targets of the discussion rn: F2P players who want to become maxed.
---
1.500
---
I wonder if it can work in solo showdown? Also people said Shelly's bandaid was OP because it was like she had a second life, so they give another brawler a literal 2nd life lol.
---
nah,u just mean the band aid in her default skin :) but good to know thx
---
The new piper icon looks like if she was a child
---
Lol the best losing animation
---
I think an area where we call out and link developer responses in recent threads would be nice to keep tabs on their interactivity with the community.
---
Thanks for the giveaway!
---
No it doesnt, the old one is MUCH less polished
---
He spittin' straight faccs
---
Noice
---
You can notice that Eyebrow is on hair
---
Canada is in america...
---
R.I.P.
---
Piper looks like Satan.
---
It was nerfed already
---
Its quite fun but I honestly expected something else after cr and bs
---
I was hoping for 500-1000 a mega box, but was expecting 2500 for a mega box, I am pleased, this is fair enough.
---
Thank you for this.
---
Yeah, I prefer old piper
---
Keep in mind he only respawns once, not every 20 seconds
---
Best idea ever
---
I just got to 10 k and i got only 1 character from all the 6 megaboxes, that was first megabox.
---
And ....
---
That......
---
Was...............
---
carl :'(
---
At least she finally got the skin and remodel she's been waiting for after 2 long years
---
I support the idea!
---
Excuse me, WTF
---
Well, Im such a bot, 500 is an achievement and i can't get anyone to 500 
---
Plus, 8 Bit is SLOWER than BRUCE 
---
which makes DODGING way hard
---
Sorry, *residents of the United States of America*
---
Glitches category
---
Finally, a shelly nerf
---
Robox
---
No one should have enough fire power to fight back teamers 
---
Because in reality you are saying that she had enough fire power to kill 2-3 person alone. And this is insane.
---
Nerf: MUAHAHAHAHA
---
Yay! Butterfly pin!

---
I CAN‚ÄôT WAIT THIS UPDATE IS SOOO GOOOOOODDDDD

Her face needs a remodel
---
It‚Äôs your fault if you mined at night (I‚Äôm so sorry)
---
r/cursedbrawlstars
---

---
icon sucks
---
not gaming at all, this is most likely a scummy way to farm karma, post this somewhere else because this doesnt belong here.
---
Where's your luck ? There is no luck, only skill
---
I see
---
And?
---
it's not the remodel, it's the icon
---
I guess the picture is even worse with teeth!!
---
Uhadi bletovec, tebe tut ne mesto, a to eshe zatimishsya s kem to
---
Literally manlier than Bull
---
Why they did that and also skull creek i hate when they remove og maps
---
I am signing in!
---
UPVOTE!!!
---
Thank you for such a thoughtful reply, similar content to the one below but completely different tone. I propose that they make it so that the only paying aspects of the game are brawler pulls and skins/cosmetics (they can add emotes, map theme, music, taunts, etc.) I understand that this is very unlikely given that the people we are talking about here is Supercell who have had great success with this Pay2Max model like in CR or CoC but BS is not either of those things. It is a completely different genre, cross of MOBA and FPS, and therefore a different approach is needed. The approach I proposed is the most common one in BOTH genre, ex. League of Legends with character pulls and Fornite with exclusively cosmetics.
---
Yeah but know she looks even more annoying.
---
What the F is that icon?
---
Thank you. You can use usa for short
---
Do you know if you choose or if it‚Äôs just the first death?
---
F for you, u got my respects
---
We did it boys.....
---
Seismic activity is no more!
---
Yes,thats the point.
---
Good luck.
---
Why did they change her picture from blond eyebrows to black eyebrows when she has blond eyebrows in the remodel?
---
I agree with the nerf band-aid brigade but stupid shit like complaining about brawl talk or buff crow is childish and makes everyone look like selfish babies
---
It's useless in 3vs3 since you'll die before it can have any impact most of the time and you also lose all of your cubes in showdown after that it's like you don't have a star power
---
Rockabilly is so good
---
Wow
---
yep
---
I agree.Remember when Bo got remodeled after months of people begging for his remodel and when its released all r/Brawlstars is beeing ungreatful and whining.
---
You sound like Indian fact genius
---
soon will be her
---
I'm pretty sure that info will make things just worse
---
What's wrong with people they hate every new model when i like every model and this is one pretty beautiful model
---
Just to get views üòÖüòâ

True but Oh well time to use other Shotgunners,Atleast Darryl is getting a rework his new attack pattern can really make a difference
---
So you can't escape nita's bear if she spawns him on top of you?? Good thing those laser do a ton of damage.
---
Hola :)
---
No one is going to take your word for it without good evidence.
---
Good luck on it ! Have you done South America or Antarctica ?
---
Hooh boi i guess i gotta save up my gems fir the shark skin
---
GUYS! I know Band-Aid needed a nerf but in order to keep Shelly somewhat viable in the meta, they should have buffed something else about her character (damage at max range or anything) Also no need for downvoting this is just my opinion and everyone is entitled to their own opinion!
---
This inspires me too learn blender and unity, more than anything
---
I have 0.0576, got all except Leon and Spike.
---
FML.
---
When i first saw it i was like ‚Äúwhere is her teeth?‚Äù
---
I think leon just needs reworked with the nerfs placed on him he can't be played the way he was intended in the current meta especially with everyone getting these healing starpowers Leon really can't sneak up and assassinate many if any now
---
Thank you spike sock
---
Please no 24 hour brawl ball
---
My favourites are heist, siege and bounty. I can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre limping in ALL 3!!!
---
Thanks ! üòä
---
Now this is really shaking
---
Now tre life have sense
---
You're right, I'm happy for you since I can tell by your flair that Darryl is your fav. Hope you enjoy playing him more now!
---
Now the life have sense
---
PERFECT

I‚Äôm saving for the new and inevitable Legendary that should be dropping in October. I have enough so far
---
No, i started making South America and idk why stopped. I have Northern America and Australia on my profile ;)

I just got the box today!
---
This is great. Id also like to see a Sesame Street cash register skin. 
---
https://youtu.be/5Nw_8JD6JY0
---
On paper it seems like a really big nerf but in reality all I really needed was for it to save my life so I could get 1 last super off/survive 1 more dynamike bomb
---
Thx! A yeah, go for it ! It's so much fun to do !üòâ
---
Because she‚Äôs got to put that mouth to good use
---
The 50% win rate is at 800 trophies so they average played will get to rank 26.  The reason it‚Äôs lower now is because the trophy balance changes are so recent inflation has not finished yet meaning trophies will rise and f2p players can keep increasing their amount. Considering the average is not rank 26 a better than average player can easily get to 30+ meaning they can get the majority of these free star points
---
I totally agree with u

That is nice!

But I do want to recreate it once it becomes popular
---
Hmmm idk... maybe you found the one exception, but he'd need to be redone as well
---
What yt video tho???
---
I don't know how to play UNO buddy that sh*t won't work on me.
---
Chill dude... Its nice.. I can see the effort... It would be unplayable tho... And with my statement i didnt wanted to insult you in any way, its just bothering me that every single goddamn map idea here is "good".... Doesnt matter if you would get pinched, teamed on or other... No, every map is a fucking gift from god
---
Its strange but its true
---
Perfectly balanced as all things should be
---
I got Tick to 300 the day he came out,Nothing special He wasn't a bad brawler to begin with anyway
---
Solid
---
 Your wrong
---
I had spike with 0,06
---
That's awesome
---
8bit is going to dethrone pam and spike as both the cutest and thiccest brawler.
---
;)
---
i get bored with leon because he is too super-reliant, but its fun to annoy with chip damage with crows poison. idk about spike because i dont have him yet but he seems the most fun to play with

permanent brawl ball. finally i can push trophies everyday
---
Nah iOS haha
---
I'll give it a 10k/10k Voxels
---
Wow!!!Roman
---
It was sarcastic
---
Tomorrow update guys
---
Brawl ball... permanent?
---
This is a good day.
---
No problem mate üëçüèº
---
sry everyone my bad. 
---
but still i think below 10k players won't get anything for season reset reward...
---
i never found band-aid to be the problem with shellys in SD, it was her super that made her strong in SD
---
I'm the jerk. Yeah.
---
All I said "I disagree with your opinion"
---
You: make a unfunny joke, that I didn't even recognize as a joke, but as an offense.
---
You again: Makes a *useless*, yeah, (*useless* because it really was) giant text to talk about how *somehow* I'm acting like a toddler. 
---
And if by that answer I made you, you concluded that, the world needs less people like me, that I'm a toddler and a jerk. You sure are dramatic, the only child here.
---
And when did I somehow connected the fact that english isn't my language to the way I'm acting. That was random of yours.
---
To end, saying that I shouldn't answer because I would look like a toddler don't stop me from nothing. You're the only who looks like one here.
---
piper‚Äôs remodel icon, sir
---
:)
---
When is the update cumin out btw?
---
God I fucking hate Brawl ball , randoms in that are on a whole other level of stupid. now I‚Äôm forced to play it everyday for the star token.
---
Yeah would add it just for fun too i guess :)
---
That'd be the best way to nerf it imo
---
Its kinda weird but.... its also nice ! :D
---
You meant Bounty.
---
Her voice though. There's no way she's a kid.
---
Cause gene punched out them
---
They should‚Äôve given her a different super, some form of snare or net that allows her to get closer to enemies.
---
Her flaw as a character is the fact that her attack and super both require her to get close up like a tank despite lacking the health or movement speed of someone like Primo.
---
Ikr like they gotta do another one from scratch
---
*700
---
Little features : brawl ball permanent. 
---
It's a revolution, not a little features lmao.
---
Thanks for this list
---
Shelly is still super good tho (too good imo). She can win fights against people with 3 power cubes more than her just cuz of her brawl power.
---
Okay. I'm not even going to bother with your overdramatic retaliation.
---
But for real, his left arm looks like a statue arm. There is my reasoning. Lets end this interaction like normal humans then.
---
Sniff sniff
---
ok
---
So many people haven't even played it but are jumping on the bandwagon and talking shit
---
What meme
---
*Wow such empty*
---
Well played, OP.
---
i have a leg to but i had it when i was born
---
Wait overgrown oasis removed? But this is a new map
---
No problem man
---
omg, me too, it's a sad thing
---
Umm Tara‚Äôs and Piper‚Äôs star skins will cost 500, not 5000
---
Going to reply to everyone who disagrees: imagine if every brawlers had the same rarity, would they still be loved? No they wouldn‚Äôt. A lot of brawlers got unique mechanics and if a brawler like Gene was legendary he would get much more love. Just because they‚Äôre rare doesn‚Äôt mean that they‚Äôre so fun, they‚Äôre biased by their rarity. Every brawlers got unique mechanics, crow‚Äôs for example isn‚Äôt that original compared to a gene. I rather have a good mortis than a spike, I have spike and he‚Äôs boring to play even at high trophies.
---
Welp, feel free to downvote my post, I just gave my opinion after all.
---
Thousands lakes can go to hell. Terrible map design. But Skull creek and eye of the storm on the other hand are two my favorite maps.
---
Nani tf
---
Ye ngl he‚Äôs a little above average at best

No, it‚Äôs a 1 tile reduction. It‚Äôll still be able to reach far, but 1 tile less. Shelly‚Äôs band aid got cut in half.

The last time being in rotation :'(
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs just annoying to see people praise brawl ball and hating on siege when they have some of the same bad things.
---
Its complitly diferent i like it to much!!!
---
Disagree.  New Piper looks way cleaner and way better.  I really don't care that she's not squinty-eyed anymore or lost her gloves.  Her portrait is where they kinda fucked up a bit.
---
Its still in beta tho, no point in making predictions
---
Heist. Yes. of course, How was I so blind? heist is the star one and bounty consists in killing the enemy bounty that has ~40k hp
---
Looks great!! Glad it came out the way you wanted :)
---
Totally
---
I think the problem with a lot of brawlers like Leon is the fact that one super is enough to kill people, when that should rarely ever be true, the game has gotten faster and faster over the course of its development and I think they need to slow it down a bit. 
---
Instead of just buffing his stats rework his super so it has a shorter duration but charges faster so he‚Äôll have to turn invisible again and come back later to finish people off, something similar should be down with most brawlers in this game because a lot of them just do way too much damage to fast, some brawlers like Tara used to be unique because they were able to do that back when the game was slower, but now everything is fast and it is hard to see that anymore.
---
It‚Äôs always an endless cycle of not liking they remodel then eventually you get used to it
---
She has her top teeth like in the icon we have now. You'll see it tommorrow
---
They‚Äôll get used to in after the first game but it does look nice though
---
D a r r y l
---
The more i look at it the weirder it gets. At first glance it looked amazing, then it started to look weird. No offense, I might just be crazy
---
I like both here remodel and her icon. Wait this is Piper‚Äôs icon? Dear god forgive me for everything I‚Äôve typed

Look at the black hole that is her mouth...

Yeah and it‚Äôs def without an immunity shield for the first few seconds.

Also you probably won‚Äôt be able to attack right away after you resplendent, there‚Äôs likely some kind of animation that then allows your enemy to get a shot off before you do

You're the one being dramatic here though, you probably thought he was mocking you but I can assure you he didnt, and honestly you are kind of acting childish here because youre making such a big deal over a comment, writing paragraphs and being passive agressive, just fucking relax the dude didn't even say anything mean to you at first before you started bashing on him all of a sudden.

I agree. Now frank has the worst 2nd star power.

I don't think that could work since people heal and also if Leon can't finish someone off during an assassination he's almost guaranteed to be dead because he reloads so slow

I don't understand

I was just trying to help

lmfao he sounds exactly like poco tooüòÇüòÇ
---
They have the same animation
---
I hated eye of the storm. It looked really cool, but I always got cornered between 2 or 3 people. If you spawned in top mid or bottom mid you were basically dead because there were 2 people next to you and there was no way to go other than towards one of them.
---
Making my way through the the hood sippin this yak you about to get with the Mac
---
stolen
---
Yeah i thought the same when looking at the icon, like something is wrong and i just couldn't put everything in place lol
---
Shelly's icon was changed in the December update tho
---
Stop making fan arts and try getting hired by supercell ! 
---
Seriously, this look WAAAAAAY better but the changes are so light and minor ! 
---
Great work !
---
Max rank will be 35 at 1200 though
---
cuz they‚Äôre shit
---
its bad, but yeah it was pretty ambiguous
---
hahahaha it‚Äôs the sex number wow so funny and original omg rofl
---
This is really only an issue in showdown to which kind of sucks cause it‚Äôs my favorite one to play
---
Liferally what if neogeo with maetal slug started walking.
---
A top play every week would be awesome. Or some tip sharing from pro players

---
Its just you.
---
Actually, I fond that icon (and the new Piper overall) freakin‚Äô adorable
---
Why would you steal art?
---
Did they remove thousand lakes?!? I wait for that map every season
---
to keep the game fresh by adding new ones in the rotation
---
Accept leon
---
Spike socket is back
---
WE DID IT BOYS,SHAKING IS NO MORE
---
Bad word
---
No, I don't I will
---
Mortis mains are happy rn

hahahaha it‚Äôs the sex number omg so funny and original

And the icon near the trophies is from 2000 trophies

im shaking

Yeah :-)
---
This man will be invincible in gem grab

Also her ear piercing is missing

Nope I don't think that will happen,but if it happens what are you going to do to kill this 8bit he has 6k health and a ton of damage
---
Spike‚Äôs calling the police
---
‚ÄúWho is a good boy? Yes, you are!‚Äù

That animation shouldn‚Äôt work with p2w players

She looks younger
---
No.

The bad thing is her icon
---
She got no teeth fam
---
mm. Lol, i had it Two days ago somehow haha
---
Oh ok
---
Idk I think she should have teeth, she looks toothless
---
He was it of tokens lol
---
Tomorrow
---
I hate him
---
Have you reported said posts?
---
Dude just enjoy your last precious moments with band-aid Shelly and older Piper and grind them trophies
---
R34: Want this Back!
---
I think the teeth are a bit too close to the tongue or a bit too big. I saw other people try to draw teeth for piper's icon and they did like just the white line of the teeth and it looked normal. I'm not good at art but i thought i'd give my opinion
---
How about band-aid.Band aid was the most broken thing in SD that's the reason that it got netted.The same thing is with bit,but it's a 2.0 version of band aid
---
I personally like the no teeth mouth, but the other changes are actually good
---
She dyed her eye brows black
---
This dude tweaked piper‚Äôs portrait and I think it looks waaaaaay better !

This happened to me yesterday. I was getting 500 with Bo. After much struggle I got it
---
I agree, I think it has to do with her bust size being reduced. But new Piper looks a little more organized in terms of color. Happy cake day btw.
---
Darryl getting a nerf makes no sense
---
Brawl Stars for the win!
---
The nose and the eyebrows...
---
An unnecessary touch, make the temp the amount of kills you've gotten. Or something a long those lines.
---
Maybe like rank?

*T H E E T*

I gues it is supposed to look more like a sniper than a umbrella.

I'm going to miss her happy expression with the gloves

Megaleodon

Bruh moment

I got spike with chance 0.01004

Yeah. Duo showdown is my favourite gamemode to push on and i think it's quite big of a problem. All the replays of people beating others with way more powercubes just because of that respawn invincibility really proves that everything isn't ok with it
---
I got used to the no teeth thing, it's the eyebrows that throw me off.
---
This place exists between dream and reality, mind and matter.

I think that pipers rework looks weird in the lobby, she looks depressed. Could you als fotoshop that one?

Delete losing trophies? Haven‚Äôt they done enough of that
---
Totally applies to me
---
New piper is totally ugly af we need the old one back ASAP
---
But you don't have band aid...
---
Actually just noticed that, but it was done in a hurry, (Congrats Supercell) which is about 20 days. They did 92 changes in 20 days. Sure doesn‚Äôt sound like much on paper, but everyone will be happy with the results when they will acknowledge supercell‚Äôs hard work.
---
You lose all your cubes (it does nothing against people with 5 or more) and it only works once band aid worked every 20 seconds
---
When‚Äôs the update due?
---
You probably made a 8 year old kid bust a fat one..
---
Tako je.
---
Band-Aid was nerfed because it was op everywhere not just Showdown
---
me too but the new expression honestly fits her  voiced lines
---
Same, I was overexcited this morning but then I checked my updates I was surprised there was none, although I knew in the back of my mind those feelings were irrational
---
I hate the eyebrows and the pupils
---
Nick peice of work

At least it gives the Tara mains a chance to push

Stop

ikr im happy i got him to rank 20 as early as possible if i got him to be stuck on rank 16 alongsode the others im pushing id be in big pain (altho i might need to get him to 25 or smth but whatever honestly)

Ngl for a second I thought she was

She Is a grandma with lot's of makeup that Is why she doesn't have teeth

I saw a version of her with teeth, I'm not sure if it was fan made or you know some actual footage in the post build

If you played well, you still could ve won easily just by having frank on your team :)

That what somebody says during a heated gamer moment.

No. Bad word is bad. Please remove
---
Uhhh how is that sarcaism?
---
Here have a coat
---
I just want thousand lakes
---
But we can all agree that her icon looks.........
---
And they did all of that after their vacation. And don‚Äôt forget the new ways to earn star points, the new brawler, maps, and other few tweaks.
---
There is literally NOTHING to complain about in this update, but every toxic kid of this sub is crying because of a stupid brawler icon.
---
Respect to all the dev team to be sooo patient, my mind would have explode for a loooong time.
---
Probs autocorrect f-ing them over
---
I THINK they will, and IMO that would be so overpowered.
---
let's forget about that...
---
It would be even cooler if his face could slowly be spinning
---
yeah but its still kinda bs (pun intended) since by personal experience luck factor takes like 50% of the thing (the other 50 being skill) and it's honestly a gamble
---
Put Tara mains up there too my man
---
Me at 10k trophies: Amateurs
---
plz make this map come into play
---
She looks bitchy and I Llke it! Fits her voice and personality
---
As a darryl main that's currently in 807 the only thing I can say is that he'll have some problems with bull and el primo but it shouldn't be too bad also he can be used in showdown since he is capable of winning against band-aid 2.0 shelly
---
Hey guy, what about boxes for starpoint? WHEN?WHEN? WHEN?
---
This is amazing I hope it‚Äôs gets into the game it is much better
---
Damn right you are!
---
I really hope I can get the Darryl skin from last year
---
Maybe someday if more people say stuff about it. Because one time I had 21 power cubes and I lost due to someone being immune.
---
Why is the old one so creepy??
---
I saw her with teeth as well , but I‚Äôm more used to cartoons since most of my animations are cartoons (yes I do animations). I actually tried doing a remodel of Piper myself. Not so proud of it for which I didn‚Äôt post.
---
I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs probably a mechanism for escape rather than combat
---
start removing low effort memes, they really clog up the sub, this is the only sub I don't browse for a game that I play a lot, just because of the crappy memes
---
Seeing that all her teeth are all gone terrifies me
---
Oh yes
---
i mean yeah thats kinda right
---
Pirate gang will still support you tik
---
First, it will not come for Britain but in the whole world at the same time.
---
Second, nobody here knows when it will come.

lol, but I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs an NES. The gun is a pretty big giveaway.

God I hate Pipers new Icon, also they way she stares into your soul as the remodel, yuck.

You shouldn't get trophies if you can't handle higher level players

Rico after Pipper's remodel
---
Big game though... it won't work right? (nervous laughter)
---
I have better idea:
---
Don't change old icon
---
People don't usually notice post like these. They usually just upvote post with cool art saying it's a petition or making a meme about it. That's why many cool ideas die in new
---
I'm not sure...üò≠
---
Don't forget mortis
---
Noooooo
---
I like this icon too, but I have to admit she seems toothless
---
I feel like a Beta Test Realm could work for Brawl stars. It‚Äôd help with new brawler balances and missing glitches

---
Yeah, Thousand Lakes is my favorite map
---
i mean you say its easy but difficulty can vary through people and lemme tell ya 1 people every 5 showdowns can actually do it properly
---
They are fun to play just because they are rare. Every brawler has different mechanics and just very few have similar ones
---
Wow, this is great!
---
Thanks ü§©
---
It is nerfed to 0.4
---
It‚Äôs probably just me but I prefer piper‚Äôs old model and icon. Maybe it‚Äôs just because I‚Äôve grown used to it. New piper will probably grow on me slowly
---
I‚Äôm waiting for the fam update!
---
Yes pls
---
I havent been on this long enough to know what you post all the time but i would suggest some art from players and cool skin ideas
---
Looks amazing! I wish Supercell would use your icon instead!
---
This is perfect. I understand with the original, giving her no teeth was an attempt to look younger and cute, but I‚Äôd prefer she kept the teeth in her smile. Great work! (Also the eyebrows being black was strange)
---
Oh god that‚Äôs actually a subreddit
---
Beemo saw shit after his time in Iraq and Afghanistan. Never again will his friends he killed, for he has become the killer.
---
Oh ok thanks
---
That's so good!
---
We have been blessed THANK THE LORD I HATED THAT MAP
---
seems like they have deleted some of the showdown maps
---
8-Bit‚Äôs face in this skin should be spinning slowly
---
Holy fucking shit 1500 only?
---
That's fucking cool. Taking into account that 500 trophies is easier to reach you could as a free player rack around 500 points per season which would be like 1/3 of a box which is around 3 and a half boxes (not bad).
---
That's barely a nerf from previous plain star tokens rewards.
---
Is Leon Will Have Custom effects?
---
Ah I‚Äôm the same, full em up!
---
I actually get triggered when I don‚Äôt see them with a little yellow in the bar üòÇ

Sadly no

How to agree twice???But die???

YES PLEASE
---
Btw I had my coiled snake bar charged up. My guess is that the timing between the breaking of the wall and the frank super glitched and the game thought I had dashed to the other side.
---
He doesn't mean literally Millions,he mean that he opened a lot
---
yeah most of the choosed maps in this post are either 1 or 4

Pam‚Äôs was 300 damage with Mama‚Äôs squeeze not 400.

Thousand lakes removed :(
---
Yeah and the sad reality is after one reset every single brawler if you have pushed em past 500 will be empty bared :(

Now PAM needs a dryer machine skin

Supercell's new icon:  Woah ith that me but with theeth? And correctly colored eyebrowth?
---
Just wanna know ;)
---
I don‚Äôt really like kairos titles like ‚Äúthings you missed‚Äù ‚Äúwhat you didn‚Äôt see‚Äù at least Cory for the most part is straight up on his titles
---
No, you didn‚Äôt
---
Me want a legendary brawler
---
but the second one doesn't have much bushes in the center it's almost have an empty center
---
How did people get this image?

New brawler
---
Nah there's way too many. Sorting by new will show all of them
---
...
---
That thing's a spawn from satan. They ruined her. 
---
The remodel is decent I guess, but I'm not sure about it being an improvement to the current model looks-wise. And dear god please tell me that that icon is actually a joke because I'd rather keep the one we already have if that's the other option. It's such a horrible depiction of Piper. And I mean no harm to the artist who made it, it's actually well done, it's just NOT a good representation of Piper. At all. It's horrible.
---
Dear god help me if they're not going to change it back.
---
Wow really? Last time I checked was 70ish...

I‚Äôm just under 15000

---
Okay masta, let's nerf da ho
---
 Beeeeeeeeeetch
---
 Birds are a little strong?
---
Definitely not a fan of Darryl's nerf but ill have to see his new attack animation to judge if it was a fair nerf.
---
Still without SP Darryl has always been a poor man version of other Heavyweights on every gamemode.
---
Where is she teeth?
---
Might need a battery replaced but is good
---
Nah it was more fun to play with shell shock anyway
---
Do you like my idea?
---
Ye I did.... got it around 8 to 9. I can send a screenshot that i have it now
---
At least Band-Aid isn't OP anymore
---
This looks great!
---
Everyday we stray further from God.
---
Tara mains too
---
That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs at, it can go up to100
---
Fain
---
The star power wont activate in big brawler
---
You forgot the best thing in the whole update - the new ranks
---
Bro no teeth? Looks like she‚Äôll give some great sucküò§üòé
---
How? ;)
---
Source?
---
When I watched the brawl talk video it looked like it took 3 hits instead of 2, which is not technically 0.3 but closer to that than 0.4.
---
If there‚Äôs been an official announcement about the rebalances I‚Äôd love to see it!
---
Colts better because he‚Äôs speed
---
Yes !!! Finally !! One of the WORST maps
---
How :) ?
---
https://youtu.be/6bA33hvHbeo sorry 148
---
But I want a Rosa skin
---
I am still a beginner but i can tell you than nothing motivated me like re-creating videogames i like üòÅ
---
Coach corey made an leak video with a lot of stuff in the next update, aswell as balance changes
---
Go on then
---
Are you from crow gang
---
Mortis isn't that great in brawl ball anymore though

Thank you üòÄ

I hope and pray that this is a joke
---
I like keep my brawlers at the trophy level equal to their power level. Helps me out a lot when playing.
---
Every heard of taking good care of your battery?
---
I mean just look at this dumb post.
---
And a bigger nose.
---
I love bo's icon ,its very nice.I dont want to be remodeled and look like a 5 y old kid.
---
r/brawlmaps for map submissions!
---
Why is brawl ball a permanent game mode? God I have a hatred for it
---
lol, that was the change that stuck out to me as well. I tend to enjoy siege and bounty the most and brawl ball probably the least. Can see myself foregoing some star tokens in the future...
---
That is like, a genuinely terrible icon. And I don't mean the art. I mean the depiction. I'd rather burn my eyes off than call that Piper's icon. Please for god's sake tell me that's not final, because that is NOT awesome.
---
And to be honest, the remodel isn't all that better either, looks-wise. It's ok. Just as good as the old one, not better, not worse. It kinda got rid of her essence as a character, it doesn't really feel like Piper anymore. You can see it's her, it just doesn't feel like her. At least her eyes are open now, I guess.
---
I love you
---
Underrated
---
Aka crying in El Primo
---
one of changes could be the icon
---
SOMEBODY ONCE TOLD ME
---
Making skins before the brawler releases. That‚Äôs reddit
---
What about ma boy OJ
---
Cause when you player get the second one they won't look at the other one besides some bushy maps
---
Thank you VoxelGuy, Very cool
---
#crow gang
---
True. But now I'm waiting for tomorrow. We got Sneak Peaks today. So, I guess the chances are far higher this time.
---
√Æ-mi place sa maninc bebelusi in timpul meu liber

yeah üî• maybe op? ü§î
---
I mean, it's not that bad now.
---
It‚Äôs true I‚Äôm the 8 year old
---
Obviously, the ¬´¬†new¬†¬ª one
---
Yeah, and maybe a larger pupil too.
---
I agree #pleasegiveherteeth
---
ah yes
---
We dont even care about rush wars cause we are going to wait 100 years for it anyways
---
Only gripe with this one is that the teeth are too big and look like they're rounded towards the middle. The old one had the teeth round towards the right. It's hard to describe, but all I can say is to look at the older icon ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Other than that yours is spot on! Got my upvoted! üòÅ
---
I actually just unlocked Bibi this morning so something there I suppose, but I would probably rank brawl ball as my least favorite game mode. Love the video though OP so take the upvote, lol ;)
---
That icon makes her look 12, lol. ‚òπÔ∏è
---
that me now
---
Holy goddamn fuck that's the funniest fucking thing i've seen wall day
---
Wtf did you brought upon this cursed land!
---
Same dude. Lol
---
Also watching KairosTime's latest Olympics video is a great way to know a lot of specific data about the new brawler
---
Wait its that spike dock we‚Äôve seen in the last few years interesting
---
I think gene will get much more love after his new second star power!!!
---
This Shelly's a bot.
---
Fallen Kingdom memes never die
---
Where's the crow buffüò≠
---
Yap... And she's icon is ugly.   VERY ugly
---
Look at shelly‚Äôs eye brows on both icon and model
---
just noticed the eyes are switched left one used to be open
---
Remember when Brawl Stars was in Beta? Wasnt very popular was it?
---
YES!  THATS WHAT SHE NEEDS!
---
I'm excited of Piper's remodel. But they should better not change her icon...
---
Nah I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a problem.
---
Cool uptade
---
Wow why did they BUFF Sponge?
---
Wait does heist seige and bounty switch out
---
Man, what‚Äôs the stats? You done goofed with a bad crop.
---
Pipis confirmed
---
Nice post!!!
---
Wait wait wait they still didn‚Äôt update the poco bc of the purple/green heart he has now no heart i think and the old version of tars the eye is still painted and nit real i guess
---
Wait wait wait
---
Leon healed 600 pre-update with Invisiheal...
---
And what‚Äôs the +200 on Shelly?
---
THATS ONE MILLION TIME BETTER
---
so much better
---
[visible confusion]
---
Alright fair
---
No, the actual is still the one on the left, but it used to be the one on the right when the game was in beta
---
He doesn't need one
---
She‚Äôs bit skinny
---
Do you want to get hired by supercell?
---
It's now literally midnight in Finland, so hopefully tomorrow, maybe even later. Just have patience...
---
ADD IT FOR MORE DOWNLOADS
---
Actually the old piper icon matchest perfectly and its fine
---
Huh? dynamike does more dps than Leon and his reload is definitely on the slower side
---
I think trophy balance change is important now
---
yep finally i can push every day
---
Im excited of her remodel. Now she looks so cuuuuute! Especially her skin. They did everything well - added hairpin from the icon, opened her eyes, removed ugly gloves and did her animation realistic. But the new icon... just kill me...
---
Then I can say that shelly isn‚Äôt fun to play because she‚Äôs not rare at all.
---
good point
---
Well I mean it makes some sense to go against having an icon that looks quite disturbing for a majority of players, but bro I understand the stupidness of posting ‚ÄúLeon skin plz, bo icon remodel plz, etc.‚Äù since there isn‚Äôt even a damn problem of brawlers without skins, like cmon
---
34%
---
Gene's new star power sounds pretty fun tbh
---
Did you do it? 
---
Yes.
---
What did it cost?
---
Thousand Lakes :(
---
yeah its quite "old" too (i mean its just some months old but yeah)
---
walter
---
Tide pod ammunition
---
Shelly is transgemder confrimed!
---
Im am angry now with u. Because I can stop seeing the 8 bit Losing animation (Cuteeeeeeeee)
---
Sorry but ur idea look more scary lol
---
wish bibi got a remodel to look less squat, like in the brawlopolis trailer
---
H I G H L I T E D
---
Dunno if this is a real mtg card I‚Äôm buying 80
---
I'm #TRIGGERED
---
It is fingering itselfü§êü§ê
---
I want more giveaways for the brawl stars subreddit
---
What did you say?
---
Stfu I love that skin
---
Brock got nerfed
---
El Primo has the shortest
---
Crow doesn't need a buff =)
---
Even better
---
To me the remodel is adorable, but the icon kinda ruins it. Maybe it'll be like the Tara icon where u can select the old one as ur profile pic. But yeah, I like the new one a bit better because her eyes r adorable and her chin looks a lot better. Then again, that's my opinion
---
Oh, well u shouldn't still steal this
---
the wining pose must be the same, so we can Remember her
---
I like it!
---
Wrong place bud
---
except the icon the icon looks like dynomike face with make up
---
We will never see them again. Goodbye Ricochet...‚úùÔ∏è
---
Nice idea. I can't stay shaking with this joke of a remodel
---
User code?
---
Yea but 8 bit range is long and crow wouldn't even want to come can touch 8 bit.
---
Give this guy a Gold medal
---
He is a shark, sharks don't eat candy (Or do they?)
---
Imagine If El Primo gets remodeled....
---
He will either look like Ricardo Milos or Ignacio from the 2006 comedy film, Nacho Libre
---
Whenever I read the word "butterfly", I hear PEKKA's voice in my head.
---
What do you mean ?
---
Just use...
---
*Whispering:* V.P.N
---
Guys im sh-
---
Remodels nowadays are getting out of hand tbh
---
 #S ^harpshooter
---
LOL I THANK
---
Piper looks like cinderella now
---
S h i b e:‚ÄùGET BEHIND ME‚Äù
---
Hmm how do you know the others will remain all caps?
---
Developer build duh
---
In my eyes, the problem is the eyebrows, makes it sort of look like she's wearing a wig
---
wtf why do you state the obvious?
---
üé∂Be a manüé∂
---
Dev build
---
Thats true. I think its balanced
---
About 10100
---
it needs better eyebrows too
---
*voxel
---
The fire pattern change would be a huge buff. Now it is impossible to hit all bullet in point blank.
---
Well yes but actually no
---
Teaming sucks
---
Way better.
---
ƒ∞k but its a legit stratagy
---
I was pushing my Penny on TL and my Mortis on SC, but BB will be permanent, so i still have a option to push Mortis
---
People that played before they added the trophy road and got free brawl boxes for it  
---
EXTRA STONKS
---
Can we get an F for Side Story? My fav map
---
Nice Binny
---
Ik right it should be a second option in a 1v1 mode bc king of the hill would be 1v1
---
Eugenio btw LOL
---
I wish there was power boxes on power drinks in the training cave
---
No matter what you select it‚Äôll say 3 hours because that‚Äôs when any of the 5 events refresh lmao... I‚Äôve been playing on and off since day 1 of beta.
---
Damn he is much slower than I thought
---
Well boys, we did it, Pat on the Back is no more
---
&amp;she isn't thicc anymore
---
Hell yeah I'm happy! NO MORE ME VS 9 SHELLIES IN SOLO SHOWDOWN üéâüéâüéâüéâüéâüéâüéâüéâ
---
Agreed! While I like the remodels design, it doesn‚Äôt work for Piper at all. Her voice lines don‚Äôt match her appearance at all. She‚Äôs too young looking to match the older adult voice... To be honest, I don‚Äôt even recognize the new model as Piper, it looks like an entirely new brawler
---
An attempt to try to karma farm lmao
---
*frank's super animation*
---
#F
---
That is so incredibly op to be honest(Next bandaid) I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll have the guts to rush an 8-bit with a star under their brawler...
---
Thanks for your art post! If you are not the creator of this work, please make sure that you have included the source, or to  comment it here! Unsourced art may be removed if you are not the creator.
---
I pefer the new one
---
And please don't play Mortis.
---
A stupid icon will not make BS be a bad game, but her new icon is ugly af
---
No, cuz she looks younger
---
And her umbrella is not as it used to be
---
700 is new rank
---
Nobody complained because it still looks good on Shelly, it looks abysmal on Piper
---
#JVGRP9VR
---
This new icon is nightmare worthy...
---
Her umbrella does not look like an umbrella it looks like a shotgun
---
Make him shoot tide pods!
---
I got my tick to 600 without buffs
---
I remember when the chat before the premiere starts was "Dont kill Brawl Stars" and something
---
Lol, the new Piper is adorable! And they should know that she still has a chest, she's just blocking it with her arm and gun
---
#FirePaul
---
Bruh last year I reached 10k with 19brawlers it is much harder than u think
---
She looks much better
---
Well, shelly counters mortis so I tought putting her here
---
The super bull collecting all the cubes and running around doing nothing is so real
