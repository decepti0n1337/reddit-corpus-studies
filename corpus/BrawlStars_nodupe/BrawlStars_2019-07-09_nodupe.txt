I know all of these tricks am i a pro?
---
---
---
lol not even enough for an upgrade
---
supercell just has to change their chest spawns so a minimum of one chest spawns next to each person and then the rest of the boxes are closer towards center to balance the start of the match more.
---
It's called testing buddy...
---
Lucky üçÄ and rabbits foot
---
Also piper accidentally auto supers when in danger so she would land in same area
---
MeüòÇ to 700 trophies with her on this map, she is op
---
Siege itself is a 3v3 mode. It doesn‚Äôt make sense for it to be bigger than itself.
---
It is a good map but not the modifier
---
Robots will remember this
---
I‚Äôm so glad you cleared that up. I had no idea what was really going on there. üôÑ
---
They see me rolling

Dude franks I do

That's sounds like Island Invasion but that wouldn't change anything because the bush patches are still there, lake in the middle is still there

Lol no, just a short and simple name

Sry babe it was an accident
---
Now that u watched the vid u are!
---
Your grammar sucks, fix it
---
Difference is you just land into a Shelly super here
---
I mean with sone tweaks, it can be 5v5
---
I kinda agree because of his spot spread... The shot spread is so strange that even you are so close to a box you can‚Äôt land all the shots on it for no reason
---
Ive never seen anything so relatable in my life.
---
It was patched.

That‚Äôs the joke he skipped it

yeah i know i‚Äôm just saying it isn‚Äôt really unfair or anything if you have to pay a few more cents worth of gems for that big of a bonus compared to the 900 one

I never seen it

Hot Point is awful. Cavern Churn is an okay map, Eye of the Storm sucks. Hot Point is tons of teaming, and terrible endgame - Cavern has the same problems, but not as bad. Hot Point tries to appeal to various types of Brawlers, but screws them over simultaneously.
---
Me too.
---
OOOOOHHH MUCH BETTER!

i love your art

I love you both

I LOVE this when the boss spins I do it to since bosses just pretty much get the same tokens if it losses

*OH GOD PLEASE NO*
---
Passage. And I agree. It was awesome.
---
hey look its minecraft!
---
Why first person tho? If it is in first person that it will be trash and than it isnt brawl stars too
---
Literally EVERYONE in this comment section is saying he's awful without the star power. That's not even close to truth. If you mastered him, you'll be taking out primos and rosas in seconds WITHOUT the starpower. You just have to know the god damn positioning. I don't get how it's THAT hard to get all shots, when you literally have an AUTORECHARGING super that can almost always guarantee 3042 damage per shot to not an exellent darryl, but at least someone who knows his super's zones.
---
You know what, I actually feel where you‚Äôre coming from. Maybe have total trophy count influence matchmaking slightly. I don‚Äôt like playing with newbies who just pushed shelly up 400
---
Thanks :)
---
Says the guy who wont leave me alone in solo showdown
---
I feel you on this. I grinded to hit 8k trophies to get a megabox and all I got was tick powerpoints. I'm missing 4 starpowers, gene, mortis, and Bibi.
---
Me, every time in the last 2 seconds of gem grab.
---
That's sweet
---
And I'm about to get my shelly to 500.
---
45% is Okay  üëå
---
Legendary brawlers are not better than any of the other ones
---
Mecha Bo: ‚ÄúHalt there citizen, we must see your idea of you are allowed to enter. If you do not comply we will eliminate you.‚Äù
---
Shelly: ‚ÄúEnter what?‚Äù
---
Mecha Crow: ‚ÄùShe does not compute, we must eliminate her now!‚Äù

Shelly: *Supers then both to dust* ‚ÄúHa ha ha.‚Äù
---
Great job
---
Thx for the credit man!!üôÉüôÉüòä sorry in late lol

Thanks...
---
Also bo with star power yeeting everybody
---
Yeah!
---
I too have the 39 gems offer but only 36 gems
---
300 IQ play.
---
1 shot = Hello teammate
---
2 shot = Go over there
---
3 shot = **STUPID SHELLY ON SIEGE**
---
That scares me. If I can‚Äôt see it then might as well sit there.
---
It's pretty easy to figure out once you start the game.
---
Thank you u/Merganact, very cool
---
I laughed so hard when he jumped
---
Yeah only affected turrets have star beneath it
---
And well oiled is not
---
And Automa ‚Ä¢ TICK reload is also not
---
So It's safe to assume that ticks sp changed and they forgot to remove the star beneath it OR its his third sp they have equipped in their build 
---
They actually ahve 3rd sp made for few brawlers for future
---
But it does deal damage LOLOL
---
but that clip wasn't showing that tho
---
Suffering from failure
---
I think its a hidden instinct that humans have had before going into battle, a signal to make your enemies aware of your presence to hopefully strike fear in the enemies hearts in hopes to gain an advantage in battle so although some people do not do this the great majority of us do and in doing so proves the you are indeed a warrior
---
Well i leveled up shelly to lvl 9 and had her maxed out (with the two star powers) like in 2 weeks in brawl boxes
---
if you break the wall,the Darryl's Paradise opens
---
Nah man I love being able to play my untouched Brawlers again; a lot, actually. I dislike just how \*many\* free trophies it gives, as well as how much it pushed back the theoretical area where skill matters (from 300s to 800s; 60 consecutive 3v3 wins as opposed to 100). I love the idea they had behind this, and I love how it ties into the Star Point system. Just *really really* wish they either did it differently or held off on it until after the break.
---
Do a barrel roll
---
Needs to be maybe 6 or 7 trophies a win, and have other ways of receiving star points
---
Island invasion was just as bad. If you don‚Äôt immediately don‚Äôt go to the middle after spawning then you‚Äôre dead because of Bull‚Äôs and Shellys camping.
---
(Plus I worked to get some 500 trophy Brawlers pre-conversion and am salty my work means so much less now.)
---
How much trophys you have when you get him?
---
Stop rushing her. Or play her counters...
---
Very true
---
Most likely a wagon wheel
---
Shelly need nerf band aid and super attack.
---
It's balanced and Shelly is still a pretty bad brawler on most maps but watch she gets nerfed anyway because of these whiners.
---
Im worried about spike
---
Rosa super blocked her from picking the ball somehow
---
Then take a shower :/
---
can we talk about the fact that many things about him are delayed? maybe its just my connection since servers in this part of the world suck a bit but it takes darryl like 0.1 seconds to completely fire which makes a lot of missed shots (like a lot, too much, like not even excusable by any means) or shots that should hit but just wont, or when you try to escape and use your super but it takes that same small delay to escape so it hard to calculate mentally when to fire anything in the middle of a 1v1 fight
---
Spread the word!
---
Lol no I'm not on YouTube. Thought about it tho.
---
Don‚Äôt downvote him it‚Äôs actually true
---
Yeah but that 9 Frank PowerPoints makes up for it.
---
Thanks! Idk if I should make another, what tips would u guys like to see? Showdown?
---
Buff mortis
---
I got my first character to 300 from 0 in one of my first days playing thanks to this mode lol. I actually never use El Primo outside of this mode. 
---
The one day I unlocked him I saw someone playing him the first time brawl ball came up for me. I switched to him next game and stayed winning with two randoms, a Frank and a Rosa, for like 15 games straight. It was so fun, probably the reason I stuck with the game despite never having that kind of experience again. 
---
Ps: I‚Äôve been playing only a month or so now.
---
I would say they figure out something slightly different for the conversion of trophies to star points/maybe even how to get star points in general, and do something different for the trophy system.
---
Multiply all trophies by two; this includes gains, losses, overall trophies players have, rank quotas, and maybe even marks in the trophy road. After this, modify the new amounts of trophies gained and lost by a few. for example, at 300, instead of gaining 10 and losing 10, you could gain 11 and lose 7. At 400, you could gain 11 and lose 8. At 500, you could gain 10 and lose 8, etc. Kinda like adding decimals to the current system, I guess.
---
This is sad. Professional players aren‚Äôt good enough for 3v3s so they team in fucking duos.
---
This is pure bullshit ü§¢
---
Welcome to every single one of my mega boxes, at least you have all of the brawlers
---
It‚Äôs because so many ppl push in showdowns are literal shit at 3v3‚Äôs at their trophy level.
---
I think you fucked up by posting this video. Everyone is proving you wrong
---
Dude your a random to you know
---
A good player can make any brawler seem good.  My meme refers to your average random matchup
---
THis IS toO EasY!1

It‚Äôs one of the best maps!

i have all other brawlers except for legendaries...

Tick has area control wtf you talking

Somebody posted this before you... Just saying, I think it's stolen

I thought about adding best comps and how to make one or best brawlers even but that would depend entirely on the map and would take too long

For a second I saw a banana.

They were in a team matchmaking all goes off by 100

Quality post sir, here‚Äôs an upvote. :)

Send this screen shot to in game support. They‚Äôll at least change his name to Poco or Nita or something lame like that.

üòÇüòÇüòÇ Your forgot WORKING 2019 - NEW - EASY GLITCH

Good idea! But it might be better if the attack indicators were less opaque so they don‚Äôt block the game at all. Great concept art though!
---
Haha this is so stupid
---
True ..
---
Not really. I re-colpred it. Maybe it looks like it... i didnt notoced tbh
---
All about the Star Power. He's really awful without it.
---
Someone tried to do this shit to me as a shelly - when it got too quiet that was the first place I checked and found em, double super'd them
---
I dunno how people fall for this still lol
---
I like this idea!
---
Well if you have that, you have Star Shelley right? That was limited
---
Thanks
---
You forgot about martin that bitch.

F&gt;!ind!&lt; yourself.

The rules of this subreddit don't forbid low effort post and it's also related to Brawl Stars. So idk. Maybe it sucks that this subreddit 80% is made out of memes and 80% of those are trash but I can't change it
---
Ok thanks alot
---
Also, THIS IS ORGANIZED TEAMING. they were 99% on discord
---
its better for recording the replays
---
The map today is literred with shellies wtf are you talking about
---
isn't it 1000/19 gems? I have a screenshot of it.
---
judging by that alone, 1000 token/20 gems means 2000 tokens/40 gems which if you ask me 2000 is way more than 1400.
---
Literally at 7.3k rn and still don‚Äôt have BiBi, any mythics, or legendaries T^T
---
F
---
Rockabilly Mortis remodel!!!!!!!
---
That‚Äôs where it‚Äôs used :)
---
Hit boxes
---
OwO facw
---
Well, I hope you enjoyed playing cause you *could* be facing a ban...
---
It‚Äôs against the rules
---
I'd give that honor to Eye of the Storm or Hot Point. Just don't use stupid Brawlers and it's a great map. Throwers, Rico, any close range tank Brawler, even Mortis. Bo, Brock, and Carl too. Just not Piper. *Not Piper.*
---
Wow, people actually stick together in Snake Prairie?
---
I have 2 legendaries 2 mithics 3 epics
---
You dont get it. This is organized teaming
---
Trying to kill Tick
---
Trying to kill Leon

And your highest Brawler is???

Waw more upvotes than expected for a shitpost. thanks guys üòÇüòÇ

It will kill you in a few years so don't feel bad for it

No, it will see this comment and will spare me for it

Lmao i‚Äôm dyingüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

That‚Äôs exactly the reason she can‚Äôt talk to Carl
---
No stupid ass bitch
---
This is sad can we get a leon skin
---
It think the map is ok but theres so much boxes
---
They don't bush camp. Camping brawlers are Bibi El Primo and Bull perhaps Ross
---
Who cares. It's the losers fault for playing with randoms in the first place.
---
Bro that‚Äôs almost the same story for me
---
I got bandaid yesterday and pushed her from 17 to 19 because I had to go
---
You know nothing about high level gameplay so just shut the fuck up
---
Very sad but t isn‚Äôt getting enough attention so i dont think they will see it

No, the games system is bullshit.

You are mean

Actually happened last bounty map. We went 41-0

A bit bold you are assuming my skill level. Just because you might claim you ‚Äúhave no problem‚Äù because you ‚Äújust run shelly counters‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not OP. 
---
It should go up from 40% to 60%. I still don‚Äôt understand why people think a no power cube shelly should be having 10k+ potential health, (with an already devastating, immobilizing super) unless you just want to capitalize shelly trophies.

This is awesome! Would love to see a Darryl x penny

I give up
---
Thanks man, what mode should i push mortis in?
---
Yessss
---
Good hand and eye art
---
I've seen thousands since it's removal lmao
---
Personally i prefer him on duo showdown over everything else, then bounty and gem grab. The thing you need to consider is that mortis is very map dependant. Open maps leave you vulnerable to attacks but closed maps have shotgunners.
---
Tbh I thot it was le pam
---
What about poco
---
Ive never understood the people who say she is easy to handle and you need to keep your 'distance'. Distance my butt, shelly simply walks into any attack and bulldozes half the brawlers now thanks to band aid. She has everything - high health, long range ( equal to crow wtf?), and her god damn super which seems to do 10000 damage every time and she can keep chaining it over and over. And what do supercell want to do? They fricking buff her after every update
---
Same thing different filters. The original I hardly different from the current Piper model...
---

---
I prefer playing 3v3 with your friend

Skin or no skin?

"This game is jerk"  
---
Such nasty language, I'm appalled.
---
Ghastlara
---
I disagree with the enemy cuz all the dagger will miss
---
Dude it's amazing
---
In all honesty this would prob lower the skill required, I believe u should only have this if you are under 100 trophies with that brawler, then it disappears.
---
#G I B U S
---
This has happened to me before and i recorded it and sent it to Frank before, asked him if this is a banable action and he said no.
---
Thanks a lot!!!

Yes, losing matches coz of it

jUst a ReGuLar dAy aT thE oFfiCe

OMG I just got poco dude hes the best in gem grab

Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.

You know you‚Äôre no more a random when you already know everything

The only legendary you will ever get

Fk off

This is the period of Omen's members, but this is not new.   
---
It was already like this before with QLASH JC club. 
---
I saved there  [brawlstats](https://brawlstats.com/) profile and send them to supercell but they did nothing.
---
That's how it feels.
---
How dare you forget your 6 gold
---
Uhhh you must khow cavern churnk come back
---
Let me guess.3k trophies or less?
---
Too bad, i broke my lungs.

If you really think about it, this is around 800 trophies in pre patch trophy count. Still impressive nonetheless!

Whoever was that, and was teaming i duo showdown: I genuinely jope you get PERMANENTALY banned, so ur not EVER able to play this game EVER AGAIN! If there is even a chance you see this: shame on you, uou iddiot, you bitch, you bastard, you pus*y!!!
---
Stfu that opinion of yours is trash.
---
1) shelly is not bad by any means.
---
2)shes broken
---
3) SHE DIDNT NEED THE PAST 2 BUFFS SO YEAH SHE DOES NEED A NERF.
---
4) just like rosa shelly needs a nerf to her super charge rate so she cant chain.
---
5) supercell listened to the idiotic "buff crow" movement so why wouldn't they listen to something that's actually needed.
---
Literally solos anyone especially with band aid
---
Kruk
---
I mean it's just one mega box what did you expect?
---
Nie≈∫le
---
Is it just me or are Jessies the most toxic out of everyone
---
Imagine 5v5 heist with like 5 bulls all charging in at the same time
---
I pretended to team in duos because I was getting pinched.
---
So when I "teamed" with them I just went to the corner and healed, let them fight it out.
---
Then I killed them all
---
So sneaky lol imma try it next time
---
Dafuq i thought that was a mistake
---
How'd he get there
---
yeah lmao
---
I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs a good idea cuz there are 10 brawlers and so little space because of all the water so the game will be finished in 1 minute
---
This isnt just teaming. It‚Äôs organized meaning they are communicating irl. Did you see how they didnt even bother to attack each other?
---
And why do I have 6000 trophies and no legendaries? F for me
---
Same the teaming in solo has also increased since the trophy changes, it has ruined the game for me.
---
üòâ
---
ouch ouch there goes all the gems
---
Yeah, that's tough when u have to team in duo ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I‚Äô m okay with actual teaming. It‚Äôs a strategy or whatever. But this shit is organized teaming. They are literally communicating irl.
---
What happend
---
How about just started playing today?
---
That means you srsly suck lmao(not you i‚Äôm just speaking in general)
---
Wish I had that offer too
---
Reeepost
---
At higher trophies around 700+ the same thing happens they snipe each other's matchmaking and it's disgusting.
---
What is blue stack? And why is it bannable?
---
Dayum, 11k down to 3k in a couple of days o.O
---
Amazing
---
Wow
---
Downvoted for shaking the replay so much. Would have definitely upvoted if you didn't do it but, oh well
---
That's one menacing robo, incredible as always.
---
Atleast once
---
Hey, amazing work, would be great if you did Regular Crow next.
---
I was literally sweating from rage when i was recording but ok ig
---
How 2 break the barrel
---
Sooooo *COOOOL.* Amazing depiction, dude! Take my updoot.
---
you know sisters :)
---
Bad? At least it gave you 46 coins, I just get 10 :(
---
Congrats to Spike though :D I wish I have him too.
---
Ik, it bad enough in solo BUT IN DUO U GOT TO TEAM?
---
They should get banned immidiatly
---
TAKE MY UPVOTE!!!
---
Mom come pick me up im scared of the ***repost!!!!!***
---
Ikr?
---
Repost
---
Hell yeah
---
Playing against mortis no
---
 playing with brawler that counter mortis
---
I wouldn't say a circle, but I do like the concept of an indicator whenever she has band aid ready.
---
Wth is with the enemy leon name
---
Wow this is news to me for some reason
---
It's not repost dummy -w-
---
Always upvote handsketches people
---
How about first brawler after Shelly, right from first free box in the shop?
---
Too op
---
Tankier than El Primo and Frank
---
Reaches Carls range 
---
Super deals a LOT OF DAMAGE 
---
Reload speed is Fastest, tied with Frank &amp; El Primo.
---
And that's what he gets for thinking you're an ez cube
---
r/sweethomealabama
---
And they were winning 5 and 2 trophies while now it‚Äôs 9 and 7. This is really unfair and SC should take a look at these.
---
I went 50 to 0
---
Looks good, maybe Leon?
---
I like this! Upvoted
---
Chaaaaaaaaarge
---
This goes to all of you: Nope I have been playing since May with this account and I am at  3433 trophies. So next time you are going to say something be a little bit polite.
---
Execute Order 66
---
Absolutely. I already tweeted about this but they just ignored it lmao
---
And my
---
Lvl 110 you earn a mini box...
---
I play for fun too, ive been playing for a year now and only 20 brawlers at 5k, i have half of my brawlers at rank 15 or above so yeah, the last brawler i got was rosa and tick. I guess supercell just caters to the p2p players :(
---
This is really great. I‚Äôm at 11k and am losing reasons to play. I want this in game lul
---
Darryl: get nae nae'd
---
YES YES YES, pls dont ask questions, but i accidentaly bought el rudo primo skin when i clicked it (i was using bluestacks on my laptop, and my laptop lagged)
---
Lol screenshotted from Kairos' post on yt
---
5k is pretty low not gonna lie
---
Makes sense, but players would just grind ant that may lead to people not playing the objective in 3v3 but dealing damage, because star player gets more xp.
---
Whats the point of being a lvl 4 (not rank) bo and fighting against a lvl 10 colt?
---
Looks great! I liked how you included a star point skin as well. Have my upvote.
---
No, you're breathtaking!
---
Ok really? Wdym ONLY? When i was at 5k, i only had 17 brawlers ;(
---
Concepts are concepts
---
yes it would, no hand outs.
---
@ u/onurinho shut up bout the carl uk that u got rank 7 and is embarrassing asf so just stop
---
Night witch mortis?
---
Darryl is an assassin!
---
Oh well thats even more sad :(
---
PC?
---
They could just limit the radius of the jump spell radius. you can't jump more 3 blocks if the jump spell doesn't work over more than 3.
---
No when Leon goes invinsble and he appears behind you
---
are you serious
---
"He is speaking the language of god" says jessie
---
 What do you about the name level pass is it bad or a good name
---
Im at 10k and dont have herüò¢
---
im level200
---
is that offer actually real?
---
This is awesome but not small amount of coins or normal boxes
---
I am at 7k and I also need more reasons to play..

We are in next week

its a bit too ..... op and unexpected.... kinda dont want to be stuck in the freeze or be chased by someone in the rage
---
 ????
---
i think this is a legit tierlist for solo showdown
---
Megalol, I reached xp 100 with 4k cups.. you got the point anyway
---
500 gold for level 90 isn‚Äôt really good by I got your point and I think that it‚Äôs good
---
Sorry, but what "free to play" means?
---
*what did you just upon this cursed land*
---
Leon and darryl can't speak
---
he only argument, pay2win

CHAOS CHAOS, YOU CAN DO ANYTHING!

Yes experience level pass

Get destroyed

People who don't spend money on the game

Heal spell,Jump spell,Rage spell,Freeze spell and Haste spell.....all from CoC.

But getting 150 gold on somewhere like 13k isn't good either

Idk i Don‚Äôt know either what this Guy means or girl

Bro, I'm pushing them to 500 every day each, what do you want to tell me?
---
I‚Äôm lvl 204 lol
---
If you mean Brawlball yes i like it too
---
now bulls have to think 7 times before rushing shelly
---
hahahaha congrats, my penny was rank 19 titled to 300+ trophies and now 420 soon....
---
It's the most fun map I can play when lobbying with my friends, lot of cool tactics and mind games lol
---
Good freakin idea dude but I think 5 spells in such a small zone is a bit to much
---
First upvote!
---
You shouldn't be able to get starpoints from them
---
That crow was like iam gonna die to the thors hammer
---
NOOOO UR USING BANDAIDDDDD
---
there is a person with 13k trophies with no legedary in r/NoLegendaryGang
---
[deleted]
---
A good lore for this one is that a Wizard/Barley has sent lots of spells around the waste lands.
---
Don't waste your time bro
---
Tbh I‚Äôve never really seen a Tick team but that‚Äôs just me, I only push with 3v3 modes above 400 trophies
---
Will make lot of confusion
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
dont worry. supercell is on vacation. they will respond......eventually
---
And then CoC took troops from CR, it‚Äôs one giant crossover fest
---
They can't be banner because as the dev's said teaming is a showdown strategy. That includes duos so until the dev's make a solution you either have to team or don't play the gamemod.
---
Yeah, but I was just saying it‚Äôs not impossible
---
I‚Äôm level 100 and I‚Äôm basically at 5k oof
---
Hollly molly!! How????üò¶üò¶üò¶
---
I got my legendaries under 4k üòê
---
But you shouldn't count it, because you can get those 14 boxes without token doubler
---
What a beautiful day! Let's spin the wheel in Brawl- 
---
*Better luck next time!*
---
i have like 5500 trofies and im lvl 86 or something
---
I don't really care, because this idea will never be in the game: check
---
You gain XP if you win or you lose. If you farm losses with Shelly in the beginning of your brawl stars account and you get Leon skin and Leon, then you‚Äôd get Leon with an extremely low amount of trophies.
---
Close to mine. I'm 8k and lvl 82
---
When you are #1 Gene in Greenland
---
Thats a droideka
---
I think bounty with bushes is good.
---
Too hideous for pain!
---
Tara is worst
---
Yes!
---
I wish I could see a little better what happens if you stopped shaking the damn screen.
---
But it is pathetic indeed. These high level players should be ashamed.
---
Spike is me when I'm spying my best friends lol
---
I'm currently at 10.5k and level 85. e.e
---
I wish lmao
---
You‚Äôre missing the ‚Äúmastery pass‚Äù with better prizes you can buy for only 6.99$
---
A lot of times the circle fully closes for me
---
Happy üç∞ Day.
---
Well if you just wanna check how much will it help to upgrade that brawler
---
It is a different circle
---
Stolen.
---
but barley is a rare and is not hard to get a legendary on the other hand...
---
How the heck you on 11 k don't have  that is unfair l get my first one 4300 trophy ( it was leon ) and my next on 4700 trophy ( it was spike ) and still don't have Crow on 6300 only he and the mythic's
---
OmG i GoT tHiS tOo
---
BuT i GoT iT iNsIdE a MeGa BoX i'm So LuCkY
---
Usually happens in higher trophy ranges
---
Yup
---
Well it‚Äôs Rosa so ehh
---
That eyeless Tick icon...
---
frank 3 shots you and his stun give him enough time to land 2 shots plus super damage is enough to kill you?
---
Shame....
---
And I thought that pro brawl stars players hated teaming and were totally against it
---
what's the logic behind using penny Here.  cannon can't see anything,can't shoot anything.
---
Yep
---
But also hard to reach experience 100
---
Cool, just making sure I wasn't missing something.
---
Good stuff
---
idk
---
spending alot of money on mega boxes
---
why u reply 2 months later?
---
You have instagram? So i can send you my screen shot of that
---
Yes I am too sure it's amazing idea
---
Says me to continue this thread
---
Should have diamonds as rewards too.
---
Or like ‚Äúfree spin‚Äù
---
There‚Äôs always that kind of stuff on wheels
---
I'm confused
---
Thanks! Yeah I was just chillin‚Äô with my fam and then let out a big ‚Äúwhoooooop!‚Äù when I got him! Lol
---
ssssssssstttttttttt
---
1000/19 would be an insane offer. But I'm afraid it's even worse than I remembered - 900/29: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/cail79/im\_very\_unlucky/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/cail79/im_very_unlucky/)

I designed Poco, Rico, and Carl in TinkerCAD, a free online design software. I then printed them out on my Dremel Idea Builder in Hatchbox Wood Filament. You can see the photos and download the stls for [Poco](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-brawl-stars-poco-96122), [Rico](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-brawl-stars-rico-96495), and [Carl](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-brawl-stars-carl-96516) from MyMiniFactory.
---
Is this an idea?
---
U just renamed Showdown.
---
Actualy pretty well apparently people underestimate tara
---
Oof
---
#1 Piper in Greenland
---
Changes are live, people!!!
---
Objectives to play are different. I'm at 13k++ and am quite bored. You're probably still grinding all your brawlers. I stopped at around 500-600 for mine.
---
GhostGamer242. Drop a follow if youd mind
---
Those are some nicely timed supers
---
they saved my ass
---
Normal skin
---
Magnum Boots/ Slick Special, Tough Berserker, Dyna-Demolition, Thorny Life, etc
---
I‚Äôm at lv89 at 8.3k cups soo rip
---
Well u can get xp for losing so couldn't you just set up an auto clicker to hit play and afk farm xp
---
Personally, I think that the Bull skin should only be maybe 1500 or somethin, but this subreddits full of 9 uear olds who want everything for free
---
Actually you will need around 10k or sth since I‚Äôm level 70 and have 7k
---
idk i have bought the 1000/19 twice myself. but yep worse now
---
This looks like a clickbait youtube thumbnail
---
XD nice idea
---
Lucky
---
Legendarys are like 30$ in gems, to supercell that‚Äôs a big deal when you times that by the player base and how easy it is to climb in trophies
---
Extra Carrion
---
üòù
---
Like collecting the 150 gold at 14.5k?
---
What app have you used to write in that font? 
---
Pd: I did a new version of the training cave, the definitive cave, you should see it üòâ.
---
Auto fire
---
8050 trophies and no mythic or legendary.
---
I mean, everyone has at least some monster within them. It‚Äôs naive to think that there is a person that isn‚Äôt or that humans a truly inherently good.
---
Rip
---
And S P I K E
---
i miss this map. its the first showdown map i ever played when i first started playing
---
Me top:)))
---
Night Witch Mortis
---
Bo, he is now the meta
---
You amazed by the gems instead of the coins?
---
Great idea :)
---
She‚Äôs been good to op for the longest time what do you mean
---
showdown is already really annoying with all the modifiers tho
---
You get a  free Leon lvl 100
---
Good answer
---
I miss it too, it was so funny to play on this map!
---
if u get it every couple days or so then this would feel legit
---
It feels so epic leaving bombs in your wake as you win a solo showdown with no kills
---
Ok, tak se asi p≈ôid√°m jako ƒåech kterej v√°m moc nerozum√≠ :P
---
I mean techically, you're also part of the problem
---
Œ£ŒúŒòœÑ‚Ç¨
---
The skin fits brock more than barley
---
Too complex for new players
---
As long as you change the coins for something else
---
supercell should just give us free money overall
---
You have leon on 4k 
---
I am on 7k and no legendaries
---
I should say why supercell
---
Petition to rename it solo showdown
---
Supercell don‚Äôt do ads
---
All I know is gibberish and then I hear eskenen at the end
---
MOI BUSH
---
But they remove the tokens at each season and it means that they decrease the chances
---
Seems great! But if brawl stars/ supercell thinks of adding this I think i would pefer bundles whic include:  coins, little bit of gems (sometimes) ,big or mega box, a special skin (maybe) and maybe starpoints.
---
I know this is a idea and this is a idea for the idea
---
Darryl deserve a voice like his robo friends
---
Buff crow
---
BuT ThAt Is TeAmInG!
---
wait its not double tapped already??
---
holy
---
it also is one of the most criticized techniques at low-mid fps   
---
i mean in a game like APEX, HALO, COD hell yeah, it just makes everything feel smother, and sometimes just like a rush tho, but in a game like brawlstars i dont see any practical use or advantage
---
Csn someone explain
---
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
Oh god. Yes
---
Thanks :9
---
What is associated with the number of trophies will understand Marvel fans.
---
Ah, thank you! Nice meme btw!
---
Sometimes when I have energy drink i feel like I have 100% accuracy
---
Tha skinny boi had reload animation
---
Shelly having her own spot though
---
Peasbadd that then that xp level would have a meaning
---
I have Mortis, but I don't think t–µ–∞ming is bad.
---
Fake, Leon doesn't have voice yet
---
by*
---
Her ranged chip damage ranges from 840-420 at max rank if you can't out trade her you're bad, if you let her get up close to you without her being one shot away from death you're bad.
---
I didn't mention it because it's a non-issue if you know what you're doing.
---
Barley is rare, Leon is a legendary
---
Obviously they won't be as easy to get
---
Leon obviously.
---
Lmao
---
Yeah but kid keep asking for buff
---
ya sure
---
Yeah, but Frank said on Twitter that their vaction started Saturday (Plus Ryan has gone inactive from Twitter since ,June 30)
---
Iike the subtle touch of Leon being gone too
---
Leon‚Äôs already taking her from behind
---
And i know that it copies Carl‚Äôs super but it reloads this just a concept for hw you can use the brawl bar
---
Some Instagram normies steals memes
---
Who cares?
---
Yes
---
U forgot dyna‚Äôs
---
They don't use Twitter like they use Reddit
---
Just how
---
nŒò
---
Rip crow
---
I could swear I battled a golden Mecha Bo a couple of days after the release... Maybe a YouTuber?
---
You guys realise those are pros who got brawlers to 1k in the past, right, lmao
---
Yeah colt
---
His star power got nerfed and its pretty good place
---
His base hp is enough to roll onto enemies without dying
---
But yeah sp makes a big difference but not as much as b4
---
We‚Äôre all just gonna overlook that Leon talked
---
Just because it does not benefit you does not mean it‚Äôs a bad idea
---
Supercell: Stonks‚ÜòÔ∏è
---
Well, it would takes months.
---
Karl after vodka
---
Let's do this for last time

Satisfying
---
Look at my profile I've got another meme
---
But that's how the meme works bro. "My game" is giving "no WiFi connection sign" a glance when he should be with "me". It doesn't make sense in this meme format.
---
Just imagine Mortis whit his star power, jumping over 2 walls at onceüòÇ
---
Wtf, this is stolen and it even stands there. Original artist is u/darryldumplings
---
F*cking copycat
---
Downvote everyone
---
I don't think I'm that good. I just think that I'm always matched with idiots. Also very sus of you to comment on 2 of my old posts within such a short span negatively
---
All though my club has 700k trophies I am 4K ahead of the 2nd place which makes me feel lonely
---
Leon:.......
---
But Tick didn‚Äôt exist in the past
---
They are more normally more active on Twitter so idk
---
I actually hate teaming it‚Äôs not even Dynamikes and barleys that do it the most why on earth do other gangs use us barleys and dynamikes as a way to get out of the truth
---
U better try it with BOSS has went god mode
---
Piper who hasn‚Äôt gotten a skin or remodel and she is an OG brawler at least Leon wasn‚Äôt here from the start
---
You‚Äôre actually gonna buy a token doubler
---
Tara: am I a joke to you?
---
Let‚Äôs not talk about what happens next
---
I was saying that Anthony723 and Lord_Donut1 are completely wrong indeed.
---
Right
---
Darryl would interrupt matches in this map so much
---
I get raged up when a bush camper kills me but I know it was my own fault I forgot to check the bush or got too aggressive
---
Shelly has always been good. Poco is only bad when playing with randoms or in solo SD. If any brawler is gonna get buffed it should be piper or Tara
---
" a bad memes" also thats a low effort meme
---
Nah.... Too much p2w friendly
---
Btw, this is the third time I posted this bc those 2 times I posted it, nobody saw it, or at least nobody cared about it so I thought I should make it on my phone, not on paper.
---
Almost 13k
---
No this will encourage teaming rename it
---
Thanks for feedback anyways
---
This brawl-math...
---
I want the fucking Leon skin so bad, why is supercell mean to him, no skins, no voice
---
Carl is name      ÃÅÕõÕ¶ÃâÕ§ÕÑÃåÃëÃëÕ™ÃÜÃéÕÑÕëÃíÕ¶ÃãÃïÕûÃùÃØÃôÃºÕöÕàÕáÃ©ÃÆÃó¬†Õ¶ÕäÃΩÕÜÕ¨ÕÑÕóÃëÃÅÕ≠Õ§Õ¶“âÃ¥ÕÅÃ¨ÕöÕàÕÖÃ©ÃºÃ™Ã¨ÃòÃ´ÃñÃòÃùÃñ  is my game
---
500*
---
Ok that makes more sense there wouldn‚Äôt be infinite worlds on that that‚Äôs an amazing spawn regardless man
---
Tr
---
Supercell needs to see this
---
How do we see our level in game?
---
I got Leon at 850 trophies and I started playing global, F for you my friend.
---
Poco is balanced. Not every brawler is meant to kill enemies for it to be concidered "balanced."
---
When you see it
---
Poor enemies
---
2 piper powerpoint
---
I want that Jessie to be a skin
---
I‚Äôm at 8.5k and I get 0 BECAUSE I DONT HAVE RANK 20S
---
How the hell is Poco not balanced?
---
Plz do it
---
Man I just got to 7k with no mythics and no legendaries even though I have probability of 0.11 
---
If you can give your # we'll play together
---
Bruh
---
bruh üî•üî•üòéü§£üòú
---
yes.
---
This is excellent advice except I would say don‚Äôt waste gems on discounted mega boxes. Just buy the discounted token doublers and event tickets for robo rumble. You can easily open over 200 boxes in a weekend this way. Way better value than mega boxes.
---
Omg that look soo COOL ¬∞&lt;¬∞
---
6k trophies all Brawlers  :)
---
proof that this game is bullshit rng
---
Thx
---
Yes :)
---
It was an original joke instead of the "I drew Leon" and its a blank page
---
Thx!!
---
Me 2
---
I'm not stoping until you admit I proved you wrong, for the third time I only joined crowgang for the content, I don't know about other people who don't have crow. I wasn't talking about you, I was giving an example if someone has a cat or not. You don't know what's the deal with other people that joined crowgang without having crow, everyone has different opinions and you know mine, plus not just 100 it could be more.
---
God no!
---
Wow!
---
I don't have her star power... :c
---
Can we get an F for frank and Shelly
---
Papyrus Poco
---
Night mecha crow
---
If Brock gets his old model as a skin then that means that will be his 6th skin
---
Pay to play. Pay to win doesn‚Äôt exist in this game. Skill beats power. Just look at this matchup.
---
Great idea!!! I would love it
---
Supercell if you want to improve your game
---
Pls listen to the community, we have great ideas like this
---
Healing mushrooms has left the chat
---
There should be one reward of a new brawler but the lowest rarity it can be
---
Why??
---
Brock looks creepy  tbh
---
Great One Punch Man Reference
---
You love just saying sans and then a brawler
---
Dude I'm level 93 at 10k trophies level doesn't correlate with trophies like that lol
---
Find them...
---
Kill them...
---
If you don't have the brawler before you get the skin, you would get the brawler with the skin.
---
I‚Äôm around 80 trophies away from 10k and don‚Äôt have any legendaries. Just wait for it I guess
---
We need this I‚Äôm like lvl 154
---
Na you would get a skin for your rarest brawler at that time so like spike or crow or a mythic skin if you didn't have a legandary
---
pls, watch my perfil, in my mortis
---
Bro we get 10 trophies for getting first in showdown now how are you having a hard time leveling up...
---
Wait a second I was already subscribed to you lol. That would be awesome to be in ur vid! Thanks!
---
My flair used to be mortis, but I changed it because I love dynamike's old design and star power. Mortis is still my highest trophy brawler though.
---
And the one colt

Hello! Could I please use your clip in my Brawl Stars Highlights series? :) You would be properly credited in the video and in the description of the video. I won‚Äôt use the footage without your permission. If you‚Äôre interested, here‚Äôs our channel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt5A9Y-b\_TnvG6SKYpcPu3g](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt5A9Y-b_TnvG6SKYpcPu3g) . Thank you!
---
Less health and less healing.
---
Ok but leave us alone we‚Äôre just having a conference
---
Why power points? Maybe star points
---
Andre
---
Club:Aliens99
---
At least 8 hours of pushing
---
Leon is a Trap
---
It's available right now for lower trophies players
---
I got crow at 1100
---
NEVER
---
It looks great and all, but I dont think we need more luck in the game.
---
Very good idea!Definetly buyin if supercel add it to game.
---
Wait .... Which one?
---
Please supercell
---
Aka more mushrooms
---
Tick is probably the worst brawler in SD I don't feel bad for teaming this time
---
They reworked it so its shorter and the rewards are no longer double
---
Cancer in a post
---
Nobody would use this lol I‚Äôd rather have devs work on something else
---
tbh i tried to bounce from the wall at the side and   
---
score it with just one bounce but it all went wrong but i somehow scored:)
---
What about his second star power though? Should we change it to 5969 when it comes out?
---
I mean... he's not wrong. Although he could have said it better
---
true
---
Wdym
---
Wow,is this real?
---
1. This will fix itself over time. It‚Äôs kinda bad right now, but eventually everyone will fall into line.
---
2. This is just flat wrong. Shelly‚Äôs band aid is good in showdown. Not so much in team modes. Rico‚Äôs new star, while hilarious, isn‚Äôt all that great. Carl‚Äôs new star is meh at best. His speed throw is far better. Nita‚Äôs new star is only really useful in heist. Rosa‚Äôs new star is better, but both have uses. And colt‚Äôs new star is very good, but also situational. There‚Äôs uses for both. There are some that will flat out replace the old ones and some that aren‚Äôt as good as the old ones but have their uses. Game is not p2w. At all.
---
3. Why complain about this? The exclusive skins are supposed to be end game content. Then everyone whines and now they‚Äôll be much easier to get. 
---
4. Removing season tokens was a mistake. They could have easily made it so you had the token option or star token option at season end. Bad miss here. I agree.
---
5. Siege sucks. Completely ruined a good game. Tara and the shop look nice though.
---
He is a hard brawler to balance
---
Kewl art
---
Brawl stars is not pay to win like CR. A new legendary comes out in CR it‚Äôs gonna take years to max.
---
_**OOOH NOOOOOOOOOOOOO**_
---
It's also available for me with 13500 trophies =)
---
I made this a few days ago r/BrawlStarsIdeas
---
He is the best rn.
---
What if bull: wanted to steal powercubes...
---
But shelly said: BAnG!
---
Watching them burn is somewhat peaceful
---
Making... the magnificent... XD
---
Momentum
---
lol Barley have 6 fingers in the second picture

#***THAT'S GOTTA HURT***
---
Great art! Would love to see more, maybe spike wearing el primo‚Äôs masküòÑ
---
Soup's*
---
Certainly! I've seen some of your video and I would proud to be in one of them
---
That's a bruh moment.
---
I'm gonna go check the game to see how many he has.
---
You have never been more wrong.
---
Tick is fine, I love throwers. But I hate Bibi cause gameplay on her is just bushcamp untill the end and throw enemies into poison. I wish I have Mortis...
---
I think small pathways in the corners would help a lot. Otherwise people will get trapped in the far corner too easily.
---
The spring traps would allow brawlers like bull to shred the IKE, but other than that a great map
---
U threatening me?
---
Sorry for bad grammar me
---
and THAT'S why you don't use autoaim
---
Bruh I don't even have enough money to upgrade my tara to lvl 9
---
bruh üôåü§ôüëèü§£ü§£
---
Naaaaaa, she will find a way to get me anyway.
---
oh i don't like this at all
---
Looks amazing, I can tell you worked hard on it! See you in hot.
---
Old mike and shelly are hilarious. He looks homeless and she looks like an alien
---
Man, I would love yo grind 10 levels to get a box
---
2 ideas 
---
leon skin
---
xp road
---
Why is this downvoted? While I disagree, everyone on Reddit should be allowed to have an opinion.
---
do you know that this is a template dont you?
---
What about it don‚Äôt you like. Just outta curiosity
---
#SaveMortis
---
Mike. He looks homeless while shelly just looks like some weird alien
---
This is Golden! Awesome job
---
I bet randoms still can't pull off a single things tho ROFL but nevertheless awesome post
---
Now it's time to wait 1h for it to load
---
Thats so true man
---
Really where the tnt is only in tutorial
---
It‚Äôs available for me at 16k so yeah I think it‚Äôs everyone
---
You naughty boi
---
Facts!
---
10.000000001
---
Btw spike is so C00T
---
I like the design, I don't like the idea of playing it with squishy squishy crow main.
---
Also, the skin should be a more common brawler, cause if you don't have Leon, then getting to lvl 100 would mean a free legendary and a cool skin
---
:l
---
r/Brawlstarscompetetive
---
Okay, what about 5% or 10% chance to get a diamond each brawl box and remove star points
---
Oh wait, I'm sorry
---
That Rico...
---
Bruh you got 92 tickets as a F2P
---
Sure. No problem.
---
DON'T TOUCH THA CHILD!!!
---
To me this is actually a good idea because I sorta hate how star player is determined. I‚Äôve had a barley on our gem grab team which died atleast 5 times while me and the other teammate tried to last the whole game. He got star player. Atleast when you feel like you aren‚Äôt the heavy lifter you can give credit where it‚Äôs due.
---
SEEING A MEME NOT RELATED TO BRAWL STARS
---
Idea: an option to upvote 10 posts at a time for the same user in 1 click
---
I like it, has enough open spaces/bushes and the walls for throwers.
---
Yes that makes sense, crow is my fav too, I got him at 900 rn and ik how hard it is to play against multiple Shelly‚Äôs with bandaid
---
I have an editor but it's Polish
---
You just make star skin
---
Unzipped it
---
amazing job, upvoted
---
Well yeah. Obviously it‚Äôs supposed to look like the magic archer CR, just like the night witch mortis. Although he could‚Äôve at least added a different color variation of bo‚Äôs eagle hat.
---
walter
---
Good to know brawl stars is still relevant in that year!
---
Ok a simple fix for that if you only get the skin but not leon yet
---
This has been posted a lot. 
---
Honestly, it‚Äôs not hard just remembering distance.... 
---
that‚Äôs apart of good gameplay.
---
Also the center bushes are positioned in the way where you can check them relatively easily in the little entrance parts (idk if that makes sense)
---
If you replaced the 20 power ups by 10 gems, you'd get at least 3 times more upvotes... believe me
---
or just a boy
---
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
This have been posted many times, but if you want to describe it further or make a concept then go for it
---
He mad
---
I'm at 460. I'd recommend breaking up that center section into two separate swaths.
---
Ohhh you play solo showdown lol just play with randoms tu will win more than you lose, and if you don‚Äôt, then accept that your the problem

---
Toma is a shelly scrub jeje
---
Sure that‚Äôs fine.
---
I'm no sure, but is this a repost? Cuz I saw another similar one a few days ago but I'm not sure
---
Ah I see you're a man of culture
---
Powers are OP! But idea is good.
---
Leon eats crystal?
---
Somebody do a mod about this
---
you can buy brain surgery that can make you happy with money
---
or you can buy gems that make you happy
---
Comment the link of the video it‚Äôs in please
---
Cool! BTW nice photoshop skills
---
I don't really see how he's related to Bull either, Bull's completely different from Colt and he's a criminal.
---
Wait so does that mean every time he uses his super he kills himself
---
Do you want a medal ?
---
Nerf super charge rate (like they did rosa since people dont like chain supers)
---
Nerf range of basic attack
---
Small dmg increase (3 shots low health brawlers like crow)
---
Nerf band aid healing to 80%
---
Nerf shell shocked back down to 2.5 second slow
---
Simply a good nerf, not nerfed to the ground like rosa or leon. But one that would balance her.
---
Mortis is not a joke, hes good
---
This literally happened 7 minutes ago
---
Nice
---
Change the power cubes to gems
---
Yeah that happened to me, then I got to 8k üòÅ
---
And that death stare
---
She was never OP in SD...at how much trophies do you play ?
---
Your acount is only 4 months old
---
Dynamike: "what a faggot"
---
Just wait for coiled snake, you will be traveling at the speed of sound
---
But u can‚Äôt deny it‚Äôs impressive p2 tick at 700
---
Idk that happened to me when my Shelly had 509 power points
---
At least it‚Äôs better than nothin
---
Sure I was off by 100 trophies. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it‚Äôs not harder to push above 700.
---
why not in reality???  hahaahahah
---
It‚Äôs on trophies not power level
---
Thats a Great Idea!!
---
Are we just gonna ignore that Carl‚Äôs name is Jack Goff
---
0.196
---
##yes please
---
Gene...why would he pull...LOL XD
---
No mortis doesnt need a buff
---
Piper is to goddess of duo...do we play the same game ?
---
So true range is so broken
---
Make sure , however, that some maps might have a strong meta for certain brawlers due to this, so the spells need to be balanced too.
---
Well every movie/show goes about time travel differently
---
hey i thought of this idea before! :(
---
She‚Äôs got duos and bounty covered. She‚Äôs very lackluster everywhere else in my opinion due to her close range damage being nonexistent
---
Thank god you didn't do it in the middle of the song
---
Thank You
---
I've tried this with a friend before in rockwall brawl but it makes you vulnerable early game when there is only 1 person alive so another team can just come across you for an easy elimination.
---
AMAZING HOLY SHIT
---
"no sign of intelligent life anywhere"
---
If pam is at 500 health and a bull almost recharged his ammo what would health her turret that heals 400 or poco that heals 2.5k?
---
Yeah
---
Then why are you looking at posts from a ‚Äúcancerous, flooded by kids subreddit‚Äù Mr.Adult?
---
Including that not everyone is a ‚Äúkid‚Äù here.
---
Exactly just wait for his screeching solo
---
Supercell: It's now easier to push randoms: well yes but actually no
---
There last words were ‚Äúcya tomorrow‚Äù üò≠
---
But give it a try
---
No, I think he meant pro players who win tournament with cash prize.
---
Nice.
---
Very legal indeed
---
If he had ten gems and did that I would be fuckin DYING this clip is way too funny üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Bibi looks....
---
Her eye
---
Your art looks great! could you draw some more brawlers?
---
What?
---
Heya it's a me.. THE ORIGINAL Duel Concept POSTS CREATOR! So please help a mate out on here and report this post!

Don't talk about my son you little son of a bitch.  If you don't like the post kindly fuck off.  I've made it abundantly clear i don't fucking like you.  Go make your own shit

Now i know why they give skin.
---
Works on mobile
---
Yes?
---
I spent 130...
---
Dumb Ricos, episode 1
---
I don‚Äôt see why you guys are giving hate cause of a Leon at level 100 when it‚Äôs a idea he doesn‚Äôt mean you get Leon at 100. He means skin rewards or you could buy skins at level 50,100, and 150 for example
---
I just reached lvl 100 so I wouldn't complain üòÅ

Wtf is this

Join mine, named ProBros. Has around 60000 throphies, we‚Äôll even give you some pro tips. And make sure the Presidents name is Darth Ro.

Shelly‚Äôs bandaid plus bibi

I like the expression or Mortis‚Äò face...

Of course this is a friendly game

r/lostouija
---
I laughed at sad poco noises
---
I wanna learn how to completely destroy teamers
---
Hey dude this is a repost taken off my concept idea and pls report this for stealing my concept idea!
---
Btw if you havent realized it yet.. I made the original concept art!
---
His*
---
10 levels for a small box? what a scaaaaaam.
---
I never even unlocked Ricochet. I only got to unlock Rico because my luck was bad.
---
Rip dyan, my favourite brawler, his old model was awesome
---
And you see me struggling at power 7 at 10k throphies. This is a great accomplishment. Wonderful job!
---
I mean yeah it's a strategy people will always just find something to complain about
---
Sad
---
After 7 moths I'm almost at 10K
---
Than you. An actually intelligemt person on this sub.
---
Just play duo showdown insted of teaming
---
upvoted
---
I've got 1k wins in both they're not the same gamemode dude
---
Kinda like Rosa
---
But thats not a joke and it wasnt even fast
---
True dat the meta where pam,spike and leon dominated needed a nerf especially pam
---
Its a brawler rarity idea. You can fond it in my profile.
---
I might make brawler ideas soon
---
1.1k congrats
---
About this I'm agree with you, now 800/900 trophies are more accessible. But the other slot are a bit unfair with a -4 ratio for 900-999, -6 for 1000-1099. I don't remember now what was the range with this ratio but it's still a very good achievement to reach. Not  seriously crazy like before, the rebalancement surely make easier to drive a brawler to 1000, this is an objective fact, but it must not be undervalutated
