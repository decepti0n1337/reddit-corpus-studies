How do you propose the developers do that?

Still pretty cool though. I hope to be there soon

With the app in portuguese tho...

This is a whole new level of shitpost

Yeah cause spin bad
---
Trophies dont determine skill dude. You cant call someone trash for having under 400 trophies on a brawler.
---
Top ten photos that was taken before disaster occurred 
---
many*
---
Just that spawn trap is horrible and there is too much clutter 
---
You took it out of another video that already went up to Reddit
---
You will see some in 460-500 range literally unplayable. U have to hide from throwers at that trophy range
---
This idea was made by my friend u/Sky2128. Check his profile for some Brawl Stars ideas. 
---
Yea but the 150 coins is useless
---
It ain‚Äôt much but it‚Äôs honest work moment

Made with mematic

Actually I wouldn‚Äôt say that the time of that loading screen being used is 100% good it‚Äôs definitely not better than portrait lol
---
I think they are eventually going to add this because replay is in somewhat of a beta

That's because those are not in game models. They had the newer art done for the videos and other stuff

It's because they already announced that you could get a free barley skin since global launch. We have all been petitioning the Brawl Stars community to do a lot of stuff, and out of all the news they could give us, it had to be that??

Yes, actually

they do it cuz the replays are in beta currently when it is good and doesnt interfere with servers it will be for all trophies. also this is one of the reasons of the 400 limit
---
#patience
---
Your time will come, young Brawl Stars Player
---
Well you didn‚Äôt RUIN it, just about 1/3 less likely 
---
I'm actually aware of the strafe left strat but it doesn't help that in cases where you are moving right you have to move center to get decent damage. Honestly they should rethink main and super attacks.
---
bUt iTs nOt a GiF
---
true but why the 3 spawn circles in the same place???
---
#Ass Ass
---
that one friend that spectates instead of plays so they at like 40 trophies total
---
Everyone's been telling me that, and I am aware of it, not to be rude. The thing is, how long will it take to take down the trophy limit?? 
---
At least blur the watermark

this is a nice idea i hope to see it in game it is good for any brawler

When they are going to make a nerf to shelly their special is broken
---
Yes, can be taken advantage of by enemy players, but that just means you have to be a little bit smarter when timing your attacks, instead of using ammo right when you get it wait for them too attack so you can dodge it freely and then move to attack them in the down time, he is a difficult brawler to use so you don‚Äôt have to push him any further if you don‚Äôt want to, feel free to wait for a rework I don‚Äôt care.
---
I mean that even when I link my supercell ID it won‚Äôt work. 
---
k thx

Leon: You've activated my trap card!

This is terrible.

Why exactly because you can‚Äôt buy?

Dowmvoted because "petition"

Season reset is evil. I once lost 100 trophies on ONE brawler because of it

Go to the boxes in the shop, click either of them, there will be a ‚Äúi‚Äù icon, click it and it should show the %

No petitions.

With that many wins it should be higher I think

But how many brawlers
---
No, just no
---
actually he lost his toes after walking thousands of miles in the desert
---
I know gonna take me years to get that many
---
It was just a prank her super is insane
---
I swear each one gets worse
---
Her star power is already really good
---
is that splatoon then ?
---
The magic archer crossover (left) looks like a Loki Hawkeye mashup.
---
How did he do that?
---
yeah, I don't understand why the season rewards are so insignificant...
---
I have a better idea, when she is in a bush her star power activates which gives her shots a rainbow effect which causes them to deal an extra 400 damage. But because of the light from the blast of air it is able to reveal the bushes around the shot as it travels, she won‚Äôt damage people in his lit area but it makes it much easier for her to check bushes despite having slow reload speed.
---
Free pam
---
I love this style!
---
4000 isn‚Äôt that high
---
Best frank skin ive seen so far
---
It follows you to your landing point
---
 Piper is sitting pretty well.

Tara is the one that needs an upgrade, her star power is pathetic, it's only good as a way to just slightly bother some people, but most can quickly dispatch of it without much trouble

I see

I played with it

I know but 2 boxes is a very small amount for 4000

Play her in Double Trouble with Energy Drink, that's her best showdown map
---
I‚Äôve been playing this since global launch, though. Isn‚Äôt two months and a week long enough to get used to something like this if it‚Äôs not actually a problem?
---
What's going on?

It worked but when i log out my new account is gone do i need two Gmail accounts for it or u can make two supercell account with 1 Gmail account

I like Chicken Crow, Rockstar Poco, Dinosaur Darryl, Veteran Colt... All your skins actually, but Kimono Leon always stood out to me. I'd love to see him in game.

my tip, don't play her, she isn't that good, but if you really want to play her, bounty is her best mode, open maps are even better, pre-aim your shot and don't spam as she reload forever

Oh shit you are right, time to commit reverse birth

Hawt ü§§

But it‚Äôs sad that there‚Äôs nothing ingame that proves that :( (something cosmetic, a skin or something by your name like Instagrams blue check)

Understand I always want to be original and want play original brawlers on some map but this is hard one to not play shelly or other stuff

But still this map is the only bounty map where shelly works soo thats ok

I think someone already did some drawing of an Hulk - Frank ! Thor would be a good idea as well, but I guess it might be hard to get implemented in the game due to copyright issue

Actually I have an issue with the controls in a specific situation. If I‚Äôm on the left with barley or mike, you can‚Äôt drag fire to the right as far as they will throw, seriously gimping their left to right ability.

Then I blame this cold world - until I realized I lied about my dad he didn‚Äôt leave and I have a good life at home and go to a nice school and have my whole life ahead of me to look forward to. My life is perfect in every way - until I realized I can‚Äôt play video games :(

Play with randoms and hope to get a team with 2 Pams.

Yea but clubs can be ready for that

This is false ? Mortis have the same movement speed as any other brawler (slower than tanks, crow and colt with star power).

do you guys not know how programming and videogame servers works?

Mortis: nope

How many levels of rage bots can have?

Nope, his rarity is like 1% chance to get it even then you could be unlucky enough to get him, have like 150 boxes in total just in case, or check the store for you box chances on one of the boxes 
---
Then you're not good with barley. He is one of the best brawlers for siege. 
---
He is right he should deal 1220 dmg per one bullet

Geez people are actually down voting you, they don‚Äôt understand that crow is actually a really helpful brawler

we need more of these lmao

This would just make people use Pam more lol

how the hell long did it took you to type this (and what will it get ya?)

1. You need orange bar for getting new brawlers

2. Needs high percentage

No one cares.

I think he meant petition

Good work. Really liked that one. This is better than even some of existing maps.

smh you forgot throwing your spawnable at the ike 
---
Looks like a cool idea, maybe make it in a menu that you can close so that it doesn‚Äôt just stand there when you don‚Äôt need it. Also I feel like making them editable **really** isn‚Äôt a good idea. As much as that would be fun, it would be the most cancerous thing to have ever happened to brawlstars.
---
Please make a Bob Barley skin next? 
---
Remove freeze bolt
---
I do agree with your last statement =\] The problem with 1v1 however is that only a few of the Brawlers would actually be viable. Most are designed to work within a team. Some more 2v2 would be cool however! Like a real 2v2 mode outside of SD.

#STOPTHESPIN
---
now I just feel dumb, sry m8
---
‚Äú(Bull)shit maps‚Äù I see what you did there.
---
Hehe
---
Why?
---
Sounds interesting, maybe nerf the damage to +50% poison damage every shoot because shooting a poison enemy resets the timer and the damage would stack up pretty quickly. Would love to see that in the game though!
---
It‚Äôs a joke
---
Poco is a man not an anther transgender brawler.
---
General Kenobi
---
Wait that‚Äôs illegal.
---
Let me explain you what this mess is. 
---
You see the tab up on the top? You may contain 1-7 call outs in it... Just swipe left or right on it and you see more than three call outs. Tap on the required call out and it will be displayed on top of your brawler. Cool, isn't it?
---
Since they are editable, I will make another post related to it on how can you edit them!
---
Those who want to boycott spin can write #StopTheSpin in their call outs. And for the teamers can write whatever they like.... It's just an idea. But I hope people like it. 
---
P.S.- you cannot write curse words in them. Instead you may write $&amp;@*!? Or anything else...
---
Wow how you can say not even close?It's just perfect!üòÉ
---
lacks the health.
---
Looks like my wording is unclear, I meant when you can't push beyond 500, you purposely tilt and then try to get back to 500 so you can play something.
---
Good concept. Showdown isn't a solo game any more. 
---
Some people didn‚Äôt know
---
And then the 1 shitty photoshop of 9 of those skin who got to top post of all time ):
---
Trans Mortis
---
Also if someone gets the energy bolt they can just wipe the whole team
---
Get them to 501, the season reset won‚Äôt make them go down to 500 because 500.5 rounds up to 501
---
The risk of getting all your kills stolen makes it different. It won't be as efficient as in Showdown where 1 kills means more trophies, in Hunt the two parts of the team would have to coordinate to share not only their kills but their trophies ! That means the less skilled of the two will not beneficiate of the skill of the other one like in showdown, he will get all his kills stolen. There is no symbiosis. The only teams will fight each other for a stolen kill or betray them because they don't fear to die like in showdown. I feel like the only teams that could take one kill each other with coordination will deserve their win for great teamwork and trust and it won't be cancer but more like "wow look how this cute couple of Franks give their kills to each other". And last argument -&gt; Respawn = less hate
---
Launchpads would be nice one in spawn 
---
IHateAutoAim yt tilted down to 29 trophies

Low key you guys removed all modifiers from Showdown?

Heya Brawl Stars community, I have some questions:
---
1) Does hand drawn (+editing) look better or does digital art looks better? (Takes longer)
---
2) Should this be a series? If yes, help me come up with a name :/ :)
---
3) I love crosses, so should Undertale make a crossover to Brawl Stars? Is this something you all are interested in? :)

Nice artwork as always üòÉ

I think it's okay to keep the eagle hoodie (with a rework ofc) to keep it consistent with Nita and Leon. After all, they're from the same family. (I'm assuming Nita and Leon are long-lost twins with the former living with Bo in the tribe the latter living in a foster family in New Clash City. Bo is their father.)
---
Whats up with the locket in his neck?
---
Remove auto aim!
---
All the time.  But only when I really need to use the super to escape.  
---
I like how people are being helpful and explaining the humour post
---
thanks u :) i feel it too. first time is so different to brawlstars' pic :)
---
Yeah, aiming to the right with throwers will be gimped if you start aiming down and try to adjust to the right.
---
bird bo x
---
And the worst have star power
---
And Star Shelly as Star Player! 
---
Still nicely doneüëç
---
Wow, coincidence 
---
Drop your tag, please
---
You have only supplied 1 piece of proof, get some footage and I‚Äôll believe you
---
sans normal attack is his giant, bulging, veiny bone
---
sans super is his juicy gaster blaster
---
Bro this fits bo more! And his eye patch is more cool!
---
Because your friends trophies are added with yours 
---
Wow
---
By the look i had an more well fiting name for the map ! Focus canyon or bolt oasis cause those walls and water  tiels rounded in center actualy look like camera's focus or some thing .
---
Bro can you make some more new brawler design?! 
---
I made it using Photoshop CC 2017
---
so true
---
Sans main attack either does nothing or very little damage, while his super is either always charged or charges verrrrry fast and is really good
---
Last brawler I got was frank that was over a month ago I'm missing only the mythics and legendaries.
---
If supercell are able to increase the chance, why not make current drop rate 0%? Call me skeptical but post is fake
---
Awesome work Buddy!!!!!
---
bird box bo
---
But his super is to see how can he see with a blind fold cool idea tho
---
Here's the issue with "more strategic" posts.  
---
You're in a game that's fast paced with absolutely 0 communication. You can only have so much complexity before it's just an enormous shit show.
---
r/BoGang loves this üòçüòç
---
Like it but I always feel that Bo need the Eagle hat but overall it is an improvement
---

Lol it's that one mod Lward beta

 I do not know if nita and leon are brothers, but it is a funny story. 
---
Bro can you add his iconic eagle hat?!
---
Just noticed it ways buff crown in the white clouds
---
Says*
---
Is it just me or did they remove all modifiers from Showdown?
---
maybe next time bro
---
They put Shelly as the worst brawler and that makes it hard to trust this tier list
---
Finally someone who gets it. 
---
thanks bo
---
damn u got good eyes
---
I had worse
---
This map is awful, everyone just camps 
---
Bro u make this in mobile!?? Plzz tell me
---
Remodel is cool then real bo
---
Yea that‚Äôs true, I was just throwing some ideas on how he could be buffed in different ways.
---
I actually kinda like how bo looks already.....they could just improve his original model
---
Nita needs to stop shooting through walls and Pam needs a nerf
---
Bathtub Carl
---
Lets get 888!
---
So cooool ;)
---
seem like their team got destroy by the brock bot lol
---
BUFF CROW!!!!
---
Us indegenous people have been more linked with wolves
---
Thank you!! 
---
Itaaa
---
ikr
---
Nice idea, hope they aprove it
---
Or like Leon
---
His poison should stack up...... They should reduce his poison damage and make it so that it stacks up.... 
---
I'm an Indian myself, but I don't find him relatable
---
ah, that makes sense.
---
Is she trying to seduce me with that pose?
---
Oops!! Just a typo error I put Primo in the place of Promotion üòì
---
Lmao
---
If supercell see this, he will join mortica (night witch mortis)
---
love it!!
---
Maybe Even redo his Start Power? Maybe something like able to have two supers on the ground at once? Maybe to OP but his Star power took a really big hit.
---
This karma whoring is seriously a shit show
---
hmmm
---
Nice picture
---
How many hours do you have on LoL?
---
I mean if you have Bo it's really easy to notice how BORING his design is
---
Are you going to remodel piper soon? I don't like that her eyes are ALWAYS closed. Please reply!‚úå
---
truth
---
Leon is still very strong,  potential of 1760 per damage at power level one is high enough for a legendary.. if you think he is weak just wait to play crow.. 
---
You just have to stop rushing at everyone cause you have Leon and somehow you think he has to be unbeatable.. 
---
Would rather have this than get a crow buff
---
Thanks everyone! That‚Äôs what I figured as well. My strategy has been only to have 1 or 2 lvl 9 brawlers at a time.... in order of my star power preference. 
---
Star shelly is star player
---
just solo showdown
---
its freaky awesome
---
With the app Brawl stars make maker!!
---
Alright I‚Äòll go on trying and hopefully get used to how he is now.. Thanks for the answers :)
---
Ahh. I get it. So you found your friend had a similiar idea? 
---
Okay! 
---
Omg i know have Beny. Go to my profile!! I have proof
---
Spin to win

Hopefully no one

Thank you very much, I value your comment very much!.

He is referring to the indigenous peoples of North America, not the peoples of the Indian subcontinent. Upon European exploration of the Americas, they initially thought they'd landed somewhere in the East Indies; as such, they referred to the America's indigenous as "Indians". It is a misnomer that has stuck since then. Some people find the word "Indians" offensive when used in the context of America's indigenous. Hope that helps.
---
I just got Leon after having crow for months and he is sooooo much easier to play.  Every now and then I get a little over ambitious and try to assassinate a full health bull or El primo and and die rather quickly but that's on me.  He is strong enough to hold his own and weak enough that other brawlers can choose to engage. I whish crow was like this.
---
How does one possibly use terminology so wrong so many times. Mike isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúpitcher‚Äù the in game name for his brawler type, along with barley, is ‚Äúthrower.‚Äù And Mortis being a ‚Äúhand-to-hand‚Äù fighter, I mean come on. Firstly, his class is ‚Äúdashing assassin,‚Äù he is a close range brawler but he doesn‚Äôt even use his hands. But unlike actual close range brawlers like El Primo and Bull, Mortis‚Äô play style is completely different, especially in showdown, and wouldn‚Äôt be classified as close range where you really just want to run the entire match and avoid confrontation.
---
2x?
---
I believe that if you top up Frank Ultimate, you can do damage!
---
Secondo me √© troppo simile a quella originale
---
NeRf cROw PLeaSe!
---
New skin idea &lt;3
---
I would pay for this.
---
upvote thirsty
---
Native Americans are often referred to as Indians, Bo is meant to represent an Indian, or more specifically a Native American chief with the feathers, primitive weaponry and the way he dresses.
---
However it's not supposed to represent the Indian, Hindu population etc. 
---
You can also get in with ‚Äúwall breaking supers‚Äù!
---
Sorry about the earüòÅüòÇ
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure Leon‚Äôs just a teenager with a hoodie, judging from the outfit, also he eats a lollipop in a matter similar to how anime characters hold their lollipop
---
I was having problems today where the game was completely locking up on me.  My phone showed that I had good wifi signal (which it should I am sitting directly next to the router/modem).  Problem was I was losing internet.  Issue was the provider. Eventually it evened out. 
---
Not bad tbh
---
Same
---
dat very IDEAFUL
---
No she said that she accidentally opened her box and wants a lock button to be added
---
Or just be smart and check the bush
---
Forgot about that. I knew I forgot something

He never buys double token i always do i can assure you i have opened more boxes then humt

Now THAT'S an improvement
---
I think bo needs his eagle hat!
---
Thanks mate what should I draw next‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòù
---
I agree with that if it works like an energy drink. But in the notes he said only increased movement speed,  making it easy to escape. I think wiping the whole team would only happen if Bull picks it up at full health and rambo's in
---
While I get its a joke, Darryl takes 40% less damage than what is going to be dealt, not what the hit's maximum potential is. Therefore if Frank normally does 1000 damage, he will now do 200 damage. Therefore, Darryl will take 120 damage
---
Campers are in every game...

The probability is bigger, you can read it on the box info, (where you see your chances).

if my friend at 1.2K unboxed another goddamn bralwer i's slap him

(he has more mythics than me and equal legendaries, i am at 5.5K)
---
ibisPaint X is a great app for editing! Xou can even download fonts there like the Brawl Stars font which is called Lilita One.
---
Of course I do that but you know there are a bunch of bulls coming after your ass and 99% of the time they kill you :'( even if there's a power cube next to them -_-
---
That's a personal choice.  I would upgrade someone other than those two.  However, if Shelly is your favorite to play, I would say go for it.  You will need more coin to get her to level 9. It's 1250 coin and 550 power points to get her to 9 from 8.
---
There‚Äôs a random chance to pull a brawler from a box. Trophies do not equal brawlers.
---
Technically, I could get all the non trophy road brawlers in 20 boxes. Or I can still be missing most of them at over 4000 boxes. It‚Äôs all up to chance.

Hey!

---
If you use her attack the cards flip over after the attack is done
---
And Piper's Star Power is Ambush
---
Man those players were absolute hot garbage. I can see why they felt the need to lean.
---
I love the idea. Great that the acid and freeze bolts are harder to claim but reward you double. 
---
Some notes: Playing this mode with randoms would be even more annoying, they would never know when the right time is to take an acid or freeze and would just end up dying immediately. I think the stun for 2 seconds is way too long, I'd say making it a slower movement instead of stun (imagine being stunned and then Frank stuns you... holy crap). Energy bolt is awesome, ONLY IF, you're thinking of movement speed. If it's going to also be a power upgrade then it's waaaay too op and I don't think it should be in this game mode. I'm fine with the way acid and heal work. 
---
Clever twist on the way siege is played. I think it would only work in higher level gameplay. I think there should be a trophy threshold to reach before this is unlocked.
---
i don‚Äôt get it
---

---
Eh, what's up, doc.

Yeah, it's actually white Leon.

You could've at least make it same font.

I lost over 300 trophies in one night over several brawlers with crow taking the most losses at 120 trophies. This is pre-seige.  Losing streaks suck.  Your luck will change and you will bounce back.  I have gotten all trophies back just not in the brawlers they were lost from. Crow is still tilted.
---
My best attempt at making mew Leon  and it was pretty fun to do. 
---
The chance to be a shiny wood be the same to unlock  shiny mew Leon in a box.
---
that have crow.

It only kills when you eat their hands.

It is lol

Don't autoaim though.

Why? it's not NSFW. :/

Fix it, but there is a problem, the turrets can not be symmetrical since they occupy 2 spaces and the medium is 3 spaces, so there will always be a space
---
Seems a bit confusing but it's very simple. If you need anything write me in chat
---
We're friends the. It's all right, we all hate teaming. #Stopthespin.
---
Wow this is very nice 
---
Mortis because he's fast, unique, fun to play and I just like assassin types of brawlers
---
Just put the top turret 1 left and its okay ;)
---
Want me to make more of these????
---
But he isn't sans
---
Yes the picture posted Supercell ages ago to tease android launch

Thanks bro!

cute

But they're pretty bad in snake prarie, once the grass is destroyed, they are useless.

Freeze bolt is a terrible idea tbh. The rest are ok though.

Any reasoning behind this? It‚Äôs called Island Invasion because it was supposed to be for duos, where 4 teams spawn around the edges, like they just arrived on boats to invade the island, and the duo in the middle is guarding their territory. (No, it‚Äôs not supposed to be a metaphor or anything)

Yep, its shelly hell

so you want people to be able to play with level 1 brawlers against people that are new?

you want people at 12k trophies with all lvl 1 brawlers to face complete noobs?

yeah sure great idea

Good name

Ohhhhh fuck

Yeah, yes him is name fikupo, mhh k bryan go for it üòà

I love this design, but I'd miss the eagle hat, it's a cool thing for him to have, and we don't need more brawlers to lose their hats

Dont think he should be called "mexican" but good concept

EZ, NIGHT WITCH MORTIS

Quality and quantity are different things. I understood that your problems with Brawl Stars are not mine as well. I have no bugs or I don't care about Trophy Road. The only other thing you talked about, was redesign. You say they are taking too long. SuperCell thinks first about quality (what Brawl Stars has) and redesign are also not very important. Thay want to make the best redesigns as possible. As I said earlier they didn't have all ready for global launch (like other small companies) and that's why they take so long.
---
I your opinion, what should they change in their work and system?

Wow how long have you been
