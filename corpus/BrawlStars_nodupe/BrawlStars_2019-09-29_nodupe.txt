dude your genius. i love it

He did steal it 
---

---
He's back
---
Nice
---
Not near as good as jessie
---
I'm already dead

Oh hahaha! His profile looked really similar to pats

Laughs in Star shelly

#Oh frick my phone have 3% left

#too bad u used 8-bit's second star power
---
You're welcome Brawler!
---
It’s a Jigglypuff seen from above.
---
Just let me shleep
---
Accidentally bought El Rudo Primo. Hated him. Now he's one of my favorites.
---
Well I’ve opened thousands of boxes but I saved up until sandy got released and opened 350+ boxes. I even screen recorded it hoping to get something. My luck sucks lmao
---
#i see american
---
you forgot the lag.
---
u/killerboy99
---
Im a stealer dude
---
I mean, badly written and with one grammar error? Sure. But stroke? Nah, you can easily understand what he means.
---
Yeah i just wrote a random name
---
That guy's acc is #7 years old
---
Oh god this dude have 1 karma and 7 years
---
Or maybe he just throws his bottle around like when he's winning
---
I saw 1 skin of Rosa Cheerleader
---
Honestly though...
---
He can do a magic trick if he's wizard barley
---
Your idea sucked ass. You are just salty “Don’t comment again until you understand- u/YusudTR7 your just saying “If I can’t enjoy legendaries no one at lower trophies can and that is such a dick move. My little brother downloaded to game on global and got 3 leggies I’m happy for him. I got all 3 around a month ago and have been playing since beta. Don’t be an ass
---
I said you’re that not unlucky like me… why you so toxic about that lmoa
---
You play Jessie in big game, don't you ?
---
ME. TOO.
---
Pfff Srbomrzac jadni
---
Not even a bad tilt bro! Only a couple games
---
Kinda True
---
They literally put all the skins i had on sale for really low prices
---
Thats so fucked up for me
---
He has like 500 less trophies than him, I was confused at first but found out a week later
---
Probably
---
Getting to 500 is easy regardless lol. And if you do it all in showdown than you a scrub lol
---
Rush wars is boring af, so no
---
and here I am at 13k complaining about no legendaries while here’s the mad lad with no legendaries, barely any gold, and not even that many star powers with the amount of money that he spent.
---
The people demanding free things are probably trolling
---
???
---
Regarding the legal issues, Fnaf and Brawl stars are totally different games. It would be like putting a Brawler in Smash Bros.
---
What the f-
---
#im probably a troll
---
Dude same here except I have like 19 brawlers
---
I see nothing wrong with this
---
Let’s raid the Vatican!!!
---
*They can’t molest us all*
---
Dude that sums up like basically every short person they can and will destroy you if threatened.
---
Agaist no star power players
---
Well you shouldn’t feel like you’re getting mistreated. Maybe upgrade your brawlers if you want a more “fair” matchup. Once again, matchmaking is based off of trophies, not power levels
---
I’ve faced against star powers and still won with a power one crow
---
Dodges? more like luck
---
Well that certainly happened, big oof to that guy
---
Yes that is why i think they are forcing me to upgrade and matchmaking me to mostly upper hand brawlers. I can consecutively lose 10 games in a row
---
That Atp guy sure must be REALLY bad
---
Sandy is a trap
---
Y’all are forgetting the worst game mode brawl ball. Genuinely pissed they made it permanent. Idk why but I get the worst teammates ever whenever I play. Literally every other game some weeb is running piper and it’s just full of people who have more legendary brawlers the brain cells. The definition of cancer.
---
milk mode
---
you really took the time to switch between colors and navigate the drawing pixel, huh?
---
That’s insane dude!
---
What about your team power?
---
I do say not so nice things to teamers but this is just no words can explain or express what I feel about this
---
 hopefully not
---
Well i mean there is a large difference between a level 1 and level 10. They don’t have levels for no reason at all, you’re kind of supposed to upgrade them. You’re also near 500 trophies so I don’t really know what you’re expecting. There are very little level 1 brawlers that high. If you want a more “fair” match then maybe level the playing field by upgrading your brawlers. If you want the challenge, don’t upgrade them but don’t complain because thats how the system works
---
Its Sandy primo
---
Thank youu! :)
---
Kinda looks like a tamato
---
If you have an offer in the shop that gives more points than you need you get gold back and might even make some gold depending on how many you get and need
---
They have 8.8k lol
---
I'm kind of wondering how you got the grammar wrong
---
Shut up farmer
---
Oddly unsatisfying
---
[deleted]
---
Why do a lot of ppl here seem to have really bad english? My English isn't great either, i'm just curious
---
I know right! Just keep sweating, you'll get there eventually ;)

Nice one

If only it was you doing it

It was lol, check my posts

smol boi

copying this be like
---
Yep
---
well English it's not my first language
---
massive rip
---
You are seriously very lucky. Why does supercell like you players that start up in the game???
---
the calculator doesn't have that many shades of yellow; you just uploaded an image...
---
When a rocket deals less damage than sand.
---
also didn't dodge them all
---
Yeah but they get Sandy so it pays off.
---
Maybe daily challages
---
"i can score it! forget the match i want karma!"

are you trying to flex on us because I'm at 12k with 1 legendary

Uhhhhh.....okay then

More iconic: 
---
*See Jessie*
---
*She sees you*
---
*She spams 3 auto aimed attacks all of which miss by a mile*
---
You want one?
---
Id take one lol
---
Morris if it’s the second. Otherwise tera
---
I got Leon at 2K trophies and haven't gotten another Legendary since then.
---
[Cara Simon's video](https://youtu.be/_ZnNDvHIGS8)
---
I'm aiming for Tick(faster reload), Jessie(heal the turret) and Nita(bear with me) right now. I only have colt and shelly's star powers now. What you upgrade will depend on what you like to use, of course.
---
i keep reading this guys comments in a hippie voice
---
Supercell please buff bibi to reduce the time when attacking as BiBi
---
#what does that mean
---
Money
---
Replays for Bandita Shelly users
---
It looks great!!!
---
But his barley was @600? It's like moaning that the dude who's using one deck in Clash royale isn't good with anything outside of what he chose to play. 
---
The idea (considering overall trophies) is absolutely agreeable. But the guy pushed barley to 600, thus had to beat others the way just you did. So what makes his choice bad? The characters he didn't use. Amazing logic.
---
And while we're at it, what if someone with let's say 15k trophies gets a new brawler? They should they be teamed against other 15k players, otherwise you'd be smurfing low level players just starting out. Same principle, other end of the trophy range.
---
Or you could argue it's rather complicated to include overall trophies when players have huge variations between brawlers due to playstyle. One guy may be great with shotties, so he ranks up the typical "blast your face from 1m" brawlers, but sucks in regards to sharpshooters. 
---
It'd give him an additional disadvantage in learning the latter, since his overall trophies are included as his skill doesn't compete with others using familiar brawlers, like pushing tick after barley.
---
ouch, my guy. cant say how bad i feel. hope you get a leggie soon!
---
nice name lol
---
Didn’t you try to team with them yourself? But still, good job!
---
Even Spike is happy about this
---
r/thebrawlstarscatus
---
I still remember one time when I was disappointed in getting 18 in a brawl box
---
When you see someone with 0 3v3 and 0 Solo and duo victories at 10k
---
Double hmmmm
---
He does it because otherwise he would lose trophies. I’m not condoning teaming or anything, I think it’s absolute shit and hurts the game, but teaming totally isn’t going to stop with just community action. Supercell needs to do more stuff to stop teaming. Yes, they tweaked event modifiers, but that just won’t cut it.
---
Im at 13k trophies and i dont have star shelly :(
---
Poco’s like ‘wow, really?’
---
r/thebrawlstarscactus you spelled “its” name wrong he coming for you
---
More so 2 out of every 10 Shellys, 5 are banditas and 3 are regular Shelly
---
No go. They want people to buy the brawlers. That's why the dropratee are so low. If they give us more brawlers they make less money.
---
Hey catalyst could you explain what those icons across your names symbolizes? Could i get one from some subreddit?
---
Why tf do you have to go straight to being toxic? jesus christ
---
^Oh ^no
---
*horror music starts*
---
Why cant we make tara's super do more damage, it's not like Tara's gonna kill them anyway...
---
I see no bad. Only great drawing :3
---
Didnt laugh
---
*Knock knock knock* you hear the door
---
True

Shit i forgot to say that if you buy a brawler you can get they're raritys too

^help ^me

How many token did you get

I have 3 accounts. I only really play one I haven't touched the other 2 in months 1 is 7k the other is really low.

Hi

No

I mean, they did just give you the win
---
You see something. 2 feet? They are green you hear an unzipping noise. “I know where you are. Just come out now” It whispers
---
They are just a flair you can get one by tapping the 3 dots you see in the top right corner.

I get 40 minimun but rarely, usually 50+ and likely 80+. Maxed f2p

put one asterisk on each side of the text for *italics*, 2 for **bold**

Man I understand that bushes can make a map look pretty but if it has majority of the area covered in bushes it's just gonna end up like eye of the storm map

This is from lwarb beta.

What about ending the game in the air after being caught in a Tara Super

But not arm days...

Yeah so she can stay in the "pirate rank" boi

oh okay thx for the answer

Anybody think it would.be the coolest thing to have a map designer in game and be able to play customs w it? Like u can save maps and play w ur friends on maps u made

Yes m8

But then I get more skins and progress and then I don't get that legy which is the main reason I opened the account for

You have a point 😂

Yup. I've seen the movie... Over And Over Again

Why Russian community is so stupid? Why do you found this perfect place where I can't see БЛЭТ every second. I know, you don't undestand me because you stupid asshole who make a posts on russian. Ok. Почеиу русское комьните такое тупое? Почему вы наши этот райский уголок где нет БЛЭТов и прочьего шлака. Нахуя делать пост на русском в АНГЛИЙСКОМ РЕДДИТЕ!? В правмлах блять написано, пост не на английском - бан. Уйди и НИКОГДА не возвращайся сюда, ебанный аутист.

I got 2 legendaries :)

See you in hot

Omg so unlucky :(
---
I just did that and I got spike
---
Your god damn stupid and attackimg a straw man here.
---
The reason I talked about rarity was as means to show how stupid your statement was.

But hey, keep crying for free legendaries. Anything else you want for free for your shortcomings?

---
I need to correct my r/engrish
---
Feels bad man, but hey you may be the unluckiest now but you have a higher chance of unlocking multiple legendaries from a same box or atleast back to back so you will soon become the luckiest :D

its a good idea

nice m8

why tf did you guys downvoted his comment? XD

Agree

You can’t see if i’m happy (:

Nice👍

I'm just saying that you guys are arguing over a game that's why both of you are Cry Babies
---
He has eaten them
---
love.it.!

Agreed I don't see any teaming in Feast or Famine. Healing Mushroom is very good too, when everyone teams you can just go to the gas and have many healing mushrooms. Lol

I think my account is 100€ worth at this moment (in some years maybe 400€)

That guy is hiding on some alt account. Probably OP's older brother or whatever. Very weird how hard he is trying to defend OP.

17 is too much, put 11

Yes ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Somebody still plays Pvz Heroes? C'mon, EA forgot about it...
---
Yes its polish
---
I hope he learned his lesson
---
Where did you find this
---
On my 11k account I have 2 legendaries. And I decided to create a new one... and I dropped Sandy
---
Ending the game as scrappy
---
Guys just stop what you guys doing is just meaning less
---
Every dynamike gangsta until they see mortis with coiled snake
---
She could be the end of the trophy road skin

Thats actually creative. Actually, let me correct it : ANY IDEA I THE GAME WOULD BE GOOD AT THIS POINT ! Seriously, i'm a beta player and i'm simply bored.
---
Dude, is English community

What about a button for stopping the Scrappy when inside a bush? That way, teamers can't just turn it off, but people in bushes can.

Ok, this is epic

I was hungry

***F***

I have 3 legendaries with a current 0.1711%. I have no clue what you're trying to yet at with this dumb straw man.

Get a life, alt account.

Wow!

U are a mortis u should only eat dynamikes

you could say he is a dashing goalkeeper
---
Thank you :3

Soon :)

Soon ;)

did he also camp during your round? I hate campers in duo.. if you wanna camp, go play solo, don't ruin the fun for everyone else who actually wants to play.
---
Thank you ♥️
---
😂
---
Thank you)
---
Thank you!
---
In gem mortis can't carry gem....he must push the enemy and he must avoid them to reach center. Gem can carry only the gem carrier, who must help mortis in his attack
---
He keep it in his mouth

#Thanks

That's exactly what I am doing. My Shelly, Bull, Crow, Primo, Darryl are at around 600. Working on Bo to get to 600.

Quick question. I'm fairly new to the whole reddit scene. How do you get that "Poco" next to your name?
---
Repost 👎
---
Is this your contribution to the fanart? That's great!
---
I just want to say all the problems you guys are saying can be solved if the turret would not shooting if you can see the brawler like in a bush , invisible leon or sandy with super
---
mortis: hey fellow mortis why you are old and have a dynamite instead of a shovel?
---
Aww dude that's rough! May nita players be blessed with some buffs of any kind!
---
Like frick

Go to r/brawlstars and in the top right corner there are 3 dots, click on that and you can choose user flairs
---
Why does this exist? I’ll never know. Here’s your upvote
---
YES YES YES. YES YES IMA READ IT IN THE EVENING
---
just so it's like doesn't mean there cannot be wild west stuff in the game
---
Thank you kind stranger
---
Soo true, l didn't liked that skin  at all, but when l heard that it would be more expensive l bought it XD
---
Except I didn’t lose because I’m shiba nita and shiba Nita never losses!
---
I live for the catharcism of denying the cocky ones a win!
---
Darryl and Crow should be a meme format (Darryl with Crows face)
---
i don't think it's a good idea, maybe extra tokens per kill would be better
---
This is bad especially for short range brawlers like bull and primo
---
*userflairdoesnotcheckout*
---
Well i had nothing better to do......
---
Hahaha too true! With something that cute, the universe needs to let you win!
---
3 colt wins for 5 power points? That's so bad
---
Waiting :D

What if Tick uses his super? 
---
Kamikaze Scrappy

\*Gotta be 'dick' in there somewhere.\*

I like how invisible leon over here

Si sono io

I've felt this way since 3k and I'm just at a measly 7k now.
---
Okay that was epic!
---
Friendly reminder: 1000K = 1 million. You probably mean 100 million.
---
Yes, this skin only for players who play BS before 2019. I also got this skin
---
Jeez, chill. The game mode is new and definitely needs some things to fix, so it’s natural that it’s shit. Just wait and see what happens, and then we can full-on say it’s shit when we’re not happy with the changes they make.

I spent half an hour naming every one of them

i think it should be mythic because there is only 3

Saying what. You guys comment your trophies and the brawlers you are missing as if someone asked you or someone cares. So many people comment that, that literally no one gonna give a penny about your status. Not trynna insult you but it's the truth.

This post is old as frick i have 3,3k upvotes dont worry go do something else bye

all those are possible when you labor on a love, but if none, nothing wasted too

---
Better start crying
---
Wow just wow
---
Dang that’s insane but colt and elprimo is a abomination
---
I’m sorry, isn’t anyone gonna talk about the eyebrows.😂😂😂
---
Cringe e non fa più ridere (parlo di Bassano)
---
Smart move, personally I like the tick and 8-but combo
---
Like me
---
It's hurting my eyes ;-;
---
You’ve made my day 100x better. This is so amazing! Piper with Bibi’s face looks awesome. Thanks for this!
---
in this mode you must reach the escape zone (star logo at the corner of the map), robots and brawlers with and without star powers will come on your way to escape zone in this mode, the match will end when you and your teammates die the respawn time is 10 seconds
---
That was my original plan then i realized you can fuse 3 or more brawlers together.
---
The fusion post to end all fusion posts.
---
Hey guys, just because there's an Italian word doesn't mean you have to speak Italian.
---
Wow. Just wow. Well done!
---
SPIKE FACES R CREEPY
---

---
Stfu
---
OH SHIT WE FOGOT ABOUT 3 COMBOS

#High Effort Meme
---
Great job buddy 👍
---
That image is so high res my phone can't even open it.
---
I still think it's beautiful
---
It is never going to get into the game, the servers arent actually working for beta
---
Same here smh
---
-And the brawlers fusion ends here-
---
That's too much.
---
You're welcome, I love making people happy.
---
Lol
---
This one useless post can end all other fusions post on this sub.
---
This is Bulls Star Power from the leak. This is fake
---
Crows head is extra cursed. I love it! Great job OP
---
Yeah me too.
---
Can you please stop with these low effort meme?
---
Very well done &amp; high effort! Take my upvote :)
---
8-Bit family taking over shelly family HOT
---
We need more characters to put ticks face on. I need more
---
I love the effort you put and I dont wanna sound against your statement, but just want to know how are there 812 possible? Shouldnt it be half of that? I can finally sleep once i know how xD
---
I like how colt and poco are shocked
---
ok
---
When the rhe image dose not load hmmmm
---
What is this?
---
"I'm just op for fun"
---
What do you think about this new game mode?
---
Solid!
---
**AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!**
---
Wow man its awesome.
---
Nice effort nice editing.
---
Keep it up.
---
If you like to play jessi and brok, yes

Welcome

#did i just get a second compliment 0f how awsome my p0st wes
---
The brawlers with spike faces... Oh the irony!
---
So this is the LAST fusion I will ever upvote
---
mortis and crow look pretty cool
---
Penny fusions are genuinely twisted
---
Nice.
---
especially liking crow+8-bit and darryl+leon
---
No it won't get unnoticed
---
Perfect.
---
You are an absolute legend. Wow
---
You deserve a veterans discount
---
Thank you for ending the karma farm.
---
Sandy face is straight up ahegao (probably misspelled that)

#MAMMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
OMG that would be so cool!
---
This the worst meme I’ve seen all day
---
Happy cake day !
---
now let's start with 3 brawlers eh?
---
Haha nice work dude.
---
hope you didnt start to cry yet
---
You had to make it during the full release date and January
---
"Aww sweety!"
---
Probably playing since April or something. If you are a beta player you probably stopped playing for a very long time or you don't play almost at all.
---
Would you wait 8 seconds to get 4 ammo?
---
Incendiary is constant and rocket no.4 isn’t
---
I have explained this multiple times and I am going to do it again,If Supercell adds a report button,people would spam reports for no reason.Even if you limit it 3 per day,there will still be fake reports. There will also be hundreds or thousands of reports,And Supercell is just a small team of developers
---
Yeah because everybody stands still while you aim at them
---
Thanks!!
---
Bruh, that’s not true, if you have a sp, you’re most likely in the 600-700 range, nobody would just stand still unless they’re throwing
---
It’s been, a few months that you’ve played
---
Next update
---
Steel hoops still better
---
But nice idea
---
Dude endgame starts when actual decent trophy road rewards end. (10k) Literally nobody is at 20k
---
Hahah this is epic. Nice hosting job
---
These 5 items remaining memes are so overused
---
Lol, I'm crying tear of joy
---
Can you try put a loaded rico in there as well?
---
The 5 items remaining posts are overused
---
meme rewiew
---
happy to hear that.
---
I think it's the highest number of upvotes I ever saw in this subreddit
---
noone enjoys it
---
yes
---
Oops hah can’t math
---
No worries, recognizing what you could do better is the first step to improvement. Good luck.
---
I glad there’s another person in this sub who’s seen La Bohem.
---
lol wtf how can’t you... omg I can kill sandy so easily it’s not even op it’s pretty terrible if you ask me.
---
People are probably gonna "Share" this.Pretty much take this and say This is really cool or something like that,somebody is gonna say "This isn't yours".They are gonna reply "I didn't say it was mine"
---
Well at least my giant fusion post can end all other fusion post from now on
---
May be the player who score his own goal twice accidentally or intentionally should get -15 trophies instead of regular trophy deduction after the match end.
---
It's very unlikely for the same player to score his own goal twice by accident and if he did he deserves that punishment for being so bad at the game lol and I'm sure the other two teammates would feel the same way.
---
Also I think this will cause people that want to troll to think twice hopefully.
---
why thank you good sir
---
Adidas Russian leon
---
My little cousin after watching WWE
---
Accurate
---
So many brawlers could negate those walls
---
non mene aspettavo così tanti
---
But is a joke about fusioned brawlers and that ok the first second third time but now its anoying i am searching for interesting post not overused jokes
---
And after that i Found out i can just open the unloaded image in a New tab and see it, FUCK me
---
No, because I don't have that skin myself.
---
Hair
---
Great idea!
---
Well, a lot of people are saying this is a repost, but i didn't intend it, because i just tought of this, but with a community of 230K members It's no surprise someone made it before.
---
I feel like the only reason you hear about it a ton is because the people that don’t have leggies at that range complain about it a ton while the people that do don’t say anything about it, which makes it seem like more people don’t have leggies
---
thanks
---
Use incognito to view hot. I don't think it's there anymore?
---
Also, between my first comment and now, the post had 5.0K upvotes, but it hasn't increased since then...
---
Good luck dude hope u will get ur fav legy soon
---
I hope you are joking
---
It time to LETS GET THIS PARTY STARTED
---
r/cursedbrawlstars
---
This is Way too high effort for a brawler fusion post, pls my eyes are burning
---
I’m at 6.8k and there’s 18 brawlers that I could upgrade rn but I have almost no gold. And then there’s a few that I can get up 2-3 power levels
---
That happens to me often
---
Use gems for coins isn't bad. Buy Power points for  coins is bad
---

---
#laughs in rank 20 Mortis at Level 1
---
Let's go hu.. wait i'm an 8-bit now and throwers counter me :*(
---
Wow! Very nice yet again. Just missed the band aid. Looking forward to more brawl stars cosplays. Made piper or Jesse? Keep up the great work.
---
oh, ok... I thinked you are crazy.
---
Love it
---
I'm sorry my mistake. This is not about Lwarb Legacy, but Lwarb Mods
---
Let’s downvote this
---
Let's go duo mode my friend

Oh...

Need some balancing

Ok but how the fuck does that thing stay on your head?

Especially on Sandy

That's some boxes you have there. Wish I had so many. Nice that you got leon.

This is a great cosplay! I loved your penny one. Just a quick question- why do you look sad? You look dissapointed for some reason. Looking forward to a future cosplay soon! (Maybe Piper? :)

it's all good

It is probably a third star power

Because the bot deletes messages I will send it to you in a private chat.

No, POP/STAR

Undertale reference?
---
I'm just going to wait and see what yall think about this
---
What's the point of power points if you can't power up anything?
---
Not funny
---
it\`s sad that this is the most upvoted post on my account
---
Maybe trophie road sould end at like 20k so there would be this skin but a lot less
---
100 million and not 1000k
---
You should expect your next legendary in October of 2023
---
I needed this, thanks
---
What is OCD?
---
Why is it bad? I only focus and play a select few brawlers so doing just chests means nothing to me
---
I'm sorry, but guns at 15 are illegal 😂
---
Checked your previous posts. You play the victim card? For real? Posting low effort posts all the way I see.
---
That's not Leon cos I still see him
---
That’s a little too soon, isn’t it?
---
No. This would eliminate any incentive to level up brawlers. It’s a little weird that you’re still seeing power 10 8 bits at that rank.
---
3/10 for this tierlists.all the brawl talk and updates are cool!
---
No 1500 is about right
---
I’m assuming a f2p could save enough gems to buy one by then. But otherwise, yeah, probably
---
You already posted this
---
Well, i Just got 25 of Sandy in a brawl box...
---
.........
---
maybe for you....
---
BIBI-BROCK
---
PIPER-DYNA
---
Surely by now you will have gained a layer of tolerance for those kind of posts, judging how long you’ve been here.
---
I think It decreases about of 0,05%
---
Haha boobies so funny haha😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😅🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
---
Most I get is 10 or 5 for him
---
That’s definitely not what OCD is.
---
It's literally cheating
---
I've had 22 lol it just feels bad after the first 12 tbh
---
Thanks
---
What do you think about brawlers fusion then ??
---
Oh, that loss ...
---
It went all the way up to 25
---
ok bud, take your opinion
---
I prefer Kirby you miscreant bat-winged bastard
---
RealCanadian_ let me repost it
---
You just dont understand the the title
---
Dirty
---
Feels bad man
---
Shocky its too op
---
It's free stuff 
---
Supercell is money hungry
---
They wont do this
---
I think you should play...Hay Day
---
Oh sorry the other people in the comments saying that mortis is literally a legendary killed my braincells
---
Sandy looks kinda... uhh...
---
I also got him 
---
At 12k
---
Yes he is! I think he is way better than bull and shelly
---
post this on r/lootstars
---
Why thank you
---
I must burn you alive for your crimes
---
I just need coins, sandy and star powers. I usually just get coins from boxes. Feels kinda worthless opening them
---
Rico you know what would make my day? GIVE ME ALL DOSE GEMS
---
I was sad but now I’m smiling. Thank you!
---
Dont uninstall
---
Why oh why did this made me laugh this much, nice one op!
---
At 10k ? Push to 12k at least boy
---
More like mercs never dies (because of Medic in TF2)
---
Ps: i'm not the the Piper xD
---
Im close to getting enough power points for level 8 colt and i barely have enough for it so.

my first 500 was bull, ofc it was before the trophy buff and i mustve played with him like 10 hrs at least
---
I like ur editing
---
O god why! Send the nukes please
---
God damn, the 2 Post before this Post were Themed about this too...
---
But hey, at least the last one was a complain.
---
Answer my question. Why do you steal posts. Don't you have a life?
---
Dammit shelly!
---
I like the edits
---
Colt super?
---
FIGHT!
---
CONQUER!
---
Considering The things I have done, indeed, i have no life. Why I steal posts? Because I can.
---
Yeah, my personal record so far.
---
Supercell should do that if the last player who took the ball is, for example, from the blue team and the ball enters the goal of the blue team simply will not count as a goal
---
This is so sad.
---
Alexa can we play Despacito 2 on this one.
---
8K
---
My most rare brawler is frank

Haha gotcha

the sound the rockets make when they explode

 The meme did not last a week, the same happened with the mergers of brawlers

Y’all look like y’all speaking Chinese American
---
u/SpicyChickenCrow 
---
Take a look at this pathetic guy's account.
---
And they’re normal. Idk why they exaggerate it, and it gets such insanely upvoted
---
Ever played bounty
---
feel free to suggest on how to improve it ;)
---
How many posts about me?
---
Removed - You have a negative karma score, please fix this before posting again. This action is to prevent spam on the subreddit.
---
Shitty person, shitty logic. Grow up.
---
Till you get banned
---
Ok that was cool
---
yes but this one has no star and every kill gives you one point instead of 2 tried to not make it like bounty by giving it a longer time and 1 point for kill another difference is that you don't have stars or points on top of your brawler so for every kill you will not get or lose more than 1 point for your team
---
aww dudes tnx
---
I subscribed to one but only because I liked the content.
---
Im gonna get banned, yes, but that wont stop me from making alts and stealing *your* posts again
---
Maybe you didn’t pray to the god emperor enough...
---
Reposting is pretty shitty but as far as I know it isn’t against site rules.
---
If you want him banned talk to r/brawlstars mods. Don’t fucking harass this dude tho
---
First time editing a meme so mind the flaws
---
Well u can use any star powers u want in friendlies, and nobodys used those outside of friendlies if they dont have them, i doubt SC is worried about being hacked as the reason for that
---
Removed. Rule 3. No providing information on how to break Supercell Terms of Service.
---
Yeah, and they exaggerate it. Honesty, how many times do you NOT get 5 remaining? Probably never! So why are they making such a big deal about it? It’s frustrating for me to see these posts
---
How about this name:One last hug
---
Dang
---
I got pams turret aswell, with her starpower she does 200 damage at enemies.
---
That was fast
---
THE PASSION THAT SHATTERED PINK DIAMOND!
---
Scrappy lmao
---
Probably something like “they both won wOoSh”
---
This "dude" is stealing everything from everyone and he said he will continue doing it. What do you mean don't harass this dude? I'll take it to the end, till he get banned. Please give me a favour and report him. Reposting is bad and should be punished.
---
Mama’s Climax
---
That battle was totally epic.
---
But, I mean, Supercell gave it for a reason
---
That would come in clutch during sd matches
---
got crow.
---
Supercell actually already have a system for these trolls, he is probably banned right now, i have read before on reddit on someone's post that SC have a system to ban them, Kairos have said it and Frank have said it somewhere, will try to find and link the post, https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/an83ra/i_cant_report_this_scumbag_so_im_just_gonna/efstcpi?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Edit: linked to the comment.
---
What if your brawler had less than 400 trophies?
---
not an edit. It's real lol
---
wait where is nit-
---
Haha I got Shelly!!!
---
Our club president did the same thing
---
Man the idea was good it’s even in brawl stars! Wow this is the first time supercell took a fan skin and put in the game!
---
The apostrophe in dynamikes is the icing on the cake
---
Solid 8/10
---
What is that title
---
Coach Cory better give the same
---
I once saw a post about it, Google it and maybe you'll find the post
---
Time to kill that with a mouse bot
---
What is this? eye of the storm
---
The tables have turned my friends
---
Star Shelly is rarer than all of the legendary brawlers because no one can get it anymore
---
I don't know if this is r/brawlrecruit or r/shittybrawlstars
---
r/lootstars
---
I still miss 3 legendaries and im at 0,2565% is that ok for you?
---
He looks like pewdewpie’s cringy brother
---
I couldn't find his health anywhere can you tell me what it is
---
I like this guy
---
*begins to sweat uncontrollably*
---
Why here?
---
Idk but why they hate emoji police
---
I have sandy on 750 and i think he's op against the right enemies, but can easily get killed by others, yesterday i played a few matches brawl ball, and whenever there was a mortis, he had coiled snake, and dashed into me and then made the other dashes and killed me, while i could just hit 2-3 times and didn't kill him, so the mortis always hunted me down whenever i respawned (my team mates didn't really care) and i coulden't get to their goal, except if i used my super, but i need it when i'm at their goal for my team to have an advantage, so i coulden't make anything in those games with an enemy mortis
---
Stop shaking your screen I'm literally going to throw up my eyeballs. Otherwise, 5/10, not really impressive, just a satisfying moment.
---
Yo can you email me the psd file for that?
---
nice man, what power lvl did u have him when u got him to 500? :)
---
YEA this is funny but also you are teaming!!!!
---
Were you the leader of the team
---
This can work with the automatic changing feature in iOS/android (not sure if its on android) when the sun rises, it's light mode and the sun sets its dark mode.
---
I got penny, I’m dead lol
---
Piper that’s an easy win
---
Got leon
---
it's sad but it will be better to just way for a good offer and buy the legendaries rather to just wait probably months to get 1 and get your legendary chance to drop, so you have to wait even more than before to get another one.
---
Really?
---
This is so cool, I need this in the game NOW
---
It's not a glitch you dumbass, it's made so your ass won't infinitely roll on water and make him unbalanced

Can someone explain the meaning of those Memes ? I honestly don’t understand what they’re implying
---
Crow looks weird
---
MORTIS! Bringer of doom!
---
maybe it can be a shadow tara that copies exactly what you do. So your new skin would still be visible.
---
See you in his next review
---
Not really, the way that your phone works with internet is that it runs everything first from video then till play. It builds an oval like shape in which you can move last, as for it is the toughest part to do.
---
Make a 2nd account and do it with Jessie
---
Cries in wasted 1500 star points
---
Cool dude
---
Got Mortis
---
How come you can use emojis while us cant use emojis without getting downvoted?
---
Both your ideas would make a fun and balanced star power
---
Got Leon, guess I can NIGERUNDAYO
---
Tara
---
I got gene at 1.6k 1 day after gene cane out and crow 1 day later but that like 7 or 8 months ago and now i still dont have another legendary and now i'm 12k

It increases every 40 draws

Welp I have 20 to upgrade at 15k

Well spike used to counter bull

Duplicate brawlers anyone?

Hmmm yes the hand hand here is made out of hand
---
Epic

I'd buy that for 300 gems

the fact he missed is worse
