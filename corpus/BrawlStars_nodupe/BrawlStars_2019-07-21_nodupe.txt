What major billion dollar company does donations, they would get a ton of backlash from adding ads due to them never doing it before and with all the monetization and shit happening in gaming period(2k, EA, etc)  ‚Äúsponsorships‚Äù don‚Äôt work like that. You have investors. And they want to see there getting there money‚Äôs worth so you need to pay them back. Esports is probably coming soon but the game is too lackluster(not enough options) at the moment. Maybe when 3 man showdown comes its a option.

perfectly balanced as all things should be

Well, thanks for the feedback! I tried arranging the emotes on the screen in a way so it won't interfere with the player.
---
how am i supposed to use Discord with randoms?? if you have a team of friends of course the best is to use discord, but with randoms its better to ude emotes or commands. i suggested emotes, because its more fun (not really annoying at least for majority of people) and its easier to understand picture with corner of your eye than read a text mid-battle. also supercell would make money because the ‚Äúcommands‚Äù could be bought (for example celebrating etc)
---
i agree with you, Supercel's opinion is changing, but isn't enough. They said that with new stuff like meteor shower the teaming will decrease, but meteor shower increase the teaming, only healing decrease a bit the teaming.
---
Yes, you could, just like in Clash Royale

What did it come out to? Level 8 Gene btw

Also, at some point, I stopped attacking the boss bot and started charging my ult off some of the mouse bots, so the boss bot health is really only a lower bound for how much damage I did. ü§î
---
Wow, you really want see Shelly get nerfed to the ground aren't you?
---
It wouldn't necessarily be for a new skin it just happened to be robo spike in the example. Plus it wouldn't be big discount maybe only 10 gems off but a small discount on 1 skin a day would probably help a bit in encouraging people to buy.

Do I count leap days?

Somehow this make me feel comfortable

You would be correct! Though I did stop using it at some point and decided to kill the mouse bots instead out of convenience.

An upvote is all i can do for all the valuable time you wasted in making this lmao

Judging from his profile that seems to be exactly what he plans
---
After 2k on trophy road,  the rewards are frankly insulting.  
---
Should be no gold prize less than 150
---
Should be no power point prize less than 150
---
Should be no boxes smaller than a big brawl box(and after 3-4k should only be mega boxes)

If you're talking about sd then I can't tell how many times I've killed shellys using even tick.
---
 Only maps Shelly was good were grassy maps, in other maps she'd get bullied easily cuz even if can't kill the Shelly (using a low dmg brawler) I can push her into someone and pinch her.
---
I've defeated full health shellys even with mortis (there boxes near) and few other times with primo when I dodge her super or get my super faster (or just wait till she wastes ammo) 
---
The reason there were that many shellys is bc noobs would main her so bad (like having a 500+ shelly and the other brawlers at 100-300

A server that is a premium server with other premium attributes. Try looking at history. Everquest 1, in the easiest days of MMO‚Äôs, achieved it with success and supercell will as well. It has nothing to do with a good or bad player you feeble minded idiot. It has to do with a premium service that would likely prevent most of the stupidity you see happening daily. That is, if you see the stupidity at all. I‚Äôm quite sure you are part of the stupidity so you wouldn‚Äôt notice it. People will not pay a mo they subscription to this game to simply lose to others. If they did, supercell (tencent) would still be profiting immensely. Clearly you do not understand revenue stream. That‚Äôs your lesson for today.

For El primo can be Trohr or Incineroar too
---
This is my point exactly. Are you surprised that a map requiring cooperative play would be any different? Either give us more solo maps or fix your bullshit supercell. It isn‚Äôt this difficult.
---
Thank you! Someone actually suggested from IG that "decomposition" would be a good star power. Grass grows where the brawler she hit died. More hiding spots :D

I agree. Every time I see Tick, I know I am going to have a frustrating and boring game. His range is too long. He just slows down the game. If you step on his mines, you lose health. If you wait for mines to explode, you lose time, and by the time they all explode, he already three new mines

I think gedikor did this but oke den
---
Just pushed Jessie in Solo SD, she‚Äôs weak but still pushable
---
Holy heck bro! Why did I get so many downvotes
---
An Interesting Reply
---
So I've been trying to get all my brawler to rank 20/500 trophies and on average before it was time to play Jessie I would get to rank 20 In about   2 days of off and on casual play.  
---
Now with this damn bitch it has taken me almost a week to get her to rank 20. Jesus Christ it takes her forever to kill power up boxes in show down. I'm actually playing brawl stars less because I hate playing her. That said i am almost done...rank 18... Not much to go now.
---
You wrote it in turkish. Neden
---
Supercell can fix it, with make even smallest hitbox

Ok...?

Star power Leon at 400 some trophies yet only has 2.3 k total for the whole account wtf is happening here
---
Even if Rosa wasn't nerfed to the ground, Shelly's super would chain with one shot.
---
That's cool, source?
---
and piper supers hates me
---
He is MO
---
Are you f2p?
---
Time to get constructive !
---
I hope not
---
no he is the imposter! i‚Äôm the real Colt.
---
Yeah that's sounds right, but she still useful imo, maybe her new star power help her shine again in these modes
---
Ok
---
Hehe
---
ouch
---
H E H E
---
So true
---
Actually gold is made of yellow, brown and sparkling effects
---
I feel lucky then.
---
thanks, I'll look into that app. I had no problems pushing dynamike, and very little problems with barley, so I don't know why tick is being such an issue
---
Bibi has thicc tits
---
He's God because he got that
---
Ah, guess they set that as a blanket amount of time to guarantee that games don't last too long. Still not sure why that time specifically, since it doesn't seem to have any significance (794 isn't some special number in computer science).
---
Most ive got is 10
---
r/cursedbrawlstars
---
Yeah that sounds good
---
I agree 
---
Its been not even few months of that meme and its already overused in  this sub lmao

The power of this subreddit is quite surprising....

I see a house without front walls

I got Leon at 100ish trophies because I spent money. Who cares?
---
Congrats!
---
I looked it up and the first thing to pop up was ‚ÄúGold, also called golden, is a yellow-orange color which is a representation of the color of the element gold.‚Äù And colors don‚Äôt sparkle
---
There's a Jessie called Mia Khalifa....
---
r/brawlstarsp: It's free real estate
---
Don't worry it will get better
---
i know, but what i want to say, is that rosa only win shelly(with super, also without, depends of the player) when she was the most op bralwers in the game.
---
World record
---
Perhaps that would be acceptable. She is no doubt a complete monster in an open area with max range. That can not be made stronger or she will be broken. Her biggest weakness is someone getting up close to her. No matter what brawler it is, up close I'm pretty sure she loses every encounter with her main attack. HOWEVER this weakness is no longer existent when her super is charged up, because it makes getting close to her pointless and dangerous. So I don't know if it needs a change. Maybe make her super do more damage so she still has the weakness up close normally?

Oh f**k thanx for remindin though

My only prized possesion is both starpowers 500 spike
---
Worst meme
---
He's saying but the word "would" before "definitely" and then it's a perfect English sentence
---
What's the penalty
---
I didn't know you could get 500 gems .
---
I've got 14000 and can say she isn't because of the tank meta. I thought the same at your range, but like most bad Brawlers at this point, they aren't bad mechanic-wise, but just bad in the meta.
---
I mean gold isn't a color technically 
---
Its a thing/element
---
I've got a 576 trophy and star power leon
---
For brawl ball: Similar concepts but lanes aren‚Äôt as important. People clump more so having Tara and Rico are great. Having someone who can destroy the wall in front of goal is a necessity: Frank, Shelly, Colt, Primo. And bibi is amazing for her knockback. Less defined rolls, so more combinations are available.
---
For heist, very map dependent, but having a shotgunner (bull or Darryl), a thrower, and a long range control (like Brock or rico) is very effective.
---
LOL I just realized
---
i know gedi kor, yes
---
Np man
---
what a lovely place
---
It could be "a Crow". Same way I could say damn I'd love to pull a Spike or a Leon or a Pam or a Frank.
---
Sounds better without "a" but it's still proper English
---
Insert Piano Man

haha! This us amazing!

Hi

U cant even make normal screenshot and change your profile icon ü§£

Gold is a colorüòÇüòÇüòÇ it‚Äôs a color based of the element

Got em all before 1k because I spend money like an adult.

---
Thank You!
---
damn those are big maracas
---
Lmao
---
She is the source. She‚Äôs an artist/cosplayer
---
I have all Brawlers maxxed so what's the point? I open them when a new brawler comes out so I can max them.
---
Pussy
---
I've tried it out and I really like it. Its so good. I've been winning a bunch of matches thanks to it.
---
Please stop with Pokemon, this is r/brawlstars

Thank You, I'm really happy :)

Nice!

i just don‚Äôt read the comments on every video lmao. and if people aren‚Äôt allowed to post something just because it exists on a completely different platform, this website would really suck.
---
Like you redeem the points and then open another box and got a new Brawler? That's just lucky that it happened that way
---
Wow my spike is 565
---
He‚Äôs talking about the image OP posted, the guy is only at 2k thropy.

Can someone put the old system of trophies here to compare ?

Um.. i seriously have no idea who he is :(

They have negative gems?

Jasper and amethyst*
---
Ok now this is very intriguing, what makes you ship them? I‚Äôm legit curious
---
Colt's skins are just him with black hair
---
Read Floral Shoppe the moment I glanced at this.
---
Exactly. People who do it know they‚Äôll get hate and attention. Just don‚Äôt expose them
---
Honestly Piper is super good in open maps on solo showdown, but I don‚Äôt know about higher trophy levels. I really got trophies up to like 250 by showdown with her
---
Most I‚Äôve gotten is 13
---
Jessie op

That's some cute shit right there

No i'm the real colt! Shoot him!

Bruhhhh this is so fkin cool.

It is exactly 13min 10sec
---
franku loves young vodys
---
13min 10 sec, I know
---
Welp.
---
For a pay to play yes, but mid-to late game they are very valuable since upgrade costs are very high.
---
Never understood ppl that play short range brawlers in a long range map
---
Cut off 4 seconds, it is 13 min 10sec
---
Karma farming in disguise
---
It is 13m 10s, I tried it. So cut off 4 sec
---
Wham bam, here comes FBI

Sure! :)
---
Yeah... The enemy Carl's gonna have fun playing in this map.
---
Thank you!^^
---
What have you done. Now every gang is going to start posting propaganda like crazy üò®
---
Supercell Logic:Animals can have voices(Crow).But plants can't.
---
It's their new star powers 
---
Bull's is tough guy which reduces  30% damage when he falls under 40% health 
---
Shelly's is band aid which heals her to full immediately when she falls under 40% health and takes 20 seconds to recharge
---
They are so many idk were to spend them on
---
it‚Äôs a lil magical thing called starpowers
---
That is a huge buff
---
Great and underrated map
---
Pos 'ora ya sabes C:
---
Ok here we go to calculate and put math in brawl stars
---
900(Lvl1 Dmg) x 1.125(12.5% buff)=1012.5
---
Lvl 1 Mortis Post Buff=1012 (let‚Äôs round it to 1010)Dmg
---
Multiply that by 1.40(Difference between lvl 1 and max is 40%)And you have a maxed mortis will deal 
---
1,414 damage in a single swing
---
Double checking(Current Mortis Max DMG=1,280 x 1..125= 1440) &lt;‚Äî Close enough
---
Conclusion:it‚Äôs a noticeable buff
---
Get #bamboozled
---
What happened?

You‚Äôre embarrassing yourself
---
This is not reason to call jessie the worst character 
---
You can't imagine how she op on heist
---
I dont know, I pushed jessie to 500 in showdown. Jessie is really good in duo showdown as her orbs can just pass to each teammate or if the enemy is close to a box then you can hit the box and make the enemy brawler take damage. It might not be her best mode but she is good in it
---
new star powers, band aid and tough guy

[Here's a real hack for you guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

#GET OVER HERE!!!

Thanks guys! I had no idea!

And after youre the stupid player that don t team and youll die.What and idea...

No lewding allowed

I must be saw that girl cosplayed bibi ü§î

R.I.P u/phlorpe (not himself, his reddit account)

You've met some maxed brawlers my.friend, Bull's shield comes from his Tough Guy star power, and Shelly gets her healing from her Band-Aid star power
---
Why you dont play showdown?
---
Luck all time
---
please say sike before you get downvoted to hell
---
wdym?

I said, you are acting like you dont know if it was done already. Stop acting stupid
---
That was good

That Leon...

I'm sorry comrade, but I cannot be a vodka bot

all morti who dont go their way to say "lol powercube" on a comment just bc they have a thrower flair are more tham welcome

y not

-1280 gems...
---
bull beats darryl in every stat even tho hes one of the first trophy road brawlers, and darryl is a rare (or super rare i can't remeber) even if darryl is higher in rank, please raise awareness, i don't team unless i see a bull and or shelly
---
What map is that

Those skins are just for p2w players like you .

Luchy big box

How do you get the Leon icon?
---
This is fucking hilarious
---
I‚Äôm not in low trophies buddy.. and she is OP
---
That‚Äôs how people get free stuff in the game. Buy it and then get refunded; you keep the stuff but get negative gems. Gamer fraud....
---
If you are in the left it doesnt work.
---
a helmet could be a good hat replacement, maybe?
---
This made me laugh
---
It works in matches well so
---
Well no but actually no
---
I don‚Äôt know if this is stupid but I actually bought most of the epic brawlers and gene before I did my box opening, hoping to keep the % for legendaries and it kinda worked ..(got2/3 and all mythical now
---
Exactly. He thinks a report system would be easy, but he doesn‚Äôt realize that the devs are a small team of around 20 people and that it‚Äôd either be abused or the massive influx of reports would take the devs too much time to sort through. I agree that a report button or system of reporting game throwing is necessary, but it‚Äôs not as easy as it sounds.

Also you forgot about: ##TIME TO TAKE CARE OF THE WEEDS

My highest was 13k I have no legendaries bad no mortis but yet you at 2.3k have Leon I mean good for you but I'm pissed supercell!!!!

Im 15

I appreciate all Randoms which don't die 3 Seconds before the match ends, and the ones which don't screw everything up by walking into a wall all the time.

Awesome!

No he fell into the hands of the boss robot and his brain was put in robomike but his bird took the opportunity to take out his brain and took over.

It's impossible that supercell allows that. BS is a very child friendly game after all

Man, please don't consider other people's work at yours. This skin concept was made by another artist, not by you. and you even censored the credits and put your name on it. That's not a good thing. Everyone knows YOU sealed this, stop acting like it's yours please

Definitely not lying

we have that one place with the piano thats slightly elevated, but theres enough space for other instruments

Sounds very scary

Upvote and comment "k" 5 times to see magic

I'm playing since launch and I'm at 10k right now. I do not have enough gold for anything at this point. And I have actually bought some of the (3x) 5‚Ç¨ offers. On the other hand I know there are beta players literraly drowning in gold without anything to do with it. We need some kind of solution to avoid both situations. I like what has been told in the subreddit before, about being able to donate gold, but that does not actually give a solution to the donator. What are your thoughs?
