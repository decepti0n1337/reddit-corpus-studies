What is “XD” going to do in a conversation?
---
I think you're confused, the meme is talking about those people that throw their turret outside the middle of the map, like outside the main walls, lucky you if you haven't had those people
---
What if I told you that the green smoke took Shelly, therefore showing it has to do with showdown.
---
tortoise
---
Yeah I see your point there are other ones that deserve it and really are great but dude why be toxic I mean I saw what you said to this person and wow you really are toxic I mean yeah it’s low quality but what if he never knew about screen recording in the first place and yeah it is low quality but who knows this person could be a thirteen year old that barley has reddit and I mean he only has 37 days and dude he is trying his best to try and get something out there and yes I will agree with you on this it is low quality but that doesn’t give an excuse to bash his hopes by calling his posts pathetic and other stuff like that like dude what if you were this guy and you got your own posts bashed with a anvil full of negativity and I see this person having potential in the future he just needs to grow and learn and holy shit dude you just want him to stay low on the ground don’t ya

Neither is you commenting your toughts on the internet yet here we are

No, since the frank was in the bush.

I think it's actually quite good, I've seen way worse posts in Hot.

Not trying to act like some child and point hands but in truth, he started calling me pathetic first and telling me to grow up and shit. Now I wasnt that toxic at first cause all I had said first was that his upvotes were bots. I just can't stand it when kids just be like "grow up" when they dont understand what they're talking about.
---
I always lose every single game since the brawlers I have maxed don’t work well on the maps

I just got Bibi!

They act like they are above everyone else and can do whatever the hell they want.

U dont even need to tell me how long this took u beautiful masterpiece

I mean, theres some weird coach cory sh*t, also the weird weeeeird kids that somehow know how to post here. Mine had a joke at least...or a common quote, this one in particular i remember seeing on some cartoons i believe.

yikes feels bad. even in long distance maps if i see a piper i lose all hope. what can they do once they have to defend by themselves?

I always hated the trophy inflation a few months back. Now as a 18k i still get matched with 6ks

Nice

Its a joke dumbass

Thank you so much. I was so ready for all the hate comments about the hands but i really appreciate your comment. I think i did an okay job on everything but the hands
---
Ah, I’ve been playing since beta, when brawl stars was still in portrait orientation. Yeah, some of friends are in the same boat as u. Best of luck, hopefully u get crow first. Most fun legendary

Hey! I saw this one!

Weeeee!

Leon buff? He needs a nerf
---
I'm guessing you bought him with the special deal for him and the skin ༎ຶ‿༎ຶ
---
I’m working my way up there for Leon about 18 hours ago and now I’m at 550
---
What does that even mean
---
CAPS LOCK
---
I personally say yessssss!🤩🤩🤩
---
That was random
---
And you saying this, is alr free speech
---
Sir can you stop being horny while you play games or do anything
---
I really enjoyed this video. Thank you
---
The excitement is real when unlcoking a new brawler even a rare one :D i got spike like 4 months ago but my volume was down and i was talking to my bro and just opened the single box i had didn't see how he spins. It's good to see it in the video

Nothing is limited time, only star shelly. The Christmas/lunar new year/Halloween will all be back next year. Confirmed by frank

Sorry, i didnt notice that, i will delete this post

When everyone saw the Leon wolf pack that just started begging for mercy lol. Also I did this once as El primo and I got about five kills because the square was so small that I could hit everyone and can I just say i ended all their careers by spamming supers
---
Did you use hacks there are lots of nines and high numbers except for your trophies.
---
I’m open to criticism
---
This is going to be the next "draw for 3 crowns" that was in clash royale
---
Laughs in skilled pipers and snappy sniping.
---
I do agree with some part of ur statement though. If a piper has to defend by herself it really comes down to the positioning of piper, the ball, and the enemies as well as piper being able to hit her shots
---
The fact the Carl hit all of them with his pickaxe? No
---
No
---
You automatically unlock them. At least, theu show up in your brawlers page
---
btw is it theoretically possible?
---
I love what you are

Its a cute Meme Template! I will use it sometime soon!

This is wrong in so many ways

Second grade nostalgia
---
deserves more upvotes, feels bad but I upvoted with all of my account(2)
---
I get that, it’s just that, people with brawlers that’s have high amounts of trophies know what to do, most of the time. Having a rank 26 Brock with rank 20 teammates against higher trophy brawlers doesn’t seem very fair

I want him to sound like a robotic mr krabs

---
Yo I legit did the same thing it feels amazing pushed him purely in solo showdown I had saved up all of his power points and I just recently upgraded him up to level 7 and bought werewolf Leon
---
There's different ways to look at the situation:
---
1) Aggressive Behaviour
---
Attacking (and presumably killing) others simply reduces the damage they deal to the boss due to respawn time, walking, etc, but may put you at a disadvantage due to less ammo to use on the boss. And since there are 10 players every Takedown match, every time you take down a brawler, there'll still be 8 other. But still a valid strategy.
---
One more, some people may look for revenge and kill you instead, resulting in low placements for both of you. High risk, high reward strategy.
---
2) Passive Power Cube Hunt
---
Basically be passive until you amass a large number of Power Cubes and then just steamroll the boss. Not very ideal because a) you'll most likely be a target to attack, b) it's hard to judge the distance between you and the boss, so time wasted = less HP to bring down, c) you may not have enough HP left on the Bot to beat the current first. Very high risk, low reward strategy, and very unpredictable to play.
---
3) Passive Boss Killer
---
Simply go after the boss and unleash maximum damage on it, every single time. Consistent DPS on the boss can get high placements, but also run the risk of being targeted by others. An average strategy, not too risky nor too low reward.
---
4) Neutral Power Cube Hunt
---
Same as Passive Power Cube Hunt (see 2), but you kill any offensive brawlers. Same pros and cons, except that on the way to the boss, time may be lost on attacking others.
---
5) Neutral Boss Killer
---
What I would go for. By removing any threats, you can ensure hyper consistent DPS. Similar to Passive Boss Killer strategy (see 3).
---
***If there are no offensive brawlers, this essentially becomes Passive Boss Killer, and a race about DPS. (see 8)
---
6) Aggressive Power Cube Hunt
---
The difference with this and Aggressive Behaviour (see 1) is that you constantly seek out targets to kill whilst collecting Power Cubes. This is very much not ideal as you run the high risk of dying with a lot of Power Cubes, and what I would consider the worst of the list.
---
7) Aggressive Boss Killer
---
Simply a mix of Aggressive Behaviour (see 1) and Passive Boss Killer (see 3), by dividing DPS between enemy brawlers and the boss is one of the hardest things to do as the risk of dying is extremely high and the DPS may not be very consistent. Even so, if able to pull this off, I can only guarantee a mediocre placement. Not very ideal.
---
8) Passive Game
---
Last but not least, to address 'teaming' in Takedown - I would refer to this term as 'Passive Game', where everyone assumes the role of a Passive Boss Killer (see 3) and it's just a race about DPS. At this point, I can't guarantee any placements, just spam on the boss as much as you can.
---
***When writing this, I made Shield and Varied Attacks irrelevant, feel free to bring up and discuss about them.
---
First time?
---
Yeah even though my used my 750 bull, I still got matched with that shelly
---
The format isn’t even that good imo
---
My theory: Brawl Stars tries to even out the match making by putting 1 very unlucky high trophy player in with 2 low trophy players against 3 mid-high trophy count players
---
Nice Artstyle! Please put a small watermark to prove it is yours so others don't steal it.

How many people still missing legends in here? I just got sandy yesterday so I now I got all 4 🙌🏼 🙌🏼 but I did buy mecha crow with that $20 summer deal which kept my drop rate high for sandy 😉 while taking about drop rates, does anyone know if the rates still move up even tho they show 0.00 when u have all type of brawler?kuz if it doesn’t that really sux, it would mean drop rates can only move up when your trying to get brawlers, so if a new one comes out your % stood the same the whole time U’ve been opening boxes.

Yes I know it’s real. I thought that guy was joking. I didn’t think he was that stupid

Teaming is a strategy.

Because people would report their teammates because they get mad even if they don't go AFK or throw the game

i also lack in the currenty to max playabels am so not happy cuz 3 caracters have the power of 9 :'(

I got that exact amount 3 seasons ago

I'm on 14k trophies. Got full power for all the brawlers, so I just get gold from boxes. Still NO LEGENDARIES AT ALL.

I'm not sad, I'm mad xD

Did you get a lot of star points?
---
Yes
---
But what did it cost?
---
3000 trophies
---
Deep down we all know old-school “Eagle Warrior” theme was better instead of this baseball cap rubbish
---
As for the skin, Dark Mecha Crow first
---
Poor mega box doesn’t even have a chance to open a brawler 😖
---
En reddit la mayoría de gente habla en inglés, intenta hacer tus posts en inglés porque sino no te entenderán
---
Looks like hentai
---
What servers?
---
if you earn more than 2000 star points every season and don't care about skins - yes(you earn enough to buy both but you can only buy 1 mega box per season so why not). 
---
if you earn less than 1500 - nope. (you will eventually run out of star points,use them for max value)
---
between 1500 - 2000 - when you have collected that 500 extra over the average 1500 points.
---
He has bad luck with matchmaking so its hard to earn trophies.
---
HAHA LOL XD
---
Trickshots, bull in eye of the storm
---
it showed wrong graphic. you needed to get that rank before season reset. trophies you won were added to the total after reset.
---
Its the bottom of the brawler list you can see a bit at the top
---
the fuck? people buy new phones in different countries all the time, i intend to buy next iphone when ill visit US because its much cheaper than in europe, and if you are there for 14 days and you want to brawl....
---
Its the bottom of the brawler list you can see a bit at the top. I get the joke but other people will see it to and we need a higher quality meme
---
is it dangerous if a have bs on my phone AND ipad? i dont want to get banned for playing on 2 devices 😄
---
Hol up why the bump down there
---
speed helps you dodge attacks and reach targets(low health brawler, heist safe, bolts)faster. if you find it bad , chances are you knock targets away from yourself.  knock them into close by obstacles like walls and then kill.
---
dont forget accidentally launching enemy into the air via jump platform
---
Yeah nah
---
Older lex
---
Thats actually sick
---
#YOU ARE TOUCHING DA CHILD!!??

I’m not sure if u mean “sick” as in “nice, cool, etc” or “sick” as in literally terrible.... forgive me for my stupidity ;w;
---
Even now after many nerfs, Leon is still very good
---
It’s true though :v (poco main here)
---
Like an insane portrait
---
a max shelly hitting one shell does 420, one card of tara at lvl 1 does 420, old max rico did 420, max gene against rosa with super does 420
---
Ikr. After season reset today I played my 750 bull and got 2 horrible teammates. Level 6 colt and a level 7 dynamike, both at about 500 trophies. Something needs to be done...
---
Even though supercell says teaming is allowed, they still don’t like it, which is why if you play a map with healing circles or meteors, the healing circles will never go near you and the meteors will always go after you if you team!
---
Again I’m not sure if it’s positive or negative ;w; I’m really stoopid.
---
But thank you very much anyways :3

I mean I like the fact that crow is getting attention now but I agree the should buff leon a bit instead of just nerfing him at this rate he is gonna be the worst legendary

Yeah, got that

Tick shouldnt be nerfed, hes already weak

It’s really cool. Want to see this map in game. But I feel there are too many bushes
---
Is someone gonna tell him that’s not an iphone😬
---
n o o o o o
---
Hey, I just wanna know what he said out of curiosity
---
thanks
---
Dude! Finally someone who understands! Those kids just want him to be broken like when he was on the first day of his release! And that what you said was all true, if hes a close range brawler, there is no point of buffing him at long range...he can chip damage at long range unril he gets his super and then he can go invis and pick his targets. Thats how leon works...so the only buff that he actually needs is that super buff...they need to make it 7 second because even I realised (after playing a little bit more leon) that it is a little bit underpowered. So they should make it 7 or 8 seconds again. My opinion on that, everything other that you said is just perfection...im glad that there is finally someone who understands!
---
HOLY SHIT SAME whats the point of spending money on a game if i wont be bettert than others
---
I mean... It's pretty empty
---
 I didn't know you didn't have Piper :( well buy whatever your heart says the gems are yours it's your decision to choose which of the two, but wait for these new days that Piper is missing to see if it comes out
---
Let's make this 6969 downvotes
---
Your art style is my favorite that’s why i used the primo and Rico art of yours as my wallpaper
---
No there is a post 2 months ago on ur profilw
---
The only buff he needs is a super buff. And pros say that invisiheal is broken so that should be nerfed...but im not sure I dont have his star powers yet...
---
This is bullshit.  For a few reasons:
---
1) you can still test client side connection quality from anywhere. Packets dropped, jitter, distance, etc.
---
2) you could have the client ping the nearest game server data center if you want a more accurate test
---
3) the menu servers and game servers are probably in the same location anyway.
---
u/HuyDandylion look at this pathetic dude reposting your godlike post
---
Piper is actually good in some brawl ball maps. She is very map dependant but certainly one of the best in maps like backyard bowl
---
What do you mean you saw it? It's completely new!
---
thanks for letting me know
---
Yeah I’m gonna commit not alive because I can’t flex a 59 gem (4 fucking dollars) skin on a phone game. They don’t realize I’m better than them because i spent those gems on a skin instead of another
---
Thanks! ^^

I highly doubt that you didn't do anything else besides being lucky...

Awww that hurts

It is
---
Nah i made this in adobe photoshop mix. That software frequently makes low image res. I also included a lot of the old jokes from this subreddit, as long as they were pretty much ez upvotes. You won’t find this anywhere else
---
The thing is that we play brawl stars to have fun. If we lose we dont actually die, like in hunger games, ya know.
---
So as teaming only makes it fun for the teamers while completely ruins the victim's experience, it should be punished.
---
Hey, so I had a look at your account that you shared with Ryan and I can see that you have been banned like the screenshot says, for Account Sharing. This has nothing to do with playing on a new phone in a different country like your title says. From what I see there is no false ban here.
---
Can you private message me as there are a few questions I need to ask you, that is best kept private.
---
Weird flex, but ok.
---
You can download mods if you want the old models and menu
---
Ah, I see. Still believe it to be extremely low effort though.
---
how is this even a joke
---
But without her umbrella she can’t Kill Tick
---
Shut up you fucked up cow shit, i even fucking put this in google translate and nothing even came up, your parents are probably disapointed that the cheap condom they used was actually a plastic bag a fish choke on. Reddit is 13+ so get the fuck out before your mom looks what you are looking up you fuck-up

i didn't notice that!! i didn't even know there's a timer!

Why use discord when u can simply talk to ur random teammate how about that crow

there is a good chance that this image has a hint of upcoming brawlers.  if someone is good at this sort of stuff, find a clue for mythic brawler.

One person is not the whole companies opinion

Oh?

 YES HE SHOULD &gt;:[

Could this skin go on discount for 39 gems? Had that happened before?

This is why I followed this profile

You mean that bush over there?

it's low effort but we should be having discussion about the image as it is officially released by supercell and there is a chance that it might have hint for upcoming brawler. someone has to post it.

LMAO

Who you find the idea???

Let’s just downvote this. If he don’t like it. He could LITERALLY stop playing it.

Plot twist: Spike kills pam, and then takes jessie to “adopt her”. Spike is then registered as a sex offender a month later
---
My 0.06% legendary probability: Hilarious!
---
You never mentioned that it was that drawing, no shit I used that as my example picture but I did NOT trace. The whole point was to replicate that drawing and replace Jessie with Penny. 
---
If we’re going off of that, then why don’t we mention the drawing that she used as an example to make her’s? There’s really no argument here as I didn’t take her art and claim it as my own. I started from scratch with that CLEARLY as my example drawing, and people knew that. 
---
Using an example drawing, and starting for scraps with that example drawing is not stealing kid, you need to understand the difference. 
---
Are we going to call our EVERY artist on this sub for making meme formats by drawing brawlers in place of characters in the original format? 
---
You clearly don’t understand the difference between stealing and replicating. You should really look into it.
---

I hope supercell would add that

You are a rare Piper

From my guess, if different people are using one account, they will definitely conflict with each other. Like one is  playing, the other is trying to login. Or different login locations back and force several times in a short period of time with apparently specific devices at specific location. Or several different gamecenter accounts mixed linked to several BS account. Urrr I hope these guesses don't count as "discuss about cheating" because they are common sense? 
---
There are a lot of things that one person cannot do, and multiple person will definitely do.

DETAILS:
---
The idea of a 3rd star power for penny came while seeing a 20 k player from my club fighting in showdown. I noticed that penny's mortar is totally unuseful at close range and in the case of a bull/shelly/ darryl rushing her she wouldn't be able to react.
---
So, this star power gives penny the possibility of using her mortar to divide her basics attacks and fight melee brawlers. I also thought it would be cool if she could also divide them in Nita's bear, starky, pam and 8 bit things, etc.
---
Idk if this is too OP but i tried my best :)
---
Anyway any suggestion to make it more balanced or name suggestions will be appreciated.
---
that's weird. Because I have Crow and still have a chance of 0.1208.
---
Twice as big as yours

HAHAHA
---
If you watch other youtuber they said that Leon didn’t deserve that nerf + Crow has a lot of DoPe skin too
---
Bc you dont get it. Have you ever heard of microsoft word?
---
Guess it's an old screenshot...
---
Awesome.
---
What? The paragraphs aren't the problem. Your awful grammar and terrible spelling is he problem. Stop being dumb and try getting back your 22nd chromosome.
---
You are wrong here. Literally everybody uses word. Google docs are just a copy
---
Same...
---
I’m just camping in a bush, and a Brock supers me out of nowhere and I die. The Brock didn’t know I was in there. He just randomly supered a bush I happened to be in.

r/wooosh isn't a subreddit. You said r/wooosh even though that's completely wrong and it's r/woooosh with four o's
---
So do i but they're still super cringey
---
Well on phone they are. If there were paragraphs it would make sense. Thanks for insulting me toxic mortis main, but i got my 22nd chromosome
---
Okay, boomer, I would like you to tell me every single benefit of Word that Docs doesn't have.
---
The first box if is a little box always gives you 22 shelly power points
---
Credit the og.... just trying to help.

It literally has 4 os
---
I feel you
---
On this episode of I WANT MORE FREE SH\*T
---
How about your 23rd?
---
That's awesome, congrats
---
Your are a genius
---
example:
---
"Brawler name" need a nerf mom
---
He is still really good actually
---
Eh-ehm what?
---
Also, it's *there* not *they*
---
You changed very little. It’s still plagiarism.
---
Yes i got it since im literally typing rn
---
After you get to 14000 trophies are kinda meaningless so I mean makes sense to try for star points
---
Me either man. Looks nothing like a girl to me.
---
I’m 164 days late but i think you can now, was thinking about purchasing the OnePlus 7T Pro, is the 90hz on Brawl stars really noticeable compared to 60hz.
---
If you let them get close, or don't know how to sidestep. EMZ doesn't need to aim she just needs to keep her distance. So you can focus on juking enemy shots. 
---
The obvious exception being Mr Mobile Mortis. I imagine teammates feeding into mobility ults would also be irritating to deal with but at least that's counterplay.
---
Its there
---
wait, that's illegal
---
Uno reverse card
---
It's much better than taking forever to max out one card in Clash Royale
---
r/woooosh
---
Are you fucking kidding me? Almost all my brawlers are above 500 and only 7 are like 400 trophies, yeah you must have 3k to say Leon's super is broken
---
Feel like they coulda nerfed the attack and been done with it...
---
Poor sandy? Sandy is still very strong.  It's close between him and spike for best legendary, but sandy wins barely.
---
Well lemme check.
---
Wow! Amazing!
---
Well done! I'm amazed by all the work put into this collaboration!
---
epic gamer moment
---
Where tho?
---
Stop editing your comments. I'm not retarded
---
my friend got leon:

at 8500
---
But im sitting here at 11k with nothing.

Most
---
Wow , I found new pro player here!
---
I won one match
---
lmao i didnt edit it

You edited your comment. I'm not stupid, kid.

Oh rlly

Респект за то что не блэт

Your other one where you changed your r/wooosh to a r/woooosh
---
I’m not black don’t
---
Well, not a pro, only someone who can get star token on Lone star and Takedown at the first time
---
Miguel: Both?
---
Tulio: Both.
---
Miguel: Both is good
---
Also you can't tell me I'm the reason we lasted 3 mins in RoboRumble with a Mortis and Bibi (I think I was Pam)
---
There is no joke here since you insulted me
---
I literally made a 2nd account just to get the brawlers to 500 at level 1. At 1.5k I got Spike. And my 14k account hasn't any legendaries yet. I guess I'll go cry in a corner
---
Well, yes, but I love it anyway
---
37 what's your
---
Prove it
---
Same
---
Nah tht was bc of capital R bc im on phone
---
Only few specials like me can do that 😏
---
Its all in the auto aim
---
Im going to marry my 7 year old sister
---
The joke was that there was no way you could have lost your 23rd chromosome since it determines a lot about a person. You should go back to highschool cause it's very obvious you dropped out.
---
Ikr she actually kinda (insert non family friendly butting comment here)
---
Well, the girl cosplaying there is basically jessie, less the coincidence of having the same name as the brawler XD
---
Jessie:Where's my father.
---
This is tripy
---
Oof

surprised it isn't rico this time

Omgtiscicbr

Do you even know how to use this template ._.

Ah yes, not only that but not being able to upgrade my brawler to lvl 9 since it requires 1250 gold
---
Randoms be like:
---
✔ Do not show again
---
Jessie is actually like 2 or 3, you are very big for a 3 year old
---
Currently, we (players) don't have any ways to report those scums..
---
And, i understand how you feel because i have the same experience too :/
---
r/whoosh* and what I’m saying is he wrote “when the ENEMIES HEALING SHADE is running towards you” and the photo says here comes the invisible c*nt. The healing shade isn’t invisible soooo....
---
we just entered the matrix
---
Yes but from wich brawler is the head with this big ears ? The New brawler ?
---
No this makes it too easy
---
Thank you! Glad you loved it :)
---
Some people.might not like Rockability Mortis, or be able to get him
---
r/shittybrawlstars gang
---
I totally agree if we are taking starpowers into account.  If not I'm not sure, I wasn't looking at the list from a perspective of no star powers.
---
You completely missed the point. Brawler strengths aren't based on the rarity. The rarity says how unique a brawler is. Besides that, the legendaries are really strong. Leon is the worst but is still ok. Sandy is really strong, Spike is meta since forever and Crow is OP rightnow.
---
Sub in a nutshelly
---
What? Then what's so special? It will probably not live that long that it will be special
---
Yes, oj always play no hat ;-;
---
Actually the legendary refers to their unique attack styles/specials and manner of obtaining, not as to how strong they are or should be. If they were stronger than the others everyone would use them exclusively, making the game actually pay to win as not having any would set you back and not competitive  It would also remove incentive to play any others and harder to push them. If the game required payments for competitiveness we would also lose a lot of the community who will remain primarily F2P.  A balance is what we need, not a range of brawlers that are “a little op”.
---
Ironic he has the star power bull skin-
---
Kkk respond again when u ready
---
I was once top 31 global with shelly and 3rd of my country (Spain) and can relate how hard it is! Congrats!
---
Still the best legendary and a really good brawler tho lmao
---
Crow so you can show off twice as much
---
that name tho
---
Do you need someone to team with? I have a power 10 colt. BB?
---
ENDING THIS CHAIN ON ACCIDENt
---
but what if your parents dont pay you
---
Yesn't
---
That is really satisfying........
---
*misses* Nice shot
---
No.i meant that the bot was low health you poison it with crow then he jumps on a jump pad and dies  in mid air by the poison and you were in first place.
---
I got 13000
---
If your friend sends something to you, that means someone else made it. Since you know it wasn’t you who made it, you should
---
- find out who made it so you can credit them
---
- as a side effect of finding out who made it, notice they already put it on Reddit and thus don’t post it
---
Basically, don’t post memes you didn’t make on Reddit unless you’re certain it’s not on Reddit yet.
---
nita who is right there: \*visible confusion\*
---
Just let it go. the crash wasn't your fault  
---
dies twice

And emz’s super

So sad. Go to supercell contacts and tell them :)
