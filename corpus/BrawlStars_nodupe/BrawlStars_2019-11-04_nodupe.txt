---
What is ‚ÄúXD‚Äù going to do in a conversation?
---
I think you're confused, the meme is talking about those people that throw their turret outside the middle of the map, like outside the main walls, lucky you if you haven't had those people
---
What if I told you that the green smoke took Shelly, therefore showing it has to do with showdown.

Yeah I see your point there are other ones that deserve it and really are great but dude why be toxic I mean I saw what you said to this person and wow you really are toxic I mean yeah it‚Äôs low quality but what if he never knew about screen recording in the first place and yeah it is low quality but who knows this person could be a thirteen year old that barley has reddit and I mean he only has 37 days and dude he is trying his best to try and get something out there and yes I will agree with you on this it is low quality but that doesn‚Äôt give an excuse to bash his hopes by calling his posts pathetic and other stuff like that like dude what if you were this guy and you got your own posts bashed with a anvil full of negativity and I see this person having potential in the future he just needs to grow and learn and holy shit dude you just want him to stay low on the ground don‚Äôt ya

Not trying to act like some child and point hands but in truth, he started calling me pathetic first and telling me to grow up and shit. Now I wasnt that toxic at first cause all I had said first was that his upvotes were bots. I just can't stand it when kids just be like "grow up" when they dont understand what they're talking about.

I always lose every single game since the brawlers I have maxed don‚Äôt work well on the maps

Thank you so much. I was so ready for all the hate comments about the hands but i really appreciate your comment. I think i did an okay job on everything but the hands

Ah, I‚Äôve been playing since beta, when brawl stars was still in portrait orientation. Yeah, some of friends are in the same boat as u. Best of luck, hopefully u get crow first. Most fun legendary

I really enjoyed this video. Thank you

The excitement is real when unlcoking a new brawler even a rare one :D i got spike like 4 months ago but my volume was down and i was talking to my bro and just opened the single box i had didn't see how he spins. It's good to see it in the video

When everyone saw the Leon wolf pack that just started begging for mercy lol. Also I did this once as El primo and I got about five kills because the square was so small that I could hit everyone and can I just say i ended all their careers by spamming supers

Did you use hacks there are lots of nines and high numbers except for your trophies.

I‚Äôm open to criticism
---
This is going to be the next "draw for 3 crowns" that was in clash royale
---
Laughs in skilled pipers and snappy sniping.
---
I do agree with some part of ur statement though. If a piper has to defend by herself it really comes down to the positioning of piper, the ball, and the enemies as well as piper being able to hit her shots
---
The fact the Carl hit all of them with his pickaxe? No
---
No
---
You automatically unlock them. At least, theu show up in your brawlers page

btw is it theoretically possible?

deserves more upvotes, feels bad but I upvoted with all of my account(2)

I get that, it‚Äôs just that, people with brawlers that‚Äôs have high amounts of trophies know what to do, most of the time. Having a rank 26 Brock with rank 20 teammates against higher trophy brawlers doesn‚Äôt seem very fair

Yo I legit did the same thing it feels amazing pushed him purely in solo showdown I had saved up all of his power points and I just recently upgraded him up to level 7 and bought werewolf Leon
---
There's different ways to look at the situation:
---
1) Aggressive Behaviour
---
Attacking (and presumably killing) others simply reduces the damage they deal to the boss due to respawn time, walking, etc, but may put you at a disadvantage due to less ammo to use on the boss. And since there are 10 players every Takedown match, every time you take down a brawler, there'll still be 8 other. But still a valid strategy.
---
One more, some people may look for revenge and kill you instead, resulting in low placements for both of you. High risk, high reward strategy.
---
2) Passive Power Cube Hunt
---
Basically be passive until you amass a large number of Power Cubes and then just steamroll the boss. Not very ideal because a) you'll most likely be a target to attack, b) it's hard to judge the distance between you and the boss, so time wasted = less HP to bring down, c) you may not have enough HP left on the Bot to beat the current first. Very high risk, low reward strategy, and very unpredictable to play.
---
3) Passive Boss Killer
---
Simply go after the boss and unleash maximum damage on it, every single time. Consistent DPS on the boss can get high placements, but also run the risk of being targeted by others. An average strategy, not too risky nor too low reward.
---
4) Neutral Power Cube Hunt
---
Same as Passive Power Cube Hunt (see 2), but you kill any offensive brawlers. Same pros and cons, except that on the way to the boss, time may be lost on attacking others.
---
5) Neutral Boss Killer
---
What I would go for. By removing any threats, you can ensure hyper consistent DPS. Similar to Passive Boss Killer strategy (see 3).
---
***If there are no offensive brawlers, this essentially becomes Passive Boss Killer, and a race about DPS. (see 8)
---
6) Aggressive Power Cube Hunt
---
The difference with this and Aggressive Behaviour (see 1) is that you constantly seek out targets to kill whilst collecting Power Cubes. This is very much not ideal as you run the high risk of dying with a lot of Power Cubes, and what I would consider the worst of the list.
---
7) Aggressive Boss Killer
---
Simply a mix of Aggressive Behaviour (see 1) and Passive Boss Killer (see 3), by dividing DPS between enemy brawlers and the boss is one of the hardest things to do as the risk of dying is extremely high and the DPS may not be very consistent. Even so, if able to pull this off, I can only guarantee a mediocre placement. Not very ideal.
---
8) Passive Game
---
Last but not least, to address 'teaming' in Takedown - I would refer to this term as 'Passive Game', where everyone assumes the role of a Passive Boss Killer (see 3) and it's just a race about DPS. At this point, I can't guarantee any placements, just spam on the boss as much as you can.
---
***When writing this, I made Shield and Varied Attacks irrelevant, feel free to bring up and discuss about them.
---
First time?
---
Yeah even though my used my 750 bull, I still got matched with that shelly
---
The format isn‚Äôt even that good imo
---
My theory: Brawl Stars tries to even out the match making by putting 1 very unlucky high trophy player in with 2 low trophy players against 3 mid-high trophy count players

How many people still missing legends in here? I just got sandy yesterday so I now I got all 4 üôåüèº üôåüèº but I did buy mecha crow with that $20 summer deal which kept my drop rate high for sandy üòâ while taking about drop rates, does anyone know if the rates still move up even tho they show 0.00 when u have all type of brawler?kuz if it doesn‚Äôt that really sux, it would mean drop rates can only move up when your trying to get brawlers, so if a new one comes out your % stood the same the whole time U‚Äôve been opening boxes.

Yes I know it‚Äôs real. I thought that guy was joking. I didn‚Äôt think he was that stupid

---
What servers?
---
if you earn more than 2000 star points every season and don't care about skins - yes(you earn enough to buy both but you can only buy 1 mega box per season so why not). 
---
if you earn less than 1500 - nope. (you will eventually run out of star points,use them for max value)
---
between 1500 - 2000 - when you have collected that 500 extra over the average 1500 points.
---
He has bad luck with matchmaking so its hard to earn trophies.
---
HAHA LOL XD
---
Trickshots, bull in eye of the storm
---
it showed wrong graphic. you needed to get that rank before season reset. trophies you won were added to the total after reset.
---
Its the bottom of the brawler list you can see a bit at the top
---
the fuck? people buy new phones in different countries all the time, i intend to buy next iphone when ill visit US because its much cheaper than in europe, and if you are there for 14 days and you want to brawl....
---
Its the bottom of the brawler list you can see a bit at the top. I get the joke but other people will see it to and we need a higher quality meme
---
is it dangerous if a have bs on my phone AND ipad? i dont want to get banned for playing on 2 devices üòÑ
---
Hol up why the bump down there
---
speed helps you dodge attacks and reach targets(low health brawler, heist safe, bolts)faster. if you find it bad , chances are you knock targets away from yourself.  knock them into close by obstacles like walls and then kill.
---
dont forget accidentally launching enemy into the air via jump platform
---
Yeah nah

a max shelly hitting one shell does 420, one card of tara at lvl 1 does 420, old max rico did 420, max gene against rosa with super does 420
---
Ikr. After season reset today I played my 750 bull and got 2 horrible teammates. Level 6 colt and a level 7 dynamike, both at about 500 trophies. Something needs to be done...
---
Even though supercell says teaming is allowed, they still don‚Äôt like it, which is why if you play a map with healing circles or meteors, the healing circles will never go near you and the meteors will always go after you if you team!
---
Again I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs positive or negative ;w; I‚Äôm really stoopid.

n o o o o o
---
Hey, I just wanna know what he said out of curiosity
---
thanks
---
Dude! Finally someone who understands! Those kids just want him to be broken like when he was on the first day of his release! And that what you said was all true, if hes a close range brawler, there is no point of buffing him at long range...he can chip damage at long range unril he gets his super and then he can go invis and pick his targets. Thats how leon works...so the only buff that he actually needs is that super buff...they need to make it 7 second because even I realised (after playing a little bit more leon) that it is a little bit underpowered. So they should make it 7 or 8 seconds again. My opinion on that, everything other that you said is just perfection...im glad that there is finally someone who understands!
---
HOLY SHIT SAME whats the point of spending money on a game if i wont be bettert than others
---
I mean... It's pretty empty
---
 I didn't know you didn't have Piper :( well buy whatever your heart says the gems are yours it's your decision to choose which of the two, but wait for these new days that Piper is missing to see if it comes out

Let's make this 6969 downvotes

Your art style is my favorite that‚Äôs why i used the primo and Rico art of yours as my wallpaper

No there is a post 2 months ago on ur profilw
---
The only buff he needs is a super buff. And pros say that invisiheal is broken so that should be nerfed...but im not sure I dont have his star powers yet...
---
This is bullshit.  For a few reasons:
---
1) you can still test client side connection quality from anywhere. Packets dropped, jitter, distance, etc.
---
2) you could have the client ping the nearest game server data center if you want a more accurate test
---
3) the menu servers and game servers are probably in the same location anyway.
---
u/HuyDandylion look at this pathetic dude reposting your godlike post
---
Piper is actually good in some brawl ball maps. She is very map dependant but certainly one of the best in maps like backyard bowl
---
What do you mean you saw it? It's completely new!
---
thanks for letting me know
---
Yeah I‚Äôm gonna commit not alive because I can‚Äôt flex a 59 gem (4 fucking dollars) skin on a phone game. They don‚Äôt realize I‚Äôm better than them because i spent those gems on a skin instead of another

Nah i made this in adobe photoshop mix. That software frequently makes low image res. I also included a lot of the old jokes from this subreddit, as long as they were pretty much ez upvotes. You won‚Äôt find this anywhere else
---
The thing is that we play brawl stars to have fun. If we lose we dont actually die, like in hunger games, ya know.
---
So as teaming only makes it fun for the teamers while completely ruins the victim's experience, it should be punished.
---
Hey, so I had a look at your account that you shared with Ryan and I can see that you have been banned like the screenshot says, for Account Sharing. This has nothing to do with playing on a new phone in a different country like your title says. From what I see there is no false ban here.
---
Can you private message me as there are a few questions I need to ask you, that is best kept private.
---
Weird flex, but ok.
---
You can download mods if you want the old models and menu

Ah, I see. Still believe it to be extremely low effort though.

how is this even a joke

there is a good chance that this image has a hint of upcoming brawlers.  if someone is good at this sort of stuff, find a clue for mythic brawler.

One person is not the whole companies opinion

Oh?

 YES HE SHOULD &gt;:[

Could this skin go on discount for 39 gems? Had that happened before?
---
This is why I followed this profile
---
Quality as always
---
You mean that bush over there?
---
it's low effort but we should be having discussion about the image as it is officially released by supercell and there is a chance that it might have hint for upcoming brawler. someone has to post it.
---
LMAO

Who you find the idea???

Lol rekt

Let‚Äôs just downvote this. If he don‚Äôt like it. He could LITERALLY stop playing it.

My 0.06% legendary probability: Hilarious!
---
You never mentioned that it was that drawing, no shit I used that as my example picture but I did NOT trace. The whole point was to replicate that drawing and replace Jessie with Penny. 
---
If we‚Äôre going off of that, then why don‚Äôt we mention the drawing that she used as an example to make her‚Äôs? There‚Äôs really no argument here as I didn‚Äôt take her art and claim it as my own. I started from scratch with that CLEARLY as my example drawing, and people knew that. 
---
Using an example drawing, and starting for scraps with that example drawing is not stealing kid, you need to understand the difference. 
---
Are we going to call our EVERY artist on this sub for making meme formats by drawing brawlers in place of characters in the original format? 
---
You clearly don‚Äôt understand the difference between stealing and replicating. You should really look into it.

From my guess, if different people are using one account, they will definitely conflict with each other. Like one is  playing, the other is trying to login. Or different login locations back and force several times in a short period of time with apparently specific devices at specific location. Or several different gamecenter accounts mixed linked to several BS account. Urrr I hope these guesses don't count as "discuss about cheating" because they are common sense?

DETAILS:
---
The idea of a 3rd star power for penny came while seeing a 20 k player from my club fighting in showdown. I noticed that penny's mortar is totally unuseful at close range and in the case of a bull/shelly/ darryl rushing her she wouldn't be able to react.
---
So, this star power gives penny the possibility of using her mortar to divide her basics attacks and fight melee brawlers. I also thought it would be cool if she could also divide them in Nita's bear, starky, pam and 8 bit things, etc.
---
Idk if this is too OP but i tried my best :)
---
Anyway any suggestion to make it more balanced or name suggestions will be appreciated.
---
that's weird. Because I have Crow and still have a chance of 0.1208.

Bc you dont get it. Have you ever heard of microsoft word?

Awesome.

What? The paragraphs aren't the problem. Your awful grammar and terrible spelling is he problem. Stop being dumb and try getting back your 22nd chromosome.

Okay, boomer, I would like you to tell me every single benefit of Word that Docs doesn't have.

Eh-ehm what?

Also, it's *there* not *they*

You changed very little. It‚Äôs still plagiarism.

Yes i got it since im literally typing rn

After you get to 14000 trophies are kinda meaningless so I mean makes sense to try for star points
---
Me either man. Looks nothing like a girl to me.
---
I‚Äôm 164 days late but i think you can now, was thinking about purchasing the OnePlus 7T Pro, is the 90hz on Brawl stars really noticeable compared to 60hz.
---
If you let them get close, or don't know how to sidestep. EMZ doesn't need to aim she just needs to keep her distance. So you can focus on juking enemy shots. 
---
The obvious exception being Mr Mobile Mortis. I imagine teammates feeding into mobility ults would also be irritating to deal with but at least that's counterplay.

Its there

Are you fucking kidding me? Almost all my brawlers are above 500 and only 7 are like 400 trophies, yeah you must have 3k to say Leon's super is broken

Feel like they coulda nerfed the attack and been done with it...

Poor sandy? Sandy is still very strong.  It's close between him and spike for best legendary, but sandy wins barely.

Well lemme check.

There is no joke here since you insulted me

I literally made a 2nd account just to get the brawlers to 500 at level 1. At 1.5k I got Spike. And my 14k account hasn't any legendaries yet. I guess I'll go cry in a corner

The joke was that there was no way you could have lost your 23rd chromosome since it determines a lot about a person. You should go back to highschool cause it's very obvious you dropped out.

Ikr she actually kinda (insert non family friendly butting comment here)

Well, the girl cosplaying there is basically jessie, less the coincidence of having the same name as the brawler XD

Jessie is actually like 2 or 3, you are very big for a 3 year old

Currently, we (players) don't have any ways to report those scums..

r/shittybrawlstars gang
---
I totally agree if we are taking starpowers into account.  If not I'm not sure, I wasn't looking at the list from a perspective of no star powers.
---
You completely missed the point. Brawler strengths aren't based on the rarity. The rarity says how unique a brawler is. Besides that, the legendaries are really strong. Leon is the worst but is still ok. Sandy is really strong, Spike is meta since forever and Crow is OP rightnow.
---
Sub in a nutshelly
---
What? Then what's so special? It will probably not live that long that it will be special
---
Yes, oj always play no hat ;-;
---
Actually the legendary refers to their unique attack styles/specials and manner of obtaining, not as to how strong they are or should be. If they were stronger than the others everyone would use them exclusively, making the game actually pay to win as not having any would set you back and not competitive  It would also remove incentive to play any others and harder to push them. If the game required payments for competitiveness we would also lose a lot of the community who will remain primarily F2P.  A balance is what we need, not a range of brawlers that are ‚Äúa little op‚Äù.
---
Ironic he has the star power bull skin-
---
Kkk respond again when u ready
---
I was once top 31 global with shelly and 3rd of my country (Spain) and can relate how hard it is! Congrats!
---
Still the best legendary and a really good brawler tho lmao

Crow so you can show off twice as much

that name tho

Do you need someone to team with? I have a power 10 colt. BB?

No.i meant that the bot was low health you poison it with crow then he jumps on a jump pad and dies  in mid air by the poison and you were in first place.

If your friend sends something to you, that means someone else made it. Since you know it wasn‚Äôt you who made it, you should
---
- find out who made it so you can credit them
---
- as a side effect of finding out who made it, notice they already put it on Reddit and thus don‚Äôt post it
---
Basically, don‚Äôt post memes you didn‚Äôt make on Reddit unless you‚Äôre certain it‚Äôs not on Reddit yet.
