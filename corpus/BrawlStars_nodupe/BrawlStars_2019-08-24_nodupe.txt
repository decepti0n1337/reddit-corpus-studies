My meme from a few months ago was stolen too.

---
How do I do the link?
---
That cause you team like a moron . Teaming is cancer and it ruins the whole point of the game. Honestly, any one who teams has more legendaries than IQ points.
---
mortis flairs: mortis is good, he just requires a lot of skilllll
---

---
also mortis flairs: buff mortis!!!!
---
Mabey some people like this map
---
He shouldn't be named b**rock(et)**, but b**ear**
---
We need a trophy road rework*
---
Literally everyone when somebody brings chewing gum to school
---
In my next post you can find his apologies to redditors
---
Is it only me who realise that robo spike and robo Mike rhyme same with mecha crow and bo or am I dumb
---
He has to be right?
---
at least in cavern churn its possible to win as a brawler besides a close range. in eots, you literally cant walk two tiles without bumping into a bull in a bush
---
I'd hope so
---
The problem isn’t the recharge time. The problem is that, without warning, Shelly can go from nine hitpoints to 5040.
---
There are two solutions to this, that I can see.
---
- reduce Band-Aid’s effectiveness drastically (to 60% makes it so it can still technically restore Shelly to full health but realistically it leaves her at anywhere from 70-90%) 
---
- give it an indicator when ready. Bibi’s bat spins, Mortis’ lantern changes color/axe glows/dice don’t change for some reason. I can’t really think of any aspect of Shelly that would look right if it were altered, so perhaps it would require Shelly’s model have a bandaid put on one shoulder and made invisible if she’s level 1-9, has Shell Shock, or Band-Aid isn’t ready
---
Personally I’d lean more towards the second. An effective extra 3k-5k hitpoints depending on the scenario plus burst healing without needing to stop attacking/being hit may be statistically OP and need to be toned down seperately, but being killed by a Band-Aid that you don’t know about or don’t know is charged is a whole lot more unfair than rushing Nita’s bear and taking double damage for a second until you run away because you didn’t know, or needing to deal an extra thousand damage to Bull because he turns out to have a shield. The same as close-range brawlers don’t approach Shelly with her super ready or else they die, they don’t want to approach her with Band-Aid, and only one of those has an indicator.
---
Piper x Mortis and Tara x Mortis is wayyyy better. These all exist. Even Mortis x Poco. Coltis is a big fat no no.
---
I actually laughed at something in this sub..... but i gotta address the elephant in the room, 6k boxes
---
Same,
---
I said why lol u didnt give a reason but it's okay I respect opinions
---
barley, tick, and dynamike are great as long as you stay out of the bushes. poco and nita also arent so bad. you usually get a ton of #2's, and even the occasional #1 if some of the bushes in the center are cleared or the other last persons another thrower.
---
Shit I didn't know this and I'm at 12800.
---
My disappointment... is immeasurable *slight robotic sob*
---
With coiled snake his skill ceiling is raised and his skill cap is lowered from needing advanced predictions
---
To be fair, the menu layout is *slightly* similar to fortnite, and definitely got inspiration (but we dont talk about that). But yes, Brawl Star's menu layout is very user-friendly.
---
You are so stupid you didn't even notice the "Do not steal" and did it anyways.
---
'competive players are joke'
---
'over 600 she is op'
---
Make up your fucking mind
---
Hello Poco!
---
A polish, to clean the ruffed edges.
---
Well i tried
---
I dont normally say art is bad but this is bad
---
Hello poco
---
Can you join private "lwarb" severs?
---
Idk sounds like broke to me man
---
So if I got it then it means piper mains are never going to get a baby because since she is thicc and in a video game so they will stay virgins , I’m probably so wrong.
---
Recommendation maybe a weekly new player q&amp;a where they can ask any questions they want.
---
The word of 15 players doesn’t change how band aid Shelly completely changed the meta. That’s what I’m saying. That wouldn’t have happened if she was B tier.
---
i think we cout use some custom updoot and downdoot buttons. Gl everyone ;D
---
That made me hate BrawlStars a bit especially using Darrell
---
This guy is gonna get so much karma from all these lol. Good job tho
---
r/woooosh
---
Mortis
---
Noice
---
In general. If you want to die, take work. Then the only few people that search by new will kill you.
---
it’s because no likes piper mains

3v3's.
---
it's sad seeing halfbrick do this considering how popular their games were back in the early 2010's, really hits you hatd
---
Offended piper main noises, at least I tried understanding the joke xd
---
^
---
Go to battle log if you don’t remember
---
Imagine how triggered everyone was
---
Omfg, I am sorry for your loss
---
*proof and this joke has been overused so many times
---
That’s why i said 400-600 because i did maths, if you were playing 3v3s, you would get 8 trophies, I don’t think you won every game so instead of saying 480-600, i said 400 because you probably won most of your games
---
In duos,the max you can get is 540, so if you won most games, it’s around in the 400s
---
Already on it
---
Tiny,,,,,,,,,
---
My bad
---
Awesome :)
---
Hi
---
On one hand mortis' star power, coiled snake, can very much make a difference to approach a brawler. Rather than dodging and approaching slowly without getting hit too often, quickly sent to retreat, his boosted distance can make the risk of loosing too much hp less hazardous, but do remember he takes an eternity to recharge his starpower and moderate health brawlers can still send a mortis to retreat or kill him, its not so broken that show downs will have him like og rosa, nowhere near bandaid shelly
---
Yes!! Im really close to get those incredible 13k 150 coins
---
If you wonder what is this? Its nulls brawl
---
I agree with MrTrickshots. Definitely an unusual concept. Nice art though!
---
Very good scale drawing
---
Llll
---
I loved the movie too although seeming a bit more lighthearted than the show
---
r/shittybrawlstars
---
It’s a bot
---
I'm gonna think of this every time I see his speeding off with his new star power
---
Spike: Bushes regrow whenever he walks on them
---
how about changing her super to something better
---
I agree , her super is too op
---
You have forgot the brawlbox
---
Black mecha bo
---
I got him to 500 at level 3 with randoms in thousand lakes
---
Yes, it happens rarely, but it can still happen if everyones Brawler is at a +/- 10 trophies and is above ~800 trophies.
---
Hope he doesn't turn into an Italian mob boss
---
Okay. I get what you mean. I will now compare Duel to many other events to sort of capture the differences and problems it has.
---
If you want to hone your 1v1 skills in unfavorable matchups, try Showdown. You have an option to back down or pick a fight. Showdown rewards skill with power cubes and less trophy loss / greater trophy gain. The wuss hiding in the bushes won't be rewarded as much as the aggressive fighter destroying everyone in their path. You can, to a certain extent, choose your own battles (similiarly to 3v3 ,although the options become fewer as time goes on.)
---
But in Duel you have no choice in your opponent, similiar to the suspenseful moment in showdown where there are 2 brawlers left and you're waiting to find out who you're up against. It could be the uplifting feeling when you're a Mortis and you're against a Dynamike, or the sinking feeling when you're a Frank and you're against a Shelly with a super. It can sometimes be a bit unfair.
---
Except for the fact that there are no powercubes to help you overpower the opponent, and you'll lose trophies instead of gaining a respectable amount (rank 2 is +8, I believe, nothing to be angry over). As I have mentioned in my other comment, it's a rock paper scissors.
---
Another problem proposed by the other commenters is getting 1 kill and then evading the opponent for the remainder of the game. This is reminiscent of getting 1 point in Brawl Ball and then playing defence for the remainder of the game. However, this is not a problem in Brawl Ball because unlike in Duel, the best defense is offense. Keeping the ball close to the goal is risky, so why not get it as far away as possible? And maybe, you could keep the enemy busy with all your advances. so that they cannot organize an attack? This is why Brawl Ball does not have this issue.
---
However, combat always has the risk of death. Why stick around for more Kill points when it's less risky to avoid engagement? Perhaps you could get 2 or 3 points, and then play Hide and Seek for the rest of the game? Before arguing that getting more points will better secure your victory, apply this logic to Gem Grab, another event which I am about to use as a vessel for my explanation. It is incredibly stupid to stick around for more gems when your team already has enough. (Exception is when the enemy team also has many gems, then go get those shinies.) The only difference between this situation and the Duel situation? It's okay to die in Gem Grab if you don't have gems or if your team mate can just scoop it all up for you. You don't need to fear death unless you're all alone. Except in Duel, you are truly all alone. No one to cover for you, it's just you and the mystery brawler that may or may not be the hard counter to your character.
---
As much as I would like a 1v1, it would be best not to put it into a trophy-based event rotation. I would totally play for tickets.
---
Brawlers to upgrade: 69
---
Get ready for more hat-less drawings
---
Teaming will always be a problem for solo showdown, it only happened less on CC mainly because of the huge amount of bushes that made teaming difficult but sometimes throwers would roam around the outskirts and constantly check the bushes. Personally I thought this map was good, great way to show skill but not die immediately when the game starts.
---
Giorno Giovanna would like to have a word with you
---
She must have snuck in...or maybe that Bibi's +1.
---
???
---
ok they are teaming but wow they good at backstabbing too like wth
---
And have people block 100 people and wait 10 minutes for a match?
---
Not really
---
Probably cuz two of the ppl in ur team r in the same room which also happens to be the rank 0 colt
---
Nice job
---
Lwarb?
---
Everyone one's sleeping on the fact that my man's Darryl still ain't got a voice
---
Null's Brawl
---
How come?
---
She dosent need a nerf. But they should have not nerfed her before and just nerfed her range
---
Wait did this actually happen
---
I got band-aid as my first star power and pushed my Shelly past 700 with it
---
Why would it.
---
اما في عرب في ريديت
---
Good effort.
---
BRUH
---
_*No, I don’t think I will_*

Ahh okok thanks :)

Ahh yah, good point. Thanks dude :)
---
Lol Report won't solve anything because trolling doesn't break the terms of service. And supercell can't handle thousands of reports everyday
---
Hahahahah I'm indecisive brotha 😂
---
Say sike right now
---
عبادي i am killer wana play now ?
---
I still lose 9 trophies in seige with some of my brawlers so not really much difference
---
What app?
---
Bro I was about to post something about that little glitch. To late now I guess
---
I'm actually right there so no more free stuff for me I guess
---
And do you think supercell would waste thousands of dollars every month just to have the community satisfied?
---
Supercell can't ban trolls unless they want to break their own terms of service
---
Sorry can't answer, having trouble reaching the truth.
---
Wait you lose 40 trophies a game!? How much do you gain per win??
---
Nope its fake, if it was real he/she wouldn’t have 0 ep
---
Oh yeah I never thought of that maybe
---
Um, well who do you like more?
---
I was complaining about 14k with 24 brawlers until I saw this post
---
Poco is fairly easy to push in brawlball and gem grab
---
i dont play solo showdown cause i hate teaming but in a solo survival game it is to be expected. bt teaming in duos is just disgusting, you already have a team ffs.
---
I like that idea but that seems like a lot of star points.
---
That’s impossible. There are only 27 brawlers in game. You can’t get 69 upgrades.
---
but flex ok wierd
---
Yeah I agree with you.. star powers with amazing potential are fine if there’s a skill cap involved. Shouldn’t penalise people who worked hard to be good at the game
---
Band aid in principle is fine but it rewards lazy ppl... Like bushcamping in showdown etc, spamming desperately then getting lucky cos their super and bandaid kicked in then they spin on you like they achieved something lol. Very rarely do I see Shellys that make well-thought out plays with bandaid; I would be fine with that. 
---
The rest I feel are fair reward for positive, skilled play, they should stay that way.
---
May i hate you
---
Let me guess, you've watched season 4-7 which are the worst seasons, 1-3 were the golden age, no childhood what did you grow up watching? MLP!
---
Nah, even her range is fine. It's less than bulls...but I agree the last nerf or two wasnt needed.
---
She does way more damage than bull at max range
---
I've never seen a 6 in my entire life before :(
---
But she still only has his range, which is short af.
---
The sub reddit should have a certain amount of karma to post, so people dont spam the sub
---
i don't speak
---
Call the amberlamps.
---
Jesus Christ y’all really hate teamers. They’re annoying but I dont like wish death on them
---
the game already have this option, you just need to move your finger to the center of the super button
---
bro calm down he is
---
I don't think this will work. I am sure most people won't upvote. If I have 0 upvotes I will be matched with 0 upvotes players even if I deserve like 20 upvotes
---
Nah, it dont. It's most likely people in a room together.
---
Mortis creepy harvest: Mortis crops have gone bad.
---
Not the case according to this conversation
---
Go look at my post the gene first match and faced 700 ppl
---
Well, I think there are many people who are luckier than you but there are a lot of people far unluckier than you... so I suppose just missing two is not the worst place to be at 11k. Many will kill to be in your shoes. 
---
Paying money to open boxes may not necessarily make things that much better, sometimes you can open 500 boxes and not get anything if u have horse turd for luck. 
---
That’s why some people who do spend money are just buying the brawlers or star powers when they appear in the shop cos it’s actually cheaper that way 
---
So cheer up you’re not really in a bad spot and your odds are pretty decent
---
Put A Replay Flair On Your Post. Videos Or Plays With No Replay Flair Won't Be Reviewed. He Said In One Of His Videos "Tag Your Flair A Replay," Or Something Like That Idk
---
Wow
---
I know just is for more comfort do not think that all my life I launched the super air
---
Thanks! However I'm missing 3, Bibi Leon and crow
---
Maybe not showdown, but he's always in my gem grab games, I'm guessing he was in about 80-90% of my gem grabs, and man he gets annoying when he crosses the center of the map with a giant dash. And no, it's not anywhere near as op as Rosa was and band-aid is still more annoying then it, but I'm saying maybe make so it's not so far, maybe 180-190% attack range instead of 200%.
---
I hate seeing people post clips like those.
---
Not according to REALITY
---
I love it
---
Random weird but ok
---
WOW you almost have more trophies than me 😱😱😱
---
It'd be irony if this got more attention than the original. Lol!
---
Yeah every time I open a box I'm like plz be Leon or spike plz plz plz but in reality they are just the cutest smol beans of Brawlstars
---
PELOOOOO PELUCHEEEEEE
---
Btw the background represents what
---
rarity he is so it’s red so that means
---
Tyrone is a Mythic.
---
Its prib people in a party
---
Sorry... Im just so... tire-d
---
I made canal grande in Minecraft
---
Cavern churn with metoers would be wonderful, get rid of all that damn grass.
---
I know my real answer is frank
---
Because even though I'm the one being teamed on it goes after me 5 times in a row. That's why.
---
Normie
---
3 tiles is like a quarter of her attack it’s actually pretty large u should check “training cave” and put piper against the wall and aim across (side ways) and tell me if I’m wrong
---
Damn dude i miss that Brock nice dance move and red glasses.
---
They dont have to ban them, just dont match them up with me.
---
Wao cool
---
Also if you want I can try to push 1100 next season?? Maybe...
---
Geometery Rocks!
---
First Pipis that did NOT give me nightmares. Gg man
---
I'm still hoping someone will make an El Primo that looks like Strongbad.
---
Sry xD but thx
---
I hope so lol, but once u reach the newest 1000 trophies and get nothing out of the box, u lose the will to play lol

Oh.. Then fuck those randoms, try your best to play with a team or play a brawler that can hard carry the whole team if they suck like primo or shelly or Frank don't depend on ur team
---
No, did anyone ask you to post this crap?
---
I have 16k trophies and win around 2000 star points per season, 2 seasons and a half for just a background, is too much, that should be around 500 star points max, not 5000.

Yes, but actually no. WHERE IS THE FFF*CKING BRAWL TALK?!

No frank said that the game will be released in iOS and Android at the same time I think bouth Qt 26 . I am pretty sure that they were working on the game for a long time
---
r/Ibrokethechain

I knew that

I make animation about brawl stars too. But i don't have a lot of views((
---
*uh not in*

all mortis gang is shaking
---
I was know this

Removed. Rule 3. No providing information on how to break Supercell Terms of Service.

Ya, but the shape are similar
---
Trust me, he will just say that it’s his art. Just like Darius stole Gedi-Kor’s art
---
you can tell its not from the stripes in the background
---
nice job dude good luck getting leon and spike as well!
---
When she came out she was op as boss, I got 3:20 with her
---
What, they removed it??
---
me too
---
Hopefully is not like cash royal lmao , n it should be online but i think it will be like groups vs groups bc is called rush wars but hopefully is 1v1 I doubt it but hopefully bc if not we would have the same problem with randoms, i like to depend on my skill only
---
r/crowgang
---
I don’t get it.

r/foundthemobileuser

Nice pun teenager.

I'm a f2p and i have the two star powers of nita/mortis, the first of el primo and pocho at level 9, I'M WAITING FOR THE FUCK*NG STAR POWER

Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL

Cute
---
And this is a repost
---
Don’t it’s illegal
---
really brilliant but gem grab is a classic mode and it is complex for starters too and nobody wants them to have a hard time or they will leave once and some noobs will do own goal and ruin the game thats why
---
How did you push? Which mode?
---
Good morning cake day boy
---
Make it slightly easier for new players to start playing or give more coins out
---
Wtf
---
When you are that buddy ✌️👀
---
Honestly though 9.5/10
---
What's it about
---
Nothing impressive when ppl cleared insane 16
---
It doesn't seem like it's photoshopped
---
Big up for you supercell i love you so much

Anything under 5K is still a noob, 800 is nothing.
---
Ur not even 15k
---
Well yes
---
The map is poorly designed overall, and I don’t need to show my stats to some random stranger.
---
nah brawl stars is a great game and have a very high potential to become even better than before by adding new brawlers and game modes and new features

Sucks that supercell will now focus more on other games. Especially the upcoming ones
---
Why do you ask?
---
Penny op
---
I feel your pain cause it is also mine
---
Nice map...i really like the idea
---
Ah that’s why the matchmaking is so bad!
---
I heard some dumbass said this before he said using doublers on robo rumble would be better than normal games I facepalmed so hard...  Doesn't change anything if u used when in the end u still get a fixed amount of extra tokens so what's the point of disabling it
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
I know right, he was milliseconds from killing that Gene
---
Hope that it's gonna be free
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
😂😂😂
---
I think it's rush wars right
---
....
---
Thats how you know it cant be real
---
Well, we have had quite the trouble with normies getting into r/dankmemes. Keanu Reves memes died a while ago and we keep getting new meme templates everyday
---
Nah because ir doesnt have troops, you control a character like a brawler but its call comander
---
And Minecraft memes? You obviously still love them you fucking normie lmao
---
if it's not yours why is there a watermark
---
yes
---
Why are you using piper in robo rumble
---
They don’t care about getting trophies after that. The goal is to kill you and then spin on your corpse lol
---
Oh for sure.
---
That’s cool. But it says troops in the desc whut
---
Sì
---
Everyone stop posting stuff from lwarb!!!
---
wheb i call support team in brawl stars theh send me a stupid bit you repeat QnA
---
I using shelly
---
Prolly cuz a power 10 Piper still significantly out matches a power 1.
---
Hello madafaka
---
I have Minecraft memes because I have a littlebrother who likes minecraft, so I can say memes to him about minecraft
---
No clue, sounds good to me though
---
I got 25 once😌
---
Ok sure lol "my little brother likes it that's why"
---
O Guedes that's gonna be a fighting brawl game, because of the message they shared, "A New Challenger is approaching" is from Super Smash Bros when youre gonna challenge a new character that you will unlock
---
Lmao
---
You are playing on the wrong map
---
Yup
---
shiiiba niitaa
---
Would a normie be interested in a game like Mario kart wii, thats over 12 years old?
---
Mmmmm bushes
---
*shelly intensifies*
---
So This is why no brawl stars updates. 😔
---
  
---
Guess brawl stars flopped, 😔
---
*Cries in Vietcong*
---
will it come out in US?

i feel the exact opposite

How tf does that even matter?

just because they released a new game doesn't mean everyone will leave brawl stars

You still need have 69 tokens remaining 69 boxes left and 69 tokens for the box
---

---
Y is there bounty stars in a seige?

And also having 3 IKE turrets is a bad idea
---
Thanks, I hate it

I am, but I don't understand

I am 14 idiot

Now THATS real information!

True...

I guess...?

Ur trying to brag aren't u :)
---
That sounds amazing!
---
Shakers incoming!
---
That was close
---
Ok thanks.
---
The title says that this is technically a repost
---
Imagine someone with dyna jump trolling you the whole game going over Walls
---
Now
---
Completely toxic for no reason. Disgusting
---
Thats been around for a while and it makes me uncomfortable
---
Lmaooooooo are you saying that unironically?
---
The real answer to why I tilted is... because I wanted to tilt lol
---
new brawler:Boner
---
How can you tell that.
---
When Gedi Kor runs out of ideas.. I'm jk btw. Great artwork
---
They will not do 3 star powers
---
 Not even 1260
---
You can tell by Movement and playstyle,Trying spinning and see if they do anything special back
---
You can do that? How?
---
The robot will just keep chasing and you have no way to get away. It makes you vulnerable
---
Look at my post I have worst than yours so stfu
---
I will shove these guns where they shouldn't be
---
Nobody hates this, but we don’t understand the similarity.

Don't tell me u guys purchased SUPER CATS!

I remember those days, that was so much fun

---
Absolutely. We need a game mode where the can't be teamers, throwers, bad randoms and when getting a bnet or king player is beneficial. It would be only fair if both players would be the same brawler maxed out (lvl 10) and with a non-broken star power

26 is an internal joke for the 26 months of Brawl Stars beta
---
It’s RUSH WARS
---
Ahhh Looks familiar (hehe)
---
First, Brawl Stars didn’t kill Clash Royale as Clash Royale didn’t kill Clash of Clans. And obviously Rush Wars won’t kill Brawl Stars if it goes global.
---
Nice meme
---
It has not been released yet. It will come out in beta on the 26th for Australia, Canada and new Zeland
---
*cry in vietnam*
---
And why is that the minimum? People have pushed to 16k with level 1 brawlers
---
No
---
Not sure tbh but It usually felt like bots since You can just camp them out and they'll keep on going the same spot at times

Amazing pixel art! Still shook that there's really a new SC game coming

Most patches of bushes aren’t even that large, you should be able to clear them in one maybe 2 dashes. 
---
I also don’t know why you are trying to go off one situation in which this tip isn’t effective. It’s the same as any other character, if you are caught with your pants down you are going to be punished, it’s not different with mortis.
---
Oh ok (but what kind of gf asks you to get 100 upvotes and she will do [action])

You should have a button called "formating help" under the right side of the text box when you try to make a comment, there's a bunch of little things you can do there.
---
(I'm on old Reddit on pc, and have never used any other form of Reddit so idk if it applies to the others as well).
---
Well, Mortis wasn't good in siege. He isn't good in new siege either, why do people use him? You literally trade the ability to snack a few bolts with having control, being good at defense and being good at offense, the literal 3 most important things in siege. You only have a good chance when you have luck with the enemy brawlers.

Hold up

But the mortis took damage, so the attack did hit the mortis...

Can you give players a gift to mark the descent of a new game?

Hope it's not bad

Well I killed two Mortises in one match without help (I have recording of that) so nope, not very Impossible, just need some practise

I felt physical pain.

That’s unfortunate :/

My hips are mysterious shaking as I sit still head down looking as I look at my phone with picture of a drawn picture of bibi
---
Oh hey, good eyes. He does land right next to the ball, I bet that's part of the bug more than the dash.
---
The dash put him close enough to the ball to trigger the pickup. The pickup may have unstunned him.

Oh god please no

Zillah is a burst damage brawler with half part sniper and half part melee, in her sniper form her main attack consists of a fire demon that travels in a straigh line.
---
And in her melee form her main attack is a damaging dash.
---
🏅Rarity: Mythic
---
🖤Stats:
---
🔫Sniper form stats
---
DMG: 1900
---
Range: 8 tiles
---
Health: 3380
---
🗡Melee form stats
---
DMG: 1700 
---
Range: 3.2 tiles (dash is 2.2 tiles)
---
Health: 4080
---
Her first super consists of transforming into a creepy darkness entity!, this form's main attack consists of a damaging 1.5 tile dash, when she transforms in her melee form she will have her super already charged, super in this form will enhance her next dash making it deal a little more damage (+200) and making it a little bit longer (+0.5 tiles)
---
Star Powers
---
⭐Euphoria: Each time she eliminates an opponent she will increase her movement speed by 8%
---
⭐Nervous: When she falls below 50% health her damage in both forms will increase by 300
---
Bruh this is terrible, the super button is already big enough!
---
Be sad
---
I dont want it to die too. Maybe this is the time where when a new SC game is released, the one before it doesnt die?
---
I dont know, Brawl Stars is my favourite mobile game.
---
Im talking about Darryls
---
Pull out and then center attack button and let go but slowly
---
I stopped playing about a month ago, but during this week I really got back into it. I'm having a lot of fun playing again. Maybe you just need to take a little break
---
darryl is my name, horniness is my game
---
Move with ur enemy, if they move left u move left, practice more because colt is one of the most easy brawler to dodge if u are good u at easily dodge 3 of his attacks

This picture is so true that it hurts my brain

They are still developing it, they will probably release new cool stuff at some point. I still like it a lot.

U betrayed the mortis gang, you deserve to die
---
Cavern churn geyyy
---
What game is this
---
Yes your right, alot of people find it be enough, but, wouldn't you like to be able to aim your super just like you aim you your normal shots. I may be wrong as I don't know how other experience their gameplay on other devices

This would also be a fair nerf to Shelly’s super stacking.  I made a post a while back where I melted an 11 power cube Shelly as a 0 power cube Shelly just because I had my super.

He got nerfed because he was op and we can still kill you (I don't like drama m8)
---
This was leaked. Not sure if it’s true or not.
---
You posted the same thing twice with a template difference.
---
Can I sign up for beta?
---
Ricochet and me:SADNESS
---
Nope perfect one
---
Just wait until the skin will be for 69 (insert lenny face here) gems
---
How can it be your favorite brawler if you don't have it?
---
I still love playing and I feel next update is going to be a good one for end game players with more star point options.
---
they were in a party
---
It’s a joke. Brawl Stars took a year and a half to go global so they’re expecting the same to happen to Rush Wars.
---
i've hit today 12345 trophies, it was hard but boy in hoodie is strong
---

Only these countries. There are some ways to download it in an other country though.
---
Little do they know it's made of Dynamike.
---
Six minutes. six minutes. Six minutes, Slim Shady you're on.
---
I'm using a Canadian iOS account xd
---
Side to side, side side to side
---
When they made BULL and DARRYL Invincible to knockback and stuns while using their supers, i think mortis was unintentionally affected
---
V***p***n
---
Layer Cake Bounty entered the chat
---
curve ball
---
Seriously? After 5 million outros?
---
THE NEGACHIN!
---
I guess you could say it is a copycat
---
Pam mamas hug
---
Mamas sqeeze suxs
---
forgive me lord for what I'm about to do
---
Tickers
---
Yeah, he deals twice damage for some reason
---
I like it because I need to aim my super straight from up to down to make Barley's super go max range
---
Shellys super needs a nerf. Its just unfair. 3 shots and bam her super is on.
---
Poco deals twice damage at Carl
---
I feel like these will be broken
---
Mortis carries
---
Cool 👍🏻 Insane 16 is the highest I think, and Shelly is an “okay” brawler till Insane 3 or 4, after that it’s difficult and she becomes useless
---
I prefer to remain anonymous ;D
---
Barley then trys to save him
---
I think you meant the luck to get the sp you like
---
Until it is too late
---
No it’s a jojo reference
---
Eyes, eyes eyes
---
What is this rush wars thing?
---
It should be in profile edit so people know if your good or not
---
WoW
---
Yes rosa
---
Thats a chance it could also be on the 28th or in early September
---
hope to find some diamonds tonight
---
A new supercell game coming out soon (not globally)
---
I mean...the Mortis moving in front of him kind of forced him to kick it towards the corner.
---
Oh right
---
xD Funny
---
Got same thing today
---
Night night night night
---
Its like Clash of clans but they say you don't have to wait for upgrades and training
---
At least it’s different than most map which are just Piper maps 🤢
---
Sure it does!

casual mode has no trophy?
---
Is there another option ;c
---
I've only ever watched Nickatnyte and Molt because I used to follow their CR content. Maybe I'll check those guys out.
---
Heads up you here a sound
---
Wow, this looks really good.
---
did they deleted this map?
---
I like this idea, maybe perfect it more
---
Unfortunately yes
---
You still teamed...
---
Turn around and look up
---
Total shock fills your body
---
it will never die seriously it haven't even reached 1 year from global release
---
At least you have a legendary, 24 brawlers. Im at 13,3 k without legendaries as a f2p
---
Oh no it's you again
---
I'm guessing that this game would kinda looked like Boom beach, cuz this game was made by Clash royale and Clash of clans
---
You probably have 5k trophies
---
Why ?
---
so close yet so far
---
Secert bonus option (D try to blow it over) or (E post memes on reddit)
---
I can never forget those eyes eyes eyes
---
No I’m at 11k
---
No you are not getting MY point. I'm AGAINST them stopping where they are. Because let's say they shoot if you could keep moving you could save the shot. If you freeze they score. That's why I'm against it. I understand sometimes there are times where it is an open shot you just needed one more second but there are also times where this would harm defense. Could you imagine the meta this would create hold onto the ball until the last second for easy goal.
---
Absolutely incredible, 10/10 worth
---
hahaha so funny and original
---
How did you get bull up i also have both starpowers but stuck at 819- and lower
---
Pls don’t shake
---
Eyes eyes eyes eye cause baby tonight
---
How could you move if the match is over. Explain that
---
The creepers tryna steal all our stuff again
---
I definitely did not get Leon (in his prime) at 400 trophies...
---
Eae mano
---
r/MortisGang wants to know your location
---
Our stuff ag4
---
oh no and don't forget bounty map bull's pen
---
So we back in the mine
---
It happened to me
---
Bruh you didn't know thats it its been noticed for awhile now
---
Crow with extra toxic
---
This colt suck
---
I don't think rush wars will kill brawl stars. Supercell's last few games have all been totally unike, and i expect Rush Wars to be incredibly different from anything we've seen from them.
---
Well, they said this monday will be the soft launch, and they soft launched all their games on the beta countrys, so it will be available for everyone after the global launch, but no one knows how long or if it even goes global, so at monday it'll be available for the beta countrys
---
Bull with tough guy
---
I literally saw bush wars when i first saw the tittle😂
---
Repost
---
When is next brawler coming out?
---
The super area is too big
---
Yet every mortis Auto-Aim's
---
So pretty much airbrush work? Good job!
---
Dude I don’t know if this is a coincidence or not but I think someone stole Shelly and Nita star power ideas I’ll type his name in Endor this post
---
This happen to me today 
---
I'm Stilo playing like as usual
---
No this is great
---
Mice. I’m in Canada

Just when you think you’re safe

Ask google

Oh. I guess that would work. Thanks for replying

The other person can’t talk, so it’s Leon, or spike(unlikely) so probably Leon
---
 I wonder if r/rushwars exist
---
You can also adjust it, in the picture there like sliders to adjust and fix it to your needs
