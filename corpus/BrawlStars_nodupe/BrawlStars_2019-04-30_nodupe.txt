I had one game where I was in duo with a Rosa on my team vs a Carl. Rosa had 22 cubes and a super, Carl had nothing. Carl was destroyed so hard.

Thanks bro

The plant basically has throwers on edge as she's more then capable of landing lunches four five times out of a Bush, and damn she can tank. I use to chase bulls in showdown out of spite, now rosa is the bane of my existence.

I see, piper would be perfect in that map
---
Yea, this is fucking ridiculous. Can't win in brawl ball with her as an opponent. Game last only 20 seconds. Border line thinking of uninstalling.
---
Aw, that's hot (forgive me for I have brought up a dead meme)
---
lol she was afk for the first 20 second too
---
I am havin a nightmare...
---
make her super reduce 100% damage

Yeah, its cute, but give me a valuable reason of why this is worth 150gems but Panda one is 30gems.

Both are furry lolis
---
I would like to see an achievement system or basically medals awarded each season for different trophy levels achieved in seasons, with first place having a swanky black badge. It would push max players to actually do something with their brawlers for a good reward instead of just waiting for a new brawler to push in 2 days.

Okay design, but the pose is what I don‚Äôt like. I do see why people would like it. I made a chart showing what I like and hate about the skin. Click on my profile if you wnat to see it

take away the one tile gaps and it's fine. (no, I'm not changing my opinion because he stole something)

I don't see anything wrong with the matching.

I'm broke so I don't know.

In other news, Mortis is getting nerfed again. Wait actually they are just removing him from the game now!
---
I have spent like hundreds of dollars on the game and yet no legendaries :((( all my friends have them and i have none yet i have the highest level and trophy count by farrr
---
Take some of that OP rosa thicCness and give it to mortis
---
Hmm... The star shape looks familiar...
---
They need to tone down the shield too. If Rosa has super in the beginning of a brawl ball round, it's basically a free point for her team because it's almost impossible to stop her from walking the ball in.
---
Bruh you are unlucky but can I add you tho
---
Well yea and they need to have unique qualities which they do. Rosa has literally everything! Can‚Äôt even run from her cause her range is a bit ridiculous for everything else  she does too.
---
seeing leon's hands are a cursed image

# LIFE LEECH REWORK - GET FREE TROPHIES!
---
(EDIT: You will now regenerate 10 HP every second (a slow regeneration) and healing abilities will be available for healing brawlers!)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
**Introduction:**
---
\- In the beginning of the match, you start with 100% and that's it. There will be a slow unlimited regeneration of 10 HP every second, but you won't heal 100% when defeating brawlers!)
---
\- Any brawlers with healing abilities (Like Pam, MAX Barley, Rosa, etc) are *enabled*, but the effects are reduced!
---
\- Destroying boxes and gaining 1 power cube will slightly increase your health by a little because your maximum health would increase!
---
**BONUS TROPHIES: Kill brawlers and earn trophies!**
---
\- 1 Trophy per defeated brawler you killed! *(Ex: If you defeated 7 brawlers, that's 7 free bonus trophies)*
---
\- These bonus rewards ADDS up to your ranked position when you finish the match!
---
**Life Leech Unlocked - 800 Trophies for Early Players**
---
\- Supercell removed Life Leech mainly because the modifier and its mechanics are confusing for early brawlers!
---
\- Players that reach 800 trophies will be INTRODUCED to the new modifier for showdown (Ladder) *(in a post saying "New Modifier Unlocked: Life Leech and a brief description to explain WHAT the modifier does) .*
---
\- If a showdown map has the life leech modifier attached to it (to get star key), players under 800 trophies will battle with an "alternative modifier", perhaps energy drinks or meteors.
---
**Modifiers for Friendly Battles - Including Life Leech!**
---
\- Early players will be able to experiment with this modifier in friendly matches! This means I'm also requesting for *modifiers for friendly battles as well as bringing back life leech!*
---
\- Modifiers for friendly matches will be unlocked at 0 trophies, even life leech! However, early players that reach 800 trophies will unlock life leech for Showdown ladder!
---
If you have any questions about my post, read my introduction or reply in the comment section.
---
A boat too long.

R/boneappletea
---
Introducing a new brawler to counter another one that's broken doesn't make Rosa balanced, it just means every team now needs that brawler in addition to Rosa.
---
You have all legendaries, what are you complaining about
---
What if they are best friends instead?
---
This definitely takes some time to make and unbullieveablly cute,really deserves more upvotes and I like it.
---
That golden week offer man...
---
agree, brawlstars has turned into a mess. with so many problems showing up everywhere, i wonder how it would be if they listened.
---
Supercell need to make a brawler with mechanic of inferno
---
Looks like Dr. Mario
---
The only one with Rosa in it
---
yea thats probably the main reason. for paladins I spent 40 minutes trying to get a game combined with having to play against ai and then even after that having to play with vegetables until an even higher level I quit
---
Yeah, but still
---
Bulls and Shelly‚Äôs were at least manageable but is this a joke and can someone tell me if it is even possible to beat a team of 3 Rosa in this map
---
Dude, it‚Äôs been a month how far did you scroll down?

he's pretty balanced right now

Wtf no. He's already balanced. He got 3 nerfs already. Just git gud.

It's about fucking time.

Rosa balanced

Make him deal % damage if he‚Äôs attacking a poisoned target.

When I blew out the candles on my birthday cake a few days ago, this is what I wished for....

Thank you for saving your game.

Yep

Yup SC likes to ruin their own game
---
Low trophies matchmaking was kind of broken
---
Good lord yes
---
This was basically already in the game
---
&gt;&gt; üåπRosa balance changes:
---
- Super Shield damage reduction from 80% to 70%
---
- Super Shield duration from 6 seconds to 4 seconds
---
- Fixed a bug with Enemy Rosa's shield effect not being displayed correctly
---
I really wish we could have played robo rumble with the non-nerfed Rosa.
---
I know the wording was shit, i made this at 2am lmao
---
Accurate.
---
"Great" is strong word. Maybe "Good"? I second that what you said!
---
I've been taking to picking Piper and trying to chunk her out before she ever gets close and it seems to be working for the few matches I play rn but I'm still seeing like Power Level 3 Rosas being matched against Level 10 Shellys lol
---
G.G coral was always a tough mapüòÖ
---
LwawL SrarS i LIkE tHem
---
thats actually not true. crow is a decent counter to rosa bc he can do area controll very well
---
Yes, like I said I'll be playing the shit out of her tomorrow. I'm not all that pissed about the nerf, but I am pissed to be in this community rn. All I see is nerf Rosa and hate Siege, instead of "help me, how beat Rosa? How win Siege?".
---
Finally I may enjoy playing the game again.
---
100% Rosas everywhere, chain supers,. In brawl ball she can directly take the ball and goal and it's impossible to stop her if she used her ult. They did a very bad job on balancing this character.
---
Yeah, mortis remodel sucks
---
Hell yeah I send me the link too
---
80% is fine, if she would have 50% she would be a Darryl without mobility. It is also her SUPER not her Star Power, so it‚Äôs fair that she has more shield than Darryl. 
---
I played now some rounds against Rosa and the 2 sec less hits her hard.
---
I think the duration should be increased to 5 seconds. It was a huge nerf...
---
Where did you even get "3k" from?
---
Yea , i fell the same with daryl
---
Has it taken effect yet?
---
Yea I think so
---
Haven‚Äôt gotten her to 500 yet oof
---
still shouldn‚Äôt be that hard i guess
---
What do you mean? They did it literally the first day back to work- she came out Friday &amp; they weren‚Äôt gonna come in over the weekend-
---
But can she hit 2 at people at once ? I'm pretty sure Brock can but not Piper.
---
What‚Äôs the problem that is the whole point of her super, otherwise she would be useless. And if you play now some rounds against her you will see the difference.
---
Thug life
---
I feel same with EVERYONE
---
r/subsifellfor
---
That carl spin to land the return axe was 200 iq
---
OG mortis was the best
---
Same lol waiting for him...
---
Not me, pushed her to 480 and then dropped to 430 cuz randoms
---
no, The highest was about almost 8 minutes. Watch OJ.
---
Rosa drops the ball when hit by a super with displace, like El Primo's or Tara's. That's a decent-ish counter.
---
And its not Boss fight its Big Game.
---
I'm not even sure if it's enough. Definitely not huge.
---
What about her range though? Whenever I am against Rosa I feel I am not in her range. But then it feels like her range is just short to Shelly.
---
Sparky is a girl
---
that was matchmake rig though, but 8 minutes was the max you could get before this decay was introduced
---
That's a really good art for bo... It lookes like inspired from hanzo but still its really tough to pull off something like this.... I appreciate your efforts man!!!
---
And if you could tell what software you are using for creating your masterpieces
---
Not huge? 50% increased damage taken and 33% shorter ult is a gigantic nerf.
---
Does it make a difference tho
---
SS is gonna nerf her again guys don‚Äôt worry 
---
Maybe I‚Äôm the next update 
---
More than the 70% damage reduction 
---
the time reduction it‚Äôs what matters 4 seconds it‚Äôs a really good nerf 
---
She was to good for brawlball üòÇ
---
wow, I really like this map
---
but the lvl 25 is less value
---
Ahahahahahahah. Best meme I ever seen ahahahaha
---
Thank you!

No, it's just another bad Brawl Stars youtube video

Dude if u want to plagiarize can you do it better next time? Like if u want to steal people's posts then at least do it right u dumbass
---
Done forget the Gem cart from Gem grab...
---
I feel bad for darius . Based on his comments the guy is just a kid, maybe in his tweens. Yes, he did some bad shit and he got what he deserved, but this is overkill. Now he can‚Äôt even show his face on this subreddit without being ridiculed and shamed by thousands of people. Hell, there‚Äôs even a subreddit made solely for making fun of him. We‚Äôre better than this. We all probably did something as bad if not worse in the past. It‚Äôs time to let go and move, and, someday, maybe forgive.
---
No

He looks like slender man

Let‚Äôs talk about how power level 4 Rosa does like 75 more damage than a power level 8 elprimo

Your wrong. Grow the fuck up

I pushed her to 400 trophies yesterday instead of mortis so I used my time wisely
---
Cze≈õƒá
---
lucky I have brought her to 500 trophies already:)
---
Just tried her in Gem Grab. *Broken beyond repair*
---
Use Shelly. I‚Äôve been shredding Rosa with her. Shelly‚Äôs super charges almost immediately so you can just keep pumping out supers.

---
I love how hectic this map gets.
---
I am an android beta player. My luck:
---
I only get rares in first month, super rares the two following. Then no new brawler for about 4 months. Then epics and another month of bad luck. Then Mythics (Tara + Mortis) just after global. I unlocked Crow when he got buff (the only luck I had), Carl when he got relased and Rosa a couple of minutes before maintenance update to nerf her. 
---
In my mini account:
---
1st day: El Primo.
---
2nd day: Crow.
---
3rd day: Tara.
---
Then random brawlers (all rarities but no more legends). 
---
Day after I unlock Crow in normal account: Leon.
---
she just destroyed the balance that you probably built up for months.
---
Nah 120%. She heals when she gets hit.
---
More microtransaction
---
Awesome!
---
One of the best ideas to prevent noobs playing with pro players üëçHowever it can be used just to dislike players randomly to get fun ü§î
---
I didn't said it need to. 
---
but do you need to reload a punch?
---
no. 
---
do you need to reload a shovel?
---
no.
---
so reload time buff will be good in the logical way.
---
Only showdown, the maps were good, but for example with shelly i spend many and many hours, max cups 450. With rosa i made from 400 to 500 in 3 hours,
---
Too fucking op, and these nerfs are ridiculous.
---
I thought, maybe at high cups isn‚Äôt so strong; no, it‚Äôs easy like at 100 cups.
---
Japanese 5 year olds..
---
Yup, no reason to have anything above 50% and her damage should be nerfed as well. How the hell are you going to have a tank be a DPS as well? She‚Äôs just so fucking broken that I genuinely don‚Äôt want to see any new characters from them in a while. This was just all done so incredibly stupid.
---
üëç
---
Yeetus yeetus go self deletus
---
His reload speed is slower than most brawlers, and the fact he has to use his own ammo to gap close leaves him vulnerable against most brawlers. He will enter MOST skirmishes with 2 shots, when most brawlers have 3 accessible. Mortis is not tanky, nor does he output nearly as much damage, and his entire kit for sustain is based on being able to build super or kill someone. 
---
I understand where you're coming from, fast brawler op but if a character is shoehorned into one purpose as being like say the one who moves quick to do the objective they still lose out in the long run. Mortis isn't strong enough to contest gems, his brawl ball play got hit pretty hard, he sucks in bounty, showdown you just play the run and hide game. Also heist isn't even worth mentioning for mortis. Comparatively to most brawlers he isn't a threat, I'd sooner take any brawler in the game than have a Mortis on my team or play as him.
---
it is balanced now sir
---
Now and days?
---
Hello! I'm Beetsa's friend apparently he asked me to do bucket head carl :/ I'll do it I tomorrow or today :)
---
Rosa still op
---
Aside from the damage resistance, the 4 seconds is still enough time to keep recharging your super
---
Instant upvote, love the skin idea
---
We should forgive him at least he admitted to stealing the art unlike Darius
---
i knew something was off!
---
thanks for correcting me
---
That would be 220 damage while Rosa has her super
---
Oh yes yo do and it's ROSA!!!!!
---
and Dynamike 2018 after players
---
Repost.
---
#Oh no
---
That‚Äôs the thing even low hp characters can just stop aim 3 attacks and erase him before he can get anywhere near them. When he‚Äôs on the enemy team I just see him as free kills and an easy win
---
I was just making a joke if it applied for all characters but I agree with your point. I was playing Shelly in Bounty and I used my super 3 times in a row to wipe the whole team.
---
Or maybe someone who just knows how game balance works and sees when a character is lacking. Grow up and stop being a sheep

How many trophies u have

How is that an answer

I‚Äôve never heard that , I‚Äôll believe it when I see it.

Lazy fucks

Primo says el primo

Idk why I got platinum its probably because someone thinks mortis needs a buff

go go gadget  AR-15

If you do this for all the brawlers i swear i'll give you all the cookies from my secret vault
---
Go look for it then. You sound like your 12. Not gonna waste half my day looking for ‚Äújustification‚Äù
---
Lmao if people sent me death threats on here I‚Äôd laugh. Tell him to tighten up and stop being sensitive. It‚Äôs reddit
---
Best skin design I‚Äôve seen yet!
---
Well i mean dumb people would let a Rosa charge her super up even past 400 trophies. I play with randoms ik. Plus yea she is more manageable with her nerf
---
Please re reward. I never asked for ‚Äújustification‚Äù I said I‚Äôll believe it when I see it. No need to get angry, ok?
---
Now she's like Shelly. Stay away from her when she has super. Her damage is lower then any close range brawler and not as much health as other tanks. So I think she's good now
---
You broke my guitar!

Pubg is trash, try ring of elysium. But ye brawlstars

I posted this before everyone...

Yea thats right

For the dash range and reload yes, but movement speed no

I wish you many upvotes

I had to use a barbarian from clash royal I haven't even gotten Shelly yet

Truly a creature of the night
---
GET OWNED
---
I tried and lost like 50 the update kind of killed her I think
---
I actually feel pretty bad :/
---
I thought of a 3 reworks, the names I've dubbed are Doubooms, Big Bang, and The Loot Laker
---
Doubooms: When Penny's bag hit a target and split into her doubloons they now have blast damage and after blast (They still contain the Peirce property of attack) they can scatter in a 3 by 3 tile radius.

Big Bang: When Penny's cannon is destroyed it shoots one last Mega Bomb that explodes in a 10 tile radius and deals 2500 damage depending on what your current position is, if the bomb land on you or in a 1-3 tile radius you instantly die no matter the health, 4-7 you take 2500 damage and are stunned for 2-3 seconds and slowed by 75% because of the blast wave or shell shock as a certain syndrome during WWI, or WWII would say, at 8-10 tile radius you take 1000 damage and are briefly stunned by 0.5 second but slow down by 15% and you can be hit by the fragments of the bomb which deal 100 damage, this works similar to meteors and you have a 5 second warning and there are 50 pieces of shrapnel.
---
The Loot Laker: Back on the seas once more, Penny sails her Titanic ship across water, can carry teammates for a quicker and convenient way of travel, has a base health of 8000 can be destroyed and if destroyed you must wait 30 seconds for Penny's trusty crew to build her ship up again, replaces super with a deadly hook that pulls other Brawlers to their impending doom the enemy team can attack the spear to get it off but if fail to do so then that Brawler will be swimming with the fishes, main attack while on The Loot Laker is replaced with SIDE CANNONS this means Penny's ship cannot attack forward and therefore vulnerable, the attacks are middle for cannon shrapnel bomb which main cannon deals 1500 damage and 50 for the shrapnel there are 8 pieces of shrapnel from the blast that works similar to spikes main attack, top and bottom for money shot with a wide spread dealing 800 damage, throws a keg barrel that deals 550 damage on impact and rolls leaving a toxic trail taking 250 damage per 0.25 seconds the trail will be around 2-5 tiles wide, and after attacking 3 times Penny will send one of her trusty crew members to go and join the battle, there are 4 pirates that can be chosen at random, The Blunderbuss, The Swash Buckler's, The General, and Crow's Peak.
---
Blunderbuss: Uses a mid range attack with a range of 5 tiles that deals 560 damage and has 1200 HP movement speed that is less than any Brawler, after 12.5 second he goes back to the ship to stay until the next time.
---
Swash Buckler 1: Sends one from a trio that go and attack with a mid range of 4.3 tiles drenching you in water slowing you down (if you've ever walked with fully wet clothes) by 5% doing no damage area splash with 2500 HP and has movement speed less than all of the Brawlers.
---
Swash Buckler 2: Sends one from a trio with a mop that has a melee range of 3.2 does 315 damage per swing (one second delay on each swipe) HP of 2000 and has a movement speed that's less than all of the Brawlers.
---
Swash Buckler 3: Sends one from a trio which sweeps like Mortis's attack but only moves a quarter of a tile and does 220 damage has 1250 HP and moves at the average Brawler speed.
---
The General: Penny's trusted second in command, he wields a cutlass and revolver, the cutlass does 300 damage and the revolver does 150 damage, has 3000 Hp moves with average Brawler speed and returns to base (ship) after 8.5 seconds, cutlass range 2.5 tiles and revolver range 5 tiles.
---
Crow's Peak: With her spy glass and night vision goggles, Cassi can see any danger from afar, with her signal flair attack she can locate ANY Brawler hiding this includes people hiding in bushes and Leon's invisibility, if Cassi shoots in a bush it reveals a 3x3 tile radius and lasts for 2.5 seconds, however if struck by signal flair it lasts for 5 seconds and makes you visible and the area around you, if Leon is hit and turns invisible or already is he looses his invisibility making his ability useless, Cassi with her night vision goggles she can spot anyone hiding or invisible, her signal flair does 400 damage on impact and 100 damage every 0.5 seconds.

No I didnt

Good one.

True sadly

This sub are just a bunch of low effort memes at this point
---
I see both Rico and Ricochet, I approve. Haha still nice art!
---
My Rosa is 550 at lvl1üòÇ , pushed before Nerf.
---
What about buff spike? She has practically 0 health for a legendary.
---
I agree with other dude. She‚Äôs still super powerful
---
Who are u?
---
Why are we still doing this? It's been a few weeks let this end
---
r/gocommitdie
---
Pushed so many trophies with it.  It‚Äôs so ez and so HILARIOUS playing Gene with that comp.
---
She actually isn't even top 3 anymore. Gene, Tara and Jessie are stronger than her overall. Can you guys stop complaining about Rosa just because you aren't playing around her strength?
---
Imagine quitting an argument because of a misunderstanding about what you said.
---
Matchmaking is random
---
This news have almost 6 hours. Your post has not.
---
It‚Äôs Plants vs zombies and Brawl Stars cross over XD
---
What did it say?
---
today i played rosa once again (in snake prairie): me as a power 1 rosa with 2 teammates power 6 and 7 against a similar team. i ended up becoming star player. 
---
same stuff happens in brawl ball where the power 1 rosa (me) always ends up getting star player while donutting infront of the enemy goal while being under attack from 3 brawlers
---
First after the 98% of the playerbase
---
Sure :)   Not OP :)   Good job, btw.
---
by list I meant chart
---
Why
---
cursed_brawl
---
You‚Äôre incoherent
---
I dont have her either
---
The fact that her super gets charged while being in use is the biggest problem with her.
---
Terminator bull
---
Thanks i look more dumb now
---
Define 'Ugh' yes or no?
---
Same I got like 41 coins and most of my brawlers need upgrades
---
The botles also hit in impact. It's way harder to dodge than the dynamite.
---
They can also just increase his range and his speed when dashing
---
What game mode?
---
This
---
She‚Äôs still broken
---
Nerf her by removing her super
---
Even with the nerf she‚Äôs still incredibly overpowered, now she‚Äôs just not the best character in every gamemode
---
They think its enough?
---
And I thought the battle would be longer than Endgame
---
how
---
Rosa is useless without her super
---
Letarlly the only reason I upvoted.
---
The grave says UOU
---
NO 
---
he's an assassin not a sharpshooter, he's already great at close range
---
I found Shelly to be really effective in that event because her super can stop the boss from charging or shooting
---
We don't want her being the focal point of brawl stars, she's broken. Even more than leon was, and he got nerfed to oblivion
---
A bush camper that needs the bush as life support when lvl 10
---
Molto bella
---
Can‚Äôt, probably just a picture someone sent to him
---
It can be a picture someone sent him
---
Sure i do that, its really obvious. I mean, are you stupid enough to think that supercell wrote this?
---
Mortis gang
---
So two Rosa and one Shelly, or two Shelly and one Rosa, could be an effective team.
---
thats like having a dictionary with 2 words and calling it a ‚Äúfunctional dictionary‚Äù

\#Furious Doge?!?!
---
There‚Äôs someone at my school who plays Inkling, and he spams Roller, and I punish it every single time. Online? Not so easy.
---
You‚Äôd also need a colt or a long range brawler to deal with the robot snipers
---
su tart is on your side, brother
---
None of these characters are maxed and do not appear to be over 300 trophies.  There is no way for the crows to beat Rosa in such tight quarters especially when she has more power cubes and her super.  Crow is stronger now but he is not OP and still just as squishy.
---
It's a screenshot. R u plagiarising?
---
Just activate her super and walk into the opponents goal
---
&gt;applaud my supreme originality
---

A little dirty

( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

Maybe make it so you have to get 2 wins in a row for the buffer to go away so you don‚Äôt just win one match then keep dropping
---
It was more about the colt than the piper but yeah rosa needs a super charge nerf esp when she can chain supersü§Æ
---
when were you when nerf rosa?
---
i was sat in bush with bull when surpecell ring
---
‚Äòrosa is nerf‚Äô
---
‚Äòyes‚Äô
---
5/10 no thong
---
Absolutely right
---
Oh this? Heh heh well might as well uh * snap * oh wow now it's gone
---
nice work
---
I appreciate the Words sirüôèüôèüòÇ
---
I pushed her today from 0 to 400 trophies. She's only level 1. She still needs to be nerfed.
---
Why would people quit because theres a new cool brawler, like wtf
---
If I were that cat i couldn't see myself
---
Best thing to do is make her use her shield the book it away for it to run out then rush her when her shield is down
---
Wow gotta admit these look cool
---
Now can you Rosa pickers stop being in every game I play? Thank you!
---
Wtf is that
---
I'm sorry but I need to be family friendly
---
Yeah i agree; it always feels too short because in a real battle people would be moving around and running away, especially the latter, so mortis needs to use more dashes to close the distance, often leaving not enough left to kill the enemy brawler.
---
Mate it's a mobile game, it's not tekken or sum other type of fighting games, there's not that much of a skill cap and it just means you grind for trophies nonstop not how good you are at a mobile game. And also I could also say I'm top 300 but where's the proof even?

Who was Ricardo?

Rosa in bushes with super??

As I said it's a mobile game and it's not that hard and if your having trouble getting close you must be trash.
---
I‚Äôm still winning with her, the nerf didn‚Äôt make a huge difference tbh.
---
1.2k trophies on Rosa
---
Wow it looks very great :)
---
Replay works only for that particular brawler. Even if you tilt under 400 after breaking it, I believe replays are still available.
---
Removed - You have a negative karma score, please fix this before posting again. This action is to prevent spam on the subreddit.
---
Except, hmm, she has much better range than those two, her damage is consistent (as long as it hits you, it hits you the same in every scenario and pierces. She is much closer to a Nita or primo in her way of dealing damage, and she can survive much longer than any brawler. Her DPS is not only great but she can sustain it on much longer duration.
---
I'd love to see your profile to see how full of shit you are.
---
Thanks :)
---
I smell a great skin
---
Why my pp aard?
---
or a massive move speed buff. why do you even need to reload a shovel?
---
If they do put it in the game i will uninstall brawl stars
---
What? You are 100% in the wrong.
---
I swear there's always at least one person who boast in this kind of comment section üòÇ
---
Not much better range and she‚Äôs got less range than darryl so
---
Maybe 4 AHAHAHH
---
I pushed her 500 Sunday at the expense of cracking my phone screen, worth it
---
What do you mean before buff he was weak before buff
---
https://imgur.com/a/g0CK8dm
---
You're up.
---
openis
---
Yeah I figured that out. Me and Piper teamed up for a few rounds playing Bounty, and Piper easily killed Rosa with close range. 
---
I don‚Äôt know if it is because she was nerfed, but she is actually very easy to kill.
---
They literaly JUST nerfed her.
---
These three I did like in 3 min, so the legs are ALMOST perfect ;)
---
Im not rude im just pointing out the truth
---
yep, i untilted most of the trophies but i was mad so i took a screenshot
---
Yes they are. And he doesnt have to have 400 trophy brawler. Its enough that one of the players (even on opponent side) have 400 or over and he can replay the game. Just no pause or rewind.
---
Guess they found out how long I was Big Brawler with her.
---
And also brock,rico,tara,gene,crow,spike,pam and sometimes even frank. Also throwers are also really food against rosa...
---
Bushes do not affect the instantaneous damage you need to do to kill Rosa.
---
My point is that those brawlers who also have pretty decent mobility with the use of their supers also have a good main attack. Mortis is close to useless once he‚Äôs out of ammo slots and you usually have to use most of them to even get up close to the enemy
---
dude weird flex but ur SO cool
---
yea yea for sure , in the final , mortis needs a buff .
---
im glad too. i realised that i may win with an unfair advantage but would not feel victorious in the end , so i didn't want this to be the way i get my first rank 20.  
---
#stopthespin
---
i‚Äôm just saying that what he sad is dumb, this game is not pay to win

I'm sorry if you put the hard work and made it yourself but I was one similar last week with a few k upvotes

i know
---
ü§£ü§£
---
I didn't know that it is a mouse
---
Unfortunately 4 rosa players she isn't anymore
---
I feel like it's still not close to enough. She'll be nerfed a few more times in the future.
---
hey if getting to 300+ trophies with one character on a videogame gives you validation in life for whatever reason be my guest
---
Now that I agree with you. Also I agree on a mortis reload speed buff because he really reloads too slow. He needs attack to kill but Also to engage and escape.
---
World Class, excellent finish.
---
i didn‚Äôt say that lol
---
Na ahah ahaha Jk yes
---
lucky i got her to 520 maybe more but i‚Äôll try to push her more if I can lmao
---
Have you pushed any of your brawlers to 500?

she‚Äôs bad on this map

That‚Äôs all you have to say? About my entire comment..? Seems like youre just selecting little bits to reply to and ignoring the rest. Pretty pathetic if you ask me
---
i didn‚Äôt say it gives me validation in life it‚Äôs just that the other guy is retarded just like you
---
No thongs on my good Christian server /s
---
This is eBic
---
I agree all my brawlers are 400+ with power 5-7 and 11 of them are at 500
---
I get it.
---
Dem hair tho
---
Mortis coz you don‚Äôt have him lol I know you picked because this was probs posted after you picked üôè
---
post this on twitter and tag frank.. he usually replies
---
I am at 5.4k and with and I'm rank 15 with Leon (330 trophies exactly)
---
I pushed my jessie to rank 20 by playing siege with randoms, the only problem is crow is only good in sd (or maybe sneak prairie). Hope you can still push him
---
r/lootstars

SAKURA-CHAN &gt;~&lt;

Literally incredible... I shall congratulate you since you credited the original artist! :)

Yes and he was op now he is skill brawler you need to leart to play whit that range. And not auto aim
---
bro you‚Äôre the one flexing on a fucking subreddit how good you are at an app that literally is nothing but a fucking time waster. some people are better at games than others, no need to slap your dick in other people‚Äôs faces for literally no fucking reason whatsoever
---
Me but at over 8K
---
Dynamikes. Btw flair checks out.
---
Yes, Jessie in siege cause in showdown I would often face teams of 5, I even faced a team of 8 caching me down.
---
i love how angry you are lol
---
Cause of stress: RANDOMS
---
No it's not.
---
Yea rosa‚Äôs reticle is misaligned (a little too close to her)
---
I'm still working at finding new things that have an hp and you can look at my profile to see how it was going.

Pardon the fuck?

Man,i wanted it to be reduced to 55% at very least. Shes still inmortal.

Bull actually has a bigger range than Rosa,but he doesn't hit all the shells.

That was sony
---
I agree, crow didnt even need a buff lol
---
Someone lead me to the patch notes or official news of the nerf and I'll give you gold
---
Some people didn‚Äôt get the memo and even then some maps favor Rosa.
---
Maybe you should take more than five seconds to respond and get a vocabulary larger than a Neanderthal‚Äôs.
---
Why would there be a touchscreen on a flip phone? What the point of the keyboard?
---
I tried but it sent me to reddit BS community...I don't want to share it...I want to send it as private message...
---
So you are a 3v3 main...
---
Right before the crow part i was like oh shit its leon lol
---
I got her now rank 18 and 430 trophies "BIG FACEPALM"
---
absolutely absurd, how you think that f2p would have enough power points, to level brawlers up to 9.
---
What he need?
---
poor mortis...
---
But where's the Fun in this?
---
Nothing in my chest btw!
---
OP said "just need to escape" even if you don't get the kill, this provides a solution for OP's complaint.
---
Reminds me of that one Poco that uses super to try to kill a Shelly with low HP
---
minumap thing just wont work, its new but too new
---
Anyone else still haven't pulled her
---
I was just about to comment the same
---
ADD THIS NOW
---
shes mentally preparing herself for standing on one leg for so long
---
He needs farther bush vision too because I don‚Äôt want to keep diving into camping bulls in showdown and get 3 tapped
---
Shut up and take my gems
---
Just remove shelly lol. So annoying brawler and its so overused. I hate it, everyone is saying she needs a buff but she rekts everyone already. Imo she should be either reworked or removed becuase I cant explain you how much I hate that brawler...And also I have no idea why in beta she couldnt super stack that fast as you can now. And thats whats broken about her. Her super charge rate and stacking. Pls supercell either rework shelly (to remove her was a joke btw), and by that way mortis would become stronger, not needing a buff.
---
RIN NOOOO
---
Upvote carefully, he's a hero

I think it‚Äôs hard to buff mortis because if you give him: 
---
1. faster reload=too fast
---
2. longer range=too fast
---
3. more damage=op if too much. useless if to little
---
4. more health=makes him able to run around (even easier that usual) until gettin 1st or 2nd place
---
Looks cool
---
Well, depends. Wanna spin?

Bro, how i put the leon after my name here on Reddit?
---
No, this isnt true, I think. Im Positive. You know what, it may be. Alright You want sum TNT or what!?
---
Im working on it but its an illusion,there is not that much grass,the walls are green.
---
Rarity has nothing to do with how good they are. Barley/Nita/Jessie/Brock are top tier brawlers. Carl/Pam are better than the legendaries.
---
I think not
---
exactly, probably best brawler in showdown.
---
A lvl 1 Rosa can still beat a lvl 10 El Primo any day
---
I'm so fucking trash that my Rosa is only a rank ten
---
Ikr
---
Okay, he hits you once dealing low damage and then dashes away. He wouldn‚Äôt be much of a problem then...
---
darryl shouldn't need a buff and shelly needs one.
---
This confirms that poco is bald lol

Oh so yall against my species now.. *VISUAL DISAPPOINTMENT*

It's nice and simple

---
Carl better than leon crow and spike? Ok
---
Then why making legendaries with low drop rate if rare brawlers are better ?
---
Good map but maybe it would be useful to be able to shoot the middle from the side bushes (Just a small opening), because brawlers like Jessie can dominate in the middle.
---
Wow that‚Äôs funny üòÇ
---
dynamike need a nerf then
---
ThxüòÅ

You're gonna have a really bad time

do you mean buff shelly?
---
Even Speedwagon is thankful!

Its your wifi.

Confused.

üòÇ it‚Äôs okay
---
I think that you can actually press super, then right afterwards pick up the ball and it will kick it anyway and waste your super
---
Just hope that their is no 'Wanna Team' text lmao

maybe people wouldnt compare you 2 gedi kor if u didnt rip off his template

I'd almost change his star power to decrease his detection range in bushes down to 2 tiles and eliminate detection at all unless damaged when using super either that or let his super charge a little quicker from Long range

They should just give mortis an extra ammo slot. They already broke their rules with Carl
