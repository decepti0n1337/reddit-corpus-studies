it's cow

I know. They could’ve made Rosa a completely new type of support brawler,but no, we need another basic tank.
---
Kid el primo and kid Rosa
---
Scrappy has low range tho
---
Im sugar and spice
---
And?
---
I see Pam With her *Pokerface*
---
Uh.. I don't see your point?
---
They should give him 20 sec super
---
And 0 sec
---
Woah woah woah, hold up, who said she had boobs? /s
---
i had noticed that too!
---
I hope Supercell Don't forget Pin Hair
---
So the umbrella is amazing but there really isn’t much else changed
---
so in a hypothetical case where the guy who appears in the recently released trailer is indeed a new playable character, it will most likely be an epic, right
---
hold up
---
You meant 1.2k
---
With these "meme" templates, weeb art. Like why isn't there a sub reddit for these things itself. This should be about posts of the game where things are actually important
---
you figured it out?
---
His face looks like he's Interested in Blowing Colts face
---
Consider yourself lucky, last time i won without doing nothing in duos was when brawlstars went global

It has to do with your total trophies

Look at his ear. It looks nothing like Mortis.

A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.

She uses her baseball and bashes cars with it like real bikers do (in game she bashes enemies).

Yea

No, my tag is \#2JVGC2GR if you wanna check brawlstats.com for proof
---
__Why did you do this?__
---
I was extremely bored
---
__Are you an idiot for doing this?__
---
Most likely, yes
---
CASEY.
---
Terrible option. There’s one map where she’s ok with a good team comp. She’s horrid on defense. Awful choice on siege. If you bring piper, you might be the bad random.
---
LeeSin.exe
---
Move down Pam and spike, mortis gotta be s tier.
---
Gene after a weekend in grandma's house
---
Yeah ik my village is masacred I hadn't played in months
---
Piper is literally one of the worst picks in siege. If you played a “certain character with advantages” then you would have been better off.
---
oh nvm, i see you slightly edited and changed the color of some of the original files
---
#GONNA PUNCH IT
---
He does minimal damage with a crowbar but has a fast-loading brawl meter, with a devastating attack with gas grenades.
---
And u dont think it's a skin?
---
OMG, this is so cute! Love it!
---
Guys look the bull has low trophies instead of high haha
---
Bro. Keep it PG I need to get monetized. Never say handle
---
ok
---
#MOO MOO
---
lol. most girls reading this. their reaction is: ??? wtf
---
That's how rosa awakens her shield powers.. when primo slaps the spike
---
Foda ! Como sempre mano
---
Because you are lying...
---
Use brawlers you haven't used before it's easier to gain trophies on lower trophy brawlers
---
His smile reminds me of something 
---
D D D^ A G# G F D F G
---
#its sans ok
---
She’s honestly the only bad option. Everyone else has viability on siege. Even Poco. I see piper on the other team, I start counting my trophies. See her on my team, I prepare for the tilt.
---
really?
---
No. Kid, read the rules.
---
Nobody:
---
This guy: Im about to tilt
---
Am I the only one who doesnt see a difference?
---
Yes
---
RED XIII nope i forget the other guys name
---
It might work
---
Yeah, but especially Sparring Match, she doesn’t do so well, only during late game I’d say. Also, playing brawlers who are meta or if they are one of the best for the map will definitely help.
---
It is 100% impossible they add it to the game...
---
Agreed! Thanks bro😉
---
The guy in the shadow is Colt, boiiiii.
---
"That's robophobic!"
---
 yes, these are inside the game files. he just took them and edited them slightly. ;)
---
Yeah easy to use ur mamas credit card for that star power
---
ok Wtf
---
Or sleeping kirby.
---
girl*.... i think
---
I posted colt and will do Jessie next
---
No one cares
---
25$ won't give you a legendary they are 499 not 440.

That’s crow

nah make it 20 minutes

My favorite skin so far amazing !!!!
---
its cool and all but ismt really defining or special and looks similar to another map try making one more unique
---
What's annoying is that if the bot plays for you and you win, you get no trophies, but if u lose, you lose them
---
Lol what, you dont need to spend money to get star power. I have 2 brawlers with SP which I obtained from normal box. 1% chance is quite high.
---
Everyone knows bout this.
---
how does he attack?
---
Mines only .1632😢
---
He shoots a sound wave with her moo
---
We’ve all been that guy.
---
You meant 1.3k
---
Actually I take what I said back. It’s not the star power but just getting to power 10 takes a lot of time IF your not a maxed account, but you’re most likely pretty maxed so yeah
---
r/brockkgang wants that thicc booty
---
I want crowwwww so badddd😥😥😥😥😥😥😭😭😭😭😭
---
And her super is that she squirts milk on her enemies slowing them down n making them visible in bushes for 3 sec
---
Builder dies.....
---
Looks like Crow lmaoo
---
And dynamike is like pharah if you think about it.
---
Pharah fires explosives, and dynamike throws explosives, both pharah and dynamike have abilities that repels them (dynamike has his star power that only repels him and pharah has an ability that repels both her and an enemy.)
---
She can come and nerf this d!&lt;{
---
Guessing u bought the gems.
---
Replace the second part with you have an uno reverse card in your pocket

Nerf auto aim buff mortis

it's all cool! i was just a little irritated, i guess. thanks for intervening!

Yeah I noticed that too.

Tara is tornado

Jessie is electro dragon
---
So does Saturday
---
It’s majestic
---
There is the possibility that they maxed shelly to 9, left her untouched a while, then got the star out of a chest and decided to push her
---
That's what I did with a few other brawlers I struggled to push without the star like Colt
---
He let the other team win in bounty by letting them kill him the entire match 😡
---
Okay

You thought there was a power box here but it was I ! ROSA

Ohhh my- she only came out briefly and now we are getting new fanart!!

We have officially devolved from high quality meme to anything that has penis that is related to brawlstars

I bet you 1000 rubox that its a female

OMEGA WHAT!

Probably today
---
How do you set spike icon behind the name

*cries in heavy weight*
---
moaning owo
---
I don’t recall seeing where I admitted I’m wrong. I more than supported my piper is trash argument. Your argument is saying you need 2 teammates to carry her garbage ass in brawl ball. Lemme guess. Your piper is under rank 15 where you can literally bring anyone to any mode and if you have half a brain(which I’m not sure you do) and you’ll win more than lose. There’s a reason at rank 20, where all my brawlers, you almost never see piper in brawl ball. It’s because she’s trash.
---
His name might actually be Simon! Someone commented in Twitter and Brawl Stars replied!
---
Blessed image
---
Mines better
---
That's the reason why there is *ROCKET RAINNNN* Form the sky

Why more mele brawlers😤

Nice artwork. But... It's the same thing.

She looked underweight. Now she is definitely huggable.

Leon is better against ranged brawlers.
---
Crow is better against tanks.

that’s bull

I’m gonna make a new one today with another brawler
---
But Spike doesn't have bones his kinda okay
---
Brick taught me some things too;) r/brockkgang
---
This is why I sort by new
---
hmmm. Crow and Human made cactus🤔
---
Not bad brawler skin mashups
---
She looks feminine tbh
---
share a video showing she won it will be like 1 in a million
---
It would be cool Brawl Stars to have an event once with a gamemode that would be just like Clash Royale but without decks, you just pick a Brawler, play, respawn and destroy the towers.
---
People:P2W
---
I got leon just because he is really fun and i enjoy him seen as they are both strong
---
Frank noticed you. Congrats! https://twitter.com/Frank_Supercell/status/1130016338322305024?s=09

Its u gedi kor he is not the kid LMAO/s

i only needed to spend $25 because i has some gems already.

leon

Crowww
---
*rolling noises*
---
What?
---
I know.Her ear ring totaly gave away her gender.....for some people.Others haven't got a clue.😅
---
Do you have him?
---
Yeah his double nerf made wonder what's even the POINT of having "Legendary" as a brawler type. I get that all brawlers should be created equally so that skills is what counts but if they are going to make a group called Legendary they should be stronger than normal brawlers. Might be a bit P2W but whatever games aren't charities lol
---
I dunno I just miss feeling like I had a leg up on others by having all 3 legendaries. Now I just have a thinner wallet!
---
Agree
---
r/crow gang

if people started using this meme “correctly” only people who have seen the movie will think it makes sense

You need to be senior and over (I think). Tap on the profile and tap on kick.

He’s creating Jessie (and most likely colt) with pam

Jeez it is just a joke these gangs let people promote a sub if it is connected to brawl stars

Or is it *uno reverse card*

If you you're the candy this creature of the night is down

I can afford one of the special offers but really can’t decide between Leon and Spike...
---
...why would you share one account on multiple platforms? It's a good excuse to have in case something goes wrong but otherwise what's the benefit? :)
---
Lmao chairs are hammers too guys!
---
Thx
---
The idea sounds good but on paper it could be exploided alot mostly on high trophy matches.
---
0|{ /\y
---
Leon always gets needed but you can fake his super. I've seen it in my own games.
---
Damnn boi he thicc
---
This is the cheapest they've gotten. If you can't afford it then stop crying about it. I can't afford it and im not crying. (Cries in the shower) totally fine

Shut up r/crowgang

My bad. Nice-r/brockkgang

What's the thought process?

FINALLYYYYYYYYYYY

seriously?
---
Mortis is too map and brawler dependent, i cant play most of the showdown maps as its a place where most mortis counters strive,i mostly trophy push in brawl ball and even there i need a good comp and good randoms

I don't know, he is green nita, he would become nita green nita...... Just kidding I like it😂

The other time there were a pam in the opposite team who just took the ball and went right in their own goal. Twice.

Best thing I've seen in a while. On one hand, it's funny af but on the other, it's saddening as the subreddit has become really bad now.

Yes but does it lag the same to you?

I don't play on it

---
I’d say Spike. He’s truly fun to play. Well, actually that applies for the 3 of them, but as a r/spikegang mod I am, it is my duty to recommend you this xD. Now seriously, if your decision is because of game mode playability, I’d think it according to this criteria (with brief gameplay descriptions):
---
Spike: if you enjoy BB, sometimes Siege, Gem Grab and Duo SD. Not so mobile, but bursty and really satisfactory gameplay when using good ults, kinda feels like basketball for me sometimes 😂. If any doubts, come by our subreddit ;)
---
Crow: if you enjoy Solo and Duo SD, Bounty and occasionally a really team-depending Gem Grab or BB. If you like a poisonous, erosion-like DPS and bullying gameplay, being really mobile at the same time.
---
Leon: if you enjoy Solo SD, Bounty, certain Gem Grab maps, and BB (when having Star Power you can run pretty fast with the ball xD). Don’t have him, but as far as I have tried in some friends’ accounts it is just like the name he’s given: a stealthy and pretty fuckin surprising assassin when used properly. You can also use the fidgets for poke, not just for those bursty and again, satisfsctory takedowns with some sweet backstabs.
---
Hope this helps you decide!
---
Just dont ho to match if its on your screen 24/7
---
I hate those people leaving comments saying this particular game (CoC) is desd amd Pubg is the best. Like then what the hell are you doing following this page for just leave
---
Hopefully.... I wish it was today!

Dynamike sucks and it is delicious for Mortises (I do not eat dynas I am just a green hoodie kid)

Yeah totally but we won so i guess its cool :p
---
The person who sings the song is called bibi
---
Just wait,I really think that we will have a BrawlTalk today
---
Thanks a lot!
---
About spike: not bounty tho, and Solo SD would cause you struggle sometimes unless you got SP (at least in my case, now that I’ve got him @ 420 trophies and lvl 10). But he’d be my choice as well, yes (flair checks out).
---
Ikr
---
Why do you think that?
---
If you look at the picture above, Brawl Stars has 27 videos. 
---
But if you count the videos on BS youtube channel, there are only 26 videos.
---
Conclusion:
---
They are either working on Brawl Talk, or already posted it, but hiding it from public view
---
Sorry, I meant the Brawl Talk, not the update

O hell no😂😂

Actually, now that I think about it, I we’re missing an epic in the pattern, so we’ll probably get an epic in the next update and a legendary in the update after that

I have got 9900 trophies and no legendary :(

*no one cares picture*

Dynamike!

Too bad she later clones and muders that spike for her gloves

Lucky you, I’m at 8.6k missing a mythic and all legendaries, and the odds of me getting a legendary is currently 0.0816%... Looks like I’ll have to wait for a while ;-;
---
Lol.
---
hello gang
---
We need more mods
---
I would do half of that to get Mortis
---
Please
---
That is true but she a hillbilly
---
I upvote you anyways.... But you should also remember that supercell has mere 300 members ... And only 60 of them work in brawl stars... So you should wait little because the way they are introducing new things is probably the best way I can ever imagine...
---
Well i mean lex says pheonix like penis cant disagree there
---
No, this skin is better then mortis
---
Why Nerf Leon if you can Nerf Rosa? (I made her rank 15 even after the Nerf and i have her only level 4. This is a problem)
---
Yesssss they need to change poco’s icon
---
You just countered yourself. Congratulations

lol i got my first legendary at 9k

I wish we could trade. The creature of night eludes me

I can't tell what is happening.Can you tell me?

I don’t think bo should be up there but apart from that I agree

am i a only person who likes siege?

Keep going

Who is clusterbo and whirlwind
---
They will literally remove him evenutally
---
Oh no, they’re gonna change the language of the game!
---
Why is 2 cooaach cory here?
---
Frank is **the team lead**
---
Supercell: More legendary offer=More unfairness=More p2ws=More money
---
I'm at 9k and I don't have a legendary
---
Excuse me wtf
---
Bo is the Archer queen since Mortis is the Night Witch
---
They definitely need to
---
Is this a skin concept?
---
I sub and then unsubscribe
---
In that case barley should now be the same as brock

I didnt when i was a kid because i wasnt interested/didnt care for guns 😂 😂

Carl the Cutest!

I'm sure its for humor in a way no?
---
Although he got a remodel he deserves too ;-;
---
They cost a Star and a trip to Walmart.
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Well that is why Brawl Stars community is much more efficient and will last longer. Fortnite’s community is so erratic and fickle and many of the OG players don’t enjoy it anymore because they took the simplicity out of the game and listen to all the new players so they can make money. Also, the 7-year old TTV kids love to spray-and-pray and then have the guts to be toxic about it, and look what gun the community chose to come back! The gun that broke the game in the first place. Brawl Stars doesn’t care to please everyone, but works to make the game enjoyable and balanced while staying true to themselves.
---
It's an example, random pics of cool skins for toons that have none as opposed to the skins that were revealed for toons that have multiple skins already
---
Relateable

You’re Right

Downvote this comment
---
Broke and beyond repair as Jessie says
---
Can we please be grateful for once?
---
This skin is weird his(i guess it now) eye is not happy.
---
Ohh I forgot that they added Carl ”recently”. Idk than, by counting next should be mystic imo, but who knows, on the other hand, keeping amount of legends=mistic=super rare=rare would be ridiculous, mystics are so much harder to get, maybe there should be less of them than super rares or so.
---
Needed 2$ to get Leon.
---
0$ to get the other two.
---
Wow
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
They did look at our sub Reddit. I saw the maps.😐😐😐
---
Yes.  Played her now, and oh boo just OP AF she is... Anyway how u rate this SP out of 10
---
I don’t even play siege, I just don’t get the star token because it’s not worth the -30000 trophies
---
Thanks for this, i really look forward to a moment like that lol, it better be soon since im bored of all my current brawlers now and they are almost all above rank 15

Oh so he's cheating on pam
---
Yeah I still go on big lose streaks sometimes with randoms but if that happens I’d try switching brawlers and event or just stop playing for a little while to clear my head
---
Im at 5.500 and missing 2 epics 2 mitychs and no leggies
---
Well, i will see how long it takes for me to get lucky and get some good new brawlers
---
Well, at the same time they only have 55 users
---
You're Luigi?
---
Correct, those two have the highest amount of skins in the game, if bought all. And Tara, Bo, leon having no skins at all.
---
franks response was pretty childish, "no clue who you are" and "go play another game" seriously? he sounds like a 10 yo

Why 7 .. LOL

Oh yes, definitely, either trophy or epic (forgot about this rarity)

Eyyy.... Bro...

I think bibi depending on her damage she will be balanced as an suport brawler (also the super is unknow)

Hi :) If you're interested to know my process, I'm actually working on a speedpaint video. Not yet uploaded but I'll post it maybe on twitter and fb once it's done :) So perhaps you'd like to follow me on that platform.
---
I don't think I'll post videos here because this isn't a community focused on art. It's all about Brawl Stars. People would be more interested in the final product :)

Less than 1 percent of people are at endgame

Looks like he won’t be giving a damn about anything.
---
There are many things not announced
---
yea, why is frank acting like a 5 yo, they need better community managers
---
It's in brawl talk
---
Great job
---
It's out
---
Hair reminds me of Josuke...
---
Man I love poco 🎼
---
I know that because I watched the brawl talk,why do you post it when brawl stars official channel made a video about it
---
#buffmortis
---
There is a lot of things that were not announced in the brawltalk.
---
Barley got 2 skins
---
On a serious note her super can be abused in maps even like brawlball but she’s deadliest in heist. I mean it took my Rico’s super to kill her turret while she was healing it. 2.4k hp heal in two shots. Can’t even land all my hits because I have to dodge hers bouncing of the turret. 8/10 SP
---
\*ruins some random kid's birthday party\*
---
Tormund barley throwing giant's milk lol
---
Do you mean Piper instead of Jessie?
---
Damon role
---
Neat recreation.
---
yea not at all, why is he community manager again? i havent seen him do one helpful thing
---
Make a better skin and then talk,oh not a 2d skin but a 3d
---
Yeah. I don’t think they should add another legendary or mythic because no ones going to be able to use them. I’d rather have 5 rares and 3 legendaries than 4 of each.
---
I don't really know, my cousin did that
---
I mean in certain situations it makes sense, if the post is related to the sub
---
But that shit is lame
---
And other questions?
---
Hmm let me check
---
I think they are doing that on purpose. This way skins for those chars get "powercrept" *and* you are more inclined to buy any skin for chars that don't have them yet - even if they are bad.
---
Yea, new barley is kinda cute tho. NW mortis is pretty horrifying
---
Leaving and Lagging are 2 different things.
---
AND LEON
---
Supercell: sry i can't hear you i have to much money in my ears

Tara: Am a joke for real🤧😭

Step 1: Acquire Bibi        Step 2: Push to 500 in 2 days before they nerf her
---
Supercell: New skin for Carl, Brock and Barley!
---
Tara: Am I a joke to you?
---
She has no super she has a perk
---
haha, it actually reads as PAIPER in Russian.П as P, Й as I and P as R.
---
Reee
---
Play solos
---
(Replaces frank with bull)
---
The skin of canada is excluive for canada?
---
Hope it's not 150 gem skin if it's 30 i will buy it but if it's 80 i will have some time saving gems
---

---
Lol you're just bad
---
Frank is a cool guy, and I agree that probert asked in an assholish way.
---
Also happy cake day.

Because the X is the middle of the map x)
---
Have you ever heard of randoms
---
I want to see Russian Nita
---
Exactly, that’s how they’re so successful; thousands of employees working overtime for constant never ending updates. The updating in BS is slow, but it’s basically as fast they can go with their small team
---
What did they do this time?
---
Looks fun  !
---
This is a 1970s themed update, so I think a Barley Boss is not something for that time
---
For context for newer players, PRobert was ex. #1 global many times, but wasn't a very popular player since he constantly lashed out at opponents and was very toxic. He had a YouTube channel with amazing gameplay but his commentary made it not enjoyable to watch.
---
Okay, that makes sense. Then they have to move the walls to make it “back to normal”
---
OmG hE gOt El PrImO
---
Then maybe make a team? Not that hard you know.
---
Maple Barley makes up for it
---
How can you flex getting top 100 when that doesn’t mean anything. It doesn’t show your skill, right
---
Took me a while to understand what You said but Now I see the words
---
Kinda is when nobody plays
---
See Brawl Talk
---
They want to kill us
---
Thanks!
---
Why are you so toxic i can use the format however i want !
---
How did you figure out her star power? It’s hard to tell what it is to me
---
If you dont like my opinion,  don't comment here
---
Thank you for telling us what we already know
---
A mustache and a blond long hair supercell please dont think like like animals except if you are
---
You forgot •Leon Nerf (I know theres balance changes)
---
10-14 people online at the time you took this picture. Im not a dumbass.
---
Remember TF2 scout? So this is his gf
---
I don’t see it, please explain
---
He's a robot...does it matter? Mustache and girl clothes, i don't think robots give a crap. 
---
Mortis on the other hand...
---
Most of my wins are 3v3 but SD is mostly for my trophie pushes and It feels more awarding winning all by yourself

Brawl stats is really good.
---
Season pass!?!?!?! STFU.
---
This is new brawler Bibi she is girl.
---
Bo*
---
Lucile
---
Really? Think about how they are usually played both have a set up to play defensively till they get their super wait for the moment to use it to ambush someone for the kill. The only difference is that Darryl has 24% more health, his super charges on it's own(and takes less hits to charge), his star power nullifies 40% of damage, his attack close range actually does more damage than Leon. Darryl is literally a tankier version of Leon playstyle wise so why would Leon having his super charge at even 50% of the rate of Darryl be game breaking?
---
Kind of reminds me of the tf2 team... a sizable game with 16 people on their development team last I checked which is like 4-6 programmers
---
At tye very bottom near the entrance there is letter and If you take time to look at the letters it spells out Retropolis backwards
---
I really don't think any of you all know how game production works
---
She is queen of Brawl Ball
---
Neegan?
---
Or you are just shit
---
Hasn’t this been mentioned before? 
---
The fourth one is obviously for his super and is therefore non-functional most of the time
---
And he is like " hey bro i am spinning please show sympathy and walk into the gas "
---
Are you retarded? Supercell already said that in brawltalk
---
Did you just assumed its *EXISTINCE* /s
---
Look at the brawl talk bibi footage closely, it's clear that her movement speed increases when her knockback effect is charged
---
You're right, I forgot about BB. She's really good there.
---
Is she epic?
---
lol
---
Spike
---
69?
---
Supercell is trolling us
---
I don‘t know what you expected other than 60‘s themed maps
---
Your trash man
---
She is most likely to be epic
---
You cant blame a Youtuber for tips,Not everything will go your way if you have problems playing with randoms just play Solo Showdown
---
His super is an invisible bear
---
Actually it's barley's 4th and 5th skin
---
Thanks for the support!
---
This is some sherlock homes shit

But you kinda want that dub

---
I want updated versions of these, **NOW!**
---
Supercell made changes to the mushroom rings where it now spawns away from teamers and into those being teamed against. Same thing with meteors, but those now attack teamers.
---
Supercell: that why you call it a DREAM, cuz you have to be asleep to believe it
---
Dew to latest skins it'll be his skin
---
Exactly, how do they not realize we need some remodels and skins for the brawlers that don’t have any? Most people don’t even buy more than one skin for the brawler, mostly YouTubers or if the skin is really good. People would buy more skins if they were on different brawlers
---
I agree that it's not like she's kairostimes #1 choice for Brawl ball, but my argument is simply that that doesn't mean she's impossible to use, in fact that's not even close to being true
---
*THE F**K YOU SAY TO ME YOU LITTLE SH*T
---
Relax dude. This is actually a good skin, unlike the thick chin and ripped dress of Night Witch Mortis (that’s the only issues I have with NWM)
---
4th and 5th skin for barley
---

Solo mode. Or just a better gamemode, or even siege remodel

I was a bit sarcastic but whatever
---
This is stolen. Try to my your own art.
---
Poco, are you high? (XD) (Take my upvote!)
---
X points put exact middle
---
Why doesn't the safe? 
---
Supercell: yes
---
I can see spike on the 1st picture.
---
TARA DIDN'T GET REMODEL sir
---
Missed am opportunity to call him Legendaryll
---
Ngl that Brock skin is dope but what about the other brawlers that have 0-1?
---
*Which was obviously planned from the moment they were changed to have that health amount!* (This also applies to Dynamike)
---
Yes! That's what I need from you dude. I think that Sub = Legy is against SC rules &amp; that's why they Copystriked you just think I saw post from supercell saying Create videos for free, and you don't have any links or anything that helped you to make these things like poses but they Copystriked you is because of that Sub = Legy
---
Stop being so annoying. There are other reasons to not like him
---
Its better than stealthy assassin. These titles aren’t just chosen randomly. Poco and Pam has healer because they heal. All the assassins have their own title because they are all different. The people who have fighter are Shelly and Bo because they don’t fit into the other categories.
---
Piper didn't get remod sir
---
You downvote me, I downvote you . Simple
---
Zebo wy chuje
---
U didn't get remodel sir
---
I know, but they released Frank and Penny before Global and cut that 4 letters name line!
---
8)
---
Even luckier than me. I got gene and pam in the same box
---
That’s a new-old (new but not newest) update to stop teaming
---
(and nita)
---
According to google Riot has 2500, Epic Games has around 700 and Supercell has 213. So, who want to donate their time/experties/money to help SC?
---
Please f***off
---
What's with maple barley
---
My bad lul
---
Of course you should but then there are some people who will support him..
---
Anyways i cant change the title so
---
Yee
---
Batrick
---
Nwm isn't trash imo
---
Its animation makes up for it
---
Its super pattern is so cool
---
Its actually just mortis's actual face plus lipstick and different eye color
---
Mortis actually has a elongated chin
---
Bull on the left.
---
He already did lol

My older videos without it were also copystriked, but thanks for the help

Honestly... Extremely likely

BRAWLERS NEED REMODEL B4 SKINS DUDE
---
Big fan sire!
---
On youtube...
---
Do not add new brawlers! Rosa adding was close to kill the game, don't do it again.
---
Nah I'm not a stealer
---
*What about Mortis? He would dodge the arrows!*
---
**Or El Primo? He would jump on the King and** kill him!
---
***Or Shelly? Tap Tap Tap Booooom!***
---
Nice, cool
---
There is no midgame content
---
I mean barley is considered a male so..... I don’t know about this one chief.
---
The framerate man...
---
Its called an abortion...
---
I guess he's tired of people give him trash every two tweets
---
I never said there was
---
I mean, Night Witch Mortis looks terrible but the attack effects are cool, let's hope Bake Sale Barley has cool attacks and looks cool in game.
---
Bartley’s 4 and 5th skin actually. Default
---
It would be kinda cool if he sounded like an old hardened sea captain with a robotic effect on his voice.
---
Fuck up
---
But why do we need club mail in a game where clubs have absolutely no purpose? 😅
---
Seriously, the pace at which SC adds stuff to BS compared to CR is ridiculous
---
Stretching out videos to 10 minutes to get more ad revenue isn‘t great. I looked your channel up and I don‘t if you can call it content to use Supercell in-game assets to make videos about swapping character models around. It’s frustrating to lose such a big channel, but I‘m not sure if it‘s undeserved. Good luck though
---
Too much jojo references
---
The snapchat filter be like
---
It's "GOD TACTIC"!
---
I knew she was a new brawler. Can't believe people actually thought she was a Mortis/Leon/Tara skin.
---
I just want a Piper skin :(
---
You are very welcome
---
Same for me... I got Leon last week but I was so excited to play him that I forfot to screen shot it...  :(
---
#NEW BRAWLER OH MY GOD OH MY GOD NEW BRAWLER BRAWLER NEW BRAWLER COMING S00N
---
It's disappointing cuz she looks creepy
---
rip my dude
---
You said thes want to make sure there is any midgame content. So I assumed you hold the view that this update added some midgame content. Anyway what we have now is not a game. It gets very repetitve. Dont take me wrong I like this game and I play a lot but they are missing so much that by the time they add something we really want it will be too late and this game will die out as many games before which were stale.
---
What the fuck? You think this is the only skin people shit on? Just going to go on a limb and say your exaggerating to prove your point.
---
Batty
---
I can see an exploit here
---
Lucile?
---
F
---
BB
---
My opinion is that they made brawlstars to make some money. Once it dies they will move on and make another one
---
I just bought gems, I'm ready for Bibi 
---
About to hit my enemies to Clash Royal  with the force of 1000 Shelly supers
---

---
Next thing you know the missile detonates.
---
Pffft
---
Does this guy really want LoL's balance here?
---
Yeah I’m thinking there *has* to be something bigger in this update right? A new brawler and some maps isn’t exactly a ground breaking update. For the amount of teasing I was expecting either a new major mechanic like quests, a *truly* unique brawler or maybe even a clan gamemode like in COC with clan wars.
---
Yes - Rockabily, Top Hat, Night Witch and Classic
---
The supercell cycle :(
---
I have a feeling she’s going to heal people because of the + ear rings and heart button on her vest. Maybe it’s an instant heal like Pocos, but it’s in a radius like Pam’s?
---
uhh... F
---
#THAT'LL TEACH YA!
---
Didn't he even bother to actually get the real Gene picture? XD
---
What about... a poker Tara/ Leon or a mobster primo?
---
Yea the only game they keep on working is clash royale because it has big esport scene. But brawlstars has too little skill cap to become such a big esport game
---
Tara looks lit so shut up idiots
---
I want that skin too.I sure hope its 80 gems.So when it comes out it will be discounted.And i'll be able to buy it 😈
---
And i bet they get better updates than we do😂
---
Yes, have you ever heard what a clown fish can do.
---
Lol at least we did something, not only just complaining
---
What about just a radius that heals/gives faster movement speed/ gives faster reload/gives more damage whenever teammates are inside it. One of those things would be anough and is schouldn’t be a turret.
---
Oni-Chan!
---
Bringing back some old maps 👀 cavern churn?
---
тара (рашн вершн)
---
This is also what Coach Cory said
---
Somebody on the Brawl Stars team is definetly a One Punch Man fan
---
ryan: am i a joke to you?
---
I like how the format shows how it's 100% your opinion she's bad in siege. The scroll tells the truth and you are just denying it.
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
That’s why I said it’s an INSTANT HEAL like poco, but instead of in from of him, it’s in a circle radius similar to Pam’s turret
---
I know that, this is a freaking meme. These kind of comments are getting more annoying every single post ffs stop.
---
You've just lost your Weeb Card
---
My theory is that he made this app before Gene wasnt even released. No one knew what his icon would look so I made a fan made one. This drawing for every youtuber and other people turned it into a "clickbait overdrive" and I am not even surprised that this happened. It has already happened around 40 times already.
---
Only weebs does
---
Something that belongs on r/blursedimages
---
Are u riding
---
no those are leon and frank skins, are you blind?
---
Why am I not even surprised...
---
This is like the 40th time.
---
Your shots would get blocked on a lot of maps
---
That face and arms
---
You can do that with all the brawlers it’s because of the projectile speed and the direction you are towards, vice versa, because as she’s attacking you are also moving towards it, that’s why it get hit
---
Piper, Tara, Pam and Primo will all get remodeled/reworked so dont expect any skins for them until they that happens, but spike or bo or ANY other brawler who already has a voice/good model could use a skin! I also really want more voice acting since thats what makes the game feel so alive!
---
I only like the Carl one.That is accually worth something.The others are shit.
---
Man, this looks sweet! Guesses on what Bibi's super will be below!
---
Beware, using the words bought and gems in the same sentence can cause some people to show their F2P “dominance”
---
The ultimate powercube
---
She dashes towards the nearest target and delivers a big and powerful hit, sending them flying!
---
Make him seem more like a dad.
---
The bat needs a name as well
---
ONE PUUUUUUUUUUUUNCH
---
hmm
---
I like the Canadian power cube
---
He is one of the few counters against rosa
---
Next brawler prob is a pink-haired sword fighter
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
or pink haired weirdo who shoots people with a tommy gun
---
Jigsaw too!
---
Maybe the new brawler Bibi
---
Sakura spike: am I a joke to you

\*\*c r o p  t o p\*\*

Well played
---
Let me guess with balls the size of peas.
---
DETAILS PEOPLE! THIS IS WHAT MAKES BRAWL STARS GOOD
---
I think that they made skins for the most played brawlers. That means they can expect the biggest revenue from it.
---
kevinnn
---
Me: skins for Pam? Piper? Tara? Bo? 
---
Supercell: Brock! Barley! NITAAAA!!!!
---
Or don’t have any
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
Nothing
---
Same happens to me with Rosa already
---
Is that percentage based on buying the mega boxes?
---
Barley has 5 skins
---
Rosa flashbacks

Ah shit here we go again

I love it when other artists complement other artists, it makes me feel good inside

With what
---
Tara looks fine as is no sense in whining
---
I consider Night Witch a different character than default Mortis. Same for Rico and Richochet.
---
That might help you sleep at night. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I bought it at discount. Would prefer a mega box to get another legendary rather a skin for a legendary. The skin is good tho

Oof sorry

It’s on a different sub. It’s not technically stealing but can be seen as rude and annoying. Don’t go crapping on the guy just explain yourself to him.
---
Beautiful shit post!
---
Bull pulled a ProJared
---
Yeah but is weird to see a "girl” with a mustache
---
Yeah, like. Wow. A new environment is cool, but not exactly amazing as we expected.
---
a surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one
---
Oh shit you're right
---
There's always more than what was shown in the Brawl Talk. Usually not big things, but everytime we get a new update, there's more than what we saw on the Brawl Talk.
---
Not as bad as pointy chest bo
---
Doesn’t need a buff nearly as much as Shelly poco or piper still lol.
---
I kinda agree but the thing is that I saw NO POST like this and I think he just posted it on other community thinking that I will not see it
---
your clip: https://youtu.be/K5Y8Nh9QGMY
---
I thought playing for a pro team would make me a pro but ok, you clearly know more than I do
---
I see no problem with the current system, completely skill based.
---
Its obvious op doesn't know we need remodel b4 first skin 
---
Otherwise op wouldn't post this
---
We might be getting tara remodel in this update but i doubt it
---
Both
---
The chances of you playing at a time where no high trophy brawlers are there is so damn low. It happens sometimes though. Congrats on pushing Gene to 500.
---
It’s normal font for me
---
Those people who think that are noobs. He is 6th best brawler in the game right now...
---
Lucena or maybe if your a THW Lucille
---
But still, i could be a level 10 brawler and have 0 trophies, and the game would pick me for a game with noobs! That's not okay.
---
The base model is counted as a skin. It still had just as much work done as the others.
---
"Helped me take out teamers" You have become the one thing you swore to destroy
---
Pretty much means “ok”
---
Who is ze
---
Y’all omg stop being so transphobic ITS NOT THAT DEEP ITS JUST A SKIN
---
Of course there are, just like CR rip offs
---
And which pro team do you play for?
---
He has one gun holster but he has twin revolvers
---
r/mortisgang
---
That takes a considerable amount of effort, and is a rare instance.
---
This lucky play isn’t gonna make it to the top until the retropolis and trans biker shit hype goes down
---
Ok i thought tara will get new model in this uodate as a suprise maybe i was right
---
Pronoun for transgender
---
Rip pam noone is talking about her while she also doesnt have one, rip...
---
Not for me! I see atleast one maxed out dude in one of the games i play when i get a new brawler. One time a maxed out shelly died on purpose to surrender her win to someone else.
---
The worst thing is that I never use brock and I hate using him thats one of my worst brawlers and im at 7.1K.   trophies

I thought of that too When he sent it to me

Thats probably why :)

Tara and Leon are silent on purpose yall wake up

Does the enemy have a single brain cell, combined?

The hero we need.

Ok

Hmm I thk the main reason is super cell is working on the remodel of those brawlers ( piper Tara ) so they won’t release new skin until they finished the remodel
---
Looks authentic

Ain’t gonna lie... she pretty thicc

In this art style she looks way better

It’s hard to say when to start play 3v3 cuz 3v3 is always better to improve ur skill in bs, when U get up in trophies (say like 5k) go join decent club and play with them in 3v3 . Also, pass 400 in solo sd,  teaming is so toxic , so definitely not recommend to play after tht , choose either duo sd or play solo when there’s modifier (energy drink n robo ppl team less not for  healing mushroom and meteors tho)

Piper looks the best in this game
---
Night Witch Mortis is an amazing and really dumb skin, and so is this
---
5880 health (4200 lvl 1)

120 degree attack angle (exceeds Frank and Poco)
---

---
Seems like it's gonna just be another Rosa 2.0 =(
---
disgrace to 13 year olds
---
maybe that was a bit too harsh
---
It’s been addressed the last few times it’s been out
---
tHE MECH CHARACTER IS NAMED A. VA I'M WHEEZING
---
At the end of the day, one good synced push gets you the win in most scenarios
---
Autowalk? U mean when u walk to wall it goes to side? 
---
Your joystick probably is about 1° to that direction
---
You sure you're 13?
---
You seem 8. Go onto Facebook or something to complain
---
Who, probert or The game leader?
---
The Carl one at least half as good as Gedi-Kor’s skins, and the Maple Brock
---
I think this skin looks just ok, kinda disappointing considering the fan made ideas we've seen such as Viking Ship Carl, Detective Carl and Bathtub Carl
---
Rosa was nerfed individually, meaning other brawlers who could have been changed were ignored, additionally it’s still blatant that Rosa is at the top, so nothing in just said that as invalid.
---
Also I remember the video being made around the end of beta - early global, not sure which one exactly. But before you start crying, supercelll themselves explained why they are and choose to be a small team https://supercell.com/en/our-story/
---
Poor counter argument, ignores evidence, horrible reflection on yourself. Already debunked all your points, though you may feel free to try again.
---
Poor poco
---
I think that maybe it will be 150 if his pickaxe is replaced with the steering wheel as a special attack.
---
Yea I drew it in 1 hour😂 thanks for the support
---
Well all know this
---
550 Powerpoints.
---
He needs a buff
---
Luck is on point
---
Thanks
---
woah buddy calm down
---
i mean, yeah, but i see more mortis spampost than leon tbh
---
dont mean to sound mean but no one cares and posts like these although with good intentions are ruining this sub
---
S-Class hero meaning it could be a legendary? lol ik that's a reach but still...
---
Yup, exactly u aren’t at higher trophies where higher skill cap brawlers are also beast
---
Pam does no have voice
---
Ok makes sense. Who is higher skill cap?
---
😂😂😂😂
---
this is heavily underrated
---
What is VO
---
If it gets more updates we might just want to switch to that game
---
Cheers bro
---
I love the idea, 5v5 3v3 game modes but supercell is gonna have to work something out with the lobby to have 5 on the same team. Communication with this map will be key because a team could sneak up behind the enemy for a surprise, bolt spawns will have to be changed and
---
Lmao Love these videos😂😂 Thank you can you do crow?? And also why are they blurry ??
---
Tbh its a ripoff but the character design is on point
---
Forgot to respond to u btw when u said u were gonna make another Hope you get more upvotes!
---
There’s literally an entire post topic about this, it autowalks in whichever direction you walk in (some of the time, as it’s very wonky) linearly at a 90• angle. 
---
Unlike other games that allow you to glide along walls and give you a world of more movement options, this moves for you; left or right, and if you go against it, it slows you down and can cost you many battles where walls are involved.
---
It’s absolutely atrocious when fighting along say, cactuses or one-block walls as it constantly moves you, and not at all always in the direction you want to move. This is a broken mechanic which needs a fix, nothing wrong with the player’s movement.
---
To add on, considering what you said about “1*” degree, if that were the case logically you’d move in that 1* degree direction, but you don’t. It turns you 90• in that direction (and again, doesn’t always work).
---
Trying to make it a chain
---
Haha. So enlighten us on how it works.
---
Spike has a skin, and Carl just got one from this update.
---
As they are working on the previous brawlers I mentioned, they probably dont have time nor artists working on the new brawlers.  They don't have a team of unlimited people.
