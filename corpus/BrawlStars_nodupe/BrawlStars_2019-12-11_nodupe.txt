Maybe learn your grammar first mate

If you really leave, let someone get your account

It’s not ay yai though
---
Cursed image
---
It’s not rare at all, there were tens of millions of people playing last Christmas. Get over yourself.
---
This legitimately makes me sad: I created a new brawler with stats, and even like 20 voicelines. It gets 80 upvotes. Someone just took an image and adds a text bubble. Almost 4 times more upvotes. I need feedback so I can actually improve it. :/
---
You know this is a 10 year old song
---
You’re obviously a child so I won’t say anything further, except don’t act like a little prick on the internet.

that when you are afk for long time or when you went afk and you recconect much times

Ummm i dont remember brawl stars having....you know
---
That Rosa is for sure hacking
---
*UNLEADED
---
and no, its not new
---
Lol I was just thinking about this
---
She's from the desert trio :D maybe i'll do them next
---
This is the best fcking skin I’ve ever seen
---
And for some reason in 3ve the matchmaking (at least for me) is stuck on 2/6. And when a new brawler comes out, it's literally impossible to play any 3v3 gamemode because of this.
---
Know it has been in the game for a while. If you log out of the battle twice it will fully kick you out until the battle finishes
---
And do nothing
---
Looks neat! I like the “polygon-ish” style you’re going with this, but I have two critiques
---

---
1) It needs some stronger outlining. Give it some stronger, thicker outlines to give it a more *bold* look.
---
2) The colors look bland, and it looks too bright. Put some more contrast in the colors, give the colors a more richer color.
---
I feel you bud I'm same but only got sandy at 18000 all maxed just need coins
---
Isn’t that every brawl stars youtuber tho except for the underrated pro players and kairos?
---
1/6 layers found

xd but when you search "brawl stars official" you will find it bruh i think only me know that

Stop with ads

Yep, and not believing it, sometimes I think this community is toxic and bad
---
The fuck that is ram you idiot. Maybe at least get that right before posting
---
Yeah, Morti NEVER team in showdown. They are the true heroes that heroically flee from everything and everyone to get high placement. The true heroes :/
---
Imagine not having Mortis as S-tier.
---
That to me before
---
its in baby yoda's heac
---
I mean I do agree with this statement, but that doesn’t justify the thousands of kids getting all crazy in the comments.

Yeah hat or no hat mortis is mortis

"Eventually" you'll get all of the brawlers. That may be quite long though. There are so many people who don't have their first legendary, even though they have been playing since global release. In my opinion, buying legendaries is the only good use of the gems - because that's the bottleneck of the completion of your game.
---
Buying a legendary doesn't affect the drop rate from boxes. Whenever you get a legendary from a box, now you will have 2 legendaries instead of 1.
---
You could spend the 350 gems on token doublers or tickets - getting you say 120 regular boxes. That is one month of f2p progress - virtually nothing as far as progression is concerned. Get the damn legendary.
---
I love how everyone here complains about the people complaining, yet no one gives a shit about the Supercell bottlickers here.
---
Guys don't cry we still have star Shelly
---
I nammed the map "Mixed Shots" bc I tried to make it viable for the majority of brawlers, it's a versatile map that has space for mortis, piper, long range shooters in general, shelly, frank, bibi, etc
---
It is open but at the same time has some cover that can be used strategically
---
ye i have them both too
---
fuck its the cactus
---
Exactly, i swear they're more annoying than the people who complain. Like complaining is bad when you have a game as a service? It's free yeah for some, but others invested their hard earned money into this game. The least i expect is good matchmaking.
---
And now he's trying to tell someone to get out of this sub. Also happy cake day btw

Do urealize the Darryl rtrophies below?

Do you play mortis in brawl ball? With coiled snake is pretty fun and good. Just stay away of bulls/Shelly with high hp lol. A solid tier A

Weird flex but okay

They're half correct tho
---
Tbh, lots of friends can be trash at playing just like mine and yours and possibly others.
---
And always think positive and believe you can win every match!
---
Who is wonderbrad
---
You never know! I'm trying to push this idea as this was in the last Chill Staff project, the Halloween one, where this same, but halloween-ified, concept was in there!  
---
But even if supercell comes up with the same concept without knowing about this idea or they simply take inspiration/use this concept directly (we will never know basically) I can say I at least predicted it 😊
---
most people i run into that use super bouncy usually abuse it and end up sucking
---
Line skins aren't limited I don't think
---
21k
---
I know her super is insane..... But if they Nerf her super then she will completely become unplayable
---
I'm not sure. I'm not that good with numbers but for the sake of the prices shown in my picture, I'll probably say 10 for a win, 7-8 for a draw, and 5 for a loss.
---
fr
---
Haha yeah this could speed up progression, while still being a fun way to do it!
---
Thank you! And yeah I'll imagine they'll make it more grind-y, but that'll be part of the fun I suppose!
---
Amazing drawing but I think it’s for fame and for glory
---
I've got both too but... USE ROBO RETREAT YOU UNCULTURED SWINE
---
Prices are examples, as said in the title :)
---
As if being a gemmer is a bad thing lol. Shame on people for supporting the game they love!
---
Yep!
---
The fact that Dani is still havent posted any photo leaks before they record the Brawl talk makes me feel like brawl talk isn't going to be tomorrow...
---
Upload it to Youtube with sound, they love Sr Pelo and this reminisces of him a lot.
---
all we need are more villagers and we get solo showdown in a nutshell
---
Well, this could be beneficial as players will feel an incentive or reason to play, and they could be working for it. Plus, I think things will be more expensive as shown here.
---
Thank you!
---
yeah cause there is only two, tbh I don't like any of the Penny skins (even tho I have one for some reason)
---
Thanks!
---
“who’s this retarded?” maybe the guy who doesn’t remember when Brawl Stars said that these skins would never be available again when they initially launched them, but now they have changed their mind to the dismay of the people who bought them on that premise. In other words, you. You are the one who is “this retarded”!
---
Thanks man!
---
Where u get this from
---
Y'all not realizing brawl talk usually happens around the 21st
---
You have sandy ??
---
Keywords: max and power
---
Gene is the uncle because he has a mustache
---
Well, just a concept by me, but I hope one day it's added, I will be in too!
---
That could work too!
---
oamL
---
Yes it's a pam skin!
---
Yeah, I'm trying to push this idea further!
---
eyy i have both i like robo retreat more
---
It's not a bad thing I'm just responding to him saying people with money are flexing with limited time skins. When many Havnt paid a cent.
---
Back In the days? Didn’t she come out this year? Lol
---
Who still uses this lmao? No hate, I just thought people moved on...
---
Yeah maybe they could replace the token doublers with something else, like star points.
---
You dare insult carl mortal
---
Well, it'll be a lot of work! Supercell could have their own limit I suppose and they would likely make it more expensive.
---
Omg stfu with the hat Mortis crap.. some people like hat some don't,  it's not hard to understand
---
Yeah that can work!
---
And that's your opinion , which your entitled to.
---
You can play brawl stars in portrait mode 0-0 
---
I want that :(
---
One of the best supers to chain
---
xClash Of Clans

Lmao so true, would've been more appropriate with another brawler but I love the meme

Bruh it got put on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
---
You need to fix power play matchmaking for real. there is no way a 15k trophy rank gets matched with 3 to 6 k trophy players for back to back to back games  in power play while opponent are consecutive 12 to 14k avg players. Don't give me that crap about power play matching players with similar power play points but this kind of matchmaking is just garbage. I have been playing the game before it became global. just saying.
---
Even colt is an og and sucks but wtf do you mean og brawler even she is og she need a balance of the range and suoer
---
Wtf are you saying my dude she can spam sher super
---
Then just play solos
---
That reminds me I have to get gas tomorrow.

Dude she can spam supers and charges in 3shot +de super counts like 2 shot an she needs one shot to spam it Darryl when he rolls is vulnerable
---
Why would you like it more then a legendary i mean gems are more useful for new brawlers yeah but a legendary is much more rear then some 3 gems oof

For those who don't understand, in brawl talk, Bibi dealt 1,960 (1,400) damage from every swing. When she was actually released, she only dealt 1,820 (1,300) damage per swing. I mean, it was a good idea considering she was pretty good at release.

Jessie is my top brawler with 700 trophies
---
I knew that they were LiMiTeD but didn't had any gems to buy coz i also started the day it went global
---
Or 700 diamonds for legendary + skin *sale*
---
Yeah, he's blocking everyone who is defending me, like you (thanks :\]) because he thinks you guys are my alt accounts :/
---
Lol
---
If you don’t have any level 9 brawler then it’s worth it.
---
After you unlock 1 level 9 brawlers you can get star power from boxes. That’s a potential 2000 gold saved if you get one SP from box.
---
Should max out 1 brawler to 9 ASAP. If you already got one then the only offer worth your gems are token doubles and tickets
---
Game play is great too.
---
Can you use it on my youtube if you allow?

As a Jessie main I am kind of glad to see that, I was not yet playing during last christmas and her brawlydays skin is the only one I am missing. But to be fair, I do hope we get some new sick skin additions and perhaps for people who already had them last year the originals should also be sold at original price. Remember guys, exclusive skins is bound to upset players who cannot obtain them and it also deprives SC of extra income which could be made as they tend to be very popular and in high demand.

Welp you better try again

---
Habalabrabaaaa hi
---
F for unable to change title
---
I thought a Mortis would be more likely to do that. Anyways, just cooperate if they wish to camp, you might be triggered by their playstyle but its better to be angry and gain trophies, then to lose 18 trophies just because you hate their play style. I met those players before. I was a power 6 Mortis, and I camped in Deserted Vertex at the bottom right corner cuz we didn't get a single power cube, but my teammate Piper just kept shooting and revealing our location, and we got a 4th. Just camp with them, and hopefully get a 2nd or smth, at least don't throw the game. At least they aren't going suicidal.

Plot twist: Supercell is discontinuing Brawl Stars
---
plot twist: brawl stars dont exist
---
Assuming its ur 1st SP, fertilizer cuz of the curveball nerf, so you can join powerplay, otherwise, just focus on the next brawler to lvl 9 and you'll unlock SPs eventually
---
Mine is 3AM (Daylights saving) if it’s not then 4AM.

Did you research this at all? You can’t just claim something is fake without looking into it.
---
Why is this funny to me?
---
What’s a brawl stars?
---
Bug/Glitch. You can do it several times. Just play match and then turn off phone. And move your phone in "up" possition (sorry i dont know how to say it in English) then turn on phone and you can see it by one second or sth like this.
---
Once again, sorry for English :)
---
And i want to say: not every phone can fo it i think. I use Huawei p9 lite mini

Can the truth be literate and legible?

**YEP**
---
Yup
---
How did you get that?
---
i love hollow knight!
---
Do you remember when the brawl talk with Tick came out? Yeah, he was then added in the game the same day.
---
And then... people ask to me why I think Shelly needs nerf...
---
Happy cake day! :D

I wish if i had it ...

What’s your player tag
---
Forgot to record it
---
The true point is: I don't care about them. I care about me. And they keep interrupting me and making me lose trophies. I'm not saying you're totally wrong but we can only make progress if we win.

Bruh moment

I hate the game because I still dont have spike and so that means the entire game as a whole now sucks and we should all boycott it because I dont have spike

Why would you not want more content...?
---
Nice. You remind me of me when I was a big fan of Lukie, lel.
---
Yeah, that’s what I said
---
Waste of time.
---
The whole reason this video exists is to make people  stop crying about Brawl Talk and actually understand why we don't have it yet. Grow up
---
He can't use the Joestar secret tehnique
---
Good question, if I was to physically tell them 
---
Then I would say sarcastically.
---
Thx for asking though
---
Oh yes that will be better
---
Sureeeeeee
---
Nice job Dynamike
---
Tbh, i don't like when you can score using normal method but try to look cool (trick shot) and end up look like idiot :/
---
Spandy?
---
Sorry about this, but if you are older and know how to play Brawl Stars, see brawl tubers is a waste of time
---
Ark’s video didn’t even answer the question about when is brawl talk. So much for talking to their community. Lol
---
Very cool idea! I've always tried to make an interesting zone control idea but this seems better than my ideas :P
---
I know, but if this guy put a big clickbait saying "WHEN IS BRAWL TALK" it's ok?
---
If you care about skins at all that’s what you should spend them on. If you don’t want the star point skins just use all your points on boxes but it’s not worth it to buy boxes with star points imo
---
P2w
---
That WOULD be nice
---
I did.. not even god has so much power!

Thank you😊😉

imagine phoenix crow and white crow after remodel (tho they may change white crow's name like golden rico)
---
Crow, Tara, Shelly, Colt, Poco, Mortis, Jessie, Nita, Brock, Darryl. He actually only has 10.
---
And you try to play as well as possible to make these 1k people proud of you
---
I like bibi the most lol
---
That's a handball! Yellow card
---
Who is this guy
---
I don't follow any Brawl Stars youtuber, Frank talked about this video so i give it a chance....
---
totally regret -_-
---
LOL This one. Ok, Mr. Grown Up.
---
I once ate a burrito while getting killed by a mortis and I jumped so the burrito landed square in my lap and it was hot so I picked it up and ate it and then since no one was around, I leaned down and sucked the crotch of my cargo shorts to get the sauce out.
---
Yeah so?

Great job! Looks v fun

Spike nice art
---
it lookin like the scream painting
---
You read my comment on another post? You bastard
---
The point of the “clickbait” title was to, you guessed it, bait the kids into watching the video, so that Supercell can explain about the update, the Brawl Talk etc. That’s it
---
That’s what made you angry? The clickbaity thumbnail that literally everyone uses? I mean, how else are they supposed to make kids watch the video? Do they title it “why you should shut up about Brawl Talk”? I don’t think so. That would risk them losing their fanbase for “being too mean”.
---
Jesus, it’s like you’ve never seen an interview with a clickbait thumbnail before
---
ooh
---
Button to flip map vertically

This is gold 😂😂😂

don't be so lazy, just search thing up 😊 [Lwarb Stars](https://www.lwarb.com/)
---
Bruhh Bruhh.
---
Save up for it! It's honestly a pretty hype skin but I agree honestly the fire looks cooler imo, plus people love to target Gold skins lol. Plus hes getting a remodel which isn't gonna affect the Mecha skins but who knows the Phoenix crow skin might look even better :)

Nice story, but its only

I had 20 something today but this is impressive

I think Leon little bit OP

Kkkk new brawler power cube ;)

Yo how did you get this darryl tag
---
Kind of
---
But no
---
Lots of people said that to
---
Ya boofheads it’s a mirror and thats you!
---
It's tomorrow though
---
r/cursedbrawlstars
---
You got to put hashtag before saying it
---
Well it can’t be Leon cause I see him, so, Rosa!
---
You realize that Twitter is at least 13+ right?
---
SPIKEY boi
---
*FBI open up*
---
It’s Leon invisible according to a lot of people 
---
Then pickles in the jar 
---
Cute Joda
---
?????
---
#oh, thanks
---
@Brawlstars I didn’t get an answer so far. I have 3 main problem in the game please find a solution! 
---
1. Connection problems! 
---
2. Player who come to late or go afk do that I lost a lot of games because of this senseless player. When I start a game how can it be that I am afk the first 20 seconds??? Block them for a couple of hours or days or forever!
---
3. Game balance: I play on level 17k+ so why I have to waste my time with 6k player??? They have only one character on 600 or 700 and the others on 100. They are incredibly bad run in the middle alone and die, can’t aim or dodge etc. 
---
The game is so great but don’t use your time only for creating skins and fix the big problems of the game!

Also their play styles are different to u

*I think SUPERCELL isn't going to release brawl talk to hype players so we won't know what's coming*

Lol I thought it was tara cause of the cards ahhahahaha
---
Ya man
---
Thx
---
Good joke

Seriously guys, Did we really think Penny was gonna shoot coins at random?

as a darryl player myself,the darryl is true for me. i roll into an enemy and die instantly,with steel hoops

yes but it can be another thing
---
Very good bot
---
Are you sure about that? Because I am 99.99999% sure that C4n5t3r is not a bot.

The hidden video is about the landscape update from a year and a half ago. There is no news about brawl talk here at all.
---
Wrong. There is an unlisted video about landscaping I believe or something like that
---
supercell:we are guessing you have almost all brawlers a need 1 legendary &amp; all brawlers maxed,have some coins to help you with that final legendary
---
how many times do we have to tell this subreddit that there’s always been one vid missing. ryan confirmed it
---
This image is only more proof that Shiba Nita is the superior race
---
Black crow is the best.
---
I'd be happy with just brawl talk tbh
---
Exactly the same have happened to me (except it wasn't my bday)
---
You mean bots
---
Gems. Whatever currency mobile games name it nowadays. You get what I mean, why choose to be nitpicky about the name when I'm addressing a real problem.
---
wow
---
And how exactly do you plan on implementing this feature?
---
bruh
---
Maybe they’ve just scored a goal and are just bringing it back to mid.
---
Oh really, also happy cake day
---
You don't get it?
---
Are you overcommenting bcuz it's your cake day? 😂 I've seen you in over 30 posts now
---
Meme format?
---
maybe they grouped up together
---
#testing
---
Idea change crow to jump and die
---
Agree with point 1 and 4. Unfortunately Supercell kinda caters to those who are willing to pay since they are a company after all
---
Bruh, thought it was Michael myers
---
Just look at win rates he is only really good on lonestar. He is dogshit in other modes
---
Idk how to use it :'(
---
Spike...(I'm so good)
---
A picture with no edits with just a caption, tell me if that's effort
---
Yeah, I think those were my biggest problems
---
Rosa is red primo is blue I hate that dude and you do too
---
Give this man gadek a clown makeover
---
It's a star power... you get it from a box if your brawler is power 9.
---
YOU GET WHAT YOU FUCKING DESERVE
---
I dont trust a guy named Brock_OP 😂.
---
I think invisiheal needs nerfed but leon needs a buff either super duration or health.
---
ok sir may i ask y ur IQ is lower than room temperature
---
No. Brawlers should be rare.
---
Yeah, I get that, I just say for the people who play Brawl Stars and don't call their account complete unless they have every single skin, and try to go through such a process just so they can call their account "100% Complete"
---
True. The biggest clown are the ones who use their super on you just to get 1 or 2 cubes
---
That’s why I said not to much, but I see your point
---
It would be good, to tell you to stop attacking brawlers &amp; focus more on the robot, &amp; thus quicker matches?
---
Unreal Tactical Shotgun = Shelly
---
Hill with smile
---
I mean, he does look kinda like jotaro
---
 I’m saying it like that because rn it’s like 0.34% I’m saying like 5% is what you get for a brawler
---
Nobody actually knows.
---
Officially, we know that there is *something* planned for the anniversary. As to what that is, it’s all speculation.
---
Personally, I’m in the group thinking it’s going to be an update, or perhaps the day of the Brawl Talk telling us what to look forward to. It absolutely could be as simple as a free mega box, though, or potentially it could be something else entirely.
---
Rosa is red primo is blue I hate mihia and so do you
---
I   H O P E.
---
I never said sleep. Neither did the meme
---
For what type because that is way to high
---
Who cares
---
5% rare, 3% super rare, 1.5% epic, legendary can stay the same
---
Happy cake day!
---
This is traced from the official models/art, because the poses are the exact same, and it definitely looks traced imo
---
Uhh... is your screen ok there? Ya might wanna report this bug to devs..
---
bruh...
---
Me too didn’t see something
---
Bull you made my day!
---
It’s a top down view so part of the wall isn’t in the way.

That was on purpose
