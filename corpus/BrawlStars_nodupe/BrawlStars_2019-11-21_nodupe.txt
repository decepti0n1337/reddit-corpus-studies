Great, I am Hungarian :) Suprecell should expand it, end game is crap, I think :S
---
I love want rocket no.4 or ambush. Still haven't gotten them. Neither does snappy and incendiary
---
Issue is now Leon is played like a tank because his super is useless for how it‚Äôs supposed to be used (assassin), so a star power that doesn‚Äôt fit him at all is his best one
---
Society isn't ready for that level of commitment yet
---
What if it won't cancel the super? Then you could pull Frank over to hit them unexpectedly
---
"¬°Soy el mejor!"
---
I just absolutely love it when my teammates grab gems on their way to kill the gem carrier, especially when they just die and give them the ones they brought.
---

---
Really makes me happy when they repeatedly do that and hand over 10 gems that we could have made a come back with.
---
I like crow
---
He‚Äôs basically crow but also useful in lone star, and worse in solo showdown
---
Also, according to his backstory he was hit by a meteor and didn't die.
---
Heist but a brawler instead of a safe?
---
Ryan, take or leave it
---
still
---
They did a great job with Sandy though. Voice and lines are spot on for a young sleepy sandman.
---
Maybe... but, if they expand it the people will play more
---
(:0)-/-&lt;
---
so original and funny...
---
It's not night mode, Supercell just has a sets of different shadow patterns (maybe they're supposed to be clouds?) so the gameplay feels more "natural". you might've gotten lucky and got a large shadow pattern. :P
---
yeah but the sthing can still apply to a lot of other characters so
---

Nice ass, :D

I think gem grab is the most competitive.

Take my upvote. I love this.

Is it real?

Merica moment

If you zoom out far enough you see me and my teammates at 18k sending invites to even bigger gods
---
Yes sure I‚Äôm totally happy with that

Lmao We need to add a report button.

WHY IS HER A S S BIGGER THAN PAMS?
---
But isn't it still a 2v2? And were you jessie?
---
I get you man.
---
[removed]
---
Nice
---
Leon does not need a nerf to his damage, he is supposed to deal alot of it.
---
.145 is still quite low bud
---
Yea it‚Äôs called a thing that they didn‚Äôt talk about. Probably already in the update. Maybe secret brawler you can‚Äôt see.

¬øHablas espa√±ol?

no, you‚Äôre cake

I think that it should heal for 1000, but then heal less if it hit other targets.
---
This is my constructive criticism his lollipop goes a little to fast when thrown and way to fast while falling down into his mouth.
---
Lmfao
---
I‚Äôve been playing since before global using a different Apple ID, just keep opening boxes your time will come. I was one of those people at 2500 trophies when I got spike but in my defense up until that point I had been playing for two months without anything higher than a rare. (Before early boxes were predetermined)

BIBI IS A GIRL

What‚Äôs the prob? It happens a lot tho, sometimes u hv a bad team mate and then in the next match he is on the fkng other team, what a glorious moment in the game when u blast his face tho üò§

That 1K is rank 30 shelly trying to get to Rank 35 at lvl1
---
Mine was about .2164 when I got crow. About 3 months after my last new brawler
---
wut
---
Jessie might be the worst brawler but at least she doesn‚Äôt read a 10 page essay like Carl
---
Invisaheal op confirmed
---
/s
---
Man ur attitude towards this is just sad tho, the man has the right to complain about this. And if everybody does what you just suggested nothing would be changed. So why don‚Äôt you create a club and invite all those shiitty dudes and go fkng lose trophies together anh? Sounds good? Obviously not, this is a problem in the game, the game is getting toxic, not only teaming g in SD but also this...come on man?! I would like to thank Supercell for doing the hic in heist untouchable for the respective teams üôå
---
We need to make some noise or nothing will change dude ü§ô

Did you just give a gender to a robot? I thought they were always referred as ‚Äúit‚Äù.

Happy cake day

Omg this is so cute and I think making these sketches did give him more personality , anyways hope to see more of your art soon!
---
No pls we need a comic comforting jessie now gotta balance it out
---
Jessie white knights: * seizures and rabies intensifies*
---
nope
---
They probably subsist on Power Cubes.
---
And whatever's in Barley's bottles
---
This is so adorable omg lol I love doge meme template ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Upon further fact checking his arms are robotic so I have to agree, tho I thought he was like a gnome or something at first
---
Ummm....!
---
This is SO great!! Very well-played! I feel bad for Jessie. SO good below 700 trophies, but terrible once people learn to avoid clumping.
---
He‚Äôs got a lot of anger issues lol
---
Make it more hp... there are star powers that heal 800 and 1000 ho
---
penny and jessie main attack is effective cause people clump up at low trophies. high trophy ones stay in their lanes . jessie turret gets taken out by ranged brawlers(8bit piper brock etc) and throwers(tick barley). sandy  invis super is  what hurt most .scrappy can't shoot if he can't see. penny turret is still good because it's harder to take out and balls of fire is like having an extra barely in your team.
---
we need a male bibi skin
---
kairos
---
Oh, I like Kairos, personally. I think he's incredibly informed in general. I liked the one where he polled top players and even mentioned during the video how he'd rate things differently, but didn't include his own opinions. That's the better way to set up a tier list. This specific one was about star powers, but polling high-ranking players with a lot of game knowledge is a much better way than having it be some guys opinion, even if it's heavily backed with data.

those are some wierd people, purewater' wierd ass name lol. and let us not forget bot 3, also I cant believe you played with thee mr.beast
---
Morty the legendary did the same but its funny beacause he opened gene and nothing else happened
---
What has to stop? I only see a normal box that garenthees spike and Leon....
---
Gran teammate? What if gene teammate is a troll
---
You were hit by his super and took damage, but weren't stunned. 
---
~~ok im now gonna go try it~~

Its me

Can‚Äôt remember my highest, but played since June 2018 (6 months before global) and waited for 9 months for my first Legendary, and a second the following day...
---
Piper can fart too
---
mortis was an old man with suprising speed
---
I wonder why they don‚Äôt have money? Maybe it‚Äôs being taxed so it can be given back to them. Inefficient bureaucratic wealth distribution.
---
What are the odds of that?

And there is people that still think it...

Nah I just decided to post it later
---
That was some crazy luck dude
---
My highest was 0.1780%  
---
Im a player since global. I got my first leggy which is crow after 9 months of playing every single day.  I was at 10k trophies that time then I bought a discounted Leon after a week. I got Spike after a few days after I bought Leon. Then Sandy just this recently.
---
Also nita's backpack is broken too
---
Dude where's your name
---
I didn't got the red symbol but it lagged yesterday one time as if my phone was bad. Performance problems. My phone isn't bad and it runs normal again.
---
She a fatass bitch
---
Wise words, espacially that we have all the trophy road brawlers while the 1000 trophy people are wanting the trophy road brawlers. Cheers 8-bit

Well this looks shitty

Happy cake day!

Not crow, mortis is faster

You're giving them your money

Crow is half man half animal
---

Would you prefer a Tennis skin instead of a Baseball skin?

But how do you have no name? I‚Äôve seen other accounts too. But ai don‚Äôt know how they do it

Of course you can!

I made it myself
---
hap kaak deaY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Thanks!
---
Of course you can! I would love to be featured in your video
---
It's true. After listening his voice  I understand he is a man.
---
They all look like some kind of scam or something sketchy though. Some of them do have some english words in between.
---
I was actually lying to see how he will react. F2P but 14,3k. Got both Leon and Spike around 13k
---
Probably p2w
---
&gt;Only for those who group up together and in Big Game only. In high level no one does that and they will take out the turret very fast, and with organized team comp they always have solution against turret users
---
21 year old here, id prefer a balance that actually balances shit.
---
At least we get something for November while giving them enough time to actually give us something good in December
---
Why
---
one vs one with NORMAL health is more better than a BOSS health. NORMAL health mode is more quicker

---
Oh it will come, i just don't expect it to be a good one. Look at leon, his super got nerfed bcs his sp was overused instead of the other one? 
---
You have to be extra stupid to make a change like this.
---
Nah the figures arent canon nor official
---
Ew ur disgusting
---
There goes my fragile heterosexuality again
---
I tried translating it but it didn't really work
---
The super getting nerfed is a lose for both star power, I don‚Äôt get what you mean. Also, you don‚Äôt know the win rates of stuff, maybe it was too dominant (especially in lone star).
---
–∫—Ä—ã—Å–∞
---
You wann tell me you have 30 fps on brawlstars
---
Honestly though
---
The nerf affected more people without his star power, it's just a dumb change, and supercell doesn't put in effort as much as you think or i'd like them too.
---
Piper became your guardian angel
---
Because Nita also a bear
---
No teaming. But it was dominated by ticks, pipers, and crows. Healing starpowers were incredibly OP and healed the brawlers more than/almost the same amount that they lost health
---
Thanks, now I know why they say the free box is good
---
Supercell are a company and a business. If they can't deliver, people have all the rights in the world to complain. **Companies are not your friends. **
---
Personally I don't mind no update for a month, they have been keeping a really nice stream of content for a while now, and this window will provide some much needed breathing room for the F2P crows. However, I'm mildly irritated the reason for this is that "esports" cringe.
---
Must've been the hat

Yea thats why i said fits better as physical appearance

Alright, I tried

I dint change the neck

That's how you're grateful to the Piper who saved your life?

I'm confused, haven't played this set today... Any advice?

Same thing, I Alr have all the star tokens but after the update. It pop ups again
---
Bro he's just vibing
---
Yes, we're on it! Sorry for the bug =\\ Currently investigating a solution
---
He didn't say esports isn't real. He probably doesn't take Brawl Stars seriously as an esports game, which is fair. The game isn't exactly balanced. A competition certainly shouldn't cut into development time.
---
Thank You,I Upvoted
---
He looks worse now. The transition to the dance looks so unpolished, and his arms are way too disproportionate
---
if map has good bush spaces to hide then plant life otherwise thorny gloves.

U are not the only one bud

Oh, So you guys just came to add more skins. Great...

It's a great idea to support companies you love, esp those pursuing noble goals like Arbor, but always keep in mind companies are inanimate machines made to maximize profits.  Give them too much leeway and they *will* screw you over to save an extra penny. Remember what happened to Blizzard?..

if I still find out any information about the next update, I will definitely make a post about it

Nice!

Yo I like it, but it needs to be polished more

just go search or save and cop mines

You shouldn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs dumb because he was panicking, people do mistakes when they‚Äôre panicking.

Thank god I did em a good while before the update.

Bruh so anti social

That transition cut is really noticeable, And brawlers that constantly move like dynamike are super annoying to me.
---
Leonxjessieisreal
---
I thought the color was based on flowerpots lol
---
Maybe its to balance his nerfs. Like, for one nerf you get a new skin.
---
My friend didn‚Äôt have it... I swear if I can‚Äôt play power play today lol
---
Dynamike has the unique feature of having his attacks colored differently depending on if he is a friendly or an enemy. Friendly dynamikes have blue bombs and enemy dynamikes have red bombs.
---
I just wish more people looked through "Art" because when i found starry i followed and i check the profile every day for new content
---
This post is a joke, right?
---
This costs 150 gems yet it has more special effects than Phoenix Crow
---
His voice is kinda weird.
---
Magical vodka that disappears immediately after 2-4 seconds (depends if he uses main attack or super)
---
There is no El Rudo varient. Just the skin

Mad? You seem to be forgetting my complaint was about wasted development time. That has nothing to do with how good you, I, or anyone else is at this game lol. You certainly feel some type of way about my comment though.

[supercell has no plans to do anything about teaming.](https://imgur.com/bY5AOzJ)
---
teaming has been a strategy since the start of beta. even in 1000+ trophies everyone teams until there's an opportunity to back stab. u just gotta adapt and learn to play around it

No but we do sell lemonade.

Its cold, fresh, and its all homemade

We've a Unfortunate update. Although SC is aware of this issue. They said this will be addressed later tommorow, but that also means our lost power play matches won't be restored:( we've to bear the bad luck this time.

I keep forget about the new animation

That's amazing lol

Do you think you might do more commissions? You're great at the art and I for one would love a mini Brawler :)
---
Wow great observation.  Definitely hasn‚Äôt been made before, not even once.

I don't understand why they would need to make that blank before they added the box
---
Best comment-
---
Peace was never an option
---
I'm doesn't said
---
A new post about the space next to the box? Yes. Idk why but yes.
---
Maybe. Possibly some Christmas boxes.
---
Yeah you‚Äôre the 35th person to realize and post about it.
---
Oh yeah
---
Mate.. this is the first time im hearing of it and im no all-knowing man so its ok.
---
The iPad 2018 Pro had 120Hz support since launch ... üòâ

Best map I've seen on here
---
Its my first legendary so i guess it was the highest chance possible on a mega box
---
He
---
Oh ok, i get it
---
Didn't perform well enough to reach consistent 90 or 120 fps. Still locked at 60.
---
But also i had the worst chance to get an epic because bibi was the last one i needed

You can‚Äôt use an app to do this

You can post them here and set the Flair as Replay

Depends on OnePlus. üòâ

No for real tho, what is that animation. I‚Äôve never seen it.

These will be cool as skins

but seriously he is winning by  2000 votes

same

Stolen

It‚Äôs stolen anyway
---
I agree! Calm Gene was waaay better!!
---
You know it is in the update notes, right?
---
Are the skins going to be limited?
---
Same here and I am especially annoyed because my dad play my power play yesterday and lost every single  game!
---
The idea is bad
---
The old Gene was waaaaay better!!
---
Whta is this new one??
---
Let's see what we placed
---
That is true
---
is just because this i hated this update
---
*position showes up
---
Yeah I doubt they‚Äôll be a new rarity
---
UwU
---
Mega box perhaps?
---
Can confirm

Yep üëç

Me too
---
sold!

Oof

Removed. Rule 3. No providing information on how to break Supercell Terms of Service.
---
Poor Spike
---
Shocky is useless in competitive games, hyper bear is only good sometimes in heist. Coiled Snake Is essential, and da capo of poco is really Op at the moment ( It will probably get a nerf )
---
There will be bots i named my character bot64 for a reason. A reason i cant remember but still
---
I highly doubt they‚Äôll release a classic Rico skin. If they do, it‚Äôll be a reskin/remodel of the current model, it won‚Äôt use the old model
---
Watch clash of clans YouTube 
---
Everyone is doing different stuff like 
---
-th9 farm to Max
---
-th7 push to legend 
---
-th12 gem that rush 
---
-no cash clash

And many more
---
It should say spinning not teaming
---
Bad bot
---
Hi dad!
---
Frank confirmed himself that spike is never getting a voice
---
Dont forget her first star power aswell. You're stunned for a short period AND you have almost no movement speed, making it even easier for shelly to shorten her distance to you and charge her super again.
---
:/ I have all brawlers at level 10 with only 5 star powers missing and this just means I will get even father ahead (already have over 200 boxes saved)
---
Im pretty sure they want to add skins for Pam after her remodel.
---
I personally think 2 brawlers in one update would still be a lot, if not too much. While it's fun for folks who already have most of the brawlers, for the greater majority of the player base, it's just another brawler they're gonna have to wait a long time to get, depending on the rarity. Because the only likely ones at this rate they can obtain off the bat are Rare brawlers. And given the track record of the release of brawlers, it seems a lot more likely we'll get a Mythic and a high-end Trophy Road brawler sooner or later.
---
I disagree. This is a cringe sub full of illiterate and idiotic 8 year olds and it‚Äôs annoying me.
---
You *ducking* broke the chain.
---
Is not limited time

i know right üò≠

i didn‚Äôt have the energy to type out the rest, i‚Äôm sorry

 Poor gene

Maybe you don‚Äôt put the link then? Sorry but you broke the chain by typing that.
---
Woah woah woah...
---
It‚Äôs an ad :/
---
gene copied dynamike
---
Teaming bitch!
---
Rip Shelly + gene losing animation combo. Good while it lasted.
---
its the same for boom box brock. But they got it for dynamike and nita and pam.
---
I checked out the files. there's a "brawliday box" it is probably gonna be that
---
Poor gene
---
Still no fix to the widely reported bug where characters get stuck in place and can't move...
---
üÖ±Ô∏èruh moment
---
i got my first mythic at 13k, but i was unlucky with that
---
What about first legendary?
---
checked out the files, said brawliday box in one
---
Why don't you dyna-jump off this thread before I beat yo ass!

No supercell should give you gems after buying that
---
Do you guys like sucking different corporation dicks? The purpose of Supercell is to make as much money as possible and the customers want as many free things as possible. Free market 101.
---
If you can play above 800 trophies with a Brawler, you can say that you‚Äôre good. No matter how many trophies you have.  15k can also be 500 with every Brawler and that isn‚Äôt hard anymore.
