Oh no...

I am so touched by this book. This is a masterpiece!
---
What rank is your dynamike? It‚Äôs takes no skill so you should have no problem getting trophies for him if you want to prove your point
---
Agreed. Matchmaking is based on trophies not power. At least it's not cod mobile where matchmaking is based on how much you play.
---
MMMMHMMM he "HAD" 8bit

I would penetrate him. I think he would enjoy it.

Not really. But she have the most fan art I guess

Nice idea thanks

I like Nita decent range fast reload a good all around brawler

Why do you keep saying you don‚Äôt need a barely when we are talking about dynamike? I just think that if you‚Äôre gonna call a character op you should at least be able to play it first

Sorry üòÇi meant dyna. And what if i dont want to use dynamike? If i did, would i not be a hypocrite and go again what ive said about him?

Oh, I didn't know, thank you for doing your research instead of being like me trusting a bot that isn't 100% correct all the time. (I didn't expect it to be a idea steal instead of a image steal)

Then all the bots would be at lvl 1 and it wouldn‚Äôt be as fun

I too have scored a goal with 8bit by walking it in. There is no trickshot or amount of BM that will ever make you feel better while phones are thrown in rage.

Well, NOBODY made this meme when lone star came out until a month ago. And I had never seen this meme from 1 month ago until now. Nobody made this at all except for the guy 1 month ago and now. In fact I think only 2 od this type of meme has been made. So it doesnt appear as often as "omg guys shelly with super rekt 100 powercube bull lol" so I think this guy saw the post 1 month ago.
---
I've definetly seen ot before
---
I saw big bird XD
---
Does that mean anybody who dosent play brawl stars is born cool
---
Looks great
---
maybe check power points, tickets or gems?
---
If the bot checks and says this is a repost, it would probably be the memes with thr spongebob template but literally not in a r/brawlstars sub like maybe in r/dankmemes
---
Why do u blur out the names?
---
It's okay you didn't sound rude there.
---
I do remember my gem count but it didn‚Äôt go up. Can‚Äôt remember the others :/
---
I genuinely haven‚Äôt seen that post and I thought of this myself. I just had the same idea as someone else. Sorry to have offended you.
---
He dead
---
well, I don't know any other way to know, sorry
---
With the internet you never know
---
lol you never go barley in takedown
---
I want to bang you
---
I tried the gem grab tourneys. By the time I had 50 wins, the #1 had crossed 300. You have to stop sleeping for this stuff,  and even that may not be enough. If every match takes 3 minutes, you can play 480 matches in 24 hours. Getting those 300 wins is superhuman level of performance.

Nice!

It said there wasn't a repost, from what I know, the bot checks all of Reddit to find a post with the exact same thing so it would include the text too. If it finds a post it also tells how similar it is because the person might have changed it a little so less people would find it. So, it was wrong this time because the poster used another meme template
---
When Jessie hits the bot it bounces to other players and she can‚Äôt control who her super attacks
---
Well I thought like you but one guy said it doesnt care about the texts just the pictures

The fact that these YouTubers makes 100s of $ in a single vid from clips of other people hurts my soul and on top they have the odosity to put like and sub for free legendary on top like how greedy can a man get.They give nothing away to the community too at this fact my respect for JK brawlstars increases because he may be another montage maker but he givesaway almost every video a small portion back to the community and makes good edits with almost none clickbait.

excuse me what

I can imagine his common attack being him sweeping the weapon from left to right or right to left in a Bibi‚Äôs range, and his super being him jumping with his weapon and hit the ground hard dealing damage in 360 degrees, maybe in Bibi‚Äôs radius too. That would be cool
---
I laughed really hard when I see this lol
---
Users' choice award.
---
Ur salty cause ur bad. To keep this in reasonable terms, each brawler suits different maps; this is not like clash Royale where there is one deck, one team. You can play as any character on any map and each game is played against randoms with similar trophies so it‚Äôs completely fair. I understand some characters are sometimes broken but u can‚Äôt just say all characters are. I believe Jessie‚Äôs bot is broken rn and that‚Äôs it. However, she is not good in takedown for example. In addition, frank for example is amazing in some brawl maps but in other maps or game mode the maps are so open he gets clapped. Also who said u can‚Äôt play when these characters play the best on a map, it‚Äôs not like there is any restrictions.
---
Donate now every 60 seconds a minute of piper shooting at ELLL primo in showdown passes
---
What kind of ritual is this?
---
why?Are you Chinese?
---
Sometimes I do admit that I‚Äôm the bad random, but there‚Äôs other times where I just feel like my teammates are trying to be bad at the game.
---
And then there‚Äôs the BBall game throwers.
---
Frank is broken as batshit in Brawl Ball and Bull in Heist, which I stated before. Throwers have ruined the game especially in Graveyard shift

Where do you find this option

Firsts boxes are predetermined about what you receive, so, yeah, I know it's a pain in the butt when you just got some cents, and low p.points. Also, it's not a surprise the boxes dimish in reward when we have unlocked almost everything. No worries, sometime, they will release another brawler that will need to be received in a box :p
---
Maybe even 2 at same update, why not?
---
Definitely wasn't easy we stand a while doing it mainly on bounty which was tough because he gets 1 shooted by piper's

ok that you for clearing that up
---
Oh okay
---
Vote here
---
My friend just got him to power 10 big rip
---
The most enraging fact is: I have Darryl at power 9, but I don't have SPs for him
---
You're right
---
I don't know, I just login and immediately pressed **friendly battle mode** while I was in Robo Rumble Event, then it jumped into a **friendly match with Robo Rumble**
---
Oh hi mortis
---
If someone says 69 u have to say ‚Äúnice‚Äù
---
But I AM r/emojipolice member!
---
It's very good, but where's Darryl?
---
My start is: Pick Darryl with rolling reload. Grab all possible powercubes until the boss is at 50%. It's important not to die at this point. When you meet the boss, it's likely to have a shield. Use this to aim your super as soon the shield disappears and just go nuts until your health is running low. Take cover and do it again.
---
I had an average of 15 powercubes, which deals 5k per shot, 10k per ammo. You probably get 1-4.
---
Let me know if it works out for you.
---
And then you‚Äôll get permanently banned! Yay!
---
there is one; safe zone.
---
That map is usually full of ranged brawlers. Mortis' function there is to kill them and let it's teammates destroy the safe.
---
They start it again ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
"I need healing"
---
that's right
---
CROW
---
Hmmm, difficult, the creators will always be on a tight spot regarding these matters, cause no matter what they do it will always be a troll, and believe me I‚Äôm on your side on this, but the most that they can do and I think they should do is a report button, not to ban players but to avoid getting on the same team has them in the matchmaking.
---
Some colts, all jessies, pipers, brocks, dynamike and crow still treat Takedown as Solo Showdown with Angry Robo modifier (Jessie and piper especially).
---
When I'm playing with my 919 trophy bull this is what I've experienced. People who know how to play Takedown are usually the bulls, pams, and _some_ of the colts. These brawlers know what they're doing.
---
sorry, idk ;d
---
Absolutely. In regular ranked games well, shit can happen, at least if you put some time in you can always recover. But in Power play you can't, if your team mates decide to troll you're done and don't get another chance. In competitive modes, seeing how immature most of the player base is, a report feature at the very least is a must.
---
I actually played against a Morris today,he was actually playing it like takedown,not killing others.
---
I'm a Mortis main, but does not have maxed out Mortis. However, I have a rank 3 maxed out Rico.
---
She must be added! But not as a legy but as a rare brawler, I don't even know really wich rarity she can be, she's similar to every brawler from each rarity brock, emz, Rosa, Carl, Penny, bibi, tara a bit and crow. Overall, good job üëçüëçüëçüëèüëèüëè

Everyone on Takedown is attacking you not the boss

You mean Showdown 2?

Good, she's been broken for the past 3 updates. A character that can do 1.4k-1.6k at midrange and auto-aim each of those shots deserve to not be able to open boxes pre-level 8. 2nd most braindead character in the game. She gets nerfed for a reason.

It‚Äôs called the law of Murphy.

Shut up and take my upvote.
---
Nice work.
---
Other way around
---
I didn‚Äôt run into a single bot-ignorer. I started the day‚Äôs power plays with 845 trophies, what about you? I‚Äôm curious whether it‚Äôs a trophy range thing or just an I-got-lucky thing.
---
Anyway, the way my matches went was every single player focused the bot, people were spinning to agree not to attack eachother, and the brawlers involved were the usual spread for the mode.
---
Yeah but you if you lagging in these 3 time then arent you gonna be mad and even taht you want to get on the top 200 so you can get star points instead of nothing
---
Hmmm yes this is look s famyliar , some cartoon whit withcs and horses i tink
---
Spike is like FNAF screamer
---
AAAAAAA I was at 5000 when I got him
---
Of course it is!
---
You have the coins to upgrade her as well so her SPs are gonna be in the pool so yeah go for it.

this art style looks like Glitchtale's? Is this a redraw? Very good though üëå

Soo what is your prob maybe someone can or me could help you

I dont understood it too

more like piper with ambush is broken not piper without star power
---
Well at least attack others instead of just one only to have walk half the map to get to the robot cuz they died
---
Try that at 950 trophies, you'll regret it, it's probably a 8th 9th or 10th place because when collecting cubes you're losing out on a LOT of damage to the bot.

Flair checks out, it might work at lower trophies though.

Finally after 3 hours star token

The sides have to be round tho so that he can roll but other than that good job bro

But shit dude he is asking how much did you lost
---
 seige
---
I dont know
---
Dont you know that others just want to attack the boss? People like you should only kill players that are annoying you and not inocent people that just want to damage the boss. But no. That's why it's the worst mode. Playing by farming cubes on plauers will make them tired of playing the game and uninstall it. Think about that before killing others that just want to play innocently
---
And it's an epic as well

Well, Carl doesn't have time to participate in tier lists because he is too busy with rocks.

My entire club spamed that it was really annoying

The shield one is still better. At the World Championship you‚Äòre going to see many shield bibis, but no speed bibis.

That's me in take down

I remember that time I got a Bibi with the shield star power in boss fight at Insane II. We cleared it super easily because of how tanky she was. She would tank as a distraction, and I would constantly stack Shelly supers on the boss while our 8-bit killed off the smaller melee bots and gun bots. Think we managed to clear it way before the boss became furious.

When crow was weak(March) almost everyone said that he need a buff sooo if we said that Leon didn‚Äô t deserve that nerf‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî&gt; Supercell buff him. It‚Äôs simpleüòÉ

Wdym this is good 
---
And it's better than most of the shit on the sub
---
Solo sometimes is crap Because Everyone Is focusing on you or Everyone Is teaming
---
But sometimes its good
---
Takedown is crap cause every1 is attacking you
---
Not the boss
---
Lonestar is based on your luck
---
If you're not Lucky you will never get a kill
---
If I want to see art/drawings i'll join the art subreddit. This is a videogame, not an art class.

Nice!! and are you using FLIP A CLIP

This language is called ‚ÄùPro‚Äù

In hindsight, I think that there would have to be another unique skill added for each brawler. The content might not be dynamic enough. Would be cool to add a support skill for each brawler!
---
I know I said that :)
---
We already know this fam.
---
Brawlers with rl eyebrows are scary but this one is good
---
Lonestar is not luck  and takedown isn‚Äôt non competitive for that reason. i can consistently go on 6+ win streaks in lone star, and the meta definitely takes a certain degree of skill
---
Hey, I really like it

maybe add a bo in the mountains meditating
---
That would be me, among others, I'm afraid, reason being I want to charge my super.
---
As I can't hurt the boss, I tend to focus on other players to slow their progress while waiting for the shield to fade away.
---
Hey, it's a competitive game, what are you expecting?
---
Hello! Could I please use your clip in my Brawl Stars Highlights series? :) You would be properly credited in the video and in the description of the video. I won‚Äôt use the footage without your permission. If you‚Äôre interested, here‚Äôs our channel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt5A9Y-b\_TnvG6SKYpcPu3g](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt5A9Y-b_TnvG6SKYpcPu3g) . Thank you!

Shelly‚Äôs super might stun for a little bit, but I‚Äôm not quite sure if that‚Äôs what happened

In Takedown Yes

Any Game Mode That Is Not Takedown No

Looks like Pumpa credit the wrong person

Mm yes i use it as well

Isbhe apout to steal her soul or r*pe her i cant tell? Both are scary.

Even worse than white crow

Also i love ur videos i would love to be in your video!
---
I think he's a boy!
---
I have all mine maxed and I have way to much gold now so it is somewhat balanced just hard work
---
That‚Äôs a good idea too :0
---
Bro I love you
---
I made a new account for that reason too and i got spike at 1k
---
Honestly i disagree with almost everything. Auto-aim makes close distance match easier and thats right, but it still makes the game enjoyable from everybody. Also i think it is dumb to think the new brawlers are added to "make the kids relate"? They are continously added because withot them there wouldnt be any new feature, like without rosa 8 bit or bibi there wouldnt be many new cool features like the shield or anything else. Then about teaming to me there should be total freedom and right now its good how they are handling it because it also helps the solitaires

I‚Äôm in this picture too

I feel like your flair should be Spike instead of Poco
---
I trying to not touch other brawlers with low powercubes but when they start shooting me i don't have a choice
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
Yeah I get that a lot
---
Anyways there are 11 out of all the 30 brawlers in Brawl Stars
---
I... I don't want to talk about that freak alright?!...
---
I know that
---
It's just a humor
---
The thumbnails show stuff that is impossible and the health bar is like 1 0 0 0 0 on a brawler
---
We need more Christmas maps owo
---
....what?
---
I posted this art on it but this is not a repost on my opnion
---
Now i dare you to remodel jessie
---
the new brawl talk will be most likely to come few days after the brawl-o-ween event ends
---
Hammod habbi
---
I know,but some people really put effort making fanarts,and screenshots get more noticed.It's really bad since a screenshot is very easy to make,you know?
---
I mean, it's still a repost since you posted the same thing twice.
---
Unless the OP tells me that....I disagree
---
Looks the same as my post
---
me three
---
Snake prairie.
---
Com certeza

I‚Äôd rather it be a teddy bear for Christmas

üò¢ very creative touches my soul

No √® un meme dedicato a noi alfa /s

Where does the template come from?
---
Oh my, this pleases the iDaves
---
Removing one Western-themed Brawler does not make a difference. Most of the game is based on it. That's not a proper excuse.
---
I hate when people think it‚Äôs not your drawing even tho they don‚Äôt have any evidence
---
i‚Äôm sorry for all these *bad* comments... your art is fuckin amazing i wish you all the best
---
69 jokes , No Legendary Brawlers , Bad Randoms , Reposts
---
sure
---
But still,screenshots are more noticed
---
Very nice Veterans Day art!

Your submission, found at https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/duzgi0/some_incredibly_skilled_players_with_their_s/, was removed from /r/BrawlStars because of Rule 7:No  recruiting of any kind. There is /r/BrawlRecruit available 24/7, for both players and bands.

See You in hot :)

lol here you go u/lexmobilegaming

I've become the whole thing i swore to destroy
---
i mean i come on this sub looking for gameplay highlights, news, tips and stuff related to gameplay. 
---
just because people put hard work and time into something, doesn't always mean it'll be well received and praised. could just make another sub for Brawl Stars fan art.
---
oh boy
---
I mean, I already emailed it to him too ahahah
---
Wow haha no one knew this before omg
---
Hahaha can't wait I find these oddly satisfying
---
Sure ain‚Äôt mythic
---
Git gud
---
It literally is. Supercell doesn't want a pure western theme. Removing his old style is justified
---
wow XD
---
You could definately replace screenshots with low-effort memes. I did a test and created a low-effort meme that literally made no sense at all and it got tenfold the upvotes of my high-effort text post. Most people will immediately upvote when they see a post that looks like it could be a meme.
---
Is that water!
---
Really,i thought that it goes to r/shittybrawlstars,well,thx man)))
---
r/lostredditors
---
I agree with you
---
Agree they should not be in Power Play because the respawns are random making these game modes entirely random. If SC can figure out a fairer way of respawning then I wouldn't mind having them in the rotation.
---
Glad to hear that :)
---
today i was playing takedown with bull and literally every single piper jessie and colt was attacking me while boss had no shield
---
Oh, thank you :'D ‚ú®
---
Respect him, he is using internet explorer
---
It's NNN stop with the hot redheads
---
This is basically a Carl attack, Shelley super, and Tick‚Äôs and Barley‚Äôs star power. Unoriginal ._.
---
One question though, why does leon have a 8 pack?
---
#MORTIS, BRINGER OF DOOM
---
Supercell give at 1k players Leggendaries

Whats the point of posting this though
---
Somebody make Russia
---
Omg cute
---
Nah fam its great
---
well yeah but the chances seem to be astronomically small. also why was i the boss 3/4 times with frank (who is terrible as the boss) and zero times as leon/penny?
---
well yes, you have a good point. but why was i boss as frank 75% of the time but as leon/penny i was the boss zero times?
---
I know
---
I mean. Absolutely none of your brawler choices were smart. But seriously. It‚Äôs just luck. I had 5 in a row as big with Jessie once. And then went an entire weekend without ever being big.
---
**Remember** all the soldiers that died in the World Wars trying to defend their countries.
---
**Remember** all the Brawlers that died to Shelly's Super trying to defend their trophies.
---
BTW, nice art!
---
I‚Äôm aware :)
---
(Although, for the record, the super was designed to be more like bo or sandy‚Äôs main attack than shelly‚Äôs super)
---
move the cactuses and the barrels a bit to avoid 1 tile gaps around the mid btw great map
---
To be fair, much of it is coming from delusional artists.
---
Rip jessie
---
Super! Super!! Super!!!

Are you aware that this is supposed to be a repost? Or are you just stealing it? The template I mean
---
Also anime moments be like
---
Ngl looking kinda nice
---
It‚Äôs just luck I guess
---
As soon as I saw this I was like "please no one saw furry colt". I open comments first thing I see "furry colt"
---
He doesn't have enough wins to have that many trophies, which means a lot of 2nd places to get all those trophies
---
Oh really? Perhaps something like... this?

"how deep does the rabbit hole go?"

Oh
---
MuCh WoW, mAnY bEaUtIfUl.
---
Correct. But if you do it a second time, you still have a 1/12 chance of a 6 and heads coming up.
---
Take my upvote and leave
---
Wow dude, thats dirty, who tf would draw that?
---
Same! Look at my latest post
---
I like lone star but not as power play due to rng.
---
yeah but getting 6+heads both times means 1/144 chance
---
why is there a dot on the upvote sign? I dont get it

"I dont even know who you are"

And you will burn in the 9th circle of hell for that very sole fact

Am I the only one that's getting my front page full of fan art? Really stops me wanting to browse the subreddit. I'd much rather see highlights and good memes.

I wish they would add a fanart filter like on other subreddits

For me its 8-bit and brock

Coincidental shading... nothing to see here people

Colt with colt is made of colt

Don‚Äôt tell me I doesn‚Äôt feel great to kill a tick that has been annoying the entire game
---
*their. I'm not trying to insult you.
---
U forgot the scar in the eye, but this art is very nice.
---
Deserves more upvotes
---
Good point, another idea could be his attack is the same as Frank‚Äôs, but, because he jumps into the air, his damage is 360¬∞ around him. 
---
Also, he could leave a ring of say, 8 land mines at points around the damage circle.
