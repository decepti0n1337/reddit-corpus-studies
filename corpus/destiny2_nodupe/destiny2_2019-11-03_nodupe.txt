I‚Äôve been using it in PvP lately. Having some fun with it.

Very late, but i use the curated braytech werewolf, combined with loaded question and whisper of the worm.

The only amendment I would make is for Gambit Prime exclusively; Try not to be the first people to bank, and always try to bank at the same time as someone else, or when there is already a blocker up. Requires a bit of watching your teammates. Multiple blockers at one time drain the bank, so pairing a 5 with another 5 can be more potent for motes than continuing to gather and waiting until you have 10. Not impossible to get an effective deposit of 15+ from dropping a 5 because of the drain in Prime.
---

---
As far as the first deposit goes, you're playing a bit of chicken with the other team. Watching their "available to deposit" bar on the HUD. You dont want to deposit first, so that you can drain them, unless they're about to be able to deposit 25+ and hit you with an invasion. At that point it becomes a "bank them or lose them". It could be argued that as soon as your team can do 25+ in one go, to deposit and invade - but making that decision really relies on watching what your teammates have decided to do. I prefer to wait until the last moment against the other teams ability to invade.

‚ÄúYou can put your rock in my maps now. I won‚Äôt need them anymore.‚Äù

Just be happy that you don't have to do the entire red war campaign

40+ in 3v3. 150+ in 6s

Doesn't it say that it increases the weapon drop rate in the pit?
---
If your talking about trove guardian, he has another spawn point that switches per week. Its somewhere north if I remember correctly.
---
No prob dude! I‚Äôm not a mod or anything, just watching out for my fellow guardians (the guy in your post IS an idiot tho lmao)
---
Oh man, please tell me you have a collection of Eris research material you could share.. I uh. Have some desires.
---
Yeah its a no. Has to be in a normal match
---
I think it's around the hellmouth, which I'm aware of. This is the only one where i know where the path spawns, though.
---
Get your rock, off my map

Good old Blow Job Johnson, taking care of the stressed one at a time.

That is pretty awesome

As the high dude I have to disagree, for me it‚Äôs getting side tracked and winding up in the wrong area (GoS and SotP each and every)
---
I‚Äôm pretty good with Scathe, I am out rifle ‚Äúalmost‚Äù anyone. The best perks for an AR to have is anything that helps with stability, recoil or sway. An AR with either Zen Moment, Dynamic Sway Reduction is a must. Or one with both of them... near a God Tier roll. Usually the AR‚Äôs with 600 rounds per minute is the Goldilocks zone I think lol.
---
This week he spawns on the hellmouth near where the portal public event happens
---
Until they get their hand held super nova
---
Idk, maybe I'm just not that good with it because I just felt it was a bit under powered at range, I can control recoil, but it hits hard at smg range and well.. I'd rather have the recluse or pillager for that lol cool gun tho and was RIDICULOUSLY OP in d1
---
Resilience is probably the last thing you want... 
---
intellect and recovery/mobility are great stats
---
You should look for armor with a total of around 60 if you want a really good armor.
---
The armor element depends on what mods you use and what weapons you use
---
Look in the wiki for information, which element is for what weapons
---
Edit:
---
Raids often give great high stat armor, as does the hardest nightfall ordeal

The recluse needs nerfed because it's fucking busted. I can probably count on one hand how many times I've been pissed off by the Recluse in PvP. It's strong in PvP sure, but that's also not why anyone complains about it
---
thats just us taking a poke while hunters and titans are curb stomping each other

Attempted? More like did it. Great job!

I dont know what i just read and im american

For me, I've got a 56hr week and 14 credit hours. I somehow managed to have school and work overlap only one day of the week! I get all my hours in Fri-Mon and have all morning classes Mon-Thurs. I have time after classes Tues-Thurs to do essentially anything which I do *not* take for granted.
---
Edit: class days
---
Imagine being a chad and only using fighting lion inside momentum control

WOW

Those exotics are sweet!

Ty ty I'm quite proud of this hahahaha

This is actually super good!

It was a üíØ homemade effort, I watched her obsess over it so I‚Äôll vouch for her.

*not sure how this deserves a downvote as I know her IRL but okay üëåüèºüòÇ
---
Ye i figured it out, but thank you nonetheless.
---
I know this post is dead and has since been fixed but I wanted to mark these words here as it did infact not fix the issue when the update was due (but has been fixed in shadowkeep)
---
I think it was Byf that was tortured by really wanting but never getting the chicken emote, this is their nightmare
---
What are you talking about? Is this a joke? Just wait a few seconds. It'll load.
---
Which dance is that?
---
I think it's gonna be finished within the next 2 resets, were gonna get a vex invasion within the next few weeks
---
Erentil makes them even more cancerous.
---
Every week, we get 1 more meta. But the worst part is that some of the best pve weps are crucible quests...
---
Okay, boys, here's the plan.
---
1. I briefly explain the encounter
---
2. We wipe \~2-4 times to consolidate knowledge
---
3. We complete the ecounter
---
Such approach is honestly the best. The worst people are those who can't stand even one wipe.
---
Your post was removed due to our rule that explicitly prohibits DM, PM, and chat screen shots.

Push to talk exists for a reason.

If you're ever looking for a triumph to claim. Look for the one on the triumphs page with a white symbol on it.
---
As a player in his first week, yes.
---
This is better than the actual game.
---
It were an achievement post right? As the reason stated above, those aren't meant to be here. Sorry if this upsets you.
---
What do you mean by ‚Äúwhere you belong‚Äù, if you‚Äôre saying mmr doesn‚Äôt translate to actual matchmaking? 
---
Interesting though.
---
I literally never understood why it was that he permanently died after being an EXO, like what? They dont have backups being constantly streamed to a server which they can use to "respawn"? Whats the point of being an exo?
---
I just can‚Äôt wait to be done with it! Hopefully should get it within the next 2 days
---
Attunement of Fission is solid tho.
---
As somebody who did the recluse grind very recently (and from the experiences of others who've posted in other threads) the matchmaking doesn't seem to be able to make very equal teams based on the MMR (or ELO, whatever the term is). Generally matches I did were stomps in one direction or the other, and apparently fairly low-glory players can be put against unbrokens if the system decides to give up and just put the players in a match.
---
You should definitely do that cynical smile pose from the recent cinematic, you're already killing it!!
---
Alters of Sorrow has to be the best way for sure. Before that it would‚Äôve been escalation protocol. You also get one chocolate strange coin for each tier completed. Alters of Sorrow is also really good to get phantasmal fragments. I constantly have a full stack in my post master.
---
&gt;Do you get Enya ...
---
Yup. Sure do.
---
I ran arblest in the master nightmare hunt and it took 4-5 shots to lower a harpy shield vs 2 shots from borealis to drop it. So if you transfer that knowledge to What arblest could do to barrier shields assuming it can even damage them
---
r/perfectlybalanced
---
I like how you instinctively fired at the envoy after you killed that guardian. Good man!
---
You don't, Bungie decided to get rid of these and seasonal armor for no apparant reason other than the fact that they want you to buy it with silver. You can get nostalgic engrams, which give you ships, sparrows, emotes etc. They don't give you armor though.
---
Funny. I‚Äôve always posted his stuff. 
---
Arbitrary rule changes. It‚Äôs cool. I‚Äôll post it somewhere he can get the recognition he deserves üòÇ
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure you can still do it, it‚Äôs hard though be prepared
---
i have but like i said, what we got is good but its definitely not bungies best. comparing it to D1 armor just looks sad.
---
Is there anything specifically not mentioned above that you‚Äôd like us to add?
---
In theory that works, but I would have just suppressed myself, plus he could just leave the bubble.
---
I was so confused I thought mine bugged out. Didn't realize there was a triumphs tab on the CHARACTER menu! You're a lifesaver
---
Not up to a certain resilience % though.
---
I have Destiny 2 vanilla free from Playstation Plus. Apparently it has now been updated to be Destiny 2 and first two expansions. So Forsaken and Shadowkeep are separate SKUs. If I want to play the campaign in those, do I need to buy both or does buying Shadowkeep give both campaigns since it is the latest?
---
What would be wrong about suppressing yourself in the process? I do it all the time to shut down supers pushing me.
---
You can start the quest by going to Eris wearing a mask. The quest chain starts from there.
---
I would be easy pickings for another guardian. Plus on scenarios like this the hunter could leave the bubble and come back.
---
AAAAA when you could change elements
---
You fiend
---
Haven't ran into anyone I couldn't one shot out of a super and I have played alot this season 4 resets and 5500 in comp
---
Same. I played competitive in the first couple of seasons but quickly stopped due to consistently being placed against 3 and 4 stacks. I started playing freelance comp and I‚Äôm about to reset my glory for the first time! Just got Randy‚Äôs Throwing Knife and I‚Äôm also one step away from Redrix.  Never thought I‚Äôd get this far in PvP but I‚Äôm actually enjoying it now.
---
Just got the fighting lion today and decided to try it out in momentum, it was indeed not creative but at least it was fun
---
What sniper are you using? I might be using the wrong ones.
---
nice shots!
---
You have to buy both to play those campaigns
---
I can physically hear your brain making the noise that you only hear when you take out the plug that are on inflatable‚Äòs.
---
Sadly I‚Äôve made posts with the same reasons. I‚Äôve had team mates with a  .3 kd before while I‚Äôm doing my best to carry with 29 kills. The worst part was that it was in mythic 2 where you wouldn‚Äôt be expecting really bad blueberries.
---
Architects are drunk again
---
I know, I love those weaps!
---
Yeah but your bubble doesn‚Äôt go away when your suppressed plus inside your bubble you have bonus melee damage
---
Midnight smith for armor, shadows mask helmet
---
The quest where you had to listen to all of caydes goodbye tapes hit me so fucking hard
---
I know it is slower rpm snipers that do it like revoker or beloved
---
This is the correct answer right here, was having a really hard time finding shaders that don't look weird on those weapons until I tried bloody tooth, makes most of them look gr8.
---
That's true, but my point is that there are so many weapons that are viable now due to the game mode that recluse sticks out as "the one gun that everyone uses because they're going hard" in a playlist made to be just stupid fun. I mean I saw people using skyburners oath and sidearms because they weren't hot garbage anymore.
---
Btw I am on console so that probably does change my experience compared to anyone on PC.
---
Oh ok, I‚Äôll try when I have the grenade next time then.
---
[https://www.niris.tv/blog/hpe](https://www.niris.tv/blog/hpe)
---
What is faster
---
I haven‚Äôt tried revoker against supers but what perks would you recommend on beloved?
---
He said, while sitting in a bubble for heavy. There's nothing wrong with arcstrider. That arcstrider also got extremely lucky to not die.
---
No this is *Patrick*!
---
Yeah for some reason getting high level powerfuls before 950 can reward 951 but no higher than that so lucky you dude :)
---
Yup, so get a team when it‚Äôs the nightfall and speed run it
---
Of course I did
---
Looks like you gotta stop playing now, hope you had fun!
---
I love it :)
---
Yes guardian
---
You‚Äôre playing momentum control, people are grinding for Randy‚Äôs and the mountaintop, once the majority of people have it you‚Äôll just be running up against recluses and 110 handcannons
---
I couldn't help but notice that most of the Titans Suck memes seem to be made by Hunters...
---
*cries*
---
i was banned from the discord because of my cousin i have no clue on how i got banned from the game
---
My favorite memory was the guy who played the Space Jam theme song during the opening sequence of Kings fall. Dunking orbs on aliens, just felt right
---
3 hunters?
---
Its not a bug really, pinnacle rewards drops +5 prior to 950 so if you are at least 946 it will drop at 951.
---
It's always fitted the definition of an MMO (an online mutliplayer/cooperative RPG), but Bungie only recently started calling it that. They stated sometime after leaving Activision that the publisher was part of the reason they didn't want to call it an MMO (they didn't explain why, though.)
---
1. Most people go for it for the title
---
2. Just do the kills in momentum control. It took me about 20ish games and got from 14-100 percent
---
Randy's is definitely for pvp. It's not a pve weapon.
---
You need to have finished the campaign on that char for it to open.
---
I can't believe you survived that
---
One of the best exotic heavy machine guns? You mean of the two?
---
Three old raids are all 750
---
I found this today as well
---
You forgot about the guy who is saying ‚Äúlaggy game how did I die?‚Äù
---
What an Alpha lmao. This kid is going places
---
It's been so well received by the community, it's 100% coming back
---
I mean youre in a well.
---

---
Celestial, top tree tether, well with lunafaction boots. This is pretty much the only thing I ever see in Raids.
---
Literally flung my controller when I saw it
---
Oof. Yeah I‚Äôm always scared that I sound like a 12 yo. Worst part is that I‚Äôm always the Sherpa so it‚Äôs extra stressful
---
Have been doing it today, 100 discipline with hallowfire heart, grenade every 2-3 seconds.  Not broken at all
---
The meta is always changing. Izanagi used to be considered trash. Now it's BiS for kinetic. I'm going to get it, even though I hate scout rifles, just in case
---
Would‚Äôve been cool if they added a few strange coins inside or something but it‚Äôs whatever
---
Pinnacle drop. You get to branch 9 on the Haunted Forrest?
---
still have to get the 14k medals and 2100 glory to get it. sure momentum is stupid easy mode for the scout rifle kills but still have to do comp and get a metric f**k ton of medals
---
everyone really discredits nova warp, but when used w/ astrocyte visage it can create some absolute insane movement / plays.
---
I myself would rather use bomb but you go
---
No. You need to do them all
---
Capturing and power plays are almost as important as murders in Control. Your teammates clearly don‚Äôt get it.
---
Oh def, and this is not me it's [https://twitch.tv/gamer](https://twitch.tv/gamer) \- just a friend.
---
Bomb is more reliable, and devour is great for outnumbered situations in PvP!
---
Veteran D1 player: got D2 since it was free. Had it for less than a month. My main question is this: are our old factions just for show now and not actually useful? I‚Äôm talking about New Monarchy, Dead Orbit, and Future Warcult. They‚Äôre around the tower but I can‚Äôt join them or anything. Am I missing something or that‚Äôs just it? 
---
Also, what happened to the iron temple? Why couldn‚Äôt the vanguard use that. It had connections to the vault and a whole bunch of other cool stuff and seemed like it was far enough away from the city.
---
Yea
---
amen to that bro
---
bro üòéüí™
---
Meh.
---
it's not a scam.
---
Bungie won't do anything about the laggers, reporting them doesn't seem to do anything either
---
I enjoyed him standing still scoping in, jk jiggle peek
---
And I suddenly feel like playing the mode again. Shaxx mask, here I come.
---
serious case of OCD. get help.
---
They didn‚Äôt even get the killing part. Lol.
---
Not the ones bought by silver
---
Ohh is it. Damn I was going nuts thinking that I screwed up somewhere. Thanks a lot :)
---
How did most people know this? It was never detailed.
---
That one team that does the first damage phase flawlessly but then fuck up the second phase and whipe over and over again
---
Yeah but the thing is that I run WotW in the Heavy and Recluse in Energy and I'm having fun with them. Just need a Kinetic that pairs with those.
---
I would use that for dps on bosses then and since you‚Äôve got an exotic slot I would recommend throwing on the Thunderlord if you have it and if not 21% delirium, just something for general add clear
---
You are indeed right, I'm a new light player and I tried crucible and got absolutely raped by OEM titans
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Then you‚Äôre what‚Äôs wrong always going for 15 motes then dying. Mist the time you have to put 5 in max to get an invasion off before they do it‚Äôs not always about sending a knight in
---
Then a pulse rifle or a scout rifle, the last boss encounter promotes you sitting back and hitting the bosses in the head and the third room can be hell without a proper long range weapon
---
Yeah no the hood is white but the lighting around her character is generally atmospheric and so you don‚Äôt often have the ability to tell
---
Thank you. I would WAY rather deal with a Knight than a Captain.
---
Every match? Have you considered you're part of that problem? 
---
Only depositing at 15? You need to be more adaptive if you're not in a pre-made.
---
I‚Äôm with him it‚Äôs much better to put in 5s and 10s because the knight is a joke to kill. The captains are brutal if there‚Äôs a couple of them. And you can pretty accurately determine where the invader is going to spawn because it will never spawn them on the side of PVE and it will try to keep them as far away as possible from the majority of your team, so you should always know exactly where they‚Äôre coming from and honestly if you want to be scummy, run tractor cannon as your heavy and spawn kill them.
---
Yes please. I'm a recently returning player and that thing is damn hilarious. I'm definitely saving up my bright dust in case it comes back.
---
It has a bug where it resets slower than it's supposed to, so even if we melee each other at the same exact time, you'll get your second melee off before I do.
---
Clearly this isn't going the way OP had planned. 
---
Came to complain about other blueberries only to find out he is that blueberry on the team that is letting everyone down.
---
No, super buffs do not stack with other supers. Bungie said so before shadowkeep launched.
---
That‚Äôs not your nightfall rewards. That‚Äôs the additional armour reward from the season pass!
---
and then you get your fifth damn aeon soul
---
I'm well aware. I hate that it's posted everywhere. We all get that it's not fun to fight against, but also like, *we all get that it's not fun to fight against*.

The funniest thing is I got the idea to make this weeks ago.

Used up too much time setting up that melting point. Close though.

There are no Jade Rabbit users. There are only people who looked at the catalyst requirements and thought 'fuck that' til now.

250 kills later it'll sit in the vault again with a nice yellow border XD

Sounds about right. I don't really post here to begin with though. I just scroll through looking for memes or helping out people who are confused or don't know where to find something /we. I've been playing destiny for a long time so I try to help out others who might not know the game as well

Perhaps the gameplay is "shallow" to you based on your gaming background, but the quality of the gameplay, specifically the gunplay is an 11/10. 
---
To me, the gameplay of Destiny, regarding the variety of missions (patrol, quests, missions, strikes, dungeons, raids, etc.), the existence of classes, the existence and flexibility of subclasses, inventory management, material gathering, and the complexity of the top level activities blew my mind in 2014 and has now completely overwhelmed me to the point that I have quit playing due to time it demands to stay relevant in game. 
---
Personally, coming from other FPS games (Halo), fighting games (Soul Calibur), and action adventure or platforming games (Zelda, Mario), Destiny blows them all away in the "shallowness" of gameplay category. 
---
I guess if you are coming from a serious MMO background that you might feel Destiny is shallow,  but otherwise, I think that you are out of your mind if you think that.
---
It's entirely rng based. Mine dropped right after I got Cerberus +1. Had the gun and catalyst drop in the same escalation protocol, which was super lucky, but I dont really use the gun.
---
Got to love that search bar.
---
This post is referring to the Hive Boomer weapon. The arc grenade launcher weapons that Knights and some Acolytes use...
---
Despite all enemies having the same amount of damage increase in stuff like raids and master nightfalls dying by a hive boomer is still far more enraging
---
Is it like a forsaken weapon, cos I don't have that expansion yet

I enjoyed doing it. I died a lot but I was helpful at least. Are you on console or PC? Because I'd love to do it again if you're interested.
---
If it has good rolls, one fusion with a high level item would make it awesome. Most high level items that drop have shit rolls, so I'd rather have a low one with nice rolls.

someone explain to me why people are upset about jade rabbit in particular? it seems like a lot of scouts one hit kill with a headshot

Prospector is good
---
META BAD!!
---
Who cares. Play against him and then get over it. It's not a bad thing to use a good loadout. You shouldn't feel like you can't use the meta because you don't wanna upset the enemy. Sure it's annoying but you don't have to screenshot it and post it on reddit you salty nerd.
---
its pretty fun when he just teleports infront of u when u pick up a few motes, i mountaintopped his ass 3 times
---
This isn‚Äôt impressive in the least. I was expecting a triple kill or something but it‚Äôs just you spamming enemy spawn.

I call it gun mayhem.

The kill was timed perfectly with the pause

I‚Äôve only done 1 match the last 2 weeks and I got 80 both times... I lost both please don‚Äôt haze me lol but that‚Äôs how I know exactly where the glory I have this season came from I do remember you used to have to do 3 matches to get a bonus and u may get more based on how much you play but I‚Äôd hate to think with 3 matches would only give you 120 when 1 lose and you still get 80

Lol .. but it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me hope it helps

Mods that we had from the start aren‚Äôt listed as obtained
---
Nice! It‚Äôs not an easy task, welcome to the end game hunter.
---
I run higher purpose for add clearing and switch to energetic assassin for terrors. Run anarchy for constant DPS on terrors. My current setup is Shadowshot trapper-Orpheus. I think my main problem is fireteam. I don‚Äôt have a clan and LFG still basically gives you random people. Know of any good clans? Lol
---
As a hunter, I've totally done this before.  The posts are my saviour... Every time I see a super, I just run for a post.
---
Honestly J√∂tunn isn't all that great, a hunter dodge or just getting behind something is enough to stop it
---
I think my favorite part of D1 was the Age of Triumph at the end, when everything was at light level and you could play any raid and mix and match the gear. Best time of destiny's existence, with shadowkeep giving me heavy AoT vibes.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-post. stop being awful.
---
I believe two will get 1 more expansion and will be supported with new seasons then bungie‚Äôs new game will come out and a few years after that we‚Äôll get D3
---
Xbone D1, PC D2.
---
All this fan arts of AoS really make me wanna finally do the questline for it I just hate PvP on D2 and 6/25 hand canon finishers I just cba üòÇüòÇ
---
Dope af drawing tho ü§ô
---
I was given helm, chest, and energy weapon all in 790s. Screw it, uninstalling. I‚Äôm not troubleshooting this glitch, it‚Äôs just a downer.
---
Thanks for trying to help!
---
Nice job dude!
---
Rest in Pepperoni Cayde...
---
I've been feeling the same, the amount of times I can near enough land them dead center of the explosion and either hit a 150 or even hit nothing at all is ridiculous.
---
The combo's pretty fun! In the end I killed far more with Drang than with Sturm since it was so fun to stack so many bullets in Sturm. But I think they intended players to switch back and forth between the guns so one does not need to reload, which is pretty fun as well.
---
Would be insane if the damage had stacked as well, but of course that would break the game, so that kind of thing only happens in Warframe, not Destiny xD
---
Google my friend.
---
... but don't I get back HP when I kill someone with handheld supernova?
---
I dont think they will nerf them
---
&gt; Blacks are more reliable voters than boomers are....
---
No. They had a 10+% higher turnout in the last presidential election and account for 23% of the US population vs adult blacks making up 12*%. Even accounting for the blacks that are baby bloomers themselves non-black bloomers are still the larger voting bloc. 
---
That's not to mention that they're more consistent in what they vote for. Which you could write a whole thesis on that subject.
---
I believe any aniper rifle is a one-shot no matter what....might be wrong tho
---
I feel you. I had done each part of the raid 36 times but never actually completed it like. I‚Äôd do dogs, pool, and run but never calus. I never got to do calus (work and real life always got in the way). I finally got into a team/clan and my first raid wasn‚Äôt even the one I‚Äôd been practicing. We did GOS, but it felt amazing to finally get a raid complete.
---
I don't know about PSN, but on Xbox I already had the free dlc installed and they were ready to play the moment I "bought" them from thicc goddess Amanda Holliday.  FYI: Forsaken isn't free. It's still pay to play. The third free campaign is The Red War (the day one D2 campaign).

Be better with the drifter mask lol

---
Is it just me or is this post missing "the person who spams rocket/grenade launcher"
---
Yeah I don't think you can. Seems like such a design flaw.
---
It‚Äôs pretty solid tho, mid range autos are alright in QP
---
Nope
---
Brought to you by Raid: SHADOW Legends.
---
If you look at the season pass then scroll through to level 80 or so an exotic fated engram will be listed. Inspect that engram and it will show the loot table
---
There is plenty to do, they‚Äôre likely aiming to get all the titles or even collectibles, so they try and do everything, raids, strikes, Gambit, Crucible, nightfall, even open-world objectives. TL;DR there‚Äôs a lot of stuff to do
---
Crucible
---
Explain why? Seen one guy today dominating survival Freelance with sidearm
---
No, but i think you need season pass at least, (correct me if im wrong)
---
You don‚Äôt need much, I‚Äôve got a ryzen 2400g, 8gb 2666 ddr4, and a RX 580 4gb, total price was like $500 ish and it runs at 1080p on high easily (80-100fps)
---
yes please, we already have:
---
+ The Fallen's laser pointer and instant death burst rifle;
---
+ The Cabal's angry peas shooter;
---
+ The Taken's Worm Whisperer;
---
Could we please get a Hive knight's arc grenade launcher and a Vex Goblin's close range low RoF high impact smg ?
---
I'll even put some ideas down for the sake of it
---
# Knight's Prowess, exotic grenade launcher:
---
+ Intrinsic exotic perk: Slow firing, high blast radius arc projectile;
---
+ Second exotic perk: Projectiles fired from this weapon suffer a more pronounced arc in their trajectory. Projectiles damage greatly increases, the more they travel until they hit an enemy;
---
#Fanatic's Slap Rifle (or just bring back vex mythoclast already ffs):
---
+ Intrinsic exotic perk: Change firing mode: semi auto, high impact/high range solar scout rifle, or automatic close range high impact/low RoF solar smg;
---
 + Second exotic perk: Precision hits have a chance to summon a debuff zone near the target, weakening enemies' solar resitance inside it;
---
Midnight coup is relatively good, especially for ad clearing. It's from the leviathan raid.
---
Oh damn, guess I‚Äôm just the boomer then for not getting it
---
Drifter's Ship. Its a screenshot from the Gambit intro Cutscene. Although, the spooky decorations does make me want to say the Tower, Drifter's room is not that big.
---
It‚Äôs not a theory, that‚Äôs literally what is is. Mods that were already unlocked from the start such as minor, major, boss resist or any elemental resist aren‚Äôt shown as collected.
---
And the catalyst I believe
---
If someone has whispers disabled, I don't believe there is a way.
---
I played games since the damn things where invented.
---
There where no damn fps nor 3d graphics when i started playing. 
---
The only thing the store told you was that the triumph needed to be completed. 
---
completed does not mean the same as being claimed in any damn way shape or form in the English language. 
---
Bungie is hardly the only developers who have no clue about clarity when it comes text in games but small mistakes like this is annoying as hell.
---
Nah, should be able to get to 950 since powerful gear (needed to go beyond 950) can be gained elsewhere too (such as fully clearing Escalation Protocol on Mars)
---
That doesn't give progress for Randy's.
---
So if your doggo barfs, do lots of other doggos come running?
---
If something from Eververse is not available in the Eververse store, you cannot get it. 
---
I am not sure if the pinnacle weapon ornaments ever show up in the bright dust rotation each week.
---
You did it wrong. Not Xurs fault.
---
Man in just tryna get my mountaintop
---
You need to actually defeat Riven and then do the Queenswalk, but yes, it will count as a completion even though you didn't do the earlier raid encounters.
---
This guy gets it.
---
Best of luck to you friend
---
In the Risk/Reward quest, Ghost mentions that it‚Äôs statistically impossible for all of Cayde‚Äôs secrets to be revealed.
---
You can't escape death
---
Think about it, i hope jade rabbit gets deleated from the game
---
If you play on pc I could teach them to you

What is the Spider Vision Triumph?

[How Xur works and how to get every exotic.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1881576082)
---
When you max out your mums credit card for a game with already built in hacks
---
You can view this on the "known issues" page on the Bungie website where they list all the bugs they are working on.
---
It‚Äôs marked for vengeance
---
I found some people after changing my time but it gives good guns and can even out your armor and gear really quick
---
Also good for vex farm
---
I miss having knives everywhere
---
You guys realize that's where you fight the bosses right?
---
Music: John Wick Medley - Le Casle Vania
---
You can also use the wish to get a free token so you can open more than one chest
---
That‚Äôs actually the very map I got mine. Was with graviton lance
---
Defiantly got hate from his teammates. My blood pressure rose from all that salt.
---
Its a triumph that says something along the lines of "When a spider crosses your aim"  or something like that
---
Short answer: no
---
Long answer: nah
---
It's a big thing to happen! Grats on your first raid clear, you'll never feel that excited about it again. I still fondly remember my fireteam going through the vault of glass back in the second or third week of d1. It Was Incredible. The environment, the ambiance, the challenge.
---
Think I might've seen you in Gambit.
---
Whether you masterwork things or not is up to you.
---
Ok thanks
---
I think it is, the story is good and the raid is real good, you also get quite a bit of content with it
---
NICE.
---
No, its not very good
---
It isn't a bad choice, in my own opinion. Explosive Payload can be used to mess with people behind cover, when used properly and Snapshot makes up for the low handling.
---
The only thing that a lot of people don't like about this sniper is the high zoom factor, but for bigger maps, snipers like that aren't a bad choice.
---
Just play with it for a few games and see if you like it for PvP.
---
For PvE, it doesn't have the highest DPS for legendary snipers but it does a lot more damage per shot, especially with exp-rounds. Could be quite helpful for dealing with major enemies that need to die fast, if you don't want to use Izanagi and instead use the exo-slot for something else
---
Dattos video goes over all of them
---
Looooooooove it!!!!!
---
Yes they found a bug in it a week or so back and it's currently locked until fixed...  Guns great and a lot of fun and I hope returns soon... especially if you just got it
---
If you're not working on a catalyst, whisper is fun to use. It gives you like 8 shots per brick
---
Yeah aslong as you dont want to ever play a fire class lol
---
Mainly just gatekeep legend rank in comp. Allow me to wash my feet since I am a console peasant, Almighty one. 
---
My n00b Not Forgotten would like to be introduced as well, PvE scrub
---
gg can only 1 hit other supers if you take bottom tree, and it has to be a headshot, otherwise goldy 2 shots other supers while being slower, squishier, and having a much shorter duration
---
Ah Kvostov
---
Yeah, you know what, when somebody disagrees with you, it‚Äôs probably because they‚Äôre a psychopath. Spot on. 
---
And I‚Äôm the rude one.
---
I mean hunter solar class is still used quite a bit, danwblade is good and hammer of sol has always been solid
---
Did I ever say otherwise?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the one that I just picked up. So do I jest get notes from playing gambit prime?
---
Right, I‚Äôm not preloaded with lumina like all locks have a healing ability. Because it‚Äôs the role.
---
Yes but you were talking about the relic that lacks any perks for fire classes
---
Just asking for people to use their abilities when they should.
---
I mean even you realized you were being an asshole so ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
There is no way to change an existing item, but you can get 2.0 exotic armor from the collections tab by purchasing a copy of the armor.
---
Eyyy this guy gets it
---
Cthulhu
---
Yeah, that was to get people to not use them as much lol. The solar classes dont really need any kind of boost
---
SUROS Regime imo. Pretty good damage output and fast reloads. Not only that it's exotic perk which increases the bottom half mag's damage and Spinning Up makes it a killing machine.
---
Nobody said it takes skill, all I heard is it takes reaction speed xD
---
It's not the role, titans also have support too, so that's now their only usable role according to you.
---
Warlocks are just as valuable doing dps or ad clear as they are running well
---
The name of the secret triumph for the fotl no one know what it is yet but it's called spider vision in the API r/raidsecrets is thinking it will come on the next reset
---
‚ÄúSo‚Äù. So... So?
---
I‚Äôd recommend the aggressive frame kinetic shotgun ‚Äòtoil and trouble‚Äô from Zavala with,  
---
  in my opinion the best roll
---
Barrel: full choke or rifled Barrel  
---
  Magazine: assault mag or accurized Rounds  
---
  Trait: Auto loading holster  
---
  Trait: full auto trigger system
---
Looking into it. 
---
Be easier if locks used their ability to help the team, would make things smoother for the whole team. But yeah, can‚Äôt talk about that.
---
it was either the Vex Offensive smg or the Moon smg
---
No as in he probably just started that character and still has that gear in either his vault or never dismantled if and kept it on his character
---
I don't know why I found this so funny but anyways hey xur. Give me Arabalest already
---
Only thing I hate about it is the HUGE muzzle brake
---
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
That's a bit crap.
---
Bruh what the fuck are you doing looking for ‚Äúrealistic feeling gunplay‚Äù in a game about shooting aliens and robots?  That‚Äôs gotta be the dumbest complaint I‚Äôve heard in a long time.
---
Anyone else having trouble with hammers in the sense that they‚Äôre not being thrown?
---
The dude plays rocket league. I don‚Äôt think he plays games for their ‚Äúdepth‚Äù.
---
It forces you to adapt, change the way you play. I felt the same way, my blade barrage wasn't as great after shadowkeep, but now the nightstalker trees have grown on me.
---
Nice
---
Agreed, every class can offer damage. But to ignore the built n roles of the three classes to justify not doing your part in challenging situations is silly.
---
The warlock has built in abilities that are supposed to be used to offer support heal. I‚Äôm asking that warlocks use it. But that‚Äôs crazy, so I‚Äôll move on.
---
our smokes dont even supress like titans shpulder charge and void grenade lol
---
No . Can you read.
---
fantastic biological meme
---
My point exactly
---
Since when are supers designed to kill other supers? GG is irrefutably the best super if your aim is good. It just has high skill expression unlike bottom tree striker that just mashes buttons in your general direction.
---
What? Gambit prime has 1 round and what are you even trying to show in the picture?  
---
Edit: just seen both teams at 100 motes lol, but still gambit prime only has 1 round.
---
It‚Äôs a joke
---
You need to do public events, lost sectors, and patrols.
---
Geez dude do you want some pepper?
---
Aha... How exactly? And in fact, what was your point? That I‚Äôm stupid for stating my opinion?
---
Outbreak perfected
---
Wait a minute
---
I have dreads
---
How have I not thought of this before
---
No it's not crazy, but one, *one*, subclass out of 9 offers team healing. This is not a built in role, its one option out of nine built in roles. 
---
I run well for Reckoning myself, but running nova to deal with majors or stormtrance for ads are just as viable.
---
There is no ‚Äúbest weapon‚Äù in this game. Honestly it‚Äôs one of its beauties. Experiment with what you like and use that more.
---
i think its in the worst state its been in in a very very long time  
---
some of the good things are that the other classes finally have a way to do deal with titans but the bad side to that is every thing they have to use to combant the titans make them scum bags as welll which just turns the entire crucible in a non fun unless game mode in my opinion
---
That‚Äôs all of reddit not just this community. 
---
Correcting and downvoting you to put you in your place /s
---
Hover over the vendor at the bottom Right on the director.
---
Come on chaps. Like we have never had that "super" panic. It is hilarious though.
---
Did you pre-order shadowkeep? If not then you had a bug and it didn't actually unlock.
---
I just need to know how to get a bow :(
---
What mission were you doing ?
---
Ah. Good, someone saved him from fortnite
---
So slow it speeds up in hand to hand combat
---
Congrats bro
---
Yea I'm using Tranquility and Whisper for now. I am a New Light player so there has never once a time that I played that I could've done the quest. It's unfortunate what's happening....
---
Too bad it's horribly balanced.
---
Unless it goes the way of trials and faction rallies. Into the nether, never to return.
---
Season of the Undying Trevor
---
That‚Äôs cool I guess
---
How difficult would you say GoS is compared to other raids
---
Finding friends, staying up past bed time. Energy drinks. White Russians. Coffee. Finding people who‚Äôve been to legend before and help. Main thing is communication. It‚Äôs more fun to talk to people when you‚Äôre playing comp. Plus that cooperation makes for a better team. Like when you join a two stack v a three stack and the three stack team shoots you to hell. Be that three stack.
---
You will not be able to solo the Leviathan. Guided games isn‚Äôt reliable even if it is available, so I would suggest doing an LFG
---
nephew, what're you smoking? what kinda idea is THAT..
---
I miss Sonic drive thru mozzarella sticks and Zip‚Äôs burgers from my summer visiting my husband in the states
---
Is Sturm great with anything other than drang? I feel like the reloading any energy weapon just feels wasted on a legendary.
---
At least to buy it from xur you need forsaken, so not all blueberry titans will flock to it as soon as he puts the oem on sale
---
Id recommend stopping now so you dont get more downvotes bud.
---
Congrats bro if you‚Äôre on ps4 ill run scourge of the past with you
---
Don‚Äôt wait, travel back and forth
---
Congrats
---
Nice! also be proud of your language, nothing wrong with spanish or anything different!
---
Ohhhhh it looks cool, thanks for telling me
---
Nah, to calus' mini ship on nessus or to the edgebois' (DO) club
---
He is exactly right though.You could have used the search bar to find the answer instead of making a post about it.There is about 100+ posts about it
---
*‚ÄùI felt that comment in my bones!‚Äù*
---
Atleast i am not the only one thinking that ;-)
---
Tbh they should remove aim assist as a stat entirely either from this mode, crucible, or just the entire game for PC.
---
Better work on getting the randomly rolled ones then because you can't infuse an event reward, how it's always been.
---
maybe three times? at least a couple

Could someone explain the monster energy drink thing to me?
---
I ordered like ~6 cases and now I'm wondering if I'm supposed to drink it in secret.
---
I'm really struggling to get the doubles, got the 3 in one life + total kills before I'd broken 20% on the doubles one, no one seems to bunch up in my matches it's all solos running round like headless chickens.
---
Hey OP, judging from the fact that you waited until now, are you a pc player? Just wondering
---
If you can‚Äôt beat em, join em
---
No actually, I‚Äôm a PS4 player
---
Thank you.
---
Is there an in-game LFG feature that I‚Äôve missed, or am I pretty much limited to cruising Discord?
---
NI!
---
Awesome! I‚Äôll read this right away.
---
Xur on his day off
---
Not one in game. If you are on pc, the destiny discord is massive. Xbox has the built in LFG. The D2 companion app also has a good fire team finder
---
I indeed found a better one. Thank you for your concern.
---
There was an exotic in the pot. He was simply growing fat from strength

The only thing i will be looking for from now on, **WHITE RUSSIANS COMRADE**

Find a proper clan. That helps. :)

"don't. Mueve. Let them pass."

It a YouTube video of easter eggs that haven't been solved. There's 1 of Destiny 1
---
You can create a second character and get the quest when completing the triumph and then go to shaxx and get the recluse

---
I just got them both to drop, I'm really enjoying it. I noticed the effect works on Power Machine Guns as well, and its awesome!
---
GG sir
---
Yes theoretically because it is unknown to me if the lore covers the ability for the traveler to bring Sundance (or any other dead ghost) back to life to bring Cayde (or any other touched by the light) back to life.
---
I believe ghosts are crafted specifically for the individual but I may be wrong and don't want to go down a rabbit hole of the possibilities for all that right now.
---
Super easy just ask about CAP, it can triple your damage output
---
You sir, are a grade A dingus. You see that blank space above the picture? You're supposed to put a photo there and the Asher quote (which is funny) is the punchline. Hence the word "template" .
---
In that case, I should‚Äôve chosen to be a hunter instead of a titan lol, cause I love hand cannons in this game
---
Edit: also, is making a new character basically like creating a new game slot?
---
Music was lowkey timed perfectly, but 100% unintentional because I play with it in the background :‚Äô)
---
Ranked PvP is just the two glory playlists, which are Survival, and Survival: Freelance. The big difference between the two is that you can't enter the freelance with anyone else, its the solo queue
---
Radar shouldn't exist to begin with, especially how inconsistent it is sometimes.
---
Sometimes it tells me exactly where my enemy is coming from
---
Sometimes it's completely awful and literally gives me false advise
---
You get tokens for doing stuff in gambit prime/doing prime bounties. From those tokens you use your synthesizer to turn them into motes. At least that's for the weak/middling/powerful motes.
---
crispy indeed
---
If you open up evas inventory on the bottom you will see three masks, but the one for your class, and it says that because that is what you are supposed to do, but haven‚Äôt done it yet
---
Can you sell good exotics please?
---
Ayyyy nice job! My group and I just completed the newest raid last night. You should go and try the other raids now.
---
What was the burst pistol?
---
Wtf is that rule? That is some serious bullshit.
---
There's a leaked cutscene where Uldren is found by a Ghost (probably Pulled Pork, don't ask) at his burial and resurrected, and because he just lost the memory of his past life and is definitely a Hunter, there's been thoughts he'll be the next Vanguard.
---
Ah okay. Thanks.
---
Props to you man, just helped my friend through his very first, it‚Äôs so awesome to see that first raid reaction.

---
As a bald man, I would scalp a fool for a baby fro!
---
One more question if ya dont mind. I noticed that some of the quest like prompt backgrounds will be different colors like yellow and purple for example. What does that mean?
---
I think it‚Äôs Skele-Ghaul. Eververse is selling it
---
Like I said this is my first ever edit that I have ever done. I hope you enjoy this small edit I put together. Also, I would really appreciate it if you guys shared this around due not having a following and would love to have this be featured in a TWAB.
---
even after you've completed all of the speed challenges, its still a random drop from completing nightfalls, and IIRC wont go directly into your inventory, it'll show up in at the postmaster.
---
Maybe from fated engrams?
---
It would also fulfill Cayde's Vanguard dare, the Vanguard themselves would want to keep Uldren on a tight leash, and Mara might be OK with it since pretty much everyone in the Reef want's Uldren's head and the Tower is like day care for her brother.
---
Error: Success!
---
Also, no need to apologize for Spanish!
---
Wait is that a good weapon?
---
(New light)
---
Tim Hortons is so powerful, I fell in love with Canada at a Tim Hortons in Afghanistan
---
Good thing i haven't seen even one of those
---
Crimson. It‚Äôs an exotic that life steals on kill and refills the mag on precision kills. It used to be hot garbage but they buffed the damage and now it‚Äôs super solid.
---
They aren't. Bungie just didn't swap the preview armor. Its back to Year one armor.
---
Congrats buddy. Soon your entire life will be raids and soon will be teaching them. It‚Äôs the circle of guardians.
---
They might as well not be guardians at that point. It could easily be the humans of the farm. They're still out there, after all, trying to reclaim the edz. Look at Devon.
---
How
---
Can confirm, i cant buy any forsaken guns because im a new light newb.
---
Honestly dude I don't even know
---
We did have control in comp, It was shit. Just wait a little bit Elimination will replace survival once they finish testing it
---
Yea I was going the guardian route because they would still have exotics
---
its because its free
---
They‚Äôve said it‚Äôs something they‚Äôd definitely like to do and may look into, but it‚Äôs not something coming any time soon if at all during Destiny 2‚Äôs life
---
Tbh, I don‚Äôt see many mountaintops on pc in crucible. Personally I use it because I like grenade launchers and can hit direct hits reliably, the mobility and aim differences 100% makes a huge impact though. If you can‚Äôt land direct hits it‚Äôs ok at best.
---
Isn't that one of the Jade Rabbits where you present a Rice Cake to them? Or the room where you can view all your collected Rabbits?
---
the nerfs didnt do too much tbh, the only thing that really changed was the healing on kills when the real problem was the duration of the super being as long as approximately 47 days
---
they nerfed the duration by 2% and took away healing from all supers, consequently nerfing an already bad super, arcstrider
---
Nothing surprises me about that damn thing.
---
Even outside momentum it‚Äôs very strong though
---
Someone's mad lol
---
Yes!
---
hackers
---
Thanks man
---
Im on Xbox thats  the thing
---
Oh then yeah definitely
---
You're just very lucky
---
I was about the same when it happened to me. It's been a very nice way to close the gap on my friends given I've only been playing, not even 2 weeks in.

Its a good perk I guess for doing some Halloween grind.

I usually can't get a good piece of legendary gear to drop xD I'm not that lucky. RNG Jesus hates me

I don't record my gameplay. Don't be an ignoramus that thinks it's an unhackable game though. If it's on the internet at any capacity, it can be hacked. Full stop, don't even come at me with that shit. I've had 12 private messages about how this game can be hacked and its bull shit and that didn't happen. Mother fuckers it fucking did what god damn point do I have to lie? Get the fuck over yourselves.

new player here,
