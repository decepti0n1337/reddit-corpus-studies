PvP isn‚Äôt even fun right now, at least to me. It‚Äôs just a roll of the dice on how I‚Äôll get one hit killed, or how many enemies are using telesto etc.
---

---
Didn‚Äôt even bother with banana either, which is an event I usually love.
---
---
---
I‚Äôve still got the 40 strikes to complete for that one, but I will do, eventually..  so many good legendary weapons to choose from, the exotic‚Äôs really need to stand out. 
---
Yeah...I did mention handheld, but forgot shoulder charge. I will say that better gear isn't particularly relevant, because you can do well with blues if need be.
---
Ay same tho. It's all Sweet Business and Anonymous Autumn for me.
---
What are you on about? Nova Bomb is extremely weak as a super and imo Blade Barrage is much stronger and versatile than Chaos Reach as a super. Chaos Reach can be hard to aim and is slower to get out than BB. Plus, you know, Shards is a thing. This coming from a hunter main btw.
---
It will count don‚Äôt worry
---
3 individual deaths.
---
Why does the speed change so much? 
---
I prefer Hammerhead myself. Couldn't get a good feel for Avalanche. 
---
I can't be the only one that doesn't have a problem with one eyed mask users, right? Unless it's mainly a pc thing (I'm on xbox)
---
Exept when i get it.. when i get it the map seems to be devoid of enemies and i dont get shit
---
If they were green they were weapon telemetries. If not I have no idea. 
---
that is good because I will likely fall to 0 Elo shortly after 
---
Just shoulder charge them? 
---
AYE!
---
If you‚Äôre running the arc subclass then I‚Äôd say Crown of Tempest would be better. It gives you more towards your super as well as more energy towards your grenade, melee, and rift. 
---
## the helmet stays on 
---
Datto will help
---
PM me your gamertag and I can help you through one sometime. Do Last wish all the time with my clan, we try to have a couple new people in with us most of the time to help them out.
---
Everyone playing right now has to go through the same matchmaking you do and actually D2 on PC isn't really big enough to have matchmaking ONLY be based on glory. 
---
It takes priority over glory but if there are no players in the same range as you then it will change up how it searches. This is why when you have longer queue times you tend to get LVL 20 players and what not.
---
Besides if you wanna get into it Luna's is a garbage gun so you should have no problem playing against it Not Forgotten while it is the best PvP Primary in the game it's not easy to use so if you are using AoS just pick the correct engagements. Not forgotten only has 47 range while Ace has the highest for any handcannon by a good bit at 78. Ace is far more consistent and easier to use and once you get lunas/not forgotten you're gonna realize this aswell and most likely not use them very often.
---
I have no idea what mobile legends is but CS:GO has a much bigger player base than D2 Comp that's why they can easily match based on ranks.
---
What platform? 
---
So true lmaooo and the audio too, it's so freaking loud for some reason 
---
Petra?
---
He's got eyes for one woman and one woman alone 
---
Crimson valor
---
How can I throw it to someone when there all shooting the shield wondering why its immune. I do it on my own most of the time. 
---
While trying not to sound condescending, basically everything you just said is wrong. If you know how to actually use movement in PVP, Hunter is probably the best class. Blade Barrage is the only super in the game that can both shut down any other super, or clear 4 people in one second. With Shards of Galanor, you can pop your super three times before someone else gets to their second. 
---
ehhh
---
I infuse regularly and I‚Äôve masterworked a bunch of weapons and armor. I just keep getting them, however I did have about 300 going into forsaken 
---
&gt; Crucible isn't just about supers though either.
---
You still have Faction Rally tokens?!? 
---
Someone said this exact same thing earlier and I replied with this:
---
My Titan is an ashen haired Awoken so he can play pretend ;)
---
If you don't get any responses here, you can try /r/destinysherpa. That subreddit is dedicated to finding experienced players who are willing to teach new raiders. 
---
The heat that must give off like damn
---
borealis? that‚Äôs impressive. i bet itd be pretty good for the envoy shields too
---
Wow didn‚Äôt know they existed many thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Left with a sour taste in my mouth.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox so sadly I can‚Äôt help in that aspect but there are numerous guides on YouTube that can teach you how to do it and just as long as you study them and all that you will technically KWTD even if you haven‚Äôt completed the raid yet üëå 
---
Lmao. Titan favoritisms. Get the fuck outta here with that. Usually when titans have something OP it gets nerfed within two weeks (Ursas, D1 Sunbreaker). Meanwhile warlocks and hunters get to run around with their OP shit for a while year. Remember radiance warlocks and firebolt grenades with Viking funeral?  How about blade dancer hunters that could walk through a whole team with no health gone on D1 release?  Now we have nova warp which is killing people through walls and heals on kill along with being stupidly easy to use. (It also one shots titans when they‚Äôre in their code of the missile super). Hunters are running around with spectral and gwensin vest and getting infinite supers. And they‚Äôre blade barraging everyone in the crucible and getting a ton of super energy back with shards (and people used to complain about fists of havoc being a panic super. At least it‚Äôs not ranged). One eyed mask is over powered yes. But don‚Äôt sit there and act like every other class doesn‚Äôt have its own version of bullshit. 
---

This is fuckin beautiful, great job!!

Yes, head is TLW. I think arms are tangled web? Robes are dawning/eververse. Boots are lunafaction. 
---
Aye!

Even if it takes you a bit to learn  a team that is experienced will be able to carry

So they ‚Äòll be gone in a few days

As a solo player, depending on your skill level, it should be easy to reach about 3500 comp score. After that, it's needed 100% to have a group. Too many sweaty 4 stacks that are playing to win and ruin your day.
---
 You can't win solely on your skill alone. Most of the time the randoms on your team will be hot garbage. Imagine playing against 4 of yourself and the 3 on your team = null. It just doesn't add up to a fair fight.
---
Any solo player can easily get Lunas Howl. As long as you play consistently, and try your best. May take 3 weeks, may take 2 months. But that's completely up to how much time you invest.
---
Last Season I spent the first 3000 glory only playing with one friend (Took maybe 4 weeks because we only played a few matches a day). Relaxed and just cruised there with some losses here and there (due to the randoms being pretty poor, or the other team was just better than us). But after that, I got a full group and we fought hard to Legend. It was a pain. All of us 2kd+ (not KaD). If you want to go the extra mile, I strongly urge you to find a group to play with. Not Forgotten is a very prestigious trophy and it feels amazing to use.
---
Tldr; You can easily reach 2100 glory playing solo if you just play consistently. If you feel like going all the way to legend or even mythic, you're going to need a Team.
---
Hey 
---
Just Incase no one has told you yet today... I love you 
---
opening shot doesnt work on shotguns. cheers.
---
I got it from the final encounter in SOTP
---
I will conceed that shards is OP, which I did mention. Blade barrage itself isn't necessarily too strong on its own, as it sacrifices potential kills that spectral might offer, instead providing burst damage which will only be most effective if the enemy team is grouped together. As for movement and abilities, yeah, hunters can get some nice plays via dodges whilst refilling melee or reloading guns. However, compared to a fast-healing well or shield that prevents necessity of reloading at all, it is fairly balanced. Speaking of movement, titan skating is worse, allowing access to sightlines far before anyone else. As for your point that blade barrage is the only super that can one-shot 4 people or cancel supers, I bring nova warp to the table. Talk about AoE damage. Hammer of Sol - ranged AoE with high damage. Highest burst? Yes. Best super cancel? Yes. Highest potential for kills? Not even close.
---
P.S. you can't argue single target burst without mentioning handheld supernova, which can one-shot people as a GRENADE slot item.
---
Thank you for the detailed answer!
---
No, it was only up once and it was the very first week of Forsaken. 
---
This is actually how I pronounce it 
---
Use a primary shotty or sniper with a heavy linear as those count, then only use the fusions because you‚Äôll only get special and heavy.
---
Oof
---
Everyone else gorillas, this mans a orangutan 
---
Lmfaoo that's hilarious 
---
Yes. Sunshot has the sunburn perk that shoots explosive bullets that highlight enemies when hit and causes them to explode on death. Malfeasance shoots five slugs before causing an explosion. Both are mediocre guns imo, sunshot being a gun with explosive rounds and body kill firefly and malfeasance being a normal hand cannon with an explosion that procs on nothing less than majors. (Using it on normal adds kills them in 2 to 4 shots, making it pointless)
---
Well that depends on the player and the build.
---
Thanks!
---
Nightfall Strikes AKA nfs are similar to Vanguard Strikes as they can have modifiers but the modifiers or Nightfalls can be chosen by whomever is the Fireteam Leader with a Challenge Card which can be acquired from Xur. The Fireteam Leader can also handicap the Strike adding points by temporarily weakening the Fireteam. It should also be mentioned that different modifiers increase or decrease the score multiplier. Nightfall‚Äôs also have unique drops which (I‚Äôm uncertain of this part)  have a higher chance of dropping if the player (not the Fireteam) has reached the High Score of 100,000 points. 
---
All Raids are different aside from a few things: 
---
1. They all have unique weapons 
---
*2. They follow specific themes (Cabal Empire, Awoken Space Magic, Fallen Splicers, etc.)*
---
3. They more often than not require a full Fireteam of 6 Guardians to get the job done
---
*4. It ends with a big ol‚Äô boss fight*
---
I hope this was helpful 
---
Did I miss something? When did Telesto become the new meta?
---
Sounds like more fun than the standard fight tbh
---
Very good.
---
lemon key face
---
This is how I think of it now. If you cant beat em, join em.
---
STOOOOOOOP
---
It‚Äôs currently Week 2 of Curse, when it‚Äôs still growing
---
Instant health and overshield means after a single fight unless you gang up on him he will always win, no matter what making skill worthless.
---
Hence why its op.
---
That‚Äôs true. I guess it is more situational than I realized. (I main titan but even though I have this exotic I‚Äôve only used  it once due to fear of getting a swarm of hate mail and trash talk from a 6 stack again).  Good luck against the triggered warlock and hunter mains, though. 
---
Scratch that, all those are even worse
---
Not for long you warlock mains, the new Nerf gon' get ya ;)

Idiotic? You have not played many games with dedicated servers then? Either that or all the games you have played have been peer to peer lmao. It's bungie choice to implement or not to implement a dedicated server system, so yes, I would say it is their fault in reference to someone having an advantage in a competitive game due to their lag. Almost every competitive game i.e overwatch, csgo have dedicated server systems. Also, are you a console player?
---
This would make a killer wallpaper, great work
---
It's not instant overshield, just instant heath. The other option to ganging up is to simply not go into a 1v1 with a guardian with overshield. This should be true for all situations, if u know he's got mute health than u, don't fight it. OEM overshield goes away in 7 seconds. That's pretty short. The whole perk can only proc if the titan gets a kill anyways, so if u can kill him, it won't even proc. It takes skill to use OEM. It also takes skill to kill someone with OEM.
---
How to do maximize gwisin in PvE? I tend to just heavy attack adds grouped together and light attack only when needed, but it doesn't feel like my super lasts as long as you describe 
---
Load up Mars regular strike, go into terminus lost sector, kill 5 adds with one shot, complete lost sector and repeat ad nauseum. You will eventually be locked out of the strike, so if anyone joins they'll either realize what's up and join or they'll just leave because it bugged out 
---
Asking the real questions
---
Mara got battle jitters before she had to go fight Oryx.  So she used the Wish Wall to have Riven wish Shaxx to her for some late night fun to take her mind off of dying.  
---
As far as I know they have not acknowledged it at all, but we will see now that the holidays are over. 
---
I agree with you on most of this, especially the ideas about special ammo.
---
Start by completing shattered throne dungeon.
---
Complete mission in Tangled shore
---
Redo shattered throne dungeon work additional bosses

YouTube wish ender and there'll be a ton of videos explaining in detail

Pvp in Destiny suffers the same thing as Warframe. There is little combat time. Fights don't last long because everyone has a tiny health pool.  Shotgun or not, everyone dies in a few hits, or instantly dies when someone uses their super. Most of the time spent in pvp is either running around or waiting to respawn. It's a twitch shooter with weapons and abilities that cuts down even more combat time. I don't know what can they do to fix this. I'm not saying pvp is perfectly fine. I'm saying this is the nature of the game. Everyone's a superhero in Destiny. It's not like CoD or Battlefield where everyone is a common soldier.
---
The reason why people are bringing up things that seem broken is because those things highlight the fact that we rarely get to taste actual combat in pvp. 
---
Keep up the good work! 
---
THIS IS ACCEPTABLLLLLLLLLLLLLLE!
---
Having your perfectly rolled MG, AR, SR, HC, Bow, PR, or Sword is far from lame. 
---
Meanwhile, I got a 640 hard light.. twice.
---
That just means more time running around and less time actually fighting
---
Ouch
---
The other commenter summed it up nicely, but in case you do not already know, the Shattered Throne is only available every three weeks, on the third week of the curse in the Dreaming City.
---
You can tell which week it is by what the Dreaming City looks like. [Here is an album of screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/U3CvlXm) comparing the first and third weeks. If you don't want to physically travel there, look at where Petra is. 
---
The Strand: First, least cursed week
---
Divalian Mists: Second, middle week
---
Rheasilvia: Third, most cursed week.
---
Very quality comment 
---
Ew no
---
I pronounce it by exclaiming that my enemy will feel the venomous sting of the mighty monarch!
---
Monarchs aren't venomous so I believe this is obviously a Venture Brothers reference.
---
is that good or rare or something?
---
Yoi guys think those boots cayde has on are exotics?
---
Can‚Äôt vault those either unfortunately 
---
No, it makes scout rifles and other weapon classes better, while not nerfing shotguns and melee abilities in the mean time. 
---
I'm 14 so it really doesn't bother me.
---
Yeah, I've mained  Warlock since D1 and never had a big problem, recovery is like 7-8 but my mobility sucks, I can go toe to toe with almost any titan unless their speed gets me, same with Hunters, I squash them fast unless they get in my face real quick. 
---
yes, the highest key value. My posters are only 1 TF2 key, but I can take CS keys as well!
---
Yeah his Guardian is crisp too...
---
Thancc

Hey you have the exotic that makes wish ender good! And it makes  le monarque easier to use!
---
I have it and dont use it i prefer the Synthocepts 
---
Sir you are respected
---
Yeah sadly. I really don't know why Bungie made him do that. He was so calculated and thought out beforehand using cover, traps and clever set ups to dispatch the Scorn. Then they just had him stand right there and pull his ghost out like he wasn't being shot at. It made no sense compared to his tactical before hand.
---
Yeah. Like, even though cayde is more of a gun n' run type of person, even HE isn't dumb enough to pull his ghost out. And even if he was, the ghost could have stayed tucked away. It doesn't always have to come out once the guardian tells it too. They're sentient.
---
Same, it's sleek as hell.
---
SGA right here! Thanks man 
---
It was the $40.00 cutscene. You have to admit that it was a stupid idea, but, even guardians make vital mistakes. (Like Zavala when he didn't accept my Christmas cookies v\~v )
---
Well his Ghost was rather showy herself but him pulling her out just like that didn't make any sense since he was the one earlier making sure she stayed hidden. It was a complete 180 for his character.
---
Oh that was my bad. Or. One or the other. And some guy said there's some buff from Titan that enables hit kills as well, but idk about that one
---
If I had the money, I'd plat this, it's freaken amazing! 
---
They have a obligated contract with activision to make 3 destiny games they have no choice but to
---
And you know, I wish that during the rifleman fight, you weren't allowed to pull your ghost out, or you instantly died and weren't allowed to be revived (as if you died without anyone else having a res token). Obviously, there would be a cue so if you accidentally pull it out, you could redeem yourself.
---
Either way, not special. People get it everyday. What I consider lucky is people getting three random drop exotics in one day.
---
Plat? What do you mean? (I'm literally a child when it comes to Reddit terminology I'm so sorry üòì )
---
Ouch that hurts my man. I knew Zavala was a cold bastard. But damn... the cookies... 
---
As for the $40.00 cutscene, yeah I know but it would have been more badass if he survived *somehow* and showed up at the end of foresaken like 
---
&gt;Yo bitches my gun is dirty af what the heck man. 
---
The crown or auras your talking about only stay active for 2 weeks from whatever activity you completed to get the aura. The different auras that can currently be acquired include the prestige leviathan raid aura(that means leviathan, eow, or spire), the nf aura, and the guided games aura(finishing a guided game raid).
---
??? Feeding frenzy is better either way, no need for a precision kill. 
---
Yep, that solved the problem.  Thanks again.
---
You're gonna give me \*some SFM ideas man\* mmmmm
---
That would have been a really cool mechanic. See I'm a dick [even to NPC's yeah I know..] and right before I killed the rifleman I pulled my Ghost out and then opened my menu to change the shell to Sagiras shell just to make it an even more glorious target for him and he didn't do dip. He was scurred.
---
I'm a noob and I have no clue what SFM means haha but yesss
---
Scurred like a kurrty Curt scurred of dogs. Hell, in the beginning when he says to pull out your ghost and you do, absolutely nothing happens. I'm a rule follower (good listener and pit boss achievements on portal 2), and I like to obey.
---
yup lol telling you right now it takes a lot of practice to get the method down. sometimes you swipe 1 to many times or you heavy attack and completely miss the target and waste a large part of your super haha
---
it is what it is. If you had one eyed mask, you would do the same. 
---
Reddit has 3 reward things, Platinum, Gold and Silver. People give them to comments and post if they really like them, but they cost irl money. A lot of big posts on r/DestinyTheGame get rewarded if they have thorough analysis of something big or really nice art. And it's ok, I've been on Reddit for 2 yrs now and I'm still learning about this site. 
---
(Someone probably will give you an award for the incredible art)
---
Yeah that‚Äôs to be expected the point is it‚Äôs OP
---
Can we make this a "Feature"
---
Well, thank you! I'm flattered üòÅ 
---
You increase your gear score by doing weeklies and anything that says "powerful gear". Reset just started today
---
There are raids in the game, there are also Strike missions which are dungeon-like missions
---
SFM is short for an animation program called Force Filmmaker. It was used to create the "Meet The Team" series from Team fortress 2, and was also used in Half-Life!
---
Gimmmeeee
---
True
---
Cool thank you. Do you have to have a certain gear rating for the dungeon missions? 
---
Back in Y1 we had a lot more activities that gave guaranteed masterworks very often and it was easy to stockpile.  Especially if you were doing prestige raids and Trials. I had upwards of 300 going into Forsaken. 
---
How does it compare in d2
---
here i am, after long five days w/o exotic, i got Prometheus lens, gg, gratz man
---
Its been 2 weeks after my forsaken campaign completion AND AM STILL STUCK ON THIS PART 14/25. 
---
I finally had Chromatic drop too. I wish the explosions were bigger.
---
I managed to get this and Le Monarque today. It was a good day.
---
Yeah I dislike how proportions seem to change depending on the gear you wear. Your shoulders will get smaller or broader and your butt will move up and down depending on the piece. A lot of the stuff also just seems like random shapes more than anything.
---
No
---
Cheers. Anything else. I've been hitting the weeklies for gambit, vanguard, strikes etc but the engrams keep dropping gear around the 530 mark
---
Powerful gear. Got it. Cheers
---
Amazing!!!!!!!
---
I think it looks fine. Besides, *it's my strong head.*
---
Eyes up gardian. 
---
how long have you been playing jesus
---
This is exactly why I dont waste my super before seeing how much time is left
---
We good dw was jist curious :p
---
You can purchase year 1 (vanilla, Curse of Osiris, and Warmind) exotics from Xur, a hidden NPC who appears on a different planet every Friday and disappears the following Tuesday (at noon EST, 9 AM PST, or the corresponding time in your time zone). 
---
Another way to get lots of year 1 exotics is the Leviathan raid. Go with someone who can bring you to the underbelly chests you get keys for throughout the raid. 
---
Other than that, there is really nothing you can do. Challenges, which reset each week, seem slightly more likely to give exotics compared to other activities. You can try using a fireteam medallion, but I have personally not noticed a difference with those. 
---
/r/DestinySherpa 
---
I have a lot of fun with top tree stormcaller, I personally think stormtrance feels better than nova warp even if nova warp is objectively stronger. Plus I get to shout UNLIMITED POWER which is always a plus 
---
We casual gamers play games to have fun, not compete for the Olympics.
---
Me either, I strictly remember it being kinetic :0
---
I'm usually not able to play when Xur is here. Last time I bought something from him was about two months ago. 
---
Gotta use protection.
---
Yep
---
Wtf
---
Got Two Tailed Fox, Heart of Inmost Light, Black Talon and Antaeus Wards within 1 week
---
Then you don't know how to use a hunter correctly.

&amp;#x200B;
---
It's a meme, chill dude
---
Audio is loud because your sound settings aren't tied to a hard drive, they're tied to a profile so until it recognizes the user it's all default to 10s which by God is loud. I know it's not the only game that does it, fortnite used to do it when I played months ago, it may still do it
---
Comgrats on your smg!
---
I got rampage and feeding frenzy, with 44 mag, it is absolutely ridiculous.
---
Celestial nighthawk is trash in pvp. Goldie is always a 1 shot and with nighthawk you have 1 shot instead if 3 or 6.
---
I like this strat. Personally I think special should moved to creates like power. if apes want there ammo they should work for it. me smiling waiting for you with my trust. 
---
Why is there a god damn Napoleon Bonapart lmao xd
---
Become obselete with chaos reach + geomags now but used to love this piece 
---
Yes you did deserve this and soooooo much more
---
Me out running half the supers in the game (minus panic supers/insta cast/support ones) Thanks to them as a hunter,says something
---
Poor dude got catfished so hard..
---
Woah there‚Äôs destiny models on sfm already? Mind giving me a source? I‚Äôd like to try them out sometime
---
I am. But that's not why I miss IB, I just like the game play. I prefer objective based PVP over just DM or TDM.
---
Lockdown is alright, but it's too short and too easy to get behind with no chance of catching up. IB was like the perfect mix of all of those for me at least.
---
Not a silly question at all and I am indeed. 1 or 2 give a decent amount but most of them are worthless, 20 -100 bright dust at a time isn't much good
---
If you got the new exotic bow give it a try. 100% poison arrow.
---
I believe it was kinetic but a glitch made it look solar sometimes. 
---
People these days. Those names aren't even creative...
---
It‚Äôs bad. Firefly will almost never proc because the explosive damage won‚Äôt be precision.
---
Damn. Thanks for the help!
---
I hate it when that happens UGH
---
Sick dude. 
---
I bet 90% of this sub had to google who that was, or what Genesis is. 
---
I think he referred to the thing you said about only posting this in the title and leading with it aka making it the title, anyways FUCKING AWESOME DUDE &lt;3 
---
For someone who took a minor break from D2 to play other games and is now a little behind in light. Is buying the annual pass really worth it if I‚Äôm sub 600 light? Or should I wait till I‚Äôm 600+ to buy it and enjoy it. I know they changed the system so I get to 600 quicker but I‚Äôm still curious. Thanks! 
---
just gotta say.. sleeper shot on a high value red bar - now THAT is big dick energy.
---
Because your statement was laced with an intent that didn't seem like it was about learning. You then follow it up with calling me some shotgun crutch nerd player further proving your own inability to not be hostile and further taking the community down the drain by not being a better person. You have to insult me to try and get a rise out of me.
---
I pointed out your ignorance and then you flame me and determine me part of some problem. 
---
You were downvoted for not adding anything to the thread other than riding someone else's ignorant question by not fact checking. That's how reddit works which is yet again another function of reddit. You didnt contribute anything. 
---
There also used to be a turquoise crown from completing a Flawless card in trials of the nine.
---
It's that one Turquoise &amp; black emblem with the "Knight/horse" chess piece icon.
---
Can't get it anymore, so it's pretty rare. The aura only lasts 2 weeks too, so it's impossible to get the aura even if you have the emblem. Trials of the Nine was removed from the game.
---
Fodder
---
I'm guessing maybe so, I know when I was trying to find a video for something a while back I accidently happened on an annoying brit dude that saved his exotic engrams to open for his videos so his viewers could see "WHAT RNJEEEEEZUSSS HAS BESTOWED UPON US!!!" or whatever.
---
hey man wanna share...
---
It‚Äôs half pulse rifle, and half shoulder charge. Either top tree striker or melting point. 
---
SCUMBAGS
---
There is a way that bakkengansta on youtube has done, and it is by using the celestial nighthawk with the 6 shot GG. He equips it right after he pops his super and each kill regens the duration of GG so if ur looking for duration on 6 shot, thats one way.
---
Could you elaborate? Calling someone bad is not only provocative, but more importantly, unhelpful. If you find hunter melee to be stronger, please explain instead of accusing someone who has responded with full explanations to everyone else.
---
What the fuck just happened?
---
No. No one else has this luck. You‚Äôre just one lucky, lucky, lucky bastard...with as much respect as I can muster at the moment...go to hell my friend...you know who this is. Happy for you and not happy at all
---
I blame DeeJ. Per usual

PC?

You're on the correct path. It is believed on the seventh return of the highest curse week we will get the next piece of the story.

I'm juts making a joke about rarely getting to third phase because my luck with the MM is nonexistent.

rewards should be in achievements and glamour not obvious advantages over other players who do not have the time/patients to deal with the local hosted garbage that is destiny pvp.

It‚Äôs literally the only Forsaken exotic I‚Äôm still missing!
---
You are the enemy of my people.
---
Funny how we‚Äôre all guardians who all live together and unite our forces to fight the darkness yet we begs our creators to nerf one anotherü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
Managed to spawn on mars with like 5 other people grinding EP. We got to the 7th boss and did levels 6 and 7 roughly 10 to 12 times this morning. So many shaders. Which makes me mad because my stupid ass loves puns so I feel like hes throwing shade at me.
---
I am not happy that I did that pun. It's just how my mind works
---
Cheers guardian, I thought JW was Feb - my bad
---
ok
---
Catapult
---
You the mvp my man
---
I literally got it yesterday. Rng is a bitch.  
---
I thought that, but read somewhere that unclaimed primes adjust their level after a season change
---
Well not with gwinsin thats just insanity
---
I like to hit those healing rifts right before a corner to a choke point so allies can bob in and out getting healed each time they go to cover. 
---
I literally got the catalyst yesterday. 
---
Did it drive you to another game?
---
This warms my heart, thank you so much
---
Are those your words or the words of others? One eyed mask isn‚Äôt that much of a game breaker. You‚Äôre telling me, skullfort that gives you infinite‚Äôs shoulder charge is less threatening than an overshield? Git gud. 
---
You know what, don't nerf mask. But if titans get the skating exploit and a damage-buff/wallhacks/full heal plus overshield in one exotic, at least un-nerf wormhusk crown and give warlock some neutral exotic worth a damn.
---
A lot of streamers/pro's use the tactic to get after the worlds first raid... once you hit the level cap, there is little point in handing in a powerful engram unless they are going for a god roll on certain guns. I have never hoarded and I have been on board since year 1 - but I am certainly toying with the idea.
---
Wat? Nova warp ring a bell?
---
Fuck that Helmet. And fuck Titans in general 
---
If the forge would drop one I'd be happy.
---
oh gawd! This is so good that bungie may nerf this!
---
Seriously, I love it :3
---
24 in monitor. But I've got pretty good ambient lighting so my eyes aren't too strained
---
Synthoceps. On the enemy screen you spazz out all over the place during the lunge, making you almost impossible to hit. 
---
LMAOOO 
---
Need this on my Titan 
---
 Where can i find more of your art besides reddit? 
---
Or you know, do both? 
---
The brick was on the floor. I was hoping to die near enough my teammates with a trade to deny the enemy team the ammo. 
---
Alright thanks for the help!
---
Geomags don‚Äôt work with stormtrance though 
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
This. As well as I‚Äôm pretty sure destiny was meant to be a PvE game until the community got bigger and asked for it no? So I‚Äôd imagine PvP isn‚Äôt on the forefront of their fixes. Idk tho, so feel free to correct me
---
More like gave me time to play other games I have been neglecting for destiny
---
You know how we all sometimes you run into really good opponents, that (aside from their good builds and good aim) seem to keep catching people off guard?  
---
Among other things, he's likely waiting to hear both his teammates and the enemies open fire before he approaches, to ensure the enemy is distracted and give himself an extra fraction of a second to get in close. And even when he gets there, the enemy is still distracted worrying about his teammates firing at them.  
---
I'd hazard a guess that when this guy is using his guns *and* melee, he usually tops the scoreboard or thereabouts.
---
When the edibles kick in....
---
This was essentially the situation for all classes for D1 after two years of gun nerfs.
---
I'm using synthos. The overshield is from top tree sentinel. You get health back from melee kills, and an overshield from the melee ability. 
---
This is how I felt at first. When I first started playing destiny after forsaken for the first time since its release. I was so irritated about the core system. But since I've reached max level I've found myself consistently getting cores. I vary between casual and hardcore depending on my schedule. But, what made it easier is just dont pay attention to them. Use the crappy gear that boosts your level and keep at pve. Then grind pvp and strikes because rewards from shaxx and zavala drop cores often for me. I look to dismantle any drop that sucks but has a MW level 4 or higher.

---
You answered your own question so people don‚Äôt keep dropping out cuz the don‚Äôt wanna play against a four stack. 
---
Begins on Friday reset and ends on Monday reset.
---
I just started playing two days ago and jumped on a crucible match and can confirm this is very true. 
---
I fell ya man exact same thing for me 
---
Of course I know what nova warp is. What I'm saying is, there are much less Warlock players in the crucible. Every time you die, you'd see Hunter Gunslingers and Nightstalkers or Titan Sunbreaker and strikers. Sure there are some who play warlocks but rarely you'd ever see one in the crucible. On PC at least.
---
I like the part where he punches the guy.
---
I was surprised I made it all the way through 
---
I want the hight five one, but i can't find it, Tess doesn't want to :&lt;
---
What are we looking at?
---
Use the Mida next time
---
Is that your Instagram tag? I‚Äôve got to give you a follow somewhere. I absolutely adore this. 
---
I had been using Ikelos Shotgun in the Energy slot (special ammo), but have been running into issues with even being in melee range on bosses (e.g., primevil), due to knockbacks.  I can get a few shots in and kill something small, but the bosses are a bit harder.
---
My style has primarily been SMG/AR for clearing out trash, and Scout/LFR for distance depending on element.  In most cases, as you've suggested, I tend to use the LFR for bosses, though if I can get decent head-spam, I like the Polaris Lance for longer fights.  A one-shot is a one-shot, but 2 minutes of fighting one boss does run the heavy ammo pretty low.  That isn't meant to detract from your point, but give some info of why I like it. 
---
I feel like the answer to this is "yes," but one can never be too sure with hidden math by devs... do weapons with primary/special ammo hit similarly, or is special always higher dps?  My only real example would be a shotgun where you can have primary ammo or special ammo shotguns.  DPS wise (ignoring the +%dmg you get from kinetic, or the shield breaking from energy), do they perform similarly?
---
I have been an arc shoulder-charge junkie using ISF for most of my play, but trying to get more acquainted with *group friendly* gameplay, as many of my friends are not into rushing things.  Tie that with my love of being a tank, the Sentinel shield is pretty great, imo.  I like to melee, and am focusing hard on the Resupply perk + Impact mods + momentum transfer, but maybe that's not ideal?
---
I had been using Traction religiously on my legs, but i couldn't tell how much more beneficial that was over something like Dynamo.  Still trying to figure that out, which I feel is related to playstyle. 
---
In rubber-ducking with your post, I feel like I should lean more heavily to Mobility, since my build focuses on melee cooldown reduction, and my melee gives significant healing.  
---
Regarding number of points towards MRC, you have 17, while I have 13.  If I use Traction, that's 14 points, but I have to ask... are you using mods or does your gear offer those points in other ways?
---
The light in my room is kinda dim
---
Or go to the Tower more often? How many hours of gameplay did it take to yield this?
---
It honestly should be, you will always find the occasional toxic player. But based on how properly structured your statements and questions are, as well as how polite you are. I dont think you need to worry. 
---
I always use [this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/a0igko/escalation_protocol_weapon_drop_schedule_updated/) It can be found quickly if you google "escalation protocol calendar", should be first result. 
---
Hope that helps, good luck to ya!
---
What is Y1/Y2 means? 
---
Iron banner at a low power level
---
I can‚Äôt speak for PC but there is a good variety on PS4.  I often get killed by nova warp. Titans aren‚Äôt too hard to shut down, at least on console. 
---
Because we care about shooting stuff and looting, not marveling at NPCs
---
The LMG honestly isn‚Äôt all that bad. One-Eyed is cancer in quick play against level 5s who don‚Äôt know how to fight it but if you play at any level higher than pubstomp it‚Äôs no big deal to fight during anything but a super. 
---
Here‚Äôs why:
---
One-Eyed only rewards a Titan who is able to kill his mark. If you play intelligently and notice you are marked, simply run away and back into a group of your allies. Nine times out of ten you have effectively baited that Titan into getting himself killed. 
---
Nice
---
If you want to be super efficient (and play a LOT), save your weekly powerful engrams until the day before reset until 600+. Prime engrams were changed to drop more frequently and give a bigger boost
---
What is this OP gun? It 2 shots people. How do I get that gun?
---
Maybe they should add a solo que for Gambit only then. I think crucible matchmaking is fine. I don't understand what is so bad about having a solo que. If players want to have longer load times  to get into a solo que let them. If you're going in as a 4 stack you're already expecting a sweaty game anyway let them match against each other. 
---
I was playing Lockdown yesterday, and was always taking the same route to the enemy's point while my team was going to point B, and hammer charging the first guy I encountered. In the same place. Every round. Only during the last round did they anticipate the charge and try to ambush me (which didn't work, but at least they didn't get shoulder charged that time).
---
Glad to hear that! I appreciate you lol
---
You play on PC?
---
Lol you are fine. As long as you know what you are doing and aren‚Äôt annoying, nobody will have a problem with you. 
---
I am over 50 and feel the exact same way. 
---
I was just thinking about this stuff yesterday! I believe you are onto something here.
---
Though, I dont think it was the queen and her brother who said, "Find the Black Garden. Rip out its heart. Only then will your Traveler begin to heal." It was the Exo stranger&gt;!(Elsie Bray)!&lt; on Venus.   
---
Why would killing the black mass start healing the traveler? The black mass might have been suppressing or draining its light.   
---
After reading the drifter lore cards of his time on the icy planet, I believe that the thing(s?) the drifter and his crew came across, have similar attributes. They both suppressed or drained the light of his crew members. Maybe the crews light and their ghosts were suppressed unto death. The drifter describes the creatures as gooey form with no head. The blob in the Black Garden looked pretty gooey. 
---
I really want to know what the drifter has in store for us in jokers wild.  
---
   
---
I'd chalk it up to the map. Most people use long range weapons, so I assume they were scoped in most of the time. Plus I don't think they expected someone to rush in close range. 
---
It was more for fun, to see how low my damage would go from me just healing my team
---
If i where you i would not do that...if bungie detects is u get a ban. Just saying ;)
---
Because instances are so damn tiny probably
---
That might be the worst enemy team I‚Äôve ever seen. 
---
Im glad my name is not on the opposing team. 
---
Did you kill it? Your team has to kill it to get it.
---
The meatball drops an exotic heart that goes directly into your inventory 
---
Yeah the registration on whether or not it actually gives you the perk seems screwy. Sometimes I do it a little early or late, and it works, and a lot of the time I do it right when I should, and it doesn‚Äôt. But it‚Äôs still a lightweight bow (tested against Midnight Coup) with great stats, so if you like bows, it‚Äôs pretty good.
---
#STOP...ENJOYING THINGS...
---
Hello, brother. The time has come for us to team up and retake this solar system for our own ridiculous intentions. Let us fist our way to glory![Winning Rumble Shoulder Charge Only](https://youtu.be/hPEeoxuR2vU) 
---
Am titan. My skills are lacking. Teach me.
---
Which codes? 
---
The ones for the emblems, you can find em on twitter
---
At this point anything that is not powerful will drop below your power level and will not help you get any higher.
---
These powerful rewards along with prime engrams and a couple other powerful drops are how you raise your power from 500 to the current cap of 650. You do all of your weeklies, etc and then have dailies and primes to get some more increases until the weekly reset brings more powerful gear with it. 
---
Along with the obviously marked powerful drops, there are also some others such as raid drops, clan engrams, certain bounties, etc. that drop powerful. 
---
You may find that the powerful drops are a little limited at first, but as you start meeting level requirements for things like the nightfall, Dreaming City, spider‚Äôs top wanted bounty, etc. there will be more than enough to do. I would encourage you to unlock the Dreaming City ASAP and start pushing yourself to do activities that are above your level. As a general rule, activities up to 19 above your power level are very doable without too much trouble. So you‚Äôd want to be at least 521 to start doing a 540 activity for example. 
---
It me
---
Guess I'll try stormtrance again soon. It did fill like I was just tickling bosses lol 
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Lmao this can't be real.
---
I'm a new 50 and don't really understand what any of this means. Can someone explain how to read/understand the infographic?
---
Physics?
---
They may be codes for D1 emblems and shaders. Can you put a link up?
---
Yea I've played and I don't use a shotgun but you obviously do
---

Lion Rampants dont make u faster, do they? Plus u can already titan skate. I would have gone with Hollowfire Heart with sunbreaker titan.

Thank you! „Éæ(‡πë‚ïπ‚ó°‚ïπ)Ôæâ"
---
[Fixed it for you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6it3LBBL60)
---
This reminds me of Doom in the early 90s.
---
If you won that round, it should've gone to your pursuits tab unless it was full. Maybe the postmaster?
---
Also, there has been a glitch where you defeat the primeval first but it credits the other team with the win, not sure if that would've happened in your case.
---
The annual pass forges are all recommended power level 610, with the boss at the end being power level 625. The quests to unlock each forge get progressively more difficult. I do not recommend buying the annual pass unless you are at least 605 or so. I rely solely on random matchmaking for the forges, and I did not reliably start completing them until I was power level 615, since you seem to be most often matched with players within 10 power levels of yourself. 
---
Get after em! Ive been grinding for those primes as much as possie. Went from 500 to 584 in a matter of days. E.P. and Blind well are s good way to get them to drop as well. 
---
Almost ready for Ada-1
---
Yeah, those are D1 codes. Look at the date.its from 2015
---
Oh my god... thanks bro
---
We land at active combat zones, and the part of the tower is probably a guardian only zone, we probably always miss the field trips of school children that visit Zavala.
---
Also the worshipers are in the lighthouse but they kind of just sit there being the same two worshipper models.
---
Np
---
Thats my bae right there
---
&gt;A teammate challenged me to only melee an entire game as Titan
---
So, a regular game then?
---
You will get back almost exactly 80% of your shards if you spend enough, and you will get 1 Enhancement core for about 6 Legendary Shards that you lost. I tried this with 500 Shards multiple times.  I also got an Exotic for each 3000 or so Simulation seeds (Only year one exotics and duplicates). 
---
Note: prime and powerful are different but acomplish the same. Getting that power up
---
just bind jump to mouswheel man
---
How many kills did you get?
---
Well earned ‚ÄúNever Say Die‚Äù medal. Great job man!
---
üëç 
---
Marvelous! 
---
&gt; Synthoceps. On the enemy screen you spazz out all over the place during the lunge, making you almost impossible to hit. 
---
Ah another equip that encourages bullshit cqc play. 
---
Do you have the gun in game?
---
Sorry for the t-bag you have to watch on repeat
---
If it‚Äôs anything like the military, yuh 
---
Each section is divided up by the gray lines. The top left section, starting with "Flashpoint: Io," is a list of powerful gear challenges. 
---
The top right two sections are the powerful gear bounty that Spider sells and below that are a powerful gear quest step and bounty that Petra sells. These are different each week, which is why they appear on there.
---
Each week there are three nightfalls to choose from. You can pick which one on the nightfall launch screen if you click the button with the name of a nightfall right above the green "Launch" button.
---
Recipe for Success is a Black Armory thing. If you do not have the annual pass, this is not relevant to you. 
---
The EP Boss &amp; Drops section refers to Escalation Protocol, an activity on Mars. You can find an in-depth guide to it on the other subreddit, /r/destinythegame, called something like "Escalation Protocol: All Info in One Place."
---
Below that are two raid challenges that give powerful gear, that Hawthorne sells. These involve doing one of the encounters in Last Wish and Scourge of the Past (the latter is in the annual pass) in a particular way that is different from how people normally do them. 
---
Bagging cause I survived a solo ult. I‚Äôm still pretty trash at the game though
---
&gt;What is Guardian of All?
---
I am not sure why Guardian of All is listed separately from the other challenges, since that is referring to all the weekly challenges that appear on the director (it says weekly 20, and there are 20). 
---
&gt;What is Heroic Playlist?
---
Heroic playlist means the heroic story missions and the strikes available under the vanguard icon. It says "3x story missions" and "3x strikes" underneath because you have to do three of each for the challenges. It says solar singe because each week a different element does more damage (both to players and enemies), and this week it is solar. You can tell what the modifiers like this are in-game by hovering over the 3 circular icons in the lower left side of the screen right above the "story mission" or "strike" title of the activity when you are about to launch it. 
---
&gt;And how does one earn Clan XP?
---
You earn clan xp by doing bounties from Hawthorne. If you aren't in a clan, you can't do this. You can earn 5,000 xp per week per character for your clan. 
---
Lockdown is not a strike, that two headed bird image-thing is the crucible icon, so it is saying this is a game mode available this week in the crucible. 
---
&gt;What do the Not So Daily Resets mean and do they give powerful gear too?
---
"Not so daily" things are daily challenges, and you are supposed to get one new one each day, but if you waited the whole week and then did them all in one day they become out of synch for the next weeks. As in, you will not actually get a new one each day, you will have nothing and then suddenly they will all reset. They also give powerful gear. 
---
&gt;For the Nightfalls
---
I think the challenges are in the Triumphs section of your character menu, not actually listed in the nightfall screen. I don't think they have an impact on loot drops, they seem to me to just be achievements.
---
The nightfall exclusive items are rare random drops, but the chances of getting them increases when you have a higher score. It took me 30 or so runs of Strange Terrain to get the exclusive rocket launcher from there, but my team's score was always really low because we just wanted to get it done. I got Warden's Law in less than 10 runs of Warden of Nothing when my team was getting 100k+ scores each time.
---
You increase your nightfall score using a challenge card. The card is in your consumables inventory, but doesn't actually get consumed. Only the fireteam leader needs one, and generally you want a score modifier above 2 but below 2.8, in my experience. You can buy a challenge card from Xur.
---
The small icons above the reward are the different emblems you can get from getting high scores. 
---
&gt;As for the annual pass, when is the next year pass coming out? I don't have the current annual pass that gives Black Armory and Scourge of the Past. Can I buy it after the new one comes out?
---
So far, absolutely nothing becomes unavailable if you purchase it later. There is no reason to suspect that will change, meaning you will always be able to buy this current annual pass. As far as I know, no information has been released about what is coming after this current annual pass. [This is all we know about the upcoming year](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47478). 
---
Usually you will find. Nice people but occasionaly you find that one tough guy who hates kids for some odd reason (think they usually beat him)
---
This is the wrong approach entirely. To each their own. 
---
Ah, I see you're playing against my blueberries. 
---
If you ever get a mysterious item drop, it's probably a quest item. Look in your pursuits inventory for a quest asking you to collect that thing. 
---
Helps your accuracy on console by gravitating towards the head of enemies (Right?)
---
Entirely this, this map is horrendous with how badly people tunnel vision.
---
You know another chicken? That things gotta have Light anyways, seems nearly immortal.
---
Bungie did learn to balance. It was vanilla D2 and everyone hated it.

Take your ass and stuff your mouth with it, because the shit you're spewing is less prolific than anything your rear could come up with.
---
You are probably getting aped really badly by shotgun sliding pussies. Use a telesto for a few minutes, I can usually make apes swap to real weapons and enjoy the remainder of the map. if not, just Telesto bullshit them until they question their life choices. 
---
Not gonna lie, I would be mad getting two year one exotics
---
9/10 times im on that team OP is facing.
---
Is this real?
---
Its not in pursuits or consumables. Thats why im asking. But I recorded video of me picking it up randomly.
---
Ah, it's real nice to see the bane of my sanity in high def. Thank you!
---
If you really really care about the next time raid drops which is in May you don‚Äôt really need to, I‚Äôm saving all my last wish keys for then because I‚Äôve got no reason to use them, plus iron banner bounties, plus raid challenge bounties, you have a lot of time to prepare for penumbra

These types of items do not always go to your invetory.  In this case it marked that part of your Izanami Forge Ignitor quest complete.
---
Very nice
---
Bungie should just get rid of auto pickup for engrams or add a filter for auto pickup. Like leave anything thats not a legendary or exotic on the ground and not sent to postmaster. Would save me so much trouble lol
---
You can join a game where its not against a 6 stack? You are implying that it's possible.
---
All of the Osiris weapons look and feel amazing
---
I gotta get me one of those, it looks just like a current era revolver
---
Crucible isn't hard though, deciding whether or not you want to embrace the Handcannon/Shotgun ~~cancer~~ 'meta' or try to complete quests with other weapons is the hard part.
---
Yeah I tried it because of the bounties as well and there were times where I'd get the jump on someone only for them to turn around and drop me because they had better gear than I did. I can't even imagine what you had to go through.
---
That would be goddamn hilarious if I was on the other team. 
---
It‚Äôs the exotic helmet known as the one eyed mask. 
---
I'm starting to think this will be it for destiny. Activision and all. 
---
One eyed mask.
---
Just because you see more hunters and warlocks in pvp doesn‚Äôt mean their better than titans, it means they‚Äôre more fun to play as, where as titans may be OP but they are boring to play in pvp.

You bet my ass I will fight your cancer with my cancer

I'll use martydom instead.

Got it just this morning, thanks for the encouragement!!

I would love to see your stats, you must be a god with 100 kd since it seems you never lose. But let's just end this 
---
Yes
---
I would strongly advise joining a clan to any noob that is starting to play.  You can post in your clan chat on the Destiny companion app to get to know folks.  You can make new friends.  If it is an active clan, you will find people online that will help you when needed.   You get extra weekly engrams that will help you level up faster from the clan also.
---
How do you reach so far jesus
---
Thank you! 
---
I understand why people enjoy the PvP, but for me nothing would change if it disappeared.
---
I miss hunters actually being fast....
---
Same! Pew pew
---
Has amazing damage to a boss when you constantly hit the crit spots.
---
True statement though
---
The game was like ‚ÄúFuck it bro, have fun‚Äù lol
---
I know that pain. Vex are such assholes to me sometimes.
---
To be fair, when your Guardian doesn't have a babysitter, they cause entire cities to be cursed, do the every bidding of a gaslighting smurf queen, let a crazy Cabal emperor launch them into his planet-grinding furnace, and have to suffer through Curse of Osiris. 
---
I say it's a very good thing they finally have someone reeling them in. 
---
The first one is powerful. After that you spend modulus reports to farm the regular version.

Why has this happen to me

Its been mentioned tons.

Here's what happened.
---
1. You carried over a frame from last week (or a bounty or ballistics log or something). They have stated on multiple occasions that they are looking into issues with carrying these types of items across weeks. They recommended not doing so until resolved.
---
2. You completed that frame. You then completed 1 from this week. The game sees that you have completed your 2 frames for the week now. So you are locked to only doing those 2 frames. Issue is the one you carried over is not available this week.
---
Thats how you got to where you are. Lesson is: don't carry any Black Armory stuff over when the week resets and start every week fresh.
---
Maybe you should consider joining a Clan. One that's active but doesn't look for all the people playing with each other all the time. If the clan is active enough You get the banner perks and Hawthorne powerful gear for free. On my experience is easier to get a fireteam when you want to do something specific. I've got teammates that doesn't do Anything besides existing, some I played once or two when they were looking for a Nightfall fireteam. I think most Young fireteams will be happy to welcome you as long as you give xp to the clan (which I would assume you'll do anyway because it gives you a powerful reward).
---
Okay thanks!
---
Gives ya somethin to look forward to i guess haha. Play crucible. Levels you up super fast, even if you lose
---
Thank you, came here to comment this 
---
D.A.R.C.I has the highest dps of any weapon currently in the game, leaving out cluster rockets. It just doesn't have anything special, like white nail or the splash of 1k voices
---
Oh ok. Lol good luck then.
---
Shmexy. Is that all BA gear?
---
IKELOS doesn‚Äôt need to be random roll as that all have 2 perks already, they just need to be given the Y2 masterwork and mod slots.
---
I think wisper or thunder lord wins the category of highest dps
---
If it were possible, on one sleeve I'd have Shards &amp; on my other sleeve I would have Sealed Ahamkara Grasps. I would literally never have to reload and would get my super hella quick.
---
No. Youre supposed to have access to all 3 weapon frames
---
Nope. Darci outdamages whisper, and whisper outdamages thunderlord
---
Yep following the weeks it is SG or all 3... I've got the sniper and SMG which clearly aren't used much. ü§£
---
I have hundreds of shaders and dismantled all the snipers/smgs
---
Thank you!ÔººÔºº\\Ÿ©( 'œâ' )Ÿà //ÔºèÔºè
---
ThanksÔºÅ
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure as soon as you have the weapon you can then get the drop. But catalysts are usually very rare too so sometimes it can be a problem to get them to drop. Others you have to do certain challenges or missions to get. So that‚Äôs why this was so lucky because as soon as I got the weapon I got the catalyst too (also right after what my friend said)
---
When I recently did it, you had to wait while the elevator was going down, and it would be sitting on top of one of the glass things (second or third, I think) so you had to shoot it before it went above you
---
Bring me too
---
Roger that, thanks man
---
Only in Iron Banner.
---
Can hunters get 1-shot melees too, please?
---
Welp. The Threat Level shotgun can roll with trench barrel so...
---
Charging is for killing supers. A quick blast kills everyone else.
---
I am on the last step (reach fabled) at 1k glory...I am slightly upset about my situation.
---
I‚Äôve literally never seen such shameful complaining and over exaggeration over any part of a game as you people bitch about the crucible. Ya‚Äôll act like it‚Äôs the hardest thing in the world and every game is 100% stacked against you. Get over yourself and learn to fight something that doesn‚Äôt have predetermined spawns and responses to your actions. 
---
I totally get what you're saying. We don't all have time to max out 3 characters. 
---
But my logic is that there is no reason to delete any character. In fact deleting them would destroy all the time you had invested in them. 
---
Perhaps I'm just taking your turn of phrase too literally 
---
Watch out for an RKO out of nowhere
---
Ah yes. The Win More helmet. You know how you counter it?
---
_Walk away_ or win the intial engagement! Or just kill the Titan dead with a shotty. Or play with a buddy and back away while he presses the engagement. This shit isn't hard but I guess shotgun aping is about as much thought as people want to put into pvp.
---
Very nice!!!
---
I always enter crucible threads like "Guys it's not that hard idk what you mean" but this gif made me think that maybe I'm Sting
---
I've had people in my clan tell me she looked like Hilary Clinton and/or Martha Stewart..  I lol'd.
---
IF I HAD 10 TITANS LIKE YOU
---
Np :)
---
I use The Chaperone so you know there's some skill still even if I'm using a shotgun
---
Haha yeah, it‚Äôs all good. I wouldnt delete so many years of investment :) 
---
You only play Rumble? That's half your problem. Shotguns are WAAAAY more rampant in Rumble
---
I miss Breakthrough :(
---
Or exos or awoken come on guardian lmao
---
*suffer through curse of osiris*
---
Shudders as I remember playing that on 3 characters. 
---
45 motes lost lul
---
I didn't know mk 44's recharged melee energy - any idea how much?
---
I only go into any form of Crucible because of the shiny carrots so I don't really care so much about my .60 or whatever KD or even how it came to be.
---
All I want to know is *why can't I mute Shaxx*? I mean I know we're all supposed to have mancrushes on him or whatever but seriously, the only thing that could possibly make getting teasmhot-spawnkilled and group teabagged by sweaty stacks in PVP any less fun is his helpful commentary.
---
Seriously man just let me suffer in peace. And stop ranking me up, it's insulting to both of us.
---
Clearly, everything is fine.
---
Titan, code of the missile mostly 
---
Must be nice to play against people with no thumbs 
---
Titans would revolt. You're essentially taking a D1 exotic (Twilight Garrison) and giving it to Warlocks.
---
8 hours a day is enough to get plenty of shards.
---
Buy 2 cores a day.
---
Dismantling unwanted legandaries will give you scrapper bounties that reward them.
---
Stop complaining. 
---
I don't play warlock a whole lot, mainly just Hunter. What is the Nova Warp issue you are talking about?
---
First I was like "oh what the fuck celastial hawk and spine? OMG bois they finally allow double exos , lets craft some serious builds" and then " ah yea forgot you can just inspect an item without wearing it" #feelsbadman  
---
*Me* left the game
---
Nothing is worse than salty titans
---
Because I'm a brainlet 
---
Wouldnt a headshot kill though?
---
I got it a few weeks ago. Tried it for like 5min and it's been rotting in my vault ever since
---
Who would you report it to lol? Bungie? What can they do about it?
---
Should have used wormgod‚Äôs.
---
Have a look at the drifters inventory.
---
Try obtaining it on a different character. 
---
Were they even aware the match started?
---
 Nice. Got mine on the first run I did Friday or Saturday. 
---
i love gambit but i always get throwers on my team. can never get a 4 stack
---
by malpractice do you mean the malfeasance? i‚Äôve been grinding for that boss for forever. probably 50 games before i grabbed the bounty for the breakneck
---
I know you didn't ask for a detailed explain things of where each catalyst comes from, but maybe you or someone else might find this useful (formatting sucks due to mobile, sorry):
---
**PVE** (Literally just killing stuff anywhere)
---
*Crimson, DARCI, Borealis, Tractor Cannon, Worldline zero* (must be sword kills), *Sturm* (Only drops on Nessus)
---
**PVP**
---
*Jade Rabbit, MIDA Multi-tool, Vigilance Wing, The Colony*
---
**Vanguard/Nightfall Strikes**
---
*Coldheart, Prometheus Lense, Merciless, Riskrunner, Wardcliff Coil*
---
**Raids**
---
*Skyburner's Oath* (Leviathan), *Legend of Acrius* (Prestige Leviathan), *Telesto* (Prestige Eater of Worlds), *Sleeper Simulant* (Prestige Spire of Stars)
---
**Other**
---
*Fighting Lion* (Festival of the Lost), *Graviton Lance* (Faction Rally), *Sunshot* (Faction Rally), *Sweet Business* (Faction Rally), *Huckleberry* (Heroic Adventures), *Polaris Lance* (Quest), *Whisper of the Worm* (Quest)
---
The PVE ones are pretty common. The strike and crucible ones are pretty damn rare. Some are amazing, others kind of suck. Good luck on your catalyst hunting!
---
It stays there, you don't have to do it 100 times
---
*cameras snap furiously*
---
I don‚Äôt see the problem here
---
It be like that sometimes. 
---
There‚Äôs no crit damage on top tree
---
I have 1 upped your meeting, bite me [&lt;3](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/abyn4g/meeting_is_in_order/)
---
No if you use a controller on pc the police will come and arrest you for being a scrub
---
Sure, but that would help in a long term.
---
You can vault certain "unvaultable" items through DIM
---
Looks like a classroom.
---
Every clan i was invited to join, had a disclaimer that you need to join their Discord channel etc. I think i just need to find a casual one.
---
Thanks for your advice!
---
hey look its me
---
Yes the malefaction, just incase you may not know, grinding the boss on full curseweek is better timespent than hoping for it to come on any other week
---
This was my primary kinetic weapon for the longest time. I love it. It felt like a low powered sniper.
---
/r/GlobalOffensive is that way.
---
Love that model! Where did you get that model from, it looks so much better than the Destiny models I find
---
Is that normal melee range for a Titan!? Can hunters punch that far!?
---
Bullshit
---
I am still living that struggle man. Cant wait to be you
---
I cut out all the parts where they killed me. Getting that clip under a minute was super tight 
---
Surrender to the Vex. Resistance is futile. 
---
Top tree sentinel with synthos. You heal with every melee kill, a melee kill with a full melee ability gives overshield, overshield gives a melee damage buff, and being surrounded with synthos gives a melee damage buff. It's riddiculously fun and stupid. 
---
I just want to get the Harbinger's Echo sparrow, not sure if it is only obtainable from destroying the eggs. 
---
Seraph Rounds isn't really good enough to be useful. And the Hand Cannon still reloads way too slow even with Enhanced Loader.
---
Not only that but the Sniper Rifle is entirely useless. Triple Tap requires quick successive precision hits. Box Breathing requires waiting for about 4 seconds between every shot. So you can never have both perks up at once. A Box Breathing Twilight Oath beats it out by having better reload and a better second roll, and 90 or 72 RPM snipers are better in general.
---
Seems like they're basically just unlockables for the Collections and (besides the Shotgun) only semi useful in the time between Warmind and Forsaken for new playthroughs. Meanwhile the Shotgun is still the best Energy shotgun in the game and it leaves me wondering why the rest are still irrelevant. 
---
I'm still waiting on combo shells for most of the planets. I've got like, 3? that work for DC. Way too fucking many Crucible shells.
---
Nessus? Titan? Io? Fuck all that. Find your resources like a schmuck. 
---
Are you sure it disappeared?  The name of the quest and the way the quest looks is different for each step of the quest.  If you talked to the drifter after you received the seething heart quest you should have one now that is requiring you to kill taken bosses.  The third step is to do a special corrupted strike (level 580).  The next step is bank motes and the final step is guardian kills.  Look for a quest line in your pursuits that requires one of those steps.
---
It's a webm
---
Thanks! Yep I have an [Etsy Shop](https://etsy.me/2IY01yS) 
---
Dunemarchers. You can get to the enemy faster to punch them all.
---
r/raidsecrets probably knows
---
Haha sniping bros
