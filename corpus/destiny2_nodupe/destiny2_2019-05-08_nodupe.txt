No problem bro.
---

---
Get that fucking pulse rifle :D
---
---
---
Unsure if you’ve figured it out, but for future people I’m 99% sure you need to have done the Titan quest to get the Rat King quest, and it has to be done on the character you use. My friend and I couldn’t open the door, we completed the quest in like 30 minutes, door unlocked.
---
I done it with a friend, I know I done it right because he got the transponder while standing next to me, but I didn't.  
---
So I done it on my other 2 solo to double check they weren't the one I done the Rat king on. Then again I done it on all 3 solo to double check everything, I cannot unlock the door on any of my toons, and I have rat king done.
---
No reason for these downvotes, you’re exactly correct
---
&gt;all d2 players
---
Sure, as long as you can kill the 690 boss at the end, lol.
---
Guys please help, someone yeeted my wifi and I can't do this today. Will the heroic adventure pop up again this week?
---
I thought destiny had rough releases..
---
Ok? You forgot the shitpost flair
---
Damn. I don't know what to do. 
---
Try tweeting Bungie help or posting in r/raidsecrets or in the megathread for r/destinythegame. You may encounter people with a similar plight and might see how to fix your issue.
---
I hope it gets fixed tho. The pulse rifle looks really awesome
---
Anthem’s beta was sooooo bad I actually cancelled my order (even downloaded it on xbox and pc so see if one was better, both jars as bad.)
---
Waiting for it to go free to play.
---
You need to save the fallen captain in order to get the door open
---
Ok so i just did the enemy is my enemy quest chain and let the mithrax dude go before i got the reactor in the third quest. My door was locked before went back and was able to get in and get the transponder.
---
Thanks, I was looking forward for something to do in Destiny this week also. 
---
Thank you for trying to help, I'll just jump back on Path of Exile till next Tuesday! :)
---
Have fun bro! Look forward to seeing you next week
---
Preach
---
that's what i just did. I've had the eome mission up for a while.
---
Yes I don’t have to complete my quest on d1 to use this beauty!
---
You have to have it done on the same character. Mission progress is by character, so if you got Rat King on another character, you still need to do Enemy of my Enemy for this character.
---
Can confirm. My friend and I couldn’t unlock it, we did the questline (and only did the questline), and could open it.
---
Thank you kind stranger!
---
Gotta either wait for the flashpoint or do it on a fresh character as triumphs are account based. Good news? It's not keeping you from something more substantial like the wayfarer seal itself. But I understand your frustration (as someone who farmed for all the variks lore)
---
Flashpoint is on Titan mate.
---
Help cope with my inevitable failure on the Luna’s grind*

alright i’ll definitely be hitting it soon then! thanks!
---
It’s not opening for me and I have Rat King and everything I tried all 3 characters and door is still locked
---
awesome, love to hear it. thank you for the info
---
Rise up
---
now I can't wait to get back home
---
New exotic quest
---
Duty Bound only has the one roll.  Its a year one weapon.
---
i’ve had this saved for awhile and i made a mistake posting it today, didn’t I?
---
Had to stop because I have to study for finals  :(
---
I’ll get it tomorrow!!!
---
Yeah, just complete the heroic version of the mission for it to drop. It’ll take 5 weeks in total to complete it similar to how the whisper catalyst took 3 weeks.
---
Cool thanks
---
Seconded
---
This is low fortnite, even for you
---
I love this gun.  I prefer the top sight, very clean and doesn't obscure at all.  Put a Rampage spec mod on it when you get one and it is easily as good as Breakneck.  Clears ads through Dragonfly instead of Onslaught.
---
Merchant? Is that you?
---
It’s not there is an enemy in a mission that you have to save instead of kill watch houndish’s video about it
---
I like your edit, yet your still here.... 
---
Lol just kidding bud. At least you can take a joke.
---
Chattering Bone Bois
---
Do the abandoned quest from Sloane.  DO NOT KILL THE FINAL KNIGHT
---
Bungie are just proving they can do it...to rub the next three hand cannon exotics in our face
---
I'm 683 and I felt the same way, I would grind anything that says powerful gear
---
Day 1 Club rise up!
---
So will the quest disappear when the heroic thing changes or can you get it anytime?
---
OMG THANK YOU!!! I swear for the longest time i couldn’t use it but i guess you always could ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Xbox:(
---
Yep we can get the Outbreak catalyst now, Grav Lance we have to wait till next season
---
Where's my Khvostov?
---
It was fun while it lasted.
---
So basically catalyst makes it into D1 version. Okaaaaaaay gotchaaaa
---
General Kenobi!?
---
🦀I loved revelry comp fight me🦀
---
I can't believe you paid full price for a game that was offered for $12 a month.
---
I blew through the quest didn’t realize you had to go to the door. I re did the quest and I kill the shrieker and the door still reads as locked. Did I break the quest?
---
You don’t have to do the adventure at all, just go into the area not in any activity
---
We all know Borderlands is the killer, the og and it's coming back
---
Thanks for the update.  .   But we already know the entire questline.  It's on this reddit.  . .
---
You have to have the Enemy of my Enemy quest done on that character to open it
---
Hate to burst your little happy bubble, but all have been found and the guns been unlocked. Thanks for your helpful contribution though
---
Lookin' like the titan version of outbreak perfected. I love it.
---
Oh shit that looks sick
---
Oh okay thanks 😂
---
Thanks guys, I'm a dummy 😂
---
if anyone does not know whats going on here is the basis its another secret quest chain with outbreak prime at the end this time
---
Step 1:
---
- Do the Heroic mission on Titan. After the first Shrieker there's a door to the left which says 'Unlocked' open that door, and on one of the tables there's the transponder
---
Step 2:
---
- In the fallen transponder there are fallen Banners, go to the EDZ and do the Lost sectors to enable the Nodes:
---
- (ON EARTH) The one in the Church (The Atruim) https://youtu.be/HuC6zWGZUP4
---
- (ON EARTH) The one of the Master Yves quest (The Drain) https://youtu.be/c7tyVRJwYAk
---
- (ON EARTH) Whispered Falls https://youtu.be/SsyocPE5CnM
---
- (ON EARTH) The left lost sector in trostland (Widows Walk) https://youtu.be/okgDgw7AINM
---
- (ON NESSUS) In the lost sector the Rift, all the way in the back in a crate https://youtu.be/yxRSe7Bv2kQ
---
- (ON NESSUS) In the lost sector in the Glade of Echoes (The carrion Pit) https://youtu.be/Kn-TieZR72s
---
Step 3:
---
- Go to the Farm go to the right into a basement, in the back is Mithrax talk to him
---
Step 4:
---
- MISSION TIME
---

Drifter Dialogue after the mission: https://youtu.be/_1ujd4k2fF0
---
Nearly shat my pants when the wall first Killer me
---
Houndish is saying that it is from doing Enemy of my Enemy WITHOUT killing Mithrax. Makes sense since he shows up in the final mission for the weapon.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxo5AraQR-c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxo5AraQR-c)
---
My Flashpoint is showing up as Titan, but I need one last EDZ heroic adventure in order to get Wayfarer. Does anyone know if just completing the Titan things (and getting the Outbreak Perfected quest) will switch the Flashpoint over to the EDZ? or will I have to wait another few weeks?

Only borderlands has a chance imo
---
feeling the literal exact same thing here m8
---
I accidentally killed someone with that while leveling my hunter, I wonder how they felt
---
Nah you had it right ont he other comment, didnt see it cause i forgot reddit doesent auto-refresh
---
Spam, eggs, bacon, and spam.
---
This is not an lfg.
---
On the contrary, I’ve gotten much more enjoyment from watching people play Minecraft than actually playing it myself
---
Going off what you said I assume you can do it on multiple characters for faster progression?
---
You can make an LFG post on the companion app and have a group to do it in 5 minutes. Go to youtube. Get the gun...
---
Could that dialogue be different depending on if you sided with the drifter or not?
---
Are you in the heroic adventure on Titan?
---
Try doing it with a different character
---
I would assume that isn't the case, and that catalyst progress is limited by the account and not by character. But I haven't tested it, so I can't say for sure. Will probably try that sometime tomorrow just to see
---
Go to the quest chances and choices and you have to save mithrax the captain not the night and that will allow you to progress
---
Everyone's getting exotics like crazy, especially if you go multiple characters. I got three in two days the first 2 days of revelry...
---
That's what my engram bar always looks like with only 1 less so that i can still pick up legendary and blue engrams.
---
Went to do the warden of nothing strike to complete my invitation. Had two guys who just kept shooting me in the face with it the entire time. "Look at my new thing bro. Look it." Lol
---
Have tried doing it on all three characters, No luck!
---
My door was open but I’ve only the public events for Rat King
---
I couldn't do it last night with my buddy. We managed to get to the boss on our fourth try or so, but it was pretty late, so we quit for the day. Need to wait till tonight again.
---
Breaking their shield?
---
we found this on accident, lol
---
Took me about 40 minutes
---
Watched Gladd hammer the heroic last night, dear god it’s crazy
---
now go to the forums and cry like the little bitch you are
---
I don't think this has anything to do with casuals vs hardcore players. Timed challenges are fun, they have something to do with mastery of a challenge, and I'm all about that. If I had to chose between 20 minutes and then reset, or doing the Wishender quest, clearly underleveled with only 1 friend and hiding behind the rocks for 50 minutes to kill the 3 bosses in the tangled shore section of the quest, then I'd pick the speedrun.
---
Not cool dude
---
Do you need the annual pass to do the quest? Or does the power level scale down for those that can’t reach 700?
---
And an Orpheus rig
---
Lunas howl here i come. Btw fuck all of you who used skip grenades in revelry
---
Just completed heroic :)
---
The only nightfall I ever solo’d. Back before they put a shrieker in the little room leading into the final area.
---
Check your postmaster and your collections might of  ot had space?
---
There waa no other tweet
---
Yup, oof...
---
Yeah i was keeping my eye on the player count
---
When I got it everyone kept slapping me when I tried to grind the kills for the catalyst.
---
I was mad this wasn't available on Amazon.ca and all my friends were getting onto it. Amazon takes back anything within a short time for full refund, but nooooooo
---
For real? that's really cool!
---
Maybe if he was a hunter he could out run that real life guardian.
---
He ain't no hunter...he got caught lol
---
Username almost checks out.
---
Yea if you run 4s it matches you more frequently to 4s. It sucks lol
---
Was about to comment this
---
Such a good scout rifle, I loved it back when everyone was obsessed with the nameless midnight in year 1. Sadly I use a bow now,  but good times
---
Oh i see what you mean. Stick to solo or just a couple of you then?
---
My games were decent with 2, got a 9 streak with 3 and then lost 3 back to back with 4.
---
But if you have a team team that you play with frequently 4s can be a good way to play.
---
Its locked behind enemy of my enemy story world quest from Sloane
---
I relish the competition
---
The other way around
---
Saguira: Yeaaah Big O decided to simulate the Vault of glass and its real now. He really screwed the pooch on this one can you go and kill a vex god for us?
---
Big O: I did not screw anything! I found a way that didn’t work. Let’s just see this as a learning experience.
---
Saguira: Also the Black Garden is back thanks to us finding another method that didn’t work as intended.
---
Osiris: Sighs*
---
Howdy fellas it's not rat king it's the secret triumph for saving the fallen captain during that "making choices" quest step on that titan quest where you kill a fallen captain or hive knight
---
Hey if you're on PC we can try it together
---
Woah there buddy that mission is tough I would say all three players need to be on their game
---
9 kill super as well, nice
---
DING
---
Rest In Peace good guardian

Anthem is lower due for the loot issues, everyone is pissed at boiware, its still a good game

Is Mithrax the one that we got to choose whether or not to kill him on that Titan mission?

That's right

His name is TRV-3R. Maybe if y’all called him by his real name he wouldn’t be so eager to murder you. Lol

If you’re on PS4 I’m happy to help you buddy. I think it’s accessible from the director now so now, otherwise we’ll have to wait on the blight public event to pop up, it’s definitely a fun mission!

You don't have any missions on your map? The quest might be on the second page of Sloane's inventory.
---
I haven’t done it yet but from the guides I have seen the Arbalest was a good option. Did you use it and if so how did it work out?
---
Oh and congrats man!!!
---
Congrats bud! Who cares if it isn't flashy, it's your first.
---
Titans don’t deserve any love
---
With that name I understand.
---
Bungee named it TR3-VR
---
Terrifying

I feel like there’s an excessive amount of snipers at the very end but yeah, seeing the old Tower is nice.

Speaking of which, I'm not even sure if he doesn't have lateshift today.

In most games, ornaments and the like are *completely* locked behind premium currency, so I still consider us lucky tbh

Good luck tho

#THIS GUN IS COO-COO FOR COCOA PUFFS
---
Murderwall.
---
Thanks for the clickbait, once I noticed there was no raid I didn't stick around
---
Was this the woods puzzle in the first Zelda?
---
thank you for this post. lol had a special case about this yesterday. versed a shitter in a 1v1 cuz he was shit talking nonstop. told him to take off his bought forgotten and run 140/150s (on console so it shows skill). beat him and then he says “if i had my nf i wouldve beat u” lol imagine being that much of a crutch😂😂😭
---
I swear in one of my later runs that thing hunted me down. First run I only saw it once, last run I got killed 5 times by it and it tracked me into an area with a lever. Most terrifying enemy in all of destiny.
---
You lucky bastard, he just vacuumed me right up
---
People complain because sweaty players bring them into quick play and play like their in a tournament.
---
That looks sick af where’d you get it?
---
Right before you fall into the maze if you look at the map in the control room looking area you can see a system alert for the robot getting lose/going crazy. It says TR3-VR.
---
legit didn't know this was a thing a ran right across it when I did it
---
Seriously, how is everybody forgetting this? It even makes a whip crack noise as you spin it.
---
What actually is it? I want to see a close-up of it.
---
To be fair Niobe lab's last or second ladt phase was broken and they had to fix it in a patch
---
Yeah, but people just call it Outbreak Prime since that was the name ofi it in D1. (Kinda like how In Y2 of D1 we got the Black Spindle but people called in Black Hammer. Same thing in D2 where when we got Whisper people called it Spindle/Hammer)
---
I completed the mission as people were still finding out what needed to happen so I had no warning on this maze portion. I just kept following vents until I dropped into it. Turned a corner and quickly shit my pants.
---
So that’s what he looks like.
---
It is a dungeon.
---
Fuck we had 37 seconds left when we finished it on our 4th. It was my fault every time too. Fucked up the elevators, the electrified street sweeper in the hallway and just didn’t get enough DPS going.
---
But they are still items with exotic rarity. Not IMO, it's written in item's manifests
---
Yes. If you're on PS4 I can help through it
---
That satisfying moment when your melee connects
---
We’re not talking about SBMM, we’re talking about people complaining about other people that inherently know how to play crucible, and asking them to play dumb in qp. That’s simply not going to happen. *Most* of these people that have pinnacle rewards have earned them because their ‘normal’ play style is them being specially aware. 
---
You can’t expect to casually walk around retribution in straight lines and not get your head blown off. 
---
Quickplay =/= No srategy
---
What platform are you on?
---
Where are some good shortcuts?
---
The game only went to the better after the forsaken dlc, and the community is also better :)
---
Especially you of all people, I let you keep it years ago because I thought you can control it.
---
You can use Outbreak and Inaugural so that’s a GG to PvP opponents
---
Basically gambit boss part
---
Guardians like you give me hope that I may one day earn my 7th column. 
---
I've been trying since season 3 when I got my first we ran out of medals and learned Seventh Column was even a thing. 
---
It makes me so excited to hear Shaxx say 
---
#Outstanding
---
As that means it's 2 away, usually someone fucks off at that point and I don't reach Phenomenal, but you made it the whole way!
---
I am proud of you. Good Job. No matter what anyone says, no one can take it away from you. 
---
Looking forward to watching your next one, and even more importantly, your next success.
---

---
The jumping puzzle one where there’s like two pieces of yellow bars, well what u do is get ur titan with lion rampart and shoulder charger, and you just jump down instead of going all the way around and then yea, it’s hard to explain I’ll make a video of it later ok?
---
You are nerfing a top tier reward for top tier play - meaning players that get luna/nf were rewarded for their skill...and now are removing it - why? Because we are using it? Using that logic, they should just remove pinnacle weapons in PvP. You can't reward players and then punish the small population that can succeed in the presribed roll. 
---
The other point about players being on a level playing field is effectively null, considering that there is already a skill gap - suggesting a natural advantage occurs regardless of the weapon.
---
I enjoy it when it's part of the rest of the game, and not the entire thing 
---
Also the suddenly the horde of enemies is just non-existent past this door thing bothers me.
---
Oh hey Jon
---
Go through the Warmind campaign to unlock Escalation Protocol and try farming for the three weapons, mainly the shotgun. Curse of Osiris doesn’t really have anything to go, but if you care about collecting things then go for the Verse weapons, but I don’t recommend going for them since they have Y1 rolls. You also get an Exotic ghost for getting all 11 weapons, but it’s not worth the grind. Forsaken is the bread and better of the game currently, so you’ll want to hit lvl 50 in order to progress towards the endgame. Once you beat its campaign, if you’re not lvl 50 by then, don’t pick up/decrypt any powerful or luminous engrams, you wanna make sure you get the biggest power boost possible. Now if you have or decide to get the annual pass, you can go straight to the newest activities and reach end game content faster by completing the Drifter’s power surge bounties. These bounties are so easy and quick to do, they’ll reward you 640 power gear with about an hour or two worth’s of game time. Being 640 not only puts you way above Forsaken’s endgame but your also strong enough to do the hardest Black Armory activities, including the raid. You also wanna get a few other weapons before attempting some of the heavier endgame activities. Going back to Warmind, once completing its campaign, you’ll want to get Sleeper Simulant. You’ll also want to get the Whisper of the Worm sniper. These two weapons are highly recommended for endgame activities, so you wanna make sure you get them. Watch some videos on how to get them as they may seem complicated to get at first. There are other exotic quests up for grabs if you’re interested, but their not that necessary, although you should definitely go for Ace of Spades. Other than I could keep going on and on but I think I’ve gone at it for a while. Anyways these are some tips if plan to play Destiny 2 in the long run. If you have any more questions feel free to ask away.
---
&gt;\^This guy gets it.
---
It was for a good cause! Be proud !
---
You need to finish enemy of my enemy questline.
---
Small mission spoiler ahead.
---
Ah yeah, you've got me there. I wish they'd add a few enemies, especially on the bit where you're outside, jumping from the two shipping containers and then on the ledges on the side of the tower. 11/10 would LOVE to see someone in my fireteam thrown/booped off the edge by a knight slam or captain punch.
---
Make sure you go back to Sloane and claim the legendary engram
---
Basically he called us for help without informing the vanguard. So we met up at the iron temple (Which is seen in the D2 map Vostok). From there Saladin told us to take care of SIVA for once and all.
---
In the flashback of the DLC, the iron lords were in rasputin's bunker when they "discovered SIVA" while on duty. Remember, they were the first type of guardians. No ghosts. As SIVA started surrounding the iron lords, forcing them to fight back, Rasputin closed its doors, locking them in. Saladin and Efrideet are the only known survivors who were not in the same room. **Around 300 years later** the Fallen have managed to reopen the chamber. Getting back to the replication chamber revealed something ugly. The rest of the iron lords have been mutated and what makes this even worse is....you need to kill all of them. After the boss fights, you literally planted a bomb and blew up the place.
---
There have been reports that this disease wasn't completely destroyed. It is one of the few reasons why the cosmodrome became a qurantine zone.
---
Outbreak Prime is SIVA weapon we obtained from the Wrath of the machine raid where we killed a SIVA-fied Archon. I don't even know why the hell we risk something like that.
---
It's messed up. Especially because the creators of Rasptuin also created SIVA. Bray.
---
You thought that Outbreak Prime was the only thing that was perfected?
---
Now since forsaken dropped, I hear everything is basically as it should be and it's worth playing again
---
At the same time though Destiny 1 and 2 have always had platforming elements to it.
---
I honestly really enjoy that section, it breaks up the intense combat nicely before you hit the boss.
---
So because I'm good enough to get both guns solo que, I can't hop into quickplay and play how I want to? What if I just want to enjoy my time and have a stress free destiny session? That doesn't make sense. What if I have a limited amount of time and can only play for a few minutes, but I want to get a round in? Should I play competitive and then quit out because my skill "level" is too high for quickplay? Your points make zero sense, sir.
---
Yes it was. Nova Warp took no energy to detonate and was AoE on every attack. You just ran around the map holding down right trigger and detonating a nova bomb sized explosion any time you wanted to. It also healed you and came with a teleport to dodge anything that could shut you down. If a Thundercrash was used, it could one shot the titan out of it before it impacted. If a tether was used it could one shot the tether ball before it activated and suppressed it. And it could kill through walls and around corners. There was no escape from it. At least you could run from spectral blades and you can team shot striker titans.
---
It would 100% agree. It’s worth the purchase of Forsaken. Plus you get the missing DLC that you don’t have yet
---
And when he comes back at the end, his ship shoots at you.
---
Leviathan or Eater of Worlds are good starter raids
---
Yes. The person that does the glitch stays in orbit and keeps the timer from starting. Finished  this on my second try and I didn't kill a single enemy. Guide is on YouTube https://youtu.be/vn9laeapoz4
---
Even Vuvuzela would laugh at this.
---
Death; I am inevitable.
---
Thanks my guy!
---
Lmao it’s Baldi
---
I have a clip of him slamming me against the wall ;)
---
Trevor is inevitable
---
Next stop, Catalyst time
---
This is a Strandbeest, a "walking machine". If you look at Trevor's design, his bottom half looks to be inspired by these.
---
Prime are 3-4 higher than the item in that slot. 
---
Powerful are 1-2 higher than your overall, and might not drop higher than what was in that slot already.
---
No, that’s Trevor.
---
Amazing
---
I understand. He's so rough, he literally pinned me to the door and ate my ass.
---
Good one
---
I swear I expected the skyrim meme when the screen turned black.
---
Yes, you can reach power level 300 without any DLC. The only way to do this are the handful of weekly challenges marked by gold icons on the director. For example, "do 3 strikes," "do a nightfall," "do 5 crucible matches," or the flashpoint. 
---
If you own DLC, it works the exact same, except that instead of needing to do these specific activities to get from 260 to 300 you have to do them to get from 500 to 700 (increasing to 750 when the next DLC is released), but there are A LOT more activities each week that give gear to raise your power level.
---
His name from now on is Trevor got it.
---
Fear TREVOR
---
Before i can, i must consult with the elder gods
---
lol.  No one who hasn't done the basic version of the mission really has the right to demand "KWTD".  (And if they've completed it, they wouldn't be in LFG themselves.)
---
Watch a video of a playthrough so you know the route, and you'll be good enough for literally any LFG group.
---
It does, same 20 mins as before. No question is stupid. :)
---
Well they ARE making new ones at about the same rate that they're revamping old favs.  Considering how many people DO want old guns back, they seem to be doing a pretty good job of catering to all groups.
---
Before we get that exotic TREV’ll sweep us
---
Yes he’ll sweep us for ever
---
Oh he’ll kill us 
---
Oh that fucking doomba
---
Oh he’ll make us so stressed out for the rest of this quest
---
And this gun that we get
---
Better be the damn best
---
I just go tit myself its a great emblem. Can be a little tough.
---
You can remake that with Warlock's sit emote.
---
hol up didn’t we blow up the replication chamber
---
Good job at covering their username?
---
god damnit trevor
---
Every step the questline requires is in the basegame though, does it restrict you from starting zero hour quest or something like that?
---
What Scullion said 👆.  You should be able to get the bounty quest from Sloane though.
---
I’m glad you love the game but they can’t lower power level req for base players bc then what’s the point of increase power cap with every expansion.
---
Yup plus the hunter narrating is a friend of mithrax probably jealous of us doing a heist
---
Get the 640 quick level up bounties from Drifter.
---
Yea but thing is on the road map, these thing was kinda advertised as free to all players, I don't want to be persuaded to buy the DLC I just want the stupid weapon. I can't do this, I literally can't do damage to the enemies.
---
How can I grab it from Sloane, is it just waiting there for me?
---
My first run through was a bit frustrating, but once you get used to the adds and shields it’s fun as hell
---
The rat kings crew
---
Yup plus the hunter is a friend of mithrax and is probably jealous of us for doing a heist with him
---
What’s the contradicting statement? You can’t do damage bc you’ve decided to stay at vanilla
---
Only to 50 LL, so a 650 activity played by 700's is still significantly easier. Certain activities do as you said, but things like normal strikes don't.
---
I know that, but why would he need the Siva?
---
Clanmates: Finds door marked exit
---
Me: Flips a switch "the door open?"
---
Clanmates: Silence
---
Me: Strolls over to door, so the door isn't open then? The thing is nearby.
---
Clanmates: "Its ok it doesn't head down this hallway."
---
Me: Staring at Trevor turning into hallway. "He does now"
---
Three grown men screaming like girls ensues.
---
I hate this bot.
---
\&gt;Died in elevator phase
---
\&gt;Respawned in the maze
---
\&gt;Gets IMMEDIATELY rekt by Trevor
---
\&gt;Spawns in the control room before the maze
---
Wait, he is trying to stop the devils who are there for the siva, isnt he?
---
He doesn't. All he was in it for was to stop the House of Devils from getting Siva, and to build more trust with us.
---
it should just be there in her inventory, like when you buy a piece of armor or pick up a bounty from her.

Just 1 hit the servitors before they can immune ezpz
---
Absolutely. Last wish is 580, and Leviathan is somewhere around 300? Only raid you wouldn't be able to do is Scourge of The Past.
---
If you have the annual pass (Black Armory) try out blast furnace, or its forsaken counterpart, Go Figure. They're both four burst agressive frames instead of the normal 3 burst and work similar to vigilance but since it can get random rolls you can get some really great perks. If you need help getting it feel free to add me

If vaccines work, then how come unvaccinated children are a threat to vaccinated ones?
---
I’ve got my shit together at around the fifth attempt (I reached the boss room). Adds were not so tough but fuck the shields. Last battle turrets were to beefy
---
I want that chest piece
---
But it's technically not. That's my point. They say it's free for everyone but not everyone can shell out the $40 DLC (forsaken) you need to get to a reasonable power level to get through zero hour.
---
Just walk in there and grab it.

 Xbox
---
Tbh this is exactly as intended. It's so people will chase it. It's so people who haven't gotten the season pass will cave just to reach 700pl. It's a lure
---
In a month or so after the hype is gone and the bitching gets louder it will be brought in line with other weapons.
---
without the timer it would be extremely easy.
---
Professor Layton is the best DS game (besides mario kart) to ever exist.
---
Change my mind
---
Also vaccines don’t cover every disease, some kids who are very sick and have a weak immune system could be killed by anti vaccination people
---
I watched 1 video and made it through my second time with a couple friends that almost two-manned it.
---
Damn that's unlucky, and could someone help me out with this?
---
Update: I played a few matches with sweaty friends and just ended up getting it!
---
Prospector is def more flexible. Void rockets with tractor cannon is still as good as ever though
---
5x bad omen with cluster +1 tractor is strong as hell.
