Nah, Petras should be required and they're fixing it. There are ways to prevent a guitar. Without ruining your Petras. Like giving first runner fireteam lead or making sure you remove all bricks you can see in vault before riven. Its an issue with a known cause. You can circumvent it. Or wait till it its fixed late january early February like they announced.

---
Uhhh... because. Because they're space intakes! Yeah, I'll go with that. I have no idea what else they could be to be honest. I'm not very fancy on engineering or anything so I have no clue other than maybe the artist thought they looked cool? And because space magic.

Base game means no DLC. No Curse of Osiris, no Warmind, no Forsaken, no Black Armory. Missing out on a lot, but

Sorry. Pulse not fusion üôÑ

I don't get how people use this thing in pvp, the ammo just goes away so quickly, do you have tips on using it in pvp?

Damn Daniel, nice vans.

Good idea. Shame you can't get the Year 1 Iron Banner gear anymore.
---
I couldn't get Forsaken until a month after release. Sucks to be left behind. I hope you at least got the Solstice of Heroes stuff so you can hit Power Level 400.
---
To this day, I have never truly been as intrigued by any piece of lore, so much as back when we were slowly uncovering new information about this superiour nefarious race, the Mahjarrat, and the ritual that called them all to the ritual marker hidden away in the mountains every 500 years. Just describing it gives me goosebumps, I still love the lore but like all things, theyre usually better when you know less.
---
WAKANDA FOREVER!
---
Wait base game players can get to 400 now?
---
I get all that. But how do you prevent what happened to me today? You literally can‚Äôt. It was just some bug because the encounter is so glitchy and bad. And to loose because of game error is so frustrating. Guitar is one thing. But what happened today? That‚Äôs ridiculous. You have 2 glitches you need to worry about, and one is literally something you can‚Äôt fix or prevent from happening. It just random if the game decides to screw you. It‚Äôs not right
---
It's a laser the same family as coldhart and Prometheus lens. But I did not know this exsisted either before today.

Absolutely agree, for me it peaked when I started seeing it all come together and the God Wars were erupting again, the end of Guthix, Sliske and Zamorak squabbling of the Stone of Jas, whispers of the Elder Gods, Mah and her children, Zaros and Seren.

I made it to the Boss Fight last night on my Titan, and got to last phase with less than a 1/4 health left. Went in with Missle and then Ikelos shotgun.. only to get stomped back and immediately die by hitting a wall. Looks like I‚Äôm not getting Izanami unlocked on my Titan. ;~;
---
I spot a high value scallywag on the field, take em out
---
All the classes had their best supers nerfed though. Spectral Blades got its armor and length nerfed, the two most broken parts of it. And on the bright side dawnblade and Nova bomb are getting buffed so Skull of dire ahamkra can become meta soon
---
It comes from scourge of the past raid. 
---
smoke them if you got them, skillbreaker is the only reason i stayed sane during the breakneck grind
---
I could be wrong but I believe armour can only drop at the end of each encounter, or raid chests. Tends to be only a few of these per raid, and you can only run a raid for new drops once per week, per character. I mean, you might luck out on Leviathan and get all pieces from clearing encounters and the keys, but RNG could just as easily give you all Mob Justices (I think that was the raid SMG - I always trashed them...)
---
5 runs for a specific weapon with not one, but two specific perks is really unlikely. Of course it‚Äôs possible but it‚Äôs very unlikely. 
---
I do like a Claws of the Wolf, but my Bygones is much more stable.

I'm a bit shit at invading, each to their strengths yo

Yes but since gambit isnt a part of crucible, you don't have to worry about glory or honor. The ranking system is literally called infamy. So go be the worst person you can be. &gt;:)

I don‚Äôt get what you‚Äôre ‚Äúso close‚Äù to

2nd try i fell off a cliff very early in. 3rd try I got it.

I‚Äôd add that the lore highly implies that she can she the future and affect it. She has known she will become a god for some time. She knows the path and whether she likes it or not the traveler is part for the path.
---
For examples refer to sjur eido first death being prevented, the comment she makes about uldren would be being a different version of himself post oryx event (could mean riven controlled, could mean recent events).  I think there were others. 
---
can you do me a favour and never call it that again
---
Shit, i really want this shader i hope you can get it in bergusia forge too
---
Two past DLCs, Forsaken, Forge. Definitely around $150 if not more. 
---
37.0
---
You forgot the fact that CoO and Warmind are included in Forsaken now, Forasaken + Annual Pass are 70 afaik unless its different on console and you're talking about that
---
The legendary collection is the base game with the ‚ÄúForsaken‚Äù expansion which now includes the two previous DLC‚Äôs (Curse of Osiris and Warmind). Go back on the store and look under purchases and it should give you the download option if it‚Äôs not already in your download list. Or check your notification tab on the main screen 
---
It's $60 for forsaken + past dlc, then another $30 for the annual pass
---
Light level is not considered in cruicible

comes in to support a teammate that was already in an engagement, teammate ends up losing because it wasn‚Äôt 2v1 from the start, now both fucked.

Mobility doesn't increase sprint speed.

I joined a sos raid cause someone crashed and i opened the chest before we did final boss and got it from that chest on my first time doing the raid, sorry.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt that be the Fallen, not Hive?
---
Cant find the good joke you mentioned
---
As somebody watching JoJo for the first time, hell yeah.

‚ÄúSometimes better players than yourself‚Äù referring to one eyed mask. Omegalol

I've seen really bad players with luna and nf but mayb they were drunk or something, I get it
---
Jesus, what kind of timeline did they have where they couldn't squeeze in the handful of lines during production?
---
Honestly, it's just starting to sound like Nathan Fillion is getting too big for video games.
---
There was an event called the Solstice of Heroes a while back, before forsaken. You could get the set of armor you started the game with, solstice armor(scorched) with 200 power, and complete sets of missions to upgrade it. The armor could be upgraded to a rekindled set with 340 power level all the way to a 400 power level resplendent set. The final set could also be masterworked upon completing an addditional set of missions. The missions in question required guardians to wear the set, as well as complete five "redux" missions, basically harder versions of existing campaign missions, as well as some other random stuff.(get x kills with y weapon etc.)
---
You're correct there guardian. If you got the base game $70 is all you need to get the bundle on console. 
---
You'd be surprised how busy an actor is when working on something.
---
Yeah, passed the first part of the not forgotten quest and all I seem to run into are coils but it is what it is
---
But Cayde‚Äôs ghost is female 
---
It randomly has a chance to be on Black Armory weapons and gear. 
---
You are right, it does not increase sprint speed, but it does increase walking speed, jump height, and, most importantly, strafe speed.
---
Thanks for your help! I was, indeed, dumb and bought an expansion for a game I don't have. Unfortunately, there is no such 'Base game' of Destiny 2 on the PlayStation store ([https://store.playstation.com/en-ca/grid/search-game/1?query=destiny%202](https://store.playstation.com/en-ca/grid/search-game/1?query=destiny%202)). I'm not exactly keen on the 79.99 for the Legendary edition, so I'll keep looking for other solutions. 
---
It‚Äôs what you jack off to when you‚Äôre really congested. 
---
lemme post it next week guys
---
Congrats!
---
What did you achieve here other than ignoring the LORE
---
When you do a mission that is labeled ‚Äúheroic‚Äù that means it has 3
---
modifiers, of which are many but it will always have 3 modifiers, one will be an element that does more damage, one that benefits the enemies and one that benefits the player.
---
If you are doing a heroic activity pull out your ghost and press down on the d pad to see what modifiers there are and what they do
---
Jealous!
---
You use them to infuse gear and masterwork weapons. Save them for close to or at max level so you can infuse all your best gear with the perks you like.
---
Little yellow crystal thing in your inventory. 
---
The lack of a quiver bothers you?  Where do we keep ammo from any other gun?  Realistically i think they're stored on the ship and ghost transmats them. 
---
Also because video game. 
---
This post is üíØ 
---
I have experienced both and I think the IB pulse is trash. Especially if being compared to Bygones.
---
Ooooohh now that‚Äôd be nice
---
Honestly that‚Äôs never happened to me, soooo....

"Hive you been ;))))?"
---
And its glorious, although ironically enough I got a rand roll of exactly that this go round.

More like 5 minutes. I tried the Levi strat and just couldn‚Äôt do it. Saw this, gave it a try, and was done with it in 5 minutes. Thank you for this. 
---
Can I get a care package in a size Large?
---
I propose "fuckgoblins" for their name

Take a chill pill, get over it. No idea why you're acting all salty.
---
Didn‚Äôt know they had a black age of triumph shirt from D1, I have the blue one
---
lemme get that FWC o.o 
---
All that I can remember from lone wold is very long queue time and jaw dropping lag.
---
You can 360 no-scope them, melee to the side and wip around to face them, you'll start throwing the knife/bomb since there's no one in front of you, then it hits them in the face when you're facing them. it really should be able to just work at close range the way the new warlock arc-melee works tho :/
---
I love your flair btw
---
This one is navy, but different than the one we had shipped. I would love a black one!
---
I saw a daily reset post with no comments, decided to type ‚ÄúHi‚Äù, I have like 15 downvotes rn, if it isn‚Äôt a complaint or suggestion they don‚Äôt wanna hear it
---
the 850k is not active player its the amount of tracked players (has nothing to do with actual active playerbase)
---
[https://destinytracker.com/destiny/reports/daily-population](https://destinytracker.com/destiny/reports/daily-population)
---
" We've removed this chart because people are using it to spread a false narrative of the Destiny 2 player population. Daily Unique users is a misleading statistics to use as basis for the active population of the game, any game in that matter. Not everyone plays video games 24/7, besides maybe at launch. We hoped our article would've cleared this up a bit but it seems it hasn't. To halt people from making false narratives based on the numbers we provide we decided to stop showing them in this chart. "
---
I love when people check their facts right. 
---
those old numbers / whole stats of this site is taken from blizzard api , when game fail and company dont want you to see those numbers they just break it (same happened to bf5 there is no actual stats because ea hide it)
---
I dont even going to comment on rest of the things, because you keep playing the "fact" game and you are just hypocrite that dont check your own facts..
---
Until they remove a weapon from the game entirely, using any weapon you like is "playing fairly", OP. Why you gotta be so salty about it? You're top of the match with a pulse? Good job! Takes skill and dedication to be that solid, but don't shit on people for playing it how they want. 
---
I'm gonna be honest... Same...
---
Fun
---
It's only available on the weekends
---
It spawns in different locations and only on Friday/Saturday/Sunday/Monday any other day your wasting your time. Also if you finish the event it despawns look it up on YouTube to see the two locations it can spawn at. 
---
First, do not worry about getting your power level up until you have reached power level 500. Up until that point, absolutely *any* activity will give you gear that raises your power level.
---
Once you reach 500, only activities that specify they will give "powerful gear" will raise your power level. I don't know if [this list is 100% complete, but it has most of them.](https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9epi7c/im_not_sure_some_of_you_appreciate_just_how_many/). Powerful gear challenge and bounties reset every week on Tuesdays, so be sure to do them all within the week. 
---
Really cause I swear I did it on a Thursday my first time and it worked or I'm just a retard
---
Or Brawler was on of it was a heroic strike or story mission. 
---
RIP
---
What was wormhusk before the nerf? It still gives health right?
---
All those red legion aren‚Äôt bringing their best tho
---
Just a question. Does anyone but Mara know Uldren is alive again?
---
2nd this, BE NOTORIOUS
---
As far as I know, only the powerful frames. 
---
This person gets it.
---
More seriously, play whatever guns you like using with the barricades and grenades you prefer. Mess around and try it out a bit to see what feels natural for you. 
---
PAWS ON THE SURFACE OF YOUR MIND
---
No
---
thanks, good to know i put in work and people like it 
---
I would just pay the 35 bucks and get to 650 faster than I could get 136 enhancement cores lol
---
I will shit on people using op shit for wins. Its cheesy, and cheap. It‚Äôs exploiting which should be shat on. Happens with most other games and it gets balanced. Should be the same for this. Thankfully I‚Äôve finished the iron banner bounties now so I don‚Äôt have to touch that cancerous mode
---
Hunter is now the slow class 
---
playing well is just practice, the more you do it the better you will play, and i play regular scrims so i get to play some top teir people and that helps me get better 
---
Nice SRL shirt, wish I had a friend that works for Bungie.
---
man that shit sucks... I‚Äôve heard mixed answers, some people got it from regular frames which is why I was asking for a legit answer bro. But thanks for clarifying.
---
Beside it isn't.
---
Though the duration with gwen is stupidly long the base length is fine.
---
And the reason they added the resistance was the fact everyone kept shooting them in the face practically insta killing them the second they seen an moving blob.
---
But unlike nova which gives you health on kills (which is broken seeing you could in theory live forever) you dont get that luxury on spectral.
---
Oh, thank you for clarifying. This hive spacefuckery really makes my head spin.
---
Working 
---
It‚Äôs tucked away in the photo, but, that‚Äôs a treasure. Bring SRL back!
---
Oh, if they got it from regular frames, then I suppose it must be possible. I have never heard of someone getting from a regular frame, so I am guessing it is a much lower drop chance than the powerful frames. 
---
yeah fair enough, when i make montages i only put in clips with sniper and hand cannon (no nf or luna)
---
You should be able to get a copy of the base version's disc for dirt cheap. It's probably your best option even if you normally only buy digital.
---
Do you mean the drifter or me? Regardless I agree.
---
The Whisper mission is only available from Friday, starting at the daily rest, until Monday, ending at the daily reset. 
---
did you say 7 clears? and then proceed to say worth the wait. Mate you are super brave thats gonna piss of some guardians there. Mine took 26 clears to get
---
AAARRGGHITE AAAARGHITE AAAARRRGGHHHITE!
---
Heyyyyyyyyy that‚Äôs me :)
---
Ironically the need didnt even fix spectral. The issue is with gwen not the base super. Nerfing the super and you're just forcing all those players into using gwen and use gamey strats even more so.
---
if ur really trying to learn, its the bottom right corner one. its suppression grenade. getting hit by it disable ALL of ur abilities, in including super. iirc it can also disable ur double jump, but in not sure, but it sure as fuck can make u panic
---
I couldnt even play, with evryone being level 50
---
Wait 40 seconds of doing nothing or 40 seconds of spamming heavy attacks?
---
only available Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. 
---
I feel like the number of public events active per planet is the same, so since the EDZ is such a big area, you should broaden your search. Every 4 minutes or so, check the map for public event flags. You can sometimes tell by where the flag is what the event is going to be. 
---
Why? Of all posts why copy this one?
---
I always hear "Rick Cactus".
---
 The lore really is good. I think it‚Äôs my favorite fictional world. That and the fallout games.
---
No, that's the Dawning lore book. Eva's Journey was in the game before the Dawning. 
---
Yes, the only way to get these lore pages is randomly upon completion of heroic story missions. 
---
I‚Äôd love to sail the seas of Titan
---
[blames activision]
---
Yeah, all the events are spawning apart from the one I'm attempting to complete, which is what is baffling me.
---
Glimmer extraction happens at aa few places but for cabal rather than fallen, so it's weird to me that the only fallen glimmer extraction isn't spawning. Real bizarre. 
---
u/ZeCube cringe or nah
---
Thanks for the unintentional promotion. :)
---
I got riskrunner catalyst from killing a lost sector boss :\
---
Anyone* 
---
Yikes, a relic of 2014
---
The length of the regular super I might agree but armor 100% needed a nerf. No reason it should be the tankiest super in the game
---
Get your rock off my map
---
If you find and destroy all 40 of them with the Wish Ender exotic bow you will get a taken themed sparrow
---
I think we all know how this story ends 
---
Am I the only one that wouldnt mind having his sniper in my inventory?
---
Noone else in my raid group has one yet. They were so mad when I got a second one and had to leave it on the floor.

Unplayable 0/10

i'm autistic/ we've been doing adventures not patrols

Or Gambit, now that you can‚Äôt see the roster until after the match starts, I just assume it‚Äôs a full fire team.
---
&gt; nothing changed regarding Rasputin
---
He started speaking Russian, but backwards.
---
That's a pretty big change in my book!

I'm always so grateful when guardians know to stand in the Well to help charge it

more importantly,  you get closer to earning that cursebreaker title.

Shuro chi. Wells everywhere. A petra‚Äôs run necessity
---
I'm on 50 and still hunting
---
Exactly, although on very few occasions I've been killed through the OEM hp and shield right after getting the vengeance kill but it's a similar problem to Warlock's devour perk. There's like a slight delay or lag to it so you can get killed nano seconds after getting it. I completely agree though, compared to D1 exotics, the exotics we have now aren't that powerful and especially the year 1 exotics we have.
---
I see that you also want the No Land Beyond (his sniper). Hopefully there is a quest to obtain it. 
---
Btw, No Land Beyond is a D1 exotic that uses primary ammo
---
If that buddy needs any more buddies DM me
---
As a D2 hunter who never got to play D1 finally got one of the weapons that I have heard the most in the game. And I can‚Äôt be more happy !!! Ty !! 
---
#MotW
---
that makes sense, I‚Äôll keep trying. I already have a Blast Furnace with feeding frenzy kill clip rasmussein steady rounds and I‚Äôm burned farming lol. 
---
Thanks to a quick google search I just found  that out. 
---
Now a primary ammo sniper I could get behind. Legendary tho. Not exotic. 
---
Now you‚Äôve gotta decide on your faction and burn the other two, FWC! 
---
hi buddy 
---
Was that a JoJo reference!
---
Bungie. Can we get a mini game with devrim kay. A snip off. Winner gets a NLB
---
Subsithoughtifellfor
---
Wish they would put D1 on pc so I could play it all over again
---
They also act as if every single titan have that exotic. It's more likely you'll meet a titan spamming shoulder tackle wearing insurmountable skullfort than one with OEM. 
---
When I leave Destiny for months I always come across a lore video that is fully responsible for bringing me back. 
---
Wow. Nice. 
---
I want all of it in 3xL but I want the bag mostly. Being a female it's hard. I am so picky about my bags and that destiny bag I really like alot. Wish I could get my hands on it!

---
You can play earlier, but I‚Äôd recommend getting up to level 20 first so you at least have your base classes fully unlocked.
---
Level advantage disabled means there is no damage bonus/reduction for level differences, but at very low levels you‚Äôll still definitely be outgeared and lacking your class abilities.
---
Maybe we wouldnt have to pay extra for DLC if they didnt spend money on useless crap like this... and then gave it away for free.

Just stop pls

My shoulder charge is trying to make up for something else that is lacking so stop ok thanks

Can he be my friend too

Right
---
I've gotten close to 20 kills in one life but to think 50 in a control match. Just reminds me of Call of Duty WW2, absolutely insane bounties that require godlike skills to complete. 50 kills in a 75 kill deathmatch game. Activision had their meaty hands on that game, that's why I blame them.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been playing the game since the beta of D1 so I know what you mean by a roller coaster of a ride. 
---
I was just being sarcastic since the game has blowen up recently. Didn‚Äôt think about the fact that sarcasm usually doesn‚Äôt get translated well over the Internet. 
---
That‚Äôs my favorite shirt I own. SRL was the best thing ever
---
Edit: Change 'Spade Cyclone' and 'Spray and Play' around, I must've mixed those two up
---
That‚Äôs some Qui Gon Jin stuff right there. Except this time you‚Äôre doing the stabbing. 
---
Well, no, the reason why they removed it and only had it on weekends/rotating was because of the abysmal player count. It's why games like Overwatch, a completely PvP centric game, have very few playlists.
---
Now imagine that only about 15-20% of the playerbase even plays PvP regularly. Yeah you absolutely can not split up the playlists.
---
Tiny player count of sweaty players = insanely sweaty games and lag. It's no secret why solo only playlists fail in nearly every game they're attempted in. 
---
Nice!! It‚Äôs definitely a good one to have. What system are you on?
---
NEW MONARCHY FOREVER
---
Your friend is probably takeing care yourself about huge fans. I like bungie. You receive package form bungie. you are very special. Your buddy who‚Äôs working form bungie. Do you like the package form your friend

I always suspected the traveler was evil... 
---
Pre-*rework* Wormhusk started health regen. You could run it with high recovery, and have pretty much all your health by the end of the dodge animation. Now, it heals a moderate, set amount.
---
I emphasize *rework* because it was, in fact, a buff in certain situations. For instance if you got shot in the middle of your dodge, you didn‚Äôt get any health because the regen stopped. Now, you get the set amount, which is usually enough to tank an extra couple of bullets. That‚Äôs a big buff for PvE, given how constant bullet spray and lack of cover is a staple of some activities.
---
Care package? I had to put in WORK for some of those shirts! 
---
*tech support. Have you tried turning it off and on again?*
---
Unorganized desktop

Too bad you can‚Äôt experience it pre-nerf

That thing literally melted boss

You lucky son of a gun..

I love you and I hate you
---
Iron Truage was the Y1 IB set and is no longer obtainable. The app hasn't ever updated that to reflect the current set for some dumb reason
---
Why can‚Äôt I have a friend that works at Bungie.  
---
Why? What's wrong with having it? I dont even have one of those fallen mods yet 
---
Pretty much, and it's harder
---
You can.
---
It's 15 flat for tracking + extra time to get the bonus if kills.
---
Lol I want one now
---
Ikr, the boss fiht is such a joke as well just camp the platform with whisper
---
I don't seem to have that problem with mine, if I hit them with 1 arrow chances are they are going to die.  The Dragonfly works great at long ranges when the mobs are close together, I routinely take out 2 -4 mobs.
---
Winning the 1v1 can oftentimes (in my experience from playing with MY teammate running OEM) win a 1v2 after the previous battle. The true sight vision it gives is way too much notably for its length and potential. It makes titan supers practically unkillable, grants position information for too long (very helpful in stacks with comms), and grants an overshield that can literally absorb a top tree golden gun shot (which, you know, is a super...)
---
Better than your average :)
---
I've dedicated my Titan existence to not being "that guy"...I mostly use my Breakneck in PvP FFS!
---
I'll be honest, whenever insee things like this, what i really see is
---
Buff my play style 
---
Nerf things I don't like/die to. 
---
You might not think it's the case but be honest it is.
---
You can buy the actual seal when you get it in the bungie store 
---
It‚Äôs because they are both bald 
---
Wait, you can die from your own sleeper lasers?
---
Got a shipment from Fenchurch I see?
---
If I were you, I would send it back. 
---
Honestly, our character is essentially DoomGuy in destiny. The surrounding NPCs spot a problem in need of fixing, tell us we'll get loot for it, and the problem is reduced to blood stains on the floor. We are the scariest thing in the game, and we've got infinite respawns.
---
I'll give you my soul in exchange for the new monarchy shirt 
---
God I would love to play a gambit match with someone wearing ursas. 6 shot goldie standing in an empowering rift with a well on top, an banner shield and melting point is something I see in my dreams.
---
To be fair, the deploy on its immune orbs is not really clearly telegraphed, so it's less "incorrect" timing than unforunate timing.
---
Seriously nerf this overshield bullshit, Titan goes in with Jootun and one eyed mask and its a fucking overshield spam that you can‚Äôt counter 1 on 1. This isn‚Äôt balance nor healthy for the game.
---
Who is he? Asking ~~to make~~ for a friend.
---
Kinda common sense, at least among console players,  that button is normally the ‚Äúback‚Äù button
---
Wait I didn't even know that existed lmao where did you get it

You're right. Probs Zavalla and Cayde and now Zavalla has moved to master Rahool. 
---
It works normally as far as I can tell.

How do I get friends like that

Jokes aside, I heard it doesn‚Äôt even stand up correctly

Can i borrow your friend or like ... adopt him?
---
It doesn't. It's got the corners sticking out but no platform or flat part or anything, and the way they are angled makes it impossible to set it down without being at a weird angle. Unless you literally make something yourself it's always sitting diagonally and looks shitty. Plus it feels like really crappy plastic.
---
Best part? It's just a shitty Bluetooth speaker, you can get the Alexa Ghost app without it and do all the same shit.

This is terrifying tbh. I would throw mine out the window if it did this to me.

I've always said that if they made an exotic that reduced the damage taken from the various suicide mobs, I'd never take it off.

Titans Tolerance:
---
"The warlocks said that concussive force wasn't like the poisonous leaves outside the city. They said repeatedly exposing myself wouldn't build an immunity. They were wrong."
---
That has nothing to do with the number that I gave you. I never claimed it was the concurrent playerbase, I said that it was the amount of people that logged in to the game yesterday in total, not at once. The total tracked playerbase is 13.8 million. It's on the homepage of their site. 
---
I did check my facts, you're just talking about a completely different thing. They removed the concurrent playerbase number, not the one they currently have on their website. 
---
It's not broken. They removed a separate number. 
---
I did check my facts, you just started rambling about a completely separate statistic.
---
You're not responding to it because you can't. You haven't played the game, and you're criticising it on your assumption of it. When you get called out you run. 
---
I bought that one 2 days ago. Its pretty cool. 
---
EP also has a ship and ghost shell 
---
Can you only get if from the final encounter? Or also from other encounters? 
---
I'm opening up the other toys I got on clearance.
---
There's a Titan with the Helm of Saint-14 and a rather large Shaxx.
---
The Shaxx comes with another free shader.
---
I'll likely put that up for grabs in a few minutes.
---
My friend gave me the shaxx one for my birth day like 2 weeks ago. Its pretty epic. 
---
Has never happened to me. You might wanna fix your own shit. 
---
Ever thought about cleaning up your desktop, that's a lot of icons my man, 85 OF THEM.
---
I'll suggest getting a program called Fences if you want to have lots of stuff on the desktop, that way some stuff can be hidden and not clutter it up.
---
OnT; I'm mad jealous my man, your pal is a great mate. I hope you thanked him good. 
---
Nope did I call you OP? ReAdINg ComPReHenSiOn FTW"

Its pretty obvious anyone complaining about the Telesto nerf while calling people "shotgun apes" are either telesto users or just terrible at PvP. So if youre not the former than youre the latter.
---
3 precision shots activated the normally 5 shot explosion would be cool
---
A bottle of blue will work.

Fuck the Mars Sparrow..... Why does the game make you wait sooooo long to get the first Sparrow?! Pretty tired of running, and running, and walking, and RUNNING AGAIN to start a fucking mission!

My bad I'm new to reddit didn't see my notifs, idk whats in the dlc and whats not, but bows and weapons with dragonfly are pretty great

Looks kinda like a muscular Ultron

I like gambit
---
Year One I was rocking EoW armor and I was just a huge beefy boy, but it looked cool. With the forge and new raid out though...this is, by far, the sexiest my Titan has ever been. Not too beefy, but just right. Trying to work on my hunter and warlock now.
---
That is an epic care package, worthy of my jealousy! 
---
I'm not talking about needing a walkthrough but a nudge in the right direction would be good. (Again, not talking about end game content but just general gameplay).
---
Every new person I played with always has to ask at some point:  "what do I do now?". And then usually 5 to 10 minutes of explanation is needed to explain how the game works.
---
I don't mind having to discover stuff myself, I just think the game could do with more help about different mechanics of the game.

Put a titan bubble, go in it with your sleeper and shoot :)
---
As a Warlock I mostly choose to either jump away and let it blow itself up or shoot them from a safe distance, preferably with something that causes more explosions, because explosions are cool. Way cooler than a dull thud. 
---
Nolan North is *amazing* at this - lots of people probably wouldn't notice if no one told them before or afterwards.
---
He's managed to nail most of his voice, quirks, intonation, all that good stuff.
---
Like yea; when you know it, you can tell them apart, and I also think it's sad Nathan Fillion couldn;t do the last outing of his own character. (I'm pretty gay for him tbh).
---
But Bungie's plan B was.. good enough?
---
Alright.
---
If it's the one on the bridge in the EDZ, you can kind of get around it by double-jumping from a pile of rocks around the left that just about gets you onto the bridge past the guy. At least, it works with a Hunter, not sure about the other classes. 
---
I‚Äôm not your friend pal
---
Holy shit really? Where hahaha
---
then its gonna be 666 light level when season of the drifter hits
---
What's the point of dunemarchers, lightweight or mida? Just jump LOOOOOL 4HEad
---
well after they nerfed the  Wormhusk Crown from the Hunter because it was to strong. 
---
Now its the Ultimate from warlock
---
upcomming, one eyed mask from titan wich is even more powerfull than Wormhusk ever was.
---
lets see what the jokers wild is gonna give us.

Jealous. I‚Äôve been wanting either a H√§kke or a Suros shirt forever but haven‚Äôt found anything like what I‚Äôm looking for. You need to tell your buddy that Bungo should step up their general merch game. Increase the loot table!!
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 13.
---
/r/Fireteams 
---
On the subject of titans...if you're in gambit please use melting point.
---
Oh this is evil. I like it.
---
Some subclasses of Titans are completely useless. Bottom tree sunbreaker, bottom tree striker, even middle tree sunbreaker. Titans are arguably the strongest class in the game right now. Just those supers kind of feel useless when there's much better options. the other subclasses have a lot of potential but why use a hammer that burns when you can use melting point and a hammer that explodes? I hope I closed the gap on why certain subclasses need a buff for you.
---
Nice, you will love it.Super fun to use
---
That would actually be pretty fun, aside getting sniper by golden gun and rushed by one eyed
---
Oem is not problem and im main hunter.  I jusr want hunters ability buff to compete with supernova and shoulder charge
---
I use all 3,  I have the OEM and I still prefer pvp on my warlock/hunter over my Titan.
---
For the most part it‚Äôs supers. No Titan super is as long as the nova warp or as devastating as blade barrage - spectral blades is just ridiculous in pvp.
---
Warlocks can heal easily. Hunters have really good mobility and dodges for pvp.  A barricade just needs a grenade thrown over it.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs why they nerfed locks and hunters - I honestly would just rather they buff titan supers (make burning maul relevant pls)
---
I started my warlok about 2 weeks ago and this will be my setup as soon as I have them all:
---
PVE: Luna 
---
PVP: Controversial Hold
---
Gambit: Geomag ( except we already have 2)
---
Raid: Luna (except we use Whisper (SotP) then Phoenix Protocol)
---
As said currently running 24/7 Luna bc I don't have any Forsaken once

Which armor you have equipped ? I am ~620 power titan and mine looks like a hobo so I am curious.
---
/r/sharditorkeepit
---
&gt;That and they're the fastest class in the game.
---
Can you explain why you think this? A Warlock with Blink, Transversive Steps, MIDA and max mobility is the fastest build in the game, completely undisputed. We are all roughly the same but Warlock's blink with maxed mobility increases displacement by a considerable amount, pushing it way beyond any other class in the game.
---
Even if we include supers, Warlock dawnblade goes faster than Sparrows under the right conditions.
---
The only way to outrun a warlock is to get hit by a Cabal shield bash.
---
Oh damn, I'll start getting them from Xur, boost my Warlock. Thanks man

Everybody here trying to stand for their point whether for themselves or for the community it depends on their own opinion and expression.

At least I don't harm anyones feelings in a bad way which is the most important thing for me, otherwise I don't care if I get downvoted for a small comment.
---
Valor is the investment rank - the more you play, the higher you go. Wins help you reach max rank faster. 
---
If you are looking for a (more or less) skill based crucible rank, then this is glory.

I can confirm it has dropped with a shader. But I was forging a powerful frame along side it.

I'm throwing a grenade at a group of people, it explodes or does whatever that specific grenade does. Enemies just move.

No problem mate, that's how this game is most enjoyable :D

I've also never seen that and I'm going on what I've seen.

I'll be mobility 7 and be jumping away from a titan who's just skating after me

The Telesto can easily be countered. But instead of learning this, let‚Äôs make a post, have a cry and get it nerfed. Hence cry babies. Bet there‚Äôs thousands of you sat at home just waiting to cry about something new. Boo hoo sad face. 
---
A tripmine is almost always a OHK I‚Äôd try that out and as for the melee I thought you meant more of the knives or smoke or special punch. Whenever I melee somebody (I haven‚Äôt checked the numbers or anything so I can‚Äôt give like any really reason) it seems the same as my titan and warlock so I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. 
---
Midnight Coup from the Leviathan Raid

Meanwhile I'm getting Warlock Bonds like they get paid by how many they give away.

They should wait and see if the division 2 will be successful with epic, then follow in their footsteps or just continue on the independent route

Jotunn only drops from powerful frames but do the frames in beguzia so you have a better chance
---
Only the powerful frames. So you get two shots per week.
---
Yeah i have tryed it once in ib but it felt kind of unfair, it is quite op. But fun to try. And great some times doing hard solo stuff. Anyway it's getting nerfed in PvP so I guess that's Good.  Have a nice day. 
---
I posted a screenshot yesterday here of me getting 2 of these after one 150k NF.  One of them was the curated roll.

Per character.

Oh wow, didn‚Äôt know this. No wonder I don‚Äôt feel much difference. How long it last, like 1-2 secs?

Thanks buddy.

How to intercept space messages: Airpods
---
That mini dungeon coul actually replace the floating anus but the lack of comms in solo queue would restrict the mechanics a lot
---
There are a lot of armor from Y1 that look awesome but sadly don't have perks or slots for mods. Bungie should update them.
---
You're not invisible as sentinel but you get to block incoming damage from afar with a deployed shield and you get to toss said shield around the room. Whereas SB lacks mobility and is vulnerable until you make your way to slash the target in cqc (provided that you don't get team shotgunned or suppressed by a sentinel grenade). Ursa requires you to block and block drains super much like gwisin requires you to go invisible AFTER a kill and going invisible drains super charge. It's not necessarily counter productive because you get rewarded for protecting yourself making your way to the enemy. Plus you have improved speed while guarding.
---
Lol it happened to me multiple times in the same nission
---
Yes, because one thing we've seen is that people want Gambit games to take longer.  Also, the idea of completely removing you from Gambit to play a mode that has nothing to do with Gambit is quite silly.
---
I meet a suppressor grenade on my SB every other game. 
---
You lack something ‚Ä¶.
---
Are those the Kairos functions arms?

The bottom half is the y1 ever verse armor

Not really a god roll but a decent roll indeed

Sorry you‚Äôre not allowed to play the game. You need to get me a feeding frenzy kill clip roll now.

What will you give your "buddy" in return?

Better without pvp? Have you heard of...

*just not playing it?*
---
True, 2 runs of a lost sector are probably faster tho
---
Now good luck finding a half decent cloak.   
---
I'm still stuck with last seasons Iron Banner one since all of the rest look/colour awful. :( 
---
just wish the npc's realized that too
---
Bungie never releases full and detailed patchnotes in order to avoid shit storms where they can. Ever thought about it that way? Guess not, you maybe should return to their forums instead of Reddit to let your salt flow freely.

Get the Destiny companion app of mobile or Destiny LFG. You can normally find a Sherpa that will help get you through it

I‚Äôll correct the title:

I don‚Äôt have a family so I blew the last five years worth of savings I‚Äôve had from my poor paying job and bought all of these, give me upvotes.
---
Only problem with that is the Ophidia Spathe exotic. I can already throw knives pretty much infinitely. If they had one-shot ability too, it‚Äôd be broken as fuck. At least with the charge you can only get one kill, and you have to potentially put yourself in harms way to do it. The knives on the other hand, can be thrown accurately far as fuck. 
---
The Phalanx curse is spreading
---
Yeah for sure, I was trying to figure out which sector was fastest yesterday and kept running into a bunch that only gave two. In the future I‚Äôll probably be sticking with the one on the bottom part of Mars when this story mission is unavailable lol
---
Again...  no....  you're so much closer on Mars... He's easy af to kill. 
---
You need to fast travel further away on DC so I don't see your point 
---
dude you don't need to fast travel on dc since the exit is right next to the entrance
---
Mars probably has the fastest ones yea
---
Rampage is cool for lower tier mobs, but it‚Äôs not doing shit for boss fights.

Telesto and Wavesplitter getting nerfed so that Jotunn can rise.. nothing tilts me more than watching a projectile turn 90 degrees and kill me

It's like a modern day furby
---
Something along this lines would be fun, but straight up ffa would never end as nobody would be able to deposit motes. Maybe something like this :
---
FFA, but the map is a little larger to add some level of separation. Maybe 6 enemy zones with 2 active at any given time. You have to actually kill enemies to enable a timed buff which allows you to both pick up motes, and also makes you immune to guardian fire. The buff expires after a short amount of time of not killing anything. This would at least somewhat limit players just collecting motes that other guardians generate, or just camping at a mote bank. There should be more than one mote bank as well. Adding more variables like zones and mote banks will add separation to players so not everyone is clustered in one area. Haven‚Äôt quite figured out the individual boss mechanic yet. Maybe once you reach the max motes a door opens, and it is a short but challenging sparrow Ride to an arena where an different boss spawns for each player that reaches max motes. At this point you can kill other guardians which heals their boss. Guardians sparrows are inaccessible unless they reach the mote limit, to prevent them from just going to the arena and killing everybody. It would be a longer match, but a one round thing whereas gambit can be 3 rounds. 
---
Jotunn barely tracks at angles if someone is running across your screen when you fire it sooo miss and cause a little AOE. It only is good vs people slowly strafing 
---
Try r/fireteams or join a clan.Make sure to be straightforward in your posts, if it's your first time doing the raid or what role you want to play.I am sure you will find a group that will help you through it
---
Considering how many Primevils I've melted im gonna go ahead and say yeah you're wrong. 
---
Banner shields subclass has greater ad clear potential to get you to primeval quicker,  then you can rallycade banner shield and shotgun the boss to death,  punch lunging to stay grounded through quakes. 
---
I've done enough gambit to earn 7 resets to know what I'm talking about. Shotgun strat via wells or banner shield always works. 
---
me when i finally get breakneck and bygones
---
They don't release full notes. But the **do** say when they're going to change exotics. Only salt I'm seeing here is from you, son. Guess you've had your ass handed to you by OEM Titans to many times, eh?
---
If you don't clear all the enemies,  doesn't the lost sector not reset? Fast Travel works as a hard reset
---
I use the one at the bottom checkpoint of mars... run down, climb up the rock wall with high jump or similar, super the boss...
---
Run it again, use heavy ammo on the boss and your done... less than 5 mins total for 2 runs.
---
Well... I was just trying to further the discussion.  That's all.

---
Well Nova Warp is just completely unbalanced so I agree there but try killing somebody else in their super whilst using Spectral Blade. It's not easy. 
---
But hunters are getting nerfed and so are Warlocks whereas Titans aren't. 
---
The way I see it if blade barrage is going to be getting a nerf where our own knife explosion can kill us if we're close then Hammer of Sol should get the exact same nerf, if you throw a hammer and it explodes right next to you then you should take damage. If that's already a thing then it's not exactly noticeable.
---
Not homo-erotic enough. Before someone blasts me, not making a judgement, just sayin. Watching Jojo is like watching an aging Japanese man come to terms with his sexuality over the years.

It would be absolutely awesome if the ghost could give you quest instructions based on your account/character progress.

I got it on my very first :3
---
Mars north lost sector. After acquiring, first get kills by heading in the lost sector and headshotting everything till the boss. Keep precision killing till you pass the mark and need to collect seeds. Kill the lost sector boss for 10 x seeds, fast travel to north point, head back into the lost sector skipping everything and kill the boss for 10 more seeds. - I am fairly certain its faster than this method, and always works no matter the rotation.
---
Thunderlord brought a third serious competitor for exotic heavy, at least on console since it can get more consistent damage than whisper. But I still want to able to use primaries and specials without feeling like a drag to my team in dps
---
It can kind of do this for clan progress. The only thing that actually works. It used to also let you ask for your next powerful milestone to do, but that's only ever a button away.
---
Only potential use was saving a gearset for raids, strikes and pvp. It could equip them by command at any time, without you needing to grab your phone for the app. It was actually nice. 
---
My go to will always be Memory of Cayde. Which actually looks great with the Copper and Blood shader (makes it a dark crimson/grey color). I just have to use the whole set for a rare bounty and hate it. Lol
---
Ugh I'm so jealous omg.

All I need is the ghost and I have been having a hard time getting through my last reset. I just was so burnt out on Gambit and was tired of losing to stupid stuff.

Standing in front of the lost sector chest, turn 90 degrees to the left. You will see the door open when you open the chest.
---
I see and concede to your point. In a perfect D2 world it would be as such. It is very unfortunate how players are derided for not knowing what to do, especially in raids. The worst of it being that they simply leave. 
---
My idea was to reinforce th OPs thoughts on there not being enough in game help players so that there wouldnt have to as much if any Google use. Goes for raids too. I apologize if I came off as rude, my intent wasnt to be that way. Saw the comments about how there shouldnt be much hand holding by the game...even though a majority of said players probably Google where to find everything in the Dreaming City. Got too flustered.

Can you let his dad, Xur Sr. know at least?

CoO had a better story. The story was ok, the content was not. At least Osiris warns you and explains some of the infinite forest while Warmind was just random bullshit. It melts my brain when i just have to think about the strikes, even the reused strikes in CoO had a legit reason to exist. Warmind strikes make no sense.

If you hear them swooshing their blades behind you...it's already too late.
---
Strength in light, Guardian
---
Reminds me so much of the gauss cannon on the gauss hog from all those years ago in halo.
---
Finished the quest a few hours ago, happy shooting guardian. 
---
Nice shot tho
---
TAKEN RISE UP
---
Is that a fucking roomba?
---
this is my first 650 character
---
so? I'm still gonna draw it, just cause it already exists doesn't mean I'm not allowed to.
---
I miss dinklebot. Was right at the height of GoT too. Well, at least we got Dinklage in Infinity War. 
---
Edit:
---
this is my first 650 character 
---
Haha, sorry, Titan main here. Didn't really run a Hunter (or warlock) till D2. I still think it's one of the best looking cloaks in this game (for now obvious reasons...lol). 
---
Ohhhhh. Okay. Well
---
It should be easier since you got one with 3 650 weapons now. 
---
If it makes you happy and is effective for you..... go for it.  I masterworked and infused a machina dei to 650 because I  like it and it works for me.
---
Here's my breakdown as somebody who has out significant time into all 3:
---
Warlocks and Hunters simply have a higher skill ceiling than Titans. This is due to the way their jump works, requiring either better control or how it's less forgiving, respectively. The hunter loadouts require a lot of dexterity in terms of gunplay interwoven with your other skills, but it's not about managing cooldown as much as the warlock.
---
The warlock is a very ability-oriented class and is about getting creative. You have the most vertical challenging ability of any class. Between your rift and variety of ways to use your grenades or long range melee, you would excel in versatility. However, the skill ceiling is insanely high because not only do you need to micromanage your cooldown to be the most effective, mastering midair gunplay is an absolute must with the type of jump you have. This is true moreso than either of the other two classes. If you're using blink, then your spatial awareness needs to be on a whole new level. Warlocks in general are difficult to master, but highly rewarding and capable of handling more at once than other classes I've found. 
---
Being very, very blunt: Titans are absolute easy mode. I am not even going to take exotics like OEM into account, or how absolutely broken skating is. Shoulder charging is effective and requires a significant amount of map knowledge, but it isn't exactly difficult to do once you have that experience. It is also highly forgiving since you can 180 change direction upon activation. Sentinel in crucible is also rather mindless, similar to Nova Warp for the Warlocks in that it is a "chasing" super. Same goes for Striker. Hammers can be used from further distance, and I find to be more effective. The loadout for strikers and sentinels I find encourages bad habits, chasing only being one of them. This is different than being aggressive, this is behavior like following a single target across an entire map into enemy spawn, or challenging corners you shouldn't be. Ultimately, I find Titans both boring and cause my general PvP skill level to quickly deteriorate. 
---
This is NOT to say Titans are unskilled players. They still require gunplay and lots of coordination. The reason I personally find them inferior is that they tend to be 2-trick ponies between shoulder charging and shotgun aping. It's hard to blame the players, because at the end of the day it is the Titans kit that lends to this. I personally find Titans inferior not because of the results they output, but because they rely less on a players skill. If you took a warlock main and a Titan main with equal gunlay skill and map knowledge and put both onto a hunter, it's much more likely the warlock main would win due to having developed better PvP habits and general skill in terms of adaptability to any situation. 
---
This is just my two cents. I have over 200 hours on each class between both D1 and D2, about equal in everything except a little less time on hunters in D2 and a little less on warlocks in D1.
---
Lol. But I do feel like the longer u can ads some with the dot crosshair before the shot fires the better the tracking.
---
Back to where you came!
---
any you can recommend? 
---
I just really enjoy using it tbh. I primarily use it in Crucible, so tend to prefer the faster reload. I can't remember if I've tested it with hcal and outlaw on its own though.
---
Warlock transdimensional fist bump!
---
Warlock is life.
---
Outlaw overrides flared magwell
---
Oooh, gotcha, thanks.
---
The only thing I personally like about Bygones is it feels similar to GLance. But I get why you like it.
---
Unfortunately, no. I think the faction shirts are available in places, but, most of these are Dev/launch team shirts.
---
Warlock main since day 1 D1. 
---
When i finished the quest i killed 3 guardians in one invade. First 1, then 2, then 3 ressed 1 so i killed both and got the quest complete. So yes.
---
That's how I felt and then got it on me second Gambit match with the sleeper simulant. Just keep invading, good luck. 
---
First off, things won't change for the rest of y2 most likely, besides there just starting their transition. Second quit with the this games dead bs. Its never gonna die, and the new games coming out won't kill it.
---
Came here to say this.
---
I'll probably add the other 2 decals soon. Just wanted to start with warlock cuz void walker for life lol
---
NSFW tag because this is filth
---
Please don't tell me you are an SOA fan...don't think I don't see that name of yours.
---
&gt;But they fractured the playerbase, causing imbalanced matches and lag.
---
No idea what that's based on... lol you are trying to say they fractured the player base by adding a Lone Wolf playlist? ***Hold on.*** You are also trying to claim that the Lone Wolf playlist "failed". You can't have both. One implies the playlist was popular, the other implies it wasn't. So which is it? Also, and you even said it yourself here, the matchmaking is what causes lag, not the game mode. Stop pinning the word lag to the LW playlist when other playlists had the same issue. In fact, the entirety of D1 PvP had major lag issues. It's like saying you wanna ban coka cola because of sugar content but then pushing Pepsi, Irn Bru and Fanta as drinks that are okay.
---
And gotta say, I don't really care if CoD or Overwatch don't have solo playlists. I don't play those games, so i don't even know if they have the same 6-man-stack steamroller issue as D2. I can't comment. But I do know Destiny used to have a Lone Wolf playlist and I loved it. I never had all these issues that you seem to be pinning to LW. None at all, like I said before I remember it being better than standard clash.
---
&gt;And this is exactly what they did before, and it still failed. Destiny does not have the focus on PvP to make it possible.
---
Source? Because Lone Wolf was on rotation until they stopped doing content for D1. And I never had issues with it. I have no idea how you can claim it failed? Do you have the numbers in front of you? Do you have videos of you waiting any longer for a match than any other game mode? I never had any problems, like I keep saying. Worth pointing out, they haven't added Lone Wolf since D1, so there has ***never*** been a case where LW was 1 out of 3 playlists. D1 had way more playlists at once, even by the end of year 3. So the division of the player base then was greater.
---
&gt;Not even a super mega popular game like Overwatch can pull it off. You really think Destiny, with as of right now having 15% of players in PvP, can do it. But Overwatch, with 100% of its massive playerbase, can't?
---
Have you considered that destiny plays completely differently? The clan system. The bounty system. The many puzzles and exotics that require a team to complete. The raids. ***Almost everything in destiny pushes players to join fireteams.*** This creates an environment where a solo player can't complete 3 QP games without running into at least 2 stacked teams. My point is, there is an actual NEED for a solo playlist in Destiny. Overwatch, CoD, BF don't need solo queues. So stop comparing Destiny's needs to the needs of games that play completely differently and incentivises players differently. I do play plenty of BF actually, which has numerous dedicated servers you can choose to join. The maps are also so big that a single player does not impact too much on the outcome of the match. I last played CoD MW2, again I remember it not needing a solo queue, getting stomped by coordinated teams wasn't all that common. Overwatch, no idea, I assume it doesn't need a solo queue.
---
&lt;There's not. Decades of online multiplayer have taught me that much, there's not enough demand.
---
How many games have you played that compare to Destiny over these decades? Considering the first major online FPS, out across all platforms, was CoD 4 way back in like 2006.  That would make it, at most, a single decade. And that's giving you the benefit of the doubt and assuming you actually work in the industry and know for a fact, with numbers, that it has *never* worked. 
---
&gt;I think you have a massive misconception of people in teams... Not everyone is super sweaty 4 stack with Not Forgottens. A lot of the time it's just a few dudes kicking back some beers and bullshitting. I've never played seriously in a group, we're always just fucking around and using silly loadouts.
---
Get your ass on the comp playlist right now, sir. Play 3 games. Then come back to me and say a lot of teams just mess about. And guess what happens? When these sweaty teams finish getting NF they start jumping into QP and rinsing all the solo players. I have no misconception ***at all.*** (Spoken intensely but not aggressively btw, it's just from my experience teams are rarely not sweaty, even IGN have commented on this, r.e. Fireteam chat)
---
&gt;And of course the game mode effects the lag... With a tiny player count, the matchmaking can't do its job. Just look at Competitive. It has about 2% of the playerbase. Are you going to tell me it's working fine?
---
The game mode does not affect lag. You said it yourself there, the "matchmaking can't do its job." The matchmaking causes lag. But again, you are contradicting yourself. If LW splits the population too much, then surely the MM has enough players to work properly. If the MM doesn't work properly due to low player count, then to say its splitting the player count too much can't possibly be true. One of those arguments are valid. 
---
Like I said before, I never had these issues. I found D1 in general had these issues across the board during low player times. This "tiny player count" you speak of was not a problem associated specifically with Lone Wolf.
---
And comp matchmakes differently to QP so that's an unfair comparison. But you are right, comp doesn't work, it's a mess full of sweaty teams. Lag, however, is not an issue I have found in comp. Just the sweaty stacked teams.
---
&gt;It's not that I don't want solo only playlists, it's the reality that it won't work.
---
It will work, it worked before.
---
I moderate this sub fairly regularly. I see every single post that comes through here just about. And believe it or not, bitching about sweaty stacks, players wanting a solo queue and complaining about how messy pvp is in general right now is quite a common post. I can see the demand for a solo queue. I also, as a mostly solo player, want a solo queue. I, like many other Lone Wolves, enjoyed LW playlist back in D1. 
---
And lets just say Bungie added LW, what's the worst that could happen? I can't see why anyone would be super opposed to just trying it out, especially when Bungie keep trying to make real failures like Breakthrough work. There is no risk in giving solo players a game mode, that runs for 1 TINY week every now and then, which is dedicated to them.
---
***And I'll finish this essay (lol) by saying bungie have never once said it failed in D1.*** They have only ever said it would negatively split the population in D2. Which, in my opinion, would mean they anticipate a solo queue to be popular enough that it would damage the normal QP wait times. A la, the LW playlist would not fail, it would affect load times of other game modes. And that's going from what bungie themselves have said on the matter.
---
Yep, but for that one day you can get radiant seeds for free :) Fortunately enough I only have one day per week in which I do forges.

Thanks!

I got the same case a year ago when i decided to build a new pc, remember to buy additional fans for all of the fan slots since the built-in one is kind of weak ( blue led ones look sick there).
---
Thats a badass pc there anyway
---
I know what you wrote but it not really worth an exotic slot for the couple of kills it might get you. 
---
There is definitely a lack of good PvP exotics for the Titan. Situational or Super boosting exotics have nothing on exotics that are going to better gun play or neutral game. 
---
 Chatterwhite maybe? 
---
I am. what are you going to do? roast me for the thing I like and you don't?

It‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôs honest work.

All of those and waiting on Like a Diamond to be fixed for Blacksmith. You've basically done less witj your time by pointlessly pouring hours into raids

Fragile ego,  overcompensating I take it? You're really acting hard over a game? You're clearly disliked for being an egotistical dickwad as your profile shows.

What a big boy!!! Epic gamer!! I do raids scrub xD

Sad life mate. Pathetic,  sad life.

I won't entertain you with replies but I'll actually enjoy my life without being a shit person

I really didn't mind dinklebot. I don't think I have a preference, but I wouldn't have minded if he continued playing the part. 
---
There are a few animated shaders from BA, and one from DC. Hopefully they've got more in the works for the future. And I agree, an animated Taken shader would be *amazing*
---
First you say it's not worth an exotic slot for a few kills, then you say there's lack of exotics. Logic?
---
&gt; There is definitely a lack of good PvP exotics for the Titan. Situational or Super boosting exotics have nothing on exotics that are going to better gun play or neutral game. 
---
[Definitely](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/ah1xwf/are_you_ready_for_the_crucible_guardian/eecsk27/)

It really does, except for the UI. I had to change the screen bounds to ever see my ammo or radar lol. However, as a result, emblems look really screwy.
---
Too soon...
---
Your attitude is ass but that doesn't stop you from commenting now does it
---
That would be a bit of the love I'm talking about, but any *help* would be appreciated.
---
Getting a sweet looking set and having it be options of mobility or health recovery with nothing else... not even worth holding on to that ='/
---
If you look up Xur on the App Store app you can get ads but reliable and lets you rate the exotics everyone is being little bitch on there because he won‚Äôt give shards of galanor 
---
I'm on console and as far as I'm concerned, your character is saved to the console internal storage. That means that you could- well, if ur on console, go to gamestop and buy legendary edition for 35$ usd.
---
use the code, refund the old disk. otherwise idk.
---
Yes I've been saying this for so long. I'd love more active shaders 
---
It seems to happen when you use the sparrow emotes
---
NO! 
---
They have ruined such a masterpiece of a cloak, I demand retribution for such a heinous crime.
---
If only there was a website specifically for this if you typed that exact phrase into a popular search engine.
---
Oh well. 
---
Is it possible to Titan Skate without risking a ban? Not a PC player here, I've been led to believe it requires 3rd party software or something.
---
Yeah that would be cool. I feel like bungee thinks that ornaments are exotic shaders. 
---
The dog's thinking: "Mouhahaha! Fear me humans for I'm pretty much your average height now!"
---
Just normal things. 
---
activate windows ma dude 
---
hmu if u need at .bat file that can activate for free
---
Because I use OEM, Synthceps or Dunemarchers. Getting an extra kill or two doesn‚Äôt out weigh increasing your gun play or neutral game. 
---
Just because something is better than nothing doesn‚Äôt make it good. Also I don‚Äôt like the Striker subclass in Crucible. It‚Äôs a good panic button but that‚Äôs about it. Hammers are a better roaming super and Sentinel is best because of the suppression grenades even though the melee aspect of the super has terrible hit detection and is really weak against other supers. 
---
While there are a couple of options Titans have a weak pool of Crucible exotics.

The best advice I have for getting cores is to buy 2 from Spider every day that you play, no matter if you plan on using them right then or not. I only play 2-3 days per week for 2-3 hrs at a time to do the daily/weekly activities, so I get 4-6 cores per week just from visiting Spider. That's 16-24 per month, which can infuse 5-8 items. Between that, random cores from breaking down legendaries, scrapper bounties I happen to complete, you can stack up quite a bit of them. 
---
Also, don't infuse anything until you're getting 650 gear. Aside from Black Armory exclusive activities, everything in the game is easily doable at 600, so you don't need 600+ to get by. It took me about a month to get my single character to 650. All my guns and armor that I use are 650 and I have 6-7 items in each slot. I didnt have to look like a hobo until I got there. I held on to my highest gear in my inventory, but I used all my old 600 gear in activities. 
---
Hahaha, pay to win!
---
I'm impressed that the game kept you inside the map and not thrown out of it's own dimension.
---
Was talking about the companion app...d
---
Yea, something weird is going on today. I had a wizard take up 3/4 of my screen stretched out as he moved around.

I sure will

That is really nice

I work in the AV industry and my company has a number of talented people that help us create custom designs for all types of applications. In this case my buddy custom printed these decals. It's not one "sticker" per say, but multiple that are applied at once and then the clear film that holds them during application is removed. I was super impressed when I saw them for the first time. He's going to make a couple more for me when I send him my ideas. 
---
This happened to me several times on Tuesday. I was doing a titan missle and the Phalanx did a shield blast that negated my missle and sent me WAY off the map. Same map though - buggy? 
---
Fusion rifles are an energy based weapon, it‚Äôs impossible for them to be kinetic. I see what you mean but the idea of it seems odd and I‚Äôm out on that basis alone. 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs magic in space but shit still needs to make some sense.
---
Not sure how it would work since fusion rifles use a better of energy, don't know how that would relate over to a kinetic weapon shooting bullets? 
---
not at my pc and about to go to sleep so i‚Äôll pm u sometime tmr
---
it sounds dodgy af but it works xd
---
People have said it a lot that they'd like to see a railgun or something for a kinetic fusion rifle. I think it would be nice to have 1 or 2 available for the slot.
---
Cool play! I'd give you an upvote had you not said, "It's not much,"
---
can you explain your statement? obviously the cost of game development has been covered - much more than that...  
---
i am happy for people to make even good profits with good games using fair pricing... you know consumer oriented like in industries where you have proper competition...  
---
please dont confuse greed with whats needed to cover costs and make some profit..
---
It is an expansion to the current game.  Any option you buy, even one that contains the base game, will just continue the story on the character's you already have.  Buy the one that is best for you.  You can buy just the basic Destiny 2: Forsaken for $40 and it includes the Curse of Osiris and Warmind expansions.  It does not include the base game (which you already have) or the annual pass.  If you want the annual pass to get Black Armory and future DLCs till spring 2019 you can purchase it separately for another $35.00.  If you want to go for both in one just get the Destiny 2: Forsaken + Annual pass for $70.00 and save $5.00.  The legendary collection is $60.00 and does nto include the annual pass, so you are wasting money (about $20) if you buy that one.
---
I haven't even reached the light level to do the first forge.
---
You can pick up another copy of the base game for $5-10 at a GameStop.

He steals people's design and sells on his website. So, print quality will be garbage. He also manipulates karma to fool people.
---
Well at least the Orpheus Rigs is a better roll the the one i currently have.
---
What in the heck lol. Also that's the straightest tether shot I've ever seen, almost every one I've shot has some weird curve to it.
---
I mean... that‚Äôs probably the most common use. 
---
I get a lot of enjoyment using it every time I capture a point in Iron Banner. 
---
1080 or 4k ?  Also the word is the nvidia ray tracing cards are slower for old rendering than the 10xx generation. 
---
1080 for the resolution. Ah ok well if those cards are slower then that would make sense 
---
Anybody else read "Mr Anderson" in Agent Smiths' voice, or just me?

Maybe not destiny. Play some smash brothers. Or hearthstone. Those are my back ups atm
---
Did you not know about nova warp? It‚Äôs literally a roaming, repeatable thundercrash that hits through walls.
---
I agree! I was with a friend and was listening to music and chilling. It helps more when you‚Äôre relaxed and you don‚Äôt even think about getting the kills. But then you end up getting them and you‚Äôre like, oh shit I finished it 
---
If it's completed, no. It will stay until you click to turn it in. 
---
If it's not completed before its expiration date it will go away. 
---
Also: visit Banshee-44 and cash in gunsmith materials, which will give legendary gear and shaders. Good luck!
---
I was playing against a Titan today that was using it and the only time I ever died to it was when I was crouch shooting haha. I easily jumped over it and slid to the side and avoided it. It's not overpowered. 
---
I‚Äôm a hunter main and I can confirm... this is true
---
What shotgun is that?
---
Good luck man, heavily prioritize killing the blue guys to build up that time and give you a chance, that way when people spawn in and catch up with you they got plenty of balls they can grab.
---
Izanagi's 1 shots through overshield with x4, you definitely did not have x4.
---
If you don't have all year one exotics you should buy the engram every week 
---
It really doesn't tho.
---
Dust rock blues?
---
Well-places tether friend 
---
Pick up borderlands 2 way better 
---
I do agree. I also use Gwisin vest specifically for Spectral blades. As a hunter main, I understand the frustration encountering other people using spectral blades in Pvp, it lasts so long especially paired with the correct exotics. Even without gwisin it always seems like you get killed by the same super twice: Dies, respawns...dies again. 
---
Its rate but can be hilarious when it does happen. 
---
Esp if they didn‚Äôt know they have a chat mate ;). 
---
Some of the crap i have heard

‚ÄúHits bong hard - door opens. Are you smoking in my house again?  No of course not - you are!  Lets share!‚Äù  Xxxxx has left the match.

Get gud scrub

There are functions built into the game  to take screenshots, you should try it some time.
---
You can avoid this easily by simply strafing, doesnt need nerfing at all
---
Not much? You wanna friend me so we can play together, Mr Not Much? Could use an invader with your modest skill.

But then how would I show off my awesome water bottle?

But thanks, I‚Äôll look it up.
---
yea screw you sir
---
Thanks!
---
Destiny 2 is like star wars but for cool people. Star wars sucks. 
---
Its so nice to just Nova Warp, then when the enemy panics and send Power weapon rockets or swords, whatever, i just warp through them, and kill the Panickers.
---
Go commit thinking emoji until brain explode.
---
Counterbalance 
---
Na, i think telesto is a nice tool for fieldcontrol and some alternative builds, but some kills are too much random at all ^^ 
---
This will be the new go-to if Queensbreaker ever gets nerfed. 
---
This is just destony all over.
---
1 class ha an op exotic that is so OP it's ridiculous.
---
Other 2 classes moan and moan and moan because *they* don't have their own op exotic
---
Its like my mate cries on discord "oh my fuckin god, there is a telesto shot at me ... BOOM"
---
OEM requires some skill to use but with skate abusing being a thing, they should either remove/adjust skating or give a crushing nerf to OEM just like they did with Wormhusk back when all titans whined about that one. Good times.
---
You're probably facing the same level 20's in IB as you are in comp.

They are. On the 29th.

UGH, that's the one scout I hate!
