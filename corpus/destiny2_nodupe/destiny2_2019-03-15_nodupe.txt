Good lord.  I want it.  I botched doing the quest for it and missed out.  I was sad when i realized it was gone

---
---
Check Amazon cause they're always selling it cheap 
---
And also sharex.
---
Forgot about tractor cannon, you’re right
---
That doesn't mean he murdered them
---
I can.see.this being true if one of the perks on the OEM was singer's server maintenance
---
It’s such a pain in the ass sometimes especially when I’m playing crucible and I change my special but it takes to long to where I already spawned in and lost my special ammo 
---
No, he did not directly kill them, but be brought guaranteed death to them all for no reason
---
Sounds interesting. I don't mind Countdown in it's current form for comp. Although it would be cool to throw in neutral bomb in the quickplay playlist as a "warm up" for comp
---
Go to the spider he has it
---
I know how you feel with the timegate. Unless bungie changes how truth to power works, I'll get chronicler 2 weeks too late to get the IRL badge.
---
Lol
---
No joke...  love my malfeasance. 
---
0 mobility titan is still faster
---
I hip fired in air, hit a **single** shot and got marked. 
---
**excuse me**
---
It could be his lines to another player that you're just listening in on. I know I get that a lot after our team kills an enemy invader, we get their voice line telling me "your teammates back, blah blah blah" 
---
B. Whenever I launch a slova bomb it always goes right past them
---
Some good stuff i gave you a like
---
Same 
---
Deletes your account too
---
At least TLW would only take like a couple of games to complete, with Thorn I’m literally getting 5% per game
---
I reckon it's because he knew everything ahead of time because he's shifty and only releases pertinent information to the rest of the guardians. When he found out Ana Bray was trying to figure out Rasputin stuff, he just went directly to where you meet him because he already knew everything Ana was trying to figure out. 
---
With my hunter sometimes I run a last word, vow, and lucky pants 
---
You must be fun at partys :D
---
Keep it up!
---
with razor blades, king size.
---
The same. I was terrified whenever I gotta face the Ace cause it hit like a truck. But now I'm just blast it away because the Ikelos HC have a higher fire rate and I was hitting all of my shots. Still terrified whenever I gotta go against Luna or the Thorn itself. 2 tapping HCs are scary.

 That’s what you get for being a snitch

No problem

Is the service revolver that good?
---
What’s not Dope is how stomped I got that game 
---
Does this make all other ghosts obsolete?
---
Yeah like its still.....pretty good
---
Coil should be chaotic evil
---
Sorry, didn't know, but there's a Cammycakes video on with a built for that exotic. I think it should help
---
There’s basically a way for party leader to block all ips except for bungos so that they cannot find parties. But do not do this. It’s called cheating
---
or booping them into a wall with your sparrow. sometimes they die from being squished, sometimes they die from bouncing off the wall and hitting something else. either way i laugh way harder than i should
---
Ah. Gambit prime is my favourite planet.
---
Your going insane. Maybe this subreddit is just a figment if your imagination
---
just did some testing myself and this it seems rather pointless to use. PVE its completley coutclassed by every other exotic and PVP there are better exotics to use. I think its more of a fun to use item since its realy weak. The buff is only for 2s and the regeneration doesnt work .
---
You were Burning from the Warlock melee. That's why the heal was interrupted.
---
If people noticed that's the same crap in the Mindbenders throne world. You can see it when the lighting flashes. They're huge though
---
Oh
---
i did some more testing the healing is realy weak + it shouldnt be stoped since one eyed mask heal reg works while beeing shot
---
Well thanks but I'm having some serious dejavu of this situation but I'm very sure that I've seen those plants before 
---
Aunor is one of Ikora’s spies so uhhh yeah
---
Hope you sided with the Vanguard...Ikora's giving them to Vanguard chooses weekly starting next update. And by them I mean 1. You get one a week. Still better than Drifter loot, though.
---
spider&gt;simseeds for shards&gt;vance turn ins for gear/shards/shaders&gt;dismantle gear/shaders for more shards/cores&gt;profit&gt;repeat.

 I cant wait for tomorrow

Except it's one microtransaction that many players would be happy to purchase. 
---
I got mine today to how do u like it
---
I shit my pants just watching this
---
I've been unintentionally hoarding Finest Matterweave without knowing what it did. Last week I found out what it does, and fond that I have a stockpile of around 30 of them.
---
I didn't try it yet but i'm about to 
---
Sided with Vanguard. Get an extra enhancement core each week starting next update, worth more than the synths and infamy Drifter gives you.
---
aim smoothing =/= aim assist. aim smoothing adds acceleration to your mouse when it moves faster, moving the cursor more than you intended. it's quite bad to have on.
---
No I need to stay here with you to make sure the devs aren't being bullied
---
Powerful engrams can be exotics. Nice find.
---
I have read that you should turn the daily bounties in en masse (a lot a once) and it ups the chance of getting one of the rare bounties. Seems to work for me. I've gotten 4 of them so far.
---
The recluse is a sweet ass smg
---
Drifter has power surge bounties to get you up to 640 now.
---
Ah the classic D1 passtime 
---
Quick question, would I go faster with Mida multi tool and mini tool equipped, or with a sidearm?
---
If you acquired the gun on a different character than the one on which you deleted it, you should still be able to pull from collections from the character you acquired it on. 
---
It guarantees an enhancement core drop from an orange or yellow health enemy. Once consumed it stays active until one drops.
---
I was reading the title while listening to a song and the song said okay okay okay. Lol what are the chances.
---
I laughed, then realized I am the shit teammate. 
---
I died seeing Joe Biden on this! Haha
---
I think theres a couple of problems with gambit/ gambit prime right now. Like odd things like voice lines and the battle feed.
---
  It straight up told me I lost seven motes while I was still alive carrying them. And how our invader was returning after just killing theirs.
---
 Probably interference from all those taken tachyons or what have you
---
I wish there were bonuses for having certain levels of mobility, resilience, and recovery like the new armor perks.
---
lmfao this is gold
---
Play he game a lot maybe make a altar to rngesus do powerful milestones
---
If you run and slide at them it goes faster
---
Not at all. And don’t let our silly “best class” contest bother you any. Everyone wants their class to be best. If you enjoy hunter, then stick to it. I do think trying all the characters is a lot of fun if you have enough time to play them.
---
There is no reason to feel guilty about picking any class. We are all guardians and that’s what really matters. 
---
(PS Warlock mains are the best :P)
---
No, but they have ranged melees
---
No this happened, i believe it was season 2 ep 21 ‘the lost mariner’
---
I sure hope that’s the case! I hated that I missed it but I for sure seen the patch notes stating xur would have forsaken exotics now so maybe I’ll get lucky and he will have it one day for me. 
---
Love this. Iver and over ha ha ha . and im a Titan
---
Ah yep, I actually just read where it’s part of the loot pool now so fingers crossed!
---
If you claimed it in November, you should still be able to play it. Install the Battle.net app on your machine, and login with the user you used to claim it. You should see Destiny 2 available to play on the bottom-left of the main screen, under “Activision.”
---
Which do exactly three damage
---
"Eats Snacc"
---
*Thank you, it was DELIGHTFUL*
---
Hmmm... that kind of seems like a stretch to me.  My reading is that Xur used to deal with Ahamkara on behalf of the nine.  ...which must have been some hilarious conversations.
---
What does he say?
---
Im not choosing sides then
---
Thanks
---
The more you make the more satisfied I am Knowing somebody can actually write/type stories
---
Google.
---
Oh ok thx 
---
Do you play PS4?
---
I let myself get hit by suppressors sometimes in crucible. It makes titans cocky and rush you. It makes them predictable.
---
I upvoted because the word asinine is just fantastic. 
---
Power isnt really what im worried about, i know how good hunters are. Im more worried about the thought of “do people see me as a bad player for picking hunter?”
---
Ive yet to try it. Hows it feel?
---
Why would you care about that? I could say titans are face roll or that warloclks are op because of space magic. Each class has its strengths and weaknesses. Play what feels good to play after all you'll be the person playing it. To me hunters are best for gunfight s. If you like killing stuff with guns go hunter. If your more of an ability kills kind of person go else where because hunters don't really have the best nades or melees. There's a reason a lot of people like hand cannons and a lot of people play hunters and that reason is fun.
---
Or you could just give him a condensed version of the answer. You do know how conversations work, right?
---
Same. It's my go-to exotic for fun in pvp. 
---
https://youtu.be/SUl3oq6JDeA
---
I literally just got this today. Still haven't tried it out yet. What subclass do you use?
---
It’s really nice when you run it with top tree arc strider. 
---
Not sure what either of those are
---
Definitely gonna get the invader jersey, the are gorgeous
---
Using an arc melee or being hit my an enemies melee let’s you do a counter melee that does a ton of damage and heals you.
---
I have played Warlock in PvP for a decent amount of time, also my mate with a 3.5kd who plays Warlock a good amount never really made that good of a use of Nova Bomb. It's really not that great against good players, they know how to dodge it. Only viable in quick play, but fuck it... 25 year old PvE players who play with 50fps downvoting my statement lmao.
---
Top tree arc strider
---
So it does one shot in crucible! I’ve been wondering if it did. I rarely touch crucible, so I was too afraid to even attempt it
---
It does 300 dmg in pvp. So it will on shot any guardian not in a super 
---
I already own forsaken, i'm talking about annual pass. The black forge thing if i remember correctly
---
This needs more upvotes. 
---
I agree. A lot of the randoms I get seem to focus solely on killing trash and stealing motes or afking next to the invasion portal. I tend to be the only one killing elites or blockers. If I bother to tell them why we're losing, they respond with vapid scoreboard references.
---
i don’t think bungie would do that (unfortunately), but i think the new chair emote after killing an invader in gambit suffices 
---
Did my breakneck with a Misfit.
---
Suffering
---
Yeah armory was fun if you're into pve, and so far joker's wild is a damn good time.
---
Voice chat 
---
I did mine with hazard but the ringing nail is baller too with good rolls.
---
Shin gave me the last word tho
---
Where do I sign up?
---
i’d day it would be a good time to jump into the annual pass, especially since we’ll have access to the third tier of Reckoning so we’ll technically have access to all of the new Joker’s Wild content, + you still have the entirety of the black armory to play through, including some of the most polarizing PvE and PvP weapons and some cool ass exotics ties to the forges
---
Because of people like the praxic order deeming him a heretic. He wants to imbue guardians with the darkness. Fight fire with fire. He doesn’t tell anyone his plan because many people have been exiled from the tower fir his kind of thinking. He keeps his cards close to his chest out of necessity. If he told people “hey I wanna create dark guardians.” The vanguard would without a doubt exile him or worse. He’s playing a dangerous game after all.
---
i think the wildwood mark from the EDZ would fit better, but i like it overall
---
my 1# atm is the ringing nail with dragonfly/rampage 
---
That makes sense actually. Still don't think he should expect anyone to trust him though.
---
not the feels I ordered but I'll take it
---
They let countless guardians die at the battle of mare imbrium. Lord Shaxx wanted to further study the hive before going to war with them on the moon, but the vanguard didn’t listen. Crota emerged from the hellmouth and hundreds of guardians were slain because of the vanguard.
---
Next week 
---
That's when I run in circles on the conveyor belt in Prime. Can't hit me when I run faster than your bullets, ha gottem
---
But I cant voice chat the game... I’m grinding this forge ship and god damn... and I cant middle finger the bungie when it puts me into a game with 15 seconds left and no other guardians. I feel it would help with my frustration.
---
Teammate of mine the other night was wrecking people with thorn. He said it is a great gun. I’m still trying to eat it myself. 
---
Best thing is Code of the Missile Titan melee into a group of them
---
I mean, Redrix Broadsword is also a pretty decent \*Scout Rifle\* for PvP...
---
Are you on PC, PS or Xbox?
---
Missed the point again
---
A friend of mine got banned yesterday after he quit 2 matches. Well, to be honest, he got kicked by bungies awesome servers, and then he got a penalty for that. 
---
Same. I finally got Phoenix Protocol during a forge ignition, and The Queenbreaker dropped for me two nights ago after not getting ANY new exotics for abt 2 or 3 months (not including quest exotics).
---
i’m guessing there wasn’t much of a point to be made then
---
Ha. Maybe. I just want it for PvE anyway. If I don’t ever get it (which I’ve come to the acceptance of), no worries.
---
I can't say I've had the same experience honestly I've only done solo que and I reset the other day
---
The moment you pulled out the Coil and saw everyone was about to respawn, all I could think was just "oh...oh no..."
---
I have just joined the clan. Looking forward to doing some raids for once!
---
This is a fashion set, not a function set. They look too good.

---
Wait, you get to beat Ghaul again?
---
What? The cabal guy?
---
When you join in on a buddies “ good team “ and you play the supportive tether hunter / invader who get at least 3 kills per invasion and watch you’re buddies “ good team “ run around like the damn 3 stooges and lose because “ I didn’t get enough kills...”
---
Lunas, actually
---
Fun stuff, never realized that handcannon had literally the same exact model, lol. The ending was great.
---
Long Caster, is that you?

Nice grind.

What perks does the Bite have? Is it the one which was sold by Lord Salamadin?
---
Oops, did you like that no one died to it?
---
But who can fly ;)
---
Hell yeah dude, it's so much fun to use and on top of that it's really good. You can even use it to kill bosses if you time your melee right after they stomp you, it's hilarious.
---
How about that move where you bang your fist together? It’s the funny FU. 
---
Thorn was actually pretty easy just make sure you have a fireteam of 3 for the strike. Also it doesn’t have to be a void hand cannon. If you get more kills with a different one then use that one. Also make sure you play comp.
---
Firstly its git gud. You need to be salty and toxic. (Thats what every legend rank person is these days) and then Use dust rock blues, trust or some other sweaty handcannon and wardcliff coil also you have to be hunter so you can use gwisin vest and/or shards of galanor. Spectre blades and blade barrage respectively.
---
Titans are not taaaaanks. Titans don't have an inherent durability advantage over the other classes. They have a wall of 'The boss doesn't gib me.' If anything, they're old school, Season 2/3 bruisers from League of Legends. Meaty, sure but plenty of damage output.
---
I love Calus Selected on that GL
---
Invisi-titan strikes again. Probably 2-eyed mask to be honest.
---
Finally settle on masterworking some stuff, blow all my cores, and the power cap increases. Wish masterworking worked more like Catalysts for Legendary gear. I know I can farm on Mercury but that's boring af.
---
Is this a guiding light shell? 
---
It's honestly in a really great place right now. I played like 10-15 games of Gambit last season and got super burned out in that short time, but it's probably my favorite thing to do now with recent changes and improved matchmaking. Prime is different but loads of fun.
---
I've also found that going in and working for something like Breakneck makes the gameplay more fun because I'm focused *less* on winning or losing and more on just getting the kills and matches played. Having a goal beyond just winning is really helpful.
---
The Destiny PvP meta has always been fluctuating and changing between different wepons and wepon types. Early in D2's life it was all pulse rifle and auto rifles but then there was slowly a hand cannon meta eveolving until now(were i love playing pvp) you have a varied meta were you have a lot of different types of hand cannons and sniper rifles than can be used and mastered to a whole new extent. 
---
I have multiple times gotten melted by the other wepons like smg's and auto rifles in todays meta, they just take some extra time to get good with and master to an extent to vere you can compete with todays meta. You can just look towards the PvP pinical wepon of this season since it is a smg that absolute melts and is insane.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
There are 3 good reasons for that
---
1. Being a titan
---
2. Being a titan
---
3. Being a titan 
---
Yeah i think thats what im gonna need to do moving forward. I just converted to Warlock main as Titans werent doing it for me any more. 
---
After playing D1 as a titan, and playing 200+ hours as a titan in D2, I just can’t get used to the jumping of a warlock haha. I dread jumping puzzles. 
---
I think you get it when you dismantle an experimental weapon liked the dead man walking from forges
---
they need to add the option to go into first person when your in a super 
---
I am on Xbox if you are still keen for a run
---
The shader is on all the refurbished year one weapons like Hoosegow and Bad News. Think it comes from those. 
---
What are warlocks one hit kills?
---
Yeah I know dead man walking was the only one I had in mind
---
***Better devils Impostor.***
---
For once I side with Zavala. 
---
I thank you. Even Shaxx doesn't expect the ending :)
---
If you look closely, those pixels form an image.
---
Feeding frenzy/kill clip is better than feeding frenzy/rampage..change my mind
---
I love the animation for it too. You just shank them with it.
---
This, this almost made me throw-up.
---
dont mind me asking but what are your settings?
---
I've legit not actually hit a titan but somehow killing me still gives them the overshield 
---
Fair enough
---
Coincidence like that reminds me of when the bus in front of the one I was on turned on its indicators and the beat matched perfectly and didn't drop off with the blinking
---
Probably zavala since he's a Titan
---
Is there an up to date site that tracks DPS? All the guides I find online are from the Forsaken launch
---
But I feel your pain, I'm crawling through Comp.  Dont hate it, just keep trying to get better.
---
I'm up to 16 exotic engrams! so close! can't wait for my new shiny Gjallahorn
---
Yep, since the weekend. Quite a few exotics(Pheonix Protocol, getaway artist,..) and the risk runner catalyst
---
Well....no not really &gt;:
---
It comes with a boost to get you to forsaken content as well
---
That's one of the first non-BA shaders I've seen that manages to not look garbage on a BA weapon, gj
---
If anyone has done that, it's the Drifter

You forgot about being a Titan

I run it at high settings and have only had maybe 4 frame drops in quite a lot more hours than I care to admit 
---
A fireteam which speed runs Lake of Shadows and all of them use the Vanguard Boons should be the current fastest method to get Tokens
---
Hunters have an entire super that's supposed to shut down supers...there are TWO EXOTIC weapons (Tractor and Two-Tailed) that can shut down supers...and yet suppressor grenades are better and regen 
---
All good mate do you want specifics?
---
Forsaken is fantastic and most people would recommend. It will keep you busy for many hours. There are still people playing though pc does have a smaller population that consoles. 
---
The annual pass won’t end until the end of August. We don’t know what comes after that yet but I highly doubt it would be D3. I would guess the earliest it could come would be November though I would guess 2020 release. Take that with a grain of salt though. All guessing. 
---
I wish! What I was saying was imagine. Imagine if destiny realised how to weave its bits and pieces together to make 1 amazing looter shooter where expansions and end game content stay relevant to eachother.
---
Try looking in the first direction, then turn again. If he's not there, turn again. If he's still not there, bingo you got him. 
---
I mean I didn't know what it was because glorious PC gaming master race.  I assumed it was something from D1, for the same reason.

Me: *Sees name of post* “You intrigue me”

---
Me: 😱😱😱
---
Destiny 2 is terribly optimised what are you talking about....
---
Hey,  its double underscores on each sidd
---
yeah I have a gaming laptop and need to find some decent setting for it 
---
I tried that as well, gonna have to try a tractor cannon like the other guy suggested. 
---
Its true. You let yourself get hit, they will rush you even if they have no shields because they assume you panic.
---
# EXPLOSIONS!!!! 
---
I was pleasantly surprised when I got the buff from field I started doing 99999 dmg... *twice, with each single grenade*
---
Shaxx already won. 
---
I‘m happy we can do these quests in pvp. thorn for example can be grinded much faster in pvp than in pve and there is a pve option in 3 required quests

Remember when we had a milestones tab? Those days were so simple...

I appreciate an overwatch reference but I mean Ana Bae aka the most useless guardian who watches us get wrecked on level 7 of ep all day from her window and doesn't do anything. Hell, she's probably drinking tea or dabbing on us while having a laugh with Rasputin.

Yea, but I kind of understand why they did away with it.

There's just so many weeklies/dailies. It wouldn't "look right" if they kept it in that format.

Outrageous fortune, vanguard season 3

Do warlocks have any exotic OP like that? Asking for a friend..

don't forget that this thing fires as fast as some hand cannons...

yeah need the field prep for reserves

As a titan main, I'd say I survive 75% of cursed thrall and skreeb punches, AS LONG AS THEY ARE ALONE. More than one and I'm a goner. Still worth it, just don't survive.

Asher Mir: better medicaid for amputees, prohibition on radiolaria, promises there won’t be Cabal ever again 
---
Bruh that ain’t your first 700
---
Depends on which tree is used.  Easy to dodge slowva, other one a lot harder to dodge because it moves just slightly faster
---
it doesn't. the insane dmg comes from hard launch and spike nades, which both increase impact dmg.
---
I'd go with one with spike nade for better ammo efficiency, but do keep try to get an aggressive one with spike. it's not that rare from my experience
---
Valid point, which is why i like how they did the first few thorn steps. You CAN do em pve but pvp is more effective, and then the crucible handcannon/void step came and all my hopes were shot down. Especially since i was looking forward to using it 
---
obiviously yes, ask you self if you're viable to use it.
---
I feel that on an emotional level... i had a family before they came.
---
Nah he looked at him menacingly and the Titan took offense to that  
---
Y
---
Oh boo hoo you have to try now 
---
I have a box breathing tataras. Without box breathing it did roughly 30,000. Box breathing added anther 30,000. And boss spec added another 30,000. So I was doing around 90,000 dmg against the boss at the end of the thorn quest.
---
The PC players at least 😂
---
Mr. Torgue approved.
---
Sounds like something a bad player would say 🤔 jokes bro 
---
Absolutely. You may want Sniper Reserve perks though. 
---
Serious, but take it whichever way you wish.
---
I'm not there best.
---
I did not know this, thanks
---
Oh I’m sure it’s not rare I’m 100% sure I’ve sharped what would be considered a god roll outrageous fortune with other good perks too just because GLs were kinda meh and proximity grenades were the top perk I was looking for. 
---
Yeah
---
What is it about crucible that prevents you from doing it?
---
I got MT when it was the thing last season and it sucked. Now its dominating even in Gambit. I argue that it was buffed tremendously. 
---
Void is the default element on it. Unless you have one still sitting around from before Forsaken with a different element, they come in void. 
---
And yes, it’s so popular because it’s the only 180 rpm hand cannon with void for the thorn quest. Once that calms down, it’s use will drop back off the map. 
---
box breathing adds 60% precision damage and boss spec adds 5% or so...
---
also that's a bit random for this post
---
I am not there best.
---
Rumble is the best for me, all the other you get sweat dogs 😂
---
And telesto in you down time. I feel bad for the EP bosses at this point. 
---
No problem. If you don’t have it already, good luck getting your hands on Jotunn. Thing is amazing and lots of fun. Has become my go to exotic knocking the exotic heavies off of my general play. 
---
I've still got a stash of ether seeds around here somewhere.
---
I encountered a bug where seeds of light were not dropping (Tried from all sources, my lock will never have chaos reach if bungo doesnt add other ways to obtain them) and posted it on the bungie support page once a week for three weeks. Every single time i saw bungie tech support answering the posts before and after mine FOR THREE WEEKS.
---
I just gave up its a game after all
---
Stress, i have a medical condition (stress triggered epileptical seizures, which could possibly kill me) and id like to be alive to play this game xD
---
They're talking about last word recoil
---
You are the laggy fucker with public wifi... these ppl should burn in hell
---
There was no betrayal in siding with the drifter. Ikora and Zavala both know and help the drifter and &gt;!the Shadows of Yor.!&lt; in their goals. 
---
They have to keep it on low profile, but it's not a betrayal in any way, shape or form. Aunor wanted do investigate even after Ikora told her to stand back and that they need the drifter? Fine, she's free to do so, but that doesn't mean that those on the opposite side are traitors, because they were working with the leaders of the vanguard all the time. Its not an amicable relationship, but it's still a partnership. 
---
That’s a real shame them. Maybe they should add a pve alternative that’s slot harder/long, so that people have an alternative but most will still use crucible.
---
Same here with a range masterwork
---
No your not a bad player for picking hunter, just be prepared for people to call you out because apparently hunters are “OP” and need to be nerfed
---
Was actually using a hotspot buddy
---
Have you read the latest thorn lore? 
---
Yes
---
Which is what i suggested in the post, even if it takes twice or even ten times as long id still gladly do it
---
I did think that was the case, thanks for confirming it 
---
As a sniper and avid hand cannon user, I like to be able to shit on supers and big groups of enemies as though I’m cutting through butter
---
For the Average players, it is. I'm for sure above average, but its obvious i shouldnt be getting 35-50 kills every game since the valor and glory systems do not work 
---
Also how do you have hunter next to your name? 
---
Aunor sent us a dead ghost and threatened us, too.
---
Those people are probably the worst recruiters I've ever seem, tbh. Maybe a few classes on conflict control and anger management would help them. 
---
Thanks!
---
And thanks again for the information 
---
I wasn’t aware of that 
---
r/lostredditors
---
I good way to do that would be stop giving it money.
---
Please shop a ghost into Aku Aku from Crash Bandicoot. The internet will thank you.
---
thats amazing hahahahahahaha!!
---
Or just hunter bad lol
---
I kind of want one for each leg.
---
Just imagine the confusion.
---
Seriously. Can anyone provide some tips on easy ways to stockpile them? I do the scrapper bounties when I can and I recently discovered that the Spider’s kill bounties give them, but some of the bounties require just sitting in an area and waiting. I’m absolute trash in PVE so anything involving that is pretty much out. 
---
Click the "COMMUNITY OPTIONS" over on the right side banner. It's called flair, and you can make it say whatever you want.
---
can some body explain?
---
Thanks 
---
Huckleberry is super fun. Rampage and a never ending magazine on an SMG makes for fun times. Also happy cake day stranger!
---
I think you meant to say Golden Trace. But it's okay fellow Hunter, I forgive you. lol
---
MEEEDELEEEEMOWWWWWWWW!!!
---
At 1080p? I had a 960m laptop until recently, and i had to play on low settings to maybe get 60fps at 1080p. 
---
So...Forge carries this weekend? LOL
---
What language is that? Lol 
---
^ I agree with you. It’s just a smidge better for pvp 
---
It's not curated-you can still masterwork weapons, it just costs more now. It's right by the mod slot.
---
It’s hard to get better then everyone is just shitting on me
---
German my friend. 
---
You probably have a little oem just for your dick！
---
OH fuckinduh my bad
---
Is it a possibility people who are not major PvP players are going into comp to get weapons that require comp and lowering the general level of skilled players?
---
The top picture is a actual thorn in real life 
---
Here you go bud: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3163447
---
I feel like that didn’t do much for prime at all.  My 4 stack team has been going up against solo queues 80% of the time.  I hope it gets changed soon, it’s not fun to go up against a 4 stack that knows what they’re doing.
---
Over 15 powerful no curated no jotun cue the violin for me 😂
---
Same thing happened to me on Tuesday
---
TRENCH BARREL TO THE GROUND 
---
True. I wish there was a hold-to-continue-to-buy option, or a bulk-purchase option. It’s not entirely that I’m lazy (I am), but frequently I have a limited amount of time to actually play. 
---
No.
---
I have no idea what this mean but it sounds pretty amazing.
---
Yup, up this week
---
😴
---
Pluz
---
He's in a grey area. He neither likes nor dislikes my dad
---
Damn. I feel bad you got the Thorn. You'll never use it since you got the Braytech RWP MK II right after!
---
Lol me and my team used an all void load out including tractor cannon (we all have the catalyst btw) and we were just melting nightfall bosses it’s so much fun! Lol 
---
I'm in the same boat, and my interpretation was that they're changing it so stacks fight stacks more often, which seems beneficial to both solos and stacks.  (If you're a stack that enjoys a fair fight that is.)
---
I have one with spike but now hard launch. Does that actually effect the DPS?
---
This is what ultimately did the trick for my team as well. ...also we comboed Well and Tethers which helped MASSIVELY.
---
How exactly is GL and rocket lajncher damage determined? I used to think blast radius was the modifier to damage, but since I heard it wasn't, I am left thinking they all do the same base damage?
---
🤤🤤
---
go kill fallen and they have a chance of dropping a thing to start the gofannon quest. after gofannon you kill vex for the quest
---
For the second and third one just kill Fallen and Vex on Nessus.
---
I use Adobe Premiere Pro.
---
Honestly, after the buff, Wardcliff outclasses it at pretty much everything.
---
Just do both, one on a different character lol like in my Titan (since I use one eyed mask a lot and the shaders i use make my Titan look like an assassin) I chose drifter and on my warlock, I chose the vanguard cuz well my warlock looks like a more nerdier version of ikora lol and well as for my hunter? I let my girlfriend decide that so yea, tonight is when she finally makes her decision, I’ll probably update this whenever she decides lol 
---
Ah thank you :)
---
We need necrochasm back so even when we aren’t punching cursed thralls we can feel like we are.
---
The game may as well be called Hand Cannon 2.
---
Competitive from 0-1500 isn’t hard at all. The odd rough match but generally a piece f piss. After that it gets harder 
---
Sometimes the bank registers your hand in with sound and visual, but never banks the motes. I had a game where I had to turn in 8x in a row for the game to finally register the hand-in.
---
It made me laugh so hard tho, just thinking that someone can be this stupid hahah
---
Bungie, Pulses and Scouts plz
---
I mean, it does literally say that it's Outrageous. Name definitely checks out.
---
Did you sent the whole shipment back to fenchurch?
---
Mine did the same thing last night, god bless LFG.
---
I'm pretty good, managed to work my way to top 5% on a couple of game modes a few months back.
---
What killed it for me was the constant stacked teams I'd play, usually most of them would be carrying pinnacle weapons.
---
I can sweat through a team game and win. But I don't want to be stressed out for a majority of games I play. That's it.
---
Now all the hardcore comp players have Lunas howl or NF, which holds a 0.67s ttk. And now the recluse has a ttk under 0.5s. Any other primary can't get a ttk under 0.8s unless using buffs, in fact, most weapons can't get under a 0.9s ttk. 
---
"Get a team, use Ace of Spades!"
---
Nah thanks, I have reasons for playing solo. And Ace still can't compete with NF or Luna within the mid range at 0.87s ttk. And guess what? Nearly every map in d2 supports mid-range play.
---
"Oh why don't you grind for Luna and NF?"
---
Because I have a full time job. And doing it solo is more grindy than anything I've ever played in Destiny - in short, it just isn't fun. I play games to have fun.
---
D2's pvp design is massively flawed. It needs overhauled. It needs better matchmaking. Bigger maps for 6v6 bar the few that are already big enough. Nf or Luna need a small nerf or we need other options to compete with their ttk in mid-range. We need a solo queue. We need better spawning. We need a gamemode for hardcore players to flex so QP playlist isn't plagued by try hards. (Trials) We need the fun game mods like Rift and Combined Arms to come back into rotation. Some supers need nerfed. Some supers need buffed (poor nova warp, how shit it has become because Bungie can't balance a super properly).
---
And to all the team players who are gonna say "Destiny is a team game you blueberry!"
---
To you I say: a massive chunk of your active player base plays solo. If Bungie does not support solo players then they will start dropping out with all the epic SP games coming this year that don't alienate solo players. And when that happens, you can look forward to very long queue times and far more sweaty matches.   We supported you when the endgame and team activities were lacklustre, the least you could do is support a massive chunk of your community by voicing our concerns.
---
TC + Nova Bomb helped me to solo du incaru as well yesterday Poggers
---
So jealous, I started with Warlock and I still can't get Chromatic Fire to drop. It's my last one.
---
Fuck you
---
I’m on whatever side Shaxx is on
---
I feel so left out when everyone talks about how OP it was in D1 since I never played it lol.
---
F
---
"Oh ho ho! Look what you have!"
---
Does everyone in the strike team need the quest ?
---
I’ll try it anyways lol
---
if you on PS4 i could use a new active clan my PSN is Burd\_UP
---
dare I ask who/what is "Jojo"?
---
I’ve come to feel that Destiny suffers from a bad case of “Tell, Don’t Show”.  Really interesting things constantly come up in the lore or story, but they have so little overt effect on the gameplay that they go underappreciated (such as the Vex having successfully found a future where they eliminate the Traveler and the Darkness).
---
Just finished it last night with Well of Radiance Warlock an Orpheus Hunter and Celestial Hunter. Have Orpheus on add control with celestial taking out the knights and shrieker.
---
I have ff &amp; kc. I have also have outlaw rampage with stability masterwork. The latter is my preferred.
---
This image hurts me 
---
-quote me sweaty with 500 hours since forsaken launch with 9 collection badges and a crippling ego
---
Only acceptable in gp 
---
Currently at 600ish points I have my Luna and I’d say I’m already a decent player but for some reason I cant break 1000 points
---
Rumble is my favorite, too. I wish it counted for the Pinnacle weapon stuff.
---
Man, that gray/white one looks slick AF, famalam
---
Karl Marx?
---
It is advantageous to wait until the Primeval is damaged. However I can understand people who see the advantage of setting the opposing  team back a few minutes, especially if they're just doing bounties or going for Triumphs. 
---
Honest question: i've seen it a lot but why do people call the primeval prime evil?
---
These are all things that pave content has. Just admit that people such in the crucible and let’s move on 
---
The edit alone is downvote worthy 
---
Outrageous fortune with spike Grenada’s? 
---
The mod is very important though, it gives more damage which is good
---
Dual wielding skill. 
---
As long as you belive it he can be it. 
---
What level are you?
---
humanity just peaked
---
I find it to be a lot more fun when you play with a team (2-6 stack), but soloing in general and getting stomped by the dude with the meta for 5 minutes straight isn't fun no matter how you spin it :(
---
Strafe speed can be very high as a Hunter
---
Wait, that’s illegal 
---
I think drifter sounds better than VAGABUND but might be because i'm used to vagabund and not drifter. 
---
Ya initially when I got it, I couldn't aim for shit. It would always bounce of in distance but completing the catalysts (almost 200 bounties) with it made the aiming thing better
---
Me at 1:15am talking to my friends who have been bouncing between playing siege and Minecraft for the past 6 hours as I get closer to getting the thorn
---
that boss dies from one jotunn shot 
---
Probably 
---
This game, no joke, has started to induce panic attacks for me because of the adrenaline rushes.
---
The game is far too high-octane for me, I can see myself moving on if I can't play without having the risk of a panic attack.
---
Note: these attacks are entirely physical, has nothing to do with my mental health. It's literally all the adrenaline that causes it.
---
very toit
---
Crucible is the easiest game mode: Queue. Load. Die repeatedly, without moving sometimes. Match summary. Orbit. Repeat.
---
Sometimes I questioned if I ever landed a shot. How many things can you complete without killing anything in this game?
---
I didn't know her name. My bad. I got the hammerhead last night. Now working on getting other guns. 
---
Hey bud, my friend doesn't play anymore! I'll shoot him a message for when he wakes up, should be right to do so! I'll DM you if he's cool with it!
---
I ran my warlock when I got back, boosted my Titan and played my hunter up, managed to get them all up to power cap (600-&gt;650) in the two seasons I played in (outlaw and forge) right now hunter is 670 and everyone is trailing behind, I play a lot but realistically recently I’ve been only Doing timed stuff cause I play other games and destiny has objectives  which is way better than me playing rounds of the same gamemode on a different game
---
Did you try DestinyLFG? EVERYONE is trying to find a group for the Thorn strike.
---
Use the companion app bud
---
What do you play on? 
---
Post removed.
---
This lies in a gray area of racism. More culture-ism thus it breaks the rules. Please bare this in mind for future posts. 
---
My bad homie, will do that now 
---
May I ask why you were watching car crash compilations?
---
Not to sound mean, but it's just ignorance I think. I don't believe a large number of the players know the word primeval, and so when they hear it they assume it's describing the prime evil (like main evil).
---
Are any of these items MUST haves for their specific class?
---
Yes we have known that this would happen for months. Since the annual pass road map came out
---
Sorry Xbox 
---
I'm in a fairly active clan if you're on pc
---
I'm not one of those people, but I'm betting it's people hunting the triumph where you have to kill enemy guardians while they are using their super. 
---
Idk why but when I was little I had a nickelodeon channel or something in german. The point is drifter sounds almost like those German happy meals in early 2000s
---
Its not difficult it's just annoying to always go against Lunas howl and not forgotten which straight up have a higher ttk than anything else and are given to people that are already better than most, increasing the skill gap
---
Preach it, brother
---
Omg that’s insane... why would anyone use that?? 
---
*frantically searching for mine in the reserves*
---
Huh.  Never seen that b4
---
orpheus rig is a must if your a hunter
---
His purr is not his own.
---
And I'm well aware that Ikora was ready, Ikora being the only little reason I had hope in the Vanguard.
---
I haven’t played destiny 2 in a while I have the season pass thing and I was just wondering is thorn hard to get??
---
You're probably right but i mean kt's written on bounties, the screen as a buff in primeval slayer and even in subtitles, if you turn them on. This isn't crucible, how can anybody miss so many times? (Yea i know, non-english speakers)
---
Some of us watch the cinematic as well, buddy.
---
Yeah I was thinking that, I think it’s probably because I’m actually okay at rumble 😂
---
Thanks so much for your help! Hopefully he's okay with it!
---
r/woooosh
---
Yeah I got outlaw and rampage on my blast furnace. Thing melts people
---
I picked up a masterworks outrageous fortune once but the perks aren't nearly as good as yours. :(
---
I would say Orpheus Rig if you don't have it already. I've heard Chromatic Fire is fun, but it's the one Warlock Exotic I've been missing so I don't know myself.
---
My strategy has just been to try to fill out my collection so that I have increased chance of receiving the exotics I haven't gotten, especially if you're still hunting Year1 stuff and buying the Fated Engram. You don't want to skip Wormgod Caress and then get one from the Engram and have wasted 74 Legendary Shards.
---
Righttttttt
---
I’ve actually been meaning to join an active clan, are there any other requirements?
---
Tether, well, and Ursa titan was the key for us. It was still a nightmare though. 
---
You're probably right about ESL people, but also younger players not paying attention.
---
Feels bad man
---
Can you link it? 
---
No just to be active with weekly raids and again be active but besides that that’s it.
---
Uhhh lol, I'd rewatch the cutscene again. Pretty hard to miss what they gave him.
---
Yeah! Another amazing piece by WildeThang!!!!
---
On top of what everyone else says, i like hallowfire heart chestplate for hammers. I hardly use the super anyway, and i love having tons of thermite grenades and shoulder charges 
---
Boredom
---
Hey, just another tip for ya. You seem to be commenting on your post rather than replying to the comments from other players. Make sure to hit the reply button that is below their comment, and not the one between your post and the comments section.
---
Good luck!
---
I would agree with this. I usually top leaderboard in qp and I never used drb lunas wardcliff. I did have blast furnace tho so call me a sweat if u want. Hardly ever touch comp tho but with this new season my friends and I had played some comp (for thorn) and we all kinda had a realization. COMP is better than QP, change my mind. Lunas is easier to get than we ever thought, we are going to work towards that this season. People talk comp up to be scary and toxic. But really I get matched in more fun matches with different loadouts in comp than I do in qp. Crucible definitely needs an overhaul or bug QoL update at least but that's for any game type in crucible comp or not. Aside from QoL tho comp is arguably just more fun and better matches (usually) than qp. Even queuing as solo or 2 stack is good, compared to qp that is. As a whole crucible hasn't been in a good place for awhile tho.
---
Doomfang essential for that double shield tree!
---
I maybe late on this, but i just completed it and I'm now hella hyped
---
Weirdness is the key thing aaaalll the die hard crucible bros floss over.  P2P networking on the crucible matches means that if you have a great internet connection and everyone else has less, you get fucked in the ass and constantly shot behind walls etc.
---
Its always cabal
---
Nope
---
Makes sense
---
Yeah I think they need to stop that, I am not a fan of specific content.  Especially making me go back and get an exotic I already got... TWICE in D1 with a worse step for void kills in pvp, when you have unleashed Jotunn, single shot snipers, and the pvp premo hc's.
---
I'm so glad I've been saving them all . I was waiting for this moment
---
Ok, I'm an idiot
---
I got the quest, and it tells me to enter "Mystery and Potential" via the Gambit Director
---
I open the gambit director, and regular gambit, prime, and rendezvous is there, and nothing else. 
---
What am I missing here??
---
Rule 13. 
---
Yea probably
---
Just Spectral Blades everyone and everything
---
I used telesto for a lot before buff, especially in gambit and on warlock. Its always been a good gun.
---
Tip: Rule 13. 
---
...taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out and break their grip on Freehold.
---
I think you mean Th3Jez
---
There's no reason to use it over another quicker sniper rifle. It's clunkier and unnecessary 
---
Claws of the Wolf? I know others haven't been as big of a fan, but that thing shreds enemies.
---
I’ve got a similar roll, but mine has maxed out range and it’s damn good
---
I enjoyed the valentines 2v2 mode with a clan mate, we could hold our own &amp; do pretty well, normal crucible - I just get stomped all over the place &amp; it's not much fun at all - prime example is I played 3 matches last night for the Thorn quest &amp; managed a grand total of 5% towards the quest.
---
I wouldn't class myself as being bad, but I don't discount that possibility.
---
I’ve just straight up stopped using guns in general and go around punching people. It’s not very effective, but it sure as hell fun. 
---
Someone please explain me how does the grenade launcher and rocket launcher damage is measured. I thought blast radius was the equivalent, so I always assumed that the vanguard's and iron banner grenade launcher were garbage
---
Oh, I love that one, actually.
---
That is a good one. Gotta get those mod slots though.
---
this. i live, they all die.
---
The darn things are practically glued on.
---
Well the avg. k/d is exactly 1.00, so there’s that..
---
So far with the melee kill streak maxed out, I have not failed to 1 shot any orange bar enemy, even with shields. It's addictive..
---
I just need to test the gauntlets + devour class abilities + paragon mods (recharge class abilities when you use class abilities) so I can pretty much always have devour
---
I hear you I'm still working on last word and thorn and I dont really play crucible much and I've been everywhere from top of the leaderboard to the bottom while doing this
---
for u?
---
I only take them off for Geomags and the Skull when I’m using Void/Arc, but when I’m using Well I love them 
---
This is where I progressed the most. Rumble with Ikelos HC and Last Word. Plus you don’t have teammates stealing your kills since assists don’t count. 
---
What’re they called? It’s something I need to add to my evening prayers 
---
First the lost sector boss is very weak
---
the boss had a solar shield and spike granates. But the buff is really overdone. 
---
good design would have spawned them in and kept the strike going, no real sense in causing it to end with no reward other than poor/lazy programming. 
---
I have that same grande launcher, with those same rolls. 
---
how would you find out that you couldn't kill them doing it? the quest should come with a warning, otherwise how else would you know that would happen unless you tried?
---
Fiddy bucks 
---
Winter's Guile, my man! Found em
---
Actually the GOAT. Appreciate you 
---
especially when youre trying to get thorn, and you keep getting killed by it
---
Im a firm believer that once you have PvP rolls on weapons you like your enjoyment in Crucible goes through the roof! Season 3 I had 30 glory points and had cursed off crucible, but here I am now with Lunas and Redrix having more fun than I could imagine
---
I just wish it didn't sound like a water gun..  lol
---
aggressive frame &gt; adaptive frame
---
spike grenades add more damage
---
hard launch adds a little more
---
Agreed.
---
I find Crucible to be insanely easy. I'm middle of the road at COD and I'm consistently at the top of Crucible.
---
I’m an idiot. I read this shit about a dozen times going “what’s the difference.” I spent 4 whole minutes of my life re reading and trying to unlock this damn posts secrets.. 
---
Happy slapping, fellow warlock. I pray to rngesus with you
---
titan simulator 2019. Heres to it 
---
Or....This may sound crazy but...we bring back glass needles
---
Wait until you have to play the Chasm of Scream unless you have a good fireteam.  
---
But is there any way I can measure this stat? Because all I can see is blast radius a.k.a. area of effect
---
Honestly Will never be even Close to nf/lunas, THE thing with lunas/nf is that it can 3 tap without being needed to first get a kill and then play super aggresive, trust can 3 tap with rampage, belive ikelos can aswell so really not something special
---
Should Have Been Full Aeon Cult Exotics and Merciless on there.
---
I assumed they brought forsaken exotics to the fated pool. Would have been nice.
---
Synthoceps intensifies.
---
Ew, this post reeks of Titan
---
😒
---
It's kinda the same for me. I like mayhem, i like showdown, i play iron banner....but idk i rather want to play some PvE after a few matches.
---
It lacks variety imo. Every map is the same and modes are just clash (dearhmatch) basically.
---
___________
---
For a game that uses mechanics in strikes and raids, it surely lacks some of that in PvP. Imagine a game of rift where you can pass the ball/spark to your team mates...
---
Ya know, the quest this time around is not nearly as difficult I don't think.
---
I was able to get the first pvp step done in one match. Bungie did the right thing by only requiring a small amount and granting 3 mats per each guardian-class kill.
---
It can be done and I believe in you as well guardians. 
---
When your team mate jumps into prime from normal gambit and is first to bank with 5 motes...seconds later its all drained. :-(. 
---
Just click on their heads ez
---
What planetary materials can't you buy from him is it just the boughs
---
I hid there when both my teammates died with a shotgun. I was so scared we were so close to finally beating it and I just hear the thrall coming and started shooting. Guy messaged me after we beat it said he was laughing watching me hide.
---
Lol sorry I only have a phone right now and don't want to type a million questions 
---
Non-lore reason to say no: death could be incredibly loosely described as simulated sleep, but not stimulated sleep (since it's not actually sleep).
---
I'm garbage at pvp, and put off doing the quest because of it. When I finally decided to go for it, I finished that step at the end of an afternoon of crucible. Hell I've actually improved quite a bit because of that quest. 
---
so an inverse relation between the blast radius and the spike bonus damage?
---
The joke is the drifter wants golden gun *control* not freedom, because he doesn't want shin to burn him to a crisp.
---
they've had it for a while (got it in the izanami forge when bergussia wasn't released) and they also have 17k kills on it so i'd wager they've had it for a while
---
Blame bungie. 
---
Personally I don't play anything but rumble or iron banner even though bungie keeps trying to entice me into that windowless, comp van with candy. 
---
Damn it seems you are right, I wonder why I wasn't seeing it then.
---
There is one moment I remember very clearly where I was capping a point in control, killed 2 guys and saw a third coming while I was one hit from death. Knew my only chance was headshots and I hit two but he killed me before I hit the third and I watched his health tick down to like 20% and then it stopped. Maybe soul devourer stops when you die?
---
Will Xur ever stop selling those hunter legs? Find out next time on dragon ball Z
---
I think its fair that its combined pvp and pve, Imagine being a pvp only player and being forced to play pve for a Quest exotic, i dont hear pvp players crying
---
Oh. Well never mind!! Lol 😂 idk which ever one lets me keep all my guns n shit, I’ll go for them lol I didn’t read it right dude I was like half asleep lol

It's not about being or appearing smart, it's about being social with like-minded people. Besides, he did look it up but it was confusing so he was asking for clarification from someone with more experience. 
---
no need to be rude, yes it can be hard some times, but when you find your favorite weapon its a blast to play.
---
Says the guy with a 0.73 overall... lol
---
And because of your simple mistake, you get downvoted. Reddit is strange.

Dammit ehoar!!!

Satou shader. It can also drop with it.
---
When you main, dream, live and breathe as a titan you only ever think about one thing and that is, how hard can I punch this thing in front of me. 
---
Invader w. Golden gun running at you? 
---
You get your sweet ass in there and molly whop him 3x times.
---
Swarm of screebs? Punch one right in the face and enjoy the fire works.
---
Oryx planning to wipe out your light? Punch. His. Goddamned. Face.
---
Tess mouthing off about fenchurch after a shitty bright engram? Do I even have to say it?
---
I got downvoted? Eh. Idc tbh i just come to Reddit to rant lol 
---
Equinox. Scout rifles are potent in many maps, especially 150s. The problem I find with long sightlines maps that dont have objectives (clash on equinox or vostok) is that it encourages very campy play styles. 
---
Equinox for example. Get to mid, stay mid and shoot people with scouts as they jump up. Get heavy everytime, because it's in mid, and wait until time expires. It's boring. Sure good teams can make pushes and use shorter weapons, but most qp teams dont. 
---
Vostok, endless vale, convergence, both murcury maps (blanking on names), dead cliffs, and actually most maps now that I'm thinking about it, have lanes for snipers and scouts. They also have close quarters sections and routes for flanking. It allows many different types of gunplay. Equinox does not. Its personally my least favorite map in the game
---
Source?
---
Inb4 hunter main 
---
Litterally. Been raining since launch
---
I'm not trying to be rude. If I came off that way, my apologies lol. I just have zero fun in the crucible, and kind of salty at how much the game is tied into that one game mode. 
---
I paid for the annual pass they should just give the weapons to me.
---
Lol, well keep in mind, if all the blueberries fleee.... anytime you’re not going against a 4stack the competition will be significantly harder. 
---
It’s not hard. All the MLG 420 blaze it pro’z just take it too seriously. 
---
He’s definitely eaten Cabal and Eliksni at some point and probably his old crew when Gary took the Traveller

One eyed mask with wardcliff coil.

Sentry with Ursa furiosa for the win walked through it the amount of supers I got was unbelievable, great for the best offense triumph
---
If destiny sucks then unsub from destiny subreddits then lol
---
Dredgen Vale liked that 
---
Cool, I'll take a look :)
---
Oh, lots of people said it was too hard. Why do you think no one liked the tlw or now the thorn crucible steps? (Particularly the tlw in this instance)
---
It's cage match PvP, that alone is enough for me to avoid it entirely.  Have no idea how hard or easy it is.
---
You forgot the /s
---
Once you get used to keeping your distance and playing with staying alive in mind, instead of just looking for kills, yeah, it's easy.
---
1.5-1.7 range cmo SOLIDheadshot
---
Pretty much my situation was the same. But then my teammate whipped out his big juicy Jotunn. 
---
Thank you i will have to try that!
---
Yeah, but can a wardcliff do that 6 times with one ammo pickup?
---
Shadows of Yor liked that.
---
Dude good fucking idea
---
Crazy stuff lol
---
It’s lore stuff
---
Ophidian made my fighting lion and my Duke *awesome*
---
Shuri(?) one of the techeuns taken also talks about hunger and wanting to eat her enemies. I'm not sure if it is an effect of the Taken or bungie's writing style. 
---
I stayed sub in hopes of the game being good again but doesn’t look that will ever happen. GG
---
If you suck, you shouldn’t play with good players? I never would have guessed.
---
Because they weren't having fun.
---
😂😂😂😂😂👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👌🏻💯💯💯 *BRUH MOMENT*
---
Yeah, I know I’m in the upper % of people who play crucible, and that has a lot to do with it. However, I feel like so often the people who struggle just aren’t making the good tactical choices fast enough. 
---
Today, I was laning B to C side on Pacifica. I had TLW/Sniper. People **kept running through the upper doorway** and I would snipe them. If I got flanked or pinched, I was fucked because I was basically alone. **Nope**. One or two times people came from other directions but I basically just held one position because they kept making poor tactical decisions. 
---
I know there’s a big PVP/PVE divide in the D2 community and I understand that. To be *good* in Crucible you have to have Raid level situational awareness *and* get lucky with good drops. It’s a completely different play style, and I know it’s not for everyone. 
---
The thing that frustrates me is this dogged pursuit of “the meta” as the only solution, and it isn’t! For example, before anyone was using fusions again, my clan mates and I ran into a guy using Erentil in comp and he **destroyed** us. We ended up friending him and taking him with us, but it was an unbelievable experience to get so wrecked by a gun I had never heard of. It’s possible, you just have to be willing to experiment. 
---
Sometimes those experiments will go well, and sometimes they won’t. *That’s okay.* It’s important to be willing to get out of the box. 
---
# WHA?
---
Fated Engrams don’t give Year two loo...oh. Shit man, that is nuts.
---
Its pretty freakin easy if you have decent movement controlls I drop like 20+ kills a game 
---
Afraid I can't help you, the on in the director worked just fine for me!
---
Oh nvm, I had to shoot the robot thing which was pulling me in and then it got pretty easy.
---
Am I the only one reading "TTK" as "The Taken King."

Hmm. Only way I can think of is standing on that rock pillar at the path, but it didn't work when I tried

Is the car crash a public event?

Well if you have 23 legendary shards id go pick up the crimson, its the red death in handcannon form (still a 3 round burst) from xur

This is a hilarious comment. I hope this get 10k likes. XD

Yeah, those Arc Chieftain tethers are so annoying

Yo, this. This is the answer right here

Oh okay I gotcha bud, after I get that LL up to par I’ll go for it, until then I’ll hope I get lucky

Find a team using the companion app and try again?

You get it from the competitive milestone of completing 3 matches.

[Here is a chart showing how much the damage you deal is reduced and the damage you take is increased](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9gwl1u/powerlevel_based_damage_scaling_in_pve_aka_power/) when you are below the power level of enemies.

*Gets Exotic sword quest flashbacks* (Yes I decided to get the swords in tandem with subclasses I didn't use, was a nightmare bc I needed to upgrade the respective subclasses too)
---
You're so right ah ah
---
Tell them it's charity, technically is.
---
I don't think so, unless you get a modified controller, which I'm pretty sure breaks ToS somewhere.
---
I played competitive, got smoked and my teammates all messaged me to tell me to uninstall the game :(

I just got this exact roll but with rampage instead of genesis!

I just closed Destiny. I dont want to get cancer out of that.

I didn't have an issue, what servers are you playing on?

I'm 90% sure love is the actual answer, but kudos to you for the joke

I was steady w a 3.4 k/d as an arc warlock. Crucible is v easy.

Roses have prickles not thorns.

It's a prickle.

Wait wha? Triggers? Pls tell more

Bugger, I've made up my mind. He's got a cool french name!

This is a prickle, not a thorn...
---
It’s not a pvp game. If you buy it for pvp you will hate it. It’s a pve game.
---
yea guy was probably a tool but at the same time I don't blame him.. 
---
you cant really tie morally playing the game right to meet your standard just as he cant do it to you..
---
 especially when the ease of accessibility to do that is literally handed to him.. sucks yea but its just the way it is
---
bungie would have to do something about it on their end for anything to really come of it.. other than that its just a battle of moral perspective of playing the game "the correct way" which no one has any right to tell him otherwise  because it doesn't suite their own standard of how to play
---
Your rewarded synths based on ur play style in gambit prime. Let me see if i can find a video for you
---
Mmmmm **Burgers**
---
Except I can’t kill aliens and pop celestial bombs and aliens in division 2 🤷‍♂️
---
I love the dlc, try not to say “we” 
---
thank you, that would be super helpfull, cause I have the feeling that even if I stand the whole game at the bank and kill Blockers I still get the Reaper Synth
---
The weapons only drop on tier 2/3
---
As anyone else been getting a bunch of Exotics lately 
---
Wait
---
Trinity was sold last week?! I’m never going on vacation again
---
Destiny 2 is a looter shooter game, which means that as you progress through the various campaigns you get more and more loot. Some of it's good and some of its bad.
---
The main campaign is decent, and if you're willing to purchase forsaken (the biggest DLC) a whole lot of (great) content is added in. Would not recommend Curse of Osiris (tiny DLC) and Warmind (mid size DLC) is decent too.
---
There is a ranking system for pvp. there are also separate casual/ranked matchmaking.
---
There is no ranking system for pve
---
Then there is Gambit, a game mode exclusive to forsaken owners. Gambit acts as a PvPvE experience. You and 3 other people fight the enemies of humanity, then they drop motes you have to collect. You deposit those into a bank. Periodically, somebody from the enemy team will invade giving them the opportunity to kill you and make you drop all your motes. Once 75 motes are deposited, you summon a Primeval, a big bad enemy your team has to kill. Invaders who kill you during the Primeval phase heal your Primeval.
---
There is a ranking system for Gambit.
---
Then there is the annual pass. The annual pass allows for scheduled drops of content every now and again. I will not go into the specifics of the annual pass here.
---
I try to view each match as if it's a boss fight with random modifiers and adds.  If I win good onto the next game where I'll try to win again. If I lose it's just like a wipe, and hopefully do better next time.  
---
like you say easy/hard can't really define a single match either way but I think overall trends largely start to hold.   
---
You used to not be able to. You sure?
---
Heres a video it also tells u how to get the 4 prime weapons as well
---
https://youtu.be/ZR04wLB79bQ
---
Its all leading up to the way shin malphur has hinted at we have to wal between light and dark in order to actually have a chance at fighting the darkness. Which makes all the more sense why shin is using the drifter in his schemes to bait bad guardians. Because as we know from the complete aunor book even the likes of praxic fire are at risk of corruption.
---
Destiny sucks Change my mind 
---
I mean most people when they say this they don't mean to just "hand them the weapon"
---
They mean stuff like making us wait an entire month for Last Word, Izanagi's Burden, etc. instead of just giving us the ability to get the weapons off the bat if we feel like doing the grind for them. 
---
Waiting till they damage primevil means they get stacks first. Unless it is late in damage phase, it is always better to invade and delay their stacks as long as possible(not going for team wipe, just stalling).
---
 This gives your team the chance to get ahead in stacks and melt the prime down. Once it is 3RE or 4th, you want to invade to heal, particularly on enemy damage.
---
By invading sooner, you start the cooldown on the portal sooner, giving you more options later.
---

I was expecting a "Whether we wanted it or not..."
---
Damn oops mb
---
I see. I was thinking of the Taken portals.
---
there's a bunch of people that constantly complain about pvp, I'd say this is more a jab at those than at people that don't want to pvp. 
---
You poor soul, if it makes you feel any better the same thing happened to me  and ghjallahorn in d1 year 1. I got back and was so mad

You need fully upgrade your synthetiser
---
Your welcome hopfully this helps, you can also speak to the drifter and he'll have weekly boutines that give synths too
---
i didnt check sorry
---
highly appreciated m8
---
I read , always play with people who sre better than you. Then, learn how they doing it. A couple of times... I out think them... Simply because thet think they have a plan... While my team keeps coming from same direction... Or keeps poking thier head out. I change my gun when they think i have short range, or vice versa. They counting on us to keep doing the same thing. I switch it up. I still loose but i have fun. Mainly( unless a quest like yall talking about) i still get my stuff, get my level up... Or sometimes... I dont work so hard for the quest. It makes me sad. So , when i am doing crucible.... I just pull out the gun or whstever.... And go from there. I on just got my NIGHTSHADE the day before the season 6 drop. ... 
---
I would say it's going to be okay, but it just isn't
---
I picked hunter because I like being nimble and quick, but hunters aren’t the most OP sub class I think warlock takes the cake on that title

She just standing tf have you done Guardian

I got prodigal strides! Wtf!

Oh I get killed by those all the time, I just haven't done the quests yet

Lady I saved your ass I can do what I want

Collection purposes

I learn a fair bit from watching teammates, learning spawn rotation / map knowledge etc. I have so many unfinished quests because I just end up doing the bits I enjoy. Can't really do the big raids as they are hard to solo lol
---
It's been so long since I've played D1 that I honestly don't remember
---
Because d2 pvp is designed for casuals that have slow thumbs

I'm using a void auto rifle + Better Devils and a sentinel titan

Yeah no you definitely got it worse
---
I retract my complaint

May RNG be a blessing unto you

May RNG be a blessing unto you

No better way to take that beast out and break their grip on Freehold, tbh.
---
It’s not hard, just incredibly annoying. Nobody uses skill weapons. They just use crutch guns that one shot or their Luna’s/NF they paid for
---
In vanilla, we only had 2 subclasses per classes, with each respectively missing one specific elemental.

You didn't go far enough. Get through that portal to her throne world

Hey N.Z. Love ya . my fam all lives there.. ... Also... My prayers are with you all. So so sorry

check my follow up post :D

I'd recommend doing it now on comp while lots of others are doing it. Less sweaty that way
---
I was lucky enough to be playing warlock. Titan has it really rough because you had to rely on grenades. 
---
Good idea. I have all weekend off for once
---
More like... chasm of whispers.
---
It just happened again, recollected almost all of them and they disappeared. 
---
You’re mad because 6 friends like to get together and play crucible... lmao. Okay buddy
---
And do what with it? Kinda newish player who steamrolled thru Mercury to get to forsaken storyline.
---
would it hurt them too much to have the one forsaken non raid exotic I'm missing
---
With a burning appreciation 
---
As long as you are conciously ruining other peoples day im fine with that! 
---
[removed]
---
It’s not hard, I get as many kills as deaths, if not more, but it’s about as fun spending the round one shotting people with the many options you have as it is getting one shot. Those two happening alternately just makes it a boring back and fourth of trading kills for deaths, which works in games like titanfall, where you respawn instantly and have fast enough movement to get to the guy who killed you in no time, but in destiny where you are slow and immobile it’s just a pain in the ass. But of course this is just my take on it 
---
No screams if we're all dead
---
You can buy a bunch of simulation seeds and turn them into brother Vance, dismantling the gear he gives you returns a large chunk of shards and gives you a decent amount of gunsmith material. 
---
thats literally what bungie does though.. salty casual people bitch and complain on this sub like no other until something gets nerfed or removed and it always caters to and is in favor of the average casual.. 
---
non buttered up
---
the devs cater to fuckin scrubs that whined like a spoiled child till they change it and ruin the game based on how the scrubs bitched about said topic... seen it way to many times 
---
Look up the definition of prickle and come back and tell me what it says you’re gonna be shocked.
---
I mean, you’re gonna have a rough time with pulse/smg right now because, unless you’ve already got kill clip or rampage stacks, a shotgun is gonna close on you too fast. Fusions and snipers are definitely viable, especially with all the apes running around. Give the vendor (collections) Erentil a shot. You have to play smart, but you can voop those apes to space. If you like it, you can try and get one from banshee rolled to your liking. 
---
Also, look for **scavenger perks** on your armor. Getting 2-3 shots per green brick is a revelation. 
---
I know, it's just funnier than 99% to be at 100% but not done.
---
So having to wait until some one invaded without a queensbreaker or sleeper stimulant and to then use their super only to try and kill them wasnt easy? Hmmm idk partner 
---
What's up guys it's Rick Khakis here
---
Didn't know that... Thanks
---
I startrd. Out being dead last every single time. Then... My goal was to not be last. Then my goal was score 10. Finally... I am almost average.. My high is 34. And thats not against a bunch of sucky folks . like it was a close good game. And sometimes i suck more... Ha ha . sorry to all. But again. Its about MY PERSONAL BEST. Not the best players who beat me. Cause i suck so bad, I dont really care if i loose to an A team who has been in there all day... I for sure am so much bettere. And i read and watch... And TRY NOT TO KEEP doing things the same way.... Ha ha ha

Also cores and slim chance for year 1 exotics, if you don't have all of them
---
It’s a different game type that caters to a different set of skills. I have a lot of fun in crucible, and that’s on all 3 classes, with everything from snipers to aping with a full auto shotty to using Polaris lance (don’t sleep on it!). You do have to find what you like. When I’m missile Titan, sliding and whirling around with bonus dmg, I feel like an unstoppable god. 
---
Sometimes you get nova bombed out of your super. Yeah it sucks, but then you learn to watch out for shut down supers and make sure they are cleared off the field or used before you pop. Stuff like that. 
---
Keep the power the same. Just increase the level cap
---
As a person who just started 6months before D2... I think of that almost everyday. I think its an amzing game. If i were a professional plsyer maybe i could see all those little things... I dinno... I cant keep up... And im hooked
---
Thanks bro. Very sad times for our little country :( 
---
I generally stay out of the crucible unless my clan mates want to do some PvP or when I need to complete a quest step (The Last Word). I got the last word in about a day and a half.  I don't think I'm gonna grind as hard for this one and take my time with it. From the looks of it, The Last Word (to me) seems like the better of the two guns competitive wise. I know I'll get Thorn eventually, I'm just not gonna grind for it like I did the last word.
---
Ah. Thanks
---
What step of Nascent Dawn are you on? One of that quest's steps *is* an override frequency, so until you use it (progress to the next Nascent Dawn step) you cannot craft more. 
---
That level of RNG is a on a new level though. Because Wish-Ender is a recently discovered, then that means OP’s probably not done ST at least that many times before (if at all) which means they’re truly blessed.
---
Why? They’ll just wait out the invasion, and as soon as you’re gone they’ll have an entire free damage phase
---
Unil you drink for lunas
---
But that’s so exciting! You know how much you don’t know and can pursue the heights of those you’ve witnessed. The vendor roll is good enough to get started but yeah: I got a projection fuse/firmly planted/quickdraw (eventually) and it **maps**
---
Why would you be scared?  Kinda dramatic princess 
---
Hard light
---
Im on the step where you I have to find a cache in olympus descent.. do I have to do this First?
---
it is. it's powerful 
---
Navy Seals, anyone?
---
I remember red death was so good, where do you get those legendary shards?
---
Really? With that score? You cheater.....
---
Right, so what you're all telling me is that...
---
The Vanguard has actually never let anyone die.
---
Good to know! 
---
..damn thats hardcore
---
D2 sucks so bad lol nothing to do
---
Yeah but if in turn Bungie DID do something about it then he’d probably still complain. “Why did I get banned, that’s not fair, I paid for this, I should be able to do as I please, blah blah blah”
---
I honestly don’t see how anyone could possibly complain about this questline.  It’s ridiculously, almost insultingly easy for a PvP centric gun.
---
... And I presume the big, purple eye just sat there and watched, probably in that lone armchair that always sits in the corner.
---
&gt;	The guy was trying to justify why he thought it was fine to use macros to sidestep being kicked for going AFK in crucible &amp; gambit
---
This is so disappointing when it happens. Is there no way to report them during the game to get them kicked manually? I've just been reporting them after the match ends when the scores come up.
---
Wait, so you’re saying, Blue guy is wearing rare Vanguard armor, Black guy is wearing Raid armor
---
Brown guy is always drunk listening to loud music?
---
this is actually the wrong way to do it. you should invade asap because you need to delay their primeval slayer stacks as long as you can. and if you can keep them from killing the envoys, it makes for more adds to deal with while trying to dps.
---
sounds noice, I'll go boop some stuff with it later but stupid Xur just gave me Wardcliff so now I *have* to go explode everything with that.
---
Let him play the first half of Last Call then take him back to happy mcfunland where cayde is still alive
---
Dismantling legendary gear and some shaders 
---
Shaders = 1 shard gear= 3 shards with exotics being higher i believe also crimson is still really good imo i use it on all strikes missions stuff like that
---
Can’t wait for spooky boy
---
I do every time 
---
"Out of respect for principles (and a righteous fear of Ikora's big-ass shotgun)..."
---
I hate everything crucible except crimson days. The dynamics in doubles are so perfect, it's not unreasonable to win an engagement alone, you get a good chance at getting to play with your heavy weapon... It's awesome. 
---
Soooo... He happy after je gets it. ???
---
I just started Forsaken. The feels when Cayde dies.....
---
Kajit has wares if you have coin
---
It’s easy even for the ones that suck at PvP? I feel like my HCs don’t do much 
---
That sounds like a incredible idea, but there’s one problem. He beat the campaign and looked 
---
up “destiny 2 dlc”.     You can see where that ended him up
---
You gotta be trollin right? Nothing to do? LMAO guys... he says there’s NOTHING to do in destiny. Guess this guy grinds harder and faster than all of us because there’s still shit I haven’t done from the release of d2 over a year ago
---
Damn it... Looks like we need a pen and some alien mind wipe tech...
---
oh no...
---
Did you do the Gambit Prime quest and the Reckoning step?
---
Plus a pair of ray bans 
---
I know right! I had one with shotgun scav and last week I got my second with snipe scav which made me a happy warlock main. Also because of the fact that the only exotic I'm missing on my warlock is the new gauntlet
---
And Will Smith
---
If you play through it a second time on a different character it’s even worse
---
It’s not an opinion when it’s just straight up wrong. An opinion would be “Destiny is not a good game”. You said there’s nothing to don which is a lie. There’s literally tons of shit to do. 
---
Will smith looking at this
---
“ Ahhha, that’s sad, ah that’s sad”
---
One day tentacle man might sell it
---
Bergusian night isn’t spelt with a Calus or a Selected
---
What really got me was him calling me his little buddy
---
Then i dont know why you cant
---
The guy complaining that having to increase his light level every time there’s a new expansion really read like a parody today.
---
Try not bringing a light level increase and see how people react.
---
too real
---
Jumping to and into places you aren't supposed to go is my favorite thing from old MMO's. 
---
One of the things that really hammered in how Destiny is more than "just another shooter" back in 2014 was seeing people jumping on things over and over to get places they shouldn't in the Tower.
---
like what
---
No lie. I joined a clan that runs trai ing raids.before when d2came out... Now i use the lfg ... Or better yet...these sherpas love to help. Then you can start to network. You actaully have to work... At getting out there. And since i suck... Its been hard. But now there are more optiins.. 
---
Yes sir
---
Where is this?
---
Poor Bungie, they seem like such sweet people and they're always trying to make their players happy, they deserve a better fanbase. 
---
I like hard light alot but I have 6 cut and run's  and 4 crooked fangs with really good perks 
---
Then I think Its a bug. I wish I could help you, unless you're choosing Vanguard of course...
---
Hopefully. Its the only warlock exotic i dont have and want the most
---
Is this a cinematic for a quest.
---
I have Thorn, so it's not that one. 
---
Get gud
---
I felt this pain when I silos that thing, it was always the thrall that got me
---
Who ?
---
Let’s see, strikes, heroic mission, patrols, public events, crucible, gambit, gambit prime, the reckoning, multiple raids, blind well, escalation protocol, lost sectors, grinding loot, grinding for titles like “dredgen, wayfarer” etc. nightfall strikes, I mean, there’s probably more I could keep going?
---
Because it's boring to shoot 2 bursts into somebody's chest cavity only to watch them hide behind a pillar and recharge fully.

A lower TTK bring much more balanced gameplay in my experiences and much more enjoyable experiences too.
---
You might get killed fast and there's nothing you can do. But the same is true for the enemies as well.
---
Tactics, such as flanking, ambushing and general game sense are much more encouraged in a game where you can kill quickly.
---
Long TTK games usually boil down to gear / abilities. (Current Destiny 2)
---
Is it available to everyone or just for annual pass holder?
---
FINALLY got my hands on Chromatic Fire! As a warlock main it feels great to get something neat from Xûr!
---
I just started playing and just beat Xol.
---
Was definitely expecting something more difficult. Doing it solo took like 10 mins pretty much lol
---
Still live casually playing tho! Love the steady progression in this game it's really not that grindy unless you make it that way
---
It's from the new "Invitation From The Nine" quest. You buy it from Xur, who's currently on Titan. 
---
well it should have all been there for release. I played at curse of Osiris and there was nothing to do. Bungie should make it free for us players
---
There's always waiting till bungie add forsaken exotics to fated engrams.
---
I'll just leave this here

Well played, although I wouldn't think it'd be hard to get from where you were before since it was a straight shot. Still impressed nonetheless
---
I used sixth coyote for double invisible dodges. I was the last one alive many times.
---
Yeah it’s not too bad to be honest. I’m not sure how it was in D1 but I’m pretty sure it was impossible. 
---
took me about two goes, you pmuch just gotta trust you gut and punch the boost
---
My hunter friends changed to a warlock for almost 2 months to get and finish the quest.
---
You're match against these people because it is the beginning of the season and almost everyone is close to each other in glory rank. They will not change going against stacks because it is supposed to be competitive people arent mindlessly supposed to go into the playlist just getting kills not paying attention to the objective. There is many lfgs to go on to form fire teams so you can have extra communication while in this playlist.
---
I’m probably never playing Crucible again unless I have to but personally, the Malfeasance does a good job if you get your headshots. 
---
Certainly better than the garbage I get from Ada
---
*Jaren Ward is rolling in his grave*
---
... no it's not bruh
---
Better than Gjallahorn! I love it!
