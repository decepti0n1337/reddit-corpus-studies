Why grind for the whisper anymore really
---
---
---
Way too quickly
---
So do I win? cause I can legit say "blackout" 
---
I've been in enough last wish raids to see all of this happen about twice
---
Just lost a competitive clash match 17 to 75
---
my cars transmission broke
---
CR10S
---
Pretty much yeah I play iron banner with a 368 light level because I can‚Äôt afford forsaken but it‚Äôs even worse when people camp the whole game in the corner with a shotgun
---
Yeaah. Our other 2 teammates left before the first round was even over I think.
---
I appreciate the t-bag
---
Shards also getting nerfed actually
---
Eh it‚Äôs just D1 Black Spindle now just that‚Äôs in the heavy spot
---
its not a hammer. just used for cocking the internal hammer
---
Time to main a titan
---
The nerfs coming
---
NAAAAIIIIISU
---
Turn in the extra Drifter engram and get an exotic
---
Thanks
---
Why are we still here? My PvE Luna's Howl, and your Whisper of the Worm. They're gone but we can still feel them like they're still here.
---
bungie we want to have power fantasy ... NERFS EVERYTHING. gg bungie might be loosing alot of people to Borderlands 3 if you keep fucking up
---
No You, the Chinese clown?
---
It's like Infinity War, but with our gear.
---
No, the racist joke.
---
Yup, glad we had the black hammer version while we did
---
nerf to exotics giving super energy back (skull, orpheus, pheonix) also a fucking neutering of whisper of the worm no longer giving us ammo from aether
---
To hell with them.
---
the weather
---
all people complaining of the nerf that is absurd and make the whisper useless the whisper still have more damage in precision hits, that's his perk not infinite ammo.

People have been calling for a nerf for outbreak already but if bungie nerfs an iconic gun like 3 weeks out of release they'll be berated so much that they'll be forced to undo it.
---
OH MAI GAHD
---
There‚Äôs so many specific things to do for that, congrats; I‚Äôll be going after it once I finish Blacksmith next week.
---
well after the recent nerfs to hunters in general, i think they want to just kill off the class.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
like pvp we only really had arc and top tree void, now we got arc, which is still shit.
---
am just surprised they didnt buff titans some more.
---
It's already become useless for SoTP... I'd actually rather DPS with colony than whisper at this point
---
oh god no, shards should never return to how it was, but it needed to be fix in general, seeing half the time the tracking wouldnt even work and as such makes it completely useless. and seeing how super returns are based from knife hits and not kills means at most you get 20%, maybe 30 if you're lucky.
---
Of course! Do you expect bungie to competently balance their game? Of course not!
---
OOOOAaaaaaHHHHewnananana
---
i mean the bow armour is good, the issue is that bows are shit.
---
they really need to be either a 1 tap, have tracking and keep their 2 hit ability, or turn into 3 taps but be like other guns and turn them into hit scans.
---
My issue is now I have to dismantle my Lucky pants.
---
DARCI and Luna‚Äôs/Rally barricade will be in the next meta.
---
They weren‚Äôt exactly amazing in the first place.
---
Welp...no point in using it anymore
---
with the way things are going.... don't worry... DARCI is next.....
---
The Drifter just watching the game while enjoying some cabal snacks
---
I was wondering why I kept seeing Whisper pop up on my newsfeed. Now I know and I am so upset! Goodbye my friend, it was a blast while it lasted!
---
Are you eating my ass? What's the point in the gun if they take away the whole reason anyone ever used it? It was fun, it was reliable, and it looked amazing.
---
What happened to straying from hammering nails even with the board, and instead pulling the lower nails even with the rest?
---
Strong edit bro/ladybro
---
If they nerf outbreak I‚Äôm done.
---
well the issue with low is that it could melt boss's like nothing else.
---
like it literally did what whisper could do, but faster, not as much damage in the long run, but any boss you need to kill now, you had to run lord. though nerfing it was stupid, just needed to extend the damage it did over a slightly longer period. if that.
---
HAHAHA! SO THE ONLY ADVANTAGE IT HAS OVER DARCI IS GONE! HAHA! 
---
THE WHISPER IS NOW USELESS HAHAHA! 
---
well that being said, time to finish grinding for the catalyst
---
It was all needed
---
RIP
---
F
---
I thought it was like each kill you get with the super gives you diminishing returns. So getting a bunch of kills with a nova bomb won‚Äôt give you full super because of the diminishing returns
---
Like in y1 of d2. Great...
---
We need black shaders. On my Warlock I have to use either midnight talons or calus selected(?!) to get black. 
---
*Oddly enough calus selected gives the darkest blacks on some items.
---
I finally got shards two weeks ago. I was wondering why it wasn‚Äôt doing anything. That explains a lot
---
Pillaged and recluse
---
Skull , phoenix protocol , whisper , ace and lord of wolves you forgot üòÇü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Who in there right minds, when seeing two of their creations would take the better creation and make it worse in order to level it out with the lesser creation. If you have twins, and one is doing better in a class and jumps ahead a grade, you don't feed him lead paint chips to try to make him like the other, you concentrate on the one that is behind and try to help him be better.
---
Boost the lesser used items, make harder new content like they have been doing (the Thorn and Outbreak were great quests!). Maybe even introduce things like the Iron Banner debuff tokens to PvE for better rewards, give people a reason to play old stuff because it's been made fun again, don't force us to play/use it because the new stuff sucks now too.
---
üòÇ
---
TOO MAN SOON
---
Literally the moment I read the TWAB i went on r/DestinyTheGame just to see how people were complaining about the nerfs.
---
Kek
---
Now it‚Äôs just black spindle in the heavy slot, everyone is gonna go to DARCI now and then they‚Äôll nerf that along with outbreak
---
I don‚Äôt use neither but what the hell happened this week
---
Outbreak and Acrius better
---
They‚Äôre nerfing all orb generating exotic armor pieces too...
---
WAIT WUT
---
Now it‚Äôs just black spindle, time to go to DARCI
---
They announced that all of these will be nerfed , including luna and nf too .
---
This is also a possibility
---
Kill him!
---
Instead we get D1 nostalgia, it‚Äôs black spindle now!
---
Why do I waste all this time chasing exotics just for them to become worthless
---
Now it‚Äôs old old friend, I‚Äôm going to start calling it Black Spindle now
---
The  black and gold is pretty much midnight talons
---
&gt;If you can‚Äôt play the game without the broken exotics you don‚Äôt deserve them.
---
There's a massive difference between being able to play the game without them and *wanting* to play the game without them. If they're gonna take away the only useful things we have and leave the rest of the game a burning wreck, then what's the point?
---
Can they not destroy my baby
---
What the fuck why exactly?
---
Now a lunafactions boots with literally any sniper rifle will do the same thing as this new passive and you dont even need to hit crits... guess im using Darci
---
most likely exotics that give supers back will be 100% useless. so that teather subclass garbage, shards super garbage, slow nova garbage. bungie should be ashamed of themselves saying they "listen" to the player base fucking lying out the ass.
---
You have the numbers on how many people have completed the DARCI catalyst? Where‚Äôs your information sourced?
---
‚ÄúDestiny Dev Team: For Season of Opulence, several notable weapons are being adjusted.  We want to ensure that encounters‚Äîraids and other endgame content, for example‚Äîremain a challenge. Some of these weapons have been overwhelming that challenge. Our first choice is to buff underused weapons, but if we continue to push every weapon up higher and higher, it will be impossible to maintain challenging experiences. This is not a full list of changes, but some of the most impactful.‚Äù
---
And isn‚Äôt the full list too... lol 
---
Let‚Äôs see what will happen! 
---
Good Luck to us.
---
Jesus the grammar in this one
---
But worse because it is a heavy weapon
---
It's what all true warriors strive for. [](/kchangelingwarrior)
---
Seriously, i don‚Äôt mind a nerf to exotics that clearly are being used infinitely more than others but half the reason i play this game is tok get that power fantasy. Yet bungie decides we should nerf two of the most useless exotics due to their nerfs instead of buffing others and increasing the difficulty of things like regular strikes.
---
Yep. They're evil little shits
---
Wait what happened to whisper?
---
dont forget pheonix is getting nerfed also. looks like they want all classes to be dog shit tier
---
Lol a good sidearm. Youre funny
---
It‚Äôs turning into black spindle. But the ammo reserve nerf is being undone. Back up to 18.
---
I mean don‚Äôt get me wrong I wish it didn‚Äôt needa be nerfed but idk
---
Whispered breathing still makes whisper better.
---
Not certain but I think they are merging white nail perk, again. Same as D1.
---
They should just turn it into a special weapon instead of heavy too
---
In what situation where prolonged boss DPS is needed is it not the go-to? I‚Äôm not being snarky - I‚Äôm not a pro player but I do see whisper everywhere you need reliable DPS for more than a short burst.
---
Broken? how was shards of galanor broken before this nerf in its current state? oh right. It wasnt.
---
&gt; First of all, no one forced you to run Orpheus/Skull/Phoenix.
---
No but they‚Äôre easy mode exotics.
---
Well lets face it, titans arent the best for pve
---
Tbh imma just watch this play out. I‚Äôm not fully okay with the nerf but seeing all this negative energy, even though it might make Bungie fix their mistake (and I hate how brutal the community is being but if that persuaded the devs so be it), I‚Äôm gonna be optimistic and just kinda see how badly the nerf hits us, then reconfigure my raid loadouts to more viable options
---
But they don't listen. They do SO much to slow this game down its getting ridiculous.
---
If you kill yellow bars with Shards, you get about 60% super back, though the second throw has to also land and kill that yellow bar. 
---
I don't get why people act like they are complete trash, cuz they aren't. They don't regen super like Orpheus and Skull by amount of ads killed, instead they give back energy based on knives hit on higher ranking enemies. If someone runs tether in gambit, I always run Shards to almost always get infinite super on envoys and PE, though I'll be honest sometimes shards are really inconsistent and I don't get energy back cuz the tracking throws my second bunch of knives somewhere else.
---
hunters have melting point too
---
No delete this before bungie see it !
---
Wow this blew up more than i expected. Just as my group was thinking about coming back to destiny after skipping the gambit season bungie hits us with this. Guess we will be staying away from this season too.
---
But it requires spectral, which is almist useless in pve
---
That it exactly what's happened, they've designed the new raid and the raid test team have used whisper probably in a few encounters or one. But more than the raid team would prefer.
---
Then someone in management has said. "Hey instead of adding some movement to the target, (like the scourge boss) let's just stop the weapon being effective"
---
It's just lazy. This does not bode well for the future.
---
Imagine a world where you can cheese riven with trinity ghoul
---
Bongo...
---
Old thread but the same thing has happened to me, did you ever find a solution?
---
I am not a good player. I dont have the skill to be honest. I enjoy destiny 2 a lot but this "nerf" to everything is very annoying. but let people enjoy their effort. fuck it if is over power.
---
All this tells me is that there will be hordes of enemies in the next raid which we can't Nova Bomb or Shadowshot infinitely anymore. Instead, we'll need to coordinate with another person in the fireteam to alternate making orbs to do the *exact same thing*.
---
Gotta call it the Go Slow update now.
---
Wtf are they thinking? What is going on with bungie? The guy in charge of the raids and the guy who made the story for forsaken both left bungie within a ten minute span. Other people left as well, and now it's almost like they're TRYING to ruin their own game. Spectral blades have probably needed a nerf in crucible for awhile bc they last forever. But whisper? And the skull of dire ahamkara? Orpheus rigs? Are you serious? First time I've really had an issue with a nerf. You guys finally got rid of Activision and have the creative freedom to make destiny what you want it to be, and THIS is what you do? You're gonna kill this franchise
---
What do you mean? Don‚Äôt you want more melee charges so you can melee after your melee? /s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
Can someone explain to me what ‚Äúreducing the super gain cap‚Äù means when bungie refers to shards? Does that mean it gets even worse? The wording is screwing with me
---
You absolute madlad
---
so are titans :(
---
Did it with the free silver I got from the season pass, I don't regret using it on that either, I just regret thinking I was gonna be able to use a good weapon for a long time and not see a nerf.
---
Better skills than I ! I‚Äôm just gonna slap some music on it and credit you...whenever I get around to it
---
That is not correct. The "PVE energy return remains similar to before" is referring to Gwisin Vest in particular, because that bullet point is indented below the one about Gwisin Vest. 
---
[A link to the TWAB](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47823)
---
Might as well delete it from the game.
---
They gonna come for this hidden gem next
---
Not even trying to get through it anymore. I left at the start of season of the drifter cos gambit wasn't my sort of thing, and with them nerfing everything I've just outright decided the game is just not fun for me anymore....  
---
And that makes me so sad tbh
---
Yeah, but you get to proc white nail 6 times (with no reserves). It will still be good if the entire team is using it, but it's a big ol' fuck you to solo players.
---
Icebreaker would be the biggest mistake to bring back. Js
---
yep pretty much
---
Not saying that I don't feel your pain but it took me almost 100 tries to get 1K.
---
Was just about to start working on my Whisper catalyst, but I guess I'll just do the one for Outbreak then
---
bsically going the f2p path of nerfing everything so people will want to invest time and money on new OP content.
---
No, since it's new xur doesn't have it yet :(
---
If only we could store it at the vault
---
Definitely.  Whenever I ask what exotic would you have if it couldn‚Äôt be gjal or the obvious choice of the vex myth, people tend to say iCeBrEaKeR.   Oddly I would love to see the monte in d2.
---
Can't switch if you never got Whisper
---
You know, I use the Duty Bound in white in rememberance of Monte Carlo, funny enough.
---
I heard someone say that Pocket Infinity should come back.. Like no. That shit was broken. Leave it in the past.
---
Destiny 3
---
In order to introduce new stuff to grind for you obviously need to make the old stuff useless! /s
---
If Bungie did not listen and did not care I doubt they would have done anything for any of the weapons and supers we would've wanted nerfed, but they did and they saw that the problems we were complaining about that specific super and changed it accordingly. They changed it eventually and that's what I'm getting at, we need to stop accusing Bungie of not listening when they clearly do and start being more patient and calm with them.
---
Pics art ftw
---
Borderlands 3 will be the reason Destiny dies.  The developers actually give a shit about the players.  Bungie is practically BioWare.  They do their own thing without listening to their customers.
---
Bungie nerf that
---
Miss ya bye! Bye byeüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Liek, I don't know what exactly what they *should* have done. But this? I'm not so sure it's the right thing to do.
---
ure absolutely right, they took the same way like massive did with division nerf nerf nerf nerf, look at them now...i honestly think destiny community is dumbest community, this should not be happening and we should do same as anthem community, boycott this game and not let this happen again again and again

Im around 0.9

No one likes their favourite gear or subclass being nerfed.
---
While some nerfs could be completely reasonable, to those who use them a lot it may just be complete tyranny.
---
That‚Äôs all there is to it really. 
---
Whisper won‚Äôt die out. It‚Äôs capacity has been upped to 18, which per person is more than enough to melt bosses.
---
Damn it. If only cross play was a thing.
---
Zavala didn't want vengeance, I was super disappointed in him when I got.to that part of the story, it's why I sided with the drifter instead of the vanguard. Zavala has gone soft
---
What's the Ace of spades nerf? Can I no longer 3 tap with memento mori? (I mean you could 2 tap with headshots and I guess that was a bit OP)
---
You say that it‚Äôs the idea of buffing vs nerfing.... but I don‚Äôt see any buffs!
---
Like I said throw enough shite.....
---
And people try to argue they listen to their community.
---
Ever since the 1k nerf on PC I have thought that they should balance the game differently  
---
Luna's/NF got nerfed cause it was prominent on console
---
Im sure there is a handful more things that got nerfed because a different client. 
---
Bungie really dont want anyone to have fun anymore lol
---
Skullfort is "good" too.
---
* Nerf super-regen exotics so they're less spammable and have diminishing returns 
---
* Nerf Whisper's infinite ammo so it's not seen as go-to for every boss in the game and gives other exotics a chance
---
* Balance out Sleeper's ricochet damage while leaving the actual precision damage untouched + buffing the body shot damage
---
And everybody's acting like it's the end of the world because without Whisper's practically infinite DPS the community are acting like they wont be able to kill anything anymore.
---
It does though... Otherwise there'd be huge 2-3 second gaps in damage every 7 shots. It ends when darci has fired all the shots that's even possible to be held, which I believe is like 21 or 22
---
I‚Äôm not getting thru Destiny ever again, back to Borderlands the game that truly started it all.
---
The white nail in the coffin.
---
I'm sorry
---
FFS, dude, use some paragraphs.
---
I do wonder if the raid testers had Outbreak Prime. If not it could go very badly for them.
---
I think they did, along time ago. But they haven‚Äôt stopped Nerfing things since then.
---
This is unbelievable
---
No one cares. Just quit.
---
Broken exotics deserved to be nerfed. Skull was blantly op and trivialised too much content simple as that.
---
To be fair... for a lot of the community that is very possible.
---
I thought the game was finally in a good place. Then they nerfed trench barrel. And now they're doing all this. 
---
I have no idea why they don't want players to feel powerful.
---
It's a shame they made Cayde's son less effective because of Titans ya know?
---
You didn‚Äôt read it then.  He outlines multiple scenarios, in a few of which it takes 11 seconds for whisper to outpace darci.  Are you trying to tell me it takes 11 seconds for darci to fire 7 shots, or are you willing to admit you are wrong.
---
you feel me lol. This game honestly was starting to feel a little too easy.
---
Not my poor shards again!
---
Welp... guess I'll go back to running Aeon Swift. /s
---
I mean console pleb here but that's not the issue. It's that the kill clip on Ace was nerfed because of a titan exotic lol
---
Same.
---
The gun is becoming black spindle (albeit there's whispered breathing but that is a catalyst and not a perk that comes with the gun) and black spindle was a special weapon with more ammo reserves I believe. (I do have not looked at the impact/range/handling and all those of the two guns so there may be a big difference there, but the perks are the same and that's what I mean)
---
What's happening to Phoenix Protocol?
---
Darci's perk is calling mjolnir "mew mew"
---
Can't see the screenshot.
---
Shhhhhhhhhh sshh shut your mouth before they hear you!.... But seriously they are just gonna nerf them again after nobody stops using them.
---
What in the name of thor do you mean by this
---
tfw no screenshot
---
18 is still a bit less than it was it it first came out I believe
---
Fuck you, bungie.
---
Hey, Khepri's Horn *did* kill Kalli. Anything good enough to do that should be nerfed into the ground. And while you're at it nerf fusion rifles.
---
I care. The loyalty of enthusiastic fans is valuable, and it is bad when a company pisses that away because of a shifting and nebulous design philosophy. They could have adjusted activities in such a way that the tactics these power weapons employed would not be effective against a raid boss. Like, not having easy line of sight, constantly being peppered by shots that throw your aim, shaky-cam explosions or just not having walls nearby to ricochet off of. These solutions are a mechanical fix to a level design problem.
---
This would be like nerfing the assault rifle from halo 1(by lowering its rate of fire) because it's too good at killing flood spores... when you could instead just be spreading out the spores instead of keeping them in a tight pack.
---
Thorn and Malfeasance
---
I only expect that kind of gameplay from the division because that was how the game was originally pitched
---
I hope they don't nerf lucky pants.
---
Thorn and Last Word
---
Loving it already!
---
The thing is that Whisper wasn't the best for short damage phases (Darci was), but Whisper was the go to if you had longer damage phases where you could just dump in as many shots as you wanted. Now the 18 will be gone quickly and it would have done less damage then a darci.
---
Melts bosses in a few reloads
---
I don't understand they nerfed it in D1 everyone was sad we stopped using it. They bring it back in all its glory and bam nerf it again. What was the point of bringing it back in the first place the way we want it only to change it again?
---
....*you are not wrong.*
---
I was so excited for the season of the drifter to end, and the next one to begin. Hoping for more PvE stuff.
---
Then this happened. I think I'm still going to play, but my excitement is tempered.
---
I think the only time the ricochet was super useful was Vosik in d1 and Argos from eow
---
Some do, But not us. Not. Us.
---
Most people already thought it sucked
---
Don‚Äôt give them any ideas!
---
Destiny devs: I'll kick your ass, I'll kick your dog's ass, I'll kick my own ass!
---
What a shame, they just really hate that gun
---
The funny part is that it's a nerf joke, but the part that makes it even funnier is that the Longarm is considered one of the worst performing nerf guns ever.
---
I don‚Äôt think so actually this game still has atleast a year and half left in it never too late for anything. 
---
Also @Op i would post this on r/destinythegame the devs don‚Äôt look at this subreddit (Well not to my knowledge)
---
Agreed.
---
Just got it on my 99th. You‚Äôll get it my dude
---
Looks like I've picked the right time to take a long break from this game after grinding at it for half a year on dailies and getting nothing but junk.
---
i pretty much got everything good my first run. i got chattering bones with a rampage roll as well.
---
WiLl Be ThErE. wE‚ÄôlL hIdE oUtBrEaK bEfOrE tHeY cAn GeT iT.
---
We said Anthem was supposed to learn from Bungie. Not the other way around!
---
That's the thing I don't understand: Who the hell was using Ursa anyway? That poor exotic was birthed and immediately shat upon. It had enough time to fill it's tiny lungs with air, but before it could even bring forth it's first cry, it was slapped across the face with a nerf turd.
---
What about Khepri's Horn, that fucker, right?!?! Where's the nerf there? Two effects?!?! Barricade AND Grenade? Are you mad??? Abomination!!! Nerf IT!!!
---
That game is trash XD
---
You Masterworked the receding hairline cloak?
---
Yeah no you're just wrong. Sure the game is easy but there are or.. We're some harder activities and to preserve that challenge stuff needs to be nerfed. It's a simple fact at game design and your opinion doesn't change that. Nerfs. Buffs gameplay adaptation is all involved in creating a healthy endgame sand box. These nerfs are justified. These were outliers that made encounters too hard to design around because they are too strong. There are so many objective reasons as to why these nerfs are justified and the only reason people can give against them is "muh powa fantasy" which as we well know killed many games end game such as Warframe. Buffing everything up to infinite nova bombs is simply stupid and that is exactly how power creep gets worse. We've seen it time and time again and the successful games use both nerfs and buffs as well as gameplay changes to create a good end game. No one with a brain complains when a class in ESO gets nerfed because it's called balance. These nerfs don't make guardians weaker, not at all, they make them balanced. Simple as that.
---
Well now no one would blame you using DARCI over Whisperer
---
I still have one in my vault since before collections came out! Light level 83 pariah.
---
And you lose your job
---
Well its a good thing I finished my DARCI catalyst.
---
Eventually it will wipe out the entire universe's creatures population and destroy fucking everything.
---
My anarchy helped me solo flawless Vorgeth (shattered throne ogre.) for that, that gun always has a place in my heart.
---
It appears you are asking a question about Destiny 2 error codes or a bug. 
---
We suggest Google searching your error code for more information about what you might be experiencing, or posting in /r/DestinyTechSupport
---
‚ÄúFun is not something one considers when balancing the universe.‚Äù
---
One singular Borderland 3
---
Also love that you get 60% of super from 4 sec
---
its nerf, adult neckbeards in cargo shorts use these. not kids
---
"You're just wrong", "simple fact", "objective reasons", "simple as that".
---
Yup, that's going to be the end of this conversation for me. We could have had a healthy discussion about this, but you don't seem to realize that yours is nothing more than an opinion as well. Kindly go f yourself.
---
Funny story in my post where I called Joker's Wild worse than Curse of Osiris I made a typo that I didnt see where I called it Joke's Wild
---
What about Hallowfire? Aint that still real good?
---
Bro I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt mean to do you like that!
---
[deleted]
---
Thnx bb ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Aaah. Fully agreed. Really, what are we gonna use? Unless you wanna be a handheld supernova PvP dude or have a dedicated team to pull lunafaction/geomag builds... even 50% free super is so far above any other exotics that it‚Äôs laughable.
---
aaaaaannnnnnd hit with a nerf
---
What is that far left one?
---
Depends on the content. If you're running content with match-game, or you're running Zero Hour and you're dealing with a section of enemies with Solar shields, then: yeah it's alright for the most part. But even then, the grenade recharges are still on the slow side unless you use a couple grenade mods in addition to it.
---
This is too much...
---
yeap
---
It‚Äôs insane how much they nerfed almost all the good guns.
---
Course of Osiris, I have all but the og one and oddly forsaken
---
And Shards of Galanor, Again.

Well, much as I enjoy these memes, I‚Äôm just gonna go back to playing since the game isn‚Äôt all about using Supers all the time. They helped, but we can manage without them coming up every ten seconds.
---
This seems a little strong looking for whisper
---
AsuraBoss, were in the endgame now...
---
Oh dang
---
This is perfect... lol
---
if only
---
Thank you lol
---
Right lol I had one too
---
The devs probably can‚Äôt nerf it because it hasnt dropped for them even after a dozen runs
---
Yup which makes those nerfs a failure if bungie wants exotic armor diversity they need to overhaul all the exotic armor to compete with super generating exotics. Its like if a restaurant sabotaged its popular orders to get people to eat the other ones which only results in the whole menu being shit.
---
pretty sure it's going to be exactly like that, in minecraft fun things aren't being removed, they're being added. which is what bungie is supposed to be doing
---
Honestly, it might not be worth the frustration. It's getting nerfed soon anyway and if you're missing out on dredgen for it, it probably isn't worth. And you can get it again other seasons anyway, if you feel you really want it.
---
We have removed the triggers from all guns, we hope this provides a more balanced experience
---
Omg, I can't quit laughing... xD
---
Took my 60th clear to finally get it 
---
Now when I run Last Wish I end up getting it constantly....all my 3 characters have one and the rest I use for infusions
---
Whoopi fucking do, you got 7 headshots out of 300 then you ran out of ammo and had to load out of the activity. Nice ‚Äúfarm‚Äù
---
Instead I‚Äôd suggest running around tangled shore sniping stuff, hitting flags, and picking up the occasional purple brick.
---
Best we can do is move on, friend. It‚Äôs not as if the game is unplayable without that stuff. Some people are just so spoiled by having rapid fire supers. Back in D1, most supers had to be well timed to get the best effect, instead of blanketing the area with ruination. PVE isn‚Äôt gonna be as simple as it was before, no, but it‚Äôs not impossible like some people think it is. Makes me think they suck with guns.
---
So y‚Äôall jumping to anthem with those nerfs ? Lol
---
I just don't think that clearing trash mobs was ever a challenge. I can certainly see the overall need to nerf Skull a little bit because of certain activities, but then I would rather tackle those certain activities. 
---
My point basically is: I don't think there are enough cases where Skull makes something much easier than any other Exotic and easier than it "should be" (whatever that means) to justify taking the fun of using it in any other case, where it's not a must-have, away. That's why I talked about D2 being easy anyways, because most content is easy and should either be harder in general or you should be able to have fun in it. In both those cases you should buff underpowered exotics.
---
Oh and making something harder is almost never fun if you do it by nerfing the player. If I get bored of running 3 miles a day then I'll run 5 or 3 up a hill, I don't shoot myself in the leg. If Strikes are too easy, then raise the PL of enemies etc.
---
I remember the SoTP Whisper disaster, but it again comes back to my view on Skull: if Whisper is only OP in SoTP and the new raid, then make the bosses crit spots smaller, make him move a little bit, let him have a mechanic where burst damage is better than DPS because his damage reduction goes up with time etc. That's basically what they did in LW with Kalli or Shuro Chi, no? I think it's obvious that they should keep weapons and abilities in mind when designing new content.
---
Or if you really have to nerf it, try to nerf it in a way where other activities are not majorly affected. Maybe limit the amount of times White Nail can proc without any down time or FIX HEAVY drop rate.
---
Whisper was, in my opinion, in a very healthy place in the game.
---
I support the LH/NF nerf actually. I would support a very slight Ace nerf for PVP as well, but my problem is that I think this change nerfs it for PVE more than it does for PVP. Maybe I'm wrong.
---
Yeah, I don't think the outrage against most of the other nerfs is controversial, especially Shards.
---
3 miles is 4.83 km
---
the fact that there were enough nerfs for this 3min+ meme and it felt well paced.... gets me very tilted lol
---
Wouldn't be surprised if Xur has it in his inventory in about 10 minutes. Looking forward to the Geomag and Phoenix Protocol nerf.
---
As a hunter main, I fully indorse Rocket as the new hunter Vanguard
---
Wait, they nerfed Skull of Ahamkara too? Jesus.
---
I thought they raised the DC cosmetics outside the raid. 
---
Though I did finally get the shell about 2 weeks ago, and now just need the stupid sparrow and bow.
---
OK Guys, Upgraded to 16 GB of RAM, the issue remains :(
---
I agree that most of those weapons and armor had to be nerf! But I think that some of those Nerfs ware a bit too much. In order to make the game more balanced, they could add a functionality to exotics that are not used. Not against the nefs, just saying, a little buff would be great in other weapons
---
You forgot gwisin vest and shards of gallanor, but good job.
---
bugnie is save the games life mode after that twab. they read that luny rift/barricade darci is stronger than worm (they will nerf it thats all bungie knows)
---
Smh
---
This is too perfect.
---
But can we talk about how hard this scene still hits even after End Game?
---
You're actually right most of these guns deserved the nerf maybe not whisper but rather than that they got a well deserved nerf I am patiently waiting for a jotunn nerf too
---
Yeah but the outbreak ship is gonna be available next week and there‚Äôs a good chance is just as good and maybe even better
---
BUNGIE: Please don‚Äôt make Destiny the next Anthem in terms of development!
---
if they kill D2 they wont even have a D3 when borderlands 3 will not take away power fantasy and lie to us like bungie has
---
borderlands was always a solo player game I couldn't get into it, I like interacting with randoms.
---
I find it funny how huge the disparity between the Bungie and Warframe communities when it comes to PR.
---
The Destiny community before a release: lmao fucking bungie ruining everything again
---
Warframe community: please take your time, don't crunch, and release the content when it's ready.
---
Bungie *really* needs to take a hard look at warframe's community management because damn are they always killing it in that department.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what it is. I got vanilla when it was free at BlizzCon, so my first exotic quest was Thunderlord. I didn‚Äôt realize it was time gated until three days before it was going to expire, so that was a few very late nights for this blueberry. ‚ò†Ô∏è
---
[Make up your mind](https://imgur.com/a/f4iu2V1)
---
I would honestly stop playing the game now if it weren't for the fact that I have the pass already and it would be a waste of money to just stop now
---
Anarchy + a box breathing sniper is pretty solid dps already, just more involved then most guns
---
That's right, although it doesn't say that anywhere in the game so I can see how someone might get confused.
---
think bungie is saying something here. you see how we nerfed ursa we're gonna nerf these next 3 next cause we're bungie and we're idiots
---
MOTW.... PLEASE.
---
But i still think with all of the nerds happening they should make guns like anarchy more relevant because it's just a really powerful gun that nobody uses
---
It will still be useful it‚Äôs just blown out of proportion
---
Y‚Äôall need to chill it really isn‚Äôt that bad. Sucks I know and get it but everyone‚Äôs being such a whiny little shit
---
On the Whisper Nerf, why not make it so that the perk only activates when you get 3 precision shots on the same enemy? Then it would still be strong vs bosses, but weaker vs trash mobs and still maintain it's potential infinite ammo appeal?
---
What does that have to do With anything?
---
This community is as i described 177 days ago. 
---
Within the community - not against Bungie though - thats an absolute shitstorm.
---
Sounds like theyre making it worse. Since they had to nerf ursa and shards to make it the same.
---
My mind kept repeating the words over and over. It made it that much more funny especially with the sound off. Warlocks! ..Warlocks!.. the struggle is real. This is a masterpiece!
---
They are implementing all the nerfs and buffs on the same day. The whisper nerf has yet to take effect
---
Except, they fucked with exotics that didnt really need to be fucked with.
---
I laugh, but inside I'm dying
---
Once in a while there comes a meme that transcends humor itself and becomes something more... this is one of those times
---
I havent played D2 in a while, and thought maybe it was time to come back because I want to know what all the Tr3VR memes are about. 
---
Guess not.
---
Just to clarify for any new players who own the annual pass: 
---
Xur's invitations will always be available. What ImpliedShrimpz means by last is that if you did one every week since they were introduced, this is the week you would get the last one. 
---
PSA:
---
Always buy the gun and the armor for your class *if* you do not have them yet **before buying the fated engram**. Otherwise, there is a chance you will get the gun or armor piece from the fated engram. You can tell if you have an item by looking under the "exotics" tab of Collections in-game. 
---
There are two hypotheses about how the fated engram works. The one I am inclined to believe is that Xur's engram will give you one random exotic for the class you buy it on, until you have fully exhausted its loot pool. The other hypothesis is that the fated engram has a 50/50 chance of  giving you either a gun or armor piece regardless of whether you have every gun or every armor piece.
---
The Whisper might as well have hit for that much because of its infinite damage potential. That said, I would love to see it still viable if only for others‚Äô sake. I never really used the Whisper because I‚Äôm a terrible shot with snipers, but I want other people to still be capable of using it.
---
i can dream
---
No Destiny is bad because of Activision... Oh wait...
---
Just dont be trash
---
The Ace nerf is hardly a nerf. The Whisper nerf is complete and utter bullshit. It‚Äôs a secret exotic that people worked for and has been made completely useless. It‚Äôs literally just black spindle in the heavy slot. The only difference is the catalyst. They created a broken sandbox and backpedaled when the going got tough.
---
And the only people who care about the LH/NF Nerf are people who bought it? Fuck You dude. I solo queued for LH back when Forsaken first dropped. I worked hard for that weapon. As did so many other people. Essentially now that time has been wasted. It‚Äôs near useless in PvE now. That Magnificent Howl doesn‚Äôt affect precision shots. Just body shots. This is literally the same thing that happened with their nerfing spree in D1
---
Just because someone has good intentions, doesn‚Äôt mean they make good decisions. Bungie is no exception
---
And me, still using Last Word.
---
The raid .. they need to milk their DLC releases
---
Lol imagine calling Darci boring when talking about Whisper!
---
https://youtu.be/rjZlFswpTHo
---
If they move it to special slot than they will nerf its DMG because Special Ammo have higher drop rate than Heavy
---
There‚Äôs heavy ammo In this game??
---
This is way too accurate, This update killed the game for me. They just keep fucking up stuff that doesnt need to be changed and ignoring broken ass stuff with the game
---
Whisper has better sounds, looks cooler (isn't a fucking box) and is a throwback to Black spindle which I loved in d1. What has darci got?
---
Funny for me cause I've actually been playing more minecraft again
---
Quality meme
---
Did we just lose?
---
They‚Äôre*
---
As this was rendering, I saw there was a similar post already on this subreddit. Spent too much time on this to not post, so decide which one you prefer.
---
Also I know my keyframing sucks.
---
Yep, they might as well make Whisper a special weapon now and call it Black Spindle.
---
I really don't understand the sleeper nerf.  Who goes out of their way to get ricochet rounds to hit?  The only place that is even viable is argos and titan hammers still do more damage.
---
Dude a lot of people who did buy their Luna‚Äôs and nf are pissed, I am too because is fucking dumb, yeah it makes sense for console but it doesn‚Äôt make sense on pc at all, it just makes the gun useless imo
---
Why would they nerf j√∂tunn? I‚Äôm just curious
---
Bungie knows. Probably won‚Äôt be any buffs. Why buff anything when they can just nerf everything else down to that level instead. Soon, they will nerf movement and you‚Äôll just be stuck in one spot.
---
Its a tracking fireball ,in pvp it could get very annoying from time to time but rather than that am trying to get it
---
Aim assist needs to be tweaked.  I can't tell how many times I have someone dead to rights and the some random guy who is close enough will pull my aim away and then I die.  I always feel like I am fighting Aim Assist more than the players on the other team.
---
The worst thing is that basically the whole TWAB is nerf this, nerf that. Bungie‚Äôs handing out nerfs like Oprah.
---
Meanwhile, mention of only one fix, and absolutely no improvements for weapons so bad people forget they exist.
---
I mean, it's literally the only thing it does though. Blade Barrage already had a significant nerf on it's damage (with the added feature of being able to kill yourself with it) a couple months ago.  Since then, with Nova Bomb being buffed, I haven't heard anyone seriously complaining about BB at all, let alone Shards.  Golden Gun has seen a clear up-tick in use since it's buffs, which is healthy, but begs the question of why this change was necessary after such a big change to the ult itself.
---
This is probably the biggest overreaction to nerfs I've ever seen. It's actually pretty telling that so many people are so mad. When everyone's using basically the same things then you know those things need nerfs.
---
Is this real?
---
I am
---
You can‚Äôt be this dumb, did you literally not read the message it gives you before using your spark of light?
---
The Meta will shift (again), The Last Word will be the way to go. Or Service Revolver.
---
The result will most likely be, that ppl will abandon certain weapons or gear, and that is not how it should be. 
---
But Bungie has a reputation of wrecking the game while ppl have fun.
---
Bungie: *changes anything in anyway*
---
People who think they know more than the company that made the game: "dEsTiNy iS A dEad GaME! i KnOw ThReE pEoPLE wHo dON't PlAy iT tHat MeAnS It'S a DeAd GaME!"
---
Im sorry for our loss
---
üëàüåùüëà
---
Careful here, a lot of what you're typing up has pretty strong parallels to what people said when anthem was in development
---
Btw, weapons are absolutely not balanced at all in borderlands. This is especially noticable in op8. It's like half the fun - chasing meta weapons with perfect rolls, which works well in bl because it isn't nearly as multiplayer-focused as destiny is
---
Also, I kinda doubt anyone could beat destiny's gunplay anytime soon. I mean, it's as close to perfect that any fps has ever got. Tbh bl2's gunplay even got frustrating at times. For example, if a sniper was under 90% accuracy your shots had a chance to not even hit what you're crosshairs are aiming at
---
In before Bungie nerfs Merciless too...
---
Aye all us autorifle users will rise to the top and I dont mind getting rekt by something other than lunas howl in crucible
---
It won‚Äôt be on the map - you just run to where it is. There are only 11ty YouTube videos showing you how to start it.
---
But Apex is ded!
---
Ight thx. I just saw it on the maps of people doing it.
---
Yeah I was too pumped to play so I kind of skipped all dialogue and info. But I know this know so thanks anyway.
---
Bruh like I get that certain things need to nerf but damn
---
Take my upvote. I was originally ticked about all the nerfs but I think it's gonna be ok. I just really hope they do buff some of the many lackluster exotics we have no that no one uses.
---
I agree and disagree. I agree with your Thanos-like "Let there be balance" finger snap rant BUT Bungie should be a little more discerning when designing and implementing exotics. How did they not see White Nail being a problem for the skilled player? Hit your shots and you have infinite ammo...how could that ever be abused? /s
---
People don't care about what Bungie puts out. They care that every time they put something out that people like, Bungie says "They are having too much fun. Let's fuck this up for them." People just want them to put out something worthwhile and leave it alone. Think about how the item affects the game BEFORE putting it in.
---
##[IM NOT CRYING, YOU'RE CRYING!!!](https://youtu.be/sEKB7pi1mbc)
---
Other guns were already more effective. 1k, Prospector, Acrius, DARCI, and Wardcliff were all already capable of outdoing it. Whisper‚Äôs niche was doing damage in encounters where heavy ammo is sparse. This nerf essentially shrunk the number of weapons worth using in endgame content, rather than increasing it like they‚Äôd intended.
---
I wonder what it's like to be so bad at this game that you think LoW is being nerfed or that whisper will be unviable
---
So the cue ball woke up? Weird. 
---
I never really understood the people who joined the game for the lore. To me the lore in most games is just a backdrop for the combat.  Lore always seemed so weak in a lot of games, especially Destiny 2.  Vauge dialogue in the cinematics, intercom voice says go here do this on repeat. You are only hero who can save us on loop. I mean, how much of the same ol same ol are people willing to drink? 
---
I'm not trying to ruin your fun, you like it, great. I'm just having a hard time as seeing HOW. 
---
Destiny 2 had some cool guns. Who didn't love Sunshot? But I didnt play it for the story. I would argue more people played Mass Effect and Baldures Gate for the stories than they would have either destiny.
---
Did they remove all the exotics or something?
---
Boohoo I can't use my Titan helmet with whisper anymore boohoo my super OP weapons got nerfed booooohooooo I have to get new weapons boohooooooo
---
I don‚Äôt know, man.
---
Well, a good example is my friend who could barely hit three crits in a row to activate the perk males whisper not a viable option for him. The skill gap on the gun was enough to counteract the insane damage potential. Although I didn‚Äôt like the ammo reserve change when it happened, it did make the gun balanced.
---
I mean, I'm pretty sure this nerf was because of that overpowered exotic. Never saw anyone spamming blade barrages, never saw anyone spamming the shield with Ursas, never saw anyone do anything but support with the tether... Yet I always saw some warlock lobbing infinite void bombs that out DPS'd the blade barrages and Titan Shields no problem without the energy recuperation.
---
 
---
As a Hunter who mains Orpheus Rigs, I hate you and what you've done to me. My support is literally reduced to the point of probably just using Celestial Nighthawk and full super mods. My soul has been deleted just like the thousands of mobs deleted by the infinite wave of nova bombs.
---
*btw that was a very southern pronunciation if "The Hell?!"*
---
Lol I cried
---
I think if those guns were actually capable of outdoing it then people wouldn't care so much about this nerf. The fact is infinite ammo is so much better than a bit more dps that it just makes the others not as valuable.
---
THEY HIT THE ORPHEUS RIG
---
WHAT THE FUCK
---
This needs more upvotes.
---
I figured.
---
I am totally buying what you are selling. And I get the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt break my toy‚Äù position. 
---
They are totally going to have to nerf Outbreak Prime next because they didn‚Äôt think ahead about what a fire team of six using it could do. They are going to have to cap the damage boost. 
---
But I would hope people would see that Bungie is doing it for the sake of the ecosystem, not just to ruin fun. Do I wish they did better? Sure, but I am okay giving them some leeway to get things wrong and then try to fix them.
---
RIGHT?? Just delete them at this point
---
1k AND recluse our here
---
i don't doubt that destiny has a massive lore and story but bungie has done a terrible job in presenting it to the players. There is 0 story told in destiny 1 and 2 and most of the dialogue I hear when completing missions is just downright meaningless. Am I the only one who shares this opinion? I enjoy destiny though. But I've redownloaded borderlands 2 for the the millionth time just this week and I'm having so much fun with it. A timeless classic, I hope boderlands 3 does it justice
---
Titan helmet?
---
I haven‚Äôt eaten anything for thirty minutes. I think I‚Äôm ready.
---
It took me longer than I want to admit to realize this was a joke.
---
Acrius is good against the ogre boss and I use Riskruner against Dul Incaru, it makes that encounter way easier.
---
Any machine gun can kill her if all three knights are dead
---
Yeah I agree the whisper needed to be brought down. All encounters needed to be balanced around that weapon which kills variety in raid loadouts.
---
Join the Destiny 2 PC LFG; they have channels dedicated for certain activities (raids included), not to mention they have a sherpa channel
---
Nobody uses one eyed mask with whisper
---
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
---
There‚Äôs a lot of Destiny lore, so I hope you‚Äôve got plenty of time,
---
It's probably because one of their new raid mechanics are designed like trash they made sure you couldn't use sleeper to cheese it
---
This was very enjoyable to read.
---
Is this not a spoiler?
---
That's awesome
---
When did you realize?
---
