Is the story worth doing? I started this afternoon and am climbing light and really just wanna get into the exotic grind tbh
---
---
---
I shouldn‚Äôt expect it though that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying.  I don‚Äôt want to have to grind a playlist where anything I do doesn‚Äôt matter, I get randomly one hit or weakened to one shot by mtp.  Also I do have last word, I had it a few hours after it released.  But I don‚Äôt want to play like that because nobody respects it.  Not to mention you can‚Äôt use it in pickups or scrims so what‚Äôs the point of maiming it.  Thanks though, I‚Äôm just really frustrated over the stark contrast between comp and scrims.  I had hoped they‚Äôd be closer to each other.
---
Spicy rock on a stick
---
I agree with you 100%. I'm not sure where everyone gets this 15 or 20 mil. I could believe 1 or even 1.5 mil which would be a big maybe. Destiny did break the record and beat warframe for most active players in an online steam game. I think it was 215k but nowhere near what I've seen from comments
---
What‚Äôs the best way to level up in this game and should I join a clan/squad?
---
Wheres it located?
---
You rite
---
When did they ever say solstice was gonna be an ornament? All Bungie ever said was you'd get a 2.0 set...
---
I think it‚Äôs reduced frequency but the whole team can pick up a brick. I also only get one rocket now too
---
Amanda Holiday only has The Red War, Curse of Osiris and Warmind üòî no Forsaken. Great shout but still a confusing one.
---
I think it is a rotating playlist. You can get all the frames in any forge, but they change at daily reset.
---
Tangled shore.Amanda just has red war Osiris and warming
---
You'll love this one then I'm sure.
---
Yeah righty oh mate, cheers for that info, I've been off it for a month now till the other morning for launch
---
Play the story and only infuse into gear you think has good rolls. You won't need a clan but they do give rewards for being in one. Until you're 900 power you can play whatever you want
---
so stupid question to follow upm, how do i start forsaken?
---
It depends on who you bought it through. Essentially if you have your receipt and you have not received everything you paid for, contact the seller through whatever support system they have and explain the problem. If it‚Äôs not listed in your receipt, Google is your friend.
---

---
But if you just messed up bought the wrong thing, you‚Äôre probably out of luck.
---
Yeah I didn't expect it so I was laughing my ass off when it happened
---
As I stated. On their live tracker yesterday for total logins and queue. I even have a picture my brother sent from the next room in a queue and his place was in the high 9 mil. I know that's not 15 plus, that's just where he was in line.
---
Ohh thats what the are for. Thank you!
---
I‚Äôll see what I can do
---
Using him as we speak! At 886 right now.
---
The writing for all of that has always been really inconsistent.
---
This deserves more ‚¨ÜÔ∏è than it got.
---
i like how we cant pull armor 2.0 from collection.
---
When you hover over your light it should show it. But it only lasts the first 5 levels of your pass each week. After that it goes away until the next week. (I'm assuming that this was the "large XP booster")
---
Trust me I understand your frustration. I just feel like with the patch notes and everything getting fixed around that it should be something more noticeable. The fact that exotics and pinnacles in the first place are allowed invites the very meta to use them so being upset about that when it probably won't get taken out just seems wasting. But like I said I understand your frustration. I also don't want to seem offending in anyway through this post.
---
Will this allow me to play through the whole story as if i had started on day 1? cause that is what i am interested in doing with my wife and i.
---
Do not do that. You will fuck your quest. I‚Äôve done this to twice not to 2 characters. I screwed myself. Don‚Äôt do this, this guy is referring to the quest prior to shadow keep.
---
Hfvsh liueh jdggagua zhzhzhzhzhz
---
Indeed
---
It is just a random forge drop when completing a powerful weapon frame.
---
I know you‚Äôre getting downvoted here, but I definitely agree with you. I played a ton of Destiny 1 but just got around to trying 2 last night. I was kind of disappointed when I just had everything and it made playing through the original campaign basically pointless
---
I think you go to see Amanda holiday to do the forsaken stuff?
---
New player here. So what exactly one should do when they start off? Progress campaign? Do strikes/bounties (did my first one a second ago) or focus on something else?
---
Me throughout the last 2 years of Destiny 2.
---
Destiny just had a DLC drop, what do you expect?
---
Nice, that's was my year 1 armor set, except with the crucible shader &amp; Helm of Saint-14.
---
I purchased it on PS4 (and the same would happen if you purchased it on steam and were transferring from PS4.) Shadowkeep would be available yes, but the season pass is a silver purchased item, meaning it's not applicable to any other account. Due to the cross above system not transferring your account, despite the website saying it did, you would log in instead to a character creation screen since you're new to playstation/steam, linking it to that account and not your transferred guardian from steam/playstation.

Returning player here, maybe someone can help me out a botm
---
I played through Forsaken but never got too much into endgame there. The idea of having a weekly cap of activities to get better gear was unappealing to me. I disliked PvP and that left me with a handful of activities I finished off in 1-2 days only to wait another week.
---
Is shadowkeep the same?
---
Additionally, since I left after forsaken, what else besides Shadowkeep is there for me? I do not want to immediately drop money. I already spent so much on a game that did not really stuck with me. But when I logged in today there was so much stuff I have no idea where to start. I have 2 pages of quests for example and accepted even more in the tower...
---
Nice
---
And then used the time stone to rewind and do it again?
---
And some older awoken ships have nuclear payloads on board so if we just dealt with the reef and grabbed some nuke then just nuke the fuck out of the surface
---
its not there. in the same boat. trying to finish forsaken before i get shadow and i have no idea how to finish it now.
---
SOLVED
---
I was an idiot.
---
Thanks for all the help. It's right at the bottom on Tangled Shore. And correct, I have to start again.
---
By off I hope you mean amazing, I used thorn before shadowkeep and slayed, with the new animation I'm shitting on people even harder
---
It threw in the Season of Undying battle pass as an incentive to purchase. And if you didnt buy shadowkeep, it would be available as the silver purchase instead.
---
How do you get ace ornament I really want it!
---
Well give us any credit, the bot is probably using a Gallahorn look-a-like
---
I‚Äôm extremely proud right now
---
A+ gamer parenting.
---
Reminds me of godzilla
---
Preloading was a thing with very slow internet. Most of the time, if your internet speed allows it, it's faster to download via steam than preloading and unpacking. 
---
The download after release will be unpacked immediately.
---
I still miss my Y1 D1 hawkmoon
---
Yeah think it's only one step
---
The heroic daily, basically replay a mission on higher power for the weekly powerful bounty
---
Yes. It's labeled as "Legacy content".
---
I'm also a new player so I wouldn't know if it's exactly like day 1, but without spoiling anything the story so far gives me the impression that it is.
---
problem is that they got introduced to games as things to win and beat other people at. not, narrative experiences on par or better than reading books/watching movies.
---
I think it's the same for every "old" campaign. Go to Amanda in the hangar in the tower and she will give it to you.
---
The gunsmith has a 2.0 version of the armor for you.
---
Funny how you waited until the biggest names in the directory stopped streaming lol, what a pointless post.
---
Can New light players reach the light level cap ?
---
Not counting seasonal artifacts of course.
---
You're stupid and a 5 year old copycat. üòÇü§£
---
Dude i swear bungie has taken such a big leap since the split. I'm proud of them for making such an accomplishment of a game!!!!
---
Everything besides shadowkeep is free
---
Thanks for being helpful, I found this out after exploring the whole place.
---
I swear this weapon is better than ghorn it needs to be nerfed /s
---
What light are you now?
---
Same thing happened to me! My next "adventure" was the Mad Bomber, now all adventures have disappeared from the map. I had only started the Forsaken line a couple of days ago, installed Shadowkeep yesterday and boom all gone.
---
Any changes when you loaded the game up again?
---
On a serious note tho, is shadowkeep even fun? I‚Äôve done a few of Eris‚Äô quests and man...it just feels like chores.
---
All armour/weapons have been automatically boosted to 750 for shadowkeep, that's for all players whether you have bought shadowkeep or not üëå although I highly recommend you do
---
This is why you don‚Äôt do these stupidly grindy quests. There‚Äôs no way that bungie would let anyone keep this for their main armor when they want to make people grind for new shit. Though it is pathetic that you can‚Äôt use the solstice armor for universal ornaments.
---
I remember having the helmet off during cutscenes, a year ago, when I first played this game. I'd love to see my Guardian talk some more, and be kind of an actually fleshed out character.
---
Thanks for answering!
---
As of Oct. 1st 2019, all content up until Year 2 Forsaken release is free and everyone new and old starts at 750 Power. Forsaken and Shadowkeep are currently the only content, as well as their respective season passes, that need to be purchased.
---
Welcome to New Light, Guardian!
---
r/titlegore
---
why that image.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
She has a nice pair of eyes btw.
---
restart your game, see if that fixes it
---
Legacy campaigns (red war, osiris, warmind) can be accessed through Holliday at the tower, unfortunately campaign progress is reset by the update :/
---
It actually has a dropoff which isnt even that far(for example the equinox farthest distance needs almost 3 spicer dicer shots
---
Forsaken whole story is? Max level to 50? No
---
Perhaps you should go see Eris?
---
Probably because the Vex Invasions aren't a thing yet?
---
IMMORTALIZED
---
Having this issue as well. Someone uploaded a controller config that works fairly decent. I‚Äôm working on customizing it in the meantime and will probably upload when done. Would be nice if the game would just recognize controller natively though.
---
try the campaigns! You get 3 of them for free and they are pretty neat
---
I don't totally blame you for having that notion. If you don't create more content you're not going to keep people veterans or people who near endgame before there is a drought I'm sure. 
---
However the amount of resources need to fix the start is hard for me to debate what they need.  A few checklists tutorial saying "hey! go here if you want to do so and so or got XXX to get to endgame" would have been really helpful...
---
Thanks I'll try that and see what's up!
---
Man I cant wait to dive Into this tonight. On the road working so hotel wifi life for now lol. Honestly I heard about the split but with life never read anything else Into. Probably should do that after this amazing moment I had.
---
Oof. Totally missed that.
---
That's also an awful comparison. Fortnite has one of the most popular games out there for quite awhile, while D2 went F2P yesterday. Plus there are tons of people who don't follow gaming news, and might not even know D2 *is f2p*.
---
The way they did it will cause growth to take longer, but most likely the playerbase will start to grow as more people realize it's free
---
Crucifixion. When he was in flesh.
---
eris has nothing to say, and at this point i have completed all the shadowkeep campaign content.
---
thanks
---
weren‚Äôt the pyramid ships first seen at the end of red war campaign?
---
i have tried this, this item has now been in my inventory over 24 hours. nothing seems to get rid of it.
---
Congrats! Logged in fathered my daily bounties, headed into crucible to knock this bounties out as I do first thing when I login, and after the match I get the Ace of Spades catalyst.
---
Pretty happy with that reward! Thanks Bungie and RNG-Jesus
---
I missed the Exotic it turned into that's for sure.
---
I like you haha.
---
...you‚Äôre literally not responding to what I said.  Scrims and tournaments have rules.  What do you have to say about that?  Also ur name calling like a 5 year old so idk bro
---
In the Directory, move over to ‚Äòquests‚Äô. Bounties are on the right hand side.
---
 Just click on them and they turn themselves in.
---
why are you getting downvoted?
---
This
---
It's funny because I too do not really pay attention to it more so I focus on my gameplay and gun skills. Yeah it is def a strategy if you can capture it first. But that's just it, it can go down south FAST if you don't get it.
---
What content is that? Is the story free?
---
Yeah, on the few armor items I have that have the ornament box, there's nothing there
---
Forsaken, the annual pass, army silver, and my characters aren‚Äôt transferring over though. Can‚Äôt use any of it on steam.
---
I highly doubt that people already know all about destiny and how would it take time for people to know it is free to play it‚Äôs one of the top trending things in game news feeds. Just a baseless statement the player base will stay the same maybe add some players
---
did you find the 10th? im at 9/10 on the triumph after doing all the ones that show up at Eris
---
Welcome to widows court
---
As soon as Eris didn‚Äôt respond to Ghost, I knew bad shit was about to happen.
---
 did you find the 10th? im at 9/10 on the triumph after doing all the ones that show up at Eris
---
doesn‚Äôt appear a lot of people are replying to the comments on this thread but we‚Äôll try anyway. I played the shit out of Destiny 1, All raids, everything maxxed. I‚Äôve got the memories thing in my character selection screen, But none of my old characters. All of my characters are default and nothing was transferred. My cousin, whom i played all of destiny 1 with, Has all of his old stuff, and I‚Äôve got nothing. Is there any particular reason for this?
---
Same here buddy! It was an amazing moment.
---
I'm so happy bungle made the move to steam, anyone else with me?
---
Yep. There is no leveling anymore.
---
Wait actually so why is forsaken still on sale for that much $$$?
---
Nice!
---
lonely? she has her insufferable shadow friends
---
Also remember to claim your rewards, a fireteam member went 8 levels yesterday before realising that he had to claim the rewards from each tier
---
Cheers. I was very surprised about Cerberus. Funnily enough a clan mate was playing crucible while chatting with me and he got the Ace catalyst about 2 minutes before I got mine. 
---
Also very happy that the exotic quest from Banshee wound up giving me the Riskrunner catalyst. I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to happen but I‚Äôve been after that one for weeks.
---
I wonder why....maybe its because people go on the subreddit and attack the players and game, you guys say the community is toxic but we are not the ones posting memes saying other games are for kids saying other games are trash and stupid you attacked us and we fought back but nooooo we are the toxic ones yeah sure.

You don‚Äôt know how true this is.
---
Prime engrams dropped randomly for completing activities and world drops.  If you haven't gotten one in a while you character actually receives a buff to give you a higher chance of receiving one (you can see this by hovering over little icons to the right of guns on the character screen).  
---
You may have already earned engrams, they look like purple/pink diamonds on top of your inventory screen.  After you receive one head over to the tower or farm and speak to the cryptarch.
---
On the map screen in the tower, certain vendors have blue icons that say to complete a certain number of bounties. Those are challenges
---
I thought there were ways to go past 950
---
Replying here because I‚Äôm having the same problem here‚Äôs hoping someone can tell us what to do
---
Cool I sent you a friend request
---
The true pvp king is back.
---
Not going to lie what did the devs think back in D1 when people were using this gun in pvp and the were destroying players.
---
It's pretty dumb, hey. They were aware of stuff happening in the Awoken's Negative Space Wedgie, but forgot to check up on the friggin' moon. It's right there, you can see the surface from Earth with binoculars. Just have Ikora take a look every night, it's not like she does anything anyway.
---
Heard it sux, friend got it already
---
Perks such as your enhanced* hand cannon loader doesn‚Äôt drop. Only mods do drop from dismantles
---
Play the whole thing and get back to me
---
They used to be free but new light took them away
---
I just want to know if its working for anyone in console.?
---
New season next week and event this ir next saturday
---
Very badass but I wish people would stop trying to do an Overwatch move dude you can't combine Finishers either /s
---
Rip
---
Wait new light was making everything in year 1 free I thought? That‚Äôs what they posted
---
Honestly same. I tried going back to the very beginning, but could only get to the part where we first pick up Khvostov
---
Not necessarily, the stats will be better for pvp until you get better stuff. Light level in pve will force you to use new stuff
---
BAIN OF THE CATACOMBS
---
&gt;Eris is very lonely,
---
What do you mean? She‚Äôs got a whole ass fan club surrounding her 100% of the time
---
It was at the end of d2
---
Fortnite has 100k right now and destiny has 36k...lets goo
---
This. This exactly.
---
There are loot boxes that give random rewards.
---
Like I said in the post the made bright engrams take 5x longer to earn. Bright engrams give you random cosmetics and you can now purchase bright engrams in the store for silver.
---
I‚Äôm not saying that the items themselves are harmful. What I‚Äôm afraid of is them further and further monetizing the game to the point where you need to spend money just to get the cosmetics you want. Before you could just grind your levels and get the items you wanted if you put in enough time and effort. Now it‚Äôs unrealistic to hope to get all the exotic cosmetic items you want from a specific season unless youre sinking multiple hours a day or money into the game.
---
I played the first year of destiny, and stopped playing until i completed leviathan Raid , twice 
---
My power was 300 ish, and i got couple of nice legendary and exotic gears... somewhat my build is complete.
---
Until now, i started playing again, and i shocked all of my stuff went up to 750 level.
---
My question is, what should i do with my old gear? I‚Äôm pretty sure i dont wanna throw away any exotic or legendary, especially the one i got from Raid. 
---
So my plan is, gonna grind it again, until 900 ish, then upgrade the old gear into the 900
---
Is it correct?
---
I think you get a powerful exotic at the end and the main gear drops powerful I‚Äôm pretty sure. So I mean if you want, but I would recommend finishing it so you can do endgame content.
---
WHY SPELL WHEN PUNCH DO TRICK
---
Man hating on someone for having different opinions what a great subreddit
---
If you go to ikora you should see them
---
Puts some real perspective on the term ‚Äúbecome legend‚Äù
---
lol.  I would so use it
---
Oh shit my bad, I even spelled base wrong smh.
---
I claimed mine and the quest didn't update. It just says "Incomplete". that's it, no details.
---
they‚Äôre still free, if you want to play the campaign you pick them up from Amanda holiday I believe
---
Honestly Bungie shoulda had that big dick energy and released it the same day as BL3, just to fuck with everyone
---
*Tetrahedron*
---
Unless it's a sub where users post nudes and people get weeeeeird and creepy.
---
I do not have it either. You are not alone. It is not even recognizing that I have a controller plugged in.
---
Got it thanks
---
Never get tired of that mini game wasted a solid half hour lol
---
**INFECTION! YOUR LIGHT DIES HERE!**
---
What am i supposed to do now? I don't even know what the endgame is, so this update kind of just ruined my progress
---
You will get downvoted but it's the truth. PC stacks will dominate crucible and gambit. Also pve and lfg to a lesser extent.
---
Not even close fortnite has 100k destiny has 36k lmao
---
Are you blind? The amount of hive stuff is concerning. It's not even like "well let's turn this wizard into a women", it's  more of "I'mma put tits on this thrall."
---
If you booted it up anytime in the last two or so months, it added a warning on startup that campaign and DLC progress will be reset by New Light if you haven't finished them yet.
---
Yes, I've even tried turning it off and on again. But obvious solutions doesn't fix it.
---
No, explain
---
I heard this image
---
Hmmmm fortnite 100k on twitch 36k for destiny yeah soooo bad wowwww
---
Dont little ballsy bastard made me use a finisher in a shank but then have it infinite shield
---
Yeah.
---
How is this a spoiler lol
---
im uncertain how it could be better within the rules of Armor 2.0. can some pieces of armor be better than others? i was under the impression they could all be upgraded and masterworked to the same degree
---
I havent done raids in a while but from what i remember they normally scale you back for older raids. So you shouldnt have much truouble agaisnt enemies if youre 100-700 light above.
---
I got baboon, my internet is also fine
---
You spin me right round, baby, right round
---
Like a record baby, right round, round, round.
---
Cheese rock? Theres been a cheese rock this whole time?!
---
What
---
if only infusion were a thing.....
---
I was with my fireteam and when the lights went out we all went ‚Äúshit.‚Äù We all started booking it. Then my two teammates died. My heart rate was through the roof and all I said in those couple of minutes was ‚Äúshit shit shit!‚Äù I have never been so terrified in my life. But made it through my first try. 10/10 would not do again though.
---
Non broken travelers chosen? Are the prophesies really true?
---
It was all raised up
---
You are correct sir. Think he was just hoping/expecting there to be something better with it since it was such a grind to get
---
Noice
---
I was having dark below flashbacks when that happened. But being a hunter made it easy, until I got too close to the shriker with my grenade launcher. Can't dodge point blank mid air explosions no matter what class you are.
---
Oh thats cool what level are they now? I would like to get my friends into raids but theyre scared to grind
---
Nice.
---
You mean the vault in that lost sector? Hmm... I wonder what the significance of these things are. Cats in the dreaming city seemed to make sense for no good reason. Just felt like they belonged. But now we have ghost cats on the moon. There must be something more to it.
---
I hope that one day, uldren just appears there with no context and acts like nothing happened
---
i looked for the butler and i clicked on it and nothing happened
---
its whatever im just gonna grind my shit out again
---
They were also in the destiny concept art
---
You need to have the exotics first then equip the ornament (skin). Universal ornament just means the ornament (skin) can be used on all 3 created characters. For example if you get riskrunner, and if there is riskrunner ornament you bought and unlocked, you can equip on it because you have gotten the exotic or else otherwise. Hope this helps
---
Menagerie is forsaken stuff isn't it tho?
---
Do you own Shadowkeep? Friend doesn‚Äôt have it and it shows the same you are seeing.
---
You didn‚Äôt know about it
---
huh i guess i need to touch up on my destiny lore then
---
it was an armor ornament for hunter, it said it was universal
---
 it was an armor ornament for hunter, it said it was universal
---
5/10. Shoulda stuck a googly eye on le forehead.
---
I just edited my previous comment
---
I think the stats on the armor(intelect or strength for example) are random. Yet, you can't take out the armor from collections and no way to farm new. Plus you can't just use it as a skin like the Eververse armors
---
Me with no internet because mountains
---
After d1 the guardian, for some reason, took a vow of silence, probs so Activision wouldnt have to record as many voicelines
---
ah gotcha
---
Once you hit 900 you will be doing those activities again for powerful drops.
---
My thought exactly
---
how do I know what the ornament equips to, it didn't say anything about being a cosmetic for a legendary item
---
No, its for people who bought shadowkeep
---
Weekly bounties from shaxx,zavala, and the drifter
---
Not sure why you seem so bothered. It‚Äôs a cheeky grind. As others have mentioned playing the campaign basically gets you there anyway. I don‚Äôt know why they would bother, it‚Äôs useless after you get to soft cap. If they do patch it, then who cares? Play the campaign, same effect lol ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_\/¬Ø
---
Not my fault someone decided to release 2020
---
Spoilers tag.... Use it!
---
Being honest here, his notes are teaching me some stuff.
---
ya just mad cuz you titanz suck at this game. #hunterlyfe
---
Let me in at 750 just fine....hmmm
---
A surpassing lack of Ana
---
heaps of thanks! and everyone starts off at 750 combat power now?

Agreed. Next to zero content of Ana Bray or Amanda Holiday.
---
...
---
N-not that I would know...
---
Just check the appearance on the armor piece and mouse over every *ornament to equip* (normally beside the apply shaders), cant really tell for now since you and I do not know the armor piece you bought for.
---
Yep but new characters have to unlock the planets and what not instead of unlock in them via quest line
---
Cheapskate
---
Yeah, I don't think OP remembers too well. She never said she would teleport us in D1, she just did it during the one mission. And the one where we had to run, the radio just cuts out.
---
If you started the saves on xbox and then did cross-save that might work, it worked on ps4 for to have the same "character" it just keeps your face/hair choices anyway though
---
Cuz there shit
---
Just adding a +1 that after multiple runs on my Lock, I too, only received Titan gear.
---
I just wanna know why you made ‚ÄúEris‚Äù a spoiker
---
Thanks man! Really good to know.
---
It‚Äôs a common game for my friends to push each other when they‚Äôre afk to Hawthorne so they have to hear the dialogue
---
They also don‚Äôt make enough guaranteed revenue as games that just charge for the actual game
---
What are the best gear to get for my Titan? Im a new guardian
---
Literally just did this.
---
*PONCH* LETTER INTO WORK RIGHT
---
Well you can just lvl up and let him know if it‚Äôs worth it, making progress on the free track also makes progress on the pay track, so if he‚Äôs far enough along than he can buy it later and unlock everything he‚Äôs earned from both tracks later?
---
Well to be frank the last time they tried to stop a keep from being built a really big chunk of guardians died. And not much happened because of it.
---
Now add in the fact a new Oryx that taken not only a few techeun but also a literal ahamkara a being more powerful than their own hive God's.
---
It makes sense you really don't want to mess with a hornet nest that could be worse than before.
---
Sure you didnt pick the wrong saves?
---
You win
---
That was my spot. Icebreakers to the ready.
---
So Jiraiya died and then some centuries later got revived by Ghost to be a Guardian, hell yeah!  
---
though his death still saddens me
---
no problem! i actually  thought it was ninroot, until i looked up a walk-through  for the crimson nirnroot quest.
---
I'm just sad about so many people bitcing about no vendor resets and few armor exotics. Its day 2 and we still got so much content up
---
lmao this is how NOT to make a video.
---
Just wanted to be extra safe I guess. First time I've ever made a post like this and didn't want to ruin someone's day. I know some people go through great lengths to avoid even some of the smallest of things.
---
I also haven't played since before Forsaken so I've probably missed some stuff and decided to err on the side of caution.
---
Like kronika fatality
---
You realize that destiny 2 is also available on Xbox PlayStation and stadia right? That‚Äôs steam only. Try again ‚Äúbud‚Äù
---
Check your collections, if you can‚Äôt see it there (even though it‚Äôs unattained) then it‚Äôs no longer available. If you can see it then there must be a way to get it. I have seen not a drop of this set so far though...
---
ok, sorry I got confused, thanks
---
John wick said it cooler tho, right?
---
took two days and first impressions, are I thought it would be better
---
Soft cap is 900 light so all drops will be higher light until that, including blues. It's just that the solstice armor has meh stats (mobility, intelligence etc.) and one less of a mod slot that makes em not that good
---
Destination = planets and such.
---
son i was just about to comment before even seeing this
---
Ikr, you just got to 50 over the course of the story. Endgame is where the grind was at.
---
you go high I go low
---
Believe all account have that cap.
---
It wasn‚Äôt the best last season either. It‚Äôs just cool looking armor. It‚Äôs also not completely useless like the last solstice armor was when Forsaken dropped. They said you‚Äôd get 2.0 versions of the solstice armor, and that‚Äôs literally what you got.
---
I never had this information directed at me. 
---
Maybe they said it over social media; but to assume they specifically told me is not only a stretch, it‚Äôs incorrect. 
---
I am subscribed to the Bungie email newsletter. 
---
Nope. Still never said it. 
---
So they told ‚Äúpeople‚Äù, if I am not among those people can this issue still be a surprise to me?
---
The scariest part of my October thus far. GG
---
It‚Äôs the correct save I have all of my subclass upgrades
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter what you saw. Set your expectations accordingly. Not every DLC is going to be the size of the entire game
---
You wouldn't really be overpowered. Enemy threat matches to your level for the most part.
---
Do it no balls. What system
---
Oh yeah forgot about stats.... never seen the point of them in D2 because of mob level scalling, i always thought that differences in build were minimal in this game. Sure you will be able toget super/ grenade faster now but i've yet to see content untouchable without a specific build
---
I'm not far in shadowkeep yet but for me, theorycrafting armor stat has no interest in this game... only mods are worth my time. But that's a personnal opinion
---
Happened to me too. Just curious, did you finish the post campaign quests ala ace of spades?
---
I had not so I‚Äôm wondering if that counted as not compete.
---
If i don't undervolt my laptop's CPU then I get some boost in frame rate (5 -7 FPS) but CPU temp goes beyond 90C even with fans on max speed.
---
Is this some sort of peasant home that I'm too rich to understand?
---
They put a rock "memorial" over him way back in Destiny 1.
---
It took me a while to get one but I kept doing it and I cant get another and none of my friends have gotten two so idk.
---
Wow, feel like an idiot, I was over looking that the entire time, thanks!
---
I see the quest on there. But I can only track it. There isn't an option to fuse the chalice with the imperials. 
---
I'm so frustated.
---
What platform is that on?
---
I thought this was a mature sub
---
Would you say it's worth using?
---
Well, either you pray to the RNG gods or pay for it in Silver. It'll only cost you a lunch or two, you'll be fine
---
yeah spoiled now. gutted
---
Click details on the chalice, not the quest
---
i think we may have tp wait a bit and see if they add ways for you to get more than one a week per toon.
---
I think the forsaken expansion been the best part of D2, might have been where Bungie actually started the new Destiny that we love again. My recommendation is to play through all the content in order, no hurry. The game gets better the further you get in the @story@.
---
old map same great lanes tho :)
---
Ok.
---
In the quests
---
Hmmm that‚Äôs strange. But yeah it says your 750 on the character screen. 750 is essentially the new power floor, making it the lowest possible light so that‚Äôs why everything you have including your character is 750
---
Fuck that Knight in particular
---
Scout rifle is crucible quest for the season. Need to use scouts.
---
This is the correct answer
---
By playing the game?
---
Why does that cat have two tails?
---
Love it! I have a pretty similar setup with my boyfriend :)
---
Nice! I got one as well!!! Let me know how well it serves ya!
---
idk what you mean. I looked through my quests. I found... quests there
---
Not even try to shoot !!!
---
You guys never seen doom glory kills, those are some top notch badass shit, these are weak compared to those(don‚Äôt get me wrong I still love destiny)
---
It was same with D1. Only F2P I know of that doesn't require ps+ is fortnite and apex. All others do. Correct me if wrong.
---
It‚Äôs not hard Jesus grow a pair
---
My favorite thing about Halo was assassinating people from behind. The tackle/stab animation was always really satisfying.
---
Friedrich Nitschke: Oh fuck
---
They drop from pretty much anything. Story missions, strikes, adventures, gambit, crucible, etc. sometimes when you kill an enemy they‚Äôll drop and engram (glowy box thing) which will have weapons/armor in them. Some weapons only drop in certain locations (dreaming city has its own, gambit has its own, etc), but you‚Äôll kind of get them from doing just about anything
---
Start knocking out the story and quests for Mars, it walks you through it. Essentially they are involved with the Sleeper Simulant exotic.
---
SOMEBODY GET HIM SOME MILK
---
You need to get resonant stems which I believe are from adventures on mars and other mars activities. Then ana can turn it into an override frequency. Then you‚Äôll have to find the specific node that corresponds to complete that node. You get an exotic sword after you have unlocked most of them and an exotic sparrow after you unlock all of ‚Äòem.
---
I really want to play this but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll end up quitting my job in the process lol
---
Thanks you so much
---
It's not a problem coz I'm working, not a student or something like that. But donate... If u starts, hard to stop, I know it, I played LoL for 4 or 5 years... (Õ°‚Ä¢_ Õ°‚Ä¢ )
---
PVP auto rifle time to kill measured in seconds, sniper rifle time to kill measured in push the button.  Weapons that can 1 shot you generally are classed as special weapons and have smaller ammo pools due to the sheer amount of massive damage they can put out in 1 shot.
---
Powerful reward
---
few days ago before the update we had a tab called pursuits where EVERYTHING was (bounties, quests, synthesizers, etc.) so the synth being there is a remnant of the that tab.
---
I really want to play this dlc but i might quit my job in the process of doing so!
---
it feels like a mess because you don't understand it or simply just want to complain.  
---
If thats the case just leave and stop playing.   
---
As people have stated, shadowkeep is great. Some changes needed to be made, whether it was necessary who knows.  
---
Adapt to it and enjoy it or stop playing simple. The thousands of other people enjoy the game.
---
You learn something new every day ü§î
---
Lol! They be like f this knight in particular.
---
I just remember people being excited when fortnite came out as it was the first ftp game that didn't require ps+. Looking at logistics though, I would imagine ps+ requirement is so that sony makes money. Sales of games give portion to sony. Ftp means they don't make money from the sales.

Love it!! My eldest son is moving out so me and the youngest are converting his room into our gaming control centre!! The 14 yr old chose the name!!
---
I'm sorry, let me delete the post
---
completely up to you.  
---
Most of those are exotic questlines.  
---
I would do cayde's will for ace of spades first imo.   
---
Its just pick and choose what you want at that point.
---
What light level were you when you completed it? Someone on another thread said this is 900+.
---
Incorrect. Read the text when you hover over the Forge. You can bring ANY frame now and the Forge will create it.
---
Alright, thx for getting back so quick haha. and yeah, ive tried leviathan as ive heard so much about it but cannot get through it. up to the headshots on caydes will so will get onto that‚ù§Ô∏èmuch love thankyou very much
---
A good choice using the Warden's Law.
---
You can create any weapon in any Forge. They changed it with Shadowkeep.
---
Honestly that first gun we get now is probs the coolest feeling gun I've had.
---
Uh, huh. Because numbers mean stuff in Destiny. Kinda like the stats on half the weapons. Kinda like the Crimson hand cannon. I don't mind having a conversation about this, but at least come to the table informed.
---
yeah but it's not in your fucking inventory, like an item should be. so much about this game is unfortunately not intuitive
---
That doesn‚Äôt make sense. I guess delete it and start over. My hunter is a new light character and I just finished this.
---
no worries, we're to help. I would panic too if my ace of spade went missing. have fun!
---
Yep there now worthless if you ask me. They just can't stop nerfing ruining the exotics can they?
---
I got a quest from Ikora Rey which is basically "do all the DLC" and learned that the DLC quests are in fact still there, you're just not directed to them. You should be able to find them as blue flags on planet maps.
---
Same
---
I found a new (I think) tunnel on Nessus so I'm thinking a lot of the places with Vex have some secret areas getting added soon for new Season stuff
---
Yes, but now it is a free game.
---
His name is whiskers and he is going to stop the darkness oh yes you are
---
DO you know where I can find the Forsaken campaign ? Talking to Amanda only show Red War, Osiris and Warmind (I didn't finish Osiris and didn't do Warming yet, maybe I need to complete them before ?)
---
Well it seems you‚Äôll have to wait five years or so if not forever for destiny 3
---
Buy them from banshee, turn in tokens, random chance when picking up legendary engrams, I think they cone from strikes gambit and crucible completions as well but I cant say for sure
---
&gt;spicer dicer
---
love that.
---
Got ptsd flashbacks to taken king
---
What is the max gear level now? Is a free player able to get there? If so... Then that's great news!
---
Everything except shadowkeep content is now free. Therefore you own **everything**
---
never claim a single triumph ever again, until you have them all.
---
Still waiting for Bungie to add the RKO and the Rock Bottom as finishers :D
---
It appears you are asking a question about LFG/Clans, or help in-game. 
---
Please post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bzjpkr/official_lfg_megathread_v_4/) instead, look at the LFG dropdown menu on the top bar of the subreddit for various LFG resources, or check the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bvr9ex/official_faq_please_read_before_posting/?) for possibly helpful advice on how to find people to play with our advertise/find clans.
---
Think max is 950 but can be boosted with Artefact. 
---
And I honestly don‚Äôt know if you can. If you‚Äôre able to go above 750 then I see no reason that you can‚Äôt reach 950. I can‚Äôt see where the cap would be otherwise.
---
Can you get armor mods 2.0 from banshee?
---
My favourite is on servitors. They spin around so much and it never gets old.
---
This is incorrect. Strike specifics, story based gear, anything from DLC worlds,  and expansion exotics are unavailable unless you‚Äôve bought the expansion. Not that it matters in this scenario since OP bought shadowkeep and everything else is now free.
---
ÔΩàard drive will rarely affect FPS, will affect load times tho
---
I would assume so but I haven't yet after like 6 packages from him
---
You have a link? I've only found a "help forum" which doesn't seem to be visited by anyone offical, just players
---
Yea you need 10 legendary weapon frames forged to get it, I‚Äôd kind of rather it be a random drop lmao
---
Not correct, if he bought shadow keep doesn't mean everything else is free he still doesn't forsaken
---
I finished the main campaign and was only at 850. Then I moved all the weapons over to my other character and started the campaign at around 800. I'll definitely farm this spot for a bit of loot to speed through the campaign.
---
Hi there.
---
The same goes for a friend of mine who bought Shadowkeep, wanted to unlock everything Forsaken, but he's not actually able to buy it. Even as a separate option. Forsaken it's not listed in the PSN Store.
---
Any known workaround?
---
oh NO
---
i did just restart the campaign no problems there, did not loose that much progress since i just started out.
---
But without external help i would not even have found how to find the campaings ...
---
New. Light. Made. All. Previous. Expansions. Free. To. Play.
---
U sure didnt start D1? Haha sorry, no idea
---
No, you just need high enough light level.
---
Partially Free to play doesn't mean it's free
---
Well on one of my characters I've got to 770. So it does allow us to go up above 750. I've been looking for a definitive answer and I can't find one anywhere just a bunch of lists explaining the level jumps per expansion.
---
I remember once going against god in Gambit Prime... It was not a fun game.
---
i am in no rush, i will play all the free campaigns before buying anything.
---
Yeah you definitely started at just the wrong time - brand new players go through New Light which is essentially their tutorial (and can go through the old stuff optionally) and older players are just kinda expected to have done everything on one character at least.
---
You seem to be caught in the middle - depending on how far through the game you are I'd be tempted to start from scratch using New Light to help you get your bearings.
---
its good that i got this up to date info here, just a shame that theres no mention of that ingame (*the worst missions are ones where mission markers or names of places arent shown*) and the only other source of info is now out of date youtube videos.
---
Equalish to armor near the middle/end of the campaign maybe. Not replaced with the seasonal XP right off the bat. There was an implication during solstice, at least in my mind, that getting armor 2.0 as soon as you log in would be a slight benefit. 
---
Turns out it wasn‚Äôt at all. And that‚Äôs fine I guess. What I really wanted was the slick glows. But the armor itself isn‚Äôt that great and might not fit with your play style. 
---
So, for the effort, it just woulda been nice to get something that would last longer than it took to figure out how to open the seasonal XP packages I guess. An Ornament, again, would have been ideal.
---
I can‚Äôt see anything that says you‚Äôre capped. So I‚Äôd say you can probably hit 950 like the rest of us. 
---
As for what expansion to get first, they‚Äôre both enjoyable so go with forsaken purely because it came out first.
---
I would say play through the free stuff then decide
---
Anna doesn't combined them for you. When you have 4 stems hover over it and it will say hold f to combine. Anna takes the 7 key fragments to make the encrypted cache key.

Yea free to play blueberries are gonna make not forgotten a lot easier for a lot of people

Would you ever play nightfalls before with no mics and no premade teams? Lfg exists for a reason.
---
Yea it sucks that people just take advantage of ftp games like that.  Worried destiny is gonna be like that too.  I slightly disagree since after the handcannon nerf last word essentially has very similar range to every other handcannon and it‚Äôs really annoying to play against.  I just get really heated and need a place to vent tbh.  My life is shit and destiny is all I have
---
Gonna deliberating super them now, and it‚Äôs entirely your fault.
---
Welcome to the party, we all want to die here. Hopefully destiny doesn‚Äôt become cheater infested, but then again it‚Äôs not a pvp focused game anyways. 
---
Again, counter it. My better devils fucks every last word I come across directly up the ass so idk what your issue is.

(TITAN) Use lion rampants exotic pants and use a heavy sword and jump jump swing and repeat then if u mess up while doing it use the middle tree arc class to superman your way there

Yo I got on destiny 2 yesterday for the first time after shadow keep and I have no idea what destiny 2 is anymore
---
I'm getting "error: cabbage". Maybe my internet settings but, this is pretty strange. Anyway, thanks dude.
---
I'm sorry that I wanted proof as his claim of 20 minutes seemed clickbaity as fuck? Stop trying to argue, it's all you seem to do on reddit. Catch.

Just cosmetic
---
My actual reaction playing the first mission:
---
*Sees red ghost people*
---
Me- weeeee wooooo, weeee wooooo.
---
*Sees the fucking pyramid*
---
Me- WEEWOOWEEWOOWEEWOO!!!!!!!!
---
I think it might be intentional,idk if it‚Äôs a bug
---
P2W sadly but there isn't any game similar so we have to keep going with it
---
Classic
---
Lol yea buy the free to play dlc of the old map from the first game others paid for...
---
in shadow keep  do old raids  like EOW , calus, and val caur reward powerfull drops?
---
Wait how is it p2w what happened
---
Repost for attention on a forum..  some people really have no lives.
---
Anime finisher, Destiny Style
---
Saaaaaaame
---
Do you think the main campaign will still be fun and worth doing now that you start at level 750? I know you can get some exotics from some of the missions but without the loop of levelling up/gaining more power from doing the campaign I‚Äôm a bit worried I‚Äôll burn out on it.
---
I started warlock but after trying Hunter's jump and mobility, I find it hard to go back.
---
Damn, I'm sorry about that. Yours may be another issue ugh
---
Wish I could record my clips. :( but I don't think you can record if you play in HDR. At least I Havnt found out how yet.
---
Save your torment for someone who gives a damn!
---
That‚Äôs not the ending. The story will continue to progress as the season continues. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll get more insight with the raid, perhaps the dungeon, and there will definitely be information in the lore books.
---
Now I want an emote that will hypnotize a harpy.
---
I dont think your alone this happened to a friend of mine we looked at the forums and bungie may know about it.
---
I really hope they sort it out for you
---
Yeah i know, but maybe somehow they will compensate. Or not haha.
---
GORGON HAS FOUND ITS PREY
---
true , specially  when running for your life in that one particular mission.
---
1 mobility, 1 resilience and 1 recovery is trash. Guessing this is bugged
---
Oh god there's still hope. Thank you so much I feel slightly better now‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Yeah but with bungie you never know
---
Lets make it happen community!!!!!
---
Yup sure is
---
okay thanks
---
Yes
---
While shadowkeep is the newest dlc remember that its a tiny expansion compared to Forsaken. It‚Äôs got the moon in it. That‚Äôs about it. And a battle pass. Some old maps, and some old weapons. I think the total of new armour/weapons in shadowkeep is about 20+? Which is ridiculously low for a supposedly big fall dlc like this. So just keep that in mind
---
The bestest
---
Caught me by surprise
---
Would love it!!
---
nice can you two be my best friends and help me with Comp.
---
Thanks
---
Where do you get it from
---
Hows the bow subclass? I heard it was shit before but it got buffed in this update. I kinda like the one where you shoot multiple arrows.
---
Yea.  I would def buy that.  I missed some good ones on my warlock :(
---
Like 'Secret Treasure'?
---
Thanks.
---
Servers are sad with all the traffic. Good luck man!
---
I don‚Äôt think you want to get exotic weapons early on.  Cause won‚Äôt they be like shit later on, compare to better exotics? As for grinding, it‚Äôs double exp right now so I guess just do side quests, kill things, maybe main missions
---
I was just wondering what other things people liked about the class. I just did the first mission before going to the tower, so I havent done much with the hunter yet.
---
Everybody and their grandma has been posting about this.
---
Nah, karma farm
---
Eris
---
*Karma whore*
---
I got it as a drop in Nightfall: The Ordeal
---
So, is it worth getting shadowkeep and forsaken? or should i just level my power level up to 960 with base game?
---
Also, remember that you can only hold 25 of those, so if you are already capped (wich happened to me since I bought a lot from Banshee) you might want to use a couple before claiming more from the Season tracks or quest rewards, for instance.
---
The story is small, but that doesn't mean the lore books are useless. The story is mainly in the lore books and the raid is connected to the story yea.
---
Ok thank you
---
And you will for a long time
---
Was there also a curiosity with menagerie that if your fireteam is not set to "public", you load in solo? At least some activity was like that.
---
yes?
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they've mostly turned off roaming matchmaking on the moon. 
---
Probably to stop it being on fire.
---
dont disagree but as much as i love the game the time gating or bloated quest are starting to wear thin. there is no reason a catalyst needs to take months(season) to get. just put the damn thing out when we can work to get in in a decent amount of time. why not just put it out then or a mission like the whisper some thing fun and reasonable
---
**QUIET!**
---
Ok, thanks.
---
Why, just why do i have to buy the dlc twice, I can legit buy a whole new game with that money
---
Is there any way to change region now?
---
Is it a boss room or just a starting point?
---
Is it at a certain point of the story completion I'm only at the part where you do the strike.i got the bounties but not the weekly ones
---
thats the big sad
---
This is so sad, alexa play despacito
---
Awesome and priceless!!
---
If you manage to get the Huckleberry exotic, use it! It‚Äôs one of the best PvE exotics in the game right now. Get a catalyst and you‚Äôll slay for days
---
Either at the end or when you reach 900 light, I think. There might be a light level req on the lost sectors like in the dreaming city
---
Id buy forsaken then shadowkeep when you finish that if you're still interested. Shadowkeep is super small fyi
---
I always thought the chest spawned after you killed the Walker
---
more and more come to mock her every day they really are insufferable
---
Then in that regard I'd expect the expansion not to cost $35 bucks. For dlcs that I "shouldnt expect content" I'd like to see a matching price tag.
---
Of course that will never happen seeing as rise of iron was 30 bucks at launch and you got about the same amount. I get they're going solo and dont have a multi billion dollar backer anymore but it feels like we just got spit on.
---
All players begin at 50 now. Progression is instead tied to your Power Level, which starts at 750 and can be increased to 950.
---
If you get forsaken and Shadowkeep you will have it all. If you want to save and only get one, definitely get Shadowkeep for now.
---
Never thought I'd see a BTS Destiny meme. +1
---
Yeah, was happening to me last night. I'd get maybe 3/4 through the fight and then kicked back to orbit.
---
Would you really wanted to have climbed from 0 to 960? Shit, if you did it the right way you would be in blue gear all the way up to 900. That sucks ass if you ask me. In any case you still have 200 power to climb now and that is a significant amount to climb.
---
Haha that was the intended joke
---
Alright thanks man I'm at 855 I've been grinding crucible to also get the recluse even though it's being nerfed or so I've heard but I'm close to that I'n any case I'm also completing more of the story missions. Thanks
---
You can do whatever you like and earn gear. If you want some structure, you can play the Red War, Curse of Osiris, and Warmind story campaigns by speaking to Amanda Holliday in the Tower Hangar.
---
This is one of the coolest things, I hope you really get back into the game they have made it a lot better. Shadowkeep is a blast so far and cant wait to discover all of its secrets.

Top and bottom are great. Bottom is ridiculous damage, top is great utility. Middle is the one I play the least, as its more PvP oriented afaik. Its still good though, I just know the least about it.

Bottom Nightstalker is legit amazing now though. Would recommend/10 :P

The moment the taken knight knew it fucked up
---
It‚Äôs literally idiot proof, you have to be dead to not get it. The Drifter tells you stuff 24-7.
---
Ikuso, Jotaro
---
Story missions are one way. Collect lots of bounties from the tower and do a bunch of heroic public events while doing patrols. Edz is the best for public events since there's more area to spawn them. You can also double dip on public events to boost your xp if needed
---
We have strikes and adventures that take us through the infinite forest, and they might bring back the haunted/verdant forest in events again.
---
I understand that was the case until now, but when I read :
---
&gt;All non-powerful rewards now drop 3 to 0 points below your **highest equippable Power level**, up from 15 to 20 below
---
I thought they meant the drops will be -3 to 0 related to my highest equippable item. My bad!
---
Yes that is what OP posted. Thank you for the valuable input.
---
I think you're definitely in the minority on that one.
---
Dude, there's a *ton* of grind to do that has nothing to do with character level or power/light level.  There's getting good roles on armor, finding all the armor mods, there's leveling up the artifact.
---
Quit yer bitching and enjoy a great game.
---
He is bitching because he didn't bother to look into his shit and set up his account , they gave us multiple heads up and even shut down the shop for like a literal month lmao .

Good things come to those who wait

I dropped kicked one off a ledge and laughed for about 20 min
---
Could‚Äôve swore the last one was Null
---
Thanks a lot.

I wish I could understand your angle a little better, I myself am so glad to get back to the moon (hive is my fav enemy) and think the story is really good, short, but good. The moon while it can feel sparse, you have to remember the whole Hellmouth and the underground catacombs. If it‚Äôs feeling lackluster to ya I‚Äôd try to find the few things that made destiny a wonderful game for you and try to only notice those more. Shadowkeep is so much more than what we have seen so far, give it a few weeks and I‚Äôm sure there will be more to do than we realize :)
---
Still would be cool
---
You are welcome.
---
Yes.
---
In fact, it's straight up worse. The elemental affinity restriction means that you can't even equip all of the mods you want because you're locked to a single element type on solstice. You can't reroll it like other armor pieces, so wtf
---
lol I checked his post history he has 1 stupid question about CoO (what happen to Osiris during red war? he supposed to die in infinite forest? (He predicted the red war dumass)) and the rest is Path of Exile. I don‚Äôt think he actually enjoys this game (at least he‚Äôs not a fan he just plays it once in a while).
---
No it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs completely different. The annual pass was prebuying dlc for the year. The season pass is an account specific reward path for leveling up the current season.
---
I am having a similar issue with my warlock not getting exotic equipment for doing some story missions.
---
They just added those. They‚Äôre called finishers. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll add some whacky ones before too long
---
Yea. It's funny how some people have time to do this shit, especially since it's not helping anyone.
---
I believe I‚Äôve finished the campaign, but I‚Äôm not certain, and so far the story telling has been on point, and I‚Äôm very easily immersed. I wish it was longer. Having the collectors edition adds some fun irl aspects to the lore and stuff

It posts about every 10 minutes, in a variety of subs, stealing a top 20 post.  If it is a text post, it will be word for word.  The following are examples of actual stolen content:

People tend to comment or wonder, "Why in earth make such a bot?"  The answer is generally one of two things.
---
* OP just wants to make a program and see it flourish in the world.
---
* OP wants to gain a bunch of karma and then turn around and sell the account for actual money.  A user with over a million+ karma can be "worth" a lot to people, such as advertisers, that can wipe the history clean and start anew (deleting all your post/comments does not remove your karma), for example.
---
Many subs ban users for posting top reposts to that sub.  If this post is one of them, you can report it and a mod would end up removing it.

---
Update. Xb1 controller works when connected to computer. Does not work when going through steam streaming. So seems like a steam issue.
---
Finisher moves and yes. See the circle above an enemy hit G
---
Lmfao the second I reforged it with banshee I put it in my vault, the grind was definitely not worth it.
---
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all folks‚Äù
---
I tried to say that in a post but got downvoted to shit. I need help to get this noticed...
---
Are they called something else now? The mods that give me more intellect anyway. I‚Äôve gotten strength and discipline mods but no super ones so far. I‚Äôm looking for the mod that gets my super up faster.
---
As a rule of thumb keep all exotics and put them in the vault once outleveld.at the end decide which one u like the most and infuse them with other random not exotic stuff to match up your level.exotics can't be transmoged.
---
The dude can't see right from wrong and wouldn't answer my question. These type of people make me laugh.. I saw he plays Path of Exile as well which I know is toxic.
---
ty.
---
I was curious about this also, I believe gear wise you would be fine just vault it, but not sure if you would need to unlock supers/abilities and campaign steps.
---
If they're anything like that damn rabbit that runs across the road in the EDZ, they're indestructible anyway, which stinks.
---
I prefer the rats and pigeons in Division.  Target practice.
---
I tried for like 30 minutes. I couldn‚Äôt find where it goes
---
I think the distinction is highest equippable ‚Äòpower level‚Äô. That would be the average of all your highest gear in my mind. What you described I would call your highest equippable ‚Äòitem‚Äô.
---
Bungie can be confusing in their wording when they shake things up. Anyways, hope this helps you and your grind!
---
The chests are everywhere, the order is from left to right I beleive. There's one at Archer's Line in a cave. The only reason I can see it vanishing is because of it glitching.
---
I mean I loved it previously but right now... it isn't grabbing me in the least. To me the storyline of past horrors and Erin seems superficial to yet another pyramid.  I will give it time... I bought it and pretty much am here. Just expected a lot more "never seen before" than this.  I did like the starting battle on the moon but then that vanished...
---
I feel like the whole first year not talking made "Uldrun Sov is mine" way more memorable.
---
Yes most of it is used for repuation leveling for different characters, or weapons upgrading.
---
Oh yeah let's go
---
I was only partway on the dreaming city quests as well.
---
Yes almost everything
---
But there's an elemental affinity restriction on solstice, that is a major disadvantage. With any other armor piece you can get another to reroll the element, but not with solstice. It's actually worse! We need this to get noticed.
---
Baryon bough is extremly valuable!!
---
Those were included with the Deluxe version right, the $60 option?
---
I'm just wondering if it's true that owning that one levels you up faster/ gives extra stuff
---
Dunno if it's fixed now with steam but the aussies and kiwi's were dumped into the america region so they kept getting banned for bad connection cus they were forced to play on north/south american servers
---
Yep. Unplugged the router and then restarted it. Not sure why, but it worked after that.
---
Woke up on the wrong side of the bed now, did we?
---
You fight the nightmare of crota at the start lmao.
---
Yo we got a template?
---
Just a word of advice regarding weapon and armor, don't infuse until you get to 900 you will burn through resources. Items can be infused from 750 to 900 in 1 go.
---
Should be hashladun
---
Nice, I'm showing my wife because she has seen me play D1 and D2 but didn't start playing it herself til the last solstice, we're 2hrs and like 4 minutes in now, so far it seems very very accurate and easy to understand for someone more or less just diving in.
---
I started the game iam in etz right now and doing all quests at least once and all strikes at least once then moving on with the campaign to titan and so on.if u only do the campaign and rush through at the endgame u have strikes raids open world events and stuff.what u do doesn't matter that much cause gear drops in respect of your highest acquired power level gear.
---
The solstice armor is objectively worse because of the elemental affinity restriction. With any other armor piece you can farm for more to get the element you want on it, but not with solstice. You're locked to one element type per character, which severely limits your options.
---
I‚Äôm jealous lmao
---
Do they give ones we cant find anywhere else? Because I think I already have like one of everything.
---
I gave the necklace pieces already yet she is showing the Lunas calling weekly powerful drop for me
---
Recluse is still really good and worth the grind. I honestly can't tell the nerf I was questioning when sk dropped if the balance changes even came through with how similar it feels.
---
The Dharug people are the tradional owners of the region now called The Hawkesbury in Western Sydney, I used to live there. Theres a ton of floodplains there, after the collapse I suppose it turned into a sea? I feel like the implication may be that the Dharug people survived the Collapse, some of their dead were brought back as warlocks and still protect their homeland.
---
Again, crota appears as a nightmare.
---
Recluse is still the best smg in the game hands down
---
Yeah,  but after that then speak freely
---
All I have to say is yes
---
Plus it has an elemental affinity restriction that limits the mods you put on there as you can't reroll the elements on it. That makes it much worse than other armor pieces.
---
Forneti?
---
The season pass it has stuff like legendary shard boosts and exotics on it and costs money to get
---
Lots of people saying hit 900 first, I'm not there yet so they're probably correct.
---
nope steam overlay is off. done on both both recommended rolling back drivers that didn't work either.
---
Op, are you sure you're not talking about me?
---
Kids got some serious talent
---
Hi, I've been wanting to play co op campaign with my friends, and i just can't find where to do it, maybe i'm just dumb, I can't seem to find a guide on what to click to do the 3 first campaign, such as red war, can someone guide me please?
---
I'm hearing you have to hit 900 first
---
Is there matchmaking in comp still in Y3?
---
No, once you enable cross save, all of your data, including all three characters, triumphs, vault gear, campaign progress all come with you. This means you don‚Äôt have to buy any dlc again or the original game again on steam, and cross save is absolutely free.
---
That I can sympathize with
---
Rule 9, r/fireteams
---
This is amazing lol
---
It clearly states in the second part of the message that if you continue logging in with this account you will have the season pass on this account only. Do you have access to the pass on this account?
---
So you want me to get to 920?
---
I wonder. Can you still just go to them directly?
---
Thanks mate! I didn‚Äôt get any indication of where the campaings where located. Anyhow, thanks again!
---
Naw dont have classes today
---
It was nerfed?
---
The picture itself isn‚Äôt nsfw, it‚Äôs just alluding to something nsfw
---
Yea but based on these stats you can see that more players unlocked the hunter subclasses. Meaning more players played hunter than any other class.
---
That‚Äôs a pretty absurdly puritanical approach to this. I‚Äôm at work and there‚Äôs nothing even mildly questionable about this picture in and of itself. You‚Äôd have to go out of your way to look into the source of the meme to get to the NSFW source. So the ‚Äúthink of the children‚Äù argument here seems very misplaced.

---
You should read the reddit you're posting in once in a while.
---
But I've been playing since year one d1,I might aswell just delete the post....being a completely missed light hearted joke and all
---
Forsaken is to find at the bottom right at tangled shore
---
My y1 NM set should be ornaments
---
Master of Arms got nerfed
---
That‚Äôs what I understood and heard but since I‚Äôm on a business trip I can‚Äôt play üòû
---
Forsaken is at tangled shore
---
R-r-r-raze lighter...
---
You can get one from purchasing a ghost shell toy at gamestop or amazon iirc
---
Forsaken you will need to buy and shadowkeep. 
---
I'm also a new player however I did preorder SK, currently going through the free original story and the 2 now free previous dlc's.
---
Oh lol. Well you will still have everything you do now as its the same account. Youre allowed 3 characters per bungie account. Your dlc is tied to the platform you use. If you havent played through all the campaigns then id highly recommend you do that, as some activities on certain planets are locked prior to completion.
---
PvP and PvE?
---
I'm not 16, sorry dude
---
I mean yeah, but that‚Äôs a bit different. In TF2 certain emotes had killing capability.  If I walked up behind a camping sniper as scout and started to emote with the bat, if he stayed in that spot long enough for the bat to hit him he‚Äôd die.  Or with heavy there was a ‚Äúfinger gun‚Äù emote that after a short while you‚Äôd ‚Äúfire‚Äù and if any enemy was on the other end they‚Äôd be killed.  They were incredibly difficult to actually hit and 90% of the time you‚Äôre better off just shooting whoever it is, but it was just a goofy fun thing you could do.  So you could do the same thing in D2 with the six shooter emote, or the baseball bat emote, or the pew pew bow sound effects emote, etc.
---
Silly stuff like that is more what I‚Äôm taking about, not the cosmetic finishers.  And obviously this is not a serious suggestion, just one I found funny.
---
From the couple matches I played last night, still an absolute monster.
---
Shadowkeep and forsaken are their own expansions... But if you buy forsaken you get the annual pass stuff and if you shadow keep you get the upgraded season pass and a bunch of other stuff
---
Fucking spin metal
---
That alone got me 30 levels in FWC or New Monarchy I cant remember which
---
It does seem like that, I went with hunter also.
---
I did this last night. Instead of heading back to sanctuary, I drove around anchor of light on my sparrow and would kill one of the wanted enemies that spawn. Theres 3 that spawn in that area, a servitor, a fallen captain, and hive knight. I'd kill the trove guardian, kill a wanted enemy, by then trove would respawn, etc. Just did a circle for an hour and hit 900. Theres the public event that spawns there too.  Scored like 400 helium getting chests as I drove as well. It's a good farm area.
---
My bad? I was only curious as to what this was and wasn‚Äôt sure if it was spoiler or not
---
It seems not, someone showed a video of them trying to launch Volundr today from the actual forge and there was no option to start it up. Also, on the EDZ map over on the left side was a Forge symbol to launch and it was the Izanami forge.
---
Mini DLC wrapped and packaged as an expansion.
---
I did an eater of worlds and it dropped on power, so not powerful. But I grinded comp, I just need to finish this season to get unbroken, and I'm at 4700 glory. But you get powerfuls for valor and glory rank ups. 
---
Which is a LOT of powerful drops. Plus I saved bounties, 3 full pages on all my characters, and my artifact is giving me +7 almost +8, as well as I'm sitting at season level 34. However, I've also played a lot, I've played nonstop since launch except for 4 hours of sleep I got last night, I didn't go to sleep the first night so I played for a little over 24 hours straight.
---
Found it in another thread. Forsaken is at Tangled Shore.
---
If you scroll down for 20 secs, you'll see that this is the most posted subject.
---
So I do have to buy both although I‚Äôve completed forsaken on PS4. I should note I transferred my character to pc
---
Yup. All damage perks. Rampage, kill clip, etc.
---
TAKEN my legs!
---
What mount is that, do you have a harley? haha
---
How the fuck is this no quality trash posted by a r/dankmemes subscriber became one of the top upvoted posts in here? This is r/destiny, not r/fortnitesucks.
---
It was (mostly) a thought experiment.  We can leave it at your last point if you like.
---
I have mountaintop recluse 1kv
---
I've only played a couple hours of shadow keep so far, what am I missing
---
***TAKEN*** my SOUL!
---
For ethical reasons I couldn't include people under 16, thanks for taking the time to read the information though
---
All glory points are lost on the reset for a new season
---
*Salvation-Man!*
---
I'm pretty sure every cod after ghosts has the protagonist speaking
---
Seems like an equivalent of the cats in dreaming city
---
Top tree tether shows resources and chests on your mini map. So, when it comes to resource collecting, hunter is top tier.
---
There's a Barrier Hogoblin that spawns in this area. It's the first vex on the Moon.
---
Nope, just a small bit of maintenance
---
that should be the event sparrow from last christmas unless i'm mistaken
---
Only with a sword
---
If you had it before from the story you can just pull it from your collections
---
F for the best sweeper bot
---
So tired of her face! üôÑ
---
They did...
---
Is that not just another form of entitlement? I feel entitled to have my effort valued, new players feel entitled to instantly be able to play the content they bought.
---
Nobody‚Äôs necessarily wrong here, and nobody can get everything they want. I can recognize that. I‚Äôm just expressing my opinions.
---
So I have got controller support to work with virtualhere using steam link on android. Works well just annoying that Destiny 2 is the only game I have to use this method.
---
Cool find, though.  Where was it?
---
Special Ed Force is always looking for new recruits
---
Haha ya and if they have HDR it's even darker in my experiences
---
I have the game but I can‚Äôt currently play it, so seeing cool stuff like this just brings me agony.
---
when do we get access to this strike? If you know
---
Man this dlc is pretty broken so far but it's still pretty good so I can't wait to get it
---
Idk of any checklist but if you want to do the story in order the red war campaign is first, then Osiris and then warmind. Then you'd do forsaken and then the forsaken annual pass content and then shadowkeep. The annual pass content is basically skipable from a story standpoint. Hope this helps
---
I can relate it‚Äôs sad af. I didn‚Äôt have the money to buy forsaken.
---
After you beat the campaign you get a quest to help Eris rid her of her nightmares, and it refers to them as her dead fireteam.
---
They never said all of Destiny 2 including Forsaken at all that is incorrect. 
---
New Light includes Year One D2 along with Warmind and Osiris DLCs.
---
If you‚Äôve swapped console, you need to redownload Destiny via the free version on the storefront and then purchase Forsaken to play Forsaken and Shadowkeep to play Shadowkeep.
---
Edit: Forsaken and Shadowkeep need to be purchased again on a new platform if you swap and use cross-save to play elsewhere.
---
Talk to Holliday in the tower to pick it back up but you'll probably have to start the story from the beginning.
---
They should have at least given something to us players who have been here since the beginning, or at least forsaken, like a ghost or a ship, at least an emblem.... some recognition would be nice
---
Did they remove Glory Ranks?
---
I think its random or from xur.
---
Are those the legacy quests?
---
Trust me tho forsaken and shadowkeep are worth it
---
cl√°sico! :D
---
So it seems to affect physical blockades and not actually "shields" as we know them. That being said, it murders shields because it's basically a sniper rifle.
---
hanger is on earth?
---
750 is the new 0. All the new content is scaled for it so new players coming in and going into Shadowkeep will still have to grind up to 900 and beyond. Story wise, new guardians are being resurrected at a time that is after the events of Forsaken. If they want to go back and explore the historical campaigns, they can do that. 
---
From a game-play perspective, Bungie didn't want to force new players to play through 4 campaigns worth of old content before they can play Shadowkeep. So they made it optional. I'm not fond of all the decisions they made around this. I think a longer "training" starting mission that explains things (both from a game-play and lore perspective) would have been better. Also tossing the old campaigns to Amanda with no real indication where they are wasn't the best idea. But overall, I agree with their thinking on it.
---
ah shit, here we go again
---
THEY never said that.  YOUR reading comprehension failed you.
---
I'm not sure what rolls everyone else got, but my solstice 2.0 armor has super low total stats, like mid-40s compared to mid-50s for other armor. Since you can't improve stats, this makes my solstice armor completely useless.
---
This isnt an isue. This is what they said will happen in last week's TWAB. At the launch of shadowkeep, forsaken campaign progress would be reset
---
Forsaken has never been free or advertised to be. You seem to have misunderstood something on this point.
---
The expansions Forsaken and Shadowkeep must be owned on the platform you wish to play them on.
---
This [image](https://i.redd.it/cxsmxav2uyp31.jpg) shows what all is available for free.
---
If you did not finish any of the main story campaigns, you have to start that campaign fresh.
---
But then I'd have to pay for Forsaken twice!
---
This is well done. 
---
You should be hitting top of the page at least within 24 hours I'd say.
---
I think the reduced fire rate makes it so that using War Rig will allow it to fire for much, much longer due to the ammo refresh rate
---
No idea
---
Yes, that‚Äôs right. They made this very clear to people.
---
Anyone remember the exotic farm where you could glitch to pholgoroth in the strike.  and i looked for lore on the vertical top beam where the ghosts were in D1 So check the ghost spots.
---
The shits really about to hit the fan in the next few seasons I can feel it
---
Uh, they never said Forsaken would be free. The only way you get it free is if you bought it on PC and brought your account over from blizzard to steam. Other than that you have to purchase it again due to licensing. You only get all Y1 content and some Y2 activities for free.
---
Edit: Looks like everyone is on the same page lol
---
Yep, Forsaken is not free, they never said it would be
---
Didn‚Äôt they say servers will be down for maintenance around this time for about 30 minutes.
---
Are you on PS4?
---
What‚Äôs up with it
---
Not really unless you want Pinnacle and certain exotic weapons that require a certain amount of tasks to complete.
---
No that is why I play hunter
---
Do i see you using Mountaintop/Recluse
---
I heard them clearly say that about Shadowkeep SEVERAL times, but not once about Forsaken
---
Comp is still a thing, but it is a bit different now. It Is now just 3v3 survival. You can hover over the different game modes until you see something about glory and that is your comp playlist. The rest are for valor which is quickplay. They have a solo comp mode and a Team comp mode now. 
---
I gave you an upvote because you don't deserve to lose karma for being misinformed.
---
FOR REAL. Helium Filaments? Ascendant Shards? Am I gonna have to grind for my Raze Lighter again??
---
My only thought was, "Damn, I sound sexy..."
---
I just started last week, went to lvl 9 and power 120. 
---
Now i booted up on Steam and i'm power 750 without any main quest.. is this normal? 
---
I would like to continue the storyline and get up to pace with the end game...
---
Ya but you can do it faster by 1) spamming packages at vendors with tokens/materials 2) farming activities like strikes. Especially if you‚Äôre on a second or third toon and the story is getting repetitive. Also I was a little under leveled for parts of the campaign, which didn‚Äôt help the process go any quicker
---
Talk to Amanda in the tower
---
So people that owned it on battle net have to pay twice too huh? Since it's never free? You don't have to be a dickhead when comment.
---
Pc. Forgot to add that sorry
---
Ok one last question how do I have these dlcs when I bought the game it was the forsaken edition but when I go to play now it says shadow something
---
Glad you came. Was it new light that brought you?  Or ShadowKeep?
---
I know I‚Äôm just as toxic as a OEM Titan with Dust Rock Blues
---
Hooooowwww?
---
I don't get it.
---
Thank you for genuinely answering a question without making our newcomers feel like they made a mistake in engaging with the community. Cheers, guardian!
---
Nooo stop that's still in the game?
---
I think it works somewhat like gravity but im not sure either...
---
Good hand cannons were way op
---
Are you talking about the Voidwalker lol
---
Collect    *S o l i t o n   F l a r e s*
---
Just because they are there  doesn‚Äôt mean you have to do them focus on the moon stuff .. look at the bounties some of it may be worth while to you some may not ... if your gonna do some crucible go grab some bounties for it if you feel like strikes go get some bounties .. i would focus on the moon personally .. then grab bounties for a area you want to play or strikes/ crucible you DONT have to do them all everyday they just give you resources or tokens to turn in for gear rewards enjoy the game how you want to
---
I know where this is going
---
Bungie needs to add more vendor stuff like wtf, we've had the same loot pool for a year. (maybe more by now actually)
---
Imbue the cats with the Light and give them a Ghost. I want them on my team.
---
Good question
---
Username checks out. Pro here.
---
I fell from 2460 down to 800 people. Every game I achieved at least 15 kills. With at least 6k damage. Yes, I'm a lil salty lmao
---
Yeah buddy this isn‚Äôt the way to talk to new players. Instead of raging, maybe try explaining how the crucible and the meta works to them- we were all kinderguardians once.
---
It‚Äôs the new strike
---
You and everyone else in your instance gets the "No Pressure" Triumph,  you can see the Triumph under Destinations &gt; Moon.
---
I played and loved Destiny 1 for awhile. Then I started playing overwatch with my girl and it seems like I just played everything else but never went back to D1. Then I always had a urge to get Destiny 2 but never did. Then saw it went free so jumped in. Fucking loving it so far. Looking forward to getting off work to play some more. Already plan on buying the DLC. I'm on xbox and my gamer tag is: Dirtybiscuits27
---
What?
---
I mean in this meme they are introducing themselves.
---
this reminds me of those games about quiet mountains
---
Nah the one that popped his arcstrider at the end and you just hit him with the recluse before he could do anything lol, but I guess it applies to that wasted Nova bomb too haha
---
There is a font folder for D2 and you have to install whatever you want that starts with Destiny
---
Use Microsoft word to insert those symbols and copy them to your steam name
---
Might as well get the risk runner as your given a quest to get it and it‚Äôs catalyst by banshee and it‚Äôs a decent exotic smg
---
 
---
how do i get that animation? i got the weapon
---
Pretty damn sure I did there bud
---
out of the loop , explaination pls?
---
What do you mean? Like what?
---
The input lag though :-\\
---
How long did you have to stare?
---
So it would technically still be easier than doing it at 750 ish right?
---
Back in my day, we had to build the fucking thing,the parts of the parts. I spent so time on the moon I went on autopilot. War, war never changes
---
Okay salty boy, hope you'll play alone rest of your life
---
I've got the same problem. I would love to know how to fix it so I can play from my couch or bedroom
---
Oh yeah idk why he didn‚Äôt air strike me he could‚Äôve?? And the Nova Bomb as pure impulse I forgot I had middle tree arcstrider üòÖ
---
I'm Confused. Are you saying you have to choose between rampage spec and something else?
---
I hope they merge some of the holographic emotes with finishers.
---
I just want my guardian to whip out a fold out chair and clobber a knight with it, wrestler style.
---
Also, the armor perk to reload on doing finishers is so tasty.
---
I think you get boosted to 750.
---
Btw if you didnt know for all those people telling me about finding a team, theres a solo q playlist
---
Play the expansions. They are real fun. Then try the whisper mission on I/O and move on from there.
---
Thanks!
---
Look for a weapon with snapshot sights
---
You should scroll through the posts already on this subreddit. This question, in one form or another, has been asked plenty of times already.
---
Okay noob question.  I havent played since launch week basically, I had one old char and with that one I could go to the moon and get a quest right away.
---
I wanted a warlock, so I made a new char, I went to the moon, and I could not get any quests.
---
How do I get new quests on the moon for a new char?  Do I have to complete something before it unlocks?
---
Dunno if updoot or not, but I have a bad day, so I want to make yours better.
---
So upvote it is, good job on proportions, next thing you can do is to try use better colors, shades etc.
---
Idk y but I did the electric sword, the spin metal took me around 40 hours
---
The rabbits? Okay.
---
Yes?
---
\*Audible angry jealous hiss\*
---
At least they‚Äôre easier to find than any other mat in destiny 1.
---
I found out that you can do that
---
I giggled when I got it
---
Have you tried saying please?
---
Yes, you have to buy everything again. Cross save just brings your character and everything that comes with them. Not the dlc's, sorry bud. Cross save was so good but so bad.
---
They already said you enter the raid to the black garden through the moon
---
Also, you can buy some exotics by visiting the vendor Xur. His location is always different but you can track him down at  [https://whereisxur.com/](https://whereisxur.com/)  It'll give his current location and the timer until he appears again. He is only active on weekends.

Oh man, this is exactly what I felt.... the memories!

Grinding for that perfect Grasp of Malok
---
Just pay attention to the power requirements of the activity you want to do and be at least at that level. It used to cap out at 20 over would be your Max damage but they made some changes so I‚Äôm not sure now. You have 500 spaces in your vault so no need to be getting rid of stuff, just hang on to legendary stuff for awhile, definitely weapons that you like to use or have a good roll.

---
Do you have the Forsaken DLC? Menagerie is part of the Annual Pass content which now comes with Forsaken. If you do you should have a quest about an Invitation from Emperor Calus.
---
It also gives the catalyst if you don't have it already.
---
They really should name that one. Keep it red bar tho
---
I like how he pops his head in and out like he‚Äôs kind of afraid

You‚Äôre all insufferable?

Rite of Percussive Maintenance

Yeah they are, I was just being silly in my way of showing there are cats on a crucible map, you ever shoot the roombas on Titan?
---
His penmanship is still better than mine, keep that little guardian close! :)
---
I never had unlocked so many planets and character power level 750. What happened?
---
Wait so that phalanx glitch from d1 is still in?
---
Look up shrouded gaming
---
This one for sure.  when i heard her..oof!
---
Forsaken is a dlc content at the in game store. 25 bucks. At least on xbox
---
UGH I CANT GRIND AND DO HW AT THE SAME TIME
---
Kinda useless though unless theres only literally one or two enemies left. Total waste of time, could just keep shooting.
---
Finished the main story last night.
---
Thank you for your service.
---
Gotta buy it separate unfortunately if you‚Äôve game shared
---
It has always been in since the launch of D2
---
We have to honor Cayde's memory and put em down
---
Finished the currently available missions. I belive there will be more
---
We were just talking ab this in my party lmao
---
The "Rule of Cool" states that the cooler it is the less use it needs to have. Those are just the rules

Why are we still here? Just to suffer?
---
You can just hold down "r" and beat the shit out of it too
---
lowkey this looks like it could be a drawing or background
---
Until half your team is yelling at you for using a useless attack in a raid xD I guess for pubs its cool, but then whats the point? To look cool for randos?
---
Legendary engrams acquired from different sources/locations can contain different items.
---
Toaster is a quest now.
---
Not sure of other communties, but it is definitely over whelming being a first time player and jumping in with the initial campaign, and the free DLC. I'm a fan of borderlands as well but came back to Destiny instead of grinding BL and Destiny&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
---
Most people will have completed the story and fewer will have reached the soft cap. I personally got to the soft cap today.
---
Honestly, I think you're pulling some bullshit. Even if you do use a cartoon style, elongate the face and change proportions, there would still be signs of it being the same artist through shared characteristics. It looks like a middle schooler with no concept of relationships drew that profile picture. Even just the lines of it aren't "I went to art school" worthy. Firstly, the character doesn't look like it has dimension, the head doesn't look like there is a brain in there. The goggles are literally just sitting there, not concerned with the curves of the character's head. That's not even mentioning the hair. Since you offer no real evidence of your art skills other than that, it's hard to believe. You don't have any other pieces of art shown.
---
In the guardian piece, you offer more than a 2D surface. You have an excellent eye for light source and shadow and use gray scale to your advantage. You have some semblance of ground figure relationship through the darker gray at the feet and offer depth in the form of the sparrow being behind your guardian. Now, I understand it is much easier to draw from a reference than make things up but come on! It's unlike anything we see in your profile picture which just conveniently cuts off at the shoulders and leaves a white space rather than any sort of background. No matter what excuse you make, it is unbelievable that the same artist would produce these two pieces.
---
You can move your character around the HUD. so I wouldn't be surprised if you really just stitched two or three screenshots together, hence some things being slightly closer or farther. This is also why I mentioned a little bit of Photoshop. People might actually enjoy your art if it wasn't so obvious you just put a filter on a screenshot. Unless you can actually show people proof you really did draw something, no one will believe you. All the lines are going perfectly in the same direction without any variance. Tell us, what is your working method? Which program did you use, since I assume this is digital and now scanned ink work. [It's just layer too nicely for me to believe you.](https://imgur.com/a/jl15mp5)
---
And it actually looks good! The positioning and the crop is great!
---
My exact reaction in game the moment I heard it
---
Art is meant to be an explosion! ...Not a filter
---
Could you be so kind as to point me towards that info? I need top do that quest too, and cannot find it :(
---
Yeah I think that's what got me to 900 by story's end. It was a huge boon to my light level, I know that much. I started fresh at 750 after quitting for about a year.
---
I am almost certain you can still migrate. That would be ridiculous if you can‚Äôt. The servers have been unstable due to launch,  maybe just try again later? Hopefully your friend can get his guardian back!
---
EDIT: If all else fails, reach out to Bungie support and see what they have to say.
---
I agree! I feel really weird about being light level 750 off the bat.
---
Yes, Forsaken is available. You still need to buy it to get the story mode, Last Wish, etc. but the Tangled Shore and The Dreaming City maps are available for everyone for free. Black Armory is free for everyone, but yeah, for some reason it's not listed as a campaign.
---
Red war got probably removed because they wanted new players to hop into the main game right away. Could've just made it not mandatory and leave it for everyone who wants to go through it.
---
Also, this means that every piece of loot you get in the Red War is now kinda exclusive.
---
I know i fucking know. Same. Dude help me find motivation, fuck!
---
Please, take my upvote.
---
Sweating Solos
---
Damn did play 24/7? Is the story long?
---
No dont think so
---
It's only available with forsaken I think, and menagerie requires annual pass
---
So the 820 armor that i got from the season pass is only useful cosmetically if I keep upgrading it to a relevant power level?  And likewise the crucible sets I unlocked last night are in no way redeemable for visual only?
---
No problem. I made the same mistake when it first came out
---
Maybe, I guess just finish everything first and see how it goes
---
Ah, lame. Thanks
---
I agree
---
There are some armor mods that let you exchange special charge for different ammo types by doing finishers. Those are kinda nice in certain situations.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I was referring too: I preordered the basic before they announced the deluxe edition content and slept on it foolishly, thanks though
---
Right! I could do it without thinking. so many hours of my life waisted for a fucking fire sword
---
Yeah, but then you are one shotting most all enimies and it wont get fun till late game
---
Yeah. That‚Äôs your fault. It‚Äôs not bungles fault that you didn‚Äôt even look at what you were buying. And my opinion is set in stone because I think it‚Äôs correct, and the burden of proof to support your opinion is on your shoulders. I‚Äôm sorry for not agreeing with you lol
---
I find the menu alone already difficult to navigate through. The tower, the director, the different worlds to go to... where can I find this Forsaken content?
---
Your son hand made you a guide? IDGAF if it‚Äôs not proofread, it‚Äôs going in a frame if I had a kid who did this for me.
---
Thats awesome
---
I tried explaining it to new players but they just don't understand. I'm changed now.
---
Exactly.
---
Yep, just like that.
---
Its meh at best, do the lumina quest to get rose or farm gambit for a spare ratiins, either way you will be better off
---
I  see. Do you know of any details? It's like a 1000% point increase per win and losses were cut to 20% of before.
---
Thank you!
---
Awesome. So I can buy that DLC and get that content as well.. Sweet
---
In my experience so far it's just a bug with the matchmaking, if you try doing the strikes for awhile I usually get people joining (also make sure you aren't doing the nightfalls). If you aren't getting people joining your strikesi would just do planetary events and lost sectors. Easy and fast.
---
You're Welcome! :) the recommended path is: Red War &gt; Osiris (mercury) &gt; Mars (don't remember the correct name right now)  &gt; Forsaken  ( Tangled Shore and Dream City,  Forges, Gambit, PVP) &gt; Moon
---
No way.
---
Oh that's great! I'll wait for a sale and but it when I can in Steam
---
I'm really digging the solo queue,  I'm just  amazed how they seemingly bumped the rewards by 1000% (literally)  and cut the losses to 4 points a loss. It's a mind boggling change.
---
mountaintop was brought back to earth.
---
Jade rabbit already in tho
---
r/raidsecrets
---
check patch notes
---
I mean I suppose. But if they would‚Äôve never changed the old system in the first place there‚Äôd be no need. It almost feels like they‚Äôre just making changes just to make changes. Regardless of their impact on gameplay. 
---
I understand these things are subject to change based on community feedback, but it seems like nobody cares they they‚Äôre slowing down gameplay, adding more grind and making the game less rewarding overall unless you pay more money. I know its off topic, but finishers to me are just a small part of a big problem with the latest update.
---
Hey, download the d2 companion app on your phone. They have a fireteam section that will let you post what you wanna do and how many people you need. Posts like this on here will be removed by mods. Also i use the companion daily, it may take a little but to get a group but on ps4 its fairly reliable.
---
Yeah im assunming its like the one on the tower
---
That is truly unfortunate. But perhaps it was a combination of code conflict for older assets,  and a need to monetize / incentivize the game.  Oh well.  
---
I know this is a bit off topic, but that revolver that I got alongside the armor I really like, and I have been upgrading it, could i theoretically keep it and bring to an emd ae power level value?
---
Maybe 950 total... I think. No idea how high you can get in a fortnight.
---
Forsaken is a story dlc/questline that you have to buy. I suggest you go to the tower hangar (just open the map when you're in the tower if you dont know where the hangar is) and talk to Amanda, she will give you the missions for the red war, curse of osiris and warmind.
---
Forsaken itself takes place in the tangled shore, i'm not sure whether Amanda is giving out that questline aswell or it's in the director.
---
You find some item, like the mints or w.e. that was in the dreaming city and the cat statues. Same thing here.
---
Forsaken was a damn good expansion, I would do it
---
Need to find the small rice cake for it
---
But you don‚Äôt want people to start at 750? So then you‚Äôd be 960 carrying even more players that are starting fresh at 0 light. Your logic doesn‚Äôt make sense. We are all now starting at an equal playing field and all building our light as we play, so it‚Äôs essentially how it always has been. Start from the lowest point and work up. Just because that number is 750 doesn‚Äôt change anything
---
The red war is still in d2, dunno why the other guy said it was removed, just go talk to hawthorne
---
Thanks everyone.
---
Yep also I bought deluxe edition on pc but dont have access to the season pass because of a crosssave error and I'm thinking they're not planning on fixing that
---
Red war wasnt removed, go talk to hawthorne if you still have to do it
---
Oh, my wife totally  loved it as well as I do. But man things have really changed since D1. It's refreshing as well as intimidating content to TRY to plow through. I've only played since yesterday but I feel this game is going to take forever to really get into.
---
Forsaken was alot of fun. Is it on sale?
---
Light cap is actually 980 i think. 900 is just the soft cap
---
Lol the sad part is I‚Äôve been playing since destiny 1 and should have known to read it by now.
---
Oh, really? Thanks, I was wondering why my friend didn't have it.
---
I truly appreciate how the ammo counter on the scope is essentially useless.
---
r/fireteams or download destiny 2 app. posts like this get removed
---
Guaranteed
---
You mean rediquette?
---
Oh yeah, if it‚Äôs a choice between the two then 100% Shadowkeep then, if only because it‚Äôs the ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù content. Plus, between Shadowkeep, season of the undying, and the free content, you can get a good gun from pretty much every major weapon archetype
---
Ouch
---
If that were a thing I'd totally go back in time and grind those boring Faction Rallies and Iron Banner.
---
I hope they add an exotic version I loved this gun in D1
---
Heard she was gonna go hit up Tyrone and Jerome after that
---
Lol wtf?!
---
https://imgur.com/YaMDxjR.jpg
---
we should be able to do this where everybody could finish the boss as it is about to die
---
except the time I put in
---
I would delete the game then redownload it.
---
Doesn't look good
---
Im in a similar situation, I need to buy forsaken on steam :(
---
I'm always disappointed but I always comeback lol

You should save them untill you get to the cap, and infuse your bests weapons and armor, a common mistake is to use them before that.
---
Congrats, the thing is a damn beast. Where did it drop from?
---
U can repurchase the pinnacles from their respective vendor. E.g Zavala for loaded question, Shaxx for recluse, drifter for hush etc. Not sure if they come as masterworks but the same perks
---
couldn't agree more.
---
The only thing that disappoints me is that &gt;!the dead arnt actually dead they're some kinda energy that plays on our minds like a drug!&lt;
---
Lol same here but I waited several months before I caved in to get forsaken but man like there is no story /cut scenes in this game . What not connection was cayde-6 and they killed him lol I‚Äôm sure they did it to make ppl come back but man shadowkeep feels so empty
---
Buy gunsmith bounties &amp; complete them all every day
---
season pass content will not transfer between accounts. base shadowkeep dlc will but season of the undying and beyond do not.
---
It seems I have a lot (not a ton) and I wanna be able to use them, and I have no money as of right now either :(
---
Your characters are still there. Cross save doesn't overwrite them. You can turn off cross save and they will be playable again on your Xbox. 
---
HOWEVER, you will have to wait 90 days to set up cross save again.
---
edit: from the FAQ
---
Can I disable Cross Save once I‚Äôve enabled it?
---
Cross Save is intended to be a one-time action, **but we realize there may be cases in which you want to visit the characters you left behind**. Once Cross Save has been disabled, you will have access to your original characters on each platform. **There is a 90-day wait to re-enable the feature.** This policy exists to discourage activity like account recoveries by other players.
---
You would get access to the Forsaken campaign, so the story missions. You would also gain access to the raid that came with Forsaken, and also any exotic quest lines that were introduced in Forsaken.
---
 Yeah man I‚Äôm honestly tired of fighting the same enemies same bosses and everything. Guess on the new expansion or destiny 3 we will be fighting Crotas wife or something
---
Got perfect score triumph first try üòé
---
They did a ban wave today towards people using aimbots or aim cheats. Anything you have that could‚Äôve triggered that?
---
D2 through Warmind are now free, so you get two expansions, I guess
---
Contact support and they'll tell you why. No one on here can with the information you just gave.
---
none
---
How long did it take? I‚Äôve been waiting two weeks for mine :(
---
Did u actually finish allll of the campaign in each dlc? Every mission? Cos unless u did it will make u redo all of it (yes it‚Äôs stupid)
---
