I wouldn‚Äôt be making the post if it wasn‚Äôt the case. I make sure to run EP at least three rounds a day since last November, and the only thing I ever get is shaders.
---
---
---
Whooosh
---
They've been pandering the exact same way to veterans for decades. Same game, different demographic.
---
I've never got a drop from the boss except for dyes.  I thought you have to open the locked chest to get the ikelos.
---
I can understand how the grind can get boring. Once you get all the rolls you want, why return to the activity?
---

---
Or maybe the content just isn't appealing. Happened to me with Season of the Drifter. Played a single game of GP, got Thorn, and only played Reckoning for the rest of the season. Gambit just isn't my thing.
---
September will be a great time to get back into the game if you're really sick of the grind. Shadowkeep looks like nothing but fun.
---
D2 is getting less and less grindy. This new combination of player choice and RNG started in Black Armory and has lived on in the Menagerie, and I'm loving it.
---
The grind does get a bit boring at times, but the game is built around it. But the game is only getting better with each season.
---
There really isn't anything else I can say except try and find something you enjoy.
---
Good luck finding that thing, if it's out there.
---
But it doesn't matter where people cast their supers, they'll just keep killing themselves while any enemy super is active even if its half way across the map
---
I got the shotty on my 7th or 8th completion of EP, must of been luck.
---
Both, actually
---
25 man.
---
Crossplay would be crossing between different consoles. Not console-pc right? Consoles would get recked in crucible. I honestly would probably stop playing.
---
It‚Äôs returned to being a random drop.
---
No, that just grants the armor, the weapons will just drop from the boss.
---
I‚Äôm jealous. It‚Äôs one of the only special weapons I need to collect all of them, and it evades me.
---
Good thing I'm pretty decent at pvp
---
Don't get me wrong I've been enjoying the game and I don't regret spending money on Forsaken, but the content is also fairly old and no full game/expansions should be $80. The main campaign and the first two DLCs are about to be free to play (which is great) but I don't believe the two expansions will be worth $80 together. I think $55-$60 would be a much more fair price all things considered, and that's including the new annual pass for Shadowkeep.
---
My point isn't what you value the game at, it's that Destiny 2 and the original have been monetized so heavily and that turns off a lot of potential players. They have gotten much better, but I still think Bungie could take it further and continue to grow the playerbase and gain some much needed good will. $80 for the newest content isn't the best way to do that in my opinion.
---
"Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the cabal"
---
Dang really I‚Äôm kicking myself in the ass now for not getting on this game again I already bought my exotic engram for this week so that‚Äôs great üôÉ
---
General opinion on classes?
---
Titans: Shit in PvE
---
Warlocks: Master race
---
Hunter: Sweaty in Crucible
---
(that's from my collection of opinions, anyways)
---
Popular by default would most probably be Hunter seeing as they're pretty easy to play. Either that or Warlocks, Warlocks mainly because of the damage, how useful they are, how great they are in PvE.
---
Recommend? If you're going for Fast, Agile and Swift with a hint of Gunslinger, Hunter is your class.
---
If you're going for knowledge, power, fast regen and a PvE God, then go for Warlock.
---
If you're going for a tank with the ability to pinch the hell out of everything, then Titans are your best bet.
---
That's my opinion, please I'd love to hear some feedback below.
---
Thunder strike range
---
Rig is definitely still top tier imo still a must pick for tether
---
Hold up what is Cayde is one of the enemies on the moon
---
Cerberus +1 is teamshooting but as a weapon
---
Play the free first year of the game, and if you like it and think Forsaken stuff looks cool you can buy it, or if you think Shadowkeep looks cooler you can buy that instead. Or you can buy both if you are so inclined.
---
People still play the old stuff constantly, and there will be a ton of new players come September that will be starting fresh too. 
---
Destiny 2 is an FPS game, and has always been marketed as such. There is some RPG elements, and they said they will be moving more in that direction in the future. 
---
It's a popular game, and the player base is growing. Content is being added, tweaks are being made. Nobody is forcing you to try the free content, or purchase anything, but everyone on this sub would recommend the game.
---
Too soon.
---
Although maybe I just need therapy to get over it.
---
Wow. That's a lot of words. They just don't seem to be in the right order to make any sense.
---
I was blown away when I noticed it was my Guardian in the drawing, I'm not on tumblr but I appreciate this so much!
---
Wish they wouldn't have nerfed Phoenix Protocol. Was so great dropping two wells every 10s
---
Uldren is a guardian now so rip that
---
Of course it's a game, I'm not forced to do anything, but these weapons should have conditions for getting them that arent completely absurd and force you to play the worst aspect of the game ad nauseum
---
Sunshot always gets me that gun is so cool. Thinking about maybe doing ornaments eventually?
---
enemies tend to stand still or rush you in a straight line in pve. that really only helps practicing against shotgun apes who don't know how to slide or jump
---
I logged out and logged back in and it popped for me.
---
It‚Äôs still reallly good.
---
You better believe a came back to Destiny 2 just to clap them bastards that killed my boy Cayde.
---
Can u specify what do you mean by "everything else"?
---
If you're a stricker main you probably dont even have one.
---
Ah, I see. Probably an even bigger incentive!
---
Yeah we did t save our supers our super meters were all full as soon as the last match started and the other team used all their supers at the same time the round before that.
---
If they took out the useless perks the 1 run wouldn‚Äôt be so bad, why would I want subsistence or air assault on a austringer?
---
That keychain is rad.
---
I have a fix i used when playing comp last season. They cant connect to a game I'm in if i have them blocked via my router. =)
---
Actually seeing a titan holding a Jotuun scares me.
---
It was match point we were trying to be smart with our supers. Plus the other team had it coming, they wasted all of them on the round before that.
---
I don‚Äôt blame I really did this because my car Bluetooth played this add 7 times and I was on the highway and their was a ton of traffic so it had fun with it
---
Look up guides for competitive graphics/mouse settings, that can help a lot.
---
Its a must download, but there is a ton of content.
---
The title screen music is pure nostalgia.
---
If you already don‚Äôt like exotic quest this early in just quit destiny lol get better at the game and don‚Äôt bitch
---
0.03% of players have done the flawless for Menagerie this week. 0.07% have done the flawless with the workaround cause of the bug.
---
The menagerie is definitely harder in its current state
---
I also miss my auto rifle with a fourth round mag.
---
2 Titans regularly swapping Banner Shield
---
2/3 Locks regularly popping Wellls
---
Hunter using invis for orbs
---
When last Orb is held Titan Banner Shields upward to stairs, continue swapping, nuke Mountaintop into Arunak, try keep her above half health to prevent massive knight spawns
---
Rinse repeat until damage phase 2 - use heavy and nuke to death
---
\- Anarchy is good for allowing Titans to do damage during their shielding
---
\- Arunak's melee lift attack (the purple orbs that throw you up) can cause Architect death, this is almost unavoidable.
---
Im terrified now
---
I fucking hate radar in pvp, so stupid
---
I understand your pain, and wholly agree.
---
Erentil is the big problem.
---
That range is ridiculous
---
Because People don't stand still in PVP? And actually fires back?
---
DUDE. LEARN HOW TO WRITE. Reading this makes me GLAD somebody punished you in some way. Jesus man. Figure out some damn punctuation.  
---
Also. Yeah. That sucks.
---
Yep. I got both done this week.
---
So, Titans only having one super-regen exotic EVER and having it nerfed long before anything else is somehow better than poor poor hunters and warlocks because titans only had one exotic nerfed? Are you for real right now?
---
What a b‚ÑπÔ∏ètch
---
Or "IMMUNE" or when they just randomly teleport
---
Damn, that got me
---
101 ways to mess up a dps phase.
---
A year ago I was you. 
---
I studied, watched, made mistakes and learned to adapt to the aspect of the game because to be blatantly honest, no one will give 2 flying fucks and its only me myself and I that will get this gun.
---
I got it, as well as The Last Word, as well as Thorn.
---
Above are all hard as quests that a mostly pve player with a PvP under 1.0kd average can do.
---
I believed in myself &amp; stopped complaining.
---
I got gud.
---
That‚Äôs using 1 ability for the cost of 2
---
Sounds like you've got it figured out, that's a great game plan and thanks. I'm sticking to it and really giving competitive game mode a fair crack. Gotta practice and be in it to get better.
---
Explain
---
Yeah, but some have the compromise of quick info and then optional gameplay to pad length which makes way more sense
---
Oh hey, I just drank one of these
---
I main titan and i wouldnt change it for nothing,  but i still think hunters are best for fun factor.
---
Repost
---
Honestly in d3 super regen exotics shouldnt return
---
All but one have been chill good times, but I've mostly used it for low stress strike grinding and the like.
---
Kills = Small boost to super meter.  
---
More kills = More super.  
---
Being dead = No super regen.  
---
OEM = Harder to kill and easier to get kills.  
---
OEM is a super regen exotic confirmed, bungo plz nerf.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
/s for safety so I don't get downvoted by the salt brigade.
---
What guns do you use?
---
I‚Äôm honestly surprised that OEM hasn‚Äôt been nerfed yet. Worm husk didn‚Äôt even grant an overshield and it‚Äôs completely useless after the nerf it got.
---
I‚Äôm, that‚Äôs a green engram

I've done far to many raid on lfg and have met some amazing friends on there.  Your going to run I to people who suck sometines but just leave and find a new group instead.  Just remember to always be honest about what you know and be the best learner you can.  Most people would much rather overexplain to you beforehand than wipe because you were unsure.

There most likely won't be a d3.

Bungie moved most the team to further d2 content.
---
Not that I know of.
---
It has not. You can view lists of things that have been patched in the patch notes on the bungie website.
---
Your just wrong
---
Sure, nevermind. I forget how anal i gotta be with reddit or people, while correcting me, start shoving their glasses through their faces to their brains and blane me for it
---
But only shaders
---
Yeah I pretty much do that but with a shotgun instead of a sniper because I have horrible aim, but I sometimes do midnight coup (fully masterworked) with hammerhead
---
Noice. A format with one of my favorite Isekai is always welcomed.
---
Just be warned that I may not know what I'm talking about here, but I believe she's a vendor exclusive to an asian server. Apparently she sells exotics for real money?
---
I remember those days, the vault, crota and Oryx. So much has happened since those days , and many of my team sold their Xbox. After all the hype for d2 forsaken we agreed to buy ps4 and we started playing again. ( 5 out of 6 are back and it is just awesome)
---
Hey leave Rick Kackis alone. I like him and his youtube upvotes shows that many do too.
---
I.... I always thought they're called "ads" for "adversaries"
---
It's in WW1
---
Strange bug, but I‚Äôve had it happen with several different masterworked weapons.  I‚Äôve only noticed it since opulence started.
---
I rock OEM nonstop for the pve capabilities but it's my only helmet besides saint 14 which is trash so I get tons of shit from people in crucible even though I'm an average player. I get bagged at least once a game.
---
Building my first this year. Gonna be fun
---
JudgMent At hAnd
---
It‚Äôs a great helmet for PvP, I don‚Äôt blame you for using it, but if you‚Äôre on the receiving end of it, it feels like a damn trophy when you kill the guy using it.
---
It's a shame this rarely works for pulse rifles tho :/
---
I didn't and twitter doesnt like to work for me, can you show it?

same thing
---
She‚Äôs the Tess for Korean servers.

Finally someone said the truth.

Yeah, I feel bad that people who add almost no value to the world at all aren‚Äôt raking it in like they used to. These poor kids who just talk to a camera really have it bad.
---
He jacks people's content, that's why the destiny community shits on him.

I was on the receiving end tons before xur brought it last week so I feel your pain when you lose and happiness when you beat them
---
WHaTs uP GUySSsssS 12 MiNUtEs CaCTuS HErE

I can‚Äôt find it but he basically said, ‚ÄúLOW isn‚Äôt a problem on console. You try to balance PC the same as console, it‚Äôs not the same.‚Äù 
---
And he‚Äôs honestly right
---
Damn, go easy on 'em.
---
I mean all I can really say from being an above average crucible player is play with your team.
---
I tested playing games where I'm playing away from my team and games where I'm consistently with my team.
---
My kills went up by ~12
---
Just the shitty ones that regurgitate the weekly update. Looking at you mesa Sean.
---
These look amazing!! Love it :D
---
(now do all with their ornaments too /runs/)
---
And some people dont want to grind pve for their pinnacle weapons. Literally the same thing. But people like to cry about pvp if they are not great at it.
---
Except he is (often) the first to air content on YouTube when it comes to stuff like news or raid guides. Don't get me wrong I prefer Datto and Aztecross and other content channels to his, but that doesn't mean his channel doesn't deserve some respect. His raid team was the only one to beat CoS in the first 24hrs on console. That deserves some props
---
I just want each new one to have a quest similar to revoker. I still don't have it, but at least I can make progress towards it at my own pace rather than trying to grind out fabled in a season.
---
I actually dont mind him i think hes okay
---
That‚Äôs... odd. I don‚Äôt know, man. Maybe try after the weekly reset?
---
That one thrall has been more than just killed, it has been forcefully and painfully erased with the power of one thousand suns
---
Yeah thats what im hoping will do it
---
Tell that to the titan with 10 resilience that survived my empowered Le Monarque shot

Maybe you should change it to people who say PeOplE wHo DoNT KnoW tHE dIFfeReNCe bEtWeEn tO and ToO

Spoken like a true Titan.  Tell me, what's it like being able to roam the entire map and wipe the opposing team with a single super?
---
Not sure I'll check for you, pretty sure it was from the solstice event.
---
Hey just a heads up to everyone, as a titan main myself I don't personally think Titans are op, this meme is just made for the hell of it, and cuz i thought its funny.

I‚Äôm not at all embarrassed. Feeling sad for you tubers is sad.
---
Damn that guy for trying to make a bit of ad revenue after providing the community with tons of guides and helpful videos. Whenever I need help with something his videos come up a lot of the time and I'm capable of skipping through to the part that I need help with. Why is it so difficult for you to skip through to the relevant content?
---
There are spoilers in the comments be careful
---
What‚Äôs with the hate for this guy? Is it because he does the typical YouTuber thing with his content? Cause dude was in the first raid group to beat CoS on console and the only one to do it in the first 24 hours, so it‚Äôs not like he doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about.
---
Wow everyone commenting on this must be super young because 2014 really wasn't that long ago...like at all.
---
Someone tested it and it‚Äôs a 25% chance to bounce(they set a macro and tested it hitting the ground)
---
Yeah, it's called Hitfilm Express and it's free
---
The fuck? Imma have to start using these now.
---
Laughs in banner sheild

It's not about how long ago it was .
---
It's about how 2014 and destiny 1 been for them

Each rank has a different number of Glory each reset. Heroic is 120 a week.

Thank you! Enjoyed the video man, some good editing, and really good plays. Tickle fingers are fun as hell
---
How exactly?
---
The schematic only drops [one per account per day](https://imgur.com/b4DV1Sa), so you can't pile up stems and go farming.
---
We need Datto to calculate how much damage that just done
---
Indeed I am! Thanks!
---
Thank you, Guardian!
---
Im about that number too, it‚Äôs the only rune exclusively that I‚Äôm always short on/ out of :(
---
Its optimal.
---
I played many games in my life, and I sure can tell you Destiny has the most content I‚Äôve ever seen in a game.
---
I feel this, I came back to the game 3 weeks ago and crucible is painful, I swear everyone else wall and aim hacks
---
Got it on my sixth clear, sorry. Best of luck to you!

I have failed successfully

SURVIVOR OF WHAT?

Wow. Did not know about this. Completely shattered the image of him I had built up in my head

Thank you and good luck with that side arm!

Console or pc?

---
Do you fancy pvp or pve?
---
I play pve mostly
---
Whaaaats up guys! Rick Kackis here, and TODAY, we're going to discuss that verbal asswhooping I took on Twitter. Now if you dont know, an asswhooping is essentially when ...
---
What roll?
---
Earrape warning
---
It's not about being better/worse off, it's just implied by the original post that Titans have had a bunch of stuff nerfed *before* Hunters/Warlocks which is frankly untrue.  Ursa Furiosa isn't even a year one exotic.
---
Happens with other guns too.
---
Also sometimes happens in forges when you kill an enemy that drops orbs, or when you kill the cursed thralls at the menagerie ogre boss that drop the orbs.
---
Yeah, but when Shadowkeep drops it will most likely lose it's exclusivity
---
Cries in void
---
But you are ‚Äúwinning‚Äù. Just because you don‚Äôt ‚Äòwin‚Äô the actual match, you are still gaining things (Valor, runes, xp, etc), and that‚Äôs cheating.
---
People who did this ruin the game for more people than you think. Thousands of players still play rumble. Whenever I start a match it takes roughly 5 second to find 5 more people. Doing this ruins the game mode for people that actually enjoy the game
---
Ok.
---
grammer is a sirname in english its grammar the diffirence between you and me is i don't care you do but fail yourself
---
My keyboard: current objective SURVIVE!
---
At least I know how to use a full stop.
---
If shotguns are that big of an issue you could try working on your spacing. We have range focused hand Cannons now like Austringer or Rose, that you have guaranteed means of getting them from. Also, not hitting shots sounds like a you problem, you could put the time in to practice rather than complain. If you have friends to play with, private matches help a lot. Just have some fun while learning how to do things right. And if it's *that* big of a bother then, ask yourself, is it even worth it? Why not just do something else? Ace isn't even that good of an exotic slot outside of PvP, outclassed by a handful of exotics with more functionality or utility potential.
---
Speaking of which don't you get the catalyst from crucible as a random drop? I've always liked Jade Rabbit.
---
its not and your dumb
---
wOt is uP goyss. Red Cocks here
---
SK?
---
It is, and please explain how I‚Äôm dumb?
---
Yup. I currently am working on it. I also have the ornament that makes it all pink with cool stickers
---
again i don't care i'm not english i know im not capitalizing the i's and not putting 's in some places originally i wasn't trying to piss you off but now i am doing it intentionally because you said grammer while trying to bring me down
---
4 people from last match are in every next match of rumble and i could just as well play without getting any kills to help people this is just more efficient yada yada yada
---
So now you‚Äôre also trolling, so you should also get banned from the sub. I hope one of the mods sees this.
---
And what an adventure it will be!
---
it isnt you know why?
---
because if i wanted to help people i could just play rumble and not get any kills or do anything and it would have the same affect doing it with rubber bands is just more streamlined
---
If you‚Äôre dumb like me, you can get a never ending, literally infinite mob spawn in the Eye of the Dark adventure for Spiders weekly powerful bounty. Hive just keep coming and coming at the boss fight. I just kept shooting hive for almost half an hour, wondering when the shield of the boss would go down, just to realize that I had to do a certain mechanic by getting the shield down. I‚Äôm not very bright.
---
There is one for season of Opulence and I think another one for Y1.
---
Hang on when was that possible
---
So what you‚Äôre telling me is as soon as you started you instantly knew how to do everything? Get over yourself. We want to grow the community not divide it.
---
And believe it or not people want to experience/learn content for themselves not watch a video telling them how to do it before they even try
---
Good times üòÖüôÉ
---
I mean, I can't say I disagree, but with how much hostility your post has I'm hesitant to say I agree.
---
Third Eye in comp is really helpful, along with the 2 mobility boost.
---
No, it definitely does count as ‚Äòwinning‚Äô. You are gaining things from it using ways the game doesn‚Äôt permit. You can sent as much as you want but that is cheating.
---
Wait what are you on?
---
I looked up a guide I 'm not critisizing them I'm just acknowledging them.
---
Everything. My partner plays hunter and never dies
---
No Rick definitely beat both of those exact same comments.
---
I think the idea was to put the Warlock text over Dr Strange and the rest of the sorcerers, which makes perfect sense.
---
FF7 blew up because there weren't many JRPGs on the Western market back then + it had a really cool aesthetic and story. FF games are definitely extremely monotone gameplay wise, same goes for TES or Witcher or really any modern RPG tho.
---
yes pls that would be great thanks

The Titan is wearing the full Scourge of the Past set with the Bloody Tooth shader, the Hunter is wearing the COS set with I believe one of the new Crucible shaders and the Warlock is wearing a Dreaming City set with SunBracers and Amethyst Veil.
---
this hit me  in the feels :(
---
That scope tells me he doesn‚Äôt snipe often as well.
---
That comeback was just awkward
---
You need both forsaken and the pass to get austringer.

its not I posted it earlier but for some reason the image didnt show until you clicked on the post you can see it if you look at my post history
---
I can relate .
---
Never fight a land war on the moon.
---
Nah, this is more like Venus in D1.
---
I use it a lot when soloing.  It works great for taking down shielded or high health enemies.
---
You see some of them fighting in the first mission.
---
I wasn‚Äôt saying you were wrong about the video lengths? Thanks for the screenshot though? 
---
For a guy who doesn‚Äôt care, it‚Äôs nice to see you put in the effort to prove something I wasn‚Äôt disputing. 
---
Point is, people are dumb to keep criticizing a dude about something. Even based on your screenshot, 300K people don‚Äôt care about it. Using your example, dattos video should be longer so he gets paid for it. Even if it‚Äôs just ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done, here are 3 minutes of me using the gun.‚Äù  
---
As much as people want to bag on content creators, so many people use them as a resource. I‚Äôve watched dattos videos so much in the past for help. He should get something in return. And if that means making your video 10+ minutes, who cares? Why should they work for you for free just because you‚Äôre too lazy/dumb to figure something out for yourself?
---
Biggest thing for sniping is learning where head level is. Also find your sensitivity. I play on 7 which is nice because I can make small adjustments quickly. Hard scoping is a good way to get into sniping, but never stay scoped in too long. As for exotics, if you have TLW I find it to be a primary when using a sniper. Otherwise I use outbreak. Hopefully these tips help
---
Midnight coup is still one if the best PvE hand Cannons in the game if you can find groups to do the leviathan raid to try to get it. It's also good for pvp, especially on PC.
---
The ikelos hand cannon is decent for console pvp in the energy slot.
---
Striker shoulder charge hits multiple people. Arc explosion. And can be used infinitely with Skullfort.
---
All Tempest has is some range. Harder to pull off, slightly more range, but no exotic for infinite melee
---
I managed 130 kills 0 deaths in a gambit that went into sudden death. i want to say I had 2 guardian kills, but it‚Äôs been a wile
---
shaxx is why I still play Crucible
---
Still salty about well being bugged D1 Titan bubble...
---
I like myelin more than Byf- Byf will say a lot of wrong or what ends up being wrong and not give a correction much less credit to who was right.
---
Ok so Rick Kackis films so naked guy
---
That's 1pm est so there's still time to wait
---
They‚Äôre pretty decent
---
Why oathkeepers? The goal of the bow is to release as soon as it is drawn. Otherwise you are missing out on the exotic perk. Do oathkeepers do something else besides allow you to keep a bow drawn indefinitely?
---
You can find people to play with using the [LFG megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bzjpkr/official_lfg_megathread_v_4/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=destiny2&amp;utm_content=t5_2we4j) linked at the top of this subreddit. People recruit in the comments, and the post itself has links to a variety of places to find teams.

Thank you

I don't criticize low players either im just acknowledging them
---
Yeah...
---
Now that you mention it....it does!
---
Okay cool. Guess I'll just an eye out for em. Thanks mate
---
bungie doesn‚Äôt care about your academic schedule, if you don‚Äôt have the time to play then don‚Äôt play
---
I started out hating Crucible in D1 at first but with enough practice learned to fine tune my play style. Now I practically annoy my friends with how often I suggest limbering up in pvp. Ophidian Aspects (Warlock gauntlets) helped me out a lot and first with developing crispy muscle-response. Eventually it‚Äôll be second nature for you to switch to sidearm/shotty/smg/Cerberus when going into confined spaces and immediately popping to your complimentary weapon when tracking out of them, stuff like that. If you see a blueberry or two running off in a direction or pursuing a fight, track behind them as best you can or sprint off to where you can be perpendicular and cut off their target. Don‚Äôt sleep on modding your gear/weapons- you‚Äôd think it‚Äôd go w/o saying but there are tons out there who leave out an essential perk.
---
Cammycakes and TrueVanguard put up some great tips and demonstrate some great methods in pvp, TV even plays both pc and console and wrecks faces on both. Cammy puts up videos of experimental load outs that many would consider to be non-meta and caves in skulls. Fun to emulate and tinker the kit to your own style. Video [example ](https://youtu.be/k-sG7Cj0nHs) , the real-time commentary is great as well. Both of these players dabble in all subclasses which I love to see. Biggest takeaway I learned from them was knowing when to push a fight and when to Blink outta that dumpster fire.
---
They‚Äôre weekly bounties
---
Certainly seems you've got the pedagogue act down pat.
---
Hardest part it probably gonna be the signs and lost sector symbols cause....thats not necessarily easy
---
Well I had no one to play the game with so I couldn‚Äôt do raids or anything like that unfortunately but Ik what u mean and I didn‚Äôt phrase my cry for friends properly I was just mostly looking for people to play with so I can get back into the game even tho I don‚Äôt have the expansions because a lot of people don‚Äôt wanna bother playing with me due to the fact that I don‚Äôt have the latest expansions
---
Whats so special about seventh column i wasnt even trying and i got it
---
*VAaaaaaaaROOOOOOOOOOOOoooom*
---
Bwaaaaaaa buuuh  Buuh buhhh
---
Danggg I really want it lol
---
Buffs for PvE would be appreciated though
---
A friend was working on this and just needed the Braytech Osprey. When Strange Terrain came back up in rotation he grinded for days to no avail. I said I'd help him out and joined his fireteam.
---
In a single play session, by the time he got his one to drop, I had gotten three. This game feeds on pain.
---
*Bwaaaaaaa buuuuuuh buuuuuuh buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhh*
---
Happens ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yeah, I personally don't care that Kackis' content style is the tried and true "10 minutes or bust". I don't watch his content, lol. 
---
But how exactly is it dumb for the actual and potential viewers of Kackis' content to tell him what they don't like about it?
---
Kackis' goal is to get people to watch and the criticism is telling him what they don't like about it. So if he acts on the criticism, wouldn't that increase his viewership and get him more money?
---
And yes I covered up 4 cause it wasn‚Äôt made by them
---
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre pulling ahead‚Äù shaxx the match started 14 seconds ago cmon man
---
The new shadowkeep expansion includes forsaken, I have no idea what you're bitching about.
---
Please tell me this is real and that there is a source about it
---
Nope just hive pineapples
---
But I don't understand, the thing that made it special was being able to equip it in the first slot in D1 so you could run two special weps. In D2 you can just do that outright
---
I love byf, but I've always wished vaati would make destiny lore vids.
---
He he protecc
---
He attacc
---
But most importantly, he think the MIDA a snacc
---
So if I get shadowkeep without forsaken I can just grind to new light level with going through forsaken?
---
Its slot aside it was a lot of fun with that ads speed and the iron sights, plus to make it special in D2 they could make it a white ammo
---
# FOUGHT LIKE A TRUE TITAN OF THE FIRST PILLA
---
I feel like the ‚ÄúPrimary special weapon‚Äù gimmick that NLB and Universal Remote filled are nullified by the new weapon system introduced in Forsaken. It would need something to justify running it over something like Beloved or Revoker.
---
I do miss the gun though, and it would be fun to have it back
---
Congratulations!!!!
---
Niflheim FROOOOOOST
---
If you read the lore drifter worked with the vanguard, it wasn‚Äôt drifter vs vanguard, it was anour vs drifter and vanguard
---
it means death i think i need to look up my hive runes
---
Okay
---
But the important thing is at the end of the day all the Titans cry because they can't punch the boss because they didn't get invited so they drink and fist fight each other in the crucible with shaxx
---
did you read what I said?
---
you are very clearly a hunter and stay away from sentinel i am a warlock but that means i know the pain of having a super nerfed into uselessness how would you like it if celestial got a 50% damage nerf or arc staff a 20% damage nerf
---
Na I can't stand the nerfing and hunting weapons that takes hours to complete. Not to sound harsh or anything, but I have a family now so I don't have that time to play games more then 1-2h at a time (1-2 times a week).
---
Doesn't the mida have a compass or dial that sticks out of it above the trigger guard

oooOOOOOOOHHHH OOOOOOOOOHHH OOOOOOHHH
---
while maul has a lot of dps it doesn't work on 90% percent of the bosses
---
missile is a joke dps wise it is 15 compared to slowvas 20 and that is if all aftershocks hit
---
What?? Slug shotguns are amazing, and in my opinion snipers on console are actually kind of broken with the amount of aim assist they have. Some snipers I've used literally track a target's head without me even touching the right stick
---
I like it. Helps to have reload boosting arms to get the most out of kill clip though.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs fair tbh year 1 us mega shit but they‚Äôd still have to pay for forsaken, if you ask me it‚Äôs a marketing tactic
---
assuming it works similar to how Forsaken did, the game will probably give you some missions that will give you gear at the relevant level as the reward
---
Do you live under a rock? Go on any company website. It‚Äôll all be the same kind of stuff
---
Another one FUCKING EATS the dust!
---
Mate I‚Äôll be all over borderlands by then

I see you‚Äôre a man of culture with that tractor cannon

Fusions shouldn't be treated like shotguns because they're far from it, they're rifles that shoot a burst of bolts, they don't have a "spread" because if you control the recoil pattern every bolt will hit roughly the same place no matter what range you're at

He has 300K plus views on that 14 minute thorn video   I think he‚Äôs fine. From my understanding, YouTube doesn‚Äôt pay out videos under 10 minutes. So he could have the best video ever, and all of the destiny community loves it, but he will get nothing from YouTube.

Thanks!!!

Yeah, and OP's scope broke

This was posted twice already in the last couple of weeks. Og
---
Zoom in on the fourth panel
---
o no
---
You just sound salty, while destiny itself is very far from balanced, titans virtually never have any advantages over the other classes and when they're broken they just get nerfed into the ground and if a couple actually potent supers are too much it just shows that you dont actually care about balance
---
For menagerie last week I ran GG bottom with celestial to take out shields of the boss. Celestial is pretty useful in a lot of situations, but you can find a lot of uses for a lot of exotics.
---
Yes it will be for the new players that that‚Äôs all they‚Äôll have to buy that and moons haunted dlc
---
I‚Äôm missing the same one, been looking since y1
---
Being that far behind though would solve the issue of no content to play through right?
---
Understandable. Personally i like hunting for weapons
---
I personally like call of duty style radar. People shot up when they shoot

It's a cheap foam one lol. But it looks cool and that's all that matters

Ah, ok

It‚Äôs worse in that aspect sure. But once the perk is active it‚Äôs way better than recluse with its perk active.
---
What does it mean by 'backwards'?
---
Its the same posts every once in a while and most of them seem to be looking for hardcore players
---
Maybe the Taken Ogre from last wish? I‚Äôve never really looked at it that closely
---
IDK if this is related, but I've had the same thing (albeit only like 6-8) happen with the throwing-orbs on the Menagerie Ogre boss fight.  Pop the first pair of cursed thrall with Fighting Lion and get a handful of orbs to chuck at the boss's shield.
---
I've seen this pic several times already and every time I see it I'm about to cry :'( It's so true.

You could find or make a resource pack with low sector logos on the blocks.

There's no new pinnacle weapons until September when the next season starts. But to answer your question, no the bounty stays until you complete it

I can try using banners, the one that isnt going to be hard is the lost sector banner in the church right below devrim

Advertisers pay out per click or per 30 seconds watched.

Videos under 10 minutes just can't have the mid-roll ads, the ads that play in the middle.

True, but recluse can have a minor spec mod and if I‚Äôm not mistaken (I don‚Äôt actually have tarrabah) the perk can‚Äôt last forever, unlike recluse

I‚Äôve been around since halo 2 but I didn‚Äôt play y1 d1 because I was upset at them for leaving being young I didn‚Äôt know why but when I played ttk I was hooked

*"Take our jobs, if you dare.

Bungie‚Äôs horizons are filled with opportunity. If you want to join us on our enduring quest of World Domination, browse our career opportunities."*
---
*"Just like superheroes and sports teams, we can be dangerously specific about the symbols people use to identify us"*
---
https://www.bungie.net/en/AboutUs/Index#!page=index
---
I've never seen any other company talk about themselves in a similar way, even when they pretend it's not totally serious. 
---
Add to that the fact these people love listening to themselves so much that they have to release a vidoc for every single fart someone is releasing within their office space, or their constant ignoring of their customers (infusion cores, Eververse and whatnot), the track record of repeated lies towards players, and I think "full of themselves" is a pretty accurate and rather tame description of their mindset.
---
It‚Äôs easy to call me salty but you didn‚Äôt try and repute anything I said in the post. Potent isn‚Äôt the word id use to describe striker titan.
---
Don't think that's true, it's a stand-alone expansion, they're making everything a la carte (xpacs + seasons, though I think Forsaken seasons are just bundled with Forsaken)
---
https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/destiny-2-will-move-to-steam-go-free-to-play/
---
&gt;Shadowkeep will be a standalone expansion, which means that Destiny 2 players will only need the base game if they want to purchase it. They will not need to have bought the previous expansions, namely Curse of Osiris, Warmind, and Forsaken, to enjoy Shadowkeep. Moving forward, Bungie will allow players to choose the updates that they want to buy, instead of requiring them to commit to an annual pass.

This post is entirely for pvp balance.

---
PvP gear from Levi? Ehhh, I can't think of anything really. Both those weapons I listed are okay but there are better PvP pulses and hand cannons out there.
---
I hope this ‚ÄúNobody:‚Äù thing dies sometime soon.
---
wow that's really amazing.
---
I thought console had its own thing where FPS was dropped down deliberately to have faster loading capacity or something.... right?
---
I am on console too. (Are you on PS4?) I would normally have agreed that Comp is not that bad, in fact, at the lower levels, people were kind of bad at the game, so it was easy for me to hop on a long winstreak and reach somewhere close to 1000 Glory points, but upon reaching that threshold, I hit a brick wall, and I am now kind of stuck at 1500. I suddenly noticed that more people were using meta loadouts (fusion rifles, snipers, Revoker, Austringer, etc.) and that coordinated groups (4 stacks) were way more common, and usually stomped over my team. Tryharding is also way more common in here, to the point where it sometimes feels like Y1's teamshooting and corner-peeking all over again, except with more nonsense. I have played quite a lot of games and I am starting to get tired, especially when I see an AFK, or I see 2 games in a row where I start with only one teammate, or when people casually leave for no reason... I also can't understand whatever those who already have Recluse/Revoker are doing in the playlist, even more so if they aren't grinding Mountaintop.

pvp and pve balance work together otherwise you get a novawarp scenario
---
So basically, you‚Äôre view of of year 1 is mostly of the launch so that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre complaining because you think your friends won‚Äôt enjoy year 1  and you want forsaken to be added on, which you know for a fact is good since you actually played it.

I'm sorry

You do have to hit 50. I had a lock I had to level up first.
---
TLW only requires a 0.5 **KDA.**  That's Kills + Assists / Deaths.  You only have to put one bullet into someone your teammates are killing every other life to not lose progress.
---
both pve and PvP or a roll that's good for pve and then a different roll for PvP?
---
it only fits the kingsfall ogre tho
---
**KDA** which makes this even more incomprehensible.  Just **one bullet** into a target his teammates are killing, **every other life**.
---
Thanks!
---
Yes it is.
---
Love drugs
---
I did this last month. I feel your pain.

Hey denying heavy to the enemy team is quite valuable in itself, that's what I do if  I know I won't get a kill with the rest

All pinnacle weapon quests stay. If you want to get a feel for what season changes mean, I have [these](https://old.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/avz648/a_list_of_everything_disappearing_with_the_season/) two [past posts](https://old.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bp0vzv/a_list_of_everything_disappearing_when_the_new/). The only thing I missed was the Allegiance quest weekly rewards changing to a one time reward.
---
YaYEEEEEEET
---
They have to be level 50 and be done with Forsaken.
---
For pve only I'd recommend the new beloved with no distractions and fourth times the charm with alloy mags for PvP there are a lot more choices though but primarily you want snapshots with either high range for bullet magnetism or high handling for fast weapon switching and quickly adsing
---
yea actually a good one for pvp then a good roll for pve

Weren't shaxx and zavala both learning under Saladin though? I guess he would be used to shaxx's behaviour

Have you seen Golgoroth. It looks like a purple-yellow-white-red mix. Also it doesn‚Äôt look like a demogorgon.

I can say the same thing

Also true, but the minor spec mod still doesn‚Äôt boost its damage enough to be the same as tarrabah, and can‚Äôt activate at all unless getting kills, where with tarrabah it activates by just doing damage and taking damage and also lasts much longer while dealing continuous damage.

Agreed

Well i wouldn't say broken personally close sure but being such a large target makes it rather easy to be gunned down by a couple coordinated enemies (only takes one LOW lmao) and heavy or another super conversely a comparably mobile super such as spectral blades is capable of similar feats and can turn invisible.
---
I do agree with a balance though such as the shoulder charges taking a bit more energy and not giving just as much back

Same here

For pve, all 4 of the exotic sniper rifles have their uses. Borealis and Whisper are more niche, but DARCI and Izanagi's Burden are great choices. 
---
For legendary snipers, I recommend a rapid fire sniper. They do the highest DPS. Perks that refund ammo such as triple tap are good, as well as rapid hit.

also ah yes the guy with a 1.12 kd and as best weapon super

Best weapon? I'm not saying I'm an amazing player but don't lie about yourself on the internet

[https://destinytracker.com/d2/profile/psn/Shadowhawk0496/detailed](https://destinytracker.com/d2/profile/psn/Shadowhawk0496/detailed) it says it right here super
---
also besides you having played more crucible games and having a slightly higher kd our stats are near identical
---
Ms Obama get down
---
A jotunn oneshotted me further away
---
What's that supposed to mean.?
---
I was like this except I was a titan in D1 and started as hunter I. D2 then tried warlock and main warlock now
---
I‚Äôll add you, even though I‚Äôm not in this convo, I can heavily relate. I haven‚Äôt finished a single d2 Raid or attempted any since leviathan cane out
---
Nice

You could try maps with the lost sector symbol on them.

My buddy and I have a cactus plant in our minecraft world and we named it Rick kactus

Best landing zone in the game

I think they should allow us to load up more than one Rune set to get multiple drops.  Say up to 4x.  The running back and forth reload chalice is such a tedious weird thing to do.  Just let me put in the same tune combo but make it up to 4x so I can get 4x the drops if I have the tunes for it....
---
Oh boy this things gonna be harder then i thought
---
How did u do that??? The lowest I've gotten to is like 395
---
I see they slipped halo reach into the corner. I can‚Äôt wait for it to comeback
---
Don't post other people's accounts on reddit as it's a breach of policy. But I have over 3000 matches more than you so having a higher KD than you is better in the long run
---
Doesn't have to be a huge map. Could just be a lvl.1 map with the rough shape on it and it should show enough to distinguish the design.
---
A thrall can pull your reticle over via aim assist and make you miss the crit or entire shot.

Jokes on you, my country is a continent

I'm gonna give you a tip do extensive research because while i do not know for certain what i found is you it does match up with what you said however the entire basis of your argument was my name which was based on something from a diffirent community
---
This is what I ended up doing! Had a spare GameStop gift card laying around with $7 on it so it didn‚Äôt cost me much!
---
My birthday was two months ago
---
It gets more embarrassing when you know I‚Äôm going for English.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs my bad. Ended up with a good enough solution though!
---
That's so wholesome ‚ù§, I usually try my best and help out newer players, they mainly ask for my help with whisper or with forges mainly and their reactions when they finally get that quest done is priceless üòä

Sleeper sucks tho, its nerfed, lmao jk good cosplay tho! Ima try doing my titan or batman beyond lmao
---
Yeah, all licenses you have already though will be transferred if you're on battle.net right now.
---
So if you own everything right now, you'll keep it, and be able to buy Shadowkeep when it drops. Or before. Or even right now, if you want to do that.
---
You've only played 2742 matches tho also still not my account jus because somebody likes the same game and monster from that game doesn't mean it's me look at me i'm a warlock that guys warlock is low level
---
When you try to shoot them they‚Äôre like

Sike bitch you thought

also it's a breach of policy to post somebodies kd on reddit but you did it so did i

Do it. Bet you won't.

I think taken captains are the worst with the teleporting, it‚Äôs like you shoot them once and they teleport 28 times randomly, it‚Äôs nearly impossible to land a hit on them without an AOE attack

Sure. On PRECISION frames. They should be able to map people at long distances. But they don't. High impacts do. Buff precision and rapid. Make high impacts shoot in a similar fashion to tractor cannon
---
This is why I fear posting on I'd say 40% of the communities I follow.
---
Literally me with the D1 Orbit music
---
The easiest way would be through RNG in getting a full Eververse Set dropped. Each of them drop at 10 PL and together with a Mask that has no PL, it could drop that low
---
I mean like PvP gear in general. Is there a guide on what‚Äôs good out their for PvP and PvP? 
---
I don‚Äôt want to accidentally delete and item that could be useful on my grind to 750
---
Tons of guides out there. Just gotta hit the ol' google machine up. Might want to start with "power surge bounties".
---
yep. been a bug for a while now.
---
We leaking boys
---
what handcannon is that?
---
Oh yeah
---
Have mercy on us please. Stop with these posts. There are plenty of guides. Look in the d2 main subreddit and in this subreddit, in the about section.
---
I'm actually waiting for an answer since you just went and assumed my namee was the same on destiny
---
I'm going to have fun shooting that
---
Beyond playing the playlist activity you find easiest there isn't a farm for exact runes it's all chance
---
I didnt realize how much ive been craving playing destiny until i found myself punching the foot of a leviathan in apex legends for 5 minutes. Play a titan once and its forever imbeded in ya

Huh? Titan smash bottom tree is one of the longest lasting supers when you chain your melees. That is the most frustrating thing in my to deal with.

That would really subvert my expectations..

I'm still holding out hope that Halo was actually the same universe as destiny but it was during the golden age where there's no records of what happened or how people lived, it would be so glorious.

No. They said it wasn‚Äôt on purpose.

Lord of wolves being the best weapon in PVP is like Bran becoming king.

Oh hell yeah, forgot about him. First time the youtube algorithm decided I needed to watch a video of his I was blown away, awesome content
---
Because e m p h a s i s is k e y
---
Part 1 - Reminder that the Drifter literally lies to you over and over about Aunor. Reminder that Aunor IS in line with Ikora‚Äôs interests as one of her Hidden which is reaffirmed later in her letters. Reminder that Shin‚Äôs ‚Äúalliance‚Äù with the Drifter is one of utility, at very best. Fr, read the rest of Shin‚Äôs lore since then. Reminder that the Drifter can CREATE TAKEN that he cannot actually control. Reminder that the Drifter‚Äôs entire plan is running away and hiding when the darkness comes.
---
And any claim that Aunor is a ‚Äúreligious zealot‚Äù and ‚Äújudge jury and executioner‚Äù is insanely shortsighted and based off of literally 2 lore entries. Ever read the rest?
---
*Part 2* - The Vanguard, while tolerating Drifter, is not complicit in the entirety of Shin‚Äôs plan. They tolerate Gambit because they see it as a necessary evil to adapt to future conflicts against the Darkness. They are not involved, however, in the active baiting of guardians to the Darkness and recruiting them to the Shadows Of Yor before disintegrating them. 
---
See here‚Äôs the thing: we literally lost thousands in the Red War, we don‚Äôt particularly have guardians to spare. Aunor sees the potential threats in these guardians who begin to ‚Äúwalk down sorrow‚Äôs road‚Äù but also sees that we need absolutely every hand we can get. She wants to re-educate shadows rather than eradicate. It‚Äôs that entire matter of actively baiting Guardians to the Darkness, a liability that humanity cannot afford.
---
She tolerates him by the end of the Allegiance quest primarily because Aunor has ties to Orin and recognizes that Drifter‚Äôs ties to the Nine and the Emissary are the best lead we have to get her back somehow.
---
And reminder that Drifter tells you she ‚Äútook out a city block‚Äù and implies that civilians were killed (if I remember correctly) when she went in to save a hostage taken by Shadows. And he claims he was going to talk them down. Except: The entire city block had been evacuated beforehand, it wasn‚Äôt a city block that was destroyed it was an abandoned warehouse occupied by a few shadows, the hostage taken was Aunor‚Äôs own ghost, and the Drifter himself was the one who GAVE her the location of the warehouse and basically said ‚Äúgo nuts‚Äù. Finally, the Investigation is still being endorsed by Ikora (literally half the vanguard lol) so saying you‚Äôre not siding with the vanguard is questionable at best.
---
*Part 3* - Drifter is continuously tempting guardians to the dark. And while Shin isn‚Äôt killing every guardian who comes close, he‚Äôs still killing many. Like in the Salt Mines lore entry, those are still guardians that could possibly be re-educated rather than killed. Not to mention the additional deaths within Gambit itself that the Drifter does nothing to prevent. Perhaps he needs to be kept around. But siding with him and endorsing continued guardian deaths is fundamentally wrong.
---
This is all from debating someone else on this topic, so there may be some missing context but you should be able to get the gist of it.

That was nice man

I‚Äôll give khakis points for being the last bastion of a true console hardcore player (I mean, just look what happened with CoS) and for usually being the first to get raid guides out. That said, his voice has always felt like nails on chalkboard, and his worst side of content-stretching comes out when all the relevant things have already been covered. Houndish gets points for one thing: consistently being the first guy to upload news content, even if it is mediocre and often full of future speculations.
---
Only reason he makes the list is that he‚Äôs always the first guy for me to learn destiny news, which I usually just to listen to (for the pro, a nice 1.5x watch speed helps a lot). I want my news ASAP, and he‚Äôs the guy for that. Personally I can wait for Datto or Ehroar for guide content, or I prefer to figure things out myself
---
I‚Äôm talking about the Forsaken supers
---
Ooohhh boy. If last years "Super Kills" moment of triumph is anything to go by, that "Crucible Pinnacle Arms" one is gonna trigger a lot of people
---
Titan melee abilities are like hunter supers
---
Hahahaha all solid points honestly, I don‚Äôt watch him often anymore (might‚Äôve unsubbed at some point) but i‚Äôll take him over khakis just on voice alone
---
Ok but serioisly. MORE ART pls bungie. My screens need it.
---
I kinda wish they would‚Äôve brought back the exotic version. It wasn‚Äôt the best gun, but it was versatile and fun imo.
---
Actually I don't even bother anymore, that some weapons are only accessible, if you do PVP.. but in my opinion there should be an alternative, and even if I have to grind through shattered throne again and again, I like it far more to play PVE than PVP. I ended up not getting these weapons, because I just don't like playing PVP.

Decided to do some research to back up my intuition. Bright blue/green tinted water can occur naturally from either glacial flows or lava systems, each doing drastically different things to the water, and the second being potentially dangerous to the human body.
---
Given as the rock formations around this river were generated from nearby lava, I stand by what I said, that the water could be dangerous. It ‚Äúcould‚Äù be dangerous, not ‚Äúis‚Äù dangerous.
---
Wish people would think before they downvote.

You're the worst kind of person. Get over it

r/hitboxporn

What do you plan on using it for for pve yeah something like rampage outlaw is good but for pvp its not aweful but could be better.
---
It‚Äôs to give you enough time to get into the chalice and make sure you get the combo you want to get out of the chest. Then more time to run through the Menagerie and search for the lore items

It‚Äôs a game. Play it for fun. Doesn‚Äôt always have to be for rewards. Some of the most fun I‚Äôve had in D2 was 30 or so runs in on Leviathan with absolutely no reward to speak of.
---
Have a multilayer on your nightfall card that is x2 and you should be good. I recommend lowering your power cap by 175 and then putting on whatever singe you like. And that should be enough.

The whole game. I take so much shots every time... Great design from Bungie.

Titans are basically just a crutch in pvp. They get a one hit melee, supers that either have such a big blast radius that there is no way you can miss a kill, or they make you so tanky you are guaranteed at least one kill, they have arguably some of the best pvp exotics in the game (OEM), and are able to place down barricades to protect themselves and teammates when capturing objectives. 
---
The only downside to titans is they have low mobility and SUCK in pve for most situations. 
---
Take a hunter for an example, almost all of their abilities require skill to use. Knifes? Skill (and even then they deal little to no damage) Dodging? Skill. Golden gun? At least you actually have to aim with it. Blade barrage? Not a good example. Truesight? Requires precision. 
---
Am I saying if you use a titan you must be unskilled and in need of a crutch? No. Just pointing out that their loadout appeals to more easy to use than other classes which makes them very annoying to deal with (especially new guardians. Its like the only ability they know how to use is shoulder charge)
---
I‚Äôm max light already. I just need something to do for the 2 months between now and Shadowkeep

I'm a solo player since D1. After thousands of hours played I've done everything and anything in both D1 and 2. I've never understood people that say they can't do something because you need a group. It's so easy to find good players to do things.  From flawless in trials to flawless raids. This community is amazing and the bungie companion app + the console lfg makes it simple

But then everyone hates you because you interrupted their farming, just leave if you don‚Äôt want to farm.
