I got it third

---
The Drifters offering a chance at salvation... Take it!
---
Oh, alright. Thank you so much :)
---
Your can do main story missions patrols ect just no fireteam/raids/strikes/crucible/vanguard/gambit
---
Also appears to be 1v1.
---
all we needed was a sunsinger to self res
---
I thought shin made the shadows of yor as the spy dredgen yor to lure weak guardians who would turn to the dark out of the vanguard. 
---

---
I thought drifter was the one who wants us to learn the dark side because the light isnt enough to fight back.
---
holy shit
---
He probably gets shit on to immediately think you were shitting on him. Which is sad tbh.
---
O’ bearer mine?
---
Y'all ever seen a modified, extended barrel nail gun before?
---
Bungo: Ohohohoho... We made that!!
---
Same, but we were doing not bad, so we just kept going to farm chests.
---
I mean, we beat them in OT, but it was close. Dude had like 12 invader kills. Now I don’t feel bad making him lose his streak.
---
Coming to you live from NBC News.
---
I like turtles
---
Yes and no yes to what you said about shin but also he wants us to walk between light and dark. Which again is why he gave use both thorn and the last word and also malfeasance but drifter doesnt know that. Now he lets people use malfeasance so they can get a taste of the power of the dark but also be afraid of it in turn. Those who taste it and want more aren on shins and the shadows hit list. Callum voluntarily became a martyr to cement that in guardians minds before using it so they can know the consequences. Now drifter also wants to use the dark but only to help himself achieve his own goal of peace or safety. He is like a broken hero who lost hope kinda.
---
How did he do this?
---
I love lamp.
---
Well you'll get wormhusk nerfed again.
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 13.
---
/r/Fireteams please.
---
Get juh-baited lol
---
Yep. I bought the whole thing when it came out on PS4. But what I did for the pc, before I got done building my gaming PC they had the base game for free.. so I logged on just to download it and aquire it. When I finished my PC I only had to buy the dlc and annual pass. I think I saved like 20 or 30 bucks if I remember right
---
I’m confused
---
Jesus,  you think I’m gonna read all that?
---
Yeah but like i said he probably gets alot of shitty messages so much that getting a good one is unheard of for him. It happens alot not only in gaming but in life in general alot of people get put down so much compliments seems like fantasy.
---
Haha!
---
Without ransoms and not trying too hard 10 is achievable to still have enough time for all the bosses. 15 is easy and 20 should give you a little extra time. With random match making... It's super hard to get people to die at 15 or 20... They just wanna keep going for no reason cause they don't know
---
Like I said, you disregarded 90% of the Taken King story. So i did too.
---
I played countdown once using liar’s handshake and bottom tree arcstrider, and I cross countered three guardians trying to defuse while they were disorient by disorienting blow. 
---
Sure top tree is the best for flat out damage, middle tree’s arc wave is good for priming targets, but I think bottom tree needs some attention when using liar’s handshake. 
---
Normally when people melee you, it’s because you’re on low health or they’re trying to shoulder charge you, resulting in instant death. So normally you have to melee first, you exchange punches, you land the second punch, they die as they would without cross counter active, you get a little bit of health back, but not enough to let you survive another melee hit. This is implying that you haven’t been obliterated by dust rock blues or team shot by Luna’s or NF yet.
---
If you use disorienting blow, it disorients the enemy and their teammates next to them, which gives you an opening to attack. You can then use gambler’s dodge to close the gap (dodge has damage resistance), then melee them with cross counter which also activates your newly refreshed disorienting blow (gambler’s dodge refreshes cooldown), so on so forth.
---
You can also do a super satisfying takedown where you jump over the enemy, stick them with a flux grenade midair, hit them with a melee when you land, and while you move onto your next kill you get to listen to the sweet sound of your previous target exploding behind you. The melee also activates cross counter, which makes this great for entering a fight.
---
You get a bunch of cooldown reduction perks on way of the wind, plus increased sprint speed for moving into melee range. Not entirely sure about this, but I think disoriented enemies can’t sprint, so most people backpedal and jump a lot. This can be a problem since you don’t have the deadly reach perk found on top tree arcstrider, but remember; Destiny 2 is a looter shooter. You have guns. Shoot em dead.
---
This is mainly just rambling, but I just wanted to point out that way of the wind is a decent pick for Liar’s Handshake too. So if you want to feel like a budget assassin’s creed character, give it a whirl.
---
420!! Nice! I'll just take my 11 and leave then...
---
fezighart: "Sweat Match"  
---
also fezighart: *adsing with last word*
---
lol
---
I send GG from time to time, got back an "I know" once. Some take gaming very seriously, for some reason.
---
So you have zero friends then because you should never talk to random people.
---
What the fuck happened to destiny while I was away
---
Because it appears to be a private match
---
careful with that
---
Lol I’ve got a total Mad-on for it
---
I would say average is probably more like 1.4 KDA. That's where I sit and I would definitely consider myself average
---
I miss D1 trials
---
Oh...oh no
---
It’s nothing compared to shotguns, Luna’s, NF, and spectral blades.
---
I dont know what Bungie thinks. I did t get any for the ascendent challange but I got one every time I ran Apheolons Rest, or whatever it's called. I grinded for like 20 minutes to get all pages, super easy.
---
I have 1...
---
Yeah i did the strand as well and got the 5 i needed really easily
---
Doing wrong you needed a hunter and you all should’ve been using the ace of spades
---
Give him Kepri's Horn or Crest of Alfa Lupi.
---
Bro what... I’m currently watching that part.
---
I have gauntlets with shotgun scavenger/fastball or shotgun scavenger/shotgun loader, don’t know which one is more effective
---
Hi everyone. I started a podcast at the start of this year and am creating a community for it. I wanted to get feedback on how to make it better and how to help bring our community together with it. I had an idea for a LFG section, Hangout rooms, Memes, Reddit Feed, Podcasts Feed, YouTuber Feed, Bungie Feed, music bot, clan features, and community based discussions with our featured guests each week. We alraedy had guests like Creator of Octodad, PS Nation, and Green from FFC. If you're interested in checking out our community on discord I would love to share an invite. I would love to get your feedback on how to build something for this community that will bring guardians together.
---
I called a piece of crap for dancing at the farm with having Commander’s Blessings giving everyone a speed boost. I legitimately didn’t understand
---
Happy Cake Day!

&gt;low resiliences
---
&gt;198 damage 
---
OK sure you might not meme 10 resilience overshield OEMs with it but it's still pretty consistent overall
---
Chill out satan...
---
I will pay anything under about 40 or 30 dollars for the sword or the hammer if they're really that cheap
---
Speaking of showcasing set, what armor did you use and what shader? Looks cool btw.
---
Thanks man. Look forward to seeing you in Gambit\Prime
---
Wait nevermind I saw the other comment
---
what is trials?
---
Damn. Well hopefully they bring it back😂
---
Yeah, I don't mind spend money on garenteed cosmetics, I even bought the Thorn one because it matched the whisper one lol 😂
---
A fix that Bungie has said will not come.
---
What I was thinking, that and orb confetti. Going to be rough for the first few days lol
---
Yeah as long as I know what Im getting I dont mind paying.
---
Stop reading.  Just watch.
---
Well unless their accounts stay at legend and/or higher rank to be a burden to your team, I see no problem here. As long as they reset the rank after maxibg out to get NF they're gonna be back to 0 glory. With the case of Luna/Recluse, honestly Fabled isn't that hard to reach IMO
---
Amen
---
Agreed, I'm not good with Handcannons because of my aim and I'm nearly done with the last step and at 2300 glory
---
Me and my cousin were playing crusible a few hours ago and my and my 10 resilience Titan got 1 shotted, why
---
So, admittedly, I did see a shot that looked like you aimed behind somebody as they were moving away and you dropped them. BUT. I was watching via phone with no volume so I assumed you got an assist or I saw it wrong.  If that was a kill, that was HEAVY aim assist and I’d agree somebody should look at it. Until then, enjoy your tracking rail gun. ;-)
---
Excuse me cause was never on mar when he passed away .
---
My guy you straight stole this
---
Which is why solo que is absolutely necessary... But Bungie doesn't care...
---
Got Shards of Galanor in a random world drop then Two Tailed Fox from Xur’s engram!
---
Also got my Crimson catalyst
---
r/Phalanxed
---
As a fellow invader I’m impressed, I’m usually the guy up close and personal with my last man standing! Almost at my 200th army of one medals (180ish) invading is honestly so much fun.
---
A missed opportunity!!! Why didn’t I think of this...
---
Do I need to get the Prometheus Lens back out?
---
Yeah he had a green xp bar.
---
To be more specific it's mars where the public even starts that you can see looking down through Anna brays window.
---
Only the sheeps complain. The ones who never try out new things and always stick to the meta guns and abilities. 
---
I hate those guys...I really do!
---
This though, I love this! Try out other stuff and builds is what this game should be all about. It feels like everyone forgot this nowadays...
---
5 hours later and hes still grinding
---
Yeah I thought about buying it but it just looks so bland and boring
---
maybe with the season of opulence, and as a hunter who got the shards yesterday I hope for titans that they get one of those aswell
---
We do have one. Ursa Furiosa, makes your void shield return energy.
---
F
---
Error 404: Motes not found.
---
dont even get me started on the cloth physics in destiny
---
sometimes it breaks and makes for hilarious moments
---
for the most part it just looks goofy.
---
classic simple green cloaks with fur around the neck and the iron banner isignia with the hands and the hammer
---
or you get somethin kinda classy, like the mantle of gheleon.
---
I'm sure his comment will hold him together as he does so.
---
Striker . Not sentinel.
---
Should have a bird's eye view
---
#Angery bug noises
---
Da hat aber jemand ne Menge quickplay gespielt nicht wahr?
---
I don't have ace of spades yet but I use SunShot cause I like the way it looks
---
Oh. I misunderstood. Lol.
---
I wondered about the class ability and then I stopped wondering without tying anything but especially if your shotgun apeing this is likely more useful, nice one
---
They're not bringing back trials OF THE NINE because those trials were disliked yes, but everybody asked for trials of osiris to back. And factions? Who disliked factions? I mean sure people didn't like the whole faction rally bs because we'd rather have then as permanent vendors but nobody disliked factions.
---
Nice man. I just got my invaders set today and ended up doing the same thing, except with Thunderlord.
---
In pvp*
---
Probably at least 2 leavers and those are the backfills. Those are probably just the unlucky dudes who got thrown into that crap storm.
---
*laughs in riskrunner*
---
Nice man. Literally wiped out a teams notes earlier today it’s so satisfying now that I’m not longer ont he malfeasance quest line.
---
tfw xur gave me last weeks invitation, im not buying anything from him ever again.
---
I hate it when randoms take an invade and dont get anything done. I prefer to run in a 4 stack and I be the designated invader or I take turns with a friend who also knows what hes doing.
---
Neither. Outlaw + Kill Clip Duke MK. 44
---
ohhh, thank you for the answere
---
PvE damage*
---
~~just wait until I get my daughter hawkmoon back. I will reign terror in the crucible once again~~
---
Running comp to finish a quest and running it to get pinnacle weapons are two different matters. One focuses on getting the requirements to finish the quest, aka kills, headshots, defeats, while the other needs you to climb. You can do fine in a match, doesn't mean you'll climb. And solo queuing doesn't matter when all you need to is to complete objectives.
---
Meh, that's your response? You couldn't put time in to show that I was wrong? Just meh. Falling back to Destiny 1. This isn't Destiny 1, this is Destiny 2. TTKs are different and things are balanced differently. It wouldn't be so bad if weapons were to the same level, or there were counterplay, but there essentially isn't. Bringing up Destiny 1 has no relevance to this topic. 
---
When you say play smart, what do you mean? Do you push, cause that means you're taking extra damage before the gunfight even starts. Best you might do is a trade, if you don't die. Try to snipe? The skip grenades go around walls since they can track. Can you elaborate or is that the best you can do, tell others to play smart and all is good.
---
The damage bonus works against overshields?  I don't think it changes how arbalest functions in PVP.  As for supers... Again, a sniper is still a better choice, not sure why this gun would be good against a super
---
What have you done!?! Now they know!!
---
I've been playing for a few months now and as much as I love PVE content, I honestly can't understand how am I supposed to have fun in Gambit, when I'm getting insta-killed every time someone is invading.. How do you guys enjoy this mode ? Is there a special way to play Gambit ?
---
Already posted
---
The loot?
---
Neither. Run Last Word and go full close-quarters.
---
The event going on gives you a tonic that can drastically lower the cooldown on either your grenade, melee, or class ability.
---
He's using the tonic (and armor that boosts the effect) to make his Dodge cooldown almost immediate, the Nightstalker tree that lets you go invisible after you Dodge, and the Wormhusk Crown that gives you health when you Dodge.
---
The idea is to spam at weak enemies like thralls to empty the mag, reload for kill clip and then attack a major with rampage X3 with kill clip. 
---
For PvP killing someone then reloading allows a 2 tap faster than a duke. It does have some ammo concerns though. 
---
It is supposed to free up outlaw by using drop mag and while you burn through ammo fast you kill fast too. It's most people's idea of a god roll.
---
Correct😂😂
---
We live in a city
---
Send my regards to that friend of your. And my lucky bullets too.
---
I apologized in advance to everyone in comp because im a hunter right now
---
Your response feels hostile, but I'll bite.
---
  
---
The story is typically told via PvE so I'm considering it the 'base game'. Still, as a more casual player who only comes to raids when somebody needs help, I would actually appreciate it if the PvE equivalent was cosmetics too. Badass cosmetics, of course. Things that really show your might.
---
Outbreak of the Worm
---
If they had it, they’d be a literal walking tank. Your idea is cool but I think it should be an entire subclass tree rather than a single node.
---
what a bro answer
---
That is true but if u outplay them without your super u should be rewarded
---
That name sound like a straight ripoff of the Destiny Community Podcast
---
why no full invader set tho
---
What's your armour and weapons loadout? So far I see trust dust rock blues but what's your heavy because it must be exotic.
---
You are. If you outplay them without your super, you prevent the enemy from a bunch of kills, you prevent them from orbs, and you have an extra super that can be used for kills. I think supers having a damage reduction is fine. I just think snipers should have a large buff to their PvP headshot multiplier
---
True. This one game I had this guy was camping the portal and wouldnt bank to open the portal if I was near it. We ended up sharing (aka i stole some invades) and we each managed to get some solid 3-4 man invades in. Probably one of the better experiences with randoms I've had.
---
Wel
---
I can dig that
---
Ya thats kinda what i thought. Go get it first the youll see why you’re wrong about it.
---
A sniper isn’t a scout rifle in the same way
---
Oh dude I’m right there the hunter in the middle
---
Very cool. There’s only three cards tho
---
What platform are you on?
---
Loot?
---
Ok, it's comparable to it's counter part.  Is it comparable to every other power weapon in terms of usability?
---
It’s not hostile, it’s common sense and doesn’t require an interview from Bungie. It sounds like you’ve been playing too much Fortnite and apex.
---
Wrong it what way? Will I become so enamored of it that I will shout to the heavens to buff it instead? I’m pretty average to below average in PvP, btw. Or will I learn the thing isn’t that great after all, and the folks killing me with it like they are just flicking a cigarette butt are actually super skilled and I should just leave well enough alone? As a non owner, I still feel like the thing is broken.
---
If you're lucky you can get helmets dropped 😉
---
Yeah, luck
---
The revelry has made me realize that cooldown across all abilities should be smaller (not counting super).
---
Like it finally seems to make a difference to be a hunter or a warlock or a titan.
---
Not to this level, obviously, but across the board all abilities should be available a bit more often.
---
Even if you havent got the notorious bounty completed??
---
It would just end up as guns with dicks, it always does
---
Use wormhusk and class boost instead, with a trapper hunter. Grenades didn't touch me. Lol
---
I know that part. I’m definitely doing heroic. I just didn’t know there was a specific icon that tells you the specific singe that week.
---
High Five!
---
I would really like a patrol area in the city.
---
Yeah I can too w/all chars tbh
---
Well 2nd step would be to grind to lvl 50. 
---
Then Unlock Ada-1's Forges. 
---
Step 3. Profit.
---
Fellow person who has reset their valor! I got one catalyst for Vigilance Wing in all that time. 
---
If you are in a clan, once the clan is above a certain level (I think 4, but it will tell you on the clan banner in your character menu), you have an increased chance of getting catalysts if you are playing with a clanmate. I actually have not gotten a crucible catalyst since this feature was added, but i'd say it's worth trying if you can find a clan.
---
Ah I see
---
Altho I must admit I wish every gun had a version with fixed perks so I didn't need to grind or infuse every time my light level jumped 50 points above the power level of the gun
---
Oh, sorry! Like I said, it's in the lower left corner. Give me a few minutes and I can log on and get a screenshot.
---
I’m in a level 6 clan, always playing with clan mates. I didn’t know if they had specific requirements like for instance MIDA
---
Not *that* custom. Like just the colors. Like pie each shader is the 4 triangles, just pick the colors of each one and then each triangle has a preset location like primary, secondary, trim, accent. Like that and you get a full color wheel and a few preset patterns or effects you can color and unlock different patterns by running strikes or playing crucible. I think that would be cool.
---
Life always finds a way
---
I'll manage. She brought tequila to the tower and said we're breaking rules. I'm just embracing the spirit while she's here. :)
---
Outbreak worm
---
I’m gonna propose that to bungie actually. Maybe they’ll actually read it
---
&gt;D2 was released on Wednesday and Ghaul attacked on Wednesday so that's why the vanguard were caught off guard
---
I love this community
---
Still an irrelevant point
---
Haha I did the same thing!
---
Fuck yeah brother
---
There are curated rolls, which are masterworked items that are considered to be the best combination of perks for that gun. But other than that, and certain vendor weapons, it's all RNG. But don't quote me on that.
---
1. You don't need to be in orbit to do anything, you just need to be on the planet the mission is on.
---
2. All you want to do is the missions with the red war icon, (it's red with a little arch symbol on it)
---
3. Sometimes you need to level up before you can continue the story
---
I was using Arbalest and the Recluse in QP with bottom tree golden gun. I was getting 5-6 supers per game and constantly hitting my Arbalest shots. This guy came bottom of his team and sent me this when the game ended
---
Will side quests have the red Icon as well?
---
No I have thorn already. Just  having fun with no meta weapons
---
No arguments about what they did to Vance’s character. Or Osiris’. Curse was a bad DLC.
---
Xol let us kill him so we would use Whisper of the Worm and kill powerful enemies with it, giving him more power. It’s unsure if we really even killed Xol.
---
Something tells me you haven’t looked into the story of the Cabal at all. They were the least interesting previously because they were never fleshed out, that changed with D2. We got the story of Calus’s reign, Ghaul’s coup, and how the Cabal became a race of warriors hellbent on conquering the stars.
---
Ghaul is actually a very interesting villain, but you refuse to acknowledge it because you want to hate the game. He’s not someone who just showed up and stole the light. Up until the end, Ghaul wanted to be chosen and become a true lightbearer. Taking it would be admitting defeat, something he had never known. His own hubris is what got him killed.
---
Zavala wasn’t a chicken during the Red War, he was the gung ho one who wanted to attack the Almighty. In Forsaken he becomes a “coward” because he believes the going to war with the Reef only a year after the Red War would leave the City too open. What I don’t think you get is that the Vanguard’s personality change isn’t just bad character development, it has a reason. The Vanguard is cracking because of the Red War and Forsaken, and Zavala and Ikora are questioning their ability to lead. The Vanguard may end up collapsing entirely.
---
The supers are absolutely not the exact same as Destiny 1. I’ve fired Golden Gun 15 times in a single activation. Someone posted a video yesterday of 9 PvP kills with a Fist of Havoc. Nova Bomb, Golden Gun, Blade Barrage, and Chaos Reach are able to absolutely eviscerate bosses, and Well does the job that Bubble used to, but better. Most of our abilities are FAR more powerful than they were in Destiny 1, and as you would say, these are facts. But people like you can’t get over Bubble, which is reborn with Well, and Sunsinger, which admittedly would be cool to have back. But as I’ve said, there’s so many cool new abilities that I’d happily trade in Sunsinger for.
---
This is my last reply to you. I’m tired of arguing with someone who is so blind to their own bias they refuse to acknowledge anything that might go against the point they’re making. Take off your rose tinted glasses and stop with the personal attacks, maybe then someone will take you seriously. I’ve humored you for longer than I should have.
---
People just get salty over nothing because they didn't grow up to respect with others. People like that ruin the community, so best thing to do is don't waste your time on them and have the best of fun you can limit
---
No, there aren't any sidequests in this game. The only side mission-like things are orange icons with a sword in the middle, which you don't have to do with the exception of one on earth when you first go to earth
---
TLW was a big let down for me, It's actually in my vault. I find the Sunshot quite useful due firefly. If there's adds it takes them out quicker than going at them one at a time with Thorn or Ace.
---
Agreed. I’m trying to be as non-toxic as I can but sometimes, people just stay keen on staying toxic and rude.
---
The Devs generally think what the community thinks. Thats why the game has been steadily improving.
---
Pot meets cattle because your arguments are neither good, nor will they become better with your "attidute".
---
If a weapon fails to perform good, it isn't that great. Normal fusion rifles and shotguns are stronger in CqC, and sniper rifles are stronger in Long Range.
---
In mid-Range, you can just jump up or move a few steps to the side when you hear the unique sound of it. 
---
There is nothing more to say and as long as you don't come up with actual arguments that do anything outside of marking you as a little kid who throws a tantrum over people that have a clearly diffrent opinion with good reasons, you won't make many fans in here.
---
They should just make a ghost shell that shoots all crits all the time. Even when it’s not out. Even when you aren’t playing.

Why Lock anything good behind content at all? I cant complete the raid, but I still want to get 1K Voices. Why cant I get it from doing other stuff?
---
you HAVE been marked by the Buick Gods, time to repent and buy a new buick
---
Was this done in illustrator?
---
Words of wisdom right there.
---
If you mean at a low character light level than no. IIRC some weapons need you to be at lvl20 and some definitely need you to be lvl50.
---
What?
---
I know I can play on either EU or US
---
My question is, whether I can or cannot ACTIVATE something that I bought on the US store if my account is in EU
---
While doing Thorn I found I actually liked it. Besides the shotgun Ikelos don't get enough love.
---
&gt;&gt; Pot meets cattle

Pot meets **kettle**.
---
&gt;&gt; your "attidute”
---
Don’t reply like an edgy moron and you won’t get any attitude. Also can you even type?
---
&gt;&gt; If a weapon fails to perform good
---
Perform **well**. Oh my god. I can’t even take your opinion seriously when you display such distinct lack of intellectual power.
---
&gt;&gt; you won't make many fans in here.
---
Oh, the horror!
---
How do you find out when Mara is there? I remember the Oracle or whatever the woman was told me she wasn't but I don't know if it was before or after I made the offering. 
---
And I mostly play solo so the first Titan subclass thing would for me be the arc one or solar.  People say they like both but I'm not sure... I like solar, I'm leaning that way but arc sounds fun.
---
Evil Demons, and Malevolent Spirits. Be Gone!
---
I don’t think so but it might just be a glitch for your game
---
Xur’s engram drops Forsaken items now?
---
either guiding light, treasure hunter, or instant dismantle
---
That and it's forced down our throats through MANY exotic quests and bounties. The game tries to revolve around Crucible way too heavily even though Crucible is easily the worst PVP experience i've had in a game. I feel like I could genuinely enjoy crucible, which not going to lie I do at times. But that's very rarely. Like: No one using the bullshit weapons and no one using super on me.
---
So much Bungie can do with crucible and yet they just.. Don't. Too busy trying to make Gambit and Gambit prime their priority now. And that too sucks ass most of the time.
---
I’m pretty sure he won’t as it’s technically not an exotic engram drop chance. It can only drop from the loot room in LW essentially eliminating it from the loot pool I think.
---
Great now I can't stop reading it like that
---
Yes.
---
Warlock gang stands in solidarity with punch class
---
I *am* the Crucible guardian, what do you need?
---
Damn .. but mine max is 60sth .. but no photo proof so u are the king  .. untill ..
---
Oh okay in that case I’d agree I’ve seen some really good looking rares and commons.-
---
Well completely agree with you on that front my friend. Heck give me a ghost that auto dismantles blues haha. Still, good post, good point. Feels a bit rate on this sub lately!
---
My question is what content is difficult enough PvE wise to even worry about what class you're running? Weapons outshine classes to the point of making subclasses just a safety threshold to fall back on. The big issue people complain about is reckoning, but reckoning is far more a factor of the daily modifiers than subclasses. Really the weapon powercreep in this game is so strong in PvE that I find myself checking the weapon loadout of pugs and not their classes. Look at the verdant forest, with the right weapon loadouts you can kill all 5 bosses at sub15 branches, but I've seen pugs hit like wet noodles because their weapon loadouts were ineffective regardless of their class.

tldr: Weapons matter more than class, and modifiers matter more than class in the reckoning.

Guy with sunbracers sitting idle in inventory: "That's a good idea."

Yeah, but that only makes sense if you want to counter... Like why would you run a counter to (maybe) pull a single kill when you could just run spectral and wipe a team twice over... If you miss, you get fucked by spectral blades

Me 2 except we still killed it

I've done it twice now. Just throw near the top of the forge between rounds while the forge is not active.

I think it has something to do with the invisible cone on top of the forge that keeps you from jumping on top of it.
