WHO SHOT THE WELL AND KILLED THEMSELVES!!!!

You basically get full rift when you're bloodied.

\*sniff\*

\*sniff\*
---
Smells like nerf inbound
---
or you have the primevil and the enemy team dosnt stop invading. I mean that is how you play the game but for fucks sake bungie put a cooldown on that. 
---
I mean they want to get the match done with would be far more toxic if they let the match continue till the timer ran out.
---
I feel so bad about killing its heart. Is it too cute...
---
I didn't know exotics have different perks, I've always thought their stats are the same every time. Good to know! Is this only with vendor exotics or also with world drops?
---
same
---
I farmed mine through EDZ lost sectors - it doesn't need to be on Io.
---
I was Dredgen before I pledged. Title means nothing to me! I went vanguard in a heartbeat and would do it all over again 
---
they let us win when they were 2-0
---
Should give you ammo as well when you land a hit
---
Frankly I‚Äôd be disappointed if it wasn‚Äôt like that.
---
No pls
---
There's currently (less than a few days) a well know exploit to do with the new armour sets. Melts bosses in a few seconds. 
---
How is it bugged?
---
Meh. Try it at a higher glory level
---
Indeed
---
Same quest from FoTL but (hopefully) not time-gated ie you can just run through the steps one after the next.
---
I'm not super bad at pvp but it's been rough trying to solo queue cuz my friends won't touch comp, it's all round feelsbadman
---
Very true, but rarely do I stop and take the time to look between massacring aliens.
---
Sorry to disappoint you, but this was found the day it was released. Hasn't had any purpose so far.
---
He is the one
---
I‚Äôve been dabbling in comp recently and enjoying it, even as a solo q‚Äôer. If you were on Ps4, I‚Äôd have happily helped you out, brother 
---
Gotta practice man
---
Sans?
---
Thats shaxx when he first got res‚Äôd
---
I appreciate it, it's the thought that counts! One of these days I'll get my comp quests done!
---
Fingers crossed and prayer to the Nine! Maybe one day if I get a monster PC, and if my damn stats can cross over :‚Äô)
---
I THOUGHT IT WAS THANONAUT BOOTS üò´üò´üò´
---
It is tho.
---
Nice. What sniper is that? I keep seeing it everywhere. 
---
What subclass you run? You can get good dps on any class if you use the right subclass. Idk about Titan though that's a tough one, you might have to attempt a melting point. 
---
enemy team was good, invader on my team was just better. wiped them 3 times with a sniper. at this point they pretty much gave up on the match
---
That's a clean Photoshop man 
---
You didn't notice the Ghally in his heavy slot ?
---
I respect that
---
ma'adim subterrane 4 lyyyyyffffeeee
---
if they are doing quests like lunas howl, mountaintop or thorn they get progress for killing you. 2v4's suck but what else would they do?
---
It‚Äôs hiiiiiiiiiiiiigh noon 
---
Gosh darn it!
---
Was being sarcastic lol. Worked in fooling you üòóüòâ
---
I don't buy it
---
Lol almost every time I play it, I get a team where the players just leave the match and if they don't leave they're off somewhere other than where the enemy is, goofing off. If they actually make kills and collect motes they hold on to them while The Drifter shouts at them to summon the prime evil for a good 2 minutes... I am not that great at the game, but I at least bank, invade (usually getting kills) and stay on task. I play on PS4.
---
was about to mention this, its probably the deadliest adclearing build for gambit
---
Sad day man
---
Duh
---
Yeah. Hell, it was the first thing I unlocked during my titan's campaign. And whenever I used it, I just go Whirlwind Willy on anyone that's in my way like a black friday shopper.
---
I love how your we able to nail twenty golden gun shots but manage to slightly miss a few malfeasance shots right in front of you lol 
---
Taken spawn orbs do damage, not sure if this is intentional but they consistently eat/destroy tethers. 
---
McCree would feel proud.

Almost done with Luna‚Äôs so I will

In game footage?

Holy geez, 8000? The highest I'll go is 1600
---
What‚Äôs a Petra run?
---
Me when I see a group of dregs 
---
This, this is what its all about!! Love!!
---
A flawless run of the Last Wish raid. I believe it is wish 13 to start the run. 
---
No we
---
Golden Gun not lasting long enough? It's a one shot hand cannon cross map. With a potential 6 kills. You want it to give what 8, 10, 12 shots?
---
I have numerous times gunned down Luna's Howl users with an Auto Rifle in a 1v1 confrontation and my KD is abysmal. They suffer from flinch too, aim for the head ;)
---
Very nice! I completed for the first time (normal run) last night with players from my clan so I‚Äôm far off a Petra‚Äôs run version
---
Ok so nothing for a new guy, got it :D
---
Haha, yeah, we did around 30 normal versions of this raid before we tried the flawless 
---
Needs higher PvE potential. I think most exotics try to strike a certain balance between the two, though they might be focused more toward one than the other. This one just seems purely PvP, though.
---
I do like the idea of a cross-class exotic, though, but it does seem hard to make it synergize with all three classes equally.
---
How do you get Redrix? 
---
Anybody else read this in a Scottish accent?
---
I prefer the Jonathan, Toaster is nice too. Resembles one and toasts your ads/guardians.
---
I dont
---
LOL I have ROWS of it.
---
Yes and those who say no are simply lying and hoping it doesnt get nerfed lmao
---
&gt;hey guys, first time posting here. i  finished the destiny forsaken campaign 2 days ago and i managed the unlock a new subclass for my hunter (blade barrage), and now i want to unlock spectral blades but i dont know how to get another seed of light to do so. i know i need the dreaming city but i dont really know if i need anything specific or should be a specific light level (im 540 now). also is it difficult to get another seed of light? or is it an easy mission. asking for a friend ;)
---
Oh, can you get another seed of light from the queen?
---
I have a rare bounty and the box and I'd like to thank you for letting me know to save the bounty.
---
On the horizon 
---
Next week...One Eyed Mask. The week after that...Shards of Galanor. And they've already announced they're handing out Thunderlord soon. Yeah, real good call...
---
Blood cleaver Lost sector is packed with cabal. That‚Äôs how I got mine and did the bounty. 
---
The title made my night
---
*Scotch
---
But.. it does happen.. can we just focus on that for a sec?
---
I am so fucking happy Banshee will get some real use again, right now the guy pales in comparison to Ada which is really sad for the Tower's dedicated gunsmith!
---
I'm a big fan of the Foregone Conclusion, which is a Warmind weapon if I recall correctly. It's one of those auto rifles with a high firerate and little spread so it's hella nice in the Crucible!
---
Locked perks tho, but at least that makes it easy to level the damn thing
---
Psn: Daleart 
---
Throw me an invite sure. 
---
Very nice bro
---
Ugh same.. 
---
Yes &amp; Yes
---
Random rng and I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôve ignited forges 32 times (I counted the totals on the emblems)
---
Done
---
As a Gunslinger main, I now need to change my pants 
---
Crouch is the q button for me. I play without a thumb on my left hand.
---
I believe most, including myself use toggle sprint and hold crouch, this frees the pinky to hit slide when needed and stops the character getting stuck in crouch after the slide slowing you momentum
---
Not played in a while. Did they change the six-shooter subclass or something?
---
He will forever be missed
---
A
---
Lol I can imagine
---
B
---
Now if I tried that in that situation, I‚Äôd get a no and get teabagged on every death.
---
just use a Crooked Fang (rolls don't matter) and it just wipes the entire row with a headshot
---
I call it scrub gun. You have a great weekend too. 
---
# I SAID RELAX!!
---
I play on pc btw
---
ITS HIGH NOOOOOOOOOOOON
---
That's honestly the worst  feeling, it's why I'm afraid of taking breaks in the middle of gaming sessions when you magically find a dream team.
---
Right there with ya bud.
---
Mesa umbra, if you will.
---
I was gonna say that if you played on console you had to be disgustingly bad because this season is extremely easy on console 
---
But... That sounds like a master race problem.
---
Ahh vault of glass... single handily the most insane raid if you were in current season it released. That first boss...out of this world. I need a raiding team now. I
---
Just returned recently since Leviathan and raiding doesn‚Äôt seem like the big deal it use to be. Anyone on PC looking for a hunter and a wizard who are raid ready?
---
Ah yeah you right fam. 
---
Type to go Cammy mode on his ass, know what I'm sayin?
---
I fuckin laughed. Jesus man, oh my stomach hurts...lmfao

If you have the annual pass go to the drifter and do the power surge bounties. They‚Äôre super easy and they give you an entire set of 640 power items. Then do anything and everything that says ‚Äúpowerful gear‚Äù.

I just wanted to see the hammer got fanned.
---
Sunshot could do that quicker.
---
Wrong subclass tree but I'll allow it for the pun
---
I counted 25 :/
---
Yeah? And are you sure you wanna fight my purple spam sticks?
---
Lol but when I end up in a 1v4 I get t-bagged and told to get good.

Ricer Meetup
---
another one when someone from your team is invading even when opposing team doesnt have loads of motes collected. Instead could be helping to kill and collect more for own team.
---
Stop giving these people free advertising.

Cayde would be proud of you

You might be right, I just noticed that IL looked similar when I felt nostalgic the other day üôÉ

spam "fire".

Depends what you use it for.

I read the quote in his voice, feels so good.
---
Dude.  
---
That armor looks amazing.
---
YES!
---
Yeah that little gap in between the chest piece and the shoulders is very noticeable 
---
I would run targeting adjuster, I doubt you will notice 1 difference in recoil.

This isn't an LFG sub.

Rule 13.

Check our LFG thread on the sidebar, and also the Team-up Tuesday megathread on /r/DestinyTheGame. (It's pinned on their sidebar.)
---
But idk if just the health would make it viable in most pve activities.. Even raids 
---
I would have to agree
---
Yeah.
---
Shit, well I'm boned, I picked up my last one on Monday, and didn't finish tell Wednesday.
---
Yes that would be nice.. + the overshield you get with Helm of Saint 14
---
Helm of Saint-14 isn't what gives you the overshield; that's the bubble doing what it does. Helm of Saint-14 blinds enemies that enter your bubble.
---
Oh right sorry, switched that up 
---
OEM ornament when?
---
No problem
---
Thank you! My bad, I thought subscribing to /r/raidsecrets and /r/destiny2 would be enough to know of everything game-related. Just subscribed to /r/DestinyTheGame as well. 
---
Chatter white?
---
That‚Äôs a good question! I have the digital copy. I‚Äôm sure the disc off loads a lot of information to the hard drive so you may still see improvements.
---
I appreciate your reply, thank you. 
---
The nostalgia!! If this actually happens I will...... i don‚Äôt even know anymore
---
I am a console player so yeah can't say with certainty for pc.
---
Alright, if your mainly a crucible player the campaign is still useful, especially for guns you can only get in the forge and dreaming city (retold tale, blast furnace, and hammerhead. And exotic hand cannons are also a grind but well worth it.
---
I can‚Äòt believe you people are defending ddossers... says a lot about this shitty community (by saying that my post will be deleted by admins anyways :))
---
Y1 iron banner cloak with a Y1 ornament. 
---
Since they have announced that they will rework Spectral Blades, Gwenish Vest had to be the exotic of choice to sell - so people who had been unlucky so far can experience the balanced super until it is reworked.
---
:/
---
HAMMERHEAD HERE I COME
---
Cayde-6 is only disappointed, because he got caught.
---
Aw too bad. Great transmog anyways üòä
---
This is what the scum of the internet looks like 
---
You can pay to basically get carried through the raid.
---
Solar
---
I know that but why the hell is it an advertisement for blatant cheating
---
I want to stab him in the throat so fucking bad.
---
It‚Äôs pretty sad if you have to pay to get through a raid when you can learn it easily.
---
Yea I thought it was legit for a second, was gonna and asking what glitch you found lmao
---
Witch-hunting is against the rules.
---
This is your only warning. 
---
How do i go about doing niobe labs? 
---
Yoinked the gun build from Cammy, I see
---
The Key you get from riven is weekly reset based per character. The one from the wish is once in a lifetime on one character. 
---
No, 'just' 20 I believe :)
---
Alright, thanks for clearing this up! :D
---
The wish key is only once. Raid rewards can only be earned once a week per character. 
---
They don't have to be powerful, but i think radiant. You have to obtain the obsidian accelerator before you can start niobe labs, iirc. Just look it up on yt, there a lots of good guides. 
---
Hello there
---
CaYdE dIdN't Do HiS DaIlY sTrIkE
---
Now thats the definition of a jebait. 
---
I think the Hunter emblem is the worst. The Titan and the Warlock are almost medieval, the Hunter is just a snake. The raid skull is also an option. Etsy is your place for all this stuff. Or buy a Cricut üòâ
---
I have been on the look out for obsidian. Will look it up
---
Don‚Äôt worry I did
---
Here, should I use khepri's horn barriers too?
---
Haha yeah I‚Äôm in the same boat. I‚Äôm at like 96% for primeval/envoy kills tho so I should get there in the next match or two.
---
Going with forgotten
---
golden gun has massive aim assist :)
---
Yes, I got queenbreakers bow and liar's handshake from killing random legionary during forges, it's just powerful drops have a MUCH higher chance of dropping
---
:[ thanks for the info!
---
It's you! Wow haha
---
Nice my favorite exotic x2
---
And some of us need medals. Gambit in the end is for gamblers if you win your gamble against an invader you get a reward If you don't the invader is rewarded. If you just want wins normal gambit is right there it does the same thing in the end. I hate when people say don't invade to an invader stop dumping bullets to the blockers to a sentry stop killing to a reaper and stop collecting to a God damn collector let the man do their job. If you're so good yourself you would've killed that invader right? Please go play normal gambit and let all the collectors sentries reapers and invaders do their thing 
---
Major issue on ps4 even with the pro.
---
But an SSD. Night and day difference when I played on XB1.
---
Selling them late
---
We're all tired of sweat, so we just wanted to have fun. This honestly was the most fun Ive had in months.
---
We're gonna do more too!
---
It was.. maby they won‚Äôt bring it back in destiny 2 but, since Bungie and Activision split up there may be some hope for destiny 3. It will make sense they would incorporate everything in destiny 3 because they have the freedom to do it now. I‚Äôm putting al my hope in destiny 3. This could be there crown jewel 
---
I've got it all + pass. CST.
---
I‚Äôve been grinding for months for the forsaken exotics because I am the unluckiest motherfucker
---
nope, not for the next few seasons at least.
---
Honestly if i were to play reaper i'd envision myself as a banner shield/bottom tree defender titan with actium war rig, breakneck and some other ad clear weapons, should be able to mow down groups.
---
I‚Äôm still waiting for a pinnacle sniper as well...
---
Riippp, that's gutting
---
The medal is to get 20 kills in a single life, it shows the requirement in the video
---
20 in one life
---
I've said a couple times that I want the original ghost shell in d2, you'd think they'd add it for nostalgic purposes
---
Better of with a good rolled kindled orchid, I got rapid hit and kill clip on mine and it shreds
---
yuuuuuup, really sucks
---
Really? You didn‚Äôt like them ? Why if I may ask. I really loved them. The raids had a kind of charm to them. I can‚Äôt explain it but it feels more mysterious to me. Even tho the concept of fighting a taken arkamhara is pretty cool 
---
I got the shader recently from shax he was selling it
---
I think Shaxx is doing a similar shader as reward this season if that helps at all
---
To bad man :( I hope the will bring them back one day 
---
The Shader is sold from shax but requires you to have completed the Crucible: Challenges triump, The triump is to complete the 5 weekly crucible matches for 6 weeks (just 6 weeks doesnt need to be in a row) if you havent done that you still have 9 weeks to get it before the season ends :)
---
You have to wait until next week when the weekly bounty to upgrade your synthesizer is available again. 
---
.... you got me there bro. Just don't be that one guy don't use the no fun allowed tactic I may have acted really offensive because of a similar problem occurring in a raid where they insulted my friend and sorry 
---
Yeah, that's pretty good, but I still think the best dialogue is from when Ikora caught Cayde masturbating( or at least the exo equivalent).
---
Ok, just added you. Thanks m doing random stuff but if you want to get something going, let me know, just shoot me a message. I set my status to offline, but I'm usually on, playing, so not me whenever. 
---
Yea i wish that the year 1 gear would have some random rolls or atleast static rolls so that they arent useless compared to Year 2 armor
---
I plan on creating both I‚Äôm questioning wish to do first
---
He has another line "You're the reaper now"
---
Having come from 700+ hrs of Overwatch my first thought on hearing him was, well that's reaper and it bugs me constantly.
---
Tbh novelizations and such are legitimate. Writing a screenplay off something visual is actually a good skill to have, especially if you want to make a movie. Putting what you imagine onto paper is a neat skill
---
When doing a session be careful of tilting as it can hit harder then you might expect, what i ususally do is i play untill i have lost twice and then take a break to reduce tilting and anger that might come from the blueberries (unless its the first 2 matches)
---
Except you can kill them then come back by the time they recouperate
---
Hey man, a bit late to your post but also in Italy, and also having cabbage stuffed down my throat. Did you ever end up with a new router and did it solve your problem?
---
But aren't there four bounties to do? I mean I'll wait til next week, but damn. That's stupid
---
Honestly I don't even find it slow. It one shots any red bar and most baseline yellows on a headshot with the explosive rounds. I'm very rarely shooting the same target more than once - if it can take more than one boe shot from NTB, two at the most, I'm going to be swapping to another weapon anyways.
---
It's just perfectly timed with my aim adjustments. I'm drawing as I move to another target and can release the second I'm on it. Dramatically lowering the draw time really wouldn't do much for me most of the time, since that eight of a second is the time it takes me to aquire my next target. It's perfect.
---
In Crucible it's another story; most bows are a two shot regardless of head or body shots, so you can use whatever you like. I stick with NTB when I need s non-exotic kinetic bow just because im familiar with it, but any will realistically work. 
---
What I do now is, I'll play the weekly required matches on all characters (win or lose) and I'll keep playing on the one I did best on (I have all classes) and if I start losing, I just take a long break
---
Yes, there are. But only one of them gives the synthesizer upgrade. I‚Äôm in the same boat. I agree that it‚Äôs frustrating but they have to put some measures in place so we don‚Äôt blow through content I guess 
---
Thanks
