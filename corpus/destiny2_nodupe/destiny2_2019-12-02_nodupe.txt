Looking like she's dealing bright dust outside Gaben's corner store.  This is a strangely robust visual metaphor.
---
---
---
Took me a year of practice with other games and staying off controller completely
---
Honestly try to get 1 other person to run with. Communication is huge in comp. Find a good loadout and stick with it. Learn the corners and if you cant find anyone to play with always follow a bluberry around. Having 2 people shooting at the same guy vs 1v1 is better.have to adapt to each scenario
---
Okay. Let's try to fix this.
---

---
1. Invaders are absurdly bright red. You likely don't see them because of problem 2.
---
2. You can invade using the portal near your bank, it looks like a vex portal. Invaders spawn normally across from the location the enemies are at. For example, in the EDZ map, there's 3 spots: Beach, Forest, and Buildings. If enemies are currently at Beach, then the invader is likely at Forest. If the mobs are at Buildings, it's a toss up between either spots iirc. If mobs are at Forest, they are likely at beach. Take this with a grain of salt, it's been a while since I've played Gambit, but this is how I think.
---
3. I thought the PvP aspect was sweet, it appeals to both kinds of people. PvE kind of person? Go around and kill things. PvP? Invade. It only gets annoying if you don't learn how invading works so you're prepared.
---
Hope this helps you out, Gambit isn't TOO awful. Also grinding out my Exit Strategy fresh, good luck out there Guardian.
---
Yup and don’t forget 21 delirium but I’m also using transversive steps with 100 mobility so I like never have to reload and be fast af
---
I’m a gambit god
---
I thought it was "your enemy can't kill you if they're dead"
---
Legendary
---
Let's try to be civil y'all.
---
Any one of these will solve this: 
---
* Restart the game.
---
* Switch characters
---
* Load into an activity
---
Congrats now multiply that hours spent by 8 and you get not forgotten
---
I only got one as well but remember to equip Drang so I could get Sturm.
---
Five of Swords has no effect in Ordeals, which are currently better than standard nightfalls except for strike exclusive loot, since there are 3 regular nightfalls vs 1 ordeal per week.
---
Don’t you ruin my fun.
---
That’s the one
---
There aren't really "builds" in this game. Leviathan is also mostly about teamwork as opposed to pure DPS like later raids. 
---
You should have a special weapon that is good for crowd clearing and a special weapon that is good for boss DPS, and a heavy weapon that is good for boss DPS.

if u like pve u dont play gambit bcuz u are forced to pvp, this is the biggest problem i see in it

I like the way you put it.

I really like my characters to look quite intimidating, I have only found one Legendary helmet I like the look of so far, but it's not an ornament and it is in the low tier for stat rolls, so I never get to use it.

Epic moment when that’s actually my name... and I’m running recluse...
---
A destiny raid is the ultimate friendship test.
---
Low key thought it was Onyx for a hot sec and was thoroughly confused

It'll either come around or dump weapon parts into Banshee until it pops.
---
Please be kind to each other everyone, regardless of pvp skill &lt;3

We're all still ~~people~~ guardians.
---
It really did solve it! Thank you! I thought i was doing everything wrong :)
---
The only crucible I have fun in is the one where you just run around with rpgs,gambits are fun down right,and patrols are boring
---
Most mods are just random drops from legendary engrams. Legendary engrams from NPCs also count, so try turning in materials/tokens.
---
White streak, speeds by

*YETH*
---
Stick with your team, always. Communicate if possible.
---
Play conservative so you dont use up all the respawns.
---
Dont let the other team get the heavy ammo.
---
Try playing at non-peak times.
---
Ever since I started carrying a Bad Omens with tracking module I've enjoyed it much more. Invaders always killed the fun for me. Now I kill them.
---
If you land everything it’ll break it but it won’t kill the titan inside
---
I loaded up my striker titan with Randy’s, Recluse, Hammerhead and OEM for one last iron banner lulz. Good times
---
Most of the time you will switch specs/gear/weapons depending on fights and raid comp. This goes for all raids
---
Got fighting lion, the cabal scout rifle and iriannas vow within a day of each other, they are all mediocre
---
Sometimes it's just a timing thing for me. If popping it now means I'll have time to get a second before the end of the match, I'll let one fly on a shotgun rusher or something.
---
velocity and clusterbomb, during arc singe when you need to quickly fuck over everybody over there... RIGHT NOW.
---
I dunno about anyone else that lives in Ohio but we ran these down kids throats I’m certain grades
---
I know what you mean I really like that Hunter helmet!
---
If you’re dying to shoulder charge in a smg grenade launcher shotgun meta then dude I have some bad news
---
Playing the meta might help, or playing Hunter with stompees, like the meta
---
I remember my annual pass wouldn't work so I had to uninstall it, maybe that might help? You can always contact bungie help.
---
Thank you fellow big brain
---
Yes, but the other person/account would need to buy the season pass. That is the only part that does not get shared
---
In theory they're cool and should work in reality they're fucking pointless kinda like that fake exhaust port.
---
Yikes!
---
Well you have my sympathies.  I sound like a complete ass when I'm playing too.
---
Oh I LOVE being invaded before even getting 20 motes banked! And then having it happen all the way until the enemy team defeats the primeval
---
And the sexy voice of Saladin in IB.

you can get it anytime.

Then I proceeded to kill Oryx, well, twice actually. Then the Red War came and I had to find Ikora Rey on Io and the taken were there. Now here we are in the Dreaming City facing a curse thanks to Riven, of a Thousand Voices.
---
Trying to have fun my ass, youre all tryhards, and OEM is only useful if you play like a bitch
---
Yeah whenever my computer gets a little warm i just dump a kilo on it then it goes into super duper mega overdrive mode for about 8 hrs

*blueberry invades when they re fighting the boss*
---
*blueberry got sniped*
---
*blueberry invades again*
---
*he survives but doesn't get a kill*
---
Knowledge
---
Same. Too much social anxiety
---
Gambit heavily relies on teamwork, which is unfortunate when the blueberries you're stuck with are actively trying to sabotage the team. And when you think things can't get any worse, the Invader comes along and stomps you into the ground with META weapons.

NGL didn’t know this.

I have all but 2 titles in game and 2000 + hours.

That’s awesome! I’m happy he’s a Titan. Stand strong brother!

the first time i did a black armory forge i saw a guy just launching balls everywhere like he got into a lottery or something... because it was raining there.
---
u will love it the difference is mad
---
Tiny titan in training
---
I say the nightfall is great farm because along with an exotic is either a enhancement prism or ascendant shard sometimes
---
It takes two to tango
---
I’ve only finished the quest on one character. I don’t play the other 2 in Iron Banner. It’s a free time thing lol
---
Don't get to attached to your ghost
---
Plus nothing grows on the statue if you pay attention to the details. The vines only grown around it.
---
I feel your pain. I submitted a "ticket" to Bungie's Help Forum about this problem. Based on my experience, trying to help a buddy of mine complete his objective for the Undying title, I believe a bug was introduced or worsened with Bungie's latest update. Which is causing Overlord spawns to be almost nonexistent for some players across all Vex Invasion locations.
---
Perhaps you can upvote and/or comment on my Bungie.net Help Forum post to try to create more awareness to the issue. I still have not received any response from Bungie's Support team about this. I wish there was a way to know that Bungie's at least aware of the problem and doing something to resolve it. Even if it means removing the objective as an Undying Title requirement, if they're unable to address it before the season ends in a week.

Logs in.

Solid thanks fam
---
Do you have a mod requiring certain percentage of super to execute? The artifact mods for finishers require super energy so if you’re below the threshold it won’t allow you to perform the move
---
Very true, went 0.1 one match and never went below 1.5 for the next few.
---
Momentum control is back on reset. that's best for grinding out the mountaintop.
---
no idea what the night falls will be though.
---
That’s great then since I’m using erinas vow and the new city SMG
---
Poncho? Yes please
---
How about every map not being vex related. I have a feeling they will be switching out maps for next season considering there's like 4 to go between.
---
oh you fancy huh
---
Are you standing 20 feet away??
---
Oof, the original reply was from the eyes of the taken knight, not the guardian*
---
Because all it takes is a shitty blueberry to ruin all of your hard work weither it be collecting motes or invading and taking motes/healing the boss
---
Exactly. The damage output of the best DPS supers can be completely diminished by one invader kill. It's silly.
---
Why thank you, and have a marvelous day or night.
---
By us, specifically. Since we're the ones that built it. So eventually we have to give it to him, so he can go into the infinite forest and die so we can craft it.

Then the Warlocks just have Osiris...Vex can have him

I didn’t even know that was possible!

Thrive in the fires, Guardian!

Idk if it’s the angle or the legs on your titan but he looks like the short Keanu

I can’t find it

This. Took me a few to realize I had one that created special ammo while doing a bounty that required finishers.
---
Casual or more hardcore?
---
all giudes and vids i have watched state mayhem is best for grinding out multi kills and the calculated trajectory medals due to all weapons doing more damage and power ammo more readily available...
---
Nobody forces you to go after certain guns. You decide you want them
---
Casuals like you are what's ruining the game
---
I’d swap gambit and crucible around, but sure
---
I personally don't like the gun and think a godroll trust is far superior.
---
Is it after you finish the final lost prophecy?
---
There ya go.
---
It’s just 3500 total glory, not reach 3500.

Oh, he's gonna love the golden loot.

strikes and crucible matches, don't expect it to drop though, the drop rate is abysmally low

You can keep your portable crayon restaurant to yourself.

I'm not sure you noticed but Foetracer is actually completely bugged. It only works properly a third of the time. It's nice when it works but most of the time the mark will disappear for no reason.

Next step, get him to join r/pcmasterrace

Want one? Don’t knock it till you try it.

If this is right then great,
---
The Destiny Wiki does seem to explain it differently though. [https://d2.destinygamewiki.com/wiki/Handling](https://d2.destinygamewiki.com/wiki/Handling) 
---
Do you have any evidence of "Readying" meaning ADS Speed, seems a bit weird to me...
---
I’ve never heard this before but it explains so much...
---
Yes, install D2 on the SSD.
---
It will say how to get catalysts in the character menu &gt; triumphs &gt; account &gt; catalysts. 3X3L is right, though I think it's important to know where info comes from in the first place.
---
That sword does fuck all to the actual Nightmares too, should have dropped it and just shot the hoe.
---
Is that gaben back there?

The game i went into next i started to notice it's inconsistency. I was on a lot of kill streaks the game before though. Got like 3.75 efficiency.

r/grilledcheese

Okay cool thanks.

Needing help and  asking how this is happening is low quality? Maybe you should rethink your job as a mod.

I do all three

A Danksouls meme?????!!

i rarely use warlock , but im pretty sure the seasonal artifact has something to do with it the current spam right?

Go to destiny fashion and you’ll see plenty of mando hunters

It's gonna be like an old battleship; the gun fires, the captain checks his pocket watch, tick tick tick tick, about an hour later a tiny speck of light in the distance... Ah! Right on time.

I don't actually follow that subreddit, but I'll mend that. Thanks for the tip!

No problem

Already got the PC built and ready. Baby steps.
---
Thats awesome! It would look killer and be crazy functional! Well Good Hunting Guardian!
---
looks great!
---
Our first 980 attempt, we took like 40 minutes because my dumb ass forgot to put on the Overload grenade mod &amp; our only Overload Rounds guy kept not disrupting Champions.
---
We also died about 17 times, but we still got 100k
---
I'd love to check out the build, would you mind to share some pics of it?
---
 Now now, some Titans may eat crayons in sandwiches, but the smartest Titans have developed ways of cooking them in soups and other dishes for maximum crayon intake. It is easier to drink a crayon than chew it after all, keeps it from getting stuck in your teeth
---
Yeah it's really great with bows or mida multitool since that will give you radar while foetracer gives you the mark. Used to be the meta back in year 1.
---
Oh it's nothing special. It's a supper rigged together old monster. It's got an AMD FX 4350, and AND old Nvidia 8600 GS. Gonna start him on retro pc first.

Just play Gambit, it’s a lot more fun, *most* people don’t use broken guns there, it’s a lot more chill

3D printed? Or molded using...?

That concept art is pretty cool. I gotta run VoG again.

Nice!, the catalyst helps a ton! I got my lion catalyst done pretty early on in that grind for mountain top and it made a huge difference! good luck!
---
Mobility doesn't affect sprint speed. You'll be just as fast at 0
---
Sad thing is, sometimes you get blasted because of net synch issues.  I have had more than a few runs on that damn strike where I go through at the right moment - no electric bars are present, and I just die.

Also kills with a sword that has no ammo count as melee ability kills iirc.

I used to be one of those people. Then I started raiding more than once every 3 months and saw how many people enter a KWTD lfg group without knowing what to do and became horrified at the thought that those people are still more observant and skilled than most players.

GTX 1060 I run medium settings around 80 fps 75% render scale on my 4k monitor. It does great. Waiting on my 2080ti RMA.

Why doesn’t the sparrow match?

You spoke some truth there....
---
Ahh shit
---
You can just find an exo engram from anywhere for it to count (I got mine from a strike). Not sure if buying one from Xur counts as picking up an exo engram though, as it technically is a fated engram
---
Whats your steam? I can add you there
---
Some people don't use their headphones or run subtitles, they find it distracting..
---
They already announced that they are upping the drop rate to 10%. I got mine after my 4th run and in my clan we just keep 1 character with the final boss checkpoint and do it 3 times in a row. Then wait until next week and do it again. I’m sure if you get the check point and save it every week it’ll be much easier to fill your group.
---
I need to go on the lfg more often honestly, i like helping people and i dont really have that much to do
---
exactly literally only thing u would need to teach someone in this game is raids teaching that u have to kill envoys first is basically same thing as teaching ppl that u have to kill the last boss in strikes to finish it lmao.
---
if u cant figure that out ur literally braindead

I hate prime I always get the team that can’t even make it to primeval phase.

I love this :,)

How? I’m just lonely and jobless...

I was farming the pulse and kept getting the scout over and over again, some of them had okay rolls but they’ll never beat my vouchsafe

Titans being the most hated class might have some truth to it, especially since there’s a huge Titan/Hunter beef.  But, Warlocks are the least played class in the game.  It’s been like that since D1.

That honestly all I’ve been doing until the season ends, and pinnacle quests

That's the one

---
It no longer has to be in the same season. You just have to get 5 resets in *a* season. The quest step will complete when you get there.
---
thats usually after u play this game for a while who tf turns off sound or never put on headphones when they r first playing that game
---
This is normal. This is how the game works now. Forges are on a daily rotation, you don't manually start them.
---
Xbox. And that player base is mainly toxic, so I’m trying to change that
---
Yeah, the chance of that happening is basically zero. Unless you have video of them all freaking out about it, this didn't happen.
---
Yeah fair enough, we could be reddit buddies if you want
---
So far there has been 0 indication as far as I know it has been made unavailable or that its drop source has changed, so I would guess it is still available and you are just unlucky.
---
I actually got last word today and I am loving the shit out of it. This is the only hand cannon (except rose) I will use for a long time. (Mainly till I get ace or thorn)

---
Okay thanks so much
---
ok
---
Her maniacal laugh makes even Shaxx tense up 😉
---
If we're talking Handcannons then i have to say that the Ikelos is my number 2 eversince i got Ace Of Spades
---
All good bro.... I wasn’t one of your down votes... 🤙
---
Damage numbers don't really matter much between different game modes, because your power level fluctuates (the game scales you down if you are too much higher than the recommended power level) and there are still a number of number artifacts from before the New Light upgrade. Also some enemies just take less damage (especially with shields on and you are shooting with the wrong element. Even worse with the Match Game modifier)
---
Whatever, there's still like 130 armors I can't get from the collection book, so I need to keep them, I counted them myself, there's alot.
---
It looks really great. But if i would take a Destiny tattoo, then i would do only one circle with my favourite class (hunter ofc).
---
A Grumpy Waffle, what a cute name 😭
---
Nothing turns a boy into a man faster than grilled cheese and D2.

Sorry :&lt;
---
That's what I'm planning to do, but the husband plays all classes
---
you unlock the planets by simply just playing the story, id grind that out for levels then after that move to PvE things like nightfalls and such
---
I like it. Very Vmex
---
Use void subclass+ recluse with shield/anti barrier Mod + the void helmet that gives nade Energy Back for the devour buff
---
Ok
---
Just wait until you find out the real world has guns too!
---
And, you have another week to get to 100. Just do EVERY bounty available and all powerful/ pinnacle weapon rewards (they give big chunks of xp too). You’ll get the ornaments in no time. You should have a couple already honestly. Check your inventory tab to unlock them then apply them to your armor 2.0
---
Thank you, I’ll do the main story first.
---
I see what u did there.Whichever u prefer :-)
---
It's the portal to the black garden on the moon
---
not a problem :) the game doesn’t do the best job in terms of telling you exactly what you should be doing to progress, but it’s pretty simple once you get it down (which won’t take you long at all) any more questions you can just message me!
---
The only way to get better is to practice.
---
You learn the maps, with their alleys, death traps, and most importantly how to engage based on your load out.
---
Play to have fun. The winning comes with time and a bit of matchmaking luck.
---
You need to kill a specific boss on normal for the quest.
---
As a Hunter main 👍
---
I see no god here other then me . Top cyclop saying
---
Oh.. yeah it’s modded though.. right? It says you have a Mobility mod in it. They give it +10 on stats. I’m fairly certain the max drop is 60, un-modded.
---
Still an awesome roll and way better than my 48 one.
---
Yeah but it dropped at 70. The mods do not increase stat unless you masterwork it
---
Last word/hc and snipe is also pretty consistent combo too though (body snipe for last word/hc clean up). Apparently the problem with lucky pants is that enhanced hand cannon dexterity pretty much outshines it, being a mod rather than an exotic. I’m unable to personally confirm (have never seen enhanced hand cannon dexterity), but the draw and ready speed of hand cannons is extremely quick enough with enhanced hc dexterity that it makes lucky pants irrelevant
---
You're psyching yourself out.
---
I find that picking a fellow blueberry and sticking with them aids hugely.
---
On every item I use, adding a mod increases it’s stats by 10. Unequip it and check!
---
Maybe the settings are different in our game or something.

If I remember right you need to wait at the platform where the Vex are right after the short jumping section right before the battlefield. Most of the time one would just run past the vex and therefore miss the tank spawning in.
---
I know right?

Well what about Cayde-7?
---
I wanna keep playing this game even when I’m 80 years old grinding my ass off to get the best loot till I die 😂

Maybe I should have put Shaxx in since he wants to see us fighting

Same here, it sounds like we got a long time til this game will die out

I hope it never dies out destiny is such a masterpiece

After what your ghost says about the thousands of dead vex... did you see the mountain of vex parts next to the body/shrine?  Pretty cool.
---
A short time, yes. But in the right hands, it's amazing. Sadly, the dumbass of the group usually gets it.
---
It’s a shame we still can’t reroll the masterworks ... 
---
Make it cost 10 cores, I don’t care, it just makes me sick to see such a sweet roll with a useless reload masterwork.

The odds of getting that same roll with the right MW ... I can’t even imagine it.

I'm talking in destiny lore wise. Most guardians were bunch of bones who could've been psychopaths for all we know.
---
wallhacks simply let you see through walls, not damage
---
I just checked my storage in the app, but there is no Rose. Pretty sure I lost it when I received Lumina. I will do some research.
---
You can let an enemy kill you, should tell you the recommended power at the top right. But yeah, things like osiris you're probably gonna do different damage amounts than the moon, because the moon is so much or a higher level place. It has to do with how much health something has as well
---
Thanks for the tips. Yeah situational awareness is a challenge for me. I have issues some times visually picking targets from the background. Probably due to my bad eyesight and ADHD, they seem to blend in until I catch them moving. I went back and watched the recording after the match and saw what you are talking about. When I'm actually playing it's harder to split my focus like that, but it's something I'll work on.

Regardless of who was what. Unless uldren proves himself to be a true Guardian he can eat a couple bullets from the ace of spades. Also, Uldren wasn’t a hunter when he killed cayde therefore he couldn’t have become hunter vanguard. Even if he did “get” the title. We or Petra killed uldren so he no longer would get the title.
---
thank you. discovered the menagerie yesterday. thought it was a full raid you need to have a clan for or sth.
---
Man Imma help this man through every raid he needs
---
Thanks

Just checked: you lose the Rose, but you can recover it from the collections:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/c8fd6b/will\_i\_lose\_access\_to\_the\_rose\_once\_i\_get\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/c8fd6b/will_i_lose_access_to_the_rose_once_i_get_the/)
---
You do, not enough hours on your titan.
---
Are you guys still looking for people ? I am interested !! Recently got shadowkeep and forsaken. I am a level 915 Titan and play casually because I have my University and student job to care about. Lemme know if you guys will still like to recruit me !!
---
Your mother's failed abortion is cringe.
---
Because ew, that's why
---
That gamer tag is awesome
---
Op, please be a good dad gamer
---
But not the jotunn/bygones type please teach him right
---
god i hope to find someone who enjoys playing games with me. 
---
godspeed guardian.
---
Yeah, assuming not confusing the two together...
---
Higher light activities. Look for anything with a "powerful reward" like strikes, completing some number of bounties or playing so many pvp matches. All of these "powerful rewards" (it is labeled in game) are available once a week and easy to get solo and will drop up to 5 above your current light. 
---
It will easily carry you up to 950 (then you need pinnacle rewards which are kinda hard to get)
---
i’m in class rn so i can definitely relate.
---
from looking at it yes, might need to tweak some settings. Playing on lower graphics actually can improve gameplay by helping remove some clutter. It can provide a huge advantage for you.
---
Once that boy gets synthoceps, it's all over.
---
P.S. shame about the Iowa game last friday.
---
That’s one exotic no one else is going To get
---
I still hate Zavala since the forsaken campaign.
---
Thorn quest is part of Forsaken.
---
Did you never wonder why tho???
---
pretty sure you pick it up from benedict or something. i know you can collect the quest line from a vendor. maybe it’s the drifter
---
He's a bot. Look at his comment history, it's literally only "No.".
---
He pissed off a couple other people on this post.
---
I love obsolete patterns!
---
jötunn is 10 times worse than erintel imo
---
Has to be higher than what your infusing it Into, base gun is 901, to infuse you need something higher than 901
---
One of the worst posts I've seen on this sub, which is saying something
---
they arent
---
Ouch 🤕
---
Do you...actually use orewings maul or is it just left overs from IB?
---
Calm down. Just relog and you'll get them.
---
Left over lol
---
Now this is something I can get behind lol 
---
Congrats bro I'm both jealous and happy for you :D
---
Aaah ok lol
---
Not broken. Be patient. When that happened to me, I just x’ed out of the game, got back in, and it was there.
---
Watch a datto video on YouTube he explains the process well.
---
Yup. Need Forsaken for thorn and lumina, they are both at that campsite.
---
Ahhh this was wholesome.
---
Ok boomer, but seriously it gets outclassed by several weapons that aren't exotic sooooo.
---
Shut up virgin
---
i want to forget about that expansion after prometheus lens in crucible and having to grind to get sagiras shell. i love EoW though
---
Thank you.
---
You guys are like us, but flipped. My missus plays Hunter, I play Titan. Whenever she agrees to do PvP I end up doing so much better than if she's not on my team.
---
At least let us kill him again. Bongo plz
---
Scourge of the Past is the shortest and, in my opinion, easiest to teach. Even my sister who hasn’t raised since D1 caught on really quickly. Most of it is shooting with minor puzzles.
---
Yes. Have to do it this season though.
---
Just wait till he gets OEM
---
Try [this link](https://discord.gg/jc3qn6)

For the warlock one wouldn't the rift and well already heal you.
---
Yeah. I love last word, but ace is far more iconic. I'm not even going for using it, I'm getting it out of respect for cayde.
---
Byf ultimate lore master
---
Tbh I don’t really know either lol. I gave people a template and they used it I guess lol
---
Yes sir
---
Too bad he can’t be a Commander
---
No
---
it remembers that you reached legend so you don’t need to do it again just get your 205 kills with luna and you get your NF
---
Can confirm, Destiny at 30fps is unbearable after 100+fps on PC
---
Even though he’s a simple Specialist, he’ll make it to Commander one day. I believe in him :)
---
lol
---
I really like Byf as well.  And Myelin.  But I need all the lore vids I can get! :)
---
U must be lonely.

Laughs in Titan

I literally made this super late Sunday and have to go to college now, somehow I woke up lol

Boomers and Millennials are different things btw

Also not a gif... 😅

the arc web will continuously chain from teammate to teammate until there are no more left to chain, too far, or line of sight is broken, or there might be a timer (not sure about this one)
---
no, I'm a virgin!
---
As a titan I feel that we are the worst class of pve
---
Pvp you’re correct we are pretty strong
---
Oem will be nerfed and so will recluse so maybe things will get better
---
As for pve the only classes we have that are good are the ones with shoulder charge like top tree hammers
---
We don’t have many good exotics that aren’t easily learnable
---
I half agree with you
---
Then play a titan and stop moaning
---
OK, thanks guys.
---
a ghost called Pulled Pork came around and Re-alived him
---
Make swords great again
---
Synthoceps? Nah. Fast shocky boots all day
---
At least you got the key mold, my quest glitched for me
---
No way you got it too
---
Lmao i can taste the salt
---
🥺 G O A L S  🥺
---
its still okay for dps in raids if you dont have much else. its usually bugged after a new expansion and you can use it to glitch out anykind of arena style mode such as when forsakens blind well came out. in that you would shoot it at tje ground and when it exploded each projectile boosted your score by alot.
---
wait
---
Ah, a fellow Titan! Join us and grow with us! The reign of OEM is coming to a close, so you shall be more powerful without it's temptations!
---
Is anyone else wanting to see the power weapons slot now
---
the term is "new light" now, fyi :) congrats!
---
Everything looks fine to me
---
Shaxx disobeyed Zavala during the Battle of Twilight Gap
---
Wouldn't have ever know what the hell *Brexit* was if I didn't Google it.
---
It's such a nice shell! Haha it's been my favorite from the start. I finally accomplished a dream getting it for my main~
---
See what’s funny is we can understand both sides on this one.
---
Me too, it's my favorite.
---
The ultimate pyramid scheme
---
Dunemarchers with mid tier solar are excellent
---
Agreed
---
Zavala is following protocol (like he always does) for the good of the city and traveler. I guarantee you, he has hatred and anger built up. When he sees uldren, zavala is either gonna snap, go into the old tower and cause massive destruction, or die a little inside. I would love to see zavala step down and see him kinda go into a pilgrimage kinda mood and leave the tower and understand why things are the way they are. Have maybe shaxx or Saladin take over for the vanguard a bit. Then have your guardian guide and help uldren understand what it means to be a hunter vanguard.
---
Whisker Biscuit Boop, Muff Buff, Axe Wound Surprise,  Getting kissed by Homer Simpson, Puss Pound, Poon Pound, Stink Smash, Tampon Torpedo

Lots of names, some better than others.  I’m particularly fond of clam slams, and tampon torpedos.

If you like using swashbuckler and threat detector I’d use it it’s an alright smg

I agree!

That’s what I did

In theory, but that's a lot of extra steps there. I would just gift him the playstation network cards so he can buy it and not have that headache.
---
Ok hunter
---
damn this is wholesome as hell HAHAH love the first clip :")
---
It's true
---
Hate to break it to you, but I don’t think curated Vex Offensive weapons drop from any source. You can’t rely on light.gg or similar websites—it’s not uncommon for light.gg to list a curated/fixed roll for random weapons that are simply unobtainable. For Adhortative especially, it doesn’t even have the last perk column filled out, leading me to believe that it is a false positive. Also, I have never gotten a curated VO weapon, nor do I know anyone who has.
---
Last time I glitched out of bounds and got to throne room it didn’t trigger for me
---
I just got it and I honestly love it

Shaxx: Am I a joke to you

Yeah based on demographics by genre in other games, it's likely somewhere between 5% and 20%.

It's averaging 100k players on steam, so at any one time there are literally thousands of women playing this game.

A minority for sure, but not a rarity.

I watched this cutscene on the game itself? After I did an ascendant challenge or something with the dreaming city.

Thanks. I'll watch it when I get home lol

I always considered it like some sects of religion which require you to tithe some of your earnings to the place of worship. See baptism. You tithe some of your pay to the church and this gets sent up, the more you tithe the more influence your church is etc. 
---
Baptist’s don’t give you a sword though. 
---
Worst Wednesday ever.
---
But I wanted to see if the super breaks the bug.
---
As a titan I admit I love to throw the occasional shield wall up to block my wife's heavy. It usually results in the wife look and several rounds of Gambit. Worth it just to bug her.
---
3...2...1..PEREGRINE
---
Are mods letting anything be posted now?
---
So true, the main difference is that as a Titan main, I'm probably going to run it with ward of dawn instead of striker just so you can still get overshield from melee's
---
Good work. Makes me wish I made a character an exo
---
Damn you, Pulled Pork!
---
i see . my quality was a little splotchy , i suppose . i'll see if i can get a clearer screenshot from my console , instead

Thanks for the reply! Just seemed like a silly rule to me, like if I were gonna take a screenshot to ask a question on a forum, I doubt I'd otherwise bother learning how to do that directly instead of just whipping out my phone real quick lol. Makes sense though. Peace!
---
Been playing as hunter since d1, it's the most fun you can have
---
I mean, you could. But we are feeling like posts that are just "Look at these names" are getting old pretty quickly, and often get removed on that basis of being low effort, and often the case, not that interesting.

I'm just not comfortable relying on a sniper until I get better gun skills. I usually run a hand cannon/fusion or shotgun/ and a rocket launcher or my Hammerhead LMG. Maybe a grenade launcher. Sometimes I will switch out my HC for a pulse rifle like Bygones or Outlast or Go Figure etc or an Auto-Rifle like Sweet Business or Breakneck or the Galliard from Black Armory or the Hard Light in the energy slot. I'm actually a huge Auto-Rifle fan but they aren't very good for PvP in my experience, for me at least.
---
ah , alright . i understand then
---
It looks like your laptop has 128 MB ram (which should mean it is so old you can't even load Destiny) but you have virtual memory turned on to convert hard drive space to RAM memory when needed.  If you do that would explain the vram.  The computer does not have enough RAM to work, so it is using unused HD space as RAM.
---
Foe tracer can help with thorn's dot.
---
I typically use stompees for everything pvp because the boost in movement and mobility is great
---
Hold up I didn't see the sword before lmao, thought he was slamming wish ender lol
---
While I think that’s on by default in my computer. That explains a lot thanks!
---
Talk about titans chemtrails.
---
I'm a D1 day 1 Titan myself. Started pvping with my Hunter last season and my Warlock this season. Titan is still my main, but I like them both.
---
Hunter + Stompees is like playing a different game.
---
Warlock + rift is surprisingly survivable and I find I can hold zones almost as well as my Titan.  Also - I don't know why, but I get far more kill streaks with my Warlock. In PVE the Warlock is much easier to solo content with.
---
https://youtu.be/it6qi6LOoD0 this showcases some little tricks with the subclass and super
---
I love mid tree Sunbreaker &amp; Dunemarchers but that but I think I’m in love with the chunky slap of the uppercut hammer
---
I main a warlock, but have all three.  
---
Light lvling is much faster with 3 (each character can do all reward activities, and since weapons are shareable they increase the light lvl faster).  
---
You have versatility when playing with a fireteam.  Sometimes a warlock well is needed, sometimes nighstalker with rigs is the way to go.  Depends on what the team needs as to what I run for a raid/dungeon/activity.  When EP first came out no one really needed more than 1 titan on the planet, and that was only if he was going to run melting point.
---
Did you use the Obsidian Crystal? Went into your inventory and held the interact button to use/consume it?
---
I have a feeling my bf and I are gonna have similar interactions once we both get on D2 together. (He plays PC and I play on console)
---
In addition to him constantly running off a cliff.
---
Also tell your gf that she made the right choice maining a titan! 👍🏻
---
Just give Uldren an ugly helmet and change of clothes. Then let me introduce him to crucible.
---
Aye
---
ehh...I've seen Cammycakes clapped by a Jotunn more times than I can count.
---
I have yet to join voice. I feel like once I got back into the swing of FPS this is what it seemed like.
---
This one speaks to me, but replace roomate with Raid team. As the only one in my clan that really really gets into the Lore, i end up just telling stories to explain why we are doing what we are doing.
---
You joke about this but the Unyielding Terror and the redlight machine in the Zero Hour mission have made me yell out in terror more than a lot of horror movies have in recent times.
---
No.......
---
The Unyielding Terror always seem to appear whenever I'm low
---
Lol people have been complaining about knockout’s interaction with thunder coil constantly, it’s not underrated
---
It’s always nice to see positivity and respect in the community, I feel your pain.
---
Why would you want the OS on the HDD? That’s going to slow down everything
---
No sadly they used to be a thing but not anymore and I don't know if they are planning to add them back
---
You can in audio settings, turns off the ghost too. Silence is golden
---
It feels good to be the yacht
---
yeah that's the good stuff right there
---
Honestly just the campaign alone feels great to play through. Had all the prior expansions through forsaken, bought shadowkeep last night and ended up calling off work today. NO you don't need it to be competitive, but you should absolutely get it for the content.
---
If you win a game at 5500 your guaranteed the catalyst because that’s how I got mine

I agree with that I love how the gun looks and the sound it makes. But everything else including the sights I don’t like. I’ll use it in non vital pve stuff because it’s fun to hipfire with.

Ok, this may be garbage but I'll try.
---
The Hive philosophy and power was given to them by great, powerful, Darkness-serving worms in the depths of Fundament, their home world. Their central tenet is basically an extra-violent version of survival of the fittest. The universe's "final shape", according to their philosophy, will consist of the single most powerful being in the cosmos after he/she/it consumes everything else in violent tests of strength and will. It is the duty of the Hive to help the universe assume this final shape.
---
So they're religiously bound to kill and destroy everything in their path, and anything that stands up to them is a mere test that must be overcome.
---
Oryx and his siblings each received a worm as the source of their power, becoming part of themselves. The worm feeds off the power of its host (which is gained by destruction and killing), and as the host's power grows, the worm gets hungrier. This quickly became unsustainable. 
---
So Oryx set up a tithe system, from the thralls on up: every Hive takes the death energy it needs to feed its own worm, plus a little more to grow, and passes the rest on up the chain. This allowed Oryx and his family to survive past the point where their worms should have consumed their souls.
---
A river of tribute flowing up. In other words, a pyramid scheme.
---
Apologies to any fellow lore nerds who take exception to anything I screwed up or glossed over. This shit's *complicated*.
---
So the quests don't though. So Randy's is still attainable per their own comments, so is Edgewise.
---
They are primarily on the moon and are used to open chests from what I have done. Never noticed them anywhere else except there.
---
You’re probably not aiming it correctly then. Also light level doesn’t matter in PvP.
---
Only seen this once. My reaction was the same....wtf? Havent seen it since
---
Momentum Control is 10x more fun than Mayhem and should be a permanent game mode.
---
Definitely. 
---
Get into iron banner for the wins. They count for more percentage and it goes away Tuesday.

They're also on Titan and Mars. They never lead to anything though...
---
Lol, it took a long time in iron banner to get them kills.
---
*Expands list of Wars with the Cabal on Mars*

best - shader - ever!
---
If you prefer to get one. I’d say get forsaken. It’s got way more content and is more bang for buck. Unless you’re a stickler for new content.
---
I know about those - the ones I'm talking about are red and will roll around after you shoot them. There are a ton on Titan - coincidentally, there are also a ton of hidden worms on Titan.
---
If I am correct you can get it from either the legacy campaign or already in your collection
---
Very awesome
---
Yes, you can get the weapons just not the title.
---
I don’t get why some people just, expect the raid to be done? By then showing up not knowing anything? I’ve joined some raid teams where the other 5 members knew nothing.

Yea.. most people hit 1 golden shot and that's hit

Exactly, call me a crybaby titan screaming what about wormhusk crown but that OEM shield doesnt stop Mida from four tapping. Wormhusk does. I think OEM is just another casualty of crybabies ruining things.
---
Mind you, it isn't a crutch for me. My favorite exotics for PVP are Synthos and Doom Fangs.
---
Thank you good sir
---
Fantastic- thank you! Is that why they came to the solar system? Cos they was hungry bois?

if you think about it the hive are just one big pyramid scheme with the worms on top giving a promise of power to the now hive in exchange they 'recruit more people'

i’ve  dealt with it a lot in d1, plan c. the fireball is definitely not slow but definitely not as fast as erentil however erentil doesn’t have the range like jötunn. i personally would rather deal with an erentil than a jötunn.

Awesome
