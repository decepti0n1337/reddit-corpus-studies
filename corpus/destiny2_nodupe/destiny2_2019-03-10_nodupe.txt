A titan that didn‚Äôt shotgun or shoulder charge you I don‚Äôt believe it lol

---
Where is it 29.99 at? I've seen 39.99 almost every where I've looked 
---
I want this ghost so bad, he just looks so cute

Were you falling as you took this picture? XD

Drifter has catch up bounties to get you to 640. Grab those 
---
don't forget Sunshot!
---
Yeah, one that isn't just useful with clanmates.
---
My Chattering Bone is godly. I have nearly 10k kills with it. Rampage/Outlaw/AP rounds and range masterwork.
---
You hit him with the classic ‚ÄúNo u‚Äù
---
Are they still good against the primeval? MGs got a nerf against bosses this patch, so I‚Äôve been running wardcliff instead. 
---
Agree. And the only ones who are worse are the ones who tell peiple how to play.
---
They're downvoting for the hell of it.  Neither one of us said anything that was fictitious or illogical. I honestly believe that everyone who downvoted simply have Bungie's dicks in the mouths and don't want to accept that Bungie is an idiot company that makes stupid decisions all the time.
---
They‚Äôre ok. They‚Äôre waaaaayyyy better in PVP tho
---
First thing I thought was it looked like an SR-71 Blackbird, a lot closer than Nebula ship. That‚Äôs why I want it.
---
Yes this new gambit prime and reckoning is no joke, but keep on the look out I think during the season of drifter they gonna have a day when everyone gonna be able to do everything. 
---
Titanfall 2 is a superior fps and then we have a game that everyone is playing only because "battle royale". Brings nothing new to the table.
---
Same man! I got it yesterday and I‚Äôm in love
---
Are you also completing Nightfalls and Raids? Big power ups in those
---
Almost always max LL or slightly below (~50 PL)
---
What is the context of this picture/video?
---
Were you having a stroke mid picture? 
---
His pauldrons make him tallest
---
Is that Yu-Gi-Oh? Are the numbers their health? I would guess that in combination those 5 cards do a lot of damage. Never heard anything about it, just guessing.
---
That ghost is from a while ago, don't think it's available anymore.
---
Too little to notice. 
---
Thank you champ :3
---
What did y‚Äôall think would happen?
---
Oh boy, this is giving me flashbacks to D1 days.
---
Those are Tabi's,  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jika-tabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jika-tabi)
---
Still happening, said I dropped 3 motes twice and I was very much alive and killing Fallen. Ended up saying I dropped 11 in the match breakdown screen...kinda sucky for stats lol (In normal Gambit)
---
Why shouldn't a Titan be speedy? Titans don't have an inherent toughness advantage in _any_ of the lore or game modes.
---
As quake player I feel this meme
---
Right! The game is no fun when it‚Äôs all close range or long range, no mid range play at all lol
---
 You mean the brick ghost
---
yeah I would gladly keep Ikora alive but kill zavala and his ghost
---
But his actual hight makes him the shortest
---
Bro Shazam is taller then everyone 
---
Right now there are a TON of bugs introduced in the latest update, but they mostly affect late and end game quests and progression. 
---
Forsaken, the expansion that came out after Curse of Osiris and Warmind, fixed *a lot* of problems with the game. Unfortunately, you need to actually buy Forsaken to benefit from those fixes. If you don't have Forsaken it's only slightly better than before. 
---
I don't think there's any good reason to not jump back in now, unless you want to wait for Forsaken to go on sale. 
---
I don't think it's attainable anymore 
---
Except it‚Äôs not, hunters have throwable melees and warlocks have overcharge grenades 
---
Well at least you can trade in real life 
---
I'm finding this out right now being 18-0.
---
How much you wanna bet hes on Xbox
---
I only do that, if you're going to be an ass to me while on my team. You want to be an a Jack wagon to me behold what kind of evil I can possess
---
Name checks out.
---
I prefer the escalation protocol shader.  Reminds me of the fact that Rasputin might just decide to screw us all.
---
so i cant get it just because bungie couldnt fix their "forged in fire" badge claim in time?
---
10 is the new magic number, captains are broken with their teleport spam, shields and attacks that go through walls with the chance of 1 shotting
---
Hey just wanted to say, this exact issue has come up already in a destiny podcast and plenty of people feel the same way.
---
Ignore the smart asses who feel the need to defend the game against this beneficial piece of feedback.
---
I probably would have felt the same, but I had to do a massive post breaking down how this all works, so it was pretty clear to me by the time the expansion launched.
---
Bungo done a stupid when they dropped the new season hence I been spending the last week just levelling new characters til they fix this shit and I can go back to making progress on stuff I‚Äôm missing 
---
I love it 
---
I absolutely love the design, but man, that line-work isn't the greatest.

---
Ditto!  Got my Alienware 120hz 34 inch ultrawide in December.  I love it so much... Lol
---
I've got all three at 650 ish power. 
---
I think Titan is the most well rounded. Can do well in PvP, PvE, Gambit, etc. Lots of great builds and exotics. Mostly superfluous in high end content, except for top tree sunbeaker with Hallowfire Heart.
---
Hunter is meet in PvP imo. Mayhem, sure, blade barrage away. Otherwise.. eh. Super fun for solo content, super useful with top tree Nightstalker and Orpheus Rig for any team PvE content and Gambit. Same for bottom tree Gunslinger and celestial nighthawk. The former is a fantastic debuff, the latter is highest burst damage in game.
---
Warlock is my current most used class. PvP is dawnblade bottom tree with sunbracers for me.  Definitely good, but Titan is a bit easier to use. Warlock dominates PvE. If playing solo or regular content, top tree void with Dire Ahamkara Skull destroys. Still decent in PvP. For high end content (raids, Gambit prime, etc) middle tree dawnblade, well of radiance shenanigans with Lunafaction Boots, sunbracers, or Starfire protocol is basically required. A lot of people also suggest middle tree Arc with geomag boots. I don't have that exotic, however. It does seem well balanced between PvP and PvE, but again, not first hand.
---
Thank you for this
---
Maybe‚Ñ¢.
---
Is it 39.99? My bad, I was trying to recall these prices from memory without actually looking them up. 
---
Guilty. I love every second of it. Hit a wall, wait around the corner until you see all the pretty X's show up, go back and mop up.
---
Two things I'd like. Unlockable sights and the ability to change the color of the sights. I'm partially color blind and I don't even use the WotW because the reticle is near invisible.
---
Yes. There are 2.
---
I'm a casual player.  The move from 600 to 650 takes a significant effort.
---
You assume people in Gambit Prime are decent
---
Dude, stfu. Yes. I have a PC. And no, I don't want to buy a console. I have a friend that plays on Xbox and has no PC, but I still wanna play with him without having to buy a brand new console, just to have inferior quality and controls.
---
I rejoiced when Fortnite got the cross-platform update. It meant that I could finally stop using Keymander and move to a fully dedicated system. I want that same experience with D2.
---
Oh ho? Youre shotgun rushing me? Instead of running away youre skating right at me?
---
Here‚Äôs some tips shotgun pulse is good combo or fusion. Hand cannon bow or sniper. Don‚Äôt go alone and revive teammates. Know when to use your super and control heavy ammo. Wardcliff is probably the best heavy.
---
Is it just me or does BB sometimes go through walls and obstacles in crucible?
---
I can see that, but I don't see the point in leaving two or three sights on the gun when your just going to be changing it and that's a perk slot that bungie could use for something. How about this instead of 2 or 3 sights it just spawns with a random sight in the sight mod slot then you can change it from there. Easy fix you still get to change the sight, it opens up a perk slot for more perks and your not having to deal with iron sights. Because having three separate sights already on the weapon then changing it just makes the whole process redundant and pointless
---
Yes we need a good exotic AR I dig it
---
That was my go to for the crucible 
---
Never too late, PS4 user? The games are on sale! üëçüèº
---
You should've seen them before the nerf
---
Even then. I think it would be cool with cross platform but if they can accurately AIM good i'd be kinda disappointed...
---
how do repeat on reddit? *Please I want this playing in the background I need to know*
---
You match a couple Goblins with a Knight, though? Good luck.
---
I'm always surprised at some of the out there memes people on this sub are aware of 
---
The sooner you get it, the better. You can still enjoy the game, but you'll be lacking certain exotics and weapons that will improve your experience, so the sooner you start the grind will help.
---
Yep, 100% 
---
I'll bear that in mind, but I'm giving up for now. As someone else in the thread said, there's too many people that are high skill level starting from 0 right now.
---
I stand no chance, so I'm just not going to keep trying against the impossible for a few weeks. 
---
Hey now
---
Dont knock it till ya try it
---
Nothing wrong with it
---
You do you
---
Im gonna do what i do
---
And talk aboot it how i talk aboot it
---
If you buy all the new DLC, by the time you get to endgame the bugs right now will be fixed. Vanilla-CoO D2 was horrible and boring, but it's much more better and enjoyable now definitely. 
---
C O N T E N T
---
Hunter fun police.
---
Screw faction rallies altogether and just give us back the D1 faction system. 
---
Congratulations, good sir. I'm still grinding for mine. I have a love/hate relationship for the grind. I just hope I like the gun. 
---
This is fuckin fantastic holy shit, well done OP
---
We still have a few weeks until Joker's Wild is fully fledged out.
---
Honestly, vanilla D2 is horrible. You don't have much else to do now except save up and buy the Forsaken bundle :p
---
Just go see xur. Your problem will be solved 
---
I got a rust punk shell with mercury scanner as the random perk, so depressing.
---
I want my khvostov god damn it
---
If you got one during warmind you can get a random rolled one through turning in tokens anytime. 
---
I just got these super hyped they look great 
---
I say blue. 
---
*house of wolves intensifies*
---
Then shoot them first lul. Nightstalker dodge gives invis. Well of Radiance warlocks get healing grenades or a shittin of nova bombs. Defender titans get bubbles and shields. Really not that hard to get sniped if you take them out first, and if you can‚Äôt kill them just play defensive with the things I just listed
---
Good job. Now continue what you were doing and try to get 21% delirium 
---
Meme forever, Guardian!
---
Try dodging it
---
Soon as I saw HH I was instantly meh. Most unimpressive.
---
 Love it and its perks! Wish something like that would happen!
---
Lol at this rate you'll get all of your Forsaken exotics via Xur.
---
Do your powerfuls!
---
Yeah that Titan exotic is something awful. Sounded cool on paper 
---
Yeah it was not easy but I enjoyed the challenge I worked on the Chaperone quest at the same time and it just went very well (with the occasional setback of like 10% of course).
---
I just can't imagine that people are really that bad in crucible that they're stuck at like 20%. I mean it's basically pvp only at a higher difficulty setting with intelligent ai
---
like seriously we had one good exotic and DeeJ must have had a fit when fought against it in crucible so je had it nerfed
---
How is using emotes after you kill someone toxic? Man the destiny communities logic astounds me sometimes with their virtue signaling.
---
I certainly didn't imply perfect frames don't exist. I know it's there, I've hit it once or twice. Since I've tried to replicate it though, it's hard to bill off as just server lag. 
---
For me it‚Äôs the cyclops. Never fails to tag me across the map while I‚Äôm in (what I thought was) perfect cover
---
You need to hit 50 i believe
---
&amp;#x200B;

Thanks I‚Äôll run opening mission to forsaken should get me there I‚Äôm about half way through 48 so fireteam medallions should get it done 
---
Gambit wins are currently not counting for many quests.
---
Why? I've been killed more times I can count just trying to pick up blues... just pick everything up and you'll be fine.
---
My power leveling strategy has always been mayhem, which is currently up rn
---
I was about to dismantle it but I didn't have a decent void crowd control weapon for singe... guess it gets another shot 
---
Gotta spank those motes
---
Seeng
---
Just been matched into the game. And its 95% of the time.  
---
I was thinking of trying izanagi's burden or j√∂tunn next time I squad up for Gambit Prime
---
I understand teabagging considered toxic, but emoting? That's why they are there. Might as well consider trying to win toxic, cause "we're playing for fun, not to win!".
---
Turn vsync off of its on.
---
Yeah, but this was done on Xbox, you can do it it by pressing the super button and then immediately pressing the Y or swap weapon button twice. I play on bumper jumper so super is A and makes it easier, while maybe not as good as PC just wanted to show it works here too. Also yes Gladd's video is good on it.
---
i'm mary poppins y'all !

Welcome to September 2017 guys.

Yep, there is, rule34 has some and xvideos as well. Not a lot of it on the good ol‚Äô hub tho, at least from my ‚Äòresearch‚Äô.
---
Of the few times I ran with teams I found it best to run with only 2 people plus you and make lower glory host. Helped a ton . But unfortunately for us solos it‚Äôs hard , but if you need help, I got like 3 guys in my clan actively trying to get Luna‚Äôs currently. I‚Äôm working on NF so I can be of assistance too
---
Punch a guardians balls.
---
He's yee'd his last haw.
---
It‚Äôs supposed to make you give up dawg. That‚Äôs why people make these memes bitching bout it cause they couldn‚Äôt handle the grind. I had to remind myself I wanted it. Now you grab yourself by your junk and man up Guardian and get out there and get that gun. So you can look back on posts like this and be thankful your one of the few who could stick it. 
---
LEVEL UP! IT'S A STEP FORWARD!
---
So what word should I use?
---
"Strong" sounds better
---
OP just calls for nerf
---
You are right about that. Going to edit that now. I don‚Äôt want this gun being nerfed, it‚Äôs too much fun.

Is there any kind of lore explanation as to why most golden age-branded stuff tends to be full-on sci fi (like fusion rifles and jet bikes) but so much of the ruined world from the time of the golden age effectively looks like it‚Äôs basically modern day?

I‚Äôm actually 666 Light rn.
---
2 AFK.
---
Emote is one thing, teabagging though. That's a mental play lol.
---
Whether we wanted it or not...

To me emoting is fine, when you teabag me though, I'm going for your headtop.

I must've gotten that one when gambit first started...
---
It was the first drop I got this season... I just kinda sat there a while
---
I've played close to 150 matches of Gambit Prime and Reckoning have not gotten one drop except for the quest reward and underpowered armor from the Reckoning except for my weekly this season so far is a complete disappointment and joke I have never had to grind so hard to get no reward once again this game disappoints me tired of being disappointed by this game and their Developers division 2 launches next week bye bye Destiny 2

Dont you dare put a warlock with the vanguard, what would toland think??

It's not cheating. You're simply doing enough damage to the boss during this phase to negate mechanics. It's no different then popping everything when you first come to a boss and killing it before it can transition into the next phase.

Say it with me bois. That. Is. *Nasty.*

Guys quick question is this like a cutscene or a trailer or something? Cause i cant find the original
---
Yep, that‚Äôs the next task lol 
---
Nope. I learned that the hard way. Played like 5 games and kept wondering why none of stats were going towards Breakneck. 
---
Negating mechanics is by definition a cheese, therefore cheating the encounter. Try again
---
 By lag, do you mean teleport? 
---
It totally is!! Especially with Onslaught too. As long as I keep killing, it speeds up everything. Shot. Reload. Handling. It‚Äôs unfair lol
---
The plight of the solo player... I feel your pain man! It's very frustrating. Tried to get Lunas solo last season. Got to 1800 glory but due to concerns with my mental health I had to just stop playing haha

It can be done on console without a macro as well, you have have to keep hitting your super button then change weapons then super button then change weapons rinse repeat.

This makes sense bcus I did just update windows a few days ago. If this is the case is there a fix ?

It thinks your inside the dome. The same teleport will happen once you‚Äôve finished the public event there.

That‚Äôs interesting that it‚Äôs deep enough in the circle at that exact spot though

It isn't but fare-thee-well,the auto rifles you get in the EDZ , and the Crucible sniper are. Also a few submachine guns, Hard Truths for instance, seem to have a few parts scavenged from AKs.

Why is this a meme? Where did it come from?
---
When you have 9 motes and a teammate steal the last mote you need and you hear blockers and invaders 
---
 Blyatiful
---
This happens alllll the time !!! Ridiculous.
---
Good luck getting your dredgen tittle , I suggest you get it by playing with clan mates / friends 
---
I‚Äôm not having issues on my end, I actually managed to solo the first round of Volundr when it kept giving me empty lobbies. 
---
Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm coming from: In the Taken King, the grind of strikes, Nightfalls, raids and Crucible were all impactful but also enjoyable. 
---
Now playing Destiny 2 the only parts that I enjoy are things like Lost Sectors, Strikes, Wanted Bounties, Ascendent Challenges and Flashpoint because they offer unique experiences that are enjoyable. 
---
But that‚Äôs not how you level up, no you need Crucible, Raids, Nightfalls and Gambit. A senseless grind through terrible Sandboxes, overly competitive Gambit matches (like why have matchmaking if you will never win without a team?), Curse of Osiris/Warmind or even Exodus Crash Nightfalls, and Raids that offer no real reward for the only exclusivity of the rewards are cosmetic (no unique armour or weapon perks). 
---
So when you are finally given new content that offers unique experiences like Forges and The Reckoning that bring players like myself back to the game, you just want to play it. 
---
So technical issues on top of just terrible teammates just make an experience I was ready to explore unbearable. 
---
Hey man I‚Äôm not frightened by a little white ball. In my mind, Warlocks are the obedient, rule-following type. Plus Warlock is my second favorite main so it‚Äôs gotta be on Vanguard because I probably won‚Äôt play my Titan. I really don‚Äôt care what she does.
---
I just want the khvostov back

You‚Äôll probably only get Thorn from the Drifter and the second exotic this season from the Vanguard.

I think most of the taken are easy to beat but the captains and goblins piss me the fuck off, goblins just make everything immune and captains have a regenerating shield and teleport way too fast, being a sentry in gambit is probably a nightmare without heavy or jotunn

or just make an exotic which makes you able to surf off explosions and take less fall/impact damage from hitting something. 
---
I dont get how this got this many likes
---
Better then a shot gun when the perk is active? Better then nf in energy slot?
---
You mean the spawn part with 5 minutes to get the match going?  Do you sit out in the open and just die repeatedly because you have no grasp of the concept of cover and how to use it?

Allow me to introduce you to walls.  Get the fuck next to them.  Corners are your best friend.  Enemies that lose line of sight with you can't kill you nearly as easily.  Stop being a dumbass.

I just can't get a game that isn't currently half way lost already. Seems like all the new content is only playable if you're in a pre-made group.
---
You've heard of knife-gun now get ready for knife-glove
---
I play on PS4 and I found that lining my reticle up just a bit above the gun before he draws helps me get the shot then move left or right depending on which one to shoot next. 
---
Within the last five years.
---
Yeah, I know what it means, but I can also understand why people could think otherwise, since for some time people used it as an insult, not a challenge.  
---
Literally, people would say things like "I will crush you and teabag your noob corpse" or something like that. They never threathened to "emote the corpse" though.
---
Solo shattered throne then hmu. 
---
I‚Äôve never heard of the pantomiming rape thing but sure I can see that I guess. My point was that it‚Äôs a video game and you shouldn‚Äôt be that emotionally invested in something that has no direct impact on your physical being. 
---
Yeah I get pissed sometimes if I‚Äôm on a losing streak but I just take a break from PvP if that‚Äôs happening. I understand teabagging or emoting is something people do when they‚Äôre owning you, it‚Äôs a good feeling to be destroying another player  because who doesn‚Äôt like some friendly competition?
---
Can we get an F for all Warlock mains
---
It‚Äôs a video game. In no universe would that be acceptable in real life‚Äî this isn‚Äôt real life. I pretty much never t-bag except for 2 occasions. I‚Äôll only t-bag if they‚Äôre my friend and I know them, or when someone t-bags me first. Besides that, I simply don‚Äôt do it because I know some people get get very annoyed at it. Personally I don‚Äôt get annoyed or anything by it. It‚Äôs just a game. It‚Äôs the emoting before emoting was a thing. 
---
No one from Bungie visits this sub.
---
Just FYI. 
---
That's a screenshot of Xurs inventory
---
I think its new from GP
---
I would assume that the fusion rifles and jet bikes are very expensive, rare and difficult to create. With most of the world(s) destroyed and golen age tech fairly pleniful, it's now easy for our guardians to get them. The Guardians would probably have priority of this loot as they are a large part of the City's defenses which warps our perspective.

As for why the architecture looks the same, why not? The Golden Age lasted about 350 years but if we assume that our current designs for architecture are very effective then the designs don't need to be changed too much. I never played Destiny 1 so I can't speak for Russia but the EDZ is in a very rural area. Most resources would be invested in cities such as the Solarium on Titan which *is* high tech.
---
Or there is always Baken, he isn't human so he doesn't count... https://youtu.be/f9UJ8AtNB8w
---
Thats just a lie. I don‚Äôt think anyone has played 150 matches of GP yet lol
---
Similarly I'd argue that emoting- even dumb, taunting, overused ones- at least represent the character doing it so it flows better.
---
That doesn't mean that I'm not gonna kill you for that "chicken dab" you invented, Bill. 
---
Do you have all or any of the DLCs? 
---
Just don‚Äôt take the insult to heart is my best advice. Someone flips you off in traffic? Well it did me no physical harm, just laugh it off because escalating gets you nowhere.
---
The point was it‚Äôs just a game that has no impact on your physicality. If someone literally punched you in the face sure, but an insult doesn‚Äôt have to be taken. Like the old saying goes, offense is taken not given
---
I messaged him about this and he replied, turns out he only has a flip phone, that's all he can afford according do him. 
---
reset ur rank
---
Only if we get a custom reload with bolt release slap and chamber checking.
---
Good point.
---
His ghost found him. It is time to reclaim the tower and defeat dominus ghaul. Be brave guardian.
---
Go to the tower. Pick up everything you can. You will be 650 by the end of the day.
---
Oh it was a genuine question, just so I can help him/her better :) 
---
I hate crucible. Was playing a couple rounds for so e quest and on my second round of Lockdown I the "1" in a 1v4. It happens. I've also been alone in the forge multiple times.
---
This brings back memories.  My first game with my new 21 inch monitor someone did this and I can still feel the hatred consume me. 
---
good bot 
---
That part was the biggest pain in the ass of the quest.
---
even the illicit set? 
---
May or may not have given someone this achievement...
---
It‚Äôs a time thing. You can see how much time is left if you stand in the glowing ring. That‚Äôs where you get primeval slayer 
---
Does teabagging count?
---
Pm'd
---
A big time streamer Ninja was accusing people of stalking him on Fortnite and killing him just to mess with him. ‚ÄúStream sniping‚Äù. 
---
He had a big hissy fit love and for the days afterward. 
---
So if I‚Äôm not playing too well it‚Äôs not mean to other players
---
I have still yet to get a pillager so I feel you man lol
---
Since it's only one round, it feels a lot more casual to me than normal gambit. At least for the time being. 
---
Yeah I feel you I didn't get the dreaded venture until my fourth reset it was the last thing I needed for dredgen
---
Tine for a fucking crusade 
---
Isn't half of Instagram stolen memes without credit?
---
Haaaaaaaaa
---
It can be, but you will most likely lose. It's a highly competitive gamemode so playing like every other blueberry in the game is possible but irritating to the people who actually care about winning. Then again, if they care about winning they probably shouldn't solo queue in the first place. 
---
Grandma's are badass. Like (the post,not my comment) if you agree.
---
? Warlock is the fastest class in the game, titan skating doesn't exist any more and Warlocks have wordline skating/sword gliding lol 
---
If you are not playing well or give your best, it's always "not good" in a gamemode where (unlike let's say strikes) your personal performance actually matters.
---
But as long as you try to improve and do your best, it's perfectly fine. Just don't go in with a "I'm just playing casually, it doesn't really matter to me if i do well, i'll just get less points if we lose, whatever", because that definitely **is** a shitty move.
---
If you're using an eleite co trolled you could just set your paddles up to jump for you but number jumper is an amazing control scheme. It's soo nice not having to take your finger off of the anologoc stick to jump.
---
That's how I've got it setup. With the exception of reload and action, every button has a finger.
---
Reset is in \~12min, so 45min from when you posted - not 2 hours.
---
\*laughs in Last Word\*
---
just try to get close enough to melee me, i dare you
---
Idk you do you man. Honestly there's far more important things that Bungie could fix before worrying about fixing a cheese method for a single part of an old raid.
---
You know what would have been even better?
---
If when you went into the ascendant challenge, you did a fade to black and opened with Skyrim opening üòÇ
---
how did you manage to typo two times?
---
I won a match with trust, bad omens and bygones, no triumph. 
---
You are fucked /s
---
I feel if you‚Äôre buying them from Xur for 97 legendary shards you shouldn‚Äôt get a duplicate. In fact I thought they fixed this. Smh
---
ADA1 will give the two weekly bounties, but the weapons are not powerful if you already completed that this week.
---
Ada offers 3 weapons a week. Hammerhead is in the rotation, you just have to wait for it to come up.
---
*cries in movement speed*
---
Nah, what about getting sniped by an Abomination when you have 15?
---
Right here brother 
---
I don‚Äôt even care if it‚Äôs exotic, I just want an M4 in game.
---
Yeah I agree. There‚Äôs been matches where it looked like a loss against stacks but we managed pull through. Actually Prime gives more chances to change the course of the game since you can feed blockers after they have prime summoned,  but then you create hell for opposing team. Need good invader though to stall as well.  
---
*laughs in slap*
---
Shatterbones - Exotic
---
 ‚Ä¢ Reduces fall damage by %80 
---
 ‚Ä¢ Some other shit idk.
---
Flavour text: *Ironic, really*
---
I'm sorry for offending you. 
---
I have female clan mates and friends that can mop the floor with me any day of the week. I respect them, and enjoy playing with them. I get really upset how women are treated in gaming, and yes, I want to tell douchebags to shut up. I realize that they don't need me to stick up for them, but it's also not up to the women to change the fact that the men act like little boys ‚Äì it's up to the men to stop their toxic bullshit. 
---
I stand corrected.
---
But how do you know?
---
*cries in malfeasance quest*
---
Haven't completed Ada this week, but the bounties for ascendant challenge have me a powerful reward. 
---
Totally agreed. It‚Äôs a fucking game, if people are getting that mad in it for certain actions they‚Äôre probably not used to having friends or we‚Äôre bullied and really do have fragile egos üòÇ and here come my downvotes. Reddit is full of these stupid people.
---
I teabag because the emote button's on the other side of the keyboard and I'm spreading salt in a Bungie game. Normally because you started it.
---
It may take a bit, and you may need to reload the location. 
---
Choose the vanguard. Honor Cayde. We almost succumbed to the darkness but we forgave Uldren. Don't become the drifter.  Even his title is sad and lonely.
---
We had a 20 point lead because I was whoring the heavy tbh
---
ya but it still hurts to get Orpheus rig again
---
Be a bit more patient, and watch your attitude kid. 
---
It's on the char select screen right next to the char you want to boost
---
Yep, I certainly understand you. Still got Gwisin and Galanors missing in my hunter collection. :(
---
facts
---
A lot of people said it took them like 50 tries to beat the last part, I did it second try woohoo!
---
Yeah, they buffed its pve damage on bosses by 110% I think. A little too much of a buff i think
---
Haha Someone hacked mayhem? I've been in a few hacked gambit prime matches recently, the only way I know for sure one of them was is because we had a huge lag issue on our team and one guy in the party would not stop screaming about cheating, so i messaged one of the other teams players to ask if they had the same problem and rather than just saying yes or no they blocked me.
---
What is this nf that people speak of?
---
I havent done much with it yet but it's definitely different from the hand cannons I'm used to. I like it though
---
Depends on what you want to play in Destiny 2.
---
It won‚Äôt. D1 throne was a pain in the ass
---
Fus...
---
Not Forgotten.
---
Yeah anything. I want to do leviathan raid though 
---
yeah it cool and different but from my experience the recoils is a little much but i got you used to it 
---
Yep. Any amount is good, really. I wouldn't bother infusing anything until 600 power though, especially since the power cap is now 700.
---
Don't have it but not really that excited for it. I love my grenades and like zoning instead of mediocre bonus damage.
---
The only reason the last part took me like 10 tries was because it was being super buggy, so twice when I got to the end it didnt actually complete so I had to completely restart and on the full reset it worked on the first try. If it wasnt buggy I would have had it in 3 or 4 tries.
---
It feels good to finally have it because I had been staying out of crucible until the other day because I didn't want to lose progress, but then I got shards and hopped into mayhem and upset quite a few people.
---
Do you need shards of gallanor to do this? 
---
A lot of the Gambit quests and triumphs are currently bugged. Try again Tuesday after reset.
---
Type your user name and choose your system go under checklist it qill shiw which ones you are missing. 
---
https://www.d2checklist.com
---
The last stage was a little annoying, I guess theres a bug where it doesnt complete when you do the 3rd draw, I had to completely restart it to get it to work.
---
I'm not.  I believe it is annual pass related as it already shows up in the Collections page but theres a new unknown under Power.  
---
Shooting it from the hip seems to have less recoil.
---
On vertical ground Warlocks are way faster, ur just bad at it if ur slower. Either way, it wasn't about what's fastest, it was bad reddit players not knowing Warlock skating exists. 
---
Lol nice. I haven‚Äôt seen an exotic drop from a public event chest since y1, was wondering
---
Aoterra said it was gone thats all I heard lol 
---
Thanks time for me to Google search destiny 2 not forgotten.  I never take my subtle calamity of my characters.
---
Gambit hackers are rampant atm in PC. So many stack scooters that can just bust the immunity shield and blow em up instantly.
---
But yeah scripts get into mayhem too and it's real annoying. 
---
Didn't even realise, according to some here I'm now a no talent bell end. I'm just a casual player...thought It was fun as fuck.
---
If I see one more post about a 666 piece of gear.............. 
---
Something like 70% of the player base plays hunters as a main, 20% warlock, 10% Titan. 
---
Given the dominance of Titans in crucible, this may have changed somewhat. I reckon that a lot of the crucible Titans are alts though, not mains. 
---
Luckily enough I finished the crucible step in two quickplay matches using MIDA and the Mini Tool (before smg buff). I'm glad it was just kills and not like kills with a specific gun like the D1 Chaperone quest needing Last Word kills. Never got that gunüòÖ
---
Ro...
---
You started it boy. I dont need to watch shit, stop trying to flex " authority " on the internet.
---
Crazy thing is I haven‚Äôt seen a single exotic drop from a PE chest since Y1, either! I‚Äôve gotten 3 exotics all Y1s from destination chests that spawn randomly. I normally don‚Äôt go for these unless I‚Äôm completing a bounty, but now I‚Äôm scrambling to open all of them to see what I get next! :P
---
Nope. Not here.
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 13.
---
/r/Fireteams 
---
#ShitScrubsSay
---
In all seriousness, my favorite way to shut down hate mail is to reply with ‚Äúoohhh yeah, talk dirty to me daddy‚Äù
---
Shit gets REAAAALLLL uncomfortable after that
---
Try LFG teams, I've only had a couple bad teams through the app and even then one of them played well, they just didnt take losses very well, basically any loss would make them go to the tower and rant about cheating and how the game is garbage, but when they're winning they're pretty fun people.
---
But did you see a post that was an exotic engram?
---
Is this still not patched? If so, how do you actually do it? I tried jump-super-switch weapon and it didn't cancel the super. 
---
I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a triumph where you have to ddos a whole team in comp. 
---
You don't repost just because you didn't get an answer. That's not how it works. 
---
New challenge: Wipe the enemy team using a Kinetic sidearm. Yeah people can get pretty salty when they get killed by something a lot. Like me getting killed by a max range blast furnace flinching me like crazy.
---
Like the very first gun in D1 and how they added the exotic version.
---
If you want the guns you have to do certain things and/or win in Gambit Prime and then armor from Reckoning.  Gambit Prime has a much stronger focus on ability I feel.  If you can play casually and still actually collect and bank motes, kill blockers, kill envoys, and stand in the well then yes it can be played casually.  However if by "casual" you mean just run in and shoot things and hope you get good loot then you're not likely to get any of the good loot without doing the mechanics and winning at least some times.
---
It sounds like some steps have optional methods of completion, probably an attempt to cater to all types of players.
---
Hmmmmü§îü§îü§î got a clan?
---
This is why my friend refuses to do Gambit with less than three people
---
You can do the same with the titan sword heavy attack
---
Goddamit my phone made me do a new comment thread.
---
Yeah same
---
Do 40 strikes. 
---
40 Strikes. It a Season 6 Strike Achievement.
---
Without context I thought I was in the Warhammer 40,000 sub/r.
---
Enemy team melts Prime evil in 0.001 second
---
That's what happened in my first match 
---
That‚Äôd be a Kinderguardian for us
---
I like it fairly well. The arc soul is fairly powerful and lasts for 20 seconds. Fun to play with but not really a top tier as far as exotics go for the arc lock .
---
Fair enough i was unaware of that rule my bad. And thank you for the info.
---
Check the kills on that
---
As a titan main, it is sadly true. The only benefit titans have in endgame activities is melting point. Oh how we fallen from the days of D1 bubblebros
---
I bag invaders I kill just because 90% of the time it seems to make them look for me 1st every time they invade...I usually kill stuff and dont grab motes so if they are chasing me and not my teamate with 15 thats a good thing,and when I kill them again its so fun to emote them and know they are losing their shit. I dont let bagging or emoting get to me,but so many people do so thats why I do it,a lot of people dont play very good when triggered.
---
Thanks guys
---
Good idea
---
Yeah that might work
---
Yup
---
What quest? What are the details?
---
Can you explain what this means? Do you just run strikes until your medallion runs out?
---
Can't get back random rolled gear.
---
well yeah but i‚Äôm taking in a PvP view. hip doesn‚Äôt go that far
---
I'm on xbox and came a cross a couple, im glad I'm not on PC now.
---
While I was looking up methods of cheating on console so I would know better how to spot it I came across a website that actually sells aimbots, i had no idea that was a thing.
---
Yes
---
A worthy addition. Maybe Sammy Jackson himself???
---
Boof*
---
"Should not have come here..."
---
Exotic quests shouldn't require a different exotic, I'd be so mad. 
---
I've never been great in crucible so mayhem was very helpful in getting that all done, I got the medals in a few rounds too, just spamming blade barrage everywhere.
---
Especially given I get five in about three seconds. I clear a wave of adds, I get way more than five
---
Heh‚Ä¶ I completed that "on accident" by just playing Gambit. Other players got all of the medals for me. #leachstyle
---
Did you not see the upgrade that golden gun got. You can keep firing along as you hit your targets
---
FIRING TRANSMAT
---
So how do people get random rolls on it then?
---
Owo
---
Thanks!
---
Thank you.
---
I haven‚Äôt been able to so far. Pin collecting is not as popular here as it is in the States, and Destiny pins in particular are very niche (if I was a Disney pin collector it might be a different story). Best I can do is to try and sell my unwanted ones and then fill the holes in my collection using eBay.
---
Literally one Jot√ºnn shot, same with old Phalanxes actually, which is why I never understood the ‚Äúonly send fives‚Äù tactic previously either. I get some people are that stupid that they don‚Äôt know how to shoot the toes, but if you‚Äôre not that stupid, it‚Äôs literally one shotgun, one sniper shot, or one fusion shot.
---
Oooh
---
That's be cool with a dragonfly or rampage spec.
---
Also the borealis. Great sniper, just because it's exactly like the hardlight, but without so much distracting muzzle flash. 
---
Its the Quests to unlock the 2 Forges that drop from Vex and the Fallen. My friends got the quests in like 5min after the first 10kills. 
---
I killed hundreds of mobs over the last week in the same locations they did. I even cleared the lost sector in which one got the quest over 30 times. Also in all the guids in yt and so it says the items to begin the quest should drop after the first few mobs. 
---
I got noting in 2 weeks. So i am 99% sure its bugged. But i want to unlock the weapons from this forges and i dont feel like leveling a new charakter to 50 just for that (not even sure if it would work)
---
Also no one could help me yet. Seems like no one knows what to do and no one can help me till now. So i just want a GM or so to send me the items tbh. 
---
After that comes ding, ding, ding, ding, ding
---
Np
---
It's glitched. The triumph counts the number of times an orb of light is generated (meaning that it counts 'X person generated 4 Orbs of Light' as one) instead of how many.
---
Sure but then i have to wait like forever to do it again!  
---
Where is my golden retriever !  My return of hammer time!  Pole dancing tip jar!
---
;)
---
Nice, what set is this
---
RIP, wouldn't be bungie if something like this didn't exist
---
How do people get random rolls service revolvers
---
Some powerful rewards are bugged, Bungie are aware and have a hotfix for this in the next update.
---
Ok thanks
---
That‚Äôs cool
---
There‚Äôs no ‚Äògood point‚Äô that comes with outing yourself being sexist, what‚Äôs important is you recognize it. She‚Äôs not good at the game based on her gender, she‚Äôs good because she‚Äôs a beast AND she happens to be a woman. (They‚Äôre not mutually exclusive.) In fact, that‚Äôs what makes this entire exchange (almost) funnier, as the enemy player called her a f*g, and likely assumed she was a man. That person assumed- just like you did.
---
I was thinking about trash-talking the guy back for losing (perhaps a little to stick up for my friend, but it was nearly entirely selfish, because I am competitive and I hate sore losers trying to rag on my buddies I‚Äôm sharing the glory with).
---
So yeah...don‚Äôt assume you have to stick up for someone because they‚Äôre female. They‚Äôre not weak and frail. They‚Äôll whoop your butt.
---
Edit: misplaced earlier comment. Apologies.
---
Oh wow I didn't know they stacked, thanks for the tip.
---
Not enough tentacle.
---
An A for effort, tho...
---
No, i have not, but thx for every  replie. i will inform bundige about this
---
Maybe if your final shot was like a grenade/rocket launcher and you start dancing or something immediately after firing but before the 'nade blows/rocket hits?
---
Because I don't have that much. I played a ton if crucible in D1 and not all that much in D2 and I don't play nearly as much as I used to. 
---
Just thought it would be fun to do this and to highlight others.
---
So you wanna play comp
---
how do i get a spec of one of those?
---
I agree, and especially ever since Forsaken they ALWAYS seem to release ‚Äúrustic‚Äù looking armour. Just once, can we get some pristine looking stuff? Like I wan Petra‚Äôs outfit. The eververse stuff looks close tho. :
---
Console? You are just bad.  
---
Pc? Probably a hacker
---
Nicely done
---
That looks like a 3 sta k who where meant to be on your team quit at the last minute when they saw another stack on the opposing team. 
---
Thanks, PS4 btw.
---
Even as a destiny player I dont get this
---
Also, as a Warlock, if you get an elemental charge or an Awoken relic, you can melee and then immediately jump. It sends you forward with nice momentum, comparable to Destiny 1 Titan skating.
---
Drifter? Naw, it's Dredgen now.
---
Congrats! I love mine, but I‚Äôve actually run out of ammo a few times cuz she gets goin‚Äô so fast, so be careful 
---
Breakneck is best by far, but one that I‚Äôve recently been using is the Duty Bound (Savath√ªn Song NF) I got rampage on mine and I‚Äôm in love with it.
---
Gambit Prime just needs a fine tune. If you spawn your Primeval first, it is like a 99% chance you will win.
---
That‚Äôs why I run a ghost that speeds up summons
---
Really? Those are a thing?!?!
---
I NEED IT! 
---
Not long at all, part of the new update are bounties that will get you within level to play new endgame content 
---
Lunafactions on a Radiance lock are kinda silly. 100% rift uptime if you've got a friend, means never having to reload any of your guns.
---
It‚Äôs actually added before then too. I‚Äôve only done 4 strikes and a Nightfall, and I have a 658 Service Revolver
---
I agree. Visiting the sub made me realize how bad things had gotten, which would have taken me longer to realize had I not read anything there. I started anthem during the content draught before season of the drifter but now I don't really have a reason to play anthem atm. I'd rather play comp or farm weapons in reckoning. 
---
Ol' yawllerhorn??
---
Saying Gambit Prime is a bad gamemode because the people who play it are bad is incorrect, that's just a fact. An opinion would be "I don't think Gambit Prime is fun because I never get paired with a good team" is an opinion that is neither correct nor incorrect. I so get what you mean too but the player base has nothing to do with the quality of the mode itself. 
---
Under: Crucible ‚Äî&gt; Lifetime ‚Äî&gt; Glory ranks
---
Yes, there is a random roll perk for ghosts called speed demons. It decreases sparrow summon time and reloads weapons while you ride you sparrow 
---
Not too long of a grind. There are bounties now to increase you to 640 rather quickly. You would just have to reach level 50, and you can do that by simply playing through all of forsaken. 700 is max light right now just raises from 650 last tuesday.
---
Depends this seems pve oriented. Alot of your c class give incredible neutral game.
---
It has to be a FULL set of Gambit armor. If that didn‚Äôt do it, then the quest is bugged
---
This. I tried my ass off last season and only got to heroic 1. 
---
Love the post apocalyptic drifter look 
---
That‚Äôs supposed to be your character. I‚Äôm pretty sure we‚Äôll see them with the thorn quest
---
about as dumb as exploit abusers. 
---
Yeah hes pretty bad sometimes especially when your about to melt with your super and he tethers you
---
Actually had more dupe exotics last week than before. 
---
I'm not familiar with that feel in Crucible. I did get hate mail in Sparrow Racing once though, that was uplifting!
---
It's usually referenced in the quest step, but yeah I suppose we'll see.
---
That requires a 666 Better Devils and one's firstborn to be sacrificed.
---
situationally useful in pvp though since you can hold a perfect shot and wait for someone to peek/round corners 
---
It should be a re-creation of the original Thorn quest. That wizard was a bitch.
---
I got to heroic 1 last season in the day of the reset. Couldn't make much progress since the teams I met had at least 2 people with Luna's or not forgotten.
---
