I was working on my account completion before I realized that was a waste of time do I incorporated destinations and that's near impossible because I dont spend enough time farming for exotics

---
---
Didn't specify why he's stupid. I think all the media coverage and the last 10 years would explain why I called him stupid. This is just extremely minor icing on the cake. Stop assuming please

If that's true, I take it back then. I am a little bipolar from my mom's side of the family and I can understand how that might make you a little crazy. Only after going on medication that I actually managed to level out.
---
*first world problems*
---

---
Probably the dumbest one I've seen this year too
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills
---
Breakneck, one of the most trying grinds I’ve completed. Getting the EP shotgun to drop was worse because of you know, rng.
---
Yeah I feel ya man, curse breaker is locked behind RNG for me. Can’t seem to get the ghost shell to drop.
---
Thats the thing, you cant
---
No worries at all. Cheers pal! 
---
From my experience they do require communication and for the list idk where you can find it. 
---
Thank you. Is there matchmaking for all of the non raid activities?
---
What in-game thing do you get? An emblem?
---
Crucible pvp
---
Rumble(free for all)
---
Control (hold positions)
---
""  (Team death match) /idontcrucible
---
Gambit pvpve
---
Fight mobs and other players on a 4v4 team mode
---
Pve
---
Strikes (3 person missions)
---
Quests
---
Story
---
Raids (do require communication but not very much if you dont wanna)
---
Plz no bully just because it’s a gun meme
---
I made this awhile ago 
---
Thanks! Is this game more of a pvp or a pve game? I always thought the pvp was just a side activity but its fine either way.
---
You chose both are equally played
---
Take a photo with a piece of paper with your username next to the artwork. 
---
Great drawing btw
---
Well done. Accept this PSI Cirrus for your hard fought victory!
---
That is weird 
---
I don’t get it.
---
Yeah idk I got a "mark of the fire" if that helps. Honestly it's not important or anything I've just never seen it before
---
What can I say except Young Wolf?
---
Hi yes do you take commissions and are they open and how do I request one thx
---
For me it’s worse in Rumble
---
I love it. I hate getting stomped by an oem user but it is only borderline op. This subtle nerf will bring it down to a reasonable place as opposed to outright destroying it. That's all it needs, to be dialed back from a 10 to an 8.
---
I don't care about Titan skating though and I've never been able to figure out how to do it. If I could, I'd probably just use it on stupid long hallways like in the forest.
---
We all know that factions aren't coming back...
---
I got the Malfeasance quest going but idk if I want to even touch Gambit a while so I'll put it on the back burner. Good luck though!
---
I guess just wait til the new season
---
Yeah, sounds about right
---
I've barely touched EP, want to thought, but yeah this was alot harder than the Strike weapon for sure
---
I would like to think that if they were not intending on incorporating the Factions back into our daily play that they would just delete my tokens already
---
....kinda like how they deleted all 1k of my Ikora tokens when Forsaken dropped. I was going to cash them in during the new season for chances at possible new loot...but nope they totally screwed that option for me by removing all functions from Ikora besides claiming a powerful after completing 20 bounties. The feels man, I didn’t even get a full set of the year 1 armor off her. 
---
Hope you enjoy story missions haha
---
Smart, I'll look into doing that!
---
Sliding shouldn't proc flawless execution imo. And decrease the damage resistance during spectral just a touch. That would go a long way
---
Yeah, not the best looking but plays well. I guess the better of the two options. 
---
I thought that too when I started today with 11 left. You can do it!
---
I'll pass haha I do want a seal but idk if that's the one for me
---
Cool
---
Skull? You get your super back... By using your super. Cant get any easier than that
---
Smart, I'll check into doing that! I enjoy Forge alot so it's not too hard to get one I think
---
Beautiful...... just beautiful 😭. The Lat Wish raid set is my favorite raid set
---
Then get that gun!!!
---
Um dude thats how any smart person approaches a 2v1. You deal w one while trying to cut off line of sight to the other as best you can then deal w the other. W oem all you have to do is get the kill on one guy, which really isnt hard even w primaries, it literally takes a second. You then are fully reset and w added buffs to take on the second. Removes all skill from 2v1.
---
Last*
---
I got the rare bounty for BA the other day, sadly I'm going out of town soon so I might miss the chance
---
This also struck me while I was finishing Forsaken on my 3rd about a week ago. 
---
This looks great! Please update when finished. 
---
Full auto frames or full auto rolls as well?
---
I'd imagine, might have made it easier but still 40 matches is 40 matches
---
I'm stuck on that too, a bit difficult
---
all the solo warlocks all the solo warlocks
---
In a 2v1 they shouldn't be winning against 2 people shooting at them unless they are good at the game and have mastered the movement of the titan. That nerf does nothing for the second person unless they have bad aim as the titan should have died anyway. I can guarantee that people will still complain about Mask because they had an overshield from a guy they killed in a 1v1.
---
Good baiting
---
The fucking ghost shell dude. Ugh.
---
Am I the only person who doesn't like Kindled Orchid and would have dismantled that in 0.0002 seconds for the shader or no
---
Why not? That’s technically a crouch, and it does take some skill to dome people while sliding
---
You said "no skill titans" so I responded based off a low to mid skill titan vs 2 average to slighlty above average players.
---
Lol whatever 
---
Exactly. 2 average to slightly above average players would dominate a single low to mid skill shotgun ape with or without Mask. Health and overshield after a kill on a specific person isn't saving an idiot. 
---
Thanks ....and I need the luck...
---
It doesn’t change anything difficulty-wise, does it? I’ve done a few sub 30 runs but i don’t think I’ve done any where no one died
---
Absolutely amazing stuff. Keep up the good work, this must have taken a while. 
---
for your invader kills, play the b1tch and use Queensbreaker, I tried to be nice guy buy I was getting insta-melted before I joined in and retaliated that person over and over again.
---
as for motes, any little bit helps.. don't collect.. I'd actually banked whatever I could grab so If I got killed I wasn't impacted as bad. 
---
Just wait for the Corruption quest, it's hard, I had given up but I got invited to help someone and then I realized well shit... I needed that. 
---
There are many different guns considered best. This is not a very min-maxer friendly game, so I don't think there is any one gun regarded as better than others. 
---
Some alternatives to Midnight Coup are Warden's Law or Duke MK.44 (both must have either feeding frenzy or outlaw to compete), or Better Devils. In general, most people prefer outlaw with either kill clip or rampage. Not just for hand cannons, but for almost every type of weapon. 
---
There aren't very many kinetic sniper rifles capable of having random perks. I think Long Shadow, Dreaded Venture, and Supremacy are the only ones. The perks you want to look for are totally different for pvp versus pve. Alone as a God has fixed rolls, but is still very good, similar to Midnight Coup. 
---
I'm on the corrupted quest now... 
---
No, that's not what is happening. This sounds like the phrase at the end of a game of telephone. 
---
This was in a This Week at Bungie post from several weeks ago. What is happening is that the Redrix Broadsword quest **only** now counts your entire time playing the game when you reach the step asking you to get 5 valor rank resets. Nothing else is affected by this change. 
---
It's mostly thunderlord and hammerhead anyway.
---
I agree that Xol should be portrayed as weaker than Oryx. This makes me inclined to agree that a strike should have been Xol's final encounter. I do not think that the Whisper was the best story-telling it continues the 'Weapons of Sorrow' track laid out by Oryx and tied in again with the most recent Last Word quest line and thus serves a purpose.
---
Orpheus Rig is probably the best super restoring exotics in the game
---
Heyo, hopefully this can hold you guys off until I can finish the nova bomb video I have in the works. Sorry it's so damn short, the song I used and liked was never completed by the soundcloud d00d. 
---
Did you ever find a fix for this? I just got the game, and anything that triggers a normal vibration kinds of turns it up to 11 and rumbles for no apparent reason for a little while before it stops. Shooting feels normal, until it clearly does not.
---
Guardian: uh?\*Punch\*  
---
**Dreg die**
---
Feels bad man feels bad
---
Woooo woooo.... wtf is that?
---
Me on iron banner last night. Except I died more. Still had a 6 streak though
---
Either you have awful aim and literally aren't landing a single bullet on an opposing Guardian, OR you accidentally wandered into Iron Banner. 
---
Quick question; do you lose the BN bounty next season?
---
The wording is kind of ambiguous, so instead of just jumping to conclusions, why don’t we wait till after the update and see what’s what?
---
Same model. It's blue shift. Prepare to see it again in Joker's wild when you level up.
---
You bought it for the origin story right?
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 13.
---
Our ghost: wait, that’s illegal 
---
What’s up with RNGesus? It seems that he is giving out some good loot. I got two exotics in one forge round yesterday.
---
Yeah, probably wouldn't have even thought about it if there wasn't one.
---
It was my absolute favourite year 1 gun. Had 20,000 kills with it 
---
So how much you pay ;) just messing mate well played and show that bad boy off 
---
It is
---
Definitely my favorite gambit envoy and blocker clearer. It's also nice to have the elements at your disposal.
---
Faster but riskier 
---
I am a below average PVP player. .7ish KD average. If I can manage ti get this quest done, anyone should be able to.  Play a little more conservative than you would normally. Scout rifles are your friend. Watch where your team mates are going.  Watch your radar. Be aware of your surroundings.   Sounds like the typical advice for general PVP, and it should!  I realize now that I play wahoo to aggressively and should be more aware of things.  Use the time left with Iron Banner to your advantage and get those kills Guardians!!!!   You got this!  
---
Haha. 
---
Wow. Gratz Brother!
---
Okay thanks, now I know I need to grind my soul out for the final reset
---
This is beautiful! Would you consider doing commissions?
---
Now do Malfeasance. There is no rest, only more guns.
---
I see, but what is it ? Is it like selling service or charging for no appropriate reason ?
---
The ammo bait was actually accidental, I didn't pick it up because I knew they'd respawn too fast. But I still fully expected them to capture in a group again.
---
Preach 🤗
---
If you have base D2, purchasing the Forsaken bundle gives you the two prior dlcs as well, so that's a start. Light and leveling is the same as D1 Taken King onwards system
---
Yup, that's the one.
---
Eh you can solo stack comp all the way to luna... but its def not a good idea.
---
Take advantage of it and get the triumph for getting 15 motes in like 2 seconds lmao 
---
Simple geometry 
---
1. Jump through "x" orb
---
2. Kill everything except projections 
---
3. Profit
---
I have no one to do the raid which sucks
---
Titan main here, Went through all of Crimson days and did my IB grind with Skullfort. I dont like OEM, Besides they cant get marked if I punch them first...
---
Boy you right, but man do people not understand that.
---
Where is this image come from ?
---
Imagine doing a raid flawlessly, just to get an error code at the end!?!?
---
Ima firin ma laza!!!
---
Not really if you can't win fights what u can focus on in Iron Banner is just straight up not dying, also capping points and such and joining in on team fights rather then 1v1s
---
No he legit means 0,7 kd
---
HOW DO I IMPORT THE SHADER INTO DESTINY
---
I bought it and took a pic and sent it to bunjie yet they said they can’t go that
---
SO HOW DO I GET IT IN
---
Lmao
---
Well except the taken goblin..... if you send 2 over they can just immune each other.
---
So you only had 1 exotic drop?
---
Light level advantages are removed in regular crucible. The equipment perks is the advantage for higher level
---
Not sure on the editions. You will want whatever includes the game and all the expansions including foresaken.
---
I wouldn't worry about the annual pass at this point. You won't be able to play the annual pass content until you are well over 600 light and completed most everything else.
---
It would be interesting if someone who has that amount of money tried to buy one, would it actually work?
---
I know, the level is more important than light level, its a skill thing, not a power thing
---
Or 2 exotic armour? As in 3 since that one counts as an exotic? I can imagine how painful it could be to see pre nerf wormhusk + sixth coyote or Frostees.
---
Don’t even start on the super...
---
This is for future reference, guardians:
---
If you're going to do the Gofannon or Bergusian forges, bring Riskrunner.
---
This little devil makes those two forges basically soloable, due to its perks.
---
There is a lot of fallen in those forges, which means tons of arc damage, and in the Bergusian forge, the captains in round 2 also have arc shields, so it's even better.
---
Good luck! 
---
Bungie please
---
Cheers
---
PvP Titans gonna be crying for weeks though
---
LOL
---
Yes Aeon Soul. What a rush.
---
That's a god roll , congrats!
---
I just got Shards of Galanor from the Queenbreaker servitor in trostland 
---
Here’s the annoying thing I love destiny 2 I got 2 exotic sparrows I’ve completed the dlc but I can’t play it cause I don’t have enough room for it and my brother won’t let me play it 😭😭😭 and I’m getting a PS4 but data won’t transfer 😭😭😭
---
Love hate for sure. I’m going to quit and go play anthem!......ummmm destiny....I didn’t mean it, still on for Friday? 
---
Comp, Raid &amp; NF are pretty much the only things i can't/wouldn't do Solo, but i got a clan for that. But yeah, D2 is primarily designed as a game to played with others.
---
im not a pvp player but lunas intrigued me enough to jump into it, id say its way more fun(and easier) with a team. but i did the first few part of the quest solo. its honestly worth it imo even to just keep as a trophy.
---
THERE IS NO RESPITE 
---
Is it double infamy right now? And triple next week?
---
It's normal right now, triple next week. 
---
Ophidian aspect??? Transversive steps?
---
Yeah, I’m still confused 
---
well no, Skullfort is not a problem, what IS a problem is that second kill you got. IT makes no sense that you should be able to 180 shouldercharge like that outta nowhere. Thats the issue, not skullfort 
---
Still no super black
---
Good grief when onslaught hits!!
---
Yeah, they'll have to find each other in matchmaking but then every game after that if they stay in the lobby they can presumably just keep going
---
I got it for 10€, played through the storyline in few days and realized, that cap is lvl 20 and all those max lvl nolifing nerds were annihilating me in PvP.
---
  
---
Ain't coming back, it's just as bad as the latest WoW expansion. Would literally play Borderlands all over again.
---
Havent played since November and not felt the urge too. Just nothing there to pull me back.
---
Is this in Russian?
---
Blade barrage got a decent hit though, especially how it syncs up with the shards of galanor. It used to be broken, now it's good.
---
I really like nova bomb. I wish I could have nova bomb with handheld supernova and contraverse, that would be great!
---
That's awesome! I really do enjoy Rumble even when I get trounced. 
---
They are referring to that kind of things: https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/aqddr7/the_vex_are_masters_of_the_simulation/ 
---
It doesn't happen often. But it could screw your round of gambit probably.
---
*It’s a sign*
---
Damn, I would be honored to see something like that. I have been playing since launch and have NEVER seen goblins trade like that.
---
Enjoy mate love the gun
---
Is it hard to do 
---
The quest
---
It may be a stupid question but why the pink color?
---
I didn’t think so tbh but I have logged about 900 hours on destiny to which is probably not the slot in comparison to many people here but I found it quite easy!
---
Through fire and flood
---
I find both games quite good, but I would say Destiny 2 would be the better choice for now. Destiny 2 has a lot of content and is in a pretty good state for PvE and not too bad for PvP at the moment. Anthem has a bit of lack in content and does need some fixes here and there due to how early it is in it's life. 
---
Hope this helps.
---
Oh cool , I'll try that later 
---
at first, sure... but that’s to be expected and in no time it will be as familiar any well trod path
---
Truth so much truth it hurts 
---
The fact that his dust rock is red and not orange is bothersome.

honestly, completing the ace of spades quest and the last word quest actually made me better at crucible. they try to teach you how to play (indirectly). if you keep playing, you'll get better.
---
100% true I’ve deleted this game 4 times and I still come back. 
---
I want the ability to build a camp in Destiny 3
---
Just read the patch notes 
---
RIP OeM 
---
The only thing that's worse is probably when you see a blueberry with 15 motes during an invasion, running for the bank, only to run past it on his way to the next hostile waypoint with every other blueberry shooting at them to try and get their attention while screaming at them to bank those motes.
---
Thanks, I hate it. 
---
r/TIHI
---
Yep I know this pain ... 
---
You have to defeat an eyeball boss in gambit and u have a chance of getting it
---
I’m on pc
---
Congrats, in two weeks it'll be raised again (assumably to 700), so enjoy your brief reprieve.
---
Thx tho
---
Super ornaments when? 
---
Ah never mind bro good luck
---
I can’t kill anything with a shotgun in PvP and only the Ace or one specific Y1 hand cannon work for me.
---
PvP is usually a pulse (Black Armory prototype or the Prophcy one). And Jade Rabbit scout.
---
Sometimes switch to Breakneck and Polaris Lance I love scout rifles and do well PL and JR can double or triple tap and from 1/2 way across the map
---
Cammy is that you?
---
Some good pve subclass neutral options are Karnstein armlets, verity's brow, and chromatic fire. Some good pvp subclass neutral exotics are transversive steps and ophidian aspects. 
---
Never stop using your gift. You will become huge if you bust your ass off. 
---
Who? 
---
Feel free to join my clan. There's only two or three of us though lol. We don't play every single day, but get on enough to do bounties and what not. We're a small clan with adults, which is why it's hard for us to get on everyday. If you're interested let me know and I'll send you an invite. 
---
When you are about to use the character boost, it warns you that doing so means you cannot complete the first three campaigns or collect their quest rewards. 
---
Lemme get uhhhh more copper and purple shaders
---
Yeah like last 3 days
---
*bang* *bang *bang* FBI OPEN UP!
---
This lines up with what I have said to people complaining about the pinnicl weapons giving an edge letting too PvP players wreck in quick play.
---
That player slaughtering you with LW NF LH well yeah they are really good at the game and got the guns.... they would STILL slaughter you if they didn’t have them and you did.
---
People are confusing good player with gun and got killed by gun the gun acts as a warning the player is good engage with that info but take it away and they could still wipe you out with a Y1 handcannon 
---
REEEEEEEEEE
---
Dude get a job 30 dollars is nothing 
---
Eris Morn’s sunsetting shader, Chatterwhite, and Glowhoo would all say otherwise... 
---
I actually meant to have more explanation in that post, sorry about that. The reason I've done it thrice now is that when I start a new character I grab the quest anyways and just let it complete itself just through play. I'm not 'grinding' for it, I'm just playing Gambit. Actually this time around I finished the 40 matches before I finished the kills.
---
Awesome. I love how you could tell they all saw that coming and were like “oh sh*t panic jump, nova bomb coming!”
---
Warlocks are walking, talking, living Coldhearts... neat
---
the one on the left is my curated roll that i got a few weeks ago, one on the right just dropped along with the le monarque
---
Those triumphs!
---
Except they stay when you spawn back in
---
It’s definitely best in pve and basically just shoot one in the head and once you have the lightning rod, shoot an uncharged shot at the ground by a big group. If you shoot it uncharged, each arrow will start it’s own lighting chain
---
I can *hear* this fucking image. Take your upvote.
---
My 0.02:  awesome weapons for clearing mid-short range adds.  Of course , it shines when rampage kicks in.    
---
However , momentum with this weapon gets broken a lot on reloads (i’d argue on backup magasine here) and you must constantly remind yourself of hitting reload after mini packs of NPCs
---
I’ve been absolutely shredded  when I try to use this weapon on specific areas  like Shattered Throne or even Whisper dungeon, that it made me even question my ability to play end game content lol.   I mean try to shoot Taken from away to basically get murdered from shots coming at all angles.   What are you guys using , Pulse Rifles ??? 
---
Oh for sure! Still have to self Rez and run by powerful centurions to get it. (Leviathan)
---
It’s garbage, I was using it for headshots for the forge
---
Ayyy I have the Dell G5 too! It runs destiny so well and there was a sick deal during Black Friday. Loving it so far
---
Petition for celestial nighthawk to turn BB into one giant fucking sword
---
Sometimes keeping them from killing the envoys when they first spawn the primeval can also be detrimental cause, after all, you don't want them melting the primeval after accumulating Primeval Slayer from killing the envoys. 
---
He actually outlines everything he did wrong when he loses a fight. That's one of the reasons I like him so much
---
Ugh, I figured out this out for me, maybe you're having the same problem. It was my fault technically but also stupid as all hell. After you beat the game you have a milestone to go back to the tower and speak to Hawthorne. I did that and nothing happened because you have to pick up an item from here as well. Once you talk to her and select the item you'll get a quest to talk to someone else. Rinse, repeat. You talk to like five people and get items from all of them, the last one being Zavala. Then you'll get access to the expansions.
---
tnx for long explanation im on PC master race tho ;(
---
Rifled is next best. It’s what i’ve got on mine because i’m still trying to find that god roll. Full Choke tightens the spread and takes away crit damage but with rifled the spread stays the same but you can crit so it can OHK from farther but full choke is more consistent with the far OHK
---
Thanks
---
The games are very different, honestly it’s going to be between anthem and division 2 to be my in between destiny content games.
---
Yeah you want to invade as much as possible as starting when they summon it since the portal keeps coming back every 30 seconds. Anyone who's faced an invader that does this knows how much harder it makes killing the primeval 
---
our opinion
---
nice :)
---
Fair enough. 
---
It is..
---
Hey, how did you get a warlock next to your name :(
---
I guess the only thing I don't understand is how Osiris was still able to use the Light without Sagira after she was captured by the Vex since ghosts by our understanding hold all of our light. I guess he's an exception anyway since he's legendary and supposedly under constant "radiance" with his solar abilities.
---
Yea I got to end game and geared up 3 jav's but it's so barren :/
---
(46hrs played)
---
Flair, search for it, don't remember procedure 
---
Yeah like I said you can get the cutscene but that’s where it cuts you off unfortunately :/
---
exactly what i was thinking haha 
---
Oh really? Gonna try it out!
---
Thanks friend 
---
PAN SHOT
---
It's an overshield with OEM.
---
I figure the idea of supers says that Guardians stockpile power constantly. And Osiris had enough to work in the forest while Sagira was getting you.
---
Saying he was outskilled *does* mean he admitted defeat. It’s possible to not make a mistake and still get out played. 
---
Thanks for the support!
---
this looks good maybe i’ll come back to d3 if they dont fuck it up again 
---
It’s $30 for a years worth of content. Obviously there will be downtime but there was something new literally every week in Black Armory, if you include Crimson Days from last week and Iron Banner for this week.
---
He didnt quit,hes moving or shooting intermittently to avoid getting kicked.  The idiots at bungie thought it was a good idea to make a quest that requires completing 40 gambit matches to finish and here we are.
---
I want this now
---
The guns are a reward so it's okay. But I've never reached Brave in my life. So what is the crucible team smoking to pair me with a full team of Luna's? Bungie has loads of years of experience with fps multiplayer. So why is the matchmaking equivalent to Haiti's redevelopment process?
---
Fellow sunrise warrior checking in o7
---
Yeah that's the next thing on my list. I'm hoping it won't be as demanding.
---
He was pointing out the spelling mistake
---
Why would someone stream that? 
---
guy on left is a little off tho
---
Ppl know they can shot at tether, right....
---
Don't ask me bro I'm as confused as you.
---
*pre-nerf blade barrage*
---
*Spectral blade*
---
And missing the chance to obliterate a team of kids. 
---
Hmmmm.
---
Except instant respawn and only 6 players. Rumble is fine.
---
I was doing the ascendent challenge with my friend. I died but the portal to enter disappeared. My friend got the bounty but not me 
---
Yeah I was just too much of a coward and I paid for it
---
My apologies I should’ve had an earrape warning
---
"I'm not gonna play his game, he plays mine."
---
I repeat this to myself now too.
---
I could go with Nova Bomb, Chaos Accelerant, Dark Matter, Entropic Pull, and Slova Bomb.
---
I could either wear Dire Skull or Nezarec's Sin since Dark Matter works with Nez's perk. Getting a kill with entropic pull might almost fully recharge my grenade.
---
Do you think Transcendence would work with Chaos Reach???
---
What about Taken Phlanaxes and them knocking u across the map
---
Wardcliff is essentially 2 guaranteed kills, more if you're lucky. The other ones require some degree of skill to actually get kills with, Wardcliff you look at someone and shoot.
---
When you forget to leave the 6 stack que that just ended you 
---
Right? I just hit 53000 t-score... I’m pretty proud but not pompous enough to post
---
лол
---
Try slowva bomb since the update 
---
You got this! Then the hatred can subside 
---
He's even killing you in PVE no one's safe 
---
It's not hatred. It's just envy
---
Stop flexing on me with 10000 legendary shards
---
You're not wrong...

Mate I know how it works. I complained about how it doesn't work because I know how it works. Then you tell me it not skill based. Then I say yeah i wish it had some basic matchmaking. Then you say the same thing. Why are you here?
---
Oh god season of the drifter exists oh no please i dont want to go back into that shitshow
---
I cant even find a sherpa for scourge. It looks so easy but I dont want to be the guy jumping in a group not wanting to teach and cant find a sherpa.
---
Boom! Roasted.
---
What how
---
Iirc the season pass runs right up until around December with another Solstice of Heroes. They'll all probably be smaller updates, with new weapons/armor like Black Armory. There's a likelihood that we won't get a fourth dlc, I'm certain that we only got RoI because they needed more time to finish D2.
---
To be fair, this is a joke. I don’t care what people use. I just thought it was funny.
---
Duh

Sorry, your submission has been automatically removed.

It appears you are asking a question about LFG/Clans, or help in-game. 
---
Please post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/89vbwr/official_lfg_megathread_version_20/?sort=new) instead, look at the LFG dropdown menu on the top bar of the subreddit for various LFG tools, or check the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/8ji06r/official_faq_please_read_before_posting/) for possibly helpful advice on how to find people to play with our advertise/find clans.

Waste of time. They won’t add this because they didn’t think of it first. Bungie is much more likely to take something that is well received by the players and make an unnecessary change that ultimately annoys the players
---
1000 times this!!! Yes!!!
---
Nois, that inspired me and did a forge, Got kill clip+ rampage. 
---
The people downvoting this are Bungie employees
---
Doesn't matter brother were all one in the same. We're all guardians we need to stand strong together
---
He thinks snipers dont take skill? What?
---
I honestly was not expecting that many people there. I thought I'd find 3 at most lol.
---
Destiny is a destiny killer
---
Glückwunsch diggi 🙌
---
Go after the forge saboteurs 
---
Jokes on all of you, I make it a point to stop before I hit max light and don't play til the next expansion
---
Bungie has perfected the art of making players stop and look up.  I will always remember tracing the first halo in the sky, watching it rush into view underneath your feet.
---
any tips for those who grinding for exotics ? where did you drop most of your exotics ? 
---
Daaaang! Grats man! 
---
I’ve sharded so many and I believe snapshot/rampage is the best I’ve gotten. Can’t remember the masterwork.
---
Nice idea. But I don't think that nightstalkers would exist as we have turned to a darker path
---
Nup, he was clean. Vanilla base game.
---
It wishes.
---
Nah he's a wizzard. Least that's what he keeps telling us
---
Do you play on console?
---
Also same for gambit. Had games this week I couldn’t get out of in orbit. I blame console mod times. Seems to take a few seconds for the dismiss interface to come up and by that time the game is confirmed and launches. 
---
Wait what? I think its time you leave this post as all you're doing now is giving me a good laugh about your idiocy.
---
With fortnight and Apex Legends, I think Destiny needs to improve their game and especially make quick updates. 
---
It can't kill Destiny if it kills itself with its garbage end game and bland story, flying is fun but too many enemies have fire abilies and force you to fight on the ground, it's a joke of a game
---
XD why is titan titan , warlock warlock but hunter is jäger
---
I got the Queenbreaker and lots more from PvP and gambit do good luck
---
Best idea ever. 
---
I still dont really see the point in being able to go invis if people can still see you in PvP and enemies still spam fire wherever you last we're before you go invis(half the time resulting in you dying if you're going invis to try and get out of a risky situation) in pve. The only time I've ever used it is for resing a teammate

To recap the numerous explanations in the comments, CammyCakes is:
---
Destiny 2 YouTuber
---
God
---
A Wizard
---
And never gets mad
---
Unless you count that video a while back where he just gets super triggered by a teabagger. 
---
This happened to me but didn’t know what it meant...
---
Nah... he still kept his cool there
---
ive posted in the crucible forums on here a few times just to have my opinion get shut down and called an idiot..
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
when you guys talk about cammy you praise him like hes the best 
---
kina ironic that ive played him and beat him in rumble a few times... winning most engagements against him
---
but remember im trash low skill, idiot that doesn't understand the game... but ive literally shit on the man you praise multiple times
---
guess when your not main stream and have a higher level opinion on something about game balance youre just considered an idiot because someone of a lesser skill doesn't agree with you..
---
I literally just got all the proof I need from the dick riding... tells me I know more than the majority does 
---
I didn’t know it was a PS4 exclusive but thanks! 
---
Does Monday sound all right?
---
use core terminus at anna, you can sparrow through the sector all the way to the boss. he takes 3\~ heavy sword strikes to kill, drops 10 and a shortcut door opens when the rooms clear. takes all of 2 mins to do.
---
Nah. If you think you can hide your absence of arguments behind joke and leave, u probably should find another thread. 
---
I don’t mind going up against a 4 stack in comp when soloing. It makes it a more intense game and makes beating them more satisfying if a team of randoms beat a co-ordinated 4 stack. I’d rather have an intense game than an easy win honestly.
