They might as well not be guardians at that point. It could easily be the humans of the farm. They're still out there, after all, trying to reclaim the edz. Look at Devon.

---
---
How
---
Can confirm, i cant buy any forsaken guns because im a new light newb.
---
Honestly dude I don't even know
---
We did have control in comp, It was shit. Just wait a little bit Elimination will replace survival once they finish testing it
---
Yea I was going the guardian route because they would still have exotics
---
its because its free
---
They’ve said it’s something they’d definitely like to do and may look into, but it’s not something coming any time soon if at all during Destiny 2’s life

Tbh, I don’t see many mountaintops on pc in crucible. Personally I use it because I like grenade launchers and can hit direct hits reliably, the mobility and aim differences 100% makes a huge impact though. If you can’t land direct hits it’s ok at best.
---
Isn't that one of the Jade Rabbits where you present a Rice Cake to them? Or the room where you can view all your collected Rabbits?
---
the nerfs didnt do too much tbh, the only thing that really changed was the healing on kills when the real problem was the duration of the super being as long as approximately 47 days
---

---
they nerfed the duration by 2% and took away healing from all supers, consequently nerfing an already bad super, arcstrider
---
Nothing surprises me about that damn thing.
---
Even outside momentum it’s very strong though
---
Someone's mad lol
---
Yes!
---
hackers
---
Thanks man
---
Im on Xbox thats  the thing
---
Oh then yeah definitely
---
You're just very lucky
---
I was about the same when it happened to me. It's been a very nice way to close the gap on my friends given I've only been playing, not even 2 weeks in.
---
Its a good perk I guess for doing some Halloween grind.

I usually can't get a good piece of legendary gear to drop xD I'm not that lucky. RNG Jesus hates me

Rest In Spaget

I don't record my gameplay. Don't be an ignoramus that thinks it's an unhackable game though. If it's on the internet at any capacity, it can be hacked. Full stop, don't even come at me with that shit. I've had 12 private messages about how this game can be hacked and its bull shit and that didn't happen. Mother fuckers it fucking did what god damn point do I have to lie? Get the fuck over yourselves.
---
new player here,
---
I find that I am gaining power and moving across new worlds pretty quickly, before I complete everything on the planet.
---
I'm sitting close to 900.
---
is there a point of going back to old worlds? Will I still get good gear? Asking as I don't think I've done all the adventures yet
---
Get the “where is Xur? “ app on ur phone. Shows u where he is on the map and tells u what he’s selling. Drops are on Friday
---
Well you generally get 3 shots in a very short period, vs OHK AOE that lasts a ridiculous amount of time.
---
Don’t worry I suck with it.
---
Imagine your health bar was fully gone but like you were still alive
---
Catalysts are always the same andni would asume so for curated roles
---
Skinny fucker
---
Hey do yourself a favor and don't be the blueberry that uses this gun AND another primary. This gun does the same damage as an SMG that shoots twice as fast. Awful.
---
If I had to assume, you completed your weekly bounty for them and got Lucky with an exotic
---
Oh ok thank you
---
It was the heroic this week. Thank you for the kind words.

Lol I posted something similiar but got negative downvotes. Guess that's reddit roulette for ya :P
---
Anytime lol. So what were you trying to say before the stroke lol?
---
Momentum Control? you mean Jade Rabbit the gamemode?
---
I would just camp heavy in comp then wait until there’s 2 or 3 enemies close to eachother and spam all my colony shots at them
---
The description is bugged

You're actually supposed to complete 3 strikes using the same subclass as the elemental burn

I have been trying this and while kills are easy staying alive is not because I constantly get sniped by scout rifles the entire game. 
---
I am doing okay except for the group kills which I barely ever see people grouped up.
---
Steady rounds on PC and the Dad Furnace makes it far better. Plus that is an insane roll. Bottom hands down.
---
I dare you not to sell Nezarec's Sin for at least 5 resets.
---
Your exotics, hand em over.
---
Yeah.. I got the 30 min to 3 hours number from the beginners guide (pinned on this sub)
---
The guide states that the first run (meaning the ones who figured it out without a guide) took 5 hours and a half, beginners take 1 to 2 hours (with someone to explain) and experienced players take 30 mins.
---
I'm a returning player and i honestly feel bad for everyone that grinded the mountaintop when it first released
---
So frost is better over all?
---
Sadly most people dont use a headset either. Sounding is way more accurate than radar.
---
This is why you don't teabag
---
Doesnt necessarily make you good, but it makes you insane, which is close enough.

You guys replied my comment missing  reward becouse did reset before took quest.  Sorry if missed something

Sorry

I have the "Encrypted key". I've completed wave 6-7 now three times but it never became decrypted. Do I need to support the full sequential 1-7 waves to decrypt? Or a set number of completed waves? Or non-sequential 1-7? Can I join in on another wave 6/7 and complete?
---
Btw, is Drifter a titan or warlock?
---
205 IQ play
---
I understand why you’re upset but it’s also an issue of finding who actually had the bounty and didn’t. I also got scammed out of my bounty btw so I’m not looking down on you
---
OEM is a pathway to many abilities, some considered to be unnatural.
---
Man been grinding strikes all weeks I need the fighting lion. So I can have that sweet ammo and grind for mount top..
---
I would argue that my post is more a coming back to destiny as a result of changes. The loot is a byproduct, imho
---
Warlock I believe but don't quote me on it

&gt;Warlock I believe but don't quote me on it

 You have been quoted on this post.
---
You deserve that because you’re a spectral. Nah but that’s a big oof
---
I can't wait for the day some gets a rare, legendary, prime, AND exotic engram.
---
I can't believe you've done this
---
I made this joke today with my friend before I even saw this bruh fricking boomers
---
Add me on PSN: MonkeyD_Swadley. I'm usually on at night after 5 pm CST. I have it and can help with it or just about anything else
---
You can get it form any chest in the raid, it’s all random. My RNJesus bless you.
---
All good, just give both a rock and see which you prefer!
---
I'm sorry but is this supposed to be a feat? You r supposed to do like 5 of them per week to get good food
---
It's obviously because Cayde-6 was afraid of 7
---
If you’re on pc, you can join the pc lfg discord and find ppl there. There is a Sherpa lfg channel specifically for guardians like yourself looking to learn new raids. That’s how I learned the raids so I highly recommend using it.
---
thx. May RNJesus bless us all with the things we need
---
VOID TITANS UNITE!

Certain pieces of armor may be worth keeping because they may have perks on them that you can’t quite get yet. See, Y3 armor can be customized but you have to unlock the perks you’ll probably want. I for one had continued to use the armor set I’d built up in Y2 because it had mostly enhanced rolls on it for my hand cannons, and that was a build I was used to, so I didn’t scrap it yet since I couldn’t get those perks. So if it has perks you like and cannot put on your new armor yet, then you should keep it for now.
---
As for exotic weapons, there hasn’t been a single weapon ever removed from the game so the weapons remain pretty much the same. You’ll find, however, that there are many legendary weapons that change the game more completely than most exotics. But to answer your question, yes, the weapons are pretty much the same with a few adjustments, such as hand cannon range nerf and scout rifle buffs.
---
thanks for all the quick answers!
---
Emote
---
he’s just vibing bro leave him be
---
bro 😎💪
---
Kill Zavala. Push him off and down into the City
---
But why would he be scared of 7?
---
That's a shame.
---
They did not the last fix broke another step and the next step fix isThursday which means like I said we still can’t get it.
---
She's not small actually. Her feet's in the ground. Realized that when i saw how small she was when i grabbed my Jotunn

PvP be like that.

If you need the Recluse (PvP Smg) you can get it, but I would recommend using something like the Huckleberry Exotic Smg or a well rolled Vex Offensive Smg.  Still good and zero of the suffering that is Competitive Crucible.
---
No you right he’ll claw the crap out of your face
---
Same, never even tried it
---
Thanks, but I gave up on PC since controllers for console are typically more durable than keyboard and mouse. Also why I gave up on gambit.
---
Your will is not your own
---
B E S T G I R L
---
Oh damn. If we played on the same console, id help you, but I play on Xbox. I soloed it cuz my teammates just up and left me and the game didn't give me anyone. Although, I do play a Titan though, so I wouldn't be able to give you tips on being a warlock. I'm sorry ):
---
I don’t want the cheats, but can you pm me the name? I kinda want to know what it looks like when Destiny is doing things it doesn’t like to do. I’ve seen it have a stroke while doing regular things (like me hanging myself with a wall in the tower) but idk how the game would handle things it wasn’t designed to handle.
---
It doesn’t?
---
Ace of Spades is my favorite by far. I've been running that and Outlast in Comp the last few days with massive success. Just got my recluse and revoker within a couple games of each other. About 1.3k more glory until 5500 and hopefully I'll be close for the rest of the pursuit for NF/LH
---
Doing better than me
---
I was able to complete the triumph over the last couple days (had completely given up on it previously), and you might want to try a special ammo grenade launcher if you haven't. I used an Orewing's Maul with proximity grenades (to make it explode with what would otherwise be near misses), volatile launch for greater blast radius, and threat detector for pseudo radar. It seemed a lot easier to get kills with it than the lion and kinda felt like it arced less. Though depending on your playstyle you may do better with the lion. Regardless, you have to avoid places where people can shoot you from a mile away, and it will help if you get the map awareness to know where people are likely to camp in a room. Counter intuitively, you must master the art of stealth and ambush to rack up grenade launcher kills, at least until you get fast enough to jump over people and  shoot them from above.
---
And I came to accept that I wasn't going to make any progress in Widow's Court and started just changing my loadout when that came up. The whole trying to avoid places where people can map you is impossible there because only 5% of the map is safe.
---
Shadowkeep?.. i only have warmind and curse of osiris dlc and season pass... does the update still apply to my game?
---
cool helmet too.  2,850 bright dust for the set?
---
2,000 silver, actually
---
Windows defender sometimes quarantines certain files. Without notifs.
---
Wow. You are probably unstoppable
---
All non quest guns and armor are obtainable without forsaken
---
Survival gives glory rank, all others give valor rank. When you hover over the dif game modes survival is the only red rank, others are orange
---
Sounds like a good reason to drop em. They’re exploiting you lol
---
Only for quest exotics
---
Hunters are cool and all, very fun to play as, but why stop playing Titan? We have the most powerful knees of ANY class, AND the heaviest armor. What more could you want?
---
Is it possible to earn moon armor if you didn't buy shadowkeep? I have access to the moon, I just want to know if the essences will drop or however it works.
---
Survival is also referred to as 'comp' for this reason
---
Didn’t xur sell it a week or so ago?
---
How do I get lord shaxx mask
---
Well a sniper is a good pairing, and loaded question or a shotgun with 1-2 punch would be good as well
---
When does the haunted forst end?
---
I see. Thank you :)
---
Thank you :)
---
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF ME! HA HA!
---
dude this is absolutely sick, I love it
---
What we really needed was a Cayde-6 mask for the event.....just saying.
---
I still get hate for just being a titan tho
---
Alternate title: the entire Ogre maze in Pit of Heresy.
---
I would. The gear is not the goal, it just helps.
---
So if I don’t laugh at a joke that gets commented like 100 times a day I’m salty? Something tells me you’ve made the joke a couple times and don’t like being called out lol
---
Edit: lmaooo I was right, you have made multiple “titan dumb” comments. Ironic.
---
I second this. Yeet the blue turtle-man.
---
What does that mean?
---
&gt;that

&gt;*(used to indicate a person, thing, idea, state, event, time, remark, etc., as pointed out or present, mentioned before, supposed to be understood, or by way of emphasis):*    e.g **That is her mother. After that we saw each other.**
---
I wholeheartedly agree ;;
---
Pinnacle weapons now don't have pinnacle perks.
---
So an exotic sidearm?
---
But can your chair do this! $399
---
Yoooo another nigga who plays destiny lets gooooo
---
Nothing beats your first. Now, on to last wish to get your first Riven one phase.
---
Would you guys be willing to help me through Prestige Leviathan? My clan does raids very often, but only new ones. I've never done prestige y1 raids but would like to.
---
I mean, the Cabal took it for quite a while.
---
Not with the exotics that multiply their melee damage theyre not. I can solo an Overlord by literally just punching it and using a one2 punch shotty
---
Xurly, you can't be serious.
---
I put that on my hunter lol, I don’t have the vex cloak yet so using a mask gives me the effect of not having the hood on and shaxx’s mask is the closest to a normal helmet.
---
What does thunder mean?
---
I'm very interested in knowing how one manages to run two exotic gauntlets at once.
---
I've never done prestige Leviathan, but I'm able to equip/transfer the gun to my alt characters that never did the raid.
---
Thanks
---
Wait what? Im not versed in halo lore, but I need answers
---
I just went and checked my shaders collection page.  It looks like the majority of shaders cost 500 glimmer and 2 legendary shards each, so coloring four pieces of armor would cost 2000 glimmer and 8 shards total.  I recall going to Rahool a few times, dismantling stacks of shaders, and getting maybe 500 glimmer and 1 legendary for each stack of 5.  I tried dismantling an individual shader, and got 100 glimmer.
---
I can understand practical items like weapons and armor needing more resources to recreate than you may have gotten out of them (three weapon parts and a few hundred glimmer for a new rare weapon, compared to the one weapon part you get for dismantling a rare).  But doing it for cosmetic items seems a tad silly.  (I do understand that the final price to color all armor I calculated above is pretty petty cash for an experienced player.)
---
(Also, I'm a hoarder.)
---
It’s not even about whether it’s funny or not, it’s just annoying at this point how many times it’s commented. It’d be like if your friend went around constantly saying the same joke to everyone, eventually it’s gonna get old and annoying
---
Their letting us know that they (unknown of who "they" might be) dragged Benedict to the underworld....and the broom is from the fight that ensued, between the forces of light and dark. They seen the guardian coming down the steps and froze, just to make us have a false sense of security. Be wary guardian....
---
I really need to quit thinking too deep about this stuff......
---
Relax, this is a change made in the October 1, 2019 patch. 
---
&gt;but I have the armor open but I can't start the first quest she gives
---
So you can talk to her, but not do any bounties? Are you sure she did not give you a machine gun frame? If not, have you done the New Light intro quest? The one with "new light" in its name.
---
Jade rabbit is stupidly good in momentum control everything else is pretty much second to it
---
nah we actually punch harder than Titan. And we regen. This comment is made by Hunter Gang.
---
Rahool: *sweats nervously*
---
Why does shame look like Spiderman
---
Not bending down to the meta. Respect up. 
---
Also I wonder how many of those titans just didn’t get OEM yet
---
Ah okay yeah when I started okay when this game became free my friends told me to do the quest dlcs I had before I got forsaken and I just beat it today
---
IIRC, they keep their memories, but there memory gets worse with every reboot
---
Due to various nations' laws, drop rates of loot boxes purchased for real money have to be published. [You can find these easily on the bungie website.](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/47066) However, it only shows drop rates for items of each rarity.
---
You're meming but this is basically the firebreak calculus
---
lucky lad
---
I'll take a Not Forgotten please :3
---
I guess your're right, they DID take over the entire earth in only 7 hours, and that was without the foot soldiers.
---
For the experience and do scourge of the past for the anarchy
---
Yeah, once you have purchased the Masterworked BRAYTECH werewolf which comes with a curated roll of Multikill Clip / Zen Moment, you are then able to purchase randonlynrolled versions of the gun.
---
You can see a list of possible rolls on sites like light.gg which has a database of weapons and their possible rolls.
---
I keep getting the same ones over and over and over myself lol
---
I was getting kicked everytime I tried to fly to the tangled shore. I restarted my PC and took the router off the power grid for a minute. That worked (at least for me)
---
Sorrow's Harbor. Kill the Nightmares (bosses and strongs) they will drop.
---
Just curious, what chest piece is that? I'm still struggling to find good looking armor for my warlock but yours looks great
---
But can't you still try getting better base rolls for worls vendor gear like returning tokens for Failsafe Nexus gear? Naturally you still have to infuse then to get better light, but still...
---
Lick my taint and call me jamaal this is ToXiC
---
Ahhhhhhhh now i want to delete this its to the side ;-;
---
Ok,so,i just checked. The thing on the left with blue glowing eyes is the Jade Rabbit which is why ''you lack something'' . The red cat tho,is the same as the ones from the Dreaming City,just a Nightmare Version of it. As far as i know,it's an Easter Egg.
---
Directions unclear. Crayons in my nose.
---
This ⬆️, 100% true. Completely forgot about the season pass attached to it. With that being said, if you definitely decide to stay with it, and are looking forward to the future content releases. Deluxe is the way to go.
---
The only way is to do powerful gear that's from completing crucible matches and strikes and stuff like bounties.
---
do whatever says powerful gear
---
Experience, armor, weapons, catalyst, exotics, and unique sparrows/ships/ghosts. 
---
Triumphs, seals, and achievements if you care about those too.
---
This year’s one didn’t require you to complete all of the triumphs listed for the title, but here’s a few examples of some you could complete:
---
- Complete certain raids
---
- Get pinnacle weapons
---
- Complete x amount of strikes
---
- Forge Black Armory stuff
---
- Fully upgrade menagerie chalice
---
- Get full set of season of the drifter armor
---
So you can probably expect having to complete objectives related to the core Vanguard/Gambit/Crucible playlists, collect a ritual weapon or two, and complete endgame activities like raids and dungeons. 
---
I’m not entirely how they’d handle objectives for new content, since the new season pass design is very different from the annual pass.
---
Its a really unbelivable long grind. I am at the 70 % Headshot Part... 
---
I hope when i get five Resets this Season and get to the Step with the five Resets in the Next Season - so Next Year - it still counts for the 'Quest'
---
Holy shit spanish shaxx is cool
---
&gt; Shrieker can literally be killed a minute into that e
---
oh the bosses were easy it was the fucking KNIGHTS THAT KEPT SPAWNING FOR SOME FUCKING REASON
---
that i had to keep pushing backwards
---
also the fact the towers spawned so fucking far away from each other....
---
I’m an OG Year 1 Destiny 1 player and RNGesus has hated me the entire time I’ve played. Sure I’ve got some drops, but it’s a pain in the ass to roll with randoms on strikes and see everybody get exotic drops and all I get are blues and the occasional legendary lol
---
This brings back the spawn toobing memories from modern warfare...gg
---
bruh nothing in the game even compares to my winters guile /s
---
Xol uses Ascendant Hive rules: find his throne world and kill him there to be rid of him for food.  And the Hive brood on Mars is run by the only necromancer Oryx's family ever had.  So Xol is getting reincorporated, and the Hive footsoldiers are getting rezzed.
---
Hawthorne starter gear?
---
Where is my loot??
---
Fun, armor with high stats, bragging rights, and the freedom of running it with almost any weapon and not being criticised for it.
---
Gear from a anywhere can have very high base stats, I'd recommend paying attention to "wasted" points. Like if something has a base of 65, but 15 of the points are in stats you don't use, it's basically just a 50.
---
For consistent high rolls, you already mentioned the raid which is a great place.
---
Another is the dungeon, it dropped a fully masterworked piece of gear for me. Pretty decent. 
---
Iron Banner is by far the best right now, I have quite a few pieces with 60+ base stats with very little waste.
---
Is that true? That would be stupid
---
I don't quite get what you are trying to do with the companion app?
---
You are trying to get people from your friend list to join you in game, right?
---
That poor man who lost 106 motes... a moment of silence
---
See I got a perfect pve roll, grave robber and 1 2 punch range masterwork. What did my dumbass do after playing late into the night? Dismantled it because I was just spamming F to get rid of blues.
---
I guess its a titan, just look at that intellect!
---
Imagine a good weapon type being meta
---
Does throwing hammers count?
---
It honestly doesn't happen very often. This season I saw one cheater in Survival, that's about it. It's funny content to post on YouTube and Reddit though.
---
Nothing will happen.
---
Too bad your one-two punch got nerfed :(
---
I just got peregrine greaves after that got nerfed
---
*contacting destiny servers ...*
---
The Leviathan is one ship. The Covenant have thousands, and most of them are capable of *literally* turning the surface of a planet to glass. So yes, comparatively their technology is some weak shit.
---
Got to branch 9 and watched this fucker take down 2 of my teammates. I slipped away just in time.
---
alright, thats cool, thanks
---
oh, thats good to hear, thanks
---
I have this theory where titan mains have 2 brain cells one for sprinting and the second for shoulder charging
---
Izanagis.
---
it's like having a gunslinger hunter with celestial nighthawk, but without the hassle of waiting for the super.
---
To quote Shaxx:
---
"What? WHAT?! HOW?!?"
---
You should get more aim assist, I do believe that is a mechanic. Which is bullshit. 
---
But your movement is also going to be terrible and your aim is going to be "sticky" which can hinder you greatly.
---
Xp and just to enjoy the story again. Plus its really fun being at like 950 light and just oneshotting everything.
---
keep it and trade in for upgrade modules at the gunsmith when the resources change.
---
Ok I'll try that thank's
---
Thanks for the spelling correction lol
---
You’ll probably need a full team for “protect the runner” because now they’ve changed the way round three works in gambit it’s a lot harder to get passively.
---
Its not an ordinary roll... you need 20 phasmatic pieces of crap to make one red ball to exchange for the essence of rage (describes me atm)
---
ive got that part done already, but thanks for the advice
---
Ikora didn't even need to finish the portal for them to invade.
---
I love how they crowded around you when you started dancing.
---
Oh your new to destiny arent you?
---
How is the community with helping new people through raids?
---
Oh and I would be playing on ps4 pro
---
Yeah, it is super easy to find people to play with. It is definitely worth it to jump into, especially now since the base game is free. So you should give it a try.
---
thank you kind sir
---
Indeed
---
1. The game has more players than ever!
---
2. The game is gonna be supported for at least another 2 years 
---
3. It’s really easy to find people on the destiny companion app’s lfg
---
So did anyone figure it out?
---
Shaxx just came
---
He's corner peeking.
---
I'm all for the event, but I can't help but think this is Destiny's "Beat the game on Legendary without dying to see Master Chief's face"
---
That’s puurty. Also happy cake day
---
It's a matter of time not skill.
---
I had an easy multikill with thundercrash once and instead of jumping like I used to I just used it from the ground, I flicked my mouse too hard and hit a pipe. Talk about embarrassment
---
When titans think that they are not overpowered enough
---
I still wonder why match making would not apply here as well, at strikes if someone leaves they get replaced.. copy paste that here and were done and happy ... for the most part..
---
Either those were the weapons they used or after they passed or whatever happened to them, shaxx created the weapons as a remembrance, either way the lore is so in-depth and I’ve been wanting to start reading into it. I think this post has really shown me the greatness of the lore, how do you read it? Is there a website or do you use the in game lore pages?
---
I have personally never been not-amazed at the robotness of Calus. Always catches me by surprise! 
---
Congrats on your first clear, man! How long did it take you?
---
Classic speedrun tactics.
---
You can one rice cake per character and if you have three characters you can get three rices cakes total, one per character
---
Shouldn't there be a "Dodge near enemy" in there somewhere?
---
A thing to add onto this (I have seen some other posts about this) make sure to hold down your aim to allow the overload round to activate, then when you fire it at them, it will cause a stagger where you can damage, just rinse and repeat when they get back up
---
&gt; Steam has a pretty robust anticheat solution in place
---
Not really. Game developers must develop their own cheat detection. All Steam does is allow developers to manage bans via an API call that indicates the client has detected a cheat.
---
Anyone who says VAC does Anti-Cheat detection has no idea what they're talking about.
---
How you feel getting thrown into the middle of a comp match where you didn’t play the first few rounds and you start with no super energy and have no idea how your teammates play until it’s basically too late. It’s not fair to the person who has to backfill any more than it is for the people who stay and play the 2v3 or the 1v3. And any competitive mode in any game is the same way
---
If you leave too often you get a timeout. One really bad day where I actually rage quit for the first time I got a warning, played another game that went horrible and played third one where I Just alt f4 out of frustration and got 2 hour ban on crucible.
---
Resist from posting spoilers for a season that’s currently airing.
---
That's where all of these posts on here come from asking how long their restrictions are. Not sure the number, but quitting enough matches you get locked out of matchmaking for two weeks. Then the next one seems to be a month. Then 90 days. 
---
It just gradually increases if you keep quitting. You've had some bad luck, I've only went in solo so far and I haven't encountered a quitter yer surprisingly.
---
Low light levels will probably not have any mods on their gear as they are constantly replacing them. Or have actual builds for that matter. Pair that with someone who has one and then lets see skill vs meta build + meta loadout.
---
Thats what synthoceps are for. You dont have to shoot, you can just punch from any range
---
Downloading this game now!! I excited for this OMG. Should I save this chart?? its important??
---
Right, but you can't get all 9 in 3 weeks, correct? You would just have 3 sets of 3. Each character would only have 3 each, right?
---
Idk if I'm being clear. If you played 3 characters for 3 weeks, and got a different rabbit each time, then after 3 weeks, would your room have all 10, or just 4 for each character (the 1 automatic one included)?
---
It’s why I ignore the place entirely unless I have to
---
have you picked different mods for different saves and the game is bleeding them into one by accident?
---
Most games, 80% of the time I’m killed by Titan melees.
---
Nope my Hunter has 12 and my Titan now 13
---
hello am xur would you like some spaghetti of the nine
---
Shotgun that shoots smaller shotguns?
---
It’s called an atom bomb it it makes things dead
---
Exotics do drop at a better rate thanks to the new Nightfall implementation, but fuck.
---
Gimme a heavy Trace Rifle pls
---
Damn your absolutely correct.
---
Someone should make one about hunters. Just jump and dodge.
---
Gambit
---
Instead of roll&gt;punch&gt;roll&gt;punch you COULD punch&gt;punch&gt;punch&gt;PUNCH,&gt;PUUNVH&gt;PUNC&gt;©%PUUUUN
---
sorry got a hit carried away but you get my punch.....point.....damn it.
---
Deathbringer is new and kinda the same idea as Gjallarhorn
---
I think you get the quest from Devrim when you beat the blue Earth missions.
---
If we just shut up about it we can Maybe keep the glitch
---
Awesome appreciate that
---
Yeah i am season pass level 106, and i have had about 3 or 4 drop since the DLC released.
---
There should be a blue "introduction" quest on earth. Do that and you will get the smg. Then go to banshee to get the quest for the multitool. Or thats how it went for me
---
Yep that is my feeling as well. Not too hard but really annoying.
---
Meanwhile when I use fighting lion and it blows up directly on someone they don’t die even in momentum
---
I don’t eat enough crayons to understand this flow chart. Maybe that’s why I’m not 5500 yet on my titan.
---
Is that for bows? Because for automatic weapons the overload rounds activate upon sustained fire. Unstoppable rounds from hand cannons need to be aimed to activate.
---
Dad... is that you?
---
The Covenant can destroy planets. The Cabal can destroy solar systems.
---
Dude that would be awesome! I work until 6pm most days, EST time zone here. But I'm free most days after that time or sat and Sundays! Really appreciate the help! I'll send my steam soon as I get home today, don't know it off by heart unfortunately, lol.
---
haha i do that but i wacht you tube
---
\\
---
so anyway i started blasting
---
I do not know which is more terrifying, rushing a control point with three seperate snipers trained on the point..or this.
---
Ayy gwent
---
Thank you! I’ve never been that good at designing my guardians cosmetics (even back in D1). But this is the first time I’ve been proud of my design choice!
---
I believe "light speed for destiny 2" is a mobile app that can save loadouts, as well as automatically maximize your power. I know it's not ingame, but it's better than nothing.
---
How do you get that shotgun?
---
I feel like a huge piece is left out with Rasputin. If This takes place after the events of Warmind a golden age AI designed to defend the solar system could combat an enemy invasion alongside the guardians.
---
Who are we terezi from homestuck?
---
I secone this
---
Wait people do heroic adventures in fireteams? I've always done them solo lol
---
Osprey with blast radius MW
---
It depends on your resilience. I think 10 res is like 201 hp and 5 res is like 191 hp.

exactly finish the bounty so you dont lose it. but dont turn it in until they patch it, and TBH wait until someone braver tests it to make sure its working before going forward!
---
Trash Titan player and you got baited if he was good you would have been dead
---
In space maybe but in ground warfare hell to the fuck no, Cabal are superior in every way
---
Wait, you DIDN'T make a reservation first!?
---
Cuz that’s where it was posted
---
I was running this build in the nightfall yesterday and amazing one of my friends that's fairly new to the game by one-shotting barrier and overload champions. Pretty funny TBH.
---
What class we all picking
---
If I could kill 1 NPC it would be her. It'll be fine, no one will notice a quick shoulder charge off the balcony...
---
Idk man im getting lot of medals each match but medals progress goes up for like 1% per match, kinda stuck :/
---
No I’m on PC
---
I just chalked it up to a kingly speech pattern as in, "this is an emperor's edict"
---
Any high impact weapon can one tap in momentum. Jade rabbit is most used because of the Randy’s throwing knife quest and jade rabbits stability is unmatched for a high impact frame,
---
Aztecross would be proud
---
What a great fight between a warlock and a titan! Better nerf hunters again.
---
Like I said, bows are usable, but their place in the game is quite weird. They function as a weak linear fusion rifle or snipe rifle. It’s dueling capabilities are limited as draw time is usually longer than most weapon’s ttks and its peak shooting capabilities are a bit weird since most competent people won’t repeak after getting hit in the head and will instead run away form the battle to avoid being aped (most people would expect a shotgun to be paired with a bow). I don’t disbelieve that people can reach legend or do well with them, but if you’re playing a competition with the best players, bows won’t be able to hang as well, since you’ll be hit in the face with a snipe or dueling against hand cannons, the ttk’s are just better and you’d have to be lucky to win since they literally won’t miss a shot. I don’t see bows ever being meta unless Bungie says fuck it, and makes bows OHK or have some other broken function, since the reasons stated above keep the bow limited in its capabilities
---
This video gives me anxiety.  Makes me feel like I’ll about to get one shot by a purple laser if I try to run up and take care of that group of adds....
---
*OH-HO hohoho YES*
---
To pair with that one exotic ship that looks like a WIFi Access Point in order to make a functioning network
---
You have to sell your soul to the crucible
---
I'd assume it's going to be one per week per character from Eris considering you can only do the dungeon for legendary gear once per week per character.
---
What about a spider tank?
---
The number one reason players loose this game mode is because they're fucking idiots who ignore invaders.
---
I would have alt-f4’ed
---
Get your hand in the air everybody! *clap clap*
---
That would be awsome
---
For every warlock in Mayhem, there are 4 BB Huntards fucking up the game mode for everyone else

# AND NEEDLESS TO SAY, I SENT THE WHOLE SHIPMENT BACK
---
but its no nut november theyll die if they do this
---
have you played this game?
---
I am in a similar boat. Everyone in my clan migrated to pc and I don’t have one. I am not going to spend $1k just to play the game with them. Even when they were on PS4 they played rarely. I have just been using LFG to find raid groups and help on specific tasks
---
Iron Banner is coming back and you can get The Hero’s Burden. It’s the recluse’s angry slightly less stable brother. I love it and I can go toe to toe with recluse in crucible with it.
---
Kill yourself and see if you come back
---
Run.

*DERRRR DER ER DER DER DER DER DER DERRRR*
---
You forgot the part before the punching where they snort a line of crushed up crayons.
---
Well we guardians dont have any sort of fleet or large cruiser type ships that we can use for combat. All ive seen is small one man fighters and anti air guns on the wall.
---
You didn’t miss out trust me. Horror story kinda sucks
---
How do you get one? Hive ritual?
---
Agreed, I got an exotic from both 950 ordeals i did.
---
Smacked them into the shadow-realm
---
I’m gonna head out
---
I’d recommend looking up a guide for upgrading, imperials are what you use to upgrade the chalice. Do black armory in conjunction with menagerie and you’ll have a good baseline of weapons to work with for any scenario.
---
You forgot Calus big whale able to eat planets. Yes, there was a vex mind blocking it but we destroyed it. And I think the Hive would actually fight because of the sword logic. They see something strong, they have to attack it to get stronger.
---
Yea it's a step or two ahead of where you're at man. Anyways I was able to successfully complete the Amethyst part so you should be safe to do that BUT don't use the forge key you get after from Bergusia. Get it and hold it, find rare bounty and wait for fix.
---
Whatever it’s too late to fix it
---
Garuntee weapon from the first 2 encounters of the new dungeon.
---
Doesn’t Sanguine Alchemy do it too, and for your whole team, but only if they’re in a Rift?
---
I tend to prefer it, but Outlaw lasts a long time when it procs, allowing you to reload much later after a kill shot and still get the extra speed. Rapid hit is pickier. But I consider it to be better overall because it has the stability benefits.
---
Can I call you Ray?
---
If I'm on voice with someone, if an invader pops up I will do what I can to provide intel: "I see him at Command" "He's not on the Beach", etc.  And that's if I'm not equipped to deal with him myself (i.e. I don't have enough heavy ammo to simply remove the problem)
---
if you report bungie does have hardware bans on their end.
---
I think it was two or three days for the "kill hive" part
---
Barker? Dammit. Before...
---
I thought this was 3D rendering
---
Alright, I just looked into momentum control and see it leaves tomorrow at reset, so I think today I’m just gonna go crazy in momentum control and try and get s much scout rifles kills as possible
---
Each class has an exotic that does it too: OEM, Foetracer, Sanguine Alchemy.
---
No Land Before time..
---
OEM was nerfed once already.
---
Eris gives you a bounty to do a bunch of Altars of Sorrow waves, that's how I got mine.
---
Better server connection to Tess’s store.
---
I am the only one when punch as a titan you call it "falcon punch" or am all alone

Now I just wanna punch the shit outta am endless horde of Covenants

And yet people are still howling about it being too strong.

“yOu’Re bEiNg ReAsSiGnEd tO tHe SoUtH wAlL”
---
Oh, I didn't realise they had been gone for a while. I played from launch, like a lot but I kind of drifted away when DLC came out although I bought it and didn't really come back until Shadowkeep.
---
Surely factions will come back though, I mean they have assets to use and it's something to do.
---
Use the revive symbol and a plus one or something
---
Fuck that's a good loop, had me thinking blind well was broken again.
---
You know what, I feel that
---
I like playing vex sexually offended.
---
Im also a new light player and I'm loving the game.This was hella helpful thx! I have a question tho.im a warlock main running bottom tree voidwaker,I heard the exotic helm, nezarecs sin, is really good for that subclass so I decided to try my luck with xur and he was selling it (thx rngesus). So was buying it a good idea or should I have waited to endgame to farm it? (I'm currently power level 840)
---
This subreddit is great. 
---
The users are smol brain trash hunters.
---
Don't do that... don't give me hope..
---
I don't have either :(
---
Glory per win is based on your glory rank and skill level.
---
Bitching about OEM instead of being better is quickly becoming just as bad a crutch. 
---
Kidding 
---
It's much worse.
---
Someone was at "B?"  On this map?  Never happens.
---
So in my case 0 for both
---
No turning back can drop from spider bounties sadly it’s rare as for subtle calamity it’s a regular random drop exotic so no real way to truly farm it except pray to RNGsus.
---
Same lol
---
yaaaaaasssssss
---
Recluse is available. Just hit 2100 glory,
---
Also, Mountaintop is available too, and if you don’t have it, but want it, I suggest taking advantage of Momentum Control; Equip “The Colony”, and you’ll have it in a less than a day.
---
Holy crap you’re right, he had the jade Gambit coin and everything.
---
"What happens if we shoot them?"
---
*The Vex will remember that.*
---
The real question is:
---
Why does your router look like a Hive artifact
---
Very in-depth Titan breakdown
---
Why not both?
---
Hehe I gifted myself a huckleberry yesterday. Maybe next time champ.
---
Now that I think of the length of the dungeon, I do wish that it would’ve had more encounters &amp; rewards. Gear with the style of the final boss is a good idea.
---
I think op means where you see the entire enemy  not just a cross on them through walls
---
Yeeet
---
Yes it is
---
I'm pretty sure the Covenant would mistake the Hive for Flood
---
For primary I would say blast furnace, trust, spare rations, thorn, Ace of spades, and outbreak perfected are the best ones of the top of my head. Also pretty much ANY weapon that you get from a raid is going to be good. For secondary any of the smgs I said are good, but I would also recommend the ikelos shotgun, any shotgun with one two punch, all the trace rifles are really good, and again any raid weapons are usually really good.
---
I accept crypto
---
Go into momentum control with Jade Rabbit or Polaris Lance.  Momentum control is a rotator mach so it will change out on Tuesday at reset.  Head shot is a kill with Jade or Polaris.  Good place for the scout kills required.
---
For Glory...either LFG a fireteam or go into freelance.  I found freelance to be the best option for me. In Freelance your are matched only on your glory/skill level, not your team's.  It makes it much easier.
---
It's not that great in PVE.  But in PVP... especially in Momentum, it's amazing.
---
I hear jumping into that loading area can prevent it
---
Yes, this is my first time getting legend so I’ll have to get in the next two seasons.
---
yeah but on destiny the game everyone just rants endlessly about this game being broken and use that as a platform to whine to bungie about something they’re mad about
---
Description says Festival of the lost bounties count more progress, so don't forget those. And those numbers sound accurate. I think it's about 150 bounties total because one bounty basically does 0.66%
---
You remember that graphic back when Pokémon Go was getting going, with the red leader fighting the blue leader while the yellow leader was in the back eating glue? That’s Titans.

Hey let us help her with her PTSD

No I’ve seen like four or five on the ground since Shadowkeep drop. Too bad they were trash anyway

---
That’s the tangled shore lost sector that’s a a dance club right?
---
No it was definitely not a quest exotic because it was a warlock armor piece from red war
---
Yah I just viewed the sub, you’re right. So that sub has endless walls of texts complaining and this sub has endless titan bad jokes. Not sure what I dislike more
---
Polaris lance is my pocket pick
---
This

Especially since its a free game now, account bans are basically meaningless. It would be far more efdective for an ip ban instead. I do thing bongo has more important things on the agenda at the moment though.
---
is it really that bad at higher ranks?
---
while i was doing the lumia/thorn quest i climbed in 1 day from 0 to 2.3k with rose as main weapon, and besides 3 or 4 matches where i lost, it went pretty smooth.
---
they are on somewhat even ground for the situation they’re both in. titan bad jokes got old as soon as people started memeing oem

Yup.  I can already see what a nuisance that's going to be.

Quite a useful gun for certain quests/bounties... And if you think it looks cool now wait till you see the [ornament](https://images.app.goo.gl/HowEDUZfiSM8yrtw6)!

those mods give +10 each are are available on 2.0 pieces which mean that grinding for gear does matter since the real bonuses start kicking in from 80+ on any given stat.
---
Gotta kill the meatball boss in gambit, then do the associated quest. It’s not too hard, more tedious. Not a amazing gun, but it does technically have no range dropoff in pvp Bec if you land 5 shots the detonation does just around enough to kill.

I mean cabal

Although not as challenging as shattered throne, it was more fun though. Bit short for my liking but that's alright. Would've hated it if the wizard for xeno was part of it, luckily it isn't.

Im sorry guardian, you lost your light.

^ this right here, I also suggest going for the god roll love and death cuz the grind isn’t bad at all, got it within the third try

Ah yes, wild energy.

Oh I get you , it was more around the tiers and pinnacle gear etc.

Should I focus on getting pinnacle of possible then tier 2 items and then tier 1 etc ?
---
Was just wondering which weekly offers the best chances etc to ensure I'm getting them done before anything else.
---
I also miss this map, gone, but not forgotten

That would be amazing.

I got my first we ran on that map
---
Use Sixth Coyote exotic and bottom night-stalker tree. Double invisible dodges
---
That scout rifle buff was great Indeed.
---
What in the hoo ha happened there?
---
Super facts lol
---
Honest question, I don't know the specifics of the gun. Is it supposed to look like it is bowing out towards the viewer in the middle?
---
There are parts of the grip, wrapping, and trigger that show the depth but then you get to the barrel and it looks flat has you move right to left.
---
Huckleberry is still I think the best SMG in the game. Wasnt it bugged at one point? I could be wrong.
---
Just found this page and had the shit happen today.  I thought they were going to overhaul everything now that they’re on their own but seem to be breaking more things
---
The story is really easy. But the end game/post story content is definitely a lot more challenging. Nightfalls, raids, dungeons. The fun stuff basically. That’s the content where you can really start making a build and trying out fun new pieces of gear.
---
if you add another 100h to your game time you'll feel much more experienced and that's without looking stuff up, D2 is alot of exploration (this is coming from a solo player)  
---
Also look up Datto, very high quality information.
---
Its leviosa, not leviosah.
---
Well i did on ps4 and had no problem, was even running on this part too, so idk, my ps4 is a normal one btw.
---
*OOOOOOOOOO* shit teammates bring a sword
---
Huckleberry, Blast F., Go figure and Outbreak perfected. All deal dmg at great rates can (or do) have damge boosting perks. 
---
Headshots not needed
---
Hang in the primary slot
---
 have easy ways to get them
---
Are usually in to PvE metas
---
I would love the experience of going flawless again with NLB

I believe so as in the end of Halo 3 Master Chief places himself in a cryo pod &amp; asked to be woken when he’s needed.

It does but the Xbox One is still currently unexploited.

&gt; They seemed to have changed the spawn time of the heavy ammo within these last 2 weeks and it’s seems to be playing a lot better.
---
They said in in the last TWAB iirc. Yeah, it's better because you still want to control that zone but that forces more "tactic" play (or just camping them with a sniper as before lul) instead of "win the duel, stomp the round".

They have a brain that they need to sustain. I imagine they eat for that unless their body sustains it.

haha i noticed it myself when i was drawing.. its because i used a reference render, and i think it had perspective on the shot so thats why its like that lol
---
one of my first and favori exotics in d1. exotic pulses in d1 were so good. i mainly used red death
---
can u share ur loadouts? i did the last boss using Deathsinger with the debuff grenade and top tree nova warlock, did it in 3 phases

haha yeah i kinda noticed it myself after i finished it. its because i was using a reference render image, and i think the render had virtual camera settings with perspective lol

I feel you. I’m trying to get mountaintop in momentum control as well. Been getting my shit rocked by jade rabbit all day

prime example of someone who's never used NLB. It had zoom. Trust me, it had zoom. And I never said they had to make it use primary ammo.

None of that was photoshopped... get the hell out of here! You are beyond talented, go get a job being a graphic designer or on a video game design team, etc.
---
I blame Eriana for all of this
---
Red death was god
---
Isn't Exos Like overly advance robots that have a soul? Sense before the golden age?
---
It was a gunsmith exckusive weapon, but Bungie added it in the world pool to give us some diversity. Ironic isn't it.
---
Now you only see that thing drop. Tbh it's a very solid rocket launcher with tracking. Just in case you don't wanna use an exotic heavy weapon.
---
Right?! Every time I go collect my clan engrams I have to exit out of her menu because I cant stand to listen to her go on and on and on about how my clan is doing to things. So annoying
---
Just get a fire team and raid 4head.
---
But seriously I'd suggest doing nightfall strikes  and bounties for anything you can.
---
Far less zoom

No boxy sights to induce tunnel vision

I used NLB lmao

And it did in D1, thats like its whole thing :/ its the universal remote of snipers

In d1 cheating was a major thing in Trials of Osiris. Mainly lag switching, where you would literally wire a light switch into your ethernet cable and turn it off and back on. I'll admit I did it once, but it never worked for me, my xb1 would detect it and just close out the game.
---
Absolutely amazing! The colors pop so well!
---
Yeah, one Super for one guy, it's such a waste, most I got with a NB was 5 kills and that's during control
---
They actually came to our aid in several ways, the House of Wolves would have been at the Battle of Twilight Gap if the Awoken hadn't attacked them. Also every Awoken Guardian is one of the Awoken who chose to go help humanity after they emerged from the Distributary, died and then was resurrected.
---
You’re literally asking to remove the core part of the game. Not to be rude or anything but you just gotta push through it and get used to it eventually! I’ve been playing crucible since D1 and I sometimes feel the same way.

Who's Cade-7?

Nope luckily. I was just practicing soloing all encounters in preparation for flawless. I do that to find out what stupid shit can kill me. And i found this.

Yeah no it’s not like people wanted to play the game or anything.

i'm not reportinhg here already reported with bungie. with this post just wondering what community think about this.

It feels like a 1st or second draft.

If only that was a for sure thing, I suffered through that and got nothing useful
---
What emote is this?
---
Red War, Curse of Osiris and Warmind campaigns are a joke in terms of difficulty. Forsaken and Shadowkeep are more difficult, but not too hard.
---
The hard stuff isn’t found in the campaigns, it’s in raids, nightfalls and other endgame content. Campaigns are just for shooting a few trash level enemies and admiring the scenery.
---
No, problem! you're very good at what you do. Even cooler is that most of what you do are Destiny related.

Im using Prismacolor Pencils but its so hard for me to layer and blend. I dont know the technique yet. I come from using Copics, but that  becomes awfully expensive...Is there a special type of paper that works best with colored pencil that you can recommend?

Xbox

Xur knows what you need even if you do not
---
Lol you don’t get it
---
I have Randy’s throwing knife, it’s very easy to get and I have a horrible K/D so you’re just really bad and ignorant lmao
---
Those are the ones. And the occasional Gambit bounty you get from the drifter himself.
---
Where is this bank/vault you speak of? Ive been just carrying everything since start.
---
I'm the invader with hammerhead xD 
---
Tho I don't ALWAYS go in, only when I have something relating to a bounty or sometimes the opposing team has too many juicy motes undeposited yet so I go in there to F with'em :P
---
So alcohol makes you better at the game...
---
It's getting fixed in the hotfix this Thursday.
---
The discount takes it down to a resonable price, its simply done so its only people who actually got the triumph ingame can reonably buy it
---
This reminds me of when I was a kid. I would run at my dad but he would just put his hand on my forehead and hold me back out of arms length as I swung wildly.
---
It discounts them down to like 60-150.   Its so the only people with them are those who earned em by doing day1 raids
---
I personally think Scourge of the Past is the “easiest” one
---
Eater of Worlds has the lowest barrier to entry.
---
Scourge of the Past is pretty similar, but more involved.
---
Ahamkara eggs. You can destroy them with Wishender. Destroying all of the eggs in an area will give you lore and loot, and destroying all of them gives you an exotic taken sparrow.
---
(You also need to shoot all of them for the Cursebreaker title.)
---
This is badass 👍👍
---
I Genuinley thought this was a skin/ornament on a screen before i saw  the title. Incredible!
---
thanks bungie
---
Depends how long you've played the game to be honest lol. It changes slightly on a 4 week cycle as the curse becomes stronger so that could be why it doesn't look familiar. Or simply you just haven't been there for a very long time lol!
---
All the other fallen in this mission are house dusk, which appeared only during d2
---
Its phrased in a way that makes it seem like just what it is, an offer you misinterpreted it not bungie
---
I run multitool as well but sometimes it’s just too chaotic or I don’t get eyes on them until it’s too late.
---
Oh yeah, the "big banker" ones or something(where you must deposit 36 motes or more per match), yeah..... I feel ya...
---
yoot
---
People are just grinding out their Mountaintop and Randy’s.
---
The forges aren't available individually since shadowkeep, they are on a daily rotating Playlist launched from earth
---
Currently the flashpoint is on Nessus I’m not sure about the huckleberry catalyst though
---
Still kind of confused why they would put dusk fallen instead of devils in the cosmodrome first mission while not replacing the house of devil banners or the devil archon
---
Forges are on a daily rotation now that are launched from Earth orbit.
---
Press F boys
---
That scream was in my lfg raid group earlier this week.
---
Good trick

Especially since their magic is basically pure willpower. Basically Bungie copied the Orcs from Warhammer who with enough of them wanting something to happen it will happen.
---
I wish you showed the team DPS. Your fire team must have been using pea shooters! Lol
---
You haven’t gotten any exotics except the season pass ones? If you really want one make sure to do all your “complete 8 bounties to claim reward” challenges and when you’re not doing that do activities with tons of enemies. Like the Vex Invasion or maybe a nightfall since those automatically have a decent chance of dropping an exotic at the end. 
---
I’m rank 108 and have gotten I believe 3 exotics from doing the weekly vendor challenges I was talking about, 3 floor drops, and 1 drop from a nightfall. So I’ve gotten about 7 random exotics give or take this season. By far though I think weekly vendor challenges seem to have the highest chance of getting you one. 2 of the 3 exotics I got from doing that were all in the past week
---
Congrats Guardian!
---
Yikesssssss thanks
---
I mean of course.
---
Why not
---
I thought it was actually the drifter before I saw the title
---
Like files of the Skull's 3d model, what printer you used, sizes, et cetera
---
crouching helps reduce the amount you get flung back
---
They just chillin
---
awaken the warmind was from season 3 eververse
---
Indeed, good luck with the burden. In the flip side though frames can be used at any forge
---
Was this on bannerfall and one of the kills was in the corridor coming out of C?
---
Wow that's amazing
