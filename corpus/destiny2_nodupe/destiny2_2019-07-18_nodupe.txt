i only did it to begin with for bad juju, now i do it for the catalyst
---
---
---
Sorry mine belong to Borderlands, still cool background though
---
I think they were referring to how bungie is no longer contractually obligated to make 4 games in like 10 years
---
Area 51 would be a sick destiny location.
---
I don‚Äôt even have a desire for bad juju. Didn‚Äôt use it in d1 at all. But good god y‚Äôall must be dedicated for the catalyst. Good luck with it.
---
In case this isn't sarcasm, shooting 1k at anything closer than 10m is not smart. Matter of fact, 1k should not be used at all in Petra's run
---
Oh God aeon armor doesn't cap I Don't think so we'll have infinite class abilities. Finally a use for aeon exotics
---
i would stick around on Titan. Mars can get delayed by EP instances and it would piss me off bad haha.
---

---
But you need to stand on the plates to take the shields off the crystals and then shoot them. When the wizards spawn, do the same thing with them.
---
I bought Cades for $10 on Prime day. I‚Äôm happy with it.

im 15 off rn most of mine came from the destinations page
---
thought so, thanks for replying.
---
Locked for comments cuz it just turned into a never ending line of people lighting their torches
---
Oh boy well last word is is pretty easy compared to some others. Some of the harder one are thorn. Last word is fantastic in crucible and probably the worst exotic possible in PVE. I can guarantee a lot of rare hand cannons would outperform it

hunter pve build ~ bottom tree golden gun and nighthawk. Its a match made in heaven
---
for sure I watch videos buddy but I have to admit I would love to have someone to play and do the raids
---
Unless you have other super-boosts, you're making the right choice. Jujuj does pitiful damage to tougher enemies without any rampage.
---
Deleting her health with Izanagi only for it to give her a quarter of it back each time you delete it, before it finally gives up on the 3rd shot, that was a great night.
---
what does quin69 have to do with this

My favorite shell!!
---
The hunter armor looks good, I‚Äôm not trippin‚ÄôüíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Outbreak was always my favorite exotic as well back in d1, still is in fact
---
What does the bubble actually do? As a hunter all I know is I can't shoot through it
---
yeah I hope you have found something in 5 months, I can't find anything anywhere except some bad youtube videos. Nothing is explained in game either and the Bungie &amp; Blizzard sites just want you to buy stuff.... no help for actual players.
---
Thanks!

sucks balls.

Google curse of chaos on youtube and watch aztecross's video

I see this as an absolute win.

Whether we wanted it or not...
---
How about running BOTH Rat King and Outbreak?
---
nope
---
I got rat king a few weeks ago, I wanna participate, but first lemme get breakneck
---
You're welcome! And thank *you*, I was really conflicted about how I felt abt the whole thing but you articulated my feelings perfectly. It was a fun cheese and it's sad to see it go, but Menagerie is still the best PVE event we've had yet and people need to appreciate that with and without the cheese.
---
People should also appreciate Bungie letting us play with the cheese for two weeks. Most companies would've just fixed it immediately and told us to get over it.
---
Never knew that. Interesting
---
:)
---
Brave for you to assume that destiny will make it that far ( I love that game and all but a story gotta end somewhere)
---
yea the melee is nice on bottom tree but other than that i know people think the roam super is busted and base are their bias on that.. its actually funny how clueless people are that gripe about the titan.
---
It has one of the coolest animations in the game, it should be able to destroy bosses with the way it looks
---
Ah a man of culture I see.
---
just give it more bones or more taken textures
---
It's takin me a long time to learn how to maximise them, but I tell you it's so nasty dude. I have some clips of them paired with chaperone that are straight savage. I've deflected nova bombs, grenades, grenade lanlunchers, dawnblades and all other kinds of things. Plus the improved slide is very nice. Give it another go! Its my fav exotic and I have a hard time using anything else, they save me multiple times a match at least.
---
This would make such a neat exotic GL ... BUNGO PLS
---
I did it with Izanagi on the Shattered Throne boss. It felt really good.
---
Any rapid fire shotgun will have the highest DPS as far as legendary items go. Threat level and Ikelos being two popular choices. 
---
Personally, I use Lord of Wolves more than any other shotgun in pve. It does boss DPS comparable to heavy weapons. 
---
I have heard that shotguns with the perk one two punch are great for killing major enemies, but I don't own one of these yet.
---
I just know the information from one point as I don‚Äôt keep up with all the twabs, I apologize but none the less the bounties exist to boost you for raid ready

Bad Juju, AKA the tickle monster for bosses
---
I've seen it happen 3 times on PC so far
---
I didn't believe that story.... No proof to back it up ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but hey he got his upvotes
---
It literally happened to me on the first playthrough. Still liked the twist, AND I could even revive him.
---
Though I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not supposed to happen...
---
Plus they have genericfiresound.mp3
---
at that point you just give up raiding ever again

Hey good job at letting people know what platform you're in on.

I prefer to call you guys troubleshooters.

You find trouble and shoot it.
---
Well it happening and him being able to be revived implies that it was programmed in like that. We never really have NPC allies so it‚Äôs hard to say if there‚Äôs a sort of groundwork there for like health and revive and stuff for everyone.

Oh dw its just a BLADE BARRAGE WHICH DESTROYS EVERYTHING IN THE GAME‚Ä¶im a salty titan main
---
They didn't change the actual look of shaders, that was a menu thing, and they wouldn't take old footage and filter it. They have no reason to do that. They also wouldn't show a gun that looks like NTTE and just kinda not have it be that, when it's a FRESH NEW dlc, covering NEW things.
---
I think its 50 but I haven‚Äôt gotten to that part yet so im probably wrong.
---
But you'll still have the tier 2 synth, so you can't get the other tier 3 armor, right?
---
Before you get to the bottom, thrust sideways on the sparrow, idk why it works but it does
---
No. Just take it slow and you will be fine
---
Its the allegiance quest from jokers wild.
---
Oh what, i should return the game?
---
It was apart of one of the story missions on the tangled shore and it had you buy something from the black market but after you complete that you can‚Äôt go back to it again
---
I'm guessing any platform, this one was PS4
---
Yeah i know but i meant how they updated shaders menu thing maybe they are updating how guns look like making scratched and stuff more 4k idk. Who knows but im 99 percent sure that model is from the forge pulse
---
&gt;##judgment at hand.
---
You can set up a fireteam on the D2 companion app, just put your region and that you're open to teach, or try and find a fireteam looking for help. That's how I got found.

Both paths are a waste of time unless you are into lore/ story. I didnt even do em bud, all you get are a few powerful drops and some consumables

You cared enough to reply to your own comment lol

That is gonna be gone soon

He‚Äôs new give him a break I bet that is the only stuff he has

Agreed
---
Yes, I always have used God mode for flying instead of noclip.
---
Appears to be the atrium from the movie "Passengers".
---
Bro if u look at his character when he spawned in he is low level and probably doesn‚Äôt have access to all the late game weapons
---
&gt; obviously they coded the possibility for him to die, OTHERWISE HE WOULD NOT DIE!
---
Bugs and glitches exist. Software is not perfect. It's possible for something to happen that's not what the developers intended.
---
My reasons for playing with others is bitter-sweet. But before you take my or anyone else's opinion on this subject, make sure you consider the facts:
---
* Making playlists that require teams or other players to complete, maintains a larger player-base. 
---
* Free to play games need a good sized player-base in order to ensure micro-transactions are profitable as not all who play will purchase them
---
* All attempts to complete raids without a team in Destiny 1 were patched. 
---
* The most powerful Exotics in the game can ONLY be obtained through raid-completions.
---
* Dungeons in D2 can be completed "solo", but only with the use of specific weapons/loadouts. Skill is secondary to gear.
---
Because of this, it would appear that Bungie is not concerned with you "being good" at this game and completing anything "solo". They want you to rely on team-based play which will promote a larger player-base. I prefer playing solo when it comes to difficult activities. However because I am only allowed to use the weapons and load-outs that Bungie says I can, I have far more fun when playing with others and not focusing on the list of grind-demands that Bungie has forced down my throat. Basically, playing with others lets me forget about Bungie trying to dictate what and how I play this game.
---
Come to think of it, I only ever take the stairs on the right....

I agree entirely OEM is a crutch but i dont see Bungo reworking barricades be cause its probably the single biggest reason why titans cant compete, still dont use it though
---
Titan bubble is so bad main characters get killed to two rockets
---
[removed]
---
You don‚Äôt need to generate notes, just kill the guardian in gambit before they kill anyone on your team, basically just get a ‚Äúnot on my watch‚Äù medal, for the kills it‚Äôs around 50, but I think t might actually be less because by the end of my game I had 98%!

Yeah im asking about pc

How do u unlock the menagerie. I r been gone a long time and I just picked it back up

Zavala is literally on if the best Titans in the lore, that's why he's the Titan vanguard.
---
Bungie is taking their sweet time but they‚Äôll eventually will patch this out, along with LoW. Hopefully.
---
When you get a full team wipe with arc web
---
Golly... We got it bad
---
It makes sense more wise but that‚Äôs not very good and it‚Äôs usless in PVE. I would say let the souls float longer before disappearing and also allow the effect to stack up to 15 seconds instead of 10
---
Correct me if I'm wrong (I'm not) but didn't we avenge cayde anyway? and zavala is still alive and well
---
People are still just now finding out about this??
---
:0
---
It depends on the following factors (I may be wrong, this is just based on my experience),
---
1. Region (Japnese and Chinese players are sweaties)
---
2. Matchmaking
---
* Players in my team (if players in my team are better than me then or on par with me then we have better chance of winning) 
---
* Players in Opposition team (If players from opposition team are sweaties who spends everyday playing crucible, with better weapons and skills can out gun us 90% of the time. Ideally matchmaking should put me against players of my skill level but thats my luck.)
---
For some reason the nanites generated by outbreak seem way more useful for ad clear then auto reloading and rampage, especially with the increased nanites damage from OPs catalyst
---
So kinda like how titan was in D1 minus the shoot through
---
Beat the Forsaken story missions and then an NPC named Werner gives you a quest.
---
Just leave 1 add for the empowering.
---
That‚Äôs on bungies website I believe (I may be wrong) it‚Äôs 15 USD
---
The shoot through seems to strong for PvP . I would say the simple one is just an exotic that adds weapons or blessings of light
---
my mates real toxic haha because he knows tryn plays Destiny as well lol
---
The seal is time limited but yeah the triumph page for the hall &amp; therefore juju isn‚Äôt.
---
My teamates were good every match. That being said I was usually top or second top on the board. It‚Äôs definitely not my own skill though, rngesus blessed me
---
Removed, see flair for reason
---
\*why not both intensifies\*
---
Here's the issue. We shouldn't have to use an Exotic just to make a class better. Well by it self is REALLY DAMN GOOD putting Luna's or Phoenix protocol makes it even better. Titans in general are basically useless in PvE aside if Melting point. Warlocks do what Titans do but better in every way. Titans just need a overall change with a good change to exotics. Titans basically only have OEM going for them and that's mainly PvP.
---
I think you can do it if you haven‚Äôt started it on your second and third character
---
The spawn point is artifact's edge I believe.
---
Super fun to ride/jump from, plus it's near a forge saboteur, forge entrance, &amp; a public event that is pretty easy to solo heroic(destroy the cabal ship that appears around 30ish% capture).
---
Left handed?
---
in movies and games mainly, not real life tho. Reason is mostly that we have males characters and females characters are cheap and mostly whores. Destiny got amazing females characters tho and also male characters. It is a personal preference mostly, nothing really against male or a propaganda, just I prefer female protagonists and female characters. Like boys die for Shaxx lol
---
How can you ‚Äúnot be fond of‚Äù male characters. Like all males? What?
---
Way to sneak in Destiny from Finding Dory!
---
Boop! You're wrong too! The moon is called Luna.
---
oh lmao i thought that said sword xD have you got the ace of spades
---
Did you even read the caption? Hahah
---
there will 100% be a D3. The devs have said that theyc annot keep adding to D2 as its already to big of a size (100GB atm)
---
only kinda
---
No not yet just half way through the forsaken campaign I might do that now to break it up a bit, is it long or no ?
---
Oh, I just figured it was cause it looked like a burst from LoW but it still sucks though, you were basically on top of him while attacking but no damage
---
Its has the same activation time as most of the other supers I believe. If it was an instacast it would be wildly unbalanced.
---
....yes, I'm pretty sure Bungie has played their own game üòÇ

oh my god

Ahh fair one - what have you got to do to get the ace of spades?
---
It's not timed
---
What does it have to do with juju? I got mine w/o doing a single forge.
---
You can easily identify an ape based on the striker tree they pick. Even though bottom tree striker is hilariously OP, they'll pick top just for the shoulder charge.
---
I can get behind that. I feel like claiming that [all] female characters are cheap and mostly whores is a little off the mark, but I don't have any examples readily at hand. Destiny definitely does right by its characters so far in my experience. 
---
Thanks for answering, and for keeping it nice! &lt;3 These topics oft can get out of hand very quickly.
---
Are you forgetting all the PvE aspects i.e. Celi nighthawk, tether, flawless execution, infinite knives with brawler, ophidia spathe, and mid tree gunslinger, and some amazing ad clearing supers? The reason that they're so good at everything is because of their strong neutral game, high mobility, and one of the best class abilities in the game. Titans need a large PvE buff to be relevant there, seeing that their only real endgame ability is melting point, and hunters can even do that. Titans have: shoulder charge, suppression grenades (nearly useless in PvE), infinite striker super, OEM, and a homing shield that shouldn't have the ability to lock on as well as it does. Titans are geared to PvP more than hunters ever have been.
---
I replied before. It is my preference in stories, just that. It should strike me to like the Characters. Like Rick Grimes on TWD, Cayde and mysterious freaky Drifter. So based on my preference I said I am not fond of male characters.
---
Op is likely referring to the fact that tethers do not fire quickly from the anchors.
---

I agree with everything you said, but stating that there's no point in having the updated version if it doesn't count towards the catalyst is overdramatic, in my opinion.
---
You'll be able to use the combination to full effect once the catalyst is completed.  I don't know how complicated it would be to change it, but I'm certain I'd rather they be concentrating on other things.
---
Ah, yeah, I forgot about that. To me that suggests that either Petra shot him or we both shot him -- I would think it's canon that Petra definitely shot him, but it's up to us whether our guardian did. Personally mine would not have.

See you misinterpret my post.  It‚Äôs about adding these things and not eliminating the identity.  Stealth sections of missions or strikes but not a transformation of the whole game.
---
I've been getting connection issue with comp since yesterday, I'm pretty sure it's server-side because the same thing is happening to my friends scattered all over the place.  So far I've been getting disconnected at least once in an hour, and since I'm playing comp, I also get penalized for "leaving an incomplete match".
---
I just had one not even a minute ago, literally 4 or 5 seconds from match ending (in a win no less, I finally played half decent for once) and I get ditched.  And because it's the second time in the last few games, now I'm suspended.  Gee, thanks.  As if playing comp isn't aggravating enough already.
---
And fix the flash. That thing blinded you after every burst.
---
Looks like a comp sweat
---
Ya but why use that when u can use well
---
My Hunter ass gets the light punched out of me every time I encounter that super in Crucible, it‚Äôs hilarious! I‚Äôm glad these Titans are on our side for when Savat√ªn comes for us. For training purposes though uh... maybe ease up on us for a while eh Titans? Light guide us all.
---
me forgetting the fighting lion sparrow

I always take the right stairs, but I think the reason for it was I got in the habit when matchmaking was bugged and it was slightly better if you went slowly along the right side of the entrance.

ATS 8 Arachnid
---
Dude clearly this type of game is not for you, I been playing D2 for over 1 year and the game is far from boring, you need to see all the content, all the raids all the loot, 80% of the ppl playing maybe have 1/3 of this game done and I'm in the same boat I bet.
---
Oh and the game has more than your rant has to offer..
---
I think they just need to extend the range for rat pack. The leash is too short and makes it annoying to try to use for dmg. The clutch invis is great though. Got me through the thorn strike when it first came out!
---
I saw that and I physically recoiled.
---
Most lfgs are chill with teaching as long as you let them know you're new.
---
One, congrats on getting not forgotten! I thought of getting it before the nerf, now the only reason i would want to go to legend would be for unbroken title which, i mean, i'm sure i could do, but with my crew, we can barley scratch the fabled surface. Just isnt on my list of priorities atm.
---
Second, if i get bagged, i just kinda ignore it, dont feed into it. If they wanna be upset let em. If they message you, just try to go in a different perspective. Mention that maybe if they want, you can play with them sometime and maybe go for those pvp pinnacle weapons (doesnt have to be not forgotten, could be luna).
---
Third, if they keep harassin ya, ultimately just block em. That is the one thing i never got about cyber bullying: you can just block them, or turn off your xbox if need be. Obviously, if it gets to be a personal situation to where they have your ip or some shit, yea, get like cops involved, but those are extreme situations.
---
Overall, happy you got that gun! I recently got mountaintop and been havin a lot of fun with it, listen to some light hearted music to keep ya calm, or find another outlet to mimic it, and as one great community member said: say no to rage
---
Have a good day bud
---
My experience with LFG in the Destiny 2 community has been pretty good. That's literally how I've learned every raid. I've heard it can be nightmarish though so that's part of why I've been sherpa'ing my clan. Make sure to be patient and take it slow when explaining to newbies.
---
Believe it or not I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs that great of a strike. But how the boss fight is broken up into three platforms with giant rocks flying by has created a lot of funny ass moments for me and friends while playing it, so that‚Äôs why I enjoy it so much haha

Connection issues have been rampant since the launch of destiny with errors popping up all the time i remember them happening in trials for a bunch of people. Posts are always made about bungies servers it is not a new thing.
---
That's the first part of this quest and its much easier than the other two parts.
---
I have gigabit internet and i to havent had major problems but there always has been problems for a good amount of people ever since d1. This is something that should have been addressed years ago.

Huge facts, the memes were fine before, but now I see why r/destinythegame banned memes
---
Yes. Get the Forsaken Complete Collection for $39.99USD before the sale ends. Has all current content (Base game, Curse of Osiris, Warmind, Forsaken, and the Forsaken Annual Pass.

Perfect example of what angers me ‚ÄúOh he‚Äôs so toxic I hope he doesn‚Äôt need mental help I feel genuinely bad for him I can‚Äôt imagine being that toxic oh my god Do yOu nEed ATteNTiOn whAtS wRonG‚Äù
---
I‚Äôd bet top dollar you‚Äôre the kind of hunter that just complains about titans being to overpowered instead of just playing on one or just shutting up
---
I would say yes,  but only if you want to do some *serious* catching up, there‚Äôs a LOT to grind for.
---
Whyd your mate tether?
---
great gun name
---
trash gun
---
I THINK NOT!
---
Download speed past 24mb doesnt matter for games what matters is the strength and ping

He figured since he has it might as well use it
---
I'm getting desperate can someone help me with tribute hall I need to do the raid tributes
---
I'm sorry, but it hurts my brain to watch you reload that gun.
---
Give Solar
---
I only go right but for the tangled shore lost sector in thieves landing where you take the lift up I go left through the door
---
I literally just made a titan, so I can compete in the Crucible. Thanks for trying to generalize me. I was genuinely concerned. If you want to talk to someone, I don't mind being your punching bag man. I am at LL 380 on my titan now, and I already have a OEM I am pumped to jump in and take over crucible so I can get these pinnacle weapons!
---
I dunno about that, I see people passing me and I them all the time in raids and strikes when we are sprinting
---
And now all I hear is how much you and your fire team are making a difference
---
Nice! Another useless softcapped pulse rifle!
---
I‚Äôm terribly sorry to inform you about the level of wrong you are
---
Mobility only affects strafe speed and jump height.
---
I always corner jump lmao
---
It would be pretty funny if the final raid boss for shadow keep was ‚ÄúThe Architects‚Äù
---
There is a lot to do every day now compared to launch. Like a LOT
---
Because he didn‚Äôt want to avenge Cayde
---
I went in with a grenade launcher and shot me down and just took my time on every enemy with a weapon with decent range
---
Alrighty. I realy have stuff to do thanks to you. :D Also thanks for the light background. Sleeper was realy weird with the old one.
---
It‚Äôs already dead, there for, haunted üòÇ
---
For sure! Hopefully I actually get around to it, been talking about it for awhile now, still working on learning C# so I can code it &gt;.&gt;
---
Technically not ‚Äúoneshot‚Äù
---
I see what you mean. Sometimes when all the good jokes have been made, memes go to shit, but don‚Äôt let this distract you from the fact that whether we wanted it or not, we‚Äôve stepped into a war with the cabal on Mars. So let‚Äôs get to taking out their command one by one. Valus Ta‚Äôaurc: from what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an imperial land tank outside of Rubicon. He‚Äôs well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold
---
It can be hard you need two others atleast
---
Are you on pc or console and what power level are you?
---
Source?
---
I don't share your greed! The only gun I need is the Ace of Spades!
---
&gt;I set a bush on fire with one
---
The pyro
---
Definitely easier with a fireteam.
---
You're on PC and you can't even print screen?
---
Whats the difference between the Forsaken Complete Collection and the Forsaken Anual Pass?
---
Helmet looks alright with the right shaders
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and my power is 710 if I use my good gear
---
i have no words for how amazing this is
---
Console with a power of 710
---
Cayde dies, spoiler btw
---
Literally before Forsaken came out it was kinda obvious with Cayde standing on the barrel of his own gun for the cover art.
---
Doing your daily and weekly milestones is youe best chance.
---
I use ace during strikes, and use last word on crucible
---
Ok get two more and you should be able to do it quite easily
---
Tbh I pick top tree for those spicy double pulse grenades, especially if I have a grenade kill quest (don't have the mats to infuse armentarium yet)
---
Nothing really
---
Where is crown of sorrow
---
Does bungie still have that thing where you can find fireteams looking to do the same thing?
---
I just can't stop looking at the thicc booty even though I want to.
---
I did but that's cuz those slots aren't having something else put in them
---
I love what you did for Two-tailed Fox, looks sweet!
---
I just applied; hope I did it right, and that I'm not to far back in the game to be accepted. I'm certainly an adult, and I just got the D2 app, although I've had the PS App and discord for a while.

---
I did it it‚Äôs not that bad you have to go through all campaigns and unlock supers but that‚Äôs it you keep all progress and if you put the gear in the vault you can put it on the new titan
---
I‚Äôm sorry I have to admit I bought it after Croats end. I am not a true vet feelsbadman
---
I didn't wanna spoil that for my girlfriend since she just started playing and loves cayde as a character, it got ruined for her when I was turning in a box to tess and she was peaking over my shoulder, she saw that he dies and got really depressed for the rest of the day.
---
Gambit is the dude with the scarf around his head yeah?
---
Don't worry you are still a Guardian who has lived a crazy time in d1.
