It's well suited to Destiny 2's ancient controller options. They haven't hardly changed at all in the 19 years since the launch of Halo: Combat Evolved

You called?

When ur shoulder charge literally one hits guardians, but ur still not satisfied with it.
---
Nooooo eyasluna kicked too ugly for me it was like hawkmoon which I also don't like
---
I use the better devils which is closest aside from ace to the imago
---
Wait what's this about farming a chest? I haven't heard of it. Can y'all explain pls.
---
Garbage game mode is frustrating enough.
---
I still think Burning Maul needs a buff as well...cool super with meh damage but Thundercrash is an absolute turd of a super...just like Titans are right now
---
Ok first of all I'm going to ignore those hurtful comments about my two favourite guns, secondly you could put a counterbalance mod on the austringer to fix the recoil?
---

---
If you don't like that my only other suggestions are using nation of beasts or the kindled orchid
---
If it’s actually you, I’m actually very sorry. On the bright side, mayhem ceases to be for now
---
Would you comment on [this megathread?](https://old.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bzjpkr/official_lfg_megathread_v_4/?) Just trying to consolidate things a bit.
---
Oh no oh god 10 crucible bounties AaAh I’m nowhere near as good as I used to be in the crucible
---
Would you comment on [this megathread?](https://old.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bzjpkr/official_lfg_megathread_v_4/?) Just trying to consolidate things a little!
---
Yeah it reset on a sunday- not sure why though, I expected it on a reset day but unless it was a glitch it’s a weird schedule.
---
What sniper is that?
---
fate cries
---
Ive seen it bfor, wheres it from?
---
Nah, just bad humor on the internet. Never have been and never will be married. Good on you, though.
---
random crucible drop
---
Because OP knows how to party!
---
It can, but they watered down the tracking a bit.
---
It wasn’t really f2p, just a limited-time offer. However, it will be going semi-free to play in September, with Year 1 content being available for free.
---
Please check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bvr9ex/official_faq_please_read_before_posting/) for a full list of patch notes since this time.

---
You have to do it all individually I believe
---
What do you play on?
---
I don’t really know if you are karma horeing or if I should feal sorry
---
$300 and you would have to install the padding and lenses as well as any magnets.
---
I play on PS4
---
Dreaming City gives significantly lower powerful rewards than anywhere else. I did Dreaming City first knowing this to just get it out of the way, I went in at 700 and left at 703 after 3/4 Petra bounties, Blind Well, and Shattered Throne. 
---
Everything else worked perfectly fine for me, I managed to hit 729 last week and I only have 1 character. I didn’t do any raids, Gambit Prime, or Reckoning.
---
you can get your exotics from collections anyway
---
Doubt it they already said they have long term plans for D2 multiple times. Also why would they spend all their resources fixing destiny 2 from the ground up if there was a game coming in a years time. I don’t think we’ll get D3 for atleast a few more years
---
The one console I don’t have the dlc for :( sorry I can’t help. I would recommend doing your strikes and crucible and gambit daily’s, adventures anything to get to level 50
---
You should open a support ticket on the Bungie forums if you think the game deleted your stuff - it’s not likely anyone here can help as the devs don’t frequent this sub. 
---
However, it sounds like you haven’t played in a long time so you should be able to recover any exotics you had, as well as a lot of the year one items, from your collections.
---
&gt;I don’t know if the devs come on here
---
On the sidebar the very first thing below all the normal reddit stuff like the search bar is: "This subreddit is not associated with Bungie in any way"
---
You are supposed to make bug reports on the Bungie forums.
---
If destiny is a documentary from the future is crap your pants.
---
The last 10 light levels are gotten in increments of +1 to +3 iirc.
---
This is actually a meme that goes all the way back to d1 as I recall. There’s a tweet out there that says basically the normal conversation on the panel. And a guy (who’s user I can’t currently remember) made the panel in response...... and it’s been reposted ever since
---
When I do this, it's because the team I am with is not equipped to deal with reckoning and that is why we failed. If we fail for some reason besides lack of equipment/ability, I always stay.
---
They also said today at E3 if they do make a destiny 3 it will be well after the new consoles come out.
---
Someone in my clan said werner's bounties are not doing powerful.  I can't confirm myself though.
---
Gambit prime
---
How’d you get this?
---
As long as its grindable I’m good. Thanks man
---
whenever I use hunter in pvp, it's either Knucklehead Radar or Liar's Handshake.
---
It's actually at the Spider if you dismantle it, the Drifter has it if you didn't accept it in the first place. Or at least, that's how it was last season, it could have been changed. 
---
This quest is currently bugged and not complete-able, as you can see from the "known issues" list on the bungie website.
---
"Dread it, run from it, Destiny always arrives all the same..."
---
Moons haunted
---
There was no dramatic change to TTK via stats or anything. #BUT# everyone's rank in crucible reset very recently, last week I think, so you have really really good players at low rank because they haven't been able to play crucible or whatever other reason, so you're gonna be facing players that are a lot better than you are for a while until the ranks even out. I don't know how long that'll take but I hope it's soon, I can't get out of guardian with either comp or quickplay.
---
Made out of baby hive!
---
Someone must have lost one too many crucible games, lol.
---
Go away. If you aren't happy with the game, go play something else.
---
Rivensbane is pure rng son, my friend literally got all the items in a week. Petra's is only "slight hard" part. The math isn't that simple btw
---
Lets not get hasty, both would be nice.  
---
There does need to be more return for the risk of diving into enemies.
---
I would just like a decision to shoot the drifter then turn around and shoot zavala, ikora,
---
Make shax and hawthorn leader,  Or just rule yourself
---
But mayby I have been playing to much fallout recently
---
Yeah if you've been buying all the dlc as it releases like I have then this game is quite expensive but what problems could you have with cosmetic only micro transactions? And who cares about a y hour story in an rpg? You play it for the grind and literally everything except the story.
---
You know Activision is gone right, and bungie is actually making changes to better itself now that it's escaped Activision. This post was very true pre forsaken but it feels slightly outdated now.
---
Point 1: What time are you playing at cause if you play too late you usually get sweaty 4 stacks. It's best to play around 2 pm to 6 pm
---
Point 2: Use the destiny 2 companion app there is always groups looking for players to grind comp
---
Point 3: You don't need to follow the meta it's often better to use something you are comfortable with that what is meta, not everyone was born to use Chaperone Sniper
---
Point 4: Don't think you are somehow too good to not use dick weapons like shotguns you're only goal is the gun just get it
---
Point 5: Jesus Fucking Christ don't grind the comp playlist unless you have the mental health to do so. Just play a couple games a day and you will get it eventually you only need a 1.0 W/L ratio to get this gun due to win streak gains and the removal of loss streaks
---
Point 6: Due to the fact that most people are going to try and get revoker use weapons that are good against shotguns, play in their face and don't let them get into the positions they want to
---
Point 7: You can get this gun, trust, it just takes time and if for some reason you truly can't, the destiny community is great and someone is willing to help
---
"Pure rng" ok?  Only the items are you still have to run the encounters multiple times in different ways. You still do encounters with different strats and a bad raid group isn't doing Petras run. Also in this case math is that simple.
---
Ye no it isn't. I finished all those triumphs within a week. Challenges as soon as I could. Still don't have cleansing knive, not that I care about the title.
---
Lolol
---
depends on your current light. in the 740s it drops +1
---
Yeah, I need a friend too
---
shader is gift of the nine
---
Thundercrash counts as a melee and a super. I've tested it. Also increases the slam damage
---
I don't remember any major change to prime engrams being announced, but I might have missed something. Does your prime attunement buff go away after two?
---
hey that’s me there :)

Looks like an Atari!

It’s per character.

somebody gets that supers arent what makes a class. Also bottom tree striker titans are frightening. i love dying to one and then dying again as i spawn on the other side of the map...to the same guy.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
To be fair though dawnblade does laps around maps now. SB is a lot easier to handle now (snipe them out all the time now) but they still have some nasty mobility. Gwinsons needs a nerf.
---
thats me flashing my sword!
---
What happens when you hover over it? Meaning, what error message does it display? If you don't own the annual pass, you only get one free trial run and then it says "buy the annual pass" if you try to do more.
---
You do realize that the Vanguard are proficient in all 3 classes which is how and why they are mentors to other guardians so just because Cayde favors solar it doesn’t mean he doesn’t know how to pop a tether or an arcstaff
---
It says players do not have access to this activity. I do have annual pass
---
Sometimes it’s because they completed their bounty, or the run isn’t going significantly.
---
shoutout to the guy flashing his sword blocking me out of the group pic lmao
---
I was able to get 3 today

There is only one titan spec and it’s fists of panic

Are you wearing gear that puts you below power level 690? Are you on a character that has not completed Forsaken rather than the one you did Menagerie with previously?
---
"Kinderguardian"...absolutely my new favorite word EVER! Thank you!
---
at 699 using same character
---
You’re ew

Fs?

That also I liked deactivating the bridges every time someone almost landed

I'll do my best!

Benedict Cumberbatch vs The Warner brothers LETS GET READY TO RUMBLEEEEE!!!!!!
---
Honestly if you're playing pve use clusters and in pvp the only rockets that are good are truth or wardcliff. Truth will probably waste your exotic slot in pve when you can use something with more damage and reserves like sleeper
---
u/Simansis ‘s “Entirely True” posts about nerfs would just become... entirely true!
---
Tell me you used the coupon at least. nice pic 👍🏼
---
Forsaken got bundled with year 1, so you're not paying extra for that, it's just included for free.
---
However forsaken will soon be bundled with the annual pass for around $40, or maybe it is already I'm not sure. You'll have to Google or ask.
---
They said on the live stream that they were gonna bundle everything together to stop confusion.   The way Activision had them doing it was just stupid hard.  Had like 5 different packages.  So now it’s all in one.  Easy peasy.
---
Which one ?
---
What was your loadout?
---
You did brother... Yes you did.
---
Ok so in the live stream they said they were going to make it easy for everyone.   They bundled all the things from y1 and y2 in one convenient place for 40$.   That’s the only one you can buy now.
---
Malfeasance, Distant Relation with full auto+firmly planted and 21% Delirium. On my last reset for the ghost.
---
I believe the timeline is more 300-400 years for the Golden Age, then roughly the same range for the Collapse.
---
So I gotta buy that way even though I've already got Destiny 2 expansion 1 and 2? What about the Forsaken annual pass?.... Thanks
---
Not that bad of a grind, go for it
---
Everywhere in the dreaming city where you can find scorn enemies.
---
F
---
I'm just saying I'd behave differently as an actual guardian than I would as a player playing a guardian.
---
Year 1 drops with the limit of the expansion it came with I think.
---
Dammit.
---
I played crucible to level up between campaigns.
---
If it is impossible then why have people, including myself have the gun?
---
I might be down if I have time, solo'd lunas and recluse the past 2 seasons
---
Breakneck when you don't run out of ammo.
---
Is there any activity that has a higher drop rate on the green runes or are they just very rare?
---
You'll have to wait til reset, they only drop once a day, sorta.
---
On the contrary, *don't* kill the ones in the lost sector. They don't drop the badge for some reason.
---
Just take a look at the ornament for the Revoker...  It's just glorious with precursor vex Chrome or calus selected...
---
Join a discord that has the Warmind bot installed. There you can use commands to see which weapons are used. 
---
 [https://warmind.io/](https://warmind.io/) 
---
It can also do a lot more, so it would be worth it to create your own server and set it up there.
---
I want it just to have it because I'm a terrible shot so it might help me in PVE, Sniping in PVP is a special kind of hell for a shaky handed fucker like me.
---
Thanks guardian 😇
---
My best advice is to never play alone. Relying on your average blueberry to pick up the slack is never a good idea. I know LFG for comp sucks on PC because I tried it this season for revoker. Luckily I managed to drag my friends back to play comp this week. 
---
I probably won’t be playing this week as I’m waiting on the reset to give me my points to get Mtn Top, but DM me for my battletag and I can help you get last word and any other popular weapons if you don’t have them, I also wouldn’t mind helping out with comp after Tuesday. The grind for Recluse isn’t nearly as hard as the other two past pinnacle weapons, you just gotta get the ball rolling and try not to let losses get to you. Best of luck!
---
I wouldn't think about Destiny 3 for a while. Luke Smith said yesterday that there is no focus on that but on the things to come for the current Destiny experience. 
---
I think, we will see progression in this "story" in destiny 2. But not with Shadowkeep.
---
get annual pass and progress the chalice quest. it’ll get you 690 instantly
---
That's why you get 180 in the first and 120 in the second rank.
---
Destiny has some weird ass porn dude. Whatever gross perverted idea you have, guaranteed someone already drew his female guardian getting her itch scratched by it.
---
I love how you get downvoted for trying to help someone out.
---
By the way, same thing can be done using Furmious Blue, the shader you get for completing the Red War story on a hunter.
---
Sounds about right.
---
Ok then
---
I tried doing the bay of drowned wishes ascendant last night with my hunter and using stompees, but man I just kept falling off and finally said fuck it.
---
 Maybe I'll try again sometime, maybe someone could help me out, I just have a little tougher of a time with them. 
---
I wanted to bang it out before they fix the bug with Petra but oh well. Gonna wait for a different ascendant that I can maybe do.
---
What season are we in now
---
7, it days in the directory
---
So there will be more after Shadowkeep?
---
Yes 2 more dlc that we know of
---
Isn't outbreak really good?
---
It hurts when one of the best pve loadouts is locked behind pvp.
---
It’s what he would’ve wanted R.I.P. Cayde-6
---
What I would do is look up what quests go to what guns and chase those !
---
Really the only boss that has sustainable reasons to hunt down and kill is the Fanatic because he revives himself.
---
Crucible / gambit / strikes without a fire team is ALMOST unplayable right now.
---
We woke the hive
---
Anyone tell you look like Sugar Shane Mosley?
---
What?
---
They won't be the only reason shadow keep is somewhat big is because it's the 3rd year of the game being out
---
Still waiting for the exotic version that shoots mini explosive Edge Transits.
---
I kinda like the idea of truesight on any Nightstalker tree. I haven’t gotten the chance to actually *use* it yet, but it sounds neat
---
“That wizard came from the moon”
---
We did. An Awoken Fuckboy.
---
It's less that some people don't HAVE the time and more that some people just don't care. They just want to play the game and think looking at the triumphs page at all is a huge waste of time, I know multiple people who think that
---
And looking up guides on YouTube for anything except maybe how to do an exotic quest theyre stuck on or a raid? Also waste of time to them
---
It’s the start of the new season so all those sweats haven’t ranked up high enough to be out of our way
---
Greasy devour
---
Used to help people I'm my clan got like 20+ runs/teams done with it only a couple people said thanks... its not much but its honest work
---
I’m gonna be real with you. I laughed out loud at the title of the video
---
It better be that we can use it as a sword when the gun is out of bullets
---
Fucking fallen cpatain
---
Well it’s only week 2, you can get a head start or wait til later
---
This is going to inspire planet Neptune being introduced to destiny
---
You dirty bastard. Mine rolled with the reload masterwork. Still, heck of a gun.
---
My first Drang had Swashbuckler and HCR/Flared Magwell... with Quickdraw.  So close.
---
Uh
---
1000000 imperials
---
Yeah but what does the masterwork do?
---
This is me when you first land on titan and go over the "screaming bridge"
---
I use counterbalance on mine. I tried one with major spec but couldn't manage the recoil.
---
This one is a real slog. Even if you end up with a couple people that just jump into the Blind Well to farm it takes forever. Far, far worse than the fusion rifle last season.
---
I've been playing almost nothing but strikes for several days and I'm at 1100/1500 200/500 and 70%. It's a numbing grind. I really suspect the tracker is not consistently tracking kills, especially multi-kills, too.
---
I think the drifter says we're the first person he's trusted in a thousand years and he's a dark age guardian so you're probably right
---
Yeah guns like Thorn or Caydes Will that require both PvP and PvE I don’t mind, I just hate that the recluse is a monster in PvE and can only be gotten through PvP, and that the Hammerhead is amazing in PvP, and can only be gotten through PvE
---
Top tree sentinel represent
---
This is a game where you can literally be a space wizard, and your worried about this? Lol 😂
---
The only stuff I'm aware of that you can miss out on is cosmetics and events.
---
Using a fusion against teleporting enemies brings physical pain
---
Probably sweaty PVP players invading then.
---
Fair enough. I honestly think they kinda did it on purpose in an attempt to help the comp population, which as someone who loves pvp and hates long queues, I appreciate. Though I can also understand the frustration of those who just genuinely hate the crucible
---
Ok, thanks.
---
Prime usually isn't so bad, it's just regular gambit. Then again, prime forces you to kill the envoys, so that isnt really a fair comparison.
---
I don’t mind playing the crucible every once in awhile, but I’m not a huge fan of it, it just feels like CoD with longer TTK and a few abilities, but the grindfests that require 10+ hours of crucible makes me hate it
---
Yeah xbox. It'll be around midnight then here but if we didn't manage to get it done until then I'd gladly accept that offer!
---
what do you mean redeem the triumph
---
Good try my friend! I like the effort!
---
Fucking Minotaurs
---
Drifter: "One of you shall betray me..."
---
Funnily enough he and Fallout did almost the whole quest together with True Vanguard (I was watching TV’s stream as they were doing it). So, exact same journey but recounted in very different time frames 🤣.
---
*Clap Clap*
---
Bold move sitting at the head of the table
---
I used to work as a technical illustrator making manual diagrams. I didn't make the engineering drawings but I used to work with them a lot.
---
Yh, all my friends either had one in pursuits or got it right away. I been running around in DC for way too long
---
Its one thing to use AFK bots for rumble, but its way worse when they use it for strikes/gambit/quickplay. If they stay in rumble then at least they won't force anyone to lose and can instead be farmed for hard to complete quests.
---
That's such a Titan thing to do :,)
---
Crucible is going to be pretty bad but gambit is about to have a queenbreaker 2.0 event. I’m ready to get exploded from across the map
---
You forgot to mention , please use a double bow Loadout for this game Type to maximize damage output!
---
I got the feels when he swiped the window and Master Chief was floating there
---
*Maximize damage output to you teammates' mental well being
---
That was a Slayer, reaper is six. Still crazy, nice throw
---
problem is if you let people pick maps then there will always be a map or two that don't get played.  And then those who actually want to play those maps will have a harder time finding matches.  It's the same reason why you can't pick your gametype in quickplay, because nobody would want to play certain ones.
---
Found the titan
---
I agree it's stupid in reckoning. No need for a stomp mechanic that you can't Dodge on a small bridge. I. The menagerie though, just don't stand next to him.
---
But if I dont like it, it should be removed from the game! /s
---
Didn’t know tweets could be 10 minutes.
---
This. I'm pretty crap at crucible so I avoid all the content related to it. Yeah it's annoying I'm missing out on stuff that looks cool to play with but is what it is.
---
"Moon's haunted" is from an old meme on Twitter. Bungie just revealed that we're going back to the moon in the next expansion, so now everyone's using that meme.
---
What set and shader is that?
---
(F)rick
---
Entitled lol ? I bought something, and they made it free. Aka, it was an early access f2p game.
---
Nothing about entitlement. Destiny 2 wasnt worth $60, never became worth $60, and only brain dead idiots kept on supporting Activision by putting any more money into it.
---
Guardians: *Gets on the bridge*
---
Every major that spawn there"I'm about to end their whole career."
---
The truth's tracking is insane and 3 rockets in magazine...i found it op in gambit, crucible and pve is fine.
---
So I won't have to re-buy Forsaken again, right?
---
Power level?
---
You don't need Forsaken for Shadowkeep but it's a nice addition and really worth the $40 it's going for right now. Check the FAQ for more info.
---
AFKers in Comp?
---
What a total dick move.
---
You have to actually shoot the bow. I got my first Overkillmonger triumph with a bow, so I know it can be done.
---
I'll bite, how?
---
Fucking taken captains
---
Hoobie initialy, then business
---
did that count as a successful completion?  :P
---
Yeah I definitely think it should've been a bit bigger based off the price but I'll take what I can get
---
Have you seen the new raid set for hunter??? I know not everyone has access to it but it’s unreal
---
Me: *shoots in the general area of a taken captain once*
---
Taken captain: *teleports behind me* “nothing personal kid”
---
I did check the FAQ. 
---
I didn't see anything mentioning Forsaken and what it was/included.
---
Got any pics??
---
My biggest issue is the damn Esc from the event. You complete the forge, go back to match making screen, and have to spam Esc (on PC) until you back out. Other than these issue though the Forge is still pretty dope to do.
---
Is this an r/woooosh attempt?
---
Cause you just said Warlocks have good looking armor.
---
Concept art I believe.
---
Edit: Found it https://www.artstation.com/artwork/q5vwa
---
I'm assuming this dude is the concept artist because the description talks about how Bungie's art director steered him away from the boxier designs of other Cabal ships and architecture in favor of the more curved and opulent design that ended up becoming Calus's whole art style. Pretty interesting actually.
---
Edit: I'm stupid. It also says "Concept Artist at Bungie" right under his name.
---
Unfortunately not 😂
---
Did you let her smell it? It smells faintly of mint.
---
You can open the cheat 5-6 times per run if your fast
---
And Anthem can stay faaaaaaaaaaaar away.
---
The biggest step to this is getting all 3 rune slots opened on your chalice. Next is farming for those runes, pvp mayhem was best but sadly that was last week so just rumble grinding and getting up to 200 runes. Now you have the runes and you need to deposit them, which means opening the Menagerie chest . So if you have 3 on your chalice theres 3 down. Then do the multiple chest glitch, I was a hunter with max mobility, Stomp-EE5, and Mid tool and mini for max speed. If youre fast enough you could get up to 5 -6 chests a run, so in turn you're using 15-18 runes a run. SO thats all in all about 14 runs with 15 runes each.
---
turns out i cant finish forsaken without leveling up a bit. stuck on the Barons
---
It’s explained on the second time through the curse cycle. Everything that isn’t paracausal is forced to repeat the same actions every three weeks. Paracausal forces, like Guardians, are able to move freely. But all parties remember previous curse cycles, paracausal or not.
---
The Hive are searching for a way in to the Awoken birthplace. That takes time that they wouldn’t normally have, so they placed the Curse on the Dreaming City. The thing is, they still need to remember information from previous weeks so they don’t check the same thing over and over, which means that the Curse has to let everyone remember what happened, but forces non-paracausal forces to be the constants while paracausal forces are the variables.
---
To put it simply, the Awoken remember what happened but can’t do a thing to stop it from happening again.
---
Does anything special happen after you give all the cats their small gift each?  I know we get a weapon or gear, right?  Anything for getting them all done?
---
*I’m so proud of this community*
---
Tough tits mate
---
Google it
---
Captains are literal aids to fight, however during Primeval the knights are the worst since they make it impossible to stand in the well of light without a rift or well of radiance.
---
It’s just as obnoxious on PC, unfortunately.
---
Yesssssss, good meme
---
Haha that’s all I saw in the Shadowkeep reveal
---
Here’s my experience, I’m not going to pump myself up to much but yesterday I dropped 29 kills on a 4 stack in comp and I almost always place first on my team however I still can’t make it out of heroic 1 and brave 3. I would consider myself a very good crucible player and I do play the objectives and don’t farm kills but I still lose. I know I can’t blame my teammates because that’s scummy but I just don’t understand how I can’t make it out of the lower ranks it really does piss me off sometimes since I can’t figure out how I could improve since I already win most of my gunfights with relatively skilled weapons like the last word and snipers. Also I play pc if you want to play with a relatively skilled player whose sharing the same experience as you than HMU

I only play one character, usually at least 2-3 hours a day, 5-6 days a week.
---
I think Prime Attunement definitely effects it. The  buff stacks, and I'm not sure if it has a limit.
---
There's a pretty big difference here; you haven't played for a month and got 3 exotics in a day, I play 2-3 hours every day and have gotten 2 exotics over the course of 2 months.
---
The only other explanation is I just have shit luck.
---
Yeah I'm super sad that the only way to get recluse is through a broken PvP system. I got within one match of Fabled last season and then had a bunch of teams with AFKs, people leaving, and games starting with 1 v 4 or 2 v 4.  It really bummed me out and made me hate comp even more. Of course as soon as they change the requirement, they bring out a pinnacle gun I have zero interest in. I just want a good SMG!

Will ps4 purchases carry over to pc?
---
The upcoming Lumina quest.

In the leviathan? Because that same line is in a cabal lost sector and it's just part of the background music
---
It's ok, not a big user of bows as I suck with them. Wishender has a long charge time so find it difficult to use. My favourite bow is Trinity Ghoul
---
My man

Included with a purchase from bungie store
---
That’s the literal point of taken ogres
---
Not comp thankfully but in the weekly playlist and rumble yeah
---
cursed_instruction
---
I’ve yet to see afkers in comp. this was in showdown. But the point still stands
---
Yep
---
Bungie should remove you simple fucks that can't kill an ogre .
---
He shoot,  
---
He boop,  
---
but most importantly,

***HE WENT SPACE GAMBLING WITH VUVUZELA AND HE'S NOT COMING BACC!***

Exactly, a lot people were saying that "oooooo Ghaul is coming back" and then saying "maybe we can get Cayde back too?" I saw a few posts like this yesterday and I felt like saying the reason we won't get Cayde back is for players that don't have Forsaken, since it isn't required to play Shadowkeep, (It wouldn't make sense to those new to the series or have lived under a rock to avoid spoliers) I REALLY felt like telling them the reason but I don't want to break there hearts with Cayde shapped holes.
---
I *would* finish the quest...if I could get a fucking Corsair down to drop
---
Unfortunately yes
---
Yep. I usually go HuckB just to kill lots of thralls/acolytes/dregs, etc, but bows like LeMonarque can be used to clear ads with their AoE
---
XqC plays D2?
---
It's important to note that Power Level is not the only controlling factor. Some events, including that Arms Dealer strike, are "Prestige" activities, which means that your Power Level will be restricted to the level of the activity. That is to say, on the 300PL Arms Dealer, like on Whisper, or Zero Hour, or raids, being higher than recommended power doesn't make the activity any easier.
---
The other thing is to know which activities are meant / recommended for groups. That strike is basically nightfall difficulty, which, while certainly *doable* solo, are meant for a full fireteam. You're struggling in large part because you're doing a challenging, group-targeted mission without a group.
---
So, while the other guy who responded is correct that you can do the power surges to up your light, and get into some Black Armory forges to build better meta weapons, the quickest and easiest solution to the difficulty is to find some people to play with either via friends, a clan, or the LFG app.
---
Thanks
---
Ya on ps4? I can get you through it twice np, got some friends that gotta do it anyway.
---
No HS required, just gotta follow the route.
---
Edit: typo
---
The new titan lets can one hit a super sooooo I think that pretty good...
---
Check postmaster. This worked for my friend
---
Even worse are the servitors that teleport *you*.
---
Cause it's part of the story to show that she really is gone? And she just didn't leave her little throne world for like a few days? Like I can't roll my eyes any harder. 
---
The OP commented as to why they don't know why it's happening you called it lazyness. I mean it could be like WoW where you just redo the raid cause reasons. 
---
In destiny you are redoing the dreaming city because of the narrative. They at least had the foresight and creativity to build in a reason.
---
Look here.

Got mine on first drop plugging in the runes they list.
---
Christ, can you imagine if you had to get Crucible rocket launcher kills for the quest?
---
I'm still fairly new to the game and don't quite get what this means can someone explain how to make a public event heroic?

Credit u/Tobess_ for the format
---
Filthy good legs if you can close the gap soon enough, definitely agree. The titans and warlocks got the good exotics and I guess it’s the hunters who bungies gonna shaft this season. Just my opinion though.
---
A thanos snap to a guardian.
