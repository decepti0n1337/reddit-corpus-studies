Gambit just needs to rot away. It had a whole season to itself, now it just needs to stay out of the picture.
---
---
---
Yeah except I'm trying to get Luna's howl and trying to get precision hand cannons kills with survival mode is infuriating considering you get limited lives and clash and control are gone. Sigh.

Buying expansions is fine with me. It‚Äôs cheaper than getting bored of stale content and buying new games hoping they scratch the itch
---
Jes√∫s man, I was rooting for you to hit something
---
Reminds me of the Roblox memes
---

---
Go commit Breakneck
---
For the moment yes long term not sure but it is known as the daito room
---
Ok I was wandering what those other 2 were.
---
Which one is the main raid?
---
Personally, i think either effect of OEM needs to go. Either it gives wallhacks for getting hit (still fits in with theme of the exotic) or it provides healing, damage and overshield. Either or. Both is just too much for how strong each individual effect is.
---
That would be leviathan
---
Yea when I made the post it wasn‚Äôt yet in the game. I‚Äôve farmed about 15 of them so far looking for a god roll, definitely one of the easier ones to farm
---
I really like the pve part of it tho. The only problem i have with it is that its kind of boring, and not really competitive as it is.
---
Just looked that up and wow, that would be a pain would prob end up like a checker board in 32x32
---
Yknow what man, I'm sorry. That was an unnecessarily douche-y comment. If you had fun doing this then i apologize. I'm trying to throttle back my asshole tendencies.
---
What would be badass if someone 3d printed it out of metal and made it a real pistol chambered in .50 desert eagle.
---
You still can?
---
Very good. Not elite.
---
Here is the thing though, I don't own shadowkeep. But I'm able to join just fine. Just mainly trying to see if this is a bug or not. All my searches I did before posting came up dry on this matter.
---
But in cell shading that‚Äôd be awesome, maybe push it so far as a borderlands art style
---
Nah man that‚Äôs all good.
---
I'd differently take wall hacks
---
I feel this in my soul. I did this the other day and literally wanted to just log off and go to bed.
---
I'm having fun with the Hush bow but wish it was kinetic so I could do this lol
---
Id say with A quick google images search you‚Äôd be fine. It‚Äôs just such A novel gun I‚Äôm sure plenty of people would love to see.
---
Crawl ling in my sleep
---
Rare photo? I see this weapon atleast 3 times in one Crucible Match.
---
Origin Story is an amazing auto
---
I have been wondering about that
---
Yikes
---
Uh it isn‚Äôt real, it‚Äôs fan made and I used an old template I had
---
Personal preference is Gnawing Hunger
---
‚ÄúWe are just playing casually lol don‚Äôt get so butthurt üòÇ‚Äù
---
Leviathan which is the raid. 
---
Then you have Eater of worlds raid lair which is the earier of the raids.
---
Then you have Spire of stars raid lair which is the harder of them.
---
Look for a box that you have to open
---
It feels pretty good to golden gun 15 motes across the map.
---
I'm not sure how to help you exactly but I'd suggest switching for "broken" guns
---
F
---
Yup in inventory,  opened it once than had to press x . Never seen again,  not in the shader section either
---
Stop dying lol ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This guy must be a blatant troll.

Looks like a clown mask lol
---
Don‚Äôt quote me but I‚Äôm fairly sure catalysts that were once faction exclusive now have a chance to drop while playing regular activities.
---
When you switch from console to pc ü§°
---
holy orbs thank you for this information
---
I'm trying lol
---
It doesnt look like a AR, looks like an MP5
---
You take damage and can even die, the increased damage is temporary but in crucible the extra damage generally means a free kill.
---
One Eyed Mask is perfect with the right weapons. Idk much about it since I am not a PVP guy
---
Agree. This would be a nice system and it would make certain things highly sought after like the midnight coup was in year one and even somewhat in year 2
---
You're definitely a one eye scrub.
---
Ok. Thanks so much!
---
Is that a beach ball ghost
---
Enhanced reload mod for SMGs and Recluse comes with feeding frenzy, fastest reload you can get practically.
---
I literally feel like destiny pvp is the most basic pvp out of any game out. Compared to games like bf or cod it‚Äôs very easy to pick up. You can easily get multiple kill streaks just by running around as a titan melee‚Äôing people. I‚Äôm honestly surprised. So far through all the crucible matches I‚Äôve done I‚Äôve yet to see a very good player just dominate.
---
His ass is a fucking freight train
---
When I downloaded it the warlock wasnt centred?
---
Several bosses scream lol
---
Yeah
---
??
---
All forges should be unlocked for all now
---
you dont have to watch it
---
It's a random drop from crucible. Once you obtain the catalyst, you can progress it to apply it in your jade rabbit. All catalysts, barring quest related exotics like bad juju or outbreak, must be obtained to progress and apply.
---
You're the chosen one of your own story. Those other blokes are just hallucinations brought about by soul-crushing depression that all your Guardian pals may very well be a fine paste down the side of the Tower for good.
---
Or some vaguely motivational garbage like that. I don't know, man, you do you.
---
https://photos.app.goo.gl/YMmF7yZY3iGfL28k7 not even in my inventory bro
---
On a serious note. Please explain why you feel that exotic is balanced compared to the other classes?
---
I think destiny has really good pvp
---
:/
---
Lmao i forgot about how they did that
---
What about it
---
U give it to the small rabbits on the moon.
---
Thank you but it's a mini bounty inside the quest and I can't seem to find it
---
Its because of the artifact mods, as a PvP player I‚Äôm not thrilled either
---
Yup lol
---
Jesus fucking Christ
---
On the topic of cheaters, i hope we get some sort of death recap in pvp to at least reaffirm your suspicions of aimbot
---
[removed]
---
Not really lol, that's not how it is.
---
Ha, nice. I got half way through an EP with some randos once before we realized we were clanmates.
---
Oh look at you maxing out your glory already you're so fucking good at crucible I'm not jealous at all nope not me.
---
Nice
---
Look down before you SLAM JAM
---
This was one of the best parts of the Shadowkeep campaign. You pick up the Cryptoglyph with an escape plan, and suddenly everything goes dark and you are about to get killed by EVERYTHING down there. Suddenly the only plan is to run as fast as you can.  
---
Personally I wouldn't trade the memory of me and my friend barely getting out of there for an easy teleport.

controllers will always be more elegant than mouse and keyboard
---
sure aiming is easier and theres wayyyy more buttons to press on k+m but theres a reason people people get wrist injuries using keyboards. controllers are just so much better feeling to use
---
Its not even that good. Yea the trackings useful but if i get marked i just bail on the gunfight and reposition. Every class has health regen exotics, wormhusk for hunter, some gauntlets for warlock. The bonus damage isnt that much and rarely changes time to kill. Every class has op exotics
---
There‚Äôs an LFG subreddit. And discord groups are good places to ask. Some youtubers have discord‚Äôs and there‚Äôs some community lead ones.
---
Rice cakes=rabbits on the moon. 
---
Mints/gifts=cats in the dreaming city.
---
That‚Äôs it, lfg. Surely you can find a very raid-active clan to join. Check bungie.net forums, clans are always looking for members.
---
I think what OP is trying to say is that a lot of people grind out as fast as humanly possible and then gatekeep the rest of the community just getting to level from easily playing said content. Which is a fair gripe, I think.
---
Lol I just got anarchy last night and all I can say is that I feel sorry for the fallen especially the dregs
---
Yes the game has done this since d1. It will give you highest gear possible even if highest gear is on another character or in your vault or postmaster
---
Turn down graphics maybe?
---
Yes I'm like 90% sure.

Step away the cylinders of colored wax, Sir.

It‚Äôs not unreasonable to expect a spell check before uploading something.

New light player how I I even do forges I got a quest form the forge person but don‚Äôt know how to start a forge
---
Respect the drip hawthorn
---
As someone who's only getting into D2 now because of New Light.... this is exactly how I feel.
---
That would be ergonomic, not elegant. Mouse aiming is more elegant because regardless of how the game is displaying the environment, it boils down to where a point is on a plane. A stick on a controller can't translate that topological transformation as elegantly as a mouse on a desk can.

No the weekly objective, where defeating challenging vex grants the most efficient progress

*checks* Yep. Guardian is definitely down. Down there.
---
That one I'm not sure. Maybe check bungie helps known issues and see if it's there. If not you can make sure it's seen.
---
Absolutely. It‚Äôs so frantic for the first half, and then it gives you a few seconds to just bask in the scale of the Scarlet Keep.. [[shivers]]

How do I wall run in Destiny 2? I skipped that part of the tutorial that doesn't exist.
---
Dude same. Could swear most of my shots were flying right through people, and I quit after only 2 matches cause of it.
---
I actually commented there a few days ago. Didn‚Äôt expect any replies but some actually came.
---
How do I get to the tower? If I remember correctly, it was in the "Map" section but mine is empty.
---
Well even though I love Destinys PVP an all i love CODs multiplayer layout. 
---
I wont say Nooo that some devs are working with destiny cause fresh looks can be great for developing a game. 
---
If anything the cod revs are probably tired out of their minds of "make another cod for Activision" since that is what they do.
---
Take infinity ward that have made some amazing games in the series and I bet they have some great fresch looks on another game.
---
Do it in the order I have listed and yeah you need to do it with at least one person who has it currently or has completed it already
---
I haven't noticed it, but I could see it being a thing. I would just ask for hunters to get a one hit kill melee also.
---
Is it wrong that I'm still using Sweet Business? I love that gun so much when it got upgraded to 750 I was so happy. I just infused it and honestly Sweet Business is fantastic. Are there other Miniguns like it?
---
I‚Äôm fine thanks, was joking about shotguns but OEM is stupid and I‚Äôm fine with handheld insta killing but the new armour makes them regen way too fast with certain builds
---
Oh you sweet summer child.
---
If not then you can get it from xur (he comes every weekend) or from exotic engrams (nightfall is the best way to get them)
---
Agreed. OEM probs needs a nerf on the health regen and overshield. Feel like a bump of health like Wormhusk, or or the overshield without regen would be manageable. Titans are kinda OP, in general, which I don't have a problem with as a lowly hunter, but our Wormhusk got nerfed just based of regen, so OEM should def get a nerf. Shotties and Handheld Supernova? Yeah, just get good. It's not OP. I wear Stompees as a hunter, and jumping to the heavens seems to be warding both of those tactics off pretty damn well at max glory level, so I imagine it's even more useful in casual and what not.
---
You can put that thing right back in the vault where it belongs and let us never speak of it again.
---
It‚Äôs in the destinations tab. The map tab is for the location you are currently in. It will be blank if you are in orbit.
---
You can do the moon right away if you really want to.  I would do strike/gambit/crucible until you get 900 though.  Get bountys in "town" and try to do them.  It's pretty quick to hit 900.  
---
You could also go do whatever planet you just unlocked if that sounds better.
---
Nigga is that Vertical Orbit?
---
No, totally agree, I think Handheld supernova is awesome for Warlocks. Think every class should have it's own version, as a handheld lightning ball or fire ball would be equally lethal. 
---
Hunters need some love, too.
---
I had the opposite issue I'm collecting parts and her bar shows 0%
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm starting to see the build more and more and it‚Äôs insane. Instakilling everyone. I like it the way it was before since you had one attempt to kill someone before it had a decent length of time to recharge but I‚Äôve been seeing people get them every 10-15 seconds, sometime faster if they get a kill with the exotic gauntlets.
---
Agreed!
---
It's a cool gun and I can use it for non raid PvE content?
---
Yes
---
As long as it is still in the same season you achieved Legend, I believe the answer is yes. Currently in the same situation.
---
That sounds super broken. That's definitely understandable for a nerf then. I haven't seen that yet, but I'm sure I will. Moderation is key.
---
I feel attacked
---
Because I want to take the easy way out on something I don't enjoy to get a reward I will enjoy is bad mentality? I'm not good at it and I don't enjoy it, why would I not ask for easiest way to do it?
---
Risk and reward Quest
---
Like 10 other smgs could have done the same thing in that clip. Precision frame shotty could have done it even quicker.
---
Eyyy I‚Äôm doing it solo. At around 4600 now
---
Okay, so just rng I guess. Guess it‚Äôs time to grind some more. Thanks!
---
I was joking with shotguns, hence the ‚Äòapes‚Äô I added, I‚Äôm not talking about needing supernova so it doesn‚Äôt one hit etc, I‚Äôm talking about the build where you get it constantly. I‚Äôm slowly starting to see the build more and more and the recharge rate is insane. It‚Äôs mainly the exotic gauntlets with the new armour set combined that makes it so every encounter you have with them they have a supernova.
---
Find a weapon that suits you well and pay close attention to the radar.  Also you dont always have to aim down sights, especially in close quarters.  They can just jump over you and now your dead.
---
I personally love the exotic scout rifle from xur today and a 900 rate of fire sub machinegun.  I'm sure some exotics can help put but I'm doing well enough with that set up so far.
---
I'll check right now and let you know if it works.
---
Yup!
---
Its 5 weeks of ep use the tesseract ability on tier 7 boss
---
A+ for effort.
---
Thats just putting yourself at a disadvantage in anything pve related.
---
Background mechanic. As the season progresses you'll see why she needs all those parts. It gets kinda annoying picking them up all the time.
---
I actually have another question though. Is it possible to give weapons to other guardians?
---
Nope. You can trade with other people. You can grind together though. It's fun seeing which person gets something first.
---
The only thing I would've been okay settling with is if a hunter's dodge avoided a Titan's OHK. Like it is hella obvious when it's about to happen because they are mindlessly running at you, and no amount of recluse shots or melees are enough to stop it if they aren't brain dead about when they start. Point is, my dodge should be enough to avoid it, but the auto aim just adjusts. God forbid they have OEM which 90%, and you tryna kill them as they charge actually ends up giving them a great buff to slay your teammates. 
---
In short, I'd be fine without a OHK as a hunter if the dodge actually dodged this, but it doesn't.
---
So you want the worst crucible experience that we had in year 1 of d2
---
I really don't care if I'm meta for non top tier pve content dude... I'd rather use guns I enjoy for easy content.
---
\*again
---
Hey Guy, remember factions...... *cries in FWC*
---
F, but thx anyways.
---
Bergusia key is behind a separate quest, that you get from ada. 
---
Helps if you check people like Datto out on youtube.
---
I‚Äôve seen your username posted in here before lol
---
uh... bad bot? idk
---
wish i would've known this before i spent fucking 3 hours doing the steps for the izanami forge...
---
We don‚Äôt do that here
---
But then again because solo is generally harder people are sweating even worse.
---
The amount of bottom tree striker, oem using, recluse abusing Titans I've seen is stupid.
---
Also did they broke oem again? Because it feels the health and oversheildd Regen is back to being instant or near instant.
---
Wilsooooon!
---
Yeetus deletus!
---
Just hit 902 today (-2 cuz artifact). I mean yeah i could but especially now getting to 950/960 even, fashion is out of the question and many if not most of the sets that i consider good looking are probably never going to be an option again. From what i understand is that if i'd be on 950 or 960, i'm tied to whatever armor i have excluding ornaments and of course i'm going for the gearscore since i wanna do raids.
---
Did this on my Warlock last night. Warlock jump sucks so so much.
---
Oley.
---
"Classic mix" is a pvp playlist where connection is more favoured for matchmaking rather than the players' skill. Which means theres no reason to go "sweaty" except to mess the enemy team so hard all fun is bascially gone
---
Wdym by sun/moon disabled?
---
I have it and use it and still think it‚Äôs for pussies
---
Yeah I just noticed this while farming it. Killed like 30 enemies with my arc melee ability and the percentage didnt change at all...
---
Ya but atleast we can "wear" last iron banner gear with the new armour perks. So I think that's why they're moving towards more weirder designs. Now you can pick what you look like.
---
Ngl tho, Winters Guile and devour warlock works super well. Can 1 shit most things when stacked with one two punch.
---
You sound super angry about recluse.
---
Bring back light beyond nemesis
---
Or just use recluse seeing it still has stupidly low ttk in the first place.
---
Like why would giving a gun that had a already low ttk an even lower ttk after a kill. Wait oem I forgot some of the devs don't know what non broken gear is.
---
It‚Äôs so good that me, someone that hates Destiny PvP and is truly awful in crucible, is now trying to overcome his hatred and grind out the mission to get it! No, it‚Äôs not going to get a nerf...yet, that‚Äôll come on the day I finally get the thing!
---
The last key, you need to get a mold from ADA-1 but she doesn't give it to you. So you might as well get all 3 key pieces still and hopefully they fix it soon.
---
is the quest to get Thorn hand canon only available to forsaken owner?
---
"Typical titan idiocy."
---
They don‚Äôt explain it at all
---
You go to the moon. And hang around where the public events are. A giant vex portal pops up in the sky and starts dropping vex. You kill a couple mini boss vex and one big boss vex. You should get it then.
---
Complete the first step ikora gives u, then u get eyes on the moon
---
Ok bet! Thank you
---
They will find their way to us. Do not fret brother. The time of doot loops is almost soon us
---
i feel attacked
---
lol pc player vs console players. i‚Äôm on ps4. there is no text chat. there is an in game chat feature that is turned off by default because nobody wants some rando screaming in your ear during a public event to like or subscribe to their channel
---
also, at least on ps4, my experience is that using the in game fireteam chat makes the game lag. most people use the psn party chat running outside the game. so you wouldn‚Äôt want the in game chat to interfere
---
One eyed mask you say
---
they should rlly add a channel that focus on recruiting like WF
---
I dont see a lot of people talking about this, but for me its the most op weapon ever created lol.. no reload, accuracy, aoe chain lightning.. wtf why people dont like it?( pve )
---
Scouts and Hand Cannons
---
The forge is bugged right now.
---
What system are you on
---
Yeah that's fair I mean I've done it now I was mainly wondering if there's a way to experience the D2 intro at all? Is it part of the D2 core story or is just not a thing any more?
---
They changed the amount of kills / medals you need to earn for the triumph by a huge amount
---
People die when they are killed.
---
You're just trash kiddo, deal with it
---
Guardian train being led by a titan. 10/10
---
Titan leads train off a ledge.... oof...
---
Wrong way to say it
---
Ok thx
---
I was just thinking about this dope ass map the other day!
---
nooooooo
---
thanks
---
No problem at all, keep up the great work
---
That would be dumb if they didnt
---
we have alrdy seen this meme dude
---
copy &amp; paste
---
Bungie knows that K&amp;B players would have an advantage over those with a controller especially in comp play.
---
Nvm
---
They have an extremely small chance to randomly drop from enemies, and have a slightly higher chance to drop from powerful gear sources.
---
Some specific exotics only come from quests or certain activities.
---
There‚Äôs an exotic vendor called Xur that appears on one of of the main destinations on Friday and disappears at weekly reset. Just use whatever search engine to find out where he is.
---
You can also get them from Nightfall: The ordeal in the Vanguard section if the director, but that‚Äôs kinda difficult.
---
Still not fixed! 
---
I'm not even playing a Titan, aaaaaa
---
Should definitely put your preferred platform, ie. Ps, xbone, or pc. And there's a specific sub Reddit for this stuff. Can't remember what it's called but someone will comment it.
---
Very, VERY true
---
That‚Äôs odd. You know he‚Äôs dead right ?
---
Yh, I stopped playing after I lost my warlock in forsaken and recently picked it up cause my mates did (for new light)
---
https://www.the100.io/ is a good place to start
---
we normally schedule raids in advance but you can get some adhoc lfg requests for it, saw some last night
---
Can't we crossplay with PC now tho? Or just cross save?
---
Are there any other exotics that lost a mod with the armor 2.0 update?  Orpheus Rig (pictured above, old &amp; new) doesn't seem to have the "Traction" mod anymore.
---
Just gonna copy and paste this from the last guy I commented on. Some stuff might not be relevant here but oh well.
---
(And you aren‚Äôt meant to solo raids)
---
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîCopy paste‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
---
There isn‚Äôt any order that you have to do raids in. Some are just more difficult than others.
---
On that note, raids aren‚Äôt your everyday strike/scenic tour. They all have multiple encounters with unique puzzle mechanics, and are often highly unforgiving. They don‚Äôt have matchmaking, and the game doesn‚Äôt explain them to you.
---
Why would I put myself through all of that hell you ask? Loot and bragging rights. Raids often yield the best loot in the game, have their very own unique exotic weapon, and grant large power level bonuses. 
---
So how can I learn to do these raids,  and where can I find people.? There are many guides to help you with raids which you can find in r/raidsecrets, YouTube, and on the internet, but experience is often the best teacher. Subreddit‚Äôs like r/destinysherpa are full of people happy to teach.
---
To find people to do it with, you‚Äôll need to use LFG, or Looking For Group. This subreddit has an LFG megathread which gives you many different LFG platforms. 
---
You can join other people‚Äôs raid posts, or make a post of your own. Some people may have requirements on their posts such as KWTD (Know what to do), a power level requirement, or having completed the activity before a certain amount of times. Some people are ridiculous with their requirements, but just leave them alone. Look for the posts that don‚Äôt have said requirements on them, especially the ones that say willing to teach.
---
Generally you‚Äôll need a microphone or communication device of some sort to raid, and more than 2 brain cells. With that out of the way, I wish you luck on your adventures.
---
Edit: Forgot about prestige raids. Prestige mode adds in more mechanics to the standard encounters, and raises the difficulty of the enemies you‚Äôll face. As you‚Äôd expect, it has has its own exclusive rewards. Whether the rewards are better than that of playing the raid normally is debatable.
---
This is Mordor
---
Yeah it just looks cool
---
What? I found warlock super easy, just fly over everything
---
You need to tap l1+r1... If you hold them you can't Ward off Dawn but if you just tap them you can sentinel shield
---
Im having the same problem as you pal
---
But if you want the shield and not the bubble then I personally prefer bottom tree... And that way you will always cast sentinel shield (no bubble)
---
No dumb questions about Destiny... Doesn't exactly have an informative loading screen or in game guides... Haha.
---
I died just thinking about it
---
I think it really depends on jhon good you are with the handcanon, as well as landIng precision kills
---
Well shit now I‚Äôve gotta try at least
---
New light player here how do I get it?
---
You literally don‚Äôt have to get headshots. There‚Äôs nothing they can do to not make this a skill ceiling killing broken mess of a gun. Mine sits in my vault and I simply don‚Äôt play pvp anymore purely because of this guns existence. If I want pvp I‚Äôll just go play siege or something else, and it‚Äôs basically entirely this guns fault. Getting headshots is the only skill in crucible take that away and I just don‚Äôt care anymore.
---
I‚Äôll add you on discord and steam!
---
However many you can earn no cap except because of time
---
True
---
There are no set bonuses
---
I get that but i think youre not seeing my point. As a veteran player, ive witnessed so many changes that i dont personally agree with. That being said its my opinion and not that of a community

I ended up getting suros regime from the engram and jade rabbit and I have ornaments for both of them

950 drops exotics a lot

Did you buy the invitation of the nine quest thingy? That's probably it.
---
 I currently am at 941 on my Hunter and Warlock and I have not played a single thing that requires lfg. I also have not done the 100k nightfall. 
---
Working with all your characters is the most optimal way to reach max power. Work one through all powerful drops then move highest weapons to an alt use the armor items fron the season pass or a vendor to get your armor up to light then do powerfuls on that one. If you have a third alt rinse and repeat. 
---
I'll work my titan up over the next fews days and should hit pretty close to the hard cap.
---
I'm a working dad as well so it's doable yoy just need to optimize the power drops and your time.

It's a weekly bounty from the drifter I believe, the one that rewards a synthesiser upgrade.

If they were a warlock and it was taken this morning I believe that was me.

Thanks!

Yea but from where do you get the essence. I know that the one one small step drops from Gaul

Yeah I'm just rocking one character atm so that's another part too it I spose..

Unfortunately the game is favoured towards more clan oriented Comms...doesn't really allow for solo Comms, something bungo should look into

Pretty sure there‚Äôs already been some youtube videos about it. It‚Äôll hopefully get nerfed soon lol

A distant, buck tooth cousin that keeps trying to tell Recluse how much it's grown. It's getting creepy
---
No one knows yet.
---
It seems netease is leaving Bungie alone for now though, at least looking at how Shadowkeep is looking. Will see how the next year of DLC's go, but from how y1 was, Activision and shareholders had a lot to do with certain game design decisions
---
Iron banner starts this tuesday. It's a competitive gamemode where your power level matters unlike other crucible matches.
---
Higher power level means more damage and vice versa.
---
It's pretty damn difficult. I could barely stay alive when I was 920 light while playing with LFG players. Too many mobs spawn, and they're honestly more annoying than the three bosses. You can attempt it solo and sit back and snipe the bosses (Not the mobs) which is the most common solo method, but I suggest finding some people to do it with.
---
I don‚Äôt understand, you can do everything except the raid solo.
---
??? The fuck i dont know what a benchmark would be. My point wad that hunters make up most of that. Anf its not just cause more people play as hinters. They arw just easier to kill in pvp
---
Gotta love those random death pits
---
I have video proof on my PlayStation soooooo
---
Basically, the game gets boring overtime, this is why i have 3 characters. Anyway, i don't wanna get rude, but ( on ps4 ) the destiny raid communities are full of kids and teenagers pretending knowing the raids mechanics...after a couple tries..."wait wait  let me check in youtube guys, something's wrong".
---
Nah that's cause everyone uses hunter. You're quite dense aren't you
---
I'm having the same issue. Everyone's having it, and there's no way to fix it right now. Bungie's looking into it though, so hopefully it'll be fixed soon so I can bag me that Izanagi's Burden.
---
You're not saying that to make yourself feel good. You're just trying to inflate your own ego
---
super easy.  Youtube has lots of videos, takes about 5 minutes to put the new one in.  Takes longer to back up your machine and reload it than to change out the harddrive.  Samsunge Evo 860 SSD is about $150 for a 1 TB drive on Amazon.

As someone who just started and is 905 power do I just keep doing weeklies to get higher? Also are exotics raid exclusive?

Or you could of easily just said. Half of my kills are hunters. It isnt stroking your abnormally large ego when you dont try to show whwt a big man you are with "6k" kills. And idk with you being this salty over it all i feel like youre giving your self too much credit

Sadly not me then.

---
No idea.
---
pretty sure the engrams don't need to be on Nessus. For the exotic there are ways to get it I think but just playing and killing as many big dudes as possible is probably fastest.
---
It is indeed much fun.
---
Hobgoblin "pally panic room" bubble? Lol
---
Cabal Phalanx? Lol
---
Taken Phalanx? Lol
---
Hydra spinny shield? Lol
---
Rof doesent change the amount of extra overshields they gain. Do you not understand how it works
---
You are Tarran?
---
Yup
---
you should be able to get to 950 without shadowkeep, and then from there Iron Banner will get you the pinnacle gear to get to 960 anything past that would be with the seasonal artifact which you get for free from the pass. so the only reason to get Shadowkeep is for the story, Shadowkeep weapons, the raid, and Vex Offensive.
---
It does tho, you have to be faster than the no longer extra overshield
---
Ok, assumed he was in your clan as you have the same clantag.
---
Yeah that can be said about any weapon that shoots its overshields. It isnt meant to turn them into a walking fortress its meant to absorb just a few more bullets
---
Dude it is 2100 glory. It isn‚Äôt that many matches at all. The wins can be done in normal crucible
---
What? If you engage a titan that got his full overshields from a previous fight rof doesent change shit. And literally any weapon can stop the gains in a bullet.
---
Then you have all the exotics that the engrams can drop
---
Yeah, I think that was a coincidence since my clan has about four people in it and I think I would have noticed if one of them was doing that
---
Exactly, so kill them dead, guardian
---
I've been playing since 2014 and still haven't got a 2 for 1 snipe yet.
---
I need more clanmates
---
'That's got to be the greatest company I've ever seen'

'So it would seem'

No

But how can i when they had the advantage because they were able to take 1 extra bullet and because of that i died
---
Very strange.  I had a bunch carryover from PS4 to PC.

It's the HM slave of destiny

Cuz you‚Äôre a hunter

What does that have to do with anything?

Fair enough, but I was just looking forward to the jacket. But yes I do, and I very well may buy it, it was more so that I was looking forward to the jacket and now I can‚Äôt get it even though I got the code.

---
Activision Blizzard being publicly traded while Steam being privately owned makes a HUGE difference.
---
I've been sad about the choices Activision (ATVI) has made and how they've disappointed us progressively more.
---
Bungie is smart. First the acquisition by Microsoft and the Halo series, then breaking off from that in a timely fashion, then partnering with Activision Blizzard and getting out of that in time too.
---
It's not surprising if you think about it. ATVI bought king games a year and a half ago? So clearly they wanted to push into mobile gaming. Diablo Immortal stunk like a heap of dead bodies. Then ATVI was "losing" important individuals.
---
If THAT is what we're seeing from the outside, let me tell you, internally life must have sucked. (I've watched several times as droves of people migrate away from a company when the internal culture gets like this.
---
Bungie stay strong!
---
I couldn't disagree more. I'm a Warlock and kill more hunters than anything because everyone likes the mobility in hunters. Screw mobility I'll kill you with my 12 mobility warlock and move on to the next kill lol
---
Equip kinetic and energy scouts, and focus on kills, then focus on medals in the crucible later. Thats what im doing.

I'm almost there with the quest for the bow, just need to go through  the shattered throne and kill the 3 "extra bosses" for the quest and recieve the bow from the statue :).

Flashbacks of waiting for taken public events in D1 for the champions
---
It's guaranteed, it's just a very short window. The "buff" you get is the cooldown; the reflect window is only for when you actually see the graphic in front of you, as far as I can tell. I died in the gfy here because that's just how it works with golden gun. If you were to reflect a Sleeper shot, it'd kill you but still reflect. 
---
You can do some really weird stuff with it, like [survive a striker in his super](https://gfycat.com/venerateddisfiguredcat). Just need that timing, or in my case, the desire to just keep going for it over and over because of how silly it is when it does actually work.
---
Its freelance
---
Just a heads up I'm 930 on all three characters playing ONLY solo other than strikes and the matchmade nightfalls. I have yet to go into crucible or Gambit for any weekly rewards. I play a couple hours max every day as I work and have kids. It's possible. Just a slower grind for sure. I love the new system this season so hit max really doesn't matter if you only play solo.

I had it done because I ran iron banner for the grenade launcher and armor.

I went and got thorn, last word and chaperon in one weekend of iron banner now I‚Äôm waiting for iron banner to finish mountain top too. Fighting lion will carry me through that I hope.

Play the solo queue.
---
You will face a lot of three-stacks in the regular mode, which makes it much harder. This, btw, was the reason why it felt hard last season as well: Lots of carries jumping in with accounts of low-levels to boost them up.

This season, solo queue, is quite nice.

Master of Arms is great, but I feel that it does not come in useful too often. Lots of good stuff can be made to work as well. Dynamic sway reduction for example ... not too shabby.

It's a really good SMG with feeding frenzy (Kill nets faster reload) and a unique damage perk called Master of Arms which gives a dmg buff to the Recluse anytime you kill something with a weapon.

It's a big deal cuz it's top tier for PvE and PvP but you have to do PvP to get it. It outperforms a lot of exotics and is generally busted right now.

---
Silly question, but if you don‚Äôt have the quest can you still obtain the weapon in Shadowkeep? I would need to somehow get the quest, if at all possible.
---
Not the case with EA and their Genderfield. Sales got hit, Dice head fired, stocks took a dump. Normies still listen to hardcore players opinion and if say the game sucks they won't buy it. And we all know woke types never buy the games they rave about online. I guess Bliz don't care if they lose US/Europe, they want to court Asia so bad because that's where MTX heaven is.
---
If you run the artifact that allows you to weaken enemies, Peregrine Greaves which boost your shoulder charge damage while in mid-air, one-two punch shotgun which gives a huge damage boost to your next melee if you hit all the pellets in your shotgun blast, and I think hammer strike, the solar shoulder charge, it does enough damage to kill 1/3 of the Master level Nightfall Boss

Forges are on a weekly rotation. Dont forget to shoot the 2 little servitor things before the 2nd battle and open the chest at the end of the boss battle that spawns.
---
You need to launch the GLoSC overlay you added to steam to enable the controller - it launches itself as a separate program, so if it's running you should be fine but if you close or restart your host computer then you'd have to relaunch it. You can also choose Destiny 2 as the source app for GLoSC and launch the game via that shortcut, bypassing the need for a dummy target, but it always gives me trouble when I use the native steam link app on my Samsung tv if I do it that way.

That's not a bug. That's comp. now
---
( "should i come back to d2 copy and paste. ")
---
Yes. Destiny 2 is amazing and in the best state a destiny game hss been in. I dare say its better than D1 at this point. There are more milestones/powerful gear than many players can do in a week ( multiplied by 3.) , 6 raids, gambit prime, tons of weapons from past seasons, tons of exotic quests and much more.
---
Forsaken fixed the year 1 content drought by dumping a ton of content, and each season since did nothing but help. Its seasons brought us forges where we can craft certain weapons, dungeons with amazing exotic quests to em, the menagerie which is basically a mini raid with matchmaking, and even a quest line about the drifter and the nine 
---
Now Shadowkeep is here and with it another HUGE dump of content, the return of eris morn and the moon patrol zone which is larger than ever, 3+ new strikes, new maps ( gambit &amp; crucible. ), EVEN MORE¬† weapons and exotics, as well as more story and such taking place after the death of ( Redacted. ) and eliminating the new red threat on the moon, and discovering one of the true enemies of the traveler, the ( REDACTED) Itself. 
---
A new armor system is here that lets you BUILD your perk set instead of praying to RNG. A new telic is here to help you level, perk out and get better
---
D2¬† couldn't be in much of a better place ( besides needing some minor crucible tweaks. )
---
Also, if you quit because of ( Mida multitool, Lunas/Not forgotten, Prometheus lense, etc.) Being VICIOUSLY busted/OP,GOOD NEWS EVERYONE, they've beem generously nerfed down to reasonable instead of busted. 
---
So all in all, coming from a D1 alpha/Beta player who has stuck to this franchise like cancer to radiation, i dont think the franchise has ever been better.¬† The only minor complaint is, whilst d2s raids are great, they are a bit more soft, unlike the brutal dark raids of D1 ( Kings Fall. ). But, don't worry, we are still slaughtering oryx's family, because all of them have a bad case of not knowing their place.¬† ( ehem. Under my boot. )

Also if you want to play the campaigns that are included with being a New Light player  go to the Tower and then look on the map scroll to the right as far as you will see the lone NPC over there. Click on her and then walk over to talk to her to get the campaigns. Start with the Red War.

That's actually pretty stupid lol

Hmm does the exotic engram from Xur count? He's in the Tower this week.

To hell with those spider bounties. They're not worth the wait. This was for Saturn Survivor, yeah? I wasted a damn hour of my night waiting. He never showed up. That and the jerkoff in the Gultch seemed to be bugged. Total no shows. Not worth the cores.

they go to benedict 99 and nothing shows up. I never did the nine quests and i was able to get the invitation

I‚Äôm having this issue too. I‚Äôve been stuck at 84%. Just had a 42 kill game and still at 84%.. not sure what to do
---
Weeklies are 12k XP, dailies are 6k XP refreshable are 4k XP , Ada and Werner bounties are 6k XP . Planetary were 6k and the fastest to do. These numbers are without the season pass bonuses. Saw a Paul Tassi post explaining this.
---
Woah I didn't know you could even get them back! I've been hoarding them like drugs.
---
Make sure to find people to play with. This game is designed around playing with friends. Depending on the system, I can invite you to my clan (80+ ACTIVE members on PS4), but get a group together. Story is great to give you an idea of what is going on, but once you hit 900, story missions won't increase your light. However, the other key to being 'better' is to get better gear which can be obtained through playing.
---
Sorry I meant Shadowkeep
---
Don't bother with the ones that have you "hunting" like you see here in the video. They'll have you waste hours. Just do the ones inside lost sectors.
---
Yep. And the one in the Gultch. Total no shows. Screw those bounties. Not bothering ever again.

This is wrong. You do not need Shadowkeep, just the season pass.

Absolutely ( before Shadowkeep )
---
Another thing to do is be in a fireteam for the shared wisdom buff on a planetary surface, it gives a lot more do when cashing in bounties
---
I miss them too

I was quite stubborn doing the MT triumph, but with that speed shotgun wouldn't matter with only 2 shots. Telesto though might have been a much better idea. I switched to it later in the match.
---
Lmfao.... 6million dead is equal to 25 cents....seems legit
---
Now that area 51 has passed WE RAID THE GREAT PYRAMIDS OF EGPYT
---
Do it !
---
Poor man's anarchy :D
---
Idk why someone downvoted you. Thats just literally ehat happened
---
Once you own a shader it can be reacquired at any time, you gotta play the ‚Äúdismantle game‚Äù for certain shaders in certain activities until you get access to the shader you want.
---
Do you have to wait for reset to get it?
---
Play the game
---
I've been using Tigersprite with Riskrunner forever now! On pc though. lol
---
Ra is the final boss... hes op af
---
I never made this about the 25 cents. I dont know why in the world you keep bringing that up. What i was complaining about is how absurd it is to charge 25 cents for a game at all, let alone one that is free. They dont make profit from those 25 cents. So why would they charge me 25 cents. And if youd have paid any atention at all youd habe realised that this is about them locking two thirds of the game behind a subscription service. If sou habe to pay 60‚Ç¨ a year to access 2/3 of the content of a free game, the game isnt free anymore.

Later we can eat at KFC
---
Haha.. Thats been my clan name for a while now...lol
---
its normal, you're supposed to play new light when you start up a new character
---
It will cycle around in the heroic story playlist and will give the same rewards.
---
Yes sir.
---
Odds are if it's an opulent mod, it'll only appear on oppulent gear of the same type. I.E menagerie mods or leviathan mods
---
Why in the world are you rolling around with 116 raid banners? And if you are never going to use stuff like rainmaker and such, just delete them. If you don't want to delete them, put them in the vault like the rest of us do.
---
But were can i play the red legion campaign
---
That was happening to everyone on our team during the raid lol. Every single death there was a corpse doing flips. Some of the Vex joined in too! XD
---
If you want to do red war you talk to Holliday
---
after new light
---
Make it an ARG: "Moon's Hunted"
---
They burn this boss because it‚Äôs more efficient for xp/glimmer/shells than waiting out the heroic version. The time invested in capturing him when he is frozen is not worth it.  So just blow him up and move on
---
Same just bought the jade rabbit I‚Äôm now working on getting it‚Äôs catalyst
---
Wrong travelers chosen and stubborn oak are currently 0 light
---
Is it just light now?
---
Oh so i have to reach the whole reach 770 light thing and such thats weird since it brings you to the new tower
---
If it works in Doom, it works here too.
---
I don't have to but I'm going to so when I get my bonus glory it will be over 2100. I got to 1982 then lost 3 straight games,won a game and got to 2074(that was a big oof) went on another 3 game losing streak. So I'm just waiting for the bonus points now before I'm outside of the glory bonus range to reach 2100.
---
you can do that with the sentinel super
---
I got it by doing a wish from the raid before that I didn‚Äôt complete but got a key and then my clan had a raid going and they needed a person for queens walk and got 1k on my first and only chest the other guy in the group said ‚ÄúYou have now ascended they are all peasants now to you‚Äù
---
Taxes? You mean you have to pay taxes?
---
TRIGGER DISCIPLINE!

I bet you missed, and that's why it ended when it did
---
Again, you are taking 2 random unrelated points from my argument and making wild illogical associations. Where have i even mentioned the 25 cents in context of this example? The  comparisson of ww2 was directed at your argument "noone is putting a gun to your head" cuz the same as with this situation, just because you are not forced to expose yourself to unfair conditions does not change the fact that these people are doing something that simply put is not fair. I dont know if your intellect is to small to comprehend these simple comparissons or whats the natter with you, but this is getting ridiculous

NO LFGING HERE. go to fireteam finder or whatever its called

9.5/10 Well done, very artful dismount
