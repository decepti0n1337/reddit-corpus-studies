Excuses are like buttholes.  Everyone has one and they all stink.

Good for purchasing Vex Milk /s
---
Where the fuck did any of that happen. You kept denying OPs facts. Plain as day
---
Thanks for the info, I'll probably go for recluse next.
---
Alright thanks!
---
Thanks for the tips.
---
&gt;was
---

---
*Indeed.*
---
Yeah it was a joke lol
---
There is no fact that doing this will work, it‚Äôs only speculation based off one line from a book about lies
---
Also I don‚Äôt know if you actually...read...but there‚Äôs plenty of people saying I said x when I didn‚Äôt, at least with one of them you can misinterpret it understandably but the rest are just fucking stupid
---
It‚Äôs as plain as a deluxe burger you fool
---
Time of day is important too.  I‚Äôm straight up trash at PvP (less than 1.0 KD) and I got to Fabled in an early afternoon session - @1-4pm.  From @500 points up to 2100.  Maybe got lucky, or maybe wasn‚Äôt matching all the kids who were still in school
---
It‚Äôs definitely the best invading super
---
All Snipers use special (green) ammo, except Heavy exotic snipers use heavy(purple) ammo
---
ok boomer
---
I mean yeah
---
It‚Äôs busted
---
I bought Destiny 1 and every single DLC at time of release, then I had to wait years before I got Destiny 2 for free I want some sort of compensation!

---
You cornered him and he felt unsafe. A natural reaction of our species.
---
I did the totems with crimson, raid sniper and wendigo.
---
Boss with tranquility, recluse and whisper.
---
The best tip for the totem part is just keep jumping and kill at least 1 knight quick.
---
I just bought Shadowkeep and Forsaken this week after joining up with New Light. 
---
Freaking love it so far, have an amazing clan that I play with all the time, ***SO MUCH FREAKING CONTENT OMG***. My quest log is brimming with story lines and exotic quests, I barely start any of them before Iron Banner or Festival of the Lost comes out. 
---
GODDAMNIT BUNGIE I CAN'T PLAY YOUR GAME BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY NEW THINGS TO PLAY IN YOUR GAME
---
But you don't grind/farm for primes. They're just random drops I thought?
---
1920x1080
---
Boomer and proud.
---
Hehe nice one
---
I bet it was.
---
My cousin introduced me to destiny1 way back when.  It wasnt long before I started sherpa'ing him and his friends (who became my friends) Now I'm pretty much the last one who plays it trying to do as much as I can solo.  Gotta say, something about the grind just keeps me going.
---
Are you referring to PvP?  Bungie does try to Nerf and buff guns to keep everything as viable as possible, but certain Pinnacle guns and exotics will generally rise above the rest
---
They said they would announce when it would go live. May be later in the day per that tweet.
---
awww the days of Auto Rifles destroying everything.  You know if you look at it the crucible gun meta really has followed D1 meta stroke for stroke over the years.
---
What happened?
---
Ok thank you
---
Got it
---
*trumpet noise*
---
I just hit 961 yesterday when someone make 999 XD
---
Hmm, very well, I acquiesce your point, at any rate, the core of the build, the anti-barrier rounds combined with breach refractor and Nezerec plus Recluse and whatever demolitionsist primary you want remains an extremely viable build. Wether you go for a heavy farming build or a debuff machine is really up to you, both routes are good and with the rest, guarenteed to cause some carnage üôÇ
---
I hope never. Crucible is already broken, don't wish it worse.
---
It really was. Especially because I could no-life that shit every day for the most part. I actually kind of credit D1 for saving my life. It was the most addictive thing I'd ever come into contact with, which says a lot.. it
---
saw me through the Darkness and brought me into the Light. (See what I did there?) Renewed my love of gaming, too!
---
Maybe he didn‚Äôt claim it once he made that new characer
---
Jade rabbit sparrow confirmed?
---
Whatever you want!  If you like story then go to Amanda Holliday in the hangar and do the Y1 story missions.  Otherwise you can really do whatever you like, Crucible for PvP, Strikes are like mini-dungeon/raids, and Gambit is a PvPvE game mode.
---
Everything you do will drop gear up to lvl 900 which at that point will allow you to start doing certain activities for "powerful" gear to level you up to 950.
---
It did come back it is called the arbalest now
---
I got Bygones, Trust, and 2 misfits in one day
---
I think that was extremely intentional
---
when you get the additional drops from crucible/gambit matches it drops at 750, same with pluperfect and the seasonal armor, its just pretty rare.
---
Quest idea: devrim wants to award you for your triumphs as a guardian, but wants to give you a final trial.  After completing the trial he gives you the sniper as a final ‚Äúgift‚Äù along with some tea.
---
what? mine have always counted for the quest
---
Found the jealous guy
---
New and original.
---
yeah but id stick to PvE activities because controller players have a huge disadvantage in PvP on PC
---
The Shadowkeep campaign quests of course, and some stuff from Ikora.
---
No its points , its combined for kills and medals. The easiest way by far is to use a fusion rifle and go for the cold fusion medal. These count as 1% , making you able to get 10% a match depending on your skill with fusion rifles.
---
So dont worry , its just very very poorly explained.
---
Every Titan knows the pain of seeing mimetic saviour armour entering your inventory.
---
I have one of each for utility, generally titan is my favorite although I mained a hunter in D1 and a lock. I still play all 3 each week for pinnacle and often start with my least favorite and move toward my most favorite-makes the end of the week grind more enjoyable
---
That's like every comp game ever xD
---
Amusing logic. Did it in the first hours after it was added to the game. First run to learn the mechanics, second run to get the emblem. 
---
Entertaining dungeon, but the Shattered Throne was a bit harder.
---
Scathelocke?
---
You purchase weapon frames from Ikora with them. But the frames only cost 10 each and you can only hold one at a time. And if you run Vex Offensive like, at all, you will be swimming in Vex Mind Components.
---
F
---
Yes?
---
Scourge of the past is a bit shorter of you ever feel like giving it another go.
---
Mine has moving target + rangefinder.
---
Even though Bagel didn‚Äôt get anything from the Shattered Throne solo, I‚Äôm not convinced that it didn‚Äôt trigger the start of something. Bungie‚Äôs congratulatory post today was suspicious. Of course on the surface there was the Savathun text and DMG‚Äôs twitter account getting Taken, but something in it stuck out to me. They called the 999 power entry ambiguous, but they didn‚Äôt call it a lie. The card itself stated that doing the 999 solo run would unlock the ‚Äútrue ending‚Äù, but nowhere did it say that true ending was breaking the curse as everyone would have hoped.
---
I think that Bagel‚Äôs solo run marked the start of some kind of ARG that will eventually link back in to the Dreaming City. Savathun called the lore card a trap, and we sprung it. I have a feeling that even if we don‚Äôt see them immediately, there will be repercussions.
---
The image was posted on Instagram without that caption and I added the caption
---
By who?
---
oath keeper just gives ever bow better rampage? even the exotic ones? really?
---
Right now i can't find the difference between casual and competitive
---
Also that is the exact caption I put on my post
---
Oh yuumi
---
I just got to 950 not including the artifact. Any tips on what to do?
---
"Powerful rewards" are all prime engrams, most are from weekly quests.
---
Can I have a link to the letter please? I haven‚Äôt hear anything about it
---
I checked braytech on the weekend after getting it, and less than 1% of the playerbase has done it.
---
 So yes it's quite an achievement
---
Well I guess everyone just wants to win since they queued for such a long time :/ but then again who doesn't wanna win
---
This comment lmao
---
I loved the destiny 2 campaign. I know it wasnt the fastest weekly story mission but I'd choose them from time to time to amaze myself how good the almighty missions were both graphically and gameplay wise.
---
My waiting times are like that too especially if I‚Äôm in a fireteam, but once I get into a game and don‚Äôt leave it seams to be ok.
---
This is awesome. 
---
Very well done.
---
StOp bEiNg aN AtTeNtIoN WhOrE- ok boomer
---
This looks awful familiar, like ive seen this image before...
---
‚ÄúCowabunga it is!‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs basically: the Hunter vanguard dares another hunter to be the vanguard if they die. 
---
So the hunter vanguard dared Cayde to step up if he died, and he died. Presumably, Cayde dared someone and that hunter now needs to step up to the plate. But it‚Äôs possible Cayde hadn‚Äôt dared anyone and they need to appoint them a different way.
---
Very nice, I haven't gotten the bad juju yet but I'm super stoked for it. Dont underestimate the utility of having a hard light with you btw, since day one I've found it a reliable companion.
---
Doesn't have to drop on Nessus for that quest. Can drop from anywhere else and it would still count. Just do random nightfall ordeals at 920 or higher or do other stuff. It's pure RNG based so you'll go crazy waiting for it to drop
---
Wait which cutscene is this from?
---
Low percentage does not imply difficulty. People just don't bother even trying it. Once they do, it takes 1-3 hours to be done. Low effort = worthless achievement. It's like bragging about triggering heroic events on the Tangled Shore.
---
Recluse? More like refuse to use actual skill.
---
Lol nice comeback bro. Your lack of creativity shows how much of a pathetic child you are. Thank you, I needed a good laugh.
---
Indeed, it took me 10 minutes to find a game. Another 3 minutes with black screen. I have the ps4 pro and the waiting times are awful.
---
I played iron banner last night and wrecked all the moons. Didn‚Äôt really see chats otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt be getting 2.8-2.8 efficiency every match.
---
You'll get it one day mate. The trick is to be good enough to not die ;)
---
Momentum has quickly become one of my favorite game modes... I love it.
---
Yes, I‚Äôve also found it to be good. Usually for higher level activities though I prefer Coldheart in that slot for orange or yellow bar enemies.
---
Try deleting destiny then restarting your ps then reinstalling it
---
Decryption can break your heart.
---
Took out Rihanna.
---
Wow really got me there, I'm gonna go cry into my custom baby seal leather boots
---
You should do lance Reddick
---
Is it a problem with steam not downloading the file all the way or?
---
Yea it‚Äôs good for sniper kills I got the Revoker in pretty much a day in momentum
---
now I know whose car to hit &gt;&gt;:)
---
Does anyone know the drop rate on the AoS catalyst because me and two friends all got it within the first week of Shadowkeep. Think we all got it from different activities. Assumed it had a higher drop chance or just highly coincidental.
---
Same, ive been playing like 10-15 hours a day... Im not even sure what it is about this game thats so addicting to me.
---
I'm on a similar boat, not for randy, but for recluse, 1190/2100 points. I can land a few kills here and there, but man.. if it aint the red team massacre-ing us, its one of our team going afk and/or quitting. PC platform, cant ask friends/clannies for help because they aren't on.
---
Sir this is a Wendy‚Äôs.
---
Probably doing the horrific ability kills bounty.
---
Imagine spending 6 HOURS on this one fucking bounty as a hunter and I'm only 70% done
---
Man, I didnt realize bright dust was harder to get now (stopped playing 3 weeks after black armory dropped), came back middle of last month and bought 4 of the 5 purchases for bright dust, now im mad at myself
---
Tbh i don't get why recluse with master of arms does nearly the same bodyshot as headshot damage
---
I dont think savathun was necessarily breaking the fourth wall, i think the normal text is a message from bungie and the text in brackets is a new lore tab from savathun, maybe the lore ‚Äútruth to power‚Äù was telling us to solo the  shattered throne not so we could break the curse on the dreaming city as it says, but maybe so we can break savathun out of a curse she was under, and soloing shattered throne was the ritual that brought about her freedom from that curse
---
It is bugged, Bungie addressed it on their twitter awhile ago
---
Man, playing a game recently with Zavala's voice actor as one of the main characters really helps me hear this, I love it
---
It‚Äôs bitter-sweet... I still remember the time I got my sins of the past and was so excited cause I could finally kill
---
im sorry i'll have a double barbecue cheeseburger and chips with a glass of water :(
---
Yea, it would pair nicely with the invis smoke bombs though
---
Apparently he‚Äôs been out of ammo for the past 2 years 
---
Learned that from doing the Eris FoTL quest
---
Why are booing him, he is right
---
They could always buff Graviton Forfeit to give you two smoke bombs.
---
Would you like to make that a large for an extra $1.89?
---
*Remember, switching to your pistol is always faster than reloading*
---
At least they've made it alot easier to gain glory than it used to be. 2100 used to be exclusively for God-tier players and above. 5000 was reserved for God himself
---

I mean I would give the max stat hitscan gun some range falloff at least when it can wipe a team and a half
---
"All you did was shoot the cup out of his hand..."
---
Its always up now. Shadowkeep update.
---
Ah a man of culture i see
---
Nice dude, really wish i could learn how to compose songs on that game. Would love to have each area themed around my fav. Gaming music
---
Should be a quest you pick up from Lord Shaxx, or you get it from playing 10 comp matches. I can't remember exactly how I got it but here are the requirements  https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/07/17/here-are-the-exact-quest-steps-for-destiny-2s-lunas-howl/amp/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjMuon199blAhVRnp4KHecxDjAQFjACegQICxAP&amp;usg=AOvVaw37cvl3d35Ps4vpKfJXwMTD&amp;ampcf=1&amp;cshid=1573089761494

There's a reason you haven't won a single match
---
Take that loadout into momentum controll
---
Thorn was also added this year in March
---
Sunbreaker collective ü§£
---
Wow. Brining ‚ÄúSunbreaker Titan‚Äù to a literal definition.
---
It should be silently added to devrim's loot pool, maybe give us his guns skin as an ornament
---
Now picture him saying it through a mouthful of crayons. ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ
---
While I love Shin Malphur (by far my favorite character we never meet and story in the game) his view and the vanguards don‚Äôt line up well. The Vanguard seem to be more defensive in the actions, only reaching out to attack and when it aids the defense of the city, where as Shin hunts down those who tempt the dark, and is very proactive and aggressive in his measures.
---
On top of this I‚Äôm not sure he classified as a hunter as he is from a time before the classes, much like the Drifter
---
Man I hoped that Ghaul was going to be the raid boss on the Almighty.
---
Once you hit 900 you'll be able to see the weekly Crucible, Gambit, Vanguard, and Flashpoint ones too.

I haven‚Äôt been able to play for like two weeks and I have too many things I need to get done in destiny &gt;:( it‚Äôs hard being a hardcore player when you‚Äôre so damn busy
---
Yeah boi it got smuggled in that fucking Engram.
---
Tbh that sounds like more work than just doing a full run
---
I don't think so. Death has passed us by this night sounds like ye old trick or treat, sounds like some reference to The Passover. The line about what kids say these days is just her being old.
---
It for sure still does. I was grinding out a few on EDZ the other day.
---
I was one of the few people who was lucky enough to actually have the "ignite the forge" quest and got Izanagi's Burden before the lastest bug! 
---
I published a tips post [here](
---
Does anyone have a link to the e-mail?
---
Me trying to grind randys with imperative.
---
You were scaring him titan punch when scared
---
I'm a New Light player and I've grinded beyond belief. Light level 960 Warlock and proud :)
---
I‚Äôm almost certain they don‚Äôt stack. I was just surprised to see a Well since Lunafaction got nerfed, because if I remember correctly, the Bubble‚Äôs damage buff is better than the Well‚Äôs.
---
Is this /r/whooosh material?
---
I do get the similarities of the ominous floating ghosts.
---
Eventually... lol for me it would be pre ordered the day it was released as public knowledge
---
Well no... as it‚Äôs a pc box, there‚Äôs a good chance that it‚Äôs just a download code inside of it. You‚Äôre not really gonna get a new box for a code. Plus I‚Äôm sure ‚Äúphysical‚Äù copies of D2 for ox aren‚Äôt that high, so it wouldn‚Äôt be cost effective to alter the box anyway.
---
Even if it doesn‚Äôt default to shadowkeep, I‚Äôm willing to bet that with proof of purchase bungie would just give the person SK.
---
Same. I never got Midnight Coup to drop for me, so I just saved up all my Leviathan tokens so I could buy one from Benedict when he sold it. I still use that handcannon. It's one of my favorites.
---
Thx uncle shaxxu
---
Yeah, I feel that.  Anybody clueless enough to buy this if it IS the base game, would hate themselves afterwards lol
---
You're only protected in the bubble and can't shoot out. Your damn near unkillable in a well and can shoot freely. It's best to put them side by side so you get the bigger damage buff from bubble while standing in the well to be safe from damage.
---
So Izanagi is still bugged during this new week?
---
Can confirm I saw this story as well. The Exotic perk on Jade Rabbit was originally the name of a scout in Destiny 1 that was gifted to a single player by Bungie after I believe his wife posted on Reddit about him loving Destiny and it being an amazing coping mechanism for him after brain surgery. I believe he had undergone the surgery for cancer or something. They made the gun just for him, and was later introduced as an exotic we all know as Jade Rabbit
---
Lmao
---
Well I mean, considering bungies first release without activision was well polished and genuinely good content through and through, yes you can.
---
Savath√ªn said bagel. It was all worth it.
---
You need to do the puzzles again
---
it's where one of the final story missions for the red war takes place. you only go there for 1 mission, but it's a pretty cool level.
---
Holy ^^shit
---
I just got mine earlier, you don't have to do comp to get it btw
---
Does Destiny 2 have recount yet?
---
So what? You get outplayed by Blink ya shotgun ape?
---
Queue has 5 letters. 1 out of 5 is 80%. 99% implies that there are 100 letters in the word.
---
Uh...ok ?
---
"Not bragging or anything"

*continues to brag*
---
Midnight coup (or Better devils) and the Batman scout rifle.
---
Can someone add in a Goku power up scream?
---
Gahahaha. Just saying that it feels good. Going against stacks suck.
---
Just putting this because I don‚Äôt know where else to put it, but I just unlocked arc battery but it‚Äôs not working for some reason when I dodge... it‚Äôs not giving me the overshield at all I get a little bit of health back but that‚Äôs because workhusk
---
I'm sorry. that was mean. I love you
---
Yeah
---
bye daddy
---
All melee back in my day. MAYBE a heavy rock if you‚Äôre a Titan.
---
Its nice to see Jared Leto found a new job after that Joker performance..
---
Life. What a bastard.
---
Happy cake day!
---
I would do comp, it and IB should could for 2% each win, but you most likely will face a lot of 6 stacks in IB
---
Anyone remember edge transit?
---
Me when I run the Garden World Nightfall with 340 kills and both my randos have &gt;100 each
---
I wouldn't like being on the receiving end of that but busted  it is not.
---
The lore never said something would happen immediately, just that it would set in action the events to the dreaming cities true end. Nothing has to happen instantly for that to come true
---
whos Uldrin?
---
Can‚Äôt wait for some mindbending fourth wall breaks in the near future
---
How dare you question the power of red
---
Last perdition slaps tho
---
I agree. I'm not really sure why it doesn't for either of them (solo and teams). They've probably explained it somewhere though.
---
Its gonna be dark dude telling ya
---
The one bad thing about Celestial Nighthawk is how unreasonably angry u get when I Whiff my super
---
For sure
---
I know your pain, almost everytime I play comp
---
Just failed no nut November just by looking at this post
---
That would be the part of the story I didn't know. Thank you for filling me in.
---
GL! Hope you get to use it before they nerf it into the ground. I try not to use it in PvP anymore but it's s god tier in PvE.
---
God please
---
It's weird it only seems to happen on my hunter.
---
This is how cayde feels back then...
---
You‚Äôd have a ball going against my clan. It‚Äôs nothing but shitposts for callouts &amp; meme strats lol
---
Doesn't the artifact bonus power levels, wipe for next season? So the player is technically just 950/952 like everyone else, but has a lot of bonus power levels.
---
From what I can understand, the artifact resets next season in about 2 months, and then we have to get those bonus levels again?
---
Not because youre a rabbit but because you are black
---
The main well after you kill the bosses on tier 3, once you see the prompt at the bottom, you should get an option to use it at the well
---
They do a bad job of acclimating new players tho. To start the main quest the red war you gotta go track down this vendor to get the quest, FAST TRAVEL TO THE QUEST then it starts. Plus, you start at 750 power level and have little tutorial outside of basic movement, so if you haven‚Äôt played the first destiny it might not make sense.
---
Rule 6
---
I swear on the Traveler, if I get another piece of the Tangled Web armour set, I will punch someone.
---
-&gt; of mice and man reference
---
I didn't expect one to pop up here.
---
lol. Sounds like a blast tbh. Of course, my body being blasted usually.
---
You have to get glory points which is comp, no?
---
Don't worry. I just lost against a 5-stack pretty pathetically as I posted this lol.
---
Hey, remember the scene in MIB 2 where J wants to let the aliens out of the locker and K just shows him theyre in locker?
---
What if Destiny is a game but real nevertheless and we're in a game?
---
Had some beers, then rode my bike to Best Buy for a midnight release that fateful night in September. That night was full of wonder
---
And its 1/2 of that for a single set of armor
---
Its the ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù on the far right
---
As someone who only played for a few months, this is how I remember it last.....what does it look like now?
---
Can confirm. Got all my wins this way. Only reason I got recluse was because I realized the wins portion of the triumph was already complete.
---
Wow, I started playing about a year ago, and I would not have kept playing if this is all the game was.
---
I just hopped back onto Destiny with the new update after leaving it at launch, I have TONS of bright dust and I hadn‚Äôt spent a dime on eververse. Also getting what you want for your silver is much better than an engram and hoping you get something remotely like what you want. Not everything is purchasable but if you don‚Äôt like it, just avoid it. There‚Äôs tons of content elsewhere in the game.
---
Alright. Thanks
---
No kidding. With all  the upvotes shit had me questioning what year it was and how old I am.
---
But I‚Äôm just trying to prove it‚Äôs not activision completely behind this bs and you just proved it for me thanks kind guardian
---
edit your comment and remove the ‚Äútime‚Äù from the url. wastedondestiny.com is correct
---
As someone who just recently got into destiny. I‚Äôve seen that recluse is basically top tier meta for all content atm and was wondering just how difficult reaching fabled in comp is?
---
Where do you redeem this?
---
For me, absolute hell the last 2 days.
---
If it ain't afk players and/or quitters, its the red team massacre-ing us 4-0.
---
Or put it another perspective: ever got depressed over a game before? This'll give you 2 stacks of it
---
1) this was a month ago. 2) literally across every quest step on all 3 characters you get a gun for said quest step as of last months ib due to new lights not having those guns necessarily. This ib as im waiting til thursday, they probably dont due too last ibs doing it
---
I am not a socialist or a communist. I dont work my job to so others can sit on their ass and get more benefits than me.
---
Me playing gambit in sudden death with blade barrage + shards
---
Real gamers use recluse and exit strategy simultaneously
---
Then you realize that you have to have dlc for every thing else lol
---
I wish we had DPS charts. D;
---
Not really but I'll look at the kids I have, Crimson is a tad slow so you go through a few waves to get two oebs at once so it usually builds up
---
Oh you mean a complete game that I didn‚Äôt pour 90 additional dollars into not even including D2 or eververst
---
What?
---
You can hear the cat purr when you sit/crouch next to it!
---
Wait until you run into a shotgun ape with 1200+ hours... :‚Äô)
---
 Saw a guy yesterday who's screen name was "Epstein mountain topped himself"
---
Nope, I always have bottom tree, I don't use top three at all, not even on pvp, I prefer mid three for that. But sometimes I do the shot at the head and it doesn't, mostly with hive ogres (I shoot at the eyes) and some cabal bosses
---
hey, don't knock the exit strategy til you try it.
---
I didn‚Äôt personally you them but I think they were actually recommended in PvE?
---
I'd say get the exotics now because you can always pull em from collections at higher level instead of infusing them.
---
Solar exotic heavy? Make it a tank weapon and instead of poison damage the pool could apply a debuff? 
---
Personally I just want swords to actually matter. Because its Impossible to get close enough with a sword to consider it a weapon you would run. Blocking needs to resist more damage and damage output needs to go up.
---
Hell I would love a boss like Crota where swords matter
---
I just got it too. I don't feel bad using it in PvP tho, not yet at least lol
---
Where in the app do I find that section? I'm only seeing tabs for my characters and my vault, none for the postmaster.
---
Every 5 tiers is a bright engram
---
I don‚Äôt agree just because it will break all animations
---
I‚Äôve seen this man! I got the idea for my name from him: (melee icon) me daddy
---
incoming 6 man ward of dawn no damage raid.
---
I always tell everyone "the best time to invade is when the enemy primeval loses health" and this is why sadly they never listen
---
I know but what about armor cause I get only helmet
---
Honestly if I get queues against the same 6 stack that just stomped me in IB again. I just instantly re-queue. I know it‚Äôs not cool, but I need too for my mental health.
---
If you exited the mission the Almighty was on your map so you could launch the mission again.
---
After almost a year of having it used on me, it feels nice to get some payback. I will say it does feel like playing with easy mode on.
---
If we are talking about Momentum Control then BEWARE OF SCOUTS
---
It's glory you need for it not valor but yeah it's pretty easy to get 2100 points. The medals are the tough part.
---
It is really incredibly interesting. I can‚Äôt wait to see what happens next.
---
Is it the Shadowkeep quest?  Go and makes sure your game and DLCs are all updated
---
I used to be like you, but everything changed when I realized raids were a thing like crota and VOG
---
:(

Yeah you definitely wanna get Randy's before this mode leaves. Trust me going for the 400 something kills in normal is hell. And who knows when they're bringing this back.
---
The only place to get Calus tokens is from 1 of the 3 Y1 raids.  All of the guns and armor drop from the raids, but you can buy them from the vendor after finishing certain raids each week.  The vendor can help you figure out missing gear pieces
---
Looks like eater of worlds to me
---
Wtf I can hear it üòÇüòÇ
---
Looks like I completed the bounty portion a long time ago (counting towards 17k+), but I only have 3% on kills lol
---
That would definitely be a paid Eververse purchase.
---
Now you get it
---
"Zavala Records" So that's what he did after his Vuvuzela career
---
Its the vanila game off of game pass
---
i honestly agree cause i love how swords work and feel but they just are sorta the worst heavy weapon
---
About a year late but gg.
---
Meh, stuff to do is overrated
---
Catalysts drop randomly from various game types.  You do not need to be carrying the gun for the specific catalyst your are looking for as it is all random.  Although you can carry it and be as superstitious as you like
---
Yes. You must complete the leviathan raid before you can earn daddy calus's tokens n cool shit
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who does this.
---
Idk what I was expecting commenting about Halo Lore on a Destiny thread, I was obviously gonna get downvoted lmao
---
Every time
---
Season pass... its an ornament
---
Is that a raid? I‚Äôve only had D2 for about a month and not nearly enough gear/friends for raids so I don‚Äôt know anything about them.
---
That's what I meant, glory (corrected it). If you win one you can lose up to 3 until you're back where you were before the win. Really wasn't that hard.
---
It‚Äôs Bungie.
---
It's on the inventory tab, at the top.
---
i still run it from time to time
---
Big feels bad when you're also the guy running divinity
---
Oh the new light quest?  That step is literally just get to 780, do strikes, crucible, etc.  Anything
---
whats the shader on the chest? looks awesome lol
---
that will be cool , combine it with nova boom + skull of dire ahamsadgh  , 1 heavy strike 1 nova boom !
---
Forty-four steel i believe
---
if they did that i would legit go to bungie hq and piss on them. not to be aggressive or anything, but, y'know.
---
I miss doing story stuff with Cayde..
---
Well Savathun did call herself the ‚Äútrue ending‚Äù
---
Oh, derp, it's lost items right? Wasn't called "postmaster" so it threw me lol, thanks for the info :)
---
Kick the purple ball into a circle where Salad Bin sets up. Green ball spawns. 
---
Kick green ball down stairs on the other side of Tess. Black ball spawns. 
---
Kick black ball up behind where it spawns, between the poles at the end of the path (to the right of the ‚Äúdo not pick this up‚Äù lava challenge). Blue ball spawns. 
---
Kick the blue ball into the middle of the cat walk between Zavala and Shaxx. Giant ball spawns. 
---
Have a friend bounce the giant ball on the ground where you spawn in (in from if Eva). Jump from the top platform in top of the giant ball, then jump right as you land on top of the giant ball. Watch the giant ball sky rocket 100m into the air. 
---
Emote and consider your life compete.
---
Ty :) good to know I don‚Äôt have to wait weeks to get the triumph done lol
---
Like multiple times a week?
---
Yeah she did.  Which worries me.
---
The cape is new monarchy succession
---
If I had a full auto smugglers if try it. The full auto on the AA is bouncy but easy to control. Just aim low and hold down a bit. Was owning someone with it, then kills me with one and sent me a message thanking me for showing him how OP it was lol. My sweaty loadout = 90 resilience, 40 recovery, Dust Rock Blues &amp; Anonymous Autumn.
---
lekker! thanks, coolest look ive seen in awhile
---
ArC wEb
---
It‚Äôs CHALICE YOU UNCULTURED SWINES.
---
maybe the lore ‚Äútruth to power‚Äù was telling us to solo the  shattered throne not so we could break the curse on the dreaming city as it says, but maybe so we can break savathun out of a curse she was under, and soloing shattered throne was the ritual that brought about her freedom from that curse
---
Sidearms basically
---
Ah so that the crayon can be stuffed in one of the holes, or broken up to fit in multiple. Can free up a fist so you can play and punch.
---
It was bound to happen
---
How come when I hover over the catalyst it shows a reload speed increase then?
---
Read my entire comment
---
Exactly. There have been 100's, if not 1000's of posts about it. I always google something first before posting here about it.
---
Masterrace
---
Bungle added a message to the website. Nothing happened in game.....
---
I mean it wasn't me that said it, but happy cake day either way.
---
For medals play with a 500ms charging fusion rifle. Will one shot people and you get a 150 point medal every time you kill 2 people in a life without changing weapon. Can easily get 600-1000 points a game.
---
Collections
---
It's kinda sad watching people in the comments of this post still hoping for something to happen as if the entire things wasn't a set up from the start.
---
Savathun got us all good ok.
---
You should be able to aquire them trough the Collections Tab.
---
But that's fun. I like fun.
---
holy shit i was literally just listening to master of puppets like 10 minutes ago, such a coincidence
---
Pvp is cancer, especially crucible. You either get one shot bashed, or run, slide and shotgun by a titan, or more often the opposing team spamming their power abilities.
---
Oh, it would be helpful if I read the op of the comment probably. But it originally said ‚Äú hey man, happy cake day‚Äù so I responded with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a girl, but thanks :D‚Äù
---
Lol :)
---
Jeez i feel so dumb for asking now, i completely forget you could do that. Since I've never done so.
---
100% best stat btw
---
But you do get gear in the bounties. It is a COMPETETIVE PVP event. Meaning the rewards are for those good at PVP. I'd say be happy that you can get that stuff at all and this isn't like other MMOS but then I would be a "try hard". It isn't like ffxiv which I play where you need 50 wins just for a mount or gear. Heck the best looking gear is only for the top 100 in a game that is immensely popular right now.  I consider myself far from good at pvp but even I was able to get the pursuit done on all 3 characters by the second iron banner. Did it in one evening of playing on my hunter.
---
3 was much better than 2 imo
---
You should have other starter quests as well. After one of those you will be send to Amanda I think. Then you can choose to play the old campaigns.
---
The thing with pvp is the more you do it the more you enjoy it. 
---
I have phases of doing pve only then i go back to crucible and im like yeah this is fun.
---
Main thing is to find a setup that works for you. If you dont have that you will never enjoy it, but making something work in pvp takes practice which some people don't take the time to develop.
---
I find having quests that need pvp give me a kick into the crucible when i need it.
---
I dunno, is that your part a meme, or does Shaxx just don't know how to write "you're"?
---
Aim for the head with scouts it‚Äôs a one shot kill to the head in momentum gonna be real ez
---
Is that master of puppets I hear? You have a great music taste guardian!
---
Lol I see this comment google claws of the wolf to see if I want it or not then first match of crucible of the day it drops.
---
People have good games and bad, But no need to bash them on Reddit about it. You could of at least blurred the names. 
---
How do you expect people to get better at pvp? Survival is nothing like quickplay, so the best way to get better is play the game mode that you have to get good at.
---
 Learn to carry people if you want to use solo queue or expect to lose a game sometimes. It happens and not everybody is going to be their best every game.
---
 Speaking as somebody who already reached legend this season and got not forgotten, I can tell you first hand that I had to carry people and got carried as well. It's team work that makes the dream work and sometimes you have to pick up the slack. 
---
Good luck on getting your recluse, but try to be a nicer teammate next time.
---
oh, yes of course!  
---
but you cant expect to get everything handed to you of which part you dont want to take part in.
---
so, in OPs example, he met someone who is not necessarily good at pvp or just had a bad day.  
---
so what, first of all, OP isnt what i consider a "all pvp hardcore entusiast either"

exMARKsthespot has actually 8 games in comp as of now, 8(!)
---
and OP really pulls of a shitpost? this isnt fortnite, not it is League. Posts like this are just trash. But maybe that's a console thing? the majority of pc players seem to be a bit more socially compatible (at least in destiny)
---
anyway, some weapons are gated behind certain activities. when i think back of when thorn was released, the wave of cry babies that went "but i hate playing pvp" was ridiculous. Destiny is a game that rewards you for playing pvp as well as pve, period. \*too lazy to get the shrug emoji\*
---
it's a part of the meme...
---
What's that middle left one with the pointed edges?
---
It's a pain in the ass, to be sure. 
---
But as has been said, go to the Hangar area in the Tower, find the Amanda Holliday character and get the Red War legacy campaign. Ignore everything else, just do that first. It will usually tell you where to go, and your map will have a big red map marker to click to run the next mission.
---
Wtf really

Hahaha yeah good shout ü§£

You seem optimistic

It‚Äôs a mini raid.

If you want to find a raid group try joining a mega clan discord

Going to try mine these week, any tip on the GL kills? ;-;
---
Ughhh ok mom and Did you just say good luck on getting the recluse lmaoo I got that shit a while back in 2 days and I don‚Äôt even use it and I obviously won that game I can carry but sometimes people just to heavy and break the damn bag and makes me end up losing my streak it‚Äôs painful and the post was just a little joke no need to get your panties in a twist
---
I‚Äôve been beginning to wonder if I should have gotten the seal title yet cause I‚Äôve played so much gambit I‚Äôm actually so sick of it. I need dreaded and the shell :(
---
To be fair I do use it sometimes when I'm running le monarque in my energy slot but it's no way near recluse.
---
I'd show her my Arc Staff.
---
Black Garden.
---
And you haven't passed the 2nd grade because you said your instead of you're.
---
I mean to each his own but you are honestly missing out on, in my opinion, the best content destiny has to offer as far as pve goes, I'm sure the people on the lfg sites asking for perfect loadouts and multiple clears are annoying but if you can find a team that is willing to help you get through the raids, I guarantee you will see the game in a new light and probably change your mind about exclusively playing solo.
---
Then which ones do?
---
Bro lmao did you not see how the guy was rapid firing a rocket launcher, this was definitely hax
---
Ignore the other dude's comment. The overgrown vex can be found around the moon randomly, but they mainly appear in events that happen after a public event is completed. They also appear in the raid Garden of Salvation and the 6 player activity called the Vex Offensive, both of which require Shadowkeep to play.
---
I'm still trying to get eek over and recluse, all I need for both is the glory
---
Dude, I‚Äôve got enough salt on my chips already.
---
This issue is getting crazy man, almost everyday I‚Äôll get 1 round of PVP with the hacker insta killing us the moment the game start with heavy ammo.
---
Its good for pve too and it helped me alot to get the whisper of the worm
---
I always,  get bad rep from those, i am almost giving up on you cryptarc
---
I accidentally opened a package earlier so only got the 1 bump feel like an idiot
---
That was great thank you for the laugh.
---
Just asking, bro. Still pretty new to the game.  Thanks for the heads up.
---
Yeah I use it in pve as that‚Äôs working with others but using it in pvp makes you kind of a sucky person imo
---
All good i wasn‚Äôt trying to be rude or anything i just found it really funny lmao
---
The ones that specifically say crucible bounty. If it says daily bounty or weekly bounty they don‚Äôt count for the quest step.
---
ok is shafowkeep worth the money? Because from what I have heard, its not that good.
---
For me it can't be a mod, because it is happening on Rose. So i guess it's a bug.
---
Nah I feel pretty good about using it, I also sleep very well at night knowing it's time in this meta world is limited so I make sure to use it as much as possible.
---
You either dunk on people with it or get dunked by it. No inbetween.
---
True, but i only use it in pvp for a smg questline. Useually i use sniper in pvp
---
I know for sure there's cats on Widows Court but haven't seen a bunny yet.

Ya, well... at least I tractored Riven!

All patrol zones are included in the free New Light content, so your statement is completely false.

 Seriously? It‚Äôs really good. You should do more of these. Be a bit more confident.

You can get to 950 without any DLC (and presumably higher if you do Iron Banner for pinnacles)

Why does that dude look like the Nightcore Version of a My Chemical Romance song?

Thank you

They are literal thorns.

This ^
---
D1 shader system was best
---
both, i play regular and then do the prime bounties to push my infamy rank up so i can get the ghost shell on my third reset.
---
Wow, these are amazing my dude! At first, I thought these were copy-pasted.
---
Toilet seat?
---
Thanks for the tip, I will be sure to do that next time this happens. Was a bit salty when I posted this last night
---
These are great!
---
You can have it in your vault and it still counts completed bounties on the catalyst. Pretty easy to complete a catalyst if you don't even need the weapon in your inventory or equipped to progress it.
---
Well the general gist of where they came from is they were transdimemsional sentient software, existing without a medium for the longest time. They were born from the end of the last "cycle" of another branch of reality in the Destiny multiverse, and invaded this one to survive, settling into ancient saltwater comets near the dawn of time and manipulating quantum mechanics to encode themselves into the radiolarian lifeforms we all know and love. When exactly they built their robotic frames and left their adopted homeworlds we don't know, but when they did, they basically became everywhere, everywhen at once, since their gate-space travel tech lets them completely sidestep linear time and traditional causality. However, they're constantly at war with higher transdimemsional forces they don't understand, namely the Light and Darkness, the entities that created this and all other universes.
---
*tire screech*
---
I will try after the hotfix, thanks !
---
Don‚Äôt talk to me or my ghost again
---
It's not a tough quest. I literally got the Recluse in 2h.
---
It's from forsaken. The dreaming city is cursed and the curse is at its strongest every 3 weeks. In the last wish raid, there's a wall of wishes where you can wish for a bunch of different things within the raid itself, like skipping encounters, giving people funny heads, spawning eggs, etc. 14 wishes have been discovered, but there are a total of 15. Since forsaken is over a year old, you can see why the fanbase is going crazy over this lol.
---
Queue up a match and then leave and you‚Äôll get the triumph
---
Log out and back in.  Go to the tower and then back to orbit.     For some reason this triumph has always been buggy of sorts.  You just gotta do stuff to trigger it.
---
Icebreaker and Gally will never return. Bungie didn't like that the community added an extra entrance barrier to endgame content to new players by vets demanding in their LFGs that those weapons be required.
---
Also the amount of butthurt people had by not having them was enormous. But one could argue that was due to my first point.
---
The Dreaming City curse. In Forsaken, after players killed Riven, the Last Wish raid boss, a three week curse started on the Dreaming City, where each week, the City would get infected by Taken energy. Every third week, players could enter Mara's throne world to kill Dul Incaru, Savathun's daughter.
---
There's an entry in the Truth to Power lore book that says that, to unlock the true ending of the Dreaming City, someone has to reach power level 999 and defeat Dul Incaru by themselves. We thought this would break the curse or something, but we were tricked by Savathun into making her more powerful the whole time.
---
Hahahahhahahah
---
I usually go to the moon, pick all bounties from Eris, complete, turn in, repeat. This I feel personally has been working great
---
A super that isn't actually a super? Don't let the hunter use it.
---
Ohhh that curse sorry when you said curse I thought there was some new one I didn‚Äôt know about and hmmm okay I remember the wishes didn‚Äôt know the last one wasn‚Äôt found that‚Äôs crazy cool
---
Curse on the dreaming city. Three week cycle in which the city gets more and more corrupted by taken.
---
If you want to see what happens when you let Bungie set the timetable, look no further than Halo 2.  It was almost a year behind schedule, and one of the greatest games ever made. Microsoft was wise to give them the time they needed. Activision wanted immediate return on investment instead of allowing Bungie to create a work of art.
---
Itll just be down to luck honestly.
---
imagine being this horny.
---
Just checked it, I meant KackisHD's Video.
---
I just like to use three bows with the exotic hunter gloves, what ever they are called. Would like to have a legendary heavy bow though, I quite like lemonade in the energy slot.
---
I use Polaris lance üòé
---
*insert joke about momentum control*
---
That is a good way of ranking up. Also, if you run strikes pick up the planetary vendor bounties, along with Driftor and Ada-1 bounties that involve defeating opponents anywhere in the solar system. I tend to get these done in the background passively without thinking about them and later will clean up my directory by going for specific ones if they aren't completed. Crucible matches seem to net a decent amount of xp as well even without bounties. I play solo a lot too, so it can seem like a chug, but I'm at rank 83 or so and it climbs pretty steady once you get a system down.
---
A background similar to the scenery of the first mission in D1 or new light since that‚Äôs where the quote comes from
---
thanks for the answer! follow up question :-D
---
should i only keep epics and exotics right?
---
and where do i find out what rolls are needed? i guess stats depend on pve and pvp, but is there any guideline what to use for what?
---
can i get any moon weapon without shadowkeep? I want Every Waking Moment specifically..
---
Thats the glorious thing we call rng
---
Yeah it's super cool, the community's been at it for a while
---
Ah ok. I wasn‚Äôt sure the exact number so I‚Äôll go w yours then
---
920s don't reward exotics that often, do the 950s at least. and prime attunement doesn't guarantee an exotic just because you are fighting tough enemies or whatever, whether its a standard prime engram or an exotic is pure rng.
---
Like wardcliff, but knives!
---
I really should invest some time in finding a fireteam and playing this more
---
What's your loadout look like for the 920 nightfalls?
---
*Insert champion barrier breaking sound effect here*
---
yea, but reaching 999 is ambition, passion even.
---
"I cannot run shattered throne solo, never even done it with a group"
---
And this guy is farming xp like an asian gold farmer? not buying that
---
Yeah there isnt anything new in my quests log. Thanks anyway
---
Middle tree voidwalker can send you to the Nine via melee
---
There isn‚Äôt anything in my postmaster
---
Yeah I‚Äôve definitely seen this here before...
---
For real. It's insane how much if a pos these people can be over the dumbest shit possible.
---
Vex offensive is available to anyone with the season pass. Whilst it is true that if you have not spent money on the game you cant access it you absolutely do not need shadowkeep only the season pass.
---
Changing chars did it for me.
---
You can‚Äôt reset your Glory.
---
KONO DIO DA!!
---
I am really tired of getting 1 shot cause a titan hugged a corner and tapped melee. My veteran friend keeps telling me warlock and hunter melees can also one shot but I havent seen it.
---
I haven't bought shadowkeep yet and I can do the first mission and patrol on the Moon.
---
Ah, I've come to that conclusion after watching Byf's video. I might have misunderstood it then
---
Hezen, precursor, Sol collective, descendant, taken, Sol divisive.
---
&gt;it‚Äôs not a tough quest
---
...in your opinion. 100 wins and fabled in comp isnt as easy for everyone. But I‚Äôm glad you feel good up on your high horse. 
---
&gt; You can't put a wall to a meta gun.
---
What does this even mean?
---
That worked that‚Äôs for the help
---
I just got recluse last night and it only took my a bit over 2 hours go from 0 to 2100 in glory. I haven‚Äôt even used it yet cause I went straight to bed after getting it but I‚Äôm happy I finally got it.
---
You‚Äôre welcome!
---
Alright. You got a laugh from me.
---
Vex donut
---
These lool great
---
I just love that he waited until I motioned with my hand
---
Once you get it once it should be added to the possible iron banner rewards for completing a match or from turning in tokens so getting another shpuldnt be too hard
---
It‚Äôs one per character per day. I knocked out 5 of them yesterday and turned them all in on hunter.
---
Well you must be doing something, then. Because it does not take that short an amount of time to fully draw Leviathan's.
---
*Gary
---
Be polite. Be efficient. Have a plan to meme everyone you meet.
---
Me too. I suck, but me too.
---
You‚Äôre the one who said it. Not me. Pretty defensive for an innocent person. An innocent person wouldn‚Äôt have covered their name, IMO.
---
Hmmmm :/ is this a trap I sense?
---
God. I would've bursted out laughing if I saw that name.
---
I actually caught myself yelling ‚Äúslap bitch‚Äù every time I dropped a titan like a rag doll in momentum last night as a warlock. I‚Äôm not ashamed to admit that it was satisfying.
---
Cries in sniper/shotgun/Erentil/MT/recluse
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a good point, but that‚Äôs more DPS than anything
---
People claiming Cold Fusion gives more points, it's just because you statistically need more kills to come over a chance at Cold Fusion, opponents are not sitting ducks, each defeat +1. While with a combination you are better with, you can farm much much more medals in a single match. I am more of a backline support player, so you can see I choose those that do not require final blows mostly.
---
Mmm. Nice.
---
No offense but I hope you stub your toe everyday for a year
---
*pulls out machine gun* √ôw√ö
---
Millions of players, it's a really good game
---
Awesome. Hopefully there will be a career available to you that will allow you to create Destiny quizzes all day. Good luck.
---
Nyoepd
---
He also said you can ‚Äúliterally get the gun in 8 wins‚Äù which is 100% false. Facts matter.
---
What are those two from?
---
That's the tenth different misspelling I've seen now. Can we go for a dozen!
---
??
---
No blueberries are just randoms. I wasn‚Äôt paying attention to what they were using since I myself was unstoppable as a hunter, just like my teammate and my third who‚Äôs a tether baby
---
‚ÄúIma wear all my piercings so they can get slapped outta my flesh‚Äù

Downvoted for noobtube.

Shaxx's Left Nut
---
There's gotta be a good shader to make you look like Starscream
---
That's savathun's plan: to delete the game from our hard drives
---
100 wins is just playing crucible normally in any gamemode. I reached Fabled in seven matches from zero glory with only 30h on all the crucible. Yes, it's very easy.
---
Your subjective perception of the amount of recluse or shotguns has nothing to do with the real amount nor the balance of a gun, but if you are to play that game, Recluse is the second most used comp gun (Source: DestinyDB), which is over the most used shotgun (Dust Rock Blues).
---
PvP games main focus should be in skill not in getting the right gear. If having better gear gave so much advantage why would you try to get better at the game if the skill gap is so compressed?
---
Do you have to make 10 posts about this? A hotfix is coming out on reset, just be patient until then
---
is it eververse engrams? or nostalgic?
---
no, exo do not require sleep
---
Not after the dragon fly nerf. It takes like 3 seconds to explode. In that time you can already kill the remaining enemies.
---
The what now?
---
So then there's basically no point to grinding out hard. Each season lasts ~1.5 months IIRC and it'll take damn near the entire season (heavily grinding) to hit 980ish. A few friends have been grinding damn near nonstop, hell, there's Bagle, hes been grinding nonstop all day every day and he just hit 999. 
---
If the artifact resets back to 0 on the new season,  then there's basically no point of grinding past +15/20 bonus
---
I used Heavy with proxymity nades to get the multikills, did this step in about a day in momentum control.
---
Just keep camping and getting that heavy node and at some point someone will group up enough.
---
You have 4 shots, 2 if you pick it up from the ground. Fire them wisely.
---
Wtf this happend to me yesterday but during gambit...this is why I love destiny

It wasnt very good at launch then it had a HUGE comeback with release of forsaken

No. Didnt say that was requirement but I guess I'll try that
---
If I like pvp what class should I pick.
---
Autocorrect.exe has stopped working.
---
And the pocket supernova or whatever it's called is like a backup Fusion Rifle with horizontal spread you have access to every minute or so, but damn does Nova Warp suck as a Super.
---
Awesome
---
If you go to the seasons page on the director, there's a countdown
---
Still genuinely mad about that.
---
In 33 days
---
I went with Jade Rabbit, Orewing's maul with proximity nades and PotG with proximity nades.
---
Jade rabbit can deal with snipers, Orewing's can get the kills part done quite easily and PotG is for multikills. Worked well enough to me, and I am really bad on PvP
---
I‚Äôll try but I doubt it will have an impact, anyways I would not want to scrap my titan because I literally can‚Äôt get exotics
---
Congrats bro, I just got my recluse so I definitely know how good it feels to get these weapons. Is it worth going for lunas after I hit 2100, I think I would have to start fresh from the beginning of the quest?
---
"warlock thing"
---
Thanks üòÅ
---
Did you reset the artifact?  You lose the mods when you reset it
---
You used up your RNG for the year
---
Switch to a pulse rifle and see how many final blows you get. I got most kills on my team when I could use loadouts I wanted. Now I‚Äôm 955 and it seems much easier.
---
I somehow forgot to say congrats to you in my last post. Congrats!
---
I have my mobility up to 100 as a hunter with stompees, this would be fun to try as well
---

Donut vex looking like an Xbox 360

There was no mention of that
---
Holy, thank you

they spawn in the vex offensive and in the garden of salvation raid. they are the "Sol Divisive" aka the religious cousins of the main network
---
You mean to inform us he‚Äôs been up there for two years and just aiming yelling pew pew, no ghost, and an all around good attitude?! Forget it guns his hands down.
---
A bubble Titan with a Monte Carlo can perpetually keep Defensive Strike procced and still use whatever exotic armor they want in PvE, though I don't know why you wouldn't use Synthoceps in that case for the range increase and Biotic Enhancements buff on top of the Defensive Strike buff when surrounded for perpetual healing as you OHKO everything with melee.
---
And your allies also get the healing and overshields in that case, too.
---
Aint as complex as wow. I got to power level 950+ and still have no clue...what I am doing. Just run through bunch of stuff don't turn in tokens earlier and then make different class character and level boost it by transferring high level gear to it.
---
Besides raids doesn't look like anything will be very complex. Definitely not wow. But I like it
---
Nice! just solo‚Äôd the recluse quest after a few hours myself, the changes have made it so much easier for solo players
---
Fakebringer, as in Imago loop, the D1 gun from strike loot.
---
Just put it on a swivel so we can spin it around if needed.
---
Shadow Shot + Dodge around the corner with invis, charge, jump back around corner, tag one enemy that isn't behind cover... kill everyone that's tethered. It's always a thing of beauty.
---
What exactly is happening?
---
Descendant vex
---
Not old...you're just a "seasoned veteran"
---
I did.  I had 0% completed after I got my recluse and to be honest, really underestimated how long the hand cannon kills and then handcannon precision kills would take.  I did most of both using crimson with the catalyst.  A few maps that were a but bigger I'd use Ace sometimes as well.
---
Claimed! Thank you!
---
The start of every joke.
---
Did you forget the Taken and the Hive exist?

I bet you also like playing on a TV.

Creating new enemies requires creating new stories about them.
---
Current races already have stories that can be developed. The only thing that I think could become a new race is the darkness itself but I think some gameplay semantics may be weird to work around.
---
Yo how about some custom ones
---
Dawning warmth best shader
---
What is this comment?
---
Same for me, this season 3v3 survival allowed me to get recluse in just 2 days. Last season I went up and down ranks for 2 weeks before I gave up.
---
I was consistently getting 20 to 30 kills every match and my team would still lose. Shit was soul sucking. I went from 1500 glory to 800 in one night. Just couldn't do it anymore.
---
I'm Ants in My Eyes Johnson here at Ants in My Eyes Johnson's Electronics! I mean, there's so many ants in my eyes! And there's so many TVs! Microwaves! Radios, I think! I can't, I'm not 100 percent sure what we have here in stock, because I can't see anything!
---
I‚Äôm a Titan-only player and even I hate the OEM T-baggers. Its top tree arc and Synthoceps for me. I use arc for the lightning grenades plus it always feels nice to slam that super on a shotgun ape or triple down on a cap point. The shoulder charge is a nice bonus.
---
Also curious
---
thats the problem with f2p games\^\^
---
also you can get destiny 2 hacks for free ( at least a free trial )
---
sucks for us legit players :(
---
Man I had to study for midterms yesterday but instead I played a bunch of competitive and got two exotics, so I‚Äôve got that going for me I guess
---
Get your braytech werewolf!  Instant LL boost.
---
Just the bounties are Pinnacle.
---
Also, the update just happened. You can do Pinnacles now.
---
Only from the bounties.. but it is worth to trade in the tokens because the engrams reward enhanced mods
---
1k voices looks cool as hell but raids spook me and i have no friends
---
Good stuff, i work in photoshop and what I think you should do is do a reverse radial gradients for the background instead of plain grey. Then get pictures of warlocks doing badass moves and filter gallery them
---
Better than that ‚Äúgiant head crest‚Äù we got on the raid armor.
---
Also happened to me after I reset it on pc
---
No it's just an emote. Both players will lock swords for a few moments struggling before the push back
---
Surprisingly, a lot of the cool stuff isn‚Äôt earned through the store, but endgame content like raids. 
---
And you‚Äôre talking about THIS season‚Äôs cosmetics, not the 7 seasons before it.
---
I managed to get Delirium the other day, it shreds! Great MG. Happy Hunting
---
Sure seems like that would work, although wendigo is only really good in group stuff because of all the orb generation, I think 150rpm spike grenade launchers are better if you can't activate the unique wendigo buff consistently.
---
I dunno, I saw a face on your chest and now I can‚Äôt unsee your entire upper body as one big samurai helmet.
---
I don‚Äôt know how, but you used the wrong formula and got the right answer.
---
I inserted the key with no issue. I'm Completing my rare bounty now, so not sure about the obsidian crystal part.
---
Lol I‚Äôm too scared to progress it
---
All loot is based on your max light gear score.  Max light gear score is the average (rounded down) of your highest equip able pieces for each slot.  You do not have to have the equipment on for it count, but it does have to be either in that character's inventory or in your vault, not on another character.
---
You have soft cap (900), hard cap (950) and max light (960). 
---
Before soft cap all drops will be at light level or above (even blues).  
---
From soft cap to hard cap (900-950) you will have to get power engrams, primes, and pinnacles to get higher gear. Everything else (blues and legendaries) will drop below max light.
---
From hard cap to max light (950-960) only pinnacles will drop higher than max light (just changed to +2 today).  Primes/power engrams will now drop based on your rounded average light (not rounded down, just regular rounding rules).  So if you have 4 951 pinnacle pieces equipped, power engrams can drop at 951 instead of 950.  Your average light if you have 4 950s and 4 951s equipped is 950.5.  Your max light is 950, but power/primes will drop at 951.
---
As for raids and other non-match made activities you should join a clan or LFG a fire team.
---
1k ornament?? How do you get it?
---
Woo seems like it‚Äôs fixed then
---
Just recently got an Arsenic with Rampage and moving target.. I freaking love it. Haven't tried it in pvp but I might try it now
---
He went all Dikembe Mutombo. Not in my house!
---
Just lfg. That's what I did to get it. Most people can carry you through it by now.
---
Alrighty then, that's exactly what it is. Your opinion.
---
I inserted my key into the  mysterious box before I read that the quest was bugged again and it disappeared. I just logged on and my mysterious box was unlocked. It‚Äôs fixed! Now I need a rare bounty.
---
I match made with 2 random people and we got 106k points without even going for it. It's more than possible if you have levis breath and 2 anti barrier weapons. Overload isn't needed this week.
---
It‚Äôs not a real gun, that‚Äôs what I mean.
---
Okay, 
---
I‚Äôll just take my bubble over here then
---
I wonder if it gives you more based on your +power bonus?  Someone posted that they had more also.
---
So basically Savathun is Aizen from the Bleach series. "Your entire existence was part of my plan."
---
Just hit 1000 crucible kills with my Arsenic. Don't plan on changing anything soon
---
I thought this was normal
---
doesnt work for me. NO KEY MOLD STILL.
---
Read many different posts saying the keys work now. Problems I've seen are keys not deleting from pursuits if they were automatically used in the patch and ada is not giving the key mold if you already had one.

I‚Äôve read it‚Äôs one per acc not character or something like that

Politics spread in subs like this because r/politics is very biased and a hive mind and other political subs are just an echo chamber that rarely get actually political discussions going.

Categorizing quests as OP suggests would be a good start. Although I wouldn't go with filters only, have it actually broken out into a row for weapon quests, another for campaign quests, another row or section for "key items" like the menagerie chalice or mote oven-thing and anything that gets consumed direct, and so on.

Two people stay on nearest point, the other 4 push B to try to win the first engagement and get the first cap on center. This is a very simple concept. All 6 of you sitting on the first easily capable zone is idiotic.

I think spinny hammer men are adorable. They look like they are having fun

So you are stuck on the pvp part?
---
Exactly this! How crazy would it get then? They could branch the game into factions like WOW and have neutral pve areas where pvp was enabled. Things would get nuts! Bring it on!
---
You‚Äôre doing something wrong. Almost everyone gets this on the second try: you fail at the final three-guy wave, learn what to do, and then do it right next time. 
---
I mean, seriously: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm struggling to be good at a game‚Äù is not ‚Äúthe game is poorly made.‚Äù
---
ngl this was the prettiest slap i've ever seen
---
You just want all guns handed to you or what? Its not even a hard quest, sounds like your aim is shit. Not sure how thats a game design issue sounds like your skill is the issue
---
I really hope it is
---
Hold them for a couple of days so you can turn in 8-10 at one time.  That is the only way I have ever gotten one.  My husband seems to get them every time he completes a forge.  Bungie obviously likes him better.
---
And yet they are more qualified than you.
---
Ive been play titan for 6 years and hate OEM as much as the next guy. But you do know every class has annoying things to.
---
Dreg dropped me tractor cannon
---
If you want to see more of my stuff check out r/lasrig and send me a message if you want to commission something.
---
Indoctrinated, I suppose, but it mutually evolves.  Nothing is free... at least this game gives you a two-way payment system to gain cosmetics; from silver and glimmer on rotation.  I personally love using my playtime to gain looks rather than having to use my wallet.  I find this to be the best system, yet.  For my money to personally be tight and therefor not spend any USD other than on expansions, but have almost every single cosmetic the game has to offer?  Yeah, i'd say they're doing something right.
---
This man gets it
---
Do you know when the change? Or how to find out what forges is next ?
---
I agree, people don't seem to understand how important this is in Iron Banner. Each kill you get is multiplied by the zones you have. If you have all 3 zones and you kill an enemy that counts as 3 points. When the enemy captures all 3 zones don't go engage them find a place to hide because you're just going to feed them kills. Even when you trade kills you get 1 point they get 3. Find a zone and sit there until the time runs out or run away, use your super defensively if you have to.
---
Edit- And always make Shaxx proud! " You're alive guardian.  Fight like it! "
---
Just 2 days ago in IB, we met a dude who lags like mad and running around 1-shotting everyone with thunder coil striker. He could melee you just outside of shotgun range. It's insane.
---
Escanor vs Galland? Seems about right
---
I guess you could say its our Destiny
---
Very nice
---
My bad I meant the Daily Heroic, it‚Äôs on the vanguard strike screen. 
---
There‚Äôs also that Nightfall that doesn‚Äôt require matchmaking but it‚Äôs only 820 light.
---
See! That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm complaining about, I get the Devs wanted to make it challenging as well as fun, but for people like me we‚Äôll never see those weapons or the ends of those quests. Just waiting around for the next DLC so we can have more stories.
---
The issue is with obtaining the key mold. Some players get it and some just dont. it has been this way for the last week but i guess we didnt hear much about it because people didnt want to complete it anyways.. because of the other issues.... but now everything wants to do the quest again.. and some just are not receiving it.
---
Levianthan's Breath only requires the season pass :) I have it and I don't have Shadowkeep.
---
i found that room last night
---
When the worlds collide
---
I think it's happened in many games.
---
It's a year one weapon so it's got static perks. Comes with rapid-fire frame, full choke/rifled barrel/smoothbore, flared magwell/steady rounds/accursed rounds, and rampage
---
For any of you solo loving players on here that are on Xbox, my gamer tag is brotary if you ever want to run some just for fun, not super competitive, not trying to put out video content, not live streaming, raids or matches.
---
Ah, the good ole days of self rezing warlocks.
---
I used OEM for a while but after growing frustrated from other people using I decided to change things up so I wouldn‚Äôt start crutching on an armor piece that will eventually be gutted.
---
...I did see it. And I did the rare bounty while the black armory key was glitched. Perfect window. You sound irritated, need a hug?

This, everyone hits a wall at some point but the determining factor is your willingness to keep trying and learn what it is you're doing wrong...or what your fireteam is doing wrong.
---
I know it sucks, took me about 20 times however after you practice you will get it. I didn‚Äôt think I was going to be able either.
---
I deleted all mine and had them all so you‚Äôre safe dude
---
"You just want all guns handed to you or what?" After being on the last step of the quest..... I'm not saying the quest is hard or that they need to change it, but I wish people would stop saying this dumb statement/question every time someone criticizes a quest. Literally no one has asked for guns to be handed to them.
---
And also, I can't *feel* anything either. Did I mention that? But that's not as catchy as having ants in your eyes.
---
I used it for a little bit as well. Tbh, it wasn't really fun.
---
I need this as a hunter
---
What gun was the last gun you pulled out
---
7 all armor is a random drop/ bought from xur. The only exceptions are worm related ones from the warmind campaign, complete it on each class to get those exotics.
---
Titan has one eyed mask, which is getting nerfed soon thank god. Besides that maybe insurmountable skullfort (titan main here, we got shafted with lame exotics besides one eyed mask being broken)
---
Hunters have wormhusk crown (get it from the warmind campaign) currently busted with mod combinations. (Mainly in PVP tho) Stomp-ee5 and frost-ee5 are good too for neutral game. Celestial nighthawk is back and still amazing for golden gun, and shards of galanor are good as well
---
Warlocks have ophideon aspect and Luna faction boots as the main exotics to get
---
Download reddit app on phone it will make your life easier
---
Currently for hunter and pve. Liars Handshake is amazing for arc builds. Throw in a 1-2 punch shotgun and a mod from an artifact and your hunter turns in to a punching and dodging murder machine
---
Titan thing too?
---
thx
---
From the annoying amount of Grenade launchers in the momentum playlist I‚Äôm assuming a ton of people are finishing up on that quest.
---
Arguably best pvp exotic for neutral game.
---
The Colony, momentum, hog the heavy, wait till you see a bunch capping, winner winner chicken dinner.

Yes I've been using it all day, you are probably having connectivity issues due to bad signal or wifi
---
8 my daily playtime is raiding cuz i have a dedicated team who kick ass and take names, but besides that I‚Äôll play crucible and work towards Titles. Titles are the main reason i play the game, they‚Äôre really cool rewards for putting in a lot of effort. You‚Äôll find them in the Triumph section at the bottom, look at the requirements for each one and consider chasing one (wayfarer is the easiest by far) good luck and hope you have a great time with the game!
---
Does anyone know how much of the game requires Playstation Plus and if it is feasable to play the game without it?  I just started a few hours ago, but when looking at map, saw some stuff say Playstation Plus required.  I don't wanna dump a lot of time into the early game just to be locked out later on.
---
Got a role that I almost broke down with tap the trigger and dynamic sway reduction with a stability masterwork.
---
No damage buff to maintain.  No reload speed increase.
---
But my God have I grown to love it.  I recently got recluse, played a few matches and then went back to my Cailou.  Did the same with exit strategy (though it is my new backup).
---
What is that?sorry no idea what is DIM
---
Ive gotten 2 65 legs to drop and a 63 chest piece
---
Congrats! I'm currently working on recluse, dont have mountaintop yet...
---
Some use it for jumping around maps in crucible. Bouncy hunters live longer if people can‚Äôt shoot you. Can‚Äôt kill what you can‚Äôt catch. 
---
As for PVE, it‚Äôs not one you will probably wear. It‚Äôs awesome for jumping puzzles like outbreak, whisper and some parts of raids. You‚Äôll usually use rigs or shards probably, unless there‚Äôs another exotic piece that fits your play style better. It definitely makes anything jump heavy a lot easier. Definitely worth keeping in your inventory, but not necessarily worth raising the light of.
---
DIO!
---
I have it but typing comments covers up the post for me lol
---
They‚Äôre great! Almost always on my hunter.
---
Congratulations! Welcome to the club!
---
It has been replaced by the Swordflight set. You're one season late, sadly
---
It really doesn‚Äôt take long at all I‚Äôm a person who hates crucible but I finished it in no time at all
---
I‚Äôve played this guy and he literally only uses that with one eyed mask. One time I played him without it and he was trash.
---
i played in momentum with fighting lion and edge transit or just using colony and hoping i can run into a group of them. Sadly its luck on multis but momentums increased damage makes its easy but its all jade rabits and randys so if you go that route watch your head
---
First time?
---
Client was my strat before the heavy nurf. Used to give 6 rounds now only 3 takes 2 to kill usually
---
Pretty sure it was year 1 crucible armor. If you didn't get it then, it's gone.
---
Xur, bottom left, comes around every weekend from about 2 pm Friday to early Monday. He sells exotic gear, and is great for new light players who don‚Äôt have many exotics. He sells one exotic weapon, three pieces of exotic armor (one for each class), and a fated engram that gives you one exotic that you don‚Äôt have yet. Get the armor and weapon before the engram so you don‚Äôt get a duplicate. He also shows up at a random location every time, so it‚Äôs suggested that you look up where he is.
---
Edit: I pulled a Titan and confused basic directions, my bad. Xur is on the bottom right not the bottom left.
---
Thank you, will try this.
---
Also, what i meant by killing the magic is that i feel like im still missing out after playing a bit. 
---
Other games i play, i feel a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction:)

---
Thankyou! Have seen so many unique Exos that i Had to create my own! Going to be fun art for sure! :D
---
Yep.
---
momentum give increase in weapon damage so grenades do way more damage making multis a little easier just watch out for randys knife and jade rabbit

Is momentum still around? I didn't even think about that i was too busy enjotlying scouts

---
My name rn is Savathun's Massive Milkers. I need to beat a record and get one of these letters now.
---
Was like this for me when I first started. You only come up against teams all in the same clan in the main playlist. So like everyone else here has said, make sure you play freelance so that you only get matched with other guardians that aren't in a fireteam. It's the smaller icon under the main survival icon in the crucible screen.
---
Other than that, it's just practice and getting familiar with the maps. While you don't necessarily need to, I've found I've been doing better since grinding specific gear to get a build with synergy. So jump back into PvE now and then if there is gear you are still missing for a build.
---
But please put a Back-Up Mag on that sweet piece of loot.
---
So you think the world is out to get ya. SMH.
---
thank you i‚Äôll definitely be grabbing one
---
It could help. I'll try it.

Yeah that‚Äôs lame, those guys should‚Äôve been open to teach. Datto has guides that are nice if you‚Äôre bored and have nothing to watch on YT but tbh try to watch full raid clears. Mr fruit and the dream team are all morons (i say it lovingly) but datto explains it to them and they run through all the raids in real time. So I‚Äôd watch those

ENVOY DOWN, PAT THAT CAT

I think the ok boomer meme is totally fine.

We ended up with this shit of a planet and whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
Has a chance to be on gear made at its respective forge. It can drop on armor as well, so make sure you stock up on forge polymers.
---
I understand. I felt the same frustration before I found the100. Adulting is what truly ruins the magic of games ;)

Dammit, another gash darn jojo reference

i am confidant that is what is going on i was against a shit ton of fighting lions in momentum but regular and iron banner nobody is using fighting lion

Ask Saint XIV
---
I think it looks cool, but you do you
---
imagine getting 108k kills on with average roll at best lmao
---
Been moving up a little more since switching from IB to that yeah.
---
They all die instantly with Colony on Momentum, decent ammo pool (thanks to increased heavy spawns), and quite often gives multi kills. I found it amazing just a couple days ago, farmed the mountaintop from 5% to 100% in 3 or so hours.
---
Keep at it! :)
---
Not working for me either. Same with bungie app
---
How does blast radius increase full court damage?\]
---
Edit: Nvm I found [a relevant discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/dq9tgz/i_found_a_very_interesting_thing_about_the_full/). Some people say it hurts spike more than it helps full court. There are YT videos supposedly supporting both sides of the claims, will have to watch them later.
---
If it's close, then doesn't that make handling or reload the god roll?
---
It literally looks a cardboard box for a helmet. Don‚Äôt try to justify it.
---
Thanks Guardian, you too!
---
Well there are the thanatonauts which intentionally die to experience visions
---
I've pretty much given up on the idea that people learn how to play control.
---
You see it all the time. The posts about "how to play control" is usually just about how that one guy not capping zones is a bad player.
---
Says a lot about the pvp community.
---
Me: Shoots titan with twelve bullets
---
Titan: Punches me once and tbags my corpse.

You‚Äôre telling me pal, there‚Äôs a lot of broken stuff in crucible too lol
---
Rare bounties drop from completing Ada bounties and from completing any forge.  If you go the bounties route save up 8-10 to turn in all at once for a better chance of getting the rare to drop.
---
I don't have to justify my reason for liking something's aesthetic ?? It's my opinion
---
Most of the time I go to B (or close to the point so I'm not so exposed) and wait for someone to get there too because more than 3 on A doesn't make that sense to me but no one cames and I end up killed by the enemy team.
---
The forces have been placed on a node in the EDZ that cycles through all of the forges.

No need to activate anything, all the dlc is there if you downloaded the season pass. Just go to the drifter to grab the last word quest and any other questions you may have can either be answered by youtube or this reddit

The forges are on a daily rotation, they bergusia forge comes tomorrow morning 10 am PST. Have fun.
---
Wait until Burgusia is in rotation (Takes 24h to rotate) Hope tomorrow is Burgusia and not Gofanon

Source for shader?

Anyone that agrees with this have literally never done a raid before. Stop making the game easier. Stop making the game more casual. Its end game. Its not meant to be casual. If you want easy casual games go play cod. Or borderlands or literally any story based or solely pvp based game. They tried matchmaking activities that require mechanics/are raid esque. The result was nobody being able to fully clear mockery or hell even something as simple as crystals in menagerie. It will never work. It will never happen. I will say it again. *Stop trying to make destiny more casual* year 1 was casual destiny and it killed the franchise.
---
Ps not wanting the game to be casual doesnt make you an elitist it makes you a person that wants destiny to thrive and maintain its long replability

everyone that hates these types of posts everyday.

you would gain alot from watching some YouTube videos on topics you are curious about. For little things that will help you get use to the current game and stuff.. feel free to check out my channel:  [youtube.com/c/OrdinarySense](http://youtube.com/c/OrdinarySense) . I have a new light playlist and a ton of other videos that i think would help. As for more indepth stuff, Datto is pretty good and has covered everything you asked about :  [https://www.youtube.com/user/DattoDoesDestiny](https://www.youtube.com/user/DattoDoesDestiny) . Hope this helps!

Everyone is allowed to have an opinion even if it‚Äôs wrong
---
Why were you even bothering? That terror is literally unkillable.
---
Good luck man I‚Äôm working on my flawless completion now I know I can solo it. I‚Äôd honestly suggest trying to use a warlock if you can because it‚Äôs difficult on a hunter for sure but if you can do it on a hunter then power to you man
---
Zavala's Tiny PP shall RIDE AGAIN
---
‚ÄòTis but a scratch.
---
Hit me again daddy... üòÜüòÜ
---
I literally don't see any Pikes in tangled shore...anywhere
---
Hmm, you have no idea why it's not showing up for me? I see Titan but no indicator of Flashpoint happening there.
---
Now make a titan one where the background is drawn in crayon.
---
I had 3 tests during this week and all I wanted to do was grind my levels for the season pass
---
There should be a yellow icon above Titan this week.
---
Unless I'm mistaken, you can still get heroic adventures directly from Brother Vance as well.
---
Just got last word today after some great survival win streaks. Such a cool gun, I had no idea it was full auto and the animations are badass
---
There‚Äôs no such thing as warlock jump only warlock float
---
The rings a bell but can't remember myself so lol
---
[removed]
---
It's more of a subie rather than an evo. Also, it's a hatch so I have more room to fit titan memes.
---
Does Sloane have a gold border? If not have you done some public events, lost sectors, or adventures on titan since tuesady?
---
Are you in iron banner? If so, what's your Light level?
---
Is this a joke?
---
Everyone recluse is the same. Unless u are playing iron banner, recluse is strong when u proc it's buff if you are having troubling getting that first frag then the issue isn't the gun.
---
Ah so there is a lore reason for the change in look
---
You can't anymore, but I think huckleberry can be obtained from any planet's heroic adventures.
---
Oh, yea I think you have to spend 5$ in the steam store. If there are any games around that price that you are interested in go for one of those. If you haven‚Äôt ever played and you have some friends who are also interested Magica is a pretty good game.
---
T‚Äòis but a scratch!
---
When I thought of this post, yes I was in iron banner. My light is 956.
---
Yeah man I reckon I can solo it too but it‚Äôs just the matter of flawless, aye I have a warlock and Titan at 960-965ish so it‚Äôs possible but lack a lot of exotics for both
---
And you know that level is turned on in iron banner, right?
---
It's been awhile since I played Gambit. Once I got Breakneck I stopped.
---
I feel offended. I just always wanna be the tank/the mental guy running into battle with a hammer while eveyone else is using guns
---
How does one get to that light level?
---
ah yes, thank you
---
That's a fair point, didn't think about that...
---
Can confirm, have tested: Yes, it is safe.
