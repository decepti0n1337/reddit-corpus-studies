That would be a good good hand cannon lol
---
---
---
Are they lol would be funny if it was linked in to getting a powerful weapon or even the exotic kenetic beam rifle 
---
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh all that grind
---
If they are used for something then it would probably be for a secret catalyst quest like how you have to hit each E.P boss, each week for the world-line zeros.
---
To far for a lockon
---
You can just get lucky shooting the primevil with your super when its health is low.

Yeah Titans completely ruin crucible. That kill-shield ability and the charge are horrible.
---
I‚Äôm a hunter main soooo
---
My guess is they insta-downvoted when they read the title.
---

---
This community is full of people really happy with their broken gear and armors and that really don't want a balanced game. The grinded hard for those pieces of invader armors you see? And how are they supposed to win a match if they don't have better gear that the other team?  ¬Ø\\\\\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 
---
In a free to play title, where the content is paid for by microtransactions, sure.
---
If I'm paying for the base game and all its content, having to form out extra for cosmetics is ridiculous.
---
If *you* think that's fine, good for you. But believe it or not, you don't have to blindly accept monetisation schemes that are quietly shoehorned into games you like, especially when you're old enough to remember that it never used to be this way.
---
Did the same thing.
---
Great gun but the quest step that requires you to get reported for hacking was tricky.
---
There is no best way. You just play the game and one day one happens to drop. 
---
Happened to me. Rip.
---
This tiny book has a lot of pages for something I know nothing about.

Top tree GG is where the truly skilled guardians play

Is their a certain place I should go to up my chances?
---
Hey guys, this person makes sense !!! Throw them out the window, feet first.

well 99% of Guardians cant bank their motes when the Drifter says to so not surprised.

Hahahah

I  would recommend not using the spark of light or you will skip the story of curse or osiris and warmind

It's worth getting just for the mission. It's so fun, one of my favorite D2 experiences.

No, stop that...

Ugh I miss that set so much. I loved the way it looked on my Hunter &amp; Titan with the shader that made the green parts red. It was so dope. 
---
Polaris Lance? Not sure how great it could be for you but I like using it. 
---
Tried it, it‚Äôs great on larger maps but I have crappy rng and keep getting the tiny ones, but thanks I‚Äôll keep it in mind!
---
Easy. 
---
I completed every video game content related task.
---
Took me 15 minutes.
---
Yeah, about that...
---
Damn, that must've taken some work! Looks great!

How do you even get a .2 K/D üòÇüòÇüòÇ not saying this is the posters kd but damn that sucks 
---
That looks amazing! How long did it take?
---
Ready for gambit 
---
Me: "I don't like invading."  
---
Primeval stomp: "Well guess what?"
---
I should have the gun then 
---
im talking about the PvE invisibility 
---
should've said that before 
---
Must be bugged. Oh well
---
I have four New Monarchy tokens in my inventory. I can‚Äôt even put them in my Vault. They just take up space.

Retreat to airlock guardian
---
U dont need to ik I've seen the reviews it's not that worth it but it's my fav fusion from year 1 and I dont have an erentil so this is easier to obtain 
---
Then what the fuck are you doing in the subreddit for this game?
---
1k voices if you have instead of grinding your ass off for one
---
Wanna hear something Awesome?  I got a Spare Rations with subsistence and multi kill clip....talk about a worthless combo :(

You fought, you won!

Your treasure awaits below. It calls to you, yyyeeeeeesssssssss?

I've waited my whole life for this moment.

Congratulations... you survived the PRISON... of Elders

I don‚Äôt like that the shoulder charge from the top tree is a one hit...but the slam melee from code of the missile isn‚Äôt üßê
---
The War Cult Hand Cannon was more or less tied with Better Devils for DPS.
---
Not a single time has ace been an issue and very little for thorn. 
---
I screamed BROOO 
---
Thorn is really...really bad in crucible. 
---
The Last Forgotten Ace of Thorns 
---
I couldn't bear to watch
---
No.
---
Big facts
---
I mean if you are lagging badly it isn't a good experience for anyone
---
On my end the connection feels totally smooth though :(
---
"You can use it as long as you dont get killed in the crucible. Once you die it vanishes and you have to grind for it all over again."
---
The real mystery is how they lined up the handshake first try
---
I got 2 jemini jesters in a row in under a week so no I don‚Äôt get why you think they should fix it it seems fine to me
---
No. Sunshot, Graviton Lance and Sweet Business were exclusive to faction rallies in the last season of year 1.  I got 2 out of 3 but figured I'd get the last one the season after Forsaken released. They originally announced that there would be no rallies the season of Forsaken release because of all the other new content, but it's 2 seasons since then and no mention of rallies in the roadmap either.  =(
---
Unfortunate :( you cant really do mich now but hopefully you wont get banned in the future for it
---
It DDoSes people. 
---
Yea, probly will get banned again though, can‚Äôt get great internet because of where I live. 
---
mountaintop + recluse = win
---
It‚Äôs always a safe bet to go with a primary shotgun like Parcel of Stardust or DRB with luna‚Äôs, but i switch to a sniper like Bite of the Fox or Aachen for long range maps. This also allows for an exotic heavy, such as Wardcliff or Tractor Cannon (super shutdown) if youd like. Havent unlocked recluse yet so i cant tell you what to use for that
---
really*
---
First of all no. Shards is actual garbage for PvE and PvP IMO since the nerf. The warlock helmet should be nerfed exactly the same way shards was. Shards was nerfed into the ground same.
---
BRUH DONT YOU BE TALKING SMACK ABOUT MY HORROR STORY I WILL 1V1 YOU ANY DAY THE THE FREAKING WEEK
---
Golden gunners get barely any damage buff and can be killed by an average gun easily
---
The F does she sell green super low power level weapons
---
Lol earlier today I joined a gambit prime match where the other team had summoned their primeval, had 5 knights and 2 captains sitting at our bank, and their invader was watching at our spawn with a sniper rifle. 
---
I take pride in the fact that I managed to bank a captain‚Äôs worth of motes in that game before they beat us. 
---
Yes! 
---
I wish it actually shot tractors. I feel like that would up my enjoyment of the crucible by about 1000%.
---
Eververse is only faction
---
Anthem‚Äôs content is even less than that...
---
Only joke is that you retards think theres anything worthwhile in d2. Morons clinging on to a dying dream that someday bungie might actually come through. 
---
What would that even shoot, kinetic beam, like hard light?
---
trivago
---
Best*
---
Yeah bruv, every type of piece (helm/arms/chest/boots) has a set roll.
---
Well, it‚Äôs literally his job.
---
Looks like an epic battle scene, where the knight was thrown off the bridge by a guardian!
---
Awh, how humbling that you asked 100% completely organically and willingly! I'd love to.
---
But on a serious note; everyone reading this, this post is the kind of quality we look for here in r/destiny2. I do love and respect all these memes, but this post checks all the boxes - direct video capture (thank god), high effort and actually funny. Good job, u/SmolKayn. Post approved.

Is the catalyst called DSP?

Unfortunately your connection is ruining pvp for other people you are playing against 
---
Really cool. Wiping off the dust on my Titan armor now. üòâ
---
I WAS READING ALL THE COMMENTS AHEAD AND WAS THINKING THE EXACT SAME THING YOU FUCKER XD
---
Not cellphone videos.
---
Direct-capture only. 
---
I think it's the House Dusk logo, as seen in the EDZ
---
In comp I did the same shot with the same gun and made the same damage... and still he killed me
---
I understand they're considering a Power Hand Cannon. So you can roll with 3 hand cannons at a time.
---
.
---
nah, I'm bullshitting. but I had you worried for a minute there, didn't  I?
---
I thought it was a view through both scopes of the queenbreaker bow. 
---
Its cool  
---
I actually found that step pretty easy
---
Good call. Sometimes I Blueberry real hard.
---
Thank appreciate it a lot, sadly I'm PC. Wished there was cross play. But hopefully i catch up.
---
Pesky titans with synthoceps bothering you? Use Liar‚Äôs Handshake today! (May contain traces of shitty rng)

I have a horro's, least with dragonfly headseeker and a dragonfly spec. It's really quite powerful. 
---
wtf
---
laughs in arcstrider
---
This comment once again shows the balance problem that Destiny (and a lot of other games have). People get cheese killed by J√∂tunn in pvp so they hate the gun, but it's so fucking amazing and fun in pve...
---
Ah a fellow intellectual
---
I think it's good when it works and it usually only works in specific situations
---
Oh god.
---
Dont be scared of postning more stuff. This was/is awsome. Where are you planing to out it if I may ask? 
---
How the fuck did you manage to do that ?
---
Yeah I sure wouldn't mind getting Sunshot and graviton lance's catalyst. Maybe they could do like with that grenade launcher Lion thingy (sorry guys forgot the name) and give us the catalyst during an event or something
---
I wish they bring back the year 1 destiny 1 orbit music
---
Good work, Guardian. Your light is strong! 
---
Thanks man!
---
My friends also asked why I never used blade barrage and stuck with the bird. It only took one run through the raid to show em the power of the hawk baby. 
---
"don't look at me like that, it's your fault for siding with him"

"Snitch!"

You... You...... You are lucky!

*LOVE* this! Very awesome, man. Be proud!

# THIS IS AMAZING!
---
# I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT I'M SEEING!
---
Thats fucking awesome
---
Agreed, it was op in pvp but now its just useless in pve and pvp
---
What!? No worthiness jokes? For shame, I have lost all faith in this sub.
---
We are not worthy. 
---
Still couldn't stop a spectral blades
---
Exactly. I use the Tripmine Gauntlets now lol
---
You should be more afraid someone else will get this tattooed lol , great job
---
Quick update - back down to 40%. Might just kill myself tbh.
---
I'd rock this as a tat
---
I wish they made so many more of these. They're golden.
---
 Awesome work! I‚Äôm planning on getting a Destiny sleeve, I would totally get this tattooed. Keep up the great work!
---
Fucking amazing concept I might have to use it when I start my destiny sleeve tattoo 
---
So many stories of famous artists in all mediums throwing out paintings/manuscripts/song lyrics only for someone to save them and pushing the creator to finish them. Wonder how many more masterpieces were lost because their creators were too critical of themselves...
---
I like this I would get a bit more detail on the traveller tho maybe? 
---
Please do! 
---
that‚Äôs one eyed mask tho
---
April fools joke?
---
If you ever press the pause button while downloading the game this sort of glitch happens. I guess try a reinstall without pausing.
---
i got mine on my third run üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Do you have any other tat designs btw? I've been thinking about getting a small one and the ghost by itself that you have in this pic would be perfect I think. 
---
You really have a talent my man. Like others have said though, push up that confidence. Fake it till you make it and all that, just post it saying "I made this Destiny tattoo idea, what do you guys think?" That way you get more feedback on your art and less on you as a person (like I'm doing right now...)
---
That makes it more worth it lol, because black armory is new pve wave Content, so is reckoning, and gambit lrime kinda but you still have invading
---
I would actually get a tat of this üëå
---
Not gonna lie though, if you want last word and thorn, you're gonna have to play pvp
---
Why are you complaining about a non roaming super that is almost exclusively used to shut down other supers? 
---
Congratulations man!
---
Actually, if you right click to preview a shader from your inventory, the shader does get applied to any exotics you have. So it already gives you a taste, it'll just never give you the actual thing. 
---
instructions unclear; now watching The Wiggles for tips on raid damage in Destiny.
---
I‚Äôll break out Nightstalker or Gunslinger if I have bounties to finish, but I run Arcstrider most of the time. It‚Äôs just so satisfying to run around and smack things- and I kinda feel like I‚Äôm in one of those old kung fu movies, too. 
---
The rest of the team can do that, go invade! üòÇ
---
It‚Äôs a DPS monster, and it‚Äôs good for your everyday bosses thanks to that sexy super restoration element. 
---
Whisper is a BEAST in the correct setting. For example in Bergusia forge it is AWESOME. It's worth going for AND worth masterworking.
---
Find it funny I team up with ppl with full invader gear yet don't invade üòÇ
---
Thank you! I do have plans to do other subclasses as well, one day. =) It‚Äôll be a while, though. 
---
And hey- you never know! It took me quite a bit of practice before getting to this point. I believe in you! 
---
I find it funny when hunters invade üòÇ
---
some matches are just more trouble then they're worth though. if you end up in a match without a tether hunter or a well warlock you're not going to have the best of times.
---
What do you mean by the, restoration element.
---
I'm a hunter main lol but only use sleeper and not blade barrage üòÇ
---
You get a good 3rd of your super back from one shoting bosses. I‚Äôm not sure if it increases if the explosion death kills other enemies. 
---
The hive lack the strength to mobilise an asdault on the city, savathun hasn't arrive with her war moons yet. And no one said take all of the guardians, 200 would be enough.

Oh well at least with the upcoming update we can use gunsmith mats to buy bountys to get cores üòÇ
---
Best rng ever! /s
---
Hey that's pretty good. 
---
No way! Everytime bungie nerfs a super they ruin it. Let's stop begging for nerds before all the supers are worthless. They called supers for a reason. 
---
Damn I wouldn't mind getting that tattooed on me. 
---
Have you finished the Gambit Prime introductory quest? That explains everything.
---
Why does my post get downvoted if I don't know, something? 
---
Oh no I didn't, thanks. 
---
Neat

Unbalanced??? No, it would be better, only for snipers tho... high risk, high reward

Maybe I‚Äôll get lucky and get an Icebreaker ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Looks like I missed you getting downvoted seems to be back to when you first post..not sure why you would but my guess is that people already know how to get synths and ppl would say to search first before posting if you can't see it on here then try r/Destinythegame

I really want to get this now but I don‚Äôt wanna steal someone else‚Äôs design or plan. Solid design buddy. It looks great.

 Yeah
---
It looks amazing! You are your hardest critic, so it makes sense that you would be scared to post it, but it is AWESOME!!!
---
I think that was an excellent job at debriefing nightwatch and I really want to see a review of outlast. 
---
If I could get it to drop for me üòÖ I would definitely do it! I appreciate the feedback!

...
---
Having bad RNG from T3 is where they're at.  the title is honestly mostly RNG
---
What platform, I might be able to help with the 100 motes. 
---
I be only seen the acsendant primaeval 3 times how are you that lucky
---
I'm assuming it's photoshop then, pretty sick
---

---
It hurts even more knowing all the armor just looks like trash.
---
[This](https://www.light.gg/db/new-items/season/6/gambit-prime-gear/) is all the new Gambit Prime stuff
---
Thank you 
---
This is f***in awesome! :D
---
I really want one but I can't get my power higher than 635 because I keep getting the same gear from prime engrams and no worries, I would also love to see a horror's least review just to see how good my dragonfly headseeker roll is compared to a godroll in your opinion. 
---
I've been using it in Prime and now that I feel like a competent sniper I feel like I'm wasting bullets every time I hit a 2k Crit haha
---
Oh damn I'm on xbox1. 
---
Yeah it's definitely the worst collection of Banner armour so far. 
---
:(
---
Uhm, okay?
---
The horror‚Äôs least I can grind for. I‚Äôll try to get one before reset and attempt to put together a video for it if I can get a decent drop.
---
LMAOOOOOOOOO
---
I honestly want them to go back to the original iron banner armor with the oni style mask hunters got. Had the full set with ornamets and everything made the grind all the more worth it. Now im just doing it for the bounties to reach 690 for t3 reckoning.
---
Man, this makes me wanna get a new tattoo.
---
I‚Äôve got it, underwhelmed. It‚Äôs a scout rifle, who uses scout rifles anyway? I played it a bit but I sure won‚Äôt sacrifice a weapon slot for it...
---
You must be fun at parties 
---
Wait, why would you need a win streak for dredgen?
---
Invading with Lemon? I pity your team
---
Not really. The RNG aspect for this title has less RNG compared to other titles.
---
Rule 11:  All videos and screenshots from in-game must be directly captured‚Äî phone screenshots and similar are not allowed   
---
Rule 12:  Keep all loot/achievement posts to the end of the week thread for them.

Hey

I can‚Äôt snipe üò¢
---
I got army of ones a few times
---
Plus we still won every game 
---
People do not invite me to parties. I wonder why.  
---
Nevertheless, rules exist for a reason. These shitposts are getting out of hand.
---
This just happened to me as well. 
---
i wont, since i agree
---
Oh okay, i'll try it out then thanks!
---
Ohh alright i didn't know that I'll definitely try all of this out because i really want to do Leviathan for the risk runner catalyst so badly
---
It's not that good at being bad homie. Nice work
---
get banned from the game and auto delete*
---
Thank you so much I really will appreciate the effort you put into that video. My friend got one on the 100k but we all decided to try doing a fun nightfall run and mine was the best roll, it's, in my opinion, a demigod roll because it has two great traits but it needs a bit more stability and reload speed. 
---
immune phases keeps him from getting melted and thank god..
---
The barrel is the bottom of the cylinder. The reason for this is so the distance between the barrel (which pushes back when a shot is fired) and the grip is shorter, so the barrel has less leverage on the grip so it recoils less. (I know I'm replying to a dead thread lol)
---
I can't change your mind but I like it. 
---
My roll on the only one I‚Äôve gotten is pretty terrible lol so I‚Äôm jealous of your roll already!
---
Yup. I‚Äôve delete so many till I realized you could just throw them in the vault.
---
Tbh I'm already running out of space so maybe I shouldn't üòÇ
---
no idea i was on asian servers for a short bit but before today i‚Äôve never seen this
---
Take the time to look at what in your vault can be pulled out of your collections. That‚Äôll help you clear out a lot of items just taking up space.
---
Nice 
---
I hated pvp, but after a while I tried it and really enjoyed it.  It might be worth trying a few games of quickplay
---
Good idea!

How to flex with a Alienware screen #1

JK
---
id argue he has a good attitude, he may not quite understand the reasons 6 stacking causes issues in gameplay, because if youre team sucks then youre essetially playing a 6v1 against a team with free heavy and farmed supers and abilitys.. which regardless of skill will make it extremely rough to deal with and means you cant alway come away with a pos kd all because you play smart or not scared.. but at least hes proposing the will to work against it and try and play and do better when it does happen rather than complain and blame it on everythings regardless if it really is everything elses fault..
---
You're welcome, hope you get it working.
---
That thing is fabulous in it's... Whatever it is. Let me guess, Eververse?
---
Guy on the top right looks like he went from crack to crack-alcohol 
---
Um excuse you. The first IB set we got looked amazing in Titans. 
---
Happens to me on occasion, I love running Forges, but I usually just try to solo it and hope people join in which they usually do. Sometimes they don't and I just abandon and start again we're good.

Are you serious? You need more confidence lol that‚Äôs really heccin good and amazing lol! And if I got tattoos, I‚Äôd definitely consider that one, with your permission of course
---
 I didn‚Äôt think I would but it‚Äôs awesome. I‚Äôve been pairing it with the iron banner grenade launcher and having a blast. I think it‚Äôs a great change of pace and has great range for some pretty versatile gameplay.

This was EPIC!  I actually got chills watching this!  Well done!

The ghost shell needs three rank resets and grinding for that is a lot faster with a win streak
---
Id assume nova bomb would too
---
There have been leaks from destiny 3 but as always take those with a grain of salt until there is official word of d3
---
Awesome! You going to add color or leave the black and white?
---
bot's acting a bit wonky today, just ignore it
---
I like Telesto! Didnt realise it was viable in PVP
---
It's a one shot like most fusions are and they are ment ti be powerful, you just need enough encounters to learn how to deal with it. 
---
He's probably already been there.  The Drifter once ran with the Shadows of Yor.  A group started Dredgen Vale (an alias of Shin Malphur) to draw out and subsequently destroy any Guardian who would be tempted too far down Sorrow's Road.  We also know that Shin Malphur has had at least one rather lengthy conversation with the Drifter.  We know that the Drifter "gave up" Calum Sol to Shin but Calum Sol was actually one of Shin's follower not a true believer in Yor.  The Drifter my yet be totally unaware that Dredgen Vale, someone he's presumabley dealt with many times, is in fact Shin Malphur.  
---
It used to be really good, now it's decent but not OP. It's nice because range doesn't really matter, just hit most of your shots from any distance and it will kill.
---
Nice I got it on numbah 3, not salty tho since I still had to run it after for more armor anyways XP
---
I'd keep it black and white. I cant imagine it with color. I wouldn't even know what color to go with. 
---
Instead put a minor spec on it. Scout rifles can't one shot low tried adds consistently and a minor spec will make your ammo more efficient and in turn make more explosions
---
this is really cool 
---
I recommend using Adobe Capture (free app) to take photos of stuff like this - it will clean eraser marks right up and produce a neat black and white image. Awesome work!

Forgot about this, true.

Ive already done the get kill but i gotta kill people who killed me  and i cant do that unless i legit let people kill me.

I suggest you either keep the one you've been using or keep both and use them both.

The *Brick in a sock* exotic titan gloves. Every mele attack one shot whatever you're punching. Can't use weapons, can't use other abilities, can't ult.

With the amount I have, my dps must be reaching divine levels. 
---
That was an unexpectedly completely just and fair explanation. I'll drink to that! Good to have you around here, you're doing great work brother!

I agree. They should've made a Transformer-like helmet. Like you're scanning your enemies when your ammo makes contact.

Nice thanks

Technically every week is a Curse Week (the Dreaming City is cursed) - but currently as of 31/3/19 its Curse week 2. As of 2/4/19 it will be Curse Week 3 and the doors to Mara's Court and the Shattered Throne will open once again.

I think you need more. That surely isn‚Äôt enough.

OG Celestial &gt; Victorian Silverhawk

Now imagine if the default Celestial was the ornament and Silverhawk was the default no one would ever take it off

No doubt mate....no doubt :)

I have attained it by dismantled curated. Worked on my end

Those two are unchanged. Its in your head.

I just hated getting caned by people who must live on PVP! and it's more cos my gf doesn't do pvp at all and we play together. So I want to make sure theres something for her to have to do on it too
---
Alrighty, excuse the android quality. I just feel that If I showed the entire screen, not many of you would see what I'm getting at. But I will listen in the future, thank you.

You can get the illicit gambit prime gear by synthesizing the synths and then completed the run. As far as Im aware the gambit prime weapons only drop in tier 2 and 3 as a completion reward. Other then the armour reqard at the end the rewards are the standard blue engram, legendary, prime and if your lucky exotics.

Ahh the good ol' days :)

What makes this the rarest?
---
Idk if you're on console or pc but on console the recoil and bloom of Thorn, Ace and less so on TLW makes them much harder to use. This isn't a change that would be taken well on console.
---
Yeah it definitelt is, that was never in the equation lol.
---
I smell crit spot
---
How do you get cursebreaker? Is it one of the secret ones? 
---
Yeah, I do too. It heavily depends on the shader you apply to it.
---
O thanks for letting know!
---
Maybe on light.gg it displays as rarest
---
Cursebreaker is the one I want, is it one of the secret ones? 
---
But, it has the Telesto charge meter, the Telesto projectiles, and I imagine the only reason the nova bomb tracked its caster was because it locked into a Telesto projectile. Most tellingly, there is a unique Telesto sillhouette in the equipped weapon HUD.
---
You only get 1 core per week don't you? That's nothing.
---
I'm still struggling with frigid jackal. did the last braytech weapon take you forever?
