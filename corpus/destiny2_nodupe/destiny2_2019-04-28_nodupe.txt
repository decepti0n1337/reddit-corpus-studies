100% Agree. Its what the game gave me after I used the Spark of Light.

---
Got it from comp on accident while farming the recluse üëå
---
L alt. I've never had a problem with the default key-binds to be honest.
---
I‚Äôve got a lot of shards and am pretty sick of lost sectors. Once I hit 700, there was no need to do the powerful one either. Especially as I had Lord of Wolves drop in the first week of Forsaken. Cores wise I tend to hover around 70, but 10 shards a day is worth dropping for another.
---
Once they did but there a legend now boy. Now come it's time for bed. Have sweet dreams of the 1000 whispers
---
I can never get all the bubbles popped. Even with people. I‚Äôve only ever done the heroic version once at the start of Forsaken

I keep getting them in the Verdent Forest.

4 so far.

Never use to get them before.

snek knives.

For some dumb reason people hate to pay for the full game then 40 bucks a year to get 3 dlcs.

I don‚Äôt run super mods either, I‚Äôm not that sweaty

It doesn‚Äôt anymore sorry. Those were removed from destiny 2 early in the game due to Bungie being a-holes.

Middle tree sun breaker is the way to go!
---
I didnt want the LH/NF. I dont like hand cannons at all. The way they feel and play.
---
The way that everyone and their mother has and uses HCs in PVP. Just ain't my cup of Tea.
---
I don't see how exclusive content would even be an issue. Either remove it when transferring or make it unusable until a later day when it becomes available. They did that for the wavesplitter that was obtainable from Xur for a short while.
---
How does one activate the heroic version
---
Hawthorne doesnt like the whole guardian thing. Plus she would have to die and lose all memories of her previous self.
---
Probably a Sweet Business.
---
I feel like your rig hunter should be giving you enough orbs to run lunafactions. I don't like having to reload my fighting lion by hand.
---
And why brother Vance isnt trying to push simulation seeds instead of radiolarian.
---
Looks like that Ogre failed his flawless run.
---
Fair enough
---
As a warlock, who doesn't have phoenix, it pains me. I want to satisfy others, but my Wells only goes half way and disappoint my team leaving them wanting...

---
The power level of loot is based on your power level. Not what you have currently equipped, it calculates it based on all the highest gear you own. 
---
Once you are above power level 500, the only way to get items that are at a higher power level than you are prime engrams or activities that list powerful gear as the reward (with a little picture of a prime engram). Other loot will be around 15-20 power levels below you.
---
No. Turning in the tokens won‚Äôt get you a higher reward. Doing their respective weekly milestones will though.
---
I believe those engrams will always drop lower tan your current power level (that's the total average level if you equipped the highest level piecein your inventory in it's perspective slot). Doing anything that lists "Powerful" reward should drop gear above your current total level.
---
It goes by your total level. So even tho your gun says 533 it only helps to add to that total which in your case would be 635.
---
Also apparently, you can get Lord of Wolves with Fated Engram, so it‚Äôs extra not worth it, unless of course you find them fun
---
Gotcha, don't really use Twitter but good to know.  Thank you.
---
Yeah it is unfortunate lately it feels like Bungie hasn‚Äôt even been testing their own game
---
Thirding this.
---
In our hearts and minds!
---
Nice
---
took me so long to see that lmao
---
that‚Äôs what u thought

Good point

Titan commandmends,

Uhoh. Little Timmy didn't get a trophy for participating. Time to cry about it so he will get his way.

‚ÄúGuardian, I‚Äôm trying to take back the shore, but I‚Äôm dummy thicc, and the clap of my ass cheeks keeps alerting the scorn‚Äù

Auto correct 100

Yes, that appears to be so. 
---
Jotuun*

Outlaw and kill clip :0
---
I‚Äôm on PS4, I bound it to pressing down on the joystick
---
What gun you using
---
Ace of Spades quest was hell for me
---
My tripmines? Neutered. My throwing knives? Nerfed. I've watched as people walk through my void grenades, and it was barely an inconvenience.
---
But yeah, hunters are on par with others. /s
---
Dodged a bullet. You didn't have to waste your time playing that trash map.
---
I made it! 69th!
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just beginning‚Äù he says staring at Malfeasance, Last Word, Thorn, and broken keyboards.
---
I just got stronghold on my titan and I only have like 25/122. Owch
---
*laughs in collector*
---
Nah, I don't have either of those. I got the BA sniper rifle... but the fire rate, reload time, and mag size made it undesirable to me. I feel like I get a higher DPS with the Conspirator.
---
Last week with xur only needed shards of galanor and celestial nighthawk, got shards from xurs random engram and celestial 10 minutes later from a exotic drop.  Have not seen one since....
---
I haven't found one that feels like it helps my build yet.
---
I know players with kids that have five minutes of free time a week to read the TWAB. You're running out of bullshit to throw lol
---
If you're on PC it wont change the meta that much, LH/NF aren't too common to begin with, it's all about recluse, ace, and TLW
---
It shall come, brother. Be patient for bungo.
---
Actually, i think they fixed that so it works as it should
---
I would argue that many would rather come here to see what the community is saying. Generally Bungie's news is shared and well explained by posts from members. Don't hate on others because they didn't go to the direct source.
---
I see you be gotten the corrupted egg there
---
Playing on PC. I don't really spend a lot of time testing things. I just take note of what I'm currently using compared to what I just got and consider swapping based on the difference I notice. I was using Zenobia-D and was blown away by how Hammerhead made boss health melt away relative to that.
---
Oh I don't mean to sound like I'm hating on them, I guess I could have phrased that better. My sarcasm tends to translate poorly through text at times.
---
That‚Äôs awesome man, did you take it?
---
I agree. The difference in Reckoning is night and day without a well running. It just sucks when you know an item exists that would make it more efficient.
---
Only bullshit I see is you.
---
You‚Äôre most welcome captain bullshit.
---
Suffering from success
---
Thought that was the Shattered Throne for a minute. Very nice!
---
Revelry is over next week. Try it then. But yeah revelry is busted
---
Gives me serious Gears of War vibes
---
If you‚Äôre on console i totally get it, but on PC there‚Äôs like 10+ weapon and weapon variants that are good
---
I use V with my tumb.
---
Raid.report my friend. It‚Äôs a life-saver
---
Not really sure it makes things look and feel better but it ultimately doesnt change a persons base skill on pc or console at that. What does is the mouse's flexibility not only in movement but also the ease of aiming, shooting and keeping the recticle steady. Since you dont have to use your thumb to control recoil like on console. Its also why pc pvp in most fps games tend to be balanced because of how easy a mouse makes things.
---
Just got one today, was hard light, im newbie, but, i think it is garbage, right?
---
Exotic hand cannon
---
Right! Dudes amazing, been a doctor, solider, teacher, astronaut, and now a destiny beast.
---
*HR would like to speak to you*
---
probably hard as fk but try to find a 4 stack who need GL kills and have already reached fabled. go into comp and trade losses for multikills. its cheesy but will save a lot of your sanity.
---
r/fireteams
---
If it was only destiny2 I would explore the hell out that.
---
Math is hard
---
Of coarse
---
BITCONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECT@ also applies.
---
Might ask some of my friends to do this. Thanks for the tip tho
---
You fucking bet we do
---
Heides tower of flame is kinda white
---
Apparently the problem is with any amount of stick drift. You have to hold whichever sticks are drifting (or both to be safe) when applying the shader etc. and you should be able to do it now.
---
Thanks
---
I also have whisper fully masterworked. Did you have to open all the chests or can I skip them and just go straight to the Oracle chest?
---
It's beautiful, indeed, and it reminds me that Destiny is the BEST GAME I've ever played despite its bugs and flaws...
---
Well, IKELOS is the best way but otherwise:
---
- Use as many Void weapons as you can, and either your favourite handcannon or something like a Void SMG, getting headshots is important.
---
- Play Competitive or Iron Banner
---
- Use your Void subclass for an additional few dots of Void damage. I used Spectral Blades for this
---
GG, I didnt know the Whormhusk was that crazy with the revelry buff on, its non stop action with that thing
---
It's not my fault RNG gave me swashbuckler on my Spare rations I can't kill you easier without punching you
---
Alright thanks. Been using a duke mk44/lemon arc with a random void heavy. Is competitive really that much better? I don't really want to go down the shinobu's vow path, but every day counts because I really want the shirt.
---
Double?! Far out, guess it's gonna be time for me to get ahold of the recluse as well.
---
Good bot
---
It's all about time efficiency. You get given 20 minutes or so to finish the whole thing before you get booted out. The first half is a massive platform's section which you should probably look up guide for. The second half are loads of taken enemies that hit you very hard which you need to clear out.
---
It's possible to solo, but you'd need to play pretty well with good weapons. The revelry tonic (part of the current event) could help you with this if you just spam grenades. It's much easier with two other people though.
---
...PC gamer.
---
The button opens the door in the back right if I remember correctly.
---
Learn to shoot the bomb yourself, wise brother/sister. The damage done to all heathens caught in the blast is the same, yet your hand controls who it annihilates.
---
After finishing all the triumphs associated with running the Forest and all that, I play it now for fun, so it's possible they are using that gun for such. Might as well use something different to add a little spice to your playthrough.
---
Yes, I'm in a very active clan. Getting a team that knows how to reckon is easy.
---
thank you
---
As long as it's old-school 3v3 and not 4v4 I'm on board with a return of trials and have been wanting it back for so long
---
After the drop rate has been raised its no big deal anymore. Now like everyone has the Cursebreaker
---
That's not an engram, that's a Beacon!
---
-the Kryn Dynasty wants to know your location-
---
 Party Hard vs Party Harder... any honest mistake
---
Ah fuck
---
I want a man who runs to me like you ran to that engram.
---
Came here to say this
---
I agree 100% i had to use a controller at first in pvp when i first switched because i hadnt played much with a mouse so it was difficult to use but ive been getting better over time
---
If you don't already have that helmet, than you're out of luck.
---
That's why. It shows tending things from all. If you're on Android there's a bunch of third party apps. I use relay for Reddit myself, but there's tons of good ones
---
Keep playing, keep coming here and reading posts, and keep googling or searching this sub and it will all start to come together. Remember, you're coming in cold to a game that's been growing for over 2 years, and there's plenty to learn. It's Hella fun though.
---
Best advice I can give is read u/Hatherence 's comments because that dude knows what he's talking about. And try to find a clan and use LFG tools to find people to play with and they will teach you a lot as you play. If you just got Forsaken, or you're about to, do the refer-a-friend thing so you can get a buddy that will play with you often and show you the ropes.
---
It looks like Hatherence answered the questions in your post, but if you have other questions in the future and can't find an answer from searching, make more posts or feel free to DM me. 
---
If you're on Xbox you can add me. Gamer tag is the same as my username.
---
keeping the highlight in the center doorway was such a good decision, i love it.
---
High cal rounds are the best choice.
---
Thanks!!!
---
Witches Ritual public events on Titan and Mars.
---
Bruh, who runs hand cannon-sidearm?
---
The rate of power level increase will slow down the farther you get into the game. Specifically, at power level 500. 
---
There is a small enough number of guns that as you play, you will see you are getting slightly different versions of the exact same guns, which allows you to better pick and choose which ones you actually want to keep.
---
It looks like the perfect setting for a vr game
---
It never comes off my brother
---
Quickplay, rumble, and iron banner are the only options for the triumph that asks you to generate revelry orbs in crucible or gambit, since revelry orb generation has been disabled in gambit and comp. 
---
In the most recent TWAB (This Week at Bungie news post) they said they will be changing that triumph to only require 20 orbs instead of 200.
---
Personally, I am at 4 total orbs generated despite being almost done with most of the iron banner bounties, so I don't think this is worth it for one emblem.
---
Service revolver and recluse meta here I come
---
I *just* took it off this week when Tess sold Kabr's ship because I love the vault of glass, but I feel so dirty now that I might have to just put Saint's back on
---
I've wanted a neat Sidearm/Shotgun for so long i've kinda lost hope.
---
We need an exotic Auto rifle in the 720rpm
---
Those are triangles, not pentagons.
---
Your lack of sprint disturbs me
---
Service Revolver is also very solid, I never used crimson much so it wouldn't know, but I believe it shoots several bullets at a time.
---
It‚Äôs a good book. Totally worth it.
---
You can go and act like I'm getting heated but Im just giving it to you straight,  if want to suggest a buff or nerf , the least you can do is say the static's of the situation :\
---
Epic moment!!!! Yeah!!!! Pew!!! Dead. LoL
---
Make sense bro
---
My first thought was "Why are you running a Tigerspite on Equinox? That is the sniper/scout rifle map."
---
Statistics* damn auto correct
---
Get out
---
You posted this same thing three days ago.
---
Mmmm arms look to be Metro Shift, judging by the blue. Rest of it might be as well
---
Hold up. Were you playing comp on your *phone*?
---
I think you misunderstood me. While LH in  the hands of someone who is skilled with it is really good it is also the weapon with the steepest skill curve I've ever seen. Compared with the ease of use that AoS provides there is no comparison. LH has such terrible range that it is sub-par to any well-rolled bygones/go figure/blast furnace/right side/inaugural.
---
it took them nine months to fix the two most broken hand cannons in the game. They're not exactly buffing and nerfing all the time
---
www.etsy.com/market/icosahedron
---
Right yes sorry. I did that one without realising. 
---
Used a duke and did a nightfall solo to farm them.
---
Exactly. They‚Äôve let them reign supreme. Now something else will. It‚Äôs not like they dramatically nerf something every week.
---
SAITAMA NO!
---
honestly, every popular game has a LOT of complaints.
---
la forskina....
---
Well we had age of triumphs at the end of year one. We‚Äôll definitely have something like that for year two as well.
---
That was Solstice of Heroes
---
I am (terribly) playing a crucible match in destiny 2. While trying to take a zone I meet a fellow teammate who requests a fist bump. The second our fists touch I get sniped by an opponent.
---
Riiight üòÖ I hear whispers of us going into year 3 with D2 so the end game is still far away. Fingers crossed tho!
---
Just got the Annual pass on my PC recently (coming from PS4), and I gotta be honest. I forgot how much of a grind it is to get to max light. Let alone all the exotic quests.
---
When you logged in a short while ago, there was a popup notification saying Revelry orb generation has been disabled in raids, competitive crucible, and gambit because it was causing a lot of crashes. This means you can complete the triumph in non-competitive crucible (quickplay, rumble, iron banner). In the current This Week at Bungie news post, they said they will decrease the orbs required to be 20 on the competitive triumph because of this. 
---
The triumphs aren't really clear about this, but they only count the revelry orbs, meaning orbs that come from headshots. Normal masterwork and super orbs don't count.
---
You have until May 7 to do this, so you still have plenty of time!
---
Got a laugh from me. 
---
Most people already understand the reference you‚Äôre making just by hearing the voice line/reading it though. Next time I would shy away from putting the video of whatever you‚Äôre using on the screen as well and just doing a subtle chat bubble/headline type over whoever is saying the line. 
---
This is purely just my opinion though, but the video block kind of detracts from the rest of the meme-y vibe you‚Äôre trying to send. But, like I said, the vid still made me laugh. Especially the error message sound at the end when he missed his charge. You did a great job &lt;3
---
Ahh thank you.
