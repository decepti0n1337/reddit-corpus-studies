Hey! Great job! Whats auto rifle are you using?
---
---
---
This is low effort/useless content.
---

---
Thanks.
---
Hunters are the best
---
lol no
---
Why did he deserve it he may have had a bullet on his back but that doesn’t mean he can’t go out with a fight and prove a point cayde didn’t deserve it because he was the only good character in this damn game and Bungie took him away
---
So, I went to a play in seattle with the original voice actor for osiris. This is back in D1. Throughout the whole play I felt like I knew his voice wayyyy too well. Looked at his credit on the poster for the play and he was the voice of osiris. In the play he was a false prophet conning these people. Never know what these voice actors do the rest of the time.
---
Wat.
---
So if I bring up power rangers , now it's a crossover between 4? Right. It's not a crossover just because it's brought up. Because there was no effort to actually cross the references.
---
No worries. I'll still be playing when you come on 
---
Some things can never be unseen. Thanks satan
---
i never want to see this format again
---
It's the Last Wish raid exotic. You only get one shot at getting it each week per character. 
---
Didnt titans also work with striker grenades? 
---
21 Prometheus catalyst
---
Rule Number 5 my dude.
---
U damn right I give him a platinum
---
Oh boy, the amazing Mythoclast, why can’t we have such great weapons as we did in D1.
---
Those were THE times when exotics REALLY felt special, original and powerful.
---
no it definetly does not
---
Thanks, appreciated
---
If you think that number is impressive, you're in a world of shock and awe.
---
How is this advertising?
---
this will be my first thing to try aswell
---
That's number 6
---
If you want to, sharing it so it gains traction is the best. The only hope is that Bungie goes out of their way to ban him, as the report system in the game doesn't work at all.
---
Learning to snipe here I'd like some pointers
---
That’s one of the best D1 exotics. Whoever was fortunate to use it know what I’m talking about.
---
Dude. I ground d1 soooooo hard and it was probably because of it. And tbh, the Shakespearean of the play lost me at times but the sound of his voice carried in my brain.
---
Stick together don’t spread out to much
---
Focus on the tougher enemies when they spawn as they add more time than the others 
---
Fuck oem. Defensive Strike is bae tho, if you survive a melee battle, you need that hp and overshield in 99% cases afterward, and it's on melee cooldown.
---
Seems like a lot of love for bungie today 
---
What activity exactly did you get it on?
---
Even the name Vex Mythoclast evolved such fear back then. And maps were more exciting and better 
---
Ok how do U get that sparrow. Now. Like right now. 
---
Omg his life comes full circle lmao
---
Like wise guardian.
---
Red looks good
---
I can't stop laughing
---
For the first two waves, prioritize killing blue enemies. This adds more time than throwing batteries. 
---
For the boss, either have everyone hide at the spawn or in the cave leading to outside in the far left corner. As long as no one gets too close to him, he will not move as much, so it is easier to get headshots. 
---
Personally I use the caves off to the right since there is more cover, a good shottie is very helpful for the blue guys, and you can set one guy up just to throw balls if you need. 
---
Really helpful if you have a Lock with a well to use for the boss too, but it's not a thing you have to use. 
---
WTF XD
---
Killing the enemies that drop orbs adds more time then throwing orbs at the forge, so kill a bunch of them if you’re running short of time and then toss the orbs when you have time
---
Nice try Bungie, go fix the meta instead of circle jerking on reddit.
---
If a Hunter has a charged melee, and someone is too close to throw the knife, the stab should be overpowered and cause a burn over time. If it’s a smoke melee that is charged, the stab should do damage and drop smoke too. This change would be competitive with Titan’s shoulder charge and with the Warlock’s Handheld Supernova. 
---
Are you Iron Man?
---
Can you do this solo or do you need a team?
---
Nightfalls can be done solo if I feel like waiting 35 minutes for their god awful Guided Game system lol. Raids can’t be done solo at all. Many of the other activities aren’t fun solo whatsoever, like Gambit and Crucible. Strikes become incredibly repetitive incredibly fast and I’d rather kill myself than continue replaying the story missions. 
---
Go with your favorite auto rifle (I used Breakneck, but any will do...SUROS Regime is nice) and an auto shotgun (the EP one is great, but the year one Hawthorn’s Field-Forged Shotgun is excellent as well). As for the power, I prefer a machine gun, but any big hitter will do.  As for armor, be sure to have Heavy finder and your power weapon choice’s Reserves.
---
From there, use the AR on the little adds, punch the dogs, and use the shotgun on the bigger adds. If you have an exotic armor piece that grants you Super energy, feel free to use your Super in the 2nd phase (only if you are sure you can get it back for the Boss phase).
---
For the Boss fight, hang out by the cliff where he drops, use cover, do not let his shield drop and blow him up!
---
Finally and most importantly, rally a flag somewhere on EDZ before you start. Every single time.
---
Literally the EXACT same situation as me
---
Good luck my dude
---
They used to be, and I stopped playing D1 afterwards because of that.
---
MOM GET THE CAMERA

Mom get the camera!

Are others experiencing significant FPS drops in Forsake content? I’ve done 2/6 Barons, 10-12 Public Events, and some mindless wandering. 
---
My frames have been dropping in an inconsistent manner. Usually stable around 90-100. In Forsaken I dip from 85 down to 55. Anyone else? 
---
I'd rather it have modifiers, like invasion modifiers and mob modifiers. Same basic premise though.
---
Hmu if I want a free Luna carry, my dude 
---
That’s awesome, so they’re the only ones to be able to get that ghost shell?
---
well, sometimes you just gotta hit the kids and yeet
---
Stick together in the cave area, a well with lunafication boots for the boss is perfect, run with sleeper, whisper, or thunderlord (thunderlord’s the best). Also rally a public event banner before you go in will give you full ammo, and try to not use your heavy until the boss (always have someone damaging the boss or his shields will come back up) 
---
No, to each their own.  Use what you're güd with
---
Hmm interesting idea
---
Not as good as d1
---
Complete daily Ada bounties.  Just keep doin  them every day and you'll get one. 
---
Were you even paying attention to all of it? 
---
Every code had a pattern to solve the code for that specific bypass, except for level 7. They spent over 50 hours in that room running over and over again, and Gladd himself barely slept, so that he could try every possible solution that raidsecrets came up with. He stayed positive throughout the entire thing despite staying up 24+ hours a few times in a row.
---
But you’re going to recognize that he “cried like a child”. Get your BS opinion out of here man.
---
Dual speed receiver is what you will want to go with if using it in PvP however Auto Rifles are not in the best spot right now compared to what you will go up against typically in Crucible. There is little room for forgiveness when using them as compared to a Pulse Rifle like Blast Furnace. I actually find SMG's to be better in PvP over Auto Rifles. That being said there are some people who can wield them very well but I would argue that number is few.
---
Begone thot
---
It pops up when you get a bounty that involves a lost sector, regardless as to whether or not you've cleared it. 
---
So how would your idea play out in the game extensively?
---
Right now auto rifles aren’t what Bungie wants to be meta. Once they decide that auto rifles should be what everyone uses, it will be a good choice. I’ve played since the first week of D1, I’ve seen all weapon types be good and be bad.
---
Good.
---
Slow your role, I don’t use shotguns, and this isn’t a post complaining about any sort of thing. 
---
If I got wooshed, get it over with
---
Here we go again 
---
Lol yea
---
This is a major factor PS4 has more stuff than anyone else hope this dies  with Activison getting the boot
---
I agree. I'm considering next time I play visiting the skulls to buy myself a ton of tincture (I recall being able to give boughs even though I was away full on the tincture). That would take far less time to clear the things from my inventory rather than discarding.
---
I'm game to help...INMATE_0878. #WARLOCK
---
Oh yeah I forgot about Sleeper. I’ve been basically only using Whisper or Crooked Fang but yeah Sleeper is also good. 
---
That's a damn good friend.  So happy for y'all.  That just made my night!!
---
I typically only use it for Boss damage or really large groups of ads.  Might try it out after the update tomorrow and see though.
---
Ikelos SG 
---
Khakis
---
Lots of patience and finding a HC that works for you. Precision targeting gear (helms) and the the targeting weapon mods help too. I've been trying to get the ace of spades and realized that targeting helps... LOL
---
Congrats, guardian.  Well done!
---
forsaken is needed to play annual pass content 
---
I had 5000 at 1 point I just delete them now
---
Absolute mad lad but congrats to you this deserves more upvotes
---
Good to know. Working on my third now, about 38 as well. Other two are 650.
---
This is supposed to be funny?
---
Lol, that is way to much work for slightly more efficiency.
---
I got it on my last ballistic log few days ago and oh man..its my fav exotic now...
---
Yep, altho try avoid going double digits. Never know when a wipe can occur and blamo, all keys gone.
---
I literally did only the riven encounter every week on all 3 chars. You can teleport to riven by using the Wish wall
---
Congratulations! But don’t you let me see you with that shit show of a weapon in gambit (Queenbreaker)
---
Or when you excitedly gun down a fantatic using riskrunner and it just turns out to be a headless goblin.
---
Yeah I know that I used to open 4 chests at a time. What do you mean by double digits? I’m a French Canadian sorry lmao 
---
Yet here you are, in r/Destiny2. Good use of your time.
---
Only maybe lol
---
I got this with extended mag and mid/long scopes.  Not sure how I feel about it.  Fun gun I guess but not sure I want to waste my only Rampage mod on it.  ARs just feel so weak right now
---
Hahaha i just meant i don't feel safe have 10+ keys in inventory 😂 10+ = double digits whereas 1 to 9 are single digits
---
Ahhhh I though you meant that we lose all our keys when getting whipped lol
---
Don’t worry man, I got it
---
*cough* Deepest lore *cough*
---
I've sort of accepted I'm not willing to put in the time and grind to get the new exotics. My friend is hardcore as heck and isn't going to stop until he has every single item in the game. We argue a lot but we're both mostly happy and at the end of the day we're both having fun doing the raids and other activities. He just so happens to have less free time and cooler toys 
---
Yoo just got mine today as well, got to 2000 solo but had to find some competent people to communicate with for the last 100. Took me about 2 days to get but I'm glad i decided to grind for it. 
---
Dont try it alone. I went lfg and found one other person to play it. Still took us many deaths to complete it, but very worth it.
---
Try and get at least two others to join you and best of luck guardian!
---
... I actually got it on my first try... and Anarchy in my 2nd......
---
aye its pretty dope bro lol
---
Congrats !!!
---
Your gonna love it
---
Whamen aren’t video gAmes
---
I was pretty sure I will get it at my first, but if I get it, I'll be banned everywhere 
---
I feel what you’re saying. I guess my question is does the exotic perk work that often in PVP? I know you need to land a certain amount of shots but I feel like I should use faster time to kill weps instead of hoping for a perk to activate.
---
Better get to taking out her command.
---
This meme format is fucking stupid. 
---
I can't think of any dumb things I did, probably because I'm still doing them.
---
But a friend of mine was told by another friend not to skill ANYTHING with his upgrade points. So he was a level 17 Titan that didn't even have a shield.
---
When I yelled at his friend later, he denied saying anything. 
---
congrats
---
Lost Light playthrough?
---
 4 Warlocks put on sunbracers. Cheeeesseeee
---
Could you have at least picked something good when you are going to post garbage?
---
I've been going for shield disorient and rampage but that's a pretty sweet combo too. 
---
I can't pull this off because it keeps calling the match after 25ish kills.  Is there some trick to keep this from happening?
---
new disney princeses
---
There's lots of work to do guardian, you've came at a great time. Nothing but good people in this community. Welcome
---
Oof, i want those shards
---
Wow.  I never played D1, and started w forsaken.   D1  looks surprising similiar.  I wonder why they just did not expand D1, and instead create d2.  Worried investment into D2 go bye bye, for d3, and d3 not feature parity w D2.
---
You do not need this for the emblem varient "Strikes of all stripes". Mine unlocked last night after finishing the "Three and out" triumph which was the last nighfall triumph I had left. I also have all triumph's complete on the general strikes page except "Strike Specialist" which I'm on 197 / 250.
---
Heh nice
---
She googled it. 
---
It looks like a toaster
---
Now, but only if you are 600 light as the forge requires 600+
---
The pass doesn’t guarantee a year of content from the date you bought it. 
---
It’s from sept 2018 thru summer 2019. 
---
You know its not true cause none of them are half eaten.
---
Well I had already tethered the boss and his wizards and we won sooooo..... 
---
Not exclusively. 
---
No you’re misinterpreting the post lol. I know there are other modes. I love the game and the repetitive loot grind, I just fucking HATE the PvP because it’s a cancerous meta. PVP takes up a bit majority of the weekly activities you can accomplish as a solo player - which means I’m forced to progress much slower because of it. I’m asking for MORE options for weeklys and daily’s, such as maybe add weekly rewards for lost sectors and hell maybe even stuff like lore points. Maybe more rewards for Adventures since I still have little to no reason to accomplish them other than lore and the ONE weekly heroic adventure. 
---
So if I purchase the annual pass when I'm 600 light will I be able to play only this spring?
---
Why not just use the super alone? What does slamming before it do?
---
Yeah not sure of his game plan 🤔
---
Sliding shot + air assault, yes brother it can...
---
Well.. I punched a lot of cursed thralls back in the day, still do it but less frequently Xd
---
Hey man I’m on pc as well if you need some help (I’m a newb on this mission cause I haven’t done it yet) but I’ll gladly help you if you need it. Pm me for my Battle.net 
---
Alright that was a good one.
---
Wait... Really? 
---
It's okay, they don't win often. 
---
Same. Been doing ascendant challenge three times a week since the second week of forsaken. No ghost. Only thing I need for title. 
---
Same with the fkngoddamnfucking side arm from the weapon schematics from sleeper nodes on mars for wayfarer. 
---
Have you tried actually hitting it though
---
The helmet stayed on guardian
---
Destiny players destroyed by facts and bad rng
---
The helmet must never be removed
---
This is why im gaurdian 1 
---
I was trying to do something similar, but lately just went backwards with my Competitive score. I had a decent run, and then got destroyed round after round. 
---
wait, why would someone be salty in a forge? especially for such insignificant reasons...  
---
The guy evidently has some issues, don't pay attention to him
---
I laught more than i propably should when i am at work. Everyone is now looking at me.
---
That Moment when Activision decided to press Ctrl+Alt+Del 
---
😂😂😂
---
I'm quite close to the Redrix though, so I guess that's something. Now deciding if I'm going to AFK the remaining 22 Rumble matches or actually try and get super frustrated. 
---
He's right though. The majority of these memes are cringy and low-effort.  
---
CROW, GET BETTER MATERIAL
---
Wish he'd post more of the "in a nutshell" stuff.  With everything he has going on,  I doubt he'll be able to any time soon.
---
Any tips? 
---
You don't seem to understand the meme. A decent effort though.
---
i could help you, but i won't be online for the next 8 hours.
---
Once you are noticed and getting flinched, cover and switch weapons, change your position. Never attempt to peak the same lane again.
---
I do on Xbox.
---
I can confirm it's from any thunderlord, because i missed the quest but can still transfer it between characters
---
Oh geez I've actually read that peice of lore I totally did not look at it as they smashed 
---
You are also forgetting that people who attained lunas/nf last season do have the potential to be at 0 glory this season so whilst mm is screwy there is a chance you matched teams of equal glory reaping the rewards of s4. I feel like this fact is glossed over highly in these kinds of posts
---
And clearly someone wants to hear my comments because they are upvoted. So idk what to tell you snowflake. 
---
No, its not
---
I think this meme format might be the only one I'm ok with being made illegal to use. The entire subreddit is the same fucking meme lol
---
Yep same lol 
---
yes u can 
---
Now listen up, here's a story
---
About a little guy that lives in a blue world.
---
Me &amp; my Subtle Calamity with Dragonfly Spec say that bows that cause big ol' explosions are tech. 😍
---
I got it by handing in like 4-5 Ada bounties all at once 
---
Well you know, i'm a flanker.... And because the enemy will expect a flank, i flank from the front. Alone. Like a BOSS.
---
Booo look the wizards are here
---
Lol ya nobody wants to hear my comment -gets gold 🤣🤣🤣😂
---
You can't see the weapond being MW for some reason
---
I got it in 3 hours. Literally today. Been off destiny for a couple weeks. Came back to get the sniper cause of the whole shattered throne part. Had no issues. I guess it boils down to RNG and having an active clan to help. 
---
u/destiby_thememe
---
You have to obtain 7 key fragments, which get turned in to one Blue Cache Key by Ana Bray, which then allows you to open the chest. 
---
I was so happy when I looked i to my inventory and there was one there except it was the one to complete 50 ignitions and it took forever and I still needed to fit a shattered throne in before reset. I did it but nearly had to pull an all nighter to do it.
---
God. So accurate. May you have all the upvotes 
---
You get key fragments for doing heroic missions. Make sure to get the purple thing from Ana. Once you have 7 click the arrow to go to the right and craft one
---
Damn you murdered those potatoes  
---
Whaman don’t exist
---
I actually do have 7 how do I craft one. Does Ana do it?
---
Rampage is not outright better than trench barrel. In a boss DPS situation, rampage makes no difference whatsoever, unless you want to waste bullets and time killing a few adds around which will decrease your overall DPS anyway. 
---
If you're using a shotty to clear adds, it's not that helpful either because you don't use a shotty for add clear a whole lot, stuff like hand cannons and pulses are just way more consistent and always have ammo. 
---
Rampage is a decent perk for shotties but I'd say trench barrel is better the vast majority of the time anyway.
---
Pretty sure most folks want to slam EVERY warlock From behind mid Nova Warp to stop the slaughter in PVP, not just Ikora.
---
At the risk oc coming out as super toxic, fuck no. I don't want potatoes on my team when I'm playing Crucible.
---
In pvp not between consoles and pc, but it might be difficult to get Sony to agree to it
---
Yes, but only once a week.
---
It’s not though.  You ignored numerous examples to get there.  
---
Nothing happened to you. You’re over dramatic because you didn’t hit your own expectations. 
---
Marry someone who knows how to use google? That laugh wasn’t genuine and she immediately unmatched so she thought it was stupid so 
---
After warmind you do the questline to get sleeper, i think you have to complete one mission (if i remember right) after you get the ikelos hand cannon,i think the quest is called data recover or something like that but it should reward you with some key fragments (they will be green) in your inventory and you have to fuse them to make a cache code, i think you need 7 or 4 of them to make one, and you can get them from pretty much any warmind activity, but your first nightfall every week always gives enough to make one.
---
Yup
---
Actually you do heroic/nightfall stuff on Mars to get 7 fragments. Turn those in to Ana and you get an encrypted key (blue). Then you have to do 7 levels of EP to turn that blue key to purple. (You can complete any 7 levels i.e. do level 1 7 times) THEN you can open the chest after completing level 7. 
---
Breakneck is lovely though. 
---
Finally got everything on my Warlock a few weeks ago, then the forge ones day one, Jotun yesterday, raid sparrow a week or two ago... but will never, ever see Anarchy. Having all but one fucking sucks because it's my only reason to log in and I keep going for it because I'm OCD.
---
I do need a bunch on my Titan and Hunter but it's hard playing only for exotics, knowing the content you're doing it effectively pointless outside of hoping one eventually drops. This is why I wish there were more armor perks and that you still had a way to grind out gear improvements, that "I'm always improving" feeling is something I really miss and as a result everything feels kinda pointless atm. 
---
Have you completed the forsaken camping 
---
B U T, We can throw ourselves, ayyyyye??
---
Sad fact: Most productive thing you have done today xD
---
If you watch the clip you would see he had a powerful frame on him and armour dropped aswell so I'm pretty sure its just tied to the powerfully frames/ weekly &amp; daily bounties.
---
Izanagi......
---
The EP weapons drop from the boss and not the chest, I got a masterworked 380 cape with no perks from the chest so I'm assuming the chest Is basically meaningless
---
Next season will bring a new gambit experience. 
---
Polygon never have anything good to say about Destiny, it's extremely biased.
---
Of course PVP would still be one platform only, cross-play would only apply to PVE
---
The majority of shattered throne is 580 I think, so being 650 will make no difference as opposed to being 630.
---
The only reason whisper outdamages darci is because of theoretical unlimited ammo. Dps-wise, darci beats out whisper.
---
Indeed. Aside from the Armour guaranteeing you a full set in the first five weeks (of EP armour), it is indeed useless. Even more useless than the Blind Well chest. 
---
Majority of the time you're fighting adds.  not bossss.  trench barrel is terrible for ads,  punch to activate already does a significant portion of the damage then its a 50% buff for 3 shots only.  Rampage needs no punch,  gets to 68%, and is extendable for as many adds as you can find.  
---
Bring a Trench Barrel shotty to an ad wave and let's see who can clear them quicker,  I understand its application on bosses which is albeit overrated but if you think a punch activated 3 shot 50% buff is better than a continuously extendable 68% buff that doesn't require a punch,  you're loopy mate. 
---
I would fist bump you but if two Titans bumo fists, Im afraid the world would implode. Eh, at least the Dreaming City would come back in 3 weeks.
---
Holy shit good going 
---
*looks at his two-time fox and ophidia spathe*
---
Must be nice...
---
Also check out the other games I had tonight when I played, I had more but I only got pictures of these :P
---
[33 Kills](https://imgur.com/a/I5Ijh7Z)

[25 Kills](https://imgur.com/a/3RELC7V)

It looked pretty average to me until I saw the guardians defeated nice 
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah I really love invading haha
---
Surprisingly, that's the buid I use for Gambit
---
Honestly? Even for pve i dont think its a good idea. I mean sure, increasing the population is always good, but damn, I can see the toxic kids raging because of console aim. You'd need to reimplement text chat too
---
 I'll trade them both for Oath Keepers
---
My inventory is not my own.
---
DO I LOOK LIKE I KNOW WHAT A JPEG IS I JUST WANT A PICTURE OF A GOD DAMMED HOT DOG
---
Looks sweet
---
Can you join my team?? I've got a guy here.  
---
Lmao, can your ghost heal a burn that bad?
---
I just think he's too much of a mary sue. The first couple episodes were pretty good. He was a beta tester and knows his way around. Because he plays solo he isn't slowed down by others and can rise in levels pretty quickly (even though group play would still be advisable in his situation.)
---
But he is so universally liked by most characters, and all his enemies are batshit crazy maniacs for the most part. Then, I think at some point he goes and defeats a raid boss solo... . Often enough it also felt like he was one of the very few people who understand how a game works, like that red guild that tries to assassinate him during the pina episode. "Numbers! What is this witchcraft?"
---
I think what I really disliked about the series is that the core plot only ever lasted half a season, and the rest was filled up with alfheim, which just felt super rushed and didn't have the original premise of being stuck in a game that can actually kill you. The first two halves of the first two seasons were okay though.
---
It's amazing. Anytime the Mummy talked about in our friend group that live is always without fail the first to be said.
---
Ah, interesting. Which video was this? I was actually just getting ready to catch up on some Byf today.
---
I just happen to have the best luck. Back to back exotics weekly and last weekend I got about 5 the on before that I got like 7.  I have every armor piece I could have for my warlock and every gun that isn’t through a quest
---
How about getting to 650 than infusing gear with good perks. 
---
Also Level advantage matters in gambit, pve and some pvp modes. 
---
What video settings do you have? It seems like you can actually see when using Chaos Reach
---
Sao and ggo were great. Alfheim 1 was ok. Alfheim 2 was shit. Havent started s3. But yeah, SAO was the best part of SAO
---
I'm only missing geomags with my warlock and the last exotic engram I got gave me a dupe...
---
Your a special type of guardian if only when your ghost revived you it would fully revive your brain too and not just a peanut portion 
---
YES
---
Still got a few in there buddy, third times the charm I guess
---
Just FYI, only one of 40 eggs cannot be collected solo as it requires to kill Morgeth in the Last Wish.  
---
Timegated eggs are located in shattered throne and each ascendant challenge.
---
That’s not what I meant at all.
---
Looks like you and I have a date...with destiny
---
This is literally me.
---
Explain
---
But it peaked while I was at work! I just want to eat weird alien body parts with the Drifter like everyone else
---
Reddit is not google
---
But you guys can dodge roll in all the different directions no? And aerial is very useful, paired with the right weapons. I get melted by hunters most of the time due to them flying all over the shop. 
---
Was....was that Scathelocke? that gun was my jam for most of year one. 
---
He says some relevant joke/fact about the enemy you are going to face. That's the actual point.
---
Just gonna take time, and hopefully not much longer as I am slowly transitioning into being a PC only gamer, and once that happens if cross-save isn't a thing for Destiny then I may end up abandoning the franchise and that would be pretty damn sad tbh
---
Butt towel, pee bib
---
Thanks! My first post on this sub after lurking for months
---
Oh yeah I guess it is, still it is well past it's halfway point, maybe even if 3/4 of it's lifecycle
---
But soon there will be no more exclusives, so then it would be fine. it would be minium implementation next September because of that.
---
posted here because r/destiny does not allow posts with images :(
---
LMAO!
---
I agree. I personally don't have any need for crossplay or cross save since all my stuff is on xbox but it should be a thing because I know plenty of people who could use it.
---
I basically just made this post because it doesn't seem like a lot of the community know that Sony have opened up on crossplay etc.
---
This shit right here is stressing me out so hard ':&gt;
---
I've been playing all week and the fuckin' eye didn't appear
---
*almost*
---
I think if your above 15 when they hit 75 it's not a mercy.  Maybe the decent players on the loosing team quit not too long after... 
---
Warlock Master Race
---
Don’t
---
That's a thing... Huh, I'll see.
---
Got this two days ago.
---
It works.
---
Damn, was hoping it was as simple as that. Do you happen to have that on another character? Maybe there's a glitch that only allows 1 per account?
---
Just spitballing some ideas hoping something helps. Best of luck man!
---
Alright I just suck. Will try again!
---
If you're an Awoken character, you'll find all the Awoken except Mara refer to you as cousin. They've been doing so since we entered the Dreaming City.
---
You get slightly different dialogue throughout the Dreaming City quests as an Awoken than humans or exos. Some quite enlightening, too.
---
Nope this is the first character, I only just bought the dlc
---
D3 is not going to be released this year. Later this year there will be the "comet" expansion for D2. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
D3 is believed to be released in 2020. 
---
With the current split of Bungie and Activision, this could maybe change a lot. 
---
But it tingles 
---
That’s pretty sweet dude. What was that hand cannon?
---
I gave up trying to get them and started on my backlog.  I was getting too frustrated. 
---
I know man, that was my assumption when it was announced to be a 10 year adventure, akin to how WOW works on pc. 
---
IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT A WOMAN, YOU'RE NOT THROWING ENOUGH GRENADES
---
You're wrong, simple as that. 
---
The stock looks like a skeleton key. Hence needing keys to unlock the box!
---
My pp bronze now
---
You're wrong, simple as that! 
---
It's Orimund's Anvil, the Iron Banner rifle based on the same frame as Scathelocke. This clip was from a couple months ago when I was just getting around to levelling up my warlock so I was still using my year 1 gear.
---
I've done it almost 100 times and it was always fun. 
---
Warlocks are the worst, they were awesome when they had self res but now eh
---
I only infuse armor duplicates - yes this means the power grind takes longer but I also play different sets so it is okay. 
---
Never happened to me. 
---
That maze while playing hunter and going invisible was so much fucking fun. 
---
Situationally yes but I mostly by myself so I go shards
---
 I know man, that was my assumption when it was announced to be a 10 year adventure, akin to how WOW works on pc. 
---
It’s a crutch.
---
thanks heaps :)
---
👌
---
That's crazy because what about the casual players that won't try it many times or look out Reddit and will just give up.
---
thanks so much you're a lifesaver
---
speaking as a dirty casual that took ages to get his ace of spades and still dreams with getting malfeasance; is destiny 2 too much casual for you guys? because if destiny 3 is more hardcore than this i migth have a problem...
---
Its there way to get you back. Then they gonna fuck you again with no lube or kiss
---
Huh, never noticed that either!
---
Only two armor pieces left, but i feel ill get the phoenix one last.
---
Glad I could help! Nobody needs toxicity in a video game! That's where we go to escape lol. AINT NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THAT!
---
What's hardcore about destiny? I feel like it's very casual except comp pvp and perhaps doing a new raid. 
---
Speedrunners would like a word with you, also any raid ever cause every team always wants a well, Gambit with choas reach and risk runner build, PVP with Nova warp. hunters are a very niche class imo
---
Idk bungie just needs to fix the hit box but if you shoot it a lot it will work eventually 
---
Sagira
---
My computer broke down the 3rd week of thunderlord and I didnt get it fixed until after it went into the loot pool
---
It was a joke. I don’t give two shits what you use.
---
I prefer your color design more than the ugly original.
---
Me, a Titan main, IRL.
---
It went from strength to strength when The Taken King expansion came out. 
---
thaks , we'll try later when we'll regroup. Just another thing , is the well of radiance a problem for the symbols on the ground if i use it?? or the little fire damage will not hit them??
---
thanks , i'll let you know if we'll do it or not!
---
Best way is to load in to Leviathan, run down to make the enemies spawn then go back up top.  There are always two phalynx that spawn in with the enemies.  Get your 4 crits on their shields then hit a full health red bar.  You should be able to do two rounds this way,then wait for the phalynx to spawn again and start over.  Won't take long to finish.
---
My buddy has gotten shards THREE TIMES. I haven’t had a single forsaken armor drop for my hunter. All hail RNGesus, even if he is a cruel bastard
---
I wish Cayde was my father....
---
A well should not be the issue, but I'd make sure to get all adds down before a puzzle even starts.
---
Yeah, they're from Tess, I have some and don't frequently spend bright dust so I'll have to start running them I guess
---
Sorry, I got excited - I meant aesthetically. My favorite \*looking\* gun, lol
---
And the zoom on this gun is incredible. A little too much.
---
My girlfriend just replied with "Sh!t...they are on to me!" 
---
I only invaded because the opposite team had their primeval after I had done 2x15motes and teammates barely had 10each. 
---
If I didn't who're the invaders...www like never have won that single round. 
---
Was lucky enough to saw a post that suggest me to save rare black armory bounties weeks prior. 
---
Re-installed the game yesterday and played one comp game without any problems . Loading into 2nd game and this happens yet again
---
Use oathkeepers with le monarch. It's a beast in pvp and pve. Unlimited hold time, which stays as a poison arrow is epic.
---
I have all hunter exotics forsaken or otherwise so I'll keep my mouth shut on the main topic
---
I love it. 
---
I finally caved and joined a PUG to complete my rare bounty on Monday. Then got the final Mystery Box quest and had to run it again...
---
*while scratching neck and looking around nervously* 
---
"Comon xur. Buuuuuddy, You've GOT to have at least ONE knucklehead radar left......right?"
---
&gt; Yeah, that is a big deal. You act like 2 weeks is meaningless
---
Its not a big deal.  You can find other things to do for two weeks, and your game won't be ruined because you have to wait to get the burden quest done.  Yes, by most accounts its a fun gun....is it like not getting Sleeper, TL, QB or Whisper...no, not even close.
---
&gt; I'm not living in ideals. Everything about the game just was ideal for me, except for that quest.
---
uhhh.....
---
&gt; Idk why you are trolling me. 
---
I'm not, you've asked me to explain my point, I have and you ignored it, and in the process you backed over your own point by agreeing, and then the next post disagreeing.  Who's trolling again?
---
Well if you are looking for something active and sweaty, drop me a line, we’ll talk. Congratulations and mad respect on the achievement, well deserved.
---
Walking vigil. Dreaming city HC
---
People come on here talking about micros, dont think that's an issue with this game. What can you buy that isn't just cosmetic crap?
---
RIP my data plan. Plz save screenshots as .jpg
---
I'll get this pinned as soon as one of the other pins come down!
---
Okay, I'll see if I can do that today. Other than that any recommendations on the weapon frame to get from Ada?
---
Making him tonights biggest loser!
---
It's so detailed, I ended up looking at it for like 15mins
---
Xur has to buy his own wares because his RNG sucks, making him tonight’s biggest loser!
---
I'll definitely have a look at cammycakes later, thanks again
---
thanks😂
---
PLAY PIANO FOREVER GUARDIAN!
---
Hey man I'd help you out if you'd like, only thing is me and my buds are mostly around the 3000 mark. Add Black_wolf0331 if you want.
---
I wasn’t replying to you. I was talking to Mikey. I must have clicked reply under your comment by accident.  
---
After not playing for like 2 months I got queensbreaker, one eye mask and trinity in 2 days  
---
It's very short, you need to solve the riddle, and then do a forge activation in each forge while using all black armory equipment (weapons and armor).
---
Where does one check
---
It was early this morning. Around 6 CST. I had just never seen it before. It was a little eerie.
---
Oooof!! Sick burn :)
---
For real! I got mine and got it masterworked during Festival of the Lost and it's a beast in the Volundr Forge. You can have your super ready before the end of the first wave if you're quick HOOH.
---
Really awesome, man!
---
That Warmind piece has to be my favorite of all D2.
---
Don’t worry man I’m in the top 8%
---
www.wastedondestiny.com
---
Yeah, how do you check that? :D
---
You know how many guns are in destiny?
---
I wish they would just roll out with one game then just add to it kind of like WoW.  Do stat squish when needed. Add more planets or a galaxy for DLC. Just imo though
---
Xur has has trash for exotics, especially for titans, for weeks and I hate it.
---
Is this a rules post or a tips and tricks post?
---
Updoot to pin at top
---
dont worry i dont care about them, otherwise you'd find reposts on my page
---
Titan, yes!!! I’ll be Wayfarer when I get home from work and knock out those last 3 heroic adventures!
---
It's the only game I enjoy ! Man you must be over 1k!
---
Fair enough 
---
Okay, I'll look into it, was originally thinking about getting the auto rifle.
---
XXXX has invaded
---
XXXX has casted Spectral Blades
---
[me on the highest point i can find in the middle of the map](https://media1.tenor.com/images/6353ea57b46e24ddea8399c86a1fbfdd/tenor.gif?itemid=5437246)
---
The rng gods still didn’t help me with the drop though:( now for another 3 weeks.
---
The nine will not have it.
---
Oh its beautiful i miss this thing :'(
---
Used to be my favorite SMG before the shoulder charge/shotgun bonanza started . Might give this one a spin again. 
---
Exotics? What are those?
---
/s
---
Made me realize I  need a life
---
Destiny is life.... 
---
If the price of Forsaken drops down, I'd recommend getting it. If you are a pvp player, most of the best weapons are forsaken exclusives and if you are into pve, dreaming city has a lot to do and of course there are the raids. Plus, you get some new, fun subclasses. I waited until it went down to $30 and I'm pretty happy with my purchase of it. Made me enjoy the game more.
---
The base game + first two expansions kept me entertained until I got to 380 and got all the y1 exotics. Then it was basically just crucible all the time which got kind of old. 
---
That Crota looks dope!
---
It’s iron banner, not comp. I was on a team with a 20 (yes a twenty). It gave me a chance to carry the kinderguardian to victory and powerful drops. 
---
He got one kill and I was proud of him for it. 
---
Weak players aren’t slowing your progress, you are boosting their progress. 
---
No corrupted nightfall!!?!?!? WTF!
---
Even better, I bet she draws anime Tintin and Asterix and Obelix as JoJo characters.
---
:(
---
How is sun shot guaranteed? Point me in the right direction?
---

I didn't whine. I posted a clip that I deemed to be stupid. And no, they really can't. Go ahead and watch gameplay of both with good players. Oh, and did I mention no console players even cleared last wish in 24 hours? Every team that did was ~~on PC~~ **a content streamer**. And the world first for every raid that has released post-launch of PC for D2 has been on PC. Care to know why? Because ~~players~~ **streamers are** on Pc ~~are better~~, period. Also, you were the one that went on a rant about nova warp, I didn't even complain and the title of the clip is a sarcastic meme. Anyways, enjoy your console experience. I bet you have time to write all of these comments while you're waiting on your inventory to pull up.
---
FTFY
---
No u
---
If I remember correctly, you get it from just playing the Red War story from Ikora.
---
And I’m still missing Zen Meteor in D1
---
Huh?
---
Seriously? Considering Iron Banner doesn’t require dlc that’s not even an option for some people. Inconsiderate much?
---
Last week Bungie manually changed the nightfalls to include Will of the Thousands and The Corrupted. I would not expect that to affect the nightfall reset time this week, which should be at the same time every other weekly thing resets. 
---
Appreciate it!
---
I don’t think it’ll change. Celestial will remain a single, high damage shot just like it is now. 
---
Let’s discuss Iron Banner bounties.
---
Lightbearer - you’re gonna get your super shot down at  260. A lot.
---
Iron in the blood - thankfully reduced from 30 to 15 matches so you’ll only be getting your a** handed to you for 15 games 😂
---
Shine on - How you gonna get orbs with no kills?
---
Iron Victory - Depending on others to carry you through the crucible because at 260 you can’t contribute Jack sh*t to the team you’re f*cking over.
---
To be precise - snow balls chance in hell of completing this one.
---
All in a Weeks work - used to be 250 kills, now 150. Not a chance. Even if you could hit the side of a barn.
---
So there’s a participation bounty you’ll get and the other times you’ll be hoping for a random drop of gear that isn’t a blue at the end of the match and a smattering of tokens, all the while f*cking over your team mates for god knows how many matches having your a** handed to you over and over.
---
Seriously doubt you would get the bullet back with celestial equipped. That would be broken as all hell. 
---
Getting in on PC was even easier 
---
It'll be nice for the Whisper quest, too. Just change the elemental type between rooms and wreck everything.
---
&gt;I thought it could only drop when you were completing a powerful frame?
---
There are a handful of players who get it without a powerful frame, or no frames at all. It is far less common, so many people do not think it is possible. 
---
Hmm. Id say it wouldnt work because the way they made it sound in the notes was you have until your super runs out. So if you can get kills you get bullets back until the 5 seconds or so that the super lasts you can continue killing. But in the nighthawk case after you shoot your 1 bullet the super ends so id say you still only get 1 shot.
---
*Nova warps behind you*
---
I think this person means "subclass," I am not sure where they got "focus" from. It might be because they play the game in a different language. 
---
This hit home 😭
---
It'd be interesting to have a feature where  you can double tap the dismantle button to mark an item as 'trash'. Then, holding dismantle over an item marked 'trash' prompts a "Dismantle all items marked?" Confirm, boom, each item is then dismantled, giving exactly what it normally would if you held dismantle on it solo.   
---
Sounds pretty simple, no? 
---
ah, ty
---
feels the same with riskrunner
---
Lol...wut?
---
I checked mine not too long ago. I thought mine was bad at 890 hours. 
---
That's the spirit. Folks forget they were kinder guardians once themselves.
---
My thoughts as well. I use what's needed for bounties or what ever super I'm  feeling. Never have any issues. 
---
Yeah, I ment subclass. In German it‘s called Focus. 
---
Sorry for the unclear writing. 
---
ah shit i’m on pc :(
---
but send me a clip of the cop boss fight n ill make it work (as long as u don’t die)😂
---
Nobody gives credit like u/Franconis folks, believe me.
---
Titans are Chads confirmed
---
So it seems that in this forge it's good to have one person snipe with a scout or bow on the top where you spawn after dying to keep the snipers busy kill the non-servitor blue guys to get time on the clock and once the exploding shanks spawn the people on the ground kite them around while the support sniper up top pops them as they are being kited. The people on the ground just keep killing the servitors until the shanks spawn, nobody throws balls yet until the shanks spawn and just keep killing blue guys to put time on the clock. Once the shank round is done then everyone comes down and just throws balls. It worked out really well on the 3 runs we did yesterday. Of course this requires everyone working together...
---
Didn't read the first half properly.  
---
Thought I had a stroke for the second half . lol
---
Ah man. Bummer. PS4 player here. Sorry I couldn’t help ya bud. 
---
You have to wonder about them sometimes 
---
For my post I should of put something like: my friends shunned me for having 3 characters level 650, now they all quit playing because of me. Let’s see if reddit cares! 
---
Any idea on what Brother Vance's prophecies are this week? Been months and I still haven't gotten verse 7 to appear.
---
Excellent work! I miss D1 exotics.
---
nope, no frames in inventory
---
Good luck getting anywhere near a warp
---
or do what i do...
---
warlock with well of radiance + phoenix protocol + riskrunner
---
1. go to the broken staircase
---
2. pop rift and hold the shoot button
---
3. pop well of radiance when available
---
4. keep shooting blues nonstop
---
5. ?????
---
6. profit!
---
check out the DestinySherpa sub....awesome sherpa's always looking to help pop your cherry
---
They need a random "reflect shield"  on some of the primes;  would add a bit of comedy to this  
---
Whoopsie
---
What are the barrel perks ? Outlaw would be good for a precision frame shotgun. 
---
What system are you on?
---
congrats guardian well done.
---
Lol so long as you have blade barrage, a super that can shut down any super without a counter, I won't feel bad at all about using OEM to dick the neutral game if i can't win the super game
---
Barrel perks are: Smoothbore or Smallbore
---
Maybe connect the silver directly to dad's bank account, and make it an LMG instead of handcanon, give it a very high rpm. Some low accuracy so that people end up spraying it.
---
What did it come out to after the colossal discount ? 🤐
---
You want choke barrel and accurised rounds for full cancer
---
I misread this as three partners and a kid....  smh
---
Finally got my set on Sunday, can confirm 100%.
---
I really haven't messing with master working armor. Other than weps really haven't put mods in armor either.
---
Still struggling on curse breaker for ghost and ship, though in regards to last wish I made off like a bandit, got the sparrow and ship on one run just need the bow
---
Pve &amp; music. Nothing is more nostalgic than doing whisperer of the worm an escalation protocol. I also enjoy just sitting in space listen to the soundtracks. 
---
Read that in Shaxx's voice
---
No, in OP's picture. There's the Sunshot exotic and the Waking Vigil legendary
---
Beautiful keep up the good work makes me remember the good old days
---
Change the barrel perk. More projectile spread sucks if you want to deliver a packed shot to the head.
---
Of you’re checking each other’s symbols I couldn’t tell you
---
I regret not getting one. I have all the OG raid shirts in d1. my favorite is my crota with glow in the dark eye plasma.
---
Is that a PC thing? Skull fort seems relatively unused on console 
---
I see what you did there 😏
---
I am using chaos reach now. I also just got the dreaded venture so I’m thinking I’ll try that to replace queenbreaker. I have never used that weapon yet though ha, adding waking vigil hand cannon in the second slot and I guess the colony as my power? Idk I feel like I don’t have the best options at the moment 😂 
---
[removed]
---
Favorite Destiny weapon of all time
---
what do you mean horrible quality this is high quality kills
---
What's a good roll? I got the curated one.
---
Okie dokie. 
---
I wonder if we will ever be able to kill that big taken balls thing
---
$30.40ish lol. That’s cost plus tax, and 2 day shipping.
---
It's like if the Breakneck evolved
---
As a D2 only player, this gun looks sick af and the ability to have high amounts of ammo at the cost of health sounds dope when shooting from afar.
---
I just realized the people that stoped playing destiny are the people that died in the red legion attack
---
You win for the day.
---
Quickly became my favourite bow. Have fun with her.
---
ooh, very nice :)
---
After
---
I won't even use shotguns unless they have auto-loader.
---
545 hours on my Hunter, jeez I need to play something else.
---
Top reasons why crossplay isn’t good 1:
---
the worst part is when you go into comp with all randoms your team regular and the other team is straight wavespliter when you know if they were not using free kill mode you could take them
---
In a way, it’s kind of like the Dark Souls games. The point at which you stop playing is the point at which your character dies... In a way. 
---
T A H I T I 
---
Ah, thanks!
---
 It a single one 
---
Got another one today
---
I wanna see the lewd side of that pillow
---
https://i.imgur.com/A8IzrRv.png
---
Lol, I did the exact same thing. 
---
It would be just like how D2 first came out. When shotguns required heavy ammo...
---
constantly... I travel to the tower... DC... I go to titan... DC... tangled shore? DC... sometimes it doesn't fully DC  
---
I'm in the PNW maybe it's the area I live in? didn't happen until about three days ago
