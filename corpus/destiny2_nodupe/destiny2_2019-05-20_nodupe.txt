I don‚Äôt mind it (especially during forest) but if you go ahead don‚Äôt be an idiot and get killed where the team gets wiped.

---
Keep going! You can look on the d2 companion for sherpas and get help there!
---
Recluse is literally better and legendary
---
Because D1 was objectively better probably?
---
Destiny fits better with star wars. Look at Solo. So mcu shared symbolism. The helmet of the raider leader. Her weapon. The sword dryden vos uses that looks like "it stared back" and he has these heat knives that look like blade barage knives.
---
Male hunter? Wack
---
The sad thing is, D2 actually does, but it's only in the blue quality weapons. You can find the Vision of Confluence style scouts for example. I sure wish we could get legendary varients of the blues, some look INCREDIBLE
---
That's a pretty shitty sentiment. If your team is playing 'bad', maybe sweat a bit and see if you can't carry them across the line. 
---

---
Sometimes you get a bad team. See it through or quit, maybe. It's a bit of a baby move to throw your toys and just not try. 
---
In this guy's case: If he was such a 'pro-strats gamer', he should have been able to open his backpack and carry the whole damn team, no matter how bad they were playing. If NOT, maybe quit the bitchin' and play the match the best he could like a proper guardian.
---
I've never heard of Nadir, Cassoid, Crux &amp; Lomar
---
Do they have any weapons in game or are they only in the lore?
---
That caused me so much pain to watch. That poor team.
---
Lol how much did your Not Forgotten cost, I can tell from the gameplay you didn‚Äôt get it legitimately
---
Cassoid make Telesto.
---
my name are braeden too :)
---
Orpheus makes us look thicc
---
Play another match, or change characters and change back.
---
How could one possibly take this seriously
---
not that i can't get a team, I can get one easy, it's just time I don't have
---
I mean, strikes are pretty much braindead. Even if both teammates run ahead no one should have a problem clearing ads and catching up. Maybe if strikes had actual teamwork mechanics and not just clear ads and run from point A to point B then people would actually play and not speedrun them.

Some ppl don't understand the achievement , but there's a lot of ppl who have still never done a raid. I did 1 raid about a year ago, and I'm pretty sure it was just part of a raid. Like getting a checkpoint or something.

Dude, im hard of hearing and ive been wanting to do raids forever!  I met a guy in general play and he helped me through something, shattered throne i think and recommended i check out his clan.  
---
Ive done several raids with them.  They were patient and helped me through the raids despite my handicap.
---
Some people are lousy and some are great.  If they lose their shit and berate you... so what? Leave and find another group.  There are plenty of good people willing to help.
---
I absolutely love it for PvE, but in crucible I fucking hate it. I feel like if you use it in crucible you're a trash player. I will however give it a pass for iron burden. For people trying to get to 2500 kills for the emblem it's a god send. But if I see people using it outside of that PvP event I lose respect for them.
---
That's general grievous
---
I legit have never gotten the perk for this exotic to work üòî
---
Honestly? Not me. I was top 4% time spent in game according to wastedondestiny.com. Fell to 5% this season. I spent 2 weeks starting Prime/Reckoning and... STOPPED. My vault has been full since before Black Armory started. I freed space for BA/SotP gear. But I got to this season and saw 180 new pieces of armor, that Solstice of Heroes showed us could have been 15 pieces. Because I have a ton of gear pieces that are gone forever due to events/eververse, that I can never reclaim from collections because of Random Rolls, I don't really WANT new gear. I hit 700 on 2/3 chars and passed 690 on the third. Got some revelry gear... Stopped playing because I HAVE NO ROOM FOR ALL THE GEAR. Especially since its relevance ended the day Revelry did. There were 30 pieces of armor. I didn't seek them out because I didn't have room. Until collections is revamped to include claiming Y2 gear, new gear is the devil.
---
Midnight coup though
---
A what?
---
I don't like reskins, and you don't know how cars work.
---
Variety in gun models is a good thing. It's only eye candy, but so what? Your guns take up a significant area of your screen anyway. You're just Bungie apologist using weird in-game logic to justify what's obviously just a cost-cutting measure for development. This blatant bias in favor of the status quo is tired and lacking in imagination.
---
If Bungie were to just re-skin Destiny 2 by changing the box art,  you'd buy it all over again wouldn't you?
---
I got mine without using it. And by the end I wanted to murder anyone who was. I'm so glad it's over. That was not fun. Why do I have to be such a weird completionist? The gun (rebuke) isn't even good. It's going straight into the vault never to be touched again. Same with broadsword. What a ridiculous quest for such a trash gun.
---
I didn't try that one yet heard it was good
---
Yeah it's just the armor that is but fuckjbg ugly also we got more updates through the year on gear
---
If I'm coming off as wishing things we're easier to obtain, my apologies. That's not what I was trying to convey. I am saying, there should be two routes. Both equally painful to complete. One is the shorter but more glorious path, while the other is the super long and tedious path. Whichever is more appealing, kind of pick your poison type deal. Hell, they can even give it a different skin design and different name.
---
I would also say that the grind can be applied to PvE as well, without a #of matches required. ie number of kills with certain weapon types, and it can be a rediculous amount in any certain activity. For example (picking random high number) with effort, I can get 8000 kills in strikes in a month, then say multiply by 2, and it is now 16,000 in strikes required for this new weapon. On top of that, every death in every activity (besides PvP), will drop progress percentage. 
---
Just saying both are possible. There can be two paths for PvE &amp; PvP.
---
It reminds me of when the colony first came out and it was all over the crucible. I still get a cold shiver down my spine when I hear it.

Each class has their own subclass that caters for  a  certain role in a team, so I‚Äôll go over them individually.
---
The Titan subclasses:
---
The titan class ability is a deployable shield. You can choose between a tall barricade, or a smaller one that reloads your weapons while you stand behind it.
---
Striker is the most ‚ÄòTitan‚Äô of all titan subclasses, being about throwing yourself at the enemy. Your body is a weapon, you don‚Äôt need anything else apart from your fists.
---
Sunbreaker is all about hammers. You can throw exploding fire hammers, smack enemies with smaller hammers, or pull out a massive hammer and play whack-a-mole with the enemy‚Äôs face.
---
The sentinel subclass revolves around shields. You can pull out a massive bubble shield to protect your allies from all harm, become a moving wall that your teammates can shoot through, or become a low budget Captain America.
---
Hunter Subclasses:
---
The hunter class ability is a dodge that can either reload your weapons, or refresh your melee ability cooldown. (Nightstalker dodges make you turn invisible temporarily)
---
Arcstrider, the hunter version of striker. Does the same sort of thing, but acts more like a martial artist than Hulk.
---
Gunslinger is the space cowboy of Destiny 2. You get to pull out a revolver made of fire, which you can use to melt bosses or opposing guardians. Alternatively you can trade your gun in for a storm of flaming, explosive knives.
---
Nightstalker is the stealthy subclass of Destiny 2, since it‚Äôs the only one with built in invisibility. Nightstalkers can lay down traps, stalk the battlefield while invisible, fire black hole arrows, and run around invisible with blades.
---
Warlock Subclasses:
---
The Warlock class ability summons a rift that can heal allies or boost their damage.
---
Dawnblade is an aerial based subclass, which lets you rain down fire and hell upon your opponents. Alternatively you rain down healing and damage buffs upon your allies, with your super being a giant rift that heals and buffs damage.
---
Voidwalker is about explosions. And teleportation. What else could you need?
---
Stormcaller is about lightning, whether you‚Äôre being emperor palpatine, or unleashing a giant kamehameha blast.
---
Hope that helps, don‚Äôt be surprised if you see any spelling mistakes or I leave something out.
---
Here I was trying to sparrow to the top like normal, when you can just do this
---
I basically only do Sherpa raids cause my anxiety of fucking the encounter is too much, so glad I found a clan with great sherpas that don‚Äôt mind explaining. And people already mentioned it, but r/DestinySherpa is a beautiful place
---
I've seen this power only once before
---
If you are grinding something specifik like a god roll Service Revolver you can buy lots of boon of the vanguard to maximize your amount of vanguard tokens received for each strike.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---

---
What system you playing on?
---
Sad as it doesn't go away until Thursday reset. Should have waited and did them Tuesday

---
Nah. Its referring to a kid 99% of the time. Never seen it in reference to anyone with a high pitched voice.
---
Congrats!! I remember doing my first raid and I was so extremely nervous throughout the whole thing. It was last wish and I was on tether duty most of the time :)
---
I doubt I‚Äôd do another raid though, they stress the hell out of me and I‚Äôm afraid of doing things wrong and people getting mad at me haha

The nerfs were reasonable, buffs are still needed tho
---

---

---
If they nerf nighthawk we‚Äôre gonna shoot up bungie HQ
---
Agreed. Thats when I purchased mine.
---
Yeah but the motes of dark are like pyramid shaped... and that‚Äôs like... 3 or four triangles per mote...I‚Äôm on to you drifter...
---
It‚Äôs easy mechanics wise, the main reason you will wipe is a lack of team cohesion, coordination and communication. Namely, it is extremely easy for one person to a screw a run because they can‚Äôt properly cover their role because, for the most part, unless you are someone like gladd, this raid requires everyone to be on the ball and ready to react to anything. In general though I would say this raid is actually more of a focus on skill and awareness than it is mechanics so I would suggest just making sure your team works well together and can hold themselves up.
---
I am a Titan main, and I say that the Titans who use OEM with Jotunn are a disgrace. They are taking advantage of incredibly powerful things that are just not fun. A true Titan uses their own strength, not that of a broken armor piece or weapon.
---
BuF TiTaN
---
LOOK AT MY NAME GUARDIAN
---
Personally I despise Io, between the obnoxious Taken and boring same-color landscape I really don't enjoy being there haha
---
It also has some of the least fun activities in the game IMO. Taken Blight is probably the most annoying event to me, and the Strike has one of the most annoying bosses in the game as well. The only place that's more disappointing for me to be I think is Mercury, but at least I really do enjoy Mercury's landscape! I think it has a much more pleasant palette than Io's sickly yellow-green (not to mention the past and future timelines!)
---
it's comp, fun kind of takes a backseat in this mode since you're here to win and climb, not have fun. OEM, spectral, AoS, DRB etc are the meta because people found that using them boosted their chances of winning. feel free to use whatever you want since it is a game and you are supposed to enjoy it, but unless you are way above average not using the meta like everyone else only puts you at a disadvantage
---
I really wish some early game items would get proper Legendary versions later on! Especially starter armor :(
---
We complained about this in D1 after the first DLC!
---
People cleared last wish with only bows, no guns, etc. Sotp with rat king, etc. All these bosses have mechanics that allow you to extend the wipe mechanic and have multiple damage phases. Meta weapons are good ad clear, high dps weapons so if you use non meta weapons the encounter just last longer and require somewhat more skill and patience. Plus, when you don't meet ll requirements, you LL be wanting to use the best loadout possible.

And ursa furiosa with machine gun loader.

I'm a titan use solar abilities usually hammer throws (top tree) or spinning hammer thing (middle tree).

Which would work better in iron banner. My head's spinning reading up on this, I find reddit threads that are phd theses on the subject.

You see the way my inventory is setup, the way it works is... I had my bullets, but they‚Äôre in the vault. I got an inventory and I got a vault. And I had to do a transfer but it‚Äôs gonna take 3 business days. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gonna go through
---
Because you said they could kill Thanks when they really couldn‚Äôt.
---
It‚Äôs just a silly thing to say

Not from the vanguard.

pff, don‚Äôt be like that.
---
sadly no, just a display piece. i may invest in one with moving parts though. love the look of this thing.
---
Rip
---
No I know it‚Äôs not a grind, like I said to another person, there‚Äôs a number of things I could be doing instead of getting SR. So I was asking if I should go for it.
---
The option is obviously there since previewing shaders colors all exotics, they just dont want us to have it:(
---
i have no idea why this is being downvoted but congrats on getting the guns
---
just blame activision
---
Thats a weird looking Kindled Orchid
---
Totally agree and I didn't play D1 but everyone seem to just keep asking for old exotics.

Yea honestly it‚Äôs not that hard to not die in a raid. The only encounter I‚Äôve wiped on in these past few weeks has been shiro chi, being the bitch she is. It‚Äôs really as simple as just shooting the enemies, tethering them, using wells and banner shields. Dying just shows bad coordination.

Im in the same spot its hard but doable. I was all set for hitting fabled after the reset bump but I thought ''need 3 comp games for invitation of the 9? Ah it'll be fine, maybe i'll win and won't have to worry''....I was so wrong, DO NOT PLAY AT THE WEEKEND!! Im only at 1960 now and even with the 120 bump, i'll still have to win one.

I've died in that running part of prestige Leviathan because my character did not grab the ledge. Best part is the guy who was raging at me, and everyone else, died within 10 seconds of starting. Or when calling stuff out I had to tell him I can't hear the call outs because he was talking about nothing important. Like, I appreciate taking the helm, but you also need to know when you screw up and accept responsibility for it and when not to talk.
---
You should photoshop all the nerfed d2 weapons onto the symbols. Probs need to add a few more symbols though
---
I did the job for ya and now you technically have both titles!
---
I‚Äôll try that thanks.
---
An exemplar of what it means to be a Titans. Keep punching, good sir, you are doing the Travelers work.
---
Thanks!
---
I'm sure it was fable but I have reset once and dont have it.

Torch sight, projection fuse, firmly planted, rangefinder, range masterwork.

True for sunbreakers

Did you know that EP have possible rewards rotation? You can check them on braytech.org, for example.
---
I‚Äôve been watching his unique build videos, the man is so creative.
---
This is a flex for help lol
---
lol,  Sadly I always get a match, sub 500 and 75% I will not win. If am leading in the leaderboard, there is a major issue going on.
---
I know. Some week you can get all of them or other just one. This week was only the shootgun and did it a lot of times and nothing. And the other players the same. Only shaders...
---
The weapons are on A weekly rotation and sometimes only certain weapons are available on certain weeks.
---
Wow if that's killing you then don't go into comp
---
Ha, fair enough!
---
Prism circles the 3 elemental singes so pay attention when to use your super and heavy. And heavyweight gives you more heavy bricks so you don‚Äôt have to hold onto ammo as much
---
It took me 40 tries to get all of them
---
I just need the Secret Victories emblem and then I have my Destanations: Forsaken badge completed for hunter. Other than that I need Malfeasance for Forsaken exotics and then grind out everything else.
---
Was anybody else annoyed with how inconsistently strong Thanos was in the movies?
---
Think I‚Äôll go into hibernation for a while.
---
Yup it‚Äôs normally meüòø

Some people like burgers, some people like lettuce, and others like human fecal matter. Just because it floats your boat doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs going appease the masses as it obviously hasn‚Äôt. 30 mil player drop.
---
Wow üòÆ so many hunters killed
---
I mean, there's a reason you guys are the most played class
---
Play comp. Valor gets awarded there too, and your streak doesn't get reset on a loss there, so once you've won 5 games overall, you're getting standard loss points and the 5-streak points on every win. Makes a huge difference on 2x/3x valor weeks, still takes time but not nearly as long.
---
I had the best luck doing sleeper nodes until I got a Schematic and then waiting until reset the next day to do more. Seemed like it only took about 2-3 nodes to get one and your odds are a lot better that way! Still an annoying grind though.
---
If only it were that easy! Ha. If you‚Äôre a solo player, I‚Äôd seriously recommend using LFG on the Destiny app to find a fire team to raid with. I play solo for the most part and did almost everything using LFG. It‚Äôs actually really simple to use and most people are pretty friendly!
---
Not to mention how great of a raid Last Wish is.
---
Sleeper nodes are the music boxes? If so, then I've done probably over 100 of them and nothing. :(
---
&gt; You just keep grabbing at straws that lead nowhere. -Just_a_Rose
---
Please don't be a hypocrite and liar. If you complain about people debunking your strawmans, that's all on you when you are the direct source.
---
&gt;So you‚Äôre upset because endgame content is difficult? -Just_a_Rose
---
You claimed "The nerfs won‚Äôt really change anything anyways." -Just_a_Rose
---
That's false. You got debunked by several others with countless example such as water down exotic, gambit, raids, and quests.
---
Now you move the goal post and strawman and saying "So you‚Äôre upset because endgame content is difficult?"
---
So you're upset you got debunked and want to be willfully ignorant? Because obviously everybody knows now they are nerfing some the best guns and supers. There's a difference between balancing a game and butchering it. If you farm new gear that's good, it's just going to be hit eventually by another season of nerfs.

&gt;Bungie Is Nerfing Destiny 2's Best Guns, And Players Aren't Pleased

So you original point of nerfs not really changing is already debunked. So you want to go off topic, again on you. Once that's debunked you'll just move the goal post again. You are welcome to share new concerns, just don't get upset when the facts don't follow your narrative.
---
&gt;Third, that last point is bullshit. People still play the game no matter what.-Just_a_Rose
---
But apparently inconvenient facts are "bullshit" for you. So how exactly are these people playing the game when they quit or uninstalled? 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/aodfwd/how_many_people_have_stopped_playing_fallout_76/
---
Clear show people just don't play games no matter what, you had unfounded blanket opinion without doing any research. Bad games or updates drive people out.
---
Now you insist people "don't care" because you can keep playing. 
---
If people don't care about games in general as you insisted. Be it destiny2 or fallout 76. Then why all the backlash about the one of the biggest exotic/super/meta nerfs in destiny2. Thousands of post on reddit on bungie forms sharing constructive negative feedback. If people didn't care then they wouldn't post. Saying people "don't care" when they do and research show otherwise is just dishonest an a lazy argument.  
---
Same goes with game reviews showing people review and care about a product. Another prime example. Fallout was very popular, Fallout 76 tanked the franchise. No game dev/studio is immune to bad decisions.

Yeah, only do a couple each day until you get a Legendary Schematic to turn into Ana. Those are what reward you with the weapons for the Collections badge. After you get one Schematic though, your chances of getting another are pretty low. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôd just wait until the next day to try for another one. That way it‚Äôs not so much grinding at a time too!
---
Maybe some might be confused like me, you're either 
---
1. As the previous comments stated, looking for 3 tokens/medallions you need to charge by beating 3 hidden bosses inside the shattered throne.
---
Or 2. You just beat the 3 bosses in the.??? Quest in the tangled shore and now you're onto the first one people are mentioning. Hence, you have to re-enter the shattered throne up to the part you beat the ogre (the ogre room has the final 3rd charge token)
---
A clanmate calls this 'build a guardian'.
---
Big kappa on this!
---
I'm pretty confident it gets more energy if you use it with the Ursine Guard buff up. I've been using it to keep my teammates from getting flinched in Zero Hour, and I get my super back completely every time. Likewise, generates a ton of orbs for the infini-tether strat.
---
If you're soloing, you're better off running Doomfang, honestly.
---
I‚Äôm way late to this thread, but do you not get kicked for inactivity in rumble?
---
Took out ghaul. Woke up the traveler. And now half of what i hear in the streets is how much you and your clan are making a difference. And that's why i started this whole clan thing in the first place. People are still waiting for the Vanguard to lead the way. But whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 13.
---
/r/Fireteams
---
Whoa
---
What medium are you using for this?
---
Same reason a lot of people don't raid. I don't have friends or proper clanmates to raid with and if i find people on the Destiny app, i'd just be on add clear (which is totally fine by me) because i don't know anything. Only ever completed LW once and never even attempted Leviathan and Scourge Of The Past. I don't think most people are okay with fully carrying someone.
---
Very first cause I read it was the shortest somewhere
---
Goddamn... I still can't find it in me to finish Dredgen.
---
My god, have you had the game since Launch? Or got it at forsaken
---
Cries in none complete
---
Launch, stopped at Osiris, and got back in at forsaken
---
Happens when an enemy is despawning.
---
I make no excuses, if anyone is, I am the one holding the team up at the platforming challenges. I suck.
---
&gt;even though I've been having fun. Is it even worth it?
---
The whole point of video games is to have fun. If you are having fun, it's worth it. Whether or not other people are having fun should not dictate what you do.
---
And you're further proving my point 2 of those encounters the whisper is primarily used for. So again, there's no need for a Nerf unless once again, they designed the next raid so it's a big critical area and it forces you to stand further back from it.
---
The whole point of my argument is that bungie is lazy with its encounters and then they nerf the weapons used to play "their" play style to make it more challenging instead on designing something different.
---
Old gambit match from where the third round wasn‚Äôt sudden death, just never posted it
---
Personally, I like this season's better, but I suppose it is a matter of opinion.
---
http://imgur.com/a/3uFr6Kt
---
yeah i understand that, but I don't want to waste my time gathering exotics and progressing characters for a game that isn't really paying attention to their fanbase, it kinda pisses me off. This is a no brainer i guess, if you're having fun then who cares, but I don't know in the end.
---
This is amazing!
---
Also, what song is that?
---
That one
---
That is a reasonable concern. However, the nerfs don't go into effect until June 4th, there are legitimate arguments for why most of them are necessary, and it's unclear how severe exactly the nerfs to exotic armor will be. It could end up being really mild, similar to the One Eyed Mask nerf a few months ago, or it could be really severe, similar to the Wormhusk Crown nerf a few months before that. There's no way to know just yet.
---
This is why I have a big problem with people complaining about nerfs. Just because they are changing stuff does not mean the game is getting worse. They are changing up the game so people change their damn loadouts. I'm willing to bet money people out there never switch off ace and have no idea what other guns are out there. Recently I got to a point where I font even have an exotic on. Keep playing and try some other stuff lots of good guns around.
---
You can't buy it outright if you haven't beaten Leviathan for that week.

---
Yup, it's said that they nerfed the trench barrel to 3 or 4 shots ( cants remember). So now you gotta keep on punching every once in a while and you loose a little time on total DPS.
---
If the beautiful 999999 damage disappear, i'll go mad
---
Yerp, made a joke about that in the comments, but seems like people don't get the joke :/

Yes

That really is america's ass tho

It goes double for no people with stereos and double no for ice cream.

So easy to counter lol and I have it so you can‚Äôt say I don‚Äôt know shit

I don't think I check them often enough. It says "It's both" which is probably right.

That stupidity from my mind aside. Congrats! You have way too much time and I wish I had half of it.
---
The idea of Thanos' galaxy conquering henchmen being given pause by Black Widow/Hawkeye also irks me 
---
Thanos babying Hulk into submission, but being stalled by Cap was also a wtf for me
