Complete the seal then I think you have a limited time to purchase the seal from Bungie.net can‚Äôt exactly remember I was broke when I got my rivensbane so didn‚Äôt get it
---
---
---
Already did it anyway
---
Are you doing them in the Hollows ?
---
Nice
---
So I just did the 25 melee portion of it, now it really doesnt say what to do? Guides say earn EXP, Generate Orbs and Complete a challenge, but it isnt tracking it at all?  Did i miss something?
---
This

Testing
---
I had no idea it was a real remix! I just figured Bungie's in-house composer made it specially for the trailer. I used to listen to the original all the time so hearing it in the trailer was an awesome blast from the past :)
---
All you did was make assumptions(this is reddit after all). I never once said I couldn't beat them when in fact I can(multiple seasons of legend). I was just making a post trying to get Destiny comp(at least) to require skill and be talked about from numerous outlets about being a good comp game &amp; it should deserve spotlight like CSGO or CoD.

Jokes on you, that‚Äôs the ghost that revived Uldren, and we are ripping it to shreds

Ever since vanilla powerful gear has been the only way to increase power levels. Oh well. Guess I will see if I am wrong on launch day

yes. it is

Dude this is what guns are like now so what are guns gonna be like in the golden age

Wholesome af. Asking wife about finances first and the interaction that follows is inspiring!
---
No I'm not I didn't know that was necessary, thank you
---
You been doing a lot better ever since you got that new internet?
---
I keep trying to double jump and soft land in BL3. It bums me out.
---
Idk fam but lets hope we stick long enough to find out
---
I actually really enjoy Anthem‚Äôs whole atmosphere more than Destiny‚Äôs. However, Destiny‚Äôs story and characters are much better
---
lol +1 on this

Nope only guardians will survive this one dude

And what the hell are we huh ?
---
The khvostov could switch between all firing modes

I have the entire first week of October off (clan is going for at least a Top 10 completion for new raid), but I have Jury Duty in the second. Missing out on a whole day of grinding.
---
Well right now we are mostly humans minus a few hitlers in the group
---
Haha I just understood where you were coming from. Besides, the only response unless your partner is a gamer too would likely be in the area of "... üòë Tf?" LOL. Got no kids but got a future wife to be. I'm only 27 but I been thru all kinds of bad, decent, wierd relationships. Rn engaged to a future PhD psych relationship researcher and is 3 yrs younger than me so we'll see how that goes lol. Good luck to you and your family in the future!! Oh and ur destiny grind too üëç
---
The fact that I still came back after such a break should be enough to show that I care about the game.
---
The break was because after getting Anarchy and not getting OneKVoices I just felt tired about grinding the same pve stuff over and over, it felt like chasing a dream that would never come true.
---
Now I can see the fun part about pvp but still, amazing how a game with a good story, good graphics and ambientations, and a nice mobility and gunplay can still be ruined by a bad design team.

Congrats for making this actually fucking huge triumph for me seem meaningless. I'm only like a 1.18 in quick and 1.08 in comp so I was hella happy to get this. What a great community we have
---
That's been all borderlands games on release though, once events and DLC start happening though you get a lot more variety. Hell, a lot of people played borderlands 2 basically every day for the last 7 years because there's so many different builds and ways to play through the game differently once some of that DLC diversity comes around.
---
I always thought "i refuse to bury any more friends" is his way of saying "dont die dumbdumb, kick his ass"
---
You know how his personailty is. Zavala is not the OwO kind of guy. Especially the scene where he goaded ikora to call him a coward,it seems very deliberate. 
---
He cant officially declare war on just uldren and not drag the whole reef awoken into it but he can do the next best thing and deploy the godkiller.
---
I mean I literally posted it saying it was gonna get downvoted, because I know this community. 
---
r/whoosh

I know. I‚Äôve played them. I know there‚Äôs lots of customization. But what‚Äôs the point of doing it?

There‚Äôs no raids or end game activity

Thanks! Take it easy!

really nice help, after years i still can find sweet spot.

---
Are you high?
---
Check titan for a special version of it
---
Yep, did it just for the invitation quest, queued up and matched with 4 other guys from 690-695, and one at 750.
---
After half an hour we got to the last boss, at which 1 full mag of Thunderlord (ok, not the best boss dps weapon, but not the worst) at 693 overall light level hit for maybe 3-4% of the boss' health.
---
After 5 minutes of fight in which all of us except 750 guy kept getting 1 shot by knights, we didn't even get the boss down to 2/3 hp.
---
Tactics were correct and we kept destroying the shield with orbs, popping supers and going ham at it with heavies.
---
Quit the fight as I was spending more time in ress screen than playing.
---
Just for the record, I almost completed Petra's run several times at 5/6, guitar bugs or silly deaths carrying Riven's heart the only things between me and the triumph, just as to state I'm not that bad of a player.
---
I won't be queuing for the Menagerie again anytime soon.
---
Thank you so much
---
Arent they?
---
If not, then surely a bromance type relationship.
---
Haha yeah ü§£
---
Rest easy, Guardian, your Light won't ever fade
---
Its amazing how our Fathers leave such an effect on us, my dad (I regard as real though we arent biologically related, idc about that) he introduced me to Fallout but passed away 2 years ago due to a long and hard battle with MS but even to this day, I still play Fallout and planning on doing something to commemorate him 
---
No matter what happens, just know your dad is proud and happy to have a bond with you like that, similar to mine I'd say

---
Eyes up, Guardian because we aren't done here yet when our time comes to pass on, they will be waiting on the other side for us for now let's celebrate their lives and push on in their memory etched forever in our hearts and minds because then they aren't truly gone
---
Titan should have it as an option next to the original strike or as an option when you elect the individual strike.
---
Highly recommended you do it with a full group though.
---
Good luck :)
---
You‚Äôre probably right
---
Don‚Äôt need to tell me twice
---
I recently heard "Happy spouse, happy house," which I think works better on several levels. üôÇ

I got back in after a long while and have been playing. I feel like I'm stuck at 30 with a soft stuck 347 light? I may however be misunderstanding what you mean
---
What are yours? Prove u arent just using reddit to write the article for you lol
---
Honestly I wish we fought our way out of the last City. I was looking forward to some sort of desperate break out/break away. Not this easy trek through the mountains with no intensity to it whatsoever..
---
that's because these changes will go live when shadowkeep releases, which is next week
---
Not trying to contradict you at all as I used to think Fighting Lion was junk.
---
I forced myself to learn it while working on the catalyst, now I never unequip it if I don't have to.

I assume thats a prototype Vow as well

Thank you! That's exactly what I wanted!

Excerpt of the Ecstasy. The song that plays when the Speaker chats to you after recovering a shard of the Traveler from a Hive ogre in the Hellmouth. The one you hear waiting for a Crucible match in a low-count game mode, watching the stars in the background shimmer and fade. The melody you soak in when you stay in orbit for a bit too long after a late night raid, dozing off as your ship stays calmly still soaring over the planet you were just on.
---
Honestly that's a good question! I was wondering the same thing
---
Damn, i thought the casuals were bad. this is even worse;  
---
all this post proved is you're a hypocrite. XD
---
I remember life before Jotunn/ Truth. Times were simpler lol. 
---
Again, I couldn‚Äôt agree with you more my friend.
---
Because spending money you fon't even have yet is a terrible idea. I don't ubderstand tge US's fascination with credit cards
---
No. You can pay for someone to go on your account and get you an item, but this is highly frowned upon in the destiny community.
---
Am I the only one that saw the title and my entire brain goes "IRISH NOISES! TOP OF MORNING!"
---
It's serious to me too, Mr. Gary...
---
The queen Mara would agree with you
---
He's just continuing the pizza time scene from Spiderman 2.

This is fantastic! Never quit.

I suppose I can kinda see what you mean. I don‚Äôt think I ever looked too deep into it and just assumed that‚Äôs just how he is not that he‚Äôs ungrateful. 
---
I did watch a video he dropped a few weeks back talking about his plans the coming months. He mentions picking up borderlands 3 but then said that as soon as Shadowkeep drops he will be dropping borderlands and be fully committed to getting destiny videos out. He very clearly states that he is committed to the destiny franchise/community and to me it came off that he is grateful and loyal to what made him a successful YouTuber.  
---
Idk though it‚Äôs not a big deal if you guys don‚Äôt like him, just throwing out my opinion .
---
They function like fusion rifles, by using batteries
---

---
If you‚Äôre going to correct someone, you shouldn‚Äôt be wrong yourself lol
---
Don‚Äôt. Just don‚Äôt remind me...
---
Thanks for the advice
---
I pretty much agree with everyone else. I'd like to suggest MP edits, as his edits ideas have very clean edits and he gets good players for his videos (bakengangsta and CammyCakes for example) while also placing memes that aren't tiring. TBH his thorn and last word ones are the best but I love all of his vids
---
Im gonna name mine ace (its the symphonic one by the way
---
Some of my best memories are with my fireteam joking around and having a good time learning together. When we actually beat the raid it's a great feeling and knowing you all did it together makes it 10x better.
---
Because that's the way they programed them to be annoying
---
I would like that amazing picture please
---
It's basically so you can't just endless stack them
---
Looks great! Makes me want to get back into Destiny
---
Don't....don't do that........don't give me hope.....he can't come back, can he?
---
And plus there are two strikes for titan
---
It will recognize foresaken on account 1 if y out but sk on account 2
---
Good old times üòç
---
Ah i remember dogs very clearly, first time we raided, we needed like 3 hours for that shit, second time we did it at the  2nd try, i think. lol
---
Mostly everything is solo except raids. But the downfall is that everything is 20 times harder solo. If your having a hard time or feel like your missing out on some content because it‚Äôs not solo able just use the destiny companion app on your phone because it has a really good group finder and is really reliable and fast.
---
Hmm.
---
Yep, got mine as a strike reward lol
---
PRECIOUS.
---
so its just a random drop now?
---
It‚Äôs a random world drop but your best bet is to buy the fated engram from xur and have a better chance
---
The quest you need is called  The Chasm of Screams on Titan. It's a special version of Savathun's song strike.
---
Yeah
---
No idea haven't really played since just before black armoury. They didn't patch it out back then and I did it for ages so should work. It's a tough journey for sure each class has its own difficult bits to get across
---
Ah, ok. Gotcha. Thanks man.
---
I think we did it together, I remember do speedruns with you

You can be carried through it if you don't have Forsaken and can't get to an adequate Power Level, however next Tuesday (Oct 1st) all of your gear is going to be boosted to 750 which might change your ability to actually do the mission without being carried.

I‚Äôd recommend resilience for titan, recovery for warlock and mobility for hunter. That‚Äôs what I use and what I generally see people use on their classes. I don‚Äôt know the specifics but those attributes seem to work well with the play style and abilities of specific classes.
---
My first time doing the mission I almost shit a brick when the first dogs started approaching me
---
Because they're sort of redundant/tied to an irrelevant activity atm. Levi is the only Raid with a token system and a related benefactor; a remnant of the old NPC days where everything worked by token.
---
They probably didn't bother updating it because at the moment Leviathan isn't really relevant - it will be in Armor 2.0, but not at the moment.
---
Basically, old activities don't get much love/care and the token system is an artefact of a dark age and they really don't expect people to be stacking anywhere near 9999 of those things. That being said I too have over 2,000.
---
Lies
---
Because he doesn't know if his Ghost even can still revive him. His Ghost doesn't speak anymore apparently, and otherwise doesn't act much like a Ghost would anymore either (it floats differently and has a red eye that doesn't blink).
---
It's a possibility that he could just kill himself and be rezzed and be fine again, which would mean he suffered for nothing. But there's good reasons to doubt this outcome too.

It'd be a gamble, and arguably not worth the risk.

Until your cornering shoulder charge is ended by a shotgun blast... seriously can‚Äôt ‚Äúhunt‚Äù anyone down, you have to be a stealthy titan and flank em.
---
Winner!
---
Beacuse my friend you will get bumped to 750 light level with blue gear. Yours stuff won't get upgraded by itself. If somebody have collected gearbwith godrolls only then that person will spend a lot materials. Also it will keep you going during dropping powerfull gear that you don't like for longer so you will not have need to stop playing shadowkeep story.
---
Zavala going for the assault on the moon is 100% the right move to prevent the hive from turning it jnto a warmoon and just wiping thr last city off the map. Going on a revenge rampage in territory that belonged to other parties the city didnt want to piss off was also 100% the right choice too. Its also not like he dissallowed us to avenge cayde, he just didnt want to make it an official assault and wanted to keep the vanguard out of the potential conflict. 
---
Vuvuzela gets a bad rep. just bc hes a killjoy doesnt mean that he doesnt make the responsible and right choices
---
I personally try and get as much recov as I can on both hunter and titan, Rocking like 6 4 9 on my hunter and 1 7 9 on my titan.
---
Hunter by far, then Titan and Warlock.  This is my experience on PC however. Console may be different.  Easirst way I can tell is the Crucible Kills tracker emblem shows kills per class and Hunter us usually as much as Titan and Warlock combined.

*titan smells the lingering smoke from a smoke bomb

You could maybe squeeze a few FPS by tightening your RAM timings but I wouldn't expect a miracle.

they are bringing back the gjallarhorn as a weapon of sorrow called the "deathbringer" what are your thoughts on it since its a weapon of sorrow now(only weapons of sorrow look like they want to eat your ass out through your lungs here is a picture [https://i.imgur.com/nN8idU6.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/nN8idU6.jpg) see what I mean)
---
I love it!

Yeah all my gf does is yell at me to stop playing video games lol
---
That's a hard pass dawg.
---
Was it significantly higher? I have a Ryzen 5 1600 / rx 580 with most setting set to High and run about 75 fps with rare drops to 58 fps.
---
Keep them. They are precious.
---
Skullfort here, shoulder charging feels too good
---
Ew
---
No. i am you.
---
Accoring to the test, i should get some average 59-60 fps, right? I am not getting even stable 40, most of the time it is 35 with sluttering and freezes. I should mention, that same low settings and gt 1030 performs much better
---
Dodge.
---
What?
---
Most beautiful in very classical terms.
---
I hope bungie does something againt leavers because it sucks.
---
Yea but if changing gfx settings has no effect its usually something else other than your GPU. You could upgrade to something like the Ryzen 5 2600X , same socket size and more than double the performance for like $160
---
Nothing is changing damage-wise for 450 pulse rifles in PvP. 450 pulse rifles will have the exact same numbers as before, but now with more damage dropoff. So, contrary to what OP seems to think, Outbreak Perfected is actually getting nerfed in PvP, although the significance of the nerf remains to be seen.
---
OP seems to have gotten confused by the fact that 340 Pulses (high impact) and 540 Pulses (rapid fires) are getting a damage buff in PvP. But Outbreak Perfected is not in either of those archetypes, so it won‚Äôt be getting any buff.
---
bungies fate is to be decided in the coming weeks. People seem to forget that it wasn't just activision pressuring bungie on every single shitty design choice since they acquired them. To an extent they certainly did but you have to admit bungie have fucked up a lot. Hopefully they turn this around for shadowkeep.

---
Ah. I knew two of the archetypes where getting buffed but had no clue which archetype outbreak is. Thank you
---
It‚Äôs not even the case that Outbreak Prime is getting any boost to consistency in PvP. The only PvP change that applies to Outbreak is the damage falloff, which is a nerf. So basically Outbreak will just be slightly to moderately worse in PvP depending on how severe the nerf is.
---
No.

What, you got plans on Tuesday?

Well, yeah...
---
I want trailer guy to narrate our journey
---
Just wait till October 1st and you'll be 750 power along with everyone else, I suggest buying shadowkeep for the new story and wxktivited that also come with the season pass which is included with shadowkeep
---
ZA WARUDO! Then I hop in the portal before the blueberry can move
---
thats the point. at least trying to shed light to whoever does have a say. hunters are a great class but whenever you encounter a titan you might as well unplug your router. OEM and seeing that fucker with a locked on stair to my ass i know im getting shoulder charged and for ghe unfortunate player around me, he‚Äôs gonna have the worst time trying to fight Thanos.
---
I am a console player, you are insane.
---
Everybody gets bumped up to 750???
---
Just gonna pull out the quick one two punch - a skilled hunter
---
managing some peoples finances takes longer than others. It absolutely matters for us. Being small business owners sucks. But i'm sure you know more about my life than I do. Have a nice day, dick.
---
Yes because in order for new players to be on an even playing field 750 which is the max right now will become the new 0, nothing in the game will drop below 750 on October 1st
---
Why does this happen (im new)
---
They got borderlands 3 about a day earlier than everyone else, so balance has been brought to the universe
---
Jokes on you, I can text my right hand as well!
---
Oh boy, can‚Äôt wait to claim my shitty 750 power rare gear
---
The sunken cost fallacy explains all of those things. People waste so muxh time on destiny that they identify with it and must validate their poor choices by playing it constantly
---
750 is 750 though,
---
True
---
Nah, you get a few exotic quests and some Legendary weapons that are really good but they are not mandatory. The exotic quest from Warmind is unlocked when you finish that campaing so you might have it anyway in your boosted character.
---
I heard servers are down Monday so do it before then. My weekend may be busy so I'm doing it this week.
---
Actually all of the current gear you have will be bumped up to 750.
---
YEEEESSSSSSS
---
Noice! i am still waiting on mine :(
---
[deleted]
---
True but they said they would speed up reload significantly to counter balance it. I‚Äôm sure it won‚Äôt lose much dps at all
---
So basically you want like 3-4 exotics just mixed into the kit for free? Keep dreaming buddy.
---
What money was stolen from vanilla buyers? I played D2 at launch and getting all 3 characters to 305 was a blast
---
Sunday evening I‚Äôm literally deleting everything I haven‚Äôt used in six months. Two weeks into shadowkeep, I‚Äôll regret the new metas, probably.
---
Players back out at the very last second as the match starts. It takes them out correctly on their end, but the matchmaking system doesn‚Äôt have time to register and starts the match anyways.
---
Eh. If I can be honest, I've posted this a handful of places and it just flopped. I actually have been beating myself up over it for a while when he said I should post it here cause it's Destiny related. I haven't browsed this subreddit much at all so I didn't know how it'd go over and honestly expected it to flop again. I realize how the title sounds now and I honestly kinda regret it. But. People regret saying a lot of things when they were upset and I was upset when I posted this, heh.
---
From here on out tho I'm definitely just gonna post my art! Whether it goes over well or not, I know now that at least some people will enjoy it as much as I do!
---
Yeah you only need a fire team for the end game content really and can still grind weekly and daily power drops solo. Nightfall strike and raid is the only you really need communication for.
---
Thanks, man. I think I'm gonna try to post a question on the bungie forum and hope to get a straight answer from someone there. This is so confusing. I'll respond to your comment if I hear anything. Cheers.
---
GAH! those who hear the cursed screams seldom live to tell the tale!
---
Sorry bout that its my first post i didnt know hehe...
---
I like margarita to be honest. Plain and simple
---
Cool, thanks
---
Too old for club penguin I‚Äôm afraid.
---
This titan
---
When shadowkeep comes out everything is gonna be bumped up to 750 cuz it will be the new baseline. And armor 2.0 will come out as well so I would save any big armor grinding for october
---
Was the box marked 'Fragile'?
---
Yes /s
---
Exactly what I was thinking
---
Nope. I think they went again.
---
Heads up, guardian! :D
---
&gt;too much classic wow!
---
Luckily I'm not very into wow.. But black desert and borderlands are doing their own on my end!! XD
---
Edit: and I said luckily because I know it is a very absorbing game! (Well.. Every game you love is absorbent but y'know what I mean.. )
---
What are you going for, Recluse?
---
What about escalation protocol? Is that included?
---
Yea it would be so easy too since I made a ghost birthday cake for his 21st. We even kept the "eye" I made out of led lights

Thanks for explanation.
---
Its awesome! It sucks when you're proud of something and they couldnt be asked to acknowedge it.
---
Wait are the raids free?
---
Oh man, did they finally push through the shadowkeep pre update today (I'm at work)? Looks like no playing for me tonight. Last time they did this just before forsaken and it was 4 hours of downloading for me
---
Greetings guardians  As title, i have destiny 2 installed on my ps4 
---
I pre ordered Shadowkeep and it seems like i need to download 74GB again

 Is there anyway to activate shadowkeep on my previous base game?
---
Yea I have a hard time believing that too but you might be right. If i had the shader i'd test it.

^(I'm sorry)
---
And here‚Äôs a blade barrage. 
---
Welcome to the fucking Shards Of Galanor mayhem show. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
But then they get 7 kills thanks to nova bomb
---
Only ones i haven‚Äôt fully completed are Last Wish and Spire
---
# Spooky scary skeletons
---
In Canada we are on and apparently for Shadowkeep the game will be off for 24h ( September 30th to October 1st ).
---
Lucky
---
No
---
üò≠ it wouldn‚Äôt come back in stock for almost 2 months. I waited but no update or reply, just to have them say they‚Äôre giving away the last 7 on a stream
---
Same deal here I believe. Servers are being wonky at the moment though.
---
Wish I coulda been there
---
The dropoff on C batteries is way better.  AAA does not have the god awful bloom either. Now the 9V legend of Acrius is really where it's at.
---
Then delete it.
---
Ah ok. Could be maintenance then but I can‚Äôt find any notes anywhere
---
Spire is very mechanical. I'd put that on hard.
---
What are you talking about? They just announced D3 and are dropping all support for D2.
---
It's your subreddit flair. Easy way to do it is open this subreddit in your browser and there will be an option to set your flair there.
---
Yep same here

It‚Äôs a lot easier to just do the shuro chi wish and backtrack to that same chest, or if your on warlock just warlock skate to backtrack from morgeth for a second free chest
---
The 24 hour maintenance is on September 30th though.
---
I waited too, I am fucking pissed, I dearly wanted it. I feel betrayed as a Destiny collector. But life was like fuck you to me and I just couldn't fucking afford it before it went out. I'm so heartbroken about it!
---
That's interesting.  Hmm...
---
Thank you my good sir I really appreciate the help
---
Lag
---
I don't have Forsaken and the download was 70 gigs also.
---
O
---
It is cool bro. Sometimes we need to get a little bit scared, just so we get our hearts racing a little bit.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Good meme though.
---
Same issue for me. Really aggravating.
---
I can‚Äôt log on either. I‚Äôm on Xbox
---
Yeah, I'm having this issue on PC (Battle.net).
---
Whats more scary is that they aren't responding to the threads on bungie.net or on twitter
---
I‚Äôm having this issue too.
---
Same here.
---
This close to SC and  so many people can‚Äôt even log on.
---
Got a 30 day from psn on the 20th of September. Guess who's quitting destiny lmao
---
Think the servers went down or something so there doing maintenance otherwise no clue
---
Yup, got this as well.
---
That is funky now I have to download a super huge file and I don't have enough room to have both 88gb files and another 77gb for shadowkeep...
---
Who is to say we don't have those kinds of issues that you speak of anyway.
---
I guarantee this is "not" what a large portion of the current D2 players thought when they mentioned oh we just need to sign up for migrating to steam and that's all we had to do NOT!
---
I do very much appreciate your help and it did clarify what to do and I thank you for that.....very nice !
---
part of me needs this to be an intentional attack on titan abridged reference
---
As much as I fully believe Anthem will never be relevant other than shitpost material, I said the same thing about No Man's Sky and that game pulled the most unexpected 180 ever.
---
Is it not possible to purchase this anymore? Every time I checked, it said it was unavailable, yet everyone is getting one...
---
My Destiny Companion app wont even pull my info. Says it cant connect...
---
r/unexpectedmontypython
---
Your giving me PTSD
---
Hey, if you don't want those free wins, I'll take 'em.
---
*cries in 500 glory*
---
Cool
---
That's funny I too nickname my weapons like my Fighting lion, a.k.a  "THOT DESTROYER 5000"
---
Bring that one eyed right this way my hunter ass has a little something for ya.
---
Imagine making a game people are happy is coming out and proud you managed to actually managed to fix something just to fuck it all up and make people cancel their preorders
---
Are you forgetting that changing Eververse so the current season's item were completely inaccessible except through silver/bright dust was a post-Activision, 100% Bungie decision? Or removing seasonal content at the end of each season even though it's content they're making you pay for?
---
There's still plenty of shit to talk.
---
What if when you die it turns out you can do anything you want in your afterlife and you can actually be a guardian for real?
---
Destiny's PvP is built for shitty players.
---
You are gonna want all 3.  They all have their uses.  Grinding light is much quicker with 3 characters.  Do them all.  Decide for your self which you want to main.
---
"Fetchez la vache!"
---
Datto said when shadow keep comes out they will be able to purchase them with shard instead of dust from collection
---
Can you give me a hint as to how to solve mine. I'm useless at this sort of stuff.
---
The best clues r on the map on the back of the letter from Eris Morn
---
No you set your region to America‚Äôs so you‚Äôre at October 1st a day early aswell as getting it in October first.
---
Ram should be ok 16gbs of pretty nice ram. My CPU doesn‚Äôt exactly match my gpu but I thought with lowered settings and other games working fine it wouldn‚Äôt be bottlenecking it. I‚Äôm not sure.
---
it looks amazing
---
True, and i love and support nms currently (VR is amazing), but this is EA we are talking about. Big companies are not gonna stay with a game if its not making them money
---
Lol ok good luck with that bud. Seems like you just shit post bottom tier striker being one of the most mobile dualists in the game. Cool
---
Yeah I used a program like that forget what it‚Äôs called. However other games work fine, better even.
---
i would pay someone to find the people who use joten and skin them alive 
---
no homo though
---
Not really, the perfect guard perk is incredibly inconsistent and anything other than black talon is basically wasting an exotic slot.
---
That is correct.
---
My ram should be  fine. 16 gbs of pretty nice ram. My CPU is not exactly as good as my GPU but I thought with lower setting and other games working fine it wouldn‚Äôt be bottlenecked.
---
( "should i come back to d2 copy and paste. ")
---
Yes. Destiny 2 is amazing and in the best state a destiny game hss been in. I dare say its better than D1 at this point. There are more milestones/powerful gear than many players can do in a week ( multiplied by 3.) , 5 raids, gambit prime, tons of pinacle weapons from past seasons, tons of exotic quests from past seasons and all around an amazing time. 
---
Forsaken fixed the year 1 content drought by dumping a ton of content, and each season since did nothing but help. Shadowkeep is preparing to drop, and woth it another HUGE dunp of content, the return of eris morn, 5+ new strikes, new maps ( gambit &amp; crucible. ), EVEN MORE pinacle weapons and exotics, as well as more story and such taking place after the death of ( Redacted. ).
---
D2¬† couldn't be in much of a better place ( besides needing some minor crucible tweaks. )
---
Also, if you quit because of ( Mida multitool, Lunas/Not forgotten, Prometheus lense, etc.) Being VICIOUSLY busted/OP,GOOD NEWS EVERYONE, they've beem generously nerfed down to reasonable instead of busted. 
---
So all in all, coming from a D1 alpha/Beta player who has stuck to this franchise like cancer to radiation, i dont think the franchise has ever been better.¬† The only minor complaint is, whilst d2s raids are great, they are a bit more soft, unlike the brutal dark raids of D1 ( Kings Fall. ). But, don't worry, we are still slaughtering oryx's family, because all of them have a bad case of not knowing their place.¬† ( ehem. Under my boot. ) 
---
As a traitor would say...
---
Come back to destiny, yesss? Or, you diee.....
---
( rating 9.5/10. )
---
As a new player, is necessary to buy forsaken at all or I could start doing fine just with the new light content?
---
Your sparrow blew up at the end didn't it?
---
It certainly did.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought but cpu also matters I‚Äôd recommend upgrading the ram but you don‚Äôt have to
---
.
---
Well I was on the right track with that then.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been looking hoping to upgrade soon. Thanks
---
You right
---
Make sure your motherboard can handle it
---
It's No Distractions, Moving Target, with Target Acquisition mod, and I play with Controller, so Aim Assist too.
---
I once stopped a hunter blade barrage in mid animation with a shotgun punch combo. Feels like bitch slapping a crazy wife before she tossed the whole kitchen at you.
---
Go outside. Take a real gun and shoot it.
---
I'm not trying to fuel any fires or anything, but you're absolutely 100% right.
---
You summed it up perfectly in one sentence.
---
Nah nah nah, it needs to be the lumina gun shot sound and I can‚Äôt have ambient sounds like wind, enemies, humming, hissing, etc
---
*cries in digital deluxe download*
---
How? This is a story I need to hear.
---
I will use the last of my Hamon to defeat you with my Flaming Cutlery Attack!! üòÇ
---
eBay but you can find it on amazon
---
Will Shadowkeep Deluxe Edition get me Forsaken?? Or do I have to buy them separately?
---
Situation is more complicated than a meme can convey I just cherry-picked events for humorous effect. Honestly it‚Äôs probably more positive to go out and do things on my birthday than sit at home like a drug addict for two days
---
F
---
Damn, This scared the shit out of me that I have to check steam
---
Oh no
---
When the blueberry refuses to use thier super: you have genuinely angered me!
---
If i wanted to buy the game in full, with all the dlcs and anual pass, what should i buy? Im buying for PC.
---
The problem with that is I need to wait 90 days. A ludicrous amount of time to fix a simple mistake. A quarter of a year wait is a harsh punishment. 
---
I have screwed myself over here by accident.
---
If you have a lot of enchantment cores, buy simulation seeds and go to mercury for packages.  You will get around 75 percent of your shards back. Delete all year one armor from vault,  delete all shaders. It should give you a good jump for shards.
---
Are you on pc or console? Console its an amazing weapon but i hear anyone from pc say its trash
---
If you have a request you can send it to [this channel](https://discord.gg/HjpUuV) and I'll see what I can do. No charge or anything I really enjoy this.
---
Don‚Äôt mean to prod too much, but which masterwork did you go for?
---
As for me, I stick with a range MW, followed by Full Bore, Accurized, Snapshot, and Moving Target. Slapped on Target acquisition just to be a jerk.
---
I also got a hunter to kill himself by meelee him and having the my body explode in his face. Wondering though when he jumps to blade barrage if ur fast enough can u slide under his throw and survive then bitch slap after he falls. Crazy bitch just threw some flaming cutlery at me what else am i supposed to do.lol
---
All game releases are a day early for us aussies, bungie does a server update so destiny is the only game we get a day early
---
Nice now try 1000 Voices 8)
---
Nope been looking constantly
