You had fun grinding day in day out just for that legendary to turn to a rare? You had fun grind strikes and shit for the chance to get the materials to unlock the perks on your gun or armor? You had fun knowing doing the raid was your only way to actually progress and with people being highly picky on who gets into the team? Gameplay itself was fun but dont lie that at the very core of early d1 it was just shit. It wasnt till taken king that things started going good and only when the old raids were revamped that it was truly this magnificent game that alot of people played.

Same way you got stronger in the base game so powerful stuff what are these questions

Been playing since day one. Destiny has been nothing but amazing. Met amazing people and the most amazing friends because of this game. When D2 came out, damn was I disappointed. All my friends stopped playing and it was the end if it. Recently I grabbed forsaken and my god.... it is awesome! Feels slightly like D1 but has it's own personality. LOVE IT. Cant wait for the new DLC
---
Would have*
---
That giant hive fortress looks pretty good tho
---
Yup.
---

---
I'm preorder Shadowkeep. I don't care if it shit. I'm still going to play it.
---
Used LfG. Found a group after like 2 hours of rage-filled parties. Finally at 8am me and 5 others just worked real hard and used genuine understanding and compromise to overcome our egos and beat it after 3 hours. Was quite fucking impressive tbh. And oh yeh... it dropped the exotic AND a raid shotty with small ore, assault mag, pulse monitor, surrounded and range MW. Thanks for a fucking awesome experience bungie!
---
Extremely true, Activision never pushed for microtransactions to be so prevalent. Now, Destiny is going free to play. Sounds like they want some of the massive troves whales feed to F2P games.
---
I doubt it as toland became more selfish the more he learned about the hive. If anything i think he bri gs them back to level them up through sword logic to then consume to fight or dethrone savanthun. But then again this is all based on the chance toland is actually involved and those shadows could be the darkness race since they look really similar to the concept art of the darkness.  https://m.imgur.com/gallery/85Ybp
---
I think the PC has more potential, but it's just not viable for everyone to spend $1000 on a PC.  I played on ps4 for a long time and definitely had a lot of good times :)
---
Your*
---
Fuck auto correct and my Polish brain
---
It was magical. Exotics were and felt exotic, even Legendaries felt earned. Xur was a hypebeast.
---
True, but I feel like with Eris back Toland may have a heavy involvement here, although we can't really say for certain
---
Shadowkeep is revamped old content. If they include all the original tunnels and whatnot underneath the moon and expand that x2, then sure I'll see it as new. Still recycled content though, I still have D1 downloaded and can just go play that game.
---
 
---
Hilariously enough I can be at the Hellmouth with Monte Carlo and Peregrines in both games. Sounds pretty recycled to me.
---
As do I, however literally every person I know who played Origins says Odyssey is a waste of money, I never actually played Origins but from what I’ve been told the games are nearly identical
---
Lol whys that?
---
Like i said gameply was the only good thing during that time everything else felt like a chore to do. And legendaries only felt earned because you were either guranteed them in the raid or you grinded 30 emgrams with only a third being legendary.
---
I feel eris herself is hiding some pretty serious stuff just like mara.
---
If you point this out people will hate you. It's best to let them think Bungie is making it better for them.
---
I do miss my Facets though, and I especially miss the seasonal engram.
---
Activision already has been losing profit these past couple years and their stocks are seriously declining. They simply aren’t listening to the consumers, they’re choosing quick, low effort cash injections rather than planning for long term profit, they’d rather make a million dollars today than five million over the next year
---
I agree with you bro destiny at it’s core was pretty ass at that point but i’m just saying that because I always had my group of six to go through it all with it was good times for me, personally :)
---
Oh yeah it looks awesome. Initially would have guessed that the raid would take place in there but that's a whole other thing plus we go to the black garden again so it's a win win to me. I hope the tower is like a "fight your way to the top" sort of thing
---
Get gud with another weapon
---
Done with all my final blows, but only 52% on medals :,)
---
Prime is so much quicker for me imo I usually run it with my clan and have the actual roles in place
---
Ok, that is good! There were maybe 20 or so questions in this subreddit earlier from people who owned the annual pass but had somehow never finished Forsaken before, so I thought it was worth mentioning just in case.
---
*kilck klack*
---
Yup, I made a post about this and people just don't want to hear it. A year ago people hated the Eververse and it gave you everything if you played an average amount. Now people love it and you literally can't earn anything without paying 100k+ bright dust. Someone literally did all the math, and I can paste it here, but it's literally impossible to aquire the bright dust required to purchase even half of the new stock.
---
Just sounds like time to bail on the game. Black Desert Online, Elder Scrolls Online, these are games I don't play because they have an ingame market with such a presence. You can't earn any of that currency in game, so you just see all this new flashy U.I designed to make you want these items. Yet they cost more real money, oof.
---
Is there a source on this? It's too good
---
Awww hush!!!
---
That's because it is
---
Yeah I tried it a few times. Only really feels like it's better if the perks active and your hammerhead doesn't have rampage.
---
What. About. Crossplay.
---
Sorry
---
What platform? Join a clan. We have an opening on xbox1
---
Thats some clean font, whats the name of it?
---
Im hapoy to help you! Actually im about 670 on hunter, 310 on titan and 10 on warlock but hey im helpful!
---
The mission to start the new season will get you to 690. As for exotic quests there are a lot now, wish ender, thorn, last word, outbreak perfected, izanami sniper, ace of spades. Probably quite a few more im missing.
---
Yeah I'd figure since they've been out for almost a year they'd all be expired by now.
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---

---
/r/Fireteams
---
Wait shadow keep isn’t included in the Y2 season pass? Suck a fat dick Bungie!
---
Not yet. There's news about it in the future tho
---
I think this would be a pretty cool idea, as long as they find a way to make it different from each other. Mostly every foundry I can think of can make each weapon, so as long as say I don’t have to do the same quest for a Suros sniper as I am for a Hakke sniper. I like it, definitely would be a big addition to the game given all of the foundries there are, and would be a fun way to interact with the Last City aside from just stopping into the tower once a day.
---
Destiny new light will allow you to skip through the main campaign and go back to it when you feel like it
---
First hit level 50 if you are not yet then proceed with the new quest for THE MENAGERIE it will bring you too 690 right away then proceed with the powerful engrams.
---
Excuse me?
---
what platform are you?
---
what platform? I'm PS4
---
Apparently it’s getting a price drop but it won’t be free. I was mistaken
---
thanks, but I'm PS4
---
[removed]
---
BUT....SPICY IS GOOD.....NO?
---
Oh neat.
---
Excuse my ignorance, i used to play before Forsaken came out, my question here is. ¿Will Forsaken / Other expansions be f2p also?
---
Petition to have NASA send a Cayde-6 figurine up to the moon with them?
---
because it’s dying and this is its last breath
---
Moons haunted
---
They did that it was called armsday and flopped because Bungie doesn’t understand variety
---
What?
---
I would recommend doing whats out now with some friends (Penumbra) cause thats whats most people are gonna be doing, plus its extremely fun. Then id suggest doing the Forge content for a good Blast Furnace or Jottun since she sells all the frames. And completely skip all the Jokers Wild content cause it was made for people who bathe in sweat and smell like piss.
---
PS4 Destiny 2 Complete is 40 on NA PSN (Also in Battle.net) right now. It includes everything currently available. Sale ends on June 17th. 
---
D2 vanilla, CoO, Warmind, Forsaken and Annual Pass. 
---
From the Stream yesterday Forsaken and Annual Pass will drop to 40 after that that unless they misspoke. So its basically the same deal.

The matchmaker sucks in this game, just reverse boost and you’ll get your pubstomp lobbies back
---
It’s a simple spell, yet quite unbreakable.
---
$60 game and you're locked to level 20 lol yeah bro its entitlement sure thing
---
Shoot the bad guys.
---
That’s all I focus on and I’ve played from Vanilla Destiny 1
---
Okay thx but are you able to get the gambit prime armor still or was it something else rather then armor
---
Choosing your own win condition helps alot (ex: 6 stack vs 4 randoms but I'll focus on an aspect of my game so I can take away something instead of just being let down for 10 minutes). I think they removed shaxx's D1 lines where he isn't always so positive if your losing since it irritated people.
---
Yeah you can still get it via Reckoning, I completed the first part of the quest to unlock it so i could do it, never touched Prime again
---
Launch vanguard strikes and see what strike you have. If you got The Corrupted, then go to blind well (From strike spawn to the right) and just do bind wells till you get the pinnacle done, then if you want you can finish the strike. If you get not corrupted, then just open the director and launch vanguard strike again and do that till you get the corrupted. I recommend getting a fireteam for that, that randoms don't do the strike.   
---
If there will be The Corrupted nightfall, it will work as well, then you don't need people for that, because when you do Blind Well random people will join in Blind Well because it's is public activity.
---
Okay thx whole reason I wamted the pass was that armor
---
[You again old man?](https://imgur.com/eaiaawK)

This so hard. Any flashpoint on titan, I rally, run through the lost sector with full ammo and super, run back out and rally again before the public event starts
---
&gt;Answer these in a topic and sticky it fgs.

Didn't your Momma teach you any manners?

Try **asking** next time.

Ouch ☹️

*loading pistol* Moon’s haunted.
---
🤨?
---
What you want to buy is "the complete collection," which is $40 US on PC. This give you Forsaken plus the annual pass.
---
lmao, then they be trolling.
---
Definitely me when I got time.
---
* For Ghosts who enjoy the finer things*
---
About a week or two. Benedict has a quest that will give you some catch up gear that brings you up to power level 690, and I think the raid is doable at around 725.
---
people that buy the 35 dollares expansion on steam will have all dlc including forsaken?
---
I bought forsaken and all the rest with 35 before , do i need to pay again 35 to have the new expansion or do i have some discount?
---
Thanks for the info
---
[It follows this pattern through 2019.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/aevfwe/ascendant_challenges_through_2019)
---
Please.
---
I just wish that there was more armour customization like boots,legs,belt,chest,gloves,shoulders,and helmet were all a separate thing so if there was a cool set of shoulders but you didn’t like the rest of the arms you could mix and match and make your own unique look but that’s to much like an mmo rpg I just hope shadowkeep ups the customization options by a lot I saw a cool looking hunter in the vidoc they released for it
---
Oh I am using alternative guns obviously, but it sucks to not be able to use that gun anymore. Such a waste of time.
---
i thought it looked like a Shattered/Booped Taniks being nailed w a Thunderlord
---
Shattered from the Spec Blades tree or Booped from Boop Cannon
---
One lightbearer to rule them all
---
I would try titan out. since destiny 1 I’ve switched between maining titan and hunter multiple times and I feel like they have a more similar play style compared to warlock
---
So when I said "this comment" I wasn't referring to my own lol, but ok.
---
No, that’s bullets. it’s next to the haggis. no that’s *still* bullets. THOSE ARE THE SAME BULLETS AS BEFORE.
---
Idk I think I’m gonna stick with my hunter it’s just the aesthetic and theme of a hunter being like a rogue type character
---
Hoping for that Ballyhoo Mk. 27 hand cannon someday🤙🏽
---
My titan is really far behind my hunter and warlock though that’s the only thing
---
You sound salty dude. Did the gun hurt you?
---
Ok thanks, I thought i wouldnt be able to play the dlc till sept 19th lol
---
Ah okay that's perfect I get what you're saying. I started playing D2 I think end or mid last year. I didn't get farming the same hordes over and over (I played Division only this year) but as with Division, farming the same hordes have a chance of dropping classified, D2 didn't seem to have anything worth farming? IIRC that is.
---
My man!  
---
Sad that I have to re-download the whole game again on Steam. RIP my data.
---
Well then how can you say it’s not working if you haven’t been able to play it??
---
Going Free to Play is an admission that the numbers aren't what they would like them go be.
---
While they are giving away more than a year old content the starting point still gives you 100$ worth of content free.Some players are a little angry about it.
---
Bungie has been decidedly leaning towards more monetization from cosmetics.Somethings can only be bought with Silver now.No chance to earn them in game
---
Oh so the "hours" weren't an exaggeration huh. What's the community and lfg like? Someone mentioned you need a full team for raids.
---
I played it about 30 mins ago
---
Wait. You put a guardian on the Moon?
---
Raids aren't paid DLC? Also, what's the reward from the raids?
---
I love this game but god damn this grind is burning me out... I'm still back in black armory!
---
I got a god roll Azimuth DSu and one phased riven solo, not to mention wiped the entire enemy team in crucible with a one shot collateral
---
You were talking about the expansions, and all the expansions you boight will come with it when yiu already have them
---
Very nice. Usually my opponents just turn around and start running away. Striker is deadly uf your opponents don't realize you're coming
---
You need to have a rune in your inventory in order to launch
---
Do runes go away? I had one in the first slot and now I have nothing.
---
FUCK! Now I know what I was doing wrong! Thank you so much! Hopping into a random lfg group now to get this done.
---
Same thing happened multiple times to me whilst farming strikes for wendigo with FL last couple days... funny as hell when it happens 😂 which there was a way to be able to trigger it consistently.
---
Im a bit bummed out too last year i bought CoO and Warmind with the intention of buying forsaken now. I wonder if we will get some sort of compensation for it.
---
rice farmer
---
F
---
Not exactly a returning player per se.Just haven't played much in the last month. I have Forsaken but not the Annual Pass.If I get the Annual Pass now, what would I have missed.
---
Also I am guessing, you can't get Service Revolver anymore?Or is it part of the drop pool from Zavala?
---
No. It'll stay.
---
Ok, so where the blank areas are highlight it press a then pick your tags/add your text, go to the right of your screen where players required is and change that, then hit post, play about with the boxes and you will get the hang of it
---
D2+curse of Osiris+warmaind will be f2p.It worth noting.
---
Where do you see forsaken for $35? I bought the full but I still didn’t see that anywhere.
---
No LFG posts.
---
Read the rules.
---
It's probably a lower tier piece made for the expansion, Considering the design and colour on the default is almost nil.
---
Read the FAQ.
---
Believe it or not you're not the first returning player.
---
"stolen" we stole what they stole from us.
---
Maybe try the 5 of swords from xur, you can decrease the power handicap this way and also give yourself burn and modifiers for the nightfall to make it easier
---
😂😂
---
Theres 3 digferent ones because they get full
---
That look in the camera tho
---
Trueeeeeeeeeeeee
---
You can do it once as a kind of taster to see if it's something you'd what to purchase the pass for and jump into!

Fair enough

How you gonna do the first encounter of last wish with no communication?
---
So will the content after Year 1 *not* be going free after it release on steam?
---
1,000 bow kills, 500(?) Bow precision kills, and a percentage of medals, can be any medal for pinnacle bow
---
Let's be real, wtaf hasn't Wardcliff been nerfed? That thing is a scourge in Gambit and Crucible
---
I think you should now buy CoO on xbox digital edition and then Shadow on PC disk.  You’ll have a complete set.  Just havin’ fun.  Cheers
---
Brutal....
---
Destiny killer😂. More like.. uhh... Anthem killer
---
Could I see more of your work? Soooooo good
---
I never said they owed me anything, I asked if they mentioned anything about older players getting anything for being around for this long, like they did with the small bundle before Forsaken dropped. Chill out
---
Forsaken isn’t free yet.
---
Steam sounds real good right about now. I need a new desktop
---
Oh no I picked up the base game when it was free, just the fact I have to redownload all 90 gigs.
---
Where do you get this text?
---
Alright then, I’m gonna bookmark this post to prove you wrong when it releases. 
---
I’d go back and watch the stream again before you set this in stone.
---
Oof
---
Where did the original 'moons haunted' come from?
---
Oooh, how was that? He must’ve been fantastic in bed
---
It's apparently just marketed wrong. The new apple screen costs 6k but if you have a stand already you get 1k of the price so technically if you dont have a stand already, you pay 1k usd for the stand.
---
Read our FAQ.
---
Yeah i know but most of us want this done in 1 week and not spread it across the season. Not looking forward to this at all.
---
Older sister speaking here, I'm really glad I seem to have managed to do him justice! My brother talked quite a bit about Cayde-6 so I figured the character was quite important to him. I must admit, I was a little worried about messing this one up, so I'm real happy about all the positive feedback I'm getting here!
---
Remember death for the hive is a temporary affliction
---
This is not new information.
---
I’d pay 35$ for the raids alone
---
That's awesome
---
Thank you! 
---
((I'm planning on it, but I always take ages to get used to new gameplays, so I've got that project planned for my next semester break so I can binge plat it without having to worry about evil deadlines))
---
The funny part is it is Bioware’s fault, not EA’s.
---
I was fine until now.
---
Well they just lost one new player, now I’m judging waiting till they make the free to play. Kinda pissed about it because before I uninstalled it I had a good time.
---
Is that 2 hours lol
---
He always wears a helmet because he secretly has a grenade for a head.
---
Sure is chief, pretty impressive time eh?
---
That grenade is difficult to use properly. It's not a sticky or a tracking grenade so it's easy to dodge.
---
Lol sure is you guys treated that like a raid for the first time lol
---
I wasn't sure I knew whoever pops it wouldn't die from experience.
---
Hammerhead. 21 can't even touch hammerhead.
---
Sorry, maybe I forgot to clarify, the five of swords is a modified card you can get from xur to modify the contents of the nightfall, not an actual nightfall. So it modifies the nightfall you’re in, the one you mentioned where you click vanguard and it’s on the right. Xurs on the Nessus barge if you don’t have it yet. Again, sorry if I forgot to clear that up.
---
I’ve seen a few level 20s get one shotted pretty bad... if there in a good place I’ll Rez them. Sometimes they get blasted again and get rezkilled. I do it again. Does this make me a bad person.

That’s the way! (Aha aha)

What about Panoptes?  He was a big dude.
---
No. Not it doesn't. I do that in the menagerie. When ogres and knights start to fuck our shit up

I don't think it's that important whether you start now or later. The question is, do you want to play now or play later.

It’s the other way around
---
Oh you got killed? Here lemme rez you from my safe spot so you can die again!
---
There is supposed to be a $40 USD purchase that gives you Forsaken + annual pass. It took a few hours to appear in the PC store, and I have heard PS4 players say you fellows don't have that one listed yet in the PS4 store, so I would say wait for that situation to be resolved.

farming GL kills for the wendigo.

Oh ok then

pfff, mine came in a lame simple box. i feel scammed now :(

What you want to buy is the battle net complete collection. 
---
Shadowkeep is currently not sold on its own, I have heard someone say this is because game DLC can't be sold on steam if the base game is also not available there, so that $35 is for Shadowkeep plus other stuff that you don't need if you have the $40 version.
---
ahh great. thanks for the reply!
---
Forsaken fixed all of those problems that the base game had.
---
Like an EA game will ever be better than a Bungie game. The Bungie team can take a crap and it's a better game than EA could ever dream of making.
---
He was so easy but fun. you could even solo his entire raid like I did once.
---
As far as I know, that was mostly speculation based on how Activision and Bungie had a contract for Bungie to make 3 games. That contract no longer exists.
---
It's a pain, just keep grinding the bounties and it will eventually give it
---
I remember when it launched it definetly made me play less destiny for about a week, when I got to lvl 30 and finished the campaign, did the all the strongholds came back to destiny cause there was nothing left to do. Not even PvP gamemodes... Imagine if destiny was just public events campaign and nightfalls.
---
and then their fight goes off screen
---
So does Recluse.  And the other pinnacles are mostly models from D1
---
excuse me?
---
I hope so. My luck it will drop on a non main character lol
---
that’s Thalnok, Crota’s Fanboy
---
*Sniffles at the beauty and memories*
---
I don’t think enough people have it yet due to the new season and such as more people get it I think it will be in the spotlight similar to mountaintop (people knew it was insane but it took more time to acquire then any other pinnacle weapon).
---
There’s a LOT of sleeping give that we are waking up
---
Still need someone? How far through the quest are you?
---
Im sure that it is difficult to do, and I do see your point, but I’m no way does this look like someone who’s basically immortal zipping around the galaxy laying waste to different life forms that threaten our own existence. Dude belongs on a farm lol
---
I more so mean hype in terms of weapons people are going after.   There are also way more reviews for hush and revoker.   Maybe its just the crowd I talk to/follow that isn’t focused on it 🤷🏾‍♂️
---
Just go into a nightfall.
---
Does the FAQ stickied to the subreddit not help you?
---
It's not playable yet on steam, it should say "preorder" on the steam page. It will be playable on steam September 17th as stated on the bungie website.
---
My pursuits tab is so crowded. Should I just abandon all the ritual and things from forsaken, I have about 20 of them.
---
They do somewhat. It consists of two kinds of players: Those who have never played Destiny and seem to think that Warframe is vastly superior and those who have played Destiny and realise that both are good and actually fill different niches despite both being looter shooters
---
I think its because of the lighting. Still cool though
---
Battlefront 2 is actually in a really good state right now with plenty more content drops on the way
---
Don't let Bad Dragon see this...
---
Worked out the confusion, if you buy the collection from retail in a physical version you don't get the annual pass, if you buy from the PS store you do, hence the price difference. 😁😁
---
balls
---
Check out the Ishtar collective website. It has all the lore from both D1 and D2.
---
Should I just delete it,take out the disc and then install it again because it isn’t there
---
Does the FAQ stickied to this subreddit not help? Does the Bungie "the future of this game" post not help? 
---
The first question is basically a "we'll tell you the details later" answer according to the Bungie website. Unclear about the second one, all we know is that all your purchases and progress will transfer to steam.
---
Just found my next cell phone wallpaper. Thank you!
---
Well that’s unfortunate. Would’ve been nice if they just released a forsaken + season pass combo for cheaper.
---
Except Anthem actually wasnt EA's fault (a surprise for sure, but its the truth)
---
Bioware, in the six years the game was in development didnt actually really start to develop the game till the last 18 months. They didnt even have an actual name for the game till the day that they showed it off at E3. Instead of trying to design a game healthily with good timing and not overworking your employees. Bioware decided to rely on their "Bioware magic" and hope that the game would just come together all by itself in the end.
---
Theres a whole post-mortem post that kotaku's Jason Schieier did and it completely shows that Bioware just didnt know what they were doing.
---
Are the Vex the strongest out of the enemies? The Hive and the Taken seem to compete.... but then again the Cabal and Fallen/Scourge whatever's took a lot from us
---
Download the updates and click "play" ;)
---
The only thing that you may not figure out in the course of playing is that Benedict in the Tower has a quest that gives 690 power level catch up gear. If you own the annual pass, this introduces one of the new activities. If you do not own the annual pass, this lets you have one free trial run of the activity after giving you the 690 gear.
---
I would never trust you with any amount of money, apparently you have zero idea how not having deadlines can create a situation of spending significantly more money than necessary.
---
After this much time, Anthem should not be in a pre-alpha form.  The fault isn't the deadline.  It's the fact that Bioware pissed away their time and wasted a shit ton of cash.
---
I replied to you main comment. But for some reason I feel compelled to say this again. Anthem was definitely not EA's fault. It was all Biowares fault.
---
Yeah? And?
---
In what regard? How would it be unfair?
---
My bad. Thanks
---
Cool
---
You forgot to also add how much lmg spam there is and the flinch on pulse rifles
---
Um, ok? Sorry I dont understand why people are posting these... its just killing 99 enemies with drang right?
---
Just know circles = good and triangles = bad
---
To be fair there are a lot of lore videos but CROTA is a hecken D1 Boss and very special to a lot of vets
---

Thanks

Use what your good with and meta weapons
---
No, only for destiny 2 new light.
---
Yes it's wonderful though because they all deal enhan Ed damage
---
I miss the bonds from d1 I used to have the eagle one I also miss artifacts I had felwinters artifact u lose heavy but gain additional grenade and melee
---
This was me. I was lucky to have buddies guide me through Curse of Osiris and Warmind after I beat the maib campaign and show me just how much I was missing out on and what I could really do in the game (I didn’t understand simple things like infusion, nor did I bother looking them up because I was a filthy casual). At the time, there wasn’t much to do, except weekly milestones, but without that, I don’t know if I would have played through Forsaken and beyond.
---
Visual pun
---
Was this said in the red room?
---
Seems more likely you'll need to buy the content for each platform, but can cross save progress/drops
---
Oh god please no.
---
Just go with what you like the most bro, even if it's only the aspect of the character, every class is good in general, just play with the 3 of them and then decide on which you wanna choose as your main, all of them feel great in game, you just have to be comfortable with your pick. Btw I was a warlock main in Destiny 1 and I still have one as my secondary character in Destiny 2! And yes exotics are very good for the warlock, for example if you like playing PVP this season you got the Astrocite Verse exotic helmet which is pretty OP in PVP!! But you great ones for PVE as well!!
---
what's the point in stadia? i heard it's just a pc platform that requires a subscription fee as well as purchasing your games.
---
Check under pursuits. The location of mission items and bounties has changed since SoO came out.
---
I will grant you the means of true power
---
Not user 1 that has forsaken. Refer to collections book for gear, their season of origin, and to see if you have guns with random rolls.
---
Yes, exotics can always be reaquired
---
People need to down vote this
---
It took them months to redesign their initial intent of monetize progression with loot boxes.
---
With this hint of the Vex severely holding back on us comes with an implication in the writing. Why bring that up if it won't happen at any point. With the coming of the darkness and the rumors of dark guardians I feel like the Light, Darkness, and Vex have a lot coming
---
That wizard came from the moon!
---
I know that, I said it was in a good state now, not that it was never in a bad state.
---
I ended last season at 2900 after a rank reset
---
Look how they massacred my boy!
---
Base Game will be free September 17 warmind and Osiris will also be free. Sounds like you might only have to buy any further content once.
---
Get the raid weapons. May not be the absolute best out there but the experiences you have along the way are worth the journey. And they play and look unique
---
Gtfo scrub
---
I dare say it turned out pretty well, though.
---
Super regen speeds are increased in a tie break round at the end of gambit, that and you using shards could have been why you got your super so quick
---
But the super was one after another, less than 3s down time. Maybe two shards going off alternatively would work?
---
No just cross save so what ever account you choose will be your complete main
---
I play on 3 accounts (Hunter Titan and Warlock) each class has its benefits and it’s down sides. Any character is helpful in different places in the game. Warlocks tens it be really good at killing smaller to mid size enemy’s and playing a semi support class. I’m forsaken warlocks got a new super that is a massive healing rift that amps up yours and other players damage but does not do direct damage.  If you are looking to get into difficult multiplayer based games I would suggest warlock. If you’re playing solo for the most part all classes are enjoyable.
---
Aaah. I use dawnblade all the time in gambit. Army of one medal almost guaranteed every invasion with super
---
Not anymore my friend 😭
---
Crota, Son of Oryx, Killer of Eris Morns Friends
---
I'm so f-blam!-ing dead rn I just can't with you.
---
Ugh dead orbit ffs
---
That's exactly it. You don't need any hard ware other than the screen, internet, and a controller device (m&amp;KB compatible)
---
Ok. Thanks
---
New title:
---
Crota, Son of Oryx, Killer of Eris Morns Freinds
---
10mb/s minimum, that's pretty attainable.
---
#WHERE
---
Yup. You could in theory run Destiny at 144hz 4k on a crappy laptop because none of the rendering and heavy lifting is done by your machine. The appeal will be for people who travel often as they could play AAA games on a Chromebook or something provided they have a good data plan.
---
Any ideas on how to make it easier?
---
If you do decide to go for it, msg me on here. I play on ps and am always looking for more people to play with.
---
Am interested. Subscribed and thank you!
---
everything red in that area turns orange idk why proboably lighting
---
Ohh thanks man. Will see what I decide
---
Nice.
---
Why does every post that try’s to uplift the community always ends up with a guy like in the comments u don’t have to such a pessimistic fuck just enjoy they trying to fix the game or get tf out the comments and don’t say oh “well I’ve been here since destiny 1 and it was way better” but If u took a look at d1 too had problems it doesn’t matter how long u supported them In the passed it only matters that ur hating on them now.

These are in game images that I modified and filtered to give them a pastel kind of look. NOT ORIGINAL DRAWN ART
---
Smh
---
Thanks! Check out the others if you get the chance, since you somehow managed to beat me to the comments ;p you sly dog...
---
So sweet
---
Professional lurker, I see all posts.
---
I could never play D1 because it wasn't on PC. The coolness of whatever Crota is is lost on me.
---
If they buffed the damage, I'd play more Code of Commander in Crucible. Starting this season I started using my Hunter in Crucible because of the mobility aspect, but a buff to Thundercrash would let my Titan out with a vengeance.
---
There is no reason to wait for Forsaken. Forsaken is not available for purchase on Steam right now regardless, so if you want to play it now you can, and you will not have to rebuy it on Steam, it will transfer over
---
Ok
---
ASD, ESL, or JDA?
---
Yeah, because the players of new light guardians wouldn't be able to handle how destroyed they are.
---
No I know it’s not free but when I try to purchase it it says I have it installed?
---
Ah, I see.  
---
Thank you for the quick reply!
---
outstanding move
---
A horse.
---
Lmao implying the moon isn't haunted cause the hive already live there.
---
Wake up sheeple
---
It is that certain shade of blue 😂
---
I skipped most of the last two seasons and just came back this week. Over 100 Mayhem matches and a bunch of new quests later I do not regret my choice. Definitely check it out again.
---
noice
---
It is indeed part of the wishender quest
---
Ok thx
