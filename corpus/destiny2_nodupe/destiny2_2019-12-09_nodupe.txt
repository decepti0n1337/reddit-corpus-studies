In her defense, life in the Destinyverse essentially consists of reeling from one existential threat to the next with brief breaks to celebrate holidays... most of which commemorate a prior existential threat.  If she let herself get bent out of shape about every little Cabal invasion or moon haunting, she'd never get anything done.

If you have already messed it up, leave the lost sector and come back and it will reset. Then follow a YouTube video of the sequence.
---
Also: Me knowing exactly who Saint-14 is and not caring for the hype at all.
---
I just wantdead cliffs back!!
---
I am one of those who are happy to see them gone and hope they never return.

Does it get lower effort than this?

It does actually. ‚ÄúDestiny is like the Star Wars version  to Halo‚Äù

I tried that
---
Poor kinderguardians haven't discovered the way
---
After two full days straight of momentum control I hate all the maps right now.
---
Literally the only time I've gotten disconnected randomly when it wasn't something on my end was the other day when the D2 servers took a dump and we were ALL aware it was a problem on their end that day because people lost their shit when the servers were down for several hours. Not everyone is having a problem. If not your router specifically, it could be an issue with your ISP or something going on with the routing.
---
this isn't needed in any capacity. The game is rated T for Teen, not M for mature.
---
No
---
That Bovine Champion wiped my fireteam in the Scarlet Keep
---
But do you have Recluse &amp; Mountaintop
---
Tbh I don‚Äôt mind if warlock melee just gets a speed buff, but I think it‚Äôd be cool if it got more range instead, like in D1. Then again, I sometimes get flashbacks to 20km Warlock melee range from D1, so maybe not üòÇ
---
It says I have recluse. and I'm working on my mountaintop
---
Forgot the worn out left analog stick.
---
How the fuck is more words less effort
---
Don't forget to open them in a fireteam! Gives you more xp!
---
So good
---
Hardcore as in similar to hardcore health and damage w/ no radars in other games like Battlefield and CoD and Halo
---
Well then I have no clue
---
Shocked that it's happening at all, but for once I'm going to agree with everyone else in this thread. It's not the Hunter, you just need to keep learning your abilities. If you feel like your Golden Gun is bad with just 3 shots, play Outlaw. You want your knife to do more damage? Practice your moving aim in PvE or keep trying in pvp. Try hitting guardians directly with your nightstalker, anchor will do more damage and slow them immediately. I've heard the Forsaken tree has been the better alternative for Arc hunters since Roaming super armor was removed. You just have to keep trying. Unless you're on console, the game isn't going to play itself on pvp. Invest some mats into mods from Banshee or the Black Armory, make sure to actually apply the right ones based on your loadout. I'm still a pvp trashcan, but I can still dumpster a shotgun titan if I just aim better before he reaches me. Just play smarter, don't immediately assume it's game balance
---
Especially when those extra words jut make my brain hurt more.
---
A bigger damage buff doesn't really make Titans better than Warlocks. It means that at most you want to bring one Titan so everyone else can dance in and out of a bubble. Any other titans than that is overkill. We don't do near comparable damage with any of our supers and almost all of them force us to get into Boss Stomp range. They showed some of the Titan buffs to Sunbreaker in a tweet two days ago. It was painful to watch an entire super bar *barely* almost kill a tier 1 Escalation Protocol boss. Meanwhile Warlocks and Hunters get really cool DPS specs that do a lot of damage and come with exotics that either buff the damage of, or return a lot of super after they use it.

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Titans are objectively the worst in PvE. It's the price we seem to pay for being better in PvP.

Well, in Halo 4-5‚Äôs time, Humanity‚Äôs one of if not the most powerful empires in the known galaxy.  Presumably at the end of Halo 6, humanity will fully assume the Mantle of Responsibility and begin integrating more and more forerunner tech.
---
No cheats or bots or hacks. They were just suiciding. There's a few reasons they might. In order to lower there glory or even what the game considers their skill, for matchmaking. Or they have something that requires comp game completions and just want it over with. Ex redrix has a step where you need 25 comp matches, 25 quickly matches and 25 rumble matches.

Yes, you do. In order to get the undying seal, everything needed has to be done this season, which includes the collections badge for this season.
---
Props to Steve Downes for getting that quiet desperation in the Chief's voice in 4 when it came to Cortana. My only beef with H4 is that you need to read some books for context, and vidya gaem based novels tend to be Hit or Miss.

I'm proud to say that you're my second favourite artist. ^The ^first ^is ^a ^very ^close ^friend ^of ^mine

BUT YOU'RE ON THE LIST
---
Or the bounties
---
&gt; 5 levels on each character
---
It's five levels account-wide not per character
---
So far all LMGs are only attainable through either a quest or bounty (except for maybe the thunderlord?). The easiest one I can think of is a LMG frame from Ada-1 at the tower
---
Yea actually. Did you see the bottom of the video?
---
Oh it‚Äôs cool, that makes more sense.
---
Most faction armor sets are based off of locational armor sets. For example, dead orbit gear was the same as the EDZ or Vanguard sets currently.

You need to finish the intro quests for gambit then it should show up in Drifters inventory

---
Probably not. They'd become taken, and then we'd be fucked
---
Is it I never noticed. I know it used to be 3 levels per character in y1. You'd think I'd notice after 270 levels this season lmao.
---
They are story missions, so yeah, but I would accept only 1 at a time, starting from red war.
---
Do you mean the video of the scanning the pod and giving us the dialogue
---
Yep, it's only those 5 that are easier the rest are all earned the hard way. I probably wouldn't have noticed either if I hadn't read the TWAB prior to launch. 270 is a decent number. I just hit 261 myself.
---
I didn‚Äôt lose 1, and I didn‚Äôt reach the cap. Look, I know this post is kind of stupid but I‚Äôm just frustrated with the state of crucible. I got all the way to 5400 and have been on a losing streak for the last 3 days. There‚Äôs so much I could complain about. SO MUCH. Don‚Äôt even get me started on ghost melees. There are so many problems with crucible and with the release of a new season the only things changing are recluse getting nerfed (the big thing) and then subclass additions n shit. Yes, to anybody reading this I know it‚Äôs a shitpost but you cannot tell me you have never dealt with bullshit in crucible.
---
Ya I feel 100k per level is very fair but only if your efficient with bounties.
---
quick update for myself... I am on precision final blow. I hope the guy who invented this quest put his mom to do it. She will love like she loves his son =) (too harsh maybe but idc)
---
Man you‚Äôre not alone I was in mythic 3 and i dipped to 2 because of ‚Äúdisconnections‚Äù I restarted my game and everything was fine besides me getting demoted
---
100% Agree
---
Warlocks have a exotic that give wallhacks btw still funny tho
---
Better question, is why at 180 glory, am I matched with people in the 4-5k range?
---
BRO CAN WE JUST GET A DESTINY MOVIE ALREADY. LIKE IN FIRST PERSON SO IT APPLIES TO EVERYONE. JEEZE MAN. WERE WAITING
---
What‚Äôs bottom left it‚Äôs too dark and I can‚Äôt see it?
---
Nvm I just had brightness set to the lowest it could be
---
Ohh thanks for the help
---
This is amazing! (Read it in the shaxx voice). But seriously, keep it up and don't stop working hard.
---
Hand in planet material to the vendor (in this case ana bray), until you have claimed 8 engrams then you can just buy the armor.
---
Any time mate
---
Homie it looks cool asf you could totally do whatever you want in any art department
---
Thats a good thing
---
Yeah, it's Quria.
---
Dont feel bad dude. My warlock has the wrong color of face paint and it makes me so mad. But its my first ever character so i cant reset him.
---
Yea im confused too
---
Got it, can I cross save from Xbox to pc? As far as I know, my Xbox account isn‚Äôt linked to an official account
---
Grind moon bounties you nut
---
One of the best scores in any game, imo
---
The crimson days picture also has sparrows
---
Log out and log back in
---
I believe weapon quests carryover. Getting the Undying seal will not.
---
Now because of momentum control
---
Yes I do agree Salad Head can be a dick
---
i need to pay more attention when i run it with friends to figure out  the patter, soon
---
C'mon bruh
---
I say this with absolutely no disrespect to you OP (great job popping off!) but god as a PC player it is so hard to watch console clips sometimes. I don‚Äôt know how you guys do it...
---
He must've not run the dungeon yet
---
Grind momentum control?
---
Trying that now
---
I think so too. Just wanna be sure
---
Gotta be careful around those nigthmares.
---
That's an interesting wish, wouldn't you say, o redditor mine?
---
Ah yes a repost with a mildly different caption

Really well done
---
That worked. Thank you.
---
I think it's just the theme of the event that they are going for. Like the one in the back (which is from last year) has a sleigh theme so I think that it just looks like a snowmobile because of the theme
---
Also those are skis not treads
---
Did you ever figure this out? It‚Äôs happening to me right now too.
---
I'm not saying shoulder charge is op but its easier to pull off than lining up a headshot with a throwing knife. A shotgun isnt going to a shoulder charge 100% of the time with latency allowing you to trade and if you want to counter the throwing knife just dont run in a straight line and mix up you movement. Its also a million times easier to shift w melee than it is to hit a knife crit. Idk how low your elo is but that might be why you think thats easier.

It‚Äôs really intended as a group activity. I‚Äôm 933 and just finished level 7 with a group of 5 or 6 guardians that were around.

Hey just looked into it and couldn‚Äôt find any link to submit to. Any chance you could point it out.

No but i bought shadow keep standard on both Xbox and PC.

Great work keep it up

You need at least 3 more people

Same as thorium holt. God the helmet is garbage.
---
Must have been blueberries
---
Destiny 1 low lever hunter armor was a thousand times better than the jeans and boots you wear in Destiny 2.
---
I don‚Äôt agree with the whole people aren‚Äôt obligated to teach.... if he was paired up with a group in guided games those teams are searching to GUIDE someone through the raid not to be a bunch of dicks and expect him to know the encounters, that‚Äôs such a shitty thing to do.
---
I could understand if he joined an lfg group asking for someone that kwtd and he joined that without knowing  but he didn‚Äôt and that just unacceptable.
---
I thought it was chalk!! But I also  attended an art festival yesterday so the white border of the triangle looked  wry similar to me. You are incredibly skilled And I love this piece!

I like how your Duke gets smashed as well on your second death.

It‚Äôs a step in the right direction

Weird maybe a glitch?
---
I got Undying, Harbinger, Enlightened, and Unbroken all in the same week (week of the last raid challenge). All of that while balancing a full time job/being a full time student. All is good!
---
I‚Äôm definitely gonna take it easier during season of the dawn though. Admittedly, I did no-life D2 a bit this season, but it was worth it.
---
Possibly.
---
Remove the wallhack and nerf the overshield a little. ez
---
:(
---
you‚Äôre so young and so talented, i can‚Äôt even imagine what this would look like, redone by you years from now.
---
Wave 2 is just hard because the final boss has a billion hp, but its pretty easy from then on especially if you're a nova warlock, but if you got atleast 3 ppl or more it becomes a piece of cake
---
A pyramid.... Well shit
---
I use striker with that helmet that gives you super when you‚Äôre wounded and I‚Äôm pretty okay with that
---
You trade them into Ikora for plans for the Vex offensive weapons.
---
But they will be going away tomorrow whennit goes down for maintenance.
---
They didn't stand a chance.
---
Why do I literally feel that in my bones
---
This meme is dumb. The vanguard would know exactly who Saint-14 is. He's a fucking legend.
---
You can hold 63 quests and bounties combined on each char. Both tabs are added, so I guess OP has 20 Quests and maxes out the number of bounties which is 43.
---
My first toon is a female awoken warlock. My buddy and I jokingly call her "Goth Queen" or "Gothlock" because that is what she is: darkest grey skin, white eyes, black hair and black lipstick. I am not the biggest fan of her hair when I saw it had some weird metal bits om the back (Bungie please let use rotate characters in the initial creation so I can see the hair from ALL angles rather than directly ahead). Regardless, she is my first toon and my main in which I have done most of my splo play and exotic quests. I cannot get rid of her just to change her hair.
---
It‚Äôs at 666 upvotes I really don‚Äôt want to break that but damn u deserve an upvote
---
I just got Risk and for a smg it's pretty awesome. I'm not even a smg fan. Normally hate them lol
---
It will stay at 666 in my heart.
---
Your own work makes it look slightly forsaken and that's just dope
---
Shit, this is gonna hurt
---
ah yes, the father of all titan apes
---
Hopefully they do great armor
---
Don't try to impress me, just get better!
---
750 is now the minimum power level and you cannot start from 0 anymore. The story is the exact same except you no longer receive an exotic weapon from Asher. Hope you enjoy the story!
---
It does but you lose all the season pass multipliers (makes it like 5x as much progress per event)
---
Idk what all is going on
---
I bough standard and got deluxe edition anyways so I‚Äôm confused asf
---
I got 36 exotics (started playing about a month and a half ago)
---
I think Fated Engrams are normal world/random drops. It‚Äôs his rotating stock that seems to still have collections rolls.
---
Ooohhh about that
---
Im titan because i think the Hunter jump sucks on stadia
---
Attunement of Grace wants a word
---
I‚Äôve gotten duplicates and I don‚Äôt have anywhere near all the possible world exotics - weapons or armor. I thought duplicate protection was coming next season for Fated Engrams?
---
That's when you pull out a sniper and pop them as they run at you feeling invincible.
---
Ok, thanks!
---
You can but you will get progress at a slower rate
---
Makes sense, thanks!
---
No I get that that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying you have to time it right it‚Äôs just a learning curve to it I had it on console but after switching to pc it‚Äôs another learning curve
---
Grats!
---
you have fallen my brother we must purge the unclean. the inquasition has ordered an extermanatus of the entire planet.
---
Try melle ability on the boss?
---
Sorry mate didn‚Äôt saw it I‚Äôll explain it when I‚Äôll be in home ! Having a class now
---
how do you even buy them?
---
Does she have no morals no emotions no humanity
---
No. But it'd cost you 30 bucks.
---
People of different preferences. Anything that requires a precision hits/kills to proc is a minus to me. Anything that is slide-related is trash to me. Snapshot sight speeds up your ads for like 2 frames.
---
For real.    Lol.
---
Maybe o am misunderstanding your question, but you can look at a full list in the collection book and it will tell you were to grind.
---
Guardian: "Hey Xur, I'd like to buy a random exotic please."
---
Xur *Out of ideas looking around the room and notices your Sweet Business* "Um here, the gods of fate have determined that you get a Sweet Business!"
---
I don‚Äôt mind the price too much, just wanted to make sure it wouldn‚Äôt be a lot more
---
You can only do 2 a week. After doing two, those become the only ones you can do again for re rolls until reset.
---
Oh I see thanks
---
100 Silver ($1) per rank.
---
oh dang thanks!
---
Bungie isn't helping here, they should steer people into doing Red War gently but firmly as they start playing. Having that context helps.
---
psn: iggsauce i‚Äôd be glad to help out!
---
Pretty sure last season they took uncollected bounties off people to stop ranking up so fast on first day.
---
Nope, the stuff I've gotten from fated has had good stats. The stuff you can buy for 29 is garbage (except that it's an Exotic, so thus not garbage). 
---
I got a PvP robe, I forget its name, for my Warlock this week. The stats on it were great, the perks on it utterly useless for me, but it was 60+ 
---
I'll probaly shard it...
---
This grind is just brutal.
---
F
---
This is amazing.
---
Yeah, buy the visible ones first, and then the engram. However, the ones you got will have had much better stats than the one you could have gotten for 29, so it may not be a waste after all. The visible ones for 29 have the most base collection-level stats, armor will be something like 48 tops. The engrams will drop something more appropriate to your level most likely, my robe was over 60.
---
But did it have a good roll!?
---
Here‚Äôs the thing, I don‚Äôt agree at all. I fully understand he has a limited amount of time. I‚Äôm saying rather than waste it and potentially not finish, he should devote 30 mins to an hour on a divinity last checkpoint lfg to get a weapon that will make getting the nightfall finished much easier.
---
Im not farming anything, don‚Äôt talk about what you don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve done master once and never gone in again. I wasted days trying to get it done with my team using other methods, but when we took an hour to grab our stuff it made the NF trivial.
---
No one ever needs to do what you do and just slug through it for a million hours. Just budget for the lfg and have it done by noon.
---
Psn: Spookynrd
---
I‚Äôll team up with you, just add me
---
At 63% now. I completely forgot about the fact that everyone is weak, despite 1 tapping with jade rabbit for the 450th time. i spent over 4500 gunsmith materials for a good erentil :p. Good thing i saw this before i spent more. Thank you so much.
---
Two armor exotics in my case at the moment, Nezerac's Sin for a grenade and super spamming Warlock build, or Getaway Artist arms for Arc for a floating arc soul turret that travels with me. Every other exotic armor piece I have is just hugely inferior to either but I don't remotely have them all so...
---
Same with guns, just a few that I fire up routinely, the others are situational or just inferior.
---
Huh, come to think of it, I'd better do that last strike for mine today before tomorrow's reset, just in case.
---
Red War is pretty short, so try to at least play through it and Curse of Osiris. At the end of CoO, you'll get access to "Prophecy Weapons" from the Mercury Faction NPC. Do a few of them, until you get one that requires you to do a mission before you can forge the item. Finish said mission and get your weapon to be all caught up on the story for Season of Dawn. Hopefully with that you should at least be whatever minimum pwr bungie decides to make the seasonal activity
---
luckily im not a bad rager, the most id ever do is just say 'i fucking hate you *****' in a angry but calm manner, rarely if im really annoyed i bust out cheesy weapons (i have no idea if lord of wolves us good in pvp but from what ive used its aight). i mean i could try and learn how to snipe cause its not an easy thing to do so ill see how that plays out for me
---
Lol.    I hate that.
---
Sure, but if they like playing with it, let them. Save the meta for raids
---
Sniping is so fun man lol. Oh yeah also use emotes to peak around corners. That should have been the first thing i said lol. Yeah if you wanna peak a lane but do wanna risk dying then just use an emote so you arent at risk
---
They seem to have put Osiris on a path of redemption in Season of Dawn. I actually enjoy reading about him now. Also, Pujari, Aunor ( somewhat ), Felwinter and Preadyth are pretty cool too, either because they have interesting stories or because they kick ass ( Felwinter and Aunor may be assholes, but they still kick(ed) ass )
---
Asher is campy, which in my opinion works for him and makes his dialogue pretty funny, especially since his voice actor did a pretty good job.
---
Could always try with the fine folks at r/photoshopbattles
---
You have not come off well in this thread.
---
I've seen alteast 5 memes with the same pic of 2 vex
---
does the 30 fps really affect sniping? cause compared to other games its feel really odd to me (yet again destiny is its own game so thats probably a factor
---
Is it? I haven't know that
---
It certainly looks like they where a nine man Fireteam that died in the strike, but for all we know the amount of Hive in there may have been much larger beforehand. Hell, maybe one of Savath√ªn's generals was in there too, that peaced the fuck out when the Shrieker was in place for us to destroy it ( it was probably a trap. We were probably meant to kill the thing )
---
Waga tamashi wa muda moetae ru
---
I used telesto, prety funny how you can make traps for ppl
---
HORY shet
---
Don't listen that much to what other people say. There is clearly an overreaction about OEM or recluse because people can't accept that been killed is a part of the game. In actual gameplay they're simply good but by no means they don't make you a better player. Everything needs skill.
---
As others said, pick the build that fits your play style even if other people dislike it. Personally what made me better was the fact I learned the maps, became faster at ADS, along with better use of the radar. In terms of loadout, I've tried many things and hands down my favourite kinetic is pulse rifles. I used the highly underrated vigilance wing but lately I use a lot a curated blast furnace I got. As for energy it depends highly on the map, for some cases snipers are a no go...
---
Wha-
---
If you need a Playstation bud to round out the 3, slide into my DMs and I can help out &lt;3
---
Because you‚Äôre already on the next step somehow, the keys are used at the beginning where the mysterious box hasn‚Äôt been opened yet and has 4 slots for keys and a different visual icon. From looking at the icon you gave for the actual exotic quest, you are already past this step but somehow have the keys still. If I may ask, what does your actual quest step say?
---
Yall are going to be so disappointed its crazy. Every single time
---
I have Izanagis now bro. This screenshot is a month old from when I first encountered the problem. Still have the keys.
---
i tried to fo yhat the oyger day because i noticed thete was a small floating island above the pyramidion strike entrance and wanted to see what was up yhere. I didnt make it :(
---
Just dismantle the main step then, because you still have the quest
---
Yea , I use it on occasion I‚Äôm just not the biggest void subclass fan ...stormcaller is just too dope for me to not use !! I love it way too much
---
No I don't. I completed the quest. Like I said this screenshot is a month old.
---
I honestly still don't know how any of that works...
---
Been playing \~500h on steam by now and have never seen anyone write in chat. Even when I thought I'd figured it out. Last week I sat down with a friend and tried to get it to work and after some fiddeling, I could see his chat massages in local. Noone else wrote anything though. So i'm not really sure I made it work.

I like how there's no sign of help on the way, then a group of dudes walk out of a store and restrain him, then suddenly there's 40 people there in an instant.
---
Vigilance wing is one of the most underrated weapons in the game. In pvp this thing is amazing, it's a 5 round burst and it has this perk for healing plus overshield when a nearby teammate is killed. I haven't try Outbreak Perfected yet but I consider VW as the best exotic pulse rifle.
---
where is tess? seems she is at some farm, i have no clue where that is, cant find it anywhere

I started on Wednesday with my warlock then Titan and then hunter, I finished them all yesterday night. Once you finish a bounty there is no time for ‚Äò‚Äôdisappear‚Äô‚Äô so you can pretty much hold like 8 or more dailys of the same vendor
---
Awesome, thanks, that explains all, at least post factum! Also, your generosity makes you an avatar of selflessness, a living hero!
---
:insert\_suitable\_emoticon:
---
I like this one...
---
yeah...Tuesday is certainly my day-off from Destiny....

Santa and one titans are complete opposites
---
One brings joy while the other brings death and sadness
---
probably at weekly reset time, same as shadow keep release time.
---
I don‚Äôt know that I could sit and hold these for that long. It‚Äôs like knowing you have voicemail/emails and not checking them. I have to open them and see what I got. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
yeah... but still i've got it finally. Pretty happy about it
---
Congrats
---
I was just thinking this, man, we are assholes ;)
---
Taking the high road with comments like that then privately apologising. All I have to say is you went personal, you say you did not want to go to vulgar on a children friendly reddit but yet said what you did.
---
I did not report your comment and it sure as hell didn't take me 24 hrs to think of a response.
---
Again you haven't upset me, you were the first to comment about a statement I  made ergo I upset you causing a retort.
---
You say I'm immature for calling you out for your grammar but again this was the main foundation of your "savage reply". I sure don't want to get on the wrong side of you.
---
Call me out on MY manhood... Jeez. Your not so bright. Why do a private apology when your quite happy publicly "duke it out".
---
I'm not angry or frustrated, in fact I'm quite the opposite and amused at your attempts to get at me. All my digs were solely return fodder but hey you go on about your day. I do fear I have out done you but the only last word I want is the sweet sweet hand cannon on my hip.
---
I honestly could do this for hours because you have complete jack and it's nice to know that at least guardian out there is thicker than uldron.
---
Peace
---
and my axe!
---
Yea ik :)

F2P (New Light) gives you Red War (base game), Curse of Osiris &amp; Warmind (Y1 season DLCs), Gambit, Gambit Prime, Reckoning, Menagerie, all crucible maps, all strikes,the forges, all Y1 raids and exotic weapon quests.  So everything you purchased and a little more.
---
Forsaken is Y2 and had an annual pass that could be purchased, instead of seasons.  You DO NOT get Forsaken, Y2 raids, or Y2 exotic quest lines with F2P.  You must purchase Forsaken to get those things.  There were several exotics that may make it worth purchasing (especially since it is on sale for Christmas right now).
---
Shadowkeep is Y3's DLC and has 4 seasons associated with it Season of Undying ends Tuesday, Season of Dawn begins Tuesday, and there will be 2 more seasons available.  F2P gives you the first mission os Shadowkeep, but no other Shadowkeep content.  With F2P you can get seasonal rewards and the seasonal artifact, but you cannot get the Season Pass holder's rewards, you can not do the season pass activities (Undying was the Vex Offensive), and you do not get the seasonal exotic quests.
---
Noice! I just need legend for forgotten and I'm kosher, save for the broadsword.
---
When you see a hunter walk in with nighthawk
---
I did not expect a dong expansion on this sub, thanks OP
---
Cranking Dance and The one with dropping the rose or something.
---
Cranking is just the best in every situation and the rose is for dropping on insourmontable skullfort titans bodies in comp
---
Yup. Thanks bud!
---
But Shaxx fuxx with the helmet on...
---
Upvoted
---
[Serious] Can someone give me a run down on the quality of the game since bungie split from Activision and shadow keep came out? I played alot in forsaken and I see the digital edition is 25% off. I spent alot on the kids and cant blow money like I used to and want to know if it's a good purchase. 
---
(I'm not asking is the game good but more how its changed)
---
Thank you
---
Well now i understand. Of course a good/bad fireateam can make a world differance im Destiny ur right. Nevertheless i would say putting Garden more towards the easier bracket just cuz u had a great fireteam (which really rarely happens tbh) is a bit misleading imo. I think when someone asks what‚Äôs the hardest raid and whats the easiest they wanna know what people IN GENERAL think an those answers are last wish and scourge, that‚Äôs objectively. Everything else is your own opinion and of course your good right to say, i just wanted to clear this up. Cheers mate.
---
I know how you feel and I respect, I‚Äôm not going to have a lot of time to play and I just tried to get things done (:
---
if you have enough of them you can craft a badge giving you emotes, backrounds, and xp
---
I personally swap between multiple pieces of arm and chest armors to sort of find best combo between all possible pieces. I know, I know. I'm doing big brain quick maths just for few seconds off of my cooldowns, it's what I do, ok?
---
It will still be a nasty gun since all they are taking away is the headshot multiplier
---
Don‚Äôt you dare leave that was a 10/10 pun
---
[I should introduce you to my friend who is of yeet as well ](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/d0exjj/a_god_amongst_men/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
Doesn‚Äôt Wishender have wall hacks every time you aim down sights, or is that different? I mean OEM is more passive, but baiting someone to shoot you is right up there with the ease of use of ADS, and Wishender shows all enemies that are close.
---
Thats fine. I've decided on that shaxx is my mans. At least you get useful things done running about doing  bounties and events- i just hang around the tower within shouting distance of shaxx and call it a day
---
I get what you mean. Ishtar stays up to date. There's also Destinypedia. MyNameisByf and Mylin Games covers lore pretty consistently and they summarize well.
---
There's a Destiny Lore app you can get on your phone (I have Android so not sure on iOS). It has most of the lore books from D2 (not been updated since shadowkeep) and grimoire cards from D1.
---
I would do curse of Osiris and red war then start all the newer content it will make it easier in the long run plus a lot of lore
---
&gt;i dont have a lot of exotics because im a new light player
---
That's not a very good excuse. I'm also new light, have 35/57 exotic weapons already and 20/26 hunter exotic armors. They force feed exotics to you. I haven't even equipped a lot of them to even try them out. 
---
That said, so what? Run whatever you want, have some fun. If you're running a high level nightfall, raid, comp or gambit, maybe try to run as effective of a loadout as you can so as to not handicap the team, but other than that? fuck it, enjoy yourself.
---
you will definitely crash their servers, please don't!
---
/s
---
Agreed but it won't feel like the best in slot weapon anymore. Due to needing to actually hit your crits, hand cannons is what I'll be switching back to for add clear.
---
Mecha sheeva! Mecha sheeva! Mecha sheeva!
---
&gt;This piece is going to my dad, who brought me into destiny and is my favorite titan of all time.
---
Enough to make a grown man cry :')
---
Seriously tho, It's an INCREDIBLE piece that's for sure! And it seems like you've drawn it on cardboard? That's really cool to me for some reason! So job well done my friend =D
---
I want it to be nerfed so fucking bad
---
Give me your Bungie.net ID so I can ban you for life
---
Well that's three fries short of a happy meal...
---
No one's talking about raid matchmaking because we don't need it
---
I got it only last season so i've had my fun with it, the nerf isn't too bad but it'll still be WAAAAAY up there in God tier energy weapons
---
As a hunter main, I give my respects for an awesome tether. Well done.
---
Excuse my ignorance but, what does "IP" mean in this context?
---
The nerf is live already???
---
I wear it whenever I play Sentinel. Completes the look I‚Äôm going for with my Titan.
---
so i should skip warmind then?
---
Red war -&gt; osiris -&gt; shadowkeep like this?
---
The thing about recluse being the only viable option for SMG is not true. Riskrunner is a great weapon especially PvE, and the SMG from Vex Invasion AND Eris morns SMG are actually GREAT!
---
Toned paper
---
No the nerf is tomorrow, it‚Äôs removing the precision damage modifier for non precision shots, basically you won‚Äôt do double damage on bodies any more.
---
Killmonger?
---
Well with all exotic engrams being turned into Fated engrams this season, and the change so that they will only drop armor after you have all the weapons, hopefully that aspect will go away now. That change is one of the best QoL changes we've seen in a while.
---
No, just going from what I know from it, I'd agree with you though, it's time for recluse Tobe taken down a notch so it's basically not ESSENTIAL for a load out
---
I was about to shit myself with how angry I was gonna be if that was all it did
---
they don‚Äôt even bring back old weapons with random rolls without a specific DLC for it and you think they‚Äôre gonna make cutscenes for weapon quests? lol
---
Does your friend play on pc
---
Curse of Osiris then warmind
---
Sixth coyote and wormhusk crown
---
Wait what‚Äôs the lore under?
---
Austringers, obtained from running The Menagerie, is my favorite right now. Better Devils is also very playable.
---
Pretty sure these classes are just to keep things coherent for gameplay because Light can be manipulated/wielded by any Risen who isn't really titled a "Hunter", "warlock" or "Titan"  
---
So technically all risen can create any "subclass" on the fly
---
Please record and post it for us
---
It appears from the trailer that there are different Saint-14s at different times in his life. I suspect we don't even take him from another timeline, we just kinda bump into him occasionally then go our separate ways.
---
Because 64 is a power of 2?
---
Exactly
---
Do you mean campaign(s) or /s?
---
If the first, your best bet is bounties.
---
Dammit. I don‚Äôt even know why was intrigued in the first place.
---
Check destiny item manager. Under progress
---
Edit. Sorry. That only shows up to 5. Maybe I should read.
---
Another one suffering from this
---
Invader on the field force feeding your primeval
---
You obviously don‚Äôt know what your talking about
---
Every time a quest line forces me to play crucible.
---
Breakneck was good, before rampage got nerfed.
---
Noted. Currently running sturm and drang (kinda shit but best handcannon i have rn + its exotic)
---
When you load into a crucible map, other than survival, there are 5 boxes below the crucible emblem.  They are shaded yellow for your current streak.
---
Other than that you could go to d2tracker or some other site and look at your games to see what your win streak is.
---
Whisper of the worm
---
I thought destroying taekos crystal summoned the thing
---
Wishender is actually underrated in crucible. 180+ headshot damage with wallhacks and crazy aim assist? Yes please.
---
Enough to make me want to stop playing the game
---
Every like 3rd raid with randoms...
---
Separate licences I believe so no
---
Theres only 5 boxes. That only shows if your streak is more 1-5. I'm trying to check how much higher it is
---
I thought it was the final crystal you destroy for the void charge
---
Idk
---
That step of malfeasance where you have to bank a fuck load of motes and if you die each mote you die with regressed the progress by two
---
THANK YOU! This was the exact kind of answer I was looking for. I think I may take advantage of the bundle that is on sale. It seems like bungie is finally able to thrive not being under activision now
---
Duplicated exotic engram drops, tbh.
---
Nope
---
Thank you for the gold, kind stranger!
---
Fugg
---
LateNightGaming has a video on this. Its a common theme for Bungie, and its actually better for FOV and taking in landscapes. Well, IMO I think its better. Some would argue otherwise.
---
His will is not his own lolü§£
---
Can't help because I'm at work but I will direct you to another subreddit that can.
---
r/fireteams
---
Crimson- random drop exotic
---
Austringer- Menagerie---Easiest to get/farm, just need runes and rune Menagerie.
---
Service Revolver-Vangard drop reward
---
Duke MK44- random drop
---
Midnight Coup- Leviathan Raid (Y1 weapon, so does not have the random rolls/perks, but still a good hc)
---
Spare Rations- Reckoning/Gambit Prime
---
Ikelos HC- Mars quest line for sleeper (also Y1 with static rolls, but good)
---
When I die to a super in crucible, then respawn and die to the same super.
---
Every single gambit game I‚Äôve ever played except for the first 3
---
She could of been like Ana or Cause just standing off to the side talking, as long as she was physically there talking it would of meant more than what she's become.
---
Those Scourge shoulders. Whoa! Imagine sitting behind those at a show!
---
Is this gun good?
---
I somehow nabbed one this weekend but haven‚Äôt used it yet.
---
Yum!  I need to make these
---
Could you provide video of this? Not arguing otherwise since I have almost never touched an AR I just have never seen/experienced this.
---
Then got o d2tracker or some other site and look.  The triumph and the emblem only show the highest streak or the total ranks depending on the item.
---
Mmmm, quality post...
---
Crimson
---
Midnight coup
---
When I‚Äôm LFGing a raid and I get kicked at the boss checkpoint so their friend can join
---
So basically it's just because hes mentioned in the backstory?  Sounds like hes a distraction from the fact that this update is completely lackluster
---
That‚Äôs such a cool drawing
---
I would go for an austringer from the menagerie. That shouldn‚Äôt take too long. Then if you like that, farm a spare rations from gambit prime/reckoning tier 2. 
---
I love my spare rations, but the farm for it can be long and tedious. Good luck Guardian!
---
Get the.medal cold fusion. Its 2 kills with a fusion rifle without reloading.
---
You actually can buy it today I believe, it's been a while since the beginning of the season, but I'm almost certain you have to physically choose to apply the season pass, it doesn't automatically apply it for you just because you bought it during a certain season.
---
Haha true
---
So that's worth buying an empty update?  A cutscene?
---
time to take over the sub
---
never mind we're going with that plan
---
Thanks, mate!
---
Playing pvp after two years hiatus and getting absolutely destroyed by todays meta lol
---
Always gets me, every time
---
Happy cake day bud
---
Soon it‚Äôll be *Chinese whistle* **GONG**
---
Serves them right for bunching up and camping the point.
---
OMG ME TOO, I thought I was the only one, I can‚Äôt seem to hit enemies with it.i always miss
---
Shut
---
What exactly is a "menagerie" is that like a certain strike? My knowledge for the game is pretty much strikes and crucibles, haven't even done a raid yet
---
oh okay, but its alright, I am just going to wait for tomorrow, I still have to farm a lot of levels so
---
Cayde-7
---
Save those
---
Good luck, Guardian!
---
*kills you*

u said destiny moment so.. 
---
playing 5 to 6 hours of kings fall hard mode and one is just like "nah" when we have to detonate
---
Up
---
Sure but this was a known concern with a previously clarified explanation - over a month ago.  It‚Äôs always easier to blame others vs procrastination tho.
---
Use a fusion and colony in momentum control, prob get a decent amount of medals relatively quick.  Hopefully learn a lesson for next season.
---
Per the livestream reveal, the new Season of Dawn artifact will have a single Anti-barrier "ranger" mod that covers pulse/scout/bows. Unstoppable mods will be available for either pulse, scout, or bows. The Overload mod shows an autorifle icon which may be the same from Season of Undying (covering AR and SMG).
---
iirc there is an exotic hunter (I think) armour piece that boosts sidearms.
---
Had no idea this was a thing. Found out yesterday. Also found out that accepting every quest is not the best idea cuz I don‚Äôt have much space for bounty‚Äôs üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
"Tw - one ticket for undressing mind"
---
I feel you bro, i would love to see a gamemode without invasions or less invasions. But very improbable to see that coming.
---
This. Is. AMAZING!
---
Yes, all the perks are changing and it is scout, bow and pulse focused.
---
Overload rounds will stay with auto rifles.
---
The cat got him. Not the Hangman
---
25 because it‚Äôs funnier than 24
---
Vog because it‚Äôs my fave
---
I saw something about that. I‚Äôll have to try it. What percentage does it give, do you know?
---
So you‚Äôre a small child or at an event for small children is what I get from this.  Make sure to get the crayons.
---
Praise the lawd!
---
You and me both. I don't have any of the crucible pinnacle weapons because it would involve me playing WAY more crucible than I could stomach. I only step foot in crucible for exotic quests. And before anyone asks, no I'm not bad, it's just not my thing.
---
Played warming for the first time, got the quest for sleeper stimulant, spent a week on Mars and was disappointed with it. It looks cool and the laser reminds me of a gun from borderlands. But I'd rather use man o war or arbalest
---
lol, Im glad this wasnt tagged with "Shitpost"!
---
same my friend called me a kindergartner and i called him a destiny boomer
---
I've seen 3% per medal
---
The only progress lost on any quest is if it says "in a single season" or "in \*\*\*\* Season".  Single season means it resets to zero, in X Season means it can only be done during that season.  Otherwise, progress continues across seasons.
---
Tips:  
---
Points are based on kills and motes deposited.....Guardians grant the most progress here....invade a lot.  If you are not good at invading use Jotunn, Truth, or any good tracking rocket launcher.  Playing in Prime also gives you more challenging enemies which will get you more points.
---
Medals--Easiest to get are first to block for sending the first blocker, submachinest for machine gun multi-kills, kill monger for 20 kills without dying, and not on my watch-for killing the invader when he lands.  If you have a full reckoning collector suit you can get medals for sending giant blockers also.
---
Ok, think of it like it‚Äôs own mini-strike. But at the end you choose which type of reward you want (sniper, hand cannon, etc)
---
Here is a YouTube video I used to go through the opening quests and stuff:

---
Absolute Madman
---
marked for vengeance x6
---
I‚Äôm so excited for the Solar and Void subclass emotes. Don‚Äôt care if those are silver only or if I can get them with Bright dust I‚Äôm spending everything I can to get those emotes.
---
There was a bit too much pressure doing the haunted forest. You can't die, you can't get lost. Sometimes one bad map roll and the run is ruined. I don't like to jump ship so knowing the team had no chance getting to branch 9 was frustrating.
---
That friend was me
---

---
Anddd... Crotas end
---
I understood last word is hard work on console because of the insane recoiling?
---
I mean I don‚Äôt live online and I work 80 hours a week and still managed to get everything done besides this. 
---
‚ÄúEasier to blame others‚Äù  ?????
---
I mean the subtext says kills and medals, I‚Äôve been getting kills and medals. No need to be condescending because you are a ‚Äúgod.‚Äù
---
Alright, alright, alright, let's see what we got.  Vex approaching!  Bring a steak knife!
---
Get double down with a fusion rifle and spend the night farming it, you have plenty of time to complete this step, you just need grind it like motherfucker.
---
Hooooooollllld them
---
Much appreciated. I‚Äôll try it out after dinner. Cheers.
---
And she's wearing lucky raspberry
---
69, last wish
---
No problem!
---
My preferred Gambit anti-Guardian weapon. Sadly, the catalyst grind is insane for it. Dozens or even scores of strikes, Crucible, and Gambit matches later and I'm at around 14%.
---
You say you wait to get pushed. So you're just getting flanked. Reposition often. Avoid using a sniper on smaller maps. 
---
Why is a shotgun not skilled? They got to you while you're using a sniper. Sound like you had plenty of time to adjust since they had to traverse the map to get to that range. Plus the counterplay is literally just moving. If you're having a lot of trouble with them, sit at neutral range with hand cannon or fusion rifle and punish them for pushing. 
---
They're not going to remove a whole weapon type from PvP. Just learn to play around them and counter them with gun type and distance
---
87
---
VoG is my guess
---
BTW, thanks for sharing your rewards!
---
Its the solstice gear i like the blue ornament best
---
As long as you own Forsaken, you can get Thorn. No exotic weapon has been made unavailable to obtain, and there is no indication the Thorn quest will go away at anytime.
---
Got it in one

Pay no mind to how low my score is...
---
Hey /u/dmg04, are you going to reply to the thread about the Solstice glows or just casually ignore it like usual?
---
That‚Äôs super lame
---
I don‚Äôt want to destroy your dream but didn‚Äôt crucible, gambit and vanguard bounties disappear from the previous season to this one? Could be cos we changed year tho.
---
Yes
---
Interesting!
---
I actually think this is live footage of every striker Titan in crucible.
---
Why care what hand cannon does the most work? You‚Äôre basically cheating with that mouse and keyboard so I think you‚Äôll do alright lol
---
Its doable but itll takes 13 survival wins which will take time and drop your rank progress for each loss. Your quest progress should transfer through the season at least the wins will. Nevertheless to get it done before season of dawn you'll have to grind survival nonstop with an organized fireteam of good pop players.

Bring back Cayde-6! Nothing you can do to me will hurt me more than it did to lose him.
---
Could do, but these days I usually run max discipline so a single proc of Benevolent Dawn is often enough to get me almost all of my grenade back. That way a single kill with Lumina is basically a grenade as long as an ally is nearby, so it feels a bit faster than Nez even at full stacks. Believe me when Voidwalker was my go to one of the first things I did was grind out Recluse, but as good as it is for ad clear...idk I'm not really a big fan. I even tried the double breach refractor build too. Probably because I tend to run out of ammo with it (still working on my mod collection).

You can switch to unranked if you've already hit fabled,

I can already hear the cascading level up sounds.

We already have that it‚Äôs called fracture I believe

Yeah I get it XD I‚Äôm a burning maul titan myself. I don‚Äôt even half to see you to kill you just blind fire a heavy attack, it‚Äôll do the work for me.
---
I just left farming right till the end of the season and this is the first roll I got. I cba to farm anymore and it's going tomorrow so jus wanted to know if it was any good.
---
Brother Vance
---
Mods?
---
Oof wish I saw this earlier.
---
Think that is a good roll. Wish I had that range MW
---
Please, brother.  We put this to rest, I literally had to bombard him in dm‚Äôs with bad jokes to make him leave me alone. - seriously, asides from blocking (which I don‚Äôt know how to do) the kid is straight up harassment.
---
Blue dots on the map. Look like blueberrys
---
oh ok
---
Hive on the field! Bring a sword
---
Why are the stories of all of the characters more interesting than our own?
---
Needs full bore, eye for an eye, and range masterwork, thats the god roll. I have one and its meh tbh. Rations pre ricochet rounds nerf was way better
---
and he doesn't afraid of anything?
---
cayde 6 good? zavala bad?

Hell yeah!!

Sick dude! :O

Hell naw

That was like half the grind too

Now we know for next time Guardian!

Better be some Gucci Zavala shirts or something
---
Bruh

Hunter alert wee woo wee woo stop grouping us with you
---
Use unstoppable rounds? They‚Äôre very easy
---
That‚Äôs why I said it‚Äôs my god roll. I have another one that‚Äôs meh. It has rampage but doesn‚Äôt feel as good as this roll.
---
This is it. This is our meme. Not this specific one, but we create these situations from what they say.

It is time.

I bet you‚Äôre fun at parties

Fantastic work !
