Not to mention the powe surge quest that's coming with the next season that gives you 690 gear.

---
You're not alone...happens to me all the time as well...if only Nothing Manacles were back, this wont be a problem...
---
I run sweet business sometimes because fuck the meta.
---
Groundhog day memes are the best memes.
---
Bitch bitch whaaaa!!!!!!!!!  It's too strong, they're too strong!!!  It's still too strong whaaaaa!!!
---
No one likes “reeee”.
---
Sad beeps
---
What about blowjob robots, can they make those? 
---

---
Blowbots, they could call them
---
Awesome thanks! Ill check out the guide you linked.
---
Oh, I'm on mobile so the mute/unmute button was in the way. I play Titan on PS4 and I was just going off the jump. Looks nothing like on console... Sorry for the mistake.
---
Fixed?
---
I know. I'm just saying that it's the fact that using a combo of 1 super and 2 weapons a challenging encounter can be completely trivialized. There's a difference between "power fantasy" and just being flat out over-powered.
---
It used to create large orbs of light per kill just based on how many allies are in the rift. If you had like 4 people in it for pvp, it would give everyone over half their super on a kill
---
obviously on PC from that field of view... would this have an affect on 1k voices? More frames equals more times the laser lands a fire explosion?
---
I know when u change languages in d2 it changes the voice languages as well, however some languages only have their UI, but the voice is still English (because they didn't do the voice-over), traditional Chinese is of them
---
Thank you so much!
---
Did you comment on some shit about tea bagging being too toxic but youre here defending this? Youre a special kind of snow flake aren't you?
---
Crap rave that’s what they are referring to
---
So there is not point to get it now and waste my time ?
---
It’s indeed super rare, but will appear. When I go mine I think I camped the area for close to three hours...want to say it was somewhere around 6pm PST when it finally spawned in. 
---
I would suggest loading in an putting a rubber band between your sticks so that you rotate and don’t get sent back to orbit. Grab a book or do some bills and listen for event starts....it will come, eventually.
---
It kinda looks like someone sliding in front of the intended target which could be a titan with Antaeus wards performing a return to sender. 
---
Or the game plus lag decided to give OP the finger.
---
You can see his surprise like “Wait I was supposed to die”
---
True. Maybe the Black armory forge or Raid Armor? They're the only armor sets I can think of that resemble Warmind/Siva aesthetic.
---
Forsaken exotics were just added to Xur's loot pool around two months ago. You still can't get things added after Forsaken from him.
---
Klaus is a sweat
---
Exactly ship is trash
---
Thx! I got the hang of it a bit actually, I use my Silicone, whatever sniper (the one from the nightfall) and then my Luna’s or recluse so yea lol it works thx tho!
---
With no DLC you’re kind of limited. You get some strikes and one raid and you can get to 300 light. I’d honestly suggest getting to that point and then deciding if you want to put a few more dollars in to get all the DLC up to that point. I feel the game is in a good state even with all the nerfs of some of the higher tier weapons.
---
Am I crazy this thing says on my screen attach a Detonator to in the enemy additional hits will cause the Detonator to explode it doesn't say anything about killing me and quite often I'll kill them and still see the Detonator attached to their dead body unexploded
---
In a roundabout way, It's named after Zheng Fei. The lion in the three kingdoms lion dance that represents Zheng Fei is called the "fighting lion". The item description of the fighting lion also references Zheng Fei.
---
Prospector immediately detonates on impact to enemies and you can’t detonate someone else’s grenades, from GLs or otherwise. Correct me if I’m wrong though.
---
Holy shit, the week I get forsaken has two actually good exotics lmao
---
I can attest that it does it based on character. Tried on my warlock, which had every armor piece, and got a dupe. (I didn't have all Titan/Hunter armor, so I should have gotten that)
---
The true dice roll is matchmaking.
---
The heavy is an issue, though.
---
Watch out for Rhabby_V
---
Welp time to delete crucible

Nice man

we felt like God Slayers in d1 (because we were) in this game we got stripped bare bones and are recovering crap left by others lol, not one weapon or armor piece has me feelin like that in this game. Don’t know how to explain it but uppercutting a dude in the face with raze lighter was so awesome... all swords do that in this game but it just feels...meh. the only time i feel truly powerful is when i nighthawk a boss and he gets insta’d. 
---
I felt like i had way more moments like this in d1 than in d2. Even with all the busted stuff that has come like the pre-nerf lens and 1k and sleeper and thunderlord. i don’t feel like a godslayer, the darkness can come in d3 and take all my stuff away again and i really wouldn’t care lol
---
We've gotten a few new Iconic armors and weapons. Of the top of my head I'd be sad about losing.
---
Weapons: Fighting Lion, Rat King, Polaris Lance, Tractor Cannon
---
Warlock: Chromatic Fire, Lunafactions,
---
Hunter: Wormhusk, Lucky Pants,
---
Titan: Synthoceps, Doomfangs,
---
And there's probably a ton more.
---
Oh god how did I forget. They're probably the worst of *all* of them. In both Gambit and The Whisper they're absolute cancer to go up against, it's awful
---
Besides 1k and Acrius they could scrap the rest. The armor in this is game is definitely the weakest part to me.
---
Right here [https://prnt.sc/nt4tp2](https://prnt.sc/nt4tp2) [https://prnt.sc/nt4tr4](https://prnt.sc/nt4tr4) Dont try that shit, bc. theres also a archive of your twitter. You aint getting out of it.
---
Would you happen to be aware of the hidden dialogue here?
---
RNG Flexes are some of the oddest flexes indeed.
---
I thought the same but when we went 4 prospectors it just didn't work, the grenades only detonated when i let go the trigger. By that time the boss had already teleported away
---
One of my favorite weapons to use in ZH is the Tempered Dynamo Arc Fusion rifle from Scourge.  I have one rolled with Disruption Break and Shield Disorient that destroys groups of arc shielded shanks with one shot from the right range.
---
Lmaooooooo, Mfin Bullseye
---
I like to remind them we got put on the same team because we are right around the same skill rating. I’ve I’m capable of having a bad game then they are are definitely capable of it too. Then I say I hope we’re on the same team again soon with a winky face at the end.  Kill em with kindness.
---
The Fallen’s Ether ain’t half bad of a snack, brother! You should try it sometime

what are the odds i meet someone with a Reddit cake day on my IRL cake day?! cheers to another year, friend!
---
got Anarchy on 2nd try
---
3rd got my a curated RL
---
[removed]
---
I never read a letter or comment from bungie on their own website and have only seen people on other media look at how the game works 
---
So I ask the community if they know second sources about why bungie decided to go for this obsolete method (it’s no fun running into trades in game modes/quests that punish you for trading kills/losing a fight because of it)
---
for the last boss you can switch to tractor cannon and have the warlock use nova bomb
---
D1 gets nothing
---
Just for the nostalgia even if they don't update d1 anymore
---
As a Titan main this really does take me home man
---
How did you kill the same guy so fast before he could respawn?
---
WARLOCK MASTER RACE
---
FIGHT FOREVERRRRRRR
---
I stopped playing destiny 2 a couple months before anthem was released. One of the major reasons why I stopped playing was because I couldn't get the damn dune Marchers leg piece! Dammit! They're so fucking cool and I couldn't get them even in D1 cause I kept missing it from Xur! 
---
Anyway, now that anthem has completely destroyed me and my internal reputation in video games, is it a good time to come back to D2? I've heard about some serious nerfs what happened there?
---
Pure luck. Its a random drop. You could get it from xur if he is selling it
---
They don't  feel the same in this game. At least to me.
---
I just came back lmao
---
What glitch?
---
Thanks, I’ll let my friend know
---
Can’t you get it from collections and transfer if you’ve already had it drop.
---
I have slideways and grave robber and the max range without using the perk that increases spread. I also use transversive steps to utilize the slideways bonus
---
Just take a break now. 
---
I won't skip Penumbra/season of opulence for sure lol.
---
I’ve been playing since the D1 Alpha, and yet to get one. I’m extremely jealous, congratulations
---
At the start I was thinking he’d just wasted more money buying forsaken and the legendary edition but he literally got even more fucked over
---
Uh, it's called the Two-Tailed Fox.
---
It's been in the game for months already.
---
Yeah? You think so? How about when the enemy team has four supers? Two of which are blade barrages? Or, how about doing the cheap thing and jumping off the ledge to avoid said super? Or better yet, have game awareness and realize that there’s an approaching super and not leave spawn.
---
these factors did exists, and when you fail to use any tool in front of you to adapt to a problem, you deserve the punishment.
---
No look at the picture
---
Their like small mini me rockets
---
youre talking only pvp right?
---
LOL same, for once my grenade seemed to have bent around the corners and kill someone other than me
---
Love it.
---
I definitely think hand cannons need to be changed on console, only specific ones are usable and not near to the extent they are on PC. On PC though, hand cannons pretty much define and dominate the meta. Why use a scout when you can use Ace or a 110? Why use an AR or SMG when 140’s and 150’s have the same effective range, and more? Why use any other primary when Luna’s/NF exist?
---
As for Erentil, I’m with you dude, you can reliably 1-shot someone from 35+ meters without much perk dedication. And stuff like backup plan just makes it that much worse to where you can be losing a gunfight, pull it out and 1-shot before the opponent even gets another shot off.
---
As for snipers, I genuinely don’t know why they were nerfed in Forsaken. Heavy snipers in year one were good, they had reasonable hitreg, they had decent but manageable flinch. Now, hitreg sucks, exacerbated by latency issues that just keep getting worse and worse with every patch, and you have to get the first shot off or get lucky, which basically means you have to be just better at the game than your enemy. And that’s just not feasible in high-end PvP, and shouldn’t happen at any point in comp if SBMM would work. Sure, snipers are great to pubstomp with no SBMM, but it’s not viable against similar-skilled opponents.
---
That somehow hurts to read but also extremely pleasing to know you got one as well!
---
Surroundings being teammates that round a corner and get us both killed by the Striker that was chasing me
---
You’ll get yours in due time, been playing since D1 beta and I’m just now getting one lol
---
Oh yeah, I should have specified, sorry.
---
In Pve then yeah, Sweet businesses is fun and effective!
---
Beta player here, I had the opportunity of a life time to score one in D1 but just as I was about to get the last guy he left lol
---
Can also use banner shield for same effect. Use both for MAX POWAAAAAA
---
I’ve been 1 off over a dozen times now, starting to think I’ll never get it. You’d think if I can get an “I made this for you” I’d be able to get a 7th column, but no.
---
That’s some laggy crap right there
---
I mean it’s called a change of opinion, I didn’t buy my account but what I liked as my helmet before I certainly don’t like now
---
So close.
---
I have this exact same roll with a range MW but I’m not the best with PVP. How are you with it? Has this roll been serving you well?
---
your first one ever? GO GET ANOTHER ONE GUARDIAN!
---
True. But the way the character looks in the creation interface is often not representative of how the model looks in the world. I’ve had to redo my toons multiple times because I liked how they looked on creation but was thoroughly unimpressed when I got to the farm and got to see them with “real world” light effects.
---
Godspeed and good luck u mad man!
---
I’m assuming you’re going for Fabled next season instead of grinding it this season? If so, the thing that helped me more than any loadout was when I played. I solo’d vast majority of my Fabled climb this season by playing around 7-8 am and 5-7 pm on weekdays, and mornings on Saturdays. You’ll run into less sweaties and try-hards around those times. Also, I always stopped after one loss to avoid tilt (I suffered from it really badly last season). This method will take you a few weeks but it’s viable for solo queuing as long as you play your life and make a good play or two every game.
---
All that said, as far as Titan loadouts go, I like bottom tree Striker with Eternal Warrior and Super mods everywhere; the neutral game isn’t the best but I’ve always felt Juggernaut with the Eternal Warrior was one of the best roaming Supers. For guns, it’s really dependent on what you’re comfortable with. Don’t be scared to use cheesy guns either like Wardcliff, Telesto, DRB, etc. 
---
Hope this helps, I’m sure others will chime in. Good luck Guardian!
---
I haven't got a Y2 exotic since D1
---
Mad cuz bad LuL
---
The how to have fun starter pack
---
We said fuck it, went to back to place of purchase, gave them bs story the code wouldn't work, and they surprisingly gave him a new game with no fight, just used the code and it all worked out.
---
this is the fucking Tractor Cannon
---
we will belive
---
I bag when I finally kill the guy who killed me a bunch, or when I kill someone who's targeting me specifically. Or when someone bags me.
---
Thank you
---
Yes. Tuesday reset to SoO
---
I’d have said Hard Light, but it still doesn’t play Darude-Sandstorm when the trigger is held.
---
Worthless.
---
Or he just jizzed in his pants. A possibility depending on the exotic.
---
I'm decent with a hunter ill give this a shot too thank you
---
Yup tried to do that when I had 4 but then I forgot this strategy and lost it all :(
---
I miss ecstasy.
---
This almost made me want to pick up the game again
---
and you get fucking hardlight
---
exotic engrams are so rare, that you'll probably collect all the exotics before your 5th drop since you started playing the game.
---
Yes, taking a break from the summer to play the new dlc
---
I got 4 shinubos vow or whatever 4 times in a row. I was pissed.
---
Hey am I banned from the sub? I tried posting a pic and it didn’t show up.
---
All 6 people use prospector. One melting point, a well with lunafaction boots, and a few celestial nighthawk.
---
I don't want them to use them, I want them to have them
---
Cluster bombs work exactly like they did before. Now, however, grenade launchers are a better option because they were buffed.
---
The game somehow tracks your activity level, so if you're playing on a daily basis it will be less likely that you'd get a drop, that's why it's always good to take a break.
---
I've tried it and it  works.
---

Thank you!
