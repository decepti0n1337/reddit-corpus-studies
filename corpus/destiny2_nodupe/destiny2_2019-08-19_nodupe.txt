I don‚Äôt think the game lets you do Dreaming city strikes until you unlock it. Same way that people who haven‚Äôt got curse of Osiris can never load into the Tree of Probabilities strike.
---
---
---
Depends on situation. JuJu for super regen when no flags available. If I need range I use a pulse rifle. If I want to do damage at medium to close range a HC.
---
I honestly can't wait to go for Legend in solo. I hate solo queuing because i always feel punished by bad teammates and ive never pushed past fabled in solo queue. I consider myself a pretty good Crucible player and tend to do well in Rumble, so Legend actually seems attainable now, which is crazy to me.
---
I want that as a wallpaper for my pc!!!
---
You have three classes and they've always been the same. Titan, Warlock and Hunter. üëç
---
Did you do it?
---
It should, otherwise why would it let me do the strike on playlist?
---
Better said, the designs of this ‚Äúartifacts‚Äù are shown in some clips, and this artifact... got McDonalded
---
Does it belong to a man who lives in a blue box?
---
My go to is Chattering Bone
---
I would say it will have some noticable changes, primarily the ability to pick and choose your armor mods to match your playstyle and look good doing it. The 750 boost will help you immediately get caught up and ready. Come back for Shadowkeep, its the perfect time.
---
Won‚Äôt work there‚Äôs multiple farms based on campaign progress
---
Whether i wanted it or not, i decided to level a warlock. So let's start by getting those power levels, one by one.
---
I mean the subclasses, blade barrage, novas warp ect
---
Or when they end up being 10x better than you and you drag them down
---
-30 points ahaha that's brilliant
---
Make shaxx appear on the side of the team getting stomped just before they get mercied to help out
---
Gotcha. üëç
---
Assists also add up to your score, without actually being relevant for the win.
---
Pray to RNGeesus.
---
which video is it?
---
It reflects every projectile and energy weapon while you slide.This applies to supers.
---
Put simply: it tracks actual kills as points, but awards player opponents defeated with an assist. Thats why your numbers add up to a higher total, but you lost. Hopefully that helps.
---
Assists count in the "opponents defeated" but not towards the match score.
---
What‚Äôs the top perk that‚Äôs selected? Never seen it.
---
It‚Äôs a random drop, you can‚Äôt just get it, but xur might sell it somewhere in the future.
---
My brother bought me overwatch so I could play with him. And man keyboard and mouse is great :D. So I'm getting some FPS gameplay in and one of the characters widow maker is like a sniper so I been practicing alot with that one.
---
I can‚Äôt wait for my friends to actually appreciate me again.
---
There's no best way. You can just hope that either Xur sells it or you get a random drop.
---
Ok but don‚Äôt go out here calling stuff OP or Broken if you don‚Äôt have all the info. That‚Äôs how we get unnecessary nerds in crucible. LoW pre fix? Broken. AoS on PC? Good, but not broken.
---
You missed xur selling them like 2 weeks ago :(

This is the only right answer.

I don't know, both are pretty rubbish to be honest. Definitely not the favourite child when compared to pve. Still, could be worse, could be adopted like gambit.
---
No problem man. I hope you find a shader that you love . Hopefully there will be some good shaders in shadowkeep. Best of luck guardian :)
---
Those are awesome dawg!
---
Cool creativity but gambit is a trash excuse of a gamemode.
---
Thanks for the Platinum. Most appreciated.
---
Unless it is reflecting your own bullets back into you
---
Meh, I would prefer my drop mag threat detector Rampage Range MW Night Watch...the only problem currently, is it takes like half a mag to kill something
---
Titans have adrenaline and testosterone as their primary sources of sustenance. If you‚Äôre distracted, you don‚Äôt have enough adrenaline

And you clearly aren‚Äôt a Titan if you can‚Äôt even recognize a quote from our lord and saviour, Shaxx.

---
Smh..

Specifically, top tree Striker.

It doesn't include forsaken or this year's season pass and only the delux comes with the pass because they are completely separate DLC so why would it. You don't need forsaken to play shadow keep though. The only thing that's free and grouped is all year 1 d2 content.
---
Ok thanks
---
I don‚Äôt play destiny two but I need friends so haha it‚Äôs so funny
---
You can't get scavenger on helmets unless that was sarcastic.  Super jealous btw.
---
Love the movie and the show
---
One punch man meets one shot man
---
Ugh. I didnt even think about that. Sad really really sad.
---
&gt;ok.
---
I don't kill the rider ever lol I just blast the bike to bits
---
Imo forsaken is one of if not the best dlc including d1. Dreaming City and Riven are fantastic I would say definitely worth it. However they are changing the way it works so iirc with forsaken you're buying access to Riven and the specific activities that came out since but like you can still go to dreaming City. Imo biased opinion I say buy it however you might want to wait for shadow keep and see what you can't do and if that's worth the price for you. It also might become cheaper at that point
---
Breakneck ftw. Pair it with actium rig and go to town in pve.
---
Truth lol. HACK! that vault
---
Hover over the subclass you're currently playing, go into details of it and you can spend the points to learn new grenades, jumps etc etc.
---
Try Braytech.com
---
It‚Äôs a nice one.
---
Pretty nice, thanks!
---
Yes, there are a variety of websites like this. On this subreddit, we usually pin the infographics made by [this guy](https://www.niris.tv/), but we can only have two pins at once, so we have the Director's Cut discussion post instead of the weekly reset infographic or Xur infographic.

I'm the one who'll feed him his Ghost tho and kill him with an opulent amount of food

I think it's better of if we just agreed that gambit was a mistake and moved on with our lives
---
2.5K keys so I figured I'd try and use em before they disappear. Not a fan of EAZ at all, but 4 exotics in less than 2 hours makes it worth it lol
---
Such a great gimmick in PvE, especially with bottom tree gunslinger: headshot insta-kill grants another knife. Shame it's so worthless in PvP
---
Battle of Twilight Gap actually. Vaporized at least one Kell, then faked her own death to research her own past life and track down Rasputin.
---
But gives you badass advantage.
---
The Last wish ghost also rolls with dc perks I believe, but other than that it‚Äôs just rng and pulling from collections.
---
Hunter jumps are way better and easier to use than Warlock imo
---
Hell yeah! When you‚Äôre caught up with Part 5, join us on r/shitpostcrusaders for the best Jojo memes
---
Dio was a hunter, confirmed
---
Interesting, I just find myself bouncing off platforms or over shooting platforms with the triple jump as there is no directional control.
---
Ah, ok. Still, you can't drop the ball when it comes to someone important like that
---
I'll take the hunter air-jump over the Titan skating float or the Warlock's miserable hover any day of the week.

I hope our guardian talking comes back in shadowkeep. I miss that.

What's the name? I need to be able to send the request myself due to user generated content blocker what's the discord server? I'm only available for a few days of the year for raids
---
If one had to go, get rid of prime but allow prime armor to work in class and add that loot table. Classic allows for more motes to be collected and if the game goes bad it allows a round 2.

Just more dead content the developers never addressed. Definitely looked like a huge worm god though.

Its a fun little gimmick.

i don't remember where but there was a piece of lore that said Ikora was such a master warlock that she could flip between all three trees at will and use them back to back.

---
You have to have Season of the Drifter which comes with the annual pass. The quest probably becomes available if you've got the annul pass, have played regular gambit and are at level 50.
---
Would be cool to actually venture into the Hellmouth (since I haven't played D1)
---
Nice
---
The one from the video might be a render or a 3D printed prototype and the other is a produced version. It might just be that they used the online version to "brief" the suppliers and the one they have now is the actual one they got and will deliver to everybody so they updated the site to reflect the delivered product.
---
Less of a bait and switch canvas bag style and more of a mass production limitation situation. 
---
I'm on mobile now, but I will try to link comparison pics once I get to a PC.

Wha-

Hope you get well soon

Thanks!

Thanks for that underline yo

What? I literally play like 20 different games, I don‚Äôt notice because there aren‚Äôt any issues.

Salute to you, fellow guardian. I dedicate my next crucible win to you. I wish you all the best!

For me it's vex and hive. Just gonna come out and say fuck the cabal and the taken lol. In my opinion of course.

I actually just got home from seeing John Wick.
---
Has absolutely nothing to do with Shadowkeep....same game doesn't equal to being the same or related. One is in a new area, one is on the moon, no story relationship, no enemy relationship, different everything, just happens to be in the same universe. The say you don't need forsaken for this so assume forsaken hasn't come out yet and you'll see that it wouldnt need to be there to be relevant...maybe i miss read the bundle to be you buy 1 DLC and get the other free, but I hope the bundle doesn't cost less that 1 DLC and a half, we need bungie to make money on these DLCs so they stop relying on Tess to make all their content, the more money you guys don't spend on DLCs the more effort they will put into Tess and selling us overpriced gun models...I don't want that, I really don't.

MOON HUNTED

A hunter get
---
Omg I love Lance Reddick do much. Zavala x Bosch crossover please
---
A lot has changed since the most recent beginners guides I‚Äôm aware of (see the sidebar) but they may still have some useful information. The absolute best thing you could do is find a clan to take you in and show you the ropes - although that might be hard if none of your friends play.
---
One of the things my friends had trouble with was understanding how the power progression system works, particularly the idea of ‚Äúpowerful rewards‚Äù. High power won‚Äôt mean much while you are playing through the base campaign, but it will be very important afterwards when you move to a more self-directed playstyle. A number of activities introduced in the forsaken season pass (the forges, the menagerie, to a lesser extent the reckoning) allow you to direct your power progression / upgrades, so if you are going to buy those expansions, it‚Äôs worth watching some videos on how they work.
---
For the immediate future, play through the campaign together and get reacquainted with how the game handles mechanically. Then maybe dip your toes into PVP, learn how perks and infusion function, learn about how to make public events heroic. Do the plot lines from the expansions if you picked them up. 
---
Then you‚Äôll want to think about what kind of gameplay you enjoy most (raiding, PVP, matchmade PVE, etc) and you can start learning about those activities and how to gear up for them. It will eventually start to make sense, I promise. Good luck!
---
Well, I looked at pictures and... perhaps you're right, I thought the shell looked more like Sagira!
---
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooof
---
Shits annoying though when you try to melee but it throws a knife
---
Eyes up Guardian.
---
The location to get the Niobe Labs has been there, but the Lab itself was not.
---
Good thing you underlined it, would not notice the point otherwise.
---
Not sure if you‚Äôre aware of this but I‚Äôm not esoterick and neither is 99% of this community. Most of here have never soloed a Nightfall.
---
I've always felt the d2 story could have been so much better if they just simply had our guardian talk back at everyone. No need to change the events or what happens. Just have our guardian talk for goodness sake. Throw some sass at ghaul, tell zavala we're fighting no matter the risk and tell ikora to snap out of it cause we all need her.
---
Drove me crazy that ghost just kept talking in our place.
---
10-15h seems low. Maybe I'm just not that efficient. 75 guardian kills might take me all by itself. Lol
---
Yep. Other such activities that require teamwork to finish faster would be things like, in the case of a Warlock, collect Solar orbs in Strikes and get Solar kills in the Crucible (across the fireteam)
---
This seems like a good strike to do it with. I‚Äôll wait and see what comes up in tomorrow‚Äôs reset.
---
Because they‚Äôre balanced by their charge time.
---
Restart the game/console
---
LFG is just awful for this. I don‚Äôt get why people join up. I‚Äôve had people join for Inverted Spire, clear the adds at the beginning public section and then leave after the Vex Milk Waterfall section right before scoring actually begins! What is the point?
---
Just go and kill one enemy anywhere, what's the drama?
---
if i dont have the game on ps4 anymore but wish to cross save transfer to PC will this still work?
---
Looks like a heavy fusion rifle that shoots a single hyper beam.
---
How can this task even be completed last? You literally have to focus on avoiding these orbs. No matter what I do, this task is completed among the first ones.  
---
Just in case you or someone else does not read the requirements attentively: you have to pick up the orbs with a matching subclass, e.g. picking void orbs with void subclass. Picking arc or solar orbs with void subclass won't count.
---
Oh god !

Chain of command, McNulty.

It seemed bad at first but it turned out to not really be that bad of a grind, nowhere near 75 hours, even for 3 characters.
---
Mmm beautiful gun.

I didn't know he was Zavala's voice or had anything to do with the game, and I just woke up with a terrible hangover to see Lt. Daniels playing Destiny. I think I'm going back to bed
---
Well titans bash both of us with bare fists, a shield and a hammer. You don't say anything to them. But yeah it gets confusing like I try to tempest strike but end up throwing knives.
---
Should have been 100 enemy combatant kills in crucible or Gambit. Objectives requiring presence but not participation are a curse.
---
I've hit crits with the knife before, too bad they don't one shot

If you aren‚Äôt attached to doing it solo, but would want to clear it, I‚Äôm totally happy to two man it with you! I‚Äôve run it dozens of times, and it‚Äôs my favourite content currently in the game. Alternatively, I‚Äôm happy to pass on my tips for solo, and solo flawless, as i‚Äôve completed both. If you‚Äôre on PC, feel free to add me, Radiant#11449

Yeah and pick arcstrider. He seems to be fond of bowstaffs

Holy shit, I've never heard that. That's amazing

Yep the state pf gambit at the moment, I'd suggest looking into LFG's on discord for any type of multiplayer activity!

No, because that's exactly how holt would say it.

There are five weekly bosses on a rotation and you have a chance to get the sniper from three of them (boss defeat drop).  You don‚Äôt get it from sleeper nodes or the chest and I don‚Äôt know a ‚Äòcheat‚Äô way.

Dlc comes out in October. Should be a post about this type of thing stickied if you want to get into it. Base game and the first 2 dlcs will be f2p along with all other patrol content free for dlc you don‚Äôt own. Up to you in what you want but a lot of changes will come in October, especially to the sandbox. Don‚Äôt want to like something and then have it change drastically.

Don't mean to hijack but I'm pretty sure you need to have the quest step to get it. You can check it in pursuits.

I can‚Äôt think of any good reason as to why they would do this.

Not sure what platform you are on but there is a complete forsaken edition. I believe it‚Äôs $40 on all platforms for all existing content available, which is base game, the first 2 dlcs, forsaken expansion, and its annual pass, plus some neat little extras

Honestly, after making 2 new characters to get the solstice armours. The thing I need to get used to is the different jumps. I had been only playing titan before. I can't tell you the amount of times I've accidentally killed myself by jumping off a ledge expecting my next jump to lift me up but it ends up gliding instead.

Nope it‚Äôs only one account chosen for crossplay

Awesome - thank you!

I once had a guy in the Nokris strike throw the ball at Nokris himself instead of the crystal at the boss fight. He was a Wayfarer too...
---
Great tips! Thank you! Why do say the crucible kills will be easy? That part looks the most intimidating to me. I have been super successful in there...
---
~~lucky~~ gud
---
The full text is wrong. It doesn't have to be on guardians. Just get arc super kills, use top tree arc and teleport around killing a bunch of enemies while doing the other tasks. If you have just that left, I recommend going to Last Wish and using the wish to go straight to the Shuro Chi encounter and then just get super kills on the thrawl that spawn at the beginning.
---
nah, he would just teleport to a standing position
---
Ok, I think I will do that. I don‚Äôt mind wasting time because I‚Äôll have fun doing it. And I really like destiny so it won‚Äôt feel like time is getting wasted. Thank you :)
---
Cuz you're bad at it. If you were half decent you'd see the skill involved in it

It is 500 to finish the Hope quest. The hope quest line leads to the Not Forgotten Hand Cannon.

---
Destiny 2 New Light is Destiny's new F2P model. It seems like you'll get everything except Forsaken onward. They're removing Levels and focusing on Light Level and getting you into the game as fast as possible. I'd look it up if I were you.
---
Do I need to finish all green pieces before I can upgrade?
---
Yes this was addressed in the very first shadowkeep ‚Äúgameplay‚Äù trailer. There was a guardian holding one in that old trailer as well
---
You can choose the individual strikes on their corresponding destinations. But the strike playlist randomly gives you one every time
---
Playlist is random, go on planets maps to select them
---
I m excited
---
Yeees another auto rifle
---
For nightfall it rotates every weekly reset through 3 of them. So next week there will be 3 new nightfalls to choose from
---
Gonna hop on Stadia to get my crucible pinnacles from now on
---
If you are entering the vanguard strike playlist, you have no control over which you will get.
---
You can only selecte a strike if it is either a nightfall or directly chosen from a destination.
---
Are you asking specifically about Nightfall? Because nightfall is a random selection off three strikes each week
---
You could probably kill the Titan from this angle, if you didn't die to the snipers in under a second later.
---
The nightfalls work differently than strikes. The 3 nightfalls are randomly chosen by Bungie each week. The strikes playlist is completely random, but you can do any specific strike you want by going to the destination (on the map) it is located on.
---
i try :)
---
Sorry bad quality. I just can't do any better on mobile right now. If someone gets a better screenshot I'll delete this.
---
i hope it s hunter season
---
there will be pinnacle activities that allow people to get above 950. 
---
i think the intent is for these activities to not be feasible for very casual players
---
Any clue what the perk of this Helm is?
---
Oh ok! Sure I‚Äôll look it up on YouTube rn. That sounds awesome!
---
Yes you have to complete all 5 pieces of gear before going to blue, then the same to majestic
---
I felt this when I looked at it, I saw the pop up and knew what to do instantly, my friend who has done raids upon raids and has done the strike many times didn't even know.
---
May I point out that the season symbol isn‚Äôt the one for shadowless like the others but looks more like the head of a Vex goblin? Maybe a vex themed event?
---
That's what happened to my friend he got me into d2 and then I got 1k before him

" According to Smith, some of the biggest frustrations for Destiny players come when they‚Äôre too under-leveled to play with their friends. To circumvent this, all loot ‚Äî including what players already have in their inventories ‚Äî will jump to the current cap of 750 with *Shadowkeep*‚Äôs release. In the free-to-play New Light, players will all start at 750 Power. "

paracausal phenomena that defies the know laws of physics. It‚Äôs what makes Guardians do weird space magic
---
Now I can't not read that in his voice haha
---
‚ÄúMy Ancestors are smiling at me imperial, can you say the same!?‚Äù
---
I read it in Christian DeVille's voice actually
---
Ok minecraft has on average 87 million to 94 million players a month, lol has 100mil is players
---
or make it optional and give a 2nd option to not do it and do some grindy shit in pve so the people like me who despise everything pvp in d2 so we dont drag down those who want to play normally by making the grind as enjoyable for us.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I didnt do the afk shit but i told my team everygame im only going to be shooting shit and nothing else
---
Gotcha, thanks!
---
Makes sense that Zavala wouldn‚Äôt leave that strike
---
I'm very upset that whoever made this didn't go with Quaxx.
---
I can continue. Skyrim has more players than destiny? Battlefield 4 has more players than destiny
---
Oh man, shots fired
---
Suddenly very thirsty fot a glass of Vex milk..
---
This is the most Titan thing I have ever seen
---
That's a great idea!
---
The cloaks make it all worthwhile
---
I picked Hunter but I play every game like it's Devil May Cry, so I  just go straight to the fight. So pewpew, O&gt;O (reload), back to pewpew
---
It's pointless. Way quicker for everybody to throw a ball.
---
Don't do that, you will most likely not make it in time and in Shadowkeep, you will get plenty of new shiny stuff that will effectively amount to the same, because ... you know ... they have to give something to the new and the old ones. Your call, though.
---
I tried to play Destiny again after not playing for a year. I had a horrible experience and will never pick it up again. I used to be really into PvP in Destiny, so u tried about 5 matches. The first match was a full stacked team that just wiped my team like it was their job, the second match it was a losing game that was already in progress when I spawned in, the third match was actually decent, and the last 2 were against more full stacked teams. The matchmaking sucks in this game. There's no way a guy that hasn't played for a year should be dropped into bullshi like this. I was still figuring out the controls again and they drop me into the same matchmaking that I was in a year ago and played the game daily. I'm going back to GTA and will never pick up Destiny again...
---
Hahahaha have you looked at skyrim nu.bers or any of these games actual numbers lmao
---
You are the bullet
---
Please keep going lmfao it's hilarious
---
We shall cry together fellow guardian
---
The games you named you sound like  13 year old kid
---
Just follow the daily and weekly quests for a while, until you are comfortable. Oh, and follow the Forsaken story-line, because you want those juicy new classes that get unlocked. Some of them are awesome.
---
Oh bless your heart, you tried.
---
r/woooosh
---
I'm on Xbox sadly!
---
Holy crap you flipping killed them dude!
---
r/woooosh for y'all
---
Yeah idk what everyone is complaining about, gambit prime has always been stomp or get stomped, fast games, took me WAYYYY longer to do 100 minibosses on each character than 30 gambit matches, and then ofc they go and make it easier to coddle all the scrubs
---
Has happened to me a couple of times with some random weapons I've had
---
I have the same problem bro... i have so much lag only on destiny 2, in game like league of legends, overwatch, pubg.. etc i have good ping or ms.. i don't know why, maybe because destiny online  is P2P?
---
It‚Äôs da best!!! ü§£
---
Dang bro, just keep persistent, you‚Äôre day is coming for sure!
---
This just makes me jealous of that juju... gotta slowgrind some bounties cause that shit is Esspensive
---
He protecc 
---
He attac
---
But most importantly,
---
He just wanted to get a snacc
---
I believe so yea, but I would look more into it in case there‚Äôs more requirements.
---
The irony in that comment. What are you going on about?
---
I don‚Äôt understand how people can say destiny is a dead game? The amount of players has stayed pretty consistent, and Bungie is constantly adding new features and updates
---
Only while your subbed. It's like PS Plus etc. Once you cancel you lose access til you sub again.
---

Also, finishers and the seasonal artifact. Which both look lile awesome additions to the game.
---
Over 600 hours and never noticed the text.
---
I only had to do the protocol 2 times for the SMG and if I just dedicate a day to doing it with the help of D2 companion fireteams I should be ok. Though I know it may not be so easy, it‚Äôs always nice to have positive expectations.
---
That strike is so long unless you kill that chick in the first room.
---
Y‚Äôall give me hope that there is still good on this Earth
---
Yup why I back out when it comes up
---
Thanks! I was using [this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.shacknews.com/article/109181/escalation-protocol-schedule-destiny-2%3famphtml=1) as a reference but then again, I should‚Äôve known it‚Äôs been changed at least once.
---
TIL this can be done
---
For the love of holy Shaxx spend your damn glimmer
---
WHAT!? Since when do we kick people and not punch them as Titans lol
---
No. If you Cross save over your PS4 characters to PC they will use your already purchased content that you have on PC.
---
" well fuck"
---
can i has a fireteam pwease i havent ever done it.
---
Dude honestly, getting through forsaken can be done in a weekend, its a pain in an alt but its worth it just to have the access. Also if you pop in to the blind well on a saturday or sunday there's generally people running it
---
Bruh
---
If u do it in comp, I finished it early this season in a day - 2 days of half ass grinding. Militias that I rarely used, fighting lion for calculated trajectory, and then swapped to colony for double kills after.
---
Alright, thanks mate!
---
Awesome, thanks a lot :)
---
FTW!
---
You probably set a really high power handicap, which basically lowers your power by however much you set it to. If you set the handicap high enough, you will be too low power to do damage.
---
I like the sudden looks side to side like, "what the hell? Did I just do that?" And then immediate teabagging
---
You can still do it, doing it isn't winning
---
I can imagine a titans foot curling up into fist mid kick
---
Lol sounds like your weekends are a blast. Guess the post should have been to the "scrubs" that have a life
---
Also, if you haven't done nightfalls before, I would suggest doing it with a group.
---
He is joking
---
Can I ask what gaming chair u use to get this insane luc-  skill üòÇ
---
*sees shadowy corpses*
---
Nope.
---
*shadowy corpses fglow red and are coming after me*
---
NONONONONONONONO
---
Some people don‚Äôt joke like he does though, and they will legitimately call you trash over your class choice
---
I got the same bug, it put you into a "quickplay" breakthrough match (worth valor)
---
I was a hunter from D1 to D2 and they were good then got meh and I wasn't talented enough to play them, so I switched to Titan for Forsaken, got some of that glory but then it to became meh, now I will main a warlock!
---
4 years... of destiny 2?
---
I mean one of their d1 dlc was code named cabal carnival soooo
---
This is an automated message to inform you that the Bungie Exotic Kinetic Hand Cannon Crawler has mined your data.
---
The data has been delivered to The Automated Procedure For The Creation of Exotic Kinetic Hand Cannon Quests.
---
Preliminary ETA for release of finished game code: October 1st.
---
it‚Äôs a titan so.......
---
dont see why it wouldn't be, but i have no idea
---
Bold move getting it on the hand. Always wanted a hand tattoo
---
I'll tell you right now,  it hurts like a bitch
---
I have counterbalance stock on Recluse(console), should I use major spec?
---
Log into bungie.net you should still see your characters.
---
Have you ever seen a blade barrage
---
On your hand? With that shaky line work? 
---
....not my favorite, but if you like it then good enough i guess.
---
Says the man that pussyfoots his way around videos and the content he‚Äôs trying to cover to push out that 10 minutes for ads. Fuck outta Kackis üòÇüòÇ
---
Man, I have enough trouble hitting hive wizards with a launcher when they‚Äôre 10 feet away. Damn you.
---
oh my lord lmao
---
Just because our every thing is worse than the other 2 classes doesn‚Äôt mean we suck
---
THEN YOU NEED PEREGRINE GREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAVES!
---
Can‚Äôt be haunted if you are the terror.
---
Mean the discount Nova bomb?
---
yep its there. So it shouldn't be a problem transferring to PC?
---
It's sad becuase it had the budget and the actors to be really good, hell, it probably had the passion too. But the editing and script or something just made it fall super flat. It just felt kinda soulless too. Almost every other marvel movie has some kind of moral or message that can speak to the audience but...
---
I both love and hate this idea.
---
Stab and bag.
---
*chuckles in return of weapons of light*
---
Nope, just link the account you are going to use and when cross save is announced make sure to pick your ps4 account as your active cross save account.
---
That shaky line work is called sketchwork, stylistically goes against the clean and organized style of traditional tattoos, and with it being on the hand it's going to warp fairly easy.
---
I don‚Äôt get how Bungie allows shit like this to happen after 5 years.
---
I‚Äôm planning on getting Hive runes on my arm in the future. Things like this keep convincing me to do so.
---
I'm PC exclusive so I can't really comment on controller usage. Sorry mate.
---
I can‚Äôt argue with this.... they do look like putters.
---
they're all watching the level 19 through their scopes to make sure he gets the kill
---
And they throw that shadow ball thing every second. 
---
It‚Äôs worth sending a medium blocker in gambit over a large sometimes.
---
That is sick
---
I like it besides it being the hunter emblem
---
Go for it! Be proud of these things! My artist is still working on a Riven piece for my upper arm.
---
Get fucked! Oh fuck they dodged away again
---
No this is Patrick!
---
Ba-dum-tshhh
---
Imagine spending $300 and playing titan lol
---
