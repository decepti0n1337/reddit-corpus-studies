Can I just have serious replies.

May I have a copy as well? Got some good ideas for this bad boy

Yep. It‚Äôs a shame that I like the short blue ornament better.
---
You also got to realize that this poster also posted a post called ‚ÄúCoO is better than Black Armory.‚Äù
---
No, this isnt a serious subject.  I save that for shit that matters. Lighten up dude, lifes too short to be so uptight

Oh sorry, missread

True. But I kinda want meaningful arguments.

I think you may be right

I saw one aswell today and It was also on IO XD. It was a blue mini.
---
These things are great, if you do a jump and use your down arrow on PC you literally t pose mid air
---
Doe the ornament actually make a difference?
---
I haven‚Äôt tested it on polaris lance, but the ornament makes a noticeable difference on Chaperone so it would stand to reason it would work on Polaris Lance
---
Sorry, my bad, I love put those things everywhere

If you‚Äôre abducted by the person driving this vehicle does it make you taken?

It's called git gud üòÇ it does give you extra if you also have 5 super mods on. Like I said in my prior comment. Also reloading for you + damage buff is more than most other exotics offer

The Menagerie is too spoopy fro guardians
---
Yeah that happens if you don‚Äôt place the souls in time. Caught me way off guard my first run
---
The worst part of it is propably the waiting. But just same grinding will do the trick. Right now, I just need to finish the armour set of solstice and then I got the seal. Good Luck.
---
I would kill for a non super mode. The opposite of mayhem mode honestly
---
Nope. Nope. Nope
---
Definitely caught me off guard. Thanks for the info!

Ah ok im new here thanks
---
I don't know. I wasn't able to access the Tower today without spending $39.99 on the Annual Pass and Forsaken bundle, now available on Battle.Net buy today.
---
Titans are Cleary the dominant PvP class. With levels of godliness hunters, especially, could never hope to reach.
---
I'd rather play 50 gambit matches than play 10 strikes. The snore-fest ughhhh
---
Same here and with all the possible ways to customize your armor with certain textures, was gonna be a nightmare for me since I've amassed tons of fashion frame in warframe.
---
Garbage mode. 
---
People are forced to play to keep up with game and friends. 
---
The more bungie forces people into modes they hate, the deeper the hate becomes. 
---
The mode just doesnt work. Too much favor added to teams to be fair for solos. 
---
If they changed that aspect of matchmaking and slowed down invasions, and got rid of catch-up mechanics. 
---
I think people would be ok with it.
---
I don't know if you know this, but everyone had a problem with Spectral Blades except for the people who used it, people will tell you it's because there's mostly Hunters in crucible but even a lot of the hunters were sick of it
---
Confused me the first time it happened. I just finished interacting with a raid banner when I suddenly died. I assumed it was somehow the banner.
---
Wasn't until my next death that I realized it wasn't the banner, but that I accidentally stepped on a soul prior.
---
Just do what you find fun and don't play without eachother
---
Did you notice it‚Äôs one of the Dreaming City towers upside-down.
---
Allowing losing matches encourages AFKers and that is one of the biggest problems about this game along with quitters. They made sure people couldn‚Äôt AFK the EAZ with having to actually damage the mini bosses but didn‚Äôt protect it from quitters.
---
Dunno your armor perk situation, but prometheus if you have auto rifle and Special Ammo perks, and sunshot if you don't I guess. I think there's a Titan exotic chest that Auto-loads auto rifles.
---
Fuck off you scumbag
---
Don‚Äôt do that, don‚Äôt give me hope...
---
 *uldren noises*
---
Np man
---
well i've been playing more or less since d1 launched, but armor 2.0 does require you to level up armor so i wasn't sure if it would be like this or some other method (i know solstice is  extra grindy)
---
Now that is epic

I played a match today with dunemarchers and omfg I dont know if I can go back to oem. I love zooming across the field to blast away some poor fool with lord of wolves
---
I used the second encounter in the last wish and got it done in 5 runs.
---
Is it true that the only way to obtain the glows is through eververse?
---
I dont think arbalest counts as a annual pass exotic, cause it was revelry first which was free to all players
---
Indeed! I'm glad to see someones on the same page. :) Cheers mate
---
Hammers have travel time. If someone just jumps around and I‚Äôm far away I‚Äôm gonna waste like 3 hammers trying to kill you. Clearly you don‚Äôt have a lot of hammer experience
---
üòÇ Well SORRY, you fucking Uber nerd,  take the stick out of your ass and calm down maybe? Your Reddit creditability and ego are at risk OH NO üòÇüòÇ
---
I was more talking about the solstice armour but that was also helpful, thank you
---
It's happening to all of us. If not than it's happening to me as well
---
Yes it basically doubles the range, it‚Äôs so stupid.
---
It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs harder to track hunters on console. If a hunter just jumps over me I‚Äôm fucking dead because I have no clue where he is
---
I got destiny 2 for five bucks

Yeah a mate of mine told me that not 1 hour ago. I didn‚Äôt realise that was a big issue on console until now. But on PC that‚Äôs not a big deal.

Lmao that‚Äôs nothing. Remember when we had to do 40 gambit matches for breakneck?? Yeah that broke my neck
---
There is no difference in Masterworking Solstice Armor to any other Armor Piece so I though you didn't know what Masterworking does to your armor in general
---
I just thought since on the ps store it literally said I would get it upon purchase that I would in turn get it upon purchase
---
Yup
---
Which is weird because my last run through Gambit had people playing and half the matches were people playing but not making much of an effort to do anything or just doing the usual shit of get heavy ammo but not to use for invasions when the portal is open or about to open.
---
Thankyou, i was confused because i bought the engram from xur and didn't get arbalest (I got a dupe armour) so i thought it was locked out of my loot pool

[This is a very commonly asked question](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/search?q=buy+forsaken&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on). The short answer: year 1 content is going free to play in September.

If you can‚Äôt get it in 3 months idk what to say to you...
---
I got mine in 3-4 hours, 0 to 2100, only one loss along the way lol
---
What's everyone's problem with gambit? It's, besides raiding, my favorite part of the game
---
I‚Äôm poooooooooop man whole dooky
---
Xur's engram can't give the newest exotics.
---
It's called ranked for a reason. If you can't manage even a 50% win rate, you don't deserve a gun earned from RANKED play.
---
Okay good because I was gonna say if Last Word is in d tier than I must be the insane one
---
I'd argue that Melting point is more flexible as it can be applied without prep/trash. Shattering Strike doesn't have a CD but its limited by requiring the proc to be up which can be messed up a lot. Also Hammers can be used from ranged and is a lot more reliable since Spectral Blades loves to constantly miss and travel through the target wasting large portions of the super. Overall both of these specs could use some love in PVE.
---
Good stuff dude
---
Synthoceps are my favorite. Fuck OEM, those bad boys are my crutch.
---
What is melting point?
---
Nice repost gamer.
---
Honestly I love Gambit but hate it when it‚Äôs a quest requirement because it brings AFKers into the mode. At least with Crucible steps you can do Rumble to not have to deal with AFKers dragging you down.
---
What's fun however is afk farming a lot of key fragments and opening a ton of boxes for different rolls for the majestic gear. Just got Heavy Ammo Finder on the helmet and gauntlets, just need the hood.
---
Anarchy, SOTP raid exotic
---
That'd be really really stupid. It's why Valor exists. You don't lose Valor.
---
Glory is earned and lost as its a ranking system. You'll still climb with a 50% win rate.
---
If you can't manage that, don't expect the weapons from RANKED play handed to you.
---
Practice and get better.
---
Never been a more disappointment developer than Bioware. Created a true masterpiece in the Mass Effect trilogy followed by a crappy new ME game and this turd. Just follow the same damn formula that was already proven but with a new story. Is it that hard?
---
Oh my god I‚Äôm stupid that‚Äôs for the help dude!
---
Poor frames..thank you for the correction lol!
---
&gt;And my titan is generally a good boi who Melting Points the boss and kills ads when needed.
---
Destiny 2 is a pretty cool guy, eh Melting Points the boss and doesn't afraid of anything.
---
It's not worth it  i can wait until next year when they finally get rid of pvp Allo together to allow for much more diverse and fun pve
---
Melting point (aka Hammer Strike) is a debuff that top tree Sunbreakers can apply via sprinting melee.  The target affected by Melting Point takes 50% more damage from all sources for about six seconds.
---
It‚Äôs tragic! I love checking out his table and all the collectibles he has though
---
depends on whether you want to hang back and shoot or rush in like a madman guns blazing.
---
Can other subclasses aply this same debuff?
---
Or something very like it?
---
You're not forced to play comp. You don't HAVE to have crucible weapons. You WANT the crucible weapons. Very big difference.
---
Lol true. I‚Äôve located a decent amount of the scannable items and some hidden rooms but didn‚Äôt know about the ship. 
---
Ultimately though, exactly lol.
---
I‚Äôm not blaming you for that. I‚Äôm just saying you should take the loss because it‚Äôs really not worth complaining about two shaders you can‚Äôt get because you didn‚Äôt play y1. And also if bungie just gave out/only sold shaders from the past, what would people do if they already have those shaders? And those two shaders definitely aren‚Äôt the ONLY good looking ones. What about raid shaders, crucible shaders, IB shaders, gambit shaders? You have access to those right? Begusian night is one of my personal favorites and you get it from forges. Just look at what you have instead of complaining about what you don‚Äôt.
---
So it‚Äôs the same fist slam just single target? (I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm such a noob for these questions)
---
It really is. But at the same time I usually go in with at least a duo and melt the prime stupid fast with just us two.
---
at least dregs spawn frequently, collect from 7 vandals sucks the most
---
As someone always chasing the biggest light since day 1; I‚Äôm always overjoyed when people keep fighting to get there. No matter how lot the cap has been out.
---
Thank you for this!!
---
No problem, guardian!
---
The worst is the cabal bosses that do that knock back attack and boop you off the map then it spawns you somewhere completely random. Yeah I know the feel. It‚Äôs ‚Äúcontent‚Äù designed to keep you busy.
---
It's pretty easy to play around. Just burn through the first dps phase, then clear the first 2 envoys, wait for their invade. Once they're gone clear the last envoy, dps and kill the boss with 2 stacks.
---
The 200 super kills is glitched. It says guardians but counts everything.
---
Even back in D1 I always thought a more Halo style of radar would improve pvp. Being able to tell exactly where someone is when they are near you would help with the crazy CQB moments when you just can't find where someone is despite them being close enough to breath on you. It would also help with those moments where you peak a corner and eat 3 sniper rounds to the chest when you thought only one person was there.
---
Not sure what you're on about. A 50% win rate pretty much means minimal to no progress.
---
Hehe, nice.
---
I'm really confused, have you used some of these weapons?
---
I remember back when people still used Scout Rifles.
---
What did thunderlord do to you! To be set by that joke of a gun jade rabbit! My heart can not take it!
---
Middle tree Void on the Hunter can apply a similar debuff with a melee that also applies 50% damage increase to the target. The hunter must get a crouching precision kill before they can apply the debuff to a target.
---
MUDA
---
You still gain progress. If you win and lose back to back, you WILL gain progress, albeit slowly.
---
If you manage to get winstreaks going you'll gain even more, as loss streaks aren't a thing.
---
That's why 50% is a pretty basic level to reach. If you can't manage even that, you don't deserve crucible weaponry.
---
I'm not saying it's okay, I'm saying it doesn't matter. Facebook uses more of your data than the Epic store could. If you use Google or any social media you will find ads catered to your recent searches. It's not being stopped by any Government so that's the world we live in .
---
If you don't like Epic, blame Steam also. They take a large chunk of profit were developers feel that they could do better on the Epic store.  The Epic store has also given me around half a dozen free games now, which I can't hate on at all. 
---
Metacritic has user reviews and professional reviews. They arent mixed in and have two distinct sections. 
---
Steam is 100% user based. Which is not always a good thing. Some users like to play the "I don't like what the Devs stand for and am going to give it a bad review". If people really want to do some reviews on a game it's simple. You don't need steam to tell you only..
---
Bows are not good for dps, I recommend at least finishing one set of armour as you are just getting into the game and can passively finish most of it and get some decent gear along the way, most exotic quests have pvp components but a few don‚Äôt. Fortunately there are plenty of exotics that randomly drop or with easy crucible portions
---
 Bows,scouts and auto rifles are really bad right now. Mainly hand cannons, shotguns and pulse rifles dominate in the game right now. And a lot of exotic quests are pretty easy to do solo. And a lot of exotics are rng drops.
---
I can't do it again, but yeah, in a nutshell
---
Would‚Äôve been awesome, wasn‚Äôt to much of a missed opportunity they could always do it again
---
They are the best for finding chests!  Especially when paired with the rust punk shell.

---
Woahhhhhhh, good one man! üòÇ
---
There was never really. A boss dps occasion to where it would use more than the shots already given. So. It‚Äôs still really good. Just people found other weapons that do better.
---
Damn, wish I could give you more luck but I amat an all time low of luck.
---
This happens all the time in gambit.... and then the invader snipes you .
---
The EAZ minibosses are the most time consuming one
---
You can only get the truth from the ogre boss in menagerie and the outbreak is really wierd. Some people needed rat king quest done and some didn‚Äôt
---
Nah, I was running through all the other objectives first. Figured thatd take the longest
---
Yep. He‚Äôs a part of the base game
---
Oh thx for info on the truth because everyone was like "oh i got mine I got mine " n I was confused n yea for outbreak it still sais the door locked even though I have rat king,I tried it on another character and it still was locked
---
Actually raises a lot of questions that I currently remember, but I remember something about her going exo outside of normal means.
---
Which then raised the question of why exo's need those memory wipes, what the deepstone crypt is etc. Wish I could recall more but this was all back when I was wiki/lore video diving hard a few months ago and my memory is... Not great.
---
This years is way less Grundy in my opinion. It‚Äôs only been 3 days and I have my hunter done and I‚Äôm on blue for my warlock and that‚Äôs only like 7 hours a day on the game. Last year was way worse. If it was like last year I would still be on my first piece  of gear
---
Dude it's so easy with Crown of Tempest. The arc supers are great for killing many mobs

Yeah and every game we get into it seems people are higher ranks and my team is clearly way lower. It‚Äôs frustrating
---
It took me 12 hours total in one session. You could play 1 hour a day and have it done in two weeks
---
Cause, ghost, tonight
---
And if the owner of the car abducts a king, does that make him The Taken King?
---
He‚Äôs a moron, but still the game looks as good as BL2, remember he‚Äôs only the boss, the people who worked on the actual game have to be talented individuals.
---
Oh look the turn tables
---
That‚Äôs part of Io. The red legion ruptured its surface while mining for the traveler‚Äôs energy.
---
1.5 actually, which from what I hear is positively average. Btw, 29 years old and don't watch any of the streamers, nor am I a follower of *anybody*. I heard some "kids" (apparently that's an okay generality to you) talk about Datto in competitive while grinding for recluse (sitting at 2238 glory btw) so I figured I'd watch a vid or two.
---
I can definitely see why you'd defend him- you sound like the toxic majority of the community who would, no matter what. :D I'm waiting for those google results btw, if you're so skeptical I'm just saying shit with no evidence maybe you should look it up yourself and realize I'm not the only person saying it.

I always find that for some reason titan players seems to be the most funny people that just think the whole caveman asthestic is hilarious.

I played them all legitimately on my first grind with warlock but on my titan i decided to go afk and eat pizza. Saw a lot of team mates doing this too and i don't blame them.
---
Yeah i got it : )
---
Those who use it but willingly admit it's broken are somewhat respectable, at least they own up to it. Those who outright defend it because they rely on it to top the scoreboard are the true villains.

I swear- by the amount of people who actually know how to activate the heroic, you'd think that public event was more complicated than a freaking raid.

Datto covers everything and is great as well. Cheese Forever is not very well known but he's great at showing how to cheese most activities. Ehroar does great number crunching on weapon damage.

You can join the clan I'm in. It's called worlds worst pvp. Look it up on the companion app. We play almost everyday and wouldn't mind more people. PM me if you have any questions. PSN is BigDGrzzyl

It's a Solstice-event. It's not meant to be innovative or game-changing. It's meant to kill time and keep people grinding.
---
Congrats man. I just finished my second character (titan) and only have hunter left to do now but still deciding whether i should or not as it's my least played class. I'll have to think about it i guess but for now, after 15 hours of none stop grind, it's time to sleep.

Oh, no I might have lost that last week, I'd have to win all three of my games this week then.

When me and my 2 friends did it,

We killed at least 8 in like what, 5mins?

So like 12 EAZ runs and we were done in an hour or so.

Even if it‚Äôs 10 gambit prime matches instead of normal gambit it still takes longer than an hour and way longer than EAZ.

and that means Darci is bad? ok boomer

It sorta feels like a pseudo-raid boss, does the immune stuff better than exodus crash that's for sure
---
I was too busy looking up my "save the recording button" that I got killed by a.. you guessed it another Lord of Wolves.
---
Ohhh lol
---
That sounds right if you beat both encounters
---
And so it begins
---
Haha, my bad, it was a good shit (:
---
Were you working together and all tagging a miniboss before killing it or what?
---
His account is 26 days old meaning he‚Äôs an insta refugee but he used emojis meaning he broke the rules making him normie scum
---
Nice lol
---
Yeah we got riposte and crystals so it was pretty easy
---
Nah pc, I had the base game on xbone but hadn‚Äôt played since any of the dlcs came out.
---
REEEEEEpost
---
You have to do it in the Bergusia forge, it's the only forge it can drop at.
---
are you serious or should I like *fight you?*
---
"Cool I landed my blade barrage, time for the explosion damage to do it's thi-"  
---
IMMUNE IMMUNE IMMUNE IMMUNE IMMUNE IMMUNE
---
It's not but what sucks is yeah we paid for it like 2 years ago and now it free. The really hard part is that we paid for a $60 game and more than a hundred bucks of dlc later and now it's free to play. It's a hard pill to swallow but that being said I'm glad it's free and we only have to play for expansions from here on. The game being free floods the gate with new members (hopefully) so we can get more cool stuff.
---
3-2-1....-1...-2.... a critical error has occurred. WHAT GAVE YOU THE RIGHT
---
Unlock all the main quests like the forges, menagerie and reckoning. That‚Äôs where I would start. Just look up guides for those 3 activities because they give a lot of powerful gear and they are like somewhat main story quests
---
Says the person who tries to get the last word by completely ignoring the conversation and personally attacking me. Pretty hypocritical. At least I was keeping on topic and attacking your argument, I never said anything about you, just that I don't think you have a good argument at all. And you cared enough to make your first comment and defend yourself, so you are just a liar.
---
But honestly, if you didn't respond to this comment, I would forget about you. What makes you think I care about impressing you?
---
This day exacts a heavy toll...
---
Y‚Äôall need to wait for dis crazy nigga Eramis
---
We are not getting new supers but nerf bottom tree striker and bottom tree dawnblade and buff arcstrider
---
Same....
---
Somebody get this (wo)man a medal!
---
Lmao, my group found it out day 1 and saw it was counting super kills on the ads in gambit, then the next day I saw it counting everything out in the open worlds too.
---
I would love a new super, where when people start the game, they treat each other in LFG like back in a day when the game started and we didnt have a clue and actually needed each other. That would be a nice super...
---
I think Netflix should pay me to watch the Office because I bought all the seasons on iTunes back when they first aired, and now everyone else just gets them for free. It's not fair /s
---
What they should do is make it so if you use celestial in PvP, it has a super large radius so that you can hit everyone on the map and kill everything
---
Omg I'm sorry, but I laughed way to hard at this!
---
Yeah, as I said I think that people who bought the base game should get atleast the Shadowkeep or some silver etc... Basically, now it‚Äôs just wasted money on game that is going to be free, which was not announced in any way, If it was, I would wait.
---
TY
---
Yeah, we‚Äôve probably all had that thought... but it was worth $60 to you when you bought it,  
---
This‚Äôll help. Take that $60, add the cost of DLCs, and now divide by your total playtime.
---
This is what he took them in please Oryx let me see my kids
---
Ideal! Thanks awsome, youre awesome.
---
I CAN'T UPVOTE ENOUGH
---
You realize your supposed to do it in a span of 3 weeks. So that‚Äôs on you if you want it done in 2 days
---
I mean, we do have nearly an entire month to do it, so if it really isn‚Äôt that much of a priority then you can take your time and it won‚Äôt feel as big as a grind.
---
I know but I‚Äôm really word it‚Äôs still going to be resilience set which I don‚Äôt use and we won‚Äôt be able to grind random rolls anymore when 2.0 comes out.
---
Maybe they shouldn‚Äôt have made their ship out of  unlocked door for us open and raid the living f out of it
---
Nevermind
---
There needs to be mechanics during the fight or attacks from the boss that make them feel real like we're actually fighting (i.e the Harpy's and nets during Argos fight)
---
A new exotic pulse rifle lol
---
yeah but at least you can still get the stuff you already had back
---
lol I met a guy on Omegle who‚Äôs birthday was October 5th he didn‚Äôt even know that shadow keep was delayed until his birthday until I told him.
---
But how was that your first kill friend
---
The striker super feels like it lasts as long as spectral blades used to be, and its horrifying. Luckily Stomp-335 carry my ass to safety when I don‚Äôt get killed instantly
---
During raids? The boss fights have plenty of mechanics. I don't think I get what you're saying.
---
Wait nova bomb you were meant to do the thing
---
When you complete all the requirements you need to meditate in the white statue at the right of Eva.
---
Thanks
---
It‚Äôs insane though, it‚Äôs old strikers AOE kill all in one spot then like 6 more kills
---
Ah, thanks for the help
---
But what if my explosive rounds Manannan SR4 becomes the meta some day...
---
Joined late
---
Thank you :)
---
Did u just downvote an Xbox user..... you have no soul......
---
What do you mean?
---
I mean during the fights like riven doesn't shoot back or do any attacks the CoS boss just sends thrall and sotp boss just sits there it doesn't feel like we're fighting them imo it's just point and shoot
---
map and hold e/l2/lt
---
Nah, fuck 'em. They basically tried to wipe out Humanity and they can't be trusted as a whole.
---
any weapons or shaders etc you already got from the factions are in your collections and can be required for a small price
---
A little Astroverse to top it all of, and voila!
---
Wait a minute. This isn‚Äôt Destiny-
---
Lol nice!!
---
Asylum?
---
Oh. They haven‚Äôt been around since I‚Äôve been in the game. No stuff for me. Oh well.
---
Sort of!  It increases your loot tracking to 50 meters, so you can be less precise when searching for them.
---
Pretty good, though most lfgs are only raids, but it makes sense. During the day there's generally 50+ lfgs and in the playlists you can find people. Crucible takes a while though.
---
Honestly I mind the Fallen a lot less ever since the Red War, considering Ghaul basically put us on the same level as them.
---
The reason is you shouldn‚Äôt have to go through to the specific item it should just be there.
---
And about drops in the world, most ships don‚Äôt drop but we have a tab for that
---
Tbf, I completed it this way before I ever got the right cabal boss
---
btw I know Apollo's saying I made a post saying "CoO is better than black armory" but forreal, use that search function and see if the post even it exists. Even if it was deleted, it'd come up.
---
Alas, the post doesn't exist. Js. Never happened. Dudes making shit up.
---
Me? I think it‚Äôs kinda dumb, but that doesn‚Äôt matter. What do you think about your tattoo? That‚Äôs all that matters.
---
Don‚Äôt eat it! It‚Äôll betray you with delicious garlic parm bread
---
probably not.
---
just play, and do activities that give progress to multiple tasks.
---
Lol, I totally called that...
---
Let me explain something to you: I tried finding the answer elsewhere and couldnt; hence why I posted it myself here.
---
Also, let me get something straight: You guys promote and allow the same exhausted memes and copy/pasted mindless content to be incessantly posted on your page yet you don't allow perfectly valid questions regarding recent/upcoming content to be asked here...? Right. Real tasteful.
---
So whatever, I got my question answered. You failed. You were too late. I win.
---
How sleep deprived are, asking for a friend?
---
Thanks alot! Good to know that super Mods do less while killing.
---
I have a full time job, child, managing a move across the country in 2 weeks, and selling my house....still completed a set in 2 days.
---
Time management is a powerful skill to learn.
---
Is that bitch still purple? They made all their players to endure this purple thing with broken sound more then a year.
---
Agreed.
---
Credit to user /u/uNewt for the picture
---
I like the quick intermission of straight up murdering his teammate there.
---
I know.  I was just being a try hard funny man.
---
Yeah, she was pretty nuts. I enjoy the more pushy bosses as apposed to the "slam, you were too close". I would enjoy more bosses proofing away or straight up just letting you hang out, and charge a shield that you then have to shoot through as punishment for being too close. Nothing insane like making them immune, but enough to not let people shot gun a boss forever with no consequences.
---
What a risky transaction, have my upvote
---
They do know they can share the God Orb with the Humans right?
---
Yeah probably also the fact that you're timed and your goal is to make her go immune
---
Thank you. I appreciate that. I will make sure I‚Äôm not a scrub
---
You can pull it from collections. Sadly all the objectives are reset though
---
Agreed! Every other time I launch one they get distracted by a piece of tinfoil in the middle of a field... In Nebraska or some shit
---
Yeah. Actually, thinking about it, Xol wasn‚Äôt TOO bad of a boss but supers might as well be useless. And if you have a Jot√ºnn you might as well be able to 1 phase him. I think a worm boss would be pretty fun if more polished. And I definitely love the idea of multiple bosses at once. And I only get annoyed by the slam melee if it kills you because you touched a wall or something. Because whenever it slams you, you can just punch the boss and you won‚Äôt move.
---
Pc player base is definitely gonna skyrocket once cross save comes online
---
That's some wholesome content right there. I just hope you spout mayhem lines every so often in your best shaxx voice.
---
Yeah she gets a little testy but she‚Äôs like family now
---
This is brilliant ahah, I never seem to get tower lobbies like this, no one will even do the hug emote with me rip
---
Not even close.
---
My comment was on the majestic gear lmao. I'm up to like 2,000 key fragments from the 100 light afk forge thing so all ive been doing is gathering boxes. You kids get mad just to be mad lmao. Likely Recluse tryhards.
---
I have 2 tributes left both for bright dust but I'm saving up for either a glow or something else and I'll buy them after the event.
---
You'll probably spend the same amount now as later. It's a great game and I can't recommend it enough. Careful though, it's highly addictive!
---
Just make sure you're doing the right kind of specific activity and subclass type specified in the challenge
---
Do you have it equipped?? Otherwise it won‚Äôt count progress
---
Match the burn.
---
Lucky my broke up with me because of destiny, it was her or curse of Osiris 
---
I got screwed over that why I hate mercury so much
---
What you're forgetting is that the first time you went into the raid it wasn't that easy. Sure you can one phase everything with the meta exotics or the raid exotic, that doesn't mean you never struggled.
---
Poor guy :(
---
Umm has Trevor been mating?
---
Hit details and read the flavor text for better info on the requirements.
---
This \^ I was having same problem then realized what the problem was
---
Kids who are too young to know what porn is shouldn‚Äôt be playing a violent video game. Meanwhile swearing is just plain rude and annoying.
---
True.
---
Different strokes for different folks, right? I myself am a very impatient person, so I decided to bang out Luna's, Recluse and Breakneck over the course of a weekend when I first got them, and then did Redrix the following week. That was a special kind of hell, as I absolutely detest any and all PVP activities.
---
To be fair, we've been waging a genocidal war for the past six years and have collectively annihilated millions just to protect "our" ball...
---
Had about 110k before this week and i bought so many things lmao
---
For me it is
---
I feel sorry for them sometimes
---
Message them
---
Unfortunately, at the price point of ninety-fucking-seven legendary shards, I'm not going to be finding out immediately.
---
And regarding your light level you should be able to get up to about 393
---
Tbh it's bungie fault for making people play gambit. It's the worst mode in the game. Still wouldn't afk myself but you can't blame people for cheesing it not everyone has time to play shit content
---
My tired brain typed out CoS for the Crown of Sorrow raid....but it's actually supposed to be the Scourge of the Past raid. xD
---
So for example one of my tasks is to get solar melee final blows. I have to wait for the solar day and make sure I have solar on to complete this?
---
Anyone else say it in the voice
---
I absolutely love the lore, but I still feel that for casual people it's hard to truly understand all of it. Most of the stuff gets mentioned, but if you dont look into it, that as far as you'll ever know.
---
Ah cool. Thanks for the post anyways, it‚Äôs really nice :)
---
Thanks! They were kinda fun to make.
---
As a fellow 6th gen Camaro owner this thing better have a V8 in it or so help me.
---
The Calus-mini tool is great
---
I don't understand why being from California is supposed to be negative. I'm Canadian.
---
You mean misfit
---
You get ten, for some reason I held on to 300-350 different shaders and I don't know which ones gave me bright dust, I think Legendary ones did but some gave me shards so I held on to them if I ran in to a shard dry spell. Sorry for the late response just did and hour and a half playthrough of the EAZ to kill those damn mini bosses.
---
only if it has that stupid long barrel like in the Joker meme
---
You want to use accurised and truesight as range is mainly what you want
---
Nice I'm almost done with mine
---
I believe that bungie said the glow is stronger when you have a subclass with the same element equipped.
---
The 1500 orbs is just orbs, doesn't matter what type. Hope this helps.
---
Beloved earns her name...
---
don't worry about those douchebags  
---
  
---
post away tom
---
I'm so close to being done I pulled a few all nighter's

Not shooting and stabbing anything that moves would go a long way. Just saying...
---
End of August I believe.
---
On‚Äôy one i saw was 101 $cad
---
Reminds me of my race to infamy-reset. Could not touch Gambit for three weeks, after that. So I feel for you.
---
I like you guys.
---
You and your friend didn't try to start an exotic emote party that not everyone has access to, causing people to feel left out.
---
Everyone could join, and everyone could have fun, and that's what makes this a great game sometimes.
---
Do you still live in Canada? If that‚Äôs the case then I understand why you think that. It‚Äôs because California is the shithole of the USA. You can literally look up videos of homeless tents all around L.A and the streets are littered with trash and Poot. It‚Äôs just sad to see a beautiful state being treated so poorly
---
SURFING TITAN'S WAVES. SIVA NANOBOTS. LOCATING RASPUTIN'S BRAIN. FINDING THE JUJU BIRD. PAINTING THE LEVIATHAN. DRIVING THE DRIFTER INSANE.
---
As you can see there's a whole lot of stuff to do before the Moon's Haunt this fall...
---
So stick with us 'cause Praedyth and Saint are gonna do it all!!
---
So stick wIth us 'cause Praedyth and Saint are gonna do it all!!
---
Ha! OP read the instructions and believed them!
---
Dynamax Ghastly!
---
When you are in an area with many enemies and you die to a shank
---
A grind it is.  I just finished getting the set on my hunter, and the only thing I want now is to not play Destiny 2 again.  Good job Bungie!
---
Can't wait for Borderlands 2 to come out!
---
Made with mematic
---
Lol, That one Guardian that hops into frame and turns quickly towards them
---
Gotta flex the grind just a lil bit ü§´
---
It's much easier to progress the event (by killing the enemies and the domes) until the third phase and THEN shoot the angry sky orb. You'll use way less ammo that way.
---
Warlock please!!!
---
Most towers I'm in are dead
---
it so **FUN** grinding this when i only have 2 hours a day to play and its on xbox so load times are **FUN** 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
**END ME**
---
If you need to purchase the game...  wait until October, if you already have a copy of the game, jump in and give it a go.  
---
For me I play for the raiding with my clan, the guns that do the pew pew, the big numbers, the loot and most importantly...   the grind.    Some people enjoy the lore, I am more interested in the gear drops and triumphs.   Some people play for the pvp, I am definitely not one of those people, I love the PvE.
---
It ricochets ???!??!
---
Thanks man. Just makes me sad that the forsaken enemies take up the same loot table as the vanilla ones. So if the forsaken version of the black exodus high value target spawns the vanilla cant and it spawns so much more often. I think going to trost EDZ works but ill try giant scar/lost oasis too.
---
Im curious why its bugged. Kinda a big problem yknow.. gives people the wrong idea and if they dont know they could potentially think something else is a high value target and its just a vicious cycle. Thank you for the information though i appreciate it
---
It gave you the momentum you needed
---
It‚Äôs actually the rose with frumious blue
---
I‚Äôm not complaining about losing for losing, i‚Äôm complaining about unfairly losing due to an imbalance in team members, which is on bungie, not me.
---
Yeah I remember looking up some lore and I know that Dead Orbit was mentioned but dont know their involvement
---
You took on 2 supers and still had 1/3 of the bar left? Amazing *cries in titan bubble*
---
I think that the one of the nine that helped him did so because they either didnt believe or wanted to test the whole "we cant exist without life in the system" fact
---
Provided what I read was right, you remember Outbound Signal? How the Dantalion Exodus VI was transmitting somewhere out into space? Apparently they were contacting the Red Legion for assistance and Dead Orbit intercepted the transmission; I also heard DO fought the Legion on their way to Earth but I'm not sure if that part's true.
---
You must not look at the comments on posts about titans in PvP and PvE
---
I just like to post about easy collection grabs
---
So i'll tell you again the way to remady that is to get a team. The reason you are not getting full teams is half on bungie amd half on the fact that compared to 4 stacks no one is really solo queing at this point in the season
---
My mum put a sparkler in my pizza and sang happy birthday
---
could it just be u put on some blue armor and took a pic
---
Either way fuck that one of the Nine
---
Imagine seeing a bunch of fully armed soldiers walking around a mall like a train or dancing different dances from each other without any music and the occasional 2 soldiers trying but failing to sync their dance moves.
---
Thats what guardians would look like in present day
---
We've been through the bad and the good together, guardian.
---
