TIL you can use Sentinel block while jumping
---
---
---
thank you
---
I run dust rock and recluse in PvE and whatever heavy fits the element modifier so I‚Äôll upgrade those first I guess
---
What's with people playing with super good advice a lot lately?
---
I'm the opposite.  Best Bygones I've gotten is the vendor roll, Full Auto/Kill Clip and my Chattering Bone is the curated one from Riven, though if I'm honest I'd like to find one with Full Auto/Rampage and Light Mag.  I got really lucky with my Blast Furnace and got Feeding Frenzy/Kill Clip on the very first one.  Since then I've gotten 2 or 3 with Outlaw/Rampage.

SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND

If they do being it back they better revamp it pretty hard. It would be exciting to make actual choices outside of just goofing around. People quickly forget that there were only 2 or 3 solid builds in each sub tree very similar to the nodes we have now. If they do bring it back (which I would love, dont get me wrong) they're gonna need to give thought to making more Meaningful choices outside of a few key skills.
---
The same people on dtg are on here, dont let em fool you.
---
Theres a way where even if everyone but one person dies you can all get the flawless run.
---

---
  Make sure the survivor doesnt head to the chest once he beats the run. 
---
  Everyone else spawns and goes to the cave the winner would exit from and climb up to the *still unopened* chest. 
---
Once youre *all* up there make sure you guys gather up closely and then open chest at the same time.
---
Its how I got the triumph.

Warlock.
---
*cough* I'd rather have 2 fusion grenades
---
Depends on what hand bag I'm carrying
---
It does literally just did it an hour ago with my clan
---
Huckleberry and my wishbringer
---
The servitor does not kill cowards
---
We did it but still not working, then we use the an video to guide us to Calus room
---
Not EVERYTHING synergizes well. Top tee Hammers has a dog-shit neutral game and is a one-trick pony.
---
No you have to get it from Izanami it can drop on armor or frames so getting that thing from Ada that drops an armor piece when you do a frame increases your chance
---
Did you have two ethereal keys?
---
Alright, thanks for the help. I‚Äôm about to go run one right now.
---
the first wish gives you a key for free
---
Man I really do not like you. I was relatively lucky but it took me 6 runs, although I only have one character, so thats 6 weeks lmao
---
That dude with the sentinel shield was trying to get his super back lol
---
I'm sorry, I don't know what the problem could be.
---
Titans...if you find yourself with a broken sparrow and the devil Servitor bearing down on you...Thundercrash at that motherfucker. 
---
You never know, it might just work. 
---
Either way people will remember you as the glorious crazy Titan bastard that you are. Never gave up, never surrendered.
---
I wish it was like that for me
---
Yes, go forth my titan brother. Punch them till they cry
---
What roll on your Hazard? I got triple tap and quickdraw.
---
ok. you can chose between ace + shotgun or tlw + sniper. Outbreak + shotgun + RotB or Nf + dustrock + wardcliff are options, too.
---
Just accept it that hard light is ok and it‚Äòs fun but it‚Äòs not one of the top choices for crucible exotic slot
---
It‚Äôs the best gun in the game wym
---
Same. We spent 2 hours and it was my first time doing the raid. My friend said that he wouldn‚Äôt talk to me for a day.
---
Ah that makes sense. Yeah I'm not gonna go with in game currency. I'd rather not give home cash and in game currency feels like the same
---
Fuck you man, jk happy for you, just been staring at 53 completions all with a key and still no 1k for about 1 hour
---
Cool anime.
---
u/dmg04
---
It's not the focus of the clip, but it looks like you were a little bit lucky near the end. The other titan's first melee seems to have missed.
---
What raid is this from?
---
Wait, what, what, waaat?
---
I hate being alive.
---
It‚Äôs the start of the last season for this years season pass. You will be getting to see new content along with the rest of the community which can be exciting.  That being said the forge season and the gambit season have been less than ideal content wise. A few cool things here and there but that‚Äôs about it. Do you game with a group or are you solo? If you prefer the solo experience I would just suggest passing.
---
Did he just, say deinstall instead of uninstall?  
---
Also nope never had much issues with blizzard app
---
We talking original cheez it‚Äôs here or something a little more fancy?!
---
What SMG is that?
---
Yea probably
---
Might be wise to update again in near future. 
---
On Ark Survival i was getting framedrops on 1 gpu driver patch and on the next it was fixed. I'm assuming something similiar might 've happened here.
---
This is payback for the spectral blades.
---
Crown of Sorrow looking great!
---
I just got it and it is really fun, but it‚Äôs not nearly as good in pvp as people think it is. Yeah it sucks when you get killed from across the map because you did t see the projectile coming, but those are hard to intentionally land. I actually prefer it in PvE more, shreds packs of grunts and takes out majors and ultras like a charm.
---
Whats the name of that ship again?
---
Game designers : we spent months working tirelessly to bring realistic dynamic shadows to the game to help creat an immersive and compelling experience. 
---
Players : * do stuff like this *
---
It's important to add you also need a well of Radiance to do this.
---
Kairos Bronze. Looks boujee af

---
The  Dancing Shadow Titan can‚Äôt hurt you honey, it‚Äôs just in your dreams
---
Yes they do. However Nightfalls have a higher chance.
---
Fuccccckkkkkkkk
---
I built my PC under the assumption I‚Äôd enjoy playing Destiny more by myself at 200+ FPS over my PS4 friend.
---
I was wrong, nothing beats playing with friends, especially with trivial at best improvements in gameplay.
---
You bastard
---
I heard if we kill her, we might get cayde back..
---
"Rasputin The most powerful weapon of the golden age. What are its defenses? Heh, good luck trying to even play minecraft on this bad boy, the controls are ancient."
---
Yeh akella is kind of right, people need to stop spamming the reddit with mediocrity
---
Had this happen to me as well. If you progress too quickly through that strike, you have to wait at the ledge for a few minutes until the dialog happens. Otherwise it instant kills you every time you try to move past that ledge.
---
Gaw damn! GG's!
---
Titan is his spirit animal
---
See I‚Äôve already got a sweet pc, but all my progress is on PS4 along with all my friends. I just wish I could cross save.
---
I‚Äôd be so shitty if my team lost to a guy rocking Graviton Lance and an auto rifle lol good game
---
I DON'T WANT THAT OMELETTE
---
I know right that was shitty I had to make Bungie so all d1 triumphs were useless
---
The real horror is last word in pve
---
I‚Äôm gonna have to second the angry all caps yelling guys post !
---
No problem
---
Truly terrifying.
---
It should be though.
---
privacy settings. U need to allow invitations
---
Woah look at the bullet animations as the video ends, super weird
---
I‚Äôm a mixed main between hunter n titan. If u on ur titan and you see it coming you can jump last second or kinda side step it
---
For fireteam under roster? If so it's set to public.
---
Him just waiting there being impatient
---
You fight the Rifleman in the game.  He has mirrored clones.
---
Yeah, but since OP doesn't know anything about the game, idk if they'd have a code for the replica and $777,777 is a bit steep lol.
---
Kind of playing off the whole Sagira possession thing, what about a split/dual personality for Ghosts for extra voice quips while out in the world? Like Lilacror from Baldur's Gate 2? Or some kind of tyrannical drill sergeant?
---
What system are you playing on?
---
Tying to rank up twice in one sitting? lol.
---
Me too man. Tomorrow after work I'm getting me that sweet dredgen glowy word above my head
---
Ticks?!
---
Definitely do not use that level 30 boost on ur first character. Really experience the game the first time. Second. Ok. Third. Ok. Not ur first. On PC there is text chat. On consoles there is in games chat so like voice.
---
We got memed on
---
if you truly believe that you're a fool.
---
You fight shadow demons
---
Step Up: Forsaken
---
I'm shaking
---
Every public event has a secret objective that, if you get it in time, upgrades the loot (it's called a heroic public event). If you just focus on killing whatever's in front of you, you might ruin that objective for more experienced players, so go look up how to get the heroic event for each type of public event before you start shooting so as to not bug other players.
---
Big disappointment.
---
It will be more of the same: constant nerfing and buffing, glitchy gameplay, YouTube favoritism...
---
Thumbs down.
---
Not quite ready yet. You have 2 other characters to fill up!
---
Oh.
---
By Darkness they meant
---
literal darkness.
---
Huh.
---
Still got recluse :p
---
This belongs on /r/Fireteams.
---
It'll get more traction there.
---
Backup mag adds 4 bullets on recluse, that's a hard pass
---
I use minor spec and tear through red bars
---
Backup mag on luna's is nice though
---
It can be done, but it's so much grind and boring.
---
The schematic finally dropped s minute ago, of course its the rifle I already have. The grind continues.
---
They were added in recently, and because of that unlock when you get the base pages
---
No definitely not.
---
21% is definitely worth it. Especially for clearing Zero Hour adds.
---
I don't like DIM. I'll try to transfer guns from one character to another and it will send it to the wrong place. It makes me nervous and is annoying.
---
Another gun I wish I had friends to play with
---
I would say EoW is the easiest, the least mechanic raid of the group and short.
---
Thanks man, ive sorted out my mic now and yes, I will look it up online. What I went through last night with the team saying such things almost put me off raids - it was tough.
---
Different rule set. r/DTG doesn't allow link posts at all, so no memes. That and this is a smaller subreddit, so there's less salt by proxy. Something I've seen a lot on DTG is that the r/Destiny2 people are so happy because they aren't from D1 and don't know what they lost, which doesn't seem true at all.
---
IMO, it's because of the ack of memes, and the enforced seriousness a lot of the posts have that bring salt. This sub has 0 backseat dev posts.
---
This is definitely the better sub in that case
---
Claptrap?
---
I fear no man. But that thing, it scares me...
---
I don't even need to tell you why this was removed.
---
For Lunas: Target Adjuster or Icarus Grip
---
For Recluse: Counterbalance Stock or Freehand Grip, I guess? Counterbalance just seems to be the go to for every SMG on console. If you're on PC, I guess you could use Icarus as well to kill *all* spread on the weapon.
