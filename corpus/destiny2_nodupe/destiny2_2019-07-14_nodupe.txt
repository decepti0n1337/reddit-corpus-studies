Heya bud. If you want an easy fix, get some friends( either 8 or 12.) And form a kill lobby. 
---
What does this entail? Have each fire team leader be somebody that is in the same timezone and reasonable close to eachother. They will count down and launch into the playlist at the same time. Have 1 person on each team watch the lobby board to make sure yall are connecting to eachother. Now, start queu dodging till you find eachother. Make sure 1 team doesnt 1 sidedly win the game, ( stay close in score with 1 person from each team slaying the other.) And you will be able to farm this out collectively for hours. 
---
This works for mtn top and revoler kills.
---
NO this is NOT a banable offense.  
---
Yes This takes on averages 2-4 games per person ( game type depending.)
---
---
---
Same thing happened to me
---
“I have been falling for 30 minutes”
---
Bet you regret that title now, or is that the 9000iq play.
---
Nice!
---
Hey just so you know celestial is best burst damage as it can do max
---
Yes, cross-save will apply across all platforms
---
Trust me no hunter helmets look horrible from the back in d2
---
Ye

Quick! Put up a Ward of Dawn on the walker before a blueberry shreds it!
---
Someone created a Facebook event to raid Area 51 and 500,000 have signed up although lots of people have admitted they won't actually go supposedly based on an article talking about it.
---
You can tho the tornadoes move only slightly faster and there's travel time also arc supers give maximum speed and others don't
---
One eyed mask rewards ppl for playing worse, or running away. You can chain insta kill melees with isf. You can kill a super with shoulder charge and peregrine greaves instantly. You can kill many people if they are in front of you by using barricade with that one helmet. If you take the time to look around, you might see something. Crazy idea right?
---
take my updoot fellow guardian
---
A lot of those are forcing themself through the Mountaintop Quest. Personally, after 3 weeks to get my own and knowing what pain many of then go through, I will pay my respect to the steadily decline of their souls and mental health...
---
Just progress the forge a bit. The only reason afk works is because the encounter ends after 1 min. Push that out a bit and they will be returned to orbit.
---
Looks like I am bait that is just surprised to be invited then.
---
I love this
---
They should implement a feature that if you’re taking longer to bank, Drifter gets crankier and overall more upset, and his call outs to bank slowly get more aggressive. Maybe even call out to the guardian in question in the lower left like “[Username] should bank their motes...” or Drifter tells the Guardian(s) in question to bank their motes. Something like “What’re you doing?! You still got motes? Bank already; your team’s waiting!”
---
I see you forgot to add blade barrage hunters as well
---
i havent completed the raid but i do have the 2 assault rifles can i still join plz
---
Came here to ask this
---
I reeeeerally hope we see some cosplay guardians making a fire team.
---
Ok so here's the thing shoulder charge is easily countered by current meta and getting charged while in your super is your fault for not being aware of your surroundings you can oneshot them in your super there is no reason for you not to kill them
---
Did did you just call kepris horn good are you daft 1 you'll die before the barricade is placed
---
2 it's just a second grenade in the form of a barricade
---
Was wondering the same thing.
---
OP is great, nothing beats the chain of nanites that will continuously spawn more and more of themselves after each kill
---
grammar dragon
---
1k voice is 1k trains
---
It only happens when it does the 'the enemy is moving against each other' thing
---
Yes.
---
I’ve hit fabled and done every step but double kills, and I’m 92% on that. But damn it makes me salty asf whenever I miss an easy double kill or die to a blade barrage.
---
Thank you, it’s been driving me crazy. Take some gold my friend
---
You can make one of each class and play between them all, sounds like you did a Titan already and possibly didn't like it? Hunters are fast and I personally mained as one since D1, warlock is fun. I say give them all a shot and then pick what you felt more comfortable with and had more fun with
---
This was data-mined bois 100% trust
---
Ah. I see. Thank you very much.

Go into pursuits tab then exit you should spawn

It's probably just a lab coat and a ghost badge that only opens 1/3 of the doors in the base.

The same dark lightning appears on the nightmares from the shadowkeep trailer, and a large taken tentacle entity also appears in the black garden so there are theories that the black garden is the source of this

Nice

Edit has been made :)

This literally just happened to my group 3 times in a row. I've lost nearly 200 points in comp because of this. We won a match, went to the score screen, it kicked us from the score screen and it counted as a loss.

I’m done with Jotunn of puns

I have been getting guitar for the past half hour. I can't even load into the tower. I can't start crucible match. I can't do nothin. It will start the loading screen then 30 seconds later BAM back to orbit. Guitar. This most recent patch has fucked so many things.

There's an outrageous fortune of puns here boys

Its a very very good exotic. Hands down top 3 for me

The Devil You Don’t
---
A good game should make you want to play the Multi-player,  and especially the online competitive.  Destiny has a good story. But it's gun play is terrible, to the point that I've seen three strategies. Slide shotgun, Snipe, and Super.  A Meta breaks a multi-player game.  Especially one where there's loot and equipment acquired through RNG.  For those who're lucky, it's stale.  For those not, it's infuriating.  It's not fun.  Why include something not fun in your game?
---
Depends.  Do you want any raid exclusive exotic? If so then yes.  You have to raid. Just like when I want the Last Word,  I HAVE to play Cruc.  Specifically,  I have to be the best cruc Player out there. Whereas for Raid exotics you just have to....  Survive?  Win?  You get the picture.
---
I wish
---
careful friend, drag his name into anything and you will be met with hate. keep politics away from games :(
---
Im not at pvp in the slightest in this game, i don’t really use meta weapons unless im forced to in competitive, even then the crucible part of LW isn’t as bad as it seems, its possible to get it done while also not being good at crucible, its just a matter of playing smart if you aren’t naturally good, also im not sayin this to be rude or anything, but maybe you should take a break from the quest if you are having a hard time, improve at playing crucible and then go back to the quest.
---
No. I don’t. Lol.
---
I once got killed by the architects yesterday. I was standing on a walkway in the first area of "the arms dealer" strike. It was a dredgen who suddently had decided to fly through a wall at a massive velocity. I was crushed to death by a wall at the other side of the airfield
---
I believe bungo tweeted about knowing about the issue couldnt finish a raid with it happening and didnt get rewards for an encounter for a while after I did it while in orbit lmao
---
Knew I shouldn't have asked, as soon as I posted it I noticed my comment had all sorts of bad chu-chu.
---
Imo i dont think its balanced at least, not well enough in terms of viability, I believe any particular build/ loadout class should be VIABLE obviously there are always going to be weapons and abilities that outperform and thats natural but there shouldn't be such a clear disparity between the meta play and casuals, especially in quick play, where (be it a skill gap as it is) people LFG-ing to make a super sweaty 6-stack ruins many people's experience, skilled or not. So between Balance and ultimately a lack of good skill based matchmaking its no surprise people get salty about having to do crucible for a quest
---
Yea malfeasance isn't really worth using up the exotic slot. Truth is nice for invading,  wardcliff for boss damage. Maybe darci or whisper or arbalest if you're feeling frisky
---
took me a few but i finally figured it out. you sly bastard
---
 I couldn't play for 3 days because my ps+ ran out then I tried a blind well yesterday got 2 exotics in 1 run. ~~both are pretty much useless to me but oh well.~~
---
When I have huckleberry and a bunch of thrall run towards me
---
Take off the jotunn, dismantle it and never ever take it out of your collections again
---
Yes September 17th
---
I have terrible luck with wish bones.
---
That's what I'm rocking
---
Seeing icebreaker makes me miss D1!
---
I agree! The damage is fine but I feel the current availability of legendary scouts is medium to low. I'm crap at sniping in pvp which why I prefer scouts.

I'm a titan and my normal loadout is Sniper + Recluse and I *usually* top frag unless I'm being stupid and making bad decisions.
---
Your point of pain is using Scouts, they're currently on the low end of the performance spectrum, only exception is the much larger maps such as Equinox and Vostok.
---
Handcannons, Snipers, Pulse Rifles are your best bet in the current sandbox.
---
Handcannons would be Austringer, Rose, Thorn, Ace.
---
Snipers would be Beloved, Twilight Oath, Aachen LR2, Izanagi's Burden
---
Pulse rifles would be Bygones, Blast Furnace. 
---
I can't know what you're struggling with but if you detail it I can try to help. 
---
It's okay to not like the current sandbox. (I hated the sandbox when it was all Luna / NF and Spectral before it got nerfed etc) 
---
However you *can* survive in it and do well.

I can tell you in 1 sentence why it's great:
---
It's the only pulse that actually beats some heavy weapons in raid DPS phases
---
im gonna find one in area 51
---
"In the Crucible. And nowhere else" should have been a continuation
---
I’m in the same boat as you man. I’m looking forward to seeing what people respond with. I have heard that sometimes gahlran itches out and the damage phase doesn’t end. Like you one phase him and the encounter gets completed. Dunno what makes that happen though.
---
Its a curse of knowledge.

Thats at least my head cannon

Sounds like the beginning of a horror story
---
same thing happened to me, it also got pushed off the edge another time lol
---
Only thing I’m cheesing regarding Bad Juju is the forge resource farm— just putting 450LL gear on and it pairs with other ~450 afk’ers and I go to bed. Woke up with tons of planet mats, about to do the other planet and clean the house for a bit. The juju minimum is actually super easy to do, the right way— when you get the number for each step TOWARDS the gun, they give you an extra tribute anyway (the dog guards).
---
I thought this was a key detail about the whole cheese. If someone’s not lowering their light before doing this, that’s a little crappy.
---
I believe doing a powerful frame improves your chances.
---
I have the free version of the the game that included dlcs up to but not including forsaken and arbalest dropped for me this week....
---
I think the first time you get it it has to be powerful
---
I'm so stupid... I'm a tad drunk
---
So do I only get 2 chances each week?
---
oi mate ur gonna need some riskrunners in there for the tasers
---
###Y E E T###
---
Lol Loaded Question in comp, you brave soul
---
Lmao clearly is photoshop dude
---
Probably because this would make things harder on bungies end, more programming more pve balancing and more pve instances as the easiest way to do this would probably be to split players based on what rules they were playing by.
---
Ya we were working on speedruns and 2 guys backed out after a bit and we were like "screw it you guys just wanna 4man it?" lol

Nani?

I just open the PS menu lol

Lol that’s soo broken bro 🤣🤣🤣 I only got a warlock and now seeing it from a titan POV. That’s actually broken.
---
Go to your pursuits tab...
---
The search bar is a magical thing.
---
A better question would be what is the planetary material of Nessus? You get 3 guesses.

Or Hunters that tether a boss that was hit with Melting Point.

He does have a valid point but your comment to top tier 😂

All those exotics and still not 750? I can relate..

Hahaha the definition of a panic super , Damm that should have been my title
---
/u/uwutranslator
---
There definitely is too much forced pvp for quests but for gambit you can just kill npcs.
---
I was wondering that the hell he was doing hahaha
---
#MARKED FOR VENGEANCE
---
Yeah that's why I like gambit more than crucible, except when they tell me to kill invader or invade..
---
Thanks! sounds strategic
---
Hell yeah!
---
Last Wish, Scourge and Crown of Sorrow are the three raids that give Powerful Loot. All other Leviathan raids (Leviathan, Spire, Eater,) don't give Powerful Loot anymore. So yes, you can do Scourge
---
You need to put some time in to the HC you want to use so like the other guy said use it for EVERYTHING until you learn all the intricacies of that particular weapon and its perks.
---
Wouldn't have been as successful am afraid for I am a garbage Titan
---
Sir, I won’t downvote you, but this is quite possibly the worst run on sentence I’ve ever come across.
---
Boy, you seem like a barrel of laughs
---
I see, I barely use hand cannon so I guess that's why I suck at it
---
r/ihadastronk
---
What are you going on about?
---
K
---
Yea that caught my attention to. How tf do you even get a job there??
---
Goooodbaaai dinklebooot
---
Sounds about right, yeah
---
We need a crucible gamemode where we can use as many exotics as we want. Only hard part would be choosing between wormhusk and knucklehead
---
Yep, I'd rather take damage in my super and not move than being juggled to death. I HATE that.
---
Well news flash it's not available anymore so you are out of luck
---
It was available at some point? Heck.
---
Need those exotic class items back from factions!!!!
---
Man... here I thought casting tether only resulted in my death...
---
But in all seriousness, it might have to do with the resilience level of each person tethered. Since it distributes damage to all parties, they may be taking less damage with a higher resilience
---
They should make a game mode in the Crucible, similar to trial of the nine, but exotics are allowed in every slot
---
Well....reduced damage, right? Lol
---
All that just to get aped by a godroll mindbenders.. lol
---
But doesn’t a spike militias birthright direct impact always one shot?
---
Yup but not anymore
---
When I went back in for the flawless I finished in one go
---
Tractor cannon buffs all void 50% that's the same as melting point and all others 33% so maybe my nighthawk Goldie will do a little less dmg but Titans are practically useless in pve you guys need a buff
---
Weapons slots are completely different not.  Similar to D1 but there are special and primary options (without the need for it being exotic) for both kinetic and energy slot.  Heavy is still basically heavy.  Armor has perks again and everything is random rolls sooooo.  There is no quick answer here.  Start pounding through the new content.  Better devils is still around.  All the choice or "meta" stuff is in activities that are unlocked at later light levels.  Riskrunner is still good for a lot of PVP.  Better Devils can drop with random rolls and Y2 weapons have an additional perk slot.  If you happen to have a bunch of tokens (not planetary) or weapon parts banked and want to see what the new stuff looks like just start dumping those.   Also there are bounties EVERYWHERE now.  Banshee is my new best friend
---
Ok, thank you. And would the enemies also he around my light level, if not higher?
---
I posted one lol
---
How did you manage to do this?
---
Hopefully it comes back, unless it was an exclusive.
---
So nine. 3 factions. 3 classes
---
We do :[
---
They are the humans, you are the ants
---
"am i really going to defile this grave for loot?
---
"of course i am!"
---
It was an exclusive eververse season set
---
Nope, Luna’s and NF are energy weapons.
---
How can you have all exos
---
Don't forget Thundercra... Oh wait
---
Yeah lmao but u guys are king of the crucible you guys have oem and by far the best roaming supers (besides dawn blade ig)
---
The weekly spider bounties you buy with ghost fragments are a good source as well.
---
I remember this one time where it was a 1v4 in survival on Javelin, and I didn’t have a super. So I popped my empowering rift and won 4 consecutive 1v1s against each member of the entire enemy team, and ended up winning the round. Sadly, Xbox didn’t clip the entire thing, only half of it.
---
I'd love to see an "Unlocked" Crucible mode where you could equip multiple exotics.
---
Dammit, that doesn't count though so hopefully it will
---
That’s why my flair is what it is, mwhahahah
---
I thought Spider bounties award exotic engrams ,  they’re just instantly decrypted.   That’s how I got mine.
---
I forgot to mention that fucking shoulder charge
---
It was an eververse cloak in season 4
---
Not for loot, for the cloak
---
Hehehehherhe
---
Those sets have never made a reappearance so don't get your hopes up
---
Alpha Lupi is trash. One tiny hp bump? Really?
---
Emote name op?
---
Oof, that means year one right? So there's a chance to get it.
---
What is this meme...its so stupid.
---
If it was year one there's a chance
---
I’ve been on Reddit for a year now and it still confuses the shit outta me sometimes
---
FYI, hardlight can be useful for breaking shields...
---
Same. It's wholesome with the title text. This better make it to hot.
---
Yeah, against a super alien demon thing but not a rock.......
---
Guessing that means I'm gonna need to find new versions of both to get the second perk slot, or is it just weapons that release in Y2 that get second perks?
---
Im thinking to run blast furnace, hard light and rocket launcher is that good enough ?
---
I think it was actually the season of the forge so whatever season that was because I had it at 700 but deleted it because of the new eververse change
---
I died to gravity.  That was it, wasn't going back through lol
---
Haha rocks are OP
---
Or armamentarium
---
because f*ck you that's why
---
Suppression grenade!
---
Yeah, so is laziness. Oh, 6 years and 98.987654321% of bosses use the same mechanic haha. I'm glad Bungie is free. That system seams like a k.i.s.s.(keep it simple stupid) Activision Idea.
---
Ive sensed you a pm
---
One eyed mask AND synthoceps
---
Effectively1 yes. The enemies will go up to I believe 585, but once you are 50 levels over it makes no difference and even then it's a small difference.
---
I didn’t realize you could shuffle... as a house music enthusiast I approve and will also copy you out of jealousy lol good job OP
---
this will make a fine meme
---
I think you mean, raiding area 51
---
I love that fuckin song it’s literally in every playlist I have
---
Not in my honest opinion, I remember cheesing as much of the raids as possible in D1, it's a part of the game, and a good way for Bungue to learn from their mistakes.  If this grind had more substance than just a material grind I'd be more inclined to not cheese it.  Just my opinion on the matter.
---
Lmao thanks
---
oh my Lord now I feel dumb as shit lmao
---
I love you too fellow guardian
---
I love you both
---
Me too
---
Ok, I haven't played Destiny 2 since the season of the drifter came out.
---
How in hell are you wearing so much Exotic at the same time?
---
They did attempt to fix guitar error multiple times, but it seems like it's a really hard bug for them to squash
---
*rabid Titan noises*
---
It does look kinda cool
---
The same thing happened to me haha
---
Yes
---
I’d honestly find more use for Mk. 44’s than Peregrine Greaves in crucible
---
Bitter pill I had to swallow is that Destiny just isn’t a game where everyone gets to earn everything. I really *want* Recluse, for example, but I’m probably never going to get it and even though it made me mad at first, I eventually accepted it and moved on and I’m way happier playing the game now. 
---
That being said TLW, Ace of Spades, and Thorn/Lumina are things I was able to do eventually even though I’m extremely a PvE player who generally doesn’t like or perform well in Crucible at all. It was definitely more time consuming for me than my friends but it can be done. The one where you lose progress was the worst but I did it over time by only playing on Mayhem week and Iron Banner week, where I tend to do a bit better. 
---
If you practice slowing down and playing more patiently and get decent in those modes, *and* if your competitive rank is super low (I’m generally somewhere between 0-200 glory because I suck hard), I can pop into comp and play a few rounds before I get high enough that my opponents get good and I have to back out. That always gives me a decent boost too.
---
Oh man, Asher looked like he was head bobbing, playing a synth.
---
how the
---
but when

😂👌 thx b
---
Dunno about that, but I'm upvoting just because you remeber that movie, and it's one of my faves.
---
That’s meant to be an ornament
---
Haha i know what you mean man. Really just a bunch of supers getting used and getting my head blown off by god himself with a sniper.
---
Yes yes I am ready to run Wormhusk Liars handshake Dragons shadow and Gemini jester all at once
---
Glad u think so lmao
---
r/MemeEconomy
---
This is perfect, reminds me of when I brought my wife to the area of the EDZ before she could actually damage anything and I popped my sentinel super to get her some loot.
---
Not sure what you are talking about, the invitations of the nine only reward a lore piece and a powerful piece of gear per visit, nothing else.
---
Nope- you must use what is considered 'true' black armoury gear so not just armour that is styled on or came out in black armoury. Sucks, I know. I had a full warlock set at one time, accidentally dismantled my boots -- when I came to this step I had to farm over 12 armour peices before I got boots again...
---
Aww anytime, I’m glad I did. Have a wonderful time :)
---
Should be on void with armamentarium n suppressor grenades n shoulder charge. Then you'd be god like 😉
---
Ya, found it out. Thanks for responding. I just can’t get the boots and when I transferred them they disappeared.
---
It would be insane if Bungie adds an ornament like that
---
Having an easy game removes the fun from it

---
Dude better not miss your Spanish lesson
---
Good meme
---
Don’t worry, were in the same boat.
---
This makes me wonder, what would be y’alls full exotic setup?
---
I did what gladd did but with bad juju, loaded question and wendigo 
---
If you saw his video of solo flawless then that’s what I did
---
&gt; I don't even play crucible
---
Well that explains your backwards mindset toward cheating. If you don't play it then how can you expect to have any perspective on the effects of cheating?
---
How would you feel if someone ruined an activity you actually cared about just for the sake of pissing you off or feeling superior to you?
---
There should be a new game mode where you can equip more than one exotic like a exotic mayhem
---
Last I checked, a masterworked weapon allows you to drop orbs on multikills. Guess I'm making more than just 2 extra per super. I play with a coordinated team, and hardly ever queue solo.
---
I saw that movie a zillion times when it came out. Love it.
---
Certain encounters can be done with only 1 person.  Though it will be incredibly difficult.  Only ones that come to mind that I've seen done is Kali (1st Encounter - Last Wish) and Riven (5th Encounter - Last Wish, also note this was done using and exploit that is no longer available).  Several other encounters are somewhat doable with only 2 players though.

Too late, theres already another exotic hand cannon coming out for shadowkeep.
---
How do you get to wear so many exotics?
---
Bruddah. Envy is the feeling of coveting something someone else has while jealousy is the feeling of fear that something/someone will be taken from you, like the fear of losing your bae to Chad etc.
---
IMO that synonym argument ain't it. Though I can see that definition working in some delicate situations, it still doesn't mean that jealousy = envy.  
---
But honestly I was just trying to crack a joke.
---
I see no good here, other than ME

If that includes the other Y2 DLC It's worth it.  If it's just Forsaken then its' not at any discount.  The 60 markdown is basically a marketing tactic because Y1 content is going to F2P or something like that.  That all sounds really negative but basically what I'm saying is I paid 40 bucks for Forsaken plus another whatever it was for the season pass.  So it may not be discounted but you aren't getting charged extra.  Forsaken is pretty beefy.
---
I know, but as far as delicate situations go, this is one of them.
---
How about an SMG version of Cerberus +1
---
is bungo ever gonna add class item exotics?
---
So your team mates were bad and you only played 4 stacks.
---
Nice setup ! And your cat looks strangely like hitler :0
---
Need Forsaken DLC.

As it stands it's actually possible to fully burst down the prime evil between invades.  Without the imminent threat of an invade it would be too easy to all-in and that's boring.
---
I think the most unbelievable part of that picture is that they have that much glimmer after moments of triumph released.
---
so basically i´m interested in playing forsaken, but that isn´t available anymore, they just sell a complete package instead, which seems like a cash grab to me. i was prepared to pay 15 bucks for forsaken, play that another month, and lay destiny back to rest. well, i can wait another year then :)

Mark isnt exotic. Downvote.

800,000 voices??? That must be an amazing gun

Its Mayhem week
---
Good job! Keep going!
---
Oh, that is unfortunate. Are they really hard to find?
---
I’d love the juju, and that red pulse from the WOTM raid... but the clanless grind.

Bro you’re only running one subclass?
