Normally wouldn't go for some Black Templar Armor but that's hot.  Blood Angels Titan Armor and now we're talking.

Once you hit max level your experience bar continues to fill.  When you hit a level again you get a bright engram.  The first 3 each week will come pretty quickly.  After that they kinda drag out.
---
You called?
---
You continue to gain levels after hitting the cap. Those levels give you a bright engram, one per level.
---
Levels after cap? Do tell
---
wanna trade?
---
One run, anarchy. Rngesus is fickle.
---
Under collections not the inventory
---
was it a helmet? if not and the armor view is focused on another item, its just preview characters they added into the game to let you view other classes armor.
---
Thx alot
---
Have him call it an Etruscan boar vessel

Sorry that‚Äôs a borderlands weapon

Good ol' Lord Fuckwad.

Well yes, but actually no

LoW is gonna be even better though?
---
Idiots who can't understand a lighthearted joke shouldn't be assholes in the internet in the first place!
---
Duke is my forever favorite gun in the game, I live for those sweet two-taps with rampage
---
My clan also refused gambit as an enjoyable pastime and complained the whole game. I just threw on some tunes and played away
---
Never.
---
This gun is basically krieg from bl2 and thats why i love it
---
Mayhem is by far my favorite game type, is it up right now? I thought it was something else.
---
Don't get me wrong, I want to to win too. But it mainly matters on Legend Rank where you need wins to progress you're rank. Any other time I don't usually care.
---
Great timing: somebody just posted this link analyzing PvE damage and DPS across weapon categories. Might help you decide what exactly to aim for once you're at the optimizing phase.
---
Its probably the Dreaming City armor while someone is as ascendant looks pretty cool
---
Is that a lunch box lmao
---
Yeah I was just as shocked lol
---
Lmao this is wild. Slowing it down, you see the shotty put in 4632 damage and then the melee crank out 44119. That combo is gnarly.
---
That sounds, fantastic!
---
Pretty sure said boss also dies to one or two cluster rockets
---
Warlock jumps are the best in my opinion if you know how to jump and don‚Äôt need to recover because you fell off something
---
I use burst always
---
Play Prime, dunno if they count but Prime almost guarantees an HVT if it goes long enough
---
Just be a little bitch like the top glory rating players and use a XIM
---
Awesome. Thank you for your input. You have been very helpful, as your name suggests. I will look into the annual pass once I'm in forsaken endgame.
---
A lot of people have this problem, but all with different gambit items. I doubt there's any sort of bug, just because it's a different item each time there is a post like this. Not getting a given item even after several resets' worth of gambit is by no means impossible or inconsistent with random drops, though it is very unlikely.
---
3 Hunters too, it‚Äôs almost as if they‚Äôre unbalanced
---
What‚Äôs the perks on that one
---
Go after good bone structure. Kill teh wanted witch in savathuns song.
---
You have to go to battle net and select destiny, options, and 'scan and repair.
---
See if it works.

That's honestly amazing.  If more assets and models became available to the community, we would be able to make so many more montages.
---
I never learned how to get to higher elevation with it. Do I just need to hit the button a second time faster?
---
I had one with rapid hit, and I much prefer outlaw
---
I'm pretty sure the only difference is the size. A goblet is sort of wine glass sized whereas a chalice is larger and more like a bowl on a stem. Realistically they're basically the same thing.

It'll actually be overall better with Release the Wolves changes
---
Hunter main here as well. My setup is almost always tether with orpheus rig, with outbreak, recluse, curated bellowing giant. Could also try a midnight coup, jotun, rocket launcher. Or another would be any pulse rifle (my favorite is a blast furnace rn) with ikelos and a boss melter (1kv/whisper).
---
 5 million scouts and rocket launchers later...
---
‚ÄúThe game chooses who wins and loses‚Äù because without it, everyone would ‚Äúchoose‚Äù to win.  Just because you try does not mean you get to win every time

Farming for good rolls on legendary weapons. Whenever I need to level up a character's power level I try to get as many powerful drops as possible and then infuse my favorite weapons for raiding and other end game activities. Just try to find weapons that you absolutely love to use.
---
It‚Äôs all about extending momentum. Once you wrap your head around that, the warlock jump makes more sense and is probably the most versatile jump in the game. 
---
To get height, you activate the glide at the start of your jump because that is when you are moving up fastest. It extends that initial momentum. 
---
If you wait, you don‚Äôt have as much upward momentum left so you don‚Äôt get as much.
---
As a hunter, I run Blade Barrage with the Shards exotic arms. Usually run Arbalest with the Black Armory Auto Rifle and a Hammerhead. Tend to win often, especially when invading.
---
Fuck you for making me giggle
---
Yeah they should obviously just buff the roaming add control sentinel supers to 1 hit kill mini boss level enemies
---
They need to just take 6 months away from nerfing and  buffing and instead of taking community complaints at face value...just play test every weapon, skill, armor, in all the game modes and see what works for what, and what changes really need to be made. Let them keep rolling out content, but I think a lot of players are getting worn down from all the changes that are always affecting how they play.
---
Instead of my clan talking about the Menagerie, they're still complaining about the Whisper nerf happening in a few days...I think that speaks volumes on what people are thinking about the most with the updates.
---
big gulp &gt; all other names
---
‚ù§Ô∏èThis is community right here. Some people just carry a sadness so heavy thay they can't hold it alone and want to push it on others but not one of those attacks hold true.
---
smh how rude
---
I don't get this.
---
It takes 5 seconds to check your stats and another 5 seconds to tell whether or not you're a cheater.
---
If you're pulling 99% accuracy in crucible, you're clearly a hacker.
---
When you say bungie made good nerfing choices for the next update.
---
I mean, now hear me out, could it be possible that due to triple infamy there are a lot more people playing Gambit so your exposure to negative players has a higher percentage chance?
---
need template
---
Is that ornament still available? I couldn't find it in tess inventory.
---
That's how it is. Sun, cup, dog, axes.
---
&gt;I respect people that can control 180
---
I don't mean to sound like an ass, but... it's perfectly fine if you can't control 180s, but... saying that you respect the people that can is kind of... weird, as they are ridiculously easy to control. Like... it doesn't make sense to me to say that... but anyway, no one asked for my opinion, so I'm just gonna shut up and let you be.
---
p.s: I'd suggest you practice a little with 180s. You may get really good with them and end up liking them. If you get good with the archetype, and you happen to get a god roll Service Revolver, you'll shred people in Crucible. Trust.
---
grenadier doom fang never loose your super for the entire run
---
Not just Enhancement cores, but Mod Components too!
---
Yea I‚Äôve been trying to get a good Service Revolver or Trust for aaaaaaages. But I say i respect them cos it‚Äôs something I can‚Äôt rly do. I got like 4 kills with Luna‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not used to 180, and usually use Midnight Coup or Duke Mk44. Crucible isn‚Äôt my usual mode, so me using 180s in PVE is cool
---
Can you explain how? I‚Äôm not quite sure as a titan myself
---

In EDZ when appears sometimes, that Vandal too. Cabal PE finishes, everyone tries to kill it, takes much longer than PE, Guardians all confused lol

Remember how randal could survive a few gjallarhorn shots

Going around with Antaeus Wards and Slideshot shotties in Crucible is just ridiculous üòÇ

I got my first full team wipe in comp the other day and I swear I screamed with him.

I have one that is pretty much the same except it has Demolitonist instead of One Two Punch, never have to reload üëåüèª
---
Man I didn't even get to use Phoenix protocol.
---
It‚Äôs super realistic so don‚Äôt blame BUNGIE. I have over 60 tier 3 clears on honestly only failed like 5 times and I‚Äôm not even a great player by any way shape or form. All you need is a tether hunter and a warlock running well. If you really had a coordinated team this would be very little challenge. Make sure to use the same type of weapon that the singe is that week. Also, roaming supers are terrible for reckoning bridge, one stomp and you team is sabotaged.

Yooooo,

‚ÄúI CAN FEEL THAT IN MY BONES!!!‚Äù
---
They're both broken
---
I didn't even knew people had problem with the warlock jump. My first character is a warlock and just now switched to titan. The warlock jump feels like a cheat with the amount of gliding you can get
---
Nova Warp got nerfed, and Spectral Blades got nerfed, I don‚Äôt see any problem here. 
---
Any Super/exotic gear that dominates PvP deserves to be nerfed to be in line with other supers/exotics.
---
Wait didn't he try to shoot our precious and the rounds just came back at him?
---
**God has joined server**
---
Only question is, why shoot 3 each when 1 is enough?
---
my point is that when they nerfed the two you mentioned during "arc week" dawnblade got buffed and titans and warlocks have run rampant with supers, but hunters are still getting complained about because they jump too fast...or there good movement.
---
Only one of those is flexible in PVP activity, and that's dawnblade. Top tree stormcaller only requires your team to not be a bunch of grouped up ding-dongs and it becomes moot. Alternatively,  handheld soup and contraverse isn't exactly *that* disgusting considering it's main effect apart from higher defense while slowly scuttling around with pocket grapes in your hand to throw at people's faces if you have the good fortune to catch them unaware around a corner is relying on RNG to hopefully give a third of your grenade energy back. Dawnblade is the only class that has a half a chance to hold up to the rigors of pvp, and it's damn near only for it's ult because floating around like warlocks do out of their ult in this game is basically a "Snipe me" sign lighting up over your head.
---
Ah grand, so there's no point trying to stack say 3 reserves hoping for a 30 round jotuun. 2 reserve, 1 scavenger and a heavy reserve would appear to be a decent mix then.
---
Im sorry but is captain America here?
---
Ok maybe not so unbreakable
---
Unfortunately, us titans are only useful for their melting point in raids. It‚Äôs sure helpful, but this can be replicated by shattering strike from a hunter without needing to wait for it to charge. Hunters have Orpheus rig tethers for tons of orbs and nighthawk for insane DPS. Warlocks have great ad clear with stormcaller, damage buff from wells, rifts, and melees, and dire ahamkara nova which is good for both ads and boss damage. Titans need some serious love from Bungie
---
Like everything in bungies games that belongs to someone in the next dlc
---
And *ahem* warlock‚Äôs middle tree melee
---
Switch gambit and crucible and you are correct.
---
I‚Äôm an asshole for asking a question?
---
Same thing we do with it.   
---
Punches all the way down.
---
Thanks bro
---
As a Titan that finally gets how Hunters jump, don't forget you can turn it off. A triple tap will do ya.  
---
Also rushes the double jump press, adding height.
---
Thanks man, appreciate it!
---
both can drop it, but Tier 2 is easier/faster and has fewer weapons that drop in it vs tier 3
---
If you try searching this subreddit, I can assure you that you will find a large amount of posts with your exact same question and plenty of long well thought out responses. This question is asked multiple times a day, so you will have no difficulty finding all the answers you could possibly want with just a search or two.

Good luck Guardian!

oh yea, i keep forgetting the opening cutscene, i also just watched the trailer thing
---
Read the rest of the thread
---
I feel like this would be one of those r/punpatrol moments when they would tell you to drop the pun and.putnypur hands up
---
I have all 3 characters. Titans are great in crucible. But hunters absolutely run gambit. Yes titans small barrier is perfect for boss melting and melting point is helpful. But tether hunters are IMO the best class for gambit. Or if your invader goldy gun hunters are king. Just to hard to beat in gambit. One thing that kills me is that in pvp I can survive a machine gun better than in gambit. I can get hit in thr tip of my foot with one hammhead bullet and they will kill me out of my thundercrash super.   There's something wrong with that.  So give me golden gun. Only thing that trumps those damned machine guns.
---
TIL Captain America was a victim of the collapse.
---
He could be any one of us !
---
Extremely. Before hand it had a total of 18 rounds and infinite ammo if you procted the perk. Then they shifted it to 9 rounds max plus the infinite rounds to make it less forgiving. Now its back to 18 rounds but White Nail (its exotic perk)  will no longer give ammo back but pulls it from reserves
---
Except Waverley Station is in Scotland, and we know the Cap was there when he rescued Vision and Scarlet Witch in Infinity War. So, he's been in Europe for sure. Not to mention he fought there a lot in WWII (though not with a round shield).
---
I still think we need a heavy slot hand cannon
---
YES!!!
---
i‚Äôve got an argument against that, but i wouldn‚Äôt want to spoil Endgame for anyone who might not have seen it yet, as i just watched it last night, so i know there are some people who probably haven‚Äôt seen it yet either
---
Its still going to be good.  Honestly getting 1/2 super from 4 red bars is pretty stupid.
---
Boost to 690 in an hour or so.

Alright, that's better. Thanks for that.
---
We have not time for petty squabbles, that is the Crucible's role. We need to focus on the next bug threat coming our way.

nah you gotta go for the cheese wheels
---
Yet again that video has nothing to do with what is being said here. Your unwillingness to actually back up what youre saying when confronted about it and defend yourself not only makes you look like an idiot to everybody here (hence why you are now getting more downvotes than me) but it also shows that*you* are in fact that one that is trolling. But what is the troll if theyre made to show their unintelligence? Well look in a mirror and I guess you'd find out.
---
Because lets be honest, you were wrong from the start. If you looked further in the thread, you would see that I wasnt saying a single thing about grammar or spelling yet you said I did. And when asked about it, you began scapegoating with links to unirrelevant posts and videos. And now anybody that looks at this is going to see me fully capable of defending myself while you can't even speak anything but made up points that you can't back. So while your ego will tell you youve won, anybody else looking will just see you backing down.
---
Okaaaay, this dumpster fire has burned long enough.
---
Hey buddy, i don‚Äôt think you know what gambit prime is about
---
Yup... Field prep gives me 2 extra reserve ammo and quicker handling while crouching or sliding so that's something lol
---
Ye what??? not like 90% of the Players who own pinnacle Weapons used asia server exploit to get them kekek
---
Hey BUDDY, I do know what it is, play it all the time, if you don't expect people to take motes, then play something else
---
This.
---
Out range it. It looses aim assist and has a steep damage drop off. Chaperone also is a good option if you can hot youre headshots. Alternatively you can remember the guys gt and if you see it in the bottom left dont push him dor a few seconds.
---
Thanks man, I posted this there and they liked it
---
Keep some distance, HCsm have more range than a recluse and also avoid that has MOA proced bc you will lose 9/10 times
---
There are pieces of armor for a reason. Normal gambit is for people who play without that armor. Gambit Prime is more competitive, devs even say that, pal
---
Heavyweight solar burn with spike grenade launcher, literally killed him before he could attack, didnt have to use an exotic or super
---
Well I‚Äôm not among those 90% cause I legitimately have no fucking clue about you‚Äôre talking about
---
This this the stupid shit I like to see
---
*pulse pistol
---
so you still expect people then to not take motes? not gonna happen mate
---
Now that would be a great idea if our knives were actually useful and didn't just tickle the bad guys. Maybe I should try and get Petra to teach me some knife tricks...
---
No way. That's awesome.easter egg perhaps ooorrr. I doubt they'd need permission to make a random shield with a star as it isn't an exact duplicate. I bet any money that one of the devs tossed it in there.
---
This is amazing! 
---
How much money do I have to convince my wife that I totally need for "Groceries" so I can own it
---
What's the location?
---
Did not see if it was posted but, where was this found exactly?
---
I got the same roll. Even better than trench barrel in the right situation. It hits like a truck
---
Lol, $650 might be a little hard to go under the radar. XD
---
Will it be worth it to use over another exotic? That remains to be seen; I'm not looking forward to the nerf. HOWEVER:
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Should you get it? Hell yes. The Whisper mission is one of the coolest pieces of Destiny content (if not THE coolest), so you owe it to yourself to play through it.
---
I think I used crimson - the three round burst drifts up so the final shot is (depending on aim) precision.

Oh, let me kiss your feet. Glad you spent that time getting that title.
---
The most fun match of Gambit I ever had was when people knew their role and place. That‚Äôs what was intended.
---
Yes
---
Thanks!
---
I feel ya. I just got my Ace yesterday. I used Service Revolver and Trust. But honestly, just use hand cannons you are comfortable with, stay back and don't rush and you'll get it in no time. Good luck, guardian
---
You might try r/fireteams, there's lots of LFG for PS4 on there. Also, if you're new to raiding you can always try r/DestinySherpa!
---
They also look like when you do the Hive Public Event on Titan.
---
What legendary kinetic sniper are you thinking has similar dps to whisper?  I‚Äôm genuinely curious.
---
That's what I thought. Anybody know if it's just Y1 Eververse or is it anything Y1?
---
I used Ikelos HC (because it seems super steady to me) and Crimson (for the reasons you said).
---
&gt;Hey leave the Warlocks alone not everyone can be as good as us hunters
---
This is why we Titans and the Hunters don't understand you.  
---
It's shit like this.
---
r/sneakycaptainamerica
---
It has to be at the start to work too forgot to mention. Also # makes font larger
---
It's how many times you ranked up with a character (unless that's what you meant), I definitely put way more than 64 tokens into him
---
Get on the power level bounties to get up to speed.  With the new season dropping in a couple of days, the new power level bounties will be for 690 gear. 
---
Hand cannons, pulse rifles, shotguns, and grenade launchers are still meta.
---
I‚Äôm not saying that a legendary will have the same dps. For example long shadow does descent dps and is kinetic. Leaving you with energy and exotic slots open
---
I‚Äôm not saying I don‚Äôt want one of a kind but I would like to see new armor tbh
---
Even if my PS4 is the primary? 
---
If not then damn, well thanks for the tip!
---
When older folks are talking about when they were children going to school, they might mention how they had to "walk barefoot in three feet of snow, up hill, both ways." It's exaggeration, inflating the difficulty of their personal experience, intending to convey the message that "you kids today have it easy".
---
Maybe not. I read somewhere that the quest and 690 gear was for everyone. I could be wrong. Guess we will find out tomorrow
---
1. You should buy Forsaken. It is worth the cost, though it comes with expansions 1 and 2 but it will cost the same even if you already own those. The annual pass is a bundle of three smaller end game DLCs (they only add end game activities, no campaigns or areas). It's not critical to have these, but if you want to play this game long term you should consider getting it when it next goes on sale. 
---
2. I've been playing since January 2018. If you don't own Forsaken, the game is the same, if not slightly worse. If you do own Forsaken, it's great! 
---
3. No one has any idea what will happen in August. All we know is that we should "tune in for the next chapter of D2" on Thursday. 
---
&gt; does this make the annual pass essentially useless since I missed the previous events?
---
I don't understand. Holiday events (example: Crimson Days, Dawning) are available to all players and occur every year on the holiday they are for. You could keep an eye on the Bungie website if you want to know when a holiday event is about to happen and when it ends, so you can play only during those times. 
---
Events have nothing to do with the annual pass.
---
Man I hit 2098 earlier this week myself, then went down to 1940. Hoping to get it tonight.
---
No br√∂ther, you may have N O  M √ñ A T S.
---
Not captured: me dying a few seconds later because I was still in awe, and those two being revived.
---
I can hear it right now.
---
That‚Äôs what was confusing me about the annual pass, it came off as seasonal content that is sort of dropped throughout the year. So I have access to all the content that‚Äôs been released in the annual pass? (I guess event was the wrong word to use)
---
This part is what affects those: 
---
&gt;Everyone's crucible and gambit ranks will be set to 0.
---
So for example, if you don't reset your gambit rank by Tuesday's reset, you will lose progress because your infamy will be set to 0. If you already reset your infamy rank, you don't have to do it again. 
---
Nothing about Oxygen will be affected. At least, in theory. If the past two seasons are anything to go by, there are always a lot of bugs when new parts of the annual pass release.
---
Yes, the annual pass is a bundle of DLCs releasing over the course of a year, at the start of each season. Like how DLC works for every video game, once you buy it, you have it, it doesn't get taken away arbitrarily, don't worry!
---
What have you done
---
Ah cool thanks for clearing that up!
---
Hahahahahahhahahahahha! Oh my fucking god! Bruh this is a fucking masterpiece!
---
Yeah that happens more times than you know

Yes, I did the malf and Thorn hand cannon parts if their quests with the ikelios hand cannon.  She's not bad. And I'm junk at PvP.
---
Deep down, with every part of my being, I pure out HATE YOU.
---
But goddamnit, do I respect you.
---
Depends how you use them. If you‚Äôre using them to kill adds, there should be a steady supply of primary ammo dropping. If you‚Äôre using them to deal boss damage, you might find yourself low on ammo occasionally. 
---
The only weapons that I‚Äôd use with primary ammo perks would be Sidearms, Weapons with Subsistence, and maybe Malfeasance.
---
r/fireteams not doing it for you?
---
I don't have any of those items....
---
Easier said than done. New tech for the next game will require old content to have to be retooled for it.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs why the title literally says ‚Äúthe place is  ridiculously dead‚Äù
---
I get that it shouldn‚Äôt be easy, but are all the steps after completing a mission to get it REALLY necessary?
---
Yes. I reset...some rank in crucible yesterday and got it, the chap quest. First part is annoying since you only get two slugs to start with. 
---
Some people have told me that the chaperone just randomly dropped for them.  Did it used to or are they talking out their asses?
---
Where is dis?
---
THIS IS WHAT THE KINDERGUARDIANS DRINK
---
I‚Äôm still confused by ‚Äúup hill both ways‚Äù. Is this supposed to be some sort of paradox joke?
---
I think your Destiny machine broke...
---
Whisper had higher dps during longer dps phases, being basically 9 seconds or longer whisper was better due to the rolling white nail.
---
Darci was better during short dps phases. It could get it's perk faster, better stability and iirc also fire rate.
---
However, now darci has a deeper pool of ammo, so while you can get more dos from whisper while both have ammo, you'll run out of ammo before darci with whisper because you're burning through it much faster since white nail reloads from reserves now.
---
I need to parse some info, but I think over the course of full heavy to empty that darci will do more damage, owed to larger capacity
---
So what you‚Äôre saying is: You want a specific armor set, but it‚Äôs locked behind RNG. But isn‚Äôt basically every armor set in the game locked behind RNG?
---
I did that on my warlock but it was incredibly hard being under leveled
---
I have no idea, I'm just tired of getting shit from him. I probably SHOULD be saving for mod components, but I like engrams too much.

I don't know if I want more *levels,* but I'd like more variety in the encounters, maybe rotating enemies or something (for different drops). I think EP1-7 is good enough for something that is semi-matchmade, but EP's real issue is that once you get the Ikelos drops, farming the shader (either because you think it's one of the best in the entire game, like I do, or because it's great for legendary shards) is basically all there is to do.
---
Story and do bounties for EVERYTHING. All the extras you pick up help a lot.
---
I noticed that a while ago, didn‚Äôt think much of it. As long as I get loot, it‚Äôs cool.
---
Ok so I just got Thorn, so I got the code to buy it and the shirt. On the website it says claim by the 4th or 5th this month. So does this mean that I can buy it whenever, now?   Or do I have to buy/pay for it by tomorrow?
---
And Savath√ªn‚Äôs Song
---
Ah ok
---
Regardless of that, you can't post here. This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 14.
---
Destiny 2 App?
---
"alright well just tell her I stopped by, ok!"
---
Been there, done that. Most fireteams end up abandoned or no one helps
---
Story and daliys and pick up bounties too
---
Just grab the Power Surge bounties from the Drifter.
---
In a very basic way yes, but the bright engrams are difficult to get(beyond three per a week) and then it‚Äôs still only a small(6% I think) chance to get the armor. Don‚Äôt even get me started with trying to get different perk rolls.
---
The sword is Worldline Zero. I like it. I haven‚Äôt got the sparrow yet.
---
Drifter has bounties that take you to 640. Tomorrow, they‚Äôll increase to 690.
---
It looks worth every penny.
---
She may notice the lack of food in the house though... Damn.
---
Raid launches on Wednesday where I live and it‚Äôs annoying as shit
---
Can I do them by myself
---
B√ñTHER I hunger for M √ñ A T S
---
There are some 640 light bounties that will give you a full set of armour and some weapons available from the drifter in the tower. He‚Äôs located in the annex will be on your map.
---
Although if you wait till tomorrow the Tuesday reset with the newest season launching you can boost right up to 690 and be ready for this season in no time ;). Hope this helps. All the bounties can be done solo, would be faster with a couple of players though, check the companion app always a bunch of people on there willing to help.
---
Gear list for those wondering! Shaders are in *italics* to make stuff a bit clearer:
---
**CLOAK**: NEOTERIC KIYOT CLOAK - *Forty-four Steel* (all three Hunters)
---
**HELMET**: CELESTIAL NIGHTHAWK - *Gambit Suede* (middle Hunter) / WING CONTENDER - *Crimson Valor* (left and right Hunters)
---
**ARMS**: IRON SYMMACHY GRIPS - *Precursor Vex Chrome* (middle and right Hunters) / LIAR'S HANDSHAKE \[+ornament\] - *Honors of the Nine* (left Hunter)
---
**CHEST**: NEOTERIC KIYOT VEST - *Precursor Vex* Chrome (all three Hunters)
---
**LEGS**: Prodigal Strides - *Precursor Vex Chrome* (left and middle Hunters) / Orpheus Rig \[no ornament\] - *Precursor Vex Chrome*
---
This is totally opposite everything the community says, everyone is always complaining it's too hard and needs to be easier
---
Easily, but wait till tommorow
---
Looks great but I have a few enginerd questions:
---
Is this ABS or PLA or another filament type?
---
Is this 100% solid or is there an infill percentage that you use to reduce material consumption and weight?
---
What software do you use to print?
---
It‚Äôs humorous, as it‚Äôs impossible, which might lead you to roll your eyes and say, ‚Äúyeah, *sure* gramps, times were tough in the sixties‚Äù
---
by clicking on the envelope above all the moderator names
---
They are talking about the melee ability 5 head
---
So Im at 700, the 690 stuff isn't gonna help me, but is it worthwhile to hang on to the gear and infuse it up to 700 with some 700 gear I have that I can part with?
---
Really curious about this gear, how the rolls and attributes will be. Some of the Revelry armor had some good rolls.
---
Ugh
---
How does this work? I only have 1 character. If I make characters later after i complete the quest can i still get 690 gear for them at that point?
---
What the fuck. What are the downvotes for? You were literally just making a joke.
---
If I do a raid will it scale up to my light
---
PLA
---
5% infill with 1.5mm walls (surprisingly strong)
---
Cura
---
I took tomorrow off. Gotta get that power leveling done. Go for the raid first week!
---
His picture is also in the ramen shop
---
You misspelled warlocks
---
Why are you the way that you are?
---
That‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs more of an unlikely wish than something that could happen but like a guy can hope right
---
Yes. But you can utilize xbox's built-in LFG tool. Just hit guide **&gt;** tab left twice **&gt;** select "looking for group" **&gt;** select "Destiny 2" **&gt;** search/browse, or create a post **&gt;** profit.
---
Reminds me on the D1 Purple LMG ‚ÄúZombie Apocalypse‚Äù but with a rusted bronze shader.
---
Alright thank you
---
That was my Reddit laugh for today.
---
If you get the 640 gear from the bounties (make sure your light goes as high as possible) it will a scale from there. Currently it will be scaling from your light level at the moment, if you want maximum gear potential in upgrades do the boost bounties first
---
Thank you.
---
Sleeper simulant?
---
NP, they are pretty basic stuff like "Do 2 Public Events and 3 bounties", but it can be more fun playing with others, and I see posts on the LFG tool pretty often from people just looking for company while they level up.
---
Also, just thought of it but try asking around, or checking r/fireteams to find a clan. You can get free gear and materials just by being a part of it, and you can get run through raids and stuff.
---
Ok I‚Äôll will try
---
Problem is I suck, I got one also, using it. Getting better at it a bit. Hopefully next season get it done since don't need to stress about reaching fabled for pinnacle weapon too.
---
#THANKS BUNGO
---
seems accurate :D I cri :( lol
---
^ This
---
Current power surge bounties drop blue rarity gear, since its sole purpose is to raise your power level, not to give you a set of armor to keep long term. 
---
All we know about the upcoming 690 power surge bounties is [in this TWAB (This Week at Bungie)](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47833)
---
&gt;Some of the Revelry armor had some good rolls.
---
All event armor so far has drawn from the exact same armor perk pool as the normal armor that always drops. It is different in appearance only.
---
I dont main titan but i really like top tree striker in PVE tbh
---
Its so you can get motes doing what you like to do. not taking roles you suck at. like a reaper invading all the time to build an invader set.
---
Honestly, not excited. Another recycled raid? At least use dreaming city, not leviathan for the 4th time... Screw this game. That season pass was a huge grindy ripoff.
---
Who wants to talk to people though
---
If they are doing this recycling D1 into D2 , Keep in mind the loot was lost and not destroyed then maybe it could mean D2 is adding D1 maps and stories to prepare for D3 in 2021?
---
Bruh the fact it takes place on levi does not make it recycled, levi is fucking massive
---
Pun patrol members I guess
---
I'm not saying that it was a problem either I'm just saying that I've seen this mentioned (or complained about) a lot on this sub but a few years ago it was just a normal thing. I wasn't trying to rip into your meme, my bad.
---
Telesto the Besto.
---
NO NEED MORE PUNCHES!
---
Thank you for this !
---
Hail Hydra
---
That actually hurt
---
Don‚Äôt think so mate, I believe it‚Äôs just new gear and stuff to do
---
No don‚Äôt apologize it was just a misunderstanding, no hate here my dude:)
---
If you didn't say Yeet calmly, ill be disappoint.
---
Pass. Fuck doing another leviathan raid. 1 was enough, 3 was pushing it. Fuck bungie.
---
I think we‚Äôll be seeing reprised Weapons from seasons 1-3, but probably just reprised Armor from season 1. The reason being that seasons 2 and 3 were only ornaments and more than likely, if Bungie‚Äôs bringing back the original armor the ornaments will still be applicable.
---
Would a be a nice tip of the hat to Curse and Warmind players.
---
But they might also bring back the ornaments which would be big dum
---
Am I the only one that likes getting the fresh starts?
---
Sentinels and their "impregnable defense", right?
---
"Guess I'm sucking dick from now on"

Hi sucking dick from now on", I'm dad.

I got Fourth Time's a Charm with rampage, good enough for me...I just need a better bug-out bag

Still trying to farm a Gnawing Hunger. I've gotten at least 4-5 of every other weapon. Dumb.

A hospital never stops running....turns out people die when you do that. So I'm stuck till evening. Even worse I just had a 3 day weekend and won't get a day off till next Monday, so I won't be able to fully enjoy it.

This really is a viable rat king effectively
---
Ditch the scout and use a shoty
---
His cloak is hanging the the left of Holliday
---
Exactly
---
Hunter, BB, shards for that third round clutch. Malfeasance, Recluse, Hammerhead. With taken armament mod you'll always have heavy ammo. Great all around setup against invaders, mobs, blockers and also for invading.
---
Except for against AI. It‚Äôs annoying. Started as a Titan long ago. Played my Titan for the first time this season three days ago. Hunters are just too much fun! Really squishy though. Why can‚Äôt armor have two or three mod slots of you get it from endgame content!? Super mod, resilience mod, recovery mod on every piece of armor.
---
Oh ok thanks for the clarification. I have some revelry boots with traction on them (hunter) that I like. I've only gotten traction on the 5t0mp33s. I thought they were special üòÇ
---
You really know your stuff, thanks!

You can join mine: Kickin Chickin!

Where?

Oooo mami u sxc

this happens to me in quickplay, also I'm really disappointed mayhem wasn't on during the revelry. That would have been absolute chaos.

Season of Flaccidlance?

Why my Orpheus Rig getting neutered

Good times man üò™

This is AWSOME. I just wonder why Osiris is so ugly without helmet :D

I WAS WRONG ABOUT DEVOUR
---
We'll never know
---
Better learn to use your feet
---
true love.
---
fresh starts are fine, but all of the stuff from old games should be in the new ones. at least exotics, maps, strikes, cosmetics, and raids.
---
I understood that reference
---
Why does that guy have that many keys?
---
Phones are hard
---
Damn that's a sweet pic.  I thought it was Rain from MK as a Destiny character at first, since the Osiris DLC was so forgettable.
---
This has been a persistent bug for a very long time. The way to fix it is to complete the campaign. Your reward engram will then be claim-able.
---
Can only get it from shaxx
---
Had to switch to lobbing hammers since I thought tossing shields would guarantee coming back... At least hammers are cheaper to toss away, amiright?
---
10/10 good shit fam.  You never ceases to impress.
---
Yes this stuff is per character not account. They did the same thing with season of the drifter. You‚Äôll have to progress your alt through the campaigns like normal but when your character reaches this point in the game the mission should be available. I will say that leveling alts is way faster than leveling your main so you probably won‚Äôt need it. When your alt get to level 50 just throw your max power guns on from your main and you‚Äôll catch up very quick.

WE ARE THE TITAN CREW!

AND HERE IS WHAT WE DO!

WE SMASH AND CRASH AND TRASH AND GASH UNTIL THE DAY IS THROUGH~

really? thats what you're asking about?
---
I hunger for **_L √ñ √ñ T._**
---
 Nah it‚Äôs just the model, it‚Äôs most likely the raid weapon set like the machine gun posted earlier with the hive carvings
---
Hey, I see your work on Instagram all the time! Love your stuff, keep it up

Smells like a filthy hunter main

Chieftan America

Ayyy now You're 15 votes positive!

Yes because asking about the three guns would‚Äôve been obvious
---
Trust. Trust me.

(Gambit weapon)
---
I believe Shaxx is on the farm and his rank up packages work, this looks like the gunsmith.
---
thats fair
---
ME A PUNCHER TOO! IT GOOD TO FIND MAN OF MANY PUNCHES AND DRINKS LIKE ME!
---
Always picking up after you boys
---
Could you make this phone wallpaper, like how much. Pls
---
Except if you read the lore the drifter works with the vanguard, they just kept aunor out of the loop
---
Seriously I will never understand all the Warlock jump hating, I main warlock and then I play one of the other classes and I can‚Äôt fucking stand it, the other jumps are so slow and short compared to warlock jump, it just takes skill to use but when you learn how it‚Äôs the best jump in the game
---
I understand that reference

Nvm I have autism and don't use mobile much
