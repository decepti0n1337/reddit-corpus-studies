I would say EoW is the easiest, the least mechanic raid of the group and short.
---
---
---
Thanks man, ive sorted out my mic now and yes, I will look it up online. What I went through last night with the team saying such things almost put me off raids - it was tough.
---
Different rule set. r/DTG doesn't allow link posts at all, so no memes. That and this is a smaller subreddit, so there's less salt by proxy. Something I've seen a lot on DTG is that the r/Destiny2 people are so happy because they aren't from D1 and don't know what they lost, which doesn't seem true at all.
---

---
IMO, it's because of the ack of memes, and the enforced seriousness a lot of the posts have that bring salt. This sub has 0 backseat dev posts.
---
This is definitely the better sub in that case
---
Claptrap?
---
I fear no man. But that thing, it scares me...
---
I don't even need to tell you why this was removed.
---
For Lunas: Target Adjuster or Icarus Grip
---
For Recluse: Counterbalance Stock or Freehand Grip, I guess? Counterbalance just seems to be the go to for every SMG on console. If you're on PC, I guess you could use Icarus as well to kill *all* spread on the weapon.
---
Didnt realize stronghold buffed sword damage.
---
You‚Äôre straight bootus if you think that‚Äôs a good idea
---
Hahahaha
---
Quickplay is so much sweatier than comp
---
Sadly my economically challenged friend doesn't own forsaken
---
Shit. I just tried it on a different one and the difference is ridiculous. Sorry for the misleading title.
---
It doesn‚Äôt afaik. This boss is ez pz
---
I'll make a capture of it and upload as soon as I get the chance when the 3x hits.
---
If you hold them over, the Drifter should have a full board of bounties for you to pick up if that's what you mean.
---
Like D1. If the same one is offered again after reset, then you can‚Äôt pick it up.
---
Yea, I even had to do some cruciblwle ones and I suck at PVP. Took a while to get two rapid multi-kills.
---
Good lookin' out, I'll be careful!
---
Yes sir. Rank for gambit and crucible is account wide.
---
I like Gambit, Prime, and Reckoning a lot actually, but I have gotten a little burnt out. Gotta get that third reset for the ghost/Dredgen, but then I'm ready for a little break.
---
I used it for the first week it was out then put it away. I equipped it again last month for the hell of it and haven‚Äôt put it down since. Now every hand cannon feels so slow. 
---
I feel like the service revolver isn‚Äôt great. Trust feels much better.
---
In a really close game there is a 3-5 sec window after the timer runs out for you to score more points. If it's 99-100 and it ends but I get 2 kills as time runs out score can jump to 101-100 and my team will win.
---
Legend has it that those two guardians are still there to this day.

Oh yes a clip with actual tatic and prediction in it, instead of just some snipe montage.

It‚Äôs all good, opinions are opinions

Redrix broadsword
---
lmao - the penumbra gsm - green GL is really goods for dps
---
The problem with Whisper is it had infinite ammo. So many raids were made easy as hell thanks to it. 
---
Plus with Phoenix, if you fought well you could use Well of Radiance indefinitely. 
---
They want raids to be hard, and people to rely on each other.
---
Never cared for 180 rpm handcannons so I might actually try getting the quest steps done before the season ends since I already got fabled.
---
Rifles barrel and full choke are on par with one another as of this time.
---
You can literally look it up on destiny tracker it is the second highest gun behind dust rock blues. I dont even use the gun it just dumb to try and piss people off by stating something that is not true. Bungie made a gun that was over powered a lot of people started relying on that gun over the past 9 months so bungie is trying to slightly change the meta.
---
what has crucible to do with the eververse? and why the hell do you complain about pvp exotics forcing you to play pvp? it‚Äòs bot that we pvp players complain about grinding our pve stuff in pve... destiny is a PVP and PVE game at once and it‚Äòs good that way. I know that people like you would abandon crucibe if you wrre the ones to decide but there are actually people enjoying both. You need to understand that pvp isn‚Äòt pve and you need to adapt to win. then it‚Äòs easy
---
Meh, falling from like 5 centimeters instantly kills me and that rhino just goes on with his business.
---
Destiny 2 and Forsaken come on sale every once in a while, but I don't think it will be happening again anytime soon. Forsaken was one of the best dlcs and I 100% recommend getting it. The annual pass is worth the money and its a good way to keep busy once you're a higher level and need more endgame content. 
---
You'll get a lot of mixed emotions about the game, but it is definitely fun to play and worth the money. If you can get the annual pass I would, but forsaken is a must for the story and leveling.
---
Retold tale is a precision frame.
---
*screams in dredgen*
---
I‚Äôve never actually used tractor cannon but it looks like so much fun, I wanna run around in crucible with it. If only it didn‚Äôt take heavy I‚Äôd just run around booping everyone alllllll the time.
---
Absolutely, it‚Äôs why I‚Äôve never been much for the shotgun life, I‚Äôm all about the snipes. Shotgunning doesn‚Äôt give me the satisfaction that sniping does.
---
I love it more when you die on the last ledge in the 'shattered throne' and someone revives you, you revive over the ledge and fall to your death
---
A true tank class, very impressed with those tanking skills bro. Way to take all the heat for the team brudda.
---
Why would it be trash in pve??
---
Still, not worth the heavy and exotic slot. That it created ammo out of thin air, was the reason people used it. I doubt i'll see anyone with it after June 4th.
---
Yea I think it should be possible, you might try to do an LFG and get a pre-made fireteam to knock out some wins, and make sure to grab the bounties. I got from about 7,000 to 14,000 this past week and I didn't even turn any bounties in and just played with matchmade randoms. Good luck to you man!
---
Sorry I've already had someone message me about it
---
Yea just follow teammates and team shoot the enemy. You'll survive longer and do the quest step way faster
---
Whisper and Acrius are very worth it, especially since the Whisper mission is easy
---
Oh i think im too late :D
---
I'll check out probably.
---
I have a question tho. Did you make the description in Polish yourself or is it an Googles doing? Coz there's one line in Polish and it sucks. The first in the "about" block.
---
"Tw√≥j towarzysz podr√≥≈ºy kosmicznych i wszƒôdzie

Little Light is an item manager for Destiny 2 that will make your guardian's life a lot easier."
---
It is like "Your space travel companion and everywhere". Dunno. Maybe I'm overthinking...
---
How are you charging your dodge so fast!
---
r/mypeopleneedme
---
What am i missing here?
---
It was during the revelry, and in order to survive against skip grenades, I chose to buff dodge
---
Wow this pretty much sums it up for me then. I have to give it a shot now. Thanks for your help man.
---
I will be playing on pc
---
lol it's probably auto translated, but it was translated exactly like I did in english  
---
"Your space travel companion, anywhere"
---
yeah i suck at writing stuff üòÖ
---
Less people. Thats really all there is too it.
---
People who dislike somthing tend to be very loud about it which in turn pushes away people who turned up to enjoy a game bit like a asshole at a party who kills the whole vibe of a room. 
---
So more people more vibe killing idiots turn up.
---
This is why certain nightclubs have bouncers who decided who is let in even if its massive place. if you want a real world example

I got Destiny 1 on release. Played it for a few days and stopped. It wasn‚Äôt really my thing. Then I went back after the Taken King and kinda liked it but it was a little bit too late. I didn‚Äôt get Destiny 2 on release day (probably a good thing) I got the Forsaken pack (the one that includes everything, including the annual pass) on December last year when I was on break. Instantly got hooked, so so hooked. I loved it. I played it so much, I leveled up two characters in a couple of days (lvl 50) I stopped for a while because I got busy, but got back again recently and oh it‚Äôs such a blast, there‚Äôs so much content it‚Äôs crazy. There‚Äôs always something to do. Even after you finish all your weeklys and dailys you can still chase those god rolls and pinnacle weapons. I‚Äôd say yes. It is worth a comeback. The new DLC comes out on June 4th, it‚Äôll have a new Raid, some sandbox changes and new gear/weapons etc, get the package that includes everything and you don‚Äôt have to worry about anything else.
---
That‚Äôs not hawkmoon, hawkmoon doesn‚Äôt have the two circles on the side like that. But truth is definitely coming back

OOOOOOOOH

*‚ÄùIf you‚Äôre in Europe...‚Äù*

FUCK
---
If you do not get past the step asking you to reach fabled within the season that you reach fabled, you have to reach fabled again next season. 
---
The triumph is only for Recluse.
---
Ah, gotcha. Thank you!
---
i know hawkmoon was said to be leaked but the gun in the trailer has the exact same theme as most of the other guns they showed, so unless theres an ornament that just straight up makes it look like a basic legendary i have to disagree. i would love to be wrong though. i just dont see bungie removing the iconic talon on the bottom of the grip to make it look like all the other season of opulence guns
---
Which is why it takes heavy.
---
Bad bait, bro.
---
Well it has the barrel and the little thing under the barrel.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs an ornament?
---
Of course you'll have to hit fabled again) But you have 7 days and nights still^^
---
Can I say that at least I love the BA aesthetics? 
---
There isn't a single BA gun that I won't use just because I can't stand the way it looks or it's  animations.
---
I think it's just the hand canon of the new set, looks similar in design (with the purple gems) to a SMG shown earily in the video
---
It is and should be done in maybe the beginning of a season due to the 5 resets if you're a passive player. I got mine recently on console and I love it.
---

---
And Erentil being charged around corners.
---
With the Annual Pass, you have access to power surge bounties that will boost you to 640 very quickly. I believe there's more coming next week that will boost you to 690.
---
Whether it's worth it or not is a debate, some people feel one way, others feel differently. I haven't regretted my purchase thus far other than being very disappointed with the coming nerfs to favorite gear.
---
Looks pretty good
---
Lmao
---
I've never seen Enemy of my Enemy in the heroic story mission rotation. I've never seen any of the world quests there. I suppose it's possible I managed to miss every single time it was in the rotation over the past year and a half. It is a series of three quests, it's not just one, so I am not sure how that would work. 
---
To be clear, you do mean the heroic story mission playlist under the vanguard icon on the director, right? Not the heroic adventure playlist on the flashpoint planet? I had thought world quests were considered their own thing and never appeared in either one. I am sorry, but I have a hard time believing that you had a world quest, *not* a campaign mission, in the heroic campaign mission playlist. 
---
I can say for 100% certain that you don't have to let Mithrax live in order to get the door to unlock. It's not only because that is how it worked for me, I talked to a lot of players when trying to figure out how this new quest worked.
---
Wuuuuuuhhh man
---
No
---
nope, cant transfer items between the two games at all
---
A dude at work has this and I didn't know what it was until now kinda jealous
---
That did it...ty so much for the help
---
Yeah, that lasts way too long. I wouldnt boast about getting kills when it's clearly overpowered.
---
Are you dense mate? Even if somehow what you're showing is legit lunas is not really effected by bloom AT ALL. And also you realise bloom doesn't exist If you aren't firing the weapon. The bloom is tied to the recoil
---
That's not how it works. That's not how any of this works.
---
Just hit the reply button directly underneath the comment you are wishing to reply to ;)
---
As a Hunter, I once intended to switch to Tether for the strike, but realized all too late that I had Spectral Blades equipped, so I decided fuck it and tried to get out to Xol with it. 
---
Went about as well as you‚Äôd expect.
---
Hulk, for one in your life, DON'T LOOT!
---
We are going to deploy the update at 8AM Pacific and the game will be down until 10AM Pacific, so that as many players as possible can get through the download and verification step and be ready for Opulence launch.
---
Wow, I'm so done with this game.
---
I got curious after watching the trailer and clicked on the link in the description.
---
All that was going through my head was "please tell me they added a new bow" and as luck would have it, they did!
---
I was hoping that we'd get an exotic recurve bow (or legendary longbow) but I won't complain.
---
Here's the link.
---
https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47840
---
The bow looks sick! Any more info on it?
---
Nope D1 is D1 and D2 is D2. No crossovers.
---
It is S-tier on PC.
---
Yeah I made my account during the beta for anthem, when the game was actually good, and now regret it
---
I'm sorry, there's nothing I can really say besides, just play? Like I said, most items in this game are random drops. Until you reach power level 500, any loot will help increase your power level. After 500, you have to do activities that list "powerful gear" as the reward in order to further increase in power.
---
You do realize that this is only a fraction of the new content coming out next week right?
---
 precision hit from hip fire drastically reduce draw time
---
It worked thank u so much
---
Every xbox player I know uses the xbox built-in LFG tool exclusively, so you might not see a lot of other xbox users on the app or r/fireteams. If the xbox LFG tool or the app doesn't work for you, you might try r/DestinySherpa if you can't find someone that already has Rat King to run you through it.
---
You can always add me (gamertag is the same as my username) and if you see me login shoot me an invite. I'll run you through it real quick.
---
You are correct, so I am not sure why you were downvoted. 
---
If it's not powerful, it turns back into modulus reports.
---
Precision kills vastly increase draw speed. Personally, I love it already
---
Trust is a gambit hc which can be great
---
titans have always been broken, just accept you use an op fast charging one hit melee class.
---
I used to use Little Light, but abandoned it for the speed of The Vault, and I'll offer use DIM in Chre while I'm playing.
---
I'll give it a go today and let you know what I think.
---
Weg gone loes
---
This clip made me pissed af
---
What element is hush?
---
You hella dumb. Luna‚Äôs has no bloom. You think we wouldn‚Äôt notice the magazine size staying the same with you slightly pulling the trigger?
---
service revolver is good, its a random drop from the vanguard (zavala) and once you do several strikes you can just buy one form him. its not the best roll but its a 180 hand cannon that real nice
---
Hope I don't need to get to 3000 glory, jump off a cliff, kiss Shaxx (not opposed) and delete all my guns in storage to get the sniper. Looks pretty dope.
---
I want the TRUTH!
---
Pc player here:
---
What is this copying bug I've been hearing about for ps4 players?
---
The Last Word?
---
Have it.
---
Which one? Spiteful fang or No Turning Back?
---
First of all WHY IS YOU USING LEGEND OF ARUCIS ON XOL
---
Laziness. I was used to the D2 app. I've considered using the lfg tool many times, though.
---
I was thinking of no turning back but I forgot about the Spiteful
---
we're really not
---
no idea
---
Exact same thing is happening to me
---
Snipers aren't that bad on PC, they're super vulnerable to aim punch and suck at anything but long range.
---
Shotguns ^^^^^^^^crutches on the other hand...
---
So which one don‚Äôt you have then from this list?[Exotic Kinetics](https://imgur.com/gallery/zKmKNlg)

We lost by 3

Thanks man üëå

Nvidia's Shadowplay can be set up to always be recording the last x minutes. Same as the Windows Game Bar really, but a bit more lowlevel.
---
Go through the comments they answered my question
---
Goddamn that super is *long*
---
Sorry here you go! [Warlock Forsaken Exotics](https://imgur.com/gallery/nL5q2DT)
---
Well it‚Äôs not really a bug, it‚Äôs a fucked up feature that when you update any game after its downloaded, the ps4 has to make a clone of the whole file to apply the update. So you need double the space of whatever the game is. And it just takes forever for large games.
---
Well then either i get really unlucky or snipers are better than they sound cuz all people with snipers i see give about as many damns about flinch as a warlock does about gravity
---
Burden and arbalest. I‚Äôm thinking its burden even though I think that‚Äôs technically part of black armory.
---
Edit: I think it‚Äôs 1k voices.
---
One of the few crutch guns of the crucible I would prefer to see put back to the power slot.
---
I would have loved to see a +movement speed perk after a precision kill on a pinnacle sniper.  The pairing with recluse would have been very nice.
---
Idk you can just tell when something in this game doesn't seem right. He should've ran out of his super after he killed the second guy on b flag. The only thing they weren't prepared for was him still having his super.
---
Thousand voices! That might actually be it.
---
Why would the system need to clone the entire game? That would make a big game like Doom take forever to update
---
Gotta call bungie support my buddy had the same problem pain in the ass but good luck.
---
Yep.  He was also in Final Fantasy 12 as Balthier.  Along with [a lot of games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideon_Emery#Video_games)
---
There you go!! You would have been missing it from your other characters as well. If you have other characters.
---
Yes, it was changed a few months back to be available 24/7 any time there is a public event in the right spot. 
---
You cannot enter heroic Whisper if you haven't completed normal Whisper.
---
Damn you can‚Äôt charge back at all?
---
Sniper perk is novel, but there are already some insane snipes in the game that it doesn‚Äôt make the comp grind worth it. Gambit bow has a cool perk but idk about you but I mainly ads with bows so idk how often I would be using the perk. And the grenade launcher is strange and seems situational? They just don‚Äôt seem worth the grind at all.
---
Why not? Some guns were way too fun to lose.
---
That would be neat too.
---
Lol
---
Yeah, the only weapon worth the grind for comp is recluse. Also it cant compete against ikelos or recluse in pve
---
How do I do that sorry for my ignorance
---
Not gonna lie, all of these kinda suck
---
Oh it is by no means going to be anywhere near meta, or at least I dont think so, I just think it will be fun to mess around with.
---
That looks like a short zoom sniper with a decent perk, so I wouldn't count it out
---
Contact your bank or PayPal and tell them it was a scam and you didn‚Äôt get what you payed for.
---
imagine putting down a well and go to town with wendigo on riven
---
PVP pinnacle is as strong as ever
---
and...we finally got a not top tier gambit weapon
---
Farm heavy. Preferably meta toxic weapons. When you see a super pop, panic super them with whatever you can. Go fucking bonkers, yeah?
---
Thanks! Hoping to get them before end of the season!
