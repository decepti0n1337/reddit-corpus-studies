Congrats guardian.

Now ask your self DID YOU THROW ALL THE GRENADES YOU COULd

F
---
Got to love it when it all comes together!!!
---
More funny enought i was also doing a kindel frame at the 2nd time i Got it and the handcannon is also a godroll i think (dropmag, rampage and sourounded) so..... üòù
---
Destiny is basically the World of Warcraft of looter shooters. People always say it's gonna be killed, and then it isn't. The only thing that's gonna kill it is itself.
---
Only right now WoW is killing itself while Destiny is at its peak. 
---
But I have unlimited lifes I dont need a helmet.
---
Are you trying to be funny?
---
Working as intended.
---
Yup. I had one with 14, 3 blockers then the invader came... I killed them ALL and he proceeded to fall off the edge and die anyway. 
---
What‚Äôs your points at now? If you‚Äôre just starting, I would just go for it next season. 
---
Since you gain valor no matter what, even on a loss, ‚Äúlegend‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really reflect skill. So yeah you may just be playing with a different crowd than you‚Äôre used to
---
Im almost at fabled doing the same thing. What i did was work on lunas until i got to the last step and then started using a blast furnace/bygones to start with redrix. I did this because lunas is more difficult to get some of these steps done where as i feel like redrix is more about patience then anything else.
---
Outstanding.... PHENOMENAL... 
---
#SEVENTHCOLUMN 
---
Nifty. Guess I never ran across him randomly since I play mostly during the week. Good to note, will pay them a visit 
---
They're just not using supers to invade for me. I have no issue killing them :/
---
its just storage dont question it and dont look around its absolutely nothing
---
Dude no one can read that 240p shit. 
---
The aim assist is getting fixed to slightly less than it was originally supposed to be which is much less than now 
---
Yeah, I cant imagine having to grind it (I started literally the last day the quest was still handed out).
---
Tastes like.....watermelon lightning...with a tad of blue Gatorade..

My man, have you *heard* the theme for Jungle Fury? 
---
Trust, Duke Mk. 44, and even the good ol' Better Devils. 
---
First time?
---
Is that the one that‚Äôs like ‚Äúhere comes the power rangers, jungle fury‚Äù
---
people got bounties to clear. seriously, that send 1 small/medium/large blocker bounty is a pain in the ass when everyone tries to clear it at the same time.
---
I figured out on my first run that it was the chest in a dark corner because everyone was ignoring it and no one went near it so it had to be that one based on plot-armor logic. 
---
I tested a lot of them but ended up doing with Trust, Better Devils and Forged one from black armory ...its up to you,l basically as its whats better for me could be worst thing for you
---
Uh have you tried that with an auto rifle yet I still don't have the damn chest peice and I got a mighty need to pair it with break neck I'm sure it will be beautiful lol
---
see you on the r/all

I'd be using the Ace of spades ALOT more

Trail?
---
I've tried it with my Tigerspite because its the best auto the game has felt like giving me. I was not a fan I don't really like auto though. Can confirm it's awesome with hand cannons and pulses.
---
Next week*
---
Wrong I‚Äôm looking forward to getting geo mags. Thanks Xur!
---
HA sir have you seen quick play in the crucible.. XD
---
???? That doesn‚Äôt make him any better. After you have them all he serves no purpose.
---
Wtf is ur character with such yellow ass makeup XD
---
Made with memeatic
---
&gt;Gambit with randoms sucks. 
---
Putting together a fireteam of 4 doesn't suck. There are lots of ways to LFG. 
---
Your fire team of 2 gets added to a guy trying pitifully to solo it with 6 seconds left once you finally load in.
---
Ok thanks just need it to drop for me lol
---
How did you get this screenshot?
---
This is the first one of these charts I have ever seen that actually makes sense to me. I finally understand what all this means
---
I think cayde patrol quests - ikora story quests were removed after forsaken released
---
I hear ya man, I just reset for the first time lol. Still 2 to go for the title, not grinding it more this season. Too irritating with randoms. 
---
Yes but now, he does have purpose since I don‚Äôt have them all. Therefore not stale
---
Inspect a shader, it will change the look of your whole character, including exotics. (Sadly only primaries)
---
Is there a version of this for phone backgrounds??
---
Can‚Äôt wait for Gambit entirely to be ruined, just like how the crucible turned out.
---
The hallowed lair strike when it‚Äôs a nightfall.
---
[removed]
---
it was just a snarky comment. nothing funny about it
---
being in it for himself is chaotic neutral to a T though. Good placement imo on this.
---
I don't get how people pull this off. How tf dis he know to trigger his super before any enemies even came into sight? How tf do ppl know where people are going to be with such accuracy in crucible games?
---
Me too hand cannons are my life
---
Finnaly got mine from a blind well it was queenbreaker love the thing
---
I saw them capping c so I have it a SHOT.
---
That‚Äôs when the purple guns come in 
---
How does it perform vs Sweet Business? I really like it, and I'm thinking of switching to Breakneck, but it'd be nice to have another opinion.
---
Oh my god thank you, didn‚Äôt know

woops lol, but yeah just use the site to mess around with that. I thought I had changed it back to triple tap my bad.

We hate you.

Sincerely, with disgust,

I get that a lot with my clips.

Counterintuitive, better hope the bullet kills instead of the explosion, no Dragonfly otherwise
---
I am a Guardian. My duty is to protect the last safe city and its people. I represent the light. I will forever walk in the light. No matter how bad I want....Thorn...the fun of guns...I walk with the light and I stand with the Vanguard. Even if Zavala is a stubborn bald headed lil bitch sometimes.
---
Hive on the field, bring a sword!
---
Well seeing that it lasted longer than the worm husk did we k ow it was getting a nerf sooner or later, like come on, taps titan then dies. Titan with full health and shields, come on that is kinda broken, lol
---
Damn I‚Äôd like to play against that team!
---
So, he‚Äôs putting on big screen.. honestly tho... fuck itI should not be a slower movement speedgood bot The league says every offseason illegal screens will be at least in the military.

hand cannons are the face of the game
---
r/raidsecrets
---
I personally prefer handcannons, so I love it. But, I wouldn't be opposed to finding out Rose is actually an SMG (like an Uzi). 
---
I was given autism aswell
---
They have to make money somehow, even more so now that they dont have backing from Activisions deep pockets.
---
I'm sitting here dying for one or two exotic pulse rifles. 
---
Yeah i noticed those when I was doing research about this the other day... the thumbsticks on those gamepads aren't actually analog are they? Like they only have 8 different directions you can point them, and you can't push any directly lightly rather than all the way? Am I correct in that?
---
If the exotic is inside the goblin and killing it dropped a yellow, wouldn‚Äôt it make sense to kill all of Vex for a better chance at getting another?
---
Yeah man he needs to grow some hair
---
Seriously. I'll upvote and comment every time I see these threads.

It's been too long. Just flip the switch or whatever already bungie. Don't be a dick.

All of them I say, ALL OF THEM!

I mean like, there are hundreds of slayers of oryx
---
Nope, that one vex was nice enough to give me a piece offering, now I‚Äôll take it and make sure that no other goblin shall die by my hands.  I may appear as a bad teammate in most strikes, but that‚Äôs ok.  It‚Äôs for the cause!! Plus, I‚Äôve got all that I want now.
---
I intend to follow the true leader of the titans. Where shaxx goes so do I.

Purple calus

How do I translate what he's doing into Synapse? 
---
We violently murdered thousands and we're good, right?
---
Even then I go for heroic. You still get rewarded if you aren't strong enough and fail...and I've had a lot of events where I was the only one, then suddenly there were 4 people helping by the end. Especially on Tangled Shore where a lot of people are trying to farm fragments for Wanted bounties.
---
If you make it heroic, they will come.
---
??
---
Hello! Been a long time!
---
Calus hit you with the Martyrdom
---
I hear the catalyst let‚Äôs you write in cursive. 
---
GG is a very good super in the right hands, in PC it's very popular because you can worldline tp and super (also possible on console) for some very cheeky kills. Along with PC having more freedom over mouse movement allows it to be a perfect shutdown super if you need to quickly flick onto a super.
---
That's usually a Chaotic Neutral's bottom line, ya know.
---
That‚Äôs like saying double kills is bad because it makes other people group up
---
But it‚Äôs random tho
---
Whoops, thank you! 
---
Yep no problem lol the other one linked to a dead oneüòÇüòÇ im gonna delete the comment now
---
Correct, it's just on or off. Or in my case I nudge the stick by accident and end up with wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww in my text windows haha
---
Not having a console, I never really noticed, but I could see how that might frustrate somebody used to having that finesse. Plus I initially got it for WoW where there's only one speed anyway.
---
They can but only for crucible augmented frames. 
---
Currently on 4/10 and I have killed 3 invading sunbreakers in their super this week (jotun/chaos super) none counted for the triumph. 
---

I thought I was the only one
---
Like 3 weeks ago Vigilance Wing was for sale, was a pretty good buy. I'm still waiting for some St0mp-ee5, though.
---
Why does everyone say they are getting nerfed? The damage is going to be transferred from the clusters to the main projectile to make them more consistent, if that makes them ultimately useless than I can see that, but we dont know if they will be actually worse now or if they are still gonna pump out the numbers.
---
I'd think I would be more happy bout those 2 engrams bro
---
That lack of awareness tho
---
I thoroughly enjoy both games, though anthem is still going through Y1 issues, I don't have it in me to go through that again unfortunately. I do find they play entirely different though, literally nothing feels to same about them. 
---
OP likes vex jizz 
---
Just got one doing my strike bounties. I always seem to get it by doing strikes.

Or at least have different dialogue option through settings and base it on a list of ESRB ratings

Mature (M) - Angry Russian intensifies

God I miss old titan armor
---
Chaotic Evil should be Savathun. Rules are mere suggestion to her.
---
Lawful Evil should be Oryx. Sword Logic is a law.
---
potatoes for everyone
---
Btw I got the peacekeepers in the engram and the jade rabbit 5 min later in the edz
---
Right, but unfortunately I have to complete a HEROIC public event of a very specific type and in a specific place. If it's just you and your fireteam, go for it. Speed run that shit. If there's other people participating, you are causing them a ~30 min delay to redo the event. You also need to complete heroic events for triumphs
---
Warlocks definetly have the highest skill gap. The other classes are op, warlock is balanced
---
That being said warlock master race. The moment you get good exotics shit gets real. Start nkw
---
yes. im upset that people are downvoting him. it happens all the damn time. typing in " how to make events heroic on earth, mars, and IO" in google comes up with a video, no need to even click any links.
---
Should I use lvl 30 XP boost?
---
This catalyst hurt me. I hated doing this because game mechanics made this stupidly difficult to pull off efficiently. :( 
---
Ah I see. Yes, I highly recommend one of each if you have the time and enjoy the game enough. It's fun to experience all the facets of the game. 
---
Sparrows, ships, ghost shells, armor... 99% can have shaders applied to them. But the thing you see and use 99% of the time while you play? Nope. 
---
No.
---
You need to actually learn the class, they arent like the others where theyre fine just picking up. Also you need to get them exotics
---
But of youre already pretty good at the game, just boost it.
---
Also works if you change Destiny 2 to 'Bioware' and Jokers Wild to 'endgame'. 
---
Ok, since I haven‚Äôt played warlock yet, I will just grind and hope I can get it done soon!
---
The boss appearing. It's a reference to a Destiny 2 related article in Kotaku or Wallst Journal where the dude was telling to tell a blueberry how to turn it heroic but hey refused to believe the guy responsible for writing articles about the game and kept telling him it was random lol. 
---
Very funny article, worth a Google search
---
If you dont plan on maining warlocks use the boost
---
There are very few as is which is true,but the guns are still the worst thing to happen to meta
---
if he sold forsaken exotics that would be bad tho right?
---
Not really, as i said before the people who grinded for it deserve to use it. Use snipers and stay at a range with a shotgun as well
---
Nice roll
---
How is asking on Reddit a problem?
---
‚ÄúYay another duke...‚Äù I feel you 
---
I‚Äôve seen plenty of videos on ‚Äúwhy the warlock is the best‚Äù so I will try, and if I don‚Äôt like it, then I will stop, but if I do like it I will use the boost
---
He's a janitor
---
Top tree golden gun looks exactly like the last word with no ornaments
---
killed by the architects
---
Yeah it was guaranteed 5 shots because of the slugs. They work at any range. Should still be the case. Not sure how it is against supers now though
---
Before Mercury was a patrol zone, Titan was the smallest, most pathetic planet in the game.  But now that I see this picture it makes me realize how much unused space exists in all of the planets.  They definitely should do something with this area though.
---
I would suggest watching the vidoc but basically shorter more intense gambit with soft rolls and armor sets for those rolls.
---
One round
---
Boss is gonna have mechanics like a mini raid boss
---
You can drain the enemy teams motes
---
The gambit prime have armor set bonuses if you go the white armor set (collector) expect small bonuses to anything banking and collecting of motes.
---
Tether hunter here... if I pop tether right when it spawns I get the entire super back immediately thanks to Orpheus Rig... I just rain tethers the entire time tbh
---
Most talkers use Discord, at least on PC
---
I'll check the vidoc. Thanks for the quick rundown, you're awesome.
---
I did it on my warlock and have the sniper and still got the quest step. I'm not sure if I got it because I dont have the catalyst or ship though.
---
Like a public one? Figure my best bet is to find a clan. Any advice on the best way to do that?

Lord of wolves isnt a shotgun. It says it is, but it isnt

You can only choose one side for all 3 characters. You can't do both on 2 different characters. If you choose one side. You stay with that side forever on every character 
---
burh DIM review is bs.
---
So Destiny 2 has no endgame? (Fashion.) I didn't realize this question was so confusing o.o
---
fuck, I fell.
---
I can do it on every class, no? :)
---
Nope
---
If youre asking if destiny has a variety of different armor sets, yes... if youre asking if destiny has like, buttplugs or something then no...
---
Outside super arcstrider is...meh?
---
Gunslinger fits best for HC.
---
ERrrrrrr I wasn't asking for buttplugs but armor that enhanced the gluteal region.
---
Same. Like 5 times in a row I matchmade with people who couldn't even get the primeval because they couldn't pull the trigger, but the enemy team are a bunch of quickscoping madmen with Queensbreakers and Snipers and never push during their invasions because they aren't even that good but my teammates STILL die because they wanna take out the invader but ultimately die because the invader is a quickscoping madman with Queensbreaker or a Sniper.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
My theory for this is because the matchmaking system matchmakes people with others with the same Winstreak. And the game JUST so happens to match me with people who never even could dream of getting a win streak, while matching me AGAINST people who met their match on a maximum win streak. So yeah. Guess Bungie just hates us
---
yes there are beards but there are no butts since its first person 
---
He just yeeted your ass boy 
---
I still slap it on for low hp ads in all kindsa stuff.
---
Not useful for anything that takes more than 2-3 shots to kill though.
---
I thoroughly enjoy it honestly
---
Started at 430CST and ended around 1030. SoS took the longest because we had folks that hadn't done it(including myself) and the boss phase took forever.

Thanks man! üëç

Fuck you &gt;:(
---
wait until next season to start it. Its gonna be impossible with only two days in black armory left :(
---
Played it, loved it and then found there was no end game content. &lt;\3
---
It was massive on launch, and many of those 870k subscribers could be from that period rather than current players.

Just surprised its still alive tbh.

Can we pin this to the top of the subreddit lmao

If Goblins are the ones that drop you exotics, why are you never going to kill them again?‰πÅ(‡≤• Õú ñ‡≤•)„Ñè

I want them to bring back that blue gun forgot its name used to go on streaks with that gun with bladedancer.
---
Get skull of dire ahamkara exotic helmet, use the top nova bomb skill set, always use the nova bomb on groups of 5 or more adds.... reap the rewards 
---
Yeah but what's the actual quest , like I'm pretty sure I've got it I'm not sure 
---
The trespasser! Ye that gun was amazing üòÇ
---
Ahh there we go i loved that gun reminded me so much of robocop and hellsing.
---
Hey hey hey I‚Äôll have you know COMP is boring as hell to ya know 
---
Man I'm at 8 of 10. Reset 3 times and only got 2 kills that whole time. So many close calls. Dudes are super hungry.
---
I look at the levels, 650 light with 1k voices and godroll black armour gear? Yeah fuck off you should know this. Anything below max light and I don‚Äôt expect much though.
---
Ahh nevermind I've got it , thanks I'll grind for this when the new season starts 
---
Get ready for a broken crucible
---
Especially if your still doing black Armory content
---
Most of them changed the color schemes and patterns on it. The bygones ornament is dope af with certain shaders
---
Nope.
---
I only have 4 and ive been playing since the start of the season
---
Fucking use your supers, please
---
I've had it proc on Spectral Blades and it didn't kill. But then, I've also had Sleeper not kill Spectral Blades, so I guess it can't be helped?
---
How about you educate yourself on how to turn the event heroic? Dumbass noob
---
I swear it's easier to get stacks when you just haphazardly run around in a group than so the whole sneaking thing. We went so slow on one PuG that we got 24 stack and ran out of time. 
---
*unzips pants*
---
A stupid reason. Why, because Zavala didn't abandon his entire duty to send his entire force of guardians after Uldren? Like an enraged 5 year old? If he would have done that, the fallen, vex, taken and cabal would have had a field day with the last city... AGAIN. Only the dumbest of commanders launch their entire force against something in retaliation. Ikora got emotional but immediately realized why it couldn't be done. Otherwise no one in the tower could have stopped her. Its canon, no one in the tower can even adequately challenge her. Shes a warlock powerful enough to use the light alone to change the rifts of time, hold open the infinite forest [something Osiris himself said is literally completely impossible in every single simulation, in every single bit of data he has gathered about the forest. She could have very easily went after Uldren, but she realized Zavala was right, as much as she hated it. 
---
I connect with this on spiritual level.
---
Turn in schematics  to anna ive gotten a couple from her also doing them which come from the stems getting the sleeper nodes 
---
I HATE when theres a group with 1 or 2 new people and while we're trying to teach them the othe guys are fucking around. Give us 2 minutes of silence and then you can keep messing around.

As a solo player, I can hit my targets fine, that's not the issue with GG.  Why anyone would walk into an open space after hearing that ult sound is beyond me, let alone a whole team like in the post.  Meanwhile, I can't rely on any of my team following me anywhere, even if they see what I'm doing.  I either get gunned down or worse I get punched by some immortal freight train of lightning that can one-shot me by looking vaguely in my direction but I have to 2-tap at least while they're flying at me at mach 5.  If we want to go back patches, it used to last half as long as it does now, on top of the more recent changes that made it more user friendly.
---
Yes, it is a higher-skill super, because everything about it is hard to use.  If you wonder why people prefer to use literally any other hunter super in the game, it's because they're all more effective at killing other players, and yes, I include Shadowshot in that.  I will be Blade Barrage Man for the rest of time because if I need to survive a half-a-second extra it will actually protect me, not play a sound effect that says "HERE I AM, I HAVE ACTIVATED MY ULTIMATE ABILITY, BUT IF I ACTIVATE IT IN A FIGHT I'M A DEAD MAN, SO FEEL FREE TO AVOID IT ENTIRELY" across the entire arena. I mean there's enough talk here about how Hunters are not so secretly the slowest class in the game - it's not like I can catch a Warlock or Titan if you decide to run the other direction when you hear that sound. 
---
To sum up, yes you can pull off some great plays with GG but what makes those plays amazing is that you lived long enough to fire more than twice. Staying alive and getting kills feels almost entirely dependant on every other player in the game.  
---
Normally I'd ignore responses like this but the amount of stupidity in one post was giving me a headache. Just let me ask, do you understand the concept of an analogy kid? Because it's so unexplainably painfully obvious that nobody was talking about crucible that for you to imply that I was under the impression to the contrary is ridiculous.
---
So once you've read up and understand the concept of an analogy, feel free to come back and argue why someone announcing they are repeatedly going to repost a graph explaining how to do heroic events until these "blueberries" get it right is less elitist than a crucible elitist posting a graph on how to get better in crucible. 
---
One punch Dreg.
---
Only 12am? You must he good at the game
---
It could be, but if hes afk for round 2, leaves and comes back and being afk for round 3, they deserve it
---
Sedia, there were enemies in that strike called ‚ÄúBound To Sedia‚Äù so maybe she can take? She could take all of them and win...
---
I'm all aboard with the right side of the wrong!
---
My best hazard has Zen Moment and Quickdraw. Through a minor spec on there and it still felt like ass. Maybe should have been a backup mag, but it just chewed through ammo with no noticable effect.
---
I like the ringing nail personally. Breakneck feels to awkward when there isn't a bunch of hive to slaughter.

That‚Äôs the idea

---
Lol. Your opinion is moot. This isn't an opinion. It's a fact. Titans have far better exotics. The fact you can't even give an example of all these super op hunter exotics you claim exist, shows your bias. 
---
This is where you go,
---
"Uh duh....the uh....um....stompies are op. So are the froaties.... Um....wormhusk.....um......um.....um.... SHUT UP HUNTERS ARE OP!!! (Start crying giant titan tears as you hug your anteas wards, oem, ursa furiosa's, skullfort, and synthocepts.)
---
Your next comment will be defending the oem as not op at all. Maybe even a little under powered..... Titans must need a lot of help huh....almost like the worst players gravitate to the easiest character.....just unheard of in any other game right?
---
Go ahead. Tell me how great the hunter nuetral game is compared to the crybaby titans. Maybe the slower hunter is still to fast for a titan to shoot? Idk. Or maybe because a hunter can't jump as high or fast as a titan, makes them almost TOO slow to hit? Or maybe the dodge just baffles you every time. Walls make sense, huh buddy. 
---
Ever think YOU might be the problem? Maybe you should start... We'll try again when you turn 15.
---
They're being posted on social medias, with links to websites, and being pinned threads within the various destiny threads. The latest one is titled 'Praxic Order'
---
Now go get your loaded question. 
---
That must have made it easier, i didn't grind much, me and my friend love gambit and I just made sure I put on hazard for every match and basically just got it by playing. Has taken me all season though lol
---
Think of it as a shotgun with continuous fire. It is a close quarters weapon with not great range. I usually pair it with my trust or another longer range auto. Lunification boots are great with it also for continuous ammo. 
---
Wow
---
Gonna be 20 soon! Can't wait for a blueberry to do that. I use my "flip out" emote too much during Gambit... this is the main reason. Someone with 3 motes stealing my 10th for the 2nd or 3rd time is the other
---
They should make a raid here.
---
Im very satisfied to say got breakneck less than three days after it dropped and never went into gambit since
---
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **1st Cakeday** JohnStonesFC! ^(hug)
---
SUN OR BALL OF CONVECTIVE FLAMING GASES?
---
Judge you? I AM you
---
You ruined the heroic event! Now I have to wait five minutes for the next one!!! Gaaaahhh
---
Use rubbing alcohol and a cotton swab or anything that'll fit (and come back out) to clean them. 
---
Or buy a used one and go home, next day return your controller that's dirty (I know I'm a bad person)
---
The only time I saw the meatball was this morning and my team couldn‚Äôt pull through for the win. I‚Äôm so bummed...
---
This should be an emote
---
Ever since Cayde died I feel like hunters are being more distant than ever before like my closest thing to a favorite character is ana brey now and her character arch is done so I think I'll go with drifter bc I'm a hunter main and think it'd make sense. 
---
Hardest part this week was dealing with damn premades everywhere. Bungo should think about separate solo/premade matchmaking.
---
Yeah but your in brave lol just go play one more game and you‚Äôll get promoted regardless of win or loss
---
....In a dungeon that you have ran 100 times. 
---
&gt; if we crossed him we‚Äôd regret it
---
- we get Last Word, essentially crossing Drifter
---
- he chuckles at our audacity to play both sides
---
Anthem is shit tbh
---
Anteas isn't neutral game exotic, it's situational. Ursa is a super exotic. Skullfort is useless when you can't shoulder charge people because everyone has a shotty and because you need to run bottom tree striker for a waaay better super. Synthoceps are useless again, because of the shotties.   
---
So, neutral game titan exotics are oem (which is broken, like I said 3 times already), armamentarium, mask of the quiet one - very weak effect, crest of alpha lupi - good effect, but barricade is on a much higher cooldown than hunter dodge and is slower than dodge, locks you in place; hallowfire - good, but second part of its effect requires you to hold on to super - that's bad; lion rampant is good; dunemarchers are good but second part of its effect is melee.  
---
So in the end titans have 7 neutral game exotics, 1 of which is broken, 1 of which is very weak, 1 of which is inferior to the hunter counterpart, 2 that have flaws. So basically only 3 are good.    
---
Now back to hunters. I mentioned 8 exotics: dragons shadow and stompies are both very strong and have no flaws, DS is tied to dodge, but dodge is the fastest ability to regen and isn't situational like barricade, it's used constantly in firefights; frosties have no flaws, they just reward you for sprint, which happens constantly; wormhusk - no flaws; knucklehead radar - a bit weak, but isn't useless, because keeping radar on aim is always good and precise radar on crouch is good too; lucky raspberry and shinobu - no flaws, just improved grenades, very simple; foetracer is self explanatory. So thats 8 good neutral game exotics, neither of which have useless effects or require any sort of sacrifice to use secondary effects.  
---
8 &gt; 3. Simple math.
---
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see what we got.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúRecursion! Overflow some stacks.‚Äù.
---
It's not. I picked D2 Forsaken a week ago and the quest on the same day, finished it 2 days ago. 
---
I hope so, I was only able to get the sweet buissness when I did it
---
I saw someone doing this last night too
---
I think we need a buff to non-LMG heavys in PVE. Thunderlord is either the best or second best heavy weapon for every single activity except Crucible, it's kinda ridiculous. I like how powerful it is, but it's lame that there's so many fun exotics not seeing use.
---
I thought that too 'till I saw Patrick Stewart's face.
---
You did the breakneck quest 3x????? Dude just transfer it to the other characters as needed.
---
Oh great news, let's just hope I will like Gambit enough to do all the challenges... Thanks for the info
---
Ikora boutta c l a p some cheeks. 
---
^(And shaxx gang)
---
Because of our visit to the court when she disappeared after saying something ominous. 
---
Because disappearing without clearly stating a reason = that person is up to no good
---
I'm still not sure if I like Loaded Question.
---
Breakneck is an exotic strength weapon with the legendary tag. God I love that thing
---
Oh my god, this is so true! Our bedroom feeds directly into the living room and she‚Äôs spent many nights listening to me ‚Äúquietly‚Äù yell this. Haha. I miss this raid but my group has fallen apart, so I haven‚Äôt even raided in a while. Haven‚Äôt even attempted raid lair 2 and the newest raid from forsaken.
---
the difference is MW items and Legendary items that all feel like exotics and you can wear as many you want and not just two
---
I only joined the middle one because exos are fun 
---
How was unintentionally getting The Last Word crossing the Drifter?
---
lol it's ok a few days 650 be old
---
News :)
---
Updated: SNAKE WITH A POLE, DRAGON WITH SWORD IN ITS NECK, FISH JUMPING OUT OF A ROCK
---
Pair with actium war rig in Gambit.
---
It does good damage, but lacks range. Being able to fire longer makes it a monster. It's not that great. With the catalyst it could have been a game changer for sure.
---
Been playing since late November and got the Cerberus+1 in the beginning but man that gun is my go to gun in PvP. Tried using other guns but always come back to it in the end.
---
Haha, can't forget AoS or LW
---
Nice, I got 15, now to kill the remaining invading mobs. 
---
You inspect everyone during an event?
---
I‚Äôm playing all these matches and use Autos primarily anyhow, it‚Äôs no skin off my nose.
---
I‚Äôve done Ace three times and Last Word twice, too. Haven‚Äôt gotten Malfeaseance more than once or I‚Äôd do that too.
---
Back in Y1 I‚Äôd Masterwork several of the same weapon for each character. I know I can transfer stuff or pull from collections, I transfer all the time but I ain‚Äôt spending those cores. But if I‚Äôm playing a given game mode anyhow, why not just let the quests do themselves?
---
Still has the same hitbox though :p
---
Yes, the quests will still be available.
---
This isn't even the first flying on console (XBox One) post today.
---
Switched to PC about a month ago and purposely didn't do it yet for A the extra power next season and B fuck all that Gambit just for a season of it haha
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs god roll for pve. I have the same roll and I used it for the Luna‚Äôs Howl quest
---
More like after the trigger is missed i passive aggressively click through as many as I can 
---
T'is useful information but was kinda hoping for someone dump a URL, I follow corporate/business stuff one social media i literally just use it to contact friends.
---
If you're doing it anyway, then ya it doesn't matter. I just can't believe you have played 120 Gambit matches in the season.  Seems like a crap ton
---
Yeah but the Breakneck was an item worth grinding for. I haven't seen anything interesting from the new Gambit yet.
---
Gonna have to say this but
---
HUNTER MASTER RACE BITCHESSSSSS
---
&gt;When I go to Xur, he never has it
---
Right now Xur can only give year 1 exotics. Next season he will be able to *sell* Forsaken exotics, but his engram still won't have them. 
---
Do all powerful gear activities every week. That's your best chance at getting exotics. 
---
Wow Ive been sitting at 7/10 for like 3 months 
---
This game is dizzyingly complex. I have so much to learn... Going to watch this now, thank you very much for your help. 
---
Wait can you still get it when the season ends?
---
Destiny has been my most played game sense it came out but I never cared about ever cared about cosmetic items being locked behind a paywall. Bungie losing its funding from activision to be a solo developer and publisher is a fine enough reason for me to purchase these cosmetics for once as long as it means they promise to grow the game into the best it can be. The kids who are complaining about this need to view from Bungie‚Äôs view point and understand how a business with investors work. I‚Äôm not one to complain about not being able to earn useless cosmetic items. I think the eververse engrams are a fair way to earn these via light/exp progression 
---
I got mine from 4 stacking and occasionally a invader pops a golden gun and I just snipe him.
---
Having a Ghost does not make one a Guardian. Standing in support of the Vanguard does.
---
He is a lightbearer at most.
---
You gotta use it like a closerange rocket launcher with auto-loading holster.
---
I don't think exotic weapons should have ornaments.
---
Shit, I didn't know that. Appreciate you. This helps me to realize how out of the loop I really am.
---
1. The game prioritizes matches already in progress. 
---
2. The game will not rearrange teams to put you on the winning team. It puts you in the spot that is open, no matter what team it is on.
---
I need them for his bounties
---
You use them to buy bounties which has exclusive loot and a chance to drop exotics
---
A few matches ago, I had all 4 people pop super, but they were all instant supers that I couldn‚Äôt finish them fast enough with hammerhead. And it was all in within one invasion. 
---
Thundercrash, killed him right after he landed.
---
Nova bomb, kill him after it hit the prime.
---
Tether, same as above.
---
Dawnblade, he was too far from me to kill.
---
I was so sad when I checked and none of them counter. 
---
Ahh ok, thanks for the answer. I guess I'll just wait for them to figure it out
---
You‚Äòre right, he‚Äòs a lightbearer, not a Guardian.
---
Allright
---
Correct!
---
Do the powerful gear bounties also like for the drifter and spider also 
---
SO I WAS LISTENING TO SHOOTING STARS AND IT HAPPENED 
---
Got my tenth one today. 
---
Pulse rifles are bloody op for real...
---
Well put together. Interesting stuff! üëèüëè
---
I got my Breakneck, went "Huh, neat", and then threw it away for my Godroll Bygones.
---
Still worth it because I'm a mad collector.
---
No problem! Enjoy the tidbits they're slowly feeding us before Tuesday, it cannot come quick enough!
---
The lore behind Ada is really showing what dicks the Guardians were. 
---
When I'm killing hundreds of fallen to get a scout rifle I wonder if we still are.
---
Sweet Business + Lunafaction Boots
---
I literally got 40 matches before I hit the number of AR kills. Then i busted out that combo and I turned into a TF2 Heavy.
---
This is why I take it upon myself to make sure that blockers *don‚Äôt* exist and go running moteless to meet every invader I can. One must shepherd the flock.
---
Solo Gambit is basically a really complicated escort mission with terrible AI.
---
Forges stay. We just get more stuff to do with the new season
---
*its, not it's
---
*Horny*
---
yup, ruined so much for cause something was op in pvp. like the nova warp, went from okay at add clearing in pve to absolutely useless ult in pve.
---
I agree it was op in pvp, but they need to learn how to balance separately, so stuff like this don't happen
---
So dont solo queue, the solution for pretty much every team oriented game mode. I hope its treated like Trials that forces you to be on a team. 
---
this is brilliant!
---
It does not. 
---
There was a huge bug where you'd get pledged to more than one faction and the rewards would wig out.
---
And even though it was filler, its slot has been taken by nothing. Like they could just leave it in and people could ignore it if they didn't feel like it.
---
MEGA R.I.P
---
That just makes it easier if you go in with a full fireteam. Chances are that your opponents are randoms. 
---
It's faster to burn the boss, and then go do another event and burn that boss too, they often spawn in back to back like that. waiting the 4 minutes to capture the boss is an eternity. Unless you need to complete the heroic for a quest it really isn't worth it.
---
Completely agree.  I can‚Äôt understand how everyone is willing to stick with the vanguard after everything considering they barely lifted a finger to help cayde or with the dreaming city war.
---
How do you think anyone with Dredgen feels.
---
Then you realize he had shards of galanor,orpheus rig or skull of ahamkara as their respective classes and recovers 75%-100% of his super
---
and destiny's abilities feel like a joke compared to anthems
---
two different games which focus on two different play styles. in d2 your abilities are more to support you, while in anthem guns feel like the support for abilities
---
IMO it's a better mid-range add clear weapon. Because of the reverse falloff damage it isn't very good at point blank range but at mid-range you hit multiple ads at once.
---
The last step is tough. But a team wipe is not impossible, and if you're patient it will get done by your team mates. 
---
Got mine yesterday and had 6 matches left. Felt like forever, but I finally got it. And then bungie drops the vidoc.  D R E G E N  T I M E
---
It's not even that i dislike PVP,i just hate tryharding and comp = tryharding 
---
Sorry only just coming back to the game and seeing a few posts like this. Is gambit bad? People dont seem to like it but it looks to be really cool. 
---
The last I heard was that they don‚Äôt just want to release it even though they know everyone wants it back. But they want it to really be something special when it does come back. I think it may come back next season, especially with Bungie developing a story around the Nine having a connection with Drifter. Could be setting the stage for what‚Äôs to come with Trials.
---
If you have friends who play the game, or you are really into the grind; it would be worth coming back.
---
It's definitely worth buying Forsaken. I think whether the annual pass is worth it is more subjective. If you don't play very much, I don't think it's worth it, since you cannot access Black Armory until after finishing Forsaken, and even though the Season of the Drifter things look cool, if you don't like Gambit you may not like the Season of the Drifter things. 
---
Luna's has been in the game for like 2 seasons now. Don't worry, it isn't going anywhere. [These are the only things disappearing with the season change.](https://old.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/avz648/a_list_of_everything_disappearing_with_the_season/)
---
Thanks guys, not near 2100 just completed the HC challenges so grinding up now, be easier now I can use a load out I‚Äôm used to

There you go. The links are in order.
---
Raid is on dreaming city and is 550 light level 
---
No problem! I talked to the guys and we're all excited to meet you and your friend
---
dreaming city?
---
Shardscopter
---
There's a lot of things you would have learned by playing through that you bypassed with the character boost, which is why it is now so overwhelming. I don't know if I have the time to write up cliff's notes for literally the whole game right now, but in short, once you hit power level 500 you will see some things appear in the game that give "powerful gear," and you will have a buff on you character called prime attunement. To get above 500, prime engrams and powerful gear are the only way. Also you should do some exotic weapon quests, as most raid groups will expect you to have the early game quest exotics. 
---
&gt;Also, how do I choose my hunter path now?
---
I don't understand what you are asking. Are you asking how to change subclass elements? First of all, before doing anything else you should poke around the character menu to familiarize yourself with it. To change subclasses, hover over the diamond shape above your guns in the character menu, and click on the element you want. You can choose between 2 branches for each element to start with, and throughout Forsaken you can unlock one additional branch per element. 
---
You have a lot left to do then lol. I dont have time to explain it to you so I would just look up how to unlock dreaming city 
---
Uh-oh
---
For your character development; don't worry about your choice.  It all gets unlocked pretty quickly.
---
First things first, complete any and all story missions you have.  These will be large colourful icons on the map.
---
Second you should complete adventures.  These are orange symbols on the map.
---
Once you've done that you're onto the final step which is doing various activities to grind your power level.   Crucible, gambit, strikes, daily missions, flashpoint.  If you're not worried about rushing your power level then take your time trying out all the options available to you and getting a good feel for the content.
---
If you want to power level as fast as you can then first grind your power level to the 'soft cap'.  That's the point where random loot drops are not higher than your equipped stuff anymore.  Once there you can complete events that reward 'powerful' loot.  There are gold circle icons on maps that show you where you can get powerful loot.  Once complete the circle disappears so its easy to track what you've not done yet.
---
These powerful rewards are available to claim once per week.  Tuesday at 5pm UK time the rewards reset and you're able to look btain them again.
---
Hope that helps for a starter.  There's definitely a lot to do but just take your time looking around and you'll soon get up to speed. 
---
last night i found a guy who said shoot  the &lt; &gt; corners of her mouth. i cant explain this in text to well but don't aim for the ball aim for the corners like &lt; 0 &gt;....... hope this makes sense
---
\^ the taken ball
---
&gt;where is the raid? is it still the leviathan? it says the required light is only like 300?
---
The base game and each DLC added a new raid (Season of the Drifter is the exception). So yes, Leviathan still exists, and is still power level 300, because people with the base game can only reach 300 and it would be unfair for the raid's power level to change. There is also Eater of Worlds and Spire of Stars, launched from the same page as leviathan. 
---
The raid added with Forsaken is called Last Wish, and is launched from the Dreaming City (all raids are launched from the map of the planet they are on). I know it *says* recommended power level 550, but you may have a hard time finding a group if you are below 560-570. 
---
No dude. Content is dried up. 
---
But sure, if you enjoy doing the same boring things each week. 
---
First I am gonna go over the Warlocks class ability the Rift. Using that let's you drop either a healing field that slowly adds an overshield if you or others are already at full health or a damage boosting one. 
---
Now as a Dawnblade you have access to Attunements of Sky, Flame and Grace as the Forsaken one. 
---
Attunement of Sky is about Arial combat. You can fire weapons and throw grenades without interrupting your glide, a Dodge that is only usable in air and kills while airborne give energy to all abilities including your Super. Speaking of the Super, Daybreak in general let's you fly around and throw flaming swords and the Attunement of Sky variant completely refills your other abilities when you activate it. The melee of this Attunement is less spectacular, you get a movement and reload speed buff on hit. This one is currently the weakest of the three. 
---
Attunement of Flame is more aggressive. Your melee burns and explodes enemies if it kills them and holding circle while airborne drops you to the ground and heals you or burns enemies around your landing point if you are in your Super. The rest of the Perks is focused on your Super, Daybreak. The Swords track and explode and kills during it extend it's duration. It's amazing at killing groups of small enemies.
---
Attunement of Grace is the most support focused  you can be in Destiny. You can convert your Grenades into healing orbs that give overshield when picked up and melee buffs your and allies damage for a short duration. In addition everytime you heal or buff someone, with one of the abilities or a rift you get energy for all your abilities. Also your Super, Well of Radiance, has you slam your Sword into the ground as the focus for a massive rift that combines both normal rifts in a stronger version. This Attunement pairs well with the Lunafaction exotic that constantly refills ammo for you and allies while in a Rift and Phoenix Protocol which refills your abilities including your Super for every kill and assist you get in your Well of Radiance. 
---
Now onto Stormcaller. That one allows access to the Attunements of Conduction, Elements and the "new" one is Control. The standard Supe, . Stormtrance, allows you to move around and shoot chain lightning from your Fingers. It's generally only useful for add clear.
---
Conduction allows your Grenades and Melee to chain lightning to nearby enemies. If you use your Super with full Grenade and Melee energy you increase it's duration and heal yourself to full, also you can teleport during it.
---
Elements is a support Attunement, though not to the extent of Grace. Your melee has a longer reach and recharges your abilities on a kill, you and allies standing in your Rift gain a small Ball of Energy flying around your head that shoots at enemies and your rift recharges quicker near allies. In addition when activating your Super a strong lightning explosion ocvours6around you.
---
Attunement of Control is currently an extremely strong build. Your melee turns into a range attack that has you throw a ball of lightning in a straight line. Kills cause enemies to drop "ionic traces" streaks of energy that move in your direction and refill your abilities. Should you be critically damaged while in Attunement of control your movement speed is buffed for a time. The best part however is the new Super called Chaos Reach. You fire an aimable beam of Arc Energy from your Hands that deals heavy damage. This one is at its best however if you have the Geomag Stabilizer exotic, because that causes damage with Chaos Reach to extend its duration, turning it into a Boss melting powerhouse.
---
Thats basically all there is. If I had to rate the best Attunements of every Subclass, I'd go with Chaos, Grace and Control. Also Warlocks don't really depend on exotics too much, as most of them simply let you regain abilities quicker. 
---
... until forsaken. Nolan North (ghost v2) does a lot of cayde's lines through the campaign.
---
Same
---
If they have him do Bender's voice even once I would have to remain.
---
I will choose Taken and I will master it before it master me
---
I resolved to look them all up when I figured out it wasn‚Äôt a random thing. 
---
Yea cause that's easy. 
---
‚ÄòShoot her in the cheeks‚Äô
---
I thought I was the only not too excited about the season of the drifter... hopefully there's something else than gambit to do!
---
Ok, this is good to know! Yea, what inspired me to start playing today was that recently released dev video about the Gambit stuff. I was like ‚ÄúDamn, that stuff looks badass‚Äù. Haha. I don‚Äôt even really know much about the raids or anything, I just bought this game because it was cheap and I love the art style. 
---
Wait, people still play d1
---
And...??
---
Not exactly sure if you had a question of some kind? 
---
There is lots to do. No need to rush and catch up. 
---
Allegiance quest has way more weight to it tho
---
This part would be pretty damn good for SRL.
---
The production cost for the game mode and the tracks wasn't worth it. 
---
The ripple is the best, wish this was animated.
---
Honestly having *twice* the aim assist it was intended to have is a pretty significant issue. It‚Äôs not a meta thing, it‚Äôs literally broken.
---
I absolutely love Loaded Question since I got mine 
---
Not gonna lie, I got a little carried away with my new MW Whisper Friday and I melted that Walker. It felt so good and so shameful at the same time. 
---
Lol. I got my outlaw/rampage roll during my first ever run of the nightfall myself, so I can't complain about rng too much, but I haven't had a decent roll in the next 40ish more runs. Anyway have fun with the god rolls :D
---
Na just letting the community know 
---
Couldn't you just break the extras down though? Although if he's playing that much he probably isn't hurting for the mats. 
---
Yeah no reason to rush as far as I will be behind lol
---
The game isn't for the causal now. It's much more of a grind but it does embrace it. The forsaken expansion is a work of art and I haven't been without stuff to do for the last few months. It's worth sinking some serious playtime into.
---
It ain't that bad chief
---
Congrats man. I want a title but i probably will never get one because I don't want to chase rng
---
They are making it so you can kill supering enemies as a invader
---
I can‚Äôt wait to stick it to Zavala ,(accept on 3rd character we can be friends)
---
&gt;I play walock alot myself 
---
Thats a load of bullshit right there
---
&gt;Still nova warp doesnt take any skill. 
---
Tell me, how?
---
&gt;Nerf was way to late anyways.
---
Does it matter when it was? Its dead now
---
Alright
---
Exactly
---
Anthem simply needs time to grow, I enjoyed the campaign but the grind afterwards fell on its face for me...you just don‚Äôt feel compelled to grind, lack of motive 
---
Tf are you talking about? The boss is literally the fastest part of TM
---
Have you even played the game? Have you even seen a live stream of it??
---
Well  nearly 1/3 of my playtime is on walock so i play it quite a bit. 
---
Its still a massive aoe 1 hit roaming supper. Just because it cant kill people in theire ult anymore wont make it useless.
---
Just keep invading until you hit 420, and then keep going until you hit 6969, and then until you hit 42069, and then...
---
You‚Äôre being awfully dramatic about this. The boss is typically where you‚Äôll see wipes and takes longer than the other encounters. 
---
Fuck. You right 
---
Not really, I just want at least one title &amp; Dredgen is the only one im close to getting all i need is the ship from Gambit.
---
YouTube the story ViDoc or allegiance quest thing. I haven‚Äôt watched it all I know is that there‚Äôs a quest where you pick between the Drifters and Vanguards sides 
---
Can someone please clear these f*cking ads!!!
---
After 3 weeks of grind i got my last 2 triumphs for dredgen in one match.
---
It‚Äôs all random, but hey it‚Äôs keeping you playing with your desire for these exotics.
---
Drop rate for exotics you don't have but want = .01%
---
Drop rate for exotics you don't have and don't care about = 10%
---
Drop rate for exotics you already have = all%
---
Scientifically proven with crayons and play-doh.
---
I always thought it would be cool if you could enter a free roam version of the almighty from mercury 
---
I got a team wipe with Blade Barrage and Galanor and only got 25% back at most.
---
It's not that, it's pretty luck based and I'm was with a pretty good lfg team. None of were like pros. Probably only took an hour.
---
Drift-ception is giving a biiiig spook
---
Cool if they weren't all turds
---
Btw, you can open your inventory while loading
---
The quest did change slightly:
---
Redrix's Broadsword Quest:
---
Valor Rank Resets:
---
The Valor rank resets step will now look at previous seasons accomplishments as well.
---
Five Valor resets are still required during a single season, but this is no longer restricted to the current season. Ex: If a player had five Valor resets in Season 4, this will now grant progress towards the quest.

I got sweet business, Aeon Swift, And 7 exotic sparrows of the same one, the only new one I got is ursa furiosa
---
2 from quests, 1 for free and one from Xur. Doesn‚Äôt feel very good to me?
---
Since when different game counts as "polished"?
---
I feel like they‚Äôre always set up to be like that. I was 6 points away and luckily had a bounty to turn in. All my valor resets have come down to 2 points away

Don't be a menace to south central  While drinking your juice in the Hood

Thats why i always have 1 complete bounty of gambit, just in case

It would have been cheapest if you were to buy it with all the DLC. Your best bet is the Xbox store for older content line that.

Sounds like it. In the outskirts going towards Sojourners Camp. If you‚Äôre level 7 he‚Äôll blink and kill you! Shoot by quickly.
---
50/50. It‚Äôs either a duplicate or it‚Äôs not. 
---
Yeah I actually just found a copy of the collection edition for $10 on bestbuy, not sure why it didn't show up when I looked earlier but it looks like I got the last copy they had
---
Polaris is actually pretty good since the scout buff. The rest are turds
---
Nice 
---
Completely fine? There are people that enjoy playing Gambit cause the gamemode is fun to play. Moreover there are people that enjoy playing it solo.
