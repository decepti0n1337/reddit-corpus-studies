Yeah idk wtf is so funny lol. Sorry not everyone has had this game as long as you, neither/nor could put in the same amount of time to get to 650. Shit, this is the third week I’ve had the game, and I’ve been a no-life since and I’m still only at 610 on my main character...

Some of the armor have randomized perks, but I have no plan to use them still. So It’s best if I dismantle them?

Meta will be meta, shit changes and everyone jumps on the new bandwagon. Prom lens week, antipode-d, graviton, telesto and wavesplitter will be waning away in popularity soon. It is what is.
---
I just think it is always more fun to challenge yourself using different weapons and load outs even if you don’t get the stats you normally would, who cares. If I hit half of the snipes vs kills I would get using a shotgun, I’m happy and find it a lot more enjoyable. They don’t need to nerf these, PvP community just needs to step it up to challenge themselves with other loadouts. If you’re good enough to get Not Forgotten come mess with it quickplay some but then try other stuff. You really need to pub stomp all us shittier players over and over? That’s why I love cammycakes vids he plays with meta some but he’s always trying out different non-meta loadouts and setups
---
Bungie got 100 Million from NetEase, so Destiny 3, or whatever their next project is going to be, will be a hard pass. 
---
Its probably the return of ghaul and his red legion or better yet, The Darkness...
---
You do realize you can change your aim as you're shooting right? Or are you saying literally every enemy super I have shut down despite how badly they were destroying me before, were incompetents? 
---
But look at my cool exotic bro it cool and exotic
---
i got it on one of my first tries of EP hahaha
---
I am amazed at how shitty the green/white armor looks. Have not seen it in a very very long time
---
basically kill wizards, clear adds wait for the hyper invade, clear invade dps before second wave spawn and invade.
---
Banner shield be like
---
How do I get new Forsaken exotic armor to drop?, I keep getting repeats of what I already have, I've been grinding with all characters, got just about everything for my warlock and Titan, but last two exotics that I need just won't drop,  is it a bug? or am I doing something wrong.
---
gatchaman strikes again I see
---
This made me chuckle. Someone needs a tractor cannon to the face 
---
Pc players have more invested in their rigs and in general are less casual than console gamers. Not to say that there aren't great console players out there too :) 
---
Wake me up next week
---
That was me. Murika!
---
next week bro
---
It was a joke. Activision had them targeting profit more than making the game good. 
---
Challenges, daily heroics, gambit and crucible once a day. Should be easy to get to 600 these days.
---
Bottom tree sentinel can still spam shield throws 
---
Ohhhhhh no it's not. It isn't meta, but it's a very strong counter when played correctly, and the user has over 20 hours of experience with it alone. I do tend to use chattering bone more than smugglers, but I'll use the latter on maps like Burnout and sometimes Convergence. Main Ingredient can go anywhere though. 
---
Wait shit is the new gun gonna be a crucible quest? Aww man I thought it was gonna be like Thunderlord
---
I got le Monarque in my first ever volundr forge completion😂
---
Thanks
---
Nah
---
Other's answered your question, but I wanted to give [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/a0igko/escalation_protocol_weapon_drop_schedule_updated/) to you in case you might find it as helpful as I did when grinding EP.
---
I was standing next to it. And if my role is to invade, i have less of a chance for a heavy brick to drop. Because im spending most of my time making sure i kill invaders and make sure they loss motes/  dont nuke their boss. So yes, imo,  invaders do have a right to the heavy. But thats just my opinion. If im not invading i let the invader take it, but w.e.

My friend used to attack the blights on the ground, he never believed me when I said he was wrong.
---
 Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Scrubs on Events, 
---
while it looks nice, the fact that the small middle boosters on the back of the ship, more specifically the far left small booster is brighter than the other 2 pisses me off to no end since ive seen it
---
I got a wing contender headgear.... I really wanted that...
---
same gun
---
Wassa matter? Worried your k/d would suffer? 
---
me: got it on my 2nd completion

When Forsaken first came out, there was no curse on the city. The Last Wish raid was released maybe 1 1/2 weeks later, and by defeating Riven in the raid, we started the curse cycle. It was Riven's wish (her last wish before being defeated, hence the name of the raid), that this cycle be in place. The people of the Dreaming City seem to be aware they're stuck in this cycle, and we Guardians work to break it, but it keeps looping. 3 weeks, each week the curse grows stronger and then resets back to the first week. As the lore/story progresses, we may be able to break the curse at some point, I reckon. If you want to know more, I recommend looking it up somewhere. I don't know any good sources, but I'm sure there's a place read up on the lore of it a bit more.
---
That being said, along with the curse cycle, the activities in the Dreaming City that we can participate in change on this 3 week cycle as well. The weekly quest mission (Oracle Engine, Broken Courier, Dark Monastery), Ascendant Challenges (actually there are 6 of these, which basically rotate every other 3 weeks of the curse cycle), Petra's location, enemies in the Blind Well (rotates between Scorn, Hive, and Taken). The appearance of the Dreaming City changes week to week as well. The Shattered Throne dungeon is only available during the strongest curse week (next of which starts Jan 29).
---
Wow you did all the work in copying quotes but completely ignored the fact that the game never ever tells you to even consider that heroic is a thing
---
You realize this sub is populated by a *minority* of players, right?
---
On the character select screen, there is a blue icon to the right of each of your characters. You only get one, and it costs a lot of money to buy more, so use it wisely! Most people prefer to save it for a second or third character. 
---
As far as I know they will always be available. Pinnacle weapons from last season can still be gotten. 
---
Once you pick up a quest it will stay in your inventory forever, with the exception of quests/bounties from holiday events. 
---
Because some people, like a *certain friend of mine*, seem possessed to infuse a weapon THE MOMENT they receive anything with the slightest light level increase on it. Said friend was infusing every single time they got something with 3 or 5 additional light levels, regardless of the piece of gear. I understand you might have favorite pieces of gear, but seriously if that is the case then maybe you should just wait until you have like 10~15+ increases before slapping your enhancement cores down.
---
If you destroy my flagship, it'll take out every other ship in the system.
---
If it's me and a party, we generally wait till blight 3.
---
But if its 1 or 2 and someone is going for it then we get in on that plan too.  Dont want to make them think we are just burn mode.
---
Hahaha, that's tragic! I was wearing Nezarec's Sin at the end of a Last Wish, and when I opened a chest at the end I got an exotic. . . another Nezarec's Sin! 
---
They are getting a nerf in terms of the raw knives not doing as much damage and relying on the explosions to do the damage. The explosions will also cause self damage like nova bomb as well. 
---
Nova warp will receive a nerf in damage meaning you have to charge longer to one shot a guardian and charging consumes supee energy and speed
---
Nothing looks good on the hunter Gambit armor set. 
---
me but with genotypenull and precursor vex chrome.
---
Dumbass post versus nothing.
---
Destiny 1 events didnt go heroic.  Try using Google and not Bing for your research next timr.
---
Looks like volundr but it can drop in the other 2  as well. Probably bergusia also
---
I remember when I watched this episode, when it came out, D1 was in it's prime time, I most definitely think it was a destiny reference 
---
I'd probably agree with you.
---
Uh, except you *can* get random rolls from strikes, engram rewards from factions, and crucible, and more, so... this argument doesn't hold any water.
---
r/fireteams 
---
Yep, rift generator is the missing one... Make heroic by shooting the blight on each of the three areas and then the three wizards that appear around the rift generator. 
---
wish i saw more lord of wolves. really underrated smg imo
---
So theres one less super salty player to complain all the time?  I know you won't get this but damn dude, I'm excited to not worry about the cat who loses 24/7 to show up in my queue.
---
I know you *think* it's because of your teammates bit it turns out that, as a solo queue, you're the only constant.   Seems like you're actually that bad teammate no one wants around.
---
[removed]
---
Y1 armor have no perks, that's what it's about
---
Maybe I'm biased....but Paul Tassi is trash.  Absolute trash.
---
Now to be fair, maybe journalism has changed since I was in school and look for a valid source just isnt a thing anymore.  But I'm going to assume it still is, and the P-Dawg is just a dumpster fire 
---
Yea, well, you actually made a post with a day of this one acting like this should be well known.
---
Do you have an opinion of your own or do you just swallow the circlejerk nearby?
---
Fake... These shits are random! Fucking dumbass
---
/s.
---
So, because he asked the other guy to leave the heavy ammo, it’s okay that the guy purposefully went and lost 101 motes?
---
That’s why I use way of the current 
---
I'll go ahead and save yours as an example of when people want to farm that karma.
---
Maybe I'll use it for when someone is too dumb to realize that their post history and flippy floppy dumb statements are easy to check out.
---
But your logic is that you have to buy newer content to have armor with perks, which isn't true. I 100% agree that I'd like to see older armor made relevant again, but your previous statement is also not true.
---
Hmmm.  You have a clear issue with looking things up.  Let's not pretend that as far as you know is any sort of statement that should be taken seriously.
---
Grimoire is different than the book of sorrows.
---
How can we dumb things down for you?
---
Had to go immediately try this for myself. Yeah you're right, it definitely works better this way. 😁
---
I’m stuck there too and almost want to give up. Are you on Xbox? I’d be more than happy to try and beat this with you.
---
doubt they will, like you said its an unnecessary grind, its only purpose is to slow our leveling down
---
remember the first thing they changed was how long it takes us to level and how must XP we get to make it longer
---

Someone else posted it. I just finished the base game and didn't know about **any** of them.
---
Mercury and Mars are the only planets where you can select heroic adventures at any time. 
---
You don't get to dictate how others play the game. You're not entitled to that heavy. You need to get over yourself 
---
I don't know how many times I've hit a hunter with a super and he's popped blade barrage a half second after the impact animation and survived the hit. It's like it sends them back in time.
---
Also sucks when you're on anything but Hunter and both land a hit. If I land a Nova Bomb on him as he lands his Barrage on me, it really sucks that he gets to run off afterwards. I'm assuming this still happens even after the recent tweaks? 
---
Netflix also has a movie called "IO" and the opening line talks about the "exodus project"
---
I'm a Gambit Chrome man myself.
---
Sorry what do you mean by "wave" it? I haven't played D1 unfortunately
---
Meh that doesn't seem like it'll hurt blade barrage too too bad. Also it's a damn good thing I run a chaos reach geomag lock when I PvP my lock. 
---
It's my secret weapon for when crucible pisses me off. I break out the lock and throw 4-6 chaos reaches per match. Nova warp is for chumpies lol
---
Yeah like I get one lightning strike game were I see people running random stuff like Crimson and fusion rifles and have a great time before going back to getting shat on by OEMs and lunas
---
Ty. I can't tell you how many times I've seen the opposing team come from behind and win because I read the only person going after the wizards
---
Not really. Malock was a lvl 100 thrall
---
The late night sweats
---
Thank god the cheese is getting nerfed soonTM 
---
This just reminded me of how small the original vault was in D1. My god, that was brutal. 
---
Shoot me a message when you get to that spot
---
i got this ship when i got the city back
---
False. If they have the same game sense and aim the ttk on their weapons outclass my favorites by far. I.e Lunas Howl.
---
People finally getting exotics in for-
---
That's actually still a pretty dickish way of phrasing it though
---
That has never happened in the entire history of gambit. I am pretty certain that the drifter only tells me to bank my motes and tell the other players to just hold onto their motes until they die. It's the only explanation.
---
Get 150 hip fire precision kills with a primary hand cannon is the first step. 
---
"puzzle"
---
Aka throw a ball at a thing. 
---
I agree, but that's just kinda my personality leaking through
---
Yeah!!!!!.... wait WHAT!?
---
MW? Range or Stability?
---
Eats bosses esepcially with arc singe on. I've used it a lot for solo stuff especially during the haunted forest.
---
The guy literally said he got twelve consecutive invader kills and you're trying to explain invading to him.
---
Jotunn fanboy here... It one shots small blockers, shielded baddies, Invaders and it seems to kill envoys REALLY fast. Does pretty good DPS to the prime, as well. I haven't put IKELOS SG back on since getting Jotunn. 
---
It's so awesome!! **sheds a tear holding x button**
---
My team doesn't kill wizards like people are suggesting. Usually we tractor cannon, well, chaos reach, two blade barrage and sentinel shield. Like the new one with weapons of light. After you use super, use heavy, then shotgun. Takes like 5-10 seconds from spawn
---
Just curious, how in the world did you get a season 2 ship? 
---
There are waaaaay more than just those sets. You're missing trials, faction rallies, iron banner, holiday events, raid sets, solstice, y1 crucible and vanguard, ikora's set, and maybe more.
---
How do you know what he looks like
---
I don't really like it either, but I understand where it comes from. 
---
Wheres the dreaming city one
---
It's the nightfall exclusive drop for the Garden World nightfall
---
Yeah I just watched some videos of it melting bosses post buff
---
Thought it was a sniper tbh
---
Oh. Fair enough. I didn’t really care for the cosmetic side of nightfall exclusive loot to get it. Thanks for clearing that up. 
---
I think it was stability 
---
The tracking on it makes it way too difficult to close the gap or play distance. Not all of us peasants can afford to pay someone to grind Luna’s for us and that’s the only thing I can think of that can drop someone using that weapon quick enough. 
---
Rocket launchers aren’t as forgiving as the Jotunn.  I could see certain frames being extra heavy. But not all of them 
---
I thought about it for a good hour before I dismantled lol, but it was totally worth it. Shader looks great on everything.
---
Let me set the seen. I'm a titan main missing one exotic one eyed mask haven't got an exo5ic in months
---
Swap to my warlock, get 4 exotics in 2 days controversy hold, vertys brow, controversy hold And chromatic fire. 
---
https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/ghost-fragment-the-last-word
---
That's him
---
Yeah...I have one of those if I ever use it, but I just never have it in my loadout.
---
I wish you would care enough about helping to post the current image.  
---
You need room for that fireball slanging Jotunn, anyways. I'd of done the same thing. 
---
That is a serious mood. 
---
Have you even made it to the dreaming city yet or was this just to farm karma
---
Dont worry, I know the answer.
---
Correct! It CAN drop in all forges with a powerful frame. Got mine from Burger last week. 
---
mine will do this in certain modes and on certain planets but I usually have to do is go to the task manager and set destiny 2 to high priority usually fixes it up pretty but good
---
Now get in Burger for Jotunn!!
---
PvE players stay away from crucible...it’s not fun.
---
Lunas, one eyed mask, nova warp. Worst ideas in the history of mankind. 
---
Wow didn't know that...the gun looks huge though unless Shin is a tiny person.
---
Save your thanks for someone who actually posts the correct in image reflecting the entire planet he missed.
---
That's the problem. Ya'll wanna give a trophy to someone who couldn't even put in 2 minutes of time. 
---
Smg, sidearm, and sword. No one can get mad at you for those.
---
Jesus All Those Masterworked Weapons And Exotics
---
Looks goddamn perfect. Can't wait to see it finished!
---
Petition to rework Ether Ritual heroic
---
Honestly, it's just satisfying to get them at all.
---
I knew that it looked familiar! Did you get any credit lol? 
---
oh god
---
Everything is wrong about crucible.
---
It does nothing. You lose the accelerator and gain absolutely nothing 
---
I burned second witch just learned that's a bad call. Thanks guys. 
---
Never
---
Yes, you just need a powerful frame(gold one)
---
It’s so bad that I don’t even want to play it even when it gets better. That’s what happened with Destiny 1 PVP 
---
Im a new player and im confused how to get the Rasputin fragments for the escalation key can someone help?
---
I have a few issues but some will be fixed soon, other than the shotguns and telesto, I have no issues when I win or lose because I understood that I either was reading the moves and making good decisions, or taking too much and rushing. 
---
Lol I love doing that to her 
---
Its always been kinetic
---
You're gonna have a bad time
---
When you least expect it is all the time lol
---
Thanks!!! Basically yelled when I got it! Think I scared my roommate. Now if I would just complete a raid I might be able to finish up the weapons 😂 keep up with the powerful bounties. 
---
So back in D1 (and D2 Y1) the top / up emote was always "wave".. and they looked the same across all three classes.. so people would quite literally "wave" the heavy away with the emote
---
It is as simple and as perfect as it sounds. You literally load in, hit your "up" emote to wave, and if they did the same then neither of you went for it
---
You can get the bow from Bergusian without having the Izanami unlocked. I am ticked off by that. Was trying to get Jotunn and got the bow on my titan. They only char that hasn’t unlocked Izanami...
---
Why do you think that? It feels so slow to me and i play Titan
---
You know the standard excuses...solo player, no friends who play D2, casual clan.
---
I know there are other means of finding players and I will join some group if it is clearly stated that novices are welcome (if I  find such group). Maybe this weekend...
---
I was wondering why there were lvl 50s doing the same public events I was doing while leveling. And also why some of them were heroic events. 
---
Ah so you scrapped it?  I did the same thing with a kindled orchid that had house or meyrin on it. Wasn’t as good as this, but it was still worth it. 
---
I’ve gotta defend myself against shotguns somehow 
---
Haha honestly I was surprised nobody had a counter argument when I posted. 
---
Thanks for the extended time estimates, love the idiot run estimate! :D
---
I always see people doing them in dreaming city. Youre forgetting that the daily quest that gives a dreaming city item is either public events or heroic events half the time.
---
That's the hunter because it's in my first slot so it came up by default I was too dumb to hover over my warlock 😂 but yes those thighs are top tier lmao
---
why hunter mains? over my head 😅
---
At least on PC, whatever direction you jumped in before blinking is the direction you go, so you can’t be moving forward and try and go into a side blink mid-jump. 
---
If you side strafe into a jump then blink you continue to move in that strafe direction. 
---
Moving forwards, but quickly moving backwards before going into a jump will make you blink backwards, etc. 
---
I know it but am not good enough to act on any of it. I’m trying though. 
---
I can finally use the 1.5m plastic hose to suck up those motes 
---
March 5 I believe. They’ve said they’re looking into the stocking up on bounties thing, so it may not actually work this time around, FYI.
---
Where can I find all these????
---
I’m a hunter main. Started a warlock recently. Can’t figure out the jump. How do you even jump *up* anywhere? I can only get my warlock to go horizontal or down. 
---
The camcorder 
---
Eat a bag of dicks
---
Yeah but imagine being able to bait out the shotty ape, and kill him for trying that bullshit because you are JUST far enough away the slide corner doesn't kill you but you can still do massive damage on him
---
Warlock jump would be better with less loss of height over time tbh.
---
Show the part where warlocks get shot to death aimlessly flapping their wings.  
---
Yes, we all have, but did you survive? 
---
I was running the whisper mission at 1 in the morning, and I remembered I had that ability. We ended up having to do it all over again, but the PE for it was already up. 
---
Dying Quickly helps quite bit in the jumping sections 
---
There's one missing... The Rift Generator. This happens in Rheasilvia with tons of scorn waves.
---
It’s from curated BA weapons, be it from the raid or the bazinga forge
---
same......the last thing i need to complete this badge :(
---
Now all that's left is to collect all the bones and eggs and I'm officially a cursebreaker. 
---
Yeah I watched it couldn't help thinking about that auful strike 
---
feel you, same with my friends. one of them doesn't want to because the "competitive" is stressing him out.. :(
---
By my friend rose 
---
Gotta get that Last word in at the funeral
---
When this drops for me I’m gonna clap some people in crucible 
---
It’ll always show the best possible roll in collections 
---
I’ve gotten about a billion of those, and half were kill clip rampage 
---
The golden gun depleted your shield thus making you run out of super energy in time so the blade barrage killed you if he missed a shot you would've blocked the blades and lost your shield.
---
Yea, just do the daily and weekly stuff. One thing that is not shown on the director is the Spider Weekly Bounty (the last one). So don't forget that.
---
Vastly prefer warlock jumping to the other two,but it can be a bitch.
---
Having said that, after any extended time playing another class, I have to set my jump to strafe (usually run burst) for a while so I can control overshooting 
---
Shin will be killed by some random guardian around the corner with dust rock blues 
---
"Word up"
---
It reminds me of the ghost capturer thingy from Ghostbusters. 
---
At the 20 second mark you can see your super bar goes black
---
Yeah I understand what you are pointing out and all. But this happens to my three friends as well, not just me. The weapons don’t do any damage to the enemy when their weapons can just melt our characters in a couple shots. I’ve had people who used Bygone and destroyed me in a couple shots while it took me a bunch of shots just to scratch their shields. 
---
I’m not a all star pvp player by any means and I don’t mean to brag about my skills at all. But it’s definitely not my skills when I land 90% of my shots and don’t even touch my opponents. 
---
I think it’s something bugged with the game itself. It says that it’s light level disabled but it doesn’t show it at all. 
---
Wtf are you talking about warlock jump can go right past the spinning platforms?
---
Oh really! This is definitely my art ☺️ you can find it on my insta!
---
As long as you stand on the puzzle plates you'll be fine just remember to use Strafe glide as from what I can tell it goes the highest
---
I mean depends on what u use i guest. I use strafe glide and some times medium glide and my mobility is always around 2-3 so my jumps are usually not very high.
---
A fun thing I like to try and do while killing time (waiting for the right PE on Io for example) is to emulate the moves used by Osiris in the opening cutscene, in the vault of glass simulation when the Vex attack. The strike-dodge-strike-dash-slam combo is a good one for tight spaces.
---
Dont Thrall turn into Ogres?
---
Nooo You missed the one that he was sitting with us too!
---
Running around doing Vanguard missions with Ace, should not be hard.
---
Are you going to start banning these people that are illegally profiting off of your intellectual property? This is what makes comp aids. People legit making a business of comp farming. 
---
Bungie literally never ban anyone 
---
Yeah, he was pretty cool about it. 😂
---
As a PC player I was even more confused
---
Do the gambit augmented frame each week if you have 3 characters, thats 3 garrunteed weapons each week
---
Try to find someone to do nightfall with
---
🖕
---
Remember how in D1 you had to actually use a weapon for hours before you could upgrade it instead of just dumping a few cores in it?  Youths nowadays man.. 
---
We Are Legion
---
You forgot to add titan with lion rampant’s
---
Repost on the field! Bring a downvote.
---
Monochromatic.
---
no
---
Well what is? I really enjoy the game but I dont see how I can advance any further. My power level is 600 but I'd like to reach 650
---
I have been there, lol
---
It makes you non existent for a second so that is nice
---
I literally had the exact same sentence come up in my head. The exact same sentence, word for word
---
Rule 1 no weeb shit in destiny 
---
What?
---
Right there with you. I spent a good hour jumping into things on Titan as my Warlock (Hunter main).
---
I finally got queenbreaker and shortly after I found a team that I do gambit with. They have one guy that wrecks at invasions so Im just sitting here with my unused queenbreaker..
---
One post would have sufficed. 
---
F
---
leave some pussy for the rest of us pls
---
Lol, felt like I gave myself a stroke. I can’t even figure out what that word should have been. 
---
*chew*
---
Xbox? Ill help, just finished mine
---
I always do the flashpoint, heroic adventures, strikes, crucible, and gambit, after all that I do Dreaming City, Nightfall and Raids, the first activities I mentioned drop 3-4 above your LL and the last activities are usually 5+ especially SOTP
---
I love The Colony, but I'm still waiting for the catalyst to drop so I can finally make orbs with it. 
---
Same I’ve done that nightfall so many times it just won’t drop
---
yOu MeAn CuRaTeD nAtIoNs?!
---
My GT is BetterCallGaul. Hit me up and ill help you finish it. 
---
If you want to get from 600 to 650, you just need to do bounties/challenges that list "Powerful Gear" under the reward section of the bounty/challenge description. That gear will drop above your overall power level. Keep the highest level piece of gear for each slot in your inventory. 
---
As far as exotics, have you done any of the exotic quests or grinded for Lord of Wolves? Also, once you get to about 610 you can start grinding forges for Le Monarque, and closer to 650 you can grind for Jotunn.
---
That's literally a banana with a scope now
---
Works for a team that is coordinating their load outs and managing their supers the entire match, but you can’t do that solo stacked... and people posting asking for strats aren’t in a group like that. 
---
You raise your power level by doing milestones and getting prime engrams exotics are not meant to raise power level they’re just special weapons or armor with unique perks. If you complete your milestones there’s a chance of getting exotics to drop. 
---
Sword was last week
---
Hold up
---
What weapon is this?
---
God, that’s amazing! Thank you for sharing :)
---
I'm more leaning towards Blueshift Dreams at the moment but yes I agree
---
Scavenger perks, and super energy perks(remote connection) make a pretty significant difference. With both, I get first super in pvp, and get 3 ammo per block rather than 1.
---
I don't care how I look, so it doesn't bother me, but just pointing there are some good reasons why y2 perks are much better. Pve activities don't matter much unless you are using riven curse, or transcendent blessings.
---
Saw the progress post the other day/week. Looks dope AF
---
Thanks man took me 5 days but I'm pretty happy with it 
---
I assume this means you want to smash
---
God damn it 
---
Thanks !
---
Oh I haven't been playing much so it's still 560 lmao
---
Scatter against the ground or their will?
---
Buy another? They're only $20 prime on amazon.

Does that friend has to use the Rat King during the patrols?
---
Oh he's not kidding. Not kidding at all.
---
So what frames are specifically for Bergusia?
---
ABSOLUTELY avoid Headseeker. I see a lot of comments here recommending it when in reality it's an absolutely terrible perk, especially on Blast Furnace. [Here's a clip](https://youtu.be/w7gOmHAgfFg?t=300) explaining and showing why it's so absurdly terrible.
---
Ambitious Assassin is not too bad, but if you can I'd just farm for a better roll, there's a lot more variants this gun can spawn as which are insanely good.
---
Fake: that never happens
---
In most games, when you start a new character you start a completely new save game. It's pretty normal to complete story missions to get to certain content with that character. Unlocking an ability often requires you to level up or do some sort of grind. You buy the game so you can play it, nobody owns you free progress; all the players who cared enough about the "new" subclasses have already done it. 
---
This happens a lot. It just wastes so much time.  Often 3 people go and get that one more and have to come back to the bank. It's basically the same as a free invasion to the other team.
---
Ill second that! Im also PC EU if you need a hand.
---
Unless you have abysmal packet loss or are physically disabled, there is nothing stopping you.  Yes, you get shotgun apes and luna's tryhards but if all you do is just get pissed and quit, then you're never going to actually get better.  I still enjoy the games that I get dunked on (if done well, if my team is ass and i'm out of it, then it sucks) cause there's always a fun moment or cool play that happens.  Some matches you get like 2 kills and 15 deaths.  Some matches you get a We Ran Out of Medals.  Shit happens and you move on.
---
Just a question about the Blind well and Curse week, scorn are during low curse week?
---
*unzips*
---
I think it’s time for the fated engrams from Xur to award Forsaken exotics. Enough is enough already. 
---
I’m okay with him not selling all Forsaken stuff each week, but the fated engram should at least be a thing. I’m even okay with them offering two fated engrams to choose from, and have the one that guarantees a Forsaken exotic be double the price of legendary shards. It would at least make it exciting when he shows up each week. He’s totally irrelevant right now. 
---
You’re good lol. I wanted to post it there because it’s more relevant but i wqs disappointed. 
---
Thanks!!
---
is the IKELOS\_SR any good? I have the SMG which is arguably the worst (besides the stupid IKELOS\_HC) and I'm grinding for the shotty. But should I be happy if i get the Sniper?
---
Can't wait to put gambit chrome on the suros with its chrome ornament 
---
Thanks for the reply. So, I can choose more than one region?
---
risky click of the day
---
Sorry, I'm on PC :c

RIP Luna's Howl meh... Or it's permanent and i will be able to get it even next year?

That's definitely a female hunter.

You my friend...are on a whole different level of unlucky-ness

D2 raids are shit
---
The name was changed to match the in game event name, and it used to reference the Gate Lord in the previous version.
---
How do you turn your radar yellow/ greenish?
---
Probably Vanguard Strike
---
All of them! Bergusia is kinda the "Final Forge" in a lot of ways. You can forge any of the frames there. Here's a breakdown: 
---
**Volundr** \- Ringing Nail (Auto Rifle), Hammerhead (LMG), Stryker's Surehand (Sword)
---
**Gofannon** \- Kindled Orchid (Hand Cannon), Tatara's Gaze (Sniper)
---
**Izanami** \- Blast Furnace (Pulse Rifle), Spiteful Fang (Bow)
---
**Bergusia** \- Ringing Nail (Auto Rifle), Hammerhead (LMG), Stryker's Surehand (Sword), Kindled Orchid (Hand Cannon), Tatara's Gaze (Sniper), Blast Furnace (Pulse Rifle), Spiteful Fang (Bow)
---
When completing any of those frames at Volundr, Gofannon, or Izanami there *is a chance* that Le Monarque (Exotic Bow) can drop in addition to the forged weapon. 
---
When completing any of those frames at Bergusia there *is a chance* that either Jotunn (Exotic Fusion Rifle) or a curated version of the weapon you are forging will drop in addition to the forged weapon. A curated weapon will have the Bergusia Night Shader, be masterworked, and have perks that were specifically chosen for it. 
---
So for example if you forged the Kindled Orchid at Gofannon you would no matter what get a Kindled Orchid but have a chance at getting Le Monarque as well.
---
If you forged Ringing Nail at Bergusia you would no matter what get a Ringing Nail but also have a chance at getting either the Jotunn or the Curated Ringing Nail. 
---
Note that Le Monargue, Jotunn, and the Curated drop will only drop when completing the powerful frame. The powerful frame is purchased with a ballistic log and you only get 2 per week per character. When you buy subsequent normal frames from Ada (purchased with 6 modulus reports) they do not have a chance to drop the exotics nor the curated rolls. 
---
You don’t have to because you only have to pay 8$ to not do it
---
There are also 3 power drops available in the Shattered Throne on full curse weeks.
---
Deuteranopia color blind setting.
---

HAHAHAHAHAHA you right you right lol 
---
People don’t understand how hard that is to design and get the colors and shapes correct. Great work.
---
You really can tell that it's a warlock since they ain't running triple jump 
---
Forgot how insane shade-step used to be
---
Thanks it's pretty hard work but I'm getting really into it again after not doing any for a few years
---
No Battle Tag no proof.
---
I knew what it was before I even clicked
---
8-Bit Ace of Spades!
---
Congrats I guess? 1.25 isn’t that amazing tbh
---
The 99% will tell you the shotgun,
---
Im currently enjoying the smg.
---
I don’t have the scout...
---
If you are trying to get this done in PVP you're out of your mind.
---
Serves her right
---
I care bb!! i got mine last night as well, 5th clear but i had given up for almost 2 months haha SOOO satisfying to get it even tho its a shell of what it used to be 
---
Wondering the same. I have the SG and the HC, but haven't really heard much about the SR.
---
If he averages 0.3-0.4, then yeah, 1.25 is that amazing 
---
Got 4 exotics from leviathan prestige yesterday.
---
Unfortunatelly i already had 2 of them.
---
Dude.
---
Cabbages would have offered better resistance than the other team. 
---
actually dlc's are p2w
---
I bet that other team was PISSED.
---
Hunter and hunter without stomp🙄
---
I think it’s the curated one, I have the same one and it’s great for pvp 
---
Too plain, and it looks like he's wearing Mary Jane shoes. He looks like a quaker, lol
---
You should have already picked up a bunch of quest steps that lead to exotics by now, like the Rat King, Thunderlord, Strun, and a few others. Did you talk to all the NPCs who are emphasized on your map?
---
You can get the ones that drop randomly from Xur, a merchant who appears every Friday at a random destination by exchanging legendary shards. [www.whereisxur.com](https://www.whereisxur.com) will tell you where to find him and what he's selling every week.
---
The sniper is OK, it’s too bad they nerfed box breathing or it would be a really solid legendary alternative for people that don’t have Whisper of the Worm.
---
Tee-hee
---
My clan has become accustom to me referring to this as "The Magic School Bus Cannon"     when popping people in gambit i occasionally  them know "Mz. Frizzle would like to speak with you"
---
Yup, I've done all 3 clears for every week since I've been able too, minus a few weeks where I was just not feeling it. Finally getting it to drop was such a relief Rivensbane is the only title I've been really trying to get, I'm just one simple flawless raid away
---
Outside of doing the nightfalls 2-man, there isn’t much. They are easily doable 2-man and you can just set yourself up with easy modifiers. 
---
That’ll give you 3 different ones per week anyway as well as provide you a nice little challenge and a shot at some nightfall exclusive drops. 
---
They're all decent in certain ways. The SMG packs more of a punch than others of its type. The shotgun is phenomenal--I don't even *like* shotguns and I use it all the time. It also lights up when you fire which is cool lol. Good for aggro clearing. 
---
The hand cannon has good impact but its reload speed is absolute trash. A magazine mod can help there. I personally don't like the sniper as it jumps around too much for me but I just suck at sniping. 
---
Ill take that victory Mr. Warlock. Since you pound me in PVP :)
---
I didn't. I quit after Forsaken. I read this sub because I can only hope one day they can make some changes that can retain a player base instead of bleed it constantly. But good on you for making the literal worst argument I've ever seen. "They look at news on the game they must eat it up even though they criticized it's extremely poor management." Fantastic thought mate.
---
Someone needs to Use Jotuun in a Nyan Cat Meme....  STAT
---
Aww, love that. Are you going to do anything particular with it or just frame it in your hoop? 
---
It means the roll that bungie specifically put together to be "the best" 
---
Can we do a Jojo pose and then the menacing text comes up next to them 
---
Or something like that 
---
I would buy it
---
Do we have any 
---
SHE GONE!
---
I prefer to admire that you look like RoboCop
---
I agree in so much as blink is OP, and glide is great for areas with no enemies and no time restrictions. It has great range and utility. Warlock jump is the highest skill curve, but contains the best jump(s). It's also the only class that doesn't receive an exotic for jumping skill,(stompies, lion rampant) though transversive steps will add distance to your blink. That said a triple jump Hunter with quick fang and stompies at the same time on ten mobility is probably the best jumping in the game.
---
Yea, especially if you're hitting the crits since it's so steady. Even better if you have a Melting Point/Tether/Tractor Cannon debuff on the Primeval.
---
Ah, thanks!
---
Oh, they can cross play between themselves all day lol. But the salt fest would reach unprecedented levels if console players got matched with PC. And as a PC player, I think it'd be fucking hilarious. 
---
[Here ya go](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/a0igko/escalation_protocol_weapon_drop_schedule_updated/) Guardian!
---
Wtf, you know how saved games work right? Its been that way since the NES days. There are 3 save files in the original Legend of Zelda. By your logic if you beat the game on your first save file and get all the weapons it should be available on all 3 save files? come on dude, you bought the game just play it. I cant believe people are complaining that they are made to play a game they paid for. Like, no shit, thats why you paid for it. 
---
Ha that's hilarious. You think criticizing a game is toxic. You're literally upset at people discussing a game. That's childish. Which you don't have to be a child for that but you're not a functioning adult.
---
Gun
---
Easiest and most useful overview of the week; [https://braytech.org/this-week](https://braytech.org/this-week)
---
Sniper is this week, followed by;
---
1. All 3
---
2. All 3
---
3. Shotgun
---
4. Mp
---
5. Sniper
---
and repeating from there.
---
My clan couldn't get this, we all had the rocket launcher at 600 from leviathan and did melting point and dawn of light, but wouldn't die.  Thunderlord however worked for us, we did want to try malfeasance and rat king but everyone in my clan quit.
---
I never said i was upset? I said you were toxic. Looking through your comment history you clearly have something going on at home thats bothering you. So goodluck with that or whatever idrc but keep on trying to trigger people lol
---
Activities like these are hard to tweak once in place. I really like your suggestion and hope bungie takes into account that glory progress should not be reset. It should be an option to anyone who hits legend and resets. That reset should have special rewards to keep going with each reset.
---
Its a good campaign
---
You told me to unsub and that I'm toxic. You're upset and you throwing a fit doesn't make you look great either. And you are totally a 12 year old if you talk about 'triggering" people. Like a perfect picture of someone that watches Ben Shapiro compilations.
---
Nothing more frustrating then melting the primeval half down then watching the enemy team's health bar vanish in two seconds.
---
I love this game now.. but in 3rd person I would absolutely adore it..
---
Im 20 dude if you think you’ve made me upset you’re just dead wrong... im just killing time here lol
---
okay forgive my ignorance but can guns drop without the frames, like say i do my one frame and my friends are doing one and i tag along, do i have a chance for a curated roll?
---
doesn't have 35 dollars for a toaster I'm guessing? 
---
#WHAT'S IS UP GUYS RICK CACTUS HERE
---
Zeus like physique is as close as we're gonna get
---
I would use this to be sure
---
No one here believes you're 20
---
Dahl makes guns for professional mercs. They're heavy, accurate, and effective, assuming you're strong enough to hold one!
---
So do you get the ethereal keys only once per week? or u can farm Last wish everyday and keep getting keys to see if u get the 1k voice weapon? Noob here so dont know much about this.
---
These you tubers have way to many subscribers to even be slightly affected by these kinds of reports 
---
I'll clarify for OP that there are only 3 weapons that drop from EP - Shotgun, SMG, Sniper. At the link provided, it says "every Ikelos gun", which means it can drop all 3 of the EP weapons, but does not include the Hand Cannon or Sleeper Simulant which are also Ikelos weapons but don't drop from EP.
---
But it's still an average weapon, curated or otherwise. 
---
If you preview a shader with an exotic kinetic you can see what it looks like with the shader, claparone looks nice with calus selected
---
The ones that buy it can be out shot lmao
---
I also got mine from a non powerful hand cannon frame as well
---
too soon :( 
---
See that’s why I’m confused cause according to Bungie it’s only powerful frames that can drop them and it was bugged but supposedly they fixed it 
---
Wow dude that's rough. 
---
Meanwhile I just had my third drop. This game seems to literally only want to throw dupe exotics at me. 
---
Now if only I could dual wield it or something xD
---
Apparently there is a very small chance it drops with a none powerful frame, and a decent chance it drops with a powerful frame. But I thought it drops only when you forge the weapon and from what I can tell you weren’t on that step
---
The most OP ability in the game, the Run the Hell Away from Danger
---
I keep checking and mine hasn't worked for days.  There is no more speech response just flashing lights.  I never noticed the clan number as I use it mostly for loadouts
---
Actually I was I did forge the gun I completed the steps the day before from just doing random activities 
---
You can tell the controller players on PC and I feel really bad about beating them
---
What is this from
---
Actually it looks like a taser. 
---
You can get 3 keys every week plus the once in a lifetime extra key from the wish
---
Oh well there you go. You got it from the none powerful frame. You’ve used up your rng luck for the week 
---
Lol I’ll trade you my 20 tacheons for your ship
---
pause
---
I use my gg shot last when folks have run out of cluster bomb rocket ammo and still havnt finished the job 
---
Nice repost 100/100
---
I feel like this applies to all supers except nova bomb 😂
---
Dam, no wonder i got the sniper 3 times last night...  lol
---
I’m pretty sure they only drop from powerful ones when I got the exotic bow it was from a powerful frame 
---
Insecure people boast and beg for attention for even slightest and common achievements.  
---
The most frequent one is "look, I spent \~30 hours to level my second character from zero to max light!" (which, obviously, only shows a little bit of time spent").  
---
Oooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhh
---
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
1100 silver? SOLD.
---
what?! i meant that i didnt like the game after finishing the campaign - i was also real busy
---
Raid, Forges, Iron Banner are considered endgame activities
---
Yup, large blockers are only useful when the other team has their primeval. Otherwise you want phalanxes for boops and general nuisance and knights for maybe causing some dropped motes.
---
Are they playing with joysticks or a DDR pad or something?  That's enemy team looked like a bunch of toddlers holding a controller for the first time. 
---
Solved a frame left over from the previous week will automatically count as powerful even if it was picked up as none powerful 
---
Do you have any links or sources.  I've seen the Blood for Blood medals and crap but nothing about kills without dying.  Mostly saw kill hive stuff
---
Houndish's latest video.
---
I’m not a huge Auto Rifle fan, but my Ringing Nail with Rampage and Ambitious Assassin just eats ads for breakfast! 
---
I agree that sidearms are amazing shotgun counter and how the maps could be a source of the problem and titans in general but if a titan is running at you trying to one hit shoulder charge you with a oem overshield and shotgun rushing I feel like there are more problems which make the shotgun in a bad place.
---
all 3 characters, every week since Forsaken launched, still no ghost...
---
Me neither to be honest, but I was thinking that if auto rifles ever got some kind of buff, this is the one I had to have.
---
i chose spectral blades hunter. feels badass. great for gambit.
---
Also i would strongly recommend nova warp for Warlock for obvious reasons.
---
lmao this dude actually complaining about Ace when he's running One Eyed/Luna's/Dust Rock
---
I think you meant toaster.
---
Why didn't they just fly to Mt. Doom with the eagles?
---
Should have replied "yeah sometimes I use Telesto"
---
Shoot this is why
---
Well, yeah, so I guess that would lead back to killing him in the physical world.  Killing his ascendant form probably left no physical trace in the ascendant real while it did leave it open for Mara to do what she's up to now.
---
His physical form though got sucked away into his ascendant realm upon his death but left behind his sword, the power of his logic.  This broke down into the crystal that Eris took, that we seemingly used to craft swords, one of which is at least cannon as Shaxx wields Razelighter, but maybe she will do something else with this when we see her next, maybe even soon to help end the curse.

Running at around 65-80max while playing Destiny

***Laughs in PC***
---
Nice play Whipes. See you in the crucible tonight homie :)
---
I should also note if i take 1 step back forward left or right it completely dis-appears and goes back to normal, Just on the spot and a few others the screen stretches like in the image
---
i can confirm. just started a warlock
---
You die. And then you die again because his super is still going
---
Oh ya but sometimes you just get unlucky and hes just close enough to kill you faster than you can kill him.
---
Then again I dont have stompee so I cant say how well the hunter back peddle can be. Wish I did though because knucklehead doesnt help me with my 32 inch monitor.
---
clever. take an upvote
---
Fair enough. MOBAs like any game are based on preference. Just thought I would offer some advice if you were interested in PC based gaming.
---
Because you took a picture with your phone instead of taking a screenshot.
---
The drop rate on those things are ridiculous.
---
Fair enough i'll purchase later thanks

How did you waste your minute? 😊
---
Looooooool 
---
Making this thread lol
---
Thank you! 
---
No prob, bud. We waste enough time in orbit and running back &amp; forth to Ada anyway. 
---
If you have a rampage mod then that if not I would see how much backup mag gives you. If backup mag is minimal then a minor spec. 
---
(๑˃̵ᴗ˂̵) Thank you!

I’m missing ikelos scout you get from RNG nodes.

I just wish that helmet had random rolls. 
---
Maybe
---
Guess which exotic i'm getting next ;)
---
I feel your pain, bud. I have more playtime than you, and I’m also missing the DC shell. Gotta love that RNG. 
---
Hopefully you get it this week (or next if you’ve already done the AC’s this reset). 
---
I’m triggered
---
You weren't even first on your team
---
Next up?!  TRINITY GHOUL
---
I've done it once and the dude had a howl so it made no difference 
---
Gambit is so fucked.
---
I was triggered when I got it since it was on my first scourge clear after 45+ lw clears with no 1k ( the weapon I wanted more)
---
This is a big RIP my man, I commend your incredible playtime/dedication and your stats! Almost the same thing happened to me in D1, needed 1 ship to get everything in the game and couldn’t get it before D2. RNG is really a bitch sometimes
---
You use the rewards from the bounties to buy frames. Follow the steps the frames give  you then take them to the needed forge to complete.
---
How do i get a rampage mod?
---
You’re already in the endgame. Basically you need to start doing raids if you aren’t already. DC and raids have the best armor since they can roll enhanced perks. Raids and the forges also have some really nice weapons. 
---

fWC all day
---
Sounds good to me I'll keep you posted
---
destiny 2 companion app on mobile,  thank me later. 
---
That's a good point. 
---
I just think you reach that point where you only grind for QoL drops instead of stuff that boosts you further a bit too fast in D2. 
---
But on the other hand that's a good thing too^^.
---
I mean D2 is still a great game.
---
Lmao
---
Gambit one is from bungie events right ? The otbers are from buying stuff in the bungue store 
---
Ah, that's better. Yea I know, it'd be more useful for armor random rolls.
---
Tbh, i'd rather have you ask this. Its never to late to learn.
---
Yes you're the dickhead for taking time out of your day to kick someone down instead of trying to actually help. What exactly do you accomplish with your comment? Absolutely nothing. It was utterly useless and unneeded. 
---
Public Event loot pools are all trash anyway. The only reason to do a PE is for the flash point and maybe a couple missions or triumphs.
---
And then you want to kill bungie. I had my moments when I was very close to write bungie a hate mail because of the terrible rng that makes literally no sense
---
It is true. 
---
I'm legitimately upset there's no season 3. It's hilarious and I barely watch anime.
---
Exactly what my collection looks like 😭
---
Dude, respect!
---
don't worry they're random /s
---
ah, interesting. I didn't know they fixed that! 
---
I'm already at 650 on my Warlock and Titan, just slogging through the campaigns on my Hunter =/. But I gotta finish all the stuff up because I want to work on getting all the triumphs and complete my gear collections for all 3 classes.
---
The longer you play. The less you get. RN Jesus hates you the more you play....I don't have quite those hours but I'm over 1k. N I still don't have the shell or sparrow....n thats all i need
---
how?
---
And what are you doing exactly?
---
Ran comp solo..... Got matched up with a team of 3 guys using it ... Switched mine on... Other team left about a minute later......
---
I usually jump out of the map while looking at them. And yes I know I can be an a-hole sometimes. 
---
Got the quest from loading into the tower 
---
Not sure why some people pay everyone that I’ve looked at out of curiosity gets very expensive very fast
---
I don't think its a fix. I think they just made a loophole that hasn't been brought attention to yet

The point of invading is to deny motes using your skills. Not to get an oversheild.

You obtain 3 seeds in your travels guardian, there are 4 ways to obtain.
---
1st seed, from forsaken campaign 
---
2nd seed in the dreaming city, blind well tier 2 or higher can give a seed upon completion
---
3rd seed complete the first encounter of the last wish raid, you need pl 570 and at least 2 brain cells
---
4th possible seed: doing the Petra weekly bounty that requires blind well completions, the reward is a offering to the oracle, present the offering to the oracle engine on week 3 of the 3 week dreaming city cycle (next week) step into a portal and talk to mara sov, open chest near her throne (sometimes she isn’t near her throne to talk to her, I can’t tell you what she will say/where she is in the room until the week of, as this “live” event appears perpetual or the cycle of where she is and what she says possibly lasts an entire year)
---
No but their new I figured they would find that out later.
---
I grabbed the big edition of D2 with the bag and in the Cabal collectables it has a photo of the size of Leviathan, it's so big it would indeed have an atmosphere, like #holy fuck is this bitch lasagna big
---
That can be seen as douchey when someone doesn’t understand the reference. Looks cool but just saying in case someone bumps you on purpose :p
---
The rng is keeping you from being cancer for as long as it can.
---
?
---
I suggest using a counterbalance mod. It has a pretty bad recoil pattern. The mod makes a big difference. 
---
Actually people do not want a point system based on Elo. Iron Banner is that way now and in no way is it popular whatsoever. 
---
Dude, have you checked out AoS with Rasmussen Clan? It's got that Gambit vibe. #Rasmussen~~Klan~~Clan
---
Holy fuck!! That is incredible.  You should post to Bungie’s twitter !!
---
I'm confused, did you attached the wrong video or? I didn't see anything about shotguns
---
I think your mistaken. In the title you said shotguns, but in reality it was a sidearm that killed you. Common mistake
---
Same, but with screebing Ursa Furiosa.
---
I hope you find it soon, bröther.

Shit. Only exotic piece of armor I've had drop for my Titan is that one eyed skull helmet. That's it. The rest won't drop for me at all.
---
eternal blazon with the calus selected shader
---
'Attempt'. Looks like a no scope headshot to me.
---
Oooooh. Haha that's new, all he needs is a Luna on the other foot and he's set
---
Makes sense, thanks!
---
it was the eternal blazon and coup lol
---
Xur shows up in two days. If you have most of the exotics then the chances you'll get it are good.
---
