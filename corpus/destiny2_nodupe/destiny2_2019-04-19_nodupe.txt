I see literally no reason why they wouldn't. I'm pretty certain that's just a reason they put out just so they didn't say "Cuz we don't want you on them."
---
---
---
In regards to the grinding one of the vendors gives you "welfare" gear that takes you to 640 light. And with Xur now selling forsaken exotics it's pretty easy to catch up
---
Thanks! Kinda what I figured and the fact that they don’t look that good explains why I don’t see them everywhere.
---
Holy cow so I'm not the only one who's thought about this! I can understand why there aren't any as it's hard to make a cloak, mark, or bond "important" and effective enough to warrant the exotic slot, but on the other hand, I could see the value in exotic class items that buff regen rates and mobility/resilience/recovery etc and would love an exotic that works across all subclasses rather than just one.
---
So give us the competitve triumph as completed then. I'm not grinding for shit that they fucked up on.
---
I just ran this with Well of Radiance and Phoenix Protocol, i just popped the rift as soon as ads came in, empowered, and spammed nades.
---
The crucible team literally doesn't exist, not sure you have a point
---
That's never stopped anyone.
---

---
Especially Yoko Taro.
---
The fuck this trash game edition
---
For your edit 2 I can give a few times.  D1 thorn, d1 autos, nova warp nerfed, one eyed mask, telestos  explosive range and damage, shotgun range, shards of galanor, up soon is spectral blades, proximity grenades, d1 throwing knives, pulse grenades, sword ammo on pick up, and invis not breaking tracking are the first things popping into my head
---
F
---
And now they do literally nothing, they could have just made it like skull, and now they don't work at all
---
Oh man that’s terrible
---
I won’t be trying for another week I need to recover
---
Oh I know, telestos been my go to gun since it came out, but the nerf  to its blast radius hurt a little
---

---
It's definitely a slog. You don't lose any progress for loses so you can still probably make some progress. I got most of my resets by grinding during extra valor time though and during iron banner where i win a much larger percentage of games because i am not that good at pvp.
---
Well. Good thing I got those triumphs out of the way already. Working on grenade kills in gambit and gambit prime.  Thatll be triumph #7
---
Inspect the gun and you can infused weapons with a higher attack into it to raise its attack
---
Thanks.
---
**throw more nades**
---
Oh ya, the guy asked for what got nerfed, I gave it to him. I love pvp, and loved a lot of the balancing changes, some might have hit a little too hard like the nova warp nerf, but I agree with having most things adjusted
---
Welcome.
---
Look everyone! He’s a phony!
---
Happy cake day! Also, show me on the Cayde doll where Destiny touched you.
---
If youre on xbox ill run it with you real quick
---
I can’t tonight
---
That really sucks I feel bad for you. 
---
Fyi you have to do it solo anyways it can't be done with a fireteam. I'd highly recommend you watch a video on it for the end part.
---
Aw heck man, if you ever need a guy ill help
---
Is there an easy revelry unlimited grenade build for warlocks? Seen Hunter and Titan builds around but nothing for us magic bois yet.
---
Thanks man
---
Thanks, I have watched a solo video
---
Titan could still punch away a titan from the ammo
---
There is also another synergy that turns a gun into the Thunderlord
---
You don't play pvp to be fair, you play it to be powerful, and to kill a lot of shit as fast and fun as you can. All of those hit playstyles, ways to do stupid stuff, the epic moment of having 9 blade barrages in ep throwing infinite supers, or the time you clutched a boss fight by unloading a full round of a shotgun into its chest. Having non stop health and overshield from one eyed mask when screwing around with rat king in gambit, or using an infinite pulse nade build loadouts be messed up cause it was abused in pvp fucking sucks.
---
Someone's salty tonight? If you're from D1 you're a vet by definition. Doesn't matter which era. Although I do get your point, most of the people who were here for ROI were always here since before.
---
Try sunbracers or Nezaracs sin
---
Just got the catalyst yesterday randomly in strikes...doubles the blast radius
---
Woah! I hope I get that soon too !
---
After that you need to grab a bounty from eva
---
In order for me to get arbalest I was on the triumph that required you to get orbs in strikes so I went into the reservoir nightfall strike solo then hopped on my sparrow and did public events and lost sectors everywhere. This method should work with this also
---
It doesn't.
---
I don't have that either. It's like I never used the essence
---

sooo, did i win?

Good, ty
---
Check your character screen. Make sure you have the buff from it maybe?
---
Idk man  you say that now but wait til you match up against a team of hunters running DS with chaperone/arbalest and lunas/NF
---
Can’t read anything
---
System?

Meanwhile I don’t have an arbalest

I'm more than happy to post specifics with shaders if this tickles your pickle
---
Triumphs and Bounties associated with Revelry orb generation may be completed in Quickplay Crucible playlists, Strikes, Patrols, Black Armory Forges, and the Verdant Forest.
---
As amazing as 38 kills is, your team lost a ton of motes.
---
Dude I've reached heroic 1 THREE TIMES to no avail trying to solo recluse
---
Yet we got Lord Felwinter blowing away Ghosts in his book. Like wtf.
---
Abyssal whip to a kraken tentacle? Nice. Those charges will run out though. Kind of a waste of gold.
---
Now this is just great strategy and ultimate evil wrapped in one. Drifter approves
---
For the orbs, you have an option we’re to generate them. I just did the vast majority in forges
---
It's pretty much the same idea but holstering weapons would be a nice little touch while exploring. Of course it doesn't make much sense to put one's gun away in a looter shooter c':
---
You can disable a ghost with anything just not kill it. Kinda like how sagira got KO'ed but was able to revive same with the scattered "dead" ghost in d1 when you activate them they turn on and teleport away. As far as anyone really knows sundance is the first recorded ghost being actually killed. This guy explains it better. https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/251193960?sort=0&amp;page=0
---
Thank you! Them damn skip granades got me thinking outside the box lol
---
Especially with people running around in QP with Luna or Not Forgotten, Dust Rock and Wardcliff
---
Yep, Titan is a moon of Saturn. It's the only celestial body we know of with stable bodies of liquid on the surface, which are its methane lakes. The methane is what contributes to the blue colour. If you notice the rains on Titan, that's because its methane cycle is equivalent to Earth's water cycle.
---
Except the trip mines aren't nearly as user friendly
---
Good dog on the field, bring a treat!  :D
---
Only 3 clicks? No wonder it doesn’t work lol
---
I knew I needed to get this game
---
*Laughs in shax
---
I did like seven clicks.
---
Even in Destiny, railgun beats everything.
---
Lol need more than that. Destiny jesus didnt hear your click loud enough
---
Same, first time i ran the forest, we get to 23, and the 3rd guy left like at 9th wave. We absolutely wrecked the bosses, beat them all and Geomag          stabilizers     dropped   from one of the chests
---
My response to 90%  of this games' content unfortunately. 
---
I love the series but I just can't compel myself to come back to D2 anymore. Maybe I will after a break, but for now I'll just be watching lore vids.
---
Sadly that's how it works
---
I guess so :P
---
I'll throw my ghost at them, they'll never see it coming.
---
Yo say hi to the FBI for me when they raid your house
---
Hello Velumbra 2.0
---
Is d1 still active at all? I've been thinking of redownloading to see my old character and try out rise of iron as I never played it
---
After theirbm data hovering discovery, I refuse to reinstall the epic launcher on my PC.
---
If D3 is an Epic release, I will not be buying it.
---
May be not maybe
---
they blacc, they go pop-pop
---
good percc
---
ada no like u
---
but then do
---
is nice
---
I agree
---
It's what i miss MOST
---
Was this made in paint.
---
Because it looks like it was made in paint.
---
I was just thinking about this
---
How is that clutch? Your team had 2 more lives and he just wasted his super on you
---
Powerful gear. Anything that get you powerful gear. Check the drifter for the power increase bounties. Its a slow grind.
---
So any of the daily bounties will increase my level slowly?
---
They dont have time to explain what they dont have time to explain...
---
Sent
---
This used to be a glitch in D1 aswell. You’re invisible to everybody and you can only damage people with your abilities.
---
If you are referring to the daily and weekly bounties from crucible/gambit/strikes; then yes that will help
---
this sounded very enthusiastic lol
---
Love that grenade spam in the background.  Thanks, Eva!
---
Colony, nice, I love grennade launchers and snipers!
---

---
Ever heard of dragon shadow with top nightstalker? invis with more speed
---
I got these two and almost all of the Warlock's exotics exactly after returning to the game Jan this year. I didn't even knew what Geomags were for cause I hadn't even unlocked the subclass back then.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
No wonder why I can't get 1k voices now. I've depleted my luck for the whole year
---
You did the right thing
---
Storm grenades + strikes with grenadier are the best. Played with a friend last night and didn't fire a single shot for the entire pyramidian. Literally everytime you finish throwing one you have another ready.
---
Hopw your lucky
---
I got them last week, Xur gave me SOG, got Liars from a gambit match I spawned in on at the end of match. Lucky afternoon.
---
Mara
---
Aww Destiny is filled with such great people, what a wonderful community...except for everyone *I* meet.
---
sad but true
---
I finally got them a few days ago from some god among dregs that dropped it for me in gambit
---
To be fair, I mostly dont use it myself aswell. Everytime I try to communicate via chat with ppl, they won't notice or just ignore it anyway. It's rare that someone reads chat in a strike or something else, and actually answers or reacts to it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
To be fair, I miss a lot of chat stuff aswell - since it fades away so quickly, and when you are in combat you probably wont even notice that someone wrote in chat.
---
Why not? It’s a better exotic I believe. But people are figuring out how to use it some I’m glad to see it getting used.
---
Looks really cool tbh
---
I just want rift back 😕
---
So been gone for a while.
---
So theres an event. And the ornaments dont even stay...? What is the point then?
---
If you don’t like grinds, I’m afraid you likely won’t get your moneys worth on Y2
---
Not under Activision. Here's to hoping Destiny 3 blows every other game out of the water with Bungie solo publishing.
---
Me when I see ‘Last Guardian Standing’
---
It’s active all week now.
---
Were going to see glimpses of the new enemy race in season of opulence, this is confirmed by anonthenine. Wether that be in the raid or towards the end of the story the game gives us. Should be quite interesting to see though
---
Nah I dont hate grinds. Just too many games, not enough time is all. Playing apex, ff14, then playing other games for fun like ssbu. 
---
I enjoyed d2 y1
---
So far I'm using thunderlord. Especially in strikes its pretty useful and the boss is down if everyone has it haha
---
We don't do that here
---
That bond brothers one was bonded to me, I never took it off.
---
Titan helmet from the Alak-Hul strike. Best Taken King strike, imo.
---
Dude, you are sleeping so hard man. Get that Frosty's with Perpetuation and stack 5 paragon mods. Only time you're visible is when you dodge.
---
Lol good joke
---
The event is shit though.  Running thru the forest is mind numbingly boring
---
Just spray and pray lmao
---
I'm at 700 and I'm constantly against damn 4 stacks. (Solo)
---
Can never win more than two games in a row before my entire team ends up drowning in sweat.
---
I'm currently on the last step and this is simply annoying. Not even fun at this point.
---
Once (or if) I get get Luna, I'm out of Comp. Permanently.
---
I love this event, this is awesome for a casual player like me
---
Rampage spec
---
Ah the good ol tentacle gauntlets.
---
Spiked outrageous fortune with velocity perks
---
pure rng, they are VERY rare.
---
Nah id rather look like a boeing 787
---
I disagree fundamentally its grenade spamming fun time yes I get skipped a bunch but I'm spamming my own nades and having a fun time. It's like mayhem-light. I mean I get it that it may not be the intense gun down experience some pvp players want but a great deal of us are having fun. Ruining is the opposite of how I feel, in fact, I'm having some of the most fun in pvp I've had in awhile.
---
I didn't use the boost. I talked to Tyra just now and she has nothing for me
---
Perhaps....
---
Kono
---
Did you try talking to failsafe on Nessus?
---
Hate to break it to ya, but the maulers took up your entire screen with the huge plates when fan firing.
---
This whole game I've been wondering why these were replaced with the nf strike exclusives. It would only incentivise people to make strikes actually drop worthy loot rather than the same mediocre roll over and over again
---
*bank those motes and you'll summon a primeval*
---
Gets hit by 3 knights, 5 captains and 18 goblins at once
---
*Everyone lost all the motes!*
---
Could be worse but I agree
---
Wouldn’t call it a big carry but ok
---
Well it’s a bit more expensive but nothing different than D1 here x)
---
Which servers do you play on? Can anybody join them? On my server I'm constantly treated in an intimate way against my will by pulses, jotun, snipers and grenade launchers.
---
As long as it's not Hive. I hate them because it's just an endless parade of wizards and shriekers.
---
US servers, I live in the southern part of the USA
---
Look at the picture again. Take note of the rank.

---
I know, im loving it too.
---
Made it on whatsapp lmao. Thought it was ok enough to post here
---
It most likely falls on the cpu power not the gpu power destiny is a high fidelity game and it has background processing going on that makes it hard to run on current gen consoles
---
took a break, 93/100
---
That concept art has always been there since D1 released

I’m down
---
Muchly aporeciated my good sir :)
---
Prepare for the sea of salty PvP players that are about to down vote you lol
---
They're exactly who I'm talking to, all good.
---
New nerf: momentum is turned up to 10000% so everytime you swing you accelerate to the speed of mach 7 and crash into the nearest wall or death area
---
I think there are others of The Nine's race outside the solar system and the evil ones are coming to kill us. The Nine love geometric shapes and spheres WAY too much for this not to be a thing.
---
Nice reference! Thanks for bringing up the emotional scars this left me with...
---
Lul I wish, 20 or so runs and still no Anarchy
---
To be fair you had a week to get it done, its not like they pulled the rug out from under you completely out of no where. Also I'd recommend a pulse rifle, hanging back and sticking with the team as much as possible, its the best way to progress that step.
---
This isn't an LFG sub.

Check our LFG thread on the sidebar, and also the Team-up Tuesday megathread on /r/DestinyTheGame. (It's pinned on their sidebar.)
---
What happened to "Xur can now sell random rolled exotics"?
---
Is this format a thing now?
---
PLEASE. I loved Rift! They could also bring back 3v3 while they’re at it
---
I am at the NF quest and only have 3%
---
He’s selling some damn good exotics, the problem is that everyone already has them
---
It was a general statement
---
The first mission was really cool because it felt almost surreal fighting with Zavala in the center of the tower where we spent countless hours just chilling out.
---
Boy why wasn't destiny 2 an add on to d1
---
I'm hoping they fix warlock and hunter armour first :/ looks so naff rn
---
I can't believe they put blues in that loot pull. SMH
---
Have you read The Most Loyal lore book? It was Variks who set up the prison break for Uldren and Fikrul.  Variks then took off into the universe with some other fallen to find the Kell of Kells. He is partly responsible for Caydes death. Ironic considering it was Variks who gave the Ace of Spades to Cayde and hired him to hunt down Fikrul in the first place.
---
bash brothers - kill one, get exotic, three of coins, kill the other, exotic. didn’t happen often, but it couldn’t anywhere else.
---
Congrats! Working on mine now.
---
This was pretty entertaining. Good job man.
---
wrong blades
---
Yes 40 strikes
---
I miss the hunter cloaks
---
Not forgotten
---
Just do lost sectors, those are 100%
---
thanks cap!
---
No problem cap!
---
Are u on ps4 we could stream a riven cheese with nades that would be hella funny

Have a close buddy hop on your account and get it for you

Xur Review!
---
Xur is our daddy this weekend. Buy literally anything that he has that you don't have.
---
Wardcliff: amazing dps especially with arc singe
---
Raiden Flux: arcstrider is in a really good place now so buy it. It has no drawbacks
---
Hallowfire heart: who doesn't like having super quick grenades and hammers when you have super? Plus it looks amazing, buy it.
---
Lunafaction: does this even need to be said? If you don't have it, BUY IT RIGHT THIS SECOND GUARDIAN.
---
tl:Dr - buy it all but prioritize Lunafaction, Wardcliff, Raiden Flux then Hallowfire.
---
(if I'm wrong about anything or something isn't as good as it seems please just comment and let me know so I could change it :))
---
While doing Mystery and Potential 1, I noticed that the gold-like metal on the floor where the chest appears shows the Guardian's footprints. Further investigation showed me that the foley for walking across it sounds like crunching snow.
---
Maybe. DM me so we can discuss it further.
---
1400 hours in, +500 hours after Forsaken and I'm more then happy. No regrets from my side.
---
It's not perfect and has a lot of problems, but those tend to be on the smaller side.
---
Spray paint

I recently completed the **Thunderlord** quest, and got **Two-Tailed Fox** from a Gambit game. Unfortunately, I had Thorn as my only Kinetic for a while so I couldn't use either, but now I have a 665 Scout Rifle, so I can switch in between.

WoW died at the end of Wrath. Once they introduced instant-queue dungeons and later raids in Cataclysm, the social aspect of the game died. It stopped being a game you HAD to cooperate with people in order to experience content, to a game you can solo queue for shit and ah, damn, there's also people in it.
---
People who claim WoW's somehow become BETTER only deal in shinies and gimmicks and know nothing about the MAGIC that made MMO's something special back then. City of Heroes/Villains, Ultima, V-WoW, Everquest, fucking RUNESCAPE, all shit on Destiny, modern WoW, and any other MMO out there.
---
The ONLY MMO on the market today that still captures the old spirit of what an MMO is supposed to be is EVE Online, and that's only because it's been going for 20 years.
---
Get off my lawn.

Maybe guardians are just the fattest people to ever exist

This Twice format is spreading. Feels good
---
See this was the only time I was ok with giant ass Titan shoulders, when we had giant ass forearm armor to go with it so we look actually protected, it’s why I love the Titan gambit prime shoulders so much, because our forearms are actually armored

The last two yes, but not the first one

I'm on mobile so I couldn't explain everything I wanted. But just message me if you have any doubts. There is also some subreddits that can be accessed on the right side which have people discussing crucible tips, builds and other stuff and I suggest you maybe browse it

We are on reddit. How mature is the average redditer.
---
is that beta riven in development or just a really bad glitch

since when is 120? when i googled how much it was per reset it said that it was something like 60 when you are at heroic
---
Beta Riven
---
No one knows about the No Feelings.
---
Box Breathing, Rapid Hit, Meyrin RDL, Range MW.
---
Can 3 tap a guardian at any range with 3 crits + Box Breathing, gives it the same TTK as Luna's/Not Forgotten. Absolutely underrated and a monster in both PvE and PvP.
---
After you unlock the service revolver from Zavala then you have a chance to obtain turning in vanguards with random rolls. Depending on the roll, it can keep up/out perform Luna’s howl
---
You’ve never seen a wayfarer?? Their everywhere
---
admit it, it could have been so much better, Breakneck had a secret perk built into Onslaught, why couldn't Oxygen at the least have some sort of Triple Tap built in?

Looks like an iced Starbucks matcha latte coming from an ex barista
---
Wait, Breakneck has a secret perk? I just got it like, yesterday.
---
the higher the Rampage stack the faster the reload

never

not my favorite...but remembering the first time hearing the Sepiks music in the beta makes it really hard not to love it the most.
---
fav would probably be Echo Chamber for the Eyasluna farm.
---
That sub is so hot right now
---
best part is you just need a single kill to load two into the chamber. (as long as you have the ammo in reserves)
---
More mature than you.
---
I...did not know this, but it means it’s now going to be my go-to kinetic primary. Still gonna use Oxygen as my secondary if I’m running special kinetic. Dragonfly spec and meganeura are just so...crispy

In crucible it's not that important unless your team drags only by a small margin in which case yes, you are contributing to that gap. Though if you have 10 deaths in total and your team is 10 points behind it doesn't mean your contribution to that is 100%, it's rather \~50% because your teammates die as well (and it's not like it's possible to reduce 10 deaths to zero). The crucible is as much about not dying to enemy team as it is about killing it. If you play safe you are already doing some good, especially if you land assists.

It's purely location based. We have no data to prove that there is or isn't lobby balancing either.
