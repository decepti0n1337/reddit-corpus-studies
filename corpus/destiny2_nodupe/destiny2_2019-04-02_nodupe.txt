it just lasts so long with the giswin vest. It feels like you can hunt down and wipe the whole team twice over with it. 
---
r/warlocksglideup ?
---
Yeah me too, but they take skill to proc
---
you can rerun lvl 1 over and over again to clear the quest. this week is smg week iirc, not many people interested in farming that so getting to lvl 7 is difficult. 
---
Huh?
---
The “look at my gun” guy
---
Oh boy another DRB in crucible...sigh....its core terminus that has the highest drop rate. 
---
#YEAH BUT THEN YOU'RE PLAYING THE GAME WITHOUT A SUPER.
---
The last word was invented in like the 1800s 
---
fated engrams don't contain forsaken exotics yet. maybe next season they will but for now they don't. the only way is to wait and pray he sells whatever exotic you're missing. 
---
Take my likes 
---
Happened to me too. Was very surprised an glad at the same time.
---
I like.
---
And I hate everything.
---
Thank you very much!
---
Imagine using Nova Warp in PvP when you could be using *literally any other warlock super*
---
Hate me if y’all want, but I fucking hate Shaxx with a passion
---
might not be aimbot, machineguns in general are broken in pvp, they're too damn accurate and way more forgiving than queenbreaker ever was. not to mention the ammo count.
---
Nova warp then Mobius quiver. For real who uses that garbage?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Hmm, I had also heard that he had a better drop rate but good point
---
Nice super! Woooo the infamous "cant wait a little longer for the match to end quitter".
---
They also work with Arcstrider melee as long ass you have a melee charge.
---
Lol yeah
---
10/10 Video 
---
Still get more chances to use it than a super.
---
Well good luck, and just to make sure you know, I'm pretty sure you have to wait until reset and then grab the bounty and complete it. I could be remembering wrong, but I want to say you can't carry over the bounty or offering and get in
---
Arcstrider melee isn't 1 hit KO is it? 
---
Probably true about the drop rate to. I tried once with sloan on titan and didn't get near the amount of cores, mods and shards back. 
---
I totes agree with that. My argument was using a hunter super as an argument against the strength of a titan melee ability isnt a fair comparison. Ya dig?
---
Me: MOSCOW MOSCOW 
---
Well then, in case you haven't heard already, Xur has a chance of selling Forsaken exotics now. His Fated Engram is still only year 1 gear for now. 
---
Yes. 
---
/s
---
Aonly thing I got out of this is I need Not Forgotten, I want my Luna's to be a rangey boi. 
---
You don’t have skull of dire?
---
Ooft dude, check my posts to see what that bad boi can do.
---
Good
---
Yeah I plan on testing other vendors at some point but I just spent 20+ minutes of straight clicking so I don't intend to for a little while.
---
Yet I STILL can't aim for shit.
---
&gt; stop talking to me you deluded hypocrite.
---
Can’t lie tho, I subbed to both channels
---
woah thats a lot of downvotes for a simple emoji
---
I'm so jealous, that looks badass man
---
[removed]
---
the destiny logo is in the bottom right
---
Dust rock blues, nf, ward cliff. So how's playing crucible on easy mode? 
---
The invis and wallhacks alone is way stronger than one shot melee 
---
Now this does put a smile on my face 
---
This is incredible. Does the ghost light up?
---
If ya can’t beat them join em
---
Just put on a video and mash the button, whole thing takes like 10 minutes (for my 1400 L Shards at least)
---
Is this just for solo play? I don't understand the direction here. It seems like gear was chosen thematically as opposed to damage potential/efficiency/party buffs. Weapons are there own meta entirely and are largely independent of subclass for most activities. The armor choices are quite odd as well with there being no insurmountable skullfort, skull of dire ahamkara, one eyed mask, stompees or phoenix protocol which are largely essential exotic pieces for high level play. You've also suggest Arbalest which isn't even in the game yet.
---
Thought it was a giant torchick in its shell...
---
I just opened up the dreaming city tonight after taking a long break from D2... so seeing your post made me smile.  Incredible job!
---
Well I got over 2000 and don't want to get arthritis. Just thinking with all this "21st century" technology that there must be some way to use a macro on a console.   
---
Currently thinking I might download REWASD and attempt to use it on my windows 10 that is stream destiny from my console...
---
I’ve gone the opposite direction. I put he new season 6 Atlantis shader on my warlock now he just looks like captain America 
---
I came here to say that very thing!  
---
Is that really what recoil is like on PC? 
---
Also how come the traveler did not crash into earth when it went dormant? Did it know how to still float while sleeping, like a shark.
---
Try repairing files through the bnet and then check your gpu drivers.
---
Oh that I bought that in season 3 so I can get the random rolls now, just got one recently with rampage and some other non-amazing perk. I hear the 40 strike completions one is the better one however.
---
You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.

Tell that to the hive lmao

time to play run from the soyboys
---
they should make a gamemode where we have to try not to die to a team of sb
---
This format will be relevant for the rest of time
---
As a hunter main, part of me wonders how many accidental teabags/squats I've performed forgetting my dodge isn't off cool down. 
---
just 4 stack with your clan or buy a acc recov if u suck at pvp that much.
---
Look on the bright side, you actually got an exotic to drop.
---
Varies actually, sometimes 5 mins, sometimes 30 mins. But if you keep doing it you might be banned for a day
---
I've learned to go with the flow, but also to know what fights I shouldn't pick. For example, my aim's pretty decent with an AoS but if there's someone with a good HC like Luna then I just avoid facing them head-on. If you can't take 'em in a fair fight, you gotta play dirty as much as you can. Given your disorder a grenade launcher may be just the thing for you; I've had good results with the current IB one.   
---
Your experience will differ but I hope this helps.
---
I feel like this is because of me and I love it. 
---
That sleeper tho 
---
Uldren corrupted the ether. 
---
From normal drop sources, yes, but I wasn't sure how it would behave with a patrol chest
---
Everything is behind a paywall now! 
---
Full sized for Scourge of the Past. The other one is still a couple months from dropping. 
---
And I certainly wasn’t go to go down without a fight!!! Ajax would be proud of me 
---
Real Genius! Awesome flick! :)
---
How is it enemy themed? I genuinely can't tell.
---
There are, but again the prices are kind of inflated and it's usually more mainstream stuff, things like Harry Potter and Game of Thrones. The only place I can get Destiny funkos is off Amazon, where the prices are extremely whack (think 4-5 times the actual USD price- I saw a Cayde Funko going for roughly 90-100 USD the other day). Still, there are sales occasionally, so I'm just waiting for the right time xD
---
(That, and pestering friends/relatives stateside lol)
---
Crucible sweat, am I right?
---
fuck that bully him 
---
r/warlocksriseup
---
It's got the Scorn design. Which also lore wise could fit into the weapon as Queenbreaker is Fallen and Scorn were once Fallen.
---
Yup yup, they do. The eyes are shaped differently though, so it doesn't look this horrifying.
---
I should’ve done that. “IM TAKING MY OWN WAY OUUUUUUUUUT!”
---
So fucking worth it
---
✊
---
Those are rookie numbers I have killed the hole enemy team four times in one super it was just stupid
---
I’m hyped for when they release volume 2
---
it’s still good on bosses with a lot of health. sucks on groups of enemies though. 
---
r/yesyesyesno ?
---
Thank you, I appreciate that. I appreciate you.
---
Telesto is the besto for envoys!! 
---
Or how about when the titan clearly does fat before contact and the shoulder charge just goes through anyways?
---
I did around 100 tokens and got 3, it's just pure RNG
---
I agree
---
Hey, I'm actually in this one! Hahaha
---
I dont know why people keep repeating what i already said i agree with as a response to my comments.
---
Pretty awesome
---
Wasn't IT to all Legendary Edition owners?
---
Your path keeper change is exactly what was broken about them on release. The increase just didn't work.
---
Talk to the Drifter and open the second page, it should be there
---
Like the Han Solo and Tauntaun of the Destiny universe &lt;3
---
yes, but they took a shortcut to "fix" it
---
Just like vanilla ice totally did not rip off David Bowie’s beat
---
Ada isn't helping anyone with anything lol. Might even give you the wrong answers out of spite. 
---
Well played sir
---
yeah I just got comm banned for asking a dude why he was teabagging me instead of revivng me in gambit ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Good on you guys. I don't know of this exists, but is it possible for the match to end in a tie? If yes, I think teams in this situation should just let the match end that way. Win win for everyone
---
Some people just can't handle the fact that they suck at this game. People have reported me for destroying them in PvP . I never T bag or anything . I just have a good match and people report me for it lol
---
For people who dont understand
---
This is Russian Vostok League. A tournament for destiny on PC. It has really dumbass rules and basically its shit.
---
It’s because he’s secretly a worm god and needs fed by death.

Weirder things have happened I suppose.

Spider should have it

Except when this happens to me and it’s stronghold

My God roll Hammerhead: BRRRT
---
Oh sweet brother or sister.. that was mine until last week.. try spamming comp, I got two exotic drops from playing it. 
---
You can look on things like LFG but the thing is, since you don’t have access to most activities and are such low light level, a lotta people aren’t gonna want to play with you. Basically everyone on the fireteam services own the dlcs.
---
Yes
---
it doesnt mean it cant be changed again 🤷‍♂️
---
How did you talk to the other team?
---
Unless I’ve played games where the other team has never, ever talked, I’ve only been able to talk with my own teammates 
---
I killed both knights and the final boss
---
Ah yes, because Blade barrage and arc staff are so useless /s
---
Sat over here with only one viable super in crucible 
---
First of all; it’s really easy to avoid someone coming at you with SB (if you see them coming), yeah it lasts long but so does bottom tree striker. So get over it— Nothing needs a nerf. it’s called balance. 
---
Oh stfu.
---
Got an annihilation in comp like that the other night. Last round of countdown, 5 to 5, rounded the corner popped tether on the guy planting the charge, caught all 4 and then my teammate dropped a nova on them. Gotta love orpheus rigs 
---
Sounds nice
---
&gt; teammates are killing ads for no reason
---
Loading up on special/heavy ammo.   
---
Can’t use that heavy ammo if you don’t get past wave one :/
---
Triple down, one way or another. 
---
this is how i got those handcannon headshots at 3.am
---
Thanks for reading :)
---
that's max level yeah
---
same, thought he's gonna pull a sick move..
---
What? He's faulting the match making not the game mode, no one wants to get teabagged by those lanky dudes
---
👍🏽
---
accurate 
---
titan wall to block the shots, warlock well and overshield to survive the dunk
---
Idk i guess the title ticked me off a little based on how its worded. Also im pretty sure lightlevel advantage is disabled in qp so its not the most broken thing 
---
I feel bad for people who are affected so strongly by something so insignificant.
---
spending half a game running from sb is not fun. either it should not get duration boosts from kills, should be shortened, or shouldn't have the mobility that it does. 
---
I have never seen anyone as triggered as this. See ya dickhead.
---
missile melee isn‘t oneshot though
---
Now that is what you call commitment.
---
That’s completely wrong
---
Wittle baby gotta scream triggered. Awww. Wittle baby gonna go cry. Adorable. Too bad it's still over an ornament. See ya pussy boy.
---
You literally get it the same way always, y’all need to look this up, pinnacle weapons never go away 
---
But seriously... 6 hours? Good job!
---
A well deserved upvote. 
---
Wow...😳👍
---
Throwing knives on the way of a thousand cuts tree are better. thats my main reason 
---
The Trials Scout Rifle "Purpose"
---
And his son, Swolo Ren. 
---
They net the same damage 
---
Iron.  
---
But yea losing 95% of my health from a thrall melee was one hell of a wake-up call
---
He also has a bounty called "Electri-fried" to get Arc kills in Gambit, and it says:
---
&gt; *Hey, what smells so good?* - The Drifter
---
Thanks. I've only had Destiny for some months, so I'd never seen it and was wondering. Anyways, sick 4k. 
---
Holy crap. What's your PL OP? I tried this with 3 people and we got smacked around lol (675 ish).
---
You get more once you are over level 50. The highest drop rates for them are from anything that drops powerful gear which isn’t a relevant thing until you are over that mark. 
---
If you only have the base game, powerful drops are pretty limited and that cap will start down at level 20. 
---
Be sure to check in with Xur every week. He will bring a weapon and an armour piece for each class as well as a fated engram which is guaranteed to drop a year 1 exotic you don’t already own. Buy whatever exotics he is selling directly before buying the fated engram. He arrives on fridays at reset and leaves tuesdays at reset (just over two hours from now). Check whereisXur.com if you are looking for him. 
---
Could also do the year 1 leviathan raids if you wanted to. They have a decent drop rate from encounter chests and each have hidden chests that have a 1/3 drop rate for exotic engrams (though they are limited to year 1 exotics). 
---
How many medals did you get from that?
---
Oh how I miss the dinklebot. 
---
What was your load out?
---
Neither is the god roll. God roll would be full choke/accurized/opening shot/slideshow/range MW. The curated from last season has everything except opening shot, but OP’s lacks the range masterwork. Personally, I’d still take the opening shot one just from seeing what a difference it makes on the curated Mindbender’s. 
---
Probably thinking D1 if you played that
---
Hahahahaha, suck shit, giant robot!
---
Not at all. I understand that the best way to win is loads of practice, using the meta weapons, playing in a fireteam etc. To use your analogy, in wondering why NBA players want to team up and whoop my ass in a Rec league 😂 surely it's less fun for really good people to squash noobs than to have a competitive experience with like minded and more equal players?
---
Pretty much. Idk I just found it kind of funny. Guess that is only me 
---
First off, this post is free of salt, as I love Destiny (always have) and want it to be better, and the point of the post is to do just that. The only salt is coming from your butt-hurt ass, so quit projecting.
---
Second up, that Division stuff is all rumors and hearsay. Bungie is known for creating the console competitive multiplayer formula, and I doubt they'll ditch PvP altogether. Also, PvP hasn't been breaking PvE, as they work in different ways. PvP favors consistent damage and survivability, whereas PvE favors maximum damage output. Example: shotguns vs snipers. Totally different meta. PvP being removed wouldn't add anything, it would just be a loss of a relatively simple thing to implement.
---
Also, none of that has shit to do with the class trees being dumb'd down. That's to make the game simpler for casual players, which is a consistent flaw with Bungie design.
---
Third, there isn't shit to do even if you are max level, which is the reason I haven't felt the need to level up; it's fucking pointless. a goddamn number that means nothing, except that I can now do activities easily, all for more useless number pushing. There is no meaning, no nuance, no RPG mechanics other than level grinding.
---
Forge exotics? Fuck them, I already have Thunderlord/Sleeper/Spindle which completely destroys the PvE meta with raw damage output, so all those other guns are useless. Literally everything else is useless.
---
Gambit Prime gear? LOL! Fuck Gambit, so again, useless. I don't need neon bling that bad...
---
Iron Banner bounties? Useless. Also, what the fuck do I need a crappy fusion rifle for?
---
The only good remaining content is the Crucible, which I still enjoy because Bungie knows how to do gunplay (and because, unlike the AI, humans are somewhat intelligent), and the pinnacle weapons are damn good and worth the time sink. Also the raids, but I don't wanna LFG for five other players every week, especially with the recent raids not being all that great and with garbage loot.
---
Yes, I don't want a "crappy looter shooter." I want a good looter shooter, not the menial grind-fest we currently have. No, crappy is not a "subjective term", as the game's dwindling population count and terrible review scores speak for themselves.
---
Point is, the game lacks substance. PvE content is bland garbage with brain dead AI, and PvP is unbalanced as usual. The loot is either completely useless, or ridiculously OP. The game needs a restart. 
---
It needs to die for the sake of D3, and I think the majority of Destiny players will agree. I'm perfectly fine waiting for a quality product, rather than the rushed cash grab that is D2.
---

---
Black armoury dreaming city frame? Got mine from that.
---
You on Xbox ill help. Wasn't so bad.
---
Honestly the thrall were the most dangerous bit in here.
---
Personally I think you should have put the rose instead of the last word cause I heard somewhere that the thrown was just a corrupted version of the rose (makes sense right Rose's have thorns) 
---
disagree about Sekiro...it's more easier because there's no level grind to increase difficulty. at the same time, it's a bit harder because you can't over-level your character.
---
And that’s exactly what I’m saying is wrong. You shouldn’t use programs to augment you skill in a video game in order gain an advantage they don’t have. 
---
In literally every other multiplayer game with a competitive aspect mods are not allowed. Coincidence? I think not.
---
Actually they call it cheating. Use your head
---
this was the last piece of armor i needed and this is exactly how it went for me. 
---
I'd prefer if D3 not flop. What would be great is if they stop making content for D2 right now, and instead focus INTENTLY on D3. Hopefully, with more time to develop and less restrictions from Activision, D3 can be a quality product we all can enjoy.
---
I still think sekiro is a decent game tho
---
This kinda reminds me of Rezyl Azzir's legend on the moon. So here is an excerpt from the legend featuring you instead (basically just a copy of the grimoire with your name instead and to fit chasm of screams...) I imagine if Rezyl's story began in D2, this would be the strike that would lead him down the path to Dredgen Yor.
---
The trigger clicked. 
---
Another empty clip slid from its purchase and dropped to the dark stone floor.
---
It was the last.
---
His rifle was dry.
---
XP17 spun the weapon in his hand, grabbing hard around the barrel, like a club.
---
A new wave of chittering death was upon him – fragile but aggressive, overwhelming in their number and oppressive in their rage.
---
The stock of the rifle connected with skull after skull. 
---
They caved and fell.
---
Like the others before.
---
The pile of vanquished nightmares—half bone, half dust—grew at XP17's feet.
---
There was a calm to him. An ease.
---
The chaos of battle was no time to panic. 
---
His swing was wide, but measured. No wasted movement.
---
A demon clawed at his back. Then another.
---
They were heavier than their frail frames would suggest.
---
He gave a shrug and shake, turned and hammered the stock hard into the side of one creature’s temple. Its skull splintered and the stock lodged deep in the wet, chalky mass beneath the bone. He made a fleeting effort to break the rifle free, but had to let it fall away as the rush of demons increased. 
---
XP17 kicked the other monster to the floor, stepping on its neck while shifting to backhand a throng of attackers eager to make their killing lunge.
---
If the rifle—his battle-worn Inferno—had served to thin the herd and buy XP17 time to assess the whole of the situation, his Rose would see him through.
---
It always had.
---
XP17, awash in the ash and gore of his enemies, pulled his cannon and in one motion feathered the trigger to level the wretched beasts closest to him.
---
The bloom from each shot lit the cavern with flashes of red heat — a garden of angry roses blossoming in pointed defiance of this vile, hateful kingdom of shadows.
---
On the far end of the sea of gnashing maws, the wicked shrieker danced in the air.
---
Watching.
---
Waiting?
---
I know the feeling 😐
---
HOLY SHI...5:41:57    
---
 Just ran this last night with clan mates.  It was tough.  
---
We cheesed the boss battle by having a clan mate hide on a ledge where he couldn't shoot or get killed to avoid the wipe.  Even with that it was a near 2 hour, painful activity.
---
oh yeah people like me who only want the crucible to be balanced......
---
People like you are the reason bungie is considering removing PvP. Can’t make a balanced game if all these insecure people are complaint they can’t play like some streamer.
---
nope because they know better.. 
---
this isnt really a glitch its just a clever use of game mechanics and how they were programed its not like youre using a 3rd party or altering code.. its literally just inputting a buttom over and over which could also be done on console in d1. but this time around it was framerate depended and mouse has tools to let you basically mash the button faster even outside of using a macro.. bungie recognized this.. even after the fact though according to them you could even do this with macros that came with the mouse or keyboard and that was ok too, as macros are very common on hardware nowadays.
---
I didn't know that until yesterday. I felt like I discovered the wheel. Lol
---
FIGHT FOREVER, GUARDIAN!
---
You know I’d love that too. However at this point I just don’t think that will happen. Bungie said they’d communicate with us when shit hit the fan. They did. Now that it’s doing better they are pretty silent. 
---
Looks to me they do whatever until profits drop and then they listen to the consumers....
---
Lol.  I feel like we’ve all been there.  I’ve Missed that throw for sure.  
---
Ita great to pair with sniper and fighting lion.
---
u/SiezethegapYouOFB
---
Bro you need to be 651 or better at least. The thrall will absolutely destroy you. 
---
I would be cool with that too for exotics. Just something, ya know? 
---
*Nothin' personal, kid*
---
Yes I agree. I’m still waiting on shards and sixth coyote for my hunter. Gotten 3 foetracers already 
---
\*pulls out telesto and stops watching\*

This is the quality content I come to this subreddit for.

I’m 647 and I did it wit a mate who was 657 and it was not awful
---
yes its a ten paces 
---
just used it because it was my first 700 kinetic ;) 
---
Honestly, I really like the notion of exotic quests for all exotics just in case you have crap RNG. And, they should be grindy AF so folks will only do it if they really want it...
---
Locking this thread since it has dissolved into name calling, whining, and not producing thoughtful discussion. Regardless of your opinion on this topic discussion posts need to be actually discussing things in a meaningful manner. Also, if the point of this post was to discuss language used in the article the OP should've at least quoted the actual article instead of giving a incredibly biased and opinionated argument (with zero substance about the actual topic). We can do better than this guys! Please refer to the rules next time and make sure your next posts are actually trying to stir conversation instead of pointing fingers. Thanks.

I mean that sounds awesome but why remove crucible 
---
Because the pvp will be really good in open world? Again, this is just leaks. Don't freak about it

Your Titan has no neck lol

Done. Thanks for the chance guys

It's monochrome from eververse.

To everyone complaining about shoulder charge: Shotguns exist, and they are available to all classes.
---
There's the Team Up Tuesday thread on r/destinythegame what's your platform?
---
PvP Starter Kit: Luna's/NF, Dust rock and spectral blades
---
i think tether just needs a buff. more armor during the animation, tether targets instantly when it hits the ground and it should kill on direct hits like in d1.
---
Same here I think we’re both crazy 
---
I dont undertstand why nobody trusts that i know what im doing and downvotes me and assumes im an asshole. Yes i know about 3rd curse week oracle offering. I have killed kalli 2 times. And i have contacted bungie twice and not gotten a reply. I have done max curse 7 times now. My 3rd seed is gone. Forever. I just need bungie to see this. But everybody keeps thinking im a simpleton and just didnt do it right. I know what im doing. I just fucked up by not knowing my pursuits and postmaster were full.
---
Thanks! 👌
---
Yeah but you have to use a randomly dropped exotic for this to work.
---
Bottom striker.
---
Welp, another opportunity to farm for a God roll blast furnace
---
Whatever, I was trying to help. You're on your own if you want to be rude about it.
---
You should have gotten a level 30 boost with forsaken that will take you 320 power level, i would suggest doing it on a second character, i used it on my main and regretted it when i wanted to play my other two characters
---
Chaining the same word over and over again
---
What fun amirite
---
I think the drifter changed his list of items after the season released.
---
The bygone he was selling were a good one, Full auto trigger and kill clip, good barrel, fast reload mag and stability masterwork, the best I ever had (pvp wise) even if I keep a rampage and outlaw on the side  😀
---
If I have to lower myself to the level of apes to climb this mountain then so I shall.
---
Your clan sounds like a bunch of guys who wear white Oakley's.
---
&gt; They don't just pick a name out of a hat and ban people. You obviously did something to deserve it so quit whining.
---
tell that to a hundred players who've been banned in three days, what can you do that's so forbidden in this game, other than break the connection ?
---
I agree on the big amount of time we have to go through menus, but didn't noticed additional loading time...
---
I just respond with “ok pumpkin” until they get bored. My record is 3 Days. 
---
What weapon is that?
---
Not fair that you are banned for cheating? Lol
---
Umm, Nova Bomb tracking is disgusting. Nova Warp was just as bad as spectral blades is now. 
---
Titans get the real shit stick. And if you say OEM is a game changer like Nova Warp was and Spectral Blades is, well, you're wrong. 
---
Alright
---
What? Just balance them. Not nake them op

Here's to wishing the pulse makes a great comeback! I do well with distance fighting, and also get smashed up close. My suggestion is meat shields. (team shooting, let your ally jump head first into the fray, and you hang back with that pulse and get plucked shots)
---
Lmao all the babies in the comments bitching about spectral? Is it a bit too strong for a super? Yes. Is it fucking unbeatable? Hell no, maybe learn how to shoot down a spectral before it kills you, until then quit bitching about it. 
---
надеюсь тебя не забанят случайно, посмотрим что ты скажешь в таком случае
---
Yeah the armor looks cool, but how do people get 20,000 shards/40,000 bright dust? I dismantle everything I don't use and I never have more the 100 shards/1000 bright dust.
---
I will.  If they got banned they deserve it too.  And if you're talking about network manipulation that's definitely grounds for a ban.  I'm not sure you know what you're talking about.. 🤣🤣
---
I bring her all my exotic engrams.
---
Wah, now i need to think when i use my super. 
---
Just like nova bomb buddy
---
I was excited to see it too this is the first time Bungie has re sold an exotic ship in eververse from a past season without asking for real money
---
At first I was like: "That's pretty good I guess." but then I was like "Oh, oh dang, good job." 
---
&gt; I will. If they got banned they deserve it too. And if you're talking about network manipulation that's definitely grounds for a ban. I'm not sure you know what you're talking about.. 🤣🤣

ну так если не знаешь, то лучше не умничать, как думаешь ?
---
well, if you don't know, it's better not to be smart, don't you think ?
---
Tether is soooo under rated. Good clips are hella satisfying

amirite

Looks like a white oracle to me.
---
I do this a lot so I can GG and blast the boss with Acrius faster so we don't need to do that stupid chase...
---
"Done"
---
I still wish I had the ramen emote. 
---
There is is a spot he can stand where he can’t die and you can’t wipe
---
Done
---
I'm a hunter main, and I really enjoyed the clip, have my upvote my titan friend
---
(I do not play Spectral Blades btw, even if I have Gwisin Vest  😀, keeping the game enjoyable for everyone)
---
She's been away for a while now
---
It sucks all the shit you grinded for which in my case is full ornamented new monarchy and iron banner armor. Is made useless because devs think we shouldnt be able to wear y1/2 armor.
---
I logged into my PS4 account the other day which has all my y1 stuff, since I transferred to pc. I completely forgot how much stuff is just gone from the game it’s stupid.
---
That titan looks evil as hell. Good job dose that armour have random rolls or is it like it was before
---
Bro why are you responding to a month old reddit post 🤣. Does this thread pop up when you google “Jötunn OP” or something? Lmao
---
Removed. Pretty sure you'd have a better chance of getting help with this in the bungie forums. 
---
I like OEM where it is now. Other than qwisin, which is fine but spectral itself needs nerfed, hunter exotics in pvp arnt that groundbreaking either. I can never decide which to use and typically just grab stompees for mobility.
---
Was excited for liars handshake but i havnt actually managed to use it. 
---
Yeah I understand they are small but these were non existent with dark shield light coming out of nowhere and nothing in the field reacting to our shots, I guess the invader got me and was sent off the field immediately after, as far as the primeval slayer buffs - don't they come when you kill the envoys or what exactly triggers them? I thought killing envoys triggers them, and why would he say theyre taking a dirt nap when they are so clearly still fighting us? Thanks for you replies, appreciate it
---
I got a zen moment feeding frenzy one the very next time it was the nightfall after that update to it.
---
Leave bread out for a week and it takes the form of a rock. This attack would be very effective.
---
I got it as a random drop from a gambit match after I killed a Vandal.
---
IKR, forgot it was written in Arabic for a sec
---
I’m so tired of the D1 nostalgia carrying over into D2. I wish people would just go back and play D1 if they’re still that into it. Not saying it’s a bad thing, but just enjoy the newer content and move on. 
---
I think it begins with a drop from a Vex
---
Is it just me who absolutely despise most of typical Reddit/sub-reddit culture like these references? 
---
You must be the worlds most humourless and boring person ever
---
Is this the last step for the Thorn quest or am I mistaken?
---
That’s a need to know basis! 
---
Original post? Plz&amp;thx
---
You can sell them to bother Vance on Mercury for a high return on shards, mod components, and enhancement cores. Typically, 1 enhancement core per 10 shards spent, depending on RNG. 
---
You can then also dismantle the shaders for more shards. Can usually get 75-85% of the shards you spent on simulation seeds back, while getting the aforementioned mods and cores. It's the best way to farm for such things.
---
You have all of heroic to go through as well. The minimum glory you need to end at with the weekly bonus is 1980 I believe.
---
How is that? Did someone say something funny?
---
That looks fucking amazing
---
This is a very thought out and valid post. Bungie doesnt check r/destiny2 though. As a recluse owner, everyone should be able to have this gun! Its insane.
---
I wasn't explaining, I was just saying people still shoot it....  More of a mockery to everyone else who still shoots it out of a defensive reflex, but doesn't matter because you chose to be offended by a rando on the net, good luck with that!
---
Yep, tangled shore has a flashpoint 
---
The T is silent in Depot
---
Good old Share Play haha. Sweet video though, nice shooting 🙂
---
That’s weird since she never sells old exotics except for ornaments
---
You have geomag, chill
---
\&gt;  And that weapon is exclusively good in PvP. So where is the problem?  
---
The problem exists for the 99%+ of us who enjoy PvP but don't have the free time to dedicate to unlocking the NF.  There's no point in me continuing this discussion if your ego won't allow you to take an objective look at the problem.
---
Again, I urge you to think about literally any competitive PvP game out there.  If you can provide me an example of another game rewarding the top &lt;1% players with an item in the game that provides more competitive advantage than any other item in the game, I'll eat my shoe.
---
Lol. Not even close to as good, on a subclass thats not great in pvp 
---
It's mainly a confirmation bias people are trying to get. About I'd say about half of the player base hates jötun because it's hard to get so not alot of people have it and it's overpowered as all get out if your on console because warlocks and titans don't have a doge move to get behind cover, including it can one hit supers and over shield which makes it bassically unfair if the person knows what their doing. Including you don't need to have good aim cause of the tracking like wardcliff. But the point is because alot of People hate the gun they will keep coming back to post like this to see if any new developments have happend instead of spamming bingo's twitter with "pls nerf spectral and Jötun it's ruining your player base" tweets.
---
Lol I’m on the other side. I have all Hunter exotics except for Gwinsin Vest. I got back into D2 after the Shards nerf and they pretty much collect dust in my vault. Sucks when you only need one last exotic and pick up your third Gemini Jester doesnt it 
---
This is about how long it took me me. It was a nightmare (strangely fun) but it was the first time I’ve been able to plan my supers/armors/perks on the go. 
---
Hawkmoon was average. Its perk wasn't that great. 
---
LMFAO "refracts off hard surfaces" my clan mate used to do this to himself in leviathan baths on the big guys. used to rage so much.
---
Snitch
---
Name one other game with PvP that rewards the top &lt;1% of the players with the best weapon in the game.  I'll be waiting... 
---
Wrap your brain around that fact that not everyone has 5+ hours a day to play a videogame, that doesn't mean we should have inferior weapons to those who prioritize videogames over real life.  There are plenty of opportunities to show off your lack of employment and real life responsibilities, the trophy doesn't have to be the best weapon in the game.  It can be a shader or an emblem, don't be a bitch.
---
“The trick is living long enough after your super finishes so you can get that stuff refunded.” This quote is you being condescending explaining it, no point in lying on an archived conversation. Try discussing something without feeling the need to act superior by explaining common information and instead bring a valid point.
