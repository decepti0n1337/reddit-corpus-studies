For crucible use something like trust or a shotgun for up close, for pve use whatever guns you like most as pve is generally pretty easy 
---
I ran sweet business and it wrecked! I burned through adds like butter and made that part of the quest super easy. Because of that quest, I switch to my Sweet Business every once in awhile when I run Gambit, it’s too much fun. 
---
I didn't have enough sparkly stuff to buy it with.
---
I didn't complain about being under leveled, the guy said there was 2 people left that aren't max light. I'm clearly one of them I do almost all the weekly milestones I'm just super unlucky all I get is energy weapons and chest pieces. 
---
Yes. All debuffs do not stack, so this includes the hunter tether, the hunter Shattering Strike, the titan Hammer Strike, and tractor cannon. One enemy can only have a single one of those applied at a time. 
---
Well, statistically 4/5 people enjoy it
---
I went old school and used Uriels Gift for the Breakneck grind. Wasn't to bad. Only bad against tanky Cabal. 
---
bro I had the doctrine adept in d1, it was stupidly op before nerf
---
Thought they did thanks 
---
Cloaks and more capes without hoods like the black armoury and Christmas event one would be amazing.
---
Damn, I've been trying to get the Nick Fergussen for ages
---
Needed this right now. Currently I only need to get to fabled. LFG has brought me nothing but toxic players :( and I'm having such a hard time doing it solo.. so yeah needed the boost of confidence! Back to grinding hahaha
---
I got one a few minutes ago on my 10th run.
---
They might actually give it a catalyst with that as the perk
---
But knowing bungie it'll be tied to next seasons pinnacle pvp weapon, whatever that ends up being.
---
Yeah what's going on
---
Big shoutouts to my clan, the ＢＩＧＧＥＳＴ　ＢＬＡＣＫＥＳＴ　ＡＲＭＯＲＹ
---
Roar of the bear?
---
I assumed he'd look like clint eastwood
---
Why does this sound fishy?
---
Yep
---
okay, well you go take a hand cannon and challenge a scout rifle from one end of pantheon to the other (that's an actual long range engagement) and see how that goes for you.
---
A really good game, but not a record.
---
Iron banner Rocket launcher
---
I mean its a rocket launcher, all of them have one rocket (unless you count 2TF)
---
I got a rock...
---
Cayde-6 lives in all of us. 
---
"What? How does it take me out of my thing"? It's a tether buddy that's how it works 
---
Hand it over, that thing...
---
But they gave us what we asked for.   Now you're playing with the same 12 people who are the same rank as you...  For fairness.
---
The destiny app has a fireteam finder that works really well. Every time im looking for a raid group I have to scroll past tons of sweatys lookin for comp buddies.
---
Ture but its a great rocket launcher
---
ewww
---
😋
---
I need this so bad. And Uldren's poncho.
---
The og raid boss
---
I dotn want to get into it that much as i know theres nothing that can be done besides not challenging it or being too far away but to say in simple terms ttk i have no way to counter it until i get my redrix or bother to do the quest hence why im not going to complain about 
---
Doing the chests and oracle will give you some percentage towards the catalyst. It is possible to complete masterwork by doing just chests and oracle, but it will take quite a few weeks to complete as you can only get credit once per weekend. 
---
Pretty dope looking warlock 
---
I see
---
That audio log only applied to if he was killed by a hunter. Since Cayde was not killed by a hunter, that dare was not fulfilled. Since he made a bunch of audio logs, including many for people who could definitely not be hunter vanguard, we can be sure he had a different dare for if he was not killed by a hunter. 
---
Thank you
---
Say hello to my lil friend!
---
Thanks, that looks really clean
---
Thanks I appreciate it!
---
Oh ok I get it. Yeah that's fucked. I'm only like 8 games in for my breakneck. Fuckin hate Gambit. 
---
1k, bow, and ghost shell in one run lol... now that’s a world record right there. Took me 59 clears to my 1k
---
When you spend enough time in Cruci yea
---
If you remember constantly failing Atheon Challenge because your team sucked, i respect you
---
The raid, Scourge of the Past, and the Niobe's Torment puzzle, are the only two things that are impossible to do solo. You get an emblem and ghost shell from Niobe's Torment, but I don't know if there's anything else to it. 
---
To unlock the second and third forge, there are quests that are very difficult, but still possible to solo. 
---
he has 111 days of playtime in the crucible

Fuck those idiots who REFUSED to go through the portal.
---
Good job man! Hey I’m also going for my Not Forgotten and I’m trying to put together a team would you like to be on it? 
---
My psn is pillowman7
---
But the Breakneck’s Rampage is so worth the grind. It’s my primary now for PvE and Gambit
---
Great point, besides I think we all know Ikora would not let that fly. Whether he remembers it or not Ikora Rey holds grudges and she’s a scary woman to be on the bad side of. I feel like Zavala’s sense of duty would allow him to see past Uldren’s dubious past after some time. Although if Uldren is going to be any class he will definitely be a hunter. Do you think he will choose the path of light or go rogue similar to the Drifter?
---
I'm working on mine now, on the invader/invadee kills part!  I had help with the dark motes part.
---
What bow if this?
---
Dude of course! Imma add you.
---
Good job! But how the fuck did you get the full set of dawning gear lol
---
Sorry what am I missing?
---
Great way to capture the moment and get into her pants.
---
this happened to me on wrath of the machine heroic; one of our clan members left when we got to aksis stage 2, and while we were looking for a fourth, we ended up finishing it.
---
That’s wizard came from the moooon!
---
I'm not mad lol. About 40 keys spent on the 1k and over 10 scourge runs 
---
Would you be complaining if you won them?
---
F for dinklebot
---
Lol plays hunter asked how teather knocks him out of his super. He needs to learn the class he plays.
---
using hammers for... good?
---
It's s modifier of another emblem, I think.
---
Celestial on arc. Happy cake day 
---
Lol Orphious rigs on a solar subclass...Good job on the 650 guardian
---
That wizard came from the moon
---
I wish my titan looked as cool as that, he's a right mess right now 
---
Price is worth it
---
Gotcha, good luck with that one!!
---
Yea I hadn't swapped over entirely, too rushed during the walk lol, but thank you
---
Well said i think with activision out of the way bungie can make uldren how he was supposed to be in the first place a rogue guardian/resistance fighter called the crow.
---
That can’t be a Titan. It doesn’t have one eyed mask 😂
---
What’s a normal gun? One with the same perks as your gun so you don’t have to feel bad?
---

I agree but you don't have to be so toxic about it, it just makes you look like the asshole
---
Get my up vote and go back to Ada-1.
---
Dididnt know what LFG meant.
---
You won't.

what settings do you play on lol

Truth is, the game was rigged from the start.

That’s what he does. He drinks and he knows things.

Come on.... Every knows when you fallin, you jump to stay alive
---
Im glad bungie doesnt. Destiny is about cool shit, not about the numbers.
---
 You can easily test it out yourself to find these numbers if you are more interested in that.
---
Did you play with KSI Squids117x?
---

---
One major issue with the base game is that there is very little end game. Forsaken adds *a lot* of things to do, so I think it is worth the price. These are some things you can do with just the base game: 
---
There are strikes and, once you are near or above 270, nightfalls. Nightfalls are more difficult strikes without matchmaking, that each drop a rare unique item. You can turn in tokens to try to get gear with random perks that you like. Each week, do the challenges that appear on the director and say things like "do 3 strikes" or "do 5 crucible matches." These are the only way to raise your power level once you reach power level 260. 
---
You can reach a maximum power level of 300. Once you reach 290, the Leviathan raid unlocks, which you can get loot from once per week per character. All raids were made with six players in mind. Plenty of people still do Leviathan, so you should not have too much trouble finding groups. 
---
Also, be sure to buy anything from Xur that you do not already have. Xur is a hidden NPC who appears on a different planet every Friday, starting at the daily reset time, and disappears on Tuesday at the daily reset time. Right now he is in a cave in the Giant's Scar on Io. You will need a lot of legendary shards to buy from him, so if you need more, turn in the tokens and/or materials you have gathered. 
---
Getting it solo isn’t that hard. The only real issue, if you want to be a solo purist, is the special strike that you have to do that is like 580 power or something. It might be easier now that the power cap has been raised, but I remember it being super difficult, and I ran it in a fireteam of 2. 
---

Datto: *talks about optimizing DPS*                                 Whisper: now this looks like a job for me
---
"Ghost doesn't sound enthusiastic enough" 
---
Well of course he doesn't he's a bloody robot what do you want from the guy 
---
You can only get one key per character per week. Once per *account*, ever,  you can get one key by inputting a wish into the wish wall, but this is not a per week thing, it's a limit of one per person forever. 
---
After that, you just don't open any chests with the keys. Unlike Leviathan keys, they do not disappear at reset. 
---
Congrats!  I'm in the home stretch,  but can't seem to get past 2000.  Gagh!
---
Yes just yes I approve and appreciate 
---
So just keep inputting the wish and beating the raid but not opening the chests for a few weeks? 
---
Nice
---
This is all stuff on Ishtar Collective. 
---
Have you tried factchecking?
---
That wizard came from the moon!
---
I like the macaroni! It takes practice but it’s dece in pvp with oathkeepers
---
r/ghostkeeeping?
---
Yes I will.
---
Where and how much?
---
Same :)
---
Only weapon cores come from the chest. The saboteurs themselves have a chance to drop year 2 versions of certain weapons. 
---
I know, I’ll just miss my double invis dodge lol.  But it is good.
---
Most supers are getting balanced. Tether may be viable again, the TWAB said that it was getting a damage buff.
---
If you run PvE, slap on your Rigs and top tree. As long as you grab 5-6 enemies with your tether, you’ll have your super back immediately. Your fireteam should learn pretty quick that they can go ham on supers and you’ll just keep vomiting orbs at them. 
---
If you don’t want to run support, you can’t beat Stompees. They are the pants for EVERY situation. 
---
All in one day??? Wow.
---
I think the biggest reason why the spam is more noticeable is because maps just feel smaller. You encounter people more often and games move faster. In Destiny 1, I feel like I could play a match and see a certain guy only once or twice because of how big the maps felt. It's either that, or mobility in Destiny 2 is just way higher.
---
meanwhile i got thunderlord from my iron bannner match, keep in mind that it was like my 3rd one of the day after doing everything
---
How are we supposed to remember him then?
---
How are supposed to remember him then?

Just ordered one thanks to your post!

I had the exact same armour setup!!!!11!

Your heart
---
Anytime! Remember Eyes up Guardian.
---
Oh man. I took wavesplitter in to Iron Banner this week until I finished Saladin's bounties. And it was great fun. Helped me finish off those bounties real quick.
---
I notice direct hits not killing most on my spike nade militias birthright, but it is always when the match is a little laggy. 
---
The struggle is real
---
Will do! I’ll warn you though, I haven’t tried any raids yet 
---
I don’t think the damage is really an issue, I’m aware my super won’t get any kills.  I’d just like it to actually tether on impact.  So many times supers kill me after I hit them with the arrow.  
---
UPDATE: I fixed all my issues by using windows 10's own factory reset thingy to wipe my harddrive and reinstall windows, now everything performs like they should :D

Have you played since forsaken came out or no?
---
Well that actually adds up.  Seeing as these maps were designed for 4v4 and are now being filled with 12 people.   I run from one super and return to the fight only to run from another super and so on lol.  I can avoid them it’s just annoying af.  Marathon simulator.
---
Nope last time I actually played was Osiris
---
Trying to understand why the Fallen would hide caches of toast.

Dang that sounds like a tool thats tailored for reddit. How do more people (mainly myself) not know about this??

It’s because of all the titans, lol.

/s
---
*sweet toast
---
Yes I agree
---
"gamer girl" won't increase your chances 
---
Yeah, but I think with a super that is so all or nothing in manner should be a 1 shot if it hits. It's probably the worst subclass tree in the game for PvP.

Ok but seriously I flat-out don't get the joke here. All that's ever in those canisters is Glimmer

---
I miss dinklebot
---
I'm obviously missing something. How do you get enough special ammo in PvP? I have the perks on my armor and have no problems in PvE but in PvP I run out quick. That's why I was thinking of using weapons that use primary only.
---
Just spent some time on in the EDZ with a Zen Moment/High-Impact reserves Ether Doctor and the Ikelos Hand Cannon and I rather like the combo. The ED is 544, and the Ikelos\_HC is still 340. Are they worth infusing to use?

Found out when mine arrived and coworker was like :O ‘it must be mine’ and set out on a quest to get his that day. He came back from lunch with a sandwich to eat at his desk after a 7mile trip to the mall out of town on his lunch hour, with the book. 
---
Gwisin vest is stupid good, I just got it yesterday and the first time I used it in iron banner I got a team wipe.
---
OG's unite. Guardians through and through.
---
Me too! Every bloody time. If I have to grind that, my friends always question why this part of the game scares me. I normally blow up or get stuck in the roof of the tunnel
---
And on the subject of bows: just don't. Just don't use bows.
---
Still working on those, I have a masterworked ace defiant chest piece at 650 but I wanted to wear a full set of matching gear. My masterworked weapons still need to be infused.
---
Can't you put a spoiler please? I'd likke to discover the art on the book myself, so thanks for ruining one of the illustration.
---
you can only put one tag and i chose art, if ou dont want destiny spoilers don’t come to a destiny reddit where people post shit all the time. And what was spoiled you were gonna see the art eventually right, here it is. Spoilers only work if you find out about an event or something that happened. If it’s just viewing a piece of art it can’t be a spoiler. Here you see it congrats you looked at it. Your welcome. Go complain somewhere else.
---
Wish I could get nice teammates like you. Mine all use me as a meat shield while they run away.
---
Pvp can be fun if you don’t take it too seriously, hence why I only do IB and quick play.
---
No? Who's that?
---
I absolutely love the style and interpretation of the titan on this piece your brother has a serious talent. 
---
The last dreg coming to beat the (not so) living shit out of you.
---
Still need to grind breakneck. Well worth
---
Supers and one hit weapons allow people who have them to one hit others.
---
If you do not run one shot weapons, you are at a disadvantage. If you do not run meta weapons, you are at a disadvantage.
---
You must run a HC/Shotgun or Pulse Rifle/Shotgun build otherwise you will die in engagements where the enemy has better gear.
---
And strategy matters little if your gear simply doesn't match up. Last time I used an SMG, no matter how hard I outplayed my opponent, I couldn't kill him, because my weapons simply did so little dmg that it didn't matter.
---
There are weapon classes that are completely useless in PvP. That's a huge problem.
---
I'm always among the top players when I play PvP, but it takes considerably less effort to do so than in any other game.
---
"Will a shotgun help you get an easy kill close up? Yeah. Will using it make you win your game? Definitely not."
---
It will make winning considerably easier than say, a sidearm pistol.
---
It’s in there,  but you have to delete the character. 
---
calus’ selected looks great on bygones with no ornament
---
But he also didn’t kill him even though he was running with the follows of yor. That said he did give intel on the followers. I think he walks a fine line. 
---
Cayde seemed to be okay with him enough 
---
There's a bug in his spawn placement. Sometimes he either spawns outside of the map or under it, and falls into a deathwall. Have to keep waiting for another one
---
Yeah wtf ntk.  First I have no prob with an invader portal camping if he get the kills. Second op has a decent number of enemy kill for someone who would have been over the other side for half the game. Nice one op! 
---
guess ill save my shards ...  i have  everything here 
---
Joke's on you, our eyes can't even perceive more than 1k.
---
Congrats.   I was running the daily strike, one I hadnt done in the dreaming city, was constantly dying from falling off edges or just having no idea what to do in the jumping puzzle, last crate spits out this.   I could not stop laughing.
---
This. so much this.
---
They're great in pvp,1 kill will give you about a third of your super back, but if you can get a double or triple with it you get your super back straight away
---

When you have 4/9/14 motes but your teammates picks that one mote while having 0.

"your motes"
---
Don't worry, you too have problems. 
---
You should put this in with the Forge Cloak on. Not the Raid one, but the one from the Forge. 
---
Got this for Christmas, great emblem too!
---
My bad, I just thought your post came across as salty, and I'm used to seeing salty comments on every post.
---
Also I would disagree that the mission is a cakewalk. Sure, you can get carried through, but many players wouldn't otherwise be able to complete it easily as the parkour is very difficult and the enemies are very powerful and tanky.
---
User flair is hunter... BOYS WE HAVE A TRAITOR!
---
Got Malfeasance and Breakneck on the same match coincidentally after grinding for ages. Safe to say, I won’t touch gambit for a while 😂
---
Well I suppose your right i can at least let OP know i did so 
---
What's the inspiration for this one? It feels so familiar but I can't put the finger on it.

Can confirm.

Not real OG,

this post broke the beckenstein limit. 
---
Are you kidding me? I did so much farming there. All the kills needed for all three swords. God damn those sword quests were the worst. 
---
Never played in year one, but I still get this.
---
I only bring out telesto when ive been killed by it just to show the person using it its not fun nor skillful 
---
So many people didnt. I remember people complained so much. 
---
I think riskrunner is a fun weapon. I just used tigerspite for the auto kills then used go figure which is one of my favourite weapons to complete the matches. I found I had the kills before I was even 15/40 matches complete 😂
---
I used the original red dead cover art as inspiration
---
Maybe in the next game, but surely not in D2.
---
Bungie is slowly (i mean really slowly) approaching the RPG elements from other games. Collections was a really good addition and needs some updates. Armor ornaments were a great idea aswell. Now they should really focus on giving the player a reasonable grind and not just dramatic increases of material cost. It forces the player to play with things they don't want to.
---
However the exotics should not be changed, only legendary armor should have that trait.
---
Tyrion Cannister
---
No
---
I did it with random people and luckily on my 40th Gambit match, someone on my team got 4 invader kills and I completed the objective 😀I was around 625 when I did the quest. 
---
Exotics should be excluded from transmog. Just so people know what you are using.
---
I am aware that raid pieces have lore. They could remove the transmog effect if they are special armor, or they could remove the lore text if it has one attached.
---
That quest man it's a killer the reco power should be higher or everything should be easier 
---
Aping in quick play, you get my downvote :)
---
Wow you are worked up over this. I'm not attacking you just giving a different viewpoint. Have you ever used suppressors? Just chuck it doesn't work seeing as they have a timer before they go off. If you trade every time you can't call it a counter it's a check at best. 
---
If your measure for good neutral game is a one shot melee then yes titan is the best. Other than that you're way off, titans have almost zero air game and some of the worst PvP grenades. Shoulder charge in a world of shotguns is not as good as you seem to think. You can see them coming a mile away and if you get hit by it once you know to look for it. You say various ways to get overshield and damage buffs but the only overshields are on inferior subclasses like top tree sentinel and bottom tree hammers. As for damage buffs the only one I can think of is middle arc which requires an ammo pack. 
---
Hunters have great neutral game and I don't think I should have to explain why. It sounds like you have only ever played hunter from this post. 
---
Yep. The Corrupted, I sadly had to resort to the fireteam app. Wasn't too bad though
---
How long have you been away from the game? It sounds like you're getting Prime engrams without realizing what they are, but I could be wrong 
---
Well if I get a hankering to undertake the quest again I might force myself into the switch. I’ve been using the tigerspite as well as sort of a “modern” replacement for the origin story. I’m liking the forge auto rifle too the ringing nail but I really haven’t found a forge gun that I didn’t like using yet. 
---
He's queued with 4 or 5 other people too
---
So are you a blade barrage hunter or nova warp lock? Because we know exactly how much skill that takes.
---
Using your logic playstation has almost no exclusives too, since they can be streamed on PS, and you don’t need to own a ps4 to make a psn account, so playstation has NO exclusives because you can play them on pc
---
If you don't just run out, you can react and also hear the charging sound, just sayin...
---
They come out when a public event is about to happen or the public event is going on
---
so awesome 
---
That would be awesome, but I feel that Bungie of old departed many years ago. 
---
You wouldn't have to play the mode...
---
More like Sleeper Simulant
---
It is very good, but fuck level 3 armor!
---
I always felt like Ghost is at the point where he has trust that his guardian will fix whatever problem they come against. I mean, we literally killed gods. The rest of this is taking out the trash.
---
Feast upon this yeast
---
Kind of sucks how these cool dreaming city things never get done because the rewards have always been hot garbage
---
Nolanbot is better
---
don’t @ me
---
I value your opinion more that a streamer’s.
---
Thanks! 
---
Agreed
---
This helmet is what sucked me into the first expansion. I wasn’t going to get it but got this thing and couldn’t equip it without it. I’ve been hooked since.  
---
I didn't play when Dinklebot was around, but the lines I've heard sounded like they should have had more takes. He's an excellent actor, so maybe it was Bungie's fault that he didn't work out for voice overs. Just sounded way too much like he was reading from the script, rather than feeling comfortable with his character.
---
My groups been wanting to do it. But guitar error has been the main wall block in our way. 
---
I havnt been guitarred in weeks and the second we mention it last night. 
---
15 seconds into the mouth.  
---
Punted.  :/
---
If there was a guitar error that was anywhere but the last freaking encounter.. I prolly wouldn’t mind so much. lol 
---
That's kind of not any kind of solution at all. "We made the one competitive mode alienate you and you can just not play it if you like" is not a constructive take at all
---
OP AF in Halo 3 
---
This just happened to me during the gravetide summoner bounty. Needless to say it was a pretty easy fight.
---
The one that Saladin is selling is very nice. Snapshot, opening shot. 
---
Event should have dropped Enhancement Cores and legendary shards... you know, something people actually need instead of the same mundane loot that only gets deconstructed anyways.
---
Hey what platform are you on? I dont have an active clan but I'm in the same boat you are, 555 hunter looking to do raids and end game stuff 
---
yes, and their reasoning was auto rifles have to be used up close in the same world as shotguns.....
---
Oh yes. Very much. 
---
Hunter jump is sooo much nicer...

Good luck fellow guardian

Snapshot is good but explosive payload is kind of a neutral perk. I don't really like it. It's kinda up to you on that one. 
---
I did see someone who had the same character as me yesterday. Are you EU?
---
Lol. I just saw you included system in your comment. Psn name is chubbyunicorn35 if you want to add
---
Destiny: The Golden Age 
---
Yes there’s a bundle called Legendary collection including forsaken (warmind and orisis dlc too) and then we have complete edition which gives you annual pass (3 upcoming dlcs, one is already out. The other 2 are coming out in spring and summer) and some cosmetics.
---
Now, you get a level 30 character boost, but I highly recommend using it for your secondarh character, since those helps with grinding Power Level.
---
It along with the Massive fat worm spotted in the archeology mission are teasers for future content which Titan would be perfect for.
---
r/mildlyinfuriating
---
I wish Bungie really made good context
---
Do you really think someone from activision gave someone at bungie a call "Hey, how about you put some duplicate cosmetics into your lootbox thingies whatever. K THX BYE!"
---
That's simply a fuckup, and it's making them look really bad.
---
Not that I'm happy with all the reskins either, but at the end of the day, I just don't care about eververse.
---
Transmog FTW
---
Listen here you little shit
---
It isn't a worm god. It's a leviathan. There are some theories as well that it could be ahamkara if you watch the lore video linked in this post. 
---
You have to buy the base game, yes. And there are bundles that include most of the dlc. But the most recent expansion (annual pass) is seperate from all previous dlc. Should be able to get everything just about $100. But you dont need all at once. If you get everything except annual pass you can play for a good 6 months before running out of content then purchase annual pass for 35. What system you on.

Destiny 2: Electric Boogaloo
---
Welp, and here I thought I didn't want any of the Iron Banner gear and ignored it all season. Time too grind
---
I once got two exotics in row after consecutive crucible matches 
---
[removed]
---
Oh ok that sounds pretty good. I'll be playing on xbox
---
I can ask my clan leader if you can join, are you NA or EU? We’re also around 6-7 members, where as 4 of us are only online. But we’re still very active.
---
DAMNNNNN
---
Lol hey thanks 
---
I have it, can confirm, orgasm by every shot too.
---
I'm in NA!
---
Damn i was hoping for a ps4 player lol. Then id be able to help you
---
Oh it will be. EA is a sign of bad news.
---
F2P Destiny with Path of Exile style cosmetics when
---
I mean, the 50 precise kills bounty is not hard to do. I managed to do it in ~2 days (and trust me, my aim isn’t good). That one gives you powerful gear + 25 ib tokens + the possibility to unlock a really good roll for it.
---
Devour the flour 
---
it's just a pain with the cryogenic pods and shitheads burning the boss before you can get the orbs
---
I wouldn't know what it's like
---
Do you have trinity ghoul tho? 
---
(I'm not even a warlock anymore I started maining hunter after forsaken because thousand cutty bois of course)
---
Indeed I do. 
---
Malfeasance?
---
I don't think it's so much about having to complete content on time as it is being forced to stick to an unrealistic schedule. Releasing content every 4 months made it so that they struggled to make the content drops feel big enough, and people would frequently complain "that's it?" We're seeing improvements with the season pass, where all assets are going to end game content, but you can tell that the release schedule really took away from the quality of what was released. 
---
You can see how much love and passion goes into the September releases of Destiny (Taken King, Rise of Iron, D2, Forsaken). I personally would rather see one huge release every year with small bits of content in between, like the seasons pass, instead of those ridiculous, unrealistic release schedules they were doing before.
---
Rebooting development midway through a project sounds like a much greater contribution in creating a rushed game.  Maybe Activision wouldn't give them the extra 1.5 years they needed in dealing with the extra work rebooting the project required, but do you really think Bungie actually went to Activision to detail how they fucked up and ask for extra time?  No because they'd already been given a lot of money and didn't want to look like fools.
---
Oh yeah and don't forget the EXACT same thing happening to D2
---
They had a 10 year contract, it ended. Story done.
---
You twats and your conspiracies aren’t doing the business any good with your bullshit stories. 
---
Should'bt it be hogmoon?
---
No. I don’t have friends to do darkness in the light with ;-;
---
Wich platform?
---
PC
---
.... damn.
---
Companion app can help.
---
Did. My LFG message got lost in the sea of SoTP and LW raids.
---
I don't think anyone wants to run with a player who never did the raid either.
---
Your KD must be awful. No offense. You have zero medium range and obviously no long range. What do you do? Camp corners and crouch? 
---
Yeah I’m in an LFG discord, so I’ll find someone eventually. On the topic of mains, I main hunter in PvE and warlock in PvP for Nova Warp *menacing laugh*
---
Probably cabal, when they put the shield down it sends you flying and you usually die. It's a common bug. Just keep that in mind in the future so you can run away as soon as the bank drops and they start to spawn in.
---
Been there since September 
---
it would take me a month just to find 1 match,  matchmaking is dookie give us dedicated servers.
---
I can't cooperate with you anymore sorry. 
---
^^^^^^^/s
---
HAVE SOME GOD DAMN FAITH, ARTHUR!
---
You are everything I hate
---
And one more thing... if you don’t already know, there’s a gun called the Queenbreaker. You. Will. **HATE.** It.
---
LMGs are not intended to be precision weapons. they're "suppressive fire" and bullet hoses. if anything, they might make them less accurate instead of less ammo.
---
Not really an unrealistic schedule for a team of like 750 people plus help from other studios like travellers tales honestly,   
---
Thing is Activision only expected one major release a year with smaller dlcs which is exactly what we got. 
---
you dont need to be planted to get the kill.... literally just crouch and flick shot. its not that hard, which is why its not skill based at all.
---
I was floating to it when it went down and them spawning in launched me, so it wasn't the taken cabal shield, I guess it's just a bug but it almost made me break my monitor :/
---
Thanks!
---
Op, do it
---
I was stoked! Now, let me dual wield! Haha
---
Thanks man much appreciated, 90% of the time I'm just guessing what to do 😂
---
I got a lights out with 2 nova warp charges. This shit needs to be toned down a lil. One eyed mask on the other hand... nerf it into the ground. Yes I’m salty. 
---
From everything I’d heard, yes: yes it is. I’m probably in RNG jail now for weeks on end. 
---
Just keep trying. Explain your situation in 10 words or less on lfg, plenty of people help. Be patient and diligent, you'll get it done
---
Hahaha it just takes practice. I haven’t played for months before I started the grind, so it was a rough start.
---
Lol I called out the first one on chat. The second, I just stfu. I don’t know if anyone else got it to drop. I felt so guilty. 
---
Thanks man!
---
Working as intended
---
&gt; OEM isn't that great.
---
It is the best exotic in the game by far, especially for PVP. 
---
Not worth the hassle then
---
Ah gotcha
---
Problem still not fixed\~
---
Make Destiny great again 
---
Thunderlord is now a random drop. Only the quest for it went away, because the quest was part of a holiday event. 
---
If things keep going as they are, there's a chance Crimson Days or Solstice of Heroes (upcoming holiday events) will add machine guns that any player can get. 
---
I think you may have messed up then because warframe has a great story. 
---
Or just unfuck it enough to be playable
---
The issue is I'm still working through till 610 on all my dudes before I buy armory 
---
Despite the blueberry destroying the blights
---
Yes. Go Figure is amazing, and I love using it. 
---
Waiting for the Auto Rifle buff though. Excited to see what it does to Suros Regime and Uriels Gift. Plus it will help with the breakneck quest
---
I don't play Crucible. I was referring to Gambit, as you can see in my original post. 
---
I assume it’s going to be mida tools and regimes 
---
I remember using Go Figure for the first time in crucible. When I two bursted I guy I knew I found my favorite weapon 
---
If you’re not good at a whole game, you’re not good at the game, you’re good at PvE.
---
3 stacks
---
Gonna turn into the full dan and 3 tap people with kill clip lol
---
I think his gamer tag implies RNGesus is probably his son. 
---
Works fine for 99% of other players maybe your internet is the issue
---
Niobe is even better...because fuck tracer shanks
---
Did you have a point to make? Or is this a failed attempt at a troll post? 
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 13.
---
/r/Fireteams 
---
Scout rifle lmao
---
I was testing what solar gun to use and tried the polaris. Bad decision (although its a good gun)
---
It’s a terrible gun don’t worry, use mindbenders for solar kills 
---
I'm only laughing because I don't want to get marked. 
---
Its called a Plaque, not a gravestone.
---
Thanks dude/ette. 
---
It reminded me of Monkey from my childhood!
---
Really good roll compared to the curated roll!
---
Anyone has any idea what the name of the movie/series is?
---
If I had to guess there are mental issues involved. 
---
Personally I just went slow my first few matches to get a feel for headshots, try not to be too rigid and aim for just their head, go for shots around their upper torso and shoulders, you'll have a good chance to hit them. Honestly after a few matches you get much better at hitting headshots.
---
Wouldn't know.
---
Terrible handling ads time reload speed zoom and low body shot damage sitting in the back of the map while the other team gets heavy would like a word
---
Nvm. I thought you were OP. i just did a letras like an hour before this post came out, and you talking about the guitar bug is exactly what i was explaining to my group.figured you one of theguys i just played with
---
.... I’m gunna flex here. I’m only missing, thousand voices, anarchy, Oathkeepers, and Jötun
---
That's exactly the problem.  There shouldn't be a "most effective" loadout. Everything should have enough viability to warrant some usage in the crucible.  Bungie can't get it through their heads that we have hundreds of weapons in the game, but only a handful of them ever see the light of day in the Crucible.  I have Luna's Howl and a few amazingly rolled Dust Rock Blues and Wardcliff (masterworked) and I don't use them because I prefer to use weapons I enjoy, not what everyone else is using.  This is the best example Monkey-See, Monkey-Do game I've ever witnessed in my life.
---
Yes
---
It should be noted you can currently try blackout free through battle.net or console stores until the 24th. its like 80 gigs of space tho.
---
it didn’t really grab me but no BR really has, it seemed interesting at least. 
---
Oh , super cool ! 
---
Mine was the laser pointer, Vigilance was my second
---
I hate some people who use wooosh but yes
---
das racist 
---
Nice, it's a pretty long grind
---
I have yet to find a fireteam for that mission cant seem solo it );
---
Were you playing iron banner last night?
---
Warlock jumps pretty flimsy tbf
---
&gt;I understand that the majority of the issues stem from Activision
---
How exactly do you understand that? I think you're confusing understanding with assumption. 
---
(For those who wanted it...)[https://www.reddit.com/user/ZePanzerFaust/comments/ai1dt7/for_those_who_wanted_to_hear_my_laugh/]
---
But there is a decent pool of moderately effective weapons that can be used as well, which i personally see get some use. I can't speak for your experience though.
---
I use (and occasionally see) bygones, trust, la monarque, parcel of stardust, pillager, Atalanta-D, distant relation, kindled Orchid, blast furnace, chattering bone, horror story, and many others.
---
I guess what I'm trying to say can be summarized into two points. 1) There is a good amount of weapons that are super effective in the crucible outside of the main handful used and 2) I'm just trying to say a person isn't inherently a tryhard player just because they are using one of the meta tools or being generally good at the game. Yeah try hards exist and they can damper the experience, but there's decent casual players like myself.
---
[ok](https://www.reddit.com/user/ZePanzerFaust/comments/ai1dt7/for_those_who_wanted_to_hear_my_laugh/]
---
Its a KRS-One song
---
Those are Latent Memories or also know and Lost Memory Fragments. You collect them by shooting them with specific weapon energy types and the Javelin to advance the World Line Zero sword quest. 
---
Have to leave 1st
---
Boi
---
It's just a visual glitch from what I heard. I saw a guy drop like 5 before
---
don't use drop mag with outlaw
---
Combine all the best looking exotics for each class on one character
---
Drop Mag and Outlaw don't stack - don't use Drop Mag
---
Scorn cheat
---
Crimson^ 
---
(But on the other side scorn are the only ones that can teleport sorta like taken but taken are only at the end so)
---
Also they have screeb, enough said we all hate them 
---
Chieftain tethers and all their abilities are BS 
---
Other then that all good 
---
Nice, I'm on that grind for that gun, I'm currently on the get 25 quickplay/rumble/comp matches, and I just need 23 more comp matches and I'll be done with that. Working on getting 5 resets in this current season too, 3/5 with my 4th reset coming up.
---
Only need 35 out of the 40 which if you Google where they are it shouldn't take any longer then maybe an hour 
---
It's literally the exotic with the most perks ever and its honestly probably the most fun in the game 
---
For PVE I'd rather not 
---
I wish it would happen to me on the Insight Terminus mission for the Izanami Igniter. That thing has been eating my lunch.
---
Anytime those Scorn Heavy Bois show up, I might as well kiss my motes goodbye. 
---
Same with the damn Shriekers and Cabal turrets. 
---
Even when I’m sniping them from afar or just trying to bank from the previous zone, they still hone in on me if I have more than five motes. 
---
If you were XBL I'd say let's go get it. 
---
Run that one solo a few times now. And carried a couple through. Always willing to lend a helping hand where I can  
---
Another scout buff? What's this one since the last one was 150 damage increase
---
My tip is bank around 6-10 each time and keep an eye on your opponents score as well. Once someone starts invading, hide or bank as fast as you can
---
Oh, great choice of music to go with it.
---
Yeah, I know... but there’s like a half a second in between 10 bullets firing at you. If you hit headshots with it, it has one of, if not the fastest time to kill in the game. 
---
Except for when everyone’s melts the boss on the cryo pods before you can get him frozen 
---
Pretty much only exotic sparrows and ships (and even then, only the ones after Warmind) start to look unique with some personality in them. I think Bungie has been doing a good job recently what with some crazy designs like the Whisper ship and the chopper-esque Sparrows, but they're all basically exotics.
---
That drawing is fucking great OMG.
---
This is zero effort, where is the funny part.
---
I've taken to using the tethers just so that when they do this, at least they clear the adds.
---
Stop wasting my time and being the enemy of the people with shit to do on tangled shore and other places 
---
Thats actually really smart im going to start doing that when i play hunter
---
It's not the best for PvE, but it's probably the most broken PvP exotic armour we've had, save for maybe Y1 Ram and Twilight Garrison
---
And you’re in IB, where, like I said, anything goes. I don’t disagree with what you’re doing I was just trying to explain to the other dude why some people were saying it appeared like you guys checked all the boxes being for the worst people to play against. 
---
Please..... I'm scarier with a QueenBreaker
---
Having played it, the lack of faith is justified.  But if you like Warframe and felt it needed a lot more grind, you will have blast.
---
That's right. Get in close for the nova bomb.
---
If the enemy has level 20s hunt them and only them but if not just sneak around to capture the points
---
And I guess that's the...*hard truth*
---
Yeah I really don’t understand why they do that with the banner. Literally makes zero sense to me other than to let bad players with high light feel like gods for a while.  The whole game is set up to make bad players feel good.  
---
honestly that’s kind of surprising, i thought they’d put you in with other low light people. are you playing by yourself or are you with a fire team of higher light people?
---
I like the pun you made (perhaps inadvertently?) in your title. 
---
myself, level 20 vanilla D2
---
Aint got nothing on my god roll blat furnace
---
Pretty sure activision being investigated for fraud played a small part in that. Because with how financial investigations usually work this current investigation was probably already being started, or at least made known to activision prior to the split. 
---
If your not max light or near max light you're just not meant to play Iron Banner.
---
There's no secret to it, it's just an end game pvp mode. You will get to 640-650 in time. Iron Banner comes up a whole bunch. 
---
You got the ultra rare 2k voices, a triumph so secret, Bungie doesn't even know about it
---
That event doesn't need to be heroic for the quest, so if you are not with other players who know how to make it heroic, only worry about completing the event. You'll want a crowd clearing super and a boss killing heavy weapon. Prioritize killing the scorn chieftains over all the little scorn, as long as they don't overwhelm you. 
---
Vendar, Flight of Oryx
---
I had to read it again before I understood. Yeah that was completely coincidental haha
---
Iron Banner is a temporary event and its heavily focused on light level. I think it’ll be over at Tuesday weekly reset. Sorry bud. 
---
Are you missing dlc?
---
Forsaken dlc
---
I know it doesn't have to be heroic, I've read that it's easier normally. But literally every time I get on there are 3 others that appear out of nowhere right before the event starts and make it heroic.
---
Do you only have the base game? 
---
Don’t haven any DLC. Do I seriously have to spend 40 damn dollars?
---
dont forget izanagi isnt a heavy weapon so you can run that and a machine gun at the same time.
---
You need the DLC’s in order to level up beyond lvl 20
---
That’s annoying
---
Yeah
---
That’s usually what I focus on when I see level 20 and lower in public events. 
---
Nothing in life is truly free. $40 is cheap. Support bungie, you obviously appreciate all their hard work and effort
---
That's how rng works
---
Don't get me wrong I love it, I'm the guy who will run Jade, Polaris, niflheim and more just cause especially in crucible 😂
---
That’s my permanent loadout now. It’s almost feels perfect 
---
Everything that changes how the game plays can be picked up by anyone within the game, nobody spawns in with an advantage
---
Too broke. Bungee will have to wait I guess
---
That's why. The expansions raised the lvl cap multiple times since original launch. Consider getting the Forsaken dlc. It includes a lot (not all) of the content and you should be able to find it cheap. It's worth $30 bucks if you're enjoying the game so far
---
Credit to u/deadly_nightshaade
---
Yes they're still independent of each other and have been since before the Vivendi split 6 years ago. The CEOs meet at the end of each quarter with the heads of Activision Blizzard Inc to go over financial reports before they present it to investors. That's it. With the exception of Battle.net, Activision Publishing Inc's operations are completely separate from Blizzard Entertainment's. Diablo Immortal was 100% Blizzard.
---
Saying Activision had a say in Diablo Immortal is like like saying 2k had a say in RDR2. Same parent company with completely separate operations.
---
Alrighty, thanks man.
---
Lol I dont think that its Bungie that will have to do any waiting
---
Cheers. Have fun
