/r/blursedimages was what I was referring to lol.
---
You got it!
---
Omg it's in my pursuits, the arms dealer strike. Thanks
---
I'm going to guess your on console so, is erentil super popular too on console?
---
Umm ok
---
^^^ you deserve a high five breh üñêÔ∏è
---
Unpopular opinion: The javelin from DS2 was the most satisfying weapon to use in Dead Space. I swear, this f#cking gun could be in any game, I'd use it.
---
Ahh ok, never new this existed in here!
---
You‚Äôre def right but he‚Äôs just pointing out how much of a little bitch that destiny can be sometimes. Don‚Äôt deny it, you know it to be true.
---
Nice flag, where‚Äôs it from?
---
Could it be... Tex Markerna?
---
Definitely keep us updated because I'm always fascinated on how these printers work
---
Thanks üòÇ

Confirmed: Crushinator is a vex

I‚Äôve hit a tensies (10x kill streak) before on my Titan and got the quote from Shaxx saying ‚ÄúWith ten hunters like you!!!!....‚Äù
---
I love using The Last Word, Blast Furnace and Mindbender's Ambition... But that's just me...
---
Yeah true. On my PlayStation account it happens every time I go into the tower
---
I posted it there too, it's stilling at 0 upvotes.  I think unfortunately this affects PvP players more than PvE players who can do just fine with the main 2 perks and don't need the right barrel/scope along with ricochet rounds to even be relevant.  Their 1/20 odds to get what they need make this a non-issue... we have 1/1,200 odds but we play PvP instead of PvE so nobody cares...
---
You sir need a fresh towel !
---
Oh thank god thank you so much
---
Everyone deserves mountain top. Just ignore his ignorance. He obviously doesnt want it and is jealous you are bustung your ass for it.
---
I‚Äôm a completionist, albeit a busy one, and that‚Äôs why I liked Y1. It had enough that getting everything was a challenge, but there wasn‚Äôt so much it was impossible.
---

---
Now I can‚Äôt do the whole ‚Äú10-hour pinnacle quest for every faction‚Äù thing. I mean, I like it and I like the weapons, but getting all of them isn‚Äôt plausible for me
---
Load out was Rose, Beloved, and whisper
---
Super Soaker 20XX
---
Bro that wall stays talking shit though
---
I swear it only procs like 10% of the time which is pretty low since I‚Äôm sacrificing using trust, jotunn, last word... for these noble rounds
---
That's what it is, and it's an **AWESOME** sidearm. Nice to see someone else appreciate it.
---
If you have 2 friends who dont mind carrying you through the mission i auggest doing so. Otherwise you wont be able to do much damage if any at all. But if you do grab the annual pass its super easy to get 690+ ina matter of an hour or so. Just do the invitation quest chain for the menagerie. You will get it once you complete the main story to forsaken and achieve level 50.
---
Yea I feel that. To this day I can't even get an erentil with TTT + Firmly planted. Not to mention the other perks. It's one of the reasons I was very happy about the Menagerie bug. I got myself a nice Austringer &amp; Beloved, and then didn't have to touch PvE outside of occasional stuff with friends.
---
I really, *really* enjoy Destiny PvP, it's a shame it's so difficult to stay relevant in it with it getting left behind all the time
---
Bans are extremely rarely given out for things that can't/couldn't be proven by Bungie.
---
You either DDOSed, hacked, or was incredibly rude to another player. Cannot imagine the finale resulting in a ban though.
---
I'm still amazed I finished exotic quests that require PvP play considering I'm horrible at it.
---
Greetings, guardian! If you prefer PVP, you get a powerful drop after each title rank up ( not for sub ranks) if you enjoy PVE, Forges and the nightfall bonus might be a good idea. What console do you play on?
---
From a military standpoint, you generally wouldn't expend your entire fighting force in one area unless you already had encountered and faced a loss with a smaller expeditionary force. Which is pretty much what happened. Also space magic from the giant disco ball.
---

---
Something you did or had running will have triggered the auto detect, and on review it was confirmed to be in violation of t and c. Sorry but yes your out $80. On a rare occasion groups have been unbanned when a class of ban was reversed, but its extremely rare.
---
So, since you are never going to get the ban reversed...what did you do?
---
Why whisper lol?
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat as you but I actually still love to play. I currently log on everyday to stockpile MW cores. Also try soloing 100k nightfalls. It‚Äôs actually a lot of fun when you try to figure out the best weapons to use for the burns and what ad you have to kill to progress and just figure out a strategy.
---
I have that exact image from like 2 months ago
---
Warlocks used to look so good :(
---
Thanks for the information.
---
That is a fantastic idea!
---
Was not even aware of the Blink movement mode - thx guys!
---
I don't think so. I clearly remember going in and killing someone that had popped their super to kill me and it counted. I may be wrong, but I'm pretty sure it's either way.
---
Yes
---
I can't stand being on io for some reason. I just despise everything about it
---
Here‚Äôs one of mine from the dawning event  [Dawning event](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/c5q8ns/an_old_vid_of_me_playing_frisbee_with_the_other/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
Thanks for feedback because I‚Äôm actually planning on making a comic! So that is very helpful
---
Thank you
---
Nice lol
---
I did, I did. Now Bungie just has to do the thing.
---
I played against Datto and a couple of his buddies in a Gambit Prime match, as soon as I sniped him during one of his invades I read his name on the kill feed and freaked out.
---
Realized he also streamed that match as well and got to watch it afterwardsüòÇ
---
im the same wirh mercury... to the point where i actually feel sickly when im on it
---
I feel like bungie gave up on making enjoyable play spaces
---
Why do I have a hard time believing this?....
---
There's always that one guy who ruins the party.
---
Gotta get you an ultrawide Destiny wallpaper. Unless you like it like that.
---
That's a shader I'd spend cash on silver for. The only one.
---
Fuckkkk
---
So, if I buy what is currently being offered on Battle.net, I get every DLC that goes up to Forsaken, the current annual pass, and a character boost for the price of the Forsaken expansion when it launched? And it will all transfer to Steam (hopefully) without any problems in the Fall? 
---
Sounds pretty worth it to me, but I‚Äôm just repeating the FAQ into one big ball in-case I missed something important.
---
I never said I backed either side, contrary to your claim.  I was identifying that the other person may indeed have empathy, in that they know of and understand your situation as a PvPer.  They do not have to take any action to have empathy.  They simply do not Sympathize with your stance, clearly by thire response.  But there is no indication that they have no empathy.  They just are not responding with empathy.
---
TOOOOOOTALLY agree with ya on that sentiment!!^^
---
Just focus on the main story for now. There's a lot of stuff you'll figure out as you go along. The glowing wall is because you don't have the annual pass to get to ada-1
---
Speaking of PvP, I have a 3 round burst pulse rifle that I need to lay like 6 clicks in just to kill a guy meanwhile I get one shotted half the time.... 
---
Even though PvP advantages are ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù
---
I mean bounties do tell you where you need to go, imperials pop with trophies and the chests on the barge. Buy guns from the vendors if your struggling, theyll never be top tier but will be strong enough to help you get going or work on pinnacles, loaded question for example is actually a great pve gun. But most importantly, read the information the game gives you, you might have an easier time.
---
Oh God... He does doesn't he...
---
That's a new horrible way to think about him. Thanks...
---
Invite em back! Be the change you want you see in the world, guardian.
---
You spelled super wrong lol.
---
They should do a joke title like "YouTube Lore Guy"
---
[Do you know about Xur?](https://wherethefuckisxur.com/) He is a hidden NPC who sells exotics and an item called Five of Swords. You use this item to increase or decrease nightfall difficulty and score multipliers. I think around 1.5 should be enough for a 50k.
---
Happy cake day dude
---
Apply more modifiers from your 5 of swords card or decrease your light level by 100 from the card
---
Then nothing will change for ya!
---
I kinda fell in love with it too after the wendigo quest. But I‚Äôm a pve player
---
Yes, it will cost. Bungie is switching PC platform so we all have to pay for it to continue playing for a game we bought.
---

Please don't spread misinformation.

Link to official bungee post where I grabbed the screenshot https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47952

Same here brother, same here üò≠
---
Also won‚Äôt work against Hunters for this reason
---
If you need to go to YouTube for every bounty you get something like fortnight might be more suited for you.
---
Man... how do you even get to think such a thing...

Is that VaatiVidya? /s

Life is meaningless and these accolades will not fill the void of existential dread as your corporeal form withers and the light of your consciousness dims in the face of the ever consuming universe as it continuously pulls the thread of time to unravel any sense of accomplishment and purpose that you‚Äôve concocted in the hours upon hours upon hours of blue light toxins rendered from a device that has more purpose than you will ever know as it fulfills it‚Äôs designed purpose and you sit, withering, fading, becoming nothing and progressing nowhere
---
Might be a 100 Thieves thing?
---
The reason I think so highly of FL is because that's one of the few weapon/weapon types i will never master, along with sniper, handcannon, and bows. The fact that it really takes a while for the feeling to sink in everytime I use fighting lion, is more than enough to make me respect whoever runs it regularly in PVP. 
---
That, or I just played too much light machine guns in every major FPS games for me to really have any skills.
---
You okay mate? It seems as though you have quite a bit of pent up aggression there, and there‚Äôs no way that‚Äôs healthy.
---
Use the app lfg it‚Äôs better
---
Like I said, ITS A CHEESE. Its cheap, it gets the job done.
---
It isn‚Äôt going against any of Bungie‚Äôs rules, and they would‚Äôve figured out a way to prevent this if they hated it that much.
---
Some players want it for endgame PvE where it‚Äôs best, but they suck at PvP, so does it seem that unreasonable. Besides, it‚Äôs one less teammate throwing in comp with 3 grenade launchers.
---
It‚Äôs not hurting anyone‚Äôs experience, so I don‚Äôt see why it concerns you.
---
I believe that aiming for the head has become instinctive to me. üòê
---
Colossal oof
---
Again, use LFG lmfao.
---
Destiny 2 LFG Discord.
---
Idk why people don‚Äôt use lfg. It‚Äôs so easy.
---
Not a cheese, it‚Äôs cheating. How would they patch this? They can‚Äôt prevent you from matching against other teams, the game doesn‚Äôt know that you‚Äôre doing something scummy. I‚Äôm not good at pvp, still did the quest tho. Ur argument is weak
---
This post is like an onion.
---
It has so many layers and it brings me to tears.
---
Glad to see people get restrictions like this. If you play on Xbox I report so many people for horrible connections.
---
It‚Äôs decent but it isn‚Äôt optimal.
---
Yes all pinnacle weapons are
---
okay thanks, I‚Äôm just trying to get some opinions on different things bc i‚Äôve been using lmgs for a good while and i just wanted to see what else is good or better to use. I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs a no on wardcliff also?
---
That‚Äôs just Jerry
---
I can‚Äôt see the quest in shaxx‚Äôs menu, and i don‚Äôt have that on my inventary üò´  what‚Äôs wrong?
---
It‚Äôs not in your inventory it‚Äôs in your pursuits
---
okay, maybe closer to a week, but don't you have a clan or something that could 4 stack with you?
---
Will do, thx.
---
I got it ty guys. Got it after another game of comp (was gonna log out and back in after the game incase)
---
Oh! Nice! Thank you
---
Recluse is a big yes.
---
Redrix is kind of like recluse in a way, but a little less forgiving. You have to play really passively since you can be outgunned, but once you have the perk activated you mow through guardians. There‚Äôs a lot of recoil and you have to get precision kills to keep the perk going, so recluse is a lot easier to use,
---
My clan doesnt do comp much. There are like 2 people who are gd, but they just got recluse and dont want to go bk tk hell
---
It‚Äôs still strong
---
That‚Äôs 2 tactical nukes
---
I'm a returning player I haven't played the game in a year and I'm REALLY confused about all the hundreds of editions and passes with this game. Can someone help me? I had the base game and then the expansion pass (which seems like doesn't include all the expansions).
---
So what dlc should I get if I want to power up play the new raid etc.?
---
what is the difference between annual pass and forsaken dlc? what is the difference between the forsaken deluxe and the standard?
---
Something I want to know is, is the city slowly being rebuilt? I feel like its a lot more intact than it was at the start of the game but I can‚Äôt tell.
---
Can always get an outragious fortune from our big blue titan boi at the tower.
---
When you finally beat flawless arunak
---
That dude with the Nova was the real party crasher +1
---
ultimate disrespect hahaha
---
Dattos raid titles should be silver
---
Also played against members of REZO in Trials back in D1. Let's just say that I got absolutely wrecked.
---
It's a destiny 2 meme?
---
You're serious aren't you?
---
Maybe?
---
When in doubt, blade barrage it.
---
Any videos of this match?
---
Titan is a moon 
---
Or am I missing something here?
---
I'm jealous of where you live! LoL
---
If it helps, all of my favorite stuff in this pic came from your part of the globe!

Ace, Malfeasance, and the Titan Banner came from the Ukraine via Etsy.

The personalized class poster came from the UK via eBay Europe.

Well, Titan is the largest moon of Saturn...

A literal worm god was killed by regular bullets
---
Maybe we should all just calm down a little and enjoy some crucible
---
I still have some of those shells from when factions were a thing. So if they ever come back then yeah that will help you get those.
---
Datto: "Welp, I will no longer stop for people. That guy ruined it."
---
I see your Ouch and I'll raise you an OUCH
---
thats because her core i9 is thermal throttling
---
But like... Recluse is easy... Really easy.
---
In a boss fight scenario prospector is only edged out by aggresives like you said or anarchy+mountaintop combo in terms of DPS, but it has relatively low total damage output due to the reserves being small. Wendigo is a good stepping stone till you get a hold of one of the better alternatives, and is the best heavy GL for ad clear.

Shoulder charge would like a word x3

ü¶Äü¶Ä Lord of wolves is gone ü¶Äü¶Ä

Ahhhh, my nigga!  
---
Congrats, man!

I went straight from charging my fighting lion catalyst to trying to get Mountaintop in The Crucible. I wouldn't go as far as saying I've mastered the weapon but it definitely feels comfortable now. My k / d is still above 1 and I'm getting 15 to 20 kills a game. Which is an average match for me without fighting lion. I dont think its a terrible gun or strategy for the crucible. It just has a steep learning curve.

Little bit, took me 15 tries, but then got it 3 times in a row my 15th, 16th and 17th completion. RnG is a bitch
---
That was also a reuse.
---
Go into last wish with Kalli, in the back there's a pool of knee deep water, good luck
---
Oh god, Xur's got hentai, it's all over his face!
---
ixisblaygor PSN, I'll help you.
---
Sure is.  Well don't feel too bad, I still can't get 1k to drop for the life of me.
---
As I also pointed out below the link. Hence also my further comment about intellectual property.
---
I love how you just tried killing it like how Guardians kill Dregs
---
Take a look at www.solarian.net
---
You can come say hi at www.solarian.net/discord if you want to meet people first :)
---
Wow. I mean i choke already!!! Can't imagine what would happen with BYF
---
Everver$e set, arms are Liar's Handshake.
---
I hate it when dipshit ruins the fun.
---
Well, I‚Äôm sorry? I do care but thought it‚Äôd be funny
---
If you want.
---
I wave to anyone who waves
---
I support byf being the new speaker
---
it's a fusion shotgun, that's about it.
---
good job justice man
---
Not yet
---
I have the lumina and I'm really enjoying it.
---
The 25 precision headshot final blows are what are getting me.
---
I especially love in crucible when my guardian does the entire animation for putting down a rift and then doesn‚Äôt put down a rift
---
If I can be honest, this joke is stale as hell from overuse. It was funny at first now it‚Äôs just beating a dead horse. Sorry
---
Thats what I said. Thats not what you said. It is NOT from the warmind expansion. It was in the base game when it launched. So it is not from the Warmind expansion, it is from the Base Game.
---
No word...
---
r/2real4me
---
Heh
---
Sad reacts only :(
---
Was gonna say, 1'x6" is pretty small, my mouse would keep flying off the pad!
---
atleast it balances out things a bit, spectral blades cant match to any super that can parry the attack.
---
Either that or I'll try to use my throwing knife, and it'll pull me halfway across the map to stab the enemy. Range doesn't matter.
---
That guy sucks, quit destiny to play division 2, now any time any leak for d2 arises he blows it out of proportion to milk the game he abandoned for some click bait money, what a lame. Pick a side and stay on it.
---
Boffa deez NUTS
---
I have had this happen to me at the same time that I was blinking. He Yeeted me right off the cliff like 50 meters away.
---
The Dreaming City is stuck in a time loop, every 3 weeks the curse resets, every week there is a different mission pertaining to the curse on the city, on the final third week there is a dungeon that will open up in the convergence under the city. Not going to spoil anything beyond that.Hopefully that helped
---
I play 400 DPI so that‚Äôs like a 45 degree turn for me lol
---
I thought u were gonna do the glitch where u can get on the other side of the wall
---
Jfc man. That was intense!
---
That‚Äôs what i did, it worked for me.
---
Ok
---
Idk, just not seeing lots of people using it
---
It‚Äôs back.
---
damnit, if i wasn't broke i would gild you for that
---
Yway
---
Its Like a necessity for most raid encounters. Especially CoS
---
Sweet just did and it worked
---
Ornaments is being sold by eververse.
---
Wait, so is that actually you or just a joke?
---
Man, that One eye'd Mask and last word **crutch** combo just shows you how OP they can be.
---
Is it? Don‚Äôt do too many raids that often, thanks for telling me though
---
IS IT COMING IN THIS UPDATE???
---
Wait, can we still do Iron Banner matches?
---
No problem
---
Honestly do what the first guy said.  Play to win.  Fuck kills and being showy.  Use what YOU know your good with.  Play to win and when you are truly impressed by someone whether they are on your team or the enemies team. Send them am invite and a "great match bro'.  That's how I got my recluse.  And how I helped my buddie get his.  Also.  Remember to breathe when your in those tense gunfights.   That's what helped me the most
---
You can continue your quest progress when it comes back, I suppose?
---
Thanks. There‚Äôs just a million things going on every week and it‚Äôs tough to go there when I have bow/GL/Sniper kills to get.
---
We only have 3 pulse rifles though?
---
Back in the Dark Ages, we had no guardians.
---
Only light bearers, and they were all kinds of people.
---
Thanks guys for the advice :) I‚Äôll be looking into a new clan.
---
Our lord and saviour returns 
---
Now patiently waiting for nlb
---
Hmm how do we get it?
---
Casio calculator
---
Boomer:  What? Throw a grenade at me?  Eat this, Guardian!!!
---
Yep
---
Dark ages, the drifter won‚Äôt shut up about it
---
Bad juju is out if I‚Äôm not mistaken.
---
How?!
---
The bad juju is present and achievable, was just watching gladd unlocking it.
---
Quest steps?
---
Looks like they kept its exotic perk intact on paper. How does it feel?
---
The reward is the content, my friend.
---
I intend on getting Forsaken once I have enough moneys, but right now I'm stuck with base game + Osiris and Warmind. 
---
Is Forsaken worth the $40? 
---
(also thank you)
---
The FAQ covers this.
---
&gt;Please note: The current $40 price of Forsaken is not affected by the additional year 1 content that it is bundled with. This was the normal price of Forsaken before and it will continue to be this.
---
Year 1 content is going to be free, so to prevent people from buying DLC and not being able to play the game until it is free, year 1 content is included free with every purchase of Forsaken.
---
Me:)
---
People already have it meanwhile i still cant even get on the servers lmao
---
yeah I got mine like 15 minutes ago, quite disappointing
---
Top tier shitpost
---
I just came back to D2 after a long break and am completely overwhelmed with how much there is to do now!
---
Oh, OK. Is that why items have a 'max infusion' stat?
---
What do you need to do to get it?
---
Man I love seeing the same post over and over again
---
Feels like a reskinned scout with pulse fire
---
Disappointing? How?
---
How??
---
18 tributes
---
Knight: hey check out how hard i can pee
---
Knight :PWWWWWWWWWWWSFFFFFFFFFFFFFFSHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
&gt;or is Forsaken worth purchasing given the 2 months I will be able to play it.
---
I know you said you understood the elements of structure, but you do not. They don't arbitrarily take away DLC lol, you'll still have Forsaken no matter when you buy it!
---
I had alot of resources, and had 6 tributes already unlocked, the ones i was missing i just bought then i just ran through the quest solo
---
You could buy just forsaken on cdkeys.com, that's how I got mines.
---
Baby boomers making posts about how millennials are ruining industries
---
Jesus that‚Äôs insane. I play a wicked game and I swear I got 50 only to find out I got 28. Such a downer lol
---
I'll try it out, thanks. Is there an ideal one I should keep an eye out for eventually?
---
Well yes but no
---
Right? Cool for me but I know I would've been furious if I were them
---
Rampage is always a favorite, and anything that boosts stability is a plus
---
If you don‚Äôt have any auto rifles you like, you could try farming gambit for the gambit auto rifle and pulse rifle as they are both kinetic and good for pve. The pulse is also very good in pvp
---
Bad juju last quest step i did it solo cause i can lul and yea its pretty easy
---
Bottom tree is absolutely broken when you can chain this many just by clicking in their general direciton
---
There's always clans willing to help anyone through it. I can recommend one if you're on PS4.
---
Sooooo no lord of wolves nerf?
---
You use the good stuff and people complain about it being a crutch. Use the stuff no one is using and you‚Äôre still a scrub? I don‚Äôt get people. Way to opinionated over a video game. The whole point of the game is to use what you find fun.
---
So where does the bridge actualy go?
---
I‚Äôm sure most people can read Roman numerals.
---
Oh sry, I meant another ideal auto rifle while I'm using this one. An exotic, for instance. Or maybe something from an activity, like Crucible or Gambit. PvE-oriented, of course.
---
I know? I did say ‚Äúthat‚Äôll teach me for being impatient‚Äù Lmao, its not like I‚Äôm over here demanding my money back. 
---
It‚Äôs a semi serious rant, chill my dude.
---
That Osiris SMG was an ad mower for sure! Hell it's still in my vault, even after the sandbox changes of Forsaken practically killed it. Still didn't have the heart to break it down.
---
I didnt dismantle anything from these packages it's just the cloak I'm missing
---
‚ÄúA side should always be taken, little light. Even if it‚Äôs the wrong side.‚Äù - Exo Stranger
---
ok thanks, only briefly heard of that sub. will check it out
---
They stated the Lord of Wolves nerf was coming in late July. [See the Bungie news post.](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47948)
---
Haha glad I could help, amazing what one can do while procrastinating at work! Good luck!
---
That's exactly why I'm on Reddit, haha! Thank you so much, kind person!
---
Braytech Winter Wolf, Duty Bound, and Scathelocke come to mind but they're older ones.
---
No it ain't pal. Instead, Bungo decide to 1) nerf Menagerie chest 2) nerf outbreak tactics using nanites 3) nerfed 21% delerium killing tally proc 4) nerf menagerie Gauntlet telesto/GL cheese
---
Something makes PVP unbearably unfun, broken to the nth degree? Bungo "I sleep"
---
Something makes PVE more enjoyable and easier? Bungo "REAL SHIT"
---
Tired of it tbh.
---
Lol, sorry....looking through my collections, The BrayTech Winter Wolf was a beast (and looks cool...get it from packages on Mars) will cover your mid-long range auto rifle, Tigerspite is another great Precision Frame you can farm in the Dreaming City
---
https://www.bungie.net/en/Profile/ReferAFriend?code=RAF-MDJ-PYA-XL4
---
If you are on Xbox, use this link to earn us both cool stuff
---
Bygones... I think I dismantled that x_x. Well, I'll have to remember to store it in the vault next time I'm not sure about a gun. Pulse rifles aren't really my thing, but this one looks cool.
---
Yep. Someone pointed out above that my comment didn‚Äôt age well. Was I wrong in thinking they said they would nerf today or is that just some shit I came up with?
---
i may have had a tool to give me prices from path of exile on its an autohotkey thats like the only thing and i get banned but like it doesnt do anything of course they dont know that just wow imo and you cant dispute bans. i literally never talk in chat mainly becuiase chat is dead in that game
---
Most of mine still are! I switched to PC around Warmind so I knew they weren't much use anymore but I still love em. A couple are still MW'd so they show the kill counters. 
---
I've been considering pulling the SMG back out actually. I have that Gambit Prime SMG on my Hunter but I wanna use the sniper in my Energy slot and I *think* the Curse of Osiris SMG is close enough to the Gambit SMG that it'll work as a fill-in.
---
You need to complete your chalice side steps first
---
Yes there is. You can play the quest as normal. After you complete one bounty and gain access, they will appear in your inventory. They do count and are there, you have to actually progress in the quest far enough for tributes to be unlocked.......
---
You only need to do it three times if you do the puzzles.
---
I still use grav lance in sometimes in crucible, fun seeing everyone turn into black holes.
---
*we‚Äôve broken the hive*
---
thanks! i see that prospector does a lot of damage in its own weapon class.
---
Wait how do u get it 
---
I need it
---
It does not.
---
It's only Leviathan or Menagerie gear.
---
&gt; Get your salt ready for the next gun you can blame for trash kda.
---
It's like you didn't even view the link I posted. That is called a busted gun. It's OP as fuck. One single burst can take out any roaming super. 
---
&gt;something is always the king.
---
Yeah and that's why people complain about it you ape, people like balance in PVP, not "something" being "king".
---
Alright I just thought since the throne room is on the Leviathan then it would maybe count.
---
That‚Äôs a pretty cool Nechrochasm.
---
Except it got datamined like a month ago
---
I really wish you could set up a separate button for ‚Äúmelee skills‚Äù on hunters. Every one of them can be awkward/annoying to use (or not use when you want it to).  I think the worst offenders are the throwing knife throwing abilities, which will either forcefully teleport you to do a stab when you really wanted to throw them, or they will throw them when you‚Äôre trying to stab someone in the face.
---
The range on the abilities never seem to matter. The game rolls a dice to see which one will proc it feels like. I‚Äôve tried punching someone from a foot away only for my knife to go catapulting over their heads, or stabbing them from like 10 feet when I am trying to nail that throwing knife.
---
r/iamverysmart
---
Nice! Almost there. Used like all of my mats and currency but it was worth it! Lol
---
How can we be sure the light-monger's dead? Keep shooting solider.
---
To bad there was a death in there... Nah looking at your stats your a rather skilled player, especially skilled use of supers it seems. Kudos mate
---
Wut?
---
Windows of Oppurtunity is by far one of my favorite episodes of the series.
---
What does it do?
---
My legendary shards have been feeling it man
---
Well yes, they did change the entire weapon system, but for better gameplay. Changing the slot of a weapon seems like an extremely drastic change
---
Nigga what?
---
Extends the duration of the string of curses perk
---
GOOD WORK, GUARDIAN! YOUR LIGHT IS STRONG!
---
almost like this is a massive game with hundreds of interlocking parts
---
Your first comment in 7 months is straight salt
---
Isn't that hot?
---
Extremely.
---
I just posted this on my clans discord, thanks for the info.
---
I wouldn't know, but it's supposed to be a monster in PvE, too.
---
They've announced that when shadowkeep releases, all Y1 becomes free to play for anyone.
---
Ahh yes I was thinking of doing this too but my money...
---
Haven't shards been garbage for months now after the nerf?
---
He's got the Scarab Gun!
