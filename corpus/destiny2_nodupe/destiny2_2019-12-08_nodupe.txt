Mithrax comes to the tower ‚Äúdamn its nice to finally be accepted‚Äù

---
Ikora and Zavala comes up ‚ÄúWelcome‚Äù

A random hunter comes up ‚ÄúI fuckin dare you to be the hunter vanguard‚Äù
---
Mithrax ‚Äú....‚Äù
---
I guess it's the Vinegaroo. I don't really like that one, I prefer the Legendary version which I can't remember the name of
---
Listen man. If your complaining about not being able to earn everything in eververse you relinquish your right to complain about lack of content
---
Same. Started up about an hour ago for me. Keep having connection issues on ps4 and xbox.
---
Ok so will they all be there or not lol
---
No way, everyone is talking ‚Äúclans‚Äù no, the misconception that you have to be an asshole when you raid is extraordinarily prevalent in Destiny today.  I get it frustrating to teach sometimes but sheesh, you meet some of the worst people in raid parties.  - straight fucking awful.  I personally love helping news peeps to the game.  
---
Then again seeing how Hunters and Titan do nothing but ruthlessly attack each other on here, I dunno what I expect.  OEM and OHK knives... and I just wanna know why they call him saint-14... where did the other 13 go?
---
Correct
---
Will Xenophage be available after the season ends as well?
---
OH! AND THE MOST IMPORTANT PART! HOW THE FUCK COULD I FORGET!!!
---
.
---
Sparrows on mercury! \o/
---
Big dead
---
That‚Äôs still aim assist
---
Traveler come protect us
---
Take your time and don‚Äôt kill the gate lord in a instant after the hydras. What me and my friend found is that the more time has past helps. So we gate lord very low and just wait around for the hydras. Once all the hydras are dead we wait for the message ‚ÄúGatelord is escaping‚Äù then we kill him and rise and repeat. Then the overlord spawns.
---
Nah. It‚Äôs all server side.
---
Damn hombrew dm‚Äôs
---
What a bummer
---
Let me pull out my magical crystal orb

He is trying to get the one at Hellmouth for the triumph
---
Bro, I‚Äôve been in the Army with a combat MOS for ten years and raiding with strangers makes me anxious.  Raids aren‚Äôt fun with strangers.  You‚Äôre 100% right.  I‚Äôm glad you brought it up and I‚Äôm glad people are offering their help.
---
[deleted]
---
Thanks for this üôÇ
---
Dregs promise. Now it‚Äôs a power weapon. Nothing else has changed.
---
They keep making all these changes without removing old things that never got worked on it‚Äôs weird to me.
---
Pobrecito...
---
Not very skillfull indeed but I get being proud of little achievements, we need those along the road to get better. That said you're gonna get those sarcasms because this shit here is so cheesy and toxic it took the crown off OEM titans even if it's in only one game mode. Good luck though !
---
I‚Äôm guessing you haven‚Äôt seen the season of dawn trailer or don‚Äôt quite understand that saint might be wondering why tf people have his helmet
---
Imagine expecting groundbreaking and fresh new content for 10$. Be happy were getting 3 brand new exotics along with SoD. If you cant be happy paying 10$ for 2 months of content then go play something else
---
Have you gotten multiple glittering keys

More trash/weeds than flowers lol more like, the needle in the haystack.  But the hay is radioactive and covered in AIDS. Without a magnet in sight üòÇ

I have been visiting eris multiple times. The first mission went of without a hitch. Now however, i cant progress to the second mission

Guts built like a titan but most certainly a Hunter no warlock sir

---
Sure thing
---
Ironic to post this with that cake icon up there \^
---
From what I've been told its range is better, so damage falloff wont be as much trouble, but honestly for me its mostly the accomplishment of it. Ive never been much of a pvp guy but this season Ive done well enough to get Recluse, Randys, Mountaintop, Lunas, and Im a good bit into the quest for Redrixs broadsword. I also tend to bounce between PC and PS4 so when I get on PS4 doing well with handcannons is waaaay easier
---
EDIT: I play on controller on PC, just to clarify why handcannons would be easier for me on console
---
Yah, that would make the most sense. Doesn't mean it's what Bungie will do ;) but seems like a good bet.
---
Find a Sherpa in the LFG, they're generally accommodating. Just don't be THAT guy who holds it up for others for an absurd amount of wipes (more wipes = higher chance people might end up leaving due to time constraints/frustration), always clarify mechanics you don't understand and learn quickly.
---
Watching videos on the raid aslo shows your willingness to learn.
---
I used to there with ya, been trying to use it more and more.  Still not great at reading at closing proximity though.
---
By no means am I trying to say Novabomb is worse but like, it‚Äôs pretty aids and can still be used even without an exotic. Now if you really wanna bitch about Titan ya gotta bring up the melees.
---
Yeah they arent gonna delete your bountys. They've never done that in the past. Just undying stuff will be gone
---
Started playing for the first time in November, reached 100 season rank about a week ago! Just beat Shadowkeep, mostly messing around now until the new season starts. Stared doing forges recently, got a really nice Blast Furnace that I‚Äôve been really happy with. Otherwise I love my god-rolled Arsenic Bite and the Graviton Lance, which I‚Äôve been trying to find the catalyst for with no luck so far haha. Got introduced to Byf‚Äôs videos recently and now catching up on all the lore!
---
Thicc
---
Looks absolutely awesome and nice choice of weapons btw!! Could you possibly post another version of this thats a bit brighter? Hard to make out the details of some of it, thanks
---
I never played Destiny 1, but I just recently finished all the Prophecy weapons and the small Saint quest chain. Just in time for me to understand all the excitement heh
---
I'm not hating on hunters but God have I been instantly solo blade barraged way too many times by someone who got startled
---
Needs more auto rifles XD
---
He‚Äôs not hacking, that‚Äôs just a preview for the new titan exoctic for the season of Dawn! They need something to make up for the nerf to the OEM as bottom tree striker!
---
Maybe 80% of the time you're not utilizing dodge correctly. Some really good exploits have been found in season of the undying mods coupled with dodge. You don't see warlocks surviving shoulder charge or even fist of havoc, but a well built hunter can with a bit of skill in timing their dodge
---
Try r/sharditkeepit
---
Can‚Äôt get the Hand cannon ones because they don‚Äôt show up but I‚Äôll try pulse rifles, thanks!
---
I ask bc this is my first time being back in D2 and I was assuming someone would know who‚Äôs been around for awhile. Thanks for the meaningless comment tho lmfao
---
Dude, just go to its throne world and kill him there.
---
Justice üòÇ
---
thanks! i‚Äôll make sure to check it out:)
---
You can actually technically kill with well but it has no practical use in crucible
---
ikr
---
Errrr I'm honestly not sure about this anymore
---
its an argumentative fallacy where you basically invalidate what someone says for x reason
---
Thank you! Ye that is something I can do and I will make a mobile version too.
---
While doing it as a nightfall on 950 difficulty with inexperienced players the pace seems right. There is even some time between "there is no powered crystals in here" and "we go with that plan". And a solution is logical for someone in this desperate situation when the enemy must be stopped at all costs. It's just the wartime logic that's isn't very good for us living in a time of peace.
---
That's the truth! I don't ever use handheld supernova because the super is kinda booboo. Fist of havoc has a ridiculous aerial kill percentage, but nova warp falloff range is ridiculously short. I've blinked into a group of hunters on a point, and had all jump away from me as I novawarped, and kill me before they hit the ground
---
It will look grate when its done :)
---
Do the forges in the lighthouse on mercury, once you're halfway through the weapons you'll find out for yourself why he's so legendary üòâ
---
NF can actually be better or worse depending on your playstyle. NF basically has double the range so you can engage from a longer range as compared to the Lunas Howl which, has higher stats in handling as well as reload speed thus being a more forgiving gun to use.
---
Ultimately both guns are similar but should be used in different situations.
---
Since you won't load in until everyone loads, it highly varies. Most of the time I bet there's that one guy in a match with a 5400 RPM HDD
---
But by myself, from the "Press Enter to start" screen of launching the game it takes like 33s for me to get to the character select screen with a Samsung 970 Evo SSD (tested it just now lol). And probably &lt;15s when loading into a planet (I haven't tested this but I'm sure its around that)
---
Definitely not near GTA V levels of torture loading times
---
Yeah, with an artifact mod that is going away at the end of the season.
---
This fits just perfectly
---
[yurr](http://imgur.com/gallery/HaLS0vf)
---
This is why no one uses it
---
If a shotgun shot and a punch can kill you in a super, somethings wrong. Nova warp needs a damage resistance buff, but I'm fine with it not having a ton of range. You can mess with people using blink anyways.
---
To be honest, I don't think we're living in the timeline where the servant of the Light publicly arrives in our solar system first.
---
If you're trying to raid and you're on PC I'd recommend the lfg discord but for PC and console you should be able to use the destiny companion app
---
Jade rabbit to the face
---
I use it for 6s. Where it really shines, as procced it will shred an entire team.
---
It's problem is that it's not a great dueling weapon, so isn't really suitable for comp.
---
I would also say the best roll is polygonal, ricochette and handling masterwork.
---
The handling is really what let's it down. Polly and ricochette make it virtical and sorts the stability and range out.
---
Handling masterwork is a must imo.
---
Tldr brilliant for 6s, bit meh for 3s.
---
It's a humorous trope. I'd advising Googling *that's what she said jokes*, someone else will have explained it far better than I will.    
---
Then, once you're done, watch The Office, and watch Michael Scott use that trope at every opportunity.
---
Either that or look up lore daddy byf on youtube. He covered the topic and its really amazing
---
So, I can‚Äôt speak for everyone else, but my Titan I rarely look like I know what I‚Äôm doing when I shoulder charge, my Titan gets eaten alive by the Sliding shotgun folks.  Granted not gonna say ‚Äúnerf shotgun slides‚Äù because it‚Äôs just a game and a technique is a technique.  I don‚Äôt think Titans are ‚ÄúOP‚Äù or else everyone would use them.  I think hunter is the most played class.  - can‚Äôt base it on facts, just from my observations.  Frustrating? Yup.  OP? No.
---
I think because voidlight is a power source put into a crystal form, not just an explosive. The hive uses almost the same crystals in their summoning rituals on Mars and destroying them disrupts the portals.
---
Is the discord lfg used for consoles as well? Because I have discord I‚Äôm just on PlayStation
---
Sanctified Mind
---
That one requires you to suck the knowledge quickly or you're stuck there forever, assuming your team is five newbies and one sherpa
---
Sweet!!! I'll be on the look out for it üòâ thanks
---
Wife's boyfriend?
---
^^^^ my name is bud is by far my go to lore channel
---
Do you think the damage buff will be enough to make it good in PvE?
---
Not as rough as the title of this post. 
---
(Just kidding!!!)
---
As though that's much better. It's basically normal difficulty instead of "Press Button To Instant Win!"
---
Today I almost quit destiny 2 after weeks preparing myself with good weapons, catalysts, mastering gears and learning from guides all the tactic for garden and after a few minutes the raid leader dies beside me and treated me to boot because I don't res him asap. Raids toxicity was the reason I leave gw2 and wow.
---
Hey, Tarrabah and Anarchy aren‚Äôt going anywhere but the title is so good prioritization imo. Plus drop rates are going up next season.
---
Guilty. Sabaton does that to a man, and is a necessary sacrifice
---
Are trying to imply that chaos reach is viable? Because its literally one of the worst supers in the game and does have the least armor in the game. Its good for 1 or 2 kills max on average.
---
Someone buy that hunter a drink, he damn well deserves it.
---
‚ÄúPlease come back for next season and give us $10.‚Äù

I haven‚Äôt had success using it, I‚Äôve found myself switching back to Thorn or Ace for my exotic, but it might end up being viable

Hey... Mk.44 will be the perfect counter lol.

You can only buy 2 legendary frames per week. After tuesdays reset you'll be able to buy 2 more

I would ABSOLUTELY be interested!

This season finally allowed me to hit 2100 by myself! I got mountaintop and randy in one swoop and a few hundred away from revoker which I will grind out this weekend. I made the switch from Xbox to pc with the launch of Shadowkeep and I gotta say..... The game has never been in a better place. Still lots of room for improvement but Destiny is the best franchise I have been a part of since WoW. Looking fo ward to the road ahead.  Being trials back!

I completely agree with you. There are ways of dealing with this on my end that can correct for poor-performing questions üëç

FWIW, you can turn down or fully mute game dialog in settings.

I'm really glad you liked it! I put a lot of work into it!

Thanks:)
---
Tbh I kinda wish they would also be nerfed. 1hko's that don't require any precision or thought are lame. I'm okay with 1hko's sometimes but if you don't even have to get a headshot, you should at least have to do something to activate extra damage first or maybe wear a specific exotic.
---
Just to let you know you spelt guardian wrong.
---
I only came here to check it out, and it looks like just more of the same. I really don't get how ppl get excited over being drip fed new content while being hung upside down so the devs can laugh and take your money....willingly. I guess there's a game for everybody out there
---
The undying servant
---
The vex: who decided to fuck with our time
---
Ummm I got every exotic and pinnacle except not forgotten. 960  raw PL on titan and hunter. Just missing gloves for my warlock. Too bad all my pinnacles are done this week.
---
HEEEEEEEEEEEEERRREEES JOHNNY!
---
You‚Äôre honestly an amazing help thanks so much
---
Nothing else other than the feature I asked about unfortunately
---
Listen, first things first, try doing an ordeal of 920 and see what you get. That may work.
---
But otherwise, you need to make your score card say x3.00 or higher imo.
---
Do this by putting on match game and extinguish, and then increase the handicap until you get to around that. Find yourself a fireteam, and do the nightfall. The whole thing. Sometimes the beginning of nightfalls don‚Äôt count for score, so just rush through that. Good luck, guardian.
---
I did tat to my friends all the time in D1, still do in D2.

I like the purple crayons. They taste the best.

Knives 1 hit to the head and tripmines stuck and 1 hit

Nice Halo: Reach reference :)
---
This is the issue I have with 99% of Destiny's quests objectives.  They actively promote selfish play in a game that's supposed to be about teamwork.
---
Especially exotic and pinnacle quests.
---
I had three of my team camp in front in portal once. Was pretty annoying
---
Ouch I felt that one
---
"Don't take the piss, Boris."
---
Lol! I forgot you could do this, in destiny 1 pvp on the vehicle maps I made a short video of me killing my team. It is shitty but it was a purely accidental but great trick.
---
Right! My chest got a loan in it afterwards üòÇ
---
o mb  i thought you di but either way still hilarious! I look forward to seeing that name!
---
Ok
---
Sparrow racing is what got me hooked on Destiny
---
That a range masterwork? And id prob keep it
---
That lunas howl duel at the end was extremely painful. 
---
Great revenge story none the less 10/10
---
Pretty good as far as autos go
---
Yes sir üëå
---
Got it last night, 2nd ever run a month later from the first lol. This thing is a monster.
---
It will be available ingame on Tuesday
---
I‚Äôve convinced myself that Taeko and her team were dead the entire time and Savathun was just trying to lure our guardian deeper into the chamber. 
---
That sounds way more compelling than a squad of nine getting picked off one by one and watching the wizard rip the light out of my best friend. (Grinded my fucking strikes the last week possible for the undying title)
---
Prophecy weapons are coming back next season
---
Haha, for the greater good!
---
Tim to blow bubbles
---
Thanks legend. Don‚Äôt have many people to talk D2 with. So I thought I‚Äôd share with the reddit community.
---
Some of the marines in the game are named after Bungie developers. This one is named after Deej, the community manager for D2.
---
Faxx
---
Oh nice! Randy‚Äôs is a decent choice for gambit, very underrated imo.
---
Bottom tree Nightstalker works wonders my friend.
---
Hard lol'd sadly the OC and I arent in touch anymore
---
I‚Äôm reminding you since the robot didnt
---
I would say he's me(I don't wear that armir or even play Gambit that often ) but when I enter the portal it usually ends with a wipe of the enemy team
---
It's still the same bro ü§£ bungie will never change random drops
---
Ok thanks I‚Äôll never get it because my luck is none existent.
---
Phantasmal fragments and Vex cookies.
---
u/titletoimagebot
---
Thanks :) Maybe the people saying they have it already had the season pass and I just didn't consider that. I was going crazy thinking I had to get the fancy version of Shadowkeep.
---
*depressed INDEED sounds*
---
Everyone gets rekt sometimes. You spawn in, you pop your head out for the first time, you see a scope glint from across the map, the next thing you know you are back on your side.
---
Yeah if you got the deluxe edition than you already own the pass. Otherwise you have to wait and purchase it ingame on Tuesday.
---
R/DestinyFashion would like to see this, I think.
---
Whenever I‚Äôm wearing a full set of invader armor blueberries steal portal but the whenever I‚Äôm playing another role and not equipped to invade at all no one takes portal
---
Started playing last week and only just realized that there even was a minimap
---
Perhaps you should clarify ownership and creator
---
r/bossfight
---
Do you know which class has the best damage resistance?
---
That's so wholesome I'm exited to meet him now
---
Yeah I agree. There‚Äôs just so much lore in Destiny and it‚Äôs just so overwhelming sometimes. Like I have a ton of lore books unlocked but I feel like the amount of reading it would take to soak everything up would take forever.
---
Jesus if he had the moral code of a titan
---
Wow
---
The forces of Darkness are already here.
---
How powerful is toland or osiris compared to baint 14
---
I'm just waiting for the Sparrow that's just two Zavalas pulling you on a rickshaw
---
So you rather keep the same old stale gear and meta
---
Wow that last part I did not know. When battle prowess is recognized it gets fucking recognized. Saint-14 is a literal godsend. So happy to finally be able to see this awesome Titan. Being a 5-year Veteran to Destiny, this does put a smile on my face.
---
Aww, that's nice, dear. But yeah, why would you know? Bungie doesn't know how to write a story or develop characters so they just don't, instead expecting people to read text on a screen. Yeah, no thanks. Shit storytelling and character development in favour of a grindy endgame because that's easier to create. Bungie is made up of some of the laziest developers in gaming today.
---
**BEST**
---
I guess it won't be their throat...
---
Bruh I made this after an infuriating game of momentum control as a warlock. If somebody else has made a similar meme, I haven‚Äôt seen it.
---
Atheon: first time?
---
That's me cause i'm to lazy to do reckoning with the diffrence that i actually kill the enemy team
---
WE are those cool stories.
---
Uh
---
ok true and u can bug my laptop I do NOT do that shot
---
I can‚Äôt wait for us to complete the cycle and give him the gun.
---
I remember the second week of shadowkeep when savathun's was the ordeal the dialogue was different for the sacrifice.
---
Never heard it again but oh well.
---
I‚Äôd love to see a Mara Sov version.
---
 OOOOOHHH WERE HALF WAY THERE
---
For PvP yes
---
LIVINNNN ON A PRAYERRR

I didn't see the sub name and thought this was about a character in the Mandalorian because of the image.
---
I actually prefer the jade rabbit abusers compaired to the ones abusing fighting lion
---
Made it in Blender. Got some of the models from the awesome Destiny Model Rips discord.
---
No but really you can make some amazing shit in the future if you‚Äôre art is this good . Keep up the work.
---
Nope
---
I dont need to test it. Its fact. No sentinel super suppresses in the super.
---
You‚Äôve cursed me bc I smoked for the first time in like a year tonight lmao
---
She sacrificed herself...
---
What‚Äôs your Vouchsafe roll?
---
I don't care about titles, so I did my old quest because I wasn't around for 8-9 months. Let's see, I got Wendigo, Rand's, Recluse, EdgeWise etc. but I think my biggest achievement was Revoker. I barely touch crucible, but with freelancer survival list I encourage my self and got my revoker. I like Ambush scope since D1.
---
Fair enough
---
Thank you sir!
---
None likes you, you dirty invader
---
We need to get to Mars faster to invite the traveler here like right now.

I don't have any sets for Gambit but still invading time to time and did hell of a good job most of the time. Still understand your pain doh. I had o play some reckoning, pehh...

who says I need invader armor when i have truth and thunderlord
---
tell this to my RNG luck regarding random freelance teammates...

that really just sucks

Blast furnace dude. You wont regret it. Its my go it pulse

I played on Hero, the 920 equivalent of a Nightfall. Hero difficulty has matchmaking.
---
I thought it was solar and void as secondary.

Mark my word, it‚Äôs gonna be uldren. He killed Cayde, he inherited the position and the Ace of Spades
---
Says the person who literally just used a ward of dawn while invading
---
this man is playing call of duty mw2 on destiny 2
---
I'll report myself the the authorities :(
---
You guys enjoying your beautiful sunset in the Tower?
---
Had this happen to me three time in the last few weeks. 
---
Either a weapon I had equipped or an armor piece. At least I had nice stats
---
Literally all her screenshots are with this emote, it's so cute. LOL
---
I was pretty sure it was arc but now im questioning it. But either way id assume theyre changing the mods up. As they know people would cry otherwise lol
---
Bruh momento
---
Come and end our suffering oh great dark ones......  I mean what?
---
It‚Äôs like the same exact shit with the human-forerunner wars in halo. So much insane-High level story telling that never makes its way into a visual medium.
---
Id dismantle your exotics simply because that will keep you from having to infuse them. Plus the metas changed so you might not need some of them.
---
Iron moss borne (I think it‚Äôs called) turns the IB set fully gold, just need to find the right cape too.
---
Damn man, Xur was carrying it last week.
---
Fated engrams will no longer exist. All exotic engrams will no longer give duplicates until you have everything, after which they will only give armor.
---
SERIOUSLY!
---
Posting someone else's content without giving him probs is a bullshit move.
---
Have you been to the spider to get the badge? You may need to have finished the previous spider quest line before he may offer it to you.
---
I go bottom tree for Devour effects and insane grenade charge times, you heal after the first melee and all successive kills for a few seconds. Combine it with the Enhancement Rift and you can crush bosses.
---
Looks amazing dude!
---
I bet it will too. Its the only logical choice. It's probably also part of mara's plan since she cant kill the pyramids alone and isnt exactly friendly with the city being all reclusive as she is. She needs an inside man.
---
We've recently gotten into Gambit Prime and are still building our sets, though the majority of the time we don't see anyone wearing Gambit Prime Armour. The perks look pretty amazing so why are people not wearing it?
---
What are the chances I can grind out the last 50 ranks of this season's pass in these final couple of days? lol
---
[When you grind for perfect rolls invader set just to see a blueberry in collector's set entering the portal.](https://imgur.com/a/2pMA14t)
---
Yeah, dragged all my friends to him like the pied Piper of Hamelin and been rolling through strikes with everything exploding since. This week's Black Talon seems like shit by comparison.
---
Which spider questline? Do you know how to get it?
---
Are you saying this like your a decent player, yeah I fucking hate titans. Over powered bullshit. I point blank refuse to use titans in pvp because I prefer to use skill. Most other supers are shut down with a well place shotgun slug but not this little gem of a super, but some one off your skill level obviously knows that. And the little jibe at the end you reiterates your a massive cheese.
---
So it's a roaming ability here you run around throwing knives and not alot of knives at once.
---
After unlocking Eriana's Vow, I decided to take Lucky Pants out of the collection tab to synergize with the gun.
---
One Crucible match later, I unlocked the seasonal reward for a free exotic engram. 
---
It decrypted into Lucky Pants.
---
Fuck me.
---
What is this invader armor you speak of?
---
How long does the grenade reveal enemies?
---
Did you mean for it to kind of resemble Saiyans? Kakarot was Goku‚Äôs name. You could be Karokot or something!
---
IDK maybe 4 sec
---
Do I need to do the forsaken questline first?
---
Nah I'm with you.  If you've got a nice car, you never out stickers on the paint.
---

Well, seeing how you‚Äôll feed the troll I minus well get my fill.  Lol weekend warrior? Really? Just how serious is this game to you? Wow, I gotta admit anyone that would insinuate they were a full time destiny ‚Äúwarrior‚Äù - how can I compete with that? I can tell you‚Äôre smart because you didn‚Äôt create you‚Äôre own defense or argument you used mine.  Silly goose if I wanted my come back I‚Äôd scrap it off your parents face :)  now now, I can see I‚Äôm upsetting you.  Easy to tell by your grammar and how atrocious it‚Äôs getting.  So instead of utilizing your rage typing against you I‚Äôll just let it slide lol  
---
At the end of the day my angry angry little friend, remember that Destiny is just a video game. Titan is just a class, maybe there is something else you could channel your passion Into?

I completely missed out on SoF and SoD but I came back in SoO. This season I got my 3rd, 4th and 5th title, all Pinnacles (except Hush and Redrix) and got all the exotics on my titan and every exotic weapon.

Good gravy, you‚Äôve played enough crucible in the season for 5 resets and haven‚Äôt completed 20 bounties!?!?! Pick up bounties before entering an activity! XP counts! Bounties give XP!

I hope you switched straight to the shiney new one üòÑ

Excessive bravado, lack of knowledge on punctuation rules, low level of speech....I FOUND THE TITAN EVERYONE! Also, helps having the title haha

To be fair though, there does need to be quite of balancing. Hopefully, this new knife will bring balance to the force.
---
Cosmos shell was introduced in curse of osiris so that would've been in season 2.
---
Thanks! But honestly my intentions for playing this way are just too ensure I experience things with my SO who also started playing. I might hit you up on some questions somtime though. Your meme art wasn't mean at all. I know I'm a clueless blueberry or kinder guardian but I am not going to get hurt or upset if someone is unhappy with how I'm enjoying the game. I eventually do want to be a part of the community in this game and part of that is understanding the general feelings and learning the customs of playing together. Reddit helps me understand a little of that and I have watch a couple streamers play destiny but most of what they did was crucible. Honestly it would be nice if I could do Gambit against some bots but if I really decide to get competitive about it I'll just find some YouTube tutorials or something.
---
Talk about a Vex Offensive!

I'd be interested in hearing a couple of objective reasons as to why you believe this.
---
Melee speed aside, I'm fairly certain there's no statistically verifiable data to suggest Warlocks are worse than the other respective classes.
---
You can find people to play with using the [LFG megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bzjpkr/official_lfg_megathread_v_4/) ([or the newer version](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/dudpe1/official_lfg_megathread_v5/)) linked at the top of this subreddit.

Those are oxycodone... ex addict hehe
---
I stopped playing this season and couldn't be bothered to finsh it, hopefully the next season keeps my interest long enough to complete it.
---
Well, obviously it's "fan-art". What else could it be?
---
Oh well that would make it ok I guess. My suggestion is to do the Leviathan underbelly since it gives you alot of year one exotics :)
---
Ok thank you
---
[removed]
---
Thanks I'll try it
---
Stopping posting shit memes about Warlocks, it wasn't funny the first 15 times it was posted.
---
I don‚Äôt think Master chief could kill crota,oryx,siva, or any raid guardian has done
---
Another important thing to know is that the season pass adds temporary content. The special season activity disappears at the end of the season, and most season pass items can't be earned after a season ends.
---
I don't know why everyone connects that scannable to Master Chief. There's literally nothing there other than "yo its an old Guardian who had a ton of light but got tired of fighting"
---
There's not one detail to suggest it's master chief, let alone it ignores the obvious facts that Master Chief wasn't a guardian and had no light. He was just an enhanced super soldier in a crazy advanced suit of armor.
---
At least you're admitting this. MynameisByf made some videos about him recently, if you wanna know the lore, go check them out :)
---
Halo 5? Never heard of it.
---
That's the one where the Composer somehow captured a copy of Cortana and turned her into a real human but didn't make her some kind of all-powerful evil empress and she just continued being her normal self but in actual human form.
---
*Right??*
---
You should be able to. I‚Äôd say Give the free version a shot first
---
Just run the strike all the way through it will be faster . Fighting lion gets primary ammo so you always have ammo for it. It was pretty fast just only use it until you get to the boss.
---
I feel like we wont get any resolution until the next year
---
I think it is done, but I guess technically we don't know that for sure.
---
Lol, bro, there's like 8000 grammatical and spelling errors on that page. 
---
Might get some hits for being cheap, though.
---
I mean if you buy shadow keep it comes with the season
---
Even good titans don't like it.
---
It's happening oh no well let's hope we can tern into guardians
---
Last Wish Raid, Shuro Chi encounter. Rally banner right there, use top tree nightstalker Hunter with Rigs to tether all the mobs and just go to town. Around 80-90 kills per run (3ish min)
---
Also finished Graviton Lance catalyst in about 15 minutes there as well
---
Menkind
---
Well the campaigns are mostly for the story only now so if your into that I'd suggest to play them. They removed the exotic rewards form all of the year one and two quests. Amanda holiday in the tower will have the vanilla story quests. Some of them are required to start a couple exotic weapon quests though. There should be a new players guide pinned to the top of this sub or the dtg sub it has a ton of new info on what's changed.
---
Does not matter. The season passes are "self contained," meaning they don't require anything from the two DLCs. 
---
As the other commenter said, Shadowkeep comes with a pass for the season you buy it during. Also, unlike the passes, Forsaken and Shadowkeep do go on sale every now and then.
---
Nope has to public my dude
---
no it‚Äôs Solar and Void they said so on livestream.
---
The artists for destiny are actually insane. Think back to the cryptoglyph or Deathbringer mission in Shadowkeep (if you have Shadowkeep) The green contrasts perfectly with the black pyramid. It looks amazing.
---
Idk, even her happy side talks about death and suffering a lot...
---
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any rapid fire pulses in the kinetic slot  other than a blue one,  maybe there‚Äôs one with QuickDraw from y1,  I can‚Äôt remember.

that would be terrifying

If you were on Xbox i would just do it for you lol

~~Correct. By lore standards, Oryx could only be defeated by Light, so Guardians used that light to beat him. Since Master Chief isn't a Guardian wielding light, he would lose, and possibly be taken.~~

Ghost says that Master Chief was a Guardian of even greater Light, so technically he could clap Hive Gods.

That moment when you're trying to slow as best as you can the enemy team wiping them on every single invade but some ape that died 4 times against bots decide to steal the portal just to die 2 seconds later and then lose the match
---
That's because literally everyone she knew was killed. You and Cayde are the only people she's interacted with other than vex and fallen in like 500 years.
---
[An example of what they look like.](https://i.imgur.com/AaLZuM4.jpg)
---
&gt;It‚Äôs any powerful reward you see after you hit 900 light.
---
And conveniently, they are even titled "challenge" in game!
---
Voidlock since beta D1,  I feel ridiculously overpowered.
---
The vex offensive does not count for this, Iv tryed it and it does for other things for the moon but not this for some reason
---
Do you have a trust from gambit? That‚Äôs what I used, hardly even thought about aiming...
---
Yes. If you have more than one character be sure to claim the rewards on all of them. Some can only be claimed once but the armor and stuff can be claimed on each character
---
Johnathans whole role was to be the ultimate gentleman. Joseph also is a gentleman you just see it less and only with Suzy q near the end but by jotaro it‚Äôs all gone
---
Yes. And also when you wait in a corner to walk behind the enemy for a bit before one punching them followed by teabag. But yes, I agree, flanks and strategy are part of it too.
---
Go to your collection and then gambit armor you can find the armor there, you need to do a quest first with the synthitazier
---
You on PC?  Want help?
---
are you playing on 144hz aswell?
---
"Pew, Pew mother fucker!" - Shaxx probs.
---
I fucking love hip firing on arc mode with risk runner! It‚Äôs an awesome, practical and easy to get gun!
---
The achievement being bugged is so dumb. It‚Äôs the only achievement I had left and I was looking forward to completing all of them
---
It's done for now, definitely not fully finished. I think the next season could continue it a little bit. The way I see it is after the pyramid visit we got sidetracked by the vex invasions and now osiris needs us to help fix the mess we made killing the undying mind then after that maybe we will return to shadowkeep stuff. I have absolutely nothing to base that off of though so it's more like something I want to happen I guess
---
The hunter's Hunter is Shaxx, That's why he balances Crucible for us

I hope this is a joke

Which main questline are you doing? Red War or a DLC quest?

Ok she‚Äôs said go crazy

‚ÄúMost of us players would like this‚Äù I‚Äôve literally never heard anyone ask this so I don‚Äôt know where your consensus comes from
---
I swaer to god its gonna be saint and Im gonna have to grind that shit cause its gonna be dope
---
A safe assumption to make in any public event is that someone wants it heroic for a quest, the weekly flashpoint, or something else. The process of making it heroic is different per type of event but I know there's a short guide you can likely find.
---
For example, on Tangled shore there's the escaped prisoner drop pods that have a boss emerge from them. You can just unload on the boss and have it be complete real fast, but if you watch, when the icy mist rises the pod has steam vents that you can break for an orb. Throw 3 orbs at the boss and he freezes in place and then its Heroic. You just have to hold the zone around said boss after that.
---
This example is, however, one of the least efficient Heroics because it makes a short event into a much longer one. A few other events have Heroic triggers that can sometimes make the event quicker or at least the same time span. Generally heroic (I think) has higher odds of legendary or exotic drops but it's a minor amount. There are quests and such that specify doing Heroics
---
Literally how many times can a picture be reposted?

So, why make a post if you don't want to engage in any kind of dialogue? My point wasn't that long. It's 310 words to be exact. How that's being seen as comprehensive in any sense is baffling.
---
I was being quite objective throughout. I was citing FFXIV as I had recently played it and it made me think that in Destiny we aren't rewarded for effort or involvement, but simply for participation. That is, I can join a game of Gambit with 20 seconds to go, add nothing to the game and be rewarded with an Exotic Engram. I'm making the point that is not a great way to go.
---
Your post doesn't make sense because it's contradicting the game design that Bungie have employed. If you can't be arsed to read replies, don't post stupid shit on Reddit. That attitude (along with your entitled behaviour regarding Blueberries apparently having to do exactly what you want, when you want just because you can't be bothered to make a 4 stack of your own) goes miles to imply you're quite a lazy, "I'll half-arse it" kind of a guy.
---
If you cant be bothered to read 310 words I'd suggest reading a book. If you think my reply was heated or argumentative or angry.. I don't know what to say to you. It was just a response to your post. I was entering into what I thought was a reasonable exchange. If that bothers you then you're going to be in for a nasty surprise when you enter the real world dude. And if you already are in the real world and older than like 16/17, then wow.

Wait a goddamn minute! Are you saying Master Chief isn‚Äôt a warrior?

Neither of them I am afraid.
---
If youd pointed it right at him you coulda killed him from handcannon range, thats not even an exaggeration. Take a shower please, the salts getting everywhere
---
as opposed to two hands..?
---
I used top tree aces tired because you can dodge to proc your class ability melee and using the melee recharges your dodge so you‚Äôll get it in no time (also doing it in vex offensive counts)
---
*bet*
---
Shaxx is my dad
---
Yeah it's a great gun
---
*Red Legion has entered the chat*
---
Screaming at you not to pick it up.
---
Outside of Golden gun hunters have the highest damage resistance in their supers. So if you're one shotting hunters then you can one shot anyone else.
---
What are you going on abt super damage resist? Im talking about how warlocks and hunters having better supers and melee in pvp. Hunters can be killed by a fucking scout rifle. Try and fsncy stat your way out of that. Bungie just keeps trying to be overly clever with it
---
Crucible is so trash. The scout/pulse rifle meta and ubiquitous team shooting has messed up crucible for me. Maps are too small for 12 people. Qp should be back to 4v4 since comp is 3v3
---
Hunter or Titan

In this very advanced world no information that is digital is safe. These highly classified bounties are are now only hand delivered.

Sort of, according to the Lore: The Guardian is a new generation Iron Lord, our feats just show that we‚Äôve transitioned from Iron Wolf to Iron Lord
---
Yeah i thought about that too but there is always a better option most if not all nightfalls i have played also have arc shield and there are a bunch of good options for solar in the energy slot plus most solo shields tend to be alone so when i do use heavy for solar i just go with my spike grenade launcher to still have DPS' there are so many better options than edgewise for the most part i just run eriana for solar shields plus barrier champions
---
The second half of your comment
---
&gt; its still takes more shots to take a warlock out of dawnblade than saw a hunder in golden gun. Or nightstalker. And even arcstrider after we got a tiny as overshield for mid tree i think it was.
---
After all the legendary shards every exotic NEEDS STRANGE COINS

You should try visiting the farm some time. If you're lucky you can find people playing a game on the field, or sometimes you can get people join in after you've been kicking the ball for a while.

Dude no lie I was literally getting ‚Äútrying to contact destiny 2 servers‚Äù during the full 4 hours I was playing yesterday dude and even at some point I ended up getting booted for a raid cause of connection issues
---
I did thats where I got the idea
---
In her defense, life in the Destinyverse essentially consists of reeling from one existential threat to the next with brief breaks to celebrate holidays... most of which commemorate a prior existential threat.  If she let herself get bent out of shape about every little Cabal invasion or moon haunting, she'd never get anything done.
---
If you have already messed it up, leave the lost sector and come back and it will reset. Then follow a YouTube video of the sequence.
---
Also: Me knowing exactly who Saint-14 is and not caring for the hype at all.
---
I just wantdead cliffs back!!

I am one of those who are happy to see them gone and hope they never return.

Does it get lower effort than this?

After two full days straight of momentum control I hate all the maps right now.
---
Literally the only time I've gotten disconnected randomly when it wasn't something on my end was the other day when the D2 servers took a dump and we were ALL aware it was a problem on their end that day because people lost their shit when the servers were down for several hours. Not everyone is having a problem. If not your router specifically, it could be an issue with your ISP or something going on with the routing.
---
this isn't needed in any capacity. The game is rated T for Teen, not M for mature.
---
That Bovine Champion wiped my fireteam in the Scarlet Keep
---
But do you have Recluse &amp; Mountaintop
---
Tbh I don‚Äôt mind if warlock melee just gets a speed buff, but I think it‚Äôd be cool if it got more range instead, like in D1. Then again, I sometimes get flashbacks to 20km Warlock melee range from D1, so maybe not üòÇ
---
It says I have recluse. and I'm working on my mountaintop
---
Forgot the worn out left analog stick.
---
How the fuck is more words less effort
---
Don't forget to open them in a fireteam! Gives you more xp!
---
So good
---
Hardcore as in similar to hardcore health and damage w/ no radars in other games like Battlefield and CoD and Halo
---
Well then I have no clue
---
Shocked that it's happening at all, but for once I'm going to agree with everyone else in this thread. It's not the Hunter, you just need to keep learning your abilities. If you feel like your Golden Gun is bad with just 3 shots, play Outlaw. You want your knife to do more damage? Practice your moving aim in PvE or keep trying in pvp. Try hitting guardians directly with your nightstalker, anchor will do more damage and slow them immediately. I've heard the Forsaken tree has been the better alternative for Arc hunters since Roaming super armor was removed. You just have to keep trying. Unless you're on console, the game isn't going to play itself on pvp. Invest some mats into mods from Banshee or the Black Armory, make sure to actually apply the right ones based on your loadout. I'm still a pvp trashcan, but I can still dumpster a shotgun titan if I just aim better before he reaches me. Just play smarter, don't immediately assume it's game balance
---
Especially when those extra words jut make my brain hurt more.
---
A bigger damage buff doesn't really make Titans better than Warlocks. It means that at most you want to bring one Titan so everyone else can dance in and out of a bubble. Any other titans than that is overkill. We don't do near comparable damage with any of our supers and almost all of them force us to get into Boss Stomp range. They showed some of the Titan buffs to Sunbreaker in a tweet two days ago. It was painful to watch an entire super bar *barely* almost kill a tier 1 Escalation Protocol boss. Meanwhile Warlocks and Hunters get really cool DPS specs that do a lot of damage and come with exotics that either buff the damage of, or return a lot of super after they use it.
