Same thing with blade barrage

---
Hey everyone it‚Äôs Rick Kahkis here
---
You are not alone in this. The grind is worse then reaching Fabled itself and I just stopped at 20% for the trajectory and double kills. Trajectory wouldn't be as bad if we could finally get Lake of Shadows as Nightfall again for MB but the double kills...
---
I actually love my AoS and use it in my bb Hunter but now I just got my Luna's and I find out that I have shit aim with it and have only gotten 2 triple tap kills (2 headshots to activate the howl and the last shot to kill) in over 130 kills I got with it (this number is based on the progress bar filling up in the quest for not forgotten). With the introduction of recluse I'm noticing a slight increase (very slight but noticeable) in other weapon combinations especially in maps that have both long open spaces and tight corridors.
---
Someone recently did a yt video on the pve end of the perks and it was something like rampage x3 is only a bit higher than swashbuckler x5 both somewhere at the 60-65% then kill clip is 50% and Multikill is 100% at x3 66.6% at x2 and 33.3% at x1.
---
Rampage and Multikill clip being the highest boost, but idk the way swashbuckler works getting the full stack on a melee kill makes it easy to keep the buff up so I prefer it lately with the new Frontal Assault buff
---
I‚Äôm sick of seeing these posts
---
Wow. Chills.
---
*ah I see you are a man of culture as well*
---
Friend of mine gave me advice for that, spam the hell out of Fighting lion in comp, forget rank, forget winning. This is a weapon/playstyle locked kind of quest, treat it as one.  
---

---
I also have had ot completely stop playing Destiny as of late due to this being so RNG based and pubs.
---
A man of culture.
---
If it makes you feel any better, curated rolls never drop as engrams on the ground. They go directly to your inventory (or postmaster if inventory is full) right when the forge ends. What you saw is a visual bug that happens whenever you don‚Äôt have room in your inventory for a forge weapon.
---
Exotic Traveler‚Äôs Chosen make it happen Bungie
---
I finally got my dream weapon earlier: a [full-auto Outlast](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D4EQPGPXsAA78xq.jpg:large). I doubt all the rolls are the absolute best, but Demolitionist with Getaway Artist and some armor pieces with rolls for grenade regen = nigh infinite arc soul, long as there's enemies around. It's disgusting and I love it.
---
How is petras run even possible?!?!
---
Another suggestion is for your friend to purchase the item that will immediately power them up to level 50. From there have them complete the bounties from the Drifter that will give him a complete set of gear (both weapons + armor) at power level 640. These bounties are relatively easy to complete and with them done he should be powerful enough to join you guys in a raid.
---
gotta 4 stack that one or sweat like no tomorrow
---
Can't you give the cats the small gifts in return for legendary loot?
---
Oh my fucking god dude
---
Oh I am now. I literally just wanted to get a little further and complete my milestones at the same time. 15 games. 13 losses. 2 wins.
---
This was a nightmare for me to finish, but I suggest running comp and camping heavy which is what I did.
---
You can do it, man!! I have faith in you!!
---
Yeah I was thinking the same thing. What do you think a fair price for a refurbished PS4 or Xbox would be?
---
#BY THE POPE! WHAT KIND OF HERESY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
---
Thats in the dreamin city, its the statue cats while that one just looks like Garfield
---
That's very true! I'll definitely look into that
---
Truth. Sadly, I have no friends! I've deposited 100 without losing any a few times, but can't seem to get the win.
---
Now that's a thought. I would imagine that a used 360 or ps3 would be considerably cheaper than a used xbox one or ps4. Thanks for the idea!
---
Nice , your Loadout?
---
Finished Luna's quest yesterday! üòé Now a little more than one reset left to claim Redrix's.
---
Did SOTP Like a diamond today, first try, was way easier that Petra's. Now I need to do the mind numbing grind for the kills and frames :/

Yes, let's recycle yet another D1 handcannon...

---
Yes, yes I am
---
grinded out luna howl quest steps today and had 2 games where I joined into a 2 vs 4, and ontop of that the 4 players were a 4 stack too. 
---
The games at 1800-2600 rank (haven't been higher yet) are horribly unbalanced too, always a one sided stomp. PVP in this game seems to be a hot mess with all the super/shotgun/lmg spam add ontop of that poor matchmaking. Very fun experience, would recommend.
---
Congrats on Luna's! I, too, just finished my Luna's yesterday!!

Someone‚Äôs a bit excited for the Konosuba movie I see

OOOHHHH MY GAAAAAWD
---
Valus copypasta. Ding edits just arent that funny imo.
---
Ah I see you‚Äôre a man of culture as well, I use the exact same loadout!
---
‚ÄúYour a liar and a cheat. Stay out of my crucible.‚Äù
---
Sadly if they gonna add really good designs back it won't be nice.
---
The game is in his last year and they're not gonna put more than 1-2 gpod desgins in (if they want to do it).
---
And if they gonna add 1 or 2, everyone woll put them on and everyone will look the same.
---
Never played the first game and but I can tell you this game's PvP is less fun than cancer.
---
Don't worry. Lots of people would buy it and support them even if is tied to silver only.
---
If they would put srmors like this in Eververse as Silver only, that would be my momment to delete the game and move on.
---
Her real name is "Jean".
---
Somebody at Mojang, I forget if it was Notch or Jeb, confirmed that.
---
That's right, they don't
---
A buddy and I were actually discussing this the other day if they brought it back it would keep the tradition of making the first gun you get go from underpowered to exotic and we said it should be like the khvostov and it‚Äôs perk is where you can change the way it fires (semi auto, fully auto, and 3 shot burst)
---
Hah, I call it my bang or bust load out. Mostly cause green can be hard to find at times. These three work together so well on contained maps tho. Really kicks a knuckle dragging shotgunner in the teeth.
---
I find that kind of dumb. I would have hope that they would provide people with the option to do another invitation if they felt like it (maybe have to go through an extra step to attain it, like a quest?).
---
Yup me too
---
Yes, but all it gives you is that you never get another damned small gift taking up a useless slot anymore.
---
Ok, I wish that was the case.
---
The only legendary worth it‚Äôs weight is No Turning Back and it‚Äôs set roll is just ok unfortunately
---
Not sure why you got so many down votes. I was wondering the same things.
---
I guess it's a good thing I'm starting to get better at my invades.
---
I'm around 75% done with the banking and winning step.
---
its lvl 30 tho
---
Don't they'll bring it at the final cycles of the games life like the first game,üòí for some reason

Agreed. I got one with archers tempo and hipfire grip and i put an Icarus grip on it. I can either go super speed flying lock or jumpy boy Hunter and i still won't miss a shot. Well as long as my aim is decent....
---
So awesome. The music just gets better for this franchise.

Also, you should have photoshopped your Guardian's helmet on top of yourself.

People have been asking for this for 3 years.

Get in line, guy

Yeah a metaphorical line would definitely be in place for this type of thing
---
Ahh yes, the same roll I've had since the start of Forsaken. She is a glorious creature.

I didn't play any Crucible in D1, considering I barely played D1 at all, but there's no way this isn't currently the worst point in Crucible.
---
Very creative, every upvote is well deserved.
---
"just flinch it" if that was the case it wouldn't be a top tier weapon in the first place it kills so fast you can't deal with it unless you get some range from it. So about jotunn I should just run away from it that's it? And tbh hardcliff like you say it's all about them getting heavy, but it's not about getting killed ofc in a 1v1 or even 2v1 against someone with heavy I wouldn't expect to win most of the times, it's about killing half of the team or getting killed from a gun fight in which you're not even in. I still think you can do well in crucible don't get me wrong it's just that using the same weapons over and over to do well/average or pick up some other good weapon outside the meta and having to go hard at it? If I wanted that I'd go to competitive
---
Was it worth it? I've been off and on.
---
cool bow, amigow
---
I‚Äôve been enjoying it. It‚Äôs nice to have a kinetic GL that detonates on impact
---
Try solo queuing? If found that some of the 4 stacks I get paired with aren‚Äôt actually that good
---
Lol nice try, you're pathetic attempt to get rid of me won't bring back that retard of a exo.

Why not? I couldn‚Äôt break 1000 points for a few days and look where I am now never give up!

Anyone who played Y1 D1 PvP is laughing at the stupid words that came out of your mouth.

If they were trash then sure they probably would

I think you mean shadow shot. Also,  *tether.

Oh! Got one of those, as well! Comes with a boom, and then an extra boom!

Amazing!

What‚Äôs the mod you got on that one? Never seen that one before!

Complaining about the Hunter having a good is like saying. 
---
Hunter - another Hunter with two feet? Really? I guess he can walk.
---
I can definitely relate ! Now I've hit 700 though, I'm starting to look saucy
---
all im gonna say is way of the wraith.  
---
and reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Looks more like an anvil than a plane.
---
By that logic games like Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro, World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Hollow Knight, Ori and the Blind Forest and others are garbage in terms of story and characters because it is not the campaign that is responsible for world building and character development but external sources.

I miss the red death VS thorn battles

Tbh aqua can atleast revive you

Ah ok, I though it was just a simple design mistake from bungie
---
That was. Funny
---
I would have liked the heroic unlocked to start farming the catalyst rather than needing to do the normal one again.
---
I believe it is. I don‚Äôt think she is meant to be ankle deep in the concrete. Just that I have never seem her fully out of the floor and honestly it irks me a little.
---
If they implement this, they will then make telemety useful after everyone has used em up.
---
You could make real friends and then you dont have to worry about randoms ruining your fun.
---
Oh fuck off D1 crucible was a shit show every year
---
This happened to me as well, it‚Äôs a bug, sorry OP but I guess the only thing u can do is do it over, but if this helps, the quickest way to do weapon bounties is to go to dreaming city LS (preferably Aphelions rest) and do the quest there, when I was grinding for the ship, every 15 mins I‚Äôd get a weapon completed
---
Thanks for the advice. I'm using Titan, I have a warlock but my problem is that I don't have any small adds to kill in the second phase of that room. Just 3 Shielded dudes who need multiple throws before I can damage them + no cover to give me to time to heal. I guess I'll try on my lock and not kill the adds as they spawn in
---
They are not open they require skull to be able to taket advantage of the perk
---
I miss actually having fun in the crucible. You could use the shittiest weapon and still get kills in D1. Where's the Ill Will gang?
---
That's gonna result in so many more drunk sex children.
---
Yeah constant resources such as, one balance patch every three months, like six weapons, a single armor set per class. And the big one, Two whole maps sometimes.
---
You must have a minimum of skill to use them, they're to easy to use
---
I'm at Heroic III rn.
---
Some of you gaurdians are alright, dont come to the tower tomorrow
---
I didn't play Trials much back then so I never had a Messenger, but I *did* get lucky with a Hopscotch Pilgrim. I re-rolled that bad boy until I ran out of motes more than once. Never got a god roll, ended up settling for counter balance and GHF. For about 3 or 4 weeks I felt like a god in crucible (before the nerf) and I am by no means a good pvp player. Shit was definitely out of whack back then too, but yeah it's so bad now that I only play Iron Banner weeks.
---
But let me guess, now it's balanced?
---
But is it what he would have done?
---
Lmao he made a don‚Äôt come to school tomorrow joke and his friend snitched

It appears you are asking a question about LFG/Clans, or help in-game.

---
It looks like my cat that‚Äôs been missing for two weeks... Maybe this is where she went.
---
The tracking is bullshit , I can agree on that to comprise it should instead be a cone type tracking where only enemies in front can get hit. Pulse should get some more random spread so it‚Äôs not a line of bullets.fusions already have a drawback with their charge time so a shotgun treatments shouldn‚Äôt be used on them. True sight isn‚Äôt as much of a problem it‚Äôs on the wishender ffs.

Same here! Just need Jotunn and Anarchy to finish my exotic collection

Haha this was awesome man! Started playing in february and just got my TC catalyst, just need to get a new computer so I can play MP and try this bad boy out for real!
---
I have the physical version they released. It‚Äôs sitting by my PS4 controllers next to Sundance.
---
He said they're annoying. I don't see anything implying that they're low skill weapons, because they're not. I don't even have the damn things and it's obvious.
---
When people complain about these guns, it's not because they think they're low-skill weapons. It's because they're annoying about getting stomped in Quickplay.
---

Im getting Sundance today

Lol

Actually doesn‚Äôt sound bad, aside from this though I‚Äôm don‚Äôt think mayhem would be good for the nade launcher kills
---
So I'll end up with 2 Titans?
---
Then why should lock achievements and loot behind other activities? I want 1k Voices, i should be able to farm public events for it to drop. I also want the Blacksmith title, I should be able to Gambit for it.

This content is not relevant to Destiny 2.

My man.

Oh. Her. Whaddya bet Nathan Fillon recommended her. She was on Castle for an episode, did VA work for C&amp;C:RA3, and /that/ movie.
---
Her lines struck me as poorly written and directed. Her delivery seemed like someone told her "young, teasing, confident".
---
It's still not as bad as Dinky and his mechanical delivery. Which I'll bet they also directed.
---
I assume you chose Team Drifter then? *\*Looks at you in disgust*
---
Excuse me, How many fucking kills?
---
It should be pretty obvious if someone on PC doesnt deserve their Not Forgotten. They would have it out at the wrong times, miss all of their shots, be out of position all the time, stuff like that. If I play against the same person over and over and see them have like a .20 efficiency every game when he is running Dust Rock and NF there must be something wrong. This just sounds like a salty comment. You sound like you've played with people using NF who just want to kill. Killing wins games. You dont need to capture flags in Control as long as your teammates can to win the game. If you can run in and open up a flag for your teammates, they can cap while you move to the next objective to try and slay out. True Vanguard has a whole video on it. If you think the dude getting 40 Defeats at the top of your team isn't doing a fantastic job at playing the objective in spite of his 1 or 0 captures then you're not realizing how the player is playing his role.
---
Mayhem is perfect for it. I was at 33 on double and calculated trajectory and i got all the way to 90 double and finished my calculated trajectory in  like 10 hours
---
I feel that stupidity in my soul... Because I just did the same.
---
Is it me or does that Uriels gift look really massive?
---
None of them... they just make y1 more relevant
---
Travelers chosen, Uriel‚Äôs gift and good bone structure. üëåüèª
---
It's the game mode that finally got me to mountaintop actually lol
---
As a Titan who did that, we've got absolutely nothing. I used Telesto to delete ads as soon as they spawned, and then just hoped to god that the bosses were stupid enough to walk in a line towards me. Played a game of catch until all their shields were down, then I whittled their health down slowly. Rinse and repeat one more time, and you should be fine. Rest of the strike is pretty easy.
---
No, just Trespasser.
---
At least we‚Äôve got arbalest to look forward to, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be that hard to get
---
Nah, but pair that with helm of Saint-14 and you‚Äôre golden
---
Damn, y‚Äôall got decimated by two invaders
---
‚ÄúIm gonna take my ghost to the gambit mode
---
I‚Äôm gonna diiiiie til I can‚Äôt bank motes‚Äù
---
Damn that shit has so many possibilities
---
Maybe in Year3?
---
Same haha. I‚Äôd rather get curated rolls so I can dismantle them for cores tbh.
---
Countdown is garbage!
---
Gotta use this meme whenever possible
---
I'm gana take my sparrow to the tangled shore. Tangled shore is like a wild west area so I thought it fit the best
---
You can but they are on a time limit once they drop. I'll try it anyway, any little bit helps, thanks
---
They could add it as an exotic, and call it "The good old days". It could say for the nostalgic ghosts.
---
Le Monarque and a god rolled Parcel? Heck yeah
---
My 1st hate mail came from mayhem I got accused of cheating because I was running tether and graviton Lance. I couldn't believe it, I'm not even that great I'd say average.
---
Oh dear.
---
Lol trying to feel important?  Yikes.
---
&gt;Would be nice if Bungie would give us more Vault Space for each new season. Doesn't even need to be much. Maybe 1 new page for each season, like Diabolo 3 does?
---
About that would be nice.
---
I have some weapons saved like weapons from calus (love the auto rifle and smg btw) but I still use them to this day, maybe not in crucible or raids but still, strikes and other pve stuff I'm always happy to use them.
---
Guess she's gettin preggers ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Massacre Medals - 12 kills in rapid succession with no more than 3 seconds between each kill.
---
I recommend using Riskrunner + Pulse Grenade (to self proc.) and I ran Synthoceps + lower tree Striker spamming the shoulder during super)
---
They can be difficult to obtain.
---
It def could use some love that‚Äôs for sure
---
Warlocks have to use their abilities? They can‚Äôt just sprint and become tanky af? That‚Äôs weird.
---
Oh, you mean the exotic that got nerfed into the ground? And the one you have to get melee‚Äôd first to use? Often by a shoulder charge? 
---
You‚Äôre a joke.
---
All of comp/pvp could use so love but I think this one is an easy fix hopefully.
---
That's cool, the arms are a little puffy looking Idk. Other than that I like.
---
It's not in the actual rules though. Maybe look at amending them.
---
Borderlands has vehicles, but with guns, and Destiny has the shield system, but with different armor
---
I'm on xbox too
---
any tips for me? I was a Titan in D1 so got him on this one again
---
Perfect man you can also send me a message and I‚Äôll add you GT WherezUrSkill, mostly a pvp player but have done a few raids
---
While its true supers can basically be free rounds i think the issue is super mods and certain supers that last way too long. Managing supers and shutting then down is a vital part of comp plus giving teams at least a chance to get some momentum going isnt terrible.
---
Bungie just did a huge stepback with the D2 armor especially Raid armor...Compared to the Age of Triumph armor it just looks so boring...
---
I like the idea as long as it's more than just "look i got the curated roll" or "I got the perfect roll" and more like "look i got 100k kills ok my gun" or "here is my setup"
---
Some folks have been trying to match with a clan mate or friend to do the nightfall challenge, coulda been that?
---
My wife just started to ask to take turns on matches with me since she wants to learn in the first week I‚Äôd play the first and she would play the second and from there we would swap back and forth and we would get tons of message about how ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trash‚Äù or to get off gambit. It would make her so upset she wouldn‚Äôt want to play anymore so I‚Äôd only hope they would be in my next match so I could make them hate their lives!    ( got me a few 22 guardian kills on gambit) Don‚Äôt hate people even if they are bad we all started somewhere!
---
I have a theory that he'll be back for destiny 3. At the end of the Ace of spade quest. He tells u to throw away all the files from cayde 1-5, meaning they'll figure out a way to bring him back as cayde 7. Just my theory lolz
---
Why do I feel like people that complain about dust rocks Luna's meta, don't have a good dust rocks or a Luna's and main a blast furnace and Jotunn üòÇ
---
I got Wavesplitter after a Crucible match and used it for a couple rounds before using it to infuse something else I probably ended up scrapping.  I just want the Cerberus!!
---
Agreed and sounds like your wife and you have a good time regardless. GG  to both of you.
---
I remember using loudout and still being viable, supers were killable, maps were tactical, most importantly there was variety, I remember me and my friend checking our crucible skill through the d1 tracker both being top 3% of players according to k/d and overall performance, i think now im bottom 3% ‚Ñí‚Ñ¥‚Ñì
---
I don't know why, but I absolutely hate prime. I like regular gambit. Maybe it's because the difference between good and bad teams are more pronounced in Prime due to all the damn invasions...

Or are you advocating that "it was just a joke" is a perfect defense to any crime? How do you feel about people who get arrested for trying to scam people by selling fake drugs? How about people getting charged for swatting people? "It wasn't real heroin! It was just a joke, man! I was only joking about putting a date rape drug in her drink!"
---
You're way out of your depth here. There are literally centuries of case precedents that disagree with you.

Using aim assist mod aswell? For me the best sniper is the black armory one (forgot the name). It just feels right for me
---
This is probably what I wanted to hear :)
---
I never said it was

2) Don't get close to the stompy boys  
---
3) Kill the stompy boys  
---
4) Kill the snipers
---
O.O
---
Holy shit
---
Because if I nuke one knight with the teather up I kill all 3. Sure I gotta use my weapon instead but it goes real fast and keeps the ads off of my back
---
Fantastic
---
In y3 there has to be armor that does something like that
---
My new main gun is my latest Kindled Orchid 
---
Corkscrew Rifling
---
Accurized Rounds
---
Surrounded + Surrounded Spec
---
Rampage
---
Stability MW
---
Paired it with some Enhanced HC loader gloves and it‚Äôs my new favorite gun for PVE. Easily replaced Midnight Coup for my main hand cannon. Perfectly pairs with my curated Threat Level.
---
And I honestly don't think that's a bad thing. Let Destiny PvP be its own thing. It's what I like about it. Every few months something new is broken to play with.
---
If you want true balanced PvP go play Quake or something idk. Destiny isn't and should be never be that
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure hive are genderless correct me if I‚Äôm wrong
---
Same!! People are such assholes
---
Orrrrrr we could revive him with Rasputin and know with the awaken traveler to create another ghost so he can help us to fight for the vanguard towards the drifter
---
I would kill for some hive armor
---
I have run into 1 kill clip/rampage kindled orchid in the entire time that I‚Äôve played pvp, and as frustrating as it is getting 2 tapped by that, it‚Äôs not being used by everybody and their mother every game, it‚Äôs once in a blue moon
---
If you think 130 damage on a shot isn‚Äôt an auto win button then idk what to tell you. It‚Äôs literally 2 shots from your gun in one
---
2 hc shots
---
2 pulse bursts 
---
Etc
---
If I could do 130 damage with a single pulse burst and I lost the gunfight, imo I am as dogshit as they come, and don‚Äôt deserve to have the gun that does that
---
Please drop your gamer tag so or pm me so we can be friends! (Also I‚Äôm a super helpful clan and most wouldn‚Äôt mind giving you pointers for pvp!!)
---
I use a very wide array of weapons and compete with meta just fine. I have an eystein-D I like to use sometimes as well as an age old bond. It's all about playing to your guns advantages. For example, sure my Eystein wont have the godly ttk like lunas or not forgotten, but why would I be challenging them at their intended ranges anyways when I could be holding a long lane and doing full damage. To make up for the mediocre mid range game you can use a good bone structure or something to have more range then a buckshot shotgun. Now compared to D1, I have a big problem with sticky nades in general. They ALL one shot when stuck to another guardian which is annoying and almost makes any other grenade obsolete. How many grenades are truly obsolete in D2? Maybe flux compared to the other arc grenades, but that's pretty much it. They all have their uses. Also in D1, snipers had way too much aim assist to make them way too easy to use which lead to them being used by pretty much everyone. In D2, the people that can aim well can snipe still and the people that cant will typically not do well with them. Sucks for them, but it's a weapon type that can 1 shot kill from any position on the map with a headshot, it should actually be a skill based weapon. Titans were the clear choice to be the best in crucible in D1, at least the way I see things. First of all, Titan skating. Titan skating was the indisputable fastest way of getting around in D1, no other class even came close. Titans also have access to fusion grenades, stickies, as well as good supers on all classes. Yes, that includes the bubble. It ups everyone's neutral game significantly just by stepping in it. Dont get me wrong, I like D1, but I wont sit here and say that it is more balanced than D2. Up for discussion, if you have valid points.

TL;DR: D1 is super unbalanced and D2 is balanced, feel free to try to change my mind

At least I can escape into cover if it's a Hammerhead. Wardcliff Coil just kills me no matter what I do

It‚Äôs a curse for using spectral in comp

My friend and I got our Thorn last night. Mine was 665 Light.

Thank you for the tips. See you starside.

Thank you and to you as well.

There was a cutscenes a while back that you got, iirc, from doing the Offering in the Dreaming City for that week. It showed a Ghost flying around and finally resurrecting someone under a sheet, who quickly sits up and is revealed to be Uldren. 
---
Outside of that cutscenes (that was only available for like a week) nothing else has been said about it.
---
When you visit Mara Sov's throne on the left there is a display that normally shows Darkness ships. One week it showed a building. When you inspected it it showed Pulled Pork scanning a body under a flag. 
---
Pulled Pork rezzed the body, the flag falls away and we see it was Uldran Sov. As far as I know there hasn't been anything else in game to hint at him being a Light Bearer now. 
---
I'm also ok with Uldran being the new Hunter Vanguard. I feel Cayde-6 would have wanted it this way and would have laughed about it for days.
