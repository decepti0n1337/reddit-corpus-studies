Would've been a really cool clip without the bagging.
---
This is why I’m here. Nice
---
Yeah I’ve seen multiple posts where it’s like “it’ll cost you over 100,000 bright dust to get every eververse item” and I’m like ok, does anyone even really want or need every single item though?
---
NIce.  I love that.  I love you even more.  If i could I would give you hugs everyday when you wake up from sleep and leave you with a cup of spring water.
---
Wow. Good attitude Bungie! It still hurts my brain that someone can say the game is dead unironically, but I guess whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars.
---
They fixed it.
---
hopefully never, because his character depth is lackluster and is only brought out for comedic relief sorry WAS only brought out for comedic relief
---
Honestly with the right shader it’ll look great. It’s the baby blue that sucks.
---
Is this real?
---
the wife bad am i rite gamers
---
Depends on what mode you use it for. For PVP it’s only a one shot to the head or if they’re damaged already. For PVE I can’t really say
---
Masterworking armor is like upgrading your cell phone.
---
Thank you :)
---
My eyes are up here, guardian
---
This is some Looney Tunes shit right here.
---
I’ve only been in the QP playlist. How bad is comp rn?
---
Such a big boy dude.
---
Well the issue was it would appear and flash as if there was a reason to go check it. If I recall correctly.
---
Ill find out friday
---
That's sick, I'm a hunter so I can relate, lol
---
"one"
---
Damn, really? I was going to do the sidearm first..maybe if a buff comes around it'll be more worth it?
---
1:no
---

---
2: the game will scale to his level and you'll do at most 50 more levels than the enemies if you are too high
---
4: yes. He'll get loot at his level
---
Yea hopely the exotic  side arm is good
---
I love giant robots. Is that on XBONE?
---
It was more of “This is boring so why would I do this instead of something else” kind of thing for me
---
I just did Bergussia forge for the Black Armory weekly and lost sectors on the moon for Eris' weekly. That got me most of the way there.
---
I'm stupid.  Thanks.
---
Haha yeah, I actually used that too for exactly the same build, it was insane
---
Yeah it did sacrifice itself to give us a chance to help us destroy the darkness to carry on the light and to protect us from anything that would see us wiped from existence because it knew that the majority of us could successful y weild the light and to not be corrupted from it's power and look what happens to races that do they become corrupt like the cabal insane like the vex or hive or obsessed like the fallen it left those races because it found them unworthy to weild it's power and just an FYI nothing of what you said proves the darkness is good it only means that the traveler isn't some benevolent dirty and your right but between a force that at least has some sort of care for life vs a force that worships death and destruction I choose the former
---
Looks like every other titan, what are we supposed to be seeing?
---
Yes
---
this from the same guy who wants me to drop his ass a goodbye letter if/when I peace out of system?
---
I'm getting mixed signals here, Drifter.
---
it's better this way
---
He told me to get these 5 toed things and I don't even have room for cheese!
---
The couple of videos I've seen make it seem like a fun exotic. Not game breaking by any means, but a fun change from the meta.
---
Full Auto is a top tier perk but what do I know? I've only played this since beta. Try farming reckoning, strikes, and the two newest raids as they all either have high impact shotguns or are able to drop a one-two punch shotty. Keep in mind full auto increases RoF slightly which gives it an edge over non trench barrel/one-two punch shotguns
---
Sigh... come on how can you post on reddit a question that people are literally making videos about on YouTube. You gotta put some effort in like atleast try, the mods power you up allowing you to either beat enemies that require a certain mod to beat their shield... being new doesn’t mean you get to be lazy
---
I think they’ll be situational, but if you’re getting thirsted and roll behind a corner you’ll leave a nice surprise for an ape
---
Sums up pretty much anything you look at too. I wake up every morning like this
---
It's not hard to understand, but I'm beginning to feel like you may underappreciate the art of disappearing from sight both fashionably and not properly. It's the thought that counts, and this thought would be the truly unexpected, a ridiculous thought, a highly entertaining thought for not only yourself but all onlookers too.
---
Also, the build includes the powerful One Two Punch Shotgun and Melee Exotic combo, the invisibility of Ratking really is indeed just a luxurious afterthought, luxurious enough for everyone to be transfixed by it, so that they may think to themselves "is he for real?". Which, if you ask me, is all the attention one could ever ask for. You are one for function over flair. I would not expect you to understand.
---
r/murderedbywords
---
Could be fun in pvp , but in pve thats a waste of exotic slot
---
Ima guess it’s eververse
---
Why do I want this so bad?
---
"For Ghosts that want to be Mark 85"
---
I think a little Ether just came out of me
---
This is a repost from r/raidsecrets
---
I can do you one better, I as a f2p player never even set foot on the moon, let alone did a vex offensive at all
---
Not once did I ever play a vex offensive lol
---
Lol you're probably right
---
Trials*
---
I think you have to go to Osiris to get a mission to open the obelisk. If he doesn't have anything, back out and talk to him again. If not, I would recommend just going to the obelisk and seeing if it will let you activate it.
---
No 10% xp no use.
---
I feel the same about the handcannon reload mod. It made using handcannons without outlaw or rapid hit tolerable.
---
Because part of the patch notes said year one weapons got a makeover and were returning to the loot pool.
---
I have a shell that tracks crucible kills it's so awesome, anyway I don't use it because no guiding light.
---
*Some.
---
Oh man don’t even get me started, it’s unbelievable
---
If you’ve ever used 18 kelvins, which is my favorite sidearm, it feels like that but better
---
Oh lol thanks
---
They are
---
Nope
---
Dead game but it’s community raised how much money for charity?
---
The man who killed Cayde will replace Cayde in the tower lmao
---
there’s an exotic sparrow named “Otherside” and can be found rarely from Vanguard strike chests
---
Your new light friend should be paying attention, one invade is enough to tell him why.
---
New finisher for warlocks uses dawnblade.
---
What's guiding light??
---
I hope they get out the defibrillator and bring the Breakneck back to live eventually. They murdered that thing so hard.
---
It’s at about 1.5 million daily players right now and has been since the announcement of ShadowKeep. 100k a day is an active game. Destiny is doing fantastic right now
---
And it's not for space rhinos
---
They called me the very best, like no one ever was.
---
Yes, but once you get it you can get them from the collection tab
---
What do i do when i talk to him?
---
Reminds me of a lighter themed metal knight from smash bros for some reason
---
That's always been a console feature
---
It boosts your xp. 
---
So kind of pay to win
---
Some juicy stuff right there
---
Osiris, you’ve made a big f*cky wucky
---
ye
---
I finally got the smg after a few runs yesterday. It was the last one I needed.
---
I mean, if I could post pictures of these things I would, that would make this a lot easier for me.
---
But 
---
For a hint at the scope and depth of controller options commonly found in other console shooters, Battlefield 5 on Xbox, has within it's controller options on Xbox, *2 PAGES* of nothing but sensitivity options. 
---
just. sensitivity. options. alone.
---
I'm not really asking for much here, not some BF5 level customization, just some really basic, standard functionality that's common in shiiters contemporary to Destiny 2.
---
I am a kinderguardian , so can someone could be kind enough to explain me who saint-14 is ? Thanks in advance
---
I bet one of the Gambit shaders makes the resemblance even stronger.
---
That's my excuse for Jotun in Crucible. Hell, I've been killed more by Arbalests this week than ever before. And it one shots, so I feel like I have to use Jotun or my own Arbalest to just not get stomped.
---
Salty af to downvote without replying. Bye Felicia
---
Most people rejected his message. They hated u/Zombifikation for he spoke the truth
---
Because Cayde is coming back bitches!!!
---
I hope
---
While I personally somewhat enjoy D2, I know a guy who is a D1 veteran and does not like D2 for the reasons stated above. Take them with a grain of salt, but there is some truth to them.
---
Saint 7
---
r/destinycirclejerk
---
Is his picture in the ramen shop still there?
---
Yes because it’s a past season bright engram shader so now you can only get it from an Eververse engram
---
I'm not really asking for much here, not some BF5 level customization, just some really basic, standard functionality that's common in shooters contemporary to Destiny 2.
---
Which shotty?
---
What HAPPENED to arbalest
---
You can see (visually) the entire list of Silver only and those that will at some stage be avail for dust here - https://www.todayindestiny.com/eververse
---
It should be your inventory, you can refund it within 30 days (I think) as long as you don’t unlock it.
---
Gambit  one
---
Well that’s something I never imagined I’d hear
---
Ok bet
---
At this point they’re just babysitting the lower skilled players and completely forsaking the skilled players by tanking the lethality of not forgotten which is a weapon that some can only dream of. I feel that the idea that things that are difficult to get should be the best has been completely thrown out the window
---
Aww, such a cool ship, too.
---
You can get it from the fond memory engrams, so eververse. Unless it a also available in the story but then idk why it would be in the engram
---
That was beautiful :’)
---
Same here, out of three strikes I got both
---
I agree with you and the amount of downvotes that you have, show how blind most of Bungie consumers are and how strong is the fan club.
---
Bungie has failed to deliver factions back to the game, has failed to deliver solution to Trials, has failed to support PvP community on basic subjects and like always,  Eververse is bright shinning with every kind of nice loot that they removed from activities and protected behind the paywall. Not to mention the abusive prices...
---
I love destiny, I’ve been playing non-stop since D1 release on September 2014 and I can easily say that Destiny has become bigger than Bungie.
---
Much disappoint, it didn’t work. And now I’m down a ship.
---
I stopped playing back in October and was like... bish what??
---
Is being casual an issue?
---
"Fortnite bad Destiny good"
---
That game certainly started out casual and it'd be hard pressed to call it dead aside from when they took their own servers offline, much like Bungie does.
---
The quest is unavailable for me, do you know of any requirements beyond owning dlc and such?
---
Make Osiris proud
---
Same. I got good at gambit grinding for breakneck, but got burned out in it after that. When I went back to finish my infamy resets for Dredgen, I realized how much fun I'd been having doing it.
---
i mean, you can, we now have infinit timelines, so I bet there is a timeline where im still throwing knives :D
---
Dude, its just a sniper with a charge. Everyone was pissing and moaning about the temporary sniper meta for revoker, get over it.
---
Ok, thats a problem
---
Unfortunately true of most games with expansions. Completely agree with you though
---
You relize that’s playing the game right
---
#IS THERE ANY TITLE THAT DOESN’T REQUIRE ME TO SELL MY SOUL
---
Ah well, at least I can reacquire it.
---
The five of swordsnl only applies to the non-ordeal version of the nightfall strike option.
---
It's been in the game for nearly a year now, if it were broken we'd have noticed already
---
Taken King in D1 was barely known, a year without content, and the April Update was a joke compared to what was shown. Sure it was a great DLC but after the first few months it was the worst content drought the game has ever had
---
Redrix's looks cool and I'd love to have it, but I hear the perks got gutted recently? Is it still worth getting, even just to use in PvE?
---
I really dislike the look of Veist weapons...
---
Wut...
---
And I know I can't use both
---
I understand that it’s good that more players are playing the game because of it, but I think that new light completely ruined the PvP experience for veterans
---
I hear savior is easier to get than undying.
---
Can you remind me what that one entails, as I am currently writing.
---
what do you get on your sparrow instead of instant summon then?
---
thank you, once you get the hang of it it's pretty easy, but something like this wont happen every game, they just lined up perfectly. Im happy if I get a crispy double knive kill, this was just insane and probably won't happen again anytime soon.
---
map is awesome, feels good to be back :)
---
Yes because you really earned that kill Mr OeM striker titan floating into the air and then one shotting me with mountaintop.
---
Sometimes weapons work really well. They aren’t without skill or time to acquire. Guardians can take the path to let go of the little things, or dwell and stay sour. Do you want to be a sour Guardian?
---
Make group for nightfall ordeal legend difficulty (950) it's usually the best way to achieve 100k
---
Switch to strafe jump
---
The description of Universal Armor Ornaments say that you need to have year 3 or 2 armor on to use that ornament
---
Indeed
---
I’ve been playing since 1 and half the time I don’t get the callbacks I’m just this idiot stumbling through each new adventure and I love it
---
You have to use 3rd party app to manage weapons. It was like this forever, but its ok to live with that.
---
Just when activity starting you can port new items (for NF u do that before starting).
---
And even during activities you can do that
---
..."If". *Before* they fire their first shot.
---
Playing Russian Roulette, there...
---
\*Highway to the Dangerzone intensifies\*
---
I wish Destiny didn't go all out space magic. It turned from a sci-fi dystopian space travel fantasy to a space-based supernatural fantasy with ridiculous lore and space witchcraft with a little bit of guns and space travel sprinkled on top.
---
how do i go about getting my gaurdian on pc?
---
Well i am actually kinda mature for my age. Also, i didnt even use the artifact mods. Also, he is definitely referring to the new fun Symetrry
---
You have to purchase it on every platform vanilla till warmind is f2p .everything else has to be paid for on each platform except the season passes they are account wide
---
Paul Ganus? Abunch of skyrim characters like the city guards
---
I used the companion app and it has the option to setup cross save. Or I think it’s on bungos website
---
no i got one, you can see it it's there
---
The 100k pinnacle gear comes from the ordeal. The five of swords applies to the old nightfalls on the far right. Those are basically for farming strike specific weapons.
---
Yeah that’s what I’ve been doing. I guess I got to keep on doing it.
---
these are the times where i wish crucible had a "kill cam"
---
Oh I see.
---
This would be so good with Alchemist Raiment /s
---
do the void and arc shell do this too?
---
No. They specifically state you must own content on both platforms to play it
---
I love the buzzard! never liked sidearms till today.
---
Where do they state that?
---
Nope, it got absolutely shit on. When the fire rate ramps up to a rapid-fire its impact is lowered to that of a rapid-fire. It’s like running a rapid-fire pulse that only has outlaw.
---
Hunters on a whole new level in pvp now
---
that looks cool I wanna do it
---
This is from a hunter who runs bottom tree for the longest time.
---
Its kind of busted. yes. What really suprised me is how the wind up actually kind of helps with the aiming, as you do have that extra second to aim your knife.
---
Alright, I was afraid that was the case. Obviously I haven't done enough research haha. Thanks much!
---
I just want it, I just need it! To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive!!

What roll did you have on your last man standing? I have the curated(plus a couple of other rolls, but using the curated indefinitely) but I think I want more from it.
---
What mods are those?
---
Yes, Lord of Wolves.
---
I'd help if i could (haven't touched my pc in months)
---
Shit... I don't know either of them. I just got the Invitation quest. I haven't bought Forsaken, yet. Is that why I don't get XP or have any arms &amp; armaments buying options from Spider on Tangled Shore???
---
Is the ikelos still good? I havent played destiny in a while
---
Oh I didn't know.. Sorry
---
Mate I know he's referring to symmetry, but he's referring to not JUST symmetry, but Randy's and other rapid fires
---
“Go get it then.”
---
That's what happened when mountain top was "the gun" itll go away after a month or so. But agreed its crappy
---
True
---
Resonant stems are broken too, so it’s probably a bug like other things.
---
I have to say this New Light update feels a lot like when I got into the game in Season 4, when they made the game free for like a month. Al though back then we got waaay more cosmetic rewards, I love playing with a fresh new community.
---
Except arbalest isn't tied to a tedious questline and dlc
---
I Snipe/HC and close chokeholds with barriers. And yeah, Shoulder charges are fun and strong, but we gotta get close. Kinda hard in the Shotgun/Sniper Meta, lol.
---
Hunters have safer escape options with great Supers and mobility. Mobility is king in FPS PvP. Not saying Titans AREN'T BS at times, but the majority of Hunters complain when another class tests their crown for top spot in PvP.
---
God edit
---
My loadout
---
  
---
Arbalest
---
Black Scorpion 
---
Crooked Fang
---
I got multi kill clip with field prep god roll of god rolls.
---
That sounds really good actually.
---
Yep still have the frame same as in the pic
---
The sound of it charging up haunts me in my dreams
---
Its not a crossbow, but at the moment no. The quest was a reward for owning the season pass, for now it’s been removed.
---
Yep, I had fun with the Sunbracers. The Solar grenades not only burn longer, but now you can kill something red from a huge distance with your "melee", and then you can spam out five giant burning suns and drop on/around them. Or spam out four, that leaves you with a full grenade you can aim a bit more deliberately.
---
God damn. You're such a great artist. Keep up the good work.
---
?
---
I was playing an elim private match with my gf and this came up after the match ended back in orbit. Has anyone seen this before???
---
Regular bow* my bad, and damn that’s a bummer, I just bought the season pass for season 9 and I’m at the step where you have to do the arms dealer strike but it says it’s for season 8 owners only :(
---
You know i personally love snorting a whole line of crayons and destroying perople with the apeage but i may neex to try this
---
same here. got it as a crucible drop from my first match.
---
I've yet to see someone with arbalest in crucible. I'm on Stadia though, so I don't know if that has anything to do with it.
---
Did you get one? If so where did you get it?
---
What's a blueberry...?
---
(I'm new)
---
Ok dope thank you.
---
It's because you didn't do the forsaken. (Yes i know that you probably did forsaken but in the new light they reset my red war story which i did so i believe you have to do it again.)
---
ngl I see a lot of titans saying “Omg I’m so much better than One-Eyed Mask, Synthocepts gang!” yet OEM is still the only exotic I see Titans use in crucible. All I saw last season, all i’m seeing this season.
---
Do linear fusion rifles 1 shot in the body?
---
The most annoying thing is when you play a team of Arbalest. Even if the first guy body shots you the second guy has you.
---
Also with the new ritual quest it’s the only way to progress more than like 2% each match
---
Exactly. I'm willing to bet that your issue. They should have included a tooltip about that if its intended cause theres nobway to know unless you happen to figure it out by yourself.
---
Nothing compared to first watch though
---
You could go on the bungie clan site, go through a few and just send requests to join, thats how i found my clan im in now for 2 years. Also you could post in r/fireteams for raids. You will probably find a team there too even if its your first run
---
True, I just hate sidearms so this was hell for me
---
Theres always a war with the cabal on Mars, all that matters, is whether you step in it or no- eww, did I just step in cabal? Damn it, these boots are new!
---
Im still trying to run crown to get the auto rifle, cant find groups
---
Yea exactly. There was no nerf, they just repaired it
---
Yeah I’m not a fan of them either
---
I can hear that sound in my head
---
Is there a way to complete Make Bows, Not War in Season 9? I wasn't able to finish it in Season of Undying (started late).
---
Trying to start the Arms Dealer strike says that I need season 8.
---
Openings shot probably
---
Could've sworn it was a solar. Well, there's lots of strong energy weapons, just pair Ratking with those, it'll be fun
---
Filthy casuals
---
True, the only thing that sets them apart is range and ease of use.
---
I feel like if you swapped your char to a Titan and made a video about throwing mini-hammers, it would get upvoted and a nerf would follow :')
---
damn it i knew someome would notice that
---
I don't. He shouldn't. If he did, his death would have no meaning, and the Forsaken expansion would have been pointless.
---
 *I bring gifts of the Nine. Gifts you sorely need.*
---
They're not talking about light level, dear.
---
The front shoulder buttons should be:
---
Left= grenade 
---
Right= arc melee/throwing knife/ smoke grenade
---
Double tapping the circle button (I believe) should activate a dodge going into the direction you are walking.
---
Those are the three boxes on the lower left.
---
If you press the pause button you can change your focus and check what you have equipped, read what the description says and decide what you think sounds good and equip it.
---
Lost sectors are marked with a specific symbol which will also show up on your map and you need to kill the sector boss to get a code.
---
Don't give up yet guardian!
---
But did you map someone?
---
\*chuckles in pre-Season of Dawn Arbalest user\*
---
but now that it's meta i'll have to switch to something else, actually.
---
She thanked me even though i didn't have the season pass . 
---
I also received the quest for leviathan's breath and obviously can't finish it 0-0
---
Anyways gonna help save Saint XIV now .
---
true, but the knive is the only real attractive abbility on this subclass its not like bottom striker was in the past where every ability was and the super itself where broken
---
Idk where the hanger or the tower is and the problem is when I look it up theres no videos that tell me how to get there just loads of videos about her character and some hidden terminal. This is my problem when looking anything up is I never just get a straight foward answer. I'm just going to delete it and go back to dark souls. stick with what you know, I guess
---
But you aren't buying anything...
---
Game is dead lemao
---
I agree bungie does a horrible job of explaining the game/lore/how shit works, its ridiculousness
---
I grinder mars heroic one, closest to Ana bray one. Took me 20 runs with Huckleberry on. Definitely worth it
---
It’s normal for your first run, just use heavy and supers and you’ll be fine. Afterwards you’ll get the seasonal artifice, where you can get anti-barrier, overload and unstoppable mods to deal with them in future
---
Plaque is still there for me. Picture in the ramen shop and Colonel still just fine, too. Might have been a temporary bug for ya.
---
While my run went alright, I did think about that when I saw that the raid had unstoppable and barrier champions. The only way you could get the overload and anti-barrier was by having the sundial which you got AFTER completing the quest. Anyone got the answer for this?
---
thank you, As an other hunter said the knive charge kind of helps with aiming
---
Bet you use skullfort and top tree striker.
---
Or maybe handheld supernova.
---
thank you :)
---
If youre interested in lore regarding cayde I would recommend checking out the grimoires telling the story of Andal Brask and the vanguard dare that led to cayde becoming the hunter Vanguard. It shows more of what he was like prior to being forced to stay in the tower.
---
Lost sectors are marked on the map, something like 2 half cricles  stacked on each other and a point at bottom. When you are in the area it is painted on the wall too. The actual entrance is kind of hidden, not obviously  visible at first, usually is some kind of crevice. You enter and after some  empty area there are a lots of mobs with an elite/boss. After you killed everything there is a cache (lost sector cache codes). There is an introduction quest for lost sector (from NPC Devrim Kay in EDZ, Trostland, in the temple ruin)
---
Bro, when you go to the big white ball on the  locations menu, you spawn on the tower.
---
When spawned, turn left and go down that obvious hallway, down some stairs, turn right and you can already see her marker
---
bro 😎💪
---
You're welcome to continue trying, but I'd be very surprised if that change was reverted.  Engrams have always been assigned loot on pick up in D2.
---
r/dogelore
---
Such a useless bot
---
You could try your luck farming exotics off of nightfalls.  But if you don't have it it'll be tricky because there are so few linear fusion rifles in the game. Luckily this season is a long one so you have time :)
---
I leaned the secret for me to enjoy destiny is too not go in crucible.
---
$50 for all that? Definitely worth
---
Eh, it's pretty good. Feel like they're pushing the bumblebee narrative a little too much
---
Oh no
---
I love the move but am I the only one that sucks at it????
---
I mean, would’ve looked better if the pic wasn’t deep fried
---
Is it a new thing to call them ritual weapons? Weren't they called pinnacle weapons? Or am I dumb ?(tho probably I am)
---
Just a quick exotic list
---
For arc, get either shinobi's vow or lucky raspberry if you like grenades, raiden flux if you're looking at super utility
---
For solar, shards for mid tree (super refunds), Ophidia Spathe for mid or bottom tree (knives for days)
---
For void, Orpheus Rig on top or bottom tree but if you're running bottom tree, you can use graviton forfeit instead for longer invis/de aggro, gwisins vest for mid tree super
---
Other than that i say the biggest improvement is the fighting scenes are greatly improved.
---
In addition to the other poster's great explanation, I should also add a bit about Saint's signature weapon, the Perfect Paradox shotgun and it's relation to our guardian.
---
Basically, due to all the timeline shenanigans, Saint-14 was not living through his time linearly. The first time we encounter the gun, he's already dead and we're taking it from his corpse. But Saint-14 himself got it in what he experienced as his past (which was actually our future) from the player character guardian. Thus, the shotgun's existence is a perfect paradox.
---
I played it once on the last day, and that was just to complete the weapon quests I had.
---
That could be a good bloodhound skin
---
Yes, no idea what it does.
---
Hunters can OHK with the knife. They also have the best class ability for pvp. All their supers are good in PvP(well, the tether not really) Now the new mods and exotic legs make them dangerous just because they use their clases ability.
---
Titans and Warlocks also have broken stuff, but don't act as if hunters had nothing
---
Think it lets us inspect players again
---
“…haters are the loudest” pretty much sums up the entirety of the Internet. Those (like me) who love this game are too busy feeding our addiction to complain. Yes, the game has issues. Not Anthem-level problems, of course, but there are things that could be better. That’s true of everything. I’ve been playing Destiny since day 1 of year 1 and still enjoy it.
---
The size of the fan base also adds to the negativity. The number of people playing means there are widely diverse types of players, who all want different things out of the game. No matter what Bungie does, there will always be some part of the community who won’t like it because it impacts their favored style of play and will complain.
---
Sites like Reddit, while useful, pull together the voices of those who complain. Misery loves company and all that. It helps to keep things in perspective: not even the majority of complainers speak for the majority of players.

It's to inspect I'm pretty sure

Tell him to give me Cerberus+1.

Eris is coo coo, her only solstice is arts and crafts. That and screwing around with the hive, but we don’t talk about that.
---
Thank you for all of that information! I have a hunter and titan class. No warlock yet. I just wanted to make sure if I bought the season pass the Symmetry and all the armor would be added to all the characters. Thanks!
---
Rapid fires are middle of the pack in terms of TTK either head or body.
---
If you consistently land heads I would recommend the adaptive bursts, otherwise go with the aggressive bursts.
---
Yeah there is a new dlc out bro so you definitely can
---
....shields blow up if they’re destroyed with a matching archetype, you dont need shield disorient for that
---
What's this from?
---
Oh god oh f**k oh god
---
I just noticed that those shoulde charge complains started with new light. Get used to it. You are tactical class not one that rushes on enemy face. Keep your distance. To do shoulder charge a need to be close to you. To kill you with a shotgun too. Just be away.
---
Holy shit what the fuck you character is having a stroke
---
Otherwise agree, except one part. Hunters explosive throwing knife is really strong. It can finish so many titans trying to recover their health behind a titan wall. Or stop the recovery and then push when they have a sliver of a health left. Also very good if you run out of ammo in the middle of a gunfight and your enemy is weak. 
---
Also love the hunter grenades, for example, tripmine. So good to setup traps and make damage behind walls.
---
Mate... huh. Run ?.
---
Bungo*
---
That’s awesome!
---
Dude. GG
---
The whole black armory thing is pretty old so many people probably already done it or have no interest in it and with the new season that just began you'll probably be hard pressed to find people since they're going around doing new stuff.
---
Do it
---
You clearly haven't stepped foot in the crucible this season.
---
And I replied to his comment, not your post as a whole.
---
Good to know, just felt the need to clarify
---
Very intriguing thank you. This could be useful
---
How do people get this many exotics. I've played for a 4 months and only one exotic engram has dropped for me. I have 3 exotics in total.
---
What I’m saying is I think, for a F2P game, this is fine. They need to make money somehow so I’d rather them take cosmetics away and overcharge than to start selling gameplay altering items like many F2P games do
---
Just got one line in the sand and decided to try it out against izanagis, and its precision damage is 38,040 while izanagi with catalyst is 168,036. I dont know if my perks are shit, and im lazy and dont want to test every mod combination, but for now i'll stick with izanagis and love and death and hope for some variety in "optimal" dps department

"Big guy with horns over there is Shaxx, he runs the crucible, and he's a bro."
---
"Crucible?"
---
"Oh, we all kill eachother for fun, don't think about it too hard"
---
"I, I uh, What?!?"
---
Its a bastard child between Skyburners and Queenbreaker. No aim required but now even with hip-fire
---
Very nice! Next up: bigass rocket launcher
---
you do them 
---
seriously though, think about joining a clan that does raids regularly. If you need one hmu you can always join mine
---
'81 kids represent
---
Yeah, it was just a random chance to spawn the overlord. I spawned it several times while killing no hydras, and it failed to spawn several times while killing all 15 hydras. They were just a distraction.
---
I thought this question was going to be “If we can bring Saint 14 back to life, can’t we bring Cayde back?”
---
It has to be from your melee ability
---
Nightfall the Ordeal gets easier for the not hardcore players
---
Lol
---
I'm not talking about it being "good or bad" in the first place, i'm simply stating that it's entirely viable, at least up to a certain point.
---
I am not a great example but I have like 10 raids done and the best thing I can say is go on the community to look for groups or get a couple of friends and the best thing to get better at them is to do a ton. Maybe start with some easier, ones like eater of worlds.
---
Hopefully not
---
FU*K
---
Practice, practice, and did I mention practice? I teach people raids here and there and I’ve noticed that it’s all fine and dandy to explain it or see a video, but people truly don’t know what’s going on until they experience it firsthand. Videos give a general gist of what to do, but actually running it through will teach you how it all actually goes down at a real time pace.

More like this guy is on his way to shoot up a school...

What? You want a picture of whats left of his foot? Manners are important everywhere my dude. My goal was never to get your approval, but an attempt to get a response from bungie if I make enough of a stink. Wouldn't even be on this website if bungie had a help line to call.

---
Yeah but this is more a personal beef for me
---
Again:
---
&gt; Eververse is bright shinning with every kind of nice loot that they removed from activities and protected behind the paywall. Not to mention the abusive prices... 
---
Is this statement true or false?  
---
Not asking or arguing with your point of view. I pointed out what is happening. 
---
At the same time that it is fine for, it can be shit for me and many others.
---
You said that my point on Eververse isn´t valid, which implies that it is a lie or is incorrect. So tell me, is the statement false or a lie?
---
I was playing in clash the whole time, its a team deathmatch mode
---
LoL.
---
What is the best mode to use this? And do copies of the mod stack?
---
Hey fuck off dude they're talkin about theres kids more then the game
---
Such extremely skilled players couldn’t imagine getting thwarted by such a lowly telesto?

Unfortunately you can't stack Armor 2.0 super generating mods with their Armor 1.0 equivalents, and stacking 2.0 mods have diminishing returns. Not sure by how much yet, still need to have a closer look at that
---
They patched the 2.0/1.0 stacking in patch 2.6.1, but before that you could actually stack enhanced ashes to asssets from 1.0 and 2.0 for double the effect. This sort of stacking was also insane with dynamo when it worked. You could already stack dynamo 2.0 for double effect, but you could also use dynamo on 1.0 leg armor, for a total of 3x the effect. Could get a full dawnblade super with four rifts with that (which you could spam by using Starfire Protocol, so in about 20/25 seconds iirc)
---
Watch a guide on youtube. Then run raids every week. Practice makes perfect, there is no other way
---
It's only good cause we forced to use it... And it kills people...
---
Did they nerf distribution/dynamo? Because I feel like it doesn't work or maybe it just gives me a little super energy even though there is an enemy right next to me
---
Gulch on EDZ.  Hop across after you land.  Get one on the top there.  Go to the valley where the tunnel is, there is always one there (near the broken vehicles or trees and sometime on the other side near where the PE spawns), Go up the road ramp on the other side.  There is usually one either on the ramp, at the top somewhere or in the alcove below the roadway.  Repeat.  3 dusk light in less than 3 minutes.  By the time you get back up top, the one there has respawned.  
---
Only issue is if there are blueberries running around messing up the order by getting them before you, then just respawn to get a new instance.
---
Yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes
---
Five free grenades if you're quick actually! It's insane
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Did but all she had was the exotic ornament. Worse still, those thing were on my hard drive until I reinstalled the game and dlc. Now there gone just like the season pass.
---
Buddy if you think bungie is going to respond to you on Reddit you’re delusional
---
I used to have a guy in my class that was so ignorant to how destiny 2 played that he used to say... im not joking, he used to say fortnite was a much better game
---
My response was in reference to being in super. Void melee kills, outside of super, give super energy.
---
MOM GET THE CAMERA!!
---
Known issue. They are looking into it.
---
The praxic order will decide your fate
---
Known bug on PC.  Bungie posted about this 2 days ago.
---
(425) 440-6800
---
Google really isn't a hard tool to use
---
i reckon next season, cuz bungie brought a bunch of trials legends to test smth
---
Just as well. They are delusional if they think I will give up.
---
They are too good to be defeated by a child’s play thing, they must respond to such acts by messaging the assailant “REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE”
---
No one said you had to move out. But if you don’t at the very least contribute anything to the house through chores or income, then it is pretty entitled of you to complain about being kicked off of a game. Life is going to hit you hard if you consider this to be unfair.
---
Love it
---
I agree. I'll go into Crucible with the same weapons I use in PvE.
---
I think i played crucible only 10 times from the release of D2 most of it just for Last Word and Thorn and thank god Subjunctive kinda replaces Recluse.
---
Not sure but I think they're called voltaic motes and relay defender
---
thanks, how do you say it instead of equilibrate ? I thought we said it in english
---
Maybe you're not doing it fast enough
---
Guardians who take crucible seriously failed at every other FPS game.
---
Gunnora's Axe is better. Fight me.
---
It has matchmaking
---
My poor brain isn’t sure if it should signal laughter or terror at the ragdoll pose that Hunter got thrown into.
---
Ding
---
I logged out for an hour or so before trying again and managed to get things done... I might just have to log out and back or wait if it happens a bunch. I remember the first time I tried s forge it happened but at the time I thought it was because I'd misunderstood when it said "matchmaking" for it. 
---
Looking back it's sad, I totally ignored the entire black armoury for a year or more because of it, all because matchmaking dumped me solo into a forge and I got shit on at a lowish power level with no idea what to expect so just thought it wasn't possible 
---
I wonder how many other people have had a similar experience.
---
Actually, Queenbreaker has a faster charge time of 300. However, it is an exotic so that's understandable.
---
How do you get shrouded stripes
---
Best way to get faster progress is to just do random stuff you’d usually do and get to level 11 in the season pass for the initial boost to catalysts progression.
---
My man no one is upset about the one shot throwing knife we are upset about it refunding on headshots without an exotic
---
Maybe thats just your opinion about hunter ?
---
[removed]
---
But the knives require a lot of skill to hit with ...
---
Lots of buddies converting from titan shoulder charging to hunter knife throwing as we speak.
---
This isn’t out yet, is it?
---
You gotta be fast
---
This is the main reason I run Devour for PvE. Only half joking.
---
Honestly, I understand where people are coming from TO A DEGREE. Their playstyle might have been gutted and that can be frustrating no matter who you are. 
---
That being said, (at the risk of being downvoted to The Deep) I agree with this post. Linear fusion rifles were in every match I played on Tuesday. I'm already not a great PVPer, so I was not ready for that. However, I buckled up, took out Arbalest, and got busy with the rest of them. I learned and adapted which caused me to improve almost immediately. (I'm Still kinda trash though lol)
---
The moment you give up on learning/adapting you have failed yourself. It is what it is, it's on nobody but you if your going to improve.
---
 In my lowly opinion, the worst players are the ones who refuse to learn anything new, no matter what kind of stats you pull.
---
Hmm i doubt that, so whats the runes ?
---
You can delete and reinstall the game in steam hopefully that will fix it
---
Everything with the season of dawn after the introductory quest is only accessible with the season pass. So give bungo some dollars
---
It's hard to line up the shot with the delay and can only take out one opponent at a time, the other two have AOE allowing multiple kills from one charge, it's actually fairly ballanced.
---
Looks like they both just got in shotty range. Gun looks cool though.
---
so if I play my hunter I should just play it with scout, sniper and other pssy weapons because of my class weakness ?
---
and I follow what you say during a game you're never into close range fight if you don't want to ? that would be nice if it was possible, but unlucky 6v6 and 3v3 doesnt allow it. 
---
Maybe for a futur 1v1 mode ?
---
The game is full of hunters, I might add.  Most used class.
---
Of course they complain about everyone else's kit.  Hopefully Bungie sticks with the statistics, because they should be ready for a knife nerf by the end of this season, it'll be used that much.
---
hunters are so cool that he killed that guy just by laying near him
---
The data already existed in the game
---
This
---
That only applies to the current season weapon catalyst (symmetry)
---
6 knives, 6 deaths. Simple equation.
---
"It TaKeS SkILl". No it does not, the knife has the hotbox of a semi truck
---
Chiropteran would like a word with you.
---
They said there will be other means of obtaining it
---
I would save it for the next season pass, you will get ships, ghosts, ornaments and stuff like that. You just have to wait
---
Lol you Say that shit everywhere, what are the runes so ?
---
my 1200+ hours says otherwise. Not saying they didn’t exist, but at least queenbreaker was balanced
---
I got a uriels gift with random rolls yesterday.
---
The supremacy from last wish is good PvP and possible to get solo and without DLC. There’s an out of bounds glitch in the dreaming city that you can use to get to the chest between the first and second encounter.
---
The does titan melee hammer 1 shot?
---
“I call this one, the Saint-14”
---
And, can I get these if II am a New Light Player?
---
Specifically, Mars Combo Detector?
---
Hilarious. I’d use the hell out of that shell.
---
Call of duty vibes are strong in this clip
---
Wtf just a regular forge?
---
Oh sorry, I could have been clearer! I just meant it can be good to save multiple rolls of the same armor piece. For instance I have a chest piece with very high Discipline that I use for Crucible, and then a different one that has other stats prioritized for PvE. Also, it's good to keep at least one of each element for each slot because of element specific mods.
---
I like how people are complaining about the hitbox, how it returns, and all. 
---
No one complained about when it was no charge up, returned the full knife *pretty sure*, and had a big hitbox in Destiny 1
---
Bruh they frikin yeet me in Sundail
---
Be disruption guy and let some1 else deal with unstopable and barriers
---
#Ding!
---
The throwing knife actually takes some semblance of skill to do. I think they got this right. Also I’m a warlock main so I’m not biased here
---
Nitpick? You don’t see this shit everywhere?
---
Kid yesterday said “honestly” and “to be honest”in the same damn sentence. 
---
The irony is your dramatic as fuck “grammatical history” statement when talking about nitpicking. 
---
It has nothing to do with grammar. I am confused how you don’t see that. 
---
It’s how people say stuff like “i think recluse is better than bad reputation, to be honest”. 
---
 
---
“Saint 14 trailer was intense, to be honest”
---
“Honestly, it’s still really good to be honest”
---

---
Sorry, that's the best answer I got.
---
Yeah. people who take crucible seriously are the people who wouldn’t or couldn’t make the school sports team but would take gym class sports seriously like it mattered. If crucible feels great and you don’t notice/recognize the inconsistency of hit registration due to P2P then I got some beachfront time shares to sell you in Kansas.
---
I'll keep my Thorn.

when has anything in destiny ever balanced itself out? i thought we learned that with icebreaker.

There is absolutely no reason to get this infuriated over the phrase "to be honest." It's frankly childish that you're acting like this, to be honest
---
What?
---
And I wouldn’t even bother mentioning how much of a dumpster fire crucible is if it wasn’t for Bungo continually giving out comp exclusive weapons that are amazing/BiS for PVE.
---
Does stacking ordinance mods not reduce the charge time the same amount as stacking strength mods? The only way hunters are going to get it any faster is by using gamblers dodge right beside you first.
---
Exactly how I felt last season. Just gotta wait for a new one.
---
*I SMELL SNITCHES*
---
420 every day
---
Is the new warlock melee (top tree) any good?
---
and the headshot immediate cool down. kinda important considering that’s the only thing that can OHK you.
---
The Speaker did Osiris dirty when he had him exiled. The only reason he loves Saint-14 is bc he buys into his lie of speaking for the traveler and follows his word fervently.
---
Yeah, see? Dramatic. I said “lol” cause i was genuinely laughing at how ridiculous it was. 
---
But, seriously. Nice try. Dishonesty was your go to? Childish, if I’m being honest.
---
Honestly it’s one of my favorite guns now, put 81 kills on it in the 7 games I played with it. It 3 bursts supers to the head, four to the body and three bursts guardians under 8-9 resilience to the body
---
Quick question. How weak of a person do you gotta be to read “lol” and think someone’s “infuriated”? Especially via text. 
---
Zero tone, just nothing but “lol”. And you’re either choosing to be a liar or...you somehow got intimidated that hard via text. And that is just sad (to be honest)
---
Either one. Normal, Comp, Iron Banner, Gambit. All I ever use is the same stuff I go into PvE with.
---
Nah mate. It's definitely shit. The only time Blade Barrage was good was pre-nerf. People like to deny Hunters getting neglected,  but it's true. We have complained for so long, and bungie gave us.. a knife. That has a 2 second animation before you even throw the thing.
---
I know your pain now
---
It's feeling a bit like that.  I'm only recently back from stopping during Y1 and Warlocks still feel a bit on the short end of the stick.
---
From what I can tell, it's only bent during the inspection. If you go to preview the full Eververse set, you can see that it's mostly straight, and only warps with head position.
---
Not ideal, I know.
---
Somehow I’ve personally never seen this happen
---
I'm so rocking this, "my milkshake brings all the guardians to the yard"

If you're UK, and even better, based in/ near Bristol, the Forbidden Planet at the top of Park Street has that very mug you're looking for (as well as a bunch of ghosts). I hope this helps guardian 🤘🏻

You have to go into PvP as part of the intro missions to the game, so you can jump right in from there.  To be in fact it is recommended as a great way to lvl up and get gear.  
---
Weapons do matter.  You will find that there are meta PvP weapons.  There are some that take a long time to grind out (Not Forgotten, Luna's Howl), and some that do not take quite as long to grind; but there are other weapons in the game that if not just as good, come close.  If you want to get an idea of Meta PvP weapons, search it on Youtube.  Look for more recent videos (within the last month or two).  One of those weapons (Recluse) was just nerfed this weak, and while it will not be the beast it was it is still a good weapon to get.
---
Not gonna lie to you, Destiny 2 PvP is not the greatest when it comes to match making.  They just implemented skill based match making in competitive (Survival).  Play some see how it goes and then decide how to handle it.  There are different modes of PvP you can play.  Rotator modes change weekly and have some really fun modes like Mayhem (supers every where), Momentum Control (Amps up the power to your weapons), and Iron Banner (lvl advantages means you do more damage to lower light players and take less from them also).  Core Modes are always part of the game (Rumble- everyone for them selves-no teams), Survival- 3 man team limited revives-can stack a fireteam of 3 if you want, and Survival: Frelance- 3 man team, but no fireteams, everyone gets 2 blueberries to play with). 
---
There are weapons that require a quest to obtain them.  There is no set time it would take to obtain them, it will depend on your abilities to do the requirements (Hubby can get precision hand cannon kills much faster than I can, so he will get those types of weapons faster than I will).  But just so that you understand, a skilled player can go into PvP with blue weapons and still come out on top.  Do not let the fact that you do not have the same weapons deter you from doing the activities.
---
Destiny 2 is a PvE game with PvP activities.  There are a lot of PvP players in the community, but balancing weapons and armor can be an issue for Bungie because nerfing for one activity will affect the other (the recluse nerf is a good example of this).  A big part of this game is the lore and collectibles.  There are good weapons that will require PvE activities to get.  Even the PvE stuff in this game is multiplayer and 98% of it can be done in a fireteam of 3 or more.  So, you may find there are parts of the PvE stuff, like Gambit/Gambit Prime that you enjoy doing because it combines both PvE and PvP into one activity.
---
Same. And the standard Hunter finisher should knock them back before they pop.
---
I liked him in The Fringe. :)
---
Izanagi's w/ catalyst

If you find them in collections it will tell you how to get them.

Just need to do 12 daily bounties &amp; one weekly, so I’ll have to wait until Tuesday to get a new weekly anyway but at least I’ve got the damn thing ready !!!
---
No! No! No! You got a voidstreak sparrow!
---
Or any firing line, 4th times the charm roll is good
---
Hunters have never had a OHK though
---
you might try r/DestinyTechSupport for help.
---
New light/ newly made characters cant get bounties until they do the intro quests and complete the bounty intro quest.
---
That’s what I thought I hadn’t found anything I figured I’d ask just to make sure thanks
---
they had in D1
---
Minihammers don't 1 hit without buffs though, tbh I'd be more impressed if someone did this with hammers
---
Mine was where I had to do 6 forges and yesterday was the easiest forte so took about a hour to get them done
---
You might try r/DestinyTechSupport for help.
---
Got the same roll, you should see that thing in EP
---
I farmed lost sectors with fighting lion, any strike. Takes a bit of time, its a grind. Not extremely bad grind though
---
Ya because using the crimson alone with a one hit melee and a helmet that if you were to get ya fat ass shit you then get to do extra damage against me and see and pretty much get true site. And if you kill me good luck to my teammate with a Titan that now has full health and probably pulls out his little pee shooter recluse and begins to just melt everyone. ( Alternate ending) -- you get a melee one punch kill and now your your melee buff is active to allow your bottom tree Titan to go on a punching spree with a target acquisition of pretty much anywhere on your screen to then also have health Regin...... Yup but it's funny how all those one eyed mask bottom tree striker God players are getting torn apart. . . . Que in a clip of Ricky Bobby asking what should I do with my hands..... Lol RIP trashcans you've had your 3 months of fun now let the big boys play and go back to your "pub stomping"  LFG posts where you join in and lose and leave because it was everyone else's fault that  you ran in head first screaming has "has anyone seen my baseball?" And get shot TF up. 😉😉😉
---
Not in my experience. Yesterday I beat a strike in the infinite forest twice by myself.
---
I get your point but I’ll take the wallhacks over the overshield honestly. You can outgun a titan that is tracking you for sure. Of course I get your point with the tracking while you try to reposition and flank the titan will be watching your every move, but if you play smart and land your shots you can outgun them. I think a big problem with OEM was the instant health regen along with like an 8 second overshield lol. It let titans bully people and engage in fights they wouldn’t get into without insta overshield. I’ve seen titans run through 3 people team shooting because he’s sliding around with a shotty or recluse getting health regen and overshield for each kill. Without the overshield you don’t see those overly aggressive plays as much because it means possibly trading lives a lot more than it had pre nerf. Just my opinion really though
---
It’s a trials of the nine mark. Mark Judgment.
---
When? I've played since around Dark Below launch and to my knowledge they've never been able to 1 hit without a super gimmicky exotic
---
If that is what I think it is, that Titan mark is no longer obtainable. That's "Trials of the Nine" gear. And Trials is no longer playable
---
I bought the full game, and loved it for the first few hours until the inherent problems were too obvious to ignore. From what I’ve checked in on, they have abandoned it and it is a flop. It’s a damn shame. It could have been one of the best shooters ever in my mind.
---
it helps but sadly i am not in the uk! thanks for the heads up i have searched far and wide for the damn thing over the last 2 months so i turned to reddit to see if anyone has some suggestions
---
Could you do anything to it?
---
Sounds like a nail gun
---
Once you beat a strike, it sends you to orbit to matchmake. There is absolutely no way you did it twice solo, in a row
---
It happens when everyone is spread. Nothing like dying to enemy's super just to respawn and die to it again immediately lol. I can't even be mad, it's funny to me.
---
And honestly no one talks about this, but when the hell are they gonna give arcstrider a good buff? Besides top tree, its near useless
---
Throwing knives were OHK to the head in D1, same goes for tripmines and you could stick those to enemies
---
LOL.
---
Actually it's Solstice of the Dawning of the Revelry of the Festival of the Lost Forest.

Bungie seems to have their wires crossed lately

Tripmines were oneshots but IIRC throwing knives only did ~150 damage to the head, and couldn't kill without prior damage.

Amazon has an entire selection of them:

It sounds weaker than that.
---
are you sure you played D1 :D
---
Gotta love glitches, probably exploded on the vandal that passed by him before the finisher registered
---
Sounds like a nail gun on metal then?
---
Nobody is bragging, that’s just how you took it. From this I’m just assuming you’ve never played D1 and therefore you think I’m rubbing it in, so no Im not bragging. I’m trying to establish that I’ve played a ton, invested time into different aspect while still hundreds of hours of D2. I’m not bragging, it’s just important to understand that I’m invested and care about the game.
---
If only cayde 6 had this ghost shell
---
Oh cool. Is this new?
---
sadly none of these are the coffee mug she had this was a special deal with a journal and maybe a pen ? but i cannot find it even on amazon!
---
😂😂
---
That’s deep
---
I apologize I should have stated that you can not interact with it. However I have a good feeling this will be part of the quest.
---
Here comes the "OEM BAD PLZ NERRRRRF" comments.
---
Yup, you can also rival a golden gun.
---
These emotes are Silver-Only on Eververse.
---
Oh ok thanks for the heads up. I obviously haven't gotten it yet lol
---
No please, I’m only a crayon eating titan. What wrong could I do?
---
Learn how 2 Taken Goblins defeated Vanguard with this simple trick.
---
I’m really not meaning to be a jerk, but most of your Arbalest kills should be precision kills. It’s an easy gun to use. If you can’t get 15 kills in match, the quest is going to take you a lot longer than it should
---
Ok boomer.
---
Nope, im missing Y1 random drop exotics, like the Sunshot.
---
This is exactly what he means
---
So true 🤣🤣
---
Bwahahahahaha!!!!
---
Maybe, I'm not sbtirely sure.  I'm new to shit posting
---
I would like it more if this was the front, and that was an eye. A derpy, smiling cyclops
---
For the first step you had to get to heroic and as soon as you got heroic 1 you were done.
---
Implying headshots are hard against red legion lmao
---
Incorrect. There's no link between being bad and recognizing when something needs to be toned down.
---
Nerfs need to exist to keep broken and cheap tactics in check in a competitive environment. When something is blatantly broken, it either needs to be cut down or everything else needs to be buffed to its level. Guess what's easier to do.
---
oh god oh fuck
---
Check out rank 12 of the Season. Increases active links by 1.
---
I'm on PS4 can can preview it through thew badge.
---
I'd say if you want to stay on top or get ahead of it, once you finish the time gated Osiris quest steps and things for the week, knock out your Vanguard/Crucible/Gambit ritual weapon quests and shaders/emblem quests asap. These will have to be done for the badge to get the seal.
---
It's kind of like a sniper-bow. Once you get a feel for the charge time it pretty much does the same thing as a sniper rifle, except not quite as well.
---
It's more likely than you think
---
Wow, you've really polarized what I've said all in your own head, that's on you child. I've made way more points, if you are capable of reading properlly, you just won't address them. You've obviously never played D1 so you quite literally don't understand what I'm talking about, so I understand why you're ignoring the points. You also don't understand you're in the vast minority if you don't care about half the loot pool. When you say "I'm playing dress up" you're talking about the vast majority who value half the loot. You're claiming that you think half the rewards in the game are useless. The gear itself matters, and the aesthitics do to, just like it every other MMORPG. What a weird take to have on armour lmao. I was really being quite kind to kids who I know aren't good at the game, like yourself, I complain because I want the series to great. You're not very smart if you think people should just give up and move on when things don't go your way. You're just showing that you're a quitter than doesn't like debate. You can't take criticism and you just want it to go away. People care about hardcores, endgame, PvP, trials, and you digging your head in the sandwon't change anything. I'd argue that you should play D1for the first time adn learn about what myself and many other people are talking about before you speak so ignorantly. hopefully that will allow you to leave your echochamber of confirmation bias on this sub adn you can form your own opinion.
---
I'd buy silver to pay for this!
---
I’d have to disagree honestly. I would love the wallhacks to only last 2 seconds, but again, even if the wall hacks were only 2 seconds and overshield was active you’d still get titans making overly aggressive plays spamming people with shottys or recluse. You take away the overshield and now they play more passive because they have to risk of dying a lot easier now instead of just spamming and shoulder charging to activate the overshield and go on a rampage. With wallhacks you still have to hit your shots to kill me, rather than getting an almost 10 seconds overshield and slide sprinting toward me with a shotty until I’m dead. Wallhacks are whack don’t get me wrong, but overshield needed to go
---
Not sure why though? Vow is one of the best exotic weapons available
---
He appears on weekends at a random location
---
Well I know who to a-void
---
I don't think you really can argue that though, since it takes up a power slot and uses heavy ammo. 
---
There are better options for every scenario in PvP since getting five opportunities for headshots is less reliable than three with a grenade launcher or a guaranteed kill from rockets. 
---
You also can't really argue that it is the best linear  fusion rifle since arbalest doesn't cripple itself with the heavy ammo requirement and kills in the same way.
---
In the end even if it was the best of it's class it's class is still trash tier like bows and sidearms so... yeah. I thought I might be missing something but i think now people must just be caught up in the hype
---
&gt;Incorrect. There's no link between being bad and recognizing when something needs to be toned down.
---
I never said that. I said people on the opposite end of the spectrum who are praising it.
---
Smart™
---
I disagree with this but upvote first your sheer courage
---
A bad workman blames his tools.
---
spent a good half hour laughing with my friends at this
---
r/bettereveryloop except it loops for you
---
So praising the overly needed OEM nerf is the sign of a bad player? Then most of the existing playerbase is bad at PvP.
---
Izanagi with cat or tranquility with firing line are good damage snipers.
---
lmfao nice
---
Yeah, I feel the same. The only reason arbalest even makes it to troll weapon status is that it can use special ammo, but there really isn't any reason to use a linear fusion rifle over anything else. Kind of like bows and sidearms
---
I have a lot of pvp kills with skyburner. But then again, i can aim
---
It’s Russian he’s from the Russian cosmodrome
---
Tried both and nothing happened.
---
HE SPEAK WITH A TONUGE FROM THE MOTHERLAND
---
It sounds more like someone spiking a railroad
---
Yeah sorry didnt clarify that
---
But that's like every gun in destiny already lol
---
At x15 bosses become dregs
---
Hell yes
---
I suppose the only rationale here is it's $10, so expecting forsaken level content for $10 is unrealistic. This will probably be something I did similar to last season where I let everything pile up and did it afterwards when there was enough content for weeks of continuous play.
---
Ill strike you down for your putting me in the group of bad titans with that statement sir
---
Keep in mind, he killed that fallen leader with a headbutt. You can even see the dent on the side of the exotic:
---
In the aftermath of the Battle of the Twilight Gap, Saint-14 hunted down Solkis, Kell of the House of Devils, whom was one of the instigators of the Fallen's attempted assault on the Last City. The two fought a fierce battle, with Saint-14 expending most of his Light during their fight. He managed to defeat the Kell by gathering his remaining Light into a headbutt, using the horn of his helm to pierce Solkis' head.
---
The challenge is at the Bridge of Folly lol
---
Your hammer isn't actually broken, and there are many other hammers to choose from.
---
Thanks bud
---
I love doing this i feel bad because it wasnt anything i did to make it happen it just does but it honesrly is so satisfying when your enemies have nowhere to hide
---
The Legion would’ve won if they had just sent more Drop Pods
---
Ok but my wheelbarrow DID break (the tire has a huge gash in it) and I can't afford a new one until tomorrow. I have to use a 10 gallon bucket to do my job. Concrete is really fucking heavy. Damn right I'm gonna blame that wheel lol.
---
swear, only started my WL and i LOVE that exotic... devour + nezarecs + void weapon = You get a nade and you get a nade! You get a nade too!
---
Respect vuvuzela
---
I think you've lost the metaphor.
---
I do wish the Hunter one was cool spinning tricks with the Golden Gun rather than just a knife.
---
Look man, I'm just here to talk about tools
---
Just gonna say i love the new animation for throwing knives
---
But it just shows Bungie tendency for Nerfs, PvP, i get it, PvE, they nerf stuff that makes the game FUN, not every crazy min/max we pull out is to one phase bosses y'know.
---
Don't let them find out.
---
yeah i’ve noticed that too
---
With the new glitch showing the trials wins and losses i hope this armor comes back because I AM SO TIRED OF WEARING MAN SKIRTS WHEN I PLAY WARLOCK!
---
Is their a way to grind for the sord of your class
---
Somebody REALLY appreciates you.
---
Intellect and recovery because intellect for super recovery. Recovery itself because not only does it give you faster regen, but in this sandbox you and decrease the time if your rifts I believe.
---
SPEEEEN
---
Just in case you are not aware, Bungie doesn't go here. You can't file bug reports here, you should use the official forums or *maybe* /r/destinythegame.
---
Oh, I am sorry, I don't know what the solution is.
---
After you open the tangled show obelisk, go back to Osiris
---
And this is why people get all pissed off when it doesn’t come back, why get hyped over a simple bug, this is probably a visual bug from files of the original trials of the nine.
---
Don’t get hyped over something that they have clearly said multiple times that it’s not coming back yet, crucible is a shit show if they brought trials back we would have people coming here crying about how it’s all fucked up and they need to fix it. Set expectations low they are a lone developer now it’s going to take time
---
No no, he's got a point
---
That's so hilariously true 😂

I made this post in Bungie help forum. Coz even i want to know what's gonna happen. Keep tabs on this one - hope they reply soon.

You guys are getting exotics?
---
Fair, but as someone who switched from PS4 to PC, the load times are substantially shorter.
---
Yes I am using an SSD, but both the Xbox One and PS4 use 5400RPM HDDs, and most PCs use 7200RPM HDDs.
---
well stop being poor ffs
---
This is wonderful!
---
Fun fact: if you jump off the platform with the shield looking thing you can make people yell
---
Damn that's hot
---
If by exactly the same you mean changed, sure.
---
You might as well keep grinding for the armour, there’s a bunch of Triumphs associated with forge-grinding and there are other special quests that could drop in the meantime. Also armour will drop occasionally when forging frames (both types) so your odds of completing a set are pretty good.
---
I just hope there’s more Egyptian themed armor. It’d be sick to have Anhur(lion), Sobek(crocodile), and Khepri(beetle) themed gear
---
Honestly, I hate meta changes because I usually load in to Crucible to have fun with whatever gun I like (sometimes AoS, sometimes Riskrunner, sometimes Last Word, etc. I like to use whatever gun feels fun to use, regardless of whether its any good), and suddenly I can't do that because I'm spending several matches adapting to the new meta so I can still use those guns. I play Crucible for a fun time, not to beat the everloving shit out of the enemy. So I admit to being frustrated when I happily go into Crucible to derp around with one of my favorite weapons and just get steamrolled by Recluse or whatever.
---
... You can be whatever u feel like friend/fellow guardian. I prefer male characters.. Feel too much like a flanders in his ski suit (stupid sexy flanders)...
---
I understand the smart ass infographic your gf did for you.. I did the same kinda thing when my gf asked about baby yoda and i went into way too much detail about the back story for a normal person..
---
The upgrade includes the current season pass but no more. They stated that they removed the deluxe at the end of undying
---
I love the added animation time, it feels so much smoother ironically
---
Are you going for Komodo?
---
I much preferred the European Helvetica zone, myself.
---
U just brought back memories I never thought I’d have again
---
it may be because of nvidia's new driver. can't say for sure though
---
Do you live in the USA?
---
Not gonna upvote this because you can overcome an addiction.
---
Your character looks hideous
---
Cute haha
---
Bastet, Thoth would be cool as well
---
Yep
---
I have to admit I suck with controllers 😂 cuz atm I play on free time with console as I'm not at home for some times because of my job
---
BUT even If I suck with controllers, without being a god I'm still good at fps overall. Especially on pc where I reached global on cs:go on 2 account and did some lans on source and 1.6 back in the days, I'm playing Halo since the first one and I spent most of my chillhood on games like quake or starcraft. 
---
So even if I don't considere myself good on controllers because tbh I'm kind of a "pc main" and I maybe got the 1/10 of my skills with controllers compared to playing with a mouse, I still have enough knowledge and habits from other fps I grinded on pc to not be as bad as you think and thats why I made this post. 
---
Everyone here is taking this seriously and personnal but I'm just giving my opinion and my feelings, you all can disagree but don't judge, it's too much american-stereotypical (idk how to say that word lol) to judge others opinions
---
and tbh if even me can solo win streak at 5500 on controllers I think most of the players can do it with some tryhard sessions, thats not a pride ; even more if you play duoQ or trioQ.
---
 When you compare the skillgap of destiny top tier players with other fps more "raw" without that rpg / abilities aspect thats not the same level. On destiny only few players are above the "top tier" and can be considered godtier or pro player, compare it to cs where millions of ppl are playing and tryharding the game : the "god tier" players are much more (logical btw) so obviously the skillgap is higher AND it's harder to step up. Destiny pvp is half casual / half esport-like that what is frustrating, biggest example is that bungie wants players to tryhard with op exotics made for casu... wheres the point  ? I dont get it
---
Yessir, or somebody’s trying to get a couple days off to play Destiny 2 themselves, maybe? ;) 
---
Keep up the great work!
---
Ooooo I didn’t think of Bastet, scratch Khepris
---
Really appreciate the effort you went to in order to explain the system. I’m having some trouble following your outline, but I think I got the basics.  Thanks.
---
Voidshigi.
---
Thank you. It was a nice surprise when I took over last March; knowing I’d have someone to talk to about Destiny. Both of us are huge fans of the game.  And yes, he’s definitely earned a few extra “sick” days.

I've already been collecting a bunch of other vanilla Häkke weapons, they shoot well and look good once you get some Häkke History shader on there. I like to use them together, a SoF would definitely compliment my Antiope, Halfdan or Zenobia.
---
and yeah hunter gang forever, I'm salty but after few days tryharding titan I came back to hunter. Even If I rage it still fits more my playstyle
---
I think I'm gonna get a try to warlock next week
---
I think I'll be needing that
---
Anyone having this problem? Since the Season of Dawn dropped, my Window Mode in my Video Settings keep getting reset to Fullscreen. I usually play in Windowed Fullscreen and it sucks having to set it back everytime I start the game.
---
You decided to purchase it with silver.
---
Nailed it
---
Ight guess I’m wasting 10 bucks
