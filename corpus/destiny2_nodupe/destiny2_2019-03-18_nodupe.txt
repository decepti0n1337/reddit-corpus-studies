Hey! It's good to know there are others who have aternally cursed their accounts with a 666 Thorn! Congrats.

The blocker is not sent in such situation.

Beats that play exclusively Destiny music. I'd buy them in a heartbeat (No pun intended).
---
AKA add clearing without ammo. Has made strikes 50% shorter, love this combo
---
Try running full screen if you're running a windowed option, or it'll do that if you're playing videos or running apps on your other monitors while playing games. Could also just be a limitation on your GPU. Destiny might also just be poorly optimized for PC and if you're unlucky it'll just run at your other 2 monitors rates because frick you to hek. Happens to me all the time and I haven't figured a definite solution.

They doubled glory gain/loss in this season. You really should make a habit of reading patch notes and TWAB.
---
*bows down*
---
Amusing absence of proper aim and other players not killing you in one second.
---
Ooooh, yeah, I've gotten that in the reckoning a lot.  Freaking sucks.
---
Isn't the cheese possible still?
---
I'm sitting in a taco bell drive thru and my wife is hyperventilating laughing at that one
---
The first 1000 glory is super easy to get to, the matches will feel like regular Quickplay 
---
Try to queue with a 4 stack cause by the time you hit 1000 you‚Äôll probably have a 5 steak and a 4 stack will help keep the momentum going, any progress you make from there is huge and shouldn‚Äôt take you more than a day or so to finish it
---
Definitely down but I doubt I'll have anytime to play today
---
Gonna need venta black
---
Space hobos need love too üíö
---
Oh yeah , I saw something like that.  Idk though the way they changed it was if you had a 51% win rate you‚Äôd still be losing glory, but now at 51% you don‚Äôt have a deficit anymore 
---
right, like I'd consider myself pretty far from sweaty, but I put in a bunch of time and grinded comp to get the pinnacle weapons. Honestly I don't even like using luna's because my aim isn't good enough to consistently 3 tap. And the friend I play a lot of my games with has what can only be described as average stats has hit fabled for the pinnacle weapon in every season.
---
That said I love playing quickplay I can just run around and shoot stuff, also I don't have to care about wining or losing.  I could go play comp but I don't like 4v4 as much and I'd probably say countdown is my least favorite game type. 
---
Honestly dust rock is probably the easiest weapon in game to farm, of course it shows up a bunch in crucible.  And there's a bunch of good legendary kin/energy weapons so using the exotic in the heavy make sense,  wardcliff just works most of the time. 
---
If anything I'd say running in a large team is an issue,  and even there it's hard to quantify there's been a bunch of times where I've had a 4-5 stack on my team and still been the best player on the team.  Playing with your friends should be something that should be overall good for the game.  I guess that leaves the sweaty 6 stacks and I feel like I see those so in frequently that whatever, I'll just wait for the next game. 
---
I know right
---
Yeah I know I myself was playing pretty sloppy in this video.
---
But hey, that‚Äôs console Quickplay for ya lmao 
---
I was smiling and clapping at the end. Even got a little misty eyed. Well done. 
---
Hmm. Thanks man! I hope it goes well for me. 
---
Im so glad that d3 is confirmed. I can just rest easy, knowing there'll be destiny content for years to come 
---

Considering this game is like 80% pve and 20% pvp, I think it's definitely odd that most of the newer exotic quests require a bit of pvp. In my mind, this is a pve game with some pvp on the side, and in trying to be an even split between both, many players will be unhappy. 
---
For example, pve players consider this season worthless to them because "it's all pvp except reckoning," while pvp players do not view gambit as pvp at all and feel they have been completely forgotten for months. 
---
[This was the second result on google.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9dizev/nightfall_specific_loot_infographic_version_2_ive/) Every Tuesday to Friday, there's a weekly reset infographic pinned to the front page of this subreddit that shows the unique nightfall items. 
---
Cool cool. Thanks for the post. Does anyone have official word on whether the IB counts towards Glory? I heard that‚Äôs true. Haven‚Äôt found anything confirming it. Also, if true, what‚Äôs the pointing system when active? Same as Comp? Same as QP? A mix? I kinda feel IB is giving Comp points because my Glory was in the 500s last season and I barely played Comp and played some IB.
---
Thanks!
---
Should've went for the head...

One exotic I really want

Ps4 - of clan to help me catchup to what I missed so 've calus release, bought all expacs and passes, finished forsaken campaign in city progress, working on finishing up thorn LW, hoping to acquire 1000 voices and intend on raiding.
---
28 yrs old, raiding xp on Guild Wars 2, love hunter.
---
Drew_P_Bowls  is psn
---
You‚Äôd be surprised, I‚Äôve won plenty of 2v4s by accident. 3v4s feel no different to 4v4s (in my opinion) when you have good teammates 
---
Hahah fair enough! Well I am happy you have gotten 2 characters to max LL. I am at 683 with my main. Getting close to max!
---
You take the moon
---
Dem lost motes, tho.
---
I am looking forward to Invitations of the Nine every week! 
---
Wait good or bad?
---
seriously. that cutscene has me hyped for the next
---
Level 50.
---
Bug
---
Ooooooh misunderstood sorry
---
The armor is originally green but the shader turns it red and black
---
12 bucks well spent 
---
Got that on my first Last Wish raid (guided) last night, along with Supremacy.
---
The clan that guided me was great but they were cheesed at my luck, LOL.
---
So essentially "no one can have any power at all and i have to be super overpowered or else the game is stupid and unfair"
---
I don't think anyone thinks the top two are balanced. Can't speak for hand cannons 
---
Pulse Rifles ftw!
---
People with Luna‚Äôs and NF can‚Äôt play the only two other playlists other than the rotating one? Stop complaining about the gun and get one for yourself, it‚Äôs easier than ever. 
---
No the problem is that I can‚Äôt even get the starter for it
---
I wish this was an actual destiny movie. I'd pay to see it.
---
More like remove Thorn, Last Word, Shotguns and Queens Breaker and knee cap Hunters and we're good.
---
I run that same gun and shader in the crucible, but I got snapshot and opening shot on mine!
---
I fucking love skull of ahamkara! It's the best!!!
---
Just the zone wipes you can with it is üò§üò§
---
Great. üëç 
---
Not yours lost, the enemy team lost due to invading kills. GLORIOUS.
---
Icebreaker, yes. G horn, eh. I like the idea of a viable exotic rocket launcher that actually works like a rocket laucher (looking at you wardcliff) but if they brought back G horn that would really just be a cry for help since it‚Äôs literally the most iconic weapon in D1
---
See I would love to learn how to snipe. One problem with that. I'm bad
---
Except.. bannershield, melting point, and hammers are all amazing and almost required for every year 1 raids damage in d2. Titans have never been useless or had "limited" use in raids, ever. Warlocks are *only* useful in d1 as self res and *only* useful in d2 as lunas. Nothing else.
---
This is gold 
---
link is broken
---
LOL.
---
Glad it wasn't me who ran with you guys then!

I can here the warlock screaming

Holy shit that‚Äôs awesome

AhhhhhhhHHHHHH!

OG Ghost

It‚Äôs just more fun to in my opinion, doubles should be brought back more often than it is 
---
It‚Äôs funny, your Awoken looks exactly like mine lol 
---
*Laughs in Attunement of Hunger*
---
Nah, its only banter between us. Nobody got seriously upset but when i left the discord i heard a few friendly fuck yous.
---
Yes. Your choice in the quest has no effect on your ability to start/complete the thorn quest. 
---
Also The Corrupted right before you jump into the Pit of Misery with all the minotaurs and phalanxes
---
And wormhusk doesnt cut it
---
Haha same, and also my character‚Äôs ass in the game
---
But nobody uses Wardcliff.
---
I swear if you get 1k I‚Äôll be happy for you but pissed it took me 50 full clears and a total of like 59 chests to get
---
This just reinforces my dream of having an Ace of Spades replica that's actually a functioning firearm.
---
Because who wouldn't want to really shoot Ace in real life, let's be real.
---
What about his disappearing cloak
---
Thank you! Also I‚Äôm sorry I took you so many
---
"THIS IS AMAZING!"
---
[removed]
---
Next up: J√∂tunn
---
Aye and that we do in the city. If there's another cataclysm coming then the Drifter is free to tell anyone some actual information about it.
---
Bane of my existence. Looks amazing though!
---
I see a fellow thorn questee running double HC... I used TLW and ikelos. Day 1 was rough. I can now say that I grinded comp until 2 in the morning in one day by using 2 hand cannons.
---
Sadly it doesn't matter how good you are, the outcome of crucible is 100% luck
---
I switched over to a warlock today after maining Titan since vanilla. I felt like a god. A God who has unlimited super and can heal allies. Never have I ever felt so good while playing a class. I never knew how underclasses I was till I switched over. 
---
Ive gotta say, I didn't think that I'd like thorn that much, but I haven't put it down since I got it. I really want malfeasance to get a buff so it compete with ace and TLW. Maybe a full HC archetype rework update is in order? Maybe a Luna and NF nerf and a malfeasance buff as well as a pve buff to crucible-oriented HCs?
---
Best of luck! Still need it myself for Rivensbane.
---
Thank you! Hope you get it too
---
Are you guys at dramatically different light levels?
---
In crucible, I've found, it seems to matter. I don't play it much but when I do I'm getting *trashed* by primarily hand cannons. Rarely do I get 2-3 tapped by anything else. I don't even have time to get off a burst from a pulse rifle or an SMG, or anything.
---
Over time, I suppose, people just get used to the burst damage and run it for everything. I love Rampage shotguns for PvE, especially with a couple Special Ammo finder perks.
---
They'd have to tune the impact of all the automatic weapons and scout rifles for them to be even remotely useful in Crucible. Or even just PvE. They're outclassed too easily. They're fun to use but seem to be victims of constant tuning "balance".
---
How do you get the ornament
---
Celesti GG one shots him.
---
Send it 
---
No mega kill. Take my upvote.
---
I've seen this before, it's [Frenzy](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Frenzy_(Movie))
---
I have submit it thanks to you guardians, still getting approved. Hopefully I'll get the emblem, heh
---
I got angry just doing my power boost quest from the Drifter last night.
---
God it's so bad. Why'd matchmaking throw me in with these tryhards? I didn't even have a valor rank lol.
---
Almost exact armor for Titans, I'd love it! 
---
But theyre fun as hell
---
Ahh yes my favourite type of hammer 
---
Same for me except adding: malfeasance (especially with this season's ornament), TLW, and Thorn
---
*2 months later...*
---
Ladies and gentlemen... We got them.
---
Oh fair point, I forgot about that. Back then I guess weapons of light was the GOAT.
---
It's a Dead Man Walking XX7463 outlaw and kill clip that randomly dropped on one of my first forges, I won't go in  Gambit without it.
---
Bow to no one
---
That explains why I went up 3 LL this week
---
Hey mate, I'm going through my old posts. I'm glad they fixed it
---
Just did that the other day trying out queenbreaker.  Drift laughed his ass off
---
And Sturm and Malf
---
What snipe is this plz, I love the small reticule
---
Omg here I am trying to do like 5 flawless on tier 3 because I thought that's what it was, I was like why am I not getting it if I didn't die at all lmao. 
---
If you get both on the same day in your first raids every I would buy a lotto ticket and ghost for a little while. Your friends may want to murder you.
---
I kid of coarse. Wish you the best of luck! I'm about 20 scourge runs in still looking for Anarchy. Got the exotic sparrow though so I guess there's that.
---
AND YOU TAKE THE MOON
---
Thanks forgot about the destiny app!
---
You're going to get some hate for using it. "It takes no skill!" üòÅ
---
If you have the time, can you elaborate why its great? I have two of these but never really used them yet. What do you mean by No Skill, No Cares?
---
What a time to be alive.
---
Rise of iron thorn?
---
Thanks man, I always wait for them to use their ability which sometimes can take longer than what I want it to be. I never thought of it this way before. Thanks man.
---
So can I get the 1k voices by playing crucible?
---
And we've got another one coming with "The Rose"!
---
Unless in a plot twist it's a pulse rifle as a riff on the whole Red Death/Crimson thing. 
---
THAT IS AWESOME‚Äô  I‚Äôm still on the Corrupted Strike step but once I get into this step I will definitely do this! Thanks
---
To be fair though, it makes a really distinctive sound and all you have to do is jump to avoid them. So while you don‚Äôt have to really aim, you do have to get in close enough to take them off guard or not give them time to react. Don‚Äôt sell yourself short; skill is really more about finding the loadout that works for you and being able to consistently execute it :) If it works, there is at least some measure of skill (and there are salty players who call anything that kills them ‚Äúno skill‚Äù because they can‚Äôt accept getting outplayed).
---
Same haha
---
I love you. Njthind like steam on you're horizon. 
---
I don't think we'll see the full implications until the next bit of DLC comes. Right now, not much has changed, but what if something does?
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
All I need is the ghost shell and the pulse from corrupted for cursebreaker. I am fairly convinced the shell doesn't exist and the corrupted will be back in rotation in 8 weeks
---
&gt;Only 5 hours a day for all 3 on 700? Damn, nice job.
---
50% 50% chance
---
Don't blame me if I lost track of time for the past few days üôÇ
---
I had free time from work, wife was away &amp; I went ham.
---
But I thought we did good?  We were orb makers(crota,aksis)and great mob control.
---
What? But golden gun with celestial nighthawk?
---
Rose?
---
F
---
Heck just did one this weekend myself... not hard at all
---
"yes it can kill you in less than a second but" are you fr?
---
I hear you, but the problem isn't going up against stacks, I'm sure you've wrecked stacks before with randoms, the main problem is the matching with guardians far lower skilled in your team to "balance" the overall matchmaking. 1 guardian can't carry a team of 4 if they are making ridiculous tactical decisions, like running in front of a sniper 5 or 6 times each invasion, or killing the 4th envoy as an invasion starts. LFG for a team if you can't play with clan or friends, takes away a lot of the frustration.
---
Thats a nice roll. I have a dragonfly shield breaker but im jealous pf the rampage perk
---
Lol, can‚Äôt un-see now. 
---
Goku isnt little. He is big boi
---
It's worth it for the big W :)
---
I love hand cannon. 
---
Shaxx calls the golden gun and blade barrage "tickle gun" and "tickle barrage" respectively.
---
Tethering Shaxx slows him down just enough for you to witness your disembowlment by his bare hands.
---
Attacking Shaxx with an electric pole or shadow knives causes them to shatter, resulting in Shaxx shoving the broken pieces up your ass.
---
Attempting to pound Shaxx with electricfied fists results in broken fists and an irate Shaxx.
---
Bludgeoning Shaxx with a void shield or solar hammer results in a lecture on proper super-usage while Shaxx rearranges the bones on your broken body.
---
Calling upon the storm to blast Shaxx with a few million volts of arc energy only spoils his phone, which you will need to get him a new one, after somebody surgically removes the old phone from your spinal cord.
---
Throwing any novabomb at Shaxx results in the "Novabomb Challenge", where Shaxx grabs it out of midair and violently inserts it in your mouth.
---
Casting Dawnblade gives you a 50/50 chance of running away from a short, painful death by Shaxx, towards a long, agonizing one when he catches up.
---
Damn, I wish I played more warlock. 
---
Barely have any exotics for him, I only have that exotic which makes your abilities regen really fast.
---
What does that /r/ meme mean?

Removed prismatic matrix due to popular demand. Now players can buy items directly, as they always wanted!

Woah that‚Äôs awesome!!  You should have aimed for the head!
---
Great vs players who don't know how to jump.
---
I only just received it from Amanda holiday last night 
---
Thanks, to YouTube it is
---
Here we go, another wave of "upvote me because three max light characters" begins. 
---
BRACE YOURSELVES
---
Still a thang
---
It‚Äôs simply fantastic in PVE, I only know of the Crimson that effectively offers infinite ammo just for killing.
---
On PC all you see is hand cannons
---
Will make sure I do this one then. Thanks. 
---
YES YES YES 
---
You kidding me? Shaxx saved that and framed a gif of it on the wall
---
Already did. For over a month. Dec-Jan 
---
Np, you get some really nice lore and a powerful drop from it. When it's finished, have a look at the npcs at the tower, i almost missed that bit
---
Dang. Sucks I missed it
---
Prospector has been great 
---
This was posted yesterday.....
---
Unstoppable force meets immovable object
---
Ooohhh im intrigued. Lol. What did you get for your drop? 
---
Malfeasance?
---
I think it's honestly the most fun meta we've had, as the Scout meta was boring as hell, while the Pulse meta was just slightly closer range scouts. Meanwhile the Auto meta... well, let's leave it that. 
---
There's so many good-decent weapons in PvP right now, about half of them are hand cannons yes, but we have pulses, smgs, fusions (erentil) are back! I'd try a few other things out my guy, personal recommendations:
---
Any erentil with backup plan
---
Cerberus+1 (hipfire grip melts shotgun apes)
---
Blast Furnace | Chattering Bone | Vig Wing (all solid)
---
Alone as a God | Twilight Oath (great snipers to get started with)
---
Trackless Waste (close quarters shredder)
---
not to mention the GP weapons
---
I played only meta last season (Ace/Retold Tale/HH), and i despised it. fell short of luna's by 62 Glory. Now, I've just been playing or fun and yeah I'm not doing great with weapons I'm just getting used to, but hey, it's game.
---
I haven't even finished my hammerhead mission, let alone playing with LMGs. I knew it was bad, but I'll have to see for myself 
---
A really crappy go figure bit it helped with my power level lol
---
Ah fair enough. When does that Xur quest expire btw? 
---
Both please! 
---
r/wooosh
---
It doesn't have a timer i think but i wanted to complete it before reset, you never know...
---
But when it comes to melting shields in the well, nova bomb doesn't event come close to one bar and blade barrage completely annihilates it
---
I'm running two pulses on my hunter that I'm building up right now to give myself a different challenge. Though one of them is GL for the multikill lols.
---
Good to hear I'm moving to PC in a couple of weeks and coming from PS4 all I saw were pulse rifles
---
Yeye, first you all want the D1 HC's back, then you get tired of it. I never played D1 and I don't give a shot about those weapons.
---
Some players wait for others to load and show their ghosts with colored projection (it shows color of your class). Really helpful and a quite cool rule of unspoken etiquette. If only those projections were not rare Tess drops...
---
Bungie said they were never bringing it back.
---
Just wish I had a raid team to even attempt to get either one 
---
Yeah they should stop adding new exotic hand cannons... right after they add Hawkmoon back
---
I really do miss my defender Titan.  
---
I'm genuinely asking this, but is it possible to change your element super right before boss fight ends and it still count if you complete it with that class equipped?
---
Well, basic strikes are a cakewalk, so limiting oneself to one class and exotic is not really necessary.
---
Ya it's whatever you are set to when the rewards drop.
---
I LOVE HANDCANNON!!
---
What if we get a gun that's a gigantic hand cannon meant for a huge creature that we use like a shotgun.
---
Wait, but you just said you Nova all the time?
---
Did the helmet stay on during the battle of Twilight Gap?
---
Can confirm
---
Source: Am friend with 75 clears
---
GSS. Gaurdian super slam.  Coming this summer on mercury 2019. Buy your passes now
---
It will stay forever. 
---
Accurate
---
really depends on the oponents you get, Me and 3 clan mates play regularly since the season started and pretty much every second match we get matched agains 4 stacks that run around with NF an DRB. We are at 1200 right now but we are already done with the recluse wins for example since friday
---
Wouldn't really change much, most people (on PC at least) use a shotgun / sniper as secondary and Hammerhead or Nade Launcher as Power.
---
Thanks for the quick answer my dude. 
---
Prove it
---
How to rely on aim assist 101
---
Can we get an exotic sword that takes special or dare I say kinetic ammo
---
Yeah, just a bunch of 3 hour long ‚Äúquests‚Äù
---
dear god...
---
Possible the other guy is in their fireteam, if you had to decide between helping a friend and a stranger, probably pick the friend.
---
Thank you.
---
This is great, guardian. 
---
Hey, pay attention to usernames :D
---
Sup bitch
---
I wish they would stop bringing back D1 exotics all together. The nostalgic feeling is nice but we've used those items already. We've PAID for this exotics already. Be creative. Make something new.

Ill die if they bring back uni remote

yeah fuck it. pandering to hand cannon lovers. that's why I'm moving away from destiny 2 for now. nothing new in game, exotics doesn't drop at all, didn't have a single drop for MONTHS , why even invest time in grind then? matchmaking is broken, so fun is lost in it. TD2 here I come.

In comp I prefer AoS. In comp most people lag and the perks from nf wont proc.

Have you played on a hunter with Spectral Blades in PvP?

The fuck? How xd

Yeah

Its kinda useless in pve

Surprised more people haven‚Äôt called me out. Go easy on me, I was angry typing üòú

The spawnpoints on this map...

*Laughs in bridge cheese*

Pls bungo no nerf

Luna and nf must be really bad on console cause we rarely  ever see it here on pc even in higher comp 
---
Titans have a melee ability called Shoulder Charge if they are sprinting and they go to melee they can shoulder charge you and that ik is a 1- hit
---
It would make it even better if the "bugs" twitched
---
I can‚Äôt beat the shit out of you without getting closer.
---
All Titans? shut up, I wanna be Shaxx too.
---
Season of the helmet! 
---
i thought the cheese spot doesn't work in solo
---
Nope.
---
Both are just objectively superior versions of 180 hand cannons with slight exceptions for build specifications.
---
Under optimal, they kill in 1 less shot, their perk can be abused to 2 shot players from full, to melt supers etc...  
---
It's a Hawkmoon, Malfeasence hybrid and it's disgusting.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Both need to be exotic.
---
They have a lowsodium subreddit too? 
---
Great idea! Would love to see some Shaxx plot and it would be awesome to bring back SRL. I would like to see it mostly PvE as well, but I think a Shaxx season would also be a great opportunity to balance Crucible. Personally, I enjoy Crucible and more lore behind it would only be a good thing.
---
It doesn't, you're going to need someone to do dps.
---
Looks awesome! Now if you want to stay in character, go play some gambit and get killed by large blockers.
---
Thematically correct. Facial hair relation incorrect. 
---
Hey! Mobs is for Minecraft. Ads is for Destiny
---
I actually tried to play with this armor but as you can see the recovery is shit so I had to switch 
---
It's low effort, cheap content. Why use resources to create new original weapon quests if they can just make the players grind AGAIN for the same weapon they've already earned in Destiny 1?
---
Almost nobody complains so they can rinse and repeat that philosophy without problems.
---
Go off king
---
Fun thing I have a bearded dragon I named Emperor Calus
---
Bungee we hear your outcry and understand you don‚Äôt want anymore hand cannons.
---
Community so can we not have any more
---
Bungee well yes but actually no
---

PvP wise the app is pointless, but you can grind out flashpoints, daily heroic missions, etc. on the go.
---
My current version has no moving parts, but I‚Äôm working on adding them in. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt she only appear during the strongest curse?
---
Yeah I know, we do have some cancer moments in this game and your suggestion would be the perfect way. 
---
One thing I don't get tho, if one subclass is boosted during a strike - why would you want to run any other? :P I mean... it's more damage lol. I understand activities like Savathung song where melee subclass is underpowered etc but still :D
---
ah damn, well i'm trying to solo the strike so thanks for the tip anyway.
---
Got it.
---
Warlords were enemies of the Iron Lords, so Saladin and Shaxx probably killed eachother a whole bunch of times and more
---
Yes please
---
Just showing you ive raided a lot lol
---
Well technically it's been 2 weeks. But I take it as a compliment nonetheless üòâ
---
OEM isn't worth shit anymore.
---
Hell there's no exotics worth a damn anymore. Everything is nerfed to ass.
---
I think bungie fails to understand that with nerfs should come buffs to other exotics. If everything gets a constant nerf, there's not even a point to using exotics anymore.
---
Love it
---
Use key on R! ANARCHY
---
it‚Äòs pretty much a oh shit button in qcq to use a shotgun, aos for the rest. I hope I can reach fabled, should be possible but very grindy
---
The infinite forest still hasn't been used in the way we all hoped. Maybe a season of Shaxx would be a chance to do so
---
only one man can wear this suit.  also, why dont we have an exotic double barrel shotgun?
---
Just watching him one shot Oryx with his Mountain Top, while yeling #THIS IS AMAZING!
---
He probably saw this during a day.
---
At a glance I thought that was a hot dog in his hand
---
nice job
---
My Thorn actually dropped at 666 when I got it.
---
This is true in the Reckoning too. Having all titans makes the bridge 10x more difficult :(
---
Those thrall have messed me up, thankfully my teammates were two teacher hunters with invis so we easily made it.
---
Good luck to anyone else.
---
If they would just embrace the fact that they release about 3 weeks of new content every season it may be for the best.  No more time gating, don't up the light level by that much.  Just release the new stuff and let us grind it at our own pace.  You will never meet the requirements of grindlords, no one can, it is impossible.  You are just pushing everyone else away from your game.  You don't do monthly subs so stop trying to keep players and focus more on releasing quality stuff to bring them back.
---
Red death üíÄ plz 
---
I stopped playing before even finishing Forsaken's Raid. Couldn't be arsed. I love the game, but some armor was made useless because of the new rolls system. Without giving all that beautiful unique armor from prior to forsaken love. 
---
Why did I spend so much hours grinding for cool gear &amp; shaders only for it to be useless..
---
*cries in Ikelos &amp; Solstice armor
---
I'd like to see something cool done with auto-rifles. I can't think of anything flashy they have going on for them right now. Pulse Rifles and Swords are ripe for awesome ideas too.
---
i've been meaning to try it out in invasion but im waiting until the last malfeasance step to do that.
---
So... A sniper rifle?
---
I know they have double and triple valor events,  cant remember if they do that for Glory?  Hope they do, because that will probably be my best chance LOL
---
Good luck on your comp grind man :) 
---
dude, every seen chibirobo?  he is a sniping machine
---
I kinda love that it's acknowledged how OP everyone is. Like normally the characters rely on us in these sorts of games as "the chosen one". But in this game, we're not the only badass. They all have achieved incredible things and conquered the impossible. It's not that Ikora or the Player are stronger, it's that they're just handling different tasks. 
---
Mostly
---
so you wanted to play gambit....
---
Im curious, how did you get the +3 head piece?
---
In my understanding/personal experience the heads come from the weekly bountys for each role. And it starts with the head pieces +1. If you do the same bounty a week later it will give you the head piece +2 and so on. But this is only the second week. So... HOW THE FUCK!
---
I'd much rather have new exotic weapons of pretty much any type rather than more hand cannons, most of which were already gotten in D1, where Bungie said they didn't want to bring over the D1 gear so there could be new equipment to use and adventures to be had. But I guess what they meant was "we want you to keep paying us to get shit you already had".
---
Yeah I got the request man, I'll be on tonight.
---
üëè  üëè
---
It either tracks or doesnt. 50 - 50
---
*‚ÄúIf everything seems under control, you're not going fast enough.‚Äù*
---
B-)
---
I hope she gets a season that redeems her and maybe Commander Zavala as well; maybe the Season of the Vanguard? She was correct in calling Zavala a coward, but she did little herself to aid us in avenging Cayde and so showed the same cowardice herself. She‚Äôs pretty awesome up until the beginning of Forsaken, otherwise (though I‚Äôm not a fan of her sort of bland voice acting).
---
We could also get Cayde‚Äôs replacement during that season, as well as PvE-oriented activities to balance out the Season of the Crucible proposed in this post. We could even have old raids from D1 resurrected (having never played D1, I would love to play the Vault of Glass and such).
---
Not element. I just make them match in other ways. Take my iron banner gear for example. 2 rocket scavengers, 1 reserves, 1 taken armaments mod, and 4 grenade mods. Add a pair of Orpheus riggs and cluster bad omens to the mix on a taken strike with grenadier and void burn, and you will shit yourself. Playing gambit id pick up 4 or 5 rockets at a time. Need more? Chuck a grenade. Shoot some rockets. You can hold 7 rockets anyway. Out of grenades? Wait 8 seconds (grenadier modifier, 30ish otherwise). Too long? Shoot a tether, riggs give your abilities back, so you can chuck another grenade. Add melchdbdjdbdiidized bramble, and you have pretty neat armor. 
---
Titans have little use in Scourge I can tell you that
---
Many people believe that the game drops better stuff if you take a break. Very doubtful, you just got lucky.
---
That would be awesome.
---
Gonna have to ask you to edit that segment about the loot system to remove the homosexuality comment. If it isn't removed within the next half hour, your post is getting removed.
---
how he broke that horn?
---
Ok libtard
---
Well it's not like they're not talking to each other. They're just doing their own thing.
---
I've done 4 clears ever... I got 1KV off the first one, though!
---
Specially when you are as ugly as me. 
---
Same here, got 6 of 8 completed.  
---
I don't remember what I look like, and I transferred my character from d1 ü§îü§®
---
I got the shader!!! 
---
Got a pulse off tier 2 myself. It's real
---
*spicy bois
---
Shaxx has been my favorite since destiny 1, I feel like this idea is **AMAZING!** 
---
First time completing the raid last night, and RNGsus blessed me with this wonderful work of art. 
---
Yeah, I've posted this list a few times now, and each time a lot of the responses are that this is because people love hand cannons in destiny so I get it. I just wish the rest is not forgotten, I am a pulse main myself, I hate how clunky and slow hand cannons are. 
---
Gotta be the titan, even know I use my hunter the most there nothing like running around when non stop death from above kills, not to mention the hammers. 
---
Supposedly it's next in the rotating game mode spot.
---
&gt; Read the FAQ before posting your questions 
---
Yeah, they should be done...riiiiiight after they reintroduce Hawkmoon.
---
snitch
---
Unfortunately the queen can't be visited anymore, no. You also missed a bow from the Valentine's event as well as a couple cosmetics, but other than that anything else can be acquired.
---
Claymore isn‚Äôt out of reach, you can still complete the quest. The only weapon/armor i can think of is the dawning set and avalanche machine gun. 
---
Those are Warlock supers. The ray of blue Lightning are Chaos‚Äô Reach, and the purple giant ball are Nova Bomb. Chaos Reach is a deadly super, if directed correctly, it could kill everyone. Nova Bomb is much more stronger and powerful, you can see in the video. This is the first video i ever saw a super cancelling one another, and killing the enemy caster.
---
Haha never forget curse of Osiris launch
---
SEASON OF THE AMAZING!! 
---
Yep as long as they complete it with other clan members everyone in the clan will get the engram. Raids can definitely be all night events. They have some aspects of an mmo but mostly group mechanics that take coordination. 
---
I don't exactly understand what an account recovery is in relationship to paying for a group to carry you to something but the latter is fine. If you choose to spend your hard earned cash on a gun in a video game, more power to you. 
---
That one guy in your group that vapes and never mutes ::SHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO:: 
---
Ears bleeding everyone in unison "can you fucking not"
---
Vaper: "Is it really that loud?" - Every 5 minutes.
---
Much obliged. Imma check there
---
Account recovery is where someone else takes your account and plays for you
---
My favorite part of Destiny is the crucible, always has been. I think it is the definition of perfect PvP. So if they had a season dedicated to Shaxx, I'd actually cry. 
---
Warlocks have a lot of utility and imo nova warp is ode fun with its neutral game. 
---
I've been playing more PvP lately and finally managed to get some super cool crucible medals. Plus dialogue for getting 20 kills in one life (thanks Le Monarque). I could not support this idea more. I always need more Shaxx. 
---
I've never actually played SRL but I heard people liked it so I made this poster. If you have any other Destiny themed posters or whatever you would think might be cool, let me know. I'm happy with how this turned out!
---
Warp is fun but i love nuking people with slovabomb
---
Aw, man. Alright. I just have foresaken, not the annual pass, so I guess I can't get it. Shame though, it looks cool. 
---
Cluster bomb still works, but Prospector and other grenade launchers work better, lots of people have stuck with tickets just because they're used to it though.
---
This reminds me of Geoff from achievement hunter
---
Ah OK makes sense. I thought it was like reaping inactive accounts or something much more complicated. 
---
Oh, ty. You know if there's differences in damage between the archetypes as well (Excluding cluster damage)
---
Tiggered. Jumped into an LFG group three days after release and a dude in full sentry gear assigned me to sentry. Fr??
---
It‚Äôs a being made of pure darkness first it [Redacted] your neck then it CRONCHES ur ghost. 
---
Kind of hard to say Destiny 1 has terrible view distance and low-res textures considering it was a huge visual benchmark for a long time, but I guess that's just opinion
---
AAAG is good but I prefer a bite of the Fox with opening, snapshot, flared mag, range mw 
---
560 isnt a carry. 550-560 is the minimum to be able to kill riven for the average player
---
Wow grenade launchers that good now?
---
Nah, Handcannons are boss af
---
I'm better than most in the crucible because I've been playing since day 1. If you enjoy winning, you should stick to the game you enjoy winning at the most :) 
---
You‚Äôre not wrong with their being appeal for this kind of thing because of the ridiculous nature of the weapons but I mean it made getting Luna‚Äôs for myself that much more meaningful because i was able to beat dozens of NF‚Äôs and Luna‚Äôs with my trust and my teammates to finally work my way to such a place. 
---
Jesus mate, calm down. I never made this post to gloat about my bow skills; I made it to just show some funny bullshit where I got my last kill due to Le Monarque's poison Damage. You literally have no reason to get pissy other than the fact you need to complain about SOMETHING. 
---
If the lore is headed the way I think it is from reading the cards "Seasons of the Vanguard" would be incredible, covering Shaxx, Ikora and ~~Vuvuzela~~ Zavala. It could have a final send off to Cayde where parts of his memory are stored in the Infinite Forest (since he was trapped in the Vex teleporter) and we re-live some of his famous moments. 
---
The Game Theorists did a theory of how most of dances in Fortnite AND Destiny can't really be sued for. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Db-tuTCsoWU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Db-tuTCsoWU)
---
Honestly they could make it an. In game lfg area 
---
I did too but the second key gave me the shittiest roll on a pulse I've ever seen to make up for it. To say the least the guy w/ twenty clears hated me so much. I hope all you others out there get yours!
---
I didn't even consider risk runner, that's a smart option.
---
Check out Charlie Company 776 on the 100.io app and Spirit of 76 Bungie Clan.  Both are tied together and most are older players.  Lots of evening game sessions to sign up for but you need to be quick.  
---
I want Trespasser back from D1, Pocket Infinity, Super Good Advice, Bad Juju, the class specific ones would be cool too with a replacement for Ace of Spades since you know....things. 
---
Pity me lol
---
Show raid report, and learn something new then. Melting point, bannershield and hammers are not even close to required in any raid lmao. MP is required MAYBE in some 2mans/3mans, but usually you run Warlocks in 2 mans any way so not really. 
---
A dance in the void. 
---
Season of the Warlord when?
---
Needs more complaints about Spectral Blades
---
In defense of Destiny both D1 and D1 none of our vanilla commons looked and felt like the exotics.
---
Season of the Warlord
---
Don't let this distract you from the fact that whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war withe cabal on Mars.
---
Yeah but legendaries sure did
---
Did you run the cut-scene-quest 3 times, or did you buy the invite from Xur 3 times? I didn't think of trying either of those
---
That cant be right. Really?
---
‚ÄúYou sure have gotten good at killing guardians... maybe we should take a break‚Äù
---
True legendaries were mostly lackluster in appearnce in both vanilla, especially D1. However unlike anthem our exotics at least look and feel unique. 
---
Screw this game your "destiny" is already decided before you even play which is crap.
---
I am definitely guilty of abusing Jotunn in every game mode since I got it a month ago. The gun is just amazing visually, sounds amazing and is hella strong. 
---
Instead of one dickhead in your team, you had four. It's easy math, Guardian.
---
Hey! Super mods are useful outside the crucible too!
---
Same, on the bright side I hadn't done the LW quest, so I got them both complete at once
---
No it does not increase ur ttk at all, useless perk 
---
Laughs in Red Dead 2
---
It allows you to aim for the chest and still get optimal TTK when the recoil takes your reticle to head. If you don't normally hit all headshots, it can be helpful for decreasing TTK.
---
I'm dreading / excited / desperate for Hawkmoon to come back. Every other hand cannons returned. What about my favourite. 
---
Season of the Queenbanger
---
"sweaty"  
---
Just pick everything void and play as you want.
---
Make it the chasm of whispers, easy 1-attempt strike.
---
Stories like this make me wish there was a mercy rule of some sort. Like, you have a 1% chance to get it each completion, but complete it 25 times and you are guaranteed it.
---
As someone who got it on my first run I feel like you guys are being straight cheated.
---
Has nobody gotten this until now I'm confused because I already have this 
---
But it should still be a heavy
---
For an old game? Hell yeah it was beautiful
---
If you can't find a clan to get into PM me and I will take you on.  We didn't max out clan rank last season because a lot of them have moved on.  If you dont mind playing solo(which you already are) and just want some extra loot each week via clan engrams from nightfall, gambit and crucible then we might be a good fit.  If you are looking for raid opportunities and people to do stuff with everynight you might want another clan.  I only play 2 nights a week but I know at least one of my friends will be on then so its fine for me.  we are Xbox but clans dont matter for that as far as getting the engram.
---
Fun fact: Lord Shaxx is short for warlord because he used to be one
---
i guess.. didnt play D1 (cries in pc)
---
I had this for months 
---
Good thing they are good at teaching.
---
Interesting, especially the last part
---
we all know what he did in twilight gap, he was punching stuff. 
---
The creators of the Last Word now proudly present their newest rifle, the Last Sentence. 
---
Yo man, don‚Äôt discredit yourselves. There‚Äôs always someone better and someone worse than you out there. As long as you‚Äôre having fun doing what you love (and judging by the clips, you are) then that‚Äôs all that matters. Phenomenal video IMO, I‚Äôve honestly been looking to do the same for my PS4 clan, but admittedly don‚Äôt know where to start. Props tho man, definitely dope :)
---
Literally going Vanguard for enhancement cores. It be like that sometimes.
---
Yes. It's called The Reckoning. It is how you get the new armor sets for Gambit prime.
---
Don't rush into fights it's most of the time pointless if you don't feel comfortable in crucible, don't be afraid to use meta guns to get kills, don't be afraid to step back and run away from fight for a brief moment, depending on the super you are using - just use it instead of waiting for that perfect moment... Just a few tips that came to my mind and helped me to get my Crucible KD into positive numbers within like a week or so, don't give up guardian, Shaxx will be proud
---
So you only have small games? 
---
I'll get there soon I'm at 53%
---
Weirdly I found going to fast also fucks this up, when it finally worked for me I actually waited half a second when getting to each lever before pulling. For some reason the levers weren't registering as being all the way down by the time I got to the next one it was real weird 
---
The hero we need but don't deserve.
---
I love running bridge with a dawnblade and/or Nightstalker, makes it 10x easier as long as everyone remembers to watch for snipers!
---
Oh damn. Well atkeast i have the next step. Good for me : a whole pve quest. Ok i still got the malefes...idk. gambit exo handcannon. Yall know which one. And last word. But i just made Thorn. Whenevwr i am in this strike again...imma quit it out.
---
Why so the gun pointing at its head?
---
SEASON OF THE CRUCIBLE 
---
This is it chief üòÇ
---
This is exactly what I thought when I saw the original version of this
---
But Shaxx
---
Please no to Twilight Gap.
---
Gimme a mission where youre travel in with the Red Jacks in securing new Crucible maps but you discover some crazy shit. Like a graveyard of people or Risen, a new Hive creature, or in attempting to move into enemy territory, you discover Awoken refugees behind enemy lines and help them get to the city.
---
I mean it should definitely be PvP focused... considering we haven‚Äôt received any pvp content since forsaken, and for one week in February...
---
go to the tangled shore to do the quest.
---
Okay, thanks!
---
I got to the point where i actually used the talisman during the final quest to get to bow, but had to quit as i wasnt a high enough light level. I was wondering if because i left the quest if the talisman is still 'active' so to speak
---
It‚Äôs the recluse I‚Äôm guessing from the colors and rough shape
---
Clusters didn‚Äôt get nerfed Bungie moved the damage to the initial rocket blast
---
It requires any Echo (or Echo Dot) device to work it, but here's the silliest shit:
---
You don't need it. You can do all of the ghost stuff on an Echo and the sound is far better.
---
rats are 10/10
---
You take that photo from a moving car? It's near impossible to figure out what it is.
---
Those are the symbols of the nine. They are universally used for all of the nine stuff 
---
I‚Äôm sorry mah dude
---
Queenbreaker is pretty good.
---
The choice isn't Vanguard or Drifter. The Vanguard hasn't moved against him, just Aunor. Shaxx is on the side that makes Guardians stronger, I think I know the side.
---
Seems like they shit on you the more you play.  I play the most out of me and two friends who play, yet I get the fewest exotics and they're mostly duplicates when they do drop.
---
Whatever Bungie has said publicly about exotics, and what happens behind the scenes, are two wildly different situations.  There's also those people who don't play for 1-2 months and then get showered in exotics the day they come back.
---
Shaxx doesn't care about strength. He cares about the people.
---
I'm sorry but no hand cannon should be better than lunas/nf, people spent months grinding for those guns. Months. To make a freebie exotic hand cannon better than them would be a giant slap in the face.
---
I play on Xbox one
