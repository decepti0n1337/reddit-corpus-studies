This is the piece I finished recently for Myelin Games depicting Toland and the Bad Juju. I also got a chance to expand on my dark armor set I'm making for each class that my chat has lovingly named "Nevermore". Having done the titan's first with my Dredgen Yor piece, and now the warlock's with Toland, I'll have to find an excuse to make the Hunter's version. If you'd like to watch the speed painting you can do so here:

Meh could’ve been further off

Exos are completely self aware AIs created originally by the Clovis Bray Corporation during the golden age. They were quickly accepted by society as ‘people’. In short, not really like what you’re suggesting.
---
Yep. About 100 mats an hour. Just picked up my 1800 mats this morning
---
Once you get one. You unlock it in collections. If you go into your collections tab. Can get as many as you want out. Hope that helps.
---
no explosive pyre never came back sadly, what we have is "Solar ability kills generate sunspots"
---
*granted what they DON'T tell you is that Khepri's Horn, burn damage from Polaris and I think from Prospector can also proc this*
---
2 3 4 and 6 dont need anything honestly, theyre do what theyre meant to do and id argue lupi does it damn well, 1,8 and 7 need some touch ups for sure though especially feedback and wormgod bc theyre essentially useless compared to hunters liars handshake
---
let me actually check
---
out of 25 9-10 are great 
---
7 are ok and that leaves 9-8 as bad (buffwinterssoitisn'tauselessexotic)
---
I started up destiny yesterday and I'm at like 350 light or something. What did I miss?! Haha. I thought I could get a quest that bumped me to 6xx but the robot didn't have the invitation quest for me. I have the $99 version of the game so I'm assuming I have the season pass.
---
Looks kinda like Lord Zedd from Power Rangers
---
i was in this game, im still at a loss

Go into the flair section of the collections and if you go to shaders and look through them you should be able to claim more at the cost of legendary shards or glimmer

Flared magwell, greatly increases reload and slightly increases stability
---
Why this true?
---
Ah you too are a man of culture
---
Praise the sun!
---
exactly i actually found out about wormgod needing that buff while doing testing to see if i can replace hunter one two punch (spoiler can't because 4 second duration both warlocks and titans) but bottom tree striker can oneshot greg
---
also lupi creates more orbs but titans aren't really the orb class and alpha lupi's heal is outclassed by one eyed
---
Awesome, thanks guys!
---
Didnt want to sleep anyway
---
~~wait what prospecotor is arc anyways cool how did i do this oh is see i missclicked~~
---
Already have toster and now so now I'm just "curated plz?" I need that fucking shader gdi
---
Dude I feel ya. I'd grind for Recluse over this man... Like it can be frustrating but Recluse is easily (ish) obtainable in a season... This damn thing took me three seasons
---
*burn damage from Prospector, haven't really tested it myself since hardly anything survives the explosion*
---
I’m sorry but I wish there was a better way you could have done this poll. Like maybe have people just number the destinations and then add all their values up or something. That would probably be a more vague result than what you’re looking for but I just spent like 5 minutes trying to track which ones I had and hadn’t used lol
---
Trench will be more often used than surrounded and I personally would go with trench

Copy, paste, more money please.

Would be great if eris was the vendor/npc for the main part of the moon and then later in the expansion we unlock a new area and discover saint 14 who becomes the second NPC. Similar to how we got spider in the tangled shore and petra in the dreaming city. I think he may warrant his own dlc though since he's such a legendary figure in the lore.
---
"I'm not early, everyone else is late!"
---
I have/had a clan and they seemed cool but I’m a bit bad with my social skills. It’s more that I’m looking for a few people that I can become comfortable enough to actually talk to (I usually never use a headset but I plan to buy one if this post succeeds in finding anyone) and play with as a group (I’m usually not a fan of group settings because people make me a bit uncomfortable)
---
Everybody knows it’s RNG based, you can’t fool us!
---
fair enough. are you on the spectrum by any chance?
---
Astrocyte apes
---
All  the silver only items are slowly rotating in(except bundles), its a buy it now or wait for dust drop
---
Kill who you're dueling and get some health back. If not then retreat and recover.
---
Now that is a cool shot and all but the real question is how much damage was that, how much of the health bar was sent into the shadow realm?
---
I was never much into doing the holiday stuff in Destiny, picked the mission up by accident and the log was full already so it shipped it to my mailbox. been in there ever since and I just work around it.
---
That is insanely ingenious, I wish I could have regular success in Reckoning

Side note, what kinetic HC was that?

All of those sets are a fiction of Calus' making.  They also say the we kill our own Ghost, Toland, and Variks, and that Calus kills us at the end of all things.
---
I still have his ascendant Artichoke
---
I realized my typo later on.  I meant arc as stated in another comment.
---
Why use shards when everything else out classes it? 
---
Gonna do boss dps? Use celestial nighthawk since the raw damage is intense and you get 30% back if it kills
---
Add clearance? Use orpheus rigs since you get more super energy back and shards are inconsistent. 
---
Shard are only viable in mayhem and that's it, in every other activity it's just 
---
"why bother? ____ is better."
---
I saw, but didn’t feel like deleting this
---
Do Werner bounties
---
5 resets in a season is a pain unless you play as much as you can during double and triple valor, like this week.
---
I have been playing nonstop since d2 came out and now that season of Opulence is hear the game can only get better. I wish that you will give the game a second chance. Especially when it’s free in September they are really trying to make the game better.
---
The app is great, isn’t it?
---
How do I check this? I did menagerie for the first time earlier today and didn't see I could check the score
---
the bosses of the raid are coming back for the moon expansion
---
Bawllssss
---
F
---
Rose is good. If you have Crimson, try that. If you’re low light, I wouldn’t try in IB.
---
Were you trying to kill her or delete her entire existence
---
What would be the best game mode for me then?
---
Forges: Basketball with guns
---
Is that supposed to be alot
---
Actually it is..
---
That’s not even a lot
---
Half the eyes will exist
---
Oh so just the bosses. Pretty cool.
---
Don’t worry I had 26 clears before getting tarabah( I did the raid every week since it came out on all character and got it this week)
---
You have to do both bosses. They alternate each week.
---
Sometimes I actually can't see the zone flags, like they're not there at all and I can't cap anything.  
---
I wish I was making a joke, but I'm not, this has actually happened to me 2 or 3 times.
---
Crest of Alpha Lupi:  Generates an additional Orb of Light for allies anytime one would be generated by the wearer.
---
(i.e. Masterworked weapons would still only generate one orb for the user but allies would have 2 orbs appear.  Similar to how you can't use Orbs generated from your own supers.)
---
The one guy messed it up. Smh.
---
Ok but I did one of them flawlessly then I did it again and died and it reset, that's my problem
---
The other guy’s trolling. D2 is in a really good state rn, the expansion after Warmind (Forsaken) set the game back on track. 
---
Next season the base game and its first 2 DLCs will become free, along with specific forsaken content, and all destinations will be available apart from the new moon patrol area.
---
In last Wish the encounters are as follow
---
The Great Kalli
---
Sriracha sauce
---
Quasimodo
---
Chastity Belt
---
Bukkake
---
Quickplay, while sweats are in IB.
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Maybe try Rumble or just Quick Play
---
Oh. Thank you for all your help!
---
Thank you!
---
Yeah, as a warlock main I admit oem is kinda strange how it was accepted, and nova warp was also op, but hunters can out damage every class with celestial, and they have spectral blades. But yet they need a shit ton of buffs
---
Oh well, I guess i have to buy it then. Thanks
---
:D
---
Nice one mate. I'm actually about to finish the quest as well. Currently need one bounty and my final reset
---
Now that is a real monster
---
Okay, so its basically Forsaken 40$ + all the other stuff "for free". Guess I have to pay 40 bucks then.
---
Thanks man
---
I can hear this picture
---
Funny because it’s true
---
I want the loot from the iron banner challenges but I only have a 348 light level so I just run around capping points since I do no damage.
---
Yeah I spent most of the time working on that helmet lol
---
Buy the rest of the game and it won't be a problem
---
Gotta break even...
---
That must just be for pc
---
Curated raid weapons are also a guaranteed Bergusian Night.
---
Source: have gotten two in... 3 or 4 runs. I’m sorry.
---
I’m one reset away. Thankfully it’s double valor. And luckily comp isn’t as cancerous to me as quickplay. Plus I hate control so fuck Iron Banner lol
---
Holy shit that's cool!

Who is the artwork by if you don't mind me asking?

Lord of wolves is not hear cuz it's getting nerfed soon.
---
Yeah ward of dawn on the Minotaur can protect you if you are in the back I heard have not tested it yet so don't quote me and do your homework
---
Maybe if you put it into wish wall it's wish 15. A stretch but I'm just throwing it out there
---
Get revoker that shit is so fun to just mess with, taking shots you wouldn't normally take because of ammo, just taking risky mid-air shots
---
Think about how satisfying it'll be to start clearing it though! I'd probably start with strikes, Nessus, and maybe crucible? If you're brave. Then that just leaves the tower left :) I'm leaving out Gambit personally haha.
---
I had much better luck in Rumble with that step, but as with all things ymmv
---
I don't think light level has anything at all to do with 3 hits in a super doing nothing.
---
But blinding nades have a blast radius of almost nothing.
---
I'm 26, you invalid.

Blind well was fixed last week. I used it to finish up my wendigo bounty.

im sorry to hear that seeing as to how i have one last wish completion and a 1k voices

Yeah thats probably what I will do.

I just got the ace of spades. Same scale as this one. Feels like it’s made of metal or very heavy plastic. Magnetic parts to connect to the stand. Very good quality imo.
---
Thank you for understanding. Finally got lucky and had no one show up so I could finish it myself.  I really think people were deliberately finishing the boss before i could activate the heroic part.
---
I always loved the cloak
---
Boy, let me tell you lol I mean, gosh. Man, you know, I sure do love drawing "Calus" sooooooo much!
---
What is loW????

I do indeed. I've got many prints available on my website gammatrap.com and I'll have these up there soon

Ah the balding is just commencing bro gotta get those pills to stop it.

Let's hope it's soon then :)

Oh boy I might end up checking it out lol
---
Dead ass forgot this was a gun
---
Lord of Wolves
---
It is up to you. Pvp is not the main focus of this game, it's mostly quest fodder or an extra activity you do for fun and do not take seriously. You don't have to do pvp if you don't want to. 
---
Bear in mind, there is a week long special pvp mode called iron  banner right now where power level advantages are in effect. Normal crucible does not have power level advantages enabled.
---
Must smell like jellyfish death

Actually it clearly states that Level Advantages are Disabled.
---
Haven't played since Warmind, but I had that itch to play again. Iron Banner has always been tons of fun (with the best looking armor). I'm saving up to get Forsaken so hopefully I won't be a burden for much longer. Until then, if you see a level 30 hiding behind you shooting out tethers go easy on 'em!
---
So the tarrable
---
Thank you for clearing it up, I was looking at iron banner and it recommended power level of 500 so I’ll stay away from that for now. 
---
I’ve got a lot of clearing up to do in pve so I’ll stick with that.
---
same honestly that one and meyrin are the ones i am still missing(and bergusian night but i don‘t think i have the luck for that)
---
I got mine on my 51st run
---
I’m sorry man:(
---
Rule 6 - - No advertising.
---
ill edit, my apologies
---
Halloween mask
---
How is someone able to do this? This seems like an external mod... Saw someone with raul's face on his helmet.
---
This makes me think that in PVE, to fix Titans isn't to buff them, but to give them utility in a damage suppression phase, as opposed to a regular damage phase.
---
Turned in 245 tokens and didn't get a single armor piece. Did they change something with that?
---
Don't get me started with Beloved
---
It depends if you want to be caught up and have weapons and experience then get foresaken now. But if you don’t care about being behind and not having many op weapons than wait
---
pretty sure if a weapon has a shader that is not already in your collections and you dismantle it it's a 100% drop....like pretty sure bungie has actually said that
---
I don’t mind about the weapons. I still wreck in crucible quickplay with Better Devils and the good old Coldheart exotic. Honestly just trying to get my power level up tbh
---
hah... this is great.
---
It take 4 shots from golden gun to kill a person without it! I've recently switched to quiver and tethers though, super denial and easy team assists goes alot further than the 1 kill.
---
Its subjective, if you're a good player, you'll sit and cap something regardless. Already lost track of the times people will ignore/run past capping point C as the enemy slowly cap A (while they have B), which immediately locks them all in the enemy favour. The better play would have been prevent the lockdown rather than throw yourself at the enemy, no matter how good you think you are.
---
yeah i heard the same but im not going to get anything that requires more than 5 games of crucible. im no where close in skill as the people i get matched with so i end up losing and in comp id get my shit pushed all the way through.
---
No. Only comp gives extra progress
---
Outbreak is by far the easiest 'good' new exotic- can be obtained in 1-2 hours of play (less with a legit fireteam). Then I'd focus menagerie and related play.
---
lol all my dust was funneled into tributes. Im fine with it.
---
Bro use an alt character that hasn’t done any armor quest steps at all to redeem tokens to farm good weapons only since armor wont be in the loot pool for that character
---
U mean u saved the hardest for last? Besta luck bud
---
I try to show mercy 
---
But i cant talk for my friends
---
Yeah do this because by the time you’ll be setup for PvP after all the PvE stuff when shadowkeep drops bungie has said they want to rework the foundation of PvP since they know it is flawed in a lot of aspects
---
Which game mode were you playing?
---
I assume you created a frequency at this point? This won't correspond to the one you need, delete the current one from your inventory, but do not create a new one, as you don't need one for this quest step
---
[*Cue the intro music*](https://youtu.be/pAgnJDJN4VA)
---
Best bet is to do it in quick play, if you run comp you run the risk of getting survival and countdown and that's a waste of time. Just camp heavy and def use fighting lion. Stay with teammates to try and get lots of 1 shots, a Luna well or rally barricade help a ton too
---
no, use lot of armor perks, try to get heavy some times, try prospector, fightimg lion and then go to work... i did it like that too. maybe get some friends to help you, then its easy
---
Aw, I hope that’s not true... thanks for answering though! :)
---
You can't get the chest more than once now
---
They patched that. You can now only get one chalice reward per run.
---
Just google recipes for the chalice if you're needing help with that.
---
F@ck! But thx for the help
---
Thx
---
Underrated comment. For if i had an award, I’ll give it to this man right here
---
Wait did I read that wrong or can it roll with kill clip and also rampage?
---
Self-oof
---
Thanks you!
---
Im pretty sure that the engram light is from etsy.com. Its USB powered and you can change the colours so it can be a common, rare, legendary or exotic engram.
---
Holy mother of tether
---
I need to know this aswell! I have the base game with no dlc and I can buy the “Forsaken Annual Pass” for $21 on xbox store or I can buy “The Destiny 2: Forsaken - Complete Collection” for $40 but I already have the base game so....
---
It can roll with killclip and rampage, meaning for a 2 tap in crucible. Transfiguration ( the last Wish scout) can do the same.
---
Fuck I remember getting destroyed by this gun when I was trying to get heavy to get mountaintop kills... I need it now to also kill people getting mountain top kills...
---
You’re probably thinking of Mithrax tbh. A fallen guardian is a great concept tho :)
---
So some people are farming for the refurbished shader? I had no idea.
---
Around 3 hours, this is one of my more detailed ones :)
---
Dunno what system you're playing on, lol
---
It looks cool but it's really not needed. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Just shoot it on the floor in between them all and it tethers everything anyway.
---
That’s a great idea actually :)))
---
All the ones I found on Etsy were battery powered sadly. Thanks though.
---
come back later, there shouldn't be problems switching between servers but sometimes it bugs out and all you can do is try again later
---
Ok that's quite a list. Thanks for taking the time. Will look into them after work. Cheers!
---
I still haven’t done forsaken on my warlock, and probably never will.
---
if this is bait its certainly good bait
---
Who is this odynom?
---
it’s truth now either way lol
---
Yes!
---
It depends on the shaders too.  Sometimes you have to mix and match shaders/armor to get a decent look.
---
I think it’s called ‘eldritch effect’ I’m not sure tho.
---
Watching the r/RaidSecrets discord pick that apart and try to crack codes was wild. Some smart fuckers play this game.
---
Idk, the chest pieces are great along with the boots and Gauntlets, the helmet is mainly the issue for me. I guess it’s a good thing most of my favorite exotics are helms.
---
Everyone who rips on raidsecrets and their wish 15 hunters be like "I'm never gonna find anything meaningful in this game so I better make fun of the ones who are trying."  Smdh
---
Form over function. I don’t care if the armor is bad, if it looks good, you better believe I’m using it
---
This is super helpful for anyone struggling with the sparrow race in Scourge of the Past!
---
It’s a good gun.  Never left my inventory during that season.  
---
Probably the best overall pinnacle weapon that isn’t recluse(which I could care less about).

I’m not great at PvP in destiny, average k/d or efficiency or whatever is like 1.5 or around there. 3 games in a row yesterday, only myself and one other person on my team were positive, in all 3 matches. The worst offender had a .2. How do you even get a .2 and keep playing? How is that balanced matchmaking? Am I missing something??
---
Thank you!!
---
Got 1K after they upped the dropped rate on around completion 35. 
---
Got Tarrabah last night after 7 which is definitely nice. 
---
After 21 clears of Scourge (and yes, I realize it isn’t that many compared to many people going for it), I have not gotten a trench barrel shotgun, the sparrow or the anarchy. I wouldn’t complain at this point if it was just one or two of those missing but all three... Oh well.
---
Yeh always 2 of 1 and 1 of the other and u can take a pen key to any pen lock and vice versa
---
Celestial Nighthawk changes it to the Last Word model instead of the Eyasluna model.

Don't forget 1k and truth

Play as well as you can so hopefully they time out. Get those bans!

---
Yeah I passed on Mountain Top.
---
I read the quest steps, and instantly deleted the quest when I got home that day. 
---
Who's to say they won't just nerf it like Luna's
---
lol i'll keep that in mind
---
I see your point but i own the recluse too and for the example, in the CoS raid i recently took it out of my loadout for the loaded question. Its not the end all be all in pve content. The recluse’s usability is severely lacking in any encounter where you need range. Im on console so that may be diff for pc, but u cannot even try for far  away targets with the recluse. 
---
There arent really any viable legendary smgs that are commonly used in todays meta aside the recluse. And that is to be expected due to it being a pinnacle weapon where you have to earn it. Everyone separates destiny the game into pve and pvp content. But the bottom line is, the recluse is earned in a pvp gamemode but isnt locked to only be used in that mode. 
---
Like someone else said on this thread, a gun like LoW is going to get much more attention as it is so much more game breaking than the recluse is
---
The thing is, they use macros and bots to keep themselves in. The last game I played, there was 1 (of 2) afker that made it so that he left constantly walk left and forward... But that put him in a pit. So he would keep getting auto revived and repeat the process
---
They are doing back end work to prepare for it currently but it's not yet live. May just be seeing some of the behind the scenes stuff they are preparing.
---
I did not know that... thanks!
---
Its not that hard to get even at 750, the only one i didnt finish last night was the super kill one(kept getting shot out of GG)
---
If it bothers you that much just get a 730 piece out of collections and put yourself at 747 with a 730 piece.
---
This really isn't rocket science. Its not hard to lower your level in this game.
---
Time for punch
---
Im a warlock main brotha!! But i admit that titan sentinal bottom tree with those purple exotic arms is a blast to play as
---
Oh okay thank you, so I have to buy the Complete Collection?
---
I think in September there is a thing called new light whereby the base game and curse of Osiris &amp; Warmind will be completely free
---
There isn't really a defined godroll, just number of perks that excell at certain activities and it's up to you to dedide what suits you the best.
---
I gotta admit it is fun
---
It pisses me off that each tab isn't in it's own color
---
Aren't they already? I played through both storylines. Is there more to them besides story and items?
---
Forsaken is worth 15 bucks if you are a fan of the franchise. This is because it is a comet expansion, taken king sized and brought not only large content but large changes to the core economy and operations of the game.
---
Unfortunately you need Osiris and Warmind to get forsaken, this will be less of a problem when the former two dlcs become free in September
---
I think it was like a month ago when Season of Opulence started, but anyone that owns the base game was given CoO and Warmind. Forsaken is $39.99, and comes with the Forsaken Annual Pass for no extra charge, so that's your best price. The bundle is called "Forsaken Complete Collection". You can't play the Forsaken Annual Pass without having Forsaken, so don't get the $15 one, that's only for players that already own Forsaken.
---
You don't need Forsaken to play Shadowkeep, and Shadowkeep has it's own Annual pass.
---
Hope that clears up all your questions!
---
Yeahh, it would’ve
---
The annual pass is a set of 3 small content additions to the destiny universe, the forsaken annual pass requires the purchase of all 3 content blocks for one price. However the upcoming rumoured annual pass has been rumoured to have optional purchases and not all content blocks have to be purchase
---
U forgot about the one eyed mask
---
Don't get what I'm looking for. Looks like an average IB match. It's not too one sided, there's no mercy ruling, it timed out. Yeah you got had on kills but thats life without Sbmm. Nowt you can do about that except find yourself a stack to roll with. I've given up trying at pvp in destiny. Used to rock a 1.7 kd with sbmm, loved scouts and ARs. But all that's gone now, I'm too old to run around shotgunning. Tho I'm starting to like sniping. I jus participate with friends when I have to play. If I were on xb I'd add you let you roll with us.
---
If there is a bundle for Osiris, warmind, forsaken and the annual pass for 15 bucks that is worth it IMO
---
A majority of the population is level 50, with LL somewhere between 600-700, so I think the level 30 strikes are pretty underpopulated at the moment.
---
Crazy cause I’m just a couple light levels over you and got into one no problem yesterday
---
So campaign my way to 50 probably? And then no issue?
---
I only tried twice, both times it sent me alone. Might just campaign to 50 and then shouldn't even be an issue
---
Not really, if you have played the story then are you certain you have bought them?
---
So initially I would lower my power level to get into empty strikes just to grind guns. As I was doing this I realized the people I matched with were actually excited to have someone to run with. Now I do my weeklies in the 300 play list just to help out. I'm also on Xbox if ya wanna run some time
---
I've been grinding for that roll since BA dropped and can't get it to drop.  I gave up about a month ago..  :(
---
Congrats though guardian.
---
Both DLCs were very poor in the context of destiny

The way I'm parsing it is, if you have a full set of armor, you can transfer it to the gunsmith.  
---
If you have a full set in the collections, you can retrieve it and make it 2.0.  
---
If this is not at all what it is, someone please correct me. I don't want any more misinfo going on.

Have you raided? "10+ clears, will raid report" is the scariest most toxic LFG post ever because if you have 9 clears and can't find a team you risk getting shot and your entire family hunted down for not ignoring their post and waiting another 30 mins. While nothing is on the level of gjallarhorn in terms of power I don't think people are any less picky about fire teams. It switches to whatever the meta is, nowadays it's prospector or The Swarm with spike 'nades. Not to mention all the crucible pinnacle weapons (of which I have none) are all OP in PvE. The complaints are all about balancing and making the game even better than it has been, despite how much it's clearly improved. The destiny fan base won't stop asking bungie to 'fix' things unless they completely stop caring about the game, and by then it'll be dead anyways. The fact that people still complain means they're still playing. And that's all that Mr. Accountant at bungie sees when the dollar signs come rolling in.
---
How do you even get 20 avalanches?
---
I low key hate control in comp. If you are in a team full of solos then literally no one knows what a zone is.
---
1kv is so much worse than this
---
Its intended to be a season long quest. 
---
Are you expecting a quest that gives you the full armor set after 5 games? Come on man.
---
#löaf
---
It’s just hard trying to carry a team of blueberries against fully stacked teams
---
Also some of the dumbest also play lol 😂. And they’re usually at public events or in PvP! Hahaha
---
I have literally never seen one of those.
---
I would love to try and help, if only we knew what the problem was.
---
&gt; Hey guys, so I have this problem,
---
You are aware that you didn't actually list a problem, right? You literally don't tell us what the error/issue you are having is....
---
Why do people refuse to put any effort at all into posts these days? Don't you want the best help you can get? Don't you think the help you get would be better if we knew what you were talking about?
---
Ugh.
---
love how you gave electro thunderlord
---
Just get a slave to do it for you like i did/do
---
I’ve played at least 50 games
---
Did you try the cheese for the game completions? Unless they fixed it
---
I thought nobody would notice!
---
No I didn’t try
---
There is LITERALLY a post that is stickied to the top of this sub. Literally browsing to this sub and clicking on the top link answers all of these questions.
---
Why do you refuse to look for the answers before making a low effort post?
---
I am simple man, when I see enemy bag teammate, I bag enemy
---
You’re a good man. Thank you
---
Do you know how to do it?
---
Lol I’d rather save my money to fork over to Bungie on the next expansion
---
there will be another IB this season a.k.a. next month and bungo is gonna make the quest less tedious
---
He does it for free he has no choice
---
Yeah I’m somewhat of a *inhales* white knight. I don’t partake in such scandalous activities
---
OK? That doesn't change anything I said. Its intended to be a season long. Still seems like you expect a full set after some small set number of games.
---
It tethers the ones that spawn from the raised platforms instantly.
---
Impatience, from I think Warmind.
---
Field prep is also important, not as important at spike but does more for the gun then hard launch
---
Aye aye captain I shall dedicate my whole existence to this game. My bad
---
Rule 15. /r/sharditkeepit 
---
Ruke 16. Direct-capture screenshots only.
---
Lollll
---
Seeing as newer season haven't come out yet (this current season is the last part of that infographic), I cannot say for sure.
---
are you really just gonna reupload bungies video like this for views? lol
---
Most armor is randomly rolled.  Lucky pants is the only exotic that would really help more than normal handcannon perks
---
It's so frustrating haha. It's all I need for the damn badge
---
-i run shottie and hand cannon bc they’ve served me well for a good time. ur right abt the counters, it’s somewhat easy to avoid the shots. i just hate teams who abuse it down a lane
---
-regarding the classes, i know. warlock supers are good depending on the map, however the super regen on a titan is a lot more noticeable than bottom tree daw blade, and the amount of time hunter supers last seem way longer than warlock supers.
---
Synthoceps are class neutral. They work best with Bottom Tree Striker. However, top tree Defender grants overshield, mid tree places detonators, bottom tree increases shield damage.
---
Besides, Titans melee is awful without them.
---
Unlucky. You can do all the eggs that you shoot with wishender and you can give the cats all the gifts for a better chance as well
---
Hunter because I wanna be a cowboy, baaaybeeee.
---
The fact that the Titan set is not symmetrical is bothering me a bit
---
Jotunn deals with blockers beautifully too. I bring jotunn on almost every game of gambit I play.
---
INDEED
---
Thanks!
---
Thanks, I appreciate it.
---
Is there no way to turn off thr glowy bits?
---
FoeTracer
---

---
Legendaries, enhanced hand Canon stuffs which is, Dreaing City, Last Wish, Scourge, Tier-3, Iron Banana, Crown and Menagerie.
---
I pretty much play with default bindings. I’ve set some stuff like melee, grenade and class ability on my extra mouse buttons. But other than that it’s just whatever feels comfortable to you. If something feels off in a week or two, put it somewhere else and see how it goes.
---
Why do the builders of the wall of wishes need to print the logos in foil on paper?
---
Just because the image printed here looks KIND OF like a symbol from the raid, you felt this needed to be posted?
---
I swear some of you are way too easily amused.
---
If you think that shreds, use recluse
---
I havent done any yet, but it seems like the visage of calus statue sells 4 tributes quests each able to give 5 tributes, so does it restock or what?
---
been trying , for about 5 weeks now . that and doing as many Spider bounties as I can
---
There probably is. Last years armor you could.
---
meanwhile when i snipe i get teamshot almost constantly and my blueberries are running in 3 separate directions picking flowers or sum shit
---
Jotunn doesn't sound like a hammer tho......
---
That makes more sense
---
I am , lol . just getting all the last few armor pieces I dont have and dont want ...
---
i though it sounded similar to the sun breaker pop. oh well rip me
---
Thankfully , Xur wont be able to give me any more crap armor since I got all of them now , so next week I should be getting LoW !
---
Ya he sells a fallen tribute that you can buy 5 times a hive tribute you can buy five times a cabal one that you can buy five times and 5 you can buy for bright dust and 5 for legendary shards and there is a bunch of tributes you can get for doing triumphs. To see the triumphs got to triumphs then destinations then go over to the second page and you should see tribute hall. You can do all the triumphs for free tributes
---
It’s actually one of the fish symbols, I just thought it was cool. No need to be so negative.
---
The bounties that he gives give you an item that when you turn it in it reduces the cost of the tributes by 1%. Doing 80 of those bounties is another triumph and at the end when you've done them the tributes will be 80% off
---
Yeah, maybe
---
Yeah. I've done all the cats. Need to do all the eggs though. The pain lol
---
As you wish
---
correct... here's your virtual pat on the back: \*\*pat pat\*\*
---
must've just been bad luck. I drop into them occasionally for bounties and get matched up in the normal amount of time.
---
No joke did last wish with some random and a couple friends and we all used rat king. We called it "jah king" and wow is it crazy with 5 other people.
---
Its not the same fish symbol. Its a similar looking image. I'm not being negative. I really see no point in posting this. The link to the game is about as paper thin as that foil this person is using to print. 
---
Its not good content to me, sorry I don't like low effort posts.
---
We don't do that here
---
You’ve inspired me to try this. Thanks OP!
---
IKEA sparrow
---
It's because the base set isn't. I like some asymmetry in shoulders myself
---
A Warloxk's sight looks inwards for he is the whole universe
---
Laughed too much to this tbh xD
---
Am I the only one excited to cruise around on the moan in a boat? Tiny sparrow is meme-worthy but the boat sparrow is a great design with an amazing finished look. And I really look forward to seeing the previews of it in all my shaders.
---
Titan because space middle ages
---
im not so sure they could nerf them as hard as they nerfed luna.  luna is incredibly horrendous on pc now (not that i know what it was like pre nerf but it is borderline unusable in its current state).  they would have to make some drastic changes to mt and recluse to put them in that same state.  
---
regardless, a nerf is probably coming sooner or later for both those weapons.
---
It’s on my skull of dire ahamkara, helps with the nerf.
---
Not really you just get emblems and triumphs for quick play, the wins do count towards a recluse triumph “the stuff of myth” and iron banner matches boosts it even further faster than normal crucible ones
---
Nice, what shotgun is that? Also noticed some mad stow and equip speeds on those weapons.
---
Oh boy, finish the quest.
---
Also you can go into shaders and delete one and it brings you back into the game.
---
Mine was trying to get Lumina and I had to get a hand cannon kill or whatever in pvp. I was upset as I had gotten SO DAMN CLOSE multiple times and finally a new team would invade and just let people kill them for it. I was so happy.
---
(I am not a pvp player. I suck at it and it pisses me off quick)
---
Chode sparrow
---
Ah okay thanks
---
Because you didn't read...
---
We ran the nightfall after that just for shits and giggles cause...I mean...we got it so we might as well use it! The amount of add clears you can do with three outbreaks is utterly beautiful. Nobody stood a chance
---
You can do it the first time tryna get fabled seems so far but once you get there any other weapons that require you to get to fabled are easy
---
Thanks!!
---
For me, it's Outbreak Perfected, hands down. Non exotic, I love my Go Figure with ricochet rounds and rampage.
---
Whatever you want.
---
I have the legendary Go Figure and find that really good. Not sure if there is a better pulse rifle out there, but that one certainly works great for me.
---
I’ll try it out when I get off work grinded for it last night till 3 in the morning once I got it I KOed
---
It’s on my skull of dire ahamkara, so it helps with the nerf.
---
Good idea for a Evereverse Ornament. Haha Everytime he gets a over shield the music plays.
---
The three best non exotic pulses in game currently are Blast Furnace, Go Figure, and Bygones.
