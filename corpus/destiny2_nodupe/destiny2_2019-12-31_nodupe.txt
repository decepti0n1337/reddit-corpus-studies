I am also a Wayfarer. IDGAF I love my title.

Implying that bubble is problematic/toxic. Come on man its a wasted super lol. Nothing to get passionate about
---
These reasons are why most players dislike gambit. It's not that Gambit is bad, it's that your teammates actively playing for the other team is bad.

Nothing makes me happier than when Shaxx tells me I'm more dangerous than an extinction-level event in the crucible
---
also the Titan armor in the season pass has a high stat total, but it's not a great roll. all the pieces have way too much resilience
---
Ghat dang cheaters finding new ways to grief... These types of players need to GTFO of this game, it doesn't need anymore bad press as it is right now!

Subtract 47 points. That is base stat.

This is the way.

Crucible is a good way to obtain weapons?
---
I'm not going solo. I can barely clear a vanguard strike solo. Just finished with a fireteam of professional badasses who already had the catalyst with probably a lot of progress on it. And no, I dont have Raiden flux or Liar's Handshake
---
Yep, and my stress levels have gone down considerably whenever I stop doing PvP. The problem is that they keep tying really good weapons to PvP.
---
This is quality didnt no it was possible to hit so many walls at such high speeds without dying lmao
---
Not necessarily, but resetting ranks have a very low chance to give you an exotic I think. Gambit prime and reckoning will give you better weapons. Also quests for various exotics can give you a legendary weapon that coincides with the exotic (ex: lumina quest gives you Rose)

Look at that boulder! That is a nice boulder!

The architects blessed me that day

Thank you!!

I stopped doing it because of all the camping. Whole teams of people not even playing the objective and just sitting on heavy made getting heavy difficult. When I finally did get heavy, I was killed almost immediately. Played about 50ish games, probably more since I was doing the Dawning Questline too.

Glad you're enjoying it, but just FYI Level advantages are disabled in PvP modes except for Iron Banner.

what do you think the problem is teamates,your aim,or your weapons
---
I love earning the "Dodge this" medal from a melee. :)
---
But shaxx is black?
---
You can use almost any roll on a shotgun and be pretty effective. However, you can‚Äôt come in with a trash fusion and be nearly as effective. I‚Äôd assume that‚Äôs why you are seeing such a high number of people using shotguns.
---
You can‚Äôt kill two full health guardians with one shotgun shot, but you can do it all day with the fusion. You can also shoot that fusion up to 30, yes, 30 meters away and get a one shot kill before the guy you‚Äôre shooting at can even get his second shot off.
---
The Erentil absolutely needs a range nerf. It should be the answer to shotguns and guardians grouped up in tights quarters. It shouldn‚Äôt be the answer to me using my sniper rifle. Just because not that many people are farming a god roll fusion doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not a problem.
---
But to each their own. Cheers!
---
r/oddlysatisfying
---
I said OP as in in general. It 100% has the highest DPS of any shotgun in the game and with the catalyst that number increases even more. The catalyst also makes the pre-release the wolves mode a laser when clicking in crit spots I meant OP in PVE I apologize for not being more specific
---
Yeah most people are complaining "it's too hard to get into" or "I had no idea what I was doing". 
---
This has to be the most common complaint that any MMORPG receives. Because Destiny is also an FPS, people expect it so be as simple as any other FPS, but it's no CoD, Halo or Battlefield. 
---
I shutter to think what would happen to these people if they tried playing something like Warframe.
---
You can get get max level as a free player you'll just have less activities which grant you higher level gear. Depending on whether you bought the Y1 annual pass or the Y2 you might need to buy Forsaken for the Y2 content. If you want to participate in the current Season of Dawn activities you'll need to buy the Season Pass from the Eververse Store, or Shadowkeep which includes the currently active Season Pass.

When I rolled my exotic engram from Xur. He gave me stag.
---
Its not lag lmao why do you keep calling it lag
---
Joblest
---
Both equally annoy my being
---
I can see how some people might feel that way, particularly if they like the RPG elements and not just the FPS characteristics.  In fact, it reminds me of all the potions from Elder Scrolls/Skyrim.  I expected it in Skyrim but not Destiny.
---
I play D as an outlet.  Blowing s up virtually is therapeutic for me, so other busywork that takes up my very limited time is frustrating.  That, and maybe I‚Äôm just an impatient d**k.  
---
Oh well, it‚Äôs a new year and people can change.
---
I get frustrated if I die to Jotunn because it's so easy to dodge.
---
You're right, but I really want to enjoy the graphics, especially on my new monitor (Dell 32" 1440p 165hz freesync HDR). I turned it on on in my current system, and it was sooooo gorgeous I felt compelled to upgrade.
---
So what would it take to get even more fps, like 100+ average?
---
Would you say an i7 9700K, RTX 2080 Super, nvme, 3600mhz RAM? or do you think we'll need more power?
---
Are they not supposed to try?
---
Try rumble let the first game pass you by then you get likewise players
---
Sorry to tell you, but you have to play for a while in Crucible before you figure out the meta, then you use those weapons. It's the only way to get by, really, and the meta is painfully broken and unfun. A little tip, go do menagerie for a good roll on Dust Rock Blues, and that will at least help.
---
I am confushis
---
I haven't seen much of the T-bagging, but I have seen a lot of people get nasty over the heavy ammo.  Everyone is trying to get the 10 RL kills and everyone who isn't is trying to take advantage of the gathering and mayhem at the heavy dispenser. More than a few messages asking for a chance to get a few kills... And others irate the answer was no.
---
Lots of kids on vacation and didn't get CoD for Christmas.

I‚Äôll have to work on that lol

Heh, ready to drop?

I literally watched that video a couple hours ago

Me but with Titan fall because pvp is straight bs on destiny.

literally just the letter J

I threw it on because I was about to play some IB. It's a lot of fun in the crucible.

On Nessus near one of the Vex transformers you need for an obelisk quest

In the trailer for his character, but in the first mission of D2 and the cutscene he is a bubble
---
Lots of takes and doing my best to match up frames. One thing that helped me was setting my controller sensitivity super low so I could have a base speed for the rotational shot that wasnt too fast. Then it was just guesswork with the front facing shots. Again, just taking multiple shots of me dancing and hoping they line up.

Yes, but in another cutscene he punches the shit out of some fallen with lightning

Which utterly fails because it means certain weapon, exotic, and ability combinations are inherently infeasible due to the elemental affinity of the mods associated with the them.
---
no mercy in that murdee
---
It's sad because people will actually fall for this
---
Check out CheeseForever on YouTube, he posted a video on how to go invisible in the crucible. As far as I know it works on any class
---
id assume so, the game has been out a while but still i get put into games that are ending
---
Wish-ender destroys in Gambit right now though. Now would definitely be the time to be grinding Hush.
---
F that guy man
---
More like spider web nightmare game code everywhere
---
Arbalest since you have way more time to react to a jotuun
---
You're complaining about RNG being RNG though. You can get higher stats than a 59 you just have to keep at it. Or don't bother, it's not like the stats make such a huge difference.
---
I tried to keep the camera in the relatively same spot for every clip by setting my controller sensitivity very low and guessing the time I need to turn it every time. Theres alot of tweaking of the camera behind the scenes because it's hard to find the right spot until a certain point in the animation. Letting the emote loop helped in finding the right angle too.
---
I'm guessing he is referring to the ogre being blinded by titan bubble?
---
.... yes, the trailer for his character which is the first thing I said. But that is when he was a ‚Äúyoung‚Äù guardian, as far as we are aware, now he is a bubble Titan in his later years
---
I misunderstood you, you're right
---
I'm on xbox so I dont believe there is a way to do that. This is still an unfinished project in my mind and part of me wants to fill the left and right empty space with other emotes but we will see!
---
That makes so much sense idk why I didn't think of doing the weekly challenges. Thanks for the reccomendation I'll try it rn. I'm light level 953 so I think I meet the requirements.

Well, they probably didn't expect it.

No he was a cutscene death
---
Stop I can only get so many Nam flashbacks
---
thanks, now that you mention it I totally forgot about that one.. Its been a while :D
---
My point of frustration is that for the difficulty of the pursuit to actually hand in tokens the rewards don‚Äôt match up, you should be getting guaranteed either weapon or armour drops from iron banner and the pursuit reward should feel like it‚Äôs worth the effort. Iron banner isn‚Äôt that much fun to do and having to fight through levels of rng on top of that doesn‚Äôt make it any better, destiny 1 iron banner was way better.
---
Either wait for flash point or just start a new character and get it on your way through.
---
With my black armory bow, sometimes it feels that all i can hit are headshots but when it's crucible time, they gone
---
I disagree massively. When I‚Äôm hitting 20+ kills and getting tweedle dum and tweedle Dee on 0.7 and 0.8 it‚Äôs hard to win
---
You forgot when teammates kill the last envoy with an invader present this killing your dps phase.  Drives me nuts. Take care of the invader. Then melt.
---

Most cheaters don't care, they are in it knowing that they will lose their accounts. They play for completely different reasons as us.

I've had lag so bad that I blasted someone point blank, see them melee me a second later, then a solid second later both of us die.

And you're seriously going to try and argue it's happening every single match, are you?
---
Hmm using bugged Wishender what a surprise...
---
Youtube
---
You dont know they‚Äôre better than you until you try to beat them, also how do you know they‚Äôre higher glory than you? Sounds like an easy cop out to me.
---
Teammates doing bounties and could careless if they help the team or not.
---
I don't even got that and I got Dredgen, Unbroken, CurseBreaker and MMXIX. Congrats on Wayfarer because that's too much for me!
---
Random teams never communicate but even then it's not hard to win if your teammates just know how the game works
---
No obviously not. But I just think and similar glory matchmaking would give people a better chance at progression
---
Honestly what I do is pick a role. Most of the time it's killing big targets and invaders. This way the blueberries already can do what they do. Pick up motes and bank. Because I took down the heavy hitters they have a bigger chance of survival. And when we are close to 90 motes in prime for instance I help them 100% to bank till 100. The rest depends on situation, like blockers, invasions and my own performance. 
---
My team will perform better and I am not a crybaby :)
---
Because I ask them and look on Destiny tracker smart arse.
---
That's the only reason I turned in my tokens. 
---
'That and the godroll Gunnora's Axe with Quickdraw/Opening Shot that I've been trying to get ever since they gave it random rolls.'
---
Let's be honest, how many random teammates actually pull that off
---
You left out "2 people leave after the first round and no backfill."
---
I thought u just ran the strike on the director like u find it on the edz
---
Dominos would have to be good pizza for this to be funny
---
Holy shit!!!
---
If you still need help and are on pc, send me a PM
---
Is this young Datto doing Nerf YouTube videos about optimizing your DPS?
---
Knowing how the game works is kinda the problem here though, as it seems that either they  or I might not understand the game, as they seem to be doing a different thing than what I think is the goal.
---
That honestly might be a network issue bungo is notorious for having subpar netcode and online experience
---
I thought this had something to do with Wishender. Too funny when I realized what was going on.
---
Hehehe that's me!
---
It is 2018
---
Always nice to see some Gambit love
---
Maybe it's because I started late, but since I started that step, I haven't had a single match where the primary objective wasn't camping around the heavy armor.  I was fine with the rest of the steps because I could complete them within the context of the game, but this is just a bunch of people playing selfishly (me included) and it's not fun.  Of the limited time I have to play games, a disproportionate amount of that has been Destiny (Since D1), but I'm wondering if I want to do that anymore.
---
The game is good at face value. Shoot some aliens, get better guns to shoot bigger aliens. Play a Gambit match here, do some bounties there, all well and good. It's when you do anything beyond that and look at how much of a time sink everything is and how poor the quality of loot has become that you start to regret booting up the game.
---
Twice recycled IB armor, reskinned EV armor for the raid, the hideous moon armor, no NF specific loot for the new strikes, no vendor refresh in over a year, the list goes on. Sure the sundial weapons look great but only one of them is really any good and it's for one specific purpose.
---
I'd be perfectly fine with no seasonal activity next season if it meant we got some god damn loot in a looter shooter. I wanna see an absolute chad walking about the tower in his sparkling prestige raid armor and god-rolled weapons that took 3 weeks of attempts and immense skill to get, not spawn in to everybody wearing the same set because it's handed to us by the season pass.
---
When I try to do that it says must own season 8
---
Pretty sure matchmaking is skill based, and it does its best to give you a 50% win rate. 
---
We've all been through some matchmaking bullshit, don't act like you're being singled out by the system and deserve to be higher rank, you're not, and you don't if your attitiude is to blame your team mates or match making.
---
That‚Äôs bullying then
---
I don‚Äôt think bubbles should be breakable. Period. 
---
THEN I‚Äôd run them :)

What‚Äôs your gaming setup? Your video looks crisp.

Ikora saw the Ahamkara item and fucking punished you for it. No choice, just fucking deleted.
---
Left is me in pve, right is me in pvp.
---
Lmao that happened to me in D1
---
How am I acting like I‚Äôm being singled out ? I‚Äôm clearly just saying that matchmaking someone at 3500 against someone at 5300 is wrong.
---
I invade a LOT in gambit, and given that I will usually get manage to kill around 3 of the enemy team, its painful to watch a random invade and die instantly. You could've been more useful gathering motes! That didn't help anyone you know!
---
My point still stands, if you arent top-tier you should expect to be given top-tier rewards. Once again, git gud.
---
Bud either deal with it or find a new game you should have learned by now bunjie doesn't take pvp serious so you shouldn't either
---
Hammerhead is absolutely amazing for it. Really wrecks from a distance. 
---
And then Sleeper Simulant is great too cuz you just need to aim anywhere close to a dude and they melt. 
---
If your aim is good, run snipers to get headshots. 
---
Any homing rocket launcher would do well too. 
---
It's very daunting at first but once you get some experience in, it comes naturally. 
---
Hope this helps.
---
That is true, but many characters have a preferred subclass. Cayde was known for using golden gun, so is Ana Bray, Saint14 is known to be a void Titan, Osiris is known to be a solar warlock, and even lesser know characters like Tevis who is know to only use Nightstalker. All guardians have access to most subclasses one lore, but they all prefer to use one over the others
---
Actually Gambit is pretty bad
---
I wish I were able to ignore stats and where what I liked. Unfortunately there‚Äôs no way I can force myself to wear weaker armor...
---
No but I mean it's always the same memes about depositing and killing envoys but ingame it's a crapshoot if you're gonna be able to find people who know what they're doing
---
&gt; I‚Äôm stuck at 3500 because of the matchmaking. I‚Äôm facing players that are 2000 glory above me and losing constantly in freelance and just cannot progress at all.
---
Read this again.
---
I‚Äôm only just getting back on it after like 2 years off the game mate haha
---
It means no matter if you killed them, they will respawn right in front of you and kill you while they have an overshield.

You don't actually need to do it yourself, you just need a team mate to get it three times instead, or that's what it used to be anyway
---
What‚Äôs the build??
---
Who the fuck said that?
---
Get Truth. Become the bane of the enemy team in one heavy brick. I have 63 one man army medals because of it
---
I‚Äôm facing people 2000 above me and can‚Äôt progress? So you‚Äôre saying Liverpool playing a team a division lower is a fair game then? And the other team should just get good and deal with it üòÇ. There are rankings for a reason
---
I agree. However, compared to D1 the raid armor is extremely lack luster.
---
If you're a hunter, you should try maxing out Mobility. Dodge every 9 seconds.
---
I'm in this image and I don't like it. Give a little benefit of the doubt to those who just started playing, dammit ;~;
---
I wish I had a team of 6 friends for this bs
---
&gt;Shaxx would be disappointed
---
You are a liar and a cheat. Stay out of my Gambit
---
Nah I would enjoy Gambit if my team wasn't getting invaded every second because we summoned our Primeval quicker than the other team. You can't escape a Truth invader rocket every 30 secs or however long it is
---
Weekly bounties and saint 14 daily bounties will give you more than enough.
---
Sometimes it's fun to be the bad guy!
---
I never knew Destiny was on mobile.
---
Had one invade several times and the only kills he got were from the PvE enemies after he tickled us. I know the other team must've been heated
---
That's why I became a reaper. Everyone likes to fucking hunt down motes like they're damn eggs on Easter so go ahead and take all of them. I'll just kill everything myself.
---
Sike
---
Ehh, all of us have done it before. Although I just do it if I'm at like 7 motes and need 3 more.
---
Starting with Shadowkeep assumes the new player isn't F2P, which is not the best assumption considering that's their monetization model. Red War is still the bulk of their available campaign content and I think they'd do well promoting it more to new free players who need to be eased into Destiny's model after coming from a more standard FPS experience.
---
Yes.
---
I just played a match where somehow it went to tie-breaker in gambit prime. 
---
Then when the bank hit 100 NEITHER team could summon.  
---
To my team-mates credit everyone stayed for 5 minutes. 
---
When then went into ANOTHER tie breaker match where we pulled off the W. 
---
That's enough gambit for tonight boys.
---
You can generally get an idea of what the other team is doing based on the amount of motes they banked, the blockers they send over, and if they're damaging the primeval or not.
---
Ideally, during the primeval phase, you want to invade as soon as your damage phase is over and theirs is beginning. Even if you dont kill them, wasting their time and getting them off the primeval is still effective.
---
During the mote phase, you can see how many motes they are holding onto based on the grey bar at the top. When it looks like they have a shitload of motes, it's a decent time to invade. A good time to invade is after your team banks after their second set of adds and sends a few blockers over, while the other team hasnt banked yet; the other team will be sitting on a ton of motes and will be dealing with blockers to bank (if theres 2+, theyll be killing the blockers because the motes will be draining).
---
It's very situational, including if you have heavy, your super up, etc. In general, if your portal comes up as their invader leaves, youre going to be looking at a 1v1 with them most likely when you jump through since theyll spawn back on their home side generally closer or in the same area as you spawn on their side.
---
Aside from that, use weps youre comfortable with, but as others mentioned, Truth is basically a few free kills per invade, hammerhead is solid overall, izanagis w/ charged shot will 1 shot invaders,  and as of lately, ive been liking symmetry because you rack up stacks quickly on the primeval and you can either choose to unload them on the boss for a ton of dmg or just 2 shot an invader with semi-tracking shots.
---
My Iron Banana rolls haven't been half as good as last season but the seasonal armors stats were pretty on point just from the pass average 64-66 which isn't to shabby that and the masterworked dune Marchers I have sitting at 84.
---
You never know what build and gear you should bring when you go into Gambit with randoms, which is critically important, considering how entire mod works. Mob clearing one is set with specialized weapons, perks, mods, and abilities/subclasses. Boss/primal nuker requires, again, completely different loadout. For invading you need absolutely different build and gear too. 
---
When you drop with randoms, you have no idea who can do what, and it turns into twisted game of dice. If opponents team is lucky enough with 1 good invader, 2 mob cleaners and/or nukers - you're doomed no matter what. Invasion mechanic is way too complicated and too gamechanging for PUGs, it will always ruin matches and never will be fun outside of pre-made competitive teams. Playing against bots or making tutorials will not solve these issues. If Bungie wants PUGs in Gambit, disabling Invasions is the only way.
---
Nice! What were you running? Weapons, exotics, subclass, stat distribution.
---
[[Gambit Prime]]
---
Invader main. I will usually invade as soon as the primeval spawns. Apply pressure to the enemy team. Anyone distracted by me isn't killing envoys, and anyone killing envoys is an easy target for me.
---
Besides, the portal is on approximately a 30 second refresh timer (which starts after the invasion ends), and in my experience the enemy can't usually recover from a good invasion quick enough to clear envoys AND get good damage on the primeval before I can invade again.
---
(Note: a GOOD invasion. If your invasions are shit, none of the rest of this post matters. Have your T3 Invader gear. If you can't wipe the enemy team, at the very least kill the ones playing the objective and distract the ones who are targetting you. Most importantly: STAY ALIVE. If your invasion ends early because you died, all of them can go right back to playing the objective. Staying alive, even with no kills, serves as pressure and a delay to the enemy team as a whole. Because just them knowing you're there makes them nervous. If you can't teamwipe, the best thing you can do is run out the invasion clock.)
---
So, ideally, I invade as soon as I can. Pressure the team for that first invasion. Teamwipe if I can, delay and distract if I can't. Invasion ends, wait for the timer and the portal to respawn. Usually during this time, the enemy team clears the first 2 envoys and clears the 3rd either as I'm invading or just before. Not enough time to get good damage on the Primeval, *but that's not why I'm invading*. My second invasion serves the same purpose as the first, delay and distract. Heal what little damage they might do to the Primeval sure, but the ultimate purpose is to get them *to waste their damage phase worrying about me*. This allows you to get TWO effective invasions (and delays) in by the end of their FIRST damage phase. As opposed to getting ONE invasion and some heals (with no good delay) by the end of their first damage phase. When you wait to invade, they also get an extra stack of Primeval Slayer sooner than they would normally, and can deal damage and end the round faster than if you had properly delayed them. Yes, even if you teamwipe and heal the primeval back to full.
---
Because, as strange as it sounds, damaging the primeval does not win games. Building Slayer stacks faster than the enemy team wins games. Healing the Primeval doesn't matter *as much* (it still matters) when the other team has the stacks to wipe it in one damage phase.
---
TL;DR- Invading right away is, in my opinion, critical to the early-late-game timing. The first invasion serves as a delay, even though people seem to think its a waste if there's no damage to heal. It's not. Timed properly, and the second invasion can do that too. It slows down their damage, slows down how fast they get Primeval Slayer stacks, and buys your team time to do whatever needs to be done. Waiting until there is damage done to the Primeval that you can heal does next to nothing, because the enemy still got the most important part of the damage phase: the Primeval Slayer stack. And they got it faster than if you had delayed.
---
What lore book would that be may I ask?

The only reason I play gambit is when a quest forces me to.

When does the event end?
---
Its also arc mod
---
Is that the same as power?
---
Unless you're on PC, I don't think hacking is that big of a problem. 
---
I have been personally playing around with some builds lately, trying to find one that suits me ( Le'Monarque has been really darn fun ) to use once Trials returns ( Saint-14's vendor set up is a little bit of a teaser ain't it ), in hopes of getting the armour from there. If it's anything like D1's, or hell, even the Trails of the Nine armour, it's going to absolutely slap
---
Meanwhile player guardians change subclass between every raid encounter
---
Looks like it's crying
---
Yes
---
Maybe I didn't express myself clearly. My frustration is based on the shift in priorities caused by the quest. The point of IB is to win. Wins are easier to come by when the team has advantage by capturing points. Creating the necessity to grab heavy made a 4th point that isn't in line with what actually lines up with the game. 
---
My specific annoyance caused by trying to smash IB with all three characters this weeks was necessitated by my work/school schedule. It's highly unlikely that I'll be able to play as much as I want during the next IBs. I also don't particularly like that the Destiny folks have created very specific lanes for us to stay in while we play while advocating a play-your-way style. 
---
Also, I don't think it's fair to call it "10 heavy kills over 3 weeks" while yes, may be mechanically true, discounts the environmental challenges of every single other person on the map trying to do the same thing. 
---
But you're right. The game did stress me out more than what was appropriate. The thing is, that was the point of the post in the first place. I recognized that game made me upset, beyond what I found acceptable.  I doubt that I'm the only person in this boat. I just thought I'd share hopefully spark a conversation about how to improve the situation for both new and veteran players, not to whine about how I had a bad time.

Well won't happen to me again. Got the brilliant Idea to buy a charger for my controller. I can charge 4 of them in a single charge. So no reason to be AFK for more then mere seconds !
---
I feel you.
---
Can confirm
---
- am warlock
---
Loads of people basically use it that way right now in gambit, using a better primary in their energy slot then essentially using wishender as a special.
---
It's the shiny object at the moment. It's unfortunate, but it's just the reality, Guardian. Keep pushing. You'll get it done.
---
1. Did you cross save and switch to a different platform? Dlcs don't transfer.
---
2. Make sure its downloaded. If it is try deleting and reinstalling.
---
3. I'm not saying this to be a dick, but are you sure you actually bought it?
---
But having no flag captures because you ignored the objectives.
---
3 hour gauntlet is always fun...
---
16:23, didn't get it.
---
What the fuck.
---
Any time to prepare? It is been months since the shadowkeep release and I can still see a teleporting titan shoulder charging me when I close my eyes.
---
Mods don't get pulled from collections. Collections just shows you what you have and have not unlocked. If you equip a season of dawn arc chest piece the mod will just be there ready to equip.
---
Yikes I do that thing where I invade when their primeval is full. Gotta stop doing that
---
The problem with Iron banner quest isn‚Äôt the grind it‚Äôs the shit quest design. Rocket launcher kills is so unbelievably stupid for a quest step in a objective based pvp mode. When you‚Äôre on that step you have to say fuck all to capturing the objective and hard camp the heavy in hopes you get 2 kills with your rocket.
---
I can definitely see Hush use that.
---
switched from blizzard (PC) to steam (PC).   
---
I actually bought it and I'm missing 99% of my items. The only thing that was transferred was my one character. Despite also getting all 3 finished with warmind
---
My issue is losing 15 motes. People wont clear any ads, and let blockers pile up till someone invades or I get overwhelmed. I swear I'm the only one doing work, especially when I'm always top of my team
---
I never played last year's event event and I really wish I did now. 1 because of this damn quest and 2 because of the armour which is now locked behind silver.
---
Pretty much... It's also why I only play on normal, so the sweatys don't get as mad .. doesn't stop it entirely, but I don't feel as bad about it in normal Gambit
---
I can vault all of mine tho, right?
---
I don't know what to say after reading this! Thanks
---
Thank you

The names 14, Saint 14.

---
No such thing
---
I love it.
---
Yarp
---
If you're on PC, I'll help you. I helped 5 people yesterday and I've got over 1,000 clears of it. I can also help you start the catalyst and the quest for the ship.
---
Yikes. I hope I can bake all those cookies. I'm at about 180. ‚òπÔ∏è
---
This needs more attention
---
You really pinned your own joke?
---
Then why do you call them missions?
---
Because I used the wrong word?
---
Do you have an ornament for the malfeasance or did you just get it
---
Hmmm....
---
Did this mele attack got buffed since season of dawn or there's a mecanic i don't know that increases dmg with more enemies hit  ?
---
You‚Äôre not fooling anyone Asher.
---
Okay, then. That makes sense. Btw, there is an edit function on Reddit.
---
The Forsaken campaign is accessed from the Tangled Shore Director, Not Holiday.
---
I know. Thanks
---
This should be the medal for getting a 100 killstreak.
---
Cosmodrome - snipers nest and space to Titan skate
---
Dreadnought - all the quests and bounty things
---
Cool thanks üëç
---
And this is why I never play anything with Matchmaking: ON. 
---
I have no idea what I'm doing AND I get bored easily.
---
Yea I feel you
---
u/NotAnotherGirlGamer: Anthem is where it's at
---
Loved it before peregrine greaves was nerfed now I don‚Äôt use ut
---
Maybe your team should have played lives better then.
---
It would be fine if IB this time around allowed for heavy to be dropped from player kills. Shit sucks, keep getting my ass chewed out because everyone's trying to bubble/rift the heavy in hopes of collecting heavy, but they all wipe to the nova bomb. Fuck this quest. Quit locking tokens behind shitty timegates bungie.
---
what if i don't wanna use discord or voice chat?
---
are raids dead to me for destiny 2?
---
The Thicc armour in between his legs
---
I was doing the scout rifle kills earlier (I didn't finish it because it glitched for an entire match). It drove me up the wall. I just quit. I was in a six stack of non try hards, so I just used a sit emote and let the enemies work on their quest instead. I got 11 final blows on one round, went to check the progress and it was still at 3.  
---
Few rounds later I got too annoyed and just said fuck it, and went back to my baby Crimson.
---
I just go sit with their ghosts
---
My favourite was rock 2
---
I once beat a full stack with calligraphic names in gambit as solo queue.
---
This brings me peace just like hat kid dancing
---
They are
---
I struggle with this! Want to try all the raids as not done one yet but there‚Äôs no matching
---
Used Deathbringer on both ny Titan and Hunter. T'was amazing getting those random kills long after I fired my rocket
---
Why should we have to though? Why is it every other multiplayer game that exists can matchmake you with other players except Destiny. The games been out for how long now and players have been screaming for it since release.
---
I'm glad to hear I'm not the only one. That quest step nearly broke my entire spirit.
---
I T I S A G O O D P A I N
---
Gotta be joking mate, grow up
---
yeah! That‚Äôs it. mb
---
I find it honestly baffling that you don't have money to buy your own PC and open a GoFundMe for basically high end hardware. A RTX 1070 super? With an alienware 240Hz monitor? A 800 watt power supply? 
---
I'm all for helping people get acces to a computer if they need it, especially if it's for studies, this is just ridiculous...
---
I see absolutely no reason why people should pay for your $2000 gaming rig.
---
Titan armour grants Titans super strength so my headcanon has always been that the knife can't instantly take down the shield and kill, but a super strength punch will just rock your shit. At least that way it makes sense.
---
Saying that though, aren't only the shoulder charges OHKO? And if you throw the massive knife to the face it's also a OHKO (which also doesn't make sense, surely throwing would do less damage than physically ramming it in their face)
---
sorry I have a negative score for understanding destiny stuff. I thought you said ‚Äúusername (vex milk) gives you wings‚Äù and I thought yooo you can get wings in destiny!?
---
Shotguns are fun and balanced and I‚Äôm very glad they‚Äôre a blind one shot kill 
---
/s
---
When you‚Äôre team is so shit at gambit you hack the game just to kill them than depart the match.
---
jeez. Is it the best gun to get in the game or is it like a trophy?
---
Found a guy named Nigglet, Darkness' Herald
---
Arcstrider
---
When I first did it my friends told me that one of those doors was randomly selected every time you load in, and you had to guess which one it was. My gullible ass fell for it and there was about 5 to 10 minutes of me going in and out of them until they got bored, I'm never gonna live it down üòÇ
---
No i play on console :(. The loading times are abysmal and the preformance can vary
---
Yep, it's super balanced
---
Lmao y'all would have loved playing with me when I was getting those damn shot gun kills. Triple shot guns and omfg I died so much. Lost 63 motes jn one match. Wasnt trying to pick them up but its hard when you are chest to chest shot gunning a holes. Dont play like that normally though.
---
ehhhhh
---
crotas end or kings fall imo
---
There's a delay between the app and the game. You're probably just joining too late. Have you tried making your own post?
---
Suddenly the time ran out, but timer was there the whole time so I guess it wasn't suddenly.
---
Unlucky rare bounty lol
---
they're all respectable imo
---
You can use the companion app to make a fireteam.
---
Thought this was a Pokemon painting until I spotted Shaxx-dadyy.
---
The Jedi Masters were not far from the truth... you need to stop aiming and trusting the force. When I aim, I hit nothing, but when I just let it flow, I hit the 360 no-scope hits with a sniper rifle and noone knows why.
---
The worst part is I never had this issue before free to play. People routinely showed up in full T3 reckoning gear, and worked together. Now if I see one piece of T1 reckoning gear I'm flabbergasted.
---
F
---
I know it wouldn't have made a difference but there should be a thing that if you load into a losing match, you should have full super.  Just cause.  :)
---
I've saved Saint already. The Devil's Ruin and Bastion have yet to be introduced, but what are the ritual weapons? I don't see the triumphs in this season for those requirements, which is why I'm asking.
---
I bought armors and weapons from Hawthorne. But she doesn't have everything. Where do you get the rest?

I honestly hate when these happens. I play a ton of gambit. Prime more often in all honesty, people are greedy. When i play against a braindead enemy i can go in, hammer, goldengun or daybreak them and then when they respawn kill them again. There were prime games when i went full sweat with my hammerhead and golden gun and by the end of the prime match i had 20 guardian kills. The problem? We lost. Our team couldnt keep the damage or kill an invader, so we essentially were half way by the time they melted with one last final push from their chaos reach warlock.
---
No ornament
---
Not really. Its 1000000x worse to play one game, someone plays differently so you get offended and go on reddit to make a post to whine like a small child. 
---
its sad as fuck and people defending this type of behaviour are the issue man. You are part of the issue haha literally snowflaking. Awful to see, it really is. I'd rather have a toxic life than a beta male life where all I do is complain ^^ at least then I contribute technically haha.

Nice play mate! That dodge knife to the face was badass!
---
It's in the room with the witch on the landing zone with Sloane (can't remember the name). If you go in that room go to the back of the bottom floor, not up the stairs, and then go into the hallway. In the hallway, go inside the doorway on your left. 
---
I hope this helps!

Ok Zavala

Nah....watching and actually doing the thing are two very different things.
---
Sure, doesn't matter to me
---
Forsaken first.
---
Thanks bruh
---
Max your mobility and equip a lightweight weapon like the mida multitool. That should make you fast enough.
---
Lmao, there had to be comments like this
---
nobody ever accused bungie of making good quests
---
Crucible banner reminds me of the angry silhouette meme
---
Thank you. The crucible is the only place that warlock live up to bungie expectation of "a fiery angel that fire from above". I mean a warlock that can pop Super and use only the fire blade FOR THE WHOLE  match is truly a fiery angel. And no that not mayhem mode
---
Yeah the knife is very aim assisted however shoulder charge is aimbot. Supernova gives you dmg absorption and has stupid effect range. Throwing knife still takes more time to draw and use vs a titan already sprinting with SC at the trigger. I think it is balanced. People just mad it‚Äôs 1 shot, but are the same people that literally use 1 shot cheese all the time in order to not be on the bottom of the leader board
---
There's one for a full armour set? You sure it's not just for Black Armoury gear?
---
The one I got was for doing a thing with four or might've been five pieces equipped which counted armour and guns.
---
I don't think "ironic" means what you think it means.

You don‚Äôt lose heavy when you die.

If it helps, I'm a scrub myself. But I did manage to reset my Valor thrice due to triple Valor week. Wait. That makes me an addict, not a scrub. Oh. T_T
---
The best way to get your gear up in power is to run activities like strikes. They will drop blue gear that should be a higher lever than what you are wearing. You can also do pvp if you want to get blue gear as well as some purple gear when you rank up your valor. 
---
Also, what system are you playing on? PS4, XB1 or PC?
---
You can afk the forges over night and come back to like 400 essence. Just lower your light level below 750 so you dont mess up other people actually attempting the forges
---
Let it rainnn and clear it out
---
Darn I was gonna say I would be happy to help

Have you tried going on LFG subs or websites?

bro i love this update. top tree nightstalker + 100 mobility... you can actually be invisible more often than you are visible
---
Not sure what the issue is here?  Give us some details?
---
I always make it into a little challenge of "can I finish this lost sector before the event starts", it's fun
---
If it's busted for any class.. then balance?? /s
---
Afk farm forges overnight. Power level below 750 so you dont mess up people trying to complete the forge. I've got over 1000 essence just from doing that one night last week and playing iron banner the rest of the time
---
Absolutely meme‚Äôd on
---
IT'S FUCKING STUCK!
---
/s is enough dude lol

Paid $10 for the season, completely ignored the one new activity from that $10......logic

Too real?

People must be checking raid histories or something, because every time I send out a request, it takes me 30 mins to get a single response, and then no one else.

I gave up on LFG spots after the first few failures

Can confirm, once I hit Mythic, it popped.

*double penta kill with chaos reach noises*

After the redesign in that area for a new strike. They forgot to touch the phase glass spawns
---
Drop your power level below 750 and afk farm forges over night
---
It *would* be amazing if they removed points. Too much karma farming and people worrying about saying the wrong thing
---
banshhe is the 2nd with the most badass voice in destiny

Than destiny isnt a game for people like that. Its an grinding game.
---
Sad when you think that hundred guardians kill themselves at the tower each day
---
Prime example of a huntard
---
**f o r m a t**
---
Just dropped in to say maybe you should reconsider dropping PvP. It's tough I know being on the bottom of the scoreboard. I'm the worst player ever and I used to hate PvP but my friend who got me into Destiny 2 advised me to keep at it. He was right. It made me a better player overall. It was depressing for a while getting beaten up over and over but slowly I got better. I gained skill and found myself climbing to middle of the pack and eventually placing in the top 3 steadily. Then I went into comp and started at the bottom again. But I kept at it, and this weekend I finally got my Luna's Howl. It's worth it man.
---
Read that in Inego Montoya voice.
---
Eh, that's what the Ishtar Collective is for.  :)
---
Good bot
---
Man, maybe I'm kinda paranoid, but for some reason I never entirely trusted that guy.
---
Too lame for reddit... about a game lol.
---
He was a con artist so its understandable he wouldnt be missed by everyone
---
Nah, Bungie put in things that simply can't be soloed in each raid.
---
Leviathan: Every section needs at least 4-5 people
---
Scourge: First section needs three, second section needs two, last section needs five
---
Last Wish: Last sections need five, multiple sections need &gt;3
---
Crown of Sorrows: Lol, 6 at all times, or three with the most godlike luck ever.
---
And I've seen a few vids of Garden. Five needed, easy.
---
The D1 raids were soloable, but that was because of self-rez warlocks.
---
Frickity Heck, i wasted 30 precious minutes of my life doing the Steps... oh well back to the Last word

You can redeem it until 9 pst

‚ÄúThey had us in the first half, not gonna lie‚Äù
---
I don't like how it changes the game. When I was grinding rocket kills, most others were too. So most matches 80% of both teams huddled around the heavy ammo, and the second the ammo was gotten it was shot so the person could get at least one kill (I'm guilty of that too). 
---
Therefore once you're done and maybe just want to play.... You're that person watching the 80% huddle around the heavy ammo 1 minute until spawn and not really playing the game. 
---
That happens with a lot of bungie challenges, especially crucible. I really enjoy stuff that is more related to the activity. Getting kills and such. I like being out of your comfort zone, but maybe randomized bounties for stuff like that? That way at least you don't have 90% of people doing the same quest and playing in the exact same way.
---
Warlock mains when they put on contraverse hold
---
Sexy!
---
Less things are locked behind DLC. 
---
Personally, I keep playing because I find the plain old gameplay (running around shooting guns) to be fun. If you don't like it enough, I don't think this is the type of game you could play long term like your friends.
---
Dude, I play 12 hours a day and I even AFK forged and I don‚Äôt even have enough to bake 300 yet.
---
I never imagined what he could sound like before but after the new patch I feel like they got it exactly right.
---
Tough crowd
---
Great mivie
---
ALSO! It‚Äôs a special kind of BS that before that damn quest gave you a piece of armor after completing each step so you‚Äôd have a full set when you‚Äôd finish. Now you don‚Äôt even get that. Smh
---
Who the fuck is the speaker?
---
Okay, thanks guys. Already playing more than one week. The thing is that both Forsaken and Shadowkeep are right now in Xbox store with a discount so I wanted to use the chance when it‚Äôs cheaper. Will go for forsaken probably cause it just seems more appealing to me rn.
---
Le Monarque does 180 damage in one shot, and that shot has a very large amount of bullet magnetism. It can get really annoying in any non 1v1 situation, and if you peek quickly and shoot, it‚Äôs almost impossible to get shot while you unload your 180 damage (which also lets you see them through the wall with the DOT damage numbers and delays their regen). Not saying it‚Äôs OP, just kinda cheesy.
---
are these people full of shit, then?
---
I don‚Äôt get it, I hard farmed for essence too and am at like 230 still.
---
Well one the awoken keep their territory down and having a mass guardian invasion on awoken soil would cause a big fucking panic and maybe even a war, another thing is that awoken are very protective of what happens on their soil, the only reason we aren‚Äôt on our way to fuck up variks for causing the prison break is because the awoken said it‚Äôs our problem and if you contact him we will declare war. Even though Zavala has made some bad choices (great disaster) he is able to hold back for humanity

You did get some rewards though?

I really don't understand this recent meme trend. The whole "type like english is your 2nd/3rd language" thing just seems stupid to me..  ü§î

It's not PTSD. His mind has been reset so many times that he's losing his ability to store information.

Don't u dare. Destiny does not deserve this.

Midnight exigent.
---
thanks for the carrys boys. i'm essentially a glorified backpack these days
---
That's why I say games are "dead to me". Like dark souls 3? I have trouble finding online things to do, so I gave up and stopped playing, but it still has a large player base, so I say that game is dead to me.
---
If you need a team go on an lfg or ask people on the dub

Cabal are literally grunts from Halo but Abit bigger.

---
Oh look at all those ahotgun apes downvoting i could bet that 90% of those who downvote are mindbenders scurbs that play their arc / void hunter with 100 recovery and as much mobility as possible... theres a pretty good reason why i dont lose alot of gunfights with primarys... Reason being that you cant aim for shit so u go the ahotgun approach of dodging around an crouch camping corners
---
Im by no means good in pvp i can barely hold my 1.8KDA   
---
But anyone trying to tell me that shotguns  especially mindbenders are balanced not aslong as shotgun scav or special ammo scav is a thing
---
Not Saint-14.

Not Banshee-44.

Not Ana Bray.
---
There's more, I'm just lazy.
---
Always miss out on the salt lol what was the comment?
---
Thank you, I‚Äôll have to farm one of those because that range is nasty
---
Oh no pve becoming harder because people cant spamm their izanagis 50 times? Yikes thats such a loss...
---
Ok cool I didnt know there was a sub for this, thanks
---
What do you think Gary's armor was made of?
---
I have no idea. I tried everything from farming team scorched, to AFK Forge. I‚Äôve only done Forge enough to get around ~1000 essence though. So unless they‚Äôve been farming Forge every single night when they go to sleep...
---
I might try that but I am literally afraid I will get into a team with some angry dude who will yell at me everytime I do something wrong because he has endgame studd

Happened to me a few times. At this point I hope it's a known issue.

How does one get said mask
---
It will be slower but you are going into old stuff max light with 100 handicapped season of dawning max light so 860 vs 650 or 600?  However I believe there is a cap on how overpowered you can be for it and it is a bit harder since you can't put any boosters on except the element boost.
---
i know where to see where to get them, i need to know the information that bungie doesnt give us like how much of a particular stat a mod boosts and if mods stack with each other and if there are any caps

Xur sells 1 Exotic Engram per weekend, per account (not character). This engram is the same as every other Exotic Engram in the game.
---
The Exotic Engram contains a random (non quest/raid) exotic weapon or armor piece (for the class you are on) that you have not acquired previously.
---
Once you have collected every exotic weapon, you will only receive armor pieces you have never received before. Once you fill up your exotic collection, you'll get a random duplicate armor piece with randomly rolled stats.
---
For this reason, you always want to fill up your exotic collection as quickly as possible, because the more you have acquired, the higher your chances get to obtain one you have not acquired yet.
---
Also, you always want to buy the weapon, and the armor piece for the class you are on if you have not acquired them previously. This way you can add 1-3 new exotics to your collection each weekend. There's nothing worse than purchasing the engram for 97 Legendary Shards only to get the weapon he's selling for 23 LS because you didn't already own it at some point.
---
Below the infograph in the post is a link to a list/guide that tells you every exotic weapon/armor in the game and where they come from (e.g. "Xur/Random drop").
---
If you go into a forge with like 700 power level it will only match you with other people with a low power level, so you wont mess up anyone actually doing forges for real. Just pull out the white class item from your collection that's like 20 something power and the mask from the halloween event which is 0 power, then just equip your lowest level stuff in each slot.
---
Ohh ive heard of the ishtar archives i found it hard to navigate at first but i check it out again cause i definitely wanna read up on what happened before the darkness came.
---
When will momentum control come back?
---
Get a team. It'll go a lot faster.
---
People still complain about OEM. It's *GARBAGE* don't know why people still use it..

My wife is working overnight so probably

*me, a Hunter, looking around awkwardly with my Recovery-Inteligence build*

Does this mean I am a disgrace as a Hunter now?

"You want to collect a package? Hahahaha did you get 'x' amount of kills with 'x' weapons? No? GET OUT OF HERE!!!"

Repost
---
He actually sounded legitimately frightening. Oryx didn't even lay a *finger* on how intimidating Ghaul sounded.
---
Idk man. What i understand even less is them forcing themselves to do it. If a grind isnt fun i dont do it. Its that simple lol
---
More research must be done. If I discover how this is done, I promise I will share with the community so we can get it fixed. Totally not gonna try it out first....
---
Heh, so funny story:  
---
In our old, longest running DnD campaign (ran over the course of like 6 years), we walked into so much shit that we couldn't handle so often that for our group "Plan A" became "Run away screaming like little children" and "Plan B" was pretty much "Since we can't 'Plan A' this I guess we will have to fight.". Plans "C-Z" were likely variations of "Die." and "Refer to plan A."
---
*"Halo is dead lol. CoD is dead lol. Destiny is dead lol."*
---
If you go back to the boss room it will make you join allies back in the sundial.
---
Good man!
---
I see. Not a fan of PVPin', so probably why I didn't pick up on that. Thanks for the clarification!
---
Didn't expect that
---
Looked, was not disappointed, just a lil spooked.
---
Pretty sure it can target players behind stuff. I am at the point where I play vs good players only. They hide, they know the invader spawns, they use broken shit aswell.  When  I did the first 10 Gambit games the games were a breeze. I once had a game with 21 guardian kills without even trying, now the games are brutal. You usaully know how the game will go within the first 2 banks.
---
I‚Äôm not talking about what OP did. It‚Äôs a separate bug involving Symmetry
---
Dude i see ppl like this, i drop a roast, a few f bombs and then see myself out i am not having my mood ruined just so i can get myself a sacred provenance
---
Go back to Ada-1
---
I don't even know who you are
---
Ah alr
---
So true
---
Live today...to fight another day
---
Or just get rezd idk im nobody to tell what you what to do
---
Wait what?
---
The second I found out that you need to do a shit ton to lvl your armor for gambit....I stopped having dreams of using those armorss
---
I assumed hive literally just reanimate the bodies of the dead and hence why they have skeletal frames.
---
And put that ugly fucker of an ornament off of your nighthawk
---
Oh it definitely is, I was more referring to the thought process and situational awareness
---

A lot of guardians myself included jump off the tower. I do that when I go see Zavala or Hawthorn because I'm too lazy to jump walk back
---
Played against three infinite respawn teleport hackers in one session this week in comp. Something needs to be done.
---
As much as I love the Sixth Coyote, still the only thing I have masterworked, the Dragon's Shadow is so good it's broken. With it you get a similar sprint boost to Stompees, a reload on all your weapons letting you use the melee recharge dodge, and if you are at 80+ Mobility there is maybe 1-1.5 seconds between the speed/mobility buff wearing off and you being able to doge again. After seeing a video on the synergy of some of the dawning mods I did a build that was all dawning except for the chest, which I put shotgun reserves on, and ran double shotguns. So long as there were more than, like, 3 enemies around I almost never ran out of ammo. Even better if you do "special finder" and "special scavenger" Could swap a shotty for a fusion rifle, but I am not a fan of them.
---
Honestly I just like it a bit. Reminds me of Jigsaw...
---
The only one that I can think of is Exit Strategy but it's only mediocre
---
‚ÄúWait a minute... who *are* you?‚Äù
---
Double reload doge is broken with heavy. Use to use Sixth Coyote to lot me spam rockets. Good times.
---
I've had some good runs with Exit Strategy.
---
ey  
---
i got kicked out after getting the ball :c
---
Having your little brother do it on his Hunter character then get it from the exotic collection.
---
OMG ..... 2ND BEST TITAN EVER! Come on people... how can you forget that it was I who made him who he is...?!?!?1
---
If the error you're encountering is "cannot read game content" try launching steam mini library, this is the only fix that worked for me.
---
Not everything Fenchurch sends is safe to sell
---
Skybox porn
---
I already have it from last season
---
I think its mainly a pc thing. I havent heard about it on console.
---
It‚Äôs called the vanguard dare set, eververse set from black armory I‚Äôm pretty sure, may or may not come back as a silver purchase later
---
Lol this is peak reddit.
---
Hunter main, you're right.  But as someone fairly okay at this game, the biggest problem I see is people not retreating from fights they're going to lose, and that's all classes.
---
It drops gear 2 levels higher than you base level....that way you can keep increasing above the soft cap...
---
Give an example.
---
Well, that was very high paced. Well done.
---
I mean. Everyone is a blueberry, unless they are in your fireteam
---
Im the guy in the clip. For your viewing pleasure, here is another one of the same cheater the game before.

fuck salad-in

Well at least he's educated
---
They beat the shit out of thrall until they become big and angry.  Pretty much the hulk but no gamma rays needed.
---
As a hunter I am offended
---
Random drop.
---
Ok. Time to grind
---
Lol I play as a hunter as well. Hunter life beat life
---
It was a burst fire sidearm, so the exotic perk was if you reload after a kill then the next burst was 2-3 times longer and more damage. It was basically the first iteration of what is now kill clip, with the additional longer burst. It may have had some additional stability or accuracy perks along with it but I can‚Äôt remember. It was nasty in the crucible because you pretty much melt anyone you hit with the extra burst shot. Reload rinse repeat, if you got on a roll with it you couldn‚Äôt be stopped. It was also one of my favorite weapons. Mostly great for PvP but still could be used in pve, just a lot of reloading to get best use out of it.
---
True art.
---
Helmet stays on.
---
So yeah, it seems certain speeders... aka the Otherside... are pintos in disguise on that map... 
---
* Hit the edge on the first jump? BOOM!
---
* Hit droop down in that tunnel as in the video? BOOM!
---
* Pull out your speeder? BOOM!
---
This is pretty much the truth. All hive start as thralls and build themselves up with violence and become bigger and stronger. They morph at a certain point which determines their "class" knight wizard etc. Theyre all just corpses anyway like most things in Destiny.
---
I have about every exotic even the raid ones and still don't have this my cousin got it from crucible though. Ur best bets xur engrams or farming 950 nightfall or just get lucky
---
Sounds cool
---
Ok thank you
---
I find it interesting people call it boring yet I am having such a blast with it and I may actually commit a lot of time and money into it.

Iron must be a modifier, it prevents enemies from flinching allowing him to pull you in no matter how much you shoot him.
---
Will be playing probably.
---
It grows with them iirc. They all start as thralls and build up through violence. They just keep transforming and morphing.
---
It's not even people calling it boring. Slide down to the bottom of comment sections on nearly anything, YouTube, instagram, reddit, etc. And theres always some asshat saying "this game is dead"
---
Seeing this with your own eyes is atleast funny, because you know its a cheat. You know what is not funny? Low.
---
I‚Äôve seen lots of folks run the Hecuba in scourge. Lol it‚Äôs never one i I knew to blew up. We‚Äôve had some interesting moments out of that ordeal last week including a champion hobgoblin being on ground level and teleporting way high up when his shield would pop up for us to break. It was interesting.
---
Used the rocket launcher wardcliffs coil for mine felt pretty easy I did it in 4 games!
---
Pay attention to their mote bar. When you see they have enough to open a portal, bank. Let them invade, get more motes.

Mine is a metallic silver/bronze and it looks really cool.

I don't think It's because of that.
---
Pretty sure they put it into slowmo so we could see the hive face and that‚Äôs not actually how his game looks.
---
rampage spec, since it permits you having killclip and rampage up at the same time quite easily!
---
usually 2 taps in PVP (when both dmg perks are active) and deletes in PVE.
---
Do all 3 weapons machine gun, bow, sniper (tatara gaze not izanagis)
---
I love me some Titanfall 2....or are you talking team fortress?
---
Fuck you
---
but TitanSlayer420 decided it was a good idea.
---
Well that's a bit harsh now isn't it
---
Depends if you're quickscoping or not. I prefer high sensitivity myself, I'm more used to snapshots from playing CoD 2&amp;4 for nearly a decade. Destiny is a different game entirely. Peer-to-Peer connection fuckery and bullet magnetism(and age) have killed any drive to tryhard.
---
Yeah, last I checked, the as long as you don't outright hinder the Vanguard on something, they leave you alone, and while your Ghost might nag you, there really isn't anything about being a guardian that forces you onto a side of things. 
---
I mean Hell, look at Drifter. The man does shady shit all the time, is responsible for many, many deaths of innocents and guardians alike, and yet he's still risen and kicking. The man even *hates* ghosts and regularly berates his, but he's still able to be rezzed.
---
or when theres 3 blockers on your bank on gambit prime and you teammates are killing the normal enemies instead.
---
I use 0.6 sens with 250 dpi on my mouse and I have a pretty high sniping accuracy... But it's all down to preference. Pick something different if you're not liking your current settings and practice with it until you get something that clicks c:

If you wait long enough, you can see Jupiter disappear from there and reappear behind you.

Played against him while grinding bro 5500 this season,  he was doing carries, we watched the stream, he‚Äôs a good player, they lost only bc the guys he was carrying weren‚Äôt good at all.
---
I jump because it fun
---
Honestly worth it! I threw on Calus' Selected shader on it and it looks awesome!
---
All the classes are beginner friendly IMO, Hunters are a bit more difficult to master. Their Jump is just top tier, IMO
---
Take note bungie
---
Mine is all white with red glow and eyes. Simple dude
---
Even Ana wasn't sure she did the right thing by reactivating Rasputin. Osiris and Saint-14 went after threats that were clearly defined: the Vex and the Fallen. Ana didn't even know that the Hive threatened Rasputin until she found the Bray facility. She always just assumed that Rasputin would help humanity simply because she was a Bray. And to be frank, I don't think Rasputin would have helped us if it wasn't for it's own self-preservation. 
---
Not to mention that both Saint-14 and Osiris were very clear about what they were going to do. Ana faked her death.
---
theyre the best class but the hardest class to master. the other classes are a little worse but easier to be decent with so its up to you.
---
Not really, there are weapons that can two tap or even one shot you if you're below tier 5 resiliance, you should always aim for at least tier 5 resiliance for pvp, it's recovery that is useless in pvp, for pve it's a whole different story.
---
I‚Äôm guessing Hunter bias.
---
I got mine grinding blind well. Just keep at it and may RNGesus bless you
---
Go check out https://www.ishtar-collective.net/

It's fantastic.

Bank those Barons to summon a dark Uldren!
---
just check out LFG app on the xbox (if youre on xbox) there are always folks looking to run it!

"Hey, you finished that long Symmetry grind for the catalyst? 
---
Here it is but you need to grind out a bunch more kills before you use it."
---
What weapons are those?
---
You'll unfortunately need to to a higher level first or you'll have a bad time
---
You should check out r/sharditkeepit for all your godroll questions and stuff related to weapon rolls! Good place for info! :)
---
If you are exotic hunting I'd stick to 950-980 Nightfalls
---
I'm really not sure because I highly doubt it ever did speak to him since even the Ghosts don't know why they're here
---
Still not fixed and it‚Äôs the 31st
---
You'll need a full fireteam to complete them first
---
"...I said, 'I speak for the Traveler'. I never said the Traveler spoke to me."
---
i don‚Äôt, his words are confirmed in lore. the mask he wears amplifies the Traveler‚Äôs ‚Äòsignal‚Äô. if he was lying, then every Speaker before him was lying, and every single one also somehow managed to outsmart people like Ikora Rey.
---
i also don‚Äôt think you need to be condescending about this. i believe we can discuss differing opinions in a civil manner.
---
Actually the pvp and pve samdboxes have been separated for over a year now, bungie very clearly makes it known on any changes what the equipment does damage/perk wise with separate pvp and pve statements
---
Glad when I searched for destiny 2 on reddit this was the first sub that came up.
---
Um 1. Invading right away is great. U stop them from taking out their envoys. U stop them from beginning to damage their primeval, and u kill all four of them just to troll. And 2 stealing and dying with heavy really doesn't matter, cuz u keep it. But all other things are 100% true
---
Not all hunters are toxic, like any class. But your tag is...
---
At least its not as bad as the Star Wars Holiday special...they I rank above the Disney films.
---
Thats because this sub is mostly crayon eaters. We tend to be much more mellow.
---
I zoomed in to check 4head
---
They won't nerf my crutch tho, fighting lion will always reign supreme
---
Don‚Äôt forget bombardiers
---
I rather crayon eaters than toxic salty hunters
---
Indeed
---
Go home knight ur drunk
---
Crayon eaters are marginally better than salty and toxic hunters that always want their way.
---
Now that ape has.... escaped
---
If you want maximum big dick energy while slapping the meta upside the head, throw on actium war rig and sweet business
---
So a combo of Release the Wolves and Kill Clip.
---
Do heroic it's guaranteed drop on your first completion per character then a chance after that.
---
That's nothing, played a comp game where the enemies had a combined total of more than 100k
---
I have to agree
---
I do, often
---
Keep them we'll get a new use for the currency in February(Empyrean Restoration/restore the light house)
---
I believe it was
---
The bounties, and from what i hear there is a quest later that will ask for a lot.
---
Believe in yourself
---
So does a quickdraw shotgun ;)
---
So should I just keep doing the easy saint bounties every day for the quest?
---
Lol no it doesn't. Chaperone has a further range...but you gotta actually aim the chaperone...
---
*flexes in chad fighting lion * "Oh, yeah. It definitely is possible"
---
Yes, plus it is xp for the season pass
---
Wishender's dps is crazy broken right now. Taking it into the dungeon will dramatically make it easier for solo runs
---
There's a hidden triumph that from data mining says it will require about 5k of the fuckers
---
Bad writing will do that.
