I got my we ran out of medals on a warlock, I use transverses, shotgun hand cannon and top tree stormtrance with arc bolt. Or get away artist instead of trans steps

---
---
Ooooh ok i got it now XD
---
They need bad luck protection across the board for activity specific exotics. If a certain amount of completions is reached, say 20, the the following completion should guarantee it. Especially for raids. I’ve seen that people have done the maximum amount of possible completions to date for Last Wish and STILL haven’t gotten 1k Voices yet. I’d say that’s absurd but I don’t even think that word is good enough.
---
Both for the same reason:  People are pathetic and make it not worth it.

It’s pretty trash with one two tbh. The handling is gawd awful so you don’t get enough time to get the second punch off. Definitely the best pvp shotgun imo though.
---
I thought it said kid. Lol
---
I think kill clip/explosive is ideal, but then again, idk what moving target does actually, so...
---
The warlock arc subclass is really good for close combat when surrounded by tons of enemies because it chains. You just shoot the lighting and you’re guaranteed to kill multiple targets at once.
---
The best part of a reset.
---
The items you can buy for dust are getting rotated.
---
Literally a big banner popped up in game stating all in game purchases would be useless as of today.
---
Gotcha, thanks!
---
This must be a PC thing because this rarely ever happens on console
---
Yeah and the middle tree is amazing dps...it’s just so difficult to choose a main
---
I’d probably get a bunch of ghost pins if I had a reliable group to trade with

Asher is definitely going to steal your kids in the middle of the night. Damn that pedostache

Damn I guess what I said doesn’t apply then. 
---
Also you could have bought it last night too.🥳
---
buff rate was only for 1k not anarchy
---
Exactly
---
Good one bro, this comment slaps.
---
You are part of the problem
---
Dont always go by the usual Meta that every player uses. Just play the game and keep aquiring new items, and just keep testing everything out and find a build that best suits you and your playstyle. But I def suggest get the Black Armory done and unlocking the Forges. The weapons you can forge are very good and alot of the Curated ones you can get (from Powerful Frames) have amazing rolls.
---
HAHAHAHA how apply not?? you lifeless mean man talk bad liberal no?
---
Thanks for the info :)
---
sorry :(
---
Lol it was to be expected. Im even running fighting lion, all i need is about 30 more multi kills then i can get the mountaintop all in 1 day. Just very annoying and irritating trying to get multikills.
---
NP bro. Always down to help a newcomer to Destiny!
---
Oh nice! Thank you very much for the info!
---
I had the most luck running nightstalker with tether to get double kills with fighting lion or militias birthright a couple times per round. And then camp heavy and try and flank teams. Not always fun but you’ll get better and better at it.
---
Are you on PC, PS or Xbox?
---
It’s not that nobody understands how they work it’s just that there is no reason to when you’re constantly swapping gear just trying to reach max light.
---
What kind of coffee?
---
Mine is just a pack mule anyway
---
Once you get used to it, you start hating any other leg armor pieces than stompees. Jumping becomes very hard without them
---
Yup, definitely did that!
---
I am always taking a look at how much of a piece of art this game is. Sentence structure isn’t quite right here but you get my gist.
---
Thats true. I personally just get irritated if my armor never matches lmao
---
Dude you forgot the NSFW flair
---
When you use cross save, all progress made on that account will persist across platforms. However, there is no account merging, so there's no way to combine your PC and console accounts, you can only use one at a time. So you can definitely play on your console account on both PC and console and keep all the same items and progress, but it will not affect your existing PC account. 
---
Note that DLC purchases are (mostly) platform specific! You won't be able to do any DLC specific activities if you don't own the DLC on that platform.
---
&gt;Shadowkeep will be a la carte and will not include any of the previous DLC unless I buy the deluxe edition
---
The deluxe edition includes future DLC after Shadowkeep, it does not include any previous content. [A longer post I made explaining DLC.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cyb7pc/how_dlc_works_in_destiny_2/)
---
&gt;Will I be able to progress to the higher levels by skipping the season pass content and just purchasing the new expansion or will I hit walls that will require I go back and get the previous expansions?
---
Don't worry about level, think of DLCs in terms of the activities they add, that is really what you are buying and playing them for. 
---
&gt;Is there content that is worth playing through between Forsaken and Shadowkeep?
---
Worth is subjective, it depends how often you play. The annual pass, the content in between Forsaken and Shadowkeep, does not add any planets or campaigns, it's a ton of side quests, some small matchmade game modes, and a couple of raids.
---
It’s really not that annoying after two nerfs and a half way decent team trying to group up can easily defeat OEM titans plus they don’t get strong till later in the match once they get kills
---
My work here is done.
---

---
Forsaken will be free when first light drop, on steam
---
Excellent! Upvote for you! You made me laugh! Plus, you need to F off with that DRB
---
You're wasting your time making this post.
---
Which one?
---
I think when you do the rumble they count as QP as well.
---
so you never played blind well i guess
---
Also, yes you have to get to that set for it to count. It retroactived for the season you're in.
---
I found this when looking it up couple months ago 
---
When your PS4 downloads a game update, it's only downloading the changes to the game. This might sound obvious, but it means the initial download is faster, as you don't have to download the updated version of the game itself
---
your PS4 has downloaded the update file. It then needs to install it, and it does this by basically copying the whole game file, and adds the patch in the process. Long story short, this process helps to prevent file corruption.
---
The speed of the procedure will vary from game to game. Some games on PS4 aren't even 1GB in size, so the copying process will be quite speedy. However, many of the more popular games are dozens of gigabytes. The larger the original game size, the longer it's going to take for your PS4 to complete the copying process.
---
Link to website: http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/08/guide_ps4_copying_update_files_-_why_does_it_take_so_long
---
That’s freaking awesome dude! How long did it take?
---
I’m just gonna step back let a homie get some
---
If so, that would be really convenient.
---
I do play blind well but the amount of orbs generated in the blind well is not near the amount I see in EP.
---
Can I be more like them?
---
Is the raid group your friends or ransoms? Honestly while I agree drops need to be fixed, there's no harm in rubbing it in a little if they're your friends - good thing to have a laugh about haha
---
In D1 after I got my first Gjallarhorn to drop (which took well over a year), they started dropping from _everything_, so I used to send videos of me dismantling them to my friend who didn't have it yet just to tease him 😂
---
As long as I'm the snowflake that causes the avalanche.

Top tree Dawnblade is pretty balanced considering its so short, bottom tree is the infinite one. Even then it requires aim and is not that hard to headshot. It's broken in QP but that's because QP doesn't even try to be a balanced game mode. In a well matched comp lobby I don't think any warlock supers can solo teams like spectral or striker can.
---
This is severely upsetting to look at

No, this is a well know thing, and it's intentional, not a bug.

M&amp;K has less recoil, but less vertical recoil, because it is in general, harder to learn/control.

Controller has more recoil, but more vertical for better use with the basic nature of joysticks.

Do some research on Google man.
---
0.9 pvp kd after 1,000 hours played? Holy shit you’re bad. Like you have a below average IQ relative to dogs bad. Like Jesus Christ find a new game to play bad. Like use lunafactions over Phoenix protocol bad.
---
What's the community challenge I haven't been on in over a week or 2
---
Why post this? No hunter is gonna see this and immediately change their mind.
---
Also you're wrong. Hunter orbs generate in large part when the kills of tethered targets occur. So by tethering en route to the point, it sets up, and generates the orbs. Not mention that while moving point to point, you are most vulnerable to being pushed around/off the bridge, a tether stuns/silances them and stops that.
---
I was doing some other stuff on Io when the event came up, are you killing the knight? I did and it at least seemed to work normally.
---
Lol man sorry that I work and pay bills like a normal person. Besides, PvP isn't my strong suit. Plus, I don't like Dawnblade. I mainly use Voidwalker. But I'm not here for an ego boost. I use what I use for my play style. Don't like it, oh well. I'm not losing sleep. And KD doesn't mean anything to me. So...yeah. Still, 1000 hours played is a milestone. Gonna hit 2000 before it's all over. 
---
Anyways, pleasure talking with you. See you on the Moon my friend. May the flames guide thee.
---
Plus the masterwork roll on mindbenders has opening shot which is crazy in crusible.
---
Is it just a regular knight or some boss knight? I’m thinking that’s what I may be missing and just never realized I was killing him before when it opened
---
No hunter plays reckoning.
---
There is a set drop for you first gambit reset, it has a decent set roll.
---
Play a bunch of gambit basically.
---
I can drop at the end of games, rank ups, and turning in Drifter's weekly bounty for nornal gambit.
---
There are two weeks of increased infamy coming up one is next week the other is the last week of season of opulence.
---
I've tried a lot! Whats the timing?
---
Alright thanks! But then is there any of those I should prioritize before another? I haven’t kept up with the updates so I don’t really know what’s good or not.
---
Apparently you have to do a nightfall to get the rewards. I have no friends to do it with.
---
Not related
---
PC, Sadly. Albeit, thank you for offering.
---
I never told you to use another exotic nor tried to force you, not sure where you gathered that from in my last reply. I simply stated you came off as a noob the way you worded your comment and that’s why you got a lot of replies calling you out. That’s literally all I pointed out. You literally said “not sure why I’m getting so much hate” and I tried to explain why. You don’t need supers up faster unless your playing solo. Most encounters are 1 phased at this point and time in the game hence why people hold Lunafactions in high regard, hence why they need a nerf because they trivialize content. But since you want to be a defensive little douche, you can shut the fuck up. How about you go fuck yourself on the moon and if I knew your ingame tag I’d teabag every chance I get. Toxic assholes like you are what’s wrong with this game. Fucking 5 year vet lol, more like toxic vet.
---
I'm not sure, I don't have a pic or video.
---
I think it was someone else's boss fight.
---
Or a unicycle is a tricycle without training wheels. Bruh, I think we're on to something.
---
Honestly, I don't even care about the Menagerie rewards increase considering that I have the god rolls that I want, the only reason I'd do it is to get more shards from dismantling it all but I have been sitting on massive stacks of Vanguard and Crucible tokens that I'm turning in when Shadowkeep drops so it doesn't really effect me
---
I've got a seemingly endless amount of stuff to do. I took a short break and I'm having blast personally
---
But yeah if you're not having fun.. Don't play.. It's not a job man
---
I got 18 Kelvin from it!!! Thanks a lot bro I really appreciate u rn 👍
---
With the amount of worthless grinding we do for pretty much nothing, sure seems like it. At least at work I get paid. There’s endless things to do, what I’m saying is, none of it is worth it. If it doesnt reward something game breaking or an exotic, why should I care
---
*chambers shotgun, Machine Gun, + Trace Rifle* lets do it.
---
Why does it always come down to pvp being broken?
---
I understood that reference
---
Just do one nightfall. It helps the community out and that's what the purpose is, everyone working together, not necessarily for your own personal rewards.
---
Doent really answers the question
---
Indeed.
---
We've stepped into war with the SPAGHETT
---
I gave up with gambit after going through countless games of people using some sort of AFK bot
---
I mean technically it does "Its being sent to mars", "How?", "NASA". For more clarification, by a rocket.
---
Just had a few rounds like this too, infuriating how nothing is ever done against this shit
---
Heck yea
---
What's funny is that communism has a problem with invaders ruining it too lol
---
In terms of Shaders that would be good for making a Yang-looking Titan (huge fan of the show by the way), I’d recommend... Desert of Gold (Eververse, matches most of her palette), Goldleaf (Menagerie, a good looking yellow), Gambit Blackguard and Gambit Duds (Gambit, *perfect* for Yang’s season 4 outfit with all the leathery brown she has going on), and... of course... Bumblebee (Eververse, most popular shader where yellow is the main color)
---
Alright alright alright, let's see what we got
---
i am extremely uncomfortable
---
Why would you have two titans?
---
Yes. And hey, did they mention if that bump in menagerie chests will have a duration, or persist after shadowkeep? Because if so... that will hands down be the best way to get armor 2.0 sets that have an element affinity of your choosing.
---
Yea
---
I think they're still committed to one exotic armor piece per player (and some of the notes I've read recently suggest that they've focused on limiting the ways buffs will stack anyhow).    
---
My sense is that Bungie took to heart the complaint that Titans didn't have go-to roles in high-level PvE (in the same way that a Hunter with tether or Celestial Nighthawk or a Warlock with Well or Lunafactions might).  This seems like a shift that makes one class more desirable by making another considerably less so.  And I can't recall this level of simple redundancy in Destiny:  Warlocks now have two pieces of gear that are (assuming Lunafactions are not off the charts fast) fractionally better than enhanced loader perks.  The number of viable exotics in PvE (much less Warlock viability in PvP, which Bungie has all but ignored) has gotten smaller and smaller.
---
Report them, bungie perma bans gambit afkers, been seeing post a lil while back from people crying that they got a perma ban instead of a temp lol
---
Impressive.

---
I'm hoping to get the shotgun, then all I have to do is work on the armor! That seems like it will be hard one, can we get more than one cache key per week?
---
No. If they were it'd be something really dumb like Boaty McBoat
---
That's really strange honestly I would  figure blizzard would want to milk as much money as they can before they couldn't sell it anymore
---
I struggled for nothing... didn’t had time to look into this quest 😭
---
Ah taken from D1 taken King I see, this still gives me PTSD
---
I think we're on the same page, but as a Warlock main it seems to me more finicky the longer I look.
---
I can envision a bit of doubling (as could be the case with the new Lunafaction boots and Enhanced \_\_\_ Loaders, for example), but that's still a major shift away from the functionality of the boots and leaves us with entirely redundant class reload-speed exotics.  
---
In addition to nerfing the Well in terms of regen, which they already did to make Warlocks dependent on other classes generating orbs for them, the logical thing to do would be to reduce the duration or the strength of the damage buff.  But in my experience of the Well that's only a sliver of the problem.  If I'm running a Nightfall, for instance, drop my Well, and a Hunter with Celestial Nighthawk one-shots Sedia in the Corrupted Nightfall in less than three seconds, is the Well the issue?  Or if I'm on Tier 3 Reckoning and I can drop Wells all the way up the bridge because Tethered thralls are giving us a surplus of orbs (and because I've devoted my exotic slot to Phoenix Protocol), is the Well the issue?  (Especially if a Minotaur stomp kills half the fireteam.)  Raids are a different beast, for sure, but in plenty of PvE, PvP, and PvPvE, the Well is of limited utility. 
---
It feels the same for Lunafaction Boots; if the power is out of line reduce the damage or the duration, don't change its essential nature.  Sure there are other exotics, but I think what we've seen is a heavy finger on the nerfing trigger when it comes to the Warlock standbys.  I remember when Spectral Blades and Nova Warp were nerfed at the same time; Nova Warp use decreased after that by about 75%, but Spectral Blades remains all but omnipresent.  The go-to Warlock super regen exotics (central for Well and Nova Bomb) are much less used as well.  I can devise a niche build or a synergy build for any given activity, but they can be chessed out in PvP and they will depend on the choices of other classes in PvE.  I think it's cool that Bungie wants player to think through coordination a little differently, but if it just translates into a need for multiple Warlocks running Grace they've sort of defeated the purpose.
---
Yes there is. I’m on mobile atm but google could help ya
---
If you haven’t killed Atheon, Crota, Oryx, or Aksis you have no say in this or ever stepped in a d1 raid you have no say in this matter 😂😂
---
Laughs in Xol
---
Yeah, this should be a 30 day ban for first offence, sharp increase for repeat offenders IMO.
---
Why’s your high score on the nightfall?
---
it's pretty much like the huckleberry but clears much faster once you have the proc (after a kill with any weapon). has to reload but much faster than your usual gun, barely noticeable if you have the proc (after a kill with this weapon)
---
also doesn't take up the "exotic slot"... and/but it takes up the  energy slot (void, so good for many activites since void shields seem most prominent) - and, personally, i have way much more energy weapons than kinetic that i like to use.
---
i like the recluse and it plays very similar to huckleberry, a bit better i'd say even - but it makes weaponchoice even harder ;)
---
Yes, at the character selection screen there’s an option to re watch it
---
And you are right, but 5500in comp is 5500 in comp
---
That's pretty much every fusion rifle in Crucible.
---
Below the character select screen is a small button you can press to view it.
---
I’d say more so OEM and Recluse.
---
Ok good information. So im not wasting time with these. But is there any better places to farm now
---
PS4's do it differently. Apparently it downloads the copy, then creates a new back up copy before patching the game. It's more secure as if the data corrupts you can get the original back, but it takes so much longer. like 20/30 mins which is very frustrating. 
---
I've learnt to turn the console on and let it do it's thing while I do something else.
---
Thank you, now make it special again and we have a talk

30 day for the first ban is a bit steep cuz people do have life's they get kicked for inactivity and stuff like that yes ik these guys are afk farming but still it would affect others outside of them

---
What community challenge
---
DMG is going to be posting daily updates on twitter
---
He was a garbo character in D2
---
kill the entire enemy team before any of them respawn
---
Yup funnest thing you can do in the game which is what made d1 so great but they failed at recreating the fun aspect into d2 raids
---
D2 plep hear, what is the third one besides last word and Thorn?
---
I think due to it being an automation tool/bot playing the game
---
Because Whisper bypasses the reload requirement while everything else doesn't anymore
---
I don't think it should because your only using it to buy stuff and it won't give you a major advantage.
---
Negative, that pos is collecting dust in the vault where it belongs.
---
The only fusion that takes skill is Arbalest.
---
Because autoreload in a well made Whisper's perk mostly useless. Now, if you hit your crits, Whisper will be the weapon you don't have to reload.
---
I’m not talking about banning people for going AFK for a few minutes. I mean people who are running jump macros to circumvent the AFK timeout and AFK for hours at a time, even overnight in some cases.
---
Not if you miss a precision shot or the game just doesn’t count it, which isn’t an issue at all with Luna the way it is now since Whisper doesn’t pull from thin air anymore.
---
What exactly is the nerf? I didn't know they ever explicitly said what was happening.
---
The highscore Doesnt really matter
---
I think it technically could, and I've read that Destiny 2 can tell if you are running other programs while playing. It doesn't seem like it should, because you're not impacting anyone else's experience, but I honestly wouldn't chance it if it was me.
---
Correct me if I’m wrong, but all the Whisper perk does is refill the magazine, right? It pulls from reserves, so autoreload making the perk useless doesn’t mean anything. You didn’t have to hit your crits. Now you have to. That’s a nerf.
---
Happy irl cakeday
---
[*Watch out watch out watch out!*](https://youtu.be/mFElmSV87pg)
---
Cayde's character in d2 was ruined and I'm glad they got rid of him
---
Yes, but the autoreload nerf hits everything. Whisper provides a way to avoid it, so it stands out relatively to the rest, that's what everybody means in this thread.
---
, muthafucka.
---
Haha i guess i was close indeed
---
That's the tough one, finding one with enough people. Oh well, it's no biggie.
---
I mean it's ok *laughs in chaperone*
---
Valus Ta’aurc
---
I see. I didn’t realize everyone else was talking about it relative to other guns - in that case, yeah, I guess Whisper got nerfed less than other guns did since you don’t always have to reload it.
---
I think warlocks are the hardest class to play with for PVP but once you master all their abilities they are pretty powerful.
---
Ok
---
It's probably worth noting that izanagis burden is going to be much more powerful, since the enhanced reload speed will let it reload/combine its shots faster.
---
me and my friend both got it first try, one of the people we were doing the run with chose our chest and we both got it first try
---
And that's exactly why your middle tree Arcstrider lasts 5 seconds, and mine lasts 20. If you deflect supers with it, it's gonna take a huge chunk of your super bar with it.
---
Thoughts?
---
Just hold down reload as you fire....immediately combines the mag so you can chain honed edge shots.  You're welcome.
---
Doing 100K's as I have seen in plenty of how-to's
---
Just used up my RNG luck.
---
Oh that nightmare lol
---
Wow really, I’ve been trying to use it but it just doesn’t kill anything, even direct hits seem to leave them with like 5 hp then I’m stuck in a painfully long reload animation and get killed lol.
---
It really looks like I did ngl
---
I'm not sure what you're implying lol
---
And I still don't have it

You might be able to get it in Menagerie if you don't like Gambit.

The only stuff I preorder is destiny content since I’ve bought everything for destiny since D1 launched. But everyday I’m being disappointed over and over by Bungies decisions especially with armour designs. So I think I’m done with destiny. It’s sad but hey at least I’ve got D1
---
No... http://imgur.com/gallery/MZCWy0r the icon on the masterwork for weapons.

Would annual pass content still be available after shadowkeep drops? For example, will I still be able to complete the last word quest if I haven’t finished when shadowkeep comes around?
---
That's bs. The entire point of Rally Barricade was auto reload.

NICE

Saw it yesterday on PS store for i think $34.95 usd iirc.  Destiny New Light will launch Oct 1st with Shadowkeep.  New Light is free and includes the vast majority of year 1 and 2.  Also im sure Gamestop will have it for under $20 usd.

It's the fatebringer of destiny 2!

I'd like to think they're dead guardians. If it they're really the Darkness or the Veil, i'd be disappointed. But that's just me tho 👽

It’s called power creep and it’s not healthy for the game. While I agree if they nerf an Arguably OP exotic, they need to buff the shit ones for SURE 100 percent
---
Its definately annoying getting to 13k and losing your winstreak, simply because you team consists of afk's.
---
Makes sense. But at the same time, Bungie did say the items from the seasons will be moved to general loot pool. They will be harder to obtain, but they will still retrievable. Much like Thunderlord and Arbalest, they are harder to get now, but they are obtainable.
---
Now Horror Story on the other hand, you can't get that anymore.
---
I literally just uninstalled the game last night for the second time. Sorry Cayde, I just can't with the game anymore.
---
do to some designs that these shadow beings have I've speculated that these are the dead guardians crota killed in that battle for the moon in the lore.

Just got my redrix and working on mt but I'm starting a new job today so i have no idea when I'll actually finish lol
---
Note to self - finish Malfeasance quest on PC ;)
---
Yeah, we are basically being punished for getting to legend properly, but the afks didn't do anything for it, and we can't do anything about it.
---
What’s your light?  If your high enough light and have the Menagerie/Chalice unlocked, I’d suggest slotting the runes necessary for a range MW Trust and roll it until you get the roll you want.  I use a drop mag/dragonfly/rampage trust in crucible that is just filthy.  Slapped a dragonfly spec on it and this past Iron Banner caused plenty of groups capping points to regret standing so close to each other.
---
Replace mountaintop with truth and hammerhead and there ya go

Everytime I start wanting to get back into Destint I see shit like this and just think,

“Nah, that’s too much effort.”

Hell yeah dude that’s my favorite exotic!
---
To die to. :(

I actually finished the last step in that match . The wonders of cross save .

I scrapped every sniper i got which didn't have dragonfly in d1...from house of wolves to d2 forsaken. Yes i am stupid
---
I don't think Reckoning is going away. I'm talking about seasons going forward. But let's use the Reckoning as an example. Let's say season of the Drifter launched again. All the items with it, and the activity will leave when the season ends. But the items themselves will/might be moved into the general loot pool, but will be harder to obtain. But there will be a story reason for the Reckoning disappearing. Does that make sense?
---
We got nothing! The scumbag is now  one of us!  Karma is a harsh mistress.
---
When my clan wasn't dead I managed to squeeze a few raids in and had a blast. The biggest issue isn't that they're not fun, it's that you have to have a team of 6, and for the longer raids hours to commit to constant gaming (at least until your team is experienced).
---
Menagerie is sort of raid lite with matchmaking and it seems like people are always doing it. Personally, it's the most fun PvE content available to me right now (not having a lot of free time or an active clan). I'd love to see more of that, and if they reused future raid assets and the less coordination demanding mechanics (I.E. those that don't require mic coordination) to create it they'd get a lot more mileage for their trouble.

Wait, what is this about Polaris Lance?  Please enlighten me as I love the gun but felt that scouts were a bit under powered these days.
---
Console.. Pc 2 low
---
True, but RNG left for year 3 (except for husk of the pit which had very high drop rates from ogres and high ranked hive). Also you can’t just say it was RNG when players had to progress through a quest. Granted it’s not just a quest but it’s not just RNG. It’s a hybrid of both

Oh that’s crazy... thanks for the info lol
---
I see you found Gambit
---
Hardly happens anymore in D2's system.
---
Yeah but hunters have beetle armour and it’s just too good to pass up the chance
---
What do they get from doing this? All of the worthwhile Gambit bounties/quests/objectives I've worked on benefit from actually playing and winning games. It's probably faster as well. The objectives that only require you to be there just reward you with Synths and Infamy....I don't get it.

indeed
---
This just made me think of something. So when Guardians are resurrected for the first time, they aren’t supposed to know their original past life. Were the Exo’s created before Guardians were created or after? I’d assume before because I don’t think any Guardian would willingly go through the long, slow, whisper or any of the nonsense of becoming an Exo. Wouldn’t it be forced upon you? 
---
Also, even if they were created after, I’d assume their Ghosts would be able to give them the knowledge that they may have been missing prior to the reset of their numbers. 
---
So this brings up my next question. If Exos were created BEFORE Guardians, how would they even know their reset count if they cannot recall who they were prior to being a Guardian?
---
WRRYYYYYYYYYYYYY
---
in the video you provided they are killing the primevil with 3 stacks of primevil slayer buff.  we usually melt at 2 stacks whether we have done any damage on the 1st phase or not. I think we're at cross purposes, I was just checking you knew you can't kill it at the 1st damage phase - although you can take it to 33% of it's health where it goes immune (we usually do this 1st phase). tractor/mp not needed (but helps), just need spike nades and luna well
---
Thank you!

How long is this on for?

Womp womp. I suppose lol.

Yeah you straight up replied to my comment... you started this entire conversation, don’t get mad if I call you out on something I don’t agree with. You literally “came over here,” I think that’s more straight up annoying.
---
Yessss let the theory spin
---
What if...
---
There’s also one in Volundr Forge. It’s in the abyss and no matter what you die before it’s scanned
---
Don’t get mad just because I’m calling you out on something I don’t think is right, maybe we play on different platforms, probably different glories in comp too, probably both, grow up.

Yes. Thankyou i am now going to change my gamertag to that and nake my titan look like that.

---
Yeah, because I think that there’s a decent number of people who are gonna see the jerk about the Whisper being meta again and assume it’s because it’s stronger than it used to be. I think it’s important to look at both aspects - strength relative to other guns (which is usually what defines the meta) and strength relative to its past self (which doesn’t have any bearing on the meta but can impact how someone feels when they use the gun).
---
I’m mad about this but I’m upvoting because it looks clean
---
GG's and gl on the NF. I'm having a problem with double kills not counting. It's all I have left, and sometimes they just don't count.
---
Eh idk about avenged, I mean the dude is alive so not too much we can do about it
---
Anthem gameplay is light years better than Destiny's. And Destiny on console has ancient controller options, straight out of the first Halo from 2001. Yeah, load that game up and try to find different controller options.
---
If you guys dont have a swarm with spike nades check in your collection for a warmind grenade launcher called courageous something. Same archetype as swarm and it has spike grenades.

---
Idk if it's just me but using a hunter for the jump puzzles isn't that hard but i always seem to screw it up at some point(probably the pressure of doing it that fast😂) but yeah I could never solo it.
---
Give them  Valus Ta’aurc’s ID. That way maybe the alien's will punch through the defenses of the Siege Dancers on that Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon, break their grip of Freehold, and if we're lucky  we won't get into a war with the Cabal on Mars. Unless we want it.
---
I walked out of JB Hifi with my new Nacon Unlimited and the salesman deadset offered to throw Anthem in for free. They were on the shelf for $9. Yeah nah.
---
The ONE thing I'm still wondering is, of our Guardian transported Cayde for a long long time or whatever.. where did he had the time to put it in his ship? And also, why didn't they do a little scene with us, transporting the dead body of cayde, while going deeper into the reef, like the Trailer picture? Would have been so much better!
---
Ah, well apparently you can't do the Heroic version if someone on your fireteam hasnt completed the normal version.  The heroic version also gives the Catalyst.  My bad, but if you still need help with the normal version I can help.  (PC player)
---
Did that and it said no repair needed. Am reinstalling now.
---
On ps4. Thanks man, appreciate the offer though, 🤘
---
I'm not even worried about Glimmer. Glimmer cap is going to be increased in Shadowkeep by 150,000
---
I'd actually like that concept ingame, just have the bottom thing cover part of the eye's lower half or something, idk
---
We all cried
---
As much as I despise the PvP community, I can respect people who do this. Good on you man.
---
Gotcha yeah I'm on xbox. What do you spend glimmer on, if anything? Thanks btw
---
I got the full set (cloak, Ace of Spades and Queen of Hearts/ ship) if anyone wanna honor him
---
I decorated the room in brain matter grey for Cayde
---
Some dude literally made a Destiny recovery post in this sub and linked his paypal. Talk about balls lmao.
---
So you don't touch your glimmer? It's useless then?
---
No I simply play enough that I always get more lol I'm mainly worried about shards. I've been starving for them since Forsaken. Spider can get expensive.
---
Too bad I have zero talent with art. I’d love to draw a titan with OEM and the eye lit up.
---
[deleted]
---
Neat, never knew that. Wish we could actually scan it though, same with the Volundr Forge one
---
Are we going to have to do riven legit now? T-T
---
I'm not sure how RNG works over at Bungie because I got the SMG on my second Level 7 run, the sniper on my third (as well as a second masterworked drop afterwards) whereas the shotgun took me around 12/13 Level 7 runs
---
I wanted the gun so much I thought doing it irl.. would be cool for halloween
---
Ok what the hell is spider? lol
---
now I know why everyone is so dissapointed with the Y2 IB armor, I mean the Y1 looks so much better
---
Geomag Stabilizers. They recharge your super when you are close to getting it and Chaos Reach lasts longer.

I’m sorry you prefer the wrong faction. We can’t all have the right opinions - Post made by New Monarchy Gang

It’s because they don’t even have a cognizant argument

They did for me.

You mean to tell me you don't have Forsaken??????
---
Ah, gotta love Destiny's accurate, but annoying physics engine
---
thanks for my new phone background man

Can’t use it since the « nerf ». It doesn’t glow in ly hand like it used to 😢
---
I just want to get the Last Word in here sir, you may refer to me as ThunderLord
---
Lol. Me being angry and me bringing attention to your naysaying attitude are two different things. I’m not sure why you are surprised, though. 
---
It’s a strategy. Not a game plan. A small part of a greater whole. After all, you are able to change your load outs and subclass if certain things aren’t working out. If you think that there’s only one way to do things in this game, then you are the last person I want to take advice from.
---
I’d be down.
---
Nice! Thank you!
---
yeah but you have a benefit of one shotting without even needing an exotic, and the Hunter one shot has three pre requisites, 1) must get meleed first 2) must have melee ability active, and 3) must have the exotic on, while Titans only have one and that is to have the melee charge active and they can use any exotic of their choice. hunters must use liars so they can't equip foetracer, knucklehead, sixth coyote, stompees, frostees, etc. think over what you said
---
So theyre all bad?
---
It's worth it.  Forsaken is the best story Destiny's come out with since the end of the D2 campaign.
---
Jk pls dont kill me
---
Lol pretty much. Now all Bungie needs to do is increase the drop rates of legendary shards. Or better yet increase how many you get per dismantle.
---
hheeee

They’re looking goofy as hell? Or?

Am i the only one who actually likes Asher??

It might for me, but I highly doubt it. My mind works like a multi layered lock. Either you manage to change my mind by working through each of those locks or you give something with enough force behind it to break it entirely on that subject.
---
Destiny 2 metaphorically has 10 of those on it. I'm about dead set on leaving it entirely. The only thing I like is this sub and the games story
---
I posted a more detailed version of this earlier, but my solution was Telesto. Get that with some fusion bonus perks and Telesto everything. 
---
When I say everything, I mean EVERYTHING. It does amazingly good damage to every single mob in the game. 
---
I've heard hammers, tether, and dawnblad are the best bet for this, as is waiting for waves without yellow bars. 
---
I used tether and Telesto and got all 10 in 2-3 days.
---
No it’s the internet. You haven’t been here long have you?
---
I never have my helmet off so I'm assuming a majority also never have it off
---
This is another common answer. Never tried it, but a lot of people swear by Riskrunner.
---
Teams make certain steps so much easier. For anybody trying for this, you can solo it, but decent teammates will cut your time in half.
---
Glad to help a fellow Jojo fan
---
He’s right, you know
---
Just seems pointless.
---
wrong taken blight heroic is 100% random
---
Ha
---
yeah you right
---
EAZ
---
And whats the point of going heroic? Oh thats right exotics drop. lol ok.
---
And that’s fine. I would rather they just provided options than take out PvP, but I am biased too and wouldn’t complain if they did remove it.
---
And I get your raid issue too because I don’t really like raids either. Too convoluted and tedious. Takes too long unless you want to do it with the same people every week. That’s why I just wish they infuse the game with options. Multiple paths of progression/acquisition, in a way that balances challenge and time investment against the rewards. That way people could play what they like to earn gear. Fire example:
---
Raids could have two versions.
---
One version could be more like a long strike with multiple bosses and has matchmaking and players get A SINGLE raid reward per week. Want more rewards per week? Play the challenging LFG version with difficult mechanics that require communication and get a reward for each encounter completion.
---
Missions like Whisper and Zero Hour could also have two versions.
---
You want that new weapon right now? Play this really hard, timed, LFG only activity and it’s yours upon completion. You would rather to do it solo and don’t mind waiting to get it? Play it with no timer and each elemental burn three weeks in a row and it’s yours.
---
I just wish they made efforts to maximize the enjoyment of the game for as many types of players as possible because whether they realize or admit it or not, this game has a little bit of everything and has attracted all different types of gamers. The solution for dealing with that isn’t to try to force everyone to like and play everything. It’s to provide options to let people play what they like. It’s like they want the game do be everything to everyone but then most of what they do is the opposite of that.
---
Did you at least get ace I did
---
He really played well!!! Congratulations!!!
---
If you love tragic stories boy do i got a mind blower for you.   Read literally 99% of in-game lore, its almost all tragedy, from the books to the Exotics.
---
Game was fucking shit on release. Makes me regret breaking the rule for it. Rule 1:No Preorders!
---
Just copy the files to steamapps/common and verify, it'll be a 15GB download at most (significantly better than the entire 80-100GB).
---
Its worth more than that. 
---
The amount of content that you get is astonishing. And now with shadowkeep soon to drop with even more content and mechanics, i am afraid that i won't have enough free time to play it!
---
Not encourage and perpetuate it by continuing to implant pursuits where it makes no sense to do so.
