4 guns this game won't let me have:
---

---
1. Midnight coup (when it's sold I never have the time to finish a raid that week)
---
2. 1k
---
3. Anarchy
---
4. Tarabah
---
---
---
Wow, that’s cool I guess. So basically we have the forsaken exotic dilemma again, great.
---
Yes I am aware of this.
---
Found your post and got a build together for you. Due to Canadian  prices, you just cant pull out as much performance per dollar so I went over your budget a bit but there is room to save some. I built you something that will run destiny 2 on pc at 1080 and 60fps no problem. If you would like anything changed or need any explanation let me know!
---

---
No Titan in it. Literally unusable.
---
Good builds for what? Without specifics it's hard to answer your question as what's best for pve isnt always the best for pvp or even pvevp (gambit).
---
Struggling to see the benefit of writing it all down when it’s already written down on the screen...
---
Ive played since launch and i cant tell you how many times I forget this happens, i should have a special emblem saying how many times ive died to a sparrow by now
---
What platform?
---
We don't talk about titan.  
---
Also, whoever decided a gambit map on titan was a good idea needs to rethink that idea.
---
I reccomend waiting for the massive escalation grind until after you finish the forsaken campaign
---
Yeah theres no way its actually the monitor, for all consoles default settings would be fine on the monitor btw
---
My name is Shaxx Knoxville and this is Jackass D2!!!
---
_Guardian, we must unify and repel the Cabal onslau.....what in the fuck are you doing?_
---
Got one for ya go onto the D2 clan finder and Look up flat earth ninjas we have a discord and the only requirement is to be online regularly
---
More than a couple can, only a couple do. CoD pros could make it as well Im sure.
---
Im not offended about anything, sorry pumpkin.
---
I hope its the boss that drops all 3 weapons. I need the sniper to complete my destinations seal.
---
Well they did put crota in the trailer
---
Well they did put crota in the teaser
---
I dont think it's supposed to but it does
---
As others have stated, you can probably find those kinds of comments on bungie forums pretty easily. Kind of ironic that the bungue forums is where most of the bungie hate comes from. That community is backwards. Some of the comments I've seen on there are absolutely pathetic to say the least.
---
_Psst hey kid y’know if you use the chicken pet emote then the coin flip you can flip the chicken, try it._
---
Until they get hit with bofa that is
---
They'll be usable as ornaments when shadowkeep drops so save them until you get the whole set to drop as I don't think repeats can drop. And then dismantle them when you finish them for the bright dust.
---
No problem. I totally get where you are coming from. First soltice I power grinded 2 hunters to the tower after deleting my titan and warlock. Waited a day for the event to start and realized you needed all three classes for the exclusives ,so I deleted my two hunters and remade a titan and warlock. I power grinded them in two days and got all three armor master worked in the same week. You can do it if you want it bad enough. It's going to be a grind from hell, but I believe in you.
---
Rebuild your PS4 database
---
Are you on PC?
---
&lt;3
---
Nope, ps4
---
Of course regular crucible and other gamemodes have strats. Countdown had those plus bomb defusal/planting strats. granted I mostly played below 3000 rank, but most countdown games I did were fun, despite the way overblown lethality of roaming supers
---
Bruh
---
Hmmm... okay well I’m not sure if this is an option in ps4 but I know that when this happened to me on PC, I opened up the Blizzard client and selected a “scan and repair” option that fixed the issue. Not sure if there is some sort of option like that on ps4 tho. Good luck!
---
At first I didnt even care about all three classes but then I read itll be the first armor 2.0 in chapter 2 and you have to do all 3 to unlock it. And of course, like I said, I had no idea about the event until a couple days ago. I'm ready for the carpal tunnel lmao
---
Most have been doing the mad bomber mission.
---
Oh ok thanks, yea I’m on renewed
---
It's big brain time.
---
Planting forces the other team to push you if they aren't. Planting when the enemy team is already pushing you well loses you the round. You can play your life to make sure they don't gt picks or try to be aggressive and get picks yourself. You can inspect enemy loadouts, surmise their strats, and change your loadout/playstyle to mitigate theirs.
---
Bro that’s goals. Marry her before I do
---
This is why the cabal fear us so much.... we weaponise sparrows against guardians.... WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO
---
i don't think that's gonna work on savathûn seeing as she's all about trickery. after all she gave the dreaming city ligma without touching it
---
Update... Logged into PS4, light level is correct on all characters. PC is the only problem.

Congratulations you just made me look through a massive list of Alan Tudyk quotes
---
The orb glitch wasn’t even used the first time to solo two floor Riven. You have to admit, even two flooring her BY YOURSELF is ridiculously powerful.
---
"I'm about to do what's called a pro gamer move"
---
You tryna shoot? Lemme think about it. Nah
---
Trying to talk down to people by calling them sarcastic terms of endearment, sounds like you're pretty offended
---
Mine eventually went though, but I guess I didn't realize you couldn't download the game, so you can't play it?
---
I dont remember it ever being good but go on
---
It can be impossibly rough, man. Sometimes I really kick a lot of ass. Sometimes it’s even, we work hard and we barely win. Sometimes I’m lucky to get 2 kills and my ass is handed to me nonstop...
---
No you have to wait til oct 1 for the cross save to kick in, but you should be able to play on whichever console you’re on right now
---
Faster
---
Yeah but I’m pretty sure it has the best melee abilities which imo makes up for it

Your submission has been removed in violation of Rule 2 - Spam.

And then bungie grounds you and takes it away.
---
No it's not.
---
Watching teammates steal your kills you're about to get or post up while you're shooting it out with an enemy who then kills you is.
---
To say nothing of the occasional spectral blades or Fist Of Havoc fucking your shit up.
---
You spelled “striker titan and dawn blade and spectral blade” wrong.  Did you shorthand it?
---
Is that oryx?
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ that’s how the game is. Go for longer range kills when you know your teammates can’t fire that far.
---
This was very relatable
---
And your life has been enriched in doing so.
---
I guess?
---
will i able to use cross save and transfer my ps4 stuff to Destiny 2 New Light on pc on october 1st?
---
Where did bungie say cross save is time limited?
---
Nice. I had a feeling you were brilliant
---

I guess great minds think alike :)

That was sexy
---
"....Yep I should go grab the arbalest.. Wait, almost forgot to clear my postmaster. Oh shit an exotic engram ! cool"
---
You can guess what came out of it. lawl
---
It'd basically lift but slow
---
I got Legend for the first time this season, and I use QP as a way to warm up for sweats or for comp so I can improve. I know some of the people I scrim with do the same, It'd usually be just a few games then into sweats or comp. I know this isn't the case for everyone, but there are some exceptions. QP is also the best way to improve team callouts/coordination without impeding your glory or with little pressure.
---
Use a fireteams medallion that you get from Tess eververse they give you an xp boost otherwise just play the game
---
I’m trying to, work in progress lol
---
Dismantle *everything* which comes from Eververse - ships, sparrows, shaders, armor, etc. You already have these saved in your collections and come Shadowkeep, the armor will be ornaments and ships, shaders, sparrows, etc will all cost legendary shards to pull - not glimmer.
---
Yeah, I just got Legend for the first time this season, unfortunately, I got 2 more to go.
---
My bad it's not 4k it's a Asus rog 34 inch curved ultra wide that renders at 3440x1440.
---
No? Well me either.
---
It's not what you think it is
---
Arbalest never required the Annual Pass to obtain or use. It was first available to everyone during the Revelry event, and then moved to the exotic loot pool after Revelry ended. Go for it dude!
---
Zavala Origin Story of him being a cockney geeza in his original life confirmed.
---
Mega man blaster
---
Did too much damage too fast. I'm still not sure if this is a bug or a way to make the strike more fun.
---
But I could, right now, purchase the complete collection on Battlenet and use my PS4 characters fully loaded? Would that be wasting the $40 for the complete collection or would I need to purchase that anyway if I want to use any of that content?
---
In a utopian future among the stars the classes will reach perfect harmony. It will be like rock paper scissors where the odds are split completely even and fair. Only skill will affect PvP. Today is not that day. Playing hunter requires that skill more than others for sure, mobility armor makes us paper thin and anything else takes away our ability to run from superior abilities and resilience/recovery.
---
Technically no, because you can still use them with the 90-day caveat that you seem to understand, but effectively they will be gone because you would most likely not want to disable/re-enable over and over. So Bert still exists but you probably won't ever see him again :/
---
If I want to cross save my data from ps4 to steam and play shadowkeep, do I have to pre-order shadow keep on ps4 or steam? Or will buying it on ps4 automatically go with steam as well?
---
Oh it definitely adds a much needed challenge because he stops you off the plates as you try to charge them.
---
Das me
---
It's all about the benjamins, baby
---
god i wish it was. id play hunter more often if so
---
Welcome Guardian! enjoy the game! it's really fun! join a clan if u can, also visit:
---
 [DIM](https://app.destinyitemmanager.com/index.html)  
---
It's a nice website for manage inventory and characters :) Eyes up guardian!
---
found the “boomer”. go into cardiac arrest, grandpa
---
I feel ya, it can get obnoxious in Gambit
---
It is. It’s pat likely referencing the eris morne cloak from d1. Look up “destiny cloak of dusktorn”
---
He's in the forgotten shores. Everyone calls him Randal because he is a Reaver Vandal and sticks out as different due to how strong he is.
---
He really wasn't.
---
Lol. What?
---
you’re super fuckin annoying and I’m blocking you now lmao
---
We killed his sorry ass, crashed his funeral service, and kicked his dad's teeth in to boot. Crota is our collective bitch.
---
Yaaaaaaauuuus
---
What were these messages in response to? Were you just driving around on VoidStreak I'm assuming? Then he just started some beef?
---
Lol...I loved how you looked around for him! Like.....uh.....what, whered he go????
---
You clipped that from that youtuber hush video lol
---
Well I did it in two days
---
12 hours, but the 50 bounty’s takes multiple days, so pick up bounties and don’t claim them
---
Unfriend immediately.
---
It only gives u a blue engram
---
Thanks. For some reason couldnt remember
---
Should I tweet at bungie ?
---
this
---
FIGHTTT FOREVERRRR GUARDIAN!!!!
---
IMO destiny 1&amp;2 has one of the top 5 best series campaigns I’ve ever played ...I lowkey enjoy the story/lore more than the actual “endgame” content !!
---
I would. If it's not a bug then they could direct you on how to fix it.
---
Omfg😂💀 that’s a whole F in chat
---
Quick update: 
---
Went into quickplay and it seems it isn’t much better there. Maybe i’ll wait a few weeks until myself and the other cross players are a little more used to mouse and keyboard before venturing into crucible again
---
Not life. DEATH!
---
Did u get that from hushes vid
---
And that’s why everyone is switching to pc, I guess.
---
there.... is no light.... here....
---
Owes allegiance to no kelllll
---
"one poor blueberry" I am DYING
---
Coldheart is the better single target dps weapon, Prometheus lens has some AoE potential for clearing ads
---
K thx
---
I still cannot for the life of me understand why people keep communication channels open to randos. The only people who can contact me are the people on my friends list: 100% effective at keeping nonsense like this out.
---
Or download “Pinterest” IMO you’ll find some better ones there
---
Mountaintop is MILES better. Jötunn is shit.
---
Do you not have it? If yes get it
---
And here I am just trying to finish one set before the event ends.
---
They’ve said they’re updating crucible heavily in shadowkeep.
---
Won't happen. Bungie caters to the 1% elitist population.  Those bastards like it this way. I suggest "ANY" other fps pvp to get your fix. Just play everything else destiny offers.✌
---
And when you whatsapp the void, does it leave the two blue ticks?
---
I too just got back into Destiny 2 and have had some very similar facepalmable moments..
---
OK thx
---
How do you get it to follow or seek people? 
---
Also i call that move the negative karma ball haha
---
How I feel when I outsnipe that dodging hunter
---
I remember when my friend always had to eat dinner in the start/middle of the raid and I would spend 30-45 minutes looking at Saturn.
---
I managed to get into a game where at the end I was literally soloing a 4 stack
---
No more engrams soon......😕
---
Git gud and you’ll love PvP🤣
---
Did ya just assume
---
should have said "Oh, My" at the end
---
Fancy
---
Were you in crucible and killed him with outbreak or were you literally just riding around on your sparrow bc he said both
---
I don't know what it is, but Quickplay is super-grindy right now.  Lots of matches I've been in this week ended with the time running out rather than either team reaching the scoring threshold.   I'm probably going to make a run at Fabled on the solo queue before the season is out, and I'm not looking forward to it.
---
That happens too often, RIP.
---
Did you tell him how you have so many or did you just let him believe his fantasies
---
I've always been a very guy
---
A group took a sparrow through a whole raid in D1...
---
https://youtu.be/RF3gOptffbU
---
Because they are. They probably didn't imagine the game would last for years, it's been a long time that they started just making shit up on the way at it shows, like many books or TV series that were meant to end several seasons earlier but decided to extend them because it turned out to be a much higher success. Gotta keep exploiting that hen laying golden eggs.
---
r/sharditkeepit
---
Of course it doesn’t make sense not to try. I’m just saying sweats have a bad rep for going beast mode in QP that’s all.
---
I had it muted and thought you meant the memes came from players having enough time to make memes during the loading screen in hyperspace
---
I’ll be on all weekend. HMU
---
But have you ever seen a kid sit there and type out an essay like that? Definitely an adult... definitely had a bad day... definitely projecting his/her problems on someone else... definitely super jelly of that sexy sparrow... definitely sad he can’t pay anyone to grind it for him (like Luna and recluse)
---
HOLY SHIT IS THAT A FUCKING JOJO REFERENCE! THIS IS AMAZING GUARDIAN
---
&gt;Just let it go 
---
😂
---
Got any tips for improving aim? I’m okay at movement on pc but aiming is a different story for me. Coming from Xbox where I’d run revoker/NF, I can’t hit a damn thing with revoker on pc
---
"So you assume I'm a kid" 
---
\*sees the fair lot of emojis in each messaage\*
---
You know, OP does have a point.
---
Yeah proving the “community” completes all objectives.
---
How is austringer on pc?
---
Yet he wanted to tilt you... Oof
---
That sparrow looks like an out of control dildo.
---
We should make a petition for this guys it looks so cool
---
Agreed. The entire base campaign is awesome and nothing else lives up to it - not even Forsaken. Ghaul was an absolute bitch to fight when I first started but I rolled through Forsaken like nothing was even there.
---
Why this is not punished HARD must be Bungies idea of customer friendly gaming.
---
Lmao i love it too
---
All legendary gear will drop after Oct 1st as 2.0
---
All gear in ur inv will stay 1.0
---
Thanks,although im slightly confused with the power level.Will all my armor become 750 when shadowkeep launches?
---
Yeah. Every thing you have with you right now will hit 750 (including the vault)
---
The player gets a buff stepping out the bubble with a timer.
---
Oh damn,thanks
---
Yeah if it says you can,you can
---
Receiving hatemail for playing good is my favorite!
---
YO, if you're on Xbox, just use the built-in LFG tool.
---
Hit guide, LB twice to get to the parties tab, select "Looking for Group, select Destiny 2, and then browse through the posts, search/filter, or make a post. 
---
Quick and easy to use, and every Xbox player I know uses that tool, so you're more likely to find people, and you don't have to wade through PC/PS4 players posts.
---
I'd be better if shadow keep was out but untill then I'm big chillen
---
lol you should have said that
---
Precisely this.
---
The current season pass grants 3 small activities. Forges, reckoning and gambit prime, and the menagerie. Do some research if that intruegues you. Forsaken itself gives quite a lot of content in pve, but isnt necessary unless you want the season pass this year
---
Cool. Glhf
---
And because of that it really IS related to destiny, because of that quote. Don’t be “more chatolic than the Pope”...
---
What kind of answers do you expect on a Destiny 2 subreddit?
---
We're all here because we love and play Destiny 2.
---
Bruh i’m tripping balls rn and i swear now i completely understand what these fuckin guardians have been talking about all this time
---
## bruh 😡😤🤣🤣👏
---
Will they be free when the new expansion comes out? Or will always be part of the season pass. It is only £12 now and it is tempting 😀
---
Since this asshat won’t say it.. Congrats on getting the voidstreak sparrow! How many sets did you have to grind 100 mini bosses for?
---
The dudes trolling, either that or he thinks warframe is actually a better game than destiny in which case we don’t want that kind of idiocy in our community.
---
Im sure that in the destiny universe the guardians would call other guardians that destroy them in the crucible dredgens like a hate statement
---
Oh come the f\*ck on, you recognized the joke in the original comment but not in mine?  
---
People, what the hell
---
That boost only works one time. Any characters past your first boost will cost you silver.
---
Yes. The website says €125, therefore you can assume that it will cost 125
---
Should be opposite, well is the superior super, seven with weapons of light.
---
Love it! Just started back again myself
---
/u/seroo25
---
Warframe sucks ass
---
My lord this is so true, just got recluse a week ago. My team had 4 members, the other 3. We won the round so two left, we almost get 4v1'd by a bottom tree striker with Jotunn and OEM.
---
Or moreover as Nietzsche said, "If you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back at you."
---
MIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIISTAAAA
---
This person must hate the word “you”.
---
I love people like that. "Oh he has a PvE focused title, but he sucks at PvP. INVALID TITLE!" 
---
(Not saying you suck)
---
My own performance, while nothing spectacular was heavily hindered by my teammates. You try and get a 40+ kill game, where if you check my history happens quite a lot, where it’s a 1 v 6
---
They gotta earn money, can't give it away for free...
---
I’d rather eat paste with a side of crayons than play comp
---
Imagine being so stupid to think that’s the point. You try to 1v6 big man and you lmk how that goes
---
My internship is gonna be a bumpy ride xd
---
The gun is sacred aura
---
Imma guess this is WotW by any chance?
---
You gotta put your discount code in like it tells you.
---
I once had this dude send me a party invite after a Crucible match, and I didn't answer because I was just grinding out a quest. He proceeded to inv me 4 more times, and then messaged me "join" another 3 times, I told him I don't know him. He then proceeded to explain he wanted me to join because he was the guy who killed me when my super was up. My guess is to vocally let me know he did it.
---
Hmm...I have Mountaintop and recluse and Luna’s Howl AND I got all of the Solstice gear on all three guardians. Mind you, I work full time and go to college full time at night. So what exactly a his/her excuse???
---
It's possible i did it at 700 when the Quest released
---
The fact that people go try hard whenever they use those in quick play is kinda sad, I also understand that not everyone goes try hard with those.
---
Mars? Shadowkeep is on the moon.
---
The mars challenge. Shadowkeep doesn’t come out until October.
---
Yup. Im in my destiny phase right now, but i'll be back to my eidolon hunts soon enough.
---
It is disabled on detection on almost every game. You need an external port( XiM in most cases) to trick your console into thinking the keyboard and mouse are a controller. It's literally cheating dude.
---
I don’t like using mouse and keyboard so...
---
What Mars challenge?
---
To be honest I’m not really sure.
---
Just play an extra game
---
I'm at about 70 - 75 games so far
---
I am not a comp player, or even a PvP player
---
Still about 500 glory away from recluse
---
But i wanted the seal for moments of triumph and the only thing that i have never got is a crucible pinnacle weapon
---
This has not been fun, and I just needed to share my pain.
---
Sorry to all the teams I ended up on during the climb.
---
But also thank you.
---
F
---
The eyes remind me of Toothless, from "How to Train A Dragon".
---
Wow, pulled out your second reddit account for this post?
---
As soon as they announced it I instantly pre ordered it because I know I’ll regret it if I didn’t get it
---
I hope the jackass that made it so you have to buy the entire game over again isn’t a part of shadowkeep.
---
I feel you brother
---
I like how the salty crucible players downvote you when we all know the truth
---
And they look cool too. Anyone know the exact amount of bonus mobility they give?
---
don't worry i will, just need to go have a small cry first XD
---
My bad i didn’t buy it so I forgot
---
also want to know......
---
Yep, its to make up for the hot garbage that is Thundercrash.
---
Unfortunately that's how the meta works in competitive games, either adapt or suffer. Luckily shadowkeep is coming out and the meta will change. Maybe take a break from comp until then .
---
We suffer together lmao
---
Probably from the UK kappa
---
Gratz
---
Yup!!!
---
Gotta put the code in
---
Then there’s hunters with party flares and light shows.
---
Clearly mad cus bad smh...
---
It seems that they want us to use it to set traps. Which is fine in theory. However, when you compare it to supers like bottom tree striker, dawnblade, voidlocks, etc... It is very lackluster. I didn't realize that it was that broken in d1... Idk. Maybe the neutral game was supposed to be good enough to offset the supers weaknesses?
---
I just want my throwing knife to one shot headshot at least.
---
I’m probably going to get fired for being “sick” too many days. Oh well 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
It may cause code Guitar.
---
Have you acquired a jotunn yet? I find the best way to counter something is to use it and see what gives you the most trouble.
---
In my experience, tight hallways and unaware snipers are the bread and butter of jotunn.
---
A bit of horizontal wiggle room can make it almost useless.
---
Also, if they've got ammo, don't play chicken. Even if your sniper has moving target, it's tough to dodge while ads.
---
P.S. that auto rifle is doing you no favors. Might try for a good pulse (blast furnace is certainly in a league of its own) or the last word for shoring up close/close-mid engagements.
---
WHA-
---
It comes out right after I start college wish me luck
---
No teams hitting is.
---
A friend of mine bought forsaken like 2 months before me and decided to wait for me to buy it so we can go trough the content together and I still thank him from time to time.
---
How many hours of hard work, sweat, blood and tears, did it take?
---
Lexington Ohio.... hello there local traveler
---
As i know that everyone is so very much invested at this point i just wanted to give an update, the next game was myself and 7 blueberries and the Bungie matchmaking gods decided to put the 4 OEMs together on the enemy team.
---
At least it ended quickly.
---
That’s why I’m the best player out of all my friends.
---
 lol so much antioxidants
---
Long enough for me to not suck with the fighting lion anymore lol.
---
Is this when the free version comes out too? I can’t wait for that to come out. I can finally wait to buy an expansion and not be locked out of 90% of the game.
---
Fair, didn't expect to get away with it honestly. Surprised it lasted as long as it did
---
The other day I spawned inside a blade barrage and was a little salty.
---
I don't understand how grouping with someone in a fireteam to help them climb isn't help?
---
Did you only use fighting lion, or Play of the game too?
---
Fighting lion, militias birthright, and play of the game.
---
Oh okay so even though they already have the gun and not the quest it will count?
---
Lol wtf? Slowva with skull was broken and everyone knew it. Have one super and you’re never gonna run out of supers. It’s good they nerfed it, it opens a lot of other builds up, and I honestly have more fun now than then. And btw have you looked at the shadowkeep changes? I’m sure you’ll want to travel forth in time to play it because it makes the game sooo much better.
---
Not cool
---
You can still play the content. Not sure how relevant the old stuff will be come October but there are other reasons to play old content outside of power, namely for the exclusive gear and the titles.
---
Been there buddy, feel your pain.
---
Thats just unlucky, guy launched one from way outside your spawn area like a god
---
If you think using non-standard on a console is cheating, like a MnK, then by that definition using MnK is cheating.
---
In that, I would agree with you.
---
He’s just making a side note- “People using MnK on a console is not having the same experience as they would on PC”- more so a clarification than a defense.
---
I just think you’re being way too quick on bashing him.
---
Back in forsaken when it got buffed and shards got nerfed
---
I have 3D printed this model, but finishing the print is taking me some time. It is a lot of work to make those print lines disappear!
---
I want jotunn. I don't want it to use in crucible because i don't really like crucible anyway but it looks so fun to use in general.
---
Lmao maybe. I mean all I have left to do is get the triumphant sentry and massacre medals. But I already burned out last week so I've had my break xD
---
Pull up ghost, only works in certain activities though
---
I hope they will do the same thing as in Forsaken, even bigger. And I hope for new good pve and pvp hand cannons, love them.
---
*cough* warlock true master race *cough*
---
Oh. Y e s. *Yes.* **YES**
---
It’s got handling
---
Any idea of a price range? I still wanna be able to buy Iceborne for Monster Hunter
---
In the loretab for the Last Wish Titan Mark, Mark of the Great Hunt. Mara fires a wish into the Wall of Wishes to summon up Shaxx and has him recite Shakespeare to her. The tab ends noting

Which is just enough innuendo that everyone decided to ship them.

Shaxx has and had a lot of relationships, of course. If you got the bow The Vow around Valentines Day Shaxx canonically married you. He married us all.

Like literally a year ago? Skull has been useless since the season of the drifter.

If you buy the base game for pretty cheap all dlc are only 30-40 dollars

Then it sounds like it will be the other players in the match to me. There is nothing you can do about it. If you run into an instance where someone isn’t taking damage the only thing to do is report that player for a poor connection. Sorry chief
---
Thank you for this screenshot. I've had bad juju sitting in the vault for about a month and i haven't even used it since i got it and played with it for 10 minutes. I bloody love that guj and this screenshot just reminded me that i should probably start using it more.

What's wrong?

y'now what?i'll try to make the Rahool-violi,if i do them correctly i'll post it on this subreddit.
---
Stay tuned,because this is interesting as hell
---
Yeh, but SWShield was just citing an example of Bungies balancing being wierd.
---
Visited the queens court every three weeks for the last year but for season of the drifter unfortunately, tried everything indeed.
---
I have that roll, and a snapshot box breathing I use for PvP. Great for shutting down supers I can hit the crit.

Why 3 times?

AFK farming is a type of mobile game, not for a genre such as destiny. If you want to ruin games for people, go play gambit and invade every chance you get

Thank you for the help, also big props to you for playing it all solo!
---
Id try not to worry too much, the majority of players are still on console.
---
Thanks man. Thorn was the same way too.
---
Are you playing multiple characters of the same class (i.e. 2 titans or 2 warlocks)?
---
I'm still stuck on the last strike :/ dope artwork though. Maybe I'll get it one of these days!
---
Uhmm
---
Ok
---
Top arc tree and liars handshake babyyyyyy
---
Well good luck on your journey, I'm on PS4 or I'd help ya out!
---
You are objectively wrong, PC is superior in nearly every way, but whatever floats your boat dude.
---
And this is Bungie we're talking about, even if Activision were still in the picture, console would not be forgotten. Why would they forget about 2/3 of the platforms the game is on, especially when those 2 platforms are, afaik, a vast majority of the games population and Bungie's income.
---
Don't be silly, they won't abandon 2/3 of their income, that'd be dumb as shit
---
I mean this whole argument is invalid due to the fact that the PC player base is much smaller compared to the console player base. So for bungie to not provide the same level of support for the console version would be committing business suicide
---
For now but with the release of cross save a large portion of console players have been moving over
---
This isn't accurate anymore since they made it get less energy back over time.

I remember the original gunslinger in d1 would do this. I would go whole matches in crucible just knifing everyone.

I personally believe that Shaxx is Awoken due to so many relationships with Awoken from the Reef, like Mara and Sjur Eido

Correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't the most recent nerf in response to huge complaints about Gwisin Spectral being OP? IIRC that was when you could spam an attack to zip across the map without losing any super while invisible.
---
It may be 'useless' in comparison to other supers since you can get 2-3 kills with it compared to Dawnblade and Striker bottoms, but IMO this is the state all roaming supers should be in.

Same. I could use upgrades on a couple of guns, but after the Mars event, I'll get them then. Other than that runes are for armor. Gotta get my rolls quick!

When is the last time you played? It's gotten some huge graphical updates in recent years, and another one is coming that beefs up the engine's light handling. I think it's a really graphically pleasing game now.
---
Unless you mean the "ugly mechanical organisms" aesthetic that they chose as a stylistic choice. I can understand that.
---
Is that hush?

no

Even got the sacrifices to. Well done

Poor kinderguardian. It's for the greater good

I started at 330 glory and about 5-6 hours I ended at 20

You will start Shadowkeep on even ground with every one else. Bungie is going to push everyone to 750.

So is lvl 30 the max lvl for non dlc destiny 2 if so to get to lvl 50 I would have to buy forsaken

I remember glitching up there before black armory came out and seeing the annex

Is it just me or does it seem like when a teammate gets hit by arc web they instantly run into their team?
---
New light will push everyone to 750 so newcomers or returnees don't have to stress about the grind. I would recommend catching up on some of the exotic quests though- outbreak, etc
