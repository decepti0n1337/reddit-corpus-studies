Yes, any player can enter the Zero Hour mission, but only players with Forsaken are capable of completing it (meaning those who do not own Forsaken have to be carried).

Yeah paint is a great program but photoshop is much better.

Or the stomp mechanic sending you towards a wall or the abyss

It also gives 13.3% completion on your catalyst, cutting its completion time from 5 to 3 weeks.
---
It's probably in your own interest that you get on that as soon as you can.
---
Gz though!

Get better at the game then

Sorry my phone glitched didnt realize

They did finally with Fortnite and I think a couple others, but I think it may just be to big of a project to put that into the game when they are assumedly working on the next DLCs and D3.
---
Bungie said something like they look forward to observing how the Fortnite cross play works out and how they might implement in the future. So it may happen down the road. I could be wrong, just how I think things are going from what I've heard.
---
üòÇ it‚Äôs all good
---
Gun, no real exotic perks, allows one more exotic piece of armor to be worn at once (2 exotic armors at once) and vice versa(armor gives extra exotic gun)
---
The Fatebringer/Imago Loop uses the base model, but at least has new geometry built on it.
---
Sturm + Drang
---
Haha... I would kill for the DLC. Not even the Annual Pass just the Standard Edition.
---
If you get trapped by the arc barriers, look around for a hidey-hole you can crouch into. Trevor shouldn‚Äôt be able to get you when you‚Äôre in there. In my experience, he also doesn‚Äôt tend to go down the side paths.
---
Nah, thats celebrating with a bang!
---
‚Äúwell fuck me i guess i‚Äôm the invader now‚Äù

TRV-3R turned around. You can relax now.

This is a known bug, similar to the bug with the Izanagi's Burden quest. There is nothing we can do to fix this, it's an issue on Bungie's end.

Played in same room as the missus last night and my punishment was being surprised as I showered with "Trevor's coming!". Thought was done shitting myself for one day.

You surely can't read properly

Pumpgun and tractorgun man i dont know  but i hate u
---
There's just something exciting about invading. Fighting a 1v4 in the crucible is one thing, but hunting down guardians is another thing entirely.
---
You are crazy! I am trying to get it, but I do not want to solo it. (I play on PS4 if anybody is willing to help)
---
I like the cut of your post sonny both accurate and eye opening didn‚Äôt even know about that beta npc from half life
---
But not too much shouting, we're not dragonball
---
Might be a guy called KobOneArt, seems like his art style. Known for stuff like this, I think bungie featured him a year or two ago aswell.
---
That actually scared me.
---
*laughs in liar‚Äôs handshake*
---
Yes I understand that it stacks. But just bc it‚Äôs better doesn‚Äôt make it more fun to use? I don‚Äôt know, it doesn‚Äôt feel right for the few 2-3hrs I was playing with it. Range was the biggest killer for me. 
---
My BF has better control? But again maybe it‚Äôs just time using it. 33k kills and I have it down to a fine art on trash mobs and clearing. That makes it hard to move on when you know exactly where your shots will be.
---
Hammer head with ambitious assassin, extended mag, backup mag and feeding frenzy. Few kills and an instant reload and I have 110 in the mag! It‚Äôs insane, goes forever

In fairness, "of the numerous sub-basement levels, only 4 have been cleaned and been certified safe for use."  Seems a bit weak for over a year after the red war.

Somehow got tractor cannon. Which is the one I've wanted for so long. Promptly put it on my warlock

If you get hit mid-air you will get beamed into orbit

losing 39 motes? he was just stealing my kills and losing it to invaders or just die from npc attack
---
Lore piece from last week's Xur bounty
---
that is beyond what I can imagine, although I busted my as# on that game and we won. I banked 78 motes , killed 24 guardians
---
or just, tell them not to pick up motes, let others do it
---
Thats just sad
---
oh! hmmm
---
Is it the sturm quest? If so you need an exotic *Engram* since it used to not autodecrypt legendary and exotics, the Leviathan Raids can still drop exotic engrams
---
The explosion one shots other people, it‚Äôs super underrated
---
Nice! yeah it was like a perfect storm. The other team took forever to get their primeval and kill it. But we still couldn't overcome that many lost motes.
---
He is unstoppable now. We can only pray for mercy.
---
It‚Äôs SO easy to 3 shot people. The range on it and it‚Äôs so consistent when it comes to being able to headshot.
---
Well eat that anyway, you inorganic... network... intelligences...
---
He has evolved

TR3-VR: I am inevitable
---
Yes, but when you abandon quests, don't they look like a square icon that gives the name of the quest when you hover over them? What does it look like?
---
It‚Äôs so dang cute tbh
---
Is it good? I have a few from the gunsmith with pretty good rolls
---
Someone commissioned a mini lunas howl and black talon.

My exact loadout, seems rather effective.
---
Accurized Rounds + Feeding Frenzy + Rampage
---
fair nuff, always though it was weird that bungie sold miniature versions instead of to scale models but i guess there is a demand for it.
---
There isn't one.  You do not see the quest ANYWHERE, you have to know you abandoned it and find it at Sloane.  I tried for an hour to find it and couldn't, and then finally just guessed that it was abandoned
---
Liars handshake would fit the look pretty well imo
---
Wait, so you talk to Sloane to restart the quest, but just talking to her puts it back on your map? It doesn't look like, say, the Thorn or Last Word quest where it appears as a square quest icon under the Drifter's inventory, similar to a bounty? With the Thorn and Last Word quests, you have to manually click on the quest square in the Drifter's inventory to resume the quest.
---
I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs to get past UK laws regarding props that look like guns.

There must be lot of sweating going on under that armor #lowblowaboutchapandlunacombo #jk
---
Np, but i like the way you think! Keep on searching for those little bungie hints guardian.
---
Drifter seems very suspicious and sort of annoying. When you talk to him regarding OBP, he says we took something that wasn't ours, and then wants us to get him something too.
---
Bitch, that IS my weapon from D1, so I'm only taking it back. It isn't anyone else's. And I've been banking motes for you for months now, what you doing for me?

---
Is it really?
---
See, I'll do the same, but the blueberries don't give me the same favors. I'm not sure if the skill curve is just that high, or if people at my level just happen to not have the same mindset (not feeding kills, playing the objective) as I do. Had a Survival where I only died twice, but the 2nd was an immediate knockout due to how quickly the lives dropped.
---
I got it last night. Idk if it was a bug or what but I tried it on several maps in crucible and was only getting 9 crit damage or it wasn't hitting at all. Maybe it just has shit range compared to other pulses?
---
Where's Trevor fucker at
---
ME RN LMAOOO
---
Nothing personnel kid
---
Try using outbreak perfected as your exotic, you‚Äôll get outbreak perfected in no time

Literally thought the same thingüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Haha the Nova Bomb cracked me up. He didn't even kill anyone.
---
Fuck trevor that bitch hit me like 4 times when i first attempted it

Theres a joker in this pack!!!

Sounds just like my ghost üòÇ

Relatable.

Haha Devrim gave me queensbreaker the other day . It was the last random drop exotic I needed I was so hyped

R.i.p

Umm how about no?

Pretty fun still. I left at the end of forsaken, came back with a ton to do. Came back a couple months ago and I'm just now catching up.

Who the hell do you think you are speaking such brain dead nonsense?
---
First off how do you expect us to complete the trilogy If we just update D2. Forgot about that one didn‚Äôt you?
---
Secondly how do you expect us to have innovation within the game if we have them refine and tune this games systems to perfection? That‚Äôs not how you make games. You need to get promising mechanics, release sequel, trash all previous mechanics for blatantly worse ones with the intent on patching back those systems down the line. 
---
Plus nobody will know new destiny content is ever released if we don‚Äôt have a uniform  numbered release strategy. I can‚Äôt tell the difference between destiny 2 and destiny 2: the nine cometh at the Best Buy. I‚Äôll bet 98% of us couldn‚Äôt either. 
---
Etc
---
There‚Äôs too many variables that cause issue by not going to a third game. Sorry man.
---
TR3-VR isn't a raid boss because he is unkillable.
---
If you‚Äôre only getting that much it might be time to upgrade my dude lol this game is super optimized and shouldn‚Äôt struggle like that
---
Ah shit I'll never get it then, cheers. Loved my supremacy in d1 year 1 tho. Thanks for response
---
I‚Äôve been playing a lot of crucible working towards my Redrix and I‚Äôve noticed one common thing: there are A LOT of very, very inept players. And I‚Äôm trying to say this in the nicest way possible lol

crimson was struck from the reckord for the same reason the killdoser was dismantled and sent to separate scrapyards to be destroyed, to prevent copycats.
---
They didn't want evil guardians seeking it out for the sake of murdering other guardians like the original owner. I'm not talking about thorn or crimson here (which is red death modified into a handcannon).
---
I'm talking about the specific situation where we stop fallen robbing a gun and decide to keep it for ourselves instead of just leaving it. i highly doubt even zavala would see us holding onto it as worse than leaving it in an already broken vault for the fallen or cabal.
---
he would probably be annoyed if we broke into the vault, weakening its defences for future thieves, just for the sake of grabbing weapons for ourselves but that's not what happened.
---
(edit: just to note, we are guardians, we guard shit. that shit could include possibly dangerous weaponry from the hands of our enemies).
---
Not you.
---
And that's not D2 content.

Spam elsewhere. This is your only warning.

I know. I was waiting on the sub to go to. Gave me the answer I needed good looks

What shader is that?

But you can one phase a raid boss with it. It‚Äôs really a PvE exotic

Bruh, Day 1 of The Dark Below DLC, I thought Eris Morn was a total space goth babe. Everyone distanced her, but I saw the beauty beneath those shabby brown robes and green, ectoplasmic Hive eyes.
---
From everything I have seen and tried with them, Liar‚Äôs handshake only triggers when on arcstrider. Even for the incoming melee portion despite what the description of the perk would suggest.
---
And some gunsmith materials to cap it all off!
---
So hot. Don't let those endgame armor guys bring you down.
---
Genuine question
---
&gt; all the content we have now 
---
Is this actually true? All I see from the last time I've played at Haloween is Gambit Prime and a few bounties from the annual DLC, as I refuse to spend over ¬£100 to play Destiny 2.
---
Pretty sure he went around the other way and kept Eramis's forces from retreating until we got there.
