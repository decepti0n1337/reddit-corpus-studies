Taniks has no House. He kneels before no banner, owes allegiance to no Kell. He is a murderer, and very good at what he does. I have been tracking him since Wolves broke their chains, yeees? Now Taniks works for Wolf Pack, but not for long.

---
Think it's a random drop at the end of warden of nothing nightfall
---
The Hive are sending an Ogre!
---
As someone who mained a titan for most of D2, I can‚Äôt help but wonder when people are going to learn to run away from that super. They have a lot of armor and every kill gives them health back. Unless you‚Äôre rocking wardcliff just fucking run.  Unless he was right on top of you when you started running he won‚Äôt catch you, and if he does he wasted so much of his super trying to catch you that he can‚Äôt chain 11 kills like this vid. 
---

---
Not to take away from OP, that was a great streak, dude. Sometimes blueberries just gonna...blueb?
---
Why not do it then
---
It's the Nightfall exclusive from Warden of Nothing, it's the only one of its archetype in the game.
---
Oh ok. Im soloplayer so no nightfall for me.
---
Nice, looks pretty neat btw
---
This is epic
---
What?
---
We had a little baby 266 Titan in my clan's IB match last night. He was on the enemy team and basically hid in the back of the map the entire game.  We won, even though the other 5 were really doing their best.
---
I unironically love this handcannon, and it can 2 tap if you land both double headshots( doesn't always work depending on the enemies' resilience) but it's mostly luck and not really a skill based gun, it is a very satisfying gun to use in my experience however.
---
Google the Marasenna triumphs and they'll show up easily. They're easy to grab, probably an Esoterickk video or two
---
It's a rare-ish drop from the warden of nothing nightfall.
---
For reference, I bought d2 with expansions and Forsaken for 30 about 4 months ago. About a month later, the same bundle was 20 usd.
---
 I later added the annual pass for 25.
---
If you go to see the spider you can buy lumen with legendary fragments!!

Sometimes all you need is to be a Titan!

if this is you, you should edit your full name out...

Ok thanks
---
Yeah, because saying a state of being does not exist when it is well documented to exist in the scientific literature is one aspect of saying science isn't real?
---
its a piss joke...
---
Thank you!

God I miss NLB

---
Playing quickplay as a striker is a great time ngl
---
Lmao thanks man
---
One eyed mask lmao. The super is just like this
---
The hunter helmet though, love the spider eyes.
---
You've snagged yourself a Nightfall exclusive! They're pretty bloody rare, especially a curated roll like this one. Warden's Law is the only "double hit" hand cannon in the game, so it's definitely a good novelty weapon. I'll be honest, it's not exactly a monster in PvP or PvE, but it's certainly not bad, and it is a lot of fun. Definitely a gun to hang on to, even if it's just to leave in your vault
---
What is a lumen?
---
Can you explain the purpose of the vault of glass and how it functions?
---
It‚Äôs the best gun in the game, IMO. Mostly because it shreds like an Exotic but it‚Äôs a Legendary.
---
Weapons from the menagerie drop with it so dismantle them
---
I took a picture of a gif on my computer but yeah that‚Äôs the general idea
---
I see you‚Äôre a man of culture

Warden of Nothing has been there for like 3-4 weeks
---
I prefer fresh mozzarella
---
üçªüçª
---
ah, that makes sense. I‚Äôm guessing these last two weeks were because of truth (though it can be done via the director strike) but if it doesn‚Äôt change next week then I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs the new Hollowed Lair and is unintentionally coming back week after week.
---
It‚Äôs a shader from the menagerie that I believe drops from weapons, I always refer to the destiny wiki on destiny questions like this. Here‚Äôs the link &gt; https://d2.destinygamewiki.com/wiki/Destiny_2_Wiki

I have forsaken purchased on my xbox account, and my main characters there, I intend to come back playing on PC, I am aware I'll be able to use my xbox characters on PC and keep everything however, Will I have access to forsaken dlc without purchasing it on PC? (Already purchased on xbox), Because I've seen this before and it's no point in having all my gear, and when you going to equip "Requires forsaken dlc"
---
I‚Äôm 20% for both medals and doubles. Haven‚Äôt moved in 5 games. I think I‚Äôm gonna kill myself. This is just awful
---
Wowwwww !!!!

Idgi

Mines got Rampage and Feeding Frenzy with a reload mastery and it works wonders in PvE and is solid in PvE. If you're good with headshots you can get two-taps off in PvP 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's honestly just a reliable and fun handcannon, not the best, but still good
---
Okay great I‚Äôll try it out!

What if I were to do something like say, a jump?

Tbh I just mash right bumper until everything around me is dead.

Actually it‚Äôs not too bad üòÇ

Ahhh thanks :)

Agreed. I‚Äôm in pain trying to get kills at fabled tank

If you play three, on reset you get points. I don't recall offhand how much, however.

"Blackout"

Guess I'll play tomorrow

If you play 3 games a week you get bonus glory each reset up til legend believe, at which point you do them to lose less glory per week.

I have not seen these issues on Xbox yet. Hopefully my luck keeps going

Assuming you‚Äôre a solo player, I felt your pain.

Use arrowhead break.

I run the cloak and ace of spades specifically for him
---
Im literally 500 glory away from revoker and cant get it now cause of the matchmaking. I just dont get why I get a penalty for leaving a 2v4. Who isnt going to leave a 2v4 tbh.
---
Problem is that none of that works in competitive. They'd use a shotgun and put you down.
---
I've been seeing couple posts about people complaining about titan grenades. Not sure why when you can do that. That was a nice grenade placement
---
Me and the boys getting nerfed. :(
---
Just bought this a few hours ago. I‚Äôve never been more happy (,: Thanks Bungo
---
It's really insane. I'm currently sanding a model hawkmoon that I printed and damn... When they say hand CANNON they mean it. The thing is legitimately longer than my forearm
---
Someone probably popped an Eververse consumable before hand.

You're welcome :)

Ohhhhh okay that makes sense. Kinda forgot about those even existing. Still glad I got that emote tho.

That's just, like, your opinion man.

If I already have Destiny 2 with all the dlc and buy Shadowkeep would I get the current annual pass?

Wardcliff is basically just a big shotgun with extra boom, and it‚Äôs great for killing supers. So yeah, do that. Especially if you have it masterworked.
---
‚ÄúNice ~~marmot~~ grail.‚Äù
---
All right now he can drink ginger ale!
---
looks like armor that would fit dark souls as well
---
The Warmind.io list is wrong I‚Äôm pretty sure
---
Ah yes, the exotic bullet-less shotgun
---
Light level is disabled in comp, you can run a wardcliff with 200 light or something and still kill with it. Only infuse if you want to run wardcliff in pve stuff or iron banner

You have to have a fully upgraded chalice to get the catalyst, and it‚Äôs a guaranteed drop.

BTW the reunited siblings triumph from black armory also requires 500 Izanagi‚Äôs Burden kills, so you may as well do that at the same time. There are much faster ways to complete it though, especially if you‚Äôre a hunter.

This individual needs to be helped considering we already lost someone in the community from things these two accounts find to be tools to poke at people, and this kind of harassment on players not so strong willed could be detrimental.

After staring at this ceiling for about ten minutes, because I have nothing to do at 5 am in the morning, I thought they reminded me of [this](https://youtu.be/YHirkSmJcEU?t=72), but I was mistaken, because there is no worm poop on the ground. Oddly enough, in the same quick google search, it led me to [this](https://www.wanderingjustin.com/glow-worm/). It's exactly that. I'm going to sleep now.

I am no destiny expert, but I can see that you casted your melee with the super, failed it, and the enemy casted his melee after that killing you

Yeah that while modes a nope for me dawg.

It‚Äôs glitched out, it‚Äôs frustrating. I saw someone mention crouching helps

it‚Äôs glitched :/

and titan, europa and io are real planets/moons as well

I still use sometimes Ghost Primus in raids with NF and Prospector. Or Darkest Before in PvP.
---
Destiny Souls
---
That‚Äòs the point. I casted my Melee (which obvs hit him, you can tell that by seeing it and also heering it. There is a sound like a ‚Äûclonk‚Äú which only appears when you hit an enemy.) but he did not die. Hit-reg is sometimes awfull an leads to moments like these here.

Pocket launcher

I really need to masterwork it, I got it day three black armoury forge with surrounded and threat detector so I chucked a boss dps on it and its been with me ever since

Gambit would be a good place to start, the biggest part is learning the trajectory and velocity. As well as how long the grenade needs to travel before you can manually detonate it as soon as possible. What class do you main?
---
Touch tips
---
Agreed!
---
Same can be said about their Kill-clip fetishism.
---
It‚Äôs the hard truths, the crucible smg, got wicked range but horrible recoil, thankfully it‚Äôs got zen moment so all I gotta do is tap em a couple times and that recoil is gone
---
Yea that happens I've taken screenshots like this that look like amazing backgrounds
---
Super useful for holding off the back flank when you're trying to peek down a lane. Trip mines, like in real life, are meant to hold down a lane you can't keep your eyes on...when I think a lot of people just like to throw it where an enemy currently is.

FUUUUUUUU

Same archetype, but it‚Äôs the hard truths submachine gun from crucible

It does the job. As long as you can hit headshots every sniper is good imo xD

Probably just didn‚Äôt load all the way
---
I am quite enthusiastic about the ships in d2, maybe I can help.
---
1.)How many thrusters did it have?
---
2.)what colour were the thrusters
---
3.) Did it look like it had rabbit ears?
---
4.)how big were the thrusters?
---
5.) Did parts of it look like a cabal ship?
---
6.) Did it have wings on it? If yes, where?
---
More questions to follow after these have been answered.
---
You couldn‚Äôt post a screenshot? Or at least a better picture?
---
Sorry it doesn‚Äôt meet your expectations
---
That's what all our eververse payments were going towards, they were building a traveler to send out.

‚ÄúNo‚Äù *chucks you out in the street laughing maniacally*
---
*Bangs in the door for literal hours on end*
---
You can do the wins in normal crucible stuff
---
It has MUCH further one hit kill range than most shotguns
---
Um whats the problem with using a scuff controller?

It doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt benefit though. Remember that they said human life spans tripled during the golden age.

I got a weird response one time. So earlier in the match this kid had his titan super and I tethered him going close for a shotgun kill and he killed me with the chaperone. So next time around I saw him, switched to my handcannon and just kept my distance and teabagged him as time ran out and my team won. Kid was laughing and said GG and he was dying after he teabagging me and we were messaging eachother some cool positive messages back and forth. I have hope for the community even tho some people are toxic asf
---
A lot of times it isn‚Äôt meant for one. I can‚Äôt count how many times a pillar or corner of a wall, overhang, piping, etc. turned a full wipe super into a single kill or worse.
---
Thog dont care
---
As a BB hunter sometimes you just get yourself in a sticky situation and reloading isn‚Äôt feasible at the moment so you just fuckin panic and slam your super
---
Not sure i usually just go on the xbox store and read the descriptions. There are alot of editions but bungie is cleaning that up going foward

The salt comes from constantly saying stuff to try to help people only be ignored and called an idiot, when I am right. Then someone else says it louder and then "WOW OMG THIS GUN/STRAT IS AMAZING!!!!!" Obviously it's kinda annoying, and this isn't the first time this happened nor will it be the last
---
Out of curiosity what's broken about pvp?\\
---
thanks for the reply :)
---
I haven't actually used One Eyed Mask after the nerf it got a while back. It's still the best option?

Haha same, the damage for some of the hunter nades is terrible, polenta probs wonder why they are getting tickled
---
Yup. Happens to me all the time
---
Ok ill check when i get home thank you also is cross platform going in Destiny?
---
Why so? I would want to know my own past.
---
Bungie has the OXA machine...

But we could be resurrected with no memory of who we were and we‚Äôll forget everyone that meant something to us in our life as a result.
---
r/noearthsociety explain this
---
Returning player here. How much point do you get for the weekly reset and how do you get that ?
---
I completed that quest on my hunter. I want the armor but I don't know if I can handle it two more times.
---
If anything it gives inventive to ge for nf, as that has the range more fitting a 150 making lunas still a pinacle (doesnt suffer bloom, and has maghowl) while nf has both those and longer range. I personally still use my lunas cause ill prolly never be goodenough to get nf, but it pairs nicely with my revoker and i didnt have to adjust much when the change to 150 happened. (Have almost racked up 1000 kills on it this season, vs the 2 1/2 previous seasons where i got 2900 kills. Its still very usable, but it is very much so set apart from nf
---
True.
---
I've been playing bottom tree Striker Titan w a grave robber/swashbuckler Imperial Decree, and I am just punching/reloading without end
---
Completely agree.  I just finished that horrible GL quest for the mountaintop with the double kills and "calculated trajectory" trophies and I con honestly say that I absolutely love the Fighting Lion now.  Once you learn how to use it I was getting crazy double and triple kills with my dodge spamming Sixth Coyote.  I still use it even though I finished that quest step, too much fun.
---
Im guilty as charged
---
Don't forget the alien crystals found on Titan
---
I was wondering how we got the Triumph when two people were dead during the second run...
---
Be cool if we got like a clan castle or something
---
I'm aware of this I'm talking to her
---
Space's haunted
---
I wouldn't say dps but one of two things, either x amount of damage while using honed edge or 500 kills but higher levels of honed edge give better progress and so do headshots
---
Available all season
---
Reeeeeepost
---
I get that totally. That‚Äôs why I love the chaperone because 1) the range is crazy, and 2) it rewards you for making the headshots.
---
so ..umm...hypothetically...if I was trying to lose 10 lbs....about them glucose transporters...enlighten me.
---
NICE
---
It‚Äôs the crutch super that takes 0 work to get a kill with. Atleast some of them require aiming or roaming to get kills. I feel like hunters do it to farm the salty tears of their victims baha x) I‚Äôm tempted to make a hunter purely for this monstrosity
---
Are you sure you‚Äôre human? That‚Äôs amazing, congrats
---
It‚Äôs a head smashing experience
---
Sleeper bro, not whisper
---
Oh absolutely but you can't have fun without a little danger
---
Yeah, and that guy with Lord of wolves was playing super aggressive, him and the rounds they had supers was a nightmare
---
Its honestly not nearly as bad as the mountaintop. Lol
---
Lmao. Same shit happened to me once. I couldn't stop laughing. It was fucking hilarious!
---
Yeah but it takes more energy
---
bruh just wait till next week, it might be awhile, but man is it worth it then jynxing it
---
Damn I actually didn't pay attention to that
---
No, guardians, I'm pretty sure that is the Noisy Cricket. MIB have infiltrated our universe.
---
Toland the Shattered is a unique case in Destiny lore. Where most characters with extensive references have a very traceable history, Toland is pervasive in the lore, but with next to no information on the man himself.
---
Let me explain.
---
There are 104 entries in the Toland the Shattered category on Ishtar-Collective, but nearly all of them are him imparting knowledge of the Hive to us.
---
Toland was a Warlock who rose to prominence somewhere before the Exile of Osiris (which would totally have been a better name for Curse of Osiris imo). Like Osiris, Toland developed a singular fixation on an enemy of the Light, but whereas Osiris sought the secrets of The Vex, Toland became obsessed with the Hive.
---
The City has a long documented history of zero tolerance with Guardians who dabble in the Dark, so Toland's exile should come as no surprise. Prior to Eris Morn, Toland was the premier source of knowledge on Hive Arcana, and he still is, but for the small detail of him being adrift on the Ascendant Plane and Eris Morn not being adrift on the Ascendant Plane. What the specifics of the reason for his exile were are a bit vague, but he probably pushed things a little too far while experimenting with Hive magic.
---
Post-Exile Toland is almost a blank slate. Unlike Osiris, Toland never created a following, he was a total loner and when he left The City he remained one. For quite some time he remained that way until, in the wake of the failed assault on the Moon, he was sought out and found by Eriana-3 and Eris Morn to be an advisor to their planned assassination of Crota.
---
Toland, somewhat uncharacteristically, joined the Raid team and, true to his word, provided the team with invaluable information during their doomed Raid. Although his fatalistic tone and surety of their inevitable demise wore on the team towards the end.
---
Secretly though, Toland had an ulterior motive (duh). Toland had become obsessed with Ir Yut and her Deathsinger's Dirge. Ir Yut's fabled song would kill any who heard it, but not kill in a conventional sense, as Toland says it was "pinned to the quiddity of death." There was no returning from this form of death.
---
Toland wanted to learn how Ir Yut could sing it without herself dying, and in doing so wished to hear the Deathsinger's song for himself. Obviously it killed him, but thus set him adrift in the Ascendant Plane. His exact current status is pretty unknown, as his situation is unprecedented, but the distinction between him and other Guardians fallen to dark (e.g. Dredgen Yor) is that he seems to have maintained largely noble intentions. He is still a Hive researcher at heart, and most of his messages to us have been advice or knowledge designed to help us succeed. However, he have somewhat subverted his expectations by not assuming the mantle of Oryx, in direct defiance of the Hive's Sword Logic, an ideology he seems to agree with. What his current intentions are is unknown, but we may find out more in the not to distant future with Shadowkeep, not to mention that Toland has drawn the attention of Calus as of late...
---
&gt; You fools! You *disastrous, bumbling squanderers!*
---
&gt; It's not right! Who now shall be First Navigator, Lord of Shapes, harrowed god, Taken King! Not you! You might have been Kings and Queens of the Deep! But you have toppled Oryx and you have not replaced him!

&gt; There must be a strongest one. It is the architecture of these spaces.

&gt; Why are you leaving?

thanks man! could you tell me which sniper this is? It should be timestamped

That's what I've heard, hence why I called it one of the most arduous.

Too soon..
---
Yeah its so underrated imo
---
caare
---
There are soooooo many ways to get them now. You should definitely have enough unless you try to upgrade every piece of armor and weapons you come across.
---
OH SNAP! ALONE AS A GOD! GREAT SNIPER! You get that from levi normal and prestige. Great Sniper as well!
---
As somebpdy who has used the hotline, they don't really help. They are useless robots( the people are basically given useless scripts and arent free thinking.) This isn't the best advice to give dude. It's better tp reach out to a friend or loved one.

Also, lol, the " it gets better " speeches don't help. Because it doesn't get better, it just comes and goes like a tide. Your anchors determine whether you get dragged out to sea or not.
---
My new iphone wallpaper, awesome and thank you!
---
I only care about PvE, the real part of the game. PvP is just a side mode and doesn't determine if classes are good or not. Just cause Titans are good in PvP doesn't mean that Bungie doesn't hate them. Besides OEM and a few others basically every exotic they have is meme tier.
---
There is no other answer than this one.
---
This. This deserves all the upvotes.
---
Came here for the D2 content, stayed for the health tips
---
That‚Äôs just bad resource management my guy lol
---
Honestly, it is one of the easiest PVP pinnacle weapon grinds..
---
Also, never heard of em.
---
Sometimes the bigger group never comes. It's a pipe dream to hold on to a super too long. I try and only use it for a solo if they are supering. But that can also get missed. 
---
Or let's just say I really don't like this one particular player.
---
What‚Äôs the blast furnace roll?
---
Damn! What was your setup?
---
Or just master working one item
---
It's compensated by the insane movement speed to cover more ground for more opportunity to kill with the same return on those kills.
---
That is what makes shiro an enjoyable encounter it requires skill and team cooperation if we don‚Äôt get these kind of encounters we get an issue like scourge or wrath of machines where everything can just be blown by not challenging you or your team.
---
This will save and help my son out so so so much because his Halo 5 Edition just very recently started to be finicky about its drive and randomly shouts at us. Lol 
---
So glad this will be a thing. He will be so happy to not have to worry about putting the disc back in after he plays Skylanders and stuff as well.
---
the literal same happened to me once
---
I dont get forsaken with it tho
---
Whatever has rampage and/or kill clip and/or outlaw is the only thing that I use as it‚Äôs basically a crutch in pvp and pve imo
---
Each piece of solstice armor had a challenge assigned to it. When you complete the challenge the masterwork slot unlocked and you got 10 cores to masterwork it. Multiply that 5 for each armor piece, and 3 for each character.
---
  
---
So if you have the solstice armor for all three characters and haven't used the free cores you would have 150 free cores.
---
Bitch be for real
---
Get one with archers tempo
---
I think I have more cores than glimmer.
---
It's a bow
---
Ohhhh, I get you. I thought there were challenges still going on now that were available. I misunderstood. Thanks for clarifying :)
---
I completed my chalice of opulence so now I see very little need in ever opening the barge chests again.
---
It might not be commonly expressed, but I doubt it's unpopular. Obsessing over meta and edging the last 2% out is for pros, not bros just wanting to have fun.
---
Thats just bad advice. To me it sounds like any encounter that cannot be "1 phased" when at appropriate level is bad, which I 100% disagree with.
---
I liked that you had to keep your cool in Shuro Chi and execute it repeatedly. If you could kill her on the first floor, it would be a joke of a fight.
---
These mechanics test a teams skill to hold the run together over a longer period rather than testing their ability to get to a damage phase.
---
These are RAIDS after all, the hardest content in the game. I personally think its in bad taste to ask for the raids to be made easier.
---
Well, that's anarchy and rat king combined. Too OP.
---
Now that we know this, I guess we are literally Guardians of the destiny :D
---
Please, wetsand those headlights............
---
Decree
---
Is that fusion rifle I see yo I have equipped the loaded question? You should be using that to kill bosses machine guns do terrible dps
---
You‚Äôre Breathtaking!‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Also, since I'm still getting headshots for the second to last part of the Luna's quest, LoW makes that significantly harder. I've lost way too many gunfights I should have won otherwise.
---
I haven't seen this first hand myself as I am already digital but I found one of the posts that I read that told me this. So I cannot confirm personally, but I am saying this based on the reports of others.

Hotlines are bullshit
---
Looked him up. He honestly never should have had a following and shoulda stuck to a real job.
---
It‚Äôs on a very long list of things to do. 
---
Bought it super cheap. Blown up. And absolutely thrashed and neglected in every way. And have SLOWLY been working to put things back to original status. I planned to order the OEM 2002 HIDs rather than wet sand cracked and abused and neglected shit lights. But they are much further down than several other things that need to come first. Plastic looks are a much lower priority than controls arms, all the cars bushings damn near, a couple body pieces. So much.
---
Cores? Lmao jk I dont have that much
---
Well, I'm glad you would like to spend your time fixing a car with that many problems, not too many do these days. Good luck.
---
Hello Mr. Technical. Let me try to break it down so that you aren't upset over LITERALLY nothing.
---
Forsaken was the start of year 2. To play everything that was in year 2, you need Forsaken and the annual pass. Forsaken is a standalone purchase and does not include a year of content. The "annual pass" adds the other 9 months to make it 1 full year of content. You yes, the annual pass adds 9 months of content on top of a 3 month stand alone purchase.
---
Thus converting your 3 month purchase, into a year of content.
---
That make your little head hurt less?
---
Meanwhile I have 12K Shards..
---
I will have to keep an eye out and just watch mine when I buy it to see if that‚Äôs the case than. Thanks!
---
Dude, It is what it is, I don't know what else to tell you.
---
He did it because he enjoyed it? Are you really going to stomp on his legacy?
---
My kill counts have less Titans lol this is all just subjective arguing base on personal experience which doesn't invalidate my points whatsoever
---
You do it should say it in the description for it
---
Maybe a silly question but does your friend have the season pass?
---
Its not so much about the hotline as much as it is the thought of what I'm trying to get across.
---
Take my internet point for effort, your first vid, and the nice dodges.
---
The dodge transition at 2:02/2:03... That was dope. Nice job!
---
wym it has good defense is fast does good pvp damage
---
There has been some datamined/leaked information about a possible new dungeon or whisper style mission releasing later this season. The information also contained hints about it being set on the leviathan and ascendant realm.
---
I guess this could be that.
---
Nothing, if it fits your playstyle. I use hc/ikelos/lmg because that works best for me
---
I may be able to take you through a raid this weekend dm me and I‚Äôll send you my psn, maybe we can get you your first raid completion.
---
I think I heard somewhere it does yes
---
I could be wrong but I think 1 pvp kill counts as 5 pve kills?
---
One more reset and dredgen I shall be, god I hate gambit, need three more eggs from last wish raid and I‚Äôll have cursebreaker
---
It did had a great target acquisition on fire hip tho
---
And the instant shot after swapping weapons was great too
---
It‚Äôs not a calendar year, it‚Äôs a destiny year. If you‚Äôre really disappointed with what you got you should pay more attention to what you spending your money on. 
---
If you just made this post to argue about semantics than fuck off.
---
Give Sloane my regards...
---
So star wars
---
Don‚Äôt come for me. Turn back!
---
Thanks, be glad to. Still don't understand why if I join a fireteam on my phone and get accepted, then start the raid I'm alone. 
---
Very good of you to offer. Will DM you
---
Cheers
---
I know which one you‚Äôre talking about, Variks makes this observation when sizing Zavala up.
---
Wait but doesn't nighthawk overpenetrate, or is that just d1
---
I watched the RIP the light out of my best friend.
---
I‚Äôm only level 20 and power level 150 so I‚Äôm pretty new
---
I‚Äôm making an edit with that scene now, you have given me work to do
---
Remember that we still have the Lumina quest coming. I‚Äôd be surprised if it didn‚Äôt have some Menagerie centered objectives involved in it.
---
I‚Äôd suggest playing rumble if you just need to go for kills and aren‚Äôt getting set back by deaths. It‚Äôs less hectic and you generally only have one person to focus on per fight (just pay attention to your radar in case someone is trying to ambush you while you‚Äôre fighting someone else).
---
YES!
---
Idk where you are getting that PvP is more popular than Raids from? Cause im pretty sure it isnt but regardless and I don't think a class being good in a mode that amounts to a side mode. Sorry not sorry but PvP is not what the game is built around. The game is mainly a PvE game and if the class isn't good in PvE, the main part of the game then they aren't good regardless of if they are good in a side activity that has no bearing on the endgame of Destiny 2.
---
Thank you for the advice
---
I appreciate it greatly. Im always honest with myself and others if their concerned about my well being and how my mental state is going, i feel like when you ignore the thoughts they could grow into something problematic.  I will contact some one next time. I promise.
---
Not **in** a galaxy far far away

But in this one

---
today I believe
---
Daily and weekly
---
Yeh
---
No problem dude it's a bitch of a quest tho just a heads up lots of grind not hard
---
I got 3 questions.
---
The menagerie is the annual pass thing that gives 690 gear right? So if I do that and get the gear, should I just do powerful gear quest rotations like I normally do until I get 750?
---
Also what‚Äôs the point of raids if this strategy is available? Do raids give something else then?
---
And lastly, when should I do the menagerie? Because I have 2 other accounts that are around 500 light but they haven‚Äôt finished the forsaken campaign. So do I do the menagerie after I beat the campaign or before?
---
Thanks
---
I never raid. Cant stand jump puzzles. Im at 750 and have great gear. 
---
So sure. No worries.
---
That‚Äôs great to hear. I‚Äôm guessing you grinded powerful gear quests ? Or did you do something else?
---
the week before cayde died me and 12 other people lined up and did the odd dance (or whatever dance says its caydes favorite) one of my favorite tower memories.
---
Thank you
---
Core gain is easier now than those scrapper bounties. Banshee doesn't always make pve players go pvp. That weekly strike/gambit/crucible one is easier unlike forementioned bounties that for poor non-meta pvp players are easier. I really think that it is easier to do crucible quest steps during Iron Banner with also the Banshee bounties. So overall to me, the core hunt is easier. Not to mention if you didn't grind destination gear, there is a higher chance now finding cores and MW destination gears than before. You got excessive amounts of resources and want fair core hunts, lvl up destination packages and start dismantling them after buying. Then go farm more chests/resources/events and in no time you will have that source back to normal.
---
Sometimes people just gotta go.
---
Embrace the Praxic Fire!
---
The power surge quest will give you 690 gear on all your accounts.... so all characters will be 690... as for raids they give you special weapons and an exotic weapon unique to that raid...

1k voices-last wish

Anarchy-SOTP

Terrabah- crown of sorrows...

That‚Äôs part of the issue why they had to bring in the reins on Full Choke. Any auto shotgun with hipfire, slide, and full choke was a god roll just because they could laser similar to LoW.
---
The meta is a lot healthier nowadays minus that, minus sidearms and to some extents scout rifles seeing almost no use.
---
No they shouldn‚Äôt, use your collections m8
---
What scene?
---
how painful, it can't be worse than guitar errors during petras run
---
And so ravager casted himself from the highest point of Olympus
---
Just speaking out of experience, but don't use guided game, use bungie.net, log in with your account and go to "find fireteam". Posting something along the lines of "NA Nightfall 100k" gets me to people to play with real quick.
---
Bungie is no stranger to elaborate marketing campaigns. They‚Äôve done similar shit like this when they still had halo
---
Just play the game and have fun.....LFG is a good tool to help with stuff... just remember some people can be jerks and expect you to have 100 clears for a raid... join a clan that will also help out
---
Finally I can one bang supers with the catalyst and it isn‚Äôt game breaking
