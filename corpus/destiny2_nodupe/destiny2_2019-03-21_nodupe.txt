Nope

---
---
it‚Äôs wide
---
Don‚Äôt make me cry
---
Honestly tho if I didnt know my teammates any better, u would've thought so too. Also it was just that round.
---
üò≠ this is beautiful and a super creative/thoughtful way to propose. I‚Äôd deadass cry if my future girlfriend or boyfriend proposed to me this way
---
For my hunter: poker (by electric light orchestra)
---
Fast and exciting but willing to risk it all 
---

---
For my titan : Danger ahead (electric light orchestra)  stunning birth you can never catch with a hint of impending danger as days till by
---
Yep. That‚Äôs the issue for me as well. 
---
Yep i do now but thats not exactly the point, the point is make them re attainable or dont even make them lose-able in the first place ( still dont understand why they did that.)
---
Having a full invader gambit prime set is like being matt.
---
Destiny Item Manager has a review system that might help you see what's absolutely trash (I can't remember what ratings out of 5 positive, neutral and negative are, but you can find it in settings). You can also look at the perks for all your gear using it. For stuff that you can't decide, take a look at /r/sharditkeepit.
---
I second that. I like following instructions even though he keeps calling me snitch but I'll overlook that.
---
it's not a matter of which mode you're playing, that part is clear, but the terminology for ranks that are apparently mode specific. Either way, no it isn't "hard" to hover over play modes, but yes it is still absolutely bad UI and UX
---
So awesome üëç
---
Dont quote me on this as I can‚Äôt find the source right now, but I‚Äôm pretty sure prime engrams can indeed proc exotic, but you get the exotic engram instead. So whenever you‚Äôre supposed to drop a prime engram, it would have a chance to give you an exotic instead. 
---
"We have such sights to show you!" Is all that comes to mind here. 
---
So there‚Äôs nothing I can do? Damn 
---
Same. It‚Äôs amazing
---
Ah that makes much more sense, might be how they actually random drop these days, would make sense how they have random perks on armor and how they always powerful 
---
Fuck you, its still broke. I'm blaming you personally for this failure.
---
it's gonna be arbalest
---
Good luck!
---
Hope we like it? You better hope she likes it. (But really man, that's awesome)
---
This isn't an LFG sub.

Rule 13.

Check our LFG thread on the sidebar, and also the Team-up Tuesday megathread on /r/DestinyTheGame.

This is a masterpiece 
---
no lol earth is flat xD /s
---
in reality i'm just fucking stupid and forgot time zones exist.
---
Amazing absolutly legendary
---
Thanks, man!
---
Use your fists
---
*opens engram* The Vow
---
Sorry, my bad
---
Look, I got no real beef with you. We are on a website talking about video games. 
---
But I‚Äôm going to give you some unsolicited advice as an old man who had to learn everything the hard way. You need to let go of the need to be right. It will make you miserable. Your opinions and knowledge and beliefs are your possessions, they don‚Äôt define you. It‚Äôs okay to be wrong. 
---
If I asked a hundred people to read your post I‚Äôm sure pretty close to a hundred would have the same reaction I did. It was rude. My attempt at a joke is normative socialization, I‚Äôm letting you know that your behavior is outside the norms of the cultural space you are currently in. The downvotes confirm what I‚Äôm saying. 
---
But you didn‚Äôt ask why I was poking fun of you or why you were getting downvotes, you doubled down and have twice now refused to acknowledge your tone. Either you really believe it was fine or you realize it wasn‚Äôt but refuse to admit it. 
---
I doubt it‚Äôs the first one. That takes a special kind of dumb and I don‚Äôt think you are dumb. 
---
You aren‚Äôt what you wrote. You can admit it was wrong. Success doesn‚Äôt come from always being right. It comes from always trying to be right and learning from those times you are wrong. 
---
As a young man I was lauded for being smart, and it left me always needing to prove I was the smartest guy in the room. I couldn‚Äôt afford to admit when I was wrong. It‚Äôs miserable. I try to go for kindest now, and the only vote that counts is my own.
---
I don‚Äôt know you. All of the above is based on three paragraphs you wrote, so feel free to dismiss it. But I was an asshat as a young man, and as the saying goes, we can smell our own. If these posts are typical of how you deal with adversity, then know you are choosing to live life on hard mode. 
---
You can be better. 
---
Pray to RNJESUS or perish.
---
Be sure to paint the outside yellow, that cannot be less than Exotic! 
---
I met her before Destiny was released :P
---
Thanks!
---
Well if you get access to one I can send you the file!
---
Thank you! 
---
Its CUP.
---
Anual pass gives you all content up until this coming september. For 40$ canadian (I believe its roughly the same value in AUS) so until then you will be on an even playing feild and content ammount as everyone else. 
---
I honestly think that that's a problem as well, they did the most wonderful thing with most of the thorn Quest. You can choose how you complete the quest. I don't know why they don't do that with more items. Cater to both sides and make both sides happy. I'm not going to say that one side or the other has it better than the other side but if you're going to divisively split your player base like they have, you need to plan for it.
---
Looks like if i don't grab the deluxe version i miss out on the ace of spades gun from the exotic stash. I'd assume there are better guns out there that are somewhat easily obtainable?
---
If you get that early it'll be under leveled by end Game?
---
It‚Äôs not the gun just a skin
---
You can still get the gun
---
This meme haunts me. Please stop.
---
just hope her brother doesnt shoot you 
---
awesome. Thanks for the info
---
So, more micro transactions?
---
Do you have any of the dlc. If not your max is 300
---
I mean I got them both first week and I have limited playing time. I don‚Äôt disagree. 
---
Thanks for taking mine and another guys joke from a couple of hours ago, super cool of you. 
---
did someone make this joke earlier?
---
More accurate title:
---
 Titans using any super
---
Make sure she joins the Aeon Cult
---
I agree. I think it's great they have so many ways to level up but I would rather just play the new content with my maxed out character and gear. It's grinding for the sake of grinding. I would rather have the weapons all quest based with really hard requirements. 
---
Didn‚Äôt know. Reached fabled before I even got the win percentage for recluse.
---
The nine found you worthy!
---
I mean, you were standing right in front of two enemies and they did not notice so they suck too.
---
I don‚Äôt think you suck, I think you‚Äôre legit just blind lol
---
Not Forshotgunn. 
---
So that's how Destiny Mobile would look like. üòÇ
---
It says users have no option to change the flair for me 
---
I've heard of people getting the quests out of order, but I have also heard of people farming vex for an hour and not getting the Izanami quest, and then killing like 2-3 fallen and getting the gofannon quest. I'm not sure if those who unlocked Izanami first were just misremembering/mistaken or not. 
---
Lol, backpedaling? Against spectral. Yarite. Can't even outrun it full sprint.
---
If only the blindwell matchmaking were like that.
---
Oh my
---
Are you missing a campaign mission maybe? As soon as you kill ghaul and collect all the rewards at the tower it should trigger curse of osiris and warmind. And after those it should trigger forsaken.
---
Who needs anything else when everyone gets their super over and over again from orb production? You can nearly run abilities only this way.
---
She says nothing of the sorts! We‚Äôre just.. uhm... *friends!*
---
They weren't shooting at me so I figured I was shooting at the wrong guys.
---
What's the NES-zapper lookin one above Sunshot?
---
Holy hell this is my fucking list of reasons I can't get TLW
---
I can, I just won't get it all back
---
Better Devils
---
Sure it's not optimal but it's my favourite subclass. I don't worry myself too much with the meta unless it has a severe impact on my performance.
---
...da hek
---
It looks nothing like the version I'm familiar with, is it an older or D1 variant? Either way, great work on all of them.
---
 Nope, better devils is D2, and it‚Äôs a pretty accurate model, except for the decals on the side
---
Aaah gotcha. IDK why but it just looks less blocky here than it does ingame. The decals and glowing cylinder are the big giveaways ingame, and this lacks them, so I can see how I'd make the mistake I did.
---
Your post wasn't removed because the content shouldn't be addressed. Rule #1 states, ". . .or anything else that does not encourage some sort of discussion or reaction." Given that the content of your post was mainly ranting and not actually discussing the problem you see as serious I flagged it. Rule #3 states, "No use of explicit, racist, obscene or vulgar language, images or messages." Your post contains the line, ". . .use your fucking Well on the bridge." Which is vulgar language against people you were upset with. 
---
Simply remake your post following the guidelines of this sub and there shouldn't be any issues. 
---
Not Forshotten
---
I know I shouldn‚Äôt say this but a curse from you is all that I would need right now 
---
New ringtone
---
Beautiful 
---
Besides being kinda lopsided. the ratios of the individual parts look fine, and the core looks great
---
Any questions?
---
Can i still get this figure somewhere?
---
Definitely make a titan, having 2 of the same class is useless since the 2nd one won't be getting rewards that are as powerful as the 1st hunter's so they'd be useless. In my opinion CoO is pretty boring and useless, I'd only do it on one character so I can get the forge weapons. 
---
Warmind campaign isn't that bad so it's worth doing on all 3 characters because of escalation protocol which is very fun, and make sure to get sleeper simulant and polaris lance, as well as whisper of the worm and all the ikelos weapons. If you use the boost you'll skip both of these and It'll count like you completed them but for some reason I don't have the polaris lance or sleeper quest on my titan (which I used the boost on), not like it matters since you can transfer weapons.
---
Get as many legendary shards as you can because you can buy enhancement cores with them and planetary mats can be good for farming npc items which can come master worked (more enhancement cores) and give you gunsmith mats (I always have  at least 500)
---
TL;DR:
---
Do CoO for the forge shotgun(perfect paradox) but otherwise I think it's useless
---
Do warmind cause escalation protocol is fun and gives you good weapons, as well as the exotic quests that have very nice rewards. 
---
Boost might make you skip quests tied to campaigns (happened to me, might be a bug) 
---
Get a lot of legendary shards so you can get everything else (including enhancement cores). 
---
Yeah they fucked reckoning idk what they thought :/ just make it a 4 man pre matched activity 
---
I mean you said it not me... but my God lol. 
---
Haha. Yeah the current approach most have is to run tight around corners, slide at someone's feet, and shoot them point blank with a shotgun.
---
It's a cheap and effective way to get kills but infuriating for the victims as there little time to react.
---
Drifter: "Shin Malphur has been spotted in the EDZ so go play some Crucible"
---
Me: "What?"
---
That just sounds like Merciless but with extra steps.
---
I agree, but I think Gambit is much worse. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of PvP but I kinda like going against by fellow Guardians for fun. Gambit just feels like too high of stakes and makes me hate the opposing team. I know I should just not play it, but what am I supposed to do in this season then? PoE was fun because it was purely PvE. If you messed up, that was your own fault and you could just do it again with ideas of how to do it better. With Gambit there is the random element of your enemy team and even if you take the strategies and play the PvE element as best you can, there could still be that one player on the enemy team who is a God with a sniper and make you lose all your motes and heals your Primevil up to 100% ten times letting the enemy team win. I would much rather prefer a Gambit without invaders, or just a rehash of PoE in D2 than the current Gambit Prime. Rant over. 
---
So you are complaining about being matched 2vs4, but Alt+F4 those games yourself leaving other people at 1vs4 and new people to join a 2vs4 like you did?
---
The matchmaking (and other things like starting matches without 8 people in the first place) sucks, but you are effectively part of the problem at that point.
---
It still causes input lag, maybe it's not noticable for a casual player.
---
tfw golden gun could only kill guardians if 1.they have no ghost anymore or 2.if the golden gun is using a thorn bullet.(yknow, like the one shin gave uldren to take care of cayde)
---
Remember friends that instantly turn on you when you don't do what they want, aren't friends, they're using you! 
---
I really hate your rng....*cries in no anarchy til 52nd run*
---
It will get worse trust me since most skill based matchmaking will pair you with shitty people to "balance" the teams skill out. That or loading times will be longer to be more thorough which i doubt.
---
You mean the peacekeeper?
---
Yeah it just seems that were getting the same content, but have to do more work to get it.  I busted my a$$ to get Thorn in D1, just to have to do more in d2.
---
Hahahahahahahahaha! Thanks for sharing that! I really needed the laugh! üëç
---
Just watch the Houndish video, he had these all this morning.
---
You who never experienced true fear
---
Nice, a double drop. I got The Getaway Artist from a random ad in the Castellum today, right after Devrim Kaye gave me my Polaris Lance for flashpoint reward. Day before yesterday gambit rewarded me with an exotic and next game I unlocked my 21% Delerium üòé.
---
I HAVE IT! Not sure how to check how many forges it took, but I think I'm over 30. For those that are fucked with RNG, hang in there and keep trying! The gun is insanely strong, also in PVE.
---
I'm about three quarters of the way to unlocking 21%, hope it's worth the grind? 
---
1k I'm going for next, but I tihnk I'm gonna wait for the April update! (supposedly, they are gonna buff drop rate of 1k)
---
Same here, finally got it :)
---
Because you can pretend you're doing a kamehameha or yell "IMMA FIRIN MAH LAZER"
---
Or is that just me? 
---
Hahaha yes. Been trying with those frames since the start with 2 characters every week. Finally have it now!
---
I spent about 10 minutes trying to come up with a convincing argument. So here it is:
---
Backpedal off a cliff. They can‚Äôt kill you if you‚Äôre already dead.
---
if you ever get bored of picking on noobs in quickplay there's a competitive mode
---
Banshee drops vestian dynasty
---
dude the perks and such the weapons have are rolled upon drop. which means you can't reacquire those specific weapons from collections. it's not an issue at all.
---
Basically. 
---
Yeah that's just that gun but doesn't solve my problem does it? 
---
You cant recraft legendarys with random rolls, only rare weapons with fix perks 
---
No
---
It isnt
---
Also chaos reach actually looks fucking amazing
---
[removed]
---
Gambit prime weapons can only drop from completing certain actions in gambit prime, certain milestones, certain bounties and reckoning tier 2 and 3.
---
I certainly think so, overflow has given me over 250 rounds in the magazine! Not as good at burning the Primeval as I hoped but awesome for ad clear and reckoning. Not quite as good as thunderlord but it frees that exotic slot for something else.
---
I wish the enemies killed by the explosion from Celestial targets would generate more super.
---
Something to make it less boss-only
---
*X-files theme begins playing*
---
Those guns have random rolls on them. This means you cant get them from the collections, otherwise yoi could keep getting random rolls and get a god roll
---
Lmao. It‚Äôs the only way to win. 
---
Because you can melt guardians. And top tree nova can be really easy to avoid.
---
Not if you use it as a shut down
---
And what about pve?
---
Lmao, it‚Äôs the only way to win
---
Caveat, I generally run 1kv in gambit so not surprising it does less damage.
---
I‚Äôve just gotta get 1k, black talon and lord of wolves on my hunter
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/b3nm9b/ib_grants_glory_rank/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link
---
Hope she likes it.
---
I‚Äôve unlocked the Gofannon Forge, but haven‚Äôt done an ignition in it yet and the Izanami quest dropped for me (currently working on it).
---
I think they might‚Äôve only done that for the Shotgun , as the SMG and HC are arc and void.
---
Lord of wolves looks a bit more appealing after the buff, black talon because I like swords, and 1k is just an accomplishment thing. 
---
The main exotics I use are Izanagi‚Äôs burden, Jotunn, Last Word and Raiden Flux.
---
I‚Äôm a bit too lazy to grind for thorn, anarchy looks okay, but I REALLY want liar‚Äôs handshake.
---
can you post the files and stuff to this?
---
Hey when you think about it 1k has damage overtime
---
Anarchy is honestly really overrated. 1KV is better IMO.
---
I'm hoping the arbalest isn't the exotic listed on the roadmap. I want a new meta changer like a decent auto rifle/pulse/sub machine/etc. Hand cannons are getting old and other archetypes should be given a time to shine.
---
I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve logged off from a PvE run gone into a PvP game the next day and not realized I have nighthawk on
---
‚ÄúOh I have super I can wipe at least the 3 guys around this corner‚Äù *fires one shot and dies*
---
Lol, yup. D1 when I started playing crucible I was running .2kd on a regular basis. 
---
What about with skull of direakrahma (or however you spell it)
---
Someone needs to repair a certain banned gun.
---
I won‚Äôt tell if you won‚Äôt 
---
Yeah op said "nerf spectral blades" but it is actually this exotic that makes the super this good so his focus is a bit off you know. If you had half a brain you would have got that.
---
But slova bomb with skull deals more damage
---
Why can't I have opponents like this üòÇ . Is there bots  in d2? 
---
Thanks for the input, I‚Äôm currently working through the Gofannon quest just to be sure I don‚Äôt waste hours farming for something impossible. Might kill a few Vex here and there just to check though
---
Yeah, how many did you get? Cause i heard somewhere that only one drops per day. Can you confirm?
---
You can also use lucky pants on a hunter to reverse it, try it w/ tlw as well and they just get an even faster QuickDraw
---
It looks like you're trying to be bad 
---
It was a reward last season for completing 3 weekly milestone bounty for the drifter.
---
I think what he's getting at it since word of crota came first wouldn't the Duke be based on the word of crota? 
---
Good luck!!
---
To be fair, Thorn is kinda relevant to the plot right now.
---
Beside, it's not like more exotics....
---
Ok I was gonna say "It's not like more exotics are gonna hurt anyone" but then I remembered the Crucible and realized that statement is very much *not true.* 
---
Rocket launcher is Bellowing Giant a Scourge reward. So a pistol
---
You want food?? Too bad, you get hammer instead. 
---
So was the Duke Mk 44 It came before WoC
---
I think IKELOS is missing from this picture 
---
This can‚Äôt be real right? Like you faked it? How is it even possible to be this bad...
---
**LAWD** 
---
Awwwwww ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I'm surprised they still haven't changed dust rock and retold to slug shothuns, honestly the easiest way to make them "fair and balanced"
---
Pretty bad description. Not clearly what it actually means.
---
Oh, I only knew of threat level
---
Very nice 
---
Stopping a shoulder charge or a shotgun ape with The Last Word feels amazing.
---
I swear Bungie just hate Titans. They had one good super for a month and they nerfed it. Warlocks have it best with Skull and Slowva bomb and Well and Phoenix Protocol. Literally endless supers so long as you have the adds to kill and Slowva is still great for boss melt and you can switch out to Luna boots for boss melt Well. 
---
Get a valor streak and then play comp. You dont lose your valor winstreak in comp and will get max valor pts even for losses.
---
seems like we got 5163 ghosts to gift the spider. 
---
For me it's
---
&gt; I'd really like to get a ~~good~~ Blast Furnace too.
---
I've just come back to the game in the last few weeks after stopping just before BA released, and I haven't seen a single Blast Furnace yet. I thought it was a raid weapon until this reset... Maybe I can finally patch over my crappy Go Figure luck via meaningful grind.
---
Did not know that ty ;]
---
TIL you could be bad enough to the point of it being legit comedy. I‚Äôm dying rn. 5/7 would carry you to LH
---
What are you using to design this? It's looks nice and it's a thoughtful idea if she's into D2.
---
then realizing you are doing the trickster strike
---
Currently on the malf quest step where you get fucked if you lose moths. Everytime we get invaded a little bit of pee comes out.
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs crucible ranks, right? Two separate ranks. I wasn‚Äôt aware it was a bug though. I say keep it! Some free shards and a tiny sense of accomplishment - although very confusing if you aren‚Äôt aware of it and going for fabled
---
It's the honors of the nine shader :)
---
Destroy this cute little creature with 36 cluster rockets and a couple of 1-shot golden guns
---
Thats valor lol
---
Arhgh gimme the Malfeascanse ornament
---
I aint no snitch
---
So this is what my teammates are doing. I always wondered. 
---
Drifter or praxic order you mean ? 
---
Of course I choose the drifter. 
---
That makes sense. Most people have three characters and only choose vanguard with one, so there should be roughly double the number of guardians in drifter's gang than the vanguard.
---
I went with Drifter. Cayde would want us to still aid the Vanguard but somehow I feel deep down the Praxic Order is not the "good" guys. Just to much out of place in the lore. It seems to me the Praxic Order believe they are above all. I'm not ok with that. So Drifter is the logical choice to me anyway.
---
Some people just like to watch the world burn.
---
Drifter ftw
---
Is no bug, apparently the boss fights rotate each week. The oryx type fight was last week in t2 and t3, this week it's the knights. The oryx boss drops something like the SMG, auto, pulse, HC and grenade launcher...knights boss drop the others 
---
Old new. Eververse bundles.
---
Yes but as a guardian he won't die forever and we could kill him again and again from multiple different angles until jimminy jillikers has lost all meaning
---
Why?
---
\*gathered concern\*
---
That‚Äôs so cool!
---
I would think you're pretty unique among most people being able to hit bulls like that. However, I don't think that's the skill level needed to get a last word.
---
For example, I don't have a Luna's. I have an average KA/D of 1.5. I finished the last word first week. I think a lot of people are around the same level as me and many much better. I get romped in competitive often by those better.
---
I think a lot of destiny crucible players charge too much and trade lives. Watch your radar and play a little conservative and it shouldn't be too bad for anyone. 
---
Please do us a favour and stick to quickplay.
---
didn't get one this week
---
Ohh I guess that's another reason to choose the Drifter. I also don't like people who think they are above all. Really annoys me :/ Now I'm kinda sliding towards the Drifter's side hahaha.
---
But why can‚Äôt we just get the Thornament now tho? ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Hahaha I'd hate to be one too
---
I will watch over you from above, my child.
---
It's not really vanguard it's aunor and her problematic  friendos praxic order. 
---
Also drifter because
---
1 I ain't no snitch
---
And 
---
2 D I N G
---
stream it here if you can man, and good luck dude!
---
Please say more, I don't think he will turn on Guardians who don't support Darkness, while yes, he believes walking between Light and Dark as long as you don't move too much towards Dark is fine, but I don't think that he will go against those who don't support the idea, and want to stay pure Light. Trying to learn as much as possible, so please inform me more.
---
You're not forced. Last word and thorn are both PVP weapons. If you hate PVP you're not missing anything.
---
If you reduce the challenge to receive something, you're reducing the reward as part of it is the accomplishment. It's like if I worked for hours in an old Nintendo game just to get and extra "congrats!" screen at the end. It doesn't really mean anything but I want that screen damn it! 
---
Keep in mind, I've only read the Shin Malphur Destinypedia page.
---
Why is it always Hunters fault üòî
---
To be completely honest here I don't even know who or what the Praxic Order is. Im guessing its like some government or organization who stands above all? Is this from the first Destiny game? Bc I never played Destiny, just started from Destiny 2. Please no flame.
---
Is this fake? Looks like someone pretends to suck to me
---
Your poor gf
---
Your valor is ranking up as your glory is. 
---
I hope I can remove them? They don't look good
---
Never gets old and yes.
---
It's really nice
---
I'm not sure what u mean. But I mean that I'm on Glory Rank Brave and getting rank up messages for Fabled
---
Hey my nick is inflames I can't do that.
---
Also I think it's completely new because I never heard of it either 
---
I was expecting a third wood coffin with ‚Äúall titans‚Äù
---
I'm going for fabled, but I'm on Brave getting rank up messages for Fabled in my same Glory rank. I'm grinding comp so I'm not playing Valor at all
---
3 months salary.....
---
Aaaaaaand blue pants 
---
Yh, fabled in valor lol, you get both in comp
---
Hold on. Are u telling me that my Valor and glory both rank up at the same time? Because that's cool
---
Lol, guess we wait for more D2 content to find out. And thanks for the comment :)
---
Yes. When I started playing comp awhile ago it confused me as well. 
---
LMFAOOOO
---
2 horrible exotics, nice rng tho.
---
Nice dude
---
I was the tether hunter myself v.v
---
Yes only shotgun so it wouldnt work with tractor
---
That's a really good point. I enjoy both aspects of the game and although I come from a mostly PVP background in shooters, I find myself playing PvE much more often. Crucible does need quite a bit of attention.
---
I was thinking about how you mentioned difficulty of quests. I personally don't mind a difficult quest. Not a grind, mind you, a challenge. A lot of these are far too much grind than challenge.
---
What about instead of easier PVP quests, they did harder PvE quests? I want more than an emblem for soloing shattered throne. What if it was a step in building an exotic? I know difficult challenges like this would drive players crazy but then things like Jotunn wouldn't be RNG. Power should be earned. 
---
Bad juju would be pretty damn good in today's hand cannon shotgun pulse meta
---
Eyes of a dragon.
---
Definitely! 
---
Damn that last part is cringy.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
This is the most endearing thing I've ever seen on this sub
---
 ‚ù§ 
---
I don't think you're necessarily wrong but there's obviously much much more PvE content than there is in crucible. Entire worlds, cut-scenes, strikes, raids, and story missions. If you looked into it, PvE content is the bulk of what's on your hard drive. I know PvP was planned from the start but it's just a handful of small maps and barely differentiated mechanics. If they focused on PvP equally we'd get more than 6 vs 6, bigger maps, better modes. The things every PvP focused game has always done better. 
---
Bungie - "due to unexpected gravitational effects in Reckoning we have temporarily disabled guardians' ability to jump during this activity. Also we will be reducing the base damage of fusion rifles."
---
How much do u play....
---
Well I've seen enemies flying away before, but not myself :D
---
nice repost

It's used for Kalli cheese to make her not be able to move xd

LOW is REALLY good now.

The worst is when they split right as you kill them. I think an easy fix is give them a cool down on their split.

Thanks.

Easy there, Satan.

No, just Wii motion plus

Well, with certain roll outlast (new pulse rifle from gambit prime) feels very similar.
---
Love it, especially later in the season.
---
Yeah my wife got it on the gambit submachine gun and has been tearing up mobs. 
---
I was grinding for the Ace, and Thorn at the same time, but I'm never going to get Thorn!
---
It's a theory that a lot of people have been looking into since a lot of lore seems to back it up. He attempts to use cayde's death as a catalyst to spark our growth into the guardian he thinks we can be 
---
Ok I‚Äôm too tired to full respond at the moment so I‚Äôm just gonna take the big one, and thats that i agree with you on the fact that i don‚Äôt think it should be handed to us, i like the fact that its hard, and I‚Äôm not trying to complain about the fact that they made the quest to hard, which they didn‚Äôt. Im trying to say that this one specific step is anoying as all hell and that I‚Äôm probably going to complain a bit about it, not becuase i want it made easier, but just because I‚Äôm anoyed and want to vent somewhere
---
Hey man(person/girl/internet celebrity), you‚Äôll get there, I skipped last word and went straight for thorn and finally got it yesterday.  But I also remember how many years it took off my life in D1, this was not as stressful.

1.5kda would be above average in my clan.  And way above average for anyone who is mostly PVE and just does crucible for powerfuls and quests, I suspect. It is about double my kda and I am usually 4th or 5th when I play rumble. 
---
If you are 1.5, no PVP quest should be particularly difficult for you. But there are a whole lot of people under 1 for whom it is quite like hitting a bullseye. 
---
I got tlw but it was by no means easy. At a .63kd and .8kda, I worked for it, played a lot of games, sunk a lot of time into it, lost a lot of progress, and changed how I played to get it.

Chaotic Evil should be The Architects. They've been the most evil presence since the beginning of Destiny 1
---
Thats really great! Its an awesome gun so go crazy and enjoy!
---
I do agree with some of these but i have a few things to say. Firstly swap lawful and neutral evil, use better quality for chaotic evil and not gunna lie buddy whether we wanted it or not weve stepped into a war with the cabal on mars. So lets get into taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc.   From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold. Thats all
---
You suck so hard you emit it as an energy that effects other players. Well done!

 Just watched Konosuba english dub. I was impressed with the VAs. They did an excellent job on that show. I cant wait for the 2nd season to be dubbed. I love the english VA cast. I love Megumin. Sometimes i yell "Explosion!!" with my dragonfly spec'd SR3

Maybe because some of us don‚Äôt like the other supers for pve?

Could you list the armor your wearing? it looks great.

This one is on commission actually, I‚Äôm going to figure out a good price when I finish this one.

Lol, I have to redo the cost, but I‚Äôm thinking $425 because of the ungodly size of this beast

I mean isn't that pretty standard? In a perfectly balanced game everyone would have a 1.0 no?

Lord Shaxx wouldn‚Äôt take sides in this situation

I thought that all you needed was a Well 'lock and a Tether Hunter and you could run whatever else you wanted?

Apparently I‚Äôve missed something during my time away. What dis be aboot?
---
Yeah mate I agree 
---
this is ridiculous! Contact Bungie support I'm sure there is a way to get in touch with them on their website. If possible make screenshots of the messages you got from other players to show why they *actually* reported you. I'm sure they gave false reasons.

You shouldn't be punished for playing the game this is just unfair

There's a quest where you have to choose between the Drifter and the Vanguard. I believe is an annual pass only quest though.

AHHH right i think i get what you are saying now but i do hear you saying 'how do we come back from that?' and i say: you dont. Welcome to a world without light.

Also competitive is called competitive for a reason. And gambit prime was outlined as a more COMPETITIVE version of original gambit. And I also agree with the fellow redditor who responded to your butthurt post.

A that shards of galanor on spectral blades?

Theres a couple hunter pants that make your crotch larger or smaller

You don't, it'll track on hip fire. I have been wishing they'd change it and make it this way, though, but I think the ability to abuse the tracking is intentional, to separate it from grenade launchers

There have been times where I‚Äôve played with/against the same bots week after week. I know because I recorded them and reported them.

I don‚Äôt know if bungie does anything at all about bots, but I can 100% confirm they don‚Äôt act fast even in the most obvious cases.

I got the game free in November, Forsaken feels more worth the money than the base game would've been worth from my perspective

Honestly would be better if it was raining motes as well

the way to get lunas and not forgotten is grinding the rank first and then do the quest. btw service revolver with kill clip is like lunas howl without neutral game

Nah, I'll just wait until a quest or something asks for me to complete the bounties, Thanks though.

Not much reason for immortal warriors to protect humanity. We're not our previous lives right so we're also not human. We are light encased in human/awoken/metallic shells, specifically not looking into our former lives but for some reason still protecting our former race. Guardians should be looking out for themselves not humanity.
---
exactly, they barely scraped enough money to buy their lunas and quickplay stacking is the only way they can pretend to be good at the game

Is this a humor post?

Been around since Black Armour was about to come out. 
---
It‚Äôs from the forsaken OST, title is Watchtower
---
There is, you gotta go fast. The cores will pop when the boss hits certain health levels, 2/3 and 1/3. camp the core ports with a shotgun and do the first two as quickly as you can (bonus meme the cores have a massive aoe so you don't really need to hit the boss) and when he hits 1/3 rush to the last core, blast it open, and chuck the core at the floor. It should reach. If you're fast and have a shotgun you can do it. Source: I rush heroic a lot, the prisoner murderers usually leave when heroic pops
---
I dunno lack of skill and commitment paired with a scrub mentality of making excuses is a pretty big hurdle to overcome
---
Your title says the server's down, blueberry. Just keep proving my point. You can't even read your own post?

You can‚Äôt dismantle them. You can use them one every half hour from your inventory or use them to make armour. That‚Äôs it.

You don't like playing the game? Not to be mean, but if you are really into the game you can bang out the grind in a couple weeks and be back to max level. I'm like half into it right now and just comfortably leveling and throwing on my random dumpster gear to clear reckoning. Infuse a couple guns once or twice and an exotic piece and you're good. You know prime engrams drops are not based on what you have equipped, right, so your hobo gear just needs to sit in your inventory. I would hate if a new season dropped and I had the same non-existent incentive to be doing any milestones.
---
For example: I just got the catalyst for merciless. Its not the greatest gun, but it's fun to use. It's actually been a blast using it over my erentil in crucible and over my loaded question in strikes (that I'm running a couple times throughout the week for LL (ty bungy)). When its filled up with kills I'll use it a bit more with it's powered up stats until I go back to using my endgame, legit gear. Its simply fun to play Destiny and I like when bungie gives little incentives for doing something a little different than you're used to. If you wanna complain I would stick to how D2s nightfall system removed exactly what I was just talking about from the game. Or how they set the farm up for the new prime weapons in the grindiest, least satisfying way. Grinding LL is a core mechanic to destiny, as far as its come from slaving over VoG to get a helmet or forever be LL 29, it will always be around.
---
That's not a picture of Fatebringer though.

Chaotic neutral is definitely failsafe.

Just okay better and they aren't an issue, if you know they're using NF or Luna's, use cover and flank, get the jump on them.

Not that hard

They changed it before release not to be confused with the tv series with the same name I believe. They were calling it that before the official title was released though! :-)

Good Doggo emote 
---
160
---
It's not just paid emotes though. My friend was interested in this ship some guy had until he found out it costs $15. 
---
Taken armaments from Last Wish and Fallen armaments from Scourge of the Past. 
---
They are very rare though. 
---
The taken mods from last Wish can only drop from 2 chests in there that are hidden between encounters. The first after Kalli under the bridge and the second after Shuro Chi cloning the side of a cliff. Then it‚Äôs a fairly low drop chance for a taken mod and it can be one of several different mods. 
---
Fallen armaments is from the hidden chest in the sparrow race encounter only and again, low drop chance and is one of several mods that can be pulled. 
---
You can get the last Wish chests solo with just using the Wish wall. Can get both on warlock or titan but hunter can only get the first one. 
---
The Scourge one you will have to do the encounter with a group. 
---
GAH! You‚Äôre right!!
---
which emote specifically.
---
Cuz I think you're talking about the limited time primatic matrix thing that let you purchase season 1/2 emotes for money.
---
If that's the case, they aren't paid emotes. They were available from Eververse in Seasons 1 and 2, the same way any other emote is obtained.
---
I just completed this last night.  Here are some basic and very obvious tips:
---
  
---
\- Gambit Prime gives you more points since they have more envoys that pop during the match
---
\- Infamy thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9mqchk/gambit\_infamy\_rank\_chart/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9mqchk/gambit_infamy_rank_chart/)
---
\- Infamy can be earned pretty fast if you do all the bounties
---
\- Play more Gambit Prime :)
---
As long as Eververse deals in cosmetics, or offers an in-game avenue to earn anything that affects gameplay, I don‚Äôt think it matters if people pay money for its goods. Micro transactions are a reality of modern online gaming (and nowadays they have constant upkeep costs), and Eververse is really one of the better models out there since you can get almost anything without spending an extra penny. 
---
Slova-bomb warlock.  You'll wipe out each envoy group with a single super and often have your super back for the next one, if not the final one before the primeval damage stack.  It also helps with the multikills if you hadn't already done that.
---
The iron banner emote and dog emote are paid only. 
---
I'm all for OP weapons man. I don't have either of these guns because I'm not good enough at crucible. You guys who do have them are good enough and deserve an ass kicking weapon. 
---
But post is about how to fix the weapons because it sounds like they will be "fixed" with some kind of nerf. The dude is just giving his opinion on why they need a nerf and how he would do it. I don't think that's being salty. 
---
Now, I haven't used the weapon myself, so I can't say for sure... but isn't it POSSIBLE that the gun isn't THAT good ... its just that playing enough to get it happens to leave you with SO MUCH crucible experience as to be a pretty good PvPer?
---
There's a Dog emote?! why wasn't i told about this!
---
"Spectral Blades is fine. PVP is supposed to be difficult"
---
"OEM grants 8 seconds of tracking, it's OP"
---
"Thorn is too hard to get"
---
Did you guys not get the hive-mind memo? This subreddit is for complaining about things and posting pictures of gear/characters at 666 light. 
---
Also, I'm pretty sure screenshots are bannable content. You have to take a picture of your screen instead.
---
that's some good lulz

I don't know if it trumps the fallen captain fortnite dancing though,  I may have had nightmares about it.

---
If you check collections, the only set roll for plasma is public defender 
---
Of the current season shells I only have EDZ perks on my sunshot shell which suggests you can only get planet rolls + the guarantee

Also the companion app and DIM falsely display all these seasons shells as capable of having two speed demon perks selectable

You need to upgrade your mote synthesizer to legendary I believe. Other than that the level requirement is 690, so it's convenient to be at least around 680 when attempting this.
---
look here boys, we have us a genuine dickhole.
---
Kindly fuck off.
---
You need to minimum power/ll 680, but the recommended is 690. This week you'll want Arc damage stuff if you can help it.

Really dude? You‚Äôre getting offended over something in reddit. Grow up.

Ah ty, i think i need the legendary Synthesizer:)

No new raid?

Like, for the first time ever since Forsaken I saw someone with fully masterworked *armor* yesterday. I‚Äôm amazed there isn‚Äôt even a discussion of how pointless masterworked armor is. Like, it should give or upgrade enhanced perks to make them even more effective, not like 2 or 3 perfect more resistance to an element. 
---
That's a good one, can't believe I forgot that. 
---
Take it away Ikora!

...
---
Subtle. Bring it back!
---
THIS IS AMAZING!!!
---
Fucking incredible hahahahahhaha
---
I even forget about SotP

Real talk: Why are all of the other species only males? There‚Äôs some hive wizards and Riven but I mean basic enemies.
---
The whole theme of the end of forsaken was us giving into hatred and not sparing Uldren. Zavala told us there would be consequences "maybe not now, but someday" 
---
I think Uldren will probably be demonized and convince some of the awoken to fight the Guardians
---
Looks cool, I may have to draw one myself. 
---
On a side note I just got this exotic last night so take my relatable upvote! 
---
I would actually use this

Meh I‚Äôd give anything for them to bring back something like the Mantle of Efrideet.
