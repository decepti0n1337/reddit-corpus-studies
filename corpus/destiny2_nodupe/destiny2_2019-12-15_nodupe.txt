What's that chestpiece and how do I get 20
---
---
---
There’s like a fixed thread with the best rolls for each gun. If you can’t find it there but you want to know if yours is any good you can post it asking for help. 
---

---
If you search using the name of the gun you will probably find several posts about it
---
Unlink the one you have linked then link both it should work then. Took me a little while to figure it out.
---
Rapid fire frame new sundial Auto Rifle ... it sooooo good
---
U/keenmetirl
---
Don’t know if this is good evidence for you but ps://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/691087-playstation-4/75897718 as for Xbox that’s my console and they take up the same space
---
Don't worry that's exactly what you should be doing outside of melee range. Bullets track better when you aim down sights. Even with perks hip-fire and free hand grip you still ads.
---
Ding!
---
Dont mind the trolls. After massive exposure to salt levels on r/DestinyTheGame rivaling the oceans, most people lose the ability to be polite.
---
Lul imagine bragging about having a homing knife when I have homing fists XD
---
i haven’t downloaded a disc game in a while, was probably just remembering incorrectly
---
*eating crayons*
---
Talking a lot of shit for being in golden gun range
---
Okay, that shit is AIDS.
---
Yup, started having that issue after the last update too. 
---
It’s really annoying since I have a tendency to do other things when I’m going from activity to activity... or waiting forever to queue into a game of gambit or crucible.
---
Do not play crucible.
---
a lot of sidearms aren’t that great. I wouldn’t bother. This also is not the god roll.
---
If you enjoy using it just use it but don’t masterwork it.
---
Should have put hunters
---
well yes, but actually yes
---
The refreshing taste of a Pepsi
---
What emblem? I’m fabled too and I don’t have an emblem
---
It's always been there.
---
They make them scented for a reason
---
These accounts that post are dummy accounts anyways right? They would have to hire someone to actually go all the way till they are invited to the REAL team and then ban....which to be honest is not going to happen. Also I mean think about it the peeps paying money to get these weapons, think about how much they are spending in eververse. That should answer yr question as to why this is not being taken more seriously.
---
Ok so Titan have shoulder charge one hits, hunters have precision knives one hits. Is there anything for a warlock to one hits?
---
Only part 1 of it
---
You can unlock the obelisks, but you can't actually run the sundial without the pass
---
Nice
---
It part of the quest step. It’s similar to the final steps for the crucible and vanguard
---
*guest
---
There was plenty of ammo. Just pull out IB and profit.
---
Oh yeah my bad
---
Nice bot
---
It's....a little too easy to use right now.
---
I am an average PvP player, and even I was like, "are precision hits supposed to be this easy with this?" when I loaded up my Hunter and took it for a spin
---
Not Arbalest?
---
IB with it's special shot. Dies super quickly especially with the weapon of light buff. Then did the same thing to the walker.
---
You too?
---
It be like that sometimes
---
For that talon emblem?
---
I really like Gambit. But I dont like the most Teammates.
---
Hurry before he takes your motes
---
Rest in peace guardian. Say hi to Cayde for us.
---
Have u seen the Scatterhorn armor?
---
You don’t have Hush
---
Shoulder charges shouldn’t count as melee kills. There’s a difference between guttural looking and mashing for the kill while you’re both in the throes of mortality and sprinting and pressing a button.
---
This has to be the best reply
---
Exit Strategy
---
Bygones is pretty good too
---
What about hush?
---
But it's really fun. Went back and did it on my hunter (had it from titan maining.) and used last word. I dropped my last word to pick up a last word without ornament at a lower power. Sad.
---
Someone came up against a assassins cowl hunter
---
Yup it's bait to coax you into buying the expac.
---
Technically I think it's also necessary to unlock the patrol zone too but mostly bait.
---
I felt that
---
IM GETTING TO IT! ... eventually
---
You used the Last Word to get the Last Word
---
It hurts us all
---
Whips out *malfeasance* haha hey buddy
---
ok thank you
---
What do you mean?
---
I troll them lol
---
What
---
[deleted]
---
What is a good kinetic sniper
---
Thank you. Response to the meme has been incredible. I was laughing the whole time I made it.
---
Now I just want to tape the Valkyrie to the front of a sparrow and ram something with it.
---
Sorry I typed that at 8am
---
I know, but that’s really the only thing randy has on it in my opinion
---
960 is soft cap. That means its meant to be easy. Any higher will be because of the artifact
---
Wtf... I don't think I'm following.
---
I CANT BELIEVE WHAT I'M SEEING
---
It's a amazing gun and that is one of the best rolls
---
The 3-dimensional shape war is on the horizon
---
It’s also Kinetic, which is much better. Mindbender is much better than DRB.
---
Pretty sure the aim assist is better as well
---
So the history channel barely covers actual history anymore apart from weekdays during daytime tv. At night it becomes all about conspiracy theories.
---
Anarchy

24:02
---
Handheld Supernova shouldn’t count as grenade kills. There’s a difference between guttural looking and mashing for the kill while you’re both in the throes of mortality and holding the grenade button.
---
Same
---
My soul
---
Im pretty new, can someone explain this to me?
---
Kind of. The ending cutscene is a good cliffhanger, but the rest of the shadowkeep campaign is just like all the other ones before it: kill bad guys with boring dialogue and cutscenes, run around and do events in new place, do final mission.
---
Haven't touched breakneck after the nerf but I've been really enjoying exit strategy, it's a pretty solid gun imo
---
On the bright side, you're lucky you were not shooting a grenade launcher at the time.
---
Perfect paradox is really good too though.
---
I wish i had teammates like you :(
---
They said it will return with an alternate way to acquire it in the future. This sounds like they will either add to global exotic loot table or a quest. You cant get it right now.
---
We are also talking about timed when adding something like this wouldn't cost 10s of millions their is being cheap then chairs doing something financially stupid
---
The knifes man the knifes haunt me all day
---
I love Dance Gavin Dance! Name them Mess after Jon Mess! Mostly joking but that’s an adorable cat! I vote for the name Petra!
---
But no quickdraw
---
Tbh don’t think there any stronger than titan shoulder charge
---
Can you imagine the mindfuck on that guy?
---
I think D2 is processor heavy. That’s probably your bottleneck.
---
Kinetic Boogaloo
---
Hair game is stronk with this one
---
These are always so nice I love the tangled shore
---
Spike grenade launchers, hammerhead, 21 delirium, anarchy(used for glitching bosses usually), and then it just depends on situation
---
Well a titan shoulder charge cant kill you across the room , plus its so easy to get those headshots.
---
Play around strikes, crucible, and gambit. Use rainmaker if you have one. If you want some exploration, patrol provide some glimmer as well.
---
Edit: season pass early level also provide 5k glimmer on certain level, so you might want to do bounties to level up the season pass
---
It was easier for the elits because they where humanoid and the amount of animations they had to replicate was minimal at best the fallen not so much
---
I ran into this too. Bungie has made it standard practice for location-specific bounties and quest steps to specify that location. This quest step should adhere to that standard. Unfortunately it does not.
---
What were you throwing with left hand after throwing weighted knife? Hunter is so cool with that knife.
---
Get the campaign’s from Amanda holiday and just play those
---
Can I use this template?
---
And if you miss then you need to wait, where with shoulder charge it doesn’t get used, and hand held nova bomb has a huge radius, but throwing knife is very precise at the bonus of being regenerated
---
[You are wrong](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/254653532).
---
I did it on console and it took like 2 hours
---
Armor doesn’t matter. It’s about stats, and the energy - stats is ability recharge and health, energy allows you to apply mods. Unless you’re asking about exotics, which is a much more complicated answer. 
---
PVP hand cannon...Kindled Orchid from the Forges. Midnight Coup from Leviathan. Thorn, an exotic with a quest. Crimson, an exotic that drops. Service Revolver, which drops from strikes and Zavala. For KO and SR, you’re gonna want perk rolls that help in PvP...search the Reddit for conversations about those. 
---
Sniper...Shaxx and Crucible matches/rankups drops Fate Cries Foul. You can craft Beloved in the Menagerie. If you do run Leviathan, look for Alone as a God, the second-highest aim assist in the game.
---
They didn’t drop the ammo this season - they just raised it last season.
---
Why do I see an influx of people using double primaries
---
Pretty much all those questions are answered on Youtube. Look up current meta(i.e. recent) hunter build videos.
---
Shoulder charging them straight into Reddit Therapy. 
---
SorryNotSorry.
---
Are you me?.. At this point my Titan usually has a higher LL due to the Pinnacle gear from Iron Banner.
---
&gt;an amazing pvp, pve, and co-op in one game
---
This is what I thought at first, but this is the first game I've ever played as a lifelong gamer that got stale within the first week of playing
---
It was a great quest but I agree that last step sucked butt.
---
We already know from datamining that he leaves the tower at the end of the season... :(
---
The last part alone? I’m
---
Sorry that must have been frustrating.
---
Because Its the Nightfall. Im using Unstoppable and Anti-Barrier for the 2 pulse rifles
---
Is it too much to ask for a hunter poncho?
---
I’ve been wanting a poncho since I first ever saw Hawthornes.
---
Don’t even care if it blocks half my armor.
---
Hunter gunslinger main, this is exactly what I wanted
---
All that or a mix?
---
Genius.
---
God damn!
---
My good man. Welcome to the club.
---
Well 'Empyrean' is going to be a thing in both games soon enough, to further intensify your confusion.
---
Not rude at all, just OP is asking for a good loadout and telling them that you don't need to worry about it isn't really an answer. I understand mine wasn't much better but youtube is a great resource for this kind of thing.
---
I like all of them
---
Also if you have multiple teammates running malletman you can create an infinite battery and supply unlimited ammo for your hammer throwing brethren. I had loads of fun doing that in the menagerie during season of opulence.
---
Still. I think losing someone in the community warrants for more than just 4 letters.

---
Amazing dude. Truly amazing
---
Thank you, I’ll have to do that!
---
Dang, can i remove my own post or do the mods have to
---
I've heard it sucks on console. I did it first try on PC and was really underwhelmed. Considering myself lucky. 
---
Nice.
---
I don’t think it really matters. You could remove it.
---
Didn't even know titans were who everyone bullied tbh, I chose them in D1 because the massive pauldrons just looked awesome and reminded me of WH40k
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Chose them in D2 for the same reason, that and the character transfer
---
Ok thanks anyway
---
So my kill clip outlaw bygones is worth taking out of the vault? Sweet!
---
I’m pretty sure the ex shooting her is just enough to tell you he is a abusive piece of garbage and the fact that you’re making a joke of a fellow guardian dying tells me a lot about you’re character traits you inbred troglodyte
---
It only works when your teammates are competent enough to run 1 primary 1 special. And why would you use leviathans breath to stagger the boss when your unstoppable rounds can do it? Are you stupid?
---
Dang, I wrote that hand cannon off, I'll have to check it out. Thanks!
---
No problem. I also just realised you’re on ps, so I wouldn’t be able to help even if I had forsaken cos I’m on pc. Good luck dude!
---
Thanks brother
---
For the longest time I used Malfeasance. I honestly never saw the problem with it but I'm also a pretty casual solo player so damage numbers and everything arent extremely important to me. I really love the way it handles. Theres next to no recoil and it feels like it fires a lot faster than it should at least imo. I'm also having a lot of fun with Symmetry(its taught me how to be a lot better about precision shots) and being rewarded with a few seconds of high damage tracking shots puts a smile on my face
---
It's all fun and games mocking titans until they stop helping in raids to tank the damage or use the middle tree for the void subclass for uber damage from team shooting
---
Honestly once you’ve got the headshots just play momentum. Kinda cheap but a lot of things in that mode are. Bannerfall is your friend, and get a Beloved if you’d don’t already have one.
---
It would be great if everyone could find d a way to share this to bungie. To honour our fellow Guradian.
---
Enemy :- "ok, I have this tanky as fuck machine gun which I am going to shred with "
---
You :- "imma *boop* you off the map" xD
---
After some testing, it rivals ikelos shotty with the right roll
---
Thats not saying much though, since ikelos has been in a bad spot for a while now.
---
Oh hell, didn't even think of that..I have nezarics sin too...hmmmmm, a godly pve build I'm thinking !!
---
The Unstoppable rounds on The pulse rifle work on Unstoppable Champions, do you not know this?
---
No worries man, hope you find a group!
---
I love me some good vex milk
---
Nah, man, you gotta pull out your big iron and shoot your load.
---
Everyone jumping to conclusion based on one side of the story and I'm the crazy one. What is wrong with you people?
---
Also your suggestion that I should decide who to sympathize with based on the fact that one of them was a Destiny player is highly offensive to the idea of justice.
---
Good thing you didn’t have any crayons with you.
---
Nice one dude. Kinda feel bad for that dawnblade basically wasting a super though.
---
What heavy weapon was that?
---
(Edit: nvm I saw it’s xenophage)
---
Thanks! I imagine a range masterwork on the hand cannon and handling on the sniper, or is it different?
---
Vigilance Wing was the weapon that got me to stick with Crucible.
---
Unstoppable rounds staggers anything, you kinderguardian. It just staggers unstoppable champions 4x longer
---
The hell do you mean by what’s wrong with us you literally just made a bill blur joke about a dead person you are the one in the wrong here.
---
Is that Susan wabajock?
---
Seems like it would favor large mobs. What primary I wonder? I feel like an auto rifle with Osmosis roll would be preferred so you can have an automatic weapon to proc nezarec's with. 
---
Maybe middle void subclass for the health and ability regens for ability use.
---
I'll give it a try, thanks.
---
Biggest brain: celestial snipehawk
---
“Fast travel”
---
To where ? Jesus ?
---
Rest in peace, Guardian Sushicat.
---
it changes what mods can be equipped. (ex arc gives you the vault to equip auto rifle and shotgun related mods). if you google it, you can prob find a chart of which weapon types so with what element.
---
The elements are for the mods, for example you'll only be able to put hand cannon perks on void armour
---
Add one of her characters to the tower as an NPC maybe?
---
not to joke around, but can we get an F for this allen Guardian?
---
F
---
Mods: Refer to ticket 892 for clarification of approval
---
Campaign is quick, just finish main campaign, then work on side quests.
---
I'm calling it, we're gonna get a triangular Darkness Ghost, and he and Ghost will banger and be like Angel and Devil on our shoulders.
---
Ghost: "Do good thing!"
---
Dorito: "No, do morally questionable thing!"
---
Guardian: *doesn't listen to either of them and just does whatever gets the job done*
---
Oh that’s what you mean...
---
So yes the postmaster
---
I love these moments 😂
---
On release crucible SUCKED, nothing dealt enough damage to be viable 1v1 so it just ended up being a slow ass team-shooting clusterfuck. The current sandbox is great imo, high momentum but doesn’t stop you from camping back with a scout.
---
Rest In Piece
---
I’m pretty sure I saw a post like this get removed from DTG. I wonder if it was deleted by the poster or by mods
---
Anyone tested if an empowering rift with max stacks of dynamic charge 1 taps? Would be stupid but fun
---
Acting like hunters aren't the easiest most dominant and most popular class in crucible...
---
It was a repost of mine, and removed by mods yes
---
Yup. My friends won't let me live down dieing after the warsat hit me on mars
---
Well when you do it is usually when you have a grenade launcher/rocket and they jump in your face the moment you shoot
---
That was wholesome
---
I’m sure Cayde will give her a great time up there... RIP guardian
---
They hate us, cause they anus!
---
I can't really say anything though, I play warlock
---
In shadowkeep they changed how armor works, now armor pieces have an affinity and those affinities govern what types of mods you can slot into them. 
---
For example your arc armor piece (say it it were a helmet) can support finder perks and targeting perks, moreover the Arc affinity deals with Machineguns, Shotguns, Pulse Rifles, bows, and swords. Other affinities will support different types of weapons and mods but the rest you may have to experiment. Also I suggest only upgrading armor up to level 5 to start since after level 5 they require enhancement cores to level.
---
Whoever has control of the God Roll spreadsheet, can you please update for Claws of the Wolf (Iron Banner) pulse, also maybe add a column for weapon type?
---
Omg the warsat and the cabal public event on Mars always be hitting me out of nowhere 😭😂
---
no u
---
what do u expect from a ‘Khan’, i mean?
---
For Queen and Country!!!
---
It’s really not.
---
The main annoying thing about it is that the encounters take forever, and there’s no way of making them go faster. 
---
The only hard-ish encounter would be the second  to last encounter. The main arena is divided up into 3 walled off parts, each part has 2 players in it. If shit goes sideways in one of the parts the others can’t help or rez them, and now you’ve gotta start over. Long story short, encounter is pretty easy, but if someone slips up you’re kinda fucked.
---
The final encounter gets a bit chaotic sometimes, but if you’ve got a coordinated team it’ll be fine.
---
That's like some Sherlock Holmes predicting what's gonna happen shit
---
Rest in peace, Guardian. May your light never fade.
---
Would be amazing if Bungie could do a tribute to her. Maybe putting her character in the Tower somehow, so her legacy lives on?
---
But why didn't they bring Cayde back too.
---
I did it, it took me like 4-5 days and god knows how many frame repeats, over a dozen definitely, but I finally did the bounty...for a piece of legendary chest armor with shit stats, for no substantial reason Lol.
---
Ill have to consider trying it now
---
is not comparable as it's a worse shotgun that can be hard countered by map awareness
---
Not myself but Ehroar's video shows it at 10% increase, not mind-blowing.
---
I swear this drop pod flies in from the left and shreds you if you even touch it
---
Eyes up, Guardian.
---
Why would it be?
---
Who knows man
---
But is it always active? Is there a questline I need to do or am I missing something?
---
No, it's an event
---
Just go away, the devil has enough fucking advocates.
---
This issue is being fixed by bungie it was in the most recent twab
---
When is it back?
---
24/12
---
Thanks for the help
---
No problem
---
"Use a different gun bro!!, its a new season." Lol. Please tell me more on how i should have fun playing a game i like.
---
It's been well established that cabal shields defy all laws of physics.
---
That was... interesting to say at least. I expected much, but not something like this. Lmao.
---
May the traveler's light be with you always.
---
-a fellow guardian
---
Dude, embrace the crayons. There is method to the madness; it isn't our fault if they can't see it. Don't worry about the ones that are actually salty and being mean. Just learn to differentiate the ones who are joking in good fun, because those guys are cool.
---
😞
---
I hope we get some more of Cayde and Uldren stories. Maybe resurrect Ace as a guardian.
---
He became a vex to have milk running through his veins.
---
Okay that was a roller coaster of skills
---
Worked for me. Thank you, sir/ma'am.
---
Actually gonna check it out now.
---
We lost many guardians in the past years...i wish Bungie would give us a tribute hall
---
ouhhhh shit
---
Woulda been nice to know this before I wasted 16 resonate stems ... wondering WTF. Thanks, Bungle.
---
Why was it removed?
---
r/whoosh
---
Hunters love whine and cheese.
---
Sick !
---
Haven’t tried it in Crucible yet myself, but given how differently it functions I bet it’ll tear up Momentum Control. Aim for their feet, 20 meters away.
---
I've been wondering that, if I get an exotic at a low level can I actually use it or do I have to constantly switch out armor with high light levels? I read once that the game calculates inventory not what's equipped?
---
I fire bows out of my hand cannon what do you mean
---
Probably is if you have bad aim
---
You need to calm down bro I'm not crying you're just getting too defensive with your shit loadout. And if you don't care why are you still replying?? Just stop caring LMAO
---
alright man, appreciate the help
---
May your light guide others to the right path. Rest in peace fellow guardian. We will try to make your light remembered in destiny.
---
I can help you out, if you still need it. Message me on PlayStation; my PSN is WiltedMashrafiya.
---
If it's really that hard then you don't deserve the gun 🤣
---
Rest in peace guardian
---
I'm not crying, you're crying.
---
That’s strange, I got access to her as part of the new light quest line in the tower. Got access to her after talking to the drifter and getting the Intro to gambit quests
---
Most definitely Warframe.
---
Titans get compared to US Marines who get made fun of for being crayon eaters (idiots)
---
Is it on steam wallpaper engine?
---
It’s the closest thing you’ll get to one in destiny
---
Bruh you could atlesat crop first 10 seconds.
---
fuck, i found out i was following her
---
Get upgrade modules, increase the light level on the gear you want to use. Make sure it has high base stats.
---
Honestly I’ve been playing with Wings before the buff. It kinda annoys me when the streamers start complaining about a criminally underrated exotic that has been around since Curse, saying how it’s basically busted.
---
They do indeed but that is on the bright dust menu, the other silver section is static allowing people to buy what they want whenever, these ornaments do not exist on this silver menu whereas the hunters 2 seasonal ornaments do.
---
I hated that step when I first started, I couldn't hit to save my life, but you get used to it.  I myself just got the 150 pulse headshot kills in 1 hour
---
What did you get?
---
Rather do chasm of screams 10 times solo than playing crucible, and a 100 than playing gambit.
---
Where's that TF2 quotes dude?
---
It's okay
---
I love the idea of this. My frames wont
---
Except it's worse in every way than just using a sniper. Because you've already shot and killed them while they're charging.
---
I was probably a bit too hostile with my response, but shoulder charge takes a good deal more skill than you think, especially with shield bash's really sketchy tracking
---
Nice! Didn't notice but ill take a look.
---
Bro what do you mean bro I totally don’t have a crippling alkane dust addiction bro why would I even snort them out of my hive wizard gf’s buttocks?
---
It's a drop that comes only on curated black Armory weapons from any forge
---
Shhh.... he’s busy......
---
Absolutely incredible! Love this, OP!
---
Been running that this season. It’s fun but kinda meh. Awesome for working down slow/stationary bosses

She will

talking specifically about primarys hete
---
Ye I think it works the same as the powerful gear thing
---
I took 2 months.
---
Yes I'm on PC.
---
It was a Hunter with shotgun.
---
Her: Pulls out a vibrator
---
VEX ON THE FIELD
---
even then you get plenty of time to move you sight
---
What changes would they be ?
---
Im still on crucible kills😂
---
Damn 3 in a row
---
This was pissing me off last night to no end lol. I have arbalest too and pulled it from my vault mid match after dying to it from 3 separate guardians back to back back!
---
You must be new, Or have you just not used it?
---
I’ll take 7.
---
Are you saying all Exos look alike to you?
---
In my experience no one chats outside of party chats on consoles and discord for PC simply because game chat is buggy, laggy, and unreliable. If you are looking to do anything use a LFG and hope someone is willing to help.
---
I want the kind the Hunters use
---
Why do I never get put into games where the opposition act like blind fucking lemmings strolling into impending doom , but don't care.
---
What's the point if you are not playing to win ?
---
Xbox exclusive only
---
People still do this game type?
---
He is actually an informant of The Spider
---
Wait wut?
---
Holy fuck 80 euros for divinity lmao
---
Oof, there goes your entire career
---
I LIKE THE FRUIT PUNCH FLAVOR ONES
---
Yep. It was either two or three.
---
Bungo hates us :(
---
I meant 2 hours for the whole quest
---
I thnk i d nt
---
HOLY SMOKES THATS MY FAVORITE CRAYON DRINK!
---
Symmetry has unstoppable rounds built-in into the alt-fire mode (despite not stating it) so you can use that instead of Randy's if you want to.
---
Only the dumb ones
---
god damn, for the toughest raid boss, and a bugger to beat, that is the most adorable thing i have ever seen.
---
Nah son that's just the dreadnaught
---
I had to zoom in to make sure this wasn’t real, haha well done!
---
PC
---
Arbalest is a linear fusion, so its like a sniper. So not good in shotgun ranges.
---
Only the bad people do this
---
We salute you saint 69
---
Dont need the mods, just match the singe, and dont use white ammo unless its wishender. And bring banners
---
It's not an upgraded Xbox One, it's the next generation of Xbox. Like PS4 to PS5
---
It's pretty op. It fires almost exactly like No Land Beyond, and the wind up is hardly even noticable. If you're good with Arbalest and no land from d1, you're a literal god with ophida. The fastest ttk in game from the largest range. Its op, and I use it a lot. If you're good with it, you can spend an entire gambit match one shotting literally every enemy  and never even shoot your gun. It will map even in the titan gambit arena. Its range is broken for a one shot melee. The magnetism on it is so insane that you almost can't not hit head shots. It's pretty broken atm. Do a liars handshake on prime and if you have 4 hunters you can do half of its health in 4 hits on the first phase and force immunity. Down it in the second. So now hunters have 3 melee cheeses that can basically instant kill bosses. This one is ranged though. It's broken.
---
This is hilarious. Let the idiots pay.
---
I cant tell if this is an effect after eating crayons or not cause i am sorry wtf what is wrong with some people!
---
It's a bug. Bungie has acknowledged it
---
this kind of what the obelisks are.   I've seen some of the perks have debuffs and the like.
---
Happies and slappies, bois
---
Scorn always die in awkward posing positions. Effing hilarious.
---
Def op. Yes shoulder charge is annoying. But you can counter it. Please tell me a counter to this new throwing knife. Especially when it's cross map.
---
Looks like these won't have anything good in them either.
---
Thanks.
---
Purple for sure.
---
Practice with arbalest. If you can get arbalest to a point of shooting people down like this, the transition is so minuscule you hardly notice it aside from the lack of ADS, but the magnetism compensates. Use the sprint arrow, as it's basically directly in the center of where the knife goes. If you can get the sprint arrow over someone's head throw it and it's basically guaranteed OHK.
---
Grape is a good flavor
---
....and rarely at that :(
---
Buddy buddy gotta break it for ya, but it does dealing absurb amount of dmg in crucible and gambit. I just got quite mad when I matched against 6 wish ender whose always left me at 10% hp with one shot.
---
“Hey what’s up guuuuuuuys !....... xxxxx here and today we’re going to be taking a look at.....”
---
Fucking exactly
---
I mean if you cant kill a bunch of enemies with a sidearm, what are you even doing in this game?
---
[removed]
---
Well, you don't *need* the mods or else people wouldn't be able to complete it. Maybe you've had some great luck with teams that focus-fire dangerous targets, but I've seen too many people stand around and blow ammo into barrier targets that are healing up, and people getting ran through by unstoppables. The point isn't that matchmaking needs to be adjusted in order to complete the scenario. The point **is** that matchmaking needs to be adjusted in order to even out the scenario for everyone present so that one or two people don't carry the responsibility of making it enjoyable for everyone else.
---
Lucky! All I get is DDOS’d because It’s 4 in the morning and I don’t want to do the whisper catalyst
---
It’s super rare and those guys probably haven’t gotten it yet. The perk on it makes it so that enemies don’t target you as much
---
never, would render the forsaken campaign useless
---
Low chance drop in Scourge of the Past. It’s got a special perk that turns down enemy aggro to you while riding it
---
Abducted to heaven
---
I feel bad then because someone had like 72 runs completed
---
What did you do after you got there?
---
Crimson hand cannon. Heals on kills and reloads on precision SHOTS
---
Fret not, brother; The Titan will continue to be my main.
---
i legit thought this was a cannon post
---
Having read your description of the creative process, and with the understanding that they’re flat, not round...I believe these ornaments are the real thing.  Please forgive my skepticism... I’ve been so conditioned by clever, fake images made in jest that I thought you were trolling.  Merry Christmas, God bless us all everyone....etc etc
---
Honestly, I think he'll stay dead. His ghost's toast and exo reboots don't work that way.
---
You said and I quote “you don’t have as many” which conotates that one would not have the full experience without gamepass you single celled organism of a man
---
This took me a second... 😂😂
---
Since last driver update?
---
A surprise to be sure but a welcome one
---
I think when making season of dawn bungie just forgot
---
Dreadnaught Coil
---
Shoot precision parts
---
It’s been awhile since I watched him, but does Mr.Fruit do PvP and PvE or only PvP still?
---
If you like yours, by all means continue to use it. I personally feel that a full auto roll on a pulse rifle is a waste of a skill. You missed out on kill clip/rampage or whichever of those it can roll with.
---
Blast furnace is pretty nice, but its a slower firing pulse. Claws is a 540 rounds per minute and blast furnace is 450. The recommended rolls on that are still outlaw/feeding frenzy and kill clip/rampage. Those are pretty much the go to for any weapon really. But its all personal preference on what you want to use. I do have a blast furnace with a good roll, but I'm more likely to use my 390 swift ride or 340 premonition. I just prefer those. Plus blast furnace is a primary slot weapon. I have plenty of other primaries I'd rather use instead for the most part.
---
 Headshots
---
Like headshots?
---
Ok thank you!
---
Depends on the race
---
Happy Spotify cheese day
---
Except for Vex
---
I have a feeding frenzy/rampage Blast Furnace that I like, however the recoil direction can be a challenge on console. I believe its base recoil direction is 65, which gives a little too much variation in recoil to be a top tier pvp weapon, and it has its own sites so can’t roll Arrowhead B.
---
Adding a Counter B mod adds 15, so at 80 although higher it will always pull to the right.
---
Spawn kills are not impressive.
---
I don't think so
---
May she dine amongst cayde and the speaker
---
Have a green crayon.
---
Mtashed new knife juggler vid. 50-some seconds. 57 I think. Play it in .25 speed. That thing doesn't even hit that enemy. He plays on PC
---
It’s a world drop now
---
if you get yellow numbers its precision.
---
I already clear bout the crucible part, I was talking about the 4x on pve.
---
Wish Ender is fine. Did you get all of the coins by beating the 3 secret bosses in Shattered Throne? Leviathan cannot be acquired any longer.
---
It’s funny cause once they get the gun they paid for they still suck at the game and then complain hwe they spent money for a gun that doesn’t save their life lol
---
Nah bro that gun one shots adds and then that other gun one shots adds but has one more bullet in the mag so it’s amazing zomg
---
Nice streak
---
Oh ok thx
---
Hey, it’s Gammatrap! Your art in Byf’s videos in insane, and clearly on here too! Excellent work!!
---
Thank you greatly, for sure you’re doing the right thing
---
Using a sniper only works if they aren't spam charging before peeking for a nanosecond, firing during said nanosecond and aim assisting a headshot
---
thanks for giving me the advice :)
---
That looks exactly like what I posted to r/DestinyFashion about 4 months ago... wait it is!
---

---
Everything. I’m completely clueless on building. Like what’s good for PvE and why is it good for PvE and not PvP? And so on
---
Lol I don’t run gambit armor at all.
---
Now my friend, in the Season of Forge, and for most of the year, the Forges have been activated right where they stand. You really had to go and interact with the forge, as in your picture, to get into the queue for that forge.
---
I don't know what it's like now, but in the Season of Forge we had to light each forge individually with one quest per forge. So a total of 4 times.
---
You could also only make all weapons in the Bergusia Forge, the other forges had a set of weapons that you could forge there.
---
You can find all 4 forges in the open world, two are in the EDZ and two on Nessus.
---
Pvp expect a few dream team videos
---
It’d being done ironically dude
---
You'll probably need exotic armor for most builds. So make sure you're buying everything you can from Xur every weekend.
---
There's a lot of build possibilities depending on what subclass you prefer, what game modes you're playing, etc.
---
Search stuff like "best warlock build for gambit" or "best pvp warlock build" on youtube and see what builds would work best for you and your play style.
---
When you’ve got 74 motes banked and everyone’s deposited except for one guy with 14 running around trying to get 1 more
---
Lmao glad I wasn't the only one thinking that during the episode 🤣🤣
---
Hey, you’re the prokaryote who made the assumption
---
THEY'RE TETRAHEDRONS
---
Could be mistaken but I’m pretty sure it means black armory armor not weapons
---
Lmao I did the same with the season 7 title. I got to 666 games played and quit ;)
---
I only play gambit for quest steps or bounties now. 
---
I suspect most of us do one of the following:
---
Switch weapons to your optimal gambit loadout and go to town, invading until your team catches up. 
---
Cheer that you can now kill some more enemies and make more progress on your quest steps.
---
I used to main Arbalest as an invader in prime, because it also does half decent damage at close range, so I got super used to it
---
Ok, I’ve done that, but I would like to understand building so that I can make my own builds, but I don’t understand building for anything
---
It's a known bug. Not much can be done until Bungie fixes it. There's a workaround that might work but I can't remember the exact steps, maybe someone kind can help out about it.
---
Attunement of chaos + skull of dire ahamkara = fun in most PVE activities. 
---
Attunement of control + getaway artist + a good TTK weapon = fun in most PVE and PVP activities. 
---
Warlock is actually really easy to build for. Just find an ability you like and get the stat that ramps up that ability and cap it off with an exotic combo. Like handheld supernova? Bump discipline and get Contraverse Hold. Like Celestial Fire? Bump strength and get Claws of Ahamkara (and Monte Carlo).
---
I wish, not an antiope. And that's the "hard truth"
---
BADUM *TSSS*
---
Any tips on that?
---
Every time I try blink I end up flying off the maps.
---
We underestimated the floof
---
Bygones is random, the ship is killing the meatball, and the ghost is by having three total resets on infamy
---
OEM Titans &gt; People who want Cayde to be back among us.  
---
You guys are the worstest
---
You know that you are denying people the guns if you do that right
---
They don't go to postmaster so this is a dick move
---
You gotta zoom in and see what I see. Stand where i stood. BREATHE WHAT IVE BIRTHED
---
Yeah so in sundial I'll sometimes run divinity for the bosses in the encounters and then for majors I'll use it to chip away at their health and then throw the knife to finish them off, it's just a fun little way to play
---
At least it's not a h*cking V shaped console
---
If it was warlock it would make sense
---
Warlocks handheld supernova one hits
---
But it's inconsistent at times and slower to charge then the others
---
Really, being a warlock in PvP is a handicap
---
That's terrible :( I really hope her daughter and her family are able to get through this alright. No one should have to deal with something like this, even though horrible things like this sadly aren't uncommon.
---
Dude playing the game is literally his job. If you don't like it then figure out everything yourself
---
Top spec Dawnblade is really strong now. See at least one every game.
---
Idk, it was lucky lol
---
Handheld supernova is a ohk
---
Warlocks are a massive handicap in PvP
---
I know because I main one
---
I always do PvP on Hunter or Titan instead
---
Bunch of people have been having similar issues.
---
I read that its mythic you need to reach, not fabled. Cant confirm tho, havent got there yet.
---
But seems like the quest is buggy for a lot of people.
---
I've only recently begun LFGing at all, trying to get out of my comfort zone and face anxiety, trying to overcome it. The extra stress would be way too high for me to function lol, so I don't do them either
---
Ik but still
---
Slow down buster
---
Rick kackis annoys me only because he sounds like he's talking slow on purpose. I'm ok with a 10 minute video if they don't intentionally draw it out
---
But we could play catch and wallhammer :p
---
Saw a video of a guardian named, “max” using wings of sacred dawn and making people miserable.
---
It only affects the grenade not the flame path. But with this gl all the base stats are really good so no need to worry about the masterwork as much. As for the perks I would replace genesis with autoloading holster
---
Did you play the red war campaign?
---
"We are not your friend. We are not your enemy. We are also not the kind of people where you can just drop by unannounced. Seriously, rude."
---
It's more like a toaster of death.
---
Getting serious Master-Chief-infiltrating-High-Charity-at-the-end-of-Halo-2 vibes from that entrance.
---
This is console which has always been heavily, heavily Hunter based. My kill per class emblem has more Hunters killed than Warlocks and Titans combined.
---
Anway, I finished the Hunter one 3 times and Warlock twice. Big buffs for both classes and Titans really only got nerfed since OEM/Thundercoil was the majority of their neutral game. I was kind of expecting it.
---
It's only good if you are a good sniper and using wings of Sacred dawn, the melee is useless in PvP even with the solar artifact unless using a quickdraw gun and the super is now too slow and it doesn't have tracking like bottom tree, but bottom tree doesn't have anything else
---
The only other good thing is handheld supernova but it's worse then Hunter throwing knife and is on a terrible melee and super, or maybe top tree Nova for shutting down supers, but other then that, hunters and Titans can match them in those areas and outright dominate them every other way
---
Warlocks also lose 85% of their melee fights and trade the other 15%
---
Warlocks are a massive handicap, which is why a good warlock is actually more terrifying then a pre nerf oem striker to me
---
You already have your answers. But you see those two icons in the top left there? The one you hit LT to open up your quests. That bird icon is the icon for season of dawn. Its telling you what to do if you just hit LT.
---
You people do know that the downvote system wasnt designed for telling people theyre wrong right? You already did that in the replies.
---
It's Microsoft's marketing tactic for the new Xbox. I've noticed companies doing this more since Netflix engineered the Birdbox meme craze of December last year. They understand that an engineered meme craze will garner higher amounts of publicity than ads. These companies know younger generations will accept any subtle advertising as long as it comes in the form of a "meme".
---
Just wait for all the arbalest body shot ohk spam
---
Those are rookie numbers, gotta pump those up
---
I’m waiting. Lol
---
Just do it quickly. I did it with a bunch of random. Just make sure your hitting the slayers that pop up and you’ll be fine
---
click on heads
---
Edit: this was pretty toxic, I'm sorry lmao
---
Correct. They plan to launch it at Earth, but they’re waiting for orders to do so. https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/the-psion-flayers
---
...I’m not sure wtf I just watched, but I like this
---
I have a couple weeks off now so I’m grinding it out. Started yesterday afternoon and I’m rank 15 already. Have found 5 exotics and 3 catalysts and also got my light up a load. The only expense to this is my sanity :)
---
This is the way
---
**THIS IS AMAZING!**
---
Dont get gaming burn out. That shit sucks.
---
Even though, according to the lore, our Guardian has more powerful Light than S-14. Very interesting.
---
Haha no worries, just wanted to curb the incoming disappointment like I had when I found the box and saw no option to interact with it.
---
Forsaken is a great and well-worth-it expansion though.
---
I won’t, too much of a Saint-14 fanboy. Even if I do then it means I won’t be playing destiny when it comes to the exams in a couple weeks. So win win maybe?
---
Slapped that upvote button like my mama taught me right.
---
Pretty sure they're trying to figure out what counts as a 'boss' for this quest.
---
Pretty awesome work.
---
Is that logo for XBox or.,, HOOLI?!
---
I've been wayyyy over there. There's not much there. It just seems to continue infinitely. I had gone so far that I could no longer see any lights and it was just very gray.
---
Too bad people did this 3 months ago. This isn’t new
---
do you have it without "Destiny 2"  on it?
---
Trials armor for hunter and warlock were the best for sure.
---
Broooo I’ve been looking for one of those ever sense I saw it in one of their streams
---
Now we ask why
---
known issue 
---
normally they give an item to open these ... floatimg warmind box...thingies... SLEEPER NODES (sorry i derped. xD)
---
gambit dry streaks. that ever happen to u?
---
An epic gamer is an appropriate name for someone like you to do this
---
He's talking about you.
---
Ye
---
Got the chest tho
---
Rip Twilight Garrison🙃🙃🙃🙃
---
It's been bugged since the 10th. No fix yet
---
Use the Xbox lfg. I can always get people for anything on there.
---
Ive actually not seen a single person complain about it. Im actually only seeing people complain about titans still. Which i never understood.
---
The helmet always stays on.
---
This has happened to me several times
---
I have 4 right now, got Riskrunner asap.
---
 I just got the hunter grips and the other gun from Xur yesterday after BUYING legendary shards with my Glimmer from Spider.
---
Yeah they really should cause with that train of thought sniper mods shouldn’t affect izanagi
---
The chest only gives armor and a remarkably slim chance at cosmetics, none of the boss-exclusive IKELOS weaponry - which are the highlight of EP.
---
Why not stay ADS the whole time?
---
It looks like the dreadnought
---
Yes, after I created this post, I realized I was stupid and forgot about that
---
Thank you for enjoying it :)
