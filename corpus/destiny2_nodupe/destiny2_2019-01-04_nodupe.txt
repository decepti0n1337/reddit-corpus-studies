It still didn't drop for me

Exactly what I‚Äôd like to ask.. Where‚Äôs all your Exotics and Armor sets?! 
---
just tried out riskrunner in gambit abd it clears ads like a dream, team just has to pick up motes and bank. and most importantly it clears blockers reaally fast. plus works wonders on right primeval
---
No.

&gt;what's not to love?

It's not whisper.

the truth is no, u cant get them back through dismantling, and if u contact their support they might solve the problem for u.

Honestly I know what you mean the lunas howls quest put my KD even lower because I am lower than average and it suck when you go into comp and you get stomped

Thanks man and I wish you the same :)

My brother said that Thanos from the movie (not comic Thanos) is a purple rip off of Ghaul, and keep in mind my brother isn't a Destiny fan. What does anyone else think?
---
That makes sense and I don‚Äôt have a problem with it, I want it to be hard because if it‚Äôs easy then there‚Äôs no real accomplishment 
---
So I'm this guy that likes to invade a lot with a Crooked Fang and snipe some enemies off. I'm almost always getting 2/3/4 kills when the pull the PE first. Fuck Chaos Reach and the meta. 
---
When you invade at the right time and drive the enemy mental there is always a way to win Gambit!
---
PS. I'm a warlock running Chaos Reach, desperately searching for Geomags

Thanks man but I still have a lot to learn

11/10 a vanguard shader that everyone use as free shard

It stops the wipe mechanic. I think you can only stop it 2 times though. 
---
of course not every 4stack will be the sweaty dwellers but when i made this post i just had to play against 4 stack from the the same clan all using the thunderlord and since bungie is unwilling to accept that the problem with gambit isnt weapons being broken its the wallhacks on invader making certain weapons a nightmare to play against and all 4 were using the thunderlord, these were people not playing gambit for fun but to abuse a certain weapon to get higher ranking

You're right, I just googled for "Cernal Sanders", and it's spelled Colonel.

I'll get a raid done eventually hopefully. Tried getting chests from leviathan but it said I needed keys and I have no idea where to get those

Tbh it'd be way more cool if you started out as a dreg regardless but as you spend more skill points filling out your trees you become more like a vandal and then turn into a captain after maxing out.

The real question is how and why are you walking around with enough motes to summon a prime evil?

For the future weeks, (since you already know this week's) there should be a little bit of flavor text at the bottom of the bounty with an npc's name.

That'll help you out with the location in the future! :)

The rootinest tootinest hunter vanguard there ever was.
---
Cyberdemon?
---
Its literally a paywall, the reason the game is in the toilet.
---
Its tied to the leader who hosted the raid and they do have checkpoints
---
I shit you not I got put into a Quickplay match last night with 11 other solo players and it was a *great match*. Both teams seemed to gel and we basically just TK'd each other back and forth the whole time. Really good time and everyone stuck around to the next activity.
---
Then somehow the matchmaker put all the top players from both teams in the last game on the same team in the next game and a total rout ensued.
---
It's like it hates the idea that we had fun.
---
This is the hunter way.
---
Also the raids reset every tuesday so if you had a checkpoint then you'll lose it
---
Ty! Much appreciated!

Fuuuuck

BUNGIE PLEASE ADD THIS BACK!  HOLY FUCK, WHY DID THEY EVER REMOVE THIS I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND.

Ah okay, this makes sense. I've been using mine to just get gunsmith materials and the like, I think I'll save them now as well though.

The dead space in the Infinite Forrest is terrible. Getting from the main entrance to the ‚Äúpast‚Äù or ‚Äúfuture‚Äù gates is just arduous. And it‚Äôs all for naught bc it has nothing to do with anything.

It's great fun in PvE as well. I like to use it with Nezarec's Sin on a void warlock. Shooting the center of a cabal phalanx's shield causes a poison cloud that kills the phalanx.

You know I‚Äôm actually happy to get dupes, as long as it‚Äôs armor or a good weapon. Because armor has random rolls and I don‚Äôt have 2 of my classes leveled yet so they will have max power gear when I do get there

I got mine by shooting the boss right before it died after i spawned in
---
Got mine yesterday as random drop on mars during escalation protocol
---
Can someone explain
---
a) what is a title and why do you need a shader for it?
---
b) I thought applied shaders are lost during the dismantling process. Can we get our shaders back in some way?
---
Thanks from a D2 beginner. 
---
I want that sniper
---
You have Crimson.It a bit different for a Hand Cannon but It's pretty good outside of Crucible for PvE stuff
---
What shader is that?
---
Wow, Le Monarque is most definitely not garbage. It's amazing in PvP and PvE if you build around it. If you only play with the mindset that you use what is "best" you're going to have a bad time in this game. Sure thunderlord is amazing and there is no reason to take it off in almost any content but me and my friend have had an blast in crucible with le monarque. It one shots with titan slide buff or warlock rift. It's super fun and most likely very annoying to play against.

Flashbacks to gjallarhorn week 2

So it‚Äôs likely he‚Äôs been tampering with then, my theory rn is he‚Äôs preparing to form maybe some kind of rebellion? Playing dumb while he whisks away and tampers with the bot. Or he‚Äôs gonna use them for good somehow 
---
Maybe I‚Äôve got way too much luck (if you can call it that) but I don‚Äôt think Le Monarque is actually very rare. I‚Äôve got two and seen several other people get it, but you do have to be prepared to grind. But you *can* grind.

So y'know how Bungie releases DLC content? In Year 1 of D2, we had Curse of Osiris and Warmind, so weapons with the eye symbol and the triangle'ish symbol in the top left corner of the weapons/armor is referred to as CoO/Warmind weapons/armor respectively. 
---
Now we're in Year 2, the dlc that Bungie released was called Forsaken, and so all weapons and armor pieces would be termed Forsaken weapon/armor. Currently we're in the Annual Pass season (still Year 2), and the current expansion is called Black Armory, so weps/armor = BA weps/armor. Upcoming DLC content (also from Annual Pass) is Joker's Wild and Penumbra, so mid Jan you should start to hear peeps talking about Joker's weps/armor pieces.
---
Also, with Year 2, Forsaken's release, Bungie added back random rolls into the game. Weapons and armor pieces no longer have the same perks forever, every time you get one from an RNG drop, you get it with different perks, for weapons, you might get different barrels, scopes and the perks might be something like Outlaw + Kill Clip, Rampage + Dragonfly (these are all names of perks that you would be able to obtain from an RNG-dropped weapon). 
---
In this subreddit you might've seen the phrase "curated rolls", "god rolls" thrown about. Curated rolls are basically a set of perks that have been pre-selected by Bungie, you can't change any perks/barrels/scopes on the weapon, and it comes with a fully maxed out tier 10 masterwork (The gun image is outlined with a solid yellow border, this shows it is fully masterworked. Masterworked guns generate orbs of light with every multikill. If the border is white, it is at least tier 6 masterwork and above, and doesnt generate orbs)
---
God rolls are rolls that have been determined by the community of D2 to be the absolute best roll one can get on a weapon (and yes it does exist on armor but it depends on your playstyle which is why theres no god rolled armor). God roll combinations include: Rampage + Outlaw (the most classic version), Outlaw + Kill Clip, Outlaw + Dragonfly (only on the Last Wish handcannon, it drops from the raid as a curated roll), Surrounded + Rampage (new version of god roll that has a chance to drop on the Black Armory machine gun) and many more. 
---
Hope this helps and sorry for the absurd amount of text XD
---
You're welcome, enjoy your cake. 
---
Nice
---
Pretty nice drawing there man. 
---
I second this, OP‚Äôs asking a community who enjoys this game, and they would only recieve positive responses 
---
And what do you use the gunsmith materials fir atm then? I've got a couple thousand of those, but those drops all appear to be shit as well. Honest question. What's the use of gunsmith materials? 
---
Add blade barrage + Shards in there and you'll be like "What Primeval?"
---
Yup. I received mine by grinding for roles and because I love the ship. Just finished my 100th frame yesterday. Just make sure you are re-buying the actual forge frames and not the blue frames on the bottom.
---
Started to play 2 weeks ago. I have done all the missions for campaign and most side quest and i didnt get sunshot catalyst. Then I googled it, then it said I had to join a faction but that doesnt exist anymore. Googled when it will be factions and its literally nothing. So anyone that didnt participate will never get anything u could get from factions.  
---
Here‚Äôs what I think you should do. Download the game and play until you finish the Titan part of the campaign, if you like the game, then continue playing. Although, Forsaken (and Annual Pass) makes the game even better since there‚Äôs more gear and stuff to do with them.
---
a) Titles can be obtained for going certain things in the game, once you get one, it will show up under your Name, in Purple. I dont know which one in specific you do need a shader for.
---
b) No, you can buy them back in your collections, Its under ,, Flair''. 
---
SUPER helpful.  Thank you!
---
I don't have any of the dlc but I see legendaries with the symbols in the corner so I assume they just mixed them all into the random drops?
---
The masterwork guns are the ones you recycle to get the rate upgrade parts right?  I think I recycled two not knowing they were good because I finally got two of the upgrade core things.
---
If you‚Äôre level 23 you can‚Äôt equip 600+ power kinetic and energy weapons..
---
It‚Äôs not even hard dude lol QQ
---
thank you for informing me i shall delete this now 
---
My clan does it with 5 all the time, just cause, we always cheese morgeth and riven and boop the eyes into the main room on vault
---
lol yep! I was as surprised as you are but it really does. It's great if you have pants with Dynamo, you can keep refilling your dodge and farm super (:
---
Shimmering emerald? Wait what?? Is that a locked shader I can't see?üò≥
---
People can‚Äôt hack on Xbox One lol, morons. 
---
The  modding community is pretty dead when it comes to consoles. 
---
Sweet. Thanks man. My mates and I have done the base game raids with 5 of us and was looking to finally get around to doing this one as well.
---
Does there need to be a lot of adjustments for the lack of a 6th or is it fairly straight forward? 
---
Can be 3 manned. Check out Gladd and company
---
Dude that's insane haha. Also a german interface, we should play sometime if you run out of glimmer again :P (assuming you're living in Germany or nearby countries with identical time zone)
---
I have seen random vids from time to time from Gladd. But i know he and his clan mates are far better players than my mates and I haha. But I shall investigate. Thanks. 
---
Not to hard, kali and suro chi are prtty much the same, but with morgeth we throw down a well behind him and use a tractor and ep shottys, then on tiven we all go to crystal room and use a well with tractor and bad omens cluster to cheese her
---
Nah, I mostly meant the one black armory shader that's super green but has the same animated effect.
---
Awesome. That doesn't seem to bad. I look forward to giving it a go. Thanks! 
---
For single boss damage, sure, but for literally anything else it's very underwhelming. It's an exotic that shines for a split second when you pop your super and then goes back to being worthless.
---
I thought it was inspired by the ''Platoon'' movie guy. ü§î I don't know if it's spoiler now but ...

The squad leader that didn't make it to the chopper, and ran in the jungle, followed by Vietnamese fighters, he end up dying on his knees, and if you look at the OST cover, you can see this guy.

Yeah it should be great in Gambit

Foresaken is required, no nerfs planned as far as I know
---
Wait now hold on, I dont even think i have a hundred and I've had the game for a year now
---
Yet somehow we went from the amazing ornament gear to the oh so lovely polished trash can armor in vanilla D2
---
Powerful at the time
---
Cant remember where i got my first one from but got my second one from a crucible game
---
fun and gambit don¬¥t fit together
---
Lol it's good armor stats wiseas well
---
Yellows are Exotics. Often the best weapons in the game...and most rare. 
---
As far as legendary purples...a lot of it depends upon your playstyle and what game modes you are playing in. Personally, I like the trust, tigerspite, blast furnace, hazard of the cast, bad omens,  ikeleos shotgun from escalation protocol and so on.  A lot of it comes down to the perks on them. Outlaw/Rampage typically being a good one to look out for. Others are good depending upon the gun.
---
There is really so much though, a lot being based on your play style and what you play. Googling the various weapons you get in the perks can  help you understand if it's something that you should keep and try or dismantle. You can safely dismantle all blues at this point.
---
It was my first one.
---
This makes me very happy. As a newbie to this game I hope someone takes me under their wing
---
The real dealbreaker is how they nerfed box breathing

God roll is opinionated all that matters is you like your rool

I don't think it's ever actually been revealed what race Shaxx is. I was always under the impression that he was a regular dude though since his voice sounds pretty normal.

Is the shader even 100%??

Yep let's hope that happens.

They really only need to handle the gear side so its not as much as youd think. The rest is P2P really.

I think the other missions come up as the week changes and the curse gets stronger, but I could be wrong. 
---
The tincture allows you to become ascendant and see hidden chests and the portal into the ascendant realm for the challenge. 
---
The ascendant challenge this week is in the lost sector in Rheasilvia, the sector is under the waterfall. 
---
Blind Well is for you to get some good gear, finish some triumphs, and for the bounty Petra gives you so you can get an offering to the Oracle. 
---
The problems you are having on right in shadow are pretty common. 
---
For shooting ground psions, most groups cross shoot. Middle is always responsible for middle psion, left person always shoots right and right person always shoots left. This ensures you always have line of sight. 
---
That last wall is also a pain until you get used to it on right. Crouching definitely helps but, if you pay attention, you can actually see the problem spot. It‚Äôs one panel that is slanted and higher up on one side. The person on right should slide more in toward the middle person almost standing right next to eachother before heading up to the final wall. 
---
At the very front, once you are on that last wall, everyone can just shoot the psions in front of them. 
---
Would legitimately love an actual horde mode. Please don‚Äôt make another prison of elders.

I love running out and grabbing one mote just to run back and bank it.

This isn't an LFG sub.

Rule 13.
---
/r/Fireteams 
---
\&gt; 0 is directly a positive number, but if you look at kills as a gain for your team and deaths as a loss than 1.0 is the point at which you begin to work toward a positive effect for your team.
---
Realistically, due to efficiency including assists and there being game modes other than clash, it's not necessarily true that a kill or assist is always equal and opposite to deaths.
---
Might give it a go got it as a drop the other week.
---
I know. And I haven't fucking found it. I'm almost 650 too. So I must be doing something wrong
---
Plus, according to the Dreaming City lore, the reason there's so much crystal is that the reflections in the crystal shows reality when the ahamkara are distorting it to deceive. OP says this is in the crystal room below Riven, so if Savathun is watching and manipulating Riven we could be seeing her reflection in the crystal.

Thank you kind stranger, this was very helpful :)

Youd think id used a racial slur.  At least im not an asshole.  This sub is clearly filled with them.

One of my last IB matches before reset and we had a level 8 Titan on our team.  We won, but I have no idea how that guy managed to do anything other than instantly die.  
---
made a titan a few days ago to enjoy the exotic. it dropped on my first strike at lvl30. 
---
I hate playing solo. I could play all day with my crew but yea I‚Äôll do the minimum matches solo and then be done.
---
Yeah good point, I really wish Bungie would buff SMGs, I love using them but they're just not in a very good place atm
---
yeah i guess so, I just remembered that 2 dropped on my titan a few days ago too
---
how does the key work tho once you get it, does it open only one chest???? or can u use it multiple times??????
---
Alright, checkmate you got me. Sorry if I offended you
---
Pretty much, it is a little absurd if you ask me. It would be easy to add it to the loot pool of other catalysts in strikes or crucible or w/e but Bungie is too lazy to even do that.
---
Run! 
---
Nice RNG luck ! I'm on 30 odd tries and still no thousand voices 
---
Add juanbrizuela to your friends list. I got you babe.
---
primes are definitely massively limited after you get 1 in a day.
---
Still better than those guys grinding breakneck matches who would collect 15 and just die. Had two teammates who never banked a single mote between the two of them, and killed maybe 10 enemies. Reported the fuck out of them. 
---
I recently set my team and local chats to always on and I see a lot of chatter now. Mostly toxic but it's something...
---
I actually did not know this 
---
Now I gotta go
---
Just found out I need to kill some things..... a lot
---
And turning in 15 for any quest or bounty that takes turning in motes won‚Äôt count any except the ones the bank allowed I feel
---
It‚Äôs probably just that one cloak, I had a glitched helmet that did that as well as eating anything I infused into it without increasing in level.

Best bet would be to get rid of it once you get a higher level cloak

I got the collection on PS4 and just finished The Taken King expansion.  Strikes are way more difficult than in 2, and finding people can be a little hard.  It does seem that I've hit a LL wall before I can get into Rise of Iron, but honestly I haven't really looked around to see where to gear up yet.  I haven't PvP'd yet, mostly because I suck with a controller. 
---
IB is a good check for aggressive players if your under level. When I got back on after a few months out it helped me to regain my map awareness and cover strategies, and helped me get back to top of the scoreboard in quickplay
---
Images you can hear
---
It's like Mayhem in PvP, but for PvE instead.
---
I‚Äôm confused as to what you‚Äôre complaining about. 
---
We need more people like you in this world.
---
Didn't actually know what a decrypted key was until last week and I'm power level 600 so you're not the worst one out there.
---
Wow amazing, those pictures are gonna be a great help. Thank you so much!
---
Every set here looks more like armour than the stuff he wear about now in D2
---
Dude, I have a 523 power Thunderlord from my previous Titan. I've been playing for a while. I'm just replaying the campaigns for exotics.
---
We can agree that Forsaken is a very good game, but anything before that have been a joke.
---
90% of my experience in this game and the reason why I have thousands of hours between D1-&amp; 2 is the comradely. However, it‚Äôs usually with strikes and raids. I‚Äôve got friends in real life from this game. Great story keep helping others.
---
Fantastic drawing! To make it pop more, shade on the web part of the mouth near the top of the mouth. It'll add more depth. 
---
Great either way!
---
I'm a member of the warlock master race so I understand
---
My friend got an exotic, legendary, and rare from one enemy
---
If matchmaking doesn‚Äôt exist, then how do you get into a game?
---
Dalia 99-40 was a Redjack for Lord Shaxx that was equal to Arcite 99-40 in capability and the 2 worked together a lot.
---
I h a v e d o n e t h I s r a I d 1 1 t I m e s
---
Personally, I have such a hard time with just winning Gambit (getting matched against 4 stacks, missing my QB shots, teammates that sideswipe then die to Invaders or worse, get killed by mobs), I've never focused on bounties other than the weekly, all the dailies are just a nice bonus if I end up completing them. I don't even have breakneck yet cause I just find playing that much Gambit for just one gun would sap my will to play.
---
How do you work around Telesto?
---
Horde mode would be useless after a certain point, you could just chain supers and never have any issues. Ursa, pheonix, shards, orphius.
---
It‚Äôs just another symbol. Not all of the secrets are/can be solved yet. 
---
I don‚Äôt either, what exactly do they need to do to implement this system more quickly?
---
Why do people bunch up! 
---
I scatter more like a cockroach. If I have no motes I try to bait the invader into fucusing on me. If I can waste a shot or two of his or a few seconds time, it might keep him from getting to those two dudes holding 15 motes each. 
---
hey man i really enjoyed this post ! any chance you have the whole version? me and my clan are dying at this and how perfect it synced up with the song!
---
It‚Äôs probably not as easy to go through but I know on the standard destiny companion app you can go through collections and click each perk on a gun and see what possible perks could be there instead. 
---
Keep going! these are great!
---
Looks like the Bungie dev who implemented One Eyed Mask
---
Follow your teammates and steal their kills if you have to. 
---
Both this one and the rare I had in the inventory showed up this way.
---
Same with scout rifles in my opinion. Anything I would use a scout rifle for I would rather have either a hand cannon or a sniper. I get that they're the middle ground and they do well in certain pve stages but they are USELESS in PvP
---
Can‚Äôt transfer if your character isn‚Äôt high enough. 
---
I thought it was benedict in the poster for prenumbra?
---
FFFFFFFFF
---
Mm nice 
---
This D1 armour got me fucked up
---
I only notice if I have any monitor below 60hz hooked up, in addition to other monitors that are 60hz or higher. Try only using one 60hz or better monitor to see if it makes a difference first. Otherwise it could be an HDD, PSU, RAM, or Heat related issue. I'm not sure what else it could be without knowing more. 
---
All i want is my dab emote back. I switched to pc and you cant get it anymore :(
---
youre now a pusher ,luke on any corner.!!!!first one was free,right? Lol.
---
nice going!!!! i remeber my first.
---
Normally [this site](https://wherethefuckisxur.com/) will tell you, but seeing as Xur has been here for 6 minutes I am guessing that's why it hasn't updated yet. 
---
Probably the most infuriating part of gambit
---
I almost have the Breakneck and the Malfeasance so I‚Äôm almost burned out on it but I still love playing. If you ever want to play on Xbox, you can add me and I‚Äôll try to help. 
---
6 minutes is slow imo, who has time for this jank
---
No problem. It‚Äôs one of my favorite parts of the game, I enjoy it a lot :)
---
Wavesplitter gang, sorry, congrats on both.
---
howdy,I'm older,too. im ACTUALLY 55. and a girl. I would soooooo,love to hook up with someone who knows what's it's like to have arthritis.... ha ha ha .please,pm me. I'm PS4... you?
---
Yeah wasn't that a wishing well
---
Real Monsters
---
Oh well damn. And ya it‚Äôs not fun. It took like a 13 hour grind to get malfeasance. 
---
Guys how could he *possibly* have time to level a hunter when his full time job is *punching the enemies of humanity into a fine paste.*
---
Oh yeah, good point, I guess it's not usually the case that you're counting on that guy to bank. My bad, this definitely fits
---
Stuck on the corrupted strike, building up the will to solo it.
---
i searched awhile till I found a clan that fits me. my clan reaches 7raids a week. and raids 3times that.
---
   then,you still need to put yourself out there,within your clan. it's very hard, cause I don't for in a lot,but.... maybe try other clans,or get on your chat and bug till they help....Lol
---
The in-game chat is usually laden with toxicity. This was refreshingly wholesome. 
---
Champion of the void, you have my respect.
---
What‚Äôs the role on the dunemarchers please?
---
I had two friends carry my worthless ass through it. 
---
Sometimes there‚Äôs nothing you can do to avoid it but you can shoot the crystals to clear them out and just watch walls and floors because that‚Äôs where a lot of people tend to shoot 
---
You should be
---
Neat! I have never done a raid before. Pls help.
---
Enjoy the sword man, the heavy swing launches that projectile super far, it‚Äôs a great time!
---
Neat! I have never done a raid before... Pls help.
---
Neat! I've never completed a raid before... Pls help.
---
Where is xur this week?&gt; 
---
Earth
---
Fun fact, if you only need 3 to summon and you put in 15, you won't summon a large blacker. It only counts the motes that contribute to the actual score, not what you had. 
---
Nighthawk roll?
---
Makes me wish I would be present in a match where the barriers glitch and the teams can shoot each other, I‚Äôd love to see what happens if you try it against him. 
---
Bungo I'm proud of you!
---
And then geta killed by the Queensbreaker/Thunderlord invader and lose #Always 
---
I got Fighting Lion and 1K Voices in a single chest last night, RNGesus has gave me godhood
---
All have the same chance. I had smg and shotgun on same drop.
---
Perpetuation and Primary ammo finder
---
I wondered if it did or not. Last night we were collecting and we killed a HVT right towards the time to summon, and I grabbed 15 motes and after teammates banked we had 74. I put in my 15 and it said a ogre was sent over. 
---
pulse rifle targeting and special ammo finder
---
Imma finna cry this is wholesome
---
I hate you lol
---
Much harder to pull off but yeah, that's a tough thing to counter. Though truthfully someone on your team should be invading them if they are saving up that much
---
Grenade launcher ammo.
---
Ya and so did a lot of others, but if you look closely there's differences that suggest this is another redjack probably Dalia, as Benedict has been visibly hacked and those markings aren't on this bot.
---
Thanks buddy 
---
heeeee. why don't you guys bloody stand still for a damn second!!!????
---
  I've been in crucible,with 4of you at one time. I swear my neck broke just trying to see where you were!!!!
---
Lol
---
I'm not really familiar with the devs since I haven't played long but it seems like a pretty basic thing to get done, so I have no clue. 
---
you‚Äôre welcome
---
Thanks!
---
haaaaaaaaa,
---
Exactly, not sure if it was obviously because you arnt in both teams. But i do think it sends the blocker, but doesnt add to your mote totals
---
I‚Äôll take his whole stock. 
---
If they did probably no one would use it cause that's the case on pc
---
It‚Äôs a really difficult knight to kill. 
---
I miss those moments
---
@OP did you get this drop from the powerful bounty for spider? Bc i got the exact same drop from it and one of the legendaries was a ship
---
[same](https://imgur.com/gallery/5QBq0Mg)
---
Yeah, but I even wonder if the report function does something.
---
It feels like an button not connected to anything... 
---
Is that the spider bounty?
---
I'm famous amongst my friends for using it in PvP. Before Forsaken, it was an absolute machine, requires a particular playstyle but once you mastered it, it was fantastic.
---
Thanks boss
---
No, but it would be a better place if you took your meaningless whinging elsewhere.
---
Probably gets wrecked by it too
---
Whats wrong with the mods and the subreddit? 
---
Especially seeing as Asher used modified Vex technology to do it.
---
I think it's 3 competitive games during the week to get them 
---
i don't get it.
---
Is there any info on this? I'm curious what the nerf will be. 
---
I wont use one eyed mask for this purpose.  Why does it have to be so ugly ?
---
I'm pretty straightforward on strikes.
---
I don't care if you suck, I will revive you.
---
I don't care if you don't know the tactics, I will show you.
---
I don't care if you're undergeared, I will pull the extra weight for you.
---
But so help me god, if you go AFK, I will do everything within my (admittedly limited) power to fuck you over.
---
Yeah I main crucible. Pve doesn‚Äôt hit the spot with me anymore. Plus I usually play solo as my online buddies don‚Äôt play destiny anymore so I just play casual
---
I've decided that I'm just never going to get these guns and until they add something else to the game that can rival it I'll just stick to my weekly milestones and go back to the forges. 
---
Aw.. Want some buddies to play with? I have a large recruiting clan
---
No, not all the time because on kills it drops normal ammo I think
---
Damn that would have been an epic lore card 
---
I still think, given his history, people make too much of the fact that he wants to stay off the vanguard's radar and find a counter to the light.
---
He was around when the Warlords used the light to rule over the rest of humanity. It makes sense he might try to find a way to counter light-bearers similar to Thorn.
---
That would be fantastic
---
I still turn my tokens in, as I still don't have my perfect Fate Cries Fowl. Literally the one thing I want from the current pool, although a kill clip, full auto, ricochet rounds Anonymous Autumn sounds pretty nice as well.
---
I remember doing the first strike in D1 and thought it was super hard. O what a fledgling I was in those days
---
Sure, its a good clue for me too. Always :-D
---
I have a clan that will gladly raid with you, pm me if you're interested. :)
---
Yeah idk the first thing about programming games or being a dev so I can‚Äôt comment on how easy it should be.
---
I saw one person flirting with another on local chat at the Farm.
---
It was awkward and cringey, so I gtfo instead of engaging them
---
I 100% agree.
---
Unfortunately, I don't know how to report inactive and do-nothing mods to Reddit. There is only 1 that I even see comment in this sub anymore and I have reported countless posts that break rules and they doen't get removed or it takes days to remove.
---
That is why this sub has devolved into a MEME wasteland. I really wish the mods would give a frick about the sub.
---
Instead I find myself just coming here less and less.
---
They‚Äôre in the fucking trees
---
4,841 hours for me logged into playing D1. Although I already have 2,960 hours in D2 and play it every day, I still like to go back to D1 and play every now and then. I hope Bungie never takes the servers offline because D1 is truly a masterpiece. 
---
To me personally, I think that D1 not only was more fun, both to play and experience, but that it is truly more beautiful than D2. There is just something about how D2 looks that just hasn't set right for me since day one. I don't know how to describe it. Maybe more cartoony? The colors just aren't as vibrant, sharp or realistic. Oh well. Like I said, I don't know how to describe it. Lol. Maybe, then again, I just can't see as good as I could back in 2014 when D1 launched. üòï
---
It‚Äôs not a wishing well.  You don‚Äôt make wishes on it.  You charge it like a battery.  
---
You can join mine! We have like 3 members and all play whenever it's convenient.
---
I also play mostly solo and haven't touched a raid yet! 580 hunter
---
Lol yeah, first time i made it through i was so mad i didnt know about the key. ..but as stated its only for armor. Weapons drop without it
---
And a ton of shaders
---
Just a heads up, not everyone likes shitposts and worthless memes flooding the front pages. Just because someone is expressing a dislike for how the sub is run doesn't mean you need to be an ass. If you want to defend this MEME wasteland of a sub, then you are part of the problem.
---
Ladies and Gentlemen... we got em
---
Should be at shaxx I suppose 
---
Mods are inactive? don't do anything? I can only name 1 that I have even seen interact with the sub. 
---
The sub is littered with useless content and bad posts. This is all just going unchecked because the mods don't care.
---
THAT's whats wrong with the sub.
---
Man I remember when I could game all winter break, oh to be young
---
The car behind Dennis is the invader with Queen breaker
---
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
Or just read the plain white text in the middle of the screen.
---
So you don't play hunter due to the one ugly ass cloak there is in the endgame? 
---
I'll look try to finagle around his inventory again to see if it's off screen or something but I couldn't find it earlier 
---
&gt; Like there's a VERY OBVIOUS audio cue if you're listening to in-game sound.
---
Can you even describe it as an "audio cue" if you're literally being TOLD "BANK THOSE MOTES"? 
---
I'd say the "cue" is visual, and it's when your pale bar fills.
---
Use the tether, then all hits is precision. That way you'll get 1 or 2 precision kills per game 
---
More guardian kills needed.
---
Not bad at all rip no sealed ahamkara grasps but good inventory for today.
---
The only thing bungie has said is that it is getting nerfed. We don‚Äôt know how and what.
---
If you have another character it‚Äôs probably still on them.
---
Right. And I don't count things *brought back* as "new". 
---
If I'm on top of my team that's how I know my team is fucking shit
---
Only have the one on pc as I'm slowly catching up from xb but I may have to start a 2nd just to do it now 
---
Good point, i guess that could work though as just a way to get better using your abilities to the beat you can
---
Helping new guardians become my new favourite thing to do in this game
---
Every fucking time!
---
If I don't have motes I actively look for the invader. I'm fine with dying to him if I can at least take off his overshield, make it easier for the team, especially if I can keep him distracted long enough. Unfortunately I normally die alone with my teammates seemingly clueless that someone even invaded at those times.
---
The odds!!
---
Bring a sword!
---
hey bro i‚Äôm building a PC this weekend (moving from xbox to pc, kinda scary) and am looking for people to be friends with and that can help me a bit. I‚Äôm like 610 on xbox, so I know the basics. I can message you my blizzard gamer tag if you want
---
I did this with the first forge weapon we got, the Hammerhead, I don't know if it was a god roll or not, I do know it was my highest power level weapon at the time, but I wanted the shader. It had to be sacrificed.
---
Thats hive my friend
---
Thanks man. 
---
how the hell are ya console players supposed to type in chat, literally just message the guy directly 
---
He has two pages, like many NPC vendors. 
---
If there was like a mechanic similar to what those guys in the scourge raid have, things would be different I think. You have to balance it for sure.
---
cried in xbox
---
Ps4 supports keyboards,  and backing out constantly sucks. Or you can use your ohone tobtype if no keyboard. Either way ut purs the chat on screen for all to see. 3 people in a strike chatting thru ps4 chat sux donkey balls
---
This is great.  
---
How do you get it?
---
You mean their own... Destiny... I'll see myself out
---
&gt;This is all just going unchecked because the mods don't care.
---
Wrong. Here's why... 
---
I'm one of maybe TWO active mods here. And guess what? I DO have a life outside of this sub. I cannot be here 24 hours a day, despite my wish to. 
---
You ever tried to plug a hole in a dam with just one finger? 
---
If you're so unhappy here, go back to /r/DestinyTheGame. Or did they ban you again? 
---
I definitely agree, even Mananan feels terrible.
---
It's not on the main where you get bounties or on page 2 where the tokens are,  I assume it's just lost or a glitch but I'm going to check again here shortly since any relevant info I find is for abandoned exotic quests and they can be retrieved. I can always start a 2nd character but I was trying to avoid that for the time being. 
---
master rahool wants to
---
 *know your location*
---
yeah i‚Äôm super excited to get home and get grav lance, but more excited for nighthawk
---
Please tell me English isn‚Äôt your primary language
---
This was always one of my biggest complaints about the side stories in this game. I can kinda see why Ikora might be so negative, but she's still objectively wrong. Consider this: The Traveler may be an alien god, but it is also clearly a machine. These aren't mutually exclusive. And as we've seen, "magic" of any sort, the Traveler's or otherwise, is just sufficiently advanced technology exploiting higher-dimensional physics. Then there's Ghosts - mobile AIs that have a wireless link to the Traveler's power and can confer Light on individual people. That sounds like a "Blessing created by technology" to me. Now we know that the Traveler's  raw energy is *not* Light, but the Traveler can generate  and emit Light. Therefore, the Traveler must have an internal mechanism that converts the raw energy output of its main power plant into Light. So, in essence, what Asher has done is simply created an extremely primitive replica of that system using scavenged and modified Vex technology. That alone is probably one of the most momentous scientific discoveries in human history. Much as he's annoying as a person, he deserves whatever the City Age equivalent of a Nobel Prize is.
---
I removed anything previous week related to frames and this still happened to me. Something else has to be going on here.
---
You got me there 
---
Vex, ever since the Cyclops started shooting again, it's like they are doing extra to make up for that lost time being unable to throw balls of death at me from across the map
---
You can attack alone when you are powerful enough. But there is no need to unless you have a quest.
---
Sure if you can pull off 4 ogres that‚Äôs great but odds are at least one of those guys are going to die before that. With a good invasion you could drop them 60 motes and basically have a free round win right there. 
---
If I have excess shards, I should just buy stuff for other classes? Even though I havent really played them?
---
You can open the crates without killing the forge saboteur, just destroy the drone generating the shield around the crate, finish the quest step and run.
---
Is this the one that comes from the Whisper mission? I completely forgot that I was doing that lol
---
if you plan on leveling them yeah, especially if you have extra shards
---
Satou shader? Love it. At least i don't have such a good roll as yours.
---
Maybe it's a heroic mission? Idk I'm not extremely active
---
Number one rule, if the last game was balanced abandon the que and re-hard que, you'll be screwed if you didn't
---
Progenitus is a nasty card when combined with artifacts that let you put creatures in play when you tap them.
---
No red after I touched it it became green we found 2 
---
I'm on PS4 also and haven't done any of the raids yet. I'm LL 631 and live trying to hunt down all the weapons and lore through the game. I'm actually playing a second character with my son since I bought him a PS4 and destiny for Christmas. My buddy started a clan which is only 2 of us so far. If you need a clan or ever just want to play some stuff together I'm down. I also haven't done any nightfalls yet because lack of friends playing destiny. Hit me up if you want DazeOfWar on PSN
---
You have to beat the whisper of the worm heroic dungeon after opening all 6 hidden chests, then beat it once for the next 3 weeks
---
I'll take another look. I've taken out the shield generators around the crate and they appear empty. I figured they were black forge from the logo.
---
I got it a little bit more than average yday
---
Good man
---
By getting the oracles in the whisper mission, that'll drop the blueprint. Then you have to beat the mission with every singe.
---
Last I checked yes!
---
Will do babe üëçüèª
---
Is that considered a god roll? Having trouble wrapping my brain around why it would be. 
---
I can't remember which one it is. It's a nice silver and matte blue
---
Lol this is the softest sub on reddit
---
Unless you have the quest for a weapon frame they wont have anything inside.
---
The crates give you nothing unless you have a quest step that requires opening one. 
---
F
---
Yep that's it.
---
Hoping to,Depends on free time and stuff
---
LFG mebbe or Destiny 2 app
---
Well, they do have a chance on dropping prototype weapons, which can be nice. 
---
They're all hive to me...
---
Opening shot is very strong at the moment, explosive rounds are awesome to throw off the aim of the not forgotten monsters and range speaks for itself. 
---
I swear this game needs a damn manual!
---
Thanks.
---
This was me yesterday night. Haven't played D2 since lanch and I was gifted an expansion pack for my birthday. Playing yesterday felt like learning to walk again. I felt sorry for my team mates. I'm on ps4 - psn: TygerBlack_ if anyone wants to play? 
---
Baki was a pretty fun anime to watch. Pretty silly at times but still fun. Can‚Äôt wait till the next season comes out. 
---
Top tier but not a God roll I guess
---
That is awesome 
---
no firefly no godroll
---
If your on PlayStation I can help you out man
---
Why? What do you consider a godroll? 
---
You forgot to add in mask of the quiet one.
---
25 gunsmith mats, 3 legendary shards = 1 mod component at Ada-1
---
I've finished Forsaken and am light level 600 - what should I be doing to get to 650? I'm not high enough for the forges, nightfalls or raids yet. 
---
Do you own the annual pass?
---
Lmao this dude spazzing hardcore because glitches exist im dead
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
POE SHALL RETURN!
---
Usually it's outlaw w/ rampage or kill clip, or rangefinder and rampage for 110s but sidearms with tap the trigger and full auto are basically lasers, explosive rounds is eh imo
---
Sure my man
---
Damn that looks like a good pair of horns. Would be a shame if someone..... m a d e I T I n t o a h e l m e t.
---
Just got done reading in another thread that Crimson has one of the lowest TTK in PVP in the game
---
Breakneck, IKELOS Shotgun, and a Hammerhead. I don't even use an exotic weapon anymore.
---
I believe the door into the black armory costs $30 to open.
---
apparently I don't remember the little destiny lore I've read well at all lol. Also feel free to stop downvoting me
---
I'm on xbox and could def use some help. 
---
The bow is ALWAYS curated.
---
But they are exotic versions so they are completely new to the game 
---
Nope. Guessing that‚Äôs important?
---
In an luna / not forgotten environment rampage and killclip are doing nothing for you if you cant even win the first firefight. Im pretty happy with this roll and contest against the lunas and forgottens pretty good. 
---
Black armoury and the next 2 dlc‚Äôs are annual pass content so you need that and forsaken to play
---
That‚Äôs a very nice PVE cannon 
---
Close, accurised and rasmussen, but a range masterwork. MAX RANGE LAZER SNIPES
---
It‚Äôs s good pvp roll. Opening shot and explosive payload are really good pvp rolls. If it was pve then a god roll would be outlaw and firefly. 
---
Are they the Abyssal Champions? I have a queens bounty to kill 4. Gonna a fight in that challenge. 
---
Do you guys even played pvp lately? :D
---
I like how he freaks out that we have access to Rasputin.  
---
Alright thank you. All I need is $10-$15
---
Yea
---
You have to do the oracles and then complete whisper on the arc, solar, and void modifiers
---
No. Conversely, the Linear Fusion rifle perk doesn't work for Fusion rifles. 
---
NP
---
If you're on Mars, I believe that's the aftermath of an escalation protocol
---
Pretty sure they have their own specific perks, you can check easily by just rallying at a flag with and without though. 
---
I read all that...
---
He doesn't spawn
---
What mod verbally assaulted you? 
---
&gt;1: are the forges and future content that will launch with season pass be permanent or will the forges only stay for season 5 ?
---
So far, the only activities that have been removed were because of bad player feedback (they will be back "soon," after bungie figures out how to fix them). Absolutely nothing else disappears. New content is simply added on top of  the old. 
---
&gt;2: bungie gave out a roadmap that states upcoming events upto august 2019...after that will there be another season pass or will the current season pass do for future D2 content ?
---
We do not know what's happening after this current season pass. I suspect it'll be one larger DLC, similar to how Forsaken came out in September after two smaller DLCs. 
---
Am I the only one who's eyes got fooled by this picture? I really thought this was photoshopped  kinda good for the first 10 secs until I realized that it's just a simply pasted, cropped picture.
---
I checked about 10 times :D
---
Huge 
---
It is
---
You're a madman.. 
---
1. Permanent
---
2. Good question, probably just need the one annual pass but $35 for the content it gives üíØ worth anyways.

Using the destiny app, the100.io, and r/destinysherpa can get you some experience. The encounters are fun but their more akin to old school WoW experiences than the tank and spank stuff I was used to. 
---
Whenever my travels around the universe bring me to the EDZ, I always tend to find myself unable to go back to orbit until the lower level kinderguardians running have gotten some help from me to move on to the next zone. 
---
Oh well, it's time well spent. 
---
Why thank you
---
Yeah, I definitely agree there. I know some people are fans of the fresh start and I see the benefits for getting new players introduced. But yeah, we need SOMETHING from our hundreds of hours invested to carry over, not just our ugly-ass D1 guardians XD 
---
That's the main reason you join an online game - to progress over the years!
---
My buddy absolutely never hears it and he doesn‚Äôt play music or anything. 
---
Me: ‚Äúwhat the fuck are you doing? Bank for primeval?‚Äù
---
Him: ‚Äúdo we have enough?‚Äù
---
Me: ‚Äúhe literally just yelled it at you....‚Äù

Ravangers

This week its the EP boss who has minions that drop orbs when killed. So alot of supers can be used. 
---
I unlocked it with travelling to Dreaming City, you can Google guide for it. Althought becouse I do not have eny annual pass etc, there is nothing for me, I get to talk to Ada but thats it. 
---
Hmmm, maybe you should have mentioned you were going for God Roll in PvP in your post instead of posting a low effort post. Maybe people wouldn't have misunderstood the intention of your post if you were clear. 
---
It's good or bad for me. Either I'm on top and we win or I'm near the bottom and we win OR we lose and I'm on either end for my team. 
---
Mine takes normal ammo and i can just spam it. 
---
On PS4 as well, add tracey97 if you want. I play a lot of solo as well. Hunter is roughly 620, working on warlock, little over 600. Husband is also on, but doesn't play as often - badboys1812 - so I'm leveling his Hunter as well lol. I need help with the Forge and Corrupted; my son will sometimes play his character and help üôÇ.
---
These are awesome! Can you do some fallen pls?
---
Sounds like a bug, could always send a bug report to bungo sometimes they are helpful :c
---
Ill try disabling the left trigger and see how that works? 
---
I think I have the arc. Guess I could finish it to get it out of the way. Plus it will masterwork it finally
---
Yeah you right. I just thought it was clear. Dont know why you would waste your energy slot for something like a trust. I know better next time. Thanks :) 
---
Just fast travel over and over until you find a group. No need to return to orbit and back.
---
I've been helping a friend get his luna. last night we got paired with a 3 stack, had a lvl 7 on our team and one person quit during load (guessing because 3 stack)
---
We put up a fight with 2.5 guardians and one was even tbagging. We would have won if our 4th didnt quit before the match even started. 
---
Bungie should not make new people go into comp and there should be something implemented to help when someone quits because it doesnt autofill a person.
---
A good enough player can work around OEM as well.
---
Has a bounty to summon a large blocker. The bounties are what ruin the game mode
---
More like when your lagging so hard that neither of these matter . 
---
The game has MILLIONS of players dude. Not everyone plays like you. Some people like the gun. You should understand that with millions of players, not everyone is thinking the same way.
---
What's the magazine and barrel perk?
---
Thanks 
---
I'll look again when I get home to make sure I'm not missing anything and if not I'll definitely look into sending a report. Thanks for that tip, didn't even think about a bug report. 
---
I know you guys probably hear more complaints than compliments, so I want to reassure you that you're doing fine. This guy is just confrontational and I wouldn't take his comments too seriously.
---
Thank you especially for all of your hard work, love this sub and will keep coming back.
---
Extended barrel and accurised rounds. 
---
We are venom?
---
:'(
---
I knew I recognized the rant almost immediately, but then it took me until the "When I was insolent" part to remember.
---
Im one of the mentioned millions. And i think its a god roll :) 
---
Explosive Payload ruins any chance at a god roll. Sorry. 
---
Yep, the descriptions of each forge clearly outline which frame can be forged there.
---
Oooooooo. Maybe it's part of a Challenge this week or something? It makes me think there are upwards of 8 buttons... similar to the Sparrow Racing.
---
Lmao honestly, at this point just be happy they changed the hand cannon invader kills in gambit.
---
Also if you have it, Crimson might help you get those crucible headshots.
---
Im actually not confrontational!  Thats the point im making.  Ive seen to many instances where mods on this sub just go for the juggular with insults, rude comnents and such and start needless confrontations rather than setting an example by having a discussion.  
---
Happy now just what?
---
You got a source on that? I had no idea 
---
There are only 3 story missions.  But 6 different ascendant challenges.  That may be what you're thinking of, btw.
---
he is wrong. that's the base roll. xur's roll is sniper/machinegun reserves + hc/fusion targeting/hands-on
---
That and if your team is constantly putting out phalanxes quickly they‚Äôre not gonna be able to bank those motes at all. 
---
This is the easy version. 
---
Lol yeah, took me 2 games to get that step done with Crimson
---
This is cool
---
To counter the snipers, we have 2 on adjacent roof tops eliminating snipers. Then they assist with the ground orb runners in any marauders that need to be taken out then post back on the roof to ensure back or whatever shields they see are cleared. 
---
Also, I think SOTP is really fun! The sparrow race cracks me up every time! 
---
whats DIM?
---
Yeah if you havnt masterworked your whisper yet you are missing out big time man
---
I literally haven't gotten a single one yet. And I have a full set of Gambit Armor, Malfeasance, Bad Omens with Cluster Bomb and Bygones with Kill Clip Outlaw. Feels bad.
---
cant forget gladiators
---
On the wiki it lists six under ‚ÄúStory Missions‚Äù:
---
Awakening
---
Corsair Down
---
Vengeance
---
Broken Courier
---
The Oracle Engine
---
Dark Monastery
---
One of the big criticisms of Destiny 2 on release was that there wasn't anything for players who *wanted* to try really hard and put in a lot of effort. People said the game was too casual. So they added quests like Ace of Spades that are actually difficult. 
---
"A red sun rises. Blood has been spilled this night"
---
So i am still pretty new to Destiny 2. Just opened Dreaming city and sitting at 561, running hunter. Should I pick up Celestial and Graviton?
---
xur is on top of a hill at Winding cove this weekend
---
Stuff sold:
---
Beloved Celestial Nighthawk 
---
Graviton Lance 
---
Dunemarchers
---
Sanguine Alchemy
---
Clearly we are the minority on this sub. I guess this content is what people want to see here!
---
Probably the funnest raid in all of Destiny tbh
---
God Roll for PvP maybe. If it doesn't have super fast reload and damage increases for PvE though, it's no godroll for PvE. 
---
Too bad there isn't a gun that can get both Explosive/Timed and High Cal at the same time. Curses. 
---
I play an Orpheus nightstalker, so the fact that hive always rush you makes it really easy to abuse entire waves with a single tether.
---
Underrated post
---
Thank you, definitely gonna get the titan
---
Finally finishing the masterwork today--veeeeery excited to try it out üî´üòéüëç
---
On the bright side, if we do get another heavily vex themed expansion we will likely get a good bit of Osiris
---
Thanks, I'll try it out! 
---
I'd be down to join you guys. I'm on ps4 as well
---
Fair enough, didnt mean to be annoying or anything i was just wondering cause im never usually lucky on either destiny, but thanks
---
Had a friemd.semd me the link to this comment just to upvote.
---
Coming from a non-crucible player, it took me 20 games of iron banner not trying at all with my nation of beasts. Honestly if you don‚Äôt like crucible or can‚Äôt stand crucible (I strictly only play and love I.B.) you‚Äôre almost at a loss. 
---
Lol yeah I dont have a source but when my friends told me that I started listening to the drifter whenever I banked the final amount. He will announce what blocker you sent along with the normal summoning dialogue 
---
I'm at 15, and so afraid that I'll get to 30 times without 1k üò≠
---
Add me on PSN, YungTubbyfr35h
---
Dragon/Firefly, essentially the same thing but you get what I meant. 
---
So what you‚Äôre saying is when we go to bank we should get an option screen like at an ATM.
---
Would you like 1 large, 1 medium 1 small or 3 small blockers?
---
üòÇ üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
In my honest opinion, not playing Destiny at all might be better than vanilla Destiny 2. Though I'm not sure how exactly you've screwed yourself. Forsaken is great, but if you can't afford it right now don't buy it. If you have PS+ you have the option to play a lot of 'free' games. 
---
There's no real harm in playing vanilla if you already have it, but it's not going to make you fall in love with Destiny and it won't give you any idea how good Forsaken is. 
---
You would think so, but the whole "strafing" thing was brand new to me when I started, as well as the different kind of map awareness needed. 
---
Have they ever given out any reasons for pulling weird stunts like this?
---
Just steal one...
---
Someday maybe I'll get in on that raid! YouTube videos make it look awesome! 
---
That's not what I was saying, but I kind of want it now that you tell me about this idea. Hmm.
---
No just being lazy, the scyophants they have as customers will go along with it and even defend it.
---
Last info they had on it was some random tweet saying they would let us know more info back in summer of 2018 so yeah. I'm guessing they just don't care about it.
---
yeah I play in spa√±olo (spanish xd)
---
I‚Äôm finishing mine today, love the throwback to Kings fall
---
Yeah, the sweaty try-hards don't play comp after they're done.  They come over to quickplay to dominate you with their Not Forgottens.
---
Just got a wardcliff coil from the engram
---
feelsgoodman.jpg
---
G Fucking G! That was lit!!
---
So did you win?
---
Sorry for asking but what is a scyophant?
---
I meant the "Caydes note"
---
*curses in bad RNG*
---
Good man!
---
The first thing that u got said the truth "wish no more" üòÅüòÅüòÅ

1kv, huh that's a strange way to spell blade barrage...
---
I‚Äôve ran from 350-650 on all three characters in the last 3 weeks. Run all your guys through their weekly milestones and bounties if you can. Make sure to equip your highest gear and weapons on whichever character you‚Äôre running on and you should have no problem leveling up 
---
My favorite thing to do in destiny since d1 is solo pve content, I remember when I could just sit way back with icebreaker and slow clear an entire nightfall solo. Especially the giant ogre one and the original fallen cosmodrome dungeon.
---
Basically if Cabal have the Turrets they liquify my teammates, Same with Skree. I think hive have the most beat down though, Wizards, Shriekers, and Knights all do alarming amounts of burst damage to people exposed.
---
You‚Äôve seen people using chat outside of BMing in Gambit or Crucible? Damn, with that kind of RNG luck you‚Äôve probably got like 20 1KVs in your vault...
---
No I understand that. I'm asking if I can still get Not Forgotten because it's not the previous season anymore
---
sweet!
---
Good job mate! 
---
I know I have see this dude driving before... Whuddup ohio guardians! 
---
I say save it since they'll be a point when you'll get really poor really fast
---
Oh frick you right. Still screamed when I got it tho üòÖ
---
EDZ, winding cove, on the ledge next to the crashed Fallen dropship.
---
That gives me an idea. I should camp at that bridge and ask passing low level guardians for a toll for me to kill it and let them through.
---
Sounds weird, but the earlier ways of getting rid of glimmer are gone. You use to be able to purchase mods from the Gunsmith, but they removed those mods, so that‚Äôs out. Spider is really the only way
---
I've gotten Vex every single game in the last month. In November it was all Cabal.
---
Did you just unlock a forge this week? 
---
Super jealous . Brave 3 right now and currently tilted out of the game until I can find the composure to hop back in. This Luna‚Äôs howl grind has taken most of my sanity. Much luck to you brother !
---
Oh I thought you were implying that you got the gun on one character but didn‚Äôt have it on your second.
---
I love this 
---
It appears in a game they play in only one chapter... with the most horrifying zombies ever portrayed in any work of fiction in the entire history of mankind
---
Hey that guys name is yemum
---
Has nothing to do with unlocking a forge but carrying over a frame from last week and completing it. Then the next frame you do as a powerful eliminates other frames. 
---
It's a bug. 
---
Brother, I made this meme myself.  Don‚Äôt try to steal from me.  
---
I need to find people like this, I've never done a raid, because I have random windows when I can play
---
and they then go for 15 and die on the way back
---
hmm ok, I guess ill just keep on grinding crucible and hopefully get it.
---
It's hidden in between all the others I haven't had time to complete yet lmao
---
CoD is like destiny if all there was to do was the crucible 
---
LOL...yeah, I know.
---
Then why not use the clip of you "discovering" this? When you make a post with "Today I found out" and then use a clip like this, it doesn't make sense. I don't know, just not sure why you wouldn't use the one where it happened naturally. 
---
Oh and this is pretty common knowledge by most players by now.
---
getting downvoted is not that big of a deal. it just means people didnt get the joke and thought you were serious.
---
idk bout getting verbally assaulted tho
---
Recovery makes a much bigger difference than resilience. If you jump and dodge enough to not get hit, it is possible for your health to regenerate without having to hid behind cover. 
---
A lot of enemy projectiles are quite slow-traveling, which is why this is possible. 
---
Looks like shit inventory to me too.  I would never use any of those items.
---
Lol that‚Äôs the silliest bug I‚Äôve heard.
---
Prime attunment stays as long as you're under 600(or should) after 600 you get attunment only for your first prime of the day. 
---
Attunment should only increase your chances at a prime especially your first one each day after daily reset. Iirc you can get primes without it just your chances are alot lower without it.
---
He didn't claim, he asked. You were doing ok for a while there, but you seem to have embraced full troll mode again. Remember how good it felt for a day or so when you weren't trying to make people feel stupid? This is a place to come to ask questions and have discussions.
---
Some days it feels like everything is hitting harder 
---
I was just there! 
---
That shit got me dancing 
---
Someone get this Guardian the "absolutely correct" emblem
---
Universal remote was no match for a god roll party crashed pre nerf. 
---
A N G E R Y
---
(seriously though, good job)
---
Pretty sure you have to buy it again.
---
I have been killed by my sleeper more times than I care to count, dating back to D1. Not my proudest moments.
---
Lol I never hold more than 6 or 7. Phalanxes are the best blockers.
---
That's true, especially since they for some reason have to power to launch someone into oblivion.
---
You son of a bitch. *upvote
---
Thanks for the opinions gang! I first saw this type of service when I played The Division. At first it surprised me that people actually paid for others to accomplish things in your own account. I'm not a huge crucible player so grinding for PvP specific gear won't likely happen for me but I can live without the gear if I didn't earn it through my own effort. 
---
2 runs in the new raid and i already got the helmet 4 times...but hey I have 1k after 8ish tries üòÖ
---
Pfft. My Civ V log time proves those to be the workings of a casual
---
Is there text chat in ps4????? Or only xbox?? If I missed this the while time I've played d2 I will be so disappointed in myself, as it could've helped in soooo many situations:'(
---
Amen to that!!!
---
Say what you will about the toxicity involved in some PvP, the overall community is awesome.
---
Thank you for continuing the guardians helping guardians tradition friend!!!!
---
True true, I think I‚Äôm doing decent with being lvl 50 509
---
Looks like you walked into a war with the - oh, oh okay.
---
You seemed to care enough to stop by to whine about the OP complaining? Plus your STILL whining!! 
---
If you're lookin for a sign to buy a lottery ticket, this is it fam
---
Actually, if you‚Äôre using a grenade launcher or rocket launcher, enemy projectiles seem to count as physical objects, and can make your explosives detonate much earlier than you‚Äôd like. 
---
I notice Taken majors are especially guilty of doing this, but I think the Tank shot detonated your rocket. 
---
Reminds me of the guy I helped carry through a nightfall. 
---
Yes.
---
Well that was a lot 
---
Not the meme the content you commented on my post 2 days ago about this and you were like oh this is really interesting didn‚Äôt know this so put credit where it‚Äôs due bud 
---
You can‚Äôt be talking about balance &amp; in the same breath say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt complain about OP weapons &amp; armor‚Äù lol. &amp; snipers don‚Äôt need less flinch in my opinion. Destiny is by far the easiest FPS game to snipe in. They‚Äôre long range 1 shot weapons. Not long range ‚Äúlet‚Äôs shoot back &amp; forth &amp; chip each others health down‚Äù weapons. 
---
Just play the game normally, lol. "hard to get"
---
But I didn‚Äôt have a rocket equipped 
---
I‚Äôm happy to be proud of this community. Much love to all of you. 
---
Snipers need more ammo.  
---
Removing flinch would make them OP and break another gun. 
---
If snipers carried twice the ammo or gave ammo on kills, they would be balanced. 
---
The imbalance currently, is shotguns, naturally grab more ammo, just running through kills. 
---
Snipers do not, so you end up with one gun in ur hands a lot. 
---
I could have sworn...and now the clip refuses to replay for me. 
---
What did you have equipped?
---
Nope. Buying on one platform won't grant you access on the other. 
---
My monitor refresh rate is at 60hz and the game also had it set to 60hz
---
cod doesnt feel as good when shooting
---
You wanna join up also? No biggie if you don‚Äôt just wondering haha 
---
And he hasn't posted in almost a year so it's not like he's doing anything to improve the sub. He just spreads negativity and it makes me sad. 
---
Use highest piece of light level. A 600 blue piece is way more powerful than a 500 purple. Granted purple might have better perks but light level should always be goal. Then when max light level adjust the perks to your style.
---
I got 1k voices and the masterworked chattering bone out of my first ever raid chest. Bring it.
---
Ehh, a couple phalanxes backed up by a knight can be good off the enemy isn‚Äôt a 3 or 4 stack honestly. But only if there‚Äôs at least a couple phalanxes. Same deal goes for an ogre on Kell‚Äôs Grave just because of eye blast actually.
---
I had a pulse, shotgun and the whisper equipped. My friend who was carrying the tank piece did have a rocket on though :)
---
can't tell if serious but round 2, you the dunkable area shrinks to just the glowing core, so you need to be accordingly more accurate lol
---
Do all challenges that say ‚Äúpowerful gear‚Äù
---
If you have the dreaming city unlocked get the weekly bounty from petra and complete blind wells. Theres usually enough people there to carry you through them and you get a powerful gear and a seed of light for the first completed Well. Once you complete the bounty you can get ‚Äúoffering to the oracle‚Äù which you can bring to the oracle for the third seed of light
---
Holy shit! And congratulations!
---
You should buy the collection of D1 if you‚Äôre tight on money. It‚Äôs leaps &amp; bounds better than Vanilla D2 &amp; it‚Äôs still active. It‚Äôs pretty cheap as well. 
---
why do i need to watch a video to have this discussion
---
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BRING TAKEN OGRE DESTRUCTION TO THE SITH, NOT AID THEM!!!
---
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BRING VICTORY TO OUR TEAM, NOT LEAVE US IN RUIN!!!
---
You are already wrong if you are hoarding 10+, save only if doing a bounty.
---
I think its fine how it is.   I dont miss having to run 6 raids a all. 
---
I said reduce not remove, and that's true ik I'm not a developer so I dont know what to say about the ammo economy right now, maybe have banshee sell a sniper telemetry for ammo like in d1 but only for snipers
---
No one's getting banned.
---
Speaking of, did you get banned from /r/DestinyTheGame again? And that's why you're here being generally miserable?
---
If you're so unhappy, *please*, just leave. 
---
General Reposti!
---
From my point of view the Vanguard is evil!
---
Who knows at this point. It‚Äôs frustrating that there isn‚Äôt much about this problem being talked about
---
What is that chest piece, second from the right? Eververse?
---
because the way you power up is by getting higher and higher EQUIPPABLE gear?
---
What console? I need to do that too, but I won‚Äôt be on till tomorrow
---
Laughing Warframe player grinding a item to grind another with it.
---
I dont think it needs to be reduced either. 
---
Keep the purples that might have good rolls though
---
I‚Äôm getting old...or I‚Äôm hallucinating. 
---
Either way, bad Tank. 
---
Its a known bug. If you carried over a frame from last week and completed it it will remove one of the current frames. Best practice is to not carry over frames from the week before until they find a fix
---
it's short and sweet. my quickest run just with rando lfgs with one new player that i was semi-sherpaing was 32 minutes. this is with no skips and full explanations.
---
it has a lot of movement, action, i like the divisions into roles so people can play to their different strengths, there's vehicles, and the boss fight is incredibly straightforward but reliant on good communication/rhythm
---
it's rewarding without feeling like i'm taking a test at school
---
I mean, "Nobody cares." kinda does imply to OP to get lost, so i would call it mildly hateful, though it isn't alot
---
this bug has been known for about 2 wks, how long is it taking bungie to fix this? I'm afraid this is gonna happen again the next week from what i've read in other threads. :(
---
my favorite thing ever on my hunter is Better Already or that other health perk on your class item
---
pair it with a masterworked gun and it's free heals all day
---
edited it to have full explanation without need to watch the video
---
Im the second comment, as soon as I saw the first question I was gonna comment the same drifter quote but the bastard beat me by around 30 minutes.
---
The difference is that CoD has had about 10 separate games to change and hasn't really. They're successful though, so I can't blame them. 
---
edited it to include all talking points without need to watch video
---
The daily Heroic adventure today, the cliff~ something 
---
You‚Äôre not wrong...but the Dunemarchers are my favorite Titan exotic (currently), and they‚Äôre amazing. 
---
I mean, it would be nice if Xur started off 2019 with Forsaken goodness, but it could‚Äôve been worse. 
---
it's for the diamond run
---
It was a last season quest. If you had it in your inventory when the season ended you could still complete it. If you didnt have it or deleted it before the season ended you're out of luck 
---
Well, if the first invader already passed and they aren‚Äôt close to the next one... I don‚Äôt see why not. 
---
As long as it isn‚Äôt Kell‚Äôs Grave. Worst. Map. Ever.
---
Sanguine Alchemy is garbage
---
What clan ? And u have space in ur clan? I wanna join
---
Just imagine also doing malfeasance 
---
Does this mean Cayde is Kirito?
---
Decided to enter a game of Comp too find my lone self against a four stack... I attempted to make friends with high fives and chest bumps, however they refused my advances, so I decided my KD wasn't worth it and left.
---
I got Ikelos shotgun, orpheus rig and tractor cannon from a single EP boss today
---
It was definitely more fun though. 
---
I only ever used No Backup Plans when I also had Immobious (that Defender Titan-specific Shotgun that...I think automatically reloaded when inside an Armor of Light Ward of Dawn) equipped. 
---
Extremely niche, but very fun when there wasn‚Äôt a Nova Bomb or Golden Gun coming towards me. 
---
Thats only for power lvls not exotic drops anyone under 600 will get higher light and get more often powerful gear
---
Well i find PvE content in Destiny 2 boring &amp; I hate when I have to play it to unlock a weapon. I push through it anyway until I get what I want. Sometimes you just have to do what‚Äôs required if you feel like you really want something. I don‚Äôt have Ace on my 2 alts because finding the Cayde stashes again sounds less fun than watching Destiny 2 install. If the grind isn‚Äôt worth it then the weapon probably isn‚Äôt either. Trust me, if you‚Äôre not a PvP player then you aren‚Äôt going to be using Ace that much. 
---
That‚Äôs hot
---
Nice. They are adorable at that age.
