Ya I agree I made a human female warlock and Im probably gonna change to a female exo.

Anteus wards gang
---
KRONK!
---
Also I just noticed I can purchase Reddit coins. What do these coins do and have you bought or used any?
---
I mean wishender, rat king, sweetbusness, sunshot ect. aren't great either.
---
You're wrong about the damage buff part. Killing tally is max 65% in PvE while its 12% max in PvP.
---
You LOVE to see it!
---
Ah, a duke user those are rare.
---
???
---

---
The gun is very easy to use on console, it does need a nerf so there might be a reason to use something else
---
Prolly gonna get nerfed to much and end ip in the voult keeping Luna company.
---
You're welcome! Haha no worries, It's all good.
---
 Some enemies don't have shields others do.
---
 Example: Hive wizards in gambit/gambit prime (when your primevil is up) are void shielded which is why you should use a void weapon when taking them down.
---
You can use whatever weapon, but you'll have to use a few extra bullets if you're not using void.
---
*Enemies with a colored aura around them are shielded. 
---
 
---
you can identify the shield by the color. 
---
Void= purple
---
Arc= blue
---
Solar = Red/Orange
---
Banks 1-2 motes
---
Just meant to be a joke tbh. Sorry I like to use scouts and want them to be viable
---
K but where can I get my own!?
---
There is so many better options for crucible than recluse on console. It's way better on PC for pvp and playing comp I see more people running hc shotty or hc snipe
---
That‚Äôs literally me in every game I play
---
/r/lostredditors
---
You can also easily out range someone using recluse.
---
Rise Up üò§
---
I have no idea to be honest with you. I just post my cat and comment on other's stuff to help them out or give feedback.
---
Blockers are Taken enemies that that hinder progress in Gambit/Gambit Prime
---
Motes are collectible items what you use to send blockers to the enemy team and what you have to use to summon a special Taken boss you have to kill or damage enough to win.
---
I laughed so hard!! üòÇüòÇ
---
Isn‚Äôt it going to get nerfed again with the barricade adjustment. Auto reload is becoming 
---
On a side note. I‚Äôm one fusion kill from finishing the quest. I‚Äôm at light 680. Should I boost light level higher or just unlock now and level up the gun?
---
What gamemode is this .-.
---
Thankfully I have the opposite problem. I am terrible at this game and can't kill anything to save my life, but I can jump with the best of em
---
Was it that bad in PvE?
---
I second this, really want to play but don‚Äôt know how or where to
---
Rat king is great? It does exactly what its meant to do and it does it very well
---
I played destiny 2 for the first few months and the game kinda petered out. Is it actually active?
---
Honestly I think that just getting rid of feeding frenzy is enough. And that upon reload, master of arms goes away.
---
Honestly, I've always been surprised that we don't have the ability to change our appearance - especially since it would have been a great (but crappy) monetization opportunity. I'd love for the ability to change my race/gender, but there's just no way I'm going to delete my character and start over just for that.
---
how the hell do you guys have such great accuracy in FPS games? any tips on how to get better with that?
---
Couldn't agree moreüëç
---
My main beef is with he guns themselves. Precision frame hand cannons are an absolute joke and there is a reason they are so meta on console (I dont have PC perspective)
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people who have earned these guns feel the need to use it every single game with dust rock and wardcliff. Because of this I feel they deserve the bag. If you don‚Äôt then that‚Äôs fine. But I will keep bagging because in my opinion they are way too easy to use and this amount of sweat in QP is just unnecessary. 
---
And before someone says it, yes I have both lunas and NF.
---
The guy that just fell to his death is me
---
I legit have every warlock exotic because xur wouldn't give me Luna factions until they were the last thing I needed. That also happened to be the same week their nerf got announced. Fuck X√ºr
---
Tought it was a cool AI interaction, sorry.
---
It would be okay by me if instead of nerfing recluse, they made Tarrabah a legendary and Recluse an exotic.
---
Get close and use a shotgun. I will agree that it should be able to out-range fusion rifles but they are a great counter to hand cannons. Honestly, use cover and get close with a shotty; they should panic and either backpedal or go airborne. Listen for the charge and when they fire or cancel, slide out and shoot 'em down. Cover is your friend.
---
Just wanna say thank for not immediately going with recluse, feels like the business end of that thing is all I see lol
---
The biggest mistake in this instance was not changing his password afterwards.
---
Recluse melts way more than I thought holy fuck
---
Hold up.
---
So being a dumass and not running away is ‚Äùoutplaying him‚Äù?
---
His icon hasn‚Äôt shown on the map for months
---
There needs to be a cap on fucking invasions because it gets really annoying really fast.
---
&gt;Guy invades
---
&gt;I kill him
---
&gt;He gets to try again 5 times because his team is snowballing away
---
They only appear during the public event, even then, it's 50/50 between that and minotaurs

Shiny gun
---
Leave my sunshot out out of this.
---
I mean for what's it worth not everyone is going to get much fun of getting a bunch of kills with a gun they may not even specialize in while having to go through multiple matches of specific PvP modes.
---
Which reminds me... Methinks the next crucible pinnacle will be a shotty
---
Ok guys make sure you only attack him one at a time. 
---
What if we all attack him at once?
---
No, no he's the good guy, he's got to win.
---
Looking at my profile? ;)
---
Been going for Reckoner lately in my experience it‚Äôs Truth
---
They all deserve that, cause some one should‚Äôve came around the back &amp; tried to distract him.

Getting a team to work together on this map is fucking impossible.

It seems the video was sped up slightly, pay attention to the achievement he gets and you‚Äôll see that it pops up waaay too fast. Hope that helps.
---
Then you have guns like Jade Rabbit, which takes the exotic slot without needing to be powerful or unique
---
Yep, right into my table
---
Iirc it was 30. Either way, in pve the range is barely gonna matter. And 22.5 is still a great buffs.

I mean... I would say something, but I'm exactly the same just much more... Verbal. I do mute myself when I do though, save my squad from the verbal blowout.
---
that isnt really all that much tbh
---
I feel this so hard.
---
Perhaps
---
But that‚Äôs just because of how the gun feels. If you get a 150 scout with a good roll, there‚Äôs no reason to use Jade Rabbit. It looks unique, but it doesn‚Äôt feel unique at all.
---
That was back when midnight club LA came out. Was doing a race with a motorcycle and kept losing even with perfect runs. Didn‚Äôt hit anything, didn‚Äôt slow down too much. Car passes me in the last stretch. That self adjusting difficulty was straight bull. After losing 10-15+ times, it dialed the AI back.

The skybox designs in Destiny have always been beautiful

I know right! I love walking around with no hud it so dope

Oh mate me and two friends have had a whole properly established Hide and Seek game with actual rules + scoring lmao

Sounds fun do you just play where ever?

When ham on emm
---
Hunter's just have it genetically encoded within them to bag in PVP
---
I agree with him,I hate fags like you when I‚Äôm trying to get mountaintop using the shitty fighting lion
---
All you need to do is convince Devirm to give it to you.

Ah, ok. So that's the smg I hear all the rave about
---
Was it just some weird coincidence then?
---
Only got to play it once. I thought it was blind well
---
What is that SMG he's using?  
---
PS. I'm new lol
---
I can tell by that comment alone that you don't have Not Forgotten and haven't played much console PvP.
---
Run along now. Troll elsewhere.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
I do have Luna‚Äôs tho, just NF with less rangeü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è call me a troll if you like I‚Äôll keep bagging you when I outrange you with ACE or a pulse üòò
---
It‚Äôs just a good example. TLW has an 8 round clip, and has no damage buffs other than hip fire crits.
---
Recluse has one of, if not the most manageable recoil pattern in the game, ricochet rounds, benefits from kills from any other weapon regardless of slot, and a generous clip for its subtype.
---
The guns fill the same niche in drastically different ways. At least TLW punishes you harder for missing, AND it‚Äôs an Exotic.
---
People in the clip are dumb, I just used it to illustrate how badly the gun needs a rework. Hopefully we get one next season.
---
Recluse is busted
---
Did you win this match?
---
Yes and no. In a way, yes, for the simplicity of murdering everything in sight as usual. In a way, no, because it‚Äôs a fraction more situationally demanding.
---
And they don‚Äôt stop coming and don‚Äôt stop coming!
---
My favorite as well, the balls that warlock had to put a well down in the bubble. He‚Äôs the man
---
The bridge isn't out in the open imo.

---
Oh is that all? Just win more 4head!
---
I'm talking pvp. It has one of the lowest aim assist stats of most year two handcannons and ace of spades definitely outshines the sunshot.
---
What is the gun he‚Äôs using that‚Äôs not a pistol?
---
When you are 750 it‚Äôs all about the weapons and their rolls, what weapons do you usually use in PvE?
---
You ever used rabbit on equinox, that one city map, dead cliffs, or that one Nessus map with the B zone on that vex platform? Those are all a amazing for The Jade Rabbit, and it is amazing on Console due to 0 recoil, 100 AA, Long zoom, crispy handling, 0 flinch, and nice ornaments
---
You where both in the wrong 
---
If you have nf your obviously really good and should be using nf in quick play
---
And your right that you it‚Äôs okay to use a gun you worked hard for
---
Good format
---
I used to think that too and absolutely hated PvP in d1. Being close to finishing a pinnacle quest due to iron banner made me pursue and earn recluse, which changed my mind. If you truly want a great challenge against others and a testament to your own skill  PvP is where it‚Äôs at.
---
Ok?
---
For the moment I try some different weapons but I stuck with the Ace of spades
---
Nice
---
Nope it‚Äôs gonna be a sidearm
---
Which joystick are you using if I may ask? I may want to give it a try as I‚Äôm not enjoying WASD since going cross save.
---
You killed him with trust at shotgun range.
---
Google is your friend for future reference.
---
Well there's more than one.
---
Revoker though.
---
Faction rallies was a y1 activity, similar schedule as to how iron banner works, where you would pledge to 1 of 3 factions. You could level up your faction by earning tokens and handing them in (similar to Zavala or shaxx). When you got to level 50 with the vendor, you would get the relevant catalyst (which where sunshot, sweet business and graviton Lance). However, factions is being reworked rn so they moved the sunshot, graviton lace and sweet business catalysts to random drops from playlist strikes and crucible (there may be more places they can drop from).
---
Nice...
---
He's challenging me "cmon do it" ahah
---
You have to wait til it comes out on steam
---
Yeah perks and supers are strong, but they are the core of the game. But the radar is something that can be changed easier and can make a huge impact to the flow of the game, which is needed after all this time. 
---
In D1 it was less of a problem, because the maps where bigger than the D2 maps. And because something has been like this since alpha, it doesnt mean that it is still good for the game and that it should not receive tweaks. 
---
The shotgun, roaming super meta is so effective because you always know where the enemy is at and you can get a lot of kills that way, with the help of a game mechanic that makes people with less skill better. People that arent so good should improve, not just get handed so much information. The skill gap has to increase and tweaking the radar is one way of doing that.
---
You know that we actually have to deal with recoil on console right? I guess that's why nothing is extremely broken on console (ahem except dust rock ahem). Also it takes half an hour to look in another direction...
---
Recluse doesn‚Äôt need a nerf because, honestly, in a lot of PvP maps you can‚Äôt use it effectively. It‚Äôs a low range weapon, so pulse rifles, hand cannons, snipers, heavy weapons, and even scout rifles (in some instances) can outgun it. And even shotguns, but it‚Äôs one of the better counter shotgun weapons.
---
Also, not every single person is running around with Recluse in the crucible.
---
#IT IS MEANT TO BE OVER POWERED IN A WAY BECAUSE IT IS A PINNACLE WEAPON.
---
Grinding for glory is one of the most challenging things in the game for average PvP players.

HAHAHAHAHA

Buy the chests on the ship in Nessus, buy the consumables from the robot, do the triumphs for the Menagerie, do the weekly bounties from the robot, etc.

" It is A separate chalice from the current quest."

And require u being good at crucible.
---
Nope.
---
Oh, that's sad. I hate when people ignore the lore, especially when they complain asking about why we're doing things in the game that I tried to explain to them weeks ago. 
---
I've heard a lot of people just say "hey, Oryx used to be a girl" and just leave it at that. I always go deep and analogize the transition to the fish that sometimes change sexes based off of needs, or how bees can transform into a queen after consuming the royal jelly

No no no! It's yeeeeeeesssssss?

So Fortnite, Apex Legends and Warframe to name a few have all paid DLCs?
---
I need revoker before reset too. And reset is on Tuesday.
---
My dude, this whole franchise needs fixing.
---
It has been a revolving door of constant shit since day one.
---
No one that plays these games have been consistently happy with them.
---
Dont get me wrong, i think Destiny is special and have been really optimistic about recent changes since the Bungie/Activision split, but i think we all need to recognize that Destiny as a whole isnt living up to its potential in any area.
---
i havent seen anyone do it
---
Totally agree
---
I call them‚Äùthe uncrowned exotics‚Äù
---
I like hiding behind the corner with my Truth when an invader with Hammerhead spawns in and just peak out real quick, launch the rocket.  Then runaway as they realize they dun goofed and watch the kill feed deny one more invader
---
Destiny collision is just weird, so just avoid it lol.
---
Random drop from strikes and crucible
---
Imo titan, even without OEM is top tier for PvP. Bottom tree striker, top tree void, synthoceps, mask of the quiet one, some of the best grenades... and B U B B L E
---
I'm talking about the feature itself, it's fine lol
---
You should‚Äòve added this Rick and Morty like betrayal theme tho
---
No, Fortnite and Apey6 Legends just have predatory "Passes" that are basically just cosmetics locked behind a paywall and require either grinding (thus ensuring higher playtime) or paying more to unlock
---
Warframe uses a different System based around bypassing the Grind inherent in its Systems by paying for Weapons and Frames. With a bunch of Cosmetics on top.
---
Maybe I should have said "a standard F2P Package for games that where initially B2P"
---
Vanguard. Not for Zavala or Ikora. For the Colonel.
---
with teammates yes, mp first is best. but when have melee builds been teammate friendly?? plus melting point does miles more damage than a normal melee so proccing one two punch first and then melting gives a huge chunk of burst damage. if you combine this with wormgod caress, 1-2 punch MP is the highest single hit damage number you can hit in the entire game. just doing shotgun melee shotgun melee without any buffs only results in the melee doing about the same damage as the shotgun blast which isn't a dps increase, it just means you have to shoot half as much saving you some ammo in the long run.
---
I do bro
---
Yes sir. Xbox is what im on. But if you and other guy do the referral I'll still be happy that someone got it. Just woke up.
---
First I‚Äôve seen this happen, weird
---
The Recluse. I just came back from not playing since Curse of Osiris myself. It‚Äôs definitely worth the grind.
---
It‚Äôs kinda hard to explain, I‚Äôm on Xbox later today so I can show you if you‚Äôd like, it requires jump boost and some patience
---
Oh nice. Coldheart which i already got from him not too long ago, chromatic fire which he's sold two or three times recently and the hunter exotic that is only useful when dodging which i never do. The titan chest is the only one that remotely interests me this week.
---
Think I'll just stay on bl3.
---
Chromatic Fire = Screen Goes Broke and PC goes BOOM
---
well in that case i agree
---
Keep yourself safe
---
Who knows? With Luna and barricade nerfs, Polaris Lance may be the go to dps weapon
---
In what way are they changing Tractor?
---
Nah it‚Äôs a scuffed raid
---
What does Revoker have to do with moments of Triumph? Is there a triumph to get fabled weapons?
---
69 and 420. Google their meaning
---
nice
---
It's me whenever my teammate pushes me into the flames
---
I've heard from him just yet, but I do apologise for jumping at the chance lol.
---
Oof I‚Äôm never gonna be able to get the recluse
---
Good luck man. I believe!
---
 As long as someone gets it then I'm happy, because well its what we do as a community. Work together
---
And here‚Äôs me cycling through different formatting codes in my edit when all I had to do was pre-2010 ‚Äúthis means I‚Äôm doing a thing‚Äù. 
---
Like *this*?
---
It's only going to provide a 30% buff to all elements now
---
arc web warlock, or doom fang bottom sentinel
---
Its encounter from menagerie
---
&gt;Because people like you are too stupid
---
Cmon man. I was t even neon combative.
---
Either way, the gun is a QP paper shredder and does too much work when it shouldn‚Äôt. It needs a balance, sorry.
---
Breakneck with a rampage spec.
---
You may have missed the point.
---
Indeed
---
It's the menagerie. A 6 person matchmaking mode on the leviathan. It's pretty dopes
---
their name doesn‚Äôt look like it feels so good...
---
I feel that. Did 25 comp games last night, only need 7 more bounties. I can taste it!
---
It‚Äôs the same as the glitch to see shaders on exotics but it uses the skin of exotics on normal weapons
---
I'm on-topic with my topic. My point was that in some cases, SOME CASES, the enemies outmatch you severely that it is impossible to fight back. IN SOME CASES, and they dont have NF most of the times, ace gets the job done for them. IN SOME CASES, NOT EVERY GAME
---
Fake everyone knows girls don't play video games
---
Theres no point in getting these op weapons and rolls if i can do everything a player with god rolls can do already so whats the grind for? I thought the story was great but after this it just felt like running around occasionally shooting things
---
That‚Äôs what I thought, but I figured I‚Äôd still share it as this looks much cooler than the typical shotgun
---
Thanks for the detailed answer I appreciate it. So, if I have all the DLC, I can get everything that's been released?. Is there anything cool that's now locked out for me? Like any one-time event stuff that's not available anymore.
---
Yes yes yes yes yes
---
With cross save you are choosing an account with Bungie to play on across all platforms.  This is your "account" per se unless  you turn off cross-save at some point. If you turn off cross-save at some point you would have a bungie account for each platform you play on.  So if you never played on PC prior to cross save and turned off cross save you would have to start over on PC, but would still have your PS4 characters just like they are.
---
Yo, just read shit, it‚Äôs everywhere.
---
Sorry bro I'm new to reddit my bad
---
AHHHHH sorry this is a new char so talking to zavala for the first time solved it.
---
I‚Äôm gonna go out on a limb and say yes, although it hasn‚Äôt been confirmed yet. You‚Äôre using two different launchers who look for games in different places. Assume the worst.
---
With randoms you never know where they‚Äôre at in terms of experience. They may just be learning the ropes, or maybe they‚Äôre just grinding out completions. Triumphs may not be on their mind (and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that). If you‚Äôre grinding triumphs, it‚Äôs always better to do it in a group that understands your objectives - friends or LFG. Expecting randoms to know you want a triumph isn‚Äôt realistic.
---
At this point your main focus should be opening the forges and upgrading your chalice for menagerie while hording materials.  Everything you have will jump to 750 on Oct1, no need to grind light.  Forges let you choose 2 weapons/character/week to forge at power level, and menagerie lets you choose 3 power rewards per character per week.  If you have ever cursed Rahool for giving you that 25th edge transit in a row and no boots you want these things open and ready for light grinding.
---
Or when you die right as the boss dies
---
Outbreak perfected, exotic quest gun
---
Yeah I totally did
---
I got one from a Nessus Public event today-. Graviton Lance
---
Why were all tgese comments negative
---
Yea, are engrams returning, I got one in the crucible the other day. Aren‚Äôt they supposed to instantly decode?
---
Appears to be just for symmetry
---
Then they take the dead Caterpillar and go talk to some worms in the center of the earth a-la Brandon frasier and get some more magical caterpillars and then one of them gets a sex change, the end.
---
But it does look like it's from the black garden so it's either a raid quest or a vex invasion quest
---
[deleted]
---
Did the engram say " I'll be your huckleberry"?
---
NLB was probably my favorite exotic from D1, but it would be completely and utterly broken on PC if it were to come back. So I kinda hope it stays in D1. :(
---
Hey sick bud thanks for sharing!
---
Before or after they have killed you?
---
You need to shoot it with the corresponding damage type. Blue = Arc, Orange = Solar, Purple = Void and Red = Hit with Rasputin's javelin. 
---
There are 45 on Mars in total and I can't remember what you get for hitting them all.
---
Sad that everyone else is risking their life and he's not apart of it
---
What are they called?
---
I mean well yeah kind of
---
He does seem that kind of guy
---
A sparrow and an exotic sword
---
Shoot them with the element that matches the color. There are 45 around and if you shoot 35 you get the worldline zero sword and shooting all 45 gets you the Mars sparrow
---
What are they called
---
After
---
And i still need to find two guardians to run through it all
---
Hit it with arc damage, blue arc, white any damage, red solar, purple void, red and crackling with energy the valkryie. You get 35 and get a exotic arc sword all 45 and you get a exotic sparrow
---
How does one turn on chat?
---
It‚Äôs probably the Fighting Lion that gets you bagged because it‚Äôs a pretty annoying weapon to deal with. But also OEM Strikers are gonna OEM Striker.
---
Technically test nodes, but it's not super important.
---
Mars fragments I think. Just look at the map of Mars and at the bottom right  it says how many you have out of 45
---
Data nodes? It‚Äôs in the corner of the map screen for mars
---
No problem man!
---
‚ÄúTHIS IS AMAZING!‚Äù
---
Nah most of it will probably be timegated, roadmap already shows a few exotics we have to wait to get mid/end of October :/
---
Hatemail for owning and using a NF is like a guy on a bike talking shit to the guy using a Ferrari. ‚ÄúWHY DO YOU USE IT, YOU DONT EVEN NEED TO GO FAST?‚Äù
---
That probably felt awful. Try contacting support with the vid.
---
Nice nice :D
---
Wait was truth from menagerie. I dont even remember feels like a year ago
---
I don‚Äôt have either of those but the those are exotics so this way it gives you another option if you want to run a primary or energy exotic
---
That's some badass abilities!
---
You going to jail for that. No means no.
---
That girl a Nobushi?
---
What pants are those
---
Yes, you got the first Quest step from the Ogre Boss (can't remember its name).
---
Could have been terrabah too but with my luck I never get raid exotics. I‚Äôll try
---
Works for me. Had the week booked off for my birthday. And oh boy am I glad my birthday falls on a Tuesday this year
---
Thank you

ALl HAIL LORD SHAXX!!

A substinence rampage gnawing hunger is going to hella lit
---
Use https://lowlidev.com.au/destiny/
---
Takes a bit to get used to but it'll show you any corrupted eggs and triumph scannables that you're missing, you just have to change the filters on the map.
---
F
---
And really there's a lot that are 'timegated' cause there's things in each ascendant challenge, which changes every week.
---
I have a rampage and fourth times the charm and a swashbuckler and rapid hit one

You have to. Otherwise you can't login on the bungie net to do the transfer.
---
No need, no way bungie would allow something like that, I'm pretty sure that's the exact reason they removed self rez warlocks.
---
Getting killed by a bow is humiliating.  These egoist guardians are getting salty over it 100%.
---
You can play the base campaign up to level 20. I think if you‚Äôre unsure about if the game is for you, play it for a while and then worry about what else you want to get, in terms of DLC and expansions.
---
Was that an ice age reference?
---
The hand and the puppy's face seals the deal for me XD
---
Is this my chance to complain about how busted melees are in this game?
---
EP is only on the curated.
---
I started saving glimmer last week when I was full and saw someone saying it was the best thing to do. Already got 20 sparrows, how many should I save? Not sure what is the end goal on this but I\`m all in.
---
That's true, I guess that works.
---
But just another question:
---
Why infinite ammo? Wouldn't that be op
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
They are getting way better at time gating things. I think a good formula would be half of the content up front and then trickle the rest throughout the season, with something really good towards the end that gets people back in right around the time they are hyping the next season
---
I mean it's not an energy sword it's sword from "the 14th century" which is where I'm guessing the manga Berserks time is set. Why would it need ammo?
---
Seriously why DO people do that? It cant be enjoyable
---
You made your own fancy sword flight
---
WITH A HAMMER!
---
Circle jerk?
---
Thanks man
---
The logic adds up, but I just thought it would be too op
---
Bug-Out Bag with swashbuckler and zen moment shreds.
---
Maybe try lfg for a team? Lfg teams are always iffy but that might be your best bet to get a streak going
---
Thank you so much I would have kept doing this for ages
---
Flawless answer. üëç
---
maybe add ammo count, the sword becomes dull when its out and when you recharge it re sharpens?
---
Did someone do the raid for you and you don‚Äôt know, since you‚Äôre pretty adamant about not having done it, unless you‚Äôre memory is bad?
---
‚ÄúAdvanced Suffering‚Äù
---
Unsettling. But delicious.
---
What is this, smash bros?
---
No, it's just a regular human mother
---
I think I have 29 I kills whit void titan, not even close
---
It looks like everyone is after the Warlock
---
I just answer your question
---
F for Cayde... may his life be gambling in heaven
---
i believe it‚Äôs ‚ÄúClouds at Sea‚Äù, looks damn good.
---
Sure! It's Gravendoom#1914
---
Yeah ik. Thanks for the feedback!
---
Vex with hydras are THE WORST. destroys a game every time.
---
*shudders in slow TTK meta where standing on the other side of the map with other people was the only viable option*
---
You need forsaken to do nightfalls with score
---
