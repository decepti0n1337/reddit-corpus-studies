Me 2 except we still killed it
---
---
---
I've done it twice now. Just throw near the top of the forge between rounds while the forge is not active.
---

---
I think it has something to do with the invisible cone on top of the forge that keeps you from jumping on top of it.
---
I was Top tree striker with skullfort, I had a blast furnace, last man standing, and colony
---
r/warlocksriseup
---
Because some of them are taken from D1
---
Fair gameplay wasn’t my main argument I was just repeating your comment and saying it was a factor but a small one.  But fair enough.
---
That’s not really the point tho, some people don’t enjoy spamming grenades or always having abilities. 
---
The PvP players shouldn’t be forced to play one play style during a majority PvE event.
---
Sounds like most of his matchmaking.  Unbalanced.
---
Made me reminisce the “snipe the rez” days in destiny 1 ToO.
---
“PUSH ME, PUSH ME!”
---
I didnt say it was high level. If you know a camper is sitting in a corner on A and you keep rushing in alone when everyone has in game chat you're an idiot. 
---
Its competitive and you have a team. If majority of your opponents team is running arc hunter subclasses guess whose running void hunter with class ability cooldown for near infinite invisibility. It's not rocket science
---
Just like pve players should have to completely stop using nova warp because it was nerfed into the ground until a recent buff?
---
Congrats, did my strat work?
---
Nerfs machine guns by 21% introduces 21% delirium
---
Nope, it just takes time and determination. And a shitload of gambit grinding.
---
First time?
---
it's an input translator that lets you play with mouse and keyboard on console. Last I checked it was $100-200.
---
What could the color for mythical be, I’m thinking neon red, or midnight blue something that says mythical
---
Earth: nuclear war
---
Mars: humanity’s hope
---
Titan: another part of humanity’s hope (oblivion)
---
Right, I was there for the event
---
Well dang, I didn’t expect this to become so controversial. While I see both sides, to me it’s really about the principle. I have a job and work 40+ hours a week and a hobby that I invest time into but you guys gotta remember that whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
1 run in 20min?! We do all 3 runs in like 30min..
---
I don’t think that was humans but the traveler 
---
Because it did it on mars and it was on other moons and planets other than our moon before ending up here
---
Lies, deception
---
This is a very common problem. These will solve it: 
---
1. Playing one more comp game (doesn't matter if you win or lose)
---
2. Restarting the game
---
I love the community. The guys I beat in the clip were super chill, so I offered to help them out. Good things come to those who are kind
---
I wondered how long it would take one of our many threads to show up on Reddit (spartanlocke is my blog.) 
---
BRB gotta tell the lads.
---
Ok, i will try that. Thank you!
---
imagine paying money to buy a game and then paying more money to not play it
---
Yeah idk I dont really look at the time when doing those, last time I did it we waited a bit for someone and we had a glitch so we had to restart
---
I agree, I made a typo in my original response, they were the ones that sent the messages lol. I typically don’t send post game messages, and when I do it’s usually like “GG” or something along those lines. I don’t  see he point of salty messages. There’s always gonna be someone better than you, so why get so worked up over it. 
---
I was playing comp with a friend the other day, he was working on mountaintop. He sent  the other team a message asking if he could get two calculated projectory kills because that is all he needed. I was surprised they actually let him get the free kills it was super cool in return we left and gave them a free win.
---
Got it! Thanks!
---
Rose is what the Thorn was before Dredgen Yor became Corrupted...Hawkmoon was a D1 exotic that was added around the time Taken King was active, and was only available from nightfalls, Trails of Osiris, The Taken King, and Kings Fall
---
I'm erect rn
---
Good luck
---
You are the enemy of the people
---
Did you finally get one, OP?
---
Rose is rumored to be a new Exotic hand cannon lore wise it’s thorn before it was thorn and Hawkmoon was a popular exotic hand cannon from Destiny 1
---
I would like to point out that weapon changes, such as telesto, were done in a way as to not affect their power in pve, you’d think they could do the same with supers. As a player that plays both parts of the game, I hope they can balance things differently in d3 so they can nerf a super to the ground in PvP but it still is viable in pve. 
---
I know some people say that destiny is pve focused and that crucible shouldn’t matter, or even exist, but if bungie didn’t want the crucible in the game they wouldn’t have made it, and they definitely wouldn’t have written lore for it, and also shaxx is one of the best characters in the game.
---
I usually do whatever I want when it comws to bosses just because all of the supers are equally ineffective on most bosses like Calus or Riven.
---
meh, even though it was anon who said this, i doubt that Rose will exist, after all, it was corrupted to thorn. to my knowledge thorn was destroyed
---
i dont think you can reverse corruption on a gun that doesn't exist anymore, technically :p
---
iirc he was the guy who started the whole no crucible in d3 thing
---
furthers my ideal of never trusting a leaker regardless of how right they are, because theres always a time where they'll lie just for a little giggle. no disrespect tho, i'd do the same. :P
---
I'm a warlock main but I think my second character is gonna be a titan just cause of thundercrash
---
Yep. If all three of you die it spawns you at the boss fight.
---
SIVA based Machine Gun / Rocket Launcher is my bet.
---
‘But SIVA? Isn’t that old news?’
---
Nah - Failsafe had some on board the Exodus Black, and the Leviathan has a new infestation on board. Why else would Calus need our help?
---
Nice!!!
---
I kinda press the trigger a bit when I believe imma get a shot and then unpress it until I am sure of my shot. But I like fusion rifles so I'm used to it.
---
Hey man the fact they you got fabled is a testament to the fact that anyone can do it, good job
---
No
---
It may take over the meta since it's a great defense against cannons and shotguns with the distance and mobility.
---
No I play on pc
---
Yea , by the time u catch up they’re on a 3x skater buff
---
Awe dude .-. U were supposed to say some cool catch phrase! Lol
---
Just to chat? That's fuckin cool, man. Not sure how to get you on there. Do I need your email address or something?
---
other titan subclasses get to experience the power of skullfort without skullfort, easy for people to climb to fabled and deal with spectral. raids and pve stuff becoming easier for the average person to get into with improved melee, grenade and class ability. A free exotic that asks you to do nothing more than play to get. 
---
idk seems great to me
---
I actually had everything. Wanted to see if fated engram was was a forsaken exotic but its cool
---
Aren’t weapons like Prometheus and Cold Heart toned down in Pvp? Thought that was an indication they were separate. Cant think of anything off the top of my head that was unusable or substantially worse in pve because of a pvp nerf. Someone mentioned nova warp, but even before it got neutered I almost never saw people using it. So many better options.
---
Should have when with Destiny 1....a classic just like Atari!
---
There are good things and bad things about this event starting with the bad I was striding towards my NF and due to all the ability spam it has made comp unplayable in my opinion because it’s full of people who rely on ability spam instead of gunplay and smart play and. Now allows you to camp the objective spamming grenades. Another con is the whole engram problem where the loot drops are messed up 
---
The pros are the Verdant Forest is a fun activity where you can go just to chill out and see how many waves you can clear and compare with your friends and all the new decorations in the tower are always nice to see
---
Lost 400 points due to grenade spam
---
If it takes grenade spam to get to fabled then you should not have to Pinnacle weapons
---
I did!
---
I have The Ringing Nail with Rampage and Dragonfly with a Dragonfly mod on it. For me, that's my God-roll. Just keep running that frame until you get the roll you want. It'll happen. Hammerhead is awesome too. Pretty much every Black Armory weapon can roll to something awesome.
---
You may already know this but they have stated that any changes couldn't be made quicker than the end of the event so it's not going to be changed even though they have realized it was a mistake.
---
Ohhh, sorry dude, I read it wrong, sorry man I’m half high so yea, sorry dude, cool catch phrase tho! (Even tho I’m a titan main.. lol)
---
*looks at year 1 Dawning* Uhh, yeah, sure.
---
Same here. I actually got Graviton Lance from the engram though. That was nice.
---
Yeah the art direction on the blues and greens in the game is so much cooler than the art direction on most legendary weapons, I hope when D3 comes around they go on more of a D1 inspired art style
---
I mean I like the exotic hand cannons I just wish Destiny would release something different
---
It's bad because not skilled players are grenade spamming crucible and make playing in this event cancer and the arbalest is a sniper with no flinch for people who can't snipe
---
I believe you should complete gambit prime "tutorial" quest first
---
Oddly enough I could hear shaxx say that without thinking it sounded lame 
---
Maybe it’s the context change
---
Nice.
---
In fairness, pinnacle weapons are a stupid concept. So I cannot respect your opinion on this one.
---
nice plays!
---
There’s a lot more build potential for a titan regarding melees.  They’ve got 2 or 3 melee based exotics, which all also function much better than the hunters.  Also, hunters are mostly limited to the singular subclass tree for a melee build, whereas titans have pretty much any subclass tree at their disposal.
---
I like the idea of Pinnacle weapons when there done right
---
Use the cheese method if you’re having trouble. My friend and I 2 manned it.
---
what?!
---
and he says he'll be the asshole
---
Then you might as well stop whining about easy parts of the triumph.
---
I don't like competitive pinnacle weapons. For a host of reasons 
---
Not everyone has the time to grind this shit out, especially cause your comp score resets on season reset. Locking guns behind objectives that not everyone can complete is just plain rude
---
It makes me hate QP more than I already do. I'm constantly trying to do QP and getting fucking ruined by 3 stacks with Not Forgotten and random Luna's running around. And recluses lately.
---
I was actually buying shards lmao. Stopped at 420 by complete accident.
---
I feel like I'm one of the few people that hates how it feels because of the super low handling speed that makes it feel... clunky? I dunno
---
Oh no that comment was about me using my Luna. I need to focus on head shots and stop using it like my ikelos hc.
---
I've gotten two exotics from her from the Invitations, there's gotta be some increased droprate there
---
plant vs zombies is a single player game you cheat or mod whatever you do its a single player game there are no restriction i can do whatever i want and with the destiny i didn't know that i could get banned if cheat engine was running in the background.
---
The trade-off between linear fusion and sniper when they shared a slot was forgiveness. Typically heavy snipers out dps'd lines fusions but the fusions had much higher bodyshot numbers. Now that they split the slots and linear fusions got a damage buff.
---
Arbalest is in the kinetic slot so it's gonna share the old downsides it did compared to snipers back when they were both heavy, but Arbalest offers the ability to drop a shield in one shot, two shot the fallen captains in bergusia, increase teamshot damage potential in Gambit on shielded enemies, and makes a neat sound when you shoot it.
---
How do you not know you can get banned for that.........it’s cheats on a multiplayer game
---
IIRC it's named after a type of crossbow
---
 i recently installed cheat engine again after like 8 years if i knew i could get banned i wouldn't have installed it in the first place.
---
Maybe have some patience and take it as a lesson learned? Don't use cheats and dont spam the forums?
---
Video : [https://youtu.be/BEvstgbftdA](https://youtu.be/BEvstgbftdA)
---
latency again, happens all the time to me as well. shoulder charge an enemy titan at the same time they shoulder charge me, i die and my opponent goes off to shoulder charge someone else
---
Its good.. But id rather my sleepy or thunderlord as an exotic..
---
Its easy to get the orbs in some of the activities with a masterworked handcannon and alot of crits with the buff for orbs of light
---
Thunderlord is a tough exotic to beat. Still haven't been kind enough to the RnG gods for that to drop
---
I think it is fun to use in pvp but it wont be the best weapon to use and require some skill to shoot headshots. Think of it as a sniper without scope which can also one shot people while they pop their super.
---
As for pve i’ve tried it a couple times but it just did not give me the feeling it did a lot of damage. I did however do no research on how much damage it can actually do on bosses or in raides etc.
---
Are you not up to foresaken yet?
---
No just tryin to get ace of spades
---
I use cheat engine to have fun in the games that i used to play before there is nothing wrong being a programme installed in a computer you are just being narrow minded.
---
Lol okay, I waa too, I fell asleep. I think it was about 2am, not sure
---
RNGesus chooses those who participate.
---
What mark do you use ?
---
because we need to appreciate the smaller things in life
---
You don’t deserve Ace of Spades.
---
After reading some forums i know the reasons why i would have got banned i wasn't entirely sure what would have been the cause of the ban now people who are commenting below are only saying things about cheat engine now i am sure it was because of the cheat engine. Yea the only one who can testify is myself which is also one of the drawbacks i have that is why i want someone from bungie to see this and understand me and i wont do mistake like this ever again and i have uninstalled cheat engine too and i'll never use it again.
---
Yah you need more upvotes in this thread. 
---
/u/saucy__boi77  being a sham stealing your content without giving credit.
---
They are, just look at the 4 other BA exotics and Arbalest.
---
I had no idea, thanks for telling me
---
Yeah, and I had to be up at 6:30am Haha Ugh! What a great Monday...
---
I actually got my NF during the revelry.  People run nade spam we switch to do the same or run riskrunner.
---
Credited you in a stickied comment - do you want this taken down until you post it?
---
OP was asking if you could still get MB from the Nightfall *to use in PvP* for the Mountaintop quest.
---
Shaxx is love, Shaxx is life.
---
The Old Blades as the triumph mentions, hopefully we'll see more of those fun quests soon.
---
I didn't say it would be easy lol. I only like crucible when mayhem is active personally.
---
Nice. What weapon you doin next?
---
If you haven't gotten Redrix, try getting a 5 valor streak then do comp for the other quests.
---
I recommend Arbelast because it is now the revelry.
---
You may need to collect it from the triumph (by clicking the triumph in the Gambit section), or 'buy' it from the Drifter.
---
Also, a very good suggestion
---
I WISH they could add in first CURSE. GET IT
---
Get it. Oh redditor mine
---
OK TY 😊😊😊
---
I found if you have your whole team go far away to make the section 'despawn', they *tend* to reappear with the section in the correct position.
---
I think it's a sub emblem for the Playin the Odd emblem, try that.
---
Hey so it is a variant of a different emblem. Pull out the playin the odds emblem, and inspect it. There should be a way to change it to the emblem you want. Lemme know if that works!!
---
It specifies in a single season
---
thanks
---
I’m working on midnight coup with trials of the nine shader. It’s on r/lasrig
---
It takes like a hundred redjacks to kill 1 hive knight lmao. Can’t use shin malphur cause then thats a 2v1. Crucible doesnt count either...
---
i prefer DING. This is why I am with a certain Drifter Zavala
---
And you are free to do so.   
---
Nonetheless, +10% exp are the most useful shells.

---
My understanding is it still works in QP just not competitive.
---
I have reset 3 times this season.
---
I'll have a look. TY
---
It specifies crucible or gambit
---
I can not confirm nor deny this is how us titans spend our spare time
---
Nothing until the annual pass is over
---
And the most funny thing is that they can't do shit with their Not Forgotten or Luna because it requires good aim and skills.
---
Oh damn! That's really nifty!
---
Yes, that's the one that works. TY 😊
---
ay, that's kind of unfortunate. try to finish 3 random comp games before the weekly reset for the bonus glory though. 160 for guardian and brave, 120 for heroic. as long as you win 1 out of 3 for the week you have a net positive gain. and on the road to 2100 every bit counts.
---
Only comp is disabled
---
Comp is full of kids who rely on grenade spam instead of gunplay and good decision making it’s not fun
---
Sorry not familiar with glory. 3 games per week gains extra glory?
---
Except I did, he says “the triumphs not
---
Complete-able because they disabled gambit” my response is that the triumph is for gambit and crucible
---
I love Chaos Reach, it's just fun to do. And watch for that matter.
---
Can confirm you get the ornaments from the packages Eva sells
---
5'8'' is enormous! Awesome job dude!
---
You have to use Acrius to do the catalyst xD
---
Not using Acrius only works on the quest. Not the catalyst itself
---
It's a shame the weapons dont get the year 2 treatment.
---
So after reading that, I believe I understand, but I still have a few questions. (Sorry for being so confused) so I have the invader head bounty, but I’m unsure if it’s 1,2 or 3. I believe it is 3, because I recall getting a few invader helmets. But I do know that I DO NOT have +1 and +2 for reaper IN MY INVENTORY. I remember that I dismantled them. Is it necessary that both be in my inventory? Also, I definitely know that I have previously completed the +2 Reaper helmet bounty. Is doing the method your explaining necessary, or could I just wait until tomorrow to get the +3 Reaper Bounty?
---
Probably easier than ever now with the revelry, and revelric light making more orbs
---
thanks!
---
I'll probably get down voted but I'll speak from personal experience about why I might pay about 100 dollars to get to legend and NF. 
---
I'm currently at 4704 glory. I've gotten to 5100 and was 4900 before this revelry shit started. I've put in a ton of time into comp, rumble, private matches, reviewing my game play, etc to get good enough to reach legend. I've grinded, I've grown and gotten better, and I've mostly enjoyed but it's getting exhausting and I just want the carrot at the end of the stick. The thought of not getting there is demoralizing and currently it feels much more random with the Revelry fuckery. I'm tired of sitting in orbit for God knows how long just to queue into the sweatiest, laggiest matches where even if you win more than you lose you can still lose glory. 
---
Outside of Destiny, I work at least 50 hours a week and have a 10 month old daughter. The time I spend playing I want to enjoy because it is limited. If paying $100 of my disposable income for a recovery gets me that carrot and allows me to play comp stress free again, it may just be worth it and I'll feel no shame at all. 
---
Just my thoughts. Take what you want from it.
---
What does blueberry mean?
---
If you laugh and shat a brick, there's more here: twitch.tv/afiqkwipo
---
You're welcome! Good luck on the rest of the quest!
---
I knew I’ve seen this somewhere before
---
I meant to say I completed thorn already. Just trying to find the allegiant guest. Wasn't sure if its triggered after thorn.
---
Fair enough
---
Try dark mode
---
Shouldn’t. Steaks are kept in the same season.
---
Ok sorry I did not know that
---
There are several y1 slug shotguns, I believe the IB one, if you got it is a good roll, along with the new monarchy one.
---
They clearly specified the size on site
---
they are not small...he lives in Canada where they drink Maple Syrup all day...that is a gallon "pocket" not a tiny "packet" like in the US.  - side note - when I first saw the pic I thought it was some spicy Ramen thing for Cayde.
---
Lemme rephrase "Where's all the Y2 slug shotguns"
---
Legal issues with life size replicas being able to be modified into working firearms.
---
What is that blue red hand cannon? Looks very steady.
---
Yes, but you would probably lose more than you gain in that scenario. Basically, you’d lose points for each match that you lost, but then get 120 points at the weekly reset.

This has been happening a lot lately. It's also been happening with The Drifter. I think it's happened with Eva too.
---
Happens when you use supers that can push enemies around. The biggest offender is sentinel shield spam. Just be careful to have your back to the ledge when fighting the servitor and you should be fine.
---
Literally unplayable. 😂
---
I can’t even imagine the weight of that... DO IT!
---
What do you mean!
---
Ive had that before but like a down to wire type. Not on a blowout wtf lol
---
Leave it to a bunch a dum dum titans to toss their ball out into the street
---
But for real though, this literally just happened to my fireteam.
---
Yes, as of right now, when the event is over you'll lose your ornaments.
---
No they do not care, no.
---
When you bring your mate on his first raid and he gets 1k before you
---
Yes. The price also requires that you already have Luna's.
---
I'm a professional developer, and this is honestly driving me nuts.  Not because I doubt what they're saying, but because there HAS to be a truly fascinating reason behind it.  If this came up on software I as working on, I would keep digging until I understood what the cause was, and \*why\* that's acceptable. (Understanding that "we just don't care" is a valid reason) 
---
In my experience, anything that should be simple and isn't is either tied closely to some unorthodox but desirable functionality, or is a red flag for an underlying design problem.
---
If its the latter, then that's Bungie's problem, and its likely that the cost to fix the underlying problem isn't worth it for vanity crap. ...which isn't something you can put in a news post if you're trying to garner good PR.
---
If its the former, than the technical explanation is probably legitimately complicated, and therefore also something that can't be explained in a news post.
---
....that said, if they REALLY want to be transparent, they should TRY for the love of god to give us a vague explanation. ...otherwise people are left to speculate that the real reason is that they just don't care.
---
I LFGed with two guys running that last night.  They were out-killing my Shinobu Grenades.

What was your reference material?

How would that reduce RNG? It’s still random as to what you get initially
