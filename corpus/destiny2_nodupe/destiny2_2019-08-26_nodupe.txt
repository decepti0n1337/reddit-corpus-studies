I have like 8k crucible tokens
---
---
---
Ah yes, that’s was the coolest thing in raise of iron
---
OOF
---
If you can hit snipe shots, you should be invading more haha
---
Man, the primevil was such a wingman, he believed in you and gave you the little boost you needed for that team wipe.
---
Hope bubbles make us useful again
---
Nice
---
Niiice
---
Hammerhead is the best scout rifle in the game. It just happens to be belt fed and full auto.
---
FORSAKEN only comes in a bundle now. Just get the Forsaken complete edition which comes with the annual pass as well
---
Gatekeeping at its finest.
---
I wish I had jotun
---
When you calculate your costs of havoc and kill the panic titan and destroy the enemy team.... it is great
---
Till Sept 30th
---
As far as I know it lasts 8 days. Checked on my xbox in the xbox store and assume it's the same time as the battle.net sale
---
Thank you!
---
I just saw his name for the first time as well, that's amazing
---
Still in survival you can have the clutch last guardian standing rush and wiping the other team
---
Toil and Trouble with Full Auto + Assault mag is dope. I just want one that doesn't have outlaw because it's no good on a shotgun
---
Everyone gets lucky every now and then.
---
You say that like blade barrage isn't way better than nova bomb in almost every single way.
---
From the post:
---

---
&gt; and the complete edition wasn't in the store.
---
I don't have an xbox, so I am not sure if it's not in a very obvious spot, or if it's actually not on the store.
---
*misses*
---
Drifter pulling some strings from the shadows!
---
Vrag is the other cabal that spawns in the world.
---
1st of all, when your blueberries get farmed that means super energy to you enemies, which then leads to more supers from orbs of light, which then leads to heavy control, which leads to even more supers and heavy. I'm not catering to blueberries, I just dont want to see 17 supers in a single game.
---
 2nd, i don't want double primaries back, i just dont like it when mindless apes hold the w key and get rewarded for it.
---
3rd, when there is that many outliers, are they even outliers anymore? All primerary archetypes are not good except handcannons.
---
4th, everysinge weapon you mentioned, not only is a handcannon, but is also a 150rpm handcannon (TLW is a 150 that is pumped up to 225 by the fan fire perk) so you're point about 140 making 110 useless by being more forgiving and having a faster ttk, yeah, that's the exact same situation here with 150 and 140 rpm handcannons.
---
5th, remember bows, sidearms, amd every primary weapon that isn't a handcannon? Those aren't viable in the meta at all, you can't use them in high level comp, so of anything, the handcannons are the outliers by being good while all the other primaries are bad, not the other way arround.
---
6th, yeah, ofcourse all 17 people that play competitive, that playlist sure has a lot of presence.
---
7th I'm not exaggerating when I say some people use shotguns as their primaries, I've seen people ape on maps like equinox, they just dont put their shotguns away. Running down the longest line of sight in the map, still has his shotgun out. This is the type of players I hate
---
I don't have any issues with buying the complete edition but, as I said unfortunately the complete edition isn't showing up in my store. Meaning I'm not able to buy it
---

Check the link
---
I do like scout rifles!
---
You’re being modest. It was a good snipe 😄. I just think you have the skill to invade more if you wanted to
---
The tusks could be hidden away in the white part of the collar. Would be bad if they go into a gunfight and just snap off.
---
Yes..and it was buetiful
---
Can I introduce you to the darci cult friendo? Best sniper in the game. Wanna kill supers? You got it. Want a ridiculously large critbox and an extremely short zoom scope with a generous field of view? You got it. Want to melt bosses after you're done teamwiping? Wait for that perk and you freakin got it
---
The nightfall changes every week on the reset. Until Hallowed lair is the nightfall you cant get it.
---
It rotates our every week man, there’s 3 nightfalls a week. You just missed it.
---
Which is why I chose Vanguard.
---
Like they need to make it either easier to dodge like jotunn, or only give it two shots in a clip. I love invading, but truth makes it so anyone can invade.
---
It's a great gun that has been largely unchanged from late y1. People will come back to it once they get the catalyst
---
I'll admit I'm not great with snipers but I've been practicing. I have the Darci catalyst that I've been working on so maybe on day! Haha
---
Roadhouse
---
Hey mate, nothing special Max in-game setting on a PG279Q 1440p monitor. Wonder if a recording with shadowplay issue??
---
what's with the downvotes?
---
I do like my snipes, don’t have twilight oath though. Thanks for the recommendations.
---
Where abouts?
---
ah ok yep def that then, shadowplay defaults to 1280(?)p so that caused it, ty for the info!
---
Happened to me before. Always a nice surprise
---
In his opinion, what’s the easiest or most difficult strike to run?
---
The true mountaintop is the 4 points from fabled I'm missing
---
It should be 1 round and the shot should be way slower since it tracks the the target
---
r/fireteams
---
What about improving aim? Any tips on that?
---
God this reminded of a match where i held c all by myself botforgottens are fun
---
Loved how you got kicked in forcing you to invade lol.
---
Theres the door, now take ur upmote and get out
---
Because titans dont need skill so they have to make it easy to use. Titans have no brain thats why they are so strong and easy to use.
---
Anyone else notice the building with a giant crater in front it at the 40 second mark.
---
I remember me and my step-dad climbing the mountain together to get the thing on top (idk remember what it was for) I was about 12 at the time and just played the game to shoot enemies and play with my uncle and step-dad. When I got to the top I just took a moment to reflect on the climb, not just the climb up this mountain, but my climb through destiny and my climbing i still had to conquer. The view was amazing and it was one of my best moments in gaming.
---
At least it's duoable without too much effort
---

how is this a loot/ achievement post? It's glimmer.

Well, acantha-d is actually the arc 150.
---
Great clip but what is that sniper I love how the scope looks.
---
Omg, the frustration and the happiness at the same time
---
Yeah at least the EDZ forges aren’t too bad
---
Zayala
---
pretty good for an accidental invasion
---
Yo if you really need a third I’m usually on in the afternoons and all night mon/tues
---
You get one from max blind well and one from the first boss in last wish
---
Fr? I better do it then
---
Done both, definitely prefer the gun lol
---
I remember the first and not the last time I microwaved an egg. Microwaved the egg, was too hot, used knife to open. Burned my fucking face. Plus had some in my eye. A true Mad bomber.
---
I remember I nearly jumped to spot.
---
I overjumped it, fell to the temple and cried.
---
Long Shadow, it's the vanguard kinetic sniper
---
Oh yeah, you and your teammate both have to have the quest and if I remember right it's literally just 3 patrols, a few crucible games and a nightfall strike. It used to have to be a NF with 5 minutes left but not anymore.
---
If you have access to Whisper Heroic, it can be done there as well.
---
You mean only true RoI players will remember.
---
I'm telling you the reasons behind the numbers, just because something is used a lot doesn't mean it's broken. I do want you to believe other weapons are viable because they are, you saying they're not is because you haven't seen them in a competitive setting, while I have, they are viable however even if you refuse to believe so. I can provide you with evidence, Cammycakes said in a video if he wanted to win a tournament he'd use Hush or Polaris Lance and is constantly advocating the Antiope-D because they're good.
---
https://youtu.be/-BhPmXXiRuo?t=344
---
He even got Fighting Lion banned in tourneys because it's effective and he's good with it. J3z constantly complains about Pulse Rifles because they are indeed insane. 
---
T1Riot was using Austringer/snipe in sweats, 
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/467361528?t=07h12m49s
---
True Vanguard's favorite loadout is a sidearm and a sniper and he slays out with them, Drewsky used Suros+Snipe to get 5500 this season. 
---
https://youtu.be/DkLya-Qz0j0?t=183
---
There are more I'm sure, however I'm not going to find every possible person who uses something other than a shotty. Who said anything about sweating in a casual game mode? I said I played sweats, never said I did it in QP, if you're talking about other people who sweat in QP, they're gonna sweat, so be it, not like you can control that. You also can't control and predict your blueberries, so why be mad about it? Every game has bad/worse players, you can't complain about them getting farmed because that's the nature of any game with PVP.
---
Now that you have it, it is in the rotation of guns you can get
---
Perfectly balanced as all the should be
---
Yeah gotta agree here.
---
Hunters = dps
---
Warlocks = support
---
Titans = punch shit
---
Dude I've been using blink a lot in pve believe it or not and I've died bcuz I went to blink ajd couldn't so I just walk of the edge of something
---
All good. My guys are always down to teach.
---
Well there has to be someway to reacquire it if you delete it since its random roll
---
Wait, what!?
---
That's it, I'm swapping from Gunslinger to Nightstalker full-time
---
loaded questions, my alltime favorite special energy weapon.
---
so relatable lmao
---
Wait like u put an egg that was in it's shell in the microwave?
---
Thanks!
---
Or... Name them Ace. Also, good luck to you both!
---
If you don’t have recluse by now you don’t deserve it.
---
Yeah I definitely think it could use adjustment in pve xD
---
Destiny 2's ~loot~ orb cave.
---
Exotic?
---
O god, i forgot you can do that. This is very good news! This makes my monday morning feel way better! 😄
---
most people in high level comp are boosted so its not much of a difference
---
God, I forgot you can do that! I This lightens u my monday morning! Thx!
---
I have close to 15k crucible tokens that have accumulated and at this point its like why turn them in... im kind of thinking about just deleting them.
---
 Np man.
---
Fun but irritating just like kugane tower
---
it’s not that deep but why are my eyes sweating
---
It wasn’t nerfed in D2 at all except the loss of infinite ammo, which was breaking raids and ridiculous.
---
This is from D1. Rise of Iron DLC
---
That was a flawless invade. All cuz the Primeevil couldn't be bothered to care where it threw you.
---
I wasn't going to buy a console just to play one game. But damn does destiny 1 have infinitely better cosmetics than 2.
---
Realizing you have to split your time between Iceborne and Borderlands anyways
---
Fates cried foul.
---
You’ll need the annual pass for black armoury and the other fun stuff, the free game will give you mars and mercury expansions ...... by my understanding
---
Those dang ol Cabal knocked down my mountain
---
Why am I reading this in failsafe’s voice?
---
I finished my last set on Saturday night. Feels good man
---
Just need a picture of one eyed mask and title it Wrath of the titans
---
Thank you! This is very helpful! Seems there is quite a lot of variation you can get out of the hunter for different situations. Great insight, thank you for taking the time to reply!
---
And Here i am Not liking anything about Gambit but it simply isnt for everyone
---
Very nice!
---
Had that yesterday as well, but had my thresher-loadout and no good invasion weapon. So I got the anti-army-of-one-medal, when I was quickly hunted down by the four-stack we oppposed.
---
I read it, I just disagree to a point. I feel the difference between the two platforms isn't as large as people claim.
---
PvP as well, got it in quickplay
---
 I noticed zero difference in D2 between PC and Xbox
---
Nope, no mod slots required. You can easily hit 7 to 8 resilience. My hunter with 5 super mods has 7 resilince
---
Engrams don't despawn. You're likely mistaking orbs of light/elemental orbs for engrams.
---
Probably stand there waiting for guardians to shoot
---
never seen them disappear, but if they did, check your postmaster! should have some goodies waiting if they actually were engrams. otherwise it might have been big “blocks” of glimmer. also not communal, but they look kind of like blue engrams from far away, and DO in fact fade out if not picked up.
---
No? Should I? And if so how? (New to pc) if you don’t want to type it you can dm me your discord and I’ll talk to you from there.
---
Incorrect.  Damage WITH catalyst was nerfed.  Pretty heavily at that.  My tests in the whisper mission, on solar week at the same level both times showed nearly identical damage from the catalyst, as what the gun was doing without the catalyst 3 weeks prior (I have a whisper in the vault without the catalyst slotted).  Even so, the damage saw a noticable decrease.  I believe it was around the time of the box breathing nerf.
---
Theres a lot more than a hundred titans out there bud. Play with people who dont flip shit. My clan raid group come to consensus on strategies, if you played with us no one would care if you ran melting point. Use the tools they givs you and overcome the challenges laid out before you without whining. Master yourself, guardian. Have fun!!
---
Nope. They will probably toss him in the crucible and kill him over and over an over.
---
Use what you like. If you dont like a weapon dont use it, if you like it, use it
---
With my luck, even if I had that many tokens I'd probably only get like 5 garbage rolled service revolvers lol
---
On paper TLW is the best for PvP, since it 3 taps to the head, 4 taps to the body, and literally fires twice as fast as Ace. Ace is a solid option though, and Thorn is ok. Lumina needs coordination to work well, and Sunshot isn’t the greatest.
---
For PvE I’d say Sunshot or Ace. Sunshot can wipe out tonnes of adds with elemental explosions, and Ace can do that on a smaller scale but with extra damage. Lumina requires Teammates to really be useful. Thorn can have a bottomless magazine if you’re steam rolling adds, but it isn’t the greatest. Don’t use TLW in PvE.
---
I prefer ace over everything but thorn has been growing on me,  PvP wise
---
r/nobodyasked
---
I can’t relate to this at all, maybe Thousand voices in gambit
---
I got the warden's servitor's voice.
---
I lacked a primeval DPS weapon apart from a power one, and Truth is pretty rubbish, finally got mountaintop with Luna for DPS so Truth every gambit match now, and it’s brilliant for invading.
---
Army of One is simple now, anyone can get it too so it’s fair
---
In a way it was sort of a justified method as we weren’t guaranteed a legendary piece of gear from an engram and even then it could be for any class.
---
Yeah remember when warlocks needed two chances to win
---
well aware. i have a crucible set i run that gets me up to 8, but my pve set up with the rolls that match my play style only gets me to 5, 6 if i go without the orpheus. like i said, the gear with the look i like is all mobile, so it’s not as resilient as i’d prefer.
---
How about when you migrated to PC and left all of your console friends that you first met on VoG, but then they switch to PC this summer and it just so happens that they don’t play destiny anymore and call it a “dead game”
---
They play 2k19 and CS:GO now
---
Someone make it happen!
---
Something kinda like that
---
https://youtu.be/Clt5RDHfCvI
---
This is a well known farming area.
---
All those tokens, and it’s probably still not enough to get a perfect service revolver.
---
Between the three, one resets each day, and they alternate
---
Thanks I hate it. Genuinely despise you, have an upvote.
---
I can't time the kills to chain the respawn to save my life, I've tried so many times. lol
---
Underrated gun, just needs 3 more shots in the mag to match other 150s better but otherwise it's fine
---
Damn, D2 has some really good lore, Luna's made me super sad, it was such a good lore piece.
---
i dont understand, could someone explain?
---
Don't you know?
---
Long Shadow, vanguard kinetic weapon. I ran a couple strikes and got 3 of them so there not very rare!
---
Such disrespect.
---
Don't use anything with explosive rounds! It will clutter alot of your precision kills because of the explosive damage that does not count as a precision final blow.
---
Outbreak Perfected
---
Crimson is my recommendation for the Crucible headshots.
---
Granted I used a lot of handcannons and pulses in Crucible at the time so it came naturally, but I got the Ace kills done in just two Rumble games using Crimson.
---
*strafe left*
---
*strafe right*
---
*crouch*
---
*fire once*
---
*jump*
---
Kind of moot if your teammates are trash or the opposing team is exceedingly competent.
---
Or the servers decide they want to randomly drop you or someone on your team from a game.
---
Dont forget petras bounties
---
this the power of requiem
---
Wait, you used the app to transfer the gun, didn't you, you sneaky bugger lol for a split second i thought you actually got the gun doing that XD 
---
That was good, gave me a chuckle lol
---
Damn it you beat me to it lol
---
I used Crimson for that, it fires 3 bullets per shot and is a Hand cannon
---
i know that one hahahha
---
Yeah, I use that as well when I started back in Crucible I was very surprised and stuck with it, Last Word beats over it though including Malfeasance so
---
Which imo was both smart and sneaky lol
---
Hand Cannons: Kindled Orchid, Nation of Beats, Better Devils, Duke Mk. 44, Austringer, Kindled Orchid.
---
!
---
Pulse Rifles: Redrix’s Broadsword, Blast Furnace, Right Side of Wrong/Go Figure, Chattering Bones, Inaugural Adress. 
---
SMGs: The Recluse, Antiope-D, Ikelos_SMG_V1.0.1.
---
Auto Rifle: The Ringing Nail, Ether Doctor, Breakneck.
---
Scout Rifles: Nameless Midnight, No feelings, Oxygen SR3, Mannanan SR4, The Conspirator. 
---
Sidearms: They suck in PvE, but you can do well with any Sidearm as long as you have some degree of skill.
---
Bows: Same as Siderams, except  that they are somewhat good in PvE.
---
These are the best Primaries.
---
Try to grind out something with precision hc targeting. Add a targeting adjuster to both of the hcs you'll be using. If you're a hunter, use tether to slow enemies down so you can line up the shot. This step took me forever too.
---
Another recommendation I saw was to figure out which hc you want to use in crucible, then don't unequip it in pve and focus headshots on ads.
---
Nice, I usually use top tree sentinel, but I love to see a striker going ham
---
Still hate the gun though
---
This doesn't happen, it will still deliver the final blow as a precision kill, I've got over 500 kills on my Trust.
---
Think I might have to take your advice on this one
---
LOL okay lemme just prevent grenades and horseshoes from being a thing past cover and from invaders just point blank blasting, oh lemme also just stop invaders from having wall hacks who can just shoot a rocket in my general location that’s still going to track me and probably blowup 10 feet from me
---
Just as I returned from the invade they had just killed the envoys and we burned out the primeval and got the win!
---
I hear you but Truth is not the issue, heavy ammo is the issue. I get mapped by plenty of heavy, hell 1k Voices only needs to be pointed in your general direction and the world turns to flame, just another example.
---
Like I said, just needs to be removed. It’s a dumb weapon in a game already dominated by heavy weapons in any pvp location
---
1k doesn’t have tracking or grenades and horseshoes
---
For all we know, you did.
---
Don't remember saying it did, just giving another example of not have to hit the target but ending the lives of another guardian and all those around them. Truth is just easier to get. Remove the ammo and Truth is no longer an issue.
---
Hero...
---
If they cant get ace i doubt they have TLW
---
I always forget how tilted people can get in this game. If you break it down, truth is literally only "op" in gambit, and only when invading. it's pretty good in crucible and I've literally only seen it in pve once since it came out. It's not op, it just has a niche that it does very well, like a bunch of other things in this game.
---
I ain't even a warlock and that still hurt
---
Well first of all truth isn't the issue grenades and horseshoes is. Truths tracking has been tested and is BARELY better than normal (so I have seen other tests may change) also after checking out your post history I can tell you use a controller as a ps4 main player I can confirm it's easier to escape from a truth rocket on m+k by killing myself with a grenade launcher b4 it reaches me. I have no idea if you played d1 at all but grenades and horseshoes worked the same as well as truth working the same. No one used it bc fuck you we have lmgs and ghorn. So, truth is not broken, does not need to be removed, however there's never been a reason for any rocket to have 3 shells no even anything with tripod from d1 maybe 2 rockets per reload for truth but that's about it imo.

Where can I find this to farm for the catalyst?
---
I read it in Asher mirs voice. Idk why
---
Don’t worry. He will be 7 soon so that will change 😑
---
Oh man grav-lance with nezeracs sin is freaking bonkers man. I rarely play on my warlock but that is one of my go to loadout if I'm not doing raids.
---
Specifically Artifact’s Edge on Nessus. It is the Cabal drill that people understand and the ship is easy to identify and destroy.
---
PC :) its bad/cant get on pc? Also hows outbreak perfected for pvp?
---
I’m so tired of people posting this thinking it’s a Destiny joke
---
Definitely one of the most underrated pve weapons in the game
---
I actually think it is.. I read a thread that said you had to do 10 games of gambit for solstice armor. Can't wait for that event to end sadly lol
---
To be honest right nowexotics are worse than some legendaries \*cough Mountaintop, Recluse, any legendary grenade launcher with spike grenades cough\*. But I wouldn't waste specifically heavy slot an an exotic.
---
you say, as you kill a teammate and not revive them...
---
Yeah. 
---
Or maybe a system where the winning team gets a bonus or something so people would play more seriously?
---
Bahahahahaha ok pal
---
There’s iron banner this week, if you’re max light that should help a lot.
---
on the bungie website it says sold out
---
Nerf this shit.
---
Will they restock?
---
Titan is an ok option also. The arms exchange is easy and I've had good luck with people not finishing it too fast
---
It’s alright lol
---
Yeah fair point
---
Oh, right, well lol
---
“YOUVE AWOKEN THE HH...CCCCAAYYYDE!!!
---
Used to be the best. Now just one of the best. Still very good.
---
You imbecile
---
Impossible! impossible.
---
Yes you can be fabled and claim it, but you need to play another game of PvP to trigger it. I'm just telling you to avoid some confusion lol.
---
RIP a useful scout rifle...
---
OhOhhhh Sayyyyy can you seeeeeeeeeee?
---
I always get the random teammate that runs in front of me right as i go to tether, especially on the bridge of folly
---
i remember when xur sold it when it first came out.... it was hell back in trials of the nine
---
Ah yeah, I was in the same boat a month or so ago.
---
  
---
Now you're in the current endgame, which would mean running the various raids, completing the various exotic quests for their exotic weapon rewards (Whisper of the Worm, Outbreak Perfected, etc), going after Pinnacle weapons for PvE/PvP/Gambit, grinding various activities for "god roll" weapons (The Menagerie, Reckoning, etc)... The list goes on. Some content is restricted to the Annual Pass which was a set of 4 mini-DLC that released each season until now, but I'm not sure if that was included with your Forsaken bundle or not. Anyway, at this point it's all about the loot, and getting the best/your ideal set of random perks on your weapons and armour to dominate whatever activities you go forth with.
---
Lol that’s how I feel against tickle fingers locks.
---
Y33T
---
Amen. I main Coldheart in the crucible:
---
Can confirm am Warlock
---
Crimson, aim at their body and the third tap will hit the head. Yes it will take a long time. I did it as a newbie in crucible and averaged one precision kill per game.
---
Best advice is to play cautiously and stay behind your teammates.
---
Me to 😂. People don't expect the constant damage and by the time they do my damage is to high 😂
---
Daaaaaark
---
Just fyi the guardians killed with x super is a typo and it works in pve
---
yoooooo
---
sorry to think different, but that will just ruin the experience... I mena, where are your tactics!? your strategy to defeat  X mob/boss? your "hide/safe" spots? there's a lot more than can be done than just get in to a room and press F.  It is cool? yeah! but there's a lot more then that.
---
I have the one with remote connection, never tried it myself but a friend said that it was a good exotic to pair with revoker
---
defeat enemy Guardians in Crucible or Gambit with Arc weapons is what I meant.
---
- someone who only gets kills when they have  heavy and wall hacks
---
Then they’re bad at AFK farming
---
You’re supposed to tank your light level with Hawthorne’s gear so you match with people who are either AFKing or wouldn’t have had hope anyways
---
when you get lu a compare the stats and you will see the only thing holding sunshot back is the high kick animation and the perks
---
I could only hover around 900-1,100 solo-queuing, had to suck it up and use the LFG tool to find a group around the same Glory rank as me. Communication and coordination was the key, and we got to over 2k within a few hours.
---
Go get revenge, yes?
---
No
---
Cowardice
---
NEVER
---
Had to teach him a lesson somehow lol
---
Definitely try different hand cannons. For me personally sunshot just doesnt do that great for me in pvp. But some hand cannons I feel like a god
---
Niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

Okay first of all, Ikelos hand cannon is void.
---
Second of all, you are right about the void kills being thorn quest.
---
Third of all, listing things like this makes you seem like a jerk. Especially when the first correction is wrong.

You can view upcoming bonus infamy and valor weeks in the latest Bungie news post. [Here is a link.](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48088)
---
The void HC kills are for the thorn quest. Ace is 25 precision HC kills.
---
If you can't get a spiked grenade launcher then you can always use whisper of the worm. It's a heavy sniper and even after the nerf it's not a bad option. I use it and I still do tons of damage.
---
 If you're a hunter then I would definitely use bottom tree night stalker with the exotic nighthawk helmet. I use it every raid and it's always amazing. (3shot golden gun turns into a one shot that deals massive damage on the target as long as you get a critical.)
---
Where is this? I still need 750 sun blast kills
---
Well, it was a CLEAN SWEEP after all...
---
Just keep trying out different HC's to see what you like and can do well with. I think I ended up using Trust for that part.
---
I was good with it until i went in with the Warlock. 0 mobility sucks. Then i figured i have a dozen mobility mods. I brought my mobility up to 4 it made all the difference.
---
Damn did I love Variks. Hope we don’t have to put him down in D3
---
I enjoyed it on the Titan, except for the 100 minibosses thing. 
---
Then I realized I had to do the same shit for my Warlock and stopped.
---
More d1 weapons
---
Burned out after 2 lol
---
can you even do damage at 490?
---
And who said titans are useless 
---
In this video you see warlocks are useless
---
It even refunded your bullet. XP
---
That’s next level.
---
Sweet
---
+ Devour
---
Was your second faster than your first??
---
I got mine when I closed out a PvP match with a 10-death streak. It’s the Catalyst dropping that saved my controller from destruction.
---
SMG, shotgun, sniper, handcannon will be your friend in crucible. Set your key bindings and FOV to what you want in setting so it feels comfortable. That's all I can think of at the moment.
---
The datamind has proven to be correct since week 8th of the season. We are currently at week 13th. According to that the mentioned items won't be sold anymore this season. Period. I already mentioned they might be sold at a later time in another season but we need clarification. The fact "you highly doubt" something is not enough for me.
---
The show is amazing. Absolutely love and recommend it.
---
Although it does kinda trip me out aboot the demon gal being obsessed with skeletor.
---
Aww that's actually sweet.. lucky guy you are, mate and trust me you've got a lot to catch up on and you might be kicking yourself when you find out what you missed
---
He's literally only done the main campaign and strikes.
---
Titan Main (started approx 2 months ago) and still haven’t joined the dork side. Synthoceps, rose, grav lance and fire hammer super.
---
I try to bait oems to run through the big barrier, usually leaves them at one tap, then it’s just a matter of being faster than a shotgun lol.
---
If you grind out the solstice armor (you have until reset tomorrow) you will get 750 armor for the legendary set.  You can then forge 2 weapons and do the menagerie for 3 more power gear of your choice.    When don you should be really close to 750.
---
If you do not want to grind out the solstice armor, then you must do the milestones/powerful reward bounties to level up.  Standard drops should be around the same lvl as you buy from collections.  
---
Assuming you have the Complete Collection and are in a Clan:
---
Clan XP
---
20 bounties for Ikora (you will have 15 done if you do the forge bounties for a ballistics log and 8 for Petra's weekly bounty).
---
Daily Powergear- Daily gambit, crucible, strike, and heroic adventure- these rotate reset each day on a 4 day rotation.  Once you have one the activity you have to wait for the rest for that activity to get an additional piece of power gear for doing it again.
---
3 heroic story missions
---
3 strikes using weekly subclass
---
4 Gambit matches (Drifter also has a weekly gambit bounty)
---
4 Gambit Prime (can be done while completing the powerful helmet bounty, also if your synthesizer is fully upgraded (powerful) then you can get a weekly Gambit Prime Bounty also)
---
100% in Reckoning- Requires completion (beating the boss) and can be done while completing the powerful helmet bounty.
---
5 Crucible matches
---
Flash Point
---
Spider Wanted Bounty for powerful gear (bottom row-far right of the wanted bounties)
---
Petra 8 daily bounties
---
Petra weekly story mission
---
Petra weekly Ascendant Challange
---
Petra -turn in Ascendant Challenge Bounty and Gateway of the Worlds Bounty.
---
1st Heroic Blind well completion
---
2 forged weapons of your choice
---
1 power armor piece from the forge for forging 2 gold or silver framed weapons
---
3 power pieces of your choice from Menagerie
---
Shattered Throne every 3rd week offers 3 power rewards.
---
Raids also have multiple power pieces.
---
Choose what you want to do, or try to do it all.  I would save the forge weapons and menagerie until the end since you can pick what you want to get with those activities.  Choosing a piece for your lowest slot each time will give you pretty good jumps at the end of each week.
---
He doesn't really care since he only uses an SGM, Telesto, And a grenade launcher.
---
Activision is like those really strict uncool parents that dont let you do anything
---
Thanks, I figure I do but I'm still excited. I'm thinking of starting a secondary character to join her with up until the stort is done, then switch back to my main and have as much fun as possible.
---
I explained how it was different in previous seasons.
---
Nice! What the hell is the deal with that cloak?? 10 scourge runs, I got the whole set in 2 runs... cloak still eludes me.
---
Little did you all know...That is Cayde. How else does the machine get reunited with his favorite gun over the centuries except by backing up his consciousness inside it.
---
Wishful thinking
---
I mean I don’t see any reason the spelling mistake should detract from the main content 
---
But yeah lol
---
The Baader-Meinhof phenomenon is that feeling of seeing something everywhere
---
Grind was not worth the reward
---
Eyes up.
---
The problem is knockback.  If you’re a warlock and you get knocked 1m off an edge, Glide is just gonna send you to your doom faster.  Hunters and Titans don’t have to deal with that.
---
Can agree, almost caused my team to wipe during puzzle in Last Wish because I had wrong jump equipped
---
You’re welcome. Glad I could help.
---
From the FAQ:
---
&gt;&gt;I have Destiny 2 on Battlenet now. Am I going to lose all my progress or have to rebuy expansions when the game transfers to Steam?
---
&gt;No, and no. This will be a gradual process, as stated in the above Bungie page about Platform transfer, but you will, of course, keep all of your progress and absolutely not have to rebuy anything that you already own.
---
Just because everyone sees Titans as bad guys doesn’t mean that they’re bad, guys. Some of us like to make an honest living over here using Synthoceps and Peregrine Greaves. 
---
OEM wearers give us all a bad rep.
---
10 + runs and I haven't gotten one Tempered Dynamo to drop. Meanwhile my buddy could start a surplus store of them but can't get the Pulse Rifle to drop. Cries in RNG
---
Fair enough bro have fun :D still say you're a lucky dude to find a girl like her never had much luck lol
---
What's this fuzzy picture supposed to mean?
---
Yeah a lot faster since I knew what to expect
---
You will have to get the purple set before 10A PST tomorrow, else you will never be able to get it. The masterworks on the purple stuff can be done after the event ends, however.
---
Better late than never! 🧂 😂
---
He’s right you know.
---
My power level, 666
---
That's the one I see go heroic the least aside from the other ritual. It's way quicker to just nuke the boss instead of freezing it so if theres just one person that only needs a regular public event completion, you need to compete with them to make it heroic.
---
I think my first shattered throne solo run took close to 2 hours.
---
The Ogre encounter seemed to be the most difficult, at least for me.
---
Was gonna put it as truth not 1k, but the beam makes more sense with 1k
---
Imma say this now. I primarily play Titan due to the fact that I like being tanky. I have a 9 resilience armor set and I don’t run striker or shotgun in crucible. I am one of the few decent titans.
---
The Warlock jump is the reason why I main Warlock.
---
That floating around is just a good feeling.
---
If a guardian b lines into the wall it's a titan
---
Correct.
---
Same man, time for Classic WoW
---
No, I don’t think I will...
---
You are far better than I, I think the Ogre part alone took me 2 hours of trial and error. Dul Incaru was about as bad for me, but I think that stems from my idiocy with the knights
---
Dont talk with crayons in your mouth gurdian
---
Yes it was unfun, tho i finished my third week before last....
---
And unlike everyone else, please dont make EAZ a crucible map.... a gambit prime map would be a better use of the space. Tho you would need to close off most of the buildings
---
Should I tell him about my recorded 2.6k+ kills on my masterworked Spiteful Fang?
---
It’s no use pining after things you don’t have.
---
“And remember blueberry, aim at the~”
---
*gets caballed*

I didn’t quite catch that last part, but I assumed it was important

Yeah I did 50 bounties for the class item but ikora had nothing for me. I don’t have forsaken either so don’t think I can access Ada 1 or the drifter stuff. I just started playing this again after being off it for like 2 years so I got booted from the clan I was in. No worries though man, thanks for trying to help
---
“Butt sauce McGee”... that’s a new one
---
It’s not funny to make fun of people based on the class they play. At least I know how to spell guardian.
---
Jeez, I have Liars Handshake, but haven't really bothered farming for One Two Punch.
---
He's never raided so I think there may be others.

I had him open his primes, got 4 zenobia Ds
---
This is coming from a warlock main so can you hunters skip the entire jumping puzzle on eow without stompies.
---
Not all of us wear the crutch mask, sir. Some of us have culture and wear the red-vine arms and decent looking helmets 😤
---
Bad juju took a huge toll so they’re grinding. In gambit they’re probably grinding for the prime weapons.
---
You must get invited to every party.
---
I made him do it, got 4 zenobia ds
---
I see a ton of people complaining about this, F in the chats.
---
I always run Gambit with friends or clanmates. The afk farming still needs to be addressed by bungo (I wish people just wouldn't be shit heads, this shouldn't be a thing in the first place) but until then, maybe find a clan or LFG for Gambit in the mean time?
---
I only use OEM in crucible to get revenge at other titans using OEM
---
Also I don't use bottom tree striker
---
Lol i have mine at 82 when i go to the forge xD
---
Not for him, he enjoys strikes a lot.
---
I’m sorry I’m just trying to not make a toxic community. This game has been destroyed by people shit talking other classes due to how their playstyle is

This is coming from a warlock main so can u hunters skip the entire eow jump puzzle without stompies.

That's exactly what I was looking for thank you so much. Yes please whatever knowledge you can impart on me I will be extremely grateful. Doing crucible for fun atm and getting my ass handed too me.

Wait it has inherent kills buff duration? That isn't an effect of an exotic?

I agree let other guns or meta come forth. Enough with using whisper on every boss.

Omg yes, im goad someone else thought that aswell

Been off work with a broken metatarsal... Don't read notes/high on pain pills.  Did all three first week... Because I thought I only had a week.  RIP. Now I'm just tired of seeing them. Hahaha

I'll give you a hint: the answer is equal to the amount of damage hammer Strike could do if Peregrine greaves worked with one-two punch
---
I’d love to! Dm me your gamer tag, I’m actually gonna be playing most of today after 3pm pacific I’ll see if a friend wants to be the 3rd on our team for the mission itself, you and I can 2 man the quest parts
---
underrated comment
---
Go to Spider.  He has the Glimmer dailys that you can do (8 or ten of them), you can also buy the wanted bounties if you have ghost fragments they are usually pretty quick also.  Petra of course has 5 you can get, Ada has 5 you can get, Zavala has 5 you can get.  The Drifter has 4 reg gambit, 4 gambit prime, and 4 everywhere ones that you can get.  If you picke up Ada, Zavala, and the Drifter everywhere, you can usually do them while doing the planetary ones.
---
Oh LOL yeah those ones sucked.
---
Honestly, everybody said to just do the kill ones but I would just do the ghost scan or compass ones. Super easy. Usually you just drive to a spot, stand or scan, then find another patrol and do it again.Took me maybe an hour to get 25.
---
It's a Mor furniture. Unfortunately I didnt see any Cryptarchs on staff.
---
Thanks. Y1 Destiny 1 player but there’s a ton of new content with Destiny 2 I’ve missed. Everyone has been very friendly with advice.
---
Just recently starting, I had no idea you could trigger public events. I just went ham on everything and looking back I must have been such a nuisance.
---
Ah yeah I’m on Xbox one sorry man
---
Yeah when the tribute hall cane out I was like hell yeah I’m one reset from dredgen anyway and then by the end of August I was at 14450 and literally can’t bring my cursor near gambit anymore lol
---
Thats may be true about sprinting. However if you think contra-verse is that powerful you’re wrong. If a titan with one eyes mask sees you through the wall and isn’t completely ridiculous than they should be able to sprint around a corner shoulder charge and have it lock onto you easily before you can even remember handheld exists. The only time contra-verse can be useful is whenever you’re hiding behind a corner eating or in a very close range sticky situation where some hunter jumps over you and you jump to and you both get slightly turned around and confused. Other than that contra-verse is like mediocre because you cant move while charging your grenade its defensive in every way relying entirely on your opponent to make the wrong move or for you to have some other advantage like your falling on them
---
Check the modifiers. If Iron is on, that may be the problem
---
Outbreak is not top tier anymore, DARCI better
---
DIM... especially if you have a second monitor, laptop or a mobile device.
---
I've played so much Gambit this last week anytime I open my map I click Gambit on accident just from being on auto pilot for 5 days straight.

I looked at the requirements for the green and immediately decided it wasn't worth it, armor 2.0 be damned

Well... Are there any? Asking for a friend
---
Well placed! ...but also WTF how did they not see/ignore that?
---
I’ll gladly whoop some crota ass again
---
I regularly do this to my irl teammates on my warlock using Worldline Zero, Tessaract sends a guardian wayyy farther than hammerstrike haha
---
One might even say... *Osirian.*
---
So the arrow has two purposes. Tethering enemies, and... well it sounds dumb but tethering more enemies.
---
When an enemy is tethered by the arrow, all damage besides Heavy and Super damage are critical regardless of where you’re hitting them. You can be tapping them in the TOES and it’ll be a critical as long as it’s not a heavy weapon or a super.
---
Second, when a group of enemies are tethered, they share damage dealt. If you tether a group of thrall and headshot one, they all take the damage from the headshot.
---
Top tree is the Trapper tree I believe. It’s got one arrow that lasts longer and is considered the best one right now. Bottom tree is for launching up to 3(?) arrows in a row. It’s for like, dps or something, idk, it’s really bad right now.

Contact Bungie. No good to post anything here about it.
---
I just posted it cause I think it's funny, he has already contacted bungie but they haven't contacted him back
---
So hunters and warlock shotguns are ok?
---
Queef gliding
---
mmmmm crayhons
---
Yo you think if I do that emote in the old tower I could get my Vex mythoclast back?
---
I'm a Titan main myself, but I beleive tagt the triple combination of OEM striker and shotgun is just a bit over powered. A titan with two or less of these traits are fine, but all three is what I have a problem with.
---
I'm pretty sure it's Crimson Valor from the Crimson Days event (on the robe at least).
---
Have you tried scratching it?
---
THABK YOU
---
They should give it an option to either provide a damage bonus or overshield and the eyes will switch which one is opened to reflect that.

Hey man are you on xbox or playstation cuz I really need to join a new clan mine is dead

Good luck Grindian
---
Yes it was awful and i hope Bungie stops with that.
---
I really hate grinding in games. I did nothing else in those 4 weeks. Barely had time to finish all 3 sets. It was seriously not fun. I just don't see why we need to complete 10 matches of crucible, gambit and strikes. I just don't see it. It wastes my time.
---
That is actual horse Shit
---
I don't think there will be need for infusion fuel one Shadowkeep drops since all gear is being bumped to a minimum of 750. Unless I am missing some other utility here.
---
Good luck either way
---
Burned out after the first one, leave the game for two weeks and yesterday finished the second.
---
Neat

I might have a couple friends. I'll keep in touch and let ya know

"Yee-Haw" - Shin Malphir. Also congrats
---
We know we’re going back to that location (The Black Garden) but we don’t know anything else. It’s not going to be a copy of the Black Garden raid at all. Just like Earth and Mars, I expect our “going back” to be in very different locations or different enough.
---
https://youtu.be/uzp8z1i5-Hc
---
That should give you a bit of insight.
---
Or rust. The blue tangled shore shaders are neat. Maybe not on solstice armor though.
---
Also, if there are some you don’t like and you can’t get a respawn because you don’t want to do that one, go to orbit and they’ll reset.
---

---
I'm Gambit prime you can only get curated rolls for doing specific things like killing blockers immediately as they spawn, In the reckoning you can get random rolled weapons after beating the boss. Tier 2 and tier 3 have different weapons
---
Talking mad shit for someone in shoulder charging distance
---
Yeah that too. I realized that earlier
---
Happy cake day man and thanks
---
She has a challenge for you to complete 20 bounties from everybody else in a week. Gunsmith bounties, Zavala, Shaxx, Ada, Tess, Sloane, Devrim, etc. Once you’ve completed 20 in a week you go to her and she gives you a Powerful Reward. You may have finished it and claimed it earlier this week without realizing it. Hover over her icon in the map, if it says0/20 or 11/20 or something you can still complete it.
---
I agree he needs shoulder charged once
---
I know. I’ll probably change my mind later, but it’s just been a really long day lmao
---
It's just one subclass (Juggernaut) that's a *little* broken, not the entire Striker tree. IMO, it's a fair trade-off (if the timer was a little shorter) for having zero damage resistance in super unlike Arc staff, spectral blades, or dawnblade. 
---
Hate it when you see a red one in crucible, love it when it's a blueberry in gambit. 
---
Everybody complains about Titans having OEM in PvP but rifts are just fine... you have to prepare and play OEMs the same as Titans have to look out for hunters with shards.
---
Not gonna lie geomag meme beam is hella damage, better with bad juju or risk runner and verity brow
---
Congrats. Ya the last mission got me almost throwing my controller at the tv lol
---
I also severely regret waiting until the last day. This morning I was halfway done with the blue set, now I’m really close, and wish I had just done a lot of it earlier this month
---
Additionally, you can do Tess's bounties as many times as you have notes for, they aren't limited to once per day or week like every other NPC.
---
I sadly don't have the juju, but I've used it with riskrunner and it's nasty, lately I've gone back to sunshot (I know haha) and militia's birthright (blinding grenades) with hammerhead and it's been a great build.
---
The last mission wasn’t that hard but it’s more tedious with all the flicks to take that piece of shit down
---
Titan love weak guardian tears.
---
Hey op what the fuck is this?
---
Biggest thing I ask people who actually think this: What do you think Activision was stopping them from doing? Armor 2.0? They've been moving in that direction since Forsaken. Artifacts? We had those in Destiny 1. About the only thing that Activision might've held them back on was Cross Save since they had a contract with Playstation.
---
I wouldn’t consider it a side quest I’d consider it more in Line with exotics since it gives you 2.0 gear right off rip
---
You wouldn't of enjoyed getting the original Outbreak Prime then.
---
I want to meet this guardian so bad.
---
Right! Just fucking help them out and get on with the match no one gives a Fuck if they died when you didn't! Just revive them!
---
I was rezzed as a titan but I identify as the CRUCIBLE
---
Bold words for someone in shoulder charge distance
---
"hehe titan dumb"
---
(goes to crucible)
---
"boohoo, titans too good!"
---
... i don't get it. are you better then titans or not?
---
Good boi does a meme and shreds the competition
---
I appreciate the doge meme
---
I had to do 400 solar orbs in strikes, 25 patrols on Titan and 100 arc super kills this morning.  You can finish it!!!!!!
---
OK so I definitely did this. I saved all my bounties for the 50 I needed on the blue armor. I also did nightfall for my 2. Crucible, gambit, and all clan activities were done last week :/
---
