Everyone's items spontaneously become 750. That is how it will work.
---
---
---
Shadowkeep doesn't not include a character boost.
---

---
Whwn it releases along with New Light, everyone's characters and every item they own goes to 750 automatically.
---
i was bored i was just looking at radom vid and find this shit
---
Why are you using this sub to specifically target someone and call them an idiot? So childish... and really unrelated
---
Looks to me like targeted advertising, shame shame
---
Alright, reading text can be tough, as you usually read it with a tone based on your mood, so sorry! Sounds good.
---
You have snap shot on it so I would recommend full choke if you ads (which you should) you will map with it.
---
It's so silly. I was taking down a heavy blocker with a teammate today, then two captains showed up and everyone split. They didn't even have any motes to lose if they died!
---
im just like wtf is this
---
The range nerf leaves it mostly unaffected in pve, because you can just walk a little closer to the enemies. I don't know how it fares in pvp, though.
---
Not like it was
---
If you use the release the wolves perk then yes, without the perk it’s still decent.
---
This looks like the scene from avengers infinity war where the guardians of the galaxy are in hyperspace going to where the asgardian ship was destroyed
---
It would be cool to see that as an enemy type with the glowing eyes and maybe thick black smoke surrounding them. I dunno kinda sounds cool to me
---
Have you done it if you don't have done it add me on psn:GODfries14
---
Sick indeed. Too bad Scout Rifles desperately need to be buffed.
---
[Is only game, Why you heff to be mad?](https://youtu.be/xzpndHtdl9A)
---
Yeah lmao
---
I did one NF with 3k score. You’re welcome.
---
Hope this goes well...
---
Well, Bungie said that they will be making less Exotic hand cannon exotic quests, because we already have a ton of them.
---
Here’s hoping
---
I'm glad I can still get the emblem, but I feel bad because I haven't had a chance to play all week and everyone finished this so fast.
---
Am i the only one that wouldn’t touch gambit with a ten foot pole
---
Hold on a sec... WAIT WHAT THE FUCK
---
I know its all included, what I am asking is, will I be able to play it without having to pay for the new Expansion.
---
Like if I wanted to just create a new character and do the base game + Forsaken DLC stuff
---
You hear a scream, turn around and look up
---
When your team is losing by 1 in crucible
---
Nice
---
Man, haven’t gotten an exotic engram in forever.
---
i would kill for an austringer with that range
---
From my experience you won’t notice a huge difference between either. Damage falloff Range on Shotguns is capped but having a higher Range stat can make your gun hit more consistently at Range. The same can be achieved with Full Choke lessening your pellet spread. So they’re interchangeable really, I’d personally say go towards Full Choke because it doesn’t hurt your Handling like Rifled does. Just mess around with both and see what you think works better, and remember, Shotguns are inconsistent by nature.
---
Total fear fills your body
---
Yes as long as you can finish the rest before the end of the season
---
Oh no it’s you again
---
I see what u did there
---
Can confirm, Nova Bomb is bullshit lol
---
I could never forget that eye eye eye
---
Ok so I’m not alone
---
I double see what you did there
---
Cause baby tonight
---
The shriekers tryna wipe our squad again
---
I never understood why people insist upon solo queue comp grinding. It's such a crapshoot.
---
Or at the very least, why people then complain about being a blueberry in a team comp mode.
---
Still need help? I haven't done it since I got it but I'd be glad to help.
---
Go drink vex milk
---
No more shield bash? Or is that suppressed shield bash?
---
can someone explain this to me please
---
Came here to say that exactly. Time for a quintupling of OEM fools
---
Wait ......  HOW
---
Oh shit, never seen that, that's great. 😂😂
---
Shield bash will now disorient *and* suppress
---
Would you say his name is....P(S)ylock?
---
Replace that with a mask and stompees and yeah pretty much
---
What exactly are they getting rid of?
---
this is one of the few posts that have genuinely made me laugh
---
Neat. I'll likely still use trample striker unless it's significantly nerfed, but nice to know they're adding more shutdown options.
---
idk man i rarely walk into a titan with a shotty,its more like a fucking hunter thats allergic to the ground
---
Yes id love some help i can prob hop on and do the first weekly and then wait for reset lol
---
In d1 I went into iron banner as a lvl 2 with friends,they were max light) before they added a minimum requirement. It was fun.
---
They're nerfing lunafaction and rally barricade so they no longer automatically reload weapons. So, because whisper auto reloads, it's probably going to be used again.
---
Ive seen my warlock brothers use mindbenders and im sad. Mostly cus i dont have it
---
I wish I could stop but I just started going for fabeled again because apparently I hate being sane
---
Okay cool, get the game on PC then. The intended way to play it on console is with a controller. There’s not native MKB support for Destiny 2 as far as I know, so using MKB is an unfair advantage. Add onto that the fact that because it’s running through an adapter, it’s registering as a controller and getting controller aim assist, *with* MKB maneuverability, that’s just cheating.
---
I don’t play them because I really don’t want to interact with other people playing. I wish they’d stop tying gear to them, but they won’t.
---
mY aRmOr lOoKs uGlY i dOn't wAnNa pLay

Bless your heart.    
---
    
---
Remember... If you get heated/tilted...  **punch some thrall**
---
It's not nearly impossible. Just requires dedicated play.
---
I actually don't know, off the top of my head.
---
K don't raid, plenty of other things to do
---
Good for you
---
That's an understatement.
---
It's only Earth and Nessus, but do the forge farm.
---
Yeah but at the start of the Shadowkeep content literally everything you own is going to 750 light so don't need to grind it out just wait it out.
---
Had this happen to me in menagerie today, Wardcliff+blueberries=death
---
150 rpm handcannons on console naturally have weird recoil patterns along with a lot of visual recoil
---
Whichever, do you like the drifter or the vanguard more, it doesn’t matter you get the same rewards after completing it
---
I did a nightfall but the corrupted one. Can I still get the emblem?
---
auto-reloading is no longer a thing. so whisper will be viable again
---
Oh my god fabled 2. How do you keep that epen in your pants. And im not saying its as good as mkb im saying it is competitive. Your reading skills are about as good as your game sence.
---
That may be true but it did say it’ll impact the game later that’s why I’m struggling to pick either sides
---
In my opinion the EDZ. Its mystifying to see how humanity fell. The remains of what once was Europe. More so of what it represents as well. Suraya and Devrim are prime examples. They show hope for humanity. That they can rebuild all that was lost. Bring out a new Golden Age.  The farm is evident of that. The farm shows that they can rally together and stand and fight as one. That’s my favorite planet
---
Hi dude
---
r/destinyfasion
---
We’ll defend the city in your absence :). And maybe the raid and the strats will be out for you then too.
---
I'm sorry. But what?
---
I went drifter.
---
I think that it is to our advantage to use powers other than the Light to slay our enemies. Even Malphur has said that Gambit and Gambit Prime is proof that one can weild such forces without being corrupted.
---
Anecdotal, but I've been whiffing or stopping short of people with Shoulder so much lately. My Peregrine Greaves weep.
---
oh no i meant after shadowkeep grind
---
Why can hunters block more than Titans? Doesn't make sense
---
Cayde (the best NPC) is dead and the only cool person left on the vanguard is Shaxx and he doesn't care about story stuff so I went drifter with my main and secondary guardian, vanguard with my third just so I could do it all
---
Np man I found it a few weeks back by accident. Thanks for contributing though
---
Looks awesome! How do I do that?
---
It’s extremely difficult to counter and if anything is completely overpowered without questions. KhackisHD made a video about why he doesn’t use it and he said the game doesn’t even feel like destiny when he uses such broken exotics. Titans have had the upper hand in crucible since D1 and it’s honestly time to change that. How come every titan subclass has a 1 hit melee? How come bottom tree striker lasts twice as long as spectral blades? Supernova can’t run around the map for ages and obliterate any player it sees. Stop denying the fact that titans are overpowered because they really are. And to be honest I wouldn’t mind it the titans abilities if they matched the other classes and gave hunters their shadestep back, or warlocks their self res.
---
I'm going to be a new player with New Light, and was going to wait out until release. I've heard good things about forsaken, though. What would be better (and more cost efficient) - to wait out and see if I wanna buy forsaken, or outright buy it now and get all the passes I'd have to buy otherwise?
---
Umm your whole account??
---
Yeah
---
Go commit shoot 1000 voices right in front of you
---
When the Outbreak mission was fairly new, I was watching Cheese Forever on a live stream going through the mission to get clips for a video. I saw him using Mountaintop to pick off sniper shanks in the 2nd room of ads. It was at that moment I made it my mission to go for Mountaintop. I rarely use any other kinetic weapon in PvE or PvP now. Congrats on helping your wife get Outbreak and on getting Mountaintop!
---
when should I start upgrading the weapons and armor? at end level?
---
You started of by saying that kbm having more precision than controller “is a myth”. Pretty sure that implies that they aren’t superior. Keep trying to walk your dumb statement back
---
I just want more pve precision damage, against yellow bars, it feels like I'm shooting wet napkins.
---
I tried that, it did take a bit, but no luck. For the first time in a long time I am using WiFi, and have never tried to play destiny 2 like this. I think a temp wired connection will be my next step. It should be fine though it's 40 down, 10 up. Thanks for trying to help :)
---
because people watch one cammy video and think they can be crucible gods like him
---
Wow that looks pretty tight
---
Titans definitely have not had the upper hand in the crucible. The supers with range are shorter than others, they are slower, grenades are mostly worse, and there are no builds to be made. 
---
&gt;How come every titan subclass has a 1 hit melee?
---
They don't. It's only if the enemy has low resilience that it's a one shot. I.E. it depends on actual aspects of the game to work. Plus they need to be sprinting. It isn't like warlocks where it does massive damage when camping around corners
---
&gt;How come bottom tree striker lasts twice as long as spectral blades?
---
Bottom tree striker can't go invisible and doesn't move nearly as fast. Plus the hit detection for super attacks when in air is stupid on console
---
&gt;Supernova can’t run around the map for ages and obliterate any player it sees.
---
Yes it can lmao. Why can dawnblade last so long and have great mobility and be ranged?
---
The fact that they are granted an overshield, damage buff, and the ability to track your every move all at the same time gives them every advantage in a fire fight and it's incredibly easy to trigger.
---
nova warp is just a shutdown super now i guess
---
Honest to god I have never seen a fighting lion in Crucible. A few mountain tops here and there but  Jotunn, Telesto and Wizard Rebuke run rampant and I cannot escape them. I HATE them. Especially Jotunn. That one can fuck right off.
---
Jesus christ are you really this dence. What i was saying was a myth is that controllers cant be competitive with mkb. There are pros that use controllers over mkb. And you saying they cant is just ignorant. Go mouth breath somewhere else.
---
That is awesome
---
And the class with one single melee that actually does semi decent damage is the one people think is overpowered...
---
Yep. Time for hunters to jerk themselves off again. It’s that time of the day.
---
How else will the trash know their place?
---
Sometimes. 
---
If you play anything forsaken related, yes. If you play anything pre forsaken, hes lingering around. To be specific, I'm talking about strikes. Also, mark your post as spoiler.
---
I started playing again and have no idea what I'm doing as a Titan haha I just switch guns and if I get a good streak going I stick with it  so far the gun I've had success with seems to be Crimson
---
Sauce?
---
Your boy has boobs
---
You. Don't. Say.
---
I'd keep shooting you constantly during strike 😂
---
Congrats on 1k and a fully masterworked solstice set!
---
Dont come crying to me man, I honestly dont care about that Datto, he definitely has a point on that. But why dont you use a shotgun, lile you surely do, to counter the shoulder charge? Or with the first encounter so that that titan cant enjoy the overshield? Just stop crying man. There is always a way to solve crisol situations.
---
Thank god that they actually nerfed it
---
Cross save works that all your characters are saved across the platforms. If you are on PS4 and buy everything and then you go to PC you’ll only be able to go to places where you have the DLC on that platform.
---
I'm pretty sure burst glide is the fastest jump
---
Play on pc should fix it.
---
Hunters use mindbenders cos unlock titans and warlocks you can't animation cancel the pulling out animation with your jump, so mindbenders is the shotgun of choice cos it's easy to get with quickdraw.
---
Do you want me to help with the game because I’m assuming your new and I could lend you a hand with some exotics and missions and such
---

i remember doing my first last wish raid with this new clan i just joined, oh my god were they nice, they explained every single bit and were alright with me and my friend messing up, this is the reason why i played destiny 2 so much bro, people are so helpful
---
"You've got enough to summon a primeval!"
---
Random with 13 motes:

"I must collect 2 more for 15, I must."
---
Nice shot!
---
What a save!
---
The Mask knows no mercy...
---
I honestly would’ve thought this was off the Bungie site itself. Amazing job!
---
Mine got full choke, opening shot, rampage, and a range masterwork. Not sure which is better honestly. Just depends on the activity.
---
Oh trust me I feel you. I'm trying to get better with a sniper so it's actually a viable option when I play Crucible. But as it stands I can't even really get to Fabled in Competitive let alone amount to much when I *don't* use my Retold Tale. I don't use it as much in Quickplay
---
Never said it was my team.  We teamshoot, or counter-super, but no one should have to save their super just yo counter a FoH.    
---
I'm guessing you're a bottom-tree striker main?  😢
---
Just so you're aware, you're telling me that the smart choice disables me for 8 seconds and the adventurous choice kills me and grants my killer his full hp along with 95 overshield. All that for shooting a guy in a game about shooting guys(and aliens).
---
You guys, this person is obviously an expert at game development. Please sir/madam list your game development experience so to validate your claims of Bungie being lazy and learning nothing...
---
While doing so, please go sit in the NO ONE GIVES A FUCK ABOUT YOUR WHINING corner.
---
The most begginner friendly loadout is ace with a wisbringer, no r&amp;g or farming required, and it forces you to learn positioning, because of the low range of the sg, yet you can duel with full confidence because of the generous range and aa of spades.
---
wish I had the time to just play
---
Proxy is best, but remote deto gives you some control.
---
If you’re asking if you’re account will be locked immediately after linking it to steam until the steam release then no. You will be able to play on battle net up until oct 1st. After that you won’t be able to play on battle net regardless of if you linked or not.
---
Meh who cares we got suppressors dude.
---
Have you ever tried 10 mobility with stomp-ees
---
It’s a learning process, but I recently met a lot of cool guys who just recently switched to PC and they’re having a great time
---
Maybe for PVP it’s noticeably different, but I honestly couldn’t tell that one of them was still using controller 
---
They actually helped me through heroic menagerie.
---
I may not be left handed, but I’m sure you could set up your keybinds in a way that you don’t have to use WASD and maybe use the letters on the right instead
---
Find whatever works for you. And trying doesn’t hurt, since cross save means u can try it whenever you want on PC at no cost
---
Yes but I am talking about warlock jump and that it moves to slow for me
---
Outstanding move
---
well done!
---
Oh so it’s not really like that? Just a glitch?
---
Heavyweight and a singe is pretty good for going quick. If you look up some speed runs you can see what you can skip easily.
---
Sadly yes....wish it was possible to do normally...
---
Facts but I expected like one hate comment and nothing else. I was just letting off steam.
---
Do you know what iframes mean? Because I dont think you know what iframes mean. This isn't dark souls, you dont roll arround and become invincible. Also a super that lasted 2 minutes compared to the super with the current lowest damage reduction in the game? Yeah, spectral is the roaming super with the lowest damage reduction in destiny 2. Blade barrage has been nerfed into oblivion, the tracking is horrendous, and the knife damage is laughable, only the explosion does real damage, by that time you're already dead. Also arc strider? Who complains about arc strider. It is without a doubt the second worst super in the game right after chaos reach. All hunter popular hunter exotics boost their gunplay, mobility, or gives them an incentive to move arround and not camp in corners (dragon's shadow, stomp e55, and frost e55). Meanwhile titans are getting enemies pin point GPS location just because the players on the enemy team where playing the game. You shot a titan, well good luck now they have wall hacks on you, and if they kill you, which thay will, cuz they have wall hacks, they get a free health regin, overshield, and a damage buff. Melee kills on bottom tree striker (which is the second highest instant damage melee right after the shoulder chargers, wow titans have the highest and the second highest damaging one hit melees in the game, what a shocker) they get a range boost on they're melee, a damage buff, and a health regin. And you're saying hunters are mindless? Spoiler alert, hunters are the only class that can't skate, so you have to be more mindful of your positioning as a hunter, they dont have an on demand cover like titans, or a free heal and an over shield like warlocks. They can't cancel their jump, so if you jump you have to fully commit to your jump's height and make sure you dont over shoot you jump while your still on the ground. Golden gun is the only super in the game that doesnt give damage reduction, and it can't even 1 shot other supers.
---
You nerd 
---
Jk congrats
---
So um, should they buff the aeon faction exotics to be the most overpowered gear in the game?
---
I homestly don't know why we can't bring him back. He's an exo, and his head was intact so his memories and all are probably still there, and om top of that, a large portion of the current guardians came from already-dead people in the Old Russian cosmodrome, right?
---
The only thing I hate about warlock jumps is that if you miss your jump or anything else you screwed. There’s no recovering from a missed warlock jump. Btw, I’m a hunter main so I know about saving a jump
---
Fortunately Worldline Zero is one of the easier exotics to get
---
That’s Bergusia Forge, not Goffanon. Goffanon is on Nessus.
---
If Brick played Destiny
---
Congrations
---
The psion wears it better tbh

I am open to suggestions one what to draw next ✌️

You think using recluse which is broken in pvp according not just me but almost every single Destiny youtuber btw. Plus you have only a 1.4 KDA not KD but nice try there buddy. Dude stop getting on your high horse bud, you know damn well that women who play destiny specifically pvp are not the best. I want to try finding me more then 1 women who amazing at pvp. Back to your stats specifically 1 you are a recluse player, 2. You are a hunter main which is the most basic and easiest class to use in the game so that automatically makes you less skilled then other class mains. Try being on the top of the leader board in every game but using Sturm and a sniper...... play a game with that combo and see how "not hot trash you are" How is it sexist to say that the women who I play with have better stats then you? So pathetic to see you trying to defend a 1.4KDA plus using recluse
---
Yes.
---
Hunters have had it since the game was released. I don't see why it's a problem now
---
Hunter main here, it’s accurate
---
Yea I’ve gotten a couple where I finish em off after running out of ammo, but otherwise it’s faster to just continue shooting them rather than try to switch to a knife to finish em.
---
ITT: People who don't main Warlocks complaining about Warlock jump.
---
You could work on unlocking as many of the exotic quests as possible.  That's after you've finished the main story lines that are available.

Every time I log on I think I don't have much to do, then I look at my pursuit log.

This post is a shit storm. I do like the new changes but all these "op guns" you can in theory get yourself. It's called the COMPETATIVE playlist. Every season/competative game has a meta and people use them to be competative. There are alternative options that if you're capable can compete. Im by no means an unbroken level player but most every season my comp loadout has been a lightweight pulse and a fusion or sidearm ect. If you cant compete now, shadowkeep changes won't change that. Youll just have more chance of crawling up the ranks fue to the new glory system. It will not be fun.
---
Liars Handshake. It’s hunter exotic
---
it would be weird if they joined my fireteam, when i clearly stated 10+ clears to join. there are people that teach raids, so don't waste time of people that are looking for  kwtd players.
---
If you're on ps4, it might not have enough space on your drive
---
Look how they Massacred my boy
---
What? Warlocks have the best jump. Also, rebind your melee key so you don't accidentally throw the knife, I have mine on mouse 4.
---
It’s only getting harder as you wait. At the end of each season more and more acc carries are done and therefore your chance of loosing just gets higher.
---
Rip
---
I thought you meant top tree because you said shoulder charge, but I’m guessing your a salty spectral blades who doesn’t care to know the difference
---
It really bothers me that the piece of crap Hard Truths is in the Menagerie loot pool, but Retold Tale isn't.
---
Helping each other accomplish things they normally can’t is the greatest thing you can do in a video game.

HoM on the solstice armor with solar flair is very noice!
---
I like the message ya get for leaving a game. "Quitting early ruins the experience for other players". Well so does being a dumbass. Everyones trying to get to 15 and dying as well as not killing any of the taken getting dropped by the other team.

Pretty good paint job, just a little rusty because cardboard is not the most stable material.

Wasnt it The Brays that created Exos? I heard a bit about that while exploring in the Facility
---
Bro are you on crack? This my main account and and I think it’s stupid that even though I’m right in every way possible I still get downvoted because the destiny subreddit is full of man-children that suck at the game and most definitely find normie memes funny.
---
I like this a lot mate the Warmind makes some sense due to the Bray's involvement with the creation of Exos

For kinderguardians ? Yes. For us vets ? Yes

The four seasons are additional content that will be added every 3-ish months, although as a part of Year 3 some of that seasonal content will disapear after that season to reduce the amount of powerful rewards as the year goes on. 
---
I do believe that if you purchase the standard edition, you get both the Shadowkeep content and the Season of the Undying content. Any additional seasons will need to be payed for as they are released. Whereas the Digital Dulexe edition gives you access to all four seasons as a one time cost.
---
I don't think tou get any bonus pre-order content for Shadowkeep's standard edition, but don't quote me on that.
---
As a warlock main since D1 year 1, I can say that I’ve mastered the warlock jump. And wouldn’t change a thing about it. Xx
---
Ehh, idk if berativley insulting someone over their usage of a non meta weapon, the guy hasn’t made any comments on weapons or supers or anything else being broken, so how is he the man child?

Immediate reward at next reset is an emblem if you have completed a mars nightfall this week. 
---
Menagery rewards are: 
---
Extra weapon drop added to the final chest every Friday, for the rest of the season. 
---
This means after this Friday, menagery chests will drop 2 items. Next Friday it will drop 3. The next will drop 4 and so on. So in the last week of season, each chest will drop slightly less than what you could get during the glitch, except without all the running.
---
Especially when you've got the precision knife lined up but suddenly you stab something that wasn't even in your pov
---
Lots and lots of gunsmith bounties and clan engrams. I actually really enjoyed it. Playing for the bounties encouraged me to experiment with different weapons.
---
As a titan main. Yes. And with the coming buffs to bubble in shadowkeep, you better believe my sweet titan-maining ass is throwing on Worm Gods Caress and will never die with the top tree melee ability
---
Which one is it, i tried looking
---
It is, and Titans are right there with em
---
I personally think the reason I don't like the warlocks jump is because I don't main warlock and I'm so used to the hunter's jump, mostly because if I'm going down let's say falling from an edge, on my Hunter I can save myself while on warlock I just have no hope. But tbh in a normal situation warlock jump is just better, like every time they release a new quest with a jumping puzzle I find it way harder to do on my Hunter than on my warlock. Btw if you use liars handshake that miles long melee won't feel that bad lol, even though I wished they added something to separate melee from knives/smoke

My bad , forgot to say i'd use top tree striker :)

They're not unbeatable, but they're definitely harder to win against. Ability energy is only useful if the ability is powerful. I can objectively say that knowing the exact enemy positions and getting full hp and an overshield for killing them is better than the ability energy or mobility exotics that exist in the game right now. Longer super exotics are very powerful but that gets offset by the low number of time they actually provide benefits.
---
True but i do think they should eitger 1 nerf it a little bit 2 make the quest a little harder not mttop 1.0 hard just a little or 3 just buff the enemys and bosses and buff every other weapon that currently exists to match the pve enemys buff (recluse wouls also get a buff just so it stays top tier but not as big of a buff as the other weapons)
---
I find it a lot more enraging having a full team of people convinced every single match is Clash. You can always tell which players are the type to spontaneously combust irl if they don’t end every match at the top of the scoreboard, lol.
---
Just because you put work into it doesn't make it good or relevant.  If you're going to be a "content creator" you have to learn to deal with criticism.  Why was the video necessary?  There was nothing to show, text was more than enough.  Make videos that show something that needs to be seen
---
There are over 100 keys on a keyboard and most gaming mice have at least five. Just let us bind the two skills separately.
---
They’ll know their place by being matched against people of similar skill instead people who have been playing the game forever
---
It just doesn't make sense to me. Like we're winning by 30, all we need to do is just let it ride out. Instead we trade two points for one and say thank you sir may I not have another.
---
Spoken like a true feeder.
---
you get an emblem if you participate but also even if you didnt participate the menagerie loot adds 1+ reward per run up to 5 per run till the end of the season
---

---
Yeah like I said every time, just remember you are also dealing with a gaming generation that thinks camping is cheating.
---
**PUNCH HIM SO HARD HE EXPLODES**
---
I mean it happens, but naturally I position myself to be able to go into cover asap.
---
You didn't tell me it would cost money
---
In destiny
---
Well...okay?
---
Thats why you use both. As evidenced by all the titans I run into in the crucible.
---
Don’t call me gent.......kid
---
Why would anyone cheese it?

Personally I'm a hunter main, but have been playing warlock a lot recently. TBH it's mostly advised to play all three, since you have a three character slots and then you'll inherently have a main due to human nature. This'll overall make the game easier as you'll be able to grind certain loot easier or be more flexible for your team. I've been finding warlock its of fun (the blink jump is very satisfying once you learn how to use it). TBH, just choose aesthetic or super coolness right now, as the PvE is easy enough it's not really important, so you can pretty much just play to feel cool. All of them you can achieve similar things (until you're building specific builds or trying to do hyper specific plays). They're all fun though. Also, gun play is pretty central, if you want to make a melee build you're given the ability to, but it's never required.
---
Wow ok dick
---
Ew.
---
;,( i cry now
---
It’s almost as if people have different interests and things they like to focus on in their games.
---
Weird. Not everyone thinks like you.
---
You may need to lie down.
---
And other supers can't one shot? Does the super last too long? Absolutley is it as cancerous as way of wraith and Gwinsin before the nerf ?Absolutley. Is any super that lasts too long cancerous ? Yeah of course it is.
---
This man flexing on us whit a child and a metric but load of materials
---
Pd: hope that ur kid comes healthy
---
Name checks out
---
Bleh
---
you'll get it tuesday you've qualified for the emblem no ones got it yet
---
*loads shotgun and hops in ship*
---
Well I don’t have nearly as much problems dealing with warlocks or hunters than I do titans. I get killed by the same super twice and watch them continue to run around with it even though their super should’ve ended by then.
---
This is why I hate playing Gambit
---
Go titan,striker might not be the most fun super but,the top and middle trees are really fun with skullfort,plus with bubble getting weapons of light in shadow keep it will be the perfect time to play titan
---
Lol, just in time.
---
Puts on one eyed mask and fine tunes the one eye
---
*lunacy intensifies*
---
If I got a loot drop for reading the lore I would.  Until then I will just keep doing the pew pew, who knows maybe Bungo will include more lore in the actual game in the future instead of tying it all into pages and pages of reading.  Will never skip cutscenes as you need to try and get all the story that you can, at least we are not at D1 levels for lack of story.
---
What's so special about it?
---
I'm always forgetting how hunter jumps work and get myself killed.
---
Please, proofread your memes before posting.
---
Make it use kinetic ammo?
---
It is a primary weapon
---
Even though we're not sad and can just use other supers now, I feel like it's been the hour of the Titan for past 2 years.
---
They’re bringing back bubble to be useful, so void titan is gonna be more like you’re talking, even with a choice of sentinel or ward of dawn that’s very nice and I think well of radiance should have that too (like either well of dawnblade). Reloading ammo each shot is a new thing on golden gun so it makes a big difference between top and bottom tree (top is multikills bottom is damage). Yes they should add new icons for crucible cuz it’s annoying. I’d also like one of the dawnblade trees to have the self res at the cost of the super, kind of like sacrificing your sentinel roaming super for a bubble but with warlocks.
---
Ummm?
---
You have to wait
---
Got goomba stomped
---
r/phalanxed
---
It’s literally griefing you can get banned for that
---
Nope, I used GIMP 2
---
\#necrophilia at its finest!
---
Just sort it out with bungie, make them nerf titan pushes lol
---
In a different sub I stumbled upon an interesting speculation that says Cayde is Rasputin.
---
fire team looks like it’s about to torture a man with a fishing hook and glasses
---
I think he runs the crucible
---
Arcstrider is so good in just about every way, but... I miss my knife.
---
You will have to buy forsaken if you want to do the story, but you wont have to do it; you can just jump into shadowkeep instead.
---
The giant plant reminds me of that rick moranis movie little shop of horrors!!!
---
ok i just had a dum moment
---
Woah!  Well done!
---
still
---
Sorry our abilities and supers and damage are just better👊🏻😳👋🏼😎
---
is this a personal attack or something?
---
Can we rename the Astocyte Verse and blink combo to Astro Glide?
---
it's just if you get pushed off
---
*you're ded*
---
If you really want to power grind you can do it. You may be able to get them to 750 if you do your main first, transfer your weapons over to your alts and power level on them. Although there are better ways to spend your time in this lull of content. Go for a title, Dredgen or MMXIX, maybe even Wayfarer. Grind out menagerie for some god rolls. Ultimately it's up to you.
---
can i get the files?
---
Bruh look at my flair lmao I wasn't bashing warlocks I was just stating if he was hunter or titan he would've jumped back on
---
2 days ago i did firsttime last wish as the 6th rando. after talking all the way till the second encounter, i found out my mic wasnt even working for some reason and i was talking to myself all along. ive tried to fix it everytime 1 guy explained the encounter but i didnt manage to. 4 of us were doing it for the first time but we only failed at the heart run like 10 times. not bcause i didnt have a mic or because of others failing it but rather because it was bugged af.
---
i communicated with ingame movement and spammed 55555 in chat to let them know the timer and extend it.
---
honestly ive never had so much fun in any videogame ever. we all had fun,shit was hilarious.
---
10/10 would break mic again
---
O you don’t have a flair my bad
---
Ohhhh okay thank you👍
---
Never had a problem with my jump but ok
---
The charge recharges your grenades hella fast and hits multiple targets? And heals you? And will give you super energy if you happen to have hands on perk on it from when xur sold it? Will keep you from wasting special ammo on trash enemies? Duh
---
It says Warlock next to my name for me just like yours says hunter/Warlock
---
This is dope
---
I've seen this before in a school about 45 minutes out.
---
O ok it just started showing for me
---
hahahahahahaha!
---
He has 15, we need 3.   I bank the 3 because fuck him.  He missed his window.
---
oh ok, thanks for the clarification :)
---
October 1st with shadow keep and new light update, ALL destiny 2 players will have ALL of their gear automatically updated to 750 power level. So that side arm you put in the vault 2 years ago and forgot you had? 750 power just like everything else.
---
For new players starting October 1st, the gear they receive will start at 750 power level.
---
From what we can tell, this will happen each upcoming season.
---
r/fireteams or r/destinysherpa
---
Two more things: what game mode should I do it in and what subclass/tree should I use (hunter)
---
Thank you!
---
A lot of high schools do this
---
I really hope uldren becomes the vanguard
---
Sure
---
Keep up the good work man, very good work!
---
I'm pretty sure that's only on burst glide. I use strafe glide...
---
Titan: Vengeful 0:07
---
........So, do you have designated parking spaces, or are you just able to paint/decorate a random parking space when you're a senior?
---
Will I still need to buy all of the previous dlc or do I just buy this new dlc then and have the rest of the game?
---
When you're intending to fall anyways xD
---
Again I said I personally prefer strafe glide and use all the time
---
I’m confused what does warming have to do with Cayde
