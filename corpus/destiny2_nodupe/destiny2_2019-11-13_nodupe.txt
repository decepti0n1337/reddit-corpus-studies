guess sleeper is in the energy slot, gg

Ok woomer

For sure, I'm actually somewhat new myself!
---

---
So you can put mods on your armor, and some of the mods just give you flat stats. The stats are
---
Strength (reduced cooldown on melee ability)
---
Intelligence (reduced cooldown on super)
---
Discipline (reduced cooldown on grenade)
---
Recovery (amount of time it takes for your hp to start regening naturally)
---
Resilience (max hp)
---
Mobility (exactly what it sounds like)
---
when I say "run max disc mods" I mean put a mod that gives you extra Discipline (reduced grenade CD) on each armor slot that you can.
---
Demolitionist is a perk that you can randomly get on certain weapons that makes it so whenever you get a kill with the weapon that has the perk, your grenade cooldown is reduced. 
---
To correct my previous comment, you can't get Recluse with demolitionist. However, there is a void sub machine gun that you can get from the Moon called "EVERY WAKING MOMENT" that is void and also can roll demonstrationist, so that would be good for this build too
---
"Excellent point-missing, Guardians!! Now get back to the crucible and use grenades!"
---
Go to Eva in the tower, buy the new consumable, and use it while in the Haunted Forest.
---
4 whole runs of vex offensive including the boss without dying.
---
Where you and your friend the same light level? If for example he was pulling an old bow from his vault that was 750 or something but his average light was still much higher than yours we would still do more damage with his bow. Damage with your weapons is based on your average light level, not the weapons light level.
---
I have the Gambit SMG. Forget it's name. Not sure if I love or hate it. Threat detector is amazing with enhanced SMG loader, but the range is dispicable.
---
Lawl
---
Okay Soomer
---
Reaching to 2100 is quite a grind, reaching to 5500 is like pretty fucking hard and time consuming knowing your getting 20 points a game last time I checked. Ok I can agree that pinnacles are easy to get but they are extremely time consuming. Unlike exotics, everything is luck based, you get those when you just normally play the game, you can‚Äôt aim for exotics because it a drop.
---
Cool name...but too late...5 years too late
---
ur welcome, i often see xbox players there tool
---
Thats great
---
If ur on Xbox add me ianblankg I still need to get em. What‚Äôs the benefit on the armor? Like perks in gambit?
---
As a Chronicler I‚Äôm gonna need to know where you got these books so I can purchase them
---
Your best shot at that perk with a decently good farm source would be the moon shotgun which you just need to get the essence and farm the weapon.
---
How did you not realize that those dudes are called "cursed thrall" or "thrall exploder" you must be a dweeb
---
Ok boomer
---
i got to fabled in 1 and a half hour and to legend in 4 hours. its a joke and peolle playing comp this season are trash. i did not even lose a single game cause the people were that bad, it was matchmaking taking time.
---
Randy's eye socket destroyer
---
I was going to mention that one. Clean Getaway or something like that. I love it, but on Console it's just lackluster due to all the recoil... The Threat Detector and Surrounded is excellent in PvE, though!
---
should i just discard most of my armor and weapons then? cause they are all 750
---
Aye now get that mida catalyst
---
Glad you found someone non-toxic! Just a tip, when looking on an LFG site, look for terms like "adults only" "be chill" "don't rage". Those groups usually tend to be good at the game (IMO) and end up being the most fun. They also usually won't tolerate yelling cussing others out. Whenever I make a post, I straight up tell people if they start being toxic I'll kick them. Tends to weed out the assholes for the most part.
---
Honestly, exit strategy is my favorite smg right now. It‚Äôs def the best legendary kinetic option and very easy to get full damage with one melee kill. I try to avoid using recluse at all costs anymore.
---
Yeah I wanna be able to use the perks. And sorry I'm on PSN... :(
---
You can use teleport gun in UT to teleport into your enemy
---
Ok let‚Äôs clear this shit up, who the fuck wants a gun that they grind for and the reason they are trying to get the gun is because it different. Lmao this is a joke
---
These posts where people have little to no glimmer make me feel like I'm playing the game wrong. I damn near always have max glimmer. Makes me wonder what I'm missing that I should be using glimmer for.
---
That cost you‚Äôre seeing on screen is the cost to purchase it from collections if you already acquired the exotic. It tells you how to get that exotic for the first time right there as ‚Äúsource‚Äù.
---
Lord Salmon will be back next month
---
That entirely depends on how it's coded. Destiny uses a hybrid p2p+server model, which likely means there are some values that are authoritative to the client.
---
Gotta keep in mind that it's not just things like shards, etc that you can edit with CheatEngine; you can edit literally anything, if you can find it and understand how the data is stored. You can change ammo counts, damage events, player and AI position data.
---
For example, you could imagine a design where kill/death is validated by the server, but ability energy is on a simple client-side timer. Change the energy value on your local client, use an ability you're not supposed to have charged yet, and the damage goes through.
---
yes it is, it is a big joke, but do you want to know something? some of the pinnacles are good, like recluse. its shit easy to get, but its like one of the best guns. they are not supposed to be good, different. why is it that hard for you to grasp that consept? only cause your bad at the game and has to spend a long time getting them does not mean its like that for everybody. also im going to sleep so im not gonna respond.

Yes. Using the consumable seems to be the key. It was only just offered starting today.
---
Devourbomb is crayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyp.
---
I got to 3300 points within 2 hours
---
Especially with the artifact in the game giving players who sink more time an even bigger advantage
---
I am pretty sure you have to do it all this season to get the triumph seal.
---
That‚Äôs very true!
---
You‚Äôre right, the shader does work in some places. I honestly just called it the worse for the meme
---
We don‚Äôt like being called that name. We prefer the name thicc-boi. Like sneak-boi and electric ejaculating, magic whirlpool making, big flying purple ballsack havin‚Äô ass -boi
---
Hand cannons are fun. Therefore, high usage is good.
---
Hey you seen pretty new. If you ever need someone to guide you and help you with some missions, I have a couple new characters that I can help progress with you. Pm me if you ever wanna play
---
Doesn‚Äôt change the fact that 
---
&gt;I can‚Äôt get my grenades to do shit
---
I can‚Äôt do it, doesn‚Äôt mean other people can‚Äôt. Also I‚Äôm guessing this was a pulse grenade. As an arc bolt grenade isn‚Äôt capable of killing people unless they‚Äôre already damaged. In which case the mills here (just like all lingering grenades) was due to the other teams stupidity for standing in a pulse grenade, also top and bottom arc super is kinda meh in PvP. I really feel like handheld supernova is the only nonsuper ability that warlocks have that can consistently kill decent players. AFAIK hunters don‚Äôt have any decent nonsupers either. The ‚Äúget ability kills‚Äù bounties might as well be saying ‚Äúplay titan‚Äù
---
Damn vomit fetishists
---
Gracias
---
I forget which one is handlock
---
You also have to have the rose equipped. You don‚Äôt have to use it for the invader kills or even at all but you have to have it equipped.
---
I‚Äôve run a couple of Ordeal nightfalls and got zero! Gambit prime seems to be the best at 2%
---
Mountaintop + Recluse = skill guy is a Chad
---
Ordeal nightfalls do not count towards progress
---
It‚Äôs not easy and not that hard with the right team
---
Source: am 963 titan
---
Tbh they look the least appealing that is just a fact.
---
Double/triple infamy increase the percentage??
---
As a fellow guardian stuck in mythic, I pray you can end the pain and suffering. I believe in you
---
I can imagine it‚Äôs superb
---
You can grind both of them, where does RNG play a part in this?
---
I did!!!
---
Nah the chalklicking playerbase accepts reskins so Bungie doesn't have to make new cool shit.
---
I'm buying some and wearing them every time I play Destiny.
---
Cant blame them if quests like Mountaintop one exists.
---
how so?
---
Also much harder to get xD
---
Yep just good ole rng. Sorry man.
---
All you have to say is Ok Boomer and they die instantly.
---
Boomer is a term for the generation born post-WW2 (mostly 50s and 60s). This generation benefitted a lot from social and economic programmes that helped them get a good foothold in the job and property ladders. The generation have also subsequently voted for and enacted policies to strip away these programmes for the younger generations, and also blamed a lot of issues on Millennials (think the whole avocado toast thing). This has led to a lot of resentment of boomers by Millennials and Gen Z in particular (Gen X too to some extent). The "ok boomer" trend is the latest expression of those feelings and has become pretty viral due to some high-profile uses of it.
---
they will either drop at a slightly higher power level, or drop at their lower values (pre dlc power level)
---
One word.  Perseverance.
---
You got this, Guardian!
---
Just have Xbox and mute the turn on sound
---
Agreed.
---
Alright person born in the last 2019 years
---
Abusers will hate you, but you are right. Now you win melee and euqip a broken weapon to win range fights. Now you are just straight up better, than anyone who isnt using the same things. Higher chance of winning automatically
---
Hopefully last game now..my teammate has 2 hand cannons....not looking good
---
I sincerely thank you for laying this down in layman terms. ‚ÄúOk boomer‚Äù now seems different to me now prior to a few minutes ago.
---
Crotacs?
---
What is "legacy night fall" ? I wanna get that kinetic grenade launcher so badly , but have no idea how to
---
No
---
The last two perks are freaking amazing as well, release that opening shot and have a zen moment.
---
Nothing happened. There was an option to pay glimmer but nothing really seemed to happen when I did this. Now I don't even see his name or the option to talk to him. 
---
I did this champion bounty for the cabal gold guy whatever and offered 1/3 tributes... I have this Imperial Invitation where I have to go to Nessus to recover these communication ciphers. Do I need to go that one first?  
---
Jesus christ I am so fucking confused.
---
Crush my cock with a rock, I must.  Maximum pain, I must endure.
---
Well that's good... I guess
---
All titans? Or just the ones who use OEM cause as a titan I want that thing banished to the pits of Tartarus and replaced with twilight garrison.
---
:‚Äô(
---
Damn I‚Äôm on PS4
---
i cant say anything bc i dont know both sides of the story
---
You missed way to much
---
Hmm problem is I did it almost six months ago. Can‚Äôt remember the exact steps. But do you have the opulence dlc?
---
I mean, anyone who lands the first punch would usually get the kill, that's kinda class agnostic. It's when a hunter/titan and a warlock start punching each other at the same time, warlocks will lose 100% of the time on the sole fact that the melee animation is longer with no benefit at all whatsoever anymore
---
Hell, even if a warlock gets the first punch theres a good chance that you'll just trade instead of getting the kill. It's an outdated class characteristic and it needs to be fixed
---
you.....you, i like you youre a nice man
---
So I hear. But I‚Äôve done some homework so I kinda know about a lot of it
---
r/passiveaggressiveupvote?
---
I CAN‚ÄôT BELIEVE WHAT I AM SEEING!
---
Maybe because of Mara's Twilight Gap
---
I don't main Hand cannons lol. Scouts, Autos, and GLs are what I generally use.
---
Is that proximity nade
---
*Ding*

There's Opulence DLC?

Well, finally someone who appreciate my J√∂tunn skills.
---
This man played crota ^
---
What do you wish O lizard mine
---
ok if all cheese needs to go back to the fridge, let me give you a list.
---
spectral blades, blade barrage, hunter invis, the colony, mountaintop, not forgotten, jotunn, telesto, handheld supernova, stormtrance
---
While i agree that the competitive scene could be extremely fun (I am very much for this), there is a relative high ceiling cap for movement. While ability usage and respawn timers are relatively easy to learn, the difference between a mediocre player and a high tier player can be determined by their ability to use cover, sliding, backward sliding, timing, and engagement. Aim isn't relatively a problem due to aim assists but the ability of  a player to weave in and out of cover is extremely skill dependent. 
---
Bungie focuses mostly on PVE content which I understand keeps players intrigued and coming back. However, having to grind for hours for a weapon or an armour piece (which bungie thinks is whats keeping players interested) is not the case. Much as how d1 created gear and items during its launch which had specific roles and specific drop rates, the uncertainty of grinding creates a long play time but fewer dedicated players. I think WOW utilizes this ideology extremely well. The reason for there being millions of players who play WOW is due to the rewarding experience for long time players and specific loot with specific roles. 
---
If you dont know already, there is a glitch with blue gauntlets where it can give massive stats on Mobility, Resilience, and Recovery. I currently have a blue mantis grasp with 32 mobility, 4 resilience, and 22 recovery. Raid gear and Pve gear are becoming kind've whatever now. I havent felt the need to do GOS to keep up with my fellow guardians, nor interact with specific raids besides what is necessary. While i feel like pvp and pve should be kept relatively separate, the lack of importance in raid gear now makes me sad... I remember when d1 vex raid gear used to be the go to and FATEBRINGER used to be the GO TO hand cannon....
---
now what did you use to make this man mad
---
I got the elemental kills in Forges, has to be the easiest one
---
That's what I though. How unfortunate.
---
Element kills
---
Nice that killed me üòÇ
---
Masterworked items give +2 to every stat, maybe since your bond is masterworked it brings them up with no indication?
---
I lose a lot of points tho for 1 loss! üò± Any tips? I am using the best loadouts possible..
---
I got a demolitionist outlaw roll
---
Lol
---
I mean, Mara Sov is great and all, but have you met my girl Failsafe? And her evil twin, Failsafe?
---
It‚Äôs a niche weapon. It would shred bosses back when auto reloading was a thing if you had 6 people using it, but I would highly advise against using it in current endgame content.
---
Prob no
---
Not playing objectively in the crucible and gambit. ESPECIALLY GAMBIT. 
---
I see lots of new players treating the crucible like COD, Destiny is a pretty tactical game imo and I‚Äôd love to see more new players working together in the crucible and gambit rather than just aimlessly looking for enemies and just taking Ls away from the team.
---
No, the boosts from the season pass track.
---
r/unexpectedwarframe
---
I'll take that one for the team.
---
I'll also take the next 3 please
---
This was a fast meme
---
It‚Äôs a cutscene, it doesn‚Äôt give you a choice. And we aren‚Äôt 100% sure whether it was us or Petra Venj who pulled the trigger.
---
god i want that do bad
---
Be mindful of where you are when on a team, I can't tell you how frustrating it is to wind up putting an izanagi round in a teammates head or bouncing a grenade off them because they jumped in the way at the last second.
---
Looks great!
---
You can do exotic quests now if you want to, its just if you wait until later when youve hit the cap they guarantee easy levels.
---
Being ‚Äúunbroken yourself‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make your opinion on the matter any more or less valid. I‚Äôve used a bow in comp almost exclusively since black armory and Le Monarque came into my life. I solo queue, and I‚Äôve made it beyond fabled every season. It‚Äôs far from a death sentence. You just have to be good with them and know how to use them. Plus, it‚Äôs just more fun than any meta weapon. Running my god roll spare rations, Le Monarque, and enhanced HC dexterity boots is just a great combo in any playlist. Land your arrow, swap to HC super fast due to high handling stat on the 150 rpm HCs and HC dexterity, and finish them off. Only thing the setup has trouble against are good snipers. You have to play them differently and get inside mid range before engaging them. There is absolutely nothing stupid about a loadout that takes skill and practice to master, and can be extremely effective, even in high ranking comp matches. Especially when you‚Äôre teammates play smart with you and help pick off the, instantly one-shot, opponents. The amount of hate mail I get from salty opponents that couldn‚Äôt figure out how to counter my bow is just icing on the cake.
---
Bump
---
Play with 2 terrible players. I made it to Legend without doing this but trust me, it will work. I've been helping a friend get Luna's Howl and he's gotten up to 4000+ off me carrying him. Because of how bad he is, we get matched up against bad players. A lot of the games feel like I could win 1 v 3.
---
i want them to sandwich me
---
i like the 360 before the punch
---
That great feeling when you manage to escape any form of supers....it's great.
---
Yeah I haven‚Äôt done garden yet even though I‚Äôm 960, because I can‚Äôt find a group that is willing to teach or accept beginners to the raid smh.
---
Also, the community can be toxic, don't let it discourage you too much.
---
No they didn't
---
Wayment
---
Keep trying. 
---
I‚Äôm not great at PVP and it took me a few days to get there. I had better luck earlier in the day EST. At night I just couldn‚Äôt win for anything sometimes. Thankfully you don‚Äôt lose a ton of glory when you lose. 
---
To anyone saying it isn‚Äôt hard: You shush. Maybe it isn‚Äôt hard for you, but you need to remember not everyone is as skilled as you and some players are just downright bad. It might be easier than it was to obtain, but that doesn‚Äôt make it easy for some players. I think I‚Äôm better than I was, but at first (definitely in D1) I was terrible. Probably couldn‚Äôt even carry me. When my enemies can think for themselves I no longer feel skilled at Destiny. Lol
---
I‚Äôll tell you that I was grinding comp for a good 6 months before I became good enough to actually make decent progress. It‚Äôs a lot of trial and error, figuring out your play style and learning the maps, what weapons to use and how to counter different players.
---
I finally got fabled right before the end of the last season and I say this as a totally average PvP player who started out as trash. You can do it!
---
Also, I screwed up the title. Ignore the word "made". Is there any way to edit the title?
---
I understand what you are saying thanks for a bit of help
---
I just recently downloaded a text tone of Zavala saying "If you think this armour's impressive, you should see me out of it."
---
Don‚Äôt just fly through public events, make them Heroic.
---
This isn't an LFG sub.

You see a bit of that lake and forested area in the PVP map. I always get distracted and look out at it mid game.
---
Free legendaries pretty much. Spend them all on gift bags and hope you get something good.
---
I mean if crucible was all the game was.
---
"new light who dis" üëå
---
You've hit the rank that accurately represents your skill level and it's okay. To improve you should really try and record your games and review them. Blaming matchmaking and teammates won't get you too legend. Being critical of your own gameplay will.
---
Me and the boys with honed edge X4 when someone invades in gambit.
---
I'm confused why did I get downvoted
---
r/Transmatfiring
---
For it to 1 shot it does. It always has and you can get charge back for a kill with exotic helm. This was only the shoulder charge in the past but bottom tree now can get the full kill instead of 90% due to the mod. Main problem now compared to the past is using shield piercing rounds and ballistic combox2 to get charge back super fast if you lose it. Each class gets something from this season though. Hunters can really take advantage of arc battery and warlocks can use grenades like crazy
---
I got that one the week the Izanagi's quest dropped after I'd already done my weekly bounties for the week, would've been fine if Shattered Throne was available all of the time back then.
---
Thanks!
---
Legend
---
Can‚Äôt be loved by everyone eh
---
Heart hurt

Wtf
---
Can relate

Look at him. He‚Äôs filled with green crayons

No, because you're still using your home internet connection. As someone else said, it would more than likely make it worse.
---
"Wouldn't wanna come between them." - Nobody
---
Oh yeah again 500 Coins
---
For some reason this bounty has been bugged for ages now, it should award u as you through batteries in the forge, instead it awards you as COMPLETE an entire forge and if u fail it doesnt count, that was my bounty back in season of the forge to get izanagi
---
I want that finisher
---
Every thing is fixed. Besides the gun damn that thing is broken.
---
I am sorry for that
---
One very lengthy draw back...
---
He thinks that we don‚Äôt notice that cyan
---
My theory on that is because they're war torn and damaged since presumably they'd be in a big war vs the guardians
---
better use the -2 before they...umm...
---
helooo, i wonder what sniper is that?
---
Thats why we lost the first run for Izanagi
---
What about the scone
---
Also the Leviathan's weekly challenge resets and the order in which encounters are played changes (Calus is always last) from, for example, Baths-Dogs-Gauntlet-Calus to Dogs-Gauntlet-Baths-Calus, keeping in mind those are just examples and not actual orders. You'll have to run the Castellum (The first room with all the doors) each time UNLESS you take the underbelly, which is a maze of passages beneath the map that lead to all the encounters and have loot chests that you likely picked up keys for on completing encounters. As for gear, the same randomized drops will always come from the encounter chests and the loot will never change UNLESS you play the Prestige version which makes small changes to all the encounters to make it more difficult, but also drops a special prestige version of the Leviathan armor set. Hopefully I've been able to answer your questions and then some but if not, let us know!
---
Yeah SOS is similar, but not as rough. Although depending on your team, certain players are better or worse at certain mechanics - i suck at throwing balls, so Rivens mechanics are a bit easier to me :)
---
Ups...my bad....
---
I dunno, felt more like "useless gun"
---
those army of one lines are what I live for
---
exit strategy and randys were easy, it was using mgs in strikes that annoyed me
---
yeah because stormtrance is an easy super just like most of warlocks‚Äô bullshit
---
Yeah the gun was good, but the model was just obnoxious
---
how do you even take a picture like this?
---
I believe it lets you do that so you can have access to the vex offensive. Which isnt exclusive to shadowkeep. Since it's a season of the undying thing as opposed to part of the expansion

---
That's always going to happen though, people are not constant, you can't reliably predict them to perform at a certain level. I did Iron Banner with my Warlock first and tore through the opposing teams because I had a good setup and I can play Warlock well. I then did Iron Banner with my Hunter that I rarely touch and got my ass handed to me (I always forget to dodge until after I died).
---
If I wanna use a rapid fire frame scout I'll use my black scorpion

We'd all do many things to experience Mara's Twilight Gap.

Cool. I got my Monte Carlos by turning in all my bounties at once too. (Shrug)

Sorry teacher

Just kick them and keep looking. Or join a clan with active member that raid alot.
---
I‚Äôve done that way too many times already and I‚Äôve fucked up the d2 tracker login process.
---
What are the drop rates like for the nightfall exclusives these days?  I've just returned to the game and Militia's Birthright would make it much easier to do my mountaintop quest, though back in Forsaken I ran the DFA strike over 90 times one weekend without a drop.  Are they still as poor with the drop rates.
---
I'm well aware it's RNG and you have to get lucky, but back then it was like a 1 in 200 chance of a drop, which is pretty poor odds.  Anyone know if it's any better these days?
---
We have run 4 one xs at home no problems. Good network gear and a good isp.
---
How about touch of malice?
---
That's just Eris having one too many drinks. She gets lonely you know.
---
In Destiny 1 the weapons were so overpowered you could just solo most of the nightfalls xD
---
How about don't be a knob and take a few moments to teach them, you were a newb at one point too and I imagine someone held your had through raids ect
---
Usually it‚Äôs the other way around. Titans analy rape everybody else in the crucible
---
I have a similar issue in a Vex raid on Nessus(?) Where you have to jump through gates. There's one after the fight in that open room, that can send you straight up into the wall and die.
---
Wait are they finally nerfing the OEM?
---
yes i know that but it's only good for move item quicker.
---
As a titan main i dont know this number. Is it much?

You will get it and I got emotional too when I hit 5500 also got the mida catalyst.. I just sat back in my chair and stared at my not forgotten while I sipped on my beer. It was a road that lasted 2 seasons of getting better and better truly a rewarding grind. Hopefully next season we get new rewards for making it to 5500. Good job on your growth this far you will hit max rank soon enough!

Apparently it is Origin Story, which we got as Legendary after mission, but guess it's not a gun anymore lol RIP. 
---
Positive Outlook was sick, too
---
Awesome! Thanks
---
This can get you banned and you‚Äôd lose online access to all your games and possibly more. That being said I‚Äôve never looked super deep into it. I know using a VPN is one way.

If you decide to do this, I‚Äôd be very careful and do your research. You could be risking a lot and not too mention kind of breaking the law I believe.

KAMEHAMEHAMEHAA!

Nope, I agree

Agreed

Ace of spades if you haven't already gotten it, even with the handcannon nerfs it's still a very solid weapon. Chaperone as well if you're ok with slug shotguns. as a hunter you should also go for liar's handshake if you haven't looted it yet, works well in pvp and very well in pve

Ye I better not do that then thanks for warning me

You'd have to do 100 vanguard strikes, 100 crucible matches, 100 gambit matches or 50 gambit prime matches. That's all with the triple progress bonus unlocked from the pass.
---
It's strength is a PvE weapon. There are stronger SMGs for PvP, trust me. When I say stronger, I mean more suited.
---
Thanks. Now i gotta Google how to get them.
---
The other Gay Josh?
---
As a Titan player, it upsets me that he wasn't trying to punch through the fog wall. Be the boosted chimp you were made to be! If it doesn't break, punch it harder!
---
He has a title... wtf
---
The balls on them...
---
No; I dont think I will.
---
I would farm all the powerful gear quests for the week. Once you hit 901 it unlocks some new quests for you to grind out and provides you with upgrades to your current gear. You can quickly max out at 950 gear as a F2P. From there you need to complete pinnacle bounties to slowly grind out light upgrades. If you have the expansion you can also do the raid for upgrades when when you hit about 960 light.
---
All the bounties and quests are trackable which helps a little... but you have to go from planet to planet to see where to go and what area to fly your ship into.
---
look on your director for the weekly challenges and start working on them for powerful engrams
---
Just happened to me in legend nightfall yesterday
---
China is asshole
---
My group made it to the Vault before we agreed to break for the night and attempt it the next day.
---
Long story short, my group most likely finished it, but my lack of sleep bit me in the ass and I spent pretty much all day asleep.
---
If you are like me and really liked the Titan Dreaming City armor, the Menagerie is your friend...
---
Such as? Not doubting, looking for recommendations. I'm currently using Riskrunner in PvP and it feels too PvE oriented.
---
If its because we dont have ohk abilities i can understand. We're nerdes even in pve why would anyone hate us
---
Boomer Sooner!
---
Thanks mate
---
Been wearing pants wrong all my life
---
Thank you everyone will try and get mine...
---
I got that one, abandoned it and next day got another rare bounty to just run 6 forges at max temper
---
I‚Äôve cleared GOS 2 times and I‚Äôve honestly screwed up a total of 4 times on that boss. But in my several attempts I only have 2 clears. So it‚Äôs frustrating to know that I can and I have done the raid but I NEED 15+ CLEARS to join some team. Unless I want to join a learning raid I have no other way of getting clears at the moment.
---
Agree entirely about the raid, the mechanics and overall feel of saving the universe.
---
But am I the only person who doesn't care about Mara? I know she's super important lore wise, but in game she always felt like an afterthought.
---
yeah sure, it‚Äôs not like warlocks have been top tier for a while now and are finally receiving some nerfs
---
You need Forsaken
---
And bungo said, let the netcode carry
---
yeah must have recluse and inzianagi or kick and unninstal !
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
then again wtf am i expecting from a guy called litfam...
---
Can any armor be allowed to have an ornament? Or only high level gear? I don‚Äôt see the option on my 800 level gear
---
I have bought Forsaken already.
---
They should be titans tbh
---
You don't need Shadowkeep to complete that mission. Go to ikora, pick it up and head to the moon. Do a public event, wait about 1 minute for the vex invasion to start, kill everything (including the vex gate lords) the. You can start vex offensive.
---
*sweet home alabama starts quietly playing in background*
---
The rock in the pit
---
Congratulations, you win the award for the most-wrong comment I've ever read!
---
Thats a joke right?
---
Well
---
Then
---
Just fully revert it then, I wanna 3 tap with a 180 again. Lol
---
Can relate.
---
Chimichangas.
---
Thats the last Triumph right?
---
No that will break pvp ttk values
---
Bout gosh darn time, i ordered that pizza over a week ago!
---
Me with blade barrage..
---
Unoriginal and sophomoric 2/10
---
Honestly if I had a nickle for every time I've seen someone named {female character}'s {body part} I'd never have to pay for another expansion again.
---
Get off my lawn! Up hill! Both ways!
---
Excellent demonstration of how effective that grenade is.
---
Try visiting the secret camp in the EDZ. Check YT for the way.
---
No I would. I just want VoG back
---
I think it gives the one you dont have but theres still a bit of RNG
---
I don't get all the OEM hype. Tried it a couple times, didn't like it. I still kick ass with my other armour and weapons XD
---
A man of culture
---
What.
---
Used to be one your missing I think. 
---
Could be changed with New Light, as a lot of things have changed.
---
I feel like I‚Äôm saying it.
---
Or commander titan, giant shield creates like 18 orbs blocking it
---
Have you seen in the Drifter things like quests? The last word quest is a yellow shell I think
---
prob cant get it bc of rng
---
Gotcha. It‚Äôs just bad rng then. All mine this week dropped from vex offensive and public events on the moon.
---
Dude.... you just got moved on. 
---
Time to snitch to the vanguard.
---
Its dumb. If you complain about shit like OeM, be ready to give up your own OP shit.
---
nah bruh thats the yell of the caterpillar
---
what the fuck yes
---
dont tell bungie
---
Oh the vex offensive activity can drop them? How frequent did they drop for you with the activities you did?
---
Ok..
---
First, format your text please.
---
Second, all content is available for everyone, although I get what you mean there are alot of players out there that Glady help out and teach others..
---
Third, literally did Lev prestige yesterday, and 3 times Monday.. If you're on PC I suggest Destiny 2 LFG PC..
---
Thing looked like a fucking dust buster. Patience and time any day
---
Heaven forbid you expect great things from a game you have put in exorbitant amounts of money for expansions and season passes etc.
---
Actual facts
---
Read that in Cayde's voice. 
---
Now sad again.
---
The number of rafters I‚Äôve tethered is too damn high....
---
Wheres the fusions?
---
It takes time, mostly because there‚Äôs no reason to have 30+ at the moment unless you farm clears, but really there‚Äôs not much effort put into doing Garden
---
It technically is on the moon or at least the game considers it that way. I got one yesterday out of 6 activity completions on my Titan. 3 activities for my warlock. I got the last one on one heroic public event on my hunter luckily.
---
Once you buy shadowkeep again it will unlock the season pass again, but your progress should transfer
---
I like that someone who apparently doesn't get how possessive form works thinks they get to teach about language.
---
The recommended power is just there to give an idea of the difficulty level. Nightfalls are usually harder than you expect. Especially nightfall: the ordeal. Hero is one if the harder levels. I would recommend starting at the lower difficulties and going up in difficulties as you get used to it.
---
Maybe you should read my post, because all you need to qualify for KWTD is to watch a walkthrough or 2 on Youtube. Don't get salty if you join a LFG, knowing you do not meet the requirements, and you get kicked(surprisedpikachu.jpg).
---
If you want to get carried through a Raid, make your own Sherpa LFG with your own requirements. Making it another player's problem is the definition of Toxic behaviour.
---
Once you watch the walkthroughs/do the raids you'll know why someone without any of the recommended equipment/weapons, build/synergy AND NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE ENCOUNTERS will simply cause you to fail the Raid over and over. And then you have to deal with people leaving because no one wants to take 5+ attempts on a boss, or they had no idea that a raid would last more than 30 minutes, or they go afk without informing anyone.
---
It isn't elitist to expect people to be raid ready before raiding. There are plenty of resources available to you if you wish to become raid ready. Acting like it's everyone else's fault you don't know the encounter is an excuse for your own laziness.
---
I dont complain about OEM anymore. I dont need to, its not hard to deal with.
---
Cayde inspired us all
---
Lmfao
---
Fuckin Cayde o7
---
Use the mods recommended , elemental weapons that matches enemy shields, void nades with the artifact mod (oppressive darkness), and remember to take it nice and slow.
---
Solo'd it playing freelance survival. Only took a few nights worth of grinding, and I'm definitely a pvp casual.
---
He's not done with destiny. He loves this game. He's just done with being a white Knight advocating for balancing changes. He's taking a different approach. He's gonna use the best, cheesy stuff so that people will take notice
---
#worth
---
Got mine a few days ago.
---
I seldom use it due to it being extremely OP (It takes out the challenge and fun). The exception is if I have a Crucible quest/bounty that requires void kills.
---
Other than that, there are more viable alternatives.
---
#F
---
You won't be able to go to the social spaces, and like the second mission is there

The excess ammount if times this question needs to be answered....

And what exactly did your comment provide to this conversation? A drooling 12 year old could have came up a more insightful comment
---
Wiped on a strike because i turned around to punch whatever killed my teammate only to be faced by 3 cursed thralls...bit I had already hit q
---
I love how every single hunter that does this always take the time to look at the void orb to witness their magnificent work.
---
Interesting. Sounds like lag. Sword knights have never teleported for me.
---
How do you have Purple Icons next to name?
---
Colour Blind Mode?
---
Mine tends to get me killed. &lt;&lt;
---
What about Gwisin Vest. Bungie kept kicking that one while it was down until it was completely unusable in PvE. I actually loved Spectral before that.
---
ü§£
---
Damn i've been doing Ada bounties for 2 weeks straight an still got none :(
---
I'm literally never killed by it in crucible. Maybe it's because I am a hunter so it's pretty easy to avoid with the triple jump.
---
Use the dodge for escaping via corners.
---
As I said before, i dont want to adjust my play style to deal with one class. I'm playing this game for fun, not a million dollar competition.
---
‚ÄúAwwwwwww‚Äù
---
I would have been fine with a damage nerf, but they ddnt have to take awake my 1, 2 knee combo conpletely... * Angry titan noises *
---
There are other hunter exotics besides Liar's?
---
It's just annoying since I literally had it right there. I don't get how there is lag when it's just me.
---
Make sure your Ethernet cable is plugged in.
---
Wow an actual use of Morrowind instead of Skryim
---
take my up"boat" friend!
---
This is a commission and you can‚Äôt use it :( I think it‚Äôs best you ask the person who commissioned it
---
*hunter main who knows that if I jump during Teather, Quiver, or Blade Barrage I could botch the super into a ceiling, wall, or a particle of dust*
---
*Jumps anyways*
---
I‚Äôm a new player - what does this mean
---
Beep boop beep bop. Pictures of just a username you saw in game should go to r/destinyusernames, r/destiny2names, or r/destinynames.
---
Take a sniper along with you and so boss dmg from the distance. And always clear adds first. If u warlock slot the healing Focus it helps the team
---
I know this is a joke and it‚Äôs incredibly frustrating getting your notes stolen, but captain &gt; knight for blockers. And always if you can send over two blockers to start draining the enemy teams bank!
---
I know and im extremely carful so please don't report me ok?
---
Thank you for being a big brain player
---
This drives me nuts every time i think about it like how much time has the "OEM+B.T striker+Mountaintop+Recluse" reigned supreme without a single semblance of a nerf while any other deviation in the other classes get the Hammer.
---
It‚Äôs easy to avoid regardless. Just even easier with hunter.
---
If u have the shadowkeep dlc start with that otherwise u can just Pick up where u left. There are also rememberance questlines where u can play al the previous Story lines
---
The jump is good, but we aren‚Äôt even ‚Äúfast,‚Äù which is the whole point of the mobility, because Titans exist. And even with a decent jump, it was much more effective on console; with PC the advantage it gives is much smaller.
---
  Our enhanced radar is a joke, it‚Äôs literally 1/4 of OEM.
---
  Inivis got nerfed.
---
  Smoke bombs are hilariously hard to utilize and don‚Äôt do much even with a perfect throw.
---
  The grenades aren‚Äôt as good as you think, especially with tripmine‚Äôs changes since D1.
---
I‚Äôm not trying to make an argument that hunters are underpowered, but they certainly aren‚Äôt the god tier PvP class some people think.
---
You‚Äôll find out
---
They‚Äôre the exploding hive enemies, so If you punch them it‚Äôs normally an instant death, but it‚Äôs so damn satisfying
---
To me the issue is that 50% of players in all of my games are bottom tree strikers rocking OEM. Even if hunter's and warlock's have good options, they are nowhere near as abused.
---
VOID &gt; everything else can suck a dick
---
(the hunter doing escalation watching the titan)

üòÆno wait

Oof right in the chops

If you want good team mates so badly go on lfg

If they have wall hacks bait them and use your radar
---
Should of been Skull instead of crown for the warlock. I miss throwing nova bombs for an entire strike.
---
No I was grinding out grenade launcher kills for wendigo. Happened this morning while was using fighting lion.
---
Highest I have is an exotic engram drop 67 stat roll Armamentarium.
---
Legendary highest is 61. 
---
Both pre mods.
---
You'll get your motes when you KILL THE DAMN BLOCKERS! [Door slam]
---
Don‚Äôt worry. The thing is probably gonna get nerfed into the ground and yet another useful exotic will turn into complete shit.
---
I still think it‚Äôs not in a good state because it‚Äôs too easy to use for Titans. It really should be way more risky
---
When im invading, i either get popped with a sniper or blown back to the tower with a grenade launcher. When getting invaded, same thing but we kill each other or hes across the map
---
That wee shield comes with a nerf to damage taken. They can round the corner holding that nade with no concerns.

I hate this jumping stuff so much. That's how I died most the time.

Don‚Äôt forget that hunters can snipe you cross map with their throwing knives. i‚Äôll admit that yeah it‚Äôs a lot harder to do but i‚Äôve been sniper bodied then throwing knifed right in the dick a ton before.

SHIELDY BOIS RIGHT THEY ARE SACKING

JUST PUSH THEM FOR NOW

What makes it easier for titans ? Sorry if dumb question this game is so confusing lol
---
IM solo happy I picked up the quest cause no I can get the gun especially when comp is so easy right now
---
God, I hope no one notices how OP synthoceps are. I love ripping through people with my fists in PvP.
---
Im at 960 power level and finally decided to try the 950 nightfall, i wasn't expecting the difficulty to ramp up like that. We didnt even finish the first part of pyramidion. The mobs were super tanky. Anyone have tips? I appreciate it.
---
Jealousy
---
Well it‚Äôs a Titan exclusive exotic and Titans, while still being in a bit of a bad spot, have a lot of tools with the wall hacks they can use to utterly give you zero options left.
---
i cant believe you‚Äôre a hunter and you‚Äôre saying this
---
Deem them, ‚Äú*noticed.*‚Äù
---
Sure i get that, and im constantly looking at what im doing wrong and improving on my tactics, i just dont get why the other team is always stacked with players who are way better than mine, its freelance, they arent teamed up, but my team is getting slaughtered, im up to 9 loses in a row now, always different enemies, always different teammates.
---
Ok awesome thank you
---
Ok, it doesn‚Äôt say it in the triumph but yeah I‚Äôve heard banner does
---
Oh ok didn‚Äôt know there was class exclusive stuff , I‚Äôm Titan so hopefully I‚Äôll get it
---
The synthesiser can be found in your quests. You'll need synths, which can be obtained through completing bounties from the Drifter or by playing Gambit Prime.
---
PSA: using a finisher on a Cursed Thrall will prevent it from exploding
---
Was Mara Supposed to look like that on purpose during the cut scenes?
---
Erentil is much worse than Mtop. And yet no one complains about it.
---
he‚Äôs saying any build that includes artifact mods.
---
Every god damn time
---
How about the fact they destroyed breakneck when it was starting to get good but they left recluse alone. That shit still pisses me off!
---
I suppose the blockers are subjective because everyone handles them differently. However if my teammates are gonna take the 3 motes i need for a large blocker and die or invade with them, id rather them just let me have em lol.
---
It's not op. every class has something good about it. that's the only thing decent in nova warp tree. the super is literally pointless and has not been nerfed, but rather obliterated. that tree has good neutral game, that's it.
---
titans can fucking one shot melee you in just about any subclass so i dont even want to hear your bitching.
---
Yeah because hunters totally use all those abilities at the same time... bro
---
HH supernova counters shoulder charge/seismic strike/ hammer strike one melee kills all damn game. It‚Äôs literally the only counter. How can a titan complain about a one shot grenade with all these insane melees?
---
i‚Äôm in this video and i don‚Äôt like it
---
If you think my facts were "straight from my ass" then you clearly didn't read what I just said. Just because they changed recently doesn't mean I made them up from nothing. I just said that hunter population has taken a recent dip, but hunter *bitching* has been consistent for over a year. It doesn't change no matter what the popularity of each class is.
---
Sounds like this where I‚Äôm farming my wendigo as well then
---
I don't understand why people are complaining so much about Mountaintop and Recluse? Shadowkeep made getting these weapons even easier to obtain by non comp players. And with the introduction of Momentum Control, getting specific weapon kills has never been easier.
---
I got both of them this season and I'm average at PVP at best. Don't cry about it. Go get it yourself. That's not a "get gud" kind of statement either. Pinnacle weapons are rewarded to those willing to do the grind. They're not bought, unless you're a Luna/ Not Forgotten win trading scumbag. Also, after many hours in the Crucible this season, most OEM users don't know what they're doing and are easily countered and that's coming from a Titan main. I've had a better play experience using Skullfort or Synthocepes. Bottom line,  OEM users are either bad or asshole PVP players.
---
It‚Äôs overused and fucking annoying just like huntfag‚Äôs with shotguns.
---
I‚Äôm slightly above average. I can do it fine. You gotta play smart. Or here‚Äôs an idea play in group. You still won‚Äôt get to 5500 with that attitude but you can stop blaming other people. Maybe you‚Äôll start blaming guns like LW  recluse or OEM.
---
Yikes I got my black armory bounty yesterday and it was the elemental kills , so i got really lucky and managed to pick up my sniper yesterday , good luck with your quest
---
Atheon in the flesh
---
I hear ya...
---
Some people are just trying to do their powerful‚Äôs (or it‚Äôs the shitty MM) it‚Äôs necessarily not the players fault so don‚Äôt get mad at them they did nothing wrong except play the game it‚Äôs something with Bungie rn
---
It all comes down to personal prefereance, but given how much effort it takes to masterwork gear, I don't see my self bothering with anything below 60, 58 at a minimum.
---
Lmao ‚Äúyou suck I can‚Äôt believe you let him shoot you one time and didn‚Äôt kill him immediately‚Äù sounds like you don‚Äôt know how the exotic you‚Äôre defending works either.
---
Because once you put it a lfg, they better queue up just like you said, right? Who's entitled now?
---
And then do what? Watch them heal because it was a Hail Mary knife? Or more likely, Miss? I‚Äôve thrown plenty of knives, if I chuck a random one and *HAPPEN* to get a hit, they just heal back up and nothing else happens
---
If you go to Amanda Holliday in the tower you can play through the old campaigns if you haven't already. There is a HUGE amount of content thrown at you so it would be useful to use a guide like the one linked on r/destinythegame or something.
---
All my IB pinnacle drops were weapons this time around...  
---
=(
---
I snipe personally but I understand your frustration
---
As far as gaining light levels there not much else but pinnacles and the artifact.  You‚Äôre gonna have to find activities you enjoy other than raising your light.  You could add to your collections, do triumphs, try new load outs and play styles, level an alt, get into gambit or PvP, or help lower level players learn and do raids and such
---
You mean Punch-dodge-be-already-dead
---
The amount of setup this build takes to one hit anything makes it more trouble than its worth in pvp. I always end up switching to another subclass if I‚Äôm going to be doing pvp for a while. It is, however, a shit ton of fun in pve and gambit. Melting primevals in gambit prime in one phase is pretty satisfying if you set it up right
---
Or even maybe losing less glory
---
And he even scratched his leg afterwards
---
Some people just don't think crayons are meant to be eaten, so they choose the other two classes.
---
Underrated comment. 
---
They‚Äôve been breaking and rebreaking the game since the launch of D1 because they keep trying to balance both at the same time. 
---
How many great exotics, that felt fun and powerful and, fuck me I know, *exotic* have been hammered into the ground because they were too strong in PVP? 
---
How many weapons and supers? 
---
They have proven they have the ability to both disable level advantages AND change how supers work AND how weapons do damage and yet, they constantly  broadly brush the whole canvas. 
---
It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense.
---
Only keep using it cause I don‚Äôt have any other masterworks that offer the orbs on multi kill. 
---
Tried to infuse it into something else. That was a no go.
---
Foetracer tracks for 2-3 seconds, only tracks if you shoot THEM, and the Danae buff is 1%, starting at 30%. Literally only 900rpm SMGs can functionally use the Damage buff
---
I never said that and it's cute how you're trying to put words in my mouth.
---
If someone wants to go crazy with the requirements they'll find out soon enough that they're not going raiding, all I'm arguing for is that people respect the requirements, and post their own LFG if they don't like it.
---
Nooo the worst one is def the 50 forge charges.
---
The exotic isn't broken, and he definitely didn't instantly get shield and health, that was changed during the 1st nerf that everyone seems to have forgotten about.
---
Every time I do it I think of the ‚Äúfeels good‚Äù meme.
---
Because meta+meta= double annoying
---
That's not time locked tho, plus if you did it with friends, that's literally 2 forges to complete it. If I even know what a forge charge is, I dont really pay attention to names of things in the black forge
---
Keep the mask on when you get to uldren.
---
I just got that, and it makes me so sad. I guess I‚Äôll just be a little closer to platinum starling now.
---
Rally barricade was great too. Was it so good they just had to nerf it? I never thought it was super op but that‚Äôs just me I guess.
---
It may come to some amount of surprise to you but people don't always play Destiny 2 for the PVP especially with matchmaking the way it is. Sometimes you've got to do a few crucible games to get powerful gear that week or do a bounty. Believe me they are probably not having fun, just doing the grind.
---
Thats when the game opens up, you have much more access to content, it is more tedious but there is a lot more to do.
---
I mean I get what you‚Äôre saying because you can 100% be carried thru every activity but like there is no way they can be having any type of fun at all when it comes to pvp anyways , and like an FPS is an FPS no matter what man lol they all play essentially the same at the end of the day (aim and shoot)üòÇüíÄit‚Äôs seriously like some of these people have NEVER played a video game in thier life
---
I need to calibrate a trace rifle for one of Banshee's bounties today. I have played over a 100 hours of Destiny 2, and have never even seen this kind of weapon before. Where do I get one?
---
They just got rid of auto-loading altogether
---
Too bad he didn‚Äôt voice cayde during caydes final story.
---
Thanks! Just trying to help the community where I can. I don't like the toxicity in a game I like to play you know..
---
I can hear this image
---
"I am the weopin."
---
Me a random titan.
---
I just wanted to express that the "wee shield" is slightly nuts.
---
It‚Äôs 50 charges. You can get 2 per completion. 2 charges then the boss round.  And it‚Äôs time locked like all the other.
---
I play 2 rounds of crucible per week for a few bounties. If I want to play PvP I pick a game from Battlefield, Halo, or COD. 
---
I don‚Äôt mind being bad or losing in Crucible because I don‚Äôt care as long as I get a couple bounties done with. 
---
And why would any casual care about their performance in a game mode that they don‚Äôt practice or care about?
---
I think you are projecting how you would feel in that situation.
---
Daily OEM energy gathered
---
Maybe they forgot about it because it didn't do anything. I don't understand how you can say seeing people through the wall for like 15 seconds after they shoot at you, doing bonus damage after getting a kill on said person and then also a shield, an overshield, and healing all at once isn't broken unless you use it as a crutch yourself, or you're just a headass.
---
I think the calls for nerfs are more symptoms of just poor matchmaking. Seeing as how anyone putting in the work to get recluse is going to be a decent to high skill avid crucible player the fact that I'm getting matched against them in my second crucible game this year highlights the actual problem. Better players using extremely good guns make those guns seem ungodly strong
---
As a PVE Nightstalker main I totally feel you on this.
---
That could be the answer, they‚Äôre new to games.
---
I mean destiny just went free so there are an influx of players because of that, they definitely aren‚Äôt going to be of the highest quality.
---
Well I'm a shoulder charging Unsurmountable Skullfort OG Titan!!
---
Cool, thank dude! I do plan on making prints of it / selling the original.
---
Well quite a few do where as my clan is open to all adults with one aim to bring players together in an environment where they arnt pressured or made fun of for kd, gender or playstyle where players can get help if needed and not be forced into activities only thing I ask of any member is respect each other and the community

Trackless waste with kill clip is hilarious

And I mean they've now nerfed bottom tree striker into to ground, didn't use it, but still. Titan's do get the shit end of the stick besides OEM, which in my opinion isn't a big problem, and shoulder charge which requires you be good with it and don't get shotgunned mid charge. Don't get me started on PvE either. We literally JUST became useful again for more than just melting point with the release of Shadowkeep. #StopTheHateOnThiccBoiTitans

It's amazing how toxic people get about mt and recluse that they can't even watch some dude yeeting himself to death and enjoy it without bitching about them
---
Yup. This pirate claster picked up wrong fight.
---
Weapon quests, must be 15 - 20 different weapons to grind.

Work in your clan, offer to help someone.

Grab a friend, I regularly run it with two because the other friends are dead.

It‚Äôs my favorite helmet right now !!

Rip

Would been better if it has the icons for the guns
---

---
warlock is so fun and nez/crown/lunafactions are all tippity top tier builds
---
Not really. I have only done it a few times and haven't had a steady group from it. You on PC?
---
Yeah but it only seems to do it when I queue up in the strike playlist
---
Is the key glitched on that map
---
It was still glorious, so don't worry too much.
---
One time I got dropped in all by myself. I mentally prepared myself for a boring 8-minute stomping but lo-and-behold the other team also quit. Seems I got matchmade into a win trader situation and won.

Pop a rain maker and head to Sorrow... on the moon and help kill everything.  If you have a ghost with treasure hunter perk you can just run around getting chests.

In PvP activities I can kind of expect it from newer players. Whether it's a gear based issue on not having much to work with, or just takes time adjusting to the game. When I had started playing  Crucible in D1 I had limited experience playing Halo prior, and had just come from playing Black Ops 2 primarily on hardcore. While I'm no PvP god, I'm pretty decent when put against the populace. I sucked so horribly at PvP for a long time because of the shields and the verticality of the game. It took me quite to not stop firing after a few shots to guarantee the kill.

Aftershock just looks like a pulse nade so they probably think it does the same damage of a pulse nade and they can run through a shock or two. 
---
On top of that, both pulse nade and aftershock have terrible fucking visuals that are basically invisible on anything light in color.
---
Hmmm I would say it‚Äôs a bug/glitch but I‚Äôm not sure because I just finished getting my Jotunn yesterday
---
If it doesn't appear on the bottom left of earth's map I dont know what to tell you.
