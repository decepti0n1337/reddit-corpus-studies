I'm also having this issue. It says I don't have the season pass and therefore don't have the +1 additions to light that would unlock through playing.
---
---
---
Oh, ok thanks.
---
Bungie is trolling us PvPers at this point
---
its ok. kills weak enemies in a maybe 4-5 meter radius. leaves a knight on 1/2-1/3 of their health. if it doesnt kill the enemy then they get pushed pretty far away
---
I mean now we don't even have a strong super to balance lack of nuetral
---
Damn son, charge your phone. Nice roll though
---
or you can go into the ahattered throne in the thrall room. i got 8 catalysts done in there.
---
Yeah it’s no worries. The Destiny lore is poorly explained and even more poorly understood unless you literally are watching it every expansion since everything gets shifted just with one entry sometimes. One thing is that the Hive changing morphs is something they’ve been able to do since before they even met the worm gods (like Savathun wanting to be a mother). But that also may also be a lie since Savathun says everything Oryx said is a lie.
---
Hoping everything else is going to be really awesome this season.
---
Didn’t look like it did burn damage to me, that’s a pretty rare status anyway.
---
Get a job
---
Tell me about it. I've got 450+ hours as a new light starter and don't even consider that a lot. Mind you I did also get over 200 levels on the pass so maybe it was.
---
She'll be fine, but I should mention I don9actually have this roll, I was just looking through potential rolls on the companion app
---
You know it won’t be
---
The eververse store is like the best its been right now though. Its a free to play game now, they have to get money somehow. It cant just all be free or it would turn into gta shark cards
---
The timing could not have been better
---
In conclusion. Turtle.
---
Same, please give them back.   
---

---
Will they still work on armor 1.0? If so, nevermind.
---
I don’t see anything special about this gun.
---
Probably because it’s orange
---
Oh hell yes!
---
Dang, that's super handy.
---
Fair enough, good luck in getting it then.
---
Just used it for 5 matches myself and god damn it is fun, the rate of fire is unreal.
---
Cayde-7!
---
Really nifty, thx.
---
I have hope. I did happen to get 2 exotic drops in my 1st 2 games of the day.
---
Unpopular opinion: riskrunner is better 
---
Bring on the downvotes
---
On a very basic level, they are chasing that dopamine rush of achievement, even if it's just the slightest, imperceptible on a conscious level, hit from making progress towards the goal (Savior title in this case). 
---
Human psychology is a funny thing.  We all have our hamster wheels.
---
That's not the point.   I rolled in with matchmaking and no one had EV on or the bow.... no one seemed to know about the rally flag so no one had super it wasn't hard but it took longer to run that re-skinned menagerie than it should of.  The f'king arena shouldn't have been needed to unlock the artifact.  
---
I'm just bitter over this dud of a season already.  I hate being knocked back down in light and having to Re-f'king grind back to where I already was.  I hate content going away.... basically just really starting to hate this game.
---
You shouldn't. Ace is pretty easy.
---
I got the new titan chest armour but that’s just even less reason to play
---
I'll get ornaments when I can turn ANY piece of armor into an ornament. Until then, meh.  
---
\*stares longingly at old 1.0 armor\*
---
Imagine letting Warlocks be a viable class
---
This post was made by Bungie hang
---
I could do that for you. Just toss me you address !
---
Oh sorry I forgot about the 40 year olds that love in studio apartments with their family because they are bums that still play video games
---
Lol that’ll be the real test! Just gonna wait for the new meta to settle so o can decide what character to use
---
Not a bug. Read the patch notes.
---
HOLY SHIT ITS LORD SHAXX
---
No, my buddy told me over headset to shoot my shot towards the rocks leading from A to C and I trusted him.
---
Me waiting until I get paid to buy shadowkeep deluxe
---
I wouldn’t say that based on this video alone. It killed a group of thrall, that hardly speaks to its damage capability. I want to see what it does to red bars and up before deciding how useful it is. If it can’t at least kill red bars I’d actually say it’s fairly weak.
---
To my knowledge you can but only for the non random rolled one
---
“THIS IS AMAZING!”
---
Help yourself dude. Memes are made to be shared.
---
Not all the content is free.  Elements are free to play, sure.   Eververse was prob best for players several seasons ago when we had new cosmetics in engrams (completely free) and only a few items which were silver only.
---
It depends I guess. For someone who just started I will never be able to finsih old stuff and farm new exotics. I think. Unless I get into a clan that will push me throw things easy. I didnt even finish all the moon stuff and havent gotten all the moon weapons and now I have to grind for Dawn(and I played a lot in the last 2 months). In my opinion season has to be longer, than 3 months. But that would be shit for people who already have everything.
---
that would neuter it in pve though, sometimes you gotta be a bit more nuanced with balancing.
---
Imagine not caring about improving your character🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
---
Not gonna lie - I've done it before on game/dlc releases.
---
Ladies and gentlemen.. no one... no one in the entire world... THIS IS ADAM
---
Only your character is transferred, not the content.
---
Took me too long as a youngin to realize it was 2 girls licking his asshole/balls that he was talking about.
---
*Me who's still not gotten a title despite playing for a few years*
---
Titans complaining about throwing knives while they throw their hammer and pick it back up.
---
Honestly tho, does this matter? I mean Mercury is small as hell, which is the reason we couldn't use sparrows there in the first place. This is like getting in a pool with a boat. Like yay.... We can travel across this small ass area faster now yaaayyy.....
---
You usually have to grind for good weapons with good rolls. Especially exotics.
---
You have my condolences
---
80% of the store is free, last season was 50%. Like I said, its free to play now, it wasnt a few seasons ago.
---
So hunters shit their pants when they dodge...
---
I’m aware. I run it with Ophidia Spathe. The reason I know not much else procs it is because I liked the build so much I spent several days trying to find weapons that could compliment it. Spoiler, the aren’t any that do the job well.
---
Just got mine masterworked today due to all the sniping required, too.
---
Gotta read his quest steps, he is going to let us know when he has 'recharged the Sundial'
---
So next week.
---
there is absolutely now way this is intended. it would make this exotic completely useless in a season thats primarily focused on solar.
---
Feels bad
---
I’m sorry I can’t help I play on Xbox but if you have any questions I’ll try my best to answer them
---
Its working, they changed damage numbers
---
im not talking about the buff
---
I sure wish I could play this, but Destiny gives me the code honeydew whenever I try and play.
---
Doesn't it miss the two bars on the vertical front spikes?
---
Yeah, the ability to kill a Super with a shoulder charge is nice. 
---
When it lands
---
Use your eyes.  "New quest available"
---
Tortle✅
---
there is no way that 60k off a super that requires a precision shot AND an exotic is intended.
---
Yep, they're pretty decent and a lot of fun. If I could get one of thsoe to drop with demolitionist I'd probably have a trouser related accident.
---
Of course Bungo gets rid of the thing I need to grind for one thing.
---
Oh I don’t know then I know they changed the subclass for sure
---
This kid looking at me for answers like it's a damn Madden game. Bye Felicia
---
If there’s one thing of learned from D2, restarting your game will fix 99% of problems
---
You don’t need a gun to proc a throwing knife though. Or an ability.
---
I got the Black Talon catalyst too on first game.
---
I got one that makes it able to burn though supers and bosses
---
Well, it has been hours now and still has not been fixed. I have tweeted at Bungie, and posted to the Bungie help forums and still nothing.
---
Nice, my steam username is GrayWolf hmu whenever you want
---
I think it's one of the coolest look helmets.
---
You get that buff that your ult consume so it doesnt work with that 1 exoctic. That is my guess. Check patchnotes
---
I really like how it could be implemented. Especially from a match game nightfall situation.
---
what buff? im not talking about buffs. im talking about base damage.
---
Right, "picking something up via osmosis" or some such. As in it kind of "seeped in". It's a bit far fetched but it sounds pretty cool.
---
^ My pain is felt in this. But the best times are literally just those 'One two punch' Enders. Those are amazing.
---
Nah rat king best exotic
---
Came here to say this. Well played, sir.
---
ye pretty much
---
Im surprised they didn't consider sunbracers but considered claws
---
when something has the capability to oneshot waves of guardian with one pull of a trigger and especially when it can kill someone that easy when he is in his super just because you aim at a general direction i dont think that makes it balanced.And the nerf lord of wolfes got was a joke  if you take in account the multikill potential this gun has
---
That new buff from precision dmg. Just read patchnotes.
---
Considered what about claws
---
Osmosis isn't unique.
---
nobody is talking about buffs my guy. stop talking about buffs.
---
This really isn't new information. Don't know what to tell you.
---
I might be able to make myself proud.
---
Same. Had no problems
---
Nice. I didn’t even know one bullet two kills was possible in destiny until I did it the other day momentum control grinding for Revoker
---
Kinda shit tbh
---
Then make him one.
---
You know it got changed right? Shoot a precision shot and look left. Because of that change, it doesnt work with that subclass. That is my guess, but I havent bothered to read patchnotes, like you.
---
No speed demon :/
---
sweet!
---
Yeah it plays the intro audio for a second and then it cuts out. Works fine after that.
---
Ok I see what happened. They basically neutered bottom tree while pretending that they "reworked" it. Bottom tree was only ever used with Nighthawk and now it requires major setup to be AS EFFECTIVE AS BEFORE (not more effective)
---
How. Are.   You.  Playing
---
Claws used to take 2 melee charges with ball lightning instead of 1. 
---
They fixed that
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
i'm surprised they looked at Claws but not Sunbracers
---
Yes
---
Yea I tried that, didn’t work:/
---
You have exactly explained my point. The payoff hasn't happened, and even though the new season has come out, nothing new has come of it. I want to explore this more
---
I actually do like it, and this is the universal ornament too, not the armor pieces you can get. I wonder if you can apply some variant of gold to it and look like a space pimp.
---
Feeding frenzy and one two punch dear god that thjng looks horrifying
---
This guide is excellent, thanks for taking the time.
---
Two things about this game as a new player.
---
1. I didn't realize you wore a helmet so I made my Exo look totally badass only to realize I have a helmet on 98% of the time
---
2. This game is probably one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. I've played The Pyramidion strike maybe 5 times last night just because of how incredible it looks.
---
Unstoppable rounds also works
---
No THE original is to label clowns
---
This is getting really irritating.
---
It was functionally a shitty auto rifle.
---
Something something seige dancers something something
---
100 Gigs. FML
---
That’s kinda dumb actually yeah. Glad they fixed it. As for sunbracers specifically that is a new issue, heat rises worked fine in its previous iteration
---
What makes it so good?  I got one and didn’t find it that great.
---
Then git gud buddy lmao.
---
Yeah saw a guy say he got that aswell, will be interesting how strong that perk is against bosses!
---
Yes he is
---
I did 3 rounds of protocol on Mars to get it done, a boss appears at the end of every round.
---
ok calm down trollolol
---
For me it’s majority of my pinnacle items. It’s the games fault for training me to delete the 3-4 blinking items in my inventory after every activity!  “Delete that, delete this, delete thi- wait that was a high light level... shit”
---
Bruh they should ban you for the grammar you hacked in that title.
---
NO
---
No
---
Its just Rng. Its also because the powerful gear cap has been increased etc.
---
Damn this is incredible.
---
Do the campaigns and consult reddit or YouTube when u get stuck, it’s a lot to learn coming in this late. You’ll get used to it. And it’s worth it.
---
Think so
---
Well I never knew
---
Personally i got the deluxe edition because you get the most out of your experience, but i would say get the deluxe edition because you can use the past DLC to level up and build your guardians so that when you get to the newest add-ons you dont struggle as much with skill and below average weapons
---
Are you high
---
I was unaware. Oops
---
oh no the mass blueberry hunters still gets easily killed strange. OEM blueberries migrated to hunter
---
I’ve been informed it is not unique. My mistake.
---
Knees are stronger than both.
---
Definitely bounties. Make sure you also purchase the repeat bounties from e.g. Banshee, Zavala, Shaxx or Drifter. Every completion gives you around 9-10k and you need 100k for each level.
---
Guess who's back....
---
.. Saint-14
---
I know, it was a new perk added from the new season update and wanted to inform people who hadn’t seen it yet
---
Hey man you want some explaining, I can help you at this time tomorrow
---
I was surprised i was able to knock out aerial kills in one strike. Still low percentage for the other two steps.
---
That’s a very good point, someone will find out soon I hope
---
I figured most will considering it's on the ritual sidearm but fair
---
They know about it: https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1204542663371812865
---
Uhh
---
Eightball before, two lines after. Perfect.
---
Fixed, accept my apology, from one guardian to another c:
---
That...that explains so much. Mr. Torgue is my favorite npc of borderlands (zane is my fav playable character). And titan has always been my go to class.
---
I got it on IO at some point today. It's pretty darn good I have to say.
---
Don’t apologize, even over comms people mistake me for a dude. It’s fun to see how long it takes people to notice lol!
---
I see, I did make this post fairly new to the update coming out, so people may not have seen or got the sidearm yet like me
---
I love my crayons
---
Let me know the results!
---
Arbalest should work too, shouldn't it?
---
Zane was my main in BL3. He is, hands down, the funniest playable character (Kreig is really close though) and he had the best lines. Torgue is just my spirit animal.
---
DID WE JUST BECOME BEST FRIENDS?
---
It’s not just you. The user interface on Destiny is shit. I could fit all 15 screens of data into 2 screens. 
---
It took me a while to figure out how to navigate it, don’t feel dumb.
---
Wow, so an anti-squeaker, thats a rare sight. Played once with a girl who did voice overs and stuff like that, she could pull off a mans voice perfectly to the point where i would ask whos talking thinking someone else joined the discord. Turns out she just liked pulling shit like that and baiting people into thinking shed a guy...
---
Garden world I think
---
YUP!!!
---
Bruh,! Fr bruh dafuq brah
---
oh it is momentum control, you can see me getting 1 shot by hunter melee
---
To link different ones. It says somewhere that you can only link a certain number of obelisks and once you unlock more than two you'll need to choose which ones you want to link.
---
This made me cackle our loud. Was not expecting that
---
Mine was zhalo :’(
---
If I could edit videos you'd see one by now lol I am having a hell of a lot of fun and if people from xbox start calling for nerfs you can blame me for completely abusing this shit
---
I mean I do too but things like voidstreak and always on time, two of the most prestige sparrows in the game, have fixed rolls. im a voidsteak person myself.
---
Ouch :(
---
The Rapist...Reddit has screwed that word for me.
---
Wait until it gets its overhaul

---
This is much better directions lol, I don’t know wtf I was thinking not talking about the map
---
I mean, top and bottom tree Dawnblades have no exotics pretty much aside from Sunbracers so this is one of two subclass-specific choices. And it’ll probably be decent-ish but I’d still run Sunbracers over it.
---
Ok hunter
---
The only way I knew to previously acquire this weapon was to have it drop as a random reward from Spider bounties on the Tangled Shore.
---
Society if Bungie stopped fucking over warlocks
---
its giving me PTSD type 2
---
I totally agree with ya bucko. All classes need to find peace.
---
the real star here is Old Fashioned coming back.
---
You could always just Google stuff too? Lol
---
Hey pal, did you just blow in from stupid town?
---
Did they increase the hard cap on gear?
---
That’s your own fault
---
Ok
---
Titans have to build resilience..... Hunters didn't get fucked. Titans did.
---
Collections
---
I think you can reacquire it from your collections
---
If you dont have $10 to spare just dont buy it, I dont see why you cant come to that conclusion
---
It's still a monster though. Sure, Subjunctive or Exit Strategy compete easier with it now - hell, subjunctive with multkill, outlaw and a reload masterwork is my go to most of the time.
---
But Recluse shines in that it still gives bonus body damage with no need to reload and can be swapped in with the perk already active. In ad clearing, crit shotting is nice, but not major.
---
 Recluse frees up every other slot to use an exotic of your choice in to deal with enemies that require serious damage that's not dependent on a kill first. 
---
It'll still see use everywhere, as most other competing smgs require RNG to be comparable or outshine it in a specific use. Even with bungie shifting the meta, it's a great pairing with longer range weapons to serve as clean up or a panic close quarters- it's just not a get out of ambush card anymore.
---
Bewbs
---
Symmetry is amazing since its a pseudo assault rifle in close range and a fairly nice sniper at medium range when using its alternate fire more. Its generally worthless at long range because its automatic fire mode is too innaccurate and its alternate fire mode has rounds which are probably the slowest of any kinetic weapon.
---
It’s sooooooooo good
---
Mr. Fantastic with full body tourettes, I'm dying xD
---
its not about pricing. Its about paying for something that should be free. Do you like to pay for a pass that locks content from the expansion you already bought? Bungie fanboy too much?
---
In comparison to other games and their paywalls; destiny is nothing.
---
Gonna have to deal with it since people are trying to work on that Crucible quest which rewards you with a linear fusion rifle.
---
Yea , I know and that’s 100% what I do ...but to me that just seems like extra grinding for no reason lol because in the long run you’re spending more time in strikes anyways , when we could just all finish the bounties in 3 runs if we worked together !!
---
Chasm of Screams. You can solo it EASY using Arbalest.
---
Rng. My friend had them drop in a strike. I had them drop from a knight on Mars.
---
*sad sunshot noises*
---
I used this ship as a joke whole season of the opulance. I used to call it 4+2 house.
---
Plus not gaming at night with the lights off.
---
only 1,200 silver
---
I’m running arbalest. I freaking WISH I could use sunspot :’(
---
it’s because they’re terrible
---
A slightly less evil one, yes.
---
I just use a sniper for gambit tbh, sometimes mountain top as well.
---
its got that bonus dmg to shields thing right? so no need to match shield type?
---
Is it worlds first? I mean, i dont have worldline, but seems like a fairly easily achievable medal. Am I missing something?
---
To activate hac
---
Hmm. Don’t have mountaintop but I’ve heard a lot of complaints about it being too good. Do you suggest I use fighting lion or my black armoury heavy grenade launcher to do the quest?
---
It's just for the Pinacle. Give it a week and they'll be gone.
---
Nope it doesn't
---
Fuxk got me chuckling like an idiot in the snow.
---
We want it to be difficult, but not that difficult. Like, it needs to be hard, but easy enough to do. Why is this so hard to understand?
---
Army of one is simple, but I searched pretty much everywhere from YouTube, twitter,  Reddit, Instagram, google pages 1-5 and saw nothing so I’m guessing it’s the first documented one if anything
---
Not really a meta just people grinding for the ritual weapon tbh. Still a solid weapon to be fair
---
We would be to if we had buttons for this stuff. In cayde’s last fight he switched between blade barrage and golden gun, or he at least tried using blade barrage I think. Point being, all a guardian has to do is manipulate their light in a different way. There may be different speeds for how fast someone can change between subclasses and subclass abilities though.
---
At least tyl rygor has great voice acting, is one of the better boss fights, and with a decent setup you can speed run that shit in less than 5 minutes.  Last I played I helped my brother with some runs and my heavily forma'd Mesa could melt through his phases laughably quick.  Plus you're guaranteed a piece each time even if it's a crapshoot for what piece you get.
---
The worst is doing spy runs for Ivara parts that have like a 7 or less percent chance to drop on C vaults.  Grinding for Nidus parts is unbearable as well because not only do you have to play an awful and unpopular mode through 3 rotations at a time but then you have to do some stupid index quest to get the BP where the AI on your team can screw you. 
---
Not to mention the multiple mod grinds where it only has 1ish percent chance to drop every 3 rotations
---
Equinox farming sucks but it's not even close to the worst grind in the game.
---
It worked, ish, for Mars.
---
The arbalest spam will die down in the coming weeks once people have gotten that crucible lFR mission completed.
---
My loadout was Malitias birth right, fighting lion, play of the game. Triple G
---
Grenade launcher
---
For fuck sake relax.
---
It’s pretty fun, I got mine last week but I didn’t know you needed forsaken but I guess it is a forsaken exotic so makes sense
---
Ooh nice B) does the colony count towards the quest?
---
That’s one weird looking dog.
---
I haven't got on yet. Is it true???
---
I must be retarded because I keep clicking the from button
---
Id say why bother, but it sounds like something id try and do if i had the time. Let us know how you go lol
---
I wonder if it says killed by The Bombardiers. IMO it should do that with all the exotic armor pieces that kill you, like Liar's Handshake.
---
idk what i expected
---
I have, I've only been in a full fireteam once.
---
Yes, but I didn't use it because one hits with play of the game is easier
---
Bouncy bouncy.
---
Ooooh such a good time.
---
Sadly :( I realized that I couldn’t get the forsaken exotics back when xur sold oem last time.
---
Love it, better than last already!
---
Ahh ok. Thanks :)
---
Homie it’s not a big deal. It’ll chill when people finish the VERY short grind
---
how do you get that?
---
First of all arblast actually takes some sort of skill to use unlike jade rabbit. Second chill tf out
---
Oh such a good time.
---
So they finally fixed my lore + but then Tess won't stop flashing. I hate programming. You have 36 bugs, you fix one, now you have 49 bugs.
---
I chose not to get oem mainly cuz I don’t play titan and personally I hate titans in general so I refuse to play as one
---
Holy fuck I am so excited. I am buying dawn now, a 720 kinetic that can roll Feeding Frenzy and Swashbuckler? I'm in.
---
**Nintendo lawyers enter chat**
---
Its probably not noted because it is so simple. Not trying to be negative but the 'worlds first' title should be attributed to something definitive and a decent feat. Perhaps theres a way to track medals accross guardians idk, but given the medal has been around for a while id be willing to bet people have got it, especially giiven people have completed 100% of all triumphs and medals in this game.
---
Lol using a throwaway account huh?
---
On pc maybe. On console you’ll be hitting the occasional crit but it’s not a laser like it is in the land of minimal recoil. I’m still going to use it in pve regardless of how trash it gets though because it’s proof to myself that I can get any weapon I want even if it’s from crucible.
---
Awesome !! Being as I loved the last season as well I can only imagine how much fun I’ll have 
---
I love the positivity !! I can’t wait to get home lol
---
I FUCKING KNEW IT
---
Though the best for that would be monte carlo if you somehow got to the point of needing to wait for a throwing knife charge
---
“HANDHELD SUPERNOVA”.........Thanks for playing
---
Still ;-;
---
Maybe we should all start some Jotunn spam to make OP happy.
---
Army of one is given to a guardian when they wipe the enemy team, regardless of the weapon they use
---
When you look at your shaders are you in your collection tab?
---
I think they mean specifically using Wordline Zero. Most of the time you can get two or three before getting sniped/Truth'd/teleported back, to be able to get everyone with a close-range weapon like that is impressive even if it's not the first to do so.
---

---
It's strictly looks diffs on genders so choose what you think looks best!
---
I get weird about this stuff and it really shouldn’t matter what gender characters are because we never see them pretty much but I just want to know that my character looks good to me and think that others think it’s cool looking as well and I feel that a lot of the hoods from certain clod tend to look a bit better on males
---
Then don't buy it?
---
Wait....people actually like high rof ARs? WHY THO? Slower with higher damage is where it's at. Gimme SUROS Regime with 360 rpm hitting like a hammer and shooting straight as a sewing machine any day over a wild ammo dump with crazy recoil.

Have you seen the upper Midwest recently?

Then don’t buy it

What happened to paragon mods? What trait now speeds up class ability regent like rifts and vanish?
---
They didnt think anyone would be dumb enough to use unstoppable arrows
---
It's happening to me too. I looked at Tess' store to see if anything needs to be hovered over but I didn't find anything. Only thing I can think of is if it's not a bug, it's a marketing trick to get you to go to her to spend money. Since we know "strobing/flashing" indicates we need to do something in-game, then that is a great way to attract foot traffic to encourage microtransactions
---
Yeah ive been using it since gos and I just cant use anything else anymore lol + now with the double enhanced loader from the artifact you dont need rapid hit anymore for kill clip to be strong
---
Why are you thinking too far into this? It's a video game. Take it as it is.
---
Ok I'll give it a try thanks
---
Sunbracer is better for the top tree, you literally get your nade faster plus the melee regenerate faster while getting kills when flying
---
Damn dude
---
Attunement of Sky is real fun with Sunbracers too. Try it out if you can.
---
I have a love-hate relationship with my almost God roll.
---
Box Breathing
---
 High impact Reserves
---
 Liquid Coils
---
BUT...  the goddamn charge time masterwork, which LOWERS THE DAMAGE
---
Reminds me of some spaghetti Gary's mod animations.  
---
RIP Kitty0706
---
Why would sidearms need a nerf??
---
It will be very good when the arbalest spammers settle down
---
It does. My friend picked it up earlier.
---
But riskrunner is somewhat better tho
---
Go home and be a family guardian.
---
You can use them in PvE too in harder content... though for some reason Savathun's Song, the best strike to use it in due to the many tall pillars here and there, has increased aerial damage taken as its Nightfall the Ordeal modifier...
---
Install destiny 2 companion app
---
Go to fireteams tab and request there or find somebody else with your situation 
---
That’s easier bro
---
The ability to speak does not make you intelligent
---
Thanks mate.
---
That's entirely unhelpful; in the previous season, Overload Arrows took a single shot to proc the status, unlike rifles which take sustained fire for a few seconds.
---
There's no reason it should be any different now with Unstoppable, and there's no indication that it was changed to be like that.
---
It's probably a bug.
---
r/fireteams
---
It's a LADYBUG
---
I've spotted an oem and recluse user
---
thx 4 your help buddy
---
No need to load the farm if you have the heroic version, it's selected like a strike from the earth menu. averaged 1.5min per 2 kills, it's really not bad. But if tangled shore is more accessible and faster for people they should do that of course.
---
It's to mess with everyone who'd like to believe attunement of the sky is endgame PvE compatable 5head
---
They have their own cookbook
---
Some exotics I had, mainly armour, had other perks along with the special perk
---
New frame type as well
---
Just gonna bring up a few things that the other guy didn’t cover
---
- Base D2, Curse of Osiris, Warmind, and parts of other DLCs are now free with ‘New Light’
---
- Nightfalls are relevant now, and pretty difficult too
---
- Old Campaigns are now optional, they can be accessed and replayed from Amanda Holliday
---
- We had pinnacle weapons, until we didn’t
---
Hazza a man of quality!
---
Put it back
---
I guess I was concerned that the old stuff didn't get updated or something, but if that's not the case then nbd
---
Warlocks really are scrawny, aren't they. Guess that doesn't matter when you have space magic
---
Yeah and who knows space wizards like skinny jeans
---
Need to bump those numbers up, those are rookie numbers.
---
Not a chance in hell, no. Liar's + One Two Punch is too damn strong to put down. This is a fun exotic to shake things up a bit and give crucible apes a reason to reconsider their lives. Outside of that, i'm not sure it would hold a candle to the already dominant PVE exotics for hunters.
---
The top full season pass rewards are usually the only thing behind the pay wall and everyone can do the seasonal activity
---
Aww yiss.
---
Get the fuck out
---
Yeah but it does a ton of damage in return... Always thought that would counter act that
---
Bit spoilery to say this but do the quest from osiris :) Dont remember the name unfortunately
---
Glad I found this out from you guys on here !! All the guides I found online hadn’t updated to say that they were, hence me trying to grind for the drip to trigger the forge quests. 
---
I’ve managed to get all the keys open for the mysterious box through all the forges, I’m just stuck now at the hands of the rng gods to drop me a rare bounty with Ada-1 so I can continue my quest line for the Burden !
---
Guess I’m just going to have to grind her dailies &amp; hope I get one....
---
What nerf did we get?
---
It will most definitely not be as good as Dragon's Shadow (with its indirect buff due to mobility tied with dodge cooldown) or Stompees. In 6v6, yeah it will be around, but it doesn't have much practical utility in 3v3 scenarios.
---
because bungie excluded sleeper from the blanket 20% precision damage buff for linear fusions in this latest patch
---
God yess i got a reaper, seventh fucking column and  a 1v3 survival with just the throwing knife
---
I fucking love it my biggest mistake was not having a screen recorder, gonna download one today tho cant afford to miss these moments
---
Mainly because there's no need for a guide to any of it. Just kill. If it's immune throw a ball at it.
---
The only thing I'd reccomend is that you definitely use a sword matching the element boost, they absolutely destroy everything. My void sword is outdamaging my whole team as an additive. It's incredible.
---
Dude she nuked your game
---
I am also wondering this
---
I had a shot of the top tree Dawnblade last night in PvE and it's actually really fun for PvE.  Good synergy between the ranged attack and Sunbreakers, as you can consume a grenade, fire that ranged melee for a kill, rain down 5 grenades, eat the last one, then if you have a high strength build and killed 2 trash mobs with the melee, it will have instantly reset and you can do it all over again.  Pretty fun.  Looks like a you're raining down a meteor shower xD  Be even better if you equipped Monte Carlo, but I tend to reserve that shot for my sniper (which is equally fun to use floating in the air above bosses with the new changes).  Ultimately, the whole floaty thing obvs useless for damage phases in raids etc, but it's pretty enjoyable for everything else.
---
I've always played Voidwalker in PvP, so thankfully the nerf won't affect myself in crucible, but it's a shame if it's been gutted PvP wise for everyone that enjoyed that subclass.
---
I don't know when that would be so I have make do with what I have. I just need to full push the stick to keep it semi centered and fire from there
---
I seriously love reddit! Thanks!
---
No problem. Apparently the stability bonus on controller/console is a lot more noticeable.
---
Yup, came to say the same. I think it's just a website bug and it doesn't really give you anything in the game. Checked everywhere but don't have anything new in postmaster, Eververse, Rahool or my inventory.
---
Try to blow hard into the stick(s) and see if that fixes them, it did for me.
---
Should have kept money from last month for it then
---
you need to be in a fireteam with ratking.
---
Arbalest is my all-time favorite weapon - it's amazing both in crucible and PVE
---
In lobbies with many apes.yes. higher skill brackets dont tend to mindlessly rush on people and other playlists even use snipers more often, like elimination. Its a good trap card to use in the case of shotgun ape emergencies though. Its likely not a ohk, that would be busted. So if they come at full health you still need to follow up quicky to finish them off, or put a bullet in them and then dodge.
---
Personally I cant wait to do a trapcard build with this, tripmine knives and tripmine nades. Ill be the troll in the corridors lol
---
Na the Regular one is 960 the Pinnacle is 970
---
It’s at 960 now lol
---
I borrowed the special tool and learned to open and disassemble the controller, this is the second time it fails and I have opened and cleaned the pieces
---
But exotics and fates engrams are merged now arent they? Like every exotic.engram is a fated engram so it should give you something you dont.have. unless we are still using the current season exotics being excluded from fated's so not everyone gets the new stuff as soon as xur comes
---
What a big difference. Problem is I just hit 950 on my main character
---
sweet got the new titan chest piece. gonna try it out once i'm done leveling my warlock
---
Ten more power levels to go then
---
I think the sleeper nodes part might need fixing. When I combine 4 resonate stems no ‘Override Frequency’ shows up in my consumables or quests.
---
Becoming a hinter main now
---
Wait a minute..... something isn't right
---
Buy it in two weeks then?
---
Uninstalled the game of that guy.
---
They buffed it to instakill on a headshot, but added a wind-up time in the form of an animation to balance it.
---
It doesnt leave grenades. It creates an explosion regardless of what grenade youre using apparently. Which makes sensen
---
I don't know what it is but as a warlock main, the most class that i have killed in crucible are hunters, then warlock and then titans, with the ratio being 3:2:1. Either there are too many hunters in pvp or most of them are like the crayon eating titans.
---
Did you receive anything from the package?
---
From a rare drop
---
“Hold on guys have to check my glimmer account.”
---
And this plugin will work with me using a PS4? And should I be saving any of this gear I'm out growing? It seems I have been upgrading stuff really quickly. I just got to item lvl 805 last night I want to say and as I got better gear I deconstructed my older stuff.
---
You can change the homepage URL [in the Steam settings](https://i.imgur.com/J3ckmd6.png).  
---
Just fire up the Steam overlay in-game and you can pull items to and fro.
---
That’s kinda along the lines of what I’m thinking.  Gotta get the hang of being a floaty boy, and utilizing heat rises/ dash more.
---
If you bought Shadowkeep Deluxe edition, you get 4 season passes with it.
---
Yea same, Wolfcastle’s accent sounds Russian to me as well, despite being Austrian. Hence I drew this connection.
---
Me with 100 mobility and perpetuation. 
---
Who needs to dodge more than every 3 seconds
---
Does it say the season pass is active? Since the season is active for everybody, but only the free part (top row of rewards) if you did not buy the new season pass.
---
Or....did you buy the deluxe version of Shadowkeep?
---
I knew it arbalest would be more than just my gambit meta
---
It takes up heavy?!? The hell? 
---
Yeah, why would you give that up lol. Unless it's broken or required to use in unlocking a future pinnacle hand cannon or recluse's follow up.
---
Looks cool I wanted one
---
Yep but this season isn’t free :/
---
That or you might be on one of the Mars quest steps. Those lock it too since the step has you go open a specific box.
---
Cissy Jones (sloane) and Jamie Chung (Ana bray) are
---
Nah, I'd rather get a slice in the MNZ
---
Hilarious. Made me laugh! +1
---
yeah and there’s a good reason for that too. everybody i know at my high school that’s played it (with the exception of someone on my track team) just didn’t understand it or didn’t want the time commitment, called it a dead game, and said some pvp only game that can’t really compare to destiny, was better. i’ve been playing d1 since house of wolves when i was like 9 and throughout elementary, middle, and now high school, kids at all my schools just really hated it.
---
Well done sir.
---
Well I got shadowkeep and I cannot get eriana's vow rn sooooooo.
---
In any game mode?
---
They buffed the shit subclass tree that let's Warlocks float forever. They changed the melee for that class though and since it's amazing, I've been using that tree. I have completely relearn how to play with my floaty Warlock now. My claws that I've been using for the past couple of weeks (cause they look cool with my current set) are actually coming in handy now
---
Im getting an error
---
Okay but it’s just the AoE yeah?
---
I will give that a try.
---
Basically it acts like you have 2 pieces of gear to infuse when you only have one in your inventory.
---
I tell everyone you’re my favorite guardian!
---
Yes,  Ophidia Spathe and class ability 50
---
They seem like just one part to me 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I'll never understand why people waste vault space on exotic weapons.
---
You might have to finish all of the normal adventures forat then the heroics will be available
---
Thanks I’ll post it there.
---
It means hell
---
I just did this on mobile, it worked for me.
---
T pose is truly the most powerful move
---
Exactly. They saw Saint 14 as the only thing that could stand against them and respected him because of that.
---
in the Crucible when you proc the grenade and use the melee ability it one hits like mini nova but at longer range. it’s a blessing to Warlocks and now i can’t decide if i like it more than attunement  of hunger with Nazurecs Sin and Recluse.
---
You know, I used to hate Hunters back then, but I dunno man. I kinda love everybody now
---
Straight up Kung Lau teleport kick. I’m in.
---
The other is just a 0 light replica given to S-14 soon after. Don't mind it.
---
ah nvm i think heavy fusion was just in destiny 1
---
^ in mobile, this worked for me.
---
Forgot about those tbh
---
I’m wet and I’m a dude
---
Hell yea yo
---
What? Why would she say that?
---
1. How she assumes you are playing with kids?
---
2. Is playing with kids considered bad?
---
Reminded me of [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA0SfPx4BSA) I felt so bad for that kid.
---
Does this mean we can get old armor as armor 2.0???
---
Wendigo is Playlist Strikes only. Edgewise works in Nightfalls.
---
I guess hunters just started taping them down. Mine included
---
I laughed so hard at this. Well played
---
The collection badge has an emblem and just one shader apiece this time around so I would agree they are two part quests.
---
Thank you so much for introducing me to this sub.
---
They probably made the bounties generic because they didn’t want people stalking out the dials time like they did for vex offensive
---
If I remember correctly bungie said there selling it for bright dust, correct me if I’m wrong
---
We received reports of this being fake/wrongful information and initially it was removed for that reason. The removal reason has been corrected.
---
Accidentally did it on my hunter instead of warlock... Got bombardiers!
---
Alright alright alright, let's see what you're fighting today... Black guy with a bigger dick than yours, on the horizon
---
What was it even for?
---
Vex Offensive, it was a portal into the timelines with the Undying Mind(s)
---
I was
---
Cut in half
---
Ahh okay. Thanks.
---
Sorry new to the game, how do i get arbalest as of now is there quest for it?
---
Whisper is a heavy sniper
---
Bungie's policy for things like this has always been lenient. They don't ban people for discovering or abusing things that are ultimately their mistake.
---
To be honest with you that sounds fun
---
Oh, well I don’t have it yet so I wouldn’t know, thanks for telling me tho:)
---
Because Tess is an indiscriminate, gender fluid hooker that wants your money. Otherwise, a glitch.
---
It's definitely 2 since i'm at the second step of the vanguard quest. I'm just wondering if there's another step after it, since it doesn't seem like it.
---
The fact that Area 51, and 21 Savage are in the top 10 as well really don’t make it all that impressive. Sigh.
---
You obviously have not bought everything yet.  
---
Still blinking?  Buy more.
---
I am surprised Bungie has not developed a credit card yet.
---
To be honest with you that sounds a lot like GAMBIT
---
I think it’s a battery but if you really want to be bothered, tell me how the scope on Icebreaker works
---
They fixed it it was a loophole with the season artifact
---
Don't group up and it sucks
---
Ah yes, the source of Ada-1's most tsundere line
---
no joke, I have SO many 1.0 armor and weapon pieces for when full transmog makes its way into d2.
---
Love it. That was generally my idea. I’ve always loved sunbracers, there just wasn’t a reason to really run them much...until now.
---
Uldren or Shiro-4
---
Weird way to spell Izanagi but OK.
---
At work currently so I won't have all the details, but there's mods you can put on your gear that Regen super charge/abilities when using rifts. I imagine he stacked them. Was curious last night if the mods stacked.
---
It's asss
---
Which hunter set do you think I should get. I main hunter.
---
Howd you get the nade to come back
---
I watched this like 10 times.  What is happening that is game breaking?  I must have missed it?
---
Swords actually use a battery type item to constantly resharpen themselves don’t they? How else would a sword stay usable after hitting a giant killer robot.
---
Thanks for the Bombardier!
---
Finals? Homework is worse
---
I’m assuming pretty common as I got the graviton lance cat AND LoW catalyst at the end of the like second strike I did with the season.
---
I think it’s basically just being handed out rn for the new season
---
I got a Sunshot ghost that I didn't know existed yesterday!
---
Bungie should combine destiny 1 and destiny 2 into one big game so that it really does feel like an ever evolving world.
---
And it screws your light level if you are gonna do something like Iron Banner or Gambit.
---
Unless the guy also wastes upgrade modules on recollected exotics he'll eventually dismantle. Which would be a stupid waste.
---
I’m probably going to use my mindbenders then, I do want the masterwork on the lord though
---
Thanks for your asnwer. Me too, a clan asked me to join, but the motto is to do for others without expecting anything in return... I would love to do anything for anybody without even asking for it but it's like a group of single players :D
---
Anthem?
---
Is this a general question or are you somehow already at reset since yesterday? Also, no there is no reason not to.
---
lmao it shit easy to get. arbalest 5 matches then u lv up to heroic and bam u done. arbalest is also easy to use so thats nice. its like a sniper for people who cant aim.
---
That's cool and all but d2 is a more team reliant game at a higher tier level. Teamshotting is all the game is unfortunately so "dont group up" will just lose you games. This quickplay was just an extreme example. Not to mention you get a full nade back.
---
Ace Combat Infinity is dead
---
Hmmm
---
But but but don't you want kills to drop RIFTS that you can't even use since you're going for kills during your super?????
---
I played two or three times a week, throughout last season. Usually playing hours each time. I got around lvl 110.
---
When you level up you get a lot of XP bonus. Also, each reset gives you a XP bonus for a limited time.
---
Finally: BUY CONTRACTS/BOUNTIES/QUESTS every activity you do. Everywhere you go. They all give XP.
---
Yeah it’s pretty damn well made and all, but if you try to play it beyond just casually it becomes toxic as all hell.
---
D2 in fact has a much nicer PvP to me because of that. While there are overpowered loadouts and a natural imbalance because of gear, at least it’s mostly skill-based and has a chill and more mature community, even in the competitive playlist.
---
WHAT!? WHAT!? HOOOOOW????
---
Omg i can’t stand that. “I don’t have this product so I’m not sure” then why the fuck are you replying??? I always respond to those.
---
Thank you!
---
It also chews through my reserves like it’s an auto shotgun.
---
arabalest was my favorite wep before the update and didnt the patch notes say it only increased precision dmg when it all ready 1 tapped the head
---

Great! That sounds doable. I was really slacking last season. I played destiny 2 for quite some time, but very casually. Thanks!

It actually works, got monte carlo

---
Hunter Vanguard. Calling it.
---
You absolute star. Cheers!
---
No. This is an article from CNN about the Top 10 searches in a bunch of different categories including the “Where Is...” category
---
Arc web regens grenade energy on successful chains.
---
How is it in pvp?
---
I know
---
Hunter warlock or Titan?
---
Plenty of guns in video games are functional designs. Maybe I play too many games like escape from tarkov and arma and steer away from the goofy cartoony ones. 
---
In destiny, that's why I usually opt for the gambit weapons. They're all fairly similar in design to real world weapons.
---
I hope so too. I want to be one of the friendly guardians with him.
---
Cayde could’ve used this
---
Menagerie is the most interesting non-raid PvE mode there is, I wish Vex Invasion had been half as interesting.
---
Warlock
---
Just watch xHOUNDISHx for finding out his location, his videos are great, and the Xur videos come out about half an hour after daily reset
---
Is the dab emote random drop of nostalgics or something? (fairly new player)
---
Hunter throwing knife is nasty in PvP, recluse is still good. Jotunn still good.
---
In the hunter vanguard lore there is a thing that if a huntet kills the hunter vanguard he will became the new vanguard. Or something like that.
---
Weapons or skill tree or armor?
---
Cant you spam melting point+PG+ monti?
---
All 😅
---
Freaking gorgeous, like always! If anyone needs a commission I can highly recommend u/Azlaar.
---
No, I do have shadowkeep, though. These achievements shouldn't be DLC gated
---
I would be so happy if these made Sunspots, but unfortunately they do not :(
---
I suppose youd have to go look at old footage
---
And a whole lot of ass
---
&gt; Of course not, that was only for the past season
---
Thanks for the answer. May seem obvious but a lot of people are coming back to the game after a long time and shit has all changed.
---
and the $60 doesnt include the season pass?
---
When Uldren killed Cayde he wasn't a Guardian though. Does it still count now that he is one?
---
Bro stfu shit doesnt need to be nerfed. If you were good at the game or had common fucking sense you would see that
---
Okay I am a warlock too lol. They just reworked top skill tree dawnblade to do soemthing with moving around while airborne, I use bottom tree so I’m not too sure the changes or how good they are. For PvE the best thing I’ve seen is chaos reach + getaway artist exotic gauntlets, those things are insane. PvP I switch between nova warp and dawnblade based off the map. Contraverse hold exotic gauntlets are really nice in the crucible when playing nova warp, they give you grenades way more often. Deathbringer exotic rocket launcher quest is gained on the moon and that gun is crazy. I’m really liking the forge and the moon weapons. But weapon loadout is your choice. Any questions about something specific?
---
Yea but this one is still less tedious
---
You obviously have never left quickplay or sit in comp all day 🤣
---
glad to be able to help
---
Why aren’t you “good” with dismantling?
---
Are you going to use it within the next Y E A R ?
---
Not everyone come back as a guardian when dies but Uldren was resurrected by a ghost. I think that counts. But we will see.
---
Typical father of 4 or boomer comment right here. The bots that ruin the game
---
I sentence you to 10 years salt mines
---
How do you claim on the website?
---
Like for PVE , what’s the best weapons to use in the new season?
---
Komodo cuz of new enhanced linear fusion rifle artifact mod.... use arabalest.
---
Hold up. Are you telling me data matters more than emotional oppression narratives based on 10 second opinions?
---
oh snap.    ok then... yes.  this is my favorite weapon.
---
Vanguard
---
I got the gun day 1 in like 2 hours
---
Just grab a pistol and go into strikes solo, if possible into one on nessus and farm a lost sector
---
What’s the best weapons to use in PvE?
---
Do you have forsaken and have you done the campaigns ?
---
 Not timed event. Should b a yellow quest you can purchase from drifter in his inventory. The quest is called the draw , I think. I just did completed it.
---
I’d guess that’s the one they were talking about, bungie said on twitter that they temporarily removed a titan set because there were purchasing issues or something
---
Double check through your 'quests'.  When I returned to Destiny after having not played for a couple years, quite a few of the exotic quest lines were given to me without having to visit the original quest sources, including the last word.
---
The Stadia version has all the DLCs. I have yet to finish the campaign.
---
“I’m gonna be a phalanx when I grow up and my shield’s gonna be thiiiis big!”
---
He’s actually accurate... Forsaken Cayde-6 was garbage.  the writing for him was cringe and bland
---
Thanks. Not really a fan of Linears but I’ll give it a shot.
---
Yep....You need a minimum of 3 of every exotic you use (each element), plus a minimum of 3 additional per armor slot for elements.  Then if you want mobility armor for crucible and resilience for PvE you need an additional set of 3 per slot.   
---
So you are looking at at least 135 pieces, if you just have 1 exotic per armor slot you use, for just loading out your character, that doesn't include additional exotics per slot, weapons, stuff you just don't want to dismantle because you can't get it back, ghosts, sparrows, ships, and consumables.  Not to mention mods (transmat effects and such) &amp; shaders.
---
I mean he's not wrong.
---
The perfect counter to arc web is to just not play grab ass all game
---
Oh, then Idk. It should be there even without completing the campaigns.
---
Did you finish the campaign?
---
I believe you have to complete it in season 8
---
And while the perk is active, the fire rate increases to 1500 rpm and the stability gets a +300. It has so much stability that the gun shoots down. Did I forget to mention it has a reload speed of 0.2 seconds?
---
It’d be kinda fun if they’d put in some kind of in-game mechanic to find Xur (not google search or random-ass chance).  Make it some kind of mini-puzzle to find him a little like a lightweight concept of opening one of the forges.  Come weekend time, you pick up a random quest drop that tells you to go do this lost sector to get this token to open this chamber blah blah.  Not hard but at least a little engaging.  *shrug.
---
Thanks! I’m already about halfway because of the Sundial Handgun and my Warlock. Lost Sectors is a good idea!
---
My thoughts exactly.

guns probably

after playing with it for an entire evening i think its not OP. you still gotta land it, i had an average of 2-4 knive headshot kills per game which is fair enough i think but i would remove the bounce of the knive, got one bounce kill which doesnt make any sense to me why this even is a thing, but besides that I think it's pretty balanced and a high risk high reward ability
---
You mean the Age of Simulant?
---
60 year old here, starting gaming just a few years ago. Playing Destiny since it came out on PC. This is my number one favorite game. I just love it...although PvP is very daunting.
---
That was nerfed way back in forsaken
---
Same thing EA does and people love it LOL
---
Titan smells a traitor Titan is angry TITAN SMASH BLUEBERRYS!!!!
---
yeah ur right too
---
As a Warlock I can fall for eternity, and right before I hit the ground I can jump and immediately stop moving mid-fall, and land safely. Titan jump slows your descent gradually, and sometimes it's not enough, and you still die. Warlock &gt; Titan.
---
You can only combine one at a time and it stacks on the stems you already have
---
Warlock jump can make a lot of the platforming sections easier and even faster since you can glide pretty far, but yeah if you mistime it or get the angle wrong you're pretty much fucked.
---
rangefinder threat detector
---
its playing on the "thirst" of others. on one hand, you be like "oh,i don't like playing with boys cause they treat me differently. on the other hand,"oh,help me, cause i'm a girl, tee  hee!" c'mon
---
I don’t mind the bubble. You guys use what you got, but If titans would find a PvP strat other than a one hit shoulder charge that kills a guardian with full health and a shield, ill quit complaining. Hunters have nothing comparable. We either have to use our super or sacrifice our exotic armor slot for a small boost (it is small) when dodging.
---
Just give us full transmog for in game currency and I'm good.
---
It's far from a dead game lol
---
It was good last month. Got god tier in gambit anymore I guess since I never had it used against me. I quit because it was so gamebreaking
---
This needs to be an ornament because I need this
---
Was it? There was a weird time where it felt like everybody was just using Sleeper in Gambit, and no one was on Queenbreaker's anymore. And it was definitely before Truth came out. Maybe I just ran into some weird lobbies.
---
You should’ve seen the post later by the same person, I’ll link it to show you in a bit
---
It's finally hunters turn
---
Catalyst probably
---
it was previously in D1 and no one complained about it, and it was even stronger back then, not to mention tripmines sticking to enemies with one shot capabilities
---
I disagree with the Sleeper statement in this, but aside from that I agree
---
Yeah. Haven't played crucible yet but recluse is still damn good for PvE
---
That’s still eververse
---
Guess what hunters! it's your turn to be at the buisness end of the nerf bat haha, that instant refresh on precision headshot is crazy, I've not messed with it yet, still enjoying flying around as a warlock.
---
nice kills.
---
Take my upvote
---
I want it '-'
---
Most people don't, but I like the big freighter ship design. Still prefer my Cabal exotic, though.
---
The quest name is the Machine's Gun, OP stated  "More accurately the Machines gun part" which sounds like he/she is on a step that requires machine gun kills, not that he was naming the Mission.
---
jeez
---
I’m having an blast reading these
---
Catalysts are triangular. Unless they changed that with the new season.
---
Could you imagine trying Crucible?
---
I still rock my Orchid. Have always loved that HC.
---
im just gonna delete this post so no more salty players downvote
---
Every class was really strong in PvP in D1, that's why nobody complained about it. Unfortunately, the classes weren't created as equally in this game.
---
I was thrown off seeing the yellow exotic engram since it’s been quite a while since I’ve seen one drop in the wild.
---
I only needed 4 points for Buzzard
---
Atleast I used edge transit once in a while
---
You remember the first season of Gambit very differently to me then.
---
Lies
---
Yes in OUR world, in the destiny universe war famine and disease had been all but eradicated then the darkness came and gave us all those problems back and forced us into a single city a single bastion of humanity then sent these genocidal alien races our way idk about you but it seems just wrong to find a society that had pretty much delt with it's issues then give those issues back and worse than we've ever seen them before.
---
Drop damage, swap it to the energy slot. Suddenly, it's a decent PvE Linear Fusion like Arbalest without being Recluse (pre nerf) levels of hand holding.
---
[Blame Celebrity Jeopardy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hElOag-1a0k)
---
Same here mate, I feel you. Been tinkering with no fix so far.
---
Get used to it. Its here to stay.
---
We need mod-able Ghosts. They'd work just like armor does now, without the affinity bullshit though. We could increase mod capacity the same way using the mats we already use. 
---
If Bungie would let me put Guiding Light, Speed Demon and Combo Detector on any Ghost and I promise those Eververse only Ghosts will look ***a lot*** more tempting. That is the exact Ghost I'm currently using, the Moon one. Forgot the name, but I pulled until I got all the combo detectors that I actually use and swap out Ghosts depending on the planet I'm on. Works great too. It's nice always having chests and resources marked no matter where you go. I'm downright spoiled and can't go back to regular peasant ghosts.
---
God, I love that noise
---
What was the nerf is pvp?
---
Truth gets Izanagi'd and teabagged pursuant to regulatory code 69 subsection 420
---
They did not
---
Catalysts are triangular
---
I'm scared to try the new ones knowing how much the old ones that work properly can epically backfire in the field until they announce they've fixed them.
---
Also, the new favorites feature for finishers sounds cool and all but... I'm honestly never gonna use anything except this once I get it.
---
Ima have to disagree with you. In sweaty and tourneys it’s not hard to get out of it, all it takes is a hunter dodge to kill the chain and with proper call outs it makes it way harder to get more than a single kill with it
---
God i hate truth users so much
---
bungie did say that some things including that quest line was season 8 only if i remember correctly.
---
Jesus
---
You crush gladly let me f*ck her when I told her I have 70,725 triumph score.
---
Resolution resets every time I start the game, too.
---
Is it like the hammer? That has a little bit of tracking, if it is it might be OP, if not yeah props to the guys that hit it.
---
lol I'm happy to have contributed to this.
---
that armor vanished from the store for me and i really wanted to buy it
---
f
---
Fitting. No hunter wants the job, so of course Cayde wishes it on his worst enemy.
---
Neat got the new titan chest ... Pretty useless but it looks cool
---
Yep
---
I got the LoW and Graviton Lance catalyst in the same strike, and in the strike I did right before it I got the Black Talon catalyst. I think they're being handed out pretty liberally.
---
Dire Promise for me. Stupid high aim assist. If I could put a targeting adjuster mod on it it would be a face magnet. Also it looks like a six-shooter. Like something out of a western.
---
Common does not mean guaranteed.  It means that it happens more often than those where it is likely.  What exotic are you looking for?
---
Why do you think it's great? 
---
Is it the Explosive Payload, or do you use a different roll?
---
Also, you playing on PC or console?
---
I don't think most Americans know where Area 51 is tbh. But it's not exactly uncommon knowledge either.

If you miss a ledge you’re doomed to fall to your death because warlocks cant recover. 
---
Also You can’t die from the impact of a fall. You always survive with partial health.
---
This is sick. Awesome job man. Love it.
---
I believe they’re all guaranteed to rotate through the store at some point during the season.
---
Yeah man. Gotta pass that time any way you can.  At least it wasnt like fucking shadowkeep. Jesus man. I was in a 37thousand player queue for 4 hours. Idek how that's fucking possible
---
Since it's just a circular shell with a shader on it, and not an item referring directly to a Nintendo brand, I highly doubt so.
---
Now if the Shell would've been called something like " PokéGhost" there's no doubt they would have.
---
You can get same effect using Monte Carlo to recharge melee
---
You gotta bump those numbers up
---
I don't mind grinding content. Where I get confused is how to redo things I've previously done. 
---
For example: Last night I played through the initial quest for this new Season of Dawn. At the end I picked the Auto Rifle (my prefered weapon type) and I received different perks on it than a buddy of mine. If I wish to try to get the same roll as he did, how would I go about playing that mission again? Do I talk to Ikora again? Bounty? Etc?
---
The Izanagi you are referring to, is that the exotic sniper rifle?
---
[removed]
---
I too have a controller where the right analog stick is going hard left at the slight movement on it, game got more challenging, but the unexpected kills while spinning are the cherry on top.
---
Don't do it, OEM Titans are the bane of the Titan race.
---
Where the xur

If you’re not interested in helping her then don’t, no reason to slut shame just because she wants help from *guys.*

Maybe she likes the attention.

He is just so done with your shit he is vibrating in anger. That or sulky rage dancing.

---
this gave me an idea what if there was a feature where we could send our ghosts out to distract the enemy and they just draw all or most agro and maybe they can shoot like an arc soul and maybe have low health or somethin 
---
idk i just thought of this so its a bit rough
---
Really good goods. Exotic weapons and armor. Need lots of legendary shards.
---
Hi

It’s a very common drop
---
I wont

At first I saw the number and was like that's all. Then it clicked.
---
If the sweeper bots had fought in the red war ghaul would’ve never taken the speaker or traveler #changememind
---
There are class specific finisher on the eververse. Hunter one specifically, whips out his golden gun and shoots then stows it like old western movie. So dope
---
Literally girls on Twitch. Complain about sexism in esports but the reason why half of them getting money is because they're female.
---
What is the chance you will actually get guiding light on it?
---
Go Tigers!
---
Thank you very much for your replies! Another thing that I'm a bit confused on is can I get an exotic item back if I accidentally scrapped it? 
---
If I like the look of a certain armor (for instance, last season's titan armor) but the stats/perks are better on another armor set, what are my options? I know I can infuse for power level, but is that all I should be concerned with? 
---
What's the point/benefit of the season pass offering multiple copies of the same armor pieces? I know the very latest tiers look different, but is it just for the chance to roll different perks?
---
Ah yes the Marksmen, master of long range comb- what's that? His mission has him take you into a cave no bigger than a lost sector? Ok then
---
Console and one reason is the explosive payload. I have a roll with accurised rounds, snapshot sights and explosive payload and a range master work. It saves distance falloff a lot and flinches Guardians like a mother fucker. It's also great in pve because if the radial damage in big packs. It's just my tried and true baby. Also it feels damn good to shoot, it actually reminds me of shooting my .357 magnum.
---
Really? I've been playing Destiny 2, including strikes, since June. I have gotten maybe 3 catalysts in the 6.5 months. And I log in yesterday and the first 2 strikes I play, I got catalysts back to back. That has to be surprising
---
*skyburners oath has entered the chat*
---
Nerfed. Don't be a scrub.
---
I’m talking about Black Talon and Lord of Wolves almost everyone is getting them.
---
Oh no that sucks
---
We have Symmetry.
---
Yeah that's a really good combo too, especially if you don't want to run top tree. Upside of top tree + sunbracers is that you can get your melee back from grenade kills alone, and with enough red bars even before the sunbracers buff runs out, meaning you can chain it indefinitely. A lot of fun in things like Altars of Sorrow
---
Yeah. So are you a man or a scrub?
---
right? like alot female streamers wearing low cut shirts.good for you, you have boobs.let people decide to watch your channel for the content though.don't get me wrong,i LOVE boobs. but you can't have it both ways.
---
😂 REEEEE... Made me LOL thinking of my son when he screetches this. Makes me laugh every time.
---
NYOOM
---
Well that sucks 
---
Makes sense though you couldn’t squeeze a grind if there was a guaranteed method 
---
I’m looking for the Hallowfire heart for fashion reasons 
---
And nah I’ve gotten a two exotic weapons (whispers of the worm, Lions roar) and one armour piece (the one that makes fusion Grenades faster and make them explode on impact)
---
I think symmetry is decent, it’s fun but I just don’t like scouts personally haha
---
Anyone who posts a “nobody” meme should be banned from Reddit
---
Bungie put out a notice that they were having issues with PC settings resetting to Default when exiting yesterday.  They are working on the issue.
---
Why... Did you buy them?
---
It's a special linear fusion, which you needs kills with for this season's ritual weapon.
---
Moderately improved graphics for destiny 2?
---
Like you cant even play Destiny 2 on a console 4k AND consistant 60 Hz!! Those 4k resolutions are worth shit if your damn 300€ box cant even handle a game smoothly! And how tf are you saying that a 4k and maybe 50 fps experience is better than a lets say 1440p 144 fps AND ultra settings gameplay? Like are you even asking yourself these questions when writing half the bible about a simple complain?? xD
---
Also my fucking Keyboard is 3 years old and it is still working properly and its not even a high end tech, its literally an office mechanical keyboard like come on bro...
---
Honestly, it has to suck to still praise consoles to oblivion in 2019, they dont suck but for real you cant compare the damn performance of a console to a gaming pc. Like the only console I would buy is the Nintendo Switch just because I want to play those exclusive games. About the rest of console only games I dont really care much, thats why a damn pc is enough for me to work around the whole steam library!

The head waggle as they sink out of sight. I'm dying.

It's the enterence for the house where uncle Drifter and aunt Ada-1 lives
---
its destiny, can you explain why thrall's claws are electric
---
Thanks, but isn't the game platform specific? Only PC players are online with PC players, Playstation with Playstation, Stadia with Stadia players etc? Regardless, thanks for the nudge, I'm more open to it now.
---
You should use a different shader
---
r/unexpectedspaghetti
---
Thats some Mortal Kombat shit
---
yeah, i was really wondering if i was going insane
---
that's hilarious! take my updoot
---
Healing and invisibly on every kill. Rat pack is just a side gimmick.
---
I need someone to show me around on destiny 2 (xb1)
---
I'm actually the same! Ran throwing knives since the very first CoD they were available... However, until now, Destiny's were slow and even if you hit a precision, they wouldn't die from it. Thanks to the new sandbox, this new throwing knife is faster and OHK to the head, although it does take a somewhat lengthy animation, but it is quite manageable once you get used to it
---
This is the type of content I want to see in my reddit feed!
---
It will always bee a no skill crutch so long as it is still a laser beam and had perfect recoil by default. If you don't know what really makes it OP, then don't speak. Name I mean you, console plebs.
---
Literally every reddit is made for sharing pictures/memes lmao, meanwhile people like you make a big mess about something that can be easily fixed
---
I guess bubbles and safe spaces go together rather well.
---
I think you're right, the different platforms don't play together, but I'm on PC too.
---
Yep, that's what I am talking about.  It is a two way street.  You want the other person to be happy, so it is a give and take kinda thing.  Just not sure HotlineSynthesis gets it from the post he/she made.
---
Just use Crimson if you want healing and invisibly is just. stupid gimmick that doesn't work. Sidearms are just dumb.
---
If you can't put the time for playing destiny, the game is bad
---
Only a quarter of the progress without the season 7 pass now though, so defo stick with prime for faster route
---
Lunafactions actually seem to put some meat on you though
---
Have had people do this with final bosses in LFG raid runs, people have been doing it since D1. Feelsbadman.
---
It’s still good, but absolutely not as good as before. No more aggressive overshield pushing changes the way a lot of titans played with OEM. Still good, but no chance is as good pre nerf
---
Where is that I couldn't find that in the store
---
Bungie confirmation about it not having to be equipped like before?
---
They do
---
Thats why you do some elaborate shit the day before SoD drops fellas. Chess &gt; checkers.
---
Pretty sure that's from a game called Remnant
---
You are correct, but it could keep them from doing it to someone else.
---
I don't know if I missed something in the patch notes but I think you're referring to the change to where all exotic engrams act as  fated engrams to where they are guaranteed to give you an exotic you don't have
---
F
---
I'm having so much fun with the granade float time, see people going under you on crucible its the best thing dude haha
---
I've always seen lunafactions as *padded* tho, no?
---
Sunshot. Fell in love since it dropped for me a long time ago. Hardly ever without it either PvE and will often equip in crucible.
---
In PvE the explosive rounds and chain reactions are a lot of fun. In PvP I equip as it just works for me.
---
XBOX.
---
Some people like it, some people think it’s shit and are extremely vocal about it. I personally think it’s very good.
---
Those most def changed???
---
Unless of course you LoS the rocket and make it detonate one a wall. While it is annoying, if you can figure out which aide the invader spans on you can hug cover and bait their shots.
---
It really is my favorite weapon atm (may I also add it was my first drop?!?!? How insane is that!!!). Recluse can go sit on the bench for now. A new favorite has risen.
---
I resemble that remark

He kicked you so hard you fell off the server

The ones from Tess are straight up Street fighter moves.

it’s people like you that make me ashamed to be a people

What is Veteran Dialogue ?
---
It’s not out yet. It’s a leak.
---
Just a tip, they'll not listen to anything in here. This sub is made up of and ran by players that enjoy Destiny 2. Bungie doesn't come here, and personally I'd rather people that don't play or like the game don't either.
---
A ritual weapon that sounds useful. Wow.
---
I've never been more proud of this community
---
Oh no! In shaking in my custom made baby seal leather boots.
---
"PSA: Titan jokes are getting real old and annoying, please stop." problem solved
---
it’s called noodle smack
---
How much silver is that going to cost &gt;&lt;
---
Thats to bad
---
Cool. How do you earn it through gameplay?
---
So far all my armor rolls have been crap even a 956 gear, so keeping my undying equiped
---
Like a billion pvp scout kills and even more medals.
---
they wont work if you apply 2
---
Me too! Just got Exit Strategy and Delirium, working on Hush and Python now.
---
My favorite pinnciel quest was Redrix, though.  It was long but more importantly it was varied.  Now they are "get 450 scout kills" but Redrix was more interesting.  "200 precision kills, 75 double kills, 5 resets, etc.  None were as hard individually but together were a ton of fun.

CONFIRMED CAYDE-6 IS COMING BACK

It only happens when the teams both get really spread out. I’ve seen it a few times but if both teams stick together pretty well it’s not a problem.

Safety first! We all saw what happened last time when a ghost died.
---
That would be broken in raids (six man solar grenades)

Thunder thighs!

Hunters help hunters ;)

Oh cool so we get to be Sunsingers again

I like to eat the grenade I have for the extended glide before activating the melee. Continuous death from above.

Jesus Christ that is cute

Why is the subreddit full of boomer shit all of a sudden?

oh i thought halo was made by bungie 1 and destiny by bungie 2

It has been like that since Forsaken, its the week when the curse is strongest.

Not only if your ulti is charged. They burn all the time

imagine getting mad because of memes.  
---
chill out bro
---
Felwinter's shotgun worked plenty fine on Ghosts.
---
How do I get Eververse to stop blinking?! I’m about to destroy the whole tower myself if I don’t find out how to get rid of it.
---
Are you on crack?
---
No they do not, and I can’t imagine them doing it for specifically the EDZ.
---
How do I get the gun?
---
We get it, yall hate wahmen, chill out and move on instead of whining about it.
---
You should have edited out the teabag
---
Man this is so sad it's literally like a 100 km off of southern india, this is offensive to us Sri Lankan people and that was a joke
---
Bruh wtf is that token count
---
I enjoy this because whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.

Aye

---
Skullfort?
---
Yes. SIVA was sent on the _Exodus Black_ but it was inert/deactivated. 
---
The reason why SIVA was used to murder the Iron Lords was because Rasputin was still in _MIDNIGHT EXIGENT_ protocol, which is to stay ABSOLUTELY FUKKEN HIDDEN. With the primary SIVA fabricator destroyed, what we have left is what we got. There's no reason why Rasputin cannot take control of unaltered SIVA samples to Do The Thing.
---
(That and a buddy cop film between SIVA!Saladin and Rasputin would be hilariously awesome.)
---
For that RPM Auto rifle I think the extra bullets will help you get 3x kill before needing a reload, especially if you're not always getting headshots. 
---
not 100% on that.  Plus I don't know what other rolls it can come with.
---
Yeah I agree it’s one of the biggest patrol region they have. So that would be a lot of ground to cover
---
probably a catalyst.
---
It differs.

We have two guys in their mid teens in our clan. One of them acts pretty hyper and the other one i would've guessed was in his 20's lol
