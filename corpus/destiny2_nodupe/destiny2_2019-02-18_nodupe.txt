Isn't the bergusia even worst though? When you suck at raid you can't even get it for god sake!

---
---
You don't need the helm to do that. Just run top tree 
---
Yeap, I guess it’s necessary to include instructions like that, cause some people actually don’t know that they can shoot through the banner shield. Was doing NF and, by Traveler, this hunter kid kept on peaking out to shoot enemies and going back behind me. I moved a little to the right, thought maybe there was some obstacle or smthg, but nope. He kept running in and out. Mind blown. I’m out. Back to hammers.

Foetracer is like a downgraded effect of one part of OEM

You don't actually lose points. But once you reach legend, you don't get any points for a loss and it takes about 20 wins to get through legend. 
---
Took me about 2 months to get the last drop I needed as well haha don't give up on other titles too! I almost quit destiny for awhile from trying to get Rivensbane but finally got it on my 45th raid haha (I know others have been so lucky)
---
The forge activities have matchmaking and most of the quest steps are soloable, so yeah. It’s been worth it for me.
---
Old guard D1 player came back to and picked up everything for D2 just like 2 weeks before TLW quest dropped. Greatly enjoying my experience as a solo player and I’m up to like almost 640 light 
---
Nice! Petra’s Run is all I need and my team is going for it tonight. What was your strat to prevent guitar? 
---

---
I also have Blacksmith done and I just need the ship and sparrow for Dredgen and we’re approaching a full curse week :)
---
I stopped dawning cookie production at 420...  I thought that just as fitting as this one here.  However, as a Y1 player, my CD emblem already had well over 200 on it at the start of this year's event (sad face).
---
I was doing EP earlier with a WoR Warlock, they’d pop ult, I’d set down my barricade with like six of us in the Well, then pop my ult to block the Ogre’s attacks, and poof! Everyone decided to leave our little camp for some reason? Come on guys, draw the aggro to the shield, I make orbs, then we all have our ults back! 
---
No assmir
---
I mean yeah I feel ya. But that doesn’t mean you just give up. You keep trying and trying through these services until you find people you like and add them. Continue the cycle. You may find a really good dude and then he might have a much of other good dudes he’s friends with and there you go you have a group. Just keep trying. Trust me I been there in your shoes. You’ll find people I promise. I would never of found some of these great people to do stuff with if I never would of tried and put the effort in. You WILL find people it’s just a matter of time. Seriously. It’ll be worth it. Majority of all these famous clans on destiny all started through lfg’s. That’s how they all met. You think majority of players who play with groups started by being friends IRL? Because they didn’t lol they all met online. Just don’t give up dude it’ll be worth it in the end. You’ll make some connections. What platform are you on?
---
The Machina Dei 4 reminded me of it. Used it a lot in CoO.
---
Find me something considered a no scope that is more than a single shot kill, things like urban dictionary define it as a single shot, it even defines doing it to somebody next to you takes little to no skill
---
nah....  Etch-A-Sketch...  lull...
---
If your talking about the radiant seeds, there’s a lost sector on mars where you can skip straight to the end and the boss drops 10 at a time, takes about 6 minutes total 
---
Buy it play it have fun with it.
---
We tried not having any tracking emblems and started it quickly. We normally have bad luck with the guitar error but got lucky I think. Weirdly enough we had the most deaths on kalli and in-between her and shuro. Once we got past shuro we did it first try haha. Congrats on blacksmith! I haven't even attempted that one to be honest as I'm the only one who routinely gets through the sparrow race. Dredgen was my first and the meatball spawn rate is so much better now haha
---
Thanks
---
Lemon poison never runs out boom.
---
For all intensive purposes
---
The other light makes her look like a Vex.
---
:(
---
The ornament is called Positive Infinity and I got it from recovering 35 data things on Mars. You gotta find and shoot the glowing signals with the corresponding element it shows. There is a guide on where to find them. The ornament was a random drop, I think I was in the Dreaming City.
---
I’m a solo player. It’s been great so far. For multiplayer activities like raids you can always use the destiny companion app for Looking for Group section
---
Same. I'm going to be getting on Xbox here in an hour or so to run a few and hopefully have it drop. If you're on XB and wanna run, let me know!
---

---
Oh, absolutely. They're not unkillable. It's just a crutch and sad that they need it.
---
Just like any other quest exotic, it is put into the loot pool after you obtained it the first time.
---
It’s always Dust Rock Blues
---
I played the base campaign while leveling my titan recently so it's fresh in my memory. Otherwise I probably wouldn't have even understood the joke.
---
Sounds like you know how to use it nice. I wasn't saying it's a bad weapons but it's certainly not for everyone. 
---
*air horns blowing in the distance*
---
Are you running that combo with lucky pants as well? If not give it a try. 
---
*zoom*
---
No you won't. Because it doesn't have any encryption as you don't take it to the cryptarch, you just simply didn't pick it up, it is already "decrypted" to be something 
---
Hey man, have you heard of our lord and saviour frostees with 5 paragon mods? near perpetual invis if you just keep sprinting, like half a second between invis.

“A CELL!!!! FROM THE PRISON OF ELDERS!!!!!!”
---
23 clears and still haven't gotten anarchy. I clearly upset RNGesus somehow.
---
This happened to me. It hurts. 
---
Oh nice, I think I have run through it 3 times but I think I skipped it once. Still I should have remembered because it's such a good moment. 
---
But it doesn’t rhyme and cayde’s death isn’t something to joke about. Otherwise, good post! :)
---
Ok I figured, thanks. 
---
Nope
---
Yea the 40!match grind is horrible 
---
No, I was waiting for others to post...
---
“How’s your sister” in the comments... then it would rhyme 
---
Concur
---
Now if only I can find it in game...
---
Thanks! And so what is a "frame" regarding the weapons? The base weapon sans mods?
---
But why is the person running away holding an Ace? That’s equally an over abused weapon, plus they probably also have a shotgun equipped considering they are using the Ace.
---
R/woooosh
---
Why is my Heart Attack taking so long?
---
One of these days
---
It’s swear I got those too from her the other day! I’ve been getting new Exotics like CRAZY ever since I started playing again 
---
its indeed satou tribe
---
When you start doing Black Armory content you get a basic frame which is a quest requiring a bunch of steps including beating a forge saboteur to get a weapon core, defeating a certain amount of certain enemy types to gather resources they drop then it will require a set amount of kills with a set weapon type then precision kills with weapon type then killing powerful enemies to gather more resources then after all that you return to ada 1 and will get the weapon frame to forge which requires completing a forge ignition and you receive a Black Armory powerful weapon. If you have one of those frames not forged when the weekly reset happens you lose that frame but get returned a ballistics log which is used to purchase the weapon frames from ada1 this sucks if you forget and have one of the free frames you get as part of the forge quests as you need to complete these for forge quests and sometimes they are not available again in the next week and can take time to become available again. Sorry my punctuation sucks but hope this answers your question 
---
&gt;Give 
---
Was about to say, this reminds me of Captain Rex
---
Running it with one eyed mask that tracking is nice which leg armour do you mean ?
---
It's fun but honestly it's very situational for decent use. I tried it on the vold forge boss and it worked okay, but he stepped out of the box I built.
---
My psn is NosignX 
---
Mine sits in the sink then meows for water
---
Then what would be the point? Luna's and Not Forgotten are not OP, as Hand Cannons they lack range and if the player doesn't manage the 3-tap via Magnificent Howl, it's just as good as every other HC. You can combat it easily, just don't think you'll win your close-range 1v1's. If people can keep getting Luna's every day - so can you.
---
So once I complete two frames on a character I gotta wait for weekly reset or switch characters?
---
Say it out loud
---
Switch characters. 
---
 Jötunn drops from the Bergusia Forge, only when forging Powerful Weapon Frames. If you're lucky enough to get it, as you beat the Forge it would be directly rewarded to you; it does **not** drop as a physical engram on the floor beneath the Forge. You have 6 chances a week to get it, 2 Powerful Frames per character. It took me 18.
---
ALSO if ya'll aren't carrying alot of motes, that's half of would-be invaders that won't try to invade because they're waiting to see that white bar at the top get bigger.
---
I have learned this. I am saddened. 
---
Thanks!
---
Using this now. I had been using way of the Pathfinder. With a couple of super mods it comes back right away. Really good setup. I just need a good kenetic scout rifle for the forge drones.
---
The Big Boy update isn't ready for deployment yet; please stop leaking information.
---
Cayde used to give me exotics all the time :’(
---
r/bigyes
---
Well they did say they added it to the loot pool at well.
---
Its onlys relevant on PC
---
Sorry I’m being a dick 🤙
---
Um... Some dude just asked how to do this. It's relevant to him. I'm informing the other guy it was strange to assume the guy asking was a PC player.
---
You can open a maximum of two EP chests in a week, if you didn't use a key from a week prior, otherwise you have one. Braytech weapons drop from the schematics you get from Sleeper Nodes. The Osprey is from the Strange Terrain Nightfall.
---
Or she was drawing the [Watchtower](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/1280x868/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Finsertcoin%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F09%2Fdreaming-city-destiny3.jpg) in the Dreaming City from memory, or messed up the top design and didn’t feel like fixing jt (understandable tbh). Though, the [Warframe one](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/007/780/718/large/josh-dina-towerrender1.jpg?1508453339) looks similar I guess, in that it’s also a white and pointy tower.
---
What SR were you using?
---
I lowkey thought that was the Plains of Eidolon.
---
Jokes aside, the painting and texture is really nice. The only real thing is other than the tower there isn't much to guide the eye, unless that was her intention.
---
Colour and blending is also really good here, fabulous job. Also, is this acrylic or oil?
---
Purely cosmetic use imo
---
Polaris lance with the eververse ornament from this season 
---
Exotics do not have rolls, everything else does
---
Yeah they have a preset ability but the rest is random roll
---
Yo playing at twelve o'clock last night and started up destiny 2 and bam so damn loud it woke my mother and she is a heavy sleeper that's how loud. *he he sleeper he he I the man who made this comment is stupid for laughing at just saying sleeper.*
---
Since Rivensbane seems like it’s gonna take a while to get the sparrow I started today on Chronicler, really hurts to know how far away from it I am with Truth to Power holding me back though (I only have 3 pages).
---
But I finished Variks and Cayde’s books today, which means the only RNG one I have left is Dreaming City (I’m on 5/10 for that one)
---
Yes they do. Forsaken changed this. 
---
Acrylic. And I think that was her intention, for it to be more of a broad landscape to find something new every time you look. 
---
Yeah ones you randomly get have random rolls, required collection book ones have static rolls
---

---
Thanks man! Might have given me a little idea for my Saint 14 tattoo..
---
The lack of jotunn on this thread is disturbing.  I cant get it out of my energy slot....nothing seems as satisfying.
---
I understand, I was also making a reminder because many, many people buy pets of any kind without knowing the tiniest bit about pet care. I was just saying that people NEED to do that regardless of what species, breed, etc. the pet is.
---
I had a White's Tree Frog, so I know how particular the amphibians and reptiles can be.
---
Now that I'm looking at them side by side, it kinda does look like a repurposed tangled shore helmet, it has that wasteland raider look to it. I feel uneasy when I use it too. Of course, its perks are broken, but also my titan looks like a doof no matter what shader I add. If there is any exotic that needs an ornament, it's the OEM.
---
Doesn't it only increase the cap to two? Sorry, Warlock Main :p

I don't get it

There's a pike on the third floor of the church?
---
150/6=25    &lt;-----  amount of powerful enemies you had to kill each match
---
75/5=15    &lt;-------  amount of blockers killed each round assuming the enemy  team sent in only small blockers
---
add 2 for envoys and 1 for boss
---
multiply results by 2 or 3 depending on the length each match, then add any high value target
---
The result would be 36 at the very least (this result comes from maximum amount of blockers sent, 15 smalls, 2 rounds including the envoys and boss, and no high value targets)
---
It would be possible even if you didn't see 15 small blockers per round. Albeit conditions would have had to be good for you and you were there to kill just about every powerful enemy. The result would probably be even higher if you include elites. The auto rifle kills and multikills are just ridiculous.
---
Then you know how hard it is to stand up 
---
Didnt Bandits with light killed her parents? Am I wrong?
---
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
---
Oh lawd indeed :o

You just retrieved it from collections and then closed the menu whole the acquisition notification was still there....?
---
I hit level 12 today and I have no idea what any post is talking about. I'm still happy when I find blue loot.
---
I do know one thing, though: Gambit is apparently a game mode for griefing people with my incompetence. 
---
Same here !
---
It allows you to have 2 charges at once, but things that recharge your knife will still only recharge one at a time. If you throw both knives you’ll need to wait for it to recharge 2 times to get back to 2 charges.
---
New perk for auto rifles makes them obscenely large and awkward to shoot.
---
+10 damage
---
-10 reload speed
---
-10 stability
---
-10 handling
---
Weapon uses all available primary ammo to make bigger ammo for said auto rifle
---
The way I understand how second charges work, it is not two free charges for one. You get to store a second charge - meaning you can then throw 2 knives. But it only charges one at a time. I’ve never had it work differently than this. 
---
Curated NoB is an orb making machine too
---
I just looted a god roll Right Side of Wrong pulse rifle (Steady rounds/ Outlaw/ Kill clip) which may stay on my energy slot for quite some time. Are there any recommandations for secondary kinetic weapon I may consider for boss fights or other instances where I cannot sustain kill clip? I am currently working on Legend of Acrius for the Power slot at the moment.
---
Once again thanks so much for the work. Love how everything is presented neatly!
---
Lol yeah I feel it. At least they got to the post Master. I'm not sure If they've always done that or not. 
---
Yeah but have you ever played xenoverse 2?

How bout we just wait for a good Pve gun( similar to sunshot) that has crazy pve quest steps.

Is the 5th of March the last day?
---
Seed of light should be guaranteed from completing the first encounter (Kalli) in the Last Wish raid. If it’s not dropping for you, I don’t know what to tell you.
---
For Gateway Between Worlds, make sure you use the offering to the Oracle only in the strongest curse week to visit Mara Sov via the portal that spawns, and open the chest in her throne room. Doesn’t work on non-strongest curse weeks.
---
Tbf warlocks helmets are designed magic-y so they all looks pretty dope (their ornaments are even better). But their exotic perks just cant compare to titans or hunters helmets (skullfort, oem, wormhusk, celestial...). I mean i’d love to be able to rock my stag helmet everywhere but its perk is wack.
---
So apparently all it is is half assed dlcs coming as mini dlcs so I guess forsaken and everything else were the last real full dlcs and the next one will be more like a premium scavenger hunt.....
---
agree
---
polaris godly
---
So true!
---
Cause in Cannon lore millions of guardians are dipshits, which, also happens to be the case in the game
---
eh i enjoy hardlight just because the unique effect it has...plus it does decent damage now that they buffed auto rifles
---
the only real problem it has is the fucking screen shake but u get used to that
---
Feel free to kill yourself
---
Swolegerspite
---
Okay i got that wrong but still i have turned in my Oracle offering in multiple times on all 3 levels of curse. I dont know what to do.
---
I see you made another one! This is great, you went over all the feedback and this is really cool
---
Dont get me wrong, i love destiny. But after playing since forsken release grinding my way from LL 1 to 615 i feel just like that game drained my life energy. PvP sucks mostly. PvE needs way more content, instead of repeating the same strike again and again. 2 months ago i stopped playing it for a while cause its just too time consuming. And soon we have again a higer LL... Then you can grind up to LL 700...
---
I wouldve preferred less LL grind (changing my equipment every 2-5 LL sucks) and more end game content in pve and pvp. Why put me again every 3 months on a grind of 1-2 months for LL. 
---
1 from story quest from ikora to fill up light, from from blind well, 1 from visit to mara. Either u didnt finish the milestone from ikora to get that seed or u bugged out getting it mara if u for sure for the blind well one. Those are the 3 ways to get the 3 seeds
---
Is the emote a random from engrams?
---
Ew
---
You assume that bungie wouldn't help but we should somehow be able to? Mara, blind well itself and Kalli are the 3 ways of getting a seed. If you don't know how to contact Bungie, TYPE IT INTO FUCKING GOOGLE!
---
Took me several weeks running of all dreaming city stuff to get all 3 of my 3rd seeds of light.
---
Games not broken, you just have bad RNG. Why not make a crypost with no paragraphs and half in caps, that's sure to help!

Whoa, guess I've been told. Thanks genius

Was it that hard? I've never raided but I'm putting together a team of someone with no D2 raid experience, one with some Leviathan experience but not completetion, one with a shitload of D1 Raid Experience, someone with little D2 Raid experience, and someone with a shitload of each. We wanna do Leviathan first and eventually move to Last Wish. Is Petras Run just with extinguish?

Im not touching this bullshit after Last Word quest and its painful to look at this game dies. Again. 
---
I always invade using a sniper with snapshot sights and if you can snipe you will take out their entire team easily
---
seriously fuck rahool 
---
Been there.  I have also been lucky and got put into a forge with about 1/8th HP left on the boss.  Easy win.  :D

Exactly what I did too for the dawning snowball emblem in year 1. You know how hard it was to ignore snowballs last dawning?

No.

Try the wishbringer from shaxx. Rapid fire shotgun with great rolls. 
---
Devrim gave me a minigun (Sweet Business) for a rep turn-in. &lt;3
---
first time doing this today, did it solo. was using skyburners for lulz so all the ammo bombs were just blowing up and when these guys showed up I just started shooting them. halfway through I had a prime drop in a tight hall and spent  2 mins shooting it wondering why it wasn't blowing up.
---
It's more likely that your intervals are too long.
---
I've found that 13-14ms works best. Lion Rampant and Dunemarchers help, as does lightweight frame weaponry and any other significant boosters to mobility.
---
Not that it matters, though, come next month.
---
As someone who  generally enjoys PvP on the PC, I've been waiting for it to be fixed for so long.
---
Imagine a random event with raid bosses and everyone could just help. No need to start it, just stop on by and lend your super. 
---
Ok. I’m light 560 so I will do that in the future.
---
I still think it's pretty easy, can't really point out one of the other challenges that is easier.
---
Just FYI you can find people to play the challenge with. That makes it much easier as it doesn't reset when you die.
---
The only issue with this quest that I found was the reggression part. It made PvP far less enjoyable, cause every time I died, I remembered the damn quest and that I lost progress with it. Personally, I would have preffered a quest like: Get 500 kills in Comp with a HC where I would only need to build towards it and not give a flying fart about dying.
---
Got my my first wipe with the Ikelos HC... no, not sleeper.
---
It's not a definite advantage though. I've shot people out of blade barrage using golden gun before. I've also gotten way more kills in both pvp and pve using the new way of the outlaw than way of a thousand cuts. And way of the sharpshooter is amazing when combined with Celestial nighthawk to drop any boss - many also prefer it in pvp as it lasts longer so you have roam time although only having three shots.
---
Its Core Terminus. The one by the braytech spawn. 
---
So guild wars 2?
---
I actually had OEM and Crest of alpha lupi drop within 5 mins of doing that adventure the other day
---
Gambit is a good way if you enjoy it. Have fun and get your seeds at the same time. Otherwise core terminus is faster than leviathan 
---
That might be one to, the one I always used was the canal one on the other spawn, mada’m subterranean or something, you can jump on the bridge from a rock and then from the bridge you jump onto the chest area and the boss spawns 
---
Blast furnace has more range.
---
11/10 best A.i
---
Oh yeah that ones great too.
---
Lost a primeval melt off this way, I was so mad
---
I should report them to the IRS
---
I’ve watched this a few times and am still confused—after your 3 kills with GG there are still two players listed as being alive on the enemy team according to the HUD at the top. That was just a visual bug, right?
---
God I hope so. I’m trying to honestly get my Temptation done and this just doesn’t feel right. 😥

A week and two days. Do it Monday, sometime the next reset, and then the following Tuesday.

That's why I blade barrage'd her with extreme prejudice. Fuck her, fuck her bombs, fuck the spider and fuck the shore!
---
20% is not a lot. 30% maybe would be
---
i like th forsaken theme, i think it sounds better on the tangled shore though
---
I’m assuming you have the seed from the story, where did your second seed come from?
---
same here man, i killed the enemy and got real excited.  then realized it was a bomb.  felt good to kill that trickster
---
I usually just snipe people. No heavy or super needed
---
At this point I just expect it to blow up whenever I see an exotic but I have only done the quest once but now if I see an exotic I expect it to blow up🤣
---
I was today years old when i found out about this, no idea why this never crossed my mind. have an upvote
---
Shaxx, I already took the Vow there’s no going back 
---
I was under aware of that my dude thanks for telling me now I have to go look to see if I can figure out what the third one is. 
---
have you seen blueberries invading with 10 motes when those 10 motes are what you need to summon the primeval? especially when the other team has practically 0 motes on hand? Some days i just don't have a good time in solo queue
---
What platform are you on? If PC your paying $40 for Forsaken but the base game was FREE for a while.
---
PS4 has forsaken on a nice discount now, the fact you think paying for DLC that started commi g a year after the game launched as an expansion pack is bad is funny.
---
Also forsaken is $40 in 1 year a $10 per month fee is $120 triple the cost of the DLC.
---
It’s not pay to win it’s pay for more content and activities no forsaken means you don’t get LW and SOTP so the only light level that matters is invasion in Gambit and Iron Banner  there are Y1 guns that compete in all other activities IE Crucible if your going meta Ikelos SG ( or Hawthorns SG if you don’t want to include free DLC1 and 2 ) and Inagural Address pulse will hold their own against meta guns
---
Bungie doesn't give a crap. Honestly they probably get a cut of the profits.
---
The first time I invaded was unintentional due to phalanx. I was doubly confused. 
---
Yeah we had that, definitely got all the buttons as we had someone finish it solo which you can't do without jumping up into the safe platform up top
---
What pulse rifle is that?
---
That makes them best ever.
---
yes, it's from an older season though iirc so it's impossible to get atm unless Bungie does an even where you can get the "retired" cosmetics.
---
Nokris boss fight could be cool if they made it to where he constantly re-raises the enemies you kill as yoy fight him and things that make the bodies dissapear, like supers, grenades, and fusion rifles would permanently kill them thus lowering the amount of adds you fight in each phase
---
Bayesian MSU, just some random blue pulse
---
I got it recently. I never took it off until I got the 3 emotes I’ve always wanted. This is fine, victory, and the heart. Then i replaced confused with the draw emote. (Fun fact, you can press the emote button again with the draw emote to shoot the gun and end the emote.)
---
Is there like a special new way to get exotics, because other than quest exotics, I have legitimately not received an exotic in over two months and I don't miss a single daily or weekly. 
---
Wait, the ikelos hc is good? What is this sorcery?
---
😭 Cause is reminded me of the D1 pulses!  I wish it were purple! 😭
---
&gt; because that part and the thrall chase worry me the most about getting a flawless in this
---
There's the helmet that recovers health on dodge and crimson recovering health on kill, both work during that part. Also the little edges left and right of stairs (the upper part) where you can stand on are actually save spots - just like the middle you can jump on right when you enter the room.

well its a glitch but still its a energy weapon win win for everybody
---
IT SYNCS SO WELL! I LOVE IT!
---
Pretty nice! What did you use for your sketch?
---
Every single player of Destiny has the same opportunity to team up.  Don't point fingers at anyone but yourself for not teaming up.
---
Thanks for the NSFW tag 
---
First thing I thought to do with the tank piece was to use it as a weapon lol
---
Make sure you finish the mission as well.
---
When me and my friend started going for the catalyst, we kept stopping at the last chest then abandoning.
---
We found out that if you finish the quest, it rewards you with either 12 or 13 essence. 
---
Me and my friend sometimes spent too much time getting the chest and didn't have enough time to finish the mission. But you can just load back into the mission and finish it, you don't even have to go for the chest on the second go if you already got them on the first run.
---
Hope this helps! Goodluck and I hope you get it.
---
Awwwww, so cute x3
---
Again, I reiterate...  EVERY PLAYER of Destiny has the same opportunity to team up with others.  Don't point fingers at anyone but yourself for the choices you make.
---
The bloodcurdling shriek of despair when your team mate in gambit jumps into the portal with 15 motes and dies without killing any opposing guardians.
---
I literaly made the same comparison and complained about it to my friends last night. Wtf are we telepathically linked?!
---
Kinky
---
As a planet/area, yes. But IMO the Tower's original soundtrack is best.
---
it was initially a doodle on the side of a paper, i scanned it into my computer then used gimp to make it look nice
---
dreaming city got bigger problems than a curse with vicious guardians like you
---
Never get tired of more information.
---
We have so many archetypes these days.
---
r/yesyesyesno
---
u must not have played trials or comp in year 1
---
I have done the raid more than once and have still accidentally stepped on the plate ...
---
Pretty sure Nokris was a strike turned into a story mission since he destroys 2 crystals but only 1 has the node to destroy. Either way, its lazy
---
Everyday you're shuffling?

Reload mod...? Doesn’t exist. 
---
Nice! I did these in Autodesk Sketchbook, using snapshots from in the game to get a reference for the scale of the armor.
---
I once popped Dawnblade at the same time as an enemy, we both jumped in the air floating rightwards, we both shot Dawnblades at each other simultaneously (it takes 2 to kill another Dawnblade/super) and died simultaneously. I laughed so hard I died 30 seconds into my next life and was still laughing.
---
Lol I popped some poor hunter with a precharged Jötunn last night during his GG animation. It was really funny and also rather sad, poor guy. Would have killed him with any other super since he was at half hp already, still sad for him.
---
Lucky as hell i got masterwork chattering bone three times in a row
---
Did you mean Wrath of the Machine: Wall Segment?
---
Well, keep it up then!
---
Eternity's Edge is the one
---
Some people don't fuck with comp much or at all. "what do you want them to do?" Fucking spell it out clearly lol this isn't hard my dude. It's not that "there's no pleasing some people" it's that this is an extremely easy fix for a fairly large oversight. All they need to do is clarify in the text description.
---
thx for your input
---
That's some enemy AI malfunctioning right there...
---
Is this Spicy Devils or Best Devils?
---
Play during peak times for your time zone, that's when there seem to be the most "casual" players in my experience. Use long range weapons and stay behind your teammates. While in matchmaking, if you see the number of players suddenly jump up by 6 all at once, exit and reenter matchmaking so that you will not be matched against a team of 6. 
---
Why do NPC guardians get to use supers back to back anytime and we only get to do that in mayhem
---
The only advantage they have is communication. Blueberries can hop into fireteam chat if they want, which removes that advantage. Most solo queuers don’t, but that’s not Bungies fault. Get a team of your own if you want guaranteed communication.
---
Like, I get where you’re coming from (except for the whole “remove countdown” part - the only flaw I see is that it lasts so darn long). But I doubt the population could really support separated queues. Comp wait times already can be long as it is.
---
that's gold right there.
---
They did. She's still basically a stowaway in the fortress of her sworn enemy. Imagine some asshole you don't even know runs over a family of squirrels with their car, but one survives. But this surviving squirrel swears vengeance on all humankind, and in order to exact this vengeance hides in your basement for six hundred years and when you come down to say hi and ask its name, it tries to claw your eyes out. 
---
Outlaw is either max or just overwrites all other reload perks. Tempered Metal x3 does nothing to increase Outlaw's speed
---
I can't remember the name, but it's the one with a gyroscope in the handle.

---
Just did it on my last run lol. But gotten to a point where Kalli can be a shitshow and we still get by. 
---
Shuro continues to be problematic tho. 
---
I don't know how this helm made it past play testing...
---
&gt;!Part of Riven's wish was to Take a Vex mind that is basically trapping the Dreaming City in a time loop.!&lt;
---
Every armor piece is class specific, not just exotics. Aside from the three swords other commenters described, every weapon can be used by every class. 
---
Are you gonna cry all day, crybaby? 
---
Yeah I’m nearly at 100% so hopefully I’ll finish it soon I guess 
---
I believe you can do it with hunters as well actually! If i remember right both Cammycakes and bakengangsta have videos where they worldline teleport into golden gun and cover stupid distances with it. I’m not sure how it’s done though bc I play on ps4.
---
You can't make it, it just happens randomly      /s
---
Journey is the best song in the destiny 2 soundtrack imo
---
Ouch...but I feel shooting a bad guy would be better than Tank n Spank. Right?
---
“Yeah not cool guys stay off the plates” 
---
*no one suspects a thing*
---
NSFW
---
absolutely love translation theory 
---
Mods all stack. You'd wanna go for the Transcendant Blessing mods on your armor, for the last wish raid. Although they don't help with other raids :/
---
Way of a thousand cuts is good for add clear. Especially with shards of gallanor. However, for "most" raid boss fights, you want Bottom tree golden gun with Celestial Nighthawk helmet.
---
If you use your "way of a thousand cuts" super against riven, you'll pop out all her eyes and wipe the raid. You need a little more precision. As for the final boss fight in Scourge of the past, you'll be too far away from the boss to get any use out of it.
---
As for weapon loadouts, I don't think anyone gives a fak what you use. What matters is your heavy weapon. You'll be using it to burn down bosses. I'm pretty sure everyone has adopted the Cluster Bomb strat for Riven, so get a Rocket Launcher with the "cluster bomb" perk ready for that raid. 
---
Otherwise rockets are not very good/efficient when it comes to DPS. I recommend an LMG. Whisper of the Worm Sniper Rifle would be a fantastic heavy weapon to use for raids if you have it.
---
Have you checked your inventory?
---
Have you unlocked both the Volundr and Gofannon forges already? You can only work on unlocking one forge at a time. 
---
IKR
---
Can't escape this bullshit..
---
It could maybe work if you did it like the divisions trading system. Only allowing you to trade an item with the people who were in your squad when you got it. Then for destiny only allow drops so people can't just pull from collections and trade. and make sure if it is the first time the gear item is acquired by a player trading will remove it from the collections tab .  Personally don't see a reason to implement something like this though
---
no cluster rockets in sight therefore its clearly fake.
---
That's clever, AND literal.
---
Some areas might, but I live in a metropolitan area in the US and in evenings I still will have 5 min queue times sometimes in comp, or rotate with the same 10-20 players. It’s hard to say since we don’t actually get to look at most of the hard data on engagement, but splitting the population further is imo a valid concern, not just an excuse.
---
Acrius got buffed recently didn’t it. Haven’t had a chance to bust it out yet. 
---
I figure this is a pretty good place to ask, so why or new / inexperienced players called blueberries?
---
Honestly the upcoming focus on gambit is gonna make me stop playing 
---
Yes. I finished Mercury and Mars in probably 1 or 2 afternoons each. There's not a ton there in either location if you're looking to just see the story and the adventures 
---
If the stars align, you can kill up to 7 guardians. Kill 3 and if somehow get the rest of them with any AoE super, only if the stars ever align. I killed 5 with Blade Barrage by accident when they spawned on the delayed explosion after the Blade Barrage tweak, and that is when I realized I can kill up to 7.
---
Great job Meks 
---
Same reason fighting lion is a primary grenade launcher. It's an exotic and it's supposed to be powerful. Like above, just learn to counter it. Changing the item isn't always the answer. 
---
Why did you post this here?
---
Im im the middle of osiris and i want to start forsaken could i go back and finish
---
The unknown is Izanagis, I have lemon and it still shows up for me
---
I have a buddy who did something similar. Killed 3 with Bygones, the last Guardian ran to spawn. The 3 respawned and he Blade Barraged them all. 
---
What sale? I havn't got anything in Battle.net...?
---
Yes, this is not related to Destiny 2. This sub is for related content. 
---
In the Scourge of the Past raid lair, during the boss dps phase everyone is given a buff (continuous, angular, or parallel) and they have to match with the other person who has their buff to do more damage and to not die. To accomplish this, people use a triangle with a buff at the top or bottom (in this case angular) and the other 2 at left and right (continuous and parallel). The buffs are also assigned a shape because in the previous encounter, you receive buffs from terminals showing the respective shape (continuous = circle, angular = triangle, parallel = square)
---
Yes, you can start Forsaken as soon as you reach level 30, and the other campaigns will be exactly as you left them. 
---
Saw this yesterday, its unreal all over a fucking handcannon 
---
Thank you for letting me know
---
In scourge of the past, there are three buffs that players can receive during the final boss damage phase. It will always be three pairs. The three buffs you can get are angular, continuous, and parallel, angular being a triangle symbol, continuous a circle , and parallel a cube.
---
If, during the damage phase, two players stand next to each other with the same buff(its random) they get a huge damage increase. The way the community has organized the locations for where to go if you have a certain buff is, from left to right, continuous, angular, parallel (C.A.P.).
---
Theres always one fuckhead who hecks it up tho. 
---
Scourge of the past positioning. Each team member get a debuff(Continuous, Angular, Pararell) having 2 people the same debuff, if these 2 guys stay together they get a damage buff, if not you get tethered (i believe(?), haven't done the raid yet) 
---
Thats why i run Nova bomb its effective and hilarious !
---
Invader kills dont equal success, keep being a loser
---
thats exactly what happened
---
You got Bergusian Night after First Encounter. I hate you. (Not really. But WEEEEHHHHH).
---
You didn’t even check the perks.
---
Rule 2. 
---
The last mission is pretty tasty. Bring a friend.
---
What's the issue? You don't have to pay off you don't want to
---
You get used to it after a while
---
I don't think it's wrong what they are doing. I mean you have free choice as to whether you want to accept. They are providing a service. If no one pays for it then they earn no money. But if people are willing to pay. Then so be it.
---
I surprise myself with that outlook as I help people through raids and whisper and nightfalls and never ever charge. I just do it to be friendly. But I don't hold it against people who do charge. I mean I pay lawyer if I need legal advice. Or a mechanic if I need my car fixed.
