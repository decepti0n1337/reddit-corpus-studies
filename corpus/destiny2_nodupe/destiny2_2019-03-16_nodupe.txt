You’re argument is so convincing that I have changed my mind.
---
Yes. Imo that’s the god roll

HEHEH WE WARLOCKS GOT A FORSAKEN EXOTIC THIS TIME HEHEH
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
\*sob\*
---
if you're talking effectiveness maybe, but stat-wise they're very different, my bad for not mentioning that first
---
I got 1k on my 56th run. :D
---
It is when people who don't care about winning are going into comp for thorn
---
Thorn was my very first exotic weapon. I also had the voidfang vestments which allowed me spawn with a fully charge grenade and because that grenades used to be an easy 1-shot, I was guaranteed a kill every time I spawned. I got the entire crucible section done in 1 sitting. 
---
Used the very same grenade launcher with the very same perks, shot the sector boss in the EDZ and... inflicted approximately 5-7% HP dmg. It does roughly x10 more damage than a single crit from Blast Furnace burst.
---
I have a theory relating Xol and Riven to an extent, glad to see others are seeing some connections, albeit they're different than what I came up with. But still, I'd say my theory is a good read, although you don't have to (Talking to everyone here, not just who I'm replying to) *Shameless plug~* 
---
My friend figured out a way to get the tank in the machinist mission up into the boss fight
---
You just completely rolled over the fact that ppl just want to solo que into comp and dont want to play against a 4 stack. It has nothing to do with skill when their skill level is much higher and their mmr should just put them with equal enemies rather than with the glory rank. The fucking glory rank at the end means nothing, you can exceed far beyond the glory cap. Infact even when you deny everything about my statement and opinion , its still the worst matchmaking between all comp egoshooters out there. Period.
---
thanks now i have a new challenge to figure out
---
oi, The Drifter is the one keeping Cayde's Idea alive.
---
Nah bro it was getting instantly crossed mapped by sleeper and the prime evils health going from 100% to 0% in 3.5 seconds
---
I took my Thorn/BB/Shards with full super mod into Comp today to end some thornless mans whole career.

Cool map and design, HORRIBLE for invading. Too easy to camp in buildings and hide from invader, or snipe on spawn. 
---
Honestly that’s how it was when I went to shit on all the plebs using Ikkelos hc and kindled orchid, boosted me up to 2000 glory so thanks :P
---
Whats the Masterwork? But already godly. 
---
Fucking SPOILER. Ive already seen it but maybe others haven't 
---
...this made me chortle
---
I. LOVE IT.
---
Grats, I used that + thorn and thing that gave axiom bolt 3 things, to sweep trials for a few weekends. 
---
The image of that quest step is an override frequency. You must complete that quest step, which counts as an override frequency, because you can only have one at a time. 
---
LE VAGABOND

The name says it all.

Whisper mission below the green room theres infinite shadow thralls spawning
---
This is so wrong i can't even, nor do i want to, explain it here. Are you on the discord? Debunk time. 
---
Alright thanks, sorry Ima noob 🤕
---
No. 
---
Thorn in one, Last Word in the other, play them both :P
---
This. Wiping or delaying the team is really all the same. If your team is even within striking distance of a win, go for it.
---
lmaooo it took you that long? Everyone else got it day 1. Asssss.
---
Just two quests, what's the point?
---
Invitation of the nine
---
Each comp win gives you 3% completion and each quickplay win gives you 1% I believe, it's not so bad.

Excuse me, but *#WTF*

He warns you of drinking Scorn blood too
---
I've had plenty of times where someone quits after we lose (they were using a goddamn pulse rifle, it was inevitable), then they rejoin us while trying to get a different match.
---
yeah after you do the invitations of the nine bounty
---
*Insert wetf that one song is here*
---
The fan base, the fan base never changes...
---
It's the curated roll. Just not curated lol must have different mag and barrel options but it's one of the best perk combos you can get
---
when lagging in a game actually gives you advantage over others
---
I love pve but nothing is better than Crucible especially Iron Banner. 
---
hell yeh
---
I'm pretty sure its actually the tractor cannon's older brother i believe the name was ahhhhh fuck you
---
That IS a valid point, but the gun came from D1, ncs if that changes anything tho
---
I think id work on a different second perk bc that wouldnt ever happen just cus of raids
---
Yep.  That and Edge Transit.
---
Heath dissapears
---
That's a hard maybe but I can almost guarantee you they will now xD
---
in the raid, revive by this weapon would still cost tokens... i forgot to write that down in the description
---
BAN AIMBOTTERS
---
I had two very miserable matches in a row like this. I couldn’t hit anyone and they were glitching all around me
---
I’m literally trying to get both malefecense and thorn at the same time 
---
My friend and I would always get Banshees into that final Halo 2 room
---
you u what, might wanna check dat internet connection
---
But that thing...
---
*thrall that kills you in 2 hits*
---
It scares me
---
56?\~!?\~?\~?\~?
---
I did after the match, I was 260 down 10 up :/
---
They drop randomly when you finish and then claim a completed daily bounty
---
Well this is just me but maybe instead of reviving someone it increases recovery of a teammates shields by like 5 and gives them a overshield, but only when  their shields breaks ie; red health
---
I really like this idea and all exotics are appreciated!
---
You may approach it...
---
... once.
---
Warning, this is much too creative.
---
I'm just going to upvote this and hope it gets to the first page somehow
---
Dunno, been playing since December 2017, and I've not seen a single exotic engram, so.
---
Finally
---
Him
---
L E G E N D .  HAHA HE DID IT !
---
Now if the Queen ever returns, you have the opportunity to take her for a spin or kill her
---
I just wanted  a better d1 
---
I've been doing this with Ghosts since Halo 1. 
---
I'll break it into steps.
---
But first! What you need - a warlock with top tree dawnblade, the exotic chest piece Wings of Sacred Dawn and preferably 5 super mods and preferably burst glide. 
---
1) Launch the Last Wish raid.
---
2) Go to the wish wall, you'll find a video or guide to that easily. You get there before the 1st encounter so you can do it solo easy peasy.
---
3) Enter wish 5. Equip an auto for this, it's the wish with snakes in all the corners, birds down the verticle middle and dragons down either side of the birds.
---
4) This takes you to the ogre encounter. I wanna call it golgaroth but I think that's Kings Fall. 
---
5) Look over the giant chasm behind you. The landing on the other side of that massive jump is where you are gonna get to. It looks crazy but it's easy.
---
6) Wait for super. (Mods help here)
---
7) Sprint and glide off the edge towards the landing, try get some distance but don't wait till the end of your glide or you might die from the invisible barrier.
---
8) activate super
---
9) Spam B or Circle or whatever it is on PC to constantly activate Icarus Dash, this will naturally pull you up and fire you most of the way across
---
10) when your super runs out, Icarus Dash will start going on a cooldown of 5s. This is where Wings of Sacred Dawn come in. Keep ADS-ing to constantly activate the exotic and hover in place.
---
11) activate Icarus Dash when the cooldown is up. This will fire you forward a bit.
---
12) spam ADS.
---
13) Icarus Dash
---
14) Repeat until you get to the landing.
---
15) Run down to the right, once you are outside you are in the area of the first chest. I'll let you take it from there.
---
16) There is another way to get another chest following on from that. But I'll save that for a pm. Or you you can try work it out from there. A hint: you still need dawnblade.
---
More handcannons and shotguns please. We need balance! 
---
The thorn quest calls for void kills &amp; hand cannon kills, and the Ikelos HC is void, so, it’s more efficient 
---
Ahh I see it
---
I just finished EP and got to that point of the quest. It suddenly made sense why everyone was using it 😑
---
Bro I am straight up not having a good time
---
Go Figure...
---
Yeah about that
---
I only want Geomags idc about the rest!
---
No they fixed it so 4 stacks never have to play against 4 stacks.   Just like reddit wanted. 
---
It’s a blast, once I got bygones and telesto. 
---
Ah good times
---
Oh cool thanks bungo 
---
I was so happy getting my first sword 
---
*G O L D*
---
Hey, there's still an exotic quest to look forward to, for non-annual pass owners. And you can check out the cutscene on youtube, it actually got leaked like a week ago.
---
You can see all of them and their requirements in the triumphs tab.
---
I remember having some insane kills with Truth but this is next level 
---
Its true, I am a level 20 and I just hit my most amount of kills in a game, I was kinda proud and surprised at the same time. I've never been good at PvE in games, ever, So the fact that my team one and that we held a power play for a little over 20 seconds was pretty impressive. *(I like saying I'm a level 20 because level 20's never go in the crucible and I'm always the only one in the entire match. Never been paired with at least another level 20.)*
---
The facebook group I'm apart of is only complaining  say it way to hard or why does it need to me in pvp. I remember having my sister who at the time was a pvp god get it for me back in D1. The fact I can get it now in d2 makes me so happy. I feel all these pvp challenges helped me become a better player 
---
He’s referred to as “shadow” by Bungie as in Shadow of Yor, but it’s widely agreed upon that he’s just the player character.  
---
the fact that you're able to get it there tells me that bungie doesn't mind where you get the sparrows
---
Happy cake day!
---
all this is fact.. which is the sad part
---
but to bash the higher skilled based part of the community into being to the "bad guys" is just ignorant... so is making the assumption that people have no lives or jobs to be good or have a competitive hobby stand about the game.. if anything the more hardcore audience are the ones who care the most as they are more loyal and don't hop from one flavor of the month to the other..
---
if anything the reason the game is the way it is and the reason youre upset with how the community acts, by your logic is because of the majority itself.. which ironically is the side that triggers you, but the side that you apparently support at the same time..
---
as you said yourself the minority doesn't control, so that wouldn't make since that they are the main problem either
---
Take my upvote
---
I love how you can see Drifter go from "HAHA get fucked" to "oh fuck" 
---
r/destinymemes will enjoy this
---
thank you fellow random person
---
Ah glad to see I am not the only one who brings sparrows where they should not be! You are a true guardian
---
Sorry, but I genuinely don't understand your logic
---
This.  Played Crucible for two hours tonight, Quick and Comp, and only got to 13%.  This is going to be a grind and PVP just isn't my thing.  Brutal.
---
Queue &lt;bro, I'm totally not having a good time&gt; meme here. 
---
U welcome 
---
But there are only five of them. Oh… 
---
I think I'll prob look at using Ringing Nail, or at least trying to farm it. I like the auto rifles in general. I a los might try to farm NoB, although that seems like it'll be tougher 
---
I like the idea of scout/sniper, but I was playing around with that today and found the ranges slightly too close to each other. Situations where I might have used the sniper, I just stayed on my scout. 
---
Got that from dismantling another gun and thought it would work well here.  Just thought I’d ask if there was a better combo.
---
Always.
---
MMO communities in a nutshell.
---
Toaster gun better
---
Give toaster gun
---
Rip anyone you play against
---
love.
---
I have every exotic but this one and two other for the titan. He doesn't get as much love from me as he should. But after farming 100s of ghost fragments I'm starting to think this one isnt for me.
---
You should be able to for the Recluse since it’s based off of a triumph which is account wide. Not sure about Luna’s. 
---
With the exception of Sturm and Drang, all of those weapons are "I only think it's good because a video/post told me it's good" choices.
---
The stuff people use when they're not adventurous enough to try anything they haven't been killed by or talked   
---
 at about.
---
I see. Thanks 
---
Beautiful
---
Exact thing happened to me today
---
It only opens on 3rd course week which is now.
---
I would like to say i'm "guy who didn't know raids are do fucking long"
---
I think the main point on them is that they roll with an extra random perk you can select  but it's still completely rng for what it'll be 
---
yeah and even last wish ive had people with 10+ completions and they didn't know how to do the encounters. nothing wrong with that its just funny.
---
Yes, I knew the modifiers before I even got to that step. I’m not sure why you’re getting salty with me, I cleared the fucking strike with only one team wipe since the thralls snuck up on us, hence why I suggested they use the strategy we did. You clearly didn’t read them or you don’t have Thorn yet.
---
Took me three days to do the entire quest once I had the time to play a bit. I promise it’s not that bad. Do nightfalls for the first part. But honestly, if you are so salty about crucible don’t even try. You need over 200 void handcannon kills anyway. 
---
It’s not worth it to be toxic here. I think everyone understands that crucible isn’t for everyone. If you don’t want to do it no one is going to judge you. Don’t be a dick though. 
---
Can we combine stones and vape guy to add "Tired guy who only speaks when absolutely necessary"? Because that's me. Its not that I'm not speaking because I don't know what to do or am awkward, I've just been around people all day and just wanna shoot shit
---
Let's be honest. Malfeasance looks infinitely better, which is all that matters
---
Vanilla or chocolate 
---
Except the development team who now has to double the amount of time and money allocated to this quest because you refuse to play a major part of the game. 
---
I’d have to agree with that, even if I’m a PvE main. It’s fun to progress yourself towards better aim especially on pc and thinking before acting. Building loadouts is fun too. Right now I’m in 38% in weaponize the unknown, I might just forget quickplay and get straight into comp
---
Those first two expansions packs makes your statement seem pretty far from the truth.
---
Come on man you’re embarrassing yourself in front of the wizards. 
---
Actually never seen anyone with this title. Well fucking done!
---
Big congrats on that one! Will prob never have that:/ soloplayer here stuck with Lunas only ;D
---
I know the feel, I really want chromatic but I'm on vacation til Wednesday :'(
---
nah titans are near useless in reckoning so sentinel is the best you can play. you can block incoming damage and buff allies at the same time. nobody struggles on the first wave and you really don't need hammers to deal with thralls, and the majors take every single hammer to kill just one.
---
Nope 
---
I’ve been using the collections version. Unfortunately it has primary ammo finder which is useless. Not a big deal I just would have expected it to have traction at least once
---
RNG gave me both the ghost and ship on my first last wish on my titan
---
Needless to say,my fireteam was mad
---
Have checked. Can confirm that it will not let sparrows through, unfortunately. 
---
Launch Leviathan and bring up your ghost it will show
---
Okay i have to know how to do this
---
I hear you brother. I too endure the wrath of my clan.
---
I learned...while playing Battlefield 3 and screeching every profanity I could think of at the TV after every single death...that the Kinect had a mic and it was always on.
---
Just doing regular daily activities for powerful gear
---
"too easy to get power" damn I wish I had that kind of time.
---
Sent!
---
I got it done in about 4 hours switching between the line, kindled orchid, last word and ikelos based on the game mode and map. Worked pretty well
---
I member. 
---
Yes, getting thorn as a hunter made me want to die 
---
WHERE'S THE RELIC IRON, WHERE'S THE FKN RELIC IRON!?!
---
I love knowing that this was just the base tracking on all launchers, truth was sick in trials #ogrockets
---
Stoner in my own right
---
i can feel this
---
This is on you. The season just reset so some people with nf/lunas are at the bottom of glory just like you because they havent had a chance to play or whatever yet. And there is another pinnacle weapon. You are going to have to beat people with it to earn it anyways so quit crying. 
---
I would very much enjoy seeing this each week 
---
Im chill just sating you bought crimson and did the quest for mida
---
I have several questions
---
It should be at drifter
---
Congrats
---
Much cooler - nearly perfect 
---
You have been, for the past few months
---
I don't have nf or Lunas and I completely agree with you on this.
---
Even if it wasn't, you get those weapons from comp, they've clearly played enough comp to have them so they enjoy it. Why would you ask people to stop enjoying something because you don't like that they're doing it. 
---
I personally haven’t, but now that I know this I’ll keep looking each week, thanks 
---
Well that’s what I thought I went to him and nothing just the usual lines he says and that’s all I get 
---
Person who just screams in mic, person who doesn't speak English (poor English counts too), person that is self depicting the entire game, person who never takes responsibility for their mistakes, I've only watched videos but I know what to do, and the rage quitter
---
Carried lol
---
Congratulation new blacksmith
---
I did the entire thing in one day with the ikelos but the telesto is a good option if you're okay with going a bit slower.
---
Did in fact drop 30 kills in a game of comp the other day and only got 2%. I enjoy PvP, but this step seems a bit excessive.
---
That's a bit odd, since drifter has presented the quest for me on all characters. Maybe try doing some bounty for him, maybe he'll opens it up. Not sure if one's supposed to be 650+ or something for it, but I doubt that.
---
A camera for Xbox that suckered more dick than a street hooked on broadway
---
r/entitledpeople
---
Definitely play comp while using the Ikelos hand cannon, Even if you lose every match it’s way faster to progress.
---
I did it yesterday and most people were using it too, after a week or so I’m sure it’ll be back to normal so get in quick
---
As much as I want to say that you're wrong and everyone has their opinion, I'm a man who has achieved a maximum of guardian III rank on competitive and I did the entire quest with the ikelos HC in 3 hours. I feel like it's just alot of complaining.
---
Serious, look up the lore page yourself
---
was that a spoiler? it looked like a spoiler. ****
---
Oh man, flashbacks to King’s Fall. “Oh yeah I totally know this part no problem” - guy is hopping on other people’s plates and generally just getting everyone killed. I’ll take honesty over that every time - I don’t mind teaching people if they just tell me what they don’t know!
---
[Shhhh bby](https://i.imgur.com/GEosw60.png)
---
I'm over on that left side there.
---
Idk, a lot of people were saying where’s the spoiler tag, so I changed it to have that tag, even though it’s like the most minor thing ever considering how in the ViDoc we already saw this dude and Drifter together
---
Nice!
---
You can use any hand cannon and any void abilities, it doesn't have to be a void handcannon. Use what actually will work for you, instead of forcing yourself to use kindled orchid or ikelos just use a hc that you're good with and be your void class.
---
Phantomatic knives
---
I only have lunas but for my own opinion I like comp 10× better than quickplay. You mostly come up against people your skill, (mostly not always lol). But those maps aren't made for 6v6. Way too small. And the game mkde diversity is much better as well. 
---
I'm currently doing be Leviathan, can't see the challenge at all
---
where’s the guy who complains about solo queueing whilst having all the resources of LFG very available for him to use any time?
---
Worst thing was getting like 10 games of countdown in a row. Went from 0-2078 during my thorn quest though so almost have my recluse 
---
Well actually I don’t which is why I found it weird
---
Also he was the only one in the party that heard it so I don’t know
---
I did it to, i only couldn't do the pyramidion
---
"Damn what type of wine is this?"
---
"Ah, Jupiter flavour"
---
What kind of people fo you talk to my man?
---
Thats Why he needed motes
---
Its a bug. Been there since launch. 
---
Best of luck to you brother, I'm working on getting mine now!
---
Spectacular! I'm gonna try the same later! :)
---
Feel like this would look even better with the green handle and having the whole barrel the taken ornament, but this still looks neat.
---
The annoying vape guy :( sorry world 
---
I do it all the time. I sparrow right up to the Spider, or bergusia forge or anywhere else I can get to. 
---
I love getting sparrows where bungie doesn't want them
---
Basically Actium war rig and Sweet buisness
---
Yeah... I do remember. And also when everyone was getting hyped for the 3rd subclasses when we realized that there was an empty 3rd slot that wasn’t filled in the subclasses screen. Good times.
---
They're just like Captain America in Infinity War. He's there and sending mental support vibes, and after doing nothing for literally the whole movie/reckoning they claim they did the most by "protecting" the team
---
That doesn't help anybody. You're trying to get weapons that are used mainly in pvp. Why not try to get better in that gamemode. 
---
But Ada-1 is bae.
---
Hey let's go to the sub where people like something and act likes it trash, that will show them that thing they like isnt good......dumb
---
Yep like the fan that made you fly!
---
Easy peasy if you have Riskrunner. Arc yourself with a grenade and go to town.
---
"The Nine are watching."
---
It did the same thing for me with Festival of the Lost "Complete any challenge in the solar system with a Festival of the Lost mask equipped" but to fix that I was able to just get the Rahool mask from collections and complete it. But Crimson Days is different.
---
I've reached the point where I don't know what's going on anymore. 
---
Correct. It skips out content you haven't done to get you to forsaken 
---
Wait spacing out release is now a valid form of making an illusion to having content? That’s absolutely horrible. 
---
Let’s say they released 7 guns immediately and it took an average person 1 week to acquire all of them. That’s a gun a day. Say that they release 7 guns spread out across 3 months. That’s still just 7 of the 1 day’s worth of content spread out over 3 months. There isn’t actually more content. I don’t quite understand your logic, though if I’m missing something please do tell. I would definitely prefer being able to access content without some artificial time barrier and play with all of the guns and find a favorite.
---
Okay but look at the Roadmap, there’s two exotic quests. One for people with the Annual Pass, and one for people who don’t. Those of us who do have the Annual Pass have Thorn. That leaves one more quest for everyone, which will likely be Arbalest. If you go watch the ViDoc for this Season, the part where Bungie starts talking about the Revelry event, there’s a Guardian holding the gun. This is good enough reason to believe it’ll be free for everyone in the Revelry, a gun being “too unique” isn’t a good reason to believe it won’t be free. Whisper is one of the best weapons in the game and that’s free for everyone despite it being part of Warmind.
---
If you look up a weapon on light.gg, it will tell you the percentage of players that have found a weapon. As far as activities,idk
---
I'm so jealous I have never got it
---
According to the lore of the game, please tell me the purpose of the Crucible?
---
The problem is the comp playlist offers 2 rewards. 2100 and 5450. If you struggled or dont like comp, most people quit at 2100. So from 2100 to 5450 is a totally different grind. Its doable but very tough
---
Endgame pve: nightfalls, nightfall specific loot, raids, whole sets of armor and weapons, new reckoning, sets of armor and weapons.
---
Endgame pvp: 1 new gun a season and another one to work towards at 5450 if you haven't got it yet.
---
Source image?
---
Do you get sweatier than normal when wearing the armor?
---
Stoner for sure 
---
*Sound of bongs ripping on the mic, followed by a few choked coughs*
---
Lol don’t worry, a very small number of players actually PLAYED Trials. Most of us manipulated matchmaking to go flawless by having two teams of 4 queue up at the same time, and as we load into the match, one team would leave 7 times to give the other team a Flawless, then the teams would switch. Though it was lengthy, it required very little effort to get some nice loot.
---
Do you really want to know ? Hint : on the cinematic, it was revealed he was afraid shin was going to get him. 
---
That’s destiny lore. 
---
Though him being paranoid about shin doesn’t seem to match with what I’ve read about him. 
---
Honestly seems like when this character supposedly met his “end” he didn’t even try to fight back. He just let it happen. 
---
Once did kings fall with a guy who downed 3 bottles of jager beforehand, best raid of my life.
---
What ship is that?
---
Now that ia a nice shader 
---
That’s a nice format
---
Anyone know what armor the stranger is wearing? Leg armor that is
---
Thanks for the info man, I’m down to do that. You said you still play occasionally yeah? 
---
Leviathan. 
---
The Leviathan is probably my favorite location in Destiny. I love everything about it: the lore, the aesthetic, the characters involved, the American Ninja Warrior course.
---
I do have it! Will give that a try, thanks!
---
A snippet from The Nine cinematic from the first quest given by Xur this weekend. 
---
I think the quest requires 500 kills if not using a hand cannon, void, or being in comp it’s pretty long
---
chömp
---
Cool
---
This is questionable 
---
Is gambit the best way to get a gambit only weapon? 
---
You can still get it.
---
As a pvp player who doesn’t really push for power the strike is the same way for me
---
Stop it. Enough wierd ass photos making me question if I’m in the right sub 
---
I got Foetracer today and found a BA void hand canon with kill clip and drop mag in my vault. Even though it'll take some time it feels and works really good getting kills with.
---
They said they are working on it
---
Grind like your life depends on it. Forget your family. Forget your girl/boy. Grind man. Just grind. Welcome to Destiny.
---
It's a glitch. Bungie know about it. They just haven't fixed it yet. 
---
also when you check lost light as a subclass i think it comes up with the avatar of the last possible subclass per character type (warlocks gets arc, titan gets solar)
---
With a nice hint of flavor blasted pizza rolls
---
Yes.
---
I LOVED THAT SNIPER!!!
---
D'oh, I knew that didn't look right
---
Problem solved
---
That tiny fucker at the end of the raid was so annoying just to find out theres a million more robo clones
---
Le monarque can drop in any one of them jötunn only drops in bergusia you need to forge a powerful frame to get them so you have 2 shots at it in 2 week
---
With a high pitched yell.... Yup
---
Cant hear it
---
How do you get this??
---
I used to play with a guy who used speakers and everytime he was hotmicing we would tell him and he would respond like 'Oh yeah I'm just playing Skyrim' and then carry on completely oblivious to the fact that we didn't want to hear him playing Skyrim. We do not play with him anymore.
---
Meanwhile i get downvoted for stating that you can hit &gt;690 in the first two weeks, because people for some reason think getting above 670 is "bullshit" even provided a raid log / public profile. lol.
---
So much fun. It also is really good in crucible. 
---
Not to my knowledge other than them both being huge snakelike things. The ship is obviously way bigger.
---
Kill fallen, one of them will drop the quest
---
I just never use enhancement cores and do all scrapper bounties, and I still don't feel like I have enough to comfortably infuse with 50 cores.
---
Holyyyy cow
---
its quick play, who cares. U get literally nothing worth a damn for winning. So use whatever you want and get better with what you use. Luna/NF can be beaten. U gotta use cover and push a NF bc they aren't good at close range. Keep ur range against a Luna. Both of the guns are based off consecutive headshots. So keep moving. If u make them miss just one shot that luna/NF turns into a trust, not a good rolled one at that. Just focus on getting better at gunfights. Using cover, situational awareness. Record your matches and watch them and see where u made mistakes. Almost every time u die, it's your fault. Watching replays will show u how n why u died. Dont just give up and blame bungie. Try to work on your game. 
---
yeah I also like the look of it 
---
Eater of worlds is the only one I’ve done.

no blaming someone for something that doesn't meet your standard because it doesn't benefit or help you in youre mind is the epitome of selfish..
---
pretty ironic you say youre against exactly what you portray.
---
in your logic the fact youre mad at them for doing something that hindered you because you don't like it is selfish.. 
---
he we have a classic case of the pot calling the kettle black
---
Same place I got it from
---
Ballistics logs don't disappear any more, but unfinished gun frames turn back into either modulus reports or a ballistics log at the weekly reset. 
---
Ok i lol'd im a bad person
---
What was the gift the emissary gave him?  Access to the Reckoning?  Cause it flew right over my head when I saw the last part with his ship
---
Ok thanks.

[This page shows lists of upcoming things.](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47648) The "allegiance" quest in the second chart is what people are talking about. Players with the annual pass who complete the Gambit Prime introductory mission are offered a choice between siding with the vanguard and siding with the drifter. You can only choose one per character. 
---
That’s more like it. Save the souls who haven’t seen it yet 
---
But your thorn ain't fly
---
I saw a guy pick up Telesto from a random add in Levi. I got Lunafaction from a random add in this week's Petra story mission. On the other hand, I had to stumble on a random EP clearing party to get Borealis catalyst from the final boss. There's no rhyme or reason to any of this.
---
Nah Mate shaxx ist bae
---
Nah just ptsd from thralls 
---
You telling me you didn't complete all the random adventures on Titan?
---
The curated is pretty solid so look out for it. 
---
(Riffled barrel / Steady Rounds / Opening Shot / Rampage / Range Masterwork)
---
Notice knifes. To the team "SCATTER!" everyone runs all over the place like chicken dippers. Faster then hunter spins with blade barrage. 
---
Say it ain't so. I'm doing the allegiance, Ace if Spades, and  Thorn quests (all at once) and was going to take it in lockdown next week.
---
People were pissed about curse of osiris because it didn't really feel like they added anything. Playing that story, even the first time, just felt like more grind. We were grinding to get through it so we could go to the worst place to date (mercury), deal with that annoying Osiris zealot, and for what? A couple new maps in crucible? A couple new guns? More of the exact same grinding? I took a year long break shortly after Osiris, I just couldn't take it anymore. 
---
Aka... Alcoholic Unicron 
---
Hey, Zavala gave me my first Triple Tap/Rapid Hit/Tactical Mag sniper, whereas Drifter still has yet to give me a decently rolled sniper
---
Took mine in the blind well for the first time yesterday and it does pretty good there.
---
Yeah i dont have any of these
---
Hmmm... have you played prime/reckoning yet? Only other thing i can think of is they don't appear till you've completed (maybe even win) a round. 
---
Other than that im not sure. Sorry i can't be of any other help.
---
Wait actually? I’ve only done eater of worlds 
---
Guy hitting his vape, but I *usually* remember to mute my mic when I hit.
---
Dat THICC
---
It’s also velocity masterwork 
---
I thought the collection was like $60
---
TL;DR?
---
We're in the season of the drifter and yet forges and their items are still here and content is still viable/fun to do, so i see no reason for Bungie to remove them.   
---
Although, in this season, there is weekly (approx. 9 weeks iirc) invitations of the nine, which i think will not be available after those weeks, i'm pretty sure the other content will stay though
---
Per Cozmo the Notorious full set will only glow in combat situations so does not glow in social space like the tower or farm.

It will glow in all combat situations.

If you don’t enjoy it, then do other things.
---
However, if you want to grind exotics, it’s REALLY not that bad. Play quick play and stick with your teammates. I’ve been playing this game just a couple weeks and I did the last word pvp grind in around 6 hours. I got the Thorn quest up to 60% at the same time. 
---
I’ve played other MMOs where there were lots of things I didn’t enjoy doing (rep grinds, battlegrounds, whatever) but I wanted the loot so you just knuckle in and do it. 
---
It’s like once you get the ball rolling it’s never as bad as you think it will be. 
---
How so? Her powerful drops are only +1’s or so to my knowledge once you hit about 680. 
---
Did you complete the gambit prime intro bounty?
---
Awesome. Thanks! I’m just worried because I don’t want to have bought $40 bucks worth of DLC and have it all disappear later. I want to be able to come back way later and still enjoy Black Armory and Drifter and Opulence quests and such. 
---
It is if u buy it in the store without discount... I got mine on psn store for 20 bucks last year since i sold my old disc.
---
If u want to get a disc youll pay 10-30 bucks... On the psn store i would only buy with discount
---
We could do even better!  Let's give him his own day of the week! ... maybe Wednesday??
---
True I’m a little annoyed as well, but Im hoping this means they are planning on takin destiny to a new level and having morally ambiguous choices that while there is a choice that would be best for the city (forgiving uldren) but our feeling towards him may change our decision
---
Oh apparently you have to complete one Reckoning run. 
---
Thank you brother
---
Just check! Got the quest back. Thanks man
---
No, assedio non ci sta bene secondo me 
---
Yeah something like that would be amazing.
---
Better get ur cabal meat ready to beat em off
---
It would be annoying if it dissappeared. Its kinda lore-bound with how Gambit Prime, Reckoning, Forge and the other things work, so removing them would also block immersion for people, not just by "man i missed x weapons"   
---
Oh really? I haven’t seen Artist used much in Prime. Might have to try it out now since I usually run Sentry 
---
Lore wise that's what shin malfur is doing right now. Yes part of the shadows of yor killing those who go too far
---
To be fair probably about 1 percent of the warlock player base has it so far
---
I know this i was just making a joke
---
But yea that little arc soul buddy is nasty good
---
Lucky us then
---
I’ve only used it in crucible with Thorn cuz it gets ‘em nice and low
---
Nice nice they are my favorite exotic now to be honest
---
I dont have thorn yet but my friend said "hey, I'm about to start the last quest, want to help me? I could probably just 1 man it but you're on" I made the mistake of trying to help...
---
Any advice for the strike. I’m at. 370 and struggling with the end of it with the witches
---
If already have the tier 2 synth the drifter should have the bounties available to upgrade the synth again...it'll show a purple synth as 1 of the rewards 
---
10 runs??! Not only are you super late (as you admitted), but I got mine AFTER 25. It's been two months since. And the only thing I need for Rivensbane is the sparrow. NO SPARROW SINCE THEN. 
---
Dude I’m at 160 I can’t even kill anything 
---
xbox one?
---
Spike grenades + aggressive frame does an outrageous amount of damage. Like, stupid high damage. Go test it on any Wanted lost sector boss, you'll see.
---
*Laughs In global warming*

sorry to hear your disappointment man, may Cayde protect you in your travels

Can't get FF on Bygones.

Guess I won't ever understand what is wrong with Sunshot Shell. 
---
Thanks , i will try it ! 
---
Okay then that would be fine
---
poor Banshee :(
---
Ok , i will have a look! Thanks
---
That's just luck and control is meant for Quickplay. Control is competitive is a stupid idea to begin with, seeing as you know.. Its competitive. 
---
Not true, it came in an update last summer 
---
Give it a try! You might surprise yourself with how far you’ll make it power wise!
---
Thank you very much, I’m glad I could help!
---
wuh?!
---
It costs 10 cores T\_T
---
People just don’t understand how power milestones work, and how if completed in the right order, how it can maximize your power level overall. On my main, I hit 692 power on the third day of the new season :) 
---
Mine have gotten way better, 1-3 minutes usually.
---
Original Xbox one
---
Thank you very much!! Some people love their main and that’s okay! Sometimes it’s okay to take things slowly and to enjoy the ride! :)
---
Well for starters you have to actually land the headshot to do the full Celestial Knighthawk damage.
---
Also you gave him about a solid 7 seconds to line his perfect shot up while you stood there like target practice 
---
Oof. I think I have like, 70 right now from how many purples i dismantle, but 10 is still a pain to get rid of. 
---
Why is this still being asked?
---
Did one sentinel titan and one nightstalker hunter. Had one sleeper and and one hammerhead. We played slow and safe using void wall grenades and rally barricades. Just play slow and you’ll get it eventually 
---
No, the rank is retroactive 
---
Have you seen it!?
---
looks like a normal shell to me.
---
Oh well forgive me for assuming that my golden gun super would one shot someone that i successfully hit and being surprised and having to take a bit to realize it didn't. Surely if I had shot him with a single LMG round I could've been more assured of his death.
---
“The Recluse” 
---
It’s the pinnacle weapon for Season 6. It can be acquired by going to Shaxx and taking the red quest step for it. It requires you to complete a triumph by winning a lot of competitive games, and reaching 2100 Glory. After you do that, you can head back to Shaxx to claim your new pretty SMG. :)
---
Maybe this could be incorporated into some kind of Shaxx/Crucible week. With the rush of guardians jumping into some new crucible mode for some new crucible reward, Shaxx needs to rely on Ada-1 and Banshee-44 to forge guns faster then ever. We could have a quest building some kind of exotic supercomputer for him to store his memories and blueprints in, or scavenge something akin to SIVA minus the bad stuff to help improve him.
---
Drifter has been helping shin kill them
---
it looks like a floating decorative brick.
---
I know it's not an option for everyone as they can be a bit pricy, but I got an SSD for my Xbox and it reduced my load times by quite a bit. Hope this helps. 
---
no probs :)
---
Ah didn’t know that, my bad!
---
Control is in Comp as well. 
---
Once again, had you actually landed your shot he would have been vaporized.
---
However you missed the crit and he didn’t
---
I've had good luck with a better devils with explosive rounds, and a reload speed masterwork. Also backup mag mod on it, 14 bullets, pretty quick reload, I'm a fan of it.
---
What about the legendary Polaris Lance? Is that any good
---
I do things like this almost religiously, 
---
the easiest one I know is getting my sparrow inside of the Burgusia forge 
---
Hm, I haven't noticed a screen like that - I play on the PS4, so Destiny 2 is tied to my PSN account - which I can't log out of really, because that's the only account I have the game on :/ 
---
Once you get close to 300 you can do the Leviathan raid in orbit of Nessus, and the there's Spire of Stars and Eater of Worlds it think there too. 
---
Once you get close to 600 there's Last Wish in Dreaming City you unlock after Forsaken. And Scourge of the Past is on EDZ at I think 640ish.
---
They are more mechanic heavy than the first WoW dungeons, requires communication and coordination. Use an LFG tool to find a group, and watch a video beforehand to get an idea of what you'll be doing. They are a lot of fun! Good luck, hope that helps. 
---
it's a VERY strong pve weapon yes, decent in gambit as well
---
Golden gun has infinite range, also why wouldn’t they shoot the big golden beacon standing in the open 
---
Hunter Spectral Blades
---
Ok thanks I'ma use that and see
---
I did the same thing an hour after Ehroar showed how good it is.
---
No worries haha :)
---
And you missed and took a year to fire the first shot
---
There should be a option when you go to change character, there should be a option to switch account or profile. I only have one account/profile tied to my Xbox and PS4 too and this solved all my achievement/trophy issues
---
Add me, username is L_TheMcreeMain_L
---
I don't understand why sexual orientation has to do with anything.. 
---
I did land my shot I popped golden gun to make landing the shot easier than using my sniper. But  I guess now that I know golden gun is just a shitty sniper rifle i'll refrain from using it.
---
Why does it even matter if you're gay, straight, whatever? You're playing a damn video game dude!
---
 Copy. Thanks. It’s brutal 
---
Snipers are just long hand cannons.
---
It's in the lore and an adventure on nessus also mentions it. The machinery it uses is to crush down planets into raw resources and materials aswell as the ingredients for his purple royal wine. I'm pretty sure calus might mention it in one of the raids. 
---
&gt;Once you get close to 300 you can do the Leviathan raid in orbit of Nessus, and the there's Spire of Stars and Eater of Worlds it think there too.
---
Thanks for the info - can I get up to 300 without the DLC, then? Keep seeing references to 260 being the max light level in the initial release.
---
God dang it I made a typo. It should say Freehold not Fretehold lmao I'm rarted.
---
That's a statement.
---
other than that, Jötunn is probably the go-to secondary for killing majors, blockers, and invaders.
---
Do I gotta? 
---
Why not have a community? 
---
Haha just do it! 
---
It doesn’t but it’s nice to have communities within games 
---
How do i get the shader it’s goat
---
I’m mainly a pve player and I thought the crucible part of the thorn quest was very easy. I got 50 points in 2 matches did it in about 6 matches.
---
It doesn’t but it’s good to have a community :) 
---
*\*gets The Last Word... or Thorn\**
---
In case you didn't know, "proof" of alcohol is equivalent to twice the ABV% (alcohol by volume) in the US. The term apparently dates back to 16th century testing of alcohol to determine how high it would be taxed ([source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_proof)). Anyway all this really means is that the highest proof you could really get is 200, and the highest commercially available is 190. If anyone could figure out, though, it would be Calus.
---
Good work. I’m sure you’ll go far. Enjoy.
---
You’ve won some internet points.
---
Added :) 
---
Once you hit power level 260, continuing to go up in power level will become very slow. Before 260, any item drop will raise your power level. After, only a few select activities that refresh every week will raise your power level, so you cannot grind an unlimited amount of power at once. 
---
When you own Forsaken, any item drop will once again increase your power level until you hit 500, and then you must do specific activities to increase power level, but there are many more available than to base game players. 
---
Once you have completed the base game campaign (you will know because an area called the Tower becomes unlocked, and you talk to NPCs there to get quest rewards), and reached that power level, you will want to consider getting Forsaken. 
---
There is one raid available in the base game, Leviathan, that you can enter once you hit power level 300.  The power level of activities remains more or less the same as when they were first added to the game, so earlier raids have much lower power level requirements than later raids. All raids require 6 people, but plenty of players still do Leviathan, so it should be pretty easy to find a group. 
---
Same for PSPro. 
---
Is no one going to mention how easily he slides his chair back...on CARPET!
---
Until they inevitably Nerf it...&lt;sigh&gt;
---
Play competitive with Ikelos hand cannon even if you only kill 5 players you’ll still get more points than getting 20 to 30 kills in quick play. I got 20 kills in competitive clash and got 30 points towards the quest.
---
Are there only 5 because you're still waiting for the last guy to load in?
---
WHEn YoU SIdE WITh ThE VAnguaRD. Jokes aside I am level 20 and I agree.
---
Good luck on the strike part it’s a major bitch!
---
I meant it should be only comp
---
You have to finish the heroic version of Blind Well during the low and medium curse week.
---
K
---
When will that be?
---
I hate it as well, so I tend to only play it on weeks when Mayhem is available.  At least in that mode the advantages of wielding the current meta weapons is mostly negated.  And win or lose, the matches tend to end far more quickly so even when you are getting massacred it doesn't drag on as painfully.  Of course, you can't grind every PvP-locked weapon that way, but last time around I did The Last Word quest from start to finish in a couple of days and there's no way I could have possibly done it in regular Crucible.
---
True, however I solo'd up to the boss room and I'd highly recommend it to any Destiny player looking for a fun challenge. The end is borderline impossible to solo though
---
Next week and the following week. They rotate on a three week basis.
---
O ok thamks 
---
Next week is low curse week, which will bring a different champion. Then after that, it'll be mid curse week. Right now is the high curse week. That's why you're only getting one kind of champion. 
---
Post your results
---
Ok, thanks!
---
Nope. Best way that used to be with from Playstation Plus.. 
---
To get Cursebreaker, you need to have a pretty detailed understanding of the Dreaming City as an area. 
---
Things in the Dreaming City change on a three week cycle. To tell which curse week it is, look at the Dreaming City. If you don't want to physically travel there, look at where Petra is. It will also say which week in super tiny print at the top of the weekly reset infographic stickied to this subreddit every Tuesday to Friday.
---
The Strand: First, least cursed week
---
Divalian Mists: Second, middle week
---
Rheasilvia: Third, most cursed week.
---
The blind well has different enemy types on each of the three weeks. Week 1 is scorn, week 2 is hive, and week 3 is taken. When you succeed a Tier 3, you will hear your ghost say something about how "the primary well could use another boost," or a similar voice line. If you (or someone else) goes to the middle, there is an option to deposit an unstable charge of light. This starts Tier 4, referred to as Heroic. Killing each week's tier 4 boss gives you those achievements. 
---
Give the old man some love. 
---
That's good. That's really good.
---
15 bucks on amazon for physical copy.
---
Maybe. Thanks for the insight though
---
I can't see anything wrong with using 2 bows
---
I think the only thing it's lacking is damage &amp; consistency  Otherwise that subtree is really good all around
---
I’m trying to game share with my friend so he can get it but I just need the base game digitally because I have all the expansions 
---
Hmm I have the same bounty as posted but I can’t see myself getting 5 wins in a row. More like a lucky two only to lose 3 and reset progress 😅
---
Searching 'Destiny 2' in the Microsoft store shows me a result for the base game. I tried from both my Xbox and the Xbox app for Android. 
---
Are you not seeing this result when searching in the Microsoft store? 
---
My synthesizer disappeared from my inventory. I'm almost certain I did not delete it. Does anyone know how to get it back?
---
This is my standard way of eliminating Primes instantly. TC and Two Novas when the Slayer buff is at maybe 2 (you only need it at 1) and it dies instantly.
---
Somebody get this motherfucker into surgery for his back
---
So nearly looked over my should after reading that.
---
1 thermite grenade solves that problem.  But if you're up against a stack that knows how to chain blockers, this can be a death sentence.
---
Shoulda chose drifter, now dads coming for your tiny virgin asshole
---
Dude try it with heart of inmost light! If you actually use your super it's like Heart of steroids
---
20 inch barrel vs 6 inch barrel, that's why.
---
Either way still whiffed the headshot making this entire post irrelevant 
---
Do you understand how goldie works?
---
You keep empasizing crit as if you need a precision hit to one shot.
---
Top tree goldie is a 1 shot anywhere, period
---
Anyone trying to run bottom tree or nighthawk as a pvp loadout is either a troll or an idiot

Definitely match in then. You’ll smash it at that level.

You looking to complete the set?

u/BruteSlayer I think your means good bro. Take this silver (sorry it’s all I have left for)

Crits don't apply to *any* other super, they just need to barely graze you and its instant death.

Im in a squad of 4 usually and im the one invading like that half the time cuz my team slays ads to fast and always have portal ready plus im supposed to do it cuz i have full invader armor

I'm still waiting for my terrible weeks to pay off...

Why is Xur selling a quest exotic? lol
---
This vendor is a joke.
---
Dat Lean.
---
Youre the one that threw the match. In my eyes youre the scummy one lol.

---
It’s almost like different people have different opinions.
---
Id be happy if im getting free wins like that..
---
:l
---
Luna's Howl is the go to HC in pvp, just because of how OP it is. It's become a hated weapon due to how easily it can kill players. 
---
The first jump you aim for the right and dodge left. 
---
The second jump is probably the hardest. You put your sparrow on the little lip thing and come to a full stop. Get off your sparrow. Walk behind it a little more than a sparrow length. As you summon your new sparrow, use the old one as a launching pad.
---
The third one you can't do that summoning trick. But you can make the jump with just a sparrow and dodging.
---
Here is the beauty of the Crucible, the more you play it, the better you become. you start realizing when not to peak. You start trailing other decent players and learn to team shoot. Even comp becomes rewarding. 1/3 of the time you are paired with a god tier player. 1/3 of the time they are on the other team. What do you do during that other 1/3? Do you make the big plays that wins your team the match, or do you do stupid stuff and learn from it? I really don't feel like anything is over powered. There are ways to combat everything, you just need to learn from them.
---
Found it. 
---
Keeps you from trying to use crappy rolls, too...
---
Thanks for the explanation, I was also confused at this 
---
That's depressing...
---
"Dude just /join"
---
Found the two bows raider
---
I think if sparrow racing comes back, Amanda would be the announcer 
---
Maybe it's you?
---
All characters are lvl 50
---
That's due to an exotic and the person continually getting kills and activating it, I do notice it does take a lot of damage to take a hunter down in spectral blades though, they are quite tough considering how nimble and agile they are.
---
Nah, you're good.  
---
Even without the exotic, it lasts too long for the potential it has
---
Not too many folks are doing the guided games thing. You maybhave an easier time at r/fireteams

I’ve ran Leviathan many times and never once have I ever heard any other Guardians refer to it as the American Ninja Warrior Course 😂

The S stands for sucks

Check your network connection. If your network is running slow you may have trouble with matchmaking.
---
I know it’s brilliant some of them these pair were awesome constantly avenging each other and the best bit is it was completely random as themuffinmans my brother 
---
It left me satisfied and smiling. 
---
Networks fine. All other games working great. All other devices have no problems.
---
His shots actually healed the enemy
---
Just take it as the usual quality control for games that use this type of pay-to-play dialogue. You were just adding to the realism. 
---
Lol this crucible body shot circle jerk has long lost my attention. You boys need to step up your crit game and learn how to Destiny
---
Any void and any hand cannon should work, most people use IKELOS hc because it's both and 180 rpm. Did you do them in quickplay? It goes faster in comp and iron banner.
---
Lmao, the right is everyone stopping when an invader arrives 
---
“Two bows” 😂

Thanks didn’t know that existed

Top boy

Cus people are sweaty as fuck in that game mode. I just don't use team chat most of the time.

I’ve gotten the triumph like a week ago and have gotten over 30 drops but not a single one has dropped 😂 just my bad RNG
