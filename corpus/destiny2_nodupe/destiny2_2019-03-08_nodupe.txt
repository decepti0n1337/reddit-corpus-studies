What do I have to do to get it??

---
---
I was 5 years old in Sunnyvale, 1977, when dad got a hold of a 2600 for christmas.  They didn't even have joysticks yet, just the paddles.  After almost 42 years I earned the right to play any damn game I want.
---
Not super sure, but I think it may be from collector stuff.
---
Basically their business model is utter and total garbage.  I got it a while ago before forsaken and even bought the expansions but never got into it much... so yeah... lots of money out the door and not even really allowed to play at the moment.  Locked at lvl 30...
---

---
Their model makes it so anyone who once played isn’t welcome until they give them more cash, never seen a game like it.  I’m sure there are others... but just wow.
---
No apologies needed, everyone messes up starting out playing new games! All good. Besides, what's the point playing if you cant have fun? ✌
---
There’s an entire youtube community full of destiny 2 fans that make videos of ALL kinds to show how to obtain items and triumphs, why is is not an acceptable solution? People shouldn’t be dependant on having every bit of info be spoonfed to them, if they want to learn how to play a gamemode they can literally watch a guide while loading into the game and they’ll be good to go. 
---
And doing it that way keeps the d2 youtube community flourishing, which reaches out to more potential new players.
---
Well that’s all I need to hear. 
---
MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE, ACTIVATEDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
With that glas shit on and you basically just die all the time.
---
Yes, I knew that. But only above 1 LL from powerful engrams? Thought it might be an issue.
---
Lol same. I am 32. I still can hang with the best of them though 😘
---
I guess I'm the odd one out then. I still have close to 150, but I don't keep things that are below 600 power unless they're good roles.
---
No, you can hit 700 without the AP, but it will be slower for you since the AP holders have more Powerful Gear activities to grind.
---
And ffs don't kill the envoys if we're being invaded. We can't deal shit to the primeval if we're all dead.
---
im going for vanguard on 2/3 of my characters, so this is false. also read the oxygen sr3 lore.
---
My prime dropped at 666 pl last night as well!!
---
Stop defending PvP play and making fun of people for not liking PvP with one breath, then complaining about blueberries with the next.
---
I hate Gambit, and I'm *definitely* playing Prime, and i'm bringing my worst PvP game. I'ma shoot the invincibles, lurk near the portals, and invade when I have zero chance of getting kills.  This might actually be fun, for once.
---
(J/K I dislike Gambit less than Crucible; at least I can hide when I hear an invader.)
---
the game isnt dead, and anthem is btw
---
I have, I've played in crucible the last time I played destiny 2 on the same character. My other friend who beat the game and DLC also wasn't able to play last night either
---
Because those videos should be discussing strategies and ways to win, not explaining the basics of how the thing works. Could you imagine if Microsoft released Word without a help file, and left it to people on YouTube to show people how to use their product? This is a product you paid for, just the same, and a developer who can't be assed to type up some text and put it in the game.
---
That’s... what a new format is.
---
If diligent invader is the bounty where you receive the helmet, those matches are regarding reckoning. For the malfeasance, are you playing normal gambit or gambit prime?
---
guess you havent read the lore for oxygen sr3
---
The Iron Lords went to Site-6 because it housed Siva. They awoke Rasputin asking him to use Siva to better off the city and humanity. Rasputin knows the uncontrollable nature of Siva and refused and tried to fend off the Iron Lords (using to much force than what was needed), he saw the Iron lords as a threat to the Siva being stored there. Not saying what he did was right, but he was defending his bunker.
---
it wont get nerfed, its a hunter exotic
---
ohko on a warlock in well, so yes
---
Never thought about me being over 40 while playing D2 lol
---
Same age and funnily enough, I used 'IsThisPong' for my Apex Legends nick - had a kid ask me if it was a Battle Royale type game.  I said yes, for two people.
---
Thanks for the answers guys, I'll just wait then a week or two and then play :)
---
Oh I didn’t know that. For malfeasance I’ve been doing normal gambit. Thanks for the help
---
I purchased this print through Etsy from your store, exceptionally happy with it and the other prints like Not Forgotten or Sunshot!
---
If you're on PC, the clan I belong to is always looking for people...err, peeps, homeboy!
---
No problem, and I'm not sure why the wins in normal gambit aren't counting /:
---
My friend got the new Walock gauntlets first day
---
Idk I might give up until Tuesday
---
DING
---
i don’t have ur, but if i did i would. 
---
Boom, 33 here. Do not have 16 hours a week to dump into the game. Have a great clan though with lots of weekend warriors.
---
Yep, I'm on PC :) Which clan is it? Is there a discord or something I can check out? Thanks!
---
Reckoner is an amazing song honestly.
---
Its pretty fun 
---
You will be fine I was running at 648 and 649 yesterday with the glass modifier. Today is grenader well of light and void singe you'll be good at 650 
---
Got locked out of my petra bounty which sucks a whole bunch
---
My mistake. Then Reckoning at 650 is doable.
---
Honestly it seems like anything. End of the game. Killing high values. Killing the enemy team in an invasion. 
---
Do NOT get in that Well if an invader just popped over to your side. Kill them first. 
---
My favorite load out is what ever primary, jotunn, and hammerhead.  Jotunn is sooooo nice, see them invaders pop their pretty lil heads and boom, fireball 12d6 to your face.  I like how they made it more important to kill those dudes because they can heal the prime easy and you do so little damage in the beginning.  After the 3rd envoy spawn I switch to reload barricade and just drain the hammerhead on em.
---
Everyone has this, it has been adressed
---
33 and that is my favorite damn gun in the game.
---
Wow, this single quest is making me want to uninstall this game permanently. Who decided this. 
---
Ding!
---
I only have the weekly bounties left in terms of powerful drops. Well. Raid too. I might give that a look in. But it is annoying...I want to Forge!
---
Yesterday was annoying with glass tho 
---
I had a guy ask me to help him with the very last boss. First time playing it, first time finishing any raid in D2, I got it and another pretty good pulse rifle maxed out at 10. I was only with them for like 10 mins. 
---
same, told myself i'd just enjoy vanilla and maybe if i like it get destiny 3 whenever it rolls around. fast forward 1 month and i got the forsaken bundle, fast forward again and i'm considering the annual pass, though this one i'll probably wait on until the the last season drops
---
Ding
---
I do see what you’re saying but I think they should at least put something for people that can’t buy the annual pass because right now there’s literally no new content so the games kind of dried up for people like me that don’t have it
---
The last thing you'd want in your Burger King burger is someone's foot fungus. But as it turns out, that might be what you get. A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce. With the statement: "This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King." Admittedly, he had shoes on.
---
yeah the loot chase is minimal. Ive never been a legacy player so cant comprehend how it plays
---
Same for me. I finished it not even two hours ago but I didn't get any good Service Revolver out of the 1K tokens that I invested in, sadly...
---
Basically do important stuff. Get Army of One medals, kill HVTs, kill the invader, bank 15 motes, etc. It's still just a chance though and no guarantee. I've only gotten one of the curated rolls so far (Bug Out Bag) and it was from killing a HVT Minotaur.
---
I had mine drop from competitive crucible. Btw pair it with top tree arcstrider and a shotty. Remember backing away from yellow bar gladiators? Now you can just punch them to death.
---
ding
---
Gambit Prime should be restricted to 4-man premades.
---
If you all are on Xbox hit me up GT Athura22
---
Yeah. Inquisition. 
---
Damn I love that game. 
---
I need to run through it again. 
---
How DARE you sir, how dare you have fun playing a game 
---
When I played destiny 1 we had this one guy on our clan that we thought he was our same age but one day he mentioned his son and he told is he was 40 something years, and he said that he was going to buy another PS4 to play with his son it was really cool tbh glad older people are still playing games 
---
Kamekameha is better Palpatine weak af dog. If you use bottoms palpatine you also get literal lightning shit. 
---
Also malf quest is glitched
---
Ahhh yes know I remember, this was the first game I ever played on my PS4 long ago. I didn’t stick with it for very long but I will admit it was pretty fun :) 
---
It’s a mythical engram. 
---
EXACTLY!
---
I just turned 30, and feel the same way.
---
Will do, thanks! 🤠
---
I think it's always good to provide sources for things like this, because sometimes it's unclear what is a feature and what is a bug. 
---
[List of known issues, including quests and bounties being bugged](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46168)
---
[Tweet about the new nightfall scoring threshold](https://twitter.com/A_dmg04/status/1103005154733830144) (I honestly thought this one was a bug before seeing that. It seems so strange to have a power handicap of 0-100 do literally nothing but lower your power level for no benefit). 
---
Wish I could pull a gun. So far nothing.
---
Don't play gambit if you don't know how to play gambit. 
---
Are you on pc and is there room in your clan? Getting to the ripe old age of 34 and feel weird about joining a clan with mostly youngsters. 
---
My last team would disagree
---
Eff all this gatekeeping, it's been out for like 4 days. Get a life
---
Same for me I play a ton in the winter and very little other then that 
---
Google itself is a search engine. You cannot post things to it. All google does is takes what you put in, search it's database of websites, and show you the best results. 
---
Exotic 😉
---
I don’t think so because the drifter sets you up with the quest to get the Last Word and I don’t believe there were any serious complications between your guardian and the Drifter for the duration of it.
---
First, don't feel like you need to rush. A lot of people think various random things like quests, whole raids, items, etc. will vanish for no other reason than that they assumed it would, but the only limited time activities are holiday events. 
---
Second, look to see what other players are doing during public events. [Each one has a secret objective that will turn it into a heroic public event](https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/2017/9/7/16263480/heroic-public-events-find-trigger-earth-titan-nessus-io), so if you see other players doing something unusual, that is probably why. Heroic public events used to give much better loot, but now the main reason to do them is to complete certain quests later in the game and to get lots of xp. 
---
Third, do not try to ration glimmer or ability points. You will get enough ability points to unlock every power, and you will probably max out on glimmer because there is almost nothing to spend it on if you do not own Forsaken. 
---
Please explain.
---
50 here. Feeling a little better seeing all these other geezers. I always wonder if the person next to me still in middle school and has a 9:00 bedtime. 
---
I read it as Warlock and was about to have a mental break down. 
---
wait is that real?
---
37 right here. Went hard at destiny 1 and jumped on destiny 2 at first, stopped playing when I needed to insert money. Just recently got the dlcs on discount and jumped back in. Really missed it, grinding like mad once again.
---
F
---
Try 50s
---
Me too but at 10 % so its the whole quest step that's bugged
---
I just wish we even had a choice to get the Arbalest
---
29 y/o here since the start
---
Was about to say, “you said he posted it on Google” but am now realizing you’re a different person. Still would like to know how s/he posted to Google. 
---
Nice. What Printer/settings? Links to the STL?
---
Way too much resources to create a skill detecting tutorial, pulling people out of the game also would be extremely detrimental however the loot thing seems like a nice fix and i would agree but would create some sour posts when someone nabs an exotic you "earned".
---
The problem is like you said, the info is there but most people clear it, or don't make attempts to learn.
---
Cool! I hope that was intended and not some bug
---
My clan has a range of about 18 to 68. Median age is around 35
---
this is cool and all but can we talk about the dot on the cone? i fucking wiped my screen for that
---
[The other subreddit has a super long Returning Players Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9b97fn/destiny_2_sandbox_update_faqs_returning_player/).
---
If you have any specific questions, I would be happy to answer them, but so much has changed that I am not really sure where to start. 
---
The problem is many do not act like an adult, that what skew the perception.
---
I was just trying to do this, killed titan hvt and nothing. Same for the IO one. Still at 0/2 (I can confirm that I got the killing blow)
---
MICHAEL!!
---
Shaxx is infinitely old but stopped having birthdays after 69
---
I agree.
---
I think they should do something like holding the button increases/decreases by ten, and single-clicking increases/decreases as normal. 
---
Yes those reasons are true but the real reason why those are used so much in gambit is the heavy ammo economy, one will get around 46 bullets from a heavy drop well that is at least 30 enemies with that amount of ammo and I think it takes just under ten shots for an invader too so it just makes the most sense to run machine guns 
---
you're not wrong
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 13 - - No LFG posts and no clan recruitments.

---
Oh cool
---
|I like to smash children
---
wait wait
---
|with jotunn 
---
Thank God 
---
No. There’s only been me and two others in there
---
IDK, but you can probably only get it from eververse.
---
stop reposting scrub
---
I need to get back on D2...been a long time thanks to apex
---
Modeled up by me for a customer. There's a 3V LED in there and some blue acrylic for the window. The little gems will be added by the customer.
---
I also got the curated Bug Out Bag from killing an HVT. 
---
Yeah, it's disgusting. He finally cleared it just yesterday.
---
It depends on the guard perk. Burst guard is higher def low efficiency. Anything new with random perk roll can have it possibly. Crucible sword, abide the whatever, you get the picture.
---
well unfortunately thats what happens when bungie decides to base an entire season of content around a silly game type
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
its bugged like this on my titan but not my other two characters, one of my friends has it bugged on all three
---
And hello fellow xbox warlock
---
c r o p
---
26 here! 
---
Okay
---
Makes sense, like your passion.  You a PC player?
---
It's the only way to cope with D2 PVP tbh.
---
PS4, but I want to get a pc soon
---
After you've done the base game+Forsaken about 8 times (3 for all my characters, 3 for a buddy, and 2 for a different buddy), plus done weekly heroic missions for a few months... I dunno. I'm burnt out. I skip heroic missions most weeks.
---
Bumps head on cabinet, dies.
---
I just want to feel his horn one more time
---
Oh fuck I commented that
---
Yeah somebody made a YouTube video on it a couple of days ago.
---
Early game is abit dry but the end game is a roller coaster 8/10
---
Won’t happen until d3. There’s been a big buildup between the eco stranger and a bunch of other things. D3 will definitely be a much bigger war against the darkness. 
---
Had it happen in Reckoning...a LOT. I will do my best to revive someone unless there's a huge group nearby (and even then I sometimes Leeroy Jenkins it and die a foot away from where they died. Huh...so THAT'S why they died). But the respawn time takes so long and then the person has to drop back in. You lose a lot of DPS that way.
---
Scares me to think that tier 2 is coming out tomorrow.
---
Don't link the lore, but PM me where to dig if you would please.
---
And how's it going?!?! Near to finish? Wish you luck
---
[removed]
---
The leader of my clan is in his 60's!!! Don't let your age dictate your fun!!! 
---
And ?!?! Are you ready?😎
---
Quiet! This kind of talk is why D2 launched without machine guns.
---
What the hell am I looking at? Are you stuck in Rivens but and laterally need someone to bring you banners?  You know it's a check point right?
---
Full stacks is 60% damage boost. I know, I have the same roll except I have tap the trigger and swashbuckler. Mine with full stacks has higher DPS than my Hammerhead.
---
Also a melee kill gives you all 5 stacks. You're welcome.
---
If you look closely, you see that I managed to counter the energy burst of his shild but he immediately followed up with a shild bash and got me anyway.
---
I’m loving my sole survivor 
---
I know there will probably be either another forsaken sized DLC or annual pass. Most likely focussing around Savathun, and keeping in line with the post credit scene (mercury, Mars, reef, titan/dreadnought, The Darkness/D3)
---
Seriously I had a 540 guy just kinda pacing around doing nothing one time. Gave up hope of winning so I kept invading to run out the clock. If I have to suffer so does the enemy 
---
ah don't worry, most of my clan is over 50, but they play more than me
---
Ah nice, I'm not the only one!
---
I figured it would make it easier for people to just be able to see my platform and main class so they don't have to ask and I don't have to always say when it's relevant. 
---
Can we start a dad clan 35 yo reporting in. 
---
I'm going for Dredgen and I've yet to get Malfeasance at all, so the sooner I get it the better. 
---
Yea i main warlock but i have all my characters above 640 rn in case i want to play hunter or titan
---
r/woooosh
---
Yeah I used it a lot on my Titan and devourlock for a long time... Loss of exotic heavy sucked in late game though.
---
Do you have gambit weapons?  I think that's part of it. 
---
Yea I've been ready to chuck my controller since I've seen teammates kill the high value target and get weapons. Solo kill the thing and nothing just synths.
---
Hi Christian here. Just informing you that 666 is a safe and holy number. 616 is the mark of the beast. Enjoy your day!

---
Vex on the field 
---
Im not the only one!!!
---
It really is easy, honestly shocked to see one of the most upvoted comments saying it's hard.  
---
Not just playing smart, but putting some thought and effort into your build helps too.  I run Taken Armaments mod on Sunbracers, giving me an infinite supply of Thunderlord ammo and the 5 grenade spam melts bosses.
---
I think that was the intent. On the one hand the matches are only 1 round, on the other that round has more back and forth with a bigger chance of catching up to your enemies if you fell behind. 
---
Try and get one on a second character. 
---
How long did it take you? Planning on grinding it for tomorrow.
---
I'm not exactly 12yo anymore either. I love this game. Anyway it isn't my fault, Nvidia gave it to me for free with  a 1080Ti so it is their fault. It would be rude not to play
---
Orphanmage, look at the D2 LFG discord, if you haven't already, it is invaluable in grouping up without a clan.

---
&gt; I don’t spray 95 rounds in 2 seconds with Ikelos anymore
---
That's what I have the perfect paradox for
---
So? even if one is trash people enjoy it and harrassing them/laughing at them for it being bad is not ok,we should just let people enjoy what they like
---
🤦🏻‍♀️ like I said. I'm an idiot. 🤣🤣🤣 thanks. 
---
I think its fantastic. Good recoil, good power. Dragonfly and Meganeura are awesome on this. You don't lose the buff so long as you hit your crit shots. You can maintain the 3 stack and clear a room, its so satisfying. I can't wait to toss a Dragonfly Spec mod on.
---
What is... Raid Banner? Must be related to that mode that do not have matchmaking, making it exclusive for only 5-10% of players (according to statistics, of course). Bungie &lt;3
---
? 
---
Oh it finally processed. Ok, so that sight highlights enemies...and it’s highlighting the drifter so
---
I had a few really good ones the day before... And then last night, was terrible. Duo with my buddy, with a couple randos. They had almost no kills, no motes deposited, no guardians killed... Was unsure what they were doing the whole damn game. I was playing sentry. Had more kills and motes deposited than they did. Bleh.
---
The best birth date!! Only turning 24 but I'm with you all the way ❤️

1) The year one gear is useless mostly, year 2 stuff is all usable and still will be, they switched to different system. And you wont be getting year 1 stuff mostly anyway so no worries.
---
2) Reaching engame is now easier than ever thanks to new power bumb bounties, but there is shitload of engame now. Prepare to get overwhelmed.
---
3) Its about reaching goals by grinding :D There are quests, but there are also random drops, you have to farm
---
4) As far as RnG goes the gameplay itself is not random, you actually have to be good, not just lucky. Even the craziest godroll weapon will be useless for you, If you cant play for shit. But perks on weapons and exotic and cosmetic drops are semi-random, so be prepared fir that.
---
Hey chap: long story short...
---
Gambit (normal Gambit) used to give you a meatball boss at the end very very rarely. They have now un-linked the full curse week on Dreaming city with the meatball spawn and made it more likely to spawn. 
---
When I played the other night, I played 4/5 games and had 3 meatballs! That, pre this update, would have been odds like 1:40,000 or something. 
---
So, when you get the meatball spawn and win you  get different rewards for x number of completions. I got the emblem and ship in 1 night... unheard of pre Jokers Wild.
---
Sorry, that was as short as I could make it.
---
Yea, that bothers me aswell. I dont know why it takes Bungie so long to do this. I have no knowlegde of coding and stuff, but it cant be too hard to give the older equipment the perk system of the armors and weapons past forsaken. It doesnt have to be special perks for each set, I would be happy with the standard ones. So I could finally wear the the escalation protocol armor without handycapping myself.
---
Also the 3 Leviathan-Raids are almost useless to do, since most of the stuff you can get there is outdated aswell and not worth using at all.
---
Baes not been here for couple of weeks now.. 
---
REEEEEEEE
---
Yes! I've had that too. Same team? 😂👌
---
Destiny is far from perfect
---
For someone screaming for PvE content and asking to compare stats, you have 1307 hours played and only 1 raid clear....
---
Because it apparently breaks some systems?
---
Now on to 700....
---
Well, you should try Rec Room (VR). The average age there is like 8 yo XD
---
Yeah don't you.... Oh shit I mean no,no I don't.
---
Wait a minute I'm outside the FBI's jurisdiction.
---
But still no
---
Lol its the most exciting thing getting one as a drop but then you realize how precious it is.
---
Since I have the Jötunn I feel like I am at fault when I get killed by it cause the tracking really isnt that great. Some movement and it misses (and non-direct hits do poopoo damage)
---
Also, if you try to melee him (you can’t, obviously because of the transparent wall) you’ll lunge in his direction.
---
If your headed to Bergusia and can't beat that servitor....how are you going to beat the forge then?
---
What?
---
I feel so left out, I'm 89.
---
Exactly.
---
HVT in Gambit prime dropped the curated for me too last night.
---
Turning 30 later in the year. Can I be in the old man club yet?
---
I don't get these young whippersnappers anyway.
---
Im terrible for infusing as always want my favourite gear to be my highest. Thus I rarely have any cores at all!!! 
---
Sorry i dont speak "i love roasted jews" 
---
You have to wager a more before you jump in the butthole. You make a more by using the Synthesizer. Synths in, motes out. Then you just find the right hole on the bank thing, slather it up, and stick it right on in. When you kill the boss, you get armor when you loot the box at the end.
---
A lot of the toxic children within the destiny community were looking forward to Anthem, but got burnt. A famously poor release with very little content.
---
Roughly 170 hours in Fortnite with my last game being July last year. Compared to my 2700 hours in D1&amp;D2. 
---
It's okay gramps you sound old at heart, you fit right in here! ;)
---
It is actually legitimately funny that Anthem is breaking consoles though
---
We are all honorary titans. 
---
You can put them in you vault, so even more stacks. 
---
How? Doesn't he brings you back instantly after 4?
---
The only way it comes to my mind is to kill 3, have them gathered again and throw blade barrage/any high AoE super/weapon that kills them at once. But what are the odds
---
Thanks, psyErectileDysfunctionk. You’re one of the good ones! 
---
Mmm yes, I also like my wine crunchy
---
All of the raids have been fun, certainly a lot more emphasis on the mechanics in D2 compared to D1.
---
You seem fond of D1 raids yet only have 12 clears? 
---
All of the four matches you have to put a little mote in the bank
---
A shitload of new content and absolutelly different game
---
Ein weiterer deutscher Landsmann... ich bekomm nie die forsaken exotics die ich will... hoffentlich bringt xur die heute

Granted, you’ve more time played, but it doesn’t seem like you’ve done much with it...
---
45F here. I’ve played video games my entire life. My mom even sent me a bunch of old stuff from school she had saved from when I was a kid and there’s a school journal with an entry in it from 1982 or 1988 (can’t fucking remember haha) that says “I love playing video games” 
---
D2 is one of the games that I play all the time 
---
The drifter be like
---
#*non-alright noises*
---
Why make jokes at the expense of another game?
---
Destiny's core gameplay was always enjoyable though. A lot of people do not think the same of Anthem.
---
But Anthem really makes it look pretty close
---
Wouldn't that just lead people to make 3 stacks and then we would need a separate queue for them and one for duos. 
---
ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT...
---

I’m happy with practically everything except the whisper and sleeper nerfs, I’m not really sure what the driving force behind those was

I can't unsee the "High Value Tracker" description having a different font color.

I want to go back to sleep, but I witness it whenever I close my eyes. Little lily white alphanumerics, terrorizing me with their non-uniformity. I need to go to the bathroom, but I'm too scared to get out of bed. I just know that as soon as I set one toe on the carpet, an alabaster "I" will grab me me from the depths beneath by boxspring. Or an ivory "K" spring from the closet while I fearfully walk down the hall.

whisper nerf is understandable but it was way too far. reducing the reserves from 20 to 15 or 12 would be fair because the perk of it requires being precise. as for sleeper, lol that was a dumb nerf. no one uses sleeper anyway 
---
Sentry is better than Reaper for sure. Problem with the boosts in the light is they only increase your defensiveness but your all still a massive sitting target for an invader.
---
What? Linear is related to the maximum power of the variable.
---
Who told you that? Because they're wrong...
---
I need help Guardians.
---
Since Season of the Drifter started, I’ve only played my Hunter. 
---
I was a Titan Main. 
---
I AM A TITAN MAIN. 
---
Help me find my way again. 
---
Have they tried the crucible?
---
Hunters just marksman dodge
---
Thanks a lot for this information! I will take it all and use it wisely. 
---
Do you have any good recommendations regarding weapon loadout that will fit me? I will avoid invading at all costs. I will focus more on killing enemy blockers aswell as be a big threat towards the enemy invader if you can take use of this information? Hehe.
---
i need this image without the caption it's great
---
No, it's the tiger stripe shader and the knife trick emote.
---
don't underestimate the first reaper perk
---
Good content
---
I cannot see these lore elements in my inventory am I meant to? I just see them when he gives me an engram

I cant do my 2nd one because ive already upgraded my synthesizer😔

The meatball giving the ground a dirty look triggers a stomp attack, if u don't believe me watch one stomp
---
Green X....? 
---
Still doing it for me..
---
This one feels a bit forced.
---
I main warlock as well. I still drop a rift, melee, then ikelos. Having a titan w you, makes it even better. Melting point, healing rift, double ikelos!
---
I still don't have a way to prove the solo part

---
The super killing one is the only one giving me trouble tbh.
---
That’s my least favorite part about being in a hardcore group. I play all day but if I want to take a week break then everyone gets pissed at me
---
Im glad they realized it
---
Yeah, you're right. Not very good at creating memes.
---
Little confused. I played a few games of Gambit Prime and there was no class selection. Is this just 'understood' between players? Or did I miss something...?
---
40 year old here. My 42 year old wife and I love playing D2.
---
this meme comes at the perfect time, just dropped reload masterwork IKELOS and this is how I was killing that boss for the next dozen of kills :D
---
Flavedo Core works for the Deere theme;  we laughed about this in clan purposely driving around dreaming city killing enemies via boost smashing. 
---
Side note;  this sparrow should move at half speed but do 3x collision damage to any mob it hits.  Also; Sparrows need kill counters.
---
I mainly hate them because of how they like to swarm you. I still have flashbacks to Crotas End, just so many Thrall.
---
True, but if you don't have an warlock and bad luck for the prime evil boss you need that protection a lot. (not recommending doing gambit without warlock) 
---
This art came from the Moon!
---
Ah boogs. I forgot about Whisper nerfs. Yeah that was a little ugly. Though, thankfully Reserves is a thing for perks. 
---
If it has better item level i feed it to my good armor.
---
&gt;How often do your motes run out of time?
---
When you're slaying with a pulse from a vantage point and not actively picking them up run'n'gun style? Kinda a lot.
---
I would recommend something that uses special ammo. Sniper if you're good with them otherwise shotgun or fusion. Telesto Jotun erentil, mindbenders sg,long goodbye sniper for example.
---
Glad I'm not the only one with this problem. Was beginning to think I didn't know what a full set of armor was...
---
Word. Fantastic to know. I'm actually happy to see that, considering it was such a seriously cool shotgun and immediately stayed banked. 
---
Also forgot to mention, keep bank clear. If there's blockers in prime they drain your motes from the bank an will screw you over real quick lol. As for loadouts I would definitely say go for the full set of what you want. An if you run titan go middle tree striker with skullfort. The melee ability is amazing at ad clear an the fort let's you keep using it aslong as you get kills with it. Weapon wise I would go Shotgun, scout, an rocket launcher. Shotgun to deal with up close the scout to pick off Invaders because of how big the map is an the rockets to deal with the eonvoys. If you happen to run warlock the top tree nova bomb with skull of dire ahamkar ( sorry for spelling ) if very nice because you can basically get infinite novas if you get enough kills with it. An after the buff it got it's actually really good. Pairing nova with tractor cannon goes very well to because TC gives a void debuff, so hit the boss a few times with TC an pop nova an it'll be like having a mini tether in your pocket. As for Hunter it's the one class o really don't play but, I would assume the Cestial nighthawk an golden gun could put allot of work in. So for the lack of Hunter knowledge lol. Looking back I just realized how much I typed an it makes me feel like a nerd lol. Well that's the stuff I personally would use with some minor adjustments just because I love invading. But I think you'll be fine once you work with different stuff an find what you like. If you play on PS4 feel free to add me PSN: specialop703
---
Oh shit man that is a fortune!
---
No xd
---
Yeah I have the pass. What I missed is the doing the quests thing XD I always skip those contracts because I barely play Gambit :S
---
Yeah, some days I'll play for 6 hours, then go two weeks without anything. Makes it hard to be part of a group at all. 
---
Lower cd summon sparrow is goat

**Intelligence 100**
---
It is the perks for the new armor sets that you get from Gambit Prime.
---
Good on you if you tried though. In the case of the 22 year old, I think it might have been more than age that was holding him back. Even 22 yo in sports is not old at all. Considering that American football has the youngest age for retirement at 28.
---
Bows work wonders while invading,  and against the invader,  and only invade right after you or\your team put down blockers to the other side
---
listen here m8
---
They’re not All gambit based quests, I think I played one game of gambit?

Dead handy to do!

Anthem BAD

Im just joking

I switched over to destiny from anthem a couple days before that update dropped. Thank fuck for that

See, this is why I don't do Gambit. I'm a fuckin' moron, and I'd screw it up for everyone else. I stay in my little PvE lane, because that's what I'm good at :D
---
If you're not running Code Of The Juggernaut with a Trench Barrel shotty and Synthoceps, you're doing it wrong.
---
im just gonna throw him at the enemies and assume he shoots them

Sounds frustrating too!  Curious to see how it goes, Ive never did that raid before but I wouldn mind getting my hands on that Anarchy weapon :D

My headcanon is  my guardians are all friends who met when the tower was attacked, my warlock and hunter were both risen for the first time recently and are still adjusting. But my titan I'd a grizzled veteran of the Titan order he teaches a Cqb combat course on Wednesday nights.. the night the traveler was attacked Edboi(titan) Edwina-2 (warlock) Eddy(hunter) were all enjoying a bowl of ramen after a hard training session when it happened. After many rounds of ammo holding back the cabal the light went out and something snapped in edboi he knew something was wrong he rallied his friends and punched his way out of the city with no light and that's why my guardians all punch things way way to much. They all look up to the titan that saved their lives with his fist of havoc!
---
yep but hey, i get 450 bright dust
---
Wow, Mithrax is shorter than I realized. XD
---
If it helps I didn't realize there was a bounty for each class, and I was pissed that I had to get tons of invader kills as a reaper/sentry. I realized this as I bought the wrong one on my alt and actually noticed the other ones (by class). It also took me a while to realize I can just abandon the unwanted ones and get the one I want. 
---
Solid week for me. 
---
You can hide your HUD of completely. That would be the only possible way.

I’m not even sure if that would prevent hit point markers from popping up though.

Hell yeah. Congrats. Now get to 700. Worst part for me was finally having the ole fashion and function where i wanted it to now wearing whtever gets me higher

Why do you think I left them it’s way to toxic over there all I see on reddit is actually good constructive criticism when it’s called for not children typing swears at you in all caps calling you gay.

Invader - 
---
* Kill Monger is gonna have timing issues if the invader comes back and the Primeval shield is up
---
* Bank Robber is just going to get you killed standing by the bank
---
* Best perk is Lethal Defense for extending kill streaks 
---
Collector - 
---
* Inheritance and Umbral armor has the most value. 
---
* Cashback means you can run heavy scavenger perks? 
---
* How powerful is the Giant blocker? Could be some value here. 
---
Sentry -
---
* Only valuable perk is Invader Tracker 
---
* All other perks can be done with the right loadout 
---
* What good is max stats in the well? Not gonna stop an invader QBB shot or fire spitting primeval. Doesn't increase damage.
---
Reaper -
---
* High Value Tracker could be good against Ultras, all others die easily (except that damn Vex hydra)
---
* Major Rewards pairs well with Taken Armaments for more Heavy
---
Conclusion -
---
* Best setup is either 4 Collector or 2 Invader/2 Collector
---
* Everything else can be done with loadouts and scavenger perks 
---
Eh? What’s your PL?
---
i was 647 when update dropped
---
This might be a great template.
---
this was the only exotic i ran until i got thunderlords, too broken in pve to waste an exotic slot on anything else. plus trace rifles got a 30% buff to damage. slap the catalyst on it and watch it rain orbs of light
---
Take a blue you goddamn commie
---
Comments like this are so ignorant.
---
You can be any age and enjoy video games.
---
It's like back when Elvis came out and everyone said his music was from the devil.
---
Such rubbish
---
Pro tip: get 4 more team members.
---
sturm and drang? don't see those often enough. slap a green shader on and it'll be master chief
---
As a Reaper I’m still a little disappointed in how underwhelming the pinnacle perk seems compared to the other 3.
---
School is important.
---
Doodle at home. 
---
Yeah the buff is really nice! Is the catalyst a random drop or is it faramable some where? Says something about tough enemies in strikes when I mouse over it.
---
More annoying is when you have 24 or 49 in the bank and the last person holding motes runs by the bank on to the next wave... while holding 4 or less motes. 
---
They’ve somehow conceived that it’s a crime to deposit anything less than 5.  
---
But what if you don’t need 4 more team members 🤔 
---
They are space rhinos. Get it right my dude. 
---
Then get 3 more team members :D
---
Destiny wasn’t complete were you even around? They locked half of the game in eververse and made weapons worthless. This game almost died twice in both launches because Bungie got lazy. Pointing out flaws doesn’t make someone a fanboy
---
you get it from completing strikes, just take your time running strikes for 
---
Savathun, obviously.
---
I really like this one, but sadly it hasn't guiding light. Then it would be perfect. Please Bungo!
---
Console or pc?
---
They made the game more accessible to new players with the most recent expansion (Literally released last Tuesday).
---
Once you reach max level, (Should be no more than 8-10 hours of gameplayer for all expansions combined? Unless you use a free level 30 boost that comes with the season pass, you'll shave off like 7 hours), then you can do Drifter Powerful bounties that'll skyrocket you to 640 power level for roughly 1 hour's worth of work. (Max is 700 now)
---
Reaching maximum power level doesn't require RNG. There's some things like daily quests/weekly quests that reset every tuesday that give you powerful gear drops. It's not RNG related, but if you get unlucky and like 3 powerful engrams are all boots or some crap, then it'll just take you slightly longer to reach max power. All in all, not a big deal.
---
Most of the more sought after and powerful exotic weapons come from quests, again, not RNG related.
---
RNG comes in when you're hunting for the "god rolls" on your gear. Each piece of gear comes with random perks. Some perks are better than others.
---
RNG also comes in when trying to get exotic armor drops. However, you can purchase some from "Xur" (Special NPC that spawns on weekends). With the recent expansion, he now sells Forsaken exotics too. He cycles his inventory every weekend.
---
Additionally, there are absolutely no pay to win features in this game other than the level 30 boost... which is honestly irrelevant.
---
PvP will be extremely hard and unpleasant for you. Especially if you aren't familiar with FPS PvP games. Probably won't be playable for you unless you invest alot of time into it, or maybe you'll get lucky and face a fireteam of noobs.
---
A typical raid, assuming everyone knows what they're doing, is about 45 minutes long. 
---
As far as gear discontinuation per patch. All gear have an "Infuse" option that lets you use your old armor set with new content patches. For example, you got the god roll on a piece of armor and you don't want to swap it out, but it's power is super low compared to the new armors. You can just infuse the new armors into it, to raise it's power level.
---
However, year 1 armors and weapons (Anything pre-forsaken, other than exotics) is un-usable. I don't know if they plan to do something similar in the future, but it's unlikely.
---
28 here, around since D1 day 1

I've been playin d2 since December of 2017 but this has never dropped for me, ever.

##**OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH SHIT**
---
Regular Gambit my highest Guardian kill was 28 in one match. GP my highest is 22 I think. So far at least. 
---
With the recent Season of the Drifter (came out on Tuesday) they have power surge bounties. Those bounties will get you up to 640 power in 1-2 hours of playtime. If you're worried about slow progression you could get the Annual pass and catch up quickly that way. Power surge bounties were made for players who felt left behind at the beginning of new content drops.
---
I initially thought the same... But you have to complete one of the Gambit prime bounties, THEN take to him again, THEN get the quest that allows you to upgrade it... For that character specifically.
---
I try that too, as a Hunter main. Although I did used to play Titan.
---
Just Warlocks? Imma finally get them Oathkeepers AND Trinity Ghoul.
---
Console
---
Nothing wrong with that
---
Yeah it bugged out for me to, i'm at 100% for the notes but 10% for the wins 
---
And yet I continue to do it every time. I think I know it's going to happen I just enjoy the theatrics of it so much I can't help myself.
---
What is he selling?
---
Bojler van  a csomagtartóban. Eladó.
---
Yup
---
Bungie integrated AI into the enemies last patch lol
---
When the enemy invader comes back a second time.
---
Did you miss me?
---
Like coke after lent!!
---
I think there's no substitute for trying them out yourself. Get a bunch of exotic guns from the vault or collections and just go and try them out. There are a variety of exotics that some people love and others hate, such as Cerberus +1 and Crimson. 
---
Personally, I like DARCI and sleeper simulant for the heavy slot, though sleeper recently had an ammo capacity nerf. You might want to try out wardcliff coil, since it was recently buffed. For the energy slot, I use Jotunn in gambit. Huckleberry, if you have the catalyst, would be great in the primary slot. 
---
No problem bud! :)
---
Ahhhh yes, I love when we are 24/49, the other team with that succulent gray beef jerky stick ready to be taken, and the one guy with motes just passes by the bank to die to a Shrieker on the other attack site. Of course, enemy invasion comes seconds after, no fail.
---
I want one. 😫
---
I'm stuck using my rust punk with treasure hunter and omni-telemetry.
---
Fun fact: If you get Biotics up fast enough on any boss aside ones you can't punch...it's possible to stun lock them. Primevils, EP bosses, etc.
---
Those aren’t in the random loot pool so he won’t and shouldn’t 
---
Let’s be real the full auto nerf screwed up all trench barrel shotguns. 
---
Lol. Well, sucks to be a Warlock this week...
---
Where is he this week?
---
Jolton is amazing in gambit, its got range explosive, and tracking. Perfect for getting down any yellow bar and big enemies, clearing the bank, and taking down invaders. Just getting it is a bitch tho
---
Tower
---
Yep. I've got both. I'm just happy that they're finally giving everyone a way to offset RNG a bit. Those things are grindy for a reason, but at least now there's some decent stuff we can get reasonably easily.
---
Y E S
---
Oathkeepers were the last Hunter exotic armor that I need so I'm really happy this week
---
Is Ursa still any good?
---
Tower I think
---
Oh Dinklebot
---
What shader is that warlock wearing?
---
I didnt know there was a sought after forsaken warlock exotic?
---
i just finished my warlock forsaken exotic collection, best of luck tho

Those adds are the best thing to ever happen to Tether+Orpheus

49 year old here, reporting for duty. 5000 hours between Destiny 1+2...maybe its time fora break, lol.

I wish the enhancement cores were only for masterworking. You know, like when they were called \*masterwork\* cores.

It's funny my Misfit is at 666 right now too, I thought it was fitting especially for the name!

My dude, I'm turning 40 in a couple of weeks and I feel like my PvP skills are getting way better (which means I haven't thrown a controller at the wall in about a year now). This comment makes me miss my old raid group where I was the 2nd youngest in the group.

Im not a noob to the game and i play gambit, mainly for quest lines and powerful gear but i guess i am still learning something new everyday about this game which is awesome, truth be told.

Can we get this as a drifter line please like him just talking to a guardian and telling him this PLEASE!!

We need a sunshot sparrow
---
Haven’t tried it yet, it’s the one with increased melee damage right?
---
It hasn't
---
Yea I've done that a bunch of times
---
My psn is my username on here. Add me and I can help with w/e.
---
I'm not particularly salty about it... I wanna see what the perks are. Hopefully they're better than the ones I have. 
---
This community spent most of year 1 spewing hate about the lack of content... I don’t understand why people would want regular gambit to go away. Split the player base? Is anyone having trouble filling out a match?
---
The strategies in prime are completely different, and I love the fact that you don’t need a specific team composition to have a hope of winning. The only things it shares with regular gambit are the mote collection and deposit mechanics.
---
You’re talking about erasing an entire game mode with 4 maps, an exotic quest, and a pinnacle weapon. What purpose does that serve?
---
That makes more sense. Thanks. They couldn't word it a little more simply? Haha You did a much better job. "Multikills build stacks (up to 5) of extra damage. Stacks are consumed when fighting Taken." There.
---
I'm not really upset considering the exotic is great and the roll is also great
---
Helmet stayed on
---
I get myself to the top of quickplay and IB  regularly, but comp is something else 😂😂
---
I would be ok with this, I would just prefer if io, Nessus, and titan all got new weapons. They all look like regular vendor weapons and not something I’d come across exposing each planet.  What if io has weapons forged from the roots of the dead trees, I think they would look sick. Idk just throwing out some ideas, I just think the current planetary weapons don’t really feel unique enough compared to mercury or mars weapons
---
can I buy?

finding gambit 1 matches takes quite a bit longer now (to the point where i gave up at 4/8 and just went to gambit 2). i thought all gambit 1 maps were in gambit 2 as well? all ive played so far is a couple of rounds on the mars map.
---
  
---
I wouldnt think removing gambit 1 as being removing content unless as you say the maps are not being ported over (because then yeah, youre throwing content out, but it also seems stupid not to have all the gambit 1 maps in gambit 2) 
---
Just my first impression that gambit 2 is just an update to gambit and i love the fact that they have taken gambit 1 and improved / reblanced almost all the issues that were plaguing gambit 1.
---
He definitely invades my dreams every night.
---
Absolutely the armors on nesses are boring too I was actually expecting something similar to the Seva style in D1 
---
Ooooo I didn’t even think about that, like a cool golden age armor set and weapons, I like it.
---
Warlocks got the best exotic. Ursa was nerfed, and oathkeepers are for bows, which is good but no one uses. Ophidia is the best exotic in those 3 hands down. 
---
I don’t think the player guardian has ever betrayed him so I was just as confused 
---
Trust is one of my favorites. 👌 Snapshot sights plus the stability makes it great fun!
---
I don’t think there’s a filter for that on this subreddit 
---
 “YEEEET” -the angry anus probably 
---
Then here I am with ophidian aspect :(
---
Bruh i got legend last season on my hunter so shut yo bitch ass up. You just salty your dress wearing ass can’t even shoot hive straight. Now run along lil light before i nf your ass. We were having a laugh before dumb fucks like you have to pipe up.

Hahahaha
---
It has been passed 24 hours and no digital code yet
---
Gotcha, so when I start doing strikes I can expect people to at least be down to group up?
---
I’ve always did better with Crimson and Malfeasance. I don’t think I’ve ever used trust before even though I’ve had it before 
---
That's the best.  On the dreaming city map, I love fighting the primeval from the top center spawn area specifically to force invaders to get dropped in at shittier locations. (Which I of course have great LOS too) XD
---
Oh darn oh heck
---
Well the currated HC drops from banking 15 motes... so I’ve heard. (It dropped for darts on stream when he was doing the helm collector bounty)
---
You just need to do it when it's the curse week.
---
Yeah, and I take more guardian selfies than real ones now haha
---
What did it give?
---
nope
---
I need you
---
Not sure, this was on xbox and it wasn't intentional 
---
I mean, if they gotta give 'em easy forsaken exotics just to help them catch up with our own innate awesomeness, that's just how it be.
---
Just a lore entry. There's another one near the extractor where ypu place motes in. This one was a bit further out to the side. Not hard to find

i’ve already gotten my meaty ball of loveliness 
---
Chaperone catalyst when?
---
i forgot how fucking salty the D2 community is lmao, bunch of cry babies 
---
Im not talking about you. Remember gambit is a TEAM game? Dont be an asshole, help your teammates out
---
Anybody else think this looked like a person wearing a hoodie?
---
&gt;The hell am i supposed to know he’s gonna pull blade barrage?
---
There are a lot of things, really. Run away from teammates, use cover, use heavy, use a super, run away or just don't engage.
---
&gt;What if i’m not facing him?
---
Then they outplayed you. Use the radar to watch for flankers, then kill them from an unexpected angle.
---
&gt;What if i just got my super? 
---
It's mayhem, just don't engage if you don't have your super. GG can kill from anywhere, you shouldn't need to be in blade barrage range.
---
&gt;Why don’t we just give blade barrage the same time to activate as golden gun?
---
It's actually fairly similar. Golden gun also preserves momentum, so you can use it while sliding, which makes you evasive while doing the animation. It's a panic super, it shouldn't have a long start lag.
---
&gt;As a hunter THAT USES BLADE BARRAGE I can fairly and unbiasedly say that blade barrage is still broken.
