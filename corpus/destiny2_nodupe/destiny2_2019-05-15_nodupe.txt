Ok, there‚Äôs probobly some people cheesing on console, just look up como cheese destiny 2 and then whatever console ur on and maybe u can find something. But imo u honestly shouldn‚Äôt go for it if you‚Äôre not very good or don‚Äôt like crucible

&gt; How do you know they are making enough?
---
How do YOU know?
---
&gt;Do you know what the costs of running an independent game studio are?
---
Do you?
---
&gt;Are you comfortable you could say what the development costs if destiny 2 are? 
---
Destiny 2 took around 300 million to produce. closer to 250m if my memory serves me right. 200m more was spent on marketing. 
---
Launch week D2 had 1.3 million unique users, who would have purchased d2 for 60 dollars retail, not including anyone who spent the money to get a collectors edition.. Do the math yourself. That's not including purchases after lauch week, or eververse/dlc sales, btw.
---
Not really. You only need to come up with an hour or two worth of worldbuilding for a standalone movie. A game with only an hour or two of content would be garbage.

Actually not quite true. There is an extremely small chance that eververse brings back emotes from past seasons in original colors to the storefront. It's how I got the popcorn emote.

The Not Forgotten sure is pretty nice (and will be after the nerf, a precision 150 with high range is still nice), but not for losing your sanity :D

Well I doubt they were just doing bounties because those can be knocked out in like 5 mins. They were probably trying to get some blacksmith triumphs done. 500 jotunn kills in volundr, threat level kills in bergusia etc. But yeah, nothing much you can really do. Forges are kinda dead as there really isn't much of a reason to do them after you got rolls/gear you want. If anything, go super tryhard with your gear and solo it more efficiently like you did. I remember there was a vid where you can pretty much 3 hit the volundr boss as a titan with strykers surehand, wormgod caress, and bottom tree striker titan. But each class has there own form of really good boss melting gear.
---
Xbox
---
I don't think these guys were doing bounties. If they only killed adds the entire time, even for the boss round they were probably farming kills for the triumphs.
---
When I go to do that with a friend, we just kill adds for the first two rounds and let the third guy throw all the orbs at their leisure. But when it's time for the boss we kill it and just requeue.

Yeah but do you try your ass off in quick play?

&gt; Last word is faster,

Last word also doesn't have the range that Not Forgotten and such does.
---
I stopped playing, and happily so, but everyone is different. I stopped having fun, and the grind was miserable because I can only play on weekends.
---
Play it and see if you like it. It is worth giving it a shot.

How does one even do such godlike videos....wtf..

Wouldn't mind seeing it again.

Fighting lion can be *nasty* on control tho.
---
I couldn't even get past level seven
---
Every fucking mission is the same, same boring enemies, same boring loot, same shitty voice lines.
---
Sure destiny has an aspect of that too, but slogging through the levelling part is easier because I know the game actually has an endgame...
---
Coldheart and a sidearm baby
---
I‚Äôm gonna also get downvoted but here goes: 
---
People play the meta to get better. There‚Äôs a lot more to a game than just fights (map rotation, spatial awareness, etc). By running the meta, they no longer need to focus on winning their gunfights as much,since they run what‚Äôs the best to run. Thus, they can focus more on all the other parts of the game.
---
Raiding can't have matchmaking, most people can't comprehend the mechanics on the corrupted let alone any of the last wish mechanics.
---
Though I do agree that nightfall should have matchmaking, it's dumb that it doesn't.
---
You should be replying directly to the people, because they won't get notified if you just post a comment on your own post
---
It is not new...there was a post just like it a minute before /s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
Luna is fun to use, and it‚Äôs a great weapon. Tell me why the hell would you not use it? Do you know what pro players use? The meta. Why? Because to be the best you have to use the best.
---
Yeeep. I'd love to grind for recluse but all that happens is me getting my shit wrecked by sliding shot gunners
---
Low effort rant post. Full of curse words and salt.
---
Well I actually would suggest the edition with all the expansions because you can't skip them anyway, and it saves a good bit. Even if you have the base game. 
---
With Forsaken it gives you the option to skip ahead right up to the playable level of forsaken and skips the story, if that's what you want. But it's super easy to just fly through Osiris. Warmind is when things get better and Forsaken is the best one. But if it still holds your interest after that, the Annual Pass has been golden since it came out so I'd suggest getting that.
---
I, too, get killed A LOT by Polaris
---
Flying would be cooler in anthem if it was integrated into the gameplay. There's no chase sequences, no crazy flying puzzles, nothing. Hell half the enemies can't even deal with flying, like that shield + flamethrower guy litterally can't do anything to you if you're in the air.
---
Are reckoning drops random as long as you beat it? Or do you have to do other things to get a chance?
---
Fair EA announced to investors they are not giving up. Which means they cant cut support for a good while yet and have to at least attempt to fix the mess before they give up.
---
The reputation damage to investors if they did just give up would be to damaging. Blaming everything but the game didnt exactly go down well. 
---
Dont have a source for that last one before anyone asks so take with a pintch of salt just based of lunch break convertations at work
---
Full of the truth. 
---
Try and hide it. The gameplay speaks for itself.
---
I don't use it because I didn't need it to get it so clearly I'm good enough without it... 
---
It's a crutch and you know it. Pro players as you say can decimate with anything; I'm nowhere near that good but they really don't need a Lunas to be good at PVP.
---
You had a "low effort" application of rule 1.
---
they might jsut be +1 in bad spots....something has to be less than 692 and you just have to keep grinding milestones until you get a drop in that spot.  It is slopw the last 10 unless you get lucky...but most things wont matter 692 vs 700.  Good luck!
---
Nobody needs it to get it. I got it without it too and I guarantee I‚Äôm a better player than you, but I still used the gun, because I like to do my best.
---
Wish ender is the best!
---
What does that even mean you literally made a post full of spite and hate because the game messed up a little bit with very little effort and I removed it because it's not a well written post and its not in depth criticism. 
---
It's literally just a bout of anger for a tiny error.
---
Agreed, I also have no problem spending silver on cosmetics. Definitely picking this one up.
---
More like the hyped up dog everyone on the street seems to tell you to bet on until you realise you fell for con artists when you spent all your money on a half-starved dog that's almost falling over from old age.
---
Ok
---
I mean you're still allowed to play Quickplay if you play comp. And what's the point of grinding for a god roll if you aren't going to use it?
---
Knowing most people are running HC/shotty makes using off-meta stuff even easier for the most part. You can play range with pulses or scouts and stretch beyond HC effective range really well, someone who is good with a pulse and manages ranges is a Luna's user's worst nightmare. 
---
Beyond that, what gear do you put on to run a high level Nightfall or something like Zero Hour? You're running the most effective stuff, not going into Zero Hour without an option on your team for all the elemental shields and engagement ranges you have to play, right? You wouldn't handicap yourself there, so why do it in PvP?
---
I get wanting variety, but the truth is there are already a variety of options. The HC/shotty or fusion loadout just works well and fits how most people like to play, which is up close and fast paced vs sitting at the back of a lane waiting for someone to step into it with a pulse.
---
Yea, some people don't like it, some people do like it. Can't please everyone, so they try to please the majority. That's how entertainment works. It has been worth it to me, I feel sorry for everyone who has felt it was not worth it, but what can you do.

So fucking over the Trevor memes they‚Äôre not even funny anymore
---
The most common ones I see are Dredgen, Wayfarer, and (to a lesser extent) Cursebreaker. Starting this week, a significant number of people are becoming Chroniclers. 
---
I'd say any one besides those is a rarer title to consider going for.
---
I only see 6 real engrams, everyone knows exotics are a myth
---
Lol I‚Äôm at 310/500 for the wizened rebuke kills. Can‚Äôt even look at someone with a sniper before I get two bursted by an outbreak prime
---
There was a cheese involved turning in your offering right before the weekly reset then opening it after the weekly reset.  It let you get two pieces per cycle.
---
I only skipped one cycle.  The first Chronicler was like two or three months ago because the guy had been doing the cheese from the first cycle and didn't tell anyone else about it.

**HIVE LORE AHEAD**
---
Did you know that the "dark powers" Oryx stole to create taken were actually stolen from the worm god Oryx killed? We literally could have created our own Taken army if we stole Xol's power. Also isn't it weird that Oryx gets a whole raid while Xol (One of Oryx's gods) only gets a shitty strike? Did you know that the worm gods were the start of the hive, and at the beginning there were 3 sisters: Sathona, Xi Ro and Auresh. These 3 sisters were transformed by the worm gods. Sathona became Savathun, the cunning one. Xi Ro became Xivu Arath, the strong one. Auresh became a male and became Auryx, the explorer. There was a worm inside each one which gave them power. When their power grew, the worm grew hungrier. Auryx killed his worm god, Akka, and became Oryx The Taken King.
---
here‚Äôs the order L to R, T to B:
---
S5, Dawning, Revelry, FotL, S6, S6, Exotic (i‚Äôve got another Revelry Engrams in the postmaster :))
---
Iron Mayhem,shaxx and saladin are there and they constantly argue who says what
---
Bruh you don‚Äôt need 1k for dredgen lol
---
Only engram i'm holding onto is "Ive's last engram" on one of my alts, which I picked up during arc week. 
---
It baits me into going to the cryptarch every time in in the tower...
---
I meant 1k points, not the weapon
---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined ;-;
---
Oh yeah. I thought the dawning one was solstice haha
---
Murderer!!! Oh how I miss this game lol
---
And before you panic about the changes, actually use it after the change.  With how they are talking about it, it sounds like it will actually make the gun a bit easier to use in PvP.  Maybe not quite as fast no, but if you‚Äôre using it right you‚Äôre not shooting full speed all the time anyway.
---
Where is the forsaken bright engram did u accidentally use it
---
I didn‚Äôt think The Hunter, Avenged would change season to season, so that‚Äôs what i‚Äôve got to show for S4 EV
---
You mean autism repellant
---
True
---
maybe try get a blue engram to drop and then don't pick it up so it goes to postmaster?
---
Cursebreaker is pretty RNG heavy and takes time to get the eggs and bones. Dredgen does take some skill and time to get with the 3 infamy resets. If u going for rare I think Rivensbane or Blacksmith are they way to go but if u arent in to raiding then def go for Cursebreaker. Hope that helps.
---
Same case here. Isn't that lovely?

It shouldn't matter whether they are custom made or mass produced. Ship them together as soon as all 4 are ready. What's the problem with being a bit more flexible?

That's why I'm asking for reasonable solutions.

Same with the gathering codes. Why not exactly? It's not like I try to use 5x a 20% discout coupon on one item. These seals are made to by purchased via individual unlock codes

It's what I like in an exotic, it's really fucking weird yet great and bad, It hotly contests sweet business for my preferred primary because I love weird guns.

maybe start up a new character and when you get the auto rifle transfer it to your vault. I don't know haven't tried

Jumpforce really isn't a good game. Most certainly not for 60 bucks at least. It sold purely on hype, and that works only because people still trust developers after being lied to and disappointed multiple times.
---
The last rank is the toughest bc you don‚Äôt gain infamy for a loss. I suggest buying as many gambit bountys as you can on all your characters. Complete them but don‚Äôt claim or cash them in until your on your final rank (12000-15000) infamy. So drifters civic bountys too when you need a break from gambit bc they still grant infamy after completion. I would say if you grind hard..... maybe 5-6 hours? That‚Äôs just an extremely rough estimate a

---
When withdrawing from collection, exotics are below light. Significantly I might add. And I‚Äôm pretty sure the Exotics you get through story rewards are light level locked. I know my Doomfang Pauldrons didn‚Äôt break 150 when I got them despite me being almost 200 at the time.

yea but exotics dont let you save the engram anymore unless that his postmaster. my thought was that it was a really old exotic drop from year 1 and since their predetermined it vary well could be if thats the case.

but honestly i ment it as a joke lol

Is that.. the mythical... exotic engram????
