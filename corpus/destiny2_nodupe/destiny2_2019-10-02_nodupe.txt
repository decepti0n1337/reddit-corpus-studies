They are at capacity not down. Learn to read the game
---
---
---
That‚Äôs how mine was and I got kicked back into orbit for some reason.
---
I agree with this person, props to you keep up the good service of announcement.
---
Spoiler the gun sucks
---
This - played D2 release but haven‚Äôt touched it since.
---
Thanks for your opinion, my over thousand hours over the last two years of D2 are well worth what I've paid.
---
PvP has normalized damage, so two weapons of the same archetype do the same damage. Only difference it perks and most perks can roll on any gun
---
It doesn‚Äôt even send me back it just reloads me back to eris.cant load into the tower either
---
Ok so this guy just isnt allowed to make a post about the servers?
---
I don't think it's unfair and I didn't hit 750 until like 2 weeks ago. I think Bungie realized that their leveling system was complete garbage so they're allowing players to skip that " x powerful reward attempts per week " nonsense and go straight into grinding the relevant content. Or even being able to immediately jump into forges or do dreaming city stuff with their friends instead having to do weeks worth of grinding before hand.
---
How did Bungie not anticipate this? Why couldn't they just get more servers to prepare for this?
---
Good question. I‚Äôm currently on attempt #2. Not sure if I can get in. Is there a zero percent chance or what.
---
dam... i mean you can still play the game, soooooooo i still envy you
---
The digital Deluxe includes seasons 8, 9, 10, and 11. It's a years worth of content.
---
Overall it's cost me ¬£180 for the game and all DLC. Also this isn't acceptable after releasing a ¬£50 expansion. So if I've paid for something and I'm not getting it, I'll bitch however much I like.
---
I meant just for Destiny. You know, just log out for this game, not that much change or dificulty.
---
Actually, I think some people are in based on streams I saw, servers are not perfect, but I think at least some of them are up
---
hey
---

---
did u photoshop this??? I have reason to believe this image may have been manipulated
---
They don't have that either...
---
Yea I made it and someone put it on Twitter and bungie made it the megathread banner for Destiny The Game
---
Is like hitting your head against a brick wall to stop the voices in your from talking to you. Its works once.
---
Oh, this is REALLY rich.  
---
Not only was I #11239 in the queue, but apparently you need to keep showing signs of activity of else you'll get booted for inactivity... which, when I logged on again, I found out I was now at frigging #15000+!
---
C'mon Bungie, you knew this day was gonna be huge, why weren't you ready for the F2P Steam hordes?!
---
There's nothing
---
They do, they also have a twitter called Bungie Help that is related to it
---
If you are talking about when you kill the nightmares, the buff gives extra damage to nightmares
---
I thought pay to win applies to lootbox functions, not actual dlc, which most of the fanbase has anyway.
---
So, there‚Äôs the 3 that open. The top will open first, and then when and only when it‚Äôs destroyed will the next one down open, and so on. Does that help?
---
I agree with this person
---
Not sure how I proved your point as you just tried to justify your comment that failed to answer a basic question (surprising considering your an adult). But anyways, Try to reflect on your answers before posting to avoid making a fool out of yourself. Peace out Guardian.
---
Omnigulls back? Fuck yeah
---
one of my revolvers has increased damage for first  shot, is that then an ability i can look to buy or make for other weapons? essentially making my self a similar weapon as the legendary weapon ? thats the idea?
---
I got kicked out of queue at 4400, network error my ass. I love this game but this is frustrating as hell.
---
Me too
---
Mine was like 5 mins.
---
I don't begrudge new lighters playing for free, but I sure as hell would like to play the content I paid for
---
It was a fun 25 minutes' worth of gametime before I was locked out entirely. Definitely worth the $100+ my wife and I spent on the DLC. I'm just glad all of Bungie's favorite streamers get to play all day still while the rest of us paying customers get to sit around and watch. Great times.
---
Honestly tho üòÇ
---
They should have planned for this
---
Because you have access to them silly one. New light lets you patrol all locations now
---
Pretty sure anyone can free explore the areas now. Just can‚Äôt do the activities
---
It wouldn't be too bad I suppose, if they showed you where you were in the queue
---
Same for everyone else
---
mine hasnt moved ever since the 3 hours ive been queued. ive been in a couple different ones and theyve never changed.
---
"smells faintly of ... carrots"
---
Agreed. Was really excited to play tonight after I got home from work, but found out that I had to unpack the preloaded content, which took about an hour. Kinda annoyed, but decided to check out the subreddit in the meantime to see what people were saying about it. 
---
Nope, servers are down and there's a line of tens of thousands of people waiting to get in...
---
Is anyone actually getting online?
---
All locations are unlocked as of today.
---
You buy the deluxe to get all.  Basic dlc you just get the first season
---
Entitled child
---
This gif Physically pains me, I Miss my robot husbando
---
Also 750 is base power now so everything will be at least 750
---
Hahaha yes! I was 98. Saw steps to reboot on twitter and I'm now at 2050. It hasn't moved for 2 hours lol
---
It's the login/authentication servers. Only player movement/actions is handled via P2P.
---
Yeah, fair. It‚Äôs never been this bad before and anyone implying it‚Äôs normal is delusional. It‚Äôs actually scary they have a ‚Äúat capacity‚Äù notice already created, like, they anticipated this?
---
They have opened some activities from Forsaken for players such as new light players. They can access stories, strikes and such but they cannot access the higher end activities like the last wish raid
---
are you dumb
---
*sobs quietly in the corner*
---
I believe they said it will be in the Heroic Mission rotation
---
The weapons will likely be available to everyone from certain activities after the season. Probably Vex Offensive if I had to guess, so not completely P2W, at least compared to something like CoD.
---
They made the forsaken areas unlocked so people could do stuff in those destinations, think like how you couldn‚Äôt give Petra cookies during Christmas if you didn‚Äôt have forsaken
---
Imo yeah but it depends what kind of games you like, the gunplay is some of the best around and feels great and against the ai the game makes you feel powerful
---
The pvp is fun and can be competitive but the heavy weapons and super abilities you can use stop it from being completely skill based
---
The story ingame is just alright but if you're into looking into the lore it's pretty interesting stuff
---
The raids are 6-man and are all pretty great, only drawback is theres no ingame matchmaking for it you have to either know people already or look on discord or an lfg site
---
The endgame is good but only if you like a loot grind and repeating the same activities to power yourself up
---
I was at 29,557
---
uhhhhh no. Impossible.
---
holy shit can this meme be any more unoriginal?
---
This needs to go on their Twitter feed  - they could probably use a laugh now!
---
please provide update if it worked
---
D1, D2, and all the expansions? Very possible.
---
73...b0aty reference? ü§î
---
Is that the ones that flow red? I haven‚Äôt been paying attention to names.
---
I do not mind a queue. But if you go to the trouble of building a queue fucking stand by it. This is like flying on standby.
---
Same
---
It's also a handcannon that uses *special ammo*.
---
Sorry, your submission has been automatically removed.

That fixed it.
---
Lol no worries, you can‚Äôt get in anyways
---
The login and inventory servers.
---
Moon‚Äôs haunted.
---
Funny how those numbers work huh
---
Give Bungie a chance.  You know those guys are more disappointed, especially when they worked hard on it.  More than money, it‚Äôs their sense of accomplishment on the line.  Pretty sure this is nerve wrecking for them.  Once again, just hang on tight.
---
Or get in only to get weaseled.
---
You can grab it in collections btw
---
Kick ass! Thanks guardian[, it looks slick af!](https://i.imgur.com/dvjE20Z.jpg)
---
It could also mean that the servers will be down for like 3 days
---
Just play when normal people on pst and cst go to bed lol. That's what I do
---
You are what's wrong with this inudustry. Sucking firmly on the cocks of those who do not care about the consumer.
---
That explains why there are so many
---
Is Forsaken still worth buying, especially if I got Shadowkeep?
---
This is gold
---
This meme makes no sense. The servers get full. It happens
---
Considering I made the meme myself... You can exit stsge right now.
---
They should have had an Estimate of Guaranteed players by the Amount of PreOrders. Mistakes were made
---
So wait. Can I move my Xbox acct to pc now?
---
I do get that part, I mean it will be cool to play with some of my friends who will be playing Destiny for the first time. It's definitely easier to get into, and I agree the leveling system isn't all that good. BUT for those of us who put long hours...it sucks.
---
I'll leave this comment here I would like to know if I have to rebuy forsaken as well or not
---
What size monitor is that?
---
I got in. Restart app and go through queue again.
---
You don‚Äôt have the last 2 dlc‚Äôs and the weapons armor that are from those are not obtainable for you unless you buy the dlcs
---
I guess that just means you lack creativity? This is a shit tier meme.
---
That‚Äôs so great
---
Cross save doesn't include content purchased, only your actual progress. If you bought your DLC on Xbox, you'll only be able to play that DLC on Xbox.
---
Gotta get GOG now to round the list out.
---
Well if you bought it you have it, you just would die instantly
---
Awesome, thanks for the info
---
I have a regular 1080p monitor :/
---
Which entrance to the hellmouth?
---
A lot of quests have been added back in to the game - even for players who are returning. I'm seeing adventures and campaign missions that I can re-visit that weren't there a few days ago (EDZ). Not sure about missing items, man. Sorry.
---
No problem hope u enjoy I am enjoying it playing on steam, good luck getting and staying in the tower though.
---
this kills the Guardian
---
Are you serious?  I saw no warning for that.  Do you have a link?
---
Again, wasn't Gofannon supposed to be on Nessus?
---
Gotten here many times and still errors out
---
I think it‚Äôs the thing that gets posted on this sub 8000 times.
---
What?! I haven‚Äôt had any number?!
---
Delete if it doesn't contribute anything. Hopefully it gets a chuckle as we wait to enter the moon.
---
Unfortunately yes.
---
Sounds like you file shared
---
Your number will change dramatically when you move up. This last go round, I went from 16K, 14K, 5K, 2K, then I was in.
---
Not sure what platform you‚Äôre on, but it really is just patience. I logged off once to take a shower after waiting for an hour. Logged back in, and was in under 10 minutes.
---
You'll get everything EXCEPT Forsaken in D2: New Light (free version). Buying Shadowkeep gets you all the new stuff (except Forsaken). Forsaken is worth it for some of the gear and the story, but only if you aren't fussed about the cost.
---
Spoilers... wtf OP.
---
Its a substitute til we get dlc
---
Yes, today
---
Probly not, that‚Äôs GameStop for you...
---
Damn dude there is something wrong with my shit.
---
No, Shadowkeep isn‚Äôt free on any platform.
---
I'm having the same issue. Bought the collectors edition, put in my code, "Invalid"
---
I literally payed for it and I can prove it
---
We had to wait in line to get on. lol
---
Ok thank you for the explanation. I was worried it was somehow downloading someone else‚Äôs crossplay character.
---
I can confirm. Any progress of campaigns that went unfinished were reset once SK went live
---
Got in on my Xbox
---
I got in with no problem.
---
I have never played destiny before but have a friend who always has bugged me to play and now I feel the need to play with him. Do I need to buy everything to play or will the new expansion give me previous versions? Or something else entirely? Thanks in advance
---
You have been put in to jail for 10000 year's :)
---
Same here
---
I‚Äôm not even getting numbers
---
Sounds better than the one I got for Ace of Spades, all it does is increase firefly damage
---
Nothing
---
Yes sir.
---
Also I bought Shadowkeep for PS4 and went on my Xbox account and it‚Äôs letting me play the campaign on that... the expansion is cross purchase?
---
Cargo bay 3 on titan has a couple in it I ran it 3 times and got the bounty complete
---
When I hear her scream I will scream just as loud
---
Hey there. You'll probably need to go to the Tower / Traveler and pick up some new quests by visiting vendors - Curse of Osiris is started by trying to go to Mercury - the game plays a cinematic and then drops you off at Ikora to start the campaign. Warmind - you can select Mars and you get dropped off there after a short story sequence.
---
Yes. When will people just Google things?
---
Yes
---
thought all old characters get boosted to 750?
---
Ugggghhhh lol
---
yes its been confirmed multiple times that that would happen
---
New update puts all guardians to 750 light and made a mess to the campaigns because there isn't a line to follow, also the change from the farm to the tower is a change that it's made in destiny's main quest line
---
Why? What's the point? Why not compare Destiny 2 to Mario then?
---
It should immediately pop up then. It did for me. It is a darker shade though. It won‚Äôt let you collect anything on the bottom line at all?
---
Turns out to access any legacy content, you need to pick it from Amanda in the tower!
---
Same, but it was a Tangled Web Helm.
---
Sell your virgin body to the highest bidder on eBay.
---
It was a server error on their end. My interpretation of the FAQ section made it seem like I couldn't transfer. I'm all set. So if any fellow guardians are having the same issues try again tomorrow or later this week.
---
Looking 4 this 2
---
No. Purchasing SK allows for an update to happen. Once that update goes through you‚Äôre good to go
---
If you dont mind spoiler tagging or PMing me how you advance it? Its really frustrating me lol
---
Gotta disagree with you on that, but you probably expected as much considering where you are posting. 
---
The gunplay feels top-notch. No other game has really come close to how satisfying most of the guns feel in game for me. 
---
The world they‚Äôve built around the game is an interesting blend of science and fantasy and it‚Äôs rich with lore. It borrows a lot of concepts for various other sources but they manage to put enough of their own spin on things that it doesn‚Äôt feel particularly similar to any one movie/book/video game/etc.
---
Character customization and build diversity was pretty shallow, though the armor revamp that was released today should address that to one degree or another. Classes, although pretty simple, are all fun and satisfying in their own way, and exotics can change or enhance their skills in cool ways. 
---
Right now the only real competitors I can think of that Destiny has as a loot-shooter MMO is Anthem and The Division 2, and as far as I can tell neither of those games are doing particularly well. And no I don‚Äôt count Borderlands, they‚Äôre both loot shooters but they take very different approaches to the genre and thus I don‚Äôt think they should really be compared. Destiny 2 is arguably the king of the genre right now and it stands above the rest for a reason, being generic isn‚Äôt one of them.
---
Shadowkeep is all the new stuff released today. D2 New Light is everything except Forsaken and Shadowkeep. Give New Light a go and if you enjoy it / have the money, get Shadowkeep. Forsaken is worth it IF you enjoy Destiny. It is not essential.
---
So does that update involve me waiting for the 120 gig worth of destiny 2 to download? Cause that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs looking like right now. For some reason it‚Äôs making me redownload the game and I don‚Äôt know how to get past it
---
It should be working now, I'm able to get in
---
FIX - UNFRIEND RANDOMS TILL UNDER 300 FRIENDS :)
---
When you meet Eris .
---
Downloading Shadowkeep now - I‚Äôve been craving for a game. Miss Destiny
---
i just hopped on to see the que times and it just let me on!
---
At least y‚Äôall have the dlc
---
Same issue, would love to know if anyone finds a fix for this.
---
Moon lady after the first mission gives them out.
---
Compelling and I don‚Äôt need legs to play destiny
---
Idk I haven‚Äôt played yet
---
You should have received 750 light equipment for free or a as quest reward, also make sure to equip them all because the light of your character is an average of the light of your equipment
---
how much does a death take away
---
Probably the server issues going on.
---
And guardians like you are making it happen, no pressure !
---
It's OK, for the 50 quid they took I got to watch a swirly hexagon and a random number generator going up and down for a few hours.
---
As compensation maybe I'll get a skin for edge transit.
---
On the plus side I eventually got in and revelled in the moon nostalgia until I realised I've paid 50 quid for part of destiny 1 with a lick of paint.
---
Cool, thanks for confirming. I knew about Red War from Amanda, but not everything else. Cheers.
---
So I basically have to go find the red war campaign. I hope at least my progress in that campaign stayed
---
Patch Notes are your friend.
---
Worked for me too lmao how do you even think to do that
---
Yeah it won't and apparently this is happening to other people
---
Alright, thank you.
---
They should have released Shadowkeep and first light separate.
---
It appears you are asking a question about LFG/Clans, or help in-game. 
---
Please post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bzjpkr/official_lfg_megathread_v_4/) instead, look at the LFG dropdown menu on the top bar of the subreddit for various LFG resources, or check the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bvr9ex/official_faq_please_read_before_posting/?) for possibly helpful advice on how to find people to play with our advertise/find clans.
---
 Sorry guys but stop overhyped Byfs.. 
---
 We have so much better Lore kings that's not fair
---
Where did you get the one for Ace?
---
Was already shown in promotional material.
---
Just logged in and it worked with no que
---
Ada-1
---
I was searching through the menus and I‚Äôm pretty sure I just found some rewards at the tower that I think are what you are talking about, apologies if this post had an obvious answer and thanks for replying
---
If it‚Äôs the one you‚Äôre required to do for the story, there‚Äôs no matchmaking for it
---
On PS menu go to destiny and check add ons
---
No I was in a fire team of three. It‚Äôs more than likely because the servers have only recently come back on.
---
It‚Äôs match made
---
If you talk to Amanda Holliday in the hanger in the Tower, she offers the red war, Osiris and Warmind campaigns. If you didn't finish those, that would maybe help with the lore/storyline feeling, I think
---
Foresaken is there and the preorder for shadowkeep
---
Today is when new light was launched making d2 free and everyone was boosted to 750 light
---
Nah you basically grind for an optimized build like enhanced perks for (insert you preferred weapon).  If a looter shooter ain't for you then I don't recommend this game lmao.
---
There in the map hud now. Just look around the earth map and you‚Äôll see the forge logo
---
You need to buy on both platforms
---
When I scroll down all it shows me are my shaders no ornaments, can universal armor ornaments not be equipped to any piece of armor?
---
Same thing for me before I was kicked and placed in the queue
---
I heard other people are having problems with using multiple accounts on console, so like using 2 Xbox Live accounts or PSN accounts, but this is on PC so there shouldn't be a problem with accounts so why don't we have the season pass? I've tried contacting Bungie too but the only way to contact them is through Twitter or their help forum where I posted a thread. No reply yet though :(
---
Very nice, thanks for sharing!
---
Mine said that but I noticed I didn't have a piece of gear equipped. Try checking that
---
Why do you say that?  The question marks?   Pretty sure thats intentional
---
Did you get missions from tower ? I can't think of anything else. Ah, sorry you're having trouble
---
Does it though? I don't see where that is stated.
---
Make a post here and see if you can get some help from bungie: https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help&amp;tSort=3&amp;tType=0&amp;d=0&amp;lang=en
---
Sometime you miss the window to experience something. Happens with a lot of things in life, not just games.
---
Was this an attempt at humor?
---
I logged in at 11.5k in line at around 6pm central. Dropped to like 1k something after 5 minutes got booted. I logged in again and within like 3 minutes of "contacting destiny servers popping up on the bottom successfully started playing.
---
Yes it's a quest step.
---
idk, friend suggested I make it lmao
---
I‚Äôm curious why the Niobe marker is off the map, what‚Äôs up with that.
---
Riskrunner and catalyst for it is the reward
---
750 is balanced as zero. You don't start at max level, you start at minimum. They just said zero is 750 not 0 to make people feel better about losing all their power.
---
Nbn
---
No
---
Bloody
---
Network 
---
We get cut off in a couple months and the landlord id digging their heels in about switching us over
---
I was in a dead clan anyways so i left cause i had nothing to lose and it works, do it, if anything you can join back after everythings fixed
---
It‚Äôs the jade rabbit
---
Ok thanks

I am on Xbox using 2 accounts. Realized I bought Shadowkeep with other account without progress and it is active on there. I am so screwed. I can‚Äôt access season pass on my account with progress. If anyone could solve this I would be forever in gratitude towards them.
---
I'm getting PCMigrationInvalidBlizzard because I guess my battle.net account isn't linked?
---
Do not infuse, sit on that for a long time. Infusing now will make you homeless. Keep what you want, dismantle what you don‚Äôt want.
---
Is there only one?
---
I know that but I mean what's it doing here
---
Forsaken is separate.
---
[It's a Rabbid Rabbit.](https://raymanpc.com/wiki/script-en/images/thumb/8/87/Adventure_Rabbid.png/300px-Adventure_Rabbid.png)
---
Bruh, this is a game, no a philosophical dilemma. They could have easily added an option to start at Level 1
---
Doesn‚Äôt make any sense
---
I think that's the best way to enjoy it. I played a fair amount of pvp and the meta + random loot drops made it feel really unfair.
---
I suppose it was better than everyone using the Graviton Lance.
---
I was just frustrated with playing 197 games of gambit and never getting a Trust to drop. Made competing against Luna (to get the Luna) real hard.
---
I felt so nostalgic when i heard iike I actually smiled
---
I am new. Digging the warlock class. Which spec would be preferable for pvp?
---
To play Shadowkeep, yes.
---
You‚Äôre not dumb, enjoy the ride
---
No when I go to Eris it doesn't complete
---
As in, purchased separate?
---
Agreed. This experience had a 2 year window too, if you sit on your hands you miss out on stuff.
---
I don't think there's a fix. Bungie directly said game sharing the pass wouldn't be allowed (here: [https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/253725678?sort=0&amp;page=0](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/253725678?sort=0&amp;page=0) ). I just don't have the season pass on the account I paid for and have activated.
---
Got three hours in before going to bed.
---
On the contrary, you are buffed to 750, not reduced to it. So if you had a character at, say 500, you magically gain levels too. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And, if this were still true, just start me through the campaigns then, don't just broadly unlock everything, or at least give me the option to choose how I start a new character
---
Yea I did already the first time it happened. Still no word back.
---
I just got new exotic hand canon I thought u get that when u hit lvl 35?
---
An Easter egg I guess?
---
Can‚Äôt you cross save between 2 Xbox accounts?
---
Just eververse. :(
---
Ive seen a different one, and i have no idea what it is. There is also a special knight at a certain location that "opens a path" when killed but i cant find whatever it opens
---
Yes.
---
Yup. Getting to play it for two years before it went free.
---
What kind of a knuckle dragger actually plays apex. Just give it up it lost to fort it‚Äôs
---
Yes. If you want the content in forsaken you need to buy it separately. Currently I think it‚Äôs $30? 
---
I did the same as you, so now I‚Äôm waiting for forsaken to drop to $20 or less before buying it . From what I have gathered, there isn‚Äôt anything in forsaken that is desperately needed right now.
---
As said above, new light came into effect today. 750 is basically the new starting level. They updated the graphics and a few extra things to make life easier.  You can check out the new updates on the bungie app. 
---
Basically nothing really changed except for things getting shifted, making things more organized, and a new destination + story line. Good luck guardian!
---
I got on after not playing since the first raid and I have no idea what I should keep and what I should be doing.
---
No he lacks a soul the halobunnys demand a sacrifice
---
I am having the same problem.
---
They made a fix on Hand Cannon animation.
---
Not just Ace. Other HC may give you the same feeling too
---
Yeah give me one mo and I'll have a few pics of the location (I suck at directions)
---
In my case it was a matter of logging into the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) app with the Google hot button (forgot I'd switched to using that at some point, because it's been a while since I had to log into this app) instead of the username and password I originally used with Destiny 2 way back when it was originally launched and for a couple years after.
---
In other words, if you've used more than one log-in method for the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) app, and one is not working, try the other one. Once I did this, it was a multiple step process, but everything worked this time.
---
Possibly have multiple steps
---
SYLOKKKKK
---
Hello guys, I've been trying all day to contact, Bungie or Steam without any success. This is due to the fact that regional pricing o steam is broken and Forsaken is atm more expensive than Shadowkeep in countries like Mexico (Brazil and India). And I really would ike to buy Forsaken, but not when it is even more expensive than in the US. Where should I go, I just want to know if it is indeed working as intended or not. But kno one has even aknowledge the issue.  
---
Here is an image, Mexico Usually is cheaper than Russia, but know we are first world apparently.
---
Same issue smh
---
Bro where the fucks taken king shit show #1
---
Wut üòí? I mean I have all that Black Armory has to offer but now it means I can only forge certain weapons. What cycle is the rotation on? Daily? Please don‚Äôt say Weekly.
---
Its like the cat. I found a legendary consumable called a rice cake from the helium coils and i gave it to him. It gave me 9 of the blue fragments
---
My guess is the tangled shore, or the ship lady at the tower. She has the quests for all the old campaigns to do if you want but I‚Äôm not sure if forsaken is included in fhag
---
I have and I figured it was similar, I just didn‚Äôt know if anyone figured out what we need to offer up to them
---
Destiny has never had local talk. Whishper, Party and clan chat are available.
---
Personally, I found local chat unnecessary. 
---
Trust me! It may save you some headache
---
Yep same thing happened to me I'm not spending 30 more dollars for something I already paid for its ridiculous
---
Game share no longer works with seasons as it‚Äôs tied to your bungie account, not a content license.
---
Its like the cat. I found a legendary consumable from the helium coils called a rice cake. I offered it to him snd he gave me 9 blue fragments
---
Right, but what do we need to offer them and how many are there? I found this one near the hellmouth
---
But it literally has a local channel?
---
For me it seems it got a lot easier to shoot but, then again it could be the whiskey and weed making it that way. However since we are fighting the hive right now I been using sunshot nothing like watching everything explode in pure hellfire. also it's fire week so easy mode.
---
This is a joke on bungie's part and I honestly dont think I'm going to support this game anymore
---
The deluxe edition is a larger size but it should only be 30ish gb. Unfortunately i don‚Äôt know why it would be 120gb
---
H D R? You must be wuna them fancy shmancy people's playin with a vidya card.
---
Errm, but seriously, I play with it off.
---
I'm experiencing similar issues. Been trying for 2 hours to figure out what's causing it lol. I've updated my gfx driver, tried all settings, tried a different SSD. 
---
Intel Core i5 6402P
---
AMD Radeon RX 480
---
For decoration, yes lol
---
Spec? If you mean subclass, Dawnblade and Stormcaller have been rocking it out for quite a bit.
---
You can only equip ornaments on armor 2.0
---
Wow. All this time and I couldn't figure that out. xD
---
Thanks, m8. Will get to that ASAP
---
Yeah I've played destiny since the d1 alpha and loved it ever since but with all the eververse bs and now this I'm just about on the last straw
---
You need to do all the baron adventures
---
Ok I was not able to pick up a forsaken quest on PC, I switched to Xbox, was able to pick up the quest, switched back to PC, still had the quest in my log.  So that seemed ok, the second part of the quest (exotic bow) takes you to a strike that I‚Äôll probably have to do on xbox, but seems to be a work around if you own forsaken on one platform but not the other.  
---
Just will need to switch a bunch
---
In one of the cracks in the hell mouth I think the big bottom one
---
You are probably supposed to do some of his bounties, I don‚Äôt really remember that well though
---
No idea yet but someone here has found an offering near the end of the opening mission?!?!
---
Daily. 
---
I think you can forge anything in each Forge now since all these changes are in.
---
All, check your mailbox. Mine glitched to mailbox.
---
On reddit? No way!!!
---
I got the same problem, my friend is cross save from xbox dunno if that matters
---
How can I play the Forsaken Campaign? I already purchased the license but I can't seem to find the mission step from Amanda Holliday, as that's where other people said you can find it.
---
Feed it rice cake.
---
Pretty much exactly how I felt about my Warlock and Hunter. I didn't like how they looked and I wanted to have some Exo characters so I deleted and recreated them before Shadowkeep. I used up the free character boost on my recreated Warlock, but I didn't realize I only had the one boost when I tried boosting my Hunter, leading to me waiting until right now to play the Hunter
---
Best decision I've ever made. I like how the remastered mission is set up to be exactly like the original, but set *after* the events of the Red War and Forsaken so there's several tweaks. Gives off the feeling that you're a guardian following in the Young Wolf's shoes
---
Just killed the bitch.... again. You want a 4th round or is this finally enough.
---
Experiencing the same thing. Destiny ran like a champ on Bnet.  There is a definite loss of performance either with this update or with Steam.
---
Amanda Holliday has the Red War, Osiris and Warmind campaigns.
---
I paid for it, and it's completely irrelevant, so shut the fuck up with that. The intro to the game is completely different, isn't remotely as good as the normal story, you don't start at level 1 anymore, so the standard gameplay progression through the game's story doesn't even exist anymore. A massive chunk of the game, the most important part of the game is just gone now. How hard is that to understand? You think people downloaded Destiny just to play the trash PvP or endgame raids? Is that normal to you? People want to play through the actual game the way it was intended to be played through.
---
Ill try this and the other reply posted here. Ty!
---
i owe you my life
---
What I would recommend is completing the free to play and see how you like the game and the mechanics. At that point if you are concerned about the story and want it in order, get forsaken and then shadowkeep. If you just want to play the newest thing and be up to date with just that, then go for shadowkeep.
---
I've heard if you do that it makes a picture of the final boss; cthulu-garfield.
---
At least in my case, we were all playing on PC so I don't think that would matter much.
---
Have you tried checking your collections?
---
New bounty Which moon‚Äôs haunted.
---
Que?
---
You can carry more than 28. You‚Äôre capped off at the 5 per vendor
---
Niiiiiice
---
How did u get in to d2?
---
Its working. No long wait times anymore
---
 Ay least on ps4. I just got off
---
Why mess with something that was working fine?  I like the launch from orbit option but I like running Bergusia.  So now I'm gonna go carry some kids through Volunder I guess.  GG Bungie.
---
Yeah but they werent so I made maymay
---
I wonder if you use a VPN you can get it much much cheaper.
---
Agreed
---
If you want to be immersed in the story, then play the campaigns in order of release (red war, Curse of Osiris, Warmind, Forsaken, and then Shadowkeep). The campaigns should introduce you to the areas you've never been before (ex: the forsaken campaign will introduce you to the tangled shore and dreaming city). There is no way to progress from power level 0 and the new power level floor is 750. The reason for this is so that new players can immediately jump into the new content if they wanted to because most people want to be able to play what they paid money for. It may seem less immersive to the game, but it saves them from a ton of backlash. When the Black Armory dlc came out, Bungie got huge hate because players had to play old content to get power just to play the new content. Players felt restricted from content they just paid for, so you can imagine that if people had to start from level 0 and power level 0, they'd be locked out of shadowkeep content for, at the very minimum, 8 hours PER character. Also given the history of the game where Bungie has literally avoided the term "MMO" for years until now, I think it's just them finally embracing it now, albeit it may be a bit overboard and I would agree that maybe they could have given an option for players to opt into the boost or not.
---
No problem. I am currently at the location and will stay here till 210am est for anyone who wants to get it if no one msg's me on xbox b4 or by then I will be leaving. I will sit here to help people get it just msg me and I will inv you GT is SSGVegeta71682
---
I guess I was in the wrong part of the forum. It let me post hopefully I can get answers. Can i make another account somehow?
---
I can see where you're coming from but that would make picking up legendary armor rather pointless. I mean if that were the case then thay would mean you would have to earn a base set of armor, some of which has perks for specific activities, and then earn the ornaments. I'm not sure I want to grind for a whole bunch of ornaments.
---
Though I wouldn't mind if all the blur armor became ornaments. There is a lot of the blue armor that looks better than most of the legendary armor.
---
high value target in the anchor of light
---
Go talk to Amanda Holliday in the Tower hangar. She‚Äôll grant you access to the Red War, Curse of Osiris, and Warmind campaigns :)
---
Why
---
Its been playable pretty much all evening.
---
Yes! The 63,390th time this shit has been posted in less than 12 hours!
---
Why not?
---
Thanks for the PSA. I hope they fix it. I remember when /join was broken I had to add like 100 people then delete them...
---
The meme? Or the subject of the queue?
---
I got it about 3-4 hours ago
---
Well that means there is more than one. I found another one over by the Hallmouth looking for regional chests.
---
They said they won't do anything about it I'm sorry
---
Nope, you can jump into shadowkeep content (assuming you purchased it) if you'd like.
---
Wait I played all that I‚Äôm talking about up until forsaken but not after.
---
You're welcome.
---
This was all explained BEFORE shadowkeep dropped
---
Wow you are a good man.
---
Played for a few hours tonight.
---
From what I gather they said they won't do anything and basically are saying it's our mistake
---
much appreciated! the more we know about how armor can roll, the better we can min/max and not accidentally trash that god roll we got on day one... \*erentil intensifies\*
---
I finished that like 5-6 hours ago
---
Every internet point is appreciated. We beat those darn weasels into submission! Together we hunted them out :D
---
Yes you can but it Will be dificult to find players for raids and other activities
---
Its better to be in a clan as we all help each other out but its not necessary
---
I really do need your guy's help. I feel powerless and small.. I tried getting a refund from PS only to be met with a chat support guy telling me I can't cause I downloaded it. I couldn't have known of the problem until I did download it.
---
Yes! I had D2 Year 1 on Xbox. Got curious with Forsaken once I got a PC and bought it on Blizzard (sadly, I didn‚Äôt even play it lol because no homies)
---
But, with the recent transfer, I did the cross save thing while linking my accounts, I transferred my xbox account since I had more stuff‚Äîand sure enough, my xbox characters transferred along with the forsaken dlc from blizzard. 
---
Be that as it may, my 1,000 silver did not transfer or merge from blizzard.
---
Just proved my point?
---
Well done. This was well thought out. Have a like sir.
---
Pretty much. Here is IGN's 25 minute play through of First Light:
---
https://youtu.be/c2ebBrn3_kE
---
Like I said in the comments. In my day you had to play multiple missions before you could double jump.
---
Yeah I did Savathun's Song twice and neither time worked.
---
Yes, but we did do EXACTLY as they said. I did my cross save. Except it didn't for me or a lot of other people.
---
It‚Äôs from season of opulence, not a spoiler. Just search it up on google to find the locations.
---
As far as I know there is no way to start from scratch. I‚Äôm also affected by this issue as I loved the progression and this update has ruined the main goal for me as I can‚Äôt progress as I normally did.
---
While the rest of us waited in queue...
---
I got it too while doing pain and gain exotic quest
---
What?
---
N           I           C           E
---
Thank you for your explanation, I agree that It would be nice if we could have avoided the boost because it seems a bit ridiculous to put new players up so high and into content they should have not yet seen. Maybe having the option of having a boosted new account vs a fresh level 0 one? There's a lot less motivation to climb now that high-level gear has just been handed to me
---
What‚Äôs the name of the weapon?
---
Make that 15
---
Try and look up a number for bungie themselves, not even specifically for D2. Shoot them an email if you can find it. Maybe even call Microsoft and see if they have a number you can use.
---
I really hope you get to play man. Despite all the normal garbage that goes with large games, in total I think D2 is a masterwork
---
He actually said that, but cap said it too in endgame
---
Guys I have a theory each of the planets and the pyramid ship signifies each dlcs theme and location I think so far that the ships have to do with season of the undying with the vex
---
Small Rice Cake, I have one but didn‚Äôt know who to give it to! Where is it?
---
Nah this is well worth the 30 your get shadow and season of the undying the campaign is a solid 8 the quests are overwhelming and for once i have some sort of pressure trying to hit that 950 before Saturday but 902 looks good rn ngl
---
Yeah I've seen that man. But yeah I am ha
---
The only bad thing is the grind but the gameplay has no equal imo.
---
Menagerie.

---
Did you try this before?
---
It's Bungies servers, nothing you can do your end
---
And the campaign
---
you can pick up rice cakes from helium filament piles on the moon, then offer them like you would with the cats from the dreaming city
---
I found a good cheese method, log on during times that people are normally sleeping. I log in at 6/7am nice and clean.
---
I wish they at least just didn't drop the story like that until the raid. Not cool bungie.
---
Confirmed, acolyte hvt in anchor of light
---
Does anyone know how I "claim the triumph" for this? I completed the  nightfall but there isn't a reward to turn in to anyone at the tower. 
---
Thanks in advance.
---
Unfortunately it did not work for me. Changed to 4 letters, reloged and still can‚Äôt get in. Rip
---
Too late
---
Of the 120 min ‚Äúonline‚Äù, I could only play two strikes.. that‚Äôs it.
---
That's not infrequently the case. Story matters. This is why the games I've loved the most all have had great stories, like SWTOR. The first 50 levels of gameplay (the original) was outstanding. Truly gripping stuff, and you felt like you were actually part of the evolving story. Then the fun just stopped once the story did and it was all grind. But hey, at least I'll get to enjoy the campaign on this one!
---
Fixed it.  
---
Close Steam  
---
Go to
---
C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam    and delete everything in the depotcache folder.
---
Go to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steamapps   and do the same.
---
Now log back into steam.
---
I did the same thing and went through the same process and nothing seems to have happened to me as well.. i‚Äôm sure something of our offerings will come about lol
---
Its true though, every planet i've played on tonight has been full, it's a great thing to see :D
---
Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs free but this also could‚Äôve been answered by google, anyway go into the hangar and talk to Amanda Holliday. That‚Äôs pretty much it.
---
Sums up my experience so far
---
Mhm I'd recommend putting your items you wanna keep into vault first
---
Undead Michael Jackson confirmed raid boss
---
Not sure what's surprising there? The game devs (or rather publishers) want a steady income stream. As long as they have that, and producing more content keeps the money flowing, they'll keep adding stuff, and of course they want to add quality stuff to make sure the gravy train doesn't stop. 
---
But sooner or later any title will age out, and people will no longer want to play in droves, so they try to eke out more money out of it with lower quality addons that cost them less to make but still allows them to squeeze the last blood out of the stone (or player base). 
---
The last stage is free to play and sucking money out of us cheapskates who didn't want to pay up front, but don't mind grabbing it for free and logging in and playing; if you get hooked, you extend their gravy train by microtransactions and thus keep the game alive a little longer.
---
See if devrim has it as you may have accidently deleted it and he'll have it
---
Talk to Amamda Holliday in the Hangar to do the base game quest plus both DLC quests. From there, grind strikes and crucible for gear and find groups to run raids.
---
I just checked devein but I can double check
---
Doing it manually from a specific planet didn't seem to work but getting a hive strike randomly from the playlist counted. It was a new one on the Moon but I don't know if that was what did it instead.
---
I've seen near Eris there's like a bowl in a table , i haven't tried yet but my idea was to place the ball on that bowl, can't wait  to get home and try it after work :P
---
Ah OK if he doesn't have it try switching characters or restarting or if push comes to shove do it on someone else
---
Its just the race that is in the pyramids known by the community as The Veil. These guys are the antithesis of the light. Real baddies and they seem to be more religious about the darkness. Well fight them next expansion or D3.
---
Moons low key haunted
---
I Kota looks like Aang lol
---
Have already tried:
---
‚Ä¢ Verifying integrity of game files
---
‚Ä¢ Changing steam name to one that is simpler (no special characters) and reloging
---
As long as it shows your character on bungo.net you're good.
---
Sorry but i am spiteful today so screw you i am now sad
---
U have not made my day
---
Talk to everyone at the tower. One of the quests gives you Sparrow .
---
Wait 27000 people play were playing destiny!? We did it boys, we've doubled our player base!
---
Go find armor 2.0 gear then.
---
Thanks but i already did but havent gotten a reply yet. I dont expect to soon since theres probably a million problems rn.
---
I think I‚Äôm the first person to get the ace of spades catalyst I got it 10 minutes from the game the opening
---
Premium track will only show armor for the current character you are on but each character can obtain their own armor from the track. Other stuff like glimmer and materials can only be obtained once per account.
---
Well, they didn't want new players to be forced going through 2 years of content before they can jump into moon's haunted.
---
Online game innit
---
Just wanna make sure I got this right.... so.... Go to the hellmouth, then go down. Go inside and look around, then go down. There will be a path to choose, go down that path. Then go down to go down the path to go down the path that's next to the other path, and boom. It's that easy, right? Oh wait, or was it left...?
---
I played a few main campaign missions last night and got items above the default 750 power. :S
---
For the story missions just go at the Tower and talk to Amanda
---
I will, though with the strikes seemingly not having any weekly bounties I'm not sure what I'm meant to do in order to find better armor. Or where to grind the tangled web set for a fourth time.
---
Thanks for the answer but my query is about titan and if it"s still the weakest class.
---
As i said, i'm willing to spend the time to try out D2  again.
---
For some reason Bungie decided to throw new players directly into endgame content.
---
 
---
You have to go talk to Amanda Holliday to unlock the story campaigns.
---
Yeah but other online free to play games do not require psplus....
---
This is pretty normal, it's basically a re release of destiny with way more players. Was already expecting overpopulation.
---
Ah okay, but where can i continue the campain i was playin earlier?
---
It‚Äôs definitely worth it, I haven‚Äôt played it all yet but the first 5-6 missions I‚Äôve played have been by far some of the best in franchise history.  Hope to see you there guardian!
---
Sorry for your terrible internet. Only took me 3 hours.
---
Showing as Legacy, but it seems like its going to start me off from the beginning again?  
---
  
---
Is there no way to carry on from where I left off?
---
Look in your vault, everything there is 750 as well.
---
same :(((
---
Go to Amanda at the tower
---
Where abouts is it located
---
Talk to Amanda Holliday at the Tower. She offers quests that take you through the original Red War campaign, and the quests for the Osiris and Warmind DLCs.
---
Trash opinion coming from a person trashy enough to waste their time to make comments on a game they don't like.
---
The secret room in the hangar
---
How are they liars? They never claimed forsaken was free
---
Where do you pick up the quest for the catalyst
---
Maybe equip the jade rabbit emblem thing if that still exists?
---
This happened to me.
---
No mate it should of transferred I just checked
---
You got the game
---
Shadowkeep is 100% worth it. I had the most fun I have had in a long time in the first few missions I played through. The story is amazing and the moon is hella nostalgic for me
---
it's already applied in the screenshot
---
/ I wish I could have Dragonfly on a Sword and hit crits, but yeah that Dragonfly Spec isn't doing much this way
---
I think his answer makes sense, i don't know what you're so confused about.
---
At daddy shaxx
---
Rest of the community spends well over $200 on content and then comes on Reddit to hear babies whining about getting$200 worth of content for free.... SMFH
---
Oh I see thanks! Rip shards then I guess
---
Its all coming together.......
---
Idk look in the director
---
Someone told me that it won‚Äôt appear on the store unless you have the Osiris and warmind. I‚Äôm looking to get it myself.
---
The free to play should have launched the day or week after...
---
So the same game everyone who just press "Play for free" on steam has?  
---
Or do we have a little bit more?
---
I haven't played since me and the boys finished the first raid in season 1, randomly my Hunter was 750 but my Titan and warlock were both 668 or something. Super sad cause I wanted to play my titan
---
Well... no?
---
So are Shadowkeep and the free2play game still on the same servers ?
---
Check your event viewer for info ..
---
Without info there's not much help ppl can provide
---
Where do you think all the black goo on her face came from?
---
Ok I'm sorry
---
Empty Slots
---
I‚Äôm here for the last 2 years and I believe most of us are too...
---
I‚Äôm very happy with the game going for free and moved to steam, I‚Äôm also very happy to see new players on the game, friends playing and having a lot of fun together 
---
Destiny is way more than grind and be stronger just to kill things easily and most of the dlcs that they release they give a boost to help players that doesnot have the light/power have the opportunity to enjoy the content as everybody that was playing does. You are a new player and I understand your point of view but destiny works in a different way and I just wanted you to understand. Eyes up guardian, go to the moon and hunt those freaking nightmares!
---
Not everyone has unlimited time to play this game I have responsibilities in life as many other people do and I don‚Äôt appreciate having 8 hours wasted. They could of staggered releases like they did previously. It‚Äôs not a case of growing up it‚Äôs a case of doing business and communicating with your customers properly. They told me when the game would be playable I made time around that. If they said it‚Äôs live on October 1st then I expect to be able to play on October 1st. It‚Äôs called sticking to your word. And the fact you accept this bullshit is simply because your so heavily invested in the game physically (as in time). By your standards maybe it‚Äôs acceptable but not mine.
---
do I need ps plus to play it?
---
A youtuber, makes brilliant lore videos.
---
Welcome to every single game every created groups of friends fall in and out of games all the time, the only games that can hold for a long time is games like LOL and fortnite games that give instant gratification with little to no barriers.
---
It's bugged for veteran players. It's in the patch notes.
---
My friends and I all just broke 910. After getting to 900, we did the nightmare hunts on the moon, vanguard strike and crucible challenges, and then worked through most of the quests we had received at the start of the day. The first quest we did was "the memory of Sai moto" (or something like that) when you finish it you receive a powerful exotic. The next quest lead of through the nightfall: the ordeal, when you complete a NF:the ordeal at legend level, you get a powerful legendary that'll boost you a bit as well.
---
Hopefully while you're working through these you'll also get some prime engrams and exotics to drop, to help you on your leveling adventure. Hopefully this kinda helps you :)
---
I haven‚Äôt watched it getter but jeez man it‚Äôs day 2 not everyone has played it. Plz mark spoiler just Incase.
---
My friend managed to get killed by broccoli.
---
I keep telling him to eat his veggies.
---
oh well, thanks then.
---
You may need to pick the quest with Amanda Holliday, that is now holding the beginning of most story arcs in her inventory.
---
Other than that, you shouldn't have any more problems.
---
I don't know. But think you need it.
---
Ok, yea, thank you.
---
Fix the friends limit on steam lul
---
Wait then when is your power level capped?
---
Thanks
---
As a newcomer I appreciate this welcoming post. Most gaming communities are very toxic about new players jumping on late in the game. I‚Äôm a longtime Halo fan and just recently got a PS4 so I‚Äôve missed a lot since the Xbox 360 days.
---
Sad indeed
---
Lol attack of the Bungie fan boys got me good. Thanks
---
I‚Äôm sad now
---
You know how you hold B to activate your rally barricade or wall? And if you don't hold B for long enough you just crouch? Do that just with your super buttons.
---
thanks everyone
---
ÂìÅÁâåËßÄÁúã?
---
My friend got that issue. He fixed it by passing ports on his router manually cause UPnP won't work
---
Well, they've been up and down all day, so yeah, it's been pretty crap. I don't particularly care, but the sheer stupidity of the fanboiism is nauseating.
---
wow thanks man. i feel like a idiot
---
man this hurts me and my potential karma
---
Dude. I work a 9-5 with a two hour commute. You're preaching to the choir. The difference between us is I dont whine about things that dont go the way I want them to because that's life. Grow. Up.
---
Ahhh maybe not, damn, I know many people in the EU are having the same issue so maybe it‚Äôs just an EU thing and I should just wait till I‚Äôve got time off again next week
---
Yes. Enabling UPnP on my Router v√≠a the browser did absolutely nothing. I‚Äôm going to have to do that but I can‚Äôt find a decent tutorial in order to do so without messing up my internet. 
---
Thanks for confirming that that is the solution tho (;
---
thank you
---
I'm sorry event viewer?
---
Servers are messed up due to a massive influx of players. It'll calm down in a few days.
---
i had my gear all at 901 before i got a prime or any tier one legendary drops and im saving the nf for after im done the tier 1 legendary drops and using the exotic rocket quest to boost my tier one drops higher to catapult the nightfall reward much higher in hopes to transfer a high weapon to character two.
---
That vibe where if you‚Äôre having a problem with the game you‚Äôre the problem because bungie are perfect and if you say anything bad then your instantly downvoted because everyone is so physically invested in the game that they don‚Äôt want the game to die or do badly so anything negative is therefor a threat and must be treated with downvoted and negativity, that kinda vibe :)
---
I stayed up maaan
---
Well I hope you get to experience the problem or one similar :)
---
Ohngod... Noooo...
---
Laughs In Bali - won‚Äôt have this problem until I get back from honeymoon
---
When I played on my 1060 I had to turn my settings down to low and medium. No v-sync, turn down the shadows, and personally I'd rather a locked frame rate (I found it more jarring to go from 100+ frames down to 50 which will happen). The game is really well optimized, on low settings the game still looks great but, destiny still is kinda hard to run. My 2080 has troubles holding above 100 fps with everything turned up.
---
Fortnite was already trash once they added vehicles into the game
---
Idk where but I found a figure but it told me "you lack something" so I couldn't do anything with it. Mabby like the cat statues in the dreaming city?
---
I can't even launch the game. I gave to get through school first :(
---
As in loot? No but its pretty good as a story
---
Ok... so as a new player what do you recommend I do first to start gaining better stuff?
---
No extra purchase necessary. Bows are just a random drop from activities, with some activities having a higher drop chance. I‚Äôve gotten a few doing Gambit matches (PvP) and a few from strikes.
---
I've boughten both forsaken deluxe and shadowkeep deluxe when they released. I havent played since pc launch. Maybe I'll play this time :/
---
Ok thanks bud
---
Ohhhh I get you, the armor 2.0 system
---
Spoiler
---
Its rice cakes that are used for the bunny
---
Same. My framerate dropped from 60+ on the bnet client to 30-40 FPS on steam.
---
Also had that problem.
---
Close Steam and go to the folder where you have installed Steam. There's a folder called "depotcache". Delete everything in there. Next you go to steamapps and theres another folder called "depotcache". Delete also everything in there.
---
After that open Steam again and it should work.
---
I don't understand - they asked "who's there", but did not recognize the given name of their visitor. Why do they ask for a family name, instead of simply opening the door and identifying them? Humans and their foolish games.
---
Thx for the reply, at least i know i can reach top rating without exp
---
You could apply useless mods to weapons before Shadowkeep. I've seen people with Dragonfly Spec on weapons without Dragonfly and Rampage Spec on weapons without Rampage for months.
---
Go to underside of the green jump puzzle room in the whisper mission. And then after you finish the catalyst in like two hours, find something new to complain about
---
Bro it‚Äôs so easy just go to mars and start an escalation protocol kill thrall
---
yeah but popular youtube man no like :(
---
Sorry for the ignorance but that‚Äôs that? The DMZ.
---
but on Swords? I thought that wasn't possible until now
---
Blues become pointless later on so there‚Äôs not any reasoning
---
I cant believe I've never though of ep
---
You familiar with the green room in the whisper quest? Makes most catalysts a bit quicker.
---
you're both awful
---
BUTTERFLY!
---
Have you played shadowkeep? As far as i can tell others say its pretty bad and you seem to get most stuff with forsaken anyways
---
I still think it should‚Äôve been a choice if they wanted to do that or not
---
If I'm just interested in pvp do I have to touch pve at all?
---
Where is the green room because I haven't done wisper in quite a while
---
I did that before i got the quest i think. I'm guessing it wants me to do his bounties only so I have to wait till the next round of dailys
---
Thanks bro~‚òÜ
---
better one than none though!  over the course of my 10 1/2 hour all nighter i picked up the riskrunner cat (can‚Äôt really remember how, something to do with a cayde stash) the prometheus cat (from a hero level nightfall ordeal completion) and the cerberus +1 cat (consumable that dropped from a red bar enemy in the middle of a normal nightfall).  i don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs raining catalysts all of a sudden but i‚Äôm not gonna complain.  i gotta go to the zoo with my buddy and his fianc√© and family though.  Good luck fellow guardian(s)!  hope your mate gets that cat though!
---
Is 900 the easy leveling cap? Then 960 is the powerful cap?
---
Yep I died here and cussed so hard because I thought I had to start over.
---
I see your point, I don‚Äôt want to come across as begging for anything I was just wondering if there was anything like that
---
So I played vanilla D2 and guess I played what is called the Red War campaign (x3), KO'd Ghaul (who should have been the first Raid / first Raid boss IMO, not a story ender, but hey, nobody asked me).
---
I left not getting/playing Osiris and don't hear much good about it.  Should I head to Warmind or ?
---
I'm guessing I need to possibly delete characters to get the level upgrade / access this new hub/stuff or ?
---
release day d2 beats midweek fortnite
---
d2 fans: "see not ded game"
---
methinks the lady doth protest too much
---
Try ButterflyTsunami
---
I had poison as well, so many people have the same website. Which means that everyone needs to put their collector's edition code in.
---
It‚Äôs just karma whore attempts the day later. They will start to fizzle soon.
---
Movement: W, A, S, D (directions), Shift (Toggle Sprint), Ctrl (Toogle Crouch), Space (Jump)
---
Abilities: Q (Grenade), E (Class ability), Mouse button 4 (Melee) Mouse button 5 (Finisher), F (Super)
---
General: V (Interact), Tab (Ghost on tap, Director on Hold), M (Map), C (Character Page), 1 through 3 numbers (Change weapons), R (Reload), Right Click (Toogle Aiming Down Sights), Left Button (Trigger)
---
That is what I remember right now, I'm away from my pc. Also, I do have a 12 button mouse and I do have alternate buttons there for Reload, Changing weapons, Grenade, class ability and super, but I didn't got used to them yet, so I mostly use the keybinds described.
---
I don't have time to explain what has now become free in this game.
---
Yeah... I didn‚Äôt think Butt was a sensor thing as it‚Äôs a body part
---
Touche
---
I've got only one hour before the server crashed and it was already today in europe :/
---
[WISH ENDER] I spoke to the statue now and it said "new mission added" but we didnt kill the last boss.
---
Where do i have to go now?
---
The quest for the wish ender also disappeared..
---
Well you can at the right time. This one is nice and polished and I‚Äôm excited because a lot of content still yet to drop. Have fun.
---
Nice
---
It's not working if you just straight out copy the files and run it. Still have to download the new light files
---
F2P player here, I played a bit around November last year and came back for New Light. What are some low-effort legendaries and exotics I should look for so I'm not entirely helpless in PvP?
---
950 is powerful cap and 960 is pinnacle cap. Pinnacle= needing raid/iron banner drops.
---
Literally any activity. Best thing imo is to play the campaigns in order.
---
This warms my heart.
---
This was posted ages ago
---
Oh shit oh fuck oh shit oh fuck
---
Do the campaign. Try and get onto titan as quick as possible, you'll be able to choose between three armor exotics. After that try and get through the campaign to get to nessus where you'll get to choose between riskrunner, sunshot and graviton lance (i'd personally pick riskrunner if you don't have it, otherwise the choice is entirely yours). After that you can play through more of the campaign and complete it to get some cosmetic loot which is pretty cool, along with a sword depending on your class, although the swords aren't year 3 or year 2 weapons. I think you also get an exotic engram at the end which is pretty nice. Also the base campaign is pretty good and it's got a fairly decent plot with good gameplay.
---
That is correct.
---
Just wait until next week. üòÇüòÇ
---
cool story bro
---
To what I have heard yes
---
Oh boo hoo you had to wait a few extra hours you entitled motherfucker. They had the most concurrent players in their history, you think they were prepared for something like that? Plus, they stayed in constant communication with us and we're working as hard and fast as they could to get it up again.
---
Every character is scale to 750, even the new light ones.
---
Dude thats a massive ass spoiler
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt think I understand gaming culture. I‚Äôm fairly new to it. I get not liking it; it‚Äôs not my cup of tea as far as games go, but the memes about it confuse me. My son plays it though and the devs have at least kept it fresh for players, so I don‚Äôt get what there is to hate. Minecraft isn‚Äôt my cup of tea either but I don‚Äôt hold this vitriol against it because it‚Äôs massively popular. That seems to be the god tier game in meme culture. I‚Äôm also not the target demo nor did I grow up playing it but it‚Äôs amazing the power of nostalgia and the power of hate boners.
---
That's not on destiny man, all online games require the playstation online service to use
---
It's 'should have', never 'should of'.
---
Rejoice, for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot!
---
The Fallout guy at the bottom makes the picture
---
I think you completely misunderstand what Free to Play means. The game is free. Sony charges you to play online, not Bungie. That's just their policy for Triple A games
---
Hrmm, but it was only 30 bucks lol.  IDK I thought the main thing was the new elements nothing to do with areas and new enemies.  I feel like that's more of a new title type thing.  But like I said I am just a casual player lol but thanks for the information though.
---
Pro tip: Go to the "Green Room" in the Whisper of the Worm mission. Underground, bands of thralls spawn endlessly. Wait until they're packed and pop one in the head. The watch the fireworks.
---
Rinse and repeat. Shouldn't take more than 30 mins.
---
I played vanilla on PS4 2 years ago at launch but since then i haven‚Äôt played. Now I‚Äôm on pc and looking to get back into it and play warmind, forsaken and all the other new content. 
---
I‚Äôll be honest, I was a bit underwhelmed with vanilla but d2 seems to have improved significantly now!
---
Oh I know, I was just having fun with an overused and abused D1 line.
---
Thanks, Jack.  That's actually the spot I'm referring to.  The chest ISN'T on the desk. :(
---
The fact is I paid 60$ while other people don't have to, that is 60$ that I could have just not spent. Therefore it would be nice if they recognized that and give us a special thank you item or something.
---
Cool. Thanks.
---
looks like im windows mode. if i go to check the internet or something, the game goes to 30.  
---
nevermind :/
---
No. You can‚Äôt go to the moon without shadowkeep. You can farm to 900/950 I think without it
---
I am on asian servers so the game says "no clan roster available"
---
Don‚Äôt claim anymore triumphs
---
That's actually a bit crazy as no other set of DLC or expansion has done this but I do hope Bungie addresses this soon or tells people about it.
---
It‚Äôs easy? Dude it‚Äôs one of the hardest games I‚Äôve ever played. I‚Äôve been playing since the day it came out and still get clapped regularly by players with just insane levels of skill. 
---
Building, editing, shooting, zone awareness all come into play and create a super high skill ceiling.
---
Have you even played the game or are you just shitting on it blindly?
---
And there's a terminal behind morn that activates another terminal I've found three in the direction of Archer's line and maybe we have to finish the tire game and that other game where you bet those gray things to turn on more terminals
---
Anyone had this happen to them? It just went away after I finished the mission on my other character. Not sure what this is tied too...
---
Having a laptop not working correctly isn't close enough of a reason to say it is D2 related, otherwise you could take any piece of technology that isn't working and just post it here saying it is related.
---
Wow, no Korok seed for that one?
---
I meet this two guys and we strikes for like 2 hours they were veterans put I was holding my own got tell light level 800 got a dope legendary sniper life's good so far
---
What about my level, I think I was still 25 when I was doing the main story quest.
---
ya maybe it's made for casuals and none story/mmo lovers. I like to play all content if it's my first time and not skipping everything, knowing shit about lore, story, my class..
---
It's the message on the screen, saying it's taking longer than expected due to issues.
---
FARTNITE BAD, PRAISE GERALDO
---
In every genre as well. When WoW launches a new expansion or a major patch it's number 1. When Overwatch releases a new hero or map, its number 1. When fuckin ANY game that is moderately popular does a big patch or expansion or change it will be number 1. This post is bad and the OP should feel bad.
---
A fine art
---
I'm still a fan of dinklebot.  And I want the original D1 story.  So yeah...
---
Rip 15k glimmer lol
---
That's where I found mine in a little crevice near a death pit close to the hell mouth, I think those purple tarps are like beacons or indicators of their location
---
I got the cerberus catalyst while doing a nightmare hunt
---
*breathes in*
---
#FORTNITE BAD
---
Upvotes to the left please
---
You need a the capacity for it
---
Good suggestions. I haven't added Steam as an exception in my antivirus but will look into that.
---
I also suspect it's a Steam problem and not a Destiny 2 problem, but it's only happening with Destiny 2. I have seen a few other comments explaining this same issue with Destiny 2 on Steam's discussion forums, but there are no solutions there yet.
---
Enjoy your 1 hours of being more watched before your shit game is dead again :)
---
I can't get companion, little light, or ishtar to work.
---
‚Ä¢750 light is the new zero basically. I'm not entirely sure if you will be able to go up to 900+ without shadow keep. 
---
‚Ä¢Keep all materials. You need them for everything. You can hold 999 before making a new stack. Glimmer (250k) you get constantly and use constantly. 
---
‚Ä¢Yellow weapons and armor are exotics. You can have one of each equipped. (One armor piece. One weapon.) Different handcannons are better for different things. Did you want a pve or pvp weapon? Scouts got a buff in Pve, but I wouldn't recommend them for PvP. Try out a sniper or pluse rifle for pvp. 
---
‚Ä¢Gambit is a really fun game mode. (bungie made the vets grind it over and over ,so we all burned out on it. However, it Is fun to play if you're new.) 
---
-Light level only comes into play when you invade and when you're being invaded. You get one shot either way, so I wouldn't worry too much about it. Focus on killing things and collecting motes while you're max light level team mates invades. All of the little enemies running around that aren't actual players will adjust to your light level.
---
Cabal on the field
---
Oh, I'm an idiot
---
Go to Amanda Holliday in the hangar and you will be able to start them
---
Actually they did. Last November / December Warmind and Osiris would be included with Forsaken. All who bought them before got some ingame items like an emblem and shader.
---
Yes, it's true, it came back
---
I mean it‚Äôs like buying something then it goes on sale in two weeks, honestly just the luck of the draw.
---
Some people at least got it, here, this is what I'm saying the message is similar to https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fdavidthier%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FEF0aTHLXYAI5ZcE-1200x675.jpg
---
Thank you so much that was really helpful ! I was ver confused about the loadout part . Is it possible to get all kinds of weapons such as snipers by just playing pvp ?
---
So do I just keep upgrading it till it shows up in the mod selection I got it to 8
---
I can't even connect, so I'm gonna try being new another time
---
Enjoy fellow guardian!! Did you play on console before?
---
Or play "Crucible" against others in PvP. Maybe that's what you mean in lieu of partying up.
---
So there is a new type of enemy
---
You get the joy of seeing new guardians play the game. There's no need for a reward for paying for the game.
---
*gasp*
---
HOW DARE YOU???
---
nice.
---
Are you at 900 power? When we reach 900, things like the Flashpoint ( EDZ ) appear. That sounds like a weekly powerful reward challenge.
---
Yh season pass is account locked lol
---
When I first played adventures popped up on the tangled shore. Now there's none.  I mean the orange sword emblem kind.
---
Nah man it doesn't. Everything Forsaken related has REQUIRES FORSAKEN on it.
---
lol, I just got the image of burnt toast with the words "shadowkeep" written on it.
---
thanks, i only play PvE actually since i come to this game to get the tilt from overwatch away 
---
can you explain more about the invasions? that sounds like a clan thing i have only play the original campaign and some public/heroic events
---
I got it on the blizzard launcher a long time back when it was free but never played it because I just found using two launchers annoying. Saw it for free on steam and thought I should give it a whirl.
---
One share = one prayer
---
One like = one hug
---
Yeah but.. forsaken is free fam.. check on your Xbox store it says it..
---
got it in 5 minutes just killing things
---
WE HAVE ENTERED A WAR WITH BASKETBALL
---
Why are you even on this sub if you think destiny is dead shit?
---
Youll get the content but not the battle pass thing. That is only per account. Id say tell him to help u buy yours and stop game sharing cause each new season gonna get its own battle pass.
---
Shame, would have been the perfect opportunity to get new players... And non ps4 players into the original story
---
Yep. I had a friend start f2p yesterday and had to explain everything. What's a bounty? Why does my quest ask me to do a bounty before I've unlocked bounties? What's an adevtnrue? What's going on? Etc
---
This is a great question. Anyone know?
---
*Haunted
---
Steam has it as a purchase for $25
---
Can u  how to do that
---
Last word is a quest now and you need forsaken to do it I think
---
Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?
---
There was no chest in the cave, just the router and the knight.
---
If you have enough vanguard and crucible tokens you can level up pretty fast. I made it to 860 just doing that

Hope you didn't do your powerful engram quests/challenges/rewards for the week my brother. Otherwise you're kinda stuck at 900 soft cap
---
I'm not sure. I've been doing Shadowkeep so I don't really know much about the New Light content.
---
Finallyyyy
---
Sure about that? You‚Äôre the only one to bring it up. Insecure much?
---
Interesting. If you find it again get some captures.
---
Pretty shit but what can you expect from this garbage franchise
---
I read this in Kelso's voice...and now I can't get it out of my head.
---
Help.
---
There were cut scenes?
---
Ahhh okay, my friend got the new light stuff as soon as he started, but he made his first character, but I transferred. Thanks though!
---
Getting Mida catalyst, getting the true glory emblem, unbroken title
---
Sheet, I‚Äôm not sure if I have or not, I probably have... oh well
---
I want lumina to be good so badly
---
That's what I'm looking for.  Before the update they showed on the tangled shore before I even went up against the barons. Now they're not there.
---
Thanks this worked!
---
Thats on Sony. Not bungie. You just got 200$ worth of content for free.
---
Any range is spicy gun range lol
---
yes i'm sure that I am not
---
It said "I thought we killed him" for me
---
If you already transferred your account to steam you're all good to accept.
---
Same I only have the 1???
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£he needs to check again and get his priorities straightened out seriously. Your friend is very very confused.
---
Meanwhile I can't even log in...
---
But that's a lowercase g ü§î
---
Yeah those are the only ways (I think?) to get meaningful progression beyond 900
---
Ah sorry I thought you meant you‚Äôre currently seeing the orange icon on the map my bad!
---
Yes, both are authenticated. During the initial setup, my XBOX account did show my two characters and I was able to get Steam set up. From that perspective it looked like everything was done correctly from my end.

Also, this type of post would fall under the loot/achievement rule.
---
Haha not really. That‚Äôs just what I thought of when I saw this in r/thanosdidnothingwrong
---
Try reading
---
grinding when u start is faster than destiny 1
---
if you‚Äôre brand new you‚Äôre going to be playing a lot to get from 700-900 and I would strongly recommend not just doing strikes because you‚Äôll burn out. Crucible is enjoyable and you can earn rewards from it albeit slower than strikes.
---
I would recommend you get the dlcs if you have the money and have played d1 and really liked it. If you haven‚Äôt then I would play through the main campaign of d2 first and if you enjoyed it, buy the dlcs and continue.
---
Definitely don‚Äôt do them till you get to 900
---
ITT: People not understanding that this meme is used ironically.
---
Also, this type of post would fall under the loot/achievement category. Congrats on the quick climb to 900!
---
Thank you so much it helped
---
I wonder if, like you can in the tower, you can kick it to specific places to unlock different balls until you get a super ball
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the max light is 900 so playing for the lore should get you some gear and I think you get an exotic for finishing the campaign,
---
I mean if you look it her team when she descended into the hellmouth
---
Is there any reason why they'd be gone?
---
We‚Äôre these just random drops for you?
---
I was looking online and I‚Äôve been seeing that you have to have the annual pass, but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs different from this seasons pass or not
---
Deluxe edition contains the season pass. And cross save doesn't get you the same content on all the platforms? At least it says you can acces everything on every platform as you get something.
---
Quest Items and Quests are in the same place. The quest for the Dreaming City is through the Awoken Talisman; there's lots of guides for that quest.
---
Hey! Great overview. Best I‚Äôve seen so far. Game has changed a bunch so I was wondering best ways to level.
---
The astronomical amount of right thomas has seen right know has thrown him in to tge happiest day of his life
---
SALVATION
---
It's always nice when your fireteam in rdm matchmaking actually gives a shit about you.
---
Yes. I worked so hard on the Exotic version in D1. I miss my Khvostov.
---
supers still wreck you but they‚Äôre pretty much like black ops 3 specialist weapons, you get it once or twice a match and can kill the entire enemy team with it if you don‚Äôt end up dying.
---
PvP feels like D1 pvp imo
---
I thought it would be Sony. Not blaming on Bungie or anything, but still kinda sucks have to pay to play a coop mission with friends. Really not fan of that, tbh. Anyway, I'll still play the story and all. But I hope for Sony to change that.
---
What i'm referring to is that i got the deluxe edition on my xbox but for some reason im not getting the season pass on the SAME platform and the SAME account.
---
We're in Season 8 right now. I think the API haven't been updated yet to allow the apps to pull down the proper information.
---
There is no queue to me, I just get straight weaseled.
---
You see him in the 1st mission of shadowkeep
---
On the one hand, I love it!  
---
On the other hand it fills me with anxiety and I hate it :D
---
Did you complete the seal and acquire the MMXIX title?
---
Same thing happened to me yesterday. I'd guess most people are on Luna. 
---
Then again, there's a massive influx of new players. But they'd be doing Red War stuff, wouldn't they?
---
Who hurt you?
---
No content was removed. You can still play the original campaign by talking to Amanda Holliday at the Tower.
---
Got chickened
---
Seasons passes are now tied to your bungie account instead of your ps account, so he can access shadowkeep because it is tied to your ps account but he can't access the seasons passes.
---
I am at exactly your place, want to play the story in the right order but can‚Äôt buy Forsaken on the PSN. For some reason I can‚Äôt find it anywere, even the evereststore just links to my download list for some reason.
---
Right there with you. At least I was able to skip the server issues.
---
New meta approaching
---
Yeah, same.
---
Outlaw desperado
---
If I remember correctly Ikora had the exotic. She does for Shadowkeep
---
Everyone, it's a glitch to they you to 900, NOT 950. The grind to 950 is going to be hella long.
---
Spawn in on the moon
---
Go to the right or Eris.
---
Next area with adds has a sword bearer 
---
Kill him
---
Jumping ouzxle with platforms appear to a chest
---
Rinse and repeat
---
The season pass has its own XP so just play the game and you will eventually rank up. Do strikes, the campaign if you haven‚Äôt finished it, PvP, exotic quests, etc
---
Go talk to Holliday on the right side of the map in the tower. She gives you the starting quests for the red war, curse of osiris and warmind if you want to play through the legacy content.
---
Wow I was meaning is there a more effective way to levelling up not a exploit as such but a way to gain a wealthy amount of xp
---
over whaa?
---
I saw that the game opens with the opening mission from the first Destiny now. How much of Destiny 1 is in Destiny 2 now?
---
Pretty sure [these](https://youtu.be/NZOFukA2V0A) were my exact words when I turned the corner and saw it.
---
Try not being mean
---
If I remember it right, Fikrul, Uldren and the Barons were all bound together in Riven's wish magic. So he and his Barons and the Scorn were his attack dogs, though they were already criminals in their own rights that had to be put away.
---
I feel like this would be a valid point if fortnite players didn‚Äôt do the same thing back and even different consoles that are almost identical do the same thing people just want to say what they have is better when in reality it is all just a perspective thing
---
The sparrow dash is by double tapping in the direction. Not sure if there's an exclusive keybind for it,but that's how I do it.
---
Yeah, I don't know. Can you restart the game and clear it up?
---
My mistake.. cause I bought shadowkeep and Forsaken came with it so I imagined it would be free with everything else from the past Destiny 2 expansions
---
*Kamehameha
---
Yeah probably but i think you feel no accoplishment at all by gaining light, unlocking stuff, new missions, new planets, new mods.... 
---
Everything is here and that's it.
---
Up to the soft cap of 900.
---
Your bravery is admirable
---
Well, based on the post, at least 95k people.
---
Well... ur not completely wrong.
---
Same problem here. Did you figure it out?
---
You mean 1 chrome tab?
---
I've been exposed
---
Yeah i made a mistake its 900 and not 950. Doesn't go past softcap
---
It‚Äôs literally in the beginning. It‚Äôs the reason the guide exists. People in here are asking questions for the exact purpose the guide exists.
---
Yes, but not to human ears:
---
&gt; Divers have reported blue whale vocalizations as being "felt" more than heard. Blue whales make very deep low-pitched sounds that have been recorded as high as 188 decibels (at 1m from the sound source) - far and away the loudest sound made by any animal. A passenger jet at take off makes a noise that is 120 decibels. Blue whales sound can be heard at a distance of over 500 miles (800 kilometres) - as long as you can hear that frequency (i.e. if you're another blue whale).

I hope so.  :)

Near eris in he moon it's a terminal next to a hole and there's a drop off with 6 craters I think

I'm a new player and I'm of two minds about it. On one hand, this seems like a big game with lots to do and it'd have been nice to be eased in a little better. I didn't know until this thread that there's an NPC you talk to play the campaign, for instance. 
---
On the other hand, it seems like a lot of this game's best content is in what you'd consider "post-game", and I'm taking endless comfort in the idea that I don't need to grind for hours to get a taste of it. As someone that was always deterred by tales of how grind-y Destiny is, it's nice to feel like grinding isn't the price of admission.
---
You aren‚Äôt entitled to commenting on ppls post that are asking questions and giving negative feedback. You just mad Bc you ain‚Äôt got friends that will go in half on stuff with you

You can dislike fortnite, its just a problem when people circle jerk a game and karma farm situations like these.
---
Story of my life
---
Yes it‚Äôs like the cats in the dreaming city.
---
Prolly cuz they cost money lamayo and shadow keep is lame with hardly any vendor refresh and the pvp scout is ass, as well as the quest requiring you to use scouts in comp. RIP bungie and destiny
---
I'm just complety lost as to how a new player is supposed to kbow what to do
---
Weapons are all transferable. Armor is not.
---
That‚Äôs it. You can‚Äôt get any more triumphs. Enjoy the constant flashing when you hover over them, unable to claim them.
---
How many of these posts are we gonna get
---
It's a bug across all platforms, don't know of a fix yet.
---
I have a Hunter like that, going to wait for a patch, but tbh I was thinking of deleting him to try the new character missions.
---
Actually she played and loved d1. Stopped playing d2 a few months after d2 launch. But she is starting again with shadow keep sooo cheers see you on the battlefield guardian.
---
Ohhh
---
One of my clanmates got this last night. It was very nice.
---
Black armory:
---
Forge your own weapon. New fallen raid.
---
Season of the drifter:
---
Fairly self explanatory. New gambit mode. The nine are also up to something.
---
Season of Opulence:
---
Calus gives us loot. Introduces the Menagerie, a 6 player match made PvE puzzle activity. Tribute hall/hologram shooting range. New hive/leviathan raid.
---
Shadowkeep and Season of the undying:
---
Moon‚Äôs haunted. Armor has been reworked, everything looks hella spicy now.
---
The D4 ships are ingame now?
---
You have seen him but smol
---
It's under quests
---
Rice cake thing
---
You rolled a 1...  Badlands for you!
---
but in all seriousness the only legendary weapons that drop for me are badlands so I‚Äôm just hoping you guys have better luck.
---
Thank you for this!
---
827
---
Can someone explain why theres no trophies for this expansion? Even though forsaken had a trophy lost.
---
It's only by 5 thousand and it litteraly just went free to play you dumb fuck
---
more like fernando amaright?
---
paladins player here
---
Cowabunga *indeed*
---
Sounds like fun, and possibly not too difficult! Guess its a good idea to stay away from The Crucible though as I'll be dangerously underpowered. In your opinion, what a good way to Warlock?
---
It is
---
This is me but with 2 hours of traffic and leaving at 7pm :(
---
Wrong forsaken isn't free the forsaken annual pass became free for forsaken owners but u still have to buy forsaken
---
Never. Stay. Still.
---
How'd you get the PS4 controller to work with Steam Link? I tried earlier this morning and couldn't get it to work.
---
You can do it with tokens.  I went from 808 to 840+ in about 30 minutes of running between Banchee, Shaxx, and Zavala. I'm going to just stay in the tower till I'm 900 then I'll continue the campaign cause I'm worried I will complete powerful rewards before the soft cap.
---
Honestly I'm hoping for an avengers infinity war type of ending when season 10 comes out. That would be a great ending for D2 and intro to D3.
---
Follow
---
Get the warmind campaign quest from Amanda Holliday in the tower
---
I've tried holding square with jade rabbit and two tailed fox neither worked
---
This is a pc game too.
---
As someone who works on an IT Server team, I really appreciate this haha
---
Same here. Trying to figure this out...
---
Experience
---
Most of us do. Doesn't help. Going to the gym is hard.
---
Behold! 6 man drop kick of doom!
---
Oh, I think I was mistaken. This is for the Vanguard mission I think. "A Loud Racket" is the mission and I got it from Zavala.
---
Armor piercing I believe
---
There's several of em to find, i Found one at the end of a lost sector, but have yet to find one of those rice cakes though.
---
Go at Tower and talk to different npcs, you probably missed something there.
---
Holy shit yes
---
Am I missing something here that I‚Äôm not getting? Lol
---
I only started playing during Forsaken. I'm guessing that the ornament is permanently unavailable to me?
---
so confused
---
They better keep that cannon!
---
I'm only going by what I've found so far while playing.  It looks like ammo finders are tied to your helmet now and I've only found ones that are specific to a weapon like I have a bow, hand cannon and machine gun. They are also locked to an element. I have not seen any generic finders like special and heavy yet.
---
I was so scared when I got pulled into it. Especially when my ghost got possessed.
---
That I do not know
---
Lol welcome to my world
---
Menagerie used to give infinite amounts of loot, by only 2-3 powerful drops. Now that it‚Äôs all non powerful you can just go crazy.
---
At the tower, talk to an NPC named Amanda Holliday. She gives you the three campaign missions. After collecting them, you can start them from the map menu by clicking their respective icons. As you complete missions, the icons will move to different planets/locations depending on where that mission will occur.
---
yes as in if you want to queue in and not play against fireteams of people then you can use that playlist
---
Side note: As satisfying as the *actual* ending was, I would have liked to see Scarlet Witch tear Thanos limb from limb without him even knowing why.
---
thanks!
---
[removed]
---
So I can get it by doing it an infinite amount of times?
---
Maybe Taken Raisins this year!
---
Most likely because there are still paid versions of the game (Forsaken, Shadowkeep, and the next 4 seasons) that cross play with the F2P model in PVP and old content. But most likely a Sony thing. Make the switch to PC.
---
960, but with the artifact, you essentially have unlimited power. So, for example, you could get to 1k power by the end of the season
---
in your display adapter make sure your PC is running the monitor at its highest refresh rate, also turn off VSYNC you might turn off FreeSync as well you V56 should be running it fine
---
No. We just like dry humping air while shooting a immune giant blob in the sky.
---
Find Amanda Holiday in the Tower. She can give you the old campaigns. Baffling decision to make it this obtuse to do, but there you go.
---
It‚Äôs been stated multiple times that it‚Äôs just eververse stuff that‚Äôll be used as ornaments.
---
I understand your frustrations, but all the things you are complaining about bungie literally said would happen. So please do as others have said and take your crying somewhere else.
---
Probably too soon to judge it fairly being that it just came out yesterday. But, as a fellow on and off Destiny 1/2 player, I‚Äôm enjoying it so far. There‚Äôs a good amount of changes to the armor system. The finishers are a cool addition, but you‚Äôre not forced into them if you don‚Äôt like them. The story is meh, but I‚Äôve never really been into Destiny for the story. Overall, after a day of playing, would I say it‚Äôs worth the $40? If you like Destiny, then yep, it‚Äôs more of that. And the way I look at it is I know I‚Äôm gonna get at least probably 100+ hours of fun out of it I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs absolutely worth the money.
---
Yeah that whole thing was geared mostly towards older players but I‚Äôm sure once you start playing the game you‚Äôll get the chance to do it somehow
---
They haven‚Äôt before, unless someone argues that DLC is pay to win because I‚Äôve seen that argument so often
---
Tire
---
‚ÄúI have an injector for...‚Äù is all I had to see. You might‚Äôve just screwed yourself by using cheating software. I‚Äôm sure it just found it‚Äôs files in the directories it could read and flagged you as using it even if it wasn‚Äôt. Now it‚Äôs up to you to contact Bungie support and pray. Otherwise you‚Äôd have to make a new Steam and Bungie login.
---
If you didn‚Äôt complete it before shadow keep it reset so you‚Äôll have to restart
---
I stopped playing this a while back, but I grided with my warlock and got a ton of higher tier gear. 
---
It pisses me off immensely that I come back to it, to see what the f2p is about, and I am getting common gear that is, by default, better than the gear I grinded my ass off to get.
---
And, for my boyfriend, he has not played it much before. Made a new character, but the story of D2 is hidden away (we had to look up how to activate the main story quests) and the tutorial isn't teaching anything. It won't tell you what buttons to press to activate things. He had to go into his control settings to learn how to even activate his powers.
---
Tbh it's not at all worth the f2p hype
---
So how it felt to do the darkblade part of the sword quest in D1
---
Grinding to "max" power is the next priority for most people, getting raid ready and prepping for other content for this season (like the vex offensive)
---
Wondering  the same thing. Only forsaken campaign is showing. But I also definitely beat it.
---
I got Olive three or four times. Had to reboot my destiny after waiting 30m to get in...
---
Same lol I'm still using a 1.0 set because its gonna take me forever to earn the enhanced mods I want to use on my gear
---
The girl with 3 eyes is Eris Morn, back in the first Game Destiny 1 She and a fireteam if others went into the Hellmouth (that big hole in the map) and everyone but her was killed after they lost their light, she only survived because of the bone she keeps in that little green ball of fire, the bone is from a kind of dragon that can grant wishes but it‚Äôs like a monkeys paw, every wish has a bad side, she wished to escape but in return the wish took away her light, ghost and eyes and she was forced to replace them with the eyes of an Acolyte, one of the smaller hive warriors, she is almost certainly on your side, but she deals in hive magic and as such, her attire looks quite villain like
---
Yeah that I didn‚Äôt really understand. I don‚Äôt mind if I need to restart, I just don‚Äôt understand the difference for a returning player vs. brand new
---
I was waiting for someone to say it. 
---
Or. That captain on Nessus. I can‚Äôt count the number of times I was in the location and a titan literally thunder crashed ACROSS THE MAP to kill him before I could get a shot on him. 
---
This game is awesome.
---
At least you get the option to read slow... Mines forced :(
---
Can you please share where is this NPC b'cos I have been looking for the main story quest but only doing some incursions and some side quest so it seems.
---
it's a complete mess. I have been trying to make sense of it now.
---
I just wanna keep the look of my current gear.. can I not do that? :(
---
The Red War was the story campaign when the game lauched, then came out Curse of Osiris and Warmind
---
I imagine this will be part of a megathread at raid secrets, I‚Äôd post it overthere
---
Each essence is a piece of gear, they work like bounties complete the task and take them to the lecturn, however you have to have the lecturn first which is unlock via story. I had 3 finished essences before i got the lecturn so keep doing story and youll get there.
---
Sadly no :/ I do understand though I‚Äôve had a few gear sets I liked but couldn‚Äôt keep em
---
oh cool, so my goal right now should be to get tons of loot and get my level up real high?
---
I'm kinda confused. Could someone tell me if as a F2P without Forsaken do I have access to black Armory and Reckoning?
---
I figured it out! 
---
You need a "Small rice cake"
---
I forgot where or why I got it but all it gave me was 9 Phantasmal Fragments so im not sure how worth it is
---
Ok so i can hold more than 1 essence quest?
---
https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/02/ps4-crossplay-can-now-support-title-says-sony-10845969/
---
Ah right okay then. I'm okay with that, but I can't even find where to go to start it again. It's as if it think I've completed it but I haven't seen it through to the end yet.
---
Someone said theyve had this happen for about a week so bungie probably knows about it
---
im snickering
---
Yes you do, you get access to all Annual Pass content, which that is/was apart of
---
You can have one of each type of essence in your inventory yes.
---
I choose Hunter as a class, I can't avoid saying "It's hiiIIIIIIIIGHHHH NOOOoooon" 
---
Love this game
---
Ok thanks for the help.
---
Rip. Is forsaken started the same way?
---
You can game share shadowkeep and pre order bonuses, but the season pass has to be bought separately.
---
Thorn looks great and Ace looks fine but nothing will ever replace the chicken ornament and when are we getting another Sunshot ornament Bungie!
---
If you want to play the campaign, go to Amanda and get the quests.
---
do you get the perks by dismantling other armor sets, or does it randomly roll a selection of a few perks to "build" your own perk tree?
---
I would say complete Shadowkeep as well if he can and get Assassins Cowl, the 50% health and invis costs no super energy unlike the mods and is absolutely great atm
---
Yeah, all non shadowkeep campaigns are now started from amanda.
---
I agree, it‚Äôs amazingly infuriating and I think bungie really fucked up here
---
You just have to do new light and then you can do red war and such
---
Gosh darn I could kiss you right now. Thanks.

---
Speaking of which a random thrall dropped me a god roll badlander (full choke, accurised rounds, range mw, slideshot and quickdraw) around 30 minuts after beginning shadowkeep, so thats nice
---
As in redownload the free game?
---
My favorite AoS ornimanate

Found it ? I was lost too after I saw the Eversum at the button that it says go to Amanda üòÇ

DAMN

---
Check with Amanda Holliday in the tower. She has the quests to start the older campaigns.
---
How does the armor stats work now? Is there a certain number of points spread out differently each time, or is the whole thing just random?
---
15 mil is the number of tracked players but not necessarily those that were active yesterday. Steam had just under a quarter mil total yesterday that were active. Unless Xbox and ps4 hit 14.5 mil yesterday for active users, I don't see it as a legit number to follow
---
I know I can still play the original story but are you saying that I can just opt out of new light and play the base game from power level 100? Because that would be great.
---
Flying Menace was very rare when I played frequently. So I mean Warlovk with the floaty jump you can aim and shoot with. Worked nicely with my favourite handcannon Better Devils and that other devil called Lion-something 2nd weapon slot grenade launcher! :D 
---
I enjoyed the playstyle so much. I was surprised to see not many people at least in crucible used it. Works great in pve too. 
---
I saw other floatybois here and there but it seemed like they hadn't really embraced the flying style of death. One wise man once said:
---
"Let go your earthly tether. Enter the void, empty and become wind... Empty and become wind."
---
Are you a noob ass bitch, or have you been playing this game? I want to know why they made that gun damaged.
---
You have to earn the perk "mods" through activites. The enhanced mods through more challenging activities etc
---
Amanda have the quests for the campaigns (first 3)
---
I will check this. Thank you.
---
Nope
---
You wasted 30 dollars because yesterday Destiny 2 went F2P and it became Destiny 2 New Light, which includes the first two dlcs thst came out.
---
Shadowkeep is the dlc that also launched yesterday. 
---
And about how to play from whenever you were, I can't tell you because your progress should've kept the same even though D2 became New Light
---
Lucky you that you were able to end the tutorial...
---
Ok then don't. Pretty simple
---
Is the story worth doing? I started this afternoon and am climbing light and really just wanna get into the exotic grind tbh
---
I shouldn‚Äôt expect it though that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying.  I don‚Äôt want to have to grind a playlist where anything I do doesn‚Äôt matter, I get randomly one hit or weakened to one shot by mtp.  Also I do have last word, I had it a few hours after it released.  But I don‚Äôt want to play like that because nobody respects it.  Not to mention you can‚Äôt use it in pickups or scrims so what‚Äôs the point of maiming it.  Thanks though, I‚Äôm just really frustrated over the stark contrast between comp and scrims.  I had hoped they‚Äôd be closer to each other.
---
Spicy rock on a stick
---
I agree with you 100%. I'm not sure where everyone gets this 15 or 20 mil. I could believe 1 or even 1.5 mil which would be a big maybe. Destiny did break the record and beat warframe for most active players in an online steam game. I think it was 215k but nowhere near what I've seen from comments
---
What‚Äôs the best way to level up in this game and should I join a clan/squad?
---
Wheres it located?
---
You rite
---
When did they ever say solstice was gonna be an ornament? All Bungie ever said was you'd get a 2.0 set...
---
I think it‚Äôs reduced frequency but the whole team can pick up a brick. I also only get one rocket now too
---
Amanda Holiday only has The Red War, Curse of Osiris and Warmind üòî no Forsaken. Great shout but still a confusing one.
---
I think it is a rotating playlist. You can get all the frames in any forge, but they change at daily reset.
---
Tangled shore.Amanda just has red war Osiris and warming
---
You'll love this one then I'm sure.
---
Yeah righty oh mate, cheers for that info, I've been off it for a month now till the other morning for launch
---
Play the story and only infuse into gear you think has good rolls. You won't need a clan but they do give rewards for being in one. Until you're 900 power you can play whatever you want
---
so stupid question to follow upm, how do i start forsaken?
---
It depends on who you bought it through. Essentially if you have your receipt and you have not received everything you paid for, contact the seller through whatever support system they have and explain the problem. If it‚Äôs not listed in your receipt, Google is your friend.
---
But if you just messed up bought the wrong thing, you‚Äôre probably out of luck.
---
Yeah I didn't expect it so I was laughing my ass off when it happened
---
As I stated. On their live tracker yesterday for total logins and queue. I even have a picture my brother sent from the next room in a queue and his place was in the high 9 mil. I know that's not 15 plus, that's just where he was in line.
---
Ohh thats what the are for. Thank you!
---
I‚Äôll see what I can do
---
Using him as we speak! At 886 right now.
---
The writing for all of that has always been really inconsistent.
---
This deserves more ‚¨ÜÔ∏è than it got.
---
i like how we cant pull armor 2.0 from collection.
---
When you hover over your light it should show it. But it only lasts the first 5 levels of your pass each week. After that it goes away until the next week. (I'm assuming that this was the "large XP booster")
---
Trust me I understand your frustration. I just feel like with the patch notes and everything getting fixed around that it should be something more noticeable. The fact that exotics and pinnacles in the first place are allowed invites the very meta to use them so being upset about that when it probably won't get taken out just seems wasting. But like I said I understand your frustration. I also don't want to seem offending in anyway through this post.
---
Will this allow me to play through the whole story as if i had started on day 1? cause that is what i am interested in doing with my wife and i.
---
Do not do that. You will fuck your quest. I‚Äôve done this to twice not to 2 characters. I screwed myself. Don‚Äôt do this, this guy is referring to the quest prior to shadow keep.
---
Hfvsh liueh jdggagua zhzhzhzhzhz
---
Indeed
---
It is just a random forge drop when completing a powerful weapon frame.
---
I know you‚Äôre getting downvoted here, but I definitely agree with you. I played a ton of Destiny 1 but just got around to trying 2 last night. I was kind of disappointed when I just had everything and it made playing through the original campaign basically pointless
---
I think you go to see Amanda holiday to do the forsaken stuff?
---
New player here. So what exactly one should do when they start off? Progress campaign? Do strikes/bounties (did my first one a second ago) or focus on something else?
---
Me throughout the last 2 years of Destiny 2.
---
Destiny just had a DLC drop, what do you expect?
---
Nice, that's was my year 1 armor set, except with the crucible shader &amp; Helm of Saint-14.
---
I purchased it on PS4 (and the same would happen if you purchased it on steam and were transferring from PS4.) Shadowkeep would be available yes, but the season pass is a silver purchased item, meaning it's not applicable to any other account. Due to the cross above system not transferring your account, despite the website saying it did, you would log in instead to a character creation screen since you're new to playstation/steam, linking it to that account and not your transferred guardian from steam/playstation.

---
Returning player here, maybe someone can help me out a botm
---
I played through Forsaken but never got too much into endgame there. The idea of having a weekly cap of activities to get better gear was unappealing to me. I disliked PvP and that left me with a handful of activities I finished off in 1-2 days only to wait another week.
---
Is shadowkeep the same?
---
Additionally, since I left after forsaken, what else besides Shadowkeep is there for me? I do not want to immediately drop money. I already spent so much on a game that did not really stuck with me. But when I logged in today there was so much stuff I have no idea where to start. I have 2 pages of quests for example and accepted even more in the tower...
---
And then used the time stone to rewind and do it again?
---
And some older awoken ships have nuclear payloads on board so if we just dealt with the reef and grabbed some nuke then just nuke the fuck out of the surface
---
its not there. in the same boat. trying to finish forsaken before i get shadow and i have no idea how to finish it now.
---
SOLVED
---
I was an idiot.
---
Thanks for all the help. It's right at the bottom on Tangled Shore. And correct, I have to start again.
---
By off I hope you mean amazing, I used thorn before shadowkeep and slayed, with the new animation I'm shitting on people even harder
---
It threw in the Season of Undying battle pass as an incentive to purchase. And if you didnt buy shadowkeep, it would be available as the silver purchase instead.
---
How do you get ace ornament I really want it!
---
Well give us any credit, the bot is probably using a Gallahorn look-a-like
---
I‚Äôm extremely proud right now
---
A+ gamer parenting.
---
Reminds me of godzilla
---
Preloading was a thing with very slow internet. Most of the time, if your internet speed allows it, it's faster to download via steam than preloading and unpacking. 
---
The download after release will be unpacked immediately.
---
I still miss my Y1 D1 hawkmoon
---
Yeah think it's only one step
---
The heroic daily, basically replay a mission on higher power for the weekly powerful bounty
---
Yes. It's labeled as "Legacy content".
---
I'm also a new player so I wouldn't know if it's exactly like day 1, but without spoiling anything the story so far gives me the impression that it is.
---
problem is that they got introduced to games as things to win and beat other people at. not, narrative experiences on par or better than reading books/watching movies.
---
I think it's the same for every "old" campaign. Go to Amanda in the hangar in the tower and she will give it to you.
---
