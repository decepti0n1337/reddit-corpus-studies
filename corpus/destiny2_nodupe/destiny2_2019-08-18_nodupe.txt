Oh, no doubt. I'm just speaking about easy to access. I've not met anyone, no clan, and I'm not seeing any matchmaking for anything beyond strikes. I don't raid like I used to, but seems most of the content requires putting together your own groups with people you know there unless I've missed something.

---
Disrespecting people is what's spineless my man
---
Y‚Äôall heard the noise when you reverse with the SP Junior?
---
Updoot incoming!!!
---
You have to unlock each of the forges in order. Sorry to bring bad news :/
---
Vex encryption? Unbreakable... so they say.
---
You can have people leave at any point, it only fails if someone dies
---
Not really cuz if ur overshield breaks just step back in the bubble
---
r/wooooshwith4os
---
Even Fenchurch doesn't know her name.
---
Oh man üò¢ does it take long to unlock them by any chance? How do you unlock the second one too? I just unlocked the first one just now. Thanks!
---
If you combine all 50 of this week‚Äôs edge transit drops, you get the new exotic: Edge Transita
---
r/whooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSHHHHHH69HHHHHHHHH
---
Sent you a message with an 8K version, go nuts :)
---
W- why do you dare raise him a titan...
---
r/twentycharacterlimit
---
I have too much glimmer all the time what do you need it for? Upgrading and infusing weapons right
---
Menagerie and Reckoning, and Black Armory Forges are matchmade, and if you do the invitation to the menagerie questline you‚Äôll get a set of 690 gear to immediately jump into full endgame content. Also what platform are you on?
---
Also think that a hunter should be able to outrun a Titan in super Saiyan (Fist of havoc)
---
Because through and through he‚Äôs a titan. He plays all 3. But that boy can walk out o any gun fight unscathed and it will always baffle me
---
You gotta submit the code
---
Don‚Äôt listen to that. You don‚Äôt need a range masterwork on snipers (especially PvP) because much much more than enough.  
---
The roll you have has two of the 4 best perks available, no distractions is good if you can watch a corner for a few seconds. Pretty good!
---
How are stompees a problem?
---
You can't reset glory.
---
And buying bounties, things from Spider, stuff from collections if you need a weapon to finish a quest, etc.
---
[Me too.](https://i.imgur.com/7AKefYR.png) Hoping they don't change the amount before I end up needing to dismantle these.
---
Pretty much how I'm gonna feel after I'm done with destiny campaigns XD
---
Have you ever gone up against a semi-decent stompees hunter? Ever?
---
But they still have 2 OG exotic hand cannons left hawkmoon and first curse
---
Have you installed all of the current updates?
---
[deleted]
---
Found the gay guy
---
Yes
---
I'm at heroic 3 (mostly becuase I don't play pvp often) but I still understand this stuff. Do have to say though maybe supers should be toned down to where you can one shot them in the head with a higher impact sniper. And maybe bottom tree striker's speed could be toned down to where higher agility guardians can outrun it (*cough *cough Hunters). And the length could be toned down.
---
Then I have no clue why mine is so big. If you have all the updates installed and it only takes up 120 then it doesn‚Äôt make sense that this update is so dam big
---
I re bought the game as the legendary collection so I have it on digital download however before I had it on disc. And i found that the disc version of the game took up and extra 30 or so GB. I think this is because of the systems that were in place and then removed with forsaken
---
I don't have Forsaken Unfortunately. I am planning to buy it though. Is it that worth it?
---
I love hawkmoon and hated the first curse, was a horrible grind and wasn't worth
---
Does Khajiit take Strange Coin?
---
Yes, once armor 2.0 is live in shadowkeep you can
---
The only way is liars handshake
---
I got mine a year ago at EB Games too. They adorn my Destiny shelf well. I love them very much.
---
I fucking love Liars Handshake
---
Monte Carlo is coming, maybe it's a quest exotic?
---
Hm, that sounds like the result you would get if having a very high ping (the matchmaking engine won't match ppl with a huge difference in ping).
---

---
Are you having this issue in other modes, such as strikes or reckoning?
---
Would be cool to learn a bit about it though a quest
---
They're happy because you can't do shit.
---
Haven't tested that out myself. Will try it out, although sounds like a lot of work for a farm..
---
Pretty sure recluse will always be viable no matter which dlc drops
---
Yes but that was also hundreds of years ago. Which you were dead for so you kinda served your sentence??
---
somebody's salty
---
I mean you could still farm at 750 normally. You‚Äôd just be kind of dick just sitting there but hey you‚Äôre basically printing your own money so
---
What kind of lines is it? Cuz he just calls me ‚Äúsister‚Äù like he always has.
---
this might be some bigger news to you, we had a Hunter Vanguard once, his name: Cayde 6, a fabled hunter of many lives, until he spoke his last words on that horrid day, Cayde was gruesomely murdered, we found his killer and gave him a familiar reminder that life is as fraile as his feeble plans.
---
Same here, 4 in 2 weeks.  2 shinobus vow and 2 colonies. 
---
I honest to god wasn‚Äôt sure what the first one was because it dropped on the other side of the room and I *ALMOST* left it.
---
Still havnt chosen, pressing Esc when talking to the drifter is muscle memory at this point.
---
There's no audio
---
Not at chance, I can easily solo the first phase of any forge, ppl playing legit will be able to extend the timer at least to the point pf kicking you out by inactivity
---
Oml seriously?
---
I think that's how many multi kills you got
---
Yeah it‚Äôs fucking ridiculous how strong supers are, although I‚Äôve learnt how to avoid or make them kill themselves/waste the super only on me and not let them have 8 kills from 1 super, but it‚Äôs still broken af, there‚Äôs really no counterplay. But you‚Äôre close brother, just keep grinding that comp
---
The thorn is pretty much hive magic tho
---
I‚Äôd like one ~~alcohol~~ engram please.
---
What about septims?
---
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TEACH YOU THIS LESSON OLD MAN!?!?!
---
#THE BEST CRYPTARCHS ARE NEVER KNOWN BY NAME
---
Probably just changes if you side against him, just calls us snitch all the time
---
Almost had me. Photoshop skills are on point.
---
You have to get 7 kills within a specific amount of time, like 5 seconds or something
---
A lot of people actually
---
Player *Your sanity* has left the game
---
that¬¥s the ammount of multikills you had. you could have a 7th column and if that was your only multikill it would show a 1
---
Chill with the meme spam
---
Can u specify what sk means? I‚Äôm a bit late returning to destiny and may not know most new things.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
How do you choose an alliegence
---
More keybinds/more specific keybinds which could potentially make you quicker if they were mastered and also mouse, this makes recoil control potentially easier depending on the person but all in all, if your PC is a high quality PC then you get higher quality at better framerates. That was my main reason to switching for all gaming as a whole.
---
The way you worded it originally made it seem like those that dont live and breath destiny dont belong. I do agree that one should at least attempt the pinnacle activities. Since I retired I've spend more time than ever on destiny, and believe me I don't feel entitled to anything. Took me 2 years to get around to actually completing leviathan. Knowing mynakill ability and arthritic thumbs, I doubt iffn I'll ever inflict myself on a team running last wish or cos.
---
I know there are more folks like me out there, who dont live on reddit of tweet, of the same abilities and skill. I've seen too many folks here blast anyone who does eat, breath,dream destiny2.
---
Ignorenor treat is like like crap and over 1/2 the player base goes else where. If the player base dropped 80 or 90 %, where the game still be online?
---
Theres a reason something called "aim assist" exists for FPS titles on consoles. Mouse and keyboard is far more precise. Its the difference between a scalpel and a butter knife
---
All right, thanks for the reply guys!
---
I thought it was a flower the first time I saw the headshot.
---
Tbh scorpion vsr is really nice at longer ranges. Especially on that nine themed map.
---
Basically anywhere tbh. With the enemy up chances are gonna be pretty high that you‚Äôll always have a couple people doing them and turning them heroic. That being said, def wherever the flashpoint is,
---
&gt;As long as you obtained the majestic (legendary/purple) set, yes you'll get a 2.0 set on Oct 1st.
---
Can I get a masterworked 2.0 set if I've achieved my masterwork and haven't done it?
---
They don‚Äôt stack..
---
You can get another set if you want. Open a bunch of solstice packages.
---
You down voted me saying I wanted celestial and lunafaction to exist? That's petty.
---
The boss will count
---
Well I guess that‚Äôs why we know yours, Rahool.
---
^bitch
---
Great, thanks! Now just do find a group later looking for one more at the final boss.
---
Not sure I understand what you are saying... 
---
You have to be wearing the armor piece when you complete the requirement to masterwork it. The only retroactive one I know of is the Valor reset.
---
PC or console?
---
F
---
Hot damn I swear I watched that like 10 times before I noticed what actually happened
---
I miss the no land beyond
---
I wish Bungie would try and stop them from being on there
---
I assume so or there wouldn't be so many ads. There are people that fall for the Nigerian prince scam, so I'm not surprised people are dumb enough to hand over their personal data.
---
Me too.  I'm just trying to find people looking to do strikes or whatever and this shit annoys me.
---
There‚Äôs a quest in your pursuits, a flaming gambit coin I think, follow that. Starts with completing a gambit prime bounty (If I recall correctly) and then going back and talking to Drifter and plays out from there.
---
You could still do it with a fireteam, so probably just lfg it and hash out how long everyone is trying to go afk for.
---
When I was looking for help in comp, got 15 messages asking me to pay them
---
Hay 
---
I have never used the one eyed mask ever 
---
And I have never used shotguns in pvp
---
And they are all solar I see a pattern
---
Oh nice. Yes yes I remember that one. Okay I‚Äôll check it out. Thanks buddy
---
Catcher O‚Äô Weep
---
The damage doesn't stack, yes, but rest should work the same way it does now. So you place a bubble and a well. The bubble is for the damage buff, the Well for healing and auto reload.
---
Nah I don‚Äôt.
---
Will do
---
Hello, would you like to yalk about our lord and savior Argos?
---
I recommend foresaken at least for the story tbh skipping all that dlc and going to shadow keep just seems.... Wrong?
---
As long as I don‚Äôt look like I rolled out of a box under I-95 next season like I did for most of Forsaken then I‚Äôm happy. Tired of looking like a hobo. I‚Äôll be wearing my Majestic Solstice set until I find something more dashing.
---
Nilfheim frost? I've been trying to get it for wayfarer but all I've gotten is 18 kelvins
---
#ONLY BY THE QUALITY OF THEIR WORK
---
That's me with the Foregone Conclusion AR, that RPM just feels so... *nice.*
---
No the one that‚Äôs a legendary version of (I think) Polaris lance. I think it‚Äôs called braytech MK.IV or something similar
---
Did not know this, time to make collection badges gold now that I've completed the solstice grind. Thank you.
---
And honestly sound is a big thing for me too. If a gun sounds stupid to shoot it‚Äôs going to feel stupid to shoot
---
It‚Äôs weird because the store actually prevents you from buying it at that price as well, so you can‚Äôt just go Koch Bros on it either.
---
I love it as a Titan main. Titan gang rise up!
---
There was a way to put a masterwork kill counter on forsaken exotics during forsaken.
---
This happens a lot, people pay to get pulled through comp to get the weps...
---
There are tons of adds advertising this on the LFG apps and sites
---
Basically the reason I refuse to use most Legendary Handcannons, I really dislike that high pitched muzzle sound they make. TLW on the other hand.. oh baby!
---
I currently keep both those sets in my equipment. I recently reacquired them when the Opulent versions of Mida Minitool and Drang came out. It‚Äôs even better now than I remember it.
---
I have a Transfiguration with Ambitious Assassin and Rampage I found in my vault today.  Really fun so far.
---
I didn't know what it was up until a few days ago.....now I hate it.
---
Slide to the right.
---
That might've been the first time I've seen someone use the chat lol
---
I laughed, but I shouldn't.  I have fist of havoc'd off of so many maps.
---
Fixed Odds with tap the trigger and range is superb
---
Ah is that only PVE or both?
---
So just get a primary kill and then kill anyone else around you in the next five seconds?
---
They are. Everything that isn't 750 will be bumped to 750 at the launch of new light including things in the vault and on your person. It's the new power 'floor'
---
‚ÄòFREE‚Äô........ just send money. What the actual fuck?
---
The helmets look like gushers
---
It's really good in both
---
So does that make me a hyena?
---
200??? It‚Äôs only 25 these days on fleabay
---
Is Destiny going full Fortnite with this?
---
By the time the game was on pc people had figured out better weapons but the recoil being easier to control on all weapons probably didn't help its play rate either
---
Thats awesome.. try do it again haha
---
I don't want to get in a pc vs console war for no reason right now so I'm just gonna ask. Which one are you trying to say is better? Your phrasing + me being extremely tired is seriously confusing me
---
Loaded question is a fantastic weapon. You should go for it. It also only counts for one character, so make sure you do it on your main.
---
It deals great damage and chain kills mobs. Make sure to stove it after each shot so it refills the mag and gives you another load of explosives. People try to use it as fusion rifle which is wrong. And since the last fusion rifle buff it's a weapon i always keep in my inventory.
---
So now a titan on one class has a dps ability a shield ability, a way to reload weapons and a one hit melee... All without an exotic
---
And the ability to choose to use the super offensively as well as defensively
---
Seems fair
---
I believe he‚Äôs saying pc &gt; console. I have played on both and I agree with his statement.
---
Honestly i play it more than i did in D1.
---
It's the ugly maps that i dislike.
---
Not sure if this was patched but my team and I figured out that if you do 2 regular attacks and during the second one you spam the heavy attack the game will bug out and instantly destroy the knight and oger shields.
---
Everyone I know bought it with bright dust. However the armor glow is a *very* different story
---
Its not in pvp
---
You're not using it for the buff, it's to negate damage and allows teammates to safely damage shielded enemies
---
Who else is ready for trials of *ding ding ding ding* and all the commentary is the drifter saying ding
---
I hate you üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
It‚Äôs pretty bad compared to other weapons like recluse
---
Sounds like something you'd hear on Tumblr post-purge
---
Others in PvP seem to manage it ok even at long range (I'm on console)
---
Its in a different slot to recluse and is extremely effective on something like a stompee hunter
---
?????????????????????????
---
Nova bombs weakness is it has no strengths nice art
---
This is that blue Veist shader right? I always feel lots of blue shaders are underappreciated. Nice look! :)
---
It's been 84 years....
---
You should post this over on r/Destinyfashion
---
Always thought of this as one of the ugliest HC in D2
---
&gt;not made of tissue paper
---
Yeah mines a beach ball made of thin plastic. Take that bullets
---
Yh
---
Thanks
---
He is just a bit more tough than these yellow bar Servitors in Exodus Black.
---
Probably people afking the solstice armor games. I've seen a few but not many so you probably just haven't found any in your games
---
It's not under warranty unfortunately. But I did not open a laptop before. But you can't get experience if you won't make practice, eh ? :)
---
Say what you want about Erentil but OEM is a shitty thing to use
---
It‚Äôs decent if you have a reload perk otherwise it feels like eternity +1 for a reload to go through.
---
nope on pc, battle net let's you switch regions so i play eu when im solo and switch to america when my clan is online.
---
From my experience there are also less extreme laggy players or blatant hackers on america as well compared to eu
---
Crucible, strikes, nightfall, flashpoint, story missions should all count.
---
So you say you want to kill Zavala.
---
Indeed.
---
Even though this is 1 month old, Bungie has updated their [Account Restriction and banning policies](https://www.bungie.net/7_Destiny-Account-Restrictions-and-Banning-Policies/en/Help/Article/11929) on August 9th.  
---
&gt; Bungie regards some behavior to be in breach of the [license agreement](https://www.bungie.net/en/View/bungie/sla) that governs Destiny, and therefore potentially subject to access restrictions or bans. This behavior includes, but is not limited to:   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;...   
---
&gt;Using an external program or device to automate gameplay or circumvent idle detection.  
---
&gt;...  
---
&gt; Habitual quitting or idle behavior in matchmade activities
---
Be careful now.

Well you are a titan~~strikethrough~~ happens to the best of us

If not, what are we fighting for?

 *"A new hand touches the Beacon. Listen. Hear me and obey. A foul  darkness has seeped into my temple. A darkness that you will destroy.  Return my Beacon to Mount Kilkreath. And I will make you the instrument  of my cleansing light."*
---
~~well you are a titan~~ happens to the best of us
---
Thats true ^^ try to find a service manual for it, usually there is a point to point guide in them. Good luck!
---
I‚Äôve noticed this also. It seems almost anywhere at random. Even when I reduce the video settings, I still encounter. Updated all drivers I could find, and even reduced the priority on some Windows services that where using GPU. 
---
Dunno man :/
---
Honestly if I see a titan drifting around the corner with any sub class scares me.
---
I've been playing it for the last few days. I want to raid but I don't know any of the mechanics or have good enough guns I don't think.
---
Anything I should know is needed? I have Gjallarhorn.
---
People in 2019 really can't get what annual/season pass means?
---
You speak truth! I‚Äôve been hanging onto my small bore, accurized rounds, snapshot, explosive rounds for the inevitable buff. It‚Äôs super fun in PVE and already a solid contender in PVP but, if they buff scouts....... damn. Such a good scout with almost any roll to be honest.
---
Funny story. He never uses it. Had it before me. He actually very much dislikes it. He‚Äôs a very unique titan.
---
I haven't played in awhile but matches always seemed to be very one sided, either we dominated or the opposite team dominated, without any matches with an even middle ground.
---
He would probably rather just save you. He‚Äôs all a out being a protector. lol
---
No problem the deluxe comes with the new season pass
---
But you can already play on other platforms on the 20th. If you play on console and want to switch to pc you can play at Battle net until they change to steam.
---
You literally could've just looked this up on google
---
The only thing I remember about Y1 was a shit ton of team shooting
---
It will not be free. You can find your specific prices on any storefront. There are two editions - standard and special - the standard will be 30 USD, and include only Shadowkeep. The special will be 60 USD and include shadowkeep, some side add ons I believe, and the annual pass, giving access to all dlc added next year.
---

Warlock in a titans body
---
This is a logical response to give, but you have to keep in mind that people are asking similar questions and they also don‚Äôt have forsaken, for one reason or another. I was by no means try to offend.
---
You can find people willing to carry, half the dudes on twitch do it, me and a couple buddies have helped some people get to fabled.
---
I did this once in competitive on the same exact map, but was coming from the direction they were killed in. Used the Wardcliff and took out the entire team, who were apparently just around the corner. The Wardcliff tracked them, and I had no idea since I only saw the one teammate and my radar reflected (seemingly) one enemy. The satisfaction just as tasty
---
Pretty much. Cayde would have called him Ace. Without a doubt. Should see this kid invade with last word üëÄ makes a grown man weep.
---
Wait. That‚Äôs illegal.
---
You fool, you fell victim one of the classic blunders! Oxygen is about to be the new meta in shadowkeep
---
I just got one with exploding head and rampage last night. Was rather happy.
---
I understand. But there are so many people that have responeded very bad to me for not owning a dlc. Not particulary destiny 2. That's why i wrote that. But anyways, i hope we are clear now.
---
I have been using my outlaw rampage nightwatch non stop, its actually extremely decent and probably getting a buff
---
Fun fact not only can you forge them there. It‚Äôs also the only forge that will drop them as Curated some times too! And curated forge weapons will come with Bergusian Night like the curated scourge of the past weapons :)
---
Just a little less than 2 months...and it will get better.
---
I dropped ophidian aspect and 1k from one chest. And would trade them both right now for astrocyte. Lol
---
Literally every other pulse in the game besides other 340s is better than redrix I am pretty sure, the gun is the definition of mediocrity
---
Thank you
---
wait a minute, I need to go check my vault if I still have mine or other accounts
---
Ghosts can resurrect the dead but they can't change your chromosomes.
---
.......Fuck, this is accurate. At least on the Hunter part.
---
I have no idea how they managed to write her so badly. She has one or two good lines and the rest of the time sounds like she's either half asleep or hung over
---
I currently have Destiny 2 on PS4, and I plan on playing on PC once cross-save is available.
---
I know that in the new expansion, there won't be any new exclusives for PS; and I haven't played the game since early 2019. I would like to know if there are any exclusives currently on PS, so I can work towards obtaining them on PS4.
---
DO NOT EVER TALK SHIT ABOUT TRICKSLEEVES AGAIN.
---
*BWANNNNG*
---
*Rocket engine noises*
---
I love how you whip around so quickly to watch your impending doom.
---
Them and their rock-shaking concentration-shattering machinery.
---
nice. i went from 273 to 2100 without losing a game. solo que ftw. 15 game streak and thats all she wrote. just need hand cannon kills.
---
If you use Recluse and revoker you can have the same loadout as every sweat on Crucible
---
No you‚Äôre weren‚Äôt. It wasn‚Äôt lined up, you would‚Äôve gotten the kill had it been lined up because your kill was first on the feed.
---
Engrams are dodecahedral in shape, but that is a mislabeled icosahedron. It has 20 triangles instead of 12 pentagons.

# EVACUATE

How will glory points work when solo ? Is there in depth break down or is that yet to be released ?
---
Dude I love my oxygen.

I‚Äôve had huge success with Blast Furnace, Le Lemonade, and Golden Gun.
---
Shader name?
---
"Let's make it happen" üëâ üòéüëâ
---
thats nice! i got my 2100 with friends, one day of playing, i was tired but well, it was the Day i got my recluse
---
They were all clustered in there. Arc Web has a pretty nutty reach as well. Wish I had the other side to see exactly what happened.
---
Just third, 3rd my guy.
---
u/ms_claymore
---
My spike/snapshot/rampage SotR is an absolute monster for dps! MW is handling, meh. Added a freehand grip as well.
---
I love my Dragonfly Cut and Run and I use it all the time, gonna be even more fun with a buff!
---
I had no idea people paid for stuff either until I joined reddit. Fucking wild.
---
First of all PvE is way less balanced than PvP imo. 
---
Also on a side note, I loved D2Y1 graviton-lance era pvp. The primary fights just felt so much more fun+satisfying. People say that supers and abilities were too restrictive but honestly I liked it like that.
---
The irony is that I'll have friends when New Light starts.
---
if you dont miss beloved is better
---
r/nobodyasked but thanks for the info
---
Lol, have the same rolls on mine but with a range masterwork! Nice!
---
That sounds right, but it's strange because it doesn't release on Steam until October 1, yet transfers start on August 20.  
---
Maybe the transfer on the 20th is just a "pre-registration" kind of thing.
---
Yeah as long as you get the legendary armour in time then you‚Äôve ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù solstice.
---
I've had that happen to me a lot using striker super.
---
Warming
---
*Warmind
---
I see I see. Thanks for the tips. We will try it soon again probably, so here's to hoping. We need like 8% more damage to not be wiped by her so hopefully.
---
Laughs in ballistic slam because that‚Äôs all I need
---
Respect to all titans who don't use OEM and BTS in crucible, you guys are representing your class well. Keep up the good work.
---
Regards, a friendly warlock.
---
duuufe same my friends are going to start playing once the game goes free.
---
Comp will be hilarious at the start of the season, since Shaxx will give them a quest to complete 2 comp matches.
---
What he said was in no way toxic. You were given an answer in your first post, yet you continue to spam this subreddit with the same question. 
---
Go take your ban up with bungie, nobody here can do a darn thing to help you. Don't post or comment about this issue again please.
---
that doesn't answer my question though, i dont have any of the expansions, i just have the sole base game and thats it, i want to know if the base game itself is being transfered or will i have to rebuy the GAME again
---
Raise the roof emote not found.jpeg
---
Probably one of the most broken loadouts ever made. Ace of Spades with Main Ingredient or a Badlander, OEM, and bottom tree striker titan. I'm sorry.
---
Shadowkeep doesn't release until October 1st. All the rest of the content is currently available.
---
Armamentarium and 5 ordnance mods = destruction
---
I use melee mods on my armor to get ballistic faster. Super energy from hitting with ballistic equals 1.5-2 orbs of light
---
Backup mag
---
What does it mean?
---
Middle tree striker with melee mods and a sidearm. There is no escaping death from above with a sidearm. Also getting my super within a few minutes with ballistic slam
---
How is it harder than shadow? Lol
---
What do we have? No friends!
---
The mad man doesn‚Äôt have sniper scavengers on
---
So, New Light is basically Destiny‚Äôs free-to-play version that launches on October 1st. Destiny 2, Curse of Osiris, and Warmind will all be completely free, along with all of the content that comes with them. New Light also has access to every planet, just not the activities associated with them. So New Light players will be able to go to the Moon in October, but they can‚Äôt play the dungeon on the Moon. New Light also has access to every strike, every Crucible map, and the Gambit and Gambit Prime game modes.
---
There‚Äôs a few options you have when it comes to DLC. Forsaken is the first, and it tells a sort of wild west revenge story that takes you through the Tangled Shore and Dreaming City. If you‚Äôre planning on getting it I‚Äôd HIGHLY recommend not reading anything about the story. Just know that everything about the Forsaken expansion was incredibly and is widely regarded as Destiny‚Äôs best content ever. Story is amazing and has some cool plot twists, but as a new character you might be confused by some of the characters and locations. I *think* Forsaken will come with its Annual Pass in New Light (but I‚Äôm not sure). If so, that‚Äôs access to even more fantastic new game modes, weapons, and raids. The Forge and Menagerie activities allow you to choose what gear you get, and the Reckoning is being rebalanced to be more forgiving with its loot. The Scourge of the Past raid, which is one of the 2 Annual Pass raids, is also my favorite raid of all time.
---
Shadowkeep is an upcoming major expansion to Destiny, launching on October 1st along with New Light. Shadowkeep is $35 for the standalone expansion. The story seems to be about an old ally who has been poking around on the Moon, and has accidentally awoken a new threat. Enemies from our past are being resurrected on the Moon‚Äôs surface. These are some major enemies too, like Crota who was a Hive god and Skolas who was a Fallen that nearly stole Vex technology and annihilated the Awoken. Shadowkeep is coming with a new raid, new story, and likely some new activities as well.
---
Shadowkeep will also have an Annual Pass, which you can buy separately or bundled with Shadowkeep. Annual Pass content is much smaller scale than big DLC‚Äôs like Shadowkeep, but provide a drip feed of content throughout the year so things don‚Äôt get stale. Forsaken‚Äôs Annual Pass did a good job with that. I play the game a ton so eventually I run out of content, but the Annual Pass made it so I only had a few weeks with nothing new to do instead of months like some of the times in Destiny 1.
---
# you will, of course, keep all of your progress and absolutely not have to rebuy anything that you already own.

+ hand cannon enhanced loader = shoot forever

yeah no it's stated that she's one if not the most powerful hunter of all time but we're just gonna forget about that and let her send you off to do everything
---
Year 1 mayrters make
---
Yes.
---
my kill clip / rampage transfiguration wants a word
---
Agreed
---
I just watched that episode, what a great show!
---
Oh, I'm a dumbass. Cheers!
---
I prefer kill clip in PvP because it gives you the same boost as a full stack of rampage. It‚Äôs a lot easier to kill one person and proc 3 crit kill than kill 3 people to proc the 3 hit kill. At first I wanted outlaw, and the roll I was going for initially was outlaw/kill clip, but a 4 stack of rapid hit essentially gives you the same reload speed as outlaw while having the added benefit of zen moment. At this point I like rapid hit more than outlaw. Drop mag is cool for PvP though.
---
Jesus Christ I hope this gets nerfed to hell, this is so braindead and you can‚Äôt even counter it, shit‚Äôs annoying as hell
---
FOR THE PUPPIES
---
It‚Äôs the perfect stratagem!
---
Have you played any Iron Banner? Because its exactly that.
---
Hey baby!
---
This was definitely needed but once you solo your way to Fabled 3 or Heroic, you don't drop any lower but also don't get closer to Legend. In my experience, i usually lose a match and win 2 or win a match and lose 2.
---
Wym? MT, Recluse  and Anarchy is literally the current meta PvE loadout there is nothing better.
---
I just wanna see more hive weaponry in general. Imagine an exotic hive sword that lets you summon a shield like a knight. Or the cannons that the knights use. Maybe even a hive trace rifle. I'd much rather have new hive themed exotics than monte carlo and ten hand cannons.
---
Gottem
---
Your*
---
just to clarify, this is to masterwork a piece of armor. You can still acquire the legendary set and then MW it later!
---
Now i gotta find it, and kill it
---
High effort post
---
I did an oopsie
---
Hopefully in a future dlc my friend
---
Not like anyone else had even mediocre writing
---
I finally achieved my first Crucible Pinnacle weapon (Recluse) as a PvE player. I was determined to get the weapon because of it's viability in PvE, and I had a sense of urgency in order to get my MMXIX title (this was the last triumph I needed for the title, so now I have MMXIX too!). 
---
After being stuck at 900-1,100 for most of this season solo-queuing, I finally bit the bullet and did an LFG for a group around my same level. I had to do it dirty using my Striker Titan OEM, LoW, Blast Furnace, Truth (sorry guys). We grinded for about 5 hours and finally got above 2,000 last Saturday, so I got everything on reset Tuesday. 
---
Now I can go back to Warlock PvE until I get caught up on everything else and decide to try for Mountaintop.
---
lol.no
---
I have great luck with Arbalest, recluse and a SotR. Arby melts heads.
---
Its alright. I told someone to pump the *breaks* yesterday.
---
at least  you'll be done next week, ja?
---
Titan supers are mainly used for crowd control. Titans can clear a crowd more effectively than other classes, but lack the boss DPS imo.
---
Cheers
---
I have that same issue!
---
Welp, looks like the leviathan is here. Time to go and set up a fireteam
---
This is awesome :)))
---
It was random drop so no not really in Trials though
---
Thank you this is awesome!
---
thanks /u/mega-primus for the pic of the engrams
---
Never-ending fists of havoc guardian!!
---
Could be made way better by adding some maps and nerfing one eyed mask...
---
I want matchmaking in raid and harder content
---
Correct
---
I feel like Bungie created a shit show so that people would stop playing D1.
---
So we back in the mars
---
Welp, let's see whether Google image search can do me good
---
Is there any equipment/gear/weapon that can only be will soon be no longer obtainable once New Light is released?
---
Tbh it‚Äôs not even hard to get, if you tried but you can‚Äôt get it you don‚Äôt deserve it imo
---
Find a character you think best fits your playstyle. Are you aggressive in firefights? Like mobility more than survivability?  Chose a hunter
---
Like to be a defensive class? Enjoy tanking damage and then dishing it back out twice as hard? Chose titan.
---
Like to be a supportive role? Wanna focus on health, recovery, and abilities? Choose a warlock.
---
Then you're gonna need to find weapons, theres scout rifles, auto rifles, hand cannons, pulse rifles, sidearms, smgs... the list goes on and on, experiment until you find something you like. Never try to stay with only one though because patches come every Tuesday so what was bad one day might be op the next.
---
And find other new players! Theres so much you can do with a good group of people who are also new. Form fireteams of three people and go exploring , or get a fireteam of 6 Duke it out in crucible. And then when you think your ready there are endgame raids you can go into.
---
Destiny is such a fun game to play with and make friends with, so I hope you have a blast :)
---
The only real thing you would lose out on is the trials gear, but even if they make a year 3 version you will need to earn it again anyway.
---
Show me in this doll where it is a titan with OEM and fist of havoc touched you because I've been shot down from that super and I've also shot them down. 
---
  O

Have an updoot, also, title have me a heart attack!

I sadly dont have access to the really heavy weapons but I have a 727 light linear fusion rifle that 2 shots

Another generic clan recruitment post -        
---
With the launch of Shadowkeep we're looking to get more people into our clan.      
---
There's no rules as such and the only requirement is that you be exceptionally good at either PvE activities or PvP, and to be willing to help clanmates on the other side of the spectrum if they need it.      
---
As with any other clan, we have a core team and are mostly PvP oriented as of now, so if you think you'd fit in, send a request to the link posted below. 
---
Clan name : Raptors 
---
Strength : 24
---
Max rank in seasons 1,2,3,4 and 7 Created : 12/31/14

---
I had no idea you could do that
---
I'll have to agree as well. Got the two rolls I wanted within my first 200 vanguard tokens. I wanted so much to love that gun, but 2 crit 2 body is rough even with the high rate of fire of 180s.  
---
Then there's Last Word \[PC\]. Just crossed 1k kills with that gun. It's nutty.  
---
Then there is the impressive range of Spare Rations \*and\* the movement bonus from the lightweight frame. I want so much to love 180s but it's hard to recommend them.
---
Are you playing on a game cube?
---
Oh god man, I‚Äôm so sorry, I hope you get what *WE* are expecting
---
I did not either, I was helping my buddy through the missions and I couldn't help but hop on it. You can't take it out of the area unfortunately.
---
1 day per armor set. So, about 6 days.
---
Cayde set up a dare. Who ever kills him gets everything he has. That includes the vanguard position. Which means uldren now is the rightful owner of the ace of spades and the new vanguard leader
---
Aw, thank you!
---
Superblack
---
To access Forsaken and Forsaken Annual Pass content, you need to have purchased Forsaken and Forsaken Annual Pass on the platform you are playing on.
---
I was killed by weapons i didnt even knew the name today...cant imagine in a month!
---
Oh yeah, all items on the store u till unlocked in game are that cost.
---
Happened to me in the menagerie in the engine room that's between the theater and the room where you fight Arunak. This was when the chest glitch was still active so you imagine how fun it was being cycled by 5 other players reviving you only for you to constantly fall in between platforms (repeatedly) I must've died   
---
15 times before I got to revive on my own..
---
It really isn‚Äôt that vague.
---
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre factoring in ***your*** skill value to Glory gains and losses‚Äù
---
If he meant they would factor in Glory difference, he would‚Äôve said that
---
I have not and now I want to
---
That's true, but we don't know if that will happen.
---
I cant wait for all the i thought this was supposed to be easier posts once this drops. Now its going to be much more difficult to hide a bad player in comp teams. Theres going to be ton of stop being mean and kicking bad players from comp teams posts. Carrying is going to be a ton harder when you get that one crappy blueberry that keeps burning your lives.
---
Press your guide button.
---
Now hit LB twice.
---
Go down and select "Looking For Group".
---
Select Destiny 2.
---
Profit.
---
I won a gambit match by myself because all my teammates we‚Äôre using afk bots as well as the enemy team. I was the only person actually playing.
---
I never realized that there was a platform right beneath that. I always just jumped from the vent to the ball. I have done the campaign 5 times.
---
**your** glory can be considered a skill value. And by that logic if he meant performance he would have said performance.
---
Ye dont play pvp
---
I don‚Äôt think the game lets you do Dreaming city strikes until you unlock it. Same way that people who haven‚Äôt got curse of Osiris can never load into the Tree of Probabilities strike.
---
Depends on situation. JuJu for super regen when no flags available. If I need range I use a pulse rifle. If I want to do damage at medium to close range a HC.
---
I honestly can't wait to go for Legend in solo. I hate solo queuing because i always feel punished by bad teammates and ive never pushed past fabled in solo queue. I consider myself a pretty good Crucible player and tend to do well in Rumble, so Legend actually seems attainable now, which is crazy to me.
---
I want that as a wallpaper for my pc!!!
---
You have three classes and they've always been the same. Titan, Warlock and Hunter. üëç
---
Did you do it?
---
It should, otherwise why would it let me do the strike on playlist?
---
Better said, the designs of this ‚Äúartifacts‚Äù are shown in some clips, and this artifact... got McDonalded
---
Does it belong to a man who lives in a blue box?
---
My go to is Chattering Bone
---
I would say it will have some noticable changes, primarily the ability to pick and choose your armor mods to match your playstyle and look good doing it. The 750 boost will help you immediately get caught up and ready. Come back for Shadowkeep, its the perfect time.
---
Won‚Äôt work there‚Äôs multiple farms based on campaign progress
---
Whether i wanted it or not, i decided to level a warlock. So let's start by getting those power levels, one by one.
---
I mean the subclasses, blade barrage, novas warp ect
---
Or when they end up being 10x better than you and you drag them down
---
-30 points ahaha that's brilliant
---
Make shaxx appear on the side of the team getting stomped just before they get mercied to help out
---
Gotcha. üëç
---
Assists also add up to your score, without actually being relevant for the win.
---
Pray to RNGeesus.
---
which video is it?
---
It reflects every projectile and energy weapon while you slide.This applies to supers.
---
Put simply: it tracks actual kills as points, but awards player opponents defeated with an assist. Thats why your numbers add up to a higher total, but you lost. Hopefully that helps.
---
Assists count in the "opponents defeated" but not towards the match score.
---
What‚Äôs the top perk that‚Äôs selected? Never seen it.
---
It‚Äôs a random drop, you can‚Äôt just get it, but xur might sell it somewhere in the future.
---
My brother bought me overwatch so I could play with him. And man keyboard and mouse is great :D. So I'm getting some FPS gameplay in and one of the characters widow maker is like a sniper so I been practicing alot with that one.
---
I can‚Äôt wait for my friends to actually appreciate me again.
---
There's no best way. You can just hope that either Xur sells it or you get a random drop.
---
Ok but don‚Äôt go out here calling stuff OP or Broken if you don‚Äôt have all the info. That‚Äôs how we get unnecessary nerds in crucible. LoW pre fix? Broken. AoS on PC? Good, but not broken.
---
You missed xur selling them like 2 weeks ago :(
---
Captain Holt?
---
This is the only right answer.
---
Enhanced Heavy Lifting
---
Rng/xur
---
I don't know, both are pretty rubbish to be honest. Definitely not the favourite child when compared to pve. Still, could be worse, could be adopted like gambit.
