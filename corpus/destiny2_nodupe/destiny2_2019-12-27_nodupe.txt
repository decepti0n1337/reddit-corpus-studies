It‚Äôs not a bug.  It‚Äôs a feature! Lol

---
I mean he did go hand to hand with a cabal and won.
---
*hits head against wall* There. Are. Work. Arounds. Please. Stop. Complaining. You. Entitled. Children.
---
Not everyone has Shadowkeep.
---
The objective doesn't say "camp this heavy for maybe one kill". It doesn't require you to camp heavy for any longer than the time it spawns. Should quests never be more complicated than "get kill" just so people don't think too hard and mess up a game?
---
Thank you :)
---
If you are on ps4, i can confirm that you can set your clock back 1 hour for it to work the first time. Then you can turn the time back and itll work
---
I disagree. I got to 969 with those being the main power boosts.
---
Yeah, I've been trying to tell people he's nowhere near Greek but they see the thing on his helmet and assume that indicates his nationality
---
Yes includes the season but not the season pass. Original Shadow keep gave everyone the season pass for Season of Undying. But that is over.
---
wait?! i didnt know they had one on titan. is that a glitch or a foreshadow ?
---
Then that's their problem.
---
Wait why I'm hearing the Soviet anthem?
---
No offense, but if you have two teams of equal skill with the score close, the team that controls heavy is going to win.
---

---
"Good players" also normally enjoy winning, which normally requires heavy control.
---
What is this, runescape?
---
You can buy the pass for 1000 silver wich is 10‚Ç¨/$
---
I set my ps4s clock a few hours back and now I never have an issue
---
On Xbox one, it says "Season Pass for season of dawn" I bought the Upgrade edition today
---
Zavala is why Titans are cowards. Spend all their time hiding behind walls and too afraid to fight. Saint 14 is a true Titan. The Titan of Titans. Saint 14 fought his way out of the Infinite Forest. Zavala would've just laid down and died.
---
You forgot the part where Hawthorne had ti save his sorry ass.
---
Shit I'm just trying to catch up on these tedious obelisk bounties. Not even close to enough time to do this Iron Banner.
---
They kinda already did with Sanguine alchemy and Foetracer.
---
Again, you are blaming people playing poorly on a quest step. It is not the quest step's fault that people don't understand that you don't need to be next to heavy until it spawns.
---
Yes, Bungie should be catering exclusively to the lowest common denominator, just like Y1 Destiny 2, which we can all agree was the Best Year Ever for Bungie and Destiny.
---
Probably would have been faster to sample 26 letters and use that as an alphabet but you do you
---
It's just rng. However the battle pass will drop base 64-66 armor pieces for each class this season. That's 76-78 masterworked, plus whatever mods you add.
---
The deluxe edition contained all of the season's passes but that doesn't exist anymore. You can only buy the passes each by each when they start. Maybe idiot microsoft just idiot.
---
You should contact Microsoft/Xbox live agents tomorrow. 
---
If you bought wrong one, they might be able to help. Like, refund, you delete and buy right edition.
---
I'm down. Shit would be awful but fuck it let's go
---
It works fine
---
That would have been lazy, and would have ruined the whole point of the meme.
---
So when you buy shadowkeep it does not include the season pass for season of dawn? Because if so imma storm Microsoft HQ
---
How do you even get better at crucible cause whenever I play I just get stomped by literally everyone on the enemy team.
---
The stag is underrated give it a try
---
It happens when u load into a game and there are empty spots on each side
---
i just went and dismantled a skull dire of amkhara or however you spell it from my warlock, it gave me an ascendant shard back
---
System? Also try r/fireteams
---
Titan needs a raid
---
Must perch!
---
It says " Destiny 2: Shadowkeep includes a digital copy of the game and a single Season Pass, providing exclusive activities and rewards. "
---
"and a single season pass" which was for the previous season.
---
It was only true for the Season of Undying.
---
The drop chance is very low, just did got the ikelos shotty today myself after 10-12 runs.
---
Indeed, were you one of the many people commenting RIP Cayde in the comments?
---
3 times a game (assuming there isn't a mercy rule on either side, and that you're around it for any of those times) isn't the same as every 30 seconds. I mean, yeah, the grenade quest probably took longer in total but could not nearly be as frustrating
---
I‚Äôm doing that exact same partüò≠üò≠
---
Not in the slightest. I have a 2-3 k/d in every cod, yet I'm not afraid to complain about some broken gun, perk, or mechanic. 
---
Again, it solely your assumption that I'm bad, because that's the easiest thing for your small mind to fall back on when confronted with legitimate criticism.
---
The fan theory of Savathin impersonating would make that bad acting make sense. Like it's trying to mimick a person but sounds like a bored phoned in actor being paid per line.
---
One of those people who was playing Solo Queue crucible before Tuesday?
---
So wait, if im seeing this correctly, using the void shield mod inthe artifact gives an overshield when making a shield? Does it give one when throwing a grenade or punching?
---
Hard to tell these days when people complain about literally everything. Just saying.
---
agreed. i hate pvping especially whrn I have to use weapons I don't normally use. in pve its not so bad but in pvp its the worst.
---
Witcher 3 replay for me.
---
Am I not wrong?
---
This is honestly, the best warlock exotic from a VISUAL standpoint, why make it so bad perkwise? Why bungo T.T
---
You have to make it to the rank above fabled 3- it's written wrong.
---
you will get more fps thanks to the rgb of the saintly shell mohawk.
---
I want it
---
Yeah I know it‚Äôs a mission, but isn‚Äôt the only way you can redo it is with the heroic adventures? Or if not how do you redo it
---
Ah ok thanks. I was worrying a lot for a second.
---
Yet this quest has legitimate reasons for complaints. Here's a youtuber who's very good at PvP that shares my thoughts. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZIfzMdbRfI
---
I think you're the one that is confused. The post is asking specifically about armor for Titans.
---
My ghost watching me fuck up a simple jumping puzzle for the fifteenth time in a row

Since when did it matter whether you win or lose in PvP/Gambit? Outside of comp there is no detriment.
---
What are those words?
---
Intelligence - 4 (fingers)
---
No problem Guardian.
---
I've seen more good players complain about even having heavy in a match *at all,* and only control heavy if the opponent is using it as a crutch
---
The vanguard tab has replayable story missions. 
---
Left side.
---
You are correct. Those mods don't work in pvp. But you can actually use the scavenger mods to get extra ammo from the ammo bricks other players drop when killed though.
---
You‚Äôre smiley wins the day
---
The only reason why this would not piss you off is if you emply the same tactic.
---

So my second point was correct.
---
Yes

I'm not saying it doesn't have issues. I'm just being a troll. I f*ck with PvP community all the time.

I would say twin tailed fox is a nice option as well.

Who cares? Just because they get away with it in another games should mean they should be allowed to here as well. They break TOS and EULA, they deserve to be banned.
---
Aside from the warlock but, yes. Technically classes are techniques used to shape light in a specific way, no ability is truly ‚Äúlocked out‚Äù (aside from gameplay purposes) for guardians. Drifter is  not known to be of any affinity of classes, probably because he is just the Drifter. Drifter is his class i guess.
---
I am now cheers

Lol I remember and I am 11

Still waiting for my update email üò¢

See  why he is a legendary warlock? Because nobody can wear sun bracer and lunafaction. Fkin cheater
---
I camt stand his voice and the way he talks
---
Why is Byf?
---
So what you're saying is we gotta spend to get the cool looking stuff?
---
hello everyone, apologies for the late reply on this thread. Ive recently "optimized" my game through the nvidia control panel which did things automatically for me. I captured a video of the game after the optimization process with the fps display on and i noticed that my fps doesnt go up to 60 fps. and when there are plenty of things to display like explosions and stuff the fps even drops. i wonder what is going on?

You do know tea bagging is supposed to be over the players body and not from 100ft away

 I would assume loading restrictions plus areas that aren‚Äôt playable, just a picture are the reasons why. Every game has an edge.
---
I want to like him because I love the lore, but I hate his voice.
---
With the current range fusion rifles now have, it's a dirty way to play. But a kill's a kill.

Any source on that? First I‚Äôve heard of cayde being forced in

Dude one-two punch/liars handshake combo is the only thing I use with my hunter in PVE. Even post nerf it‚Äôs still incredible.

Pretty dangerous mentality. A lot of non-functioning addicts start out as high-functioning addicts, addiction isn't only a problem once it starts negatively impacting your life.
---
So the power is how much the gun does?
---
Well ok but for the general public who don't have those it would probably not be great
---
Don't worry man a lot of people are in agreement with you there
---
LUCKILY that is the last step which is "nice"
---
If it makes it any better I t-bagged because mister was a toxic clan kid
---
Wasn't last season's armour more reminiscent to that of an igloo?
---
No problem, happy to inform so that bungie may realize one day that its tracking could chill a little
---
It's not that bad really. It took me like 3 games to get the rocket kills. I was using wardcliff

Hahaha it was crazy...

Oof. Glad I haven‚Äôt bothered

I don't care. I love this. Good job on the glorious recreation comrade.

probably you can barely see the fps on the upper right most part of the screen but it only goes from 43 to 55 and sometimes 60 but it doesnt stay there. feels like im playing on ps4 all over again lol.

The first option on the mod equipping bar should be a blank space, which will let you unequip the mod inhabiting that slot.

Yes.

Irrational people often get hung up on rational responses, so I don't blame you. But you seem thick-headed as well. Did you not read the part about them likely not knowing there is a workaround? Holy fucking shit. Yes - you are correct - those who DO know the workaround can deal with it. But many people don't know about one. You are in no way justified for anything you've assumed was a valid contribution to the discussion. And you don't have a strong grasp on what "clearly" means, so here's saving you from having to look it up yourself:

Oh look, another rant about having to kill 10 guardians with a rocket launcher in an event that's meant to to last 3 weeks over a 3 month period.
---
i just mean that some areas are a bit over restrictive imo, even if some areas arent rendered to the same detail as the main area it would be nice if you could at least walk around them for a bit, or better yet simply design the worlds boundaries with physical barriers as i think invisible walls are a bit lazy
---
Yeah that's what I want to know too. Not that I can actually load into any forges in a group. Seems no one plays them any more.
---
Toxic basalt (maybe basalt toxic) also does this!

That's the plan!

Someone else said this already dang

Watch people start a petition to have a new Speaker occupy the tower quarters as a non-interactive NPC - and Byf does the voice work so you hear him talking to himself about various lore

Settle down Titan

Ada sells a consumable that‚Äôs grants a piece of armor upon successfully forging a weapon, when I did it for my rare bounty I was missing 4 pieces I did it 4 times and all the time I got a piece that I didn‚Äôt have, I don‚Äôt know if I was extremely luck or it works that way, I know weekly bounty always give you a piece you don‚Äôt have but I‚Äôm not sure about the consumable.
---
They'd be more valuable if we could get a hand full of bright dust from them. Even more if we pick up an exotic engram.
---
Hmmm, this is an incredibly easy Ordeal compared to others, so I‚Äôm not sure what exactly to tell you. If you guys are having trouble with this one, it might just be a skill problem. 
---
I‚Äôm saying this because you could honestly run any class/subclass and weapons you want, and still be able to beat this one with a 100K pretty easily.
---
Me too. And I think you are right! Didn't think about it until now. Lol
---
God I hated this mission so much,too annoying and stressful for such a mediocre pulse rifle

I was in the EDZ in front of the flooded chasm lost sector, but I know you can also do it in the hallows on Nessus cause there‚Äôs another door there where enemies pour out (the door ppl used to get the chained kills for the sunshot catalyst)
---
Really? I think arms dealer was way way way easier. There wasn‚Äôt any champs at the end. More over, Last week‚Äôs ordeal was pretty easy as well unstoppable champs pretty much go down easily. 
---
The Overload champs here are present in 2/3 of the boss phases and they are accompanied by Barrier champs. 
---
Or I guess it‚Äôs all just an excuse for being a damn noob?
---
Titan is always so fucking amazing it ignites my imagination. It gives me a sort of wonder because it looks so realistic. The arcologies and the ships in the methane ocean, there‚Äôs wave energy pistons in the back for using the tidal energy for producing electricity. On your first look, the ocean looks so dangerous and intimidating. The waves are large as hell and the ocean looks like a naturally destructive place but then you see all the human structures towering over the place. It‚Äôs almost as daunting as the leviathan. Really puts old humanity into perspective. During the golden age the human empire was indomitable. The tanks are powerful enough to lay waste to hundreds of hive monsters. The weapons we use from the past - infused with light of course - are able to take down large hive ogres and monsters. 
---
Titan has the perfect atmosphere of technology that looks very much like in our present time but much more large scale manufactured. Makes me really wonder if humankind can actually get to that level some day. The arcologies have stood the test of time and even have power running inside. Despite the darkness having taken over and destroyed everything, these structures are battlefields with running power and lights. Enemies of the light fight everyday against human guardians, but on our home turf.
---
You‚Äôre out of luck for now buddy, sorry.
---
I‚Äôm right there with you.  It‚Äôs *totally* worth ad free if you can budget for it ...I have it for both Hulu and YouTube.
---
I finished the quest last night and I literally yelled in relief. It feels so good to be able to use the gun I want to again! That was pure torture. 
---
I don‚Äôt know how anyone gets it playing solo. The only thing that helped me get through it was to have a friend covering me and looking out for the heavy ammo to pop up, or keeping track of who took it so we could kill them.
---
Damn, I get 4k 60 FPS hdr with ultra or 1080p 144fps ultra with 9700k 2080ti
---
Somethings not right, u should be getting above 100 easily
---
It's a bug that's being investigated. Don't abandon the quest until we get an update from Bungie.
---
That‚Äôs not an issue though. It will effectively block modded accounts. There‚Äôs no downside for the community. Bungie isn‚Äôt making money off of these accounts either so here‚Äôs no downside there either.
---
I was meaning that China would cause contraversy. I'm all for the bans
---
Bruh I‚Äôm getting meg downvoted. For anyone who doesn‚Äôt get this meme- it‚Äôs about how when you get saint 14 you have to defeat boss at the end. And he talks like how shaxx does in crucible. He‚Äôs like ‚ÄúONE FOR TWO!!! I LIKE IT!!‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm not getting , why I‚Äôm having problems . I heard and optimization for destiny isn‚Äôt much of a priority tho
---
No no no, not the trickster, ‚ÄúTricky Ricky‚Äù if you will (Th3Jez reference)

Sealed ahamkara grasps
---
Maybe you should try considering differing viewpoints instead of calling them trash, you disagreeable person.
---
Iron banner is a shit show at the moment trying to get tokens to farm a claws of the wolf and getting into 6v5 or 5v4 all the time nobody is really playing the objective just camping heavy to get the launcher kills done, trying to get wins without a 6 stack is basically not happening and it sucks because it‚Äôs bungie that have caused the state of iron banner with the quest and the way matchmaking is set up.
---
Yeah i wouldnt worry about it at this point. Its an issue that Bungie knows about and are trying to fix right now. I enquired about it on their help forums and they responded that theyre trying to figure it out. Not much more we can do about it than wait.
---
You still get tokens for losing, and it happens to your opponents as much as it happens to you.
---
That quest literally turned me into a suicide bomber. I can't aim rocket launchers for shit so I just super right when the heavy ammo is about to spawn, kill the enemy team who always go for it even though my teammates never seem to want it, grab heavy ammo, shoot at the feet of the closest other enemy even though it would kill me.
---
It took me 15 or so matches for that quest alone.
---
Well... it does kinda teach new kinderguardians about the importance of heavy control... albeit forgoing the objective and teamwork..
---
Ghost has RGB
---
high level comp doesn't take light level into damage calc, though
---
I think I should start letting people farm me for rocket kills. It was hell for me so it might help them out
---
BANG BANG BANG
---
#KITCHEN GUN
---
I should probably also add, in PvE, any Guardians in my vicinity are welcome to the orbs of light I'm literally shitting out of my masterworked bow.
---
1 token yay
---
Mithrax. I had him in my Gambit once, with his whole crew. His whole crew wiped the taken, plus the Dusk Fallen I cooped up. I wanted the Guardian to deliver him some of my surplus boxes of dark chocolate motes, but I figured I shouldn't bring too much attention to ol' Mith.
---
I reckon this mandatory quest, although a royal pain in the ass, forces the players outside their comfort zones to try out new weapon types, and find new play styles.. but i dont think the rocket launcher step was productive....
---
This! This was by far the most efficient way for me to get the quest step. The alternative was trying to one tap a flying target which I'm just not good enough to do.
---
While I agree with you, I can understand why players (in some cases) choose to ignore the Drifter. Damn daily bounties vs pushing the objective.
---
5 for losing and 10 for winning, unless you're still playing D1?
---
I always feel like an idiot when I don't land it the first time.
---
Those six numbers are cursed, they're a reference to a manga.
---
Oh boy here i go suggesting agian!
---
I just wait and pump a few grav lance bursts in there and wait for the fireworks...
---
Thank god im not alone. as a main hunter with double jump it‚Äôs a death wish
---
Sorry, taken portal had a stutter there. Couldn't tell ya why, but my ship wasn't havin' it.
---
that's the same thought i had. but it gets out of Hand when you Need tp carry four other random Players against a 6 stack.
---
This is for a build I‚Äôm using. Do you not know how to get the armor for it?
---
They going to invade with 10 motes
---
Very nice. Too bad it doesn‚Äôt have guiding light.
---
‚ÄúDismantles‚Äù
---
"But yeah, Bungie basically makes it a requirement to play iron banner becuase the rewards way overshadow every other activity."
---
Not for me this time. Maybe I had bad rng but I turned in 300 tokens and the highest stat armour piece dropped at 57. Complete waste of my time. I got better drops from the season pass. The 4 pinnacles dropped across the same 2 slots, so no real power gain either. Should have just gone and played Witcher instead.
---
But did it get the obelisk to work?
---
It is a two round gametype where invasions and pugs ruin the day.
---
Also there are quite a few players myself included that only play it for bounties and weapon quests.
---
Indeed, it was pointed out to me earlier on and I edited the post accordingly. üëç The audio sound of the knife connecting caught me out I guess. üòÖ
---
Well, out of 4 EPs that I did since my first comment here, ive gotten a pair of boots, a mark and 2 chests so there is probably a joke in here somewhere :D. But yeah, chests are unlimited now too. Which is great honestly. I kinda like doing EP and am only missing the damn sniper.
---
Well shame it's shotgun this week

U can add me if u want.

I normally play everyday after work.

Important reminder, don‚Äôt fire your rocket launcher whilst still in your bubble. Make sure you‚Äôve stepped out before you hit fire.
---
So, im still new to these random perks and dont know what a good roll for dead man walking is, i have one with tactical mag, outlaw and rampage
---
You gotta do that quest to get normal ghorn to use the iron one but I don't know why you would seeing as it's 3 attack and the normal ghorn drops at I think 320 or 350 from the quest
---
A lack of skill
---
Does everyone have the same shader on their recluse? I swear that‚Äôs all I see. (It‚Äôs a great shader and I use it on mine.)
---
Cuz that's how you titan
---
Shit. Yes.
---
Bungie actually giving a shit about PvP or caring about improving it? you do realize how funny that is?
---
Works with Skele-Ghaul too!
---
Why do you think I said ‚Äúclaims‚Äù
---
I know. I want a hakke LMG so bad
---
You start the campaign from the icon at the bottom of the Tangled Shore map, I believe.
---
Awesome, thank you.
---
I'd rather say they should go for the Snowball shell. It also has Guiding Light and it smiles for you
---
*the sound of a scorn rifle charging*
---
out of all the pinnacles I have done it was the most enjoyable then again I just played Anti Invader with Triple shotgun 
---
Cannon Paradox and Ikelos
---
If you main PvP and Iron Banner is your only source of high-stat gear, having to wait a whole month for another chance to earn it sucks. Particularly if like me you're traveling for the holidays and will only get 1 or maybe 2 days to play before reset, so I'll still be grinding the quest next Banner. And I have to have the quest sitting in my inventory taking up space for a whole month (I have a huge backlog to finish since I don't do much PvE, and regularly run out of room while picking up bounties.)
---
#Keksis, the Betrayed!
---
I had this happen alot my ghost hates me
---
Which means players have even more time to do the objectives in between Power ammo spawns.
---
We must be playing a different game
---
Did I miss some news about a bunch of CoD playing kids switch to D2 to whine because it's actually a real game that requires effort?
---
I see where people come from with camping it as such but I generally didn't do this, I checked the time now and then and came back when it would be 20-10 seconds remaining, grabbed a rocket got a kill or two and carried on, still coming top of the team. I'm running top tree trapper with the helmet that extends invisibility, graviton lance, and parcel of stardust. Bad omens rocket launcher with tracking. I must have gotten good teams or faced bad teams, I'm trying to help people finish it currently but just didn't see any difficulty in this step :/
---
Nightmare inducing.
---
Just started the rocket launcher part. Got three kills. Hopefully I‚Äôll get the rest done fairly quickly on Sunday. Sorry to my teammates capturing zones. I‚Äôll be camping the heavy.
---
As a titan main i dont count zavala
---
Effort? Run around with a titan or warlock and use your 1 hitters while spamming shotguns and snipers/arbalest? Much effort.
---
Just gotta Suicide Wardcliff, thats how i did it. Still a pain in the ass that took 23 games to get 10 kills though
---
I‚Äôve just started the rocket launch phase. At around 500 tokens. Let‚Äôs see if I can match you.
---
The biggest problem is that once you pick up the quest, you HAVE to complete it in order to turn in tokens and get your engrams üò≠
---
**STAY BACK**
---
I did one match with roar of the bear and went and got warcliff out of the vault. Immediately got a double kill. Fingers crossed.
---
Im terrible at pvp but 3 times during my grind for recluse i won a round 1 v 4 and it was the most amazing feeling
---
have you turned it off and on again? 
---
have you tried killing it?
---
did you use any weapons? 
---
maybe try to do the mechanics?
---
OOHH now i got it, kill it, while using the boss mechanics and doing damage in 2 or 3 phases. Have u tried this?
---
Yesterday i killed one guy 3 times just after he got the heavy ammo in a row, aaaaand he left the match
---
I'll do that, thanks, I've heard good things from a few D2 players as well so I'm curious to see if I'll enjoy it as well
---
You could in the old days, but it promoted have 3 chars of the same class to do pinnacles on so they changed it to the new system where u can do it once per class like this guy said
---
Welcome to Destiny?
---
I know but honestly this is making the iron banner unbearable, the last before this was so funny now it's only frustrating, I'll try later cause I need the last quest to get a a higher tier engram but for now I will not take a part in that..
---
Anyone know what they mean ? Lol
---
Well then, thx for not being a contraverse crosmapper abuser :D
---
Lmao it‚Äôs but it‚Äôs the perfect counter to slide shotgunning apes
---
For his neutral special, he wields a gun.
---
Why the fuck would you run 3 warlocks?? Lol
---
I have a quickdraw/rangefinder roll and its amazing
---
Theres also a gun thats just a glock, the sidearms have stronger inspiration from reality than other types.
---
They can grab the power ammo too. It‚Äôs active for your fire team for five seconds after the first person takes it.
---
Pretty sure the drifter has something to say about that. But hey, the way your sword connected to that first scorn was pretty satisfying
---
Aim assist ftw
---
I‚Äôd argue when I did that step one my 3 characters was the most team oriented play of the whole grind. Not playing as a team to win, but most people don‚Äôt do that outside comp anyways imo, but playing as team to control heavy. Have the time IB this season has turned into a single objective instead of 3: who can get heavy. People are saving supers for heavy spawn instead of power plays etc.
---
Any recommendations for a PS4 mega clan?
---
Only with the second and third characters lol
---
Bungie already said he is russian
---
I would use the Ace. Plenty of other snipers but the Ace is one of if not the best exotic hand cannons. I'm still using Ace today.
---
VINDICATION!!!
---
He's the arbabest
---
It's a reference to the [Unveiling](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/categories/book-unveiling) lore book.
---
Well developing an app for something that should be an in game function is a useful tool for mining data from your players to sell to advertisers, which is really not the same thing. 
---
It's not inconceivable for someone to not want a 3rd party app brought in on every game they play, when the features the app offers are just things the game developers should have put into the game in the first place.
---
I found that just playing like normal and grabbing heavy when it‚Äôs available worked well. Goal being one rocket kill per match (knowing I would play many more than 10 matches).
---
I would be happy if i could raid with people in "The Protectors of Light 1"

There‚Äôs also a S9 exotic quest coming up in a little bit. Sounds like an exotic fusion rifle. Check the S9 calendar on Bungie‚Äôs site.
---
I scream laughed yesterday when I had just super hammered someone and their teammate avenged them only to emote in the remaining flame from my hammer and also died.
---
Lemon Arch is just so good in pvp tho lmao
---
But the key is finding someone/likely a team to teach you. For casuals who can only hop on at infrequent intervals to grind its hard to "meet" people or have any core friends to play with regularly.
---
I also do not own Forsaken, and i didn't have a problem with any of the recipes.
---
(I cant gift Riven, but thats other problem)
---
I just saw the rules sorry.
---
Well done.  That had  better be some Spicy Ramen in that bowl!!!

Ace is good for pvp, but you're better off with Darci in pve if youre looking for optimal dps.
---
They can roll with ~50 stat points all split between mobility, resilience and recovery usually with 20-30 allocated to one. Have one with 38 base mobility, friend has once with 32 base recovery
---
I have 38 mobility, a friend has 32 recovery both before mods
---
Last wish gloves and last seasons iron banner are good.

Don't. One thing you should realize is that we all suck. Unless you are part of a dedicated team that trains I think it should be expected that you will wipe once or twice. So long as you are not going for a flawless run or are on a major time crunch you should be fine. Bring you best equipment/what you work best with. Sure Izanagi's might be the "Hive's Knees", but if you just don't work with it well and are better with another sniper then go with that. 
---
I usually message the poser first letting them know that "I am new to raiding and haven't done this raid/dungeon, or have done it once." Generally if they are not a "KWTD" or "Nedd X clears" group then you'll be fine. Just don't try and pretend to know what you are doing if you don't. If you have a question ask it. If you are going the "fake it 'till you make it" route you will get found out pretty quick. 
---
If you are new, and you were up front about being new, but the group still gets pissy/is rude/gives you shit for asking questions? Screw them. You probably don't want to play with them. I would rather spend the time to answer 20 questions and make sure everyone is operating out of the same playbook then constantly wipe because bob didn't know he was supposed to punch the A &amp; C buttons if I said "B".
---
Just make sure to pay attention to the other members and know what roles you get assigned/chose to do. Also don't have a bunch of gear that is below the recommended LL for the raid. That will probably just be a PITA.
---
That play and edit at 40 seconds were great lol
---
It lets me know not to dismantle it
---
It's still useable. I've found a full squad and my clan has looked for one or two to fill slots. Y'all just got social anxiety.
---
Just to help
---
You don‚Äôt actually need Forsaken for this I have no idea why the message pops up but it‚Äôs bullshit so ignore t
---
I really wish they‚Äôd bring back the exotic version of that gun. It wasn‚Äôt the best exotic, but I loved it, it was just fun to use
---
Rocket quest sucked at first, until my FT decided to all run bubble and just camp the heavy by dropping bubbles right on the spawn. Wait for enemy to approach, dip out and launch a deathbringer rocket, profit.
---
I know how it works, I'm just saying to find two bubble buddies willing to be your bodyguards.
---
Check the weapon(s) you‚Äôre using when this happens for any perks that provide explosions on death. I think there are others beyond firefly now.
---
Also check if you‚Äôre running any exotic armor that could provide this.
---
Eh. I was thinking that having ambition assassin loading 3-4 rockets into the mag would make tap the trigger useful by reducing the recoil of the rocket launcher when firing all of the rockets. 
---
Thank you for your research, sir
---
Thanks for that!
---
Hairy clamshell and all? ü§£
---
Yeah i know, but I still sucks
---
GoS was awful to learn, especially when it first came out. It took us 3 hours to get to the final boss (me and one other person were the only two that had never done it) and everyone dipped after a couple of attempts on him.
---
To all new raiders: I would suggest the first 3 raids you do (bc they‚Äôre easy) would be Leviathan, Eater of Worlds, and Scourge of the Past. Those don‚Äôt take very long (levi‚Äôs the longest, probably) and their mechanics aren‚Äôt too difficult if u have a good team.
---
I learned Scourge and EoW in an hour and Levi in an hour and a half or 2.
---
What si the sollution, barely played D1
---
Well if it was team based (shared progress) than it would be much more fun!
---
I mean, our clan does 3-4 raids a week. Although there are some players I've only ever seen play pvp. 
---
Let me know if u want an invite
---
Yes!
---
Petra?
---
That's what I thought
---
Interesting thanks
---
I use it everyday with no problems.  Lol
---
Can you give me a link to the discord
---
Cross save does not transfer the expansions since it was bought on the store from the platform. The season pass transfers though. Its something with the licensing, so if you want to access the expansions on the pc then you'll need to buy them again over there.
---
All DLC should transfer
---
And i would fuckin do it again
---
it's a strike that used to reply the most in D1 back when it barely had any content so the joke is the lines are memorized by every single guardian that is still playing Destiny
---
Not sure if it helps, but I have a Ryzen 3600. Load is always under 10% and my GPU is throttling at 45-60 fps.
---
The guy above just said the opposite I am now more confused
---
Matchmaking actually works for people? I never get anyone in my party and can never find anyone.

I would recommend lfg but unless you get the entire raid done in 5 minutes and not a single person dies, it won‚Äôt help
---
*invades in gambit, 2 seconds later gets a healthy dose of rockets*
---
I want to play the forsaken content but without the ability to play strikes, its hard to even get to that level where I can access it üòë so pc would allow me to level up to access the content, but without expansions I cant üòë
---
I have all the expansions on pc but they don't show up on par or xbox.

---
Raiding is one of the most fun activities in destiny. Once you actually learn them and know how to get reliable teams. Just know that it takes time I think a mistake some people do is hoping into a team of experienced people and pretending like they know what to do. it's far better to get a Sherpa team for your first runs since teams that aren't specifically looking to Sherpa (even if they don't ask for clears or a light level requirement) are most likely looking for a quick clear and won't appreciate taking in new players. Just remember if you join a Sherpa team and people are being assholes or being dicks to you because you don't understand a concept youre better off leaving. People that Sherpa should know what they're getting themselves into and should have the patience to teach the raids to newer people.
---
Yes you do, i got a 4 streak and the game loaded me into a match that ended even before i entered the map and boom there goes my streak. 
---
*Sad Titan noises*
---
You‚Äôre the one lacking common sense, my friend. People are explaining this to you, but you still refuse to accept that just because you bought a SEASON PASS doesn‚Äôt mean you get the in game rewards for free. And the logic behind why you‚Äôre wrong.
---
I read it all, just didn‚Äôt understand what you were saying in the last paragraph, sorry I‚Äôm such a idiot
---
To get from 960 to 970, you'll need pinnacle rewards.

Xbox has a official lfg on destinys official club, it has thousands of lfg posts per day, there is no reason other than time for xbox players to not have a raid clear, due to how easy it is to find groups looking for new players, and if you can't find one make one easy
---
I got mercied 5 times in a row. I feel your pain.
---
Yep. People are so touchy ;). Especially when facts don‚Äôt line up with the world revolving around them
---
PS4 for me!
---
Raids are some of the most fun pieces of content in destiny. If you're on PC I recommend you join the big lfg discord and try to get a group on the Sherpa channel for a raid like leviathan. It might be stressful or confusing but if you get a group willing to teach you the ropes you'll eventually get the hang of it and might enjoy doing other raids in the future.
---
Take that china player
---
I could probably find you easier, I'll just add you now lol.
---
Two Titans, one bubble, only melee. Beat each other to death or take the other one out of the bubble.
---
Yeah ok haha
---
Just my experience but I have been able to play Solo and complete the majority of Story content.
---
This includes story missions, Strikes, Dungeons.
---
Only higher light level stuff require groups like nightfalls and Raids.
---
**Bang**
---
Officer, I am holding a firearm
---
May I ask - what is Sherpa? As I said, I'm really new - only been playing for about 3 weeks.
---
I‚Äôve literally done zero D2 raids. My friends list is 0 and I have social anxiety. But D1? Oh man. Those were the days. Did Crotas End and uhhh the one called something Glass.
---
He is the chosen one!! All hail Titan Lord!!!
---
I got the 4 pinnacles before i completed the quest.There is no need to complete the quest in order to get the pinnacles.The quest only locks the turning in of tokens.Unless bungo somehow made it work differently in different servers.
---
I prefer the Huckleberry bc it has the pre nerf rampage damage multipliers. But it also depends on what special you like to use or if you need izanagi‚Äôs
---
1) you can play non dlc related activities
---
2) you can but you have access to less pinnacles. Up to 960 you can get from anywhere, from 960 to 970 only pinnacles will increase your light level.
---
3) nothing changes to matchmaking if you have or not dlcs
---
4) oldest dlcs are free, only paid content it's forsaken and new stuff
---
5) all of them
---
6) only stuff you can buy is forsaken and shadowkeep. But shadowkeep it's 4 seasons (three months each) which you already missed one. We're 3 weeks in second season and it will last until february probably. Then you can buy next season alone or a pack for next 2 seasons.
---
Way need more people like this in the real and virtual world.

Cool thanks a lot bro.

Hello fellow Guardians! I just purchased stadia and am planning on grinding some destiny through all campaigns and playable content. Two questions for you!

1. What is the most efficient/effective way to play through the game and hit max light?

2. Where can I find other guardians on stadia for teaming up?

Thanks and may the light guide you.

I‚Äôve recently starting using LFG and am doing raids now. I came out of the raids finding out that they aren‚Äôt nearly as hard or complicated as I thought they would be.
---
I feel you tho I prefer to invade cause I can team wipe evertime with symmetry even without any of the build up of the charges
---
It's just an option in the options menu.
---
That‚Äôs when you pop bubble with the HoST14! Everyone is blinded and you‚Äôre invincible.
---
Hasn‚Äôt happened to me at all. When it happens are there just two of you? Usually in strikes if an area doesn‚Äôt load properly it‚Äôs because a third person is loading in and things won‚Äôt work until they land. On rare occasion it won‚Äôt automatically fix when they land so you‚Äôll all need to wipe or backtrack and reload the area.
---
Were looking for new members. Both of you are more then welcome.

This is perfect, thank you. I didn‚Äôt know Xbox had a built in LFG, that‚Äôs awesome information

Are they gonna stick to this set for the whole season or swap back and forth between this set and the Iron Will set from Undying? That armor looks really good and I would love to get some with Dawn mod slots.

 How dare you act like you knew Cayde better than me! He was the best wife's boyfriend I've ever had. He would always satisfy my wife's demands, just so he could let me play some more Destiny 2. He would eat her ass in the day, transfer 15,875 GB of data to her uterus in the night, all for me. In the end, he faced off against Trey the black seagull, my wife's other boyfriend, in a battle for dominance my wife's other boyfriend, and lost. Trey, nor anyone, will ever replace my champ-6-pion. How dare you talk about Chode-69, or VantaBlack Pidgeon, whether you want to or not. Rest in peace, pal.

I've been grinding those a bit, yeah. Just finished Iron Banner so it is relaxing not to have to stress about what to do next.

And just make sure to do it before the match ends?  I could never find a recently played with tab or anything. Thanks!

Everytime I go into pvp I rock a claws of the wolf or a go figure it feels like. I like to pair with a shotgun, usually a parcel of stardust(gambit) or a last man standing (reckoning). Whenever I play gambit I use a sniper, izanagis burden, tranquility, or borealis for invading/killing invaders. None of those are the best in slot or terribly meta guns but they're just what I like. I've always felt like just using what you think is fun is the best. Many times it's just about limit testing with any gun you like and really learning how to play with a specific weapon or archetype. Take what you think is fun and use it in every scenario until you find it's best areas of engagement and you'll find greater improvement than you think.

Man, I just would settle with doing 950 100K nightfalls but everyone demands Izanagi or Divinity. It sucks and I'm planning to raid for the first time just so I can finally get to do these every weekly reset. :/
---
No. Same plAan
---
Lfg is thriving. I do every raid every week with competent players and its also fun(the people arent assholes like the guy your friend invites) most times
---
The PC LFG discord isn't a clan. It's just a hub for people to find groups for activities.
---
doing nightfall: the ordeal on the highest power level you can go is a pretty effective way of farming exotics, but otherwise you're gonna have to do the exotic weapon quests since there aren't really any other efficient ways to get them. heroic events will drop them very rarely, with emphasis on very.

how are you getting them from patrols?? i wish I was that lucky lmao

Ok thank you for the advicr

Is someone cutting onions in here?

Neither of them banged Mara Sov, so I vote Papa Shaxx.
---
Ok thanks
---
Been seeing this a lot lately IB - not sure what exactly is happening.  Can someone enlighten me?
---
No problem. Hope it works out for you.
---
Lmao I did this earlier with the white Auto Rifle you get just for shits and giggles and was doing literally 9 damage a shot
---
Honestly, while I found it frustrating in IB I didn‚Äôt find it impossible with any of the classes. Stay nearby until 30 seconds remain on it, then camp it furiously, rush in, grab the heavy, and shoot someone with it. Repeat. 
---
It was definitely easiest on my Bubble titan tho.
---
It's a cool looking ghost, just a shame about the useless perks.
---
Oh god I just imagined someone using that combo with one eyed mask

Thank you, my brain must have fallen out of my ears while I was reading that. I see you clearly said that already. üò¨

Bruh, that guy gets Randy‚Äôs throwing knife for free

I had a team with a bubble and a well and they were dedicated to getting it which was nice. Those were the real godberries.

cause when you tea bag on console you use your class ability, they probably would if they could

Nice!! I‚Äôm still trying to get those sweet, sweet Void affinity Steps
---
Nice. I can't decide if I like transversive more or ophidian now for PvP. Just can't decide.
---
Where'd you get these?
---
I also love how the Warlock's look.
---
They're lip balms, not food sadly. I had a Sprite Lip Smacker once and it did smell exactly like sprite and tasted fairly Sprite like too so now I'm wondering if these smell and taste like crayon or if they wussed out and made them fruit flavoured instead.
---
Thanks for the warning my fellow guardian.
---
Eat the titan patch
---
Take my luck \0_0/
---
Just land your shots, you'll 3 tap every guardian with a hand cannon without any unique perks. Oh damage fall off due to range? Just get closer lul. Spare ration / kindled Orchid with kill clip rampage is so much better than not forgotten. Its just a trophy gun lul
---
I'm trying to finish up on my hunter, so I have a chance at a pinnacle chest piece. This is seriously frustrated to the point where I've lost all enjoyment that I had at the beginning of this.
---
\*weapon icon\* final blows, 0/500.  
---
I have a feeling this is for a weapon.
---
i can‚Äôt disagree with hunters being very strong in pvp. but every class can be very strong in pvp. how about built in shotguns for warlocks that have more range than shot guns and don‚Äôt require aim. also if you have a problem with what weapons people use in an rpg don‚Äôt play. people use snipers because getting a pick is an easy way to go and win the team fight. which immediately puts you 3 lives ahead. snipers aren‚Äôt over powered you just don‚Äôt know lanes or have the ability to avoid snipers.
---
Good, maybe Bungie will do something about it. Complaining on this sub doesn't do anything but it does there. Quest needs to be removed, at least the RL and shotgun kills. Trying to get HC and scout kills is almost impossible right now because of this.
---
Izanagis and Eri's Vow are both exotics, and u cant equip 2 at once
---
The heavy step? People are having an issue with it? I got it knocked out with truth in two matches. Although I've been blocking all the people who never post anything but whiny shit, so maybe that's why I haven't seen any posts about it.
---
I'm 99% sure the dude was being sarcastic but didn't get to finish the message (the countdown after the match ended). 
---
It was a great match. They had us 3-0, then we somehow won 4 in a row, for a win. The opposing team did have a 3rd player, but I think he went AFK and got AFK-kicked in the very last round.
---
Please make more

They are basiclly a virus right

The Rocket Launcher step, specifically, yeah.

---
If he became hunter vanguard I don‚Äôt think hunters would even complain
---
For pvp you want a high impact frame shotgun. I played 6ish games and got like 4 shotgun kills before I grabbed my mindbenders from bank. 2 games later and I‚Äôm done.
---
I mean its an ok gun. Its not insane thom people usually pay for recovs for FOMO im pretty sure tho
---
Get a good pulse rifle. "Bygones" you can get from gambit, "go figure"  is a world drop, "right side of wrong" is a energy weapon version of go figure, also world drop.
---
What, as a company? Duh. Sega corporate was always like this.
---
Two titans, one bubble.  The erotic fan fiction no one asked for.
---
I have no issue with dusk rock, it‚Äôs just on there because that‚Äôs the majority of the load-out I see with NF. So mainly just NF, the reason I say it‚Äôs a crutch due to you needing very little recoil control to use it (on console). You just need to point and shoot for it to be effective being (I think) a high reward low effort type weapon. By no means do I think any below average player can shine but definitely an average player can pick it up and instantly be way more effective than using another hand cannon or anything within hand cannon range because of the the very little recoil it has.
---
He's Greek.
---
yea. i hate when i join a game and it already started and the game is 70-10 and then we lose and it gets counted against me for joining seconds before it gets called.
---
Enjoy all the frames!
---
I'm getting both
---
Hunters are innately good in PvP, they're easily the strongest due to ArcStrider Dodge Damage Resist, a plethora of abilities for excellent utility and more so.
---
But in all fairness, HandHeld SuperNova is pretty broke, if you have Contraverse. Otherwise it takes time to Regen, unlike others which can be nearly instant.
---
And that's why I despise people who use Revokers + NF. They pick off weakened players instead of dueling. My "PvP honor" is built off Dark Souls dueling, so I'm probably biased
---
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
The Destiny Companion App on your phone works well if Discord isn‚Äôt.
---
Same here, I'll occasionally master work weapons. Like I masterworked my trust just the other day
---
Yes.  Yes they do, because they are. Two hours for five encounters is not bad how many 980 nf you getting done in two hours? It's realistically not a bad amount of time anyway.
---
Yeah i called it the one shot master lol

Would actually get me to use something other then the Ophiuchus shell. Side note why are 90% of ghost/sparrow perks actually useless?

I completely agree, but I do think it definitely helps the average player with it having very little recoil so it‚Äôs very easy to land consecutive shots

Yknow it had more zoom than a tacsys sight in d1 and tacsys was like a 5x zoom I think the nlb zoom is something like 5.5x or 6x zoom

get the external drive anyways. i also have a 500 and was constantly running up against memory issues and have to choose what to delete. my gf got me a 2 tb external drive and it‚Äôs been great. d1 and d2 are the only things currently stored in the main hard drive, everything else is offline games like skyrim and they are stored on the external drive

Im having an issue with a map piece ive ran ordeal and original nightfalls dozens of times with no completions on the rocket launcher kills and nightfall fragment with the 100 power handicap

Just like Cade6... oh wait

As a hunter I  agree with you completely!

Nope, it's kills.

I just want to turn in IB tokens, not do a fckin' quest with every type of weapon owned.

Beautiful good jobüëç
---
Thanks so much.
