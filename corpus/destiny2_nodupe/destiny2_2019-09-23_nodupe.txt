Lmao this shits so easy you can literally get away with anything and have quick finishes. People are so bad at easy stuff it kills me.
---
---
---
Makes sense
---
Not everyone has the time to do all those exotic quests, so they are probably asking if it‚Äôs worth the time, not whether the actual guns are worth it
---
In Destiny 1 I used the Ward of Dawn and made the mighty mistake of trying to throw a sticky grenade through the bubble.
---

---
It didn't go as planned.
---
I hope they will
---
And then he beats the shit out of a bunch of caballers
---
It‚Äôs not that bad, Forsaken at launch on the other hand was a pain in the ass
---
True but I meant the range of zhalo
---
Yep that little jump boost is part of the reason I don't like playing blades anymore.
---
Go do the menagerie quest
---
\*feigning concern\* who _hurt_ you?
---
THE F'ING TITAN
---
These are the only ones I happened to record ;)
---
That‚Äôs easily abuse able so it won‚Äôt happen
---
what does firing lane do?
---
It won‚Äôt be as bad as you think for power level. The real grind will be armor mods and such
---
To start this game is not a rigorous grind. The grind to light shouldn‚Äôt take more than a month or two. And secondly not having prime engrams won‚Äôt affect you that much with the weekly and daily challenges and also the fact that planetary vendors will now give you drops at you power level not 20 below. So no the game will not become grindyer
---
"This weapon deals increased precision damage when near two or more allies"

Since its a vex themed season on the horizon, itd be amazing to see this bad boy returning in a Mission similar to zero hour

Same boat, have more hours in d2 these past three weeks than all of the rest of 2019

Why are you being so...passive aggressive? And why downvote me? I'm literally just asking for opinions.
---
I made like 15 runs today, got the curated night watch too üòÇ
---
I have the curated roll of every one of those weapons EXCEPT sole survivor.
---
Yeah, I'm stumped honestly, thanks for the help though
---
easily the best GL in the game hands down, doesn't even need spike nades infinite ammo on kill is hella awesome and who can't love explosions
---
You could go for a slam and fall off a party of the map
---
"Ugh... *that* top with *those* shoes?? As if."
---
I got a Go Figure once and I'm not a forsaken owner. I've also gotten an arscenic bite from completing the campaign.
---
Conclusion: Maybe?
---
It's super fun because then my roaming super gets to have fun üåö
---
Why would you delete the file just to have to download it again? It‚Äôs the same file. The disc is just a license key.
---
25 headshot kills in crucible sounds hard. 
---
I'm a PvE player and definitely not good enough to achieve that, especially considering the smaller hitboxes on guardians and the slow fire rate of hand cannons.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt let me download the digital because it said I already had the game installed. The only way I could play is with the disk in unless I uninstalled it and downloaded the digital version.
---
I commented too early. The votes were opposite at the time
---
Damn, the defeat at the end was icing on the cake too
---
It's not tied to a quest anymore, the quest was limited time but now it's just a random world drop.
---
There‚Äôs no quest for thunderlord anymore. It‚Äôs in the exotic loot pool now.
---
"Improsive"
---
I may be a shoulder charging Titan, but at least I can spell.
---
That‚Äôs weird. I have the digital version of D2. But all the disc games I have only installed a small file and then the rest downloaded from the server meaning it‚Äôs the same file. Unless bungie decided to somehow separate them or MS screwed something up.
---
Shutting down bottom tree Striker morons is just too good. That's the only real reason for BB.
---
If the host doesn‚Äôt have forsaken and only has Y1 content, then you won‚Äôt have score.
---
That'll be the problem, thank you!
---
How tanky were sunbreaker in d1?
---
No not all that in fact i mained titan all the way until around Solstice because Bungie pretty much threw them in the trash, and I mained Hunter in D1. Lets just i do not regret making the switchüòâ
---
How does one do this?
---
Vaulted items included
---
I'm a new player and I can say I also get really excited when I get base game loot lol
---
Haha you‚Äôre an idiot
---
I was playing about 4 or five matches with another Titan (I was a Titan too) and we rivaled it super hard always one up'ing each other every match. They finally got on my team and then the other 4 people didn't do squat and we lost instantly.
---
It's used incorrectly so often, the "you're" version will probably be changed to "your".
---
It has highest chance to drop from the weekly Dreaming City mission from Petra
---
Yes you should be able to buy just shadowkeep.

This is the guy that got trashed on
---
Basically any weapon that you‚Äôre good with

If you want to match up the aesthetic, the use one of the four seraph weapons
---
Amazing art!
---
I've been wondering if guardians are more of a tool to ghosts than ghosts are to guardians. Ghosts give me a "would you kindly" bioshock feel.
---
Thank you for sharing your knowledge with me and I agree with your opinion on proper expansions for them respectively :D
---
From my understanding (and I could be wrong,) there will not be power levels (like 50 is cap now) but just light levels. Everyone is base 750 and with the expansions and passes, can raise thier light into a soft cap in the 900's (?). So, without the DLCs, I'm not sure how much above 750 you will make it, if at all.
---
Yeah i thought the same, but as far as i know u can ignore and "disobey" ur ghost without any bad things happening, but in the end Guardians are tools of the light
---
That‚Äôs some funny stuff there. Thx for the good laugh. I needed it.
---
I didn‚Äôt blame gearbox for what the internet did to their characters you mong. I blamed their fucking CEO, Randy Pitchford for assaulting an employee, not paying said employee, and leaving porn and sensitive game files lying around in a random restaurant. Yes, Bungie fucked over Martin O Donnell, but there was a large amount of he said/she said, so we don‚Äôt know whos at fault. Nathan fillion not coming back was likely due to the fact that they were scrimping and saving in order to buy the fucking IP back from Activision, something people have been asking for since before D1 launched.
---
P.S Randy Pitchford was watching ‚Äúbarely legal‚Äù porn, not porn of the characters from Borderlands. The barely legal part of that isnt an inference on my behalf, it‚Äôs a quote from him.

1 stray knife can do a 90 around a corner to kill its target.
---
Yet somehow 6 knives at point blank range doesn't kill the caster?
---
   
---
This is why I still play D2, for those illogical moments!  :D
---
You right
---
You dont need the frequency from resonate stems for the Nascent Dawn nodes. If you're up to that step its ready to open.  
---
The one you're looking for is on the cliffside where you first spawn into Mars (not near a fast travel point) - at the end of Olympus Descent
---
Tanky is the wrong term. There was an exploit where you could throw 3x more hammers in one super. It was broken as fuck. It somehow worked by using grenades, but canceling then into a hammer throw.
---
Thanks!

Some of them.

And I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a welcomed change. I‚Äôm too sick and tired of having to use grenade launchers for everything.

I occasionally use blink anyway so I‚Äôll try to give it a bit of focus for a while and see if matters improve. Thanks man, genuine appreciation here for the advice.

Icarus grip increases your in air accuracy and that would be the reason then, in air accuracy is horrible without an icarus grip so your simply getting bad rng with where the slug goes.
---
What‚Äôs the lowest you‚Äôd recommend going without compromising the integrity.  I want this to be study enough to handle itself if something were to happen.
---
Wow, thank you so much! How do I go about getting one? Just from the gunsmith?
---
Gunsmith is the main source yes, you may also have weapons with the mod on it that you could dismantle.
---
Also, does it make a difference if the mod is on the weapon itself or just my character?
---
Has to be on the weapon.

More serisously are you on ps4 ?

I just assumed it stood for the light in general

My friend and I just managed to put an end to Dul Incaru. We just kept moving a lot and trying to communicate with each other on strategies and reviving and ammo, things like that. We needed to drop all knights twice so it was kinda long but very worth it. I was just expecting that something special would drop after beating the Boss but nothing happened, actually. Is it normal?
---
In always pumped for exotic engrams for a chance to get enhanced perks. But with armor 2.0 coming up even that is going away
---
And I was already replied to about the location and all that, I'm good
---
No obviously not. And you bland use of hyperbole is unnecessary. It‚Äôs the one hit kill for little to no skill input nature of it that frustrates me no end.
---
Depends. If your job demands heavy time, that is not being happy.  And most job that requires high education demands time.

I was looking on steam and the Destiny 2 Shadowkeep Digital Deluxe Edition $60 comes with 4 seasons. Does that mean it comes with the previous dlcs?
---
No.   The digital deluxe for Shadowkeep is for the dlc and then the next 4 seasons.   You have to purchase forsaken separately and as of last week I believe they were giving the year 2 expansion pass to all forsaken owners who didn‚Äôt have it.
---
Hunter grenades are made to track ennemies when they‚Äôre fleeing. The solar swarm thing nade, the scanner nade. They‚Äôre weak but if your ennemy hides behing cover, you can get him.

He gets shot from behind the cover due to latency, a side effect of p2p connection, happens all the time in crucible.
---
Its over for me :( i give my best but i cant do this this game is not for me. In one month i have played over 150h which is a lot. At start game was awesome then some steps of quest was pvp and i hit a wall. 
---
Like i said before i havent played FPS at ps4 i played only darks souls, bloodborne, sekiro and god of war which i enjoyed a lot. 
---
So i decided to quit destiny 2 for now maybe later i will go back and tried again. But for now i have finish. 
---
Thanks all for great advices and everything.
---
My guess is that it will be a reinstalled.  Each platform has different coding, so at a minimum there will be an update, but my guess is it will be a new install for a cleaner file.
---
Console with no key required will be able to pre down load Sept 29.  I do not know if that will apply to PC also, but one can hope. I have a 10Mb/s service so actually get about 8Mb/s if my husband and I are not both downloading, so the 165 GB file will take about 50-75 hrs for me.
---
Don't lie cammy i know you did this
---
Judging from the fact that the [product page](https://bungiestore.com/collections/whats-new/products/preorder-bungie-rewards-destiny-2-forsaken-crown-of-sorrow-raid-jacket) says shipping "Q3 2019" and "**Be prepared to wait 3-4¬†months for your order to ship**.", my guess is here in the next week.
---
Lol that man is on another level
---
What‚Äôs collector armor?
---
Pretty sure you need to reacquire the set to be have 2.0 armor once shadowkeep drops. One of my favorite titan sets as well
---
Yeah, I was referring to Iron Banner. There are a bit less tryhards in quick-play so the situation is not that bad there.
---
The gambit prime collector armor, allows you to collect 20 motes at a time and gives numerous bonuses for anybody getting motes
---
"WE'LL TEAR DOWN THEIR COMMAND ONE BY ONE, GUARDIAN. Start with Valus Ta'aurc..."
---
Yo we killed all of their kell
---
I think you commented on the wrong post lol
---
I mean I see the complaints about iron banner as it is meant to be naturally competitive in comparison to quickplay. I understand them, and I wouldn't hate it if their was some form of SBMM for iron banner.
---
I'll give you the weapons, they were better in D1. But the armors have been pretty good.
---
But I still think they're better overall than D1.
---
I agree! I have been playing Iron Banner and Saladin is to quiet. I love the enthusiasm Shaxx has, it gets you going!
---
Fair enough.. Also could be easier farming since there is influx of newer crucible players which are easier to beat.
---
I do this with Shadowshot at least 50% of the time
---
Bows are a fun change of pace.
---
Both. We will do litteraly anything to gain power (gambit and reckoning represents that well) like the dredgens do. But I think it all comes down to what we do with it. 
---
For example, I chose to side with the drifter not because I want to be a bad guy, but he is not really that bad intentioned. Yes he‚Äôll do anything to reach his goal, but this goal isn‚Äôt evil. It‚Äôs literally fixing the weakness of guardians. 
---
Plus, us being there, supporting him, means we can also keep him in check. If his plans succeed, that‚Äôd be a great deal, and if shit hits the fan, we‚Äôre there to prevent it. Also because of it we go do dirty work instead of others that could potentially be victims of collateral damage (Gambit Prime test had 3 guardians die for good).
---
In the end, did we avenge Cayde because loot? We only need this power because of the bigger threats.
---
Don‚Äôt you dare mock Mara the snack.
---
The steam file validation system works so well because it's strict as fuck.
---
Take an install of GTAV. Fresh. (About 90GB) 
---
Ok, uninstall steam. Leave the installed games, clean out the rest. (GTAV files remain untouched.)
---
Reinstall steam. Ok and now watch it FAIL over half the files in the GTAV folder and restart the download. (Every single time.)
---
Be ready to redownload D2 folks.
---
If you only buy the Rise of Iron expansion you are most likely mentally challenged. In the current pricing you are favoring, the complete collection of Destiny 1 is $30 in most stores........includes rise of iron......
---
You dare mock the queen?
---
Thanks boss
---
I got it on my second
---
That's illegal
---
mhm! He'll need forsaken to level up anyways
---
I ended up sitting on rampage spec mods for weeks before I started on breakneck. I had no idea how well they worked together and had figured I'd never use it. Big mistake.
---
That gun is a workhorse, love it when I'm bored of blast Furnace
---
On strong curse weeks instead of a chest the machine across from where you make the offering opens up, the chest is inside there
---
With those the titans have the same lunge as hunters; thats bad because hunters have a lunge range of like 5meters
---
Well I never even did scourge tell season of the drifter so it evens out
---
You are relating unrelated things smh
---
Exactly my point I don't need the whole collection just rise
---
I know this isn‚Äôt as bad as most people here but I haven‚Äôt gotten Anarchy yet. I got 1,000 voices on my 3rd Last Wish cleat and Tarrabah on my 3rd clear of Crown of Sorrow. I am on my 8th clear of Scourge of the past.....
---
I love these reminders to never play competitive in D2. Just give me that sweet sweet PvE DLC.
---
Why would you try to grind this in comp lol
---
Eye of the storm GREATLY increases handling, on that 3rd shot in a dual it makes it pretty impossible to miss. Gives everything snapshot would give but better. Snapshot rangefinder is also a good option though.
---
Imperial and Dust rock you can have snapshot for better handling if you're using rifled and it definitely doesn't hurt. But I strongly Disagree, rampage makes a world of difference in crucible. If you're taking a shot at a second player immediately after getting a kill it's unlikely you get to proc slideshot, so rampage fills that gap and gives you the extra killing power. That's a preference thing. Especially if you run handling exotics.
---
Backup plan is still the best way to go on an erentil for crucible unless you're planning to be running around with that the entire game. A backup plan under pressure role has plenty of range for the purpose of the role. It's a backup plan, you have a primary to dual with and a fusion with a crazy fast ttk to use if you get pushed.
---
Waking vigil is still a solid option even with the ricochet nerf, it's one of the better energy hc's for crucible and still should be after but I expect kindled to become more prevalent. But yes I would say it's not worth investing a ton of time in.
---
Trust in crucible is really a nah. Not on pc. 180s just don't have a place, that's why I recommended the pve roll.
---
The reason you want box breathing and opening shot on a twilight oath is for max bullet mag. It makes the sniper incredibly sticky. And assuming you don't have the snapshot role then opening shot and box is really the next best thing.
---
In my opinion, the mini tool SMG from menagerie is still pretty awesome to use if you have feeding frenzy on it
---
Legendary weapons are at the mercy of rng because of random rolls. So someone with good luck can get a god rolled spare rations and mop the floor with someone who can‚Äôt get a decent roll. Obviously I‚Äôm exaggerating but that‚Äôs the idea. Exotics are static so everyone‚Äôs essentially on the same playing field. I know that getting exotics requires some rng but the chances of getting jotunn, for example, are MILES above the chances of getting a perfect rolled spare rations or bygones
---
That‚Äôs just silly
---
he is the best guardian
---
I personally rock the hard packed snowman shell from last years dawning
---
I recommend the vow if you have it, or arsenic bite. It's not worth using an exotic slot for it. I did my grind with mountaintop, the vow, and 1k voices. Was still able to win plenty of games and got my bow kills and medals done while doing it. Don't really like the crazy slow draw times of bows without archer's tempo and the exotic ones are some of the longest.
---
so if *you're* his favorite and *I'm* also his favorite and that other guy is his favorite too...logically we must all fight to the death.
---
V e r y   N i c e
---
Which is achieved to a better effect with arcstrider and liars handshake, hell you don't even need the exotic to start oneshotting shit. Like I said, the buffs in pve are greatly needed.

I thought I was the only one who licked the wall

Ah m8 i was so frustrating yesterday that i delete everything :(. I have played 5h pvp quickplay/competive and in that time i died so many times that i almost broke joystick. I dont get it i shot someone i head and he didnt lose any hp and he oneshot me. Some times i didnt even seen who kill me. But ock i need break from this game, maybe i will return in month or two. 
---
But most anoying thing for me that all my friends are pro players with 1000h of play and i cant play with them. I can only run and follow them. Its anoying when you dont have someone in my rang and skill to play with.
---
I believe sliding increases ur speed initially, but you slow down at the end, so total distance remains the same. It couldve saved u, but we can never be sure.
---
Considering shield will be nerfed by roaming super nerfs I think it‚Äôll balance out
---
Then you should think about changing your provider or upgrade to a better connection.
---
If you ruin the play experience for others, I guess Bungie chose the better way to restrict you. 
---
This restriction is partly a punishment and partly a chance to improve your connection. Everyone wants a great game experience.
---
My thunder crash tends to disagree
---
I don't know about the motivational part for the drifter. "This team is doing great. Your team is doing **TERRIBLE**! ^(just kidding...)"
---
I think you can do it. I give you a hint. You can just use the help of team [https://legionfarm.com/d2/bundles](https://legionfarm.com/d2/bundles) and Destiny 2 boost of the team will help you to get high-level personage so you will be able to enjoy playing without wasting too much time for the game. It\`s would be a good decision in your situation.
---
I get what you're saying but also kicking me out for no reason from a lobby isn't my fault even when my connection is great
---
D1 player since the Alpha. I took a long break after D2 Y1. I came back 2 months ago, grinded the Solstice armor and was blown away by how much content there was. I was completely overwhelmed. It was amazing to have soo much to do. I was a bit bummed I couldn't get many triumphs done but that's ok that's my fault. 
---
Now I am pre-ordered and can't wait to jump into all the content and grind out this new DLC and season. Playing Foresaken has rekindled the fire I originally had with Destiny I look forward to where Bungie takes us.
---

It was last week I think that I started to get spare rations. Didn't even know what I had till my friend freaked out. Actually it was during the Mars event. Managed to get 5 one is a keeper.  Ty for the information it will come in handy for farming it cause I need one with opening shot.

Never feel bad for the striker titan having his dome popped.
---
I did this when iOS 13 was released. Amazing how far we've come in technology.
---
Works overall fairly well, but I did feel some lag using the controller.  Still infinitely better than using the on-screen controls. Small screen also makes playing hard.
---
I think for strikes it's not bad, but for PvP, the small lag in the DS4 controller will make it hard to do well in PvP.  I'll have to test it again though.

Is it possible to learn such power?
