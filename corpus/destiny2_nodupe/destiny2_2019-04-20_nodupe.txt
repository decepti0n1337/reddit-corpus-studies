Xhouseofwolvesx add me I‚Äôm always down to play d1 story again
---
---
---
I'm on mobile so I couldn't explain everything I wanted. But just message me if you have any doubts. There is also some subreddits that can be accessed on the right side which have people discussing crucible tips, builds and other stuff and I suggest you maybe browse it
---
We are on reddit. How mature is the average redditer.
---
is that beta riven in development or just a really bad glitch
---
since when is 120? when i googled how much it was per reset it said that it was something like 60 when you are at heroic
---
Beta Riven
---
No one knows about the No Feelings.
---

---
Box Breathing, Rapid Hit, Meyrin RDL, Range MW.
---
Can 3 tap a guardian at any range with 3 crits + Box Breathing, gives it the same TTK as Luna's/Not Forgotten. Absolutely underrated and a monster in both PvE and PvP.
---
After you unlock the service revolver from Zavala then you have a chance to obtain turning in vanguards with random rolls. Depending on the roll, it can keep up/out perform Luna‚Äôs howl
---
You‚Äôve never seen a wayfarer?? Their everywhere
---
admit it, it could have been so much better, Breakneck had a secret perk built into Onslaught, why couldn't Oxygen at the least have some sort of Triple Tap built in?
---
Looks like an iced Starbucks matcha latte coming from an ex barista
---
Wait, Breakneck has a secret perk? I just got it like, yesterday.
---
the higher the Rampage stack the faster the reload
---
F
---
never
---
not my favorite...but remembering the first time hearing the Sepiks music in the beta makes it really hard not to love it the most.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
fav would probably be Echo Chamber for the Eyasluna farm.
---
That sub is so hot right now
---
best part is you just need a single kill to load two into the chamber. (as long as you have the ammo in reserves)
---
More mature than you.
---
I...did not know this, but it means it‚Äôs now going to be my go-to kinetic primary. Still gonna use Oxygen as my secondary if I‚Äôm running special kinetic. Dragonfly spec and meganeura are just so...crispy
---
MiDA used to wreck shit in PVP. i miss those days.
---
Need eveny singel one i can get
---
In crucible it's not that important unless your team drags only by a small margin in which case yes, you are contributing to that gap. Though if you have 10 deaths in total and your team is 10 points behind it doesn't mean your contribution to that is 100%, it's rather \~50% because your teammates die as well (and it's not like it's possible to reduce 10 deaths to zero). The crucible is as much about not dying to enemy team as it is about killing it. If you play safe you are already doing some good, especially if you land assists.
---
Killed by the Architects
---
It's purely location based. We have no data to prove that there is or isn't lobby balancing either.
---
Bungie is not that hot
---
An improvement then most teams I get put in for comp.
---
make it a permanent mode and that every 3 branches gives you 1  enhancement core with bosses giving you 2 each
---
Did u forget what Yugi done with Kuribo
---
RiskRunner Soul build
---
RiskRunner+Getaway Artist=You are gonna have a bad time.
---
What about the titans with suppressor grenade spam? Thats annoying af.
---
Can confirm (at least back in the day). I got the catalyst and worked to MW it during the later days of Warmind, and my word. It was tricky to do right but when you got the hang of it it just felt so good. Ultra-long range encounters were the love of your life.
---
Gravity kills more guardians then anything else.
---
You've not covered the name AT ALL.
---
Not really. You can easily get all the lore.
---
I‚Äôm there except for Truth to Power, 4 friggin pages away!
---
3 games per week
---
You can‚Äôt just get another from Eva?
---
Haven't messed with it yet,  couldn't tell ya
---
A rarity in a sea of salt.
---
Agreed. It takes team coordination. People can‚Äôt assume you jive after one shot.
---
514 glory to go then. I had gain 1466 as a solo player. It has been a nightmare lol
---
Argh! It hurts watching this. Why would you do this?üòñ
---
I appreciate it man! Just did speed runs with my buddy and got Rat King catalyst. He‚Äôs still dry, but they exist!
---
Good work.
---
THEY SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE
---
BUT THEY WERE WRONG
---
That I understand but today is prism brawler which is great for supers like Thundercrash sentinel and Arcstrider ( which I was using cause the damage bug isn't patched yet)
---
Gogoo! You can do ittt!!
---
Pffft not this week. Or next. Lol.
---
The second caption should read "unskilled spectral blades users." 
---
But I'm a Titan, so I don't care üòÇ
---
I hav a full auto zen moment distant relation and its pretty much vision of confluence
---
Shit, I have that title and if I'm the top 5-10%, it sure doesn't feel like it.
---
Also known as "probably but no"
---
219 is a straight scam for Recluse, it's easier than ever (ignoring the Revelry bullshit) to get the pinnacle weapons. I don't do recovs or anything, but this shit should cost sub 50 for how easy it is for a half decent player
---
I read somewhere that bungie are considering to nerf it?
---
I got mine with the flipping ability and reload when you hop on.
---
who that‚Äôs really cool! I‚Äôm not into death but i got a few friends that are
---
She was an upside-down hive knight at one point
---
Well not so much surprising I suppose. Just kinda weird to think actually how long they work on these things.
---
i was doing the same thing
---
Congrats. One day I may be as lucky. I will keep trying though
---
It's funny how you reddit hiveminds don't realize that the spectral super wasn't even that OP compared to dawnblade and stuff it's the wallhacks that make the class op
---
No.
---
I doubt that would ever happen or be permanent due to backlash from those who earned them. I also haven't seen that anywhere unless you have a source.
---
Got rezzed by its ghost and its the best its ever been.
---
&lt;3
---
Yeah mida isn‚Äôt really a long range scout, if i want a long range scout i either switch to Polaris or jade rabbit.
---
Dang, im ps4. You'll get it tho man!
---
That totally seems familiar to me: https://youtu.be/SLh_TOsF4Wo
---
If I recall correctly it's a Spectral Blade way of the wraith post and yes it's already posted here.
---
Gold is a really soft metal and I presume our Armor and weapons are really heavy the only reason we can maneuver with them is because of our light powers so it's not hard to believe we put footprints in gold
---
Today until reset tomorrow
---
Got to 67 my first run, haven't been able to crack 25 since
---
Got to 150 with randoms but stopped due to hunger and urination
---
How much time did you have to defeat the Bosses?
---
People have posted vids of them getting exotic drops from it (queenbreaker, I recall, was one. But there were more), so you never know. I did mine yesterday without even trying. I was just playing the strike playlist normally and it completed üëç
---
So I guess what I‚Äôm saying is that just have it in your inventory and it might complete. If you‚Äôre a strike player, that is.
---
Not many use kbm and there is no way to tell if they do. And the grenade spam will end by the time revelry goes away. So sure luna/nf are pretty trouble some especially for average players. But do realise some people eorked their ass off to get it too. In the end crucible will never be balanced simply because there will always be a certain meta and their will always be people complaining about it.
---
Yeah that can be a bit of a pain nobody uses roaming supers much.
---
With the insanely shitty RNG this game has I‚Äôm surprised anyone has Wayfarer.
---
Ive farmed all milestones and bounties. I completed raids and farmed nightfalls. Still no oem or ursa. Just because rng loves you that doesnt mean its the same for everyone else.
---
Sadly Queenbreaker is absolutely not worth your exotic slot anymore :(
---
Collection exists
---
Don‚Äôt hurt me like that :((((
---
I would agree if it wasnt for the grenade chucking fest it is right now, lol
---
Wait there‚Äôs a raid in Penumbra? I thought it said a 6 player activity with matchmaking and stuff
---
I want a toaster and a dragon's head ornament
---
space turtle 'til I die
---
If the Uriels Gift is still available for purchase I'd love to talk about buying it
---
maybe I counted wrong and the medal I saw wasn't army for one. I could have sworn that was four though since I waited until their invasion portal wasn't active
---
&gt;i need to win a gambit match with only gambit weapons equipped.
---
You can get this by changing your weapons right before your final primeval dies just so you know, you don't have to play the whole match with shit weapons :p
---
It's both, Penumbra is gonna be bigger than these 2 I think
---
Yay! Congrats :D
---
Thank you! I‚Äôm amazed at how difficult they made the quests for this, but I‚Äôm so happy to have it!
---
This happened with me but I was at 2050. So tempting to play one more game
---
They gotta keep you somehow ;) but yeah, quests are difficult and the grind is so real but it feels worth it I promise :3
---
Pocket infinity was the only exotic i think to not get into taken king :(
---
In order to get the reckoner title you have to play poorly. It is the most ass backwards title of all time. It punishes good game play at every turn. Literally the only thing that it rewards is playing the game A LOT.
---
‚ô°
---
250 on my third run, never went back because I got bored of it
---
Lmao someone must really suck if they‚Äôre willing to pay 200+ dollars for a virtual weapon in a game that can be obtained just by practicing and playing well
---
Lol it works with the jotun.  So many people used it on me before,  now I have (got it like 4 days ago)  and have just seen my rank rise.  Unless a damn teammate drops out for no damn reason lolol
---
No u x2
---
After this I took a closer look...its so...wrong
---
I found it there. Not as a template, just that image is already a r/waterniggas meme
---
I feel bad,  I got mine on my first or 2nd.
---
HE DESERVES WORSE
---
You got normal loot but ok
---
Distant Relations gave me the idea for this meme. I really really wish there were more SRs like it
---
Ah. I assumed we pulverized a commander?
---
I was all set to drop the /r/ATBGE for this, but........I dig it.  This is pretty rad.
---
Lmao
---
Well written
---
 What are we looking at here?!?
---
Ether Doctor master race.
---
This is not working as good as it sounds, really..
---
Real talk, the change in sights is a huge deal, I despise the standard ones and this skin makes a huge difference. Also it looks fantastic.
---
Not all hero's wear capes
---
Dude it‚Äôs a god
---
Against taken/gambit invaders that gun shreds
---
Took me about 6 hours when it came out.
---
I get the sentiment that if you have enough motes go bank. However in practice it isn't that simple. When you have 6 dregs surrounding you, you're not paying attention to your mote count. If you have the last couple of motes to bank but you're surrounded and your team is waiting at the bank, you're not going to prioritize banking. Some people are just bad at gambit, but that doesn't mean everyone who doesn't bank perfectly is.
---
wait, does that mean commander zavala spanish in origin
---
Nowhere near as OP though.
---
Thx! That‚Äôs doable.
---
but a good one
---
True. Nor as aesthetically pleasing.
---
What did you use to change the headlight color? HoK Candy?
---
I love it, the feel the look. It's really good one of the best IMO
---
The gift of the nine shader is pretty dope on titans. The preview card does not do it justice, the blue is way better once applied.
---
I'm so jelly. I've been thinking about wrapping my.eclipse, how much did it cost you to do this
---
Good for reckoning, that's about it lol
---
Famous last words
---
I did the same thing, It's funny but I feel like I got killed cuz I wasn't shooting back and just spamming grenades.
---
Wormhusk is what I was using the good thing about the top tree is you vanish so all the tracking grenades dont follow you. If you spam it to much roughly 10 times in a row you wont be invisible anymore so fair warning.
---
It‚Äôs a beast in PvE but very very situational in PvP. If there was another way to activate its perk besides punching twice, this would be good in PvP but as far as it stands, you‚Äôre most likely going to get shotgunned or shoulder charged before you can even get a 2nd melee off.
---
That‚Äôs the point is overcoming those situational moments w/ moment that outplay those moments.
---
nah he's just salty because he wishes he could be that good.
---
Could you possible make the hammer just a little bit cheaper and I think I could actually afford it haha
---
Are you open to commissions? I have a 2011 Chevy Malibu LT that I would love a custom wrapping on.
---
heh, 4 skipnades can be dealt with. 4 handheld supernovas on the other hand... that one is pure salt
---
I played with and against them last night on PC in Crucible and Gambit Prime.
---
The production is still quality,  they dropped the ball on the shallow story, lack of customization, and  childish writing though.   Not as good as d1,  not even close but still a pretty good game.
---
I‚Äôd get 3rd degree spooked if I saw that after the strike
---
Look, I play a lot of PvP and I can see how these would be fun and some what viable in quickplay, but if you‚Äôre playing against good players especially high level comp, chances are you‚Äôre going to be dead meat within the first shot gun shot. I mean if you‚Äôve figured out a way to some how by pass that, then by all means keep on using them but other exotics in PvP that provide a better neutral game at all times during the match are probably better like stomp33s and dragon shadow and sixth coyote.
---
Thanks, I took my time on that one its one of my favorites.
---
Uriels gift and bolt caster but everything is still available for now.  But i can still print the ones that sold if your interested.
---
I dont see why you would go beyond 20 tbh.
---
Valid statement that both of those choices are more viable and befit you with no risk, and there‚Äôs no real way of me ever perfecting the use of it. But the more I use it, the more I find myself outplaying those high elo players in comp. I also just like the risk that‚Äôs included with it, for the reward you need to play close. But once you get that pick it‚Äôs time.
---
Its sold but if your interested i can print one for you.
---
Just to see how far we could get, you can easily take all bosses out at 30
---
u/Cynaren is right, it is the pillager. I like to run smg/bow for PVE.
---
You can view it in-game if you go talk to Eva Levante. The first time you talk to her she will give you a tonic. Then you have to follow what your milestone says (to view milestones, open the director and hold the button listed in the top left corner, which is E on PC). Once you've done that, talk to Eva again and hover over the exotic to view what it requires you to do.
---
Kills on Mars, my dude
---
I found out it isn't just Baken. I did a strike with this dude within the past few days and it was someone with only one gold medal.
---
I got it done in 1 game so you should be fine
---
I always thought it be cool if there was a exsotic armor that gave the ability to run two exsotic wepons instead of getting a exsotic armor perk
---
Ready the invitation. Kill things on IO
---
Time worn spire
---
Yeah. Gotta be on the planet it states. It doesn‚Äôt have any cabal by default but if you get lucky and the daily is an ikora mission on io (the first one on io) you can kill some cabal or just wait for public events. No cabal lost sector.
---
*"Collect metaphysical samples from defeated combatants* ***on IO."***
---
Any shader?
---
Revelry event
---
Ha! Now, lets talk Bigfoot. Myth or no?
---
lol this reminded me of destiny the second I saw it and I didn‚Äôt even see which subreddit it was from 
---
looks like dawning hope shader to me
---
It is better for me and my playstyle. Your not going to change my mind on that one.
---
Good luck. Do that and you should have that within a couple weeks. I got my first 1 on my 3rd character.
---
Correct, but jump&gt;slash moves you faster than anything else afaik, which is how people cross the map for 2+ spawn wipes
---
Lmao glitch? No. Read.
---
Any perks I should keep an eye out for?
---
Anyways who needs either when there's spam tinctures for the next 3 weeks.
---
Snapshot and probably outlaw
---
Maybe titans but besides that you right
---
It‚Äôs not difficult just bring a hand cannon and headshot a lot of shit
---
ah, thank you
---
I am the Vanguard.
---
If I remember correctly, Sedia knew Zavala before he being a guardian and said he hasn‚Äôt changed much. My memory might not be right tho.
---
Rated M is usually better content wise. 
---
And I personally want to see Mara topless.
---
Agreed, and Crest of Alpha Lupi increase barrier deployment speed.
---
My only *real* problem with supernova is that it gives you damage resistance, why?
---
Also I hate the revelry tonics in the first place I never signed up to play mayhem in quickplay/comp
---
That was unnecessarily hostile. And I still disagree. While Taken King‚Äôs campaign was good, it was basic. Oryx shows up, wrecks shit, we stop him and save the day. Forsaken had so many more twists and turns, a much deeper story. We lost a character that was important to us in a way that felt impactful. Mara‚Äôs death in Taken King wasn‚Äôt nearly the motivator that Cayde‚Äôs was. The Dreaming City feels like a true changing endgame destination. The Dreadnaught, as much as I liked it, didn‚Äôt feel that way. In addition to that, Forsaken came with an additional location.
---
Comparing vanilla D1 and vanilla D2 is strange. D1 had a much better feeling of power and a better raid, but the story was a mess. D2 had a coherent, dare I say decent story, but neutered our Guardian‚Äôs power. But power isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs being argued here. Your reply mentioned story specifically, and I‚Äôd question the sanity of anyone that thinks the vanilla D1 story was better than D2‚Äôs.
---
Vanilla Destiny 2‚Äôs writing was horrendous, I will admit that. Vanilla Destiny 1‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt great either, but not as bad. Both Forsaken and Taken King‚Äôs writing is great.
---
Moving on to the lore. Have you been reading the recent lore? The quality hasn‚Äôt dipped, if anything, it‚Äôs gotten better. The stories about the origins of the Awoken, the Drifter, the Nine, Calus and his Shadows, the MASSIVE twist in the story of Shin Malphur. Destiny 2 has had fantastic lore, as has Destiny 1. It‚Äôs okay to admit both are good. But saying that Destiny 1‚Äôs is leagues better is more than a bit of a stretch. Having a preference is fine, but refusing to see what Destiny 2 has done right is being overly biased.
---
I would say look for one with perks like field prep, rapid hit, or triple tap.
---
I haven‚Äôt played in a while, what hand cannon is that?
---
It is sprint, then jump, then instantly shoot, than jump again. All very quickly. Thanks!
---
Honestly after a stressful week, Trials was something I could always depend on being there for a good time
---
I did this the first day it came out works great with wormhusk and Lord o wolves. I slayed.
---
This is awesome! What do you mean by wood art though? Painting wood or something else?
---
I just want it to get darker if you know what I mean. Not that I‚Äôm saying it should just be cussing involved.
---
Queue the losing streak
---
He's using Trust, I think
---
Wholeheartedly agree
---
I didn't even consider this
---
It would be a better game. Trust.
---
Not trolling here, I swear I have had 2 meatball bossed since I wrote this post
---
Looks like u playing bots lol
---
It's cut plywood painted with acrylics. Every different color is an individual piece of wood.
---
Don't group up.
---
They already said they won‚Äôt /: you‚Äôll have to wait 2 more weeks
---
What ship is that?
---
love the dance at the end
---
Chaperone is a pretty good sniper.
---
what system do u have it on ?
---
