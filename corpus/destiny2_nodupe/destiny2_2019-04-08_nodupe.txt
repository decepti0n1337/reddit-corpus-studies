I get that, but honestly it feels a lot more fair with blackout and the rest, my opinion obviously but I was breezing though Reckoning tier 3 with blackout but couldn't win once with prism 
---
---
---
I like the digital art Pooh panels, nice fresh touch 
---
Dude you're gonna have to make some kind of official event on a calendar app or something and really blow it up--I guarantee a good group of Guardians will go for it!
---
LOL, "Surprise mother fucker!"
---
Ah yes, Fisto, my favourite in the Protectron line! 
---
Theres no knights in this encounter?
---
Its good but not a god roll...
---

---
Rifled barrel or full choke + accurized rounds + snapshot sights + rambage (when proced rambage increases your range not just damage) and range masterwork... Those are the perks to look for in any shotty slideshot is also good
---
You should go for reckoner
---
Have some on pc from when the base game was free.  Didn‚Äôt play again til Forsaken on pc so I still have them
---
Crap my bad.. 3am here lol... I still use tether in this encounter with darci
---
I‚Äôve had this happen, where we won then after the game ended they got 2 kills then somehow actually won. Rip my streak. 
---
Looks great, how'd you make it 
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/sTZ1Ihm I made one transparent too!
---
Any oh his bounties that states you get a legendary drop from.. 
---
I really dig it! Might have to steal it for my void hunter! (Solar has Trials Cloak and I cannot unequip it.)
---
Just go play Rocket League for an hour. Not every moment of your gaming life has to be spent on Destiny 2. Although, that seems to be the idea for everyone still playing.
---
Nah its normal.. You get 3 or 4 days of exotics rqin.. Then 2 to 3 months of dry season
---
You frickin fricks, when will you learn? When will you learn? Your actions have consequences! 
---
Did you solo or have a team?
---
Half solo half with a group
---
*why*
---
Who really cares? 
---
I got it from the Ives quest in Russia 
---
I agree.  This was the turning point for Destiny 2 that we as a community waited so long for.  
---
August 28th was the first time I've ever enjoyed PvP in Destiny 2.  I was excited knowing that for the first time in the Destiny franchise, snipers and shotguns could exist in the kinetic slot.  That hasn't happened since we had NLB and Universal Remote in Destiny 1.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Really like prime sidearms, hits hard.
---
There is actually a ledge you can jump on the left side that you can use to help cross without super. Also let‚Äôs it be done by any class that way. 
---
First, why do you care? You didn't have to pay for it did you? Second, what are you reporting? That someone wastes their real money on a game?
---
PC people are left out I guess 
---
What is wrong with playing defensively if you are ahead? You force your opponent to make the first move and leave them open to counters, that's a perfectly reasonable and acceptable tactic. 
---
You don't just abandon objectives when you have to defend them do you? Well in clash your life *is* the objective.
---
This made me chuckle XD
---
It already has it's reward - a chance at the Curated Sole Survivor sniper rifle.
---
Plus this is a terrible idea. The whole objective is to summon first, this gives you more time to slay Envoys and develop higher stacks. If you've got your Primeval first the other team are granted infinite Invades in 30second intervals to try halt your progress - if their unlimited attempts at wiping the team with non Power/Super actually wiped stacks it would defeat the point of getting your Primeval first as there'd be payoff for it. You'd actively just be lending a chance to the other team.
---
 The whole idea is that the quicker the summon the more time and stacks you develop and the quicker you kill your Primeval - not the quicker you summon the easier it is for the opposition to impede upon your DPS
---
I dismantled my curated blast furnace because headhunter kinda doodoo 
---
You probably use Monarque so no saving you at this point. No need to call him a scrub, after all he‚Äôs probably better. Also, using good items is not being ‚Äúsweaty‚Äù
---
And without heavy
---
It's the same with normal items. You need luck to get a drop, then luck for it to be either a weapon or armor and then luck to have the specific roll you want to have and then, luck for the right masterwork.
---
I forgot the exact number but the chance to actually get what you want was less then 0,001%, or something like that
---
WITH THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP
---
Yeah,  I think jankybeam's point, though riddled with frustration, is relevant. I recently saw an article that described the crucible as "gladiatorial" and that feels spot-on. One has to continuously put forth effort to stay viable in that setting.  Keep trying!!
---
meh 
---
Its a terrible system but theres more important issues to be addressed, like the state of crucible
---
My bad, didn‚Äôt remember which came first
---
r/sharditkeepit
---
r/sharditkeepit for all your rolls questions
---
head seeker has been proven useless, shard it unless you don‚Äôt have another feeding frenzy roll 
---
It's like Nova Warp all over again in PvP, but hunters instead of Warlocks
---
You should be able to collect the quest from shaxx on all characters
---
It‚Äôs honestly just a sniper gated behind a charge time, no reason it should be heavy
---
Yeah it doesn‚Äôt matter what character you get to Legend Ranking on. You do need to get the 500 Luna Kills on the character that has the quest step though
---
Edz isn‚Äôt America, it‚Äôs a European zone, so soccer should be true 
---
They want cores to be an impactful decision,  yeah. I sure do love scrapping guns or armor and infusing them into my already decent one and already being behind because I just got another better
---
Earlier today,  I saw someone found edge transit before going to orbit and I giggled so much
---
On one hand, I'm a dirty huntard main and wanted these.
---
On the other hand, ~~fuck hunters in crucible that run spectral blades,~~ this is now a huge problem. Guess I'll keep using tether. *Shrug.*
---
F for all those who played match after match for the malfeasance quest back in Forsaken lol
---
There is a hidden chest?
---
Holy fuck... gotta redo it today
---
there are a few! go take a good look around
---
Can't see how tbh
---
Where is this?
---
F
---
I am curious this is the second time someone posted a print screen like this. I need to know where this was taken from?
---
It‚Äôs from the Destiny 2 companion app for mobile, it allows you to take gear in and out of your vault without going to the tower.
---
And also has a fireteam tab, or forums tab etc. 
---
Quite useful actually.
---
There‚Äôs nothing inherently wrong with it and yes, team sports also do this. You could easily treat the heavy ammo as the ‚Äòball‚Äô in this instance. To not even go for it, defend it, or play it, you‚Äôre inviting the other team to come at you. Attack is sometimes the best form of defence and in this case, had someone been watching the heavy there‚Äôs a chance it wouldn‚Äôt have been taken so easily. Yes, they might have lost their life but none so valuable a point when you add a second or two to collecting something so valuable as heavy.
---
If they *really* wanted to play tactically, they would‚Äôve just jumped off the map and avoided getting killed in spawn at all. 
---

---
Bro just get a good trust Lunas is worth it!
---
I'll look into it
---
Theres hundrets of cosmetics for your to aquire. Let them have their few eververse exclusives. You can count em on like one hand.
---
[There‚Äôs one missing](https://youtu.be/7kYdzn5phSU) 
---
All that for a small blocker
---
yes...yesssss.....that show made me do a vicious cycle of binging the episodes and then rewatch it....its a cursed show .-.
---
That's the one thing i've been asking myself for the past couple of weeks.. Whats even the point of playing something so similar but just a worse version? (except for the powerful gear)
---
I never used that exotic, but I have it. What's great about them?
---
I played D1 on my xbox 360 and honestly I don't feel like buying it again for my xbox 1 so nope sorry :/
---
I missed calus, fucking calus. He takes up half a screen, and I missed him. 
---
Oh . Shame 
---
Thanks for details!
---
Nice one 
---
I completed my first Eater of Worlds raid with a girl named cat leading us.
---
ü§î
---
Oh look, showing off with the emote :p
---
High ground doesn't really work to well considering spectral seems to have the magical ability to teleport up 10 metres in the air just to kill you.
---
got the gambit prime energetic pulse rifle (rapid-fire) with feeding frenzy/ramage ; 6th time "the sixth coyote" dropped on the ground ; 540 glory points in 5 comp games.
---
Yeah I'm not a HC guy but my friends have fantasies about them and NEVER SHUDDUP about em
---
The sherpas for Spire are honest to god angels. I‚Äôve barely run the Raid without a Sherpa, and every time without fail there is some mishap or dickwad that makes them show the absolute limit of human patience. Much love to the sherpas out there
---
I don't really mind it on TFL, it takes a little while to get used to it but you get loads of ammo and frankly, breach load grenade launchers would just be way too good if they would always explode on impact. PvP would just be guys running shotguns + TFL and the whole thing would be an utter mess.   
---
Using a heavy launcher though, I expect the damn thing to just explode on impact like it should. Unless it's The Colony. 
---
Oh like when I Novabomb a doorpost and kill myself in the process?
---
Good points and the ammo for this thing makes using it and missing not so bad. Excellent response. üëç
---
Yeah but cant see the weapon close up and im not at my console 
---
If you ever get the chance to buy the annual pass discounted I recommend you do, it adds more grind for better weapons and I'm glad I got it for cheaper than usual
---
Lmao dude, I hope next time you do not miss XD
---
Maybe bungie could make a age of triumph sort of thing where like after a set number of raids or some shit was done we could be rewarded with a brand new version of an exotic ornament included
---
How do you choose? I got the annual pass last week and they haven‚Äôt given me a choice yet
---
You can buddy, just see the announcements on  [https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinySherpa/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinySherpa/)  and  [https://www.the100.io](https://www.the100.io/)  or post you need a Sherpa (Raid Guide). That's how I found this amazing supergirl, who taught us this Raid.
---
I‚Äôm happy to hear that. Thank you for all the positivity. We really appreciate it. I‚Äôve shared your post with the other Sundog sherpas to let them know that what we do is important and appreciated. üòä
---
Hmm. Cobblestone, Brick, iron gate shadow. Are you on 2nd street? 
---
sure, whatever. don't care. ill buy what I buy.
---
I have to wonder how much additional revenue was actually made when deciding to make all shaders single use. 
---
The annual pass breaks down to a $3 a month subscription. They need someone buying mtx to make that a little higher, honestly. 
---
You have no idea how much I want too but I've gotta get those stupid precision headshots still.  It's torture because if im lucky I get like 3-5 a game.
---
You'd be surprised man, tap the trigger literally makes it a laser beam.
---
Rule 11 and Rule 12 cry in unison
---
Queue Strikes until you get it randomly if you're going solo, otherwise if you have a friend who isn't on that step of Thorn you can have them queue the normal version as fireteam leader.
---
I haven‚Äôt sided with anyone yet, what does it do 
---
I know it sounds like I am stupid. But, trust me, they are the same thing. The strike on titan is (because of thorn) Chasm of Screams. I have double and triple checked :))
---
step by step, literally 
---
Happens in any game everywhere. What's the point?
---
Your stomp the enemy team  
---
The enemy team stomps you
---
Close match
---
You stomp the enemy team
---
Repeat that cycle as much as you want in literally any online game, especially when solo queueing.
---
That's the absolute worst. When you activated for the primeval and a goblin comes and immune him... Then you are just standing there with your golden blue balls and hope that a teammate can beat the goblin before you super runs out. 
---
yes, this will work. thank you \^\_\^
---
The OG leviathan raid! Can drop from any encounter. Also occasionally sold by Benedict for Calus tokens.
---
If you‚Äôre on right now, queue up for the strike and make sure. If it loads you in with two other people then you can do it, otherwise, hop in the app and ask for some help. There is a cheese method to the thorn strike, if you get even one extra person they can go sit in a spot where they can‚Äôt be killed and you and the other person can clear everything else with no threat of wiping.
---
Am I missing something? Is everyone using Jot√ºnn a console thing? I see it pretty rarely on PC, assumedly because everything is more consistent so when you have something as spastic as Jot√ºnn you‚Äôre handicapping yourself
---
I had this too but I LFG'ed, found some very nice and talented folks to do this with and we completed the strike together. If I were honest I'd admit that they carried me but they didn't, I kicked ass :-/ .
---
Thanks for the advice. I'll cheese it first thing I get home from work :D 
---
You are, and if you want to support them a little more you can. That's why the ornaments aren't required. 
---
Tbh it‚Äôs not really that *good*, but it‚Äôs really fun to use. The vibration patterns on the controller may help with that 
---
Good thing we have mercy rules to end lopsided games...
---
I have seen lots of Thorns lately, now that you mention it...   
---
Seriously though, what's a "toxic weapon" in your mind?
---
It would be nice to have an option for just the ornaments. 
---
All bounties that give legendary or powerful gear can drop [it.It](https://it.It)'s RNG at it finest it took me 87 bounties for it to drop.
---
I got one from Hawthorne yesterday
---
Driftor
---
I don't even have Celestial...
---
That makes so much more sense. I‚Äôve been playing Destiny since around October and I can‚Äôt believe how much I‚Äôm still learning. I just started Destiny 1 over the weekend so I‚Äôm on Destiny overload 
---
Why was it necessary to point out that you were led by a girl and not a competent player? If it were a guy would you have said ‚Äúand a guy named X?‚Äù
---
wardcliff coiled myself on the Warlock well post, tree branches, pebbles...
---
Yeah, this is why I don't like running top tree so much despite the huge radius on it. For bottom tree, this is what I recommend:
---
a) Get to an area with good sightlines. Doesn't need to be out in the open, but if it is, that Spectral is out in the open too.
---
b) Don't stop spamming Quiver until the Spectral gets tethered. They have ridiculous super armor? So do you. And you're the one who still has a Super by the end of it.
---
c) Save Quiver until *only* a Spectral user pops their super. I feel like most other supers are outplayable for the most part, even the nice tracking ones like Dawnblade. I'd recommend keeping a Malfeasance or something handy, even though it's not exactly meta. If you get a chance to proc the stacks at least once, it's easy for other teammates to clean up even if other supers are making a beeline towards you.  Just don't try this on a Spectral Blades nerd. It won't end well.
---
Seems to me that if you're not really a got lover, that the vanguard is the choice to make. Gambit weapons are some of my favorites though. 
---
A very "kill two thralls with one stone" kind of situation. I will definitely try :))
---
Yeah but I want to get nf as well hopefully this season
---
Then whats the point of a super? Using it and dying instantly?
---
Yeah, good luck with that dude
---
At the higher ranks you'll mostly be against 4 stacks that actually know how to play the game well
---
Except getting my clan to log on for a leviathan is like pulling teeth. I switched from PS4 to PC since October and STILL haven't cleared it on this account. Because no one ever wants to do it and LFG is a crapshoot.
---
I prefer arcstrider
---
Supers as they are right now are way to dominant
---
I think they need to be killable so that people can't just charge towards an enemy and easily kill them
---
43 shards and 204 bright dust.
---
They hate us cuz they ain't us
---
Dual wielding hand cannons has been my destiny dream for a long time 
---
Karma is gay
---
I like Saladin line 'They thought they had you'. Exactly what I am thinking every time I bomb 'em to the face.
---
I don't mind it in normal game modes but I hate tether in mayhem, huge buzz kill
---
"Dude Perfect Destiny Edition"
---
I'd watch it.
---
Rapid Hit/Rampage is far superior
---
Zen Moment is pretty useless
---
*Cries in overnerfed nova warp*
---
Ah, a fellow [Hunter of culture](https://i.imgur.com/E4WaMPe.jpg). Can't wait to play around with the buffs tomorrow!
---
*but I really hate spectral enough to just use a buzzkill super instead*
---
or when you slova bomb the primeval and just miss the gap for it to track onto him, so you get nuked by him and have to float there and watch as your big purple turd floats away
---
Anyone remember when rhabby v did that with the oversoul in Crotas end?
---
yall ever thundermissle titan yah yeet off a cliff behind the boss?
---
And this one.
---
https://youtu.be/FXhr14qFx4M 
---
A man of culture indeed. I run Quickfang and the Quickfang hilt more now tho
---
Good luck i hope it works for you
---
No worries. 
---
The worst is firing a slowva bomb while the primeval is vulnerable but a goblin throws up a shield before it hits.
---
They need tuning yes but i rather touch them the duration and not make you a glass cannon
---
You went apeshit on light attack and got results for it
---
(Assuming you're on PC) You could try seeing if Bnet support can fix it for you if you used the same contact info for both accounts, but they probably won't be able to do anything about it, especially since you've already played it on the other account. (They would either have to remove all forsaken items and delevel your characters to 20, or lock the characters/account, or merge the accounts, and I don't think Blizzard is able to edit things for Destiny like they can their other games, aside from login/account related things)
---
My teammate totally did that last night on that strike lmao are you him? When I saw him do it I laughed cuz it's something I would do
---
LOL Awesome!
---
Yep have dreaming city unlocked too
---
Used to be spectral because of Bladedancer but now mid tree arcstrider is giving me so much hype
---
Are there any statistics on how many sided people with who? I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the majority sided with the drifter since he was the one asking up front.
---
Joking right?  shotty actually got damage buffs but range got reduced by 1m, which is fine.  Dust rock blues is still one of, if not the best shotty for PVP
---
I'm a Human, so Zavala disowned me from the Titan Order once I sided with Drifter.
---
Apparently it's coming back. I just wonder what'll happen to Worldline Zero at that point
---
I hope you didn‚Äôt expect anyone on reddit to even have a hint of intelligence.
---
This is why the enemies of humanity should fear us. 
---
Wait a sec, what platform &amp; map were you playing on? I *might* have been one of the spectral blades
---
Malfeasance, Ace of Spades.
---
I saw a warlock do that recently in competitive and I went from 
---
*Aw fuck here we go*
---
to
---
*Wait did he just...*
---
Oh I should have said legendary and you missed Thorn and The Last Word. 
---
I believe he means weapons like dust rock, Luna‚Äôs  howl, not forgotten, etc.
---
Spare Rations, with the right roll is probably the best in PvE right now IMO. Nation of Beasts from LW or Kindled Orchid are my favourite energy options.
---
You can set the account with Forsaken as the "home account" and log in to your other one with the DLC. All content on the "Home account" will be available even if you arent actively using it. 
---
This only works on Xbox. I use my brothers account for most of my games this way. 
---
Thank you so much dude, youre a legend &lt;3

I covered the timing problem in my reply too. You chose not to address, quote or read it.

That sounds like my kind of setup thanks!

Uh...Nope, I got before the end of S5 without spending a cent.

He's been declared innocent tho.

I forgot it was in the matrix thing. I didn‚Äôt get lucky and I paid for extra spins
---
Whut in Tarnation üòÇ
---
Aaah, fair enough.
---
I had a few free ones stacked up from previous weeks so I just got everything near the end.
---
Nope. That was just a quick edit I made from the Nightstalker tree selection screen. Would be nice tho, eh?
---
Beat me to the LED question lol
---
I've just realised my current legs have enhanced bomber and I use grenades a lot.
---
Hate the name, but I'm ready for the other stuff.
---
Well congratulations.
---
I have 28 full runs since it launched Sept 25th last year, and still no ship. This weeks 3 runs with no drop included.
---
I‚Äôve ‚Äúheard‚Äù each of the 3 encounters can drop the ship. So that‚Äôs 84 chances at it for me.
---
I completed all the other requirements for cursebreaker somewhere around November last year, leaving me in anguish for 5 months trying to get the ship drop.
---
At this point, I wouldn‚Äôt even be surprised if they ‚Äúbuffed‚Äù the drop rate, and it **STILL** doesn‚Äôt drop in my three runs here in another two weeks when its full curse again.
---
Bungie **HAS GOT TO** learn from this bullshit for rotors and seals in the future. Have almost dropped the game over it several times in this span of frustration.
---
I'll send you my current armour set but the exotic will probably change.
---
"I just wanna watch the fanbase BURN!"
---
When I run celestial nighthawk, I feel an immense stress from all the pressure on that one shot lol.
---
If your a bad player maybe. I‚Äôm assuming you don‚Äôt actually have not forgotten otherwise you wouldn‚Äôt make that claim. It‚Äôs very obtainable for any decent player, even easier this season with the increase of points gained.
---
Yes. Being able to tell what subs people are running would be a top priority. At least you'd think it would be noted by the "Crucible Team", that people have been asking for the change.
---
Year one Ikora armor. You can‚Äôt get it anymore.
---
It comes from the old ikora tokens I don‚Äôt think you can still obtain it
---
It doesn't really shorten the reload though. It won't shoot until the animation time ends, but you can sprint, aim or swap weapon instead of sitting there watching the whole thing.
---
Now that's dedication. F to the guardian.
---
Why on earth did they only make it a helm, chest and class item?  Why TF not make it an entire set??
---
traitor
---
Oh boy my Titan is Awoken
---
Not obtainable anymore
---
This isn't an mmo
---
0:28 kek
---
I'm so sad I missed out on both of those emotes.
---
They did that with each class and I guess no one has arms and legs or they are the most used exotic slots I guess.
---
I get that the vanguard is a noble and just in there intentions but they are morally and diplomatically inflexible.
---
BUNGIE RNG FOR YA üòÇ DAMN!
---
Didn't even think about that. REAL LIFE RNG SCREWS ME OVER TOO üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
I have to actually get celestial before I can wiff my shot :'(
---
I will get ringing nail and hammer head on my warlock and tatara gaze and blast furnace for hunter
---
I once did that 3 times to the Fanatic.
---
Alright alright alright
---
I‚Äôm scared for when mine comes in now üòÇ if I get a wayfarer instead of gambit we can swap!
---
Hive! Bring a sword
---
Wow bro. Salt much? May I inquire what gun takes skill to use in your eyes?
---
Or with a hunter using liars handshake
---
Titan suppressor grenades + Armamentarium + ordnance mods =  Fuck your super
---
I'd be more impressed if you won with dignity and just let the game end.
---
I know but the thread was about weapons that have terrible perks that people still chose to masterwork not ones that come that way for free.  But I do agree with you it is terrible..but I still couldn't bring myself to shard it.
---
Wrath of the machine messes me up everytime i read it.
---
"U WOTM8?"
---
are you on the destiny 2 pc lfg server? There‚Äôs a good amount of ppl doing levi runs, especially cuz there‚Äôs new players who want midnight coup
---
I can usually find a group in like 10 minutes on the weekends that are willing to teach the raids
---
newer raids like sotp or lw have less Sherpa runs but they‚Äôre still there (also a ton of ppl joining runs without knowing how to do it lol)
---
Good luck friend. My Hammerhead hunt is over (rampage/feeding frenzy/ stability MW) and I am happy with my Blast Furnace for now (rampage/feeding frenzy/stability MW).

Imagine a taken goat...

I have gotten no less than 10. But I cant get the whole planet of Mars to give me resonant stems
---
This literally happened to me yesterday.. My controller disconnected as I powered up and I had to Sprint to get my other one. Just as I reconnected to fire the boss moved. :/
---
If you want to spam abilities go play world of warcraft. D2 is a FPS, supers and abilities should take the backseat. It's so out of proportion right now it's retarded, like 5 respawns in a row I die to a super or LMG power spam. What is this? a shooter or what? where the fuck are the actual gunfights?
---
Remove super mods, reduce supers to 1x maybe 2x a match a person, same for power ammo, reduce duration and/or damage reduction while in super.  Remove one hit melee kills ( I main titan, and one hit melee is stupid). There your game is now 30x better, and im not a game dev - you welcome.
---
I've lost games because of spectrals or supers in general chaining their crutches and you can't even leave the spawn. Like I said is this a fps game or what? Doesn't look like it to me. Especially if you play well, the enemy will focus all their crutches on you and just ruin your mood. Im a 1.65 kd, average at best so imagine how an actual potent 3.0 player feels about the current state of the game.
---
Wait, how did you get this clip of me?!
---
For kindled orchid I love that you can have drop mag, outlaw and rapid hit with a reload masterwork for that extreme overkill reload, but seriously, probably fluted barrel, accurized rounds, kill clip, rapid hit, range mw.
---
What gun is that?
---
Ding ding ding!
---
I want a kindled orchid.
---
If you want me to be vague, any weapin that doesnt have 80 to aim asist and 95 to recoil direction (thats basically auto aim and no horizontal recoil - https://db.destinytracker.com/d2/en/items/153979396-lunas-howl) is a good place to start.
---
If you want me to be specific to hand cannons, pick any 110 HC
---
Sentinel armor was PS exclusive.
---
They are actually going to remake it for the upcoming event in a week or two. I need that mark again.
---
*Dies* the entire team: YOU FUCKIN WANKER
---
Hey OP you on ps4? (Sorry if I missed that but that was a long letter) I'd like to play with you and your son
---
I prefer 450 rpm pulse rifles so I'll eventually be bothered to get nightshade again.
---
They had 1 second on the revive timer. So when he died again it reached 0 and they all died.
---
Very true, thnx
---
No it does not
---
Shotgun in the throat with a Tractor
---
Yeah. It also looks like he looked where I pointed and was like. Oh. Ok
---
loo sorry to tell you this but you don‚Äôt need to have the emote. Just walk in front of them and hold square or whatever button you use to open chests and stuff
---
*Sadness noises
---
I play middletree arcstrider, with Worldline Zero, I sit on a beanbag, and i eat 2 minute noodles. I should probably see a psychiatrist.
---
yeppers.
---
It's gonna be so nice when they buff it and everyone is cursebreaker cause thats all were god damn waiting on.
---
&gt; But, from D1 to D2, Titans have historically been catered to when it came to PvP. Best jump, very versatile class ability, supers that are quite hard to counter without another super or heavy, and they have some of the most OP exotics. This is from D1 and D2.
---
Corrected some errors you made, remember to proof read!
---
Bruh I really don‚Äôt know who you‚Äôre playing with/against but they‚Äôre not doing you justice by letting you tether them
---
And yes
---
LETTING
---
So that's how he made all those caverns and tunnels, I always wondered tbh ü§î
---
I saw sentinel so I assume your a Titan can you tell me what you used as well please
---
That warlock at the end recovered fast from that heart attack
---
YOU WILL DRILL
---
Currently doing the reaper triumph, the massacre medals are a pain in the butt, and killing that many high value targets takes a while
---
Yeah you gotta play it safe, once you hit the number don‚Äôt touch the motes
---
"Going to kill this boss in one shot with this nova bomb!" Boss stomps mid-throw, hit wall with nova &amp; my body. Die.
---
I was blown away by how very little and not fun it was while being more surprised that the community was sssssoooo bad and just down right ugly to people being just honest and respectful about it. 
---
I haven‚Äôt touched it in forever and doubt I‚Äôll be back on it until a big update. 
---
For now. There is plenty still to work for in a place with great people over here in destiny land. Lol
---
What were those glow things you could get for armour before I started playing (around 1 month after forsaken)? I‚Äôve seen them listed on destinysets.
---
U Wot m8? Titans are the weakest in neutral game and have no support like feather or well, that‚Äôs not including super return exotics which are only for sentinel
---
WHY DO I FEEL LIKE IVE BEEN LIED TO ALL MY LIFE.
---
Titans: OK I'M GONNA THUNDERCRASH THAT PURPLE FUCK BACK INTO RED
---
*gets killed mid thundercrash*
---
It's a play on Shark week since all the arc subclasses were underperforming. Other elements will probably just get buffs without an event.
---
Yeah on Opposite Day. Hunters have a super returning exotic on every subclass
---
Yes I agree on that.  Grinding gm1 strongholds are the most efficient way to get loot
---
Just a strange time to do it with spectral on the field
---
What‚Äôs the issue?  There is no cursing or BM...just accept the free win, ladder points and go on with your life.
---
Titans: ‚ÄúCan we just have a super that‚Äôs even worth nerfing‚Äù Bungie: No boss melting super for you, or super that you gain back instantly.
---
It's very preemptive. Precognition would help, I bet lol.
---
Nothin‚Äô kills you quicker
---
This is the most wholesome comment thread I've seen today
---
My apologies fellow 'Farerü§óü§ó
---
Thank God! That's just the nerf I needed!
---
Can we get fists and scout rifles nerfed next?
---
That one I can relate with
---
Nighthawk Hunter or Phoenix Well Warlock.
---
Yeah and it's an auto aim one hit kill, throwing knives do so little damage that you're better off just shooting.
---
Your team must suck then. Not saying spectral blades doesmt need a nerf but if you or your team cant even land a shot on it than thats on you.
---
lmfao like everyone wasn‚Äôt complaining about what a shit show d2 was at launch
---
How about a raid boss? Yup, I'm sure we can do enough damage to Shuro, oops, there goes the shot.
---
Yeah they really *really* need to balance pvp and pve separately, it's a momunentally obvious thing to do.
---
What about the final boss?
---
You do know the drifter will yeet your ass if it means him being safe. The whole point of vanguard vs drifter was to either choose to fight an uphill battle(vanguard) or give up(drifter). Its why the drifter sought out the nine in the first place he wants a way out of whatever is coming.
---
Ding ding ding. The dash needs to severely hurt the duration so it‚Äôs used defensively rather than offensively.
---
I feel I'm definitely missing the joke here.
---
Nighthawk Hunter with 3 stacks of the buff basically one shots the boss. Against the ogre it does about a little more than a third of its hp or so.
---
Blades fired
---
Wow
---
I've seen someone just run past the bank and die with 5 motes that we needed for a primeval...
---
To be honest I think smoke bombs are insanely strong when you land them right but that takes a fair bit of skill. Shoulder Charge on the other hand...
---
This is wonderful!
---
Neat
---
The loot situation is far from the worst of the problems in that game. In fact, I have a theory that they're pushing the loot problem inorganically so people complain about that and ignore the other serious issues in the game.
---
Loot they can fix easily, lack of content and poor multiplayer/network implementation is far harder to fix, but if they wait a few months and claim they fixed the "most glaring issue"in the game, they'll basically get another boost in purchases by the people who waited to buy. Also, a lot of people push how amazing the game feels, but I feel like that's nonsense too--movement and combat in the game is EXCEPTIONALLY clunky.
---
That'll teach you to be a hunter!
---
do you want the xbox version or the pc version?
