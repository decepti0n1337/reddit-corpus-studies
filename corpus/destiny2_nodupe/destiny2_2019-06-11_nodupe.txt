I just wanted a fun RPG shooter with good optimization/function :(
---

---
Anthem failed at the optimization/function point when I had to change my hardware mouse sensitivity, and I lost sound multiple times in beta and full release. Once I got past that, it failed the ‚Äúfun‚Äù part because I had to open the tomb lol.
---
If Destiny were M-rated, I‚Äôd guess she had a few choice words in her head about the Spider in that moment

Ngl I did my first ever run of Last Wish yesterday and when the group was teaching me, they mentioned ‚Äújoining allies.‚Äù We had to pause for a minute or two because I laughed very hard. After that, I asked if anyone in there knew the legit way and they all said no. I had a blast guys.
---
Or host quitting out to freeze Croat in place...
---
I think you have to dodge near an enemy. Though that might just be Cammy refusing to run the reload dodge
---
And this is why I absolutely loathe and hate Blade Barrage. One of the worst moves on Bungie‚Äôs part to add to the game
---
Whats the bottom right upgrade?

My other characters automatically got 690 gear when I switched to them after completing the invitation

Wait.... it took you THIS long to get Le Monarch?

U might know this already, but prospector is the new meta for cheesing her. Cluster bomb is out of style (and less effective)

Is THAT what you have to do? I always just stop shooting the boss when I realize nothing special has happened yet and then the boss freezes "on his own."

That‚Äôs crazy cause it‚Äôs the rune I have most of

Ok still slightly confused. So I have destiny 2 vanilla on battlenet. The forsaken complete collection is currently on sale for 40 bucks. That will come with expansion 1 and 2 which will be free in September. But also forsaken which I will have to buy in the fall anyway to be caught up. That right? Cuz I wanna play more than just vanilla and catch up before the new expansion in september
---
It's a reference to a tweet from "dustin Couch" apparently
---
Between 1-3%.
---
Yes. Until it‚Äôs full.
---
Repost.
---
That was a mistake. It's on Bungie's website, they're looking into it because they should respawn on Tuesday reset.

NinjaPups did a phenomenal video summarizing the whole process: https://youtu.be/LJXlkd8xUS8
---
I used Esoterickk's videos to get mine: (https://youtu.be/kNt1Wtu9IoI)
---
Yeah, too bad it's a bit flimsy, but hey it's something to improve
---
Looks like a good place for sniper kills for those struggling
---
The annual pass only includes the forsaken annual pass items but NOT the actual forsaken addon. The complete collection has the annual pass items, the base game, both expansions AND forsaken. The complete collection is also the only way to buy the forsaken addon right now. So if you ALREADY own forsaken, just get the annual pass. If you DONT own forsaken, and want it then you have to buy the complete collection.
---
Warlocks suck the D, death to all of you. Stupid class with silly dress on. TITAN FOREVER! ;)

Not destiny 2 related.

Drang bad, Roderic-C is where it‚Äôs at fam

It's a joke about the new season..?

Oh Lorde

i mean, it *is* 8 people

How

Exactly

I don‚Äôt see the issue, you can buy forsaken and the  annual pass.

Accurate.
---
Wow, looks super realistic. Unfortunately it has a shader, so I know it's fake. So close, yet so far

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even take PvP seriously it just sucks it‚Äôs totally unbalanced you don‚Äôt even have a chance so why bother lol?‚Äù

&gt;me, a day 1 D1 PvP main
---
‚ÄúSo this is why I must suffer.‚Äù
---
In all seriousness it‚Äôs not any special kind of ‚Äúbroken‚Äù and I see mostly inexperienced players blame their gunplay on the outcome of matches when it‚Äôs usually their mobility and tactical sense that‚Äôs costing them fights.
---
I saw them near the Vex Public Event near Failsafe
---
Couldn‚Äôt clear it. Gonna kill my sef
---
Didn't really call but ask for it but stillüëå
---
So is that a front handle or is that it‚Äôs mouth and bites enemies too close ?
---
Prospector may have super high dps but specifically for Riven. Aggressive frame clusters still does a lot more dps. Heck even an aggressive frame spike high velocity grenade launcher does more dps.
---
best thing about revoker is i can take shots i wouldnt usually because of my ammo. now i can try quickscopes and no scopes all day
---
Your multiple deaths kept that storm trance alive so it wasnt in vain
---
Uldren wishes he was this
---
yeah relate, i got mine just yesterday, its super nice being able to just take shots you usually wouldnt.
---
At least I was useful in one way lol

Finally an honest artist on reddit. Have an upvote.

This is a shame to read. Was really pumped about a

---
Unpopular opinion: it's because pvp in destiny is an absolute shit show, unbalanced to the point of it being worthless. When only about 1-3% actually enjoys it, well no surprise people afk it. It's not fun, so why should you try and compete? D2 pvp has reached the point where the majority doesn't care about it anymore.
---
My quest begins, to make an entire quickplay match dance and emote.
---
excuse me wtf.
---
is that emote a sit emote now? it used to make you stand up after a few seconds

Looks like the invader sniped you as you went into the portal. Better luck next time.

Great shot on his part üëåüëå
---
We wait.
---
First two times:D game also longest with these guys
---
 Nope his name is Stefan
---
YOU'RE BREATHTAKING!
---
Meanwhile every match I tried last night was sweaty AF with no afk‚Äôers and no one wanted to let me get grenade kills without really fighting for it! I‚Äôd love to find these afk matches!
---
The drawing is great but i think exos look the best in that shot
---
I think so
---
And Rumble.
---
No it isnt. Grenade launchers FAR out dps tractor cannon and clusters. It really isnt even close. Especially since tractor only gives +35% to non void so golden guns do 15% less than if you used a melting point, not to mention someone is not using a heavy if they use tractor. 
---
You can 5 man riven with a well, MP, and 5 mountain tops. Just did it the other day. And prospector is even higher than that
---
How does one acquire such a fine emote?
---
Yeah the game dosnt screens hot properly when I have hdr on.
---
That Primeval came from Gambit.
---
What roll do you have on your beloved?
---
It‚Äôs for an upcoming exotic quest on July.
---
You complete a triumph for each bounty completed. Each triumph you complete for the Menagerie gives you 500 imperials. If you've done the bounties like you say you have, go to the destinations part of your triumphs part, then select the third tab on that page and collect your triumphs which then gives you imperials. Since you've done all 4 bounties from the first week, this should give you 2000 imperials.
---
Also, when you complete the bounty it will give you a treasure chest map as a new bounty. Go and complete that as well for more imperials. These dont take long.
---
There's a reference to it a couple times in the game already. I heard it in a mission this week.
---
i am the only one with mw weapons so that doesn‚Äòt work but thanks for the tip

I believe that one is snapshot and ambitious assassin, not the best for PvP but I like! (I also don‚Äôt have the runs to farm for a god role because I‚Äôm not AFKing mayhem)

Yeah aha trying to get to the point in the where i can actually so the power surge missions and get enough light to get at sweet thorn hehe

Priceless B-)
---
If you haven't, go and complete treasure map you get from each bounty. Not sure but you may have to do those to complete each bounty triumph
---
ty
---
Yeah lol
---
I know, it's in great!
---
This meme kept running through my head when I used Skull after the patch.
---
I see the logic behind the nerf, but a very well placed Slowva should at least return half your super IMHO.
---
TRON boots ftw
---
r/instantregret
---
Nova Bomb also has Skull of Dire Ahamkara which is still better than Shards is now or will ever be. Skull‚Äôs effectiveness was hilarious in its prime, allowing you to get full Super on around 5-6 kills.
---
The melee ability is very useful in pve, but, like all throwing knives, are an absolute joke in pvp. It is not true that it has the fastest melee recharge.
---
Best grenades in the game? Good luck with incendiary, swarm does low damage, and tripmine is still non-lethal at full health and can be avoided.
---
For an RPG game where the Hunter is supposed to be the fast, stealthy scout I would sure *hope* the have the best mobility in the game. However, exploits like Titan skating, and Warlock + Worldline makes players go at the speed of sound faster than any hunter. Warlocks have much better speed and their horizontal jump helps them with it too.
---
Their dodge is an *ability*. I sure hope it provides *some* usefulness and effectiveness like a reload and damage resistance. Don‚Äôt compare it to Warlocks and complain. It‚Äôs SUPPOSED TO BE UNIQUE. 
---
I could say the same thing about Warlocks. ‚ÄúOh, warlocks have an area of effect that heals or buffs major damage for the WHOLE TEAM for A LONG TIME!!‚Äù
---
You see what I mean?
---
Warlocks easily outclass both other classes in PvE and are much more effective and useful.
---
I would admit Hunters‚Äô skill sets allow them to have more potential in PvP but it‚Äôs time you pull the stick out of your butt and stop complaining.
---
When do we get more info about the free to play thing and the cross save feature?
---
Not just that. Apologies if I was unclear, formatting was also a nightmare.
---
According to videos I‚Äôve seen on YouTube and threads on /r/sharditkeepit the velocity stat does actually factor into the # you see when the grenade impacts the target. I‚Äôve noticed in the case of spike grenade launchers and the reckoning GL that can roll full court, this impact number is significantly higher than the blast portion. All this in addition to the velocity making the projectile easier to hit, as you had correctly stated.
---
In general I think the rule is for PVE you want Velocity paired with spike nades/impact casing. For PvP you want whatever will help your neutral game (quick draw, reload speed maybe) and blast radius because it‚Äôll be easier to get a one-hit-kill even if you miss your direct impact.
---
Thanks much. Not too many words at all. Much appreciated.
---
I have a follow up question. I went to Nessus, got the quest to put together the chalice. And...nothing. It's not pointing me in a direction. 
---
Is there a quest tracker in D2? How can I see what my objectives are to get started on SoO?
---
Also, since SoO is the new hotness, I assume there's no value in doing the Black Armoury? Except for specific Exotics? (Assuming they'd drop from BA)
---
They might be Sith though....
---
Alone as a God has Snapshot Sights, too or the good old Aachen LR2
---
First time I've ever done a week 1 anything. Luckily I had my friends and a couple new ones. We got 2 full clears in and it was glorious! We struggled for hours! The first clear took us around 17-20 hours to get through. No kackis vids. No datto vids. Just good ole fashioned panic attack inducing figure it out yourself lol. Great times. I love this game. 
---
Congrats to you and your team as well!

It's already on sale now. The only thing that'll happen in September is that dreaming city and tangled shore will become available for free and you can do patrols and you can explore them but will still need to buy forsaken and annual pass to get access to the content.
---
Reminder comment.

Can I buy the shadowkeep and year 3 pass in a bundle and if so, how much will it be at least

Cayde 7, whom we jealously cut down before Calus?

That joke came from the moon!
---
Sniping definitely feels different in D2, but it does feel better than it did. Just keep at it though... like anything else, repetition &amp; practice will help you improve. 
---
Snapshot is a must IMO for PvP, and adding QuickDraw to that is a nice bonus. Moving target is another good perk I personally like on a sniper when paired with snapshot.
---
Cute private match

You can add shaders to them, if that's what you mean.

40 for a level 20 mount flying mounts are considerably more though
---
I can‚Äôt wait to get to this point.
---
Ah yes I was, although I assumed people would get more ticked off at the 5 afk people in the match. Bad on me I Guess.
---
I got it last night after the two people in the strike playlist left because it was the vex strike on mercury and I didn‚Äôt have anyone else join the strike for some reason and just farmed it out in like an hour
---
The first time you go into menagerie you have to spend the imperials to install the tube. I only have 500 from the first triumph. I can‚Äôt open the chests because I don‚Äôt have the upgrade.

Video games are subject to discounts and price reductions as time goes on. If you want to be on the cutting edge, the tradeoff is that you will not be taking advantage of the deals that come up after something has been released for a while. 
---
Whether or not it's worth it to buy things sooner rather than later is subjective. I got Destiny 2 during year 1, and despite all its problems I still had fun and don't regret that. However, I bought Curse of Osiris and Warmind the first time they went on sale, and did not end up feeling like it was worth it. 
---
Despite a few hundred "is it too late if I don't do this within a day of release" type questions in this subreddit, I don't think it's ever too late to do D2 things, so if that is what is making people want to buy right away, I would say don't, it's ok to wait.
---
If you aren't doing this as a paid service, and just offering to play Crucible with players to help them get pinnacle weapons, you might try r/fireteams or r/DestinySherpa.
---
Part of me wants every game I'm in to be like this so I can farm for mountaintop.
---
And the other part of me is screaming at them for being AFK the whole game.
---
I wish it did, pretty sure the izanagi catalyst is from Heroic Menargerie. As for the catalyst it increases the damage of honed edge x4.
---
Cool story.
---
Ahhh gotcha, yeah I can‚Äôt decide. I like them all üòÇ
---
You're damn right pay up or shut up n let me hustle. Thanks for the info tho
---
Thanks so much for taking the time to write this, exactly what I was looking for!
---
Very cool

?????
---
I‚Äôm looking too right now let me know if you find anything

The amount of times I‚Äôve done this on scourge but with blade barrage instead of golden gun is priceless.

indeed, my titan went with the Drifter, i now have to go and speak to the Spider but nothing happens.

So yeah waiting till bug fix :(
---
I'm jelly, nice rolls!
---
To be 100% clear, the annual pass isn't a subscription, it doesn't expire. It's a bundle of three DLCs. Once you buy them, you have them forever, as DLC standardly behaves across all games in this manner.

That strike was awesome. I want more strikes like we had in D1

You need to be Ascendant for this chest. Just run through like normal, then there is a balcony towards the back. Just run near that and you‚Äôll be able to see the platforms.
---
First one was found by the imperial barge (??? Nowhere near the cistern), gotta be ascendant
---
Second by killing the ogre at jetsam of Saturn
---
Third by the blind well, also gotta be ascendant
---
$450 with glowing eyes and everything.
---
That was hilarious
---
I just came back from not playing since a month after drop switched over to siege and cs and came back pvp is still decent and the game is well improved
---
Adding to this if you shoot your gun while near them they dip
---
Pure stupidity

The amount of bridge builds I've failed because one big boi stomps the entire team off of the bridge at the same time is mad, I've stopped  doing the reckoning solely because of the bridge stomps now
---
Are you sure because I went in with two of my characters and I didn‚Äôt get it
---
How was there not a single blade barrage? Ha I tried to run bubble and it was instead death by 1000 knives every time.
---
Didn‚Äôt get it or didn‚Äôt find it? Because I was just telling you all where I found it, but perhaps it has more spawning points in the dreaming city?
---
I want a drunkard Guardian character. Now that‚Äôll be a fan favorite.
---
That's problem, I have a titan and a warlock and want to get into playing them, but grinding through forsaken again, is so tedious and boring on the 2/3 play through. I can also sense a little bit of aggression, in which I would like to say, apologies for bringing up any sort of 'Hunter Struggle' PTSD. I'm just a casual spreading his thoughts. I'm sorry.
---
I agree that is the absolute worst part of the reckoning
---
Oh thanks also if you don‚Äôt mind I want to know if there are to versions of the legendary collection or no?
---
After you are done, movin towards the previous week area, that is straight through the door, right on the hallway, jump on the pipes, the jump up the two horizontal platforms and there it is. It sounds complicated but just walk forward, turn right and follow the path
---
Here‚Äôs a fun one: ever try popping Super on a Meatball while you‚Äôre a Striker? 
---
Not so Super.
---
I'll give this a go, thank you Guardian.
---
A big overshield that lasts for 2 or 3 seconds coupled with a supercharged melee so we can wail away on the boss like prime Mike Tyson until it wears out would be awesome and make the super a lot more damaging.  
---
We could either run away just before the supercharge ends, or keep punching until it runs out and we are boss stomped into an alternate dimension (noone would pick option 1).
---
Use *MORE* Red Pepper, Guardian!

Bug
---
For the rocket launcher ",Truth"
---
Sounds to me like you're doing it wrong
---
Victorian Silverhawk actually scares the hell out of me
---
boy do I have bad news for you about the new heavy MG that can roll with rangefinder.
---
Yes
---
Observe my superior collection of hip fire sniper rifles!
---
I beat it the 3rd time (3rd time's the charm i guess) after i figured out not to spam my shots at the first 2 heralds. Aim at the first dude's hand and when it starts glowing, shoot and then quickly but controllably switch your aim to the 2nd herald and fire one shot again and then aim at enkaar asap and spam at his hand. Simple, even at console.
---
I think they said they are doing a sort of a'la carte system for the next expansion and you can do it then. Are you on console or PC?
---
It's not that the location bothers me, it's the fact that I have to keep filtering by newest every single time to find them.
---
I dont expect anyone carrying, I try my best, but I am playing a game, and trying to have fun. And not being grinded out to be max light or whatever wont stop me from trying new game mode.
---
Perhaps back when it was Free to Play for a bit they activated the content but never downloaded? Nothing should be F2P until September.
---
The person didn't say anything about being carried at all they just said there a little underpowered you can go in there at like 707 and still put in a good ammount of damage and depending on the person's play style they can be very valuable
---
Did you check where your pursuits are supposed to be? I am guessing you totally missed that pursuits were moved to the map with this season.
---
It's in your pursuits tab, you access that section now through the map
---
It is not currently free now so if they are seeing it to install, they redeemed it when it was free before or already purchased it.
---
I can't speak to all builds but I will tell you I am loving Chaos Reach with Getaway Artist. Let's you turn your grenade into a very strong Arc Soul that lasts 15 seconds. Chaos Reach is nice because you get Ionic Traces on kills which cool down all your abilities. I usually pop my Arc Soul buddy and have it back even before the 15 seconds ends. I can often chain the Arc buddy. Maybe not the strongest but certainly a ton of fun.
---
Maybe the runes are activity based?
---
I knew it, Hive worships Khorne.
---
Just like they messed up with the chests and the wealth.
---
Exactly, thanks
---
It's well suited to Destiny 2's ancient controller options. They haven't hardly changed at all in the 19 years since the launch of Halo: Combat Evolved
---
You called?
---
When ur shoulder charge literally one hits guardians, but ur still not satisfied with it.
---
Nooooo eyasluna kicked too ugly for me it was like hawkmoon which I also don't like
---
I use the better devils which is closest aside from ace to the imago
---
Wait what's this about farming a chest? I haven't heard of it. Can y'all explain pls.
---
Garbage game mode is frustrating enough.
---
I still think Burning Maul needs a buff as well...cool super with meh damage but Thundercrash is an absolute turd of a super...just like Titans are right now
---
Ok first of all I'm going to ignore those hurtful comments about my two favourite guns, secondly you could put a counterbalance mod on the austringer to fix the recoil?
---
If you don't like that my only other suggestions are using nation of beasts or the kindled orchid
---
If it‚Äôs actually you, I‚Äôm actually very sorry. On the bright side, mayhem ceases to be for now
---
Would you comment on [this megathread?](https://old.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bzjpkr/official_lfg_megathread_v_4/?) Just trying to consolidate things a bit.
---
Oh no oh god 10 crucible bounties AaAh I‚Äôm nowhere near as good as I used to be in the crucible

Yeah it reset on a sunday- not sure why though, I expected it on a reset day but unless it was a glitch it‚Äôs a weird schedule.
---
What sniper is that?
---
fate cries
---

---
Nah, just bad humor on the internet. Never have been and never will be married. Good on you, though.
