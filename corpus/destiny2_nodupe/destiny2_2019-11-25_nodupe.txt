Really damn impressive.

It's already in their site as a vehicle option. Sooo just google Tesla lol and look

From what I gather bergusia has no key.
---
Edit: Whoops. Looked it up, I didn't have enough amethyst for it to pop. Enjoy your izanagis!
---
Something you do in a day ain’t a grind fest, bud

And yesterday, and today, and tomorrow until reset.

Depends on who is wielding it

Slone because she probably killed a loyal space marine of the imperium and stole his pauldrons and purity seals.
---
Ok thanks
---
I have plan to do heroic today https://discord.gg/9zjRFn I am shadow come
---
Temptation is better change my mind
---
Bergusia does have a key but to get it you need to finish the key mold quest first.
---
You need to comeplete the key mold steps first before you can get the bergusia key
---
So you wouldn’t say the range on it is a little overpowered?
---
It may become available for purchase with Bright Dust one week, content from previous seasons usually cycles in and out. But if or when that might be I can't say.
---
Cross save first. Then get that set up and log in. Then buy the dlc on steam. You need forsaken and shadowkeep, the rest is free and part of the base game now.
---
Its all through steam though. If you make a steam account now, and just buy the dlcs now, then use that account for the crosssave, that will work too. Whichever way. Just make sure you use the same steam account for the crosssave as the one that purchased the dlcs. That's the big one.
---
I don’t know, but it is kinda smexy
---
Fair enough haha. That was my next plan😂
---
Pvp le monarque
---
Lol
---
Im a titan main. I dont think "not playing titan correctly" is the issue here. All of the abilities are second nature to me and I'm more comfortable with them than i am with a hunter...
---
Also,  what is so wrong with having a pointless PvP class? Titan and warlock both have them too.
---
There's actually a kill barrier gigantic sad
---
Did you try skullfort when New Light dropped? I feel so ashamed of myself.
---
Definitely one of the more fun subclasses to use for sure!
---
Its broyles!
---
This is one of a few things that will kill trials of they bring it back and don't require any purchase or dlc to access it.
---
And that is the fatal flaw of the Vanguard. But ask yourself this: is the Vanguard or Guardians themselves so innocent? After all it was the Vanguard that took the first shot on the Moon. And look how many Guardians were shot down. 
---
Look at what the Iron Lords did at Eaton. It was Lightbearers who ended the Black Armory founders. 
---
If Drifter is a snake, then the whole City is a den for them. 
---
Things aren't so black and white anymore. But the Vanguard, Iron Lords, Guardians. They aren't so innocent. If Drifter is a snake, then Zavala is an Anaconda. Squeezing the City with rules and walls.
---
I sat on my old 1.0 750 gear all the way until I started getting 950 drops
---
Bring back old mag howl, there’s nothing pinnacle about Luna’s/NF without it
---
yes I think that one of, if not the only super that cant catch someone running away is overpowered
---
my hunter brethren!
---
I just feel sad. Warlock PvP is... sad.
---
Can confirm accuracy.
---
That FPS makes me sad.
---
I had to trim the video on my xbox im sad too
---
This isn't Florida, but I remembered [this](https://puu.sh/EIjnN/0104198fdd.jpg) when I lived up north. More than likely OP was dealing with this.
---
Its a pleb dreg.
---
I enjoy Hush. It's perk isn't too bad in PvE (from my experience, I'm still sorta new I guess). I usually avoid bows in PvP as firerate seems to be king from my experience.
---
You gotta grind if you want Hush though.
---
If it were brought back it would be useless considering it alr hits three taps without it because of the change of rpm. And if it were then it would just be overpowered and nerfed again.
---
I still love my NF
---
Arcstaff is my least used subclass in pvp lmao
---
It's more like now you have to do the same repetitive stuff to increase your light level because you haven't bought the DLC, basically your weekly nightfall stuff is going to be your only hope.
---
Greg the pleb dreg
---
They’re still amazing guns yes!
---
good job im not touching that with a ten foot pole with boku no pico on it
---

You either stomp or get stomped, there's practically no in-between. Playing with randoms is 90% hell and a massive pain but playing with friends who actually know what to do and have IQ above room temperature is actually pretty fun.
---
We are in fact superior to these APES
---
Sidearms are not viable in PvP really. Their TTK just isnt good enough.
---
Not quite, theres a muzzle break, red dot, and different sights lol

I need these

I have 1696 items

I'm a fairly new player to Destiny 2, and I'm having trouble figuring out how to get Challenges to be accessible. I need to complete a challenge in order to complete a Bounty that I'm working on.
---
According to online guides, Challenges are unlocked at the Farm after completing the story mission "Fury", and then talking to the farm overseer. I did so. At that point, I should be able to talk to Ikora Rey to unlock them. The problem is, Ikora Rey is not at the Farm. Neither are Cayde-6 or Zavala, and the video I watched showed all three of them standing on a balcony at the Farm. That balcony is empty for me.
---
I tried talking to Ikora Rey back at the Tower, as well, but she had nothing new to say. I also considered the possibility that I might already have them unlocked without realizing it - but if I did, they don't seem to show up when I bring out my Ghost (it only displays tagged quests, or the message "no tagged quests" if I haven't tagged any).
---
Any idea what I might be doing wrong?
---
Me and a buddy just started again as well. Were hardcore players before.

izanagis burden was unobtainable at the time due to a bug.

I would say yes if you could avoid getting shotguned or Fusion rifled.

Ugh! I think I am pretty far into the campaign before it really "clicked".
---
I had a guy on my team running double shotguns yesterday. He ran that loadout the entire match and got 1 kill. This is at Mythic I by the way.
---
Pick up every bounty and quest you can. If you are killing an enemy for no reason, that's wasting exp time
---
Bless those babies  🤣

I can confirm I will try it out but maybe try some more blade barrage.

Golden Gun shots :(
---
Check the map for stuff that gives powerful rewards. Do those. The strike one should still be bugged tho, you actually need to do 3 playlist strikes while equipping the same element the singe is (currently void, will change tomorrow)
---
Take me with you
---
so all your weapon and armor on 915 light already? finish weekly bounties,  finish 8 bounties from each vanguard, crucible, gunsmith and gambit, and finish 3 strike 3 gambit and 4 rotator crucible and 4 crucible, and weekly flash point this week is on edz also give you 1 powerful engram, and join clan also give you 1 powerful engram, total 10 engram, its a +15 powerlight atleast and quicktips: after get 1 powerful engram, turn on token to vanguard or crucible to get other equipment equal to that 1 you just get.
---
yeah it was more rhetoric i think? idk much english but, yeah, only dipshits invade on dps time.
---
edit: I have send my friends on to invade bc i know the invader is going to kill them, and if he uses his super + the wall hacks from invading they might get 2 kills so is a good trade lol
---
Rip bro
---
Ah yes. Watch out for blast furnace though, he can snipe you across the map, and does lots of damage when merciless is also shooting you.
---
But it’s not dead like Cayde...
---
I’m sorry
---
If your ghost resurrects you, do you get your foreskin back?
---
You need to complete the machinegun frame quest until the point where you need to forge it before you gain access to the forges.
---
Ancient Gospel from Garden of Salvation is a really good 140 RPM solar hand Cannon. I really like it in PVP
---
Synthoceps are pretty top tier for anyone using a shotgun though. The main combo to that playstyle is to shotgun+melee just in case you don't get the 1 shot kill, but with synthoceps' melee range being out to the next zip code you don't even need to be within shotgun ohko range to guarantee kills with the combo
---
It's also nice to use with chaperone or other slug shotguns since you can body someone and melee them
---
Also, knockout + thundercoil still wipes entire teams, so having even more melee range than knockout greatly amplifies this
---
I want to say yes, but I cant, my soul wont let me say "buff titan"
---
Oh so even though, as i have read, all characters have access to the forges from the beginning, the machine gun frame quest still has to be completed?
---
Ok thx I will try this even if im trash in the crucible
---
Will it be big expansion like forsaken ?
---
Well, you know you've hit one when you get "MARKED FOR VENGEANCE" lol
---
As for killing one, well, your random teammates will message you and tell you your a hero lol

I love this video so much, I want it to be put on a loop right on my headstone after I die
---
How much does one scout rifle kill give ?
---
Necro response ik, but hollowed lair is in rotation right now and it drops mindbenders ambition, the best pvp shotgun currently. Go for a roll with quick draw and snapshot, accurised rounds, full choke and a range masterwork. This thing can 1 tap people at obnoxious range and looks sick as f*ck. It's my personal "titan b gone" gun and I normally run it with a hand cannon or SMG.
---
Tracking while running a sniper is basically a free kill

thanks for the info

This was me but with vex mithoclass and black hammer

Wow thanks so much!! That actually helps a ton lol. Also noob question: what do you mean in rotation? And hoe do i spam it to get the most chances at it?

I don't think the 750 drops exotic in a higher chance compared to world drops.

Meh, i don't think you are worth useful and thoughtful answers.

I use it because it reloads 1-2 shots from reserves. Good if you are agressive.

use the companion app, i see a a few people asking for escalation protocol there

You're into some fucked up shit bro
---
Well that explains it
---
Alright alright alright let’s see what we got!
---
DIDNT ASK
---
Same for me
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you misunderstand what I mean by, "lock in," your role.
---
I'm not saying that you wouldn't be able to perform any other role by committing to one role or another, but that by committing to one role or another, you're saying, "this is my job, let me do it!"
---
I just read [an article](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/e15hon/to_yoteun_the_sentry_titan_who_left_a_hell_of_an/) that I think perfectly describes what I mean.
---
I quote:
---
*"A day or so ago a friend of mine and I were playing some Gambit Prime as we usually do. We like to complain at each other about a lot of the pubbers. He's a collector, and regularly has motes swiped as people deposit 3. I'm an invader, who primes themself with all the goodies right before the portal opens up, only to have someone leap through with 7 motes and die horribly within seconds. Basically, normal commiseration about the worst of the worst players."*
---
They then go on to say:
---
*"Normally, I sit mid and shoot at the mobs, kill blockers, and plink off invaders while waiting for an invasion of my own. I like to remain useful and supportive even when unable to directly engage."*
---
They then go on to describe just how amazing of a Sentry this, "Yote-Un," really was.
---
The above would still remain the same even with the changes that I am proposing, it's just that roles would be more defined.
---
Basically, the whole purpose of the selection screen would be to ensure that both teams have all four roles covered. You'd still be able to provide support from mid as an Invader while waiting for the portal.
---
You'd still be able to pick up motes as a Reaper or Sentry. You'd still be able to kill Invaders &amp; Blockers even if you're not a Sentry, and so on.
---
It's just that (currently) roles aren't well defined and, thus, aren't as impactful as I personally would like them to be. I hope this clears things up a bit! :D
---
Thx
---
I feel the same, mate
---
Ran Bergusia Forge a few days ago and I got two hammerheads, the one from the weapon frame and the curated one.

True, but i have bad internet connection so if i bought ps plus then half of my games probably wouldnt function right. And the games that you get for free mostly suck and if they are cool then if your ps plus runs out you cant play them anymore, or you need to buy ps plus again.

Looks super good!!

A whole month of grinding and an almost broken controller. The hardest one was just reaching 40k triumph score due to how long that took compared to the other triumphs

Tmw Snipers are easy to counter by simply flanking or using cover effectively.
---
Guy, ik how to play titan.. its satire
---
The 0-10 is because every 10 of a stat is the same, like 71 is the same as 79.  Unless you break the next 10, you don't gain from it.
---
Try and verify it in steam if you havent already
---
Wallhack is fine, but duration is quite long. Heal is ok, but overshield isnt. Thats what I think about it. 
---
Why? Hunters have similar thing, but instead of healing, they deal more dmg. OEM should offer that many perks, it makes it stand out and it pvp it makes it very strong when used correctly.
---
Its such a pain to make the hammers connect

No, he doesn‘t like karma farming

---
Never complain about too much special ammo. We know from experience
---
Most titans don't, that's the problem. Asher Mir is right.
---
I thought as you but later i changed my mind because i realized that the point is in collecting specyfic weapons and if weapon can have random perks also with specyfic perks. Collecting new weapons and using different gear to experience new playstyles is very important mechanic. And with 750 power you can do whatever you want because most activities have 750 power basr scaling. Starting from 0 will mean that you can't play strikes, adventures or other basic activities. And the bigger difference betwen base and your power (of cource if you have higher) makes activity easier for you. So if bungie will add base scaling of 0 it will make these activities super simple for top power players. And its not like every one before had to grind from 0. I find out thare were missions for new "base" power for those who didn't get it before the update.

Problem is, with Outbreak if u don't have time to practice it and get it perfect then u will never get it done. It's a quest that u will fail over and over many times (depends how good ur are) before u can do it. There are lfg sites to find teams even for a solo player.

Shit, we have a one hit melee? Sign me up!
---
While possible, those would either take massively more time (3 gambit matches already being like 2-3x a quick nightmare hunt) or frustrating for a lot of people. It would also be weird, seeing that 20 kills in a normal match is massively harder compared to 20 kills in momentum control or even mayhem. Kills (not counting assists) is also a pretty flawed and hated topic on its own already.

---
More rationally I love swords. They're situational in use but boy you can really tear into stuff with them, and the parry is fun.
---
Well was put down to a 25% damage buff. Bubble is a 30-35% buff, and tether is a 25% debuff I believe. Currently, before divinity is nerfed, you can only stack 1 buff with one debuff + divinity. So bubble with tether and divinity is the most you can get I believe.
---
"FOR YOU MASON, NOT FOR ME"

I bet that -48 hurt didn’t it?

Exactly, that's very rational. I'd like them, but I wouldn't love them. I'd like them for what they could do, but I'd probably feel a little bit dirty using the Recluse in PvP for instance.

There's a known issue with these quests in that some weapon frames forged do not count unless you get a curated roll, according to Bungie.
---
I've had this same issue for weeks as well, including this one. I had never forged a bow or hand cannon before and only the hand cannon counted (yes, both frames were purchased using ballistic logs received from completing the 2 weekly bounties).
---
I’m a bit of a simpleton. Can someone summarise what these charts say? I’m guessing me using intellect mods is a total waste.

That's an...uhh...interesting game description. I kinda really want to play it now
---
They look like fucked up vegetables
---
&gt; It could honestly just be a massive number of staple activities that you do with no one else in your fireteam.
---
Activities like? Seeing that most activities have matchmaking, that would just make it a "i don't play with friends", not "i'm able to finish stuff solo" title, with the first option not really being worth a title compared to how Bungie designed titles in the first place.
---
It would make sense to have a title with the solo triumphs of shattered throne, pit of heresy and such things; but the issue with that is that there's simply not enough by far to build a title out of currently. Do keep in mind titles should either take long to collect/grind, or be rather hard to do (like raid titles), they really shouldn't just be extended name plates.
---
Completing set tasks. If you go over to the triumphs tab from your inventory they're those golden shield looking things. Click or select them to see the tasks, getting a title usually takes a few weeks normally due to the nature of the tasks being weekly
---
Man, up until recently I never had this problem. **Never**. It seems like the matchmaking has shit the bed for both strikes and Crucible. 
---
(No, I do not have a strict or moderate NAT. I updated my port triggering when the game moved to Steam)
---
Its neither A nor B , I'm only complaning that on my way to just finish the quest without caring about win or loss or k/d I hurt my teammate ranking and others might be doing the same thing just to finish.  Since people really care about their comp rank, if I'm playing to win I wouldn't want to go with someone who HAS to get kills in specific way or just die and doesn't care.   I'm not sure how this is not clear, why you think I complain about me? 
---
I'm alright , I'm fine , I don't care about my k/d when I'm in quest or if I lose all together to just tick some boxes.
---
I love it, now that I got a Blasphemer with quickdraw/max range it’s my favorite loadout
---
&gt;Isn't the character you play in portal called Shell 
---
Almost; She's called Chell!
---
Although the cores from Portal2 are pretty similar to ghosts!
---
So should I buy Shadowkeep when the new seasonal pass releases?
---
Nope. I really like the “man with no name” Western vibe that they’ve given him.
---
Is this Xol or wtf is it?

Major thing that annoys me is that you can not find a version of "For the Dancing and the Dreaming" without the interruption from Gobber.
---
Again it doesn’t really matter, if you buy it now with the season pass you still have the season pass for next season. If you can I would say just buy it now so you can get some of the loot from the battle pass thingy
---
Just get the not on my watch medal, all I can tell ya
---
Bruh I just read this a Nova bomb. I got and extra chromosome I swear.
---
You never have need of an enhancement core to farm but yes they were masterwork cores
---
If people care that much about their rank in PvP they need to reavaluate their life .
---
So chill and do your quests my friend...
---
some sea creature idk... it could be a worm though
---
Strikes are still 750 light. One shotting an enemy there isn't really much. Bungie needs to at Legendary Strikes like D1 had.
---
Ok redditard

Has to be before 10 seconds passes.
---
You obviously weren't here in d2 vanilla
---
I was having to solo Insight Terminus NF this week because I wanted my perfect roll on The Long Goodbye and *no one* was farming it on the 150k+ LFG server. 
---
I reeeeeeeeally miss having Heavyweight on the card..... At least I got my roll, minus the correct masterwork.
---
Ok ifunnytard
---
There's a medal somewhere you can eyeball. You need the one for denying an invader. To get it you do have a timeframe of killing them and it also must be before they kill any teammates. I got it with a bow, so it doesn't need to be a handcannon. Not sure the timeframe offhand, but I'm pretty sure its 5-10 seconds. You definitely don't have long.
---
wrong number
---
Ppsh?
---
Whatever number you think is fair.
---
All without someone in your fireteam:
---
Win a 1000 crucible matches
---
Complete a 1000 strikes
---
Etc
---
You have to kill an invader before they kill anyone on your team and it has to be within 10 or 15 seconds of them invading. You should get a medal called “Not on my watch” if you do it correctly
---
Its worded wrong you actually need to kill an invader right after they invade to your side learn the teleport points and be aware of where your team is they will spawn on the opposite side as you and your team
---
It's not really
---
Much appreciated
---
THAT WAS AMAZING GUARDIAN!
---
Man I sure hope English isn’t your first language
---
*Grunts in Caveman*
---
Yes I do
---
Bullshittt
---
I am still strugling with a good shader for the ship. I think i am on 7th now
---
Those aren’t solo though
---
Nice job most of the community complained about it, but  I love my bad juju with its catalyst a gun that rewards my super yes please
---
Is that even possible on console?
---
Great, thanks for the info.
---
Outbreak Perfected
---
Everyone goes into freelance knowing the odds. 
---
It’s like playing the lottery.
---
Point is you working quests doesn’t affect your teammates capability to conserve glory.
---
- I’ve dropped from legend to 4600 playing freelance but I knew that ahead of time, I don’t expect the team to pair me with a win everytime in a freelance playlist.
---
- likewise, if you’re that concerned about other players nothing is stopping you from finding two other people who are also working quests and aren’t there to win..... but he thing is, now that you’re working with a group to achieve the same goal your odds have winning just increased 👍
---
Queensbreakers bow
---
Dunno, the only "positive" modifier you can add now is the singe.
---
I mean technically if you're doing it for score, they're not nearly as rewarding as Match Game or Blackout. But still, I think they did it to prevent farming, but that's speculation.
---
*puts two blue engrams around your head* "WHAT ARE YOU?"
---
"An idiot sandwich."
---
I would too.  I can’t believe the Joy most in the community showed when he was replaced.
---
I would pay for Peter Dinklage
---
Not sure. I think only the legendary and powerful frames count. The blue research frames dont
---
Also likes to wear dresses?
---
Good news! You can do that. 
---
However, it requires creating an entirely new character.
---
My friend has gotten 4 exotic world drops (that I know of. He plays way more than me because I have to go to work) in the past 2 weeks, and he has cross-save enabled. So it's not that. ^(I have gotten 2 in the same time frame, and also have cross-save enabled.)
---
Good that's what i wanted to hear.
---
It's \[current year\] white knighting is gay.
---
kthxbye
---
Can you send proof of the blue usage and the top ~0.8%? Not that I don't trust you but that's a bold claim on both fronts
---
I finally got my Izanagi's yesterday and I'm late to catching up. My problem now is needing 22,000 damn imperial coins to max out my chalice so I can do the  heroic menagerie for the catalyst.  Feels bad man.
---
Good luck with your grinding
---
Oh come on 😟
---
Resilience is immensely important in PVP though. I almost don't want to share because I feel like it's neglected outside of competitive and don't want to spread what I think should be meta.
---
Not 100 resilience though. Rank 4-6 is most beneficial and few instances where 7 is needed.
---
lol all of them clanning up for a random game so adorable
---
Yep
---
Logically the colors for the dark spectrum would be red, yellow, and green to fill in the gaps on the light spectrum
---
Hahaha
---
This triumph was really annoying to complete. Ggs man.
---
Your enemies can’t kill if they’re dead!
---
Oof. That respawn death though
---
I wish that was the case for me. Just yesterday I dismantled 3 edge transits.
---
Plz tell me this is an actual ghost shell!!!!!!?????
---
But... electricity and ice aren’t the same thing
---
Indeed!
---
Fair enough, thought ou were going to use it to torment people in Crucible. May RNGesus be by your side.
---
How do even spot a new light ? I don't pay attention
---
He can’t help it. He’s time &amp; space challenged
---
Go watch a video 100 recovery makes a huge difference compared to other stats
---
My favorite so far was EpsteinDidntKillHimself
---
Yeah I'll be on in like an hour :) I'll add you then!
---
Even nastier with wormgod and bottom tree
---
What if they had a Portal Ghost Collection? You get Wheatley, the Space core, and the Adventure core?  
---
SPACE SPACE! SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!!
---
Inaugural Address.

It's just so damn perfect. *And the sound it makes...*
---
Yeah I would really like sunsinger back. Ran that all the time.
---
My Titan brother just ate a blue and a yellow crayon... awaiting the results now.
---
Same here, i got it on my second run on the same day.
---
Awesome thank you. I thought the barrel looked like a ppsh but wasn’t totally sure
---
I wasn't too keen on bows till I found an Arsenic Bite with Explosive head, Rampage, and a draw time masterwork.  Fell in love.
---

I'm a new light

I don't know what is the izanagi

But I'm 949
---
I don't care about the other titles. They don't encompass me and how I enjoy playing Destiny. I don't know where you are getting your info for the intended prerequisites on the titles but it can be whatever Bungie wants it to be.
---
A ton of these titles are earned just from people doing activities a million times till RNG favors them, so don't act like they aren't already participation trophies. 
---
You just decided you would be butt hurt about this for no reason. It's a good idea. Let people play how they want. If you earned this title by accident, then you don't have to wear it.
---
I would wear a Solo title with pride.
---
They did it to my poor dinkle-bot 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Just add a kinetic subclass lmao
---
I already have a couple Alienwares that could run it, I just don’t have any friends on PC and I know my friends wouldn’t make the switch :(. I’ll give it a try nonetheless
---
Dude I ain't like that I stay away from op stuff in crucible lol
---
LoL.
---
Mayhem
---
Guardian laughs and fires Deathbringer over the head of Captain.
---
Captain makes no sound while casually teleporting around the falling orbs of inadequacy.
---
Guardian instantly dies.
---
I fear no man but that... thing... it scares me.
---
Must be nice being paid to do something once every 3 months
---
I hope that we never get in the same Gambit lobby together
---
Hit me up when your on.
---
I have one that lays on my mouse arm and another that always walks in front of the monitor at the worst time, like during the jumps in Whisper.... 
---
Gotta luv cats to put up with it and I do!
---
Bungie did the same thing in D1 with the Ghallahorn.  They had Xur sell it and a couple weeks later they nerfed Ghallahorn.
---
Dont get it,  wheres snoop?
---
Because it’s never on y’all’s end, right? Always the fault of the game being funky and not  your internet connection being just bad atm
---
More fun to poop out

It’s possible to make jokes about homosexuality without being homophobic
---
Yeah those are shit weapons in comparison. I don’t know why people like claws of the wolf so much; I have an outlaw kill clip roll on mine but it just never feels nice to shoot.  I like GoS one way better.
---
I just need the ship but I honestly can't be fucked to go back to normal Gambit to grind for it
---
Lol, WTF is that movie? Is this what being on drugs feels like?
---
I was merely listing enemies like you asked, not that i was against the glitch or how important the boss was. 
---
I don't like gambit but clearly it must be played a lot if thats still here and Srl isn't ( which was apparantly also an unplayed gamemode)
---
They would need to sell an absurd amount of those shells to make it a worthy investment
---
Yes.  My cat has booped the power button on my console before while playing.
---
In your moms anus
---
Ok boomer
---
Pretty sure it's just not losing any motes. You should he fine to die if you don't have any
---
where do i get upgrade packages from?
---
Facts on that but in the end, it’s worth it.
---
They come after public events.
---
Everybody gangster until Imhotep walking again
---
Eris here.
---
You’re acting like a spoiled brat, and this is the only present under the tree. There was a lot more than this one activity to this season. But I’m not going to change the mind of someone who just did it for the memes.
---
Can confirm, Forfeit’s great for the new dungeon, especially in the Ogre section.
---
At vendors, like giving banshee gun parts or giving shaxx crucible tokens. Idk if all vendors give mods but I know banshee and shaxx do.
---
&gt;The titles but it can be whatever Bungie wants it to be.
---
Which is why they aren’t what you suggested
---
&gt;A ton of these titles are earned just from people doing activities a million times till RNG favors them
---
Only wayfarer, and that was my exact point we don’t need a surge of arbitrary titles that are worthless. We already have the forsaken titles that are participation awards. (Except for Rivensbane)
---
&gt;You just decided you would be butt hurt about this for no reason. 
---
You’re the only one here getting angry
---
&gt;If you earned this title by accident, then you don't have to wear it.
---
If something can be done on accident it shouldn’t be a title
---
&gt;I would wear a Solo title with pride.
---
Get wayfarer or equip then. They aren’t making a matchmaking title.
---
It’s because he was wrong, and his answer should be downvoted to signify that it is false Information
---
I wasn’t already invading, we were being invaded.
---
As long as I'm getting paid enough glimmer I'd fight for either.
---
The resilience mods only go in that very first slot of the armor. You have a choice of which stat to buff, or a handful of other options there.
---
If you are under 950, don't worry. Just get higher light and worry about it later. Resilience is good, but not great.
---
Bottom line get a good connection?
---
Nice one kid, keep making lame posts
---
Leviathans breath is good even for not unstoppable champions. Are there better? Hell yeah but there’s something satisfying about watching strike bosses take a hefty 40k or instaphase and be staggered.
---
Man I'm right there with you, Gambit is so enjoyable, especially when getting four kills and Drifter is so excited like wooooooooo hahaha.
---
Ah. Ok. The reason I have been trying is I have been playing gambit lately and just have been murdered lately lol. But I’ll try that and see how it goes. Thanks.
---
I banked 75 without dying but dyed on  primeval never counted
---
I agree with oem, but recluse is gonna be trash on console due to having much more recoil than pc. Bungie makes changes based off of pc destiny and screw over console players.
---
luv u &lt;3
---
No, I don't want any more of that trash infesting raids and comp.
---
Forsaken starts in the Tangled Shore, towards the bottom of the map.
---
I would like to see it come around at least once a month with Iron Banner.
---
Get the quest from Drifter and complete the triumph "Notorious Hustle."
---
no
---
I run that with a Dust Rock Blues a lot.
---
I would pay for this
---
Tomorrow noob
---
Ye I’ll wait for next seasonal pass
---
Imagine if a QTE popped up and whoever completed it first made their nova eat the other nova to form one giant fuck you nova
---
love it man. large props
---
I don't run Blink with nova bomb
---
Farm gos but get to boss then keep resetting checkpoint helps, pit of heresy, ordeal nightfall
---
Momentum control was what got me through the quest
---
Nightfall 100,000 score, master difficulty nightmare hunts, weekly Pit of Heresy completion, and Iron Banner this coming week
---
Dude when I run with my usual fireteam I'm always having to babysit the hunter who exists in a perpetual state of high-as-balls. Sometimes also need to babysit the warlock depending on which of the two is running. One of them does a pretty good job keeping himself alive, the other one likes walking off cliffs. You're lucky you get to play not-support.
---
I like Nova Warp, not sure all the hate here on it. I feel like people definetly tend to use the mobility increase it gives you pretty poorly, which I can't argue with but that doesn't make the super bad, just has a high skill ceiling.
---
For those who are about to make a comment about my rank, it was earlier this season when I was getting Recluse
---
Ohhh
---
all the above. plus iron banner when it comes back for the last week, legend rank in glory.
---
tyvm :)
---
Ps4
---
That's no moon...
---
Dude, some of us are just over here trying to drag our hunter buddies out of the latest chasm he fell into while trying to chase something shiny.
---
These things keep getting less and less funny. How long did it take you to come up with this kernel of comedic genius?  10 seconds?
---
Hive, bring a sword. Seriously though, a sword with an uppercut can stall/push back the nightmares just enough to get help or keep them off the point.
---
I played survival freelance to get mine only took a few games it’s like 3% per win in comp/banner and like 1% per quick match
---
Yeah uhh no. That would beat the purpose of invasions. But they do need to fix it back to the way it was before Shadowkeep. If one team had a primeval, they weren't able to invade until the other team had the primeval as well. Now they can just invade whenever, that's bullshit.
---
Best all around rifle. It's worth it!
---
Wait wait wait. D2 Has higher light level strikes? Even on the map, when I look they're still 750. How do I find those?
---
its so sad that it had been nerfed to the fucking ground
---
Im using Ceberus to Grind it out (rlly nice for multikills)
---
Exotic perk: Gives your Ghost a british accent
---
We going for the lowest effort memes now?
---
Another future leviathan related quest
---
I think he yells at me enough the way it is. I don't need my ghost telling me to throw more grenades lol
---
The scout kills really were a momentum control thing. Although 150 scouts can 3 tap, so those might be your best bet
---
The only scenario where Izanagi's is going to do more damage than Whisper is if the DPS window is sub six seconds. Whisper does far more total damage than Izanagis, and is a far better weapon for 99% of the encounters in game.
---
Hence, it's a worse gun. Pretty sure even Tranquility with Firing Line will do more total damage, and you can pair that with Whisper. Big numbers don't always mean good weapons, unless you can one shot something and bypass an immunity phase Whisper is always going to be king.
---
Yea, i was playing for a couple of hours and was only at 39%, but tbh, comp freelance to me was easier to win than control or sth. Have never played Iron Banner before so i guess i‘ll see tomorrow
---
U should add me lol

---
That’s what nightfalls are supposed to be.
---
750 is the normal strike.
---
From there nightfalls have 4 difficulties up to 980 which is master level.
---
Having a “legendary strike” would be pointless considering that is what nightfalls are.
---
Yes they do dude, i just did it last week.. ANY frame counts.
---
Likewise! Started from the original spawning area and then jumped to the European Dead Zone right away. Way confusing and hard to tell what was going on!
---
Bad mod :(
---
That wasn't bright dust wasn't it? Also isn't the best going to be something like Guiding Light and Treasure Hunter?
---
This is why they should stop releasing quests with steps that incentivize not playing the mode objective. People are going to prioritize finishing unpleasant quests with cool rewards quickly, over trying to win the crucible match, even if it drags down their team.
---
What i need to do after i complete shattered throne to get the sniper
---
agreed. BUT... to some people, $25 on a shirt is a lil expensive.
---
You know...I never actually noticed. He's just fucking gone.
---
I don’t think so. You can’t use it to cheat as far as I know.
---
The chest and cape will be available in the last 2 weeks of the season. The other three have already been available for bright dust, so yeah, you missed the grips and boots.

I’m confused how am I suppose to post it??
---
I enjoy loaded question too much to use the recluse all the time. Been running exit strategy and loaded question lately and it's a lot of fun. I don't do raids though so maybe it's not useful there.
---
Agh, imo it makes it even better.
---
i play on 8 sens and i use kontrolfreeks to get more precise turning. also, the head hitbox is much larger than you’d think
---
If it works for you then by all means. I have my own preferences as does everybody else. Just because it isn't new or meta doesn't make it bad

You can try for new drops of your favorite armor.

But you don’t HAVE to change what you’re doing.

In carnage you'll bloom, like a flower in the dawn.
---
Epic may may but let's try to avoid any mentions of suicide here, it can be upsetting for some users.
---
Thanks!
---
Perfectly fine to use them.
---
In some cases they are better - I.e special ammo finder, heavy ammo finder, "impossible" combinations under armor 2.0 like HC targeting and pulse on which would not be allowed in armor 2.0 on a single piece
---
I run a Nightstalker with Tractor Cannon lol. It's the only way Mayhem is fun to me.
---
I know just saying the price
---
Wow you got to play with Longclaw! What a player. The lack of the Beloved ornament makes this clip trashhhh.
---
You are just assuming.
---
Nowhere does it state that if they make something themed it must be free to acquire from said themed location/event.
---
They just escaped from their publisher. They need revenue now more than ever. You need to drop any preconceptions you have, or of how people on the subreddit assume Bungie should distribute their products.
---
They will do what they need to in order to turn a profit each season, and i fully support it, as should anyone who enjoys the game.
---
Especially as all of the items in question are merely cosmetic.
---
I just saw something bright flying through the screen and had to clarify what it was... Turns out, was the other mate
---
If you repurchase from collections it will be 2.0 armor.  However, the stats are usually low end.  You should buy the fated engram from Xur each week to try to get better rolls (fated will drop with better rolls than what you can buy from him).
---
The question becomes do you have mods that you can put in the 2.0 armor that will make it better than the standard rolls it originally came with.  Which in most cases is yes.  If so then you want to get that 2.0 version because you can make it even better with mods.  If not play with what you have and try to get a 2.0 to drop or get the mods that would make it worth purchasing from collections.
---
Lmao after the first sentence I was like “....is he known?” Smh
---
Cool! r/huntersriseup
---
thanks for the ptsd
---
Um hello what do you need to do to get the quick fang. Cayde is dead so I don’t how to get him.
---
Oh yeah, with Lucky Pants on especially
---
The AC is basically a solar austringer, the pulse is nasty with a good roll, the sniper is good, the shotty tears, divinity is borderline op, the bow and fusion are kinda eh. How can be fun with WoL but the fusion is just bad imo.
---
The blue bar at the bottom is the video player timeline. This shows how much time is remaining. I'm sorry, please forgive me. Welcome to the game. I hope you're enjoying yourself.  :)
---
Happened to me today, it's weird
---
Not on reddit, in the game
---
It’s better that way
---
Lot idea
---
M'Fellow Hunter, r/huntersriseup
---
Ooooooh!!
---
Hey man, i have shadowkeep and i do think its dumb. For people who dont know, f2p players can do nightfall the ordeal normally, its just that if the  nightfall is the scarlet keep, you cant play it. So you dont have access to the materials/exotic farm for this week. However, you CAN get the scarlet keep in the strike rotation. I do think its dumb.
---
Double/triple infamy also double/triples your progress.
---
What's under the xbox?
---
We’re the Titian at
---
Hello, I am friendly Frank
---
I think it is stupid too but Im not really sure of a solution. Im afraid sales would drop if they removed it which would mean pay to win shit.
---
Or maybe they could just chill with the ducking commercials. I own the game and still sees commercials for it.
---
Yea, silver. Everytime u buy one ornament from tess, it reduces the silver price for the full set (I'm sure you've noticed). So my best bet would be to wait and pray if it will go on rotation, or at the last day or week, buy it using silver
---
A ps4 no judge please
---
like the hunter solar knives, but not explosive and its just a book
---
Akka, Eir, Ur, Xol, Yul. From Ghost fragment Gimble-4
---
Currently, Escape Plan feels quite well in that regard.
---
Ah good, the only place they belong!
---
Self revive was the bee's knees.
---
It definitely would be good in Crown of Sorrow, the whole way through. And the Levi-Raids.
---
My brother bought it with him to All-State band. Sorry if I didn’t provide context at the title, I was busy and didn’t have enough time to make a title.
---
Edit: It was a dare that our trumpet section leader made with my brother.
---
Couldn't upvote because then it would go to 7.0k but I have to say this is the best Ghost shell recommendation I know.
---
I mean, you dont have to do it. Dont do it if youre lazy, but at the same time theres nothing wrong if you want to do it. Theres really no right way to answer this lol.
---
In the TWAB they said that the effects of us defeating the boss haven’t become apparent yet so I’m assuming something big will happen before the end of the season.
---
For the hord?
---
Well, if you bought curse of osiris, you did.
---
AND THEY TASTE FUCKING DELICIOUS
---
Dont knock it till you've tried it.
---
It’s more of a principle thing. Anyone willing to wear something that ugly doesn’t deserve the Light of the Traveler
