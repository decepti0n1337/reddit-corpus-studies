I played solo queue and a russian dude was versus me : One of my team mate go DC and 2 minutes later I got DC too. COINCIDENCE ?  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

---
---
i got a real exotic in the adventure tho
---
Is titan skating only in pc?
---
They won’t bother fixing it until datto cries about it
---
They never did, and now that collections exist there’s no reason for Bungie to make them drop on dismantle
---
I don't like 3rd person. But the building mechanics are fun and unique.
---
That was me!
---
There no reason to not do it
---
It's a joke. Nobody meant for it to be offensive, so sorry if you took it the wrong way.
---
Yeah you're popular now welcome to the club of cool and funny kids. Please take a seat have some cookies and milk. No? Maybe some Cake? Milkshake? Soft drink? Tea?
---
How much.
---
:)
---
That’s it? You’re just going list off a bunch of places? Give me specific examples of how the US is solely responsible for fucking up these places. Because if that’s the case I guess we must assume that they were all utopias before big bad America came along. And while your quickly googling for an answer, google concentration camps and see what an actual concentration camp looks like.
---
Ok well Last Word is a bit broken (well its always been) so that's why people use it in the crucible. 
---

---
As for why people use handcannons, well I guess its personal preference. I like using 140rpm headcannons because it feels noice getting them headshots. And its all about the role too, like the Midnight Coup from the Levi Raid (Outlaw and Rampage) or Spare Rations (Rapid Hit and Multikill Clip). 
---
In summary, personal preference.
---
Friend!
---
You are dead! Not big soup rice
---
I find the weapons really inaccurate (the rifles especially, as a Halo/Titanfall player this annoys me to no end).  I dont even think it's a "your out of range" problem; that's just how they are.  If a scar could hit all its shots it kills in 4 shots, or less than a second (60 dmg headshot, 5.5 fire rate)
---
Because of this close range weapons are a nesseceity, the pump shotgun was 26% of elims in a game with dozens of weapons.  Same with smgs and other shotguns.
---
And this is an opinion, but there balance is *atrocious*.  They dont change anything, if its overpowered they vault it.  That's it.  Pump and Combat shotguns, mechs, port-a-forts, anything.
---
Its hilarious that they decided the pump was op and vaulted it, only to add in a shotgun with faster firerate, more range, more accuracy, twice the ammo, and it reloads 2 at a time.  What were they thinking when they added that last part?
---
The good part about fortnite is there amazing marketing.  I bought a battlepass, you bought a battlepass, we *all* bought a battlepass! Its legitimately impressive.
---
And even more so there creative.  It's like halo forge but *everyone* has it!  That's were I spend all time in fortnite.  Havent played br actively since  season 4.  Actually I exclusively remake maps from halo (custom &amp; stock) in creative in a special deathmatch mode I made.  When you remove the building and control the weapons added in you really start to notice the balance issues.
---
So theres my 2 cents spread across 6 paragraphs.  Your welcome for filling up your screen
---
Yeah 15,000 points I believe
---
They don't specify how hard though so I could lightly punch my best friend and get an easy 100k without doing any lasting damage AAAAND they can do the same and we both walk away with 200k combined
---
I save them for my hunter.
---
It's easier to use a hand cannon than a rifle when you're hopping all over the place.
---
What is this. A power rangers meetup?
---
I mean yeah. But it’s not hard. I still do raids every week with people on xbox. There isn’t a large community left. But it’s not hard to find a team. And you often find the same people or make new friends cause everyone who’s left loves the game. Making it kinda great. Crucible is empty though. But finding raid teams takes no time at all.
---
I got this ornament a while back while i was playing and it says i need to reach season rank 25. If i fucked up and that means season 3 rank 25 since i cant see any ranks rn, is it going to stay locked in my inventory forever now. Im asking since i did the other part that was 25 wins in iron banner and am confused why does it still show in my ornaments if i dont have it. Btw am going to ask support if they would pity me if i fucked up royally. Does anyone know if i can do anything to fix this?
---
I throw my cat all the time. She finds it fun. I toss her onto the bed and she runs back uo and jumps on the chair. Goes on for like 5 minutes
---
This angers me
---
scout rifles that camp in the back of the map
---
You can always buy shadowkeep.
---
I dunno, man. I don't think the open world PVP is the main problem; I think GTA Online also actively encourages people to be as big of a dick to others as possible. (e.g. getting a portion of victim's money when you kill them, allowing people to put bounties on other players, having mini games where you straight up have to kill as many other players as possible...). The game is a cancer to online community.
---
The grenade launcher part is the last step, and can be completed using smgs instead of a grenade launcher
---
No.
---
Boltcaster’s tag says $207
---
You can only co-op after the mission called ‘spark’ for story reasons.
---
Im confused, why did you take a SS of your phones screen with an ingame SS and post it? 
---
Why didnt you just post the SS itself without SSing your phones screen too?
---
Do any of you even know the characters in this meme? Your stealing from the wrong game idiots.
---
Selling for $200
---
Great video!
---
what im trying to say is that it’s just not the same. the feeling of destiny 1 when it was still getting big updates and there was still a lot of hype amongst players, no matter what, just wont be the same.
---
That's me on every month
---
They pay me to lead, not read. Haha.
---
But for real, this is a huge mistake.
---
I can see the game falling off if your friends leave. That’s what I’m worried about. It’s not a game meant to be played by yourself.
---
Yeah, but you don't abuse her, that's more of a playful context than anything
---
Really does...
---
Maybe open 25 IB level up packages. I had a similar problem with the season 3 gauntlet last season. I’m not sure what i did but i was able to use the ornament.
---
I agree. It’s sucks. But kinda is cool now that the fan base of players who love it are left.
---
How it feels when you saved your super for the whole pvp match and use it and the very end
---
Oh, I have every intention to. I still haven’t finished free to play. Just saving up for it
---
!remindme 1 week
---
Hey guys I want to get into raids but need a crew. Just finished forsaken.
---
I can get into orbit and try to travel to a destination but then it will give me error code lettuce and kick me back to orbit. Been like this since the update earlier.
---
Got it, thank you!
---
Fucking hell....well I paid 100 for my ace.... we'll talk when I have spending money
---
Destiny is a great community
---
They’re not the exact same modes though?
---
"Welcome to the Leviathan"
---
Do a different mode
---
The Fabulous Five and the Outcast
---
fixed it uninstalling it and reinstalling it
---
100% certifiable badass
---
Wholesome
---
Hug is an emote? Is that new?
---
So 6v6 control isnt the same as 6v6 control?
---
"A rogue warlock shot the Earth with chaos reach out of frustration and accidentally ignited a huge deposit of alien crystals called Tiberium. The incident caused a giant chain reaction and reduced all of Europe into a wasteland covered by lethal green crystals and radioactive storms. The shattered pieces of crystals spread through space signalling an ancient Aliens race million light years away that Earth is now mature enough to harvest.  
---
I literally copied the latter half of the lore from Command and Conquer because this is what happened in that game
---
Or a different game!!
---
Lmao fuze and the hostage
---
Meh I'll stick to contraverse holds
---
Yay!
---
Last word or night watch scout/pulse rifle and  .. subjective smg is pretty good beloved or sole survivor snipe once in awhile hand cannon..  only time i used a shotty was to get the exotic shotty cant member name never a nade launch or fusion rifle..
---
It was pretty sweet. I was working a table most of the day I was there (Sunday) but the vendors had a bunch of cool stuff
---
Do the shotgun slider players use macros? seems like they do for their slides
---
6v6 control isn’t the exact same as 6v6 control with light level advantages and zone lockouts.
---
Well they want to help the OEM recluse sweat gyms
---
What do you mean by that like as in do shotgunners have micro pen15’s I do believe so
---
That is f2p. All pinnacles are available to everyone
---
This catalyst is actually easy I just did 750 nightfall
---
Other than day one issues that everyone had, I haven’t had any connection issues.
---
Am reckoner and dredgen, can confirm. Finished Exit Strategy and the banner already this season. See gambit next season when I have to go in again.
---
What is the game mode called?
---
Iron Banner
---
That might be the game telling you something about your life. You fucking baboon
---
I will never willingly try for another massacre medal the rest of my destiny career unless it's for a ritual weapon or banner or other seal related tasks.
---
This is correct
---
Yeah I figured maybe it'd smoothen out by now .... also im in ps4..
---
Thats an event.
---
Reminds me of the giant blacksmith from dark souls. :(
---
You said it perfectly bro. This whole comment needs to be seen by bungo
---
All I can say is Destiny really do be like that sometimes.
---
&gt; . After a titan kills the marked (wall hacked) opponent they instantly get a full health regeneration and an overshield.
---
Wow!! That's absolutely ridiculous. Why is that even in the game? Literally any other fps with an item like this would drive off the player base. Especially since not everyone can get it.
---
They grow up so fast
---
Well there are far more titan and hunters then warlocks.. also this is my opinion and my personal experience and what been told from other titans i mean i never said all do them things i have ran into alot
---
Im on pc, but my tip for you is to find people to play with. There are many third-party websites for finding groups in Destiny, including r/Fireteams and the Destiny 2 companion app. Destiny is a lot more fun when you find fun people to play with.
---
So it’s that kinda day huh?
---
Beauties.
---
Ohh wendigo should be on there then lol
---
Ah okay, thanks!!
---
After you, shower door is that way -&gt;
---
Also i keep wanting to try jade but for one resaon or another i havent.. 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
---
If you have Shadowkeep you will learn about them later.
---
Near as I can tell after the fact is that my melee in super countered the boss knockback
---
Aside from finding others to play with as FlyingAlpaca said, I suggest playing through the Year 1 campaigns.  Talk to Amanda Holiday in the tower hangar for the quests that will let you play them.
---
I have been getting hair in places I've never had before...
---
It should be. The blinding light shots do more damage than the spike gl’s im pretty sure
---
Your submission has been removed. We do not allow indirect screen captures. Please take a screenshot and try again. 
---
If you're going to post gameplay video or screenshots, please make sure it is not from a phone or similar recording, and is a direct capture, thanks!
---
PC for me.
---
Yes, those worthless internet points.
---
Started the game when forsaken went free for that short while. Had never seen an exotic engram. Just thought it was an obviously trapped engram.
---
Gally was mine. Did all the activities that gave high chances for exotics every week and could never get it. Finally Xur sold it and they nerfed it like 2 weeks later.
---
I just feel that recluse is known for the chain killing and it wouldn’t be recluse anymore
---
What did he say?
---
Bruh
---
You got like another two months.
---
Thanks for clarifying all this stuff. It looks like I've still got some grinding to do before taking on this mission again. I didn't expect Nightfall to be tough.
---
I mean, bottom tree striker isn't going to last long enough to kill you twice unless he wipes your entire team or you get really unlucky with spawns.
---
Oh my god... I need that raze lighter 🤤
---
Skullfort made my most used weapon be Melee, followed by Super.
---
Jumping high in the air and crashing down at everything is so much fun.
---
But the changes your proposed would also remove that factor, this change makes it a shutdown weapon not something you can 7th column with.
---
You’re right about that or maybe Ikora and Eris might put a spell on the vex gate to prevent vex from coming out from the other side but allows guardians to enter in and out of it ( just a guess)
---
Should of been "Crippling Depression"
---
I Liked the fake without knowing and I scrolled back and unliked it, Sonic says that’s no good.
---
So you bought all of them, right?
---
*This is amazing*
---
doesnt matter how well I play objective if my opponents are gods
---
K you made me go and zoom in now I’m pissed that the Raze Lighter is mid-named.
---
I also had this experience honestly taking a break for a few weeks and then coming back feels so nice and refreshing
---
just started... so does everyone just rush through everything as fast as possible in this game?
---
Way to go sexualising a nice story about about a mother saving her daughter! 👍
---
Watermark all the things.
---
His cloak is hanging near Amanda holiday
---
/r/Fireteams
---
That’s Ada, not Ada-1. Ada-1 is a robot
---
also add
---
NPC Eververse does not see the purchase of this add-on, I just checked
---
*Sits with my 6 resets I got the first month and a half of forsaken*
---
“I don’t see why everyone hates gambit so much.”
---
My nickname FoggyDia
---
I'm probably going to take a longer break. Usually I'm worried about getting the loot that's exclusive to that season but now I'm just not feeling it. I have to spend more of my time focused on my studies. I'll be missing out on some cool seasonal ranks armour but that's ok.
---
What's the new light version? Who is competitive?
---
I love it though
---
I actually thought about that one but I already saw someone else with it so I decided to pick something I haven't seen used yet.
---
Shame
---
Welcome to my world
---
Would be super funny if there was a 1 in 1,000 chance of them all being legit engrams.
---
I say this to my self all the time in swbf2 hvv. But sometimes you gotta think to yourself that maybe you are the bad teammate 😔. it's alright just try your best.
---
New light is the free version.
---
By competitive i meant it will never be as strong unless you can get oem.
---
\*I don't believe what I'm seeing!\*
---
This happened to me today. Super pissed
---
yo what?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I've never payed for a light boost and I'm projecting to hit 960 by the end of the night.
---
If you visit Ada-1 she has a quest for it as well as Jhotunn
---
I want you to take a real good look through the Eververse store and come back to us on that light boost thing.
---
Yup. The OP was from /u/Lynx-Uganda
---
It finally came down to running void titan with full reaper points (one coin) and doomfang pauldrons with double shield throw.
---
You essentially get to throw infinite shields, you have a damage bonus after your first yellow, and just throw until everything dies.
---
When I finally got that banner I wanted to dismantle all the gear but I knew I would need it again. Low and behold it helped with exit strategy. Lol.
---
Hahaha great
---
Destiny 2 has a new starting point. You do the new intro mission and then have access to the tower
---
Thank you
---
Thank you!!!
---
I saw a few people below 900, poor souls.
---
You can but it’s rng. I got a fighting lion from Asher today
---
We should also Scorn people who blatantly steal memes like this.
---
It's a bug, you have to do smg kills :)
---
Bungie twitters it :)
---
I read that in Shaxx’s voice and yeh I jus got the iron banner set!!
---
Random drop, or wait for Xur to sell it.
---
Because it’s seen as a scummy class, where hunters take a bit more game sense, and don’t have a rift, or a 1hk charging grenade (warlocks), don’t have a 1hk melee that is a free kill, ect, they are generally seen as the skill character
---
there is a glitch. use sub machine guns
---
Ok reimburse me
---
Which crucible games are the ones for "comp" or glory rather.
---
Play some freelance my guy. I'm not very good at PvP either but I managed to do it in just a few hrs.  Plus, you'll get the extra practice along the way. I used the refrain 23 (a hecking blue auto rifle with rampage and ricochet) that I pulled from my collection and it did honestly very sell given the ranges you're often fighting at.
---
I did that already tho
---
Eh, depending on where you live, it usually is okay. Amazon has very good service when it comes to quality of transport. I can totally understand your hesitation though!
---
Just...why? What's even the point?
---
Git gud.
---
Omg it worked thanks
---
I hate most of the titan armor. I feel like I'm about to play futuristic football not kill an army.
---
https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/confession-of-hope-part-one
---
https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/confession-of-hope-part-two
---
Maybe check these. Not sure tho
---
Sickening really
---
Survival.
---
Just saw that the quest has wrong icons and text. It should be submachinegun kills
---
Yes they are they have a battle pass that contains literal pay to win items.  They weren't like that under Activision.  They also lock content behind a season pass which is a new low.  Shadowkeep is all recycled content from destiny one with some shiny new strikes and lost sectors. This games still as disappointing as it was release day.
---
i’m not there yet, but somebody in my clan posted a screen shot from bungie saying the grenade portion is glitched and use smg.
---
Any news on why it changed? Did everyone have to resupply their gear ,etc..? Again I just started playing again after a while away from games.
---
Only exception I can otherwise think of is if you got good stats on an exotic. Like I'm one of the rare hunters that use bows, so I got a decent Oathkeeper I put energy into because I can just infuse later if I need to.
---
Cant you just use your mountaintop?
---
Legit had someone gesture me towards them, I complied and was prompted for a high five, it was awesome and really made my day. We had just owned the vanguard strike on hero (920 light)
---
np. glad it worked. spread the word
---
8 to be exact
---
Hit Fabled 1 and win 100 games in any crucible setting.  Comp games are worth 3 while valor modes are worth 1.  Pretty sure IB matches are worth 2.
---
It took me and my friends like a hour to defeat the boss
---
How most fights end
---
It's ok nobody talks on pc either. Not thru voice nor text. Console is missing out on nothing (I've played both ps and console)
---
thats appalling it takes the hour it does to update
---
Tbh I've never had real issues with level advantages. The Last Word did just fine in previous IB and now with similar SR it shouldn't even be that bad.
---
Is a topic in Aztecross‘ iron banner video, too. https://youtu.be/2UR-Xh4z4us
---
*crying*
---
I guess flashpoint vendors can reward exotics?
---
it’s an interesting idea in pve but there is enough issues with lag in crucible. probably don’t need that on top
---
Thanks. Going to go for it after I finish IB on my other 2.
---
:(
---
I'm only 917, it's hard but still fun. Don't want to miss out on all those extra powerful rewards
---
I play mostly close to midrange.
---
He also doesn't have an account anymore
---
im doing the iron banner quest and just trying to get the pulse kill but i keep getting kill im crying over here
---
Dmg them with GL and finish off with something else its currently bugged.
---
Bagging is one of the scummiest things you can do and youll only do it with the intention of getting hatemail to show your friends and be like "lol i dindu nuffin" and he is also using recluse which makes bagging even worse. If OP used something that required some form of skill to use and outplayed that ape bagging wouldnt be as bad. But bagging while using one of the easiest to use and strongest guns in the game is scummy.
---
I mean it's not that bad. I played a ton last night at 908 power and was able to keep up just fine while also completing Scour the Rust
---
Yeah we got it, thanks for the info guys I'm just gonna close this now
---
You will though. Good luck getting all those grenade kills or pulse kills when your pulse does 10 to the head and the grenade does 20 damage.
---
Flying is for droids.
---
2 hours 7 minutes
---
Holy shit
---
the fact that he even took the image from the guy, the least he could have done is make it himself
---
Good strategy to prevent a wipe is to have a teammate go to the back of the boss room to a spot they can’t be reached by enemies and act as a “safeguard” that way you can die and respawn as much as you want without worrying about restarting
---
ok
---
Fortnite BR Killed Fortnite the PvE Game.
---
Ok
---
Do you think that’s what this is?
---
The image is grenade launcher, and the text says super. Really, just use an smg.
---
Thanks. My primary is definitely weaker but is only requiring one more shot than normal. Like I said, hard but not oppressive.
---
Way of the Outlaw, the Bottom Path Tree, is good for If your aiming is.. subpar. As long as you can land even a body shot, you get a bullet back. Or try the Middle Path Tree with Blade Barrage. Look in an Enemy's general area and.. let em rip.
---
Hmmm true but I think we’re just being over speculative lol
---
FINISH HIM!
---
FATALITY!
---
Heck yeah, It’s the perfect addition for shelves with gaming merch too. I need to find a place to set up my stuff again as I moved not too long ago.
---
Too little too late. She will forever be the unenthusiastic handjob of the vanguard. And she looks like a drag queen without a wig.
---
This was funny before steam names were a thing.
---
First time?
---
Totally balanced
---
Well...maybe I'll give it a shot this weekend.
---
I didn’t see this post before I posted damn near the exact same thing lol. Spent all my tokens.
---
Yes you can use them on other armor again. Once you have a mod it will stay unlocked
---
F
---
English MF, Do you speak it?
---
Random guardian hugs are the best
---
I have Forsaken and play Titan. OEM bad
---
But also, would rather use Sanguine Alchemy+empowering rift or Spectral Blades if I want the GPS coordinates of players. Would also rather use top tree Sentinel for its overshield than OEM for overshield.
---
But really though, OEM never seems to work for me anyway. Whether or not I even get the perk is iffy, and even if I do, the healing/overshield generates slower than if I just don’t get shot. Damage perk really doesn’t matter, it barely exists.
---
My god, you’re right 🤭
---
[removed]
---
It says grenade launcher kills.
---
the legend himself
---
Yeah my thought was the same but needed confirmation. Our fireteam leader accidentally going to orbit as he was leaving not knowing he's the fireteam leader.
---
Ummm no. In fact they tell you if you are getting a boost such as if you buy a ghost from the shop it specifically states what it will do and that the boost is not noticeable. Other than that the whole shop is purely cosmetics.
---
There is new armour?
---
No, all different.
---
You used "wat"...
---
Argh, thank you!
---
I am most jealous
---
Alrighty. I'm gonna do as much as I can here.
---
So, to answer your question about Shadowkeep. Yes it's worth it. I'd even try and find a way to grab forsaken as well. The story it adds is really nice to have. 
---
As for 900 light and what gear you should have. Keep blues. Even if they look yucky, they're still gonna be better light level. If you like purples, save them in your vault. The destiny 2 app is good for this because you can instantly transfer stuff from character to vault with ease. Eventually you'll gain season pass ranks and other sources for upgrade modules and you can then move onto getting a good gear score. Mods and enhancement cores are pretty important. Try and save for a gear set you want. Go for benefits best suited for your Warlock. Base your setup off of your super and your play style. Right now, solar mods are not in the artifact so try and get used to Nova bomb and look into the benefits of top tree vs bottom tree (I don't play warlock). I'd look at good warlock artifact mods and try and build around a meta. 
---
On regards to getting better gear though, yours going to want to grind powerful challenges. These are your weekly challenges that you'll get from the basic vendors. Zavala will have you complete bounties or Shaxx will have you complete boy ties in the crucible. Stuff like that will give you gear to work with. Another good way is to grind comp. You'll get good gear and losing doesn't take away glory until 2100.
---
Hope this helped. If I missed things, sorry.  I'd look up metas online for pve or pvp. That might help better.
---
Good luck to you. Also joining a clan is smart to do. You'll get more rewards doing things with them.
---
That OC is from almost a year ago though.
---
Cool. thanks!
---
*flashbacks to grinding on the moon*
---
How can I choose different nightfall to play?
---
Pretty sure she said it’d be a 1-way portal, those do exist. Like some of the Lost Sectors on Nessus, you go in the portal and come out standing in a red circle. Can’t go back in the red circle.
---
Ask yourself. Why not?
---
Go to Bungie's website and look for "Pc Migration" or something similar. There will be a transfer option though I don't know how this works because I moved straight to steam from PS4. Hope this helps
---
Oh god whatever shall i do i forgot an "h" now i can never understand what the word i spelled truly means oh noooooo
---
I guess the big thing I dont understand is why such a short dodge? It looks as though Icarus D. travels less than half as far as Hunter's dodge. Even if used near the floor to avoid most explosives, you still can be clipped by the blast.
---
It's  like a strange sidegrade to Blink that's part of the Way of the Sky package.
---
Normally I would say, "If it had a tad more range, or a bit less ADS recovery, I would use it over blink.", but I already use the Solar Warlock's ability to fire while gliding over blink despite liking blink (and loving the edible grenades!)
---
Yea so exactly what I just said...?
---
Don't be, lol. The armour is nice though, cool that you get it all for the quest rather than RNG.
---
Use Polaris Lance. Is great, it’s my main PvP weapon.
---
he can't, he deleted his account
---
Giggity
---
3 hours is a long time if you dislike PvP
---
The super bit has nothing to do with the grenade launcher kills actually being SMG kills.
---
Indeed. Digging the white
---
Use bloody tooth shader on it, looks sick!
---
Does he still get the karma?
---
The word "an" is only used prior to a word beginning in a vowel. 
---
"h" is not a vowel. 
---
Sorry bro.
---
Is your base light level 950 or does it include your bonus from the artifact?
---
Without artifact
---
I'll have to check it out once I for the armor on my second character
---
I remember this!
---
Pray for good RNG
---
It took me all of 6 hours of extremely leisurely playing the game to make level 900, and in the week since I’m now over 930 and again I’m not making it a main goal to increase my light level by any means. As a new light player with i can honestly say It really is not that hard at all to reach cap.
---
What's confusing me is I'm a higher light level, 5-10, than those I'm hitting and they're taking 2 hits like a champ. I'm taking one hit and I'm toast.
---
I'm a titan with 46 resilience if that helps anyone help me understand.
---
I don't think I get stats and need some help. Pvp when from fun to stupid infuriating.
---
No only crossave, ( you can play on the same account on different platforms of you own the game on them
---
I dont excatly remember what you have to do but it might have something to do qith the story of shadowkeep
---
Poor kid doesn’t apply to upvotes right?
---
I cant imagine why you didn't get your frame if all you had left was to do the forge and finish it up. I'm sorry to hear it bugged out on you and I'd say try one more time if the frame isn't gone from your inventory. Or make sure you didn't miss something thats stopping you from finishing it

I was supposed to get monte carlo but instead i got cerberus im not mad im just sad
---
“Im comin ace”
---
What else? Self esteem over some red points?
---
“Why not melee” laughs in insurmountable skullfort
---
I need more like you, bring me your friends
---
Because all friends who haven taken shadowkeep deluxe edition also received 4k silver
---
Are you going to be alright?
---
The whole quest disappeared 
---
So fucking pissed off
---
Vex Invasion is part of the Season , which is included if you buy Shadowkeep.
---
Played Crucible with Scrota yesterday evening. Gave me a good laugh when i saw that name in game. :D
---
99% it's a realistic amount to achieve, it make sense 🤔
---
It's fine as is. 
---
Btw: Gambit Invading has Light Level enabled as far as I know.
---
Guess I have to pull out my recluse that I don't have
---
That’d be a name
---
That's an odd glitch but frames are never super hard to farm out if you go run public events or ep. Usually has you done incredibly fast. And if you spent a ballistic log on it you can but it for the easier to gather black armory consumable until reset of the next week.
---
Check what perks are good and bad before you start sharding decent weapons
---
Honestly no idea. Just a guy with a funny name I think, but screenshots from other guardians with him have been popping up since Vex Offensive dropped.
---
The famous vex offender
---
It didn't start out for no reason. It was supposed to give players the Exotic sniper rifle called the IZANAGI'S BURDEN. But AssDA-1 won't give the quest step that allows us to progress any further.
---
Targeting is an arc helmet mod and reload is an arc gauntlets mod, no enhanced reload mod exists as far as I know
---
I would say that if you’re committed to using a pulse in a match then you could reasonably expect 5 of those 20 kills to be actual final blows. I know it sounds low and for some it may it a low estimate, but that’s my experience.
---
If they give you their idk account number or whatever it is then typing /join *number* works
---
It’s the essence of Insanity so if that nightmare hunt is available do it repeatedly till it drops or RNG from moon activities &amp; chests.
---
Swarm Of The Raven is lovely w/ Spike nades (well any aggressive frame with them is) from Iron Banner so could try farming those this week as well.
---
You will get to 900 very quickly by doing any activities since all gear drops increase your power up to the 900 power (soft cap), after this you should do weekly powerful challenges to increase your power.
---
im 1/25 after 10+ matches with a pulse rifle. I went 20+ in most of those matches.
---
Like steam url?
---
Fastest way would be to look for activities that have either daily or weekly challenges listed below them that award powerful gear. This is what will give you the power progression.
---
I know, you’ve said before. That’s why I think it might just be bugged for you.
---
I think the only one that’s “protected” is the fates Engram real close to the end.
---
Throw a grenade
---
a titan that doesnt run one eyed mask, recluse, mindbender or mountain top? you guys exist?! thank God! there’s still hope in humanity!
---
Usually they do multiple banner weeks in a season but yah nothing publicly announced for a second one
---
Don't think it is.. might be wrong..
---
Doesn't matter anyway I guess xd
---
What the fuck is this? Recording a screen with a phone? are we back in the 2000s? hell, even then we had fraps so this is just...
---
Please tell me you bought each of these and put them in your vault for a rainy day.
---
I think its /steamid or something on the destiny chat ingame to find your number you need to join others games. use this [https://discord.gg/UUvmex](https://discord.gg/UUvmex) lots of people looking for activities or groups  on this discord
---
Thank you for such detailed response! Can you please clarify about season transmogs, can i get transmogs from previous seasons?
---
Light Level advantage based hardcore control with a pursuit that as you complete it you obtain the exclusive armour for it.
---
A lot of fun usually (although the pursuit this season is a lot less fun &amp; diverse than last season).
---
Exactly.
---
Does Tess currently have the emote?
---
This could be because you didn't have the 3rd key by then I think everyone who didn't have the 3rd key before SK was affected... Anyways Bungie is "currently investigating the situation and is trying to solve the problem as soon as possible."
---
Kept trying and gave up.
---
Nah not quite. Just looked for it myself, it’s called a friend code. If you go to the add a friend part of your steam there should be a big ol number there. They’ll just have to tell you what theirs is and you can copy paste it into chat
---
Failed! Its "wolves"!!111!
---
Tree Wolves Quest Fire Bug!!11!1
---
Super lacklustre compared to last season, felt like a real satisfying grind before.
---
Yeah but it's the same image, which means he just took the meme, even if you don't finish funny its still theft
---
My post says 950 WITHOUT THE BONUS.
---
Thx its time to grind!
---
No, infusing basically means sacrificing a gun of higher light level to make it the same level. (E.g. sacrificing a 950 sniper to level a 800 hand cannon up to 950).
---
To do so, click on the gun then look at the bottom left corner with a bunch of boxes. Hover over them and u should see an option to infuse. Note that u would need an upgrade model (earned from banshee the gunsmith in the tower or through rewards) to do so
---
Ahh apologies I missed that
---
yeah all the scorched stuff is 0 light
---
Yep. Just checked and it’s like that for me as well.
---
Mistakes happen. I’m not perfect like you.
---
Did the tweet by bungie help?
---
No worries
---
If you can see the final landing point from the third platform you can get there directly with your Titan, go mid tree striker (the dolphin dive) and use your charged melee to fly straight on the roof
---
*Iron Banner*
---
It does look alot like it :V
---
Engrams drop at your gear level not including the bonus power. It also takes into account what's in your inventory iirc. So if you're carting around a bunch of low gear put that into your vault while you grind gear
---
Bungie made a mistake when turning everything to power 750 and accudentally made power 10 gear be power 0, my green starting rocket launcher is at 0 as well as my full damaged armor set.
---
It is the old old starting gear when one started at 0
---
You stole hush's thumbnail for Menagerie.exe
---
Yeah I mean it could just be buggy I guess but mine all defiantly turned into 951s
---
Lol ok

Suros is garbage and uses up an exotic slot. I hated it in D1 , I still hate it today. Recluse is steady and melts everything.
---
What I find funny is leaving counts as a loss so they are literally robbing themselves of the gear for no reason
---
Cool, thank you!
---
When I get a chance later I’ll pull up some more.
---
The game should absolutely be focused on endgame. Endgame is the game. 
---
Campaigns have never been hard, and the only purpose they have ever served is to progress the general story and provide context. Expansions are always endgame focused, and always should be
---
I usually just use short range weapon in crucible since I’m way too slow with the sniper aim. Might be ok with gambit invasion. Btw is it any good on pve or just straight pvp.
---
And yeah I do know iron banner exist but have no idea what that is
---
Wild that that dude scrolled through over 200 days of posts to find it. Prolly harder than making the meme on your own
---
you should've just killed him
---
I say this to myself literally every time I pop Storm Trance.
---
You can get them on amazon too, they make ones as well that hook into amazon Alexa based devices.  You can say commands like “invite —— to my fireteam” and it’ll invite them, kinda a cool option if you have the system
---
We've known what they are for quite a bit. Year 2 gave massive hints, especially in Jokers Wild with the final cutscene.
---
You shouldn't have been in his way....   
---
Seriously though the lag has been ridiculous!
---
(Rings bell)
---
I only have a Hunter that has access to that part of the game.
---
I've not done anything with my Titan or Warlock short of setting up their basic look, completing their intro, and doing a vault dump of items onto them to make room in the vault.  At some point though, when I do run through the game with my Titan, I'll remember your directions.
---
I've got 3x ( Triple ) Jump ability with the Hunter, and all the ability trees are open if that helps though.  Nothing continuous about the Hunter's jump abilities that I've seen though.
---
So she supposedly doesn't know its name and calls it "**weird floaty robot thing**", but remembers how it looks like even though it nearly never is on screen, and if it is, it is pretty small.
---
I was surprised to see the inferno emblem for doing PvP during the laser tag era with Prometheus Lens, crazy but good times
---
Got my Thorn yesterday. This was after 6 hours, 8 fireteams and some controller snapping moments of frustration.
---
Dont know how you could do it solo.
---
effin' love this community
---
Just asked my clan mates most say pinnacle drops are +1 over base level so if ur base 150 it would be 151 drop
---
Glad to see I wasn’t the only one
---
Or you could not torture yourself with IB, that's what I'm doing
---
Ah, wasn't aware of that. Thank you!
---
I just ran "will of the thousands" twice with the IKELOS_HC_V1.0.1 hand cannon
---
But my questline "The Machine's Gun" is not advancing. 
---
Whats wrong here?
---
edit: [this is what my quests look like](https://i.imgur.com/SDkiyRY.png). Still unsolved. [kappa](https://i.imgur.com/twJzsJh.png)
---
Lol I don’t know what to tell you. It’s a game. You earn rewards when you do what it tells you to do. Sorry you can’t “play your way” all the time and you actually have to stretch yourself a little to earn new shit
---
Hahahahahaahhaha
---
Thanks. I wasn't aware they mentioned that.
---
The unholy trinity
---
Yep. Whether you're doing cross save or just playing a new character on PC with your steam and PSN account linked to Bungie, you still need to purchase every DLC per platform you want to play on. They've stated this many, many times.
---
I'd argue that noob tubes are the noob tubes of destiny
---
No
---
It doesn't as far as I know. Could be wrong though.
---
I just figured out, I had a main weapon bug, just changing it solved the bug.
---
I get bitched at for using Snipeifurgay and this guy gets 300 fucking upvotes
---
For like the first year. Then it got really repetitive. Now after Blizzard’s little stunt, I’m glad I haven’t played in a while.
---
OEM or One Eyed Mask is an exotic Titan helmet that gives you wall hacks whenever someone damages you and if u kill the person who damged you, you get an overshield and all ur health back absolutly busted in pvp
---
oooh thats what it is, yea i can see why people are complaining lol
---
even this is a big no. the opening mission is al in the old tower as well as zero hour. and this room didnt exist in vanilla d2. it was added at the and of forsaken and with the beginning of black armory.
---
Oh the Titan cheese keeps getting more and more cheesy.....
---
hot dog bong water
---
Yeah
---
Actually *S T O P* I’m gonna sob
---
As i said before im almost Legend rank, and still didnt got my recluse because i heard you MUST win 100 matches of any comp. mode. I ranked Myth 3 in like 35 matches. My question was how did you completed the 100 victories (aside from reaching fabled) in that amount of time, or im mistaken and you have to win less matches to complete that part of the requierement?
---
It’s a helmet that if you get hit by an enemy it gives you a buff that lets you see them through walls and if you kill that enemy will you are tracking them you get and over shield and starts regen. It was way worse when it first came out.
---
Or spikes
---
Well played
---
Noted stay out of melee range of titans
---
He's the CEO of the Nine
---
5% of what? the victory part of the achivement? I been playing Rumble and i get 1% for ending first in kills. If i win iron banner matches i ill get 5%? 
---
Im 2% from Legend rank and still didnt got my recluse -_-
---
In previous seasons the iron banner bounties stayed in your inventory until you completed them. The downside is that if you wait too long and another iron banner starts and you complete the leftover bounties during the event it will count them as completed for that iron banner and you can't get the bounties again from that iron banner. So in short you can keep them, just make sure to turn them in before the next one.
---
Join the flat traveler society now
---
ok, thanks for clarifying lol
---
Maybe if I had a scout rifle that was basically the DRM from Halo: Reach. Bungo pls.
---
GG isn't the best. A sentinel or arc staff can deflect the rounds, it last sub 10 seconds, takes time to activate leaving you vulnerable, and you have no damage mitigation
---
I have now noted to shogun every titan I see because of this
---
I think I have some options:
---
• Bergusian Night from Bergusia/SotP
---
• Dreaming Spectrum from Last Wish
---
• Dusk Mine (green level shader)
---
• Shadow Gilt from the Menagerie
---
If you don't like these you can farm for some bright dust and buy one of these for 40 bright dust if they become available:
---
• Melchizedek Bramble
---
• Reefmade
---
• Amaranth Atrocity
---
• Arctic Pearl
---
• Nebula Rose
---
Are you seriously such a bad crucible player that pulse rifle kills is some impossible feat that is preventing you from getting your engrams?
---
And if not, what the hell is your deal?
---
Riskrunner was a really easy get. Just popped up one day from the Banshee vendor, I believe? Only gotta do some easy platforming and you'll get it + the catalyst within the same mission.
---
Get hit by arc damage = clear out a room. It's an amazing weapon against mobs.
---
Get you some hip fire play with Skyburner's.  It should make easy work of the close quarters maps.
---
JOTUNN
---
Bring me pure joy
---
Old dlc is included in new light, all you can buy now is forsaken and shadowkeep to get access to their respective activities
---
No, it’s locked behind pulse rifle kills, then fusion rifle kills, then msg kills, then grande launcher kills (which is bugged, you have to use an smg again). There are 5 total quest you have to complete in order to be able to freely get engrams for tokens.
---
Honestly just need to play around with stats the you find what you like. Everybody play style is defrent resistance is good for hunters if you feel like you are dying a lot.
---
It'd be too stronk paired with gamblers dodge unfortunately
---
It's real and real expensive lol. $20 fucking dollars to skip maybe an hours worth of grind. Just open chest on the moon. The Trove Guardian chest and rune locked chest are great for this. Also public events while you're running around. Was literally like 905 a few hours in not even really trying to power grind.   
---
(This may have been patched) There's also a way to just keep re-printing old white gear from your collections. Just make sure you keep clearing out your inventory to make sure the new gear has somewhere to go on your guardian so it'll count towards your POSSIBLE highest light level. Takes like 20+ mins.
---
That sucks...
---
lol yea, i kinda knew it i need forsaken hence i kinda unpleasant with this skin. so for now my skin is kinda useless, feelsweirdman i got a skin that i cant use lol
---
Your response doesn’t even make sense because the quest isn’t forcing you to at the game mode. It’s forcing you to use specific weapons for quest to unlock engrams. If it was just playing the game mode, the. All you’d have to do is get kills and hold controls points
---
It’s from the very first mission of the taken war. Not sure if you can still get the items. Mine have 0 light. The full armor set, the sidearm and a shotgun.
---
All good, just wondering why you would do that if you could still shoot body at same spot during crit downtime instead of flicking
---
this was the new Dom death for me, if you know you know :(
---
These dudes are a bunch of trolls dude just ignore them. I understand your point. The quest aren’t difficult but I do find them pointless as well. If you earn the tokens you should be able to use them.
---
 Almost upvote till you started flossing. Smh.
---
5-10 is a negligible difference, You really wont see a change till you have about a 25 point gap with a significant change at the 50+ range
---
You can play strikes or use the companion app to find people on the same platform as you to play with.
---
I competed it with huckleberry. I'm terrible at PvP, but liked the look of the armour. Quest parts carrying over really helps make it less of a grind.
---
This is somewhat plausible. However, I'm playing this game on the PC, so why not let me choose the input method from the options screen?  
---
I happen to be a sane person, so I don't use console controllers.
---
I don’t even use it though
---
Toaster
---
Eww
---
It’s bugged for that step. It shows grenade launcher kills, but if you get SMG kills it will fill the objective! That’s how I did it last night
---
FYI just wanna make this clear that this isn't my name. :) I saw this player and played againts him/her in Iron Banner. Name made me laugh
---
Use a submachine gun it’s a known bug and bungie is looking into it
---
Wizards hate him!
---
Oh that's interesting. What grenade would you prefer for the Solar class though?
---
Indeed
---
Why are titans so broken lmao
---
Yeah, SBMM my ass. I've won every single game I've played so far and it was never even close. Also the LLA doesn't seem to matter, as I've been killed easy by 900L players while I'm 940, and have killed 958 players easily as well.
---
Disagree.
---
I am keenly aware thank you
---
Don't you have to beat forsaken to see it?
---
I got 100 points on my only wins
---
its really salty thanks to recluse meta and some really stupid weapons.
---
also bottom tree striker. that doesnt help things.
---
What? Jade rabbit smacks.
---
I just left one, but to be fair I had bad eggs and my stomach feels like it’s getting bombed.
---
Ikora be lettin vex I. The tower like crota let vex in his Daddy's house SMH next we'll have to grab her by the legs and throw her in the portal after taking care of her mess. Y u do this
---
Meanwhile I'm still waiting for the day where tripmine grenades have the ability to 1 shot at least tier 0 resilience guardians.
---
All of my bounties dropped at 950, didn't even get a 951. all my gear is already 950.
---
CreamyKiwa you are an insolently jabbering eyesore!
---
Ahah that's weird, however I've been using an SMG the whole time
---
I am switching to my Titan from now on...
---
If it lives up to the original reputation of the thorn the pellets just carpet bomb your entire screen every time you fire
---
If you don’t like damage falloff you could also use jade rabbit, it doesn’t have it either.
---
big indeed
---
This is one of the Nightfalls this week
---
Magnum Please!
---
This dude this morning literally said ib is shit and mountaintop + recluse is everywhere
---
Man, I love that lore book, along with the Menagerie armor lore. It's basically in-universe fanfiction and they get so many things either wrong or *really* exaggerate them to the point it's hilarious
---
Hey at least you got an exotic. I ran that Nightfall 3 times in a row and all I got were blue items and 3 of those enhancement shards.
---
It's typically around a month I think. You might see it in the content road map, though.
---
I got the spine of Keres also and it's not working for me either.
---
Was hoping for some lore. Guess I'm just gonna pick up kill patrols until it's fixed...
---
Christ Borne, it's Jesus Jason.
---
Comp is a lot easier than the 6 stack multi mida tool teamshooting sweatfest that is QP
---
It’s always great when your melee shows up in killfeed first then you get shotgunned but they die after lol
---
Yeah but they have to be doing so.
---
So either they pop the super ahead of time and know you are coming, which hey every super pretty much counters roaming arc/void hunter if that happens.
---
Or they don't know you are coming with super already activated and you get the shot off.
---
There is practically no mitigation on roaming hunter supers. It will take one.
---
(Not that you won't have shots to spare anyway)
---
What you mean it’s nerfed? It still the best smg in the game.
---
Nope, they do not.
---
Can't say I've had problems with leavers, but I dont blame the people who do. I haven't had any fun in iron banner as it is just a collection of all of the cancerous builds in the game. 3v3 comp to legend was way more enjoyable
---
In remembrance of Cayde, we do the dumbest thing we could possibly think of because there is no way this goes wrong.
---
Cause they are now free from Activision’s grasp
---
Honestly mate its like 4 steps. I bashed it out in about 3 or 4 hours, maybe not even that.
---
Its about 100 kills worth with various weapons and a load of zone captures.
---
Ya you gotta give a little context.
---
Armor exotic is Sixth Coyote, which gives you a second dodge. You then slot 4 paragon mods in your gear and 2 distribution mods in your class item, causing your dodge to regen extremely quick. The middle tree solar allows ability regen any time burning is happening. You can even increase the speed at which you recharge using Prometheus Lens, the trace rifle, which causes a burning effect. You can use this method to generate super in 30ish seconds.
---
Playstyle is Grenade -&gt; Melee -&gt; Dodge -&gt; Dodge -&gt; Prometheus lens to top off abilities, blade barrage whenever you're ready
---
I just know you’re a OeM striker titan and you’ll never convince me otherwise lol, why else get so immediately defensive at the mention of titan cheese. I’ll say it again, this guy thinks he’s good at the game but all he does it crutch lmao^^
---
\*PTSD of farming Relic Iron intensifies\*
---
erentil or if you got a good roll wizen from the quest, but erentil mostly cause fuck it its the best sniper, shotgun, pulse rifle in the game
---
Bungie won't do this because they want to sell us ornaments.
---
This is the real question
---
I can see why you're so bad at the game, you can't take any form of criticism from anyone, even when you realize that you're clearly not in any way skilled at what it is you need help with.
---
The best player on your team can carry the match, believe it or not, as long as you don't soak up all the lives in your team and leave him with zero respawns.   So if you're that bad that you can't PvP against anyone, use your radar to stay alive.  And also, FPS's might not be the best genre for you... I'm assuming that any piece of content in the game that has matchmaking winds up with you being left in the dust to enjoy looking at the scenery while your teammates complete the majority of the mission, likely with their recluses.
---
Anyways, your options are either git gud, listen to people who clearly know better than you, or keep bitching while you keep failing.  And the more you tell people to go to hell, the less people will actually care enough to try to help you.
---
\^\^\^\^\^
---
Blackout is only fun because its paired with grenadier.
---
Wow a Titan not using OEM
---
That’s like saying “I’m vegan, I eat meat. We exist”
---
Damn! It’s like that? Geez...
---
I mean I’ve played since release I’ve never had a problem with hit reg but I do see the occasional person teleporting around because they don’t have good ping.
---
Most titan thing ever.
---
I like to use swarm but it’s all down to preference
---
lol name one gun in the energy slot better than recluse, don’t worry I’ll wait.
---
Thanks for answering the questions !
---
If Mike tyson says it with the TH, does it sound normal?
---
Did you play 3v3 survival? For recluse you need glory rank fabled so that's 2100 points of glory in the 3v3 survival playlist. Glory is different from Valor which is the rank you reseted earlier.
---
InDEED
---
That's why it's easy to get now. So literally anyone can get it.
---
Aa ok
---
Yea that’s really common for me now, before I could easily manage playing on even the American servers, now I can barely play pvp on the nearest
---
I just got my shit rocked by a full team of multi mida users teamshotting me on widows court. I don’t think there was a spawn where I wasn’t shot 2 seconds after spawning.
---
I breathed slightly harder when i saw this
---
"I fear no man, but that thing...
---
***Professional Vex Milk Drinker***
---
...it scares me."
---
It is for sure
---
Wins
---
Well most of my friends play apex and only two or three is in destiny. I mostly play with clan mates and then I have to take care of uni and work you know. So no raids since I don’t have a full team
---
If you were on at reset all the max power people were on because there's 4 easy Pinacle rewards. Once it's done and the armour set is collected there's no reason to play it.
---
 Ah shit....thanks for the heads up
---
And there it is. The Fuck You Got Mine.
---
You said you'd jumped at the same time which caused the collision. When I see a roaming super I get out of their way. Let them go clean up.
---
It wasn't the Fist of Havoc that killed you anyway, or the sudden acceleration. It was the sudden stop haha
---
1 more that isn't out yet.
---
your original thorn heals now
---
I hate it because I liked the original Save the World version of the game, no one wanted to play it and they tossed it to the side just to jump on the BR bandwagon :c
---
Maybe I just have gotten lucky with the matchups then.
---
K time to switch back to Titan
---
This is almost as bad as hiding from the Night King in the crypts of Winterfell.
---
I typically pair it with Revoker, but the Randy's quest has gotten me using scouts.  Completed my MIDA catalyst and I'm working on my Jade Rabbit catalyst now.
---
But sure, I'm part of the problem.  Me, for using the weapon that Bungie decided not to nerf.  Not Bungie for not nerfing it.  They're not the actual root of the problem at all.
---
There is no crossplay and whilst i do think it would be cool to have it between console versions but personally i wouldn't want it with the PC port due to m&amp;k, different settings and the potential for hackers ruining games.
---
#**INDEED**
---
There is plenty of solo missions and open world content. Strikes and the first two levels of the nightfall have matchmaking, as does gambit and crucible. Dungeons can be done solo if you are really good and patient, but I'd look for other players to help. Same goes for a few exotic quests. You can also find others to help with raids either here in Reddit on the sherpa subreddit or the destiny 2 app. Or, if you are patient, you can try a guided game for the raids which matches you up with other players.

---
Just checking, it is an awesome looking exotic for sure.
---
Actually you don't need all the wind part of the triumph in survival. Just the 2100 glory. I finished the wins-part of the quest a long time before I played "comp".
---
Im not exactly an SFM pro, but it looks like the lighting is coming from the space between the head, the bow, and the top of the arm, but either way it does still look nice

All Year 1 IB armor was pretty dope, you had kinda Japanese style armor and knight like stuff. Year 2 had some pretty nice stuff too, the season 5 stuff wasn't great but 4 and 6 were awesome, and this season's is really nice as well.

Even if you could you need a warm up.

Ok. Done.

You get it from a quest from Shaxx, friendo.
---
It's currently bugged. Bungie adressed this. Get your 10 kills with an smg and u will finish it.
---
That one in the F Tier is heavily debatable
---
Wouldn’t that help you go to heaven? If you respawn you just go back to life.
---
Thank you!
---
I reupped with a D2 App Screenshot👌, separate post.
---
Wait, how do you know what he looks like?
---
I thought they removed the light boost? I mean that’s just a remarkable waste of money now, like you said, it takes a few hours at most to get to 900.
---
Thank you my man
---
BTW how to archive fusion rifle kills ? Played three games and did not score one. Best fusion rifle for that ?
---
I guess I just missed out on everything I never really played D2 till now
---
Are you fat shaming? So much for the tolerant guardians. Also, look. Calus is mighty round. He is the ideal male shape. He explicitly has my dream body. He be positively THICC with power.
---
Go get et
---
To get new players to buy the game lol. Why else?
---
Destiny 1 was the same way nothing new
---
True
---
You don't get it from drops. You have to complete a quest by getting crucible wins and reaching fabled in the Glory rank (survival Freelance is your best option).
---
You cant
---
I used telesto, aim for the torso and shot, if you get luck all the bullets will hit and you will get the kill
---
Can’t
---
Oh no :(
---
Fucking mountaintop has won me so many games. It's super busted and as proof I offer every game I win with it.
---
On my way
---
Laughs in titan
---
Look at the triumph under Crucible, Glory Ranks, "The stuff of myth" recluse is the reward for completion.
---
Don't forget about the Iron banner GL kills.
---
A few ways, his model is reused a few times in destiny 2 for the festival of the lost nightmare and as a heroic boss for the public event witches ritual. Also i just googled alak hul
---
Where was this taken?
---
Where is this picture taken?
---
We can dream about changing it
---
Imagine playing destiny on console
---
🤘
---
PvP just isn't my style anymore... When I come home I just want to relax, and relaxing for me isn't PvP. Was definitely a hard slog this go around. It you weren't playing a META build or using a META weapon you were at a SERIOUS disadvantage. Ugh, the Recluse is the bane of my existence right now...
---
To be fair it was used in promotional material
---
I feel like I’m zoomed in on a sniper
---
Yes actually 😂 I saw one miss yesterday
---
Didn't even know it could go that high. Grats. Now to obtain the other 3 pieces with equally high stats lol
---
Ikr, i love how he just dissappears into nothingness then shows up right behind you with his axe
---
Is.. is this real..?
---
Delete the game
---
Sub machine gun lol
---
Where the Second Collapse we we need it?
---
I mean water is water bro, hit that shit up &gt;.&gt;
---
It’s the loading screen for fortnite. The servers are down, either intentionally or due to strain, because blizzcon is going on right now.
---
I love the steam names i encounter always a good time
---
Yeah, we met as I jumped past the blast and smoked the using it.
---
So everyone who just started the game with no DLCs with be the same as someone who bought all DLCs and has played since day 1. I know it's no comparison but imagine world of warcraft doing that
---
Account is gone 🦀🦀🦀
---
I can’t wait to understand all these memes haha
---
No need to imagine. We all did it in D1.
---
Your submission has been removed. We do not allow LOOT POSTS. 
---
Great work Guardian! However loot/roll/achievement posts are prohibited to prevent our subreddit from being cluttered (we get way too many!) - please keep these submissions in the weekly pinned loot/achievement thread. Thanks!
---
If you've got a question concerning if a roll you've got is good or not, try /r/ShardItKeepIt !
---
Is it one kill? I have never tried in PVP with those
---
Bublle titan + 10 points
---
Helm of saint-14 + 10 points
---
Actually using the bublle + 10 points
---
Using recluse - 500 points
---
This looks fake tbh
---
As a hunter main, I feel this when I play Titan.
---
Don't be that stupid please.... That's your own fault you waited an entire year to pick up forsaken right before the new everything was announced including MULTIPLE announcements that EVERYONE and EVERYTHING was being boosted to 750. This allowsF2P players insta access to all old non paid content. This was a move so we could get our friends into Destiny for free who didn't own it before and be able to play with them in all old content right away. How is it a kick in the teeth to anyone who's been playing the DLC for over a year? Also 750 was the pre-shadowkeep highest light level, not 400. If you were only at 400 and needed to grind all the way to 750 base to play any shadowkeep content that you paid for would't you be pissed off. Even if it was your fault for waiting to buy it for so long.
---
They nerfed the health of supers
---
The legendary Gunslinger who's Light orbs still remain til today from the BoTG, only kills one Hive in the entire DLC
---
It's because Hunters are familiar and play like people expect from an FPS.
---
Makes more sense now lol
---
Go talk to Ada-1 to start it
---
If you’re on xbox and have it set as your home Xbox then anything playable on your account can be played on his account.
---
Mountaintop Recluse is a stupid good combo. Can't go wrong with it but it sucks when everyone is using it. I run around with a blue sidearm as primary and my masterwork Outlast as secondary. It's great.
---
I love doing that kind of stuff on Nessus. The blocky structures are perfect for platforming, and you'd be surprised how far and high you can go before getting blocked by an invisible barrier. It's often a rather indirect route, though. You can't really go straight up. He probably started climbing halfway across the map. 
---
There are some pretty neat little spaces you can tuck into as well as some nice vantage points. c:
---
Hunters had Blink in D1. I'm sad it's gone now.
---
Weapons of Light on bubble is the largest team damage boost in the game, and combined with Helm of Saint-14 gives a powerful overshield to the party.  Melting point has always been good, and still is.  There's several useful builds in PvE for titans to support the team.
---
What is the absolute, maximum, *hard cap* for Power Level as of now in Shadowkeep?
---
(I'm not interested in the 950, 960 soft caps or guides on how to increase PL efficiently - plenty of articles and Youtube videos covering all that.)
---
It’s damage never got touched in pvp, just it’s range. So if you are close it’s like it used to be and melts still
---
You get it free with forsaken. Every forsaken owner has full access to Y2 annual pass content (don't get confused with the new season pass).
---
It was like that a week (more or less) before the move to steam.
---
No wonder I see so many Titans these days...
---
[deleted]
---
Warlocks are the most popular. Titans are only good in PvP cause their trash everywhere else. I haven't done a raid where there was a Titan.
---
Haha what the hell.
---
Happened to me today,got soo excited just to realize it was a shitty,ugly ghost shell
---
I wonder how this would have played out with middle tree sunbreaker and wormgod caress... (you know, for when you need to punch something a mile away right now)
---
And then bibbidy bopped back on into the infinite forest
---
You need to be in an activity to use them. Try starting a strike and seeing if you can use them then.
---
Forsaken and Shadowkeep are the 2 most recent expansions. I'd recommend both, but the most relevant content is Shadowkeep, so if you need to choose go with that one
---
Is this the new form of "repost" on Reddit? At least it gives credit to the original poster....
---
Ol’ reliable, at close quarters a fist is better than any gun.
---
Ikr, I tried putting a recovery mod on it and it capped out at 42.
---
I got on for the first time in a very long time and now I see what you mean. Trying to keep track of what weapon type to get kills with in which game type for all these weapon quests looks freaking annoying. Made much worse by the extremely cluttered menu screens
---
I buy all of the gun stuff from Ikora just to use these mind components and farm more shards. I don't even use the guns from VO.
---
They did it for New Light players when D2 basegame went F2P earlier this month. c:
---
Okay so is the annual pass the seasons of the forge/drifter/opulence or is it something else?
---
nice time u got tho
---
Fred Durst??
---
Because people love to shit on Zavala, and I honestly don't get it. In my eyes he made a good decision and even he knew in his heart what he wanted to do, but he has a city full of people to protect, he can't listen to his heart he has to look at things logically.
---
The raid, vex offensive, both of which are great coop for gear grinding, and slot of fun
---
I don't blame you, lore is pretty extensive.
---
OK, goes a little like this:
---
1. Mankind finds Traveler
---
2. Golden Age
---
3. Collapse
---
4. Dark Age
---
5. City Age
---
6. "Today" (roughly speaking)
---
The pyramid itself is a ship, like any other, the "Darkness" is a power, like the Light, and the wielders are what caused the collapse, the collapse being basically a big-ass war of sorts.
---
Now, what is "behind" the ship is an alien species called "Veil", that wield the darkness like we wield the light.
---
Now, this came from leaks, so 50-50, BUT
---
During the collapse the Traveler killed of the god of the Veil, basically an evil-darkness-using Traveler; and the evil species that worshipped it (the Veil) want to resurrect using the Traveler.
---
After the Red War and the Traveler's awakening, the evil "Veil" sort of awakened themselves and are en-route to us, trough the evil-pyramid-fleet we see on the ending.
---
&gt;Is the Pyramid essentially a piece of the Darkness?
---
So, to answer your question: *Not really.* The pyramid is a ship that is used by the species that wield the darkness

---
This is probably the most complete video on it, thus far.
---
How would I find out if that's the case? The frame drops are all over the place alot of the time.
---
I have done a clean wipe about 3 times in the last 4 months. Anything else I could do different?
---
Yeah I've got it on a Samsung 500GB. But its over 5 years old with no changes to SATA cables ws gunna get a new SSD 1TB the one that plugs directly into the MB. The Samsung 970 Evo Express SSD.
---
Flip a coin
---
Idk, I have hard times finding locks in non-raid stuff like strikes, nightfalls or just on planets. Maybe Im unlucky :D But I see titans and mostly hunters everywhere
---
I think there's a large amount of pvp complaints right now because there's a ton of new light people in the game who come into crucible with the wrong mindset. They are players coming from call or duty/Halo/battlefield.  None of these games play like crucible. Your aim is really the only transferable skill in d2 beyond that you have to learn effective kill ranges and learn to counter exotics.
---
Thank you anon, very cool
---
Exactly. If you leave them alone they become useless, and actually a detriment to their team leaving them shorthanded.
---
Is that Prince?
---
It is.
---
Gotz to go back and finish it...
---
Same way OEM + Bottom tree Striker is, overlooked and ignored
---
Top tier
---
Not Hush. MP Edits.
---
https://youtu.be/qGx2XoMCsMg?t=25
---
Menagerie armor lore is actually part of the Chronicon, guess they just had so many ideas that it couldn't fit in *just* a lore book or *just* armor tabs it had to be both
---
Though Idk if there are different versions of forsaken purchases
---
I see more Warlocks and Hunters. I almost never see a Titan outside of PvP. And I certainly never see a Titan without OeM.
---
The OEM is to keep him alive as an insurance, what allows him to kill people like that is thunder coil from the artifact. I could get the same result with wormgod caress or skullfort.
---
Go drifter
---
Correct
---
P U N C H
---
Yes, this is no easy problem. You want the world to be realistic, but with enough mobs to (re)spawn. Hard to balance. What I would do in this case is keep things logical. Legionairs and other humanoid troops are the easiest. They can drop in from small ships, or spawn where nobody is seeing them a few screens away and roll in on some ground vehicles or foot patrols. 
---
I would turn the ghoul like demons into physical aliens. Their eggs are almost everywhere, they hatch when needed, grow up fast, can eat each other to grow up even faster and thus "realistic" respawning is done. 
---
The goblin bots could be replaced by a "evil program" that can infect any machines, drones, bots, vehicles, mecha suits, and attack players with a element of surprise. They don't necessarily break completely but only "die" by turning off after being damaged enough. 
---
I haven't seen many other enemy types so far. But a logical dynamic approach like this would make the world seem much more realistic than just endless armies of magically materialising enemies that appear with surprise buttsex all around you "because we need hectic fights durr". I rather have a few quality mobs with tension than a million trash mobs who "just appear anytime anywhere for whatever reason who cares".
---
Iron banner has just reignited my absolute fucking hate for titans and their God damn one hit melees
---
looks so nice to be able to play this game on a good connection on not on these shitty ass literal african hosts i keep getting even though i live in fucking australia
---
DING!
---
While I agree, I don't know that I'd go around calling myself jesus...
---
Screw Drifter
---
From a narrative standpoint, it would be really cool if the darkness wiped out humanity with only a few select Guardians remaining, including our own. It's not really a sustainable plot, but it would be badass and moderately terrifying for the Guardian to go on a rampage and absolutely decimate the darkness after that.
---
Oh so you're approaching me? Instead of running away, you're coming right to me?
---
I really enjoy the more simplistic style this set seems to be going for. Helmets that cover entire faces without a visor, like the titan and warlock one are some of my favorites.
---
I'd go with drifter, but rewards are the same.
---
I sense your insecurity kicking in.
---
omg thanks. thats really amazing, i stopped playing destiny 2 due to the fact i couldnt get the anual pass and had run out of things to do. i am literally installing it tomorrow. :)
---
Yes, cross counter will one hit.
---
812 KILLS?!?  LORD SHAXX HAVE MERCY.
---
oh wow. how easy is getting it?
---
Whenever I play comp, if an oem kills a teammate, it's such a damn hassle.
---
Team drifter
---
i know that but some times dlc for multiplayer games are only for 1 account (like The crew: wild run).
---
Thanks for the answer
---
It’s meant as a joke. I’m sure there’s a bible verse someone will comment about people believing the prophet is false or some shit.
---
Hey I just got mine delivered today!
---
Just pick which one you want, pick the other on one of your other characters so you can do both if you want. It's just for lore/completion as far as I know. I never bothered to finish the allegiance quest when I found out how meager the rewards were, and you don't even get those rewards anymore.
---
It’s so good in pve though. I have the anti barrier mod on it and it melts
---
The bubble that isn't really a bubble? The one where you're anchored to one spot, but another super blows right through it? The one sort of like a warlock class ability but worse? Weird that I don't see people using it often...
---
Drifter will make you rich brother, *I promise*
---
What’s your power level?
---
This would be much easier if cayde was still here
---
Doesn't matter either way. The Drifter is a shade of Grey. He's not completely wrong, but I wouldn't call him right, either. The Vanguard, or Aunor is much the same from what I remember. The only difference I've noticed is that Drifter will call you a snitch if you side with the Vanguard during Gambit matches. That's all, really. I don't know if future content will take this decision into account, but as it is right now the choice is irrelevant.
---
Oh man, I forgot about SKyburner's. It was my very first exotic! Is it any good now?
---
Trauma and hard times throughout the course of your life will make you a better person. Especially if you succeed! Never know until it was to happen ;)
---
I personally have never encountered that. But I really only play destiny so that could be why
---
And.... Guess im not playing this iron banner.
---
I mostly picked this game up for PvP while sprinkling in cool PvE. I can't have end game without PvP. This games PvP feels like cancer tbh
---
Riskrunner is one of the easiest exotic quests.
---
Cayde was overated. Sorry not sorry.
---
pulses are still real good, got a nice rolled claw of the wolf and it fucking destroys
---
Fairly new to D2 and I grabbed heavy ammo one round and he just chuckled.......I was dying. Not even mad I got killed before I had a chance to use it
---
Is there any exotic armor to get via quest which is not from the shadowkeep campaign
---
Since older campaign does not reward me exotics anymore(cleared red war, nothing given)
---
If not I will back to 950 nf loop... 
---
and hope to get armor...
---
Mid tier melee ability would be nice to have a one-shot as well.
---
Riskrunner gang
---
Correction: stay out of mid range from titans
---
I was actually friended and invited to play comp with Scrota I’ll have you know
---
I am more amazed at how none of these people were using a shotgun...
---
Titans are balanced :)
---
........truth is you don't..........
---
I have no interest in getting better at Destiny 2 PvP. It is quite frankly badly balanced and subjectively not my style of PvP. My argument is simple and valid, it has nothing to do with not being willing to put in the work. I am perfectly willing to earn those Weapons in PvE.
---
If I want to play PvP I am not playing a bouncy castle simulator.
---
wait what? how do you get that to pop up?
---
Warlock tramp stamp?
---
Bringing pound town to Twilight Gap, lol.
---
Same
---
Oh so the chances are very small?
---
Thought this was D1
---
Does anyone know how to get the "Huckleberry" exotic apart from the random Fated engram drop?
---
Ah. There's your problem.
---
Except every other player switched to this name after the post a few weeks ago.
---
Nice
---
Don't give away my secrets!
---
Thanks, but I am neither on Xbox nor willing to get carried.
---
Brain dead bois
---
Fuck the fantasy, titans are too good and it makes the game unfun. Saying this as a titan main. I wish my class of choice were more balanced.
---
Yeah I don’t think it’s F tier armor, pretty much all iron banner armor is like at least high D tier armor, I just wanted to make sure all spaces were filled
---
Nice play Shakespeare!
---
That doesn't make sense, execution is the one you need smg kills for.
---
Luckily with the save transfer thing, I only have to play ps4 when my homies want to play. 😎
---
What.... What happened?
---
Not any more. Its a rotation from what I know. 
---
Check this link out. What I thought was a weekly rotation is only a daily rotation. 
---
https://gamertagzero.com/destiny-2-shadowkeep-where-are-the-forges/
---
Memes in this subreddit are so cluttered.
---
Most Welcome
---
From my experience so far
---
That’s a joke... right?
---
Fist me harder
---
Black armoury quests and forges are very glitchy right now.  I would wait to do these until Bungie sorts it all out
---
Thotgun
---
This is very true.  I lost a match 3v2 (we had three, they had 2) because one guy with 0.2 k/d kept running in getting killed and whittled us down until we lost round after round.  It was painful.
---
Most people that play Destiny 2 dont know what spawn point control is. 
---
Only people that do know it are people that played CoD or BF before Destiny so they got experience behind them.
---
Ok really wanted the izanagi
---
Sorry, it was a colloquialism for mechanical hard drive heh
---
Your 2070 Super is practically a 2080 so you shouldn’t be seeing minimums on par with my lowly 2070. Especially since your 8700k has slightly faster single thread performance my 2700X
---
Is your RAM indeed running an OC? 3100MHz is certainly atypical and indicative of an overclock, that’s why I ask.
---
Thanks Spielberg!
---
Voop Nation disapproves
---
More like they don't have the time or the patience for people with negative attitudes who don't want to learn. Or people who don't want to communicate. Carried a couple of raid virgins through GoS the other day and trying to get them to speak was like pulling teeth.
---
Mfw pocket nova bomb
---
“I can’t wait to see what you do with that...”
---
You didn’t meet people on there to play with? Guild? Raid buddy’s? Pvp friends?
---
True guardians care about the safety of our citizens
---
Ikora doesn't have stompees MT or relcuse I give my chances at a solid slighty above fucked.
---
Never said it is terrible. Simply stated, that imo the scaling is VERY fucked.
---
But generally speaking, if you no lifed until now, you have a breeze in here, bc 900ish players are basically doing nothing to you. I was doing fine with 950 myself, but clanmates of a friend of mine with which I played srsly couldn't do shit, they just got 2tapped by pretty much anything.
---
Thank you guy's for recommendations! I really appreciate it!
---
Titans all day, every day.
---
They are working on it, it’s a good gun.  I would follow their patch notes to keep track of when the fix drops
---
Did you just PUNCH a stormtrancing Warlock?!?!
---
I mean that wouldn’t work because the portal is opening in a few weeks and we have a season pass of content to get through still
---
New light players probably don’t have it.
---
I thought that they were never given the light and that's why they're so jealous that we have it.
---
darkness is triangle
---
I have really shitty luck and pretty mediocre at D2 PvP..... In games I do good I've had leavers, throwers (people who'd just run to the other team and emote in front of them burning all our lives), and just over all bad teammates. In games I do badly, my team isn't much better than me or is a good solo player but doesn't stick together and gets plenty of high risk kills but dies a lot too. I'm about half way there after 30 games.... 
---
I was really good at D1 though....... lol
---
You had me at "Infection". Since they are able to do stuff like the Scorched playlist last week, I feel like they could introduce this mode fairly easily.
---
Personally. The biggest tip I can give to anyone finding PvP hard is adjust your controller or mouse sensitivity. Some people have it either way too low or way too High.
---
PEREGRINE GREAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAVES
---
Totally didn´t get attention with Gambit and all the Nerfs that happened because of PvP. have fun deluding yourself.
---
I’m genuinely sorry that this was put in when New Light dropped. PvP is actually very fun when broken things such as this, Recluse/Mountaintop, and more aren’t common in matches
---
yes I read that as well, still don't understand how to accumulate points though.  The other two are going up but score isn't...what do I have to do to get that to go up.
---
Must be nice to not have skill but the game feels bad for u
---
lmao to the titans thinking there’s no issue with them
---
Here I am still just using Nameless Midnight, the best of all scout rifles.
---
Trixie Titanses...
---
I mean there's still a active primeval spawned in the tower so
---
He was an exile.
---
Try Nameless Midnight
---
I get that it looks horribly broken, but seriously, we're in a shotgun meta this shouldn't be as big of an issue as it is
---
well fusions and SMG are needed in quests in the IB. and only SMG thats a real "problem" is recluse
---
Nah they got it but the traveler abandoned them. The traveler was about to abandon earth too but Rasputin shot his ass down and he was forced to give us light powers (thus creating guardians) in order to defend itself
---
Oh that actually makes sense! 😂
---
Yeah I just don't get it!
---
I have no idea what my RAM is running at. Stuff being checked in the Bio is pretty much 0.
---
Thanks for the confirmation. You **are** able to forge any weapon frames on any forge playlist.
---
Here's a snippet from that article you have linked:
---
&gt;As per the rewards you will get in shadowkeep’s forge rotations, you can complete any Weapon Frame in the forge rotations. **They do not require any specific forge to go to, in order to complete them.** A big sigh of relief for those who were wanting the forges to be less grindy and more rewarding.
---
Saw one the other day that was “Hashladun Slinging Slasher”
---
Yeah titans are still too good
---
YOURE GOD! THANK YOU!
---
Not sure on the why. My friends and I just call them "charge."
---
And sorry for the explanation, the way I read your question I took it that you didn't know about them.
---
Wtf is that range? I tried to warlock slap a guy literally 2 inches in front of me and i miss. Those few times the slaps register they barely tickle a titan. The hell is this?
---
Thunder coil mod on the artifact, I think kruzer did 2 videos on it
---
V.Wing is good once you get use to the 5 burst mode
---
Says you. Just watch me. \*Titan Punch\*
---
Just do the quest he gives you.
---
Your good, it’s my bad.
---
Hes a lot stronger at 960. I was at around 925 last night playing against 950+ and i had to struggle with each kill even if i engaged it. 
---
I cant say in % since i dont have a 960 reference but im pretty sure i did 20-30% extra damage to players at same power as me compared to 950s. So im guessing 950s do around 10-20% over that. 
---
Its a massive difference and it sure as hell aint easy competing with them if you're too low. Its not impossible, i could usually pull 2+ KDA against them, but its much harder so it forces you to play much slower and smarter since each engage will take you forever to finish.
---
Inb4 it takes Bungie 6 months to acknowledge it and then not nerf it.
---
Faaaaark. What's your loadout look like? I'm pretty sure I was on the opposing team, I got bitchslapped a few times in a row by a fellow titan last night. I'm not even mad.
---
If the lore is there(I dont know it) then cool. 
---
 But it was a legit question. So your sexist assumptions are just internet pavlov's dog crap. There is a complete flood of lazy and politically charged writing all over movies and games right now. A character should be strong because they did what it takes to be strong. Not just be some favored identity group of a bad writer.
---
A lot of "Strong" characters nowadays are only strong because of some deus ex machina that the writers give them. This should be far more insulting than how many of said group gets to be the hero. Spoiler, there have been strong leading ladies in stories for a long time.
---
*warlock
---
well IB is ment to be the end game PvP thing so yeah high light people have advantage there they kinda warn you in the description of it
---
Trust me.
---
It's not that hard to catch up
---
I'd also buy Shadowkeep and the other one (whatever it's called), but y'know I'm a poor student
---
Honestly, I wish I could experience the naivety that I had with D1 exotic drops. I played up till the taken king entirely solo, not realizing I could just LFG a team together it made it so I knew next to nothing about how to get what, and from where. With nobody to guide me It made me a really really good PVE player though, I still completed the nightfall every week after Christmas.
---
I didn’t even know how to find or that xur existed. I thought he was a limited time event that showed up every few months so I didn’t actively look for him.
---
The removal of heavy from Gambit Prime would make it so much better.
---
what the heck is that mag size, that isn't evenly divisible by anything, it's literally a prime number, what are the bursts like, aaaaa
---
Ah bummer, thanks for letting me know though
---
They cap at 950 but then again there is a chance for it to be an exotic.
---
Rarity doesent matter too much power wise. It matters for perks on a gun and things like that. An 850 exotic will provide the same power as an 850 rare. But the perk will be really good to warrent having it on
---
You have to run a bunch of public events, lost sectors, patrols on whatever planet has the Flashpoint for the week. This week is Io, last week was tangled shore, next week will be a different planet. Different activity’s give you different percentages towards completion to get the gear
---
yes people still do this, but you have to pay most of em now
---
Synthoseps?

It's the fact of forcing me to use these weapons. I play pvp constantly and I have weapons I'm comfortable with, it's not fun having to play entire matches with new weapons because I'm forced to in a mode that is pretty competitive compared to regular pvp. It's not easy to make 20 kills with a fusion rifle if you are not used to the timing or 10 kills with a grenade launcher if you are not used to going for the heavy ammo whenever it spawns.
---
Same here.
---
Any fusion rifle 😂
---
Same energy https://youtu.be/hHZvUeAdzeI
---
Please teach me the ways
---
Do you play on console?
---
It triggers after you do x amount of damage with the gun. Is your arc logic a bit under leveled?
---
She also killed a some civilians in a hostage situation with the Shadows of Yor, all she wanted was the Shadows dead and she didnt care who was killed. Not to mention she thinks that we were the ones that got Cayde-6 killed, that's why I went with the Drifter.
---
Negative, they just cant 1v1 with skill. Only instakill melee garbage.
---
The fact that you ape the shit out of them without pulling up your shotgun once..... that was disgusting
---
Yes I’m on PlayStation
---
I cant seen to find a Stormcaller build that powerful to play. 
---
If you use Monto Carlo with Attunment of Grace you can be empowered with Guiding Flame constantly. That is about as good a build as I have come up with for Dawnblade.
---
it's a combination of a seasonal mod that increases arc melee damage and exotic arms that increase melee damage and range
---
Yes. The class that takes no talent lol
---
Everyone who has a special weapon equipped will drop special ammo when they die.    
---
If you have ammo scavenger perks,you'll pick up extra rounds.
---
That's honestly what I think will happen. Theres all the ghosts on the moon mimicking guardians like its learning how they work. Then there was the shadowkeep ending. It would make crucible alot more fun than just red vs blue. It should be said that I dont know much about the lore, I like it that way, I can imagine up what I dont understand. No matter what I've been excited to see what happens when the pyramids arrive since the end of the main campaign.
---
Ahhh the Joy's of hearing a nova bomb finish charging while you're being chased by a striker or WotW hunter only to blink straight up turn around and YEET that shit down their throat like a vitamin supplement. 
---
Shaxx is the only reason I got through comp.
---
I mean, that was a sick play. Very nice
---
Ah, I remember playing this cards. All the 6 of them.
---
Im gonna try 2 get the gun? What meta weapons do u recommend
---
Right, but why aren't there replacements? The crucible armor is cool, but that awful emblem in the middle with the bright blue clashes with everything.
---
Yep, he mad.
---
I know this, but it also depends on how good a player you are and even if you have the guns that are needed. I think I will be able to do it during the weekend. 
---
But like I said, what if you don't have time? What if you are at work or school pretty much all the time, the only time you have free is the short hours when you sleep. So what would happen then? Like what would have happened then to that engram? Just disappear?
---
Hunters have a really high skill ceiling because of how their movement is. Really quick ways to get out of line of sights, dodge, really strong control of vertical space. Movement is what helps you outplay others, and hunters are king of movement. 
---
Note: Movement not speed.
---
To top that off, we have some of the best neutral game subclasses out there: Middle tree and bottom tree arcstrider, top and middle tree void. The rest are average but still really strong, except for bottom tree golden gun which needs buffs.
---
As a hunter main thats been to legend a couple of times, there is a reason why the cheesy tactics don't work against better players, why movement and quickness are viewed in high regard, why hunters survive and even THRIVE in a meta that has OEM. 
---
Even in the roaming super meta hunters were still really strong in high ranks despite nerfs to our strongest roaming super, and despite the dominance of bottom tree dawnblade and bottom tree striker.
---
Don't get me wrong though, I hate OEM, I hate how the health regen is on bottom tree striker, and I think these should be nerfed. But if people continue to undersell how strong a hunter can be, and continue to pretend like we have "nothing" then they'll never understand how to play the class' strengths.
---
It’s at 938
---
Dont be upset everyone hates your class 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Can somebody tell me why Explosive Payload is listed as one of the "God-Roll" perks for Bite of the Fox (or similarly, any other Snipers)? I don't understand why.
---
Ahh well I must have bad RNG then ha
---
if they have gwisin they get energy back on kills i think
---
I don't know what I expected here but I am not disappointed
---
Lmao didn't even see that 'til now
---
punch
---
Calm it down. No need to get so hostile so fast. Also, he never argued the existence of guardians before us. He said that the fallen were under the light of the traveler before us which is completely true. 
---
After some research (Very little) it was easy to find this:  
---
" The Fallen civilization in particular once hosted the Traveler, which they named the Great Machine. However, it left their system around the time of the Whirlwind."  
---
So this clearly shows that the traveler did actually cover the Fallen, more specifically the Eliksni and a couple others too before us. So yeah, he were right. 
---
But as I stated before, please do not insult someone on this sub. Leave it at that.
---
NO GOD PLEA-
---
Seriously, he's still dwelling in the past. Get with the times old man.
---
I feel the opposite, half the fun of Destiny is communicating with the people (when they're not toxic) and watching content creators make guides and builds. Sometimes it's about suff I already have or knew how to do, and sometimes it's completely new. But each interaction is either a teaching or learning experience. Truly the most magical thing about the game imo.
---
yes he is
---
As you are leveling, don't worry too much about what makes a gun good. Try them all, see what works best for you and try finding a gun of that archetype that works. Me, for example, I'm not a fan of hand cannons, however I can use most 140/180 RPM hand cannons. I also can't stand using most SMGs and during the entirety of year one only ever used auto rifles because they were what I could handle being new to FPS games, especially one with space magic.
---
Each gun type has different archetypes and, depending on their stats, hit for varying amounts of damage, handle VERY differently as we as having different recoil patterns. Recoil only really matters on console, though as most PC users aren't really all that affected.
---
...but you *will*  waste your patience typing up a rage-o-graph on this sub to people who were better off without your nitpicking.
---
Dummy thats a sparrow
---
Light level effects the damage when it’s low on your character. Unfortunately each tiMe you get a higher piece you replace it right away. If you get a good legendary then keep it and infuse it later. If you wonder what the good roll is for said weapon I always google “god roll for XYZ weapon” you will find a video.
---
Lol it's not a fake english accent, its a real New Zealand accent which is where he's (Karl Urban) from. :)
---
I feel ya, especially when he yells at you for losing when you loaded into a game in progress on the losing team...
---
Honestly not sure as to why I only started playing in forsaken I just learned that somethings are some ways because bungie said so :P
---
indeed
---
I really only played pvp since D1 and tbh it doesn’t feel that op I outgun it all day with my pulse
---
I've been slappin' folks with a mediocre Trackless Waste roll, masterwork Outlast, and a 'nade launcher. Nothing fancy.
---
I'm glad I didn't dissapoint you lol
---
I also love doing that launch thing. as it's random, you can literally launch in any direction and can lead up to anything.. and your guardian's death... One time on Titan I actually launched myself so far that I hit the invisible wall outside of the map and fell in the water below
---
"What's he gonna do? Headbutt the almighty" Asher describing what every Titan was thinking before deciding it would be too fair of a fight
---
There are a lot of good legendaries that drop from seasonal content of Forsaken
---
A sense of humor
---
yea I just didn’t want to hear it so I’d mute dialogue and ingame sounds too sometimes and put on cartoons on my phone
---
Well Done! very slick moves
---
but it is just op with master of arms
---
Ha! But you have given them away yourself by confirming such!
---
Thank m you FBI, if there's one thing we can agree on its that meme stealing leads to death
---
Well must be an top guy if hes doing it for free
---
Stats and looks
---
EDIT: The armor that can get the highest stats is "pinnacle" armor, though.
---
So many shards
---
Does anyone wear a hard hat? I mean not that I wear mine, but still.
---
?
---
I honestly don’t get calling it an ultimate
---
Like genuinely why? It’s called a Super in game, Bungo™️ calls it a super. 
---
I don’t get it I guess
---
I’m just jealous that Titans have some brutal melees
---
Kill me.
---
Thank you. I'd blanked on what the super was called somehow. 
---
Im.. I play no hunter. I'm a warlock main if you cant tell.
---
hamper bros!
---
Run the riskrunner quest from Banshee's. Definitely much easier to obtained than the weapons u have mentioned above
---
Hunter don’t got blink
---
o nice
---
Aww thanks for testing tho!
---
Have tried goin to bungie.net , go to community then my clan and click on and try changing the leader of the clan that way?
---
Also there are shader as well but idk is there another way to get them outside the season pass. In collection(the place where you can get all the things like weapons/sparrow/ship/shader/emblem alike) it says something about its reward from season pass.
---
Mine still says preparing for shipment, no info or anything! Sent an email to bungie’s help, no answer either :(
---
this warlock wishes more titans would come raid with me instead of spending all their time in pvp but at least they’re having fun
---
Lord Shaxx at the Thighlight Gap. Is that a Razelighter in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?
---
Probably because you are not up to 900 power level yet
---
chip damage can always finish another guardian. the damage output of the explosion is always welcomed
---
Yeah fortnite does it, magic arena does it, and dead by daylight is coming out with a battle pass system and they plan on doing it. Its a common way for these to work. So yeah........
---
"titans aren't op"
---
Yes. I would suggest doing freelance survival. Otherwise you’ll just run into pro crucible teams.
---
Yeah it definitely does. Not sure what this person is talking about.
---
This shouldn’t be allowed or even possible. How is he doing it? That’s just broken
---
She is smol compared to your titan brute but she is tough
---
I would’ve said “this guy is cheating, I’m about to leave this match” hahaha
---
get Powerful Engrams and farm strikes/crucible until you get to 920 power level, then try to do the Nightfall at Hero(920 Power)
---
Great, if this shit keeps up my 10 year old son won't be able to play with me anymore.
---
It uses your steam profile name if you’re on PC
---
I vote for all 9...
---
I swap constantly.
---
If they do blow up our gear again for a sequel, I’m done with Bungie.
---
thanks
---
i just snapped my fingers
---
I appreciate the response! Thank you for the help.
---
They just took the name from a clan that was somewhat large back in D1. I used to run with a few of their members way back when. Not really sure if the clan is still active though :/
---
I watched a teammate pop hammers epic af and across the way a striker uses Thundercrash and it was like a superhero fight. The angle I had was cinematic af haha
---
I have that exotic, what's the seasonal mod? and do I have to be a titan to pull it off?
---
Mostly because we didnt went to war with uldren..
---
He sounds like a bug
---
You don’t. We don’t have the technology yet.
---
That’s one of the coolest ghost shells there are.
---
Yours is.
---
Destiny 2: Fight the Communists
---
i hate to badmouth the only class i play but rift is fucking trash outside of pve 
---
if you’re taking the time to lay down a rift in pvp you’re just asking to be killed 
---
id have more of a chance at surviving if i ran high recovery and tried to emote as a distraction tbh
---
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
---
Did you not play sports growing up? I mean anything competitive has a mental side to it. I don't care if you're competing in a hot dog eating contest or competing in the Olympics. Anything to get an edge over your opponent as long as it's within the rules. Too many softies out there today.
---
U can tryout the nightfall strikes for a higher difficulty! If not just try out the different game modes that are available like gambit, gambit prime, the reckoning, the menagerie etc. 
---
The thing with regular strikes and missions are that they can be easily done. The best difficulties are indeed in the raids and the dungeons
---
Oops, sorry forgot to include that, riskrunner was the first exotic I managed to get.
---
He told you some of the big differences differences.
---
Er try visiting spider to kick off the forges quests
---
Yeah, that honestly just holds up a sign to a large enemy force that says "Hey, you can kill one of our most important officials, and we won't declare war on you!"
---
Killing them would require using your finisher to cinematically crush their ghost.
---
Top one is the video this is commented on (one of the artifact mods + bottom tree striker)
---
Bottom one is insurmountable skullfort with top tree striker.
---
Sorry should’ve clarified, to make it  cool down faster you need to use paragon mods.
---
Completed bounties stay forever. The power level will cap at the end of the season/years max power, but waiting should be fine. For example, I turned in ones from last season at the beginning of this season and got some 750 weapons, when I was already 900.
---
Yes from shaxx
---
50/50
---
My favorite is his warlock with a gun line when you get a 5 kill streak
---
You got a Permit for that Vex gate
---
Noob question but I'm a warlock and always need 2 punches to kill. What am I doing wrong?
---
Honestly, it's not popped up on my feeds, I'm not sure how. I even waited to ask!
---
Hey not all titans are shotgun apes
---
Well, I can´t help you with your problems. Maybe see a professional.
---
Have a good life mate.
---
*Warlock Confused Noises*
---
Dam right !! Dot to be a badass to be a badass lmao
---
My bad, thanks!
---
And? It's not gonna save them from getting one-punched by raging Titans.
---
Really got addicted to the game again in Shadowkeep, enjoying it so much!
---
Swords are pretty lit when the enemy team is dumb enough to be grouped up close and with little room to manoeuvre. You can go through them like a blender.  Only issue is getting close.
---
Needs more context. How do you mean how do you do the bounties? As in his graphic there? Or are you specifically asking how do you do bounties? Asking a legitimate question so we can clear up the confusion here.
---
They still have yet to fix the chalice from last season
---
Doesn't matter if I take a break if the game puts me against 3 stacks all the time. I mean, it's not even close
---
did you directly launch Savathun's song/Will of the Thousands strikes from Titan/Mars?
---
Spawn into game, immediately lose.
---
Man I'll never love any one hit kill in video games.
---
Can't do that with bottom tree striker..... Titan haters heads will explode
---
The first story mission on Io, called Sacrilege, you can choose it from 3 guns as a reward from Asher Mir.  Otherwise it’s just a random drop.
---
Is that crimson I see
---
Its okay. Others get glory, but they stand upon our shoulders. Our rifts are indispensable
---
How did you finish it I can’t get the key mold to drop
---

Drifter
---
"This isn't over until Shaxx sings, and he's shy"
---
Ahh ok, thanks for the clarification. Back to grinding out strikes.
---
This game is literally played by 13 year olds lol
---
No I only have played control so far. I'm more want to do  pve stuff on destiny 2 anyway because I already play Overwatch which is enough competitive stress in my life. But yeah I feel the matchmaking feels pretty fair. I did play some Destiny 1 and am I religious Halo fan so it's not like I'm unused to arena shooters.
---
Looks like the rifleman took snipers Sydney sleeper.
---
Most powerful guardian
---
Thiccachu
---
You need better fiends.
---
Why use wormgods caress when you can one bang already feelsbadman.
---
How do you even get this low now that everything is 750 light?
---
What build is that? 
---
(Not like imma use it or anything hehe....)
---
I really want it to go division on us and let there be dark guardians that we can play as :D
---
Red Legion is simply a legion of cabal. Just like the Skyburners or Siege Dancers
---
I recently came back to the game after about a year break and IMO it’s never been better, it seems like they finally really got everything to just “click” and I feel like they will release content regularly enough to keep just about everyone happy.  There’s always exceptions though
---
hi! thanks for answering. ive completed the bountis like a one week ago.
---
This is why I hate titans ...because it's like playing destiny2  but on easy mode.
---
Do vex invasion, iron banner, or survival for legendaries
---
You, i don't like your flair
---
Already did 
---
Kinda feel bad that we turned our back in everyone who’s been kind to us.
---
Oh if you mean the Edit I fixed the auto correct error
---
What did you use?
---
Ohhhhh ok that’s odd I don’t know then, good luck though!
---
Party up
---
Any of the 180s. Trust is decent, service revolver is quite nice and optative is damn good as well.
---
Trust comes from gambit
---
Service revolver from vanguard tokens
---
Optative from vex offensive
---
those are rookie numbers
---
May we weld the ace of Spades in remembrance of him
---
Honestly, he makes my day way better. After a long day of work, i love killing some guardians in crucible and hearing Shaxx encourage me all that time makes it all better.
---
Count me in.
---
snapshot w/ full stability rounds/barrel. I wouldn't mind getting a stability/unflinching/stability perk one though
---
Took you that long to kill him though lol...if he had striker on he would have hit you easily with a shoulder charge. Just saying
---
When the grenade throws you
---
You are not doing it wrong.
---
There is a chance to obtain a rare bounty everytime you complete and turn in a bounty Ada. 
---
You don’t need to turn in all at once for a higher chance. It’s a rare bounty, that’s why.
---
I farmed 4 weeks of bounties for my first rare bounty
---
I have the same problem. I buy the extra bounties from Vanguard and Shax to get Bright dust. It’s any easy way to knock off $3k for each one
---
I just came back to the game a week ago... I'm sitting around 910... Constantly getting 1 shotted by 960 players (or higher) in IB... This isn't an event. It's more like a lesson in extreme patience for me...
---
Then I find out, that my IB tokens, hard earned from a slew of losing matches, can't even be turned in until I finish Scour the rust... Fucken amazing.
---
You should rename yourself Muhammad Ali
---
Ye, me too, got 4 yesterday and 2 today. Now sure why 2 reset like that.
---
Yes you can still get those
---
honestly if I could go back too the launch of rise of iron I would by far my favorite destiny dlc out of both destiny games
---
Brb hiding lightbulbs from the spoopy boys.
---
I've seen scrota and I'm friends with options
---
Did he tell you to stop killing him, in a pvp mode?
---
r/destinyusernames
---
I feel better for choosing the drifter already.
---
Yes. But they ate quite the quest.
---
Hi yes I will take all the falln please and thank.
---
You’re right! I misread the info graphic
---
To Legend rank in comp we go!
---
thx :(
---
Such a cool skill tree, makes you feel like an electric space wizzard!
---
Maybe but if they do they will be pale as hell as they will have to never see the light of day
---
Those three are tied into quests. I’m not sure if they are part of the free to play version of destiny. In fact I am almost certain you have to buy forsaken in order to get those specific exotics.
---
Damn!
---
Had a very similar strat in d1. Called it straight line man. He runs in straight lines
---
Hell yea! I tryed it and its so much fun! But I usualy fail in timing of actifating super fast enought to save me :D
---
Yes
---
Thank you. I appreciate it.
---
