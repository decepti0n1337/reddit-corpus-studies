It will seem endless but if you are gonna use it in pvp it will be worth. If you want to make it easier go in the momentum gamemode. Either use a void handcannon or use the duke handcannon since it one shots at mid range in that gamemode.
---
---
---
Is it "kill with long shlong" or "Xol with long shlong"?
---
Are those a50s? How you liking them?
---
It’s really nice. While I’m no professional artist, so you can take this with a grain of salt, I’d say a little more depth given to some parts would improve it.
---
Drop it on the floor and he'll rest in pieces SHAZOW
---
Only so many witches can be hunted at one time. Jotun and Erentil are probably next. MT still has a little time left. Not enough people get killed by it yet.
---
Bruh, thanks for answering.
---
I don't care if he slams into 3 enemies all game, if he's going to run off a base he could've easily captured like that, he can GTFO my team.
---
You just got to find your niche like in other shooters, do you rush or stay back for support? Do you have better control over an auto rifle or hand cannon? Etc. And remember you're going to be killed in crucible it's just going to happen there will always be a better player than you dont get discouraged. You really just have to test yourself in the crucible as shaxx would say
---

I dont have the season pass
---
IKR? Bows slay out in comp if you can hit with them.

*ÿ ë ê t*
---
Thanks
---
Agreed
---
question from someone who still doesnt get the game that well is truth or spare rations better
---
Saint 14 has also been cast
---
If you got the colony go to momentum control heavy ammo spawns rapidly but be aware nothing but scouts so you can’t rush or your gonna get dropped rq I’m sitting at 93% double kills then I get my mountaintop in just 2 days of grinding
---
I don't do day 1 raids every time. I've always enjoyed watching day 1 races. sometimes I attempt day 1 afterwards, or at least welcome another underleveled raid experience because that is soooooo much fun. also would rather lfg raids. I kind of play destiny differently from others and I find a lot of the raid reporters, like yourself toxic. RR tags are meaningless and even the top destiny players mimic the same thought. there's a few people I'd run low man's with. they are positive and chill and won't rage over failure like you do. but I'd honestly rather do solo challenges and help people out on lfg because I'm nice and care about the destiny community unlike you. please stop caring about raid report, it really is a bad indicator of skill. almost all of your low man's were in the mindless auto reload to dps while being overleveled. go run them back post Shadowkeep since your raid report displays so much skill
---
I cackled a bit because I thought the thing to the right was Ikora with a super long neck, I had to have a double take
---
TIL she's also Light Hope in She-Ra :D
---
I want to say A, but my (mostly justified) fear is that once they pick it up they’ll immediately run through the portal before they bank.
---
He is having a seizure....
---
Looks like we have to resort to farming
---
Thanks op! Just seeing this now, but I've been freaking out over not getting a bounty over the last week and a half of doing bounties every day.
---
I Love to run out and slide making snipers waste ammo in comp. I get hit about 15% of the time and killed about 2% or so. (Obviously those are a guess.)
---
It's worth it imo especially at that price wouldn't bother with this season 0ass when there's only 3 weeks left though unless you play the hell out of it
---
I don’t know man, but I guess I gotta give it to guardian b. Taken captains are wayyyyy more annoying than knights.
---
Ritual weapon
---
Okay.
---
I'm not very potent with names and lore. How many knights and stuff are there? I didn't really realize there were so many honestly.
---
It is amazing! I can see if it was like bungie employees and they sent you the gun, but they’re just doing wat u can do.
---
Oh I didn’t know that. Thanks for enlightening me
---
This is actually from the Hong Kong protests, students have taken up bows and petrol bombs to defend themselves from police aggression

Also,  invading helps with medals!
---
I feel that. I had to make a carry in a comp match because our Hunter kept feeding the enemy team, trying to snipe them.
---
Bad ass , I can see destiny being a lot more fun with this music
---
I feel like the pics should be switched
---
You mean vuvuzela
---
The mask is only for the Halloween mask
---
The mask Eva is selling. IIRC it's the one with Rahool's face on it, and the rest are just ornaments as well
---
Oh how do I get that?
---
Doesnt it give you a guaranteed black armory gear that you dont have for the weekly bounty
---
Me too
---
Wait that's illegal
---
Cayde
---
What I would give for destiny 1 trials armor.  Those ornaments are amazing.  My titan had wings on his boots
---
I'm mad that I didn't think of that, that's genius
---
I’ll do you one better, WHO is guardian C?
---
Just wear some Lucky Pants, your luck will never run out
---
Reminds me of the old glitch on Destiny 1 where you could dance on your sparrow while riding it
---
Damn what if eris died in the hellmouth and had been savathun this whole time...
---
Can confirm. Bart rider.
---
Middle tree solar with fusion nades and healing rift, lumina, Starfire protocol, max discipline you can get
---
Higher tiers of armor are better overall. The defense (power level) number on gear can be changed by spending some resources, so it's only really important early on while you are first leveling. Around 900 ish is when your increase in power level will start to slow down, so you will end up sticking with the same gear for a little longer.
---
my problem with bungie and gambit is that they just don’t give it a lot of stuff. yes, we have weapons, and cool armor, and reckoning. but what is there to do if you’re a dedicated gambit player, and have collected all that stuff that i just mentioned? we dont even have gambit tokens, yet we have them for vanguard and crucible. it would also be nice to at least change the way things worked in gambit once in a while. special challenges to get event only gear or something, or ornaments exclusive to gambit would be cool too.
---
The nerf hasn't happened yet,  but if I understand the Bungie news post correctly, it makes body shots less good. If you get headshots it should be the same.
---
Hahahaha
---
Why are the police singling out students? Are they especially active in the protests or something?
---
Shit man I completely forgot Lumina Existed, I've been trying to find builds online rn and all I find are infinite grenade builds for this season.
---
I’ll do you one better, why is guardian c?
---
The war-priest is FUCKING. TERRIFYING.
---
I thought it was an old SEGA controller, lol
---
Random drop or buy it from xur when he sells
---
Lol exactly my thoughts. Makes me cringe thinking about someone playing with that
---
I'm sorry, but I fucking hate titans in crucible
---
Before anyone asks, Yes it was in Comp, I am Fabled 1 in Glory Rank
---
Someone invaded and spawned in on me when I had a fully loaded Truth. Easiest “Not On My Watch” ever.
---
Me as a Hunter vs literally anybody in PvP, including Titans and Warlocks somehow
---
Thats probably the best thing i ever saw on reddit :-D
---
Usually you just need to return to orbit a second time. Another crucible match may also resolve it.
---
I have 5 paragon mods and an invisibility dodge so just as good
---
Those are awesome! Did you make them?
---
Doing this from now on for people that camps that ledge with a scout rifle
---
Ok, now this is an OC Maymay
---
On one guy, and 95%, you either kill them before it matters, or they kill you before it matters. If I’m standing out of cover and I hit a one eyed titan, then it’s not gonna make a difference. There’s a select few scenarios where it could really effect you.
---

---
Also devour is by no means good and is just a straight up better version of post nerf one eyed.
---
Ooh, last wish is a fun raid, but Riven cheesing can get hard.
---
I still miss him
---
You can buy a consumable from ada to guarantee a piece
---
Please god no /10
---
I wish I have a fireteam now.
---
have you tried the arcstrider/liars handshake combo, thats real 1 punch man mode and you dont even need super to do it
---
6th coyote, 5 paragon mods, and top tree nightstalker. Spamtastic invisibility dodges. Goes great with shotguns.
---
I run bubble and rally barricade in crucible so I'm not sure what your on about . Your just mad because you can't see simple solutions like a wall on the point that you can easily counter by just simply jumping over and shotgunning them, because I know for a fact that no map has a point that can be compleatly locked down with a Titan wall
---
No it's not guaranteed to be an armor piece you dont have
---
Actually tho. I miss Cayde so much.
---
But it does give you an armor piece and I have been farming it for hours
---
Dexters dad is new monarchy
---
Peter Storemare as the dead orbit guy
---
Lennie James as Shaxx
---
Any wire fans would recognize Zavala as lieutenant Daniels
---
That's not true. I pulled a piece at 951.
---
I'm glad too, tired of seeing my fellow titans only limiting themselves to that exotic. Mark of Vengeance will still be pretty useful but at least this way you no longer become a raid boss when getting an overshield.
---

ehh i like t black and red scheme but idk how i feel about the prices of armor. the kinda overgrown legs with plain chest and space helmet don’t really go along together. i’d say 6/10 unless you’re going for a specific look of a certain character or something and i just don’t get it

heres a video to help you play titan without the so nerfed OEM because you gonna be slaughtered by all the OP Hunters now.
---
Striker Titans don’t need super, and have absolutely ridiculous lunge range
---
You don't like byf? What's he done to you? I really hope you meant you don't like watching lore videos in general. If you enjoy discovering the lore on your own, that's great. Others prefer some backstory without having to hunt down every little hidden lore item in the game first. And some might not fully comprehend  what they're reading, especially when trying to connect different lore together.
---
Destiny has some really interesting writing but the devs seem to try their hardest to keep it a secret. I like experiencing a game's lore organically too, but in this game you basically only complete those lore entries when you've done some area for the 100th time. I'd have to look up a video guide to complete them, in which case why don't I just look up the lore directly? Same shit.
---
Volundr is fishhook lock.
---
Wasn't there a Youtuber by that name once? I remember him making Battlefield 3 videos back in the day

---
It looks like you didn't read over half of the scenario I pointed out, typical. Plus you abuse Suppress Nades likely 
---
1 round of Fusion Rifle Ammo. He has a shotgun. It's Survival and he is capping the tie-breaker. He has a full health wall. 1v1.
---
Ohhh shoot, I didn’t know that 
---
Thanks for the advice mate! You’re a lifesaver
---
No need, it autocompletes the quest if you are already above fabled :)
---
Thank you very much!
---
random activities ie strikes, cruicible, gambit, raids. etc
---
I’m in this post and I don’t like it.
---
*slowly conjures Slowva*
---
Ur welcome
---
There is one other quest similar to Whisper of the Worm! The first part is called the Fallen Transponder, and then the actual hidden mission like Whisper is called Zero Hour. A lot of guides don't adequately explain how to start the Fallen Transponder, so [I made one here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bmruj0/fallen_transponderzero_hour_frequently_asked/) After following this, any other guide should be sufficient. 
---
There's nothing else quite like Whisper and Zero Hour, but there are a few other hidden quests. The ones available to all players are the Bad Juju quest and the Worldline Zero quest, If you own Forsaken, there is the Wish Ender quest started from Shattered Throne.
---
Put in the attack on titan song before you jump and viola!
---
So Clint Beastwood is actually Baken then...

Lol, fuck outta here with that shit. I never said hunters were op, it's just annoying to see so many people STILL complaing about oem, like dude its nerfed, it's even easier to counter now, like wtf man
---
Where’s Oryx?
---
What? what do you mean
---
hey but then you go into a raid team, help out someone who doesn’t know the encounter and feel good about that.
---
Imagine if there was a Hunter named Randy, and his Throwing Knife 1shot :D
---
(Knife Trick melee ability)
---
I find this whole exchange funny because you are just showing how bad you are at problem solving in a competitive match and then when you are backed into a corner with logic you just start making assumptions to find a way to invalidate others arguments. Just give up
---
If we had beaten that without the wipe we would have finished our first legend nightfall at 100k
---
It is an Easter Egg
---
Classic mix has been that way for me as well. Since it's control, I really don't have suggestions other than follow your team.
---
This is a clash of gods right here
---
Just make missile do 3x current damage to AOE and if you directly hit a target do like 60% of a celestial nighthawk shot to that target
---
Honestly, I think overshield genuinely was the largest problem
---
(*note: I main titan and refused to use OEM once I realized how busted it was).
---
The most frustrating part about OEM (for me) wasn't the advantage gained in the initial engagement, but the advantage gained AFTER winning the initial engagement. I always felt awful when I died to it, because I knew one of my team mates was probably going to get plastered when faced with someone who had double their health.
---
IMO, the wallhacks were only so egregious, because the penalty for dying was incredibly high. I believe that the tracking it gives still lasts too long, but I don't think it'll be nearly as cancerous now.
---
Drug overdoses are no joke
---
I see you’re a man of culture too
---
What that left sides armor tho
---
This armour always reminds me of the Mummies Alive! Cartoon from the 90s
---
920 950 nightfall ordeals drop exotics, i got 2 back to back on 920, 950 they're more common.
---
Its all random though
---
*Laughs in dunemarchers*
---
As a PVP warlock, I must say that I will happily piss on its grave.
---
Ok back to your loadout. you were a void Walker and we're not running middle tree so you could have handheld supernova seems like you are putting yourself at a disadvantage in a comp situation
---
Can you leave a link here the one in your description isn’t working
---
950 Nightfalls I'd like to say it's been somewhere around 25% of runs I get an exotic. Pretty good to grind out on good weeks
---
What
---
I NEEDED MY MOUNTAINTOP OKAY!!??!!?
---
fair fair, any change you could post an imgur link or anything?
---
The hunt is on!
---
I hate the fact its like 50-50 chance to work sometimes -\_-!
---
So you’re comparing a ability on a helm to a super... good one
---
That’s what happens when you run last word in PvE
---
man that's my exact same thoughts about thundercrash. I like the super ability a lot but too much risk for so little damage it's what make it useless in PVE, well with skullfort it has more use of course you have the super pretty damn quickly, especially for clearing ads in gambit and making orbs for your team for example, but in other like more difficult activities ballistic slam its also risky even with skullfort on. I think Bungie should balance thundercrash and make it like high risk, high reward kind of super.
---
What!? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👍✌️❤️
---
Bottom tree is better
---
I rarely gave a shit about the overshield. Maybe it's cause I snipe a lot and and overshield won't do much against that, but it was infuriating to not be able to flank or outsmart the Titan.
---
what sniper is that
---
Titan brain me "What's egg Lord???"
---
Mhm. Regardless of that, what round did you use your super on?
---
The character didn't feel the same after he was no longer fillion.  I felt the same way when ghost wasn't being played by dinklage, and ghost character still suffers from that change.
---
Previous one, had to save the round by shutting a super down.
---
I still prefer my Slow Clap emote. Gets me every time
---
He was always fillion wdym
---
lol  I just commented about thundercrash in one of the comments about it, and I agree, thundercrash should be a super with a high reward for such a high risk.
---
DAMM YOU ULDREN SOV!!!!
---
Ok so that was what cost you the game. You should have given them the round and gotten to the tiebreaker and then guess what? You have your super to use against said titan or were you not in the lead?
---
No it isnt. The models that I have are much higher quality
---
wish to know too
---
It was 2-3.
---
How to get design Veist a gun:
---
1. Pick a stinging bug
---
2. Put the magazine in sideways
---
3. Add pointy bits
---
4. Is the gun comfortable to hold, if yes repeat step 3
---
The second is big Tex mechs energy though
---
So no way to get it now
---
I don’t have Recluse or OEM, and I do just fine. People hate on our class for stupid reasons, lol.
---
I saw someone with almost that exact name once and it was the best day of my god damn life
---
Apparently not. I’ve been a solo player for a very long time, and I’m just now getting into the community. It seems very toxic.
---
Is there a place in D2 that could be used as a green screen or blue screen? How did you get this emote chromakeyed?
---
Thats a pretty good one
---
Dannae worry lad. As a Titan I can still beat yer scrawny arse through tactics and strats. My tactics: Fist of Havok and my strats: shield wall and melee. lol
---
me as a hunter: LOL FINALLY THATS WHAT YALL GET
---
Because he used his abilities, positioning and weapon choice.
---
leap of faith ... shouldnt have had faith
---
big bet, much appreciated. i have no idea how mich effort goes into enhancing an image, small disclaimer
---
Dang, I remember getting a lot of cool hear from them!
---
Why does it always end out this way in comp?
---
Generally not my experience with Titans. Where do you find these Godberry Titans?
---
Weird.
---
It’s sort of something you just have to practice, I spent match after match practicing with Astrocyte Verse before I finally got the hang of it, I died a lot but now I’m genuinely good with it, I did a lot of momentum control while using it
---
Do the Gen 4s have better docking than the Gen 3? I love my Astros, but I hate the Shaq Shimmy I gotta perform to find that special spot for them to dock properly!
---
I mean, we never take into consideration whether the hole feels like sucking people
---
Hold up, if you're only just getting into the community how did you conclude that,
---
&gt;since the dawn of Destiny, titans are the ones that scream the loudest
---
I'm calling shennaneganery
---
Brings: "You got bodied" to another level.
---
This post was invaded by Titan supremacists
---
Wouldn't be opposed to being sucked by the hole.
---
I used the shlong to destroy the shlong.
---
Youtubers. Just now getting into the community on social media. I’ve only been on Reddit for like a month
---
_Ability,_ he used one. And he camped, which is a cuck move
---
I don't use my titan much,  I main a warlock lol. I try tipp play them all though. I have a recluse... it's in my vault.... just got it last week but they are nerfing it now that I have it,  well I just won't use it then.
---
When you look back only to see a ton of motes blinking out and your allies on the other side of the map shooting at the glowing ad.
---
I’m calling it now, MotW right there.
---
Capping a point is camping to you?
---
I still get one shot killed by warlocks even with max resilience armor so I have no idea why you are complaining.
---
What did Cayde say?
---
Go to the barge at Nessus there is a bunch of chest you can open for 5k glimmer each and get like 150 imperials each. Other than that use the consumable that increases the chance of imperials dropping. You can do menagerie it may have a higher chance of dropping imperials.
---
Directly behind a shield with absolutely no thought with the easiest subclass in the game? Yes.
---
Dutch Van der Linde would beg to differ
---
*grave emote*
---
Is warlock bad for PvP? I just started the game so I'm wondering if I should start a second class for PvP
---
All I need is about 10 wins in a row and I'll be there and I will finally have not forgotten
---
Congrats
---
So you hopped on a bandwagon that you didn't even know actually existed? Not flaming or anything just trying to figure out what you're on about since, if anything, your initial comment was the toxic remark
---
Xur sold it
---
Spoopy
---
Take a break, buddy. Getting this worked up over a game is not worth it. Your mental health is more important. Play something else you like.
---
Plus he camped most of the match, crouching in corners and farming my team.
---
Is there a void build for raids or offences or defence
---
oh man, I was on 97% for 7 matches at 1:30am saturday before I had that one game where everyone was grouped together. but honestly i had the most fun I'd had in a while with the fighting lion lol, got real good with it too lol
---
ah yes I totally forgot about the launch damage, you can kill guardians in crucible with that. Also thundercrash has like an area of effect while the titan is flying, like you can do damage by just passing near an enemy, I have done that before accidentally, however the launch and the area effect thingy is not practical imo. I am not sure about the landing damage I don't think I get that part, like  arc explosion it makes after landing? in any case it kind of feels more powerful when the super lands than hitting them directly so maybe it makes kind of sense but I would like if it does more damage on a direct hit like spike grenade perk lol, ~~yes kind of contradict what you just said about the rocket launcher perks heh...~~
---
Back to the survival suggestion, scratch the overshield and knockback resistant that may be too much like you said. So how about if it stun or flinch the enemy for a couple of seconds, especially when you collide with them, so that way you have a couple of seconds to escape from danger?
---
Nono, Titans screaming the loudest was something I’ve just seen from YouTube Titan mains since D1.
---
Just find three others, raids are made for 6 people to do
---
Fucking Kratos scream
---
You know people don't like playing when they complain about the nerf even though it's not that bad
---
Have you never gone against a bow + eriana + lucky pants combo....well prepare to get your anus pierced.
---
This was me earlier after getting Randy’s throwing knife
---
Ah Rosie i love this post!
---
Wait whaaaat? What's it for? I need to be enlightened
---
Let me guess, you’ve never been killed by a titan that has you marked for vengeance? Dumbass.
---
I specifically recall buddying up with a Warlock that match too. Nutty indeed
---
Sadly Im on pc
---
recluse will still be a solid weapon even with the master of arms nerf
---
Still isn't nearly as useful as the handheld nuclear weapon those voidwalkers have.
---
Bungie pls.
---
Forsacken
---
Cayde asked
---
I am going to yee haw to the heavens with my double hand cannons lucky pants and gunslinger subclass and you can't stop me.
---
No OEM? Noob
---
Explosive knives are actually great for getting clean up kills when someone manages to duck behind a corner. That being said, the neutral game feels pretty weak to me, so I prefer other subclasses for pvp.
---
I have a hard time helping because Im not familliar with all ps things, but I do know at pc on steam theres an option of buying only the dlc without the game.
---
Whoa noone cared to ask How is guardian C.
---
No worries. I appreciate the help.
---
1 2 punch + liars handshake + 3 stack combination blow and you obliterate them
---
A tiny little cross that allows you to know when someone is going for a peek so you can slam your bullets into their skull. Totally not and advantage in a 1v1 fight...
---
Maybe once?
---
  
---
Just don't tag people you can't kill.
---
Pretty simple.
---
Titans under-represented as per usual.
---
Zavala at cayde's grave: "WHO TF STOLE CAYDE'S BALLS?!"
---
Boy, he THICC
---
Yeah it's even funnier when they sneak up on you with Wardcliff Coil when you've retreated to the spawn area and then suddenly pop up out of nowhere then t bag you because they chose to single you out for whatever reason, immediately getting gunned down mid bag by your friend who decided to que with you that day and t bagged relentlessly to assert dominance lmao true story
---
Haha in Hive
---
So you played half a game of crucible since Forsaken released.
---
I see that was at dirt cheep
---
The range on it is a fraction of what you can get with a normal glide, though. It's much less useful in just day to day running and jumping. Arguably still less useful in most PvE. In PvP, I can totally see it being killer.
---
Worst attempt at being a spiteful little c*nt I’ve seen in a while
---
Oo someones mad over nothing
---
I dont think Ive seen many novawarps around nowadays. Only handheld supernova, but never their supers. Or the rare times I do see them cast it, they go down so fast. I think they do need a bit of tweaking to make them tougher, they were nerfed hard after their initial go to pvp super phase, and now with the whole supers can be taken down by even one person if they play right stuff its not shocking that novawarp can be annihilated. #warplivesmatter
---
Arguably one should keep jumping to a minimum in PvP anyway, jumping just turns you into one big skeet for someone to shoot at. Regardless of class.
---
How do you even use the division symbol? It’s not on my phone keyboard
---
They won’t know what hit em. Appreciate it.
---
You're probably wrong. 4-5 resilience vs 1 means you can survive one more shot. That can make a big difference in surviving a duel with a thin sliver of red vs dying. 
---
Recovery is great too but it's not instant no matter how much you have. So if someone shoots you dead due to insufficient resilience, you're still dead, even with 100 recovery. Recovery only comes into play if you survive the first shootout that hurt you in the first place.
---
Who pays real money for virtual bullshit?
---
Uh, is that a cheese spot? Can he get you over there?
---
That friendly hunter looking fly tho
---
You Wont see anyone thats Good in PvP thats not Running 100 Recovery. Thats saying something. 
---
In armor 1.0 more then 2 resilience was basically a waste aswell. 
---
You play How you want. Since you are not on my team or clan its just a bonus for me If you dont run 100 recovery. ;)
---
*said no one ever in momentum control*
---
Trace rifles are shit. You clearly are new light.

How do you obtain mod components now?
---
Back then you just dismantle mods and got a bunch of them to buy new ones. The buying part still works even so there must be a way to get more components right?
---
Movie of the week!!!
---
This is Eliel Haapsaari
---
Banshee sells two every week and they cost 10 components each. The fastest way to get them though is the reputation rank-up packages you get from planet and tower vendors.

They should've emoted for the medal instead...

I think I’m remembering now

Ok thanks for the info :)

You can't get everything anymore as example the old Iron Bannee armour is unobtainable and there are many more things that can't be aquirded nowadays.
---
I like Titan bubbles everywhere. The more bubbles the better
---
The muzzle should point towards the enemy.
---
Right !! ONLY hip fire and start around the belly/torso if you have trouble keeping it on someone’s head (also just essentially spam hit the trigger) lol
---
Retardi
---
Amazing.

Rememeber doing this on 950 nightfall boss fight , we wipe so many time , until the lightbud in my brain just lit up , why not we just nuke him down before he do anything . He die instantly
---
Glitch? Its a viable combo
---
Does Unbroken still mean anything?
---
(Baroque)
---
What's the name of the first song?
---
Instructions unclear. Handcannon now stuck in my ass
---
My meeles don’t track :(
---
I’m using synthoceps and my shotgun meele attacks never work. Well not in comp I mean.
---
It's completely random from crucible activities.
---
It's probably my most remembered quote from D1.  You used to hear it all the time, as it was at the start of a strike that often came up as the nightfall.
---
No one knows how to make exos anymore. Also, it would completely ruin the dark tone that bungie is trying to achieve
---
I don't think she'll be a raid boss. It doesn't really fit her character to have a straight up gunfight with us.
---
Thank you!
---
That's what I've been doing, but I'm getting almost no double kills.  I'll try the colony as suggested by another user for my double kills.
---
Cheers for the help I'll try and give that a shot, though I don't think I'll get much time to play tonight and it's gonna leave rotation tomorrow.
---
I can't even get it to load/connect for some days now, personally.
---
Just got through Forsaken yesterday, still sad when loking on my new ace of spades...
---
r/Fireteams
---
Ya know lol could have banged it out in an hour or two. They got ya waiting 4 days or so if not longer depending on your schedule
---
He's the idiot who jumps into me while I'm carrying 15 motes on Kell's Grave
---
It took me a while for this because thing like golden gun have a short life span   I found rockets and grenade launchers during the prime evil takedown the best opportunity.
---
Check Ana Brays inventory.
---
Thx
---
So the game should only drop the exact things that you are going to use? 
---
Right.
---
You can't really steal memes. I'm usually all about crediting artists, but it's a pretty low effort meme made with screenshots from the game.
---
Legit the best nerf. Titan players are too strong.
---
Banshee sells two every day
---
I got goosebumps at that part.
---
Lucky pants isn’t that good, I just find it more fun to use. Like nobody is going to be telling you it’s top tier but if you wanna run around with 17 hand cannons and just never reload then you go man.
---
Nope,not there
---
Traveler slapped them before, it will slap them again.
---
Two slaps.
---
Then go on their web store lots of merch there
---
Nope
---
It's no there that's why I am asking lmao it just ate it :(
---
"Hot Topic"
---
"Well, there's yet problem"
---
use the colony in mayhem after reset, you’ll get it in no time
---
I don't think so. It 2 shot headshots and 3 shot bodyshots normally, with first glance it probably 2 shot bodies but i doubt its an instakill headshot
---
I know the feel.   On one map the guy got over 10 kills from me and my teammates walking out of spawn again and again just to get sniped by a scout rifle.  We tried jumping, sliding, and sniping but nothing worked.  Some how a person got out and killed him.
---
Destiny isn't slept on. Folks just got sick of Bungie being Bungie.
---
Nice a hunter
---
bro no need to post a 100 time
---
Oem is scummy
---
Well, I wouldn't blame them, I only gotten into it as a new light after a ton of convincing from some of my friends. See, I didn't want to touch it because of the Activision controversy from earlier. Plus, I'm no expert on merchandise, but I think it's Bungie's decision not to sell them in those stores.
---
I mean I'm getting a healthy dose of both of those.
---
Bungie's good old "randomly bounce the fck off any given surface cause we say so"
---
Yeah.... Most weapons will tear him apart. He had an immense buildup for the easiest fight in the game. :/
---
RiP.  I'm nut focusing on hand cannon kills now for rememberence. Win or lose I'm bound to get a few good hand cannon kills which at least takes the sting off of getting stomped by a coordinated team while mine plays like bots
---
Pokémon go
---
Pyramid ships:"ight I'm just gonna glass the entire planet real quick"
---
If you're talking void warlock nezarec's sin gives ability energy with each void kill, plus top tier void gives your void nuke seeking projectiles as well as you a charged grenade. Just use your choice of energy weapon to proc nezarec's and you can drop your grenade and super very often.
---
I loved hawkmoon. Our group was actually just talking about it too. Id love to see it return, it was easily my most used handcannon from D1.
---
marijuana on the field, bring papers
---
Maybe it's a compliment wrapped in an insulting packaging with a bow tied to it.
---
My brain hurts.
---
Access Denied
---
I spawned into a game like this yesterday, me and three guys on the losing team had all people show as enemies, we could not do damage or be killed, the last two guys on the team got stomped.
---
Wait was OEM finally nerfed?
---
I want to dismantle my mastereworked OEM but first I must ask will my ascendant shard be returned
---
well, i guess that makes sense. i’m just so frustrated over all this other game merch i see and i just see nothing of destiny. also, welcome to the community!!
---
"can't move for 10 seconds for some reason, then gets fucked by warsat"
---
I think FrostBolt made a build like this? It had the GOS bow with a Quick Access sling + Eriana’s vow + Lucky pants with enhanced Hand Cannon Dexterity. 
---
Basically he would use one arrow from the bow and quickly switch to Eriana’s to clean up.
---
Which new helmet? :)
---
(soz, D2 noob)
---
Why the fuck did I laugh at this. What the hell is happening to me.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Hey, take solace in the fact that the sbmm system thinks you can carry an entire team of people who enjoy the taste of glass panes.
---
I'm XXXDarkSlayerVergilXXx, and I'm just trying to have as much fun in a gamemode I hate as possible so I can get my loot and gtfo :D
---
I'm not a fan of eververse as a whole, but cosmetics really don't matter to me. Further customization would be fully welcomed by me. I likely wouldnt use it, but to each their own.
---
We could just solo the darkness at this point
---
Thank I’ll try
---
You'll get there, no worries. Soon enough you'll be making those clutch manoeuvres that win matches.
---
But take the same imagery and add every single Guardian with their ships. We are in the millions as well.
---
A God Roll means that the gun has the best combination of perks possible for that specific weapon. Since most of the guns drop with random perks, getting a combination of the best ones is considered a "God Roll". Each gun has a different God Roll so Google the gun name followed by God Roll and you'll find which is the one or two versions you're hunting for.
---
Insert “bwaah waaah wuuuh” sound effect.
---
is astrocyte verse needed to make blink effective?
---
I hate PvP though. Crucible is not a good or fun mode.
---
Next update: lion rampants nerfed
---
Now that is a nice background
---
just get good
---
This ^
---
Story of my life this season whether it be comp it casual. I guess you have a point there.
---
If you are really paying just 14,99 for the Shadowkeep Deluxe - buy it as fast as you can.
---
I give it 3 maybe 4 shots with izanagis
---
Outlaw rampage for sure
---
Getting a god roll on a weapon means when you git its random perks you got literally every aspect if the perks you wanted exactly how you wanted them
---
Like if you want a long range hand cannon and get a "godroll" spare rations with all its traits somehow improving your range in some way
---
The traveler was dormant then. It’s active now and ready to fuck shit up!
---
Sins of the past. Nice choice.
---
Recluse is also gonna get nerfed, hooray!
---
The triangles are a visulazation of the darkness. Meaning that op is telling us were fucked cause of the bigger part of the darkness is against the small small traveler
---
Check the subreddit sharditkeepit ...
---
There you can inquiry if a weapon with a certain roll is worth keeping or not..
---
And the Trav didn’t have us before
---
Just send in like 30 oem bottom tree striker titans and feed them crayons beforehand, they will clean up that doritos in a jiffy.
---
Just use a D1 Cabal shield to fling them all to the next galaxy
---
That what clued ya in to the situation. I was like damn I lost and he’s was like no we won. I made him get up (my husband so he’s in the room next to mine) and walk over to verify and nope we were on different teams. In the entire time I’ve played destiny I don’t think I’ve ever seen this happen unless we set up a private match.
---
Indeed
---
I would assume it comes from unlocking all the abilities on the subclass still
---
Is this the next expansion or raid content
---
*immediately dies firing a rocket*
---
Could be, idk tbh
---
I mean the traveller sacrificed itself to fight the darkness so It might die permenantly this time
---
They changed that for Mars, my fireteam wasn't able to start escalation at either location. Ended up trying the playlist until we got 'the corrupted' and did blind well instead
---
Dope, thanks.
---
Dude honestly this game hyped me up so fucking much when thinking about how badass our guardians are. I mean, we killed fucking Oryx in his throne realm!
---
Still im no clear about what about the genesis perk at all.
---
nah bro fuck oem fuck titans LMAO - a hunter main
---
The conclusion to the series??? 🤔🤔🤔
---
These are all awesome! What are they from?
---
Possibly
---
Everyone perma dies and Bungie announces Destiny 3 for $60 for the base game without content and a level cap. But for another $80 you can get the season pass and get the rest of the content.
---
Were you actually in the strike playlist or did you specifically choose a Mars strike
---
You have to be in the playlist

No, Sleepers reign in Gambit is over after the nerfs.

Not really, i don't have it yet and it works fine. But with astrocyte you become untouchable as the cooldown is reduced between blinks so you become crazy slippery.

Theres one of these pyramids atm under moon crust and it completely bamboozles our ghosts and hive alike and gives us halucinations. Imagine what whole fleet of them gona do
---
If you're in a situation where you have to melee twice, you're doing it wrong, also you're basically guaranteed first hit in a melee fight because you have no lunge, do at leat 80 damage and enjoy your free melee kill. (Probably a trade though because melee is broken)
---
OP didn't ask which one takes the most skill.
---
Can you imagine if the trickster booby traps could pop up anywhere but bow they instantly explode
---
It would be so evil and so triggering to think you got an exotic but get a bomb instead
---
The base New Light version of the game comes with the base game + all year 1 DLC (Warmind + Curse of  Osiris). Additional paid DLC's include Forsaken and Shadowkeep, both of which don't come for free with new light. I personally recommend trying the new light version of the game for a week or so, see if you find the gameplay enjoyable and whether it would be worth spending the money on the extra DLC's.If you like the game both forsaken and shadowkeep are great pick ups IMO.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Just a tip though, black Friday is next week (29th November), so if you can hold off until then for possible steam/console sales, I would very much recommend doing so.
---
We were a skeleton crew, then New Light happened where Traveler sheds more ghosts
---
those pyramids are talking mad shit for someone in recluse range
---
We were actually in playlist, ended up going back to blind well once we realized we couldn't start it. It would probably have been ok if other players were running escalation, but nobody ever rezzed into our instance of Mars
---
There's alot of places like this on nesus where you cant actually go unless your in a missions that takes place there
---
The main thing youll notice is when they spin their mouse around as fast as they can, and compare it to a controller user. That's about the only difference you'll notice if you are watching them in a death screen. Mouse can turn and spin faster. Controller is much slower.
---
On point though, no its not an issue. Just play the game and learn crucible. The advantage is mouse can spin faster. But its useless if you aren't already skilled. And in that case a controller would still give you the upperhand on thd newbies.
---
yeah dude for sure you missed it last week
---
We're guardians of the light. We don't get fucked. We fuck

No, it is a quest only exotic
---
Dregden?
---
Ah, meaning no Ace of Spades either :/ ah well...

which one?

I prefer the Fr0st-33S look as it has the purple tubes
---
Also my arms have little green spikes on the back of them so it fits more like a bug.
---
Waaaaaaay up there Morty.
---
This is how they will wipe our vaults in D3: Collapse 2.0.

Not that this is a bad thing because starting over is fine because of new weapons.

I had thunder coil on but it doesn’t one shot, they all had some damage on them, it does like 160 damage
---
The post was showing how he was 1 valor point from 2000
---
I hope they balance it without killing it. It’s like the only good 900 rpm smg
---
It will still be better than every other energy smg.
---
How are people able to aim and fire snipers at people's heads so quickly and accurately? Is it like a youth thing? I'm better than I was a year ago but I still can't quite hit the fire button in time.
---
It often seems like when bungie nerfs stuff they dont really just nerf it they make it useless and its so stupid
---
don't worry, we have 6 more years of content before this arc will be resolved
---
Then they nerfed my baby, Sealed Ahamkara Grasps. RIP friend. You were relevant for a month.
---
To get to the other side?
---
I don't think any new ghosts have been made since the initial release just that New Light is about of load of ghosts finding their guardians finally.
---
i find hard to believe that the RUNT of the worm gods is above the one that killed Akka

Oh I'm sure. I have no idea how to draw digitally, lol.
---
Try that on the wrong hunter and your forehead will be on the wrong end of an explosive knife
---
I don’t use my console anymore for destiny as it runs so much better on pc but this game I still use a controller I’m just so used to playing this game that way. But it’s really not that much of an advantage using a M &amp; K imo if you are half decent at the game crucible will be fine as I’m always top 3

I see damn I already wasted my triumph that gets me an armor piece I don't have.

Hasnt poppud up on r/destinyusernames yet
---
What is this from?
---
i don’t know much about lore really,  but i’m really hoping a bunch of other travellers turn up, like the pyramids are the vessels of the darkness and each one fought a different traveller (vessel of the light) during the war between the light and the dark and the pyramid under the moon is just the one that fought our traveller and lost.
---
Right? I do this with all engrams even though I know it goes to the postmaster if I miss it...
---
Why the hell would you want to fight vex? Those things suck, their critical hitbox is tiny.
---
Whats the information regarding the companion app? It’s been down since reset
---
Hunters with low resilience vs titans with 100

Pre-nerf laser tag with the darkness

---
Lol, just do the bounties. Super quick and you get tons of dust. :)
---
Is there a general preference for what weapons to use as kinetic and what to use as energy? Last time I played since recently was Destiny 1 which I remember having a more clear split between primary and secondary weapons and now they're mixed

it's ok i know a guy calls himself Shepard but he's been through this before we can count on him to save the the last city on earth.
---
I feel like a raid against Savathun should have similar mechanics to LW/CoS. Getting a darkness debuff from Savathun that kills you if you take too many of them or have them for too long (think Morgeth/Witch’s blessing) if you have the debuff and either hold it for long enough, or som something specific with it, it will transform into a buff that allows you to do something new. I really liked the war theme in your encounter, and I was thinking using taken debuffs to your eventual advantage could work well in a raid against the aspect of trickery
---
Well played, but I don't think this is the same if you look from the other side's perspective.
---
Since other team had everyone with lower than 1 kda and a player scoring literally 0 assists, then it'd feel like they got matched against a group of vastly better players that knew how to coordinate.
---
It's even worse when you get a minute to win it medal in solo queue, kinda implying that the match was relatively unfair because your team was able to roll over them extremely effectively.
---
It might not even be like 85%+ in favor of your group like others have reported, but having 65-35 odds for a game is still the result of a pretty terrible matchmaking system.
---
Read my other reply
---
ahaaa.... well, I guess they're not that terrifying now (òvó)و
---
I know right? Primes dont just stop at 950. They roll to your average. Super useful.
---
I have not done it but open to help for sure.   Upper 960 hunter and can run any subclass.   Be on a bit later if want
---
It's just kills with it right? (In crucible,strike, gambit/prime?)
---
Hmm not a bad idea but I’m a zoomy lion rampants titan main so my comfort with the class may drop. Guess I’ll use hunter for the evade reload.
---
Those ships are the darkness. (The enemies that caused the collapse) they were killed when the traveler sacrificed itself. They are back since the traveler is awake
---
Ask if they're really your friend.
---
Where did you get the "secret victories" emblem to drop? Its whats holding me back.... been farming BW.
---
Probably one of the "The Naked Gun" movies.
---
Since there's loads of Pyramids, and they're basically the opposite of the Traveler, do you reckon there could be loads of Balls other than the Traveler out there somewhere? We have one of each here now, maybe the rest are on their way to have a huge geometry war.
---
I will say that nove nuke is better; use something to get lot of grenades. Enhance ashes to assets and controversial hold. Now go kill everything
---
“So, if you could just do me a favor and off yourself, that’d be great. Thanks, pumpkin.”
---
Four story missions is all it will take to defeat the pyramids. Maybe an additional strike that is 70% of the last story mission.
---
That was when shadowkeep first launched lmao
---
It might be in a short future 😉 follow me in IG @embertwist ♠️
---
It's not hard to get 1 kill. Sure they should be matched up against closer skill opponents but when you literally can't aim a shot to get a single kill, there's no hope for you and you probably should just not play pvp or at least don't complain because you want the game to give you a bot match.
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/BungieHelp/ says "http://Bungie.net has been updated and authentication services have been restored. Destiny 2 Companion users may need to sign out and sign back in to the apps."

Just got the essence in a chest while doing alters of sorrow after completing the quest for Sai Moto's necklace fragments. I was hunting for this essence for a week in every lost sector, region and random chests without any luck so far. Not sure if the Sai Moto's necklace quest completion has any bearing on this.
---
That’s for lost memory fragments I think, the sleeper nodes are different I forgot what the quest was called I have for them but when I get home I’ll update if the answer isn’t already here
---
Your there prizoner now if you resist your dead
---
I'm I haven't played in a while and I don't even use it unless a Titan uses it against me but what happened to the one eyed mask?
---
Naw dude. It hits for 164 on a headshot. Since it has a lower zoom optic and is thus easier to use than a sniper, it would be OP if it could one-tap. But you might be able to boost it to a one-tap with something like an Empowering Rift.
---
You realize Prime Engrams drop at your level? They are still very good for evening out your gear. Mine are dropping at 954 atm.
---
You should be ok. Took me 3 seasons to finally finish hush lol. I hated using bows in gambit.
---
It means you got the optimal set of perks or stats on a given weapon or piece of gear.  Most of the time there is clear consensus on the general purpose god roll for a given piece of equipment, for example if you roll any exotic armor piece with a 70 stat total with 30 in rec, 30 in mob and 10 in res, that would be a god roll.
---
In some cases it may be build specific.  ie, On  'One Small Step' a roll with one-two punch, small choke, and grave robber is the god roll of that weapon for several melee builds right now, but it's not particularly outstanding to anyone else.
---
Arc with the Arc battery season mod for best results tho.
---
It might be a client error. See if there is an update.
---
Starfire and using fusions for two healing grenades works too
---
Im not 100% sure but I think only the newest campaign gives exotics, so you would get one from shadowkeep this season.
---
Does the hunters “vanish in smoke”  actually make you invisible in PVP? I usually use it when moving through the more open areas of the map without cover and almost always get spotted as if I wasn’t invisible at all
---
Luna has higher stability and handling as well as a better reload and with recent update to Hand cannon range you no longer really have any advantage using Not Forgotten. I actually was looking into this tbis morning and game across this video which I thought explained it pretty well.
---
https://youtu.be/Y0gJmqmh9JI
---
and savathun’s song...
---
like 3 times...
---
I never played WoW, but it seems the only people who complain about this are ones who came to destiny from WoW. what other games use a transmog system?
---
As far as 8 know you no longer get exotics for completing the campaigns
---
As much hate as it gets, I got an OEM with a 69. Hard not to use simply for the stats.
---
As amazing as another block-ship is....
---
You can just not like a mmo since destiny is hardly an mmo at all.
---
Anyone have a higher res for wallpaper?
---
Well thats a bummer. Are there any early exotics to get?
---
The tribute hall is literally what your asking for lol
---
No recluse is your secondary
---
Banshee 44 sells them
---
Tribute hall lol
---
Ummmm, anyone want to tell him?

Hope we get some more travelers !
---
Drang is based off the Luger. Sturm is the Mauser.
---
Thorkell no stop
---
You mean Vitamin T?
---
Wait... No, thats impossible, IMPOSSIBLE. or could it... No that is impossible.
---
No, we still need to kill the undying mind thousands of times. Then the season ends.
---
Byf has the best "big" videos (like the complete story of destiny, thorn, etc..) but meylin's are better consistently imo. Byf just kinda reads the lore tab to you and not much else.
---
The tribute hall is what your looking for, it is super grindy and painful to get everything though.
---
Noob alert🚨
---
well i was thinking a bit more robust options, like generate specific enemies and then make certain scenarios happen. granted im a returning player and have only gotten the first rune for the tribute hall, but even if it were that robust, it shouldnt be locked behind gameplay. it should be like a tutorial mode, able to be turned on at any time.
---
My name is buff.
---
Swtor, final fantasy, pretty sure diablo has a transmog like system
---
see above lol
---
I played dc online for awhile and you could do it there. It’s an annoyance in destiny but not the end of the world. Seems they are moving in that direction anyway
---
From what I can gather this fix is for Destiny on Steam not SteamLink.
---
Same, anything to remember having the one character I liked ripped away before my very eyes.
---
"It won't be meta, but this is my new favorite thing to do in Crucible"
---
No where did he claim it was his idea. You ok?
---
Ohhh I lile that idea. Let's place them inside rasputins cannons lmao
---
The reason to shoot for 6 is to force opposition to go for headshots vs body shots.  Against a lot of the meta weapons it can extend the ttk enough to win you some 1v1's you would otherwise lose.  
---
This assumes you and you opponent are both good enough that you aren't going to miss, or that you are so closely matched that you are going to miss equally.
---
which is the opposite of what im describing. you would want something like this to help you learn so that you can grind more effectively, you know? not be forced to grind first, so that you can figure out stuff you should already know.
---
I purchased the DLC on steam not Xbox
---
Well you can choose from a multitude of different enemies but not really scenarios.
---
Of the highest!
---
I feel your pain, I’m on 3300 I’m going for NF just to say I got there, it was a slog but I got there
---
The point of exotics looking like they do is so they can be pointed out in crucible. Putting shaders on is bad enough for some exotics. Let alone if we were able to put on universal ornaments. You would never know if that Titan has OEM or not. Without checking everyone in the lobby first which would be a pain.
---
Unfortunately, no
---
Use a 110 HC like a Duke or Crimils. Also, The Le Monarque is really is the best bow for PvP imo.  The 110 can roll with Opening Shot. I've been using this setup on my hunter since I've Le Mornarque in Black Armory.
---
Go through the hell of getting Touch of Malice and then Vault it immediately since it's below average in anything except for King's Fall
---
I'm getting flashbacks to Reach getting glassed by Covenant ships.
---
Similar to Vex invasion, it would so cool to see the pyramids invade while playing crucible or randomly in orbit
---
You can buy them from Xur friday-tuesday before reset. Other than that you can do the diffent quests. Some of them isn't really hard but might take time
---
Yup, just super them.
---
Does anyone else look at old Destiny and Destiny 2 leaks just to see what we got right and what we got wrong? I remember a bungie employee was asked "if you could make a new rarity color, what would it be?" And he answered "black" VERY quickly. I can't remember where exactly i saw it, but it was awhile ago
---
Ornaments work like transmog right?
---
Boi at least your charged melee can one hit kill. It's never been that way for us hunters.
---
Is its speed that much off?  I didn't use it a ton in D1 but did notice a difference.
---
Is the TTK that different between d1 averages and d2?  If not you would guess that less ammo used per kill was a net buff to the pistol.
---
2 words no thanks
---
I thought he just says wake up hahah it’s been 5years though!
---
What do you use as a Special weapon in high-end/endgame content if you use Huckleberry? You're giving up an Artifact Mod, as well as Divinity or Izanagi's Burden.
---
Yeah probably deserves to stay in destiny one for the og’s
---
 He who controls the spice controls the universe.
---
Even then it's not like the campaigns are particularly compelling. 
---
Forsaken was just "uldren killed cayde while trying to escape the prison of elders so let's kill him" the actual interesting stuff with savathun and uldren actually just being a pawn in the plan to somehow create the dreaming city curse is stuff you wouldn't really figure out just by playing the campaign. It's more hidden in the lore books. 
---
And shadowkeep just felt like wasted potential to me. With the reveal of the pyramid they could have really done something cool but instead just made the campaign be 
---
1.  Get to moon and find pyramid and nightmares
---
2. Nightmare drops essence, get this device so we can create a forge 
---
3. Grind for a while since we need to fill time to justify the price 
---
4. Enter pyramid and have the darkness be slightly creepy 
---
Even though the red war campaign had some filler that imo wasn't really interesting (basically all of nessus). They still put way more effort into actually telling a story than in shadowkeep.
---
It isnt getting nerfed until the end of the season
---
For the Mercury weapons Brother Vance sells them by themselves.
---
It was worth it I've had it completed 3 weeks ago cocoon with a 9 round mag is awesome
---
The water is cold, he‘s freezing 😔
---
Make sure you aren’t doing prime! Was wondering why I wasn’t getting the ship(I think?) to drop because he wasn’t spawning and it was because I was only in prime and he doesn’t spawn there apparently...
---
Another row at the top would be chronicler
---
That and there's no way they'd leave it intact without changing how the perk works.
---
Oh much better then! “These are the titans for a couple weeks till nerf hits”
---
Is there anything I have to do prior for him to sell them?
---
I believe that HC is the exotic "Last Word"
---
Everybody hates the boys that are on top!
---
#titanClassBestClass
---
Oh dear God.
---
Yeah it might just be another complaint
---
I’m pretty sure what you suggested was what D2’s story and Ghaul were meant to be
---
It's good but why not just headshot with eriana's
---
That's it! I'm getting me mallet!
---
Don’t threaten me with a good time.
---
*slaps sniper*
---
This bad boy can hold so many Sword Logics in him
---
Not sure. I got them from the prophecies before Shadowkeep but I do see all of them in his inventory for Legendary Shards and Simulation Seeds.
---
Used to run hunter. Got used to the tight turn lock. Enjoy hovering in place now.
---
I eighth this.
---
He is also on pc with no flinch which makes him look good too
---
Why is this upvoted?
---
Another "fortnite bad" shitpost, how surprising.
---
I'm down in Muricaland, and I can't find them here anywhere.
---
Can we get an f for our Sunbreaker order that all fucking died on Mercury/Fucked off Vex world.
---
Honestly, I'm not sure. With that being a part of a quest line tied to Forsaken content, I would think you'd have to do those steps on PS4 for them to count as progress. Otherwise, you'd be making progress for content you don't own on PC.
---
Well no duh, top-subs are slow as shit
---
I did this one play if I can find it I'll post it but bassicly I wiped a whole team with just melee 6v6 I think
---
The secret victories emblem is either an RNG drop typically found doing blind well, or if you do all 6 ascendant challenge time trials you will complete a triumph that gives a variant of the emblem which will grant the base emblem at the same time. The time trials will obviously take 6 weeks to complete if you've done none, but that still maybe faster than rng
---
IM GONNA HAMMER THE F*CKING SUN AND NO STUPID ROBOTS ARE GONNA STOP ME!!!!
---
Don't play Momentum Control.
---
Destiny has a great story hidden behind menus many will never care to explore. If it wasn't for Byf giving me something to watch during lunch I would have never found out about most of it. I'm happy to see him get the occasional pcgamer article.
---
900 is the soft, so blue will not be giving power jump. But they will drop within a few points of level or at level to help creep up to 950.
---
It’s the easiest to grind but to be fair that’s right
---
What shader is that?
---
And gives them breathing room to create solid lore while keeping things to a minimum. At least, that's what I want to believe.
---
Screenshots?
---
I dont remember what Hawkmoons perk was, I just remember using it cause it looked cool.
---
Ok does nobody realize that Eriana's isnt a 1 shot headshot
---
New age black armory
---
They’re trying to embody the spirit of the Holy Randy
---
The guy I picked it off of said it was made a resin
---
You haven't heard of jojo, have you?
---
Wait what? The thorn mission isn't a story mission so it doesn't count, other than what was it?
---
All drops will drop withing I think 5 power levels of your max power. The soft cap just means random blues and purples won't drop above your max power. Increases will only come from powerful sources.
---
Then how would you dominate the arena?
---
Infused it into raid gear lul. Raid gear is way more flex than high star gear
---
Thanks, looks good on Recluse
---
I'd say your both toxic for play pvp as Titan but that's just me
---
I would recommend joining destiny 2 content creators discord communities, they often have channels dedicated for finding a group for all raids or competitive, etc.
---
Settle down there, Thanos.
---
New players go through the old D1 mission at the start of the game now instead of the Red War
---
Finally got mine this weekend after grinding out... probably around 15-20 heroic missions, which seems about average. Completed it using EP and having a great time with it :)
---
Yeh same
---
The problem here is you are presumably plummeting to your death. Now I'm gonna respect your choice because Guardians should be free to kill themselves anywhere, but just saying that the dawnblade could Icarus dash back to the original spot. But you do you man.
---
Do you know how to do the English? And no one ever said he was a pro. "Gonna Wreck some noobs" is a joke. I suggest learning what that is. There are a lot on the internet
---
That too, but I see JR a LOT more
---
Omg wtf that’s sick
---
Awesome! Can you give it a try with blade barrage as well? Unpopular opinion but I think that would look very cool
---
Fuck’em. Wormhusk was immediately kicked in the dick, they had over a year
---
I’m on PC. Why can’t we queue solo?
---
Lol I’ve been using sweet business and it slaps
---
You sound like a dredgen
---
That title is way less interesting than the crystal actually is. So you're telling me it changes colour if it's hit by different colours of light?
---
Can't hear you while you're falling to your death while I'm speed gliding to the edge
---
Aww man running that archology strike for the first time on 920 was hilarious. Just skipping merrily through it murdering everything in sight when I run past the room with two pillars and just get absolutely vaporized by 2 unstoppable ogres and a normal ogre just to rub salt in the wound. Just pop into text channel to type “do not go in there” but by then it was too late the ogres had made their way to the rest of my fire team and they were already dead.
---
Thanks! Also about how many legendary fragments can i reasonable attain if i play 3 days a week? Wondering if worth buying each xur weapon each week or not. not sure how rare the legendary fragments are as a resource
---
To colored pencils
---
If you know you aren't a game developer then don't claim something is easy to fix. And to compare Destiny's matchmaking with other pvp fps games these days they are practically the same solo players with the occasional groups.
---
It absolutely is. If you aren't having issues maybe you aren't good enough for the SBMM to look more than 10 miles from your wifi connection?
---
I use recluse as a backup for my jade rabbit,  Farming for randy's.  I dont feel bad at all.  I earned my recluse, and the grind sucked, I'm  going to enjoy ever murder I commit with it.
---
yeah, gifs of kill cams to change every minute or so.
---
Yes they are. Lol you don't even know how the system works. It is absolutely player hosted that is what p2p is.
---
Ok lets put it this way i get one shot by handheld supernova but im toxic for titan i get hunters dodging my shoulder charge and shotgunning me in the back but im toxic for playing as titan i shouod get reported for shoulder charging people right yep have a good day
---
No problem. Are you new to the game? What platform do you play on?
---
Lame.
---
Not to be political or anything, but what’s an add (new light)
---
maybe you just suck
---
many leople can do leviathan yes
---
Hydra in the Marvel Universe.
---
Hail Hydra.
---
Fairly new, I played destiny 1 on PS4, now am playing destiny 2 on PC started as new light
---
Can you type what the bounty says exactly?
---
I'm excited. Last triumph for my seal.
---
Yeetle
---
there you go
---

---
encounters in the gambit bounty are reckoning encounters, you have to make 4 motes in total and deposit them and then do 4 different waves to get them all. highest rarity motes u can. im tired but im just explaining real quick, prob a little messy explenation.
---
Yeah this is a Lie, Byf is the guy on top, Myelin games is the guy on bottom.
---
Yes my skill level makes other people lag and the matchmaking find people from different continents...genius.
---
I gotcha fam
---
yeah btw its ass now since after shadowkeep even on console there are so many other 150 that are better, lunas shit, not forgotten is vad also but it has range and if you suck with handcannons they can be ok.
---
This is incorrect you get it from either Xur through the random engram or randomly by completing wanted bounties from spider
---
Ssssshhh, don't talk about my tactic out loud
---
They down vote you just for even mentioning OEM, that's how weak their game is
---
I thirteenth this
---
Don't confuse the season pass with any events going on. Holiday events like festival of the lost are available for everyone.
---
The vex offensive plus some other odds and ends is what comes with the season pass.
---
For a moment I thought you had 2 last words and I was super confused.
---
Wtf is happening. So freaking weird.
---
Since I posted this I’ve gained like three or four followers. Welcome to the club!
---
Leave Mike O'Tren alone, his piss makes me stronger
---
If you're new light, i don't think you have access to the last wish raid. So you'd have to find another place where are a lot of enemies are stacked together. Then shoot your shadowshot at them (i used top tree void) and then shoot them with your eriana.
---
Can't let warlocks have anything can you?
---
Straif glide is best movement skill in the game. Change my mind.
---
Yeah, you’re full of it. First off, we were talking about recluse as a crutch weapon because all you have to do is get a kill, and then you can go on a rampage where you murder anyone instantly without needing to aim. 
---
Also, your claim of the last word having a faster ttk is just plain wrong. Hitting all headshots, last word has a ttk of .53. Meanwhile with recluse having master of arms procced, using body shots or headshots since it doesn’t matter. So not only is recluse mathematically better with the perk, its more forgiving too. 
---
And I laughed at your thing about glory. I soloed my way to 3100 in season of the drifter, and am about to hit 4000 this season. Not to mention you can watch any streamer at 5500, and every game you will see at least a couple recluse.
---
WHY ARE YOU RUNNING!
---
I just learned never rush the boss kill.
---
Im still not above 150 because i get teams that get shit on by lunas every fucking game. Or arc staff that one hits every other fucking super. Its bonkers.
---
Tying yourself down to the PvP meta loadouts tends to suck it out more since you're relying on something you know is advantageous against most casual players. In my mind, people who complain about people not using the meta in comp are people who put more effort into getting final blows on already weakened players (kill stealing in general) so they can boast about how they're a god in PvP.
---
In the end, it sucks out the fun for everyone because most people would rather rely on near broken loadouts and complain about people who would rather use loadouts they feel comfortable using.
---
Omg so filthy
---
Hey wait... the last word is the golden gun
---
i do have shadowkeep and foresaken sorry.
---
Yeah it’s solid metal, brass maybe? It’s really well made and has some weight to it. And yeah when you put it that way, it seems reasonable, given that they have to have them custom made through a manufacturer.
---
Almost like 3 you tubers already made this into a video..
---
This set is amazing! Do you mind if I ask where these locations are, if it's not too much trouble?
---
I feel threatened
---
Wow! Nice job :)
---
Idk if the phone you're using is from 1995, but i use an S7 edge with chrome browser and if i click on it, the picture enlarges and i can see the whole thing.
---
I don’t agree, because LITERALLY Savathun responded to the Shattered Throne clear by saying “your win is my win”.  The lore very clearly seems to lean way more in his direction. Not to brown nose but the guy doesn’t seem to be under educated on the way the story is unfolding.
---
Ilthis takes commitment
---
Nooo kidding! At least collecting exotic weapons isn't a major part of the game so it's not a huge kick in the crotch..
---
Like what?
---
Holy shiet - I want.
---
How do you get it I have been running the daily adventure once a day for about two weeks
---
I'm a titan. This is great 😂😂
---
Randy’s range isn’t really good for sitting in the back of the map. More of a mid-range contender. All of this was for naught
---
Da Pyramids
---
Drang, son
---
But... warlocks are the sunbreakers.
---
Me and my dad have this theory that were gonna have to fight him at some point 😭
