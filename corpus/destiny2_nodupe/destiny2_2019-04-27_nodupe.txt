This is no longer a good way to farm exotic engrams, since public event (heroic and regular) loot was nerfed several months back. Take any guide older than September 2018 with a hefty pile of salt, as many things in the game were different before then. 
---

---
Now, the best way to get exotics is to buy from Xur. There is a sticky in this subreddit showing where Xur is and what he is selling whenever he is here. 
---
Once you are above power level 290, you can do the Leviathan raid, which has a very high chance of dropping exotics from the first year of the game (but not from the second year of the game).
---
---
---
I got my luna last season and barely used it lol. Anyone saying it and NF dont need a nerf is equal parts delusional and salty.
---
pretty good...but needs more punching.
---
Get good tho. I got it and faced many Luna‚Äôs, not that hard to counter if you are good at the game.
---
TWO MORE HAND CANNONS
---
Was just adding to the convo. I'll see myself out.
---
Boss stomos say no to number 5
---
I would like that very much.
---
-Am Luna's user
---
You just put whay I've been thinking into words perfectly.
---
it looks really great too - i played a decent amount during curse of osiris and i didn't get it originally - i've put the amaranth atrocity shader on it - looks great - glad people pointed it out on reddit otherwise i'd have not noticed
---
The Thorns we use are uncorrupted versions created by his cult
---
Ok but I earned that fuckin gun not to have them change it later. Like WTF IS THE POINT OF PINNACLE CHALLENGES THEN.
---
People with Lunas/NF aren't saying this because they had to grind to get those without the guns in the first place.
---
Wym?
---
There‚Äôs a problem with bloom on console, that‚Äôs why people only run those 2 handcannons.
---
Only because ace of spades is all people will use now and other op weapons will shine and then everyone is gonna complain about those too
---
This was me when telesto nerf happened.
---
Like they have a lot of cash to drop
---
i played 14 crucible matches today grinding for some "EASY" glory
---
11/14 games there was a portable FUCK YOU waiting around every corner, combine with fastball and it's a goddham linear fusion shotgun
---
I love the revelry
---
We shall see my dude. If these guns see play I can assure you it won't be because they are the top choice, just viable. How can you possibly justify making a pinnacle weapon anything but one of the best options. Whether it's OP now doesn't matter but where they will take it down to is overkill.
---
For NF yes, but Luna‚Äôs is now a fucking trash can.
---
Because Lunas is gonna keep the recoil of a 180 even with a 150 rpm? And its gonna be able to 3 tap at Head Head Body, as opposed to the other 150s which can only 3 tap at 3 consecutive headshots with recoil like a mofo.
---
ace has fucking pulse rifle range you idiot. stay out of range and move while you shoot. people are saying LH/NF were crutches. what do you think is going to happen when they get a 150 that can 3 tap with 2 heads and a body? they were what a pinnacle weapon should be. they rewarded accuracy and good play. now they reward poor play. now they truly are a crutch.
---
For console players, not pc players. Which means there is a fundamental problem with other hand cannons and how they handle. Not these handcannons specifically.
---
I was just thinking of an  melee ability that removes all ammo from your opponents gun (or suppresses for PvE)
---
Just an idea I had, idk if it would be worthless or OP
---
Bring back Trespasserüò≠
---
Yeah but crucible is greenades and ham now
---
When the Mindbender accidentally misses his Hive lessons
---
Rangefinder is better for PvP but I'm looking for that roll too
---
Only problem is that Titan's fists never get sore from punching. Everything is correct otherwise
---
It's for some reason in the EDZ
---
Your cooldown begs to differ
---
Congrats! I‚Äôm aiming for recluse now good luck!
---
Very much! Thanks
---
Look on raid report then
---
As someone who avoids playing comp and almost PvP in general I am sick and tired of being matched up against people who have LH/NF. The guns are very strong and used by generally the top pvp players.  I go into quickplay wanting to try non meta loadouts and I can‚Äôt compete against these players unless I‚Äôm in some Goldilocks situation. 9 times out of 10 they will kill me out of pure skill or the weapon being flat out better than whatever I‚Äôm using. 
---
I know people grinded hard for the gun but it‚Äôs pretty ridiculous when console PvP seems absolutely flooded by the 2 weapons. It makes people who are iffy on jumping into PvP never want to come back when they‚Äôre flat out destroyed over and over. Sure quickplay isn‚Äôt about wins or losses but it should be fun first and foremost, and when you‚Äôre outclassed by the competition over and over it ruins the game and doesn‚Äôt even provide the ability to try and improve.
---
I would love if bungie put a flag on someone‚Äôs account when they get a competitive pvp pinnacle weapon and then only try to match up the owners against each other. People who grinded comp should be used to playing competitively anyway so I don‚Äôt see why they should be lumped into quickplay with whatever player unless the server is having trouble finding players. It would make quickplay much less sweaty for those of us who don‚Äôt want to play the pvp that competitively. I think iron banner should disregard the flag as it‚Äôs expected that it‚Äôs competitive.
---
This is a repost
---
Exactly. PC and console will always have different results in shooters because, PC has no recoil etc.
---
Bought forgotten
---
Not really gotten
---
Unfortunately NF and Luna needed a nerf in pvp because they were giving really good players a VERY easy to use weapon on both console and pc that has the fastest TTK than any other weapon and the only weapon that could rival Luna was TLW in close range as long as you land the three headshots. 
---
It sucks that it won‚Äôt be as effective against supers but IMO they need to make most special weapons be able to kill supers effectively. Heavy hitting shotguns (i.e. Dust Rock Blues and Toil and Trouble) should be a shot &amp; melee combo to kill supers. Snipers like Fate Cries Foul should one tap supers to the head along with Arbalest and other Linear Fusions.
---
I‚Äôm a hunter main but don‚Äôt use blade barrage, and I still feel attacked
---
Is there a warlock one?
---
If they made Bloom and recoil more manageable on console then maybe you would see people challenging themselves or using different guns then there would be no nerf needed
---
Finally got my One Eyed Mask üôÉ
---
I‚Äôm thinking if anything it would make more sense as to put her into a frame like Kadi or Arcite, as I don‚Äôt actually think anyone knows how to ‚Äúmake‚Äù exos anymore and if they don‚Äôt, would also require a current exo to either share a conscience (so 3 heads in 1 which would probably drive anyone crazy) or the original exo would be more or less sacrificed. We don‚Äôt know how conscious transfer works so it‚Äôs impossible to say if that‚Äôs how it would go. But like I said I doubt any current age (new city age, since I refuse to call this a new golden age as we aren‚Äôt exactly making great strides that we hadn‚Äôt before necessarily) knows how to create an exo shell or husk or whatever. 
---
However, a FRAME is produced very frequently and it has already shown that there is something with the frames being accessed by Kadi and... Arcite? I don‚Äôt remember which two but it was two frames, anyway there‚Äôs something planned for them and whether it‚Äôs sky net or them just adjusting one to try and help failsafe, or just better equipping and maintenance is unclear. I wouldn‚Äôt put it past the narrative to get her in a frame eventually, as she needs off Nessus soon since calus is stil chompin down on that sweet nectar rock with his fish
---
The same way i did, and half my clan did. Dedication and patience. LH isnt the god gun the casuals think it is, keep your distance and it'll barely tickle you.
---
If people stopped crying about it or stopped being stubborn and picked up a different gun then none of this would have happened
---
Work in progress. 
---
I was inspired by Bungie's fantastic official Destiny comics and the great lore in the game, and so I'm currently thinking about continuing this project beyond a cover mockup, into a serious comic series of as-yet undetermined length.
---
I have a story in mind, branching off from the current canon events of Destiny 2 (Mara, Savath√ªn, Quria, The Distributary and the Dreaming City, etc.) as well as picking up Uldren Sov's story now that [minor spoiler](#s "he's been resurrected as a Guardian").
---
The main focuses of this story would be: [spoiler continuation](#s "1. his new relationships with people he's Scorned in his previous life, pun fully intended"); and the joint effort between the Vanguard and some other factions against Savath√ªn's plot, as we're learning in our Dreaming City lore.
---
Obviously I'm not affiliated with Bungie, so this comic would become utterly and ridiculously wrong as soon as Penumbra drops, so I'm just gonna call this hypothetical story an alternate timeline.
---
Critique, comments, questions, conversation, other things alliterating therewith, and what have you, are welcome.
---
I also posted this to /r/destinythegame, so I'm sorry if you have to see this twice.
---
It wont be even remotely close to the most powerful primary. What are you smoking? :') even as it stands now there are guns with faster ttks
---
how are they gonna get gear if they dont play. Also ask yourself why are they quitting. No one likes the ability spam chief.
---
As an owner of both, they should never have existed in the first place. They're neat weapons, but they get boring to use. This is especially when you feel as though you have no choice because everyone else is running around with one or the other. I just struggled to finish my Regime catalyst because it doesn't come close to optimal TTK.
---
Ze title goes here!
---
Regardless of whether the gun gets nerfed, the Sweats will move onto other guns and continue to stomp and the casuals will complain for another change. It's pvp and if you don't like It, put in the effort to get good and stop complaining. I'm not behind the whole "get good" idea but the thing is that the same ones who complain also can't compete anyway. People need to adapt or figure out a counter and don't say "there aren't any" . The guns themselves are not unbeatable the only thing that makes luna/NF unbeatable would be the hands of the individual player in which case they can most likely whoop your ass with another gun anyway. I've run into illegitimate NF and luna's and they get beat by the legit ones. The gun itself will not make you better as a player, they only further solidify an already solid player.
---
Pay someone else to log into your account and get the gun for you.

Yours must really suck then. I got it without even going for it

TL;DR, time does not equal skill.

Platform?

what platform are you on
---
You arent wrong. On the way to fabled I'm heroic 2 with one other teammate, our other 2 in the fire team were brave 2 and 3 at the time. We got matched against a team full of mythic 3s...I looked them up because we got stomped that hard...it just currently doesnt work even the way tries to work. Skill based matchmaking would be a decent option, itd keep everyone on par. If you're on xbox you can add me, I'll help you climb to fabled, we have one more to take up there. Private message me if you are. But you're right, especially during the revelry, the player base is too small. I'll match the same team all night in fabled 1 and 2 some nights. And you'll start matching the same people regularly, the phrase "hey, we've played this guy before" comes up quite a bit. Its sucky but idk what they can do about the player base tbh. I'm not saying there arent elitist legend players, but I have quite a bit of friends who are legend who arent bad, even offered to make a new account to help us climb. I guess it's a loud toxic few who are screaming over the rest maybe. The squeaky wheel gets the oil as they say.

Nice dude!

If you like comp, don't come back for a few more weeks lol

They‚Äôre going to work almost exactly the same but with a slightly slower ttk you dumb fucking cunt. A 150 2crit 1body is still slower that a 180 doing the same damn thing so how the fuck does it suddenly reward poor play? A pinnacle weapon shouldn‚Äôt be so overwhelmingly better than every single weapon in the game. When LH/NF make up 30% of all kills in the crucible for consoles clearly something has to be done about them!
---
It's gotta be a visual bug then as it's only available through preorder
---
I still remember one terrible Iron banner, where I faced a team of 4 NLB. Those guys were proper Trials pros, It was headshot after headshot.
---
I left after 3 minutes, probably being killed 50 times.
---
I'm gonna have to with lunas getting nerfed. Though id almost just stick with Ace if I'm going HC.
---
They‚Äôre going to work almost exactly the same but with a slightly slower ttk you dumb ass!

A pinnacle weapon shouldn‚Äôt be so overwhelmingly better than every single weapon in the game. When LH/NF make up 30% of all kills in the crucible for consoles clearly something has to be done about them. You‚Äôre just salty you can‚Äôt go farm in quickplay with a weapon that‚Äôs inherently stronger and harder to obtain than most of the population can get.
---
no, names drifter now

Nobody is saying they're nothing without them.

I‚Äôve done the dreaming city daily bounty everyday since forsaken launch, every weekly for enhanced handcannon targeting for my hunter still nothing. I‚Äôve given up on it but it‚Äôs a daily routine.

I personally think it would be interesting if shoulder charge damage increased over time as you sprint. So it can be one kit kill but you have to run further than you currently do to ensure it.

Oh how the tables have turned, and the mighty...have fallen lmao

Beyond ruining Crucible for the ‚Äúcasual gamer,‚Äù for top-level players you‚Äôre handicapping yourself if you *don‚Äôt* use stuff like NF or Recluse. It‚Äôs just not enjoyable, having so few weapons really be worth using.
---
I was holding out in hopes they would allow a transfer or cross progression. I mean, between Xbox and PC, it should be possible due to not having exclusive content. Wompers.
---
On top of recluse already having a much faster ttk with master of arms lh, nf, and broadsword are going to sit in the backseat for penumbra
---
I started destiny as a whole with forsaken. I Grinded my balls off in crucible to get Luna‚Äôs and shortly after finding a good team I got NF just last week, only to find out it‚Äôs being nerfed... I‚Äôve seen all sorts of nerfs that didn‚Äôt effect me but I guess it‚Äôs my turn. I just feel deflated and not motivated to play anymore so with that let me say RIP Not Forgotten/Lunas and back to OSRS I go lol.

I guess I got lucky, I returned to the game to play the forest and I got some 5 exotic drops

Incoming comments? please be nice. He‚Äôs too young to die.

Its bugged you can't do it yet. Bungie is currently trying to fix the issue.
---
I got like 5 playing gambit
---
Its a known issue, bungo is trying to fix it
---
Bungie already acknowledged that the vex part of the quest is bugged and won‚Äôt be able to be completed until it is patched.
---
can confirm that those don't even show up in the lore, you're just trying to trick us
---
Did ye aye?
---
After they split from Activision, Bungie wont have as much money as before. They are prob firing or "laying off" people because they can't pay them.
---
I must be one lucky duck because I've had 4 exotics in 4 days.... Lmao
---
Close afterburner, use a full system monitor like the one I linked.
---
‚ÄúOgre down‚Äù
---
Farming lore/planetary mats. They put on low level gear so they wouldn‚Äôt affect people who were the appropriate power level wearing normal gear.
---
I can‚Äôt talk about the facts of the changes? You don‚Äôt need the gun to know the stats that are readily available.  
---
Bringing the gun down to 150 makes it far less skill based. It‚Äôs just a more forgiving 150. The fact it has no bloom is honestly an issue with bungie not removing it entirely, not that the gun is actually better. 
---
Why are you trying to exclude a guns use from a game mode just because it‚Äôs a pinnacle weapon?
---
Xur hands them out every weekend. They don't need to drop anymore.
---
Those are not good enough. You can read all the guides in the world but it's not a replacement for first hand experience.
---
It's not like it takes that long to teach a role in each encounter (besides being a plate person in vault).
---
Well it does still use explosives...
---
Wait is shattered throne up rn?
---
Then why load into a forge and go afk? How does that farm anything? I seriously don‚Äôt understand.
---
Or if you're REALLY lucky you could get a fighting lion
---
I don't mind KWTD, it's the morons that expect 20+ clears on a normal run with no challenges or triumphs
---
So shaders, weapons, and anything else that i acquired before this system was put into play were not counted even though i had acquired them? Pretty stupid. Shits already locked behind rng, why make us grind twice for things? Dick move.
---
Log out and back in
---
*OH YES*
---
Basically it at this point it's easier to nerf anything that's too good.
---
A good amount of weapons are actually effective at killing already. Its the streamers who make the pvp arena stale for claiming there is a meta everyone should use when there actually isn't. If people thought for themselves more the variety of weapons in crucible would be different. Another factor is peoples skill or lack thereof. If you suck, then you'd have to use what is considered meta to do any good in the crucible. If you're good you'd still feel comfortable using weapons outside of the meta.
---
upvote for babadook. i could not look away even though i wanted to.
---
It's so strange to me how few Exotic engrams people apparently get. I've had I think 2 or 3 within the past 6 weeks? They're rare but not *that* rare for me, are they really supposed to be that uncommon?
---
Got that the other day while trying to get the mida catalyst.
---
The game automatically puts you back into a forge by itself and sometimes solo if no one is your LL. Upon completion, you'll be rewarded with materials even if you did not ignite the forge. It's a popular method as no one below 600 should really be attempting a forge anyways.
---
See, I wouldn‚Äôt be mad if a pinnacle weapon were gimmicky good like that, but like just a random drop anyone can RNG to get, that‚Äôs kinda annoying imo.
---
Legendary Vanguard SMG from Vanilla D2
---
Wtf?
---
Ok I just blue screens stop code IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL Ill check event viewer.
---
I'll check em out thanks
---
Wow. So like that's it right? Game over
---
Why is it 500? It was only 100 for me and was 7% per completion
---
I love grenade trapping heavy
---
You can also use Jotunn or a good rolled Right Side Of Wrong
---
I found it on light.gg
---
What is the in game explanation for engrams?
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs the cloak.
---
Arms are definitely the eververse armor for this season (Kiyot something). I think the cloak is too.
---
even thou I am not a pvp main player, I do enjoy it. Personally I think the Memento Mori Buff from Ace is gonna help you more than the heal/reload from Crimson. First of all it takes a long time to expire and the dmg buff is very significant. The Crimson buffa are good too, but I prefer high impact weapons, the less hits I need to hit to kill, the better. So i think you have to compare how much you are gonna use the buffs/how good they help you. A different approach would be per hit dmg. If you have great aim, a high dmg/projectile weapon could be better for you. Also I personally dont like burst type weapons. 
---
Im just throwing in some thoughts, hope this helps.
---
What's the bug check code? Should be something like 0x050?
---
Wow I bet you're a real success in life arent you you fuckwit. Oh the game is going poorly. I'm bottom. Im just gonna leave. Do the world a favour and go lay yourself down on some train tracks
---
Yah that looks familiar computer restarted before I could get everything but that looks like it
---
Fighting lion is 200 bounties now
---
It's not 500 times the same event, it's 500 bubbles you need to shoot to make it epic bro.

SAME I wish I could equip multiple titles
---
Naw, just allows me to focus on other grinds. I‚Äôm grinding out Luna‚Äôs right now (ugh to the nerf,) and maybe even Mountain Top next. Or maybe I‚Äôll grind another title. I have Cursebreaker, Dredgen, and Wayfarer already. 
---
I tell you, this was a long time coming. I had all available exotics except Anarchy for a long time. It took me 33 clears before I got it, but it dropped the first week of Season if the Drifter and the new exotics were in the loot pool. Liars Handshake and Stronghold were pretty quick to drop but this was a pesky one.
---
Do you have a USB stick? Download memtest64 and test your RAM.

Being the Sentry does feel like the night watch, no one believes the blockers are coming till they see them.

Bingo, heroic is the fastest farm for that triumph
---
Polaris Lance is pretty good
---
I recently just got 16GB of ram there is no way the ram is the problem I think it's just overheating
---
I got a Praxic Finery (Vehicle) from one of those. Hopefully the next one will be a weapon and not just a vehicle. It‚Äôs a sick-looking vehicle though.
---
The fur is is from the cloak the eververse sells

"they exist" (Bungie 2014).

No ornament?

What your power level at the time you completed it will determine it.
---
Okay thanks
---
Coming from a casual here‚Äôs my opinion, if you‚Äôre good, you‚Äôre still going to stomp people with these pinnacle PvP weapons with a nerf. Nerfing pinnacle weapons vs buffing everything else leads to the same thing, they become closer in lethality. That lethality just makes it a little harder for people who play PvP to kill casuals. People who casually play PvP will still be ‚Äúbad‚Äù compared to sweats.
---
True dat
---
It was a play on words. Pre-Destiny‚Äôd.
---
In all seriousness, I'm suprised at how low their drop rates seem.
---
I played back at launch, but took a break up until about a month ago.
---
Since beginning to play again, I've found *ONE* Exotic Engram. I switched from PC to Console, too, so that means from Level 1 to 50 I've found a single Exotic.
---
I'm at around Light 670 now, and I'm still hoping for a second one to drop. I'm doing my weeklies, hitting up Public Events where I can... but still, drops are so goddamn scarce.

What im really upset about tbh is why is it that hunters do not have an instant kill ability like warlocks and titans in pvp. And im not talking about supers.  Im taking about how titans can one shot kill anyone with a shoulder charge (regardless of what class it is). Warlocks have the mini supernova melee (if they have another then idk about it).  And what to hunters have??   Smoke bomb, uppercut (that barely does half shield damage) and knives. 
---
We have nothing that can one shot another player like the other two classes. And to me thats not fair as a hunter main.
---
Well you gave it your best and that‚Äôs all you can do
---

I‚Äôd suggest hold off till the story finishes, maybe work on side events so that you have information like what Quria or Savathun look like, and so you know we won‚Äôt have another member die. The art is great and I‚Äôve been developing storyboarding with a friend and sibling and it‚Äôs a comedy comic, well multiples, about a store in the last city run by guardians and the speaker. We have a lot of laughs but haven‚Äôt done much since we want to have cannon events affect the store (such as caydes death, uldren, the speakers death, the red war, etc.
---
If you were to do side stories that wouldn‚Äôt effect cannon arts or decisions I would say nobars go for it! But I figured it would be best to bring up that working with story that isn‚Äôt finished can be dangerous both legally and responsively as the fanbase can be toxic at times.
---
Overall good art, I‚Äôd like to see stories drawn that won‚Äôt effect future events but that‚Äôs only my preference
---
Idk but I just crashed wothough blue screening and I
---
There is lots of things but I don't know which one is the error reason
---
I feel like it's debatable whether or not Pulled Pork's guardian even counts as fulfilling the vanguard dare. In cases where either the hunter vanguard's dare is unknown or no one fulfills it, the living hunters decide on a new dare to compete for. So I don't think there is only one option.
---
That'll be fun then
---
[removed]
---
Those would be engrams. The power level of engrams is set when yo earn them. Bounties give items at a power level determined by what you are currently. 
---
The only time this is not true is if you save bounties from one season to another. They can't give gear any higher than the max power level of the season you completed them in.

I haven‚Äôt seen one of these in so long I thought my game was bugged when I found one in my post box

I have given you many things to investigate. You have not given me a conclusion for any of them.

1. Are all of your drivers up to date?
---
2. What are your minimum and maximum CPU and GPU temperatures?

3. What were the results if Memtest64?

Without these things answered I cannot be of any more assistance.
