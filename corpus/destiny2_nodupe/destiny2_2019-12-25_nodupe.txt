The cayde cutscene except its you on the ground
---
---
---
I do apologize for the insult, I've just seen so many heated debates over this that I instinctively went to the insult. And while, yes, they can do whatever they want, they aren't going to bring him back. It is a definite, no matter how much people beg for the return of Cayde. It would legitimately ruin Forsaken and every event past it
---
So i found out. As i told you im a hunter and the exotic i unlocked is for a titan so i cant claim it üòÇ
---
Nah, you should not have 3 one hit kill abilities.
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
But this is just not true
---
This is the way.
---
All of which are the same ability minus some status effects that only affect pve
---
Go on your titan and then on inventory mods? 
---

---
You shouldnt get anything for other classes from drops or engrams, unless from xur.
---
Well done, take my upvote with pride, Guardian.
---
especially because she goes through them like a flash no matter the speed you're going through it.
---
at first she's like "we can't! its too dangerous!" only to literally go a millisecond later "wait i actually do have a plan" as if they were said in the same breath. theres no proper pause between the sentences to actually convey a sense of danger or urgency
---
I feel like at this point no matter what weapon type it is y‚Äôall will complain
---
I wonder if Josuke could have turned her back to normal
---
Exactly, but people are always going to want free shit.
---
I always wonder if those people would like it if people came to their job asking for free shit ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
For the amount of content we got this season for $10 it‚Äôs a fucking steal, so I‚Äôm happy to support the devs of my fav game with a few silver purchases.
---
Oh I meant the weekly bounty, not the challenge
---
I've got two of them. Complete PITA that Bungie appears to have no desire to fix.
---
Back in my day titans didnt use physical weapons. All they had was a bubble and their fists
---
'The corrupted' would like a word.....
---
He‚Äôs not wrong lol.
---
I love this super, especially the activation. Gets most people by surprise.
---
Nice
---
Nice graphics!
---
*Genocide*
---
I stopped playing because I couldn‚Äôt enter a single pregame lobby without being subjected to a bunch of chinese nonsense and autistic screeching
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but i think thats the ornament that comes with the deluxe edition of forsaken, don't know if it was sold in the eververse before though
---
Holy shit. It really does. I didn‚Äôt want to be the guy to point out the lack of recoil.
---
*right amount
---
They didn‚Äôt give them a warlock shell
---
*happy carnage, guardian*
---
Don‚Äôt worry I play with my clan now and we go easy if we are playing randoms and then go hard when we find people like u
---
Grow fat from gifts guardian.
---
This game is not for you kid take your salt and playing fortnite or something. Everyone here is trying to help you learn which stats are better but your 2 brain cells cant process it.
---
There is a reason I only mentioned long range. And why I just don‚Äôt use Malfeasance. :D
---
But did you get a 7th column tho...
---
Sounds like a good way to kill crucible and gambit in a free to play game.
---
Pretty sure all of the supers could constitute as needing no skill, it‚Äôs a super. Either way, the fact that I popped it with such low health could have easily gotten me wiped if I made a poor decision.
---
I just keep going back and forth between orbiting and the EDZ land zone.
---
Isn't there lore that Shaxx secretly watches Gambit matches, at first to monitor them but ended up enjoying and getting into them?
---
It‚Äôs probably the one you got from the saint 14 mission. You aren‚Äôt allowed to masterwork that one for some reason
---
Been playing for months. If you need a macro to do a 180 turn then you‚Äôre not using the right sensitivity. I also have a pretty big mousepad and am able to make long swipes.
---
Gambit sucks
---
He comes Friday and leaves at reset
---
PC
---
And wont be back till friday 12pm est. That's how it works.
---
Xur disappears from Tuesday‚Äôs reset to Friday‚Äôs reset. Once Friday rolls around, he‚Äôll be in a new spot with new gear.
---
Eris is the creepy, silent but still smart kid that knows a bit too much.
---
I'm honestly not about to load up a custom nightfall just for the bounty. I only need 9 more levels on Mars to be done with Fractaline altogether. But thanks for the suggestion.
---
Nah, I'd turn her into a bottom tree gunslinger hunter
---
Fuck!
---
Amethyst Veil
---
I pull it out every once and awhile
---
Toland is the opposite of a badass. Felwinter isn't a Warlock, The Iron Lords barely apply to the class system at all, anyway.
---
I play hunters cause their jump much more easy handle ...
---
HUNTERS BROKEN , DODGE META, INVISIBLE OP, BLADE STORM ON PANIC. :(
---
U right
---
[I did. At 7:00 he starts going over the hammer changes and I'm pretty sure they can oneshot](https://youtu.be/Z_aPmXPqQAA)
---
Sundial
---
I like the actual activity but I haven‚Äôt been in a single game where the other people know what to do and it‚Äôs super frustrating because it‚Äôs extremely easy to figure out
---
Well securing heavy ammo spot is one biggest thing in comp (Survival) if anything this quest line prepares you and you team mates how to do it and how importand map control is and i for one im Happy they did this if its mean better team mates. 
---
Wardiff coil is is sick PvP launcher xur sold it some week ago check your invertory
---
What is that rifle? Looks like a cerberus
---
Some people may not find it funny but they‚Äôre just being a little Calus
---
I remember doing something like this when d1 ‚Äúended‚Äù. It just became a bunch of rows but it was still fun
---
Should probably remove the thumbtack first.
---
Ah yes the skill to use the knife with ridiculous ricochet tracking. Still cool though just salty about the new knife.
---
We need an option to auto dismantle blues
---
Sundial u feckin moron
---
Light.gg is a website where you can look up weapons, possible rolls and hidden stats like auto aim.
---
So the smart emo girl with few friends.
---
You said he was bad for ditching the gun but okay
---
I haven‚Äôt seen a hacker since I moved to PC when  it became available on steam
---
Thorn is an odd one. I can do ok with it, but it's not super consistent.
---
The Last Word however, once I got into the habit of hip firing it, it did work. That's what I used to earn Ace of Spades and Thorn.

Here you go!
---
I was actually like that when I saw anyone could get it at first
---
Hmmm a dps slut ü§î
---
Outlast. A rapid fire frame pulse rifle from m Gambit.
---
Top tree, claws for pvp and sunbreakers for pve, so much fun.
---
What about the frame?
---
Big green circle in the crucible select screen.
---
ahhhh. Thank you, I'm an idiot. Thought the quest applied to any crucible match.
---
The clan tag is in Japanese, but unless you had a video, there isn‚Äôt much you could prove, unfortunately
---
That's so cool dude. I'm actually going to put his right in front of me when I play Destiny. Before I hop on D2 tomorrow, I'll go to D1 and say hi to Cayde real quick.
---
Off topic, but what ghost shell is that?
---
If anyone needs to access it on ps4 you change the PlayStation date by 1 day in your settings leave the area and come back and will work every single time.
---
yeah let‚Äôs steal an ancient cultures traditional dance for our Guardians!
---
hell no
---
Cornel lmao
---
Or an option to auto dismantle blues on pick up. Like D1 with green engrams
---
That‚Äôs honestly all I can see now that this post exists as well
---
If you can afford it, there is a Amazon exclusive Cayde with him holding Colonel, and another Gamestop exclusive of him in his Golden Gun. They sit on my pc desk.
---
Your gun is SO HAPPY!!!
---
I love that you just replied with ‚Äúlove you‚Äù at the end. its the best way to deal with these assholes. I had a CSGO match where one guy would try to vote kick me after every round because I wasn‚Äôt playing very well. after so many times, I just went into voice chat and said that he was a really good teammate and I appreciate his support. that sent him into a flurry of yelling and screeching that got himself vote kicked.
---
Well shit, it‚Äôs gone before I could even get my answer.
---
Warlock gang rise up
---
I want to be able to dismantle phantasmal fragments as I pick them up. don't need the postmaster icon blinking 24/7
---
How so? Just curious,  I assume because there are better options?
---
Marry her
---
We did this challenge again this season just to prove that this was possible without oppressive darkness and the Jotuun exotic as we previously used last season. I really enjoy this encounter and hope you all enjoy the vid as well.
---
I hate that mission just because of her voice. Idk what it is but it just bothers me a lot.
---
They probably have to deal with hunters the most over in Glasgow. Especially after the knife buff
---
I did it an hour ago.
---
Twice in the same strike lol
---
You just have to fast travel there. no need to go anywhere else
---
That's my steam name, and yeah, I do hustle those limbs
---
I still have that Scout Rife, The Number auto rifle from Future War Cult, and the Gravity Slingshot shotgun from Dead Orbit.
---
I got mercy ruled 2 matches in a row and rage quit destiny for the day lol. Me and 1 other guy were the only 2 people trying to cap points
---
I crashed reading this
---
He didn‚Äôt mention anything about the step being hard just unfun did you read the post?
---
ik this but why JUST bring up range? as if that is a good arguement, i am saying Sunshot has GOOD range + can kill quickly in close so it doesn't have the weakness Malf does??
---
Oh god how much I would that controller in my hands , first is Xbox , second , it's stickers and you'd feel it in your hands , smooth for the win *PS4 ftw*
---
Exactly
---
I‚Äôve seen a warlock on console with chaos reach and legitimately using an aim it during it
---
U N T I L  I T  DID
---
What‚Äôs a girlfriend?
---
I'm dealing with teleporting asians on every team right now. It's horrid.
---
Yay that is a shocker
---
omg - just yesterday my team only needed to bank 4motes to summon a Primeval ...three of us stood at the bank watching the teammate holding 14 motes ‚Äî chase a HVT while trying to melee it for that 15th mote.  He got stomped into oblivion and lost all the motes.  **THAT** is Gambit in a nutshell.
---
The right stock was very stiff. As soon as you let go it stopped moving it was very strange. I just see it as a future raid challenge.
---
Reported for playing the game
---
Only stats I care about is mobility, recovery and intellect, and recovery/intellect costs more energy if you take it in consideration.
---
All it needs is a chicken!
---
What is the padoru?
---
Still the most satisfying destiny clip I've seen in a long time. It's probably the most opportune time to yell "GET FUCKED TRASH!"
---
Someone‚Äôs iron banner games aren‚Äôt going as planned lol. Shit happens, it‚Äôs not that deep :)
---
I had a hard time finding a good angle because nobody generally cared about him visually but you can kind of see it in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-26ySzeBsY) video right around 2:44 He's genuinely had id for as long as he has existed in Destiny.
---
It is true, the new ghost actor is a better voice actor for the role, but dinklbot was the first, so he holds a special place for us
---
in D1 you could mix n match to an extent within each elemental class. so you could pick the knife grenade and a couple perkes available to each super, but only solar with solar, arc with arc, etc
---
Lot of people will probably say bite of the fox from iron banner but really its down to preference use what gets you kills i found the frigid jackal is pretty nice
---
Hell spawn
---
Pray that you know no more than that
---
Dismantle Phantasmal Cores Please! I dont use them please take them game!
---
Not sure if you missed his sarcasm but I also agree with you.
---
you think i‚Äôm joking?
---
What do you mean by "deep"?
---
That is called a spending problem. Good job, as recognition of the problem is the first step to recovery
---
Everywhere
---
Can‚Äôt go wrong with the Izanagi‚Äôs Burden. Shit slaps hard. Very good invader/anti invader for gambit, the sights are nice and you can use the exotic perks to absolutely gank the fuck outta some dickhead on the enemy Crucible team who‚Äôs going 10-0
---
Did you have stomp-ee5 equipped? Just wondering
---
I have a steelfeather repeater with FF and MKC
---
You can, you'll get the quest from Osiris at the sundial. I havent finished mine yet.
---
Bro I swear the last few days I break stuff down until I'm above 400 and then the next day I come back in the mid 300s. Last night I know for a fact I was at 398 and I come back to 364. Does buying dailies take legendary shards? I'm literally don't think I'm buying anything besides dailies
---
also make it so that you literally can't grab anything more from rank-up packages etc if both your inventory and postmaster is full.
---
a couple of days ago, i wasn't warned when my post was full while getting Banshee rank-ups, meaning i lost like 6-10 legendaries for sharding because i didn't get a warning/it didn't stop me getting more stuff till i cleared my post
---
And then your account gets permabanned
---
Even with 4 players there's constant dying to ads.. yeah I'd say the ads would win in a Gambit 1v1
---
Very well then. Haha
---
Why did you jizz all over it?
---
WHAT?! YOU USED A GUN THAT THEY PUT INTO THE GAME?! WHAT AN ASSHOLE GO KILL YOURSELF!!!!!!
---
Someone made a post requesting ftp accounts not having access to trials if it comes back, I sincerely agree.
---
Which even does more damage at this point
---
Dunno
---
With a mod my stomper has a stat roll of 69 üôÉ
---
We do what we did with Saint-14. We time travel back to the PoE, bean The Rifleman, and simply knock out Uldren with a fucking flashbang.
---
Colonel Isn't lonely.

He's simply waiting.

Love it, thanks.

---
Warmind and SIVA nice
---
Speaking of that, anyone wanna help me on my firat leviathan raid?
---
Unfortunately, the Dagger can‚Äôt roll with Rampage. Wish it did
---
When I saw YouTube loading, I thought I was being rickrolled
---
Only Fat Calus is getting is pure fucking sugar at this point
---
Bungie has the dumbest fucking idiot's possible choose these mission steps
---
Never did the Mountaintop before they made it easier, huh?
---
Ah, dang. Missed my chance to get it
---
I didn‚Äôt get hit by any heavy but there was a brick on the ground around 15 seconds in. Dropped heavy, too, not like the wall kind.
---
How u put a ring on a controller
---
I prefer the kill clip to two-tap fools within 45 meters that dare approach me
---
Last wish 2
---
Dont dismantle

No helmet gang

fucking awesome

I love this

---
Hm. Coulda sworn I‚Äôve gotten items for different jobs using that before. But I don‚Äôt doubt it. Will try that this weekend.
---
Wow that was pretty clutch but it kinda sucks that all you got were blue items as a reward.
---
Sounds like you aren‚Äôt properly geared for this. Perhaps you should stick to crucible.
---
I did it on my Titan. Do you know if it‚Äôs a universal quest or do I need to do it on my other guardians, because if I need fuck this shit, I played like 10 games without getting a single kill, that‚Äôs so annoying.
---
Haha I am not that mean.
---
*nods head*     niicccee
---
As someone who frequents r/aquariums...no
---
Not anymore
---
sub-750 AFK farming, get your essence
---
Fuck holidays, the bug was there before, they should've worked on that before taking their break, its a main season content.
---
It looks nice, but.. it's still a console controller so you're still fucked.
---
finally bought forsaken and then played through the campaign. postmaster had almost 30 blues waiting for me
---
Im trying for the past 30m, fuck you bungie, you dont deserve a break.
---
sorry to say but i got two yesterday doing all my weekly bounties...
---
^i forgot to mention this

This is the way

I don't know about his but mine came with rampage. I wouldn't recommend it.
---
Help me?
---
Im not a newcomer but have been off for years and EVERYTHING IS SOOOO DIFFERENT!
---
I like that.
---
Thank you Uldren, very cool- wait...
---
Maybe I'm just getting unlucky then, on paper it sounded easy, get the thing, shoot at a point being captured, boom 3+ dead, but in reality it's total chaos when the ammo spawns, supers everywhere, and when/if I finally get it I need to use right away at a guy rushing that spot instead of being able to save for a better situation.
---
Fuck you too then
---
A lot of other loot shooters have a "mark as junk" or "mark for dismantle" feature. Not sure why this can't be implemented into d2
---
Merry Christmas, have some toxic waste disgusted as a human. I got a paragraph sent to me a few days ago by some guy who was mad I was using Cerberus. He said ‚ÄúUse a real gun where you have to aim‚Äù as he proceeds to rush with a shotgun. The levels of hypocrisy is breathtaking.
---
Worst quest part i've seen for a long time
---
They started using burning maul lol
---
Dood... i hate you soooo hard.
---
Please try and get that signed by Nathan.
---
Its a quest to make you able to turn in tokens, nor a fucking pinnacle gun or exotic quest.
---
Yep
---
One: Did you finish the story?
---
Two: Are doing the hunt a second time on the same character or different characters
---
Plot twist lol.
---
My god, im dead inside after that.
---
As far as I know you can still get it whenever. I came back during season of undying after quitting during the black armory and got thorn.
---
LOL im playing Destiny 2 from the release and literally no one helped me.  Got into bunch of guilds/clans.
---
Not a single soul wanted to help me do a raid. So i just stopped playing the game after i finished the forsaken exp. Im off to playing World of Warcraft Classic\retail:-) where people actually want to help. Where you can communicate with people in game. And in game sesions. You dont need to private message anyone to talk to them. But the community here on Reddit is great. The game is amazing. Sadly i left the game cuz i got bored of playing the content solo. (PC) 
---
And i noticed console players are way more friendly. Just dont want to pay for ps+ so i can play online even if i payed the full price for the game. 
---
Marry Christmans everyone and stay awesome!
---
Nope it‚Äôs existed since Forsaken
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be that bad if I didn‚Äôt need 10 rocket launcher kills...
---
3 out of the 4 were energy for me as well
---
Dong of justice LXIX
---
I literally just picked this quest up days ago and have been progressing it, so I'd say it's still very much possible :)
---
Then stop acting like this. You give Titans a bad name. Plus, it's getting old really fast.
---
Nice to know (:
---
Of one thousand pussies
---
Happy hunting!
---
Realistically I'd say no, unless you wanna grind Eva's repeatable bounties for that extra XP then yeah it is. Just grab 5 at a time bake the ones you need go deliver and rinse and repeat until you run out of dawning essence. Takes a bit longer on the quest but you might get a level or two out of it depending on how many materials you have
---
omg how to get amazing dame -.-
---
Okay thanks üôè
---
How did u do it so fast
---
The last time he tried, his ghost ended up rezzing him.
---
exactly, and people shit on me for having a positive opinion about this gun, so there's no reason I can't shit on them for their opinion.
---
Advice - return it and buy a scuf prestige instead. Better quality. Better paddle placement.  Comes with a braided charger for easier xbox/pc usage and scufs have always had better builds than elites have due to the mass hatred for the first one.
---
What's the sparrow called?
---
New Light players start at 750 so that they can jump into certain end game activities. I'm not a new light player but from reading things on Reddit, bungie didn't do too great with introducing new light players to the game. 
---
If you want to start the first campaign (and all the other campaigns) you go to Amanda Holiday in the hanger. (If you're not sure how to find her, or the hanger, you can Google her location.) The campaign should help you understand how to play and what the hell is going on. Google and Reddit is going to be a big help with that as well because there's a ton of stuff that doesn't get a clear explanation in the game. Even as a veteran player, I'm still constantly googling quest steps and what not.
---
I was using the Python from this season's Gambit weapon quest and it worked fine. It took me a whole only because I don't really like/use shotguns.
---
THATS AMAZING!
---
I bet he was a hunter.

"ENEMY HAS A MATCH POINT. MEANINGLESS!.."

"Life is meaningless."

"FOR FUCKS SAKE ERIS, THEY FEEL BAD ENOUGH ALREADY"
---
Yeah it's a know issues. This bow is specifically made for season 8, as soon as S9 started the quest wasn't supposed to be still available to be done. I know it sucks because if I remember well that's the last step before acquiring it. 
---
I'd say hold on on the quest and hope Bungie will make an update so those that have the active quest can finish it.
---
Yeah but it least we got some funny memes out of it
---
Can someone explain to me why using light attacks in Spectral Blades costs no super energy and basically allows you to move faster with no penalty?
---
Once a dude helped me complete a quest without being on my fireteam. I shot in a pattern to ask for help and he followed me lol. 
---
Respect.
---
We need the old D1 armor shaders.
---
He doesn't remove the helmet because honestly, nobody cared about who he was until he put on the mask.
---
Yeah it is
---
&gt; but it just shoots one bolt so it‚Äôs basically a linear 
---
You mean, Jottun is a Special Ammo discount rocket launcher?
---
Oh wait lol I keep forgetting there are two different slide perks
---
But does it one-shot Vorgeth?
---
My now friend who i found in patrol as a level 20 somthing early this year just earned his first title, unbroken. Sometimes i feel like i raised him myself. always help new people, you never know who youll meet
---
just be smart and set up a dismantle macro. i have one for shaders from year 1 lol
---
Destiny was like stop this is too much
---
Wardcliff is way better than Truth... if you‚Äôre one using it.
---
Excuse me, i'm playing iron banner for the awesome looking armors.
---
Oh I can‚Äôt really tell that it was blur. Thanks imma go turn it off.
---
At this point I think that destiny is programmed in a way that they cannot implement this and for example instant dismantle blue drops.
---
Yeah it does that to me not only in Iron Banner but free roam too.
---
People asking for this since release of D2.
---
We are still waiting for the tech being there
---
Inspired by the lore 'The Accolade' bungie released before season of dawn launch
---
Crimson?
---
I want more exotic swords! That knight titan vuild needs more "oomph".
---
Do you have crimson equipped
---
merry christmas!!
---
Jotunn is discount Mountaintop which is discount rocket launcher.

Lies and lies..

Does a thundercrash go through the bubble or will it just hit it?

You don't get away with killing off a Nathan Fillion character like its nothing and expect to have a sweet reincarnated life.

Omg so cool man
---
Sad to imagine that all the people he saved during Dark age are probably already dead..
---
I probably am more innate with the Sunbreakers. For as long as I can remember, I've felt a strange.. connection to the flame, to the bonfire... to the Lords of Cinder... oh wait, shit, that's Dark Souls. The armor of the Sunbreakers felt like home... until. I learned the Code of the Missile. The Fists of Havoc wasn't something that I enjoyed. But Code of the Missile is something that I like. I enjoy flying towards my enemies, like a missile!
---
Jan 14th 2020, Merry Christmas man
---
Yeah but they balanced it to where it doubles your cool down and it can't be stacked with the overshield dodge for arc strider. Void battery isn't nearly as bad as arc battery.
---
How exactly?
---
Just drop a bubble or well on it and hope your teammates aren‚Äôt completely stupid. I did this last night and got my 10 kills in three games. 
---
Also, I think the 10 heavy kills adds a little more mayhem to the quest. Not just stand back and shoot a scout or rush someone with a shotgun.
---
Red crayon set o:
---
Few and far between
---
Best gun NA don't @ me
---
Jan 14th I think
---
I thought so, love it !
---
That would work if my Hunter or Warlock had a bubble...
---
Okok. Thank you. Merry Christmas to you!
---
Okok. Thank you very much! Merry Christmas to you :)

That‚Äôd be me. Legit, TicTactical SF on Xbox. It‚Äôs in my bio. It‚Äôs all I browse LFG for
---
The models are a bit different. While engrams are an octogonal shape, the buff that gives harmony is a circle with purple and blue colours inside it
---
Probably is swimming in crayons.
---
still bugged, any idea how to fix this?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
thanks
---
Now I haven't played forsaken, but from what I gathered, uldren was possessed so his will wasnt his own, right?
---
Gratz on your wedding.
---
Nope, you go through it, it also destroys the bubble
---
That‚Äôs why I said drop a bubble OR well. I saw several hunters firing off a tether at the heavy spawn before I reached that part of the quest.
---
Gotta love that system. Bungie really needs to work on that
---
Imagine being a twinks need with some ults
---
Then don't do it? Simple
---
Awesome! Thank you!

Where is his bullet hole? I'm confused.

In all fairness, they are somehow the most feared thing in this system, I‚Äôm surprised a Warlock who can master the Chaos Reach in flying colors would be afraid of a superhuman missile.

Is there a number/ number at the bottom corner?  That will tell you how many were made. I would be interested in buying a print.
---
Try the curated Bad Omens from the Drifter. It has tracking module and cluster bombs. Should make short work of ten kills.
---
It‚Äôs even worst, you won‚Äôt be able to even get heavy ammo half of the time since the opposing team just sleeps over the heavy spawn
---
Auto correct got me that was supposed to say "imagine being a twink who needs aoe ults"

How are you taking advantage of them? Or do you mean sneaking in there fireteam and redeem bounties?

tbh you're just whining and it's annoying

Not asking for it to be a cake walk I just want bungie to change how power weapons are used in iron banner. If power weapons were used exclusively tog et extra tokens it would be great for the hardcore PvPers who like to fight over it while more casual players can enjoy using kinetics and energy weapons for the quest.
---
Had the same issue when all of my friends and I ran bubble on sentinel titan.
---
Happy Dawning to everyone
---
I had a few times defended a plate(that you have to capture) alone, while other 5 are on the other. Chat was of no use either.
---
Well The x6 damage buff will definitely get one kill.
---
*everyone gets killed by a single blade barrage*
---
The expansions do not transfer across platform. If you buy or redeem a code for shadowkeep on the ps4, you need to buy it again on the steam version.
---
If you have a code for the ps4 version, it wont work on the steam version. I can't say I recommend buying the dlc on every single system, I have crosssave for ps4 and steam as well. The steam version I have the expansions, and the ps4 I don't. I have the season pass, and that does go across platforms. I play the pc mainly, and sometimes I launch the ps4 version and play the season pass stuff, but I can't access shadowkeep or forsaken stuff.
---
It's a a quest for a pinnacle PvP activity it's not supposed to be easy
---
They weren‚Äôt born cool they were born to be gods.
---
Yeah tractor not needed at all, you can one shot her without anyone else doing any damage as well
---
Oh that sucks. When did it change? I'm sure I did it last season unless I'm mistaken.
---
An internal system that we don't know much about but it's similar to elo
---
Well done! Saint 14 would be proud
---
Imagine doing 150 cookies together with the dawning repeatable bounty. All that for 150p extra bright dust.
---
Don't worry it's Crayola 60th Anniversary edition
---
Their my favorite :)
---
l o l
---
Yea it does look neat, that‚Äôs for sure
---
I saw a video like a really long time ago. Where the armor could be ornaments.
---
***Modern Warfare 2 campaign flashbacks intensify***
---
Is there a Siva dedicated Destiny subreddit?
---
That's radical.
---
There should be a setting to auto-dismantle blues
---
Idk what trials is but having paywalled content in the game is bullshit.
---
I‚Äôll take a double order with a side of Warlock Crybaby Soup and Hunter Scalp Surprise.  NOM NOM NOM NOM üòã üòã üòã
---
What im looking for is a function, where you can choose not to have blues dropped after you hit the power cap so i dont have to dismantle 4 blues after each crucible match every time.
---
yep.much better!
---
If you use enhanced hand cannon dexterity, or high handling martyr‚Äôs retribution and reg hand cannon dexterity (potentially if martyr‚Äôs retribution allows it, high handling martyr‚Äôs retribution could completely compensate and give a quick stow speed, idk how high it goes, but it‚Äôs possible on certain guns) , you‚Äôll get a very crispy swap speed. Alternatively, if you‚Äôre a hunter, use lucky pants, you could lead into the engagement with martyr‚Äôs retribution, get a hit and insta swap to crimson with enhanced accuracy.
---
I have made over 500 cookies so far this season. Gotta farm those repeatable bounties while I can!
---
There was ornaments for iron banner armor. Kinda like the crucible armor but that's not a thing anymore
---
*Ratatata!*
---
And a Happy New Year.
---
üëâüòéüëâ
---
If you give her 200 cookies you can equip 2 exotic weapons during the dawning.
---
Thanks lol.
---
Right right my bad
---
Yea but i do want blues for gunsmith shit u know but it takes a long time to clear the postmaster
---
Sorry, I don't recognize your name. What do you know me from?
---
Can I equip 2 rocket launchers tho?
---
Especially for phantom essence, takes half a minute to dismantle one and it doesnt destroy the whole stack either
---
Money
---
This is AMAZING!
---
The struggle hahah
---
I'm still waiting for mine :c (Hopefully it'll arrive next week)
---
Well you get 600 + 1500 bright dust
---
Shadow keep I think. Watch this video around about the 5:25 mark. https://youtu.be/fc5xXweyOjo
---
Amazing, nice job!
---
Since Forsaken there are no mechanics or any thought to anything regarding PVE excluding raids. This new vex raid was probably the most thought through raid imo.
---
Hi. Loot posts are not allowed here. Removed.
---
Hi, we only allow direct captures here. Removed.
---
That‚Äôs outbreak perfected
---
*shaxx voice*
---
Ho ho ho marry christmas, guardian!
---
Yeah they all use pre-existing models. The sidearm that was available during season 3 as the winning faction weapon might be SLIGHTLY unique but it's still based on the Omolon sidearm model. I did find out I never got the kinetic sidearm though which is a bummer. Thought I got everything.
---
Hi, please don't LFG here. There's r/DestinyLFG and our LFG Megathread.

The whole shader system should be reworked. It's easily one of the worst-designed features in the game. Take notes from Guild Wars 2. All unlocked shaders should be in the menu and you could mix and match to get the design you want and then press apply when you are satisfied.
---
Except for the entirety of the sundial and obelisk system.
---
Ill agree on that, but having 10 kills with rocket launchers its obnoxious, you probably gonna play  and be infuriated by teammates that cant defend heavy
---
Easily one of the things that pisses me off the most is when the GAME kicks me out of a match then the GAME scolds me for leaving a match. 
---
It really reminds me of that meme where Andre shoots Hannibal then blames it on someone else.
---
The last smth, Arbalest, etc. Mostly it has handcanon icon. I am playing crucible mix, 6v6. My melee is charged, I play hunter, light blue icon, middle tier where you can spin your stick with C :D
---
Looks pretty cool. Running a server farm or satisfied with just never utilizing all the cores?
---
Right
---
Yes but what happens when he is there?
---
this is the way
---
The only winning weapon I got was from season 1 Honors edge from new monarchy
---
I would love to replay destiny 1
---
That makes no sense. It takes more effort to buy shaders with silver then it does to pull them from collections
---
Tiny text will always make me laugh
---
So did they get that on Etsy?  I was looking to get one from my brother but wasn't sure how reliable the sources there were.
---
Not if you want something good to match all your gear
---
The are three on hit kill melee. Warlock is the handheld supernova, Titan is seismic strike (shoulder charge) and Hunters is the weighted throwing knife
---
I refused to pledge anything but FWC haha. I did DO a single time back when they had the catalysts tied to factions bc I thought I'd never get them. I might've gotten that kinetic sidearm if I didn't pledge DO...
---
they grow up so quickly...
---
If you‚Äôre resurrected by the light your lifespan won‚Äôt triple you‚Äôre immortal as long as your Ghost as your Ghost is alive.
---
Got it from ebay for ¬£56
---
Leave it to destiny fans to complain about literally everything even if its a good thing. It's not like you can't use the same shader on all your armor and just because most of the shaders don't work well together doesn't mean none of them do. Why limit customization even more?
---
Think it was from ebay
---
Upvoted for warlock and Xbox, tempted to downvote for crayon munch.
---
There already is.
---
He's just there. Why does it matter? Everyone already knows where he is. He is literally 10 seconds at most from all the closest spawns. It doesn't really matter
---
That is one fancy gift. Lucky man. Maybe i‚Äôll pick one up someday but they‚Äôre quite pricey
---
Why are you huere then hahah
---
I only grinded for Sweet BUSINESS because During the D2 Beta, my Acoustic Brain thought it looked epic.
---
Mood
---
If you use bottom tree Void Titan, it‚Äôs actually fairly safe. You‚Äôd suppress the entire team, and break the loop.
---
How do ya get it? I know it‚Äôs leviathan but is it a specific boss or difficulty?

You guys were making Ada cookies for a perk? Yeah... thats definitely what i was doing...
---
(Ada one best NPC)
---
It counts as long as you finish the Luna's kills before season ends
---
r/fireteam
---
What's the gear? Specifically the chestpiece
---
Void top or middle tree. Charges grenade. If you use too tree use a scatter grenade. Middle tree turns into mini nova bomb
---
unlike other hand cannons last word is good for close fights. it melts who is near you. so mobility focus builds are good for it. and pick a long range weapon with it .
---
You'll have to get the final blows in any season you hit Legend. So if you drop down now but still get all the final blows before the season end you'll get NF, but if you dont get them till next season you'll have to hit Legend again
---
Prestige leviathan from the Castellum chest
---
I like to die on purpose so i can see who will actually come revive me. Then i spend the rest of the match only reviving those people. Yeah i‚Äôm petty.
---
Yeah I struggle to kill with last word even at close range. It's been over 4 games and I still havent done the 15 hc kills for iron banner quest
---
Kills and legend in 1 season

thanks for the quick reply dude, that puts down alot of pressure :3
---
Dont worry, I'm pretty sure you and me arent alone in this... poor choices of dev team
---
thanks alot for the quick answer, time to farm kills :3
---
No worries dude! Good luck!
---
Christmas kinder guardians will probably be in fewer numbers since the game is FTP.
---
As an Aside, all of this would be fine if hundreds of Iron Banner Tokens weren‚Äôt locked behind this chimpanzee-designed quest, but... they are
---
i agree it is different from other guns but when you get used to it lastword is so much fun. just hold your mouse button and move your mouse down because it sprays up a little.
---
Then let us have more spawn points, you can continue to use your sparrow while we enjoy our spawn points. 
---
Also I‚Äôm generally looking at my character/gear, bounties/missions, etc, during the few loading screens I do encounter, so when it‚Äôs done loading, I‚Äôm ready to go for the destination I‚Äôm arriving in.
---
Please stop flexing
---
I hate playing a warlock, but I still have to do weeklies for triumphs. So my last run through this sundial I didn't shoot anything, all I did was put down rifts, Wells, and revive teammates. I actually had a lot more fun doing that than I did actually shooting stuff.
---
Jesus there are lot of hackers recently.
---
Wait where‚Äôs arbalest
---
I was just waiting for that one guy to kill everyone with a slowva bomb
---
Ty
---
Np
---
Wha would you want to use instead?
---
I dont get it
---
As long as i agree with you, especially for tower, i‚Äôd rather have anything closer than a spawn for Hangar where there‚Äôs one interesting NPC for a season. 
---
Amanda, i‚Äôm looking at you.

agreed. at the end i had like 300 IB tokens it was insane
---
How do you prevent being kicked for inactivity?
---
I only play solo. And I enjoy it.
---
Though reading this sub would lead me to believe I'm the only one that does.
---
Ruining it now
---
I was thinking this last night... The rocket launcher step is asinine...
---
The moon one , last Man standing from Gambit and reckoning, hawthorn shotgun , perfect paradox I think can roll too and the garden of salvation  Shotgun
---
Too long didnt read
---
Which armor set is this? I love the horns!
---
I get what you mean and it‚Äôs not every game where you can even get heavy ammo so I understand ya. But a little chaos is fun. Blowing people up is funny. Lol.
---
I started with pvp and I can say that you can definitely tell when the gear is alot better.
---
Wolves is what in been using, itts just monotonous to just 2 shots, die, 2 shot's die, don't really want to deal with the rocket part
---
Me so Thorny.
---
Pfffff xD  Waaaaaaay to much Light for 1 server
---
Anything not weapon specific
---
Check for specific weapon requirements. There could be Precision final blows, weapon type kills, elemental burn kills, ability kills, or any other manner of requirements.
---
Just open your directory and tab to quests and read the exact requirements for each bounty. If they're just standard kills then there could very well be some bug that's reared its ugly head.
---
Forcing people to min max their armor and build around stats that really don't have much of an effect also counts as forcing people to not play their way
---
153246 right ? didnt you have all 3 keys before you did it ? im on xbox btw
---
I hope this will be less painfully that I expect to
---
That's why I love being bubble titan :)
---
The battery mods now double your dodge cooldown, making it costly to even equip it in the first place, thus making it more balanced. And the synergy with bottom tree arc strider is what made it so disgusting in the first place. It's still strong but nowhere close to as powerful as last season.
---
I know. This was just the spot I picked to screenshot because it was easily identifiable.
---
Or how about just make it so you can do 90% of shit from the destinations menu.
---
The game hasn't been about exploring since lost sectors were cool, which was week 1 of year 1
---
My wife plays right next to me, Both of us are on PC. Master Race.
---
this... is... MARVELOUS
---
Yeah I just 4 matches. Managed to get heavy once and got killed before I could use it. They either need to make it 5 kills or replace it. It's a bit tedious to have to play 10+ (that's being generous) games to get the 10 heavy kills.
---
I feel I might have read somewhere about that being a known bug.
---
Wardcliff Coil. It really isn't that hard.
---
The optimal way to get drunk may be through your asshole, but I doubt you‚Äôre sticking a funnel in your ass whenever you drink

Somewhere there's an underpaid intern in an IT closet screaming because the switches all suddenly burst into flames

Please, Bungo
---
This^
---
I will really miss saint 14 when he goes away (which is almost confirmed at this point) that man had such good voice acting, good character that does stand out and didnt feel like just another NPC, has a badass backstory and overall looks dope.
---
*Lord Saladin wants to know your location*
---
Does this mean it‚Äôs filled with children?
---
Prob wish ender so long as u know what ur doing. If u speed run prob 3 hours
---
Damn dude, strikes and raids gotta be fun as hell like that
---
You can glitch into it from patrol, check cloudlxxxv on YouTube.
---
Of course, and I really enjoyed killing the Crimson's (l)users.
---
It resembles datto‚Äôs streaming area too
---
There is absolutely no way ramming the Obelisk with a sparrow makes it work. It‚Äôs computer code. If it were that simple, everyone would be doing it. You‚Äôre just experiencing a crazy anomaly of a coincidence. 
---
That being said, if it is working for you, keep on keep in‚Äô on.
---
A fallen ate that child...such a shame. All that‚Äôs left is an outline.
---
#DID YOU COUNT THEM? NO, REALLY? DID YOU THROW ^^ALL THE GRENADES YOU ^^COULD?
---
I'm triggered by how he's holding it. (I'm ex-military) üòÖ
---
On top of that I have a bug with one of the two weekly bounties. It's always marked as 'already completed'...
---
When you use meta and your get a gamer moment
---
I played it on Xbox through its lifespan. There are exclusive guns and armor on ps, but you can still play the game on Xbox with just as much content away from a few armor pieces and guns.
---
Just make most of these things menu items, hate walking all over the place to get bounties and stuff.
---
If that's how long it takes you to farm essence, you're doing it very ineffeciently. Get a group and speed run the Lake of Shadows in EDZ. Takes about 5 min to run with 3 people. That's 10-15 essence per run
---
Try it out see what you think!
---
Will do! Unlocked it right before leaving for holiday shenanigans üò¨
---
Well in PVE most enemies have an easy precision area to hit. Cabal, Fallen and Hive have reasonable size heads for you to shoot, not to mention Cabal... backpads I honestly don‚Äôt know what their called are massive areas to hit.
---
Vex is just shooting the torso area which is odd at first, but most to all players adapt to that eventually with time.
---
In PvP well tbh I don‚Äôt know what else to say except aim for the head. I get that‚Äôs not always possible based on where your position compared to the opposing player is, but most players get better at it as time goes on.
---
Imagine if after destiny 3 we got a destiny remastered, like modern warfare remastered. That would be dope.
---
Personally my go-to energy weapon.
---
The range fall off on it tho really drives me crazy in PvP.
---
Good luck, and merry Christmas!
---
I say this every time I wake up
---
You are fine to grind out the bounties, just don't turn them in. Completed bounties don't expire so you can wait until you reach the 960s
---
Just aim
---
I know a lot of people in the military who can‚Äôt shoot guns for shit though. 
---
However yeah he is holding it wrong but it‚Äôs not too big of a deal
---
It can be 3d printed. The guy who sold it used a 3d model _**with**_ working components.
---
Sorry to disappoint but range on HC isn't super worth no more because they capped the falloff range to 28 meters since shadowkeep
---
Awww, dang.
---
Ohhhh, okay. Thanks! Ive only heard rumors, sorry. Im just getting back into the game... i quit around the time warmind launched. Ive returned, bought the DLCs, and am starting it all up again. So sorry, i didnt know. Thanks for correcting me though! I didnt wanna spread misinformation!
---
Lol chicken wing
---
How do u get the blacksmith title?
---
Overusing? It‚Äôs only used twice once in the title and again because the title is repeated in the text
---
Oh wow that's amazing! I really appreciate that!
---
It is tied to do Scourge of the past raid triumphs and all 4 forges triumphs.
