Really it would prolly be Saint but I can‚Äôt renounce my loyalty to Shaxx since he banged Mara.
---
---
---
It's in the lore. Time is only messed up and such on Mercury, so we can't go back and save him.
---
It‚Äôs only mercury that was effected
---
Titans are like onions
---
There have been a few sigils of House of Judgement within the files.. Which I find is odd. Who knows, maybe we'll see the friendly fallen sometime in the future.
---
Role reversal
---
Nice
---
Any chance you could show us more than the first 2% of the canon? You probably get off teasing people, you monster.
---
Was probably supposed to be there on Tuesday but it was bugged since his shotgun was just floating there and they got it up and running by today.
---
I lol'd at Mindbenders God roll
---
It‚Äôs basically the idea that players have a couple months to get it done and the hardcore players will have it done within a week. The good news is that this seasons catalyst isn‚Äôt terribly impressive.
---
Thats great haha
---
And possibly an updated challenge of Elders?
---
Beautiful!
---
Since when can you meet him in the tower?
---
Nah. That was in the past, I don't want another Prison/Challenge of Elders tbh.
---
He has a dialogue about that we are not ready to handle a bird yet. That we have to be more gentle. I thought it was funny. He sounds like the guy from Iron Man 2.
---
I got lucky and a few weeks ago there was a crucible mode called momentum control. That's how I got 250 of my kills. I assume momentum modes come around once or twice a season. It might be worth waiting for one of you're bad at sniping in pvp like me.
---

---
  
---
Body shots were kill shots. So no skill needed.
---
Struggling with my last 30 kills now..
---
If you use Cerberus your spray just means you hit more targets even more times =D
---
Today, just load into the tower and head over to Amanda
---
I've forgotten what my guardian sounds like. This is our journey after all, why cant we speak up about it?
---
Nope. You'd need to givehim your account.
---
Don't do that.
---
"And the helmet stayed on."
---
You forgot to put " 9 times out 10 is a titan "
---
Still an awesome post!
---
The premium track/season transfers
---
And they wonder why PvP in this game is less preferable than cancer.
---
Once you unlink I think there‚Äôs a 90 day wait to re-link (for cross platform)
---
If you aren‚Äôt cross platform then there is no ‚ÄúTransfer‚Äù
---
They sell whole steam accounts I guess
---
We did it! We posted another selfie emote with Saint-14!
---
I have all the expansions and the gold plated vex dialogue still happens to me.
---
Because a story needs fucking stakes 
---
Otherwise it becomes predictable and boring 
---
Especially ones where most of the characters can actually just revive themselves in a couple seconds so as it stands, stakes are normally pretty damn low as it is 
---
Plus it would make the entirety of Forsaken and what made it good pointless 
---
It would also impede on the new storyline Bungie seems to be setting up for the newly guardianised Uldren Sov (otherwise known as the motherfucker who shot Cayde)
---
Jesus Christ... Because Nathan Fillion is unavailable.
---
That sucks
---
I haven't failed a forge since season of the drifter, when I first started playing again...
---
These get posted a lot. It doesn't roll stats for the bottom three so the top three are sometimes nuts.
---
Some get Fallout Plays on BARREL LENGTH INCREASES RANGE
---
I just sit next to the bank and shoot at them till they get an f-ing clue.
---
If you're on xbox,I can help you out
---
Once you collect 15, you have an overwhelming urge to leap into chasms and pits, instead of banking them.
---
Yeah, so I have no idea what OP is going on about.
---
Mans at IKEA
---
I did wait for oem. And i did get it. But... the assassins cowl tho.... 
---
:(
---
Caydes 'funeral' at the start of the forsaken campaign.
---
I haven't gotten into Reckoning and gear sets yet, but I'm totally a Reaper-style myself. I feel much better not holding motes, and I hate when I make it rain and nobody collects. Definitely looking forward to trying out my J√∂tunn on those HVTs now! At least when I can find them, that is, the sneaky bastards are always hiding from me.
---
I‚Äôm Chad AR Ape
---
I just finished my Army of One by using Dawnblade. Then I saw Four The Hard Way and it seemed nigh impossible....until now. =D
---
"yaw, yeet"
---
So your the person who watches me get killed by the 17 blockers while you sit at the portal waiting to invade, doing nothing
---
I got FP (firmly planted, not field prep) and 1-2 punch
---
it's a known bug
---
And he‚Äôs a cute lil guy while in game he‚Äôs MASSIVE
---
Just got finished grinding out the Python quest, and I can say that this translates to Gambit as well.
---
On such moments I regret that you can't invade your own team
---
Gladd‚Äôs sidearms video
---
You get out of school for a cold?
---
Did you get the medal "Not on my watch"? If you get that medal you should have got the progress.
---
Mines like 12 maybe 13 and my man has over 69k
---
Like your spelling
---
But now we can finally kill Fikrul without him going immune!
---
Thanks I was pretty lucky on that one
---
The fanciest one should've spelled crucible correctly
---
I have no idea what that means xD
---
Last hope with multi kill clip does now dps than recluse apparently. Sidearm meta.
---
I think the bottleneck is essence of dawning. You need 15 per recipe until you masterwork the oven, then ten
---
Pinnacle weapons are called ritual weapons because they don't have unique perks anymore
---
I‚Äôm in this picture and I don‚Äôt like it
---
Shaxx and Saint agree to have a drinking contest with only one rule.
---
No ghosts. Not this time...
---
What do you do to change the date?
---
Doesn't help
---
Imagine healing after every super kill.
---
*furious dinging intensifies*
---
At the beginning of Forsaken and throughout the Shadowkeep campaign
---
At this point you're either a troll, moron or both. So I dont have time for you, good day sir
---
Honestly, anyone who AFKs in the forge should have their characters wiped...no joke.
---
Binging aren‚Äôt even that money hungry
---
Bad boy with a rad toy?
---
Go to settings and change date manually. Just change it to 2018 and make sure you're in orbit.
---
Best recipe to spam is anything that requires elemental ingredients as they are really easy to get.
---
Nah man look at him, he even has his helmet on
---
It'd be homo if you didn't buy it, its daddy shaxx
---
Except I don‚Äôt cause it spawns me at the start of the map and I can‚Äôt get to the end in time lol
---
Yeah, then you run into the one guy who remembered Anteus Wards existed.
---
I‚Äôm trying to get strike activities done
---
That really dosent matter it would be fine if he was just laying there i believe
---
Last time I saw a gun this long I was watching Trigun as a teenager https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_CSRRlN2b4

That was my primary back when I was a shotgun ape in d1
---
Gambuse
---
You sound like you‚Äôre a twelve year old, grow tf up
---
Yeah, I'm the one in the wrong. That's why you have no up votes and everybody trashed you.
---
Are you on pc? Is your IGN also el diablo? We‚Äôre you in Nessus by failsafe at around 2pm EST? If you were. I saw you run into the wall.
---
I don‚Äôt know why but I love that name
---
I have not
---
It reminds me of untitled goose
---
Yeah yeah, I know that.  What I want is the detailed description of the ingredients just like before I made everything, so I can see where to how to get them.
---
This is how I feel whenever I have a fun build. I‚Äôve had the most fun in the game playing with builds I just can‚Äôt seem to get a positive k/d on, whereas the boring builds I do well with.
---
I'm a simple man, I see Primus and my name is mud
---
Take an updoot sir
---
Ye I misspelled crucible the first one
---
How dare thou trespass upon our land? MEN! To your crossbows! **Defend the gate!**
---
Thanks dude
---
For real tho fix it üò≠üò≠
---
hi, i would like to know how to acquire such a class mod (thx \^\^)
---
I think aggressive frame does higher damage but has a lower mag/higher recoil. I'm not really a fan of them but if you can get used to them there are some excellent options. Rapid fires are the tits for PvP though.
---
I know.  I have been doing The Stuff of Myth but I can‚Äôt unlock the challenge from Shaxx until I have done the intro quest.  Since I can‚Äôt do the intro quest I can‚Äôt get Recluse.
---
How is it?    I‚Äôm one rank away.
---
Thats some serious grinding if u have all 4 maxed out on week 2
---
He must have found something interesting!
---
Tranquility can roll it but it can't roll triple tap for that sweet perk synergy. I use the Little Light app to see the option on all weapons
---
Random drops :) just like most mods
---
Arblest sparrow
---
Don‚Äôt even have to go to the moon. You could just stay on mercury and still shoot them point blank.
---
Is the season pass the only way to get it? Cuz I don‚Äôt see my myself hitting rank 45...I only hit rank 20-something last season...practically the only reason I‚Äôd be playing this season is for the sniper...
---
Has it been confirmed they're working on D3, or are they going to continue adding to D2?
---
Let me tell you something, The ONLY time someone kills me with a headshot, is with Arbalest. 10/10 probably a fantastic gun.
---
That's me on campaign vs me online
---
It's your decision not to bake cookies for riven. And I'm not shitting on your opinion and look at the other games which sell lootboxes almost roughly the same price and most of the time you get shit you don't want. Some games will give you shit loot coming from the season rewards and we out here getting Exotic Engrams, Bright Engrams that give something useful like sparrows or ornaments. COD:MW wouldn't give good stuff for free and hey literally the Eververse store is selling 80% BRIGHT DUST you can get something you want every week for bright dust which is good!
---
I enjoy
---
Both is good
---
Far from it tbh
---
It would if wish to get was consistent
---
THIS ISNT EVEN MY FULL LENGTH
---
to my knowledge i don‚Äôt think there is a way only searching it up.
---
EP, blind well, alters of sorrow. T1 reckoning is a good farm for the essence. Team scorched is as well.
---
The new python shotgun from gambit is good for damage, except it's your melee that's doing all the damage lol
---
I love showing up to it and there's like 6 guardians shooting the shit out of it like it's a raid boss.
---
That‚Äôs still not the point.
---
He would knee oryx on the balls and spit on his face while smoking a fine cigar
---
Bruh I've had such mixed feelings on Gambit now. Started playing cause I'm stuck on a quest step to shut down an invader, and I've lost count of how many times the opponents are half way through their prime evil, and we need 1 mote but no one is depositing.
---
Why would a sane person grind it beyond 100
---
I‚Äôm 100% one of those guardians
---
he spin
---
Theres not arguing at this point if you don't want to play the game then don't play itm depends on you.
---
That's a revoker, yeah? Is it worth chasing? Why use it over a rifle like tranquility?
---
It might help a little in pvp but not in pve
---
I keep seeing this, what is this referencing?
---
How are you so far in the pass already jeez
---
Welcome to the club and I wont get into my whole mental health situation with you. But OCD can be moderate to severe to running a person's life just fyi. And I do take the time every single time I'm at the tower because I have to that's how I'm wired, but it would be nice if after taking the time to do it she would stop blinking that's all I'm saying. Negative no, you obviously did not read my last reply to you or you would have seen that I have nothing but support for Destiny and Bungie, I grew up playing all of the Halos so yeah I've given them alot of money. I made my point that's it agree, disagree I frankly could careless, it's the internet I voiced what I wanted to say as did you. I am so sick of monetization that yeah it might be bothering me more than you but I also remember when games were released fully finished you paid your 60 bucks and that was it, no microtransactions or anything, God it was great to be a gamer back then. So yeah between OCD and the fact that microtransactions have ruined gaming as a whole its annoying me.
---
It‚Äôs taught me that 99% is not a 100%. Every-single-time it isn‚Äôt.
---
I **need** a nice sparrow like that. How did you get that? How to get a good one?
---
Agreed. Hardlight, Ricochet Braytech Werewolf rerolls, and FL have taught me even corners can't protect me.
---
Bird is like gun. You must eat.
---
Might be worth noting that to get the forge to maximum temper you need to destroy 2 little drones that spawn after wave 1, before wave 2. They look like the ones around forge saboteurs and those forge boxes close to them.
---
If I'm not in the mood to teach I just say 'kwtd'. You don't need to show an emblem or anything. It becomes pretty apparent if someone doesn't know what they're doing after a couple of wipes.
---
Thorns good, ace not so much people say its better on pc. I really like crimson with the catalyst, thorn is pretty much best exotic hc in the game. Dont have last word cant comment on it
---
Aet yous systems tome ahead a few hours while playing the game and it will load you into a solo instince and it will work
---
Saint would‚Äôve clapped Ghauls rhino cheeks
---
Just leave the area and come back, if someone is around that hasn‚Äôt unlocked it yet you won‚Äôt be able to interact with it
---
Not great at pvp? My handheld supernova says otherwise
---
So i found a work around thats still frustrating a little bit but i at least got my characters back but not my expansions... i had to make a new bungie account then cross save the psn account. Ive got my characters and gear just no expansions...
---
I was able to open the folder! These shots are PHENOMONAL and part of the reason I sometimes just wander around the planets on Destiny doing whatever before I go so something purposeful because it's really beautiful.
---
[Amazin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0mVLPViGRI)

Good job [Jlly] clan member!
---
I had a good laugh too.  Thanks!
---
This is cute!!!
---
The scream When I got bodied by enemies
---
You forgot Gary
---
Can't you just abandon those?
---
Since I'm bad.. I listen to their death wail whenever I got bodied by enemies
---
Not sure what's your timezone, but for me he's been there since Friday night, I think! (rn it's early saturday)
---
It's beautiful. Tears of joy are rolling down my eyes.
---
Because the devs want exotics to be somewhat hard to get?
---
I love the sound of arbalest. It gives away their location so I can blow their head off with Revoker. Heh. *Said in my head* Your right to live and kill has been revoked.
---
Bungie: buy forsaken and shadowkeep instead.
---
im mst. so its 2:07 am for me on Saturday the 21st
---
Irk about triple but there is definite increase in infamy progression rn
---
Of course it is. It's better than tranquility for pvp in every category other than RoF.
---
Sad but true I'll get it soon tho
---
What if they do around the same as I am when we're together and worse when alone?  But I do worse with them?
---
There is a lot of out of map spots on nessus, and its green cause the skybox on nessus is green in places
---
Wheres "deleteVEX.exe"?
---
I knew it
---
Also, this guy is on mars
---
Just so you know I live In the UK so we are probably in different time zones
---
 well on reddit, it‚Äôs more of a points system
---
Every 100k nightfall from Bungie fire teams FML
---
Just because you're good at the game, doesn't mean everyone else is. You also have no right to insult people for not spending as much time as you likely do on fps games.
---
I, personally, don't like playing against shotties because I can't deal with them in most situations (I get flustered and whiff all my shots). It feels spectacularly unfun to see a guy turn a corner and then just die because I keep mis-timing my jumps, or because his connection is better than mine.
---
That really really sucks.
---
 :|
---
But, MORE spooky aliens
---
Dude! Great job! I'll definitely use this.
---
What does He say?
---
McXcuse me
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
Grinded out python (and infamy reset) over a day, top tree arcstrider with liars handshake, one two punch shotgun, tractor cannon and whatever primary I felt like (mostly Randy‚Äôs or black Scorpion, sometimes claws of the wolf). Make sure you run regular gambit as 2-3 round games with lower health enemies will make it a lot easier to rack up 30-50kills per game. 
---
Use one two punch for majors and try to only melee red bars if you need health or are trying to refresh combination blow. Only focus on getting kills, act as if there are no motes, only bank any you‚Äôve picked up if you are crossing the bank towards the next enemy spawn.
---
If you have taken/hive/fallen armaments abuse the F out of them, tractor cannon can easily kill 2-3 enemies close to eachother in 1 shot unlike special slot shotguns. I also used special ammo finisher + pump action when I wasn‚Äôt running armaments, try to use your super energy for generating ammo mostly because you don‚Äôt want to slay enemies with it that you could‚Äôve shotgunned.
---
Python is def worth it tho, I‚Äôm on a 13 winstreak now because I kept playing for a bit after I obtained it to see how it would perform and I can tell you, having an aggressive shotty with up to 12 in the mag (overflow+backup mag) that boosts your melee damage significantly is N.A.S.T.Y. 
---
Have been #1 on enemies killed consistently
---
Threat Detector &amp; Lead From Gold. If you have a GL loading perk regardless if it‚Äôs enhanced or not that‚Äôs the most it could do. So any reloading perk on the gun itself is basically useless unless it‚Äôs Auto-Loading Holster.
---
Sweet Victory
---
Thanks for the tips
---
You can also get an empty power slot after you get all the seals for the acrius
---
Arbalest is proof that if everyone uses one weapon and only one weapon it will become annoying even if it's worse than the current meta.
---
He killed himself in a church while putting the kid outside of it.

---
Lol, another mouth-breather that camps - get some skill man.
---
is tru tho
---
" BUG "
---
The quest to get it? Or for the catalyst?
---
Mynameisbyf made a really god Video about it
---
He‚Äôs Russian
---
But then you die from J√∂tunn and/or Erentil...
---
Did it come with crayons as well?
---
The thing with shotgun is, it doesn't really requires high skill to pull off, but it does require high skill to counter. I've seen "they can be easily countered" argument countless times but that's debatable. A lot of crucible maps are littered with debris and covers every 15 meters, so it's really not that hard to close distance to an opponent without exposing yourself.
---
For players with average skill and map knowledge shotgun is really hard to counter because their positioning and map awareness are not always on point.  And the reason why you keep seeing a lot of shotgun post is because a lot of players are average. Shotgun might not be a problem for pros, but it is for average players. So yeah, you just have to deal with the posts.
---
So you rely on a crutch?
---
Should  be Ghaul since he killed the speaker. Nice meme though!
---
Isn‚Äôt that revan from kotor/swtor
---
Mine are a combination of I'm trying my best, did I just do that? And FUCKING ARBALEST
---
I need that finisher
---
Arbalest isnt even good. Literally just the quest is causing people to use it. A few will decide that they like it and probably keep using it but its not problematic. Sniping is still way better in every way. And if youre going into control/clash to win games and expect your team to be good then your expectations are the problem. Most people are there using weapons they arent comfortable with for bountys and quests. Nobody cares about winning
---
... well if that's your take on this thread then "ok", I guess
---
My brother encountered it last night. We fast traveled to devrims area and sparrowed back to the gulch a it let him interact.
---
I hope saint stays he has some of the best voice lines in the tower IMO
---
I got the bombardiers on a team scorched playlist no less üòÇüëè
---
Bring back that dreg pistol
---
Arbalest more like Arbmolest am I right?
---
So the revolution begins
---
Cant argue with that
---
A shy vex.
---
I have been a warlock main until I found that hammer. The hammer is love, the hammer is life. Plus that burning maul melts everything.
---
This is a guardian that wants to die but his ghost keeps reviving him.
---
Spent 3k yesterday. Didn't even get 1
---
You don‚Äôt wanna know what I did .
---
Exactly you don‚Äôt have to buy them. So don‚Äôt complain that it costs money. Plus we get new content when bungie makes money
---
Main reason I want glowing shaders is because I can put them on weapons now. Especially on my goldtusk so I can have a lightsaber.
---
You killed him didn‚Äôt you :(
---
Doesn't wish ender only do the bug in PvE?
---
That's messed up üòÖ
---
Even when 10 mote blockers are harder to kill anyways with all the moving they do... ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I had to use 1k voices to kill him other guns didn‚Äôt work :(
---
I noticed one of these... :( 
---
 So here take this... :D
---
ah ok, makes sense now , thanks
---
But it redirects me to the steam site, so idk
---
It's an exotic emote from awhile back. I want to say it was around launch? Either way, probably not available anymore.
---
Bleuberrie boy Luna
---
But then warlocks wouldn‚Äôt have a ‚Äûthing‚Äú anymore
---
Xbox
---
Yeah well I‚Äôm not good with Luna in PvP so imma use it for PvE and other activities. Sorry
---
hah another one for r/DestinyDadJokes
---
We've been asking for this since we had one put in the Annex. I highly doubt that we'll get one, though we have more reason for one now. Just like we should have 2 more for the Dreaming City.
---
[deleted]
---
Getting those sweet ricochet OHK in crucible is the best feeling ever.
---
Like 3/4 of the game's content. Thank you anyway
---
Yes it works but often also after more jump on the zone, and it gives the same problem also to the other obeliscs. So thank you
---
You have to do it 3 more time for a triumph for dredgen. And the triumph has to be you doing it
---
Vandals with wire rifles laugh at this gun

Play neutral range with a hand cannon, fusion rifle, auto rifle, or range heavy SMG. Just keep distance and avoid hugging corners. Pretty straightforward.

Ugh it's a grind I'm only at 6k infamy and been playing all week. And only like 1/3 on the envoy prime kills.
---
What? I‚Äôm sorry, are we still talking about Xur‚Äôs exotic gear on rotation? He sells one weapon and one armor per class/week. You mean to tell me he was offering you what you described? 
---
I‚Äôm sure I am not following. Help?
---
So thaaaat‚Äôs why it kept shuffling around in comp.
---
I was wondering what if Saint gets some kind of crucible like activity what would it be.
---
If this is the same person who‚Äôs been constantly posting in this sub about the eververse icon flashing every single day, please stop.  get over it.
---
Okay 3 questions 
---
Why? 
---
Will it come back? 
---
And where can I buy it then?
---
Crayons are not for eating. But that's just like, my opinion, man.
---
Perfect. Thanks!
---
My apologies. I rated myself down to compensate slightly.
---
Thanks!
---
Wait for Momentum, then you just need to hit them anywhere.
---
It has been going on for last 2 weeks.... east coast here and my buddies and I get the boot alot lately and all at the same time. Definitely some server side issues going on..
---
I got his gun with multi kill clip and feeding frenzy it‚Äôs really good
---
I have one with feeding frenzy and swashbuckler and it reloads so fast I don't care that it only has 49 bullets in the mag.
---
I think it's one of the better guns for a while. Comparable to a kinetic recluse.
---
I literally thought of this last night
---
Yes, except MIDA was my gun of choice. Still waiting on that damn catalyst.
---
Tower SRL map
---
*hear...
---
And why would you want to put in a paywall in any game? Nothing is uber...
---
I didn't realise how quickly d2 loads on pc compared to my ps4 with an ssd installed in it.
---
Yeah I got Forsaken a couple days ago when the steam sale started and I was dicking about with the new Subclass codes and the code of the missile is the one I loved the most 
---
God bless titans
---
Maybe because it contained three season passes one of which is over and one of which is underway.
---
No.
---
You can't.
---
Bruh how do i get the next seasons then....
---
INDEED
---
Before the new light thing started Ghanaian dropped you down from his ship and your equipment got destroyed. You started with 0 Power armor and 0 power kinetic pistol
---
Sounds boring after the first hour or so.
---
I miss the mustard gold shader.
---
Well it can be annoying... but I think the EDZ sundial issue has taken priority atm
---
Your ship should be parked there too ü§≠
---
Second word: truth
---
Don't forget how at the last wave everyone suddenly forgets they're supposed to focus on killing nightmares, letting them speedrun their asses into sacrificing themselves. 
---
Yeah, you've gotta kill adds to get the timer up, but that ain't worth SHITE when every sacrificed nightmare nukes said timer into the negatives in no time.
---
Trevor srl map
---
Let‚Äôs get it! I‚Äôll be on today. Might get in soon tbh. YungCobain92 is my GT
---
That's still pretty slow, idk why it takes so long to move me in an area that's already loaded.
---
r/madlads
---
You probably use Arbalest, don't you
---
The SotP Servitor times a thousand basically
---
I dont mean the black fragments but the the essence for the weapons
---
You can buy the season passes individually from Eververse
---
I mean the difference is immense. My PC's game drive isn't even an SSD, and the fast travel still only takes like 10 seconds.
---
**YES**
---
Jeez Louise, why can't it be like forsaken annual pass was
---
Because of 1 NPC? They wouldn't do it... ;-;
---
This is what happens to all titans when Saint-14 comes back.
---
Weapons out in the tower.
---
Imagine not using chaos reach to kill champions smh my head
---
That or it has Viniq vodka. Which has glitter in it.
---
Is this suppose to be good?
---
Yea idk the rest of the run but when that blender starts spinning you better damn well know I‚Äôm jumping into the spinny blades bud
---
He better not, only the sundial should have to sundie... al
---
Just keep reloading the area
---
Subsistence still
---
I get at least one or two almost every time I do a 920 platinum nf.
---
Thanks, looks sick
---
Yeah I‚Äôll be honest I never tried to Google it but I did ask my clan mates and none of them knew what I was talking about so I asked about it on here. I‚Äôm still pretty new to Reddit and I didn‚Äôt even know you could look up threads, but only Reddits and subreddits.

---
Also I believe Black Armory introduced the first Black + Red shaders into the game. Both of which being New Age Black Armory, and Midnight Smith
---
Will anyone help the poor soul?
---
Dicks out for the Tower!
---
Ok that was uncalled for
---
Idk, it's been a long time
---
So true üòë
---
Also true! I feel like if you had all those ingredients you‚Äôd feel like a wizard
---
Like your boy saint 14 obviously needed help from a warlock to get put of the forest alive.
---
Damn right it does
---
Yes, you are the one he speaks of. The one he looks up to, idolizes, and tries to emulate. You were the example he tries to follow. The one who inspired him to be everything the Last City needed him to be.
---
And here you are, belittling the Titan who saw you as his hero. How far you have fallen to make light of the man whose only goal was to be like you.
---
That whiffed melee was all my crucible pain
---
If I am not mistaken, there was a deadline for signing for Cross-Save, so if you are now past the deadline, the linking will not work..
---
I might be wrong tho.
---
Kill the final arbiter first
---
What did your mom say?
---
Cause its pretty
---
As a titan you should have said this way 
---
*ahem* 
---
THIS IS AMAZING!
---
You mean the Warlock who traversed time itself to find him? The same Warlock whose only regret is not being able to find him? That Warlock?
---
Haha, she doesn't have a say in the matter. Im a grown ass adult capable of making my own decisions.
---
Yeah technically that is correct. Even though its weird to think that our character actually exists in the lore lol.
---
I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs encouraging this but to my knowledge there is an in game issue regarding linear fusions being able to obtain heavy through special ammo pickups. 
---
It‚Äôs annoying but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs on the players to not use it as much as it is o the devs to fix the bug. Let‚Äôs be real for a second, any competitive arena, gaming or otherwise, you‚Äôll find people taking any advantage they can get. I personally would rather win every match with gun skill than an obvious bug but that‚Äôs me. That‚Äôs not the general populace. 
---
I think the more you post this type of content though the quicker Bungies response will be so I would encourage you to continue. I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs against the rules to manipulate in game bugs like this; I could be wrong. It‚Äôs unfortunate but it is what it is.
---
Wack. Congrats though!
---
If youre 920 you should have some good gear anyways. Not to mention good weapons
---
Lmao yea I can understand that
---
Why did you get it upside down? I always want to be able to read the tattoos on the inside of my arm myself
---
What can ya do?
---
Context? Idk what you‚Äôre talking about Guardian.
---
To me 9 out 10 times fast travel to exactly same spot next to obelisk worked. 10th time I had to do it twice.
---
Who's this Xiv? Is he a female X√∫r?
---
Is it jackdrawss? :)
---
I don't have a recluse, i don't have a good hand cannon. So no, i don't have good gear.
---
Easy to inflate numbers if the other team has a bubble titan. Damage against bubbles is over inflated
---
14 in Roman numerals unless I messed up the order of the letters
---
Yes.
---
Who farms glimmer?
---
Thank you. Does the story only progress for the host of the fire team?
---
Don't go to orbit, just respawn at the fast travel point. Turn slightly and beeline for the obelisk.
---
I read that it's players that have NOT completed the quest, in each instance, will prevent you from interacting with it. Just respawn repeatedly until you get it, worked for me within a minute.
---
Yeah it's actually insane. It takes like 7 delivery bounties to get a full season pass rank (guiding light ghost and shared wisdom).
---
As long as you have glimmer, the XP is endless
---
That's normal if you fight the current
---
[removed]
---
If you use a controller, after every shot, pull down on the right stick. After a little bit of time you'll get used to it.
---
Bad internet?
---
This is a wholesome comment
---
Underrated comment
---
r/sharditkeepit
---
?
---
So go get them. Like everyone else did. If your complaint is just "I'm new and other people aren't," well, welcome to online gaming I guess.
---
No sweetener at all? They should at least done a simple syrup, that is probably fairly bitter
---
Two very supportive dads
---
If anybody wants the template, it‚Äôs from this video
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
---
lmao
---
This is the way.
---
It'd be hilarious if this is the only emote this happens with, and it only happens to non-Titans.
---
Voice actor of Saint-14 is Brian T. Delaney. It is in the new credits for Destiny 2 and in Brian's Filmogrophy
---
Ye man, go get them. It's not like i have to play that specific mode where i face more experienced players to even get that gun i want to face more experienced players with..
---
Power level means nothing in crucible the advantages is turned off
---
The joke
---
You
---
They have mechanics that aren‚Äôt explained to you and they require 6 people
---
I only know the ones on Nessus, EDZ, Mars and the Tangled Shore atm. I don't have access to a PC though to look for things in the game, as I'm on vacation.
---
Just try to fuckin stop me. I want that butt flap.
---
The eris morn shell from last season would be better, do farming on the moon
---
Some new lights might find it useful or those who do not want to spend material to get glimmer from spider. :)
---
You also need a rock to hold left click and ur good
---
Restarting the game, leaving the planet and going back, fast traveling to Devrim and then back...none of that worked. Waiting didn't work. The only thing that worked for me was fast traveling to that spawn point over and over again until I could finally interact. And then it kicked me out and stopped working. Fast traveled again, got it working.
---
Does Demolitionist proc Multikill clip, as in you throw a grenade and the reload from reserves proc it? If it doesn't then it's garbage so Rampage/Demo would best. But if it does then that can be very good in a fast grenade regen build.
---
I hope Saint-14 stays, but I don't think he will, and that sucks.
---
Thanks. I went to Amanda and there are three ‚Äúlegacy campaigns‚Äù... red war and two others. Should I do them in any particular order?
---
That was my favorite thing to do push the ball to the crucible npc. Wedge it in the corner of the stairs (that led to the IB npcs) and you could dance on the ball while it spazzed the fuck out lol. It still works now. I recently reinstalled D1 for nostalgia and tried it. Shit people still invite me to raid when I show up in the tower on my titan in full on space dildo armaments. I miss crota best raid ever. Wotm worst raid ever lol did hard mode once for plat never again! It wasn‚Äôt too bad once we got it done xD.
---
Turn it in into ESCAPE ROOM like with all the puzzles and shit
---
I work full time and my friend and I had a race to see who could hit 100 first. We both hit it the other day and I won by 3 levels even though he is on break right now. Now I flex pigeon emote and full ornament set on people in gambit and crucible.
---
I was actually going to lfg for it over the weekend, I got to the boss in the dungeon solo a few weeks ago, but was slightly underleveled at the time. In 966 now though.
---
If you are offering I may take you up on it!
---
I tried. I respawned at the obelisk about a dozen times, then returned to orbit about a half dozen times, then restarted the game 3-4 times before finally getting the obelisk to work. Twenty minutes to get a freaking quest... smh
---
Com'n Bungo. You've know about this issue for a week. Fix it!
---
Adapt, its easy to counter
---
I'm on xbox and PC! I'll be available tomorrow night and monday! I absolutely love doing pit of Heresy. While the xenophage quest is very different, it is still tons of fun. 
---
Have you done the statues and lamp lighting?
---
I got it with Rangefinder, Full Auto Trigger and one other perk I can‚Äôt remember atm. I masterworked it like two days ago and then proceeded to get about 400 more kills with it lmao
---
Ok, how?)
---
‚ÄùIf your Titan remains enlarged for longer than four hours seek immediate medical attention.‚Äù
---
-warning label on my Gjallardoodles
---
yep same
---
The ordeal strikes also have a greater chance of exotic drops when completed
---
Possibly I've seen too much
---
Bungo give us that fast travel
---
Did I kill you in comp just now with it? LOO
---
Bruh dawnblade lasts like 8 seconds
---
Reddit was glitching out for me yesterday, so this does not surprise me. :/
---
Sure, but that doesn‚Äôt protect me from the rockets
---
A video showing how to actually get to the wish wall for new players (like me): https://youtu.be/IsJIc7vyxsw
---
He took the helmet to commemorate the previous owner, a mandalorian huntress who was killed while she protested against the genocide of the cathar (a race)
---
Welp... farm soccer was always better, more people.
---
I suppose the release order red war&gt; curse&gt; warmind
---
Curse is a skip in my opinion
---
Dang. Guess I got lucky.
---
He a bit confused but he got the spirit
---
if you do the glimmer/shard/mat swap at spider you can near limitless glimmer
---
The helmet stays on
---
Keep fast travelling back to the gulch and trying it
---
No, no. He‚Äôs got a point.
---
True true. I guess some more variety would be nice. Tbh I forgot about those haha
---
&gt; gamemode where hunters and warlocks get to hide from titans who can only ~~headbutt~~  punch
---
You mean normal crucible
---
Is that for thorn ?
---
is this a joke im hungover
---
I dunno, man, I still look at old stuff I haven't seen yet and I still don't like spoilers for them.
---
No just a regular strike
---
That‚Äôs just a placeholder. That‚Äôs been a thing forever on every location with every vendor
---
Thanks. Final question.... it looks like the beginning of red war is single player only for a while.. if I go through the intro part and then invite my wife, will that allow her to jump straight in? Or will she need to go through that intro 30 mins or so first too?
---
Don't they all literally tell you what they are if you hover your mouse over? I don't understand this post.
---
Indeed
---
Giant robots and ninja mobility? Grappling hooks? I dont think theres many titanfall haters out there lol.
---
IzaCat is best but whisper with cat is close if you hit all shots. Firing line snipers don‚Äôt even come close
---
Alrighty thank u!
---
Thank u!
---
no, if you receive the riven quest just discard and buy another one
---
Usually when I fast travel, I just check my phone or do something in the background until the fast travel is completed.  
---
Seems more time efficient than running
---
I just spelt it wrong but it is an actual gun
---
psst. if you're ever full on glimmer, buy some blue transmat effects from collections. amanda can turn 3 of them into one purple one, which you can then dismantle for some of the glimmer back and a legendary shard. it's cheaper glimmer per shard than spider
---
Soooooo Unlucky üòÇüòÇ
---
Hahaha so true.  
---
It‚Äôs not OP imo.  
---
I main top tree hunter (always have) with Gemini‚Äôs.  
---
Sometimes the dodge (disorient) will have them back off.  Maybe once outta 10‚Äôtimes.  
---
Nade and smoke if I see it coming.  I would say shottie in most cases can counter.  But I play revoker/NF (I know sorry). 
---
So best I hope for is a panic no scope body shot and melee just to trade lmao.  
---
And these are all if u see the charge coming.  
---
Because titan charges  are like velociraptors.  
---
When you think it‚Äôs coming from the front... they attack from the side.  And never saw it coming.
---
A man of fine culture I see
---
Like I said, Arbalest is a gun, I've had it since it dropped. Not whatever you spelled.
---
Trails of Saint-14 I guess?
---
This was from the season pass btw
---
Was it in the modification section? If so you opened it not dismantled it.
---
If you don‚Äôt have another shell with guiding light, then yes
---
Just keep at it you can do it took me few days to. Good rolled trust for solars ps4 Crimson has sick aim assist for head shots. GL
---
Never too late now, you'll start at 750, getting to 900 is pretty simple, then you can get to 960 which bit more of a grind but not really at the same time
---
I'm gonna try that tonight. Never been to the raid
---
It's easy, you don't even need to kill anyone. I did it earlier too having never done a raid.
---
This is so realistic but I didn't know people were having trouble with the tower obelisk
---
Helmet doesn't come off for either of them
---
Exactly.
---
But the hanger is for storage and maintenance not arrivals.
---
I'm usually the guy clearing the blockers so people can bank
---
No yeah for sure thats the impression i had from the first one and figured it would be more or less the same thing for this one as well, having to pay for multiplayer is just bleh
---
You can get 88 from armor in the season pass. Comes at 66
---
Yes, Titans are special, but Saint-14 is something else
---
I'll do you one better, make it based on your performance the previous match. That way it's something you "earn" but it doesn't favor no lifers
---
just venting, sorry, trying not to be mean
---
Wait what!
---
Please trim your videos
---
Try a different character maybe? Idk what to tell you
---
Appreciate it, bud
---
Eh. I use a cheap Corsair one I got for free, but it doesn't matter too much. 
---
Just make sure it's big enough to be able to control recoil and move your arm kinda thing. Some people like the full mats too
---
Hard mouse pad vs cloth/soft is a thing too. I have always used cloth, I don't think it makes too much difference
---
It cost you 0 dollars to say that but you did anyway.
---
I have a   66 base chest piece
---
RNG
---
what about the dreaming city? Or a couple spots on Nessus
---
This actually made me laugh out loud, lmao
---
Ghost parks it.
---
Hunters are plebs
---
Do you think the blue light around a ghost when a guardian is down might be their form of protection? Perhaps a round of a weapon of sorrow would be enough to penetrate it, if it were protective
---
I seriously don't get why people shit on Zavala, he's a cool character and he's a good leader. People started hating on him because forsaken and all I can say is that he was handled it the best way he could so the city wouldn't be in danger.
---
Isn‚Äôt ‚Äô it an exotic quest after enhance? Or is that just sturm.
---
Ok I'll keep this in mind!
---
Unless I'm imagining things
---
üò≥
---
Enjoy!
---
I put forth effort. I just suck and dont have a lot of time to play.
---
I know right? You can do a hc frame there in just two runs
---
I get ya my guy, I spent so long farming an outlast it hurts.
---
The main reason they probably don‚Äôt have a higher or guaranteed drop chance is because, like you said they didn‚Äôt want people playing prime for grinding out those weapons. Spare is (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) dropped on both weekly rotations so you would have a much easier time in reckoning.
