guess we're not talking about dawnblade huh?
---
---
---
as someone who has used truth just to see.. yeah, if you need to use this weapon and if you run outta ammo and cant use the other weapons, dont bother invading, or get good at pvp before you do lol.
---

---
i use last word, it works very well.
---
In the videos they shows they were around 800 or so, so it's possible
---
Overall great watch, after what happened to Hughie in the first episode I knew it was for me.
---
I believe they said that no, you won‚Äôt be able to pull out armor 2.0 pieces from the collections tab
---
I just invade with a last perdition. No problems.
---
1. It's ether
---
2. If you have to say 'no offense', it's offensive.
---
Yup. That's me... üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
Should be in two weeks time.
---
They are also launching a fourth Iron banner due to the Shadowkeep delay
---
Did you solo que into comp or did you have a team?
---
just another generic "oem bad give likes" post, nothing to see here
---
One friend. Rest were randoms.
---
Xur only drops exotics up to Season 4. Anything post forsaken does not drop from him.
---
With Forsaken they added titles that appear under someone's name to show they've completed several associated tasks/collected certain gear.
---
Dredgen is the title that relates to Gambit. It has a whole convoluted lore reason and if you're interested in that I could point you in the right direction as well.
---
As you compete in Gambit you rank up and that score is called Infamy. Quickplay Crucible has Valor, and the Competitive playlist has Glory.
---
At certain thresholds of each you'll get rewards to drop as you increase ranks. Between 12,000-15,000 Infamy losses do not add anything and when you hit max Infamy (15,000) you can reset your score, which gives you more gear.
---
Reset Infamy once for the curated Trust hand cannon, twice for the curated Bad Omens rocket launcher, three times for the Furtive Shell ghost shell, three times *in one season* for the Ludomaniacal emblem.
---
Yes! Ah I love the story of Rabanastre. Shame to hear it's "lost" in the far future ;)
---
If you get the chance to pick up XII sometime please do, it has an incredible story in my opinion, if you can stomach the "main" character that you play as not actually being the character the story revolves around. I enjoyed the perspective, but many still criticize the game for that choice. 
---
Your character was just a commoner - it's your party members that are the royalty, the adventurers, the gifted and the fallen, etc. Super interesting. It's my favorite final fantasy game!
---
Three resets ever for the shell, three resets *in one season* for an emblem.
---
I usually use Revoker or any sniper tbh
---
Golgoroth challenge was probably my favorite encounter in either destiny
---
Advanced brush?? I struggle with standard!
---
¬£12, I think.
---
At least a month from now but they haven't explicitly given a season end date since announcing they were pushing Shadowkeep back to October.
---
Considering you don't have access to DLC quests for DLC you don't own on the platform, I would guess it would just put you in the nearest open world location outside of the quest. You could then resume the quest when you were on the platform you own the DLC on.
---
I'm going to stop you right there...
---
I mainly jotunn within pve or when my team is invaded. I stick to my hammer head if I invade more reliable.
---
Yeah good point I use Tazara Stare since it's a fun gun to use for invading and killing invader
---
Bungie can finally made the game the way they want to now is what Bungie had to say about the split essentially
---
21 of august , as they said ib their website
---
Yeah definitely gonna have to pick some up this weekend, thanks for the reply
---
Yup, right now I can have enhanced momentum transfer, heavy ammo finder, super mod, and hive armaments (which will probs be good for the hive dungeon, etc.), Whereas with 2.0 I cant have even half that. I like that the mods are infinite use, but that doesnt make up for losing mods and perks. Honestly not happy. The increased mob/res/rec and return of int/dis/str better be extremely good or this is just a straight up nerf in almost every way
---
No.
---
Well even if it was fixed, the activation rate is so slow the user still dies to the super 9/10.
---
What helmet is that Hunter on the left in the Mercury armor wearing?
---
Yeah definitely gonna have to pick some up this weekend, and that's good to know the 3m hooks will work cause I'm in an apartment as well. Thanks for the reply
---
What is it the slow charge time, slowish projectile that has lackluster tracking, it needing to hit the guardian in order to 1shot, or it‚Äôs general issues in being a good but not amazing fusion rifle.
---
Slow?! Wow I'm just unlucky
---
1 old = 10 new
---
according to the recent 'state of the game part 2' everything you own is going to be boosted to 750. I am pretty sure this is for all characters.
---
Unfortunately you do need 3 resets for the ghost, but I believe it‚Äôs total resets and not all in one season
---
I wish. Unfortunately we only had enough made for us.
---
I adore my tatara gaze and got a double headshot collateral kill on an invade with it.
---
LOL It's a "gild-tch" in the matrix.
---
Happened to my I kid you not
---
I just played a gambit match for the first time after getting my outbreak and I got the medal for ‚Äúkilling 4 players in an invasion without using heavy or super‚Äù with it. I was pretty proud of myself, since I‚Äôm not the best player
---
Oh, nice!! I scored a nice headshot on a Hunter that was using Spectrals once oh so satisfying
---
Yeah it was awefull please don't ask them to bring it back.
---
They don't announce DLC that far in advance, so we don't know what is coming after the smaller season DLCs after Shadowkeep (the pass). From the Shadowkeep reveal livestream, it did not sound like they were planning on stopping any time soon. 
---
I know people say D3 is on the horizon, but you have to keep in mind, nothing at all about D3 was ever formally announced, people just kept speculating it was going to exist "soon." But I don't think it's soon at all. I think they're going to keep adding to D2.
---
Exactly, didn't think I had to say it. Cheers
---
Well the 1 massive bolt can actually be tracked but it‚Äôs really hard to do so but it‚Äôs a slower bolt than every other fusion in the game. It take like 7-15 frames to go across the emerald coastline gambit arena.
---
Oil and Spark!!! LMAO
---
yup, thats what the picture seems to show.
---
No prob. If it helps here is the style 
---
[hook](https://www.brisbanetoolandhardware.com.au/images/123780l.jpg) I used. 
---
Good luck and keep your head up out there guardian ;)
---
My load times on this game are ridiculous. We have 300mbps internet and revert other game is fine but Destiny is extremely slow with starting, finding and loading matches, just going to the tower and getting stuck loading while running around in the same spots sucks too
---
This has to be some legal issues with activision that forsaken is not included. 
---
Makes no sense for it to not be included. 
---
Destiny usually releases the new expansion for 60 to include everything before.
---
Hey do you play on console or pc?
---
I'd keep it
---
I always used it in enclosed areas and I must be really unlucky lol
---
I think I'll just spend the 40 on forsaken to support bungie. Beside nintendo, bungie is a favorite of mine.
---
Well, yeah
---
1. You would be missing the campaign, side quests, farmable guns, and raids added by Forsaken and the annual pass. I don't have time right now to list off every single item, but it is WAY more than "some strikes" and "a couple" of exotic weapons. I do have [a list of all exotics and what DLC you need in order to get them!](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cdmiiw/up_to_date_list_of_how_to_get_exotics_and_which/)
---
2. Is this about Trials? Trials were removed from Destiny 2 due to very bad player feedback, and you didn't go to the lighthouse at the end like you did in Destiny 1. They don't plan on reintroducing Trials any time soon. The lighthouse you went to in Destiny 1 is now an open world location all people who own Destiny 2 can get to.
---
Im on board.

True Dreaming City ending time

During the stream when they showed of transmog you could see the green and blue set so it's technically an ornament

alright, alright, alright ~ x 3000

I'll never understand why people complain about morale patches. If it has nothing unprofessional just let it be and don't be a blue falcon

As far as I can tell, mercy rule doesn‚Äôt activate in comp.
---
dismantle all eververse armor, any sparrows you dont / wont use anytime soon, any ships you will not use, shaders.   Get that bright dust while you can.
---
Now this, this is good
---
Good to know that abandoning this game just after masterworks launched until they fixed random rolls/armor mods/replay value was the right move.
---
anyone have a high res of the image, want to make it my wallpaper
---
Call your doctor
---
Even Blink? I tried it while leveling and it seemed like it made any verticality or platforming difficult at best.
---
Ah, but THIS one has flappy cape! XD
---
I want to go into crucible with six void Titans, three with St 14 and 3 with Ursa. I wanna see bubbles, barricades and shields all thrown up around a single control point. Useful? No. Do I care? Also no.
---
Welcome to destiny, it‚Äôs been this for 5 years
---
Queue the people that are like "menagerie is perfectly fine. Its the best farm we have still"

I saw a post on the Xbox one LFG that was looking for people to throw gambit matches because it's faster. Scum.

It has the highest defense just in case
---
Fashion over function, boys. It ain't called Dresstiny for nothin.
---
You're missing an exotic /s

been stuck in the never ending suffering of brave 3 and brave 2, never have even been in heroic in comp before so this is all just really taxing

Not complaining about the painting but wouldnt that ace have leas range than a real sized one?

Oh then that‚Äôs pretty strange.

Where were you deployed?

Also dont judge im younger lol
---
Does this apply to all of those John Wicks in Fortnite?
---
But we all remember.
---
Here I am, months after BA released, still grinding for my god roll hammerhead...
---
Alexa, play chop suey.
---
my question aswell
---
And how he's going to pay us after each game but even till now still not a sliver of glimmer in sight....
---
I‚Äôm just saying, D3 probably won‚Äôt be a thing, with new light it seems that most if not all of D3 is being put into D2, just for new gen consoles, if there is a D3 then how will they explain us losing our gear again if they go with that?
---
Update: Turns out going hardcore into the basic strikes got me enough purples that the RNG decided to give me an honest-to-goodness exotic engram all on its lonesome.  So yeah, I have Sturm now.
---
Nice work! Got mine last week and man that was a mission. I‚Äôm average at PVP but the fact your glory is easily swayed by your team as a whole is pretty painful. 
---
Fantastic gun though. Definitely worth it
---
Worth for sure
---
Came here for this comment
---
I neva' freeze
---
I thought the Spider helped Mara hide him.
---
I remember visiting the spider and he said something like, ‚ÄúAs entertaining as it was to see the dead prince again, he deserves a nice long rest.‚Äù
---
Which took the longest? And how many hours have you got playing D2?
---
There is no point to power at the moment. When shadow keep was first announced I was leveling a titan and stopped because I knew I could get a 750. (I was later convinced to still do so for seeds of light and exotics) but if you aren't 750 yet there's no need to care about hitting 750 
---
Should you be angry about this? No. Every expansion of our light level has come with a easy way to catch up. And if you are angry about the precedent this sets, they clearly said that it is to restart and change how the light level balance is going to be moving forward, and would only happen like this if they feel they need to do another large change.
---
Oh oh I could play with you I'm the besticles, at least that's what my mom told me.
---
I think they killed him off to show how despite how great and powerful you think Guardians are they still can take on literally impossible odds alone. Had Cayde waited for back up Uldren would‚Äôve gotten away sure but we would eventually hunt him down probably even faster.
---
I got 25 invading kills with truth and truth alone. I am aware of the garbage i am. Forgive me.
---
i wish that was a real exotic. maybe then id have a chamce in crucible.
---
Yeah seems to be the most common one. Which is the next one to go for do you think? Obviously not the PVP one haha
---
No, you killed him, but the Cabal are so efficient they found another Bracus Zahn before you got to the top.
---
Oh yes you can.

Dr. Dre?

Leveling is useless now alongside old armour. After the campaign try to complete any unfinished quests, clear your pursuits via Completion. While or after that, gather resources. L shards, E cores, and gs mats. They'll all come in handy with shadowkeep. There are many ways to get all 3. The most efficient at the moment is afk forges.
---
Unlock any forge, buy green armour from hawthorn to lvl down, then hop into a forge and wait. The activity will fail before you time out, you will receive about 2 to 4 planetary mats for it, and then you'll be auto queued back into another game. It goes for as long as you want (though I've had some issues staying in the game.) and when your done, you'll have a butt ton of mats in ur postmaster. Aquire these, then go to the respective planet vendor and click away. You'll get a bunch of legendary gear, some of which will be masterworked. Dismantling these gives L shards, gs mats, and masterworked pieces give E cores.
---
New mats are coming with shadowkeep so if your topped up on old ones, you'll be able to grind for the new ones a bit easier.
---
&gt; the vanguard originally consisted of one of each race
---
While that was obviously on purpose, in-universe it's just pure coincidence.
---
You are an idiot smh
---
Also death walruses.
---
Think we're gonna catch him on the moon first
---
Shotguns were pretty rare for most of the campaign. Perhaps chances were lowered cus theyd have too high boss dps. I'm sure you'll easily get one after though.
---
Did Bungie bring back this map from D1?
---
Man, I'm trying to get the Dreaming City seal physically, but I need The Corrupted nightfall weapon...hope its next week :/
---
Damn I‚Äôve been seeing that you can get the quest again
---
He's still alive
---
in our hearts
---
Ummm ok I guess jokes are not allowed on this sub anymore.
---
They reintroduced the quest during the arc event, but removed it when the event ended.
---
F\*CK Uldren...
---
Exotic engrams are random drops from enemies, doing random gear drop activities like raids, crucible,strikes, nightfalls, etc. you can‚Äôt really ‚Äúfarm‚Äù exotics they just pop up randomly from playing the game.
---
Given i got only 2 of those in 3 infamy resets, i wouldn't count on that.
---
For the xur fated engram you have to talk to xur and he shows up every weekend,friday through Tuesday, and he sells a fated engram you can buy for 97 legendary shards and it gives you an exotic you don‚Äôt have yet
---
We need a 4k wallpaper of this!
---
True, who can blame Ikore as well.  
---
As a Hunter main, we don't need a Vanguard :D
---
Just started playing my Titan again since warmind.  I forgot how much fun it was to ape into a huge crowd of adds and just punch/heal my way out.  One eyed mask is just a bonus getting an over shield half the time.
---
It's extremely difficult to complete on console. That's why it's such an awesome achievement. Not many people have soloed it on console. My friend is world 6th. He knows the leaderboards so I just came in 7th.
---
Army or Air Force? Judging by the OCPs. 
---
Furthermore. I'm going to make that patch.
---
Damn, that Crevice Nozzle looks interesting!
---
Yeah I do frequently play pvp and in many lobbies I still see the same weapons over and over again such as recluse, ward cliff, luna, NF, LoW, erentil, last word, etc. Not blaming the players for using some of the best weapons in the game though. Especially upper levels of comp, the diversity really drops...
---
&amp;#x200B;

And I was snooping around reddit and found a great post by razobak09 I can agree a lot to.

---
What about world's first, should it count if you're using weapons that wouldn't have been aquired through normal means?
---
not really tbh
---
The issue is alot of quests etc require guardian kills in gambit and only 1 can invade, I find this one of the most frustrating experiences. Not the game modes fault, everyone invading would be chaos, quests should provide the option of gambit or crucible like for the first stage of the Solstice gear. Only way to avoid this experience is to get in a team as the dedicated invader, alot of competition for that spot though.
---
This is part of the annual pass - you need Forsaken + Annual Pass to access this content.
---
Lol. It feels so cheese when I'm 2 miles ahead of my team in murcury strikes cus I just run past the forest with stompies but it's so fun cus I get all the kills at the end XD
---
2 miles is 3.22 km
---
You don‚Äôt need the annual pas just foresaken
---
Rather than insult me, you could have actually answered the question, jackass.
---
You just need foresaken to get the quest. Without dlc your highest power level is only 380. With dlc it‚Äôs 750
---
yeah, its a challenge getting kills with close-range weapons lol. the most fun &amp; challenging weapons I've used to invade with was smugglers word sidearm &amp; quickfang sword. it's easy if I can get the drop on them or fool them with a smoke bomb.
---
is Elon Musk a Redditor?
---
Hmm. If you ditch the xbox acc you could just play on pc and still have a spare acc. But if you transfer ur xbox account to pc I believe you can play your pc expansions on the xbox acc.
---
My Tatara Gaze 1taps supers as well.   
---
Any sniper rifle 1taps with a crit. In Gambit I use Blast Furnace and Tatara Gaze for invasion and protection vs other invaders. I do not take heavies, I do not need them, so I am carrying tractor cannon for boss damage phase and versus enemy supers. Nothing feels better than shutting down titan's Thundercrash with a well-timed tractor shot.  
---
Using exotic slot and 3-4 bullets instead of learning to make crits is not a proper way to snipe. Works for you? That's great. All I am saying is that it is a waste of potential. You can do much better.
---
You'll be boosted to 750 at shadowkeep launch, but to actually play shadowkeep you need to buy the stuff. The annual pass gives you access to future content coming out after shadowkeep. I believe you will still be able to reach 1k power.
---
I don't know any way to remove it. I'm sure you've checked all the graphics settings. If you don't think you can see, try maxing your fov from 85 to 105 degrees.
---
Give me the DX chop!!! You've started something that I didn't realise I needed until now xD
---
Nope.
---
I didn't say anything about "no matter what", those are your words.
---
By abusing broken items and abilities, you increase your chances in any given engagement, but you don't win them all. Also there is a gap between an item like stompees, that is clearly good, but still requires you to play well -- and the roaming supers with regen-on-kill, etc.
---
All I'm saying is that I personally don't get any gratification from winning engagements using a double sized tennis racket. I also have a bit of a struggle seeing how others would find that particularily fun in the long run.
---
Celestial Nighthawk in the front... I like it
---
Did that, I don't actually think it does much to first person mode. You only really notice it when you're carrying a sword, orb or riding a vehicle.
---
Who needs a massive buff to thundercrash when you can have infinite dive bomb melee with an insurmountable skullfort?
---
Boi u got some nerve comin here
---
You need the annual pass for the invitation quest bud.
---
No. It won't. Year 1 will. Stop spreading lies.
---
I don't think anybody (beyond bungie) knows.
---
I liked Dreaming City, Forge, Solstice, and Gambit because they have a bunch of bounties that can be done in the same activity.
---
Ohhh I never really looked at it that way
---
can confirm
---
Where's buff Smurf?
---
Enough fooling around!
---
Oh. I've done like one game of Reckoning ever. I only just recently started playing again.
---
What if it already did?
---
And then we use sparrows
---
had one of 9 to 100 last night, we were literally being spawned camped. 
---
i died 3x before i took a step
---
why are snipers/shotguns not consider heavy ammo for pvp, gun play was 100x better season 1 (in pvp at least)
---
Wait until you get a trust with Rampage and Dragonfly, slap a dragonfly spec in it. The explosions do bonus damage from rampage then proc it.
---
Did you report them for afking?
---
Does anyone have a wallpaper version of this?
---
Moons haunted
---
You got bots. Please report those players.
---
The boost is happening so new players start on an even playing field with existing players. Bungie doesn't want new players to have to grind tens of hours of old content before they can play Shadowkeep. All of Y1 and Y2 is being reclassified as optional content.
---
I save my super for just the right "witness me" moment. 
---
I've been gone for a year. I'm so bad.
---
Good feels but my controller needs to be in my hands
---
Impressive.  I only finished my first set (Hunter) 2 days ago.  Even then, I only masterworked 2 pieces.
---
Do anyone know if buying the glow sets for one class will transfer to the other two ?   Dropping 15k bright dust on my Hunter was painful enough.  No way I'm paying 30k more for the other two.
---
Thank you! Really appreciate it, Guardian.
---
And I give a fuck about neither
---
The honesty is real though. We all have bad moments. It‚Äôs why I love this game.
---
Hence the ‚Äúwill eventually become a guaranteed drop‚Äù because no matter how you see it adding a percentage to the original drop rate again and again will eventually make it become 100% and don‚Äôt say 100% is impossible to reach cause anything is possible amongst so many guardians. thus no longer being RNG because guaranteed means you‚Äôre just gonna get it no matter what the outcome is.
---
I will
---
you in the wrong neighborhood fool
---
Well....then make your own.
---
Idk but I'm scared...
---
First rule if Destiny club, we don't talk about Destiny club.
---
Hey that's pretty good
---
Happened to me as well a while ago and I can confirm vuvuzela will drop them for you now. Happy farming.
---
There‚Äôs literally less fun in that sometimes. Did you play a lot of Halo CE- Reach? I did. Sometimes dying was at the core of what we were trying to do.
---
Try closing the blizzard launcher completely after launch and see if that helps
---
Service revolver primarily drops from grandpa smurf, but as you've proven it can drop from hawthorne. Maybe other vendor drops can drop from hawthorne too? Wing contender kinda stuff.
---
No. Those were part of the screenshot...
---
Might be something dumb and obvious but I fall into that category a lot so who knows... Have you checked this over a period of time? could be that there are things running in the background, I find my PC doing updates at the weirdest times, usually like to keep my Resource manager open to make sure, some services like the svchost (updates) can have a massive pull on a line.

Lol, blasting rage while standing next to the space fascist himself.

Looks like they snuck in a new exotic.

1% primeval damage?! Slacker. /s

Controllers on PC function the same as consoles.

September 2014

Time for the NF grind. Goodluck

&lt;3
---
Its not less fun unless you like taking longer at a objective
---
Because thats how games work. Progress over time like every over mmo or loot shooter
---
Pfft, invaders with truth will never reach the truth
---
üëåüèª You do, what you gotta do.
---
I can‚Äôt tell if this is some meta joke I‚Äôm not getting lmao
---
Source? I can‚Äôt find where it‚Äôs been stated that Majestic Solstice gear can be ornaments
---
I just got Truth, and I will absolutely invade with it...
---
... and be killed by someone with a hammerhead before I get my first round off...
---
Thank you, I‚Äôm excited lol
---
Thank you for the compliment, Guardian!
---
Twice
---
Actually, getting Skolas to stay nearby was never an issue. For me it was just time, I could never find people that had 4 hours to burn at the same time as me. So most of the time we'd go through the PoE part, get to Skolas, wipe 2-3 times and then lose a person.
---
Agreed
---
So eververse armor is going to stop dismantling for dust (so dust it all now) but is that true of all eververse cosmetics? Sparrows/ships/shells/shaders?
---
They didn't like all the r34 *or maybe there was just too much*
---
Inferior platform.
---
That‚Äôs amazing!
---
Yup it‚Äôs posted there :D
---
Hehehehe not this time
---
Weirdly I would like to enjoy the ride somewhat. I‚Äôm not horrible but always struggle in comp. I think I have like a 1.6 combat efficiency. I have no idea what my actual kd is. 
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 btw
---
I would also not trust anyone to have access to my account ha.
---
It‚Äôs so much slower.  Faster infamy in prime and more bounties
---
So you're just going to add to the toxicity of the game mode instead of actually playing to win? K.
---
All of the lowest items at 750 power won‚Äôt make sense for new players. 750 power will now be the equivalent of 10 power. Why not just drop everything to 10 power and activities lower so we don‚Äôt start the climb again from an unreasonably high number? Why not just start it again from low?
---
Does a little bit, doesn‚Äôt it? There‚Äôs been a few DS influences through the years though, so I‚Äôm not too surprised. I think they nailed the look on everything forsaken with some sick spaces.
---
Short answer : yes
---
1.6 efficiency is plenty to get to fabled. you just need a team. I only have a 1.4 and I make it to fabled every season.
---
Why would you give up the precision of kb&amp;m?
---
Use light.gg
---
Planetary, spider, and Ada.
---
It‚Äôs so everyone new can actually play the first two years of content without leveling for 100 hours first.    That‚Äôs the difference.  
---
If they set everyone to 0, no one could play any of the activities.   It‚Äôs easier to set 750 as baseline and open all the stuff than to recode all the level and power requirements for every single aftivity
---
This is what made me dismantle the invader gear....it was as if they couldn't see me literally putting on invader ready gear. Camping heavy and the portal.
---
Thank you! I‚Äôm going to try to recreate it when cross save launches on my PC.
---
At least I‚Äôll be able to play...ü§£

Its views like this that makes me hope they'll expand onto current planets/zones. For example, going to other ruined cities around Earth. Also, fun fact: during the DC intro mission, if you continue talking to Petra she'll mention that the Awoken had several cities like the DC, each with it's own purpose, including a place where they solely make weapons. Thatd be a cool place to check out imo.
---
I'm finishing my third and can say I probably won't be playing again until october.
---
No need to be a dick üòë

Light is an entirely arbitrary mechanic in the current state of the game. Through the entirety of D2 it has served as nothing more than a time gate on content. Nothing is being "handed" to new players because Light doesn't have any actual value as things stand. Maybe that will change with Shadowkeep, but I see no point in gatekeeping 750 Light as some kind of meaningful achievement.
---
There is a ton of space for sure. I‚Äôm hoping now without restrictive time constraints we will see much more of these new spaces.

Then do to those new players what they did *LITERALLY* *one* *season* *ago*, give em a short grind in form of a quest with 750 power gear,it worked and everyone was happy with it. Whatever this is, im willing to bet its not for what they say it is for
---
That's the best thing there going to be 2.0 armor so they'll actually be usefull for a bit
---
The more Calus gear you have equipped, the faster you progress
---
I had heard of you have the annual pass and forsaken, then in f2p model you get some annual pass for free? Is this true?
---
Sooo...what makes it different from other titan plays? OEM, Ace of Spades, shotgun, and a LOT of punching, just what titans were made for and what they are hated for.
---
# Nice
---
I hate hearing that
---
imo i thought the explanation of the reapers was fine. they wanted to preserve the cycle of life and keep it going so one species doesn't oppress the other cause they're too powerful. I'm not sure what else they could've done for the origin but if you got any ideas I'm open to hearing em.
---
Is that a long grind? Is 650 the soft cap right now?
---
It's really awkward to see post about OEM titan with Ace and Shotgun being upvoted and in hot today.  
---
It seems all haters were punched irl!
---
You make a fair point to be honest.
---
Nevertheless I'm gonna reserve judgement. But I sure don't blame you for having the opinion you have.
---
Do I not understand the power reset? Games like PoE reset per season to flush the player economy, but it means slogging through the story of the game every time. I eventually quit because I have limited time and replaying the same story over and over just sucked. So we reset power, where does that leave my hunter? Game starts over again every 3 months? I haven‚Äôt had the time to watch the stream, so I could very well be missing something.
---
Truth.
---
Although I would have chosen a different anime character to represent that. This guy? looks homo AF.
---
You're a good guardian :)
---
My guardian too üò¢
---
Like Hemplev said, use the built-in LFG tool. Every xbox player I know uses that above other methods, so your way more likely to find someone on there. It's intuitively designed, quick and easy to use.
---
Hit guide &gt; tab left twice to reach the parties tab &gt; go down and select "Looking For Group" &gt; Select "Destiny 2" (or whatever game you're playing) &gt; browse posts, use the search/filters, create your own post &gt; PROFIT!
---
I will never reach the truth (i cant get people to dl nightfalls with me)
---
Then getting depressed thinking there is a prime on the ground but it‚Äôs actually heavy
---
Well *Uldren* is dead, so you can put that bag of dicks away.
---
It does but I realized it doesn't help with upping your orb count when going for 1500 :/
---
Didn't see it posted yet, so here it is for everyone else like my that likes his infographs.
---
DISGUSTING.
---
  
---
I love it.
---
Nice
---
Ohh okay, I understand what you meant now. I just assumed it could have been a PC because they‚Äôre using a special test build. It seems more likely they would test on the PC version first as it seems the developers themselves personally play the PC version.

Yea I‚Äôm trying to farm Spare Rations this week tho. And the Solstice armor just brought me to 681, I‚Äôll just do some powerful drops and I should be good. Thanks.
---
But he couldn‚Äôt walk tho
---
I feel your concern but honestly you and everyone else just needs to relax. There is limited information available right now and this is a new system. There will 100% be value adjustments in future patches. Is the system perfect, no, does it have endless customization compared to the system we have now, yes. Give it some time before you start pointing out flaws in a system that hasn‚Äôt even released yet. If you set your expectations so high, everything will fail them. Go in with an open mind set and realize it‚Äôs a work in progress.
---
I just use jade rabbit or Polaris lance when invading.lol works great actually
---
You touch pulled pork and you'll wish you could die
---
It isnt reworking, more a matter of placing down an area for raid banners to be placed down
---
You got my upvote!  üòî
---
Well said üëçüèº
---
1%
---
Same happened to me but im a worlock main yeah
---
Yes and the sleeper stimulant also reached gjallahorn levels back then
---
On the Xbox store the sale ends in 17 days, so it must the same in all other platforms.
---
Spoopy lore?
---
Of course! Lol
---
Hence why I said normally. My average is about 40-50% boss damage
---
Has some odd side effects though. Wouldn't recommend
---
It's not just a Gambit thing.  The problem, at least in my opinion is quests and bounties.
---
Any Quest step or bounty that has a step which makes you play any version of gambit or crucible that required you to just play X matches encourages lazy players to just afk-macro to completion. 
---
 A simple fix would have all quest steps/bounties require you also win the match for any of your progress to count.   
---
Admittedly the requirements should change to reflect this condition so that the amount of grind would be roughly the same. 
---
 If winning is part of the quest/bounty condition it would mean everyone in the match would have the same ultimate goal regardless if what they were working on.
---
Yes
---
Finally got on a. Winning team yesterday felt good because it's always me getting owned. I finally figured I need to bring the Nade launcher in to warp thingy! I'm still power lvl 300 so i dont have the op guns everyone else has.
---
Well bubble buff in d1 only had that extra 10% with the one perk applied. I don‚Äôt remember what it was called though, but I‚Äôm super happy that it‚Äôs not 25%
---
Gunsmith mats definitely only drop guns.
---
I think I heard that you have to keep the root account up but it's hard to delete an account anyway.
---
This is nonsense. I don‚Äôt see the problem with hand cannon quests. If you don‚Äôt like the hand cannons, don‚Äôt get them. But I bet you will or already have.
---
BOMMMMBBBTRACK
---
Fvck trials.  That is all.
---
Obviously you‚Äôre talking to a troglodyte. Don‚Äôt worry about him.
---
Was just thinking this
---
You're not alone, guardian.
---
Well, except when you're on the point that's already been captured.
---
But, I do this too.
---
Does the cross save FAQ stickied to the front page of this subreddit help at all? 
---
There is no way to merge accounts from different platforms, so you couldn't combine your PS4 and PC accounts, but bungie has been very clear on their website from day 1 that all progress and purchases from battle net will transfer to steam.
---
I call Bs
---
Does it require you to match the element of the day?
---
On what?
---
Fated engrams
---
Lol.  Last week it gave me the same exotic that was on sale for 70 less shards.
---
yep I noticed that. these sneaky weasels are gonna change the name of it and bring that hoe back in the game later on I bet.
---
I don't think you'd hit fabled even if you started week 1 of the new season and lost 2, won 1 for the whole season.
---
I'm down idk what leviathan is this lmao what's your Gt I'm on Xbox
---
There's not enough time in Opulence.
---
If you're on PC I'd be down to play, i know all to well how mental health issues can effect a person on a daily basis.
---
Yeah, I had my cursor on the one I had already acquired a few weeks ago. Truly lame. Lol
---
Its just tedious as fuck, it feels kinda lazy.
---
Bungie could've tied the loot to the EAZ instead of doing 25 patrols on some fuck off planet dig?
---
This can't be a real post right? You act like the grind to 750 was hard. Why would bungie make these people get stuck at the soft cap and grind their way up to the new one. They'd be stuck at soft cap for so long. Also, a petition? Really dude? You're THAT petty that you made a petition?
---
[Long answer for how the fated engram works at the start of this post I made.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cdmiiw/up_to_date_list_of_how_to_get_exotics_and_which/)
---
Short answer: Xur's engram doesn't give duplicates until you have exhausted its loot pool. It cannot give every exotic.
---
I'm sorry. I always buy any exotics I don't have prior to buying the fated first.
---
That's why you buy the exotics you don't have beforehand ;)
---
Because of the wording. I also hope he becomes a true Eliksni guardian.
---
Hits well sword...
---
WHAT.  
---
Oh, come on. I'm just missing Braytech Osprey and a couple EP armor pieces.  
---
That's all i've been missing for like 6 months but i was busy every time Strange Terrain was the nightfall and didn't have any luck dropping it before that.  
---
That's BS. I'm a solo player and its practically the only one with Cursebreaker you can get without raiding or grinding your ass off in PvP, but i won't get it because of RNGs.
---
just wait for iron banner week u get like 3x the valor points its super easy
---
I have been really struggling as well.
---
What they said.  It‚Äôs literally the easiest masterwork option.
---
2. 
---
Sure? 
---
Whatever you want?
---
It's super worth it, it's a steep price for the one I got but its been an absolute blast having reduced load times
---
Bruh I grinded touch of malice for so long lmao
---
All the armors are extremely underrated.
---
Right? I don't even want stronghold, but it makes me happy to see.
---
Friends?
---
U get points just for participation
---
 you dont even have to win.
---
You mean like asking a pvp player 
---
to solo shattered throne?
---
Quit whining whole quest is pve with one pvp part per set.
---
No problem man, hey also once you complete it and turn it in, you can get it again. Very helpful for ‚Äúcomplete x amount of bounties.‚Äù
---
Nice.
---
I thought T3 had better drop rates
---
I‚Äôm looking for Ray Finkle..
---
And a clean pair of underwear
---
That's not code right there my dude. Tic rate slow af.

F.
