The fact that he bagged right after he did it was even more degrading lmao ü§£üòÇü§£

On console it's stompees, dust rock, recluse and wardcliff.

And here I am feeling anxious because I haven't even started the pursuit.
---
yuuuup. I got mine and i have 75 kills with it. Theres just so many better options. If they brought it back up to 180 it would dominate.
---
RTL
---
Nice!!! Congrats!
---
Nah I got myself into that one.  Idk I‚Äôm not trying to say ‚ÄúI could go pro if only I used DRB‚Äù or anything, but I also can‚Äôt ignore how much better I do with meta weapons equipped.  At the end of the day it‚Äôs just a game and if I don‚Äôt care about winning then I shouldn‚Äôt care about losing either.  I just think people like that other dude saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôd suck with or without meta weapons,‚Äù aren‚Äôt nearly good enough themselves to be saying that.
---
I was waiting for a blade barrage
---
Not what I meant. Your Warlock using Well of Radiance should be free to use any exotic (preferably Lunafactions) as long as your hunter is using tether frequently.
---
Having the ability to track through walls is a godsend to me.  I find the way people treat cornering to be pretty predictable as it is, so having the ability to then also track them just feels dirty.
---
I let him know that the reddit community is here for him. Please go show him a tremendous amount of support. I couldn‚Äôt imagine what he‚Äôs going through
---
Neither can I, must've destroyed the poor guy, I've suffered loss myself but not to that extent wife-wise and having that extreme bond as well, damn
---
yea, the fact that he put it as his wife/best friend killed me. I truly feel bad for him and I hope he gets through this
---
Yeah I know. I just think it would be nice is all.
---
Uuuuuuhhhhh.....

I get the sentiment. I really do. I already utilize this system by playing rumble when I don't want to be hindered by "them!"

I just wouldn't get your hopes up for better QoL. I guarantee it's going to be a stomping ground for good pvp players grinding their pursuits lol.

Please refer to the link I commented, this isn‚Äôt my Twitter post I just wanted to share it with the community, but thank you nonetheless

I know man, just for the cause
---
That's what I did for a whole day but I was demoralized by the tiny amount of progress I made. After I heard about the change to the quest requirements I decided to wait it out, so soon I'm gonna have to buckle down again to do it for real.
---
Let me in on some of this my man. Where the goods at

Rather it was accidental or not is up to you, maybe it was a prop they just had laying around, but that is the Hunter Knife, compare that link to the above picture, its literally the exact same Knife.
---
During my time with that quest, I wanted to know what dev made it, and require them to sit down and actually complete that shit themselves lmfao.
---
It'll take a long time but I'm sure he'll be fine, I don't think theres truly getting over the loss like that though hope he's doing ok
---
I'm about to go through chemo for Hodgkin's Lymphoma in about 2 weeks. I wasn't really worried at all til I read this and remembered I'm gonna have a completely obliterated immune system while living with people who aren't at all concerned with keeping a clean living space. 
---
I've been told by all my doctors that hodgkin's lymphoma is the most researched form of cancer, and it has a very high cure rate, and since I'm young and healthy I should be completely fine, but all it takes is one person to not wash their hands while carrying the common cold during chemo and it's over for me.
---
Ahahaha.
---
Socially anxious person here. You do need a mic...but for callouts/raid specific stuff ONLY, if that's what you want. That means asking questions about your role in each encounter, letting the team know if enemies slipped by you if you're an adds clearer, and other stuff like that since they need areas clear to do what needs to be done, or they need to know if you messed up (we all do it, it's part of the learning process, and anyone that even scoffs at you, i wouldn't deal with...there are plenty of laid back raid groups that understand not everyone can understand everything their first time).
---
You don't need to feel obligated to talk...I rarely talk during 6 people raids because usually there's enough chatter going on that they don't need my input. It's actually kind of nice.
---
If I'm with just my 3 best friends raiding, I'm more chatty because I know them well enough, and the voice channel isn't cluttered with a ton of people talking over one another.
---
Some raid groups will let you join VC with no mic if you choose, but I can see multiple ways on how that can go awry.
---
Overall, it's highly recommended, bordering needed since it makes finding out how to do the raid that much easier when everyone can voice their concerns or ask questions about what their role is in each encounter...as well as callouts. Voice chat is why stacks do so well in comp and Gambit, and it can make solo queuing feel like hell (can't tell you how many times I got pushed into the enemy's line of sight when trying to go for cover when solo queuing, today it happened 5 times...in 2 matches). So it only makes sense that it would make raids go much more smoothly.
---
I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that, suicide is truly a sad topic. I lost my uncle to suicide so I can somewhat understand what your going through but at the same time loosing a best friend is 100x worse. And you might be thinking about the memories screen where it showed your d1 experiences, it you want to access it again on the character select screen press square I believe. If that‚Äôs not it then I‚Äôm not sure what your talking about
---
Welcome, guardian! Don‚Äôt listen to your friends, they‚Äôll never know the joy of being a space wizard with a heavy machine gun.
---
Just start with the story missions, and work your way through the campaign. It‚Äôs a good story, and super fun to play though. Buy daily bounties from every planetary vendor, they‚Äôre a great way to get new gear and planetary materials. And do the most sectors!
---
Obviously not. I bet you have the most fun in mayhem

Working on my first 3d print right now as well, The First Curse way back from D1. I'm having the same problem of super defined layer lines, it took 27 hours to print the whole thing so just printing with smaller lines isn't a viable option

The best super in the game lol so much salt! I love it.

Pics or it didn't happen. He only drops guns.

At least it's not PC legend where everyone snipes. If you take a corner without 3rd person peeking it first they will take your face off every time. The games are soooo slow because everyone just holds lanes from the back of the map. Like handholding Mida meta except it only takes one legend player with Twilight Oath to dominate an entire lane by themself, freeing up their pals to go hold all the other lanes too.
---
Because they're a bit of light-hearted fun :) I don't NEED a sparrow that is so small that my Titan looks ridiculous driving it, but it puts a smile on my face every time I summon my sparrow :D Also the Clarion Horn was my favourite thing, I would pay irl money to get it back!

PC my friend had some cash on steam so i pre purchased the bundle as soon as i realize it was coming to it

Nice ty, i was wondering if there is something i need to know about what resources i should never spend early game or something like that i would regret later in game and wish i knew better to keep

Also a brand new armour system that will be heavily resource dependent, so definitely save those codes.

Completing all challenges (Petra, Nessos,  Werner chests, 5 crucibles, etc) is a good idea to get a lot of 750 items.

---
Why is this so true
---
Your opinion is respected by me, good sir. Totally agree that the community is too whiny and calls out other people for trying to play the game, and their complaints are uncstructive and will change nothing.
---
Still works, but the timing is tricky.
---
Got it on PS4 so I can co-op it with my girlfriend. The mission is to marathon BL3 nonstop until completion so I got all the time in the world to properly enjoy Shadowkeep :)
---
I have Shadowkeep preordered but I wish I had the money for BL3.
---
2 weeks is a ton of time to finish the story and grind for gear
---
I will never understand the vehement distaste for downloading another launcher to play a game
---
...nice
---
I won't call you salty, because of the level of self-awarness you have and the fact your arguments are definitely on point. It is rather ironic that crucible pinnacle weapons are so damn good in pve and it should be a clear sign for Bungie maybe work more on splitting those two categories for the future pinnacle rewards.  As for not liking pvp, it is a totally valid opinion. I for example don't like raids because I find them boring and repetitive and once you learn the mechanics, it is all the same over and over. Hopefully the upcoming changes in competitive structure and its solo mode will help you get those guns dude. Gonna wish you luck! =)
---
Very true, jumping high enough is a right bitch to try and hit, people out run me regular doing that, also you can be one shot out of it by any other super in the game, but attack someone who has popped super and your talking 2-3 shoulder bashes to kill them, super vs super striker will usually lose unless your quick.
---
have to disagree with point 4. I dont play titan, never really got on with or enjoyed the class but I like to complete stuff for IB. Bottom tree striker with OeM is so ridiculously easy that unless there was another titan on the team running the same build then I was top of my teams leader board nine times out of ten and I dont even play titan.
---
Sure! No shader, and it's called the Dulcinea shell. It was limited time in the dawning event I believe. Unfortunately cant get it anymore.
---
If you feel like an activity is not fun, but gives good rewards, dont play it. You can get away with a lot of stuff these days, you can run whatever you want in a raid and still be able to complete it with little to no effort. With that being said here are some stuff you might wanna get you hands on. Depending on how good you are in crucible, go for MT and recluse, not only are the weapons very powerful they trivialize the games difficulty, but they are also very fun to use. If you are an average player, but have teammates you trust, go for it, if you are a really good player but play solo, go for it, other wise wait for next season. Whisper of the worm seems like it's going to make a come back, so get that and finish the catalyst. The increased reload speed from lunafaction and really barricade also seems like it will make izanagi's burden a really good gun, so try to get your hands on it and get thr catalyst for that as well, as it makes the gun a beast. Other than that, just play to have fun, hopefully you'll get lucky with some exotics, and dont forget to pick exotics from xur and to get your fated engram
---
Thank you very much! Its a shame that we lose people to such circumstances and I am fortunate enough to still have my daughter. Just knowing that little things, like Destiny, can hold memories forever and that there is always light is what kept me positive. I empathize with this person knowing the battle that takes place but I could never know what it's like to lose to this. They are in my thoughts.

I just really don‚Äôt want to download the Epic launcher.

Honestly it‚Äôs a good thing. Meta‚Äôs been stagnant for so long now that I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôll see a change/
---
This is a fully masterworked weapon, not a curated role. And you get one from your first heroic menagerie clear for the week
---
Excellent work. But in game the weapon needs some rework or buff. I never see somebody using it.
---
This is great
---
Agreed. I‚Äôm tempted to now start running bottom tree Nughtslaker now instead of just being a celestial nighthawk bot in raids
---
Thank you, Dork. It is nice to have a civilized conversation about a bit controversial topic in destiny universe. It is just sad seeing such great community, as we saw recently with the Mars challenge, unwilling to treat this matter with less toxicity I encounter often.
---
Yeah one vanguard will be available, I'm assuming the old ornaments will work.

You know those little kids cart in super markets this is that. No matter the age you always like taking them even tho you can only fit 2 things in it.
---
Blast furnace with feeding frenzy kill clip is pretty fantastic, not great in very close quarters but you can make it work
---
The thing I need to remind myself is that -sometimes- you really do just get an unlucky game or streak. Playing well, hitting your shots, avoiding unfavorable engagements, but not playing well enough to hard carry your team. In the long run you'll win games for the same reason just as often. Randomness all equals out in the end.

You may also want to check your fireteam status on the roster.  If it is closed/private no one can join you.  The very first mission has to be done solo, the missions for new subclasses has to be done solo, and there are a few others, but not many.  Most can be done in a fireteam.

Issue ID: #68567285  
---
Your ticket has received the following response:
---
*Hey there \*\*\*\*\*. I'm Game Master Tyaeralcal. I completely understand wanting to know if you can claim a Destiny 2 key for the PC still!*  
---
 
---
*At the moment, the information that we have indicates that it is still possible to claim Destiny 2 keys. You should be able to claim them here:* [*https://battle.net/shop/checkout/key-claim*](https://battle.net/shop/checkout/key-claim)  
---
*If it doesn't work there, then it's not possible. You should be able to redeem them once it's on Steam in that case, though.*
---
So if you buy a key from somewhere it should work, but no guarantees.  If it does not work you will be able to use it on Steam when the game moves over Oct. 1.
---
Also, make sure you have set up your [bungie.net](https://bungie.net) account for the move.
---
Does kills in a private match go towards quests? Can I use this for chaperone?
---
See my comment on this thread.  You may be able to purchase and play on PC now.
---
Idk about others but I have a subtle calamity with Dragonfly and Explosive arrowhead and it works wonders on ad-clear.
---
don‚Äôt forget enemy spawns, cause fighting Saturn at level one is something
---
Problem is, you need another person around to use the noble round
---
You can get them in Gambit Prime, Reckoning, and doing Drifter Bounties (he has 4 dailies that the reward is each kind of synth.)
---
That exotic being?
---
Whining and complaining about people whining and complaining. Interesting.

Yep, and then getting a pistol that shoots liek a kerblaster with electric nukes as proyectiles

Okay let me rephrase myself, I have AP just got back into destiny a few weeks ago. Specifically I‚Äôm in a dire need for a kinetic pulse or hand cannon. I know today is spare rations day but all I use for pvp is last word. I‚Äôm in a dire need of a top tier pve gun

---
There‚Äôs worse things you can do haha, but it‚Äôs pretty annoying having an afk/boss phase blueberry, especially depending on the strike. Some strikes will pull everyone forward but a few won‚Äôt advance until all members reach a certain point (I‚Äôve had that happen in the Xol strike and Warden of Nothing), so you‚Äôre stuck until the person realizes and has to run through the whole thing to join you, or they get kicked. It‚Äôs even worse if your active blueberry doesn‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing or dies a lot, so then you‚Äôre basically soloing.
---
I get trying to be efficient with play time, and inventory management is not particularly fun. With friends it‚Äôs fine to let them carry you if they‚Äôre on board with it, but imo it‚Äôs just a bit rude with blueberries :)
---
I need to know as well.

At least 10x brighter and louder I reckon. I want to be blasted from my sofa.

I see a bit on Polygon about their strange review copy via handed out epic accounts.  I do hope they fix those issues with the day 1 patch.  We'll see I guess.  If not I suspect it will be far less buggy after a couple weeks.  Gearbox is known for tons of good updates.  I don't expect to be left in the dark with a broken game.  That said, really hopefully they do fix most of the issues before they piss off too many people.  They can't afford to mess up BL3.  
---
https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/9/9/20852642/borderlands-3-review-pc-ps4-xbox-one
---
"Gearbox may have fixed these problems by the time the game launches, and I hope it does. We‚Äôve been told the game is receiving a substantial day-one patch, but if you‚Äôre worried about the game‚Äôs stability, you may want to proceed with caution until we (and other publications and players) are able to test the launch version on PC. Reviewing Borderlands 3 was frustrating ‚Äî partly due to the often tedious nature of the game itself, and partly due to the fact that Gearbox was clearly still working on the game.'

God speed guardians, god speed.
---
Man of culture
---
There is a difference between a carry----you play with better players that help you win to get the glory-----and allowing someone else to play on your account to obtain the weapons.  If you played in every match and worked for the weapons then that is not cheating.....if it is then everyone who played in a fireteam of more than 2 people should have the weapon taken away.  
---
People LFG for a fireteam to WIN. Winning is how you obtain glory.  So if you happen to have friends that are good enough to carry you, or get someone else via LFG or Streamer to carry you, more power to you.  If you paid to get the weapons then that is different al together, and wrong on sooooo many levels.
---
Colony is best, just spam in the general direction of multiple players. What subclass are you? If you are a tether hunter, i recommend swapping to fighting lion when you have your super.
---
Good luck guardian!
---
I am glad that someone said it... now please nerf well and we are going in the right direction.
---
I love you flair btw
---
Essentially like the Warframe Dojo (clan space). Yes, do it.
---
What if you're a hunter (like your flair) and want to run the one two punch cross counter combo? Bop them with a blessing of the sky too!
---
But it doesnt matter that it is because bottom tree striker has the power of one but you can do it multiple times.
---
Invis hardly matters they are still very obvious it is better to be invincible and able to one shot anyone attacking from a distance
---
What? Shoulder charge cant be easily countered when it can be activated faster and further than any shotgun can kill it, shield bash and the solar one are just as op. 
---
Really? Better grenade charges for a single subclass is all you can come up with?

I remember dreaming of a game like Destiny when I played BL1. Now that BL3 is coming out I feel kind of meh about Borderlands. Gonna pick it up and play with some friends though. Definitely more pumped for SK.
---
10/10 wholesome
---
during gambit prime use your supers on groups of enemies and kill as much as you can during it try and let your teammates bank so you dont end up getting collector motes instead at the end you will get some motes based on what you did the most
---
I can feel that "bruh"
---
the range on it is pretty small and doing it negates the reason people are using it aka the long duration as you don't get back more than you used
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
depends on the map tbh i mean purple doesnt work well against glowing orange but you aren't seen on radar
---
btw heavy and abilities melt through the sentinel shields
---
not better grenade charges it's for pocket nova you know the actual best oneshot in the game with more range than any shotgun an exotic that gives it to you every time you use it and you get a defense buff makes it much better than one eyed as you can tank shotguns but they can;t tank your pocket nova
---
In my opinion, yes. I‚Äôm gonna pick it up later when it‚Äôs on sale, it has a great story (so I hear) and a lot of exotics I‚Äôd like access to. But I wanna run through that story personally. If it‚Äôs on sale for $15-20 I‚Äôm interested.
---
I have gotten old fashioned from buying the legendary engram from the cryptarchs
---
Everybody gangster until Savathun starts singing...
---
Way to finish in style.  I have the kills portion done I'm just struggling getting to Fabled.  :(
---
Dude this is the exact opposite of the point
---
Please remove this strike from the game
---
I wanted too but I don't have the space in my travel bag or the money really. Maybe someday.
---
This was me. But I‚Äôm approaching it as I can do whatever I want. Just want to have fun. It‚Äôs less anxiety because the game hasn‚Äôt ever really connected stories or expansions together by narrative, it‚Äôs almost like a book by the same author but not as a series. So no real harm missing out.
---
Thank you!
---
I guess I mean less of WHAT to do but more how much I have to do
---
No
---
Are you on Xbox? I can help you if you are :)

30 seconds in the crucible coulda told you that...
---
So?
---
Alrighty I'll probably do the same. Thanks a ton for your insight and help my friend!
---
I think I‚Äôll take it slow and finish all season of drifter stuff. Then opulence THEN get shadowkeep
---
Yep, no harm in doing that
---
Multiple pinnacle weapons, a new raid, gambit prime and reckoning, menagerie and chalice, multiple exotic quests,
---
i know thats my point . TONS of stuff haha
---
Saw it at Target for same price also, Amazon my friend.
---
That kind of thinking is fine, work with what the devs have out at the moment
---
It‚Äôs the whole ‚Äúthey must suffer‚Äù kind of thing that takes away from the community
---
Oh come on, it's just a joke.
---
I'll use "/s" next time
---
No worries, have a great one!
---
Huh. They had one at my Target for 29 bucks. 70 is a bit much definitely.
---
No, because either a mission or the strike simply covered that body with a rock.
---
I actually don‚Äôt know I have never played a warlock only titans/hunters. It‚Äôs void and I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs an ability or something.
---
This is fine 
---
But you aren‚Äôt fine to be there
---
Holy shit, this! Two of my clan mates were introducing me to Reckoning the other night after I'd unlocked it. In the space of one game, we had 4 different blueberries all drop in, sit for about 30 seconds, and then bounce out. The fifth blueberry actually stayed around with us for a while, but good hell. We weren't even failing or struggling when the four numpties decided to quit before they tried.

Not sure what they were looking for, other than maybe joining a group that was 97% finished and didn't want to help put in the effort to get the win.

I don‚Äôt get it

Patrols, HVT roaming bosses, and heroic PEs.  Patrols give 1 per completion, HVT's it is RNG you may not always get one, and PE give 1, 2 if heroic.  
---
Patrols are the quickest way.  Just do the HVTs and PEs if they are in the area.  I always do the scavenge and kill patrols first (triange &amp; dotted X).  The scan (ghost) and survey (clock) ones will always take you to another area.  The Assassinate (Circle w/star) ones will take you into a lost sector or to another area.  The patrols will repopulate as you complete them through a cycle of 2 complete sets (2 scavenge, 2 kill, 1 survey, 1 scan, and assassinate).  If you leave the area the cycle will reset.
---
So as long as you stay on the target during heroic, the timer will never stop so you should be able to do it solo that way. If I remember correctly that is

Microsoft  has their own console. Sony has their own console. Nintendo has their  own console. They also own the IPs they sell. (Doesn't mean I like that  they are exclusives, but the comparison is asinine.)
---
Completely  false equivalence between console exclusivity and the battle between  Steam and Epic. Steam and Epic are distributors only.
---
I  get a lesser service for the same amount (sometimes more) money. "It's  fine if I don't have access to forums, reviews, regional pricing,  workshop, gifting, cloud saves, achievements, third party keys, and a  bunch more. The devs get to make 5$ more per sale! Hell yea! What a deal  for me!"
---
The number of people who  use Epic are largely due to Fortnite and nothing else. But we'll never know, since only Steam has player count statistics.
---
And  don't you think the lovely devs could make even more money if they  released their game on Epic AND Steam? And no, the loss of Steam sales  won't overshadow Epic's sales.
---
Why take away the player's ability to choose a store?
---
Why support distributor exclusivity?
---
"BUT IT'S FREE" Lots of things are free, doesn't mean I want it, nor should they be mandatory. Especially when a much superior also free product is available.

Also learn formatting. Put a few line-breaks in your wall of text next time.

Just means he's immature.

You cannot purchase on [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) anymore. You may be able to purchase a key (sites like cdkeys may have it) and redeem it still, but that is not certain (per [battle.net](https://battle.net) message I received a few days ago).  If you purchase a key and it does not work now, you will be able to use it on Steam Oct. 1.  You will also be able to buy Forsaken on Steam after Oct 1 and it will include the Y2 annual pass content.  It may be easier to continue playing on PS4 for 2 more weeks then switch.

Handheld Supernova. Middle tree void. You hold the grenade button to charge it. It‚Äôs a short range toss but when you land it, it‚Äôs a one shot kill.

I've done this quest now, think I had a little help from Someone in that discord actually

MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

If you do every daily and weekly bounty the Drifter offers you can do it, easy.
---
Hmm rounds heal allies, but the Nobel rounds buff damage. Sounds like the syringes in killing floor I like it

Right now we gotta wait and see how good bottom striker will be in shadowkeep. If its still strong, a duration nerf is fine. As for oem, literally every other "good" titan exotic has something to do with punching, which is ridiculously situational if you're fighting any semi-decent player. It just puts you in danger for no reason because everyone is using shotguns and can shut you down instantly. Oem is the only neutral game exotic titans have that isn't a complete joke, so lots of people use it. if there were other realistic options, I'm sure they would get use. hunters have stompees, frostees and dragons shadow, while warlocks have transversive's, contraverse and ophidians. great neutral game exotics that titans just don't have access to. I just hope bungie doesn't take these "meme" whine posts seriously as the people who post them are usually not great at the game and do not need to be catered to. Especially since nobody ever seems to mention the arguably "broken" things the other two classes have.

I've done that once or twice...and may have put one or two nova bombs into door frames instead their intended destinations....
---
I won‚Äôt say whether or not I‚Äôve sent a nova bomb after a spectral blades.
---
Bwaaaaaaaaaat?
---
pfffft play both (unless its a money thing) plenty of hours to get into b3 then shadow keep hits, then b3 dlc hits and you got a nice rotation going.
---
Very nice
---
I think you get more drops from t3 but the loot pool is larger so there's less likelihood of getting the weapon you're after because some weapons are exclusive to t3. If you're looking for a spare rations t2 is probably fine.
---
This was on twitter earlier. Arby‚Äôs or something. Fun thread
---
Haven't seen this mentioned yet.

I try to strategically bank with my teammates. If I see a teammate sending over a medium or large blocker, I'll send mine as well. Small and medium blockers pair well.  If my teammates are aggressive, I try to clear waves with them and let them send large blockers while I send medium blockers.  If teammates are rationing their deposits I try to go for full stacks of 15 motes.

It's about rhythm with your team.
---
Gah!

I‚Äôm just surprised there were that many people at the farm

I am very average at comp and have found myself being the one to push the lawn mower numerous times. Meanwhile, the enemy team all have riding lawn mowers.

So it sounds like he‚Äôs very partially explaining the mechanics to encounters in the Last Wish raid only. There are many things to know and go over for each raid but I will try to sum them up for you. Every raid has multiple ‚Äúencounters‚Äù that are like separate activities with specific objectives that the entire team needs to work together to complete. When you finish an encounter, the team will then run around and make their way through the raid map to get to the next encounter. For example, in Scourge of the Past, the first encounter has the team running around a city killing specific enemies and taking the orbs they drop to certain parts of the map. There is an actual map in the center that some of the team needs to guard and use to tell the rest of the team where to go. Once enough of the specific enemies are kills and enough of the orbs are deposited, the encounter will be completed and the team will make their way down into a maze. This is not an encounter, but simply a transitional area to the next encounter. They make their way through the maze, get deep into a cave, and start the next encounter there. The main thing with all raid encounters is that communication is key to success. You can‚Äôt have a single person not talking otherwise you won‚Äôt be able to do them. Of course you won‚Äôt always complete an encounter on the first try, but if the team all dies, it‚Äôll simply restart everyone at the encounter you are currently on. The only time it restarts the raid and kicks the team to reset orbit when someone dies is when that team has activated the flawless mode. As far as the time each raid takes, it varies with each team‚Äôs experience and skill level. If you have a bunch of people who are new and learning it for the first time, it will most likely take several hours. If the team has done it a lot or are very skilled players, some longer raids can be done in around an hour or so, and the shorter raids can even be done between 30 minutes to an hour. Hopefully this helps, if you have any more specific questions please feel free to ask.

Sounds like you're talking about the leviathan raid... You've got the basic parts, there are a number of encounters that you have to figure out and require a lot of teamwork and communication,while Being careful not to die.
---
For leviathan, there's the baths, dogs, the gauntlet and finally calus the boss. You have to work through each of the encounters which can take time. If too many people die or something doesn't go to plan then you wipe (everyone kills themselves) which restarts the encounter not the whole raid.
---
Hope this helps :)

Pc community is already large and will probably be the biggest of all of them once it releases on steam for free

When you're near a bad dude and you think you're far enough to throw the melee, you do a huge plunge and melee them instead

Check Spider's inventory on the tangled shore daily.
---
Buying from Spider in the Tangle Shore is always a good source, especially when he is selling the resource you want for glimmer or legendary shards, while also selling glimmer for legendary shards. The quests from the planet vendor also award a fair amount of that planetary material on completion.
---
You could try spider or put on a dual resource scanner on a ghost for titan and do bounties from sloane?
---
1. Spider.
---
2. Titan bounties.
---
3. Strikes or Nightfalls.
---
4. Public events.
---
That‚Äôs about it chief, not much tbh.
---
Check spider daily. Besides that using a ghost that can find chests/ resources while doing Sloane's bounties.
