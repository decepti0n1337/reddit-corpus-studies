NOOOOOOOOOO
---
---
---
Rangefinder doesn't do anything for bows though!
---

---
It's staring at us, *menacingly!*.
---
Good to know I'm not the only one that says fuck the stats go for swag 
---
(Can't believe I said that)
---
r/woooosh
---
HMMM
---
If you played 3 games this week I believe you get 100-150 Glory on reset.
---
I meant the first little encounter, but after watching it again I realize it's on console.
---
They used to be good in vanilla D2. Just dismantle them.
---
One of the worst completely overlooked mechanics in the game since D1 day 1.
---
God that is one unnecessary emoji in the title
---
I don't typically use them but I'll say that it's still great for sure.
---
It sounds cool too.
---
It's just the map bro
---
I only play on PC.  Is LoW crap on console?
---
Because its op?
---
I eagerly await the season of the courier
---
Right back atchya buddy
---
I found this room too
---
Gotta admit I can‚Äôt think of anyone significant that would take one or any reason why it would be gone
---
oh man. what about a season of the burned man...
---
Yes the gun is broken as fuck and has a ttk of like .48 seconds
---
Why does he look more like a twig than I‚Äôm used to
---
Lol
---
Better nerf sparrows
---
Drifter gettin coochie
---
Dick move bud
---
And this person‚Äôs first thought is to take a photo? How about you put your phone down and scan your items with both hands, one obviously isn‚Äôt cutting it.
---
So we‚Äôre not gonna talk about my man running triple snipers
---
Well, no more crucible for me. Not with this nightmare in existence. üò®
---
It‚Äôs cus they spent all theirs in tribute hall
---
Yeah you can still get them from the engrams
---
Amethyst veil or bergusia night
---
Never a bad time for LEG DAY!!
---
Thank you
---
Holy hell, it can be done! Good job, making all us console players proud!
---
Don‚Äôt you mean season of the mailman that can stop time by looking at a fancy watch
---
Juju on that beat
---
Hands down the ugliest thing I've even seen. 
---
I need it.
---
No problem
---
Leviathan 2: electric boogaloo
---
Gravity man. It kills us all the time.
---
Pvp
---
Yikes, yeah if youre a Titan use the damn thing its fun to play but not fun to play against.
---
Oh, I might try it once and not use it again since it is toxic
---
Ask rule 34.
---
I was scrolling fast and I thought that was sandman about to reform into a human from sand
---
Ok cool :)
---
Ok thanks
---
K
---
Is it really that op. I‚Äôm not sure because I haven‚Äôt played in months
---
I mean do what you want
---
Theres a reason he's called the Mad Titan
---
What‚Äôs worse is the fact that this picture was a year ago
---
It was, they nerfed it to where its still usable. If you can win a 1v1 against someone using it, it's useless. But as for you using it it is worth having.
---
Chaos reach super with Geomag stabilizer exotic boots and top tree nova bomb super are extremely good damage supers. Use dawnblade bottom tree super for crucible and for ad clearing.
---
Awesome thank you
---
Gravition lance meta was my favorite of D2
---
Too real!!
---
I laughed way too hard at this, but I needed this today thank you.
---
Just wait until Shadowkeep.
---
They‚Äôll come crawling back.
---
Alright
---
Confirmed. Savathun is a Hunter
---
I‚Äôm not sure if this is just a placeholder or not, but when Bungie showed the new eververse ornament system in the vidoc, the base armor without the ornaments was that old armor.
---
AFK SWITCHING TO MALL COP.
---
Theres space for a raid at the top of the leviathan menu, theres bound to be one there.
---
Congrats! That‚Äôs pretty amazing
---
Rivens curse does give 5% more damage per mod, but also makes enemies deal 5% more than you.
---
I saw the OG titan armor so hopefully that's a sign but it might be place holder
---
‚ÄúA Guardian Has Left The Fireteam‚Äù
---
Can‚Äôt wait for bottom tree Dawnblade to break the crucible
---
So was BB.
---
Auto-rifle and sub-machine gun were the weapons I was using.
---
Well this is the best news I've heard all week! Always gonna welcome more fur for my titan
---
I always wondered what a true pve god looked like. Then I watched this video. Now I can go to sleep satisfied. Well done guardian.
---
1- every super is op in mayhem.
---
2- this post is about PvP, everyone knows tether is one of the best supers for PvE
---
I remember in Halo 3 I would do the same thing. There was a guy afk on the end of the map and i had the sniper. I took a solid 30 seconds to line up this shot from realizing he was there and afk and pulling the trigger. Was sure as soon as I shot he would move. Instead his team mate ran around the corner and i got two headshots with one bullet. Never has my heart raced so much with the snipwe as trying to take out a guy who hasn't moved in a hot minute.
---
Yeah, it was a 6 stack infinitely putting down bubbles. It was an insane match!
---
No, I‚Äôm saying that if you take away it‚Äôs only good feature you need to give it another one that is as good. As it is you will be slapping every player that went through the trouble of mountaintop in the face by nerfing it, it‚Äôs the hardest pinnacle to get other than Not Forgetten so it deserves to be worth its grind. Take away its damage, sure.  But give it something to fill that gap because otherwise MT will be a trash gun with a terribly hard quest to obtain
---
In my previous posts I was referring to PC, and I watched a couple runs of people on PC. I don't know what you're talking about. The only reason people wiped was Bad Dps and Wrong Eye. Those other reason barely ever happened.
---
Haven‚Äôt played destiny in a couple so it took me a while to get but..hehehe that‚Äôs funNy
---
One glimmer can make all the difference...to those who have the POOR üÖ±Ô∏è
---
Bruh you were using autorifles and smgs. Thats normal dmg. No issues here
---
Truuuue
---
Ah yes, the auto-rocket launcher to finally take down Lord of Wolves.
---
You can make copies of shaders you've gotten before from the collections tab. 
---
Shaders come from opening chests, turning in materials or tokens to NPCs, and, once you reach max level, you will get an eververse engram every time you fill up the xp bar.
---
Yes the player still gets beat by LoWüòÇüòÇ
---
Burst and tap mean the same thing, no one says how many shots are in a burst
---
If you mean the venedict quest that grants you 690 gear, you dont need the anual pass, I dont have it and it lets you do everything, included 1 menagerie run (That you need for the last part of the quest line)
---
Maybe this could compete agains recluse?
---
It is a two burst that three taps
---
Yeah but the cats ain‚Äôt dummy thicc
---
It truly is a great community. If I need help, I can just ask!
---
Oh, P.S.: Moon‚Äôs Haunted
---
As soo as you shoot everything just goes white and nothing is left alive
---
Seems like youre turning a blind eye to the bad aswell
---
Can I get the armor if I‚Äôm only lvl 30?
---
But you would still run into bad players in your placement matches...
---
Preach it!
---
Dude when do we get it?
---
Like the I in the Pixar opening lmao
---
Oh, now I remember. I always used to joke around and say that Mara only had a throne world because she got her entire fleet clapped by Oryx.
---
You know people've gotten mad at me for saying Mara would've been nothing without Riven?
---
Riven definitely helped, but she had an entire race of powerful beings following her. And they were ahead of humanity in technology.
---
This guy is impossible at this point he has to be a troll.
---
He just needed to know if the guide would apply to you man
---
It‚Äôs sexy
---
See ya ^later
---
Still, as a person she wasn't all that special. Sure, she was a queen, but even that power was basically there because the Awoken people allowed her to have it. I catch heat for hating the Awoken (long story there) so I tend to be careful about criticizing them.
---
I understood that reference
---
the only shotguns meta i want is slug shotguns cause they take some actual skill.
---
There's probably some other paracausal powers she had, perhaps being queen had her in a similar tithing position as the hive. But beyond that I have no real answer, only speculation
---
Thank you and I am also irritated by the title, I will change it if I can a find a way to do it
---
Huh. Well now maybe I can drop some knowledge on the kids I work with. Thanks!
---
"Ain't that the truth"
---
Np ;)
---
Can I put a paper bag over your head?
---
Down to the city and up again.
---
Down and up again. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Toland is a jerk lol. When I first "met" him in the Dreaming City, I'm like, "Who is this sassy, lost, disembodied spirit?" Thrn I remembered Eris Morn's journal. I'm like, wow, never meet the author.
---
This shit happened to me then lost 2 games I hated it
---
Still waiting on kink tho
---
You don‚Äôt need the pinnacle weapons to have a decent go at pvp. I‚Äôm a lifetime 0.9 K/D in crucible (was 0.7 for most of D1, so have improved...). I‚Äôve been using only Leviathan armor and weapons (Inaugural Address, Midnight Coup) this entire IB for that Tribute Hall triumph and have been mostly over 1.0 K/D. Pinnacle weapons aren‚Äôt the key. Those guardians using them, mopping the floor with you, are just that good.
---
Excuse me your what
---
Has he really been doing that? Do I just not pay attention at all
---
That won't be necessary thank you ! 
---
:'D
---
Old but gold?
---
I can give you a month of content that‚Äôs just me being physiqued info walls
---
working as intended /s
---
It made you feel good because after a long day because you have two jobs. You work at wherever the hell and your lther work is being a guardian.
---
And being a guardian is the only place where people show appreciation for you.
---
I had to watch that video again 
---
Its soo bad its good
---
feature, not a bug.
---
for about a week now, yeah
---
If he‚Äôs already fabled this season you will be matchmaking off of his glory not yours.
---
Whatever you're doimg and defeat enemies...
---
Had to finish your comment :)
---
Imagine starting up a Like A Diamond attempt and this is how it begins
---
I‚Äôve been trying for 3 months and I don‚Äôt think it gonna happen.
---
Yeah man. Go look. He should be doing it right now
---
Is this really happening in the tower since reset? I love Bungie if they really did this lol
---
Can someone explain, for my friend
---
D1 had Best pvp ever. Unrivalled to this day.
---
Drifter is Han Solo
---
I completely understand hating PVP... I finally jumped into iron banner, and while I got hammered the first few rounds I finally started getting a little better. Practice really does make you better and I eventually ticked of nearly all the crucible type quests I'd been holding off on. two valor resets and some comp later and I've almost got a pinnacle weapon from crucible too.
---
I hope not. Devs will destroy it like they did with bannerfal. Super cramped like every other map apart from equinox and couple others
---
Wait we get what
---
Shaxx: **"I...** Don't actually have a medal for this...hang on!"
---
So thats where that went!
---
I can never do the crying pod heroic because of this
---
Damn, inspires a true ship.
---
It should get a nerf not a KILL
---
Nerf vengeance by removing the damage buff and remove some health from the over-shield and it‚Äôll be balanced not killed
---
Yeah but don't worry, it's a planet killer.
---
Quite a confusing question I have here. I'm buying Destiny 2 for my cousin on his birthday, but I am worried I would be wasting money if I bought it now. What is the right course of action considering there is Shadowkeep on Steam and Forsaken on Battlenet currently? I want my cousin to get all the content but I don't want to waste any money that I don't have to. 
---
I know this is a slightly confusing question, so please if there is anything I can answer then just ask.
---
I miss this map, I miss Universal Remote, I miss Tiny Dance.  Bungo plz.
---
The 3rd on on Nessus.
---
I bought Destiny 2 after forsaken came out, and always had more pursuits than I could hold. I'm assuming I abandoned the quest to try to free up more space without realizing what it was.
---
That is really convicting now that you mention it again.
---
I have not made it to the end game yet, but I want so badly to understand what this all means.
---
Time will tell, but I feel like I have a huge, steep learning curve in front of me, but one that will be fun to straighten out.
---
RNG period. Nothing more nothing less. Honestly i dont even think those tokens work.
---
I do this all the time with warlock &amp; balanced glide.  
---
People really underestimate how long I can float there and still get back.
---
Use an OP roaming super and weapons. Ex: Bottom tree striker titan, Dawnblade, Jotuun, erentil etc.
---
 Stick with the team even if they take routes on the map you don't like, unless you are confident in your 1v1, 1v2, flanking scenarios.
---
 Clash, Control are straightforward. When planting the bomb in other game modes, wait to plant until you get one enemy dead, or good area control. Remember the importance of revives. 
---
If you start getting tilted, stop playing for the day. I played until I lost 2 in a row, then just came back the next day. It may seem slow but you still have a month and a half to get Fabled, so plenty of time. 
---
Don't quit matches early. Play at least 3 full games a week and get some extra bonus points each weekly reset, up to 120 I believe when you are a rank under Fabled. So you really only need to hit 1980 points in the end, and just wait for reset.
---
Lastly, that I can think of atm, is decide if you want to solo queue or not. I tried a few lfg groups but ended up winning more games when I went in solo. There are also streamers that do free comp help you can team up with if you search em out.
---
Good luck in getting it done. It's not a matter of "if" you will get 2100, but when. Be consistent and dont give up, you'll get it.
---
A Double-Penetrating Unkempt Harold?
---
If you're using the Wing Discipline gauntlets you're already unworthy of any 750 gear
---
bug due to completed bounty. Opening your pursuits tab fixes it. Also, I believe they are issuing a fix today with the reset.
---
FIIIIIGHT FOREVER GUARDIIIAN
---
There was a tweet from dmg that hinted at there being at least two more. Sorry I don't have a link
---
Thanks I try all of these out oh but what tree is good for hunter?
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the help!
---
Ggs! What was your gamertag ;)
---
This is my all time favorite Shaxx line.
---
When I first heard it in D2, I hollered.
---
Stop floating!
---
That event ended. It‚Äôs random drop now.
---
I think every community has its ups and downs, you get great people like this but you also get people like the guy who messaged me last night saying he was going to report me for lag switching and calling me various slur because I killed him with arbalest (he also did something similar in the same match to my friend after he ‚Äútanked two fusion rifle shots‚Äù).
---
Also shout out to all you guys on LFG saying people must have cleats but they end up being the ones have to be carried.
---
Arbalest is part of the loot pool now. The Revelary is over so you have to rely on RNGesus. Goodluck guardian
---
I made a titan, just to abuse the OEM. I am sick of being at a disadvantage just for shooting someone. I was not here for the buffed wormhusk, so I don't know that meta. All I know is I feel MUCH stronger now that I am a bottom tree striker, with OEM.
---
Thanks
---
Panoptes_FaceMe. You won by quite a margin üò≠üò≠
---
Tried Fortnite.  Tried Apex Lengends.  Tried the Cally of Duty Royale.  Just......uh.....meh.
---
Sick thanks
---
I don‚Äôt know how to feel about this....
---
Also Mara: I'm already taken.
---
I would absolutely love this.
---
That event ended months ago. She was here for Christmas but that‚Äôs it. Yo have to get arbalest from just a normal exotic drop. It‚Äôs pure rng now
---
You just want then to add more stuff and make it harder. Unless you give examples of how they can increase replayability and make loot worth while, adding new content is meaningless. People will just beat it once and be too board to do it again. The activities have to be fun and engaging. Not like crown of sparrow's first encounter where it's like, stand here, shoot stuff, dont die. Also planets aren't the endgame of destiny, so there is no reason for them to be repayable. Raids, strikes, crucible, and other activities like reckoning and menagerie are the endgame, and what needs to focused on, Not planets
---
I didn‚Äôt know shaxx and Mara had a thing
---
Was this a ps4 exclusive or am I trippin
---
Every time I even skim the surface of vex milk now I‚Äôm going to be reminded of this... thanks a lot.
---
All of Ice Bear's friends are future enemies.
---
Or me too buddy, me too.
---
Don't forget, after losing two games, stop. It'll only go down from there and you'll get tilted and loose more progress. Instead stop playing comp at the very least and try again a different day
---
How do we know it's console? 
---
Oh yeah look at that sweet, sweet menu load time.
---
Nice work dude!
---
It's a console nerf. When something is overused, game developers tend to bring it down a bit
---
How is this possible?  How was he grinding for these?
---
My buddy and I did Crown last night, and he ran an Edge Transit with Spike Grenades and put up a respectable 5.5 Mil damage. 
---
I think people are putting a bit too much importance on Swarm of the Raven. Sure its THE best, but Edge Transit with Spike grenades does just SLIGHTLY less. 
---
Its definitely not the only heavy worth running.
---
wait 1-2h for Solstice of heroes
---
#no
---
I have a Edgy Transit (called so because I threw a dead orbit shader on it) with spike rangefinder and a velocity mw. Velocity while all be it slightly does matter when calculating direct impact damage.
---
I would suggest a more SJW type of game like overwatch, they ban people everyday for saying mean words. I think it would suit you pretty well.
---
Call in the Fallen.
---
Been shut down outta your super a few times, eh ?
---
Why is this downvoted? It‚Äôs cool
---
I‚Äôd argue all 4 are fairly similar in terms of obtainability. It really boils down to whether or not everything falls in your favor.
---
If you really want one though, your best bet is gonna be to go for ‚Äúgambit‚Äù or ‚Äúa shadow rises‚Äù.
---
Gambit still requires some rng l, but it you grind out the month you can prob get it. ‚ÄúA shadow rises‚Äù is a fair amlint if work and rng, but you have till December to get it so you can plan things out for between now and then.
---
Keep in mind that you‚Äôll still be able to get all the deals after August, these time limits are only for getting the real world pin.
---
For the first few seconds I didn‚Äôt realize this was D1 and my brain went into a fit like ‚Äúthis map is back? Is it a PS4 exclusive? How do I get this map back I want this map back I had so much fun on this map tell me who I have to kill to get this map back.‚Äù
---
Man I miss that map. So much that I can‚Äôt even remember its name.
---
ADA sounds like a Tsundere to me so...
---
An Ape on his natural habitat, Is that a shotgun i see?
---
Dont suck at PVP? Idk what to say
---
Become what you hate, use every cheap meta you can
---
Yeah hopefully, its way too overpowered
---
Those architects are loathesome bastards, for sure.
---
I heard you liked bubbles, so I put a bubble inside your bubble.
---
Haha xD
---
Mission: DEFEAT ALL ENEMIES
---
Just be patient
---
This goes out to EVERY SINGLE one of you invaders using the truth and tea bagging like you are good at the game. I have NEVER invaded with power weapons. It's just not fun, I could just as easily come in with a Hammerhead and destroy an entire team but that requires me losing 2.6m brain cells.
---
If you're not gonna be part of the discussion in a serious way dude please stop commenting. I don't have time for racist children. You're probably one of the people who sends these messages which in turn makes you part of the problem. I'm not talking about just Destiny, I'm talking about games in general.
---
What about nova bomb? the original fucking BB? lmao. Nobody every complained until it was a hunter subclass.
---
Im sure it will be 3 or 4 months I hope not but that is my guess
---
Monochromatic or bust
---
Basically all I am saying is that while Swarm might to THE MOST damage, Edge Transit and others can still put up plenty enough damage to one phase Ghalran. 
---
Just trying to ease peoples minds a bit that Swarm of the Raven isn't the only good weapon for boss DPS.
---
I got the triumph shirt for 2018, took about 2 and a 1/2  weeks for me to get it.
---
My GameStop had these and a little Cayde figure still in the back and they gave them both to me a few months ago.
---
Rocket Launcher -&gt; Cluster Bombs.. Why you may ask? Ill tell you why, its because MOONS HAUNTED.
---
Done now for me
---
it was fixed with current maintenance.
---
Same.Have fun during solstice!
---
Then just don't play.
---
Its on
---
Very constructive argument :)
---
I want this as an emote
---
I'm buying it today lol
---
Sh- she left me for her heccing brother.. Was it because the helmet stayed on?
---
[Here](https://www.niris.tv/blog/hpe) is a list of current events and their heroic triggers.

---
Screenshots are the play on stuff like this my guy
---
Time to boost that kd, bro.
---
No.
---
I can‚Äôt *not* read this in his voice.
---
What armour are you wearing?
---
I gotta ask, do you just assume anyone that has a good game in comp is a recov or is there something else?
---
  Thanks man!
---
On steam, there is only shadowkeep, on blizzard the game is 40$ ish so no it‚Äô s not 110$...
---
Check the price
---
Is your post actually a joke? Or where you being serious though? Your last sentence states it's a joke but not clear if Destiny 2 is the joke, or the post.
---
I don‚Äôt remember that at all so it must have been a ps4 exclusive.
---
Beacause every violent teenager is playing cs and kids are playing fortnite or minecraft our community is really nice and peaceful  :D
---
Are you ok, junior? Spill some Dew in your Razer keyboard?
---
Serves you for not using solar lel.
---
Probably would have a better time in pvp if he wasnt using celestial nighthawk
---
My question is once you complete a piece of armor, how do you turn it in to get the upgrade? Do you need to have the full set complete to get the next set? 
---
Again, sorry if this has been answered but I haven‚Äôt found it yet.
---
Why do they say strikers op it can‚Äôt even move
---
*Defeat enemies
---
Some people just can't loose
---
Are you talking about Shadowkeep? 'Cause that's on the moon, and the Black Garden is on Mars.
---
Oh alright. It didn‚Äôt really state anywhere they they can drop from any activity. Thanks
---
Do you use the advanced blink exotic? Blink has always been just absolutely terrible in this game IMO. Wondering if the exotic helps at all
---
So I was just on Bungie's forum, and they said the emblems will be released later in the week.

I didn't know that they're adding that much in one DLC. Thanks for the info!
---
i dont have it yet, rrrrrrrrrrreally wish I did. 
---
Still punishing to miss your landing as a warlock though, we dont have any jumps that push us upwards other than the one you do with your legs initially.
---
I dont know why people would do that haha, funny how many people say something about my name though!
---
True, but then I wouldn't have the Lord of wolves emblem or anything else I've done in the past year+.  Oh well. Things happen.
---
Just dive in and start quest do daily stuff and be a guardian
---
i was writing this out of frustration
---
Never said anything to an expectation to get everything. Also never said anything about leveling up.
---
To sum up, I said one simple thing: Bungie is now overkilling the grind unless you are a hardcore player.

If you have season pass theres a ton of stuff to do

1200 per armor slot, so 6000 total

---
I also played on 9 dec crucible... ü§îü§î
---
I had to get kills with arc equipped for one of the titan armor pieces lol
---
Cuz of that sexy freeze-frame pose. It's all about aesthetics.
---
No. I didnt get really into crucible until this season.
---
No worries!  Info doesn't always get across all the Destiny subreddits so it can be missed.
---
Nobody got them yet as far as I know. Pretty sure last week's IB counted if you played then.
---
No it isn't. The requirements go up with every armor tier. So it starts at 10, + 10 matches, then the requirements get more and more cancerous.
---
You can still get it the legit way. Bungie is not punishing anyone so it's fine, I guess
---
Its pretty fun
---
Dmg said it will be later this week for the emblems
---
Do you have source? :)
---
They are coming later this week. Dmg tweeted that out earlier.

---
Huh?
---
Dont do it then.
---
Yea I'm not miffed about that, just wanted to make sure you knew about rule #1/disclaimer as the wording in your post indicated you might be trying to reach someone at bungie! It's pretty rough trying to solo-queue comp, I finally gave in this weekend and hopped on my Titan and ran OEM, LoW, and bottom striker just trying to get past brave III.
---
I thought it was a community-made joke. I really need to read the lore more, props to Bungie!
---
Lol...Drop mag can sure be pain if you forget you have it on.
---
Oh my god Bungie pls
---
It only works on banshee as far as I can tell
---
Ok so simply amazing was all I needed to hear. I will definitely  be doing this in the coming days
---
well deserved medals
---
Right after you ended a Gunslingers whole career. Feels bad.
---
Do some research you casual and stop bitching. Don‚Äôt expect everyone to hold your hand.
---
probably sat on his phone while he gets a free win lucky guy
---
Sometime this week
---
understandable
---
Ok I wasn't around during the first one so thanks for the clarification
---
This is beautiful and all but damn annoying when your trying to get to a miniboss
---
You didn‚Äôt take that coin out of your pants before putting it in the Fallen washing machine.
---
What a fucking rude piece of shit, fuck you you toxic, cunty, musty rats asshole
---
Function just like ornaments.
---
Shut up and take my Bright Dust
---
Cool
---
Do orbs drop that much?
---
Make this an emote
---

---
Well nowadays professional gaming is a life for some people. They make alot of money off of it. It is basically their life.

---
Okay but why
---
Quick question 
---
Why
---
Oryx is already sexy we don‚Äôt need this
---
I wonder what back story is to image
---
1st person to do it gets a free collectors edition of shadowkeep
---
As a recall last year it was max light when fully upgraded to Legendary. Might be the same this year
---
I did 4 t3‚Äôs and got like 100 just now. For anyone needing to do reckoning, just lfg fireteam. So much simpler.
---
DFA may be a year 1 HC but its crisp as hell
---
Ohhh boiii its grenade launcher frustration time!
---
Just ask Mara Sov -OH WAIT
---
Changes with the curse. There will be a new boss next reset.
---
They can drop with different shaders on them. Shadow guilt is the most common shader though.
---
Photo op more than likely
