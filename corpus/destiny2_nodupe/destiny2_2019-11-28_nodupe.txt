Name me one that will better deal with Barrier Champions in a 980 Nightfall, and from a safe distance?

Eriana's is incredibly useful for the 920, 950, and 980 Nightfall Ordeals.

Do you know the runes I need?

lol right? 'dabble' is the epitome of a humble brag for an unbroken player lol
---
MAAMAAAAAAA! JUST KIL- sorry wrong song
---
I've gotten at least 8 of these and I have 40 hours of playtime...
---
Honest recluse with anti barrier is better as it's great ad clear with good damage and doesn't take up your special ammo or exotic slot
---
I too came to this realization and it explains my .67 kd ratio.
---
Check your settings, they might've been reset after the update even though that may be unlikely
---
I wanna something about EDZ or maybe EP on Mars but I could be wrong.
---
The sweats haha
---
Is there any easy ways to farm exotic engrams on Nessus
---
You have to be sprinting for a couple of seconds to shield bash.  Unless you're in super.
---
I’ve seen more reposts on this subreddit than the number of nuts my grandma has
---
Come the next patch, the knife WILL be a one hit ;) eyes up hunter
---
UV rays are my natural enemy

I know, but it should have been in the first place
---
After 701 matches, and 108 hours in the crucible in my "Destiny Career":
---
.77 KD and a 1.17 KDA
---
I've obtained Revoker, Recluse, Mountaintop, Lunas and am sitting at 4,304 Glory
---
Point being, if I can do it, anyone can
---
It‘a like the portal scene in Endgame but way less cool.
---
Then title the post correctly
---
Its is one of my favorite exotics. Grinded the catalyst and it rocks. Like others have said hight lvl content it shines. I use it in the dungen mostly during solo runs. 
---
In pvp you can nasty 2 tap. Or use lucky pants and swap to a primary handgun for faster two taps.
---
Old news, but it’s worth noting that the order of the terminals activating is random. Not all of them activate per sequence. 
---
It’s too bad the ball can’t evolve into the huge Traveler-looking one, though.
---
Are you just having a bad day? Hunters are very good in pvp
---
It's somewhat worth the effort even though you don't get exotics over the course of them, unless you count the odd engram drop, but the XP is fine. To my knowledge Shadowkeep is the only one offering a full set of armour and an exotic during the course.
---
But this guy got was so still, I almost thought he was afk. So what he did was shine bullshit!
---
They are all effective killers I don’t see your point /s
---
Come to r/fightinglion we have some posts that are tips on how to use it.
---
As a hunter main, I feel like you’re not using all of the hunters strengths. Such as smaller hit box, dodging, triple jumps. I will admit I’ve gotten mad at titans for the no skill shoulder charge or warlock pocket nova bomb but hunter is has its strengths also
---
I have a warlock friend and we tested all warlock supers against the Way of the Current. And it was indeed something when we saw how it an deflect a Nova bomb. Unfortunately you cannot delect the one that periodically damages. Dawnblade you can deflect as well. But anything else will kill you xD
---
It's in the image douchebag
---
I’m partly pondering on the fact that you actually got a snapshot Long Goodbye to drop. I grinded Insight Teminus nightfall the whole last week, 3 hours per day, with a 200k emblem. I got a Long Goodbye almost every run but it had no damn snapshots. None of them. I was very pissed and decided I was wasting my time. I really want a long goodbye with snapshots......
---
When you are level 904 and kill level 960 player in iron banner.
---
Here I thought I'm the only potato in crucible
---
How are you turning and moving around so fast? What's your mobility? I just came back to d2 and it feels like my character is wearing a neckbrace when I try to turn
---
This happened to me last night, I closed the force closed the game app and restarted the game then the bounties started working.
---
It's a week long.
---
Still Nub numbers soooooo
---
Well, we have shields, powered by the Light. 
---
Real answer &gt;!Hunters arms are too skinny and frail to throw the knife hard enough!&lt;
---
I applaud you, fellow guardian, for your honesty for I too am shit
---
Exactly my thoughts when i first played IB
---
That too, but in general, split based are pretty garbage, and invis is garbage. Grenades usually don't kill for us, and our supers take forever to actually start. Plus, dodge is fucking useless for PvP. Titans have shields, which is helpful, and, healing rifts, or empowering rifts. Both are helpful for pvp. You know what isn't helpful for PvP? Your special ability being a sidestep
---
I am having fun being a void hunter, bottom tree.
---
Stack discipline, granades last longer, suppression, even when i die i take 2-3 enemies with me.
---
Pairing this build with fr0st-EE5 boots, wich basiclly gives me granade, dodge and invisibility avaliability all the time.
---
They are called "shitlibs".
---
Can confirm. I’ve got Melee binder to TAB from my days playing The Division and The Division 2. I don’t feel like changing muscle memory. Also the C was always my crouch key.
---
mini heart attack
---
I cant remember the names exactly but I'm fairly certain you need green runes unlocked.
---
Google the recipe.
---
You didn't just kill him his relatives and loved ones dropped dead as well.  Fuck.
---
I cannot believe the amount of these I’ve gotten.  I don’t even look at what perks are on them anymore, I just auto dismantle them.
---
Is this a known bug or something?  I’ve literally gotten 10+ of them in the last couple weeks.
---
This right here got my questline done for randys throwing knife. God that took forever.
---
*That moment when the enemy's primeval is nearly dead and a vet invader gets clutch.*
---
I have frostees, grenade is just a normal grenade and invis isn't actually invis. Still outclassed by other classes
---
Feel like an ass now, sort of bombed ahead during the nightfall to get it done, I was confused to why a dude was wondering about when I was waiting before I jumped in
---
You gotta use it right
---
Mida multi w/ *calus* mini tool
---
God i wish that were me
---
Yes, there was a d1 crucible map based in it. The area was called the Eastern Flood Zone so we just assume it’s NA
---
the raid doesn't have any heavy weapons.....
---
Mountaintop unless you’re going for the undying title in which case do randys
---
Yah you’re right just the projectiles afterwards
---
Anyone else disappointed the other 3 players didn't show up to continue the chain of killing and teabagging?
---
Idk maybe people actually want to feel accomplished for winning and getting kills.
---
It would be awesome if we helped failsafe move over to an exo unit seeing she’s stuck on that planet by herself.
---
Not sure why so many of you can’t comprehend a simple question, as if you’ve nvr played on an account other then yours and been like “damn I wish I had some of these things on my main” I’m asking literally FOR FUN Jesus Christ I’d think A simple fucking question like that wouldn’t be so hard for you people to understand like are you all fucking retarded or all of you just can’t read?
---
If I had a penny for each pixel in this video, I might be able to barely afford a bag of candy with them.

I have less than a handful of friends that play so I’m usually solo. I’d like to join the discord if possible

Can we please just bring back factions like they were in D1? It would give me something to grind for cause that’s what most of my time consisted of. Why does bungie ruin good things..
---
Randy’s because it’s going away in two weeks.
---
I know I’m right. Even having played 0 hours on hunter this season I could tell you it can’t tank nova bomb.
---
Camp heavy and use a prox nade play of the game, you'll have it in now time
---
this has been an issue since launch for me. i constantly get kicked from the tower.

You could lfg

Ruined it with teabagging

I just admitted that you were^
---
Don't forget both raid snipers: Alone as a God (Leviathan) and Omniscient Eye (GoS). They have some of the highest aim assist in the game and short zoom scopes.

Eh...I’m still gonna push him off the tower.
---
I appreciate the time you put into your response. I won’t be able to give a fleshed our response now, but I’ll edit my comment to reply later.

You pick up the campaign and then hold LT or whatever when you're in the director and the tab shows up
---
You need to run heroic menagerie.
---
Never waste your diamonds on a hoe smh
---
It was far worse in early beta when pick and bans were at random and there were no coms during the phase so you couldn’t actually plan anything with randoms.  I don’t usually just quit games I enjoyed for a long time right off the bat.
---
That was the first game I said “fuck this” and never went back.
---
All season of IB I think I've only ever came across one stacked team.
---
It’s of note he technically wasn’t allowed to leave but he left anyway. The vanguards authority is super limited in a lot a ways. For example Zavala didn’t want us to go kill Uldren but we did anyway. 
---
Cayde was never punished for leaving and our guardian could do basically whatever we want with no consequences as long as we aren’t hurting the city
---
Got the game specifically to check out the crucible, was totally addicted to pvp in the first destiny. Like it so far !

How many times you gotta post this
---
It's the standard shadow keep that only has the current season pass which only lasts for 12/13 more days. Deluxe has the current season pass and the next 3 season passes.
---
Solo. Kinderguardian.
---
It refreshes every week. I simply meant there are other activities where your time would be better spent until the 100k nightfall is one of your only options.
---
If the darkness had a voice, this would be it
---
many times
---
"I call BS!!!" - the other team. Damn I miss this game :(
---
I assume you're asking for the Sturm and Drang quest. For that step you don't actually have to pick up the engrams on Nessus, they can be anywhere. Doing activities with a lot of yellow or orange bar enemies is most efficient, so doing stuff like the dungeon or vex offensive will be best.
---
oh wait my bad it glitched and i posted it many times i deleted the others sorry
---
It only happened because the nine willed it so
---
This is how I feel when I play comp with 2 potatoes.
---
So deluxefor 25$ more is the better deal then in that case?
---
Which sniper is this?
---
You must visit the beautiful, strong, and independent, Amanda Holiday and ask her politely to bestow you the quest line.  Make sure to bring her a whole set of tools from the golden age or she will not gift you with her presence.
---
Didn't he also complete shattered throne at 999 light level?
---
I believe they were likely trying to get the triumph where you kill a guardian with 15 motes held.
---
looks great
---
I think he did
---
MIDA
---
Yeah @evanf1997 made a video about it on YouTube
---
I always feel a bit bad too, like fuck, they got stuck with *me*.

I do ok in Free For All and decent in Gambit Prime though. I feel I can ignore the pvp aspects of GP and focus on the rest while still being a decent team mate and contributing.

---
Where is it this week?
---
Open up the in game pause menu and go to the far right tab where it says Seasons.  There will be a number and it will give you your season rank.
---
i could be remembering it wrongly but i think relentless strikes is the one that gives ammo back on consecutive hits? that's a better roll for boss dps since you could just use a primary for add clear
---
Legend isn’t a grind though. I’m a new destiny player, been playing about 6-7 weeks. Didn’t pvp for the first 4 and I hit legend this weekend just gone. Granted I have 5k hours in CS:GO though so there’s some transferable skill there, but it’s just not as hard as a lot of people make out. Don’t be discouraging!

What were you using?

Is this a question?
---
Dota?
---
You can sprint cancel and immediately fire, try it. Have your secondary out while sprinting, then swap while holding ADS. You will instantly draw, scope, and be able to shoot. There is also a Quickdraw cancel for Warlock Glide and Titan Lift, but none for Hunter. It's been in the game since D1. In this clip however, he just swaps fast since he's using Ophidian Aspect.
---
What’s all the armor?
---
Nice golden gun w/ Nighthawk

Another thing about rose turning into Lumina, I'm unsure if it was just myself who has ran into this problem but for some reason the lumina might be down one light level so it may frustrate you

While everyone is going YOU WHAT?! I’ll be pulling out my sniper to kill his ghost and him
---
&gt;”Wave goodbye to yer head, mate!”
---
I'd recommend a Stryker's Sure Hand with Relentless Strike (Landing 3 light attacks grants ammo), Whirlwind Blade and a backup mag mod (It actually increases how much "ammo" you carry).
---
I love using that thing. I can just spam light attacks on bosses pretty much forever (Thanks to Relentless Strike), while still doing a nice amount of damage (Thanks to Whirlwind Blade).
---
 
---
With Hungry Edge and the backup mag mod, my ammo capacity goes to 70. Then you add Relentless Strike... Hehehe.
---
As for defence, I'd recommend a Burst Guard since you're using Stronghold. It gives you a ton of defence, while the gauntlets remove the downside of it.
---
Are they wearing the event mask? It has no power level now that the even is over so will automatically drop you 100 levels
---
Understatement of the day.
---
Is he wearing a piece of armor that isn't 750? There are old armor pieces that have no light value. Or even super low light values.
---
Either way, he's wearing something he shouldn't be and that's why.
---
Very nice.  Probably does about as much DPS as the real one!
---
no no im talking about the titans that WERE playing fair
---
not the damn strikers. although i cant say shit since i technically am a striker user since i use code of the missile. No oem tho
---
Ah
---
I wish  you could just free  roam more and explore  and be able to open  doors so many walls  that we can go trough  unless you glitch

Cool! When the Altar of Sorrows first came out, my first pinnacle completion was with Slayerage...and the last Gambit match that gave me Exit Strategy, I was pitted against Byf with other randoms. This season was my favorite just because of the cool people I've gotten to play with/against!
---
I'm pretty sure it's whatever your melee attack is bound to
---
The loading times while traveling are already long, imagine how long it would take to load if the worlds were huge and open.
---
Isn’t the difference between 100-90 or 90-80 like only 6 seconds or something. Those stat points are better used else where.
---
I like this idea. Share some stories with people who _aren’t_ guardians. Life must be very different for them.
---
That’s the curated roller right?
---
They make raids work, why not a small section city?
---
ok
---
Lmfao this shit about bit box is small that's not a thing literally all characters are the same height so fucking stupid honestly, it's been this way since D1. Please literally do some research before saying some dumb shit. Titan main here. I literally play all 3 classes and playing hunter is easily the Easiest class to play on Easiest to stay alive best jump for pvp. Like you get a dodge that reloads your guns???? Breaks tracking flame bolts and arc bolts when you do it? Hmmmmmm. Um not to mention if you spec out right and you basically can black every super with middle tree arcstrider lmao this Is comically about someone who has had a bad time and probably doesnt have a good KD. I suggest you put your actual gamer tag up and show how decent you are because it just sounds like you have 2 left hands and you have terrible map and radar awareness. And you're maybe super bad at shooting?. Anyways get better man. Hunter are the most used in the game for a reason they're super good like ALL 3 classes then it comes titan and warlock honestly has the highest skill GAP to master them in the game.
---
But why would you?
---
Would be cool man but sadly we can't  even  to interact  with the people  have an option  to talk with them just  for a bit

Oh look its my shoulder crying buddy.
---
I'd lfg it its tricky at that light even with 3 ppl but completely achievable just say your 967 should be all good :)
---
Black talon.  The right click attack is very fast and the projectiles are high damage.  Only issue is it forces you to step forwards each attack, which can be an issue up close as you could walk past the enemy.
---
Dude, when you're saltier than the High Lord you have a problem. Chill tf out.

---
Weird, I've never seen a Bygones with more range or impact than a Go Figure. I would think i would since Go Figure has a higher fire rate, but I just haven't seen it, making Bygones seem pretty obsolete. I'll keep my eyes peeled I guess!
---
True
---
Did you rank up tour infamy?
---
Nice repost
---
I see, I guess sometimes it's more about the feel of a gun than the stats! I've never had trouble with Go Figure so I'll just keep doing my thing. That sheds some light though!
---
Thats what I have been doing, i get the Sub Machinist like 5-6 times in one match and it doesn't even move at all.

You know they were triggered...

#MeInComp

?
---
is vex milk
---
I don't know why, but I'm reading that in Cayde's voice with an air of disbelief.
---
Also a melee charge is worth less than a grenade charge (generally), so you’d rather give up melee than grenade. Although to be fair, nova warp’s melee and grenade are probably the most busted in the entire game.
---
I'm a solo player as well on PC, would love to raid with anyone interested - steam tag is Jez2590
---
Iron banner medals don't count I believe.
---
How would you call nova warps melee the most busted? Sure it does the most damage barring a shoulder charge, but it's got a delay to the explosion
---
I miss all the destiny armour themes destiny 2 armour looks crap in comparison
---
Dam saw some posts around saying they would add them to nostalgic engrams eventually
---
Looking?
---
What's that transmat effect? I need it for my Wings of Sacred Dawn build.
---
Ace gave him a new hole
---
The only thing I hate so far (aside from the still stale state of PvP) is the final raid challenge.
---
It's not a real challenge. Unless of course you count beating your head against an RNG wall until you win a challenge.
---
There's bugs everywhere in the final encounter that will probably never be fixed and the mechanics of the challenge itself aren't difficult to grasp, however when you're on a timer for your motes and banking, then the boss decides to take the floor directly behind the conflux's, you're in trouble. That and the good old bug that's been in gambit since its inception, the one where you can't pick up motes....
---
Oh you have 5 seconds to get a mote or you start the challenge again? Whoops, can't pick that mote up, try another. Whoops, can't pick that up either, aaaaand times up. Wipe and start again.
---
I won't be doing this challenge agai n once it's done for the triumph. Its terrible quality for a challenge and it's simply not worth the loot. A helmet, class item or most likely double sniper drop.
---
I'm getting dropped from every second IB game I join atm. Must be something wrong with the servers.
---
I’d be scared to fight this guy in iron banner
---
Can anyone tell me why is rapid hit/kill clip not considered godroll? Its way better for crucible than outlaw as you dont need precision kills, only hits. And hits mean 1 hit for hand cannon. Plus extra stats. It seems like superior perk to me. Got my rapid hit/kill clip duke and that thing is insane. Fast reload anytime you hit one head. Better stability and killclip makes you two tap guardians.

You can't prove that you weren't worst then him. :/

i did that couple of time.. i got 15.. got a blockers just about i reach the bank and invader came in while the portal is up.. welp.. go kill people without having 15 flying over my head or be killed and lost all the motes..
---
safe to say i manage to take 3 down worth of 30 motes and survived
---
the grey hornet. it was only available during solstice event in year 1 season 3. it hasn't been available since then.
---
That is truly horrifying
---
The perks seem too limited. The in air accuracy buff should be inherent not on a timer. The hunter takes basically no penalty for being in the air. But the class that is tied to aerial combat has the worst possible in air accuracy
---
You need to complete the triumph for the Harbinger title so it's well worth the 10 minutes it takes
---
the grey hornet. it was available during year 1 season 3 solstice. hasn't been available since then
---
apparently there is.. invade with 15 motes.. get a kill and survive

I used it to get my “arsenal of tricks” bounty done last iron banner.

I managed to hit a five piece with it once, and got multiple double/triple kills.

It’s a truly ridiculous setup but it’ll be gone at the end of the season so I’ll enjoy it while I can.

I didn't know what planet you're on where you get an exotic or two a day, but that isn't how that works. You must have really good luck, or be lying

I need you in the crucible Guardian!
---
yes it works and you dont need any of the DLC they are just for Story and raids all the stuff you buy at the store will work and if dont just ask Bungie if they refund it
---
Possible yes - but it will be tough. It really depends on the number of hours you can spend. 
---
The process would be to do all powerful gear challenges and do all bounties along with it. 
---
Moon bounties give the most exp at the moment.

My psn is SirZambie if you want to add me.

How much cost a season pass?
---
On bottom tree you can littleraly do nothing about that
---
Exactly! And people still defend it.. The biggest issue is the undying title.. Too Grindy for a temporary title.
---
That looks great! Good job!
---
Do not trust this words
---
fucking weebs
---
What a great piece of S\*$% you are.  Autistic is no take fun of it.
---
I miss the excessive TBag
---
Bad juju is an easy one, just need to make sure you have enough resources for tributes
---
Oh please, anything can be a joke and made fun of. And if you're triggered by it, lmao have fun losing a few years if your life, brought that on yourself :)
---
Exactly the same as me. My decision is whether I invest the time now.
---
Thanks :)
---
how‘d you cancel the last word animation after using the melee?
---
Ah sorry me and all my friends are in North America (not sure what GMT) but I think the time difference would be too much.
---
A taken shader would be cool
---
There will be no other download. If you have Destiny 2 on your console and it is up to date. It alreadt has shadowkeep and forsaken installed. You just cannot access them until you buy them. If you buy shadowkeep it will probably download 10-20 megabytes for the unlock and that will be it.
---
You can temporarily get this look, using a tincture of queensfoil while wearing reverie dawn gear
---
Game is f2p so you shouldn't get a new copy of the game
---
That's just the dlc, it'll just unlock the stuff you don't have access to. No extra downloads
---
Keep going. Matchmaking tries to balance teams, not players. It seems to be more of an a average of team skill not individual players.  When I play with my clan i get wrecked. When i join solo I do great.
---
As a titan main I just chew on the cord.... that's gets the job done
---
Not possible Eskimos practically invented contractions and possessive pronouns
---
I've been using I Am Alive. Is PoTG a better option?
---
Is your cord made out if crayon? :O
---
Wonder if he is aware the helmet is zero
---
Really loving code of the missle, really fun to play but neeeeeed buff!
---
Someone else noticed that they killed ballistic slam? Now aiming your slam is more difficult... or is me?
---
Doubled it with a friend recently, 965 and 970, bottom tree nightstalker for constant invis in case of need + increased reaload speed for Izanagi and a middle tree stormcaller to quickly burst down groups of Knights. Spent two hours on it though. It was Scarlet Keep. Approximately an hour to steadily but slowly reach the boss, and then the wipes started.
---
So do I get what I’ve showed in the pic or no?
---
I did it solo because I'm a fucking masochist
---
Only dailies count , so 5 days of bounties unless you saved any.
---
I don’t care much who takes credit, I do care when this guy comes around taking the credit and getting a silver. If anything u/saint-616 deserves the silver
---
r/THE_PACK
---
I hate fusions in pvp, but it's whatever. I find most users have no gun skills.
---
It's skill based match making, sooo.... if you just started out, you will have to work your way up thtough the potatoes...
---
They have like 4 frames before they drop.
---
#1 bring a lot of glimmer (spider will usually sell some to you if you're hurting)
---
#2 progress the shadowkeep campaign to the point where it asks for you to do bounties
---
#3 grab as many bounties as you can repeatable or daily doesn't matter
---
#4 hit up a lost sector that is fairly close by
---
Now I'm not 100% on this but with the 5 repeatable bounties that you can continue to pick up you should be netting 29k with a guiding light shell for your ghost. The lost sector with the boosts may grant 3-5k XP per run.
---
Bring one weapon from each type and you'll be good
---
(With the boosts and stuff you could get 1-3 levels per lost sector and bounty run)
---
Looks nice but wouldn’t you get tired  by getting shot at all the time.
---
Thank you for the format
---
Why do people barely shoot the goddamn primeval. After three infamy resets.. I've only ever seen primeval damage under 20% most of the time from my team. Also why do they pop super at slayer x1 and x2?? I'm no genius at pve, but I at least know when to do the dps, and I should NOT be doing over 50% of the damage. It's a team activity. I should not be getting 50% of the damage or more just by shooting a few grenade launcher/izanagi shots.
---
If you have a buddy that also has the pass have him or her jump in your Fireteam, you'll both get a boost if you get to a point in progression. Or just start jumping into random Fireteams and hope
---
Thats the point of IB though. I honestly enjoy it a lot and I'm just sorry I don't have as much time to play it right now :| 
---
For No-Level advantages, Crucible is still there ( Yes I know, "exclusive" rewards etc etc ; It's still doable when your team doesn't consist of completely headless chickens )
---
It is silver. It literally does next to nothing.
---
I think he knows, his main character is a hunter, told me his titan was a “i dont care about my titan” character. I met him in a manergery(however it is spelt)
---
Worst part of missing a celestial shot is the whole fireteam knows because two orbs didn't pop from you. Personally I like calling my friend that doesn't play Hunter often out on his nighthawk misses.
---
To be honest, and hope this won't get heaps of hate... i would consistently do bad, and lose matches to get matched with bad players to get easier and more kills which is 3 out of 4 bounties... i see others not capping consistently and get the idea their going for the same thing..
---
Took me 30 matches to complete all 4 bounties and did not run into one 6 stack. Most I saw was 3
---
Ye boi, keep on imagining. And keep the salt to yourself. I'm just trying to have fun here lol.
---
Go on the lfg discord
---
I swear that if the cabal stop shooting us and just started pod-dropping us instead, they would've won the red war.
---
Nobody expects the Black Cabal Pod like nobody expects the [Spanish Inquisition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAn7baRbhx4)
---
Lots of other things if you have skill but if you prefer to eat crayons that's all you'll ever need.
---
Solid my way to 5500 using theon and mindbenders 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
As will the arcing electricity, and it procs fairly often in Crucible. Should be fine.
---
Yup.. Welcome to Bungie with no sugar daddy (Activision)
---
Imagine getting so butthurt you make a Reddit post about this lmao
---
Ok
---
Btw how does one get the Recluse?
---
Thanks
---
Yeah GG doesn’t need resistance. Cross map range, semi auto, insta kill gun. You can literally pop your head out for half a second, get a kill, and dip back into cover. 
---
Every other super gets damage resist because every other super actually requires you to be in the action to get use out of it
---

---
Ouch... I pray for you. Currently on my 22nd blast furnace trying to get Rasmussen, Steady Rounds, Feeding Frenzy, and Kill Clip. Stability, range, or handling masterwork. Maybe try 23 will bring me luck.
---
Well i got a nice set up warlock and im having tons of fun but when stuff get real i switch to JOTUN nechan!
---
Edit: well actually im running JOTUN nechan 80% of the time. Things in IB is brutal. SO adapt
---
OH sorry. My connection is shit here and I probably submitted it to many times
---
They should have added a cabal drop pod mask for Festival of the lost. It would be like a mini one came and smashed your head.
---
nice
---
“OOOOOHHHH!”
---
Welcome to the “I have the easiest title in the game” club
---
Well get it then you crybaby instead of complaining all the time
---
No, it's to keep the blood off our face from everything we punch, so we can punch more.
---
Every time I go after the high value target
---
Most definitely, all raids except for Garden are 750 light
---
I think you will still need to acquire some  after they get unlocked.
---
Warlocks are possibly the most versatile class in pve right now.
---
Eater of worlds is much easier than scourge. Scourge is a better and more fun raid tho
---
Reach 2100 Glory in competitive, or Fabled rank. I forget the second step but it's not very hard, neither is 2100 Glory. Time consuming maybe but still very achievable, you lose barely any Glory for a loss below 2100 and you can gain a few hundred per win.
---
i haven’t actually tried wishender in pvp but i used it for months in pve such a good bow
---
Zen moment is one of the only perks ill actively seek in my rolls. With high recoil weapons like aggressive 360rpm autos theres such a difference in recoil and my aim once i hit those first few shots.
---
I have done 40 Izanagi forges and 40 Bergusia for that gun, got that shitty roll twice now xD All I wanted is that roll you mentioned, killclip/feeding frenzy and a good MW. But I have up a few months ago.
---
Stadia is worse than that
---
I saw Byf last night in the tower, that lore juice gave me the strength to play Survival.
---
Bc snipers aren’t already busted enough lmao
---
Live your life instead of obsessing over meaningless videogame bullshit?
---
When you try to justify this you only make yourself out to be a fucking fool
---
Bungie already showed that they plan the next 5 years already, nothing changed about D3 not coming any time soon.
---
My bet is that they go with yearly expansions, together with year-long season pass content like we have now. So basically one expansion and 4 passes each year. There's also a "collection" with shadowkeep+forsaken coming down the line, which is currently available for Stadia.
---
Ok, so grind crucible basically
---
But Scorched Teams though.
---
Yes man, i like that place!
---
Thanks! I’ll keep at it! Haha
---
What platform are you on?
---
I am a fusion rifle user and I like to feel I have very good gun skill with other guns
---
How do they put the icons on there
---
Well yea, you cant do what would make logical sense for these beings because it's a bad story then. There are plenty of reasons humans wouldnt nuke each other. None of which would apply to a super advanced robotic race with no emotions. They could easily wipe a solar system off the map, but this is a video game, and we need robots with crit spots that we can shoot.
---
The missions change locations (there are some Warmind missions on other planets besides Mars) so I'd say check your Navigator. If they're not there, check with Holliday and see if you abandoned the campaign on accident.
---
We just gon ignore that he posted it to a bunch of different subs aswell?

But threat detector on pluperfect? If it were for a gun with more rpm and I could do the occasional hip fire spray but not on this 360rpm.

Which brings me to my next question. If I have to chose between a gun with 2 mediocre perks and one with one good and one trash. What should I pick? Guess we can't say it generally, can we?

You can farm austringer (hand cannon) beloved (sniper) and erintil (fusion) from menagerie. You can get claws of the wolf(pulse) from iron banner. These are all decent pvp weapons. Figure out what your best pvp  kinetic exotic is then farm for the other slot. Check youtube for how to farm these and best rolls. I swear by Claws but I I've been stuck in the 1700s this season. Good luck.
---
Oh thanks
---
There is a visual activation on the hand cannon when you aim it. Watch for it, then shoot.
---
New Light Player here. I’ve completed most of the raids (excluding GoS), got all pinnacle weapons, reached 950 (966 if including seasonal artifacts) and have almost 2 titles completed (cursebreaker and dredgen)
---
I have all iron banner weapons, I dont mind the claws but yeah I dont have a god roll. And honestly have never tried menagerie maybe I will do that.. I heard you can somehow get a range MW dust rock blues from that guaranteed if you have the right runes in the chalice?
---
What i did is I would just collect bounties like crucible, vanguard, or moon ones and do them everyday and then log off, you can buy the extra bounties for 3k glimmer. The XP you get adds up pretty quickly
---
What do you mean ugly this beautiful
---
If you like Fusions then the year 1 elatha or erentil are still A grade. Can just be pulled from collections. 
---
If not, and has to be a shotgun, then 
---
https://binged.it/35M71ef
---
Farm duskrock blues from menagerie. Its wealth rune, wealth rune and then any green rune for range.
---
(mindbender user here) you wouldn't believe how useful a shotgun is just for defending yourself from other shotgunners, i'm actively seeking primary gunfights but if some ape wants to push you it's a great counter to just have your own shotgun. you don't have to hold W with it
---
Solid misuse of the meme there, my guy. See you in the crucible.
---
Yeah it’s tough to grapple with if you have New Light. The veterans had campaign mission markers to guide us through, quests from tower vendors to get us into the activities. 
---
If you go see Amanda again you’ll get the option to play Warmind, it’s a fun, three to four hour story and it’ll give you access to some exotic quests for weapons, and give you the chance to complete Escalation Protocol on Mars for some great loot there ([A little guide here](https://d2.destinygamewiki.com/wiki/Escalation_Protocol))
---
It wasn’t a fun day in the Munki household watching Cayde die. I had to take a little break if I’m honest
---
it’s the only counter to shotgun rushing. also judging by the opponent’s health bar, you were significantly below their power, so you took less bolts to kill
---
Dude looks dope. Very different. I wouldn’t say ugly haha
---
(Make this into an original meme)
---
“Let’s go to prison!”
---
“I suggest the action of inprisoning myself and my single comrade”
---
“I, cayde-6, request that we incarcerate ourselves  in a maximum security fortification created with the intent to hold captured beings accused of crime”
---
No. No nerf needed. With the right roll, any fusion rifle can do this.
---
I hit 5500 in case you were wondering
---
Yes but....
---
They can't drop any new gear, and should be locked to the old power cap.
---
They can drop old gear with new shaders though.
---
Ok boomer.
---
i thought it was 5 seconds late?
---
Yes, but the rewards are capped and sometimes prevents powerfuls from crucible and Gambit ranks.
---
You need to do the activities with a gold circle beside them on the destination map. Completing those rewards higher level gear.
---
I do actually, almost all of my quests that are left require me to do some party missions xD. Add me if you can, my steam ID is "I Bet u shower naked, u slut". Not a joke, I am serious.
---
No, it was two minutes. I was watching the stream.
---
It's a bug 8)
---
I think warlocks are the best in pvp the nova bomb super 1 shots then has babies that kill you and sunbreaker whatever it is comes at you fast so u keep running and devour+entril or whatever that gun is one shots and there’s a lot more
---
A +40 PL difference is pretty bad. I know you can boost your Resilience, but they will get you pretty quickly.
---
IB requires both effort and time. If you want to grind it out, the gear will boost your PL. Until you hit 950, dont invest too much into lower gear. Keep swapping for higher Light until you peak.
---
Thank you for that! I actually did pull the Erentil from my collection cause so many were using it in IB. I just dont really have great exotic kinetics. A few that come to mind are crimson , mida . And service revolver is my only decent hand cannon for pvp
---
You don't even need to aim with the damn thing

My class is usually slows bomb. And as for trash, I mean I was top teaming last night in IB and my max light is like 913.

D1 habit, I can understand.
---
Maybe it could be a thing where the regeneration starts on a kill and then damage you deal feeds into the regeneration and something like 200-400 damage would give a bullet.
---
Why did bungie take away the defense rating on the masks 
---
WHYYY
---
Found the guy that plays games for the graphics
---
I'm already done . It's not possible. I keep getting matched up against people using lunas howl. Like why the fuck play this game mode if you already have the weapons? Ruining it for others
---
I didn't notice any. Was running spoiler alert. Their in air accuracy is absolutely higher than the other 2 classes.
---
are you being serious lol
---
ANY QUESTIONS????
---
Punches don't always register even if it does the lung animation. This issue has always plagued every melee-based ability ever since destiny 1 (swords, supers, etc.) 
---
It's likely that one of them just whiffed
---
EDIT: it's also possible that they had an overshield from One eyed mask
---
HHSN Followed up with a melee kills spectral blades. Blink is amazing for being mobile and staying out of sightlines, not to mention its super hard to read.
---
What Google (and these other streaming services) are doing is amazing. It works really well.
---
I'm not gonna hate on it (and the technology) just cause it's cool to hate on it.
---
It’s a time based thing cuz it’s a DEFEAT not kill. I’m not sure the exact time you have but I think if you damage it once, it has to be defeated within 3 seconds or else it won’t count as a defeat but that shouldn’t be a problem if you’re constantly doing damage to it.
---
Ah a man of culture
---
I'm talking about the images.
---
Good for you😃
---
On mid tree arcstrider you could launch a wave of arc across the ground when you slide then melee.
---
now go try it with 18 mobility :P Those where some of the fastest deaths i have ever had. 
---
Still fun though.
---
If you mean class, they all have benefits and drawbacks. If you end up loving D2 you should make one of each as you get the most rewards and fastest progression that way. My first was a Warlock, and it’s still my main class.
---
Kinda. If you’re going to chase a trend, you might as well do it right. You can’t even look like a mando with d2 armor. There’s no similarity.
---
Well you are wrong. That's a meme, inserting different image to express the same idea doesn't make it not a meme...
---
That's what I thought the second I saw this lol
---
Also. You play hunter. Which is easily the best class in the game. And by no means difficult to master. But u complain that dawnblade "moves too fast" or "handheld supernova one shot me" and then wanna tell me I am trash. Hunter is the most played class simply bc they are easier to do well with than the other 2.
---
Element type. Can be with an arc gun (second or third weapon slot) - it's a blue symbol at the top of the gin. 
---
Can also be by using arc (blue) super &amp; abilities
---
I would like to point out that console players are locked at 60fps, hardly playable is a bit of a stretch.
---
I remember the first time I found the mask. It was powerful in pve. Then I went into pvp, and it was one of the biggest mistakes I’ve ever made in my guardian’s lifetime. After only 4 matches I took it off and never put it on again.
---
PlayStation player here. I spam square all the time I catch myself doing it most of the time in crucible

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme
---
Titan hunter or warlock
---
That simply isn't true, I play pvp on all classes religiously. From hundreds of hours playing all 3 I know that for a fact, in air accuracy has been shadow buffed several times over year two. IamCoolGuy on YouTube has a video explaining this. And lastly sidearms, smgs, shotguns, 180 HCs, and auto rifles have superior in air accuracy by nature.
---
Sorry I mean guardians when I wrote it I couldn’t think of the word
---
It comes down to what playstyle you prefer, titans shine in close combat and melee, hunters are more subtile with invisibility options and gunslinger gameplay and warlocks (especially solar subclass) are the closest to a support class. All are viable on their own. Titans are popular in PvP, warlocks tend to be a bit more popular in PvE. If you are new to the game you could try Hunter, they are the closest to what the gameplay (gunplay, movement) and the aesthetics in this game are about, they kinda are *the destiny class*
---
Maybe because people enjoy fun? No need to be a jackass.
---
Oh, class.
---
They are all equally good. Titan has an advantage in PvP because of some of the gear you can earn but in PvE (Most of the game) they are well balanced.
---
There's your PC masterrace for ya
---
They were ~10 power levels higher than you.  That range is viable for a kill with fewer bolts connecting and damage falloff when the target had less health or when the attacker has a damage bonus.
---
Your positioning was wrong considering your weapon (sniper) the map (this is the least safe firing lane for long range) and the objective status (you had two zones).  If the enemy team has fusion rifles and you rush a lane to their only remaining zone then you deserve the voop.
---
High impact fusion rifles can rightly kill at longer ranges due to their high charge time--which is greater than the ttk of most weapons.  If they precharge in cover and predict your movements from radar/common sense then good on them.
---
Erentil rightly has higher range and zoom to compensate for low base stability and terrible handling--both of which are needed to keep bolts together and to ADS for intrinsic stationary accuracy boost.  
---
They had bonus damage for more power and you were standing still in the defenders firing lane when the shot went off.  So good for them!
---
Cross the beams!
---
Well, nothing like the good old ways !
---
Thanks, I really hope it doesn't work that way, specifically left those for last thinking could do them next season if came to it, due to no text stating had to be done this season. :/

Heroic public events require a little extra, and they're each different. For instance in the prisoner pod on the tangled shore, you can't just kill him outright. You need to wait for the ground to be electrified and if you look near the bottom of the pod, you'll see 2-4 jets of steam coming out of circular parts. Shoot these open to reveal pickups that when 2(?) are thrown at him, he'll freeze solid. Then you have to guard your bounty, another timed phase that is the Heroic part of the event.

Still quite high for the majority of people. Pay attention when you snap to targets. If you find your crosshair is going past where you want it to be, it’s too fast for you.

You want to aim to be able to do a 180 degree turn with a full sweep from one side of your mouse mat to the other.

How does light level effect damage/defense? I'm a new light player and the stickied guide doesn't really go into depth on what exactly light level means in pvp.

Too easy lmao

Sweet flip dude. A 1080 corkscrew lemon twist. Damn respect.
---
Ive uninstalled and reinstalled latest drivers, everything is up to date
---
Specs: 
---
I dont know exact specs of motherboard but
---
⦁ GTX 1080 TI Founders Edition  
---
⦁ Intel Core i7-4790K  
---
⦁ 16 GB DDR4  
---
⦁ Samsung 850 Evo 500GB  
---
⦁ Hitachi HDS724040ALE640 4TB
---
all of my primary games are on a ssd and i dont run anything above medium because i perfer fps over grapics
---
As of Shadowkeep, Forsaken includes the Y2 annual pass content. There shouldn't be an issue for new/returning players starting those quests. =\]
---
As a previous titan who used OEM and bottom tree Striker, I'm confused as to why when I switched to maining my warlock I'm still carrying my teams. I expected all of my skill to evaporate with the loss of the "automatic game winners".
---
I agree.  I see a lot of hate for Auto Rifles on here for PvP.  I used a master worked Hazard of the Cast for a while, but now I use the Breakneck. As long as it isn’t close quarters you should be able to get 25+ kills in a control match.  Also a great substitute for The Recluse is a Hero’s Burdens master worked.  I actually like it better.
---
Sweet! Thank you(:
---
Yes it's just typed words but the context with which those words are used is what's important. Telling people to "grow the fuck up" rather than explaining reasoning looks hyper aggressive and combative and certainly doesn't help the point you're trying to make. 
---
You know?
---
It's like the Goomba in the first level of Mario... 
---
They have probably killed more players then any boss in the respective game haha
---
But should I pick up the dlc? If so what ones
---
Ps totally awesome catalyst 9 shots and auto loading holster such an interesting gun to use
---
Honestly this would be awesome
---
Your Titan makes me want to blow my brains out lmao #huntermasterrace
---
thanks!
---
So another crutch for hunter? Yay
---
Transmat fiririririririririiiiiiiiiing.
---
Yeah I'll need to run it a few times first I think because I dont have any runes unlocked. But thank you!!
---
He’s just more efficient lol
---
I'm on PS4
---
You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like
---
ON YOUR KNEES!!
---
I also play on low and i only get 40 fps holy moly theres something wrong here
---
Broooooo, we get it you hate supers because you use them as an excuse for a horrible KD... leave the guy aloneeeee
---
LOL
---
As soon as I see those I pop out my jouten.... shit on those kids from across the map.
---
I like the couple seconds of oh what is going on leading to that final pause of, well this is fucked I might as well just clip it
---
It’s pronounced ddosing
---
I've been wanting some better solar effects and that one would certainly fit the bill
---
Wait a week unless you have a second/third character to run it with.
---
What gun is that?
---
What he says right before that is.
---
We need the full rolls
---
How much did google pay you? Is it per post or per day?
---
They haven't done that with any of the other seasons so I doubt they'll start now.
---
Need full rolls
---
So you are familiar with the noise then?
---
Ya nailed it.
---
Ah dam didn’t realize yes they all have spike bar maul
---
Or 6 stack quitting
---
Another? Also it’s not just for hunters
---
We need full rolls. However, I don't think that Orewing's could be comparable since it's a special breech loaded GL
---
I’m just happy they’re bringing back gunslingers trance.
---
Yall really do be sleeping on eternal warrior though
---
It’s the great pumpkin Charlie Brown
---
*Xenophage
---
*I paid for it so i want everything handed to me straight away*
---
...
---
I thought this was a sterile alien from Mass effect at first
---
You talking to the community who allow and BOUGHT a anual pass and a expansión like nothing
---
Apologies I thought it had them on there 
---
Maul threat detector and demo
---
Swam spike rampage and snapshot
---
Love and death spike and full court moving target
---
If it’s the bergusia forge there is a separate sort of mini quest line to do involving the black armory key mold you should have from ada
---
Ok so basically it's just people blaming weapons for losing when it's not the gun they lost to, I've watched a good portion of awesome gear ruined over the years of playing this game, because people harangue bungie about them instead of accepting some loses as learning experiences and ignorantly blaming the weapons. Personally I record every loss and look for why I died mostly it's because I was team shot by a second guy I didnt notice at the time. I have moments where I hate certain guns with a passion but I never claim that a gun nerf is going to fix anything about the stagnant state of destiny crucible. And about the only nerf I can appreciate is the OEM overshield.and I play all 3
---
Just gotta learn how to cheese some of these things man. I just finished my Undying yesterday; you gotta take advantage of the resources and shortcuts Bungie provides. Use Momentum Control for the Scout kills for Randy’s, empty Sword kills for the subclass-specific Melee kills on the Moon, the ridiculously forgiving Glory scoring in Survival, and so on. 
---
Also make sure to do your research. A variety of people dedicate their professional and recreational lives to putting info out there to help other Guardians progress through the game more efficiently, or to helping others get over whatever particular hump is in their way.
---
Paid exotic quest??? Where?
---
This aint part of shadowkeep or forsaken.
---
lol fair.
---
Honestly, man, I have no idea, I'm thinking of deleting the post...
---
huh same card as mine. hmmmmm.
---
Lol that me in crucible.
---
Rolls
---
 I've never had a problem with golden gun, just don't peek them. The outlaw super doesn't last very long.
---
Orale.
---
Esta cabron
---
Yeah, the gravity thing irks me as well. All the oxygen stuff I can ignore what with terraforming and other space magics. But the fact that I can jump just as high on the moon as on Earth gets to me.
---
You got all up in his personal space, &amp; he didn't like it
---
Don’t forget to equip a +10% xp ghost shell
---
He's wearing Skullfort, so probably top or middle tree.

MeinKampf
---
Every team I play against apparently realizes this unfortunately.
---
Had this happen to me in a raid
---
Power ammo is the only time in competitive where I don't get OHKO after one kill, cause lol, thuderlord is a machine gun that's also a sniper, xd. That or huckleberry/ shotgun rush, which I don't do anymore, cause shotguns are too op and cheesy.
---
I'm at 40% scout kills and 42% medals with like 11 days left. I'm not sure I have it in me to grind as hard as I'm gonna need to.
---
The misfit is great in pve

Tickle fingers in D2 is the worst, most buggy and inconsistent thing I've used in the entire game, especially compared to D1's version .
---
1) activating it mid jump will stall your velocity, cause you to sink once the animation is done, and negate your ability to jump until you land.
---
2) you can't use it while in using glide - if you do, it either cancels glide causing you to sink, or does worknt at all, or makes half the animation, cancels and does no damage wasting a precious 3-5 seconds of the already limited super and probably getting you killed in PvP in the process.
---
3) you can't sprint. And the baseline running/floating around seems incredibly slow, atleast compared to D1.
---
4) from what Is a slow moving, mobility limited, close range only super, I can't see why it doesn't have damage resistance like the flying, rocket launching, sometimes homing sunbreakers and dawn blades.
---
5) the TTK with it is so inconsistent. Sometimes it does 2 ticks of damage in about. 5 seconds almost insta killing someone, and other times the animation is making a connection to the person but damage isn't being done to them as they fly over your head or around you barely on the edge of your range even though the animation and sound is being made.
---
6) the area of effect is definitely smaller than D1 in both radius range, angular degrees of effect in front of you, and in height above/over you.
---
I used to main storm caller in D1 and would typically do 5-6 flawless 9-0 trials runs per weekend. ( one on each character for myself then 3-4 extra on my warlock to carry people) and let me tell you storm caller FEELS terrible, buggy, inconsistent, buggy, and sometimes absolutely not worth using over say a shotgun: in the slow ass time for me to walk over to someone without my burst glide or sprint and hit someone with 2-4 ticks of SUPER damage mind you. I could sprint, slide burst glide and insta kill someone with a shorty and move on to the next target before the activation animation for storm caller is done. Even people like mtashed have said that storm caller feels horrible in D2, and I'm not saying this as if his opinion is law, but rather I mention this to demonstrate that I'm not alone in thinking this. I'm not saying the D1 storm caller was balanced or that D1 is better than D2, but the storm caller in D2 feels truly broken (as in unfunctional, not broken="overpowered").
---
But what if both the moon AND the sun are orbiting around the earth every 15 minutes? The results would look the same.
---
After I play cod for a while I try to tac sprint so much lol
---
That’s assuming that our ship stays in exactly the same spot.
---
thanksgiving was last month
---
After that title, I expected a flop.
---
I'm running snapshot with moving target and I love this thing.
---
You and me both! It's like I enjoy being punished.
---
I'm sure bungie has a reason but who knows. Even the forge polymer and the item for the pit can be used any time and will stay till you do said activity.
---
They're evolving
---
Xbox why
---
*Tries to withdrawal 1 Telesto*
---
“Your account balance is: 1 Duke.44”
---
Yeah, I enjoy using it. But I was wondering about a Kinetic legendary auto rifle
---
I'd use the 100% more if I actually remembered. I like to use them in iron banner and wish more people would. Same for strikes always remember when the strike is over rip
---
My cousins were joining yesterday, one of them being 903 &amp; saying _"let's see how bad it is, I don't wanna keep playing if it sucks"_
---
he got a few 1.0+ka/ds &amp; I'm still unsure how, but he kept playing
---
What was the break nerf???
---
Meme Beam reigns supreme.
---
I spam E. Its just became a motor reflex now. I do it without knowing. It is sometimes can be considered as bad habit like in the last event where it sends you to the start if you respawn.
---
eh...
---
Yes man, if you are struggling with csgo on medium on that build, something might be wrong.
---
That's basically how I wound up with this, the Iron Banner symbol on the tailgate, the Hunter symbol I made my buddy..... I have a random thought and BOOM half hour later it's a sticker or a shirt.
---
My face when the format creator said the format was free to use and everyone starts throwing stones when people actually use it.
---
This has been over posted but I'll say this now. If bungie doesn't find a way to stop hackers on PC trials will be a joke. Maybe require the current season or something so f2p can't access it. But that's a risky option given the current standing of the game and community.
---
Your dad is incredible. Don't think I don't see that Pride emblem. &lt;3
---
It is said that in the end, when light and darkness have consumed everything and each other, 2 titans will remain, endlessly punching each other in pure bliss.
---
Apparently they did something to it so that the Onslaught perk that sped up the rate of fire the more you stacked Rampage makes it do less damage now.
---
Well, I’m just saying, get an OEM if you really want to piss the Jeep off
---
Welp. That's dumb as shit.
---
Is this Gambit?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Never done it, and was worried it was more PvP team vs team...but this looks like a blast!
---
Damn dude you totally made me remember I can make my own Hunter symbol. Thanks so much! Haven’t touched my cricket in years, haha.
---
Is there a gay cousin option 😂
---
I'm not your bro.
---
😂
---
New Light? Thats my face and I'm a 5 year veteran
---
Try the Annex in the tower
---
Agreed. That was my favorite gun I used on my Titan.
---
It's David S. Pumpkins.. any questions? 😁
---
Happy Thanksgiving, Guardian! Have a great day playing Destiny :)
---
 What about the saladman
---
I was a pretty big fan of the ar, that does explain why I've felt less overall damage from it.
---
*switches to controversies hold voidwalker* “why am I still doing so good?”
---
As an invader?
---
Happy thanksgiving! If I jump on later I’ll hit you up!
---
Yeah my poor 970 has had some encounters with D2 aswell
---
Cool deal!
---
wdym?
---
Carry on Guardian.
---
The ollllll dick punch!
---
Sprinting? You're meant to fly. Also it blinks, I can consistantly kill entire teams with it. Mtashed said it feels bad and then uses it all the time because he knows he was wrong. It sometimes is a little funky to use but to say its garbage is just straight up wrong bruh. I think you might need to improve your play
---
Or r/fireteams
---
Yes, as I invade, they scatter like cockroaches lol
---
I think the only bounty that takes the longest is the Arsenal of Tricks one. It’s ridiculously slow
