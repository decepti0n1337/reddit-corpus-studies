Who?

Mm-mmmm master witcher?
---
Gallant charge is a fusion, not a Linear Fusion, so it won’t count.
---
Neither. Fractal-ine. Pronounced same way as line, spine, done. Etc.
---
Mess with the stonks you get the bonks
---
This is the wrong place for this
---
Pretty sure it's the original crucible set for the hunter. It's called Swordflight4.1 I think.
---
sometimes...
---
Mmmmm shotty underbarrel
---
Im not saying stormcaller is bad but compared to the other subclasses its nowhere near as good.In crucible nova blink with top/middle tree or dawnblade is so much better than any arc subclass.Raids/ dungeons Well is the go to or nova.top tree.dawn blade/well is the best for nightfall.Arc subclasses arent bad but theyre outclassed by the others.Middle tree arc also isnt as good as nova top for dps and not great  in crucible or add killing so its never the best to choose
---
How much did you heal their Primeval?
---
You thought it was Saladin, but it was me, Dio
---
honestly the scoring system doesnt make sense in gambit... guardian kills dont count as much as they should in there!:) gj man keep it up (but not when youre in my enemy team pls)
---
He got every right to complain. Gambit should have a solo option, just like survival does.
---
The only good rewards from it are the pinnacle rewards from the bounties. Which can realistically be done in a day per character.
---
Why can’t the guardians in the Crucible be more like you?
---
rng
---
Those opponents are legitimately awful. Not bad, awful
---
Who? I don’t know who that is.
---
Both have no life lmao
---
That’s super cool, you did a really good job
---
 [Excuse me friend but........](https://i.imgur.com/ibByKES.jpg)

Lmao thanks dude and I totally agree but whatever, at least it has a guardian kill counter on there
---
Anime character
---
From basically naught you full health three times in total despite being in only two rounds
---
Played 2 matches then left it alone. I don’t like being blown up every 30 seconds lol
---
I got sweet business and actium war
---
rig to drop for me within a week of each other.
---
I knew what the game was trying to tell me. The trigger is still held down to this day.
---
Your network wasn’t the bottleneck. The biggest problem with the PS4 is its hard drive - buy an external SSD or replace the internal with one and you’ll see *massive* improvements.
---
Okay, so Mercy (OW) in a trace rifle. I'm down.
---
I just used grey rarity primary ammo using weapons. Why do people keep thinking that the meme is about how good the weapons are? It's about how they're primary weapons in a primary school.
---
Whats so good about Swarm? I assume you mean the GL, i got 9 in vault just incase.
---
What other generic childish responses do you know?
---
I watched a guy burn it down to the last sliver and wait (a fair bit) for someone to be running the very last orb before firing the last shot just as they reached the node.
---
I loved the gun in D1, but stopped using it when it was broken. I literally only used op lord of wolves during the last hour before it's nerf. It's fine now.
---
Salami
---
Sorry
---
Luckily Everytime I do the event everyone seems competent enough to understand what to do and we make it heroic
---
The problem is NOT getting end of match rewards or progress because the game bugs out?
---
Love Leviathan, I’ll have to pick it up.
---
Thanks for the advice. I'll git gud so the game stop bugging out on me. Wonderful advice.
---
That good boy is the sentry
---
How do you not know Edge Transit's icon? It was literally a meme for several months.
---
Terran Wind is bootleg Edge Transit.
---
Go check your collections/flair.. It should be there to reaquire if you have already purchased it
---
It might be in a "package" in your consumables. I'm not sure if they changed the inventory recently.
---
“Don’t tell the elf”
---
Despite the fact that the game is free, I’d never buy a physical copy of a game that you can only play with an internet connection.
---
All emotes are found in a selection menu on the right hand side of the screen below the armor and weapons swap screen. Just bring it up and press down
---
You do it below 750, when i put all my lowest gear on, my light level is 238, i bet that would never match me to anyone actually doing the forge.
---
What not possible Monday failing
---
The barge is there, it's not marked on the map. Like it isn't active..
---
No it doesn’t lol, everyone would be hard capped off it was every game.  It’s only when u Finnish the quests
---
On your character gear screen, press down and go to the ship/sparrow/emote/emblem screen. Go to emotes, should show there. Click on it, and assign a button.
---
It’s the Clarkson joke guys relax.
---
Would you mind sharing the stl?
---
Did you check your emotes collection? It’s on the same sunscreen as choosing sparrows and ships for your character? This got me confused about a month ago too. They’re all stored on your character permanently now. Just go to your emotes and it will be there
---
Even the pro? Regardless, thank you friendly guardian I'm going to look into a new SSD... *or just a PC*...
---
I’m talking about the blue and purple gear after every match not the actually IB gear
---
The quickest way to get something in this game is by not wanting it or thinking about it.
---
Damn.  I still haven't got one to drop!  Lol
---
I’ve finished all my IB bounties and still only have 3 RL kills. Fuck this step. Whoever decided on this step can piss up a rope.
---
I like how you don’t have a response so you’re just making shit up now lol
---
HE IS HERE!!
---
Don’t do that...don’t give me hope.
---
Sure.  [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3968878](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3968878)
---
I've never done that one before, one a scale of 1-10 (10= most difficult), how difficult is it?
---
Depends on the platform. On Xbox I spend forever in matchmaking, however on PC there’s like zero wait time on my end
---
I could say the same for you.
---
Same thing happened with me but with the Sundial. Loaded in as the boss was killed and got the triumph for completing Sundial without dying.
---
No you lost
---
Thanks!
---
I want to experience it alongside them though, and if I beat the campaign idk if I can do it again without swapping characters. I mean I guess I could just use my other characters but that would still take away from the combined experience.
---
You can do the campaign with other people if they are the fireteam leader and haven't completed it yet. But, if you really want that combined experience then wait for your buddies.
---
I rarely see it on PC. Lord of wolves is a lot bigger problem.
---
okay, what’s your gamertag? i’ll send u a screenshot of it, or multiple if you want
---
No. Warlock on hunter
---
Kinda concerning when you can name every character on the poster
---
Edit: but congrats dude
---
God I have nightmares of when the lord of wolves was in its prime
---
The addiction is real
---
Welcome Kinderguardian. Play, play, play...then play some more.
---
Kinda obsolete now, but okay. Even though the guy didn't even cover blink.
---
I don't have anyone to play with unfortunately so it's either matchmaking in strikes or just me doing missions
---
Adventures are only available on a planet when that planet is the Flashpoint. So you can only run Baron hunts when TS is the FP.
---
It came up a few weeks ago...I ran a few for a 2.0 drop of the Scorned Baron robes.
---
My erentil has 4k kills on it. Here's why I use it:
---
1. It's obviously o.p.
---
2. Some people enjoy playing the game the way they want and if you want to play that way slow roll your quest. 
---
3. For a majority of that I used rat king/last word paired with shotty or martyrs retribution. It was a super fun build, but wanna know what else if fun once in a while? Just going and slaying out with an o.p. loadout because you enjoy playing the game that way and just need a win.
---
Just wondering I've seen pc players complain about recluse but I hadn't noticed it. I also play xbox but havent noticed erentil being overly used. Not saying you're wrong just that I hadn't noticed on xbox.
---
Welcome to final quest, Iron Banner: Heavy Encampment
---
You can repeat every campaign, how many times you want. And you can join your buddies anytime in story unless in proloque.
---
Thirsts for your light
---
Sorry. I was just really salty because of this unexpected turn of events and didn't see it was you who replied to your own comment. Here's a hug to comfort you for your lost time and efforts as well.
---
Yes. I played D1 &amp; D2 year one and came back. A LOT of stuff to do, and even more exotics/lego’s to go for.
---
This is why i like gambit: you NEVER have a safe win. Scales may tip either side. Even the most skilled invader might get jotunned in the face. A reaper can die from a HVM. When the enemy has nothing and you have a primeval, that doesn't mean they can't catch up. The best strategy for gambit is never give up.
---
Unless the rolls are good and you just use an upgrade module...? Am I missing something?
---
Was a slog on my Titan and warlock.
---
On my hunter I got 9 wardcliff kills in one game.
---
Shaxx: That sacred dong I need
---
thats the point my g
---
At least 200
---
Fucking amazing
---
Imgur apparently just marks everything NSFW. Even on their main page I'll see a pic of like, a text screenshot. And then I click on it and it tells me to confirm my age. It's dumb.
---
Just wait until you get a max range firmly planted roll. Think yours maps? Mine will consitently kill at pulse range, no matter how much ammo I have in the mag.
---
STL ?
---
Then the real question is why are you still here slithering around desperately in subreddits of games you don’t even play. What a sad lonely man
---
Storm caller has an activation attack. he activated his super, you hit him, landfall killed you. he tanked it because of super damage resistance.
---
It comes from the sundial or the timelost bounties at the tangled shore obelisk. Nothing else drops it. If you can't do the timelost bounties at the obelisk, then no, you can't get it.
---
I knew it was good but 71 METERS!?
---
Three opponents down!
---
I know there's a record for I think 151 meters? My friend had his kill me in testing at 104 meters.
---
Wow you’re a douchefuck
---
It’s no worse than being a sniper main. I use it because I want Komodo and it uses energy ammo. Fun little rifle for challenging enemies
---
at which point you cant unlock the hunter or warlock armor....
---
If im not wrong spectral has more resistance. Looks like his cast just deals tons of dmg...
---
He’s a dipfuck bitch
---
I’d go out in that blaze of glory. Finally revenge for screebs and cursed thralls
---
ε&gt; nevermind got it
---
Ohh, yeah he does.
---
Thanks for the advice! I haven't really played IB at all but I'll try to jump in!
---
I also want a "what? You're approaching me?!" Emote
---
Be prepared to die a lot because there is light advantage in IB so high light people will do more damage to you
---
That is really cool. Nice job man.
---
I have a god rolled Wiz Rebuke and Ive gotten a few messages about how sweaty I am.
---
I seriously agree with this. I see so much feedback that is opposite of other feedback, it must be a headache to pull out the relevant bits.
---
what if we are doing the cheese method will the room still matter because she starts wiping before we can even do anything like shooting her eyes
---
Then you’re in the wrong room.
---
ok
---
Yes it does. You need to be in the blue Room, but if she shows up immediately, you have to back out and make your way down.
---
I miss having a decent connection game over a laggy sweat fest everyday
---
Would fighting lion work? I have orewings but no colony
---
Polar Vortex is one of the Event exotic sparrows
---
I've given Zavala some many Gjallardoodles, definitely got diabeetus.
---
yea but it stays despite restarting the game and all that
---
Masterworking armor with seasonal mod slots is mentally ill, and/or a newbie mistake which leads to heartbreak and despair the moment he finds out all my grinding was for nothing.
---

I don’t know you but I’m glad we two strangers have the chance to bond over this shared hatred.

The opposing pvp team is a pre made fireteam with people who are actively communicating because they know each other in some way, like through discord.
---
Im more of an icarus grip kinda guy
---
It sounds dumb when you put it like that. I see it as people wanting freedom. I take issue with the champion mods dictating what weapon types I use, when I think the mods should be applicable to all weapon types (certain attributes like anti-barrier should only apply to weapon types that are fitting, of course), and I think Exotics need to be included so that they don't get left out. And there's been common complaints about the new armor system being restrictive and too RNG heavy, and finally, there's been complaints recently about bounties being the main focus if you want to level up the season pass.
---
All those things have one thing in common- they limit your freedom and don't let you play the way you want, which is something Bungie touted pre-shadowkeep. So I think the complaints are credible. I don't like using the same loadout forever. I like to change it up plenty. But I don't like the champion mods dictating what I have to use for certain activities. I don't like the fact that unless I get really lucky, only armor from certain sources rolls with high stats, and the rolls/affinity can't be altered in any way.  
---
Anyway I just wanted to say that there's some valid complaints about the current state of Destiny and it goes deeper than the meme
---
Oh my god, mods need to add “Dredgen Yo’re” as a user flair.

Hand over that thing! Your monte carlo!

So? That’s still absolutely absurd.
---
Holy Moly, which tree were you running?
---
What? Is this fake or actually real?
---
You haven’t been to Chapo then have you...
---
The madlad did it
---
That’s why u run Dungeon, nightfall ordeal, nightmare hunt and raid first, filling lower slots in between with powerful gear.
---
Even then if u get pinnacle weapons on one char, log onto the other char and get the dungeon first it next pinnacle weapons will be higher. That’s how I did my pinnacles and I wanted to get weapons from iron banner with my titan first, did all other things, logged onto my hunter repeated the process and then did my warlock with running everything else first, completing the quest and then cashing the bounties in. Now I am only missing my gloves on 970.
---
So plan ahead next time
---
I'm with you on all your points 100%. If everyone stopped being so negative and condescending for the quest and just pushed through it, got it done, it would be done. It's like in school; u hate a subject but you got a test coming up. U still do the homework required to pass for the test. This is ur test guys. Just do it.
---
But still

It's so sad that I even have to do this...

You're a new Light... I get it... but i have 5000 hours in this freakin' game (not that you need that to now the first 30 minutes of the game) and also: "Destiny 2: Story Mission 1"

They removed the intro quests when New Light dropped. Now all the forges are in a playlist on the EDZ Director, they rotate daily.

---
Wouldn't it be 71? Or does traction add stats?
---
I'd be more scared if it was the sniper version of those drones and they had izanagi's burden.
---
Those fucking sniper drones have killed me so many times in the forge its not even funny.
---
Thank you!
---
Yup, me.
---
You know, so you don't have to reload your sword.
---
Endgame is a real issue imo. Its just horde mode after horde mode. Menagerie was fun though, but its just doing raids, thats the endgame. Im someone with social anxiety and mostly play solo (even tho i got rivensbane somehow) but its just i dont like raiding every evening. And playing sundial every time isnt gonna cut it. For me destiny is still missing an endgame mode where you can just casually play in. Something like strikes but more then that.
---
I want one that would freeze adds and then explode them
---
I Love All Those Memories From D1. I Plan On Getting The Others Done Going Down The Same Arm
---
Go to the entrance of Leviathon and get the enemies down to a certain amount of HP and time your shots. Takes a bit of experimentation but use the letters in the names of the cabal to figure out the sweet spot.
---
Its how I masterworked mine because aside from 2 of the cabal the rest stay where they're at and don't attempt to rush you and they're too far to shoot you.
---
Nice
---
I did the burn kills in the Key area for the Leviathan raid then a friend said he did it in the Shadow thrall area in the whisper of the worm area. It took 2 hours for me to complete friend took 1hr 30 min

On the inside: 
---
# "FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-"
---
Yeah, but its a titan piece that explains a lot
---
Refresh the vanguard loot pool and ill run strikes again. Refresh shaxx ill play more crucible. Or just give me something thats not a horde mode. Everyone shits on season of the drifter but hey. Gambit prime wasnt a horde mode and the other mode had a time limit which added a good ammount of difficulty and fun which i enjoyed. But sucks because everyone complains whenever anything slightly difficult gets added and bungie starts to cater to dads with cerebral palsy who cant handle anything other than shoot enemy no think no difficult
---
I have a feeling this wasn't looked at clearly before it was done, it makes your shoulder look weird or deformed because it's in the wrong place and the lines are very thinly done in a few places they'll be gone very soon.
---
If I was you I would think about mybe doing some background behind the traveller just to take the roundness off your shoulder, it wouldn't look as weird, then go over those thin lines a bit if you can.
---
I'm not being mean I just think it could be alot better with just a bit more work.
---
Traction adds 5 mobility.
---
"Me smol"
---
"Me rip yo in half with smol Hammer"

The titan looks amazing. If you wanted criticism the hammer head looks weird undetailed. Other than that great job!
---
Thanks for the kind words! :)
---
Last season I got a set of iron Banner gear all 60 plus stats except for the gloves which were 59
---
Bungie changes things around to force the metal to change but when they do this they just create a new meta and the whole process begins again.  This is why I see everyone running around with bows and scout rifles.  Remember when hand cannons where the thing and then it was pulse rifles?
---
guardians of the solar system, at most
---
My exo looks like a confused potato
---
It's nice but I don't wanna buy a damaged product. Somebody already shot the leg. /s
---
Thanks
---
Between 15 matches of clash, 2 of then where close and thats obviously isnt healthy for the game, and dont even get me started on the toxic builds and degenerate loadouts you encounter thats just makes the playing field not fair unless you run a similar build yourself. If trials was to return now it wouldnt be fun at all and will also feel like a very bad chore
---
I just camp near the heavy with sweet business and mow down every one that comes near it.
---
It pisses people off but oh well.
---
Just keep shooting the face, right?
---
Hey can you make a hunter one? I want to make it my steam profile pic haha

Everybody gangster till ya gotta headbutt a fallen kell to death. Long live the crayon eaters.

It brings tears to the eye!

I’d scream
---
the houses retreated and we actually don’t know (unless there is a part of the lore i missed recently) if the houses are still a around, but after the Red War the House of Dusk emerged and is currently the only known Fallen House to be around. that’s why there’s only the one, and not the other.

Im there with Crimson + erenthil does it Make me original ?

This isn't an LFG sub.

Holy fucking shit
---
Feel the same with sunbracers. Or sunshot (I’m a new light player so the campaign doesn’t give you the exotics anymore) thankfully got that a few days ago tho.
---
Hey, as long as it works.
---
i once got nearly 10 exotic drops in one day, my friend nearly lost it and still hates my rng :DD
---
And I thought I had nice RNG
---
Lmao I have one of each race an I think the awoken look best. Idk I just kinda like the darker hints and things, too bad my awoken warlock from the back looks wacky so as shady once said, “The helmet stays on”
---
New things are nice. Being forced to use them arbitrarily isn't.
---
People have developed singular styles since day 1 of D1. Collect what we like, dismantle everything else. That's not going to change. This arbitrary forced quest nonsense will just turn people off to the game mode, if not the game itself.
---
That’s more than I’ve had since Shadowkeep!
---
The super needs to last maybe a couple seconds longer imo.
---
BRUH
---
Play the campaign. If you get stuck google the quest step you are on and you will find something. The community is really good about sharing. if you do PvP you can use any weapon and be affective. You’ll see all kinds of videos on god roll weapons and what to use. But honestly in PvP no weapon will really help you. It’s all dependent on how good you are.
---
Even then we’re doing a terrible job
---
If you check the destiny fashion page you'll find the man who did this, his user is N1TR0_Z3U5
---
I had one of those back in 4v4 i was alone against 4.
---
I won the game 4-0 only because of glory reset with a new season so i played against way worse players than me
---
I'm going to finish mine tonight and then bubble Titan to help others.
---
This gets mentioned multiple times a day. I don't even care and I know they know about I.
---
Heavy camping is the behaviour that makes the crucible unpleasant. Along with a full stack of super mods
---
That and/or a speed buff its so slow for a close range super.People can easily just run away when you pop it especially in competitive
---
Well atleast warlock are skillful 
---
Titans are just dumb knuckleheads
---
The one person complaining about the Hunter meta got downvoted
---
Especially when my friends come over and wanna play Halo I am so bad at moving. PC is way better for me. I have been using it all of my life.
---
BIG TITAN NEED BIG SNACK, NO?
---
Comp is alright because it's not a clusterfuck of supers. Almost all of the maps are designed for 3v3 or 4v4. Wormhaven is one of the few exceptions and even that gets hairy when players fight for heavy. Throw 6v6 in on some of the maps (especially Burning Shrine) and you won't see the end of the death screen. It happens so often in 6v6 on that map that you get killed from the same super 2 or 3 times because the map is small and you respawn at the dumbest places.
---
My qp winrate is like 20% lower than my comp winrate. wtf
---
Just leaving this here for posterity's sake, as I found this on a Google search looking for the math behind this triumph since I'm 2 tributes away from get the catalyst for bad juju. 
---
My current loadout is bad juju, epicurean, and fixed odds, with 4/5 armor slots taken up by opulent armor (along with my Orpheus Rigs equipped as a nightstalker). I just ran tree of probabilities twice in a row via nightfall ordeal (adept difficulty), and went from 21% to 32%, then to 43%.
---
I scored way under 50k each time (last run was 30,085).
---
So that's six legendary pieces and one exotic earning 11% per run. I'm going to assume 1.5% per legendary and 2% per exotic, but that's just me pulling that outta my ass. I'd imagine breaking the minimum threshold scales those percentages up.
---
I'm swapping my fixed odds to my wendigo and running it again to see my progress, cause I hate this LMG.
---
Clearly this means Warlocks need to be nerfed. 
---

After grinding all day for python yesterday, this just gave me flashbacks.

I think we’re the most balanced, just that the others are too unbalanced to return to balance
---
I recently discovered that Monte Carlo combos fantastically well with Crown of Storms, cuz the melee reset means that you're constantly getting charges for the crown and so everything else recharges super fast too. It's my new favorite combo.
---
Nope, but it's all I ever see. Charge this, shield bash that.
---
That the handfuls of crayons you've scarfed to not go directly to your brain, I guess.

If Leeroy was a titan, he would have soloed UBRS with that strat.

I have the ship and catalyst, I got it a couple weeks ago actually. I also love the mission. I just never really used the gun much, I like the tractor cannon too much and I’m almost done with the catalyst. Now that I know how much damage it can do though I’ll probably use it
---
Well the top dps hunter supers aren’t really really pvp tho. Möbius quiver will do more dmg then celestial nighthawk will do. Mobius sucks for pvp and celestial sucks for pvp unless you are only using it for super neutral game. And at that point you should just run the other void 1 shot super whatever it’s called. Middle arc strider, top tree golden gun, and spectral blades are the best pvp supers by far in not just hunters but almost every subclass in the game. I can only think sentenial shield and dawn blade to maybe compete.
---
It's all good.
---
I did mention I did this in D1. Did it in a couple of years ago. Felt good! My buddy would see the kill feed where I'm getting killed by 2-4 of them while taking one day. Respawn and charge past him and do it again. Ah, memories...😊
---
Well at least you still have a finger on the right stick with a claw grip. It’s tough, but it’s doable
---
I'll admit to doing this. I've had people sit there and pick off all the guys I was trying to do finishers on.
---
Sometimes there are too many enemies to revive immediately. Learn some patience man....
---
I like to throw on a dragonfly spec. Just in case you know?
---
Okay thanks
---
Other than by "edgy" we really mean "whining about literally everything"
---
Ok thanks
---
You can't LFG on this sub.. try r/DestinySherpa
---
Yeah I think I missed it too. He's already at the tower for me...
---
I revive my fireteam, so no issues here.
---
I got a quad with truth and it felt so fucking good
---
Well I play on pc so I don’t know the console feel. That sounds really rough. However on pc it’s pretty easily just disengaged and the kinda baited. Atleast when you are at max rank games. I don’t ever play quick play as it’s just easy. Really a warlock who gets overshield is much worse to regularly encounter.
---
Crossplay could work for pve but yeah, definitely not pvp
---
This is the way
---
Picking up your shotgun from your corpse in crucible.
---
Its wardcliff I've learned that if someone on the enemy team has on no matter what I do they end up killing me.
---
I really am more referring to something like knock out elimination at top flight as any ability use, super use, or special ammo can completely throw a match. I tract almost everyone’s abilities and shot call for my comp team. We have one titan using frontal assault, one titan running wars of dawn, and the rest warlocks of whatever class. We laugh at hunters.
---
This match was super unfun. I got sniped by the arabalest, it was a 3v6, and i got killed by the colony 20 times, give or take a few.
---
I don't know, after the kill feed I'd be laughing my ass off if I'd thrown that knife.   Some comedy is worth a death, including pretty much every time Antaeus works.
---
Nah wardcliff coil is a biotch the only advantage is the spread damage in situations like that where you don't have time to actually aim your heavy and it's better than dying and losing it. They probably don't have the catalyst or it would've killed him too.
---
The higher you get in comp, the more hunters you see. Why don’t you use hunters exactly?
---
don't know about this chief, I call DIM
---
Cause the game is not segregated between console and PC. It is the same experience no matter which platform you play on. It isn't fair to give even more advantage to PC players. 
---
While I understand the statement, I do play both. Switched to PC with Shadowkeep but go back to console to help friends. PC already has a heavy advantage on FPS, menu access, no bloom an so much more. No need to code the game differently for just PC.
---
While it would be nice, it just isn't feasible. Got enough complaints for Eververse, Lack of Content, Bounty hunting an so on, last thing we need is complaints they are favoring PC. It is a very delicate balance they have to maintain.
---
Well it seems like you’re self-aware.
---
I really rarely see them around 4500. I encounter Titan and warlocks more than anything as I face more teams. I dont solo que often and that may have a different class pool. Not sure.
---
Thanks guardian💜
---
Canon came out in 2017
---
Melee damage is arc
---
If your catalyst offer extends to others, I’d love to try it. I have the weapon already but that’s it.
---
As a solo queue, I rarely see anything but hunters at top level. Hunters are easily the best class for solo play, because of the easy correction of mistakes
---
This comic was from 2017 IIRC
---
I now have this saved as well haha. 
---
I have to admit it was difficult remembering the pictures and trying to figure out which gun is which from the spreadsheet version I've been using. The website is more much natural.
---
Thank you for posting this!
---
Every 5 levels you get a bright engram
---
Thanks didn't know that, I need to catch up on lore
---
What handcannon is that I’ve seen it from older destiny 2 clips
---
This why you use truth
---
Ayee better him than me
---
Can u really help? Oh yee here i come
---
I appreciate the effort in putting the text on the paper in the second panel
---
Like a lot of things in this game, it isn't explained very well. You're just kinda dropped in at the deep end with no guidance. It's unfortunate, but it's passed up a lot. Me, being a new light player just introduced my launch day friends to it and they're in awe lol.
---
I think he was so shocked at what was happening that he was going to hold on to it when he expected them to die lol
---
Most people are like that anyway, block, report, send a death threat, move on. Just not worth trying raids, from the experiences of you, and people like you, its a clear waste of time, considering the people that do them.
---
Plot twist: the guy actually meant the three guardians on the left
---
DUDE! Holy heck that's nuts
---
Me:Plays hunter and dies instantly.           Everyone else:
---
And its just a sundial.
---
One for each sub class!
---
Idk if that’s true but if so how would he know
---
Whose eating crayons, now
---
Yeah thats a glitch all right
---
Oof I’m on console. But I may be getting a computer sometime January. On a side note, is there a way to spread my console account to both computer and console
---
Not always. Sometimes there are too many enemies around.
---
But think about it like this. Go into a raid with 5 hunters, and a warlock. Everyone uses Aeon exotics. All hunters have 100 mobility. They are the gerbils, and the warlock now has infinite fucking grenades
---
That was great
---
#no
---
Forever 99
---
Why do you hate lucky
---
Yup it is called cross save
---
Replace the beer with crayons 🖍
---
Thanks fam...
---
Check task manager for destiny and close it there then try launch the game again
---
Man I used to hate this super back when it was hella OP but this was dope
---
Glory has nothing to do with comp matchmaking. It's sbmm/elo/ bungie magic.
---
Light level advantage is rough. I usually run last perdition and dust rock but I’m lower light level so dust rock just tickles them.
---
We ain’t bringing this meme to destiny
---
I’m ok with grinding new weapons each season. I’m having a blast with the Saint weapons right now as an example. I’m not ok with this trend we’re heading towards of needing a new armour set each season. 
---
Y2 was great for armour. You didn’t necessarily need the new stuff, with exception of Gambit P stuff. In BA I only went for the armour because I liked it. 
---
With Y3 you basically need a Shadowkeep set for Nightmare mods since they’re so incredibly good. GoS armour is also nearly required since the mods in there are so incredibly good too. This season not so much but when they release another Raid I imagine that armour set will be required because the mods will be too good to pass up again. 
---
But the main issue for me personally at the bottom of all this is that most of the armour just looks so bad. Let me ornament any armour piece, like I can do in just about any other mmo out there.
---
If you're on PC, yea. I'm getting on D2 when windows finishes updating. (Won't be too long from now)
---
I miss revenant Revenant &amp; Chatterwhite
---
It might when you pick up heavy off of the ground from a guardian kill, that’s how the heavy scavenger perks work. I haven’t tested it though
---
Nice thanks
---
Fingers crossed over here then.
---
Stop using lord of wolves
---
Hey don't kill me but that wrong with being a Titan. I play a Titan and it ain't that bad.
---
Cross save. It either permanently puts you on PC, or let's you do both
---
Ooh
---
Actually miss my midnight coup
---
That's what we call an INSIDE joke. You could call it a cliché...
---
You're correct, it's not even a game of Control it's literally a game revolving around heavy
---
Yeah your not spamming lol, people got butthurt for some reason idk.
---
It’s when he’s not glowing blue...
---
In the same voice from forsaken cutscene “Osiris, is a bitch”
---
People must be sharing jokes with Uldren inside The Voice Of Riven then because I've heard none of these. Not even the Titan one. I figured someone was just being salty because people complained they shoulder charge too much.
---
Updooted
---
The heavy iron banner quest sucks balls
---
Wait, he gets immunity?
---
Relatable.
---
I did... then my computer broke lmao
---
"You shall drown in the deep" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
You should post this it r/destinythegame . We don't have any of the devs as mods for this subreddit
---
Please explain how they arent like that anymore
---
Was that weapon doing 1/4-1/3 of a million each shot? I want that rifle.
---
Different game, different experience. A lot of things are changed on PC that creates a divide in play.
---
Yeah man, it's an incredibly fun build for PVP and even PVE.
---
also played console for d2 until forsaken, again, really not that hard
---
How do I do the season of dawn story? Thanks.
---
vex is pretty easy imo
---
This week I’ve gotten the most pure exotic drops than in the past month and it’s kind of terrifying
---
I got the rocket launcher stuff done and maybe two or three hours of play with wardcliff coil but it felt dirty doing the things I had to do to get those kills.
---
I mean you can, but sometimes you shouldn't.
---
An exotic for each subclass. You one lucky warlock. May they have good rolls.
---
Blast him after he tethers you
---
Foreskin
---
Bad news after hand cannons comes 10 rocket launcher kills, this season pursuit definitely missed the mark imo last seasons was much easier to do than this one.
---
Same, and my armor stats when i turned in the tokens was max 58.
---
Lol at that point I just do it solo and 70% of it I finish it solo.
---
“Hey ugly”
---
The hammer throwing Titan, probably.
---
Maybe our hotfix in January will fix this so I don’t have to reload the landing zone 28 1/2 times
---
It counters the bubble Titans put on the heavy. Kills the Titan and there body explodes killing anyone else in the bubble.
---
Weren't we only able to find him because of Osiris though.
---
Me neither...
---
I mean, it’s usually 5-7 times but I hope so too.
---
That'a so damn amazing!
---

Isn't the hunters supposed to be blue?
---
Titans may eat crayons, but they can help when the time is rigjt
---
Literally the definition of "Leroy Jenkins!!!!!!!!!"
---
To me it makes no difference if it’s one or two weapons, as long as they also have uses besides dps (which anarchy definitely does). One of my other favorite loadouts is mountaintop + whatever energy + whisper, so I’m not saying whisper isn’t good. I’m only saying there are other options which can match the dps and functionality.
---
When said downed player is a potato and runs into the middle of 30 vex backed up by 2 cyclopses its not better to revive him
---
Play rumble with chaperone.
---
get a better gf buddy

I missed more than i would like to admit lol.

Exos for sure sound cool. My personal favorite is Awoken.

If you’re on Xbox I can help you get it, I’ll grab a friend and we can carry you through the regular version.
---
it's actually not. he both acts as a distraction for you and gives you a free overshield.
---
Aztecross, is that you?
---
That's going to be your RNG luck for the rest of your life. I hope it was worth it. 😅

It WaSnT rEaL CoMmUnIsm.

People like you are why the West is dying. Capitalism brought properity to the West, and communism destroyed Russia. China is communist in leadership, but had to institute state controlled capitalism in order to prosper.
---
Capitalism didn't cause those dictatorships, Communism ALWAYS ends up authoritarian.
---
Lower Draw Time number = Faster draw time, no idea what you're even saying tbh.
---
You need to shut your mouth and computer. Your whining about a comment from over a month ago. Do you know how pathetic that makes you look on top of the fact that you’re complaining about someone else enjoying something you don’t.  You are a narcissist and a piece of trash who needs to do some more reading than playing video games because like you, your grammar is trash.
---
Idk they’re great but damn they’re ugly
---
I can't stand this game anymore, sick of recycled shit, exotics, crucible matching and the cheaters. And what are bungie doing about it, fuck all. Not wasting anymore money on the subpar content. That nightmare add on along with the vex season, were the worst things I've played on this game and that's saying something. This new season wasn't getting any of money, especially as this is how the Osiris dlc should of been. It just seemed like a quick way to throw out some content with as little effort as possible.
---
I want to get a good roll wizened rebuke
---
Yeah, it is rng though. If you haven't finished the iron banner quest then you'll have a better chance as it will be only weapons in the loot pool. 
---
Completing the quest adds the armor to the loot pool.
---
That comic was from 2017 it's a reference to destiny.
---
You made french fries out of those potatoes.
---
Thought I was the only one. Can’t get the smg to save my life
---
Huh, so it is just me.
---
But bro how can it be that a draw time 576 bow feels stupidly slow compared to a 720?
---
Honestly I really like the character talking and I wish they didn't get rid of it
---
Happened to me. My teammate was behind a rock and my ghost wasn't . I died 3 or 4 times and my teammate laughed at me.
---
Ob yea on my look I only use monochromatic because I dont have the nine shader lol😂
---
There's a setting that auto centers your sights. Can't remember if it's under gameplay settings or controller settings.
---
They’re just salty Karen took the kids
---
Looks good tho
---
The main problem I see with this is the comp meta, because if it's good enough you're essentially turning the game into something like Overwatch where somebody on the team would _need_ to take a healing role, otherwise the enemy healing would make them unbeatable.
---
Ita the finder mods. The way they work is they cause an additional brick to spawn. You can tell it's from the finder perk since it glows brighter. Those bricks give only a little bit of ammo.
---
Not sure how much more you expect for $3 a month, but you spend your money how you want to.
---
"rng" ?
---
Found the guy who T-bags in a 3-1! 👆🏻
---
I use Last Perdition, it's pretty great with the right roll!
---
You get 64-66-point gear from the season pass. That’s what these are: a guaranteed drop.
---
Imagine taking a game so seriously it causes marital issues. And posting about it on Reddit instead of getting counseling. This happened/10
---
i tried to match the gambit snake colors
---
Same thing different day, new content fills like all the content, if you have play destiny2 at all its, its all the same...
---
Ah cool
---
I love Stomp-ees in PvE, and I can't deny if you're shotgun Ape-ing in PVP they're pretty lovely... But I crutch radar too hard, 9/10 i'm using Knucklehead in PvP.
---
I’m drawing a blank, who’s the other woman?
---
Voidwalker, use the Nezarec’s Sin helmet, use only Void weapons. Set your armor up so discipline is 100.
---
And you found a couple of rather ugly 90s. Well, beat up. The rest of the insulation looks good though.
---
What about an exotic gauntlet that changes your melee attack into a ranged heal? Make it fire a charge like the warlock middle tree melee and have a small AoE or tracking charge. Then it'll be dependent on melee cooldown, but it'll be something you'll always have without having to get ammo for it, and it can restore a portion of shields / start immediate regen. It'll be useable for all classes, theoretically giving everyone the ability to be support (some more then others)
---
To add on. It will also let you use your tokens and by the end of the quest, if you did the bounties, you'll have 300 or 400 tokens to use at 10(20?) a pop. I got 2 hero burdens from them all lol
---
It's an awesome weapon in pve and pvp tho.
---
Wants us to tell him “nooo it’s looks amazing.”
---
Gameplay wise, very little, it goes off when enemies are near and does area damage to them. Lore wise it's part of the awoken's defense system.
---
One of my favorites!
---
Ah, now i see.
---
  
---
Great art, anyway!
---
wen da big ugly in front you, make big BIG hamer out of lite and do hit
---
it make big ugly go bye and that make my fireteem hapy
---
thay say good job titan and that make me hapy bcuz i luv my fireteem
---
So if I don't shadowkeep, do I lose out on raid gear content and best gear/exotics?
---
Ahh thanks, I just need a game to fill in some time lol guess it'll do for now
---
Does the 720 have archers tempo?
---
Good job.
---
In my experience, the more I play the more clearly I'll see my mistakes down the road, but also over confidence is a slow and insidious killer, I try to do the 980 NF just to humble myself and make me play conservatively. though I fail miserably at the NF to makes me feel/do better in more realistic tasks
---
That's some pretty bad artifacting. You sure it's exclusive to destiny 2? Your video card might be dying. Undo any overclocks (if you have) ASAP
---
Try switching your jump mode. There is o e of them that goes higher
---
Explain this tactic, please.
---
What happens when there are too many enemies around your ally to revive them without dying?
---
Edit: Read it wrong. I interpreted it as the teammate is shooting enemies that are around the ghost, not that the teammate is next to the ghost shooting enemies.
---
A friend on mine once got 29, how people invade so well is beyond me
---
Or if you're lucky
---
+1 Enhancement Core
---
Yeah that just happens in Destiny 2. Also cant seem to run Modern warfare but pretty sure it's not related. Can run other games fine and could run COD up until last update
---
I think he got all my stuff ... and yours and yours ...
---
...don't instakill the boss and wait for two named knights to spawn
---
What weapons did you use?
---
No problem! Message me on here, it’s fastest that way
---
Oh and as for overclocks, it has a factory clock but I removed that too and even underclocked with no effect
---
Bungie needs to get rid of the lootboxes entirely, not put more worthwhile shit in them.
---
Funny you say that, I've just started my warlock class and I'm really liking it a lot.
---
Ive definitely gotten the "death heals primeval" message when killed by npc enemies surfing an invasion. As far as I know, they weren't close to me and didn't cause any damage at all. Its common enough that I assumed any death was attributed to the invader.
---
No step on snek
---
thank you 🙇🏻‍♂️🙇🏻‍♂️
---
Then check that HDR is disabled from D2
---
Everyone should go back to 2010 and play Left 4 Dead. Don’t rez, GO. 
---
3 players in a strike is better than 1. (Plus in NF, waiting for a rez is boring. I make tea now).
---
The option is grayed out and defaulted to off
---
This happened to me in hunter. I stayed on one point, and every time the enemy would try and take it I'd throw a grenade. They would die before they noticed.
---
Definitely a fair point. I personally prefer a controller, (mostly because I haven't put the time in to adjust to mouse and keyboard), so I usually play crucible on PS4 and everything else on PC. Cross save is great.
---
I assume you played it through the strike playlist? You have to select the mission in the titan map, bear in mind it is not the normal strike. I hope you have friends, because i dont think it is possible to solo.
---
Yes army was mistake, make lots money now tho, yes missed good season, but what is greenie weeeeeeniee
---
AIGHT, you won. Are you a boog boi?
---
please tell me you are
---
just happened to me lol. can't help myself
---
GOod job, you grabbed a thesaurus. Big words don't make you intelligent bud.
---
My first exotic was a riskrunner. (I’ve only been playing for 3 months). I really like this gun, still running it on my warlock.
---
Underated comment.
---
To be fair I haven't even found the mission to go find saint 14
---
If you think any of those words were too obscure, I weep for whatever education system you suffered through.
---
Pffft. Wormgod caress, solar plexus, mid tree solar titan.
---
Lol ask ur squad leader. I was in the Marines, converted to the army, and regretted it. Now I'm out.
---
Yea

Obviously

This is how strategy works. Thing gets hit hard enough-&gt;thing dies

This should be recognized more, as one of the greatest jokes I have seen on Reddit

Absolutely glorious, that super shutdown was icing on the cake

For context : we were sitting waiting on a friend, and others joined in.

Ammo capacity 69. Nice

Starts at [$160](https://scufgaming.com/) and then you customize from there.
---
i can hear your processor screaming out that it's too big
---
Yeah they are easier than scorn, but all the hydra explosions and teleporting minotaurs are annoying
---
Ok: I hate hunters but that was badass!
