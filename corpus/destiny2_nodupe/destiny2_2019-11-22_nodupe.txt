Don't mind me, I'm just picking some flowers while safe in my skullfort.

---
---
i mistyped that, i meant nightfall.  i finally got it after like 7 hours and 50 runs tho
---
Agreed.
---
That boss also has less health I think
---
Maybe you should post it to bungies Twitter then it would help your cause because your just pissing in the wind here.
---
Has to be a headshot though lmao
---
Also, my brother upgraded his GPU but not his power supply and it would run fine on most games but more graphic intense games would shut his PC down. He got a higher psu and no issues now.
---
Noble gunslingers rise, this is our time to shine
---
Not to be that guy, but water sports make you sweaty and hot. Even in the water. An ice cold water bottle dumping over you feels so good. It's almost an unbeatable feeling.
---
F
---
sounds like a titan complaining about a ‚Äúbroken, one shot‚Äù mechanic LUL
---
This is one of those lore tabs they retcon later.
---
It's part of the fun, can't have it be braindead like Titan shoulder charge lol
---
Yo imagine failing reading comprehension, I‚Äôm not complaining I‚Äôm happy, because that means every hunter will now, well if they‚Äôre not disingenuous pathological liars, can‚Äôt cry about the titan one shot melee when there‚Äôs is better in every way
---
The gun is restored to its glory. I'm sure he would be proud, Guardian!
---
Could... Yes
---

---
Would...
---
 Best part [1:19](https://youtu.be/Y2hBIbffv48)
---
titan one shot melee is not a projectile, it‚Äôs a melee to begin with, on top of one of the most powerful supers in the game. PVP wise hunters are the weakest.
---
Crimson with Karnstein is one of my favorite builds for most things. Really rewards playing aggressive.
---
But them explosions from Sunshot probably make it my favorite HC now that they buffed it's mag size.
---
Pinnacle armor would be awesome!
---
You don‚Äôt play the game then, Mr Strawman
---
Unless it‚Äôs a night stalker, shadow shot is like the anti fun super of crucible, it‚Äôs the super you use when the only thing you care about is ruining other people day
---
The nova bombs then explode, sending Gallahorn missiles in every direction, but instead of there being tracking cluster bombs on detonation, it explodes into MORE Gally missiles, which then explode into the tracking cluster bombs.
---
God dammit I crossposted this yesterday but it got taken down because it wasn‚Äôt destiny related :((
---
Above
---
This is a beautiful build! im gonna steal it.
---
Where is this info from please?
---
For sure Not, you are a kid who is producing a shit Playmobile. You are my Hero.
---
Looks like team rocket is blasting off again
---
Luckily, I have a Gallahorn.
---
It took me 10 years but i was finally able to find the comments that weren't asking for files.
---
fucking finally, some good changes
---
This week at bungie. Looks like all the solar classes are getting reworks.
---
Yea lol
---
Practice, apostate
---
The Dan was the only was I got recluse, outlaw/kc with max range

Miscolored
---
Bruh, I feel you. I've been waiting for this change since destiny 2 came out.
---
GOS gets really stale as well, and the Dungeon imo looks no where near as cool as Shattered Throne did.
---
The name is literally in the sub title...
---
That is correct but she hasn‚Äôt been present for the past several months. This is actually an old screenshot I had from last years festival but it was removed from the main sub because they don‚Äôt like memes over there
---
file gang
---
This is amazing, thank you.
---
I have the same problem. This is driving me insane.
---
Will give it a shot. Thanks.
---
I prefer high impact reserves for PvP stuff.
---
I have one of those with high cal rounds as well.
---
Going to try it now. Thanks a lot.
---
My mom tells me otherwise. And that's something I live with everyday. Burn.
---
I don't even have a titan, but it annoys tf outta me when my teammates go around to dps.
---
I wasn't expecting to be attacked like this
---
Hunters poke it with Liar's Handshake
---
I could run it with you, i‚Äôve done it many times
---
Made me lol hard. And I just pulled shinobus randomly.... time to make Shaxx proud!
---
On PS4. But yeah, please keep me posted.
---
The few times this has happened to me they emoted for a second, then all proceeded to gangbang me to victory. It hurt.
---
Nope its savathun the o bearer o mine comes from the ahamkara. As stated by the ahamkara exotics. This time around its savathun tricking us.https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.vgr.com/destiny-2-the-dreaming-city-true-ending-was-a-trap-bungie-confirms/amp/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjH7cepxvzlAhUCUa0KHa6GB2QQFjAFegQIAhAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Sxt0po3CGYXvIyZgQ8aB0&amp;ampcf=1
---
Was in DTG got my eververse bad fill for rest of my life u know u dont HAVE to buy anything
---
Because it a mirror
---
Respect the drip
---
i mean if i get a shitty match i will quit the game cuz why play a match when you are the only one that wants to win?
---
Standby for Edge Transit.
---
This made me realllllyyy want a fusion rifle in destiny that‚Äôs basically the noisy cricket from Men In Black. How fucking amazing would it be to vaporise other guardians with a tiny gun half the size of a sidearm
---
You have to complete a rare bounty, not a quest
---
I need to call my dad. Thank him for bringing home an SNES and Megaman X when I was five.
---
Is Shadowkeep free? If not how much is it and if I bought it does it include the season pass? And how long is the season pass staying? Sorry for asking a lot but I can‚Äôt find to seem any other helpful way and thank you so far!
---
Bro this was so much fun to watch üòÇüòÇ
---
They wish to kill you.... Kill them back.
---
It's on the side bar dude. Literally copied and pasted it to you.
---
That's a new exotic handcannon?
---
I wou ld be broke in a heartbeat if they did this oml though i would be the most pimp gaurdian in the world
---
Hey, if they want to burn their super on me with zero motes instead of teammates that have motes, that's fine by me.
---
Play
---
Yeehaw I smell a space cowboy
---
Get some friends
---
I never said that's not what I wanted, I was essentially telling you what you said was almost wrong. Shoulder charge is one of the easiest things to counter in the game, and is not an any of the meta Titan subclass tree rn, so it's pretty rare. Hand held is pretty OP however especially with controverse hold, being able to recharge it so fast. And yeah. The classes have disadvantages to each other, and have advantages. With OEM gone, one class isn't much better than any of the others
---
Might have a charge time masterwork, so I can see why he wouldn‚Äôt in that case.
---
R u sure it‚Äôs not Subtle Calamity? I thought Arsenic bite wasn‚Äôt a compound bow
---
That was exceptional.
---
You can make a pretty similar build for warlocks using top tree stormcaller. Get max discipline and stack it with a demolitionist+breach refraction smg, auto rifle, or hand cannon. Idk if there are any exotic armors that will really work with it but it's been pretty good for dealing with groups of enemies.
---
Bolt caster!
---
Then I'd go with discord if I were you, even though I've never tried doing that
---
Nice
---
"Keep your fucking grape away from me"
---
Fatebringer
---
You have a horrible, horrible attitude and I don‚Äôt wish being teamed up with you on anyone. 
---
But the answer here is ‚Äúget a fireteam.‚Äù
---
I mean: *get a fireteam.* it‚Äôs easy. 
---
My apologies to anyone that accepts your LFG though. Grow up.
---
It has fluted and chambered.
---
Using chambered as it gives the recoil buff and the minus in handling is irrelevant since I have overflowing handling regardless.
---
Honestly after thinking about it more, I am happy.  The handling MW negates the chambered handling deduction and I still have accurized rounds for range.
---
Have been going crazy being upset about the MW.
---
I have no clue - haven't been keeping track
---
Thanks for the advise. I‚Äôm jumping into some exotic weapon quests to get the newest guns. Bad JuJu first. Haha
---
wat
---
I would have been so mad if that you had done that to me lol
---
FOR THE PUPPIES
---
If this keeps happening to you: it‚Äôs you. Not them.
---
Lol my dude sorry to break it to you but we've been asking for this for 5 years. Really stoked it will finally happen.
---

Artifact resets and that‚Äôs it as far as we know
---
Oh, my bad.
---
Just take a break from gaming for now. I do it every now and then. Or I'll go through my list of free games and find something different to play. 
---
If you have "The Surge" (was free a while back) I highly recommend it. Sometimes just playing another genre of game altogether helps me get over the blahs. Or if its bad makes me appreciate Destiny more.
---
Nah you can see the shadowkeep icon on the loot from it not the season icon. You also need shadowkeep to play the raid
---
Obligatory "Parry this you fucking casual"
---
Oh yeah from the trailer
---
Your teammates left. Bungie can‚Äôt prevent that. 
---
Get a fireteam or accept that this stuff will happen.
---
BOLT GANG RISE UP
---
Wtf I‚Äôve had d2 since it first came out and I haven‚Äôt gotten the recluse‚òπÔ∏è
---
Ok .....?
---
Way to hit him when he‚Äôs down
---
Yeah it's exactly the same thing but a Hydra instead of a Minotaur
---
If you have Facebook look me up @RaidReadyPrints
---
Dude. He had some of the best lines in D1. Won't ever forget him asking "Psst. Take me with you." Like... Bud let's go kick Taniks in the taint, purge the prison of Skolas, AND get some of that good ass ramen. I'll buy.
---
It's probably one of the best Destiny expansions if not the best.
---
Bungie needs to cater to low sens and high sens people and add more aim settings but our voices are so small it‚Äôll never happen üò§
---
i think its okay to buy, since the progress of season pass will active after you buy the season pass, and the shadowkeep will always work forever
---
And this is r/destiny2
---
Why would it?
---
Props get it for Christmas then if it‚Äôs THIS GOOD
---
No, I got no teammates in the first place and had already quit a match earlier so I didn‚Äôt want to do that again
---
No problem
---
It's a tie between ace of spades and crimson. I just enjoy using both as they both fit that nice looking and fun thing I love
---
The recoil is crazy on it.
---
If you had a D2 Guardian on another platform that you'd like to use on Stadia, you'll have to activate Cross Save on bungie.net. Otherwise, that's the New Light intro that was added some time ago for new players.
---
Cayde didn‚Äôt die lol
---
Well for two years the bubble has been shit
---
Nightfalls are just strikes but they‚Äôre way harder and you can use an inventory item ‚Äú5 of swords‚Äù (I think) to change handicap level and modifiers. 
---
There‚Äôs a timer and a score counter for nightfalls so you need to try finish quickly and kill everything to get a good enough score. 
---
So basically what the ordeals do minus the barrier and overload champions. And plus the ability to change modifiers.
---
And no matchmaking
---
It‚Äôs really not my gamer tag is the greysonmonkey I‚Äôm in the gameplay, the person who made the video messaged me telling me I was in the gameplay just to make sure I was ok with it.
---
YES BROTHER! DARKNESS SHALL BE PURGED!!!
---
Stonks
---
And you‚Äôre at 42/50 on your ‚Äúkills without dying‚Äù daily bounty
---
The others need to be in Amethyst Veil or something while you're in Monochromic(?) For this to work. Happy clan day also! Mine just finished a few hours ago with a big PvP punch fest. Everyone - Titan with skull fort using top tree striker. Best. Day. Ever.
---
Ohhh. Right. I forgot that was part of the game. I don't really have a group to play with so me and my clanmate just do stuff that doesn't need more than 1 or two people. Does the 5 of swords modifiers effect the ordeal?
---
Guy taps them on there shoulder
---
Love this guy already. He gets the Titan way. I'll get my hammers.
---
&gt;Leviathan
---
They probably didn't think about adding it as one though.
---
Yeah bolt caster, it was superior of the two swords because of the range
---
Am I understanding correctly that this week is shotgun week for escalation protocol? I only have to complete wave 7, right? Then repeat 6-7 until the shotgun drops? 
---
https://www.shacknews.com/article/109181/escalation-protocol-schedule-destiny-2
---
dragon's shadow + marksman's dodge
---
... see my above comment.
---
The drop rates for most things in this game are not known, unfortunately.
---
I envy the resolution of this
---
I made the post to discuss thoughts and perhaps incite feedback on how other players feel, maybe read the post instead of jumping to your conclusion that I‚Äôm just complaining
---
It won‚Äôt drop down your good to go
---
Nah once you finish that it is good man.
---
The forged rotate daily. The playlist for them is in earth on the bottom left. Check it each day. 
---
The only requirement is to do that introductory quest for it that is about the black armory machine gun and required a few things. You'll have the forges unlocked once you get to the step that says "complete a forge ignition".
---
When sucking is what it‚Äôs supposed to do lmao
---
Thanks God, hated that part, have to play super safe
---
It's most likely lore for an activity you haven't played or unlocked yet like menagerie or reckoning. I've see a few people posting the same thing.
---
If you‚Äôre talking about the platinum starling it doesn‚Äôt actually come from gofannon forge, it comes from a triumph that requires  you to do 100 frames.
---
They're discussing about how shit their Guardians are.
---
Here's hoping that there's gonna be a recipe for Vex milkshakes
---
Thanks! How many forges are there
---
How is it any different? All I see in comp is the last word or recluse.
---
A blessing to hunters everywhere!  
---
Just a meme I thought of when reading the Twab
---
Yes yes it is. Spinning around is a hastle even at 10. It's hard to play in PvP that way
---
I see. Thanks for the reply üëç
---
Black talon is pretty much a mini dawnblade
---
Go Figure

No I mean like is that real

I think it is

And no one on reddit is talking about top tree dawnblade getting gutted. Fantastic

From a Nightfall. Strikes don't drop specific loot.

The vanguard are leaders. Figure heads if you will. Canonically our guardian is the strongest. Far surpassing that of Zavala Ikora cayde or anyone else. But just because someone can out lift the president doesn‚Äôt make them the leader suddenly. Get what I‚Äôm saying?
---
I'm gonna wait and see how gimmicky it is.  The more stupid the gimmick, the less likely it is I'll buy it.  (The exception, of course, being the possibility of a ramen recipe, in honor of Cayde.  If that's there, I'm buying it day 1)
---
Say that class ability thing again to my triple Distribution hunter that charges a super in 5 dodges.
---
We can assume that Z, I and C had similar power levels and we killed caydes killer so I would assume so

Bottom tree sentinel and Doomfang Pauldrons.

I was on a 19 kill streak with a single super when I got kamikaze‚Äôd by a rocket launcher.

Kinda just screams "shoot here!" I'm thinking the phalinx cabal are the F students of the space rhino's miltary school
---
It's called Better Out Than In.
---
yea i gotta admit , lets say i completed it , and got the discount, im still not gonna buy that or most of the stuff. 1- most of it is expensive for the good stuff you'd want anyway plus a paper craft mask??
---
Oh I got lucky with the crevice brush...
---
It's 21% delirium the gambit pinnacle one
---
i did. couldnt find an answer
---
It's a free template you can print out and make at home.
---
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Icarus the Unwise?
---
I mean for the most part that was an even match. It was one person who did very well. Everyone else did similar to each other.
---
so the only way to get the gun is through the nighfall section on the map?
---
thank you
---
You have to complete an in-game triumph to unlock it, then it will give a discount code that makes it a free pdf download.
---
You have two hours to amend your statement...
---
I have a friend, that wrecks the place with a build that uses it. I don't play it personally, just seen what it can do. I can ask him if you'd like to duel, if you wish.
---
I'm guessing you meant my. That's 21% delirium.
---
As a new light player, this was one of my first exotics and have been running this build with arc battery and bomber mods. Don‚Äôt have max discipline yet tho still trying to max my recovery first
---
boomerism isn't age, its a state of mind

ok boomer

i like the idea but i doubt they would ever put the word Detroit or Smash on an exotic lol

Wasn't there some lore tidbit around the outbreak mission saying that prime engrams actually have crazy valuable treasure inside them, but that rahool simply exchanges it for some random armor/weapon he has lying around
---
Beloved
---
This is what I meant: nerf disguised as a buff. And I feel it, I wanted some love not a complete rework
---
Yeah, that part had to be a bug (for once in his favor though)
---
EDZ 100
---
Shhhh
---
I know right! It was mostly the teammates for me. I would do good and everyone else would mess up. Since I had no clears and tons of experience I had to be with people on LFG that had no clears.
---
Yesterday I went into a post that said GoS final boss kwtd and I matched with people with 5+ clears. I thought I wasn't qualified but we all ended up 2 phasing the boss on our first try. It was nuts.
---
it counts by just DEFEATING them... each grant 1%
---
You're either really new to the game or baiting for replies lul. Judging class potency off the class ability is very simple-minded.
---
Now here‚Äôs some recycled content I can get on board with... bring it bungie!!
---
I got crushed by a warsat on the moon today... in D2 , not D1
---
they run on diesel tho.
---
I have a friend who isn't a team player and he's impossible to teach
---
Not gonna lie, took me a second to realise that recluse wasn‚Äôt some new super beast auto rifle version lol.
---
I have a wonderful headset, trying to work on spacial awareness has that is a weak point, but back pedaling into a wall sure doesn‚Äôt help in 6v6 when the maps are meant for 4v4 lol
---
Oh my ears!
---
and i‚Äôm more specifically talking about Mindbenders ambition seeing as i see it about the same as recluse now in the crucible
---
"Guardian Down"
---
That tree is one of only a couple Titan trees I actually like (mainly because so many others require sprinting for the melee and I found them unreliable compared to tossing a hammer all the time) and was so worried they were about to nerf it when I saw the title text. lol
---
It was all over the marketing for forsaken are you kidding me?
---
And Iron Banner.
---
Well I know. But his question was also about the phrase and the phrase is not unique to Savathun.
---
Calus for example also uses this phrase.
---
Cayde was an honorable man, Epstein deserved worse than death
---
Map knowledge.
---
Nope. She was only there for the first seven(?) resets down new light players cannot encounter her. But can still go to her court and get the lore associated with it and loot
---
Nice edit üëç
---
So we‚Äôll always remember.
---
That‚Äôs not practical for prompt pew pew
---
Damn it, i wish we can turn legendaries into ornaments then, like using some kind of one time token atleast
---
The shattered throne dungeon
---
I did that for a while until I found out you can shoot the center
---
Just before EVERY season this gets reposted. Mods please ban this person. A simple image search on google will show what I mean
---
I have nothing but respect for folks that can do this. 
---
With everyone saying comp is easier now I thought maybe I could get recluse. 
---
*cries in 900 glory*
---
At least until the end of the season anyway.
---
Also looks bonkers in [dark places](https://i.imgur.com/bwGROMR.png).
---
And we are proud to present: the new Nike AirBoosts
---
It was a good trick, if a little late.
---
Punchy boi obviously 
---
Have you seen Titan Punches? He can probably punch you back through time
---
Vesper of radius is wayyyyy more useable now due to arc battery
---
it's there as a memorial for Cayde-6
---
It‚Äôs BIG fishing rod

Where‚Äôs Nessie??

Genuinely thought these were BDSM tools all packaged together before I saw the picture on the right

I was thinking the same thing
---
Last Word with Laconic skin - literally the reason i bought Forsaken and season pass a couple of days after they announced Last Word to be released. The gun is perfect for me in terms on animations and stats, i hope masterwork will be released soon with some range boost slapped on it.  
---
On 2nd spot Sunshot (with Red Dward skin for visuall aesthetic). It has very unique look, while not perfect, has super cool custom reload animation and 'heat-up' visual during continous firing.  
---
Rose on 3rd for cool name, standard cool revolver-look and satisfying using.  
---

Honorable mention for malfeasance for cool design, nice visuals and beeing MVP against any taken nightfalls or Whisper of the Worm quest face-rolling.

i have a toaster comp :(

It‚Äôs one of the 3 nightfall options this week so go run it
---
Not gonna lie, I've popped a bubble for weapons of light in offensive and some poor bastard has blown himself sky-high with a rocket or nade launcher xD
---
guy's name is a symbol for mountaintop + a symbol for recluse = insecure
---
For new light players who never got them like my friend
---
I‚Äôd loved that D1 set for all classes! That wolf was cool man
---
So cayde is still alive
---
Dude I hope the ramen is in there
---
Yeah me too... I hope to find a decent group to play with
---
Not sure about the nightfall, but the rare bounty thing is false. What was happening, was people were completing "bounties" that would drop them on forge completion (That was confirmed by a mod from this sub)
---
Yeah I‚Äôve had this conversation only almost everyday for almost a year now. Just drop D1 back into D2, charge people a full $60 and I promise a majority would buy it because it‚Äôs legitimately good content.
---
Nothing has been released in regards to season of the dawn yet
---
Oh ok. But that was an even more absurd melt if it was regular control
---
I want an exotic sqord that leaves the heads of your kills on the floor
---
Trump wasn't involved
---
Use 2 breach refactor on your chest armor , and anti barrier on your recluse , it's should fully recharge ur grenade with just 5 kills
---
:0
---
How??
---
So we nerfed oem and recluse. Now we need a new cheese. Well titans are getting old to cheese with so let‚Äôs go with hunters. Let‚Äôs make their entire fucking class two times more broken than oem and recluse combined. Good luck anyone within 15 feet of a hunter running bottom tree gunslinger.
---
Also it looks good!!  Love the drawing
---
Yep i know it drops next week.thank you!!!
---
I agree! You can see me three tap the hacker with my Jade Rabbit at one point, if it was momentum control he would have died from one shot.

They should make a remaster of d1
---
I really like the slight shading.  :)
---
They‚Äôre downgrading an entire subclasses jump in order to buff one branch. Plus removing the melees damage ability. Warlocks are getting nerfed while everyone else is getting new ways to kill more efficiently.
---

Is that leg slot?

Are you trying to tell me the red war was an inside job? As funny as the resulting memes would be, I can't tolerate Shaxx being involved in that nonsense.

Yes yes yes yes

Riven Cheese is still a thing?

im always using this build in comp with my demolitionist austringer, don't hate me tho.

It‚Äôs pretty clean

i 100% guarantee i will absolutely destroy you in a 1v1

I think everyone wants to win dude, I have had plenty of matches where it was 3 nothing to them and somehow my team won, it would have been way harder if one person left, but, it would be hilarious if we win after a guy bails, as they just lost glory for nothing, don't be that guy dude
---
definitely the words I utter when I huck a Nova Bomb
---
Well the thing is invaders can see where you are and how many motes you have, also they have an overshield. I recommend to go invade once on gambit so you can see how it's like and how people try to avoid you. I found out like that that what gambit needs is: 1. Your favorite weapon. 2. A long range weapon. 3. Heavy ammo should be reserved for the invader.
---
At 980 it‚Äôs not a one-shot, unfortunately. The dodge-invis ability on night stalker is too useful where you need to evade and relocate.
---
#^^^^YOU ^^^DIDN'T ^^THROW ^ENOUGH GRENADES!
---
The part I hate wearing s full collector set and asshats dont let you grab 20
---
I honestly wouldn't bother anymore.
---
Yes, you will miss out on some rewards and the season pass exclusive loot, but you would need to invest heavy amounts of time (easily 6+ hours per day) to finish the season pass with the time left and all that's going to do is burn you out.

I laugh maniacally as the arcs of electricity course over my warlock and feed death into my gun. 
---
‚ÄúYou poor bastards.‚Äù
---
Right they didnt bother with all the rest just that 1 you needed for a large ugh
---
Good question! I actually don‚Äôt know. I will try to buy twice today, for science üë®üèª‚Äçüî¨
---
Yup - Long Shadow
---
If the nine didn't intervene I doubt the attack on the city would go well for them if they even made it there

He was, for less than a day and then he got unbanned

One way you can improve your individual gun skill is by playing a bunch of Rumble. Nobody there to help you, you will have to land your shots. Also no team shooting means your 1v1s are gonna be a lot more fair, which is what I personally enjoy the most. Other than that just take it easy, dont stress yourself out and try to have fun with it. Also also, try swapping your loadout around a bunch, dont just play with what's 'meta', instead try to find a setup that you enjoy and click with. Who knows, you might be a bow god and not realize it since nobody recommends bows in the first place! Don't discard any option until you're sure you dislike it, and dont force yourself to adopt a play style you're not comfortable with.

I‚Äôve played a lot of shooters and I have gotten to 5500 and my best advice other then practice aim in csgo workshop or something (if u want) is the positioning is key if you have a shotgun don‚Äôt play large open lanes if your nova bombing then play close corners,same  with titan melee and only engage in gunfights u can if you can‚Äôt win run back to team or just stay with a team member and team shot

Ok i will try checking

Really sucks, like I went through getting good armor for this and it's a waste because I'm playing with morons with no situational awareness
---
Yes but the ETA to find a team using it is almost an hour. Everyone either has the full stack or is using the LFG from the app
---
Ok but I get confused, is the roll I can't get or is the actual weapon?
---
So for example could I get the same weapon but with another roll?
---
That makes no sense at all. You are so mad you can‚Äôt even construct basic sentences haha
---
Yea, let's make it possible for people to run Izanagi **and** Divinity.
---
^(/s)
---
Hunters are going to be OP with that Metal Tube
---
Give me back my No land beyond!
---
Man, the Invective was my first ever exo I got.

---
You cannot get the weapon from collections at all, need to farm it from the appropriate location or activities
---
Yep just map knowledge, but if you are playing gambit P the sentry armour perks allow them to highlight you to their whole team as long as they saw you, even for 0.5 seconds
---
Looks kind of baller. I wish they made a vanguard ritual sniper with the same model.
---
Check his steam profile comments
---
From down read up
---
Your fate will be decided by the council...
---
PL if you somehow completed the catalyst.
---
And JR if not. Jade Rabbit has not aim assist if I remember correctly tho.
---
Sorry but these are all heavy weapons
---
You can tell i dont play warlock.
---
Hahaha
---
Hopefully this rwplaces fusion rifles
---
I have over 400 games of Gambit 10,000 motes deposited, and 168 army of one medals I'm sorry to say but that's just Gambit being Gambit save your super for the invader that's all I can recommend
---
Works better with crest of alpha lupi since it grants health on shield placement. You should try it before arc battery goes away.
---
ooohh trust me. Your kd will only get worse the more u play because u'll get better opponents the more u play. When i first started i had a 1.8kd and now 1 month later im sitting at 1.2
---
Send me a message and I can help with that, have an active clan that runs raids, strikes, gambit and crucible and helps with exotic weapon quests
---
I didn‚Äôt know u could shoot the centre... I always went around it
---
We get it, you have a job. Congratulations?
---
Hard disagree, I think this season's set looks fantastic. Sure the wolf hood was cool but imo it's the only memorable piece out of that collection.
---
No, we have the loop at home.
---
Im stuck in legend III... one day
---
*you're*
---
I would do the following;
---
1. Leviathan. Everyone has it, it's a good spin on learning mechanics and what matters, loadouts aren't as limited.
---
2. Scourge of the Past: Still done insanely quick once experienced, needs more limited loadouts to work well and is a tiny bit harder - but not "hard" still. If you did Leviathan with no issues, the mechanics here won't be an issue either.
---
3. Last Wish: Once you can run SoTP well, you can check for a Last Wish group. Everything is more stressful in comparison, but the rewards are also better and the whole raid feels a bit more "finished". You also learn about cheeses and secrets eventually.
---
4. Garden of Salvation: Once you are 940/950+ you can try the garden. It's fairly easy to do, but there's more situations where you can't just rely on your team and need to be able to hold yourself up. The raid exotic quest delivers a pretty nice moral boost however.
---
It *should* be retroactive now since you hit it while already having the quest, but I‚Äôm not 100% sure. I know they changed certain weapons to be retroactive, but not sure if they changed them all.
---
If by ‚Äònerfed to the ground‚Äô you mean ‚Äòfixed to not being stupidly broken‚Äô, then yes.
---
It was an exotic back in the first Destiny it‚Äôs not in D2 currently
---
You never shot the middle of the shield?
---
Bungie is having a baby
---
Full armor would have been wasted on archers in battle because they aren't front line fighters, and only knights really wore full armor. It was too expensive for anyone else. It does affect physical movement soeed, sure, but it doesn't have any real hindrance on your arm and back muscles, which are all you need to draw a bow. It affects your accuracy more than your speed, because you tire faster. 
---
Besides all this, the only class in destiny that uses heavy armor at all are the titans, who it clearly doesn't affect at all given that they have no speed or movement penalty compared to warlocks and hunters.
---
Wonder what the masterwork of the advanced brush would do?
---
Man I'm gonna clean house!
---
I thought the tether doesn't even open if you don't get 30?
---
I's loves to player killings but wow thing much scenery's all time
---
Destiny 1 servers are still running?
---
‚ÄúYou spin me right round baby right round, like a record baby right round right round...‚Äù
---
Sometimes Destiny lore feels like the writers at Bungie made HALO:CE not expecting to make a series out of it then were like oh fuck we could have made this so much cooler. Like the Cabal is the covenant, the hive is the flood, the Vex are the forerunner robots. There's obviously enough differences to make distinctions but they fill more or less the same roles in each universe.
---
Metal telescopic tube is basically No Land Beyond
---
Either for completing all challenges or boss's challenge.
---
Wtf, I...I never knew. Is this real? I played the game since destiny 1 alpha.
---
Thats probably my favorite story ftom destiny 2 simply because bungie actually decided to ginish the story instead of leaving us on vague cliffhangars
---
Doubt. It's not even on steamdb as a change.
---
Aren't there 5 bosses and 3 can drop the shotgun?
---
You make a valid point. I personally found vex offensive boring after the first couple of times, so I was really hoping the final assault was going to spice things up. Lots of people tend to look at one bad thing and make it the topic of discussion, but we tend to forget all the good stuff this game has. I'm guilty for falling into that trap myself.
---
Rise of iron is my favorite expansion so when they said it was going to be RoI levels of content I was freaking hyped, but this season just feels slow. The only thing that kept me playing was finally getting my not forgotten last week, and now I don't know what to play. I'll probably play Minecraft until the next season or something.
---
300+ hours on destiny 2
---
And i didn't know you had to shoot the middle of the shield to break it
---
Thanks for this
---
Really? Your welcome ü§ó
---
Use blind well in Corrupted strike for Edgwise, play normal gambit for Exit Strategy, and do kill farm for Randys
---
*As a main in Hand Cannons. This is very accurate*
---
Bring back the iron temple
---
I've found Jade Rabbit to hit that sweet spot for me in D2.  For some reason the cadence of Mida isn't something I'm used to maybe I just need more practice.
---
It‚Äôs time to kick gum and chew ass....
---
And I‚Äôm all out of ass -Dick Kickem
---
I'm usually chasing precision kills. But the Cerberus is making me think twice.
---
It was nerfed to the ground in a sense. 
---
D1 had a very bad problem where 1-3 weapons were so dominantly meta that nothing else was useable. Look at the thorn for an example, during this time the only other used exotics were hawk moon and last word and hawk moon was like a worse thorn since it couldn‚Äôt consistently 2 tap. 
---
It wasn‚Äôt nerfed into the ground in a term of usability, but it was nerfed into being unusable by no longer being the strongest option
---
Welcome to the real grind
---
https://steamcommunity.com/id/gwapp/inventory/#1085660 mine link
---
Finally, some good warlock armor
---
Wish they had eyasluna
---
I got it too. Anyone know when it may be back up? Or what the cause of it was, at least?
---
The point here is that, while you need to use a specific weapon type (shotguns) to effectively counter a titan ability, you don't have to do the same for hunters/warlocks.
---
I can usually manage well against them because I tend to fight at mid-range and I rarely go melee on my hunter, but I shouldn't be limited to range only/using a shotgun when playing against a specific class.  If a hunter and a titan or a warlock and a titan meet with full health, inside melee range, the titan will almost always win, and will draw with a hunter or warlock using a shotgun most of the remainder.
---
It literally had a faster kill time than a machine gun
---
Was also good for the phogoth nf because you could just sit outside of the door and ruin his day real quick...
---
You and me both.
---
I spent so much time trying to get a god roll for this.
---
Atleast your sibling plays video games. My sister does tik toks and goes to parties
---
Correct. There are basically are two different bosses that drop all weapons.
---
THAT'S SO TRUE XD
---
Next season. It's in TWAB.
---
it was a fucking great gun. my first exotic
---
Took around 60 completions to get all 3.
---
It's fine now, and even when the new season starts it'll be one of the best.  The change means it requires a little bit of actual effort to shred enemies as opposed to just spraying and getting kills.
---
I‚Äôm confused by that first bit. Wife‚Äôs boyfriend.... sets off alarm bells in my head but you be you guardian.
---
wow i was grinding vex offensive for Offensive Expert/Sharpshooter thinking i was close... this just killed any hope i had of getting the title
---
"I'll fuckin do it again, too." - Punchy boi
---
Yeah, it does have a Halo feel to it at times though it is a different game altogether
---
ahh thanks for the clarification!
---
750?  Damn... I'm still running with 45's.
---
That's amazing!
---
After you reach 900 you can increase your power with ‚Äúpowerful gear‚Äù and ‚Äúpinnacle gear‚Äù awards. You get them from weakly tasks for vendors (for example 8 bounties from Banshee-44). ‚ÄúPowerful gear‚Äù stops working on 950. After that you can only boost by ‚ÄúPinnacle gear‚Äù which you get from hardest tasks and can get you to 960
---
No the Gjally was broken. Im pretty sure it was very possible to kill a team of 6 where the actual shot only hits 2 and the trackers did the rest. Hell it could literally take anything out in a few shots. Add heavy synthesis into the mix and it‚Äôs hilariously broken
---
They call it "fun police" . I call it "karmic justice". Payback for all the non-Mayhem weeks, when I have to venture into PvP for quest-related "mandatory workplace fun". 
---
 
---
The worst part: I don't even care if I get kills. I just like leaving tethers all over the place for the other team to stumble into.
---
Would it be Vex or Suros?
---
The game was about 3 years so imagine you started playing at the beginning of D2, D3 would be coming out pretty soon.
---
D2 break for everyone this weekend  ... go get some air &amp; sun  \^\^
---
But the only difference is that the blades are not under the wrists, but semantics.
---
That was my favorite activity. I‚Äôd spend hours cheesing nightfalls solo purely because I found it fun. Even though it would have been way easier and faster to find a group. Getting kicked to orbit if you fuck up made the stakes way higher and it taught me everything about the strike/nightfall.
---
?
---
Looks more like a trace rifle.
---
Ok
---
Its exotic perk is you can tack it off and whip things with it
---
You bought it for silver?
---
I'm gonna say, as nice as it is, I still would prefer it not done.  Good chance it'll take away from future content. Also D1 is still a huge game built over years, it wouldn't be something that could be done in a week or month even.
---
Yeah that didn‚Äôt sound right lol. Destiny 1 and destiny 2 existed for the same amount of time right now in year 3. Because destiny 1 lasted 3 years and destiny 2 just hit its 3rd year with the launch of shadowkeep.
---
that's a great tip! I'm at 4200 glory been stuck there a while now and when I get clan mates to play with they rage out pretty quickly, it's hard lesson to learn remaining calm while getting erentil and tbagged for the umpteenth time lol
---
and no matter how cool i think I am using lunas howl, sometimes goin to recluse to spank some overly aggressive opponents is a great idea lol (using meta weapons)
---
Never downvoted so friggen fast üòÇ
---
Maybe mark it as /s?
---
It's the same in D2 unless you throw backup mag on everything
---
YES!
---
Sorry if this is the wrong spot to post.  I'm new to destiny on the pc and am lacking skill in crucible right now... im.tryibg to farm for lunas and the recluse (need competitive fabled). Which guns would you guys suggest or have had good luck with in competitive?
---
I feel and know your pain.
---
Sawwy for party rockin'
---
[Hadley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeUXktsSSS8) downloaded a virus.
---
I think my buddy who is really into this stuff said that this is deff around the black Forrest or something in Germany/ Russia
---
I don‚Äôt know, I just took it all down. Better to just not have it.
---
Also... Rip console users. As if there wasn't enough load time and reasons to lag.  Inventories just cluttered with even MORE things from D1.
---
It depends, if you want a good story forsaken, but if you want to not play catch up then choose shadowkeep
---
Man I respect your enthusiasm but I gotta tell ya, I *fucking* hate people who use suppressor grenades in crucible. I won't shit on you for being a dad and all but I figured you should know how it makes others feel
---
Something to counter the phalanx shield. "Antibarrier" shots for auto rifles and hand cannons.
---
*sad guardian noises*
---
I remember that and I loved LW!!!!!!
---
As The Great Titan Thanos once said, I dont even know who you are
---
An excellent response
---
There's a new player faq somewhere on the about section I believe. If you are under 900 still, playing strikes or crucible will be the fastest level up. Up to that point everything will give you upgrades, so you just want something that gives you plenty of rewards. Gambit gives you stuff, but its time to reward ratio isn't good if you are just trying to level up.
---
Once you hit 900 you'll get a quest completion and it will tell you that from 900 on, only prime engrams, powerful rewards, and pinnacle rewards will level you up. It will slow down immensely here. Prime engrams can be randomly found, and they'll be an upgrade for you, but they aren't super common. Powerful rewards are mostly from weekly challenges, like the 5 nightfalls, or the crucible matches completed. Pinnacles have few sources, the new raid, iron banner bounties, and the final pit of heresy chest. 
---
Once you hit 900, just focus on playing a lot and youll get there eventually. If you have the people for a raid group awesome, if not, start looking into what most people bring into raids. Oftentimes, random groups wont bring in newer players unless they have specific weapons. I've heard the sniper izanagis burden is pretty much a requirement for most groups.
---
Everything can be done in a single day, but those emblems, yeah have fun
---
Yeah...too many meme posts with everyone copying the same image to meme with.
---
To me the meme posts are just low tier shitposting by people who actually think reddit karma means something.
---
saaaaammmeeee
---
I got Vex on my first run too. But faithbringer, goddamn. It was at least 50+ runs before I finally got it to drop
---
Blind well, 2nd or 3rd tier.
---
EVERYTHING IS SOLD OUT
---
WHY
---
Agreed.  If you don't have any additional info, keep scrolling.  Instead, they spam on every single post to check the twitter, which says literally nothing but corporate bs, and this dude actually has the audacity to make a post attacking anyone that would like more than "servers are down, were investigating".
---
your family is fkn rich
---
Fuck! me too!! A fellow Guardian of distinction, I tip my hat to you Sir!üòä
---
RIP people who are playing the game for the first time too. Imagine buying Destiny on sale without really reading up about it and seeing a massive 180+ GB download size.
---
Really? I'll have to go check that out later.
---
I was just trying to make a joke, and obviously it wasn‚Äôt funny. Sorry for offending you and waisting your time. 
---
I know online games have issues, I‚Äôve been with destiny since D1. I‚Äôm not mad about the server issues or anything either. 
---
Just again, Sorry.
---
WHY.. Now, why would the robot fairy NOT win?
---
The most messed up thing is I had the ornament for the Icebreaker and still didn‚Äôt get the gun
---
I miss the Ice Braker :(
---
The accuracy in representation of the characters is ::italianChefKiss::
---
Looks like the car from The Last Starfighter.
---
My next go too load out! Aaaah memories!!üòçüòçüòçüòç
---
yep
---
just make it that its the same stuff from D2
---
3 abilities + super
---
and D2 ghost voice
---
god i hate the 1st one
---
Yes sir. Telling this sub to harass this individual because he reposts/steals memes. Pretty scummy on both ends
---
Yup tapir now though
---
I want a death tracker emblem for this and/or misadventure
---
heloo what sniper rifle is that?
---
Thank you. I'm 21 polys.
---
YEEEES WARDCLIFF COIL!!!
---
I keep seeing legend is easy and then these posts. So confused on where it stands this season for most people.
---
I'm at season rank 112. I need the next season to drop now. Boooored.
---
Ah fuck that, and fuck you for being part of the problem(love you though don't be mad at me)
---
We are moving closer to a resolution.
---
When I saw this post I exhaled more than a usual post so thank you for allowed me to feel some form of happiness before I go back to an evening of revision
---
oh god oh fuck
---
Yes I can‚Äôt wait for it to be even more useless than the one we already have in PVE
---
I was trying to get to 100 am at 57 so I was kind of grinding
---
How about tapir?
---
Black Friday and stadia both I think
---
Ahhh I see, thanks for the tip!
---
yeah it is, two wrongs don't make a right.
---
*they make a wwrroonngg*
---
This looks like an Adult Swim animation.
---
I recommend Huckleberry

You may be the bigger dick sir....

Gentleman Vagabond
---
That triumph is a problem to me too
---
Googo thinkn tehy can port mirror my Bungo servers? OOH NO, GOOGO! Nuh uh!
---
No problem. Hmu if u want to play some day. Hope u have a beautifull evening &lt;3
---
That's a relief. I was really worried.
---
What if they copied Borderlands and setup slot machines in the tower but they take Legendary Shards with a chance of getting old ornaments.
---
Beautiful
---
I sent you a direct message so as not to takeaway from your original thread
---
Imagine of the mythoclyst was a vex offensive exotic that dropped for everyone later on like ThunderLord. Vex Offensive would‚Äôve actually had a cool ending.
---
at least they didn't buff blade barrage..
---
*screams in felwinters lie*
---
had to do the same.. strong disagree.. nothing like seeing the happiness fall from the eyes of the tethered
---
What did you prefer to do for progress?
---
r/punpatrol No...no...this is...too much. I need BACKUP!!!
---
Having finished The Red War and Curse of Osiris, what should I be doing now? I'm trying to do the Warmind quests, but it seems like a short quest? What then?
---
The warlock hate from the developers themselves is a bit painful sometimes
---
Sweet üëç thanks
---
I doubt momentum control returns this season.
---
I used The Colony and Fighting Lion.
---
Those two GLs with some grenade mods make the grind almost non existant. I kind of pissed off some randoms using them because I was killing everything which I imagine made their bounty grinds harder lol.
---
I got exit strategy and the living vestige emblem while I was getting the last test I needed for my dredgen
---
Because it's Ikora?
---
Hey, do you have any advice for Spear of the Fore? That's the one I'm nervous about.
---
Like, it's not only a matter of finding some friends to do it with, if my friends aren't high enough level- or if *I'm* not. It seems like strategies are very different from regular nightfalls to do the 980. I'm at something like 969 LL myself, highest out of any of my friends, and I still get the red sword thing next to enemy healthbars. Even with two of us with anti-barrier weapons, we can't take out a champion without using supers or heavy ammo. Are there any specific guns that we should be using? Damage numbers are so high that I feel like Recluse isn't worth it, because I have to get too close. I know Izanagi's is good but none of my friends are pursuing that questline and I can't beat the harder version of the Pyramidion strike no-deaths solo.
---
I went in with a 4 stack. We did tether first time, then BB second, goldengun 3rd and finally middle tree arc staff! We all had tractor canon equipped üòÇ
---
The Traveler its closer
---
There is one week left that it could Appear in, the second to last week
---
why that man making 2d cars, he knows we live with all 3 d's
---
its a joke because xur sold the riskrunner the last two weeks already
---
That‚Äôs the joke
---
Next week on eververse for only 1500 silver
---
It‚Äôs going to be really good with max strength and the assassins cowl
---
What platform you on?
---
I got flashbacks of Gambit normal by clicking on this meme.
---
There were plenty of moments in destiny history where they may have deserved this, but this season is not one of them lol
---
Use Fighting Lion as your primary weapon. When loading into a strike or one of the selective 750 Nightfalls  that starts you off in a patrol zone, B-line it to the nearest lost sector and keep running it for kills. This will keep you from competing with others throughout the strike for kills and give you more time on your progress.
---
Changing the loadout in console.
---
Oh hey same for hunters.... wait, we just get shitty ones that do useless things instead of the same
---
Suppressor grenades in mayhem?! You are pure evil guardian
---
Next week in the eververse for only 1500 silver
---
Just brilliant! Haha!
---
Hahahaha it's the little things in life my friend.
---
"single evolving world" working out pretty well
---
love it
---
A tip I want to add to this comment if people didn't know. Get double kills in 1 life with fusions, fastest way for medals for Randy's. Got me 5-9% every match in IB the first time it came around.
---
Okay I'm sorry I'm old but I've seen memes like this and I just don't get it.
---
Basically yeah next to BB and FoH
---
Yes I've read those hypothesis too, if confirmed that would just put Google  offices under siege by a horde of angry OEM striker titans....
---
Most likely some really complicated packet manipulation. I doubt an aimbot.  
---
It's certainly not public and is definitely privateware.
---
This!
---
ya got me kid
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
fuck
---
I want my No Land Beyond back simply cause it was the coolest looking IMO. Looks like something they would have found in the Golden Age
---
Ohhh. But i dont see us being on queue or anything
---
If you think me 1 person who is calling you out is "working" then I don't even know anymore your supposed to get bungies attention and my support so it's seems like your doing the opposite buddy
---
I miss two shots to kill on the fastest rate of fire handy in the game
---
*Nelvin joins fire team.* 
---
One wipe. 
---
*Nelvin leaves fireteam.*
---
Thats what this post is for. I agree &lt;3
---
one time I throwed and it flew right above the forge thing itself
---
One person? Pshh I have the most comments from any post about the servers lol.
---
I‚Äôm guessing the influx of new players caused something to crash. Idk though
---
UNLIMITED POWERRRR
---
M√∂≈•es, br√∂the≈ï.
---
Oh man that was my first drop!
---
I‚Äôm not the best at crucible, but I can get first place on my team like a sixth of the time ;)
---
My advice is to just play a lot and try to learn from your mistakes. The never made a conscious effort to get better at the crucible, but over time I‚Äôve just developed a feeling for when I‚Äôm in danger and when I can get the drop on the enemy team. You‚Äôll learn which places on the map people usually go to and when they usually go there and you‚Äôll be able to anticipate when you‚Äôre running into the enemy team before you see them and you turn around or get read to defend your position.
---
Wait you‚Äôre no u/lord-Dio-Brando
---
Im still fairly getting into the grind (only 920 with the artifact power 915 w/out) but what guns are those?
---
Nah, it would rather be Solar middle hunter tree before nerf. Remember that one?
---
They don't work just as much as your reading, considering you weren't able to notice I corrected it in the description since I can't edit the caption.

We were getting contacting errors and disconnects around 7am EST while running a strike. Took about an hour to finally finish it with the disconnects.
---
Yeah, still is my favourite strike tbf. Tried soloing Pit of Heresy recently and it really reminded me of back then. My friend used to lend me his account to do nightfalls on because he didn't have much time to play and we were always raiding when he did get on. Miss those days.
---
And most are shitting on you lol

At this point, I'm not even going to be able to play until monday...

I don‚Äôt think you understand the power of a reaction. None of these comments matter. That fact that you‚Äôre adding to the comments and making it popular do lol. Watch me work son

It was a question. Do you expect questions to fix servers now?
---
The invective with its weapon ornament was just awesome... weapons that regenerate their own ammunition too broken for bungie just as ammo synthesis is ‚Äútoo taxing‚Äù for ghost /s
---
It is new to D2

And I cant, upgraded to pc a WHILE back.

I came to destiny too late to see that, I'll have to ask my clan mates to tell me some stories.

Nice of you to point out an analogy that highlights your area of expertise and its distinction from one that actually concerns the administration of  networked systems.
---
Your very initial statement is an unadulterated assumption, based on more assumptions. Nowhere have I ever encountered major system fault resolution being is standardised to 10mins. Even for a cloud or VPS service, offloading is used to mitigate the issue, and then the real fault correction begins. 
---
I'm disappointed that another engineer claims to know what he/she doesn't know, it should have been the first f\*\*\*ing thing drilled out of you.

No

Ok buddy Pat yourself on the back boomer

Oh so it wasn¬¥t just me, well that sucks but like you said shit happens.

Hope they¬¥ll fix it soon.

Should probably make the music louder and more annoying if that is possible.
---
Stadia just broke.
---
Good so I am in the right place! Lol! It's one thing I have NEVER understood with Bungie. Arguably some of the best lore in the business and yet their story continuity is complete and utter shit. I mean hello, Rasputin? Hive building a big ass thing on the freaking moon and nothing?! Honestly main reason I stay subscribed to the Destiny subs is just hoping I'll hear cool updates to the story, but yeah, nope. :(
---
Exactly everyone is suddenly an expert developer, its good to have some downtime and get a few other things done
---
Unban
---
Borealis is a very good thing to look out for, especially in Matchgame nightfalls. Hardlight does exist, but you're better off using a laser pointer in a hall of mirrors to blind enemies than use that assault rifle to kill enemies.
---
People are so fucking sensitive now lol. Anything that inconveniences them in the slightest way for the smallest amount of time will have them grabbing their pitch forks and trying to boycott or slam someone.
---
Bungie has been amazing to its community since halo 1. And even before that.... god forbid one bad things happens to the servers üò§

The armors, 100% yes, they need a lot of work (as they're actually ripped from the 3d model viewer in the app) but the weapons are presented in high res and often require minimal treatment.
---
Can you imagine the tower as a crucible map? one team starts in black armory and the other starts in the hangar.

I looked at this 6 hours ago and my Spanish teacher took away my phone (we weren‚Äôt doing anything)

Dude. Why even comment?

Asking myself same question - from what I have read buying Forsaken opens up a lot of content with quests weapons and etc 
---
Considering getting Forsaken and season pass but would like to hear community

All I know is us zoomers are gonna outlive y'all dumbasses so whatever you think your doing won't matter in the long run buddy

I saw the deleted comment. Throwing around gay slurs online in 2020 like a kid on the playground can get your life ruined. That literally lets me know all I need to know about you.
---
That'll teach you not to skip school, youngster!! :D
---
Umm no? Right before Shadowkeep launched Bungie said that the Year 2 Annual Pass would come free with Forsaken. The Year 3 Annual Pass only comes with the Digital Deluxe Edition of Shadowkeep
---
Probably stadia, but who knows maybe we will find out soon
---
Honestly, a space car for a ship could be interesting. Bungie could probably design it into something interesting and plausible.
---
The Pocket infinity after the fusion rifle buff....

oh lawd he L    O     N     G

God speed, brother.
---
I thought that's how this worked. You post and we comment.  Am I wrong?

It taught Bungie too, that‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt have sniper nests and hidey holes at the boss anymore. Rip nexus and phogoth.

I was actually able to get in and play a crucible match an hour ago and then the servers went down again.

Sorry, your submission has been automatically removed.

It appears you are asking a question about Destiny 2 error codes or a bug.

We suggest Google searching your error code for more information about what you might be experiencing, or posting in /r/DestinyTechSupport
---
Well, to be fair Bungie did say "That we would see how it impact the coming of the next season". But as someone above me mentioned, it is sadly not worth the bother. If you want for the community to farm an activity, then don't make it boring.  
---
And keep in mind, i actually like vex offensive, but the final assault is a joke.
---
My connection only breaks when I open Xur‚Äôs inventory

We could have bought all the seal pins, the grimores and the cooking books on amazon

As a fellow 45yo, this gives me hope, lol. My son got me into d2 around a year ago and haven't stopped playing since, but I'm really, really bad in pvp! Kudos to you, buddy! Very well done!

For something this long it must be a hardware issue

Lol I was just going to say stadia broke it self
---
It‚Äôs not a destiny logo
---
You do not have to go to Spider any more, the Black Armory quests were all streamlined in the New Light update. You just have to complete the New Light intro quest and talk to Ada-1.
---
If you are talking about the shapes of the sparrows then yes, but I‚Äôm talking about the colors and designs. Most d2 sparrows just have shaders on them that are already in the game instead of having unique colors.
---
Frickin stadia... Frickin everything up
---
I'm not too worried there's only 8 of us but it may happen to anyone. we still keep getting disconnected however.
---
Good luck. Out of 5 attempts, I‚Äôve made it to Xur twice before getting the Weasel error code.
---
Only 1500?? An absolute steal!
---
I actually agree with you. And if Im right, I dont know for how long we should be killing the poor thing. It would be cool, but they can't expect that people will enjoy an activity without a clear reward or reason that will MAYBE pay off in a month or so. Cool idea, poorly implemented
---
Oh ok, thanks :)
---
Would still loose a 1v1 with a thrall due to reload.
---
Lmao I remember the grind for hush rushing to the bank everytime I heard that just for that 1% lol
---
It‚Äôs not like Bungie had 5+ years to get their shit together or anything.
---
Never said anything about variety. D1 sparrows had their own unique colors, while d2 sparrows have shaders on them.
---
Hunters/the colony üòÇüò±

Yes, the servers are very unstable and things aren't loading properly. Relax, just wait.

It struck me that the darkness is the exact opposite of the traveler. Asymmetrical, angular and dark. 
---
While Rasputin is kind of like a man-made traveler, but a manufactured shape rather than the organic sphere.

Yeah it's a bug

Keep grinding xp to get all the season pass stuff
---
Keep getting weasel
---
Bungie Help is so vague...says it could be a ban.
---
How do so many errors pop up with a connectivity issue?
---
They literally took it out the game for a while because it was powerful?
---
Possibly. I‚Äôve heard people talking about how Stadia is the problem
---
I've never had to wait more than a minute or two to matchmake anything in the entire game since launch other than Iron Banner when it hits 11/12 players. I do play at West coast peak times mostly, but I wonder why it varies so much for other people?
---
Yeah the servers are offline again ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
No I can't. It says I still need like 200,000 more xp
---
Bungie didn‚Äôt invent skulls
---
Are the servers down? I have been having hella trouble connecting...that could explain it
---
Somebody has never seen pre-nerf blackhammer
---
Yeah I remember. Wasn't that a while ago tho? I meant recently.
---
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
---
Nah, they just fucked something up during the Google Stadia launch.

He's not.  Wardcliff, OEM, Ophidia Spathe, and I didn't see what the warlock armor was.

So what happens endgame when you have every exotic possible? What do exotic engrams give you?
---
And aren't Xur's exotic engrams, and the ones you get from season leveling up, the same?
---
The weekly challenge from Gunsmith "complete 8 gunsmith bounties"? You simply do 8 bounties from him during the week and you get powerful gear from him (powerful gear is needed to advance your power from 900 to 950, regular drops will no longer be enough). Other vendors have the same challenge as well, encouraging you to do a variety of stuff during the week.
---
Most warlock exotics suck ass, are too niche to be useful, and virtually all of them are completely worthless in PvP  
---
Also after seeing the planned changes for solar classes, I got to love how titan and hunter get more power in their class and warlock gets a TECHNICALLY nerfed (but still feels the same) airborne subclass.  
---
Feels amazing to be a warlock
---
tangled shore stuff
---
My man DeeJ on the ledge and shit
---
The event in sorrows harbor would be good as well.
---
I only PvP in destiny, and I'm a pretty old player (even tho I gave the game a big break)
---
And from time to time just like 1 year ago  I think if I should buy Forsaken or not, and honestly I at this point I probably should, but it's not gonna be for the exotics, it's gonna be to support the devs.
---
The reason why I don't care about exotics is that even without forsaken I find myself having way too many builds to try ant never sticking with one, no matter the class.
---
For titans for example the next build I wanna try is max discipline + armamentarium + the subclass that already gives you 2 grenades, just so I can throw 3 at people, if I can't kill them with that I'm the worst player ever.
---
EDZ, bear whisper wind cove, I think.

There is a great YouTube channel with a *loremaster* called ‚Äúmy name is byf‚Äù on YouTube he has a couple videos out on the story of destiny so far as well as general lore videos so you can learn to understand what you‚Äôre actually doing because there is honestly quite a bit going on which is why it‚Äôs very easy to get overwhelmed 
---
Essentially you can do whatever you want and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs amazing about destiny to me , you can choose your experience obviously you can do everything if you want or you can just play what is fun for you !!
---
I don't know how hunters manage to legitimately bitch when warlocks have to sit around and watch the other two classes have fun while we get to "fly a bit better"  
---
Seriously.
---
I find funny Xur starts selling OEM just after I posted this lol
---
Bottom tree golden gun with celestial nighthawk for unstoppable champions, and izanagi‚Äôs burden for Barrier champions. Ark Energy or heavy weapons and you should be good.
---
70 cold fusion medals.
---
No. Microsoft paid Bungee to kill the servers right after Stadia launch to kill it. I one-up your conspiracy.
---
It's been like this all day for free players and non free players. It's just a game, relax.
---
I would like to see warlocks return to the meta, Sadly the bottom three dawnblade nerf does not helpüòì

[A new player guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1878973112) I cannot emphasize that first part enough, to **start with the Red War campaign.** Steam has a lot of good guides, since you could not put D2 guides on steam until October 1, so they are all pretty up to date. 
---
I didn't play D1, and it isn't really essential to understand what's going on unless you want to get into the lore. There are a wide variety of summary videos, since D1 was a console exclusive, so every PC player wanted some sort of summary video.

when does it 1 hit kill ?

Yea, as a super
---
They give you duplicates if you have everything they can give you. 
---
I don't know if Xur's engrams and the season rank up engrams are the same, as I have every exotic so I just get duplicates.

Hmm I figured it would. My bad

I‚Äôd recommend doing all the old campaign missions if you have forsaken do that as well. You‚Äôll learn some of the story and level up fast.
---
But at least you have the CHANCE to do it.  
---
Warlocks continuously just get shit on every time they change anything. It's fucking disgusting that a game design team just throws an entire class on the ground while sucking off the other two.
---
All right cool thanks. I just really want huckleberry. Rigit now on the shop is some exotic rocket launcher that I don't care for, but I bought it anyway to get one step closer to Huckleberry
---
The reverse is:
---
Kill something with primary or secondary
---
Swap to FL and fire
---
Damage(?) or kill something with FL
---
FL procs Thin the Herd to load 1 into the breach and you can fire again
---
Since FL only holds one grenade you can only proc Thin the herd when its empty.
---
Too soon man too soon
---
It is and always has been a mess because the game connects the PvE/PvP. Nothing ever sticks.
---
Thank you for this.
---
Yeah frick em for keeping us posted!
---
Your username tho ha
---
Yup. Warlock is the PvE class... but does PvE about on par with the other two.
---
Well, at least there are a few great ones and a number of good-but-outclassed ones... most of which shine in PvE (Nezareck's Sin for example)
---
This. If you can manage to kill the 3 guardians after they lost all their lives for the round you will get flooded with kill medals, this is how i got mine done in a few survival sessions. Ran a multi tool/ lunas howl. Good luck guardians!

I would rather them keep it down until its legitimately fixed than resort to the BS queue stuff again.

Not to mention that my queue number randomly increases...

Why is my spot in queue not going down. It's stayed at 8050 for the longest time.
---
Ahh my second exotic, after ice breaker form nightfall.
---
The agony.. I‚Äôm still waiting
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ far out
---
Handheld supernova is not an excuse for warlocks to have shit melee skills that all require kills to even do anything special, handheld supernova is just a better grenade while we have virtually no options otherwise  
---
Axion is too weak, Scatter Grenade is tiny and never hits things, arc bolt is axion but storm, stormcall is subject to rng half the time, fusion nade has the WORST magnetic attach I've ever seen, Solar bolt is axion and arc bolt but solar.  
---
Pulse is literally the only useable grenade for warlocks, so handheld supernova being a useful grenade ability that CONSUMES THE GRENADE AND ISN'T ALWAYS A ONE SHOT does not mean warlock now magically has the same treatment as hunters or titans.   
---
Half the warlock players just have Stockholm syndrome from being abused by bungie for so long
---
I could definitely see this in game with a Siva color scheme and exotic quest. We got Outbreak again after all
---
I was 6000 in line took about 17 mins to get in
---
Well think of the gun xenophage except instead of a guardian thats been turned into a bug cause of some hive magic they just put a reaaaaaaaly stressed out iguana in there.
---
i think you missed the point

Time to consider dedicated servers Bungie!
---
The watermark oh no
---
What emote is that?
---
nice watermark
---
No problem, I don't know what possessed me to jump around on that railing but once my camera angle glitched it was like "oh yeah this game is gorgeous"
---
The title also disappears at the end of the season if you haven‚Äòt finished it (including ritual weapons). You will still be able to earn the weapons (and other non season exclusive triumphs) but they won‚Äôt count towards the seal/title after the end of the season.

I just want to get the engram from Xur
---
Amen to that, I've been grinding for the breakneck for like the past week and every other game when I get back home from work I'm facing a clan but in the early morning I'm getting somewhere between 15 to 20 guardians killed. Like I hardly get a match where both sides are putting in a real effort at the same time.

---
Hunters have never had a one shot ability so this is good. Look at titans with bottom tree and thunder coil/shoulder charge w/ skull fort or warlocks with handheld supernova. At least hunter‚Äôs one shot ability takes a Crit to kill
---
I mainly played Destiny for PvP and after a ton of Overwatch just came back... for the PvP.

But if you want PvP and didn't, personally, like the PvP in D1 then you probably wouldn't care for D2's either.

Well when its the best game on there and you give it to everyone for "free" why wouldn't everyone wanna blast destiny first Friday they got it. They just hadnt catered for demand.
---
r/epstein for added balance, for there must be a neutral ground
---
Aaand the post was deleted wtf
---
Then u are definitely a new light player, havent had the d1 cayde, and year 1 cayde so didnt really care much to the character, if u are an old player tho, i would really like to ape u in the crucible and striker-titan 3 times in spawn, u wanna react? Uh oh looks like u are marked now
---
Thanks.  Luckily I'm still good but I instantly started getting error messages once I loaded into orbit but I'm clear now
---
Warlocks are definitely meta
---
Off here with braindeadlands 3.
---
One of the many reasons I went and purchased destiny was to help it overshadow Craplands 3's launch.
---
brah i was about to say that you you brain idea stealler
---
I think that they made this change so that people didn‚Äôt overly rely on heat rises to get energy back, and instead doubled down on the ankle breaking floaty stuff that they might have wanted skylock to be. So I think that that would be a fine change
---
Also regarding some of the presumed points, I can see the new melee being similar to knife trick than ball lightning, if one is going to have an aerial build it‚Äôs likely that you might want more than conventional range to your melee. And also I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre still able to aim in midair.
---
You won‚Äôt able to chain abilities anymore but with these changes there‚Äôs a chance that playmaking is much more viable and less reliant on other abilities. Although there probably wouldn‚Äôt be any sort of harm in letting the new heat rises regenerate grenade energy on aerial kill, akin to devour
---
I grabbed it for bright dust way back when TLW dropped and have never taken it off. I like the ADS reticle way better on it, too. Can't put my finger on why, though.
---
Yea i was playing at the time and was killed by it.
---
Unfortunately I never earned it till far after the nerf
---
This ain‚Äôt it cheif
---
10 hours and no fix, They busy here in forum downvoting every post that complain
---
This subreddit has STRONG memes
---
I got up to queue position 9000 and something like 20 min ago, feels bad man
---
Please use direct screenshots if you would like to post something from in-game, but also please do not spam the same screenshot as a ton of other people. You are one of  30-something people to make this same post. 
---
Highest was 12.7 K
---
The queue is real.
---
This is so true.
---
You clearly haven‚Äôt been shoulder charged 15 feet in the air. I have. On bannerfall plenty. I‚Äôm waaaaaay above said noskill, and Tim the Titan just shoves his massive shoulder pads down my throat from 15 feet away.
---
Is that an actual model of the gun or just a painting ( i really can‚Äôt tell)
---
I‚Äôm stuck between 3,000 and 5,000
---
22,146
---
Fair point. I haven't been to big into tv since they finished up Son's of Anarchy. Been trying to find a show like it.
---
I cant tell you how much my respect for bungie increased when they added the prismatic inferno emblem, only those who got it know the real pain and its not OEM or LoW
---
He was an idiot. Ironic.
---
Probably intentionally put it for a limited time and when the queues return to normal, gone.
---
Drink uninstall this fiasco shit, then you install warframe instead, servers up 24/7, no problems, and thats a free game lol
---
Your RNG must suck then because Contraverse Hold. If they don't have Peregrine Grieves and they shoulder charge you, YOU win because you live and get to 1-shot them
---
I was thinking of getting one for groceries too
---
Galajorn or however you spell it.
---
Rip d1
---
That guy looks like a penis
---
Rather just get unbroken next season
---
Penis
---
Did you not play warmind like at all?
---
Are we going to be able to progress further with the Vow catalyst quest after this season? I'm at 40% and don't know if I'll complete it in time.
---
And Ace
---
I would use those and just xena battlecry every time I dive down on some poor earthbound titan. I dig it!
---
Hive, bring a sword
---
I was about to be let in then it said the servers were down
---
Gravitation lance
---
Totally agree with everyone, go Wavesplitter for PvP and Coldheart for PvE.
---
I‚Äôm at 22040 and it just keeps getting higher. Been waiting some 45 minutes
---
Why cant real guns look this artistic?
---
Well then.
---
‚Ä¢already have warframe, about 400 hours logged
---
‚Ä¢I don‚Äôt care about cost, love the developers and company so as soon as they split from activision I didn‚Äôt mind a $45 price tag
---
‚Ä¢Warframe has its fair share of problems. dead pvp, huge power creep and have you seen the prices of some things on tradechat?
---
I love Wavesplitter for strikes. Fireteam members pop orbs everywhere with their masterworked weapons.
---
Wouldnt be hilarious if they gave us an emblem with what resembles a weasel, that would be cool and a reminder of this seasons most recurring theme
---
Well they better get their asses to the moon because we are busy ghost-busting.
---
3k lol I'm at 20k rn
---
I'll check back in like an hour
---
Come on! Come on! Come on! Let's go space truckin!
---
Yes. However, the catalyst progress booster from one of the season pass rank ups will (I am 99% sure) go away and you'll have to earn it anew from next season's rank ups.
---
I would give gold to this comment but I‚Äôm poor so here‚Äôs this: üèÖ
---
You can compete, just have to figure out what your playstyle is and what weapons
---
Here at Bungie we offer the GREATEST video game experience . How would you rate you experience from I‚Äôve been here for 9 hours to Meh
---
Yes at least to alleviate our pain for today cut out
---
Somehow never came into rotation haha strange since I‚Äôve been grinding bounties for weeks
---
Og Hung jury god rolled straight from the vendor reporting in
