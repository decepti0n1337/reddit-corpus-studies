Unbroken is harder. I have every other title. I am right you are wrong bud.

Why would you think they wouldn't? That's what a content creator does. Personally, I prefer it, I work on pc every day so it's good to have a few perspectives and a lot of breakdown. To each their own I guess.

Fuck please no,that name itself gives me terrible flashbacks... All the fucking purples

And yet I'd rather die 1000 times in PvP to it than that fugly Wardcliff Coil.

I dont think anyone is legitimately got hyped for pve truth tho I think we all knew truth was for pvp hype
---
[deleted]
---
I‚Äôve done the same. ‚ÄòDamn only glimmer. DAMNIT ONLY SHARDS‚Äô
---
As far as looks go, I absolutely agree that wardcliff looks like it was made about of garbage and duct tape.
---
Okay, so Season of the Forge has Black Armory gear (noted by the anchor looking symbol in the top left of the item). Season of the Drifter has Joker's Wild gear (circle with dots around it).  And I think the Season of Opulence might be Penumbra or something?
---
I might be way off, I just kind of assumed that's how it was.
---
Samest same I‚Äôve ever samed.
---
Though to be fair, all the Ikelos weapons are held together with zip ties.
---
Is it shotgun week?
---
Clint Barton
---
This was a week or so ago that I did this not sure. It took me 47 bosses to get that shotgun so good luck.
---
Yeassss..  I loved doing that in d1 especially on those maps where we can spawn sparrows. Aim, lock, quickly snap away and launch.
---
You‚Äôre speaking the Truth there.
---
I'm mildly impressed he got the revive up to ~96% before canceling.
---
Yeah seems most effective for while you have well-rested. Is it still more efficient then any other methods?
---
I like the Warmind look a lot better.  It looks kind of prototype-y.  Wardcliff just looks like it was pass out of a spaghetti strainer and parts of a bicycle that someone duct taped to a length of pipe.
---
I pressed on it, I‚Äôm on mobile, but it won‚Äôt let me do anything
---
My mind is bleeding
---
I tried this out for the first time earlier this week and I shit you not you can do this for hours. The rate of return along with the extra gear you get after the dismantles is insane. Bungie please dont nerf Vance.
---
Go through your vault and dismantle and cosmetics you don‚Äôt use, anything besides armor can be reacquired if you decide that you want to use it

I'm thinking it might be the raid smg. It looks like it's plated with Hive Chitin. The trailer did show the ascendant realm and Hive Chitin on the ground when it teased the raid afterall.

Posted an image of the map location you should fly into nessus via exodus black then head north to that waypoint. There is a marker there to start the quest. I just finished confirming that Kendrick's does spawn when you are in that mission.
---
What?

Didn‚Äôt know what you were talking about so I rewatched it then died laughing
---
Shooting someone with a shotgun?
---
*que evil laugh*
---
thats the Truth

I just hope they don't kill the Drifter anytime soon just because he became the new favourite character
---
I wish you luck, I need ten more headshots
---
It‚Äôs the one from the outbreak perfected mission puzzle. There is a puzzle in that mission and if you complete it each week for three weeks you get the ship. Also how you finish the outbreak catalyst in 3 weeks
---
A while back, machine gun boss damage was nerfed, so now machine guns are really only important for crowd clearing or pvp. In everyday pve activities, there's no reason to feel like you HAVE to use a machine gun, if you'd rather use a different gun.
---
This 100%. I feel like the death wouldnt have felt as...cheap i guess? If it hadnt been the first thing shown in the teaser trailer. Doing that kinda just made it seem like a 'people are losing interest, let's do something drastic!' Kind of move.
---
There isn't anything annual pass specific that is important to do now versus later. I'd recommend unlocking Service Revolver from Zavala or Last Perdition from Shaxx if either of those guns interest you.

it only worries me bc at least on console, the only way to seemingly counter a machine gun in crucible or gambit is either being literally across the map, or kill them with a machine gun first (cough invading with a hammerhead cough)
---
It‚Äôs in the Volunder forge in a cave under the collapsed bridge.
---
Yeah I mean imagine if in the 80's the trailer for empire strikes back had the vader-luke twist in it, very weird desicion on their part and it didn't help that the good story content ended just after cayde's death scene
---
‚ÄúFucking transvestite motherfucker‚Äù üòÇ
---
To be fair I‚Äôm pretty sure lore wise it pretty much was
---
it was a post made back on the bungie forums by a wise Titan, wiser than Saladin and Shaxx and Zavala. I brought his noble words with a few tweaks here because Peregrine greaves have been confirmed to return in the season of opulence
---
Maybe not 1st try .. but in 5 ,6 could be learned and take less time then 5 resets in crucible
---
Cayde was never supposed to be in Destiny and i think they found a legit way to make Uldren the new hunter vanguard, as absurd as it sounds. He was supposed to be the funny guy in early developement.
---
Cayde should stay dead. I remember how everyone thought he'd be back really soon, but nope. He ded. Maybe in the future we'll find some vex bs to pull him back.
---
They also killed the only guy with decent humor though.
---
As somebody who‚Äôs literally never taken Gjyallahorn off, how did the tracking of truth compare?
---
They also had vehicles :)
---
Year 1 gear are kinda useless but year 2 gear are useful across all seasons and year 1 weapons still kick ass like midnight coup and ep shotgun. 
---
And I say it's worth it.
---
4v4 primaries only was turned into 6v6 special weapon fiesta.
---
And we still got a couple of small maps after the change lol.
---
Thanks for the tip! Never knew these subs excisted. Will give it a try!!
---
Golden Gun when invading is just üëå. Especially if you couple it with Worldline and skate across half the map
---
Destiny is better, and I used to be a hardcore Warframe player. Welcome, Tenno!
---
One eyed mask doesn‚Äôt give Hp regeneration, I don‚Äôt know why everyone says this. It only gives a slow generating over shield that stops once shot once. the health regeneration is just regular recovery rate. It gives damage boost sure, but it‚Äôs not as unbeatable as it was when it first came out. When it was first came out and you asked me this I would agree with you but now I can‚Äôt.
---
Jeebus i didn't know it did that much damage with overcharge

Is this with or without the forsekan DLC?

I got the game when they gave it out for free, I'm yet to try it, what parts make you think destiny is better?
---
Not as cool but stood next to his spawn once and shot one shot him with GG and he called me a hacker without wanting to explain further.
---
ü§£ü§£
---
This is with the dlc. I feel the weapons are better. WF definitely has more weapons, but destinys weapons feel powerful, something a Warframe gun can‚Äôt achieve mods on weapons. And a huge factor, destiny has random rolls. You can always get good weapons with amazing perks.
---

/r/Fireteams is the place to post.
---
I'll say this right now as a Warlock main. If Mithras becomes the Hunter Vanguard, I will switch to a Hunter main. Just cause I want him to be my Vanguard
---
If you run the leviathan raid you will get better power gear up to 380.
---
I hope they bring back Truth's D1 ornaments as well. I need my prototype look back.
---
The loot I received isn't actually useless, you see. I got the glittering key to get the ship, I got age old bond (which was the last raid legendary that I needed) and I don't have to get 1k voices from my collections and use infusion resources to get it back to 700 power. Plus, now two of my characters can use it without me having to fumble with DIM or the companion app
---
When you talk to any of the main planet vendors they will each have 3 bounties. Shaxx will have 5 crucible bounties. Zavala has 5 strike/open world bounties. Also The nightfall which you are refering to can be beaten whilst below 270 (unless it doesnt let you in due to you being below 270 which it shouldnt)
---
go fuck yourself
---
Also hawthorn has bounties
---
If D2 gets the SRL then its probably going to get nerfed and fucked up to the point where it just turns into a foot race
---
Ah, the obligatory "go fuck yourself comment" I was waiting for it
---
I got a rampage and feeding frenzy with a range master works. I‚Äôm in love with this weapon.
---
The warlock icon from the loading screen has been my wallpaper forever. It‚Äôs awesome
---
28 runs to get mine the day after they buffed the drop rates I watched 3 in a raid I had to Sherpa all get one on the same clear... 3 in one raid.....
---
Nice! I have that same wallpaper without the raid flags and it felt like it lacked something, it definetly doesn't now:)
---
My boi where can I buy this
---
Jesus christ that must hurt. I was the only one on my team to get even one this run, and it was my second completion
---
That's awesome man!
---
Waka waka
---
it was fated to end this way
---
Ace of spades (exotic quest), outbreak prime (exotic quest), and Jotuun (exotic drop from beegusia forge when forging a golden frame) are the exotics id recommend. If you‚Äôre lucky 1000 voices (a random drop from the end of the last wish raid using an ethereal key you get from beating riven) that weapon is crazy. For legendaries, the forge weapons from Ada-1 and the gambit weapons are all pretty solid.

One time my friend had 20 motes from being a collector. We were killing Blockers so he could deposit and he got punched. This punch was no ordinary punch as it perfectly launched him into the invade portal stealing it from my Invader Friend. He then lost 20 motes on the other side. He still has flashbacks to this moment and I had the perfect view
---
Yes

Holy shit. That's hilarious =D

Game breaking, literally unplayable, bungo pls fix

There's no bungie here, just players like yourself. Cool idea though!
---
Yes indeed, just make sure it's shards for seeds, glimmer for seeds isn't worth
---
Oh Hedonism bot, always with the most delectable decadents.
---
Not a necessity but after the campaign you can return to each planet and you should get a bounty to start making a few exotics like Rat King and Sturm. I don't remember all the vanilla ones but even when I did it for the first time at 700 power it gave me a 280 level weapon so might as well unlock them early and see if you like them.
---
Also the weekly milestones don't have bounties you just get the reward when you complete such and such, ex 5 rounds of crucible for the weekly milestones or 3 strikes while using the same element subclass as a teammate
---
"bank those motes, summon that primevil". Blueberry proceeds to try to get 15 motes and gets killed by a red bar.
---
Would be cool. Like how ace combat did a mission.
---
Dont think it would be to hard for them to do
---
Ik right btw you @ the wrong person
---
Is impossible to stop that when you through the granade, so you can stay on the middle and, maybe, something hidden happen xD
---
It gets you an emblem? Damn it. I thought it was just for the dlc.
---
No it wouldn‚Äôt work. You would have to buy it on your brothers account. Me and my bro had the same problem.

Tyou need to buy it on the acc w the dlcs, idek if itll even let you download it w/o the dlcs

Lol I dont even know what to say to that
---
Definitely don't be dumb and buy it from a third party source either
---
You‚Äôre probably just bad
---
So Uldren was always a prick. He would have done literally anything for Mara, who also detests guardians. But Mara has a way of only caring about herself so I doubt she'd want to bring Uldren with her anyways. Thats as much as I remember, if I'm being honest

r/fireteams, for advice, r/crucibleplaybook

please tell me you're joking buddy.

Pretty sure they explained this last year
---
This here is the quality content I come to Reddit for. Cheers Guardian.
---
Okay. Was just letting you know...
---
What about the exotic hunter legs?
---
I understand why you did this, but gd do I hate hate invaders who do this. Now I'm in a sweaty panic of wanting to continue doing what I was doing and looking over my shoulder the whole time waiting for the invader to kill me out of nowhere all the sudden.
---
nezerac‚Äôs sin is a good exotic to farm void ability kills with, since it also gives you charge for void weapon kills not just ability kills
---
Is the ship in the bottom pic an exotic?  Is that the Crucible Metallic or the Suros Modular Shine shader?  Either way, I would use it.
---
Also if you are getting rid of shaders master rahoul can recycle your duplicates. He gets rid of 5 shaders at once so it is a bit more bareable than dismantling 1 at a time.
---
I recently cleared all of my shaders and got over 10k bright dust lol.
---
Not just good advice. Super Good Advice to be exact.
---
They honestly just say a lot of vague things in the response. I‚Äôm asking for a real answer. One of the responses given was, ‚ÄúDestiny has changed since 2015‚Äù. Well I‚Äôm asking why? Why would it change for the worse, IMO? It also says they weren‚Äôt ‚Äúhappy with its role in the ecosystem‚Äù. What the fuck does that even mean? I just wanted a real answer that actually makes sense. Not some pre written public statement that‚Äôs meaningless.
---
Did you play trials in d2? It was fucking awful and no fun to play
---
‚ÄúYOU HAD ONE JOB!!‚Äù
---
The Orpheus rigs yea
---
I missed my chance:( I didn‚Äôt get the game and another Xbox until it was gone. I have several friends who played and they essentially said the same thing as you. What made it so bad? How could it possibly be so difficult to re create 3v3, win 9 in a row? It was such a simple formula that I struggle to understand how it doesn‚Äôt translate. Can you explain why it wasn‚Äôt any fun, but D1 was amazing? Honestly, if they added trials back rn, I‚Äôd go home and re install today.
---
People assume he‚Äôs probably a hunter now that he‚Äôs risen, because he seems... Hunterey, I guess?
---
Ok, now do the Patient Zero ornament. ;)
---
Thanks for this awesome new wallpaper!
---
I think it would be Opulent of Bungo if we finally got the exptic Edge Transit that fires exploding Edge Transits
---
I get that he's hunter like. But if one hunter makes a bet with another does that extend to every single hunter?
---
Thanks man lol
---
Nope. Im right.
---
If the step is a triumph it will persist, like 5 resets for Redrix. If the step is just a quest step, then it must be in the same season.
---
Still think it's probably a raid weapon, looks similar to the rocket launcher you see. But who knows!
---
I need one of these in my life!
---
Over on the sidebar on the righthand side of this sub is [this pic](https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2we4j/styles/image_widget_pun3vjbfh1131.jpg?format=pjpg&amp;s=a71c1fec3e2b13cddbcba86f6ce814e891a1b0b1), the bottom stuff is exclusive to the Annual Pass.
---
looks like the breakneck sights without a rim
---
You‚Äôre missing Gambit Prime, Black Armory, Reckoning, Penumbra, and power surge bounties are the highlights. I might be missing some though. You can achieve the same level as everyone else, except it‚Äôs easier with AP.
---
The flag on the right side is for the new raid dude
---
I agree, something neat if you're taking another character through the story though. I wish we could revist these, I'd love to get one for Arcstrider.
---
Reckoning? Zero hour?
---
I'm a very story driven man, I don't have the drive to do everything again, because I already know the entire story, and like with dark souls, I know most of it and I just can't find anymore interest in it

Can yo I do a top tree nova bomb warlock
---
(On PS4) i just hold square before heavy spawns and I get it

Lucky for you i already had one ready

I tried but the lag just infuriates me on pc.

I also forgot to factor in Triple Infamy. Is it essentially the regular Infamy gain with all factors multiplied by 3?
---
My first full completion of LW with my clan (as I only finished the first two encounters my previous attempts with them around the launch of the raid.) I got the curated pulse, sparrow, and 1k voices. They were a bit salty.
---
Yeah, D1 exotics we're really mild by comparison to the kind we have now- which make it really fun for pve but a problem in pvp. And pinnacle weps ugh
---
I think part of the reason pvp was 'good' in d1 was because they were jumping off Halo, and lots of halo people were playing destiny which gave it a deeper player pool. There was also more choice in playlists which also helped. 
---
There's also this nostalgic tinge you know? It was the first of its kind. You could forgive the fuckups and things. But I think if that same pvp environment was still around today people would be bitching all the time just like they do now.
---
I hope that, for the benefit of people like you, that they do have more structured pvp in D3 and learn from these mistakes. I just don't foresee it changing in this game now. I can't imagine how hard it was for them to change it as much as they have already. Keep hoping for the best, dude üëç I wish you well
