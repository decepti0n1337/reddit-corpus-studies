Enough with the damn hand cannons Bungie. Wouldn‚Äôt care as much if they fired worth a damn on console. Fix the recoil or focus on other guns! Preferably both!

Last wish, scourge and crown will award powerful stuff. Leviathan is year 1 capped including eater and spire
---
I pooched up on my positioning, but yes HARD F
---
I never said it would be convenient, but I agree that it is not. I just pointed out that being abke to sit on a couch while gaming is not exclusive to any platform.
---
Once carried a 515 friend through last wish like this, the fucker didn‚Äôt have a single kill but got 1k voices
---
I tried so hard to make my guardian look like me because Bungie said we would be playing as our guardian from day 1 to the end. So I was so upset that I had to be eyebrowless in D2 lol
---
Just my opinion but I thought it would look 10x more professional with neater speech bubbles n textüëå
---
I mean I see where you're coming from, but to me that's kinda a waste of money. Ofcourse coming from a broke guy I'll try to save as much money as I can.
---
By the looks of it... Defo an exotic
---
"don't worry guys were safe now" -some guardian 30 seconds after dodging nova bomb
---
Oh I see what you meant?
---
Try it with:
---
2 orpheus rig hunters going invisible and throwing balls
---
1 titan bannershield blocking incoming damage during dps
---
3 warlocks with well and one was using phoenix, the others luna. 
---

---
Chain wells in the back left/right corner behind the pillar, all six stack there. During dps we went all the way up near chest and used bannershield + well, sometimes empowered. We couldn‚Äôt get the 2 phase tho, used solar spike GLs from collection and jot√ºnn
---
They need to drop a special ammo one!
---
What horrible atrocities. You're fired from Titan'ing.
---
*hears nova bomb*

Enemy: ‚Äúfuck fuck fuck fuck FUCK FU-‚Äú *boom*
---
beautiful.

#MOONS HAUNTED
---
Tripmine doesn‚Äôt one shot... tell me what grenade in D2 does(without the support of an exotic)? 
---
Also let‚Äôs not forget that Hunters can deflect Nova Bombs, Hammers and Blade Barrage with the middle Arc Staff tree. 
---
I‚Äôm also pretty sure Tether isn‚Äôt supposed to one shot guardians. It‚Äôs a supportive super that can expose the enemy‚Äôs location, disorient, suppress and weaken them.
---
And Stormcaller Warlocks have an insane grenade ability. Arc Web can easily kill a group of guardians standing together. You don‚Äôt even have to stand close to each other. I just died to one even though I ran away and was about a mile away but the shit hits you like 3 times until you die no matter the distance once you are hit. Yeah Nova Warp melee sucks but they do have Handheld Supernova which is also a pain in the ass. And I don‚Äôt know what melee it is but sometimes I get pushed out of the solar system by a Warlock‚Äôs melee, falling of a cliff or dying as I break my back against a wall.
---
Try not getting close
---
That ain‚Äôt armpit chief
---
Get up on outta here with my eyeholes!!
---
Love the R&amp;M reference btw.
---
for every one dank novabomb like that I probably have 1000 that just hit a wall
---
Are you on PC? If so I'll add you and Sherpa any raid you want. Also, why don't you make the lfg and group and bring people in instead of going into groups that way you have control and no one can kick you, then the assholes can just leave if they want
---
I learned from this vid and popped Arcstrider and Raiden Flux. Won 3, until we had 2 other hunters jump in with shadowshot and orpheus rigs. We didnt even make the bridge
---
you aren't showing your deaths
---
Honestly this one was pretty bad, just the tracking saved it, it should have crashed into like five different things
---
If you get the right artist and have a good enough reference picture it‚Äôs pretty easy, I highly recommend it man :)
---
No I‚Äôm on console but thanks for offering
---
Plus there are some cool Hunter things you could draw from lore wise, like the six coyotes for example!
---
nice tat but hunter master race
---
Thanks lol

Nah, it‚Äôs the Fire Victorious from the Firebreak order of Titans

Ps4 at least uses sata2 connection so even if you stick a juicy ssd in there it won't do much since the read speeds are limited by the interface anyway. It might improve the load times a little because of faster response time from the ssd but the effects are minimal.

For something that's accessed fairly often you'd think it would be smarter to store at least the loadout in ram then it'll be pretty much instant regardless of platform.

Sucks you can‚Äôt see the bug outside of reload I guess

as a novalock I can say the greatest feeling to be had is launching off a nova at the exact same time as an enemy and blasting them into dust while juking theirs so it just floats off into the nothingness.

Go to ada1 and get her weekly bounties.

Haha thanks! I loved blink before this season, but now with Astrocyte Verse.... I can be *everywhere*

you‚Äôre approaching me?

Titans:imma punch this dude

Ok, i will. Thank you.

Blade dance is a impact focused move while storm trance has a more continuous damage rate. If your talking about chaos reach it still applies
---
Completing one of the weekly bounties from Ada 1 will give you a ballistics log. She has 2 weekly bounties at a time

As I titan, I HATE you!!

On top of the Y1 DLCs, you can explore all current and future patrols zones for free. You even get access to the PvPvE gamemode Gambit, which requires Forsaken at this moment to play.

Lol got em

I tried hugging him... Got madly rejected :'(

Wonder why they went to FTP. Is the player base dwindling down a bit? I heard the last expansion (forsaken?) was pretty good.

You have to complete all the adventure missions on mercury.

Yes. Don‚Äôt start another character until you‚Äôre comfortably 750.

Maybe Crimson is the problem.

I mean. Oh well. You can't act rude towards them then try and play the high and mighty game with your money bud.

Learn a lesson from this on how to talk to others. If they were openly hostile first then sure, but if you go around acting like that you will find it'll cause you problems. Just something for you to think about.
---
I don't think they need to put one Type of weapon in another to make it look good. Whisper, Lumina, Anarchy, 1KV and so many other exotics look fantastic, without that
---
It continues to happen, even while I do the story missions... All gear from my collections is also level 20 locked, 266 power.

Yeah, all we can do is just teoryze and both options could be true but i think that Quria with its bit of freewill left would do something against savath√ªn

At least I learned I could summon my ship at the hangar.

Lol man you need to grow up. Blocked and ... I don't care?  Bye bye.
---
They reset weekly on Tuesday.
---
Don't get me wrong, the possibility is there, although knowing Savath√ªn, things like Truth to Power may just be a facade when it comes to Quria's motivations. Besides, we have 2 and 1/2 months ahead of us, so we can't say much as of now.
---
Thanks man
---
Yes, they've been resetting on Sunday, but it's supposed to be Tuesday. This is a relatively low priority bug fix, so that is why it's Sunday still.

I just recently reinstalled and picked up forsaken. I‚Äôm currently (when I have free time) building my light level to the mission but I really don‚Äôt want to watch cayde die.

Promises are feeble coming from corporate "powers" so to speak. 
---
"We feel like everyone will love Destiny 2, newcomers and veterans alike."
---
"The game will be in a great state when it launches"
---
Remember how those promises came to fruition? 
---
The game had an awful launch, was clunky and boring and was in an awful state.
---
Damn! I‚Äôll Notify the burn ward
---
Thanks man :D
---
Reminds me of a similar ability in Halo reach. I think it would be a lot of fun.
---
No. Both of those players are at fault for getting themselves shotgunned. First guy couldn‚Äôt aim or was distracted - and he had a shotgun too but his shot failed. He messed up. Second guy wasn‚Äôt paying attention - he should have known someone was close but he was running blindly around corners. 
---
Clips like this actually help players get better because it teaches them how to be more aware - emoting around corners is smart. Knowing that can be a trick up your enemy‚Äôs sleeve also helps you get better, because then you can be thinking about the fact that others may be able to see you before you see them.
---
There can only be one!
---
Yo, as soon as I saw that giant ass nova bomb casually cruzin between the platforms I laughed so hard, woke up some family members (sharing a cabin, also it‚Äôs 12a)
---
Wow...I don‚Äôt know why that got me but I haven‚Äôt laughed that hard in a while.
---
I ENVY YOUR STRENGTH GUARDIAN.
---
If you die to that you have nobody but yourself to blame. Yes he's able to see more than you, but you should be paying attention to your radar when going around corners. It puts a big red mark indicating where he is, and he's obviously waiting on you. Make smart plays and win games.
---
I‚Äôve never had a Nova track that well. Sometimes, I‚Äôve even had Novas aimed directly at guardians just hit walls instead of tracking.
---
And so that means you want that to happen again! You say what they say means jack shit and cant be trusted but want a whole new game and a retread of little to no content again? Fuck out of here honestly you cant stand them or the fact they dont want to go back to the drawing board then leave. Quit the game and quit whining on reddit
---
Finger me
---
I ADMIRE YOUR WORK GUARDIAN! LET'S TALK AGAIN!
---
This sounds bloody amazing.
---
Too similar. But you got any other ideas?? (also wouldn't the new super be like black hence "shadow") doesn't make much sense to have another solar ability.
---
I keep putting it down after caydes dead. Healing rift doesnt heal my broken heart.

Didn't realize those were even part of the triumphs needed. Damn. I probably will never even earn a title üòì. Good on ya though.
---
"My will made real!"
---
That sounds like a bitrate too high, I‚Äôll check what mine is at when I get the chance
---
Oh yeah Wayfarer is probably one of the hardest ones to get IMO but if you want to invest time (or you just hate yourself like me LOL) it feels good when you finally earn it üòä
---
I‚Äôm glad you found some Guardians to play with. Since D1 Beta this game has been a pretty big source of escapism and fun for me. It‚Äôs great to hear others are getting good times out of it too.
---
Lv30 380(?) light because CoO and Warmind are now free.

It makes me real happy that when New Light launches, people can play the first mission of waking up in The Cosmodrome like we did years ago.
---
Play rumble and disable DM's
---
Izanagi's Burden

The trick for the EP weapons is keeping an eye on the final bosses which rotate because they will drop specific weapons each week. Osprey was the  last thing I needed and I had to run the Strange Terrain NF ~50 times for it to drop üòÖ
---
What about spells?! I have no Forsaken. So after transfer i have no new abilities. Buy i want to buy shadowkeep. What with this point?
---
Leviathan, Last Wish, Scourge of the Past, and Crown of Sorrow
---
Eh...
---
A couple hundred of live rounds into the Rifleman is enough for me.
---
And I get to snipe that PoS 3 times on 3 different characters in 3 different ways.
---
Why's LoW so highly praised? I don't play PvP, maybe it's one of those must have weapons.... If you play PvP. Can't find much use for it pve
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter if you ain‚Äôt hitting your shots, there‚Äôs a reason why the Ace are popular on PC but not on console.

I feel attacked, I don‚Äôt run triple nade but I get messages saying I‚Äôm reported for aim bot with mountaintop. I don‚Äôt even predict I just yeet.

What kind of cheats are you using for it not to slightly clip a corner and explode?

It's origin story

DUDE I REMEMBER RUNNING FROM FUCKING TRACKING NOVA'S IT'S TERRIFYING

Honestly same! Favourite part of D1 was sitting down on a Friday night with my fireteam and grinding out trials! (Plus the Blind Jackel armour for the Warlock was awesome)

21 and that was really pushing it.

Why don't you play with lfg people? I met some great folks and did my last reset for dredgen in 3 days, just with lfg people :)

I mean theres a ton of people dead set on hating destiny, you're no different from them.
---
This isn‚Äôt as bad but it‚Äôs annoying when people invade as soon as the portal is up and the enemy team doesn‚Äôt have many motes to lose then later in the round when you have no invasions left the enemy team has lots of unbanked motes.
---
It also had some hair physics and actually moves, it also didnt look terribly scruffy with those weird edges
---
I think that's a you problem, it got the same ttk as a 150 now while having limited range
---
The logic behind it makes no sense either. If your willing to pay this much for the gun the it must mean you‚Äôre a dog shit PvP player who‚Äôs got no thumbs. So why would they want a gun DESIGNED for PvP if they can‚Äôt play PvP.
---
[deleted]
---
It just has a fast as hell ttk its recoil pattern is very manageable and the sound it makes when shooting is the sex.

If they(other players) aren‚Äôt playing how they(OP) play then they‚Äôre playing wrong.

Don‚Äôt you know?

How good is the Huckleberry?

Just came back, grinded 20-50 last 2 days.

Why post this? You called a guy out for having a different playstyle than you, he beats you in a 1v1 and then you beat him? No one seemingly were rude at all surprisingly. Drama queen
---
Play style? Lol what
---
These look great but are they the right scale they just seem off in some way?
---
Eh maybe, but still it's one of my least favourite hand cannons.

Interesting tid bit... Anthony Joshua is/was a huge fan.

A high skill super for sure
---
Grenade launchers
---
15-20 is usually my average but just went a bit crazy today haha
---
THIS IS AMAZING
---
 Kackis is a nob
---
As a D2 only player, I'm honestly kinda shocked. Character creation wasn't improved and if anything gotten worse.
---
It's the same as any weapon that comes with a masterwork. The only difference here is you get to pick what it is instead of it being random. When you upgrade it to level ten you get orbs.
---
20 it was a rumble match
---
# GUARDIAN DOWN
---
I appreciate the research on your part, but yeah most D1 players will know from experience sadly that their guardians got hit with an ugly stick lol. Like try and make the guardian in my meme on the left in D2, its a big ooof.

Honestly hate kickhakus or whatever his name is. His vids are bullshit and clickbait like DPJ.

I usually will stick with the team.  It's hard speaking to people when they don't have mics plugged in themselves, so I usually just wing it.  I'm surprised I even reached 1000 Glory just sniping.

Haha OMG no but now I can't unsee... I have had my character look this way since the beginning of D1.

I have never felt a video so hard

This is exactly what I was looking for! Too bad it‚Äôs not an app but a website isn‚Äôt the worst thing either.
---
Still not worth it compared to any other weapon with dragonfly. I wouldn't bother grinding for it unless scouts get a buff.
---
Actually, I didn‚Äôt get health recovery off the kills. My recovery is just really bad and I was lucky i didn‚Äôt get shot again. The super only gives me a little longer duration if I get a kill.
---
Fair

Arin Hanson is that you?

Have my upvote.  Agree 100%

hmm hmm interestiiiing √≤√µ very helpful info thank you very much man!

You might need to look at other messages where you cursed at someone,  easy comm ban etc. But if you get banned for exchange of goods it's permanent usually so that's probably not why you got banned.

I still like the taken king better, but Forsaken was amazing too. Cayde üò≠üò≠
---
That light is just the buffed animation of Ace. If it doesn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúMomento Mori‚Äù on the left side then that‚Äôs not it. It does that for every gun.
---
its supers in general. 3 shot golden gun can kill in super if the resistance isn't too high as well. fun fact, titan slam used to be a shut down super too, they just added the roaming part. also I named 4 supers not 2.

They just need a 4v4 casual mode cause the 6v6 is literally a super war
---
‚ÄúWhoa, hey...how did that get there?‚Äù
---
Do you equip the better powerful gear?
---
I use Hive Barrier, Hive Armaments, Hive repurposing, and that mod that gives a 25% damage bonus to your subclass element.
---
Once I‚Äôve finished everything this season I‚Äôm replacing the 25% one with Hive Invigoration
---
Do you use the text chat? Or do you have a mic?
---
Well depends not on what people say or you think is op, but what you are most comfortable with. Try all of them and then decide.
---
I-It‚Äôs not like I missed on purpose or anything
---
This is definitely my favorite, love it
---
It shouldint matter the game knows what's your max anyways right?
---
ah yes in two months ive only messaged my friend group and told somebody who wanted my clan to go away
---
I play pc and I gotta say Hammerhead kills me more times than low does
---
Hunters are fine, they're already at the top of the food chain in pvp.
---
Well if you have unlocked all the forges, you can speak to the black robot lady in the tower who gives bounties for specific weapons. The pulse rifle is blast furnace and once you complete it once you can keep getting it skipping much of the quest steps. Rinse and repeat until you get a roll you like :) one i have has drop mag, rampage, zen moment and i think stability as a masterwork and it's pretty legit!
---
Got it, thanks again kind guardian!
---
I don't think Hawkmoon will return and if in its old fashion. In Destiny 2 we don't have 3rd lucky in the chamber perk, so they need a new concept for hawkmoon then.
---
Your assumption about just "knowing" that someone paid is a bit specious but in either case destiny tracker doesn't lie.
---
Also your logic in the quantity that have NF is correlated with its nerf is also a poor argument. Bungie was clear and said what their expectation for how many people in the community would get NF was wayy of. 
---
Not only do wayy less people have NF than they originally expected,  it's large in part because the entire community is not dedicated enough to the grind it truly takes. It can't really be solo qued and with a good group its long and arduous.  
---
The nerf is because it was a ttk breaking weapon in the game.  It circumvented all other time to kill values in the game making most any other weapon but long range pulse that only wins outside 55 or 60 meters assuming both players hit perfect shots,  or scouts at that range or longer. It killed faster than any primary and made illegitimate all other guns.
---
 Now its in line with the ttk values in thr game and is still one of the best hc in the game by far.
---
Buy it 2 Raid and plus everything else 100% worth
---
Bakengangstet
---
They would be a disaster in this game. It would exacerbate the complaining about the lack of dedicated servers.
---
Yes. If your light level itself doesn't change it is because of that. Your normal drops are always below your light. However powerful drops like nightfall or raid items should drop at a higher light level than your current gear, so keep and eye out for that.
---
Litterally dude you won't knwo until you try. For instance I was a hunter main since D1 never wanted anything to do with the other classes until the reckoning and I grinded my warlock for that sweet gear and Im surprised that I love warlock more then my hunter, new main. So just try them all out and see how they all feel :)
---
i tried Arc Slam CPR, but it didnt help
---
You only get higher power level gear from doing activities that list "powerful gear" as the reward. 
---
You are correct, you don't have to have your highest gear equipped for it to influence the level loot drops at. You just have to have it in your inventory or vault. Do not dismantle it!
---
I would be upset that whisper isn‚Äôt on there, but that gun is dead
---
Hey does anyone know what auto rifle that is?
---
Thanks in advance
---
I had smthn happen in a gambit match once where I literally chain supered the primeval to death. I had shards, but they can‚Äôt do that.
---
Why would you want bath water from someone born 1 minute ago?
---
You can find where to get items from using the database website light.gg, going to an item's page, and scrolling to the bottom.
---
Wait i‚Äôm confused
---
I covered this in another response but,  peoplr just flat stop playing comp except a few hundred of the best that just enjoy the competition. They are pretty much the vast majority of teams that exist above 4500 to 5.5k 
---
Low comp is very well populated and balanced, I just did a double carry with a 0.6 and like 0.5 ish overall pvp kd. We won two 3v4's bc some trashbag left when we went down by 1 point early on. And we lost like a total of 4 game 0 to 2100.
---
There is no Match making, you have to go to LFG and make a team
---
There is no matchmaking. Notice when you hover over raids, they do not list "matchmaking" under the features.

[A guide for getting in to raiding that I recently made.](https://old.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/c95ojp/a_guide_to_raiding_in_season_7_for_new_players/)
---
Oh okay, thanks a lot!
---
That's cool cause I'm seeing this thing called Refer-A-Friend? What is that?
---
Okay, thanks! I didn't do raids until recently, so i didn't know.
---
Hmm maybe it's just the ridiculously large and strong AoE explosions that happen every 2 seconds lol my bad. I think the blink jump mixed with sith hands and Nova warp make them a lot harder to shoot plus the range on both of them is a bit much.
---
I don't really know what that is either but it said something about start over a character from what I understood so I never touched it
---
Thanks! I'll Read this.
---
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the cabal on Mars.
---
DLC purchases are platform-specific. On PC, the game itself is moving from battle net to steam, so anyone on PC will be playing through steam instead of battle net. You would have to buy DLC separately for PC to be able to play DLC activities on PC.
---
Precision knives should 1 shot, but only one specific subclass on warlocks have the 1 shot nade, and it's terribly inconsistent. Warlocks should get that physics push bug back.
---
They should make that one chalice upgrade always give you a second reward.
---
i need that. playing crucible a think. wining a think which is really hard. and al so i hate pvp in this game so everyoner carriying me :'(. ireally dont want to poaly crucible but what can you do sometiesm. \~ft.

It's for when you have a friend that hasn't bought forsaken yet. You get a power boost when you're friend buys or a gift or something
---
i forgot about coldheart lol
---
It‚Äôs decent in gambit
---
are you living in season 4?
---
the range on them has dropoff one max charge explosion point blank can't oneshot a super and if you spam them they do even less
---
gonna assume you mean the super blink and not the jump on stormcaller its slower and takes a fairly large amount of energy and on novawarp it can be spammed but that doesn't matter because xcept for goldie and BB you'll still hit them
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
seriously the charge isnt that strong anymore
---
What is the discord?
---
What does the "Invitation of the nine" do?
---
Who else read this in aztecross‚Äô voice?
---
it's fanfiction written by the psions and if they were prophecies they won't come true because they were written down osiris got past that by hiding them in poems
---
I'll let you know if I sprout a Vex arm or something üòâ
---
except osiris because he hid them in poetry
---
Ye
---
Best compliment on any meme you can get is someone saying that‚Äôs it‚Äôs a cool meme
---
Thank you
---
It might hop up, the update night not have registered that you have the game installed already. Seen it happen to someone in my clan.
---
it just feels wrong to ADS when enemies are close, but you have to unless you want to waste a noble round.
---
Love that they refused to mention destiny all throughout development
---
What up guys.... Rick Jack*** here
---
Looking at you, tether
---
Nty I really don‚Äôt want to look that up, that‚Äôs seriously disgusting. Thanks for the context but I don‚Äôt think I wanted to know it now lol
---
Rip teather
---
As someone who was slap-killed into a wall just last week, I can confirm it still happens once in a while
---
Did Cayde have more to do in D1? As someone who played only D2, It was a shame to see him go but it wasnt particularly hard hitting
---
It‚Äôs 10 for each season, and there are 4 seasons a year.
---
I remember this too well
---
Are trace rifles even a thing?
---
You are not the only one. I wish we still had the no land beyond meta.
---
It isn't our falt that bungo keep nerfing us
---
u/uwutranslator
---
Yup gambit and gambit prime(weirdly enough) will be free also along with all strikes iirc
---
Forsaken+annual pass still needs to be bought as a bundle, though they'll be 40 dollars total permanently so not a bad offer
---
Only things like menagerie/forges/reckoning, raids, exotics, story, endgame content will be premium basically
---
If you have Anarchy just make sure you are one of the people with the buff, stand well back and fire a couple of nades every so often to proc the melee. You'll keep the buff the whole time so it won't matter if your team all lose theirs.
---
I'm getting up there as well. I completed 20 times got frustrated and stopped. Probably gonna try again when I get home. 
---
They should of made it so that your very first clear gave you the sword then you could grind rng fir different rolls.
---
Honestly man you really dontit just sounds like you find no meaning in progressing which is undoubtedly true imo
---
Try to say that again while u are in a Peach to kill riven
---
d1 tether was actually good tho it just became garbage in d2
---
Is that‚Äôs merciless I see? ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a man of culture!!
---
Shadowkeep, no. Other seasonal content like anual pass stuff might be.
---
All the reapers and collectors complaining. I can do that in my sleep.
---
Think khostov will come with it?
---
I appreciate the help!
---
I think the art style is the same in D2, just everything is a lot shinier. The colors in D1 were a bit more matte, at least in my memory. 
---
Good times.
---
In my random running around trying to get the wayfarer title I‚Äôve seen a fair amount of people using them
---
Sylok wants to defile your light if you know what i meanüòâ
---
My favorite memory was when skolas was added and our team didn‚Äôt understand mechanics so we spent 8 hours playing one round of Poe. 128 tries later we succeeded.
---
It's always been a marketing scheme why don't they do the rainbow stuff after a big push or during a big rally? Cause they just want the money
---
Yeah your right it is terribleness D2 but is d1 it‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt any better. I just want a faster reaction after the tether lands. It shouldn‚Äôt take that long to take effect.
---
That is very disrespectful to giant man
---
but big show is a Hunter
---
Ist glaub f√ºr die Tributhalle
---
I just Lmao
---
ah yes rule 7
---
You have no idea how much I love to see this post.
---
ah yes the defeat glitch is stil in game
---
No one was hospitalized. Don't spread misinformation. The article was photoshopped using this article as a template from the same author: https://www.newscentermaine.com/article/news/local/3-people-sent-to-hospital-after-small-plane-crash-in-montville/97-620fa105-0c70-4c5a-b9e6-fbb116fbcc56

shadow gilt
---
Und was bringt die oder was macht die ? XD
---
No it was just a visual glitch, you can see when it shows the scoreboard that we won
---
I have it and didn‚Äôt get my coin
---
As I understand it, it means you can play on multiple platforms using the same character/account. There will not be account merging, and DLC purchases are platform specific. It's different from crossplay because people are still only able to play with others on the same platform as them. 
---
So for example, let's say you have all DLC on PS4. You can play with that same character on PC, but you would have to buy DLC for PC separately. While you are playing on PS4, you can't play with people on PC, and while you are playing on PC, you can't play with people on PS4.
---
I miss you Bad Juju, I hope you're doing well.
---
You have to reach fabled in competitive crucible valor is quick play glory is competitive
---

---
Yeah fuck Rick kekis
---
Vesper of Radius. Explain please
---
You have to get a "Not On My Watch" medal.
---
Well i got mine finally at the 43st run and to celebrate i did another run and got my second -. - i would also prefer a guaranteed sword for flawless
---
Du kriegst irgendwie mit dennen Rabatte auf bestimmte Sachen oder so(bei einem neuen Vendor). Genaueres wei√ü (ich zummindest) nicht .
---
thats a yikes from me
---
they had them?
---
Fashion is the real endgame, which leads you to doing hard activities to get the cool armor and so on. idk if you care about fashion though
---
I thought it was gonna explode when u walked by
---
Guess I should farm the menagerie then before it's gets patched on Tuesday
---
no why do you hold the button to slide
---
could just heal when it hits an ally
---
We had something called Ursa Furiosa. It was god tier in Forsaken but the super energy you got back was massively nerfed.
---
yup, thats what i am doing, I want to be prepared for shadowkeep
---
Prodigal gauntlets?
---
Pair it with a breackneck for addclear and gl with spike grenade for bosses and I think trace rifles have their place.
---
750
---
Final round Efrideets lolololololololol i miss it üòû
---
I can still hear the players emptying their mags in crucible
---
That isn't the best price though. You can get Forsaken and everything before it on disc for $20, and the annual pass for $15. I just think it's a little silly that they still haven't made it any easier for the people buying their game. Give us the option to purchase every piece of content in one bundle, 3 transactions is unnecessary.
---
Psst ..... take me with you
---
1 i was gonna say about last word
---
26v6 was a mistake
---
3 midtown
---
4 spawns work on a concept as to where is the enemy if most of the enemy team is at one spawn but one is at the other you will spawn at the other
---
5 be happy you don't have gamblers ruin its 10 times worse
---
The quest appears as a purple flag with a white crown icon in the EDZ near where Devrim is. Do you have that?
---
See the FAQ pinned to this subreddit.
---
honestly I would‚Äôve followed
---
Yup
---
Twas broken though
---
Just run Whisper heroic and go to the pit of thralls with a masterworked weapon, bonus orbs with top tree nightstalker hunter
---
I would say the same thing but he's only owned the game for 4 hours
---
Looks awesome! I love pixel art, and these are dope. I‚Äôve been using Huckleberry a ton lately for Menagerie, so I‚Äôm partial to it... love how you got the curl of the hand guard in just a few pixels. Will you be adding Thunderlord? üôè
---
lord of wolves reminds of the d1 ornament, crispy
---
True, but it was actually useful in PvE. The nerf killed it
---
Oh my remember the thorn glitch with a final round first bullet üò≠
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be making the post if it wasn‚Äôt the case. I make sure to run EP at least three rounds a day since last November, and the only thing I ever get is shaders.
---
Whooosh
---
They've been pandering the exact same way to veterans for decades. Same game, different demographic.
---
I've never got a drop from the boss except for dyes.  I thought you have to open the locked chest to get the ikelos.
---
I can understand how the grind can get boring. Once you get all the rolls you want, why return to the activity?
---
Or maybe the content just isn't appealing. Happened to me with Season of the Drifter. Played a single game of GP, got Thorn, and only played Reckoning for the rest of the season. Gambit just isn't my thing.
---
September will be a great time to get back into the game if you're really sick of the grind. Shadowkeep looks like nothing but fun.
---
D2 is getting less and less grindy. This new combination of player choice and RNG started in Black Armory and has lived on in the Menagerie, and I'm loving it.
---
The grind does get a bit boring at times, but the game is built around it. But the game is only getting better with each season.
---
There really isn't anything else I can say except try and find something you enjoy.
---
Good luck finding that thing, if it's out there.
---
But it doesn't matter where people cast their supers, they'll just keep killing themselves while any enemy super is active even if its half way across the map
---
I got the shotty on my 7th or 8th completion of EP, must of been luck.
---
Both, actually
---
25 man.
---
Crossplay would be crossing between different consoles. Not console-pc right? Consoles would get recked in crucible. I honestly would probably stop playing.
---
It‚Äôs returned to being a random drop.
---
No, that just grants the armor, the weapons will just drop from the boss.
---
I‚Äôm jealous. It‚Äôs one of the only special weapons I need to collect all of them, and it evades me.
---
Good thing I'm pretty decent at pvp
---
Don't get me wrong I've been enjoying the game and I don't regret spending money on Forsaken, but the content is also fairly old and no full game/expansions should be $80. The main campaign and the first two DLCs are about to be free to play (which is great) but I don't believe the two expansions will be worth $80 together. I think $55-$60 would be a much more fair price all things considered, and that's including the new annual pass for Shadowkeep.
---
My point isn't what you value the game at, it's that Destiny 2 and the original have been monetized so heavily and that turns off a lot of potential players. They have gotten much better, but I still think Bungie could take it further and continue to grow the playerbase and gain some much needed good will. $80 for the newest content isn't the best way to do that in my opinion.
---
"Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the cabal"
---
Dang really I‚Äôm kicking myself in the ass now for not getting on this game again I already bought my exotic engram for this week so that‚Äôs great üôÉ
---
General opinion on classes?
---
Titans: Shit in PvE
---
Warlocks: Master race
---
Hunter: Sweaty in Crucible
---
(that's from my collection of opinions, anyways)
---
Popular by default would most probably be Hunter seeing as they're pretty easy to play. Either that or Warlocks, Warlocks mainly because of the damage, how useful they are, how great they are in PvE.
---
Recommend? If you're going for Fast, Agile and Swift with a hint of Gunslinger, Hunter is your class.
---
If you're going for knowledge, power, fast regen and a PvE God, then go for Warlock.
---
If you're going for a tank with the ability to pinch the hell out of everything, then Titans are your best bet.
---
That's my opinion, please I'd love to hear some feedback below.
---
Thunder strike range
---
Rig is definitely still top tier imo still a must pick for tether
---
Hold up what is Cayde is one of the enemies on the moon
