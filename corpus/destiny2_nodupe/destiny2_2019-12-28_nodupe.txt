i can‚Äôt disagree with hunters being very strong in pvp. but every class can be very strong in pvp. how about built in shotguns for warlocks that have more range than shot guns and don‚Äôt require aim. also if you have a problem with what weapons people use in an rpg don‚Äôt play. people use snipers because getting a pick is an easy way to go and win the team fight. which immediately puts you 3 lives ahead. snipers aren‚Äôt over powered you just don‚Äôt know lanes or have the ability to avoid snipers.
---
---
---
Good, maybe Bungie will do something about it. Complaining on this sub doesn't do anything but it does there. Quest needs to be removed, at least the RL and shotgun kills. Trying to get HC and scout kills is almost impossible right now because of this.
---
Izanagis and Eri's Vow are both exotics, and u cant equip 2 at once
---
The heavy step? People are having an issue with it? I got it knocked out with truth in two matches. Although I've been blocking all the people who never post anything but whiny shit, so maybe that's why I haven't seen any posts about it.
---
I'm 99% sure the dude was being sarcastic but didn't get to finish the message (the countdown after the match ended). 
---

---
It was a great match. They had us 3-0, then we somehow won 4 in a row, for a win. The opposing team did have a 3rd player, but I think he went AFK and got AFK-kicked in the very last round.
---
Please make more
---
They are basiclly a virus right
---
Bruhhh I'm dumb fuck sry
---
The Rocket Launcher step, specifically, yeah.
---
GUARDIAN WAIT. BEFORE GETTING THE REST OF YOUR SIVA, IF YOU STAY IN THE CHRYPTARCH VAULT SECTION THERE IS A SECRET PUZZLE THAT AFTER DOING IT 3 TIMES,WILL GRANT YOU A SPECIAL SHIP
---
If he became hunter vanguard I don‚Äôt think hunters would even complain
---
For pvp you want a high impact frame shotgun. I played 6ish games and got like 4 shotgun kills before I grabbed my mindbenders from bank. 2 games later and I‚Äôm done.
---
I mean its an ok gun. Its not insane thom people usually pay for recovs for FOMO im pretty sure tho
---
F
---
Get a good pulse rifle. "Bygones" you can get from gambit, "go figure"  is a world drop, "right side of wrong" is a energy weapon version of go figure, also world drop.
---
What, as a company? Duh. Sega corporate was always like this.
---
Two titans, one bubble.  The erotic fan fiction no one asked for.
---
I have no issue with dusk rock, it‚Äôs just on there because that‚Äôs the majority of the load-out I see with NF. So mainly just NF, the reason I say it‚Äôs a crutch due to you needing very little recoil control to use it (on console). You just need to point and shoot for it to be effective being (I think) a high reward low effort type weapon. By no means do I think any below average player can shine but definitely an average player can pick it up and instantly be way more effective than using another hand cannon or anything within hand cannon range because of the the very little recoil it has.
---
He's Greek.
---
yea. i hate when i join a game and it already started and the game is 70-10 and then we lose and it gets counted against me for joining seconds before it gets called.
---
Enjoy all the frames!
---
I'm getting both
---
Hunters are innately good in PvP, they're easily the strongest due to ArcStrider Dodge Damage Resist, a plethora of abilities for excellent utility and more so.
---
But in all fairness, HandHeld SuperNova is pretty broke, if you have Contraverse. Otherwise it takes time to Regen, unlike others which can be nearly instant.
---
And that's why I despise people who use Revokers + NF. They pick off weakened players instead of dueling. My "PvP honor" is built off Dark Souls dueling, so I'm probably biased
---
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
The Destiny Companion App on your phone works well if Discord isn‚Äôt.
---
Same here, I'll occasionally master work weapons. Like I masterworked my trust just the other day
---
Yes.  Yes they do, because they are. Two hours for five encounters is not bad how many 980 nf you getting done in two hours? It's realistically not a bad amount of time anyway.
---
Yeah i called it the one shot master lol
---
Would actually get me to use something other then the Ophiuchus shell. Side note why are 90% of ghost/sparrow perks actually useless?
---
I completely agree, but I do think it definitely helps the average player with it having very little recoil so it‚Äôs very easy to land consecutive shots
---
Yknow it had more zoom than a tacsys sight in d1 and tacsys was like a 5x zoom I think the nlb zoom is something like 5.5x or 6x zoom
---
It is not obtainable. The quest is not supposed to appear if you did not own the Season of the Undying pass.
---
get the external drive anyways. i also have a 500 and was constantly running up against memory issues and have to choose what to delete. my gf got me a 2 tb external drive and it‚Äôs been great. d1 and d2 are the only things currently stored in the main hard drive, everything else is offline games like skyrim and they are stored on the external drive
---
Im having an issue with a map piece ive ran ordeal and original nightfalls dozens of times with no completions on the rocket launcher kills and nightfall fragment with the 100 power handicap
---
Yeah I don't mean I can never figure it out but like the new sundial/obelisk stuff was a little confusing at first. Not hard to learn but if you've literally never played destiny yeah it could be a bit much.
---
Some say "grass doesn't grow on a busy street".
---
I say "it don't grow in concrete either ".
---
Just like Cade6... oh wait
---
As a hunter I  agree with you completely!
---
Nope, it's kills.
---
I just want to turn in IB tokens, not do a fckin' quest with every type of weapon owned.
---
Beautiful good jobüëç
---
Thanks so much.
---
Makes sense... also makes sense he likes birds, just like cayde had the colonel.
---
Aah didn‚Äôt know that had a lfg function. Thanks!
---
# YOU BEST KEEP THAT SHIT AT 2 KILLS
---
The power of lag
---
Dont know, dont have it. But I can say that easily if you play supportive roles in raids you do not need to omegadps weapons. As long as the glasscannons(nighthawk hunters for instance) do.
---
As long as there isn‚Äôt a weapon of sorrow bullet in the mix it‚Äôs all in fun.
---
I relate to this big time...
---
10,000 deaths via the architects.
---
Crucible where light lvl matters
---
My kitten is obsessed with watching me play Destiny 2. Something about the graphics captures her little attention more than the other games I play. It is highly detailed I guess. The cats are right, though, it‚Äôs a great game!
---
They definitely made it a bit confusing with the numbers and helmet design but Bungie did confirm he‚Äôs Russian.
---
thank you so so much! :‚ÄôD
---
I can also no longer interact with my tower obelisk
---
wait there is a polish dub!?
---
PLEASE TELL ME YOU KNOW HOW TO CHANGE THE DUB ON XBOX
---
I'm just screwing around.
---
If a secondary school version is not made, I will slaughter 8 barons (again)
---
that last part made me read this comment in Shaxx‚Äôs voice haha, thank you!
---
I wanna see this
---
You forgot..
---
SYLOK, THE DEFILED
---
Minimum distance?
---
And kellbreaker finishers/ guardian melee kills reload this weapon and trigger momento Mori. (This may be a little op)
---
Yay, I'm not the only one! Only thing that interests me this season is rank rewards. Other than that, there's really no story to keep me occupied and sun dial just reminds me of past events. Heck, after grinding strikes to gain progress on the season 9 quest it flipped to even more grinding. All that work for a lousy shader. At least gimme the flair!
---
If they were tryharding, they would be capping points like the mode was designed for. People are trying to complete the quest so they can RNG, not win the matches.
---
Thanks. I have all the expansions and ps4 states that the game is 108.7gb.  I'll get the ext harddrive and move all other games there.  
---
I've heard that games from ext storage load faster.  Not sure if that's true
---
You get like 60 tokens a bounty
---
all you get
---
&gt;to backtrack on y
---
OMG all this, because you can't tell the differents between P.S and PS lmafo. My point stands you cant get the ornaments anymore and it would make iron banner better if you could re-release them or give us new amour.
---
Not all hunters have shit attitudes. I sure do, but not ALL of us.
---
I figured it was a nod to him being dead.
---
A 6v6 control-based timelimited gamemode (lasts a week or two at a time) where powerlevel matters. Unlike all other PvP modes where all weapons and abilities deal the same damage regardless of powerlevel, in Iron Banner you deal more damage against people below your power level and less damage against people above your power level.
---
The reward are Iron Banner tokens that you can trade in at Lord Saladin in the tower for Iron Banner weapons and armor.
---
You access it via the crucible on the map overview.
---
Thorn would be the angry sub that only wants the class quite, and would punish anyone for making any sound.
---
Terran Wind is good on pvp, though
---
I use anarchy, a firing line sole survivor and exit strategy, I always end up at the top of my team with it as far as primeval damage goes.
---
Had to read it in his voice.
---
So a gold border means it‚Äôs masterwork?  Yet another thing I never knew.
---
Didnt the quest start with the enhanced adventure in the edz.. U got the mida mini and had to get a bunch of smg kills etc to progress to the next quest to get the mida? Dont know if its changed since new light tho??
---
Void you say...is that a bubble pun good sir?
---
Why the hell does it look like fucking CoD World at War
---
WHERE
---
Shaxx would be proud Guardian
---
Any class item you have is as good as any other so it's a no brainer if it's the elemental affinity you desire it's a free 12 points across the board.
---
That season pass armour though, woah baby. With a strength mod, traction, and fully MW'ed the legs are 93 total stat points!
---
Thanks for the explanation!
---
Thats tuff
---
It's niche at best IMO.  It's fine in 6v6 but not usable in mid-high comp.
---
It is cause you are the active ps4 user. When he goes to his ps4 nothing.
---
The worst possible thing is masterworking a high roll just to get a roll one point higher the same day
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what how it was originally but like I said I have absolutely no idea how they can get it
---
this comment made me feel smarter
---
Really good at ad clearing, especially if there is void burn. Does decent damage against bosses too though.
---
Worse. A Titan.
---
The toes are different colours
---
Sait would look dope with a cape made from a bunch of purple ribbons
---
Really it‚Äôs only kinda useful in crucible sorry man
---
If it's anything like it's brethren it's super great for ad clearing.
---
50*
---
ok zoomer
---
Or getting shot by AoS?
---
Can I please know where this is coming from
---
shut up
---
Heh, saint 14‚Äôs life locked behind a paywall.
---
good! i have never seen anyone use other exotics such as huckleberry is pvp. Everyone uses the easy weapons and not the fun weapons :/
---
nothing but respect
---
Wait, what helmet is that?
---
My Titan not dumb, his massive dick and balls are using his brain for him, thats why I can shoulder charge every boss without fear.
---
Was this influenced by the pepe version of this?
---
Honestly destiny is the best community ever even with the toxic few
---
If you are on PC, I am always looking to farm 950s. Dm me and we can set it up.
---
I'm having this issue again myself. I had it awhile ago, but it seemed to fixed it after I rebooted a few times. To no avail this time. I'm not sure why, although it might have to do with resolution changes.
---
I fast travel to the gulch from the gulch. Fixes it most of the time.
---
You don‚Äôt need them anymore. 7th EP gives you the chest every time.
---
Sweet business fan club!
---
‚ÄúOEM! Stop putting tuna in the microwave you cheating whore!‚Äù
---
The season just started not too long ago, it‚Äôs not too late
---
You still have like 2 months in this season theres plenty of time
---
My brain: Special Ed
---
Ok thank you!
---
Jump on in. You'll be fine.
---
I‚Äôm druuuuuuuuunk. Just finished all
---
Bounties for IB I‚Äôm 1.5 hours this afternoon. I think. It‚Äôs
---
Ok. I like it when it comes around
---
Well this is just wrong scavenger perks absolutely work in crucible I run 2 scavenger perks on my shotgun load out and two scavenger perks on my sniper load out so I get more ammo for every green brick I pick up. The only time you dont get special ammo is if someone is running double primary weapons.
---
I thought i's troll this by posting something from the google search "saint 14 rule 34."  Im happy to report Saint 14 had zero images pop up as him.  That is how wholesome our Saint bro is
---
Nope just rng
---
well, because of him we DID break it in the end. But....
---
Whoever‚Äôs bubble pops first? Seems like a very Titan thing to do
---
thanks for the help. just wanted to have different armor sets for each character so they dont look ugly and unfitting.
---
You must have a gaming chair then.
---
Yeah no. Its virtually impossible, I've played like 30 games and I've gotten 3 rocket launcher kills because I keep getting killed while trying to camp, and none of my teammates help so I'm just gonna give up on this quest.
---
Lord salamander is a boomer
---
Yeye i know , i was just completely burned out from repeating a lost sector 60 times yesterday, found the exo on the floor and this thing made me wanna yeet myself from Hellmouth for a moment
---
Look for ‚ÄòSeason of Dawn Voice lines‚Äô on by a YT channel called Skulldor, and skip to 8:29.
---
I have some as well and I have not taken them off the cardboard thingy
---
all good man, thankyou!
---
The blue response did seem very familiar.
---
It can drop from the Eververse engrams this season. It was originally a pre-order bonus for Forsaken, I think. 
---
However, I agree with the other comment. Don‚Äôt buy engrams from Tess. You‚Äôll get them every five levels or so from the season pass. If you play a good amount, you‚Äôll probably have it by the end of the season.
---
What is all that armour? That look is fire
---
oh my gosh that‚Äôs such a big compliment! thankyou!
---
It‚Äôs used to be fucking broken in PvP, but now it‚Äôs just ok. Given the nature of its exotic perk, it‚Äôs not very reliable.
---
You barely missed
---
That and him and osiris were close too
---
FYI, I believe the increased mobility is active without another arc mod slotted, and you just have to have another arc mod slotted anywhere on your character.
---
If you have recluse or delirium or a chonky auto just go to shuro chi by using the wall of wishes in LW, and kill away. If you don't have forsaken, then you can always go to lost sector.
---
Still funny as shit
---
Of course, what‚Äôs your psn?
---
If Xur? Was good
---
Uhmm I think I'm at around 3500 or so by now. I'm not much of a PVP player honestly, I mainly do it for the quests.
---
I can‚Äôt upvote this enough. Lmfao
---
I mean yeah its not insane, but I wish they were a bit easier to kill/it had damage falloff. From my experience, theyve killed me from no charge to one hit kill charge before I could pull out my shotgun. Maybe Im just unlucky but man it hurts
---
Thanks, yeah it was a great match.
---
I couldn't figure it what was familiar!!! Thank you!
---
Can you screenshot your character build with each of your highest gear item on while holding the button that shows the power level of each visible item. On Xbox it is LT and I think L2 on PS4. Doing this will also show your power level broken down between your gear and your artifact bonus.
---
I just got put up against people only using arbalest.
---
Im not complaining because this particular match i was beating snipers at their own game with Talons of the eagle
---
Also, good for u! That's really impressive
---
The bug in the system is not appearing, maybe a useless quest at this point?
---
New subreddit???
---
Unironically running high mobility? Ewww...
---
You could wait til next season, its not like theres anything new this season, i got my rocket kills done in 3-4 games.
---
Mom please come pick me up
---
Yea, shards are better. Not sure how much more since the update tho
---
Super good tip! Thanks
---
Bruh why don‚Äôt female titans have mega booty
---
WHAT WHAT WHAT
---
I could. I just like the look of the new armor though. I‚Äôve played four games and haven‚Äôt been able to get heavy
---
Where did I claim that? You claimed he was crouch camping behind the flag, I pointed out he needs to be sprinting to should charge.
---
You claimed you want to play Destiny 2 PvP, excluding the class mechanics that Destiny 2 brings to the table. Which already exists in Halo, R6:Siege, and CS:GO, etc If all you want is to get upset because Destiny 2 doesn't conform to your expectations that's fine too. But if you want to talk shit about other people sucking, maybe do it after defeating them not the other way around.
---
How is this any different than if someone complained that CS:GO wasn't balanced because they played knife-only and kept getting domed by AWP users all day?
---
Ib, nfs for exotics, reckoning drops high stat apparently, menagerie, season pass.
---
I haven't had such luck on the rocket launcher steps but I swapped from my smg to my scout rifle for a few afk spawn kills..
---
Damn thats unlucky, i did it in i think 4 games, i dropped 5 kills in one of them, choked 3-4 rockets throughout though.
---
That‚Äôs me trying to build the ultimate load out so I can get sniper, scout rifle, rocket launcher, void, and solar kills
---
You can have 7 total. You get increased capacity from the battle pass as well. Everubody can hold 7
---
I believe this is what they call their lag protection and so that the console doesnt eat shit, that or so the server doesnt go down
---
INDEED
---
Give me an ornament that turns my helmet into a fursuit head! Bungie plz!
---
I had this permanently happen when i tried playing on my shitty laptop lmao.
---
Yeah, he sounds soooooo close to micky Rourke in ironman 2...almost forced lol
---
Is this real? Please tell me it's real.
---
Cat ears would be a big hit
---
Attempt comp? I got Unbroken
---
Not running high mobility. I was just messing around with new armor to see what I could get and ran across this. I‚Äôm a recovery/discipline kind of guy
---
Ikora gives it to you
---
I saved up the mats to upgrade it to 12 in one go so I wouldn‚Äôt have to put up with it lol
---
Neither
---
Yeah, good riddance.
---
Not the effect I was going for but ok, wise sage.
---
s2g I can never manage to get the heroic version of that scorn one in the dreaming city, where you have to shoot all the blue wispy things in the air. never done it solo lol
---
Recommendation?
---
Lord of lol
---
Anti-barrier
---
No problem! Happy hunting, guardian. o7
---
What app is this?
---
Mmmmmm whatcha say
---
Zavala is too taciturn to be wholesome,but he is more like a leader who needs absolute composure.
---
Got getaway artist with 7 discipline, 20 something strength, and 20 something Res...... Stats suck so bad in this game. Bungie knows it, that's why they gave us easy 60+ stat rolled gear in the season pass.
---
Hey, at least you got some more Essence.
---
Cool thanks for the info
---
I got a bunch of full stacks and some guy had 760+ kills just for this week. Also lots of mindbender/spare rations. And arbelast headshot maniacs
---
Pretty much just bs but I have all the weapons and most of the armor so I dont really have to worry
---
It definitely isnt the best at welcoming new players and teaching them what to do, but they do free to play really well
---
Probably because you didnt do the introduction mission on the planet to open all the fast travel locations
---
How I leave destiny. I just stop caring and don't open it
---
Grrrr
---
That was ridiculous lmao
---
What am I lookin at here, because it looks like you came across her, mindin her own business. Did you even ask to take her picture, good sir?
---
I couldnt really care much about missing a chance to spend money at the 2-3 cash shop refreshes each season.
---
I straight up melee‚Äôd  a knife the other day, I went to melee a guy, and he threw his knife, and I saw it in the center of my screen, about to hit my face, then it just disappeared. I was dumbfounded at it
---
Bruuuuuuuuhhhhh
---
That's nuts! Bet you felt like Neo then! Did you get the guy afterwords?
---
I have the same new shader on both of them.
---
[Yes, it is](https://www.fanbyte.com/guides/destiny-2-light-the-fires-guide-season-of-dawn-iron-banner-quest-steps/)
---
&gt;**Iron Banner Changes**
---
But first, let‚Äôs once again run down how Iron Banner has changed. It‚Äôll be the same system as last season, but if you haven‚Äôt played since then here‚Äôs how it works.
---
*    You still earn tokens while playing Iron Banner, but you can‚Äôt turn them in until you complete this quest line.
---
        The quest is character based and rewards Iron Banner weapons or armor with each step‚Äôs completion.
---
        Completion is tracked during the entire Season of the Undying. If you don‚Äôt complete it during this Iron Banner running, you can finish it next time.
---
*    Until the quest is completed, Iron Banner rewards can only be obtained through match drops and bounties.
---
        These will only be weapons until the quest has been completed.
---
        There are only four bounties available per Iron Banner instead of seven.
---
            These give out pinnacle rewards (up to 970) instead of powerful rewards (up to 960).
---
Same as last season.
---
Took me 3 games
---
I did, with a quick grenade throw and a shot to the body with a hand cannon
---
Dreg running peregrines greaves
---
Who holds the Tractor?
---
Leaving was easy for me. Once I saw how little effort was put into the seasons as to keep them disposable, as well as knowing that I'd be paying for content only to have it removed from the game 3 months later, I got fed up and stopped easily.
---
I also got annoyed at how they put much more effort into constantly having many new things for eververse, yet claim they don't have the resources for things like a vendor refresh. Clearly they have the resources, they'd just rather refresh the cash shop 2-3 times each season instead of refreshing the world and tower vendors more than once a year.
---
Vuvuzela
---
Please keep Rina warm
---
I did, with a quick grenade throw and a shot to the body with a hand cannon. I literally stopped playing for like 30 seconds afterwards I was so baffled
---
the moment when my ‚Äútitan‚Äù was more frail than a dreg
---
Crucible would become so satisfying if it were about shooting furries
---
Yes! Im smiling just thinking about it. Makes you feel like the coolest guardian in the crucible.
---
I think it means that match drops will only be weapons because I definitely got armor drops from my bounties. However I completed everything the first day and haven't been back on banner since
---
They said that the weapons will come back after a couple seasons
---
Sorry to say it but it probably won‚Äôt come back, unless some wacky time dial stuff happens I really doubt it
---
Let's just say I was at the wrong place at the wrong time
---
No
---
It definitely did, I still can‚Äôt believe it happened. Idk if it was just a one time fluke, or if it is a repeatable one, but I sure don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever be able to pull it off again
---
Me, after opening the image : "Aaaaaww cute"
---
My brain, seeing the small image before opening : "That's a very strange keyboard you got there"
---
Theres a good chance it will be any of the ones it is not already.
---
Get over to r/destinydadjokes you fiend
---
THATS A THING!!!
---
Wait that exists?
---
The enemy team only has 16 kills total.
---
It's up to you. You don't have anything like "main character", you can main them all. I personally main warlock, because he's kinda tanky boi in pve, which i play mostly, but i tkink that you should watch Mtashed's videos about "why play Waelock/Titan/Hunter" he made 3 months ago, so you will be completely aware of what will your choice impact.
---
So be good lmao
---
I know I‚Äôm gonna get shit on for being an asshole and I deserve it I just don‚Äôt care
---
After all, he never said it spoke to him.
---
They're exactly the same weapon
---
Without any reload perks? Probably about the same. Why don't you calm down a little bit, you are getting way to emotional over numbers in a video game.
---
You sure are easily impressed. There's nothing impressive about shooting someone with golden gun when you can see exactly where they are and when they're leaving cover.
---
laser*
---
1. Randy's throwing knife
---
2. Lord if wolves
---
3. Spare rations
---
4. Wardcliff coil
---
For anyone wondering
---
Maybe . I'm just trying to appreciate OP for whatever he did. If you don't like you can downvote whatever I said and whatever he posted
---
As far as I know, "heroic" strikes ain't in game anymore since Forsaken launch. Try normal playlist strikes instead? (From vanguard playlist, do not launch 'em from destinations.)
---
Which part of my reply to you wasn't calm? It was the exact same tone you gave me. 
---
So you're saying drawing back a bow 3 times is faster than shooting one shot from a sniper? I want you to rethink that for a moment. One shot means instantaneous. Even if you count loading the honed edge, that's still faster than 3 bow draws. 
---
Again. DPS does not = total damage. You have them confused.
---
Deathbringer made the quest super easy. Never have to worry about missing cause those orbs track forever. Equipped bubble titan to guarantee the heavy ammo and I was done the entire quest after like 3 hours.
---
I just travel back to orbit and change the date on my PS4. Works everytime, but it is damn annoying.
---
Shame. What are you going to do with all that silver left over.
---
Why would Bungie put themselves through a hell like this?
---
How the heck
---
You need to reload to get x4 izanagi, where you can keep firing the bow. I never mentioned anything about total damage, wishender in gambit is objectively better than izanagi. Again, calm down big girl, you are getting emotional over numbers  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Thanks for speaking truth!  I‚Äôll take it to heart...my son is 8.
---
then i send their head flying 3 dimensions with my godroll omniscient eye
---
Sure it was great for his team but not impressive. And I don't downvote just because someone disagrees with me, it's petty. Besides I liked the video for what it was.
---
Want to play brainlessly and do stupid stuff that should not work at all and come out victorious? Titan.
---
Want to play methodically and be the difference between life and death for your fire team? Warlock.
---
Want to play pvp? Hunter.
---
Requisition APPROVED.
---
The grenade I threw was sucked into the ground.
---
Oingo boingo?
---
Hey, I haven't seen a video in a while from them, I wonder what they're doing over on console?
---
*watches video*
---
Whelp, that's enough Reddit for today....and I just woke up.
---
This. Absolutely this. This is precisely what annoys me. You need to focus solely on yourself and your quest and it doesn't feel fitting in IB, where every player needs to put their grain of sand towards capturing and putting a solid difference in score. There's just a bunch of people running around and spamming grenades at the heavy spawn, and it doesn't feel correct (to me at the very least)
---
heroic savathun‚Äôs song
---
Superb.
---
You do and all them tokens are just there laying around till you decide to scream "fuck all" and play solo in a highly team-demanding activity. It doesn't feel right even if it is for just one step, and yeah it could be way worse (like idk 15 or 20 k instead of 10).
---
That was a grenade?!?!
---
If you have the season pass you get 64 plus armor from it. Shitty paytowin.
---
From what I‚Äôve seen they‚Äôre looking at it once they get back from holiday break.
---
And did he stop us? NO. He clarified that if anyone wanted to go then so be it, he simply wouldn't authorize it. 
---
Waging an army in the name of vengeance is fucking stupid, and our history has more than enough evidence for it.
---
Hand-held super computer
---
Yep. Tossed a grenade at the 4sec mark. Incendiary grenade I think? The one that spews a vertical line of fire.
---
I think you might have a better chance that the devs see it in r/destinythegame
---
It‚Äôs shift

Did the whole quest in less than 4 hours. The quest isn't supposed to be a walk in the park. It has nothing to do with fun. It's literally made to piss you off. Now that it has bungie is gonna make more quests just like this. Great job.
---
He‚Äôs Cheeki-Breeki Russian, tho. Not close.
---
Thanks for the reply. Will post there now
---
This is sick
---
Honestly if they kill me with their rocket in IB then good for them. One less kill they need.
---
What exactly did you team do? I can see you just used a shotty with bubble.
---
I've probably played about 24 hours worth of Iron Banner so far since it released on tuesday. It's got to a point now where I don't even care about winning because of my team. My whole objective is to camp heavy and make it harder for people the get heavy
---
What do you mean railguns and alien tech is more powerful than my weapon from 1000 years ago?
---
Haven't experienced that but I'll cross that bridge sooner or later. Thx for the heads up
---
That‚Äôs pretty cool! Thanks :)
---
Actually speakers aren't frauds. With some of the new lore it says they are gifted with the ability to see visions in their dreams. It is then up to the speaker to interpret the dream. For reference read the new lore. https://www.ishtar-collective.net/categories/book-constellations
---
So don't play it? Problem solved. Great have a blessed day.
---
It looka like anal beads
---
Used to be stuck, used Wishbringer to kill people(very hard, try to outmanoeuvre them and just shoot at point blank)
---
I'm now on the Launcher quest(getting heavy is hard as hell, beware of campers)
---
Dawning bounties
---
üòÇ Your death is for the greater good
---
Meh, that‚Äôs why I said you‚Äôd use other exotics over it, it could catch people who aren‚Äôt paying attention off guard, maybe the guy‚Äôs hard scoping a lane or sth then you could sneak in with that? It‚Äôs certainly not the best exotic to use, but again, has uses
---
GOOD WORK, GUARDIAN. KEEP IT UP.
---
I don‚Äôt think it matters where/how you buy it, if I‚Äôm understanding your question correctly, the Shadowkeep content will be added to whatever you already have. 
---
I think there‚Äôs a Deluxe √©dition with 4 season passes included if you‚Äôre ever interested! (Might be for Forsaken I‚Äôm not sure)
---
You‚Äôre not wrong.
---
Ya I guess. I enjoy the free headshots in comp. I use claws with armor built into the melee and just fire the new solar melee around all match. It's really fun lol
---
I‚Äôm new to the game, what is iron banner?
---
Or everyone gets a golden gun, infinite ammo
---
"3, 2, 1, Draw."
---
You need to change console language or buy a physical copy with the Polish dub
---
More like die to a guy with some rocket launcher 2 minutes into the game
---
the quest got a nerf for a while, so it is absolutly easy by now...;)
---
Look at D1 and D2. Both servers are still going and people post stuff from D1 on this subreddit occasionally. 
---
Here's to hoping they delay D3 for awhile. Bungie really needs to keep their game polished. Not like this buggy season we are currently going through.
---
Clearly you haven‚Äôt seen Not Forgotten with Crucible Glory(I think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called)
---
Insert laughing emoji with open eyes
---
It should be noted that in Iron Banner level advantages between players are enabled, whereas in regular crucible they‚Äôre disabled. It‚Äôs sort of a celebration of the strong.
---
i wanted to say thank you to all the people that said they are ready to help someone out with raids.
---
I rush cuz for the bounty of 5 strike bosses. But hey, the faster u get done, the less strikes I'll ruin for others. And I kill everything. Just way faster than my blueberry teammates. Get messaged all the time can u slow down. I just politely tell them no
---
So it is 55 base? Good stat rolls though. Hmm.
---
That‚Äôs what I use Phonto to add images, regular editing to add text.
---
I love it!
---
‚ÄúSo I just went in knifes blazing‚Äù
---
Its not the AoS therefore I don‚Äôt care.
---
No he won't be able to get it because Energy costs. Powerful friends gives mobility only if another arc mod is equipped, so he needs that scavenger and traction won't fit.
---
Nightfall tge Ordeals are similar to Heroic Strikes. The "carded" nightfalls are configurable with difficulty mods, but no champions. The Five of Swords also had the ammo modifier removed, making the 200k score threshold a bit harder to maintain.
---
You can always re-aquire one from xur if you delete it, rite?
---
That too. But luckily I'm at 950+ now so most are below me. I personally recommend playing PvE or normal Crucible until 900 or 920-930 and then focusing on events and stuff, skipped the last Iron Banana because of this.
---
Mom get the camera!
---
Okay but Republic Credits are no good out here.
---
[Meanwhile me](http://puu.sh/EU3g8.png)
---
But NF doesn't feel like a Hand CANNON, it does have the look, but it does not have the recoil a Hand Cannon deserves
---
Nice! I haven't played recently because the last three weeks were dead week, finals week, and a week of vacation lmao
---
Honey just use &lt;3
---
Nobody has. Except apparently OP.
---
Why kill atheon last? Wouldnt opening the doors be last?
---
Ah that‚Äôs right. I went last week, so I‚Äôve just been dismantling it when I get it.
---
Got a point it just does feel sticky
---
Still better than hearing Arbalest
---
This is the fastest way to farm fractals.
---
You know, like those curved yellow thingermajigs?
---
This hits home. Need a 4 game win streak to finish it off this season.
---
Damn!
---
Issa joke
---
I would really like NPCs to not talk that much (or at least have more than 2 phrases recorded). Makes standing in the tower feel like Chinese torture, just waiting for the next update on Fenchurch.
---
Important question for the lore-diggers.
---
An Exo is essentially reset when they change the number after their name correct? And they lose most of the memories of themselves before. Ada-1 has not been reset even once, so she should have complete memories of everything since she was turned into an Exo, including the Blackstone Crypt, the Golden Age (at least the ending bits) and the darkness. So why isn't she more important, or ever even once asked about this?
---
Hol' up
---
Destiny 2 LFG PC discord is literally the biggest one as far as I‚Äôm concerned. I haven‚Äôt used any other LFG site or server other than that. So far my success rate has never gone below 95%. However I can‚Äôt guarantee if the lfg you joined is toxic or not
---
The sooner we all get those kills the sooner we can get back to playing the game how we want to
---
Amazing artwork !
---
Thats badass
---
I saw one when loading into Mars one day. I think it's just existing markers not having been populated with text yet.
---
What are these for?
---
**Light for All**
---
##ARC MISSLE,
---
#SMASHHHHH!!!!
---
Iron Banner is currently my favourite game mode. Not sure why but I just like playing it without even thinking about any rewards. Don't know why it gets so much hate.
---
really? cause i seem to be doing pretty damn fucking well with it
---
so please do tell me "it's not debatable that it's trash"
---
continue to do so and i will continue to keep winning matches with my set up
---
you do you
---
You don't look too banged up
---
Another issue is if it looks too good people would go for that free nice looking armor, instead of the new limited time ornaments eververse will sell you. And well....You know....Money.
---
Petition to make Trials of Saint-14?
---
I don't know where my uncle gets the wares.
---
The first part is fine, its the rocket launcher bit that's cancer
---
What hand cannon is that?
---
Kinda looks like a cat
---
Well duh cause you can't pick it up if you don't need it.
---
If the kids don't have any Phsaeglass Needles and Ikea pencils they can get run over by cars for all I care ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
All good! Haven't listened to them in years, so maybe I'll make my way back around. Thanks!
---
Up until this point, I didn't even bother with rocket launchers so i don't really have that. Also New Light player here so I don't think I even can :(
---
What I will do is start hoarding Grenade Launchers and Trace Rifles for next season's potential annoying ass quest step.
---
I think that same blue set in d1 was also almost identical to multiple legendary sets though
---
He didnt refer to the armour, but the shader on the armour (the colors)
---
Anyone else feel vaguely disturbed by this pic?
---
No, just me...
---
Poor Eva, she doesn't want a fetish stalker, does she?
---
I like hot buns I cannot lie , you other Guadians can‚Äôt deny
---
That was very Plus Ultra of you
---
Instead of baby yoda it‚Äôs now baby riven
---
It's just best to not do it all in one sitting
---
Thankfully, I've never gone up against an Unbroken. Here's to never seeing their scary asses in my games because that just sounds like a nightmare.
---
inb4 "stop calling titans crayon eaters"
---
Couple bounties, few strikes some iron banner, done.
---
Cool I will check it out bro
---
Well, at least Saladman is honest. Also Iron Banner is Control, so I can get good weapons without being forced to play a gamemode I despise with every iota of my being.
---
For your sake I wish I could. Had to buy this season though, but got all DLC. Maybe they run it for New Years. You never know.
---
Yes that‚Äôs my point, I think the armor already looks like that
---
Thanks guys
---
JoJo‚Äôs is great, I‚Äôm a big fan of the show. However, references must be used with context. Just saying that randomly isn‚Äôt funny. Especially that specific reference, which is about as basic as it gets. Please, don‚Äôt be that guy.
---
Cluster bomb is a perk (one of the circles to choose from) on the gun that does the best damage wise for rocket launchers
---
yeah but kilts go all the way around
---
butt capes give a great view from the front
---
Yeah, but the standard shader on it is most likely aviable to get
---
Yea a lot of things online say that it‚Äôs ok, but not great
---
I think it's the crucible stuff from last season with Atlantic rush for season of the drifter?  Apart from the Cape which is the emperyean cartographer Cape with I think the pure gold leviathan shader?
---
Yeaa I figured it would be easy so I grinded it a while back
---
I only met 1 hacker since shadowkeep. It was a guy diring a pulse rifle like an autorifle
---
Yea I did about a month ago, now I‚Äôm trying to figure out what‚Äôs next
---
My fireteam says thanks! This was from yesterday when we all played iron banana!
---
Ok, thanks! I was going to do a nightfall with my friend but he said that I didn‚Äôt have enough good stuff ;-;
---
United States of Smash !!!!!
---
How about dps wise?
---
Trust me this wasn't bad connection.  You cant bounce from a flag all the way to the c then back that fast
---
Tractor cannon is my personal favorite
---
It wasnt worth  it :/
---
I did this yesterday too! Safety First kinderguardians, always follow the bright orange titan
---
Figured it out. Do 920 nightfalls. I‚Äôm getting like 10 bosses every time now. Better scores too.
---
I, sir, am an idiot. Got the two mixed up. Will be deleting this monstrosity. Ty lol
---
I haven't seen it.
---
Take your time. Kill everything and focus your attentions when champions appear. This is one of the easiest NF‚Äôs to beat at 980 and get 100k on 950.
---
Saint-14 is pretty cool.
---
&gt;And then you have people who me who bakes cookies for Zavala, whether he likes it or not.
---
I got 14 kills and no deaths last season. I kept looking around to see if somebody else was playing for me.
---
Prime.
---
Everyone out here talkin city age vs golden age
---
Like bro I want Vex Weapons! Why the fuck can't I launch suicidal harpies yet? We got Fallen, Cabal, Hive, and even fucking *taken* weapons
---
How low is your light level? People are doing this at abysmally low light lvls because it auto matches with other low lvls. If someone is doing this at your lvl the afk timer (4min inactivity) will kick them because the forge takes 2 min to time out if no one throws a ball. And the afk kick does not reque like timing out a forge does. This hurts no one and i highly doubt you're seeing THAT many as anyone doing this trick KNOWS to do it low. Otherwise it literally ends after 4min.
---
......nvm thats omnigul isnt it?....
---
I got that recently and havent had time to try it out, will definitely give it a look.
---
It‚Äôs 10 kills for the last step
---
Just get a boss CP and run it 3x in a row. Then have teammates use characters (instead of switching to alt) that already got it that week until you are victorious
---
I don't. I was being iron-ic. Was killed with a warlock meelee but the only guardian near me on death was a Titan behind a wall. Mean the warlock either had terrible internet or was able to tekeport around the map. Wasn't the funniest of comments, made less funny having to explain it
---
I need to get a ton of dawning essence. My God is that difficult
---
Repost

Im looking kinda dumb right now i guess we're not fast enough :o

Cool thx. Much appreciated. :)

Poor Sundance.

One day ;)

PSYLOCK, THE DEFILED
---
Yeah i wasn‚Äôt trying to be funny you just didn‚Äôt put a /s and your sarcasm wasn‚Äôt easy to tell
---
Yeah but why is it just a guy staring
---
i got feeding frenzy quickdraw.
---
Tilted basically means make someone get pissed off. Like when you wipe in the last part of the Xenophage quest you would be tilted
---
The person who made that fuckin quest was baked, not the quest itself.
---
I‚Äôve gotten pretty heavily into some melodic/symphonic metal. 
---
Be sure to check out my buddy‚Äôs band! They‚Äôve been touring with some pretty big names for the past few years. 
---
https://youtu.be/tYGXh9gyROA
---
No?
---
Step into Iron Banner and let me know how you feel. 
---
Lol for real though in most PvP modes power level means nothing, but modes like Iron Banner it does and you will feel the difference when you are behind.
---
Every season yes. So last IB was season 8 while now it's season 9.
---
So when IB comes back in a month or so you won't have to do the quest again (if you finish it this week). The quest is also per character
---
Nah you‚Äôre good homie. Just take your time. Don‚Äôt rush into anything. Stay back and keep the enemies at a distance. Izanagi‚Äôs or Whisper + Divinity is probably the best combo.
---
She‚Äôs still hot
---
Not really original, I've seen at least 6 of these on this subreddit and I don't even browse by new
---
My first new light exotic.
---
... I don‚Äôt know whether to be upset and downvote you or to educate you on where this from.
---
I got the whisper without the catalyst, im very bad at headshot ahah
---
Haha we actually have a discount code, you don't HAVE to pay that rediculous amount lol
---
...unless?
---
Destiny 2 is a great game for this. You can chill with the homies when you want, but also have a really good time solo
---
That is fucking adorable!
---
He's falling into a volcano and that's a face that has seen some shit...
---
Wait, I just bought 2! What discount???
---
Baby riven is the new baby yoda
---
I seen several posts about Ib being bugged.  Try and reload into a new queue.
---
Like most people said, just prioritize the stats you want and the affinity. I usually run a good helm/arms/chest and arc legs/class item. If it has solar or high resilience it‚Äôs an auto dismantle for me.
---
I follow this with exceptions. I don't care about strength, so a 60 stats points with 16 into strength it's worst than a 53 with 4 points into strength. I consider the stat as wasted points.
---
DeLIGHTful
---
Nice
---
I think it‚Äôs actually the connection to other players that‚Äôs making it take so long since D2 doesn‚Äôt have dedicated servers. 
---
Some matches start right away for me other times the black screen will sit for a few mins while all the players get connected.
---
Many thank
---
That's the Power weapon right? Gallant Charge is not just a Fusion Rifle, would that count?
---
I got Volume one for Christmas :)
---
Absolutely terrible quest. I can suffer through Scout and Shotgun kills. This was a whole new level of torture. Maybe only 5 rocket kills or 10 total heavy weapon kills next season. Hey at least we get tons of gear for this season and I get an updated Efrideet‚Äôs Mantle.
---
Not available until later in the season to allow a catch up for players with less play time compared to allowing people to pay their way to all the bonuses on day one.
---
Yes for sure good point.
---
I personally only care about mobility, recovery and resilience - in that order.
---
 But I'm a titan PVP whore - it depends on what you're trying to do üòé
---
It's a tired joke that's been beaten so far into the ground you need to ride an elevator for 2 hours to get to the corpse.
---
Random drop from playing activities
---
I mean it's fine, it's just not as nearly optimal as other weapons are.
---
Yo can get 91,000 easily at 920. I assume a 950 run should give you the 100,000
---
Like what other weapons?
---
Don't feel like talking,  getting messages,  or just forget my son switched me to ninja.  Regardless,  I have fun.
---
May he live on in all of us. Thank you guardian.
---
Not bad kid
---
It's the same power level
---
I finished it in like 4 games with zero rage. There is no way people are being this dramatic about the quest.
---
Reeeeepost
---
Yeah, had to completely quit D2 and reload.  it started counting after.  Thanks!  Got the bounty in 2 matches after doing this!
---
If they are that brain dead just imagine how dumb his team is as it looked most of them where dead
---
Legit I‚Äôve switched from a hunter main to a titan main because I didn‚Äôt like being the annoying jumpy asshole who‚Äôll double throw their smoke and grenade on someone.
---
"I'm out! Whose kidneys are these?"
---
Thank you, I just wanted the good stat roll armour and I‚Äôm impatient! üòÖ
---
How do you access checkpoints? I did Riven‚Äôs delivery just a bit ago using the code wall or whatever would that work for the checkpoint? I don‚Äôt want to enter the code again lol
---
The heavy quest step is the DUMBEST thing ever in this game, 5 games of iron banner now in a row and both teams are just sitting at heavy not playing obj.. doing nothing but fighting for heavy
---
Yeah the other two subclasses are playable with the shoulder charges but really aren‚Äôt the best for pvp IMO
---
Not the Zenobia?!!! Get ready to get a thousand more
---
I don't see why they would.
---
Because there were so many posts like this...
---
That was kinda unnecessary
---
Show this picture everytime somebody says that playing this game on PC requires skill.
---
Why?
---
Unless bungie adds another way to increase the amount of links, nope.

Gallant charge is a fusion, not a Linear Fusion, so it won‚Äôt count.

Neither. Fractal-ine. Pronounced same way as line, spine, done. Etc.
---
Mess with the stonks you get the bonks
---
This is the wrong place for this
---
Pretty sure it's the original crucible set for the hunter. It's called Swordflight4.1 I think.
---
sometimes...
---
Mmmmm shotty underbarrel
---
Im not saying stormcaller is bad but compared to the other subclasses its nowhere near as good.In crucible nova blink with top/middle tree or dawnblade is so much better than any arc subclass.Raids/ dungeons Well is the go to or nova.top tree.dawn blade/well is the best for nightfall.Arc subclasses arent bad but theyre outclassed by the others.Middle tree arc also isnt as good as nova top for dps and not great  in crucible or add killing so its never the best to choose
---
How much did you heal their Primeval?
---
You thought it was Saladin, but it was me, Dio
---
honestly the scoring system doesnt make sense in gambit... guardian kills dont count as much as they should in there!:) gj man keep it up (but not when youre in my enemy team pls)
---
He got every right to complain. Gambit should have a solo option, just like survival does.
---
The only good rewards from it are the pinnacle rewards from the bounties. Which can realistically be done in a day per character.
---
Why can‚Äôt the guardians in the Crucible be more like you?
---
rng
---
Those opponents are legitimately awful. Not bad, awful
---
Who? I don‚Äôt know who that is.

Both have no life lmao

That‚Äôs super cool, you did a really good job

Lmao thanks dude and I totally agree but whatever, at least it has a guardian kill counter on there

Anime character

Played 2 matches then left it alone. I don‚Äôt like being blown up every 30 seconds lol

I got sweet business and actium war

rig to drop for me within a week of each other.

I knew what the game was trying to tell me. The trigger is still held down to this day.
