I'm going to reach level 50 before the main destiny campaign even starts by playing crucible I
---
---
---
I‚Äôm not even sure that /s is necessary. By the time the menu loads you‚Äôve already been locked it
---
I can make another and sell it to you lol
---
You're breathTaken.
---
Thought I was the only one who is terrified of them above all other characters in the game
---
don't tell me please, for my sake and for yours, that you're doing 0-50 in the EDZ only.
---
I did it legit and used the iron banner grenade launcher and play of the game. I didn‚Äôt really have trouble with the double kills so I focused on calculated trajectories with play of the game. Most of the double kills and medals would be with heavy so make sure you always try to grab it. I got 7 calculated trajectories in one game once with heavy. Try to get 1 or 2 kills with it and finish with the other grenade launcher if you have to. Also I used spike grenades on my special grenade launcher and went invisible with my hunter to try to get up close.
---
What did the quest give at the time?
---
I just revisited this post, and I just love how no one really cares about these changes anymore with all the latest news that has been surfacing.
---
It gave a powerful item from the package you got from the associated vendor (ikora/drifter) and then drop an enhancement core if you sided with the vanguard or some synths if you sided with the drifter.
---
What are you trying to say?
---
You can also get 100% damage for being the only one shooting the primeval when it spawns... Because the rest of the team are *shooting the envoys* and the other team melts their primeval. Seriously, the amount of people that ignore envoys, even after they added dialogue about it.
---
Shoulda put ‚ÄúGreat minds think alike‚Äù
---
You don't like game mode. Don't play game mode. 
---

---
Game is not for loot. Game for fun
---
It will make pvp much, much harder because more people will have it.
---
Yeah, I get you. üòÖ
---
Or at least add Dark mode
---
This one‚Äôs my favorite
---
No in crucible and in the EDZ
---
Shadowkeep _ends_ like this. Where you get knocked out because the Darkness suppresses your Light and Ghost goes into hibernation. Then Zavy finds you and this...
---
Did you watch the ViDoc?
---
Ah! There's the gatekeeping I was looking for. 
---
Yea no, I took a two month break, came back for the new content and found it boring. Cept they raised the power cap _again_ which means I gotta grind it out in preperation for Shadowkeep in the hopes _that_ brings something actually new and different than 'Raidlite.'
---
What if I don‚Äôt want to?
---
Honestly just bc it‚Äôs on sale it‚Äôs worth it.
---
I didn't realize you could go from empty mag to 4x honed edge like that, I've always had to reload twice
---
Odd..
---
Complete the forsaken campaign and reach the dreaming city
---
Extremely helpful for the outbreak runs. Burns through shielded shanks like crazy.
---
You can use the power surge quest line offered by Benedict on the tower to immediately get to 690 power. You need to have Forsaken to be able to do it. The top tier loadout right now is a combination of ‚ÄúThe Mountaintop‚Äù Grenade launcher, ‚ÄúThe Recluse‚Äù sub machine gun, and ‚ÄúWendigo Gl3‚Äù grenade launcher. All of these are lengthy quest lines but are worth it.
---
Easily the best music of D2 by far.
---
Definitely a steal for the summer while you prepare for shadowkeep in the fall.
---
Hopefully there's a grave there instead
---
Hunter can't find right spot to activate fist bump
---
Or confuse the enemy
---
High key use the the min tool over recluse in menagerie since it has threat detector and feeding frenzy + the many solar shields.
---
‚ÄúDestiny wall‚Äù thanks for the inspiration!.... will start a destiny wall now
---
I need that picture
---
Zones are shard based, with pop caps, you yet thrown in fresh ones when it fills. Also while D2 sold more on PS4 and XBONE, PC has the highest concurrent player base.
---
That‚Äôs rng telling you it was a bad throw.
---
Nay! Kay is bae!
---
Ask any questions about anything used in the run or anything else! I'll try my best to answer them &lt;3
---
If they don‚Äôt also fix LoW at the same time I‚Äôll be very moderately peeved
---
Also I‚Äôm genuinely not touching comp until it‚Äôs fixed unless I have a 4-stack of my friends
---
I suppose you could either wait for daddy datto to test them, or do it yourself if you have one!
---
Progress in the shattered throne is saved until it goes away and comes back 2 weeks later, at the weekly reset on tuesday
---
Wendigo arc, outrageous solar, swarm void. Set for life. Til nerfs.
---
I would too if I had it
---
Ok cool - I ran a Valakadyn for the quest and just shot at enemies piled up together and the multikills were there. I think the gap between kills to count is between 1-3 seconds iirc
---
Seems a bit silly to me. Would you not enjoy a film because other good films were released at the same time?
---
Thank you ! Will check it out. I‚Äôm on my phone so its different here I think.
---
I thought it was count not time
---
Hello there
---
Nope, I'm on mobile. Theres also a post on destinythegame subreddit. Idk how to link on mobile otherwise I would

I never left her. Been my primary in PvP. Because full auto wrecks.
---
You're right.  They should just let Bygones be Bygones.
---
I went behind all of them üòÅ but things didn‚Äôt go as planned when
---
agreed. very annoying.
---
i can‚Äôt talk i use hammerhead, it was just how toxic his response was, he then went on to say how whiny destiny players are
---
Wtf
---
Who‚Äôs BA GAMING?
---
I finally did it this week too, and beat Dul Incaru with almost the exact same loadout (except being a warlock) the Izanagi's burden is great for killing the knights and DPS, and the recluse is for killing psions, while the heavy is mostly for the big crystal. Congrats to you!
---
badass gaming is a semi big destiny content creator and is known for making funny content and raid commentaries. Also if you know Chibirobo his is friends with him and they often play together.
---
*Haunted loads* Gun's moon

Me: Dies inside
---
Vex: beep milk lol kill kill 
---
So. Many. Wasted. Grenades.
---
Lol, that‚Äôs another plus having a support role of some sort even if it‚Äôs the controlled demolition ability regen is rewarding to me. In reckoning on the bridge with void singe it was very useful.
---
Nah leave shotgun 8 meters is perfect it was annoying when dust rock was 11-12. 
---
But you are right a fusion shouldn‚Äôt kill at 62 meters.

Because I need to finish the sniper pinnacle quest.
---
**Boi be Clappin'**
---
This is probably the best map for recluse. Everything is perfect range where if you play it right you‚Äôre out of shotty range and can just keep melting, it‚Äôs amazing
---
Fuck ‚Äòem. Like Noseworthy said, they‚Äôre focusing Destiny on the people who play Destiny. It‚Äôs not about bringing new people in or old people back. It‚Äôs about creating an experience for the people who stayed, and everyone can see for themselves and choose for themselves.
---
Like i guess , but still.
---
this made me laugh
---
fuuuuk mee
---
I third this, recluse has become my go to, especially with OeM! The grind isn‚Äôt hard! I‚Äôm a 1.25 K/D pvp player and far from amazing and have little straight plays other then go hard. Many games I was carried through in comp!
---
Yeah swarms only really better if someone is running tractor. So without it it‚Äôs pretty even with everything else.
---
yh my friend got sword on 1st aswell :(
---
You mean lord of wolves players who abuse broken "shotguns" more like insta kill pulse rifle
---
Fabled is def super attainable now since they doubled the points you get for wins and losses. Just grind solo till about 1400 range and find a team for the rest. Just need a streak or two and you‚Äôre there.
---
Yea, recluse is totally amazing. Sad thing is, the time period I'm alloted to play is semi-short. Then I typically always managed to find the absolute hardest of the try hard sweats every queue lol.
---
Fix Lodd of Wolves bs
---
I see this.  . . And I think  . . . Cookies!
---
I got stompeez out of the fated engram last week, but I've been using the shit out of them and I'm on a 4 streak in solo queue comp so it's not a big deal. These ones might even be a better roll.
---
Last week was doubled so this is right I believe
---
No, maybe for the Mida catalyst but not for NF. Just reach legend.
---
All year 1 is free, you keep your loot regardless of where it came from, and you only need to buy Forsaken if you want to play stuff that you can‚Äôt access in patrol. It‚Äôs weird, but you can patrol any planet or area for free. Idk how to exactly explain it. But prob only the raid, campaign, and some other stuff will be locked behind buying forsaken, same with annual pass, but strikes are free
---
Terrebah is a budget recluse. Alternatively get yourself a kill clip trackless waste. If you use it right and can play well it can outpace an average recluse player. Next up is a back up plan/quickdraw swash buckler epicurion, alternatively loaded question is a strong option. Merciless too. Anarchy/wendigo/outragous fortune. Not a tractor swarm but not far off either. Love him or hate him check out rustopholis on youtube to see what a trackless waste can do.
---
Every Friday to Monday homie lol
---
Pick up where you left off.
---
*Loads into the game* Screen's Haunted
---
Alright, thank you for explaining it
---
Mountain top/comp cheese while frowned on. Is pretty accessible and free
---
I don‚Äôt see where the bragging rights come from. You won, but you had the fewest advantage kills, and BA had 5 more kills than you overall. I‚Äôd bet good money you were stream sniping, or how would you know he was complaining afterwards?
---
Not quite worthy of the virtual pat on the back you seek.
---
Are you using catalyst
---
Bruh

I got some luck this afternoon winning three games in a row, which means something terrible is going to happen like a plane crashing into my house

I'm sorry the red string jade looking one from season of the drifter...

I understood that reference
---
My boi shot Gahlran with one as I put up my titan barricade. We can see him get all "voidy" and stuff.
---
It might roll around in one of the weekly inventory things but I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs very likely to do that.
---
Tell me a primary that one shots consistently
---
Grenades already do this.
---
Who cares , literally everyone posts pictures of there seals coming in the mail. The mods don‚Äôt seem mad so he should be good
---
Thanks mate....I should have gotten it last season,but I just hated it so I Did not play at all until Opulence dropped...
---
Ahh shit, We've woken the hive again.
---
It‚Äôs a 2v4
---
I get that dark humor is a deep love here on the internet, really, I do. But there are some memes, like this one, I kinda wish would just disappear. It's just so... tasteless.
---
I had that a few matches ago where I was the last one on the awoken map and killed everyone with my bow lol. I went to defuse the bomb and just shook my control back and forth(implying a smh) at anyone who was watching
---
Destiny loads, ears shot
---
It is going to probably unlock the bad juju mission
---
Good thing this super is so ridiculous in PvP and yet so ridiculously useless in PvE. The damage is pitiful.
---
Amazing description of crucible
---
Traction is for pussies. Fight like a real hunter
---
Not today
---
This is Doctor Who right? Should I start watching Doctor Who?
---
How did You get up there???
---
I actually commented something like this in another post. I think we should get a last mission in Crota's ascendant plane not a strike though
---
Get over it and play smart. Yeah its a tough quest but ffs bitching about aint gonna get it done will it? Blame the meta all you want....sounds like you just suck imo.
---
Same here
---
It‚Äôs a rant about PVP if you didn‚Äôt want to see complaints don‚Äôt read past the title of
---
‚ÄúThe last word quest is stupid (part 2)‚Äù 
---
Which in of itself is a complaint but shows what the entire rest of the post will be about but regardless that‚Äôs your opinion
---
Let me guess, you use all the things I was bitching about don‚Äôt you?
---
I didn‚Äôt say that I don‚Äôt want to see complaints. I enjoy a good rant and complaint. But yours are pathetic.

I am not playing because i am poor and dont have the dlc's i only have free battle.net version

NGL, that would at least make mercury fun. Think of the start of strikes when it stops you in patrol!
---
You know what really hurts? When destiny drops a ton of cool content and intresting new things to do but your just so burnt out of destiny that youve only played it once since season of opulence dropped
---
I don't like headsets either. I don't understand how people find that comfortable. But i am also no hardcore player so...
---
I just don't have anyone to play with anymore. I'm not that into flying solo.
---
Good to see someone taking classes in my native language.

I have gotten it with but I think it is threat detector
---
The thing only increases the chance of finding runes; the drop isn't guaranteed.
---
To be fair though the dlc's cost really stacks up, and as a teenager i cant alwqys affors that stuff which lowers my drive to play thr game since i know ill never be on paar with the people who have the newest dlc and are 150 light ahead of me
---
Join a clan boi. Make more friends, that's what I did and the game been given a new lease on life.
---
It has sniper perks this time, no one that uses One-Eyed Mask would want it
---
I bought the pass, played through black forges, and took a break.  Follow the Reddit and try to keep up with updates and changes, and I'll be back when something interests me or my friends get reacquainted.
---
I've got several games like that on my list.  No harm in.  Destiny is just not the game I want to play right now.
---
I do like these life service games though.  I love going back to a game months later and having new shit.  Used to be only MMOs did that.
---
Would also like another suggestion than the usual Targeting adjuster.
---
1 not using a special in this meta 
---
2 they arent supposed to thats the point of special and primary if you don't get that people mean special weapons with oneshot weapons you're an idiot 
---
3 with a HC you can easily get two shots off before they turn around or know where you are especially if you have explosive payload with a 180 you can get 3 off and with any other weapon you can do the same
---
#ZAWURDO
---
It's funny because if it were easier, you strike me as the type to trash the game for making it too easy...
---
LOL
---
Why would you want threat detector if you have feeding frenzy?
---
That's not a gun meme.  Also these memes are idiotic.

Huh I could have swarm I still received the points last season but that could have very well been before I hit 3500 feels like along time ago now..
---
I've heard it only gets good after forsaken and I don't have the extra income to just drop on that right now.
---
Sounds like a filthy casual wants people in crucible to give him matches.
---
DLC doesnt redeem any game because the fact that you are paying twice for a game is more backward than my bunny fucking a fisb to get a chimp as their firstborn.
---
Possibly, I‚Äôm just not a fan of paying for the same stuff multiple times because they chose to remove or not bring forward in the first place, it just seems like an extremely shady tactic to me.
---
You can pull it out of collections with traction friend.
---
Maybe I‚Äôll finally go into Competitive
---
For all the non titan normies out there, it says: ‚Äúyou talk mad sh*t for someone in melting point‚Äù
---
No. It says special ammo right There.
---
Compared to when?
---
I played til the end of the Osiris DLC then returned for Forsaken for about 2 weeks, then gave up again. The 'new' content is just reskinned old shit so the gimmick lasts for like a week or two? TBF I did enjoy crucible when I replayed on my brother's PC the other week, and was going to repurchase on PC in September. Unfortunately Borderlands 3 is the same week, and Borderlands 2 was infinitely better than both Destiny games so it's no contest
---
Ur points are weird, I'll go through them all.
---
1. Special - chaperone/good bone struct cant oneshot if they have overshield. Erentil needs more bolts. And not every OEM user is a potato so dont expect your teammates to NEVER lose a 1v1 gunfight to an oem titan. You arent the best player in the world. With an overshield, you are clearly at a disadvantage.
---
2. If they have wallhacks (because you shot them first) , and they hide in a corner, and you collapse on him , he might crouch with a slug shotgun / erentil with low charge time , and precharge/chaperone 1 shot you. Erentil + OEM is broken, you cannot push them since a good OEM user knows how to precharge.
---
3. Same as point 2. Also, thorn requires one extra shot to kill in overshield.
---
4. if they are rushing towards you , and they have the mark on you, they are clearly at an advantage. Chaperone headshot, erentil, or even last word spam. 
---
5. NO, one eyed is not about outshooting the opponent. Its about playing at a disadvantage. If you are up against a person who is at the same skill level as you, then it is simple facts - you will lose because every OEM user will play to their strengths - bait to get shot, activate wall hacks , and then only push you.
---
6. Other exotics ? You mean antaeus wards which can deflect an entire nova bomb, or dunemarchers, synthoceps, ursa. So many great exotics, that if OEM was grayed out, it would still not be a problem.
---
Your entire argument is based on you being a better player, and the OEM users being absolute potatoes. Clearly , you have never played mythic+ comp. A 4stack of unbrokens running OEM - I have seen them play, and they play passive-agressive mostly. There is a reason why OEM is banned in scrims - it gives a big tactical advantage in 3v3 scrims, 4v4 comp . Just because you faced absolute potatoes who dont know how to use OEM and make callouts does not mean it does not deserve a nerf.
---
In my experience LFG groups are really difficult to get into when you're brand new to end game content. Even in a clan most players expect you to have done the content and would rather take someone who knows what they're doing.
---
Damn, so true
---
About to attempt the same this weekend.  Wish me luck!
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true, since shadowkeep is a stand-alone expansion and you don‚Äôt need any other expansion to play it. It‚Äôs just $35
---
I got max light and I stopped playing.  PvP was the only thing keeping me but i got sick of it. It doesn't feel good, and the guns I want to use are too inconsistent.
---
And then proceed to say the game is bad
---
Yeeted the chest after a public event into another player and he died. 11/10 would do it again.
---
There sure as hell will be on Tuesday
---
THAT SCARED THE LIVING SHIT OUT OF ME!!!
---
hey you saved ~20 LS
---
nobody here has done heroic menagerie, you're wasting your time :)
---
Thank you for the advice!
---
I‚Äôm surprised nobody is questioning why I‚Äôm using the Trials Sniper. Lol
---
I hit this a few days ago and have made the bright decision of finally going and getting a Beloved with a decent enough roll and I‚Äôm already at 3000 total glory for the Pinnacle Sniper now.
---
You should be able to play the stuff you paid for already.
---
If it has ammo it‚Äôs a gun.
---
He is referring to the mighty swords we plant into the ground, enough damage can destroy the sword and no more well.
---
I want to come back but I‚Äôm afraid of being so far behind in light level
---
With Destiny 2: New light coming this September when shadow keep drops you should have access to gambit prime &amp; menagerie and all future content but stuff like raids and exotic quests that come out with the annual passes you shouldn't be able to access like the Crown of Sorrows Raid
---
True i didnt think about that ü§î
---
We say "Took you long enough."
---
It kind of looks similar in design but different. It's like they wrapped Thorn around something.
---
Loose subscribers are the worst!
---
The funny fact is I have played d2 since launch
---
Honestly, use whatever you want. I normally rock triple nade launchers with Mountaintop, Fighting Lion, and Wendigo. Great way for me to keep progressing my FL kills (just passed 20k) while still being able to contribute since I love grenade launchers (been using them religiously since Curse of Osiris). Menagerie is pretty laid-back PvE content, you really don‚Äôt need to take in a raid-style load-out.
---
I dont use one eyed mask because... i believe it is a cheap exotic. But i snipe and want the roemote connection. Tho i already have kne that does. If i use OEM i want the remote connection because i can make aggressive pushes but also remain in the background.
---
You know what hurts? Purchasing the original D2 deluxe edition for $100....
---
CUTE
---
Yeah i need to get the transponder to start quest but the heroic adventure never shows up
---
Makes sense, thanks
---
The trials sniper is pretty good. I mainly play on PC now but I used to snipe a lot on console. I prefer aggressive frame snipers because they feel most comfortable to me. But practice is key along with recording games and rewatching them and seeing your mistakes. Helps you improve your game sense and positioning.
---
Huh, TIL you can actually shoot a well down.
---
F
---
10 shards, 85 dust and no clan.......
---
Sad face anime
---
I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre better than what you would make
---
OOoOooOoOOOooOoOoOoO
---
Um, false?
---
Does it only proc Demo when you first use Arc Buddy or does it proc Demo everytime Arc Buddy shoots?
---
You don't need the heroic. Patrol works just fine as long as you have the Enemy of my Enemy triumph. Got the transponder from patrol myself just today
---
Or maybe a pc ;)
---
I'm sorry, is this some sort of peasant joke that I'm too rich to understand?
---
Can we list the weapons it looks alike?
---
1. Malfeasance 
---
2. Thorn
---
3. ?
---
Targeting perks don't roll on boots and you can pull stompEES out of your collection with traction...sooo......ooooooooooh.........who lives in a pineapple under the sea? OP OP!
---
hmm ..... if you don‚Äôt have the content yet , it will all be free in fall with the drop of shadowkeep and that would be a good time to hope in, but if you are trying to jump back in ( I did just now) I would buy forsaken and the annual pass then...
---
THIS REQUIRES FORSAKEN
---
if you have it....
---
complete the campeign first.
---
hey man ! I was in a similar boat earlier. I recommend just getting powerful gear drops until you can start the ‚Äúinvitation‚Äù quest. That quest will get you to 690 maybe higher , introduce you to this seasons nee activity the managerie, and than set you up for the raid and really cool managerie weapons , than go do the forges and gambit stuff from last seasons for extra drops and exotics , which at the level you are at should be very easy. 
---
Here‚Äôs a list In case you need it:
---
1. Get to the recomended power to start the invatation quest
---
2. Work on quest 
---
3. Get to 690
---
4. Start manegerie grinding and open barge chests for imperials. ( they unlock chalice upgrades which can increase your drops at the end of managerie, GET POWER AND EFFIENCEY  2 AS FAST AS POSSIBLE!
---
5.get to 720 ish than go back and do the black armory forges for more bounties and stuff from the ada 1 vendor. 
---
6. Try out new gambit modes from the gambit season 
---
Eventually you should get to 750 as long as you keep the grind up 
---
Also recommend going for the crucible quest weapon the ‚Äúrecluse‚Äù its very powerful. 
---
Hope this helped.
---
Yea spend around $400 on a side grade... lol
---
I would purchase forsaken and the annual pass ... than do this 
---
nope. just y1 stuff
---
Yeah, yeah it is lol.
---
...I do...because sometimes it‚Äôs fun to save the day with the bubble...I‚Äôll just go hide now
---
General Kenobi
---
understandable.
---
bro same
---
I mean, unless you are a completionist, suros regime is not all that special. But quest are the best way to get exotics because its guaranteed. So long as its a worth while exotic then it would be worth it
---
The Destiny app is just as useless as this
---
Eh, you make more money over all but the publishers don't care. More money after a years wait verse slightly less instantaneously is better in their eyes.
---
It's like they have the attention span and critical thinking of a 3 y/o...they can only see the now.
---
Suppose to be "fair" to them they have no clue when it comes to games, just looking for cash. Or in the case of the publisher itself just looking to appease the "I want money" guys.
---
Wow. All these months later and I haven‚Äôt gotten either to drop. Fuck my luck lol
---
Thorn was dissapointing because it wasn't worth while at all but Izanagis I have had loads of fun with
---
Nightmare to setup lol..
---
ah gotcha. but don‚Äôt play just bc of exotics! other content is great man
---
Would arise PvP issues sadly
---
Hahaha, Maybe for you. I do 9 raids a week all with a new random group each time. Maybe your attitude is apparent.
---
it‚Äôs kinda like that‚Äôs the point of raids!
---
Oh for real? I must have not noticed then, good to know, thanks.
---
Helm of Saint-14?
---
I think the answer is to tone the other supers down in crucible not buff the ones that are fine.
---
One of my buds that just got into the game and I are about to start grinding out some shit. Wanna join up?
---
honestly, up to you. this new season is great! but the previous 2 (black armory, jokers wild) were not great. shadowkeep will bring great things to the game and will also be a great starting place.
---
No problem :D have a nice reload
---
And yet again titan and it's exotics seem underwhelming in sheer power. Always overclassed. It could use some love.
---
gotcha. moneys hard.
---
I agree the big developers are just greedy businessmen, I think no mans sky was a smaller studio that was probably forced to release due to financial concerns. Could be wrong. I didnt look into it that deeply. But they did make good on adding much much more to their product
---
also a teenager. it‚Äôs fucking hard to pay for this shit. i‚Äôm only 15 so i can‚Äôt drive or get a job or anything. idek how i managed to pay for foresaken.
---
Not so much a completionist more of a I saw someone with it real early on destiny 1 and I‚Äôve always wanted it but have never been able to get it so it haunts every power gear drop I have haha
---
You aint getting that barricade for reloads without us. Keep on talking smack bois, we'll remember when it comes raid time.
---
Yea I‚Äôm down. I started a new character and am working on him now. Didn‚Äôt like the way my first one looked and I wasn‚Äôt far so I made a new one.
---
Then what happens to banner shield.
---
Thanks for the help, Guardians.
---
The one in the vault is accessible. I did it. You have to remember to enter the wish. It's in the vault. NOT the one after morgeth. It's the one IN the vault.
---
next season will have a pass BUT also an option to buy individually. i‚Äôm also talking about people who have the annual pass but refuse to try the new season
---
I feel you man. I‚Äôm interning across the country for the summer and I didn‚Äôt take my Xbox. I‚Äôm 7 weeks in and I miss playing so badly lol.
---
Do titans even have a use? 
---
I‚Äôm saying this as a person who played through the entirety of Destiny 1 as a Titan and Destiny 2 up until recently
---
It‚Äôs easy to find people to do raids with, it‚Äôs useless when you need what I‚Äôm looking for.
---
Im about to end your career 
---
Lunafaction boots
---
I got them all months ago. Thanks.
---
That was actually freaking nuts.
---
Yeah i beat the throne before and got to the next stage of the quest. But i quit playing for a while and now when i look in my inventory the coins that you have to charge up for the bow are not there. I am just going to try and re do the dungeon and maybe ill get them back. I dont know.
---
I throw my healing grenade on my statement
---
man, please dont take this the wrong way, but my grandpa always told me that a man needs to set his priorities straight; when I moved overseas, for a good 7-9 months my house was literally a fridge, a microwave, a small bed, my PS4 and a small monitor I bought the day I arrived. 
---
jokes aside, I wish you the best and hope you start killing on your new job so you can settle down really quick and get back to action with us.
---
Good luck, mate!
---
Yeah graviton lance is a crucible one as well
---
I mean we‚Äôd just self res anyways....
---
I panic slam your statement.
---
Crucible is full of 1 hit melee attacks, supers, snipers, sliding shotguns, ect. I honestly don't see the fun in it, am I missing something? Get gud?
---
But did you do the mission in the tangled shore after beating the throne?
---
Imagine a titan pops a bubble on the bank in gambit when he‚Äôs invading, not only do you have to run in there to kill him, but he can shoot through it to kill you from however far away you are before you can even get inside
---
The Ursas are awful, even before the nerf they were awful, synthoceps are very limited use case, dunes are good though.
---
Not a deflection of your entire comment, just a statement on your listed exotics.
---
Never said it was good in D1, I‚Äôm glad Ward of Dawn is gone lol
---
You sound like the toxic one here dude :/ just sayin
---
Yellow bars = boss spec  
---
Orange bars = Major Spec  
---
Red bars = Minor Spec
---
Love how Fusions in PvP are suddenly a topic when they‚Äôve been the SAME SINCE FORSAKEN LAUNCHED (besides Telesto).
---
That makes no fucking sense.
---
Pretty sure you had to pre order forsaken to be able to pull them from collections
---
With dark drinker possibly coming that would be great
---
what the double fuck
---
Yep
---
Shoulder charge with skull fort I still love in PvE. Well in strikes and mob areas. You don‚Äôt need it, but it‚Äôs super fun at least. Hmmm maybe not very useful actually since it likely rarely turns the tide of battle. It did for me I‚Äôm shattered throne, but that‚Äôs about all I can think of.
---
Go to the red icon in the farm and continue the story then you‚Äôll be able to unlock the planets and continue on
---
Just relax, what happens happens. Also, don't use the same loadout every time, spice things up a bit.
---
Ah I see. Maybe contact support if you still have trouble with the items then. Good luck to you!
---
If this is for pve take off full choke it reduces crit damage
---
Allow us to shoot out of the bubble @Bungie
---
Outbreak perfected, try go for some pinnacles like recluse and wendigo
---
Or just a way to generate extra orbs from blocking damage with the bubble like in D1. That way it could AT LEAST be used in niche situations for orb generation in raids and other end game activities. Similar to how hunters use their bow super for orb generation.
---
Nope,  did someone die after his death?
---
They're fine.
---
That is surprisingly helpful. Im always so tense when i play comp. I know its a competitive mode so im always trying to be on my "A game" and forget to have fun with it.
---
No they‚Äôre not, they‚Äôre awful
---
Left
---
Wendigo gl3 is my personal favorite.. of you wanna grind the quest for it
---
Unfortunately not. If it did i would probably only ever use bubble
---
How long did it take you to finish quest?
---
I understand where you coming from
---
I'm a warlock main and I really want bubble to serve a similar purpose as well. I just don't know how exactly you could do that without making them redundant.
---
I'd love to jump into a raid group without a "REEEE put on well, put on well, put on well! REEEEE" let me cosplay goku with my "fuck you blue beam" or my spirit bomb.
---
Hunter jump by far; it‚Äôs the easiest to use, sexiest, best for correcting mistakes, best for mobility, and can go the highest. 
---
Add in St0mp3es and... dam.
---
hunter jump is better for mobility, warlock is better for moving far, and titan is useless
---
About 7 hours. Took me all day but took breaks. Don‚Äôt wanna burn yourself out lol
---
2 hours ish
---
Do you have  a ps4?
---
Shaxx SMASH
---
yeah well is broken asf but the issue is so many things, raids etc NEED them now so were stuck with them
---
I have xbox one and I realllly want the windigo
---
lol. joker
---
On the destiny app there is a fireteams tab for people looking for groups.
---
I very much agree
---
Or mountain top
---
Man if i knew that it was eventually gonna drop from strikes and stuff i wouldn't have grinded my ass off in the faction rallies lol
---
Even tho titans are op rn
---
Remember when titans did stuff for the team lol
---
I feel like if a post goes ‚Äúmust have/be‚Äù constantly, there‚Äôs a problem
---
Of course right after I post that it‚Äôs working fine for me again too. Guess the put a new hamster on the wheel.
---
It's true
---
Who let this guy drink the dumfuk juice?
---
Kinky.
---
I like Shaxx ~~'s taste~~
---
With no turning back, i can shoot arrows blindfolded and still do precision kills.
---
Literally have no idea what "runninar dou" is supposed to mean I was super fucked up when I made this post
---
For pve only thing I would change is look for archers tempo with a reload masterwork.
---
I play a lot of solo.
---
Expect your glory to rubberband a bunch.
---
And be ok with crying.... like a lot.
---
I can‚Äôt do that
---
Cuz no cares
---
Ooooh ok, even the power level of items?
---
God this brings back horrible memories of running trials with buddies back in the day.
---
TITAN! YOU CAN HAVE UP TO 3 GRENADES (3RD ONE WITH EXOTIC) AND PUNCH PEOPLE WITH HANDS, GUNS, SWORDS, SUPERS AND EVEN WITH THOSE GRENADES! IF YOU ONCE WONDERED *HOW IT WOULD BE TO PUNCH A BOSS TO DEATH?* THEN YOU CAN CHECK THIS OUT YOURSELF! DON'T UNTIL TOMMOROW! BECOME TITANBRO TODAY!
---
I just got back into D2 recently as well (I took a break just before black armory was released). 
---
Don‚Äôt be afraid though man! It‚Äôs f‚Äôn Destiny! I always find that even if I get a bit bored of content (or lack of), I can always jump back in.  Hope you do the same!
---
Destiny fo life lol
---
I'll be re downloading it tonight and start at the grind again there. You got me inspired. If you're on Xbox, my Reddit is my gtag.
---
Me: I swear on the light if you add another fucking taken phanalax bos-
---
 Bungie: the corrupted appears
---
Me: NIüÖ±Ô∏èüÖ±Ô∏èA
---
Never mind I figured it out
---
It‚Äôs was regular size
---
Go to your director( where you hold your ghost out) and go to the left pursuits should be there
---
Spicy ramen. *nice*
---
In the directory, on the far left. I.e, if you start at planet/activity selection, press Lb a few times.
---
lol, excellent enthusiasm
