Wait, what? There is no place to activate wishes in Shattered Throne. The only place to input wishes, and the only place wishes have an effect is Last Wish.

While I can attest that OEM still is a tad bit too strong, I honestly think that’s how it’s gonna turn out. It’ll get nerfed and all the shit players that always complain are gonna flock to reddit and say “ThE OeM nErFs WeReNt EnOuGh CaUsE I GoT KiLLeD By SoMeOnE uSiNg OeM

*titan 
---
Since destiny 1 vanilla
---
What a line!
---
My internet doesn't give them a 150% overshield. Stop playing a fucking noob class troll.
---
Oh no i know, I just felt in PvE i got way more value out of Raiden Flux + Top tree arc
---
I'm gonna assume you never played D1, or you simply had an ultra dumb ass moment.
---
Shit dude this is the best meme I’ve seen all day !!
---
I was just on that vid! 
---
Adding on to this. Instead of its removal can we get a titan figure skating mode. Judged by Hunters and Ew... Warlocks. 
---
Thanks bro. Ily
---
as a warlock, i usually shutdown Spectral blades with Nova Bomb Cataclysm or the Voop Gun (Tractor Cannon). If you got a Super Mod Build, you'll get Nova Bomb in no time and ready for shutdowns.
---
With the buff Acrius is very good now. You’ll want to get that (From Leviathan Raid)
---
I’m pretty sure there was a patch where engrams had a weighted chance of being an Exotic you rarely get ie, one you don’t have
---
Awesome. Thanks for the info!
---
Well we don’t know exactly what the nerf will entail; look at Blade Barrage. We all were calling it a nerf but really it was a rebalance and it’s still just as viable in PvP. An exotic getting nerfed isn’t going to destroy a whole class when they’re actually buffing a lot of the underpowered subclasses. This of course is all from a PvP perspective. 
---
And skating is not getting removed - arguably it will actually be more common now because it will be possible with normal input, making it a skill to learn. It’s just getting adjusted so that it’s design, not an exploit.
---
Basically I don’t think there’s any reason to assume the worst.
---
4 years?
---
Those are the kind of players that immediately assume DDOS when they disconnect. Or suspect hacking, etc.
---
    AFK Opponent
---
    Better pull out my special / heavy weapon to secure the kill.
---
Everytime.
---
Can’t risk it
---
Was hoping for mans1ay3r but that works as well
---
Running Nascent Dawn on my Titan right now, but the 1st step gave me the scout again.
---
OP must be a dirty titan main to post this crap 
---
Dedicated servers would be nice. 
---
I find it fun to kill players vs AI. It’s a diff experience to fight an enemy that thinks rather than runs off script.
---
As far as soloing, it’s naturally gonna be harder as competitive focuses heavily on teamwork, since the teams are smaller. If you want to do well, pick someone on your team. Glue yourself to them. Help cover their angles, teamshot, and rush with them. Basically, play as if you were their only backup. If they die, run away and regroup.
---
Does anyone know, if I visit him on Monday night with a significant higher light level on my character, will the exotic light level of what’s he’s selling increase also? I just went to him not realizing everything would be 435 light since I’m on a new character/account.  :)
---
I'm getting frustrated with solo queue. But I am getting better. Gonna stick at it through sweat and tears lol
---
Have you managed to get Luna's?
---
Who said anything about gay? Always considered calling someone fruity to be akin to calling them flamboyant and ya don't have to be gay to be flamboyant. I compared Orpheus to Dandelion because they are both essentially bards and in modern fantasy bards are often deoicted as flamboyant. And I said it in jest, perhaps "joke" isnt the correct word, maybe I should have said that I said it as a goof, but it seems people often use "joke" and "jokingly" when referred to something they said or did in a non-serious manner.
---
You are seriously coming off as bootybothered though. 
---
Playable Fallen when?
---
I'm not crying... There's something stuck in my eye.
---
Yes, they are fixed roles. 
---
There's an awful lot of people pissed off about the impending nerf, especially considering it was apparently nothing special. Hmm
---
Or they’ll nerf if to the ground and then people will complain about the next best thing.................
---
ALWAYS rewatch. 
---
It gives almost 50% of your health as an overshield.
---
That's a fucking LOT.
---
Lol! What does that exotic even do??
---
I gotta get the osprey, the braytech scout rifle and secrets victories emblem still
---
Thanks! Since I didn’t take the bow this week, looks like I’m waiting for reset.
---
Someone needs to photo shot Micheal Jackson leaning with his thrall back up dancers
---
It would still only take 2 hits from the super to kill someone with 150% hp.  I guarantee, that OEM doesn’t give you that much extra hp.  You can still be one shot with a shotgun, you can still be one shot with a sniper, you can still die to one hit from a super.  Yes it’s extremely powerful, but it’s not that comically exaggerated of an effect. 
---
Unlucky and no worries
---
yeah...i guess he just can't stand the life as a stationary boss and went full beserk on my team
---
Agreed with all bar the mercury armor. I cant imagine how bad it will be cramming a large number of players into a patrol area smaller then titan, without changing the way the infinite forest works
---
Even with the recent buff, it didn't feel right. Literally got it and scrapped it after 20 minutes of playing the other day.
---
Not yet, but I haven’t been trying to much tbh, when I do I’m just gonna LFH for a skilled group 
---
Pretty much the best although some would say the curated roll is better.
---
Idk why but I can hear alien ant farm with this pic
---
As a hunter main I would personally like to disassociate myself with OP.
---
Which mission is this from?
---
"Ps4 iS bEtTer ThAN Xbox" 
---
Sometimes the classics are the way to go.
---
I only use it in PvE, so for me the curated roll is more or less unbeatable. That certainly sounds nice though!
---
Right ? Haha
---
I think my best bet is probably to wait, at least reset isn’t that far out. I got the pulse rifle last week, had a bad roll so I scrapped it. Definitely regretting that decision now though. Bright side, Bungie had the foresight to make rare bounties last enough time to complete!
---
I hadn't played a single comp game in months. Maybe since season 2 or 3. Well, after today I got to 530 Glory and ticked off the 100 hand cannon kills. Nearly broke my controller over it but so far it seems solo-able.
---
[Really now?](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyFashion/comments/acaj6l/3440x1440_warlockchaos_reach_main_here_this_is_my/)
---
A high frame-rate used to do the trick
---
 F 
---
I disagree, I always take a sniper into gambit for the sole purpose of pvp. Get one with high fire rate and you can always 2-3 tap an invader. If nothing else you get them so low a teammate can finish them fast. I play a lot of crucible so my style might be a little skewed for that though
---
Floating warlock dead warlock. My crucible game improved dramatically when I switched to blink jump.

Synthoceps makes Titan melee range way too long, I get shotgunned from stupid distances now!

... The Braytech Osprey doesn't have random rolls. Or does it?
---
Yep. Channels are just clickbait garbage. I wish marcostyle did destiny vids. 
---
106/113
---
Which makes me wonder, why does yours say 101/**115**?
---
tks
---
It does not, braytech always drops as a curated roll. Other NF exclusives can drop either as the masterworked curated roll or with random rolls. 
---
It’s why I stopped watching Houndish, Moreconsole and all them. Only one I watch is Datto for game info cuz he gets a pass, since he’s usually more in depth with stuff. It’s not just filler. 
---
Theres one skin that looks like Vigilance Wing cant remember the name or gun though

This. All of this.
---
i don't kill afk players in pvp anymore unless i can extend my super from them... that's pretty important, you know?
---
I don’t have it, and never will because I don’t play destiny like that anymore. No one is hating on it, just saying that it was the meta at some point, and probably still is. 
---
yep im using this aswell atm
---
same for me, two oems in my vault :)
---
somewhat agree. OEM is pretty strong rn but people are sleeping hard on heart of inmost light. double oneshot lightning grenades are a thing...
---
oh man
---
Ok I've missed a ton of shit
---
Plz gib bad juju
---
I've tried everything. Nothing seems to work. Just did 3 more runs. Still nothing.
---
yep its definetly still meta, but you cant hate a player for using luna when you know what they went through to get it. cant say that for many of the other weapons in this game. it deserves to be on top compared to everything else
---
oh shit watch out the hunters found you and they brought their dislikes
---
You're saying we should be doing quantity over quality? That seems just backwards to me. We're still doing each run in 10 mins or so.

Don’t Nerf it buff other things create some sort of counter play. Nerfing is lazy.
---

---
I used the dawning sleigh once after I got it fully upgraded, realized just how much I use the side to side dodge very quickly.

Been tempted to just leave on an instant summon ghost and try an improved dodge sparrow though.

i cant stand it when he breaks into his american idol singing voice
---
I just got the drink at the well which by default has to give you the secret victories which has issues i have done at least one of each  type and heroic of the third success in each one this is a theory of course
---
drugs might be involved in that part or they are just new players and just got the forge dlc, but cant really understand why you would not get the idea what to do even if its easy like the forge.
---
Nothing in patch notes about being fixed. Bungie also haven't updated their response on my ticket, so I assume it's still bugged. Not willing to risk testing it on my alts. Powerful frames can be purchased from Ada1 and forged in Gofannon, bugged confirmed as only basic sniper frame and basic bow frame (izanami).
---
Your first meatball kill should drop the quest, I might be wrong though. Been awhile since I got malf
---
It first reminded me of the kirk the prickly boi from DS3...
---
Thank you!
---
Here's an idea: mark the bank spot every 5 motes with a marker of different colors going green (smal blocker) yellow (medium) Red (large) that also represent danger of losing the motes
---
Obviously, they're **exo**llent!
---
Yeah. I handed in a bunch of stuff to various NPCs and got them and still nothing. :(
---
Stuck on 2/5 
---
The tyrant shell?
---
The Dragon's Shadow is specifically good for Crucible. If you choose the dodge which fully recharges melee ability near enemies, you can try to do two things at once (reload your weapons and return your melee). 
---
(Sorry for any possible mistakes)
---
This might be an unpopular opinion, but I still like using my Crimson. In PVE at least.
---
Because you touch yourself at night
---
It's once per account, that would be awesome if it was every week. 100k voices will come in time. Some closer than others 
---
vendor engrams/quest rewards don't count. neither does opening engrams in the postmaster. you have to pick up purple engrams in the wild, they automatically decrypt and add progress. same with the exotic if you haven't already completed that part. on that note, catalysts and otherside drops from strikes count towards the quest step
---
And what fucking sucks is that bungie only listens to people like that.
---
You're welcome.
---
With a thick Austrian accent. That part is essential. 
---
Must be that, because i play with 1050ti on my PC and get about 75 fps on Medium settings
---
Ahh OK.. That explains it I guess. 😭
---
Guess I should do more strikes 
---

Yeah that sucks so bad. Im glad there are clans for everyone tho. You just got to find them.

I get that, i enjoy the grind
---
Hey! Why you hating on the blade barrage players? It’s a thing that happens regardless of class..
---
I refuse to drive sparrows that can’t flip. 
---
You get so used to spamming the trigger that you forget you have full auto half the time
---
Feel free to add me Sn0W#21213
---
A special engram that only drops travellers chosen, in not broken form. 0.000000001 drop chance.
---
Well I just hope they don't return Y1 Crimson Days Sparrow. I was the only one in my clan to have that sparrow.
---
The melee titan and hunter supers need the same amount of hits on each other to get the kill, who wins tends to be more about luck than anything else.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Hence I think spectral blades is the best option, because of the insane duration and lungespam with gwinsin vest, on top of having stealth to keep you off the radar.
---
As for shields, I agree they are situationally good, but imo warlock puddles have more overall utility.
---
I still haven’t gotten any Forsaken exotics on my Titan yet. 
---
Except this isn't Anthem! It's a br game called "Apex"!
---
Can confirm. I also have JR masterworked and whenever I see a red light in the distance I instantly crouch and start plinking them. 8 times out of 10 Sniper rounds always whizz pass above mein head. 
---
So I completed it at the Exodus black area, then went down to the Hallow while grumbling angrily and it completed as soon as I zoned in. YMMV.
---
Houndish is kinda annoying but moreconsole is terrible he made a video titles new vendor coming to Destiny only to reveal it's only for the Korean version guardian  
---
Oof. Too accurate. 
---
Kevin the time lord lord of all time
---
Rip bad juju 
---
I was surprised to see exotic engram drop during a mission lol
---
That and aztecross or if you want to feel bad at crucible bakengangsta 
---
Yea it really is amazing
---
Whats is that quest second from the right?
---
At least the bag is literally telling you that you’re going to keep getting the same five exotics. 
---
I like Aztecross and True Vanguard, even though I'm not a PvP guy, their videos are fun to watch and they are pleasant personalities. I'll sometimes watch Coolguy if one of his videos pops up in my feed.
---
Datto... I dunno man. He just always sounds negative and condescending to me. His videos have good information, but I've backed out of a few halfway through because I got tired of his whining. Sometimes he's all right though. 
---
That’s how I feel about MoreConsole tbh. 
---
Love TV, but I do feel like he sometimes forgets not everyone is as good as he his. 
---
Front flip for style is NOT useless.
---
It's for style.

---
I got my first exotic engram in a few months yesterday. It was my 3rd Borealis in one month (one from fated engram, one from milestones, one from this). Its not a bad gun, but there is so much stuff I would rather have
---
How dare they steel our punching culture!
---
Harbinger's Echo from the dreaming city does this btw.
---
Oh sad  
---
Thanks! May I ask what power level? Just curious
---
This guy's voice grates more than any other YouTuber. 
---
Yeah...but sadly that is a titan thing
---
most exotics just don't do enough to warrant the slot and unless bungie decides to allow unlimited exotics, will never leave the vault. only exotics i use are ace of spades for mah man cayde, the trace rifles for pve, telesto for gambit and sleeper/the prospector for heavy hitters.
---
I just want to have a 6 stack with everyone using The Rat King. I feel like it would be chaos.
---
I wasnt gunna take any chances
---
You're just a hunter bitching about how it's not year one anymore
---
Yep, as long as you have it at the level you want it.
---
Thank you 
---
You might get a year 1 exotic but the rng is very low.
---
Gold.
---
It never happened again. I had about 4 or 5 buffs on me that time. The drops were duplicates.
---
I second the Cerberus.  My first exotic and I thought it was terrible, I was wrong.
---
If you still need an auto rifle by the next time Savathun's Song comes around as a nightfall, you should farm it to try to get Duty Bound. Tigerspite can be good if you get the right combination of perks, and it seems to drop more frequently than other Dreaming City weapons. I've heard this is because you are equally likely to get a Dreaming City weapon for any of the three slots, and Tigerspite is the only primary. 
---
Didn't see which sub... Wanted to shoot the cams...

I do this when my friends pet their chickens in front of me. Only emote I missed out on.

Derfter

but when it *does* hit, its alllllll worth the pain lol
---
Have you done nightfalls? All exotic weapon quests available to you? Shattered Throne (only available every 3 weeks, contains an exotic bow quest). Do you like achievement hunting?
---
It requires finding other players, but have you tried raiding? There are a variety of LFG (looking for group) options, some platform specific, some not, where you can find people to raid with. 
---
Ahh thanks! By curiosity, where do you grab the quest? 
---
The lack of split screen these days annoys me. This is pretty much the only solution.

Looks like a 14 yr old buy trying on his dads armor. My statement stands

There are two weekly bounties she gives out. One is doing 2 forge runs and another is 7 daily bounties.

Mostly Breakneck, Coldheart and Thunderlord. Breakneck is, of course, great for clearing trash. Coldheart is awesome for melting the tough guys. And Thunderlord is just awesome for everything.

Ehroar seems like he thinks he’s better than you. He had a video in the middle of Y1 where he pretty much said that people who prefer Better Devils over Midnight Coup are bad at the game, full stop. Really great way to alienate your potential audience, guy.

Not saying he isn’t a talented guy, but it seems like he would jerk off to a picture of himself.

I recently made a new Warlock (am a Hunter) and I gotta say, the void super felt like a downgrade compared to the solar one.

Yes! I am glad I am not the only one. This last Christmas we purchased another PlayStation so we can do this same thing together. Some of the most fun I’ve had playing destiny.

I mean he's also just an asshole and can't back it up, he is by far one of the worst out of Redeem and he received no backlash for all the shit he did during the Indica incidence

as a company not having split screen is brilliant. it makes people buy 2 consoles and 2 games and 2 DLCs doubling their income.

This also looks like the carbine from Titanfall 2. What game is this?

Only true Voidwalkers won’t really care about the patch and endlessly destroy scrubs

If anything, he should have been kicked out in place of Indica for exacerbating the incident so much. Indica handled it poorly, yes, but didn’t actually do anything wrong

Friend of mine did the same thing for D1. Got two 65” TVs, own couches for each. Like a dream

Not if you have rampage or kill clip. Mine has rampage, and I can body shot spam consistently on x3 rampage. I also never loose my stack because I have rampage spec.

Honestly I’m getting sick and tired of being sick and tired of everything getting nerfed. Just let us have fun. Exotics are supposed to feel strong. I’m mainly a pve player. And it really irks me when people call for PVE nerfs. Like for what reason!? Now I do play pvp from time to time but I do not play comp much and I am not a top tier pvp player. Occasionally I dabble into it but that’s about it. Just because little Johnny gets killed my something in pvp and complains about it sometimes creates this whole bandwagon nerf train. Get over it and move on. Especially when a streamer complains it makes the whole nerf train even more bonkers.  I’m a hunter main and my Titan doesn’t even have OEM. But for the love of God if this thing gets nerfed Titans will be almost useless in pvp. It’s one of the only thing titans got going for them in pvp. And this is the problem with pvp being a part of a game like destiny. It ruins all the fun things. The game starts to feel not as fun when all we get to experience is constant nerfs. Something needs to be done because pvp players (just some not all by any means) are literally driving the “fun” capacity into the ground. They’re ruining it for everyone. Keep nerfs separate from pve, keep exotics out of pvp, keep heavy out of pvp.. just do SOMETHING that doesn’t ruin it for the majority of the player base. I’ve never been a part of a community where the minority (pvp players) whines so much to the point that it affects the experience of the larger portion of players. I honestly wouldn’t care if pvp was completely removed from the game. So there’s my 10000 word rant and hope nobody gets too butthurt over my opinion. Stay safe guardians.

i remember when i was trying to level my hunter it stopped me at 20 or 30 and then i had to buy the spark. If i try leveling another character will it also get stopped at 20/30 or continue until 50? 
---
They are once per class. If you already claimed the campaign end eververse items on that character, it would be why this new one does not have that option.
---
Threat Level in Kinetic, Curated Nation of Beasts in Energy, Thunderlord in power slot.

If I'm cocky I'll try to get 10 but most of the time it's 5 - bank, 5 - bank plus the occasional lucky 8 motes by running through killed mobs

One guy I find interesting, but can’t stand some of his recurring lines, is deicyde. His topics are nice but his Batman/action movie preview voice straining is distracting at times. Good content though.

Wanted to comment the same thing. Back in the Halo 2 LAN party days my dad would go to big extremes so that all my friends could come over and play. I'm talking like having 6 TV's and boxes hooked up. He would also sneak us in a case of monsters sometimes lol. He didn't  have to do that  but he knew it was a great way for him to bond with me. I still look back on that and it makes me happy. You're son will remember this forever. Enjoy the time spent together.  
---
You alright OP? 
---
This is identical to my girlfriend and my set-up.  Good on you!
---
Can't wait to get OEM just in time for the need (I have every other Titan exotic) 
---
explain how its terrible? are you trying to use it at ace ranges? or are you just bad with it?
---
The only time I get the cocky, is when the bounty asks for 1nof each size blocker. When I'm stuck with a greedy team, I'll bank 2 then deal with the bbn lockers everyone else ignores.
---
I think sooooooo?
---
Compared to an exotic which is a million times easier to achieve then Luna’s.... yes it’s bad 
---
I have one just like that you can find them at ikea 
---
Well, I’m a fan of Heavy Machine Guns because they’re great for ad clear and do great damage to bosses, but seeing as you don’t have the annual pass, you can’t get the Hammerhead either. If you haven’t gotten the Whisper of the Worm, that’s certainly one to get and if you haven’t gotten the sleeper simulant that’s a super solid choice as well. I’d start with sleeper IMO.
---
It has the range of a shotgun 
---
Are you?
---
I’ve never been to an IKEA but I always hear good things lol. Maybe have to make a trip 
---
so a gun is bad because you are using it wrong? is TLW also "terrible" then, because it cant compete with pulses?

The cat shell that does jack all until Faction Rally's return? I get why people like it, but it has the worst perks I've ever seen on an exotic ghost.  Faction rallies have been missing for the better part of a year now, and we don't know when they're coming back. Use literally anything else.
---
Alright so I should prioritize getting my hands on Sleeper Simulant and later on maybe Whisper of the Worm? 
---
Thanks a lot.
---
Solar is fun with the hammer smash spin. Also you can throw your hammer and then pick it up again once you level it 
---
Sucks that you can’t play solo though, I downloaded it and was super excited, only to uninstall it cause I don’t want to have to talk to/team up with people just to play
---
Come at me, my Legolas brother.
---
Oh then let’s compare it to hand cannons at equal range. It’s still bad 
---
Iron to Steel
---
I would put a different shader on that fine sparrow tho!
---
How did you get Fighting Lion? Through the engram you can buy?
---
A couple more years and I'll be doing this with my son. 
---
Ew.. lol
---
A friendship has been detected. 
---
ABORT ABORT.
---
Yes, the items he sells will be 20 light below your max light level. 
---
I just got my warlock to level 50 yesterday, and I bought the Sunbracers on my 650 light hunter. Pairing that with a triple stack of 650 weapons, I got my warlock to 638 in a matter of hours.

Titans almost have bo means to heal themselves. OEM helps overcome this issue with an actually efficient titan exotic perk for healing compared to crest of alpha lupi which only give a small chunk. Eventhough I hate playing against OEM I think that we all have to understand that calling something “too op in crucible” will have negative effects on the PvE side, just like wormhusk. Used to be great for PvE now it is nothing. TLDR: Seems that too many people are on the nerf train that reduces the efficiency of an item drasticly for the sole purpose of making crucible easier to play. This in return causes hardships for PvE. 
---
Yeah, the Sleeper will actually be fairly useful for going for the Whisper of the Worm so that’s a plus. The sleeper hits bosses hard, which is what I’ve always used my heavy weapon for so it’ll certainly be a solid weapon for your power slot.
---
The current meta isn’t super kind to exotics outside of the power slot when looking at pure damage / DPS.
---
Damn. If you’re on psn my name is quzrealodz. I feel like i could pop out a couple games if you want.
---
Yea that’s my view on it. Plus I’ve gotten put with some super toxic dudes a few times, which sucked. I would love a solo / 1 man army type queue, but I’m hoping for it 
---
Totally agree. 
---
 xbox sadly
---
worst part is most of my comp friends switched psn as well :(
---
That's a Necron tho
---
It is the Arms Dealer
---
PCs are on the other side of the room! Prefer playing D2 sat on a sofa though.
---
they kept killing me and one went the long road to start teabagging me; i was getting bullied bro
---
What a Legend You Did It For Cayde
---
If you have a plan that slows you down after a certain limit, it works sometimes
---
when ive gone over the limit, I'm slowed to 512kb/s and I dont get any connection issues. Some lag, but with destinys servers, thats just how it is
---
Yeah tou want three people for that. If you’re on psn i could help. ~ quzrealodz
---
teabags are definitely uncalled for in this situation. very rude. 
---
Xbox but thanks
---
Oof
---
You could still do that with the PC pretty easily but hey! I am not gonna force you to change your comfort zone.
---
Yeah, but I cant play on PC without M&amp;KB
---
No only if you got it last year. Otherwise you have to wait till the next solstice
---
Ringing nail is not bad aside from it being in the wrong slot. Particularly cause it can roll rolls no other auto can. LM... is great... with oathkeepers but is otherwise no better then another bow dragonfly with dragonfly mod. The effect is good just really fucking stupid how it just doesnt work on every shot regardless of how long you hold the draw 
---
Hey sorry but could you actually help me? A guy I had never got past the platforming and we fought as a 2 man the whole time.
---
Install a sheet in the middle for when you play crucible. You have been warned.
---
It's about 300-400MB an hour.
---
so AWESOME!!!
---
Of course. Shoot me a friend request and when I’m home I’ll hop on! 
---
Hello friend! Just wanted to add my 2 cents as someone with terrible home internet. I use my hotspot all the time for PvP and it works great. I'm on an unlimited plan so don't really pay attention to how much it uses. I looked up another thread and the consensus there was to make sure you have all the auto updates turned off on your system. The gaming itself doesn't use much (about 80mb per hour) so just check your data here and there to avoid overages if you aren't on an unlimited plan. Hope this helps. Cheers! 
---
# wow
---
Congrats!
---
Then you'd like games like insurgency, siege or mechwarrior way better since your case is more exception then norm
---
Its pretty shit nowadays
---
You're son is so lucky to have a bond like this with his father. My dad has a rap sheet a mile long and I've always wanted something like this with him but he's just too unstable/volatile. Last time I saw him he was being escorted by the police at my grandmother's funeral.
---
Just need the bloody rocket launcher. 
---
Sigh. Looping st over and over gets so borrrring. 
---
Cutting ties with a crazy ex, the true end game

---
Check your tires, mate. 
---
Would love that back in. Just tweak it’s perk to give ammo back on explosion kills tho 
---
My boyfriend and I have two TVs set up in the living room so we can play together. One is smaller so it can be put away when not playing. Not as cool looking as your setup though! Love it!
---
I wouldn't use MC in PVP as range is its worst stat. In PVE I still think it's great--might get beaten out by a god roll Duke, but the feel on the gun beyond makes up for it. My favorite gun the game FYI.
---
This story reminds me of the Terry Crews hot ones. He talks about building a computer with his son and like how he embraced what his son is in to so that they can bond better. Made me super happy 
---
Bawls.
---
I don’t have issues with your supers at all. Titans get no hp regen unless they get a kill, and our main stat is obsolete in PvP. If theyre gonna nerf the OEM titans need more mobility or survival utility. Hunters can get up in your face and spam triple jump and dodge and warlocks can teleport and heal whenever they want. Its sad to see my favorite class just be blatantly at a disadvantage without OEM. Give me a blink ability or triple jump/dodge and we can call it even when they nerf OEM. 
---
I see what you did there. You’re either calculating 2 full pizzas per person and/or you’re calling bungie fatasses. Bravo either way. And bravo to pizza drivers. Now you can make alt accounts
---
I used to play Diablo 2 on PC with my late father on a side by side setup just like this. Those are honestly some of the best memories I have with my dad. Your son will be so happy to have these memories in the future. Good job dad.
---
Only time my clan plays is when shattered throne is available 
---
Awesome. Me and my son use a pair of monitors these days but same idea. He just got his last word. Being able to buy once and play on 2 consoles simultaneously has really helped with costs. 
---
From the amount of hunter I have played, it is more wanting to use you melee ABILITY (like throwing knifes or smoke bombs) but the game saying "nope, you actually wanted to stab that thrall" and lunges you literally miles so you can melee the thrall and get murdered by the rest of the thralls following it
---
I mean, you have TWO weapon slots, put a short range weapon in one and a mid to long range one in the other. If youre sitting there with a pulse rifle trying to kill someone rushing w a shotgun thats on you for dying. You can put a shotgun in that second slot and switch to it for close quarters, or if you dont want to do thay you can use a sidearm, or a last word. This isnt call of duty where you can sit and camp w one weapon all game, especially not in comp.
---
Could use a third for destiny a lot. Me and my brother play. Pm me your gt. We get triggered at pvp bs too.
---
This is exactly what my wife and I do. It's awesome!

I'm 22 but a father myself. I'd be happy to group up with a respectable guy such as yourself.
---
I have destiny 2 on PC and PS4 but the only one viable character on PS4 currently. I'm working 12 hours a day mon-fri so it's been hard for me to level up. I was a Sherpa in d1 for the first two raids and would be ecstatic to help your either of you level up. If you're on Xbox 1 I'm positive I could convince my brother in-law to do the same but I think he's a bit behind myself but not by much.
---
Sorry for the long comment; I just really appreciate wholesome people like yourself, and recently it seems that the community is made up of less and less people like you.
