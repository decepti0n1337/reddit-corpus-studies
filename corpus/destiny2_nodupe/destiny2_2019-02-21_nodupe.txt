Shit, I looked up malfeasance online, and that brought me to look up The Last Word, and now I have another Hand Cannon need that will force me to do way too much PvP.

---
---
Agreed , I honestly don’t understand why they implemented the throne the way they did . Hell even if it had been a once a day thing . I would do it every day . The fact that after three runs , I basically have to accept that I can’t try again for another 3 weeks is what kills me .
---
Looks like you gave em hell, Guardian! 
---
what chest armor is that?
---
Exactly. Its a game centered around a grind, but you arent allowed to grind 
---
yeah but starting a game at 5v3 is a bit much isn't it? it was so 1 sided it was hilarious, more guardians only got added when the score was 55 to 23. lost cause by then
---
Let me get this straight, when you were killed by a servitor, it was when you were with 650 level players? 
---

---
The strikes/nightfalls players are able to launch depend on their own levels. So for example, base game players can only launch nightfalls where the enemies are all power level 270. Meanwhile, players with Forsaken can only launch nightfalls where all enemies are power level 540. I don't know the exact number for strikes, unfortunately. 
---
that is my question 
---
No
---
Doesn't the whisper dungeon take place in one of the lost sectors which in turn leads further underground until your under the Pyramidion?
---
No. The servitor kill me, and it's recommended level was 622, while I was with the sub-20 players. 
---
I'm pretty sure it was a straight up strike.
---
Idk, but someone went out of the map and saw that it’s actually right where he’s looking. It makes sense if u read the Xol lore
---
This picture is really old
---
I'm still on like 6/25 headshots with a HC lol
---
I have been away from the game for a long time, about the Last Wish Raid... Whats the name of the armor pieces you are wearing? I did see the Helmet is from the Wing Contender set. Can't find or not seeing anything else.
---
I’ve had this happen for an hour consecutively.  Either spawn in at end with six seconds left or spawn in solo then two others get added when I’m wiping out with six seconds to go. PS4. 
---
Yeah why tf is borealis in the heavy slot is this from y1
---
Most likely a very old repost, or they took this, and then forgot about it
---
Rampage and Kill Clip together is an okay roll...Rampage/Kill Clip and Outlaw is a God roll. Kill clip doesn't give as large of bonus but lasts slightly longer, while rampage with all 3 stacks gives more damage but doesn't last as long. Outlaw helps keep the damage bonus up even through reloads.
---
I pulled a sneaky on ya
---
Sagira is looking pretty fine right now
---
Yoooo, this happened to me for the first time the other night.  I lost my shit. XD
---
Yup! Disorients everyone while your shielded target is debuffed against kinetic damage (disruption break)
---
No sniper has that description.   
---
Still, their shots penetrate targets, especially in crucible.  
---
I also play at night, NA CST
---
Gotta get some friends and do it together. Take turns on one person picking them all up
---
the problem with that quest is more than personal difference; it literally forces you to play longer if you're worse, and if you have 0.3 K/D like me, you're as good as fucked
---
Shadow Lake is on EDZ. It's the base strike of the nightfall you farm Militia's Birthright on
---
Wow that must’ve hurt. And yeah, you’d think that a person infused with the power of the traveler would be able to withstand something as small as that. 
---
I'm sure every hunter with Shards did.
---
Pick a weapon and stick with it.  Dont swap out of frustration.  Follow the group.
---
I feel like the kills weren’t even that hard, what took some time for me was avenge/revenge kills just because I didn’t just suicide and find the guy who killed me or I didn’t camp my mates enough. Anyway it was all pretty easy imo.
---
Code of the Juggernaut Super with Eternal Warrior is great for getting Army of One medals.
---
You'll have to pay for a whole new DLC.
---
Radiolarian culture: Use a ghost shell that highlights chests on a planet. Do public events on that planet while opening chests.
---
Paradox amplifiers: There are three total ways to get this. Strikes, crucible matches, and heroic adventures on Mercury. 
---
You don't have to do this all at once. If it gets repetitive, do something else for a while. 
---
MOM GET THE CAMERA!!!
---
I hear you man. I just got the sparrow finally last Saturday on my 53rd clear (about 40 looted clears). Just gotta keep pushing and pray to rngesus lol. But thank you for the grats on Blacksmith and grats on yours too! That ship grind was rough. 
---
Thanks man!
---
That's exactly what I did. The day after it dropped I already had the gun and received hate mail from some player. Mayhem made that quest so easy. 
---
Nope still catching L’s like I’m getting paid for it.
---
Maybe have it so where comp is 4 v 4 elimination best 2/3 like Gambit and you can’t use the same loadout twice in a game. So first game let’s say I use Blade Barrage with Ace and Mindbenders ambition so next game I have to switch exotic guns and subclass 
---
But your shit is shit. Love you though
---
Ikora gave me the queenbreaker this week. I will never shit talk her ever again 
---
&lt;s&gt;
---
Now go get some sun!
---
&lt;/s&gt;
---
Actually that's rad. I've yet to try the Scourge raid so I'm only wayfarer yet.  Grindin!
---
This thing is trash though lmao. Good post 
---
Why on Earth haven't they buffed that thing yet.
---
I've soloed it but I can't bring myself to try for flawless. I got the emblem and I'm happy. Would like to never enter The Shattered Throne again.
---
This makes me deeply saddened and very uncomfortable. It’s like a Celestial Nighthawk that deals more damage, recovers more super, has AOE damage, and doesn’t have to aim.
---
No worries! Glad you like it
---
Do you have cookies?
---
Yeah, you can replay it all week on the same character. Just like a raid though, you will only get encounter drops upon first completion. 
---
Note: there is no way to reset a checkpoint solo. If you want to start fresh from a checkpoint, you'll have to join someone else's fresh run. 
---
Not my fault it’s trash lol
---
I really liked how they developed Ikora, and it’s super annoying that they essentially gutted her by removing any need for interaction now. She may as well not be in the game for as useful as she is atm. Hopefully vendors will get some love at some point and make them feel more “real”
---
Anthem is absolutely trash, it's not fun it's just monotonous and way more painful to play than other games are, so far all the reviews have been just saying the same thing; there's no end game content, there's no point in playing after you've beaten the story (which isn't that good either plus they roadblock story progression with those dumb collectable missions to access tombs).
---
I'm honestly ashamed of BioWare because they've made so many amazing games in the past and now they churn out this crap?
---
Retold Tales range is pretty nuts. Probably wouldnt have been able to one shot him if it wasn't a headhsot
---
Am hunter, can agree
---
I used Tether and Colony
---
r/destinycirclejerk
---
i see thanks for the answer
---
thanks
---
This is One Eyed Deception!
---
I just started playing again this week. Are all raids soloable? I remember having to always get a group together for the Calus raid. 
---
Im level 50. Been playing for three days. Anual pass is on sale on psn right now. Buddy carried me fom 30 to 50 in one night. Im still confused but Im trying.
---
No you're not.
---
Isn’t that how supers are supposed to be, you know Super? 
---
Cool
---
Then try playing something else.
---
Every time I see this meme it loses more and more quality. So upvote for not being a repost in a way....
---
Does she drop anything other than tangled web bonds?
---
No it’s as fast without pulse rifle arm (in my opinion) it would be milliseconds difference. Feeding Frenzy is OP period. Feeding Frenzy is in outlaw is out.
---
Thank you 
---
It's working for me
---
Looks like Mechwarrior Online 
---
I mean... She was oblivious to the black armory right under her nose, ran away during the red war, we're kinda overqualified to be caring what she thinks lol. 
---
Ahh I do miss felwinters keep
---
what armour are you rocking on the titan? looks dope
---
*cries in mystic*
---
I ain't cosigning on this 
---
Hunter melee better than titan melee ? I main a hunter and I don't feel like the hunter melee abilities are superior, sure we can throw knives of all kind with cool smoke 'nades, but nothing particularly Op
---
Add a worldline zero into it and you achieve the status of god. 
---
Works for me.
---
Malfeasence and the chaperone
---
I've killed approximately 6 titans in their way to Thundercrash me. :)
---
As an avid collector of beautiful things; Count me in!
---
The emblem goes so damn well with the sheen of oil effect from leviathans prestige shader btw!
---
My issue is with the fossilized Hermaoin Blossoms.
---
I've been told they come from nightfalls, but I've run 10 and can't seem to get any
---
Does 1kv do enough damage? I personally used show of forc/subtle calamity/whisper for it and midnight coup/ikelos/whisper for incaru.
---
Also for my flawless i ran warlock well of radiance for vorgeth and incaru and had taken armaments, taken resistance, taken envigoration and taken repurposing on my gear.
---
And the good thing is you can take all the time you need on the bosses. Don't play risky and keep your distance. Know the safe spots and whatever you do don't rush it. I took like 10 minutes to weaken the wizards and claer out all the ads before starting the damage phase on vorgeth and i took 3 damage phases on incaru.
---
But with nightstalker i expect you to need multiple damage phases on the bosses anyway since you can't just plant a well and not care anymore about their dps. But invis probably gives you massive survivability aswell
---
I agree 100%. I know what to do yet am not quite skilled enough to get the job done.
---
You can, but only 1 encrypted key and 7 fragments
---
Now this is worth showing off! Mad respect dude. Love the themes too! :) 
---
9 because it’s my lucky number.
---
Thanks for doing this. 
---
If you dont get them before the season ends you will have to do all 5 again next season.
---
It's a pack for someone from the US that doesn't want to say American
---
Feel free to, I believe this sub allows for custom flair
---
Old joke but still the best
---
I personally think banner should be locked until level 50. But I understand why bungie didn’t do this. People wouldn’t complain they couldn’t access it. But anything now below 630 in banner your going to have a bad time
---
Unfortunately not, but I’d love it if I could. 
---
Got this one last week, discarded.
---
Just finished all bounties on hunter, already done with titan/warlock.
---
Still missing one reset for redrix however. :/
---
Never see that on console... just a bunch of nova warps and blade barrages that can't be suppressed like other supers and proceed to tbag because they think they're good lol. Litteraly made me quit the game after I got my luna's howl solo.  
---
The title says “my opinion” you’re telling me that my opinion is justified but also wrong. That’s literally what an opinion is 
---
In 6v6 i find myself surrounded a lot, i play 4v4 and its a lot more bearable and gives me time to think about my next move, i would still like your idea of having more open sights, but imagine a future where long range maps exist ?
---
We dont have to imagine... equinox exists.
---
It ends on 22. of February
---
Imma somewhere between black and blue berry
---
I have a friend who is a complete raspberry.
---
And a bounch who are blue/straw berries 
---
Smart, smart indeed
---
That is so cool :-O
---
Ah a principled man with moral values
---
Guacamole
---
I will do that ;] i'm still learning about what are goood roles on armor and stuff and getting up my catalyst 
---
The vanguard dare armour doesn’t all match Caydes I don’t think.
---
But this is someone trying to match the ace of spades, not cayde himself 
---
I’ll trade you my first born for that dust rock blues
---
r/fireteams might help
---
Lol if only trading was a thing
---
[removed]
---
I liked 4v4 but apparently it’s “too slow” for most. 
---
S’ok I don’t have a child to even give away :D
---
Lower tier mobs like dregs normally are one shot, the added kill clip + 3x rampage helped with taking down everything else a little more quicker. 
---
I always imagine my Hunter glaring into the vendor's eyes as he tears their shitty reward to shreds right in front of them
---
Yes.
---
Does it still have benefit after the next pass goes for sale? Like, whatever the annual pass gives, is it always accessible, or do you have to hurry to get everything before the next one?
---
Well you should promote your Clan!
---
Getting nice, friendly, helpful and active people is a rarity, but playing only as three is kinda sad (if you want to raid).
---
My Clan i am in was promoted to be active, now everyone is burnt out of destiny 2 and they have nothing to do. Having essentially 25/40 Members just compeletly leaving the game.
---
That's perfectly ok. What's not ok is the complete lack of perspective going on in the community right now. 
---
They all have to kill 1 person all you gotta do is kill two of them every time you die which is easier said than done if they are organized 
---
º
---
Dam that suxs!  They're Probably going to anthem , apex  and waiting on the division 2 !
---
Carry me to lunas thanks lmao
---
Are you looking for a clan? I’m the founder of a large endgame clan named Get Glimmer and we raid daily and also offer teaching raids throughout the week. 
---
If your still having trouble, add darkace2006 and I'll help ya out. Gambit is one of my fav things to do
---
Yeah he has a point. But my OPINION is that destiny 2 is so built up now and I'm having so much fun with it I'm not going spend my money on a game that the only thing it's proven so far is that it's basic. Just my opinion though, I don't mean to hurt any feeling or offend. 
---
All I can say is just keep grinding man. I got the sparrow (the last cosmetic I needed) on my 53rd LW clear (about 40 looted clears). It’ll drop eventually! Don’t stop believin’
---
Currently I'm in a raid clan, but alot of them don't have the annual pass so we can't do scourge. Perhaps you could add me on bnet? 
---
Nope. A few went back to Destiny 1
---
But you're probably right. I'll stay there AS long AS i have people to join there.
---
Ah. I forgot to mention that we are on PS4 lol. 
---
Fuck you and your luck :(
---
Credit card intensifies
---
Oh no worries. I can try to learn some encounters then maybe I'll find a group
---
I think ive done it like 20 times total xD
---
Keyword PC
---
F
---
But you bought Forsaken so....
---
i you’re having trouble, don’t keep throwing yourself at it and lowering your percentage. take a break and come back to it later
---
Tfw its not actually as strong only op because of Sg skating apes
---
That's awesome
---
Like zoinks scoob I gotta use ultra instinct
---
You're exactly right, you just made my point my man. Because forsaken looked great and revolutionary from release. Anthem has yet to show any sort of excitement and until comes out with a game that has better qualities than destiny and Forsaken, I won't buy it.  I hope it does, it has potential, how It sits right now though, it's basic and I'll just keep playing destiny.
---
least you have checkpoint
---
*screams of agony in Petra's Run*
---
Don't mind me, came here again to laugh at QB in the crucible and people boasting about ULT kills :\_D
---
the Ghost shell, too
---
What’s that supposed to mean? It’s not like I just say that kind of thing on a daily basis, that was part of the joke.
---
Ooookay?
---
Persuade, very high base handling and reload speed. If you get explosive rounds and snapshot you're good to go.
---
your victims would be the ones complaining. that's how PvP works
---
The lost sector under devrim's church gave me my aachen
---
The easiest boss, the most annoying waves. People do Bergusia due to unique drops (such as Jotunn or Matrix) and the fact that ALL frames can be done there.  
---
Basically, everything that can be done or dropped in the other forges can be done or dropped in Bergusia, hence the highest number of clears.
---
at least melting's useful
---
Ah got ya. Thanks for repl. 
---
You literally didn't know what a streak message was. Calm yourself
---
Powerful gear? LOL what powerful gear? There's barely any true  powerful gear in Destiny 2.
---
Anything with hard light...fucking love hard light now!&lt;
---
Tomorrow is my turn to post this.
---
Get that weak shot outta here, Ikora 
---
Anthem isn't actually released yet. It was a EARLY ACCESS week. All the bugs have been fixed in a day 1 patch
---
But this is a Pyramid Head...
---
Thanks for the quick answer, i'll gonna focus on gambit for now and do it as you say, wait for next season to start pvp.
---
There isn't a quest to unlock it.  It's already there.  I am fairly certain you can just go do it if you're 650.  I did the previous forges first, but there was not a quest to unlock bergusia. 
---
I had a semi similar bug happen to me only very different.
---
I invaded my time pasted and I returned with 2 kills, 5 seconds later I was killed... Not by an invader but by an enemy player as if I was still in their world. I was beyond confused. I still not fully sure what happened I wish I had recorded it.
---
Ya I’m gonna have to agree
---
This is making me hate playing the gambit now. Get your own fooking motes dudes.
---
You will have a way to obtain some more each day when you reach a certain point in forsaken. And the more you dismantle purple gear the more you will get later on. I've never ran out of them but I've also never done anything crazy with 'm.
---
Sleeper simulant and loaded question both come from quests, so you do not need to wait for random drops to get them. 
---
Borealis only does super high damage if it is used to break a shield, so it is not overwhelmingly effective in the forges. 
---
Yes to both questions. 
---
Shuro chi encounter in the last wish 
---
It really depends if the opposite team is worse than me
---
The PC port is absolutely terrible
---
Warlock Master race!!
---
if you really sweat it out you could prob do it at 611 or 616
---
That's also anthem players who say it's so much better than destiny...
---
I'm not sure, but I was bummed I missed the Ace offering because I waited until the last minute. However, since these replicas are 1:4 scale, they're pretty small. You'd probably be happier spending some more cash on a replica via etsy or another online shop that offers replicas.
---
you aren't the only one. I wonder if he talks with the same weird syllable spacing in real life. 
---
I wouuld liiiike to ... order...  a large FRY, and a ... cheese ... burger.... for RIIICK   KAAAAHKIS.
---
God that's even painful to type. 
---
Wow this thing is OP. Nerf please
---
I wouldn’t exactly say Kakis is the worst.  Yeh he makes a bunch of filler videos, but you can’t knock his Raid guides.  Not many people get them out as fast, and has been doing them since way back in D1
---
Nah you cant compare it to the start. You can only compare it to now, it’s not 2016, bioware should have learned from the mistakes the destiny franchise made, they have no excuse to make them again
---
Ah. Well I wouldn't mind teaching you! It's easy. And we have a very active and fun server. 
---
That image has seen at least 35 reposts. So much jpeg.
---
Nah you can play it without buying if you have Origin Access. Free 10 hours with Origin Basic &amp; free as long as you want with Origin Premier. Of course not really free, you’re paying for Origin, but the deal is you get access to a bunch of games for free, not just Anthem
---
Is this worth having? I got dredgen, wayfarer, and almost cursebreaker before i stopped playing (when black armory came out), and was wondering how good the quality is, since in particular i was wanting the wayfarer one
---
Hmmmm alright I’m down. PSN is jingle9001 time zone is EST Michigan and at work right now so if you wanted to do it now I’m sorry about that
---
What?
---
I'm looking for tips though. Not a group
---
I’d just buy a 1-to-1 scale replica on etsy for about the same price. Just my thought though. 
---
Heilige scheiße, you did 33 of these and never once got a FF/Rampage?
---
You nailed it. It's the combat loop that makes Destiny, and Halo before it, so good, and what makes anthem feel a little sterile. There are a lot of things that anthem can fix, but without a satisfying combat loop, it's not going to hold people through the times when content is either bad or stale. 
---
I'll start listening to Kackis when it doesn't take him ten minutes to get past the intro in his videos. 
---
Sounds like you gotta get good bro.
---
Wow, good to know! Didn't realize they were upping the size, thanks!
---
Fuck you
---
Where did you find all of them
---
You just never quit, do you?
---
Good for you lucky ass
---
What point are you trying to prove?
---
;) can you explain how to jump the servitor on the sparrow run or post a video link? I’ve tried searching but can’t find much.
---
Oof. You just gotta keep on grindin'. It took me 2 months to get my last Braytech weapon to drop for Wayfarer. I still don't have the Starlight Shell for Cursebreaker either.
---
First, I wasn't saying there's something wrong with repetition. I was stating that acting like Destiny is some idealistic epiphany that's defied the bounds of repetition is objectively false. The criticism that Anthem is repetitive applies as much to the example of 'how it should be' that people are using, as it does the thing being criticized. It's rose-tinted nonsense.   
---
 
---
You say that Destiny has variety in enemies, but the variety almost entirely amounts to "its weak point is in a different spot". I'm not unexperienced with the game, my Hunter is at power 640. You also say Destiny has 'more outside that 30 seconds', but it didn't at the start. At the start it was basically just grinding world events over and over and over. Destiny 2 is **four** DLC into its lifespan, Anthem is barely even released.  
---
The rest of your comment is subjective. I could just as easily state that I find the weapons and environments in Anthem impactful and the weapons and environments in Destiny boring. I also have to add, yes its one biome, but its a biome which is larger than almost all of Destiny 2's biomes combined. Yes, there's ruins, but those ruins have plenty of variety. Temples, cities, shanty towns, and plenty of interesting nature and variety between them. Think for yourself rather than trying to wield some shitty youtuber's opinion as your own.   
---
   
---
But to return to my point, the problem isn't not being satisfied with Anthem. Not every game is for everyone, but to entirely ignore Destiny 2's problems and put it up on a pedestal as if its done everything right, when its basically done everything that people are complaining about with Anthem, is absolutely ridiculous.
---
last word
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Hopefully his insurance payed for all of your injuries 
---
Sure I'll see if I can find it for you. You can also have the ftl boot 4 people, have the remaining 2 make it to the end, and then have the 4 rejoin at the next cp.
---
Nah
---
No and no they are not the coolest shit ever, that's some horrific shit.
---
I was just thinking today about how to practice with a super and how to get real comfortable. I came up with starting up a solo private match with Mayhem as the game type + max super charge rate and just supering around the different maps with no pressure to get kills.. just to get accustomed to the movement and all that.
---
The second one looks like the insurmountable skullfort
---
It's the monster from silent hill if I remember correctly 
---
Yeah

Rule 5 my dude. No promoting, including clans

Rule 6. 
---
Cool guy is so underated.
---
Yeah it really is - I just happen to be on the losing end way more often - then again, I lack all the current meta weapons and stay stubborn with my Pulse + not perfectly rolled Trust
---
Khackis is a shit YouTuber
---
Pro-tip: adjust the playback speed of his vids to 1.25 or 1.5. 
---
Or you could just have actual principles and state that it is extremely anti-consumer for any AAA publisher to a release game that is unfinished. 
---
Bungie; I see you did something cool, be shame if you disconnected... 
---
#2 looks like an ornament for Insurmountable Skullfort.
---
Yea u need to get forsaken, but how bungle did it is that if you don’t buy forsaken and the annual pass you can’t do anything, and a new season is starting next Tuesday with gambits wild
---
The gameplay in Anthem is legit though. I understand having issues with the bugs and holding out cause of that. I personally don't care cause flying around in the javelins is super awesome, and I can't wait to get back into it on release.
---
Little late with this one
---
Stopped following houndish as soon as I realized his content comes from Reddit... I'm on Reddit right now

I didn't know porn was allowed on Reddit.

Let's see what we've guac

Not too late at all.

---
Lol, I was just coming here to comment that along the same lines.  Listening to the grunts absolutely freak out when fighting against you was great hahaha
---
No. Cries for nerfs are what caused so many problems in D1. 
---
That's actually a really good idea.
---
And my axe.
---
WELCOME TO MOE'S!!
---
A perfect counter....
---
In some other games, you now would get a combo-death :D
---
Nipples
---
100% true. 
---
HOWEVER, Anthem is now releasing in a world where the rocky Destiny 1 launch has already taken place and been remedied (no matter how slowly it took Bungie), so it is assumed that Anthem would have learned from Bungie's mistakes. 
---
As much hate as you want to give destiny, it was delving into uncharted territory. A not-quite-MMO shared world looter shooter. Therefore it's more understanding, in my opinion, for them to have made big mistakes in the formula early on. 
---
Anthem on the other hand is releasing 6 years after vanilla Destiny, and repeating all the same mistakes and then some, which is more worrisome and in some small way, less acceptable. 
---
Did you win?
---
Using the joining alies spots (one top right on cliff side and by map room ruble facing door look left) you can reset your debuff. Other than that I would say run only warlocks and stay in your own well for damage(you can't get the same buff with 3 people) aswell as the relic jump dash for warlocks like there sword dash(jump then activate your glide and swing at the same time). Run 2 shotguns and wisper or run a sniper, shotgun and whisper. Shoot the cylinder on his back to extend the phase when you can.
---
This is what I strive for. I just try to be better than the other team's worst.
---
It's funny, I am either the best on my team or the worst, almost never an in-between.
---
Well I mean thorn was a liiiittleee bit broken...vex was a monster and doctrine was a minigun with sniper range and stability of a laser beam... d1 had more balance issues than d2.

Holy fuck I had to watch this 4 times to realize what happened ('-'  )

It is? Do you have a source?

Or remove the one remaining eye.

Ya. They can melt fast if you’re accurate. Which is why I say the other two are better off. They do more damage on a hit target whereas prometheus kind of spreads it through its aoe making it a slower time to kill on single target. 
---
Downside is that it uses special ammo and only starts with 50 which is good for two kills usually. 3 if you’re really accurate without picking up more ammo. 
---
These changes have essentially been the same since forsaken though without too much changing and you really don’t see them used too much. 
---
About menu loading screens, if you're talking about them taking ages to load, in theory they started improbing them a couple of updates ago but nothing noticeable. 
---
Fuck prick cockass
---
If that's true I might try that, 61 clears no bow, 1k, ship or sparrow. 
---
I was using ace of spades, badlander, and play of the game. Im a 630 titan I just started playing again
---
And I was using sunbreaker with code of the siege breaker 
---
It’s a looter-shooter; an FPS. There are some similarities to an mmorpg (as it borrows elements from that genre), but the story is relatively short, you can get to the maximum level fairly quickly, and the bulk of your time is spent in endgame grinding up your power (a secondary leveling mechanic which is based on your gear), acquiring loot, etc. 
---
The story can be completed solo; some activities are match-made or in a public area where random players can join in, and then the most advanced activities require you to form a group. There are LFG resources if you don’t have a group. 
---
There isn’t a complex or highly customizable modding system; all of the weapons are what they are and you can enhance them with a “mod”, which just makes it easier to aim, bigger magazine, better handling, etc, but none of them change the weapon intrinsically. A big plus on weapons is the gun play feels great, imo. 
---
The biggest thing to realize is that this is an FPS at heart. At the end of the game, you have access to all the same skills and gear of any other player (provided you’ve received said gear as a random drop, done the quest to get it, etc). The 3 classes are unique in their way but it’s not like one class can do something that another absolutely can’t in terms of gameplay. You’re going to be doing basically the same thing throughout the game (go here, shoot stuff, then move on), with some variations (some of the endgame activities also involve certain puzzle mechanics to do damage to an enemy, trigger/advance an encounter, jumping puzzles, stuff like that). It’s not a survival game or a big open-world one. I love the game but I could see it being really repetitive if you’re expecting something different.
---
tfw when you're a warlock and your cast time of the only shutdown-super you have is abysmally large so the titan still kills you
---
Its my main weapon. Have fun
---
What if the healing/shielding it gave was relevant to your health?
---
Say I'm at half health and I get the kill, my health jumps to full but with half the shielding.
---
If I were healed by a warlock to full and I get a kill in that moment I would get the full shield.
---
Luckily there’s almost always a tldr in the comments 
---
Man, I’ve been there before, lemme tell ya.
---
If you have Forsaken (it comes with Curse of Osiris and Warmind), you will want to start with the CoO missions, then Warmind, then Forsaken.  Make sure you save your highest light weapons as you lvl for your alts. (If you do not have them yet, make them.  It will help with lvling.)  Story missions and the Orange &amp; Blue missions on each planet should be your priority, but make sure to complete any available milestones prior to reset each week to help with leveling.  If none of your characters are a lvl 30 yet, use your boost to make your lowest, or a new one, lvl 30.  This will also complete everythign through Warmind for you and let you start Forsaken quicker.  I recommend your lowest, because it will decrease more of the duplicated grind for you.
---
Use a fireteam medallion everytime to you play to increase xp and loot drops.
---
Becareful with infusion.  Infusion is expensive, so if you can infuse like items it is best.  Otherwise only infuse if the piece you are wanting to upgrade is your got to have to play piece and will be going up by at least 8 light.  Also, as a returning player you should already know, but just in case, becarful about infusing exotics.  You can only equip one exotic weapon and one exotic armor piece.  You do not want to accidently make your highest helmet and your highest gloves both exotics.  It will hurt your max light.
---
Join a clan, if you haven't already.  You will then get a weekly clan XP power gear for completing clan xp bounties, and several other lvl drops for clan activities (if it is an active clan).
---
If you want to get the annual pass, wait until you are closer to lvl 600 to do so.  You cannot do any of the AP stuff until you hit 600. 
---
i haven't done raids either so that works out. sent you a friend request
---
Yeah, they do have that video, and chaos reach was effective against it, only the banner shield was immune. Any Nova bomb destroys it, Thundercrash breaks it, and FoH you just run in and kill the guy in it, ending it. Also, they've not tested since hammer sunspots were improved, and the top tree hammers have no issues, either. Spectral Blades and Pole Dancer just walked in and Merc the caster. The only supers it protects against is Nova Warp, if you're smart about it, Shadowshot, and TickleFingers. Wooo. Even casting the mobile shield you can just waltz in and kick ass.
---
exact same roll and MW, id say yeah if you MW it
---
Whether we wanted it or not
---
Thanks man. We need a Sherpa lol.
---
Which time zone are you in?
---
you dont need the piercing rounds to get a collat. just need the lineup
---
If people still use Guided games I am going to try that with Riven and maybe help some people lol
---
 Interesting. So it sounds kind of like left 4 dead 2 where there is quite a bit of filler which, for the most part is very easy, and frankly is just to warm you up for the harder stuff. What you mentioned, raids, sound like the more difficult aspects of left4dead 2 where you have to play really well and make as few mistakes as possible to survive. 
---
Not to ramble, but i want to mention that in the l4d2 workshop there is a mode called "helms deep" (4p). I have played this specific scenario at least 200 times, and it doesnt get boring. Out of those 200 attempts, i have only beaten it about 8 times. I really enjoy those kinds of challenges. With the right group, i could probobly beat it far more often, but its very challenging with random people.
---
Upon doing further research, i am a bit dissapointed to see that the AI in destiny 2 isn't quite on-par with l4d2, but l4d2 is still the gold standard in AI, so thats not neccassarily surprising.
---
Ill go ahead grab it, its only 30 bucks. Only reason i see myself hating it, is if its just too easy. I have no desire to play something thats too easy. 
---
est. i can play all 3 subclasses and i got a homie that i play with like everyday
---
10/10 i think cayde banged his sister....savage 
---
Just cut that number by 79 and you’re golden!
---
Cool shotgun! Which one?
---
As far as I\`m aware, Xbox population is close to none and PC and PS4 were sharing somewhat similar %. 
---
I’m gonna end this convo with a 💩🧦
---
lol yeah this is what the fanboys keep forgetting. No one is defending how awful D1/D2 launches were...simply that they already happened and Anthem should have had a leg up against them by having the ability to not repeat their dumb mistakes.
---
It's basically all I use until I get Phoenix Protocol.
---
Wow.
---
Yeah. You won’t see real challenge until the endgame, but also I think Destiny makes up for that somewhat by the guns feeling great to shoot, and your abilities give you moments of heady power. It’s worth $30 for sure imo. 
---
Also, side note, if you’re a lore person, there is a lot of lore in Destiny but most of it you have to go reading or digging for. The main story doesn’t really fill you in on the depth of it at all, but it’s really interesting if you like that kind of thing. 
---
It's probably one of the best PVE exotic armor pieces in the game. I don't roll middle tree without it.
---
Probably remove the bonus overshield. People already have incentive enough to just go and get kills - they don’t need to reward for being cheeky. It just causes and annoying snowball effect where it allows them to get more kills much easier.
---
yes I did? i’m sorry you didn’t?
---
I need this in my life
---
i eat ass
---
Both of the other dreaming city lost sectors are faster because you arent gated off from the boss. 
---
I was actually disappointed not to wake up in a wagon.
---
Agreed. But I still ain't gonna send you a booty pic
---
You missed the point completely with what we said. Our opinoins mind you. I have had this arguement with other people in the past. The core game with what you are bound to repeat (ie. Abilities and shooting) is what I dont like. Their is alot of little things that I can see being fixed in the future but with the core of the game not being exciting to me I cant see myself playing it anymore. I have sunk about 20 hours into anthem and I'm thankful for orginal premier or I would have been stuck with it. 
---
It wouldn’t technically be a curated roll but it’s roll matches the curated roll, making its roll curated. But it’s not a curated roll. 
---
It only drops from completing the Master Smith triumph which is Forging 100 weapons. 
---
I did Tractor cannon first. My buddy is the one who recorded the video but I'm the other warlock using Tractor. Depends on the amount of Primeval Slayer you have.
---
Hit me up anytime topherboy123 is my psn I play nights with my clan mates we do raids comp quick play whatever we just like to have fun 
---
It's even better than the curated roll, since you've got options on top of the curated's. Nice one.
---
You have to complete the Master Smith triumph for forging weapon frames to earn the ship. 
---
I had s lot of fun in Leviathan with my friends
---
I've watched this three times now and still don't understand how he could find the corner and line that shot up while the person is dropping down.
---
This is correct.
---
It's much harder to get the same level of resilience on a hunter. They're meant to be mobile and not get hit. You're better off cranking up the mobility and recovery as best you can and learning to evade. I run all my gear with either a super or mobility mod and play from cover. That is, however, just my opinion. It's worked for me since day 1 of D1 though and matches my usual fps play style.
---
People that were calling Anthem a "Destiny killer" didn't help much either. Same thing happened with the Division. No one gave a shit about it until everyone started claiming it would destroy Destiny. Then it didn't and it became a meme among the D1 community.
---
Idk, maybe I'm just weird, but I've loved pretty much every second I've put into D1 and D2 at every point in the series' history. Sometimes the PvP meta is annoying and content gets a little boring, but I've never thought it was a broken or bad game. It's the only series I've been able to pick up and play again after putting it down for a period of time. I usually never play anything more than once. 
---
I remember that ! So OP indeed
---
It also increases damage out put and the main requirement is to be shot. Literally be shot.
---
Let me put it another way: this exotic requires nothing more than for you to play *poorly* before it triggers.
---
"Hello Guardian."
---
Stuck since reset*
---
I didn't. You just ignored it when I specifically pointed out that "impactfulness" is subjective. You don't get to pass off your feelings as facts about the game.
---
I’m sick after seeing that spelling of crucible with an S
---
I wish I knew that getting to level 50 isn't a big deal.
---
sent you a fr. my psn is pretty close to my reddit name
---
Well first thing is first: it needs to be harder to trigger than "take damage".
---
Wall hacks for *taking* damage is borderline stupid. It should be triggered by good play, not poor play.
---
Secondly, it has WAY too much going on. Healing, overshield, wall hacks, and increased damage output? Wtf were the devs thinking?
---
Yup just accepted it anytime u see me on or see me in a chat feel free to join up I play with a bunch of really great ppl, my clan is all about helping other. And if u need a clan to join u can join mine if u would like.
---
I really miss having a solar sins of the past. 
---
Well yeah... You see, the way a lot of video games work is: You get a quest, complete it, and get a reward. If the reward is something you like (a cool looking, pretty powerful hand cannon, for instance), it makes you happy. You should perhaps learn to enjoy the little things, instead of being toxic over someone else's happiness.
---
Ahh. OK. So can you forge as many frames as you want to work towards that triumph? 
---
Welp, i missed the damage buff entirely. Going to edit that in.
---
It shouldn't exist in the first place tho.
---
What sniper is that?
---
Is ThAt ThE cUbE fRoM fOrTnItE?!?!!?
---
The problem is if I see a teammate fighting a titan and as I run up to engage, my teammate dies. Now I'm entering a fight against a full health titan with an over shield and extra damage. It'd be one thing to just get full health but suddenly I'm at a huge disadvantage because one of my teammates lost a firefight. There isn't any other perk, mod, or buff that comes close to this. 
---
Is there a Drifter I can light on fire and throw in the toilet after I skip his intro monologue that I've seen eleventy billion times? 
---
Give Rahool a break!  Dude used to be decrypting some high end engrams.  Now he basically buys used paint.
---
That, was a LOT of ether.
---
Brilliant! Hahaha
---
Storm is the exception. Also Anthem is ability based and the guns feel awful to me. 
---
I think the "unfairness" isn't in the initial firefight but any guardian who is about to engage that titan after his vengeance processes. Now instead of going against even a full health opponent, it's a full health opponent with over shield and extra damage. Only thing I know of similar is well of radiance and not only is that a super but also restricts your movements. 
---
Are you doing it in the hallows? I specifically remember that one step you must do it in the hallows. Make sure you read the quest step word for word.
---
Are you doing it in the hallows? I'm not sure why it's not turning heroic but I know I did several in the wrong spot.
---
I mugged Saladin
---
They must have ripped it off. 
---
My biggest issue is ...there is no grind. I can do all of weekly DC in 2-3 hours, and then it's only one Legendary bounty daily :(
---
If all the plates took too long, under the minute mark, I don't think that counts as heroic. 
---
Give the opposite side the same perks so if you shoot them you also get the wall hack and overshield and Health regen if you kill them. Make it a dueling exotic 
---
This was the true winner in this thread
---
That's probably my what it is then 
---
Best to do it with others helping. Unless they're all useless randoms.
---
havent played much of destiny/destiny 2 since d1. been on and off. that warlock though. too many memories😭😭
---
60. Congrats you hit 2110 
---
Wait, does this mean that Destiny 2 was kept totally secret from the Anthem devs? They couldn't have learned from the problems another game in the same genre had?! 
---
Is there one that's faster?
---
Rule 13. 
---
"Hello Guardian, what you think you're doing!?"
---
We'll work up to it. a/s/l?
---
Nope. That links staying blue. 
---
I feel so blessed by RNG when it comes to the mars exotics, I got them all within the first 8 Mars engram drops. 
---
Let me tell you something. It's not pie but it feels like warm apple pie
---
they all have to be at gofannon I believe
---
I love it! It always amuses me whenever I come across floating enemies after a battle, but I don't think I have ever had one float up that high. Lol!
---
She was great on Io. Ikora's calm determination was played excellently against Asher Mir's frantic condescension. Love their back-and-forth, especially in the Pyramidion strike.
---
&gt;he was one of the YTers that spread around the "On the disc" stuff in D1.
---
What was that?
---
Bring a platter
---
they're better because (A) they take more skill to use and (B) they're more fun to use
---
Fyi these invites time out in 1 day so if you need new ones DM me.
---
warlocks aren't garbage, rift is very goo- HHAHAHAHAHA
---
It's ridiculous how they are just not needing OEM at all. This mask is still op it should just give you an overshield
---
This was a riven run. A last wish run would be all encounters. Everybody can cluster bomb riven and run the heart in one quick go...
---
Would have been more savage if he said something like "Hey, tell Mara that Shaxx says hi"
---
Jaw drops
---
I guess you could label it “embarrassing” but not really. This mans earned his title and wants to show other peeps, let him flex! Don’t see the point on your negative comment tbh.
---
Good call
---
That doesn't help. They seemed to have been glitching to stay in that area and not bombardment you
---
