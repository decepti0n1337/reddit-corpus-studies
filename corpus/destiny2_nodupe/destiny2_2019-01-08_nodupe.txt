At launch of forsaken you had to kill the guy invading, on your side of gambit, 5 times. The issue was that the invaders usually come with heavy, and get an overshield, so getting these kills was very difficult and ultimately depended on the invader being an absolute dunce, and even then you only get a very limited number of chances in each game to do this. It was bad, but not as bad as the lunas quest.
---
thats not too bad
---
That's a nice controller you have there Johnny, would be a shame if something were to happen to it.
---
Are you are fucking roleplayer???
---
The TTK is absurd and can't be outgunned when a decent player is using it. I'm dying to get it, as I'm pretty happy with my performance in Crucible and know this gun would be ridiculous when I get used to it. Definitely gonna be worth the grind.

Thanks for believing in me. You give me faith.

That does sound pretty monstrous.

Thanks for the full explanation, makes more sense now.

Crooked is hella good but a tad harder to use than QB. 
---
For the record I use baligant, le monarche, crooked.

A little off-topic, but how do some people feel about some Y1 weapons like Dire Promise (Dead Orbit hand cannon), Inaugural Address (Leviathan pulse rifle; still my favorite pulse rifle), and Play of the Game? Or even old-meta like masterwork Graviton Lance/Vigilance Wing, Colony, etc etc?
---
Thanks...I think...
---
There's a community discord for LFG. Check the clan recruitment channel! 
---
I love all those guns and they still feel so great to use...I've just recently gotten Forsaken though and right now I've just been trying out all the Forsaken guns I've received along with adjusting to the Crucible's current meta. Still don't have the Colony though

Sometimes i feel bad about mercing people thoüòÇ a part of my soul dies when i kill someone with more than 10 motes

I thought Bungie have been enjoying their Christmas for the past two weeks?

We were getting feed back prior to the holidays, there has been an expected pause and now I‚Äôm expecting everything to kick off again after this week. Let‚Äôs just hold out for their first ‚Äònews blast‚Äô this week.

Oh yh lol I have no idea then
---
No problem. That it's where much of the end game is. 
---
Read the description again.
---
Im dead in the pit, thinking I was still playing on my titan.

The claymore was a pretty easy quest compared to the broadsword or lunas.

whenever i do the bottom method i feel like mirio togata from mha

Don‚Äôt most titans use catapult to titan skate?
---
Bounties. Rare shaders. 
---
The people who almost killed ada's mum in that lore are described as man with flying drones. Does that sound familiar? 
---
Yeah, it took me a bit to get there but i knew when i got there id be unstoppable with it, and i became extremely good
---
I never really stuck to one kind of weapon. I just used whatever was fun. But I was so bad with NLB that it wasn‚Äôt even fun at that point.
---

Sad Titan. 
---
Good to know thanks
---
Also, look for an afk person, makes it ezpz. 
---
Average? You are below average. You got carried lol 
---
Thunderlord does not do as much damage as cluster bomb rockets. This is because each and every cluster hits Riven. 
---
I have not heard of a team only running Thunderlords doing this, but I have done it in teams where two people had Thunderlord and the rest of us used rockets. It is also possible if everyone uses the Prospector exotic grenade launcher, but even that does less damage than cluster rockets. 
---
Same. I was surprised when I saw a video showing how to clear that room by ledge jumping, and I don't know how anyone could manage doing that room and still have time to finish. 
---
Bottom without a doubt.  Does waaaaaay too many times using the top one going down to Atheon. 
---
Thanks for your contribution to the community mate.

And just funner.

Its fun to cheat death ok

He was so close to death, why would you even bother popping your well?
---
That's not a normal rift. It's a warlock super. Its stronger then regular rifts.
---
\*Taken Goblin immunes the Primeval just as you pop your super
---
That's a super I've only killed a person inside that rift once

Always fall then jump
---
I guess lock mains have learned how to destiny with a lock jump.

Titans are a little annoying cuz I overshoot a lot. But the skating makes up for it.

I thought it was a good idea.

Woot woot! He better propose hahaha!

I love this ...
---
Whoa, that sounds wonderful
---
I wanted to come back to this because honestly the moment I hit Legendary I don‚Äôt like playing Gambit anymore. I‚Äôm clearly being placed against players and stacks now. All the way up to Legendary I never saw what the problem was people were talking about of going against stacks, I never saw them.
---
Atta boy!!

I got mine hoping for more (any) D2 lore. It‚Äôs all D1 and I never played D1. RIP.

Twas a good couple matches, yes

I mean a guy had the Telesto, but still he only got like 5 kills in the entire match

My sister just got engaged a few weeks ago. I never met the guy, but this past weekend I learned he's into video games and comic books. Instantly earned many points in his favor.

Yeet. That's pretty nice my dude
---
That's not a double jump :P

What platform are you on?

I want to downvote you if so bad... I can't do it though. Congrats on the drops

Oh hell yes.

Anyone who drives an accord is welcome to my family too!

The gambit kills were hard as fuck. Bungo are you shitters?

That's odd she talks to me all the time.

Throw a grenade on the chest and guaranteed exotic.

I had a dude who was level 1 in crucible. He raised to lv 3 after that game.

If you have black armory, go talk to ada to unlock the quest chain.   People will reappear.

Y1 Play of the Game rarely leaves my heavy slot if I‚Äôm trying hard. Such a good gun.

Inaugural Address is also a solid weapon 
---
On Nessus? 
---
oh i know, just let it die.
---
Doing Luna howl who at bungie approved this Shit
---
Oh yeahhhhh Sleeper, imo it was never "op" (atleast on the pc side of things) Queensbreaker's hit box was dumb 
---
Suros modular is pretty snazzy as well
---
IIRC you can't due to your light level being too low to even do any damage to the bosses.
---
This is the roll I‚Äôve been after. After more then 20 tries, I didn‚Äôt think frenzy and rampage was possible. I‚Äôve got the frenzy killclip roll but prefer my drop mag, zen moment and rampage build. 
---
Yes along with Telesto and Nova Warp
---
What's that gun? Some part of my mind recognizses it but I can't put a name to it
---
I have the high ground
---
Nice
---
I think this is just one of those social miscommunications that happen inevitably. It does not mean you meant it in a sexist way, but it definitely could be taken as such by a rational person. 
---
&gt;the b*tch
---
You should also be careful with characteristic-specific insults like that. I feel like most of the time people use words such as this (b*tch, f*gg*t, m*ng*l**d, words like that) without actually thinking of how it sounds to others.
---
Edited to censor the unkind words. This is a subreddit that does not like such things. 
---
"Was I being unintentionally sexist?" he asks. He then proceeds to call the woman a bitch for getting annoyed and leaving after she just spent the time to clearly explain the encounter mechanics and have that be undermined by someone reading a guide.
---
OR MAYBE SHE LEFT THE PARTY FOR THE CHECKPOINT THEN YES SHES A BITCH BUT ON OTHER NOTE YOU SOULDVE ASK ON REPEATIN IT AGAIN OR JUST SAY IM GONNA READ IT FROM HOW TO RAID FOR DUMMIES FORM ON WHICH RAID YOUR DOIN. 
---
SEXIST MEANING relating to or characterized by prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex.
---
"his attitude to women is patronizing and sexist"
---
So when read it out loud after she explained it u didnt do nothing wrong.
---
üòÇü§£üòÇü§£ Accurate and funny.
---
Nah I dont miss that one bit
---
I don't think saying bitch makes me sexist. I'd refer to a guy as an asshole. I don't think a gender specific insult is bad.  
---
I don't have a problem with the general consensus saying I was unintentionally sexist. I just wanted some opinions on the matter. 
---
How do you like the mountaintop? I grinder for, and solo earned, my Luna. But grenade launchers are not really my thing? Do you think the Mountaintop is with it for someone that does not normally use a grenade launcher? I commonly pair my Luna with a sniper or a shotgun. Map depending. Thanks.

What system are you on  ? I've been trying to get SOTP done 
---
I just use a normal legendary auto rifle. Sometimes i even use a common auto rifle.
---
Is that the curated roll or did you just Masterwork it yourself?
---
Yep! I have the BA shaders on other weapons, love it too! But I instantly got wow‚Äôed by this one on the Hammerhead in particular. üòÅ
---
Took me 20+ runs to get my Ikelos Shotgun I think. Got every other Ikelos Weapon in the first 10 or so...Didnt use any of them so far...dont think I will.
---
Indeed!
---
For solo que it\`s really good 
---
Am not sure if I have it in my collections tho, since I never got it as a drop. Gotta check. If I do ill put another shader
---
It's not a trace, but I did replicate the picture as it was the only good picture I could get
---
No farm. Just keep doing nilestones and raids. Start a new character if you are running out
---
I masterworked this one. I don‚Äôt think there are actual ‚Äúcurated‚Äù rolls for Black Armory weapons. I could be wrong though.
---
I do give props for you going that far
---
just got a 23 kill game but i also deposited 70 motes and won my game. this is weak sauce if ive ever seen it. you may have been the reason your team lost
---
We're all one-eyed willy now.
---
Steady rounds? Not accurized?
---
Wasn't even close enough at the time to do that and still got launched off.
---
Chaperone has been tested at 13.5m-14m kill range and 16 with roadborn active. Dunno where you get 20 from.
---
Yep, high jump with stompees is insane. But it‚Äôs situational. I mean if you tend to jump around a lot, what you shouldn‚Äôt, then high jump makes you an exceptional target from everywhere on the map. When you use it right it can be insane.

It would be funny if it made sense, but the smg sucks against her.
---
We were talking about with friends (sarcastically) that the smg is the best weapon and riven would die by herself. Yeah, not funny, but I decided to do this lol
---
Meh, not really. If they were better, I'd use them. But if you want to win you have to use a specific set anyways, so it doesnt really matter
---
Ah, fair.
---
Git gud. 
---
I'm on pc, so I dont find it hard to control at all. Mine's almost maxed out on range. If i use the long range sight it goes to 100. Ill be honest, dont even know if Ill ever have a use case for all that range lol
---
You can get it in exotic engrams 
---
As someone who's avoided parkour in many other games like counter strike, minecraft, etc. this mission was a nightmare
---
Agreed
---
Going through these points one at a time for my own opinion on the topic. You have some good points but some are also just short sighted IMO.
---
1) Raids. For this I feel you only looked at the Y1 raids, since LW was fantastic. Yeah, they overlooked the whole rockets thing but the sheer amount of mechanics and required skill in the raid is far more interesting than sitting at a conflux and shooting Vex coming from the same door over and over or collecting scrap for a giant Zamboni. Every raid has it's ups and downs, but I feel Crota is a good example that both games had terrible raids. As someone who Sherpas people through raids, meaning I teach dozens of Kinderguardians how to raid in D1 and D2, I can say that I much more enjoy mechanic heavy encounters. It feels more alive than just shoot the things and wait for the relic to do something. The only D1 raid encounters that felt equally as Mechanic heavy were really in King's Fall. Wrath of the Machine, as fun as it was, ended up just being "Shoot the stuff and wait a bunch". This is more of an opinion I suppose but D1 was just as shifty with raids. Vault was Nostalgic, but the actual depth of mechanics was shallow as hell. 
---
2) Crucible. I'll give it to you, Crucible isn't so great right now. However, Bungie has ALWAYS been quietly enforcing meta picks with their patches since D1 got it's first patch. The can claim 'balance' as much as they want, it's transparent that their patches always make something too strong. On the flip side I don't think D1 was more alive in it's weapon play when the game was just so stiff and the physics felt off half the time. Plus all the quality of life adjustments to abilites make them so much more smooth to apply in D2 crucible.
---
3) Exotics. Let's go down the useless ones in D1. Hard light was just as useless then as it is now. Trespasser. All of the Reskin Y3 exotics from the "Updated Raids' nonsense. Having the element proved to not be as great as an exotic slot for most. Monte Carlo, arguably Crucible gun or just a 'who cares shoot the things' gun. First Curse. No time to Explain (Shittier Black Hammer). Boolean Gemini. Zen Meteor. Patience and Time (debatable but still not worth exotic slot in PvP or PvE). Super Good Advice. Young Wolf's Howl. The two *NOT* Dark-Drinker swords. This is just the guns too. You talk about how you can 'build' around all these special exotics when most of the time they are just fun guns. D2 has plenty of those two if you're out in strikes or whatever. Raiding in D1 was just as Meta heavy as it is in D2. And if anything there are more options for those without the high meta weapons to use as opposed to those who forced teams to use 1 exotic for their raiding. 
---
3) Subclasses all had shitty perks. Each one, they all had nodes no one used unless they were just messing around. When it came to high level play there were specific builds everyone used, this is probably a good indicator as to why a fixed perk system is useful. Now you just have the good set ups put together ahead of time. Yeah it would be nice to mix some of the perks but if you could put the Solar Ability damage up of the Big boy hammer on the Shoulder charge class then there would be NO reason to use the other two branches. You'd be god.
---
4) End game loot? Really? Endgame. The Y3 "Raid revival" was just taking old guns and reskinning half of them as 'Exotic'. In King's Fall the Scout, Handcannon, Shotgun, Fusion (Arguably), and Rocket Launcher were all shit tier. Ignored for the most part. VoG had the best set of weapons of any D1 raid and that was because they all had fixed god rolls, SOUNDS A LOT LIKE SOMETHING IN D2 HMMMMMMMMMMM. *Cough* Levi *Cough*. When Random Rolls and new perks came in most were just shit altogether. Crota brought in Triple tap, cool. After that none others were brought. Crota scout, trash. Crota Auto, so situational might as well not be there. Crota fusion, who remembers it? The D1 end game loot was basically "Boy I hope I get the good gun this time, all the rest of this is shit." On top of that the rotating vendors sold EXCLUSIVELY reskinned shit. I think Y3 was the first time they brought new gun models in and within a few updates there were reskins. Also, Wrath of the Machine was all reskins. All of them. So yeah. Also, on that topic the "Oh just a great gun in another slot" argument is weak when people were CLAMMERING for Fate Bringer and Gjallarhorn knock offs in Y2 and Y3. OMG this strike drops the 'Prototype' Fate Bringer. Crota rocket is Gjallarhorn? Let's go find Cluster Tracking rockets everywhere. Does this Rocket have Tripple tube? No? Trash. Ooh, this Matador has the same roll as the Final Verdict, yay. I'll give you one leg up, Iron Banner and the Forge weapons from D1 were nice. There were some good weapon models. Those aren't really endgame though. Trials guns were pretty recycled. Tack on an extra doodad, new paint, new gun? Yeah, sure. Nice sights at least.
---
5) The player base drops was due to the poor reception for the 2 primaries system. However, there was a small group in the community asking for the possibility for 2 primaries in D1. They tried it and it didn't work, but claiming they went back to the D1 weapon system is completely false. D1 had hard locked slots, D2 has more freedom. This is a new system in of itself. To say they had to revert a bunch of stuff is just a lie. They evolved a new system out of the marriage of D1 and D2Y1. Time gating sucks but who remembers Simulant, the 3 Class Specific guns, First Curse. Weapons that needed resets. Things get time gated, oh well. At least we don't have 3 day crafting wait times like Warframe does. Be grateful for what we have. 
---
In short, I disagree with some of your points. I believe D2 is the gateway to a better and broader Destiny experience and it feels like it should have been in D1. If D1 had the D2 weapons and class system it would have been played entirely different, so don't go saying they had to "Implement D1 stuff." It's just bullshit.
---
That wasn't very pheasant of you
---
The area is called salt mines, jokingly in referance to the crucible where the term being salty means to be upset and complaining
---
Where's the lie? - Chaperone users apeing.
---
HALLEJULAH!
---
The Fated Engrams Xur sells too?
---
Yeah I imagine I'd be using a sniper or something else at that point haha
---
True but for me it‚Äôs a need to find something different to use. It‚Äôs why I use a bow the majority of the time. I love that it‚Äôs not meta and destroying somebody with it feels that much better 
---
Bungie tried new things in D2, some of it has worked out, some of it was pretty poor but at least they‚Äôre fixing their mistakes and improving on a much more concrete model. 
---
D2 is better than D1 now and will only get better.
---
Here is hoping for an excellent execution with D3.
---
After years, I've finally found the reason why I subbed here in the first place. Thank you my friend
---
Yup, there it is. 
---
If you can, pop super then open menu and equip celestial nighthawk as this extends the duration every time you get damage/ kills  . This only refers to PvP tho
---
Yep, thats how i did it. Dranged down the trash mobs and then Sturm for the win...
---
D2 raids *SUCK* compared to D1. Last wish is the only one that can compare, the rest is playing a japanese game show and doing an alien emperors chores. Also, I used to be able to live in the strike playlist, but for D2 I just get the power engram and I'm done. People saying D2 has better raids and strikes are in hardcore denial.
---
I definitely believe that D1 was simply the better game and not for nostalgic reasons, but D2 was executed poorly with crap game design at the beginning and CoO did not make that any better it was at Warmind through Forsaken D2 became really good but I don't think it was as good as TTK. I respect your opinion though. Have you played D1, in order to justify your opinion.
---
WOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!! They Wanted to fight you Right?! Thats what they Said!
---
I'm also 99% sure that the final motes deposited to summon the Primeval won't spawn a blocker on the enemy side. If that's the case, it's actually pointless to even bank more than the required number of motes to hit 75.
---
Lol, same
---
My clan is alot of older people and parents and they have a blast as they're fun to play with (Me and my friend are the youngest in clan teens)
---
A missed headshot?
---
For the blight one just equip the wardcliff coil. Easy heroic. 
---
IMO D1 still has much better strikes. It‚Äôs not that D2s are bad, but D1 ones were just so fun to me.
---
Stupid click bait
---
I use high jump on console personally. Strafe for PvP.
---
True. But I didn't wanna break open the subclass jar, otherwise there would be a straight-up war on the most bullcrap supers and/it exotics üòÇ

I‚Äôm always using those two extras peddles for reload/change weapons.

Forsaken &gt; ttk but base game d1 is better d2 has better game mechanics and a smoother engine but in the same way d1 seemed more smooth with still having complex features the raids and strikes were thought out and fun imo d1 was kinda ruined strike wise in ttk and the raid was okay Crota and vog were fun and they had their flaws but they weren‚Äôt there unless you abused them one of most fun things in d1 was having fun doing different strategies or cheeses but in d2 it‚Äôs the same thing over and over compared to d1 also in d1 the story was driving and really pulled you in while d2 story felt quick and forced as a person who preordered both and was equally excited my opinions are d1 base game vs d2 base d1 is better dlc 1 d1 vs d2 d1 dlc 2 d1 vs d2 tie forsaken vs ttk the easiest one yet forsaken I have hope for the games future but I‚Äôm not expecting anything I want a well thought through story where they try to balance the features without blocking things away without the intention of a pay gate I want a raid that has multiple strategies but be completed with less than 6 people for a difficult challenge I want simple yet complex ideas that drive the game forward and most of all I want exotics that are fun some are practice and some are jokes I want a blend of forsaken and d1 base game into a well thought out masterpiece that doesn‚Äôt feel like a money grab and instead feels like they had passion and truly care about the games feel
---
Bungie's MM is generally such a stinky pile of hot trash that I'd rather have an active group finder within the game itself. I do agree with you on the necessity of it, I just don't want it implemented. At least as of now.
---
I prefer Catapult (on console, so not for skating). 
---
You can somewhat do the bounce/dip/bounce feel of a triple jump with catapult jump it also is harder to track for being shot in crucible and offers higher heights in PvE. 
---
Se tonight
---
I didn't conflict myself I said exotics offered utility and gave an example of synergy between exotics that you claimed weren't in d1. I mean for God sakes Mechaneers Tricksleeves buff side arms when wounded are you serious? D2 had to bring back so many exotics from d1 I'm still wondering why we even lost them in the first place.
---
And my point is mods were implemented because armor perks were shit and weapon perk pools were drastically diminished because of fear of being overpowered in the crucible. Raid armor didn't need a mod where you do more damage to taken, vex etc because it already had raid specific perks you didnt have to hope dropped on a curated masterwork. Which also is useless since it only mainly gives elemental damage reduction in super and barely see significant increases even when fully masterworked.
---
Those are fine raids, they're just not BETTER than the old raids.

---
Ok how about a idea that maybe you didn't think of. I know it's a crazy idea about here we go: Don't use it if you don't like it. You can continue to play with premades or go lfr sites. Nobody will point a gun at you to play mm games. There are literally zero effect on your if they implement mm. It just gives players an option to play mm. It's not mandatory. Give me a good reason why you don't want them to implemented. How can that effect you in anyway possible? I'm waiting
---
I was able to get the ar requirements pretty easily with a 450 rpm auto rifle, and the damage boost from kill clip helps out a lot too
---
Destiny's MM is just shit. Other guardians will pop in after a little while.
---
yeah I suck at crucible so I won't be using my titan for any of the exotic quests that force you into crucible 
---
A Vegan, a PC gamer, and a cross-fitter walk into a bar. Who announces their lifestyle first?
---
I agree after all. But the armor was way better in D1, it seems like Bungo was a bit lazy in D2 when it comes to armor design. The weapons also look monotone.And dont even get me started on Ornaments. 
---
I agee with you, but holy cow that was hard to read. Formatting goes a long way my dude.
---
In my 130 leviathan clears, I can confirm that from the 3 underbellly chests, you are guaranteed one exotic at minimum, i have seen 3 once. Yes they are all year one.
---
Any autorifle with perks that enhance damage and/or reload speed. If you can get Armor Piercing on top of those, that's super helpful in Gambit. 
---
Jesus Christ, it's Jason Bourne
---
I mostly used a tigerspite with triple tap and extended mag. Ammo for days
---
That's fuckin gay. 
---
Could not agree more 
---
I use strafe lift as i did focused lift for skating in d1
---
IKR, like you want an ogre SUURREE. That'll fuckin die. Why not 50 blockers with mass boops
---
Its truuuuue d1 and it's better parts but since forsaken d2 is 100 percent better now
---
You know there's nothing wrong with having different opinions 
---
I left destiny right around the release of House of Wolves. I really enjoyed the first 6 month of destiny but forsaken is really better 
---
Woooosh
---
Yes but the person may want the stuff on their main acciunt
---
Hopefully bungie learned something from d2's release and we can start d3 in a better way.
---
False.
---
No
---
Current strikes have no unique loot, bosses have immunity phases, there's no strike scoring, no more strike intro dialogue, modifiers are not as impactful as burns, small arms, specialist, etc. Lots of strikes are just recycled story missions. The current strike playlist is NOT objectively better. 
---
This lehig iritates the fuck out of me 
---
Bad Juju, Outbreak Prime, Obsidian Mind
---
Bungie would need to improve their MM first because in its current state it is rubbish, unbalanced and buggy.
---
I don't think that MM on raids is the best idea eventhough you could say "you dont have to use raid match making if you dont like it -&gt; you still can create your own fireteam and use LFG sites".
---
At least for NFs I would wish MM would exist. Nobody said that MM instantly has to start the match. It also could put random people into a fireteam and before they launch the NF they can discuss the settings on the chat.
---
Same could apply to MM for raids (if this ever is going to be a thing). Additionally the fireteam leader could be able to set certain conditions for the Team search (like "must have mic", "must have completed before", etc).
---
Big agree
---
i agree with this 100%
---
D2 is in a really interesting spot right now. If you aren't max light then that's really all you're pushing for, but if you are up there then all the content they're putting out is right in your strike zone. D1's dlc was more just for the raids, and had an increased light level so you couldn't do it too quickly, but d2's dlc is meant to be more like a constant stream of stuff to do, with the raid being part of it.
---
me, a person who does PvE activities religiously, and all my weeklies in under three days‚Äî get an exotic? 
---
nope ):
---
Most of the bosses in D1 were just bullet sponges. I remember the only acceptable strategy of killing rockets mcdickface was to hide under the ramp or on the chandelier and shit him in the face. Most of the bosses had zero mechanics other than to be bullet sponges with three waves of enemies. 
---
*Scorn on the field!*
---
Nothing like being surprise-tethered and then exploded.
---
But you are aware that you dont have to use such a MM feature and still can go into the match with your own team?
---
I‚Äôll never forget the Vex Prosthetic hunter legs from the VoG. So awesome looking!
---
Not missing going to orbit for literally everything in D1 . Loving my D2 life as of lately. 
---
I wouldn't say so.  I'm on Legend rank (about half) and I was in some matches yesterday that were not up against good teams.  Glad to be getting some wins.  But I feel like the bar moves slower on Legend than it did in Season 4.  Seems like it's taking forever to get through it.
---
I actually went back and played D1 last night for the first time since before D2 launched.  
---
I think the actual game play itself is much smoother and the story itself is much better...but I think the little things were much nicer, such as:
---
Menus
---
Shaders
---
Skilltrees
---
Weapon alignment in slots
---
Rep grinding
---
There are just so many smaller things that I feel D1 did much better than D2, but overall I'd have to agree with you.  D2 is a better product.
---
Cheers mate, appreciate it, I'll sling you a message once I've finished work
---
except the architects... they are overpowered
---
best gambit opponents - FALLEN BITCHH
---
Oh jesus save me from this ignorant player. 
---
Alright let me just rewrite everything again so you can ignore it again. 
---
WoW matchmaking: Spam 20+ people into a DPS heavy raid. Yeah MM at its peak. Totally the same with mechanic heavy D2 raids. You go dude!
---
Yeah no difference if its a 3,4,5 or 6 man raid. Go do all Destiny raids with a fireteam of 3. Then do it with 6. if you see a difference let me know. 
---
If people fail, then they complain. When they complain, Bungie changes things for the worse. 
---
Cycle of video game companies, thats just how it goes. 
---
You CANNOT implement a proper MM for raids. Its just not possible. 
---
Like I said, MM only works for newbies, and we already have guided games. 
---
The only thing bungie needs to do is increase rewards for guided games and it will see more use. So suck through it. 
---
He said nova bomb, not warp.
---
No need to get so worked up. I already gave you my reason.
---
Hopefully what they learned is that completely ditching the prior game is a mistake with this game type and we don't actually see a D3 in the same way D2 was introduced post D1.
---
Damn I've been getting those to drop recently. I heard that from alot of ppl that those drops not giving them what they need, instead they would get duplicates. 
---
Exactly, like right now, I only got forsaken a few weeks ago and all I'm really working on is getting to max light level before I buy the annual pass for the black armory. I think it's also a thing where, some people don't want to spend the same amount of hours doing the same thing with 2 other characters. For me, on my first character I took my time on the story and strikes and enjoyed the dialog and immersed myself, but come the second character I just wanted to get through, even more so on my third
---
Unpopular opinion in this sub, right.
---
I have given up on jumping UP with my warlock, it's all downhill from here...ehehehe. But what bothers me alot more is how I always end up dropping my rift in the middle of nowhere when I wanna instantly reload my thunderlord or ikelos shotgun. That shit takes FOREVER.
---
Yuuuuup 1 in the first and 4 in the second. I have to thank my teammates really heavily for two of the four kills. They basically got them super weak and I just delivered a nicely timed headshot. It also helps that this was early after forsaken dropped, cause I had off that week so I was grinding really heavily and everyone was still experimenting with how to play gambit so you didn't see the the ridiculous Sleeper or the "standard" load out. A lot of Invaders were using supers and basic weapons.    
---
I never played D1... but when I look at screenshots and vids showing how cool items looked back then I have my doubts about the quality of D2.
---
Depends on if you want distance (top) or safety (bottom)
---
Yep. Finished all my exotics about 3 weeks ago. Now I only do the Forge, Gambit and Raid for fun. It's soo good being able to skip milestones because there's no reason to do it anymore.
---
Way more enjoyable experience than having to wait to damage a boss that has fuckall health. D2 strike mechanics = unnecessary immune stages.
---
Yeah I know what you mean about once you accomplish what you wanted the game does get stale. I'm on that path also atm, but with the forge I can craft weapons I need ATM. 
---
We never make mistakes. Just happy accidents. - Bob Ross the titan painter.
---
I don't see it. how mm effects you in anyways possible if you won't use it anyways?
---
Is say content wise Destiny 2 is better, but fundamentally and mechanically D1 was better
---
I got the tempest to drop again yesterday in crucible and geomags last week. Those things work so well against boss fights. I hope you get that to drop.
---
Mad warlock;)
---
Yeah I get most of my drops in the dreaming city try there. The blind well. 
---
I got Destiny 1 after Destiny 2, and the first game has a charm to it.  It was amazing.  Screaming when I got my first exotic, the last word, from my first prison of elders clear.  Or that icebreaker I got from my first nightfall.  The title screen was also amazing.  
---
So how many drops have you gotten these pass weeks?
---
The skill trees were better in D1. Could mix and match to your preferred playstyle. Now we just choose 1 out of 3 for each class
---
Super Mario Brothers 2 had Bob-ombs, and there has to be some 80's arcade game that had bombs as enemies that I'm forgetting.
---
Even in the world of first person shooters, I remember that Gears of War had exploding enemies long before Minecraft, and Serious Sam had them before Gears.  I'm sure they showed up earlier than those games though.
---
There are really just a set number of enemy archetypes that almost every enemy in every FPS fit into.  Guys that approach you and (do something detrimental) are one of those archetypes.
---
It's very rare, but I killed two guys with pocket nova in very short range. But maybe it was teamshooted before.
---
Maybe we can find answer how much damage does pocket nova exactly in pvp.
---
You‚Äôre now on ‚ÄúThe List‚Äù. 
---
Damn. It seems like to me I get drops quickly from defeating bosses and mini bosses (yellow bars) I mainly get my drops from the Dreaming City.
---
Tempest is great but yeah those geomags look really good. 
---
ohgodohgod
---
I HAVENT COMPLETED LAST WISH
---
1k voices yo mine. My brotha god it from the first time, he's a lucky son of a bitch
---
I did it first try solo xD
---
You are aware that you can use guided games or LFG sites right?
---
Naisu
---
honestly everybody has own oppinions but d2 is like really trash now. i only liked the start but even that was boring. forsaken had few things but the thing about weekly changing the dream city was bs cuz boring to wait. d1 still fun sometimes and pvp not broken
---
Disagree with d2 being better than d1 reasons why 
---
D1 catered to a larger player base pvp,group,pve, solo, raiders even just people who wanted to take photos 
---
D2 on the other hand caters to groups, raiders, pvp, pve and artists. Solo players are tolerated but second class to everyone else
---
Guns. Far fewer reskins in d1 but still a good variety (exotic felt exotic) plus raid weapons had some cool perks
---
Strikes d1 strikes were far more and better overall
---
Raids i would say they are equal as d2 raids are probably better more variety in different styles in d1
---
Pve d2 probably is better for standard pve but far less enemy variety but that seem to be changing
---
Pvp undecided d2 pvp just feels boring as you are constantly getting steam rolled by supers d1 had same issue but you could at least beat then if you were skilled or lucky
---
Classes d1 had more defined rolls but the mix and match made the classes far more fun d2 better classes but less customizable means less fun
---
Loot dont know where to get started d2 loot is just bad in so many ways d1 was bad but not half as bad as d2 2 blues and a token should say everything 
---
Story well d1 didnt really have to much of a story in the game so d2 wins by default
---
Lore d1 wins hands down even if lore was technically not in the game
---
Characters nice to see fushed out characters in d2 but they really screwed up with some brother vance!
---
Overall experience d1 far better didnt have half the stuff to do but was far more enjoyable and didnt feel dull and dead even after killing the same boss 3000th time didnt want to put it down 
---
 But to be honest this point is mute d2 should never had to prove it wad better than d1 as d1 was a broken mess d2 never should have been and instead of coming out and saying they screwed up they tried to hide it and slipped in shady business practices and predatory microtransactions and have only made it worse so no d2 is not as good as d1and doubt it will be for most of the community and if it is it will be when d3 is released
---
I just continually buy raid banners
---
I do this too but nobody ever takes me up on the offer....I see randos all the time enter into the rift solo
---
Newbie question: If I buy the anual pass after this season will I be able to enjoy Black Forge and all it's content?
---
That's your go-to, huh?
---
I recently got queenbreaker, Last week Le Monarque and I think I may have gotten another "double" exotic too but I'm not keeping exact score. So I'd say perhaps 3 in the last 2 weeks? 
---
Everything that makes it worth playing? Don't forget about so many clanmates who just stopped after D2 had its okay release
---
A good roll, but you should charge your phone XD
---
I do this and it wrecks Thunderlord users.
---
Oh I fucking love it mate!
---
How can you run so fast?
---
Zhalo Supercell and my armor is still the main reason I like D1 a little better.
---
oh dude, xD.  
---
" He's a good guy, the kind of guy I'd hope would find their way to my sister....and If I had to some up what he's meant to me and our family...I'd just say whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.

---
I know! I just happened to notice it in passing. What do you think?
---
Can we get this shit banned, its so damn annoying.
---
You wait for rng Lol have fun.
---
PC
---
I used Waking Vigil (Dreaming City hand cannon) to do it, pretty reliable, would recommend.
---
I‚Äôve gotten two, one was in a 4-stack of me, a friend and a couple of his friends in Crucible Labs so it didn‚Äôt *really* count. The other though was in solo quickplay, using a *sniper and a Halfdan*. Pretty proud of that one
---
Had this happen to me last night on PS4. I still got the chest and whatnot, but I was confused.
---
Well I can‚Äôt speak for you and your schedule, but when I have two hours to play a game, I‚Äôm not thrilled with spending 30 minutes traveling and talking to NPC‚Äôs.
---
Maybe you‚Äôve never played D2, and you don‚Äôt understand that going from planet to planet, or activity to activity takes like one to two minutes of load/‚Äútravel‚Äù time each way.  Those things add up to unnecessary quantities when you‚Äôre constantly going back to Ada so she can examine the checklist you‚Äôve completed.
---
But whatever dude, sounds like you‚Äôve got plenty of time to enjoy it all.  Count yourself lucky I guess 
---
r/sharditkeepit
---
Its not too bad, depending on the masterwork. I wouldnt use flared magwell tho.
---
Not fair!!
---
Lord Shaxx works in mysterious ways...
---
Only thing that is still subpar in destiny 2 is the armor and ornament designs imo.
---
But apart from that, you are right! 
---
I wont give you better, but I will give close to on par.
---
The D2 playerbase is small compared to consoles, even measured individually. Would be a very low playerbase for D1.
---
It was a timed exotic quest, it‚Äôs in the loot pool now. It‚Äôs just like Horror Story was time fates and you can‚Äôt get it anymore. 
---
Eh to each thier own I guess. Have a good day now, bye!
---
Age of Triumphs was the best time to play Destiny imo. Plenty of things to do, the armor was superior in all ways to D2 armor, and the player could play their way to progress. 
---
I cant see through a 100 dollar game thats worth 50 at its best 
---
How would it do in pvp?
---
D2 technically does have more content and try to keep players engaged but in my opinion it will never be better than D1.  A big part of Destiny is its raids and the raids and raid lairs in D2 will never stack up to the raids in D1.  Not to mention D1 had raid exclusive weapons that people actually liked using a lot and armor that had special perks for each raid.  D2 needs to get back that raid magic that made D1 so addicting even though it lacked content.  That‚Äôs the main reason why I don‚Äôt play D2 as much is because I don‚Äôt like the raids or raid lairs much.  I think Eater of Worlds was awesome.  But yeah lol.  
---
And I'm going to get a warning or ban if I quit! 
---
Lol, true. But I still might pre-order it. It's got me interested enough. 
---
Thats your prefrence of playing really. Its a compound bow, so it has naturally higher draw time than for example a arsenic bite, but your rolls are pretty solid. Just give it a go. :) 
---
This is what really drove me away from D2 as a casual solo player.
---
I‚Äôm interested and worried.  I‚Äôm done pre ordering games, even the ones I love.
---
you should check out insurmountable skullfort lore 
---
Yes 
---
Not sure, but you should definitely post this on r/raidsecrets as well. They are great at decrypting D2's secrets over there.
---
How long did it take you?
---
Thanks.
---
May RNGesus be on your side
---
Thunderlord is now a random drop
---
You too
---
That's correct, I've seen several people receive it as a random drop since the quest went away.
---
Thanks. I'll need him today :D
---
You have to do the story to unlock the rest, but do it with friends and put on fireteam medallions, they stack up to 3 times. Youll be done before you know it.
---
Overall I agree d2 is better... d1 was something mindless I could catch up with friends over... d2 is something mindless that I look forward to when I get home.... only less than are skill tree and time until raid with vanilla d2. Just recently bought all dlc and am high enough level but don't have a team to do it with. 
---
I‚Äôm one of those people that really enjoyed VoG and Crota. pre-taken king had the best raid gear/weapons in my opinion.
---
asking if I should grind more. Am a noob, so maybe its shit, lol. 
---
I do not think anyone argues whether Diablo 2 is better than Diablo.  Diablo 2 is clearly the flagship game of the series. 
---
Also I am confused why this post is talking about Destiny (?) 
---
I agree
---
Because human are scum, and earth is a wasteland.
---
I have to agree. I feel like this is the best Destiny has ever been, even better than with Taken King. I do still kind of miss some of my armor, though. The raid ornaments they released just before D2 were fantastic (I'm lookin' at you, Crota armor).
---
Just play the game 
---
üòÇ 
---
Holy shit yes. There is no situation EVER where I want to hover downwards so I can just barely miss that ledge. 
---
crucible matches give the most XP, if thats the kind of leveling you are talking about. 1-50?
---
My first intro to Destiny was D2 on PC when it launched, but just bought a copy of D1 each for my wife and me over Christmas. After getting through the majority of the game I 100% agree... used to think people were just being whiney but there's definitely a huge difference.
---
D1 seems to favor more of the Sci-fi look and feel, where D2 went full steam to Fantasy with the classes. D2 gameplay feels a lot more polished (although probably just my impression of PC vs console), but missing a lot of the cool RPG aspects of D1 like the progressive unlocks for weapons/armor. Subclass options still need a lot of work, but are much improved as well. QoL overall is getting better and better.
---
Don‚Äôt forget to make the music as loud as possible. üëå
---
Black hammer
---
Happened to me last night too.
---
Base Leviathan is great as long as you skip castellum through underbelly. Castellum completely ruins the pacing of the raid after you‚Äôve done it more than once.
---
Yeah, regardless of how hard they try to balance PvP the hardcore guys will always find what's best and it trickles down through the PvP community
---
did you crop this with a chainsaw?
---
Like the rest of the encounter you get used to it. a group of 3 people cleared the whole encounter in 5 minutes so there is definitely time to spare.
---
I just want m Zhalo back.
---
Yesh :D
---
I'll add you when I get home.  I appreciate it! I am level 31 now and through the main campaign starting Oryx.  
---
Yes they are is I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm only 10 
---
Then the puzzle begins
---
you can find those letters on the 3 pillars next to the three screen in the middle. Look in the scope of hammerhead.
---
I‚Äôm down there with you
---
Yeah, I got it last week.
---
I think d2 is good, but lore-wise they lost the ball.
---
Imo there happened just too much in d2 to keep it all together.
---
I mean, i like all the stuff Forsaken brought to the game. But on the other hand, why so many loose ends ? 
---
I mean we have a Awoken City now, Scorn, the Drifter, Armory....
---
I just hope the dont waste the Hive and Savathun like they did with the Vex.
---
Is that an app?
---
Oh shit I forgot about that... I don't have it yet I should get on that.
---
Sup ma dude
---
Can't count how many times I've rushed the primeval, popped super, only to get kicked through the portal. :p
---
I wanted to cry getting those kills took so long
---
That is so titan of you.
---
I think the sad part is just the fact that the word "now" is included in this. Like it took a full year of D2 being out for it to be as good/better than D1. 
---
Or not registered at all
---
Remember to write "they *am* are is" next time.
---
I disagree but to be honest I don‚Äôt know why, I like D2 but I just don‚Äôt get drawn back in to play as I did D1
---
More of this 
---
From those letters can be put together "Destiny faul".
---
Oh wait...
---
Wishbringer
---
It is 6am for some people when reset happens.
---
Was it better in d1? Like I love pvp in general but d2 crucible is shit.
---
I miss the weapon progressions so so so much. Getting that weapon and seeing the perks you were going to unlock by using it, and then having to level the weapon to get those perks was so satisfying. Totally agree that this should return to weapons in Destiny 2. 
---
I got one last night with feeding frenzy and mulligan. Then I got a killclip/outlaw blast furnace on my next forge. RNG has never been this kind to me in this game.
---
I'M ALREADY TRACER
---
Second to last step of the Izanami forge unlock quest
---
The curse week cycle is a 3 week cycle. The level of Taken corruption on the dreaming city increases with each week before resetting back to week 1. The story mission and where Petra change with each week. 
---
The Shattered Throne is only available on week 3. 
---
It‚Äôs 2019 get with the times, everything is nostalgic.
---
This applies to Diablo 2, the original "D2".
---
Same here, got it from an engram in the leviathan. Also with my warlock. 
---
I'm on PS4 so I just hit the share button and it saves the last 15mns of gameplay
---
&gt;Weapon and armor perks should be earned through use of those items (kills, XP, etc)
---
Couldn't agree more!
---
It would've been nice if he'd asked you, but yeah, that's something that a lot of people will see as being helpful. I had a hell of a time figuring out the story too because I played with people who were way ahead of me and rushed through; it took me a while to realize I could just say, "Hey, I actually haven't played the story yet, can we slow it down a bit?" Fortunately, most people seem pretty accommodating on that. 
---
So I've found symbols while aiming through Tatara Gaze. Looks like a Pagoda, a rabbit, a Japanese style pillar, and a lotus. Any ideas?
---
Can't thank you enough
---
Have you done the quest on all 3 characters? Could just get the meatball to spawn on one of your alts
---
got that in Gambit once! I play solo and just try my best to be a good team player in all aspects.. I'll get a party up request and be like, "at least I know I'm not a terrible blueberry" haha
---
Yeah, that's super nice...I'd never get 1000 sniper kills lol just from last night after I got the sniper, having it equipped, not really using it...doing EP I am already at 750 kills lol 
---
If we cant stop seeing ada everytime. Let me hold more than one frame type at a time. Let me grind out the steps. Then one ada visit for all 3 frames. I'd take this even if you have to forge one weapon per forge clear. Hell I'd expect that you can only "forge" one weapon per completion. 
---
PREACH!
---
Hell if  your on xbone hmu and I'll que you into it and leave , I have it ready to go on my hunter lol
---
Good grief 
---
Coming from a Hunter: Warlock with 24 hours of play time, still not used to the jumping mechanics. Do the whisper mission, proceed to lose my mind. Get it done on the 5th try with 4 mins left on the clock to shred the bosses with my teammates. I was on the edge of my seat. That sigh of relief when the sniper popped up on my screen. I almost cried from frustration and satisfaction. What a rollercoaster that was. 
---
All capitals? Questionably douchey.
---
Every game gets boring and repetitive if you play it enough. 
---
Fireteam and somebody who's really good at invading had that step done for me in like 2 and half games.
---
Oh so that explains the whole Uldren thing going on. (Trying to avoid spoilers)
---
D1 pvp maps were way better than d2. D2 maps are uninspired af
---
Private matches don‚Äôt count!? Did not know that! Thanks. I wish I had more hand cannons in my arsenal. 
---
I can't stress enough that I'm fucking terrible at PVP. I knocked it out in maybe 6-7 matches of Rumble using a Crimson and a Trust (as my emergency backup).
---
The AFK fucks in Rumble are my heroes. I got probably half of the kills from them.
---
Looks like you might be right and wrong at the same time?

FYI one of the nightfalls this week is the Corrupted, so go get that Cursebreaker Guardian!
---
D2 is much better, I just had more fun in D1 because it was new
---
Crimson is a good bet (what I used), but a good Trust or Duke can be handy.

Probably hunter, because I prefer to avoid frontal conflict. I usually play games defensively and try to stack the odds in my favour before the battle even begins, so that I can win quickly before they can react. If it fails, then I turn to tedious hide and seek so they can't get a good shot in. 
---
I did this once on accident... We were Roflstomping the other team and I forgot to deposit.  Didn't die during the invade either.  I said this in a previous comment on a similar post...  There should be a triumph...  "You dumb Bitch"

If you want communication you have to create your own group and even then most want to use a third party program like Discord because the in-game voice chat is subpar.

Nice spoilers bro
---
Yeah. I don't have Black Talon nore the Talons of the Eagle, but I have a God-Roll Bygones and Vestian Dynasty. I used them in Comp and I got a triple in Countdown, no help, they just all came at me one-by-one!

That makes sense. Is there a discord for crucible where people group up?

So when you say AFK, you‚Äôre referring to players who have paused their game while they‚Äôre in the middle of a match for whatever reason, and they just end up sitting there ‚Äústationary‚Äù which makes for an easy target? 
---
do you know if there streaming it?
---
Yeah, most of the AFK players were just standing there for me. On occasion, I'd also see players running macros to keep them moving (like in a small circle).
---
The ones standing motionless made it ridiculously easy to get precision kills.
---
Uuuummmm suicide grunts much

Loved this game...for a bit. All that good grace went right down the shitter when I was told I had to repurchase ALL the dlc once I got a PS4. All the light levels earned, guns, and armor were still on my ps4 profile...cant equip or use any of it...cuz I got the dlc for ps3 NOT ps4. Still have active quests that I cant actually do bc: hey, gotta buy the dlc for the PS4 too!!!  Fuck you destiny! There is MY unpopular opinion on this crooked-ass game. 
---
I envy you. I have had meatball twice and both times I was unable to kill it.
---
Welp this is just wrong 
---
I thought this post was about D2: The Mighty Ducks (It is better than the first movie). I instantly feel old.
---
I play several games on multiple systems. Destiny 2 is my biggest contributor however I had almost 0 problems getting to 650 on 3 characters. My son who is only here weekends got his 2 to 650. And my brother who didnt even get back in after taking a hiatus till BA dropped is sitting at 647 with maybe an hour or 2 TOPS per night. And some days not any at all. 
---
Grinding efficiently isnt laborious. However grinding randomly is. I can go from 0 cores to almost 10 in literally no time at all. And have almost all the drops legendary and exotic wise one can have. 
---
Sure looking like a hobo for a bit sucks. But its ALWAYS been part of how getting to the next plateau is. Though I mostly kept stuff and infused along the way. So it kept it simple. I understand expressing your feelings about something. But saying "it's too grindy " after the massive amounts of complaints about almost no grinding, is not going to help the community get a "better end game". It simply tells them that people wont be satisfied even when they are given what they want. 
---
We offer as a community so many problems. And you being in the industry like you said, should above all be speaking about ways to improve it, and maybe evolve it to a better state. Not complaining about what you dislike (that others may like just fine) and why you're leaving a community and game you proclaim to love and adore. 
---
I cant offer perfect solutions. I also dont write books about my departure from something I'm infatuated with. I do however offer help with any and all activites. In an effort to keep the players that may struggle or know less engaged and enjoying the game so the community can grow stronger and more resilient to the bad times. 
---
Perhaps your next piece should be more positive and forward looking. Instead of negative and whiny. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Thanks!
---
Although  I just read bungie's twitter and apparently only 1 fireteam needs to solve it and its unlocked for everyone lol.
---
So gonna grab some popcorn, and wait, lmao.
---
Correct 
---
\*Laughs in RD:R2\*
---
Dont forget the fact that factions wasnt behind a pointless timed event (faction rallies tarnished fwc, do and nm factions) 
---
Need to do milestones. I.e. The Nightfall, Nightfall 100k, daily strike, daily crucible, daily gambit - these all give "powerful" engrams to increase light level. 
---
Look for the Yellow Circle-y symbols in the "Destinations" Screen. Also any Vendor with a light blue shield/badge emblem has a task for you to do to get powerful engram drop.
---
(I'm not sure if this is only for 600+ PL, but I'm assuming that's the go)
---
I‚Äôm going to throw my ghost at you
---
You can kill a Titan 
---
Early January checkin. Any progress?
---
It's not perfect, but I'm about 50/50 right now for my kills being headshots. Really making progress on this step. Not looking forward to the grind for fabled though
---
Thanks for this great link 
---
You're right, getting up to 650 isn't that hard. I just don't want to do it while looking ass, not playing the guns I love. Period.
---
I didn't mention way to improve it because the solution is so obvious. Bring back the old infusion system. Or at least, make infusion easy again. There's many stuff to care and mind about in Destiny. Infusion shouldn't be part of that. 
---
Ahh, the weekly ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna wait until I have the enhancements cores to upgrade my favorite pieces‚Äù post. Kay, moving on lol. 
---
Spider sells them for shards
---
Bounties from spider reward them
---
Scrapper bounties now reward cores
---
I'm around 300 and ran into a four stack all running dust rocks and not forgottens. Fucking awful.  
---
there's only one event...
---
D12 is better than both
---
I bet he can hold that camera on target for a long ass time though. You laugh, but that is the optimal form of Hand-Canon.
---
It's either the last word or izanagi's burden, they're both kinetic which is surprising that there's only 1 slot there. And why is Le Monarque there if it's void?
---
The description for the gun is ‚Äúhold on til‚Äô midnight.‚Äù as well. Gave me a chuckle once I got the thing
---
I will throw my ghost at her 
---
ehhh both games have equal legends and equal flaws. 
---
You really don't lol
---
If you have Forsaken you should be getting upgrades all the time anywhere up until level 500, then you will need to go for quests that give powerful gear.
---
I do think largely D2 is better than D1 except regarding PvP, D2 PvP right now doesn't hold a candle to D1 PvP for the first two years.
---
Thank you Sherlock, much appreciated, I hadn't thought about it. ;) 
---
* insert suprised pikachu *
---
Naw man it‚Äôs a Scorn dreg, the Mindbender‚Äôs contribution is using the rituals the Hive use to turn thrall into ogres. 
---
There's one event, but two versions. One where you fight 4 Cyclops and one where you fight 4 hydra 
---
This is something I miss from my overwatch days- after just about any game there‚Äôd be a round of gg‚Äôs, but in destiny you don‚Äôt see that. Definitely feel like destiny is a lot less toxic, but I do miss the sportsmanship aspect of OW
---
More like: Bungie burnt too many bridges and people aren't willing to try and cross that line again.
---
Infusing to some degree has always existed. Cant remove a staple of the game. 
---
My brother still right now rocks his Ghost Primus. People dont look dope while they come up  once they reach the top, is when they get to be fly. Getting there can be very ugly, and hard on whatever to the point where they may look like they are struggling but really are doing what they need to so they can enjoy the end goal more. 
---
Almost all Y1 guns are still viable because they can be taken to 650. My Y1 Better Devils prime example. Literally used it until 15 drops later shaxx me one I now adore far far more. 
---
Many if the new weapons and even older weapons (forsaken back) are amazing. Not sure which of the new you've tried. But I have a literal arsenal of stuff with rolls I enjoy to play with. And usually have a good time. Smgs. Hand cannons. Pulse rifles. Auto rifles. You name it, I have more than a few of each I keep on deck for my 3 toons. 
---
The solution isnt just "change it back" 
---
Infusing ONLY the gun type your infusing to go up? I rather enjoy ditching a 650 shit drop SMG into a another weapon like sniper I may love more. It was literally infuriating and maddening waiting for the RIGHT weapon type and high light level on it to drop for infusion purposes. 
---
Wrong meme format, you were supposed to use car salesman meme format
---
Id rather have had content I can play myself rather than have to rely  on effing streamers
---
Screebs were Fallen once too. They‚Äôve just been resurrected too many times by the Fanatic and the corrupted ether has bloated and twisted them into this form.
---
I honestly wish people got on their mics though. I remember my hao days I would chat with random groups all the time. Yeh the destiny community is great, but It would be cool to have those random chats again.
---
I thought about diablo.
---
I wish more shaders showed of that beautiful wood on the handle and grip.
---
Yeah. I got ahold of the guy that drew it. Can't wait
---
Ummm thats a forge? I thought bergusia was the name of the last forge... 
---
All you did was a part of a puzzle, i think. :)
---
My first and last time speaking to my team on mic:
---
Me- ‚ÄúI injured a hunter, he‚Äôs right by you Blue. Light him u-‚Äú
---
Blue- ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM GONNA SAY THE ‚ÄòN‚Äô WORD!!!‚Äù
---
You get to nap at work? 
---
if you do it that way theres 3 versions, you can also get 4 minotaur.
---
More like distant relation scout
---
Yessssssssssss
---
Funnily enough, Mike Mearls‚Äô inspiration for the Celestial Pact was the Sunsinger from Destiny 1.
---
Thought this was in reference to Diablo 
---
It really do be like that
---
Keep at it man. I was doing the two frames per character per week and finally got it last reset. It is super disheartening, especially when you play with fandoms and they get it. Hope you get it soon, bud. 
---
I concur no probs, just maybe have a more pessimistic view. I‚Äôm 95% sure you are light years above me in PvP so I agree you are technically correct and good enough to appreciate the difference (which maybe I‚Äôm not). 
---
On a personal level I‚Äôd like to see a meta where different play styles are more variable however I‚Äôm not everyone and I‚Äôm obviously not top tier.
---
On the plus side I thought PvP in this game was dying so it‚Äôs nice to see a healthy discussion. 
---
...after they get home from work.
---
Oh I forgot about that one.
---
My point is there would easily be a 2nd public event involving the cabal since there's loads around 
---
How do you "commit to the exotic grind"?
---
From what I‚Äôm understanding, this puzzle will unlock the new forge for everyone. Once the streamers figure it out, I‚Äôd be surprised if these puzzles/encounters stuck around, but, I‚Äôve been wrong plenty of times before. üòÇ
---
Thanks dude. I almost contemplated deleting a character and leveling it up to get another 2 forge attempts lol. yeah... that's too much work
---
Than quit complaining about fashion 
---
Thanks ! My joke needs to rest now.
---
I fucking read D12 and D11 and was thinking wtf is D11 and then I saw it's D2 and D1
---
Is that on console? I haven‚Äôt really come up against that many Toleato users on PC.
---
I feel like I‚Äôve been killed by 1000 voices way more times and that‚Äôs much harder to get.
---
only weaklings go to sleep, I'm watching that shit even if I'm EU
---
But try shooting A phalanx with A shotty when theres 3-4 at the same time. You WILL get punted across the map
---
this is exactly right
---
I disagree. The only reason D2 is getting better is because they are making more like D1 now.
---
It honestly felt like the D2 game design at the start to not use anything D1 unless they had to. And all the things they'd learnt and perfected for 3 years got tossed aside.
---
D1 felt better gun wise, to me at least. I remember when they would make big weapon tuning patches across the board and thing felt better and new weapons would be useful, but old ones were still good. I loved ace of spades in D1, but don't like it in D2. I also hate the aim assit BS on console. Ever have your target insight and your about to squeeze off the perfect shot, but something crosses the screen and your gun leaps to the left? Yeah, I hate that too. 
---
I just don't find D2 fun or engaging at all. I try to want to, but it's not fun for me. It's not rewarding. 'glad we made that heroic so we'd get 400 glimmer instead of... Nothing?' it's not rewarding. 
---
My biggest grip of all is Amanda holiday, you know the ship and speeder lady, who played a crucial role in the story, and basically has one job, to sell ships and speeders, doesn't. You have to go to the cash shop for that. She had one job guys! Now the cash shop nobody sells me ships... 
---
I wanted and I tried, but it's just not as fun for me personally. A lot of people like the new set up and goings on. And I'm genuinely happy for you all. But I just can't do it. I play with my dad and it's so hard to disappoint him by not being excited to play at all. 
---
Fastest hand in the solar system. There‚Äôs A hive worm in my boot!!
---
The QoL changes make it a more polished game but 
---
the garbage map design, 
---
Lack of crucible balance, 
---
lack of variety, 
---
Uninteresting enemies, 
---
no subclass customization, 
---
lack of incentive to do patrols and public events, 
---
sparrows being made of glass, time gated content, 
---
tiny amount of legendary weapons, 
---
and hideous armor design 
---
hold the game back from being better than destiny 1
---
True, but if that's the case, then our Guardian (Who killed Uldren) would become the Vanguard? Which would mean AoS is rightfully ours.
---
Well, maybe not a straight up mercy rule like quickplay, but a voting system where if all the player in your team voted to yeid, you can forfeit the fight.
