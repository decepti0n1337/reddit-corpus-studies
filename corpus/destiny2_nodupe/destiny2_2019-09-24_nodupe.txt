This site lets you see recorded clips or streams of games you were in. Its kind of fun to hear what people say mid stream if you were get a crispy snipe or a good play.
---
Mod I was not lfg I was suggesting some one go to the lfg sites for that
---
Taken Captains can defy the laws of the game. No enemy should be able to teleport everytime I ADS at them. So this doesn‚Äôt even surprise me lol you‚Äôre lucky he even came down

What is this?

Where's Tether? *Sad Nightstalkers noises*
---
Are here i am struggling to *jump* onto anything. Take my upvote.
---
Those diabolical sons of bitches!
---
I think my internet is shit because there‚Äôs no way blade barrage should leave anyone standing as often as it does for me.
---
It doesn't hurt to have the extra handling. It also helps for midair shots
---
And not having snapshot on a mindbenders with full choke isn't a deal breaker. Most people consider quickdraw slideshot just as good if not better. Yes, snapshot is beneficial, and so is rampage. It all depends on what the player farming plays more. Rampage comes into play a lot more in quickplay and iron banner than comp. And in most situations I hardly find people running shotguns without quickdraw in high comp. So when refering to dust rock and imperial i consider those more quickplay shotguns. Especially with the nf and luna's nerf comp is literally ace, spare rations, and then a good mindbenders or retold with quickdraw or good handling perks. I didn't call them the god roll, I called them good rolls. And they are good rolls.
---
The whole erentil thing is completely based on how you play. If you want to sit crouched with a fusion and spam it the whole game then get a max range one, if you play like I do when you use a fusion, which isn't a lot because I'm not a scumbag, then you use it as a secondary. Not a primary. When using erentil as a secondary weapon backup plan is pretty much necessary. So, TLDR - If you want to main your fusion, get a max range one, if you want it as a secondary to use as a backup and counter to apes, then get a backup plan roll. It isn't meant to go far.
---
I said I was on pc because as the TITLE says, here are some things I've farmed for, I haven't farmed for a pvp trust, because they aren't good on pc. These are some things I personally have gotten that work well.
---
And yes the curated roll is obviously more useful. That's why I said if you have the curated roll don't worry about it. That is for myself and anyone else that has over 2,000 hours and does forsaken stuff every week but has yet to get the curated roll. No I'm not salty I'm just depressed. You can really pair anything on twilight oath with opening shot and it'll be good, but box breathing is the only perk in that column that provides any benefit to the shot unless you proc kill clip. So I chose that perk. As stated, obviously if you have the curated roll use that.
---
Even better if it's golden gun vs golden gun

but here‚Äôs the thing, empowering rift gave range... and that range was devastating for our enemies

Well classic is bring back a lot of players

That poor guy rounding the corner thinking your super was gonna run out... so sad...
---
Yeah ok, *Shadow of Earth*...
---
Underrated comment
---
yeah, for the people who still think a buggy game from 2003 is good. /s
---
anyway  you're technically right, but it's not gonna be good enough to compete against every other mmo that's popular right now.
---
Leaked full black shader
---
You have to admit though, it is kind of a broken combo, being able to melt bosses in absolute seconds, just like the toaster bug, it‚Äôs great when they happen but they‚Äôre not exactly healthy for the game in the long term. I do appreciate when youtubers and streamers raise awareness to these things, because 1.) it exposes things that a lot of people would never discover allowing for people to try it themselves 2.) it prevents the uniformed from falling victim to cheap tactics in I dunno, maybe Gambit, And 3.) people won‚Äôt ask questions when a combo is eventually nerfed because only 1% of the population ever even knew about it. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying that I hate this combo, all I‚Äôm saying is that having this shotgun and build makes a lot of other weapons redundant. Being able to melt things in seconds, although fun when it happens, gets old fast when you can do it over and over again, with ease.
---
At least we got to enjoy it when it happened.
---
How long does it take to get a pin by the way? I preordered the MMXIX seal
---
Yeah man screw who ever thought the medals idea up. I will say that once I switched strategies getting the % worked out way better for me in the end.
---
Basically forget about getting motes and just kill. While I usually had the lowest motes banked I was usually 30+ kills more than any of my other teammates. Plus we won most of the matches, as I was able to kill the enemy while the teammates picked up motes and I was able to pick off invading guardians pretty quick with the bow. Except for snipers and thunderlord... Thunderlord is a damn sniping machine gun... Lol
---
No
---
All of the "buffs" are a bit backhanded as well considering precision damage is being halved. The 10-30% buffs aren't doing a whole lot to compensate.
---
Me either dude, whisper mission was a nightmare for me
---
Lmaooo, but also think of the ones who spawned just to get hit by a Captain America shield from around the corner ü§£
---
I am light 750 i play on ps4 and eastern time zone im trying to do the shattered throne for the exotic bow and i need help completing it because its not working for me doing it solo i made it to the boss but i need to defeat it and do the orb quest to spawn all the bosses to get my tokens done any help would be greatly appreciated psn name is AngelofDeath0821 thank you for looking at my post and have a great night
---
I ended up with smallbore, accurized, slideshot, graverobber and range MW
---
Got no luck finding decent rolls after that so I gave up and instead use chaperone üòÜ

So many careers cheesed... never forget.

The app description says the DualShock doesn‚Äôt work with it, but I‚Äôve seen people using it to play. So does it work or not
---
He is the sweeper bot prior to Calus hacking it

According to App description, the DualShock doesn‚Äôt work with the remote play app

##enemy spotted
---
They are also getting rid of the double damage to minor enemies so the buff is to majors
---
That's fine that you disagree. I mean just look at it this way, through most of destiny's life cycle in pvp, both d1 and d2, hand cannons have always been either the meta or a part of the meta. Even now in d2, they are the only primary weapons used in tourneys and there are teams running nothing but spare rations in QP. Obviously there will always be a meta in pvp, and people will gravitate towards what is most effective but that does not mean other options could be made more viable.
---
Ah NVM. Me and my gf play on PS4 she wants more girls to play with. She only got one right now. Good luck!
---
True but nostalgia is a powerful thing and will probably help a lot with player count
---
Have you started trying to learn Japanese yet?
---
Thanks yo! I was hoping for images of guardians in the full sets, but this is still a neat site!
---
I play on PC from the couch on a 65‚Äù Oled with controller. Best of both worlds.
---
Just an FYI, if you get a 2 win streak, you can leave, go to orbit and click back on iron banner. When it says 1/12, cancel matchmaking and you will progress. Normally I feel bad cheesing but after grinding all 3 sets myself, I was justified.
---
Instead of saving the period till the end, maybe pepper a few throughout the post.
---
Also Bungie's already announced changes to matchmaking, you can find them a TWAB or two back.
---
Might brave talk for someone within dreadnaught blast radius
---
I know what you‚Äôre saying but i think the viabillity of something is more down to the skill level of the user. If you have insane tracking that automatically opens up another weapon type to you, e.g smgs and trace rifles. Simillar to how people complain about the shotgun meta, using a sniper will be seen as essentially throwing unless you possess the aim and gamesense to use one. I agree hand cannons are really common but the only weapon type i honestly see needing buffs are scouts because they literally dont have ‚Äúviable‚Äù time to kill‚Äù. Even with a good player using them, they flat out dont hit hard enough to warrant being used over something like a hand cannon.
---
Awesome, you gotta continue the story
---
I have been using Moonlight for a while now. Great streaming app. But I can only stream through mobile data while at school and sometimes there are connection drops
---
iOS 13 saves the day
---
3 games without progress?? Damn I go full on days sometimes without a DK.
---
My favorite crucible titan build right now is peackeepers + recluse and 8 mobility for this very play style
---
I‚Äôm hooked, I love pieces like this where it picks up in a familiar spot and time but it‚Äôs a unique story, super creative, let me know if you write any more!
---
And got sniped
---
This is great!
---
Its worth it, but does take forever as the other reply mentions, hammerhead,blast furnace, the exotic sniper, jotunn aka toaster are all worth it but its a bit of a time sink to unlock them all.  Depending on where youre at as far as unlocks it might take until after shadowkeep launches to unlock them all
---
Much agreed. I now understand ‚Äúwhy‚Äù they aren‚Äôt according to the game and lore but I wish a different route was taken.
---
Go pantherssssss I recognized that lanyard
---
Not an instant win exotic, but it still needs to be toned down a little imo. I like the idea of every class having some ability to track (Foetracer/Spectral, Sanguine Alchemy, OEM). But I think the damage boost at this point may as well not exist, and the overshield is and always was what made it OP. Giving you the opportunity for ~300 health instead of ~200 guarantees you win any reasonable gunfight when the overshield is active.
---
And requiring you to take damage to track an enemy is a risky playstyle, so you would still get a heal after the kill.
---
Pure chance!
---
can you just answer the question lol
---
Completely agree, lore wise it makes perfect sense, gameplay wise it‚Äôs super sad
---
Look 1 I will, two, I just really dislike when people treat quick play like comp and ruin it for the blueberries.
---
I think this comment may have been a little harsh, I‚Äôve got nothing against you, I just don‚Äôt like how sweaty quick play is rn
---
Explain how something with a narrow mouth can eat so much and get so fat?
---
True, but it still helps to land that extra damage in the event your team is competent.
---
"I made this for you" I'd say is the hardest then I'd say 7th column is next. Though for the average player a Ghost is quite hard to get, I not long got my first Ghost as well even after 30 or so Ran outs and 15 or so Annihilations.
---
**calus is revolted**
---
no no no the classes are tank' fast boi and gay not titan hunter and warlock
---
nice!!!  i love when you start to see the improvement you see the game in a different manner
---
So glad I'm not the only one who noticed this.
---
You‚Äôre welcome. Happy guardian slaying my friend
---
Literally just got done using my dualshock on my iphone. It works.
---
Nah, man, it's missing Luck in the Chamber
---
The way your rocket tracked him perfectly was very impressive
---
don't use the level skip right away, you're not allowed to go back to the original three campaigns if you use it. admittedly the forsaken campaign really puts them to shame, but they're worth playing as a beginner.
---
My opinion, just casually play the game. Do the story missions and the strikes. Don‚Äôt dive deep into the grind of it all just yet because you‚Äôll get overwhelmed quick. Learn mechanics and what weapons you enjoy playing with. 
---
Save that level 30 option for a different character you want to try. (Whatever is not your main)
---
Whether you wanted it or not...
---
Only Shattered Throne
---
With 5 other afk players in rumble so ghost is pretty easy
---
Which strike tho
---
Now theres a blast from the past. Countless hours spent on that.
---
Skilled to be sure, but the one eyed mask makes me weary
---
Start hording planetary materials, including weapon Smith material's. 
---
You can do the pinnacles but they aren't going away after shadowkeep as far as I know so you could do them with your friends.
---
The big one for me would be farming for God rolls on weapons I really like. Either through the menagerie or else where.
---
What an ugly piece of shit, surely he must realize how stupid he looks? I mean you‚Äôd think he would yet he‚Äôs got his chin held up high looking completely unamused as if he‚Äôs too good for the camera man. Who in the actual fuck does he think he is? He has 0 reason to be that cocky and needs to be put in his place

If you have a lot of time: https://shadowkeep.destinyrecipes.com

If not: God roll weapons as mentioned

Sure thing, it can be different than i say. I think i read about it somewhere. If the current install will be able to be moved to work with steam praise the lord.

Most of the crucible maps are made with that in mind, though. They all have some sort of close quarters area that revolves around all objectives one way or another.

This "Holding W" meta is honestly the worst. At least you'd have to actually aim with pulse rifles.

When you get the memory reward sword from Mars but u gotta masterwork Polaris Lance. Got both yesterday and this came to mind, because I really like the power swords even if they're off meta.
---
They dont.
---
But lonesome from Prime/Reckoning is also precision frame.
---
There's something in my eye
---
thanks a lot for sharing.
---
any more like it ? :D
---
I've mained warlock since d1, I also dont see the point of having a second character, so I've only used warlock for the last 6 years or so.
---
In IB too so start clicking guardian before reset.
---
That's the only free one I found. Still confused as to why I'm getting downvoted when I'm informing people of a free code

hmmm, that doesn't sound right. As far as I am aware, the pop-up just lets you know the quest is in the game. Try this  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkfmhhGNcUw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkfmhhGNcUw) and see if you can start the Lumina quest that way.

It'll actually be nice once New Light is out for me to do the old raids and finally get that platinum.

---
exotic = izanagi  
---
legendary = long shadow /w field prep, triple tap &amp; appended mag
---
Does this mean new light does not include forsaken or am I being dumb here?
---
And to be honest, the take away from comments/experiences across Reddit, YouTube, friends, etc., is that unless you plan on playing at a competitive and/or professional level, a controller is not going to hamper your experience but in my opinion, it actually allows you to enjoy the game much more with the shackles removed. At the end of the day, this is a hobby and if your not comfortable then we have a problem.
---
I always felt the same way about this gun. It‚Äôs so fun to use. Breakneck with a rampage spec and  Prometheus Lens was my loadout for a while, especially when I was grinding for Dredgen in Gambit.
---
I'll certainly give it a bash, thank you!
---
the passive aggressiveness is palpable
---
I‚Äôm so close to getting the Breakneck, so I‚Äôm pretty hyped
---
If so. You skipped over the original, warmimd, and curse campaign.
---
Reminds me of the time the Drifter offered to do the Janitor‚Äôs work and then left right after they were gone.
---
PC Player here looking for 1-2 dudes for 3 nightfalls with 1 being above 50k pls :)
---
Mayhem start this week so fighting lion and hunter tether is real good for those parts. Otherwise when I got to that point I found it easier to use my play of the game and a normal loadout like shotgun/pulse, the heavy doesn't matter much IMO because people say proxy nades are bad but they still ohko most of the time for me, using colony is a trend but it's not hard to dodge either
---
Its amazing at clearing adds in tight quarters, but it's not going to  burst anything beefy down like a good sniper, shotgun, fusion, etc will.
---
thanks for the heads up
---
Don't mean to be that guy, but you can kill a Titan mid-shoulder charge with a shotgun or pre-charged fusino rifle
---
Timeline: *gets broken*
---
Vex: **i can fix that**
---
tether + orpheus for maximum super up time, fighting lion 1 shots when tether is active anyway.
---
Looks a bit bland.
---
Yeah, otherwise the Scorn would‚Äôve been fighting Cayde 7 as he did kinda die on the way down then get picked up by his Ghost
---
never though I‚Äôd hear e-pro in a destiny trailer
---
I mean I‚Äôm a titan main now (after 4 years of being a hunter main) who only plays pvp and I‚Äôll run OEM, but I‚Äôm a sniper. I don‚Äôt care for this ape nonsense at all
---
problem with this gun is that it uses special ammo, special weapons are generally for outputting big dps to melt majors/bosses. most people don't use special weapons to melt adds even if its fun as hell, since bad luck with ammo drops can really screw you over if you're running double special. there's also the issue where it takes up your exotic slot
---
Oh, give it to the wee lad already
---
You're right, I definitely don't intend on playing competitivey or professionally. For me, the aim of the game is a way to escape and have fun. I guess I'll try out both methods of playing and just follow whichever one of the two feels more natural.
---
Okay I realized what happened, lol but is CoO and warmind worth the play ?
---
Then go visit r/Transmatfiring, you'll like it
---
Nice.
---
Were is omnigule I‚Äôd mate with her üòè lol üòÇ
---
They're alright, less compelling story-wise than Forsaken imo, but more stuff to shoot is always fun and Rasputin is an interesting character. Can always play through them on a new character if you're feeling bored on your main.
---
To be completely honest, I thought I had the guard sword equipped, not the slashy uppercut one...
---
Nice
---
The self damage on blade barrage is so low. You survived all of them?
---
isn't that just the shadow from her hair?
---
If there‚Äôs a 7 someone is cheating the game
---
...? So what? Matchmaking was never skill-based.
---
They‚Äôre all generic roaming add clear.
---
thank you for saying the song name, I was trying to find out where i have heard the tune before
---
So Shadowkeep launches next reset right?
---
I mean if they do that it kinda sucks for the people who actually earned it. that also being said it has a ornimate  system in place for that set so that would be dumb to make it transmog into a 2.0 set.
---
How dare you come in here with your well writen paragraph full of logical answers... MOONS HAUNTED

Yes, there is a big downtime. A friend told me that you can pre-load the extension during the downtime!

I feel like only aggressive snipers should have the capability OHKing Supers
---
Disagree. Imc not going to guitinne the janitor
---
Why did they switch from bnet to steam? Was it a contract thing?
---
It's how it was in D1 tho. You could kill a super with a shotgun+melee too. I'm sure what you will see is a surge of Nova bomb warlocks and bubble Titans (maybe missile Titans too). Hunters have blade barrage and tether but it will be just as easy to kill them too. The meta is shifting and it's going to be quite the change for people who have only been in the game since forsaken but we will adapt. This is healthy for the pvp meta. I'm a little more concerned about pve supers honestly since we will be weaker but the adds will be beefed up. I guess we will just have to wait and see but don't panic yet (:

The new raid is called the Garden of Salvation :)
---
Keep making Shaxx proud, guardian.
---
If you can consistently shoot a dawnblade in the face you deserve those kills. Nova warp should be easy to kill because it‚Äôs the easiest roaming super in the game to use, it has a 360¬∞ instakill radius that requires no aim, just anything around you dies. Same with stormtrance. One tree gives you the mobility of blink, the other is effectively a panic super and roaming super, with landfall.
---
Bottom line roaming supers are op pretty much across the board, people have wanted snipers to ohk for pretty much an entire year now
---
Oh god, the temptation quest for Last Word.

I was only able to beat that part because I did it when Opulence just started, and farmed off ppl AFKing for runes in Rumble.

Right, so come October 1st when the new expansion releases there will be a free version of Destiny for you to get into called "New Light"  
---
New Light includes all Destiny 2 year 1 DLC content, which is what is currently known as Red War, Curse of Osiris, and Warmind.  
---
New Light will also include limited access to Year 2 and 3 dlc content, including free-roam patrol zones, Gambit, and a few other things.  
---
If you want all content Destiny has to offer you will need to purchase Destiny 2 Forsaken+annual pass for access to all content included in Year 2 DLCs, and Destiny 2 Shadowkeep for the upcoming new Year 3 DLC content.  
---
Purchasing Forsaken or Shadowkeep now also includes Destiny 2 year 1 content, which everyone will have free access to in October anyway, you would just be getting access to play the content before it becomes free, which is negligible at this point in time.
---
You people don‚Äôt know how to get along, deleting this post.
---
Thank you!
---
So that means that pre-ordering shadowkeep (with my accounts linked) will include everything that I'v bought (All year 1 and year 2 DLCs)?
---
Don't let bungie see this or the next thing we'll see is shotguns in heavy slot.
---
Nope you need to get to 2100 this week! Good luck! You can do it!
---
I have every gun in the game.  And along the way, i have only used the best option when my confidence level is down.  Most of the time, i play for fun as i am assured to be doing my part.  I got the ghally on day three and yet only used it on entry of teams.  As soon as people started shooting, i swapped out to other setups because i never believed that you must use this or that.  I have had a ton more fun with the load outs that weren‚Äôt the top performing for any given activity.  Again, as long as i know we will win or know the math is more than enough, then i use guns that aren‚Äôt meta to have more fun. But if meta is needed, yes, use meta and lens isn‚Äôt gonna be used.
---
* **Shadowkeep will reset you to 0.** 
---
* **The game will be taken offline for a 24 maintenance on Monday.** 
---
* **You must hit 2100 before Monday if you want Fabled this Season**
---
* **Fabled requirement is only retroactive for the current Season, so if you aren't on the part of your PVP Pinnacle quest that requires Fabled, you'd have to get there before Monday + get Fabled, otherwise getting to Fabled would be a waste.**
---
I already have destiny 2 is this not the same thing?
---
I got a 24 hour ban because of my power company. I loaded up a comp game then the match started and my power went out. 30 min later it came back on so I started comp again. 30 seconds into the match the power went out again.
---
I‚Äôm just not having as much fun as I used to. And on top of that i‚Äôm not the biggest fan of grinding and i‚Äôm not close to max light anyways so i‚Äôll have to grind a lot in Shadowkeep.
---
As longs as you completed the links, all of your current licenses will transfer when you move to steam. Bungie has said that the forsaken licenses will take a little longer to transfer but the only lockout are story missions, strikes, and raids. This lockout will only last about a day.

Destiny will be free on shadow keep, but you're gonna have to buy shadow keep to play all the new stuff
---
Fenchurch Everis did exactly this. He said it smelled of vanilla.
---
Do a good deed daily
---
.. okay ..
---
Well, for one, Shadowkeep will bring everyone to 750 automatically.  So you'll be at the same place as everyone else.  Two, like i said, if youre not having much fun, then don't get it?  End of debate!
---
Sorry, your submission has been automatically removed. 
---
It appears you are asking a question about Destiny 2 error codes or a bug. 
---
We suggest Google searching your error code for more information about what you might be experiencing, or posting in /r/DestinyTechSupport
---
You can go to the tower then back out. Worked multiple times for me and my friends
---
There's sometimes a slight delay, either do what the rest said or just do another activity, D2 code can sometimes be slow
---
stoked they added a preload option on steam
---
So clearly I‚Äôm out of the loop, did BB hunters get a buff?
---
Just queue for a comp match, stop the queue and it will work.
---
I think the general idea is. You can play the previous stuff free and then the current expansion/season you pay ¬£30 for, unless you know you'll be sticking around, you pay ¬£50 for the current expansion, and the next one(?).
---
*This is like Hitman 2 all over again.*
---
You just need to get good
---
New light with shadowkeep release is putting everyone at 750. You'll be short a few weapons, but that's about it.
---
Gamer dirt, brother
---
Nah I still play Overwatch I need that.
---
Alrighty then I was showing that the mountaintop quest didn't unlock despite me reaching the goal the quest step said which was reach fable. How does me "GeTtiNg GoOD" have anything to do with this post? At least everyone else gave me actual advice as to what to do which helped me.
---
Damn this guy has so much salt, he might as well live in the Mariana Trench
---
MTashed has a good YouTube video giving his recommendations
---
Fine. Get gooder.
---
Still not relevant to the post bud
---
Alright thanks for the help
---
I‚Äôm a smartass. What do you expect?
---
No, this chart is somewhat confusing. The forsaken story missions, along with all of the content for the seasons over the year were very good and I strongly recommend getting it if you think you'd be lost story mission wise, or just want to be a completionist. That being said, it is not required in order to play shadow keep. You can purchase just shadow keep and be able to play it with no issues. Plus, the strikes and crucible maps from forsaken DLC are included with base game regardless. Youd be missing out on story missions. I'm not sure if exotic weapon quests would require forsaken DLC if they occurred during the last year.
---
Yeah but does it gives the rewards from previous events? Either way, thanks for the info!
---
Ohhh
---
Ay my guy , quick update I restarted the game and it went back to normal
---
Have u been living under a rock for the last 8 years?
---
Nothing since you were obviously trolling just joshing around with you since im bored
---
Lol. Nah
---
üëå
---
THOSE EXIST(IN LIKE ANYTHING)?!??!
---
Also any of the raids that came out over the past year (which were 3) will not be accessible if forsaken DLC is not purchased. But like I said, it's not needed
---
If you're into PVP try to get a Redrix Broadsword from a quest shaxx gives you because the weapon archetype is going to be meta in crucible. For PVP try to get a good shotgun.
---
I mean... it is also arc singe this week with heavyweight today.
---
Yes. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôve been living. Under a rock
---
Probably one of the best parts of steam is the modding community. And just the community involvement in general. Loads of reviews, loads of groups, easy to connect to friends, and despite the huge amount of information I feel like they‚Äôve organized it well. There are some issues with UI on things like game searches, and the overlay can get buggy with different games, but they update pretty frequently. 
---
TLDR people like steam because it has a lot of features, though there are occasionally some minor bugs and issues in implementation of said features
---
Do I have to switch? Im lazy and would just rather use battle.net
---
You design armor?
---
You probably play Fortnite.
---
Also came here to say, this man is a savage.
---
If you don't switch you can no longer play the game on pc
---
I feel represented! :)
---
I believe once you cross save, if he. You unlink stuff your stuck for 90 days before you can cross save again. 
---
Also no to what he wants, he can‚Äôt move characters from 1 Xbox GT to another
---
He does, can confirm.
---
Damn alright ty
---
Will time played carry over?
---
What platform are you playing on and what content are you looking to do
---
If he unlinks/deactivates his xbox today would that prevent him from playing on steam? Thank on the response!
