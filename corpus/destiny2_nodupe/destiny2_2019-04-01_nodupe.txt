It looks good on Dredgen looks, with tattered armor and an evil undertone.

---
You can get the illicit gambit prime gear by synthesizing the synths and then completed the run. As far as Im aware the gambit prime weapons only drop in tier 2 and 3 as a completion reward. Other then the armour reqard at the end the rewards are the standard blue engram, legendary, prime and if your lucky exotics.
---
Ahh the good ol' days :)
---
What makes this the rarest?
---
Idk if you're on console or pc but on console the recoil and bloom of Thorn, Ace and less so on TLW makes them much harder to use. This isn't a change that would be taken well on console.
---
Yeah it definitelt is, that was never in the equation lol.
---
I smell crit spot
---
How do you get cursebreaker? Is it one of the secret ones? 
---
Yeah, I do too. It heavily depends on the shader you apply to it.
---
O thanks for letting know!
---
Maybe on light.gg it displays as rarest
---
Cursebreaker is the one I want, is it one of the secret ones? 
---
But, it has the Telesto charge meter, the Telesto projectiles, and I imagine the only reason the nova bomb tracked its caster was because it locked into a Telesto projectile. Most tellingly, there is a unique Telesto sillhouette in the equipped weapon HUD.
---
You only get 1 core per week don't you? That's nothing.
---
I'm still struggling with frigid jackal. did the last braytech weapon take you forever?
---
Looks like my GameStop in poinciana fla....
---
He‚Äôs been beating them, consistently...
---
Isnt sagira shell the rarest?
---
I feel you dude. I was this close to quitting the thorn quest for that same reason but at the very least bungie had the intelligence to not make deaths lose progress.
---
Can confirm, got One Thousand Voices after skipping to Riven and finishing Last Wish for the first time. Two people we did it with still have me blocked and we did it last week.
---
I honestly wouldn‚Äôt mind this, but there could be the problem of having people queue at the same time and if they manage to get in the same game they could work together which would just really suck
---
Saw the cause with chicken in a GameStop the other day. Is it really that rare?
---
I was just telling my fiance. I was playing a Gambit Prime round and during the Primeval phase I pop out spectral blades when we suddenly get invaded.
---

---
This Titan is coming right at us and when I move toward him he starts to literally walk backwards the way he came from.
---
Surprisingly it took me 3 schwinks to take him down.
---
Looks like a multi-tool
---
The hand cannon? No idea. Looks kinda like fatebringer
---
It was actually the Osprey that took me forever. I think I did that NF 150x, now i get nauseous when it come up in rotation. 
---
I got Eyasluna vibes from the paint on it but who knows. Pretty cool though. 
---
With the right shader, I wonder if it could look kinda like the blue demon mask from TLAB. 
---
Well that would just be flinching to a hand cannon. Its not that hand cannons have more range than a sniper. If I was hit with a hand cannon shot I think I would do more than flinch. I would suggest training your reaction time. And to really abuse that radar provided. Thats how I get my kills.
---
I used foam pads and barge glue to make the helmet.
---
I sweat every time I turn around there‚Äôs a small army of exploder shanks
---
Holy shit!! MY FIRST GOLD!
---
It‚Äôs not OP. I just feel like the spam is just as annoying as pre-patch Telesto. Telesto was OP, Jotunn is the most annoying gun to play against.
---
Is the progress more if your light is lower than theirs? Or is it only based off their light level?
---
Bad ass! I had warlock on my list of cosplays to do some day. You did an amazing job!
---
The hand cannon is a D1 The Devil You Know vanguard hand cannon(although it was painted red instead of orange). The scout rifle is not Mida, but it was based off that scout model.
---
You have to finish the requirements just like any of the Titles. I'm confused about your question, elaborate?
---
Yes, but the round had ended
---
True, just Mara was there and her head was turning so I figured she could have something to do with it.
---
Boondock Saints!
---
Yes it counts all kills just gives extra percentage for killing higher light guardians.
---
Celestial is all ready verrrrrry strong is pve and this change wouldn‚Äôt help the pvp side. So no?
---
No that was just a figure to give us a clue to who they were talking about otherwise people would be asking who it was they were talking about like you just now.
---
mountaintop is definitely worth it, its effectively a rocket launcher that goes in your kinetic slot and i think is the only one of its kind. lunas, NF and recluse all have other weapons that come close or fit the same role regardless of whether they do it well or not. but with mountaintop, nothing even comes close.
---
Thanks! As you can see in the one screenshot I didn't think about it until later but it just dawned on me one day and it just fit so well I couldn't resist lol
---
Plus during convos at the top right it goves you the names of those currently talking. And it was only the nine and the emissary.
---
It's pretty clear now, it looks like I'll have to get it if I want to keep playing the game regularly. Thank you for the information, the image sealed the deal for me.
---
just hammerhead/thunderlord your way to victory, nothing difficult about that. now the 7 kills in 1 invade on the other hand, that one i gotta see.
---
Instead of bringing up OCD I tried to be relaxed, but you‚Äôre hard headed and an elitist. I can‚Äôt change your mind, and that‚Äôs it. I have yet to lie. I have yet to understand why your mad about me wanting a cosmetic change, because I like the crispy ness of an emblem with no numbers...? Like the little ghost shell emblem, what if it displayed dead ghosts.. I wouldn‚Äôt want that while some would! There‚Äôs nothing wrong with customization. I have a reasonable reason, you shot it down. I gave another, you shot it down. I gave a mental reason for why it bothers me, and you shot it down. I didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI HAVE OCD AND YOU‚ÄôRE NOT RESPECTING MY DISABILITY‚Äù I said, I gave OCD and I don‚Äôt like it not being parallel on both sides.

That ornament is great. Its the enemy themed gear we've been asking for more of.

This is a repost, not his content

I've had the exact same. Stuck at that power level and then my last 5 Prime Engrams were all for primary slot..... So much salt on my end üòÇ
---
Where does this info come from? Like is it lore or where do I find it in game?
---
That's the way. I cheesed it by drawing a bow and aiming, then the arrow gets released when you enter the dome. But last time I did that bounty I was way underleveled. 
---
I found it strange for it to be called a fusion rifle. GL or RL fits better.
---
JUMP UP!
---
I didn‚Äôt have a bow but I‚Äôll try that next time. I was mad confused because I did it for the first time the other day and thought I had to do something with the war beasts lmao 
---
But hey, look at the positive, you got a bunch of legendary shards.

It's a great place 
---
Or you can be a hunter and teleport through the nth dimension just to melee and die
---
I find fun in using sidearms and smgs from time to time along with some of the old weapons like dire promise, DFA, Skyburners, and The vision sidearm with kill clip from the future war cult 
---
This is awesome! I'm stuck debating between a Hunter and a Warlock for my next cosplay. Love the accessories on your costume, gives it that extra survivor/ gunslinger look!
---
Whats good about erentil mate? 
---
To me a blueberry is the same as a randumb. You can be a good blue player, then you can be one of those players that see that if you hit the prison escapee with one more orb you can get bonus rewards. But fuck that shit, you need to speed run this shit so you immediately super the fucker into oblivion
---
My hunter in Gambit, every single time :|
---
All you really need is Forsaken, which comes with Curse of Osiris, Warmind, and one level 30 character boost. 
---
The only thing not included with Forsaken at this point is the annual pass, a bundle of three DLCs being released over the course of a year. They are all extra end game activities to do after Forsaken, so you don't need it unless you plan to play a lot. 
---
If you see an item in your collections tab that you do not have (greyed out or listed as unknown), it is obtainable. 
---
If it doesn't show up in collections, it is no longer obtainable. 
---
He‚Äôs basically saying that when we make a mistake it‚Äôs just a simple error, but when someone else makes a mistake they‚Äôre an absolute fucking moron and should never touch a controller/keyboard again in their life.
---
Sensing a giant blocker also yields a chance for the collector synth and spare rations. 
---
The Zavala story cinematic also implies that a bit, doesn't it? Like he learns and grows from every time he gets killed on his way to the City. It also seemed like the revival itself is kind of painful, or at least traumatic in some way.
---
"look brothers!......i've been chosen!!!"
---
novawarp warlock is still fun, contraverse hold and 5 grenade mods means lots of handheld supernovas. 
---
Oh wow, screw 2 20s &amp; a 10 ima go 3 20s from now on
---
It's an amazing collection! I've been meaning to get my hands on a few as well, but Funko doesn't sell these where I live so my only option is imports, which ends up being on the expensive side. Still worth it, though! :)
---
The other night I did leviathan and one kid joined and said ‚ÄúI gotta go to bed in half an hour btw guys so let‚Äôs get this done quick‚Äù

Yeah makes sense. I was wondering ‚Äúif you need tether and well, why isn‚Äôt every warlock/hunter those specs?‚Äù
---
Thanks for your reply 
---
FLY YOU FOOL!
---
.yeah i honestly cant find a solution, the best thing ive found is to minimise any other windows, turn on G sync, turn off the fps counter and pretend everything is fine.  
---
so far i have tried various general optimisations, installing on different hard drives, running in compatibility mode, repairing files thorugh bnet, reinstalling, running at 50% render scaling, taking off overclock on all hardware, clean installation of GPU drivers - installing legacy drivers, changing RAM clock speed and even a full format and clean installation of the whole OS.  
---
the real kicker is that i have a friend who through similar optimisations with a 1060 and an 8th gen i5 is able to get 200+ in crucible matches the only thing i can assume is that it is the processor. 
---
Only the first time I‚Äôve ever seen this.
---
Then you are new or don't frequent the sub very often.
---
That's a D1 hand cannon. How are you using 2 primaries?
---
I didn‚Äôt know reaper was in destiny?
---
I think it‚Äôs if you are lower than theirs, that‚Äôs what I took it as anyway :)

"There might be some ingredients down here"

running from people with supers is an underrated passtime
---
I never stated your post was incorrect. I only added my take on the subject at hand.
---
I usually farm Reckoning to get outlast MW drops. I‚Äôve stacked a good amount of cores from it
---
GJ ornament allows you to actually apply shaders though. Orpheus Rig ornament is pretty meh also.
---
300 can be accomplished in like 3 or 4 hours it‚Äôs new content from there 
---
He just gave sedia her last word ha HA
---
Any sniper or shotgun in the kinetic or energy slot then. 
---
I hope they sell Laconic soon, I totally missed out on it when TLW released because I couldn‚Äôt play for a month or so :(.
---
I dunno. You could probably link it through your bungie account. And 300 power isn‚Äôt even remotely hard to get to. (If you have forsaken)
---
kill streak? what's that?
---
It's beautiful! I love feeling like a crazed joker parrot!
---
&gt; Whats good about erentil mate?   
---
High impact fusion rifles only take 4 bolts to kill and that archetype also has the highest range for fusion rifles so you can literally map people with Erentil.
---
&amp;#x200B;

Through fire and flood is a fake gambit weapon. There‚Äôs also a fake dreaming city sidearm called translation theory.

Okay this video could have been 30 seconds shorter

What weapon is it this week
---
911 upvotes. Keep it that way
---
Let's clear something up real quick. IF YOU KILL HIM THIS WAY YOU DON'T GET HIS WEAPON DROP. THEY DON'T GO TO THE POSTMASTER.
---
As you alread said, year 2 weapons (Forsaken/Annual Pass) are much stronger, which is why they probably decided they dont need a catalyst, they didnt say anything about those on social media atleast
---
As of now in my time zone we still have 17 hours. Will be disappointed if this opportunity is missed.
---
Not sure what is the trigger but I think he meant he doesn't wanted to see us dead. I wouldn't say it has to do with the alliance quest since I got this dialogue poped up a few weeks back before the Joker's Wild started.
---
Hey what was that sniper you used after the shotgun? Never saw an invisible sniper
---
k‚ÄôhhhHHHHHHHHHH  hooooooooooooooo

Nah, nah....now I know what the blueberries are doing when I'm on their team and I'm too busy trying to find the invader.

Ikelos sniper right?

it is tho

I started to like it tbh

oh yeah, those were a pain when i had to do three heroic for some quest
---
Possibly üòÇ I hate me too
---
An *hour* for me. My buddy needed a 100k, and the pulse so I decided to do the nightfall. We had extuingish and wiped twice. The *third* time, the ball to toss didn't spawn. The FOURTH and FINAL time, our score was 100k, but we took too long and ducked down to 97k. 
---
THIS IS AMAZING
---
Pretty much just how I talk.
---
April Fool's?
---
but this isnt Borderlands.....???
---
Difficult to compare the two. I think they can easily co-exist. 
---
People taking a little break and shifting their playtime to something else doesn't mean a game is being killed off. 
---
Well I'm with you especially with the release of borderlands 1 remaster and the release of borderlands 3 sometime soon. Destiny is a great game and I enjoy it a lot but I enjoy it but I enjoy it for the fact that's its mmo. I personally dont feel like it's a looter shooter.  The game has great lore but endgame is the same thing every week so gets boring. The gambit stuff isnt bad but again same thing plus solo queuing isnt that much fun for it. Pvp is just a bunch of try hard rolling shottys feels worse then cod at times. I dont like that their is a weapon meta makes it so your basically stuck using only a handful of guns to be able to do anything easily in pve and pvp. There is nothing really to loot besides you powerfuls for daily and weekly I want to be able to go explore and find better gear and weapon not stuck to specific activities to get better gear or weapons. There is only a handful of weapons and armor you can get which takes away from the looting. My biggest pet peeve is they have amazing lore and the story is fun to play but you cant play the story again besides the couple mission they give for heroic daily missions I would love to be able to play the campaign again. These are just my issues with it I want to go loot not just have to run activities for the 100th something time for the same weapon or armor let me explore the world get stronger weapons and gear. Make more armor give us stuff to loot not just endgame activities. Or change your genre to just an mmofps stop trying to be a looter shooter if they did that I think they would have a better chance and not get all the hate they do. This should be like wow a service game. 
---
Oh sorry, didn't see their were more pictures.  Yeah, it's going to be a grind.
---
The irony is amazing
---
I actually took a break a week before black armory because of finals and I just never started playing again because I wasn‚Äôt interested. I saw all the memes about sunshot shell and it made me come back and start playing again just because I want it so bad I don‚Äôt want to miss out on it.
---
Yeah, but if he drop the weapons on death they'd be in the postmaster.
---
There‚Äôs no six guy because their having dinner with he‚Äôs parents.
---
Until the reset or after

Seriously, people been pushing Destiny bosses off cliffs for a while now.
---
1. 10-second intro for 2 lines of text. Why?
---
1. "Destiny 2 Montage" is not a title. If anything, it's a placeholder.
---
1. All of the clips had multiple seconds of inaction before and after the actual action happened. like 2 seconds before or after each clip adds up to a lot of time the viewer is thinking "why the hell am I watching this?"
---
1. None of the clips were interesting. Nothing spectacular happened, everything seemed mundane and standard. The most interesting thing was that you used your super and got 2 kills. That's not a very good clip in itself, but that's the best clip I saw. Using an entire mag from Scathelock to get one kill, reloading, then using another entire mag for another kill is not interesting. If you don't have anything better, don't make a video. You can have the best editing of all time, but with crappy content, the video will be crappy.
---
1. Biggest tip is to not make a video without good content. Bad editing with good content is better than good editing with bad content.
---
Extra Agility, of course.
---
Whats that? I joined a three stack on gambit prime who all have the full armor set to show what role they're gonna have during the game? Fuck it. Im just going to steal heavy, camp the portal, and steal the motes from the collector cause im obviously the best and nothing else matters. Fuck team work

Yep

This is why I ALWAYS launch the vehicle off the cliff when this boss starts lol

A¬†Pyrrhic victory¬†is a¬†victory¬†that inflicts such a devastating toll on the victor that it is tantamount to defeat. Someone who wins a¬†Pyrrhic victory¬†has also taken a heavy toll that negates any true sense of achievement.

Can you please give me your luck?

Dont fancy my chances of a good roll with how much i play and the current loot pool odds.

Same thing happened to me.  You gotta do the special heroic adventure that appears after you complete all the invitation items.
---
Doesn‚Äôt really tell you, I had to find out the hard way.  Also the name of the heroic adventure is different from the actual normal adventure.  It‚Äôs sorta confusing.
---
I feel bad for that guy
---
This deserves way more upvotes!
---
Must be nice lol. I received a raging hate message after a comp game the other day because I was ‚Äúusing a bow to get easy kills‚Äù and didn‚Äôt use my other weapons enough. The guy‚Äôs username was ‚ÄúDestinyExpert1‚Äù
---
It blows my mind the level of creativity people can have, this is awesome!
---
I feel you. I love strikes especially, but anymore they just seem like a joke. Maybe it's just been a while but D1 strikes felt more challenging, albeit there were fewer of them. 
---
Just a new one every month or two would help keep the rotation from feeling so stale; older strikes would be refreshing again since they wouldn't pop up so much. Weeklies wouldn't feel like such a chore. 
---
Forsaken added at least 3 strikes off the top  y head. Warden of Nothing, the corrupted, and that one where we have to kill the Ganatic again because he rezed himself.
---
I am going right now but even in Calculus we don‚Äôt talk like that lmao 
---
but they dont so your wasting people's time with a thing you could do to any other mob in the game.
---
It's fine I only complained a lot when I found out it's exclusive and I'd probably use black talon if you don't already have it included. 
---
Whoa, that looks amazing! If I may ask, how did you get the holes in the grid part of Sleeper? Did you have to use a drill? 
---
Yeah. What is it that you like about that compared to Duke? Is it the better devils body/sights?
---
I never consider the fun of my opponents either, especially not in pve.

that free copy was a good move.  i haven't stop playing destiny since i got it.  also may throw some moeney towardsthe lore book
---
Haven't read it yet but it's by bungie.I guess 2nd volume will be destiny 2 oriented.
---
would'nt they just go to your postmaster anyway??
---
I agree. I know it's all the hunters have in pvp but it's annoying when 3-4 out of 6 of them are always the same thing... sometimes these guys pop 2 spectral blades at a time. Granted, I use it too the once or twice a week on my hunter, but it's so scary.
---
For some reason that player kept using it too early all game, I got hit like 3-4 times and each time it only did 50% of my health and knocked me way back
---
You did kind of get shit on though, pretty well deserved tbag 
---
Can‚Äôt relate 
---
I‚Äôd argue that maybe 1/3 of the hunter exotics aren‚Äôt as powerful as others, like Shinobu‚Äôs Vow or Gemini Jester as these are super situational. But I definitely think that when it comes to hunter builds they have a lot more options when it comes to pairing exotics armor pieces with different weapons or perks to make some really powerful combinations. 
---
Warlocks on the other hand seem to be lacking in the wow factor that exotics are supposed to bring. 
---
I don‚Äôt want to sound like I‚Äôm whining to give warlocks broken exotics (although I really want more broken exotics) but I find a lot of trouble making builds that focus on synergy rather than allowing for simply a faster reload time or that only find value when you die. 
---
(Sorry for such a long response on this I just really enjoy the topic of builds)
---
I almost chose that and honestly would change it, but I don't feel like it effects it enough to worry over. also thanks for feedback, i appreciate it
---
I believe the IKELOS weapons are static drops, not curated. The difference is static weapons can drop ONLY with those perks. Curated weapons are the roll of a weapon deemed the "best" by Bungie. Example: Kindled Orchid, the forge hand cannon. It can drop with any random roll, but the curated version drops with Kill Clip, Rampage, and a Range Masterwork.
---
Than You for this I had no clue this was a thing gonna go grab this!
---
Ah. Nice to know.
---
Let‚Äôs just hope they don‚Äôt make it broken like it was before
---
Ah, I wasn't aware the two were different. Thanks for the explanation.

For Grace, Eye of Another World is decent. It's basically the Hallowfire Hear but for all Warlock subclasses. By far the most underrated Warlock exotic.

Yeah it makes me feel jipped for running for lunas least season lol. I guess the quest steps still took forever though so.. it's fun too though. A little sadistic part of me likes the intensity

Oh yeah, countdown, that shit's just always awful no matter what happens.

I‚Äôm just glad I don‚Äôt have to grind all season for it lol
---
I love the idea of verity‚Äôs brow encouraging energy weapon usage for abilities, although it makes me feel super limited in my choices for weapons, and synergy. If you‚Äôve read any of my replies you‚Äôd notice my annoying problem with most of these exotics being the synergy (or lack thereof). 
---
But with Verity‚Äôs specifically, I feel that once I get my hands on recluse, the exotic would feel super powerful  especially when combined with something like devour...

True but you wanna take the time to look because if you have weapons with different elemental damage, the collections will exclusively drop only ONE element post-Forsaken. A few were locked no matter what, like the Ikelos weapons, but the rest stayed if you kept them before update.

Honestly though as the British guy, American servers are much more welcoming and inviting than most European ones.

You admit to being a primarily pve player yet don‚Äôt care if pvp is removed. Maybe try seeing it from the perspective of those who play for the pvp and not the pve 
---
I did this exact same thing. It's so good
---
For comparison, my 1400:
---
2 exotic dupes (Standasides &amp; AC/D0)
---
1240 Legendary shards back
---
40 enhancement cores
---
armor seems to be on a knockout system, got more weapons later. MW weapons dismantle for 2 vs 1 for armor
---
+some glimmer and ~700 gunsmith mats
---
Iron banner &amp; blade barrage, ez orbs

I have full bore. i win.
---

---
Yeah same for me and even a bit more ;)
---
That one titan who absolutely ***has*** to shoulder charge you even if you're in the middle of your team with basically zero hp and even a shot from a sidearm will kill you.
---
Damn we got a Destiny pro over here
---
Oh yeah, using a slug shotgun around a corner, the embodiment of skill
---
Bungie is not Jagex nice try
---

---
I smell something malicious....
---

---
Same here brother. Same here.

it just lasts so long with the giswin vest. It feels like you can hunt down and wipe the whole team twice over with it. 
---
r/warlocksglideup ?
---
Yeah me too, but they take skill to proc
---
you can rerun lvl 1 over and over again to clear the quest. this week is smg week iirc, not many people interested in farming that so getting to lvl 7 is difficult. 
---
Huh?
---
The ‚Äúlook at my gun‚Äù guy
---
Oh boy another DRB in crucible...sigh....its core terminus that has the highest drop rate. 
---
#YEAH BUT THEN YOU'RE PLAYING THE GAME WITHOUT A SUPER.
---
The last word was invented in like the 1800s 
---
fated engrams don't contain forsaken exotics yet. maybe next season they will but for now they don't. the only way is to wait and pray he sells whatever exotic you're missing. 
---
Take my likes 
---
Happened to me too. Was very surprised an glad at the same time.
---
I like.
---
And I hate everything.
---
Thank you very much!
---
Imagine using Nova Warp in PvP when you could be using *literally any other warlock super*
---
Hate me if y‚Äôall want, but I fucking hate Shaxx with a passion
---
might not be aimbot, machineguns in general are broken in pvp, they're too damn accurate and way more forgiving than queenbreaker ever was. not to mention the ammo count.
---
Nova warp then Mobius quiver. For real who uses that garbage?
