Gimme a mission where youre travel in with the Red Jacks in securing new Crucible maps but you discover some crazy shit. Like a graveyard of people or Risen, a new Hive creature, or in attempting to move into enemy territory, you discover Awoken refugees behind enemy lines and help them get to the city.
---
---
---
I mean it should definitely be PvP focused... considering we haven’t received any pvp content since forsaken, and for one week in February...
---
go to the tangled shore to do the quest.
---
Okay, thanks!
---
I got to the point where i actually used the talisman during the final quest to get to bow, but had to quit as i wasnt a high enough light level. I was wondering if because i left the quest if the talisman is still 'active' so to speak
---
It’s the recluse I’m guessing from the colors and rough shape
---
Clusters didn’t get nerfed Bungie moved the damage to the initial rocket blast
---
It requires any Echo (or Echo Dot) device to work it, but here's the silliest shit:
---
You don't need it. You can do all of the ghost stuff on an Echo and the sound is far better.

You take that photo from a moving car? It's near impossible to figure out what it is.
---
Those are the symbols of the nine. They are universally used for all of the nine stuff 
---
I’m sorry mah dude
---
Queenbreaker is pretty good.
---
The choice isn't Vanguard or Drifter. The Vanguard hasn't moved against him, just Aunor. Shaxx is on the side that makes Guardians stronger, I think I know the side.
---
Seems like they shit on you the more you play.  I play the most out of me and two friends who play, yet I get the fewest exotics and they're mostly duplicates when they do drop.
---
Whatever Bungie has said publicly about exotics, and what happens behind the scenes, are two wildly different situations.  There's also those people who don't play for 1-2 months and then get showered in exotics the day they come back.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Shaxx doesn't care about strength. He cares about the people.
---
I'm sorry but no hand cannon should be better than lunas/nf, people spent months grinding for those guns. Months. To make a freebie exotic hand cannon better than them would be a giant slap in the face.
---
I play on Xbox one
---
Yeah I've mostly gone back to Ace since Memento Mori rewards my chronic reloading with extra damage instead.
---
In that case, watch a tutorial on the raid and make an LFG post on the bungo website. Make sure to include that its your first run, honesty comes a long way. Then work on the other things I mentioned. It's a fairly simple raid and should only take 45 min-1 hour if you know what you're doing.
---
If you teabagged me I'd be cracking up.
---
I only get angry with bags when theres no skill involved like a shotty ape camping around a corner
---
Tbagging is unsportsmanlike and never a respectable form of behaviour.
---
agreed. a situation i’d bag in is when a spectral blades gets shutout by some bullshit primary or something of that nature
---
its unfortunate most of the community basically asks for it specifically by doing it first :/

the ikelos hand canon sadly is more consistent than the thorn so it will be the opposite for me

---
No no I meant like the first time I started using spectral blades when I unlocked it I didn’t know going invisible drains it less. Then when using gwisin it just etches into your mind to always be invisible basically. 
---
If they do that they actually have to create content..... Mind Blown

---
Ace also is just an old blue HC from year 1 with radar and some buffs :'(  
---
I think its called... Azimuth DSU
---
Better than Thorn, not better than a well rolled Service Revolver.
---
Hand cannons are my least used and least liked weapon in the game and all these hand cannon exotic quests make me want to reconsider but then I see the pvp requirements and bail lol I'm far to bad at pvp to earn anything more than the only exotic hand cannon I will ever bother with earning (caydes obviously). I dont even bother with the pvp daily or weekly lol
---
They should have a path that doesn't require PvP.  If they want to funnel people into the PvP then make the non PvP path like double what it would take to get it via the PvP path.
---
is it 90 degrees?
---
If you play 3 game that week the. It hits on the reset

you can learn to levitate with just a little help

LMFAO FR THO
---
[removed]
---
I didn't even use void lol. Just used Ace and got the whole quest done in about 16 games give or take
---
Please say you know what it is and joking.
---
Vostok is my baby. 
---
(If you only played D2 that is an exception)
---
What's the "Gambit ship"?
---
Really nothing all that humorous. Just the number and what it signifies to some people, and the name of the gun.
---
This is what pisses me off about Destiny's story. This kind of stuff should be a cinematic or a story mission where you play as an old guardian that was in that battle.
---
The reason both Handcannons required pvp is because they are directly related to crucible...
---
It makes sense lore wise to obtain these guns through crucible
---
I havent had a lore piece drop using thorn. Wtf? 
---
Keep up that positive mindset, and for the love of god find a Lfg group to 4 stack with, use destiny tracker and make sure they have decent stats.
---
A 4 stack with great communication will carry you a long way in comp. 
---
Don’t get frustrated, you’ll lose some games, take a break and come back in a day or two to grind again. The grind is hard, and tedious, but the reward is satisfying 
---
Not even close. The pvp path was quickest
---
Me toooooo
---
GG celesti one shots knights. Plus if u skip the knights it doesnt count we timed 3 celesti GG perfectly and 1 shot the boss from above half health and we didnt get thorn lol
---
Alright alright alright, I’ll make it look like a blood accident.  
---
It's because it makes sense lore wise to include crucible in these steps. Last Word and Thorn are pvp guns. 
---
I do agree to an extent. Even with a 80 member clan it still takes us 1-3 hours to get a group ready. Raiding is easier in FFXIV and WoW.
---
Id rather have that than shotty apes
---
This format is hilarious
---
Well its a pvp gun so
---
Just keep using it. I go on patrols, killing everything I see. The drop rate is really low, but you'll get it if you keep killing stuff. I just pop a podcast or music on in the background, go to a planet that im low on materials, and go hog wild.
---
Snitch.
---
I don't get why people whine about having to do pvp for a pvp gun. Honestly, people always talk about lore and when Bungie introduces a quest that makes sense lore wise all the pve players lose their shit
---
I only completed the quest for Cayde's maybe a month or two ago. Those crucible precision kills took me forever and I didn't want to force myself to dislike PvP more than I could tolerate, so I took my sweet time. But also switching it up to using Crimson took the edge off a loooooot.
---
I can hear someone already saying, "Oh its cause I'm melting pt/tractoring".  
---
Hahahaha. I love this. what big legs/arms/claws/appendages they have. 
---
I have the gun and I have no idea. It just dropped into my inventory one day and I don't know how or why lmao
---
You win, Bungie.
---
Bad idea pc players would destroy us console players.

Hopefully there won't be any exotic hand cannons for a long, long time. I'm so sick of them.

Blast Furnace is a great pulse. And Hammerhead is amazing with several different rolls.

Great work, guardian.

I doubt those restraints would even keep him from hitting the mightiest dab earth has ever seen. Maybe he didnt really die but ascended to another plain of existance because of it.
---
Best roast in Destiny? More like best roast of all time. If you disagree, then you don’t deserve to be called a guardian.
---
I like your handwriting. So much neater than mine. 
---
I'm barely OK in PVP. Don't really like these PVP portions of quests however I managed to get it done. As odd as it sounds, I found it easier to complete this playing comp rather than QP. Comp Clash/Control were the best obviously. It took me about 20-ish games to get that part of the quest completed and damn near the whole day but i git 'er done. 
---
Its magical. I still run LW just to flex it on everyone else in the raid lol
---
Comp gives extra points in it, but until IB is here, that's where all the sweats will be.
---
Eyes down guardian 
---
Bruh Thorn is unreal in Pve. You never have to reload and it one shots the squishies
---
Building touch was so fun. 
---
off topic but that ramen is THE BEST omg
---
Pretty sure it still drops from Escalation Protocol.
---
If you ghost could shoot with the sun shot and aid you that would be great
---
Fuck it I'm gonna buy em all.
---
You can still do the warmind campaign, just pop down to Mars and chat to Ana Bray.
---
Thorn, The Last Word, Malfeasance. What’s the fourth?
---
As Heavy of a grind that it was, it truly was a great experience. Same with Necrochasm
---
If you don't use this line as your ultimate trump card in a roast session, then I don't know what you're doing with your life.
---
The handcannon doesn't it's from the storyline quests
---
Ace of Spades. Whoops. Nvm. 
---
Holyyyy shiiiit
---
I like that ending better lol
---
Praying for hawkawesome and i will do whatever jt takes to get that gun. _whatever it takes_.
---
When I first got it my friend asked if I was throwing hammers. I was a hunter at the time. 
---
Warlocks need rifts that damage enemies, an exotic that gives immediate over shields to you and allies when placing a rift. A one hit melee. And that’s all I want for my warlock.
---
Not saying nf level I’m just saying the same recoil as pc
---
Eh I did it, I'm stuck on the strike as my fireteam isn't on till tomorrow 
---
Yes
---
And outbreak prime. Man, they're really dropping the ball with these recent gun quests. 
---
I know what you mean and I agree with you. Warlocks are at in pretty good place at the moment balance wise, but some variety would be good in the solar class. I don't think another tree would be made, but I think they could modify the top or bottom tree as they don't really feel too different from one another, especially with the Super. 
---
Lol super sweaty? What part of it is super sweaty? Just because you can’t do it in a game and a half does not make it sweaty. 
---
Oh boy, another frustrating quest for a fancy paper weight I'll never use... Ugh. 
---
list of loot based games with good pvp:
---
I’m sure they’ll include better exotic quests, especially in the new season after drifter. Penumbra I think it’s called?
---
I honestly dont mind it how it is. The crappy thing about it if it was with valor people would just afk. Just like getting Breakneck last season. 
---
It’s for people who play only crucible. If you don’t want to play all that the crucible has to offer you shouldn’t get it. And if you’re a completionist then take your time with it. It’s why they made the quests cross seasons.
---
Wasn't just talking about Thorn.
---
I'm aware it's pvp.. But things like Ace are great for both.
---
I may be wrong here, I haven't looked up the definition, but doesn't that mean, like, puzzles or something? 
---
Yeah it’s like another word for mystery, and I think that Penumbra is gonna focus on the secrets of the Leviathen, and a new raid
---
Oddly enough, when I played there weren't too many sweats. I think they and their Luna/Not Forgotten were all in QP boosting their KD's. Ran into a few 4 stacks, sure, but there were quite a few horrible teams I played against as well. Luckily for me, about a quarter of the matches I had, were 4v3 or 4v2 due to rage quits from the enemy team. Definitely helped out quite a bit. 
---
That would be dope af. 
---
\*looks to the left\*
---
\*looks to the right\*
---
as much as i love the exotic hand cannons in the game i wpuld like to see some brand new non hand cannon exotics. At some point that is.
---
Snitch 
---
I did Rumble with Telesto. More opportunities for kills, and at least on PC, always some idlers spamming macros, for free kills.
---
kind of like the little chao pets in sonic adventure.   
---
anybody remember that? you could put em on your vmus? dreamcast was ahead of its time i freakin loved that system. jet set radio, armada, shenmue,, crazy taxi...good times.
---
In no way shape or form was I “raging” and I certainly dont have anger issues. I am expressing how annoying it is to have PvE players who complain everytime a gun that is made for PvP has PvP steps. I myself play mainly PvE, but if I want the gun I shutup and do the quest steps.
---
And for the record Gambit was Caydes idea, Drifter executed. Did you not play Ace in the hole? 
---
If you keep at it you'll get it eventually, since unlike TLW's quest step, you don't get set back when you die. I'm bad at PVP and have poor reaction time and it took me about 6 hours of grind to get through that step using a Kindled Orchid. It sucked, but it still got completed. Perhaps set a goal for how much percentage you'd like to get a day to make it seem like you're making more progress and it feels less hopeless? I want to say it's something like 100 void handcannon kills in comp and 300-400 of the same in QP or Rumble to complete it.
---
It's really not even worth it. Ace of Spades is still better, and Luna's Howl / Not Forgotten still outperform. In PvE it was OK, but it just doesn't feel great, and forces you into close range to keep Soul Devourer proc'd. If you play it right, you never have to reload, but that was at the cost of danger. I much prefer a hand canon with a maxed out range stat, so I can play back like a scout or sniper.
---
Since you need to get the kills yourself to get progress, can you really carry someone through this particular quest step, save from logging onto their account and doing it for them?
---
Dreggs
---
Is this for thorn or did I miss a weapon?
---
Yikes only 2. I was a sherpa for d1. But d2 didnt have the same excitement of watching a 1st timer kill the boss in their epic moment.  
---
Shit Fallout 4 VR with mods will smoke that easy, game has more mods than a Kardashian. It will be unrecognizable by the time you're done, then when you take all the mods off it looks like Khloe. \*shudders\*
---
Is that a watermark I see?
---
I would consult the \[Bungie support forums\]([https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics?pNumber=0&amp;tg=Help&amp;tSort=0&amp;tType=0&amp;d=0&amp;lang=en](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics?pNumber=0&amp;tg=Help&amp;tSort=0&amp;tType=0&amp;d=0&amp;lang=en)) as they might have more technical information than someone here. 
---
Seems like he had the last word in this conversation.
---
Farming clears and playing looted runs are two seperate things. It's like doing the raid week one then completing it 20 more times in the same week them complaining you dont have all the loot.
---
There's a new quest?
---
Kinda, ATT is using the 5G logo to sell their 'advanced' capabilities, it's not real 5G yet.
---
It just takes getting good with a certain weapon. I will admit I’m pretty good at crucible in fact this was the easiest part for me. But that doesn’t mean you can’t do it. It’s a grind for a reason. 
---
Snitch
---
Deleting this post. 
---
I don't mind a toxic meta, I do mind when devs refuse to change the meta. As long as I've been playing the game, the meta hasn't changed. They nerf irrelevant stuff, never nerf anything that needs nerfed, and then people wonder why matchmaking times are getting longer.
---
I have like 7 pursuits and pinnacle quests sitting in my inventory that will probably never complete. I do my 5 a week and that's it. I think 4 of those pursuits are all asking for absurd amounts of hand cannon kills. It's flat out boring being expected to use the same gun for hundreds of kills.
---
I don't think they'll change it any time soon. Player base is shrinking fast and they are probably going to release D3 in the next year or so.
---
Closest you'll get currently is the chiapa Rhino.
---
I am not progressing on the last word and would love some tips
---
That’s cool, delete it. The crucible is terrible. What happened the skill in this game sheesh. So weak. 
---
Can't help it if Hand Cannons are the best weapon type  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
---
Boss stomps is just a lazy fight mechanic, you can't change my mind.
---
TLW*
---
And the motivation for both of those to most people was to know the Drifter better. Both quests are given out by him, so of course we'll find out more. Also, vets wanted to have TLW in their hands again.
---
If only the fucking thing would drop
---
\*gobbles all my shards
---
i just want enhancement cores...
---
Even if you're good at the game, it's still an absurd amount of time to spend with one weapon type. There's a reason crucible player base is shrinking; people are BORED. The PvP meta hasn't changed in ages and people are burnt out from grinding hundreds of hand cannon kills.
---
They should buff shards to skulls level 
---
Free orbs 
---
It’s because they have plot armor except for streamers
---
The patch isn't out yet. Will be release with weekly reset
---
Sure! That sounds like fun. Are you on pc? :)
---
This is why the Praxic order wants us dead.
---
Got 50 kills and lost... I LOVE THIS COMMUNITY
---
&gt;but not 1 shot kill from 10 meters.
---
  
---
The only two shotguns capable of doing this are exotics. The Chaperone with an 50% chance to instagib at 13m. Not sure on Acrius LD50, but thats also a heavy.
---
The best rolled legendary shotgun has an LD50 at 8m.
---
Ahahah 
---
1k voices (or any other PvE gun)
---
Me, a PvP player 
---
Toaster are not heavy
---
It takes much less time waiting for an LFG raid post that doesn’t have KWTD in the title than waiting for guided games. Trust.
---
Dont bully Jötunn like that please 
---
I hope bungie dont nerf it before i get it
---
Man screw the Thorn crucible step. 
---
I don’t even mind the PvP steps. Im not great but I usually get a lot of kills per match. I breezed through the ace quest. TLW crucible quest was no problem. Chaperone was laughably easy. 
---
But this is excessive. 4 matches in at 15-20 kills per match with either void HC, kinetic HC, or void ability/super and I’m at 12%. It shouldn’t take 30 matches with 15-20 kills per to complete. 
---
Or about his time as a warlord
---
Placement.
---
Placement. Placement. Placement.
---
Its something you gotta get used to, what you need to do is carve out a niche, a little section of the room, clear it out, make sure you have any snipers down and use the cover to best advantage.
---
Most people doing solo whisper will enter the room, clear a little area as soon as possible then focus on the hard hitters. occasionally they'll swap from dealing with the snipers to making sure their niche of cover is nice and clear.
---
Hawkeye and the First Curse are next.
---
Lmao, you're one of those normies that don't understand not everyone lets their emotions control them and doesn't think about efficiency rather than some stupid emotions that won't get me anywhere. I'm a person that's happy when they're alone and realises that we only have one life which is very valuable. After that life we die. We don't got to heaven, we don't go to hell, all that shit doesn't exist. Going to heaven, being reborn or some stupid shit is just something a lot of people believe in so they have something that keeps them going in life, a lot of people would get depressed if they started looking the truth in the eye. Death is very depressing, if you think about being gone. Some of us can't imagine that, or don't want to. They'd rather believe in some mythical being and place to be happy and say that their life on the earth is just a test or some stupid shit like that. But whatever. I'd rather use my life effectively and try to make a long term impact rather than just wasting it. 
---
You know, we need a heavy hand cannon so you can put a handcannon in every slot. 
---
We also need more exotic handcannons,

I found that this season matchmaking is more fair in terms team composition (fireteams divided between teams and so on). Looks like bungie actually fixed matchmaking (fix mentioned in last or previous patch). However sometimes quality of teams can be better(one of the teams can be all solo luna’s or mountaintop).

In all seriousness though they are cool to hold...

HAPPY CAKE DAY!

What would happen to Izanagi’s burden or Tatara gaze? Would they get their damage ‘balanced’ out too? You seem all nice and cozy in your ward of dawn there bud, sure would be a shame if somebody were to step inside and paint its insides red with YOUR insides using a miniaturised artillery cannon. 
---
20%*
---
not sure about titans or hunters but if you have a warlock, slap on void middle tree, contraverse hold and 5 grenade recharge mods. screw the hand cannons, use a void shotgun like retold tale and make everyone hate you. that's how i completed this step 
---
I'm actually really enjoying in. I've been neither here nor there with pvp until now, having got tired of 4 stacks turning up every other match.
---
The competitive playlist is actually pretty healthy at the moment and i'm getting goodfights(tm) nearly every match. I feel like i'll be kicking ass as soon as i can use my weapons of choice rather than ikelos hc.
---
Oh nice !
---
Thx !😁😁 
---
Curtesy of google slides
---
The link appears to be deleted
---
can they please just stop with the exotic handcannons. It's annoying
---
Are you me? I managed to suffer exactly a single round of comp before losing all patience and heart for the Playlist. Switched back to qp. 75% of the way there. 
---
Tfw the LW quest is still not nerfed 
---
And must use crimson
---
I’m just so far behind at this point, I’ve never played trials because I never had the “good guns”. Plus who wants to play knowing they’re being carried and are the weak link in the team? Haven’t played since black armoury came out, wasn’t ever high enough light to do a forge anyways. Most of the lore was locked behind all those exotic quests that I just watch Byfs vids for the lore content. I’m also extremely fatigued by MMOs right now. 
---
I wonder who got The Last Word? 
---
Yes he enjoys it in a different way, and I’ll be honest I prefer the pve part myself, but he’s saying that people who enjoy the game differently “take the fun out of it” which is the part I have a problem with. But yeah fuck the rng, I’ve been waiting to get a rare bounty to progress the izanagis quest for about a month now 
---
No, I was actually joking about the very “no swears” theme this post has. 
---
Fake or real  I need tooo know?
---
It could be worse...
---
Imagine they force you to get 200 scout rifle kills in crucible
---
I said the same thing 
---
Just play Nathan with a void hand cannon, U’ll get it 
---
And I suck at pvp
---
If you’re not with us, you’re against us, says every villain ever. 
---
Is there an actual difference between the 2 (GF/RSoW) in PvP? 
---
I can't bring myself to do it, keeping it in my inventory for now! I know I can reclaim it but I've still got the space for now. 
---
I was part of that 95% for a long time.  First time someone threw it at me in the corrupted strike  I freaked out because the glow got more violent and I thought it was gonna explode.  Took me quite awhile to realize its just to charge the damn thing.  But too be fair it isn't explained very well in game either.
---
Next seasons called Season of Opulence. Luke Smith said it in the Season of the Drifter vidoc
---
Just pick everything void and play this step as you want. Does not require you to reach some glory rank, does not require to even win games.
---
So you can pick up more than one helm a week? Awesome. 
---
Who?
---
I used to care if those kind of jokes are still funny, but then I took an arrow to the knee.
---
Yup just not at the same time.
---
#LOUD PUNCHING
---
Yeah. The first time I got to do that strike the assholes I was paired up with blazed ahead of me while I was till trying to figure out how to get down there.
---
Which energy sniper are you using? Recently started to learn sniping myself and i see that one on youtube etc a lot.
---
cool compilation btw
---
No there is no crossplay and although i do think it would be great to implement it between the console versions i personally wouldn't want it with the PC port due to different input methods, different settings and cheaters.
---
I went w the Vanguard. Like Cayde said: It's the best bet he ever lost.
---
How *could* you?!
---
This is good news. What are the requirements for the first sentry helm??
---
Kill blockers, Invaders and Primevals
---
I thought I was the only one who missed Outbreak. I have clan members (with whom I grinded out the quest notheless) that barely remember the gun. 
---
Thanks! i didnt know that subreddit! I will check this out.
---
Yeah i do that a lot so think sentry is defo for me. 
---
So true 
---
The helmet stayed on
---
Yep and make it a 1 tap and that you can see it in a cutscene. A single action heavy.
---
Went Drifter, i like the lore and his package 
---
Nice job man! At least your teammates contributed by taking some zones. I always know if I’m having a terrible game, I can at least help control the zones. 
---
Well, Hunter ain't as good as Warlock in PVE. Warlock can also warp/teleport. Hunter mobil is just a small movement and doesn't help with dodging bullet. Titan wise, I've never play them.
---
Happy cake day
---
Go play a tier 1 reckoning with randoms then come back and tell me how it went
---
Same lol my friend and I took turns hiding around the corner while the other got annihilated. I swear I spent more time waiting to respawn than I actually did fighting c':
---
The other day someone did this and at first I got really pissed thinking he was trying to leech then I realized he was cheesing, poor guy forgot to press buttons though and got kicked literally like 5 seconds before we killed the boss
---
Well id be inclined to disagree, looks like I can't convince u otherwise so I'll leave it there
---
Many thanks for all the tips and tricks. It is most appreciated.
---
That’s not how it works
---
I was lamenting the way people run normal strikes. I get the nightfall has to be fast and I don't fault anyone for that.
---
Not even a close comparison randoms can’t make a taken blight heroic, go look at any forums where matchmade groups can’t even do a forge right 
---
Dude no shit lol. Thats the joke. 
---
Its fake lol
---
Play 3 comp matches a week, Monday afternoon/evenings usually being the best time. You’ll get glory points just for playing 3 comp matches a week.  Play at least 3 but keep playing if you’re on a win streak. Once you lose a game outside the initial 3 games stop playing for the week. Can do that until you’re able to find a team at least. It’s obviously a much slower grinding strategy but it will continue to increase your rank overall. 
---
While I'm guilty of it myself, I'm glad action was taken on the exotic posts everywhere. Really crowded the sub with everyone showing they got Luna's
---
The Vigilance Dong is awesome!
---
If they were true hand cannon users there wouldn’t be such a problem with 140s and 150s
---
I had bought the standard forsaken edition and then bought the annual pass separately a month later.
---
*crucible hand cannon kills intensifies*
---
I love it. And I masterworked stability on it. 
---
But, I just got Thorn. So I’ll be using it more. 
---
Slight *CHONK*
---
Thron is at a hard battle with by FF/KC Blast Furnace
---
Older Iron banner shader on default, the shiny one. The sexiest gun alive 
---
Oh wow that's a surprise. The trials weapons were some of my favourite guns in the game. Are they still available anywhere? 
---
I was half expecting someone to comment that
---
TBH Graviton Lance is the GOAT in comp. It's basically a pulse rifle that had babies with a rocket launcher.
---
But breakneck was never good in pvp ?
---
*ikelos hc intensifies*
---
I'd kill for an exotic HC in the energy slot. That would be just wacky fun, and also let me use my bae pulse rifle.
---
100000000% agree
---
yeah i got it done by abusing oversheilds (saint-14 bubbles, defensive strike, tether)
---
I'm a pve player, not good at pvp. Did the quest in the same amount of time you did. I simply hate the crucible, not because I think it's hard or feel entitled, but simply because I don't like it. From that PERSPECTIVE it can be a tedious quest step.
---
TLDR: Learn to put something in perspective before labeling a group of people you clearly don't understand.
---
Nice.
---
Wait for iron banner, when sbmm is back in effect. Anymore, I wait until then to accomplish any pvp requirements for any quest lines. 
---
this or regular hand cannon kills work out, too. slow but relaxed
---
There is no h in woooosh
---
I agree and am In the same boat pursuit wise. 
---
I very much dislike how the vanguard is trying to play everything off as fine or not their problem until it hits the fan.
---
You would rather do TLW again where you lose progress on deaths than this cake walk of a quest? Thorn quest was by far the easiest quest of all the exotic hand cannons lmao
---
SHAGADELIC GUARDIAN!
---
Little tip: sometimes if someone pops a super and you're next to a group of teammates, just crouch behind cover and there's a chance they may walk past you because of the way radar works
---
Im a PvE player too. Crucible sucks I get it. But its a PvP gun right buddy? So if you want it go play PvP. No one wants to listen to you complain just because you do something you dont really like. Dont wanna play crucible? You dont get the gun and you certainly dont get to complain.
---
Yeah I think they went through that process before releasing it, should have specified, my bad. 
---
REEEEEEEEEEE
---
post
---
What if there was a new exotic Pulse rifle that behaved just like the Merciless?  Meaning. .. that it it's rate of fire increased until you killed your target?  And it would be full auto.
---
If you preciously got them in year 1 you can still pull them out of the collections page. Otherwise no, they’re no longer available. Apparently the developers found a game breaking mechanic to trials that was being exploited so they live indefinitely removed it from the game. 
---
Yeha but for the most part the Crucible sucks, even worse when going solo. Just faced a four stack in Quickplay, they were all using Not Forgotten or Luna's Howl and emoted after every kill... If people would stop acting like complete douchebags more people would surely try to get better at Crucible
---
Get a good balance of reserve, ammo finder and scavenger perks (not primary ammo ones) for pve. Some prefer to focus on their heavy and some on their special weapon, really comes down to preference on that one if you ask me.
---
I'm with you, brother
---
Read the rules before posting.
---
It's worth more to me now since Forsaken.
---
Thanks
---
That's an interesting concept. I would like for it to cause another effect when the target dies. Almost like an ambitious assassin effect to stack more rounds so you don't have to reload as much next time.
---
me too!  I run the same and in Reckoning I have had times where I was able to keep a single super up for the entire lenght of the bridge.  It was awesome :D
---
Its not about getting better. You dont have to be good to get thorn. The worst Destiny 2 player in the world could get this gun. Dying doesnt reset any progress so you can sit there and play with your feet and still get the gun. Do something to make the time go quicker while you play like listen to music or get stoned. This quest is insanely easy
---
*Buddy* - You don't have to get passive aggressive with me to get your opinion across.
---
In any case, you're correct on the pvp part, but how on earth can you tell people they are not allowed to complain? 
---
The quest was easy, just time consuming
---
I think that's the problem most people had with the quest
---
Handcannons have always been my favorite weapon type in Destiny but it's time for some other exotics. Like an autorifle.
---
they can catch em, there's just very little homing on those orbs when it comes to allies compared to against enemies
---
Oh yeah forgot about V-wing cause with the catalyst it feels more like an auto.
---
From what I understood, it's an activity that you should be making a fireteam for, and they put matchmaking in there just because people have been asking for matchmaking for all activities including raids (sounds like a bad idea to me).  So basically it's there if you want to gamble and give it a shot, but really the Reckoning is made for a pre-made fireteam. Just what I gathered from what they said, could be subjective.
---
He says stop killing me then get good 😂 
---
Kinetic auto rifle users feel the same. 
---
Like I said, it's only really a problem if more than 1 person leaves. For me at least, it can take up to 4 minutes for a new person to join, pretty much making the round that started in the meantime a waste of time, as too much time has elapsed.
---
Looks like the rise of iron one, about the ogres eye in a hive bunker.
---
Too bad I only see the Better Devils.
---
I can't build any wood structure b/c of my Ringing Nail.
---
I am a great florist, have you seen my Kindled Orchid?
---
Comp is a special place.....
---
Which ones?
---
Hahahah well... you got me there 
---
Can a hunter survive Titan charges?
---
Both are primary weapons. I don't see a problem. It'd be different this was about a kinetic secondary like Threat Level. 
---
The Speaker was a mad lad to death.
---
Never seen one survive it... maybe with 10 resilience u can survive with slither of health
---
Both. But I'm leaning towards Thorn in PvP.
---
installing,  have an upvote.
---
Are you referring to the time he recited the entireyof The Tempest to her from memory?
---
And his helmet stayed on, "the entire time" ;D
---
I've been using Graviton Lance lately. When you get the shots off, it's very, very smooth.
---
Awesome, thank you! I have another update coming out later today with 13+ more emotes, and NPCs. Ghosts are next.
---
gunna put a fat F here
---
No shame in a tactical retreat. Let the sweat stacks fight each other. 
---
Last Word took me three weeks. I cannot stand using a fucking hand cannon, much less a void one. I am never getting Thorn.
---
Also PvE players keep complaining about weapons specific to PvP but they have all the raid weapons and PvP players arent scared to play the raid to get supremacy and other such useful weapons
---
as long as Hawkmoon is still in the pipeline i literally dont care about any other hand cannon from D1. TLW, Thorn, and Hawkmoon were the trifecta of crucible hand cannons. Once these three are all back together they can move on to bringing back my sweet Icebreaker or Outbreak Prime or something like that. 
---
I'd try it, outlaw rampage sounds great It works very well on most things, but I don't have any with rampage so not sure how well it works in various game modes.    
---
My roll is ricochet rounds and range finder so it's super consistent at range but kinda lacks the wow factor of a damage boosting perk. I recently got one with kill clip but I haven't gotten around to trying it yet. Also have the old vendor roll but not a fan of full auto. 
---
I love the gun personally... Gotta make memes tho
---
I've seen Better Devils
---
Honestly they're going to eventually have to acknowledge that some of us just want to lone wolf comp and create a "solo queue only" Playlist. I have exactly zero desire to ever run into a stack for any length of time. 
---
Fucking bruh moment.
---
Maybe the quest was easy for you, you fucking sweat, but not everyone is a sweaty Recluse Howl dickweed. I play Crucible for the powerful gear, nothing more.
---
For real tho. And people will slam through content updates as fast as possible, then complain that they're bored and there's nothing to do. 
---
Then they blame either you or the new people 
---
The one i use has snapshot and rapidhit
---
Iron Banana is what awakened me to the power of Bygones. I had the exact same experience as you where i'd hit them with the initial shot and it would kick upwards into their head. Headseeker is just a nasty perk with a Pulse Rifle.
---
"s u p e r  s w e a t y" PVP
---
Yeah same. I’m mainly a PvE player. I used TLW and Retold Tale and a Hammerhead with Spectral. Just admit you suck ass at Crucible and cant get any kills towards the quest
---
It sucks that there isnt an exotic for titans that after the super ends it doesnt give back a percentage of your super back. Only the sentinel class has an exotic made for it that u can have a long lasting super, but only as long as you keep throwing shields at ads
---
Cerberus+1 is decent, and it doesn't matter if it sometimes loses because it's really cool
---
I had over 16,000 kills on my bad juju. 
---
Bad Juju/warlock Novbomb with obsidian mind was the most insane combo in destiny history!!! 
---
Oofing for comment 
---
It wasn’t hard, just kinda monotonous grinding. I ran the IKELOS hc, Last Word, the Lost Prophecies rocket launcher, and spectral blades. 
---
Haha wow it's not like I say that all the fucking time. I can get some kills, but I'm not a Fortnite pro gamer like you with your drooling meta loadout. I abhor hand cannons, especially Ikelos, so this step is never getting done.
---
Honestly, the entire game isn't very hard. I wish they would make it harder and the quests to get stuff like Thorn even longer. With that though, I would like to see a ton more lore unlocked in the process. The quests should be a long vehicle to unlock more and more about the universe of a game that had a short story.  The hardest part of the whole thorn quest was the strike and FWIW I thought it was a ton of fun.
---
Also git gud. PVP in D2 is a low TTK laggy crapshoot sometimes and I enjoy being awful at it because it means I've got a big hill to climb,
---
Thorn isn't a PvP gun in D2. It's just as effective as a PvE gun, if not moreso. I'm not going to get into the debate on whether it should have a Crucible step to the quest, but let's not pretend that Thorn functions like TLW; its unique perk is tailor-made for killing shitty mobs in PvE.
---
Lmaooooo oh my god. TLW was one of the most grueling things I've ever gone through. I'd rather do Thorn 3x over than deal with losing progress on death.
---
Now, the final mission for TLW? That I could gladly do again. The final strike for Thorn gave me a slight mental breakdown.
---
Yeah, now everyone has to use Luna or Recluse 
---
You make a whole lot of assumptions. And if you hate Hand Cannons why would you want Thorn? Lmao
---
More like Jaren Ward iftaknowwhatimean
---
I got it the minute it came out. Still working on it. 
---
Here's my unpopular opinion:
---
They're hard to obtain and take a lot of grinding.
---
They're supposed to be powerful because of the grind to get them.
---
People need to stop being slaty about not having it.
---
I would like it much more if the mag size and reload was improved AND it took mods.
---
ThOrN iS pVp wEaPoN
---
What are those legs?
---
That loadout makes me want to shoot my head off, jesus christ
---
I completely agree with you, I'm hoping they're left alone,  but with what I've been hearing there's most likely going to be an adjustment unfortunately. 
---
The strike WAS fun. Just a bit annoying with the thralls but it was a great quest step.
---
Thorn is infinitely better than losing progress on death
---
*cries in hunter had no void class at start
---
Well you get the shotgun from the raid and not the forges, so that's probably why.
---
YES!!!
---
As the other person said, the shotgun doesn't come from a frame. 
---
You can tell which guns come from frames by hovering over the first three forges. They will say "you can make (weapon type) and (weapon type) here." Any weapon types not listed on the forges are the raid weapons. 
---
Sorry to do it to you 
---

Whisper is solar singe this week! 
---
I know this is old, but legendary quality (purple) shaders are guaranteed drop on dismantle. Rare quality (blue) shaders are not.
---
No corrupted again? TF is this
---
When's the next iron banner then? A couple people were telling me it was this week for some reason
---
Titans can sword swipe also. Hunters have it the worst😥
---
Same here man
---
Ditto. Annoying as hell
---
she has her feet in the ground for me all the time
---
I think it's far more likely that the frames are in a random rotation. 
---
real ones use nerf gun kindled orchid
---
Still have mine 
---
Shit happens lmao. I’ve had a 56 kill game and the guy under me had 11. We still lost 
---
Ascendant challenge is wrong
---
You're totally missing the point. Even if you're bad you're still taking yourself as some objective standard for difficulty. 
---
Taken to the extreme, you could say that you're making yourself a fundamental part of Destiny 2's game balance. I don't think you're quite that far but you should be wary of the consequences (implications) of making objective statements from your subjective experience. 
---
I can see Bungie fixing that soon... You might find that gets removed from your account because of the Gambit advantage. I doubt they will not let exploits like that stay there forever.
---
I put my God rolled and MW'd Go Figure down the day I got my God rolled Blast Furnace. Things a beast.
---
Never had any problem finding players. LFG through the built-in tool is full of posts every few seconds/minutes.

Destiny is a memory, a cherished gift and a beautiful experience, where I get to talk to and meet new people. The game has been in my life since August 2014 and I couldn't let it go. I met people I never knew or thought I'd meet, talked to people all over. Whether it was just a time waster for them or they cherished such as I do. Anything happens in Destiny will always stay with me forever, same goes for those memories I make. 
---
I’m not going to throw out a perfectly good source of fiber. 
---
He just shot between your legs :) All working as intended
---
Yeet'n with my Jotun

Not this week. I'm sure bungie will tell us when they want us to know, as usual.
---
Thanks!
---
Not judging, but you kiiiiiinda look like a Hot Pocket.
---
Continue...... So ... Sounds like you guys are saying the 5th forge... Is in D1...  Or.... You daying they got this whole idea... And sign... From D1... 
---
My favorite exotic in D2 , the lil toaster makes pve fun :)
---
I received D2 for free from Blizzard, so I joined the community around the beginning of the Season of the Forge. Too many uninviting players. My own clan refuses to walk me through raids. I still have fun with PVE, Crucible, and exotic quests. I’m just saving myself the trouble with having to deal with players who take raids too seriously. 
---
Me who barely played through Destiny One story In D2.
---
Friend: OH MY GOD THE LAST WORD IS COMING BACK!!!!!
---
Me: Oh, whats that?

Thorn released

---
You should all remember: Fall damage only exist on Glass Modifier and Ramps. Beside that fall damage doesn’t exist
---
It feels a lot like the curated Bygones, the one with full auto and Kill Clip. But it would never run out of ammo and increased your Super before generating orbs for yourself was ever a thing. It was one of my favorite guns in D1.
---
This is definitely the guy who always posts these illustrations. Be still.

Ill take it please!!!!

---
OHHHH YEAH that is what happened to my old Ikelos, I had a masterworked solar one that I never dismantled, when they made the change it was gone. I believe I had 2 the solar and a void one, so that may have been why.  I was super pissed but nothing came of it.
---
This post is fine. A lesser mod would not ban him for that.
---
I get you're still learning the ropes, that's fine. But these sort of posts with swearing are fine, people can swear as much as they like unless its directed at somebody.
---
And calling a user a twat *is* the swearing rule you need to uphold.
---
Omfg man why is the corrupted NF so rare
---
Reset gives me mine today. Ill be playing with it when i get off

Bite of the Fox/Lunas - Dawnblade Lock

Totally agree, the void kills are pretty easy if your somewhat decent.
---
Nope
---
As someone who just bought the annual pass when season of the drifter started, this has been torture. I was looking forward to experiencing the black armory weapons, but shes sold the same 4 weapons over the last 3 weeks. 
---
I give it 1 ALRIGHTYs out of 5 
---
No, sorry
---
I may have to try that some time
---
Well u didn't lose the debate... So there's a win
---
I may not of conveyed my point clear enough, the point of the more challenging aspects of these quests to to prohibit bad players from getting the good endgame weapons.
---
Why 200k? 
---
Osprey is random bud
---
Turns out, you are right! It's normally random, but there was a comment by a Bungie employee saying the random part was broken. [Here's some reddit comments referencing the Bungie employee reddit comments](https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/b2zzzl/bungie_are_you_sure_the_ada_rotation_isnt_broken/eiw52ep/)
---
I disagree. They hyped it too much.
---
I’ve used Ursa Furiosa in both PvE and PvP and it’s a shell of its former self. It relies entirely on being passive, and it doesn’t give you any Super energy for being proactive with your Super. Basically, you have to choose between getting a third of your Super back (at the most), or generating Orbs of Light for your team. You can’t have both and that is awful
---
Try branching out a little. Give kinetic auto rifles a go.
---
Yup. That's all we got really...
---
Imagine feeling like you cant try other weapons because you'll miss your crutch that much.
---
I expected more than just one enhancement core man...
---
Osprey is random from any amount, score only effect chance of emblem variants dropping
---
Sorry I must be out of the loop, what's in a week?
---
Everyone's gonna have thorn by then most likely
---
Finally some good fucking food 
---
You’ll get a lot more progress done with the Lake of Shadows, trust me
---
My favorite d1 exotic. It was a fast firing pulse(not the fastest type but 2nd fastest), it had a bit of kick, but it fired full auto and just magically refilled on kills and refilled your super... plus it looked badass. 
---
Ahhh the fate of all AirPod users 👌🏻
---
I've already got it. It's good, can be great in some situations, but it isn't meta changing 
---
if there's any reason to instantly kill cry pod public events, you get  ghost fragments faster by killing, fast traveling, killing if you can find events.
---
But yes, for those of us not in a hurry it is annoying.
---
Yeah but it's good enough to have PvP sweats running it and ruining people's day
---
200 tokens, 200 shards, and 50,000 glimmer total 
---
Let's be honest: that gun isn't very good. It's better in pve then PvP honestly, tho
---

That was the one raid I missed out on. I heard about the first group taking something like a day straight figuring it out and I was like "Nah".

Might not have. The Fissure Knight on Siren's Watch didn't count. Surprised me when the Despoiler Captain did.
---
Im at 26 meatballs and still no title :(
---
When the fuck will I be able to forge another Hammerhead ffs?
---
Through the app and through Amazon Alexa. I can tell my echo dot to equip sets that I have predetermined. So just make two sets with just the weapon being different. 
---
You madman.  You knew you could, but you didn't think if you should
---
In the beginning yes the JuJu was bad but after it was buffed it was amazing in D1!!
---
Didn't do anything like this, but during a countdown match using a devour warlock, managed to win the round killing the 4 opponents after the rest of my team were killed. I hate pvp, but damn did I feel good after pulling that off. 
---
*laughs in golden gun*
---
Wow, that looks amazing. You got some talent.
---
Wow that’s nice, can you please do one of  Anthem Colosus??

/r/fireteams /r/fireteamsPS4 /r/destinysherpa
---
&gt; which includes the annual pass
---
The store shows 3 variants. Digital deluxe edition, Forsaken + Annual pass bundle and Forsaken standard edition. I mean if I buy the standard edition the annual pass is not included, right? Since it's almost an extra 25$ and running till august, I wanted to know if the annual pass will be worth the money. And thanks for the reply. Really appreciate the help. 
---
Some people are hoping destiny 3 is just an expansion to destiny 2 instead of a separate game. Probably won’t be the case though. The game is worth it if you like the grind. I don’t think it would matter if you missed season 1. The seasons revolved around each DLC and brought new gear, missions, locations, and mostly cosmetic items. I’m still getting previous season cosmetics in season 6. I got a transmat effect for my ship from season 2 over the weekend. 
---
The annual pass contains 3 mini expansions. You need it to be able to do forges to get black armory gear. You may need it to play gambit prime, but I’m not sure on that. The third mini pack isn’t out yet. They also have exotic quests that you can’t do with the pass. They keep bringing back old guns and the quests are challenging but you get an awesome weapon afterwards.
---
Tlaloc = Hung Jury's Better Daniel
---
Use D2 app, Discord, PS4 communities or Subreddits.
---
I wouldn't say this subreddit is one for looking for fireteams. 
---
*Our idea
---
$200 cosmetics?  Hopefully never.
---
I never played the original Destiny either, but Detsiny 2 is in a good spot right now. 
---
The annual pass is all end game only, so if you aren't sure if you'll be playing **a lot**, I don't think you need to buy it now. I think the best strategy would be to buy the base game + Forsaken (all pre-annual pass DLC is bundled together with Forsaken), and then if you later on want it, buying the annual pass when it next goes on sale.

---
His reasoning is kind of understandable, he was using two hand canons and he got some unlucky spawns. 
---
I didn’t farm him or anything he was just in my way.  But in all honesty shotguns are kind of nutty, I wish the other close range weapon types were more effective.
---
i cant stop thinking "hot pocket" sounds like something that happens before sex.
---
Both very valid questions. Bungie doesn't go here, but in the other subreddit a Bungie employee commented that the BA frames are supposed to be on a random rotation, but the randomizer doesn't seem to be working. So hopefully it will be fixed soon. 
---
*Every single week* Strange Terrain is not the nightfall, everybody complains about how there isn't Strange Terrain, so I am ambivalent about that one being up for so long. What we really need is The Corrupted, though. 
---
I do believe they're a problem, but making them Bladedancer defeats their purpose. You're supposed to be stealthy, I think the speed of it needs to be slower, and the light attack damage needs to be toned down to at least a 2 hit. 
---
I would say if you have some extra money, go for the one that includes the annual pass, as it just adds more things to do and weapons to get, which is always great. However, if for whatever reason it isn’t in the budget, you wouldn’t be missing too much if you weren’t to get the annual pass. Personally I was in the same boat, I just started working and had to save for everything and had to consider if everything was worth the money, and I have definitely got more than enough content for what I paid for.
---
If you use hand cannons in gambit then yes 
---
Damn that's sleek. You could blind an enemy in the crucible with all that shine.
