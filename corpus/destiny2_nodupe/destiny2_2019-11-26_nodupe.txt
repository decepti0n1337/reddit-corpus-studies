Cool! r/huntersriseup

---
---
thanks for the ptsd
---
Um hello what do you need to do to get the quick fang. Cayde is dead so I don’t how to get him.
---
Oh yeah, with Lucky Pants on especially
---
The AC is basically a solar austringer, the pulse is nasty with a good roll, the sniper is good, the shotty tears, divinity is borderline op, the bow and fusion are kinda eh. How can be fun with WoL but the fusion is just bad imo.
---
The blue bar at the bottom is the video player timeline. This shows how much time is remaining. I'm sorry, please forgive me. Welcome to the game. I hope you're enjoying yourself.  :)
---
Happened to me today, it's weird
---
Not on reddit, in the game
---
It’s better that way
---
Lot idea

M'Fellow Hunter, r/huntersriseup
---
Ooooooh!!
---
Hey man, i have shadowkeep and i do think its dumb. For people who dont know, f2p players can do nightfall the ordeal normally, its just that if the  nightfall is the scarlet keep, you cant play it. So you dont have access to the materials/exotic farm for this week. However, you CAN get the scarlet keep in the strike rotation. I do think its dumb.
---
Double/triple infamy also double/triples your progress.
---
What's under the xbox?

We’re the Titian at
---
Hello, I am friendly Frank
---
I think it is stupid too but Im not really sure of a solution. Im afraid sales would drop if they removed it which would mean pay to win shit.
---
Or maybe they could just chill with the ducking commercials. I own the game and still sees commercials for it.
---
Yea, silver. Everytime u buy one ornament from tess, it reduces the silver price for the full set (I'm sure you've noticed). So my best bet would be to wait and pray if it will go on rotation, or at the last day or week, buy it using silver
---
A ps4 no judge please
---
like the hunter solar knives, but not explosive and its just a book
---
Akka, Eir, Ur, Xol, Yul. From Ghost fragment Gimble-4
---
Currently, Escape Plan feels quite well in that regard.
---
Ah good, the only place they belong!
---
Self revive was the bee's knees.
---
It definitely would be good in Crown of Sorrow, the whole way through. And the Levi-Raids.
---
My brother bought it with him to All-State band. Sorry if I didn’t provide context at the title, I was busy and didn’t have enough time to make a title.
---

---
Edit: It was a dare that our trumpet section leader made with my brother.
---
Couldn't upvote because then it would go to 7.0k but I have to say this is the best Ghost shell recommendation I know.
---
I mean, you dont have to do it. Dont do it if youre lazy, but at the same time theres nothing wrong if you want to do it. Theres really no right way to answer this lol.
---
In the TWAB they said that the effects of us defeating the boss haven’t become apparent yet so I’m assuming something big will happen before the end of the season.
---
For the hord?
---
Well, if you bought curse of osiris, you did.
---
AND THEY TASTE FUCKING DELICIOUS
---
Dont knock it till you've tried it.
---
It’s more of a principle thing. Anyone willing to wear something that ugly doesn’t deserve the Light of the Traveler
---
I mean you can. Not gonna do much good
---
I wish I was that lucky between that and translation theory but I should correct myself and say forsaken berengers memory was the vanilla gL I got spammed by at rahool
---
I don’t necessarily mean that bc of power level they’re bad I just meant that they’re new with sucky gear
---
with or without master of arms and the other thing the recluse is still the best smg
---
I still want to know why 100k doesn’t offer a new emblem
---
its just fan canon i can dream about it :((
---
Lawl

Once you hit the level the game thinks you belong in, you’ll lose glory on losses. Even then it takes a loss streak to see any significant drop.
---
"So I start blastin "
---
Well.. we were all there once.
---
Played with a guy last night that was(according to destinytracker) playing his 3rd game ever of comp.
---
SBMM is wildly broken and makes for some ludicrous matching.
---
Um, you mean steam... Stadia wasn't available on shadowkeep launch.
---
I feel like i'm the only one who liked the Mandalorian yet still felt that line was cheesy.
---
Thanks! 36 stressful attempts earlier and I'm so happy we finally did it.
---
Then we would need a Ghost that would look like a potato
---
Oh I see that all the time. I really don’t get it. I’m no PVP god but at least I know not to try to bumrush a full team. Even barely peaking a lane at the wrong time is a death sentence in comp.
---
Upload it to your profile, download the Xbox mobile app on your phone, share the video to the website of your choosing, copy link to here
---
Ah, i love homophobia winding its way into gaming like it’s 2005
---
Here is what I use:
---
Revoker + Recluse + Peacekeepers. This lets you snipe enemies with no repercussions. If you miss, switch and you get your bullet back plus you switch almost instantly. If you hit body, boom just switch and finish them off instantly. If you hit a headshot, boom you’re done. Peacekeepers auto-reload your stowed SMG so you never have to worry about switching with not enough ammo. Peacekeepers aren’t the most amazing exotic and they aren’t considered all that good when you can just use One Eyed Mask but I hate anyone who uses it and don’t want to be a part of that cancerous scourge.
---
Code of The Aggressor (bottom tree) Void Titan + Magnetic Grenades + Oppressive Darkness (mod for your mark). From this you get one hit kill grenades, sometimes this doesn’t register especially against laggy opponents.
---
My armor is started for 6, 6, 3, 4, 3, 4 but this doesn’t really matter.
---
Looks like you were actually hungry for more.
---
The wins are separate from the rank. You should be able to Knock this out with Iron Banner this week!
---
I would love some more voice packs to make our ghosts unique. Get some famous people, aome crossovers etc. 
---
I've had the headcanon that my guardian allowed his ghost to be overwritten by Rasputin so me and Ana could work on golden age tech. Reasons the sleeper is still my favorite weapon, as well as wearing the full BrayTech Researcher set.
---
Sooooooo.......shall I call a wahm-bulance?
---
Recluse still has a &lt;1sec bodyshot ttk from handcannon ranged by the way. Also, Recluse is EXCEEDINGLY easy to get regardless of how good you are. But you complain about the Nerf still. Even so, all you have to do is land easy-to-land crits to attain original damage numbers.
---
*Happy Russian noises*
---
*Happy ~~or not so happy~~ Irish noises*
---
Also, we got a damn glowing rock as a Ghost, so why not?
---
Ii still use it.  At least I will after I finish the throwing knife...
---
That's what I plan to do the next couple weeks. Just helped my best friend tonight with his triumph chase, but I wanna spread the love and help random people when I have time. I'll be hitting up r/Fireteams to help soon enough.
---
That was before the seasonal model and the Dreaming City was honestly more of a living story than anything we got this season.
---
Dude, I want a poncho. :(
---
The Suros Modular Shine shader is the exact shader the Recluse uses by the way. It looks hilarious with it on.

---
Gunsmith and strike bounties every day ought to be more than enough. Get them all done while you run strikes/NFs and it will be easy. 
---
Always have bounties working. If you’re in a social space, grab patrols. Equip a shell with Guiding Light.
---
Yeah . . . I'll just repeat myself. I just wanna know how they justify the matchmaking. I have yet to be put in a competitive match where my shit wasn't stomped so hard I felt like I must've forgotten how to use a mouse.
---
Hey man I’m sorry ppl are downvoting you, I agree even though I’m a hunter
---
Dude idk why but is that the mission version of that strike it’s hard af even with 3 ppl
---
Ha. See the thing is I'm 13 and at my age there's this this called money that I don't have, and I can't get because I legally can't get a job.
---
White lantern
---
A dude in my schools bookstore has a tattoo of that
---
Absolute legend
---
Top tree dawnbringer got a buff, warlock movement fir everything else got a nerf...
---
Ok now I think Rick is a crayon eater. Worst name ever.
---
Yeah because we absolutely need Yet Another 140rpm Handcannon
---
#Excute order 6#
---
Yes they did haha
---
They nerfed the way desperado works in pve, but the whole heavy hitting pulse archetype got a buff so it’s actually easier to use in pvp now as long as you’re accurate.
---
This is with the substitutional alloy robes, so you'd have though it was able to do it properly, but with any age of item it seems to be just the first infusion works with glimmer, then after it's upgrade modules
---
It will still scale on level after you’re high enough above 750
---
As agile in death, as he was in life.
---
There's still like 6 old raids people run for armor, menagerie, Gambit, patrol destinations, strikes, old NFs, reckoning, Gambit prime
---
None of those need weapon artifact mods
---
Don't act like artifact mods magically boost a weapons damage by 99999%, all they do is bypass some enemies previous immunity "phases" (hobgoblins and Hydra shields) and allow you to deal with champions in 3 activities, one of which, the seasonal activity, that is so pathetically easy you don't need them at all for, and for all NFs besides master difficulty ones and Garden of Salvation, you can easily kill champions without them, one shot them with izanagi, burst DPS with a shotgun/gl or just knee them with peregrine greaves
---
The only true benefit is allowing for grenade spamming builds, everything else is just some good QOL features if anything
---
People are mad because LFG acts very pissy for GoS and NFs and forces people into using things they don't want to run, people want to use sunshot, let them do so without being handicapped or being a detriment to the team
---
Really the only exotic primary that doesn't have that issue is Monte Carlo and only if you run it with peregrine greaves for every 950 and below NF because you one shot everything there
---
There's this thing I did at the age of 13 and my parents gave me an allowance, it was called chores, I also walked around the neighborhood and mowed lawns for $20 a piece.
---
Complete repost
---
Go too far
---
You need to play non competitive first, and I don't mean just a few times I mean A LOT before you move on to competitive, find a build that works for you, get really good with it then move to competitive, and always stick with someone else from your team, helps a lot
---
I've found this with my brother one day. Very odd
---
It just kept getting better.
---
Someone did put a link....
---
I’m going to miss Monte Carlo thunder coil and peregrine grieves and shoulder charge combo in pve after this season.
---
Like quit d2 yeah alot of people did lol
---
You are completely right this has been done to death on this post and this guys is probably the 100th person to post this exact image
---
🙏🏻
---
As a warlock. I appreciate the purple megayeet at the end there, this is beautiful
---
Even if it's not interesting or original, that doesn't mean it's wrong.  If anything it proves how much of a concern it is to the fanbase.
---
Right, but just in general. I think special ammo needs some big changes. Like... It's an issue to pick up 7-8 shots from one brick of green. Special ammo just duplicates and duplicates as the game goes on thanks to scavenger perks.
---
I'm getting tired of all of the one shot kill weapons and abilities in the game in general.
---
The way I see it, you shouldn't stat the game with special, and if you have a special weapon equipped when you die, you should drop 1 round. 2 rounds if the person who picks it up has a scavenger perk. The amount of ammo that the person was carrying upon death doesn't matter. It's always 1 or 2 shots.
---
#40 Bounty added to Whiterun
---
Bungie: Bob can you buff shoulder charge please? Jesus Christ jerry you would think the team would know by now how this works...
---
Don't get me wrong, I understand Zavala's viewpoint in regards to chasing down Uldren. There is *always* danger when a Guardian leaves the City, especially without a fireteam. It's still annoying that he really thinks that a handful of corrupted fallen captains and a very mortal awoken man are a serious danger to the player Guardian after everything else that one has faced. Seriously, ***we have killed literal gods***.
---
As much as I love his character and hated to lose him, Cayde was *careless*. Pirrha was waiting for him to call out his Ghost. The rifleman had had plenty of opportunity to take the shot on Cayde and instead he saved that shot for poor little Sundance. Our Ghost knows better, **especially** after what happened to Cayde and Sundance. I'd say our chances of success are pretty good, especially with Petra on our side.
---
I’m not saying that’s how I want pvp to be. It’d just be an interesting take on pvp, and I’d be fascinated to see what kind of meta may emerge in that kind of mode
---
This seems to be a common thing on this strike, it happened to me twice.
---
It scales 20 light behind. If you are 950 light, exotics pulled from collections will be 930 light. (I did it the other day and that's how I know)
---
I would like a weapon with mini-nuke and ammo regeneration. I am a very lazy guardian
---
I like the yellow ones because they taste like bananas
---
*jumps 4 inches snapping ankle, breaking 4 vertibre, 3 ribs, left leg, and shatters skull*...I hate rocks...
---
*Skydives from space, landing face first, getting up without any bodily damage minus a scratch* Nice!
---
All good man.
---
Also, light is based on your actual light or your light level before the artifact is applied. So you can be light 960 with an actual light level of 950 so gear drops will center around the 950.
---
Unless your team is very coordinated which it isnt the case with pubs usually, that unstoppable orge or a barrier tanky as fuck champion would immediately halt your run. 
---
Heck you cant even complete vex offensive without those mods, you’d be at risk of not getting chests from times events.
---
Are you below 2.1k? For me comp got way more reasonable after 2.1k. System took a long time to figure out my placements.
---
I wouldn’t recommend outrageous fortune because it can only hold 5 in a mag compared to t he 6 on other grenade launchers. That can make a big difference considering how much damage 1 spike grenade can do.
---
It's worth it completely. I ignored your whole story because idc but I saw you ask if it's worth it.

Still remember the commercial for D2 and thinking to myself *I like that guy, I might actually want to see what that game is all about*

I wanna see a shotgun with Killclip, it would be the stupidest thing ever.

I've heard that, but no, I'm not, and unfortunately it doesn't seem to have gotten easier.

Bruh just use a backup plan Erentil

I only play gambit when my friend is on and every time we do out of 10 games there is a good chance we will both get kicked in a few of those games. Also this only happens in gambit prime.

Because in this season they're using the seasonal mod? I mean hunters still have the best neutral game and when the nerf to OEM comes live I don't know what hunters are gonna argue with, hunters are always throwing shit to titans just because for a single year since destiny 1 they haven't been the best class on pvp

It took me 30 seconds to read this comment

God, graviton shreds people who try to fight you at range. I don't even have the catalyst and got my first efficiency over 6 this past weekend. Wasn't even using OEM. Just hung back and had me a feast. 
---
2 of my team mates saw me popping off and just started luring gunfights into my kill zone.
---
No, it's not a bad gun (at least imo). It just drops WAY more than most other stuff does.
---
Guess I'll add this to the list
---
I upvoted but fatebringer or any of the Atheon weapons would be magnificent as well.
---
As a (mostly) gay hunter, it had a bit of a sting, not gonna lie.

Everything can be done in less than a week
---
Destiny going F2P was the tiping point for me, now its free they have all the excuses to be able to add more and more payed content, despite the game originally being 60 dollars + like 3-4 dlcs that are full game price
---
Teach me senpai! I am the worst warlock to ever grace a pvp fireteam
---
So basically what you are saying is, hunters have been crying over OEM for a year cause of the overshield and now that bungie is taking it away, you want to have the overshield?
---
You got your confirmation email that it’s shipping?
---
fucking hate how companies are so desperate for money that they will elongate the release of finally good star wars media to multiple weeks despite the fact that there is literally no reason to do it
---
You gotta shoot their gun!
---
I was losing my mind on this too. You need to aim and shoot his glowing gun. When there are multiple one the order they spawn in is the order they will attempt to shoot you in, hope this helps!

Ugh so dramatic, yes the gun needs a nerf but it isn’t that bad
---
Shadowkeep is 90% recycled content and even then it doesn't even begin to scratch what Forsaken had to offer. People are annoyed due to the drastic drop of quality in pretty much everything but the Eververse, the living story is a massive failure, the timegating makes people stop caring about going after things and as soon as season ranks start being sold for silver everyone who didn't get the chance to finish the pass will feel even more annoyed. There are just a ton of issues right now and nothing that implies it will get better anytime soon.

---
Just do it, it’s pathetic to not have it at this point tbh, comp will practically hand it to you for free because of matchmaking.
---
Because that's their thing. They don't have dodge, invis or a rift.
---
Last Word Quest - last step - quickdraw gunfight against 1, then 2 then 3 enemies - with small add clears in-between each.
---
The enemies indicate/glow just before they "draw" and you aim for their ARM/HAND!
---
When you get to the pair/triplets - they draw in the order that they spawn in - so shoot the arms in that order.
---
The triplets can spawn in any order 1-3 left-right, middle first, 1-3 right to left etc.
---
1 bullet per enemy or you'll run out of time.
---
Put on Hand Cannon dexterity/handling mods if you have them.
---
Maybe drop your sensitivity lower (on controller) as that may make it easier to flick between the enemies.
---
Good luck.

My fuck hunters bit? I’m sorry about that then. Just a bad joke to try and be less of a buzzkill. 
---
If you’re referring to the homophobia within this thread then yeah it’s just so uncalled for. Whenever I see this stuff I just think “damn... imagine being a gay destiny fan going about your day, trying to enjoy some content about the video game you like, and STILL unable to escape this hateful bullshit” 
---
So idc about the internet points I lose, I seriously think to myself “well hopefully that person will at least see me not standing for it.”
---
I know that feel but as the the saying goes "fuck this guy in particular"
---
Oh the hunters thing doesn’t sting at all. I know I’m a pain.
---
Yea that’s what I was thinking too
---
Any tips?
---
No, unfortunately it seems like they removed them at some point.
---
I have one of those and I really hoped they were going to keep making more intricate one like the ones we have in game now.
---
I get how people dont like shadowkeep being alot of "recycled" content, in my opinion it feels more like reused content that was freshened up, but I dont know, I liked shadowkeep, but bungie dosent have the money backing from Activision anymore, and if I know one thing about game development money=time and time=quantity, so because of bungie not having the money from Activision anymore, they dont have as much time to an extent, wich is why the eververse store is needed, so bungie can try to get as much money as possible, because most of it will go straight back into the game. For example if bungie has more money they can have people work overtime, without the extra money they couldn't, that's why shadowkeep was delayed and still had less content then forsaken, bungie doesn't have the money, Activision leaving was a double edged sword
---
10 minutes and one second*

yea, trusting ur friend too much, campagins dont give exotics anymore

Congrats brother I’m trying to get there now I’m at mythic 2. It’s taking me forever I can hold my own is just some people are just better than me haha
---
Absolutely no problem with Stadia, no lag, graphics smooth as my ps4 and 60 FPS. Also much much shorter loading times. It’s connexion based so maybe check your network as the system is not faulty always
---
Huh I don’t have a good bow yet. I could go get Leviathan’s Breathe in a few hours. I’ll give it another shot tonight or tomorrow
---
That's why people need to watch videos and read reviews before playing. Cloud based games are going to have flaws compared to the hardware people are used to. That's to be expected
---
His ass still hurts when he sits down.

---
Not the best by a long shot sorry kackis
---
Then don't trust anyone.
---
6v6 playlists are connection based above everything. 3v3s offer better sbmm, but itll still match you against 4k glories pretty consistently.
---
who gives a shit that's the loading screen
---
Depends on your connexion id say, I have a fiber French connexion and no lag 60 FPS constant, same graphics as ps4 or even slightly better, plays like a charm on chromecast or chrome, the super nice thing is super short load times, like 15 secs to get from tower to spawn on moon... downside is server population but as game is free it can only get better!
---
A thing.
---
commoners dont do that my friend 😂
---
Are you ProuD oF tHiS cOmMuNiTy?
---
I had a few matches yesterday where the opposing team just waited for us to get a prime evil and then endlessly invaded on a rotation. Until they crippled our team through attrition so.much that their one guy getting motes summoned their prime. 
---
Finally just started ignoring everything else and hunting em everytime they invaded. You better believe I tea bagged every corpse. They knew what it be.

There should be a whole nether section that you missed, if my memory is working for once.
---
Us too doo doo doo do doo
---
If you join a clan with casual players who dont play that much youll get the bonusses for a clan but you are not expected to join every clan activity. And just do things like vex offensive or nightmare hunts for prime engrams
---
No i love running the exact same encounter that's the same as the previous encounter a billion more times desperately trying to get final shots in with my hand cannon before some dude runs by and nukes the room with his super :P and then i can work on bows!!!
---
Deal with it. Malfeasance is great.
---
Nothing is going to change. Something else will take the blame.
---
There is never too much exotics, so try to get everything from xur that you don't have. Who knows, maybe you will never get that exotic again.
---
The second e is missing in escape
---
Agreed, they have every type of enemy that I hate: swarms of people on suicide watch (and is the fastest of said type), enemies with physical shields that somehow deflect bullets, and Arc Chieftains.
---
I know I called out Arc Chieftains in particular, because there is nothing scarier in the game than getting pinned in place while there's an Invader running around.
---
But then he got chewed up by a giant space butthole, so I guess the joke's on him.
---
What a great comment this is. /s
---
or sideways!
---
If you're a warlock you can reload with Transversive Steps and still get the medal.
---
Weird post to feel good about not getting an easily unlocked weapon. Much of human psychology is about self-esteem management. I hope this works for you.
---
Incorrect
---
I mean, what do you want me to say? You cant teach practice. Quit Bitchin and just play. Or Dont, nobody's making you play PVP.
---
...which is entirely Bungie's fault. They made this system. They're literally punishing people for doing either one thing or the other. They need to wipe it all out and come up with a system that rewards both.
---
One, radar is for bad players. We all see your kind just prefiring because your bad. Radar in no way should be in a game like this. Two, hand cannons, certain scout rifles, pulse rifles all can one shot. It is pvp it should be competitive not dumbed down so you can just click for a kill with zero ZERO skill. Same goes for supers, you should be immuned during activation or just spam left click to get kills.
---
I mean it's amazing for pvp and pve so yeah I'd get it
---
I dont really know what you mean,
---
If you mean why do I want to mainly for the cool armour, and also I paid I want my money's worth

The YouTuber for 9 year olds. When will he go 4K.
---
OP is talking about Leviathan. You can run that with blues. 
---
Sounds like you’re talking about GoS, which can be completed with any good loadout. There was a video last week of 5 Hunters and a Titan doing the whole third encounter with abilities only. I’ve led my team in DPS with a DARCI. You can do plenty of DPS in the boss encounter with a Tranquility and one of a half-dozen grenade launchers. 
---
And of course: any LFG team is well within their rights to ask for whatever they want. It’s their game too. 
---
But don’t let that stop you from just making stuff up and exaggerating and crapping salt all over the place. “State of the r/ ladies and gentlemen!”
---
I got the last Rumble Match done last night as well, except I thought that was the last thing. Once I got the "do seven thousand bounties" thing I swore out loud and went to bed. This better be the best weapon ever.
---
There is no such this as too many exotics aka buy new one when xur sells them

I have multiple uses.

Vibrator is in fact one of them.

ok

I did, but he had a stroke just this Saturday and there was no recovery. I'll miss that little shit doing this to me. Hug your cat for me, and give him a good shout too lol.
---
Considering it's MIDA MULTI-Tool.
---
I'm pretty sure one of those "tools" could be used for that rule.
---
love the aesthetic! color scheme works really well with the style of armor you have equipped. your loadout seems awesome and lethal, I'd hope to spawn with you in crucible rather than against you!
---
Haha thank you so much! Maybe someday 👀
---
Bygones is more of a dad rifle than any other one because it's more forgiving than a 4 tap,are and easier to use than most
---
I remember year one of destiny 2, that was a reality. Only supers and heavy ammo weapons (which included specials at the time) could one shot. No ability could kill in one instance of damage. They must have changed it for a reason.
---
What’s yo brothers
---
Lol howww this wqs tooooo easy
---
Garden of salvation raids with inexperienced players takes like 3-4 hours. Of course I am super willing to wipe 3-4 hours with 3 characters per week. This is only 9-12 hours just running garden and having a super fun time. I know, because Sunday have spent 8 hours teaching new players. 
---
Last Wish is probably one of the longest raids by the way. The puzzle at Shuro Chi encounter, doing Riven without cheese, yeah, that takes even longer than garden.   
---
No, no, you guys that don't have any clears just paint it like everyone who wants a fast, relaxed raid is an asshole. And at the time we got our experiences you were probably chilling, leaving all the work to figure things out and practice to us. 
---
Don't like my tone? I take my time teaching raids to newcomers nearly every week. Because I think giving back and teaching is as important as grabbing loot. The only thing I don't like about raiding are people throwing temper tantrums, because they feel entitled to be taught by everyone.   
---
How about the following: "LF5M chill and patient people who want to do the Last Wish raid. I have not done it yet, but I checked the videos and I am confident enough to tell you about the encounters. If there are experienced people up for helping us out, this would be very heartwarming."
---
I literally had a clanmate tell me "yeah, I did not watch the videos you suggested, can't be arsed to watch a 20 minute long video"
---
Was in matchmaking.
---
I was wondering if this is "good enough" for me to buy Shadowkeep. Googling whether Shadowkeep is worth it led me to this subreddit, where I see opinions range from "yes, it's more Destiny 2" to "no, completely not worth it", with very little in between.
---
If it matters, I love the Destiny 2 campaign and lore, but hate grinding for gear score, which was why I stopped playing Destiny 2 after completing the initial campaign. I do have Forsaken (from the Battlenet Launcher days), but hadn't played through it yet due to the aforementioned lack of gear score. And I only just recently cleared out enough HD space for the 105GB HD space requirement for the game, and was considering re-installing it.
---
So with all that, is it worth getting Shadowkeep (Digital Deluxe also a possibility) at this price?
---
That’s what I thought as well. It’s gotta be Sugarhouse
---
That doesn't work with Kackis vids though.
---
Just close your eyes and hope for the best
---
Luckily OEM doesn't work in supers
---
Nah your just trash don’t blame the game mode, bungie literally made it for everyone and is great atm, I got legend + my unbroken seal in 3.5 hours on the second day of shadowkeep lol dont even blame the game mode
---
That's what usually happens, even more often now that you don,'t get health on kills. When we get lucky and find a full spawn of people, people get mad.
---
Or maybe he has a kid or young relative?
---
Yeah, that’s what I did.
---
“Weapons are my religion”
---
“My fists are all I need for blunt force trauma”
---
Huh, havent thought about that. Now I want to have a empty round.
---
I have the context, but where I was working the other day had almost no signal, and I had to rush the post.
---
Well, you can't ask for a refund. You already used the codes, and all that, so is too late now.
---
I'm not sure if I'm relieved or upset that I'm not the only one who came up with this. The only difference is that for me it's 'daddy shaxx do do do do'
---
The vast majority of the Bungie Pls(Tm) posts are pretty unrealistic and written without considering the issues or resources involved in implementing what they're suggesting, but that definitely doesn't mean this season has been *good.*
---
Somebody grab the pitchforks and torches.
---
I got it next to the pillar.
---
So true
---
Titan main since D1 beta. For the most part, titans are only good for mobbing. So feel free to run whatever. If you want team utility, run top tree Sentinel for weapons of light, or top tree Sunbreaker if you want a balance of mobbing, and team utility (melting point)
---
I’ve been pretty bored lately for exactly that reason. What’s the point in grinding anything when I already have the best stuff that’s been the best for the past year? Sure, not by such a long shot anymore, but still the best.
---
I got my shiny yellow guns this season, I’m in college now and I have other stuff to focus on, so Destiny officially has to compete harder for my attention. For a lot of people that’s just how it always is, and tbh, Destiny doesn’t have a sustainable gameplay loop for me. I might drop in early in the season for neat stuff, but the end is just grinding for guns I’ll put in the vault, with rolls I already had.
---
Tl;dr, yeah if I’m going to really grind for something at this point in time (college &amp; engaging in society and such), it has to be something actually cool. Not just a shiny, Vexy sniper or a heavy bow with less utility than most primaries. Or like you said, make more things viable. It’s a shame all those neat guns I used to grind for *do* just sit in my vault.
---
This guy is simply a clickbait annoying idiot
---
Don't worry, Recluse is still smack dab in the middle of a dad loadout. No need to hide your kids.
---
Then they’re mega bitches and a disgrace to this community to boot.
---
Trust me, you did nothing wrong
---
I thought this was actually a striker hidden perk.
---
Depends. Do you want to quit, do you want your enemies to quit, or do you want your teammates to quit?
---
Try using a hand cannon that uses primary ammo. You'll never run out of bullets
---
Missing a “do”.
---
nice
---
I won't miss it... I am a Warlock. Who in his right mind would think it is a good idea to buff Titans and Hunters so heavily? I don't care about PVE... let them be monsters, I have teammates who profit from it, but in PVP it is just annoying.   
---
Titans don't even try to shoot any more, they just run at you, trying to melee you.
---
They had hinted that there was going to be a "catch up", but haven't elaborated since.
---
Last words?: Mara lemme smash
---
Jesus dude lmao thanks you didn't really need to re-upload for me
---
*YOUR ENEMY CAN'T KILL IF THEY'RE DEAD*
---
Depends on which attributes you like really. I found some Void gloves with 21 Recovery and 23 Disciple while I was leveling.
---
Needless to say I have never taken them off and I'm 977 light now
---
You two be like "Let them fight, let them fight"
---
Please, mercy
---
Somebody already lewded whisper of the worm
---
Yes, luck is involved.  When I lost two in a row I quit for the night or I returned to orbit for a few minutes to try to mix up the player pool.  As an average player I got my NF last week.  What else I noticed is what time of day I played comp.  The sweats were more active during the day.  At night, the player pool was more vague.
---
This changes everything
---
Recluse lw and shaperone can't be equiped at the same time
---
Ok thank you :)
---
You switched your controller layout my guy
---
Wait you could snipe with the LoW? 0\_0
---
If they do like previous seasons, holding bounties like that won't get you any power levels. They will be capped at the current power cap.
---
Now holding them for XP for the new artifact will be good. You can unlock the bonus power and artifact mods faster that way.
---
YOU TALK MAD SHIT FOR SOMEONE IN MOUNTAINTOO DISTANCE
---
This is the way.
---
Its just weird I've been playing the same lay out since d 1 and then thisn happens outta nowhere.
---
I'm on xbox btw
---
So many people hate on kinderguardians, I matched up with one from LFG  and had a blast with our 10 or so 950 ordeal runs. It is refreshing talking to someone who is so impressed with the game and the mechanics and cosmetics and what not instead of hearing the same old Titan/recluse/mountaintop/exotic drop rate complaints.
---
The popcorn emote is perfect.
---
Well, snipe is probably a bit of an exaggeration, but it could outrange hand cannons when the perk was activated, and it was a one hit kill. It still hits hard, but now its range is more appropriate for a shotgun.
---
1k ;/
---
Hi, fellow Utahan.
---
As someone who's sherpa'd a ton of groups through last wish, it isn't just the sherpa that breaks down. Everyone gets tired, they don't pay as much attention, and thus don't remember what to do when it comes to it. This discourages everyone including the sherpa, especially if it's one or two people that are constantly causing wipes.
---
It's a long raid, and a lot of people just simply aren't prepared for it to take that long.
---
So that freelance competitive? You can't join that with a team. Everybody is randos in there.
---
I went through like every option. From the moment I got to choose my character it was using the right joynstick instead of the left.
---
It doesn't say anything about forsaken, will I not get that dlc?
---
Why do you need recluse?
---
Considering mount top "grenades" travel infinitely...
---
Yea... Hard not to be in mountain top distance ..
---
Yeah I have realised that but the pattern seems to have changed of late so I’m not too sure what’s going on with who’s on when! It probably was not a good idea that I continued to play after a couple of losses which resulted in me losing about 6 games in a row almost twice and I think just the constant loss of points really put me down. I’m going away for the rest of the week so hopefully when I come back I’m fresh and rested and by that time all the people who are rushing to do stuff with be playing so I can hopefully farm them! Congratulations on getting the gun btw!
---
When the whole enemy team is taking C me with my striker super “this is about to get interesting”
---
I thought this was pc gameplay to be honest
---
You can just say no, /s
---
Not gonna lie, I had to read the title 4 times before I understood what you wanted to say.
---
Means u have all the abilities bought for it
---
Ooooo...it be like that sometimes.
---
This is for after someone who has izanagi. If you’ve not got izanagi, Whisper works good as well using a spike grenade Militia’s birthright grenade launcher for when you’ve potentially got no whisper ammo left. But subtle calamity is pretty much God for that encounter when it comes to solos. I wish you luck, and that, if you fail time and time again, to take a break and come back another time. It’s not easy.
---
It means you did the quest line thing to get the middle tree for the super
---
I’m dumb you were right haha thank you
---
Hey thanks
---
Knight boomers as well. Fallen probably are touch better because you also have the bonus of being matched to Captain shields, but Fallen and Hive are like 1a and 1b for me. Cabal is hit or miss, and there are some Taken that do Arc damage. Vex suck because you need Fanatics. I don't remember if Scorn have much Arc either.
---
cat: put down the controller hoomen thus i have ascended
---
Yea, and usually the boss will focus you when meleeing so for me its, get in hit 2 punches. Boss stomps and shoots me dead while i am still flying from stomp..
---
The Acolytes use solar a lot, both with grenades and that spread shot weapon that they share with Knights
---
At this point I’m starting to think that people simply copy and paste the same picture over and over.
---
Am I missing something here?
---
Lol. And thrall.
---
I’ll try to be brief and helpful at the same time.
---
Let’s begin with the fact that now season may have activities/quests/badges/triumphs, which won’t be available next season. (Such as Vex Offensive rn)
---
The 40$ pass gives you complete access to all seasons: current one and future ones, plus you’ll also earn “premium” contents (like anticipated or exclusive exotics, or legendary set, cosmetics and so on).
---
The 10$ pass gives you access to that season you’re paying for, ex: 10$ for Undying, 10$ for Dawn et cetera) and perhaps gives you premium content, but I’m not 100% sure about it.
---
nah those graphics are way too realistic. The blue light from the game is hurting my eyes. Turn the brightness down pls kthxbye
---
Not commonly. Vex only do when there are Fanatics.
---
I beg the thrall to slap me, so that I can end them all at once
---
This has been a thing since day 1. It's very clear that exotics are intentionally unshaderable to sell ornaments, but even if they wanted to change that now they cant because of the potential shitstorm of people demanding refunds for now worthless ornaments.
---
Risk runner on escalation protocol is cum
---
ok no
---
A wise decision
---
Nightfalls?
---
I am suitably impressed.
---
For some reason I only run recluse/MT on my Hunter but I do love me an smg. My warlock’s standard load out is riskrunner/loaded question/wendigo and my Titan’s is Monte Carlo/one two punch shottie/outrageous fortune. I’m actually looking forward to the nerd in some ways - will make me use my outlaw/demolitionist  every waking moment for devour and every other smg that isn’t recluse or risk runner.
---
All while rolling an arc subclass
---
I don't think you get 3, do you? I tried it once and didn't get three.
---
I'm so bad at PvP that OEM's tracker barely levels the field for me.
---
*wiggles fingers*
---
they spawn where there are nightmares as lost sectors bosses/minibosses.
---
dont know if now all bosses are nightmares but the one in the picture is for sure one
---
I've been at high rank comp for almost a year now, and I can say with confidence that a class doesn't matter as much as a good subclass and a versitile loadout. Every class has a strong subclass.
---
Titans also aren't underpowered in pvp. They have arguably the best pvp exotic in OEM and some really solid zoning grenades. I wouldn't call them overpowered too, except for OEM.
---
If you want to play titan for pvp the only thing differenr you have to learn is how to move well with them and good barricade placement. Without making this too long, barricades aren't only for securing heavy. They can also be used to force the enemy into bad positions.
---
It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
---
"We will see" my ass. We already know about the nerds.
---
Yes, but that damage is not remotely identical is what I'm saying. I expected it to be as the stat numbers are all within +-2 between the two of one another. My tranquility has high impact reserves, so the first 3 shots in my mag have no buff (appended + backup mag, so 7 rds) If it takes 2 crit shots to drop a target with izanagi's vs 1 with tranquility, while having less reserves on hand then it is really at a disadvantage in the I guess "middle game" in PVE.
---
With honed x4 procced, yeah it'll bang out more damage, but that also means I'll be carrying 2 weapons exclusively for bosses, with nothing to handle the more dangerous ranged enemies or majors effectively.
---
I'd rather not see your ass Mr. Castle.
---
FOR THE PUPPIES
---
The other night he just straight up screamed after I got like a double kill. I couldn’t stop laughing. Love Shaxx
---
Um...you missed 2.
---
Huh?
---
Hmmm.  Have you done all of her memory quest?
---
My response was because that guy pops up like herpes and posts some edgy stuff wherever I post. I’m not going to act like this game doesn’t have heavy aim assist, but it doesn’t move your joysticks for you and it exists for a reason. I just don’t find PC elitists pointing out aim assist every opportunity they get not to be constructive, especially considering MnK is leaps and bounds better than controller, period. I played PC for about 20 minutes and was able to laser people cross map with primaries more accurately than I can on console after 18 years of playing. The lack of recoil and wider range of motion involved on PC and the aim assistance on console make both input methods easy.               
---
                  
---
As far as the jump shot goes, I hit these all the time and the reticle bobbing on the jump is artificial and if your reticle is centered you’ll hit the shot. I’m also using Icarus grip so I’m not sure what’s so lucky about it. You can see in the [frame](https://imgur.com/a/bfBhdfb) that I took my shot that the reticle is still in its normal spot on the screen(and is on the guy’s head), even though the reticle is sitting lower in the scope than it normally is. Just some food for thought. But yeah, they couldn’t hit me
---
As i said, it's the Vanguard Dare
---
It’s because he is using a network limiter. It’s not an in game glitch per se. it’s him manipulating his connection so the game doesn’t register things properly. 
---
People doing this in SotP depositing charges is the first time I remember people abusing it in D2. 
---
That’s not something easily patched unfortunately. It is straight up cheating though. That’s not the same as just abusing an in game glitch.
---
Eyes are a tad skewed, but the attention to detail is phenomenal. Great work
---
I have many hours on this game and even I did not know this info. Thanks again
---
Cayde looking kinda thicc ngl 😳

Hey ill give it to you just give me some time

Hmm, I should really keep carrying it since I'm just trashing almost everything these days.

Where would this small switch be??
---
I think keeping us immortal is pretty neat imo.
---
Probably not I just focused on the story part on the moon . But this was the first thing I got when I first went there for the Shadowkeep dlc and no matter what I do it stays. I also can’t discard it which I thought was odd.
---
There goes the average joe. Doesn't know how to make an argument unless its against a straw man.

Bitches gonna bitch ay

I thought it only had Rampage and Archer's Tempo?
---
100x this. You'd think CoO/WM never happened.
---
My thoughts as well
---
Bruh he ded af Lumbago what a bot amirite literally
---
Yeah that is odd.  I honestly dont remeber seeing that pop up for me as a quest.  I'm sure someone will know why.  People on reddit are usually good at helping with tips.
---
Ok so enlighten me then. What items specifically are you talking about?
---
It's...so...beautiful!!!!
---
That's the first essence you get for the storyline in the moon
---
If you've done the story then you've got a known bug and it's stuck in your inventory until fixed
---
If you haven't done the story then you're pretty early on and have a bit to go before you're finished

people posting the same meme about wanting to be hit with arc damage while holding riskrunner be like

"come on come on, i want you to do it, i want you to do it, come on upvote me"
---
Use Forge polymer consumable to give a piece of armor each time you forge a weapon
---
why? because yes
---
I did that forge 2 times and got both exotics those 2 runs never touched it since.

Good job

I knowwww

I am a proud titan who got NF a few weeks ago. I used one 2% of the time.
---
In D1 I think they were from the portal to the past of the final vault of glass raid encounter
---
In D2 they’re found exclusively in the Curse of Osiris DLC missions and a handful of Adventures on Mercury
---
Both are just from my memory so correct me if I’m wrong
---
I m sure its flux but is it gensym knight? Idont know so much hunters coz i play titan and warlock in polish language
---
It was random drops before, right? I finally finished both quests after 6 weeks. Damn thing was bugged for the longest time!
---
I use Getaway Artist exotic gloves with the Risk Runner, I have not came across a more fun or powerful combination.

Very nice! My advice would be to keep an eye on proportions when you are first beginning to sketch it out as a whole.

I am free from school tomorrow thats why im asking :D

---
The impact stat (and any other stat for that matter) is only helpful when comparing two weapons of the same type. For example, two hand cannons. Stats are not normalized across weapon types, so impact/range/handling etc. all mean different things for different weapon types. In the case of impact, the impact stat is mostly tied to your rpm. Faster firing weapons typically have less impact, while slow firing weapons have more.
---
tl;dr: The only real way to tell how much damage your gun does is to go shoot something with it since stats aren't normalized.
---
Gets hit with one bullet, *laughs in Thor*
---
*Immigrant Song starts playing*
---
Who needs cinemas when your have this
---
I like that you wanted to do it and got it done regardless of budget. That's badass.
---
Shadowkeep has been the same price since launch, if there was a price hike then you can blame the PlayStation network and not Bungie, because since it is Sony's platform they get final say in what prices are
---
Ancient Gospel. From 3rd encounter of Garden of Salvation raid. Solid HC, lots of good perks to choose from.

---
I know that stuff it’s just annoying to me. That’s just a personal thing and out of all the stats, the one most needed to be displayed in my opinion is damage. I would rather stats be normalized but as long as they show PvP damage I wouldn’t care. I think all guns of the same type could be normalized at least! So if all hand cannons no matter if they are kinetic or energy and no matter the rpm you could tell their damage relative to hand cannons.
---
Not sure if the person making these reads the comments, but the only small QoL I'd like for the infograph is show the possible reward for the Ordeal since it is possible to get the NF drop from it...I'd greatly appreciate it!
---
For those wondering, the possible drop this week is Trichromatica, the ghost. I know I can Google it, but I like having all the changes in a jpeg I can save to my phone while I work!
---
Oh no. Have you gotten the 3 pinnacle weapons?
---
The Badge is in the Triumph page. Its a rough grind. It’s the reason I gave up on obtaining this Seal.
---
GLORIOUS!!
---
Np, indeed it's a pain in the ass, had to do almost 30 forges to get all pieces, it sucks :/
---
Alright, sorry didn’t realize.
---
Lmao this happened to me once but instead of that I died behind the tank and somehow killed me
---
Pc
---
Thank you!
---
I’m glad it’s not just me having this problem
---
I'm a Hunter Sentry, so no real opionion on subclass.
---
As for weapons though, Sniper / Shotgun is good *assuming* you have some Armor 1.0 gear to get both scavenger perks. Otherwise, you'd want something like: 
---
Jade / Ikelos, Blast Furnace / Ikelos, Parcel of Stardust / Polaris Lance, or even Threat Level / Polaris Lance
---
Same.
---
I'm also hunter and in about the same place as you, and it's mostly 100rec, 100int, and 100mob that people are chasing.

Yeah, wait are you talking about the digital deluxe version. The expansion itself cost 20$ here in Norway

Yes, it’s called the tribute hall

Was looking at buying DLC due to steam sale. Am I missing out on important content if i buy just Shadowkeep and not Forsaken as well?
---
Imagine next season when Exodus Crash possibly becomes an ordeal nightfall, I bet they would be the sadistic type who make the strike full of arc damage modifiers that don’t benefit us
---
Well it just let me rebuy the frame for a modulus report and still says legendary frame. Ill be back when i finish it
---
Xur is in the game starting on the weekend (so Friday’s morning reset). He leaves after the weekly reset Tuesday morning.
---
If I buy Shadowkeep, will it just come with Season of Undying pass, which will only last a week or two more (whenever Season switches)?
---
destiny matchmaking? that’s all games matchmaking. regions exist
---
its not about topping the boards, its about how much you have to tryhard to actually win. dont remember last time i had fun times playing pvp.
---
win/enjoyment&gt;kills imo and seeing how piss easy mt/recluse or jotun are to get kills, topping the boards dont mean much. its all about the W. im fine rtunning up vs those players who use those guns if they are solo, they generally try and killwhore but never try to win where as parties both killwhore while having much easier time winning.

Ok

Ad it has the voice of Xol

I think it's randomly on the gear you earn while playing Gambit (not sure if it has to be Gambit Prime/Reckoning gear) and you'd have to get it from a dismantle. It came out last season along with Gambit Blackguard so I'm not sure if they're accessible now.
---
I don't give a fuck. It's a great drawing and showcases an impressive amount of understanding of light and texture. The shapes are off, sure, but this guy is clearly skilled. You shouldn't say negative shit if you aren't gonna back it up. As far as I'm concerned, he has no authority to say it looks shit if he isn't gonna show that he has any understanding of what the flaws even are. 
---
Fair argument but honestly I don't really care since he's being an ass lmfao
---
I love how tight fitting that helm is
---
Its has good dps and a good ability, not the best though.
---
After the original Half-Life there was a trend in gaming where a lot of protagonists were silent in-game ostensibly giving agency to the player to interpret 
---
 the story goings-on through their own perspective (rather than have the writer dictate what is happening through the protagonist character)

Unfortunately, most games did this completely wrong. The idea in the Half-Life games was that you were *shown* the story rather than just socratically told it (games are such a fascinating way of delivering a well told story yet hardly any take anything but the textual approach to it, but I digress). Games that tried to emulate them just went with the same process they always did except they left the protagonist character mute which is obviously just extremely lazy. Case-in-point: that scene in the red war campaign where the protagonist guardian raises their hand to speak only to have the ghost answer for them yet again. This followed by another hand gesture indicating the guardian’s irritation (again silently!!). It’s comedy but emblematic of that trend and clearly demonstrates that the protagonist being mute is very much intentional. I skipped the rest of the DLC and came back with shadowkeep and was very pleased to hear the guardian finally have some words to say.

There are 100 levels to it. If you can bang out 8 levels a day, every day, until season reset, yes. You can complete it.
---
Damn. Ok I’ll still give it a shot
---
I was just making a joke....
---
I know but I could not help myself. BTW, sorry for the bad quality my laptop is pretty shit.
---
I may just have to then! Can you remember his name or insta? I’d love to check him out!
---
It's the 'pulse rifle' of hand cannons, fun to use.
---
No problem

Subjunctive or the moon one.

"I say we go right."
---
"No, we go left."
---
"Right."
---
"Left."
---
"Bullshit, left is clearly wrong. The Dreg came from the right, that means their headquarter is on the right."
---
"Oh yeah? What tells you he wasn't returning to the headquarter?"
---
"You know what, fuck you."
---
"Fuck you too."

I've always had the overloards spawn by killing the 2 hydra then the boss in the first 2 phases then on the third wait till the 3 hydra spawn kill them then the boss and it seems to work
---
Wait, you WANT to use a controller over mouse and keyboard???
---
Well to each their own :)
---
Guy i made this for say evrything is geysum knight
---
Me too friend
---
Yes, I agree.
---
is it easy to get 8 levels a day? im level 12 with the free version
---
Nope, In d1 each individual enemy faction had subdivisions in them. Namely the fallen houses, vex collectives, and branches of the cabal. It’s a shame most of them just devolved into one faction in d2
---
Okay, I was just going by what it actually came out looking like
---
*waaaaaa*
---
I just read discussion saying that if you have the current season pass and you buy another of the same (in this case SotU), then you get season unlock to use for the next season or a later season. 
---
Trying to find a second source on this before I buy lol. Thanks for the tip.
---
Haven’t bought it yet

Ya its thicc
---
I’m just glad I’m not alone lol
---
There are methods saving up bounties and redeeming them all at once and using ghost that up your xp gain
---
Save it for the next season pass. Trust me.
---
Question is, what is he t-bagging?
---
It was nearly free to do. I got tools so i need only to buy some basic materials like alluminim plate and laikra
---
all...the...damn...time
---
I'm pretty sure the moon and vex offensive smgs can get good rolls. Surrounded+threat detector sounds nice.
---
I've never seen someone try to use Golden Gun like a shotgun. Until now.
---
Would buy
---
Shoot. Quite a bit.
---

I miss him. You. Whatever.
---
AMAZING
---
Thats extremely rare tho. I mainly play as an i vader but when my team had a guy who knew how to do it better than i do, i switched. Jack of all trades works better than mostpeolle thint
---
You're looking at the wrong challenge, the challenge on the top it registering fine, it's the lower one which isn't, I am indeed light lvl 860 but I have surpassed the 100.000 points mark multiple times now and it is not registering, I don't think I need to be light lvl 900 for it to register, I think it's just a bug.
---
Pretty sure it’s a dreg but ok
---
I’d recommend getting forsaken and shadow keep as the exotics provided in the forsaken dlc are one of the best weapons in the game like the Izanagi’s burden. Deluxe will give you random exotics in the season passes so they can’t be guaranteed to be any good

As a Hunter main I can only say I wouldn't expect a Titan to understand her.
---
Better, a pistol bayonet is basically a knife, but this gives you significant mechanical advantage.  The main drawback would be how front heavy it would be.  Axes are basically the lovechild of swords and maces.
---
Who says I’m a Titan
---
My bad, in stupid
---
Just a lowly Anglophone here, I can understand a smattering of some languages. But I can't speak anything else but English fluently or with any confidence I'd get the proper message across.

Any word if it will be on sale at Christmas again, or if I should buy it now?
---
I'm trans myself. I've been called a trap before. I've been physically assaulted for being trans. When people make "trap" jokes, they're signaling to me that they don't *care* that a lot of trans women hate that word, have trauma around that word, or have been harmed by the idea that we're somehow trapping men by being attractive to them.
---
But hey, be transphobic if you wanna. Internet's full of people who agree with you.

Deception 100
---
Not OP but I believe it is quite balanced console side, Its my favorite gun to use but I find myself quite often changing to ace depending on the map/loadouts of the enemy because it has a very niche range and execution with a controller. Still a beast of a gun but not as ridiculous as on PC by a long ways
---
It's still trippy though. He did it with sword, that's what he used the Heavy Ammo for. May have been a Black Talon though
---
Keep telling yourself that.
---
Its a 180 rpm, so it doesn't hit as hard as the other handcannon types, but its recoil is more like what you would experience on non handcannon weapons (gun doesn't kick back off the screen). Ikelos comes with Seraph rounds (super ricochet rounds) and rampage. Its a year 1 weapon, so it can't get random rolls.
---
It takes 4 shots to kill, so you'd be potentially trading away lethality for ease of use. The Vex Offensive Handcannon 'Optative' is another void 180, but it can roll with perks like killclip to let it 3 shot.
---
If you want to stick with the 3 tapping 140rpm handcannons like Better Devils, I'd recommend going after the 'Kindled Orchid' from the Black Armory, which is a void 140rpm that you can reliably farm for good rolls on.
---
I do when I am on the couch in front of the bigger screen and lazing around.
---
I mostly like crucible seson 5
---
Then how is it a “costplay”?
---
After the first mission in the Red Legion campaign, I would only trust him to guard my worst enemy, while my aim would be to kill said enemy.
---
I mean armor set
---
I will shoulder charg...wait no I will hit you with a really fancy throwing knife
---
That's cool, nobody tends to know what xur has until Friday afternoon generally and even then it can be subject to change an hour or two after he arrives. If you need to know his location for the week, you can check out this site: https://whereisxur.com/.
---
Cool theory but it's unlikely. Only the sol divisive worship the darkness, which is the minority of vex, the rest are against the darkness and the light. It's probably just a coincidence, and I doubt we will even see the future vex in D3 considering that the future vex were only seen in the infinite forest while the vex conquered the solar system, which we obviously stopped.
---
It’s up:)
---
My bad
---
Just take this upvote
---
Same, I've only played hunter
---
You’re right, he protected Ikora in the cut scene...no one can be trusted
---
Now that is insane. Since last weekend i use the wardcliff coil and man does it shred people. Last game i pulled an army of one and healed back one full bar of their primeval...we still lost because they had two warlocks, one with Novabomb the other with chaos reach so they just melted it
---
So what are we saying about the people on /r/trap because they identify themselves as a trap? Are the transphobic against themselves? Do they get marginalized because they choose to identify as such?
---
My group did one around 920. It did take a few hours and a few hundred revives though, and we got 0 score... but at least we got great loot.

They're espousing a narrative that's used to hurt trans women, so yeah, they're contributing to societal transphobia.
---
I like them all. Zavala the father figure(strong and duty bound). Ikora the mother figure (strength through compassion and understanding). Cayde 6 the asshole best buddy/partner in crime( light hearted/friendly/positive thinker to hide his true feelings of loneliness(he misses his wife and son ace).
---
The ads can get over whelming at times if your by yourself. I’ve got pretty good as a hunter triple jumping spinning in the air and tossing the battery to hit the forge. Never can set still if I’m by myself up there lol

Right the fact that you just called Zavala daddy (I can get behind, or in front dealers choice) and Ikora mummy really worries me

is anyone else feeling a little turned on right now?

This is why i don't play gambit, or another team-associated mission/event...i don't want to fuck up experienced player's chance at doing well as I will, undoubtedly, do something stupid (or panicky).
---
Well, Ikora is known to be ”champion”/terror of the Crucible at least lorewise, so theres that...
---
thanks for the update! about to read
