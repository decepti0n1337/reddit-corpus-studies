That's what I'm saying bro. Been waiting forever it feels
---
Yeah its either an oversight or they purposely left it underpowered but weapons usually perform differently in the sandbox vs when its implemented in the community, unforseeable things can happen with its values. I do think they purposely did it and have to deal with a broken overpowered weapon. Originally it was probably 3x more powerful but came across a bug that could've been exploited for pure melting power on bosses. Hopefully they fix it soon, so it can be fun to use and not just some power weapon taking up an exotic slot.
---
Same here man its ridiculous
---
You still get them from strike and crucible but you need to use one of the runefinder thing
---
I can already tell by this video you're terrible at the game
---
The robot sell a Runefinder consumable that allows you to randomly get runes from running various activities in the game. Lasts for 4 hours.
---
Check the postmaster
---
nothing there :(
---
Thanks for the info. I was going to do this quest today but if the gun is trash then duck it.
---
It shoots mini rockets. Rockets don’t crit. Pretty sure it’s intentional. Explosive rounds already exist in the game if they intended for this weapon to have explosive rounds similar to a scout or hand cannons then they would of just applied that perk.
---
It’s broken. No idea when it will be fixed.
---
That triumph doesn’t have a reward tied to it? I’m shitting at work right now so I’ll have a look through my triumphs and see if I can find it
---
Unless you have a gaming laptop it more than likely won’t run well
---
Why are you apologizing for art?!
---
I do know this might not work for you, it's not for everyone, but I DO think the closest thing to this you can get would be just subscribing to Google stadia and getting literally the cheapest laptop you can buy. As long as the internet works, you can play destiny 2 on there no problem, and I think I remember Google saying stadia members get destiny 2 for free. Might be worth a check. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

How do u get that low draw time?

I'm on my warlock and I'll be dammed if I do the opening quests on the moon again

No, doesn't matter if u cross save ur account to another system. If on the system ur currently on, you do not own that needed dlc, you will NOT get access on it. Dlcs and expansions are system specific.
---
I must have hit it right.  I bought a few and finished my season.
---
😂😂😂😂😂

Lol I got you. But your right. I like the idea, the concept is great. But the execution is severely flawed.

It assimilates. Kabr drank it, once. The radiolaria took his mind, his body, his Ghost. His last act as himself was to shape his infected ghost and what Light he had left into a shield against the forces at work in the Vault of Glass, that the next fire team did not meet the same fate.
---
Similarly, A Thing Was Done to Asher Mir within the Pyramidion. His arm is a Vex arm. When he pricks the opposite hand, he bleeds radiolaria. He can feel the Vex. He feels his condition progressing.
---
It is possible, even probable, that Asher is the next iteration of an experiment that began when Kabr drank of that Oracle.

Shaxx is a sociopath that somehow got into the city, and I love him for it.

i tried and it didn’t let me weird

Bad Juju was at least worth the grind. XD   
---
I'm no completionist, so I can't be arsed doing quests for exotics that are either trash, or that I'll never use.
---
With Shadowkeep I felt really comfortable putting money on Silver to support bungie, even putting on about £30. But with it FotL being incredibly expensive,  both in terms of Silver and bright dust, I don’t feel comfortable putting money on anymore.

i thought bad juju was gonna be like that but i still wanted it in my collections. then i used it. well worth the grind

I still don't agree with you. But let's agree to disagree :P

Wut. Hold your reload button to proc honed edge. It literally works for me every time. Could it be that you don't have enough ammo to get **Honed Edge x4**?

Play the haunted forest and collect the loot out of the chest at the end. I think you get a random mask ornament for each completion - it took me 5ish completions (I wasn't keeping track).

Do the Haunted Forest. It's a random drop from the Chest

Awesome.
---
Yeah. I went for it mainly because I love pulse rifles, and have wanted it since D1, but didn't end up getting it there. So nice to finally have my hands on it. I end up switching between that and Sweet Business for clearing groups of weaker targets, but lean more towards Bad Juju at this point.
---
Yeh iv never disconnected before guess servers are under stress
---
Really fun, not too challenging if you’re on level
---
ahhh crap. yeah, you're right. i don't know where I got that from. sorry. just accuracy.
---
Do you not remember Halo Hunters flinging you into rocks and walls and instakilling you?
---
It's from that spooky event
---
What's the level
---
You can be outraged at both?
---
Older weapons before the shadowkeep update dont have the new energy/mod slots.
---
940 to 960
---
You don’t have forsaken but you bought shadowkeep? What’s your light level? Just play the game and a bow will drop.
---
Fps is always better on PC!
---
Cuz now they aren’t getting money from a publisher, they’re entirely self reliant now. And asfaik this is Bungie’s only relevant title on current gen. If that’s the case, the money they make of this game is their only source of income
---
Something physics related always happens. Even when you jump. Gravity brings you back down
---
The game is hardly free to play More like free to invest
---
Peregrine greaves does great with the mask mod that gives bonus boss damage. We had 2 of those and I had a spike GL and never needed more than 1 mag to kill a boss. That meant we got supers for the rest plus your favorite heavies and specials for majors and add clear. Got it our 2nd try.
---
It's a simulation
---
940, final boss might be higher than that
---
It’s the raid from the forsaken dlc. It’s found on the dreaming city if you have the dlc
---
i wanted it because i didn’t use it enough in destiny 1. barely payed attention to the perks and how good it was all around and i had red death as my go to exotic pulse anyway. at least i now know how good it is.
---
I've been using SMGs as well.  A lot of threads advise using fusion rifles but limited ammo kills it for me.  With crouch camping and hunter invisbility for the second kill, I easily manage multiple medals per match.
---
Unfortunately, I didn't have access to a lot of SMGs since I stopped playing when Curse of Osiris dropped.  But out of my available pool of weapons, I found riskrunner to be a beast in terms of stats.  Prior to that I was using Mob Justice.  I wish I had the recluse though.  I hear great things about it.
---
*pointing* This post gave me cancer
---
Yeah fair enough. I think Red Death was the first exotic I got in D1. Forget what it did now, but I know I loved it.
---
you or your friend
---
Spare Rations / Eriana’s and Le Mon. Only focused crits on the harpies with the bow; took maybe 4-5 runs total. Done with crits long before total kills.
---
Pc is way better, it doesn't feel sluggish
---
I was thinking the same thing when I played it.  Swat from Halo.  Unfortunately, I never enjoyed Swat but it might be worthwhile to rack up those scout rifle kills.
---
Shhhh you aren’t supposed to blow the shameless plugs cover smh
---
life steal (hits and kills restore health) and it was just crazy good in pvp and pve. now we have crimson which isn’t good but at least red death is still remembered
---
Not gonna lie to you chief, on console this subjunctive is just as good as recluse
---
Shaxx: WHAT?! WHAT?! HOW?!?!?
---
Yep, got the transponder on my warlock and I'm doing it on my warlock.
---
:)
---
Got it yesterday it’s pretty trashy ...  would fuse it to other weapon if I can get another one for that easy 950
---
Bounties aren't something you need focus on, certainly not in the early going. Aside from playing through Red War, which you should definitely do, explore planets and pick up Adventure and Patrols. Participate in public events when they pop up and explore some lost sectors. Most planets will have an "Intro to..." bounty which will prompt you to do a chunk of the content available. Collect some planetary materials and turn them into the local NPC for better gear.
---
Once you're confident with the controls and have a half-decent kit, try a few strikes. They're very easy to drop into and run through, and huge fun.
---
That armor looks like paper craft, I like it.
---
Wait. What? You have my interest.
---
What quest does it come from?
---
Yep, never picked it up on anything else.
---

Sauce? (Armor pieces/shaders) I made a buzz lightyear Titan, but that's pretty cool.
---
Inserting a key into the box isn’t counting, turning in the crystal you get after a rare bounty doesn’t count
---
I think you are thinking of the fusion rifle merciless?
---
Very odd. I can't think of any reason why it shouldn't be rewarding you the rifle. Did you log out and back in?
---
Do you have Shadowkeep?
---
Now THAT is a pro-tip.
---
so I’m guessing when he asks, “How’s your sister?”, the people who answer will shoot him twice with his gun. i’d like to see how this plays out.
---
Has to be.
---
Yes that's it, but I was mistaken it's the Lord of wolves that has the criticals the burst fire on it confused me though it's a shotgun

The Dungeon?
---
Where the hell does this game have Dungeons?
---
Guardian, you're flying back early!
---
Yes I do, and I have completed the shadowkeep quest line on another character
---
Yeah he opens the door says how’s your sister materializes a gun and gives it to them so they can shoot him one in the body ish and then the head
---
It's /r/Rainbow6 all over again...
---
High Discipline, Oppressive Darkness, Ashes to assets, Contraverse Holds slowva bomb. 32s grenade timer at max discipline, less with contraverse holds giving grenade energy on hit (I run axion bolt) and ashes to assets give a nice amount of super energy on grenade hits, which you’ll be doing a lot of.
---
Sauce?
---
What toothbrush quest?
---
The typical candy quest line for the festival of the lost. It starts with Eris, she gives you a box of raisins, then you take them to the planet listed and they give you a quest which gives you another treat and so on...
---
Yeah it’s pretty underwhelming
---
Hooooo man.  I need this.
---
I just had the music from Last season blast in my head along with a blinding white light. Ahh memories~
---
All exotic handcannon and the lunas are still pretty good, as long as your not trying to outplay someone long range with a scout or sniper
---
Cool it is.
---
Try nightstalker bottom tree, it does more damage than top tree solar with celestial after buff. Hunters good for pve but sucks in pvp due to its lack of ttk abilities compared to warlock/Titan
---
I laughed when I first saw that yesterday I could hear it in my head too
---
“Here, take this gun and shoot me. Trust me I know what I’m doing here.”

---
Prob escalation protocol armor would be the hardest grind since only one piece drops per week
---
Yes, one in the mag. As far as I know, all light grenade launchers hold only one grenade at a time.
---
Oh *yes*
---
I did this with strangers and i thaught them how to do it. Basically all you need to pay attention to is the percentage of when you reach 100 and youll get to the boss room. Many people resurrect their teammates when you could speedrun to 100 because if they respawn you get back to the first area. So once you die and you around 80% never go for the ress just focus on ad clearing. Theres a few mods like the trition you need to care for. Thats the only mod that significent slows your speedrun. So youll have to skip most smaller ads and aim towards elites that shine red to unlock next areas, they also controbute to a bigger % gain. This should easily let you alone get to 9 if you know your way around. You should also use a masterworked weapon to gain your ult for every boss. This alone got me to branch 10 with 40 seconds in spare. Hope this gives you an idea

The raisin quest you get from Eris. Give the raisins to Spider and he’ll give you som stuff to do. And so om and so on and so on. 
---
Do not forgot to brush your teeth. Dental hygiene is key to a long life!
---
Agree 100%. I'm willing to give Bungie the benefit of the doubt, but I personally don't see why they changed the system in the first place - before, you'd be playing an activity, go to Tower, turn in Engrams... dismantle anything you didn't want for BD, maybe grab some bounties from Tess and do those while you're playing.
---
Your notion about Gambit/Strikes, I echo 200,000%. PvP is the only "main" gamemode that I'll play casually - as in, it's the main thing I'll get on and do, even if I don't have any reason to do it.
---
I don't *want* to play Gambit or Strikes unless I have explicit reason to do so. Again: Yes, this is absolutely a "me" problem. But I've already done the Ritual stuff (Ritual guns, shaders/emblems for Collections Badges) for this season. I don't want to play any more Gambit haha
---
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
---
I will say that I fully understand why they're attempting to increase user retention and whatnot by increasing the relevance of Ritual stuff... but come on. Tie pinnacles to that, fine. Tie EXP to that, fine, that's good. Tie the one method of getting the "good" cosmetic stuff to that? No thank you.
---
Finishers seem to be a gamble for me; not sure what it is, but sometimes at the very end of the animation something happens to cause the architects to smear me over nearby surfaces.

I think you need to hit 900 light (don't quote me) I remember being confused too. They are the yellow icons on the destinations map. 3 crubile matches, nightfalls and so on.
---
I suggest not trying to progress the quest at all. It seems like literally every part of the quest is bugged.
---
Well i cant really buy it so which spot could give me a lot of leg3ndary engreams i really want the exotic bow
---
yeah what emote?
---
You can solo the new dungeon?

I'd say that's normal. Sometimes that person might not correctly select how many players they need vs. how many are allowed for that particular content. Keep refreshing and with a little luck you should be good.

If you own forsaken or Shadowkeep there are 2 by now. I don't think they have matchmaking at all. There are 2 other "unique missions" in case you didn't know. One of them contains the whisper of the worm and the other one the outbreak prime, which actually used to be a raid exotic in D1. And they have a timer, so good luck.
---
Also the fact hes using that super in PVE in general.

😂😂😂

Yah just finished it lol

Instead of the jacket costing $777 you can beat the raid and get a code that discounts it to $149. It’s a cool bomber jacket that you can get your gamer tag on
---
It’s because literally the game gives you handfuls of vex components while barley giving us a chocolate coins. Makes sense
---
thats dope👍🏻
---
That look so convincing! As if lord shaxx is a playable character.
---
How about some Ryan Reynolds to spice things up a bit
---
Since I'm too bad to get The Last Word I made a new character (a warlock) and I'm gonna play survival with it, it should be easier since I'll be on a lower glory rank.
---
What class and subclass do you recommend for pvp?
---
I don’t wholly disagree with you, but I do disagree with the premise of your sniper argument (or that titans are inherently overpowered.) Snipers are quite strong, however they rely on good positioning and use of angles in order to perform well. If you know the sniper lanes, and you have good movement, you can counter snipers easily (just watch any streamer; they rarely get sniped because they understand their position relative to their opponents.) 
---
Additionally, I don’t think titans are inherently too strong. The issue lies almost (*almost*) exclusively with one eyed mask. Bottom tree striker is no doubt too strong as well, but with recent damage resistance nerfs it’s not nearly the problem it was two months ago.
---
It looks really good! I tried to make make one but it broke a lil.
---
I bet ya'll can't guess the first thought i had when I first glanced at the last perk of the gun.
---
Play the game. Do quests. There's so much content to go through before reaching some sort of end game.
---
You can still access endgame content such as raids and high difficulty nightfalls before completing every quest and activity.
---
Don't worry about builds until youre higher power and able to do harder activities (better start rolls). Aim to get near 950 and then you can work on builds, as everything is effectively available to you.
---
The moon event gives a stupid amount of candy. It’s decent for the coins too.
---
That's a book??

Yo, Angelo
---
Sometimes he changes what he says like he'll say prickly cactus here or not so well kakis.... etc 
---
That may he why aswell
---
Too true
---
With the addition of Thundercoil, your maximum damage is actually pretty close to pre-nerf levels.
---
You leave taeko alone. she tried her best 😭
---
So I can use insurmountable skullfort? Hell yes!
---
You leave Taeko alone,she tried her best. 😭
---
Dude you look like a Bionicle
---
I’m not gonna bother with you lmao
---
Fabled is the easiest part of the quest. The triple kills is a pain with the heavy drop nerf in Shadowkeep.
---
I’m also relatively new but I’ve stuck to warlock and here’s what I’ve gathered. 
---
1) Don’t trust the meta. Use what you love. If you dislike hand cannons, don’t use em. (etc etc)
---
2) Following 1), find the subclass that works best and feel free to just keep changing it over and over. For me, dawnblade spamming on PvP is fun but I need nova cataclysm for gambit and nova warp for regular PvE. Find what you love. Stick to it.
---
3) In terms of exotics, I’d recommend trying as much as possible, but personally I like the tractor cannon.. and that’s about it. Or the Ace. Exotics aren’t 100% necessary for a good time. Same with gear. Although, with gear, its usually more beneficial. I’d recommend the nezerac’s sin if you settle for voidwalker, lunafaction boots are a good choice in some scenarios, transversive boots and sanguine alchemy. They may be hard to get, but are quite worth it.
---
4) Another general tip is to not worry too much about farming to much higher levels. I currently don’t need to push to 950 or higher so I just remain around 900-910 and it works well.
---
Oh. One more thing. Enjoy the story. Enjoy the game. Don’t worry too much too many specifics since you’ll probably change your mind on what you like in a week. With that said, have fun! Thanks for reading. :D
---
It entirely depends on what your play style is. I run top tree Nightstalker in PvP, and bottom tree in PvE.
---
Its not easy when every game i’m matched against players 10x better than me. I know you only need to win 50% of the time, but so far i win about 20% of the time.
---
All of this is amazing.
---
alot of the tips will be centered around what exotic armor pieces/weapons you have unlocked for your warlock. certain armor pieces for example will take a super from average to incredible in a heartbeat. Simple tips though, use storm caller for pvp as it is a roaming super that is easy to get the hang of... and for pve if you dont have any exotics, you can honestly mess around and have fun with any of the supers.. but if you unlock something that really enhances a specific super i would highly recommend you use that. Make sure to switch between healing and empowering rifts depending on what you are planning to do.. and strafe glide 'with strong directional control' is overall the best jump in my opinion. Just some simple tips for you :)
---
Gambit is fun. Crucible bad.
---
First off. If you can't counter a shoulder charge, that's sad. Play around your opponents. Find a good counter loadout, and use it. 
---
Second. There aren't any grenades in the game right now that can 1 hit, except magnetic grenades which require a mod that takes up 6 energy, and it is rarely ever ran because suppressor has more utility.
---
Third. Half of the things you talk about are easy to counter. Sniper? Flinch them. Shotgunner? Back pedal, learn to play your distance, and out-manuever them. Fusion rifles? Catch them in the air, make them push you.
---
Fourth. Hunters have very strong supers. Arc strider can counter almost any super very well, except for dawnblade and bubble Titan. Tether can shutdown any super, and lead to very easy multi-kills. Spectral has the highest damage resistance and can lead to easy team wipes if you know how to use it. Golden gun is a very powerful, long range tool that can counter snipers, or people playing passively. Blade barrage, again, can shutdown anything. 
---
Fifth. OEM is getting nerfed into the ground, so stop complaining. Titans have 1 exotic that is good, hunters have multiple. I'll list off a few. Shards, khepris sting, liars handshake, stompees, frostees, foetracer, graviton forfeit, Orpheus rig, lucky pants, and the list continues. The only other mildly good exotics Titans have is helm of saint, which provides no boost to your neutral game, and only helps your super, and Ursa furiosa, which, again, provides no neutral game boost whatsoever. 
---
Finally. By the way you talk about all the different guns and abilities, I can tell you rarely play crucible because there are a lot of innaccuracies in this post. I suggest actually learning how to play the game. It might help you see that you just don't know how to counter things. Sniping does take skill, and I can clearly tell you are frustrated that you don't have that skill. I've been playing this game for 5 years, and only started mastering the skill in y3 of d1, only to have all that work thrown out the window when d2 launched, and it took me nearly a year and a half to get back to the oint I was at. Keep playing, and you'll eventually learn to play the game
---
Anyone know how to get the moon shell and the ship? I randomly got the sparrow but that was after 40+ hours of doing moon stuff.
---
wait till you start looking into hand cannons.
---
like half of the hand cannons use the same base model. exotics included.
---
r/KilledByTheArchitects
---
Which handcannon is that?
---
Saw this months ago, aint yours.
---
The feeling when you body with snipe and lucky pants procs and TLW comes out in a millisecond
---
U sure u completed Zero Hour? If u did it and didn't get the gun then some adds were alive still when the timer ended. U have to kill everything in the room and some adds like hiding in stealth at the back of the room.
---
Where's the gun tho
---
Well what are they suppose to do against a tank
---
I didn't then, I do now, but it doesn't always protect you as in [this case](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/steam-accounts-being-stolen-through-elaborate-free-game-scam/) of fake log-in windows. I thought I saw a legit steam log-in pop-up but now I'm not so sure since I can't think of any other way they would get my details.
---
Even better, can you triple dip with nezarecs sin and using a void demolitionist?
---
Make it a grupal dance
---
Yeah missing for this Halloween costume I know! 
---
But I just can't get used to Jade Rabbit, it is just not great imo.
---
Nope :&lt;
---
Yea back in Destiny 1 durring the rise of iron DLC if you broke down the Khovostov you would get an exotic blueprint quest for the exotic version of the gun. I loved it! Its main thing was you would switch its weapon type from scout rifle auto and pulse
---
I don't blame you. It just can't compete with other stuff
---
SHIIIIIIIIIZAAAAAAAAAA
---
Wow. Alright... Thank you! Glad you have it back.
---
Guardian down
---
There is a "vault" in the tower where you can store things you want to keep. It looks like 3 ATMs between shaxx and the gunsmith.
---
This. I honestly don't even miss recluse anymore, because it hits decently hard too
---
I can hear this gif
---
Damn your fireteam needs some work
---
I live how titans look like their wearing bath towels on their waist
---
I think this comparison is drawn because Blind Well is in an enclosed space, i.e. you have to go looking for it to actually find it. Also the new moon event, much like EP, has you progress through tiers rather than put in something that causes the event to start and end at a single tier.
---
You don't have to worry about deleting cosmetics, when you dismantle them it actually just adds the ornament to your library permanently.
---
Unlike armour Ornaments, you can't view weapon ornaments in game under an organised list.
---
if you ever want to see what armour ornaments you have just go to Collection &gt; Armour. It'll show both the armours you've aquired and any ornaments specific to those armours.
---
Ornaments will appear in the respective category of what armour it's equipped on. Example: binary phoenix is a crucible armour so both the binary phoenix armour and the ornaments for it are under the "Competative" armour tab.
---
Some ornaments can be equipped on any legendary piece of armour, these ornaments appear in the "Universal Ornaments" tab.
---
The only way to preview your weapon ornaments in game is either to inspect a weapon in your inventory or a weapon in the weapon collection menu. Right click any weapon you suspect you might have an ornament for, go down to the weapon "appearance" screen on the weapon preview and if hover your cursor over the boxes that appear.
---
If in the weapon appearance screen there are two boxes then the weapon can have an ornament (the ornament box looks like two paperclips arranged in a cross). Hover your cursor over that box and 
---
the game will show you if you have any ornamnets for the previewed weapon.
---
*laughs in Bubble Titan again*
---
Damn it now I need to see an exotic that lets you rocket jump
---
This has been posted way too much
---
yeah i kind of like the strike too. espechially the visuals and the ez 1 shot on the boss. but it gets kind of annoying if you get the same strike over and over again
---
Yeah that's a good point
---
I’m not sure honestly. I haven’t had this problem personally. Maybe hover over the mods on another hand cannon?
---
You can summon your sparrow in the air? :O
---
Me too man, me too
---
I'm on the superior system known as PC :P but  can still give so advice. If you like satisfyingly destroying late groups of stuff, you'll love Riskrunner. And Bubble Titan best Titan :D
---
BWAAAAAM
---
I was like, nah that can't happen twice but oh god you poor soul
---
Never tried
---
Master Chief's crotch.
---
Exactly my case. In the meantime, I am trying to level up my titan, since I am looking forward to try bottom Sentinel with Dunemarchers in pvp.
---
No. It's an ornament for the exotic rocket launcher Two Tailed Fox. If you get the rocket launcher then slap that bad boy on in the appearance tab and then never use it because exotic rocket launchers aren't really worth it... unless it's truth... truth is terrifying
---
I'll accept that for once because of how Amazing it is :P but disappointe you aren't Shaxx :P
---
Don’t worry about your light level, just playing the game will give you random drops that will take you up to 900 light eventually. So just enjoy the game and get a feel for it. Like suggested I’d do the campaign missions first then you can move on to strikes, nightfalls, exotic quests, crucible and gambit. The game has a lot to offer but just enjoy playing through the missions and shit first. When you get to 900 then you will see a bunch of missions and quests/activities that will grant you “powerful gear”. Powerful gear is how you grow your light above 900.

Whoa! If you didn’t post I wouldn’t know!
---
I think crown of tempest will extend the duration if cast with full grenade and well.
---
Because there have been multiple complaints about bad connection and bungie had enough of the lag so they just swing the soft boot and you get kicked. I reccomend using a wired connection.
---
Yeah..... I did even know what that is .....
---
What do you mean dumb questions? the quest has been broken almost since the launch of shadowkeep. People are asking questions because the quest isnt working at all, on top of that they said they fixed it and it's even more broken than it was before.
---
Only 60 us dollars plus 150 dollars tax plus go do some microtransactions *noob*
---
This meme perfectly explains why recluse is so nice in pve but so messed up in PvP, good meme
---
Sadly nothing „new“ as the room is filled with these things since Tuesday’s reset. 
---
Only thing to ask is if it’s just an Easter egg or if there’s more to it
---
Yep I wouldnt either
---
All hail RNgesus
---
May our drops be all godroll and no sidearms
---
Amen

even though your grandfather, Joseph, told you the secret of The World, like an exam student scrambling to finish the problems on an exam until the last moments before the chime?

It’s been so long it brought back some repressed memories. What’s it been 4 years now?
---
In D1 there was a Titan towel all ripped up and bloody iirc.
---
I can't shoot the shit out of you without getting close
---
Aye thanks bro!
---
I also wish Bungie would make a "firewall" mode for normal strikes, same as the Haunted Forest.
---
Supposedly, you can force the strikes to a solo run by making your system's time be way off from reality.  At least that was a method people used on PS4 a couple of years ago -- no idea if that still works now or with other platforms.
---
5 times in a row makes me hate every nightfall, I swear
---
They look like they are made of jelly. But nice art
---
Do the knights you kill have a greenish glow? they are the ones that drop the swords :)
---
There's a PvE gamemode on the Nessus Leviathan called Minagerie.
---
You get rewards upon completing minagerie runs through an item called the "Chalice of Opulence" which can be found on the quest screen once unlocked.
---
The Chalice acts as a key for the chest at the end of the mission, you put runes into the chalice, one rune gives random drops from specific categories. x rune rewards snipers, y rune rewards shotguns ect...
---
The chalice has three slots for runes, There are specific orders of runes that guarantee a specific weapon or piece of armour. example: x rune(sniper) + Y rune =  Dreaded Venture.

Nobody pulls off low-key thicc better than our girl Sloane.
---
I would also like to know this
---
Is it bugged? Says i dont have arc, solar, void resistance, or minor, major, boss resist.
---
One thing that I'd recommend is to follow quest steps till the end so you actually learn their purpose. Of course, quest steps for weapons are excluded here. In talking about quest steps for the menagerie or things like that. Those quests are made so that you learn what you have to do, so try and follow them so you know what you can do with the menagerie for example. 
---
Other than that, at least do the weekly challenges and don't think about your appearance ingame until you've reached PL 950, you'll be "wasting" those upgrade modules usually.
---
Hello do you have time to talk about our lord and savior RNGsus
---
Yeah they left after the first encounter, but thanks now I know what they were after.
---
I was wondering why the clip was so long.
---
And then you blew yourself up again and I was like; oh...that’s why
---
Usually quests have an end eventually, I'm not aware of a never-ending quest. Some have only one step, others have many more. It depends on the quest.
---
Nice, did you go with the chest that gives you a second Dodge (don't remember the name) or Orpheus rigs?
---
I've tried it twice with my warlock, once with Nova/devour (didn't work, I'm not used to it yet) and once with well after each orb deposit.  It worked well until the same thing with the knight happened.... I was at the 4th orb at the time it happened and I just smacked my keyboard
---
If it means I get a cat running around with me, yeah why not. Could I get the $200 preorder for a chicken ornament for him?
---
You better post it on r/sharditkeepit because here you will be called out for breaking a rule
---
You like that brand new lmg with a 140 rpm?
---
Yep, console for life. PC gaming has just never appealed to me. The load times don’t bother me too much, gives me time to make dinner, eat with my children, clean the house and get the kids to bed. And that’s all before I even select which character I’m gonna play on!
---
&gt;*The Gunboats*.
---
-65% self-damage taken from explosives.
---
thank you sir
---
Did you have speed demon on your ghost or auto reload on your sparrow?
---
Correct, came out Tuesday and it's in the Altar of Sorrows. Landing zone right next to it. The final two chests, so if you fail Tier V or you kill the boss, whatever happens. Those two chests can drop the three new weapons as well as the Dreamsbane armor and the old moon weapons.
---
A new shader and the "toothbrush" needed for a triumph
---
I got the sniper yesterday
---
Häkke Rocketlaunchers have the tracking build  in their archetype. Hover over the perk on the left.
---
If you hover over the weapon archetype(the white target like icon)it will tell you it has tracking.
---
It is because it has Hakke precision rounds. Different manufacturers have different perks. Its dope right?
---
Lol
---
*bicycle*

That one person who programmed cable balls is laughing to them self right now

Shhh don't bring attention to my wonderful skullfort

o want to ride my
---
Unfortunately they aren't great for killing bosses, they're best for for killing swarms of enemies. 
---
If you need a heavy to do damage a boss consider a grenade launcher, rocket launcher or heavy sniper. 
---
Outside of the exotics the best easily attainable heavy is the outrageous fortune grenade launcher with the perk spike grenades.
---
"Titans have 1 good exotic" bahahahaha and you list lucky pants as a good hunter exotic. You have no idea what your talking about
---
Eh, looks okay, but it's no god roll. Guess you better dismantle it
---
If you reach Branch 9 or higher you'll get pinnacle Gear as Weekly
---
Who's to say this person isn't doing both to maximize his chances of finding his answer quicker.
---
Are you sure you didnt get the pinacle reward from copleting 9 rounds?
---
um i think you mean dick towel
---
We don't serve your kind here. You'll have to wait outside. /s
---
Zenobia always has tracking.  It's just a trait of that particular launcher.
---
The perks make it a good/bad weapon.  I think the favorite I've kept since Y1 haa Snapshot (or maybe Quick Draw?), Cluster, and a Velocity masterwork.  Great in PvE and pretty damned good in PvP.
---
"Dont talk to me or my son ever again"
---
my Hammerhead would like to have a word with you
---
I believe the highest level of gear you can get is 960. That is the highest level power you can get to so. Though idk.
---
Have to start the scarlet keep campaign. About the 3rd encounter iffn I remember right.
---
Jeez, no need to downvote though whoever did that its just an idea lawl
---
Yea I don’t know what claptrap is. I just saw a cat dressed up as a robot that reminded me of tr3vr
---
This is not true.  Slow speed is not the only thing.  Packet loss, sync loss, general live status (think lag switches), etc can all lead to bans.
---
*laughs in ssd*

I think its more meant as a when they decript it and it gives him a slot thats allready at that LL

or continue to use your lag switch

I Just got my rare bounty from ada-1 today as well. I'm really anxious I'm going to accidentally turn it in... I still need the black armory key so who knows how long I'm going to have to be sitting on this thing for...  
---
I've been running the new raid with my group of friends and we can get the first 3 encounters done no sweat, but I think we're lacking damage on the final boss and none of us have izanagis, was hoping this would help but at this point I might not get it until the season is over xD.  
---
I really just want that badge completion for the Undying seal.
---
I love it when people on comms ask things like "do you ever have to reload that thing?"
---
It may not be the best DPS heavy, but damn it is fun
---
Yeppers. Was looking at it real hard last night.
---
F
---
The only thing that transfers between your platforms are the season pass.
---
That game is so cool. Too bad I’m so addicted to Destiny I barely make time to play it 😭
---
... Supers are free kills, wich one did you use? Striker is absolutely obnoxious so if you say that is the one you keep missing... Well i guess we all start somewhere.
---
Thats what I was expecting from risk/reward quest lol, I loved that gun in D1
---
Well shit yep I'm just getting back into destiny from D1 and the trial days. That rather sucks tbh, I was super interested in getting into the event content. Damn
---
I know that, but why would they not drop in the "Pinnicle" PVE activity, its seems wrong and I for one the raid could use some better rewards/ replayability.
---
I finish 2 a day.... 2 of 10th of the quest a day that is.
---
Because whenever I think I finished the quest, the vendor will just say: oH yOu 4HeaD theRe IS MucH MoREE tO dO1!
---
it tasted of the sea lmao
---
#DIOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
---
Oh no D: , I carry 40
---
\*starts sweating profoundly\*
---
Back when arena shooters where big i dont recall radar being a thing at all. Much more fun that way.
---
You can only play it once per character, but many levels of the campaign can be played in the story mission section of the Vanguard menu. Their's only 6 (I think?) available at any one time, so if there's a particular mission you're looking to replay, check it every day. Although I'm not sure if every mission comes up :/
---
&gt;Finished my throwing knife quest super fast! Got so much hate for  middle tree NS with jade rabbit, got 10+ kill streak that gave me 10% in the span of 30 seconds haha
---
I remember when my entire purpose in destiny was to bubble up for golgoroth damage
---
If you finished all the Y1 stuff (main campaign, Osiris, warmind) then roll right into forsaken. Once you've finished that, then Shadowkeep.
---
I've been playing the game for all of 4 days and even I know that you need to both stand in the vortex thing and pay attention to a timer. How do you miss all the bright lights and pretty obvious info?
---
ZA WARUDO is the ULTIMATE stand1
---
Olé
---
Then you die in mid air because for some god foresaken (heh) reason it has less super armor than almost any of the roaming supers.
---
This^
---
I've been using 21% and having a blast. Have done many runs without ever reloading it
---
Warlocks really should have gotten a sash or capelet, SOMETHING with a bit more substance than a glorofied friendship bracelet
---
oh ho instead
---
Yikes.
---
i have finished all the y1 content but how do you get like powerful gear to rank up sorry for asking its been a year and i have forgotten a lot of thses things
---
Do you mean mods? There are many armor mods and some of these are stat mods, like a mobility mod. All stat mods give +10 of the stat they increase.
---
Why not
---
BFFFFFFTTTTT
---
Your attempts at defeating the thralls are... 
---
USELESS! *USELESS!* **USELESS!** ***USELEEEEESSSS!***
---
It is. I just got it. We can't infuse it either
---
Yeah, 21% is my favorite heavy.  That being said, try deathbringer in Haunted forest. Use it as artillery.  Every time a new section opens up, just shoot over the top of it and watch the fireworks!  You rarely even get hit.
---
HINJAKU HINJAKU !
---
You're already 750. You should be able to get to 770 in no time. Then no more rip haunted forest.
---
Gwisin is so bad now! That guys never allowed in my fireteam
---
"always know, where your towel is"
---
Ford- 2005
---
All Titans heed this advice.
---
It's not a bubble! It's a rock!
---
It's based on the average of all of your gear, that's the number on the right in the character screen. Powerful rewards are always above your average from 1 to 6 based on the tier of the reward (1,2 or 3). Other loot will be either at or below the average you have.
---
Taken Captains would like to have a word with you
---
For autos. The Dan. As with everything you need a good roll.
---
Can someone explain what’s happening here
---
I just rewatched that last night!
---
is that mf jojo reference?

You can carry 20 motes?
---
I did Pyramidian 5 times. it glitch as well
---
Trash it’s trash

Erentil is a solid pvp fusion. Loaded question for pve, second to none.
---
Ahh
---
knew i forgot something, although IB is only once a month... :/
---
They did?
---
If your quick enough, yes you can :3
---
Like right below the spawn point for Sanctuary. As soon as you spawn in sanctuary there is a little ramp going down to your right. Go down that and take another right into the room.
---
?
---
Good job!
---
Altars of Sorrow
---
Xenophage was just added on Tuesday with the release of this event
---
🤦‍♂️ I meant as a reward for participating in the event
---
For real. I was having fun theroy crafting and trying different weapons, only to be farmed by squads using jade rabbit. It killed the fun for me after 4 matches and I was done.
---
Oooh another crybaby bitching and moaning about a fun Halloween-themed event
---
I was already farming the Jade Rabbit catalyst so now I'm really conflicted about trying this mode.
---
It Wouldn't make sense to add a limited time exotic for a week long event though.. how would you get it after the event? If you didn't play the event you the you could never complete your exotic collection?
---
Dude it’s not that randoms are bad. Like these guys had no common sense. They kept running by all the adds leaving so many to live. I’m surprise we even took out the champions to be honest. They just shot the adds once then ran off while I was dealing with them. The boss fight really got me. Adds everywhere, boss shooting. These guys somehow kept running around surviving. I’ll give them that, they were at least able to survive but my goodness whenever I spawned back in, no progress on the boss or the amount of adds being killed.
---
You ever hear of arbalest? 🤷‍♂️
---
Tbh im not exactly sure if theyre lowercase Ls or uppercase i's
---
What's put DPS on the boss mean?
---
This is why I hate the Taken
---
This game is pretty trash smh
---
Don't sweat it, take me up on the offer and we'll have a fun few runs.
---
The hunter and titan are in the wrong frames.
---
Im down feel free to add me!
---
Grow up.
---
Just damage the boss. That’s pretty much it. That’s all I wanted these two guys to do. But they didn’t.
---
I have actually, and I believe that's why they didn't do that again. Too many complaints by people who got the gun to have people the following week get it as a random drop
---
This happens when you damage him to fast and take his head off (literally).
---
He then becomes immune until you take his shielded area down despite being outside of them.
---
You're playing momentum, everything wrecks in there. Not that impressive
---
Cool, what's your GT and what's your preferred play style?
---
Cold hard silver
---
Pikachu after visiting America for a month
---
Absolutely, finished and got the Revoker in Momentum Control, working on Randy.  Excellent game mode to finish these quest and Masterwork Suros regime, Vigilance wing and Jade rabbit.
---
Warlocks are such a letdown when it comes to class items :( plus most armor looks kinda the same compared to the other 2
---
Chinese names bro, obviously lag-switching
---
Okay you should have just been invited although it says you have no characters
---
Don't talk to me or my Son ever again.  
---
\*Screams in Crucible\*
---
Idk that's an interesting question. Sort of like a " the person who retaliates always gets caught" yet at the same time taking Ls like that in comp sucks ass
---
Question: what new content did they add that’s actually part of the event other than Haunted Forest, which is the same activity that was released last year?
---
You literally admitted elsewhere in the thread it was :|
---
Epitaph would like a word with you.
---
Actually nah, it already knows what you're gonna do.
---
"Light! Give your will to me!"
---
Go eat a cornonthecob.
---
You are awesome.  Thanks pal.  👍😎
---
[I've already seen this one] (https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/dipclk/this_is_fine/)
---
Ofcourse you do 😂
---
They wouldn't be if they didn't make you jump around so much and fly everywhere. The loading times for planets is just ridiculous
---
Yes stomp my ass at every game because you sit at home all day playing them. Omg I’m so scared you’re so good at a video game. Not like all these two players needed was common sense. I don’t give a shit how much you’ve done in the game. Idc if you need don’t know what’s going on. All I wanted these guys to do was just join the party chat or even listen to the one message I sent them and just try to go through with it. But nope still didn’t. So yes threaten me with you’ll stomp me at every game because wow being so good a video game makes you glorious.
---
Not sure what they were thinking when they said this mode focused on gun play and it has the least gun play in all of crucible since everything ohko’s.
---
H o w . Teach me your ways.
---
I know :( he couldn’t be bothered anymore afterwards xD
---
It's so amazingly, sleepily underwhelming it completely boggles the mind.

Justice served, go play fortnite kid

GT is:   im mr bulldops       not sure if theyre lowercase L's or uppercase i's though its bern so long haha and im hunter only pretty much knife barrage solar or  trapper void. Big on orpheus rig but still working on getting more upgrade modules to get my exotics up since ive only just started playing again. Can also play nighthawk golden gun but very rarely do i play arc unless i need it for bounties
---
If you solo it without dying
---
Now add a soundboard that plays the warmind intro theme
---
when they see a super? 
---
cant count on how many times i get yeeted into oblivion with that s#it just because i exist.
---
wish i got one glimmer, for every time a hunter solo ulted me.
---
"COME ON AND SLAM!"
---
This same shit just happened to me too. I don't follow their Twitter, so how was I supposed to know not to use the key after they said the quest was fixed? This is honestly some bullshit.
---
I mean, a few youtubers tested it in the last wish raid and it matches the DPS of thunderlord easily. Not to mention is staggers unstoppables.
---
You must complete the first frame she gives you until you get a blue cube, then return back to ada, and finally fo the forge
---
I just went through the top 60 posts on the sub and ZERO were negative. Just memes and helpful tips being passed along..........
---
Oh sHIT I forgot about that mod.
---
I got the key right after today's reset, but the quest is still bugged. Do NOT use the key. You will lose the key and the mold for nothing. Wait until they fix this mess of a questline for good.
---
Ignorance is bliss after all. Ok.
---
Turn hud off
---
Ditto, no!
---
This challenged tired me out
---
I mean I dont think crucible is bad by itself it awards those who go out of their way to get powerful weapons but the thing is new players will get crushed on it... momentum control came in as a hopeful fix for that but there's still a long way to go.
---
Same, gonna wait for someone with an answer
---
Man, I have been doing the Randy’s quest with mida. It’s going to be quite an adjustment not having that map up all the time.
---
same 😂
---
Master obviously
---
I'm slowly chipping away at the old quests I accumulated since I left around warmind. The glory crucible grind is not one I'm looking forward to since the few I've played move really slow.
---
:( that makes me sad since I use middle tree NS. Thanks tho
---
Is it worth it thought because they drop roughly the same things
---
Yikes dude.  
---
Do you call being able to breathe a success?
---
Do you celebrate when you kill a dreg in EDZ?  
---
When you complete heroic public even and receive a blue drop, do you run to reddit to create a post about it?  
---
No. You do not.
---
If you want to be efficient, just do the campaign or do *other* things that don’t reward powerful gear until you get to 900
---
"But big monster!..."
---
Imagine seeing this same post a thousand times.....getting old
---
I mean if you don't dance, are you even gambiting correctly?
---
Why? Makes it good, and it's only good in the weekly game mode.
---
Uh... you can't
---
Where it belongs!
---
I mean if you are confident in doing the 980 and can do it quick and consistently then do that
---
Also how to get masks
---
sorry man gotta rant somewhere
---
i hope bungo sees it a thousand times and finally fixes it lel
---
But.. Why?
---
I’ll probably stick to the 950 although I haven’t tried to speed run the 980
---
and make it do some clusters as well and then lingering effect too. would make us hunters survive panic titan slams
---
I mean I don’t what more I can do. The most toxic thing I’ve encountered is you. I’ve scrolled through tons of posts and have been checking constantly since new light dropped. Your insistence that this is somehow a negative sub despite this, leads me to believe this is a YOU problem.
---
I guess his right mouse button is broken.
---
You can go in with 2 friends. No need to matchmake.
---
I resent that.
---
I thought it was fixed this patch? I waited for Bergusia (today), got the key, inserted the key and ...nothing happened? (same as OP).
---
Anyone know any work-around?
---
Sorry, i ate it
---
You "can" go in, that's not a solution. There is hundreds of thousands of players who are primarily solo players. This is not pinnacle content, there is no need for absence of matchmaking.
---
You likely wont even have a download. Its already on your playstation as long as the game is up to date. When you purchase one or both, the download might be a few megabytes but its just an unlock for your account.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is how it was for steam. I downloaded the game and played it, then I bought forsaken and shadowkeep and there wasn't anything else to download. The consoles should be the same way.
---
If you have a Thin Line lying around use that, it's a void 110 and 110's one shot to the head in Momentum Control.
---
This taken was a hunter main in its previous life...
---
Ah yes (in my opinion) the most annoying damn enemies in the game. Taken just always teleporting away. As bad as Captains and wizards hiding behind something as soon as their shield is moderately damaged.
---
When you say Black Armory are you meaning to open the first forge (Volunder) or are you talking about the izanagi's burden quest line?
---
Damn... it looms like steph curry vs lebron out there
---
I NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED ITTTTTTTTTT-

Shadowkeep will only ever include season of undying so I would just say get it now
---
Can't wait to sit there with a rocket launcher and utterly destroy people's chances.
---
Yeah i forgot to say that it was an update
---
The first 1 is in the room you pick it up in
---
Bulltrue lol
---
This is requiem
---
Blessed pumpkin, join us brother r/fightinglion.
---
Look, not everything has to be best in slot. I do my fair share of the DPS phase with it every raid, it’s more fun than running Sleeper, Izanagi’s or prospector for the 100th time.
---
That is how I find them most of the time, if I can not see it I pop out ghost and he looks to where he needs to be.
---
As a titan main, I approve of this meme.
---
First forge. I don't have access to any of Ada's quests or bounties on the second character.
---
I sure wish I knew, just reset and re-allocated some 4 times to unlock the collection entries for every set, and that was the last set I did, for keeping. That was like yesterday.
---
Checked today, and either I missed it then or something else happened because it's like that, and I don't plan on resetting any further.
---
My Duke Mk 44 is 1HK, not sure about other hand cannons.
---
That’s cool, I’ll have to give mine a try!
---
Caught yourself some down votes from some hunters who thought they were the only special cloak wearing edgy boi in the universe.
---
I know this technically violates rule #15, but...
---
Yeah it’s broken. Every other post on here says that
---
Definitely am high but that's my opinion. Use what you like, I personally don't like izanagis. Sleeper still does good dps and outbreak in a group of 6 is dominant. Prospector is probably the most recommended boss killer around. Maybe you should get high and have a better opinion
---
it’s a known bug that i didn’t know lol put my final key in this morning and nothing. bungie said yesterday that they’re aware it’s still bugged and advises to not doing anything towards the quest until further notice.
---
Idk why people are saying you have a bad attitude, I completely understand and looking at the replies to the less toxic comments you seem irritated but fine lol.

Ik what u mean, me and my friend were running ordeal last week (savathuns song) now, I only got d2 wen it came free, my friend had it from before. Matchmaking gave us somebody who had NO UNSTOPPABLE OR BARRIER ROUNDS and he refused to pick up the void charge...my friend only had barrier rounds so I couldn't pick up the charge either. These people just need to learn what is needed. If u realise ur doing no damage to an enemy, shouldn't u at least try to find out what's happening???
---
Yare yare daze Titan baka.
---
This one thrall can do what the entire PvP community can't: Counter a Striker Titan.
---
I no longer use my Well of Radiance without my friends by my side. At least they know how to stay inside the well to get damage and shieldsn, and I get my super back real fast thanks to my Phoenix Protocol (tossing 3 Well of Radiances in a row is great)
---
Sing oh DeathSinger... Sing...
---
What gun is that
---
I wouldn't let them paw at the screen but cool picture.
---
Same thing happened before Shadowkeep, there's just more players now.
---
Did anyone else notice that the text for the subtitle options is the first line of this. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it.
---
The more things change the more they stay the same.
---
Tainted Black Armor was a random drop from fallen before Shadowkeep.  Go to Trostland and wait for the enemies are moving against each other in front of the church.  Kill all that arrive.  If it is still a random drop from fallen, that is the best place to farm for it.
---
You're the one who brought up the pootubers calling it great. I personally think it kinda blows. Ya know what they say about opinions......
---
When it first came out it was super broken, but now it's really just alright and mostly useful for shutting down enemy supers
---
Honest question, is Jade Rabbit meta now? Haven't done PvP in shadowkeep yet and if my pink sticker thing is toxic I'm not sure how to feel
---
Are you a new light player because sleeper is definitely not good dps and prospector is not the most reccomended the most reccomended is a 150 grenade launcher with spike nades and isanagis burden in the kenetic and recluse in the special. That has good boss damage and trashmob clearing
---
A DLC's content will only be available on the platform you bought it on. You'll be able to use all the gear in your inventory though.

---
Reminds me of Naruto
---
Ok Ulan Tan.
---
Dude i was just about to ask wtf is going on here lol
---
Carry me please!
---
Stand still ya little shit!
---
The recluse isn't really anything special in PvP.  It's just stupid strong in PvE right now.  I feel like a lot of people hate it because they're afraid to try to get it.  It took me an hour and a half to get 2100 glory this season, but when you look around on the internet all the info still says how it's a nightmare to get and some people saying it can take upwards of 500 games with a 50% win rate.
---
i dont have it on my map i guess i have to do some quest to open it.
---
Are escalation protocols still popular to do? Seems like every time I go to mars,on ps4, it seems deserted for me.
---
I have a rampage Duke, once it gets going 1 shot body shot streaks makes shaxx cream his pants. Got 5 reaper medals in 1 game earlier alongside finally getting the mountain top because 1 shot nade launchers.
---
I’m a Titan main and I fully agree with this post.
---
L
---
Sorry matpat not this time
---
Ada will give you a bow if you do the forge quest for it
---
Repive-2 "Viper" (2 because HyperViper in leet speak (e&gt;3 and I&gt;1 etc) is Hyp3rV1p3r - 3, 1 and 3, add on the 0 from your name and we have 3, 1, 3, 0. The average of that is 2.25, rounded to one significant figure is *2. Repiv* is just Viper backwards)
---
Learned the hard way eh? Don't push Brakion till after the 2nd cage. It has happened to guardians of all kinds since Y1 of D2.
---
Luckily? Lolwut there's only so many Pinnacle rewards
---
Being in a fireteam with someone on a destination will give you more exp when turning in bounties. There are exp boosts as part of the season rank system, so ideally you want to be with someone who has unlocked a few.
---
Ik same here
---
And this shitty quest is still buggued for me, i use the last key "black armory key" that i get in Bergusia forge nothing happens i don't receive the items for the next step.
---
I'm tired of this bs.
---
I'm wanting the Eyeball Shell (or a variant of it like Authorized Misconduct) so I can put a shader on it that'll make it look like the monitors from Halo.
---
"Back by popular demand, Candy makes its sweet return as a reward to be spent towards Mystery Grab Bags and the Braytech Werewolf Legendary Auto Rifle. After acquiring the fully Masterworked 950 Power weapon, create your own monster with random rolls." that's what it says in the festival of the lost news article from bungie
---
And only 200 bright dust
---
The nerf to bottom tree striker only effected me in solo PVE.  Can't get OEM buffs if another titan kills you in one hit.  Skullfort is metabreaking, and I love it.
---
The randoms were too dumb i believe plus Fallen are bitches
---
I miss my Stormcallers bond from D1, thing was bad ass
---
Yes
---
Holding on to my rare bounty for Izanagi's until they fix it is giving me anxiety
---
Pffft like there's any other form of Recluse user
---
True but gaining light levels through your artifact is much, much more efficient
---
Hard light ricocheting all over the place gets kills somehow and I love it.
---
Ohhh ok ok! Thanks for the tip!
---
This upsets me greatly
---
&gt;!spoilers!&lt; = thank u!
---
How bizarre
---
Instant sparrow? How do you get it?
---
 Stop crying
---
Look at this jade rabbit spammer, he's fired 3 bullets at me already.
---
Vexy milk
---
I know this isn't in crucible but I envision motes being replaced with bottles of lamb sauce in Gambit with Gordon Ramsey as the announcer.
---
The spider grenade launcher is the same as that. Some guns are shit doesn’t mean they are bugged.
---
Stupid Spider Tank
---
If the loot was on the floor it should be at the postmaster.
---
That’s rough, buddy.
---
“There are no countermeasures to stop a Gorgon”
---
*polishing Dark Drinker*
---
“What was that you said?”
---
Same Problem......
---
I spent 3 hours doing the black armory key mold and this happened to me, god im so tired to even complain at this point...
---
Yeah, that’s the one. I’m guessing the other bosses got buffed too, but idk for sure.
---
Is there something wrong with the pursuit of honor triumph because i keep getting multi kills and im not getting progress
---
That bastardised even hiding his critical spot on drawings! Great work though!
---
Hmmm. Try and make a new gaurdian or something, the. Transfer all ur gear to them if it works
---
dunno already at 3,5k and it never took more paints than it gives, and i lost a lot in that climb, Its easier to climb up now than before (berely made it to 1,9k solo) Bare in mind i didnt use the freelance option, even when going solo
---
Womp womp
---
If anything itll make them more money when people spend silver on ornaments to see how they look like with the shaders
---
Is The Last Word now a random drop only, or is the quest still available to New Lights?
---
Damn the Taken swerved harder then a friend zone crush on prom night.
---
tbh it should be Titan picking his nose at the back rdy to punch the nearest thing alive, warlock being all smart and commanding and Hunter being snarky and trigger-happy
---
i mean, an army of revenants with super powers that followed a shady faceless fraud of a religious head that didnt explain why we were doin anything aside from, "it's for the big ball and our survival"?  nah man it was obvious we were the good guys and not just another gray side being used.
---
It was painful to watch all that turned in without shared wisdom... I just kept screaming no, every click it intensified... it hurt deep in the soul. 😭
---
Bounties, especially weekly bounties and weekly "powerful" rewards.
---
Triple Down!
---
Crayons are what powers up the OEM
---
That Thrall mastered Ultra Instinct
---
There already are but uhh,not exactly that
---
*looks at bottom striker with thunder coil*
---
This gave me anxiety because of that. lol Like why?!
---
I would take the Jade rabbit Asshole over the Mida asshole any day, least when I get lose to the Jade Rabbit spammer he is screwed unless he switches guns, but a mida? Bunny hopping an hip firing like a hamster on crack.
---
Many people have. I haven’t even tried for it and I almost have it. It’s pretty easy if you play crucible at least somewhat regularly.
---
Oh I’m not saying it takes more than it gives. I’m already fabled 2 with only like 2 weeks of working towards it in the little amount I do play. I’m just saying the “you still get points if you play good and lose” rhetoric is wrong. It always takes points when you lose and it’s dumb, but it definitely takes waaaaay less than it gives when you win so I don’t really mind because I win more often than not
---
People have yes
---
Yeah I know, I’ll still check it out when Xur comes this week however I did read just now about the quest being deleted.
---
Ah ok
---
Tell that to everyone whining about Jade Rabbit
---
I'm not saying that sniping doesn't take skill, it's just that the revoker is way too forgiving that it consistently returns missed bullets to the magazine. That's like an exotic perk. If it had a chance to, then it would seem more balanced. I was using it in a game and I body shot someone who was lagging, killed them and got the bullet back from the perk. This seems a bit ridiculous.
---
That quest line is one of the best in the franchise, hands down
---
If you were high while playing this game, tell me. How scary was literally anything?
---
I use swarm and it’s quite effective especially with gl ammo finder
---
I praise them.
---
I mean hunters aren't bad but he's right that it's the most common class
---
GG 🔥🔥, I finally did it myself yesterday and I'm glad it's over with
---
0.74% of indexed players have earned Unbroken, though the true number is likely less than that
---
Should those of us who missed the first 999 times be left out forever? Reposts are not always a bad thing, people don’t see every post every time.
---
I have an ssd.
---
Still loads faster than the game
---
It was a pinnacle. It has a unique perk. It’s like a mini ice breaker. It. Just bypasses the ammo economy. That’s all. A good beloved player will still do better.
---
Why not just find a decent squad to run with then?
---
Punch punch
---
PROJECTIONS DETONATED
---
r/nicewarlocks
---
If you look at the Gamertag of the taken thrall you can see it is clearly asian and thus very capable of these pro gamer moves
---
I feel like it would be less just because they have to earn legend 3 times in glory, but there are pvp gods and “gifted” people.
---
Very talented drawing
---
Lol gz man. You are a hero already, u don’t need that shit.
