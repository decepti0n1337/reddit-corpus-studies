You are blinder than Eris, that‚Äôs obviously a rip off of red death
---
---
---
With our whips to keep the Hunters in check.
---
Yup. No power in the 'verse can stop my salty ass from bitching about things. 
---
Great idea
---
That's one hell of a grind congrats! 
---
I just made a hunter because I got bored of only playing warlock, this loadout has worked wonders for me:
---

---
Last word (from collections)
---
Stubborn Oak (it actually has good range)
---
Random rocket launcher
---
Dragons Shadow
---
I consistently dropped 25+ kills every game with it, it‚Äôs fun and an actually good loadout even though I‚Äôm using a white rarity shotgun
---
...indeed.
---
It's what I assume 99% of hunters look like lol, mine does but mostly because I like the look of Exo's.
---
I finished my 5 resets during Mayhem. I like it.
---
Nah that‚Äôs obviously Gjallarhorn
---
K
---
Or get the cayde-6 vanguard dare cloak
---
F
---
Your respawn timer was ready before you even landed. Jeeze.
---
Titan here, and I thought that would actually be a pretty cool gimmick, having one eye and all. Not so much the screen being black, but depth perception being gone.
---
Man all those hunters swarming mayhem with ‚Äúweak knives‚Äù
---
Destiny 1
---
On a Destiny 2 subreddit
---
Call the police
---
First of all, you might try reddit crucibleplaybook for tips.
---
Second, PvP in this game is literally, the most random, inconsistent PvP you‚Äôll ever play for a number of reasons.
---
1. Matchmaking, you‚Äôll get paired as a solo, with other sub par solo‚Äôers, against 4-6 stacks in QP, don‚Äôt even get me started in comp.
---
2. This game is P2P, there‚Äôs no dedicated servers. So Bungie/Destiny will randomly pick a host, based on certain undisclosed criteria, that could drastically affect your experience.
---
3. Bungie also uses certain net  code, that affects people with crap connections, and gives them an advantage to some extent.
---
4. Based on the above, expect that roughly, 50% of the time you‚Äôll be put in a match where it seems like your shots don‚Äôt register, or, you‚Äôll be fine against most of the enemies, but there will be 1 or 2 taking advantage of lag compensation that no matter what you do, you will be at a disadvantage.
---
5. The game in terms of weapons, certain load outs, are simply unbalanced. For example Titans, using One Eyed Mask, if you aren‚Äôt a Titan, and don‚Äôt have it, just expect you‚Äôll be fighting at a disadvantage. 
---
6. All this aside, understand, that no matter what you do, Supers, and Heavy, supersedes any amount of skill and gunplay. If you manage to overcome the above, and do well, you‚Äôll find the majority of your deaths are from Supers or Heavy weapons, of course depending on your team.
---
Point is, at the end of the day, there‚Äôs so much randomness, and things outside your control, that there‚Äôs just not much you can do.
---
Good Luck.
---
Nothing will change for us
---
I only have one reset to go... 
---
I‚Äôm not gonna sit here and list out perks when you can read them in game. If you don‚Äôt believe that hunters are the easiest and best PvP class then head on over to r/crucibleplaybook. Those guys can explain why way better than myself. Stop getting your information from a shitty meme subreddit where half the subscribers don‚Äôt have the brain power to counter shoulder charge. 
---
Pretty sure it's talking about throwing knives
---
Haha. A hunter complaining about anything at all hasn't played the other classes. And every flavor of titan has a 1 hit melee. Warlocks have a grenade from 1 tree of 1 subclass.
---
Cough* Cough* RhabbyV
---
That's cool, where did you get it from? 
---
Lolwut? It's an OK GUN. Let's not exaggerate haha 
---
I have all 3 characters?
---
Now that‚Äôs how you titan skate 
---
Little Light(?)
---
Thank you
---
Imagine if every PvP player would cry about that 90% of all quest has PvE parts in it. Oh then again we ain't bitches, we wouldn't cry about tiny things 
---
 Come at me weaklings in the PvE playpark
---
Dude I have all 3 chars, hunter sucks ass compared to the other.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs tedious but my glory years of PVP are behind me. Now I come home from work and just want to play a game that relaxes me, Crucible does the exact opposite.
---
Doesn't have full choke tho
---
GG for clutch in the end hehe. Nothing uniqe these days but very challenging for me :(
---
THEN PLAY PVP goddamn. Like stop fucking complaining Jesus christ. downvote my comment I don't care. But don't fucking complain if you're bad at PVP and just get good instead of being a little bitch. Last word isn't a pve weapon, don't expect it to be a pve only quest like a fucking dumbass. PVP is a part of destiny. Get over it. If you hate apes, become a fucking ape. If you can't do that then don't expect to get PVP weapons by doing mundane pve tasks.
---
I‚Äôm not going after TLW or whatever PVP weapons there were. I just play my matches for the milestone then bid that mode adieu. 
---
I‚Äôm a Hunter, other guardians were going to hear me bitch regardless
---
An argument implies that you made a valid point during all this. There never was an argument. 
---
THANK FUCKING YOU. finally someone understands basic human knowledge. I've seen too many people complain about the last word quest despite realizing it's a goddamn PVP weapon. It even is mostly pve. The events, crystals, boss fight, and much more are P V E. There are only 2. TWO tasks for PVP to get last word.
---
Then you should know how good Nightstalker melee is.
---
Red Death Redemption

I wish there was a bow you could reacquire from collections. I need a bow to do the bow frame but I‚Äôve done literally every possible source this week and zero dropped :(

You want beggars? Cause that‚Äôs how you get beggars. 
---
Smart guy 
---
would love for sunshot to get a buff 
---
Inserts "haha"?
---
Crytan main lmfao
---
Excuse me?
---
Spanish joke, look at the napkins. 
---
Whisper of the Worm is a PvE weapon, which is why it containers completing a very difficult PvE task.
---
Last Word is a PvP weapon, which is why it contained completing very difficult PvP tasks.
---
Malfeasance is a Gambit weapon, which is why it contained completing very difficult Gambit tasks.
---
Anyone who goes for a gun that dominates a specific area and expects not to be sucked into the world which it dominates in is in for a rude awakening.
---
?????? Breakneck is Gambit. Loaded question is strikes. And mountaintop is a PVP FUCKING WEAPON. same with Luna's and NF. they WERE MADE FOR PVP. You're a fucking dumbass. The 3/5 pinnacle weapons are PVP because they're goddamn PVP weapons. Get your head out of your fucking ass.
---
Transmat Firing!
---
Nice engram, how much silver?
---
This is a big flex. Why would you need The Last Word in-game if you can make one IRL. 
---
Well I don‚Äôt think Destiny was ever about PVP though. More so loot, raids, strikes and such. Crucible was always a side mode. It‚Äôll never leave and I get plenty of people do enjoy it. My unpopular opinion: Destiny in general might be better off without a PVP mode. Seems like Bungie dedicates a lot of time and resources to balancing guns, supers, sub classes etc because of PVP. If they didn‚Äôt have to worry about this aspect so much, they would have more resources to spend on designing guns and gear, quests, raids, all sorts of stuff.
---
Could you give us the original source?
---
What armor is that on the warlock?
---
Y thank you
---
And here these pve peasants are complaining because they can't kill a stationary target
---
But those three weapons still have a lot of practicality outside of PvP.  Or have you never even bothered to try using them in anything other than crucible?
---
Agreed, would be cool if they gave you a PVE or PVP option for each step of a quest
---
I‚Äôm literally the worst person at pvp in my clan and I got the chaperone in like a few hours it‚Äôs not hard
---
14 would be proud. 
---
Vesper of radius with transcendent geometry. 
---
You can call PvE a playpark  and wipe 4 stacks in competitive all you want but you won‚Äôt stand a chance doing a flawless Last Wish run.
---
Hunters run on 80% sodium chloride and 20% fuckmyithrewmyknife

Primeval is gone

\*crab rave\*
---
I was just shooting a hive Wizard when an exotic dropped. Excited to know what it is, i picked it up and got the Talon. Was disappointed until i tried out, and became the deadliest guardian who ever equipped talon in the crucible
---
I just have better things to do than sit here and list abilities that you yourself can read. 
---
It‚Äôs a bird! It‚Äôs a plane! No, it‚Äôs just a titan
---
I want my Mythoclast back.
---
Make your case as to why they're good neutral game. Seriously, if you make a claim, burden of proof is on you. Is this so hard to understand?
---
Oh yeah, it is. If it wasn‚Äôt, I honestly don‚Äôt see how they wouldn‚Äôt have a fandom uprising.
---
Is it actually five burst tooo üò©üò©
---
Any last words?
---
Isn't that the quest where you get 5% per kills and lose 1% on death? You literally need a .2 kda. If you can't manage that then idk don't get chappy? It's not great in PvE anyways.  
---
Did you record a clip? Mine fucked up when I did the built in recording thing and made me reset my one x. 
---
Call BS. Titans have 3 ways to 1-hit you, warlock have 1 way to hit you and hunters have 1 hit granade kill plus the infinite ways to dodge any and almost lethal attack.including supers
---
Since the launch of forsaken, shards is the only exotic I wanted. Now it is the only exotic I don't have on my hunter. Seems for me it is just not meant to be. Exotic drop rates suck
---
Your kidding right? It‚Äôs clearly last word 
---
Congrats

You‚Äôre taking all the good rng for yourselves üòÇ

Come on man it's obviously Ace of Spades

Now that I have another look at it‚Äôs clearly bad juju

Hey I have that exact same one on one of my bags

I know I‚Äôm about to lose a ton of karma for saying the right answer but... come on guys.

It‚Äôs Graviton Lance. Know your pulse rifles.

Seeing as you‚Äôve used all can you name the top 5?

---
Lw raid for the cloak, chest and gauntlet. Helmet is season 4 IB and the legs are stompee5. 
---
Why are people complaining ? Its just another gun you wont use anyways. 
---
Congrats! After playing comp today for 3 hours and not increasing in glory at all, i got nothing but respect for you
---
I seriously hate shotguns in this game especially in pvp. 
---
Wdym leave smoke bomb out of this, the hell? The whole point is about smoke bombs. Spectral blades has smoke bombs aside from other two, you think no one plays it?  
---
As for tether, idk why you'd go there but OK, as top NS you get invis on demand (in the age of oneshots and people trusting radar more than their own eyes), radar manip as secondary of snares, better radar, faster sprint, tether is usable, it sucks, but you can very much stop other supers with it, which I can't say fairly about something like Nova bomb, if you want an example of an actual trash super.

I got mine from GameStop. But I set it down to fix one of the rings and my dad threw it away. 
---
I wasn‚Äôt being a fucking dick you Bellend? Don‚Äôt assume what Someone is  playing on and you won‚Äôt make that mistake again? Huh?
---
Point is why are you crying about the OEM? If Hunters dominate Competitive PvP? Because you like to cry? Because God forbid a Titan gets the drop on you? Or is it that you just want to feel special and Mommy didn‚Äôt quite cut it for you?  
---
Maybe it‚Äôs that you don‚Äôt really want ‚Äúbalance‚Äù? Maybe it‚Äôs that you don‚Äôt want exotics to be powerful, and well...exotic?
---
Why not remove exotics from competitive PvP if they seem to be such a God awful travesty? You want balance, here it is: Everyone gets the same exact guns with the same exact damage, each player can move at exactly the same speed, jump the same height, strafe with the same quickness and take exactly the same damage? Then it‚Äôs 100% based on skill. No more excuses, no more tears, no more positive K/D either I imagine. 
---
But hell that sounds boring as all get out? Doesn‚Äôt it? So why not stop complaining about the one exotic that allows Titans to compete in PvP and learn to deal with it. That goes for Hunter exotics and Warlocks too. Everyone is so hell bent on ‚Äúfair‚Äù, ‚Äúbalance‚Äù, ‚ÄúOP‚Äù because it can‚Äôt be that player is actually BETTER than you?  So why not stop with the nerfs before this becomes D1 all over again. Because once they nerf OEM, something else will take it place in the nerfherder handbook......and it just may be you favorite exotic
---
P.S Remember all the cries of ‚ÄúNerf MIDA‚Äù it‚Äôs too OP??  
---
Most balanced exotic was OP? Funny how that just suddenly went away.....poof
---
I don't expect the entire quest chain to be super unique. Making that kind of content takes a lot of resources just to be done once and never again. But I would expect at least the last part to be something interesting, which they kind of did. It's not a new area but the quickdraw mini game thing was nice.
---
But I do fully agree that things like this should not be skill gated. As you pointed out, LH/NF are there for that. There's no need for TLW to be like that.
---
Yeet
---
Duh I totally missed the not ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I'm a hunter main and I don't complain about anything really.
---
Dude are you burning like a shitton of pewter or something
---
I got that one when I was doing the forsaken story but I ended up destroying it since I didn‚Äôt need it and you can‚Äôt reawuire it
---
HUNTER MASTER RACE
---
Luckily those were a bit more forgiving to me.
---
Your hunter looks really good
---
Xbox? 
---
It‚Äôs one single exotic that give Titans a fighting chance in competitive PvP!!! Although you go see how many Titans are top of the PvP leaderboards WITH OEM. Let me know if it higher that 4 or lower than 5? 
---
Once OEM gets the nerf button, they could be coming for your favorite PvP exotic. Let‚Äôs see how it goes. Some of us see what coming, we watched it happen in D1. 
---
If you're making hand cannons to sell... Do you happen to make Hawwkmoon? I'd buy that in a heartbeat. That gun was my baby.
---
I‚Äôll buy the pass for you if you send me that haha
---
Top 5? I'm sorry top 5 what?
---
Yes Hunter jump isn't the best jump in the game at all (for shotgunning, disorienting, and dueling)
---
Thnx!
---
Your top 5 favourite exotics.
---
Titan, can‚Äôt recall where exactly. Pretty sure it‚Äôs on the bottom level if u know what I mean. Like....kind of like going under a bridge part, and then walking into a small corridor and it‚Äôs a room offshooting from that
---

---
Brawler with Ophidia is pure sexiness.

PM store link please!
---
Does bungie have a help email? I have a problem with the game and I want to drop them a message to figure out a fix but I cant find anything? 
---
Yes, a space cowboy gun that you'd get for your space bounty hunter while flying from planet to planet mercing space aliens.
---
Which no one will use.
---
Ads
---
you can tell why 
---
Don‚Äôt you insults my precious knives, you son of a bitch.
---
I genuinely stopped playing Destiny because I kept getting new quests that forced me to do PvP. Same thing happened with D2 super recently. I get why they do it but I just wish they had the option to do either or. Give us a PvE and PvP task and then everyone is happy to play the game how they want too.
---
and the ~~weaboo~~ hunter cape
---
it‚Äôs the Malfeasance! y‚Äôall should get your eyesights checked out.
---
I want it. 
---
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **2nd Cakeday** AlmightyBenn! ^(hug)

The hardest decisions require the strongest of wills, like my curated tempered dynamo
---
Is that the iron remembrance helm on the hunter?
---
AM SORRY BUT GIVE ME THIS SHADER nadndnsksl
---
Undercover whorelock, get outta here.
---
What's that shader 
---
1k cuts with Brawler is just spamming RB. No guns necessary until the boss
---
I do play PVE outside of the weekly milestone. I stayed away from TLW quest since it‚Äôs PVP based 
---
Excuse thedumb question, but what do you do to get this?
---
Sometimes not even then. I main a Titan but I looooove my hunter in brawler days.
---
You need to forge 100 weapon frames. This requires the annual pass. 
---
Looks like some crazy lag
---
I'm not even sure how to forge weapon frames. I haven't played in a long time, a friend gifted me Forsaken lol. I sadly don't have the annual pass either.
---
Ah ok. I thought the perks might have a lot to do with it.
---
can throwing knives one shot on precision please
---
Sunrise warrior
---
*laughs in proper jumps*
---
I have Malfeasance but dont really want the title lol
---
Nice dude grats on the rare bounty :D
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEE.  I‚Äôve had this as my home screen for about 3 months
---
Yeah, maybe, but their trade is the best mobility in the game. Versatility wise. Just my opinion. 
---
Not knowing how hot it is where you live check the vents for lots of dust. Do you have a vertical stand? With fans?  Can you change the wall socket you are connected to? 
---
May be a bit off topic, but this is why I don‚Äôt want anthem to end up adding a pvp
---
Obviously then if they have the same sort of system it will require some sort of pvp play to unlock some aspect of the game which will just annoy us pve players even more
---
Hunters have the most op super out there. Needs another nerf
---
Judging by current operation it will be after the next real expansion (not counting the new content included in Annual Pass as expansions) is released.
---
Xur bounies are coming out too so maybe we can get soem Forsaken exotics there.
---
YOU WANT SONE STREAMER CLOUT ????
---
YOU WANT SOME STREAMER CLOUT???
---
Arsenic Bite is basically the bow that got me into bows. I love the star wars PEOW laser sound it makes as it fires.
---
Congrats! Im also on the sleeper nodes quest which I am putting off because of the grind. Being a family man does not have the luxury of time but I will get that gun one day! üëçüèº
---
‚ÄúLook how they massacred my boy‚Äù
---
But really it‚Äôs so much worse than D1 version, just feels way weaker and no ammo on top of that. 
---
If you're on pc we could party up. I imagine the help would be good
---
I always appreciate a well deserved 'bagging
---
Its A grenade. Not lots of one hitting grenades. One sub sub class that has been nerfed to uselessness :/
---
Well first you need the Annual Pass.
---
Thanks for the offer Guardian! I appreciate it. I‚Äôm on console unfortunately but will be planning to jump on the PC later in the year. We can link up then.
---
wow they straight up copied the suros regime 
---
warlock gang
---
I am not able to do the whisper as I do not have anyone to play with. But I will try for the catalyst
---
I like that he used a semicolon instead of a comma. Truly the mark of a master.

---
One could argue that the current best gear comes from the Black Forge. Get to 612-615 and you can easily solo queue through the 4 forges and farm out your preferred god rolls of your favorite weapon frames.
---
Ouch time!

---
A FUCKING LIE!!!!!!
---
Sorry man,english isnt my mother language, I'm still learning it every day... by my own because the french educationnal system is fucked
---
I earned the right to complain back when titans had a bubble and warlocks had self res and all the hunter had was a dinky little knife and gun. Back when nightfall/raid teams wouldn‚Äôt take hunters due to their lack of a way to help a team with protectionist buffs(we still lack that ability to help)
---
Or maybe it was back when I was told in a raid team my only use was to shoot Crota‚Äôs wipe mechanic with my golden gun + celestial and was promptly kicked when my super couldn‚Äôt load fast enough
---
Or maybe it‚Äôs the fact we still lack 1HK abilities despite most of our melee abilities being skill based
---
Maybe it was back when I was kicked from raid teams because my only use was getting people through the thrall run on Crota‚Äôs end with my tether   
---
Maybe it‚Äôs the fact that when forsaken dropped we got screwed over on our new arc subclass by getting a super with an ability that already should‚Äôve existed and we lost our vanguard 
---
I remember spending 7 hours trying to solo the sepiks prime nightfall because all LFG had was LF warlock or titan
---
What if instead of calling out hunters for complaining and maybe listen to *why* they‚Äôre complaining so much and get bungie to do something about it. we‚Äôve been complaining about a lot of shit for a long time and very rarely are we listened to, mostly were mocked for ‚ÄúGwIsIn Op‚Äù or ‚ÄúBlAdE bArRaGe Op‚Äù or ‚Äú[other class] had problems too‚Äù
---
/rant 
---
Idk man, warlocks got slapped hard last update, they should be the ones complaining until titans get OEM nerfed.
---
and b/c they have to use a sword to be the fastest class in the game, that's ok.
---
then how do they know it's scannable?
---
When you just barely dont get it and the same guy starts throwing accusations at someone for not doing enough damage but then hes in last place lmao
---
Files?
---
Lol. You summed up my raid.
---
I would like to add on the last part, nothing is cheap.
---
In comp use every little advantage you can, titan skate,OEM DRB anything, because if you aren't most likely you will face people who will.
---
Learn the patterns dont stick to one load out and call it a day, if you are facing a full team of lunas just know that they will lose every single long ranged fight.
---
Did they not lower how much energy gwisin gives back after a kill with the last update? Granted I think it was like a 3% nerf.
---
Amen
---
This is the main reason I stopped investing my time in destiny. It rewards you based on luck, not dedication 
---
Sorry man haha you're doing great
---
Damn you think so? I think it's one of the best  non-exotic red bar clearers in the game, even shreds most majors IF you can coordinate your output. I find it too unreliable without a rampage spec but I would never use one without it.
---
Why do you think it blows?
---
Not even counting the hit detection either. Spent half my super swiping past enemies instead of hitting them. 
---
how long did this take you to get
---
You don't have to have items equipped, the power level of item drops takes the vault into account. 
---
Yes I love it
---
REEE FLAME SOARD WITH 5 SWING OPPP
---
Please. You don‚Äôt know Black Spindle when you see it?
---
&gt;complained like my eyes were full of ants
---
Now thats an image i didnt need in my head
---
I will keep collecting and banking 5 even if we have enough to summon. I'll slam down five right in front of a 15 more collecting jackass for a summon. 
---
the one on the right looks more to me like Cerberus +1
---
No, don't really see it 
---
No 4 stack goes for 15 either. Fastest bank wins
---
Smoke grenade from hunter is op tbh
---
How many time will this thing get reposted 
---
Here is a fun trick, get someone to buy you a 40$ gift card and you are golden.
---
You are correct, It was nerfed by 3% super return.
---
Just ran with it and equipped auto rifle as I played. Didn't time it but what takes time is the 40 plays. The gun is so worth it.
---
I had back to back 50 kill games earlier today I didn't need his advice lmao, in fact if he wasn't a walking sack of free super energy we might have had a chance üòÇ 
---
You want it with the draw time masterwork. Use archers tempo in pvp as well.
---
Been playing since the beta of d1 and I've literally never seen a .07 before

Man ! I love you ! Finnaly someone who's supporting me

Thanks you, you made my day

I just got mine. Vaulted it because of my blast furnace. Congrats brother

V90
---
This is a reach

Just count to 5 and do it legit
---
God damn it.
---
Congrats buddy! I just got my first 650 last night and didnt realise there was no triumph for it, so congrats on getting all 3 to max!
---
That's how you bank faster tho... you clear and then instead of wasting time on bank you clear next wave until you're full.
---
Damn you. Take the upvote. 
---
Nice clutch! 
---
Tether and orpheus/spectral and gwisin hunter main here to say I'm just here to make my friends feel better about their damage output with my tether and shattering strike.
---
tbh the new Veteran emblem looks like shit, the last one was amazing.
---
Vortex grenades can be used in lots of situations. Baiting,  ambushing around the corner, holding heavy ammo/ capture points and even counter barricades 
---
Which warlock grenade one shots??
---
Do you understand you have to first charge the granade, then get shotgun close to your target and then hope he either don't see your or aren't carrying a shotgun, right? It's not just press Q to win. 
---
‚ÄúYou gotta pump those numbers up! Those are rookie numbers!‚Äù
---
I completely fail to see your logic.  You are telling me to look to a game that hasn‚Äôt even released yet for evidence of what, exactly?  The continuous post-launch development model of games is the relevant topic, but it‚Äôs really hard to talk about the continuous development after launch of a game that has yet to launch.  Whereas my example of Digital Extremes and warframe has years of continuous development under its belt.  I don‚Äôt think you could have picked a worse counter example if you tried.  You are just the kind of hater that wants to shit on Bungie, no matter what they do.
---
just PSA for the future, r/sharditkeepit is a thing :D
---
if youre just talking about melees, then sure, hunters have it bad, but dont forget literally everything else
---
oh, TIL how to find scannables.
---
I couldn‚Äôt find it myself. Thanks
---
&gt;en counter barricades
---
oh ya its a good area denial grenade. but on the damage bit its pretty sad when you compare it to other area denial grenades.
---
 I got killed 3 times in a row by the same titan supper. Not  3 different ones the one. Spawn and die.    It's pretty bad right now. 
---
Had mine finally drop last night from the Gambit weekly bounty. At first I was like, uggh Starfire Protocol and then I actually got excited. Hope yours drops soon‚Äîoh and I‚Äôm still waiting on Chromatic Fire and Shards.  
---
It's honestly so frustrating to get killed in one punch by a Titan 
---
Do u know the sauce by chance?
---
After finally finding my 3rd seed recently i was so bummed to find out it doesnt even 1hk
---
I AM THE BUBBLE
---
Did you know that in Kell‚Äôs Grave you can die by going out-of-bounds by going too high?
---
Yeah, a phalanx taught me that.
---
Yeah except this isn't the real world military where 1 or 2 good shots Dispatch anyone with reasonable armor.
---
The real world doesn't have massive health bar monsters that require what would be the equivalent of complete overkill irl in order to reach a goal.
---
Listen man, they're bad in PvE, that's been the consensus for as long as they've been available and the reasoning is very obvious, I'm surprised you're contesting this point just out of theory of "oh yeah but bonus precision damage good" 
---
The tbagging was for?
---
They also have to be up high and have a straight shot. Not very useful overall. 
---
I just hit 2070 and the biggest tip i can give you is to be honest to yourself. Is it really disconnects and bad teammates? Or are there things you are doing that are attributing to your losses? dying while sprinting, chasing kills, losing all your 1v1s, not sticking with your teammates, the list goes on and on.
---
For me i'm a strong player in 1v1s and quickplay but teamwork and playing my life were my big weaknesses. I put in the time to actively think about these things while playing and thinking about my own play when i died and what i could have done differently. 
---
The quest is tough and you will probably hit "elo hell" where you feel hard stuck and cant climb any higher but it only takes a couple lucky streaks to get past it.
---
Final tip and probably the most common is message people who played well or suit your playstyle. I met two random dudes and we went from 1600 to 2000 in an afternoon. The best part of that though was how much fun we had! The games stopped being about rank and just enjoying the game and seeing how effective playing as a team can be.
---
Good luck! You can do it.
---
I want this on a shirt 
---
Everyone I‚Äôve ever actually spoke to that has one says that it‚Äôs pretty good in PvE.  It‚Äôs your word against theirs, but I‚Äôm going to believe the people that I‚Äôve spoken with because I actually know them.
---
Yes

Mood

The Division had a cool "show" called State of the game. It was about half an hour every week. The developers talked about current issues and answered some questions live. Sometimes it was about some new content but mostly it was just about current issues and when the fixes will go live or why there is no fix yet. All in all a very informative show.
---
I think they stopped when they announced Division 2. Hopefully it will be back for Division 2 in similar fashion.
---
Example: [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/321203011](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/321203011)
---
Yep, I like PvE Destiny and still grind forges but Crucible just isn't fun. If I want pvp, I go to blackops 4 to grind skins there, or Apex, because those games feel much more fleshed out and fun when it comes to pvp. Crucible feels like alpha version of a game when paired with anything else.  
---
On the other hand, TLW is pvp weapon so it's not like I need it.
---
Try actually watching reviews on the weapon. Or hell, if you really think it's practical, go the extra mile and get it yourself so you can see how easily literally every other y2 energy handcannons annihilate in both damage, range, and usability. 
---
Absolutely beautiful dude, keep up the good work
---
Obviously the "son" was ironic
---
am hunter, hate PvP

Nezarec's Beloved Shell?

which we also have bad
---
I crutched my erentil all the way to lunas while solo queuing. Got it in 2 days. 
---
 For some reason ppl don't seem to use high impact fusions.. If its shotgun v shotgun then the better player usually wins.. If its erentil vs a primary, then the fusion wins even tho you might suck.
---
So yeah, try using a fusion, it's what worked for me and I'm really quite average 
---
yep . its a crimson days triumph. bugged . 
---
im on the fence about this but I do agree that shotguns need a range nerf.  Not all shotguns though, mainly the dust rock and retold tale, those things can be ridiculous. They feel the most consistent as apposed to a mindbenders. I love shotgunning and they are so fun because of how good they are, but when it gets to the point where it becomes the only seen secondary in the game and the most viable, it gets pretty stale. I have noticed a shift in the guns used in the crucible however, alot more snipers which is GOOD. 
---
I completely agree, which is why I queue by myself 90% of the time, and play in a fashion that's borderline solo. 
---
They pull it from the i game roster 
---
Don‚Äôt know if anyone will remember this but there is a dragon type Pok√©mon (forgot the name) that has that kind of blades on the side. I know it‚Äôs the third evolution and was introduced in black and white.
---
is it worth using without the catalyst? Ive tried using it and I shit the bed with it. 
---
Warloks 4 the win
---
underrated meme
---
Thankyou! 
---
At least this way all three classes have one shot melee capabilities. 
---
Also ties in with hunters being more of a precision class 
---
Not anymore. 
---
spectral needs a nerf, It is no doubt the most common subclass in pvp. Im a hunter main just for some clarity. 
---
Riiiiight
---
https://youtu.be/sSvYWVN5rTc
---
I'm just slightly ahead of you then with 18 matches to go. Good grinding, guardian :)
---
Well drawn and really good looking. Love it.  
---
Also it gives me an idea of a Sauron‚Äôs eye type ghost shell. Sadly I lack any sort of artistic skills xD but you have the gift, maybe worth a shot ?  
---
Regardless, I d kill for that shell. Good job ! 
---
Heart of Inmost light.
---
I mean I get what everyone else is saying here, but when it's like early or mid game is the worst. When it's time to summon I agree with the others on this thread, just fucking summon lol
---
*JUMPING MAKE ME MAD*
---
Hey... you didn‚Äôt get any shotgunners
---
No, because sunbreakers get better waveclear and melting point is a stronger debuff effect than tether, and actually increases power weapon damage, which tether isn't allowed to for whatever reason
---
Congrats! I'm at 42% for double kills and 65% for medals. Just started grinding last week so I think I'll have it soon!
---
Thanks so much for your kindness. Your idea is great, I'll definitely try something and keep you informed! 
---
Lol I think it‚Äôs both of us üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
If not a 1hk (which I can kinda understand with the range on it and not needing to get as much of a running start as a titan) at least make it do like 99% health so the cleanup is more consistently possible, or have it leave an AOE field like slam titans
---
Maybe smashing success
---
Too bad your 1hit melee will still attach and track through all those jumps and dodges, and your faster sprint speed will close the distance before they can get off the dodge
---
It's still quite good in PvE because of an AoE cleaning ulti and fast-to-no cooldowns of basically anything. 
---
[I prefer drinking alone.](https://shop.coles.com.au/wcsstore/Coles-CAS/images/2/4/0/240230.jpg)
---
Hunters have the slowest running and sprinting speed, and are alone in having no way to clear their momentum mid air. They got left out of the 'go fast' update back in year 1. "Most mobile" my ass
---
He was the decoy!
---
Those mods that make minecraft look real right?
---
I was exactly in the same situation as you a couple of months ago. Yeah, just do all powerful quests and you will get there. But... just buy Forsaken. It opens up an unholy amount of new content. If you already like the base game you will, for sure, like Forsaken. 
---
Just in case
---
Eh I better enjoy Riskrunnwr+Chaos Reach build
---
I meant my other comment in the thread, sorry.
---
this, exactly this, give us an option of completing it PvE style
---
I‚Äôm new to destiny, what did he mean when he said that? Is ace a person that‚Äôs died or just something else?
---
Maybe they will just remove the overshield. I think everybody can agree that would be fair. I think that would be fair.
---
Yeah and it's satisfying to shoot too
---
Yeah it is awesome thanks
---
Bungie should sue them over it. Since suing over dances is also a thing...
---
Emotional damage 
---
Pretty much summed up perfectly. I also play on PC so it might be different for us, but even according to [Guardian.gg](https://Guardian.gg) regarding win rate, 3 of the top 5 are titan classes.
---
Nova warp...new void bomb...the entire devour subclass year 1... Yes who is the scummy one now 
---
There are invasion kills that you have to do yourself though
---
Im a titan dont look at me hehehee
---
DUUUUN DUUUUUUN

DUUUN DUUUUN DUUUUUUUUUUUUN

Nice
---
Another salty boy post. Not a Titan main buy ya'll beat a dead horse with this one.
---
Yes PVP exclusive would be amazing because I love flying around planets at light speed lol
---
Slow rate of fire until you kill an enemy, rampage doesnt last that long, even with the rampage spec mod, low mag capacity.
---
The stability is good though. I will give it that, But just like Ace, it was not worth the grind.
---
Yes we are sweet thanks man!
---
ermahgerd stop it lol
---
Only 18 matches to go and I'll have it too
---
Son, the name of the game is nerf everything until nothing feels exotic anymore. Then back to square one vanilla Destiny 2. But you knew that already, right boy?
---
That is what I try to do in Rumble. Find a spot on the map in a corner with long lanes in front of me and have my blast furnace and Jotunn ready to go.
---
Just gonna say that I have farmed over 45 of them and have not gotten anything close to god roll. Let that sink for a sec...
---
Retiring my titan for a ranger, I'll see you guys when I find destiny fun again. Until then my ass will be flying around in Anthen.
---
There isn't a way to farm them.
---
You can only do the raid once per character, per week. 
---
I highly doubt Anthem will seriously impact Destiny, but I have no qualms if Apex 'kills' Fortnite.
---
This one‚Äôs been a right demon in Crucible, so it works for me.
---
I‚Äôm kinda the opposite. I got the curated Ringing Nail and I don‚Äôt much care for the shader. It looks purple in a lot of situations which really clashes with my dude‚Äôs color scheme (Mad Monk). I won‚Äôt replace the shader because I do like that its unique, but I prefer the standard BA shader.
---
Nova Warp
---
Us titans have slipped away from nerfs for too long now. Warlocks has their fun with Nova Warp, and Hunters had their fun with Blade Barrage. We are having fun with this until it gets nerfed
---
Hunters, we are the oppressed people. Remember the nova warps, the chaos reaches. Don't be trapped with the warlocks.
---
Actually many people say Destiny is already dead. If so then though, Destiny must be the liveliest undead game of all time, certainly doesn't seem dead to me.
---
Aww I meant sweat.
---
Dang it.
---
&gt;Destiny must be the liveliest undead game of all time
---
I'd imagine wow gets that title. Being dead with a few million subs
---
Thanks
---
Skating is not a problem on console, but fucking hell is one eyed mask everywhere in comp. I've been in a deficit for more than a week already cuz I get clan 4 stacks of one eyed mask, luna's howl, dust rock blues Titans almost every game 
---
I'm sorry about your divorce man
---
Too Late mate.
---
The Thunderlord was a bit unique in the sense that it was during the Holloween event.
---
The Last Word is not an event quest, so as long as you're carrying the quest in your inventory, it won't go away. There isn't a time limit.
---
It  will be a shiitier foetracker then 
---
I'm curious. Is the problem resolved by now?
---
the problem is whenever i go into crucible i feel like the game is playing against me.  i can unload an entire clip into a guys head and there was no damage.  similarly, i cast arc staff and hit the same guy the entire time while he hopped around and he didn't take damage.  then the thing i hate the most.  being shot at in a corridor, i dodge behind a wall.  according to the game, i didn't dodge behind there and i get killed.  i dont know whether to blame my crap internet or bungie's potato servers.
---
One is slow as fuck the other is almost instant.
---
Sparky cause why not
---
Shards was the last hunter exotic I got that affected super, and I got it a day after the nerf 
---
....I feel like I've met you. That exact scenario happened with one of my Hunter team mates. Invaded as we got invaded
---
Well it seems like I‚Äôm in the minority here, but I love it in pvp. Pve definitely has ammo issues. Pvp though, it has great range and absolutely shreds everything when the perk is active, including supers
---
Was in the middle of my super with my arcstrider hunter, saw some enemies and instinctively jumped over and smashed down with it. It was a pack of screebs, instantly blew me the fuck up
---
eh i just feel like you don't really need Devour all that much..
---
I enjoy more Riskrunner+Choas Reach Geo Mag Build
---
Because riskrunner kills WAYYY quicker in terms of just things in general compared to huckleberry
---
Seriously try playing titanfall 2. The movement system has been cut down a lot for apex, which is fine, but if you enjoy the sliding, you should see what its like with wall running, grapple hook slingshotting and bunny hopping. With titanfall 2s system, you could probably cross the whole apex map in a minute while still being smooth and clean
---
Oh look! It's me and my Tigerspites! 
---
Not like I need the sparrow and ship for Cursebreaker
---
Isnt it m.r.v.n though
---
Wow. I assume that is primarily from running a lot of Core Terminus?  And which god roll are you looking for?  Full choke, accurized, slideshot, snapshot, and range masterwork?
---
I'm curious how OEM will turn out after its nerf. Unfortunately I don't have one yet so I'm not that affected by it
---
Neserec Shell?
---
Sure it is dude . Just watch a lot of tutorial videos on Youtube  , plenty of them out there. You will get a lot of eye opening tips . That is how i got started . Not saying im a PvP god or anything but i can hold my own out there and enjoy myself.
---
Here is a easy one for example. When playing crucible go to settings and turn off the in game music , it serves no purpose and will only stress you out . Hell , even turn of Shaxx voice if you like .Do you really need him shouting in your ear when you try to land headshots on a Titan rushing towards you? 
---
Is it? It‚Äôs been a while.
---
I tried the beta for Division 2 as well. Found it... Boring and generic. Riot culture. No thanks.
---
No, you got your k/d lowered by someone better than you. 
---
Pre-Nerf Novawarp
---
Wrath Shoulders
---
Yesssaaaa. Titanfall 2 movement and controls are the best. I still play it once in a while. 
---
Haha I am already familiar with this bad news
---
Its playerbase went up massively with apex coming out. It takes seconds to find a match now
---
That‚Äôs usually me when I invade with hammerhead. 0 motes? Still ADSing on you.
---
AoS is just an average HC when compared to everything else.
---
Kindled Orchid, Luna's Howl, Malfeasance, Last Word, Trust.. hell, even a Crimson can be more entertaining than Ace.
---
Maybe I'm just not a fan of it because I don't like Cayde. He's forced humor, unfunny comic relief.
---
I got tigerspite from every dreaming city weekly this week except for 2 and I still don‚Äôt have the shotgun. Maybe we‚Äôll have better luck next week
---
The dull colored opaque stone and translucent crystal contrast really nicely. Looks like it could fit in the Dreaming City even.
---
Well, Luna's/NF are broken AF, but that doesn't make sense given the heavy grenade launcher and the sniper rifle.
---
There's no way my connection is at fault, it would be the server or the enemy's connection. I play on PC with ethernet to 1Gbit fiber optic. 120hz/FPS with 1000hz keyboard and mouse, so I'm at the lowest possible internet latency and input latency.
---
I never thought I‚Äôd say this but I miss Walmart now 
---
Some say he went on to equip it, take the invasion portal every chance he got, and shit on everyone on the enemy team from 2000m away
---
ook ook
---
I'll give you an analogy you might be able to get.
---
You can throw a frisbee farther than a bouncy ball most of the time, but it's easier to shoot a frisbee than a ball.
---
In the end, it was the publisher who was the real monster.
---
&gt;My go figure has outlaw rampage.
---
Not sure why you made this post then, lol.
---
Knowing my luck, I won't get it till after the nerf.  You other titans enjoy it while it lasts.  
---
-A titan making do with synthoceps/skullfort/doomfangs
---
Thank you so much! 
---
You mean you don't just throw both your knives then Dodge to get them back ad infinitum?
---
i dont understand all the fuss about how a hunter is the most difficult to play, takes the most skill, etc.
---
a warlock takes skill to play.
---
ive never played a titan but id assume the same. lol i think any class requires skill. 
---
Haha I haven‚Äôt gotten a chance to take a shot with it yet. Used this game to take a break from the Luna quest. 
---
I would honestly play more PVP if it wasn't for the supers. Like why would I want to get easily one shot by a heavily auto aimed hand Cannon...
---
We cheesed unfortunately, but our sherpa did explain there were actual tactics. Maybe one day.
---
Guess who goes to Walmart a lot jonvuke? Chanceeatsjalapenos i shall reply back !
---
Thought you were flipping me off and about to ask how to do it lol
---
How do I get this weapon
---
I mean, i still dont get the whole pen/ant thing, but going on the fact one of the first timers learned it and we got past that encounter after the 2nd attempt, im sure its simple once understood. 
---
Gotta say thats the fastest encounter we did compared to the others.
---

---
Crap. I completely forgot I wanted to farm for that this week.
---
nm
---
Oh the curated one does not have that fourth time's the charm anymore. It got replaced by zen moment :/
---
Ahhh nice. Feeling the Bungie love like that one time I was doing Shuro Chi and Gwisin vest dropped mid-encounter. Of course I swapped everything right then.
---
Fair enough maybe it‚Äôs just rng luck but I thought it could be a little thing bungie put in just to make it interesting 
---
No 
---
Ummmm I guess so?
---
I got mine from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Funko-Blind-Bag-Keychain-Collectible/dp/B07DFBSVF3/ref=cts_ap_1_vtp). You get a random one.
---
Jump around, heavy weapon, Ikelos if your quick.... or a Golden Gun to the face, that will blow them away.
---
I recently got rid of PS4 pro and went to Xbox 1 X, but anyways, I used to play D2 on PS4, now that I have an Xbox 1 X for the 1st time, I never played Destiny 2 on Xbox 1 yet, so here is the questions
---
Is Destiny 2 worth buying now at this time? Are there still lots of players ( on Xbox 1) ? 
---
And here is a question I need answered for sure...
---
The Xbox 1  store had Destiny 2 : Forsaken - Legendary collection for $59.00 ( lot of money ),
---
It does come with Destiny 2, forsaken, curse of Osiris, Warmind. ( year pass ).
---
My local GameStop has Destiny 2 legendary collection also for $29.99 new
---
And comes with same stuff but no year pass. Is there a way to get Destiny 2 with year pass and all expansions cheaper without having to spend $70 or more? I sure don‚Äôt want to spend that much money..
---
&gt;not as fast as Nova Warp was*
---
ftfy because you seem to have forgotten that people like you got nova warp deleted, and yes, it does have **the potential** to last forever, i didnt say it would every time
---
Ive gotten all mine from Vangaurd strikes, I am only missing the RiskRunner.
---
That said how do you get the crucible ones to drop I have never gotten a single one.
---
Ikelos shotgun. You get it on a specific week as the reward for completing Escalation Protocol, except even it rarely wants to drop. I've gotten the Ikelos sniper, the whole armor set, and finished the Worldline Zero Catalyst (beat the shit out of all 5 escalation protocol bosses until the progress increases, which takes a minimum of 5 weeks to complete) and in all that time that dumbass shotgun still never dropped lol. Or that SMG but who cares about that lol.
---
"See you tomorrow, Mr. Pocket!!"
---
You can't really compare gunplay in a fps and a 3ps in my opinion, Destiny will always feel better.
---
Agree with this except, depending on situation you can strip the oversheilf from OEM before he kills you. 
---
How many runs? A buddy and I did about four runs at 150k last night but didn‚Äôt see any at all. What should I expect to be in for?
---
I think he was making a joke 
---
It may only be EA but their last 3 games where trash (they where battlefield five battle front 2 and fifa) the only thing EA cares about is money money and more money they dont care about their games or developers
---
I‚Äôm on the last part :[
---
Took me about 10 of them or so to get full choke, accurized, slide shot + rampage and a range MW...keep at it :)
---
But doesn't he just get a new one if he kills me ? 
---
Them being transparent about the content just wouldn't work no matter what because again haters believe what they want to believe. Bungie could have done that and outright said everything is subject to change based on your feedback. But people just wouldnt care because they are haters. You cant expect lowlifes to act logically especially when their many goal is purely to shit on a game. And next thing you know just like anthem misinformation about destiny will be spread by haters and shit will reach youtubers those youtubers will report it as truth shit on it some more. Then the comment section will join in and next thing you know people will not buy it then shit just flops. 
---
Hunters are the only bitch class. They literally haven‚Äôt stopped bitching since vanilla destiny. 
---
No??
---
No they are just haters hence the entirety of the creation of the word haters because all they do is hate. From gaming to politics if a hater has an agenda to shit on something constantly you think facts or logic are going to stop them you think they are going to say oh ive been proven wrong now i will love this thing ive been shitting on for years. If you honestly believe that happens you must be extremely innocent in underestimate the hate people can accomplish. You are literally trying to fight a concrete house with a wooden stick at this point. Haters if anything they hold on to their ideals the most logic and facts dont even exist to them unless it helps prove their point and continue hating.
---
I have now read your stupid hyperlink.  I honestly don‚Äôt see what you‚Äôre talking about.  If people are going to complain about things costing money, then transparency won‚Äôt make a difference.  I fail to see how that relates to transparency at all, or how transparency would exacerbate hate like you claim.  
---
Nope.
---
Please read the rules before posting. 
---
Maybe 
---
Yep
---
I just got my second lemon from Volundr forge this morning while forging a powerful frame.
---
Why exactly does it need a nerf? Cause you get killed by them a lot?  Then stop being a lil bitch and change your tactics.  Tired of these nerf posts. Nothing needs to be nerfed cause nothing in this game is overpowered.  People are just better than you are with it.  Get over it or get better
---
Sure ya do, champ.
---
&gt; because the last word turns you into a literal fucking cowboy and is fun to use, 
---
And 1K voices shoots the screams of a dead god and Whisper is an infinitely firing sniper rifle. A majority of the rewards in this game are pretty fucking cool and guess what? The majority of them are available exclusively in PvE content. It would be much easier to make the argument that PvP players are "forced" into PvE since you can't even progress your character through PvP alone as much as in D1. 
---
&gt;all Meta builds and tweaks, nerfs and buffs, mostly come from PvP with the occasional glaring issue being addressed in PvE, hell even then it's usually a side effect of PvP tweaks, if they told PvP guys to shut up for one update, PvE would be so much more better for it
---
Clearly you have no idea what you are talking about. They adjust weapons differently (ie: The telesto damage change was in PvP) and the meta is clearly different in both. This is exactly what I mean though. The disgusting "PvE-only" victim mentality is ruining the community. 
---
&gt;you wouldn't want to be away from PvP long enough to learn to do a raid, so you don't care,
---
Also you still haven't posted your raid completions yet.

Good News - I actually got it on my first run.
---
Bad News - It got 'fixed' a few days earlier.
---
Cancer
---
&gt;D2 is on its way out, but not in a bad way.  September will mark the third and final year for D2 assuming it continues following D1's lifetime. Which mean Septmber 2020 should bring us D3
---
There's several things most people for some reason completely ignore when it comes to "D3";
---
1. There's no contract that forces bungie to even work on a third title anymore in the first place. They had to develop more games because they had a contract with activision to develop a trilogy of games - that got dropped entirely with the split.
---
2. Bungie mentioned just recently that they want to work on more stuff for D2 including older gear, raid ornaments, more visual options and even including more things we had in D1 (like the last word; there's already more than just thorn ahead of us). It would make no sense adding all of those from D1 to D2 if they plan to just drop D2 after that and keep on going with D3; They would run into exactly the same situation pretty quickly.
---
3. Bungie also stated that in terms of future terms they are looking for paths D2 could take, more things they can add to the game and other things. There hasn't been **a single statement** that even mentiones dropping it.
---
Yeah, I typically switch somewhere around 15 batteries in (when I know the team is doing well and doesn't need my ideal loadout). My default heavy is the Hammerhead, so I get 9 shots with Whisper when I switch (3 would be enough usually, but ideally I'd want to miss a shot or two if necessary).
---
Nice, put a rampage mod in it and have fun!
---
Bungie confirmed the exact opposite, that your *highest* score as measured by your emblem is what applies, not your score on the current run.
---
So why bother with them at all?  I still don‚Äôt see how transparency would somehow exponentially increase hate like you say it will.  Yes, there are haters.  Yes, they will hate.  But I‚Äôll be damned before I let haters stop me from trying to make things better.  You can fold in the face of hate like a coward, but I‚Äôm not afraid of a tiny minority of salty bitches.

Certain times of the day or week are better than others. I found Sat Morning were my biggest win streaks. 
---
They don't really need a  nerf tbh
---
Except they don‚Äôt 
---
Because thats misinformation all anthem dlc is free and the devs have been transparent of that and yet people like that still exist because again facts and logic dont exist for haters. Thats the main point im trying to make no amount of transparency will stop that whether its destiny anthem or some other game people will still find away to spread misinformation in the hopes of causing hate. Another good example is apex legends shit released under the radar and no one and i mean no one is hating on it. Because the devs didnt give people the time or ample information to create that hate. Shit even has loot boxes and people still praise it primarily because of its under the radar launch no one was able to make clickbait post on reddit or youtube of hating it or liking it. All they had to go by was purely from what was released. If you at this point in time still cant understand the dangers of transparency on a game then thats on you. Im neither saying it shouldnt happen or that it should just telling you if you truly want destiny to succeed this isnt the way to go about it. So im just down now in 6 or 7 post into this and cant be bothered anymore.

Because so far beside a few posts (by sides like GameRant) there hasn't been a single actual post by bungie stating this afaik. Every single time people ask on the forums, the only answer they get is that the different tiers (30/60/110/200k) do increase the chance on that particular run - not a statement that mentiones it working for all runs from there on.
---
Don't dead open inside

Ive completely stopped playing destiny in favor of apex

Btw they're called hand cannons

The Fireteam Chat podcast on youtube talked about this a little. It would be *possible*, but as you can see people don't seem to want it that much. 
---
I have an alexa myself but i dont know how to make these. Dan someone teach me?
---
Yep. I didn't even want the gun too much. I wanted the story.
---
If it was JUST for a gun, I would've left it alone. Like I did with Luna's Howl, Redrix's Broadsword/claymore, Not Forgotten, etc.
---
Instead you watched a pile of steaming turd. That's a few minutes of my life I'll never get back!!
---
I have the same issue...I can't even seem to get the mellee box to fill up to be able to use it..??? Why is that???
---
Yep been getting that too 
---
This is literally any gun with a decent roll on it.....I have a problem.

How can EA have "learned their lesson" after destroying Fifa and all their other sport franchise titles with insane loot boxes, to the point where they were being sued and banned from other countries for the actual, factual gambling it is?
---
EA doesn't learn shi\*. Ever.

Needs changed to 40+ runs, please someone send help. I'm also missing the tyranny after all these runs.
---
I was interested until I did. Meh.

scariest thing I've seen all week

don't get me wrong I have 53 exotics, and that works out to 5.4 hours played per, you're at 5.6 hours played per, but mine are all from xur \\ exotic quests, aside from the two exotic engrams I have had drop.

At the risk of being "that guy" I've been keeping up with Anthem since the before the first demo. 
---
All content in Anthem will be free, aside from cosmetics, so I'm not sure what staggered release has to do with it, aside from the obviously shitty "pay a sub and log in a week earlier" part. 
---
Also, there aren't really any 'last minute changes'. What we played in both demos was versions of the dev cycle that are behind what they already had for launch. Far as I can see, there haven't been any huge changes, other than QOL stuff. Perhaps I missed something, though.
---
Wow i want it ... Can u make a mod of it ? 
---
This was my experience as well. I was so underwhelmed.
---
I get more pissed when they join and DON'T answer my damn party or chat invites. That shit irritates the hell out of me... Why join the app party??
---
Does the badge require the Niobe Labs emblem?
---
Have you ever used OEM? That‚Äôs a terrible idea. The only nerf necessary is reducing the time enemies are marked. Increasing damage threshold for it to proc will make it even less reliable, and it‚Äôs already not reliable in proccing.
---
nice to know I‚Äôm using the same gun as the terminator 
---
Sword art online. Cool concept, poorly executed. Still, if you like watching an RPG unfold the first season is entertaining. 
---
oh yeah its full on 3ps apart from the times youre walking around in the city
---
Ngl, I tried playing Fortnight and PUBG back in the day and hated both of them. PUBG had an awful movement system imo, and the animations were garbage, and fortnight had that cancerous building mechanic that turned firefights into building-spamming wars. Both suffered from 3rd person perspective that I feel really detracted from the enjoyability of their combat and gunplay.
---
Apex is the first BR game that I've well and truly enjoyed. It has a first person perspective with fluid movement mechanics and includes a number of characters with unique skills that compliment rather than detract from its combat. I've popped a smokescreen between me and an enemy team before sliding down the hill through the smoke and dropping one of their players on the way out the other side. I've tossed down a shield to protect my team from enemy fire while an airstrike rains down on us. I've had my team forced to make a tactical retreat by having our wraith put down a portal and high-tail it to a nearby building before reengaging the enemy from range.
---
I say all this to say that depending on how Apex handles their game going forward, I *definitely* think it's going to be giving Fortnight and PUBG a run for their money. Fortnight, of course, has more of a culture around it that extends beyond just being a BR game, so it's certainly not just going to drop dead overnight, but I think that if Apex continues to do well, expands into solo and duo modes, and focuses on adding new maps and content, it will easily become the go-to BR game for people who are simply interested in an enjoyable BR game and don't care about the skins, the dances, the aesthetic, and the cultural value that Fortnight has produced.
---
Of course, your meme is still relevant, but I just wanted to throw out my thoughts on apex since it was on the table.

---
I'm embarrassed to admit that I don't remember this one. Halo 2 or 3? 
---
I grew up with Halo, so while some quotes are engraved into my brain, other parts are just foggy, distant memories.
---
Outside of that? Try Acrius or Tractor Canon. I'm not sure if the can penetrate it but Tractor has a supression effect and Acrius an overpenetration effect. Both should, in theory, destroy or ignore it.
---
Not sure if it was tested, tho
---
uhhh... i dont play PS4, but im sure it's possible. I'm sure there's plenty of other PS4 players who know how.
---
If anyone plays on PS4, help this man!

I have two dukes, one for PvP and one for pve both masterworked

idk if it's a coincidence but I remember it started dropping after finishing one of the DLC storyline missions but I don't remember which
---
Thank you. I'm not OP, but this is good to know
---
Ah, gotcha. Thanks! 
---
&gt; Granted, they will probably bundle the older content, like they did with D1, but it wont be free.
---
That's your assumption only. They could very well just bundle forsaken with the content of the current season pass, release a new expansion like forsaken and a season pass after; which again get's bundled together once the season pass runs out. Look at how GW2 handles expansions for a good example on why your examples makes absolutely no sense for bungie to follow in the first place. You are also ignoring the fact that from a financial standpoint; Starting with a new game that will net them less money vs a expansion (given the amount of people who would stay with D2, simply drop destiny in general, don't want to start over and so on - just look at the start of D2 for examples) while being significantly more work.. doesn't make any sense for them in terms of profit. Even including the base game with new expansions would mean they make more money compared to starting over entirely - which is exactly what more and more games including most of the highest ranked by avenue titles do.
---
&gt; Splitting from Activision just gave them their freedom back for their game, but it doesnt mean they're gonna change everything. 
---
Except that they already stated that they wanted their "freedom over the game" back, exactly because the plans activision had don't mix with their own plans for the game.
---
The point is; Selling pure assumptions as "what will happen next" and defending them, makes very little sense.
---
I mean, the Fanatic keeps yelling at you for being a murderer.  It's only fair that you be sent to Baron Jail.
---
I got my 1K on my first run
---
I saw a video of the lava lamp one, so there is certainly a way to do so
---
The kindled orchid hand cannon has huge potential to the best hand cannon around with the right roll, it‚Äôs definitely one to go for, same goes for the  blast furnace pulse rifle, and strikers hand sword, really each type has something for every player out there, those are just the ones that have gotten a lot of attention. If you have a weapon type preference look into what rolls are possible and grind them out üëç

What‚Äôre the rolls on the mask? Mine‚Äôs got a bunch of conflicting ammo and targetting perks that just don‚Äôt work together lol

I once killed an invader, then got sniped by a taken knight. I lost 15 motes.

A Warframe update, Halo 5, Division, I've even heard people saying Fortnite would kill it... and now Anthem. 
---
Oh man so that's how Germany felt when Italy joined them in WW2.
---
It‚Äôs an understandable confusion. Gunslingers are not Hunters. Gunslingers are Gunslingers.
---
I‚Äôm just now getting into endgame, I only started playing two weeks ago. What is this in reference to?

Everyone's entitled to their own opinion, but the full game isn't even playable yet.
