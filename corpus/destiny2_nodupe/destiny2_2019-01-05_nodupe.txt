my favorite thing ever on my hunter is Better Already or that other health perk on your class item

---
pair it with a masterworked gun and it's free heals all day

---
edited it to have full explanation without need to watch the video
---
Im the second comment, as soon as I saw the first question I was gonna comment the same drifter quote but the bastard beat me by around 30 minutes.
---
The difference is that CoD has had about 10 separate games to change and hasn't really. They're successful though, so I can't blame them. 
---
edited it to include all talking points without need to watch video

The daily Heroic adventure today, the cliff~ something 
---
You‚Äôre not wrong...but the Dunemarchers are my favorite Titan exotic (currently), and they‚Äôre amazing. 
---
I mean, it would be nice if Xur started off 2019 with Forsaken goodness, but it could‚Äôve been worse. 
---
it's for the diamond run
---
It was a last season quest. If you had it in your inventory when the season ended you could still complete it. If you didnt have it or deleted it before the season ended you're out of luck 
---
F
---
Well, if the first invader already passed and they aren‚Äôt close to the next one... I don‚Äôt see why not. 
---
As long as it isn‚Äôt Kell‚Äôs Grave. Worst. Map. Ever.
---
Sanguine Alchemy is garbage
---
What clan ? And u have space in ur clan? I wanna join
---
Just imagine also doing malfeasance 
---
Does this mean Cayde is Kirito?
---
Decided to enter a game of Comp too find my lone self against a four stack... I attempted to make friends with high fives and chest bumps, however they refused my advances, so I decided my KD wasn't worth it and left.
---
I got Ikelos shotgun, orpheus rig and tractor cannon from a single EP boss today
---
It was definitely more fun though. 
---
I only ever used No Backup Plans when I also had Immobious (that Defender Titan-specific Shotgun that...I think automatically reloaded when inside an Armor of Light Ward of Dawn) equipped. 
---
Extremely niche, but very fun when there wasn‚Äôt a Nova Bomb or Golden Gun coming towards me. 
---
Thats only for power lvls not exotic drops anyone under 600 will get higher light and get more often powerful gear
---
Well i find PvE content in Destiny 2 boring &amp; I hate when I have to play it to unlock a weapon. I push through it anyway until I get what I want. Sometimes you just have to do what‚Äôs required if you feel like you really want something. I don‚Äôt have Ace on my 2 alts because finding the Cayde stashes again sounds less fun than watching Destiny 2 install. If the grind isn‚Äôt worth it then the weapon probably isn‚Äôt either. Trust me, if you‚Äôre not a PvP player then you aren‚Äôt going to be using Ace that much. 
---
That‚Äôs hot
---
Nice. They are adorable at that age.
---
Ah a true man of culture. A guardian who watches Game Grumps lol
---
The prime is the closest one with the purple static coming off of it. 
---
I have the same roll. It is AMAZING!!!
---
Used the insta 30 then grinned crucible n gambit
---
Sorry, I meant Rat King.
---
Keep grinding guardian ü§ôüèº 
---
Only if you have breakneck already :]
---
I almost  lost fun i D2 but a good friend joined us Guardians a week ago.
---
Havi' n so much fun with him, so we got thru nearly  everything this week 
---
I cant wait for the Throne next week üòÄüòÄüòÄ
---
I am salty that people kiss each other in asses for a flex that is as easy as breathing.  
---
Be realistic.  
---
Wow, so he‚Äôs basically a wanna-be hacker talking out of his ass.
---
And they'd run right by the bank to get to the next spawn only to pick up the mote, turn around, and realize there's 5 blockers and then the invader shows up. 
---
Agree but still no witch hunts 
---
What emote is that
---
RnGesus has bestowed a blessing upon you.  
---
It does send the blocker. After a teammate deposited his bunch and we summoned a primeval, i invaded and saw the enemy team shooting an ogre. Easy targets standing in middle to shoot at in that Scorn map (dunno the name)
---
No
---
Probably just used the enhancement core consumable, they drop like legendary engrams. 
---
k, cause it kinda feels like it
---
Oh yeah the division 2 is also very hyped for me as I loved the the first one, third person matters none to me
---
It's well known the Destiny is MLG level shit and requires 101%
---
Siviks isnt even in the raid
---
It doesnt
---
There's definitely some aimbot on pc, at least in PvE, but I get some insane headshots in Crucible with Ace and trust me, I do not have enough skill to be able to do that.
---
I attempted it solo few times, before giving up on it. Was so frustrating... didn't even get that far at all, and even had problems with other two folks during the last phase... it's brutal.
---
Although i want to do the Shattered Throne solo, after i get max light level. There's a triumph for doing so, sounds cool enough for me to do it.
---
Yeah, it's from eververse 
---
like honestly try to convince me otherwise i'm all ears lol
---
No 3 smugglers word and a vigil of heroes
---
1 - the clip should be the whole encounter, too easy to get the boss down to low health and get 3 people to leave 
---
2 - your recent games show that 6 people where engaged in the raid 
---
We got a Cabal ExcavationüòÇ
---
Not anymore 
---
except fortnite
---
Don't understand why people are doing that. I feel like winning could be sometimes even faster than delaying the match stupidly.
---
After getting shitted on in a million gambit matches by it, Queenbreaker dropped today off of a red bar mob.
---
So far the lowest kills I've gotten on invade with it is 3.
---
It's nice to have a weapon pre-nerf...
---
I got 3 exotic drops in Scrooge tonight... Never had anything like it happen before. (although haven't had exotic in 3 weeks)
---
Haha can you imagine how ugly that would get..
---
*Sleeper simulent intensifies*
---
It‚Äôll be a little while longer then m8 I feel you
---
Yes and chyl üòÅ
---
The joke is that the weapon has all the rolls that OP wants (maybe Rampage / Outlaw for PvE, or Kill Clip / Outlaw for PvP) but it also has a highly desirable shader which will give OP a title if he obtains it. The only way  to obtain the shader is to disassemble the item. So, OP either gets to enjoy his super awesome weapon, or destroy it and enjoy his super awesome title and shader.
---
Last week was doing resource trading. Simulation Seeds. Got three exotics and a ton of legendary in about three hours. Ran Leviathan that night. Think I ended up with 5 exotics. Three of which I already had gotten though :(
---
Haha i feels ya on the luna grind. Ps4 also. Add me MarkEgatts... My clan does multiple raids several times a week. Ur more than welcome to tag along
---
yeah idk what he was doing there. probably just excited from the play. its happened to me, too, when i make a sick play and stop to record when i could just keep going.
---
Just wait till you do your first raid and everyone fails 100 times. 
---
Spongebob theme 4 hours later...
---
Eh it‚Äôs not that good lol I been testing it for the last hours. Still enjoy my bygones, blast furnace, and dust rock in that slot way more 
---
Run to spawn...cower behind titan wall..
---
Kk ill hit ya up one day, i stay in off line mode often though so you might need to ask if i want to tag along
---
Check out our #Destiny2 clan!https://www.bungie.net/en/ClanV2?groupid=3674911
---
If you want to join our clan 
---
Nice
---
I got a response once, I asked the dude "so you playing or what?" And he said "yah" and continued to do nothing.
---
I mean... He did told you to bring a sword.
---
I like to teach LW to people who haven‚Äôt done it. Seen a couple of people get it, it‚Äôs pretty cool.
---
Then afterwards I shut off my ps4 and sit in a nice dark corner because I still don‚Äôt have it üôÉ
---
I just started playing a titan recently and I gots to ask, how tf do you fly around like that for fists of havoc?
---
Here goes /u/sonnekiss again with the demeaning behavior... He just hops from thread to thread insulting people and being a condescending prick.
---
800ish minutes for a kinetic upgrade is a lot of time for people who do not enjoy playing Gambit. They should at least remove that match requirement, it just pushes people towards being half-attentive or afking.
---
Thanks man!
---
I thought it was consul the guy ghual strangled in vanilla campaign but guess not?
---
It's a fun gun. Especially in Gambit, no one expects a second rocket in this Machine Gun meta ha ha. But I just got a new Apex Predator with tracking module and kill clip. :')
---
Though, I think the original skin is much better because it gives off a neon lit cyberpunk aesthetic to the gun. The new one looks a little less interesting.
---
wait is it let's be bad, guys, or let's be "bad guys" help
---
The Masterworks are heavy with these ones....mmm
---
/Yoda
---
At least destiny even has a campaign lol talk shit about the story all you want but at least the campaign exists 
---
I am in the same boat, and I am wondering the same thing. I have a MB that is like 5 velocity away from max, but has every other perk (velocity mw) as the mountaintop, and I might just stick to that.
---
Super decent thing to do Guardian.
---
Playstation?
---
i only occasionally have a lag spike, and I dont think I've ever been kicked from a game excluding ddoses, yet I got a warning today saying I have an unstable connection and I may be suspended and banned from crucible
---
Be sure to drink your ovaltine!
---
I kind of wish that you could say ‚ÄúBring a sword‚Äù as the answer to anything.
---
We‚Äôre going on a camping trip!
---
Bring a sword!
---
A Hive version of this would be perfect
---
Oryx=King
---
Savathun=queen
---
Crota=bishop
---
knights
---
wizards=rooks
---
thralls=pawns
---
You can try, but believe me, I hid that thing well to make sure no one else would get it/
---
Did you give you offering to mara when she comes to the dreaming city? That's how you get the seed from the offering. The other way is to complete a tier 4 blind well or complete the first encounter of the last wish raid.
---
What, am I missing something. I didn‚Äôt know that Mara actually came to the city. Is there any way to trigger this or make this happen?
---
This is why my vault is constantly like 494/500
---
Fucking trueeee
---
I got the breakneck a couple of days after its release. 
---
I almost never use it anymore.
---
Too many mothers
---
Or a third option, *invasion portal is active* the guy with 14 motes invades and we're 10 motes off and no one else has motes. Invader immediately dies to a queen breaker. 
---
or a riskrunner
---
Thank you!!
---
Depending on which one you have it can be soloed or with a team. Generally I recommend with others so you can focus on doing the challenge to make sure it gets done in one go. 
---
Haha , like Jimmy said i was just excited! I don't play crucible at all besides for gear and some loot so yeah plastic tier for the win haha.
---
Agreed!
---
Vanilla destiny 2 was worse than b04, current destiny 2 outshines b04 a long ass way
---
I've been seeing people posting about them recently and resigned myself to suffering for my mistake forever.
---
I still don't know if anyone would care to enlighten me, otherwise I'll just be scrapping every purple I don't think feels right for eternity q_q
---
thanks
---
I was away for christmas and i got trinity ghoul and geomags since coming back on tuesday, which is why i was asking. Because before that i hadn't got any exotics in weeks.
---
First, carefully read the network troubleshooting guide from Bungie and take it all seriously. It might seem like BS but make an effort to really apply the principles discussed there.
---
&amp;gt;[https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Troubleshoot?oid=13604](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Troubleshoot?oid=13604)
---
&amp;amp;#x200B;
---
Next, read their "Optimizing Connections" section. This is where a lot of people have trouble diagnosing problems and just blame it on "the servers".
---
&amp;gt;[https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Troubleshoot?oid=13603](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Troubleshoot?oid=13603)
---
Finally, dig in to Advanced Troubleshooting if necessary.
---
&amp;gt;[https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Troubleshoot?oid=13610](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Troubleshoot?oid=13610)
---
They mentioned a few weeks back that this would only be for the worst of the worst offenders. If you got a warning you're probably getting reported a lot AND actually have poor quality internet.
---
But remember, speed isn't what's most important. Bungie says 1 Mbps up/down is what's required per person playing on your network. That's not a lot! So you're much more likely to be having problems with PACKET LOSS and LATENCY.
---
They also mentioned in the original TWAB thread that these new warnings aren't coming from disconnects. These are specifically about lag.
---
Cheers!
---
It's not a very good implementation. Most people aren't in control of the internet they're provided. Lets ban Drew because the only internet he's provided where he lives is barely good enough. 
---
For those that think "...but if he doesn't have good internet he shouldn't be playing...", lag spikes can happen to ANYONE, regardless of internet. Believing otherwise is just plain stupid. When the day comes that those in agreement with this policy suffer from packet degradation and get banned, I'll be on here, sipping on some Woodford Reserve, laughing at all of the rage comments.  
---
Yes
---
She was the first guardian to ever have 25 killstreak
---
If you do them with fireteams, as long as one person is alive you can re-enter without all the enemies respawning. However, once one person reaches the boss at the end, anyone who dies cannot get back in. 
---
I got the whole CE for 80 bucks. The bag is really nice
---
Kill Clip's damage boost is the same as 3x Rampage Stacks, but only requires one kill to proc. IMO the only benefit rampage has is you can maintain the max damage longer than kill clip if you have enemies to kill rapidly, but Kill Clip is much more consistent for PvP
---
Feels great to get it the first run seeing as I have 35 LW clears and no 1k voices and it took 42 boss kills to get my EP shotty. Feels good finally! 
---
Not sure if I‚Äôm using it right even, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good at all....
---
Thanks, as a hunter main, that's the only armor I tolerate for my titan lol the shoulder pads are too much indeed.
---
I'm with you, buddy.
---
Damn my hunter can't catch a break lol I was using spectral when I took this ;(
---
Yea no. You kinda just put the crosshairs in their general vicinity and it'll do all the work for you.
---
Those matches are goddamn brutally long too.
---
Gold trim means that it's masterwork and will generate orbs randomly while killing and allow you to track your kills...
---
Is there a quest coming out next week that awards the wish ender, if so how do I get the quest?
---
Because R6 fans and CoD fans usually argue with eachother over that. Honestly I‚Äôve never seen a CoD fan shit on Destiny for camping (although I can see it happening for sure) while I see CoD and R6 fans go back and forth arguing over which game is better and the camping point is usually brought up
---
Why the heck is that EP shit harder than Blind well? I hate the timer. This think annoys me. Yes its fun, but you need people. I did only lvl7 two times. This timer is really bad. And the boss is insanely heavy
---
I don't even know how to navigate the goddamn place.
---
But Siege and CoD are so different. Siege id 5v5 tactical across the three gamemodes and CoD is CoD, run around see who can get the most kills or which team gets the most.
---
COD has a lot more to gain from MP vs Crucible.... Even if it most of it are challenges you willingly reset over and over for shinier emblems 
---
Yes I understand that. This isn‚Äôt an argument between the games, this is just speculation on how the fans of the games argue with eachother. If we‚Äôre gonna compare games directly then CoD and Destiny are nothing alike at all and this post is ridiculous, but we‚Äôre talking about the fans and not the games, so it makes sense.
---
He is BOREMAN!
---
I just way too overwhelmed by the enemies. I‚Äôm 585 power and still get killed. I honestly can‚Äôt figure it out
---
Just finished the 25 for the redrix this week. Will never play comp again. 
---
It's also leaves u open to being blocked and preventing your invasion setting up the other side for invasion
---
Hahaha, no problem man, I was just teasing. 
---
oh hell yes
---
of course
---
It's out performed by other hand cannons, but it wrecks Taken enemies. I use it in Gambit  as well as other taken related quests. Even against non-Taken enemies it does well. It takes a bit to proc the DoT effect, but overall it does a good job. Works in PvP, but you'll hardly ever proc the DoT. 
---
Not sure which part you're referring to. The ammo on Whisper goes from 2 to 1 to 0, with 2 in reserve the whole time.
---
Haha that is amazing, I love it. I can relate much better to this video when I play as titan. Thank you! 
---
Just tank the light handicap to as much as you can if over 630 I think and slap on extinguish. Just don't all die and you should be good
---
Shotguns still broke change my mind.
---
Momentum
---
100 light handicap
---
Heavy Weight
---
Any singe
---
Extinguish if you are confident you won't die.
---
This made me laugh out loud
---
Any singe (usually solar), black out, Match game, and extinguish with a 40 light cap. Have someone run borealis for shields and sleeper/whisper/1K for boss damage. That‚Äôs how I run them.
---
Everyone gets the light level increase. You don't need annual pass to get the light level buff.
---
Thats not true before warmind you got more chance to get exotic engram opening the chest first.
---
I haven't found a PvE exotic that I enjoy more than the Dunemarchers. Throw on Impact mods onto all your armor, swap to code of the missile subclasses, find armor that decreases melee cooldown when picking up an orb of light, and pair this with a Masterworks weapon (to generate orbs). 
---
I literally just run around slamming my head into mobs all day. Works well in Gambit as well for clearing areas for your team to move into. If you got an Ikelos SG you can melee + 3 hit medium blockers easy. I believe 4 hit large blockers after melee as well. If there's multiple blockers in the area the Linear Actuator perk on the Dunemarchers kicks in and will do a ton of damage to nearby blockers as well. 
---
Overall they're my favorite exotic armor I've found, only time I swap is for the One Eyed Mask in Crucible or while invading in Gambit.
---
Take out drop mag. Outlaw won't have any effect with it and you will waste ammo.
---
Exactly. 
---
Wish I could get past first boss
---
*cough* purechill420 *cough*
---
People post this acting like it‚Äôs hard to get it to proc dragonfly but I never have an issue getting it to go off
---
This week at Bungie was abridged due to the holidays however they mentioned they are actively looking at it 
---
Shouldn't it be challenging though? If anything I'd like for Blind Well to be harder to complete. The other day me and 2 random guardians completed the Heroic blind well boss in about 10 seconds. No way in hell the 3 of us could do EP in that time. 
---
As for finding people to do EP, best luck I've found is to just start it on your own. People generally join in if they see others doing it, but won't generally start it on their own. Be the one that starts it, If absolutely no one joins in, go to orbit and come back again and try again.
---
I got it twice once on my hunter within 3 days of the release.
---
My warlock had the quest and I passively got it without doing anything special to try to get it yesterday
---
It may be that non Uber grinders are getting it as this is apperently how long it takes to get naturaly
---
I sonetimes do that and still doesn't help. Ep should have matchmaking, so as blindwell (am a solo player and never get people on something, I rely on matchmaking). I dont like the timer cuz usually I just get annoyed for losing all the time because people go away and you cant farm it or something, you just go away
---
I have not really run into a handcanon meta in Gambit.   Pulse rifles scouts rockets and sleeper are WAY more common
---
I put Dragonfly mod on mine! 
---
Epic
---
This is not a bad idea.  I know the hardcore wants cores to stay in infusion but if it drives the mainstream player away it needs to change.   This would also make having the Y2 stuff in collections valueable as currently it‚Äôs not useful 
---
I wouldn't worry too bad about not having Trinity ghoul it doesn't really seem that good to me whenever I use it and the triple arrow perk seems to work against me for the having to get a precision kill to activate the lightning.
---
Just my two cents however.
---
Shots fired my way :(
---
I do this as I‚Äôm trying to increase number of motes deposited for the quest. 
---
It's pretty cool looking and is a solid gun in general but it's by no means the best at anything. I dont really care too much for the meta so I use it from time to time and it's pretty fun.
---
He is not 100% unless if your leveling a 2nd or 3rd and they are really far behind as you can buy the exotic with your 659 character getting the exotic do 630 then giving it to another character it works like the weapons and gives a nice bump in leveling as it‚Äôs a armor slot way above the alt character light level
---
Yep. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve dismantled plenty of god rolls and once I discovered what those were I‚Äôve changed that by not dismantling anything. Now I‚Äôm just a hoarder. 
---
Put queenbreaker with that and you earn yourself a ran out of medals and a ghost.
---
At least that's what it got me. 
---
Find a discord group that will help newbies ,this is a online game eventually so all you need is people willing to help.
---
I enjoy both.. sue me
---
At this point its more my OCD at the fact that im missing two forsaken exotics and all i have gotten for the past month is year ones. Also because that was the forst forsaken exotic i went for and its almost four months out now.
---
In this one sort of do. You get a stim shot to heal. It‚Äôs one of the better updates to cod imo. 
---
Comparing it t older cods I feel you. Back in the day I always chose Halo over Cod... the good ole days
---
Just unlucky, but I do believe you have a better hands of them dropping from Fallen on Nessus. Give that a try, bud.
---
Yeah I feel you I've got all year one exotics for hunter and warlock minus the lunafaction boots and am currently on holidays so I don't know if I will be able to visit xur to get them.
---
Of course, nobody would play it if there was only one map or mode. But what are your really getting out of playing those modes, over and over? A rank up? In D2, you could repeat say, Escalation Protocol, over and over, to get the weapons. Or for the titles or pinnacle weapons. IMO productive repetitiveness is way better than just repetitiveness. 
---
Call of Destiny? I thought the game was called Destined 2 Load........
---
CoD has had 10 years to refine their game style, and the game us still unbalanced. What is it with my sniper not killing people when they are over the crosshair when I shoot?
---
Well, look at it thks way. Next seasom we start getting Xur bounties. Maybe they will be for currently missing Exotics.
---
And this is still the ONLY non raid exotic I don't have
---
True then maybe I can start unlocking some of the great exotics I'm missing out on :P
---
I‚Äôm diggin bo4 a lot. Give heist a try.. it‚Äôs a ton of fun especially, with a squad
---
This! I have a full set of armour from the new raid, with useless perks. I wouldn‚Äôt even care if they slapped a 10 core cost to it. I want to look pretty!
---
I read that like it was from Hey ya by Outkast because I didn't read the sub name
---
This is so beautiful I cant even believe it. 
---
I've got an eye on Anarchy right now
---
 "It's not over! Kill that primeaval!" "Hey guys watch this! -Melts with Anarchy- :D"
---
It does look like alot of fun attaching it to sparrows and whatnot although knowing my luck I'll never get it...
---
Tried turning it off and on again? 
---
PvE do whatever you want. Have a good time.
---
But in PvP it ruins the experience of others.
---
If you're going to do brother vance, make sure to have Sagira Ghost Shell. I really can't think of a better method than that, if you have the shards to spend. Only other one I know of which is slightly better than Brother Vance is the oracle offering but I doubt mainly people can do that now. 
---
But they do! You'll still need to farm the item that has the perk you want. Then you have to grind the mats needed to combine them. By not being able to dismantle all the items as you need them for combining them you'll lack the dismantle parts and cores that those dismantles give. I think we'll even need to grind more.. But at least we'll have some actual progression in those items.
---
Now onto Luna‚Äôs and mountaintop ;)
---
Surely COD is more repetitive. Each year they re-release the same game with a slightly different style.
---
Destiny however has multiple activities with a unique thought process behind each of them. 
---
Basically, anything with armour-piercing rounds, outlaw and kill clip/rampage! Does this roll even exist?!
---
Guardian no 
---
Guardian yes
---
GUARDIAN ALWAYS YES
---
I usually run. -100, Match Game, Grounded and Famine. I mean you only need your multiplier over 4.00% and you should be fine. 
---
Thanks, ill go check it out
---
tried it out a thrid time yesterday
---
spawned, ran around a corner, got one shotted
---
and judging by the memes on the subreddit, it seems like the onyl thing the devs do it change the liked OP weapon from one thing to another, on top of givign NEW players the ability to enter pvp, even encouraging it with the milestone thing ,yet makign the whole meta of pvp about having a weapon that drops from forsaken... thats like being forced to buy the dlc in order to win at pvp... and i dont need to explain why this is really bad
---
They drop from her weekly challenge milestone. They are part of a check off list. The biweekly rare bounties are all rng. But if you keep doing your 2 powerful frames each reset for ada, you will get a piece of armor guaranteed. That's how I got all of mine for my hunter.
---
Best way to retrofit the current ehancement mechanism. Bungie, you hearing this?
---
So the game is unplayable without Forsaken....?
---
So the game is unplayable without Forsaken...?
---
Thats awesome, i got more than 5 weapons with killclip on it,didn‚Äôt know if it was good or not,
---
Pretty much, you can't play gambit unless you own forsaken. Bungie made that clear. Plus you miss out on new end game content too.
---
Does Forsaken have to be purchased via Battle net to qualify for RAF? I plan on picking it up sometime in the next few days in the humble sale as its cheaper than it was on bnet due to subscriber bonus and i have humble credit to reduce the cost further
---
I was getting ready to grind for my breakneck and I had the hazard of the cast with triple tap rampage and I dismantled it
---
I have this exact same thing, coming from Overwatch. I want to get into it &amp; know I could get good but it really takes getting used to.
---
The pace is so incredibly fast, killing someone in under one second feels kind of cheesy (?) and getting killed that way is pretty harsh.
---
To be fair I still have a lot of maps to learn and positioning to get down - so I'll give it time. But it's not the most welcoming game mode the first time you jump in. Shaxx is amazing though. 
---
This was me before I joined and became active in my clan. I used to dismantle everything and never used to use special ammo weapons (snipers, shotguns, fusions rifles) because they just felt really bad. Special weapons I started using a LOT more after playing Destiny 1 for the first time (which was two months ago roughly). I stopped dismantling stuff and started testing out different weapons, even pre-Forsaken, to get a feel for different weapon types. I used to ALWAYS dismantle anything that required a precision kill, as well.
---
Good perks for God rolls: Outlaw, Rampage, Kill Clip, Zen Moment, Explosive Rounds etc... Some perks are better on different gun types. 
---
It will still take 2 years to take a shot
---
Almost like every other damn game.
---
Hehehe
---
i think they're just mad about getting killed by queen breaker
---
i lov telesto
---
It isn‚Äôt le monarque. If you have it that slot will still say unknown and le monarque will just be there. 
---
The unknown exotic is TLW
---
I have done the 40 matches and 150 challenging enemies but I only have 100 of the 500 kills and only 20 multi kills....I don't use auto rifles enough
---

I prefer the default pink tbh.  Idk, it's kinda just grown on me.
---
Ah okay, that makes sense. When I was farming for it last month during the cursed week I thought it was just a random spawn and not for both sides. 
---
Nice, sadly most of mine were dupes but i'm ok with that. I'm close to getting all exotic weapons and don't really want to finish up the collection :(
---
Watching Thralls explode in chain reactions in PvE is always fun. 
---
TLW (the last word) is coming out soon, and it is a quest item
---
Use the app to get squads. I did my first normal  leviathan raid before yesterday and did the prestige yesterday. 
---
I'm not sure, because I have all energy exotics unlocked so no unknown slot but I don't have the monarque. It's weird though because the monarque has void damage so I would assume it's an energy weapon, but I could be wrong.
---
Nighthawk does more damage single target than bb. 
---
Thanks alot and Happy New Year !

1 fucking sleeper Node, ONE!!!
---
200+ resonate stems into it.. I hate this game

The only time I ever saw him put that auto rifle down was after cayde died
---
Light level doesn't matter in d2 unless you're playing iron banner. And there is only one sniper that can one shot to the body but you have to have kill clip proct for that. And the only hand cannons that can 2 tap are 110 archetypes but you need to have a rampage stack or kill clip proct on it for that to happen. You need to land headshot for fast time to kill. Keep at it you'll get the hang of it

check the lore tab on the phoenix protocol to read about some salty titans

Really?  Huh, I didn't know that.  I could have sworn I was getting the same rolls on them.
---
Thanks for the correction, fortunately I have gotten ever piece of armor I don't want except for skullfort so when I get something good I'll hold onto it.
---
yeah I'm currently doint it and its just doing patrols and publiv events to grind for all the keys you need. That's pretty annoying but I also want the items and I'm doing the open 15 nodes quest
---
It‚Äôs only available from Gamestop, if you‚Äôre lucky, you can find it in store
---
I got both the Ghost and the box for Christmas :))
---
Hello, what are you looking for? I‚Äôm part of a small clan, on most nights gmt time zone, with a few Americans in, always help each other out, a sense of humour is a must there‚Äôs a lot of piss taking, mainly pve but a couple of pvp guys apart from playing the game and helping out there‚Äôs no other requirements, 
---
Speaker of the managers
---
Welp, I'm in the UK, no gamestops as far as I know. Amazon here I come 
---
How about Gamestop.com?
---
Then just call it the Sword Logic set
---
Definitely. Getting Luna‚Äòs requires skill. Also you have to be able to hit your crits with Luna‚Äòs or NF. 
---
I wasnt sure if they shipped to the UK. I'll have a gander, thanks man 
---
I got Dredgen and Breakneck without getting a Trust with Outlaw
---
Is glimmer the problem or is it legendary shards and enhancement cores? They are what hold up most people trying to upgrade armor and weapons 
---
No.  It is not a HALF decent score.
---
OH NOOO

It‚Äôs lowlidev 
---

---
Damn you'd think they'd be nice enough to let you deposit at least once. What's wrong with the gaming community these days!!!!!!!
---
Yeah but what about the Drifter when you get an army of one?
---
I have all 40 nodes, all 5 BrayTech weapons, all 4 Ikelos weapons, a fully masterworked Worldline Zero, and a fully masterworked Sleeper. 
---
Not really worth doing, except for Wayfarer, but I‚Äôm still darn proud of it.
---
Oh. Right, OK. I've never been sure, my clan keeps saying I need to get better, they're kicking me from their fireteam for it 
---
A lot of PVP players have been playing for 4 years. It‚Äôs hard getting into a competitive mode when people have that much practice. I message new players when i see them in crucible with encouraging words when they get stomped. Keep at it and it gets better.
---
This is what i was searching for, thx amazing work 
---
its either TLW or izanagi's burden. le monarche isnt in collections untill you get it. it appears in kinetic and pushes the "unknown" weapon down 1 row
---
Definitely good to know before getting some of my chase items.

Regular black holes are about the size of a bullet though

Na nove more broken.
---
Sb is only broken with an exotic the base form is somewhat bad. Not good but not terrible.
---
I loved it. Now it‚Äôs just Luna‚Äôs or NF which sucks because not everyone can get those guns. Lord knows I don‚Äôt have time to grind out Luna‚Äôs, but at least during GL meta I had a gun I could compete with against everyone

not deleted, fragmented :) not trying to be annoying but fragmentation makes his life much more difficult, because he can get tiny slivers of memories but he can‚Äôt grasp them

Halo 2. Burial Mounds. You could ran a player through a wall with a tank. They'd fall, die and their body would be massively projected in the sky just like this. I can't believe I remember that...
---
It‚Äôs now a random drop 
---
It drops randomly now just like every other exotic.
---
I almost want to change the language, just to play gambito.
---
Oh Neil. Ok ty

‚ÄúOkay kids don‚Äôt get too close to the lurker now‚Äù

Yeah that's the sort of thing I was thinking

Damn. Ty

Been my fav gun since day one

A full clan doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre good, often the opposite.

One thing being unfair and broken doesn't justify another.
---
But if you dare to suggest to nerf anything, the destiny community will tear you apart.
---
And as a result, destiny 2 pvp has some of the worst balance of any fps I have ever played, including garbage korean p2w ones.
---
*Io, circa 2500, real footage of balls dropping*
---
I got in from Volundr too.  It has a chance to drop from any forge so long as you're completing a powerful frame.
---
It‚Äôs a shame really because it‚Äôs a quality gun 
---
Shards of galanor are dropped anywhere but if you want the best weapons and content experience I recommend playing raids. 
---
Try the destiny 2 discord for pc lfg 
---
343 doesn‚Äôt have this problem in halo 5. Once a team is down players, leaving only nets you the L, and nothing else.
---
Granted, they‚Äôve got other problems to iron out (to put it lightly), but still!
---
me nervously anticipating to get shield bashed by a phalanx
---
I got all 45 memories and did everything else I Warmind but open all the sleeper nodes because there was no reason too. 
---
No need my friend. You're far too early in the game to be worrying about normal activities like that on your own. Continue doing the campaign, working on a few adventures here and there, and you'll be higher than any of these activities minimum requirements in no time.

Yeah, my friend got it randomly in a crucible match before

The captain is a high value target. When he spawns there will be a message in the lower left corner of the screen that says "a high value target is nearby." 
---
There are sometimes high value targets that are captains in Ancient's Haunt and the Tangle, but not every high value target there is a captain. 
---
thanks heaps :)
---
Are you on PC, PS4, or XB1?
---
Thank you!

*laughs in Shaxx*
---
Max range with them accurized rounds? 
---
Especially funny when you then read the lore text for the Sunshot and you learn that Liu Feng (Who made both of them) WAS a Sunbreaker.
---
I actually heard the opposite, someone in this subreddit told me that you can no longer get them from regular adventures or the Hollowed Lair strike, *only* from heroic adventures. However, I was unable to find any patch notes about this change so I am unable to verify that. 
---
Heroic adventures are only available on the Tangled Shore when it is flashpoint. 
---
Im in the same place, 1.3k , highest solo queue was 1.5k, Im on pc though.
---
Honestly on rocket launchers I fucking love genesis and clusterbomb becaus chances are if I come even close to hitting a shielded enemy, I‚Äôm reloaded
---
I‚Äôd say hunters have the worst exotics overall
---
Sorry PS4

Game tag is U-K-O-G-N-O-S

It‚Äôs chill, it‚Äôs on PC. As long as OP doesn‚Äôt post BNet codes, it‚Äôs fine

Outlaw, rampage, kill clip. Though I do like zen moment
---
*angery Guardian noises*
---
I never read the lore tab for it before now, so thank you for that. It was indeed pretty damn funny.
---
"WON'T YOU JUST LET ME HAVE MY OUTRAGE?"
---
I solo queued 95% of my Luna. The other 5% was helping clan mates in comp to help them get started. Literally took a weekend's worth of playtime.
---
I mean it was last season though so idk how hard comp is now. Then again nothing big has really changed since the week before forsaken
---
LMAO. I never read that. Thats far too hilarious.
---
What's your pl and platform?
---
Just got ophidian aspects a few days back. Reloads are basically instant with outlaw, love em
---
You done responding to yourself? Lol What a joke. Have a blessed day, sir. 
---
So salty.

I just started playing again when I got enough money for forsaken. I‚Äôm 585 so not too low and I‚Äôm on ps4

Almost makes me want to grind for Militia's Birthright...
---
Seeing this with 54 clears and still no 1k voices and makes me feel some type of way. 
---
Farm mind benders and 1 shoot him with it before he can 1 shot you.
---
Or get chaperone and take off his face. 
---
Haha. A true gentleman. 
---
I found him by the little camp in Exodus Black
---
oh no
---
oh yes!
---
I got one of these really early (it's around power lvl 150) and I am sad I cant use it any more
---
 Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold. 
---
I got baron specific loot recently (like within the week) from daily heroic stories (when one of the barons missions pop up in the cycle. 
---
Yeah like Ace. Holy crap that gun has like everything.
---
Hunters have one tree in only 2 of the supers though. Warlocks have 1 in each as well. Comparably Titans are tied for best. 
---
Try kill clip and cluster, it does an insane amount of damage
---
There are some players who say they got it without any weapon frames in their inventory, but not many. It seems that the likelihood is drastically increased if you are forging a powerful weapon frame. Any powerful weapon frame in any forge. 
---
Mind if I ask what your roll on Trust is?
---
It is kinetic.. but shouldn't be occupying a slot until the release..
---
He had spawned and i've finished my damn quest :p
---
There is not according to the armory information. 
---
No one has mentioned raids so that's something I'll say. If you have a friend or two you'll have more ease completing these things but if you don't, raids are still something you should do. They're easily one of the best aspects of the game. Many people quit because they never get to experience this aspect and find nothing else fun to do. Unlike WoW raids the groups are much smaller and you can't solo them so you'll need 6 people but it's very rewarding and has the best and most powerful loot in the game.
---
*nova warp intensifies*
---
Shoulder charge altogether operates the same way on pc as it does on console, but on both platforms its a very solid melee. Not Op due to the risks you have to take to actually pull one off, but still definitely one of the best melees next to handheld supernova.
---
Ah yes, Dead End Cure 2.1, just what I wanted game.
---
Read the one of Phoenix protocol. It‚Äôs by far and away my favorite with this being close second 
---
Thats because those exotics give a large change to how we use our abilities for hunters Celestial it makes us a great boss killer but our super is useless for anything else and orpheus is just for infinite super. Hallowfire doesnt reward you enough holding on to your super
---
BRB gonna go look in my backyard. 
---
What quest? Names of things help.
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs simple math, guardian.‚Äù
---
Its just a quest to find the black armory stuff to unlock the gofannon forge. The quest is on nessus
---
I play sunlock just so I can float and shoot. 
---
Whats up with your hairline? Its like somebody drew it with a ruler
---
 After weeks of dismantling weapons, I FINALLY got the black armory refurbished shader, and man it is saweeet! 
---
If it's an actual quest there should be a marker what specifically does it say to do? Have you tried talking to ADA-1?
---
Thanks for the replies guys 
---
I‚Äôm currently doing random powerful gear quest like strikes,crucible, and heroic events.
---
When my gear is relatively close in level ( some gear is 10 light less then other gear ) I‚Äôll start doing dreaming city stuff.
---
I also wanted to know when I should do spider stuff ?
---
its accurized rounds snapshot sights , explosive payload and range masterwork 
---
:) 
---
I did, nothing. Its a quest, how can I know what to do if its not of the map? It should be
---
Lol ok didn‚Äôt know 
---
If it's in your inventory it will tell you what to do. What specifically does the quest in your inventory say? 
---
There's 2 sides of the coin, the objective best and the subjective best. Objectively, Feeding Frenzy + Rampage is the most versatile and effective roll. While Drop Mag does provide the same reload bonus except all the time, getting any kill to proc Feeding is not a major task or a rarity, in fact if you run your mag dry without getting a kill, you were either in a very niche situation that will likely never happen again, or you are very bad at shooting and need Drop Mag as a crutch. Rampage speaks for itself. The advantage of Feeding is you can have Ricochet, Armor-piercing, extended mag, and Steady Rounds rolled in place of the mag perk. So you get additional perks for range and effectiveness. With Zen Moment, you're forced to use Drop Mag and potentially waste ammo, and lack the additional perks. 
---
Now for the subjective side. If you really can't adjust to Blast's recoil, then sure, Zen isn't the worst. But if that's really the case then maybe you're better off just using Chattering Bone or Bygones, you won't lose much by it and you could get Outlaw Rampage instead. Or maybe you just really like quickdraw or auto-loading holster. Both are objectively bad perks for a Pulse, but go ahead and use it if you don't mind being less effective in combat, making you a lot less useful in raids or forges.
---
Find captains and discover where they got the materials. Guides tell me its a quest
---
My main gripe with Crucible is that it's a team mode but teammates can't rez each other.  Which if you're trying to build teamwork among your guardians seems like it would be pretty key.  I dunno, it's always bugged me.
---
Gotta say was worried this dlc would suck but theres a surprising amount of content and stuff to do 
---
So... No?
---
Not really, at all. 
---
Well,if everybody promise not using there super I think it can be really fun (arc warlock is so powerful against prime evil )
---
Yeah. It's just all time gated which everyone has complained about. 
---
You need a powerful frame of any kind, and I think it drops from the boss not the forge. 
---
Could be
---
If you do decide to, YouTube has a bunch of free audiobooks that people pilfered from Audible. Kill the music and dialogue, turn the SFX down, then fire up an audiobook and go speedrunning. Makes grinding much more entertaining. 
---
This is how I ended up with Wayfarer. 
---
Range masterwork
---
Wolf dot w2 and dusk dot d1 sights
---
Choice between extended mag and flared magwell 
---
Lol showed up for the same HVT for a spider bounty. No wonder there were so many people waiting around for that Captain. That guy needs to spawn more often or put him in a lost sector 
---
Yes. Also scopes modify your aim assist stat when scoped in.
---
I like the fact that you are new and not taking the Level boost. That‚Äôs awesome man and I totally respect that. You on xbox?
---
Wait... why is this here?
---
I see alotta people bitching about the forges but I quite like them and hope they do more with forging in the future
---
my favourite weapon
---
Haha after getting all kind of blue shottys I got my first Dust Rock Blues and immediately dismantled it out of habit. Took about 20 hrs of playtime to get another drop lol
---
Kowabunga it is
---
Yes.
---
People say that didn't happen but they're jelly about that.
---
I was in the excat same situtation yesterday, and i ran nighthawk goldie
---
PROFIT 
---
Not how english works.
---
Because Meyrin Tribute is a forge bounty?
---
I love their name, the Screebs are amazing. Because you can yell it, sound like an insane person, and then a frog looking thing full of pustules explodes and kills someone.
---
Thanks didnt know this existed!
---
Collections are account wide.
---
What‚Äôs the number? I‚Äôve been grinding it since this morning and still nothing. 
---
*Mr.* Perfecter Cell
---
Thanks
---
Our clan had a great granddad who used to take the kiddy winks through raids to help them
---
i can only confirm that D:
---
I never tell anyone, but I‚Äôm 49. Age really doesn‚Äôt matter in gaming, other than our reflexes get a bit slower, easy kills for the young in PvP üòâ
---
In convinced Zavala knows I was farming the nightfall and he knew all I wanted was a helmet and he wasn‚Äôt gonna give me it 
---
Nah. Take a gl death 100 times over a dust rock
---
It really do be like that sometimes
---
That‚Äôs so weird. Pretty much every single full health melee I do is 2 and sometimes 3 hits if they have stacked resilience.
---
As far as ability melees all titan melees 1 kill me when the ability is up (seismic, shoulder charge, etc). 
---
The hunter ones are garbage and barely ever work... who throws knives in a gun fight?
---
If you have the level boost on your hunter, redoing the entire story will get you to 50 no problem, the forsaken story progresses with you level meaning that it has its ways of leveling you up, I suggest doing forsaken side missions and forsaken story line for levels.
---
Better reload, stability, handling, etc. when there‚Äôs like, 3-5 enemies around. It‚Äôs pretty good for PvP
---
Cool story bro.
---
Increased sprint speed and reload when you sprint? It‚Äôs not a massive change in gameplay
---
Suit yourself. I find it easier to outplay a shotgun than a gl
---
My won‚Äôt you use your ornaments and Ghost projections
---
[removed]
---
I got that one yesterday 
---
But canonically guardians don‚Äôt keep their memories of life before being a guardian 
---
Outlaw and rampage would be good as well. Not sure if it in the role pool tho 
---
Imo Sleeper Simulant has the best lore, but I‚Äôm a bit of a futurist nerd 
---
I‚Äôve had a lot of god rolls. FoR gUnS i DoN‚Äôt FuCkInG uSe
---
Just do the story quests to open the dreaming city and public events you will reach level 50 in no time. 
---
Also if you have horror story and or thubderlord transfer the the alt they have no level requirements and buy hunter from xur on your 650 character then transfer it to your alt. 
---
Once you reach level 50 equip the higher light level exotic armor and the thunderlord/horror story then go to collections, armor, go down to leveling tab and reacquire blue armor all your slots lower than the exotic then equip them and repeat reacquiring armor till your light level evens out (prob took 5 minutes for me). 
---
After switching to my alts and doing that method it was less than 24 hours and my alt was already around 600 light. Did this in my warlock first and just barely to my hunter last night.   
---
Karen, the Voice of Dissonance.
---
Any of the below with fireteam medallion active
---
If you're currently at the point in the story where you hunt all the Barons. Taking out all the Barons will do it. Makes it a little easier to manage than just doing story missions.
---
EP, a couple of hours of EP should be able to make it happen. 
---
Otherwise, if you have the shards get a bunch of vanguard reward things (the ones that give you a 5 stack of tokens at the end of strike) I'd actually say this might be the most efficient because you get a lot of experience from doing strikes before lvl 50 AND you get more XP when you get vanguard rewards from zavala.
---
Not sure if this is accurate or actually a thing, but I seem to get XP faster when using exotics that easily produce orbs of light or supers that produce orbs of light in fact. If you do EP and happen to have gotten Orpheus rigs from xur recently then you can make oceans of orbs of light. After an hour or so of EP I usually leave with a couple bright engrams.
---
Right but I am looking to save time. I know it will get me there but I dont mind doing something more boring to get it done faster.
---
There was one called "Disassembly required" and the quote was something like 
---
"Step one: aim
---
Step two: disassemble enemy" 
---
Run those Luna‚Äôs until they waste away. Don‚Äôt listen to the whisper users that look down on you for it. 
---
Yeah nighthawk has more single target damage than blade barrage. 
---
Ignore this heathen. I pray to his Lord and Savior RNGesus daily and he has seen fit to bless me with 6 exotics in one week. Be vigilant in your prayers, do not stray from the faith, and when RNGesus sees fit to bless you with 1kV then, and only then, will he do so.
---
Has any of the original awoken become guardians or all awoken half light half darkness ?
---
It‚Äôs not that good
---
I can guarantee ophidians makes outlaw reload faster, try it rn.
---
No problem m8
---
Snapshot, I mostly play crucible and am at a point where if a gun has bad handling and comes without the perk I just shard it, being able to play fast and reactively is a big thing in the current sandbox.
---
It‚Äôs just a bunch of ghosts and sparrows. 
---
This made me cry a little. Both tears of joy for ya but also tears anguish!
---
"i want to re make my level 650 hunter.. *into a male model"*
---
Idk. The modeling industry is really harsh. It could be really hard on the Hunters self-esteem, and I wasn't aware that Ford was looking for Hunters.. I mean I could be wrong but I'd think this through before committing your Hunter to a career that it isn't suited for. It might just be happy continuing to be a Hunter.
---
Same, got it las Thursday 
---
That‚Äôs it, really.
---
All the collections is account wide and once it‚Äôs found, it‚Äôs always in there.
---
That gun eats my dude! Have Fun!
---
This happens on this specific boss this week, the acolytes that spawn with him will drop a toooon of orbs
---
Care to elaborate on this glitch?
---
Lunafaction boots would like to know your location.
---
I bet she sent the whole thing back
---
Ikelos sniper does too and uses energy ammo
---
I just got them this morning. I‚Äôve never had so much fun ballistic slamming people
---
I fuck those things up every time I see them. No mercy. Fuck those gusy.
---
OH! Is that how it works? Idk some of the lore. Thanks for the info, gonna look in to the Evos some more. Fascinating world building sometimes. 
---
Mine doesn't move without either. 
---
Level 15 Lucky poor 
---
The 6 guards at the very start to leviathan are a popular place to farm "powerful enemy" kills
---
Uldren died when he got shot in the head. This new Risen is someone else entirely. No memories of hia former life. He gets nadda.
---
Spider sells glimmer if your that desperate
---
Being killed makes you not the same person? Then why would he even have a chance at hunter vanguard? 
---
I‚Äôm pressing ‚Äúf‚Äù on the worlds smallest keyboard. 
---
That‚Äôs the roll I settled into
---
Are they? I just run Phoenix on everything these days.
---
You get super energy from capturing a point too
---
it was a new drop
---
What? Oo
---
In the Marasenna, Mara Sov basically examines a Guardian named Savin who has no memory of his time as an Awoken in the reef, or his family, or anything. He's different from the person he originally died as. Uldren has no claim to the dare or the vanguard because he died as Uldren. Whoever he is now, isn't Uldren anymore.
---
Yes you can get outlaw in column 3 and rampage column 4, feeding frenzy is just a better version of outlaw as any kills regardless of a headshot or not make the reload faster
---
Maybe you're missing out on a lot of the lore discussion right now then. 
---
And?
---
Oh cool, thanks! 
---
No actually, I'm really into it. Seems like you're not understanding what happens when a Ghost revives someone.  
---
3 times is nothing man. I ran the forge 86 times before I got my first drop. Now that was before the protection but still. It's rng man.
---
Nah man I am on PC. Sorry!
---
I do have Forsaken, but have chosen to play the game through properly. Don't see the point in just rushing to the end and not experiencing all the content!
---
 I do have Forsaken, but have chosen to play the game through properly. Don't see the point in just rushing to the end and not experiencing all the content! 
---
I know what happens. They are a blank slate. No memory. Nothing. However, a major lore discussion right now is whether or not Uldren should be vanguard. If Uldren is the vanguard, I am stating he deserves right the the Ace of Spades by the same logic.
---
Wait shit, was going to reply to your comment about doing level 6 over and over again, but that‚Äôs what I did, still haven‚Äôt gotten any of the guns
---
Yeah i always feel like it says something about the other team when im alone and just trying to get some motes dunked for my powerful bounty etc and they still invade and go full sweat. Like dude chill, youre gonna win dont worry.
---
True! You can also pick up some fun exotics - Graviton Lance is the best of those, imo.
---
Lol
---
It's an MMO. Solo play is fine, but it's better with teammates. That's kinda the point of it. 
---
Yeah and it‚Äôs an awesome gun but I‚Äôd still choose midnight coup, nation of beasts, kindled orchid, blast furnace, and go figure over it for my primary slot.
---
That's what I am saying. Uldren killed Cayde-6, Uldren wins the dare. We or Petra kill Uldren. Uldren is dead. Dare doesn't apply. Ghost revives this new Risen. Dare still doesn't apply because Uldren died and is no longer in the equation. 
---
Yeah it's still available. Are you looking the correct boss? It opens up a portal on a ledge
---
God I hope they see this.
