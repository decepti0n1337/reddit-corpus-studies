SUROS invites you to take the high ground.

mountaintop fits the clip better but you see a lot more jotunns in the crucible

yeah the issue is i think that would let luna be too close to NF in capability and NF really should be significantly stronger than lunas, but i do agree with not having drop mag. Also i would be down to lose mag howl and zen moment if im being honest, both hot garbage perks now

Deadass if they do a crucible pinnacle auto I will shit my pants
---
It's a pretty specific one, and likely not an easy one to fix. They made the boss hit two phases at the same time and the game makes both phases happen at once because of it. You're only options (that I can see) are to prematurely make him immune for a period of time while a phase begins to stop players from melting him too fast, or to add a new clause that renders the previous phase disabled as soon as the criteria for the next one is met
---
So I haven't played destiny in like a year and was planning on playing again when the new update drops....s...should I not get it?? All i see is posts on how terrible it will be for new players lol
---
Mind writing up the rolls, dont know the icons by heart lol
---
I really like how the Braytech Winter Wolf looks. I wish we had a gun that shared the model but with year 2 rolls.
---
Striker annoys me, since it heals and gves back super on each kill, especially since they've removed these effects from other supers/exotics. I could deal with either one of those, but not both. Maybe split the two effects between the two Fist of Havoc trees?  
---

---
Recluse is less annoying. Still annoying, but not gamebreakingly so for me.
---
He looks like the emperor of mankind
---
Hello there!
---
Time to blow 2000 crucible tokens on getting a godroll
---
In D2Y1, all the subclass trees were that color.
---
There's so many differences between the two you dipshit.
---
tbh, it doesn‚Äôt actually effect anything in regards to gear. They do it to maintain ‚Äútradition‚Äù but change the uniforms every chance they get.
---
Iron banner is what crucible SHOULD be. I swear to the light, if I get killed by another flipping LL 69 Hunter............
---
Fire rate and damage increase when more people in the fire team use it I think
---
Yeah calus shaders do that, it doesn't look remotely as good in-game
---
Stop, this makes me feel things...
---
(But please, do continue )
---
Honestly this is the main reason I'm good I have to work that day, bc I'll get off 2 hours after launch, just enough time to get the servers up.
---
Already been practising my t-bags to ensure they will be able to enjoy the proper Crucible experience LUL

Wh.... why did you add sunglasses? We have a sunglasses ghost shell. (otherwise top notch!)
---
Downvoted for a positive comment. That downvote brought to you by Blue's Only Gang.
---
Played against amateur bots I see
---
It's either what Natedog said or it's because I think it might've gotten a buff a while back. Not sure tbh.
---
Every time I see these: *confused screaming*
---
Still one of the better auto rifles in Crucible.
---
As a Titan yes, the striker is hilariously bad. OEM, On the other hand, is not that bad. I don't even use it because it's not even the best Titan exotic.
---
Most effective tactic available. There are some weapons that, if you can get hits, will kill faster. Mostly based on damage per shot and rpm. The people at r/CruciblePlaybook really get into this. There are some from quests, others are just good rolls of specific guns.
---
Dying is okay as long as you're not repeating mistakes, usually running off by yourself. Practicing in quickplay will reduce hate mail as it's not ranked.

Did you buy destiny two or the forsaken pack? I hope the forsaken pack because it has everything and is 40 bucks

Sooooo. Good talk.... lol

Looks like a shadow price model. Best looking guns out there

Definitely. See you on the Moon.
---

---
You won‚Äôt need to buy the base game if you wait for shadow-keep.  But it is up to you.
---
I havent played in forever, but I remember when a skin like this went live (I think) before the first expansion and I hoarded em, are they obtainable again or still a limited time item?
---
Just eliminate all fusion rifles from matchmaking and it‚Äôll be fine...
---
Fusion Rifles LOOKING AT YOU JOTUNN are the bane of my existence in PVP
---
Yea, and when your on the ground it does hand signals. Also, some sparrows can roll/flip if you hold brake and spin while in the air.
---
Honestly don‚Äôt even know what that‚Äôs for either LOL
---
Me too
---
Yes because I took high school biology.
---
I'm hoping to apply the same logic to my outfit once I've beaten the Shadowkeep story, but I'm having trouble finding the right shaders for each piece.  On my Guardian (a Hunter), I'd like the Io helmet, the Liar's Handshake, the Chest and Legs of Optimacy, and the Solstice cloak with the Arc glow.  I've got my eye on one of the Dreaming City shaders for the cloak (Blueshift Dreams), and I'd like the rest of the outfit to conform to the general blue-black-gold color scheme, but I'm not sure where to go from there.

I hate the bottom-tree titan. He should not last that long. I'm a titan. In fact, I've never had any other character since D1. I hate how long that thing lasts. Honestly, I'm starting to dislike any roaming super. Dawn Blade and Arc Staff are not equally annoying, but pretty damn close.

did you do sweetcircle as a joke?

Recluse doesn‚Äôt require forsaken, you‚Äôll be able to obtain the gun once you‚Äôve hit the rank.

It‚Äôs baaaaaaaaack

OeM isn‚Äôt even that op it‚Äôs just annoying hearing people complain about something that‚Äôs easily avoidable. It tracks but you can still hide/run, unless you just stand in one spot waiting to die it‚Äôs not hard to avoid.

Tbh this. I give it a good 60% chance that it won't even be used by most meta sweatbois

And that is why we have ~~fireteams~~ an incoming nerf on roaming supers

You can't get low level drops if you have high power.
---
From the start of Shadowkeep all gear will be upgraded to 750, and New Light/new players will start immediately at 750. You will be fine to level up at the same rate as your friend and experience everything together =)

Not really. As it, just the weapon. For r/destinyfashon you need either the set of armor you combined or  the weapon AND the set of armor. The armor is mandatory.

Found Iron Banner to be very enjoyable. I am playing it a lot to train my PvP-skills (which need training).

Well he is wrong, to play forsaken you need to have purchased forsaken. As for why it is not on steam, battlenet is currently the launcher for destiny 2, that will change October first with the launch of shadowkeep, at which time I would imagine forsaken will be available for purchase on steam. A little reading, google searching, forum browsing goes a long way.

 I am not talking about kill counts. Talking about basic understanding of what to do, dont know what to do? Follow others. Thats where a lot of fails. Simple logic.

I‚Äôve just gotten two on my friends back into d2 but it‚Äôs gonna be a while before they‚Äôre pvp ready tbh. Sadly my glory will be reset by then and I‚Äôm back to square one. My social anxiety keeps me away from lfg, unfortunately for me.

---
I have completed hundreds of forges and have never had a piece of Black Armory armor drop randomly.  I've only had them from using the Polymers, from completed Ada's weekly challenge, and I believe from her rare bounties.  Now, I have not been doing them recently, and I'm also not trying to imply that you're incorrect.  I'm just stating that it hasn't happened for me in hundreds of completions.  I have full sets for all three classes.

Who said anything about Year 1? Forsaken was the same. As was the Black Armory and the Season of the Drifter. This new model wasn't something they started till Opulence when they split from Activision. 
---
Also the game isn't F2P. Yeah, they made the base game free, but that's because Destiny had hit it's ceiling for people who would buy in, so they were making no money off of it. You still have paid expansions and paid seasons that have less content than ever because they are pumping ridiculous amounts of resources into Eververse.
---
I get the armour like every 2 forges
---
‚ÄúOMNIGUL! Silence her screams!‚Äù

Some of the blues are beasty! My partner helped me to fabled in comp maining a blue sub machine gun. But I do like the look of that one. That shader is one of my favourite.

Idk, dawg, Shadowkeep is making it look like Activision was never the problem.
---
  
---
We never had stupid fucking Battle Passes when Activision was in charge. They never deleted content *we fucking paid for* when Activision was in charge.
---
That creepy, Ana with stache looks better, and not as creepy as Petra version.

I wonder if that is a recent change.  That's not from completing 2 powerful frames, correct?  I haven't done them in weeks.

Dude, they went from 90/120 people working on a game to 30/40. How can you expect them to make more. Reusing old assets has sometimes proved beneficial. Just look at Fallout:New Vegas

Go to the Tower pick up all available quests and get started.

I believe you will (Not sure when) have osiris and warmind.
---
TLDR; I made a mashup trailer for Destiny based off one of my favourite Borderlands trailers! 
---
I'm a huge fan of both Borderlands and Destiny - the words 'looter' and 'shooter' do unholy things to me. I also love making fan trailers and motion graphics stuff so I figured why not see what a Borderlands trailer would like like if it was actually Destiny... I took the ["The Borderlands Are Yours" trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIBf1GqAw5U) and recreated it using footage from Destiny trailers to bring the Destiny universe a little bit of excitement and mayhem.
---
The footage and tone translate surprisingly well, although I did have to dissect a fair few trailers from both Destiny 1 and Destiny 2 to get enough varied footage. The last thing I wanted was it to look like i've just slapped a Shadowkeep trailer underneath audio and motion graphics from the Borderlands trailer, so I ripped apart about 5 or 6 different trailers in the end!
---
The process started with cutting together clips from these trailers with the audio track from the Borderlands trailer - my aim was to find and use clips that matched the BL3 trailer as closely as possible. After all the footage was in place I took it into Adobe After Effects and painstakingly recreated all the motion graphics segments so that they fit the Destiny universe. Finished up with a bit of sound design here and there and voila! 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
*p.s. I don't know about you guys, but I'm insanely happy that Shadowkeep got delayed. It sucks that we have a few more weeks to wait but it means I get to actually give Borderlands a good go before my life inevitably falls down the Hellmouth.*
---
If you have a decent light level, you can play the first three raids that comes with actual game. Also, I think bunch of other stuff is becoming free on October 1st like gambit and more. If you get bored by raids after a while, wait till October 1st.
---
Destiny 2 has a large community. If you wanted to raid, then just send a post on LFG sites or the official Destiny 2 companion app or somewhere on the internet and you will find your team.
---
Hope I have been helpful.
---
If you complete 2 powerful frames in the same week, the reward will be a random piece of armor.  The Polymers do not grant powerful armor, but are good for farming better rolls.
---
I know the tread is 3d old but  now I finished all the quest steps you get from the event. I have now all armor sets and all weapons. In the process I got 6 gauntlets and 4 boots. Also a few weapons multiple times. But i had to finish the quest steps to get headgear and bodyarmor.
---
This will be the next crucible pinnacle. Quote me on that.
---
Sparrow horns
---
Makes sense, guess I haven‚Äôt seen it consistently enough to know :P
---
:(
---
Blades has very little super-armor as well. Had a fully masterwork set of armor and i was still getting killed just as easy as in GG.
---
Id...  I'd totally play a destiny themed BR tho. I have no shame in that.
---
I think that we should pressure them more... 
---
I hate when everybody is throwing Bungie's mistakes on someone else. Just stop it, we deserve better game and without pressuring them it won't work.
---

You're so insensitive, Zavala was cursed by the Deathsinger to have hair loss!

---
In D1 Warlocks were OP and D2 Titans are OP
---
Oh, is Rumble a joke to you?! /s
---
Its very entertaining to see a group of enemies get hit with a tether or nova bomb so hard, they disappear and reappear and float into the sunset.
---
That's biased lie, sorry
---
Well if I were you, I'd just wait for the next expansion - Shadowkeep. It's coming out on October 1st and it's gonna change how a lot of the things in the game work (especially armor - look up Armor 2.0).
---
The one time I've been able to beat a bubble was to drop a well right on top of it and start firing. For some reason the warlock and titan inside came out and each got blown to pieces by bottomless sunshot.
---
I‚Äôm only surrounded by fear, and dead men
---
The Black Armory armor? Crown of Sorrow armor? Menagerie armor? Reckoning armor? All of those require season access.
---
I feel like there's a fat joke in there... Somewhere.
---
Anything rank based eg resets/fabled are seasonal. Next season you'll have to start the rank aspect again.
---
I prefer synthocep bubble
---
Wrong they didnt leak the raid armor the vex invasion armor was leaked and that's the reskin
---
 
---
Can‚Äôt wait to kill her again
---
Same
---
Bruhhhh
---
It will stay on whatever step you're currently on when the next season starts but you have to finish the quest in the same season you reached fabled... that's the last step
---
That's literally the first time I've seen that used in D2 crucible with out it getting immediately wrecked by another super. Kudos for getting that done.
---
I love punching shotgunners and supers to death in that thing
---
They're also making your collected items NOT cost bright dust to reacquire.
---
Do your ever verse bounties, buy your items and settle down. Missing a cosmetic or two isn't exactly gamebreaking.
---
Good job buddy. Keep up the good work.
---
I can already hear it... the Reeeees... MAKE THEM STOP!!!!
---
YOU MAKE SAINT 14 AND I PROUD GUARDIAN
---
Honestly, anything's better than a fricking copy and paste game where you're just "fighting" to get a cosmetic. Tbh, I hope Bungie doesn't take all this bullshit to heart, because I know they are great the way they are; and it's not like they should, because all communities are like this, none can just be happy with what they get.
---
Speaking about armor, what the hell is all this glowing stuff that everyone seems to have. Am I still going to be able to get that when I start in November?
---
I'm not the biggest ward of dawn fan, but I used to main Titan so I know not to mess with it (I'm now a warlock, but I do have level 50 on each character)
---
Don't worry, I did the same thing with the purple sword crucible emblem..  lol
---
honestly, wouldn‚Äôt mind reskinned King‚Äôs Fall armor.
---
All that Gibraltar play in Apex is finally paying off

I'm already prepared as my Sunday best includes the helmet of an astronaut.

I don't even care about recycled content because I didn't really get to experience much of it the first time

Meanwhile if I use it every warlock and hunter instant spam blade barrage and chaos reach
---
No it was a i think two week event.
---
I started playing 3 weeks ago and just saw my first bubble last Friday
---
Oh Halo my childhood right there dude
---
That's the Solstice armor. You could get it during the last month, it's not obtainable anymore. Also, those glows were available in eververse for 5k dust. It can be used only on the Solstice armor and makes it just look cooler, nothing else.
---
\*Shaxx sounds intensify\*
---
But I die. Each time. Because they're not helping. I'm only 584 or something right now.
---
Use Crimson, it worked for many people.
---
How can they farm for materials if we fail the mission every time because I can't do it myself?
---
Dude the best thing is bubbling the primeval
---
Just run top tree Sentinel. Holding your action skill button is gonna place a bubble. Helm of Saint-14 enhances the bubble.
---
I get that But I still want to have the black armory look in year 3, it's one of the best armors IMO and  I think they should make that a possibility.
---
If you can avoid it, don't go into the bubble. Else you need a super to shut down the bubble.
---
To play Shadowkeep or Forsaken content, you must own it on the platform(s) you wish to play on.
---
Hope that answers your question!
---
I did this and had a warlock use Dawn blade at me, then a team mate and I punched him to death. Was dope, missed doing Titan things.
---
No it hasn't. You wonder why?
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
You get the materials in the end of this at that bot which gives you things you forgot on the field (I have forgotten it's name) but I think the game launches you back to the forge after it's over and that's how it works.
---
Yea your powerlevel is the issue here, and thats why u get matchmade with afk‚Äôers.
---
Been running Lumina the last few days, it's extremely fun to use.
---
Yea, the gear you earned won't be obsolete if you have good rolls. And, you can go back and play Black Armory activities and earn 2.0 versions of that armor.
---
You can look it up on youtube for farther info, it is good for the hall of tribute
---
It becomes a suicide mission with heavy at that point. That, or blade barrage or nova bomb. Or even thundercrash
---
I just want them to bite the bullet and pull in old raid armor if they are out of ideas
---
You will need to get your light level up, it's matching you with people who are farming and are closer to your light level. Even when you loose you are rewarded a small amount of planetary materials, so people put low level armour on and leave their characters in there. Reach 620 and you should hopefully be fine.
---
I‚Äôm still an above average player. But I‚Äôve gotten very reckless. Especially when I play striker. I don‚Äôt even think even when I charge head first into a group of enemies because I know there is basically nothing they can do to stop me. With masterworked armor giving me even more damage resistance in super, healing after every kill, and duration extending after every kill, I don‚Äôt know how the super made it into the game in the first place. It‚Äôs so crazy broken. 
---
I‚Äôm practically going to have to re teach myself how to use supers when this update hits because I won‚Äôt (or at least I shouldn‚Äôt) be able to 1v4 anymore with one. Not that this is a bad thing. It will just be a pretty big change.
---
What do you mean option? Grinding power level isn‚Äôt the only thing to do in the game. Right now I‚Äôm just grinding for weapons that I want and playing PvP
---
Pretty sure you get it from placing all the tributes. I think there's a triumph you have to claim for getting all 50. Also, this must be done legit, so if you cheesed the tribute hall, you have to go back and earn them the correct way.
---
Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.
---
People stay sleeping on the Cerberus+1 too. In a zone control mode where assaulting points is key, I'm creating sons and daughters out here with that gun.
---
Are you in a clan that has perk 5 unlocked?
---
Playing strikes with clanmates increase the droprate
---
Why does this footage look so smooth?
---
I‚Äôm waiting until there‚Äôs no hand holding in competitive to get everything.
---
I agree and have also made stupid choices like that cuz of the same reason...and at this point it isnt that im using it to abuse it...im using it cuz you cant play like a normal human beign without it...its just crazy
---
Alright, I understand now. Thanks.
---
You‚Äôre way too low light.
---
Both, you will have all 3 once the addiction kicks in. Then when you want to change it up or a new exotic comes out that you want to play around with, you just switch.
---
I don‚Äôt need speed I need resilience
---
Got it. Well ok, thanks.
---
I'm pretty sure it does?
---
Hopefully you are picking up some of the other gambit pinnacle quests as well? Two birds with one stone and all that. I was getting 1-2% medals per game, so you've got a good way to go
---
Lol wtf
---
From my 0 to recluse experience:  
---
If you lose a game, stop playing. Don‚Äôt use lfg because the people there are worse than you. Stay positive! Meta weapons and supers are good to use but not essential (I finished off the grind using bottom tree nightstalker with the new hunter exotic).
---
Have fun.
---
It would really good but I don‚Äôt think it would be op
---
&gt;At this point it would almost be like a World of Warcraft 2, how would that even work, way to much to leave behind.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but they kinda did that from D1 to D2, right?
---
IMHO they may be working on D3 but why announcing it at this moment? It would make everyone lose interest in Shadowkeep... like why waste money in something that will be replaced?
---
Absolutely. I that‚Äôs what the community mangers are there for when we give them feedback. 
---
Unfortunately for us, even with that feedback, the heads at Bungie have decided that Eververse Loot &gt; Game Loot. It‚Äôs discouraging to say the least.
---
Why do we deserve anything? I mean, if we pressure them more than we are already (with about 90% of posts on Destiny related social media being ‚Äú&gt;thing&lt; is bad‚Äù) it might have the opposite effect, and the content will be worse because the devs will rush things to get them out faster to please like 25% of people with not reskinned armour.
---
And if p2p means pay to play... I mean, dlc‚Äôs?
---
Thank you! Will save this
---
She‚Äôs actually the next one I‚Äôm attempting!
---
Striker Titan with Dunemarchers.
---
Unfortunately the unflinching is uber buns. But yeh, take what you can get for sure
---
Nice any tips for staring out if I do get it? Sounds fun!
---
That would also make the food past the expiration date.
---
I would rather prefer that the first three ‚Äúlevel ups‚Äù for the week‚Äôs bright engrams not be accelerated, but rather the first three drop random ever verse armor from that season as powerful gear. Three more chances to grind out some more powerful armor, and you can earn it no matter what activity you do.
---
I just want to flip my warlock to female so I mirror the Vanguard. By pure coincidence I made my warlock human, hunter Exo and titan Awoken, but they're all male so that's the one thing that's off.

i‚Äôm excited for this mainly because i like having the more ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù or modern look on my hunter (i.e. dead end cure or the EDZ set, parts of the prodigal armor, etc.) so the fact that these armor sets will have the 2.0 system adds a whole new level of diversity, including past raid armor and eververse ornaments
---
No no. I‚Äôm saying they could keep eververse armor sets, like alllllllll the armor sets she‚Äôs carried since D1 launch, but with year 2 perks and they can drop as powerful ‚Äúbright‚Äù engrams for your first three level ups that week (no boost to how fast you level up on the first three anymore, also). You bring them back to the tower and she decrypts them the same way rahool does and they‚Äôre guaranteed to drop at least on random piece of eververse-exclusive armor from all of year one and two at a higher light level than what you got. 
---
Same way powerful engrams drop in the wild or are earned from activities.
---
That shit is fucking hot no robo homo
---
It happens all the time, especially if you play on a higher sensitivity and drag scope. I even had a time yesterday that it even happened on a [collateral.](https://xboxclips.com/PrintTugboat448/253e9fe2-f11d-4b72-910f-5103ee4c8ded)

*Guardian Down*
---
With 3 stacks of roaring flames burning maul is the highest damage super in the game.
---
Hallelujah
---
Man forget my titan. Just a dummy thicc skull that holds nothing in it.
---
Ummm that's not the last step. I just got it last night and you kinda need to reset your valor 5 times in a season
---
Am aware. Still requires more setup. Would rather it just get buffed
---
It‚Äôs not sabotage when he was the best player on the map. Fucking crybabies
---
As Hunters do.
---
I just realized, is that a *lever-action* shotgun? Cause that‚Äôs pretty slick.
---
Pump-action takes the cake for intimidation, but lever-action has unmatched swag and style.
---
Tack on a boop from tractor cannon and itll be ghorn 2.0
---
Lol. My bad. I didn't realize they were getting nerfed too.
---
... I'm talking about the Mountaintop objectives.
---
Not at all usually if you run max mobility you shotgun ape, but if you have high resilience high recovery in crucible you play more of an aggressive anchor in comp
---
Thats for redrix, hes talking about mountaintop, and 5 resets in a season isnt that hard, currently have 11 resets during this season, also had 11 resets last season
---
Honestly been super fun to fight against, reminds me of d1. Lotta folks dont know how to counter it though lol.
---
Lol I like the quick thinking to hop on top
---
Just regular bounties work!
---
You just do the regular bounties e.g kill scorn in the tangled shore
---
Quadruple OOF! Something similar to that happened   to me in IB the other day it was......frustrating to say the least.
---
Regular bounties
---
We need to be able to customize our characters faces. I hate that they are locked
---
Found him guys also it is, he's being a dick for no reason how would you like it if I did that to you?
---
Welcome to destiny servers!
---
Lol can I join?
---
The game's had recycled content since the start of Destiny 1. Why are you only complaining now? 
---
As long as the game doesn't go pay2win, (which it hasn't so far) I'm sticking with it for the gunplay and general fun.
---
People use spectral?
---
Cayde-6 still looks the best.
---
Name is a placeholder
---
Another great thing sharded , bungie destroys everything fun.
---
You will win many kudos by knowing how to turn the events Heroic, there are plenty of articles and you tube videos on the subject. I will also add that at the start don't really bother looking for the "best" meta weapons, try them all and simply use the one that YOU like the one that YOU feel like you get the best results from.
---
Do not get discouraged if whilst playing The Crucible (pvp) you lose and lose often, in time you will learn the mechanics and positioning as well as all the nuances. Patience is your best friend in this game. 
---
Welcome aboard Guardian, we really are a helpful bunch so don't hesitate to keep asking questions, the more players that have fun in this awesome world of Destiny the better it is for all of us.
---
Eyes Up.
---
Did you not read my last comment? The only reason why people are mad is because the only armor set that isn't completely new is the raid armor. Also stop with this "be grateful" BS. If I'm going to be paying $35 for something I want basic expectations to be met.
---
I'm not trying to be snarky, I'm asking honestly. Is this an ability Warlocks have? Is it network lag? I hit this guy by my count at least twice, maybe three times, and he took no damage at all.
---
It comes when you finish foresaken on the hunter
---
Seems like a fair bit of lag, from what I can tell.
---
Thank you! Really hipes me up for next month, will do!
---
The most difficult matchup of all time, how bad did it get?
---
Let people enjoying themselves with their own loadout please. Would you rather see a clip of an invasion with a hammerhead or Truth ?
---
Daily grooming is for the vain. I fear no lady-faced man.
---
I don't think they can nerf or buff specific platforms with how this game works. Especially with cross save now.
---
Why does every hair option have to make me look like an anime lesbian?
---
What does that have to do with the game t it‚Äôs the only real choice a titan has? You‚Äôre a fucking OP hunter. Omg you‚Äôre such a lil bitch.
---
A man can dream
---
I agree with that. Hive are mythic creatures, born on the Fundament when the Universe was young. Gaining so much power after they made a pact with the Worm Gods, they too became capable of becoming a god, as did the 3 sisters. So killing Oryx for good and ‚Äúkilling‚Äù Savathun in D2 (but not in his throne world, so not an actual kill), the guardian did slay gods.
---
The Eliksni, is just another species on par with humanity. Nothing god-like to them.
---
(Scorn being zombie Fallen are out of the question as well.)
---
No god for Cabal either.
---
Although, the Vex still have some gods. The Black Heart is the ultimate God. Well, basically the Sol Progeny (the 3 Vex bosses guarding the Heart) are what you kill directly to kill the Heart, but still.
---
Besides that, Vex have their Axis Minds, which are sort of demigods. And there are many of them (the majority being Hydras or Minotaurs). Some are just gate keepers, so not actual gods, but others, like Theosyion, Panoptes, The Undying Mind, The Templar, Argos or Protheon, are proper gods.
---
TL;DR, Hive and Vex have gods.
---
Oh cool. Thx
---
Ah, I kept getting this when I was trying to reply to comments. Wasn‚Äôt sure why had to unlock the farm.... again
---
I main Warlock dumbass and who the hell shat in your breakfast this morning? Jesus
---
For $35 you‚Äôre getting a Rise of Iron sized expansion with a raid, multiple NEW exotics, new weapons, armor 2.0, a new season with possibly new pinnacle weapons, and your basic expectation is how the raid armor looks? Gtfoh lol. Your ‚ÄúThe only reason people are mad at Bungie is the raid armor isn‚Äôt completely new‚Äù is pretty lame.
---
Cayde is just cursed...
---
Oh. Ok.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure everyone is.
---
This reminds me of this one video of a guy slapping Everyone in his way
---
And people shouldn‚Äôt be rightfully pissed at a studio trying to make money breaking from a huge publisher like activision, but that‚Äôs just my opinion. They don‚Äôt have the man power to make ALL of their fans ‚Äúexpectations‚Äù immediately after this split.
---
Well you don‚Äôt have to. Only if you want to play forsaken content. Lol
---
how? you saw me i just banked AND got a badge with it
---
Yeah I don't get their reasoning for that weapon being a crucible pinnacle weapon when it's used almost exclusively in PvE from what I've seen.
---
#S A N I C 
---
#M O D E
---
Seriously, though, if you plan your movements right, you can be very difficult to hit. However, you're also *very* fragile, so stay out of melee range (unless you have a sword).
---
But that's thing reload speed with some of the perks/abilities is already fast enough unless the reload speed is going to be essentially instantaneous this seems redundant.
---
Stardew valley. Took almost an hour. Why the hell is it so slow?
---
hahaha I just got SUPER lucky. I got it in gambit prime so maybe just keep banking 15 mote blockers
---
Wow... I'm very envious. I've been stuck at 39/40 for about 10 months
---
Cayde looks good witha beard
---
I used this site, super helpful to me.

someone make more spongebob destiny memes

Acd/o feedback and bubble are great too for clutch moments
---
Lag.  He's lagging or you were.  I play on crap internet so it happens to me all the time.
---
I hadn‚Äôt thought that far ahead lmao.
---
That sounds really fun, I might have to give it a twirl
---
I got my we ran out of medals on a warlock, I use transverses, shotgun hand cannon and top tree stormtrance with arc bolt. Or get away artist instead of trans steps
---
Ooooh ok i got it now XD
---
They need bad luck protection across the board for activity specific exotics. If a certain amount of completions is reached, say 20, the the following completion should guarantee it. Especially for raids. I‚Äôve seen that people have done the maximum amount of possible completions to date for Last Wish and STILL haven‚Äôt gotten 1k Voices yet. I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs absurd but I don‚Äôt even think that word is good enough.
---
Both for the same reason:  People are pathetic and make it not worth it.

Fr. Whenever they introduce new archetypes they always end up super OP. This thing will probably 2 or 3 shot kill in crucible.

It‚Äôs pretty trash with one two tbh. The handling is gawd awful so you don‚Äôt get enough time to get the second punch off. Definitely the best pvp shotgun imo though.
---
I thought it said kid. Lol
---
I think kill clip/explosive is ideal, but then again, idk what moving target does actually, so...
---
The warlock arc subclass is really good for close combat when surrounded by tons of enemies because it chains. You just shoot the lighting and you‚Äôre guaranteed to kill multiple targets at once.
---
The best part of a reset.
---
The items you can buy for dust are getting rotated.
---
Literally a big banner popped up in game stating all in game purchases would be useless as of today.
---
Gotcha, thanks!
---
This must be a PC thing because this rarely ever happens on console
---
Yeah and the middle tree is amazing dps...it‚Äôs just so difficult to choose a main
---
I‚Äôd probably get a bunch of ghost pins if I had a reliable group to trade with
---
Asher is definitely going to steal your kids in the middle of the night. Damn that pedostache
