Nice! I'm looking into cleaning up the setup my wife and I have. How big are the screens and where did you get the stand?

do the forges from ada and get radiant frames each week

Better than my dad, he would just bust into the garage every few hours, yell something like "What are you nerds doing" then slam the door and disappear again.  We only had 2 lan party's at my house, THANKS DAD!

Already have the bang bus so I might as well have this one too

Where did you find that couch?

As a pizza delivery driver back in the day myself that is awesome. I know your ovens were hot, and you guys were having the cut table superspeed. Biggest order we ever took in my time was something like 200+(500?) pizzas which took us a full hour nonstop both ovens to make, and completely filled the bed and cab of a big Pickup Truck.
---
Glad you guys got a good tip and that Bungie thought enough to give you guys copies! Great story!

Alright alright alright!

it's a joke cause I started playing in november :)

I do well in Gambit against players though :)

Trinity Ghoul is a lot fun to use. Especially the Lightning Rod perk after getting precision kills. Perfect for multi-kills. 
---
We're going to blow up the Nessus Parliament, duh.
---
Correct.   You do get a free seed though (not linked to drop chance), so you can prioritize blade barrage. 
---
I think OP means its enjoyable to melee, even though our melee is shit. As a hunter main I love to melee but it usually ends up with a titan smashing me in the face.
---
My first time raiding in D1 (vog) two of the members were father and son and although we had to carry the son it was one of the best times I've ever had.
---
As a hunter I always lose when melee a Titan.
---
What entertainment stand/thing is that?
---
I like the teamplay and actual battles, not twitch shock surprise death. Deaths just happen too fast, even when it's not me; I don't consider fast deaths with players fun. I like the challenge, jumping around, strategizing, team play, etc.
---
Yup, that's what I like.
---
I'm with you
---
Not only do you but the to talk, it has a voice to text option that mutes voice comms and translates into text.  It mostly makes sense.

Everyone saying it's about the 1v1 is stupid. because OEM just has to get TAPPED by a bullet and next thing you know ur marked and the OEM can see through walls. ie can flank ur ass and just end up killing with you some a shotgun then proceeds to get an overshield and damage boost
---
The exotic catalyst grind. You have been warned
---
Sleep well, fellow Guardian!
---
I‚Äôm a OEM user and abuser. I think it needs a nerf. 
---
My wife and I have a similar setup. We have monitors and ps4 but with desks.
---
You ignored the 1v1 part. The mark doesn‚Äôt matter if you kill them. I agree it is annoying if you hit them and run away because they know where you are. Also it tells you when you are marked, run to your teammates. There‚Äôs plenty of ways to counter it. t‚Äôs just strategy, which most people would rather complain about something then find a work-around. I shit on OEMs all the time.
---
I use it as well, a lot of the times I don‚Äôt. I disagree with you I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs as broken as people say.
---
I actually just finished my 4th match I tried it out again because of the replies I‚Äôve gotten, and I have to say reddit was totally right! Much more enjoyable than I was imagining, I‚Äôm really liking it actually
---
My son is only (almost) 3. It may or may not be destiny, but this will be something I do in the future. 
---
It can be rare to have something in common with your dad. Enjoy every minute, OP.
---
I would criticize, but I know absolutely nothing about art
---
This picture good, very like.
---
Yeah you're going to see forsaken exotics, but don't be fooled. These don't exist, you can't get them. But you're gonna get all the y1 dupes that you already have. Also edge transit. 
---
That's why you shouldn't watch Call of Duty youtubers who play Destiny imo. 
---
Spider will give you the quest to unlock the first forge. Once you have completed it, you can get the quest for the second forge as a random drop from killing fallen anywhere. After that, the quest for the third forge drops from vex. The fourth forge is open as soon as you unlock the first one. The first three forges have enemies ranging from 610 to 625, but the fourth forge has all 650 enemies. 
---
Be sure to read the forge quest steps very carefully! Also, hover over things to get descriptions. The most common questions I see are things like "where do ballistics logs come from," and when you hover over Ada-1's bounties you will see two that give those. Another is where to forge weapon frames. When you hover over forges, it will say what frames can be forged there. 
---
Thanks Dad!

Taken King was a huge change to D1, no doubt about it, but Rise of Iron/Age of Triumph is my favourite content.

It happens as you go an only need for one class you dont have to have exotics for every class i only run hunter yes it slows my forging down but it also meads im not going oh wait im on hunter bamn dead

Hunters rule because it's taking from OVERALL where there are more Console players then PC players, we that complain about OEM and titans are from PC, HUNTERS RULE IN CONSOLE

Lol I didn‚Äôt camp at all. I just played Quickplay normally and completed. Sounds like u might just fucking suck bro
---
I wish that‚Äôs what my dad will do with me
---
I get that. I couldn‚Äôt care less if they change it for PvP. They can nerf it into the ground for all I care. Its just that if that nerf affects the PvE side, then I have a huge issue. 
---
Last Word is definitely a PVP oriented weapon. It‚Äôs always been that way
---
Anthem is even more shit tho 
---
Send what my friend?
---
Thank you 
---
People are confused because patch notes implies a detailed list of changes. Most people saw he mentioned that OEM will be addressed. Funny meme though!
---
Yes in the Destiny 2 subreddit I was asking about Destiny 2
---
Well at least it was more enjoyable than warmind
---
Well it would suck even more for the teammates if nobody filled when people left the games. And if matchmaking didn't suck to begin with, filling for the leavers would bring the match back to a fairly balanced state. Of course that's a big if.
---
Any of the Mars weapons due to the balance and amount of  time spent there, also Halfdan and forgone conclusion are honorable mentions 
---
(Exotic is rat king though say what you want üòÇ)
---
I‚Äôm just saying the bridge between someone that‚Äôs good and someone who is good with the OEM is a huge jump. I think they should just change how long someone is marked for vengeance.

This is a rather *Vexing* conundrum.
---
I was definitely thinking broadsword like quest 
---
I can see your point. But at the current state there is a learning curve imo this idea that a horrible player with OEM = A god, it‚Äôs just not true. If you can‚Äôt even get a kill for one you aren‚Äôt benefitting from OEM, plus even if they get the buffs there‚Äôs no saying they will get more. Only place OEM is dangerous is on somebody who knows what they are doing in PvP which is why I think it should just be tweaked very minutely.
---
Skiff: Hello there!
---
I think you just get shit in when you go in the crucible so you want to blame exotics instead of your skills. It‚Äôs okay I sympathize for your kind.
---
you can get items now, then, when your light is higher, pull from collection and infuse into what you have. also lock the armor you get from him because they have unique rolls, unlike collection version
---
Worst part for me is the constant DRB  Luna's OEM spam I see ducking everywhere. I've been stuck in an elo deficit for days. I can't get out of Brave 
---
Still your point there remains defenseless.

I'm not sure the correlation your drawing with the advancement of technology and price?

Solar, brawler, knife trick with ophidia spathe; doesnt get any better than that
---
Still bugged. Went on my Titan, got the Stolen Black a Armory Gear. It says ‚ÄòPursuits Full‚Äô when I have 27/50 pursuits
---
I wanna say I've seen it in the hangar somewhere, but I may be wrong.
---
Does it impress 90% of the populous here? No. It doesn‚Äôt. 
---
But does it cause any harm to anyone giving someone a friendly ‚ÄòGG‚Äô for their achievement? Also no. 
---
For some people, hitting 650 on all 3 is a big achievement. No need to be a dick about it
---
The buff is fairly situational in terms of its utility, since it only procs on reload, and only after headshot final blows. As far as damage buffs go (ROF buff in this case, but whatever), you're more likely to get frequent usage out of Kill Clip or Rampage, which, bang for buck, produce similar results.
---
Also, it's been outclassed in neutral by Blast Furnace, which has incredible range and is rock-solid on recoil control.
---
Thats the problem for those people who don‚Äôt like crucible or struggle in it, it would be near impossible to get it and not to mention it is really op if the other person isn‚Äôt using a meta weapon. This is the same for lunas howl, not forgotten etc. Destiny as a game forgets some people have a life and makes quest that are too long or too hard for certain people. 
---
There is also the fact of it being a legendary weapon with its own intrinsic perk, (technically intrinsic because its unique and nobody else has it) its, yes a hard weapon to acquire but, no it should either not have that perk or make it have a lesser perk and just make it exotic. 
---
To be honest crucible pinnacle weapons are a really touchy and arguable topic. So if some of the stuff i mentioned isnt right just tell me but thats mostly what i think is the majority of opinions.
---
Does your son already play destiny? If he does then either way one of you would lose all of your work you'd put in. So you might as well just get the game for your Xbox so that it's cheaper.
---
If he doesn't play already, there's no guarantee that he'll like it enough to justify paying for another PlayStation, it would make more sense to just buy the Xbox game as you're wasting less money potentially.
---
Tldr: you should buy the Xbox one game because it'll end up being way cheaper.
---
I heard it was supposed to be with her, but so far it hasn't been. Is there something that has to occur prior to receiving these gifts? Thanks for info. 
---
I don't know to be honest. I did complete it and the emblem shows in my collection badge. 
---
But, before completing it, it did not show as hidden or missing in that badge.
---
Have you actually finished the forsaken quest by speaking with the vanguard members in the tower.
---
Same. It hurts.
---
I dont really think there is that misconception. My gripe with the video is you did it at 650. Theres a significant difference between a player at 650 and one at 610. A 650 honestly doesnt even need to care about what perks their armor has which made a solid 2 minute intro chunk unnecessary. Apart from that it's really as basic as that parent comment for completing Volundr. I'd understand for maybe the other forges because of the added mechanics like shanks and servitors in Gofannon and the platforms and turrets in Izanagi but this one is as basic as it gets.
---
How do you get the masterwork I haven‚Äôt even used the gun since release
---
Sweet bussines feels awesome when fired too. It still sucks.
---
Didn‚Äôt they say they were just lowering the max speed of skating  (in pc due to macros and stuff) but ultimately keeping it because it is associated with the titan‚Äôs identity?
---
All that grind for a weapon who isnt that good... i think i played this thing about 1 hour and then i tooked it in the vault
---
On PC yeah, but not on consoles.
---
Idk, they were pretty vague about it but we can only hope
---
Don't even need the best to be effective. It gives you wall hacks so getting the drop on a group is super easy then added on the speed you attack with once you close in
---
That‚Äôs soooo cool how much did it all cost to the nearest hundred??
---
Ace. No doubt.
---
Better devils cause I used to be addicted to OW and its the closest thing to mccree for me
---
Even just lowering the speed would be a great improvement 
---

In the UK , so ¬£700 for the TVs, ¬£200 for the cabinet and ¬£300 for the sofa. Plus two xboxes that I already had.
---
Tried Rahool does nothing :(   
---
Also had a drop from completing the Osiris campaign and it didn't count either :( 
---
this feels like a miniature..... i can't quite place it but ... I dunno
---
yeah dude if you open that Isochronal Engram the 97 shard on a character that has all the year 1 stuff you are guaranteed year 1 exotics you dont have. so if its only warcliff you are golden
---
As mainly a PVE player, I super glad I suffered the grind to get it. It outclasses every pulse by a mile in PVE as it‚Äôs super easy to keep desperado active. Already put 2k kills on the tracker with it. My load out of Redrix / Jotunn / Hammerhead is great for just about anything. 
---
In Crucible, you really need to adjust your play style to its strengths. Stay back and try to proc desperado when there is a group of people. It‚Äôs not a one on one type of weapon but can wipe a team quickly if used correctly. Was able to do this twice so far with it. 
---
I LOVE CRIMSON. Used it in crucible for like all of season 3. I would love if it could get a little love to make it have a slightly more competitive ttk. I still use it in gambit and pve activities all the time though. 
---
I‚Äôve been using Go Figure with headseeker and moving target. Really enjoy the four round burst for PvE and the Crucible! Kinda like an offbrand Vigilance Wing 
---
That's a good question. It's a long shot but maybe queensfoil? Lol
---
1300h still missing heart of inmost light and geomags
---
I prefer the crimson on hunter since the lack of Health Regen (other than Wormhusk Crown) is a glaring issue in my playstyle.
---
On console ace and pc last word
---
If you know what you‚Äôre doing malfeasance is a mean motherfucker in crucible.
---
Same with the "my luck this week" posts

You forgot reload on precision.

---
Nice pancho.
---
ah, didn't know that. thanks :3
---
Congrats! I got mine a couple days ago too. Super stressful, especially during invades drying to get the team while. Finally did it myself and I was shouting! Now I‚Äôm back to really enjoying Gambit. It‚Äôs actually pretty fun if you don‚Äôt have anything riding on it and can sit back and enjoy the gameplay. Btw the Malf is an awesome hand cannon. My fav so far. It‚Äôs so soft shooting and hits majors like a truck after you stack your shots. Enjoy!
---
10x stack; could've just thrown a rock at him and killed him.
---
I legit thought this was a bakugon because it didint loaf the gif and I didint see it was on r/destiny2
---
I mostly used Trust and Malfeasance. I'm at the "Get Mythic in Competitive" part of Luna's Howl and I'm pretty sure I'm never gonna get there. I started over, went from PC to XB1 to play with my friends. I've been hitting up Xur every week. What do I get from this weekend but the world's most obsolete exotic hand-cannon. 
---
10x eh? Really winning against all odds, weren't you, buddy?
---
I was thinking what if they‚Äôd finished the storyline and everything for the Season of the Drifter??? 
---
I think they‚Äôre celebrating because something in that season is really really big and they‚Äôd just managed to finish it in time. I HOPE IT‚ÄôS SRL
---
Also had the meatball spawn again yesterday. Also super fun if you don‚Äôt have the entire quest riding on it and you can enjoy that fight too. Killing it is so satisfying because of the mechanics that prevent an insta-wipe. Feels good. 
---
Noice
---
Now for the 200+ hour grind on Mars for EPs and Nodes for that CoO and WM collection badge! :D
---
Phalanx shows up: "Hold my beer."
---
I haven‚Äôt gotten one yet but I‚Äôm farming forges right now so maybe I‚Äôll get one
---
everyone feels under powerer lol
---
They all require some grinding
---
It's just better in PvE, super unforgiving in PvP.
---
Ugh this boss is BS. Even if you kill him the adds still spawn and if they kill your team, you wipe and start the boss fight again, this time without your super and heavy ammo you just used.
---
I was gonna say I remember putting in like 3k hours of D1 and having 10 exotics to my name, people don‚Äôt know the true struggles of RNG.
---
Not my intention. But do bare in mind I did like 70+ Bergusias. 
---
Why not pick up both seeds of light? Really easy to get them both.
---
Is joke
---
But Malfeasance kinda sucks despite how cool it is.
---
Uh..... I thought you made the video.... I'm always ok mobile too. I hardly ever use my laptop or 2 Apple computers I'm still working on getting together.
---
But it doesn‚Äôt fire them both at the exact same time.
---
HoIL is a better Hallowfire Heart if you know what you are doing, Wormgod caress is good for memeing, Anteus Wards are really good if you can learn them, but they are really hard to get good with.
---
West of Sunfall was my go-to HC for most content until Ace. I never really fell in love with Crimson or Sunshot, but then again even Ace and TLW went in the bank because, well, Telesto exists and I can only carry one exotic.
---
Haha, I'm the same way with attention span. This was one of those things that I just couldn't stop until it was done!
---
I also politely disagree with that statement
---
If that's your playtime from the last ten days, yeah, it's good!
---
However, the glaring problem is that your Titan only has 4 **minutes** of playtime.
---
That's unacceptable, lol. 
---
Same. I‚Äôm sure guardians around me are like ‚Äúuuuugh‚Äù, but watching things melt in a solar explosion is fun. 
---
Grats, I got it on Weds, a good week for Wayfarers! 
---
The overshield and instant health replenish are ludicrous. Every other class has to disengage gunfights, while OEMs can just mindlessly push forward and survive team shooting.
---
The problem is not the 1v1, it's that after winning one you become unkillable for the next one.
---
Also that dumb mark lasts a stupid long time and you get it for free. Make it so titans have to shoot back to activate it and it'll be a lot more fair.
---
I get that. The only thing that I've been able to complete recently was getting my Hunter to 650
---
i have around 1500 hours and still dont have all the exotics, you lucky bastard
---
For real. I‚Äôve been farming blind well all week just glad I‚Äôm done with that crap lmao.
---
5ooo hrs on D1, not wasted. 
---
It lasts a whole week?
---
That's fine, do you play on console? I see everyone praising 180 handcannons left and right but on PC they feel like crap, at least to me.
---
Ah but I like Blind Well! Probably wouldn't if I'd been doing it all week though. What was the final thing you were needing for title? 
---
Welcom to the Ascendent Relm 
---
I knew I should‚Äôve gotten the app sooner ;/

I think it would at least one shot a guardian not in its super, been a while, hard to remember. Biggest thing was the skill tree layout, could run some nasty builds with the wombo combo variations. Tether delay was still there though, for sure

When Calus says grow fat from strength but titans are already thicc bois. 
---
Warlock is my favorite Character but I wish they were stronger in PvP (that might be an unpopular opinion but it feels like the others have a decided advantage right now) but I just created a Hunter with Spectral blades and it‚Äôs been much better in the Crucible
---
Like the one on nessus that you can't reach because it's twenty meters above your head. The little ghost icon pops up Avery time I sparrow under it. Wasted 40 minutes trying to get it.

Careful you‚Äôll get downvoted to oblivion for suggesting that hunters have better exotics. I‚Äôve found this sub is mostly hunter mains bitching about how OP OEM is and how they are so underpowered in comparison

I love Spectral Blades but Arc Staff And Golden Gun are Aries for me I think. They both dominated the other void Supers for Hunter that‚Äôs for sure. I like Arc Staffs potential for multi-kills but Golden Gun has the range. 
---
Wow that tether totally caught them off guard. They were probably like "Us versus one guy, easy clap". Can't say it hasn't happened to me before though. Nice play! 
---
Killed by the architects
---
It really all depends on what I‚Äôm doing lol I‚Äôm mostly a pve player and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm mostly commonly running, but if I decide to jump into pvp it can change quite drastically. Besides my prodigal vest - I need to look fabulous
---
No, I'm on ps4. Input a counterbalance mod on it 
---
Probably impossible to solo at that level, hard to solo even at max level. Get the Destiny 2 Companion app for your phone and find some people to do it with.
---
Hunters lose gunfights anyway even without the overshield active. How do you think a Titan activates the perk in the first place?  By losing the gunfight. 
---
A talon is a birds claw 
---
Look on this sub and see the numerous posts whining about titans. 
---
Guys calm down, the question isn't should I or shouldn't I go for 15 motes, it's only about thinking 1 seconde, if someone as 14 motes for a reason or another, and you only have few, just let him go to 15.
---
The risk is higher if you don't let him, because you know what ? He will probably go to the next zone to get this 15th mote and then die by the invader
---
That's fair. Warlocks definitely are gonna need some sort of update to help em out in pvp, but I love their versatility in pve with offensive and defensive supers
---
You've done more to earn the new cannon than most. GJ!
---
I'm guessing the knives on his back are from a blade barrage. Waiting for the explosion. 
---
I literally use underpowered/off-meta items in every game to make this point. 
---
Warlocks can do it too. It's all about dem angles!
---
This happened to me in the same spot!!! 
---
Reported for skating enjoy ur ban
---
Tbh im gonna miss oem. It actually gave titans an enjoyable experience in the crucible. 
---
I love you man 
---
Titans run salt mines 
---
it's a conspiracy
---
Right? I use it everywhere unless people cry in raids and force me to go well of radiance. Then I just go lunafaction boots and become an endless shooting machine. But I can add clear like no tomorrow.
---
I see more spectral blades than blade barrage lately.
---
sword = insta-destroy
---
Crimson need a damage buff to match up with the other hand cannons
---
And so does sunshot
---
Hunters should boycott crucible (in universe lol).
---
True
---
and 7 enhancement cores :D
---
Here you go m8 if ur over the age of 18 ur good to go @ https://www.bungie.net/en/ClanV2?groupid=3712395
---
we are a growing clan and such but we are PVE-FOCUSED
---
also please do join the discord and such 
---
You what m8?
---
Can you on me as well?
---
Oh
---
Can I get a pm too?
---
Put salt tastes gud
---
Happy to help! Nice roll btw
---
Look back in my previous posts, I for one have things to do with my life other than argue with some stubborn individual who isn‚Äôt capable of figuring out work-arounds to something. Life is full of challenges bud, you have to learn and adapt. If you aren‚Äôt able to do that there‚Äôs no helping you. I assume your a grown man, I can‚Äôt hold your hand. As I said before have a good day, I need to get back to life üëç
---
Malfeasance is definitely not better than crimson. Crimson wrecks in pvp.
---
Good luck. Keep it professional, not personal, and you'll be able to keep the high ground. 
---
Titans aswell, having a shitty jump, well not allowing you to survive other supers, but you can't exclude nova warp, they're definitely also complaining about that
---
Very active clan - all platforms https://www.bulletheads.org/
---
&gt;alive 
---
Ehhhhhhhh
---
whats a good roll for a sword on major clearing? Is it the one where you get ammo after consecutive sword hits also with surrounded?
---
Can you send me to the team that helped you? I‚Äôm stuck at brave 2 and 3
---
Sorry about Nova Warp getting stomped on, but Chaos Reach with Geomags is still top tier! Pair that with a Melting point and it makes for one dead Primeval
---
In it's own right its the least difficult - for the PVP focused players Unbroken is nothing - doesn't even require the collection badge. Its legit just 4200 Glory in 3 seasons.  
---
Chronicler requires the lore from Malfeasance, Ace Of Spades, and from Wish Ender breaking all 40 eggs, 16 Ahamkara bones - which requires some of Last Wish etc. 
---
Hey fair enough. 
---
I never expected this much of a response!! feels so good! :D
---
You‚Äôre such a dick!!!!
---
I'm glad we could come to understand each others views 
---
I just need this and osprey. But got damn I can‚Äôt get the osprey nor a braytech schematic to drop
---
So the third light seed raid exclusive again?
---
My friends and I call this "the particle accelerator" as its a glitch (this is our theory) that when you hit a object just right, you go like in between the object and the game freaks out and flings you.
---
Titan skating is setting a macro so whenever you jump it presses it quickly. Warlocks can do it if you set it up right
---
I got the curated bow yesterday. I would have liked to keep the collection in my vault. But I wanted this shader. Insta-destroyed 
---
Rivensbane isn't really impressive - Petra's Run is only difficult because of Guitar errors and the RNG on the Ship, Shell, and Sparrow is ridiculous. Cursebreaker is more difficult as it wants a 6 week commitment getting all 40 eggs and 16 Ahakmara bones, Blacksmith isn't even that tough - Chronicler requires the most effort but 14 weeks remain to even finish it off
---
Ive been trying for 3 months man, I got up to 600 glory and lost it all, then just back and forth, Im about to just give up, I cant do it. The higher i went up the easier it seemed to get, I would get competent team mates, then its like bungie said F this guy and started handing me level 6 team mates or 2v4's or just randomly getting disconnected during a game or the endless 4 stacks against a team of solos, my clan wont help they are pve IDK what to do but give up. Like I would genuinely take any tangible advice I can get because what im doing isn't working. 
---
Quit playing D1 after I hit Mars... looking back now, I regret it... I only dat that because I had no idea what you were taking about and when I googled it i thought "I want it back too"... the ships are... rather lame to some extent
---
Destiny is a game that brings people together. That‚Äôs one of the reasons why I love this game so much. Interacting with the community is always so much fun, and people are almost always really ready and eager to help. Especially now that Bungie isn‚Äôt part of Activision anymore, I can‚Äôt wait to see where this game takes us next.
---
If you‚Äôre getting killed by shoulder charge then you‚Äôd just as easily get bodied by a shotgun. Shoulder charge is only good against unaware players. If you watch your radar and play with any kind of awareness they should be free kills. Try only shoulder charging in Rumble and see where you end up on the score board. 
---
As a hunter, I can agree 
---
Also fuck Titans 
---
I played only d2 from launch and never stopped. I only recently found this info and it killed me that I didn't know this but it's supposedly one braytech schematic per 24 hrs or something like that. I've had way more schematic drops using this method, still no sidearm fml, all duplicates. 
---
Not is a normal sense. If they're spaced out enough you should have enough time to kill one at least.
---
But most side arms require a clip or two to kill most people and by then that other guy already showed up.
---
titan skating needs a nerf
---
More like, fastest titan that ever lived. Not fastest titan alive.
---
It probably cost more to make than the price of the annual pass too.
---
They made crucible steps for polar lance. Why make pvp steps for a pve weapon that isn't even good?
---
FRANKY VEX DOCKING!
---
Hence the imho :)
---
To me, completing a Petra‚Äôs run is very impressive. I don‚Äôt have a regular raid team so the thought of a team being competent enough to nail the raid with no deaths (guitar issue aside) is amazing to me.
---
Much appreciate... i have at least one more friend who wants to do the raid aswell... but gardens and the running part is pretty difficult with two people, if not impossible 
---
This is what happens when you launch Destiny 2 after updating drivers...
---
Absolutely! I got into destiny when the second game came out, and have loved it since. I recently got back into playing it when Forsaken came out, and chilling with my friends and doing strikes and crucible really makes it enjoyable. 
---
I can get some people to help if you want, my wifi is down tho, so i prob wont be playing till like friday
---
Happen sometimes yes 
---
Sunshot procs playing with fire on thousand cuts, it's still pretty usable 
---
&gt; I‚Äôve put in hundreds of hours and I‚Äôve only had 10 exotics? Is that all? 
---
Started Dec 17th and i'm at.. 114 total, i think?
---
It's RNG and it also depends on how efficient you actually play.
---
We started playing as a group in mid-december and while some of us are at 110+ out of 116 exotics, others are at 90, while some are even lower than 60.
---
"Hours played" vs "exotics found" is a pretty pointless metric in general, because that's assuming everyone finishes every single possible source for them (like raids, throne and such), which simply isn't the case.
---
well thanks, ill work on it next time 
---
In this case the helmet will not stay on RIP OEM!
---
Hmm...guess I need to do the first step on my warlock then and hope I get lucky 
---
Standby for Titanfall.
---
Where the fuck can I get Gwysin Vest or is it just a random drop? 
---
Modern problems require modern solutions
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills
---
I‚Äôve been wondering the same thing about the piece of paper next to the Drifter. 
---
Xtreme light boarding bro
---
I love that glitch, except when I‚Äôm just tryin to climb. 
---
I thought it was a great montage! Just hoping to offer up constructive criticism is all. Keep up the good work.
---
Given that bungie has stated easily 20+ times in the last few weeks that they work on things for D2, are still looking for new ways D2 could go and such, the whole "D3" meme could really tone down by now.
---
Do keep in mind they are not bound by contract to even work on D3 in the first place anymore.
---
no one knows how to scan it yet because the death barrier is too high
---
Pretty sure it's radeon wattman just screwing me over
---
woah
---
Thank you !
---
my point is that it offers a huge advantage. not that hard to understand buddy.
---
Beautiful. I love the look of this gun. Reminds of the Chiappa Charging Rhino. 
---
top tree golden gun for Solar hunter because IM ROOTIN TOOTIN READY FOR SHOOTIN
---
Watch out for dem scratchy boiis.
---
The whole design itself does bear some resemblance to Vigilance Wing. Can't remember the skin name even though I've been using it forever. Book of the Dead or something? 
---
Try other weapons dude like that sniper called chaperone 
---
don‚Äôt play it then 
---
I love Daybreak and its recent buff has made me so happy. I'm a happy little vegemite 
---
i've already made some meme montages in the past such as this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnxTAUPohL8&amp;t=84s don't know if that is what you mean by "funny", anyway thanks for all your feed back, i'll try improve on some of these points in the future. btw how long did this take to write?.
---
I think everything is balanced. Even as much as I hate to say it OeM. 
---
That's it.
---
thanks for the sub ;)
---
everyone else seems to says otherwise 
---
How do you make these? 
---
 *Ballyhoo* Mk.27
---
Damage increase on all of them. more damage means more kill potential, or is that not how people die? I could have sworn taking damage caused you to die but my copy of the game may completely backwards and damage is actually supposed to heal you.
---
It's not like the balls are touching 
---
Not easy
---
Dear God, the whoosh-ometer reading is off the charts!
---
What‚Äôs the deal with that gun? I‚Äôve dismantled like 80 so far
---
Stop classifying an entire class to be the same
---
And dead
---
Been there before bllluuuuurrrrr
---
\&gt; imagine having to touch the enemy to kill them
---
What?
---
Imagine being a nightstalker and thinking you're a space cowboy
---
This comment was made by the gunslinger gang
---
Upvoted so fucking hard.
---
THIS. I never got to experience either TLW or The Chaperone in D1 since I'm garbage at PvP (and yes I know that they're PvP weapons). Even when running the meta I get less than 0.5 kad per game. I wouldn't care if I had to do a 650 nightfall just to skip the PvP steps for those quests
---
Who hurt you
---
And then the game would lose a massive chunk of players and have even less content. 
---
Are you dumb? Read it again, maybe this time with an adult
---
And for one brief moment he flew close to the sun
---
Don't know why you're getting downvoted. This is exactly what happens. 
---
Light speed is getting nerfed
---
You can easily wipe a team with all of their supers active 
---
I'm Mario now.
---
Also we can get up from below the ledge.
