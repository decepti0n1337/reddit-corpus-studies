There is no reason to wait for Forsaken. Forsaken is not available for purchase on Steam right now regardless, so if you want to play it now you can, and you will not have to rebuy it on Steam, it will transfer over
---
---
---
Ok
---
ASD, ESL, or JDA?
---
Yeah, because the players of new light guardians wouldn't be able to handle how destroyed they are.
---
No I know it‚Äôs not free but when I try to purchase it it says I have it installed?
---
Ah, I see.

---
Thank you for the quick reply!

outstanding move

I skipped most of the last two seasons and just came back this week. Over 100 Mayhem matches and a bunch of new quests later I do not regret my choice. Definitely check it out again.

It is indeed part of the wishender quest
---
Ok thx
---
We don't know yet. I would imagine so, because they don't want to have barriers stopping people from playing together.
---
goddammit
---
Yeah if there‚Äôs any character to know from D1 it‚Äôs Oryx haha
---

All we know is the sneak peeks shown in the livestream, which is pretty much nothing.

That‚Äôs totally me when i see a horse

One day, I will get a mclaren, make it cayde blue, and have the license plate be cayde-6.

Honestly the icons really say it all.

Dead orbit bois
---
Look on the Bungie website, there is a place to sign up for email updates with that information.
---
Considering you‚Äôre the only one that seems to be speaking this ‚Äútruth‚Äù it seems to be an isolated issue. What sort of NAT type do you have? Is there any additional traffic or known barriers your ISP may have? I assume your gaming setup is the absolute cutting edge best, so I‚Äôd look there. Clearly Bungie themselves seem to be having pretty good stability ignoring the Blizzard snaffu yesterday.
---
It means a horse
---
If your mindset is to support the negative then I seriously hope you seek help in the future.
---
The final invitation of the nine
---
The Vex sent Cayde-7 back in time, thats why we havent seen him
---
I might be the only one having issues. However, others might be having issues and not reporting it. It may not be an isolated issue.
---
I definitely don't have cutting edge tech but all my connection tests show a very solid connection.
---
Regardless, running heroic story missions over and over and not getting credit sucks.
---
RIP Cayde, RIP Factions

It's the symbol of the nine and was used for the trials flawless emblem.

Who's the "tender" son?
---
Yea. Shadow keep is an entire expansion pack like forsaken. Its $35 and listed on steam
---
Actually just edited my comment. Ends up there are a couple error codes going out. Your crazy anger is the problem that people have. It‚Äôs understandable but isn‚Äôt the first time an online game has blips.
---
Sounds to me like your setup is trash. I bet you have comcast. But then again you might counter say you have fiber optics connected to your modem. Sounds lile you need to move on. I have no issues with destiny at all and i just returned to the game not even a few weeks ago.
---
It's kinda a fun game, except for its many issues.
---
There, is that better?

I think it's at the beginning of the cutscene where he gets the coin with the pyramid ship on it

Indeed it does my guy!

I saw that too

I want that as well

If another redditor gives you a gold, then you get premium for a week and 100 coins which is how much a silver costs. Or you can buy reddit premium

I'm gonna put on the ol' point emote just to see if he still points back.

Actually the faq makes it more confusing especially since I did read it and your saying they aren't.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; The game is becoming free to play in September, and this will encompass all of the year 1 content. What you must buy is Forsaken, the Annual Pass, and/or Shadowkeep. Forsaken includes the year 1 DLC, however this doesn't matter because this is now free for everyone anyways. The Annual Pass is explained above and is the rest of the year 2 content, and then Shadowkeep will begin year 3. 
---
So curse of osiris/ whatever should be free.
---
I swear I saw the entire invitation and did not see this.
---
Weird.
---
The best
---
Now I understand why my guardian doesn't ever talk except that 1 time abt cayde.... he's been rebooted thousands of timesüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Shadowkeep was just announced, it comes out in September. The current content is from the Annual Pass
---
Curse of Osiris and Warmind are free right now.
---
If you want Forsaken, the Forsaken annual pass, or Shadowkeep and the Shadowkeep pass, you have to buy those separately.
---
So relatable. It feels terrible to be hyped so much and don't have someone around who you can say something like "Crota is back!!!". Even if you do say that to even your closest friends, they will laugh and ask you to stop playing a dead game and go back to OW or battle royales. 
---
Well ye, asking someone to be interested in something they don't care about is selfish, i know
---
At least there's tons of Destiny-related subreddits
---
If she doesn't say something about cayde I'm gonna be salty
---
[It should be around 2:07 in this](https://youtu.be/947o3mLHCkY)
---
It just feels godawful. Dont know how else to put it. 
---
It seems like everyone is using a mouse and keyboard AND has aim assist. Its ridiculous. 
---
The weapons do not feel properly balanced for PVP and neither do the abilities, especially hunter abilities.
---
Titan abilities just feel too weak in comparison.
---
None of this is normally an issue for me because I have despised the PVP since launch. Its just not good. Unfortunately I need to get the last word which requires me to grind out kills and punishes me for dying. 
---
So being forced to play improperly balanced PVP matches over and over again against the sweatiest basement dwelling nerds I have ever seen in my life, yes, I am unhappy. 
---
They need a playlist where everyone has the same weapons and no abilities because this kind of PVP is simply a clusterfuck of nonfun.
---
Thank you, I had no idea they switched to a pursuits tab now.
---
I feel you on this. I didn't play D1, but I'm still pretty excited for the new content coming out. Even my D2 friends aren't really active/probs have other people or games lul. 
---
I'm just glad that my friends will entertain me and say "oh that's cool" even though they will probably never play the game.
---
*I forgot how it goes* MR. ED!
---
For real real.
---
Oh ok thanks
---
It is subjective. I'm simply telling you how my opinion differs from yours. I'm not using it to back my claim, simply showing you that other opinions exist, which you seem to be negligent about.
---
Bungie have said in their Vidoc that they want the game to be more open and accessible to new players. It's a very smart decision to significantly lower prices. Why would ANYONE be willing to pay (using AUD) $60 for the base game, $30 for Warmind, $30 for CoO, $60 for Forsaken then $55 for Shadowkeep?
---
If you really wanted this game to succeed, you'd be happy they're allowing more people to access the game. Regardless of how much money you've spent thus far.

Raids are end game content so level 50 light level 650-750

Im not demanding, I said they should. When something loses 65$  value in a year and a half, It must have aged quite a bit.
---
Got graviton lance from a nightfall today just a heads up if you need it

Video games age quick. Also they already handed free stuff out for vets

Everyone knows that the Colonel ornament is best ornament

Jk, nice job on the Last Hand ornament.
---
‚ÄúWE‚ÄôVE ANGERED THE HIVE‚Äù
---
Was also kinda hoping to ask the same thing but was scared it would get flagged or deleted.
---
They should like I said, just give us Forsaken and Year 1 DLC's for free. Then I would be okay with it. I never said the new price should be changed. How am I negligent about other peoples opinion when all I said was the game is bad?
---
I relate to everyone here. I wish I had friends. And i would wish they played the game.
---
Oh trust me they know d1  players can‚Äôt stop talking about him and his father
---
Like the DLC's vets most likely already bought just to say they are doing something for us?
---

I can hope but till then, I'm kinda peeved with WF and DE. Probably over $500 USD over 4ish years and nothing but "we hope you keep play on the new account".

I wanted to upvote this comment, but it's at 69. I'm sorry brother
---
I convinced my wife to get back into destiny and play with me so it worked out.
---
Destiny on PS4 WITHOUT PS+ = this - Nightfalls
---
So I own the game on battlenet with Y1 expansions. Can I buy forsaken for $35 and Shadowkeep for $35 on Steam? Do I have to rebuy the game?
---
holy shet didnt notice, mb lol. thanks alot!
---
It takes a screenshot from the phones perspective?
---
I've actually made a habit of sending whispers complimenting players I've encountered on the enemy team that do really well.
---
Be the change you want to see, I guess? Dunno, maybe it's just me.
---
completely agree
---
After completing his conquest as a warlord he settled down to a farm where he "retired."
---
It's not like him and Old McDonald are in the same category
---
even though i've gotten the Forsaken and annual pass on PS4, do i need to buy them again on Steam though?
---
The emote puts you in this perspective then you take the screenshot. Seems strange that a titan has to explain all this to a warlock
---
The misile launcher will be given at the begining of shadowkeep
---
Please don‚Äôt return to destiny, don‚Äôt need toxicity in it bud
---
Google "Destiny 2: New Light".
---
Go away troll, you aren't "correcting" anything.  I've already made the statements you are making now long before you did.  Learn to read and comprehend words and then come back and be an actual useful person instead of an ignorant slob troll.
---
Pfffft it's nothing compared to sentinel titan
---
Actually, when you acquire an ornament, it goes into your inventory with all of your mods.
---
It will stay there until you cursor over it and 'unlock' it.
---
Not sure if it would help but try going to the PS4 home screen hover over the destiny 2 icon till you can press the down button for more about destiny and scroll down to PlayStation store and look at add-ons you might be able to find it there. On a side note and not sure if it's the same for your area but the Destiny 2 Forsaken complete collection is on sale for $39.99 right now till I think 6/17
---
Yes, I am aware. I guess I assumed this person had unlocked it without reading what it was for, but now that I come back to this comment I guess it's possible they didn't look in their mods inventory.
---
Just to clarify, did you look in your inventory in the "modifications" tab?
---
Of course.
---
&gt;and apparently now I can‚Äôt get it back
---
Spider has it. 
---
This is a known bug, as you can see in [the list of known issues near the bottom here](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47917). Nothing to be done about it but do other stuff until there is a bug fix.
---
Maybe one of the Horses of the apocalypse
---
Move warmind down a tier and you have a DLC tier list lol
---
my god, they could just buy the solar system from us and get the final victory.
---
the vex truly win
---
But how else will we tank the whiners karma scores?
---
Titans are probably the best pvp class though?
---
&gt;When cross-save becomes available, am I going to have to rebuy all of the game and DLC that I already own on the next platform?
---
It was mentioned during the Massive Breakdown Podcast Episode 121. They read somewhere that multiple purchases of Shadow Keep don't result in additional season passes to turn in, but in an equivalent amount of silver.
---
Now, why would anyone buy multiple copies of shadow keep? Since Your account is now unified, it might be if you want to switch to a different platform. You already own Shadowkeep on Playstation, including Season 8, but you want to switch to PC after all. So you rebuy Shadowkeep but this time only get silver instead of Season 8 again. That means, Season 8 transfers over and doesn't need to be unlocked on Steam again. **Seasons appear to be transferable.**
---
What further supports this is that you can buy Seasons for Silver. So they might count as MTX. That could be a big loop hole they're using so players who switch don't need to rebuy everything.
---
I have to say when people send me hate mail it feels like winning
---
Makes me wonder where all the progression will be if you "Can do everything right away"
---
Omg yes.
---
Insert John cena music.
---
Reality is often disappointing
---
I searched this thread out before posting on my own. Been having a love-hate affair with this FL. So it was in-out of my vault.
---
But in this Season 7, I took it out to farm for Wendigo. Then in one Gambit final round, where we were behind in Primeval damage by 30-40%, my Titan lay down a Rally Barricade, and pump all 21 rounds into the Primevals within secs. Then emptied all 6 of my Play of the Game GL with Spike into him as well. Boom! Boom! Boom! Prime dead, we won!  
---
Rally Barricade + FL = Boss killa!  
---
And you know what, there is no worries for ammo, whole floor is strewn with white ammo whenever you use FL. So blast way Guardians!
---
Not news my friend, ever since they originally buffed it it‚Äôs been crazy strong in PvP. It‚Äôs probably the strongest super in PvP with maybe Spectral Blades ties with it.
---
You don‚Äôt see many people using it because it‚Äôs by far the hardest super to use well, 90% of the people I see just spam it‚Äôs attacks and miss 90% of the time and don‚Äôt utilise Burst glide well.
---
Only reason I stopped using it was when Nova Warp was completely broken, once that got nerfed I went straight back to Dawnblade.
---
honestly if even one game goes like this they should be banned from PvP for 24 hours
---
Everything is worse on Console not just Dawnblade, It‚Äôs still better then everything else except maybe Spectral Blades.
---
Probably not, although that's more of a Stadia question which I don't know much about
---
Absolutely, yes
---
yeh mate would like some suggestion on this page, i already have the dps spreadsheet file
---
Seems like you should be carrying a sniper for ez headshots.
---
I mean I‚Äôll play with you, I‚Äôm on Xbox so yea x3
---
Download the destiny companion app which has a fireteam section that basically functions as a LFG tool, including the option to invite the ones interested straight into your fireteam.
---
oke thanks, yeah it's confusing thats why i stopped playing it.. don't wanna invest like $200 on a game
---
Some JR commentary on top of this would be fantastic.
---
Get I get that with CHEESE??
---
Yeah, I noticed this happening a ton recently. This says you lost, but the next screen works fine and shows a win like its supposed to. Probably related to the kills post game fix.
---
When you're re-rolling the chest at the end of menagerie, you have a chance for imperials every time. I got a drop of 500 on my 3rd open or something like that
---
How the hell am i a troll now?
---
Is it becouse my dyslexia and that i dont understamd some words cause im finnish?
---
You did say black armory was $40 didnt you?
---
I mean, if you bought both destiny games and every single piece of content released on them at launch, you‚Äôd be paying roughly $6 a month. This is considerably lower than most subscription games, such as RuneScape, Final Fantasy 14 and World of Warcraft, which all cost roughly double that.
---
Lmao, That's litterally me for the past 3 days

The only thing F2P will bring is more cheaters in PVP. Just like it did with CSGO.

You could have at least spelt her name correctly.

I'd totally play a fuck ton more destiny 2 but I really can't afford all the DLC to keep up. I miss one time expansion packs

Kwtd should be banned seriously how do I learn what to do and get 20+ clears if you don't let me do the raid in the first place

So I just google the name of the event when it starts to see the condition?
---
Yes
---
Yeah pretty much. I think there's even an image on this sub that gives a better explanation.
---
Nice, thanks!
---
No destiny 2 is going F2P with paid expansions. New Light players won‚Äôt be able to play Shadowkeep unless they buy it separately.
---
Same bruh I just started playing again after the vidoc
---
It's more about the exotic perks beign beneficial to large fireteams when melting a single target. malfeasance's detonating bullets and rat king's increased dps are inferior to outbreak's nanites that spawn from rapid hits that also increase damage done to whatever enemy they get attached to
---
It‚Äôs already downloaded and available to play, just open up the game and it should be ready to play
---
I‚Äôm here for it
---
Fyi, for the glimmer event, it's not really the drill you shoot. I'm aware you know what to shoot, I just found your explanation confusing. 
---
For those who don't know. It's a little collector that spawns after a few seconds to the side at each site.
---
Alright, thanks! I saw the xbox sale yesterday also but just wasn't sure if I should pick it up at the moment. Appreciate the help.

Not sure If this has been done before, just thought of it

Everyone's going on about Taken Blight memes and I'm just sitting here getting pissed with these damn Ether Rituals.

I go the other way, back the way we come in, run up the stairs, turn left, up into the circular opening, then turn right and run through that engine room or whatever and into the next circular opening on the right. 
---
I want to try that other way though, in of them has to be quicker. Best I've gotten is three more chest opens and I was cutting it very close. Only did that once so far. Having calus minitool in hand, and jump gliding with warlock seems fairly speedy for me so far.
---
I've managed 3 or 4, best way is behind the chest, up stairs, right, left, down the corridor the turn around
---
Four O's to make it go Heroic!
---
You get one from Forsaken.

Had the same problem when I started playing. Did a Google sercu and found a list of all of them (cant remember the link, sorry).

I love this! Only thing I would change is putting to the left of the character tab instead of to the right of the inventory tab. 1, because that‚Äôs how it was in D1 2, it just feels right. Plus it‚Äôll be easier to transition from what we currently have to this.

Thank you fellow guardian !

Blast furnace with feeding frenzy , kill clip , and drop mag

I like to get them just after they kill the first two envoys and then I bubble on the 3rd one

He a acted like it was an rng chance after a certain amount of people showed up

This there are plenty of posts that are sherpa friendly and you can even make your own post asking for help or other like you to go through it together. Watch YouTube videos to get the idea and slowly work though it.
---
Full set of rat kings are pretty stupid tbh.
---
Roughly 8 hours
---
I personally feel it zooms quick enough so I find it not needed
---
It's a mob mentality everybody knows the games are doing fine
---
Thanks, I also find it easyer that way, so I explain it like that.
---
Nice I have it as well just didn‚Äôt recognize the scope
---
Or crucible strats
---
Taken Blight is already hard enough to make heroic with blueberries killing the small blights, now it will be even worse.
---
This is the most relatable thing ever
---
But you were given Destiny 2 free with your PS+ suscription, as an August game. No PS+, no Destiny
---
What‚Äôs your set up for invading?
---
Ugh I had such a hard time trying to find people to play with on destiny so I just stopped
---
Lololol deluxe dlc...i‚Äôll have to look this up but thanks
---
So would a new light guardian just never get any green drops then? Hope they don‚Äôt get any completionist types.
---
Hopefully they just give out a boost item that can be ignored a la forsaken
---
nope
---
I know in the UK you can but the complete edition on amazon for ~¬£17 which includes base game and all dlcs including forsaken. Which sounds silly but I look at as ¬£17 for forsaken (it comes bundled as a download code).
---
Food for thought :)
---
Exactly, I have a 144hz monitor and even as the noticeable difference gets smaller as you go up I much prefer a few extra frames to actual graphical quality.
---
Did you use hammerhead?
---
i was, but even when it wasnt August i could still play it, i could even play it without PS+ only with less features
---
I figured hammerhead would be the recommendation. I've been using whatever highest heavy I get while I get my light up. 
---
I'll have to work on getting the SR3 to see how that feels, as I'm not very good with bows most of the time. Thanks!
---
Thunderlord
---
The "new system" is just like d1 having played it and it being quite a nice feature I'm not surprised why they added it
---
Picture this: You go to gambit with your code of the misile+skullfort, arcstrider build or chaos reach warlock, cleaning ads like your life depends on it and the blueberries picking motes behind you so you don't worry and keeps cleaning ads, then all of the sudden one of them invades with no heavy/super another one dies to a hydra explosion and the last one taken out by an enemy invader all of them carrying 10-15 motes... Oh the horror...
---
To be fair, that's one of the hardest ones to just discovered on your own.
---
Lol, did you piss him off in crucible or something?
---
Well what level and power are you?
---
Yeah I learned on the forums I have to live with it.
---
I think the blight one is trickier because it's easier to trigger heroic on the third set, so you have some people shooting the big blight, some people shooting the little blights to get it to third set, and some people who are new and don't know the mechanics and shoot randomly into the air.
---
When I go to amazon and search "destiny 2 complete collection" the complete collection doesn't come up, but there is the legendary collection that I think is the one you see. If you buy that, you would have to buy the annual pass separately if you wanted it. 
---
It would be a better deal to buy them separately like that ($20 USD for forsaken on amazon, $15 for annual pass on battle net), with the amazon sale, so I will keep that in mind for people in the future who ask how to buy!
---
Join the destiny 2 PC lfg discord, there's over 100k members, can find a group for literally anything in game. If you browse discord it should be at the top somewhere, just add in your battle net and you're gtg
---
Do us all a favor and fuck off noob, no one even wants you to play this game.
---
Thank you for your reply! I was afraid of it just being stuck in the general loot pool... I had one with Dragonfly and Explosive Head and loved it, however after some update Dragonfly got replaced by Rampage. Still not a bad roll, though I generally like my traits/perks to remain the same instead of changing without my discretion...
---
My first time in there was a shock. I haven't seen red enemies since I started playing D2. Immune to my weapons? Shit, it's been a long time.

Holy audio-lip desync, Batman!
---
the Colonel &amp; Louis ate them all
---
I guess since the DLC is paid, and the base game is free, it's F2P with P2P elements? It's free as much as Runescape is F2P upto a certain point. 
---
Although conversely by that logic WoW is also free because the first 20 levels are free, so...IDK really.
---
It could be 750, if Shadowkeep raises it to 800 or higher.
---
Try using skull, often you don't get anything back. Like you said, not worth using anymore. At least shards always gives you at least 20% but still not really worth it.

You will also have said noobs on your team. Its a two way street.
---
not if you bring buddies
---
Never too late to start.  You are looking at least 300 hours of gameplay from the start to get near the highest power level.  If you buy Forsaken and start with a character boost looking at over 100 hours of game to get to higher levels. The gameplay is lot better from Forsaken onwards

What letter is it when a kind stranger agrees to help you with a quest, but you keep screwing it up because you're not very good, and you feel bad because you think they are annoyed at you for wasting their time, but actually they've been in your position before, so they know what it's like and they honestly want to help you?

He‚Äôs talking about the light, light, heavy combo in Arc Staff
---
[This is what I‚Äôm waiting for.](https://i.imgur.com/Pm16qYW.gifv)
---
Too bad there is final kill camera  replay. Thats in promo view only.
---
Guess we pullinthe internet cords again
---
Went to tangled shore today trying to capture some prisoners, before I was able to grab the orb, it disappears.
---
And it happened 3 times straight.  I uninstalled the game.

Do you own forsaken? The power surge bounties require you to complete that campaign first. For XP run a fireteam medallion and do your weekly and daily powerfuls for strikes crucible and gambit. Flashpoint and all that weeklt stuff will get you powered up. Run multiple characters if you have the time. Primes drop more often when you are under 500 power so just playing the game and killing stuff will be your best bet. Lost sectors and public events like its your life for now. Adventures and missions. Bounties from NPCs at the tower. Phew it is exhausting sometimes.
---
There's a heavy attack and combos in arc staff? Huh, TIL. 
---
I'll have to try that, I just started levelling the spinny arc staff middle path.
---
There is no such letter. These individuals are mere myth.
---
Those supers are not longer than the striker super. Might wanna look into that.
---
if this is the new finisher type moves were going to have im personally not a fan. seems too gimmicky.
---
I own forsaken. What are the power surge bouinties? sorry its been a while since i've played . I only started back because she was interested in playing
---
Ask yourself did I trow enough grenade .
---
Uh...
---
Did you?....
---
This is the comment I came here to see and now I'm out.
---
No shaxx is disappointed in me
---
They'll be hosted on Steam. VAC is a little overzealous when it comes to cheating anyway as I understand. I think we'll be ok.
---
Still don't understand why there's no indication anywhere in game that even says events can be made heroic.
---
Currently trying to unlock the green runes just for this reason. I'm tired of Luna's. Is Austringer better than Better Devils?
---
Loads today
---
Link me to something where i understand every heroic event thing please.
---
Too bad you have to buy them.
---
Pc ?
---
Oh that's a nice one! Love the look.
---
It shouldn't be that hard, the **vast** majority of people who started playing D2 early actually ended up quitting around the first DLC's release or shortly after, so basically everyone here now is either a new player who joined after that time, or a returning player who managed to muddle through just fine.
---
Xbox? My man.
---
Yeet
---
&gt;They haven't beaten the story of Forsaken yet
---
This would be the problem. The criteria according to the Bungie website are to be level 50 and finish the Forsaken campaign.
---
