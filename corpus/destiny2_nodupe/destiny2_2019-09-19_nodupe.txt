Cool, every day you learn something new

---
Haha, so true.

---
It also took them a while to notice our satellites were off line right before the attack on the tower.  
---
I was going to jump on the first Dead Orbit ship off this crazy planet, but for some strange reason Arach is no longer talking to me.
---
No lie I once invaded with 11 motes don't why but I got like 2 kills and made it back safe (as it was I think the other team was getting stomped by mine) so it didn't really make much a difference whether I loss them or not.
---
Did the same Wed Thur Fri. I will go in on Tuesday as content won‚Äôt work till 1pm assuming servers survive
---
You think that's bad try having the Invasion portal sit open repeatedly and no one but you invades.
---
What‚Äôs this vid called? I wanna watch it, can‚Äôt wait for moons haunted day, pre-ordering digital deluxe for two-tailed fox and ornament.
---
i was doing Crown a few weeks ago and everyone had absolute shit damage... but i was sitting over there with 5 mil i think
---
Yeah a longer campaign would be great CoO was only like 2 hours long from start to finish. And some more strikes would be nice I mean without the strike being tied to a dlc but just added in for more variety.
---

I remember this one.
---
Finally a post I can relate to entirely. Every, single, clip.
---
‚ÄúI really needed that Spare Rations‚Äù
---
Yes. 
---
Maybe. 
---
It's RNG... and subjective.
---
Fuck the recluse grind tho, honestly makes me wanna break the keyboards of all those OEM titan apes in comp every single time I am pitted against 4 of them.
---
Something like the Vidoc 3, it‚Äôs on the bungie or destiny YouTube channel. They talk about what‚Äôs to come in shadowkeep and after.
---
K, thanks
---
You don't need to buy it now since on october first the base game is going to become free to play. That'll give you a chance to try it out, play that story, play the first raid and then decide if you want to buy the additional content
---
Nice. I have highest seniority and am 1 of 3 bosses. I let everyone know exactly the good time I‚Äôm gonna have.
---
Canonically the rest of the guardians go to the dreaming city. It's not just us. There are many more entries. There's one in particular on one of the dreaming city weapons, it goes something like one of the awoken goes to the city to ask for help. There are guardians playing with the purple ball, some gearing up, stuff like that. Idk. And they give a small speech about asking for help with the dreaming city, that there will be tons of loot and that the Awoken's secrets will be revealed.
---
Damn I don't even get this many views on YouTube wtf
---
Mourn. There is nothing else.
---
Technically weapons but Traveler‚Äôs Chosen paired with Fighting Lion has been a lot of fun recently.
---
I want to think of a clever response but it‚Äôs not my turn to use the brain cell
---
I recently got a good service revolver with outlaw/snapshot and I love it. Though I mostly use it for clean up, when I get into a 1v1 I can always trust my service.
---
No
---
Meta in PvP right now is grenade launchers, the recluse, and shotguns. I don't use them because I'm not a bitch but if you want easy kills that require no skill use those. If not, the machina dei 4 is a really good pulse rifle, any 180 hand cannon like the nature of the beast and west of sunfall 7 are pretty good, if you like a slower hand cannon then rose is real nice. Auto rifles are kinda meh, scathelocke is a real good choice but if you like the slower firing ones like me then the cuboid aru is nice, though it is a rare one. Pve is kinda whatever you want, but for boss damage its good to have outbreak perfected if you can get it, otherwise a sniper rifle would be fine
---
Notice how all of those are year 1. None of those have random rolls or can have a mod on them
---
MIDA , Erintil.
---
Ahaha he said it boys where his gold
---
May I ask if you have this without the text?
---
yeah OP weapons tend to do that
---
That triumph score thoüò∞
---
Please stop you‚Äôre scaring my dog! Oh wait no that‚Äôs ups never mind, you‚Äôre just scaring me.
---
Aren‚Äôt you the jerkoff guy?
---
Love the pic. A++++
---
Haven't gotten outbreak yet but I wreck shit with my blast furnace.
---
I heard they will make gambit free and you can go to all zones but to do the quests or get items and exotics you need to actually buy forsaken
---
This is the only exotic I‚Äôm missing smh same thing happened to me with OEM and Luna couldn‚Äôt enjoy the broken ness.
---
Go play CoD, this is Destiny
---
Do normal gambit for auto rifle kills, lots more red bar enemies.  Prime has a handful more bullet sponges for primary weapons
---
Mhm, makes sense
---
Love blowing out Saladin‚Äôs back.
---
Looks like the size of a dog tag.
---
Warlocks use well tho
---
The weapon you can get from Dinklebot is called "Lucian's Call". It rewards critical hits by returning ammo to the mag, and having the bullets ricochet. It also freezes targets
---
I hate to break it to you but you are currently sitting at around 2100 and you have like a .94 overall and you have about a week and a half realistically for someone of your skill level it would almost be impossible this is based on the account that I checked which is your reddit name so I think it's yours if you accomplish this task I will personally give you a gold star sticker and a fresh baked cookie
---
Last man standing is just like sole survivor for me hardly every see it:(
---
I wish destiny was like it was in vanilla, dark, below and house of wolves I was obsessed with the game and it felt like it had a stronger and bigger community with more hype and energy around the game
---
I've played pvp games most of my life now and Destiny's pvp is by far the most frustrating to play (barring ddossers on other games.)
---
This game has made me prefer pve over pvp.
---
Same

What is that emblem
---
The only reason I won't watch this is because I know how boring VoG is to watch. (I mean, the Templar is almost a half hour of shooting goblins, fanatics, and oracles.)

What's that?

Get ready to watch me climb, Imma do it or imma die trying.

Before I can change your mind you're going to have to explain what teamshot means to me.

Bungie Movie of the Week.  Go read the last "This Week at Bungie" update on bungie.net.  Each week's winner is normally at the end.

I‚Äôm a hunter main that tends to either slide, jump, or crouch peek depending on map, lane, and weapon I‚Äôm holding. I‚Äôve watched plenty of videos and I can dominate in stuff like iron banner. Shit like survival and clash piss me off cause all people do is titan ape or hand held supernova with contraverse hold.

Wish I had a decent hunter or the fighting lion XD

Virgin guardian vs chad o‚Äôkeefe
---
Ummm, can I just say I'm fucking overwhelmed by the fact that annual pass content is available for all forsaken players (including myself) now??
---
I'd been meaning to buy it, but between one thing and the other I couldn't really spend the cash needed. I was fully prepared to forgo this year's annual pass content so that I could play shadowkeep, and yesterday I logged in to find it all unlocked...
---
Quit it Bungo, you're gonna make me cry :')
---
If on a warlock you can use well and rifts if you don‚Äôt have FL try using any other gl With proximity grenades IronBanner drops them you can also use colony if you have it. If you on a titan idk I didn‚Äôt try it on my titan.
---
Wait so only if we pay we get extra shit?
---
That's a real Chad move.
---
*CHAD O'KEEF*
---
DON'T FORGET, YOU ARE HERE FOREVER.
---
The battle net to steam transfer does not change anything besides how you launch the game. It won't magically give or take away anything. 
---
For new players just starting, on October 1 when the game moves off of battle net and on to steam, select portions of it will be free to play. [For details see the Shadowkeep, cross save, and year 3 FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/by457o/faq_shadowkeep_cross_save_free_to_play_and_more/) from the sticky post in this subreddit.
---
That's generally how having free and premium tracks works for battle-pass systems, yeah.
---
Loot-a-palooza key spawns chests too. They‚Äôre a bitch to get to. They‚Äôre on the radar.
---
Ya but you get the paid battle pass if you buy shadowkeep with the season pass
---
It‚Äôs all the hunters not realizing they‚Äôre easily the best class. Not going to assume it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre all bad players incapable of using hunter to it‚Äôs fullest advantage, but it‚Äôs definitely a sizable amount.
---
Wavesplitter. Works pretty good and everyone hates seeing it for some reason. Win-win!
---
And also Blast Furnace. Especially for Midtown.
---
I've only been getting last man standing, usually the first gun I get is the only thing I'll get for the week. If it makes you feel better, the only one with one two punch I got has Auto loading holster
---
Sounds good, hi!!
---
Haha well be up there kicking some ghost ass soon enough haha I didn‚Äôt realise there was so many uk guardians
---
If I am correct I think the reason for the Blind Well is to drive away the 'dark' (this can be as in a way of nor making the Curse a bigger problem ) meaning that having the Blind Well always on they can hold back the Curse, but the Well can't stop the Curse.
---
Again this is Just my theory. But it is the way I understand untderstand this lore. (I like destiny lore)
---
Beeing able to count the pixels...
---
you say that like you are suprised bl3 is a good game.
---
I would also like to point out that at least half of them also crutch on oem, I cry every time.
---
I‚Äôm sure so many play. If I remember correctly, Henry Cavill played WOW a lot. At least Ice-T‚Äôs voice is insanely distinctive. I could be playing with Cavill for years, calling him Henry and not even know it was him. Hell, his tag could be ‚ÄúRealSupermanHC and I probably wouldn‚Äôt pick up on it.
---
And my chicken
---
Forgive my ignorance on the matter; Destiny is my first game of this type, with a fully online play, and raids and such. 
---
Why did people complain about campaigns having bosses at the end?
---
:P
---
When you say "shouldn't be strike bosses," I'm not quite sure what you mean. Xol is a boss at the end of a campaign, AND also a Raid, right? Is one of these not received well by fans?
---
Sorry for all the questions, new to this type of game.
---
Is one two punch really good because ive been aiming for a pvp roll that consists of rifled barrel or full choke, accurized rounds, opening shot, swashbuckler, and a range masterwork. I pick swashbuckler because i shoulder charge ALOT both in pve and pvp so swashbuckler comes in very handy for me. Or should i go for one with one two punch?
---
No, he's not a raid boss. The last story mission of the Warmind campaign is also reused as a Strike.
---
Uuh,  if it was a boss like Nokris (not very important) everybody would be fine. But you see, Xol is a powerful god and we just kill him with a fire stick. Ghaul is also very powerful . Like, they are too powerful for just one 10-minute mission. People are really annoyed by that
---
yes it does make sense . i understand that pve players want the shiny pvp guns , but do they have to complain? just cuz some1 is bad doesn't mean that they have to whine and say that comp is shit
---
first why did i get downvoted n did i make a error
---
Whatever it is, I want it!
---
In case you feel bad on missing out - you're not. I'm max level and I never had less fun playing Destiny in the last few months. 
---
Not even sure why, bc I generally like PvP, but yesterday was just bad. 4/5 games with mercy rule, people afk, not capturing and the enemy full of mountaintop+ recluse hunters that jump and shoot and bottom tree strikers with OEM.
---
Ok thanks lots I will look into it
---
Lined paper or blank sheets?
---
Agreed! I refused to play D1 after TDB (around Feb the following year), was so disappointing, and they essentially made Vault of Glass redundant. AND I never ever got that drop from Crota, despite doing it 3 times every week for 2 months.
---
Now, I can‚Äôt put down D2. There‚Äôs always something interesting to do and it feels minimal repetitive. I feel I get rewarded if I work hard, but I don‚Äôt have ALL the guns, so I always feel like I‚Äôm working towards something. D2, as a looter shooter, has never been better
---
They could totally do that with the Infinite Forest.
---
Not really, im really bad at pvp. So i crutch. 
---
But just because you dont like certain exotics or loadouts, doesnt mean you can decide for others what they can use.
---
I don't expect anyone to buy it for my. I was expressing my consternation at MS asking me to pay for it 2 weeks before release.
---
I don't need to mow lawns to earn money. I work full time. I'm a 36 year old married father of two. The reason I can't afford it this side of my next pay day is due to the expense of hotels and travel arrangements I had to pay for so that my 9 year old daughter can take part in her upcoming gymnastics competition.
---
Sounds like you are one of those lazy bastards that were born with silver fork in their arse ;)
---
Can't buy it on bnet anymore, but the bundle should be the same when the games goes to steam on the first.
---
If you're on PC that is. It's still purchasable on PS4 and Xbox.
---
Buy it on a credit card. Pay it off when you get paid.
---
Did I forget to mention defensive strike? ;)
---
Now I'm not trying to say someone is fucking this riven cheese
---
*looks at 100k damage down there*
---
Butimjustsayin
---
Why do I never find one of those lobbies I‚Äôd love to do that
---
So would I honestly (really want that crota armor) but I'd also rather have new content
---
I enjoy destiny, doing raids with mates and stuff is fun but so is messing about on borderlands or farming to level 50
---
Who wouldn‚Äôt
---
Looks like it‚Äôs going to maybe be a heroic menagerie loot drop. Dunno what runes to use.
---
I see a lot of people that are randomnameGAMING. They put gaming at the end of their name to advertise their YouTube or twitch.
---
this is a horrible idea simply because of pvp reasons. it was fun in pve but there's no way they're bringing it back without changing it completely.
---
Those items become avalible October 1st
---
I have pre ordered and don‚Äôt have them yet, therefore I assume you will get them Oct 1st. 
---
I know with forsaken you got the pre order bonuses after finishing the campaign on at least one character (although that was a ornament for the gun you get the quest for post campaign).
---
K thanks
---
Still no clue what those little black boxes with red things sticking out of them is.
---
Earliest I could find said 3.2 million for destiny back in 2014. 
---
Couldn't find a good recent source, there is an article saying it just rose above 1 million back in june. Destinytracker.com says 429k played pve and 420k played pvp yesterday, but I dont know how those numbers overlap or if it includes all platforms and stuff. I'd use warmind.io but I know that one requires you to register before it tracks you so there's no way it would be accurate.
---
Lol, if you guys hate pulse rifles now you're really gonna hate Shadowkeep.
---
Nope, Rapid Hit, Outlaw and Drop Mag are non-stackable in any way.
---
I have 1600 hours on D1 and 1200 hours on D2. Not new hehe. The new one must be the guy who was hitting me because I'm 750 LP. But thanks anyway and thanks for reminding me about the light difference in IB, I forgot about it .
---
Yes do that my man
---
No prob, I kinda was surprised if you were new, how tf did u get juju so quick, I still am lazy to grind for it
---
He's using Chaperone with Luna's howl on bottom tree sentinel with One Eyed Mask, that's all can tell you for sure
---
I can agree with NLB, I kinda had the same thoughts with Icebreaker but there were soooooo many people saying how much they want it back so I just wanted to see how many others wanted the same thing
---
who hurt you lmao

Hahah. I got the weapon i guess the first day but the catalyst i had to wait a little bit more. Cost a lot of materials üòÇ but worth it.
---
This actually just took me 2 runs, the 4un i did it on took 45 min.
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs L3-R4, definitely not L1-L5, just make sure to avoid R3-L2.
---
Emotes are the most pure form of communication
---
&gt;Seems

and
---
&gt;Because they were bigger and better

These to things do not belong together. If they were bigger and better they WERE not seemed.
---
Oh yeah, for sure you're right.  I only have Kindled Orchid (of the two).
---
I wish I had the money to give you a platinum award
---
Why the hate, pvp has a lot to it now, supers are just horrendous imo but that doesn't mean I'm all out for calling out bungie for horrible game design, it needs balance in pvp now and so what if halo pvp was great, nothing last forever and everything changes, learn to get over it
---
1. Outbreak perfected 2. Mountaintop 3. Thunderlord
---
I for one want to see it come back, but as a primary. Nerfed damage In PvP so that it doesn‚Äôt become game breaking, but keep it relatively unchanged in PvE. Maybe buff the ammo regain and add some taken ornaments since I would like to see the desolate armor sets come back as exotic shaders.
---
It‚Äôs broken and bungie won‚Äôt fix it but yeah the memes are getting ridiculous
---
Overshield activate!
---
Cool concept but too many Titles would get really annoying to see in the Tower. I think the Triumph Seals are special enough - just wish they weren't all purple.
---
I just picked D2 back up after a year long hiatus and I don't see why people are still grinding for pinnacle and other weaponry.  Isn't it all going to be replaced in a matter of weeks?  New pinnacle weapons will be out shortly.  New exotic quests.  Am I missing something?
---
Handcannons are very unique to destiny. I don't know any other game that has an entirely separate and populated Handcannon subtype. I'd hope they stayed top tier in this game simply because it's one of the things destiny offers that most other games don't.
---
If you find them annoying, maybe see what you can do to counter them. Positioning and movement come to mind. (assuming ur on about pvp)
---
If ur on about pve, no one forces you to use them.
---
I would like to meet the poor fool who tries this.
---
Can't wait till Chad O'Keefe releases!
---
Apologies
---
The pinnacle weapons on offer now are great. Its armor getting a massive overhaul so weapons will largely remain the same
---
Lucky raspberry
---
That's because Guardians are literally unkillable most of the time. Even an unskilled one gets the job done eventually.
---
sounds about right
---
Oh, thanks. Thought it was scheduled to this week's reset. Gonna give a break from the game these days.
---
Molag Caballed
---
Wow that's epic
---
Light bearers definitely aren't immune to pain, plenty of lore to suggest as much, though after being killed every way imaginable I'm willing to bet that the tolerance is unfathomable.
---
And gambit
---
what dance is that? it hasn‚Äôt dropped for me
---
I just think sniper headshot should be the only one shot that isn‚Äôt heavy ammo
---
Especially Scout Rifle and Auto Rifle is extremely bad on pc, you can see no one using these during a fight, also we must use these against tons of guys using Recluse Mountaintop LOTW Jot√ºnn. That taste is such a pain.
---
Minagire while the more loot fridays is on
---
How?
---
I've been requesting this everywhere for at least a year without gaining any traction from the community.. could easily add the character customization to the options screen.
---
There is nothing wrong with any of those weapons except if I see you pull out a bow for Boss DPS you will get murdered in your sleep.
---
Yeah I was inspired by my multiple deaths last night hahahaha!
---
Oh daaaaamn, il have to grab that from the vault and give it a go but it‚Äôs still not the same! üòÇ
---
^^^^^ this especially with grenade/rocket launchers
---
What problems did it lead to that we wouldnt have otherwise had then?  
---
  
---
I don't particularly car that we had no say. What does that have to do with anything?   
---
Also, we might not have had any say in our resurrection. But your foremost argument was that we have no choice in whether we fight or not, which is just blatantly false. Lots of Lightbearers dont work with the Vanguard and with the Traveler.
---
Shotgun apes make it worse because I get frightened and kill the both of us lmao

You have to wait until shadowkeep launches on steam and then you can buy forsaken.
---
1. Oxygen SR3 - Because of Meganeura
---
2. Le Monarque - Popping those heads is fun 
---
3. Izanagi's Burden - Really great for DPS
---
You started off well but as you can tell by other replies there was no need to express your weapon preference - a new player is asking for advice on the game, not what weapons you think he should use/not use.
---
I clearly said "not meta, but better" about Scouts so thanks for repeating that to me.
---
I know people with 50k+ Kills on their bows, they're insanely ranged and insanely strong and have the highest damage per shot of any primary ammo weapon. They're not mediocre at all.
---
Sidearms are very very strong and yes of course they have  an intended range - thats like saying Swords aren't good for sniping, they have a range in which they're effective and they're effective within that range. You can't make the claim that a Sidearm is bad because their range is small.
---
You're not handicapping yourself by using weapons you like, take your opinions elsewhere.
---
I'm a Titan main who uses an Auto, Fusion, and Sword - no Exotic weapons, and I get by just fine.
---
&amp;#x200B;

OP was asking for things Veterans don't like seeing in terms of generic gameplay, not weapon choice.

Typical destiny player. Hates facts. Proceeds with insults. This sub became toxic like its people irl. Never seen shittier people than on this sub.

What‚Äôs the curated Night Watch?

Stupid right? its like month or so without possibility to buy the game... Annoying af :(
---
So your mentality is if it's not the "best" it's not good?
---
Don't listen to his weapon advice. This is coming from a top 200 player - use whatever weapons you like using man.
---
1: **Izinagi‚Äôs Burden**
---
It‚Äôs the perfect sniper imo, it does everything you need it to do 
---
2:**Not Forgotten**
---
Need I say more?
---
3:**Ace of Spades**
---
I‚Äôve got solid legendary energy and heavy weapons, which frees up my kinetic slot very nicely
---
Yes PC has a rediculius hand cannon scene
---
Vigilance is good right now. I decided to finish the catalyst last month and maybe did it in like 20 matches. As long as you give yourself a little distance you will outgun almost everything

Thank fucking god

 I don't know. At the level of new players you can win matches making not a single shot just by shoulder charges alone. Which is fun in itself. So I don't mind.

No. It doesn't grant the loot anymore. Just lets you do the activation

Put shotgun dominance in there too

I have it on PC thanks to cross save, just not Forsaken DLC, darn those console-peasant friends of mine
---
Talk about a [perfect fit](https://imgur.com/a/7rnbqAu)! Thanks to both of you :)
---
I would play more prime but the invasions are too frequent, it doesn‚Äôt seem as much of a problem in classic.
---
I hate crucible. Love gambit.
---
Holy shit
---
Fuck it they should just restart with zero then to avoid confusion. Lol
---
Ive done that to a friend of mine while fighting Xol. 
---
I told him to get really close to Xol and to shoot him in his mouth üòÅ
---
youre right, how dare i talk bad about YOUR favourite video game company
---
1. Loaded Question. Great all around
---
2. Right side of wrong. I just love how the gun feels in PVP
---
3. Prospector. Lovely with a couple reserve mods
---
Yeah, I lost all of my trust for Calus when this season came out after hearing "O Champion mine", and more so when I learned about the Chronicon
---
I actually died watching this
---
They'll be in-game on October 1st. Most likely at the Postmaster.
---
I‚Äôm more intrigued about the error you seem to get and maybe try to find a solution to it, did you contact support or checked the FAQ in that regards?

What ya mean?
---
ADS deployed, you can stop worrying about grenades now.
---
haha thats for sure
---
Robot have no feeling of pain I'm good
---
Sorry for being unclear, I agree that it's pretty fun to mess around with heated players but in the end I don't have any resentment against them :)
---
Man, we‚Äôve tried clearing this boss yesterday at least a dozen times, I guess. Watching people solo this mission is pretty degrading for us. Lol
---
I guess we just don‚Äôt have the skills and loadout yet. So maybe we are gone try with a strategy like yours. SMG clearing adds and tether super with knights and boss. Does the chalice in the middle does something special?
---
No truer words have been spoken
---
Dancehall found in best of year one engrams
---
Oh haha yea none at all i just look at it afterwards and laugh
---
wow it's cool to see that bungie isn't the only one reusing content
---
hot take: destiny 2 looks better with f.lux on
---
When Destiny appears on Steam it'll be in its new Destiny: New Light free-to-play form, which will include vanilla Destiny 2 and a small sampling of missions from the Forsaken and Shadowkeep expansions. 
---
Neither New Light nor Shadow Keep will contain the full Forsaken content. That will need to be purchased separately, but last time I looked Steam still didn't have a separate page for that particular expansion. It'll probably appear when New Light/Shadowkeep goes live.
---
You, fine sir just blew my mind. This needs more attention. Now if we believe in the Multiverse-theory we can excuse endless hours of playing Destiny by saying I am doing my part in saving one of our endless parallel universes. Ty.
---
lol yep
---
I did the same thing my first match after getting MT, paired it with OEM and bottom tree Striker Titan. Being the cancer that plagues PVP for a few matches was too much fun!

I-it's not like i was trying to mark you for vengeance or anything!...unless?

Hate it solo, love it with a sqaud
---
Yep

We are a bunch of OP god slayers at this point.

My favorite thing is to respond politely for the first few, then send pics of Dr. Phil hugging someone random and repeating who hurt you.
---
Its weird tho because a lot of activities dont seem to have localchat actve, even if u can type in it. Gambit does this sometimes too
---
In rumble it's great. You don't lose anything and are potentially helping others.
---
Dark souls 3 which doesn't adjust your sound to what you set unless you start the game
---
Then why do they have a consistently huge player Base? You talk about balancing issues but literally every single game has that, hell look at destinies history with Prometheus and low. You can dance around the question of if it‚Äôs so bad why is it still one of the most popular games. They moved to a more competitive style long before mechs were added. Don‚Äôt talk like destiny is the perfect shooter, it‚Äôs got tonnes of problems regarding weapon types being pretty trash such as scouts or auto rifles aswell as issues with supers being absurdly powerful currently.
---
I don‚Äôt even play fortnite I‚Äôm just sick of this circlejerk of fortnite bad minecraft good without giving any and decent points as to why.
---
Jotunn only drops from bergusia
---
Um imo as a titan main trying out a warlock dawnblade is the best super. Great range, speed, and length.
---
Its a time trial, you have to complete them in a certain amount of time for the emblem. Just completing them wont unlock the emblem
---
Same except I use riskrunner in place of skyburner. Ive tried other setups but I keep coming back to this.
---
.....
---
Count me as well
