Not sure why people are downvoting. It's a dumb choice for them to pull the DLC, I'm not going to pay $60 when I only need the one DLC.

lol nah BlueWestlo tweeted the template right away and I happened to have a tab of Elon Musk open. The caption practically wrote itself

Platform?
---
So happy I played the demo before I wasted my money.
---
I felt good at 705 until the third wave. I felt like I was getting one shot killed constantly.
---
Quick question about cross-platform: I’ve had D2 on PS4 for a while now, but I recently made the switch to PC. Can I buy destiny for free then transfer my PS4 save to PC?

Glad to help!
---
Can you provide a link for proof?
---
You gotta upgrade the first slot of three on the bottom right
---
That or you can transfer your acc to Destiny: New Light and itll just give you all your content
---
Did OP get the grey pigeon? or did OP stop playing Destiny?
---
I had said this earlier today that I felt like it was rushed out after it was datamined and leaked on YouTube
---
Ahhh thanks, i saw them in the xol strike. They could be to tease tge upcoming expansion
---
The game is no longer gonna be on battle.net, it's being moved to steam.
---
The deluxe edition of shadowkeep is shadowkeep which is the first season, and then the annual pass for the later 3 seasons
---
*Activates Selfie Emote*

Steam exclusive good

Epic exclusive bad.

While season of opulence is good so far I thought the same thing about jokers wild and I ended up dropping destiny after a wee or so because I was already tired of gambit shit.
---
Many think it has to do with bad juju... And that these will be similar to dreaming cities corrupted eggs
---
Just let it die. Ignore the whole company until they lose big and beg us to come back.
---
You got to play for almost two years.
---
Same and same. Foxxyz95, add me when u can :). Leave a comment tho so i know it's you!
---
These weapons' quests require the annual pass.
---
I think more accurate is, "Moon's *STILL* haunted."
---
Can you get selfie in eververse rn? Ive been waiting for that forever too.
---
Yes it will as the whole base game is free to play in September
---
I wanna put it on my ssd so bad but it just can’t happen
---
I’ve spent $310 on this series and temporarily quit playing after curse of osiris, I’m perfectly happy with warmind, forsaken, and the annual pass.
---
Yes. [Source](https://www.bungie.net/en-US/Explore/Detail/News/47882)
---
It used to be on its own but they added in those two content expansions for free as a bundle.
---
The price didn’t change, they just threw them on for no additional price but yeah it doesn’t make sense for returning veterans.
---
It’s funny as hell man, good job. I’d edit it and give you credit if I could.
---
Forsaken is/was great! (Save for a certain exo) but after d1, d2 and osiris I kinda just had a bad taste in my mouth for preorders. Dont get me wrong if it's good. Which it sounds like it probably will be. I will shell out that 40 bucks in a heartbeat.
---
Ahhh.. the stand offs with that bastard were epic😂
---
So what about people who got D2 for free back during that promotion? 
---
I never installed it nor made a character but does this mean I will have D2 on my steam account at some point?
---
for someone who would pride themself on being wise, that was quite an unwise response, i was merely complimenting your intelligence, there was no reason to make mine look inferior. Engagements like these make me wish the City could unite Guardians of all classes to act as one, raising each other up, rather than trying to lower others in hopes to raise one’s self up.
---
Never played d1, and I've enjoyed all of my time in D2. I have no reason to not get it. I just don't have the funds at this minute to
---
What the actual fuck
---
The only part of it that sucks, Is I will no longer be able to buy expansions with WoW gold
---
They’ve steadily been streaming out content through the annual pass, this is the most content destiny has ever gotten in a year. They can’t pump out Forsaken size DLCs every 3 months, so they stick to a yearly release for the bigger DLC. 
---
With the annual pass you get 2 new raids, access to the black armory forges, gambit prime and Reckoning, Menagerie, new exotic quests, the Zero Hour mission, to name a few.
---
You’re obviously following the vanguards propaganda
---
Oh you mean Rockets McDickface?
---
Yeah I'm in my 30s as well so I'm in the same boat as you. But you should really really really try and change his decision. Lol help him ascend so he never has to look back. Haha
---
i actually was kinda hoping this would be a title based on getting all the base-game titles (or something like that)
---
K e k s I s
---
its 500 not 600.
---
Who let the Daleks in?
---
So, what happens to Forsaken? Does Shadowkeep include it?
---
How new players will get access to Forsaken? It isn't mentioned nor listed on Steam. Destiny 2, Curse of Osiris and Warmind are. I'm asking because right now D2: Forsaken is at $60 on Battlenet, and Shadowkeep Deluxe edition it's at $25~ on Steam.
---
i’m simply a Titan looking for peace, i do not stand with the Vanguard, and i do not stand with the Drifter. i stand for Peace
---
Can we take a moment and just realize that nobody really gives a shit that its exclusive to steam? 5 bucks says everyone would be flipping a table if it was the epic store
---
Everyday I have nightmares... of screeching like I’ve never heard before... it keeps me awake too long now... let’s kill that bitch again...
---
If the players choose to spend the money, and continue doing so, is it really a rip-off? They obviously value the dlc more than they do the money.
---
I actually don't even buy the dlc, because I don't value it that much, but I won't deride them for that.
---
Sorry, I was just bringing up an example of something (hopefully) we would agree on. Not intending on implying you are a bigot, but that was poor phrasing.
---
I think my goal is to make Nintendo and Microsoft afraid to roll it back. I was frustrated the last generation with the lack of cross play, but it seemed like I was alone. I begrudgingly bought my Xbox One, because I wanted to play with my friends and that's what they moved to.
---
You're right that Microsoft can roll back cross play if they regain significant market share. This seems to be more of a move of desperation. But now that they made it, The hope is that public pressure will force their hand to keep it. Consumers are getting more power (if recent backlashes are anything to go on), and this is something developers love too. Microsoft will find themselves in a very awkward position come next gen if they revert.
---
Putting this pressure on Sony is not just about sending a message to Sony. Maybe even more so, it's about sending a message to Microsoft and Nintendo that this is important enough that we will not let this generation's darling get away with it, so they won't get away with it in the future either.
---
Again sorry if I implied anything more than that.
---
Must've been oblivious to the "lol" as in sarcasm, including the emblem part. That should've been obvious. You're judging skills are subpar at best. Getting called entitled due to sarcasm and completely misreading my question I asked which was pertaining towards if the people who paid get something (idc what, I just didn't want to miss out on it if there happened to be). I'm sure we can all pay for hundreds of games and expansions to come. Tf lol, Internet mfs always talk to talk 😂

I read an article about the making of anthem and how the leadership team didn’t want anyone comparing anthem to destiny. If they did they would learned not to make the same mistakes ad the first destiny

You can organize by bounty and and quest in the upper right corner of the pursuits tab. Just click on the arrow thingy.

I think it already does that.

It’s a video from Cyhi the Prince when he visited for Kanye’s Sunday Service that he performs every Sunday with a choir group called The Samples. Many musical guests attend and hundreds of snippets can be found on YT, IG and Twitter. They also performed at Coachella as well.

---
With 2 grenade shots you literally do as much damage as a 1k shot but it takes time. So to speed it up a bit you use your shotgun after you place to shots on whatever your killing
---
Ooooooohhhhh
---
Osrs spilling over again
---
Yup. Still think it can be polished. You could fit everything im one page before. Mouse and keyboard take 1 second to click the o4ganize button. But on console or using controller its much slower to traverse the screen. Having smaller tiles and organizeing those two buttons nrxt to each other is but 1 simple improvement off the top of my head.

Fair point, I personally just wish there was a hotkey to the pursuit tab

On Steam? Should be able to, yeah

It won't be on steam until September, and any purchases made on battle.net will transfer over
---
The game is migrating from battle.net to steam, you will keep all your data so their is really no reason to wait. You can get the complete collection for $40, which includes the annual pass as well as forsaken. [You can get it here.](https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/destiny2-forsaken-legendary-collection)
---
It's a D1 weapon, since it's present in D1
---
Skolas, atheon, golgoroth, ghaul, omnigul, and aksis, and maybe silok
---
Go through the initial game first, and if you like what you see up until forsaken then yeah definitely get it.
---
Technically it’s one season pass but you can buy which things you want out of it
---
Coupla years, I'd say
---
I am in the exact same boat, except I stuck around a bit longer. Got about halfway through the Curse of Osiris campaign, and dropped it. I did pick it back up after Forsaken came out, and finished CoO, Warmind and the Forsaken campaigns, but I just stopped playing it again. I want to get back into it so I can participate in the Season of Opulence, because I want to be ready for this expansion. Still haven't completed any raids except for Leviathan on normal.
---
recreate the bridge scene from thor ragnarok though

Can I get one irl plz?

Destiny 2: 2 Dark 2 Below
---
Who’s looking forward to finisher moving Ghaul, I know I am
---
I feel stupid, but do i need to re-download the whole game via Steam (seems like yes :( ) and use my [battle.net](https://battle.net) login on D2's title screen to continue with my progress in game?
---
I hope they make a small change to it. For me its kinda fine its just getting used to it
---
u/vreddit_bot
---
Tbf I am a PvE player and I usually don't feel the nerfs too hard... I was never salty about the nerfs before... but yeah people forget quickly
---
potentialy but you can make do as long as 1 weapon is void doesnt matter what class you run, for me its one of the most effective boosters in game alongside luna
---
&gt;so its a free ~~toy~~ 7 cores
---
FTFY
---
Idk man have you tried the Menagerie yet? I am personally very hapoy of this season's content even with the small uncomfortable changes.
---
But people were pretending like D3 is already around the corner
---
Not sure how I feel about it I’d have to see it in action. I just hope it’s not something that does extra damage that may end up being required to do
---
Thanks... if you excuse me im going to disnantle eververse stuff to get this emote
---
This. This is amazing, and exactly what we need. Hope an update to the tab along these lines, if not identical, gets bundled in with Shadowkeep.
---
Right now you need forsaken.
---
Duck
---
THIS IS AMAZING
---
1. The seasons last 3 months, so getting 4 season passes means you are securing a year's worth of small content drops now instead of getting them a la cart.
---
2. They haven't fully ironed out the details of how the transfer works yet but they do have something where you can sign up for an email and they will let you know the process once they figure it out.
---
3. I'm kinda confused on this as well, it kinda sounds like a spark notes version of the year 1 content in a way. Hopefully they will give some more info on it throughout the summer and as we get closer to the release of Shadowkeep.
---
Hope this helps!
---
Oh I'm sure Mara and Eris will come to the SFM workshop in September. For...lore reasons.
---
And all the guns and armour (the main chase in the game) are reskins.
---
I mean yeah, you have 80 something years im guessing?
---
Whats the rush?
---
And there's plenty of new stuff with new abilities
---
They need someone to publish them, they were literally publishing themselves until now.
---
I just tried to find it on the psn store and youre right, there is no shadowkeep version that comes bundled with forsaken and the other content. I thought they would have a version similar to the one you get when you preorder google stadia. the 99,99 thing you are looking at has everything up until shadowkeep. I personally would just wait for now, im pretty sure prices of old content are going to change pretty soon
---
There's a quest to start opulence that gets you to 690. Max light is now 750.
---
I wish I could be as patient as you seem to be
---
I’m not getting tribalistic. I just believe Borderlands is the superior game in every way apart from customisation for character. Which is a fair point, Destiny has great customisation, its too bad most of the armour is reskins. 
---
But in regards to BL, The guns are better, the best stuff isn’t locked behind a  paywall. The story is much better. The writing is much better. Everything isn’t just a reskin either. 
---
Expansions were actually worth the price they charged, and not a shitty stream of reskins which costs £25. You also got the full DLC upon purchase and don’t have to wait weekly for it. 
---
They don’t nerf you in a SP game, you also feel very powerful in BL. Compared to D2 where you just constantly feel like you aren’t gaining power.
---
Our doors are always open.
---
Ho so I wasn't the only one? That's great.
---
Like what? They added one class in for each subset, which was probably already done before D2 released. 
---
The main chase of the game is Armour and guns, which happen to be 80% reskins.
---
IF YOURE BRINGING THINGS BACK TO LIFE CAYDE 6 SHOULD BE BROUGHT BACK TOO PLEASE THX  just saying. Even if it’s as an enemy like what if his charismatic ass was the raid boss and he talked to us like riven the whole time like shit that would be cool
---
Jake Peralta: "I got chills"

That’s fucking stupid if that’s the case.

Lol that's gotta suck

It's was 70 here in Ireland
---
😂😂😂😭😭👌👌 aneurysms incoming
---
Base game, Osiris and warmind will be entirely free for anyone, particularly new players on steam, will also be free on consoles, you'll only need to pay for forsaken and other DLC after, mainly for their story content, you should still be able to play the new regions Forsaken+ come with and some of their strikes and adventures etc, so it'll be only if you enjoy whats already being offered and you want more gritty and meaty stuff from that particular expansion, so you can pay specifically for Forsaken only if thats what you want, or you can get shadowkeep or whatever they offer the the future by itself, rather than having a bundle with stuff you don't want/ aren't interested in
---
TLDR: you'll have to buy forsaken if you want to play story missions etc, but you won't be forced to in order to appreciate new content or to play on their areas, you can skip forsaken and head right to Shadowkeep or pick up both if you want
---
Thanks for the explanation. Those cases of exclusivity really sucks. Reminded me of Tomb Raider getting out first on Xbox and then a whole year later on PS4. Had no idea Epic's store was such a bad platform, I'm relieved that destiny is going to Steam then.
---
“Autistic jötunn screeching”
---
Will they be bringing back the D1 skill tree system?
---
So who's the Bing of Destiny??
---
Okay thank you!
---
So this is going to be another Shadowkeep expansions and Shadowkeep "ultimate" edition with an annual pass?
---
are your the speaker in disguise?
---
Never played any borderlands so I'll stick with what I got
---
You sire, are making my day
---
wallpaper engine is the bomb for sweet wallpapers
---
I fucking love this game
---
Same here.
---
Last night I played two hours of strikes with runefinder active. Nada.
---
So much for the wasted shards.
---
Yes, Shadowkeep will be like Forsaken as it being a seperat dlc that will be bundled with an annual pass for the "deluxe edition"
---
Buy it from in game Director
---
You won't get the current annual pass if you pre-order shadowkeep (at least I don't think you will), but you will get access to season of the undying if you pre-order the base shadowkeep keep instead of the deluxe.
---
As for your second question, I'm not much of a help because I play on console, hopefully somebody else can answer that for you
---
Ty
---
Most likely bugged, as the tribute hall hasn't even been released yet I don't think
---
It would be enough to remember the sorting choice you made. I always want the newest first. Having to click it every time is tedious.
---
i don’t understand the comparison people keep making between destiny and borderlands. borderlands is like, a game where you play through the story whereas i would say the campaign is the least important thing in destiny. can anyone enlighten me on why these 2 always get compared, besides having loot i guess?
---
also it’s subjective, but i think destiny’s story and even writing is better than borderlands. but obvs only my opinion :)
---
Calus: Am I a joke to you?
---
Soooo.... How you feelin' about all this after the Shadowkeep reveal, bud?
---
With the new f2p structure you would still need to buy everything from forsaken to the current season. This will be available to buy a la carte on September 17.
---
Currently if you wanted to catch up today, you’d buy the complete collection which contains base game, coo, wm, forsaken, and the 3 seasons in the annual pass. 
---
But again, when the game goes f2p, you’d just need to buy everything after forsaken, but you DO NOT NEED TO BUY THE CONTENT TO PLAY SHADOWKEEP. You can skip all of that if you want to. You can also pick and choose which seasons you want. 
---
If black armory doesn’t interest you, don’t buy season of the forge in September.
---
Great game. Enjoy!
---
I dont think destiny is bigger or better than borderlands, just more recent
---
Excuse me?
---
Well then I was an idiot
---
ArcLock? It's really improved since they buffed it. I use it almost exclusively now.
---
Thanks
---
*loads handcannon*
---
Moons haunted
---
Who dis?? The guy who cries over video games??
---
this is exactly what I predicted (tho anthem was garbage so it kinda boosted destiny 2 popularity) but it goes steam and going f2p is just showing game is underperforming and need that steam boost.
---
and making standalone expansions like shadowkeep is just showing that Bungie was behind the microtransactions as much or even more than Activision.
---
Dont think they could do that if they wanted to, the entire community would be pissed if what we all had to pay for all of a sudden was given out for free.
---
It looks like the game will not be going free to play until September. 
---
Major missed opportunity not releasing the f2p content a bit before to give new players time to learn the game.
---
Already preordered it. 
---
I trust Bungie to deliver quality.
---
Alright,but if you have the DLC,can you just use the cross save from the launcher to steam,and if i can,would i keep the DLC?
---
It is definitely used to mock the poor quality of a subject and it originated from an 80’s movie, Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo.   Sunny was referencing that movie title when they used it, as have multiple other shows and various media.
---
Can I ask how you acquired these photos of me watching the vidoc?
---
Please post a link or better picture.

I thought it was glen

It’s a screenshot from the vidoc. You can’t get a better picture

“Bungie has made D2 free to play because they have been bleeding players since release.

Okay.

Skips are also surprisingly effective in pve
---
Reminds me of when the launcher thing on Mercury was bugged and would murder anyone playing above 60 FPS. Good times

Bungie is just after next naive wave. That's how scam business works.
---
And sadly that's what we are now, trash clearers. Hopefully they'll buff Thundercrash in the future to be a real damage dealer like Nova or Blade Barrage
---
That is in fall, just before the new expansion, Sept sometime.  Right now you can buy it all on [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) for $40, and they will migrate you over to steam in Sept.

Well, you're 100% wrong, but you can take as long as you need to realize it.
---
I enjoy using bows in Gambit and may very well get the “Hush” without any special effort.   If your team is super eager to pick up motes then you can sit way back and dome monsters with ease.   Let your pack of blueberries pick up your motes for you
---
From a creative standpoint, they are absolutely thriving
---
What would destiny be without a pack of blueberries?
---
I wouldn’t hate the new pursuits tab location if it had a hot key
---
Yes

Also I was being sarcastic.

---
I'd love to be able to shade all items
---
yeah that's basically what i meant to say except for the collectors edition part. sorry if i worded it poorly
---
Forsaken and annual pass content is not included in Shadowkeep.  Destiny base game, year 1 dlcs and Shadowkeep.   
---
Unless the pre order version has the complete collection or something similar which would cost £80-£100.
---
Buy what you want to buy, we’re strangers we don’t know what you like.
---
It’s possible to preview non shadeable items by just previewing a certain shader 😓
---
Hi, guy who hasn't played this in a while. Can someone explain what I'm looking at ? All I got was Eris being Creepy, I think I saw Ghaul and one of the Barons, and I heard Omnigul's shrieking .
---
Isn‘t it Maradona?
---
I’ve be playing gambit non stop since Tuesday lol. So. Much. Gambit. 
---
I used my hunter and ran le monarque with Oathkeepers. Sometimes I would’ve use trinity ghoul since the electricity would count as bow kills. Honestly I just went for kills and did not really worry about during with motes or winning (sucked for my team lol) 
---
I didn’t really try to invade (only time I did was when I was trying to get the medals) just went straight for the ads. 
---
Also, the medals don’t have to be bow medals- they can be any kind so once your kills are done feel free to switch your load out. You get more progress for the harder to get medals than the simple ones like first to block.
---
Yea thundercrash is crazy
---
Nope.  EGS exclusives do not exist to me.
---
Also I have checked with destiny 2 support and they are telling me that the shadowkeep deluxe edition contains all season passes excluding the one for forsaken.
---
#TOOO WWARRRRRR!
---
I mean with new light coming is it worth it?
---
Nevermind. I saw a few messages about it. Sorry if it seemed aggressive
---
Didn't meant too
---
New light is year one. Opulence is great, I love this game and suggest to anyone who likes this game to get it. But like I said, I don’t know you, I don’t know what you like. Make a grown up choice.
---
Ubisoft is far from perfect, but their post-launch support is becoming the gold standard.  Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon: Wildlands, Division 1 and 2.....pretty noteworthy support.
---
They are like the opposite of the Bioware/EA of today.  Bioware just drops half baked stillborn disasters then gets mad at it's playerbase for it.
---
Syndicate, origins, and odyssey are all great. Origins and odyssey are honestly so similar though that odyssey is kind of a waste of money if you already have origins
---
It only ever made me feel shitty that I'm getting more than folks on other platforms, not special.
---
HERESY
---
It sure looks like Maradona.
---
I understand what you’re saying can be similar doing different missions bounties in the same areas.  The reason the game is played is getting that little bit further, getting that weapon to increase power light or the material to craft a weapon.  What makes it impressive is everyone has different paths to get to what they want.  Playing story, quests, gambit, crucible or vanguard knowing more content is coming is what hooks players in imo.
---
They are not doing the "annual pass" anymore. It is now a seasonal pass. the deluxe includes 4 "season passes" that includes shadowkeep and 3 additional passes that would cover you for the year. Bungie is letting you buy the season passes separately  or  if you're like me and know you are going to play all year you can buy the next 4 seasons all at once
---
No....
---
In my personal opinion my favorite exotics:   
---
\- Thunderlord (For Ad Clear/DPS)  
---
\- Sleeper Simulant (For Damage Output)  
---
\- Outbreak Perfected (DPS)  
---
\- One Thousand Voices (If you raid Last Wish, definitely worth the grind for DPS)
---
\- The Black Armory exotics are up for debate.
---
Izanagi's Burden is cool if you want high-caliber sniper w/ lots of damage  
---
Jotunn is a trolling weapon in Gambit and the Crucible. But is also great in certain PvE situations.   
---
Le Monarque is only for those that like bows with a poisonous kick.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
This season, Season of Opulence, the exotics are definitely exciting.   
---
 \- Truth, the rocket launcher from D1 is making a return to ALL players, whether you own the Annual Pass or not.   
---
\- Lumina (I believe that is its name), an exotic hand cannon, is making its way to Annual Pass owners.
---
Subtle calamity with archers tempo and rampage with a 10 accuracy masterwork.
---
Here is the "Deluxe" Shadowkeep package. The description indicates that this bundle includes "4 season passes" (A.K.A. Year 3 Annual Pass).
---
So I have no idea what you are looking at, but they both do not contain the Annual Pass.
---
Contradicting yourself a bit there, huh? 
---
Anyway, the Dutch store is confusing af. Nowhere does the digital deluxe edition mention anything about 4 season passes. The description of the normal edition does mention that there's 1 season pass included, the one for shadowkeep i presume. Just want to make sure that i'm ensured to get everything from season 8-11 when ~~buying~~ pre-ordering the digital deluxe edition.
---
Slap on Anteus Wards? I mean you didn’t have time to slide but next time...?
---
His face is like the moment when he realize he is gay xD
---
Ooooooh, thank you!
---
Every single piece was either from older content in Destiny 2, or some stuff from Destiny 1.
---
Trinity ghoul. It allows for fast ad clear, while also making some progress on medals because of the killmonger type medals.
---
Yeah what you saw everyone on twitch struggling with was the newest raid the Crown of Sorrows. I think you were either doing public events or strikes, both are really easy, raids are a different kind of monster. You can find the year 1 raids and the newest one off of the Nessus map on the leviathan, and you can find the last wish raid in the dreaming city, and the scourge of the past should be in the edz
---
Probably amazing tbh
---
I mean if you think about it that’d be awesome. Saint-14 was the super guardian of their time and we are the super guardian of our time. Maybe we make the ultimate decision to kill both the dark and the light, which would leave the hive in chaos as their darkness gods they pray to are gone. Our guardian dies and later a new one arises.
---
That’s false
---
Doxed
---
beutiful
---
Yea it is
---
Oh geez thanks
---
he has revoker in guardian
---
I’d be looking forward to that so much. And you’d still have access to all of the d2 content and gear. Not looking forward to having to start from scratch if a new game does come around
---
Ah so it’s not just me
---
Jotunn has become the main exotic I use, and Blast Furnace with a good roll is my favorite for Crucible (I'm a PvE player so I need all the help I can get in PvP). Also, Hammerhead is a must have for a Legendary Heavy and it owns in pretty much every activity.
---
If you like bows, Le Monarque is boss. 
---
All of those are from the Forges, and there's others from there that other people like that just don't fit my playstyle like the BA sniper. Best thing about these is you can grind until you get the weapon(s) you want with the random roll you like.
---
I'm having trouble thinking of any others off the top of my head, but the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/8ji06r/official_faq_please_read_before_posting/) has a list of the current meta that should fill in the blanks.
---
Did you mean to say far? If you did how so? PvP only. Not PvE
---
Where’s rhinos launcher?
---
I’m sorry to inform you, but they are green.
---
Lost sectors have specific weapon drops: [ilrathCXV's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9oiuxt/wanted_lost_sector_bosses_have_specific_loot_drops/?st=jwme8c5p&amp;sh=7d5cf2c2)
---
Are you a base game player, just Forsaken, or Forsaken+Annual Pass?
---
Lol it’s like the most popular meme on this sub rn
---
That comment says a lot about you.
---
Based on what I'm hearing, it is the best PVP sniper.
---
In PvP there are snipers that are much better. The only thing good about the sniper is it’s low zoom scope and that’s about it. Nothing is really “pinnacle” about it. A pinnacle weapon should reward you on hitting your shots not when you miss.
---
Other than to pair with exotic hand cannons there's no reason for it to be energy. Recluse, Lunas howl, Not forgotten, any other legendary energy hand cannon can be paired with it. I'm so happy itd kinetic tbh. Makes it way better
---
They went over some of the details in [this livestream](https://youtu.be/S0wVt0cnDTg?t=900) from yesterday. Datto asked them some questions that I think align with what your asking.
---
What makes it the best?
---
Bump!
---
This is what helped me
---
And the max range and the unique perk. Comes in handy a lot. Let's not pretend you got 90% of all your shots. It will help you out a lot. What else would be better? Maybe opening shot and that's it.
---
Can't? Lol... It's the responsibility of all youth to complain and object to things they don't understand.
---
Are you not gonna tell us the joke?
---
How were we supposed to put that together without your comment
---
you need 3500 comp points in total as u/Kyozakii pointed out, so you can get the sniper without even going to a high rank
---
I have a feeling Activision is not concerned with "morality" or anything other than profitability.
---
Will try that now
---
Me too yesterday!  I thought, who hurt you?  Why?  Isn't most other supers more fun to kill with?  But I got killed almost everytime by it so if it works keep doing it.  I can't blame them.  BUT  I will not join them!  that and I got my weekly done so no more crucible this week.
---
Event items go away once the events over m8
---
I'm a base game player, too broke to buy forsaken or anual 😭
---
I mean they are ok wouldn't say great the true sight is cool
---
I guess. It's gonna be hard for people to want to transfer from console if they'll have to shell out another roughly 60-70 bucks for forsaken+shadowkeep
---
Houndish has the most annoying voice on youtube dont @ me
---
Thanks for the help, I very much appreciate it all!
---
Well youre screwed lmao
---
Yea
---
For anyone hoping to farm some wins, hmu
---
If you have any more questions feel free to message me, tbh I don't know everything about the editions. But I've been there as new editions come out so I'm willing to help!
---
TLW is the best weapon to pair with a sniper, but that’s a kinetic.
---
I personally am not a big fan of recluse in PvP and I tried NF + aachen and it wasn’t a nice experience.
---
appears to only work under void
---
I would just buy it from whichever service you previously purchased it from and save yourself the headache.
---
Max range, best scope in game, free ammo when you miss, snapshot. I dont understand people who say it isnt. What does it not have that others do, maybe opening shot? That would be nice but that's the only useful perk I can think of that's actually good.
---
Low zoom, aggressive frame, its perk
---
How are you not a fan of recluse in pvp lol...
---
. Idk maybe diff tastes. Recluse destroys in pvp
---
Max range isn’t needed on a sniper especially. a aggressive frame sniper. They have the lowest of handling and it could use more. And I know I thought hit majority of my shots. But I’m good enough at sniping that Revoker is useless for me. And there’s many things they could of added as perk for example. Getting a kill increases the next shot precision damage until fired. This would be good for taking out supers.
---
A long long time ago, in a decade far far away (think original Starcraft, Diablo 1 &amp; 2, first years of WOW). For a while there I had deep respect for bliz, then they just seemed to implode a bit.
---
I don't know, which is why I said "Based on what I'm hearing,"
---
I've seen nothing but positive opinions on this sniper.
---
shut up dweeb
---
You do realize how range works right.... it increases bullet magnetism which basically makes people's hitboxes bigger. So yea range is important lol..
---
regional pricing from steam saves me a lot of money than the wallet stabbing bungie store
---
I’m just not a big fan of SMG’s in PvP
---
Ik how range works lol. And to me handling is more important
---
I concur. Am around 5000 hrs for the two games and there's no sign of slowing down. (Bear in mind I'm a middle aged man with life/family responsibilities, I'm not doing too bad ;) )
---
Oh yeah.
---
So I guess it's just Forsaken and the Annual Pass combined.
---
acktchually. . . 
---
as of the stream yesterday sony has agreed to cross save as well. Apparently they only agreed to it two days ago. I think Bungie put some pressure on them by leaking the cross save info early.
---
You can buy a console price pc (around 500$ and can run D2. That’s what I used to play on
---
We need to keep the Datto meme format
---
I rather have downtime once in a while than play D2 on console again
---
Hey I just want to say - no.
---
He's not coming back.
---
Abandon this idea.
---
Stop posting about this idea.
---
Stop thinking this idea.
---
Thanks.
---
Eros finds all these “dead” characters. Alive. She is also stroking a rooster feather. Just saying....
---
R6 mg
---
I think cross play is coming with new light so you would get D2 for free
---
Except they added pay to open loot boxes last year and haven't looked back on putting the best skins in them so you need to spend $40 to get them all if you're not lucky enough
---
Better off moving forward.
---
if you own it on [battle.net](https://battle.net) then it will all transfer over. from ps4 or xbox only the saves transfer, not licenses.
---
What about PVP? I think that would be a huge issue unless there were PVP barriers.
---
It’s not on the steam store bud
---
Dang that’s disappointing, I definitely would’ve switched if it did
---
But the original goblins crit is in its white box right?
---
you pulled a datto. he did the same thing on the stream yesterday
---
yes.
---
It’s the weapon manufacturer “Cassoid “ logo.
---
Forsaken and the annual pass. Curse of Osiris and warmind
---
It's cross save. The stuff they get on PC will always be available to them on any console.  Just ask them to play with you every once in a while.
---
Cassoid foundry logo.
---
that's not till september
---
Still overpriced DLCs.
---
Hell yeah!
---
I don't get it. 
---
Is this a question? Are you showing us the catalyst? Are you trying to tell us that your owner is injured and needs help?
---
USE YOUR WORDS LASSIE!
---
Yes. Idk if has been datamined like everything else. But I'm hoping it makes the overpowered shot with 2 less bullets.
---
Easy for you, I guess. I'm honestly ambivalent towards the platform, so I'll be purchasing it on PC regardless.
---
Are they making Improvements? I saw an earlier post that they nerfed all the good exotics to shit
---
what’s the confusion?
---
Try soloing a nightfall for the multi kills
---
That just sounds terrible. I don't know anyone (other than you OP) that wants more old content in old areas instead of new fresh content.
---
reminds me of the spider-man presentation format, the Lisa Simpson format, the- hold on.
---
This is my favourite GIF now...
---
i don’t feel misled at all, it’s the beginning of a new year. New dlc means a new purchase, at least to me...
---
...except it happened in direct encouragement from Bungie releasing a quest involving Bow use in Gambit.
---
Let me help you out pal:
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3IGWCgot5ko
---
Didnt they confirm ps4 in the stream
---
The desire one is green, right? I still need to unlock them
---
I hold firm to my belief that he’s doing shit behind vanguard’s back.
---
Yes. Part of the prerequisite for the season of opulence intro is to have completed forsaken.
---
i think you never even played a non consumer friendly game did you? you buy the game and have access to all heroes, all your characters are unlocked, you can play all the maps, you play on a fiar playing field and no one can buy extra damage packs or xp booster... this is really consumer friendly compared to the other shit... only thing more friendly to consumers is probably warframe.
---
Or /r/fireteams
---
Thanks. Tried searching for it.
---
I literally just tried that this morning and it wouldn't let me.
---
I mean it has to be rather fast so firing all 6 shots doesn't sound that good,however a quick double tap can work imo
---
THROW PURPLE SHIELD MORE LIKE PUNCH THAN HAMMER BECAUSE PURPLE

Idk, the time it takes to get it may not be worth it. I could be wrong so I'd ask someone else to be sure.

TITAN PUNCH PUNCH HUNTER THAT TRIED PUNCH TITAN PUNCH WITH PUNCH PUNCH
---
Well that would be the point of Bungie having the game officially on Steam wouldn't it?
---
Ok ty
---
That makes me so happy :)
---
Thanks for the good news
---
What
---
Well, I had the base game and from the battle net launcher I had to option to buy the bundle of just forsaken + annual pass including the year 1 expansions. If I searched for the bundle in a browser it wouldnt show, just from the battle net launcher
---
It’s a slow discard I wonder if it’ll be any use later 🤔
---
Me: HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO TEACH THIS LESSON TO YOU A\*\*HOLES?!?! STOP COMING BACK TO LIFE OR WE'LL JUST KEEP KILLING YOU!!!! \*Readies all my weapons in preparations to kill the resurrected enemies once more\*
---
We don't know all the details about transferring saves. I suggest looking [here](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/PCMove) and signing up to get the information about this when it comes out.
---
Yeah they’re green
---
wait for honor was free for a time? dangit :(
---
You have only you to blame if this happens "every single time".
---
As stated in another comment, https://www.bungie.net/7/en/PCMove here is all the info so far, you can sign up for updates. Not much has been revealed and there is no reason to panic right now
---
Lol
---
I genuinely hate blade barrage more than tether. 
---
With tether you can get a one shot super off before it actually shuts it down
---
Blade barrage is just instant death no matter what and you cant see it coming.
---
Does the car dealer sell you a beta version of the car for the full price then gets you to test it for two yeast to get in in a good state then gives it for free to someone else? Yea that was d2 vanila. You tend to shape reality as you seem fit
---
PSS: That isn’t how ever verse works. They’re going F2P and the silver is merely a buy now option. Everything will be available for bright dust throughout the season.
---
Please do some research before ranting about stuff.
---
Balancing the sandbox doesn’t mean they don’t listen to fans.
---
Lord of wolves outclassed other shotties by too much. All they did was lower the margin.
---
Whisper outclassed every other heavy because it’s infinite ammo.
---
Super regen exotics outclassed other exotics and made no reason to run them.
---
? Idk
---
YO, bungie don't come here man. They'll never see this. Check the disclaimer (rule #1 of this sub), and while you're at it take a peek at the other sub rules ;)
---
You got a Tribute Hall triumph? Huh, wonder why that triumph is related to there instead of Menagerie
---
Thanks really helpful..!
---
&gt; You tend to shape reality as you seem fit
---
&gt; Does the car dealer sell you a beta version of the car for the full price
---
And you don't Get real. Destiny 2 wasn't all that exciting in year 1 but to call it a beta is just ignorant. I won't be responding to this comment chain further.
---
*loads finisher*
---
YEEET
---
Where is this meme from lol
---
Just thought of a third motive after seeing this: Maybe he's bringing them back to help us prepare for someone like Savathûn or Xivu Arath, as by the Sword Logic we'll get stronger by killing all of these manifestations of our enemies, which I assume will be as strong as/stronger than before.
---
So maybe have two other players run it while I jump and die in the background, would that work?
---
Borderlands 2 and the division 2 are great games and imo destiny 2 is up there.  With gameplay been repetitive I agree but I haven’t seen a looter shooter yet which isn’t similar throughout the game.  Cosmetic wise micro transactions aren’t great but how many games are now using this model.  As along the gameplay is the same and isn’t pay to win I see it as which we can choose to pay or not.
---
Yeah one friend said they thought going ftp was gonna add tons of microtransactions but I pointed out. If Activision could only get them to do eververse I would be shocked if moving away from Activision makes them start. It would be the biggest fall from Grace ever. Then he said "oh yeah I forgot they split. NVM were probably fine. "
---
One *hell* of a firing squad :P
---
You will probably have to pay for the Forsaken expansion once the game is actually out on Steam
---
Remember when people were asking Bungie to add the D1 raids to D2?  Well this appears to be the manifestation of that.
---
Thank you I didn't notice that. If this is the case I would most definitely be interested in coming back to Destiny. Been playing since beta D1 and have loved the games despite their flaws. But honestly just got tired of feeling like all the work I was putting in was for nothing come next expansion. This would make me very happy to see. ❤️
---
If I understand it correctly, you'll need to purchase the Forsaken DLC if you want to experience that campaign but as a free user you'd still be able to travel to the locations introduced in Forsaken.
---
You have to also realize people paid good money for the content that was supposed to last over the course of winter 2018- Summer 2019, and making it free shortly after the last content piece dropped wouldn't be fair to the people who have already invested money into your game.
---
What is it with people all of a sudden not knowing the difference between ‘then’ and ‘than’? I swear this is a new phenomenon that has only popped up within the last year or so. 
---
So painful to read.
---
so instead of balancing what is weak they nerfed what is strong? Making a fun to use weapon nearly a useless pice of crap. They have been doing it since Destiny 1. OH wow we have 200 shitty guns and 5 good ones, let's nerf them, not slightly tune them, not asking fans or making a test build for the players to react to nerfs, they throw an update every 4 monts or so and we have to deal with it. Yay!
---
You had fun grinding day in day out just for that legendary to turn to a rare? You had fun grind strikes and shit for the chance to get the materials to unlock the perks on your gun or armor? You had fun knowing doing the raid was your only way to actually progress and with people being highly picky on who gets into the team? Gameplay itself was fun but dont lie that at the very core of early d1 it was just shit. It wasnt till taken king that things started going good and only when the old raids were revamped that it was truly this magnificent game that alot of people played.
---
Same way you got stronger in the base game so powerful stuff what are these questions
---
$30 regular $60 Digital Deluxe
---
100% outbreak prime, can easily one phase
---
Been playing since day one. Destiny has been nothing but amazing. Met amazing people and the most amazing friends because of this game. When D2 came out, damn was I disappointed. All my friends stopped playing and it was the end if it. Recently I grabbed forsaken and my god.... it is awesome! Feels slightly like D1 but has it's own personality. LOVE IT. Cant wait for the new DLC
---
Would have*
---
That giant hive fortress looks pretty good tho
---
Yup.
---
I'm preorder Shadowkeep. I don't care if it shit. I'm still going to play it.
---
Used LfG. Found a group after like 2 hours of rage-filled parties. Finally at 8am me and 5 others just worked real hard and used genuine understanding and compromise to overcome our egos and beat it after 3 hours. Was quite fucking impressive tbh. And oh yeh... it dropped the exotic AND a raid shotty with small ore, assault mag, pulse monitor, surrounded and range MW. Thanks for a fucking awesome experience bungie!
---
Extremely true, Activision never pushed for microtransactions to be so prevalent. Now, Destiny is going free to play. Sounds like they want some of the massive troves whales feed to F2P games.
---
I doubt it as toland became more selfish the more he learned about the hive. If anything i think he bri gs them back to level them up through sword logic to then consume to fight or dethrone savanthun. But then again this is all based on the chance toland is actually involved and those shadows could be the darkness race since they look really similar to the concept art of the darkness.  https://m.imgur.com/gallery/85Ybp
---
I think the PC has more potential, but it's just not viable for everyone to spend $1000 on a PC.  I played on ps4 for a long time and definitely had a lot of good times :)
---
Your*
---
Fuck auto correct and my Polish brain
---
It was magical. Exotics were and felt exotic, even Legendaries felt earned. Xur was a hypebeast.
---
True, but I feel like with Eris back Toland may have a heavy involvement here, although we can't really say for certain
---
Shadowkeep is revamped old content. If they include all the original tunnels and whatnot underneath the moon and expand that x2, then sure I'll see it as new. Still recycled content though, I still have D1 downloaded and can just go play that game.
---
 
---
Hilariously enough I can be at the Hellmouth with Monte Carlo and Peregrines in both games. Sounds pretty recycled to me.
---
As do I, however literally every person I know who played Origins says Odyssey is a waste of money, I never actually played Origins but from what I’ve been told the games are nearly identical
---
Lol whys that?
---
Like i said gameply was the only good thing during that time everything else felt like a chore to do. And legendaries only felt earned because you were either guranteed them in the raid or you grinded 30 emgrams with only a third being legendary.
---
I feel eris herself is hiding some pretty serious stuff just like mara.
---
If you point this out people will hate you. It's best to let them think Bungie is making it better for them.
---
I do miss my Facets though, and I especially miss the seasonal engram.
---
Activision already has been losing profit these past couple years and their stocks are seriously declining. They simply aren’t listening to the consumers, they’re choosing quick, low effort cash injections rather than planning for long term profit, they’d rather make a million dollars today than five million over the next year
---
I agree with you bro destiny at it’s core was pretty ass at that point but i’m just saying that because I always had my group of six to go through it all with it was good times for me, personally :)
---
Oh yeah it looks awesome. Initially would have guessed that the raid would take place in there but that's a whole other thing plus we go to the black garden again so it's a win win to me. I hope the tower is like a "fight your way to the top" sort of thing
---

Prime is so much quicker for me imo I usually run it with my clan and have the actual roles in place

Ok, that is good! There were maybe 20 or so questions in this subreddit earlier from people who owned the annual pass but had somehow never finished Forsaken before, so I thought it was worth mentioning just in case.

Yup, I made a post about this and people just don't want to hear it. A year ago people hated the Eververse and it gave you everything if you played an average amount. Now people love it and you literally can't earn anything without paying 100k+ bright dust. Someone literally did all the math, and I can paste it here, but it's literally impossible to aquire the bright dust required to purchase even half of the new stock.

Just sounds like time to bail on the game. Black Desert Online, Elder Scrolls Online, these are games I don't play because they have an ingame market with such a presence. You can't earn any of that currency in game, so you just see all this new flashy U.I designed to make you want these items. Yet they cost more real money, oof.

Is there a source on this? It's too good
