and you get fucking hardlight

---
exotic engrams are so rare, that you'll probably collect all the exotics before your 5th drop since you started playing the game.
---
Yes, taking a break from the summer to play the new dlc
---
I got 4 shinubos vow or whatever 4 times in a row. I was pissed.
---
Hey am I banned from the sub? I tried posting a pic and it didn‚Äôt show up.
---
All 6 people use prospector. One melting point, a well with lunafaction boots, and a few celestial nighthawk.
---
I don't want them to use them, I want them to have them
---
Cluster bombs work exactly like they did before. Now, however, grenade launchers are a better option because they were buffed.
---
The game somehow tracks your activity level, so if you're playing on a daily basis it will be less likely that you'd get a drop, that's why it's always good to take a break.
---

---
I've tried it and it  works.
---
r/holdmymolly
---
Thank you!
---
How many had to die for his happiness tho?
---
Gotta get those solar kills for redrix somehow. At least I'm not aping with NF and a dust rock.
---
I wanna see his face he realizes the exotic he gets is nerfed to hell.
---
Bro lost his mind
---
Literally nothing changed. My personal go-to is The Prospector. One of the highest DPS in the game, explodes on impact, Riven practically kills herself.
---
Got an exotic engram drop while I was on my 3rd attempt at zero hour earlier this week. I wasn't able to pick it up before we beat it. So I got Outbreak Perfected, went to the postmaster expecting to get a year 1 exotic. I got Arbalest instead.
---
Time that restart üòé 
---
Rumble is the best practice too, imo
---
Strong 12/10
---
RELAX GUARDIAN YOU'RE SCARING THEM HAHA!
---
Oh thanks for the heads up
---
Np. I suggest using r/Fireteams if you wanna use reddit, otherwise just use the companion app
---
no worries, and thank you. as far as emotes, i'll go for the new hug emote and see how that goes ha!
---
God damn it, what about us addicts!?  A week of hell so that I can finally get exotics to drop???

Thousand years of pain- make Kakashi proud

I have about 1000+ hours on D2 - Just the thought of grinding it all seems daunting üòÇ
---
Novelty is a hellova drug.
---
I agree with you there. I didn't necessarily mean apeing with a NF, but just going super sweaty. Jotunn requires no skill to use and no skill to counter, it's very good if you already have an advantage though. I'm just using it because I needed solar kills for my redrix, and I hate using Luna's since I'm so used to 150's
---
I‚Äôve been stuck on connection strength for 3 days lmao
---
That first part is true, but isn't the note Cayde writes to himself? I thought it was like a half-narcissistic joke sort of thing, not addressed to the Drifter. I could be wrong though.
---
I‚Äôd guess redrix‚Äôs, jotunn, and Zenobia or any other tracking module rocket. Pair with a nova bomb + skull. Maybe not skull after nerfs, but just a guess
---
I recently returned to D2 since finishing forsaken. I have played for a month and got one exotic to drop.  It was a dup.
---
It might be just helmets because I‚Äôve seen Xur selling gauntlets that I had in my inventory with a different role
---
People like OP make the community a better place. :D
---
If you don't have prospector (like me), the green grenade launcher Penumbra GSm works just as well.
---
Everytime xur sells a gauntlet it always rolled with impact induction, fusion reloader, hand cannon reloader, machine gun and sniper scav. The armor that comes from his engram can roll randomly.
---
You literally need a .5 efficiency and above... Assists count noob
---
Well uh, it's still there.
---
I have an arsenic bite with archer's tempo/rampage and a draw time masterwork. I absolutely love that thing in PvP. If i have cover to dip in and out of, i can 2 tap even without rampage active. It basically one taps with it.
---
And then you get a duplicate exotic or a weapon you already have.
---

---
So you‚Äôre one of those guys in crucible huh? üôÑ-.- lol jk jk nice video man!
---
Probably just lag. If your opponents damage registers after the kill it would stop the shield.
---
Haven't ever done SOS is the fusion rifle worth going for?
---
something like that, yes.
---
Okay cool, thanks!
---
haha yes, just LEDs xD
---
Thx a lot! Wasn't expecting much feedback at all, I'll start after the new season launched. Think I'll go with my warlock/emp rift/monarque, heal some teammates, stay back, leave heavy for the team if possible. DIMed a sweet loadout already. I'm actually curious now if I will get that commitment not to give up. Thanks for your help! Appreciate that a lot!

---
If you kill yourself right before placing the rally flag, this will happen. Had nothing to do with your golden gun. Sorry OP.
---
*Do I actually have to be on my warlock then buy the FE to get one of the missing forsaken exotics?*
---
This seems pretty straightforward to me. Why would you get a Warlock exotic if you buy it on your titan or hunter? And you can also not get the ones that are listed as 'unknown' or the ones that are part of a quest from Xur's engrams.
---
You need to be on the character that needs exotics when you buy the engram. If you need warlock exotics, you need to buy the engram with your warlock.
---
You need to be on the class which needs the missing exotics.
---
If your missing WARLOCK exotics you MUST but the engram with your WARLOCK to get the missing exotics. Same with any class.
---
If you can't do it, you don't deserve it.
---
That seem weird cuz my friend who started playing again two weeks ago after not playing since warmind  has recieved it a lot
---
I seriously dont rember this being a thing with year one Fated engrams. But I must be remembering wrong I guess.
---
Plus some good live music and lights on top of it all!
---
She's just that good a hacker, she needs to flip her keyboard to challenge herself.
---
You guys don‚Äôt get it. That‚Äôs not how you use jotunn. You precharge corners and release if you see someone about to run out. As soon as the guy turns the corner, he gets hit, and couldn‚Äôt do anything about it. And that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so frustrating to be on the receiving end against a good jotunn user.
---
Haven‚Äôt had an engram drop in so long but I did get a wardcliff and black talon from milestones.
---
I know how to use jotunn, but an erentil and a hunter Dodge will destroy it every day. If you use your radar and have game sense, it's really not hard to counter with anything that isn't a nerf gun.
---
I'm honestly not sure but it sure doesn't feel like it tbh
---
Enjoy your St0mp-EE5
---
Just do what myself and all other extraordinarily average PvP players did: wait until Mayhem comes up and Shards/BB everyone. You‚Äôll finish in like 3-5 games and probably have fun doing it.
---
I re input it just to be sure and it didnt work and i know it was correct
---
Destiny has change my life in many ways. For me, it's more than just a videogame.
---
No but u can prob buy it from GameStop and play it for the day and immediately return it. My friend did that with a AAA game and got a full refund.
---
I do the same with sentinel shield each time they stomp or boop me off. Feels so badass since my teammates expect me to die and I just casually bring myself back on the bridge like captain america.
---
The stormcaller coming in your bubble at 2:10 is the exact same one coming in at the next clip. How did they not learn their lesson? lol.
---
Can you do this all day?
---
Yeah that's true
---
Yeah story missions are not hard in Destiny. Maybe Forsaken made it a bit challenging with all the baron bosses.
---
They already remade the Ghaul boss fight for last year's summer event before. And he was much harder to beat.
---
&gt; bring up one of his successors to avenge him and actually make him hard to beat.
---
And this is exactly what happens in the spire of stars raid. Val Cauor is one of his successors and the final boss of the raid. He is probably the hardest boss in the game when you play prestige mode. Easily the most hated boss lol.
---
r/expectedthanos for balance

Holy shid didn't expect to break 500 or even 750 on my first Reddit post on the platform and on r/destiny2, Thank you

Not really the whole commentary gets drowned out and ruins the mood but if it was it the background more and didnt cover up the scene as much it would be better imo
---
I don't think it's the keys falling out thing, she does type on the keyboard several times throughout missions and Ana Bray remembers everything about who she was and her family before the collapse. So technically Ana should know how to use a keyboard. Setting that aside, I totally agree that resurrected space warriors from the future that can teleport in and out of lightspeed-traveling ships (but need a robot to open any and all doors for them, that part is more important for our purposes) would probably have a lot of trouble doing mundane tasks from the 21st century simply because they've become unnecessary skills. Again, that being said, the easiest way to tell which direction a keyboard is facing is with the most uniquely shaped key: the spacebar. Why is it the most (distinguishably) unique key? It's the biggest. And it's clearly at the top of this keyboard. SO:
---
Knowing that Ana almost certainly understands 21st century keyboards, and considering she occasionally types on them, I'd say this is just a dumb design bug/mistake. But a cool lore suggestion for it would be that whoever rebuilt it didn't know since it's technically "golden age information" like you said.
---
It‚Äôs the damage of a sniper bodyshot on a headshot, which is easier to land than a sniper bodyshot, and uses primary ammo. Bow headshot and clean up however you want.
---
They‚Äôre not OP by any means lmao, the draw time screws you very often because you shoot them, start the next arrow and that‚Äôs a full 700ms minimum that your opponent isn‚Äôt getting flinched. Plenty of time for most weapons to kill you. You have to play cover if you want to use them effectively, and they can be very effective, but you have to play very passive, to the point where enemies could just sort of ignore you if they want.
---
Basically, they‚Äôre not good aggressive weapons. They‚Äôre best for when your enemy has to come to you, so you can just play defensive
---
Hm, this doesn't make sense to me, although I don't mean to simply disagree with you. A precision HC kill with a void weapon in comp nets 4 points towards the 200 or 300 point total. That's over 1% per kill. I'm not great at the game, tbh, but I was able to net 8-10% per game, depending on the mode.
---
Meh, I simply don't remember this being that bad.
---
Can we get this stickied, please?
---
April fools
---
That would be me... I‚Äôve posted 3 or four over the last few days.
---
Lucky. Bastard.

Thats great news, but....ive done NUMEROUS pub events and bounties on that character. Ik not picking up samples anywhere.
---
We shit his ass down. Good thing you felt that way.
---
Yes Im an extremely lucky bastard lol
---
Hey cutie ;)
---
Haha amen
---
Not sure. Was on a 4 resilience warlock with the exotic raid sparrow equipped. Will try again on my titan later today.
---
Same here. Can't teat at the moment. Maybe someone can
---
Okay, maybe try dropping a well right at the door, or in the beginning, and using the well to boost your chances of survival haha
---
Mine is the classic outlaw/rampage with a stability masterwork and armor piercing rounds. I love that thing. Used it to get Luna's. 
---
Kill clip and rampage are usually good in PvP. Look for a range masterwork too. But like i said mine only has a stabily MW and it does just fine.
---
Im not gonna lie
---
Prolly not in d2 but in d3 they‚Äôll probably bring it back
---
Thats the Keyboard Bungie‚Äòs Devs designed Destiny 2 üòá
---
Tldw; give me karma
---
I see you‚Äôre a man of culture as well.
---
That depends... I agree with the other comment about reading up on it and deciding if it's worth it to you.
---
I would if it's on sale. Cool weapons like thorn and Last word. On PC they are some of the best PvP wise. Black armory was eh, but had a decent raid. Gambit prime isn't bad and has cool armor and weapons. And season of opulance is about to start with all kinds of new activities.
---
You're not the only one who feels this way.  
---
Hawkmoon in no way, shape or form can appear in D2 in it's D1 form.  It'll have to be an exemplary remake on the same level as Thunderlord, Ace, and all of the other returned exotics.  
---
But to have three **RANDOM** rounds in the mag that simply do extra damage?  That would be lackluster and Hawkmoon would pale in comparison to the Ace in every way.
---
This here, kids, this here is the reason you don't use bottom tree stormtrance in pvp ever.
---
What even is the point in karma
---
*Ana

If you‚Äôre going to mention Ana Bae at least get the name right you filthy casual

TIL you can use Sentinel block while jumping

thank you

I run dust rock and recluse in PvE and whatever heavy fits the element modifier so I‚Äôll upgrade those first I guess
---
What's with people playing with super good advice a lot lately?
---
I'm the opposite.  Best Bygones I've gotten is the vendor roll, Full Auto/Kill Clip and my Chattering Bone is the curated one from Riven, though if I'm honest I'd like to find one with Full Auto/Rampage and Light Mag.  I got really lucky with my Blast Furnace and got Feeding Frenzy/Kill Clip on the very first one.  Since then I've gotten 2 or 3 with Outlaw/Rampage.
---
SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND
---
If they do being it back they better revamp it pretty hard. It would be exciting to make actual choices outside of just goofing around. People quickly forget that there were only 2 or 3 solid builds in each sub tree very similar to the nodes we have now. If they do bring it back (which I would love, dont get me wrong) they're gonna need to give thought to making more Meaningful choices outside of a few key skills.
---
The same people on dtg are on here, dont let em fool you.
---
Theres a way where even if everyone but one person dies you can all get the flawless run.
---
  Make sure the survivor doesnt head to the chest once he beats the run. 
---
  Everyone else spawns and goes to the cave the winner would exit from and climb up to the *still unopened* chest. 
---
Once youre *all* up there make sure you guys gather up closely and then open chest at the same time.
---
Its how I got the triumph.
