There are functions built into the game  to take screenshots, you should try it some time.
---
---
---
You can avoid this easily by simply strafing, doesnt need nerfing at all
---
Not much? You wanna friend me so we can play together, Mr Not Much? Could use an invader with your modest skill.
---
But then how would I show off my awesome water bottle?
---

---
But thanks, I‚Äôll look it up.
---
yea screw you sir
---
Thanks!
---
Destiny 2 is like star wars but for cool people. Star wars sucks. 
---
Its so nice to just Nova Warp, then when the enemy panics and send Power weapon rockets or swords, whatever, i just warp through them, and kill the Panickers.
---
Go commit thinking emoji until brain explode.
---
Counterbalance 
---
Na, i think telesto is a nice tool for fieldcontrol and some alternative builds, but some kills are too much random at all ^^ 
---
This will be the new go-to if Queensbreaker ever gets nerfed. 
---
This is just destony all over.
---
1 class ha an op exotic that is so OP it's ridiculous.
---
Other 2 classes moan and moan and moan because *they* don't have their own op exotic
---
Its like my mate cries on discord "oh my fuckin god, there is a telesto shot at me ... BOOM"
---
OEM requires some skill to use but with skate abusing being a thing, they should either remove/adjust skating or give a crushing nerf to OEM just like they did with Wormhusk back when all titans whined about that one. Good times.
---
You're probably facing the same level 20's in IB as you are in comp.
---
They are. On the 29th.
---
UGH, that's the one scout I hate!
---
I mean, you'd think that should be obvious, right? I know I've used weapons matching the burn but then picked a different class subtype cause I wanted to try a new path but it's invariably when I'm running with my clan, so we match elements anyway. Again, this seems like a simple thing to me, so I'm confused why anyone doesn't get it done. 
---
That tether was a FULL SEND.
---
ok
---
Are you overclocking anything?
---
oh man that's such a sweet drop. i'd use it everywhere.
---
I still have nightmares about you knifed by you
---
Yep, sounds about right. At least you didn't have any motes on ya.
---
What hand Cannon is this?
---
No that's a seperate forge system for Curse of Osiris. Unlock all of them to get the Sagira Ghost shell.
---
It's a Napoleon Dynamite movie reference...
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xL-VX3WbA9U
---
Yep. Reach max level in Crucible (Legend/2000 points) and reset your rank. Ive been waiting patiently for weeks for the damn thing to drop, turned out I just had to press F for 3 seconds...
---
It says go to the lighthouse to forge prophecy weapon. Can I just go and get a weapon then? Lol sorry I'm trying to learn more about this stuff
---
Just go talk to the cult leader on Mercury.
---
For most games, you do need to pay money and while there are good F2P games like Warframe, it isn't like they don't get a good amount of money through micro-transactions and many other sources.
---
The more important question is, if it's worth for you and that is hard to say. Destiny 2 is currently at it's best and if you like a looter, well, you will like the full Destiny 2 experience.
---
No worries lol, the prophecy weapons are made from the tablets but you have to put some items in to them that you get from different activities. Vance will essentially guide you.
---
Ya boi greater dog flexxin
---
Haha I know, just being sarcastic. That happens so much, infuriating.
---
Oh...I'm stupid.
---
Wait what?
---
I think only at first glance. I find Anthem more comparable to the Borderlands and Diablo playerbase and basic course mechanics than Destiny. The fact that it also lacks pvp means people wouldn't be crossing over in droves. 
---
I can't comment on The Division 2 as I only watched the first trailer and haven't followed it's development. I also only played the first one for about an hour before I stopped playing (which had nothing to do with the game; I bought it to play with some friends at the time but then never did so I lost interest). 
---
I enjoyed d1 as well but quit before the big update. Played the Anthem alpha but it didn't show much, although flying was super fun. 
---
Hey man, whine and bitch away. It‚Äôs just hilarious that the least informed are the loudest complainers but don‚Äôt let that stop you. I like my memes with a side of salt
---
I don't know what kind of walls you're running into but I don't have these kinds of problems. 
---
Melting Point Titan + two Warlocks w/ Geo‚Äôs = insta-win. It‚Äôs ridiculously entertaining. I got on w/ a fireteam last weekend and we ran a 12 win streak with that formula  
---
My bad.
---
I do, all the time. Just flying forward, and then hit a wall I can't see and then off I go
---
I got the same one lol,but with rampage. Great in PvE and fun in PvP, two taps guardians woth one stack of rampage.
---
go to r/fireteams
---
I'm glad they're actually useful now. When d2 dropped they were pretty much useless. The meta was mida or nameless midnight, antiope d, uriels gift, and cluster rockets. Theres so much more you can use now. 
---
That's one of the most fun exotics I've gotten my hands on in a long time so I feel for your pain. 
---
Buff his health.
---
Just a quick question, why would you personally say that they should nerf PVE content based on the meta in PVP? And why should they have players who don‚Äôt enjoy PVP forced to play it? 
---
Yeah but then you make those round the fun ones. Grenade suicides. Shots during deaths. Teabag till they return and kill you. Let the world burn it's twenty minutes. Unless your going for gear in which case I admit your points are extremely valid and I realize my stupidity.
---
Oh I can feel that enemy teams salt when they lost.. big rip to them just missing the kill. 
---
Idk, that SMG does well in crucible. I have one, but wish j still had my 3 different burns I had before year 2 came around.
---
Fun fact, circle being "back" or "stop" is a western thing, 
---
  
---
In most easter games you might notice that circle takes the same role a X on western games. 
---
Cheers. Yours made way more sense to me 
---
What is up with hunters today? That's the second hunter today I've seen on this subreddit get flung faster then a Titanskating master.. are you all just upset still about losing blink and you're trying to recreate it?
---
Big Thungus
---
Do not pass go, do not collect 200 dollars.
---
"There's more"
---
-Spy
---
plot twist: their name actually means "Luna Showl"(moon/luna standing on their head laughing)
---
&gt;Because I use OEM, Synthceps or Dunemarchers. Getting an extra kill or two doesn‚Äôt out weigh increasing your gun play or neutral game. 
---
I guessed as much . What you really meant was "There is definitely a lack of OEM level PvP exotics for the Titan. Situational or Super boosting exotics have nothing on OEM".
---
&gt; Oh and you mentioned one exotic you didn‚Äôt list anything. 
---
Are you blind? I linked [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/ah1xwf/are_you_ready_for_the_crucible_guardian/eecsk27/) reply with 7 exotics.
---
I will agree that there are some good points; everyone had something to work on. 
---
The main issue I have with DTG is its 99% negative.  Which would be fine...if people could come up with something better to do.  But when the majority of threads are just people complaining about the game they continue to play then I have to consider their complaints to be nothing besides invalid.
---
Destiny 2 seems to be more about enjoying shooting aliens in the face/having fun
---
I got that minigun AR from crucible a few weeks ago. I hope I get lucky with this pulse rifle too
---
Thanks for the critique. You are right. I did use my phone and edit the pictures together because I was unaware of how to merge 6 photos together on my ps4. 
---
I'll make sure to pretend like I actually care that I can't make everyone on the internet happy. Maybe someday I will download the photos and transfer them to my PC so that I can edit and... oh wait, the more I type this the more I realize that I really don't give that much of a shit.  It was a reddit post. I'm not an editor for a magazine. Feel free to get off your high horse or take your opinion somewhere else where someone might value it. üëçüèª
---
Mobility is 8? Too low?
---
triggered
---
I gotta use before they nerf it next week
---
OMG this is definitely the best one so far
---
Hammerhead was out of ammo... Plus, I love it.
---
Best comment
---
You shared your opinion and then I shared mine. 
---
k
---
Bull should need range on hand cannons and shot guns
---
Well he beat Yor and his elites at the same time, I'm willing to bet he can take us out. 
---
You don't need to pocket the super, it's 83/47/19 seconds for grenades, base/hallow/hallow+super. It also affects you. It also affects your melee and barricade.  
---
Ofc there is a reason, getting a super to suppress then another one within 1 minute happens almost every game. Also don't mind that you can sometimes fail your suppression. Obviously just having two of normal grenades is good always, because grenades are a great tool in general.
---
&gt; Situational exotics are a waste of an exotic and super boosting is nice that 2-3 times you get one a game but are worthless the rest of the time. 
---
That's like your opinion, man.  
---
As far as super is concerned, I listed doomfang, which also works outside of super. 
---
i just think you know more about osiris than rasputin, which honestly depends on what you read ingame and in the previous game
---
rasputin was more or less teased in atleast one adventure on io 
---
it really depends on knowledge of destiny lore
---
And yes warmind has a pretty open ending but that doesn‚Äòt make the story of curse of osiris better 
---
i am in a clan as well and litterally nobody in it wants to even touch comp due to how absolutely sweaty people will and the amount of 4 stacks
---
That‚Äôs a great roll, doesn‚Äôt get any better than that. Make your own decisions as to which weapons you like. Personally I would not hesitate and MW it immediately because I really like the duke. 
---
It doesn't extend chaos reach but procs the arc conduction perk 
---
You are the enemy of the people
---
Vigilance wing was my first exotic.
---
The weird thing is we were planning it and you just happened to follow suit. Now rock that emblem!
---
Go read lore you fuckin warlock
---
That moment when you realize you can switch from Warlock to Titan for the not forgotten quest. 
---
320 is the recommended light. 
---
Scouts are getting buffed at the end of the month, when telesto and waveaplitter are getting nerfed
---
Midnight coup from leviathan raid
---
This is correct. PvP and PvE have separate metrics
---
What?
---
And then I was like wtf just happened
---
Totally fine solo. The only thing you‚Äôre locked out of are raids and nightfalls. Those you can just LFG for. 
---
Arc kills still recharge your abilities faster so quicker melee, grenade, and more supers. Still great for Chaos reach especially if you‚Äôre like me and can‚Äôt get geomags.
---
....lol bungie really nailed the physics in this game that's for sure 
---
Yup
---
*laughs in Titan*
---
Its on pc and still common thing in gambit 
---
It‚Äôs just a standard Awoken ship. 
---
What's the curated one?
---
WHERE DID HE COME FROM
---
We all paid money for the game and this is still playing the game. 
---
Doesn't work for me :( I returned to orbit and went back in and tried twice and it doesn't work for me. 
---
Jumping onto the  "log" from the middle area (forget what it's called) that leads to bank is the number one way I die.
---
More like a spartan kick as a roundhouse kick sounds like something a hunter would have.
---
Do you shoot the ultras before they get bombed?
---
As a hunter?
---
Jade rabbit is definitely being slept on so hard right now 
---
Change your Nintendo Switch theme to dark 
---
Its not mine. It's my sons I bought it for him for Christmas. He decided it be this way, so this way it will stay until he decides otherwise. 
---
He also has a halo 5 (while we are against the game we still love the chief) xbox one he plays D2 on. And tonight we both scored Jotunn lol 
---
Yeah the In Sync secret triumph.
---
No. 
---
I'll join you brother, as I too lack the title, and lowkey don't even want Dredgen title ~~just need fuckin D√ªl Incaru to give me the ship and I'll have Cursebreaker, which is all I want~~
---
So cleannnn
---
It actually can't one shot you throu a wall. Only if there's a door, or a window or anything. 
---
It's alright, designed for pvp but there are better option? 5 burst shot can do but also means sometimes not all bullets will land, decreasing your TTK.  Good for holding down a spot from range but Bygones, Go figure, and Blast furnace can do the same job or better. 
---
In the short time I used it I never found success with it but that said you won't know if its right for you till you try it.
---
You ward I'll well
---
Don't know why you're being downvoted so much, you aren't wrong. Anytime I come here it's just humor posts or someone posting their accomplishment and wanting to share it with everyone. Although dtg tends to be filled with the more salty and complaining posts but at least they're sometimes quite detailed and informative.
---
You lost more than half your motes...
---
I'll put my money on the guardian that took down Atheon, Crota, Oryx, Riven....the list goes on.
---
...*did the helmet stay on?*
---
New warlock ability, overcharge your sniper bullets for improved team mate healing!
---
Victory is all I ask 
---
What do you think? üòè
---
It‚Äôs great! Minus the giant ass orange dot in the middle!
---
F
---
Well I use genotypenull so the orange dot fits in
---
They say if you dismantle all of your weapons and armor you can equip multiple exotics
---
*Frickin Nice*
---
Ahhhh true, but with a lot of armors, like the black one, it sticks out too much .
---
Hilarious and original

Don't know why you're being downvoted so much, you aren't wrong. Anytime I come here it's just humor posts or someone posting their accomplishment and wanting to share it with everyone.

---
Same, Initial reaction was me thinking: "oh damn! Better open Destiny 2 and sleep another day" Till I read the rest of the comments.
---
I play D2 on my PC that's running off of an NVMe drive and on a Xbox One X where the game is installed on an SSD and there isn't much of a difference in loading times.
---
epic roflcopter
---
I have seen some arguments mentioning how a dedicated North (and consequently a East, West and South) might help with Raid callouts in a way
---
As for if it exists, well you could have the planetary location maps and North would be the top side, but apart from that I also noticed that SUROS Regime and MIDA have those small compasses that work incorrectly although always have you face the "North" of the map for as long as the indicating arrow is on top
---
That being said just adding it to the minimap would make much more sense than a ghost projection IMO
---
You had an opportunity to make that funny but instead you just didnt... so disappointing 
---
My friend got the same thing and posted it to her Snapchat story. Some dickface who also plays destiny called her a "loser" for having it. 
---
I find it very fun and pretty damn good. Pre-Forsaken it was one of the best pulse rifles, but if you can control your aim it's still a great gun. 5 bullets means you have a higher dps at medium range than other pulses at the cost of having less bursts per mag. I say try it
---
Destiny: Civil War
---
Orpheus rig. One of the best hunter exotics in the game. You generate orbs like crazy for your fireteam, and you get your super instantly if you manage to tether enough enemies (unlimited orbs and super)
---
I was randomly thinking about this today, but what if Hunters got Apotheosis Veil? That would be great for Golden Gun, Spectral Blades, and Shadowshot.
---
Anyways
---
Absolute Unit
---
have you seen r/Gaming?
---
I thought the faction war was done for.
---
Very defiantly a typo
---
Leviathan raid like the original?! I literally just bought both of the expansion today and the last thing I really played before getting on today was the leviathan raid. I did it once in the hardcore mode and multiple times in the normal. 
---
Dogs once did this to me on the damage phase of Calus.  Worst part was my raid group thinking I'd been fucking off on the other side of the room until I showed them video of me getting thrown all the way over there, then they couldn't stop laughing.
---
Calus was buggy for me in general.  More than once instead of teleporting me to the shadow realm with everyone else I just instantly died.  Didn't need video proof of that one, it was so instant everyone knew it was a bug.  Luckily I was going Throne room anyways so it only cost us a revive token.
---
Normal Leviathan is fine, it‚Äôs just that you don‚Äôt want to do a Prestige Leviathan run straight after you finished a different raid.
---
What‚Äôs with the logo in the bottom right of the first two frames?
---
All but Verity‚Äôs Brow are good exotics.
---
Where‚Äôs the lie?
---
Verizon FTW
---
Yeah, fell in love with it when I started using it and it feels amazing when you get the timing of each shot down. It dropped with T2 MW and I started upgrading, then hesitated and that is why I posted here. I believe I will get it to 10 now :).
---
How did they find my hunter playstyle!?
---
Took me a good 6 or 7 tries. But I found if you went to the cave side of the map it was much easier to kill the scions there. When the big guy came I was already charged up with melee power that I would 3 shot him. Eventually got help and finally completed my Ringing Nail. Zen Moment and High Impact Reserves was the roll. 
---
How did you fit in there?
---
unfortunately, that's where the similarities stop... they could use some help improving their matchmaking and ranking systems lul
---
I remember not being able to cheese this raid as I am a hunter main so my titan and warlock friends got to do all the fun stuff
---
All the people that sat this so unfunny are titans 
---
sad to break this to you but... u have to wait 3 weeks because u need stuff from the Shattered Throne
---
Additional enemies or added enemies
---
TURN BACK!  
---
Thx for the tip.
---
Shit dude I recall actually Nova bombing him many a time
---
Oh the salt when you couldn't push gatekeeper off was severe. Took people ages to figure it out the actual legit way of doing it...
---
Hammerhead
---
Yup, I got Coldheart this week from Xur
---
Fus ro nova bomb!
---
Damn I wish i had friends to do vault of glass
---
Claim the fire forged emblem to the left of that one. Then on the emblems screen, highlight the emblem and press Triangle (or Y on Xbox).
---
This is one of those emblems within an emblem.
---
I think its Mission impossible for me -\_-  
---
Competitive control I get it you need kills for Luna but you need fabled glory rank too
---
Why would it be -\_-
---
No dont wanna do that kind of wins,  
---
I think it would be best for someone skilled to play on my account.
---
Read the tos
---
good old days when we could cheese the templar with sun grenades...
---
Chamber of Starlight is faster because you can skip most of the trash there by jumping from the rock on start to a light-thingy and then to the balcony where the boss is. Takes me under 3 minutes to run it twice for 20 seeds. You can also kill all the thralls there and it will give you the 30 precision kills relatively fast. 
---
Ya the only weapon that can out damage mgs are whisper and sleeper. (I beleove dont quote me on it.)
---
Stupidity never ceases to amaze. 
---
Reminds me of the times that the afk guy would get a ghorn at the end of a crucible  match.
---
You can get it from turning in daily's. BUT I think you can get them from running the forge over and over. The chance is smaller than turning in a bounty, but I'm pretty sure that's how I got mine. 
---
That would be awesome. Especially if all the Dark Guardians lost all their Tower access. &lt;3
---
It's going to receive a nerf on the 29th. 
---
This is for this week‚Äôs challenge. Not the each person shoot a shield challenge. That‚Äôs next week.  
---
I'm on Xbone so no wavesplitter for me.  üòî
---
Currently the bolts that the Telesto shoots do about 48 damage per bolt needing only a 4 bolt kill. With the update on the 29th, Telesto will shoot 41 damage per bolt making it a 5 bolt kill. Still effective just requires more bolts on body for the kill. 
---
They really need to fix this it's funny the first time everytime after that its unbelievably annoying. 
---
Depends on your class and play style. I play as  a titan on pc. So I can titans skate so I run a 1-4-8 on my build. 
---
I'm a hunter, I tend to balance mine out. I think at the moment I have 4 mobility, 4 recovery and 6 resilience. Although I haven't tried too many different combos aside from like 10 mobility and 0/1 the others (didn't work out too well aside from leaping around like a crazed frog and getting sick airborne kills) 
---
NICHT VERGESSEN!
---
Btw, anyone looking to do this you can still use melees and supers and it will count.  We had a couple panic melees and supers (out of habit) and we thought we screwed it up but it still counted.  :)
---
Ishtar Collective has every piece of lore from both games.
---
This sub is definitely a lot more relaxed, if you're a meme guy then I'd say this is your place to go, if you're strictly business then I'd say dtg is your place. For instance this is the 1 post out of the 20 hot posts that is actually beneficial to other players to learn from, dtg posts stuff like this all the time.
---
In front of the entire enemy team...
---
Generally stay away from mobility in PVE but some people like that stat high on PVP so it comes down to preference. personally I like high recovery and medium resilience as I find recovery speed to be a bit more important than a little more health. Also depends on subclass, are you naturally being healed anyway i.e. devour lock because then go recovery or are you naturally being given more health i.e. void titan melee ability then go recovery.
---
The scorn one isn't bad either, just fast travel ride your sparrow up against the barrier and kill a couple screebs.
---
Tap x twice in a row super quickly because the jump propels you are in the direction you‚Äôre moving.
---
it might be better to grind quest steps first then get to fabled
---
Ok thx for helping 
---
No.
---
but that means i would have to rely on my teammates, which i'm sure i don't have to tell you is unreliable.
---
SALT ON THE FIELD!
---
You beat Destiny.
---
All of the NPC hunter armour is awesome. I‚Äôd love to have Ana‚Äôs cloak and chest piece
---
Get a clan, find a team, lfg.  Solo queue pvp/gambit is awful.
---
You can do it from in game where it shows what season it is that's how I purchased it on ps4 top right hand corner
---
I don't think so. Maybe when the faction rallies come back, if they ever come back...
---
Thanks man, the only options in the store where to repurchase the game for like ‚Ç¨80 with the annual pass 
---
I know that feeling all too well
---
yeah man good luck dude you got this
---
I found online that faction rallies aren‚Äôt coming back anytime soon due to Bungie making them better. 
---
Well the old ‚Äúdo literally nothing to contribute to the team and get rewarded‚Äù strategy has been well known since vanilla destiny, how else do you think someone like me could get a mythoclast 
---
I feel you took me a few minutes to get it figured out for myself the other day when I purchased it all after a break once forsaken came out 
---
You need to have a powerful frame in your inventory and grind Bergusia forge.  You can only hold 2 powerful frames per character so at max you've got 6 shots a week.  I got ultra lucky and got it on my first run and I can tell you it's fun as all hell.  Good luck!
---
I feel that, I rock saint 14 helm since my team needs the extra shield to get a kill.
---
Forge a powerful frame at Bergusia.
---
havnt played it since the week black armoury came out, so need to hope back in with some new stuff!
---
After what they tried to pull with rainbow six siege a think a lot more people hopped on that bandwagon and I don't blame them 
---
I wish I could just hope back on i got a grind to catch back up lol play forsaken for a month then left so i got lots to do still 
---
You know what? You're right. KILL THE TANK!
---
I'm not a hugely serious player, I'll probably play it again for a few months and stop for awhile 
---
Thanks it is great.i have bee'n testing it out and like you say the stability is just awesome. Something about the look of this gun awakes a good feeling in me...Have a nice day 
---
Don‚Äôt they literally hand you verity‚Äôs brow after the warmind campaign?
---
Yea, I do like those 2 pieces of hers alot.
---
This cloak might actually get me off my Titan. 
---
I want that thing he holds. *Soon...*
---
*cayde is dead appears on screen*
---
I think you probably won't be able to get your hands on this shader then...
---
When the cyro-freeze starts, there are vents on the sides of the pod that you can destroy. They give you arc orbs that you can throw at the boss. Once you hit him with four he freezes and the heroic event starts.
---
Very soon..  üòÅ
---
I am in a 12+ clan discord. It is rare to find a team when I need one, and scheduling is out of the question. So I just queue. Solving a problem by requiring non solo play is purposefully bypassing a meaningful change. Why? I can only guess. Lfg is fairly horrible, the blues there can lie, be inebriated, racist, homophobe, rude, or otherwise beyond controlling. Solo queue is my option, and an option that exists. I can complain, if I feel like it is not as good as it could be.
---
We might (hopefully) find out more during the season of the drifter :P starts in March 
---
Whispern‚Äôt
---
Is he spamming invites so you can't use your mini-map? Nice job shitting on him though, that's what he gets for calling you trash haha
---
Throw* than*
---
*Izinagi‚Äôs Burden Glares at you*
---
There‚Äôs a single case exception in the form of cluster rocket launchers against riven 
---
I just died a little.
---
Lol no this was a recording from capture gallery. The invites he sent while I was recording it in playback. He was joking when he said I was trash but still was fun to troll him ü§ó
---
Don‚Äôt mind if Shin has to die for me to get it. 
---
Sounds about right
---
The Forsaken campaign? Dreaming City is your next stop then.
---
Gold hahah. 
---
Still my favorite raid, not full of stupid puzzles that are unnecessarily difficult, no weird boss mechanic that made it not fun. It's mechanics made you feel under pressure but excited when you completed it. Now the raids have so much crap in them my reaction is always "finally".
---
It's been so long since forsaken that I've just accepted that every titan is going to be using this
---
[Actium War Rig](http://destiny.wikia.com/wiki/Actium_War_Rig) paired with it is pretty great in PVE - one of it's drawbacks is it's low magazine size, but the War Rig eliminates that so once you're at Rampage 3 you can just mow down all before you!
---
https://youtu.be/u9_axbJBdp8 for anyone who doesn't know about shin

Selling old stuff that everyone has already. Lame. Let him say at the cave. 
---
r/destinythegame is where you go when you feel like you don't wanna enjoy the game anymore 
---
Fantastic. Who‚Äôs the artist?
---
I honestly have very little trouble solo queuing on PC. Yeah I get some bad teams here and there still, but if I am actually carrying like that guy was saying then even the bad teams will win sometimes against other bad teams.
---
Tell whoever is inviting you to calm tf down
---
Yes it was a bitch getting it... and, and! I don‚Äôt like it... :( 
---
You can whisper anyone you want, but the setting is on the player you're trying to message as to whether it's autoblocked. 
---
Only thing I could find was a imgur username, k3mu.  Don't know if he's the original artist or not.  
---
Please. If you remember a Weapons of Light bubble on the middle platform and 5 Gjallarhorns, then i respect you.
---
I flew like a turd in the wind when participating in public event on Titan and them fucken scorch cannon bubbles spawned in. 
---
It‚Äôs delayed enough they are looking at putting the exotic catalyst in the game elsewhere
---
I spend 98% of my playing time on my Titan, but I still don't have the One-Eyed mask. :(
---
A for effort. He may not have succeeded, but he damn sure is a hero
---
I see you got barbecue sauce on my bathrobe...
---
I agree that it was way to easy to get them all before but now you can play for weeks and not get one.
---
They went too far the other way, another fix is Xur perhaps not sell Y2 ones yet but have the dates engram have a chance to drop Y2 exotics, if you have not gotten a exotic drop all week Xur is a way to balance out and he only gives one a week so it‚Äôs will take months to get everything using him 
---
Better dupe protecting is needed saw someone get the same Y1 garbage exotice Y1 multi times in a row 
---
Dark Souls memes? In my Destiny 2 subreddit? RNG has truly been kind to me.
---
[removed]
---
Transmat firing!
---
Yes. It can even drop from killing forge saboteurs.
---
Haha awesome stuff good work
---
Ehh you can beat it easily with an errentil anyway.
---
Backup plan erentil isn‚Äôt too hard to come across.
---
Now that was EPIC
---
Not to be a dick but I‚Äôm just curious, why exactly are you looking for an SMG god roll? SMGs are in an awful spot right now, so I was just wondering. And to answer your question yes, the Augmented Atalanta-D can drop from any forge along with all the other Augmented Y1 weapons
---
Thanks 
---
The prices are crazy but 1/2 of what they list while shady is not something I have a issue with.   The play with us, that side of it fine I can get it pay for a good fireteam to play with that ensures you get through a activity/quest.  Ok fine it keeps you from dealing with random son LFG but the account recovery is not ok
---
Thanks for the help!!
---
Genji from overwatch,is that you?  
---
Banning for account sharing I get but if you want to pay for specific people to play with you then how is that a issue, not supporting the idea and wouldn‚Äôt do it but don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs an issue.
---
Technically any contest where you buy X to play with the developers would be a bannable offense.  And the streamers doing it to show a gun they don‚Äôt have should be bannable but that won‚Äôt happen considering how much Bungie catered to them getting views in the disaster that was the labs
---
That quest does not require ANY dlc or pass
---
Not that exotic drops are easy to find but the cold heart was added to the general exotic loot pool about a year ago
---
Same. Got it from the nightfall
---
Good to know there's more
---
Aaaaand as always it‚Äôs completely useless
---
no
---
If you only need 5 motes and you deposit 15 it only banks 5. It does not send an Ogre. You are delaying for nothing.
---
No the EP shotgun is not the only draw.   Yellow bar and orange bar enemies are easy to farm there for Black Armory stuff.
---
The same enemies tend to get farmed for Prime and Exotic drops as it was figured ot X enemies killed drops a Prime or Exotic engram.  Yellow and orange count for more kills so EP farming round 6 and 7 over and over for a bit can get good drops and the poss drops a shader that breaks down into Shards.
---
If you only need 5 motes and you deposit 15 it only banks 5. You do not send an Ogre in that situation. When the Drifter calls for you to bank there is absolutely no benefit to gathering more motes. Get you Primeval up as quickly as possible, having it up first is an advantage.
---
Its not the advantage part that upsets people its the UNFAIR advantage that upsets people the oem is unbalanced and unfair by design everybody just wants it nerfed except titans cuz its op af
---
If they added a Dracula cape I would grind for days just to get it...like the one he wears in the Netflix series.  I‚Äôve always wanted a huge cape for my hunter. Bonds, capes, marks have always just been lame.
---
Figurine
---
Perhaps they just want it to complete their collections tab. 
---
You can get it if it‚Äôs in your collections...if not you‚Äôll have to wait.
---
Welcome to destiny lol
---
Too bad its a trash weapon
---
About that. Because it takes so much ammo I dont think it can compete against whisper, sleeper or any mg.
---
Also its gonna be extremely hard to get for most.
---
Mainly because they don't even have the ability to play with the forges.
---
My\_name\_is\_byf is a youtuber that does videos about the lore. He has a three part video on the drifter that is really cool if you want to learn more about him. Excellent videos which help put all the lore together instead of searching around.
---
But, if you have 2 special ammo finders and one (or even two) sniper scavenger perks? You will have more than enough ammo when it comes to damage phases. In fact the ‚Äúdamage phase‚Äù turns into just shooting the boss three or four times. I‚Äôve been using it nonstop since I got it, and it is so much more viable than people realize. 
---
Thanks for the recommendation, I‚Äôll check it out 
---
It should. Only digital content can't be sold
---
Even if disc was used? 
---
He means peer to peer, not pay to play
---
yeah.... but then when it came time to actually kill the boss, cause you couldn't cheese it anymore, who was all like "Wahhhhh hunter needed golden gun with Extraterrestrial Eveningfalcon " we got the comeback :D
---
I I pay that much can you also throw in a Not Forgotten and a Mountaintop too Bungie?
---
Congrats and enjoy! It‚Äôs a great weapon!
---
OMG IT'S BUETIFUL
---
Yeah had a game the other night where we had enough to pull prime and then there was a dude with 12 motes (he had the required notes to summon), he goes to get three more, takes a meandering path back, we get invaded, he dies, enemy summons, game over. 
---
...people make me really sad sometimes 
---
armamentarium and pulse grenades also did the trick.
---
Now i need to work on upgrading it!
---
But i love the whisper, it is realy strong! :D
---
Ah, of course, the machine-gun-knife-trick
---
I have a pretty solid augmented Atalanta-D. SMG‚Äôs are definitely not in a good spot but I use it when completing some of the Ada bounties when a specific gun is required.
---
When to kill the templar you'd just chill on the hobgoblin platforms
---
Gg man I‚Äôve been working so hard for mine but I can‚Äôt seem to find a team
---
I have a vicious scowl on my face that needs me to reach out and punch you.
---
I love hunter armor like this but I think they‚Äôd have way too many clipping issues to actually put cool cloaks in the game
---
When you fall in love but she asks for advice asking out one of your friends, (can confirm from personal experience)

"That's for blowing up my sparrow!"

So if someone is reselling legendary forsaken edition its not worth the trouble?

Why have I never called Celestial, ‚ÄúThe Hawk.‚Äù That sounds way cooler!
---
Basically Titans' code of the missile in summary. Lol
---
Dredgen Yor
---
 Awesome game.  Not gonna lie, your username made me gag. 
---
If someone is reselling it without the code then it is just the base game. I'd say scam alert. 
---
I hate you..
---
[You](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/cardfight/images/a/ac/Joke_over_your_head.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150210143007).
---
Should work without a problem. (I just have pc and xbox)
---
There are more than enough businesses selling them. Gamestop sells used PS4 games,too. So it should be the same with ps4
---
Thanks for sharing but this changes like every 30 minutes...
---
wait... you don't have an exotic.... so you buy the expensive engram, because the engram guarantees to give you a year one exotic, and you are surprised it gave you a gun you didn't have? so really [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/BU8YJ03) is your reaction.

You on pc?

Gimme Petra‚Äôs armor any day

Understandable

##*highly concerned*

With full ammo and super. 
---
Swag. 
---
\*muffled ancient greek noises\*
---
Huh, TIL
---
Give me Uldren's cloak pls bungo
---
Isn't hammerhead the same archetype as avalanche but with better stats
---
Thought it's daily. Also, no one really cares too much unless it's a sim seeds for shards day, so...
---
This is my strategy for soloing nightfalls they better not patch it because of this post.
---
That sounds terrifying. That doesn't belong in a looter shooter.
---
Same
---
Agreed
---
Not like it matters lol. The blast radius on nova bomb is garbungo 
---
I hope bungie makes him look like this looks sick
---
When you don't care because you took out Riven, Crota, Oryx, Aksis, Etc.
---
Shawn, gauntlet took a lot longer then an hour 
---
If I recall correctly, all that matters is 4 or 5 resilience: this allows you to take 2 body shots in PvP from a fair chunk of guns, instead of 1. Otherwise it's personal preference, though most people will say Recovery is the safer bet if you're newer to the game.
---
Ok then
---
At least you dont use it in crucible
---
Right?
---
Love that skylanders poster, I remember when I played the first one on my wii when I was 6
---
Blades comin round the corner but i had to get the boy wit the green weapons
---
Sorry. I meant the image.
---
I would just LOVE to see this as an option in Crucible. Maybe Crucible labs to see if it gains traction. 
---
No, they aren‚Äôt lol. They‚Äôre easier to use on PC. Blade Barrage can kill any super so, does that make every super in the game only ok-ish? &amp; The armor isn‚Äôt low enough for 1 person to drop you off before you can kill them. If you 1v1 someone &amp; you don‚Äôt kill them while you have Hammers active that‚Äôs your fault for not activating in a smart way or not using it correctly. I‚Äôve never been melted by 1 person when using any super in the game unless they hit me with Blade Barrage.
---
Pay up
---
What???
---
Stairs: the number one killer of guardians since 2014
---
What is that gun and these gloves ? Looks dope
---
Buy that booster thing
---
But it‚Äôs like 30$ Canadian 
---
You can buy a level boost that bumps you up to forsaken. It skips red war, curse of osiris and warming though.
---
Thats the only way
---
Shit
---
MTG memes, I like it.
---
Major flaw in your logic. Kills aren't the same as defeats, and you said he got 34 kills. 34 defeats I can believe, 34 kills? No. Also, I may have called your life pathetic, but I'm only toxic to those who ooze toxicity. Everything you say belittles everyone else, so I gave you a taste of your own medicine. If you can't understand that than that honestly speaks volumes about your self awareness and your personality. You basically amount to a playground bully who has to put others down to feel good about himself. Excuse me for trying to put you in your place, but sadly it's obvious you're far beyond reason and you'll just continue to live your life putting others down for your own personal gain and thinking it's ok or even makes you cool. You respond to peoples disbelief by insulting them instead of taking the adult approach and just not replying at all. You even have a post on another subreddit asking for the devs to put options IN GAME to put down your own teammates. You seriously need help.
---
**Hello there , I do need a code..!**
---
I've noticed it too, seems like the enemy had to be a specific distance away--not too close, not too far
---
This is my favorite thing to do in destiny. It just feels so smooth to throw that many knives 
---
I'd rather aesthetic than functionality, so I use Dunemarchers over One-Eyed Mask just because of the sheer ugliness of that helmet 
---
Am I the only one who thinks of the Reno 911 Miami skit where Jonesy and Garcia  find the alligator in the pool and this one guy pops up over a fence and goes oooh  looks like we got a couple of blueberries.
---
Nah, then we'd actually get some nice asthetic looking armor
---
THIS IS WHAT LOVE SOUNDS LIKE
---
Didn‚Äôt know this was a big deal, had 19 on my hunter like since before forsaken.
---
I wonder if this part is skippable. Can you destroy the doors with grenades/rockets/grenade launchers?
---
I have a 20 set on my warlock and titan, I just started this hunter abt 3 weeks ago
---
How to i defeat the infamous guitar boss though? 
---
In my experience I had seen it to be true. It's possible that I am wrong. However, using up more time to get a bigger blocker is NEVER worth it. The amount of time you spend getting more motes is going to be greater than the extra time for them to kill the blocker you sent over. It takes seconds to kill a blocker, and honestly between a small and a large the difference is probably negligible. Blockers do not matter at the primeval phase anymore, get your primeval up as fast as possible.
---
This hurts my heart. Also very true.
---
IKR. Guys let's spend 30 seconds getting two points then u can do all the killing u want 
---
So after beating vault collect all ammo blocks and orbs and dont wear tracking emblems
---
It‚Äôs probably a bug, what subclass and tree are you running?
---
I don't think Bungo is capable of such a thing.
---
Try the discord, they got LFG channels
---
Because apparently the ammo blocks and orbs dont despawn and while on heart it overloads the game
---
Care to send me the link? Or where I can find it?
---
Anyone else think this looks like Deej?
---
Man, I‚Äôm like 3 PL away from it! Congratulations dude, I‚Äôm proud of you my fellow guardian. Keep it up!
---
Fuck I'd delete one of my other characters for Ana's cloak. 
---
Cool thanks
---
Then you have to play through
---
All you need to do to pick up the pulse frame (if Ada has it this week, I haven't checked) is unlock the Forge
---
If she doesn't have it this week, you have to wait
---
Thanks, will be needing that luck for sure.. I'll see how far I can get with that
---
Dammit 
---
Doesn't change the fact that you cheated though does it.
---
Not really a hard challenge when you cheat
---
Does it count progress if you don't complete the run? Like if I run out of time getting the chests do I keep what I was able to get? 
---
Ahh ok, ill give that a try. Thank you
---
This one should work, https://discord.gg/PV9pSec
---
Thx, you can also do it. Wish you the best. 
---
Every. Single. Time. 
---
Well, ironically, you're the one not giving enough argument. You think that something that "goes against Destiny muscle memory." is OP intrinsically, which it isn't. That's how a large amount of exotics work in this game - going against mechanics or punishing muscle memory. Like think of the feedback fence for example, it punishes you for trying to fight the meleeing titan back. Or the reflecting slide titan exotic. Not an exotic, but mid arcstrider can reflect too and that's "against muscle memory" of shooting the guy.
---
What's your ratio? 21:9?
---
Im so sorry my lord you are the best player to ever exist i will do petras run agian and not try to save time
---
I'm not saying if it's worth it or not, just saying that it does indeed send a blocker still as many believe you don't seeing as the text only says so many motes were deposited. 
---
You can only have one legendary frame on you at the time.
---
No problem
---
Dodging. It‚Äôs been available for a while now. 
---
Wow arnt you cool!
---
Class abilties = walls/dodge/rift.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, when is shin malphur coming? Do I need to get back into this game?
---
If he‚Äôs talking about what I think he‚Äôs talking about it‚Äôs called Castlevania. It‚Äôs brutal but a very good series so far.
---
Have you played Halo 4?
---
I'm sorry if I appeared oversensitive. I just wanted a straightforward answer, and I didn't appreciate the underlying message that I'm crying about having to work hard for my loot. I was just confused by the bounty. Now I know better. Yes I'm trying to do the exotic quest, but I haven't found the time to play since I got the bounty, and with 4 days left I don't think I will make it. I'll just try my best and probably wait for another one to drop.
---
Looks like the drifter without a beard
---
Meanwhile I have the ornament, but not the weapon itself :(
---
Yeah im pretty sure it has the worst time to kill in the game
---
Eww no please don't do that bungie. Here's a better one .   
---
" Bungie make it so your player base can git good"
---
Breakneck autorifle and Shards of Galanor gloves
---
Never claimed to be the best player, just pointing out that completing a hard challenge by cheating isn't really something to brag about
---
I honestly wish I wasn‚Äôt at max light now. It makes all those powerful engrams seem very lackluster when string the same chest piece twenty times a week.
---
Best seat in the house for this funeral pyre. 
---
What else would it be they aren't gonna change the type of gun it was in D1 
---
Congratulations 
---
And how is a tips post bragging
---
Got mine yesterday too lmao
---
I don‚Äôt get it, so does that ghost make the chest give you better rewards?
---
This is why the Awoken didn‚Äôt want Guardians crawling around in there.
---
Thank goodness I'm not the only one who does this
---
I think someone needs to introduce you to paragraphs...
---
Breakneck getting stronger? Awesome. Also heard they‚Äôre buffing Scout rifles as well
---
"Hunters don't have any good melee abilities."
---
Lmao sure bud keep in mind ive been thriving better in this meta then any otherüòÇ
---
no more doctorine pls
---
It's a rant bruh paragraphs be damned
---
Yeah i think people saying it's thrash dont know how and when to use it ;)
---
You can‚Äôt see the animation from the angle but if you look at the kill feed, I actually did ‚Äúlaugh‚Äù
---
I literally have 1 649 item, the rest is 650. I'm waiting for gauntlets now...
---
But, ya know, if those gauntlets were Shards Of Galanor, that'd be great...
---
Trying to earn a set of blue wings? Bold. Let‚Äôs see where this goes.

So the. What do you have complaints also nice brag lol

I haven't looked through it in a while, but I'm pretty sure you might be able to find exactly what your looking for in the FAQ that is Stickied.

Also, you should be able to find plenty of posts if you use the search bar to search this sub as I see this exact question many times every day.

Good luck Guardian!

Yeah 
---
‚ÄúSAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND‚Äù
---
Given that the lame cloaks still clip like a bitch I'd put up with it for a cool one.
---
REKT
---
My main (hunter) has a rare bounty. But of course it requires a full set of black armory forge armor. And good ol RNGeesus won‚Äôt give me legs and I‚Äôve done easily 30+ forges
---
*the Drifter licks his lips*
---
Hey if it works it works
---
Yes, the same Leviathan Raid, but the Prestige Mode that makes everything harder.
---
Congrats Guardian!! Well done!!
---
How is this done?
---
The modifier brawler and maybe a little help from Orpheus spathe.
---
GIVE ME OSIRIS'S ARMOR
---
Is the content in the Annual Pass content that *only exists* for the *duration* of the pass? The term "Annual Pass" makes it sound like it's a series of events, or content that otherwise expires, as opposed to a bunch of DLC. 
---
I ask because I play games very, very slowly. If I had that Annual Pass today, I wouldn't finish the content within a year and so I wouldn't buy it if it expires. 
---
Nice one guardian, if ur on xb1 and want to run for catalyst, hit me up. 
---
Currently only drops from the baron bosses in the heroic baron missions.
---
PC sadly.
---
But i did catalyst + chests already with 2 other awesome people! 
---
Thanks for invite anyways! :D
---
I haven't been able to find a raid team. Haven't done half as many I did in D1 :c
---
They aren't buffing precision ARs. You can but breakneck back away.
---
I've done both. I'm at about 1050. So I'm halfway there but it's getting difficult 
---
Fast work, nice one..! 
---
And had a damage buff for firing from the hip that it doesnt have in d2 so its basically a trust you are supposed to hipfire
---
Congrats man, endgame will be easier for you now :)
---
It never occurred to me to question why we called them ‚Äúmobs.‚Äù 
---
This kinda blew my mind 
---
You don't seem excited about that..
---
Yeah. Thats not a shotgun. That's a saw.
---
Yes Sir, that and the Kibou AR3! Those 2 were my favorites
---
It‚Äôs all good I respect that
---
I want a poncho like the one Clint Eastwood wears in the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.
---
It was over a three year span. Destiny 2 is such a downgrade and miles behind d1, period. 
---
It only drops with powerful frames
---
Of course a hunter, the one class that doesnt care about mechanics of a game but only cares about loot would have the most basic of a meta...
---
only drops from powerful frames
---
took me one powerful frame 
---
Congrats Guardian!!
---
You only get it from powerful frames in the Bergusia Forge. Also you get le monargue from powerful frames in every forge except the Bergusia Forge. You only get two powerful frames per character weekly. 
---
They aren‚Äôt viable at mid range. Not even a maxed retold or dust rock can kill you at mid range. If you‚Äôre getting killed by shotguns then you‚Äôre in close range. 9.5 meters is the furthest a god roll shotgun can one shot and its inconsistent at that range. 
---
You have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about. 
---
Mercury is pretty clearly the worst zone of all. It‚Äôs basically just a big room. 
---
They have said they're aiming for a fix at the end of Jan.
---
they get ads and monetization regardless, 10 minutes lets them put multiple midroll ads in the video so they can make even more money. either way its obnoxious because people like houndish make videos with next to no substance and often repeat themselves from previous videos as filler, and constantly talk to their audiences like they're children.
---
I still stand by what i say btw most shotties are still consisent at doing a lot of damage outside that range 
---
I still want to have like a long flowing cloak even if it was purely cosmetic 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they all were when they first came out. 
---
1 order, 2 words, Estab Neut.
---
Lol
---
Noice!
---
I always just associated it with mobsters
---
Achieved in excellent fashion too.
---
Yes, you can buy the Annual Pass and Forsaken separately. I did so.  
---
Got Forsaken 2 months ago and got the Annual Pass a few weeks ago.  
---
That's not a big problem with the new forge. Get the Forge Poly thing from ada 1 everytime you go to do your frame and you get a piece. It is random but I've done like 3 frames a day and have gotten atleast 2 full sets of BA armor.
---
You can get Le Monarque at Bergusia.
---
It requires less skill to get a kill than probably any other weapon in the game besides a rocket launcher, and yes, in comp I see almost as much Telesto as shotguns. It‚Äôll be a bit better to deal with once it‚Äôs nerf hits though. The problem is that it‚Äôs right now doing the damage of a high impact fusion with the charge time of a low damage fusion and due to the bolts sticking and detonating, doesn‚Äôt even have to be as accurate as a regular fusion rifle to net a kill. Hits in the general vicinity of the person you‚Äôre aiming at usually result in a kill. That‚Äôs why so many people hate it. 
---
Ok nice thank you. I‚Äôve mainly been running volundr and izanami
---
I will never accept the change to power. It'll always be light.
---
You're a god send man. Moments like these make me wish I had gold. They work fantastically, thank you.
---
No they aren‚Äôt. You have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about. You can stand by your comments but they‚Äôre wrong and clearly just making stuff up based on how it ‚Äúfeels‚Äù rather than facts. This just makes you sound like an idiot to be honest. 
---
Shotgun range has been extensively tested. You can test it out yourself with a friend in a private match. Just have him stand in front of a wall so he doesn‚Äôt move and use a Borealis to check the distance. 
---
Mo 
---
Were you able to from the Xbox marketplace? Or through the game menu? 
---
No worries. Glad you like them
---
The effort I put into getting that winter armour...
---
You just made my day good sir.
---
It is not, it's only available during the third week of the curse. You can tell which week it is by what the Dreaming City looks like. [Here is an album of screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/U3CvlXm) comparing the first and third weeks. If you don't want to physically travel there, look at where Petra is. 
---
The Strand: First, least cursed week
---
Divalian Mists: Second, middle week
---
Rheasilvia: Third, most cursed week.
---
*sees it‚Äôs not Taniks Cloak- leaves thread a little sadder*
---
Tried using autorifles in Gambit for the Breakneck quest, got seriously pissed off by how long it took to kill enemies, gave up. I'm hoping the buff will make them worth trying again.
---
I have no doubt, I never managed to get the chest. Not for lack of trying. I will admit I was slightly envious when I saw this. Great work though.
---
I love the Clint Eastwood style theme
---
How?
---
You guys are actually lucky, it broken as hell. Put it in the hands of the worst pvp player you know and watch their KD climb. They‚Äôre reducing the damage because if the beam touches your toe your dead. 
---
No problem! I only run those forges now if theres a bounty that tells me to. Otherwise I've been getting much better loot from bergusia. Also, if you get an obsidian radiance in your inventory dont "use" it!! Take it to ada and trade for the radiance mod, it makes BA weapons do more damage in forges.
---
The whole part of petra's run that's hard is the not dying.
---
You openly admit you had your fireteam leader go last so he could kick anyone who died so as not to fail.
---
So you cheated, meaning dying at that part would not make you fail. 
---
No deaths
---
thank you
---
*Uldren Sov joins you for dinner*

I meant it as a joke sorry I'll a /s tag but why so serious about a game m8?

Was he talking about he monarch or shadowshot, cause that kills was mainly the shadow shot.

It‚Äôs coming back?

How many depressings?

Can I just get Uldren's armor?
---
Love using this instead of a primary.
---
Best tip for anyone new. In the first room of the mission, you can jump up via the bones (horns?) That form an arch as you enter the room itself. Also, when you enter the green room, do NOT forget to immediately turn around after the very first ledge so you can take the shortcut. There's 4 minutes for anyone not yet aware. (Some guides completely skip those, and it drove me insane my first few runs.)
---
I'm not saying turn all of pvp into halo just comp. So it'll be balanced and truly be competitive.
---
Pretty much anything that drapes how a real cloak does would be awesome. I would grind so hard for it. 
---
Umm, yea..  lol
---
Don‚Äôt ever let anyone tell you how to play the game.  I went through so many groups for competitive and people telling me I wasn‚Äôt good enough and just being over all mean and I finally did it and improved overall.  I‚Äôm so happy.  Just wanted to share with you guys.  
---
Awwww where did the Titan hurt you?
---
Blade barrage them 
---
Contact bungie 
---
Thank you :) I hope you‚Äôll be able to complete the set next Christmas!
---
Thank you fellow guardian 
---
If I can find a team üòÇ
---
Same here :(
---
Are those photos of your tv?
---
Hunter next for me!
---
I wish you the best of luck
---
Ew, console
---
Haven‚Äôt played D2 since forsaken release... Lemonade?
---
They sure do
---
I feel it on my Titan pretty bad, it just drifts.
---
Good job! I‚Äôm sick of people kicking me from lfg groups because my KD isn‚Äôt high enough so I know the feeling you just have to stick with it and strive to be better so then those people will come to you one day wanting to be on your team
---
I can dream.
---
Yep. I didn't know how to make a multi level picture from my ps4 so I used my phone to take pictures of the TV. 
---
Either way the video is not proving good now gameplay
---
Yeah man for sure.  I‚Äôm not a sweat but I‚Äôm not bad.  I went and found so many different people that said they‚Äôre calm and willing to help then we lose 1 match and they throw a fit and blame everything on me or my friends when it was their fault.  If you keep grinding anyone can do it.  That‚Äôs why I say don‚Äôt let mean toxic people tell you how to play the game you like.  
---
Your boyfriend is a scrub... 1v1 me! I'll destroy you both! PS4 anytime any place!
---
I hoped you tea bagged him. Lol. 
---
Also, the armor he‚Äôs wearing makes it look like he‚Äôs wearing a pantsuit. 
---
I need to ask someone, i'm i wrong when i think that Riven is the third sibling in the savathun, oryx and (riven) hivegod-tri
---
o?
---
Hand cannons should ALWAYS be better than auto rifles. They take well placed shots and good aim to use correctly, auto rifles are just a spam weapon any noob could pick up and wreck with if they could compete with other weapons
---
I think you guys are overreacting. Bungie won‚Äôt buff them enough.
---
Oh awesome 
---
You're about a year late, and not funny or clever 
---
Can you read?
---
Tell me what incase means
---
With Activision out of the picture, there's hope that we might not have to deal with randomized purchases going forward!
---
Good one
---
ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
What year is that ornament?
---
It is the only time I enjoy strikes
---
have they adressed the issue ?
---
Are u on pc?? That field of view is nice...
---
My turn to post this next cycle. 
---
I just want some better looking bath towels. 
---
I reached 650 a couple of days ago, but my Hunter looks horrible compared to your Warlock. All the Hunter armors are garbage
---
Sure as long as they‚Äôre good
---
Degenerates.
---
I‚Äôm only 15 myself and my mates 14 so we aren‚Äôt bothered as long as they‚Äôre not annoying 
---
No, like everything else, its ignored. Expect some small fix that makes things worse in 4-5 months. 
---
That pic is giving me Vietnam flashbacks 
---
Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.
---
Woa that works with Prometheus lens? I didn‚Äôt know that 
---
It feels so... Fluid. Complete. One movement, one kill. Another follows another.
---
/poetical
---
Um hello? Baeda-1? Best tsundere 
---
My question is how are there people at Bungie who have looked at armor in the past, like Wormhusk, fix it because it‚Äôs broken, *and then add another equally or more broken exotic into the game?!*
---
Do they never learn?
---
Definitely with this one. It can't roll any reload perks except for alloy mag.
---
it‚Äôs okay to say fucking online 
---
You are who I aspire to be.
---
Malfeasance is pretty bad in PvP, and if TLW is anything like it was at the end of D1 it won't be that insane. It doesnt have the increased damage when firing from the hip.
---
That sais, Luna's and NF can suck a dick, i have Luna and i never use it because its just not fun.
---
G U A R D I A N, THE DEFILED!
---
Ya I know. Stupid RNG bounty.
---
Well i guess the auto tageting makes sure that doesnt happen. Hc can beat scout rifles in long range battels,  should it happen no, it does. Hc beat ar in short and mid range battles,  hc even can be pulse in mid range battles.  Hc are too powerful against all the primary weapon archetypes.  Bungie had the same problem with d1 until they nerfed hc range to where they should be. 
---
Honestly, 99% of the D1 cloaks were WAY better than anything D2 has to offer.
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 13.
---
/r/Fireteams 
---
Oh so if you miss one bullet from the hc you dont have 8 more to shoot?  You instantly run out of your clip if you miss one shot? 
---
#cursebreaker
---
Hunters need some capes like that that wrap around, and aren‚Äôt a 3 inch by 4 foot long strip of fabric
---
Luck really. I always take off tracking emblems but even that isn‚Äôt 100% successful 
---
And issa THICC SLICE
---
Since the playing with fire perk activates when you kill something with the burn debuff on them you can use the 1) the knives them self. 2) Prometheus lens.  3) the new forge fusion rifle. 4) the two tailed fox. now im sure there are more than that which can cause the burn but those are the ones off the top of my head
---
They already added Andal Brask's outfit as Eververse armor, why not other major characters?
---
Malfeasance to me is better for pve,  again my opinion. Its perk of the drilling bullet only activates aftet mutliple shots on same enemy. 
---
Well that's disheartening.... 
---
I like to use Trust with snapshot or a fusion rifle with backup plan. Something that can bail you out close quarters or finish someone off. (I like to use bygones in crucible, so that's where my suggestions come from)
---
To be fair he did pop his arc staff
---
I found Cerberus+1 to be decent. Didn‚Äôt really need a shotgun for me 
---
I hate the perk it has for gun slingers
---
Nope
---
It is a fun build so far. Thanks for checking it out!
---
Sometimes if I'm bored
---
&gt; hER
---
For crucible use something like trust or a shotgun for up close, for pve use whatever guns you like most as pve is generally pretty easy 
---
I ran sweet business and it wrecked! I burned through adds like butter and made that part of the quest super easy. Because of that quest, I switch to my Sweet Business every once in awhile when I run Gambit, it‚Äôs too much fun. 
---
I didn't have enough sparkly stuff to buy it with.
---
I didn't complain about being under leveled, the guy said there was 2 people left that aren't max light. I'm clearly one of them I do almost all the weekly milestones I'm just super unlucky all I get is energy weapons and chest pieces. 
---
Yes. All debuffs do not stack, so this includes the hunter tether, the hunter Shattering Strike, the titan Hammer Strike, and tractor cannon. One enemy can only have a single one of those applied at a time. 
---
Well, statistically 4/5 people enjoy it
---
I went old school and used Uriels Gift for the Breakneck grind. Wasn't to bad. Only bad against tanky Cabal. 
---
bro I had the doctrine adept in d1, it was stupidly op before nerf
---
Thought they did thanks 
---
Cloaks and more capes without hoods like the black armoury and Christmas event one would be amazing.
---
Damn, I've been trying to get the Nick Fergussen for ages
