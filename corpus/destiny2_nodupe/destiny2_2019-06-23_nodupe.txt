So I could only acquire 1 per cycle, instead of 1 per character then?

Oh god I can‚Äôt unsee that

Bottom tree arcstryder dodge does lessong registration.

The pain when u and 2 others are working on making it heroic just to see that one thing using their super to finish the boss
---
With a better Devils no less.
---
I know that's the beloved sniper, but what's the best role for pvp?
---
It reduces damage taken by 40%, has no effect on how super melee attacks are registered, to my knowledge.
---
Master worked armor doesnt affect PVP
---
That finisher. *Chef kiss*
---
Tis true updoot for optimism

RULE 14. YOU MUST TELL US WHAT WAS IN THE EXOTIC ENGRAM
---
I‚Äôve claimed both and the rewards are nowhere to be seen, I know we get tribute hall sometime in July
---
Every individual projectile counts as a person, so he was probably using wardcliff.
---
What's the other one for
---
Borealis
---
What is that thing? We don't have them where I live lol
---
Oh thank god, I thought this was a pc post and just didnt understand
---
There‚Äôs r/fireteams, which might help you find a clan.

Defeating combatants in gambit using calus themed armour and weapons. So I bet you there will be one for strikes or nightfalls maybe
---
hell yea rules workin again

Put that Erintil away

Yup

I didn‚Äôt play d2 when it launched I‚Äôve only been playing for a few months and I love the game! Menagerie is wicked. I‚Äôm very excited for shadow keep I plan on pre order ASAP

Got the Trinity ghoul to drop as an engram for me in a random vanguard strike. Shit is satisfying

Very, or after a very sweaty comp game and you see it drop during the scoreboard

Oh most def, haven't felt that kinda joy since d1 lmao

It's for the 2nd encounter chest(jumping puzzle) in CoS. You need to loot it 5 times.
---
your right! "no escape"
---
People suck, just call your friend.
---
It was mayhem last week or the week before
---
Thought of that. His cellular company doesn‚Äôt allow for a lot of call time so we wouldn‚Äôt be able to keep a call for that long. Don‚Äôt want to waste all his minutes.
---
Also this
---
Minutes? I haven't heard of a company limiting talk time in a long while. Outside the US, I assume? Sorry you dealt with the bullshit.
---
It says until stowed. When you press the touchpad you pull out your ghost putting away your weapon therefore it's doing exactly what it says it does.
---
Same deal with Delerium. You'll lose the X3 killing tally.
---
I'll be honest and say I'm not very good with LoW, maybe a little bit contributing to the fact that I never hold onto unflinching shotgun gear or anything for shotguns in that manner because I never needed it for my wishbringer.
---
Isn't this from the D1 Nightstalker cinematic?
---
I guess if you finish the Destinations Triumph page there isn‚Äôt much.
---
The only raid you could solo 100% is Crotas End in D1. You can not solo Leviathan
---
Chaperone. Arbalest. Gunnoras axe. Revoker.

---
Wish there was a bolt action sniper in d2. That would be dopeeeee.
---
So basically you hate Activision. Just like the rest of us. But you‚Äôre so full yourself that instead of just agreeing with everyone you have to come here and act like you have some form of heightened intellect because all of us are incorrectly hating Activision.
---
No one started hating Activision as soon as they entered the industry, people didn‚Äôt even start hating them till a few years ago when they started doing their predatory tactics. When people say ‚Äúcuz it‚Äôs Activision‚Äù that‚Äôs a short way of saying ‚Äúcuz they make sub AAA quality games while still charging full price then riddle the game with micro transactions.‚Äù
---
But if you‚Äôre only comfort in life is having to view yourself as an intellectual surrounded by idiots who are always wrong even when you agree, go right on ahead
---
Such general gifts
---
Same thing happened to me earlier today
---
Don‚Äôt worry I gave you an upvote
---
Arcblades already had instakill backstabs, and crouch to cloak. What made Khepri so nice was that it opened up some Arcblade nodes for the player to choose other stuff. The only thing that Khepri did originally that was unique was the powerful poison damage with the melee something while cloak.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you were a Hunter main, you'd realize how insanely nice it is to throw down a smoke and have 2 seconds of wall hacks. I only wish that it lasted longer if it procced with melee damage
---
This just proves that you can't contribute to a discussion. I could care less about upvotes but obviously you do. These are my thoughts being spewed out by my thoughts and once again im sorry you're up but you need to relax.
---
I‚Äôm not bold enough to get on that grind yet
---
True, I have been wanting the Sniper for so long but cant get it. Mostly because I have school.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen a single person using it on console. Apparently it‚Äôs a PC problem though and I dunno what‚Äôs going on on PC
---
Quickplay does not have any sort of skill based matchmaking, so I think you are just unlucky.
---
Or when they keep blasting and kill the boss the very second it goes heroic so you get fuck-all
---
The game doesn't recognize a triumph score that low. It thinks you're a bot.
---
Obvious I'm just messing around.........

The fun thing about Lunafaction Boots is they work in any rift with any Warlock Subclass. Slap on an Empowering Rift if you want to hit them high numbers and go to town.
---
Raid banners are 5000 glimmer each. The glimmer cap is 100000. 10000 / 5000 is 20. Idk what black magic fuckery you did but you can get at most 20 raid banners from max glimmer.
---
Legendary shards on the other hand...
---
If you die as you cross the line your body counts as 6 crosses. Before you could finish the whole gauntlet in just one go of it, but now you still have to make it launch 3 times/run the time out before it gives you the flawless credit.

haven‚Äôt played d1 crucible in a year in a half, sorry about not mentioning it thoüò∂
---
You must be a chaperone shotgun main then...

Ititans loves using this oem, shoulder charge and this damn gun
---
It's an honor thing. The Gold Saint of Taurus did not repair his horn when Seiya cut it off. Old school wrestlers would keep their faces a secret but would show it to a rival if they beat them etc etc. 
---
Ikora smacked his ass, him leaving his horn off let's everyone know what she did.
---
Ran a strike last night and got a ton of grenade launcher kills and didn't go up by one single point. Stuck at 49%
---
Lucky to even get a blue now. Better off just finding a random spawn chest. 
---
We all complained Strikes didn't give enough loot compared to Public Events. So instead of bidding strike loot. They needed public even loot to hell.
---
It‚Äôs decent with the new opulence dlc, but it becomes free sometime this year.

Reminded me of when I first got OEM, after xur sold it lol.
---
The game itself took a while to get good, so reviews wouldn't reflect its quality well.
---
That being said, some research.  A lot of the game is going free in September.
---
You were the chosen one!

She said I'm Shaft motha f*cka

Not always the players fault as the game doesn't tell how to start the heroic event. I just learned it now.

Yeah you should report his first message and return the favor. Foul language isn't prohibited.

Try Skype or something like that even Snapchat.

If everyone is dead there's no dps so he did good

How did you answer your own question and are still lost...?
---
This is why I refused to pick up the armor quests
---
Your politeness doesn't excuse your flat-out wrongness. The point I'm making is that it's *extremely* infuriating to die to a handed-out kill like LoW. And Luna's got nerfed hardcore, so that's something to think about.
---
&gt;which is why they enjoy it. because they feel STRONG.
---
And the people on the receiving end feel bullshitted.

Abusive chat: insults, harassment.

Yeah I played like 500hours of Forsaken in like a month when it first dropped.  No lifed the hell out of it.  Got 0 non quest year 2 exotics in that time.  Naturally I quit the game and haven‚Äôt been back since.  Not interested in that kind of grind. :/.
---
Another question, if i have an xbox account and a BNet account will i be able to play my xbox account (with discontinued gear) and keep all of my DLC and season pass that i have on BNet or will i have to repurchase?

Especially when you need the Heroic for a quest.

Yesterday I had that issue, as if the mouse keep slipping to the bottom right.

I thought it was more of the mouse surface area, then noticed it‚Äôs not happening in my second monitor, restarting the game seem to have fixed it, and tbh I have no idea what and why it happened.

I can‚Äôt. If you have a job, do it.

[An annual pass guide!](https://old.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bysakp/so_you_just_got_the_annual_pass_and_dont_know/)

In short, do what your quests tell you, they are meant to introduce the new activities. However, after the initial introductory quests, the annual pass will cease holding your hand and it can take a bit of time to figure things out.
---
A real solid tip is waiting for LoW to be patched. Noticing tons of more LoW apes as I'm trying to drop my glory back down. Also the usual, lfg a chill group and stick together. I have social anxiety thangs and finding a non toxic group for me was a bit of a pain but they ARE out there. You don't need to be the best, just not the dumbest and you'll get it. Good luck :)

My sweatiest moment in PvE was trying to beat a blueberry to proc heroic before he killed the prisoner. Prisoner literally had almost no health when I managed to do it. Only time I wished D2 had open world pvp so I could smack that blueberry for fucking up.

That's the reason I use triple jump and never use the others, so that in case this shit happens I can still survive

*laughs sadly in middletree arcstaff*
---
I guess his point is that LoW is not as prevalent on consoles. Just my assumption though.
---
I like arcstrider and liar‚Äôs handshake because I can tell titans to fuck off whenever they punch me
---
This is why Public Events, along with Gambit, need a **mandatory** tutorial before participation is allowed. Then we know for sure if the player is throwing the Heroic or the match just to be a dick.
---
Public Events should also have a safeguard mechanic that becomes available at the 15 seconds mark to instantly activate the Heroic when some douche comes in throw it because they just *need* to demonstrate for everyone how "powerful" they are.
---
You buy the complete collection to have everything released up until now and you ~~buy~~ pre-order Shadowkeep to be able to enjoy that in September. This also comes with season passes for season 9-11.
---
I fucking hate failsafe she is so anoying
---
Yeah, I only get duplicates from the weapons even though I have 30 left to get I‚Äôm lucky that I don‚Äôt get duplicate armour and I haven‚Äôt gotten an exotic (that wasn‚Äôt from a quest or X≈´r) since forsaken.
---
Shit‚Äôs wack, yo
---
IMO, top tree gg is the best, then bb, then arcstrider. Bb is a better panic/shutdown super that tether.
---
The transfer from bnet to steam will include everything already on bnet. The only difference is that you will launch the game from steam instead of bnet.
---
ooooohhh oooooohhhhhhh
---
BUM BUUUUM bum bum BUUM BUUM BUUUUM
---
You need to get to level 50 and complete all story missions through forsaken
---
a fellow For Honor player? noice
---
Well I‚Äôm not only talking crucible because I feel arcstider can‚Äôt compare to taking out supers like BB can but in terms of ad clear I think it is much better
---
It's game of thrones.
---
It‚Äôs fine I guess, although tether does just as well, but makes more orbs and with Orpheus, gets 50-100% super back instantly.
---
Good luck even trying to even get a public event to start on Mars.
---
I thought I was on r/animemes for a second
---
Once its upgraded they no longer drop you get runes instead
---
But with way of the current my melee can take out the same # of enemies as my tether can if you time the melee right

Yeah, I had a 4 streak going and got dropped into a game that my team lost 120-40 before I even fully loaded in.  That's just life as a solo.  Been that way since destiny1 day 1.
---
Yea hunters have the worst time against that gun. You can‚Äôt really slide under it most times unless they‚Äôre midair, and it will still track through jumps sometimes.
---
To be fair, I do love you.
---
Thats fair, I tend to play in the mid range which might be why I've not noticed needing a sniper. Though I do get killed by a lot of people running Lord of Wolves, and as I'm new I still don't know why people hate that weapon.
---
I honestly haven't switched from Ace to my secondary ever in PvP so far lol
---
The stats on that ship are op
---
Forsaken is and has been $40. Recently they threw in the base game, CoO, Warmind, and the Annual Pass for no extra charge. Very cool of them. If you want Forsaken, buy it and thank bungie for being nice and giving you the AP for free.
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard‚Äù 
---
fuck no.
---
More like ‚Äúit takes getting used to so I only tried it for one game.‚Äù
---
When forsaken released I used the hell out of that gun, then I moved back to my regular exotics (riskrunner, borealis, outbreak) and it was amazing, easily the best shotgun of the time back then.
---
Isn't that the guy who got banned for doing so? lmao
---
It‚Äôs hard to use a gun that nobody used for a while after they got it
---
Hell yeah!

No just someone in charge of this sight thank you

The recommended light level always says it‚Äôs whatever your level is if it‚Äôs above the one listed.  I think (someone feel free to correct me) 30 levels above recommended give you the biggest advantage, after that, power level won‚Äôt affect your damage.  The forges are pretty hard to solo no matter what light level.  Just keep going into matchmaking or find an lfg chat to find 2 others to help.  3 man forge with more than recommended light is not super hard, so you should be able to do it first try! Good luck :)

Void energy OR hand cannons, just use a service revolver and graviton and you'll be good.

You need to run it when the ogre is the boss which will july 2nd

Shoulder charge needs to be really close and the only actually good one us arc meanwhile the entire meta works against them

I personally don't like the Duke. I don't know what it is about it that bothers the shit out of me it just does. I'm definitely grinding for a good austringer. I want to replace my better devils from forsaken. Did you get a rampage spec for your austringer or would you recommend something else?

Was it machine gun reserves? Machine gun reserves disappearing is a known bug, we just have to wait for a bug fix.

It‚Äôs because some people are trying to get all the armor in one week even though we have all season AFAIK.

Still, and considering it should only take you like one or two shots to kill most enemies the 4 amo that the souls provide seem more than enough. I really like Thorn as as. I would really only fiddle with stats not the perks or effects

Yup that too. Only 5 matches a week for me

Repost.

How are you with a hand cannon in general? Do you have one you like ? I've used a Duke 44 and a crimson on different characters and ran in a team game behind people just picking off shots. Yeah it's cheap and they're your meat shield but its crucible.
---
What sniper is this?
---
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS GUARDIAN
---
Thank you for being the top comment
---
I agree. This has been one of my favorite Iron Banner events. People need to stop treating the game like it's crack cocaine and enjoy it. Rather than fiend and frustrate themselves trying to do too much in a week.
---
Great im still not gonna go downvote
---
Yes. All annual pass content will remain. I actually just got the annual pass for my brother because I thought it was worth him getting all of the extra added content
---
Only have two really, the Ikelos one from the quest and the Sunshot, although it's not at my light level any more, I like HC in general and can get a few kills in the crucible, it's the precision bit that is providing difficult right now.
---
Dose that actually work.....

I have a swarm with spike, snapshot, and rampage... Is that a god roll?

I just picked up the the quest last night. I'll get as far as I can today and tomorrow. Quest lasts all season so I'll be chilling

---
I don‚Äôt get it why are people downvoting this
---
I absolutely love the fact that people are willing to teach me in raids. I don't have a lot of raid experience but I watch strategy guides dozens of times before going into it. The one thing I can do and try to help with as much as possible is whisper or outbreak or just anything like that since it's simple enough for me to help with.

Also hunters: *complains about Titan‚Äôs shoulder charge abilities even though they‚Äôre the least picked class and in a shotgun/submachine meta*

I suggest you reread the vows lore page. He literally gave his hand to anyone who gets the bow

You can only have one forge quest at a time the order of forges unlocked are volunteer, gofannon, izinagi, then Burgusia but burgusia is auto unlocked for everyone and it‚Äôs the best and easiest forge

Yes.

Cuz who needs more than a hundred a week.

You should turn them in before you get the armor pieces, as the armor is only added to the random loot pool after you unlock the first piece from the quest line
---
Can‚Äôt get kill clip tho only damage perk is rampage
---
i just looked it up and i‚Äôm afraid i can‚Äôt

it‚Äôs one every 3 weeks and i don‚Äôt have enough time to get all the lore to get the pin ;(

So if you're going for God roll weapons turn in your tokens before doing the armor questline

Just bang them in bud, R&amp;G will do the rest.

realizing? I think you would know if you knew what to do before you went in lol

It's Pikachu!

Yeah I agree I didn‚Äôt want to know what Riven looked like before doing the raid but after hearing some stories about the mechanical complexity I decided to have a look.
---
It is one of my favorites and I have been playing ever since the game came out
---
Mine is a potentially popular opinion:
---
I would pay AAA price for an expansion that let play the remastered D1 raids
---
Never raided and probably never will
---
Titan... shoot gun? No, titan punch!
---
And regardless, he is now the Hunter Vanguard. Ugh. I'm a hunter main. I second the motion to have every Hunter shove Spectral Blades up his ass, furthermore I invite the Titans with their flaming hammers, and the Warlocks with their Nova Bombs. But you guys go after we do, we have first dibs.
---
which mission
---
I was playing menagerie and one (exotic engram) fell off the side of the floor and I couldn't get to it, meanwhile it ended up at the postmaster. Thank God.
---
Talk about inflation
---
Considering they change how your strats are? Yes. This isn't Y1 where all weapons were the same and if you didn't have them it was due to RNG/Not being bothered to farm them out. 
---
Then I'd agree. Exotics are _nice_ but not required. But then Bungo turns around and puts out pvp purples that are _as good if not better_ than exotics. You can't tell me the Recluse doesn't absolutely smoke the Riskrunner.

Perfection

never mind, got it!

Pretty much

Literally everyone in my D2 discord agrees that warlocks are OP beyond belief. Even the warlock players.
