Oooo is that the armour set from Sloane?
---
---
---
Yeah. It was kinda stupid.
---
You can at best 2 man many encounters in the d2 raids but otherwise no, there aren't any full raids you can solo
---
scrubs be scrubbin!
---
The game starts fun, then after a short time you realise there really isnt any point to anything you do. Your power is always capped so light level is meaningless if you're above it, but god forgive if you're a few below bc everything will destroy you. The devs have 0 creativity so everything is just stale af and there is 0 end game at all
---
Powerful.
---
Not on ps4 you aint
---
Not really.. Whats not fair is spec blades that can wipe a team twice, sentinel shields that can wipe 3 - 4 people with 1 throw... The list goes on
---
The hardcore feel of PvE makes Destiny, to me, feel more like an MMO than before, so I like that.
---
Thank you very much!
---
I'm trying to post more around here for you guys :) I don't post as often as I should. And thanks!
---
I completely forgot that going to shuro is more efficient for farming kills than leviathan, since you can put a raid banner and such
---
Why are u so perfect? Can I use this for wallpaper? Why am I asking such questions? I don't have time to explain what I don't have time to explain.
---
They probably won't lmao they've featured a bunch of my stuff in the past and they probably want a wider variety of artists. I'm glad you like it though! :)
---
Pics or lies. Jk, I believe you. I saw a Chronicler earlier in DC today. I finally unlocked Cursebreaker myself, and I'm focusing on getting those last 5 lore books done for the Chronicler seal myself. It's definitely a hard one to get and I would be honored to have it. Wayfarer is going to get dusty on my shelf.
---
I'm very glad to hear that my work is enjoyed :)
---
Imagine needing cooperation to finish an objective in a team based raid
---

---
Who would have thought
---
This one's been on the list since we started talking about the rat.
---
I did it with top tree arc strider, arc bolt grenade and the grenade tonic. 
---
My weapon loadout was Pulse Rifle, Retold Tale and Tractor Cannon
---
Then at the final ‚Äústage‚Äù I swapped TC for 1k Voices. 
---
Strats are to throw lots of grenades (definitely helps to have Ashes to Assets headgear), dodge, melee something, dodge, melee, dodge, melee, dodge, super? Destroy everything (but focus on the yellow bar enemies)
---
I also swapped Lucky Raspberry to Raiden Flux for when I used my super. 
---
PC if that matters.
---
We dps it for better loot. Doesn‚Äôt work though.
---
They did in D1, just like Magnetic grenades and the solar Warlock nades
---
The catalysts (but not faction rallies themselves) are planned to come back next season according to either DMG or Cozmo's twitter.
---
r/destiny2
---
What shader are you using?
---
now git guud and join the real gamers with rivensvane
---
Really?? That sucks! I guess I will bring my character over to D2 and play. Kept grinding cause I thought you could earn a few. 
---
Thanks for the feedback :)
---
Yeah but I'm pretty sure they still have their aim assist on, just as the other grenades still have theirs
---
I agree
---
How would you know that *rubs at nose*
---
Why?
---
I'm pretty sure they don't. And I don't think any other nades do besides fusions.  
---
Skip tracking is like godtier compared to fusion too lol.
---
I can help out. I've helped out multiple new players@

sounds like my comp teammates
---
Does that snake have hair on it lol
---
-_-
---
My pals and I just do it for fun no particular reason
---
$5 gets patrons access to all of our HD digital work
---
Want that damn ikelos sg
---
Great! Thank you!
---
Handling MW is also never a bad choice. Obviously there are better options there but for PvE it would work just fine
---
It does :) its the drifter XD
---
Lemme have it shhh it's different and has lots of upvotes
---
im not saying your that teammate, but its what i get
---
Oh! Nice lmao
---
Anythings possible Guardian!
---
Thanks!
---
Good luck man!
---
First need ship then i do Petras
---
most of my Massacres were thanks to Riskrunner.
---
;)
---
Congratulations! I‚Äôve been trying to help my mom get it for weeks now and we are still trying!
---
Really ? Explain the the technique/ method, and did u have a team?
---
You haven‚Äôt faced a titan titan with ursas on then have you
---
Hey man me too makes the game even better
---
very scary
---
Waiting for my ship before i do the Petras. Not letting a Cosmetic hold me back from a Title.
---
Shrouded Stripes!
---
And they say that chivalry is dead!
---
Shrouded Stripes! Thanks!
---
He's met the devil and caved his fucking skull in.
---
:)
---
Yes, PVE makes up most of the game. But if are the kind of guy that like collect guns no matter that effectivness in PVE or PVP then you are fk if you suck at PVP.
---
Right now bungie introduce a few good weap lock behind PVP to entice free meat for comp.
---
Don‚Äôt worry, The next expansion doesn‚Äôt come until at least July or something
---
I can't roll my eyes much harder than I just did. But I'll try again just for that name.
---
Lmao facts
---
Yeah, and I suck and never did it, and I soloed that fucker with a warlock.
---
Was that bottom tree it lagged when u hit greg
---
):
---
I‚Äôd make a quip about this dude having too much time on his hands but i feel like he‚Äôll break me in half if i do.
---
I paused it to show damage.
---
Thank you kindly brother! I'm sure your chars look awesome too!
---
Don't want to break your bubble BUT... people that are good PVP are inherently good at PVE because aiming, movement, ability to use cover, awareness, and so on. So you think you&lt;re a beast in PVE!?!?
---
It's funny how many people say that, I actually only play at nights and spent my days studying/working/with my girl lmao just focused on my achievements when I am in game haha - but yes my Titan would break us both in half.
---
12k nice
---
Nice that's alot of kills
---
122k :D
---
I wish it did.  Just finished run #78 of Strange Terrain, still no Osprey. heading to bed, will try again tomorrow.
---
It depends on the level of detail, but this:
---
https://www.artstation.com/artwork/QznAEd
---
Took me about 7 hours.
---
This:
---
https://www.artstation.com/artwork/xGz3m
---
took me 4 hours.
---
And This:
---
https://www.artstation.com/artwork/L2m9Qw
---
took me around 15 hours.
---
Yes. It's my favorite fps along with borderlands.  They give you challenges while still making you feel powerful.
---
Lol my bad I'm blind that's even more crazy
---
Sexy Yellow Engrams...I always take a moment before I pick one up ü§§
---
This can be interpreted in a very wrong way if people don‚Äôt understand the context
---
RHOMBUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!  NOOOOOOOO
---
holy, well after 300hrs of activities i still dont have a single seal (only need to prestige 2 more times for dredgen)
---
tlw just got kick back like a mad donkey, that‚Äòs the gun. it‚Äòs dead accurate when hitting hip fire shots in a row. that‚Äòs the perk. ace is accurate, the bloom isn‚Äòt even noticable when testing at a wall and even less when testing on a real target because of the high range stat and bullet magnetism.
---
I'd never use a scout though.
---
They're not in a good place right now.
---
If I *had* to use a scout, I'd choose Polaris Lance.
---
You were able to lag to get thru the window as well.  They got serious the next week and started Banning people.  Good times.
---
PS4. I‚Äôve had instances where one of my teammates called me shit at invading because I took his invades, an enemy called me trash because he mapped me with a J√∂tunn in the first 5 seconds of my invade once, picking up ‚Äòmotes that weren‚Äôt mine‚Äô, etc.
---
Coincidentally, it happens mainly in gambit prime. And some people seem to believe that having a full set of glowing armor makes them a god at the game.
---
Wait, that's illegal.
---
Molesto?
---
Nice work, welcome to the 200k+ Titan‚Äôs club
---
It turned them into pesto.
---
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve Got A Friend In Me‚Äù plays in the background
---
But.. but.. there's a "Competitive" playlist!
---
I‚Äôm right there with you. Currently at 1854 and nervous as hell to lose it...but you can‚Äôt win if you don‚Äôt play. You‚Äôve got this!
---
I did this so many times
---
Lol and you hear them get mad as they fail for the third time.
---
The Dapperone is no nice guy, look closely, that's a bowler hat.
---
When your internet decides to pass out, the second crota dies.
---
I can't beat the shit out of you without getting closer!
---
Muda muda muda muda!
---
I refuse
---
Not using capture card just Xbox record it doesn‚Äôt record party chat
---
I love this shotgun, I wish you could get crucible kill counter on it.
---
kaballin
---
Doomfang is really ugly :( it looks like it was designed by a 12yr old. I love the perks but I hate wearing it
---
Yess but sunshot is bae
---
Lmao. Had that happen to a teammate in vault during a petras run. Good times.
---
Yes.
---
Yep, found a 6000 strong guild (Shrouded) with 20 clans in pc and my overnight work schedule means there is still no one to run shit with unless I use EU servers and my ping will be atrocious. Trying guided games at 7am is like pulling teeth, still haven't managed a full raid group.
---
Yeah man without a clan with some dedicated raiders you will struggle it‚Äôs hard with lfg as it‚Äôs very random sometimes it‚Äôs great other times it‚Äôs really bad so YouTube and pray is about all I can come up with.
---
‚ÄúSometimes the greatest revenge is to simply persist. Finish them.‚Äù
---
AND THEN HE FINISHES THEM.
---
Hello notify gang
---
The Fedorone
---
Sorry, does it have to be any sniper? or is it just precision kills? so you could do it with HC precision kills?
---
I counted five, might be six though. Gonna try 69 just to be safe.
---
Gonna try 7. U know. Bungie loves 7.
---
See I somehow manage to miss things that don‚Äôt move so I‚Äôm weak in both
---
That‚Äôs 100% a titan ghost.
---
Alright thanks.
---
The Iron Banana is here
---
HAHAHAHAHA that one is great!
---
Did you capture objective A?
---
What did it cost?
---
Power ammo, Objective B, C and 3 lives.
---
If you get the drop on someone, and miss the shot, you didn't deserve the kill in the first place. Part of getting better is controlling guns. People flock to easier to use guns for this reason, but harder to use guns aren't worthless, they just require more effort to use. If you don't like using 110 handcannons, then don't. Try using a different loadout if it isn't working for you.
---
I would love it so much if the Raids were soloable in D2. I hate having to play with so many people.
---
I think there are at least 2, possibly 3. And they are class exclusive. I got lucky first try with the warlock horns as I use warlock by far the most.
---
***laughs in malf addiction***
---
lol, nobody (that I‚Äôm aware of) was banned for the crota kneel glitch. 
---
sauce of bans?
---
That video just broke my brain..... I‚Äôm not even mad, I‚Äôm impressed
---
Sorry, I got excited
---
To be fair, EVERYONE Solo‚Äôs crota after we became wayyyyyy stronger than that raid. 
---
GGs tho!
---
if you happen to have a helmet with handcannon targeting (or even the enhaced)
---
it help a ton! gets pretty snappy \^\^
---
I might send you a friend request.
---
I afk rumble all the time, usually when I sleep or work just for the enhancement cores
---
Second valakydyn. Been very good to me as a secondary to my AoS
---
*titan main* I already did
---
Good luck with it! Hope you get there soon then unleash in quickplay!
---
That and.... just straight up running a dust rock blues and a Luna‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt hurt, or dust rock trust, or dust rock with distant relation, or dust rock with pretty much anything really, point is, you should get a god rolled dust rock first
---
Origin story is also great in PvP as well, but not as good as the Valakadyn
---
Suggest you check out r/CruciblePlaybook for helpful advise on weapons and basic strategy.
---
Also the revelry is on for the next couple of weeks and the tonics are allowing people to spam grenades and abilities which is not the norm, just an FYI.
---
It was in a twab like a month or 2 ago
---
Sweet business
---
If you are average or below, PVP is no fun in this game. if you are good and can get the Pinnacle weapons... You'll have more fun. Otherwise, you'll always be fighting a losing battle.
---
Thanks mate, wish there was a better way :(
---
You'll probably be seeing these weapons a lot: Luna's Howl, Not Forgotten, and The Recluse.
---
These are 'Pinnacle' PVP weapons. Only aquired in the Competitive playlist.
---
Basically, you have to win Comp games to get these, with a few other steps. But it's extremely difficult to win your Comp matches when everyone else had them and you don't. There aren't really counters to them. It's a terrible loop.
---
You want to improve in PVP to get these weapons, but can't, as you're constantly being killed by them.
---
This it's my experience PVP. Competitive and Quickplay.
---
Umm, ok, its 360RPM and has the impact of a 720RPM, and its other stats are garbage except for the hidden stats.
---
Thats actually disgusting. :/
---
This. I'll use random weapons that my friends say is trash but honestly if I can wreck with it and I like it then it's a good weapon. Rolls and playstyle.
---
go for it!
---
Ty!
---
I solo'd up to 2500 Glory using a very similar setup (Blast Furnace/Jotunn/Hammerhead). The only thing I would recommend is using Dawnblade (I prefer bottom tree). You can fly all over to take out a whole team quickly and still shutdown other roaming supers.
---
I run it regardless
---
Oh. I gotcha
---
Downvoted then upvoted
---
1000% agree with the early morning. I would get about 3 games in before work and it was almost always 8 lone rangers.
---
Yea, this is why I don't feel bad when I kill Psions and Cabal. They're so ugly that death is an improvement.
---
I'm not sure if the Redrix's weapons are relevant anymore.
---
I don't actually have either, so I can't say.
---
A good Blast Furnace roll will absolutely destroy.
---
Pulse rifles are *extremely* easy to use. Probably one of easiest.
---
Any recommendations for people without the annual pass?
---
F
---
Probably shouldn‚Äôt be invading if you can‚Äôt kill anyone ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Basically
---
That shader is perfect. I wish it applied better to weapons instead of turning it blue.
---
Collector I can't recommend anything, thats just down to yourself. Reaper I used pulse nades and Riskrunner for the Massacres, for Sentry i used Jotunn to nail the Blockers alone, for Invader i used Ward Of Dawn on their bank! Keep at it, takes a grind but it's worth it! GL!
---
Nice! 
---
Actually got it yesterday as well! The shader didnt look as cool in orbit imo tho :( but still very bad ass ship
---
Warriors don't need to look like they're wearing battle armor all the time, though. Besides, they're warlocks. They may not be casting doom bolts at everything, but the class has roots in classic spellcasting tropes.
---
I think the sets generally look alright, with a few exceptions (I don't really like any of the armor sets were bits look tattered and worn). Ultimately, armor isn't going to please everyone as it's a very subjective topic for everyone.
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 13.
---
/r/DestinySherpa.
---
I was looking up some information on this too in regards to how to climb the ranks. I read that after getting a streak in quickplay or rumble go into competitive where you won't lose your streak with a loss.  
---
Is this actually true? 
---
Obviously getting the streak first is a bit RNG as a solo player but seems doable and rewarding if the streak doesn't go away in comp for faster glory from a win? Or does a win or loss always give or take the same amount of glory no matter the streak only basing it on your current glory rank?
---
I just did mine last weekend as Amazon had a crazy SanDisk sale so I got a 480gb with external case for $58. Made a huge difference in load times. More than I expected.
---
I do notice more lag now when in game but that is probably just Spectrum being fucksticks.
---
Yo how tf did y‚Äôall get that warlock shit on yo name
---
Damn dude. You got any other clips. That was ickity siiick
---
WITCHCRAFT!!!
---
Oh I'm going to try but the hardest part is finding a good group.
---
God name for sure lol
---
Correction* Your team can‚Äôt do anything.
---
I'll keep grinding for sure but I'm avoiding solo runs right now.
---
Seems like a small price to pay for always breaking the game
---
That's what I'm shooting for this week
---
Ty ty!
---
I really like full auto for sidearms. My SW has full auto, rampage and range mw.
---
Thanks guys!  I was considering using the well of radiance but I know I‚Äôm using my lock so I‚Äôll probably try a few things.  With the revelry going on just thought this would be a good time to finally try.
---
Those were the days.
---
I know what will fix this. More bonuses for executives.
---
And my Groot
---
Holy shit.
---
I bet I look like a Destiny toddler to you.
---
Peters ghost is and always will be better than nolands
---
lol some laugh
---
Oh that one, shit if I can find it ill link it.
---
It's really good for taking down other supers now.
---
With how it now increases damage done to a single target if you keep tickling it.
---
The grenade for top tree is a reason itself to use it.
---
Hey im a sherpa‚Äôs assistant, I have the right sir. (This is gauntlet right?)
---
Hahahahaha, no please no.
---
They‚Äôre great for pve esp w the revelry grenade juice rn. You can carry t3 reckoning w this combo alone. I think it‚Äôs worth mentioning that frisbees only need to hit (not kill) for the super extension. I also highly recommend mid tree sentinel to have a source of healing (void detonators) while you spam frisbees. 
---
For pvp, i think neutral game exotics are more attractive since you only get about 2 supers per match. However, The super energy gained from melee kills is like 20-25% of the super bar which is pretty massive, so you prob can squeeze in more supers if you can get a good amt of void melee kills (not always guaranteed tho esp against shotguns).
---
Ehhh i dunno bout that one
---
I know it‚Äôs not great but I‚Äôm kinda proud of it.
---
√úBER-REDUNGS-KUNSTLER
---
Get Nathan Fillion to do it.
---
2 manned shattered throne with a randomer yeaterday, only need this for cursebreaker, what drops???........motherfucking sniper rifle!! Ironically i feel like i cant break the curse of bad RNG
---
Yes
---
Shotguns don't bother me. They work as intended.
---
All I'm saying is *based on my experience* Luna's and NF were a huge nuisance.
---
They also have a nearly impenetrable shield that can block some of the strongest weapons in the game.
---
Not destiny, but recently playing war thunder, captured c, then captured b, then my team lost c, so I went there, killed all the enemy and capped c, and then the same happened at b, the entire game I was doing that, we eventually won, but it was a kill win, not a cap win, mostly because my team was full of idiots
---
Quite impressive
---
If you have discord, there is a destiny 2 channel that includes everything from destiny fashion to lfg to clan recruitment. Includes all platforms as well. You could try looking there.
---
But it makes enemies panic more when shooting you,making them more prone to missing and giving him a better chance,OEM isn't a straight boost,it's a psycological weapon
---
Didnt know there was a cap on it. Even if you cant its not like it changes much you can just make the same character again.
---
131 headshot
---
There's an infographic that you can look at here -&gt; https://destinynewshub.com/guide/destiny-2-annual-pass-in-depth-roadmap-analysis/
---
The Forsaken Annual Pass unlocks a bunch of stuff before those who have the "free" version of the game. It's worth it if there's only a $5 EUR difference, because you get access to things like the Thorn Quest, the Invitations of the Nine which is the lore books for Xur and the Nine, and get access to things like some weapon and armor that the "free" version does not. The roadmap in the article I linked shows a breakdown of what you get and what you don't.
---
You have to be on the same profile as the old character. Your characters should show up on the start screen as max level only as the game loads for the first time on that profile. The only difference is that some voice lines change. For example ghost didn't know who Rasputin was or what a warmind was and there was some dialogue explaining it.
---
I mean dreaming city‚Äôs revery dawn armor does make titans look like knights kinda.
---
Whats the question?
---
Caught in a landslide
---
The reason for the cap was the limited time achievements (Moments of Triumph) associated with your account being transferred over, and Veteran status which altered some of the dialogue in D2. And the ‚Äòmemory highlights‚Äô icon at character select. Otherwise, there is no real reason to transfer over, as nothing of real value would transfer over besides appearance.
---
Memes aren't supposed to be funny, or now is just about complaining?
---
