I always report teabaggers for abusive chat.
---
Its an overcomplicated method but if you use DIM you can pull things from one inventory to another and claim postmaster stuff. If I were you I'd try and keep at least 1 space on each slot free so you can claim items you missed and trash them if they suck.
---
Yeah I got a ps4.
---
no
---
I'd definitely recommend it. You don't necessarily need the dlcs to have a good time in the game-- there's plenty to do and explore!
---
Wrong, Siva was DISCOVERED by humans
---
I found the bow precision kills so easy, and the hand cannon. The real struggle now Telesto has been disabled is getting Fusion Multikills.
---
I'm having the same problem. killed all ads, blue door, sound effect and still won't open.
---
Lol that won‚Äôt do anything
---
Meh, I‚Äôve never used it but I can understand and value it‚Äôs practical application. It just seems like a reasonable quality of life update to ask for.
---
You get the quest from ikora check the quest tab maybe u didn't notice it but you need to kill 3 vex invasion bosses and kill a bunch of vex
---
That makes sense. Most opponents, in general, were either playing medium range or trying to shotgun. The ability to disengage becomes much more important when in hand cannon/shotgun range. With scout rifles, it doesn't really matter as much as just shooting them without range dropoff.

Looks like cabbage to me. I like cabbage.

Man, Gambit got a *lot* more dangerous with the addition of Ninjas in Shadowkeep
---
Ouch. What happened?
---
I fr have seen ‚Äúget recluse for $300‚Äù ads before on destiny sites. I feel thats not only stupid but removes the point of getting the gun.
---
Beat me to it
---
Someone did this to me on the moon while I was doing the tire game. Feelsbadman.
---
What‚Äôs an lfg
---
Ho-lee shnickels...
---
See? No one ever expects the offensive tether
---
&gt; yes it‚Äôs chaining is strong (and getting nerfed rightfully so, along with bottom striker) bit what else does it offer
---

---
The fastest movement speed of any super and extremely generous tracking on projectiles? Please do not pretend that bottom tree Dawnblade is not one of the best supers in PvP.
---
So in other words this still hasnt been fixed ? (I've had this issue the last two seasons)
---
You can't really farm exotics, but I've heard gambit and strikes have higher drop chances
---
do they turn pink when they kill you?
---
I used to use an AMD Radeon 7870 HD 2GB of  Vram, it sadly died during my playtime on Destiny, and thus it had to be put to pasture, So i had to go back to my Gforce 740 SC 4GB.  
---
I used to get like 60 FPS now i get between 9 and 25...  
---
I have to use the 740 until i get the 970 i have lined up, hopefully saturday i get it, or else i'm fucking breaking this 740...
---
Wouldn‚Äôt work on d2 on console, at 72 fov it still struggles to stay at 30fps and some activities can‚Äôt handle 30 fps, like doing more than 2 phases on the last boss I‚Äôm GoS. Bungie can‚Äôt do anything about console fov, it‚Äôs the hardware on consoles that‚Äôs holding it back
---
The Colony is what you want. That's as close as your gonna get.
---
STOP YELLING. Exotics can drop from anywhere. Gambit, strikes, crucible, menagerie, the vex thing shit loot so go hog wild
---
thanks still kinda new just ran with a 920 friend for a while and got some stuff
---
[deleted]
---
Oh jeez, that's rough. So I should expect something similar this coming week unless I'm incredibly lucky again. I got 2 pieces of 952 gear so far and still have the raid, nightmare hunt to go for this weeks pinnacle gear.
---
I see the mods but arent mod components really rare
---
I‚Äôm hoping cayde ends up as a boss and the tower gets destroyed and taken over and we get a new base of operations and can visit the destroyed tower on the edz somehow. Or make it a strike
---
I got one with feeding frenzy and rampage before shadowkeep
---
As a titan I cant beat the shit out of you unless I get closer
---
I don't know what the deal is with the matchmaking. I've been in games with  five people sporting Pinnacle weapons and I've never gotten more than 1000 glory in a season before this one. 
---
I started this season like 2 and 12 in comp. I was the worst player in almost every game I played. I almost gave up completely for the season and thought people were full of crap that it was 'so easy' this season. 
---
Then, two days ago, I tried again and I couldn't lose. Went on 5 game win streaks and got the fabled with almost no effort whatsoever in a handful of hours. I was usually the second best player on each of the games and even carried one or two.
---
I have no idea what the difference was.
---
Except for maybe the Sticky nade in the Arcstrider, that thing deals pretty good damage if you can land it
---
I approve fellow hunter
---
Last I checked, sheep fear the Welsh more.
---
Once upon time there were the arena and our RMP best PvP i i have played
---
I want this. Some low rarity armor sets are actually cool.
---
There's a reason Welsh men wear kilts:
---
Sheep can hear zippers
---
Even for some endgame content it‚Äôs good. Two or three people using it absolutely destroy bosses.

What the hell did I just watch?

No, it happens every 25 motes if there's between 20 and 24 5 motes will open a portal
---
#WHOOOO! ***THE BEST GUNFIGHTS HAPPEN ON THE FRONTIER!!***
---
There is also 1 on IO that has a chance to spawn. I've only seen it a few times in my 400+ hours of playtime.
---
BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!!! BOOONUS DAMAAAGE
---
It has an area of effect effect huh?
---
I haven't been doing Ordeals, but that does sound incredibly useful in that scenario. 
---
Outside of stunning champions and actually bullying smaller enemies I do believe Leviathans Breath is the kind of exotic you adapt your play to it rather than just slotting it and expecting amazing results. 
---
Another example of an exotic weapon you do that with would be Sweet Business. Sure it's fine on its own but once you start to take advantage of build options on armor and other weapons it becomes a far superior play style.
---
3 clears, 14 pairs of boots and curated pulse rifle.
---
lol get nae nae‚Äôd losers
---
My intellect 100 titan would like a word with you.
---
I appreciate the addition of Randy.
---
I'm in the teens and still haven't even smelled one. C'mon RNG.
---
Titan on the right. "Who the fuck are you?" One on the left. "Who the fuck are you?"
---
apparently a cheat that respawns the person immediately after death in the same location.  ran into it once during iron banner.
---
Read the first to lines of my post bud. Not the first two sentences, mind you, the first two lines. Clearly says I progressed 0% after 7 games while already having 79%. And there isn‚Äôt a way for you to judge my crucible skill based off of my bugged quest line so don‚Äôt even try with that crap.
---
Yeah I thought it might have extra damage but couldn't remember and didn't want to give false info, thanks for update :)
---
He was on earlier talking about his name lol
---
Eww

Shhhhhhh, don‚Äôt tell people about uggler smay ord way

And good luck with savathuns strike, rather run a marathon in sandpaper underwear

That efficiency is impressive haha

No, it's a joke that lord of wolves is a pulse rifle.               R/whoosh
---
If you're wanting xp to level up the season pass and your artifact just do a ton of bounties.
---
If you're wanting to increase your power level just collect gear until your reach 900 power level, then do everything that says powerful gear.
---
If you want good weapons, look at the menagerie and black armory, and maybe try to grind out a pinnacle weapon or two.
---
HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH THIS IS THE 37TH FUNNIEST TIME IVE SEEN THIS TODAY!

AFAIK nothing indicates Guardians are even capable of reproduction. And honestly, 
---
&gt; What's scary is you would never know.
---
kinda means it wouldn't matter anyhow.
---
its a bug
---
Celestial?? In PVP???
---
Thanks for the info! I will keep grinding to power level 900 then do more challenging stuff. I will take your advice on the menagerie and black armory.  Helpful, appreciate it!
---
Ah, yes, that explains the Jade Rabbit, the odd/jerky camera movement, and the video quality of 1968.
---
Don't bother reading it unless you intend to cross save between platforms. Just accept it, it doesn't really matter.
---
What if I want to cross save, but I haven‚Äôt yet. Should I still accept?
---
You can now link you PS4/XBoxone/pc together and use one set of characters on all three
---
I did a bow this week and it counted
---
They raised the diminishing return but dropped the overall kill total, but first nerf made it like 5 swords, this gives you atleast 7 kills and a better return to find the next target, but it just sets an average bar between striker and everlasting flames. So it's a bump from a huge nerf.
---
Nah
---
Whoa dude. You either get to be right or you get to be not-a-dickhead. You don't get to be both in this thread.
---
It registers and actually kills him, the guy just respawns and it's tpd to the place where he died
---
If I haven‚Äôt crossed saved yet but I want to should I accept the message?
---
People make mistakes and your idea to effectively *Delete All* will create a lot of tears
---
Some moron accidentally deleted over 500 enhancement cores last season lol
---
*Please no more shoulder charges*
---
I laughed way to fucking hard at this
---
Why is arms dealer so difficult?  Mind &amp; mobs &amp; mobs &amp; red death lights all over &amp; it takes forever to do any damage to the boss.  Light level around 912ish.
---
As I Scots-Irish I can agree to this.
---
What armor set is that? I don't recognize it.
---
lmao right? Things like Last Hope had the fastest ttks in the game back when.
---
For when you want to burn a hole through the opponent's monitor. Or, y'know, when you feel like wasting an exotic slot.
---
Also, just cuz' birb.
---
Yes
---
Ok thanks
---
LOOK AT EM NOW! _THEY'RE DEAD!!_

You know that part of the riven encounter where you have to listen closely to which side the sound is coming from? Well that sound is riven clapping her asscheeks in an attempt to seduce you to coming toward her so she can eat you.

Hey! Keep an eye on your Ghost buddy a crazed vegan might try to eat him
---
The problem here is that it doesn't mean anything. It often happens and the intruders keep coming killing the whole team to regen the primeval. It is even more true in Gambit Prime. It can be even more worst if the intruder of the winning team stop invading once the primeval has arrived....and if often happens...
---
I get what you mean, but the only real time its slightly discouraging is rumble, where their teammates cant cover while they heal that super tiny bit.
---
Have you already completed the quest and got it with another character cause you can only do it once and get it I tried with my warlock and I didn‚Äôt get it either you can acquire it through your collection though.

Thats awesome man
---
...Brick, is that you?
---
You will never get to the cap but that's not the point. The point is to give you something to grind for throughout the season because in previous seasons when people started to get to Max power there was no really no need to raids or nightfalls. But with the system people will keep grinding well into the season
---
Upvote for that small clip of Randy. Loved the few videos Ive seen of those.
---
&gt;it that‚Äôs gonna force me to keep playing it lol
---
or just stand afk in the moon hub and you'll get it when someone else does it. Source: me giving everyone the achivement after wasting 2k filaments and being a little bit upset everyone else also got it.

Where is that at? Assuming not Artifact‚Äôs Edge?

Thanks in advance :)

Thank you üòÅ

Or...you can just go to the castellum in Leviathan and get endless waves of Cabal. It‚Äôs a great place to farm any kill bounties, Banshee bounties or weapon catalyst because you never have to worry about blueberries stealing your kills.

Cool.  But why did you post this????

Lol thanks

If I had a nickel for every time I‚Äôve had a similar problem I could buy a pc and ditch my shit Xbox

It works like an ordnance, impact and paragon mod put in one, I‚Äôm assuming since it didn‚Äôt show this previously that it wouldn‚Äôt just change the stats, so its just like if you kept 1 of each mod and could still use it now.
---
I did a raid with that guy
---
I know it‚Äôs crazy and not many people know about it but there is this magical thing called google and it‚Äôs much faster and easier on everyone than making a reddit post for info that can be found in 2 seconds.

I changed the fucking words to shadow que because of the crazy que. This post was stupid nobody got it. It took me a while to font match

Ah, it's a fixed rotation then hey?

Seeing a lot of guys say to do Heroic Adventure first thing in the week/day, why is that? I cant find any good resources that clearly state this answer(google is a mess for this game, just a bunch of gaming journalist bullshit)
---
What are quests for weapons that I can passively progress in by just playing the game? Like, are there any legendary weaps that say something like 'get 100 headshots' without specifying a specific game mode?
---
Do these kills actually count?
---
Anyway, I had the game recently put an ad for the season pass in my face while fighting a boss in the ordeal. Certainly interesting stuff.
---
Yahh that was the only thing I could think of that would randomly drop his PL ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yea, that's why the majority of the community INCLUDING TITANS THEMSELVES, have all said and agree with the complaints about them being overpowered lmao. Get real kid.

Can't get it. What was it supposed to be for?

apex had the same thing right?  Thats not steam.
---
I dont think any F2P game is safe from cheaters obviously.
---
I miss Nothing Manacles
---
Op is saying hes getting drops 20 below 900 when hes at 900 if I‚Äôm interpreting that correctly, having something of lower power wouldn‚Äôt affect this.
---
Apparently cheat boosters is a thing. The cheater could be being paid to boost the other 2 guy's Glory. If you ban the cheater he'll just make a new acc. Need to have a system that can ban the "costumer" like in R6 Siege. But have a warning that if you suspect your teammate is a cheater, report him and leave.
---
Yeah hasapiko, arunak then pagouri.

Those are rewards for something in a certain period of time slightly different to the ones I‚Äôm talking about

Thank you for making this. I did a menagerie run earlier today and I was starting to think it was a bit pointless bc I wasn't getting any good stuff but now I know how to get what I want.
---
Lol i made the mistake of thinking he was talking about drops. I reread OPs post and he says his level is dropping randomly not his drops..
---
Your meme was great! I laughed harder than I should have
---
Yeah its pretty confusing lol.
---
Kinda reminds me of that one video from d1 when some guy was playing a match of crucible and popped his bladdancer to killed some guy that then ended up causing the game to bug out and instead of the game registering him killing the guy once, it registered him killing the guy 50+ times which lead to his team winning the match because of all the super kills registered. I know that's not what's happening here, but that's just what it reminded me of.
---
That was the first thing I thought about when visiting Rasputin. Can you read minds?
---
Humm...alright; When it comes down to those types...what's the most popular in the categories? Like popular hc's?

Got my freind to do a Ordeal Nightfall. I suddenly hear him scream: WHAT? WHEN DID OGERS BECOME THIS FAST. he had not been on destiny for a LONG time.

Super noon question. Where is the 4v4 rotating lobby? I thought survival was the only comp playlist.

It can be obtained fairly easily from a quest. It isn't half bad in pvp, but it can really go on a rampage in pve if you can proc arc conductor when surrounded by enemies.

I only have like... an hour of free time a night during the work week, and this was near the end of it. Was tired after a long day at work, and just kinda ran out of steam mentally. That‚Äôs no excuse because it was easy to figure out, but I was just kinda done with the day by that point. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Good to know. Thank you
---
Yeah, it probably respawns too fast for the server to register it but you can see that it actually kills him because OP is getting the medals
---
What if they die because they accidentally fell off the edge of the map? Would they just continuously respawn where they fell and die again in a never ending loop?
---
It's a lot of fun in PvE, PvP in tight spaces or if you've got a touchy enemies. I'd throw my arc gernade and walk into it a bit to get it to proc, lots of fun.

You‚Äôll likely get the boring parts of the raid (as clear), limiting your enjoyment from the raid. Not as much dead weight as people will say, but the engaging roles within raids typically need coms, unless you‚Äôre on pc and are a fast typer, but even then, I wouldn‚Äôt put someone new with only coms on those roles
---
Weird it looks like it does
---
Black scorpion is a murder machine and very forgiving. Nightwatch, mida multitool, and Jade rabbit are also very good.
---
It's a looter shooter. There are dungeons and raids as well. Basic content are quests where you go through a story mission, there are dailies such as bounties that you can complete while questing, and also quests out in the open world you pick up. Gear drops pretty often off of mobs. You can choose between 3 classes and each class has 3 talent trees. They're essentially psychic, fire, and electricity. You run around shootin people. Depending on what class and spec you are your grenade, melee, jetpack, special ability, and super ability will be different. Loot drops are also based on what gear you already own as well so you'll always be getting stronger. There's also PvP modes like death match, capture point, etc. Your gear gets normalized in PvP so you can play it and not get *completely* destroyed with new player gear.
---
I'm only missing the ship from 980 nightfall and the 3x undying mind kill (come out 11th november if i remember correctly)
---
I play on friday and barely on week days so yeah it can be done.
---
Aeyyyy I did a public event or 2 with this one, I could barely aim because I kept getting laughing fits whenever I read their name lol
---
Who wants to do all that for a scout rifle that fires the same rate as the scorpion just because it's in the genetic slot? I'm done.
---
And with low graphic settings it looks like smudged grass shit
---
You are not reading my point currently if you are losing mid range fights due to an erentil one it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs charge time is beating out your dps and two your gun doesn‚Äôt has enough impact to kill them faster than 4 fusion bolts can hit you. Point being Erentil shines because it can shoot fast, it‚Äôs made to be a mid range weapon, linear fusion rifles are made to be a long-mid range weapon. Nerf it‚Äôs charge and you effectively kill them or go long range.
---
I like red failsafe better than orange fail safe tbh. But yea default ghost is kinda meh.
---
Using oathkeeper I see. Good move.
---
Yes that tappen a few times after we lost a round i hope i can get OP to post a clip of that
---
It wasnt forgotten about, it just had no place in the meta because of auto reload in well. Izanagis still needs to go through an animation to proc honed edge which made its DPS lower to spike grenades, and with 1 phasing everything with spikes there was no need for it.
---
I can get down with that. 1100 charge?
---
That's good news at least. Guess I'll do the same! Thanks! (Mind if I ask if you did it for PS4 or PC ? I tried submitting it ingame for PS4, but couldn't see the option ? - perhaps I just log in on the website and do it from there? )
---
Thanks for answering!
---
All right, so  I'm not missing out on anything going for Legend now, and Fabled I can always redo if needed. Thanks!

And also the one small step from shadowkeep
---
If they cleanse them, they‚Äôre just the mercury weapons. Then everyone gets upset because re-skins.

Liar's handshake, top tree arc strider, thundercoil, gamblers dodge, 1-2 punch will be the best melee build again after the next reset when 1-2 punch/greaves get's nerfed and Titans are supposed to be about punching things.

---
Thanks
---
Thank you
---
Trick 4, get your own oem
---
just let us buy a random weapons for 100 components.. i dont care about them or the weapons even i just want to clean my inventory and postmaster
---
This is literally one google-search away from anyone, but okey.
---
What would be a god roll on it?
---
PC Master Race.
---
Vex Mythoclast??
---
Actual story
---
I‚Äôm not OP :p
---
Anyone seen that Cammy video where he throws one grenade and gets marked x4?
---
I think its divinity not coldheart
---
The armor ane weapons from this season are dope!
---
they don‚Äôt count after the match ended, this was fixed a while ago in SoO
---
Liek purpl crayen taste good
---
I think hand cannons are in a good place. Their meant for close-mid range dueling and I think they fit that role quite nicely. This is coming from someone who uses luna's pretty often so take it for what it's worth.
---
TACTICAL NUKE, INCOMMING
---
By matching the effect of ace to thorn and lumina, do you mean that the pick up buff would stay until the gun is switched or it is used??
---
You are gay
---
‚ÄúSo anyways, I started blasting‚Äù
---
New player here, pretty cool game so far :)
---
I played the Red War campaign now, what should be my next goal now? (dont have the paid DLCs)
---
another question: what in hell does calibrate a weapon stand for? like in some bounties
---
Okay what if nobody wants to play with a shitty legendary hand cannon in his kinetic slot this week and perhaps want to use say a thorn? You're right you can do just fine but it's not about doing fine, it's about being free what to use and still being efficient in taking down champions. That's my whole point.
---
I mean... the guy is a berserker after all... they don‚Äôt need brains, just the ability to punch hard enough that what it fights, dies.
---
So instead of picking up the buff and the timer starts have it as soon as you kill or maybe to balance get a headshot kill the buff procs and it just stays similar to how it is rk where it times down after a few seconds.
---
If you have a look in collections, you can have a look in the gambit badge on the right, it shows potential weapons and such that can drop.
---
Wait till next week. High impact void pulse with feeding + demolitionist.
---
i've had like 1 or 2 disconnects in the middle of the match was very frustrating, but i was moved to orbiter and got the warning message for leaving game, nothing about rejoining... so u mean i have to log out then log back in to rejoin ?
---
You do get more runes if multiple fireteam members use runefinders.
---
Wanted to add that bows don't have a range stat because arrows don't have falloff damage. Meaning you can shoot from across the map and still deal full damage with each shot.
---
Range on a bow is replaced by accuracy, which gives you a good indication of what the optimal engagement distance for each bow is. Recurves fire quickly and work well in a closer engagement and compounds prefer a little more distance but deal more damage.
---
Only keep stuff that is god rolled (it might be meta in the future) or if its something you use a lot or a thing you really enjoy using. The only exception is high light level gear, keep it for infusion
---
Legacy of Osiris and Warmind are the other two free campaigns - so I would suggest those! That's what I did before buying it all at least.
---
Calibrate weapon just means get kills with that kind of weapon.
---

---
That's not right at all.  I can't believe someone would do that.  Don't fricking take another artist's hard work just to make profit off of something that ISN'T yours.  If you want a good poster drawing then go fricking learn how to draw.

"OOh mE stEaL aRt.  mE mAke MoNEy hEhEhe."

I think you mean aptitude. 
---
Not too hot at English, either... üòè
---
If its the same class you can't get class items more than once
---
Getting Caydes gun is a tough one. i suggest looking a tutorial on the fastest way getting it. And yes, it's an exotic. It's perks are Memento Mori (if you get a kill and then reload, you get 6 extra damage bullets and it glows and it makes really sick sound). And the range on the gun is like a scout rifle.
---
I‚Äôve honestly just started using the Luna, I haven‚Äôt gotten any good roles yet. But I have other hand cannons that are in the same archetype and atm they‚Äôre being beaten out by Scouts even at close range. And I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a bad player, I‚Äôm in Mythic 2 for Comp and that‚Äôs just me playing comp for like a week. Idk  
---
Personally I feel scouts rk are filling every role rather than being for mid-long range engagements.
---
Pretty sure he is correct. You can get the drops but they will be below LL.
---
Thats how it was in Y1 at least, I have not tried since then.
---
Also, if you have a level 950 character (and 950 guns) and are about level 60-70 of the season pass, you should be able to level up even a brand new character from 750 to 950 if it is a LL concern.
---
Good place is the hidden room on the whisper mission. Basically, it's just tons of shadow thralls spawning until you get killed or leave the room. Very effective for any catalyst that requires only normal kills.

He's just...

**Menacingly !**

Prices are around 30 legendary shards for each of the 4 pieces. And 97 legendary shards for the fated engram.
---
I remember doing Crucible and randomly dropped the Monte Carlo auto rifle...chances are out there for sure...
---
You ever played gambit? 
---
Oh i get it you are the shit teammate
---
Thanks for the clarification
---
 Neededddddddd....
---
Rapid hit and kill clip (or opening shot, I find it very hard to get along with Killclip) then anything that maxes out range. Range masterwork, extended barrel, accurized rounds. 
---
It's actually an insanely good HC on console because it's a 180 precision frame.
---
Rare chance when dismantling weapons.
---
If you bann guys like this immediately they know how to make the cheats better and undectable.
---
I've seen a Titan farm like fifteen kills on one of these. Let me see if I can find it
---
Yeah except Guardians actually can fuck their Ghosts
---
Yeah just been reading up on it, apparently Bungie can detect the hook and virtual inputs and are banning people now so that‚Äôs an improvement.
---
Apparently there have been undetectable handles found that can be hooked, but there‚Äôs nothing public right now, hence eulogy there aren‚Äôt entire lobbies full of hackers
---
 Tiss is hereeeeee‚ù§Ô∏èeeeeeeeee.......

I wish i knew what any of this meant. I end up spending most of my time doing random public events so I know I'm probably missing out on a lot.

Mediocre meme, ive seen better

Smoke and Mirrors has special commissioned art for each song and its all beautiful. Coincidentally its also their best album.

Seems to be on the increase now that the game is f2p and the PC port switched to Steam.
---
Do you mean Hunter ?
---
Extra points for back to the Future use.  Well done.
---
Tell him he‚Äôs gonna have to grind, and tell him that he should try and do raids some time, because those are very fun. He can do all the exotic quests on planets that pop up once you‚Äôve finished the story, like rat king and idk any others

You people are the reason we ended up with a no-skill fusion rifle and fusion grenade meta in d1. Grenades are actually very strong right now and I would say pretty well balanced.

Cool thanks. I must have that and not realise.
---
I find the quest log to be atrocious in this game.

Only recently returned to the game and it's like they made it even harder to track what your doing.

Anyway thanks.

They look n handle awefull
---
Risk runner, sleeper simulant, Whisper of the worm, outbreak perfected, Polaris lance are the few I can think of. Also 920 nightfall‚Äôs regularly drop exotic armor pieces.
---
They did just separate from their publisher they had to make money go further this time let's hope that our investment in our game isnt in vain
---
What buffs and debuffs are you stacking?
---
Thank you! I don't have a firing line sniper as of yet so I could grind for that. I just really don't want this week to go to waste since I have a boss checkpoint with all Divinity puzzles done. (I heard it saves progress if all puzzles are done)
---
Maybe, the thing is he isn't in shadowkeep really but I could put his silhouette in the back as to show he's gone sort of thing
---
There are 3 spots for weapons. Your primary which deal kinetic damage, secondary which is an energy weapon and deals which ever elemental effect the weapons has (solar, arc and void) and heavy. Using a sniper for example if it is in the primary slot it‚Äôs a kinetic damage sniper but will still use secondary ammo, the green ammo boxes. Working in reverse an auto rifle with an elemental modifier on it, it will go in your secondary weapon slot but still uses primary ammo.
---
I got a genesis swashbuckler subjunctive and its great. Melee kill something then unlimited ammo on arc shielded enemies. Been useful for the nightfall ordeals.
---
I'm glad to see others think so haha.  I really like armor 2.0, I actually pay attention to my perks and mods now, compared to pre 2.0.
---
That helm tho..
---
You can only rejoin if it sends you back to the title screen
---
i got this like 2 weeks ago maybe even later
---
Ggs. Also your Titan looks sexy as hell.
---
He‚Äôll always live on in the heart of guardians.
---
And one of them isn‚Äôt a bad Titan so doesn‚Äôt use the one eyes ugly
---
First of all, wouldnt you need to know someones mac first otherwise this "attack" would be rather aimless and random.
---
Furthermore, i think (hope) neither blizzard nor bungie/steam would ban someone based on just that one criterium. Especially since changing your mac address isnt exactly a new concept or hard to do for that matter.
---
Aye it happens a lot, i had a match where i had to solo kill envoys and ended up with 55% primevil dmg since i saved ult + power for when i had a few stacks
---
Slot 1 kinetic.
---
That‚Äôs the jo- forget it
---
lose 15 motes they get primeval have a well, chaos reach, shadowshot and hammer of Sol all using mountaintop recluse and well warlock has lunafaction.

Better off just having Ikora take the components and give us a random VO drop...I have so many of those sitting in my Postmaster.

I'm pretty sure if you just go back to the comp playlist and select a game it puts you back in if it's still in progress

Blade Barrage with exotic arm piece Shards of Galanor will refill all the way when you kill two guardians in an invasion.  I have personally done this many times.  I don't want to do doubt you but there are ways of getting them back quickly. There is also this video showing how you can do a crazy BB build and get your super back very quickly.  
---

Huh, I always thought the captain was the large one, welp I have zero reason to hold on to 15 motes now

May I introduce you to the cheapest way of getting a stroke, trying to collect and bank 20 motes?
---
Can someone clarify what the actual fuck Glory is? I've read that it's the points from Survival so I've played that and it's not going up. Medals and such that people seem to have issue with are going up faster than the glory part.
---
Is this on Xbox or PS4? I didn‚Äôt know there was hackers ffs. Not played pvp in ages
---
What scout is that?
---
Since the vex can shift time they should have 2 versions of all the gear one before it was overgrown like new and one after like they are
---
You need to win survival games in order to gain glory
---
Hey, thanks, these are the kind of answers I was looking for!  
---
To clarify I did not mean Mayhem as I actually meant Clash. I'm not too familiarized yet and I confused those two gamemodes. Sorry!
---
PC this is on
---
there is no point in getting these things, especially considering i got all four weapons my first run through the Offensive. Also... Why not let us like, buy the armor from Ikora like a faction reward kinda thing using these useless components.
---
Thank you! So I assume I just return to orbit when I'm done?
---
 just made an example, the same player did it with the middle solar tree and also with the middle void tree. it can not be that he uses super, goes back to the other side, directly through the portal comes with a great full. especially he did not have 1000 kills to get energy and since he was back over there he had no time to collect orbs. and as far as I know so far no armor in 10 seconds a super full :)
---
XD, id sign up for that to wear as a gag shirt
---
Weapon have to come with a mod slot, blues won‚Äôt have one, legendaries will, and some random exotics will allow you to change the perks but you won‚Äôt be able to add a mod. You can purchase different mods from banshee or just play the game and they will drop randomly. 
---
Once you apply a mod to a weapon you can use it over and over again on different weapons. 
---
Same goes for armor
---
You should have seen the things we did in the good 'ol gjhally days.  You could do that shit in crucible and watch it not only super arc, but chase bastards around the map.
---
Oh my god this triggered a deep memory in me. 
---
Okay so back in Destiny 1. During the end of house of wolves and the lead up to the ttk. That week when Xur sold Gjallarhorn. All the time I use to just sit as far back in the hellmouth and just nuke hive with it. Kind of fun time to fill in for raids n nightfalls.
---
Good times.
---
Ohh I forgot PC guys get it now.

Not sure what it‚Äôs like on console, never heard anything though.

That's why I get 5 and bank. Every time I see someone with fucking 10 running around they get their ass killed.

To be honest it took me a little getting used to but once I did at least we stood a chance instead of getting serial crushed.

Ummmm....do they even exist anymore since armor 2.0 came out?

Wasn‚Äôt there a post on here requesting bungie to turn cayde into a sparrow?

I agree! So satisfying to watch.

Yeah they didn't want to make Halo and Activision wasn't going to force them to.

No, I mostly drink acrylic paint.

But the game is.....
---
Does he call everyone sister?
---
Yep, have it myself.
---
Im sure i heard a youtber say he got general mods like traction on the first day of shadowkeep from zavala etc. But at this point im questioning its existence for armor 2.0
---
This is my memorial to Cayde, RIP
---
He will be missed
---
And then she gently whispered
---
*You never quit do you? First you took out Ghaul, then you woke up the Traveller...*

Unless they as much as breathed on you, in which case they get awarded the kill even if it was 99% suicide.

When you get to Heroic 3, you will not go below that rank, regardless of how many points you lose and vice-versa.

Yeah. Thanks, I just read that if I pull it from collections again it should have energy. I'll try that

Can someone plz explain to me what ether is?

Bad juju, Calus mini tool or the epicurean, and fixed odds. Not sure what my friend was running at the time.

Yeah, just launch the raid and you can run around the underbelly
---
‚ÄúYou just never quit, do you?‚Äù
---
You got this
---
Yeah I can see them being available from breaking down old armor and putting them back in to old armor. I don't think they're relevant with 2.0 because of the mobility stat on armor 2.0
---
You know else I can't it seem to do? In Gambit, it says collect 15 motes I rapid SUCCESSION. Every time I try and get to 15 as quick as my little feet could go, I still can't get it. 
---
And you know what's a pain in my butt? High value targets give you 14 MOTES. 1 shy of 15 for the triumph :(
---
Have you tried reloging or swapping characters?
---
In gambit shards gives back BB much faster in the third round. There‚Äôs also new builds to get your super back insanely fast now. No one is gonna ban someone for exploiting a part of the game. Grow up.
---
Yes you can. And you can do it solo.

Recluse. Although tons of people are complaining  about it so i wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it gets nerfed in the next couple of months. Then again, Bungie is pretty slow at nerfing things.

You can replace yours with the ps4 save, tho it will wipe your other save. And dlc content does not transfer. Its crossave not crossplatform

Disagree with the supers and heavy thing, agree with playlist daily rotation

Definitely having a bad time. i've found the current ordeal nightfall to basically be impossible to run smoothly at the 920 level thanks to unstoppable ogres. The mod that's supposed to counter them simply doesn't work. You can gun multiple magazines into them and maybe eventually it'll work - thanks to their insane hitscan dps that means assured deaths with no counter. Fun.

What about Zavala? He is clearly younger in the face when he first rezzes in his trailer and aged at the end of it. Also Osiris and The Speaker I don‚Äôt believe their ghosts resurrected them to an aged point of their lives.

Is there more to do in the game? ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
One big brain move I've seen used is two people sending medium blockers and two others sending 2 small or one small and one big.
---
Mediums are annoying with their blight spam and shields, the smalls make them invincible for a short time until they die which gives enough time for the shields to regen, and the Knight likes to spam it's fire attack a lot.
---
I had this exact thing used on me, and it's annoying as fuck when the rest of your team don't come in to help because they don't want to lose their 15 stack that they can't bank anyways.
---
*God I hate playing with randoms*
---
Spamming Large blockers isn't really that helpful unless your team is sending in 2 or more, imo. They are just bigger targets with a slightly bigger health pool.
---
I'm not sure what initiated the quest. It might require you reaching lvl 900, because that's when powerful drop objectives appear.

You haven't touched your Xbox, you don't play PS4, and your stats are trash on PC. Sweet work bro.

Well, I already got to 905, so I think that's enough. Maybe I'll look for it later.
---
no idea, maybe tuesday with the new dungeon? maybe when ikora has purged the tower of all life? dont think any info on it has been released

So you expect Bungie to make the game recognize New players as opposed to D1 vets and seperate them? Not asking much there SMFH

Yeah and its only Destiny. Trust me its not my net. I dont use Wifi and i have well above 500mbps at all times connected by Ethernet.  Just disappointing cuz I dont play the game just because It takes me forever to load.
---
That‚Äôs a year 1 weapon from the sound of it. You should not be wasting shards on that
---
Most raids are only cleared by 5-10% of the playerbase, but since new light, I'm guessing the numbers will get a lot lower.
---
There's another "quest" somewhere in your list that is actually the interactible one. Terrible, confusing design I know but go through the pages slowly and look for another chalice-shaped thumbnail. If it really isn't in there you may need to complete the bounty that gives you your first rune or get another one from Benedict.
---
That's what I'm saying your looking at wrong thing their is a quest involving the chalice and the chalice itself check the different pages in quest tab
---
The matchmaking has actually gotten a lot better and to be honest I feel as if whatever they are doing for matchmaking currently is working great(my personal experience). I unfortunately have to agree with other people that comp is not for you. It‚Äôs a game mode for experienced crucible/Destiny players. Not saying you can‚Äôt play it but you would probably have a better experience if you had better guns from playing PvE and more experience from regular PvP modes. When I started Destiny I jump right into trials and hated it until I came back with a better load out and more knowledge of movement of my character and environment.
---
Yep. Me and my 2 roommates got it down to a t. Now all we need is for me to hit 950 lol
---
No there were a guardian named shin, Who didn't die
---
mayhem does not count
---
Crazy, because I seem to only get teammates who think the only thing on the map *is* the portal.
---
I signed in automatically ranked up in crucible and the reward was Monte Carlo
---
am hunter can confirm
---
Quality shit post
---
I wish you everything you wish for me. But 50 times worse.
---
I will have to check but i am pretty sure it is open. Thanks for the recommendation.
---
I don't care personally but DFP has been going against the meta for a long time. (also makes for more views on youtube)
---
I didn‚Äôt say it was from xur, I said it was the season pass engram.
---
&gt;  Apparently a lot of people don‚Äôt know? 
---
I've never met a player that hasn't known, in post or ingame.
---
Well here‚Äôs the question, are guardians fertile? We know guardians have relationships and by assumption sex. If they are fertile and a baby is born with out the light, then guardians aren‚Äôt that special without the light. If the baby is born with the light, then there‚Äôs 2 outcomes. Either the baby stays a baby, or most likely the baby grows to a ‚Äúmature‚Äù age and stops. 20-30ish is my guess.
---
Can't really be bothered to be honest was just wondering if I had it right. Thanks for the help though dude, take it easy.
---
Nop 750 is standard level start now
---
Very often I‚Äôve had the primeval spawn and the voice line: 
---
‚ÄúPrimeval compromised, take it out!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúEnvoy down, take out the primeval!‚Äù 
---
Go off immediately or after only one envoy going down. It‚Äôs one of the big reasons I moved to Prime, since it‚Äôs blatantly obvious to the randoms that they need to kill the envoys first.
---
Crap
---
There is no best subclass. Every subclass has its uses and viability when playing PvE or PvP. Currently most will tell you top tree sentinel for PvE and bottom tree striker titans for PvP. However bottom tree striker is receiving a nerf and will not be nearly as powerful as it currently is. Top tree sentinel is great in stationary boss dps fights but top tree sunbreaker also has some good utility. Shoulder charge builds can be super powerful but expect that to change as well with the revert to 1/2 punch shotgun and the shoulder charge mechanic. I often find myself switching subclasses multiple times in a raid, raid banners allow for easy class and weapon switching, for boss fights it‚Äôs probably best to go with top tree sentinel, encounters with high add clear bottom tree striker is good. Short boss damage windows top tree sunbreaker. Don‚Äôt feel like you need to constrict yourself to the single ‚Äúmeta‚Äù build or subclass
---
In my opinion, The Ace of Spades is always worth the grind. Hands down best PvE handcannon. My opinion, of course.
---
Ah another guardian of taste.
---
Polaris Lance
---
Mida multi tool
---
Jade rabbit,but I recommend Polaris Lance the most
---
That's the adhortative ü§î
---
i choose to be uplifting! 
---
its only 500 more points! 
---
YOU CAN DO IT
---
Best pve handcannon imo
---
It certainly looks like the companion app...but looking at mine, Xur is not listed in my vendors tab, only Spider. So, I'm not completely sure.
---
I can tell you for a fact that you can. I do not own forsaken, but I have one of the keys for that box (which I'm unable to purchase)
---
Yup, happened to me few days ago. Teammate and I had 2x15 motes and almost killed 3 large blockers (ofc other 2 have no idea what they are supposed to do) but then invader came and dusted us with rocket launcher... Damn i was so mad
---
I wouldn't mind that!
---
No because I had just woke up, but I did cry In the shower until the water got ice cold. Then I cried some more.
---
I thought it was pretty easy, and I think redrix is in a pretty good place, maybe a slight buff to counter the desperado nerf but it‚Äôs still my go to on long range maps
---
750 is the new baseline, so any new character *is* starting from the beginning.
---
Bruh
---
Same with the Season of the Undying exotic armor pieces to my knowledge. The Fated Engrams that are Season Pass rewards have the same loot pool as the Fated Engram that Xur sells as far as I am aware.
---
I not sure, thats just what byf said
---
Look at Reddit post updated today with the new Zur items. There are people complaining their exotics only have 1 energy and can‚Äôt support higher mods.
---
Plenty of people don‚Äôt know.
---
Soo true!!
---
Wasn‚Äôt impressive the last 900000 this exact screenshot was posted.
---
Rey Mysterio mask
---
I think you have to be fireteam leader for the power handicap/modifiers to work and just an FYI that the five of swords don‚Äôt work on Nightfall: The Ordeal.
---
Destiny is bea
---
I got a purple "electric violet" or something ornament for riskrunner. I think it came from a bright engram back in season 4 (I hadn't played since then).
---
Cayde-sicks
---
Nope, Shin Malphur never died. Dredgen Yor killed his mentor and his parents. The ghost not only pitied shin, but saw potential in the kid. If I remember he may have even had Light
---
What should I do with all the redeemable items (alkana dust, seraphite etc) I have? Just mindlessly hand them in for legendary shard? Or is there something else I should use them for?
---
Maybe Instagram isn‚Äôt 100% bad
---
Yes.  It's excellent in PVE and and quite good in PVP.
---
It‚Äôs just kinda meh, bungo needs to stop adding exotics that have no place, I‚Äôm not saying it happens a lot but why even bother adding it if it‚Äôs just gonna get faulted
---
does it become Ten Thousand Voices then? sounds op bungo pls nerf
---
I used Way of the Current to destroy Way of the Current
---
I only get teammates who afk near the portal then instantly die then go back to afking near the portal for their next grand entrance. I‚Äôve noticed this pretty frequently in other modes too, lots of people will go to the effort of joining games and wait for their team to do the activity, in gambit it seems the least logical.
---
This is what I'm getting on High settings in Task Manager. It wouldn't seem like anything is being used up to the max so I'm quite confused. I'm guessing it probably is to do with my GPU not being up to scratch like a previous commenter said.
---

---
Luck of the draw man.
---
yeah...
---
You can't reset glory rank, so it will automatically update but it might not be instantaneous so once you get there try logging off and back in or go to the tower/orbit.
---
Okay bich stfu you dont know shitü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Nah I meant I doubt people wouldn't figure out after 100's of hours not your playtime 
---
Anyway welcome to the game I hope you have a fun time
---
I meant light sorry not ghosts I‚Äôm stupid
---
You must seriously be exaggerating. I've been playing since launch and I never have terrible spawns. The only time I get horrible spawns is if we're losing so hard that Shaxx is about to call it and even then, when I spawn, I encounter the enemy about 5 seconds after spawning. In the clip he's against an entire clan who probably know what they're doing and they're most likely all positioned around the map, leaving little to no good spawn points.
---
Source?
---
Was it grey when you got it?
---
This is likely just going the contrast and applying aglosen blur
---
Last night I managed to lose 3 motes total and heal the enemy primeval for 118%, with 18 or 19 guardian kills and we still lost. Two of my random did zero prime damage, I felt like this in that moment.
---
Yeah I assume this is like preventing us from getting hungry. We can get hungry but the ghost has the ability to keep us full
---
The menagerie has a lot of great weapons for very little effort and you can get a guaranteed drop of what you want.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt know because I don‚Äôt play Hunter. Or fight hunters that often either. Still cool
---
*Whoosh*
---
Arc Staff is my favorite super for many reasons, and this is one of those reasons.
---
What was it
---
A fellow pve not forgotten user. Never thought I'd see one
---
There‚Äôs a lore book about a risen refusing help from his ghost and the ghost says ‚ÄúI can make you full‚Äù in response to the risen being hungry
---
Okey relax, we Are All freinds here
---
It would be a good start but I suspect he would find some of the better weapons to his liking. Fusion rifles, grenade launchers, trace rifles, and any of the strange exotics.
---
Exotic engram you baboon
---
Yeah you just need forsaken. I think all of the old season pass exotics now require forsaken to get. I know at least the majority of them do. Just recently started grinding for thorn after buying forsaken.
---
If you just play and do bounties with a 10% xp shell on you progress fast
---
I mean, the Eververse store is pretty lame, though.
---
Yah, I‚Äôve been looking for a secondary to have anti barrier rounds. My friend just says get the recluse the problem is one I suck at pvp and two I don‚Äôt want to be a sheep that flocks to an overused weapon.
---
Warframe(by D2players)=pay2win/grind bad
---
destiny2(by WFplayers)=pay2win/grindbad
---
Things heating up in the Shaxx fandom, I see.
---
r e c l u s e  a l l  t h e  w a y
---
As long as it isn‚Äôt Shaxx or Banshee, then I‚Äôm good.
---
i piss in your tea fellow , and yes its a cash grab !!! you think bungie was just being nice? ahh will give 75% of our game away free, were so nice. its all about the cash , the only reason this or any AAA mmo with cash transactions exist. open your eyes fanboi
---
I feel your pain
---
Then the tokens aren't for you.
---
Huh, then we have a lore inconsistency here.  Damn.
---
Subjunctive is pretty good. Any hand-cannon is good. 
---
Honestly, I have Recluse and it's in my vault. I've been getting so many weapons, there's no point to keep upgrading it and wasting upgrade modules. I'll just wait til I hit 950.
---
But, there are other options.
---
I actually really want this
---
What about Shin Malphur? He was became a Guardian while he was still alive
---
It‚Äôd be badass!
---
Yup that‚Äôs basically the jest
---
Says the guy that posted a picture of his dick
---
Gambit is so bad and neglected right now.
---
Someone remind me why we have a collector and sentry again?
---
Omg this is so good
---
magic number is 1 medium and 1 small blockers
---
hahaha just makes you a sucker , so what did you pay -$150 total ??? i paid $10 for season pass , and can play 75% of the game.
---
It probably also has something to do with almost all the reviews being done on pc so if your on console it‚Äôs going to feel drastically different. I tend to just get the weapon myself and decide whether or not I think it‚Äôs worth using
---
100% agree. When someone says ‚ÄúI suck‚Äù or something, and then someone mentions the bot and it goes like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing amazing. Keep it up!‚Äù Please.
---
Lol ok.
---
The game has been out since 2017, had 4 expansions since then, they decide to release a trial version of the game, 75% of it (according to you) at that, and you say it's a cash grab? You're r e t a r d e d.
---
Light manifests at a certain age?
---
i love this community the other r/destiny is too toxic
---
It‚Äôs not confirmed tho
---
Isn‚Äôt it counterintuitive to meme about the over abundance of memes?
---
Damage per shot*
---
They wouldn't do that to Banshee. The dude has been through enough already.
---
Yeah what ever you‚Äôre cool with...I used an arc sniper in the energy slot for the knights with shields. It‚Äôs a pain with any load out you use.
---
Am Hunter can't confirm.  
---
(I'd rather use my storm on adds for the motes and help teammates have an easy pool of them laying around to collect quickly. Staying behind to counter invaders is always nice too)
---
D:
---
True I guess, I just don‚Äôt want to grind for a long time and then get a weapon that in fact isn‚Äôt very good.
---
Calus's treasured is pretty sexy as well.
---
Rad ty
---
Honestly I just want to see the one where he goes on a tangent about head butting kells and tearing out vex hearts with his teeth.
---
Banshee only has the redoable bounties for bd right?
---
‚ÄúThis gun is so broken‚Äù says the professional PVP player with enough skill to stay alive to use it 
---
‚ÄúThis gun is trash‚Äù says the professional Raider when it doesn‚Äôt 1 phase riven 
---
Don‚Äôt trust people online, trust the people who you know enough about them that you trust their opinion, or do what some of my clan members do and just get it anyway
---
Yah I have a subjunctive with swashbuckler and outlaw so it‚Äôs not bad. Maybe the last word will give me better luck in comp.
---
It make you into a banana
---
Actually I have thoroughly enjoyed this game and continue to do so. Worth every penny. Suckers get the f2p version and cry when they don't have access to something.
---
I'm a kinder guardian. Well I hit like 920 light level, but thinking i need to pick up DLC. I'm pretty tight money wise, so which is the best bang for my buck?
---
Lmao you don‚Äôt even know what that means but nice try pal
---
Same. I bow hunt with compound bows irl. Archery has always been something I love and I was hyped when they introduced bows. As you said, the rhythm of it is great. My subtle calamity that I have 31k kills with just has one of those rhythms that honestly reminds me of the bow I shoot irl in terms of drawing. It‚Äôs such a great feel though. Didn‚Äôt take much patience at all, I was hesitant to use them at first in PvP, but then I did and my friends were all amazed with how well I did and it‚Äôs just taken off from there. Now all I run are bows unless something forces me to use a gun. In which case I use my year one allied demand sidearm haha. I‚Äôm freaking Hawkeye over here
---
I somehow got extra valor today like a lot more for winning
---
:D Your bullets were no match for the density of their Jedi auras!
---
Pretty solid work my man. 
---
The wife and I spent about 4 hours doing a spiffy Orxy pumpkin and that PoS rotted in less than 3 days bc we live in SoCal. Hope yours holds up better.
---
I just realized I have no idea what my exo's arms look like. Do they all look like Ada-1 without the armor?
---
Shame it‚Äôs from instagram though
---
I‚Äôve only played 3 matches of comp. two matches in a row it paired me with one other rando against teams of 3. Said screw this. Wasn‚Äôt remotely fair.
---
I know, I just started uni and have no time lol
---
In Levi you get a chest at the end of every encounter, and in eow.there are one or two secret chests and one at the end
---
If i got an engram from xur, then switch characters, can i get another one?
---
Teammates are like scavengers
---
Leeeroooyyy Jenkins!
---
Why?
---
The game will never ever be boring, I probably passed 69420 in D1
---
But wait, you didn't get bifurcated. That's now how this works!
---
The Drifter calls me a snitch every time I start a match... Fuck that cool guy lol
---
Pretty sure I read somewhere that their is a secret number aside from your glory rank that determines who you match against that is based off your performance in crucible over all. Because of this I would recommend playing regular crucible a bit so it can calibrate that number better then hop back into survival. I personally don't think it should be that way and feel like comp should be based only on glory rank alone otherwise whats the point of glory rank? But Bungie just keeps doing Bungie things.
---
Yes. We call that mmr. New players and bad players(being a vet doesn't make you not bad) will have starting mmr. This is not a new concept at all and standard for most. Smh....
---
Nope.
---
Because it‚Äôs bungie
---
It should pop up ‚Äúmarked for vengeance‚Äù on the last panel
---
Closest I think of are the camo shaders from EDZ.
---
That thing is my go to sniper now, if I ever change my triple bow Loadout.
---
One per account I believe
---
Saw it coming, still loved every second building up to it.
---
Dog is confused
---
Survival of the fittest is a saying. This game mode is called Survival... Hmmmm with this being said. If you want to be the best you have to beat the best. You're not going to get better playing potatoes.
---
"STANDO POWAAAAHHHH!!!"
---
Nice
---
Never go for 15 until your portal is opened and you have an invader stopping them from getting portals. Easiest way to win is to never let them deposit
---
That is correct.  The Ghost was named Tianshi, and his story can be found in the Ghost Stories lore book.
---
I never collect except the scraps. Unless I can coordinate with voice, I don't expect my teammates to think strategy. So I just kill from a distance.
---
Oh cool, thanks for the confirmation
---
Nah he knows his marked that's his only option
---
SAME. Agreed
---
Lol!
---
I try to teach people they say to chill it‚Äôs just gambit so that doesn‚Äôt work. And this is across several games
---
f
---
I have the other three keys and the black armory lady doesn't offer the mold so I think it's still bugged.
---
Template?
---
This is me
---
Literally every game of gambit.
---
Lol! No shit! Really?!? What did it decrypt into?ü§£üòÇ
---
Haha true, Luna nerf changed everything, I sure miss mountaintop/well in gambit with an occasional 60% boss damage
---
I just wanna know where they came from
---
I love this song, it plays when you unlock your new super and it sounds amazing killing everything in there while this song plays.
---
Gambit is the game mode where players don't need Rat King to activate Rat Pack perk.
---
This season's Ritual weapons aren't pinnacle drops.
---
All three dropped at 950 for me (while I was above 960).
---
I mean he is pretty important, he has a contained chunk of ascendant plane and is one of the oldest living guardians
---
Nah but as a single-player game it still has finite playability
---
Death stranding is gonna suck. Kojima has peaked. 
---
You won't be missed. Delete your guardians and all you're gear if you're so sure you aren't coming back mate. Otherwise quiet. Lol
---
