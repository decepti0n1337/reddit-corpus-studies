We need a DLC that replaces the soundtrack with Ska music.

---
I wish that was useful 
---
Hunters be like: ‚Äúclosed eyes and smashes bumper killing the entire enemy team‚Äù
---
Is he talking about affinity farming with a frost shield spam? It‚Äôs the only thing I could think of
---
Don't worry bro I'm omw, my Hammerhead has mulligan so I get missed shots back 
---
It's not forced really. Most of the guns you get through PvP are best used in PvP. So if you play PvP a lot you end up with good PvP weapons. Same thing goes for PvE stuff (breakneck, loaded question).
---

---
It seems weird to me that people who hate Crucible will do it for a gun that'll most likely sit in their vault because it's not useful for the content they like. I mean, to each his own. It's fine if anyone doesn't like PvP but you can't complain about hating content that you don't have to play. 
---
U kidding me this thing recks 
---
Yes it works here as well. I think that's how you get to one of the Easter eggs.
---
I wish they would open up the "haunted forest" event on weekends for the chance to get like D1 trials gear from it. It would give mercury something to do at least some of the time.
---
No no, pretty sure it's a JoJo reference.
---
Oh haha I should've realized that, my bad
---
Check in inventory 
---
This is the one damn thing I want in D2, I had so much fun and almost always cam in top 3. I remember one of my races I finished so far ahead in 1st place that the race ended before anyone else could finish
---
I dnt get it
---
found it, i'm new to this game haha
---
thank you
---
What?
---
Might be the modifier for today. Blackout I think it's called. 
---
Now do a 900
---
Maybe learn how to use it first? I've been gunning people down like crazy in Crucible.
---
looks to be the memory of cayde cloak but with the "no cape visual glitch"... it happens to my hunter half the time.
---
No problem mate! Enjoy the game!
---
I will say that killing those wielding it with an Auto Rifle is satisfying.
---
No doubt there. Remember when you could play a game at the chance to get ....... get ready for this one...... Any and everything in the game? If you put in the time or we're good enough, you could possibly receive any or all rewards. Not everything is achievable, it's not supposed to be and that's why it takes time or has a learning curve. Wanna know why some of these achievements or trophies are insane or hard as F? Cause it takes time and practice and dedication. Might not be worth the trouble but if you want 100% or a Platinum you'll do it. Why can't that be the case with unlockables or cosmetics or better weapons/armor? If I do the hard mode of a Raid, shouldn't it look cooler, have better perks and be unique to those who put in the work? Or should Eververse just sell em on a rotating weekly schedule? Lolol, drives me nuts sometimes.
---
Dang..
---
Personally, I haven‚Äôt completed Petra‚Äôs run, but I think the hardest part for me is relying on teammates. Idk, I‚Äôve got the entire raid down, I just need people to know wut they are doing
---
Similarly to thousands of other players, I have all of them. So, guess I had to create 20+ posts about each of them?   
---
Imagine each player making the post here about each exotic.  
---
Oh, what a fun place this subreddit would be!
---
That might work for bo3 zombies
---
It's just the worst. I get screwed by those rocks everytime. 
---
To the left it's the chaperone ti the right its sleeper
---
it can if you're chaining lighting rod. you have to really try for precision shots but the amount of crowd control it can do is crazy. dps is shit on it though
---
EA = BAD

therefore EA = Phones

Check out r/fireteams for lfg ü§ô

Curse of Osiris and Warmind DLC were individual DLC, with Forsaken the Destiny team said they wanted to no longer introduce DLC but create updates with the passes instead
---
Dayum! That's pretty awesome. To date, I've forged 84 weapons and have had feeding frenzy on ONE weapon. Second perk was slideshot (blast furnace) so we all know that one was sharded. 
---
Pfft... Looks like Twilight Garrison made a comeback!
---
That would be the bungie thing to do
---
So blurry. What the hell am I looking at? 
---
Sorry wasn't so good of pucture
---
Infamy! 
---
DMC 5 too.
---
Lunafaction boots mate
---
Back in my day it was that event I missed when I came back for the April Update
---
And the helmet stayed on
---
A suprise to be sure but a welcome one.
---
You know the A-word update is a taboo topic, why mention it...
---
I shall! Thanks for the tip mate

No mountaintop? Your already at 2100
---
i literally thought this was r/Minecraft
---
That's much more manageable. I wondered for a while because it *felt* like I wasn't as visible considering I didn't immediately get shot at but I wasn't 100% certain.
---
Honestly I think I'll work on that, just to have it 
---
This is exactly why I don't play gambit. I really want breakneck, bygones, and trust but I just can't do it. Gambit just isn't fun for me. It's the most stressful game mode I've ever played.
---
That's friggin adorable
---
I would love to see that shot from the other guys perspective!

Phoenix Strife Type 0. Y1 crucible chest with an ornament on it.
---
This was the worst matchmaking I've ever had [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3Ye07WwCYg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3Ye07WwCYg)
---
Is that the Black Armory Sniper? Got one with Rampage/Outlaw but not sure if it is that good of a weapon.
---
Great choice!
---
F
---
My friend and I both got it by resetting our Crucible rank.
---
[removed]
---
I completed that step in 2-3 matches, seriously you only need above a .5 KD. 
---
I honestly hated the part that required me to do 3 heroic rituals, took to long compared to other steps.
---
Please don't use your collection of guns...
---
Dawnblade on pc is arguably the best warlock super now since you can flick around and kill everyone but on console it‚Äôs pretty average
---
What do you mean?
---
A blurry picture of a tv?
---
Seems like you‚Äôre lagging really bad lol
---
Any sniper that you like using! I prefer snapshot and whatever on an agressive frame, so Tatara Gaze for energy and Bite Of the Fox for kinetic if I use an energy handcannon.
---
Any sniper oneshots if you headshot so imo it's really down to which scope and zoom you enjoy using.
---
But to answer your question, yeah outlaw is nice. On a rapid frame sniper like Twilight Oath box breathing works really well, since you can finish someone off with a handcannon bullet or two even if you miss the head with the sniper. (:
---
Tether is fun until it happens to you.
---
If you've gotten 1 from blind well, then you're 2 options are doing petras bounty this week for the blind well to get the offering for the engine. After you have the offering go to the engine and give the offering, this should open up the queens court. Usually the chest appears next to the throne in there. Open the chest and you'll have the 3rd seed. Second option: the first encounter in the Last Wish Raid drops it.
---
Old Fashioned?
---
It is? I thought it was great
---
I should add the queens court only works on weeks like this one where the curse is strongest.
---
Now this is pod raceing.
---
Where is this?
---
Anthem isn't even out yet
---
üëÄ ohhhh that‚Äôs hot... that‚Äôs real hot
---
It is shit. 
---
Who was the genius to add that into the game and only allow a select number of players to use it for something useful? Bungie blows ass. 
---
This isn‚Äôt worthy of a clip here... This deserves a medal! üò≥
---
To most this beast is a junker, but to some, this junker, is a beast.
---
Damn his other work is really good too.
---
This was recently posted by the creator of it. 
---
I‚Äôve seen quite a few videos and I still don‚Äôt know what the core story/ challenges/ drive is beyond jet packs and a simple loot grind.
---
Blind well, then the raid
---
Go for a title.
---
I'd call you out for the monster you are, but that chestpiece is too styling. 
---
That‚Äôs tough
---
 
---
Destiny invented tanks, warlocks and hunters?
---
Omg bro... just breathe please... you can cool the whiteknighting for ea... they aint looking.. if you enjoy the game grats play it when it comes out.. as for me i will not be buying it... damn your life ia gonna be rough if you think this was upsetting
---
It will be even better if you go in the crucible and wreck with it.
---
No where did i say they invented did i... nope 
---
I hate ea mostly, but this looks promising. Lets not forget Destiny‚Äôs release. 
---
No, which is fucking sad. I have an ada bounty and the all the steps done on two characters but the one who got the mold hadnt even gotten the box yet and only has two keys. I now have to pray for an ada bounty to drop just to complete the quest when I have two already sitting and waiting. It‚Äôs fucking sad. Last time shattered throne was up i didn‚Äôt have the bounties, now I have two. Went to ada on Tuesday and found out about the glitch. It‚Äôs also one of the things I need for blacksmith. I‚Äôm all around really pissed. 
---
Most of the mask users are not that skilled, you just have to kill them since you shot first probably anyways.
---
I do think the wallhack time should be reduced a bit though.
---
Thank you for making my night. ü§£ü§£
---
Nobody play Comp man.  From one PvE player to another I'm telling you the truth.
---
I haven't touched the ones that were actually buffed.
---
No way in hell that didnt hurt.
---
Man...look i love some ea games... i will even say i love the division by ubisoft.. with all its flaes it had and the troubles it had.  I just dont like anthem :/.. maybe in time i will. I honestly hated destiny at first...but put about 20 hours into it before i warmed up
---
Nice work, really clutched it if you got the bomb afterwords. I see a lot of people not reviving when they easily can in PvP as well, it's a pain, so thanks. 
---
How long was a ‚Äúlong time ago‚Äù?
---
confirm 3rd seed from the blind well offering this week. I just finally got it myself 
---
Seriously, its kinda unfair.
---
Im switching to Warlock, already leveling one.
---
Is the weapon any good for most content? I'm thinking about taking a break from competitive grinding for some pulse rifle stuff and mayhem.
---
It's not that difficult to be both good at PvE and PvP.. 
---
Calling people tryhards because they have something before you, isn't the right way to think about it. Stressing yourself out.
---
 Think of it as some motivation to do better to reach the goal you're wanting. In this case it's getting the last word.
---
The second step took me 2 games, sorry I got it before you bud. But, not sorry
---
In case you want to use a keyboard and mouse instead.
---
WHY ARE YOU WRITING THIS? YOU SHOULD BE THROWING MORE GRENADES! YOU SHOULD BE THROWING GRENADES AS YOU READ THIS!

Nova warp is useless now. But that's not nerfing into the ground I don't know what is

Looks funny with that shader
---
Ew, Facebook.
---
I read all caps in Torgue's voice. THAT SENTENCE HAD TOO MANY SYLLABLES! APOLOGIZE!
---
I am a few decades younger than your dad. But the what my son feels when he watches me play is pure agony.  Several, "*Do you know what a super is?*" muttered through gritted teeth.
---
Wheres the debate here? Destiny all the way lol
---
I‚Äôm thinking this is a pve complaint not pvp
---
Play mayhem and spam supers while hiding. It worked for me.
---
Is that guy wearing a fanny pack?
---
The 90s called...
---
It‚Äôs not about it bring a thing but it being a reoccurring theme.
---
Borderlands?
---
dude chill, some people don't like that.
---
So you can listen to some banging tunes while shooting stuff
---
Well I did do like 15ish before I knew what it was for before forsaken dropped lol 
---
After the recent change to bow draw speed it‚Äôs trash sadly
---
AND THATS EXACTLY WHY I LOVE HIM
---
How dare people feel excited after being screwed by ring so long
---
Hah i really did this ornament. I brings out the prototype vibe of the weapon, highlighting the fact Ana made it with whatever scrap electronics she could find.
---
Last wish is 550 lowest the last word is 500 lowest 
---
Just farm forges for a god roll Blast Furnace.
---
More chill use of your time and better weapon imho.
---
Good ol times
---
Orange Justice was made for the Fortnite dance competition.
---
See this is why some salty tenno and freelancers hate us. But are we gonna care? Nah. Also updoot.
---
***This video is so true . xD***
---
I wish my fiance would do the same... Adorable+
---
Fort is for health and synth for damage. It's just whatever you prefer
---
The bigger the baddies the better Synthoceps is. If there are more enemies but all are just red bar weaklings, Skullfort is better. Synthoceps gives a buff to melee damage and super damage when surround by enemies, as well as a buff to melee range. Pair that up with code of the juggernaut, you can literally punch through an entire army. One punch to activate Knockout (when you critically injure an enemy, you get knockout perk which has now increased melee damage on next melee) and your next punch can basically ONE PUNCH MAN most adds. Even redbar knights/centurions/wizard/Minotaur with an non-matching elemental shield.
---
Where as Skullfort you constantly get your melee ability back, IFFFFFF your melee ability gets a kill. So if you are punching at big baddies you may have a useless helmet for quite some time until your ability comes back. (I remember in the first couple of months of launch, it was bugged and you would get your melee ability back from a Knockout perk kill...not the case anymore)
---
The fact that it crashed every time I tried to play it (tried a solid 6 attempts), I'd say I'm definitely not getting it at launch. 
---
What region are you on?? I'm on EU, and always like knowing there's somebody out there wanting to do stuff like the shattered throne for the wishender or the nightfall for the reward [still haven't gotten a single one :(...] So by all means I'll add you if we're on the same region :)!
---
r/fireteams
---
I mainly play on NA... 
---
Scrubs need it to be able to get 1 kill
---
Yeah meant the last wish lmao. Sorry and thanks.
---
Mind blown.
---
If you are using the Sub Class STRICTLY for super DPS, then Geomag Stabilizers. Alternatively if you are looking for something that is just fun for free roam, Claws of Ahamkara is what I use when just messing about. You get 2 of the range melee abilities.
---
My child, you have yet to see what hard is like 
---
Looks a little üòéGuilty....
---
I‚Äôll see myself out
---
Orange justice still comes from the roy purdy dance though. 
---
That's enough for you? Amateur...
---
Hey! Add me! Im om EU and i want to do Shattered throme and all the stuff! Jugger24#2678
---
I WANT THIS EMOTE
---
They extend super duration significantly if you stay on one target.   Excellent for boss melting. Also sprinting at about 75% super charge, rapid fills your super, with the message "Topping off chaos reach."  
---
They have the traction perk so are good for going fast, turning and changing direction rapidly.
---
My favourite as well :) basically calus' selected, but a bit more authentic looking
---
Then I don‚Äôt have it
---
Dude YES I live for that shader
---
Nice, jesus you messed them up.
---
My last team wiped our petra's run at morgeth because they could not put flag in the beginning using whisper strat that needs three bullets.... 
---
Nessus loot pool. Sometimes Failsafe sells it directly, otherwise opening chests/ranking up rep has a chance to drop it.
---
Ah okay. Thank you for pointing it out. I just started playing a few months ago. Just been solo. The base game was free on PS for a bit. The story i found a bit cheesey at first. Gameplay is a blast though.
---
Foresaken was a fantastic purchase. Storyline i found amazing. Gambit is an absolute blast. An awesome idea for a game mode 
---
This is what the subreddit has become? Poor quality screenshots of weapons not even from the game?
---
Only way that would work is if it was a Microsoft exclusive item.  Pretty sure Microsoft wouldn't want something Halo related on the PS4.  At least not such a direct connection anyway.  
---
If you're on pc I'll do it with you
---
Only one per season, you say?
---
Here‚Äôs a tip. Play mayhem to get the 25 medals as well. Hang back let your noob teammates run in and die then pop your super and kill whoever‚Äôs left. Can probably get it done in around 5 to 7 games
---
How did that lawsuit turn out anyway?
---
A few more weeks till the season of the drifter :)
---
Yeah looking forward to that
---
Took me like 5 matches in Rumble. You should try that if you keep getting put up against stacks or something.
---
You mean harbour, right?

i got last word in a day :p

Hot damn this is probably the coolest Destiny tattoo iv ever seen.

THIS IS INCREDIBLE!!

Your kill = 2%

Assisted kill = 1%

Death = -1%

Don't go to this forge. Just do the 4th one instead. Boss is easily killed with Whisper.
---
Make it an Xbox exclusive. We missed the Hawkmoon fun, they can miss out on guilty spark 
---
*"humming intensifies"*
---
Honestly don't use a shotgun if your shit with it. I personally breezed through the PvP requirements with Ace and a Sniper.
---
holy shit! you‚Äôre insane dude
---
You had a tattoo artist recreate someone‚Äôs original art but you don‚Äôt even know who the original artist is?
---
PS4 takes the longest.
---
Only if they call the shell Church or Alpha. 
---
SMG: 1rst run
---
Sniper: 7th run
---
Shotgun: 167th run 
---
You mean you had a favorite sniper rifle when you played crucible and this was your first exotic shotgun
---
Blue Team always get the good stuff
---
You basically just did compare to it with this "meme" without even trying out the demo.
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 13.
---
/r/Fireteams 
---
They have a hard time doing good with the assets they have. Don‚Äôt make them have to get a license for a single halo reference. 
---
Play mayhem, like a few people have said. If you're playing Titan, use the sentinel shield throw. Hunter, use golden gun. Warlock, use top void bomb. Just stay out of the way and pick your fights. It was a rough start for me but I did it with Nova bomb.
---
You only need Forsaken, Curse of Osiris and Warmind comes with it.
---
Sorry for being a little \* you don't say \* but isn't this guy from Halo?

Or what I‚Äôve dubbed ‚ÄúThe Season of Sorrow‚Äù. 
---
/u/dmg04 /u/cozmo23
---
Thoughts?
---
Nah, anthem looks like a worse version of destiny launch. With EA backing it, it‚Äôs sure to be a shit show. and the lack of creative single archetype exotics sure aren‚Äôt making me excited about getting the season pass. 
---
So I actually need to pay them 40$ or whatever to use the gear that I've earned thru playing their game for tens of hours?! That's fucking next level. 
---
The ones with the money get the final say.
---
I WASN'T BUT I CERTAINLY AM NOW!
---
What can I say, it's DLC content, y9u shouldnt even get it if you dont have dlcs.
---
Are you sure you dont have the expansions?
---
Had the same thing happen in a comp match. All 5 rounds of a countdown match, dude would hide and dance while the three of us would go for the the objective. We won the first three and then lost every single round until the other team lost.
---
I have sent you a friend request. 
---
Did you pick up Crimson from Xur last week? If you aim for the top of the chest, it will usually end in a headshot.
---
Genuine question, why is it better than exotics?
---
community love for character: 0
---
Can you pull it out of collections at your level? Not random rolled stuff of course though
---
will it be a last word?
---
yes
---
That is impressive. Some matches with 3 other decent players, even collecting 52 is half-decent. Losing that many is...special.
---
&gt;It's scales exponentially, but in Reverse.
---
Exponantial scaling can go both directions. It isn't limited to growing (giving you more in return the more you do something), a value can also exponentially shrink (giving you less, the more you do something) often called "diminishing returns" when it comes to games.
---
Recovery also doesn't scale exponentially to begin with; [Example per stat](https://gfycat.com/necessarygleefulbadger). It's pretty much a fixed amount of time each level reduces.
---
OEM user? Enjoy anthem :) 
---
Do you not like raiding or have you had a hard time getting a group?
---
Hard time getting a group :(
---
Hello everyone, I‚Äôm lookin‚Äô for an active a clan that does raids, not askin‚Äô for much here. I spend more time playin‚Äô this game than I‚Äôm willing to admit and I‚Äôm active in raids, gambit, and vanguard strikes and nightfalls. 
---
I‚Äôm lookin‚Äô for clan mates that talk and communicate, it‚Äôs gettin‚Äô boring playing with randoms after a while and I just want people to play with regularly, that‚Äôs all. 
---
I think my exotic pool and builds are solid, just missin‚Äô the Lunafaction boots for my Warlock, hit me up if interested.
---
Ahh interesting, I always assumed it was in accordance to the other singes. Thanks for the info! 
---
TrueVanguard. I‚Äôve found him to be the most legit Destiny youtuber 
---
Tiny servitor
---
When I played Destiny 1 solo I would always use destinylfg.com or .net. it was a little work on my end but I had some good experiences. I hear great things about people finding groups within the destiny companion app. Also you could always ask around in maybe a Facebook group for destiny. Xbox one also has a built in LFG (IDK what you play on), but it was very easy to find a group with that tool. Good luck. You owe it to yourself to experience the raiding aspect of destiny. It's a very different vibe. 
---
also try not being such an ass in 90% of the comments you make.  Looking through your comments is hilarious ...... always talking crap to people and making it seem like you are awesome at the game.  New Flash: Your KD in Crucible is .94 in QP and a .96 in comp, please stop telling others to "Git  Gud" because you need to give that advice to yourself bud ..... I bid you Adue LMAO
---
Im at 6/10 seals and tbh only want it to run trip shogi without tractor cannon(notbthat i hate tc)
---
Tbh it‚Äôs not even like it‚Äôs a skillful shot. He just pointed and hoped it hit. Which he wa a lucky enough it did 
---
Amazing man. I want the hunter one that guy did, on me
---
I never raid cuz i don't like it
---
It would look badass man! Go for it. 
---
Erintel fr4 is better and a lot easier to use. Suros fusions are cheeks compared to others unfortunately 
---
full choke, accurized rounds, rang masterwork, full auto and opening shot
---
No, it‚Äôs available all through the year.
---
What do you mean? :P
---
No problem
---
What a nice lander
---
Lmao exactly this, I tried to get my friends and clan to get the catalyst (and the gun itself for a few) well before the update knowing full well they were buffing it yet none believed it would be any good. Now I get invites every night asking to help run Levi... lol.
---
Add me: RFHRDB#1925... also if you need a clan, just message me in bnet, and I can invite you. 
---
For endgame loot farm such as raid chests you should have more than one character so that you can open the chest multiple time a week
---
They are everywhere
---
i feel like heart phase would be the nail in the coffin for them. ive been 650 for a while but ive avoided raids because of how mechanically scary they are. ive gotten basically carried in LW by people who knew what they were doing and i was still anxious the whole time. 
---
Ya I'm digging it too, games a blast.
---
Pretty much they where arguing from what i remember and so callum snapped and killed his ghost. 
---
The Lardcliff Woil?
---
Can you transfer items across characters?
---
aight, thanks m8
---
No one knows. Nightfalls seem to be on a random rotation, not any set order. 
---
The Wing armor is not DLC gear. The weapons are not DLC gear either. 
---
Of course.
---
When you hover over the machine gun frame, what does it say? Does it say to return to Ada-1, or does it say to complete the Volundr forge? 
---
Its not like its unusable.  
---
Remember getting exotics for public events? 
---
Playing the game for hundreds of hours does not validate an opinion. 
---
This is a very common issue. Bungie is aware of it, so hopefully it is fixed soon. 
---
If you abandon the bow frame, you can complete other frames like normal. You can make a bow the next time Ada-1 is selling bow frames, probably next week. 
---
Yes...eyes up. Eyes up...here. Eyes up here, guardian.
---
I am having this issue as well.
---
They said they are looking for fix but have yet to find
---
Damn, okay thanks, hopefully it‚Äôs next week
---
Lol then I wouldn't know I usually just play crucible or the dlc
---
BOY HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND CAUSE I'LL HELP YOU FIND IT
---
I'd kill ^^ingame to be able to change armor looks to another...
---
What I‚Äôm saying is quit your bitching. 
---
Hey that's my phone background. Nice!
---
It‚Äôs fun for messing around in QP but the ads recoil is nutty and 30fps plus laggy players on console make it sort of a chore to use against other top tier weapons.
---
Until you hit power level 500, you will be swapping out gear so frequently it isn't worth turning in tokens/materials/gunsmith parts for items. If you have a hard time getting enough legendary shards, you should save planet materials for Spider, an NPC you meet in Forsaken who sells legendary shards for a random other planet's resource. He never takes tokens, so it is ok to turn those in to Shaxx and Zavala. 
---
Some things I think every player should know:

* You can level up really fast by doing [Heroic public events](https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/2017/9/7/16263480/heroic-public-events-find-trigger-earth-titan-nessus-io) if you complete a secret objective during public events. Leveling up unlocks the other two elemental subclasses. You will eventually get enough upgrade points to unlock everything, and you can swap between each subclass and subclass tree at will. 
---
* When you look at the director and hold E, it should tell you what you are supposed to do next to advance the story. 
---
* When you encounter enemies with shields, use your secondary weapon to break the shield, and if it is the same element as the shield colour, it will do bonus damage and cause an explosion when the shield breaks. 
---
* The maximum level in the base game is 20 and the maximum light level is 300, but after 260-ish you will need to do weekly and daily challenges (basically, any activity that says "powerful gear") in order to reach 300. With all three DLCs the max level is 50 and the max light level is 650, and you need to do challenges to get above 500. This is "the grind." 
---
* This game is around 80% pve content and 20% pvp content. 
---
* Most guides for base game content have not been updated ever, so the terminology and some information about how to progress are outdated. However, guides for DLC content are mostly new enough that this is not a problem.
---
* The in-game chat is always very quiet, but do not confuse this for the game being dead. Most people communicate using Discord and other programs like that. To find people to play with, you can use this subreddit's discord (linked in the top right on desktop) or the /r/destinythegame discord (linked in their sidebar). There is also the official Destiny 2 app, /r/fireteams, /r/destinysherpa for raids (do not worry about this until later), or platform-specific things. 
---
what do you guys think how could i improve
---
Warlock, because I liked the ‚Äòmagic‚Äô feel
---
Its marketing. The fanbase has been saying sence the first peek at the game that its a destiny inspired game. Read articles on the game, the authors make the comparason for us. Read tye memes here. The memes make the comparason. Call the game whatever you want. Everybody. All of us. Compare it to destiny.
---
Ea loves that.  They love that we are marketing this game for them, do the destiny fans. They are without a doubt going to use that comparason anytime they can. Because its a fanbase they dont own all of.
---
And its EA, why would you even give them the benefit of the doubt??? Why even touch a game that putrid group of sociopaths support?
---
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who thought the UI was complete garbage. The menus were so frustrating!
---
I was also not at all a fan of having to crawl around the town in between every mission. While you‚Äôre sloooooowly making your way around the town you look down at your own body to see you are jogging? Meanwhile npc‚Äôs are keeping pace at a leisurely walk?
---
Damn. They were just that bad. I feel for you and that dude. 
---
No need to be rude. 
---
lmaooooo.
---
*Chuckle* Oh, look what you have.
---
Season of the drifter? It‚Äôs the 6th season in Destiny 2. It‚Äôs going to focus mainly the Drifter and Gambit. I believe a new game mode for gambit, and I believe we‚Äôll have a quest for thorn :)
---
Shoot and get currency to eventually make stuff?  Not the same at all. 
---
Maybe they'll break away from EA like Bungie did with Activision, that would be glorious. 
---
I agree either one hit should be nerfed or every class should have one hit abilities. Even warlocks don't have a true one hit ability. They have the charged grenade, but that requires you to use a super that was nerfed into the ground.
---
Yep, I‚Äôve been a hunter main since D1 and played the hell out of Forsaken and never got Shards of Galanor and now that they‚Äôre nerfed along with Blade Barrage I have no motivation to play the game anymore, maybe when thorn comes back tho
---
Yes, I believe when Season of the Drifter drops in early March. 
---
It really is I played my Hunter yesterday and I kept forgetting to reload lol
---
Emotes comes from etched engrams, you'll get packages from tess everis after vailla storyline, osiris, warmind and forsaken, also after every lvl up after lvl 50.
---
Yeah Prometheus is a fun weapon I wish it could hold more ammo though
---
Why is this map not on Xbox? I've seen so much of it on pc clips.
---
Hitting fabled is easy on solo. If u need friends for it, i can help. just message me :)
---
Behind threat level w/ surrounded, yeah. 
---
For real, what map is this?!
---
Downvoted &gt;:(
---
I absolutely hated all the gear from Crota lol. Loved the kabr set tho. Bottle cap remover ftw
---
Do not rush to judgement based solely on a screenshot of a match result tho, 
---
I once had a match that ended literally 30 seconds after I joined the game - it showed that I did nothing but that doesn't mean that I was afk or anything.
---
My first five times were without a mic... It's possible but boy is it stressful 
---
Same.  Hoping for Tuesday.
---
That was clutch as hell man you're doing great
---
Frfr
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **4th Cakeday** RobotFoxTrot! ^(hug)
---
Its implied that a fight did occur, even though he was already very hurt.  That's why his ghost was out in the first place.
---
Sorry, completely new to reddit.
---
Seems like he was doing something, got caught out my invaders a lot apparently. I‚Äôm gonna guess most of the other teams kills were on him, he‚Äôs just gotta hide better or bank early
---
Right???
---
Has that been proven do you have any source to back that up that Ace wasn't real?  I'm am familiar with that theory but that is all it is.
---
Dear God I only needed a single Heroic Cryopod completion for some quest and it took me like 8 events before I was able to push one Heroic. And then only because *no one else showed up*. 
---
That was one of my most frustrating experiences in D2 so far.
---
Huh..? They buffed Nova Bomb a pretty good amount? Hunters got nerfed on void &amp; got very minor buffs for the other two? 
---
It's a 3-4 tap my guy
---
Thanks

What? Guys can't have nice butts now? Why? 
---
One of the best crucible maps imo (for shotgunners lol)
---
I'm 612 and still haven't beaten the forge yet. Even with 650 randoms
---
Somebidy needs to do a skyrim edit
---
YES YOU DID
---
Yeah 
---
Someone could crosspost this to r/leagueoflegends and it works the same. Hahaha

*glove slap duelling emote*
---
Thank you!
---
I bet the neighbors love him
---
Def got bugs and frame rate drops 
---
I feel ya on the Gambit burnout. The Breakneck grind was awful; however, completely worth it all. Thankfully Bungie is adding a new Gambit mode next season. Hopefully it isn‚Äôt as long of a mode. That or removing any quest steps requiring large quantities of Games Played. The AFK‚Äôers added unnecessary torture.
---
You get to deflect shit by pressing C
---
Ah, thought there was a special melee I wasn't aware of.
---
68 damage a headshot would be a 3 tap my guy. I was saying the damage has not changed. 
---
It is true just tested it thanks.
---
Hey thanks for posting I did not know uldren was out!
---
I didn‚Äôt find it to be too bad. There‚Äôs some safe spots you can use but you have to constantly be on the move when you‚Äôre at them. Subtle Calamity with major spec does a lot of damage to the wizards and can one shot all other adds from long distance so it makes it easier. 
---
I've completed Volundr once but it says 6 ignitions. This just means youve gotten to the boss at the end twice. To complete the frame you gotta beat the two previous waves and the boss.
---
Looks like I'll be doing that then
---
üëç
---
Just happened to me rn kinda salty
---
No problem my guy. Enjoy the Last Word!
---
Lucky! I wish I had Anti Paladin!
---
THIS IS AMAAAZING!!!!!!!!
---
Ahahaha what I said when I saw it ü§£
---
Hunters really have less health than Warlocks? My warlock is walking glass compared to my hunter and their resistance is both at 5 
---
OOTL what are blueberries? 
---
I'm doing a single augmented weapon bounty right now
---
If I get lucky and it's a Bygones, I'll take it, but otherwise I'm gunna start MWing this vendor roll
---
I was talking about destiny. Gonna still act like classic internet scum and not know anything about the conversation, or reading for that matter. 
---
Holy shit that's a superb tat!
---
‚ÄúNo Lag‚Äù
---
(Immediately gets killed by a Stormcaller using Storm trance from their own spawn)
---
I will once I can stop failing miserably at guild aiming.
---
Noooooo why psn :( 
---
It‚Äôs not the end of the world to be honest. First real bug I‚Äôve encountered on D2 aside from the odd disconnect and floaty corpse.
---
but warlocks wear dresses...
---
Osiris was a loot box exclusive. 
---
That‚Äôs awesome! 
---
You'll get it eventually, it is a bit difficult. (I took about 15 tries but got an exotic drop from a cursed thrall. They gave me the queenbreaker.)
---
Aw. Got Volundr Warden to a sliver of health. Gah!!
---
Good luck on the roll!
---
I laughed so hard when I just saw this. 
---
Cammy cakes to be impressed, the dream team /mr fruit for giggles and fun
---
Yeah but that Copenhagen mint tho, is that Pouches Long Cut or Fine Cut
---
More like Dumb facts around random drawing...
---
It's Catapult boost, and yeah I have Lion's Rampant equipped as well
---
Top tree gg buff is definitely not minor. 
---
Yeah but not for me cause of school and I just wanted to use the new Warlock supers with Forsaken
---
Lol ever heard of copyrights?
---
lol that would be hillarious imagine Cayde 6 asked Uldren "uh...this is awkward...do you want me to lend you a bullet there buddy?" xD
---
When the bombs dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, people were vaporized and their outlines were burned into walls behind/around them
---
Yeah I am glad I did the base campaigns on my Warlock because I got the Sunbracers and I love them I was just complaining because the old campaigns are so boring to play for the 4th or 5th time
---
Blueberries refer to other guardians not in your fireteam, specifically their blue level icon vs the green one members of your fireteam have.
---
You forgot 10 mobility and spectral blades + a Luna‚Äôs howl
---
lining up a sniper headshot to try take down a a super alone is one of the most fun things you can do in pvp
---
Lol is it rare ? I didnt know forges dropped sparrows
---
Sorry, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but...there aren‚Äôt any communities made up of people who still run pre-forsaken content 
---
Lol yeah its pretty rare
---
Obscure what facts? The fact that I‚Äôve spent $100 on a game that I can‚Äôt play anymore? The fact that there are no communities who still run pre-Forsaken content regularly? If your gear isn‚Äôt up to snuff, you can forget about running content. 
---
Awesome! THanks again :D 
---
No duel needed. I didn‚Äôt realize it was posted before. If the OP wants me to delete my post I will without any problem. I apologize for the inadvertent repost.
---
I think he means matterweave, which gives you a core.

---
I don't like tattoo at all, but this looks good. 
---
I crash every other 30 mins lmao 
---
Deff get framedrops too 
---
You misspelled, "crying at every chance they get because now hunters actually got attention from Bungie"
---
And completing any prestige levei encounter has a chance at dropping the catalyst 
---
Whichever one tickles your fancy.
---
he's still there if you havent started Forsaken yet on another character
---
And even then the division is not even that similar 
---
Man, fuck getting exotics, remember getting legendaries from heroic public events?
---
24:02
---
Wow, thanks for the info! Much appreciated. I actually went over 500 this week, but the gear I really like - Sunshot hand cannon and  Sunbraces gauntlets are keeping my light level down, and I can't get any more damn enhancement cores to infuse them! Time to let those go perhaps...
---
Ohhhh! ...oh
---
Rick kackis and aztecross
---
That would xD but then people would complain about the writing...
---
Reign of the infamous poop ghost
---
Destiny needs a dark mode.
---
Coincidentally, I saw this right under a post saying how much cooler the armor was in D1 compared to D2. Your tattoo artist captured the original artwork fantastically!
---
It is you. Just you. 
---
Keep that thing oiled guardian.
---
Don't forget the iron banner, because we are under level 50 ans under 650 light (700 now) how can we Kill them if even sunbrakers need 3 hammer To take down one person.  Just hope they won't do the same to other activities
---
I don‚Äôt know what really anyone could help with, it sucks, but everyone else paid money to have access to the content we have. You‚Äôre best off waiting for a sale and buying all the dlc. Destiny has always been a game where you need to spend money to have access to the best and latest content. 
---
Get a trust/mercury 180rpm hc /Mars 180 rpm hc dude
---
This is embarrassing, about 25-30 matches.
---
And Rohan will answer!
---
And other lies you can tell on the internet 
---
Holy hell lol.
---
no, I got one additional core out of the gunsmith components. that was something my previous math hadn't accounted for, turning in the components to also shard and keep track
---
Vex...mind...?
---
I bet I die way way way way way less, like a holy fucking shit ton less then you do when fighting the primeval mate with that strategy smugface.jpg
---
Dat chaos reach with geomags keeps me safe from the architects 
---
That‚Äôs so funny, I‚Äôm not upset: far from it. I think it‚Äôs funny that you got all defensive that I said something about your attempt at trolling.  
---
Question though, you commented on a spelling mistake was that an attempt to make yourself feel better? Or your way of trying to belittle someone that just called you out on your Troll?
---
Its not actually that hard to do with practice man, I usually get to the first room around 16:45 (3min 15sec) on my hunter when Im just carrying people.
---
Kicking Faces just launched and is currently accepting all https://www.bungie.net/en/ClanV2/Chat?groupId=3712976

If people like Fortnite, let them like Fortnite.  If they want to dance in public, let them dance in public.  How does this affect you?  It doesn't, mind your own damn business dude, let people be happy.
---
Idk what playstyle I even want. Maybe a tank build? Maybe damage or cc? I don't know anything about the game so any tips would be great.
---
Go see shaxx for more punching lessons
---
As long as you remember to double tap jump (end your jump before swinging) youre good. If you single tap jump and then swing while boosting you'll get limited.
---
Shame it doesnt really make the run faster
---
It was pretty annoying for me too, maybe up your sensitivity? You got this far, you got this!
---
This animation is too clean, this has to be mocap 
---
Ok, so. I don‚Äôt cherrypick what I do, I do all the milestones, I just don‚Äôt like them. 1st. My clan does not often do raids or at least I‚Äôm not a part of them if they do, and they are who I‚Äôm most comfortable doing it with. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of lfg but yeah sometimes you gotta use it. 2nd. triumphs seals/lore, that indeed is a good way to spend time I agree, but I am trying to get the wayfinder seal, just waiting on rng stuff. I‚Äôve been getting all the lore pieces as a pastime for a while now. So I am doing those but I‚Äôd rather do nothing than some specific triumphs. 3rd. I would go for more strike specific stuff if I cared about it, I don‚Äôt like almost anything available. Yeah i don‚Äôt have all exotics, unsurprisingly, because I‚Äôve been unlucky with drops. And also I have been working on quests, like how I got last word and the see through wall bow this week, and how I am currently working on malfeasance. These quests also do not take up much time. 4th. I have other characters, I do not want to drudge through campaigns I‚Äôve done 4+ times already though, simple as that. 5th. I already said I didn‚Äôt like crucible. I did shattered throne 3 times this week, and it‚Äôs only available full curse anyway. (By events do you mean public events or live events if you mean pe‚Äôs, I‚Äôm not waisting my time having no fun with blueberries and getting no loot. If you mean le‚Äôs, yeah that is a great way to spend time. There isn‚Äôt always a live event now though, is there?) and finally, yeah, I think I am justified in complaining. I can‚Äôt get exotics I want because I‚Äôve been unlucky. I can‚Äôt do SotP because I‚Äôm too low because my light doesn‚Äôt increase much even after every week of dong every milestone. Even if I leveled my other characters, if you do milestones one one character, it gives you less to do on the next one. And, I‚Äôm waiting for stupid rng drops for a seal right now.
---
Gammatrap is another really good artist too. Great tattoo
---
You have to go to the Exotics tab in your collections in order to pull sunshot out. All your exotics are held on a different page than the legendaries. 
---
Ah, nice repost buddy, even the same punchline, how sad is that. 
---
Well, it was the tenth run in a row so I suppose it's acceptable.
---
Catalyst is meh, you reload the shotgun faster than you can fire without it.
---
I'd sign, post a link!

Hunters have the highest potential sprint speed in the game as is.
---
Trinity Ghoul :)
---
I hope the season 6 pinnacle weapon is a sidearm!
---
I wish their were different tiers for mobility that increases max sprint speed on top of the strafe speed bonuses. Right now running mobility feels kind of useless...
---
Does anyone else remember in D1 that you could see the roster as it filled up? Why did that go away? 
---
The Kill Clip one. If you get a kill and reload, by the next round you should have some bonus damage bullets.
---
Unless they already killed somebody, it does nothing but mark you so you would‚Äôve died in a scenario where they weren‚Äôt wearing it
---
YESS THE CHIKA DANCE!
---
I would happily replace every emote I had for this glorious dance. Only to be surpassed if they gave me a Jojo lean with MENACING showing up around me. 
---
Fortnite didn‚Äôt make these dances
---
You say that like it's bad thing. :) 
---
They can‚Äôt even group 4 stacks against each other or make teams based on skill so i wouldn‚Äôt hold your breath on this one 
---
Unless you feel like skipping curse of Osiris, Warmind, and the red war then use it. I personally regretted using it but that‚Äôs just me 
---
I recall getting an overshield when I used it in PvP before though 
---
isochonals only cover that first year exotics. if they're giving you repeats, you have all of the first year exotics available on that class.
---
not including rat king or the legend of arcturius
---
Is it me? I think it‚Äôs me. 
---
Stack Quickfang on top of that or MIDA
---
My last 4 have been dupes.  It‚Äôs really sad.
---
Good for you, champ. 
---
Xylem

To be fair, nobody uses top tree void titan.

Nah you're doing great precious
