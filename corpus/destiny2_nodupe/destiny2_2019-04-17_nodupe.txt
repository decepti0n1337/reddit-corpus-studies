One of the many reasons why I don't play D2 anymore.
---
---
---
Nobody cares about you either you fucking noob
---
Your fault for having a mess of an inventory mate.
---
It's active in comp? Looks like I'm never getting lunas or recluse
---
Yuh YEET
---
I run to spawn
---
Seems legit /s
---
27 wedge me in here!
---
TITAN SMASH!!!!
---
Lmao my fault I was just proud
---
I have a friend who is a hunter main, and I’m a Warlock main. He’s the only person I actually play with consistently. But anyway this friend who we will call Steve put me through hell numerous times since D2’s launch. A good 9 maybe 10 times Steve and I would hook up in orbit only for me to find out he had just restarted his Titan or Warlock. Every fucking time, I would delete my Titan I never use and run through the whole story with him again. Thankfully Steve has recognized the increase in effort each addition makes and has stopped deleting his lesser used characters. But god damn that turned into a task, we used to blow through the campaigns as fast as possible and grind the characters almost up to a decent level then go back to our mains and forget, until the cycle repeated itself.
---
thank you so much
---
Because you’re bad at it or you don’t like it? Simply said that’s your problem. Let the person try it. People say Destiny 2 is ass but you still play it correct? It’s all a matter of opinion. And anthem is definitely not the greatest but it’s still a good game and the flying is actually really well made
---
That would make sense, crooked fang is a heavy.
---
Great,  now i have to have another cry sesh.  Looks dope though.
---
No... it’s exactly how it’s supposed to be.  It works in all forms of PvP including competitive.
---

---
Bungie was extremely clear on that fact.  Not everyone’s fault you didn’t pay attention
---
You’ll never know true loss when it takes your clan 7 hours just to do gauntlet.
---
So far every time I’ve played the forest people are either afk or leave. Its annoying.....
---
Nice, my dumb fireteams leave half way through or are just plain afk the whole match...
---
Finish the Gambit Prime introductory quest.
---
You have LH and NF and you’re scared to have a little fun for a few weeks? Like put your sweaty ass guns down and try some different load outs. Oh I forgot you can’t use your dust rock and Luna’s cuz of grenades. Stale ass mf. You’re prolly the reason why crucible is ruined not these grenades.
---
Thanks yo!
---
Time to find a new clan
---
It’s a bug reload your tower
---
As a titan I speak fluent 'shut up' and also 'punch'
---
You get five for a participation reward, aside from that it’s10 or 15 per boss
---
No. You goddamn snitch
---
Yep, unfortunately I only have one on my arms though lol

Sorryyyyy
---
Stairs? What stairs?? A true hunter only jumps, and never runs
---
*casually racks up 3 stacks of combination blow with infinite dodge/melee, then two shots a daemon*
---
Uh bottom tree... sure that's the one
---
Nope. Infinite melee energy with Synthoceps.
---
Damage resistance, does 1-shot only GG
---
Most issues that were around in the beginning have been ironed out. I think it's definitely worth an attempt to join back because of how jam packed the game is with playable content. I can guarantee that coming back will provide hours and hours of fun :)
---
But honestly that was just to give you a broader answer as its asked a lot. In my opinion by far yes. If you enjoyed D1 you'll enjoy the spot D2 is in right now. I too wasn't into it at launch but now I've put in over 900 hours into it. Its the vicious cycle of Bungie putting out a garbage start to a great game.
---
Well, everything 1-shots GG, so...
---
Nope. It's Bungie.
---
yea I think I am done with destiny. I came way late, like 3 weeks ago and ive been grinding for reddix, and I don't mind this weapon, but the grenade spam. I am done. I am tired of taking 1 step forward, and 2 steps back every week with some new event.
---
not me, they are uuuuugly
---
Yeahhh, I remember D1 was terrible at launch but got amazing near the end. I was hoping at least 1 person would give me a good answer lol.
---
That was very satisfying to watch. I normally love dogs but these guys are worse than screebs.
---
The fire rate was decreased by 90%
---
Is there a point so far to keep going, or just a how far can you go type of thing?
---
I mean, it helps with all the triumphs to not have to continuously load in, but is that the only reason?

Thats ok i can pay the conversion next time i get payed, which shouldn't be long
---
To be fair, if he’s got the full invader gear and you don’t, then you shouldn’t be invading.
---
I did 140 and the timer capped at 5 mins so that would mean 60 is the max for boss time, realistically you only need 3 minutes so 30 is fine
---
So uh... what was the purpose of posting these videos?...
---
Bc it's an exotic
---
[removed]
---
That's fucking psychotic. Gg
---
Don't think so. I didn't get anything different after branch 25 than I did after branch 8.
---
That may have been what was happening. O well I finally got it done lol. Now to just farm some essence tomorrow
---
Every few branches there's a hidden chest with 5 essence so I guess the only benefit is the additional essence but probably just rerunning it at the bare minimum needed would yield better payouts in the long run
---
Gotta agree with that. Got it tonight and it feels about at the same place in the meta as OG Queenbreaker was back in Destiny 1’s meta, minus the nuts ammo values.
---
- It’s a Linear Fusion, but special. Low zoom, slightly better AA than normal snipers.
---
- Low zoom + non-intrusive scope makes for a happy Raven.
---
- It’s basically what i WISH QBB was in D2, but i’m okay with this situation. If you take time to learn the charge time/pre-charge, you can definitely match snipers.
---
What makes it not OP is that anyone who is good with a regular sniper, regular fusion, or whose primary game is strong will be able to counter Arby’s with some decent situational awareness, flinch, or some decent strafing. Like you said, good and fun, not OP.
---
big oof
---
bungie mean made my op guns useless because people just throw 5 grenades at me &gt;:( time to complain on the reddit so everyone knows how sweaty i am reeeeeeee
---
high quality meme!
---
What you want to do is find some friendly people on lfg and friend request them to do raids at a later point, by doing that I have a good, friendly raid team that clears both raids straight after reset
---
Almost mine I run malfeasance, ikelios smg, and hammerhead. I just got delirium haven’t figured out if I like it yet.
---
Your logic is not wrong except it's COMPETITIVE for a reason, no one would've cared if it was QP.  It's not so much fun if you want to make progress towards your Pinnacle weapons but get ran down by 4 tracking nades.
---
Excuse me? I'm not being a dick? I'm hardly a dick and you might wanna sort out your tone of voice i think you'll find I'm very nice on this subreddit but take this as a warning
---
Thank you - my thoughts exactly.
---
I’ll have to remember that
---
Yeah I see where you’re coming from. Once you beat it there’s no incentive. Nothing really to do. Hopefully the expansion helps it but who knows
---
Oh for sure dude it's not at all haha,  hope you enjoy yours though and congrats and getting it so fast!
---
My first package was a blue sword... RIP
---
Well maybe I like oranges
---
Oh boy ... and there I thought I could end my grind for the Ace of Spades in piece. Guess it won't be happening then in the next three weeks.
---
What a bummer, as one of the bounties is to complete five matches of crucible and gambit, and with nades all over the place ... what would be the point of those modes? Guess I will just skip those bountes then. I can get the armour pieces in different ways, afaik.
---
I think you have plenty of time with about 15 branches probably
---
It's not D2 themed but here it is: https://i.imgur.com/6XumFwu.jpg
---
Thats right...we wear our dead (or alive) enemies. Sends a strong message to our enemies.
---
It’s random. If it gave you a new exotic everytime there would be no point to Xurs fated engram and no new rolls. Exotics are random. I’ve gotten 5 liars handshakes. It happens.
---
Thats dope
---
Hopefully Bungie buffs it at some point, but very well said regardless
---
Lol 😂 Funny but great 👍 post
---
I was already using nade buff
---
Thx
---
Thanks. But, what is inking? Do I just trace over the outlines in ink pen?
---
*WHAT! WHAT? HOW?*
---
Wooo here we go, buddy!
---
I went for it because he shoots giant beams out of his body. And Doctor Strange because, well, fancy drapes. Cap would be a Titan, duh. Spider-man, hunter, 'cause of the acrobatics.
---
it's like vanguard armor- but on crucible armor
---
yes, this pleases me
---
The shattered throne?
---
Ok
---
I do think this will be a good gambit weapon though for popping enemy shields and invading/killing invaders.
---

your fuckin telling me. i switched to pc and had to start all over again. fuckin aides that crawling shit

Have you seen the it with grenadier in nightfall? It's insane and good for getting one of the triumphs.
---
Ahh ok that makes more sense. I’m going to zoom in on them next time I’m out and see if I can see the model.
---
Io on the public events
---
Just keep farming there then. They'll drop eventually.
---
and before that was mida, and before that was uriel gift and before that was matador 64, and before that was thorn....pvp has never been in a good place and i would argue it will never be
---
Reported for advertising. Get outta here dude
---
This. Is. So. Sad. Can we get an IKELIOS WEAPON
---
While I agree that there is no shortage of content, I am just saying the damn thing is too easy. Why could they have no implemented a hard mode? The haunted forest was awesome I loved it with the changing modifiers and fighting a boss after each wave. 
---
I also understand speaking from a casual standpoint, that you want to engage your whole player base. I just have a small issue with the difficulty of the adds especially when you can equip a Revelry tonic and get unlimited arc web grenades.
---
are you ready for a power move?
---
if I say thanks to you it’ll notify OP as well, i don’t have to say thanks twice

Do it somewhere else
---
One more forest run before bed i said.
---
Around wave 50 i started getting sleepy, at wave 70 all I could do was melee and dream of sleep. I really don't remember getting to 98, but our crew was so out of it we barely beat the bosses with tons of time...
---
Don't do verdant forest as your last run of the night, you will regrets
---
No lol I can post this anywhere chill
---
yes but the problem is that nowadays seems like shotguns are counters to pretty much every weapon, which shoudlnt be the case, also the fat that a special weapon shouldnt be able to best a heavy weapon so easily, swords are (in very big quotations) shotguns but worse
---
This is perfect dude. I’m totally taking this, thanks
---
I've only been playing since Forsaken; so thrown straight into the Luna/NF meta.
---
Is it even possible to be worse than it is now? I wasn't there during previous metas, so I wouldn't know.
---
From what I know, the only current counter to NF is with NF. With the exception of Bought Forgottens. Even then, at my level, they're still difficult to compete against.
---
Luna can be countered by anything with decent range.
---
The rules of this sub specifically don't allow ads. So no, you can't post this here
---
Looked like the other player was about to line up a shot to put a cap in you. Video cut off. Coincidence?
---
Still hunting mine. Care to give a mini review?
---
Otherside is a cool sparrow, but people think it is an exotic engram coming out of the vanguard chest at the end and get disappointed when it is just a sparrow
---
I got recluse from weekly bonus point
---
Treat it like a bolt-action rifle rather than a shotgun.
---
No it isn't
---
Nope, doesn't work
---
Yeah, I finished my 40 strikes yesterday running code of the missile. Was a lot of fun running skullfort and wiping out ads, but when it came to the boss I was fairly useless. I just threw some nades, cause ya know, arc singe.
---
Here's one in particular: https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/abide-the-return

Eva's Journey and Dawning Delights (lore books) also does a wonderful job of characterising Guardians. c:

Nice

*A strange light fills the room.

Put meelee tonic on and melting point constantly. Quite a helpful addition tbh
---
Anarchy cheese, Cluster bombs, lord of wolves, and one shot nighthawks.
---
*Flowey’s defence dropped to 0!
---
Probably not.   I have multiple clan mates who got all of them in less than 20 level 7s.   I have done way more than twice that and still don't have the sniper rifle.  I didn't get the shotgun until run 42 and got the sub-machine gun on run 44.   
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Nowadays getting a big enough / competent enough team to get to level 7 is pretty hit  or miss.   So I am starting to despair.
---
You are doing orgy wothout cayde? Shame
---
How? Just..... how?
---
Then I'm out of ideas.

Choosing beggar would be someone offering him an account but him declining it because it doesn't have a certain item he wants

---
I thought Rasputin was intentionally crashing them to attack the hive because he had no other way of fighting back until Ana and you turn up.
---
No. Its broken and not fun being barraged by nades every second in comp.
---
Totally worth the grind. I just wanted a weapon that could take down low tier yellow and orange bars from a safe distance without using too much ammo like the EP shotgun, and Jötunn is the perfect weapon for that. Its very good in PvE but easily avoidable by any skilled player with an IQ number higher than that on six-sided die. Overall I'd give it 8.5/10 for PvE and 6.5/10 for PvP
---
Immortal 😂
---
One of the more likeable characters. I totally felt with him when he had his lines about the destructive power of the sun-destroyer and Zavala being ignorant.
---
I was doing that yesterday as well and I accidentally punched the titan in my group off the ledge and he went flying. I died laughing from the irony 😂
---
Lol, no. Only while you are doing the Trickster mission are the Exotic engrams that drop bombs. Any other activity it is a real Exotic engram.
---
Whisper for DPS,
---
Vandals use blast furnace, bows, scouts etc
---
I know, I just dont know any other beggar subreddit
---
I'm on PlayStation but I would have found a way to join.
---
Who needs a Dance Party Key?!
---
I think I give up. Heroic 2 to brave I just cant
---
People hate pvp so much because way, way too much of it is totally predicated on whether you have certain weapons that heavily trump skill and execution differences and, probably worst of all, many of those weapons are locked behind paid dlc walls in a game with a single PvP queue regardless of your performance or your available weapons.
---
Jotunn is ridiculous, but it becomes outrageous when you realize you would have to pay for annual pass to even have a shot at having it.
---
Luna and NF are strongest, and yet you play against them even if you are miles below the skill required to acquire them, which places you at a double disadvantage on pretty much every match.
---
Adding things like Arbalest only makes the problem even worse. We are gonna shift from Luna shotgun short range meta to Luna/Arbalest I oneshot your face.
---
There’s not even variety to be had because of how overturned the TTK is, and that sorry excuse for a PvP environment actually stops PvE from going balls to the wall, which is a shame in a game where you can chain Void magic nuclear bomb levels of destruction because you are a freaking space wizard.
---
TLDR: PvP sucks.

A little late but can’t you only do 1 wish a week? And isn’t one of the wishes to spawn the eggs in the first place?
---
Happy birthday 🎂🎈
---
Happy Birthday from the /r/Destiny2 subreddit ;)
---
Needs a banana for scale
---
Development takes time and the event is free they can only give us so much while keeping it free to play.
---
Run sentinel, with doomfang, and grenade buff. The shield throw counts as a grenade, and each hit gives you super back. You can throw infinite shields.
---
Then also melting point of course.
---
"The Vangard makes my d\*\*\* hard." - Zavala, probably.
---
Based on their normal release schedule new season will probably start June 4. So get it done by June 3.
---
You typed out ‘lazy.’ Sure, there could’ve been more effort put in, but you’re being kinda hypocritical.
---
❤️
---
confused destiny emote.png
---
Happy birthday!!
---
Indeed it would!
---
I'm fine with the Revelry so far, but if they wanted to make headshots in the forest randomly drop enhancement cores, that would give most of us a really good reason to continue to run it ad infinitum.
---
How does one get the horn ornaments?
---
The fact that you can get ones you already have unlocked is a testament to Bungie's hard on for creating a pretty slot machine.
---
It is by far one of the dumbest uses of RNG I have ever experienced.
---
Sorry about that, Happy Birthday guardian! May RNGesus bless you with exotics/god rolls
---
I mean there is this great thing called google and you could have easily looked this up...
---
That'd be silly its a 200LL activity you can't make them *that* easy to obtain
---
Also the ornaments are only visible for the event
---
Just saying Titans are supposed to be the tanks Hunters are supposed to be the dps'ers
---
Well you've gotten the Arbalest now.
---
I'm not sure how much I even want to do the Revelry
---
The buff is there the whole time reverly is up, no flask needed!
---
agreed, this shouldnt be doable in comp. qp is fine.
---
get a fireteam, the 5 bosses are easy to melt.
---
As above, the effect is independent of the flask. Check your char screen!
---
Honestly it is not worth it if you are not good enough to get it yourself. The nature of the gun is that it relies on skill to be effective. Just use a trust, if you can't get it naturally then its not worth it.
---
Honestly i still use Horror Story in PvE and PvP.  It's my fav auto rifle in the game.
---
oh my bad, sorry!
---
Congratulations
---
They WONT fix it as its not broken. Its how they planned this event to go
---
How do you get this?
---
He's just dumb. My hunter is lvl 20 and I know not to blade barrage a acrstrider.
---
Happy birthday guardian!!
---
Yep! I usually throw a tier three in there and the game spits like 4 more guardians at me.
---
It only failed one time out of the dozens of times I’ve done it.
---
Which of these can you not do?  even with no DLC you still have access to the forest, strikes, crucible, Leviathan.
---
1) Spring Cleaning - Clear branches in the forest
---
2) 200 Orbs in Gambit OR Crucible 
---
3) 200 orbs in a Strike or Raid
---
4) 200 orbs in the forest OR black armory 
---
5) kill 3 bosses in one run
---
6) kill 20 bosses (multiple runs) wearing 4 event armor pieces 
---
7) Kill enemies with a super in any activity
---
8) grenade kills in Strikes, Crucible OR Gambit
---
9)Melee kills in the Forest OR Forges
---
10)Complete bounties
---
The Cayde-6 seal of approval.
---
Then f*ck off and come back in three weeks whilst the rest of us have fun spamming grenades. Or here's a tip. Try pve. There's a whole world out there
---
My wrost was all 18 runs of atheon i did back in d1 all gave me the shader and nothing else. no weapons, armor, sparrow, ship, nothing. Just the shader. Its a large reason why i quit d1. D2 feels so much better though.
---
I think it’s a very good weapon for pvp if you have a weapon like the recluse to back it up but in pve it isn’t worth the exotic slot as it functions similarly to a sniper rifle
---
actually suprised not seeing anything about the 3 week ornaments :D
---
Someone got bullied by spectral blades lmao
---
You also get time for killing the ads in the boss fights, so it's not particularly difficult to kill all five bosses after wave 10.
---
Nope you can do as many as you want.  Though after you do the egg wish + a teleport wish you will have redo the wishes.
---
There's a really low chance of getting the head ornaments, I got the antlers but even then they go away after the event
---
[This one ?](https://media1.tenor.com/images/afb04f2232d9f22b410ad7f7e2ddaf4a/tenor.gif?itemid=5382089)
---
dawnblade is pretty great though, definetly top 3 supers for pvp
---
Yeah we got shafted timer ran out. Ended up farming it for the achieve for the exotic, just made sure to start from behind instead got it done pretty quick.
---
I'd hope he's one of the ones who took advantage of the masterwork core glitch. Otherwise that's such a waste. Master working armor, especially this crap set, isn't worth it.
---
Thanks much appreciated. I’m playing Juggernaut Titan and the other two are Void Warlock and Arc Hunter, but I think they might be switching up soon. We’re new to Destiny and the game has a bit of learning curve for class builds.
---
is it fun sitting in a lane waiting for someone to walk into your sights?
---
I was only doing that cause I didn't want to make our team be down by more points from me dying.
---
Theres a rly easy way to get the triumphs, go into the corrupted strike in the dreaming city, don't go into the temple, instead go to the left, follow the path back to the starting area and use the metric ton of spawns for headshots
---
Where does badlander drop?
---
Well uh...You see....Luna is a energy and Shotgun‘s take Special too..
---
So!! You can now see why...
---
F\*ck  
---
sorry  
---
Read our rules before posting.
---
And take this shit elsewhere.
---
Arguement? Lol. I played with bad teams with 1.5+ kds and they played worse than teammates ive had with 1.1 kds. You can get 2 kills going Rambo and die in elimination and since they both get revived it is a detriment. Ancedotal maybe but its just what happened guy. I shared my experience and you got angry. Didnt mean to trigger you. Good luck lol.
---
ohh yeah ive seen that a few times while solo queueing
---
That’s not how this format works.
---
Sagira has the "crazy eyes"
---
But no one came
---
They are not too bad, but they shine in the Crucible, especially void hunter.
---
It’s temporary quit complaining.
---
You do you man, rock those pajamas B)
---
The better team always wins. You may just be bad at that mode and need to improve?
---
spoilers dude, its been what 2 days???? what an egg

I have it on my long good bye which has snapshot and dragonfly, I like it.

I want the SMG

*YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DESTROY THE SITH, NOT JOIN THEM!*

If you're trying to incite I'm being contradictory for my comment, you're making no sense. You're not offering an opinion. If you had just commented saying you think it's the best thing to happen in PvP, that'd be giving your opinion. Saying 'oh shut the fuck up' is just fucking stupid
---
IKR absolutely no respect for the dead
---
Don’t take it to school or work to show your colleagues lol...
---
I’m playing on console. Backup mag only adds one round. Doesn’t seem worth it.
---
The empty swing was too perfect
---
This is hilarious but I'm personally enjoying Destiny 2 way more than I did the first one.
---
This is me for escalation protocol (still no shotgun), I've been pretty lucky with blind well though
---
The chest by itself with bloody tooth as the shader isn't half bad.
---
That's not why they're mad. It's because they chalk up the work of a 200 man team and gave sole credit to her. Although some of it has to do with people being afraid of a woman doing science lmao
---

Thanks! Now I just need to grind out the quest steps, but at least I don't need to worry about winning anymore.
---
You might want to use the Devour tree for the melees...i finished it easy with that...
---
I threw up in my mouth a little bit
---
I saw this image on the Apex Legends page before, and thought: Awe, her first win (and... how the hell did that laptop run Apex).
---
I just saw this image now, and thought: Wow, she plays Destiny too...

oh, wait..
---
I ordered the last word awhile back, should I have gotten it yet?

Technically they haven’t made any new ones recently, just bringing sexy back
