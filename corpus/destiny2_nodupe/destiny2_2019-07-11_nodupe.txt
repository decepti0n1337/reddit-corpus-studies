Nope just hammered
---
---
---
Yeah the well broke as hell for the past three or four days
---
My 4stack yesterday had something similar.
---
2 of the guys on the other team left after we were up 50 points or so.
---

---
We just danced with one of the guys left, while the 2nd dude remaining kept potshotting us from miles away.
---
I think we used 5 supers on him.
---
This isn‚Äôt the comp that I know. There‚Äôs no tea-bagging. What parallel universe is this?
---
It‚Äôs on the roof in castellum near cup. There‚Äôs not a barrier and you can jump onto a small hole in the wall. And viola, your glitched now
---
Lol maybe
---
Yeah, I always tell my clan never to kill lone players or 2 players unless of course, they want to fight lol. Still we either 1v1 or 2v2 depending. Also, clan rules, we never tea-bag unless someone starts it first.
---
SeArChBaR
---
Yes, it is known by bungo
---
I used it and nothing came up wanna link it?
---
So transcharacter?
---
I play pvp only for a certain exotic I have no hope of getting. Getting stuck on teams full of AFK bots and against teams full of cheese and what I sometimes expect are either aim hacks or some kind of auto aim controller exploit on PC. It has me so pissed I can't even play the game now.
---
I would rather play CSGO comp and deal with that insanity than play destiny 2. At least people on CSGO actually communicate. NOT ONE person in 50 matches I played had any interest in communicating. 
---
In short, I hate people.
---
Don't you also have a button to take screenshots with?
---
Sounds like Shadow Rifts opening during Escalation Protocol.
---
The stuff of myth triumph is for recluse not Mountaintop
---
most likely this
---
Indeed
---
Moon's haunted.
---
I have to say, I do envy the Sunbreaker‚Äôs infinite throwing hammer melee.
---
Perhaps you need your ears checked. I know a guy in the Tangled shore. Excellent doctor, questionable methods, but he gets the job done.
---
Your Crucible team in New Light:
---
And who, might I ask, is he?
---
Had the same glitch. Would sometimes turn the players the same texture as well ;-; , wouldn't fix itself until the game ended...
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm trying to do it in 2 nights so I can raid with my squad Saturday lol
---
Your Mom.
---
You're trying to get 750 in 2 nights?
---
Oh ok,I just had a bit of hope it would work but thx for clarifying
---
A man can dream!
---
Yeah that wont happen hahaha
---
I‚Äôll give you the update Saturday so you can laugh at my pain hahaha
---
Alright sounds good ü§£
---
Oh *please,* name ONE titan that actively influences the game story/gameplay wise besides Zavala and Shaxx.
---
(Nice burn btw)
---
I'll buy those tinctures, I can only hold 5 though :/
---
God-rolled Supremacy is the only one on your list that is rare.
---
Saint-14, Saladin, Taeko-3, Rezyl Azzyr....
---
Shall I continue?
---
It‚Äôs like a rocket jump, except the Titan just punches the ground to take off
---
Wait, we're a clan that cares! We have a Psychiatrist Lounge, people really use it in our clan.
---
Awww!
---
I like it! There needs to be more green., tho. Nice work!
---
For anyone who has not done the quest yet, before you place the first tribute switch characters and place the tribute using an alt. Then return to orbit and load back in and place the tribute again. Rinse and repeat until you reach 50. You can monitor progress with triumphs under destinations&gt;the tribute hall.
---
Thank you, very good answer
---
Depends on how much other stuff you do/did.
---
We went up against a poor guy that had his whole team leave, we ended up feeding him fighting lion kills for his mountain top quest.
---
/u/raydobbsy53 TRAMPSTAMP

Well I‚Äôm completely out of everything. Bright dust, shards, planetary materials etc soooo...
---
Exotics can be anything. There‚Äôs no limits to it, every other legendary piece of gear has to be from menagerie or crown
---
F. A solid F.
---
Well since I have nothing, I‚Äôm screwed
---
The Taken King marches on Quria‚Äôs Hydra-hull, armed with blade and magic, cloaked in ancient cloth, and the universe wails in horror around him. Quria‚Äôs physics models and toy worlds choke and crash.
---
Quria observes, alert and attentive, as a single quark splits on the tip of Oryx‚Äôs sword.
---
From within the Hydra-hull, Quria‚Äôs tiny not-Oryx speaks. ‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù it says. It‚Äôs manifesting terror and awe.
---
Oryx‚Äôs eyes blaze with a curiosity that is entirely isomorphic with hate, with voracious hunger. ‚ÄúAurash,‚Äù he says, in his Hive language. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve made me as I was. You‚Äôve made a tiny Aurash. Ha!‚Äù
---
Quria updates the simulation‚Äôs name. Aurash is curious: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre me? You‚Äôre me as I become?‚Äù
---
Oryx kneels. His blade is on his left shoulder. Quria is firing every available weapon at him, but his wards don‚Äôt break. He looks into Quria‚Äôs sensors through the hammering fire and he says, ‚ÄúChild, I have everything you wanted. I am immortal. I know the great secrets of the universe. I have scouted the edges of the Darkness and I have chased the lying god down galactic arms in a howling pack of moons. In my fist I carry the secret power that will rule eternity. In my worm I bear the tribute of my Court and of my children, the Hope-Eater, the Weaver, and the Unraveler; and with this tribute I smash my foes. I am Oryx, the Taken King. I am almighty.‚Äù
---
Quria samples the Taox intelligence retrieved from the Ecumene gate. There are useful names. It feeds them to the simulation.
---
‚ÄúWhat about your sisters?‚Äù Aurash asks his future self. ‚ÄúSathona? Xi Ro? Are they with you?‚Äù
---
The Taken King‚Äôs fangs glint. That sound might be a laugh, or a hiss.
---
Quria shuts down its weapons and puts all its spare resources into sending telemetry to the greater Vex. There will be points in space and time where this data is vital. There will be great projects undertaken in the study of this ontological power, this throne-space.
---
‚ÄúWhere are my sisters?‚Äù Aurash shouts. ‚ÄúWhat have you done with my people? What have you done?‚Äù
---
But Oryx‚Äôs fist is full of black fire, and the next thing Quria sees is a light like stars.
---
This is a piece of End of Failed Timeline from the taken king grimoire in Book of Sorrows.
---
The spider will be your friend
---
Yeah we need dedicated servers.
---
I like the idea that it would blind enemies like the helm, that could be really cool.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just a scannable that‚Äôs close to the surface in the edz. That weird scannable has been there since day 1 of scourge and no one has actually been able to find it
---
Full value armor set. No exotics on armor. Take in acrius and/or tarrabah in there to be safe.
---
Calus themed = from the Leviathan
---
Calus themed exotics would be legend of acrius, tarrabah, and bad juju. [A long list of legendary and exotic guns that count.](https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cbbuhf/calusthemed_weapons_and_what_counts/)
---
I used full Opulent Gear, Austringer, Calus-Mini Tool, and Acrius
---
Yes. They are all free quests. The pinnacle weapons for everything are available to everyone
---
What blasphemy is this?!?!
---
No as big as consoles but still there
---
You masterwork it yourself, stinky
---
It had it‚Äôs bed moments.  I‚Äôm looking at you Curse of Osiris.  But it‚Äôs come back from being garbage (still fun but man was it bad) to being the game we all loved on Destiny 1.  I have very high hopes for Shadowkeep.
---
üòî looks like I'm waitin
---
You can indeed, might be a little hard though but good luck
---
Don't know why people are downvoting you, just buy the ultimate pack (I think thats what it's called) on the battle.net launcher
---
Ah shit
---
where are u supposed to get all of those people
---
I‚Äôm buying forsaken complete edition and annual pass, but is the annual pass worth it?
---
THIS.
---
I actually really like Survival now, in large part *because it is NOT COUNTDOWN. * 
---
I'm dying for a Titanfall 2-style 'mixtape' style matchmaker so I can banish it.
---
Frank azar!
---
Wait that's not it
---
Always that one person who is super delayed.
---
LFG
---
If money isn't an issue, annual pass is very worth it
---
Ok thanks.
---
I can't even get it upgraded past tier 2 because randoms don't know how to do tier 2 reckoning
---
I managed to complete moments of triumph in d1 easily but man did they up the challenge on d2 moment of triumphs. The fact that I need to get 1 pinnacle wep from crucible is just unmotivating for me as well as gambit. Guess I'll miss out on most of the rewards this year.
---
I'm kinda fine with it haha
---
No worries never really liked the perk in the past but the machine gun already feels good stock so the extra ammo is nice ricochet rounds is pretty nice too gives u range and stability
---
He might be doomed with style!
---
Still using huckle tho, because string of curses last a bit shorter i feel.
---
Might switch completely after getting the catalyst tho.
---
Yeah but I don‚Äôt have the app and don‚Äôt know the password to the email connected to my account
---
This whole clip I was waiting for you to use your super and kill all of them
---
So just cuz titans arent as good in raids mean they suck?
---
I'd rather not
---
Childish Gambino.

I tried that today, got blade barraged buy multiple people every timeüòÇ
---
God this screenshot is giving me violent year one flashbacks
---
Yeah that's a common bug that has been around for at least a year. It will actually cycle between all the class poses.
---
Was just on d1 and things for the hunter looked crazy, meanwhile d2 theyre kinda lacking and dull. I think the old shader system would be great for these because its so annoying to grind out bumble bee or brick blood.
---
He ascended to a higher plane of being.
---
Very lucky. I'm still heroic 2
---
And i will tell him "no, you died because you were too stupid to blow the fucking prison up and try to kill eight undead fallen barons on your own, did you forget who the chosen one was?"
---
We just have to have patience. We were all kinderguardians at one point.

put tethers down around every corner so you can't be killed by the most bullshit panic super in game

IMO that's the point and I'm all for it  they are supposed to be amazing like an exotic but not take up the slot

doitsu no kagaku wa sekai ichi

Not just the best SMG but arguably the best primary (excluding outbreak but that's only for boss DPS).
---
Omg this restored my faith in humanity
---
Dude you didn't kill him, check the feed. He just melee'd you from behind.
---
Brand new WIP for these nibbas like slavery
---
I would say it's worth it, you only need 18 tributes to unlock the mission and the mission can be done solo. The gun is fun to use.
---
It should just only proc when u kill with the recluse just make it have a slightly longer up time then kill clip
---
Of course a titan using one eyed also has wardcliffe lmao
---
#mountaintop
---
Also several dreaming city missions are bugged all to hell
---
One Two Punch, it's a unique shotgun perk that can currently only roll on Last Man Standing or the shotgun from Crown of Sorrow. The perk increases your melee damage significantly for about 1.5 seconds when you shoot an enemy and hit them with all the pellets in said shot. It stacks with all other melee buffs and gets quite ridiculous.
---
Wadu
---
You're doing a great job my friend
---
Yeah it happens. All you have to do is get the whole fireteam to sit in the purple void spikes and wipe.

Non PS4 people are probably very confused reading this.

The fact that you had to link that here.....disturbs me.

Aww heck yeaha

Make bubble have same effect as ray to the flag = titans useful in endgame

Probably. But only a true disgrace wouldn‚Äôt utilize every subclass ability when the supers are meh. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yah mad posts on this lately its affecting everyone. Not sure why ppl are still doing the blind well though? New player maybe seed of light?
---
Restaurant burned down? Fuck you pay me.
---
I‚Äôm convinced. Where can I get it?
---
 Get your machine gun, Guardian. The HEAVY machine gun.
---
Oh boy, another way to escape the map. I‚Äôm gonna abuse this!
---
You can‚Äôt shoot any enemies or escape. If you do this you are stuck. Unless you‚Äôre teammates win the match for you, you‚Äôll be stuck till the end of time.
---
Same face after using it the first time
---
Not all of us can play enough to sweat all over spider for materials lmaoooo. GG tho at least someone‚Äôs gettin shit done.
---
LOL!
---
Definitely your network, oh man Deej is that you? Lol. Every connection error, bug and crash says its our networks. Hahah really, it's shoddy code and bungie know it hence they even named their bugs and errors ffs.
---
You can play a million stable hours in any game and try Destiny 1 or 2 and get disconnected due to it being "your network"
---
(great you don't have any issues but trust me, disco and errors are based on RNG too)
---
Oh right i tottally forgot about the curse thank you :)
---
Some teams are straight up awful and refuse to even play the objective. I‚Äôve been on so many comp teams where I was the *only* player to capture a zone or defend a charge. 
---
I have no qualms about quitting these teams.
---
My warlocks name is brick and she is the prettiest

Switch characters, happens to nearly everyone.
---
The first game is on them, the next 2 are on you.

Why would you continue when there's a known bug happening?
---
How? Grinded solo for lunas and recluse. need to hit fabled for MT. And im bored
---
Well now don't be too hasty lol I'm going to make a piece like this for EVERY subclass and alternative super. Hunters next so you might feel the need to play THAT as well lol. But they're ALL getting my attention! And as far as doing time lapse videos, I mean just be motivated and inspired, film yourself making something, speed it up in post and upload it :) then you're golden!

That Skank gang is still a threat.

Gang gang.

So you knew it was broken and continued to play?

kinderguardians and their white engrams
---
I‚Äôm aiming to tick 1 million. I‚Äôm so very near 700k right now in pve. I don‚Äôt need to fight guardians. I need to save the universe. From itself. Lol
---
Can I buy tributes up to 45? Or would I at some point HAVE to do gambit?
---
Um,..... what?
---
Should of been a purple vapour. Idk who lets these things through
---
Bad Juju be hittin that Bad Juul
---
I like that emote, but - a long time? Only been out 2 days.
---
Isn't the Bad Juju catalyst part of the tribute set as well? That any good?
---
True, but the Hunter‚Äôs need a vanguard, and running away sure isn‚Äôt helping.
---
Also, there‚Äôs a difference between running away and taking the offensive.
---
This happened to me as well yesterday once the other team noticed we had a little yoga class in the middle of the map.
---
Well thank you very much! I'm trying my best over here lol
---
Simple fix.

Gotta love cheesing ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Indeed, I message a lot of people asking for help with my recluse grind and very few respond. Solo queuing is a fucking nightmare, idk if I'll ever get recluse or not
---
no one knows, least not any of my friends and they are almost done with all the triumphs. Most likely it is gonna be tied with the Solstice of Heroes event thats in like 2 weeks.
---
https://youtu.be/umDr0mPuyQc
---
Just cheese it save your time and materials
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure if it was cheating they would ban you. This is not cheating because you aren‚Äôt impeding any other guardians ability to play/enjoy the game, similar to the cheese in Skourge or last wish or even the zero hour mission. It‚Äôs bungo‚Äôs fault not ours so why not benefit from it?
---
Well. To find groups. LFG'ing for parties is good. If your on Xbox, use their LFG system there. If your on other platforms try using 3rd party sites or use Bungie's companion app LFG System. Trying Discords is good as well. (I'm mostly unknowledgeable here since I use LFG's) Then find out why your getting kicked. Is it a lack of knowing how to do activities? Is it your gear? What is it? 
---
After your done with these activities ask the people to play again. If they say no then move on to the next group. No harm if they dont.
---
*laughs in Lunas howl*
---
There is a website destiny raid report where u can look up a gamertag and see completions of raids. If you dont have alot some groups may not want to have you on their squad. Like the other post said, LFG with the companion app is a good choice. There are ppl there willing to help. There is also a guided game option in the game itself where a clan would teach you the raid. You would just have to wait in the queue
---
All I ask is for the Boolean Gemini to come back üò¢
---
what is this.
---
"Calus demands that you pay for your own tribute"
---
Outbreak Perfected.
---
Both proc a similar effect when stacking rounds into a target. Malfeasance's lore even implies using multiple ones to quickly kill a target like what gets done with Outbreak.
---
ok
---
Jesus, just hold down two flags instead of playing ring around the roses with flags.
---
Faction Rally?
---
Can you please, for the love of god, google "Destiny 2 comp issues" for like 10 seconds before coming to the sub to post? If you spent even 10 seconds googling, you would come across this:
---
https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/252779454?sort=0&amp;page=0
---
Its been talked about EXTENSIVELY and putting in even minimal effort would have answered your question.
---
Me in QP: Hey guys, every time we take a zone, it immediately gets contended...maybe 2 of us should stay in a zone after we capture it and let them come to us?
---
Blueberries: No, I don't think we will.
---
Uhh nothin
---
No. Plugged in.
---
Triumphs, destinations, minor, tribute hall, Golden offering.

Your post is trash, and you are trash. Go away forever please.

Oh.

Kthnxbye

You can put mats in your vault?
---
I feel the same, last I checked I was just shy of 600k a few weeks ago. Me, Huckleberry and Skullfort ain't ever gonna stop.
---
Guess who did the same with a hunter? This guy did.
---
I mean is there a reason you are incapable of doing that? Is there a reason you need us for this?
---
Thanks Capt.! I got paired against the guy who made all the weapon pins in the bottom right, Vanguard Armory Pins. felt bad beating him, very nice guy, but i did give him quite a bit of business after we won haha
---
"I have been falling for 30 minutes!" -Loki
---
The most common issue is that people haven't finished the quest, but were not aware there was still another step. You can view quest progress in the pursuits tab at the top of the director.
---
The thing that confuses most people is that the quest says to "claim the menagerie triumphs." What this means is you go to the triumphs tab at the top of the character menu and then go to destinations &gt; minor &gt; menagerie and claim the triumphs by clicking on them. Then you will be able to do what the next quest step says.
---
You do need to finish the main campaign, but if you go fast through it it really will probably only take *maybe* 20 hours to get through Red War, Osiris, and Forsaken campaigns total - especially if you grab a friend. (Forsaken may require a bit more work as it‚Äôs designed for higher power compared to the other campaigns, and unlocking the third trees on your subclasses takes more work.)
---
Something to keep in mind is that a lot of the best weapons/gear aren‚Äôt found in Crucible. You‚Äôll be wanting to do endgame quests and activities to get good gear. Also, in order to reach max power level, you‚Äôll have to grind weekly milestones which is primarily pve. (Power level doesn‚Äôt matter in PvP except during the Iron Banner, but that mode has special rewards and is a favorite of many people so players who are lower power are at a big disadvantage to compete in that.)
---
Destiny heavily focuses on pve as the primary activity, so once you hit a certain point you can definitely just do PvP, but until you‚Äôve gotten the gear you want, you‚Äôll likely have to do some pve.
---
The gold one does, and it fits with my all gold look
---
Rip my homies who bought the other one
---
I'll have to check out those artists thanks
---
I don't know why you think nothing was wrong with it or nobody hated it, I have only met *one* person who actually had no complaints about faction rallies. 
---
They were essentially "endlessly grind lost sectors again and again for 30+ copies of identical weapons" week long events. The only time they were ok is if you weren't seriously attempting to get that many tokens.
---
If you "let them have" one zone, and are successfully defending the other two, then you:
---
 A. Know where your opposition is
---
 B. Know where your teammates are (supposed to be)
---
 
---
There's also the idea I've been having to try to defend the nearest zone uncapped. See how long it stays uncapped. I imagine seeing it actually a thing. A timer on that mechanic would put some pressure on doing things differently.  It would potentially require more skill to in essence make the map a two zone field, if a team could defend well enough. I wanna try this out some how. 
---
This is all just us chattering on for now though. We have what we have...
---
Have you checked CPU and GPU usage while playing?
---
Maybe V-Sync was enabled due to a reset of settings following the driver update?
---
You need to get the Loot Crate Ghost pin.
---
I believe the original saying is actually "exacts", not "extracts", but it still works, lol.
---
Btw, [F].
---
This has definitely happened to me with a 4 streak just to twist the knife.
---
News flash: people die in strikes sometimes. You know, because the game is actually trying to make you die. If someone dies twice in a strike, you're not justified to say git gud to them. Doesn't mean they're not a good player. Just means you're acting like an elitist asshole.
---
Also, I would bet your mother's scrotum you've died hundreds of times in strikes. So take the sack out of your mouth and stop this world of make believe you're trying to convince others that you live in.
---
thank
---
Exaxtly how i got my 125% healed game
---
ah yes because it's so hard to do heroic events especially now and you do lost sectors so much normally you got 29+ from a nightfall you didn't have to do lost sectors at all and they should be brought back
---
Lol i was too when i saw the kills and then i cheked the percent healed and i was even more surprised
---
Yeah I have been off for a while
---
The reason many people focused on lost sectors was because speedrunning lost sectors was by far the fastest way to get tokens, and many people wanted to get enough tokens for the catalysts and stuff.
---
I haven‚Äôt played in a year so it makes sense
---
It doesn‚Äôt track in the sense that truth tracks. When it bounces, it bounces towards the nearest enemy . If it hits you, it‚Äôs because you didn‚Äôt have time to move out of the way of its trajectory
---
Content and mindless repetition are 2 different things
---
I only used 200ish dusklight and phaseglass the test I got by doing stuff
---
Where are all these emotes coming from?
---
Was stupid would recommend
---
I played a lot of destiny 1 ... And missed my eyasluna... this is identical to the eyasluna thats why i like it so much
---
I dont see this as mindless repitition. Maybe you do. Just remember u didn't pay for this its free so take it or leave it. Exploit it or not. But don't show off an exclusive emblem thats kinda hard to get if you didn't work for it . ppl will see right through
---

Does she ground pound to fly? Am i missing something?
---
odd you should be at 690, then when you do your weekly tasks they can bump you up to 735-740 really quick, takes about 2-3 weeks after that to get to 750 depending on luck.  There are rumors of another boost to 770 when solstice hits (like last year).
---
She straight up punches the ground and takes off in one of the most recent episodes
---
How is that?
---
That's fortunate. I can't say I didn't know how useful the kill feed was until I didn't have one. Now every super around I hear frightens me, even if it ends up being my own teammate.
---
I've been letting them stack up to binge later

I think you had a stroke but yes. I am currently getting carried but i lost my sanity a long time ago

i've done 6

Relax guardian you're scaring them
---
Check postmaster for the thingys, if u have full inventory they go there
---
Yes, the game has shit netcode, but I was giving my first-hand anecdotal experience that while their shitty code kept booting me, changing my network configuration *did* fix the problem.

Bungie should fix their game, but putting your head in the sand and saying it's their fault so they should fix it just means you're stuck getting weaseled all day.

True North Shell from The Dawning with the Hakke History Polish shader.

How? They literally spoon feed you 690 gear. There is 10 plus powerful rewards everyday? I didn‚Äôt even try to level to 750 and I‚Äôm stirring at 736 just by fucking around in Gambit and strike playlist
---
Oh yeah I‚Äôm on PC. I can imagine it would be pretty hard to use on console

I'm assuming you're fairly new. God roll is the term for the best possible set of perks on a weapon or armor. These rolls tend to stand out against other weapons and perform very well and consistently. For example, an Austringer hand cannon with Full Bore, Accurized Rounds, Eye of the Storm or Outlaw, Rangefinder, and a range masterwork is extremely consistent in PvP and kills at its best time to kill at a long range for hand cannons, so it's a pvp God roll.
---
There's often also separate God rolls for PvE, usually stuff like outlaw and rampage on primaries, full auto and trench barrel on shotguns, rapid hit and triple tap on snipers, fourth times the charm and firing line on the gambit prime sniper, etc.

The 60$ edition has the annual pass

I've had it for a few seasons but it's fantastic for ad clear.

Legendary? As in purple?
---
Yes
---
It's definitely in collections. It's part of the Titan devastation complex set
---
Yeah I‚Äôm new. So you‚Äôre saying to play menagerie in luck to get a God roll? If I don‚Äôt have any good runes?
---
Not related but cool name
---
It wasn‚Äôt loading on my screen and I looked through the collections at first but thx I found it now.
---
You can set waypoints, but only to pre-existing locations that have a flag or icon on them. You are talking about CUSTOM waypoints.
---
I don't really see the need for this honestly. If you have played since launch like I have, you should know the maps well enough to not need this. The only time a waypoint would have been helpful would have been the werner chests and stuff like that, but even then, those weren't hard to find.
---
I simply don't think a waypoint system is needed in this game as the world is not vast enough to have the need for custom waypoints.
---
Go into menagerie only when you have runes you want to spend unless you need it for a quest. Each rune combo (provided you use either 2 or 3 runes) guarantees a specific weapon or piece of armor, but the perks on it are random. [Here's a spreadsheet that shows what each combo gives you](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_aEsIfZArOUJ0_Z7NLnV3SpzXLiHOe5NaOHUd9tUlRw/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#)

Not a bug, the season of opulence updated buffed the PvE damage of overcharged by bullets by 100% and increased the max stacks of sturm overcharge to 99
---
Because the damage off tether is shared between the targets, if you hit one with a GL and the other dies from shared damage, it's not a GL kill it's a "kill from tether damage"

Watch the YouTube channel chase the heat. That guy will give you some inspiration.

Solo to 3k+ glory. Idk what you mean reward teamwork man. Team? What's that? Just carry your team like a goddamn semi truck. Or you know, have friends unlike me :(

You can never have to many 'splodes, but a neutral game buff would be dope.

Give it another month and you won't be. Especially doing breakneck. Source: Player who got Forsaken in February and had the exact same mindset as you.

Cross save is not currently available, but it will be when the new dlc comes out in September, for now I would recommend playing on Xbox and getting all your characters leveled up if you want to play the new dlc when it comes out, and then make the switch to PC when the cross save feature comes out
---
Has to be same gear set

Was doing the Inverted Spire strike in playlists last night, doing this and the ability kills one. Everything was going great, not even close to dying yet, having a good time. Get to the point where you take the last engine thing across the gap and have to jump to not almost break your legs and die after. Game decided it wasn't okay for the quest to be completed. Big orange barrier came up and all of us feel into the gap and died. Always thought it'd be the blueberries who'd sabotage me and not the game itself.

Just get the collection

I cheesed 50 tributes, hopped into my main character and got the bad juju and then the catalyst
