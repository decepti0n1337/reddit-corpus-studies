As if this place is any better.

Well, it is. But barely.

He is worthy!

Don't cross the streams
---
Pc player here. I fucking hope so. and weapons aswell, im getting tired of holding the same origin story copy.
---
I‚Äôve started to play Destiny 2 this summer and i have to say that Gambit is a really good mode and the result of the match can quickly change in few seconds.
---
Follow the objectives, once you‚Äôve done the whole set visit tower again to upgrade to next set then rinse and repeat.
---
Too bad the speed/distance is affected by framerate. Console players get the satisfaction of doing it, not much zoom.
---
How ornaments work is they first appear in a box you have to manually open. This is so that you can get a refund if you wish. I believe it shows up in the "modifications" tab of the inventory.
---
What fusion rifle is that?
---
Range is any of the green runes.
---
Cool, so you're the the team I'm playing every other game.
---
Don‚Äôt cross the streams!!
---
The two seasonal crucible ones
---
I sharded my one two punch shotty not knowing what it was :(
---
Wizened rebuked w Rangefinder underpressure
---
I see.  Very cool.  Wonder what that will be like.
---
Can I get uuuuuuh..  lil context.
---
There's a limit.
---
A. Thats the playerbases problem because of corporate greed. Bungie still made out like bandits selling a game that was advertised as an mmofps that had literally NO GAMEPLAY LOOP until they brought back the shit that was original to destiny 1 and released THREE. FULLY PAID. DLCS.
---
B. Theres no reason they cant strive to make reparations, except that that would require Bungie admitting that it was wrong and shit all over their playerbase. Shit like "Arc week" where they do shit like BASIC, SIMPLE NUMBERS ADJUSTMENTS, is not a reparation, its literally sticky notes at the nottom of whats supposed to be ACTUAL, CONSISTENT PATCHES AND BALANCE CHANGES.
---
Inb4 classic "durhur armchair dev" response. (Not from you personally, just in general.) If you guys are okay with giving bungie 250$ for a video game You guys are gonna go straight into debt when you play literally any other MMO that has ever existed and find out the people that make the game actually give a fuck about their playerbase and the game itself and arent just in it for the money, as has been proven time and time again from bungie. Source: apparently bungies earnings reports, literally years of eververse controversy as evidenced by the consistent state of the bungie forums FOR YEARS at this point, multiple major media outlets (literally just google destiny 2 bad or YongYeas videos covering the major media coverage for specific case by case examples.), etc etc
---
Right now you can go up to 380 by doing challenges that refresh each week and give "Powerful Gear." I believe all players have access to: 
---
* Gain xp for your clan (see the LFG megathread linked in the subreddit header for recruiting clans)
---
* Crucible
---
* Gambit 
---
* Strikes
---
* Nightfall
---
* Flashpoint (hover over a planet NPC whose planet has the gold circle icon)
---
* Eva Levante's package opening challenge for Solstice of Heroes
---
Crucible, strikes, whatever shows up on the director.
---
sicc
---
Anyone else never touched Gambit mode here?
---
Hope so
---
You keep saying "disable" do you mean enable?
---
Thanks brother
---
What problem? Im on pc and im playing on the 13th.
---
Ive suffered so much recently, im a newer player, been about a month. No one i know wants to play gambit with me, because they all already got the seal. Meanwhile, i join a team where im one of two people and were getting stomped and teammate says just throw. Gambits filled with bots and four stacks and its been a living hell trying to solo que.
---
You‚Äôre going to be 750 in October no matter what
---
Wish I even had a raid team. No one in my clan plays anymore‚òπ
---
Oh im very familiar with how complicated programming is. I used to help with a friends private server for WoW back in the day, got too expensive so we eventually called it off, im not claiming its not difficult, im claiming Bungie doesnt give a fuck, and it wouldnt matter even if it WAS as easy as flipping a switch. They cant even be bothered to do basic, consistent, balance/meta patches (literally just numbers tuning), let alone BIG stuff in a timely manner like wardcliffe/fusion rifle ammo glitches or instance farming lost sectors for infinite faction rally tokens, etc etc. Theyre too busy figuring out how little content they can get away with selling for the most.
---
F
---
Yeah same here. My accuracy with a sniper seems to significantly improve when invading and I always seem to have some form of success hunting the enemy invader yet I‚Äôm utter shite in crucible
---
Pretty much nailed it lol
---
It‚Äôs a glimmer bank.
---
There's a link in the description. Can't you read?
---
Boy you just added that. 
---
Edit: he just added it. Sorry if I seemed a bit harsh but there was originally no link, so I was asking to see his POV as he said it was there in the title.
---
he took 2 vitamin gummies
---
the whole thing leading up to that ending was a clusterfuck
---
Anarchy does a ton of damage but you get it from the SOTP raid.
---
I love this
---
i know they are, but its not enough when about 50% of the time you get ppl standing afk at spawn, doing left,right,jump and shoot once(macro) the whole match. sometimes i even got the exact same guy doing it again eventho my whole team reported him a week ago.
---
i know ppl do this cause they hate gambit but want the powerdrop, had ppl in my old clan bragging how they went afk in gambits all the time for the breakneck quest too.
---
Thanks!
---
That's not even the poster...?
---
*"I am the one and only ArcaneSword! Your blade is weak in the eyes of the master!"*

Shuro chi encounter with top tree voidhunter. Should save a few minutes :)

black, and white&amp;gold
---
[removed]
---
It‚Äôs got some real WH40K vibes, I like it!
---
Oh yeah you're right and thank you :)
---
You choose one account to be an account for all systems so if you choose your PS4 as the primary one you should be able to play on PC.
---
I've been carefully tearing off the front and back covers of my old mags and putting them in a scarp book. Be too much of a shame to toss away good pictures.
---
r/warocksplzstaydown
---
The drop rate is pretty good on Jotunn, but you need all four forges unlocked, and you need a powerful frame ready to forge. No matter what forge it says to complete it at, go to Bergusia and complete it there. You basically have two chances per week per toon, so the drop rate is tuned up high. But some people don‚Äôt know those two conditions: all four forges unlocked, powerful frame ready to forge.
---
It's also everytime I'm low on health some little asshole thrall or whatever melees me killing a SECOND after I place the rift
---
Those load times make me cry
---
Oh nah I‚Äôm a hunter main all the way
---
Sick
---
BEGONE THOT!!
---
Love you 3000
---
Aren‚Äôt forge unlocks on an account basis now? I swear they changed that in opulence
---
*Chomp*
---
Well the invader in gambit has wall hacks, and an insane over shield.
---
*remembers oem exists*
---
Nevermind.
---
I don't get it
---
Basically everything
---
THATS SCIENTIFICLY IMPOSSIBLE!!üëâ
---
Let's do this!
---
60fps
---
I don‚Äôt think so. I only have Izinami it on my Hunter. That one is a pain to unlock, never mind the ridiculous length of the Izinagi‚Äôs Burden quest. I did it, but it required research, by damn.
---
I‚Äôm just imagining our guardian relentlessly choking Uldren to death and once he stops breathing Pulled Pork just comes out and rezes him.
---
I thought it said foreskin campaign
---
Chaos Reach, Arc Empowered, Geomag... enough said
---
Lol asks to be nicer but replies to comment with, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask and I don‚Äôt care‚Äù. Nice job OP setting the example perfectly xD /s. Practice what you preach bud
---
&gt;t
---
i just want the sparrow  :(
---
Condolences to your guardian‚Äôs family and friends. Too soon were you taken from this world.
---
Ok I hope no guardians suddenly become attracted to a hive wizard like plz no
---
technically he‚Äôs correct
---
Nevermind that you can more or less engage from ambush unless they're actively looking for you.
---
True lol
---
Inb4 they forget to make Will of the Thousands and Strange Terrain the Nightfalls that week.
---
That‚Äôs like saying ROI is just recycled y1 cosmodrome content cause they share a space (and that dlc was one of the best ever)
---
She looking kinda thicc ngl
---
I‚Äôm sorry but with ignorance like that I had to downvote lol.
---
he's got No Time to Explain
---
But without a lot of the hassle of SMGs. I think the most kills I have in any Masterwork weapon is my Vestian Dynasty because I masterworked it early (because fixed perks) and because with a range MW and a Minor spec it makes small enemies vanish (dragonfly) and soften bigger ones in the process for Kill clip follow-ups. 
---
I have better rolls but the Dynasty is one of my favorites for arc burns.
---
The knight is the obstacles between me and my goals in life and that's just how I'm living at the moment
---
yeah but it reminded me of Kanade
---
My controllers get this hitch in the left stick that stops my sprints at inopportune times. Usually while trying a shoulder charge ability.
---
I love it.
---
This me confirming I did in fact enjoy myself
---
It‚Äôs gonna flop unless pvp is completely overhauled; you can only kill so many taken
---
Demolitionist on primaries aren't really worth it IMO, get a fusion rifle or shotgun with it and you'll utilize the perk better
---
But it adds real risk. Dying in a darkness zone is slightly more inconvenient than dying normally.
---
were you playing Gambit Prime?
---
orbs don‚Äôt drop in Competitive Crucible or Gambit Prime
---
I got 112 kills in 3 rounds of normal Gambit with an Oxygen SR3 and a Phoenix well and does that mean that Oxygen is good? No the fuck it doesn't, it's easy to get kills with any gun, doesn't change the fact the guns can be ass
---
And DPS on primaries doesn't matter bruh, it's the damage per shot, no one cares about DPS when killing a thrall, and using them on anything higher then a red bar is stupid unless its outbreak or a procced tarabah/recluse (and pre nerf Lunas/NF rip my babies), specials  and heavies are used for that
---
SMGs, sidearms and ARs may or may not have higher dps then other primaries but tell me how many people are running them compared to pulse rifles and Handcannons, and don't use recluse as an excuse for SMGs because that thing is only good cause of master of arms, that is getting devastetd next season
---
thanks
---
I was playing regular too, but wasn‚Äôt getting any orbs there either.
---
Only if they bring back Sunsinger and self rez. 
---
^***PRAISE THE SUN***^
---
Why does playing pc matter?
---
I don't know. I hope not, doesn't seem moral
---
Yes.
---
Word ty
---
Because many of us never played D1
---
Fair enough I guess, but a lot of the hardcore destiny fans went to pc. So saying you‚Äôre pc doesn‚Äôt really mean much.
---
*Joins for group hug*
---
Might be cool to add the bullet flying through the air
---
Thought the EP would be a piece of cake. Then I say the 7...
---
Post your specs. There is an article by Nvidia on the Nvidia site that shows in very good detail what each option costs in terms of fps. Even I'd your card is amd it should still apply. Good luck.
---
What you see is what she sees
---
Helmet xenosilver (optimacy)

Arms frumious blue (optimacy)

Chest omolon meteor gloss (solstice)

Legs frumious blue (solctice)

---
Sorry brand new to Reddit haha and couldn't figure this out before.
---
Holy shit I just laughed so hard at this, thank you
---
Taniks still needs a house
---
Idk why...but it kinda reminds me of Vanitas from Kingdom Hearts. Like, with his helmet on obviously. Either way I dig it
---
Thanks man, all jokes aside I'm so happy that this little doodle I drew has given some people something to feel good about!
---
Should have more upvotes IMO! Creativity +20 - well done, looks awesome! ü§òüèª
---
Complete the lost sector on Nessus that‚Äôs near the cistern and it should prompt.
---
They drop from both nightfall (7 each time) or heroic adventures on Mars--the purple ones you pickup from Ana (2 each time).
---
However, I was only able to do the Mars heroic once per day.  Nightfall is the way to go.
---
Even if there are similar areas on the moon, it will be nostalgic for me to return to it in D2, I haven‚Äôt been there in years!
---
So you'd lose you're character, have to level them up again, require all armour rolls, weapons rolls, etc... And potentially because someone else messed up? Seems a little strong!
---
Same here, love that gun
---
In the infinite forest, time itself is in flux.
---
WARM JEBUS!
---
I feel ya, I used to shoot before it was hype
---
Something to keep in mind, when going from a new IP to a sequel of it there's a lot of learning and changing and relearning to do. Cosmetics are going to be huge going forward but we will get some good looking stuff without it (in reference to people talking about wanting some D1 armor too), but something to consider is that Bungie has finally fallen into a "battle rhythm" of sorts and has done good so far with Forsaken.
---
I think it'll be just fine. :)
---
If you enter you Inventory, at the top you will see 'Collections'.
---
Go there, select 'Weapons', then 'Hand Cannons.'
---
In the 'Hand Cannons' section, you will be able to reclaim Rose.
---
Thank you. Will I be deducted what I got for disasembling it or its a free pass for every gear?
---
De definitely made a sort of typo and ment 1 million
---
I swear Hunters and Titans that invade have half a brain cell between them.
---
wot
---
Eh, that's fair.
---
To reclaim a Legendary weapon, it will require (I think) 3-5 Gunsmith Materials, 3-5 Legendary Shards, and some Glimmer.
---
It costs slightly more than what you get for disassembling it.
---
The boys is literally the best
---
Yea, thanks. Now to figure out the mouse input delay..
---
Oh thats fine, considering ill be able to finish the quest. Thank you for detailed info
---
There is one particular piece tat needed Arc Guardian Kills, so weapons or abilities, but guardians in the specific. Crucible or Gambit, both works.
---
The video is clean, nice work! Also, what mix is this, haven't heard it before?
---
I guess they dig deep and build high, so it might be for awkward to reach places - perhaps demo work where you don't want to be underneath what you're shooting?
---
It's going to be interesting to see what's on the Moon as this time the Vex are going to place they know is a stronghold of the Hive, so surely they'd take an assault crew along with construction ones?
---
Nah there's a data limit they would have all the content they have right now
---
Thanks for your reply my dude. I'm happy to hear the game is still going strong. That was a bit of a worry point for me. Thanks again!
---
I mean it wasn‚Äôt. This years Armor is better I mean more it was easier
---
I actually the armor looks better without the light effects
---
Thanks for your input. I feared it would be too late to properly experience the game. But I am happy to hear people are still getting into it.
---
It depends, if you can get the first invade off and killing enough mote holders denying their invasion, it can basically decide a whole game (short of a miracle comeback) in regular gambit.
---
Enjoy my friend :)
---
As a newbie: How do I recognize which roles people run?
---
Thanks for your input friend. I'm not new to the grind, I've known my fair share of it so it's not what I was worried after. I just feared empty hubs, bored veterans and generally a dying game. I am very happy to see that isn't the case at all. Thanks again!
---
Haha I‚Äôm praying on it my brother
---
F for a fellow Titan
---
I think this years armor is worth the grind because it looks cool.
---
I think we‚Äôre all a little bit tired man.
---
Yea. I haven‚Äôt played in 6 months so when I logged on I guess it was really intimidating and confusing since it‚Äôs been ages and I just chose not to do it
---
I've done 60 in one week. Now I'm dredgen and the drifter wont see me ever again. I'm done!
---
Maybe someone gifted it to you.
---
your overall kd is .87. Yeah, keep using tigerspite and low and telling people sniping is easy lol
---
Yes, Shadowkeep will have it's own annual pass. They will be called season pass, and you will be able to purchase them separate.
---
Who does Escalation anymore though? Let alone more than NFs! Although, will that count as x9 for a 9 player Escalation takedown?
---
Ah alright, thanks for the response :)
---
It's possible, but i have no recollection of that.  
---
So is it safe to say that I own the game? Would it typically say 'Buy Now'?
---
Will forsaken annual pass still be purchasable after shadowkeep releases?
---
Plus we all know zavala wouldn‚Äôt do jack shit
---
Green: Reaper: Kills everything
---
Yellow: Sentry: Protects the bank and handles Invaders
---
White: Collector: Collects notes
---
Red: Invader: Invades
---
Seems that way. 
---
The base game goes free to play October 1st anyway.
---
Doubt bungie will change the way they do things but you may be able to get what you want out of an xbox elite controller with all of its customizable settings.
---
But the Seed is, regardless. You just need to loot the Court chest to get it.
---
lets hope together
---
I did 2 decided doing a third was gonna break my brain lol 200 mini boss kills was a bit much
---
Pretty much.  The ones I've seen usually move like 10 ft left, 10 ft right, jump once, shoot once, and maybe a forward/backward if they're getting fancy.
---
Supers last longer with the matching empowerment. GG lasts for ages, Spectral Blades becomes a Nightmare!
---
I think it is a major part of destiny's identity, and without it destiny would lose much of its player base and online viewership. Remember when Trials of Osiris was popular in D1, many thousands of people watched it every weekend. I think destiny is great with both sides, because sometimes people want to go do a raid and use the gear they got to blast off the head of a fellow guardian. I don't understand the logic of statements like this because if it were an inverse the same could still be applied.
---
Breakneck4life
---
Given the wording they used (\*\*Defeat 175 thousand Wave 7 Escalation protocol bosses\*\*) I think that a 9 person Level 7 EP Boss kill counts as one instance of the boss dying.
---
Yes I believe so
---
Just to be clear, full access to Gambit does not mean I will be able to get the gambit pinnacle weapons since they are tied to the annual pass?
---
How did I know what song this had before I turned sound on
---
R/mildlyinfuriating
---
Destiny 2 on PC, use a DS4 controlled with DS4 windows software and you'll have now options than you can shake a stick at...
---
But like also why would you need TLW if you don‚Äôt play pvp
---
Probably chaperone
---
Warlock was definitely the worst for me, but I‚Äôm glad to have that done.
---
feel like this belongs on r/DestinyFashion
---
What are you talking about? There is no 100 crucible match requirement on any of the gear.
---
Likely the 4th time we'll kill him.
---
That's true, but not everyone uses a full clip, sometimes it's nice to be able to get a couple kills and reload quickly, besides, it isn't always the best choice to throw a grenade the second you get it back, for pve or pvp
---
Happy cake day
---
Lol, what is it with pvp sweats and that wing theorem gear - like, are there any perks that I'm not aware of, or is just that that's all they have to wear because they never set foot outside the crucible???
---
I actually did izanagi's burden like that yesterday.
---
Honestly it doesn't matter much. You won't get the new classes until you do forsaken stuff( you get one class of your choice in campaign and unlock the other 2 in the dreaming city/endgame)
---
If you know you are going to get forsaken anyways you might as well buy it now for convenience. 
---
If you are on PC, you have until September 3 to buy forsaken on battle.net, otherwise you will have to wait until  shadow keep to buy and play it. I am not sure if console is affected.
---
A few things to note for your play through:
---
For curse of Osiris and warmind, I suggest just completing the campaigns and adventures and completing their endgame activities after shadowkeep launches. 
---
Buy fireteams medallions from the bottom tab in eververse to boost your xp for levelling up.
---
Complete as many bounties as you can while leveling up and doing campaigns, etc Turning in those bounties give you more xp.
---
Once you reach lv 50, you need to go to the tower in the new section "annex" and visit the robot vendor there. He will give you a quest which when completed will instantly give you 690 power gear, which will bypass a great deal of the power level climb. If you like having a little bit of challenge, wait until you finish forsaken and dreaming city content before you complete the bounty.
---
Do not infuse weapons yet. For most activities period in the game it will not matter much. Save your cores.
---
Pick up bounties from the gunsmith and complete them daily. This will help you build a inventory of enhancement cores and mod components for shadow keep.
---
Pick up the weapon quests from shaxx and the drifter(gambit vendor). These weapons are called pinnacle weapons and are unique and powerful legendary weapons.(you don't need to focus on completing them, just have them so while you are doing other stuff you might automatically knock out some of the parts and reduce the grind later.
---
Dismantle any unused ships, sparrows, ghost shells, and shades that you are not using. They will give you bright dust and you can retrieve them later any time in shadowkeep, as well as easily farm them for good rolls.
---
Unlock all of the black armory forges so you can farm for the weapons/rolls you want later.
---
Complete at least tier 2 reckoning so you are familiar with how it runs if you need to do it later.
---
Finally complete any and all requirements for the title MMIX at the bottom of the triumphs tab. That is a title only available until the 17th.
---
Finally if you want it at all, you need to start working on the solstice of heroes armor NOW. You only have until Tuesday to earn a legendary set, and it will take a fair bit of time. It is a requirement for the MMIX Title if you are interested in it.(all other titles are available any time FYI)
---
Who's the master in this situation?
---
here before trending
---
So I‚Äôm a gambit sweat, when I actually try you‚Äôre gonna be in for a fight and better bring you A-Game.
---
Lately, I‚Äôm working on my Reckoner seal after putting it off for a while. So I‚Äôve been trying to get my massacre medal and have been intentionally causing games to last longer so I can try and get two supers for ad waves a game. This includes holding onto too many motes and getting myself killed, or just not depositing. Essentially handicapping my team(sorry guys).
---
I‚Äôm on a 8 game win streak right now. And I‚Äôm not even trying lol.
---
God, did you drink it?  Do those things expire?  lol
---
Perfect parking space
---
Same, I decided I'd rather do some activities that I wanted and had fun in instead of doing some tedious grind of activities that I only get frustration from. Who needs a glowing armor anyway when you have a minigun that lights your way with muzzle flashes and orbs of light from fallen enemies.
---
Yeah, I agree, but I think what was meant to be just a inconvenience keep killing us, like on the video, boss stomps and phalanxes that kill us by hitting the wall
---
Until Bungie resurrects him for some contrived reason in the next DLC.
---
[deleted]
---
I think it was when you started Shiites the sidearm with out aiming in
---
Shit, forgot to put that. Top tree storm
---
BOTTOM TREE ARCSTRIDER DODGE FTW!
---
They dont do pve, so no access to enhanced perks?
---
Wait, "epic" needs an extra adjective now?
---
Couple of things I‚Äôve noticed as a PS4 player on PC. Keep in mind I have base Destiny 2. No expansions at all. 
---
1: The game does not realize I‚Äôm level 50. This makes it so I can‚Äôt pick up any Gambit bounties. 
---
2: All loot is dropping at 380. Even pinnacle weapons. I just unlocked Hush, my character is 750, it dropped at 380. Weapons purchasable from NPC‚Äôs are 340. 
---
3: All gear except PS4 exclusive is accessible. This is wonderful!
---
4: Solstice can be completed fully! Great news for those of us who started on PS4 and will finish on PC with or without DLC. 
---
I don‚Äôt know if 1 and 2 are bugs or are due to me not owning the DLC, but the game should recognize my character level/light and work accordingly.
---
I haven't drunken it yet lmao. As for expiration, there's a date on the bottom, but it's really smoothed together and hard to read. Considering it came out round this time last year for promotion, probably not safe.
---
Probably
---
I've been told, on multiple occasions, that I look like Dewight from the Office.
---
I think maybe the background needs some more color! (Different shades)  but as a hunter I approve
---
Y‚Äôall mind if I M A L F E A S A N C E ?
---
I want something reminiscent of a snake, a Vex snake that coils and twists around as it tries to attack you.
---
Its 1 million logins daily atm
---
And it increases every friday by one
---
Haha thanks Kdawg 
---
Also wow 1k upvotes! Mom I made it!
---
No
---
'God rolls' from the wing theorem gear? I mean, it can't drop with additional perks or anything. Maybe it's a form of sweat signalling - I'm so good I don't need 'enhancements'.
---
dYinG chidReN!
---
Because Iif you knew what you were talking about youd be able to recognize making changes isnt as simple as flipping a switch...  like the meme shows. Biss says "do this." Dev says "that's literally impossible given our code structure and for us to apply it would mean redeveloping the game and server downtime." Boss says "then let's slowly implement these changes over updates and hot fixes so we dont have to reinvent the wheel." Its not that they dont have managers, it's that you're applying logic from manual labor to the business of providing services. They aren't the same.
---
And link me all you want to "hundreds" of articles by Kotaku and Forbes. They're both unscrupulous and, IMO, untrustworthy sources. They've demonstrated plenty of times that they're out for sensationalism. So please spare me links to the TMZs of gaming. But let's say you can produce "hundreds" of reputable news sources with demonstrable integrity... those are OpEd articles at best.  Theres no reason anyone should conflate their opinions with anything remotely resembling a fact about anyone at Bungie.  Yourself included. 
---
In reality you dont actually know anything you're claiming. You're just an angry adolescent.
---
Finish Dreaming City and make a break for the Menagerie and lots of Strikes. Quite often Vuvuzela and other vendors will drop items in the high 600-low 700s. The Menagerie can be forced to drop 750* items and then just infuse anything you like.
---
Ow, you hurt my feeling
---
Big sad I would have helped you if you were on PC
---
I'd rather hawthorn le be replaced by him lmao she just says the same thing over, and over
---
Th-thanks Guardian! *wipes tear from top eye*
---
7 more to go... Please god just let them go quick. There's something about being made to do them and not doing it because I want to that makes it that much worse.
---
I recommend running exodus crash with momentum and match game the rest is really up to you but make sure you have at least a 5x multiplier
---
For real!
---
Its best for pvp with tranversite
---
You should probably work towards the gear for the role that fits you best in gambit prime. If you don‚Äôt have massive DPS weapons like shotguns and snipers ready you shouldn‚Äôt be a sentry.
---
I would just keep the can, that looks sick
---
Holy Zavala....
---
Check the bungie forums (terminal illness included)
---
So this is what my blueberries have been doing while i do literally everything
---
It‚Äôs the vault of glass
---
Use a fireteam medallion and a ghost shell with guiding light.
---
Do an activity on repeat for exp. Personally I think heroic public events on EDZ/Nessus are fastest.
---
You get it :p LETS FUCKIN GOO!!!
---
Just as a word of advice, next time melee then, and you might live üòâ
---
There were three dough, I‚Äôm not sure you wouldn‚Äôt end up mashed potatoes style dough...
---
what does that have to do with it?
---
Not all heroes wear capes.
---
Looks incredible! How did you make this? Isn‚Äôt it called the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù tool in photoshop or something?
---
So when do I have to finish my suit by? I tried looking it up but my search skills are failing me.
---
Came here thinking this, just a BS excuse to get the checkpoint.
---
You should add all three subclasses

Which I personally think is silly. My friend and I use the Sentry set and Reaper set respectively. Me, a Titan, culling the hordes of enemies. Him, a Hunter, dealing with Blockers and killing the Invader almost as soon as they spawn.
---
Not sure if talking about the drink or cayde
---
I was okay with my DLC not transferring, but the fact that any progress I make on PC will essentially be pointless unless I have something to use to infuse (which I can only get on my PS4 due to no DLC), and the mats to infuse.
---
r/phalanxed
---
Half expecting Atheon to spawn in
---
Extra style points when your sitting on your sparrow and it happens. Good times in 3rd person.
---
Smh Look at me I‚Äôm posh trash that acts like a stick up and begs for free things imo roflmafo brb gtg gtfo lol XD lol blueberrys
---
Sorry mate, I'm really not trying to be dense here.  But it says, " Your melee recharges faster while you are invisible. "  So I've never typically thought of it as such.  I used it a lot with Rat King and bottom tree Gunslinger.
---
Did anyone actually win the Destiny 2 Slingshot Roadster?
---
No worries. I just recently found out about this so I thought it was cool.
---
In case this is a serious question: *read the store description.* See how it says "you will receive a code for a free download" of this soundtrack. You can't actually buy it, the listed price is a joke. 
---
Note that a lot of people seem to not get the email automatically, many of us have to go to the Bungie Rewards page conveniently linked there *in the description* and manually request it to be sent.
---
People are just lazy.
---
That's a new one to me, what kind of delay?
---
You‚Äôre correct. Meant to put Was* once I got it I never took it off.
---
Same here I instantly thought of VOG
---
Bro I was warned that I couldn‚Äôt access my other account until cross save was disabled. Mabey people should read
---
quit
---
Nope. üëç
---
But is this better than say, enhanced hc targeting and enhanced shotgun dexterity, or enhanced grenade launcher loader and enhanced scout rifle targeting? All of these require you to set foot outside the crucible of course...
---
It's really sick, but 6 choas reachs still only equals about 1 fists of havoc in amount of kills
---
Look at this hunter taking out a Primeval by himself by what... 
---
#  PUNCHING IT
---
absolute madlad. Shaxx would be proud.
---
Screw shotgun dexterity, give me traction. *cries in console*
---
I'm not certain this is public knowledge, but if you charge them and melee as they boop you it will nullify the architects power.
---
Thank you so much! :D
---
Wow buddy, I'd kms, but I think you want to do it for me!
---
And I am the reason the community has such a negative light. 
---
From this silly wall of wtf, I've been able to discern that you're a terrible person yourself apparently! XD 
---
Oh my, did that hurt? Am I gonna get another wall of text? 
---
GTFO. Lol
---
For real though, what is YOUR issue? If a friend had told you you wasted money when you could have gotten something free it would be considered playful while still condescending right? Because you like your friend? 
---
Well, now you know why I am still in a good mood and responding/ having fun with this. To me, I'm just being friendly and talking shit back. If you can't handle that, or dish it yourself then YOU definitely wouldn't fit in the military. XD you probably won't even have offline friend's irl. 
---
So touchy. Especially you. Why are you trying to trash my service record? Because you think it was a flex? You asked and I gave you a legitimate answer. Like wtf did you expect? Me to say sorry after you said I was the issue with the community? ROFL Fuck off kid
---
I don't give a shit dude. I wasn't warned, many other people weren't warned. Go to the bungie forums and find out the lack of care from bungo for an issue they caused. I'm finding it here too.
---
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. 
---
In other words, decide for yourself what you like
---
No prob. üòÅ
---
Stupidly broken. No one should be able to output that much damage. Makes any pve activity a joke
---
Worked at a convenience store for 10 years, can confirm those things go bad after 2 years MAX. After the the first year their flavor dies, but it's still edible...but the usual dates on the cans are around 2 years.
---
People here clearly don‚Äôt understand the issue 
---
You can‚Äôt DISABLE cross save if you purchased silver in the last 90 days 
---
They NEVER SAID THAT - it was added AFTER PEOPLE MADE THEM AWARE OF THE ISSUE 
---
It always was 90 days to ACTIVATE if - and you can deactivate it at any time 
---
They CHANGED THAT
---
Don't understand why he is downvoted, He is correct. You can Melee as they launch you and it it breaks the fly away. Same thing with stomp bosses.
---
Mabey you just ignored it, they plastered it right in the confirmation text for cross save read before you hit accept
---
Finish the campaign (if you have forsaken) and you get 690 blues which you can infuse into whatever
---
If I were you, I'd worry about completing the campaigns, and then just working on gear and quests. When Shadowkeep launches Oct 1 all of your gear will boost to 750 to put you on a level playing field with everyone else, and I assume your level will jump to 50 so that you'll be able to equip said gear.
---
Go away dude. You're bootlicking the shit out of bungie by coming up with all these excuses as to why it's my fault. No, it's bungies fault. They need to fix this
---
Do you stomp in crucible? Do you win the average game? The people you beat with a kd of 0.8 - 0.5 are the people who consider it a big deal. You obv think it's stupid and you hate seeing it but people can really have a hard time in pvp and to them it is a big deal. It's the most 'meta' gun in the game and they probably had a horrible time trying to get it and spent days of their life not having fun and feeling like crap just to finally have it. Don't begrudge others their victories just because it's easy by your perspective. Is it annoying? Yeah but try to have some empathy
---
I know which two I like. But i can‚Äôt choose between them.  The arc and the solar. I just wanted to see what the popular choice was and get a second opinion before my purchase.

Which do you use more?
---
Well f you too
---
What? No.
---
Where was enhanced mentioned anywhere? This whole thread revolves around the stereotypical PvP sweat has his best armor perks on wing theorem since they typically play only PVP with very little PVE. 
---
My comment was about the other person‚Äôs statement of handcannon targeting (amongst other perks) is all you need. HC targeting gives same stat boost as precision targeting, but is limited to only HCs. Enhanced perks are possible in this topic since we‚Äôre talking about sweats who never leave crucible.
---
i think you just combined like 4 different users posts thinking they were all me.... lol
---
I have a gaming PC but all my friends are on PS4 so I'm not switching unless we get cross-play, which I'm not sure will ever happen.
---
Solar lol.
---
NPC Loadout
---
People do realize it's a *community* event, right?  
---
Like, they're not expecting a fireteam of 3 to complete those challenges.
---
I hate when they stomp/slam/blast you and you go flying off the map but it's not a far stomp, it's the one where you're just like 6 inches away from landing on the edge but can't grab it.
---
6 inches is 15.24 cm
---
Do the stuff that grants powerful gear, go to your pursuits tab to hunt for weapons that may give you an advantage, do exotic quests, maybe a raid when you of adequate light level. There‚Äôs a lot to do before Shadowkeep.
---
It‚Äôs really not that great, but it‚Äôs pretty cool to have, I feel like it has a slightly higher drop rate than some other ones like anarchy
---
I feel like I've been identified. And I don't like it.
---
One Two is the whole point of this video lol.
---
You forgot OEM striker Titan
---
Well "on PC" is your answer.
---
It gets better every loop. I can't stop laughing.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
This happened to me last night. A walker slammed me right off the edge.
---
No, it wasn't a serious question, I'm not going to say r/woooosh because you obviously understand that this is not serious.  
---
But to the guy that down-voted me and up-voted this comment, you did get wooooshed.
---
Honestly? I feel sorry for him. Now he has no reason to replay that amazing content, unless for some weird untold illogical reason he wants to farm some weapons/armor he ain't gonna use bar a couple
---
is that some time of peasant day mode joke? Or am I just too much of a Night mode chad to understand that?
---
My apologies if this seems obvious, but 2 things I have seen are 1 not wearing the helmet when doing the strikes, or not entering strikes from the strike playlist and just choosing a strike from a planet.
---
Mine has a range masterwork, Full choke/rifled barrel, acurized rounds, slide shot, grave robber. I have to admit I consider it my child. No snapshot, but I put a sprint grip mod on it. I think the grave robber perk works well with it, because if the shotgun doesn't finish them off I'm going to melee them anyway.
---
Yeah I got told by the opposite team to kill myself for using Le Monarque in comp.  
---
Why does it matter what anyone is using for a loadout?  What is an acceptable loadout that you'll be ok with them using?  And people that complain about what you use in quickplay... why would you not use Not Forgotten if you had it?  Are you just supposed to run around with garbage because you're doing too well?

---
Yup got that,,, but the game doesn‚Äôt count the orbs I pick up in strikes, last piece on last character ,,,super frustrating,,,been grinding my ass off
---
People like him make me wanna just quit the game
---
I honestly didn't even realize there was one until I searched.
---
This is P E A K S U P E R U S A G E
---
Not doing either of those,,, doing it right but not getting the credit
---
Sorry, I wasn't clear enough, I have both a gaming PC and a PS4. I play this game on PS4, though, so all my friends are on PS4 and if there was cross-play I'd switch to PC.
---
That or clouds at sea. Ish.  Kinda.  Nevermind lol
---
I'm not sure what you're trying to say in relation to my post. I mean, I want to be able to use all the armor I've earned??? And iron banner stuff is y2 so you know, some of the nice Titan arms, hunter cloaks and warlock robes we earned this past year won't matter
---
What the hell
---
If you‚Äôre ever stuck and you‚Äôre not level 50 yet, just check the pursuits tab to see a mission or the Milestones to see quest steps!
---
It‚Äôll use vanishing step before I can get to it
---
1) you keep missing the period button there buddy
---
2) Are you matching the daily elemental bonus with your subclass during strikes? Note: It's not the strike playlist burn that they're talking about, its the Solstice element
---
Sometimes I do cool things
---
I inspect fireteam, I see nova lock, I put on tractor, I happy.
---
What shaders are they using?
---
I really don‚Äôt fancy facing pc players in the crucible there‚Äôs enough bullshittery that goes on.
---
No absolutely not menagerie is god tier menagerie good lost sector bad ur bad kys
---
Is your subclass the same element as the current solstice element?
---
That‚Äôs pretty dirty tbh. Add the health regen on kill via catalyst on top.
---
Louis&gt;Calus
---
wait, is Ophidian Aspect good in Crucible? It always just sounded like it‚Äôd be underwhelming.
---
*BOOSTO-FIYAH!!...FURU POWAH!!
---
Yeah man. The synergy is insane
---
How do I access that?
---
body shot wow so trash
---
Noice
---
Translation please?
---
If I was trying to hit period I would have ,,,,, but thanks for that,,,, and I have matched both burns in an effort to finish this. I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone else is having this issue
---
It happens to us all every once in a while. I've definitely died throwing blade barrage into a wall before.
---
I imagine they would have separate queues like GTA does.
---
Completionism? Idk lol. I pvp, not terribly much, but I do. I'm pretty close to getting Redrix's Broadsword. I've never really used LW after I got it just because I wasn't that great at pvp when I got it. 
---
I might dig in and learn how to use it more effectively later on.
---
Fashion sense from u/igotvocals
---
That must be the opposite of what people‚Äôs call ‚Äúwoke‚Äù
---
I wasn‚Äôt quoting you ver batim I was summarizing your arguments to point out how illogical and defensive you‚Äôre being. Yes, you obviously need the right runes to roll DRB. That‚Äôs implied by the way menagerie functions. Don‚Äôt fucking run menagerie to chase an item you don‚Äôt have the runes for, obviously. You‚Äôre making these points to justify the position that lost sectors are a less tedious way to farm DRB than menagerie AFTER you conceded that the only reason you mentioned lost sectors was because you forgot that you could obtain it through the menagerie. That‚Äôs fucking silly. You don‚Äôt need to make the point that you need the right runes. Or that sometimes groups are bad. Those are both things that are obviously true. Why do you reiterate that you only said lost sectors because you forgot about menagerie and then continue defending the position that you find lost sectors less tedious? It doesn‚Äôt make sense. I get the feeling that you aren‚Äôt actually absorbing the words that people are writing to you, and will continue to reflexively argue against anything that comes up.
---
Hey! You fight dirty! I like ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-IMPACT
---
Define ‚Äúreasonable ‚Äú
---
I want it for the sole purpose of having every exotic. This'll complete the collection for me. I've grown to like smgs so I'd probably use it.
---
Its the emoji 
---
Edit: and maybe the tone
---
Lmao
---
You bet cha
---
Y'know that the first post when you google "TWAB" is "This week at Bungie" right? Shouldn't be too hard to just google an acronym to find out what it means
---
No no, a sword jotunn. Swotunn.
---
What's your exact budget? I can help you make up a build starting at 400+tax that could handle destiny at 1080p &gt;60fps, but a bit more could go a long way.
---
If you want, I'd be willing to do a discord call/ text chat and discuss selection with you so you can be informed about what everything is.
---
Ah yeah, cause you can totally use this in crucible as consistently as a shoulder charge
---
I do this everytime I spawn my Sparrow in the air. Land it maybe 50% if the time? You would think I would learn not to hold forward at this point.
---
Lol hunters are, still just love the play of titans
---
You obliterated them!  I love it!!!
---
If you're in America you will have better luck getting cheaper parts  https://www.reddit.com/r/PCMasterRace/wiki/builds#wiki_starter
---
The ability regen buff is nothing to sneeze at! I like it for pvp bc it highlights invisible players, too.
---
Xur is on a roll, suddenly starting to sell annual pass exotics these past 2 weeks instead of the usual useless stuff. 
---
Peregrine grieves next week plz
---
If you're tech/build saavy you can usually find some used office computers (my University auctions them off for like $40 all the time) with relatively strong CPUs and sometimes an SSD. These can be cheap to convert by adding a GPU. But if you're more of a beginner PC builder then I might suggest building from scratch. Also Google Logical Increments website, they have build suggestions for different games at each price range
---
Go ahead, get on your Titan with Insurmountable Skullfort, see if you can win a match! See how easy it is!
---
Then begin to realise how poor our hit-detection is and how often the lunge doesn't even work. Or how quickly and swiftly you're countered by Erentils and any Shotgun, or how fast you're 3-tapped out by a HC, destroyed by a Last Word.
---
It's so easy dude, go ahead. Try it.
---
This is what I run when I play my Titan. I love it because  it makes that super put out a lot of damage with only a little bit of prep.
---
When you use the button to open the director where all the planets are, for pursuits just press L1 go move over one tab. For the milestones you‚Äôll press L2 to slide over the milestones!
---
Well sure, but so will a $550 PC in a couple years
---
So what‚Äôs the name of it?
---
Possibly, you might want to clear your search data to double check that's not just because you and I search for Bungie and Destiny stuff.
---
Regardless, it would be nice if we had it right here.
---
I'm enjoying immersing myself in community stuff and suddenly I come across an acronym people are using. 
---
It's also good, common practice pretty much everywhere to define an acronym either before its repeated use OR in some clear easily accessible place. That is, until the thing is industry or field accepted.
---
Anyways, I think it should be in the sidebar because I'm not the only one who was confused for a while.
---
THANK YOU!
---
Veteran Guardian Returning
---
Your system(s): PS4
---
Your Gamertag: KronoEX Your country/time zone:Canada, EST
---
When do you usually play (include times and time zone): Usually in the evening and on weekends
---
Tell us a bit about yourself (ex: experience in Destiny, how many characters, Light Levels, anything else): I Played Destiny 1 from launch. Never stopped. Our core raid team cleared content as it was released. Hard mode clears on the same day. Platinum Trophy
---
Same thing for Destiny 2. My clan cleared content as it came up. We all lost interest just after Curse of Osiris. I am just getting back into the swing of things now.
---
Also have gone flawless in Trials of Osiris on D1 and D2. Really good in Iron Banner as well.
---
What are you looking for in a clan (for example: PvE, PvP, any special criteria): I'm trying to clear content I missed as well as gearing up for Shadowkeep. Looking to collect anything and everything in terms of exotics and weapons. Looking for some chill people to have fun and clear content with.
---
Thanks for taking the time to read this!
---
Xur, what wrong with you? Someone farm infinite forest for Arbalest...
---
Then you try and win a match with just liar's and any subclass. You'll be greeted with just as many shoulder charges, shotguns, fusions and smgs. You'll find you will only get punched when you're low on health, cause the enemy has eyes and knows if you survive a punch they are dead. They're kinda nowhere near the same thing.
---
You must be uncultured to not use dark mode. It is meant to be white text.
---
Was it easy to locate?
---
Ophidian aspect or something like that
---
There are three playlist type game modes under earth in the director the green one is gambit click that one then in the gambit screen click the one on the left then play until you get bygones
---
I just wanna comment and say that sucks big, but really I just want to tell you that my name in game is IronHyde84x. It's nice to see another autobot
---
One probable cause is that you have the game stored on a slow storage device.
---
I've got mine on an SSD, but I've got a friend with a faster one, and he always spawns first.
---
I also got 1K first try. Pissed the hell outta my friends who did the raid like 50 times.
---
How did you find my profile.
---
Except this is in fact highly viable. This combo is simple to pull off and is easily the highest dps combo in the game. Even without arc empowerment, you can easily kill a primeval in under 15 seconds with NO stacks at all. This combo is seriously that ridiculous.
---
I never said Risk Runner was bad I just said fuck it. I‚Äôd rather have Zhalo because it was the first ever exotic I got so it has sentimental value to me.
---
how long does that take?
---
What kind of arm gear do you have that has the blade?
---
Then let's kill him properly this time.
---
Last year was the last time i played D2, i still wanted to sparrow fly.
---
TIL my Bungie Heart emblem I got for donating to charity means I‚Äôm a sweat... worth.
---
Sorry, didn‚Äôt realize tone doesn‚Äôt exist for some people. The word choice contributes to how people will read it. Some will read it and see it as condescending or some will read it and think nothing at all.
---
I'm pumped about this gun being offered but I'm getting tired of getting my exotics from this guy. I can't get anything to drop for the life of me
---
Sorry for replying late didn't get notified, its in the underground lost sector, youll need to get in it then go in the cracks in the wall and pull out your sword
---
The War Rig for Titans pairs nicely with SB.
---
Way she goes lol
---
Thats my boy.
---
If you're lucky, one match. If not, lots of matches.
---
When I hover the playlist it says I have 4000 points, how many do you need to get the gun?
---
Arbalest and ashen wake are underrated. CROWN OF TEMPESTS!!! I have been waiting for this for so long. I got the ornament for it last week and I've always wanted it. Very good exotic. 
---
You know what? No dupes for me this week which is good. But i got the two tailed fox from my fated engram. I was only joking with my brother the other day that I'm going to get a two tailed fox from xur knowing my luck even though you get it for free with shadowkeep. When it popped up on the side of my screen i was both angry and in stitches at the same time. I've got nothing against the weapon but... you get it for free with shadowkeep...
---
Oh well, free exotic shard to masterwork a armour 2.0 piece with i guess.
---
Its random, try going for your challenges and hope to get one, if you dont it drops randomly from match completions(I think) and infamy rankups
---
have you checked your drivers? also turn shawdow quality down. i dod have to bump that down a little
---
It sucks that most lfg posts are "kwtd &amp; have clears, will check" and that's before have xyz weapons with this perk combo... I understand that some weapons are simply better for dps cough prospector/riven cough.
---
I have 3 raid clears total in d2 versus 176 in d1. Miss guiding ppl through raids
---
A comment made by a random that joined us as we had 3 new guys in last wish "this is an oddly capable raid team" we wiped a lot but never to the same mistake twice.
---
Have things explained took a bit like the plates puzzle (had my brightness to high to see the tic tac toe grid) but once it was explained it just clicked.
---
Still wary of the queen's walk as I was first or second each time so don't know the whole route.
---
There‚Äôs no guaranteed way to get the gun the points won‚Äôt get you the gun you just play and hope for the best
---
yeah def but until i get my hunter 750 and curated emperors curtosey imma stick with my mtt anarchy titan lol
---
Thanks! I‚Äôm not too familiar with some of the armor so I took my best guess üòÇ
---
*Excuse me?*
---
Lol yeah pretty much same here
---
That and ionic traces help a little bit
---
You could build a PC right now for around 600 and itll last for 5 or so years no problem. Maybe not 4k 120fps ultra settings but no consoles can do that either. You only need to upgrade when you cant run the games you want to play at all, and anymore that's longer than the life of a console from one generation to the next
---
Because redrix isn‚Äôt hard to get at all. Literally just need to play. Don‚Äôt need wins or glory ranks. Just play
---
How much are you looking to spend and are you planning on building or buying pre built? I love putting together pcpartpicker lists for people so if you want one I'll do that for ya!
---
I would love a Shaxx one. I have a little funky pop of him that the Mrs gave me.
---
Don't you mean, prebentation?
---
***Y E E T***
---
Yeah Everytime I see this I see the helmet and am disappointed
---
I should‚Äôve used tedious
---
On a high end rig like mine, I can run any game at 4k on ultra settings with 120fps. On top of that we dont have to pay for a live service, we can mod tons of games to insane levels, and we can get games on sale through more stores more frequently.
---
Probably talking about Prime mode
---
After 5 years I'm still trying to figure out why you die and the cabal doesn't in that situation??
---
Either way 1000 IQ play guardian!
---
Is that warframe
---
Yes but for the average player that already struggles but still plays would get crushed because of how much better PC players are
---
Yes
---
Nice
---
Also tru
---
Idk I'm only using 2.6g vram. Could be something in windows or even bios/uefi settings.
---
I will. Was about to delete my Warlock just because I want it to be a male.
---
Yes, you're definitly one of us.
---
Join us brother, it's not too late....
---
The guy that shot that Jotunn at the end of the hallway was outside radar range, and there's the right side that leads to outside mid. Good practice and you never just stand in a doorway, always stutter step and once a corner is peeked, unless you're playing defense or mind games, you always either retreat or move forward.
---
Lol it‚Äôs all good just remember even if you WiFi ur super you can always charge another one, if you hold it you have 0 chance of a kill if you use it at least you will get another one eventually. Always use it for sure.
---
No, you start with 2 special ammo and most of the time a bodyshot with a sniper wont 1hko them, so he swaps to HC to finish them, rather than waste both sniper shots
---
4 guns this game won't let me have:
---
1. Midnight coup (when it's sold I never have the time to finish a raid that week)
---
2. 1k
---
3. Anarchy
---
4. Tarabah
---
Wow, that‚Äôs cool I guess. So basically we have the forsaken exotic dilemma again, great.
---
Yes I am aware of this.
---
Found your post and got a build together for you. Due to Canadian  prices, you just cant pull out as much performance per dollar so I went over your budget a bit but there is room to save some. I built you something that will run destiny 2 on pc at 1080 and 60fps no problem. If you would like anything changed or need any explanation let me know!
---
https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/mzhqLJ
---
No Titan in it. Literally unusable.
---
Good builds for what? Without specifics it's hard to answer your question as what's best for pve isnt always the best for pvp or even pvevp (gambit).
---
Struggling to see the benefit of writing it all down when it‚Äôs already written down on the screen...
---
Ive played since launch and i cant tell you how many times I forget this happens, i should have a special emblem saying how many times ive died to a sparrow by now
---
What platform?
---
We don't talk about titan.  
---
Also, whoever decided a gambit map on titan was a good idea needs to rethink that idea.
---
I reccomend waiting for the massive escalation grind until after you finish the forsaken campaign
---
Yeah theres no way its actually the monitor, for all consoles default settings would be fine on the monitor btw
---
My name is Shaxx Knoxville and this is Jackass D2!!!
---
_Guardian, we must unify and repel the Cabal onslau.....what in the fuck are you doing?_
---
Got one for ya go onto the D2 clan finder and Look up flat earth ninjas we have a discord and the only requirement is to be online regularly
---
More than a couple can, only a couple do. CoD pros could make it as well Im sure.
---
Im not offended about anything, sorry pumpkin.
---
I hope its the boss that drops all 3 weapons. I need the sniper to complete my destinations seal.
---
Well they did put crota in the trailer
---
Well they did put crota in the teaser
---
I dont think it's supposed to but it does
---
As others have stated, you can probably find those kinds of comments on bungie forums pretty easily. Kind of ironic that the bungue forums is where most of the bungie hate comes from. That community is backwards. Some of the comments I've seen on there are absolutely pathetic to say the least.
