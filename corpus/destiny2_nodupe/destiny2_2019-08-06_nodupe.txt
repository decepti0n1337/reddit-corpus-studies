Not to burst your bubble but you were using the most op super and gun in the game. It was impressive but easily done. Erentil and striker are broken
---
The problem with OEM to me is basically that it‚Äôs a tracking exotic with extra perks. Titan‚Äôs not the only class with tracking. Warlocks get Sanguine Alchemy, Hunters get Foetracer, even the entire Spectral tree.
---

---
OEM *is* the only exotic out of those that has buffs on top of the tracking. I think it should have one small buff, not all three. Because without any added buff, it‚Äôs tracking on one person every 10-15 seconds, that requires you to get hurt to activate. But give it maybe a little instant health regen on kill, cool, now we‚Äôre talking.
---
Iirc forsaken complete edition does come with the base game and dlc1&amp;2 (curse of osiris and warmind)
---
Haunted
---
So the one that came free with ps+ a while ago does have dlc 1 and 2?
---
Yeah, that's mentioned in the reply I was replying to.
---
Or is that just the bundle?
---
how many bounties can you hold at a time?
---
Dont think so. Either way if you look up the Forksaken set you want to get itll show you what it contains
---
Ok, thank you
---
Hmph interesting, had no idea, I don't use reddit that much. Just thought it would be a good way to get botters actually banned, but I guess people who want a bot free game are the ones who get banned. My apologies and i'll remove this.
---
**Now this is an Avengers level threat**
---
Lemme introduce you to the magic of Sanguine Alchemy. Could it use a buff? Probably. But it basically gives you tracking on all enemies in a radius
---
No worries, I knew that going in I was rocking them, mainly because I‚Äôm not really good at pvp, So this is me trying to compensate.
---
Noted brother
---
Bungie should add an extra 1/2 percent per run, more if its flawless towards the 1k drop. That's kind of ridiculous if you ask a logically thinking human being.
---
Love that you included your super and that knight kill.
---
Doesn't matter if you're using the weapon or not. The catalyst will drop for all the exotics you've acquired up to this point at random. Having done the math over two months of play, the drop chance is approximately 1%. So out of 100 strikes played you'll get one catalyst. It's been said that higher scoring Nightfalls has a better chance for a catalyst drop, but since there's a significant increase of difficulty involved (not to mention you can't really matchmake for it) regular strikes are still better in my opinion. 
---
Just do the strikes quickly as you can and it'll drop eventually.
---
My bad I don't use reddit that often. Just wanted botters banned. Last time I use reddit holy crap.
---
Yeah i was thinking about it. But i think the biggest problem for most people is they get impatient and ive come to understand the time it will take. Its a slow grind for the most part
---
Always happy to see another fan of Egyptian mythology.
---
It's completely random, they drop out of the chest as an exotic triangle, not engram. There is no manipulation of rng. I have all of the strike catalysts now, after having done a few hundred strikes.
---
They drop more often from Nightfalls, just a tip. So get a buddy and go farm an easy one. This week *The Arms Dealer* is a pretty quick one.
---
1 super and a heavy round with no orbs of light and tweaks to fusion rifles. I‚Äôd much rather be shotgunned than fusion‚Äôd
---
But you don't have to lose your humanity. You still have three weeks to do it.
---
Yeah, well I kinda already got majestic on all 3 so there‚Äôs no going back.
---
The reason I suggested using the weapon was because as I used crimson I got the catalyst(actually i don‚Äôt remember how I got it and I forgot if it comes from it) and thanks, does the medallion help at all for it?

Hey Don't Talk About Gambit.

Yeah I will after I get my warlock the solstice gear, I‚Äôll run a nightfall with buffs and I‚Äôve been grinding the past 60+ hours to get my hunter and titan full solstice, do you know how much of an increase nightfalls give? 0.2+?

I recognize the CoS raid helmet and chest armor.

Those are the blade barrage mains, we do not include them in our gatherings.

That‚Äôs an inefficient strategy to use a shotgun properly you need to wait behind a corner then when your target is close enough slide around the corner most people won‚Äôt expect the camper to move

So I‚Äôm playing the base game on xbox and progressing my character. If I buy forsaken bundle on pc, will I be able to transfer my xbox character even though it didn‚Äôt have the dlc?
---
At release Dawnblade was literally bugged and didn‚Äôt kill anyone 90% of the time, but that was fixed real fast because that was Warlocks‚Äô cool new replacement super

Well done üëç

Well there goes the planet...
---
If Shaxx died, I'd never leave a grenade unthrown again.
---
I am not sure this is good advice, since there will be a different armor system for year 3, and we don't know how obsolete it will make year 1 and 2 armor.
---
&gt; I know a lot of people have much less time to play than I do, but I really don't think 15 strikes, 15 Gambit/and or Crucible matches, 15 or so EDZ runs and patrols/public events are that crazy in a MONTH long event.
---
Not everybody wants to spend multiple hours within day (like myself) or multiple play sessions to grind out a set of armor that also forces you to equip said armor on all those missions with no worthwhile perks all to get the armor to a level in which it will have perks that may not fit your particular playstyle.
---
Playing 25 patrols, Killing 100 minibosses, &amp; obtaining 1500 orbs is not fun anyway you slice it.
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; Do a couple a day, pay attention to what activities want you to make what kind of orbs, and I don't see why you couldn't accomplish this easily in a month. 
---
Much like I can't see why when Bungie planned this why the development team thought to themselves "This is fine".
---
Brother Vance is on the top of my hitlist. Asher's gonna die anyway since his vex arm is consuming his body, and no-one remembers sloane.
---
Drifter's just gonna make it run for it when the darkness comes, and it'll probably be what kills him.
---
Am I just seeing things or do they have an exotic power level?
---
The power surge is available for every character, regardless of how many you create or delete. 
---
You must own Forsaken, be level 50, and complete the Forsaken campaign in order to access the 690 power surge quest.
---
I don't think it's genric. There is actually a lot of depth even in the red war. Considering how many stories there are written games, books, novels, series. We have seen everything at some point this everything is generic if we seen it enough.
---
how about we get him to decrypt one of the trickster's engrams
---
Recently got back into destiny 2 on a different platform  playing catch up now, looking for a group to play the game with so I can do the exotic quests/raids that require full fireteam psn is kryffy
---
There is a small amount of unique dialogue for exos and, if you own Forsaken, a decent amount for awoken, if it makes a difference to you.
---
ss the week

You can get the glow now and it will work now and later. It's like having an ornament, its permanently unlocked
---
Spongebob/me: "I NEED IT!"
---
Imagine working there and you come in one day, the butt crack of dawn, barely awake not paying attention and all of the sudden there is a captain about to clap your cheeks
---
Im torn between saving up for the glowy armor or buying this thing off the bat
---
Ya. I have not gotten any emails from bungo. I just simply want my cool shirt. Its the first thing i have ever bpught from their merch store. Its actually the firat merch i have ever bought. I am not much of a merch person, but i really lile this shirt. A lot.
---
Heavy made Gambit unplayable.
---
But seriously though, sorry you ran into afks. If they are afking Gambit matches, then they probably haven't done the other objectives either (orbs, kills), so they have to suffer through that with everyone else. Good luck, hope you get better teams next time!
---
Sauce for original?
---
Soloing a normal strike is, effectively, doing a nightfall solo (if your light is above the nightfall's requirement, that is).  Heroic story missions are solo already.
---
Same. I have bought tons though and never felt like I was led on about getting it in time. With all that been going on for them with taking more time to work on shadowkeep I was willing to be as patient as I was with my last shirt. I‚Äôm sure it won‚Äôt be much longer, have faith. üòé
---
It's the better game
---
Ya. I Will. Its my first merch and i am excited for it. And i am glad they are taking ectra time for shadowkeep too. I hope its more the worth the wait
---
Absolutely no one:

---

---
Huh?
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong they definitely added a ton of cool ones and the weapon shaders are perfect but for armor just make it one shader for chrissakes
---
I‚Äôve been with their stuff since marathon. I know especially now with actisatan that it will be worth the time. Especially with the shirt. :)
---
One two punch + liars handshake = Big fun
---
After the red war their were giant pieces floating around and missing and you could see inside the traveler, it looked super odd and weird
---
Plus their rings of smaller materials floating around the traveler like rings, now most are gone and most of the pieces are in place, plus marking on the traveler are glowing
---
The one thing there that I really wanted was the Whisper of the Worm replica they had made by AurumEffects.
---
Wait... Is it a curated roll? I don't know how raid weaponry works.
---
I knew I saved that shotgun for a good reason.
---
To be fair you can‚Äôt, after all it‚Äôs pretty far away
---
You have to complete the entire set and then it will all upgrade to blue. i wish it worked like one at a time but you gotta do it all.
---
Would not be disappointed with that.
---
No one knows. Btw bungie did say they have noticed increased grenade launcher usage and have decided to need fusion rifles and hunters. /s
---
Nope, they stay on the armour. Also when upgrading. For example, if you have the drained (green) armour set, and equip the glow, and upgrade to renewed (blue) then the armour glow will stay on the armour. Also ty get to keep the armour and the glow when solstice ends
---
you could until the last update using skull of dire ahamkara you inbred degenerate. same way you can spam unlimited blade barrage you reddit warrior sack of shit. go kill some people in real life like a good american.
---
Fantastic movie.
---
So... I can have a gun with super shitty stats, but huge power? What good does that do me?
---
I cannot answer number 1, sorry.
---
As for number 2, it might be because it‚Äôs an annual pass triumph, which (I‚Äôm assuming) you haven‚Äôt bought yet.
---
Number 3, different guns come with set amounts of impact, range, handling, etc. and cannot be changed aside from the weapon‚Äôs perks. Power level applies an overall buff to the entire character, not just to the gun itself. 
---
Number 4, there unfortunately isn‚Äôt a way other than just memorizing the general ammo reserves. If you‚Äôd like to know, just ask me.
---
There are two available!

---
You can buy it here
---
Power level is what gets you into activities and what determines your damage output in certain things. Gun stats are the actual statistics of the weapon you‚Äôre using. As of right now starting out, the only thing that matters is power level.
---
Once you get higher in power level, you‚Äôll start worrying about which weapons to use and what rolls they have. Which platform do you play on?
---
This is against all laws of nature
---
I wouldn't say it's shit but it's not as stupid as it was previously.
---
WHO THE FUCK LIKES CAPTAINS?!?! THEY ARE FUCKING PUSSIES AND THE MOST ANNOYING ENEMY TO DEAL WITH, THOSE SHITBAGS CONSTANTLY RUN AWAY!!! YOU LAY A FINGER ON THEM AND THEY FUCKING TELEPORT AND START RUNNING!!!

DAMNIT MOON MOON!
---
So... fighting lion?
---
Thank you!
---
titans had skating in d1.. pretty much it outside of pre nerf HoS which didnt last very long..
---
bout time titans get neutral as good as hunters and warlocks.. but skating is gone now. outside of striker the kills supers on warlock and hunter are better or just as good.. god forbid titans get what hunters and warlock had reigned supreme with in neutral for the past 5 years.. they finally got a meta exotic, along with tools for neutral, lunge melees, suppress nade, and barricade
---
but......  oem will probably get another treatment with how you people complain about it, striker with get nerfed with how you people complain about, then titans get what?? suppress nade on void, lunges on another class and barricade? back to hunter and warlock meta neutral here we come.. the nutty thing is i still find my self wanting to play the neutral with hunter and warlock rather than my titan even with all the so called "overpowered" state its in.. and yes its good but its about time dont you think.. maybe titans should get a turn! 
---
shotguns been overpowered and rule the meta for 5 years straight.. oh look they still are the meta right now!! 
---
what do i really expect when the community just complain about anything that isnt suiting there agenda of lower skill and average skill level which is getting free kills with super, heavy weapons, or doesnt allow them to trade and go 1 kill 1 death all day warrioring their shotgun.. 5 years in, i should know this by now.. the scrubs opinions rule all! sad thing is bungie actually caters to that shit.
---
 try a primary weapon or sniper not on the hunter class children, its quite fun once you can rid your brain of auto piloting and running into a crowd with a shotgun just to get one kill and die over and over!!
---
people are really out here complaining and downvoting the truth and balance away.. its honestly why majority of kill in the crucible every game come from super, heavy, shotgun, melees.. if it ruins people getting away with free kill using low skill crutch better believe the crucible community will be complaining about it!
---
d1 cruce since day one with 100s of thousands of kills in the crucible... trust
---
Show off cosmetics.
---
I've just had a look at it comparing it to a picture from 2017 (vanilla after red war) and it looks to be exactly the same unfortunately :/
---
I break laws
---
No, fighting lion has a lion on it, gjallarhorn has wolves and different styling.
---
That‚Äôs really weird, when I looked yesterday their was only one part missing in the top right and it had three glowing light circles on it‚Äôs face
---
I was 1900. Figured i win 1 and wait for reset. But it went down hill from there. Now im at 900 trying to recover.
---
Gary brings up a good point
---
Man I feel good for you, but I'm just reminded by the fact that I've had two different runs and getting exotics from each...but they're exotics that replace a raid drop...
---
That kinda made me the big sad. Not gonna lie
---
The position of the ‚Äòhunters‚Äô hand had me concerned for a bit there...
---
Bad juju with 5x curse doesn't do as much dps as huckleberry only spun up (no rampage)
---
A small price to pay for salvation.
---
The weapons are just situational, if you need mid/long range than use the bad juju and if you just need to spray down alot of ads at short range, use the Huckleberry. I think both weapons are balanced in their own way
---
I would punch it.
---
*punching intensifies*
---
For me I used top tree nightstalker with sixth coyote because double dodge and invis helped me in tight spots...but regardless of what advise you use I wish you luck.
---
oh you should it's so much more fun than Truth/ MG or whatever is the meta
---
Thank you very much for the best answer
---
I think some of the others were a little confused 
---
What is the best stuff to roll on the erintil
---
I assume I want charge time or range as the actual stat but what about the mods
---
It may not be shopped, there is a hidden room under EAZ. Tricky to get into but that cat statue is on the left side of the room. There is also a bricked up archway and a set of steel doors. 
---
Can get there is a crevice left of the spawn on area towards town where the prismatic fallen usually spawn. Drop down and you will come to a tunnel, go to bars , call sparrow get close to bars and dismount sparrow. You should now be inside the room.
---
I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure the Lord of wolves got nerfed
---
I haven't seen anyone using at the past two days
---
I‚Äôm not sure how to activate it mostly. I‚Äôve tried multiple different times but for some reason I simply can‚Äôt jump into the portal
---
when you'll have it you'll never take it off your heavy slot
---
No worries thanxs anyways.
---
Randall the VANdal? Must smell like fallen inside, I'm sure cayde woulda recognized that smell.
---
Exactly the game doesn't even make sense , looks like they are going cash in while they can, the whole game is just a cash grab , it could be a good game but it doesn't deliver,
---
I probably will never get it because I can't find people to raid with.
---
Pretty sure you're right about the boots too.
---
so you're saying that the BS is "balanced" when Seismic Strike, a *FAR SAFER* melee, kills in one hit AND kills everyone around the user?
---
and no, it wouldn't be broken for TS because it order to "abuse" it, you have to run melee dodge over reload dodge, and if you're going all in you HAVE to use the sixth coyote.
---
tell me, why should I NOT have a 1-hit kill melee for middle tree *WHEN I'M STUCK IN THE AIR IN ONE POSITION FOR A WHOLE SECOND*?
---
‚ÄúBalance? *That‚Äôs a name I haven‚Äôt heard in a long time.* I don‚Äôt ever wanna hear it again either‚Äù -Bungo‚Äôs now sentient nerf hammer

I did not just see... a warlock... on a 1cm sparrow going 300mph front flips. And kill a hunter while doing so after hitting a Vex ring on the side of a baby batter waterfall...

Probably just an early build,  this hunter also doesn‚Äôt have a hood
---
Not on my watch!

**I** will clap them cheeks!
---
Oh yeah for sure,just stating that huckleberry is kind of nuts,it can beat shotguns dps with rampage *3

I heard that! I can‚Äôt wait!

How is a decent pulse rifle and a shotty not a balanced and often recommended loadout for everyone? üòé

Re-equip your chest armor to remove visual bug.
---
Yeah that thing is insane and i don't even have the masterwork for it yet!
---
I hope I can toggle it on and off because my clan consist of two people so there‚Äôs no point seeing the banner. It just reminds me of how bad we are
---
Now you know how I feel whenever my hunter loses his cape. I‚Äôve just lost the heart of the hunter.
---
The way I see it, if they're not banning people, they're allowing it. If people are getting banned, we would see much less botters today. Things can only get worse once this hits free to play. Currently we have no notices for bungie, no acknowledgement, nothing. A lack of response is sort of a response in itself.
---
I didn't play D1 so I'm always amazed by how the Traveller looked before, all prinstine and such. For example, I did not know until now, that it had a giant symbol illuminating the City.
---
My mistake. I'm a solo player, so I tend to forget that just because I generally have to LFG for 2 extra players does not mean that everyone else also has to do that. Haha
---
Also @OP, I would recommend running snipers. At least one, but preferably 2. Whisper or DARCI if you have one of them. Makes all shriekers much easier because you can generally one or 2 shot them without much difficulty, and it helps out a lot if you can put a lot of distance between you and the knights to take them out relatively quickly. Also helps with the ogre that comes out, and helps a lot with DPS against the Song.
---
Do you happen to have some screencaps to compare?
---
My friend never told me about trevor. he just said there was a robot that gets you.  
---
  
---
I was not prepared....
---
I got 4 anarchys in 17 runs rip
---
Also got my tarrabah in 17 runs
---
Its probably the strongest destiny build of all time for dmg at this point, theres lots of videos of people killing raid bosses in seconds with it
---
I never said anything about my opinions on the crucible‚Äôs current META.
---
Middle tree arcstrider plays very differently to Spectral Blades and Blade Barrage, so you‚Äôre kinda comparing apples to oranges here.
---
Thundercrash Titans have enercia override, which is fairly powerful in itself.
---
If you‚Äôre expecting to be able to survive jumping directly at the enemy team with zero cover and survive while killing them, I think you‚Äôre forgetting something. This is a melee ability, not a super. And then there‚Äôd be the problem of Skullfort.
---
No
---
Complete it.
---
Bruh, Dawnblade is not as hard. It‚Äôs tracking is as poor as Jotunn‚Äôs, the casting time on it gives people time to either team shoot or run away, When Strikers cast their super. They literally slam into the ground as an attack. Dawnblade is only effective from far away so you can just go around corners and your good.

Thanks I asked this question and got told it‚Äôs when everyone dies in restricted zone but then I watched Jez die like 20 times and figured that wasn‚Äôt right then
---
There doesn't seem to be really any removed exotics in D2 I know of. D1 has the fate of all fools pulse but that probably doesn't count, you can maybe count pocket infinity as removed from d1 as it never got a updated version for rise of iron.
---
Seasonal eververse armor, ships, sparrows, ghosts; iron banner armor &amp; original versions of weapons; faction rally weapons and armor; trials weapons.

There are no exotic weapons and armor that are unobtainable.

Titan is really fun in pve. Punching dregs makes you feel like a god and OEM is pretty useful too. It's just the one's that only ever use OEM in crucible and refuse to accept that it's OP that i dislike. Even PvP bottom tree striker is nowhere near as bad as OEM-Exclusive crucible titans.

Its not about frames...its a still image. One looks like it doesnt have a light source, the other does. One is flat, one is vibrant

That looked rough, but GG. Next time try doing DPS at his feet, A well at his feet, C and P are behind A to the left and right respectively. Then, for the Phase before the Phase radiances, Have everyone in A well using shotguns with a melting point on. Then when he flashes, split up and everyone pulls out Darci. Once you have the Phase radiance buff, use your golden gun, and then unload your Darci as fast as you can into the boss. Do the next phase radiance, and he should be dead. Easy one Phase.

A man of culture, I see.
---
Random world drop now! Plus you have a higher chance of getting exotics you don't own over repeats. Good luck guardian!
---
Huckleberry is one of those overlooked weapons that rarely ever gets talked about but is actually pretty damn good. Love my bad juju too though and both are great for different things, one for range and pvp and one for close range and clearing trash mobs.
---
I love when Hunters complain about getting killed twice by the same super as if they forget that the arc staff is the largest culprit of it.
---
Most major difference is that panel that was in the top left is reattached
---
If someone is right behind me i will leave it. But I have also tried that the other ones does not kill it and I have to run back and do it. Thats why people just melt em. Blame it on the devs for making an activity where you are rewarded for being selfish.
---
I wish I have been trying to get one...

But then you get booty, Warlocks have no booty

this looks so awesome

They'll probably do it so that you can't get in melee distance to the boss, like the Gerden World boss.

I‚Äôm out of town on vacation but it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if the nerfs finally went through.
---
I‚Äôm so glad you commented this. There‚Äôs actually a huge correlation with that strike which is probably why it‚Äôs a meme. The hidden meaning behind it I believe is whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
1. It‚Äôs hilarious to me how you think just because I play hunter i don‚Äôt hold hunters to the same rule.
---
2. Arc Staff not even close to the largest culprit. Doesn‚Äôt even compare to striker Titan unless you‚Äôre wearing Raiden Flux and even then it doesn‚Äôt last as long.
---
that wizard came from there
---
Did you step out of a time machine from the Y1 Warmind meta? I don‚Äôt think Arcstaff even cracks the top three of Roaming supers with multi-kill potential. Bottom tree striker and bottom tree dawn blow it out of the water in terms of mobility and length of super. Both allow super return on kills and have better movement options in shoulder charge and burst glide, respectively. I‚Äôd also class top tree stormcaller and spectral blades over Arcstaff for duration and multikill potential. Arcstaff has a nice niche as a roaming super with anti-super potential, but a cross-map killer it is not.
---
Yes, like I said,

You have to keep doing the quest line to get the perks
---
my luck: grenades bounces back and detonates in my face killing me anyways.
---
I thought it was actually shedding its 'skin' to reveal its real form underneath. I might possibly be mistaken that it's actually the other way around.
---
You lucked out.  Wish this had happened to me in my 30 games.
---
Thank you! I‚Äôll look up the rest now
---
You have to do the quest to unlock the perks. You should have bounties and every bounty you finish for the lumina quest will unlock a perk for the rose
---
If you complete a solstice armor set it‚Äôll be max light
---
Correction: YOU can deflect a sentinel shield with a Grenade.
---
I dunno. I've always platformed better with standard jumps. I suicide way less with my hunter than my warlock. Also, St0mp-EE5 are no laughing matter. They will -really- let you do some scaling.
---
Crosspost this to r/HitBoxPorn .
---
Nice! I'm glad they've been saved, they're awesome.
---
Tbf its only games like these that can get you thousands of hours of enjoyment out of. 
---
I love grindy games, I love grinding for items even if Im not guaranteed them.
---
If I have to pay like $100+ dollars to get hundreds to thousands of hours of enjoyment, well money well spent I say.
---
So keep me in the cycle I say!
---
\^\^\^This with telesto or recluse wrecks and may be one of the best add clear builds in the game, especially if you have the "light reactor" perk. Running Attunement of Fission (middle tree) you can get your super by the end of the first wave if you are aggressive enough.
---
If you are going for full blown boss melt, run Geomag Stabilizers.
---
If you are trying to actually help your team, luna faction in a well.
---
The glows are ornaments. They have nothing to do with anything else.
---
Im at 48, feel ya
---
Also, shield reflected to a different hallway filled with the rest of your team.
---
Nope purely cosmetic, and yes they do stay after the event.
---
There‚Äôs hope after all.
---
How did you get in there?
---
They‚Äôre completely cosmetic but they do stay after the event and if you get a full set you can use it in shadowkeep.
---
Also the effect is brighter if you use the corresponding subclass and colour so if you‚Äôre only getting one get it for the subclass you play the most.
---
Glory. 
---
That's the word you're looking for in comp. Valor is regular Crucible. You get an amount of glory every weekly reset if you've played three games that week.
---
Now I‚Äôm waiting for the vid of a sentinel getting smoked by his own shield
---
The glows are cosmetic. They do not give any bonuses. They will remain after the Solstice event ends.
---
Don‚Äôt you have to complete the set before the event ends? I wanted to do all 3 classes but I don‚Äôt see that happening.
---
As long as you land just a shot on them it counts I found, cause I had these guys who would obliterate the mini bosses, and a shot is all I would get and still count towards the progress
---
When Zavala chose not to pledge the full strength of the Vanguard to avenge Cayde, I lost all faith in him. Ikora had the right of it, doing nothing makes the Guardians look weak and opens us up to further attack. Zavala needs to step down, or be put down for good. That man will be the death of all of us if we don't take him out.

This must be fake. According to twitch chat and content creators supers cant be killed. And you kill 2, rooooight üòâ. Ggwp mah dude

Master working doesn‚Äôt effect light, it comes 750 on the legendary set
---
Great question. Maybe the three dots? I'm not sure and I'm at work so I can't check.
---
I literally did this about 2 weeks ago and recorded it. I was laughing my ass off. The shield still bounced and got me tho.
---
!Remindme 1 day
---
Yeah a friend told me that a few days ago, as well as leaving after the first phase of the EAZ event. K shot up to over 50 in half an hour yesterday.
---
Mostly, it just feels bad. It seems counter intuitive for a group event to not provide group progress in one aspect, but does in another. It also feels bad for the most efficient method to be "first phase, leave, repeat".
---

---
They‚Äôre ornaments and nothing more
---
You do
---
Mine had zero mobility also...
---
why is Gamora?
---
I did it for 3 hours last night. Wasn‚Äôt too bad actually. The main thing I need done now is the gambit and eaz ones. Those will take some time though
---
Wether we wanted to or to or not, we‚Äôve stepped into a war with the cabal. So let‚Äôs get to taking out... Zavala
---
Context: someone complained about OEM being ugly and I made a counter to that by saying it has a fucking beanie
---
i opened 80 packages and didn‚Äôt get a single enhanced perk :(
---
Iron banner had a few
---
Tiny little space ghosts
---
It's important to remember that there is a generational aspect to this as well-
---
OG gamers, gamers who grew up expecting games that are complete upon release, games that give hundreds/thousands of hours of gameplay by NOT limiting loot...we don't accept this bullshit modern rationale for addictive gameplay loops like Destiny.
---
The younger generation is fine with it. It's telling that your response is based around the cost to gameplay ratio and NOT the fact that Destiny was designed specifically to be addictive and controlling. That is disrespectful as fuck to ALL gamers, and the fact that so many kids will continue to enrich companies like Bungie and Activision shows that this trend will continue. And that is incredibly sad.
---
Indeed
---
spank bank.
---
"I see this as an absolute win!"
---
The stupidity of your response proves my point.
---
Console I hope?
---
I'm gonna try that next time
---
Tekken....NBA2K....Borderlands.....Metal Gear Solid.... Dude, there are MANY games that can give thousands of hours of gameplay while NOT fucking with their audience using casino tricks and other bullshit. You are flat out wrong on this, kid.
---
Tiny worm gods
---
What iron banner is, is a fun, dumb, fast-paced gamemode, where one does not have to think about neither positioning, gun setup, or perks. One can just jump in and play.
---
It might be a different game, but the concept of a "competetive" gamemode remains the same. Skill should be what makes the player, not the perks, levels or anything else. Only thing that matters is the player.
---
Not really.
---
I get what you're saying, but that's not how Destiny is. 
---
But still doesn't explain Trials. Trials is a competitive mode with light enabled. How is that any different?
---
You get the 'oops looks like you left a match in progress' warning when you leave. These are broken lobbies that stay open forever because no one called a primeval. The bank disappears and enemies despawn. So there's no conclusion. So no loss.
---
I got 1k in 3 chests also
---
Headshotting people out of super is more satisfying than using your super to kill a super
---
Problem is that'll just lead to people randomly voting to kick others. That's what happened in Sea of Thieves and a few other games. Especially when levels are so easy to see.
---
It's the most efficient method at the moment, unfortunately. Along with leaving after the first phase to reque. I agree that it's super shitty. Doesn't make sense to me at all why bungie separated them.
---
Remind him/her of the utter bull$h1&amp; that is the mech with missiles.
---
Yeah, you kinda are. Last word maybe, gaviton and mida? Nope. I would say OEM or dust rock would be more of a crutch.
---
Did all three sets this solstice and last. The last solstice i only had a titan, so i finished my armor on titan and made a hunter and warlock, completed the entire story on both of the characters and the armor. All within one week. Finished this seasons within a week as well
---
Micro mini is no longer on the store for bright dust I think
---
Haha thanks, I take my fashion very seriously.
---
Yes
---
Oh yeah, this is big brain time.
---
You are able to get exotics, I have had it happen to me before.
---
You‚Äôll get there!
---
Thanks for the input, I was pretty positive I would want to prioritize the glow, the Micro Mini seems to be too popular for Bungo to not put in Bright Engrams, glow it is!
---
Geomag stabilizers hands down. Crazy primeval damage and you get two or three supers a round if you use masterwork orbs right. It's the most fun build to use to wipe out a while wave of enemies quick.
---
Imgur comments üôÑüôÑ
---
You get it.  Only have to hit 2100 once.
---
Isn‚Äôt  it? I saw last night for 2500 Bright Dust, but I suppose that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs still there
---
And before anyone asks, the reason I'm soloqueing is because none of my friends play D2. I know I should just "git gud", but it's a little hard when I'm constantly getting teamshotted.
---
I know there are already posts criticising the pathetic excuse for Crucible matchmakimg, but I need to vent, because this system seems intent on making my Recluse grind a living hell.
---
KONO DIO DA
---
AMAZING GUARDIAN
---
Big pp time
---
I saw this aswell a while ago
---
Any age is welcomed to visit!
---
Did you check your pursuits tab? You might have something in there tied to the quest you haven't completed yet.
---
It does from time to time. Can think of a handful or so times ive pulled it off, either luck lag or frame perfect timing. Couldn't tell you which
---
Finally I get to attempt to get the mind benders ambition.
---
That‚Äôs happened to me before
---
I was on the receiving end of the deflection
---
Yes, but why would you want suros?
---
I plan to when my trio eventually gets there. we lost our regular raid crew so we gotta trio it
---
Since you know so much about how to play control to win you should have a really high control win rate correct? I mean at LEAST 55%.
---
I disagree. Got my at 15 runs now total i think 30 in total and gotten 6.
---
What a dumbass
---
I got it as well, but sadly it's with a Reload masterwork :(
---
Wonderful Guardian!
---
Remember that I'm not 100% certain of what I said, so don't take just my word. I'd wait for other people to reply, either correcting or confirming what I stated before making any final decisions
---
It will count if you reach the fabled step for Luna this season. It will not carry over into next season.
---
Pretty sure as long as its in the same season its retroactive, I got LH and Recluse at about the same time last season so I doubt it changed
---
Gotcha, thanks again, it‚Äôll be a few hours before I can continue my grind anyway
---
This reminds me of all the special physics interactions that could take place in old Halo games.
---
Like deflecting a rocket launcher with a plasma grenade, or with another rocket.
---
Can I have your sheer amount of luck? Is it possible for a Warlock to attain this power?
---
Oh god they know
---
Its not like its a 4 week event, not to bad.  Just dont go in expecting to be done in a day or two.  Then we'd all complain it was to easy or short.
---
You can basically get it to chain non stop
---
You can masterwork the armor after the event, but not upgrade it in rarity. [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/cmht6j/explanation_of_solstice_of_heroes_and_advice_of/)
---
Haha for 5 hours of pain it can be you
---
If you are a returning player, yes since it drops at 750 light when purple.
---
It's outrageous! It's unfair!
---
Cool man
---
I've heard from friends that icarus grip is fun if you want a D1 feel. What's the roll you have on it, maybe a mod might synergise with one of your perks
---
On sale for 35 rn
---
Cheesed it?
---
Thank you fam
---
rampage and snapshot sights
---
Yes it is from purple to masterwork
---
Well a rampage spec would work alongside it if you've got one from ada
---
Super well done!  I‚Äôd buy tickets to this today. Ever consider doing a full movie?
---
Not all people are going to get the most powerful weapon in the game and that‚Äôs fine it‚Äôs supposed to be rare not make every activity stupidly easy
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping to drop through the packages when I can open them
---
Specific to year 1 exotics you can do Leviathan raids, especially Calus. On prestige difficulty you can drop the Contender shell from the boss which can help getting exos you don't already have from clearing any encounter. Even with my shitty rng it was very helpful.
---
When you drop powerful engrams let them go to your post instead of picking them up, it may retain prime attunement for longer which gives you much better chances too.
---
Having already ground out all 3 legendary sets let me just say I‚Äôm much happier now than I was a week ago
---
I was totally thinking terminator 2 but SIVA works too
---
What does Ep mean?
---
It worked really well with fighting lion
---
Now if an enemy drop an exotic engram, when u pick it up, it will decrypt for u automatically, the gear goes into ur inventory. A powerful gear reward might have a chance to give u an exotic drop, u get those powerful gear rewards by completing challenges, milestones, bounties, etc. The other way of guarantee exotics is purchasing from Xur, which is an vendor that appears in various locations during the weekend. Each week there will be 4 random exotics gear(including forsaken exotics) in his inventory, a weapon and  one armor for each class that has a random role. Xur will also be selling an exotic engram the rewards an exotic gear that u never owned(including forsaken exotics as well), which is a pretty good way on getting non duplicate exotic without the blessing of RNjesus.

Hope u found this helpful:)
---
nice thank you man
---
twinks?
---
Its still stupid imo cause it's not fair for people like me that love the game but can't play it all day for several hours... In d1 you got everything over time and the event is not allways there what makes it pretty hard to get it... I would not complain if the event stays forever.
---
Look absolutely awesome!
---
I mean if you offering guardian. Can I leave the helmet on?
---
The same thing masterworking any other piece of armor does. The MMXIX title also requires masterworking one piece of solstice armor.
---
It makes the armour masterworked. Just to flex basicly
---
Is that a smiley face on the moon. Top left
---
Tinkleage?
---
I found a solution. A weird one. It's in the edit for the post. Ty for your advice and support. :)
---
I'm still trying to get 200 void grenade kills. It's not fun.
---
With raiden flux, you can kinda counter it, and I'm pretty sure that arc staff sends out shock waves during one of its attacks, so it's range is quite nice, BUT striker is definitely still busted. I dunno about its hit reg though.
---
aincrad looking view
---
I got mostly done with the first set and realized I would have to do it 2 more times.
---
I have it up and running now. Thank you. It is an action packed experience for sure. Music is amazing for the fights.
---
"Time commitment doesn't equal difficulty"
---
You hit the nail on the head.
---
Tip:whenever you lose a game take a small break.
---
Whenever you start playing, have atleast 1 warmup game in QP
---
Shot Sundance (Cayde‚Äôs Ghost) then uldren shot Cayde.
---
This one was a mix of the teleport w/ lion rampants and my teammates not ruining the shot by picking up a chest. I personally like this much more than the first one.
---
It's so powerful that it trivialises most endgame activities. The power creep of grenade launchers in general do. All GL's are probably gonna take the L at some point but mountaintop is a particularly notorious offender
---
How I unlock that profile cape?
---
What shotgun is that?
---
If you watch a video by ninja pups it's a good idea for weapons but for exotics mostly sixth coyote, stompees, and orpheus rig.
---
Nice.
---
.....uhhhh. okay?
---
What do you mean?
---
Honestly same.
---
Heck yeah
---
I played laser tag but was one day out on the deadline üò°
---
Also by combining a exo kinetix primary. Can easily overcome dps issue. Keeping a melting point w. Ikelos shotee and outbreak perfected or sunspot w calus mini tool (don tgot recluse) and arbalest. Pretty much handles all situations except special raid specialty weapon xhoices
---
This isn't Destiny related.
---
If you were at 2030 you should have stopped playing, that‚Äôs on you
---
