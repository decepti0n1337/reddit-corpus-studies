Ah yeah, now I remember. It's been a while since I watched it
---
---
---
Time for a re-watch!
---

---
^^^S2 ^^^where?
---
Ty!
---
I legitimately thought that was it. That‚Äôs what I was told and it worked for me. If it‚Äôs something else then let him know there‚Äôs no need to be pissed if someone else was misinformed but lucky.
---
no.
---
When I was grinding for Luna's Howl, I got all of the quest steps done solo along with most of the glory points and all I needed was fabled. 
---
I was stuck around 1400-1600 glory for about 2 weeks so I decided to get an LFG going. After many win and loss streaks I was finally at 2096 glory 4 hours later.
---
Me and my team were winning a countdown match 5-1 with 1 player left alive on the other team. I started to get a little cocky knowing I was 1 kill away from my beloved Luna's Howl and tried a 360 quick scope for the win. I sadly missed and died, that guardian followed that up with a team wipe nova bomb and his team ended up rolling over us with 5 straight rounds all undefeated.
---
After that point I went on a massive losing streak and went back down to 1400 glory. You could say I was emotionally and mentally drained. 
---
In the end, I got that damned Luna's Howl a month later, 5 days before the season was over and Black Armory dropped. 
---
Don't give up guardian, you've got this!
---
imagine being this much of a tard
---
This is the first one I've seen of this particular post, I think the "Karma Farm" they're referring to is just the whole "moon's haunted" schtick in general. No need to delete this post, and I'm glad to see that credit to the original is on there!
---
They‚Äôre busy having fun with the first 26 Grumps
---
I also ask myself that when I watch the re:zero trailer season 2
---
His voice grinds the fuck out of me. The way he speaks is so unnatural and he does this thing at the end of every sentence.
---
There is no way to sort it out. You have to re-grind those pieces.
---
&gt; On a serious note, WTF make them blue Bungie?
---
Nice, way to make your mistake someone elses problem. I knew they would be blue and made sure to lock them as soon as I got them. This really seems like it just on you for not paying attention.
---
Dopeness!
---
Do you have an Instagram I can follow? This is great
---
At least it has a S2 confirmed! ;-;
---
Yeah, if the stomp is a problem, thats the teams issue. I just ran it last night with 3 titans and a warlock (no tether) and we beat all 4 in a row, no wipes. 
---
You just gotta deal with them quick enough so that the stomp isn't an issue. THATS the challenge.
---
Oof 100
---
The mods really need to make this a thread.
---
O mesmo soloing the entire raid. Not only the final boss
---
Budgie? You said it twice...
---
Whatever. Don't be a Grammer Nazi you know what I'm talking about so what's the point bro?
---
Prolly the two grenades you get with top tree...
---
Grinding.
---
Not patched yet. Enjoy the cheese while you can.
---
I love science
---
You‚Äôre making go to titan for something not the flashpoint to see this
---
I'm talking about the Cayde-6 items &amp; the bow ornament. I guess they won't appear until I start the Forsaken campaign.
---
Lol Houndish is just as bad if not worse. Dude puts out 15 vids covering the same topics but with different wording.
---
O P T I M A L D P S
---
R.I.P
---
God i remember grinding out the Sunless Cell for the Alak-Hul helmet
---
Heavy is the crown
---
Wait..... that stuff was a preorder for forsaken.   So it‚Äôs not available anymore as a preorder bonus.  BUT it is available thru Eververse.  Last week they had the ornament for Ace if Spades.  This week it‚Äôs the Queen of Hearts ship.
---
Your example is very bad.
---
Oh so the customer payed for a shit product which then they gave it free once improved? And already paid for a product the offer is not extended to me, what i get is customer service after 2 years...
---
Truly you sound like ‚Äúone of those guys‚Äù if you read and understood what i‚Äôve wrote, you would have a different argument...
---
i want RSPN Reboot pls eververse
---
heheheheh, thank you
---
No. I was talking about that guy that said "I don't understand why everything has to revolve around you" because he was being a dick. Kinda the reason I deleted the post because I don't wanna argue with anyone
---
Hey man dont worry too much about me being offensive its just how i am to people and it doesn't have anything to do with the game  its just my way of talking, no harm meant to be done
---
Dude you're good
---
Oof bro that was me lol
---
So it could be near the Himalayas?
---
I kinda wonder if come shadowkeep theyre gonna just have all ornaments and armor be in the loot pool. Thats how it should be. I get they were like season exclusives, but come on
---
Oh well shots fired üòÇ
---
This is peak humor at steak here
---
Yea that‚Äôs i how I liked preforsaken it was cool grinding for the ornaments I‚Äôd still use my crucible ornaments that took a shit ton of sniper kills to get I liked the grind
---
I‚Äôve seen many people say it‚Äôs good, but not really about what‚Äôs making it good. But if they haven‚Äôt added / changed anything in 9 months then maybe I only need one question; is it essentially the same as before? Is movement, TTK and general pace the same? 
---
It does sound like the meta has improved since I last played though. It was all arcstriders, all scouts, and basically only long range fighting. Thanks for the input!
---
üòÇ got em
---
Dude just wait for like 2-3 weeks it‚Äôll be waaay easier that‚Äôs what I do every season
---
Ttk is generally in the .8s or lower with cqc weapons having as low as .50ish so the ttk is alot faster and movement is pretty good now ngl although the go fast update was the one that changed that i think and with introduction of snipers shotties and fusions be added tto primary and secondary slots the pace is alot faster, you fan honestly use whatever gun combo you like and succeed
---
Because of pvp weap grind, no using Jotunn.  But come IB, mumuhhahahaha.
---
To bad we are only peeking at the peak
---
Farm away while you can. Get the god rolls
---
&gt; \-Loads LMG with religious yet malicious intent- 
---
Sounds like we shall be purging the Xenos.
---
\-Loads Bolter with Imperious intent-
---
Another one that bugs me is people using role instead of roll when talking about perks.
---
WOW
---
I like him. His titles can be a little bit click baitey, not entirely but kinda. I will say my favorite Aussie for d2 is more console.
---
Did you message him first? You're the problem, brother.
---
Bungie removes titan skating, I'll find another way to skate!

What if you‚Äôre on Vostok tho? Then it‚Äôs Peaking peeking.
---
Any meme with the king of dragons gets a thumbs up in my book
---
...You know, about 25 minutes ago I was in Crucible and I actually managed to kill someone with it. Around the same time you sent this comment. Thank u.
---
Also, do grenade launchers count?
---
I hate it already. I can't walk 2 steps without seeing someone's scope and dodging frantically behind cover or getting shot from behind
---
To real
---
Nope no bueno . You can check with ‚Äúwill it run ‚Äú program
---
Mine rolled with triple tap and demolitionist, not sure on the mw. I want to farm more.
---

---
The tribute hall is an event later in this season. You getting the triumph early is a glitch.
---
 We have deployed a fix for players experiencing Refer-a-Friend linking issues. However, veteran players must create a new link to send to new players.  
---
Additionally, we‚Äôve temporarily extended the new player window from 7 to 14 days.  
---
For more information about the Refer-a-Friend quest, please visit: [https://www.bungie.net/Referafriend](https://www.bungie.net/Referafriend)
---
Yes.  You can find it in Triumphs
---
So people like you keep spending money on engrams
---
Ahh, k cool, its not just me that has this issue.
---
Midnight Coup is still one of the highly used weapons, because outlaw and rampage are still a meta combination of perks. The problem is that you cannot mod it. 
---
There is also the factor to consider, that anything similar to midnight coup is **a lot** harder to get than simply running Leviathan this week and buying the gun from Benedict (he sells a different gun each week).
---
You can get the quest on all characters. You only need to complete the quest once for all the characters to obtain it (through collections)
---
We need this someone make this
---
Well midnight coup is always god tier, but a well rolled spare rations is better due to being a year 2 gun. If you are looking for pvp meta, yeah apparently austringer is performing pretty well but thorn and ace are still really good contenders.
---
Midnight Coup has been one of the most solid kinetic weapons since launch.
---
It's still very good, and a LOT of people have well over 50,000 kills with it.
---
All three of my characters have had MC in their inventory since early Year 1.
---
Killing myself with my own grenade: wtf is murdering me?! *blank stare* oh shit its me.
---
Joining a clan helps. That's what I did little over month ago and was able to get Leviathan and Last Wish done for first time.
---
OwO ;)
---
Mom come pick me up I‚Äôm scared
---
Oh so it‚Äôs still good ? I might get the Austringer I don‚Äôt have a raid team
---
Nice.
---
What? For how long menagerie takes I should be walking away with as many items as I can goddammit. Please don‚Äôt ‚Äúfix‚Äù Bungie.
---
Keep? They got me once. This kind of shit is very obviously anti-consumer, and I won't be doing that again.
---
If they were looking for a quick buck, they got it. But they gave up a long term investment for it, so I hope they did the math on which one was more profitable.
---
Thank you for sharing that beautiful sub
---
Ahhh goctha

you *had us* the *first half*, *I*'m not gonna lie

I live in a house with four other people all of them play on the same account

I'm gonna do what's called a pro gamer move

All we know is that they will be individually purchase-able (source: livestream). We don't know anything else yet.
---
That‚Äôs kind of you. Expect a friend request from karrumi
---
PC master race. Will add you. Thanks for being friendly guy
---
Not too sure to be fair, I think the main crunch was the boss fight itself. Those shanks are deadly
---
It was disappointing for sure, but getting the triumphs was actually super fun along the way.
---
I would also like to know plz.
---
I didn't know the scorn raiders' weak point are the lanterns :O
---
im confused by your post, so your saying bring back a raid boss but not the raid. So like bring back crota as a boss but not the raid and raid mechanic?
---
I‚Äôm 45-ish clears strong, still love it
---
great roll, till I get it I am using the same but with boxed breathing instead of quickdraw. I will probably keep the roll for super rounds. Only played 5 games with it but one shotted 15 supers
---
Nice! I haven‚Äôt used it in pvp yet but it dropped with alloy magazine, eye of the storm and feeding frenzy. So far it melts ads.
---

This Fist bro so worthy he skipped to fight Gahlran

I rather have them put it back where it was, and while they are at it, turn the shaders back aswell.
---
Instead they should have removed the whole hold button down to action.
---
Im 9/11 for dredgen
---
Lord Of Rings fans would like this also. Great job.
---
What‚Äôs the cheese?
---
No one else was invading and I think they noticed I was doing very well so I got them all to myself (lost count but it was quite a few)
---
Just say you play destiny, they can‚Äôt not be your friend just because you play a game.
---
No, he said coup, not coup. Both of you are wrong.
---
Repost smh
---
I think that matches my total invasion kills üò≠
---
Nice
---
Damn the old psions looked pretty cool. Digging the purple and blue
---
What did it cost? - Everything.
---
You‚Äôre*
---
It'll probably be back someday
---
Alright I'll give you that.
---
Thank you very much for that. Good human.
---
Sure, it's very annoying that people do that but why didn't you just grab the motes and move on with your life instead of witchhunting that guy?

Report and move on.

What‚Äôs the god roll on the Austringer? Is it a range or stability masterwork?
---
My problem with the mini tool is that I already have the recluse. I cannot see an instance where I would use the mini tool over that.
---
It's called "docking" and it's beautiful
---
Huh
---
Its a bug, they are working on fixing it now
---
Those memes are because noone uses Fighting Lion but whips it out now for farming Wendigo because of infinite ammo
---
srsly  tho.

that shit gives me anxiety

i need the template for this

Lol there‚Äôs literally a gun called [Distant Relation](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2034817450/distant-relation/), think that‚Äôs what they meant because I see it too

Destiny names are weird dude

I got my midnight coup not using a mic in Lebiathan. I believe in you!

Ohhhh huh I guess I unintentionally made a destiny rifle based off halo designsü§î

You are correct. My butt has been nerfed into the void. :-\

In the show, what was summoned that surprised him?

Yeah, and the burn helps a lot, (I‚Äôd personally recommend arbalest for anything shank)

I bet that guy feels dumb for missing with wardcliff lol

Yep
---
The new "this is fine" template

Do those keep you alive when it‚Äôs Blackout against the knights in the reckoning?

Unclear, I have a terrible feeling we will have to redownload, though. [On this page, there's a link to sign up for email updates](https://www.bungie.net/en-US/Explore/Detail/News/47882) regarding the move to steam.
---
[A variety of options are in this post or the comments!](https://old.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bzjpkr/official_lfg_megathread_v_4/)
---
PS4?
---
D2 will be leaving battle net entirely, after September the only way to play it is through steam (all PC purchases and progress will transfer). We don't know exactly how this is all going to work yet.
---
I saw an lfg post for CoS where the host wanted 20+ clears which isn't even possible yet
---
Okay that‚Äôs cool. Got it now. Thank you. :)
---
How does the Xbox transfer work though?
---
Telesto is still an awesome weapon and the sticky orbs enable the player to play around with the enviroment, for example in Gambit, I love it there (at least against the mobs, but so much against Invaders). But overall it depends on the weapon loadout and the Loaded Question is the more flexible choice as it isn't an exotic, but I think both are very viable.
---
I play on PS4 and PC and honestly I find PC easier to win games on and I‚Äôm not a great PVP player. It‚Äôs not as sweaty as people would lead you to believe. I‚Äôve also seen people using a controller on PC do very well even against mouse and keyboard. Skill is much more important than input device.
---
Telesto with Masterwork is one of the best exotics in the game. Add clearance and orb generation in PvE, teamshot deterrence in PvP. Best fusion imo
---
 And they wont let this guy be a dude
---
Understandable, I was just making a pc masterrace joke cause I‚Äôm a little bitch like that lol. On another note tho, Anthem has always sucked and will continue to suck. There are games that launch who don‚Äôt have much to offer but still have the basic frame of what a good game could be, and then they end up becoming very good in the future, like Destiny, Division, Sea of Thieves, and even No Mans Sky. Anthem on the other hand has barely anything to offer period and seems like it would take an eternity to fix, not to mention the state BioWare was in considering how many people were being overworked and some straight up left. They have a giant checklist of things to fix before the game can be considered decent, and even then they barely have enough recourses and power to make these changes. BioWare is on very thin ice and it‚Äôs a surprise they haven‚Äôt already been shut down.
---
Yea I think it works better because it blows up in your face
---
Yea... That's why I can"t beat the final boss of CoS : I need a teach
---
As fusions ,bows ,and anything that charges the lower the number the faster it fires
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs some sort of built-in prevention for that happening. I‚Äôve played enough Gambit to get the Dredgen title and anytime I get the revive started they never auto respawn unless I accidentally let go of the revive key. But I‚Äôm not 100% sure of this being a thing, just my personal experience.
---
Any help is best officiated by usage of the Mod flair. It makes your answer look more validated
---
756 the more time the slower
---
Something coming in tribute hall
---
Then use the fated engram.
---
Bungie really should change the color of the arrow that appears next to the number when changing stats around. It turns green when it goes up, even though it makes the stats worse.
---
I only have like half the titan exotics
---
N I'm sitting here wondering how tf I get past level 30 so I can stop getting 340 power gear.
---
The entire game is not going f2p, only base game, warmind and osiris
---
Yeah exactly i really wish you could report people for doing this shit. I got banned off my CLAN chat and every other clan chat until July because i put ‚ÄúDoing recluse carries 30$ per minute‚Äù obviously as a joke, i get banned for soliciting. Some nerd on lfg does it for real, they don‚Äôt get anything done to them...
---
It's the strange kind of fun that can be stupidly frustrating to use at first then incredibly fun once learnt
---
Any of the opulent armor mods.
---
You have to slot runes while in the other loaded area, iirc. And then run back and loot, repeat.
---
You can use any forge for le monarque. Bergusia is able to drop it and jotunn, however they both only drop with a powerful frame. You get two chances per character per week for it.
---
Not surprised that there's a Sub-Reddit for this actually
---
Imagine being triggered by D1 footage lmao
---
I believe there is a report button in the app. You can report it as spam. Might be yelling into the abyss though, as I'm not sure if any action  is taken
---
Yeah i tried that before nothing. And if they were to get banned they could probably just make a throwaway
---
Ornaments and shaders are different. Ornaments change the shape/model of the item, shader changes the colours. 
---
If you equip an ornament, it doesn‚Äôt change the shader, it adopt its colours. Changing the shader or will change the ornament colours, removing it put the item to the default ornaments colours.
---
If you had a nice shader on the item and overwrote it with another shader, there it no way to revert without just reapplying the old shader. All unlocked shaders are on your collections tab.
---
*entire Xbox store walks in*
---
That cabal in the background playing the guitar if you know what i mean :)
---
Wow! That must have taken aaaaaaages
---
Yeah recluse isn't bad but mountaintop is bad even for pvp players since it forces triple gl
---
Dude he's pretty bad. He's a piece of shit in the ow community.
---
That's why I chose them, because I do too
---
Into the backrooms
---
Ah cool cool thank you :)
---
what a lad
---
But here‚Äôs the thing, I‚Äôve already got Riskrunner and there‚Äôs a ton of other weapons and armor pre-annual pass that I still don‚Äôt have.
---
He‚Äôs not wrong lol. Top tree nightstalker and bottom tree golden gun are the best PvE subclasses for Hunter in endgame content, and Orpheus (even after the nerf) and celestial are still the best exotics for those subclasses. You can also throw raiden flux in the mix as the best PvE exotic for all arcstrider trees. Shards of Galanor is probably still the best exotic for middle tree Goldie (way of a thousand cuts) but it is very inconsistent and underwhelming after the nerfs it has received. 
---
That being said, there are plenty of newer Hunter exotics that you can make *fun* builds around, and it doesn‚Äôt sound like your friend is raiding so it‚Äôs not like he needs to run optimal builds. Ophidia Spathe, Liar‚Äôs Handshake, Sealed Ahamkara‚Äôs Grasps, and Young Ahamkara‚Äôs Spine are all pretty fun to run in PvE.
---
Since it‚Äôs release, last word has never not been the meta lol
---
Send invite
---
Lol! That was a good one
---
Wait, popular streamers are moving over to D2 now?
---
It pretty much works the same. Take armor you like the look of, and add the good perks and whatnot to it.
---
So you are missing world-drop armor/weapons that were added in Forsaken or earlier? That shouldn‚Äôt happen, it‚Äôs a bug if so. Do you have an example of something you‚Äôre missing?
---
I play on console and no one uses it xD.  It was all Luna's abusers.
---
Destiny base, coo and warming are included FOR FREE with forsaken. The price tag remains the same with or without them. If you already own the base game, great! You pay the same price.
---
Damn, I'm sorry that didn't help
---
Hence the part about it being pc meta.
---
There's literally already a cheese for everything in the game making it so easier players can finish what should be the hardest encounters easily without challenging themselves:
---
Mountaintop: Kill lobby
---
Outbreak: Time freeze
---
All year 1 raids: Year 2 abilities like Well
---
Riven: Cluster/Prospector
---
Scourge: Two-man run cheese
---
Crown: Emperor's Blaze
---
Menagerie: Chest glitch
---
Ah. I can't phrase for shit. Thank you for the correction
---
I'm guessing you might be new to Destiny, huh?  If not, you've been incredibly lucky to just now encounter this.
---
This has been a problem for going on 5 years now.  Sometimes it's better, sometimes it's worse, but Bungie seems to be happy with the current measures for combating it (even if many others aren't).
---
I guess so, it'll be so cool to finally see how creative people are gonna get !
---
Replying to a question is not the same as answering a question. Its funny that you mention people not wanting to face people that make them feel bad when you are the one advocating fabled (oh, i mean legend, since you changed the topic from comp to qp) players farming new players instead of playing against those with similar skill levels where they have a better chance of losing and getting better.
---
Its clear though, that despite what you said earlier, you obviously have no interest in people actually getting better. Your interest is in farming new players and making feeble attempts convincing people that getting steamrolled by fabled (oops again... Legend) players somehow will make new players better at the game.
---
I loved that gun. Had it on the PS4 ut i dont now that im on xbox. Felt like a Hazard of The Cast but better.
---
Okey, thank you, good sir. We will have to stay tuned for more info.
---
You gone be there a while
---
Ah shit here we go again
---
Pretty helpful. Thank you, mister.
---
WAKE ME UP

&gt;but i didn't finish the invitation

What does the invitation say? Does it not tell you what to do next?

Datto said he had fun and would play with them again

No. The knife. Issues with Colony?

Or constantly reviving them only to see them run around like twits not even returning the favour.
---
it‚Äôs a no skill weapon
---
Moon‚Äôs haunted
---
Not really transmog. When you first get a perk on a piece of armor, it is unlocked and you can apply it to any other armor.
---
1. Dawning Hope (cuz it just goes with everything)
---
2. Worldline Zero (cuz Worldline skating is fun as hell)
---
3. Geomag Stabilizers (cuz they're fun)
---
4. Reverie Dawn (honorable mention goes to [Iron Symmachy set + Dawning Hope](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyFashion/comments/b6k02i/hope_of_the_alliance/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app))
---
It was probably fixed with the hotfix yesterday. You weren't supposed to be able to get all the fragments at one from here.
---
This so much. 
---
the sniper kills don't even have to be in comp so people carrying it into there trying to get kills are choosing to gimp the team if they don't normally snipe.
---
Makes sense. My fault for being a lil stupid. Thanks
---
Strange that it disappeared. But I did have the same one drop in a nightfall (thats where its supposed to come from if you don't get it from Petra).
---
So the only "bug" might be that you randomly had it removed, but its supposed to drop there and since you didn't have the progress saved, it makes sense the new one was at 0.
---
Pro tip: go into the lost sector in Artifacts Edge. Bunch up the goblins and use rockets. I finished this bounty (twice, actually) using this method and I had it finished before I even got to the boss. Multi-kills give a lot of progress.
---
No skill weapon. Spoken like the truly salty. You‚Äôve been on the losing end of it a bit I see.
---
The knife is a skill weapon. I admit, this was a lucky throw though.
---
Armor 2.0 will be better than transmog. When you get a perk, you'll be able to apply it to any armor.
---
I have been on Xbox since launch. never noticed any drastic changes myself. I am guessing being away for so long you just don't accurately remember what it felt like.
---
Laughs in titan, then realizes, begins to cry in titan
---
Question about cross save. 
---
Does this mean if I buy shadowkeep for pc and let‚Äôs say Xbox, could I make a character on pc level it up, then log out and go to a different room where my Xbox is located and log into my xbox and continue from where I was?
---
And back and forth as I want?
---
Are they okay?
---
I‚Äôve noticed the slow and jagged actions too, mostly on capes.
---
Bungie content in a nutshell
---
Hitreg in this is game is bad, and that's a fact, he should've had him the first time he hit him, what are you trying to prove?
---
I understand, I do, but they never planned it to have story content and they said that before the annual pass released. These seasons are just meant to be filler until the actual continuation comes out which honestly, is a lot better than them adding nothing at all (looking at you anthem). And the shit storm about DLC existing just behind a wall was towards both HoW and Dark Below. HoW individually had the no raid shit storm.
---
You have warmind and curse as it is free to all since june 4th
---
LFG and if you're lucky you get a good team where you guys will bulldoze through it in a day. I was at 200+ and over the day I made it to 2100. A 5+ win streak helped get us there.
---
But they aren't staring at each other. The best person is staring at the other one, but the other one is looking to the right.
---
Kudos to players that use sniper rifles in pvp. That shit is ridiculous.
---
I read this in Xol's voice and was pleased.
---
Haha yes it wasn‚Äôt a full tornado, just a warning but we did have to stop raiding for a couple of hours.
---
You need all of it. It‚Äôs worth the wait though

Also did I talk to you yesterday?
---
Did their internet go out?
---
honestly you are in the minority. I used a beloved today in comp with boxed breathing and I heatshoted 15 roaming supers that just walked around the corner. As a destiny 1 vet that enjoyed the sniper meta I really enjoy the current situation after the 9 months of shotgun apes
---
Yes
---
Yes we dis talk yesterday. Here.
---
Oh cool
---
Yeah, maybe. I've got shit dl speed. It'll take up to 24 hrs tho
---

Virgins 6v1 Crota with their weapons and bad Internet.
---
Real boys 1v1 Crota Sword only.
---
TITANS 1v1 CROTA FISTS ONLY.
---
Very cool.
---
MINE IS SWEET TIO. I MADE IT MYSELF.
---
Well that is extremely unfortunate. But trust me. I‚Äôve been playing since Y1 of D1 and I‚Äôve played D2 since Beta came out. It is worth it. And the start it was pretty bad but since Forsaken things have been getting better and better. It is worth it. Even if people are bitching about things on reddit all the time. They are just upset that nerfs, which always happen at some point, happen. It just encourages people to go for different weapons and not everyone use the same thing. Anyways, I hope you enjoy Guardian!
---
True. But I can't trust anything else.  
---
I'll see myself out, and I'm sorry for that shitty pun
---
Dodge too btw. I don‚Äôt know if it actually does but it sure feels like it
---
Hahaha that‚Äôs actually pretty funny.  Trust issues lol
---
My favorite is when they do it too early and you can just hear the brain trying to reconnect
---
I‚Äôm just trynna finish my mountaintop man
---
Nice job !
---
&gt;GLs
---
I really wish they were good enough to warrant salt
---
Good thing everyone is using snipers right now lol
---
In my post on r/destinymemes I thanked and gave credit to the original author. I didn't want to do it twice and annoy him.
---
If you haven‚Äôt run into some fuckass using Luna‚Äôs and 3 grenade launchers you‚Äôre a lucky man
---
That shit is one of the most annoying things in the game
---
&gt;Luna‚Äôs and 3 grenade launchers 
---
Man‚Äôs using four guns? God damn.
---
I‚Äôm 60% for my mountaintop double kills between now and last week bro, they are horrible.
---
R e a d
---
My brain is fried, forgive me brother
---
me too but I also like to snipe. I also only manages 25% of the double kills in the last 2 seasons so there is no way I will get it in this season anyway so I will just have slme fun
---
I always have one running and I have the buff where I get 2 runes. Right now I'm farming Hush in gambit so I get some sweet sweet blue runes for the shotgun well i am at it.
---
‚Äúhow do you think we got here?‚Äù
---
hmmmmmm
---
Boo!
---
I always 420 after I 69.
---
A personal experience maybe?
---
I‚Äôve done 60% in the last week. Around 10% a day.
---
Use whatever guns you want and a good heavy GL (I use colony, it works believe me) and just play heavy like a sweat.
---
i was thinking nut
---
Np
---
Telesto is 100% better than loaded question.
---
BUT loaded question doesn‚Äôt take up an exotic slot, and is pretty close to telesto
---
Where is this?
---
This pleases the n u t
---
I‚Äôm the same way, exotic heavies are fucking amazing, but I actually like to consistently use my exotic, which you can‚Äôt do with heavies. You used to be able to with whisper but then they nerfed it

[There are a variety of places to find people in this post and its comments.](https://old.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bzjpkr/official_lfg_megathread_v_4/) The easiest raid in my opinion is Eater of Worlds, but Leviathan isn't so bad.
---
You can't buy it through battle net, but yes, it is on amazon.
