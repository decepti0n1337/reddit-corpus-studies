I love that shader on guns. The twinkle of it with the dark blue makes me oh so happy
---
---
---
Yeah I got the delux edition!
---
At first I thought this was a shiny Onix cosplay, lol
---
Wha... What was Osiris doing with his ghost???
---
[Well...](https://i.imgur.com/ThEVwu9.gif)

You really don't know how game Development works do you? Why would they put money and resources into making a new ship design instead of working on new dlc activities, weapons, and armor. This is also the reason that there have been no vender refreshes for a while
---
I’d give my right nut for No Land Beyond.
---
Lol you take this too seriously.
---
In a heartbeat !
---
Aww man do you know if it’s next week?
---
I only want Nightsalkers Tether Mark to go away so something good can be added instead. Otherwise it should be the only one with iy
---
Oh snap! I like that this is coming from a fellow Baltimorian. At least I know I'm not the only person in MD that plays D2 lol.
---
So let’s get to taking out their command one by one.
---
This ^

---
Had to log out then log back in  twice (login failed) before it would come back.
---
This is the comment I was looking for!
---
Bungie: *removes the literally strongest overshield in the game (95) that would let you tank supers*
---
U:PackTang: the overshield never really did much
---
What is this grammar?!
---
No step
---
I got them, thank you.
---
Not really I always managed to kill them even if they did have a shield
---
Its decent for primeval damage, but i save mine usually strictly for guardians, but i also only use it when I have a bounty for killing guardians. I run mountaintop, recluse with it, and use the nighthawk for my armor
---
More details, please.
---
Hell to the YES!
---
Only thing i can think is you are full on quest/bounties so it may have went to the postmaster
---
Im not sure if they do increased glory, increased valor is usually during iron banner
---
That’s a smart load out, I haven’t used mine in awhile. Does mountaintop+recluse+truth offer decent dps compared to izanagi, recluse, wendigo? That’s what I’m running currently as I have yet to finish this truth quest
---
almost half the price is not a few dollars for everyone. its 2019 you should be pissed paying full price a month earlier( bad precedent to set for games). suppose you like the new eververse too?
---
You can do a lot of damage with a mt and recluse or using the loaded question. So you don’t have to use a exotic heavy or even use a heavy to do damage. Then using oppressive darkness will make you do a lot more damage and using your super. Some people also just focus on invading and killing invaders
---
Butthurt titans, butthurt Titans everywhere
---
You  can, but apparently expansions bought on one platform don’t carry over to the other.
---
What do you think about reducing the tracking duration or maybe the ability to see through walls?
---
I'm a snitch. Totally screwed.
---
Uhhh...... Ummmm...... my word fail me so now I mist punch.
---
*laughs in warlock*
---
I was having the same problem, I just deleted the app and reinstalled lol
---
I want to have a destiny version of red vs blue. It'll take place at a random outpost in the middle of the EDZ. They don't know why but they keep coming back from the dead. They have their own dumb crucible. And then one day they find a shank......that talks.
---
You can use whisper does great damage still or prospector, wendigo or some GL with spike grenades. I'd run ward of dawn with helm of saint 14 to help deal with ads and damage buff. What are you on, ps4/Xbox/PC? If your on ps4 I'd be down to run
---
Yes. I may be mistaken, but I believe you can still get it if you don’t have the expansion. It drops from Heroic Menagerie.
---
Have you seen the Thorium Holt Hood? *shudders*
---
Taniks bows to no kell...
---
I'd use it a ton
---
***if I had it***
---
:sad weeping:
---
I was taking none of this seriously until I felt the need to defend myself over a difference of opinion. I hate arguing over trivial bullshit.
---
This is the plot of xcom lmao
---
I'll try ward of dawn titan, thanks for the feedback! I'm on pc sadly:(
---
I should’ve waited tbh, but the moon was haunted and I already wasted 85 dollars for the deluxe edition along with forsaken which is more than I already paid for the base game when it first came out on console right when it first came out.
---
I would, but it doesn’t affect supers. But if you go high discipline and strength, you could play them off each other to get them sooner. 
---
Throw in some mods the help them come back faster, you’ve got a a good if not great utility build for a titan.
---
I would love a solo/fireteam only instancing option
---
Want to do EP? Set to fireteam only and the ENTIRE time I'm on mars I'll never see another person unless they're on my team. Would be so great
---
When Winnie the Pooh had enough
---
Ah well no worries good luck with the dungeon man and happy to help
---
Titan or IO and talk to the NPC there, there should be a quest
---
Any Legendary armor pieces drop during this season (from crucible, IB, vanguard, gambit, planetary activities) can apply any universal ornaments. Not the old ones from your vault. 
---
When you preview a piece of armor, press down and ornaments slot is next to shaders.
---
Use sentinel middle tree to help with adds and health regen.
---
But is this weeks TWAB *nasty*?
---
Sword gang tho
---
Honestly I feel this like I just wish we hit normal dmg numbers I feel so week seeing a lowly 22 pop up even tho ik I'm doing normal dmg
---
Correct. You can tell by looking to see if a gun has a catalyst slot.
---
Impossible!
---
I used fighting lion and a 110rpm Duke with rampage so I could clean up with Duke and 2 tap. It makes things go way faster
---
Why?
---
*hey kid, want some key blades?*

Is it just me or do the "precusor Vex" models look more high-tech and complete / advanced than the current vex? Or is that by design? And how do you keep track of who came first when your entire population is running around all of time anyway
---
Lost sector and region chests are explained in red war campaign, immediately upon going to the edz
---
He sells it occasionally, just like any other mod. That's how I got mine.
---
I like being able to kill the final boss. It's a good challenge.
---
Did they make them drop with the new number of mod slots and everything? I just assumed theyd be poopoo drops
---
and then you might be playing The Secret World
---
What do you mean curve stomp an entire litter of kittens to get bad juju
---
Freehand grip is a mod you can add. It’s worth it
---
Nah it is just commom for that much people to leave. The game just launched as f2p so many people came just moved by the curiosity. 
---
Also did you check the [homepage?](https://steamcharts.com/) Destiny is 4th place in players number, I guess it will take a while for it to go down. You might think it is empty because they limit the numbers of players per map.
---
I got it last week and I actually dislike it. Vigilance Wing/Ace has seemed to work for me.
---
D2 feels strangely subjective.
---
whose name i'm pretty sure is a dev troll
---
When you want to hit legend, you will have the worst luck.. trust me...
---
If you dont win a game in 5+ hours i dont think the MM is the problem to be honest
---
There is no festival of the lost engram.
---
Spoilers
---
It's not a nerf at all if you hit only crits. Boosted critical damage stays the same, boosted bodyshot damage will now be based on normal bodyshot damage and not critical damage.
---
Current boost: +21% damage on crits and +98% on bodyshots
---
Nerfed boost: +21% damage on both crits and bodyshots
---
sPOilErs, it’s been over a year
---
I gather that, and even then that reason would be a logical reason as to why people redo the Alter of Sorrows boss. But in this case there is literally no reason to do again and again, specially when you're wasting all your supers on the last boss (so the excuse of "farming nightmares" clearly doesn't apply here, since if it was the case they would be using all their supers on the actual nightmares instead of the final boss).
---

i love the view of jupiter from IO, one of my favorite planets to just geek out on my astrology interests
---
Console can still opt in to voice chat.
---
Its just you have a staggering percentage of people that are toxic in some way or another and people don't want to communicate. Voice and text chat in games has ruined the desire for communication due to the toxicity from people.
---
Yeah it took me about a week to finish everything up in total, but I don’t have to go back to that bad man no more
---
I fell like only have the titan symbol would have been better
---
I don't think it was because of this. I believe that it is almost the end of the season and the DLC is linked to it.
---
 Also I believe that they expected this drop since many people just came to feel the game if it was to their taste.
---
Is destiny 3 a confirmed thing?
---
Thanks!
---
Get last word kind guardian, and thats all from me
---
Go the clans menu then click on clan banner and on the bottom should be a leave clan option
---
I did everything to complete that quest a year ago and have never received the gun. Don't get your hopes up
---
Travelling to tower
---
So you pay someone and give them your account info and they play it for you?
---
Mountaintop is still my go to kinetic weapon till today, i have the izanagi and its catalyst but i am just not comfortable when it comes to snipers
---
Wendigo get it?
---
Did you hear Asher or Red?
---
Sigh. I click on clan and it just brings up the clan chat
---
For the damage part, the amount of health someone has to have to get an increase is so low theyre literally already one shot from any gun in the game from any range thats not a shotgun trying to literally cross map somebody. Foetracer is nothing to be compared to OEM. Foetracers tracking basically disappears like right after they leave LoS. Honestly, i think foetracer needs a buff if anything.
---
[PC] Hey I've been playing for a month and a half, and I'm already 950(+10 by the artefact) if someone wants to do activities, nightfalls or other things, I'm free! here's my steam friend code: 79054661(yes those are a thing now)
---
((Also I speak Spanish, so bear with me if my English fails while chatting)) have a nice day everyone!
---
They should really put in the game “for more info visit r/destiny2”
---
Seems a bit forward asking a stranger about their vex life.
---
The burn from the primeval knights annoys me to no end
---
Yeah from experience you need to shoot someone until they lose shields to have it track through walls and even at that it lasts for about 3-4 seconds
---
Yeah, I think I was unlucky and got one armor set that I already have, but I really wish it was a unique reward rather than a repeat of something I already have, even if it has a different element and is pinnacle.
---
I was actually going to comment, " I heard Asher's voice while reading this."
---
There's literally nothing you can do to boost your chances of getting it to drop unfortunately. It is all down to RNG so just gotta keep turning em in. :(
---
More or less. This game can't expand forever

It's just some kind of "wall painting", dunno how else to describe it

Me: a hunter main

Realizes that titan only know "punwch" so I atleast have that going for me

No u no u
---
Finish your ace catalyst you monster.
---
So in shadowkeep bungie updated armor to armor 2.0. it removed all perks in favor of a customizable mod system so that you can further customize your character and create builds. Any armor you earn after shadowkeep comes as armor 2.0.
---
since i’m poor and unlucky, here’s an impromptu gold 🏅

You need 3 out of 4 keys to progress further. Volundr, Izanagi, Gofannon

The quest will tell you when to do Bergussia later

---
Thanks I just bought the Mountaintop print
---
Destiny overall is one of the most visually appealing games I’ve ever played. Bungie has done one hell of a job making every area feel unique. Sometimes I forget that we have 9 whole individual areas we get to explore and thinking about all the work the design team has had to do is mind blowing.
---
Is that a gun in game? Looks like a bolt action rifle....i need it.
---
Its only a nerf if youre a giant pussy. So its literally a nerf to all titans.
---
Keyblade
---
Exotic Sword
---
Allows you to bypass locks without having to wait for your Ghost to open them. Cannot be equipped while using a Void subclass.
---
I love how the titan kinda looks like Dio
---
Additional enemies, minor annoyances that swarm you in boss fights, and things you didn't mean to pull have been called "adds" for like well over a decade, mostly in MMOs. Trust me, don't get spelling tips from YouTubers.
---
True. I really hope they don’t nerf it because it’s so much fun to use.
---
Welcome we've been expecting u
---
CHOCOLATE
---
...well, as long as we're going there, wouldn't that be ADS?
---
I can also call them Munchkins and life will go on, but that doesn't mean it's accurate
---
Buying on Epic supports publishers and shareholders, not developers.
---
i just switch to a shorty myself and call it a day. that’s the best you can do there. 
---
HOWEVER NO ONE IN THE COMMENTS IS TALKING ABOUT THE SKILLLESS FUCKTARDS WHO SLIDE INTO YOU TO KILL YOU BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN AIM DOWN. FUCKTARDS UNITE I GUESS
---
I've been using some Mountaintop in Momentum Control and I even find it difficult there to get kills with it. Don't you need pinpoint accuracy with that thing to get a kill with it?
---
I somehow managed to solo that strike after 4 rage quits. Most rewarding feeling ever
---
Right, and most abbreviations or contractions I've ever seen will always use a doubled consonant if one is present. Reason being, the double-D (ahem) is a single sound, so it's weird to cut it in half and leave it behind, so to speak. You don't really say Ad Ditional with two distinct D sounds; Add is a single sound; therefore that's the common contraction. I mean there's really no need to try to reinvent it, the term has been around far longer than this game :). QED and have some tea
---
Had to edit it a few times but now its ok.
---
Why would you use Thunder Coil if it oneshots anyway?
---
Imagine complaining about getting banned from a server for breaking the rules you had to agree to to use the server.
---
And I'm turning left.
---
That would be the titan middle tree arc subclass, The code of the missle. The melee attack is a ironman like landing ground stomp AOE damage but wont kill anyone unless a direct hit, enough to kill adds though. But the super, is amazingly fun you really launched yourself like a missle, flew quite a distance and a massive AOE damage upon landing. It is a very unique super in the game. But i rarely use it unless i really just want to mess with it xD.
---
I play Gambit and Crucible for bounties and quests only. Not wins.
---
Sure, just buff Eriana's Vow so it's a one hit head shot and I'll be fine with only two rounds 😊
---
Xur, agent of the thirteen
---
Killing bosses and minibosses
---
Been doing different frames since I posted that answer and everyone counted
---
Finally got it, already masterworked with 1000+ kills!
---
Yeah, like how Trace rifles only get 2 shots, cause we shouldn't balance the ammo economy around how much ammo it takes to kill someone.
---
Have you actually read Liars Handshake perk?
---
Skullfort will instant recharge your shoulder charge after getting a kill with it.
---
Coldheart was rewarded if you preordered vanilla D2.
---
maybe if either of you had no standards :o
---
You Tried Prestige Spire of Stars Final Encounter?
---
Maybe next seasons engram 👀
---
I will happily use super to clear 3+ of these. They make dps phase impossible
---
Gonna add you as soon as I've started my pc
---
Not true last time Xur sold oem was August 2nd. That was 15 weeks ago.
---
Ive been fucking with crooked fang in the haunted forest, my buddy brought his shiny new divinity turning bosses into 1 big critical hot box, i can make every shot count as a crit and bosses go down before im even out of ammo!
---
I guess anything is possible. I have no idea how one would game the site.
---
Too bad you can only get common rarity items from it, and not even those are around at the start now.
---
*I brought you gifts from The Five.*

Could’ve done better with any shotgun

It's hard, like really hard. Try the destiny companion app

Try nightfall on highest light level with you being 950

Yo man. You play on steam? I saw ur from br, i’m trying to solve this cabbage error. I’m on the right way. I don’t believe there isn’t a fix for common routers and looks like it’s working.

Cheers. That's my go to fireteam place. Maybe not. I've not started but I'm already having flashbacks to the ordeal version a couple weeks ago. Jesus. The ogres. Never again, Shrek. Never again.

---
Got it! He’s in a Subway in....what country?
---
Momentum control 1 shots aren’t accurate of its true power. It’s not awful but there are plenty of better exotic bows that can do far more with better perks in regular modes even. This is coming from a person who really likes the wish ender
---
Do Season Pass items' power levels cap at some point or should I claim them as late as possible?
---
It’s amazing when the perk is activated however it has a lot of downsides, I mean why does the perk progress reset when I change weapons..
---
You literally get unlimited shoulder charges. It should give half your energy back instead of a full insta-kill
---
Even with the nerf it’s still fucking awesome. I as well loved solo queue. Congrats. Next up...lunas
---
Good.
---
# Now do it on Heroic.
---
Background material
---
Do you have a quest to open it and the dlc?
---
It's close, but when strikes had burn instead of singe (I believe it was 200% damage instead of 30%), Zhalo being in kinetic slot was king. Small arms and arc burn? You could just delete everything you encountered.
---
I just use the tribute hall to try new gear
---
Yes I do, its called basic sniper rifle frame.
---
I just got my first exotic weapon som is “bad juju”. Does my weapon damage be increase when I do arc damage or when I got arc damage from enemy?
---
“Always will” must be new here
---
The frame will have the place you need to kill the boss, you sure that’s the right place?
---
You gotta do it on nessus for the sniper
---
Reminds me of that old [Battlefield jet swap](https://youtu.be/LrOIgxQ--Tc?t=7) in that the reply shows you were using the force or something to find that hitbox.  Amazing shot!
---
Unbroken will be a meme next two seasons because of how easy comp is
---
It did in Y1
---
So what?
---
Who is the artist for this image?
---
If y'all need help and play on PC I'd gladly play comp.
---
That was magnetism and P2P
---
Just checked on braytech and I do indeed have the nade launcher. The problem I see now is I don’t have anything to do arc damage. Should I just leave that up to my teammates? Also now since I have an exotic slot open in my kinetic, what do you recommend? I was maybe thinking about using outbreak, bad juju or maybe a even sweet business. What do you think?
---
I think you're looking for the /r/trees subreddit

Your at the wrong box

More like organization 5, those guys don't play around

Looks great!  Can't wait to see it finished

If you slow it way down you can see that the reticle was actually on his head when he fired. More like /r/hitboxporn imo

The next closest thing would probably be if you have a hallowfire heart and 100 strength and sit at full super energy.
---
Find a good clan, preferably peeps who don’t treat you like garbage
---
But you have to do parcour to get there
---
I lie and tell them I'm gay when they bother me going in to or out of a store just to see their faces.
---
I used to think I might be indirectly hurting the gay community by doing this until one of them told me "Then you should give extra for your sins."
---
Yeah it's pretty clear that it's done on purpose, there's only one word that vaguely implies it's not free. I guess people just get agressive when you criticise something in their game 🤷‍♀️
---
Gotcha
---
Thanks man I’m currently Mystic II went on a 5 win streak with my buddy now onto Mystic 3 and Legend. So thanks
---
Log out and back in. Should fix it
---
Uuhh.. aim for the head?
---
If you have th me win portion done well just go to orbit and go back to the tower or change characters
---
Maybe austringer?
---
ok will do thanks

Well on that note you probably activated your luck for a good while 🍺

Nothing else I guess. Good luck in the battle field new light. Welcome to the Last City

I have rampage, 4th times a charm, light mag, extended barrel and a range MW. Not the best roll but as long as you are hitting those crits and activating rampage especially with a rampage spec it’s basically unstoppable lol.
---
You’re playing momentum and only got two kills, what’s so great about that?
---
Guess you could say you SmackedHisBuns.
---
thank you
---
Try to complete exotic quests when you get the chance. Also good to look for a beginner friendly clan.

Let the grind begin then
---
Aeon + rat king  FTW
---
Aw yiss. Ya boy got all those and just finished up Hush yesterday. Last but not least, Breakneck. Nice to see a felow gambit lover.
---
I suppose. But personally I've done the mission so many times I can make it to that spot with 15 minutes still on the clock.
---
alright thanks
---
Mfw I finished solar killsfor Luna's, about to leave the match and double check to see that I need 💯 more kills.
---
Hunters! asseble
---
Me neither, just google some walkthroughs and do the easier ones. I found Thorn to be pretty easy, it just takes a while.
---
It gives extra super energy on melee kills
---
Ty
---
Use all void weapons and a void subclass. When iron banner comes back in play that. It gives extra progress.

im just mining dusklight

Lets go to prison!

If you have the season pass, you can unlock boosters. With these, one match Equals one percent

YES I AM
---
Dont tell him you saw this you will ruin his rep
---
No it depends on the speed of the projectile. The titan wasnt really moving much.
---
The speed of sound is 1100fps. Falling just above or below that arbitrary point wont change anything.
---
But hitting a moving target with a round going 4000fps is much easier than one going 800fps
---
Or the D.F.A.
---
50 Gambit Prime matches. That's as fast as you'll get.
---
Yea that’s what you must do. It used to be worse to make an alt, this time you can get powerlevel jump really fast
---
Get truth. Absolute monster in combat, and people call you a degenerate for using it—that’s how powerful it is.
---
Just went there with Edgewise five minutes ago lol
---
I was doing strikes lol thanks guardian much appreciated
---
You’re gonna have a good time. Put on Monte Carlo if you have it, more melee charges.
---
That’s amazing, Cayde is one of my favorite characters in destiny
---
Doing it like Cayde
---
we found it thanks guys!
---
Damn son
---
Oh okay yeah I'm at 85 with the season pass I think I'm gonna give some gambit prime a go lol thanks
---
of course of course ill keep this secret even while im dead
---
I rewatch and still not seeing it. And I can make that as I have been on the other end of cheaters. I have seen way to many aimbots wall hacks and more. Also I am staying my opinion something I am allowed to do. I do not believe he has the skill as the spin was way to quick and accurate
---
The legend himself
---
Yeah why isn't there a firing range in the tower? Could have a mini game or achievement related to certain amount of bulls eyes or something like duckhunt
---
Heavy Finisher must be unlocked on your artifact AND equipped on your Class Item as a Mod.
---
Amanda Holliday in the hanger area of the tower will give you the campaign missions, so after finishing whatever initial quests the game gives you, go visit her, let her feel relevant again
---
That's NASTY
---
Would this work with thundercoil?
---
I managed to get two points for:
---
Forging a BA sniper rifle frame (no point) and then getting that same frame out using ballistics log, and forging that. (one point). Then I grabbed a BA sword frame and forged it, (one point), and repeated the sword frame using ballistics logs (no point)
---
Widows Walk lost sector in the EDZ
---
Possibly? I don’t have the mod, so I couldn’t tell you.
---
Ive done it as a guide a few times, it works pretty good that way. I hear seeking is a pain in the ass
---
That sword is a thing known as Black Talon. Swing it to send out a tracking projectile at enemies.
---
That's fair lol
---
Right. What I'm saying is this is a matter of Hitscan vs. Realistic views, not how the game "actually" works. I was pointing out that people think it's Hitbox Gore because of realistic views, where there are things like Bullet Travel, but it isn't because it's hitscan.
---
Me with Gambit when I finished exit strategy last night.
---
Unfortunately the catalyst sucks a lot. It increases by the smallest amount the dragonfly effect's damage. Catalyst good for orbs though
---
The drum always spins. If you plug in a controller or if you're playing on a console, when you slowly squeeze the right trigger but not all the way so it shoots, the hammer of the gun pulls back and the drum spins to feed the next bullet.
---
No no, that still has travel time. Make it hitscan.
---
In momentum it's nearly always and by that I mean always a one shot headshot.
---
I’m not sure. But after you complete the campaign you may be able to go back to Amanda and pick up the campaign quest again.
---
Skele-ghaul was it?
---
Yep that's the worst. Idk how many times this week I haven't gotten that first barrier hob
---
From a creative standpoint, that strike is one of my faves. It was very unique fighting it out in the dark.
---
Your teacher better give you an A+ for that. 
---
Do I have your permission to use that as my screen saver
---
Please do
---
Hunters are pussies
---
At launch when I played my Titan through the Red War campaign to the max of what was then level 20, I used this build the entire playthrough and tried my best to do a speed run doing so. Lots of fun. D2Y1 might have been stale but that was some good times
---
Look I'm not defending it but at least you have to land a headshot. 
---
Meanwhile: ShOoT GroUnD wIN GaME exists within momentum.
---
Do another match or log out and log back in
---
As a fellow yeet titan I feel offended by this xd
---
Well, that may not have the traditional body of a revolver, but mechanically it still acts, functions and is animated like a revolver
---
Sturm is special. Sturm and Drang are named for a German literary movement, so they made Sturm look like the German Mauser pistol and Drang looks like the Luger.
---
What a gamer!
---
What an asshole thing to do to post this along with his name
---
Had that happening to me, logging out and back in fixed it, so maybe try that if you haven’t already?
---
Yeah. Apparently it’s down for some reason. Don’t know why
---
Yeah I've been getting that too. No idea why
---
Wow! That’s awesome!
---
He’s not cheating lol the mark is there at 7 seconds bottom of the circle, turns to the top of the circle when he turns around then disappears
---
What?
---
I really wish this was real
---
I managed to get a Hammer forged/Tac Mag/Fourth times the charm/Firing line with a reload masterwork and it's absolutely nuts.
---
These chests don't contain the raid gear sadly. Just exotics and year 1 world gear.
---
I like it on hand cannons but that’s a personal preference
---
This is very deep!!
---
That's no life right there
---
I've had a time where I was getting orbs on one of the lower platforms, and the blueberry up top left early on in a round without my noticing. I and the third player chuck maybe thirty orbs total up there only to notice that they're sitting around and we have 5 seconds left in the round ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
MK. 44 Stand Asides already does that. It gives you back half of your shoulder charge on hit.
---
I’d look for feeding frenzy kill clip for PVP or feeding frenzy rampage for PVE
---
Needless to say hitscan can and will sometimes feel "off" especially in peer to peer connections in pvp scenarios. Wich in case you didn't know ARE an issue. I'm usually the side that benefits from it but i have hit shots on people that were behind cover because they weren't yet behind it on my screen. Their implementation of hitscan then sends a registered hit to the server causing them to get hit behind cover. Now i know this is a combination of several issues with peer to peer connections being the bigger issue. Hitscan is generally not as good as an actual projectile in pvp scenarios. And it doesn't even need bullet drop to make it feel better. Gunplay in destiny aren't good because of hitscan it is because of several other factors such as sound and gun handling.
---
Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game?
---
Definitely not the best but yeah I don’t think it’s on the list of things for the devs to change
---
I mean the armor set was good looking, but D2 in terms of activities and GAMEPLAY is far superior.
---
We're vall in it to have fun. We all want to do the same things and helping others with the experience is just as much fun the second or third times around.
---
If that was in d2 I would use that just for its look
---
Got sunshot within 45 mins
---
Same with mars, tbh. I’d much rather have then recycle Mars from D1 than use the area that they have now
---
Not in my opinion armour and activity was way more fun for me you have trials and better raids
---
Meanwhile I got 4 Vigilance Wings in a row...
---
I forgot all about fighting lion. I've been using orwing and edge transit. I need to do the catalyst so 2 birbs one cowabunga. Thanks bud.
---
every week, no. all the content for this season is already in the game they just need to flip a switch to unlock it. but I ask you when they patch find a bug for something how long does it take to patch it?
---
I used to run ye old iron symachy grips and the legs with vanguard dare cloak and the raiden flux chest price with the ornament l, middle tree Arcstrider, with curated threat level, riskrunner and quickfang. However after 2.0 I'm kinda in flux
---
My team always wanders off I end up going against sweats as well 😢

Your Trials have a cool egyptian-theme going on with them
---
You get a expansion dedicated to you
---
Your expansion armor isn't the cool egyptain armor, and is instead replaced by whatever-the-fuck that kind of armor is supposed to be
---
Also, your Trials get hijacked by space tentacle people, and then they get cancelled ad infinitum

Ur a veteran when u played from the beta.dont care what anyone say about "u need to do this challenge or that thing..." no.ur a veteran when u played eversince the beta.
---
This is actually the third time that OEM is going to get nerfed. 
---
Im expecting a fourth time.
---
It was in the primary slot and therefore used primary ammo, which enabled it it to have way more shots (and after every respawn), so it circumvented any restrictions other snipers had based on the special ammo economy. Also it was an ironsight sniper, which isn't in itself better than a scope, but gives the player more vision while aiming.
---
The best of trials of Osiris was the emblem that was black and blue. Sometimes i played only to help people to Reach the lighthouse for first time. Miss that times
---
No problem! I know it’s a pain to have to replay it, that happened to me with Forsaken :(
---
Only the spicyness of that last crayon

I wiped like 50x trying to match the rotating elements, then I was like wtf am I doing? Tried the waiting for solar technique and got her in two tries.

top ten questions that science can't answer
---
Infuse at 950 or just ignore the higher gear for now 3 light/power difference isnt important
---
Not all exotics are automatically great just bc they are exotics (just look at the aeon series). I’d say just use whatever you like best. If you prefer crimson, just have the other hc on you so you can get higher light leve drops. If you like hc, the better devils, service revolver, and the austringer are some of my favorites
---
Sounds like a decent loadout. Getting killed by truth?:p
---
Man I gotta do this with gun slinger
---
Ah, it's a little bit of a joke. One of the more common "power catalyst zones" is the Shuro Chi encounter: Hunters (or parties with a Hunter) will drop a top-tree Tether, and then you go to town with the weapon-to-be-catalyzed. The tether shares the kill for all the thralls for your weapon, so it goes *quite* fast.
---
Pro strat then
---
Yeah I absolutely love her voice. 
---
Her “that’s why people talk” joke on the garden strike makes me die laughing every time
---
You will find another 908 in no time. Just wait, it really doesn't matter before you reach 950
---
Yeah but the problem is the super doesn't actually do anything. The damage is abysmal so I could have infinite of them and I'd still get out-damaged by basic guns, or a shoulder charge with peregrine greaves and high strength
---
I did iron banner but do MC I got most from it as well
---
I think Colds give more percent than others. Like 1% per medal??
---
Not really, that’s just how you see it
---
That and most of us dont really complain also bcuz well titans are the most chill about things (at least in my experience) its usually the hunter who:
---
- leaves the raid group cuz we couldnt 1 phase a boss
---
- leaves the comp team cuz "we suck" (which btw we found a warlock afterwards and got to fabled that night) 
---
- curses u out if u join the LFG group and dont have a certain exotic (even tho the post didnt specify to have that exotic) 
---
- complain about shit being op 
---
So yea.. but that's just my experiences, urs may vary
---
I fall him voice.
---
Fusion rifles are one hit kills and since you get 2 shots you get the cold fusion medal which only requires 2 kills. Recluse can also be hard to get submachinist
---

Hell yeah

If you post stuff like that on twitter, whats your username so I can follow ya
---
Now that's a bit I didn't know, my tether sharing kills. I knew it shared damage among enemies, but didn't realize it attributed them to the weapon itself. Does it share them being precision, or only the kills themselves, to the weapon?
---
I feel that Titans pain.
---
My point being is they seem to be focusing on perpetuating the destiny 2 world. A lot of game companies are adopting this strategy. I asked you for links backing up your claim about a destiny 3 and you didn’t provide any because you can’t. They had plans before when activision had their hands in it but according to game director Luke Smith and Destiny general manager Mark Noseworthy “want to stick to Destiny 2 for the forseeable future.” And IF there’s ever a destiny 3, it won’t be for a long time. I for one am glad they are expanding on this one universe as apposed to segmenting different story lines by releasing new games.
---
Idk can you
---
Don’t bother infusing / powering up items before you reach 950, as powerful gear will just drop higher anyway
---
Loved the Osiris Armor!
---
Alrigjt thanks!
---
Had you completed all story missions first? I’ve only unlocked the Lectern and searched chests for hours and hours with no drop. Starting to think maybe I need to do the whole story first?
---
Honestly, yes the game is playable without buying anything. You can have a really fun time just doing the base campaigns and strikes, etc. I really liked Warmind and Curse of Osiris. However, the expansions are also really really fun! If you end up really enjoying the game, I’d suggest asking for the expansions for Christmas. I’m pretty sure Shadowkeep comes bundled with Forsaken? Or you can get a deluxe version? Something like that. Also, if you play on Steam, Shadowkeep is 40% off right now (only $21!) so now would be a good time to beg your parents for it! Hope this helped :D
---
Had you listened to the ghost&amp;echoes version? Top tier voice acting 10X more immersive
---
Ill remember that thanks!!
---
Alright but afterwards should i upgrade my stuff?
---
You start up Last Wish Raid.... and the guy who ran it for the first time gets 1k voices. You will get Essence of Envy automatically.
---
Going for NF is even worse. 1400 glory to go and 0 sanity left
---
As soon as i reach it tho i should start upgrading what i like right?
---
Yeah, Vigilance Wing is pretty good, surprisingly not really better than a good bygones, but good.
---
I had that issue yesterday. I restarted my xbox, router, and modem.
---
Your first mission? Shouldn't be matchmade as far as I can remember.
---
If you already did it then the heroic version is available on the earth directory
---
Try restarting your whole console. If that doesn’t work, try to power cycle your console. If THAT doesn’t work... hate to say it but you might need to uninstall and reinstall the fame.
---
I knew the AI sounded familiar
---
or in terms of Destiny (what i think he/she/it means), it has only begun
---
Haha o no someone got there feel goods hurt?
---
He rockin that prodigal helm I see
---
Nah just someone is a pathological liar
---
Same here. I only played that gamemode to get Randy's.
---
🎶The Circle of Liiiife🎶
---
Yep...ty for the correction aiming of the game, if you watch the video slowly, you’ll see you’re not even touching him with your shot...
---
Thanks !
---
chills man. this is fucking cool.

People cried in this scene?
---
*Architects down*
---
Well done. *Applause*
---
Yes but Zen moment helps the stability of a gun. The more stablized the gun, the more straight the shot. It makes the gun a lot easier to work with, and you'll hit more shots more likely
---
I play with Last Word and Not Forgotten as my main loadout in Crucible. Incredibly fun, tbh. Especially with Dragon’s Shadow maxing out their handling :]
---
Bounties are not a matter of life and death, but if you think you can complete them then take them. Bounties reward faction materials and other stuff which you can use to trade in for some extra goodies. For example you gain mod components from Gunsmith bounties, which you can use to buy modifications with (Ada has some use for them too, iirc). Weekly bounties have better rewards but also take longer to do and can only be done once per week. Gunsmith's weeklies give upgrade components, which you can use to infuse higher power level gear into lower power level gear to increase its power level. Handy for keeping Exotics relevant.
---
Do enough bounties for each vendor marked with light blue on the map to get powerful gear from them each week. Powerful gear increases your power level nicely, and is also required to go beyond 900 and reach 950 (after which you need Pinnacle gear instead)
---
my fav take on it was "Epstein Didn't Misadventure."
---
&gt; I'm just a simple shoulder charge Titan
---
&gt; I have skill
---
Sure, mate
---
Lol I only use my titan when it's extremely low light
---
I got a full choke, extended mag, QuickDraw, 1-2 punch One Small Step from the moon nightmare hunts, it’s the best gun for this combo imo. But I also have a full choke, assault mag, feeding frenzy, 1-2 punch prophet of doom from the raid and of course the og reckoning last man standing. The last of which definitely took the longest to farm. The last man standing is nice against the solar shields in the nightmare hunts.
---
A solid 1000/10
---
If u dont get an A or some recognition for this, then we will be putting OEMs on and raiding ur damn school

That's a long time, I havent tried master difficulty myself. Better chance of strike specific loot is a good idea for that for sure. Good job getting that done though

Either as rewards from Crucible or from giving Shaxx Crucible Tokens. The boots and bond also belong to the same set. The gloves also look great, but the helm looks just plain stupid in that set.

That’s great news! I had read that the nerf was already in effect
---
That’s awesome! I had read that it had already been nerfed.
---
Bet your life savings on Red 32
---
Not according to VOLUSPA
---
I would definitely recommend getting thorn. It's a very nice PVP weapon and it's decent in PVE.
---
I wish Thundercrash did this kind of damage
---
Thanks! It was a fun and funny experience overall, but now idk if ill attempt another one since i completed the Undying Badge by getting the ship l. At least jot until im a higher level. I was only 962 at the time of completion
---
You looking fresh as hell
---
One sentence. I laughed.
---
It will seem endless but if you are gonna use it in pvp it will be worth. If you want to make it easier go in the momentum gamemode. Either use a void handcannon or use the duke handcannon since it one shots at mid range in that gamemode.
---
Is it "kill with long shlong" or "Xol with long shlong"?
---
Are those a50s? How you liking them?
---
It’s really nice. While I’m no professional artist, so you can take this with a grain of salt, I’d say a little more depth given to some parts would improve it.
---
Drop it on the floor and he'll rest in pieces SHAZOW
---
Only so many witches can be hunted at one time. Jotun and Erentil are probably next. MT still has a little time left. Not enough people get killed by it yet.
---
Bruh, thanks for answering.
---
I don't care if he slams into 3 enemies all game, if he's going to run off a base he could've easily captured like that, he can GTFO my team.
---
You just got to find your niche like in other shooters, do you rush or stay back for support? Do you have better control over an auto rifle or hand cannon? Etc. And remember you're going to be killed in crucible it's just going to happen there will always be a better player than you dont get discouraged. You really just have to test yourself in the crucible as shaxx would say
---

I dont have the season pass

IKR? Bows slay out in comp if you can hit with them.

Thanks

Agreed
---
question from someone who still doesnt get the game that well is truth or spare rations better
---
Saint 14 has also been cast
---
If you got the colony go to momentum control heavy ammo spawns rapidly but be aware nothing but scouts so you can’t rush or your gonna get dropped rq I’m sitting at 93% double kills then I get my mountaintop in just 2 days of grinding
---
I don't do day 1 raids every time. I've always enjoyed watching day 1 races. sometimes I attempt day 1 afterwards, or at least welcome another underleveled raid experience because that is soooooo much fun. also would rather lfg raids. I kind of play destiny differently from others and I find a lot of the raid reporters, like yourself toxic. RR tags are meaningless and even the top destiny players mimic the same thought. there's a few people I'd run low man's with. they are positive and chill and won't rage over failure like you do. but I'd honestly rather do solo challenges and help people out on lfg because I'm nice and care about the destiny community unlike you. please stop caring about raid report, it really is a bad indicator of skill. almost all of your low man's were in the mindless auto reload to dps while being overleveled. go run them back post Shadowkeep since your raid report displays so much skill
---
I cackled a bit because I thought the thing to the right was Ikora with a super long neck, I had to have a double take
---
TIL she's also Light Hope in She-Ra :D

I want to say A, but my (mostly justified) fear is that once they pick it up they’ll immediately run through the portal before they bank.

---
Thanks op! Just seeing this now, but I've been freaking out over not getting a bounty over the last week and a half of doing bounties every day.
---
I Love to run out and slide making snipers waste ammo in comp. I get hit about 15% of the time and killed about 2% or so. (Obviously those are a guess.)
---
It's worth it imo especially at that price wouldn't bother with this season 0ass when there's only 3 weeks left though unless you play the hell out of it
---
I don’t know man, but I guess I gotta give it to guardian b. Taken captains are wayyyyy more annoying than knights.

I'm not very potent with names and lore. How many knights and stuff are there? I didn't really realize there were so many honestly.

It is amazing! I can see if it was like bungie employees and they sent you the gun, but they’re just doing wat u can do.
