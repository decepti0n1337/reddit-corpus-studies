Got deleted asshole

i was not able to find the clip it only said s14 e6 which is a lie because i literally just watch it n it start with hayley n jeff wih a pregnancy test so i have no fucking clue what youre talking avout
---
Yeah! Look up a youtube video on how to start it and go on the lfg to grab and group and go through it!
---
leaving aside NF, getting to fabled is more a question of luck with matchmaking than your own skill for most players. even if you 4 stack on the way there, there's no guarantee you won't just be stomped by another 4 stack way above your skill level repeatedly
---
You are a sorry excuse for a human being.
---
You in trouble now...
---
if you find the damm clip post it
---
Wrong again. Some of us do our own homework.
---
The description for the which witch challenge is misleading. Deployable objects that are vulnerable to damage ex. Tether, ward of dawn can fail the challenge if they get hit
---
Good players who legitimately earned it are still good and will probably still kill you
---
Catalyst sucks but the ship is the coolest looking ship ever there is no other ship out there that can be it
---

---
***Sarcasm***
---
this is me every time i return to clear out postmaster but forget to turn in my weapon frames
---
I’ve got a rapid hit / kill clip roll with a range masterwork. Pretty happy with it, not gonna lie.
---
Yep
---
??? I’m not arguing with you dude I’m on you’re side lol
---
ok did more looking around idk why it called s14 but it not s14 because the ep is called lost child the s14 ep 6 is called roger's baby so wtf
---
The endgame is where the game really starts. It doesn't take very long to power through the campaign.
---
don't give up, it's one of the most painful grinds i have ever done in this game and felt like quitting multiple times but the reward is definitely worth it. it may be a pvp pinnacle weapon but it shines in pve. Mountaintop is an absolute boss melter if you have lunafaction or rally barricade. with well, it's an easy 50+% damage to primeval on your own, with 2 or more guys running mountaintop you could 1 phase the primeval in prime
---
it literaly season 16 not 14 so wtf does that mean 4 season are just gone wtf
---
Crimson should be in A tier 
---
It’s reload on precision kills and health regen is really good and if you can hit the bursts well enough in crucible it kills
---
No, play it you’re fine. Endgame is easy to get. 
---
Most people will look out for your exotics in which you can get 4 exotics +1 if tou decide to get an engram. From xur which will help you level up.
---
The story can be easily rushed through though you might need to level up. 
---
If you grab forsaken now you can bump yourself up to level 30 and do the campaign and other dlcs. 
---
Get the destiny app on your phone, on this you can look for lfgs for people to help you or you help them. 
---
I can’t really list everything but the point is its fine if you’re late but in fact you’re just in time for season of opulence where there will be a power boost forsaken and/or annual pass owners. I really reccomend it but you might have to grind a bit more than other games quickly to get to ‘endgame’ level.
---
I’m on console and those two wreck in crucible and gambit
---
Cool story bro
---
Yeah they probably nerfed it for the same reason as sleeper, as that hadn't really been used in any situation since warmind. I just think the nerf was a bit too much, as now the gun basically is just a super high impact sniper that reloads automatically. Theres just no reason to use it really after the nerf unless some super specific scenario is introduced where it would be good.
---
That's the ugliest ship i've ever seen, who even wants to grind for this? At least the Whisper's ship was amazing, this thing is hideous.
---
Whisper is still better than Black Spindle overall because of Box-Breathing. And it is only slightly worse than Black Hammer because the ammo is limited. 
---
But in D1, we didn't have rally barricade and/or Well. Hence, the gun is still gonna be really good.
---
Yeah it will still be good just not anything special.
---
Thanks, but does anyone have an uncropped not 16bit picture of it? Usually people want to show this shit off and I cant avoid it even if I dont want to see it. Why cant I find a picture of it? Wth?
---
Sorry, your submission has been automatically removed.

It appears you are asking a question about LFG/Clans, or help in-game.

Please post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/89vbwr/official_lfg_megathread_version_20/?sort=new) instead, look at the LFG dropdown menu on the top bar of the subreddit for various LFG tools, or check the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/8ji06r/official_faq_please_read_before_posting/) for possibly helpful advice on how to find people to play with our advertise/find clans.

I literally have that roll without sureshot :/ I still use my 150s over it. I also play on pc though i keep hearing that makes a difference. was my first drop from zavala to. No wonde ri cant get anarchy or any of the nightfall guns :C used up all my luck on a gun i dont even use!
---
Just keep doing the tangled Shore heroics and pray to RNG. It took 2 cycles for me to get the baron chest on my hunter. Last day of the week I got 2. 
---
Going for the robes now.
---
Nice, have you started playing the new content yet?
---
What sparrow?
---
Ain’t that the truth
---
Oof
---
thats actually really cool I didnt know that!
---
Dismantle the Kindled Orchid, or keep it, and pray that you get that shader on another weapon someday.
---
Damn, thanks
---
Couldn't have put it any better Thanx
---
Its just one more ship that we will never equip. Who Cares about getting more ships ? Nobody
---
If there's shit in the vault i dont use(ie: ghost shells, shaders, random low power weapons/armor that aren't at max LL)
---
J jumped from 1100 to 2200 today, just for the fact of a clan mate rubbing my face in not having recluse, and it was worth it
---
I think he wanted a free kill with a specific weapon.
---
Not from the vanguard
---
THAT'S WHAT THAT WAS!!
---
I regret nothing. He can call me snitch and I’ll call him old fart.
---
Same for me but with Last word and Thorn, ironic...
---
It's like a pug. I love it.
---
I miss trials
---
im hoarse
---
why isnt that a one hit kill? warlocks and titans have one hit kill melee abilities...
---
Kill them with kindness  .. best way .. after that they fell like assholes ..
---
Raids are (to me) the very best content in the game. It's a shame that many people don't experience them, for one reason or another.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you're new to raiding and want someone to guide you, then i will gladly help with any raid. This isn't just adressed to OP, but anyone who sees this, feel free to contact me!
---
Honestly i have no idea where the horse meme came from, but the only thing i can think of reading it is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuvdeEC5y8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=72).
---
Thing is, as a design it's actually a really well made ship. People are mixing up theme with design here and getting mad over it.
---
If you wanted a rust punk theme, they absolutely nailed it, it's just that most people didn't want that and instead wanted a more tati-cool aesthetic like the Whisper ship or the Platinum Starling.
---
I'm not gonna use this ship myself because its not something I'd like, but I seriously think people are being dumb if they call it a "lazy ship" just because it's not the aesthetic they like.
---
A horse
---
I'm right there with you man. Played comp a few months ago with lfg, had a bad match and teammate messaged me to stop playing comp.  i responded with the only reasonable answer...fk off.
---
what?
---
Love my calcium tokens
---
Cause 2014 is pre-nerf
---
You never noticed it spawned manures on precision kills?
---
alright fellas we got us some nasty builds today
---
Coulda sworn I heard The Marquis in there?
---
Don't let it bug you. These are random people online who mean absolutely nothing to you. 
---
Why let an irrelevant nobody fuck with your enjoyment of a game?
---
So they tbag, it's nothing to be upset about. Ignore and move on.
---
Have you done the steps to make the frame ready to forge?
---
No that's not what I'm pointing out. The nanites on kill is known to everybody. What I'm pointing out is the damage difference.
---
Oh boy the nostalgia that this meme brought me kek
---
I have, now the missions says I have to Ignite the forge in the EDZ
---
Exotic class items that increases super gained from teammate orbs.
---
yup, but note that you can't get the special forge specific shaders from bergusia if you're looking to fill out your collections. if you're only looking for god rolls/exotics, do bergusia, riskrunner + outrageous fortune with spike nades and you're good to go
---
another character
---
I’m close to NF at around 4300 but at this rate I’ll never make legend by the end of this season :/.
---
If it was last week's mission, then no.
---
If it is this week's mission and you have already done it, then no again, unless you can join somebody who still has it to do
---
you can't join a comp match mid game, not sure how the 4th guy made it in so late, assuming some connection error or something. either way. 4 stack and then go in, solo queue is a roll of the dice every time you go for a new round.
---
Are you speaking strictly for PVP?  Because it's a PVE god.  You can do the Aphelions Rest lost sector in about 4-5 reloads.
---
In all honesty, all the Destiny content creators sort of blur into one. 
---
Except for 2 Lore guys that I know by name. 
---
But as soon as I read your comment, the punctuation and choice of words allowed me to pull a voice out of my head, and I knew who you were talking about.
---
I was like, oh yeah that guy!
---
Here's an upvote for a excellent presentation and punctuation.
---
I’m certainly seeing more Silver-exclusive items. They just released another Sparrow exclusive to a silver purchase, I believe?
---
The hell are you talking about
---
Yep, he’s a troll
---
How much did it cost to make?
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 13.
---
Check our LFG thread on the sidebar, and also the Team-up Tuesday megathread on /r/DestinyTheGame. (It's pinned on their sidebar.)
---
Ah okay, I just unlocked Reckoner and wanted to share the image but thanks for clarification!
---
YEEEEEET
---
If Reckoner is your 3rd or 4th Title or something - you could show them all! That's allowed.
---
Love the way the dude says "bois" and "fellas".
---
my boi sweet business is good and fun
---
as long bungie can reskin pinnacle weapons - I CAN TOO XD
---
Said no one ever
---
This is the biggest problem, the ship adds NOTHING to the story (yet)
---
Guess I don’t exist now damb 😔
---
What warlock melee are you using cause I need that lol /s
---
Mouse Kaybard.
---
Oh. Nevermind then. Hope they are well.
---
As someone who is usually the designated invader hats off to whoever pulls this off. One of the easiest ways that I can say someone outplayed me.
---
Yeah sunbracers are pretty fun. I also really like transversive steps for a really mobile dawnblade setup.
---
thats nasty
---
yeah, sounds fine
---
What is that and what rolls if it rolls random?
---
He has wallhack. If he sees 3 people in his scope and not 4, maybe take that as a clue that someone's trying to flank.
---
For guns the meta perks, like outlaw/rampage snapshot/quickdraw only the best ones stay. Regarding armor only enchanced perks or god roll regulars like one type combos,  shotgun loader and scavanger on arms. Exotic armor i keep everything as usually they have different rolls. Not keeping any of the ever verse crap only in collection.
---
He's shooting you at range against a melee super, and isn't trying to get crits.
---
Yea I turned it down Because it was super loud (My snowball picks up everything) I'll know better for next time thanks man!
---
I keep grabbing the wrong srceenshot
---
You are literally shaxx. btw how do i get shin malphur title on this sub?
---
a huge destiny fan wouldnt need to ask, just dive in my friend.
---
My thoughts exactly, Ursa has been sitting in my vault since the first nerf along side OEM. They better have good news this week and not just tell us the catalysts that were already data mined are going to slowly trickle into the game
---
Definitely a kick in the nuts out of nowhere, that buff. Thank God they haven't touched Synthos... running out of reasons to main Titan (I literally have just the one character).
---
Kinda felt bad about the Hunter/Warlock nerfs, but honestly it was hard to drum up sympathy. Really starting to get sick of standing there with my thumb in my ass while Nova bombs, Wells, and tethers kill everything before I can manage to get a shot off. Being carried by default is boring.
---
Some people won't do a reckoning with more than one titan, I look for those lobbies--the game is way more fun and engaging when it's a challenge.
---
The entire meta is changing since so many weapons and armor is getting nerfed. Work towards pinnacle weapons such as 21% and the recluse, the last word, thorn, and most importantly do raids for a chance at 1k voices and anarchy. Other than that zero hour is fresh and new and give you outbreak perfected, one of the best boss primaries ever.
---
If you made more of these, how much for one?
---
They will be doin a triple infamy. They confirmed it on twitter
---
Seems like such.a good dude Cross. :)
---
No, you can kill him. I killed the captain and knight simultaneously back in the beginning of D2. It just accepts the Captain surviving as canon.
---
Okay cool, nightfall’s worth doing anymore?
---
Oh definitely
---
ohw really? i didn't even know 😂
---
They're just another power bump now, but if you can hit 100,000 score, you'll get 2 rewards.
---
Because DeeJ got Peregrine Greave'd after self-rezzing in trials.
---
not on Galanor Week *mayhem*
---
Yeah Queen's walk glitches are the worst. We did ours last season and got guitared a dozen times or so before finally nailing it. Had a super competent group though so we only lost to Queen's walk glitches which made it a bit more bearable.
---
this man, he is the son of Saint-14
---
It is ~~s~~crap ~~metal~~.
---
console?
---
OK then I'll keep trying
---
This is what I like
---
Yeah, you got till next tuesday to run rampart
---
Thunderlord is great, but hammerhead is way more reliable.
---
1k is great, but doesnt really shine on most gambit maps tbh. Again, can do way more with a hammerhead and much easier to without the accidentally killing yourself from that shotgunner.
---
using izanagis you jump in with honed edge, pop one poor sod off regardless of what hes doing or what his health is, pull out your hammerhead and clean up. Izanagis isnt the main weapon but if you have enough ammo then i guess you could do 4 the hard hard way if you really wanted.
---
I'm in the right side of wrong... 
---
until tuesday
---
My last one was Phoenix Protocol.
---
Prevents the damage.
---
Buy it every week
---
An exotic that makes you drop MORE orbs on super kills would be nice, or like another guy said, an exotic that increases super gain on orb pickup.
---
I became an American just through watching his videos.
---
I have been but I'm thinking it's going to be the last one I get.
---
At least I only have a few exotics left to get.
---
Pc
---
You’ve restarted the pc I assume?
---
titans have the best neutral game all around with things like skullfort wrecking shit in pve and ofc there's oem in pvp. but titan supers are ridiculously underwhelming in pve endgame stuff, which is a damn shame
---
No one uses it because of the grind lol no one has that much free time
---
PvE stomp meta is too strong and has been around fot 4 years
---
How would you know? I bet you don’t even have broadsword! And when you say yes you may be lying so...
---
Pic restart did it. That was very weird. Never seen that happen before
---
Pvp sorry for the late response.
---
