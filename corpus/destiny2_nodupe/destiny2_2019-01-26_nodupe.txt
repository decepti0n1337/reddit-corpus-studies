This ‚òù
---
---
---
&gt; Honestly, one of my biggest complaints about Destiny is that nothing is really explained in-game.
---

---
Yeah I just started playing and this has annoyed me to no end. I have a pretty limited amount of free time to game and I'd like to spend it actually playing the game rather than reading articles and watching youtube videos to learn how things work.
---
Ah, so you're right next door to D2 then.
---
There is not. I have heard that once you get one, you should stop opening nodes, because you're probably not going to get a second one within the same day. 
---
Okay, thank you
---
The soft cap didn't change with Black Armory. It might stay the same for Joker's Wild. 
---
Yes I know, I was mocking the blueberry and showing my mockiness!
---
I‚Äôm a hunter main trying to get my titan up. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have the luck for exotics 
---
then why did you have no goddamn quotes around it?
---
You do realize they saying no right now cuz they have the better system. When it was ps3 and xbox 360 Microsoft was the one to say no to cross platform 
---
I'll tolerate your black ops 4 skin make sure regime skin for assualt rifle
---
I had the same thing happen to me earlier except we where the ones to lose. You don‚Äôt happen to play ps4 do you lol
---
Depends on your power level. I finished the Forsaken campaign and wasn‚Äôt high enough level yet for it.
---
This is yet another good reason why Bungie left Activision
---
How about you explain on these stupid posts how to turn it heroic instead of whining? 
---
Does that still work?
---
O quit sucking the cool aid out of Sony‚Äôs dick, the point stands that cross platform between Xbox and PlayStation would be good for everyone that plays games!
---
I had the same problem
---
Time for what else?  With a 50% increase you can then get a quick bounty for more gear (materials if you don't like the legendary drop and a core). It takes less time to do heroic then to do two, especially if everyone is in the circle as it speeds it up.
---
Epic
---
I am close to 600 so i will probably wait for the next reset get to 600 then buy the annual pass.
---
I'm not denying it I'm just saying that's what Microsoft gets when they said no the first time 
---
51 more headshots and it‚Äôs yours!!! You can do it!!! 
---
She did, about a year ago.
---
YouTube. Literally almost every Destiny YouTuber has made a tutorial about it. I‚Äôm not explaining it to someone who won‚Äôt listen 
---
That's the point of then rotating eververse items, showing your experience.
---
Any tips for those still trying? How did you deal with the toxic meta?
---
‚ÄúWhat cypher is this?‚Äù
---
Well pvp is gonna be fun
---
I played during those times yet didnt get it. Maybe not as crazy as when Forsaken dropped but because RNG is not kind to me, should I be locked out of it too? I understand wanting something unique but it shouldn't be gated by rng and then not return.
---
This super is already my favourite super in the game. Not only because I'm a hunter main but because I adore characters like Cayde, Shin Malphur, Dredgen etc. I love the rogue hunter style. But what makes this better is that this is gonna be amazing in crucible, think of the feeds and easy seventh columns 
---
Playing the heroic mission of ‚Äúhope‚Äù with minimal UI is so rad on this mission...
---
More people have lmgs than a forsaken exotic though...
---
‚ÄúNothing is wrong‚Äù
---
I was really expecting a teammate to show up at the last moment, bumping you away from the ledge.
---
The old Iron Banner cloak ornament is still my favorite cloak. Bungo pls make Y1 armor relevant again
---
No. We change our opinions every few days. 
---
Thank f**** someone finally gets it I swear half of my teammates and I have take the heavy ammo and don't invade so when I invade there that complain about how I invade don't have heavy and I'm using a pulse rifle and getting kills I'm like popping heads like grapes
---
She she's dead
---
warning: contains wheat and no forsaken
---
This is my case as well. I grinded out every prophecy weapon and did sleeper and all of it before Warmind. Just wasnt blessed with this emote as RNG hates me.
---
i love to bank 5 at a time i get hate mail all the time when i do it from my team telling me its a waste of time 
---
We can't all roll Geomags, Karen
---
they just broke gg
---
When was pvp fun lol
---
Real shit I've had this FOUR TIMES
---
It's going on 2 years since this game came out. Stop whining about this already.
---
There are some of us that grinded during CoO and still didnt get it as well. Being luck based it should be brought back in my opinion.
---
By the was general reddiquette dictates that /s literally means sarcasm  
---
You can't expect anything to be exclusive in this game because there's always something they'll bring back. It's best just to be happy that everyone can enjoy your favourite stuff too. 
---
It‚Äôs pretty fun to use double jump extended height with frostees to go insanely high up
---
There are other movement abilities besides triple jump?
---
Did you not pick up on the /s
---
Yes I have finished it. Got Cade's gun. Uldrig is history
---
You mean stompees? 
---
It's BS that someone who paid $40 for the game gets what you got when you paid $90
---
My bad
---
Is that a...?
---
Is this a random drop?
---
God damn I hate that event, everyone fucking kills the small blights and I'm the only one trying to make it heroic
---
Eh. It has a pretty good perk but I haven't found it super useful. Clearing ads is all it can really do to me. 
---
Unless my bounty is for heroics, I generally don't care, but if I see you trying to make it heroic, I help.
---
i got my jotunn and monarque in two consecutive forge runs after the reset
---
It basically is a reworked Red Death. It‚Äôs a decent hand cannon, I‚Äôve gotten a lot of miles out of it in PVE and it was what I used to get the Ace of Spades. 
---
I'm sure you've noticed other players doing something besides the stated public event objective. [Take a look at this](https://www.niris.tv/blog/hpe)
---
You used to get better loot. Now it's about the xp, the flashpoint progress, the lore pages, the quest progress, or the daily bounties. 
---
I agree
---
Very true.  Variety helps the game's longevity.  At least we're not still all using graviton lance the days,  but there's room for improvement. 
---
It's required for some things, like collecting certain lore pages or completing certain quests. 
---
I feel like most heroic events are either the same length or shorter. For bounties that ask you to do public events and count using a percent, and for flashpoints, heroic events count more.
---
Nice idea I might have to try using it to work on spades
---
Heroic public events give more xp, and some are required for end game quests, or to get lore pages, or to get achievements. 
---
These past couple days have been Fuckin horrid
---
Yeah I could buy that from spider with the mats I don‚Äôt useüòÇ
---
Congratulations man üëåüëå
---
Play both at the same time. Its the only way. 
---
yeah it's tough people usually just finish and then dip because the timer ran out...I honestly dont even look at light level any more cause I'm 650 and it doesn't matter anymore I'll RIP a boss solo pretty much 
---
I've done some more testing on living targets this time, the number doesn't seem to correspond with the bullets fired at all, or the damage for that matter. it always shot 4 bullets regardless of what the number was showing and the damage for each bullet was exactly the same (for crits and bodyshots respectively). It was a cool idea and it sounded plausible but it doesn't seem like the numbers indicate anything at all. My best guess is that this was the plan during the design phase of the gun and they just didn't end up going with it, and forgot to take the counter out.
---
No he sells exotics
---
With rampage its more of a PVE roll, congrats.
---
So I got dropped a level 610 crimson. Should I got to Xur and buy one that's at level 630 or just enhance it with a drop? (I'm level like 630 light)
---
What‚Äôs with everyone trying to plow through them without making them Heroic anyway? Don‚Äôt they watch YouTube?
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
I just want that Trials armor back.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the repetitive ‚ÄúBungie Suggestions‚Äù or the posts of screenshots of people using Gambit phrasing in other subreddits that annoy me more about this subreddit. Probably the former,  but not by much. 
---
It's because there are probably hundreds of guides you can find with a single google search, so people get annoyed when someone asks instead of trying to figure things out for themselves. 
---
got to be a good feeling getting that after it was the easiest exotic questline to complete only 2-3 months ago, and missing it, cheers! 
---
ST is uber rad! Be prepared to enjoy it :) Yea, pvp; Crimson Days revolves around the Duos playlist specifically
---
There's also a triumph for it, I think. I'm not sure if it's one that unlocks any lore, but it's there all the same.
---
Also, /u/ZombieKingofEngland made an excellent observation [over here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/ajewr6/bungie_for_the_love_of_gambit_please_teach_your/eevkqw2/) that the Malfeasance quest line is actually teaching people how to play Gambit by punishing more hoarders and invade effectively.
---
yep
---
I sure will! Thanks for all the info. 
---
ok, thanks!!!
---
üí™
---
Good luck!
---
They actually made Destiny 1, all the content for it, all of Destiny 2 year 1, Forsaken, everything, all just to troll us. 
---
You've cracked the code. 
---
Maybe so, but it's a lot easier, faster, and efficient to write up a quick comment and (hopefully) receive a succinct. helpful response than have to search for, read, and digest a bunch of information online. 
---
But I suppose it's easier to go your route, than simply help new players and answer their questions. 
---
Ty that's what I needed ur very helpful 
---
Maybe they haven't said anything because they haven't found a good fix or made a final decision yet. I imagine there's some R&amp;D and testing that goes into changes like that that take time. I'm sure there's also other issues and tweaks being addressed similarly. 
---
Especially the taken blite one when you put like a million shots into it lol.
---
You know this has been around since d1 right lol
---
Alright hunter main, calm down. 
---
Yes, probably. Try turning you FVO to max aswell. Overwatch are more fast-paste
---
r/sbubby
---
It‚Äôs cause she doesn‚Äôt give two shits if they waste their resources or potentially die for her cause. It‚Äôs not like she gives us shit in return yet we keep doing her bidding 
---
That's rich coming from an admitted Follower of the Emo King. 
---
Well my game says Forsaken. No I dont have the access to Spider. 
---
my bad, I came off like  sarcastic ass, congrats on getting an amazing weapon 
---
6 attempts, got there eventually. 
---
Add me, same name SN as here and in NorCal.
---
Shoot man add me. I got the same step. That recommended power level is way off I think
---
i am currently grinding for breakneck and what can i say...
---
solo queing is starting to make me question my fetish
---
It's fine. Thank you
---

---
The crowd really puts this whole scene together
---
Ok what is your gamer name
---
Rollind24. Not on tonight but if you still need it tomorrow I‚Äôll be on
---
Oh. I dont have the annual pass like I said. So no black armory yet. I have forsaken. I have been that guy that goes out there with avalanche and just blasts the fucker dead.
---
Chuckles in sidearm
---
Ok 
---
I suck with the shotgun so I rarely find close enough quarters to use it. I still keep it handy though. Still a one shot kill if I put it directly under their chin.
---
It drops from any PVE enemy
---
Good shit mate, I don‚Äôt have queenbreaker, wish I did but I‚Äôve been wiping with sleeper stimulant. I‚Äôm so done with gambit. 9 kills away from malfeasance 
---
I understand all too well
---
How did u get ur anthem code bc I got mine from Nvidia 
---
there was actually 6 voids. all 6 of us immediately gave up that round
---
Yeah it is. It's from this week at bungie 
---
Might seem like a prank to you, but its not funny. Have you considered this could result in retaliation which would negatively impact this community? And have you thought about the fact there will be moderators there who have to waste their time cleaning up those posts? 
---
I'm not having a go, I'm just saying. Pranks are fun and games untill you start impacting communities.
---
If Anthem is in your Library, go here https://www.origin.com/aus/en-us/store/anthem/anthem and click "Try it First"

This happens to me all the time. I shoot at them too. I want a wtf is wrong with you emote.

Doesnt help you a whole lot even if bugged

So I am no recruiter for the clan I am in but I have a great time with the clan I am in. The clan is PHG it has like 10 or so branches. The clan is very active 24/7 it has some really cool people and it is great to setup stuff in advance. Say you you want to run a raid 3 days from now at a certain time you can make an event set the time and people can join your event and it works great. There is different sections on the discord like for each raid, for forges/blind well/ep, strikes, pvp and misc stuff and it makes it so easy to find people to join you.

Usually kinda meh about fan art, but this is really cool. Colors look awesome
---
hahaha i actually did do a warlock and hunter together not long ago! \^\_\^
---
aw thank you so much!
---
At that time all i wanna do is empty a clip on him, but probably he won't know what's going on... 
---
I do like her character, but man is this true!
---
We‚Äôve bailed out her arse plenty of times now, and still playing hard to get. Mind telling us what the plan is, love?
---
Just got mine today as well! I‚Äôll still probably use my blast furnace but it still feels good to have gotten
---
I got queensbreaker last night in comp so I shall second this
---
Yeah, it's true that you should be able to kill with every weapons, but cmon, LMGs are the most reliable way to get kills when invading. I highly wouldn't recommend invading without super/heavy
---
It's the damage done to his shield. The more damage the more super charge he gets back
---
This. 
---
This is the main reason why I don't bother with Heroic unless there's a bounty or quest involved. Just not worth the extra time and effort. 
---
I didn't want to be 650 anyway...
---
Weird flex, but okay 
---
Lost sector in firebase Hades, Pathfinder's crash, you can quickly kill adds then boss and leave in like 1 minute.
---
And he has and special drop or just grinding?
---
Grinding, got 1 prime and 2 normal purples hopefully a decent dust rock too.
---
Cool. Ty for the info.
---
People might think he is luckier than op originally was because 2 of then are quests.
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **2nd Cakeday** PrematureNut! ^(hug)
---
While doing the Scourge of the past raid I found out about skipping a jumping puzzle part within it using the same sparrow trick and when doing this lost sector I noticed the similarities, attempted the same skip and so here we are now many radiant seeds later :)
---
Well....bye.
---
Play more matches? And win 
---
Bottom staking is a medieval practice that should be left behind üòÇ 
---
That was good lol
---
Just challenge them in the ways of old. Standard sword fight with optimal amounts of baggage 
---
Nope, you are just lucky
---
Strange brag, I‚Äôll allow it 
---
I hope it has grave robber
---
Win-loss stat does not mean shit in solo queue.   
---
I can lose a game with efficiency 5.0 while four of my teammates have efficiency &lt;1.0, some of them 0.17 and 0.21. Suddenly I am a bad player due to mediocre win-loss ratio? Please.  
---
Got one range trifecta god roll in like, 3 hours of farming. And it had moving target and graverobber on it. lmao
---
That's dragged in
---
I like twilight oath, still looking for one with snapshot on it
---
Shax: OH NO. HEHEHE.
---
is there a list of god roll stuff. ive got so much do dismantle but i don't wanna dismantle something rare!
---
you'll be tankier but if you're health goes critical you'll need to cover for longer. That's what it's like.
---
that a lot of dorito dust on your armor
---
Awesome drawing, real talent. 
---
Butta.... #TitansMasterrace
---
Hahaha The Seinfeld music. It totally played in my head when I read that.
---
Yes you require a lot of call outs in last wish especially in the riven boss fight 
---
I hope bungie puts something in that tops out at 725 or something. Even when at max, it‚Äôs going to be difficult. Then when people whine and cry again, bungie should increase the level to make it harder. 
---
The forge was fine before the level nerf. People just needed to change how they played so they complemented their fireteam, not continue to try and solo an area. After the crybabies got their way, it very quickly became a joke. 
---
This is the best meme we‚Äôve had in awhile. If I had gold, you‚Äôd get it OP
---
It's so true though! You see the red on your map and get all confident and before you know it a Titan slides around the corner, your game turns black and white, the bass line hits, and you die
---
/r/phalanxed
---
I got one shot in Crucible by a 556 power dude and a blue hand cannon. Crucible shouldn't be THAT balanced.
---
looks like a warframe
---
Good shit man, once again another ‚ÄúNobody will care but...‚Äù I‚Äôm getting tilted
---
I rarely see other Titans. Most just Hunters and Warlocks for me. Nothing but Blade Barrage and Nova Warps all over the place. Can't wait till the hand cannon/shotgun profile gets shook up.
---
Happens ever fuck time
---
_laughs in Izanagi‚Äôs_

I wish this was an actual shader :/

\*Cries in hammerhead\*

1. Completed the quest
---
2. Completed the quest
---
3. Acquired Lemon with pretty high drop rate (basically the highest droprate for an exotic), which you will stash after having fun for a few hours with it.
---
Nothing of the above fits "it's been a good day" phrase.  
---
It might be cheeto dust 
---
There‚Äôs an app for iOS called Where is Xur? 
---
Pretty handy
---
Already on it
---
NEW CONTENT.  Start leveling once it drops seems fair to me. No more basement dwellers getting a head start on raids
---
Happy Birthday fellow Light-bearer 
---
They might hate the rumble game mode, yet have to do the 25 games for broadsword 
---
I see. So which forsaken do I need to buy. There are like 3 different options. 
---
The fated engrams always gives you exotic you dont own so it should be the last thing you buy
---
Thats why you open the engram first
---
I got hallowfire last week as well for my top tree. EP waves absolutely melt. (Pun intended)
---
The important thing is that he didn‚Äôt
---
damn you're actually able to play? the game is a laggy mess for me atm
---
Yeh, look at comments I'm already raging there xD.
---
How do they get so much ammo for it? It's a power weapon. I get power ammo once or twice a night when I play. I do suck though. I'm 650 with decent weapons (Breakneck/Ikelos SG) I just don't know the maps like these other dudes.
---
I salute you for doing it in comp. I've been doing mine in QP.
---
I've been playing Destiny for over 3 years. I know how they work. 
---
Where did you get it from?! 
---
I've been playing Destiny for over 3 years. I know how it works. 
---
Vigilance wing
---
Then why did you buy it first? 
---
You can't really blame Xur his will is not his own.
---
It‚Äôs when Petra is standing in Rheasilvia 
---
I do not recommend it in gambit, since your power level matters for invasions, even though it doesn't matter for the enemies. 
---
I can only imagine if the meta in QP are one shot hand cannons and shotguns it can only be worse in Comp
---
[There's some videos hoere](https://www.youtube.com/user/tassssssssss/search?query=mysterious+box) showing how to get the box and how to get each key. 
---
There are some exotics that are very worth it such as Orpheus Rigs for the hunter or Luna faction boots for I would recommend just buying whatever you dont have for the character you play. but really it's up to you.
---
&gt; And i find it hard to blame people for not paying attention, especially solo queuing.
---
But this is literally the problem though. You can make it as obvious as you like but when people don't pay attention, of course you can blame them. 
---
See: Drifter calls "BANK THE MOTES AND SUMMON, YOU DUMB APES", and there's still 2 teammates running round trying to collect 15. 
---
&gt; An ogre isn't worth the risk
---
It's absolutely worth it when the opposing team has no portals ready. 15 banked &gt; 14 + 1 banked. 
---
1) play the base game do the campaign + the DLC campaigns and then decide if you want to keep playing if you do go for the season pass Forsaken and the other updates tied to it like Black Armory are real game changers
---
2) you can play solo MOST the content is solo do able outside the Raid (you can get free chests from that raid for the equipment) . People will say this is huge by a MASSIVE swath of the Destiny players have not played a raid ever let alone completed one (D1 + D2)
---
3) there are many good guides but a quick tip is dont infuse everything all the time, your light is based on what your holding and can use not what you have in your "active slots"   Also exotics are not always the best solution.
---
See me in game? I hope not. Officer Mediocre. 
---
I never found Sleeper to be any good in Gambit, due to it's slow charge time. Mostly I use Pulse Rifles, Snipers and the occasional LMG when I can get some HA.
---
&gt; like you should not be waiting for the heavy ammo spawn at bank, because teams that know what they're doing can melt primevil in less than a minute
---
Heavy ammo is to invade. 
---
&gt;But if you're stealing kills (like a LOT of pubs do),
---
Stealing kills? More like sprinting up and stealing motes. 
---
&gt;There are bigger problems than sending blockers...because blockers aren't that huge of an issue for me
---
You've obviously not had to handle 4 phalanxes up at once with a knight sent in as soon as you head to the bank. 
---
If you enjoy doing the same thing over and over and over and over and over, yeah, this game might be for you.  But it‚Äôs a mindless time waster.  If crucible was fun it might be different, but crucible is just farm supers, camp heavy spawn, and use titan with OEM.  Gone are the days where gunskill matter.  This is just a super hero simulator where everyone is made to feel like a god.  It‚Äôs what failing games do to try and keep players around. Make everyone feel good.
---
I had them drop from a bather in Leviathan. :D 
---
I still can‚Äôt oneshot stuff with queenbreaker.
---
Maybe i should stop playing gambit
---
1. Without DLC, you can enjoy this game, but it's the sort of game you play until you are finished  and then there is no reason to come back. To add more replayability and long term enjoyment, you should buy Forsaken, but you do not need to buy anything else. 
---
2. I have spent more time solo in this game than with other players. There are only a handful of activities it is not possible to solo. These are the exotic item quests Rat King and On the Comms/The World Eater. You also cannot solo raids, and there is one raid in the base game. Then there are activities that are difficult to solo, but possible, such as nightfalls. The only end game to speak of without Forsaken is the Leviathan raid and nightfalls, unfortunately. 
---
3. There is the FAQ stickied to the front of this subreddit. /r/destinythegame has a Returning Players Guide, which is still helpful even if you are a new player. 
---
Some things I think every player should know:
---
* Completing the main story unlocks some conveniences, such as a vehicle to zoom around on, and being able to turn in stuff to each vendor in exchange for random items. But don't feel like you need to rush if you don't want to. The #1 thing all my friends say they wish they knew is that there is nothing wrong with taking your time. A lot of mechanics are never outright stated, so it is possible to miss them if you charge through on autopilot. 
---
* You can level up really fast by doing [Heroic public events](https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/2017/9/7/16263480/heroic-public-events-find-trigger-earth-titan-nessus-io) if you complete a secret objective during public events. Leveling up unlocks the other two elemental subclasses. You will eventually get enough upgrade points to unlock everything, and you can swap between each subclass and subclass tree at will. 
---
* When you look at the director and hold E, it should tell you what you are supposed to do next to advance the story. 
---
* When you encounter enemies with shields, use your secondary weapon to break the shield, and if it is the same element as the shield colour, it will do bonus damage and cause an explosion when the shield breaks. 
---
* The maximum level in the base game is 20 and the maximum light level is 300, but after 260-ish you will need to do weekly and daily challenges (basically, any activity that says "powerful gear") in order to reach 300. With all three DLCs the max level is 50 and the max light level is 650, and you need to do challenges to get above 500. This is "the grind." 
---
* This game is around 80% pve content and 20% pvp content. 
---
* Most guides for base game content have not been updated ever, so the terminology and some information about how to progress are outdated. However, guides for DLC content are mostly new enough that this is not a problem.
---
* The in-game chat is always very quiet, but do not confuse this for the game being dead. Most people communicate using Discord and other programs like that. To find people to play with, you can use this subreddit's discord (linked in the top right on desktop) or the /r/destinythegame discord (linked in their sidebar). There is also the official Destiny 2 app, /r/fireteams, /r/destinysherpa for raids (do not worry about this until later), or platform-specific things. 
---
Yeah I get that, I really wish I had queen breaker though. It‚Äôd make gambit a hell of a lot easier
---
Subtile Calamity + Ace of Spades, just keep some distance
---
Thanks 
---
Yes, imagine a team of 2 titans/2 hunters, all with OEM/BB/Luna/Dust Rock. 
---
I got it to drop in a heroic story mission last night.  
---
So edgy XD RaNdOm
---
Shattered Throne is available during the third week of the Dreaming City's three week cycle. You can tell which week it is by what the Dreaming City looks like. [Here is an album of screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/U3CvlXm) comparing the first and third weeks. If you don't want to physically travel there, look at where Petra is. 
---
The Strand: First, least cursed week
---
Divalian Mists: Second, middle week
---
Rheasilvia: Third, most cursed week.
---
Bungie mentioned that not too long ago, they were rushed to finish Forsaken then made a shit ton of patches back to back so the underlying code started to smell and cause performance issues.  They fixed a chunk of it but some of it is still there
---
I miss that thing
---
DONT shoot the help.
---
It 100% is. However, there's something to know about it. 
---
There are different damage falloff ranges for hip fire and 'aim-down-sight' firing modes. 
---
When you're hip firing, the damage is significantly higher per pellet when whatever you're shooting at is from 0 to about 20 meters, after that the damage starts dropping off. When you're shooting while ADS (aim down sight), the damage is actually ***lower*** than hip fire shooting from 0-20 meters. If you scope in after that your target is just beyond that magical distance, the damage just magically ramps up to higher than the hip fir mode per-pellet.
---
It's weird, but fun to use. Also melts barricades in quickplay PvP. 
---
Things in your postmaster don't disappear. Source: had a gun in the postmaster on a character I haven't played on in weeks. 
---
Wouldnt storm make more sense.
---
Seeing both sith force lightning and storm lightning are both, well lightning...
---
They said don‚Äôt hold onto the IB ones as it will mark the new IB bounties as complete, meaning you will miss out on 700 for that armor set, unless you want to spend 100 tokens and 10 enhancement cores on pre-rolled perks that‚Äôs fine
---
So I would just farm the lost sector in Hellas basin (look up a video), that the fastest way to get stems, so you can do more nodes
---
Honestly that's probably the worst part, in my opinion, after that you can pretty much keep your distance while doing damage. The very last part you don't have as much room but you have a few spots where you can take cover when you need to. I'll send you a PM. I need to help my brother through that one still too.
---
Exactly!
---
Alright thanks!
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
I haven‚Äôt gotten a non duplicate exotic in 6 weeks, you can fuck right on out of here with your magically spectacular RNG.
---
First forge will be hard unless you have a solid 620+ fireteams even at 610.
---
If you want to solo it 625 is the minimum you want and 635 to do the second to third forge.
---
Xur doesn't sell forsaken exotics because he can't get them either 
---
If your teammate has 14 motes-and they didn‚Äôt just kill the HV Target-then they‚Äôre doing it wrong. And if your teammate runs past the bank with 14 to get one more from the other side only to get invaded and killed it isn‚Äôt your fault, they should have banked 14.
---
Five at a time is a better strategy, more blockers, less to lose. 
---
Don‚Äôt blame your teammate for not letting you get a 15th mote, because you‚Äôre the problem.
---
What‚Äôs the armor piece? (Sorry I‚Äôm apparently a casual)
---
I've been a faithful Voidwalker since D1. Attunement of Control's changed that.
---
Yes
---
One eyed mask is already a problem and I don't want to see every titan with it. I can wait until after the mask is nerfed for him to start selling forsaken exotics.
---
We are just trying to get clan members.
---
Not best.
---
Just the must unbalanced for pvp.
---
And theyre across the board getting a massive buff with zero nerfs and their main counter. Blade is being nerfed.
---
And yet oem still hasnt even been touched. And its pathetic on the devs part because they have no excuse besides them loving the titan class.
---
U already have the ornament??....nice man
---
If you've got guns that are off-element (i.e., different from the element displayed in the collections tab), you might as well keep them as they're unique and unobtainable.
---
The item is already ‚Äúrolled‚Äù so it won‚Äôt help waiting. 
---
Are you sure it's for the ascendant challenge chests and not the 10 ascendant chests around the Dreaming City each week? 
---
Credit where credits due... that‚Äôs an incredible gambit game
---
Just regular Forsaken is what I recommend. Battle.net does not decrease the price based on what you already own. 
---
If you know what the annual pass adds and are sure you want it, you can buy the Forsaken + Annual Pass bundle. However, the annual pass has mixed reviews. The annual pass is end game only DLC for after Forsaken. 
---
Do any Y1 raid and open all of the chests that you can. Actual Engrams drop from them all of the time.
---
No you can't lose a glory streak in qp
---
I know it's just a game fam 
---
I just wanna show other people how these kids act when the win a 4v2 and then have the decency to bag 
---
Man, that's quite a read there. Can't feel but excited about this game. 
---
Lol, boohoo crybaby has to go tattle and cry on the internet because he got teabagged! What a bitch ü§£ü§£
---
My dumb ass thought it literally extended the physical length of beam this whole time...
---
Hopefully you've gotten it by now, but if not, when I had this issue, I returned to orbit and then back to Exodus Black and he spawned in. 
---
Good luck, guardian!
---
Thanks man, I got tons of things ahead of me, which is great!
---
Haven't unlocked it yet. But I intend to scream "DOCTOR OCTAGONAPUS" 
---
That‚Äôs funny. We all make mistakes and that‚Äôs something I‚Äôd definitely would‚Äôve thought XD
---
Ok good,thanks for telling me.
---
True. If you tried to switch after activation you'd be waiting on the menu to load throughout the super and the next 3 or 4 matches too.
---
Source: I'm a console player
---
it is, as long as we're in a shotgun meta
---
I got Queensbreaker, Le Monarque, One Eyed Mask and a repeat drop in 4 days and I wasn't even playing anymore than I usually do... RNG just be like that sometimes 
---
Who cares about what level someone is in crucible?
---
No just showing people who these guys are 
---
Maybe it will cleanse the community a little from these fuckboys 
---
If not whatever at least people know when they run into them in a comp match 
---
Did you use telesto or wavesplitter? 
---
I get it, just not worth stressing yourself out 
---
Cause a Lvl 2 can't even equip any good gun bro.
---
I'm not mad at him selling these forsaken exotic
---
Its just not enough. There needs to be a better, more obvious HUD info for player feedback so they can learn quicker and play better. It took me weeks to understand the nuances of Gambit because they are so discrete. But otoh sometimes it doesn't matter, I try to point out their errors (after they've died with 10+ motes) and they get mad.. even if you do it nice. They don't understand that there is a strategy to the game, which is baffling tbh. 
---
Ace, tatara gaze, and potg 
---
Trying to get mountaintop I already have the elo just need the rapid kills 
---
Yeah because its *always* a good idea to focus on newer players and not the actual fanbase. It's not like the game will lose its character, what made destiny, destiny. /s
---
Dumb Players: A Photo
---
Eh, am I stupid or how is this rule 5?
---
Nice.i got the gun and it's pretty good so it's worth the grind
---
The other guy was also pretty good. He did some work. (Not as much tho)
---
Stop crying
---
Add me ioa_superior
---
I'm at this step as well, just keep putting it off.  I'd be happy to hop in.  Amex070509 is my tag.  Send me a friend request and maybe we can hit it up on Tuesday.
---
I do not respect people boasting of something which took no effort.
---
All copies of Forsaken will give you a level 30 boost. This is used from the character select screen and brings one character up to level 30. You only get one, and it is very expensive to buy more. 
---
Keep it civil, buddy. No need to wake your inner child.
---
Lol feels bad man
---
Oh ok
---
THIS IS AMAZING
---
Pretty sure it still took some sort of effort to get it.
