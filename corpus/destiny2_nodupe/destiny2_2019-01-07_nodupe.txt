Still waiting on that link though.

That's a way of seeing things. Honestly I'm not a shotgun fan, I just carry one because the maps are tiny and it's the best (only) way to counter other shotguns. I can manage my ammo (and have for a long time), but that perk gives me some peace of mind that makes me enjoy the game more.
---

---
Maybe if I get a god roll on a shotgun maybe I'll use it, but meanwhile I'd rather have my shotgun reload on its own than get perks that give extra damage to a one-shot weapon.
---
I've given up on the crucible, and couldn't agree with you more. I'n still at 3/25
---
You sir will stay waiting. Because you obviously ignored where I said my bad I made a mistake.

Ah alright, i really dont mind that, makes them more rarer and exclusive and i like it
---
Yea I hate how everyone just melts it when there's people around. I would just damage it a little and then look around to see if anyone else is in the area before I finish him off. 
---
His ship, the Direlect, can be seen in orbit while flying into a gambit match. The area where both teams wait in the glass boxes between rounds is also on his ship. 
---
This ship, and the Drifter himself, have some pretty interesting lore that I'md recommend you google, it's pretty cool.

Put that meme out back with Ol' Yeller.

Are you playing on an Atari?

I use it whenever I know I'm gonna be fighting fallen or taken.

GENERAL REPOSTI
---
*‚ÄòGetting stomped‚Äô*
---
That's what I figured. Thanks for the answers bud
---
No we had a mix.  Does that matter?
---
Boop cannon buffs void damage more than other damage.   My fire team blew riven up with 5 bad omens.  Also gotta get armor with rocket reserves 
---
Don't have it
---
I remember this ascendant challenge. Feels like I'm in a fucking horror movie running away from Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers since these guys seem to be them. Having the offensive and defensive capabilities of an actual tank, always comes back from the dead (IF you HAVE the patience of trying to kill them [The 3 Stooges ones, not the final boss]), more relentless and bloodthirsty every time to escape them, and most importantly scaring the living shite out of you the first time doing this.
---
Yep it‚Äôs a forehead slappingly awful quest step.
---
Well, seeing the perk choices and being able to lock or unlock would actually help, but I don¬¥t wanna keep linking my Blizzard account to 3rd party apps, can everyone confirm it is legit?
---
Uhhhhhh.......
---
Can you cite your evidence for the first point please because even if is true it's likely a result of our current society rather than a natural law. But regardless, I don't think you understand what I'm saying. The point I'm making is that the reason for EA's decisions haven't been based on some SJW agenda but rather it is a result of marketing. EA knows that their base is largely white males so offering characters who aren't white or male broadens the appeal of the product. I completely agree that it historically inaccurate (as are all video games obviously) and that EA's marketing practices are insidious; all I'm trying to say is that people often think that this was some political move rather than an economic one. 
---
EA believed that this choices would get more women to buy BFV and that would outweigh whatever former customer boycotted their product which obviously ended up failing.
---
Also with that first point, I don't think that is the primary reason why girls aren't into video games. Video games have almost always been marketed to and created for boys as the consumer in mind. Our society sees video games as a boy interest and things like make up as girl interest when in reality neither sex is naturally attracted to either in particular. I think that if we could hypothetically remove all societal pressures and biases girls and boys interests would be extremely similar or even identical.

A cafe?

*one hour later in Sorik's Cut*
---
"Whaaaaaaat the fuck?!?!" 
---
Been using it since d1, it's very legit.
---
the ballistic logs are for the powerful drop versions of the frames, after that you just need modulus reports to get standard drop versions, so they'll be ~20 light or so below your stuff
---
Hmm, I certainly was to an extent during that period. Felt like they stripped away what made destiny destiny.
---
Heat transfer vinyl and a heat gun. 
---
Alternatively it‚Äôs the ‚ÄúI totally didn‚Äôt pay hundreds of dollars to get this virtual weapon just to still get shit on in quickplay‚Äù
---
What step are you on?
---
Last one
---
I‚Äôll bet you a enhancement core that I‚Äôll get none
---
Been using it since D1 too. It's the best app imo, and legit. You can lock/unlock gear with the app, but not choose perks.
---
&gt; Nothing wrong with joking about it, just pointing out that there‚Äôs unfortunately not much to differentiate between idiots being dicks and a joke, aside from the mood of whoever wants to press the up/downvote
---
It's the whole "projection" argument again tbh. People see what they want to see. 
---
Alright. I might be able to help you out.
---
It‚Äôs rough, I solo queued most of my way through it and played excessively on the double/triple exp weeks. 
---
As for tips I got into a really strong rhythm of banking 5 motes constantly making trips back and forth between areas so I never got caught out when invaders came. Then I would attack invaders aggressively to protect teammates (since for some reason everyone tries to max at 15 before banking). So many invaders freak out when they see someone running at them. Basically my biggest tip is that you can‚Äôt count on teammates to help you when you can‚Äôt communicate. So that meant matching my play style to fit every possible encounter; high dps for blockers, range weapons or linear fusions for invaders/invading, add-clearing supers over high dps supers. 
---
Good luck! It‚Äôs a grind but you can do it! Oh and when the primeval spawns position yourself near an invader spawn
---
Why hello again! Happy new year! xD
---
Uhm I watched the video and it is about how to make destiny ranking like overwatch? Lmao 
---
You are saying that match making is broken because it puts a solo alone into a game with a 4 stack? This is not true the game does not start like this. People leave the queue while the game starts and dodge, exactly how 4 stacks leave the queue and dodge and the opposing team gets a free win. We know exactly why that happens why would we assume it‚Äôs bungies fault when it happens with non four stacks?
---
Just accept you are wrong 
---
I use Bygones but pair it with a hand cannon. I use Ace but still have Luna‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt use Dust Rock period lol. I don‚Äôt have Not Forgotten because I don‚Äôt care to play with the type of people you meet 9 out of 10 times. 
---
I'd say shotgun. The boss has a decent amount of health 
---
Ok so I don't know if your a new player or not but rumble is the best way to go. Another person said it about getting better 1v1 practice as well.  Plus you should always know your scenario in each fight and whether to push or bail the heck out of there. Next I suggest watching pro players. Particularly cammycakes since he goes in depth about his choices and really help a lot of players understanding mechanics and decisions within the game.
---
Same :(
---
I have been using the duke 44 and it seems to be a good handcannon what would you recommend besides that if anything?
---
Grow up? You sound like my 7 year old.
---
From what I can tell, feeding frenzy is the same increase to reload speed. And it procs more easily.  I have it on one blast furnace pulse and outlaw on another. 
---
Maybe I'm missing something.
---
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I believe it‚Äôs a window 
---
I can pretend I‚Äôm chivalrous but if I *had* a OEM I would totally use it
---
If I could rate answers Quora style, this would be it.
---
üòÇ 
---
ohh i see, mines is currently 230, where can i find the dlc's?
---
I‚Äôd check to make sure your Xbox Live Gold hasn‚Äôt expired. 
---
My drawing is pretty bad. The arrow is supposed to be pointing to the super icon.
---
So just keep doing any of the adventures on the tangled shore?
---
I‚Äôve tried, but I must be really bad at it. 
---
Yeah I got a clan invite but haven‚Äôt seen enough people on at the same time to get a fire team together for a raid. I‚Äôve only had the game 4 days and I haven‚Äôt touched the dlc yet so I‚Äôll prob run through those see where I end up at after that. 
---
What about the crucible seal? Nobody has that yet, and that‚Äôs probably gonna be the ultimate sweat
---
Yep, everytime I pull up the map of titan, there it sits, reminding me
---
They‚Äôre just pissy cause my knuckles are tougher than their flaming knives and magic
---
"BUT NOT BEFORE I TURN YOUR HEAD INTO A CANOE, DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME"
---
I have the same roll from a powerful frame and put it to the vault so that i can infuse a good roll hammerhead cheaply.
---
If you use an arc class you can inflict arc conductor by throwing your gernade on the ground and walking onto it
---
My last two games were vs a four stack one game and then a three plus two stack the next game, most of them where using one eyed mask, but they all had either bygones, blast furnace, or ace vs all solos, but the funny part comes in when I realized that the games were both pretty close (~10-15 pts), and we probably would have crushed them if they hadn't been crutching like their collective legs were broken.
---
You are not alone brother.
---
Not from a Jedi 
---
I'm just stopping by this thread to tell you that you are so, so valid
---
Yeah what the actual hecksauce is that damage
---
Yup, my feeding frenzy kill clip blast furnace is miles better than my bygones.
---
If I see a LL, above all else I check if they have a clan. If they do, I assume they‚Äôre alts, otherwise I send them a clan invite 
---
You accidentally caught a few bullets it looks like. Lol
---
yea i ran into swarm grenade hahaa
---
Wtf I‚Äôve never seen anyone using the wavesplitter before
---
The grind is repetitive and boring. People want it over as quickly as possible for their rewards. 
---
When all there is for content is do these 3 activities 3-5 times on each char and quests like, do 40 of this activity, people are going to get them done fast. 
---
That is your simple answer.  Time. People want their rewards and they want them now.   Strikes and much of the game is no longer fun or challenging and they want 650 or more rewards. 
---
After 200k youre chances are the highest 
---
I mean they are subclasses of those abilities, but it would be nice to have an indicator available.
---
&gt; abusing it lol.
---
using it as intended is abusing now?
---
Any tips for the killing enemies in their supers?
---
Is this a D1 reference?
---
telesto is a damn good answer to the shotgun rushers
---
I think I got it from a strike
---
Are you on WiFi or Ethernet?
---
LMAO people swear they're experts on when to and not to invade.
---
Yeah, I get what you're saying. This doesn't make a huge difference unless it's comp. Not knowing whether it's a Golden Gun or a Blade Barrage that can destroy your titan bubble and anything inside is a pretty big deal when there's glory rank at stake.
---
Looks like someone is a bit behind on the internet.
---
Nope, same guardian :D  
---
Still waiting for you and Osiris tho
---
I have 3 daughters and a shop in the basement. Did you know that there is at any given moment at least 6 cute pieces of scrap wood that want to be loved?
---
It‚Äôs one of those hibachi grills where they cook the food on the table in front of you. They use a lot of oil at this one.
---
you‚Äôre not a wizard, harry. trying running at it with a luggage cart.  
---
Oh I see now. I'm not really a big comp player.
---
Nova warp??? 
---
It‚Äôs over 9000
---
Ok cool thanks. 
---
What‚Äôs it look like from your perspective?
---
Or when you queue solo and get matched against a sweaty 4 stack, 3 of your teammates leave and you bail last after 2 rounds of them teabagging and dabbing on your corpse. Yeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaahhhhh. I ruined the experience for others. It was ME. I should get the timeout. ME. 
---
Cool story right?
---
Now /r/Warframe is spreading.
---
Malfeasance if you have it. I‚Äôve knocked out a titan mid-thundercrash with it before, though granted he was just kind of flying around looking for a target. Linear fusions can also take them down in three shots. If you position yourself near an invader spawn when the primeval is up, invaders will sometimes look over you and target your teammates, which makes it a lot easier to take them down 
---
Every other time I do that special event that happens it suck. 
---
Wdym? My point is in the title...
---
Pretty much.
---
Some have 5 due to one of two different bugs triggering that first week.
---
I‚Äôm not a big fan of the competitive playlist and only ever venture there when I‚Äôm with a full squad. Anyone who gets that seal definitely has earned it though 
---
Let him rest in peace then and respect his will
---
The prospector is actually better for NF bosses if you have Arc Singe. Almost insta kills.
---
Comp? üòÇ This is me playing playlist
---
There aren‚Äôt any penalties for leaving gambit
---
Story of my life bro
---
Happened to me, jump and grab it
---
well, not exactly, hitting 10,000, 50,000, 100,000, 150,000, and 200,000 either in the run or previous runs(provided you have the NF exclusive emblem that tracks your score equipped currently) will increase your chances of getting the exclusive depending on the threshold you hit. I just got insanely lucky getting the exclusive without hitting even the first threshold
---
Nice I have feeding frenzy and kill clip 
---
Yeah they have a macro activated to do actions so they can get the completions counted towards challenges and such without being kicked for inactivity so they can go and do other stuff
---
i want luna's so goddamn bad but just have no will to go play comp and try to get precision hand cannon kills so i'm sticking with outlaw rampage trust for now
---
What a joke fuck destiny 
---
So its rng but with increasing chances?
---
But the thing is not every hunter has shards or gwisin. Worm husk was free to everyone 
---
i'm keeping them to flex on new players. "haha you'll never be able to get this ever because the dude who sells them died."
---
I like the game, this sub is just kinda toxic, like that there comment you just made, still not as bad as dtg thoüëÄ
---
Its not bad, I'm not a fan of the sights, but outlaw should help with the slow reload time, but you got kill clip with it, so its cool for pvp. Only if it had stability or range for masterwork though. 
---
it's probably a visual bug/photoshop causing the thunderlord to appear like it's taking green ammo. thunderlord did, and still does take purple bricks
---
There is a reason this sub is toxic. They made a wack ass game. 
---
Your 550 and forsaken has been out for awhile. Sounds like you finished the story and then quit without doing last wish at all. 
---
Should i slap a recoil mod on it? Or target adjust?
---
***screams in Gjallahorn***
---
be happy you got ammoes
---
Telesto= I'm on Xbox and I don't know what a wave splitter is.
---
Once you hit level 35 it‚Äôs going to be one long slog, I tried it with the titan and I couldn‚Äôt do it I got way too bored good luck I hope you make it
---
Im so happy and i love it so much it‚Äôs so good
---
Here's something to note when dealing with their taken counterparts.
---
If you see their boop attack charging then shoot their foot! You can interrupt them if you deal enough damage!
---
I learned about this a while ago when I shot at it's foot with an arrow. 
---
The regular version can also be dealt with in the same way.
---
At least they have to get kills (by closing the gap and targeting someone up close) to do that. 
---
The warlock super with its one shot kill grenades and its vague proximity win button that also has obscene roaming duration can die in a dumpster fire.
---
No you aren‚Äôt
---
he's asleep, leave the poor guy alone.
---
I am at 8/10 now. Think I can get the last 2 kills in the next few days!? Then I will try to get the ghost shell... ;-)
---
Just give me my free gear fuck sakes.
---
I know bows are an odd group but don't forget to add them to the list!
---
I like this post.
---
Petra did kill Uldren. My theory is that she had a thing for him and thought she could become Awoken Queen by marrying him. However, he rejected her and she saw it all slipping away. So she setup Uldren as killer of Cayde and then killed him so she could seize the throne. 
---
Hold up
---
You deserved it at that point

Remember no item swapping between characters on the app
---
Make love not Warcraft?
---
Oh ok. Thank you. I'm 10 Gambit matches away. 
---
Oh ok thank you. I'm 10 Gambit matches away. 
---
Yep, nailing shots from the islands is extremely satisfying.  You gotta really arc them from the other side, though.
---
Someone told me you can only do 2 in one week. I unlocked Volundr and Gofannon this week with the given frames and Ada is empty. Do ballistic logs disappear?
---
This is why we need a 6 stack of Shards Hunters. 
---
this is the ONLY exotic i dont have for my titan #feelsidontknowwhattofeelanymore
---
I did that already for my xbox version.  Its was a long and hard job but it was a great accomplishment.  getting to lvl 50 was just so boring but fun.  The story is easy at lvl 50.  only took a few hours solo.
---
Can I get uh, hazard of the cast? Legit, I just need that and to shutdown some invaders
---
Also the ace of spades you were holding in the cutscene was emptied by uldren previously.
---
OH MY GOD NOBODY HAS EVER DONE THAT
---
It is visual, happened to me with another weapon, purple bricks were still dropping
---
Thats dumb. I'll use what I want and this stupid meme isn't going to make me feel bad or like a scrub for doing so. 
---
Why does the ref look like Devrim Key as well?
---
Well many things have to be taken into account here. 1, you need to kill 20 enemies with final hits from Arc soul. You‚Äôre not always gonna be getting that final hit in any high-end pve. Pvp wise, HAHAHHAHAHAHAH. Enough said. It‚Äôs a good idea, making the neutral game of a subclass lacking it IMMENSELY better. 
---
Good PvE weapon, a bad pulse rifle for PvP. No reason to really run it imo.
---
It may not be the first time it happened, and it certainly won't be the last. But I will be one of the few brave or foolish enough to do it.
---
It could be worse imagine if it was a PS4 exclusive exotic.
---
i was a bit mad when this quest step showed up for me. forcing me to PvP and precision shots too... not fun. and i'm still trying to grind it. still a long way for me to go...
---
Haha I meant only $100 lol
---
Yeah, with the addition of Forsaken it's probably a much more tedious grind to get into the end game again. But if you've got some experience boosters and time to kill...
---
That would make it better for me since im on xbox lol
---
Both me and a friend got it after resetting valor rank. Heard others get it this way aswell.

This. I rock the Wardens Law and No Feelings. Just like to switch things up and not rely on meta weapons, the reason being that they will change and you will end up having to learn or re-learn new weapons. Neutral game is where its at!
---
I'm selecting the mission from the Director map.  Perhaps this is my problem?
---
Could be caused by your graphic card driver - try to revert to an earlier version or wait for an update. 
---
&gt;more runs that end in a failure. I've also never
---
Well if you think about it, the nightfall loot drop rate used to be weighted based on your high score on that mission. The exotic drop rate is also weighted based on what exotics you have etc. Prime engram drop rate is proven to be deterministic. EP drop rate is gradually increasing the more times you kill the final boss in the current session.  So there are a ton of examples where bungie messes around with drop rates, and it's just not simple uniform random with low chances. My observation is that when the raid came out, almost on every second run somebody got the gun, now I haven't seen 1K dropping for anybody for 3+ weeks I think, it looks really suspicious. 50 runs is truly not that much but don't forget you play with other 5 players. Since I mostly do raids on LFG I've met roughly 250 distinct players so far, so my sample is not that bad.
---
I kept all the items I had for him. Even the taken artichoke.
---
Thanks much appreciated. I‚Äôll keep an eye out 
---
Yes
---
oh god oh fuck oh please no 
---
Nice, I use the wardcliff as a meme but when i'm actually trying i'll use thunderlord. Please include colony when making the heavy version. 
---
When I am solo-queing, i don‚Äôt expect to win. It is just grinding for god roll bygones
---
It‚Äôs the most stupidly broken exotic there is. For starters, if you do damage to them they can see you through walls now. Second, if you do damage to them and then they kill you they instantly fullheal all health, shield, AND get an overshield as well. Its stupid powerful 
---
TBH this bug and their crappy netcode is what ruins much of the experience for me. I haven't been able to raid because of it. Constantly having to redo quests or milestones is so frustrating.
---
Its 2019. I don't think its too much to ask for a stable game.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Absolutely is. One is in Glacial Drift bottom left a flag/beacon just before entering the ice caves. Pull up your ghost, can‚Äôt miss it. The other should be to the left of the transmat zone when you spawn in ( I believe ) up at Braytech. 
---
Curious about the other armor bits, especially one on the right.  
---
Thx to these titans we have stepped into a war with the cabal on Mars

Damn, I usually just toss it in the general direction and expect someone else to get it in haha

Sad

:3
---
Two eyes are better than one? Jeez, i think I nearly left my body seeing this. I hope I never run into such a coordinated team 
---
I don't.
---
I honestly stopped caring. It makes no sense to try and play like a god with a team that makes so many mistakes. After 90h of Gambit I can already tell after the first enemy wave if it is going to be a win or loose, most likley.
---
I am also preparing all possible bounties for all 3 characters. So that after reaching Legend I can just pull through the 3000 infamy with completed bounties.
---
funny you say that. i've never been able to find the weapon ranking on that god forsaken website
---
You‚Äôre absolutely right, I‚Äôm used to being hyper-aggressive with my Rampage/Outlaw Bygones and OEM. Luna‚Äôs just crushes in the range I‚Äôve used and you‚Äôre right I gotta change it up on range. I‚Äôve never thought about Wishbringer, but I‚Äôll try it out thanks man
---
Thanks for the tip friend, guess my next goal is to get  THUNDERLORD now that I know its b√¶!
---
Nope and I‚Äôm a titan
---
Get fuckin jebaited
---
If your on Xbox I‚Äôll help you. 
---
As a Hunter with both, if every Hunter had access to gwisin and shards they'd both get nerfed quite quickly.

Shards allows you to easily abuse blade barrage and gwisin gives you an insane amount of super time.

If you have a solid weapon with Dragonfly, that may help with crowds too. Ace of Spades is a really great Kinetic with Firefly(same thing) on it. If you'er a Warlock and you have the Chromatic Fire exotic, you basically get double-dragonfly if you're using Ace of Spades. Until you get a thunderlord, this is a really great combo.

---
Negative!
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
Kobeet that shit?
---
if you're playing comp, why not just check the roster before you load in?
---
Im like 94% sure he's there when you first get to the tower. You could always just delete one of your characters and re-level to buy more maps
---
Yeah Hammerhead works great
---
Depending on the enemies, at least. Snipers with the same singe can One-Shot you, if the PL difference is high enough. Even with almost no difference, the hit incredible hard, if you don't take cover or don't focus them down
---
I honestly don‚Äôt remember. I got that one early on, but I would assume that I was playing with full team 
---
inconsistent! better buff range by another 5 metres. bungie get on it!
---
They are nice looking gear added to eververse. They are 10 light because bungie didn‚Äôt wanna make it like P2W in any way i guess? You just infuse it up. There‚Äôs no incentive to wear the full set 
---
Great, now my eyes have cancer.
---

---
Just farm the frames on your highest character and shove the frames into your vault and go on your other characters and badda boom badda bang
---
True, I run a sniper in my energy to pick off enemies at range 
---
Same as what everyone else is saying. Your rewards are going to come mostly from the completions. You do have a chance with any yellow bar but there are other/better ways to kill yellow bars that don‚Äôt take up time in strikes. 
---
Plus when you‚Äôve played the same strike 20 times over... today, you tend to want to get it done with as quickly as possible. 
---
I remember during D1 someone did the math on exotic drops. Your chances are so low that the time it takes to kill all the yellow bars in a strike isn‚Äôt worth it. 
---
yeah pvp its a joke but making it do more damage and have more duration in pvp in a short ammount of time/ kills it would be broken
---
I've been loving Ace since I unlocked it the firefly is great on it I love the extra solar damage too. Only thing is it's one of my lower level weapons currently, is it worth infusing it to around 550? Or is that a waste of shards?
---
what gun is that
---
Telesto users can aim mind you. We just like when we don't have to.
---
It's fair to not like PvP, but it's still a part of the game and still deserves attention and quest lines to go through it.  25 precision kills really isn't all that much.  There's plenty of PvP weapons that require PvE to earn as well, so it's not like only one side gets shit on.  Dust Rock Blues, for example, is a very competitive PvP weapon that can not be earned at all in the crucible.  Many exotics in general require PvE to earn.  The two sides of the game are still the same coin and crossovers in earning new weapons are going to happen.  Sometimes you just gotta accept that you're going to have to step out of your comfort zone to earn some loot in a game like this.
---
Curse of Osiris first, then into warmind, then forsaken.
---
There was a bug with the power handicap and it not actually changing the difficulty after a certain level but still giving the same score multiplier.
---
We‚Äôre talking about exotics, that‚Äôs a totally different convo hahaha
---
You misspelled Vex. 
---
still waiting to be a cursebreaker :(

*spams f key*
---
not all of us watch every minute of the videos bungie makes. I really enjoyed the dreaming city, thought: Yes, I would like more destiny. Was constantly assaulted by marketing for the annual pass, and read a few positive reviews of it that did NOT say it was exclusively hardcore.
---
This is really more of a marketing failure than anything else, except that activision would hardly put out marketing saying "ONLY BUY THIS IF YOU'RE TOTALLY HARDCORE GUYS" as activision has been unhappy with forsakens performance and wants greater engagement with the initial destiny 2 community. Hence, the current situation.
---
I just got my Luna's and the first day of playing with it got me an extra 400ish glory and 12% of kills done with it.  I'm pretty happy with the quest for it, I like a challenge for a weapon that you really have to earn to use.
---
I always bank 5 motes back to back to back so I don‚Äôt get caught out when invaders come. Since you can‚Äôt rely on your teammates as much when solo queueing I would always then make sure to clear blockers consistently. When invaders do come I rush them, which is really effective against most players. Also I normally set my load out with a scout or linear fusion in case I‚Äôm the one invading. 
---
You really can‚Äôt control what other players do regardless of how much you try to help them, but making things easier for them seemed to help a lot.

Vandals + Arc Singe 
---
And many more....Sometimes, I would rather play them without singe as some enemy-types are just too frustrating to fight against with a certsin singe...
---
oem abuse. 
---
From doing the Overlay utility in game, it is showing the speed of the GPU and the memory to be stock  
---
Even though in AORUS I have set the GPU to +100 and memory to either +25 or +50  
---
I just went into the game and set everything to the lowest it would go or off, and still the FPS topped at 14  
---
I went into Radeon Settings and set them according to this guys recommendation and then rebooted, this was just Radeon Settings, not the other settings he suggests.

I actually haven't been using my void subclass on my hunter as much as I should have, i've been neglecting it more for solar atm. Thanks for the tips! I definitely need to get my hands on Graviton Forfeit ASAP &amp; read up on more helpful exotics. Cheers
---
Ok, it's more clear now, thank you !
---
Should I do all the strikes in the older world's or just focus on DLC content and hitting level cap?
---
Dude, spoilers.
---
Void Hunter has some of the best PvE Sub-Classes in the game, with certain exotics. You should definitly do a little research on them :D
---
Jesus, 75 consecutive glory wins. 
---
Alright. I sent you a message, just message me whenever
---
I understand that Destiny is a big game with much more than PvP and even in PvP there's a lot of game modes that people will be playing. I agree that some concessions must be made in a game like to Destiny to keep queue times down. However I personally disagree that this is the best compromise that could be me. I personally would prefer a longer queue time for a more balanced PvP game (perhaps that's just competitive but after some bad experiences in Overwatch I've been tending to avoid competitive modes in games). If that is done I would consider allowing the player to continue to play in the world so its not just a loading screen for however long.
---
You are right in that you can't please everyone and someone is always going to be unhappy. But I don't think this is the best we can do. I expect to get stomped a good bit in PvP but I don't expect to get stomped literally 80% of the time. 
---
No I already payed for it years ago lol not paying for it again. 
---
Well that's the thing, you wouldn't need to since it's optional old content. 
---
Yea just about all of my friends loath playing anything PvP because of this. The sad thing is I'm getting a sense that people are just accepting this is the way things are and may as well just deal with it cause it's the best that can be done. 
---
There's always a silver lining somewhere :p
---
Pretty sure that was fixed since this week or the previous week. It's definitely dropping my LL down to 540 regardless. Either way I can still solo Wardens, but it's really tough. Every LL matters, though, so having an underpowered Bite of the Fox was hindering me quite a bit until(leaving me at 533) I bumped it up to 650. 
---
Get gud 
---
No Queensbreaker 0/10 sweat try again
---
I'm not even particularly bothered by those if I'm being honest. I mean if you got em use em. But they definitely don't help 
---
They‚Äôre purely for the aesthetic. If you happen to think they look really cool and/or if you get really decent rolls on them then it‚Äôs worth it to infuse them up and masterwork them but otherwise I usually just stick them in the vault. 
---
Like any other set (besides the dreaming city for a few triumphs/rare bounties), there‚Äôs no benefit to wearing the whole thing besides just appreciating the completed look. 
---
Ous rather they put their resources into new stuff. 
---
no u
---
Oh hell yeah. It's NEVER a waste to infuse that thing. It's a super good HC for so many reasons. 
---
No you both
---
You've made it to the dreaming city and done everything there?
---
focus on dlc content, you'll do all the strikes in the Ace of Spades questline anyway.
---
Thanks for including the context on why this is funny.
---
Right on
---
Yea same here..  Missing Horrors Least, Silver Tercel and Pallas Galliot.. I hope i get them this week, at least one of them.. 
---
Just another "1 year in 5 minutes video"
---
Actually if you go into comp trying to shoulder charge everyone you're going to die
---
&gt;You do have to aim
---
good one lmao
---
It is just so much fun in pve
---
I feel your pain 
---
I do get wrecked by Luna every so often, but my last match of the night yesterday was me (novabomb lock), a hunter with shards, and four titans with one eyed mask. Lost 68 to 15 or some such.
---
One eyed must not be that great of a crutch.
---
If you're on PS4 you can change your console time and date, this makes the game put you in Servers solo easy kill :))
---
I wonder what percentage Main Ingredient is...
---
Reddit. The only place where you can go from video games to music.
---
Hmm looks awefully familiar, but I don‚Äôt miss my shots. I just hit the wrong things. 
---
i really think it was op af, before 180rof were introduced and gotten popular. 
---
it was my go to weapon along with the wormhusk. I won too many 1v2 EZ.but maybe ure right not that op, but think abt it, what was actually op in season1-3? graviton/antiope meta? what else? nothing
---
I feel like you couldve found a decent destiny image to go with the caption, but instead you got a stock image of some girl laughing at her early 2000‚Äôs laptop
---
Well of radiance, the new solar super in forsaken
---
I start every match with a hand cannon and shotgun. After gong 0-5 I quickly equip my bygones and auto rifle to keep my kd. I'm not meta
---
The well is what you're looking for spect it out out and you'll have it 
---
Fortunately we live together, so we both know we suck at PvP. 
---
What your talking about is well of radience. Its the dawnblade super that was added in forsaken, you can unlock it by getting a seed of light from the blind well
---
I use trust because I got a roll i like on it. (Opening shot and explosive payload). Granted I have Luna and I‚Äôm not good with ace....
---
this image is the kinda shit i have nightmares about
---
How is that worse lol? That just means two entire platforms wouldn't have to deal with that shit. Good riddance.
---
"Little Light"
---
Damn. You got us there. 
---
Ok now you officially took it to far buddy 
---
thanks for the info..  i'll definitely give it a try.
---
Have put tonnes of hours into Destiny and Destiny 2. Don't even really care anymore 
---
Wormhusk used to be meta but I dont think its nearly as overtuned as oem
---
It's based on an advertisement for a mobile game.
---
That is just factually incorrect. The perk for oem, Been has the definition "Marks the enemy that dares to damage you. Track down and destroy your enemy for increased ***damage*** and overshield" 
---
"it means so much that you even pay attention at all"
---
jesus christ....
---
Yup
---
This happens to me constantly! I find myself feeling less and less wanting to play if everytime I play gambit I get disconnected and the same warning. There needs to be a system that registers players that actually left and ones that have connection issues. 
---
LOLZ
---
No one said anything about creating it for free. Hence the "pay for" title. 
---
PC players would absolutely dominate console players in PvP. Don‚Äôt think it would happen for thus reason
---
The on eyed mask is the same as that. No everyone has it. 
---
You know what happens when I (a Titan with OEM) get teamed up against another one (with OEM) as well?
---
Let's not talk about that. A lot of Guardians died. 
---
Activision have enough resources. 
---
They should add that to vesper of radius
---
Yes, I would love that, I often went back to old locations and soloing them in most MMO's. 
---
we wanted it or not
---
I had too, after the first expansion, I love destiny, a lot, but I felt like the massive lack of content was ruining it, and I really missed the locations for D1. I recently bought the complete edition though and I'm loving it again, I hope there's a lot more to do now. 
---
Duke Mk.44 squad where you at
---
chaperone is the lie. terrible in air for apeing.
---
Countdown. Im fine with survival.
---
Spoopy
---
Some of us got unlucky and the invader either canped with sleeper or popped a super every damn time 
---
I thought the whole point of changing up the weapon slots was to increase build diversity.  Instead you get this.
---
You got backhanded like a common whore.
---
Nobody wants sidearms.
---
It‚Äôs technically an old meme but it‚Äôs the first thing that popped into my mind
---
Likewise, just got mine from daddi shax
---
One time, me and clan mates, are in the last wish. We entered the door when you first fly in from orbit and just like that, we were jumping and next thing I saw on my screen was that same thing
---
[Light.gg](https://Light.gg) and the either a filter for that perk or "God Roll Finder" will tell you if it's available. That being said, I could have sworn I had a RL with Slideshot on it before. 
---
sure you can, you inspect the people you're up against and look at their subclass block before the match starts...
---
Try nVidia GeFroce Now Beta if your internet is not too bad...
---
And sorry for the sparrow ;)
---
Very good form though
---
As a former chattering bones user, absolutely.
---
Honestly I‚Äôll probably get truth to power before dreaming city 
---
Oh great ideia dude :O totaly forgot the vesper 
---
You got straight shield-bashed. If you slow it down immensely(to .125 speed or so), you can see your shots hit, do nothing, and a shield bash occur almost at the same millisecond. 
---
This is so accurate. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: eliminate all quest steps and triumphs except winning the OBJECTIVE. 
---
As long as pc players aren‚Äôt anywhere near a console server idc if it happens. I just want to avoid m/kB being on console.  D2 already has some xim/cronos issues and I don‚Äôt want to make it worse.
---
I have Breakneck and several Army of One achievements. But I've only killed 2 invaders with their super active. 
---
Especially during SOTP. Ever look at the Servitor inside the boss before starting the Vault Access phase of final boss phase? If you have, have you ever shot it? If you haven't, I can recommend doing so üòâüëå
---
I have a hard time understanding in-game lore and following along with the little bits here and there.  This does a good job of putting it together.
---
Usually for me it is, "Fuck I hate this bounty to bank larger blockers, this shit sucks but I need the rewards, awe shit here come the Queensbr-"  but the number one thing that goes through my mind is a bullet. 
---
Its 180rpm hand cannon and if you hit two presicon shots magnificent howl props and you can 3 tap. Usually it takes 4 headshots to kill some one whit that kind of weapon so thats why its one of the fastest killing guns
---
Wait there‚Äôs destiny imessage stickers? How do i get them
---
Helpful hint(if you have phone üòÇ)With the destiny 2 companion app you can just move gear between characters while in game. Saves time of loading into tower to get to vault. 
---
I just did the same and reset, got the last 3k points it took me over a week. I had to get most of the points from bounties
---
It's the only thing strong enough to withstand the might of my creation. 
---
Just wait for thorn+oem... 
---
You need the app then it's pretty self explanatory
---
It was pretty funny actually
---
I guess I'm a level 10 hitman forever.
---
What is on the curated roll? That's the Threat Level, right?
---
Is the annual pass worth it for PvE players?
---
I looked through most of the newer ones and didn't see any that could roll it
---
https://www.light.gg/db/category/1?etc=weapons&amp;page=1&amp;f=9%2813%29
---
Ahh, gotcha. I really like 180rpm (Malfeasance, Trust) but Malfeasance isn't the best for Crucible and I've only had two mediocre Trust rolls.
---
The thumbnail kinda spoils it. Good meme though 
---
Wow man, that‚Äôs very specific and must be true lol. I just like the fact that I have 113 rounds in the mag after a reload
---
I didn't think you could view captures from the app last I checked
---
Square up 1v1 me then
---
Thanks now I‚Äôm gonna have nightmares :(
---
Scullfort striker is definitely better. I‚Äôd say feedbacks are also better than synths for pvp. They are best suited for pve. But still viable. 
---
Titan since I'm not particularly fast like a hunter and have no idea what to do with knives. Also magic would probably confuse me lol so no warlock.
---
So you are an angry teenager? 
---
The campaign will not tell you everything. If you want to really get into the story then read the lore cards in your collection. If you don‚Äôt want to wait until you unlock all of those then I‚Äôd suggest looking on Ishtar collective or going to YouTube and watching MynameisByf. And no Ada-1 is actually a friendly (I use that word liberally) NPC that is apart of the newest content drop. 
---
As for the factions well, it‚Äôs not like there is ever just ONE enemy in most situations. I personally like the nuance of the factions and the fact that they aren‚Äôt all on the same side just because they hate you, they also hate each other too. 
---
Not even close but I will be if that‚Äôs what gets you off daddy
---
Dont get so heated over a shitpost.
---
Sarah is great, Chump on the right cherry picked all his fights to get his record. 
---
Haha then you definitely need to stop acting like one and grow up
---
I dont play with trash and people who think this game was made only for them are trash.
---
I use Chattering Bone, Badlander/Tatara and QB. 
---
Youre the one who needs to grow up 1v1 me like a man if you have so much to say
---
Post name?
---
Sad... got Forsaken on Dec 25.... but after a few days (like a week) there was Forsanken+AnualPass at the same price that Forsaken was earlier... I got really really sad about that :( 
---
lol makes sense
---
You‚Äôre the one who needs to man up 1v1 me grow up boy
---
Isn't that like what kids used to do in elementary school? Triple dog dare 1v1 me! 
---
Oh dear, I‚Äôm very sad I‚Äôm not on ps4, because I would like nothing more than to take your .92 kd and put you into a hole of your own to teach you a lesson you mouthy brat 
---
It‚Äôs been happening so far today as well. Think I‚Äôm just going to pass on the forges.
---
I‚Äôll go buy an Xbox today bitch square up
---
I don't think I'm ever going to get those Competitive handcannon final blows. At this point I just privately whisper "sorry" to my team when the opening standoff scene loads.
---
As a hunter main I honestly think I would b a titan because I find myself often too prideful, headstrong, and stubborn. Lol
---
Nope, but I was not aware there was so much content there. Again, I just needed some direction to content after finishing the campaigns. Thanks!
---
As a titan main....this makes me so proud.
---
(I'm not crying, you're crying)
---
The fact you are playing hunter proves that hahah
---
Thanks!
---
Thanks for the info
---
You can one shot melee with synthoceps! They are great for both pve and pvp, but i would go bubble tree with synth.
---
Hope this helps!
---
Please tag NSFW
---
You're a waste of time.
---
Set is based on the legendary Warlock Ulan Tan.  It looks sick.
---
I got Feeding Frenzy and Rampage on an Avalanche.  It's pretty cool.
---
weird flex but okay
---
The grind is over!
---
Mega man yeaaaaaaaaaaa
---
*FLY! MELT! LIIIIIIVE!*
---
I don't think they show as complete in collections. 
---
All else fails, set your system clock back. You shouldn‚Äôt match make with anyone
---
Once you upgrade a weapon frame and forge it, the next time you go to forge it again, you don't have to do the entire "frame upgrading quest."  You just have to do multi-kills, and radiant seeds.
---
Kobeee
---
True
---
Since Destiny uses P2P, you'd need a separate ping for every player in the game, plus the servers.
---
Thank you!
---
Compared with having none (like most games...) special snipers still get a shit ton to the point that I don't think it's worth pointing out.
---
People who can't admit that are just plain chicken. 
---
The only trash I see is your nasty ass food containers. 
---
Or... When you get matched against 4 OEM titans with shotguns in comp pvp.
---
Signed. 
---
A  nerf for PvP.  And a buff for PvE.
---
Approved. Welcome to the revolution.
---
Is there any chance you still have multiple rare bounties held on a single character and can provide a screenshot as proof?  You are the only person so far that has claimed this so far, that I could find.  I have yet to receive a second rare bounty on any of my characters if the first one is still active.  Thanks!
---
A petition for you to shut up ...jk is it still the meta right now? I have been getting destroyed by Luna's and not forgotten. 
---
Wait, how is that a buff to pve?
---
I find these posts funny, because I play on PC with controller all the time and I do pretty well at pvp. Almost always in the top 3 of my team at least.
---
this happened to me yesterday as well, in several different situations. It wasnt just the blockers, random ads would just 1 hit me with a melee, but not animation would go off
---
Think about what you just said. Enemies are usually dead before the explosion. That means the gun is powerful enough to kill enemies even without the explosion. And the explosion isn't like Firefly so it's not like you're missing out on some big explosion that causes splash damage to surrounding enemies. It only hurts the enemy the rounds are stuck to. But you always get the explosion on all enemies over a red bar.
---
That's not even talking about how quick it fires for a handcannon while also being incredibly stable, accurate, and having a high ammo capacity. Like 14 rounds per clip. All of that is insane for a handcannon.
---
But hey, if people are upset because red-bar enemies die before the explosion kills them then that's on them, even though that's a completely stupid reason not to like it.
---
Well yeah üòÇ
---
It rounds up.
---
It's still at 99.something, get another kill or 2 and it will complete. Happens all the time 
---
Quite
---
Not really it‚Äôs just a rush and slide with a bit of map awareness. I‚Äôm not an amazing PvPer and have shit roll shotguns but it‚Äôs easy to rack up shotgun kills anyway, particularly on Titan. 
---
Worst thing is it‚Äôs pretty much no fun (except for maybe beating other shotgun rushers in a reaction test)
---
Definitely look to get your light level up a bit. I know they're tagged at light 610, but the moment you amp up to the second level of the Forge, those mobs become about 620ish. It's significantly easier once you're there or higher. 
---
You may have 199/200 points so it is rounding 99.5% up to 100%. It happens.
---
&gt;If crucible got you down, go do some gambit
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Crimson + One-Eyed Mask. 
---
#Oh no. 
---
got em
---
So reposts don‚Äôt steal it
---
You may have thousands of matches but if you still have a problem dealing with telesto, especially if you‚Äôre not a shotgunner, then you obviously still have stuff to learn. Putting telesto in heavy is a bad idea but others have already explained why so I won‚Äôt bother to repeat. 
---
The meta and what is fun is all a matter of opinion, but early crucible days when ARs were king were pretty boring imo, and that was a huge complaint for a large portion of the player base, so you‚Äôre probably in the minority. 
---
Meanwhile, bygones/Graviton/cluster rocket.
---
Hey now, I turn 50 this month and just started playing Destiny 2 in November.  My Warlock is 594, Hunter is 571, and Titan is level 37 with PL of 445. I'll be ready for Last wish soon.
---
Bruh if you ever shoot oem you doing something wrong lol 
---
Make sure you form a strong, emotional bond to Cayde-6
---
Seems like lots of easier completes this week with the big 'ol Bok Litur boss. Usually a hunter would drop a teather or a warlock would do well of ridiance, a million orbs would appear, and one or two chaos reach warlocks would burn him down with repeaded supers. I don't think I saw a single boss fail. I did about a dozen completes with random dudes and I picked up the last of my Ikelos guns, the subgun.
---
The week before with Naksud, the Famine was a nightmare. Those stupid explodie guys that kept healing him were frustrating. That's where I ground out my shotgun over christmas break... Lots of boss fails with him.
---
i have the first ones but not forsaken will i be able to play?
---
On the strongest curse week when you go into the queens court from giving the offering to the oracle you will get the 3rd seed of light.
---
well of radiance?
---
I got the thunderlord as a random drop a day after mentioning it to my clan
---
That's a lot of wells. Lol
---
Crimson is your friend I  the crucible. That's how I got my kills
---
Claus is getting angry!
---
&gt;some one shot scout rifle on us or some shit
---
The scout rifle from Scourge can roll with box breathing. It makes it so you can annihilate people from a mile away as fast as NF/Luna
---
Oh right. When‚Äôs the strongest curse week?
---
Plus Lunafaction!
---
5 in total, I got 1 in one game then 4 in the next one after that. Then I was talking with my clan and found out how hard it was to get cause I was the only one who had it done. 
---
Tomorrow after reset i believe
---
Fair enough
---
From a quick google aearch it should be on reset tomorrow. Emphasis on should, i could be wrong.
---
Edit: pulled that from the calendar from the link on this site: https://gamerant.com/destiny-2-calendar-track-every-weekly-event-loot-drop/
---
I think I gotta it figured out  
---
Had to do a lot of playing, but the Wattman feature wasn't working quite right, and it would not allow the card to ramp up the speed of the GPU and Memory  
---
But I had to down clock both, because once the game started running and memory and GPU speeds topped out at default, the system would crash and reboot.  
---
So I down clocked GPU to 1149 (default 1224) and memory to 1500 (Default is 1750).  
---
So I am wondering if I need a bigger power supply?? I thought it was a 400W, but maybe it isn't or it is, and I just need a 450 or 500W  
---
My God, you really went there? You know I said primary in place of kinetic.
---
On one hand, THIS IS SO TRUE.  On the other hand, Gambit is exactly the right place for this.
---
The Drifter wants you to understand that sometimes you've just got to screw your team over for selfish reasons.
---
Embrace The Darkness, OP.
---
I meant this but not sure I explained that well. Thank goodness, cause those chains are no joke. 
---
yep much harder that way considering they know where you are, probably have heavy, and/or a super ready to go.  Also pretty easy for your teammates to steal the kill, pretty sure you needed the final blow with a handcannon for that step. 
---
Its simply 'ultimate'. Which is called like this in most games I have played. They're usually the 'really strong' powers that need to be charged and have a massive effect in the gameplay. Its just a term.
---
I‚Äôm just glad we don‚Äôt get messages about aimbot because it doesn‚Äôt exist 
---
Oh god oh fuck
---
I only use triple jump.
---
Me too buddy, me too. 
---
It also carries me through pve like the solo nightfall I did last week and am doing rn
---
I have over 1k hours. 800 dedicated to titan. 
---
Yeah but that‚Äôs so overdone 
---
Says the guy using aimbot
---
Lol 
---
Lol ‚Äúright‚Äù
---
JORDAN!
---
Only 8 more matches for me....
---
Looks at Frostbolt's Stats. Looks at TV's Stats. Cries.
---
You still did good though dished out more damage than anyone else
---
What makes you think that lol
---
Fireteam medallion only increases xp gains for 4 hours. 
---
A giant hammer is probably how I would have done it
---
I had a match against a six stack all spectral blade gwisin hunters with six rat kings. We still won tho.
---
Pay homage to Cayde and get the weapon.
---
PS4? I just looked it up on Destiny tracker and that was the only one I found. Seems pretty weird, though.
---
Why you calling out my mans like that ? 
---
/s
---
Patch notes from a few weeks ago said the seed of light was added to tier 4. 
---
Still looks better than some teammates I‚Äôve had while grinding lunas howl
---
Stop fucking commenting on my crap, if you don‚Äôt like it just downvote and move on. 
---
At launch of forsaken you had to kill the guy invading, on your side of gambit, 5 times. The issue was that the invaders usually come with heavy, and get an overshield, so getting these kills was very difficult and ultimately depended on the invader being an absolute dunce, and even then you only get a very limited number of chances in each game to do this. It was bad, but not as bad as the lunas quest.
---
thats not too bad
---
That's a nice controller you have there Johnny, would be a shame if something were to happen to it.
---
Are you are fucking roleplayer???
---
The TTK is absurd and can't be outgunned when a decent player is using it. I'm dying to get it, as I'm pretty happy with my performance in Crucible and know this gun would be ridiculous when I get used to it. Definitely gonna be worth the grind.
---
Thanks for believing in me. You give me faith.
---
That does sound pretty monstrous.
---
Thanks for the full explanation, makes more sense now.
---
Lmaooo
---
Crooked is hella good but a tad harder to use than QB. 
---
For the record I use baligant, le monarche, crooked.
---
A little off-topic, but how do some people feel about some Y1 weapons like Dire Promise (Dead Orbit hand cannon), Inaugural Address (Leviathan pulse rifle; still my favorite pulse rifle), and Play of the Game? Or even old-meta like masterwork Graviton Lance/Vigilance Wing, Colony, etc etc?
---
Thanks...I think...
---
There's a community discord for LFG. Check the clan recruitment channel! 
---
I love all those guns and they still feel so great to use...I've just recently gotten Forsaken though and right now I've just been trying out all the Forsaken guns I've received along with adjusting to the Crucible's current meta. Still don't have the Colony though
---
Sometimes i feel bad about mercing people thoüòÇ a part of my soul dies when i kill someone with more than 10 motes
---
I thought Bungie have been enjoying their Christmas for the past two weeks? 
---
We were getting feed back prior to the holidays, there has been an expected pause and now I‚Äôm expecting everything to kick off again after this week. Let‚Äôs just hold out for their first ‚Äònews blast‚Äô this week. 
---
Fire team medallions only increase xp gain

Your people needed you so he was taking you there
