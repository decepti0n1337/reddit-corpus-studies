Also same for gambit. Had games this week I couldn’t get out of in orbit. I blame console mod times. Seems to take a few seconds for the dismiss interface to come up and by that time the game is confirmed and launches. 
---
---
---
Wait what? I think its time you leave this post as all you're doing now is giving me a good laugh about your idiocy.
---
With fortnight and Apex Legends, I think Destiny needs to improve their game and especially make quick updates. 
---
It can't kill Destiny if it kills itself with its garbage end game and bland story, flying is fun but too many enemies have fire abilies and force you to fight on the ground, it's a joke of a game
---
XD why is titan titan , warlock warlock but hunter is jäger
---
I got the Queenbreaker and lots more from PvP and gambit do good luck
---
Best idea ever. 
---
I still dont really see the point in being able to go invis if people can still see you in PvP and enemies still spam fire wherever you last we're before you go invis(half the time resulting in you dying if you're going invis to try and get out of a risky situation) in pve. The only time I've ever used it is for resing a teammate
---
To recap the numerous explanations in the comments, CammyCakes is:
---
Destiny 2 YouTuber
---
God
---
A Wizard
---
And never gets mad
---
Unless you count that video a while back where he just gets super triggered by a teabagger. 
---
This happened to me but didn’t know what it meant...
---
Nah... he still kept his cool there
---
ive posted in the crucible forums on here a few times just to have my opinion get shut down and called an idiot..
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
when you guys talk about cammy you praise him like hes the best 
---
kina ironic that ive played him and beat him in rumble a few times... winning most engagements against him
---
but remember im trash low skill, idiot that doesn't understand the game... but ive literally shit on the man you praise multiple times
---
guess when your not main stream and have a higher level opinion on something about game balance youre just considered an idiot because someone of a lesser skill doesn't agree with you..
---
I literally just got all the proof I need from the dick riding... tells me I know more than the majority does 
---
I didn’t know it was a PS4 exclusive but thanks! 
---
Does Monday sound all right?
---
use core terminus at anna, you can sparrow through the sector all the way to the boss. he takes 3\~ heavy sword strikes to kill, drops 10 and a shortcut door opens when the rooms clear. takes all of 2 mins to do.
---
Nah. If you think you can hide your absence of arguments behind joke and leave, u probably should find another thread. 
---
I don’t mind going up against a 4 stack in comp when soloing. It makes it a more intense game and makes beating them more satisfying if a team of randoms beat a co-ordinated 4 stack. I’d rather have an intense game than an easy win honestly. 
---
Virtually yes. But there is an actual achievement for unlocking a Seal title. You will see those on the bottom of the Triumphs tab. Most people get Wayfarer done first as it just takes weekly game play really and not TOO much RnG.
---
I posted when I hit 650 on all three, but that was back on 12/23/18 and feel it was a more valid post back then...
---
I agree tbh. I solo que a lot and I haven’t ever avoided matching teams. 
---
Maybe we should stop calling games "\_\_\_\_ killers"? Maybe? It's almost like you can play more than One (1) Video Game
---
lel @ removed post.
---
pretty sure you could pull it out of collections at a higher light level but i don't think you can get it to 650 since you can't infuse it
---
I dont know the exact location but I saw a series of cliffs that looked like they could be jumped up. I did, the saw I couldnt get anywhere else. Turned around and saw a cave on the cliff where I was that you wouldnt have been able to see without getting to where I was. I jumped to it and went in and found nothing. Turned around to leave and saw in the corner a little black cat, walked up to it and got a gift prompt. Did so and got a dreaming city piece.
---
Lmao I thought that was an actual thing but then I realized the HP reference 
---
You know, it turns out Destiny wasn't the first or only shooter to have quests and loot.
---
&gt; And now they have the freedom to take the game where they want. 
---
And they were stopped before? Source on Activision saying they couldn't release more raids or storyline or certain parts of lore?
---
Also those who created the two greatest franchises many of them are gone.
---
I am not saying Destiny 2 is bad I am saying it is good game and why I don't see it getting remarkably better like you seem to think. 
---
Time to get better internet
---
It's like an old WoW Alliance zerg.
---
There is no light here, unless you've brought it with you
---
this is true.. however but this also shouldn't be used as a cop out for him to get away with getting dunked on
---
As iconic as Diablo and Borderlands are, and as much as they did trailblaze this genre Destiny occupies-
---
Destiny is THE looter-shooter right now. Until Borderlands and Diablo release a new game (not on mobile) that is successful, Destiny is the current definitive looter-shooter (you could argue The Division is, but Destiny is far more accessible and has loads more players).
---
So it boggles my mind that when a new looter shows up, they fail to realize that their demographic is the Destiny fan base mainly. Anyone that is even remotely interested in Anthem is more than likely already playing Destiny or The Division. So Anthem should do everything that it’s competition does, but better, plus more.
---
These games require a lot of time, effort and dedication. If you want to win me over, you need to convince me you’re worth leaving my current game. Yes, you can play multiple games, of course. But unless you’re a full time streamer, you can’t really play multiple looter-shooters seriously and hardcore at the same time. I won’t buy your game is you aren’t doing everything my current game does, and then some. If you can release a game and say “This is 100% better than our competition” in almost every aspect, at least in this genre, then you need to go back to the drawing board.
---
I thought this was a legendary and an exotic until I read the comments.
---
I have about 100mbps down and up, so I don't think that's the problem. As well I wasn't having this problem about a month ago. 
---
But battle royal Halo?
---
Awesome man!
---
We know the mechanics but can't do them perfectly. We mess up and can recover, but it becomes much harder.
---
Why are people so mad when things do exactly what they are supposed to do
---
PVP restrictions...fireteam of 6 or solo only. Who am I kidding bungie wouldnt be able to match a 6stack vs a 6stack anyway.
---
People downvoting you are quite stupid.
---
Play the crucible game modes on the left side until you have reached the maximum valor rank. Then you can hover over the crucible and hold a button (it will tell you which one, on PC I think it's either E or F but don't remember). This resets your valor rank back to 0 so that you can earn rank up rewards again. It is possible to get the Chaperone quest to drop without doing this, but resetting your valor rank seems to guarantee it. 
---
Not a huge spoiler. Literally the first mission. 
---
Destiny 1 was to include more cars than it did but the PS3 and Xbox 360 stoped it 
---
Destiny 2 there is 1 or 2 cars per zone on earths and mars 
---
I can firmly say I have one of these
---
Good luck my friend, this was inspirational, people like you make this game what it is! 
---
Seen this before, alot of people clickbait streams to draw in viewers, comments and potential subscribers. Best you ignore them or report the worst clickbaiting ones (i,e a regular destiny stream with nothing to do with xur at all)  
---
He lost a game on stream earlier and was the happiest I’ve ever seen him
---
I dont think his ever play D1 or D2 so yea, it kinda is.
---
Holy shit, well timed
---
Oh he gets mad, he just doesn't post it on videos. 
---
My clan has matched him many a time and absolutely stomped him, and he'll send some *salty* whispers. 
---
Expected more from him the first time I matched him, and was definitely disappointed lol
---
But collections
---
Ah, yeah, the only advantage it gives you is that you're more blury, maybe harder to hit crits or invisible if you're sniping from across the map on maybe one of the 2 maps you can do that on
---
Ah good point. 
---
Thanks. My game is currently downloading right now.
---
Should i use the booster that comes with it or just start from level 0?
---
I can’t, it sucks!
---
Meh i usually stay... beat so mant 4 stacks and 6 stacks its not even funny even in gambit .... just cause its a group does not mean they are good 
---
It kills fast and does AOE damage on kill = Great clear overall
---
Did the same with last wish and 1k voices. But I joined a riven cheese lobby instead
---
Also no guarentee they are good just cause they 4 stack
---
*Sounds of Titan skating*
---
OH SHIIIIIIIIIII-
---
I think he added that right before I posted my comment or Im blind and didnt see it either.
---
Ok sorry not everyone can be an elite gaming specimen god like you and your friends lol piss off
---
Rumble exists. Tell Bungie we like it. That might not be true, but at least they’ll stay on task
---
WAAPOWWWWWWWW
---
Booster will take you directly to Forsaken. I’d run the base game if I were you. Gives you a feel for the characters, and you’ll learn how to use your character at an easier pace. 
---
Don't worry Bungie will never revive the factions for whatever reason.
---
I wouldn't mind seeing white and greens still, as long as there is an auto dismantle option and they dont take away from other potential drops.
---
I know but if it wasn’t optional people would still find some way to complain about it 
---
Start from level 0 with your first guy. Experience the game. Then boost your second or third character :)
---
Just remember you dont need to complete all weekly tasks, it's fine to miss or skip them if you dont want to do it. I burned myself out trying to get every daily and weekly task done every single day.
---
Maybe try the lfg?
---
Cheers. Thought it was but wasn't too sure. Just thought the arrow looked pretty clean lol.
---
Ikora:Am I a joke to you?
---
Why bother changing your mind? Your opinion is incredibly stupid.
---
You can hear them screaming #SPREAD DAMMIT! 
---
I hear the load times alone for anthem will make it a non starter
---
I agree that  that is true and can completely nullify everything I have said. Again I agree with you. But those weapons are some of the best in the game and I'm sure that using the LH/NF feels great.
---
You can also nullify what I said with people think that what I use is annoying and stuff.
---
There is no perfect answer to this. 
---
I understand that. I just have to hope that the thise who do use that loadout and enjoy it after the weeks and months of grinding will understand that people not everyone will be as good as them. I mean, that's how they got it in the first place, they beat all those not as good as them.
---
Personally it feels like they just want to stomp me for their kd and ruin mine. I know that is not the case and they just want to use what they've earned, but it is kind of what it feels like. Again this is all Personal Opinion.
---
Dude I hv been hunting this forever.
---
Nice one though 👌😉
---
I'm so envious.
---
I've done each Ascendant Challenge 3x a week, every week so far, and still no ghost shell. 
---
I just started leveling my warlock and there wasn't a single green engrams. Just white, brown, blue. 
---
How do groups of four do the baths? Don't you need all 5 plates to be stood on at the same time?
---
Just greens, in D2 they just stop dropping at a certain level.
---
I got Black Talon grinding out Bergusia a couple days ago, but I’m not a sword dude so feelsbadman
---
He has outlaw and rampage. Feeding frenzy is only marginally better than outlaw. 
---
Hahaha sounds about right
---
oh you right, mixed up the kill clip icon lol
---
feeding frenzy is def a lot better though. still worth.
---
I literally don't even know what an edgelord is.. and I got people who use this type of shit in their vocabulary against me as in insult... no wonder
---
Good thing i started when year 2 came
---
For me you could throw a purple engram in there. “Enhanced” perks might not do much but I 100% choose them over other loot so basically 90% of all drops are unimportant to me. I even dismantle prime engrams because I just don’t care. 
---
Blasted Cabal drill
---
exactly, the issue isn't so much the length as it is that you can't do anything while it's happening. In Destiny you can inspect your character, inventory, triumphs, even switch and tweak loadouts. The waiting doesn't feel like waiting at all because you can still be active. Anthem you just look at a graphic and watch a bar move.
---
Crucible is garbage. There is absolutely no balance. Bungie can make good pvp shooters but in this case they didn't. The Crucible maps have a bizarre 2 lane map structure that doesn't really work like it should and the objectives can be in pretty unfortunate spots. It is basically imposible to do damage with anything less than a scout rifle at mid range or a shotgun at melee range, revolvers are ok but unreliable and auto rifles are are completely pointless. Grenadeing people is almost imposible due to the amount of advanced movement all of the guardians have. This game also does not account for the guardians abilities, basically the Titan is king and the Hunter is his bitch and don't even try to play Warlock. The Titan can roughly one shot most characters with his melee, this would be fine if there was a substantial penalty for missing. Hunters can back to back other Guardians with melee swings. The Warlock just gets his shit pushed in when he tries to melee. The Warlock is the weakest class but has no way of countering any weakness he has. Hunters at least can use bows and their movement speed to help their relatively low health. Titans don't need to give a shit about damage. Supers are interesting as they aren't an issue, so have fun with the Supers. Another thing Bungie did wrong is heavy weapons. Ammo for heavy weapons should not be in one place on the map, each team should have their own supply. The way special ammo is done is fine. Heavy weapons should be a tool used by both teams to push through a center point rather than have BR over it and hope your team is lucky. The special abilities of Guardians aren't too important but the Warlock, obviously, has the most useless one known to man. Suffice it to say, one Guardian has gotten the stick more than the others. All these complaints come down to the final verdict that I started with. The Crucible is unredeemable garbage and those who say it's the best it's ever been and tell you to shut up are wrong. In fact maybe they should shut up.
---
Anthem is more like Warframe
---
Depends on the desert, the Artic counts as a desert, some space desert may be green
---
I've done it so many times with so many varying skills of jumping and ad clearing players. 
---
Me and my 6 year old son 2 manned it a few times to blast out his catalyst when we didnt have a 3rd clan mate online. 
---
Curious as to why you think its bullshit. I personally think it was one of the single greatest bonus things to do and teach people in the entirety of the game. 
---
More like: When we are doing C A P and half of our group has their games on a diffrent language and they have diffrent shortcuts because of that....
---
WARCOCK
---
All good my guy and I’m Xbox 1 
---
I never played it. But I trust you 
---
おまえはもう死んでいる
---
Exactly this. I don't understand how a strictly PvE game could "kill" and dual mode game. Not to mention it was never supposed to be a destiny killer. They cater to different markets. It's like saying Tony hawks pro skater is a Forza killer. Sports games of completely different leagues. 
---
No need for a destiny killer when bungie does that by itself.
---
Yeah, I was worried too. Just watched a YouTube video about it and knocked it right out. Man, I love that gun. And, surprisingly, I don't see every single person using it in Crucible like everyone says. Out of 12 people I think I see 3 of them, including mine.
---
There is no difference in sentence length or ease of pronunciation between "light" and "power" if you remove the word "level," but whatever.
---
It's a pet peeve. Everyone has them. You can't really explain why it's so annoying to you. 
---
You on PS4?
---
Man I'm just trying to imagine waking up and actually thinking like this and I just don't understand how someone is as clueless as you.
---
Congrats 
---
Why is it always the opposite for me I pop super and proceed to get stomped no matter what 
---
Fml. This!
---
Whats your tag
---
What are ascendant challenges?
---
Once a week a portal spawns in the dreaming city, and to see the portal you can use a consumable called a ‘tincture of queensfoil’. Basically you go through the portal and it is a different challenge each week and at the end you get a chest and complete your bounty that you can pick up from Petra 
---
Currently playing on a PS4 Pro and have no issues with load times. My friend on the other hand has the OG PS4 and his load times are garbage. 
---
Wow i have all of these
---
Seconding this

Far be it from me to critique your work when you didnt ask for it to begin with but it seems kinda busy where the warlock insignia and the dawnblade meet. Maybe its just me though. Good job, keep it up!

Should be an option to autodismantle blues

May I request in 1080p? Or for mobile?

How long did it take to acquire that via an arcade game?

P.S. I’d love that as a poster.

link to your channel or any gameplay vids?
---
Maybe or maybe the colors but yea its not perfect but I'll try to improve. Thanks man!
---
Enjoy playing crucible and lost sectors!
---
I know that youve got this! The only way is forward!
---
Same
---
Mobile coming up! 
---
They're not quite as long as the loading screens in destiny. The problem is that there's 20x more of them. This isn't really a problem on PC with SSD's but I can see why it would be horrendous to play on console.
---
That sucks. Thanks for the info.
---
Sucks to be bad at aiming. Try mouse and keyboard someday bud. Shit's a joke, passed it 1st try
---
Well that's, not bad I guess? Is the order 1,3,2 from left to to right? 
---
*Sweeeeeet*
---
Thrall gon getcha
---
All it is is outlaw so it probably won't.  But props man. 
---
Thanks. I'm more into the orbs it'll make cause of being the masterwork. Let's hope that helps somewhere down the line.

Back in D1 when everyone was getting green engrams no matter the light level

That\`s not one-time effort to keep online game alive. Forsaken implemented lots of stuff (which mostly should be done at release, but ok) and made Destiny playable. Was it good? Well... Yeah? It was. BUT. After sweet Forsaken they decided that that\`s enough and now they can again do literally nothing. 5 exotics per season. No vendor resets. 0 new strikes. Trials and Rallies are delayed for FEW SEASONS from now. Key molt bug is not fixed yet, but the next season drops in few weeks. Weapon frames bug was a thing for half a fcking season. Balance updates occur once per season and are presented like something special, while QOL updates, balance and bugfixes should be done as soon as possible. They said that there would be no new destination and story in BA, however they said that it will be "end-game focused". And all we got - 4 ball throwing arenas with same mechanics and shared lootpool with raid, 2 armor sets and... well. That\`s it. This was content for 3 month. At least we got raid.   
---
In JW will be no raid, no destination and story, Trials and Rallies wont return. From the confirmed content - new Gambit game mode and "reserve" year 1 catalysts. Year one. Catalysts. We knew what they are doing for almost a year now. I can\`t imagine putting even less effort in DLC than this. New game mode for gambit? Well, nice, cool, fun, but can we have balance and matchmaking fixed? Skill-based matchmaking is not a thing since Warmind (they took it to "adjust" just like trials), matchmaking vs full groups is everyday experience, balance issues are being addressed once per season or even once per two. Hello one-eyed mask. 
---
*I will never hit the light cap cus I don't have Foresaken...*
---
Same. I forgot they were even green...
---
Props to Bungie for actual useful colorblind options, by the way. I wish it worked for the red arrow that shows you the direction you're being hit from, but that's the only complaint I have about it, which is *way* more than I can say about colorblind options in other games.
---
Phone wallpaper link: [https://imgur.com/gallery/3rwMMdI](https://imgur.com/gallery/3rwMMdI)
---
i dont quite get the title tho.
---
Yeah I think it may be a bug or something.  Not trying to sound like a jerk or brag or whatever but I thought it was a fun western-style duel and got it on the first attempt.  Aim at the weapon, and wait for them to draw before you shoot.  It was really simple, so the only explanation I have is lag or bugs.
---
Im guessing you were using a mouse. 
---
I play on PC and the difference is that counterbalance adds more stability meaning your won't have to readjust your aim down so much while Targeting adjuster adds more range and target acquisition. Meanwhile range affects aim assist on controller. 
---
Glad to know i wasnt the only one 
---
In that video he wasn't using heavy pretty much at all.  He was using fighting lion and a sniper.  Limited ammo for both, no true primary, I couldn't do it.  The difficulty was higher for Cammy in that fight tbh, yet he still pulls it off.
---
i dont understand why not put the sparrow first and the sword second 
---
if you don't mind dying to shotgunners, put skullfort on and go arc titan in rumble. fun as hell but probably won't win you any matches

Could care less about titles, got this shell first ascendant challenge.

The guy in destiny has only one thing cause he dismantled everything else
---
It took me mouths
---
I've come against CammyCakes 4 times now in quickplay. Each match has been close, he's really good and quick on his feet and adaptable. I've been able to go back and forth with him in some team engagements but I won't like and say it's easy. I've never been pub stomped by him though thankfully but he's good enough that you can't even really get mad if it were to happen.
---
I used 50 tries. I use incredibly low sensitivity so i barely had time to aim 
---
Man, I haven't seen a green engram in forever
---
4 hours playing comp, -500 glory earned, drop from Fabled to Heroic :(
---
I don't understand it either.
---
I guess some ppl can just use the same load out day in day out and not get bored or burnt out.
---
*Some Anthem players
---
Its long for people with shiternet and low spec PC's
---
As soon as get off work I hope on and burn through a few contracts.
---
Do u happen to use DRB and wardcliff coil by any chance? 
---
Its rage inducing, either shitty roll or low light.
---
Yea it was 
---
Not quite the same, but Riskrunner with the catalyst is pretty close.
---
Praise Geraldo
---
Oh man, I got them from xurs exotic engram this week. Sorry.
---
I just popped a rally barricade and spammed shots on that last spawn. Makes it much easier
---
nah im a Bite of the fox / hammerhead kinda guy although i have brought the DRB out a few times in comp
---
dont you change specs at the forge? thats exactly where the launchpoint is, iirc its also the only place you spawn after leaving a mission?   
---
Even with the new waypoint, ikora is still far away from it imo, id compare it more to tess or postmaster if anything, unless spawning in tarsis has changed since the demo.  
---
Still, pretty fucked up that you have to go back to tarsis to change ANYTHING
---
I swear I thought it was the other ghost? Cause I have this ghost already I've gotten it multiple times
---
So does that mean I just need the sparrow and ship then?
---
now the crutch is gone(kinda). YAYYY
---
Yes that was me the last time it was the NF lol
---
Visually better than destiny, hol up something ain’t right here 
---
[removed]
---
Why are trying it solo.you need a friend
---
I told myself this would be the season I get my Luna's, but I just don't feel the need that I used to. Was a level 20 for several months in comp and until Friday, I just got Forsaken.  Been having so much fun with Gambit and other Forsaken content, I didn't care for my Luna's Howl. I do know for a fact I can get it next season, since I can actually abuse the meta more than a regular F2P character can now. If I can get to 1800 last season, and 1994 this season as a level 20 solo queuing, I can definitely do it now.
---
Somebody edit this to make only one eye shine
---
I throw a smoke and dodge while it’s flying, smoke pings enemy radar and Invis + Dragon’s Shadow = primed to flank
---
This is unfortunately very accurate 
---
We don’t really know yet. On one hand bungie is free from external influence on their games so they can finally make the game the want. On the other hand bungie has less money to work with which could very easily negatively impact D3. 
---
Only time will tell if the reason d1/2 have been so rocky is due to activisions meddling or Bungie’s incompetance. 
---
Yeah I know that, but I'll just wait for next season tbh.
---
CTRL+ALT+DEL comic, by the way, for anyone interested.

It was great, fun, and entertaining for many years before the auhtor decided to make a "reboot."

I have this same question... I just purchased the legendary edition also and enjoying it so far, but worried of the upcoming content and if I’ll be locked out at that point.

That wolf hunter cloak at the bottom would be fope in d2

me too bro almost 50 runs to claim but its in my collections now and thats all that matters lol

When it gets here, but until then bl2 #1

The Edz is just Europe so a lot of people don’t need cars

What the fuck

Head back to spider at some point he'll have a quest to start unlocking the black armory forges if you have the annual pass. 
---
There are a fair few exotic weapons you can get from long quests too, check this out https://twinfinite.net/2017/09/destiny-2-get-complete-all-exotic-quests/
---
Nope, 2014 Advanced Warfare edition
---
Destiny 2 is great how is it bad now??? 
---
The point is: Instead of blaming the players in your team for doing less than you while bragging about your stats, you should rethink what you could have done better since thats the only thing you can control. Also noone likes bragging, especialy when it‘s about nothing.
---
Cheers everyone! Just gonna leave it for another day, got to that agonising stage... got 3 prime engrams out of it though - plus side 😂
---
Read the earlier comments I already acknowledged the guy right under me but everyone else was doing shit 
---
Anther is a Destiny Dier
---
I don't have the annual pass, so I don't even know how I got the quest at the first place. I went to the forge and it just asks me to buy the pass. I ain't gonna buy a fucking pass after paying full price and this spider planet dlc thing that I forgot the name of. It's too expensive anyways for my poor ass who already bought the game itself lol.
---
I'm glad it's getting nerfed. I main Titan and I refuse to use it just because playing against it pisses me off so much
---
I joined a group at the Riven encounter and wasn’t expecting anything. They all opened their chests and got nothing so I opened mine. I was so freaking excited when I saw 1k voices drop on what was my 5th-ish completion. Then I felt bad for all of the other people in my raid group who didn’t get it. I wish they made it easier for people to get it. That being said I’m on my 32nd escalation protocol clear with no shotgun. Maybe karma
---
So the base campaign exotics let you pick one, then put the rest into the loot pool. If you character boost, you just kinda miss out on them. Same goes for Zavala's exotic engram and Asher's exotic weapons. With the COO and Warmind exotics however, they get put into your collections and you can just reclaim them whenever you'd like. 
---
Did this work for you?
---
&gt; Been having so much fun with Gambit

How?? You must play with a team. Gambit is boring as fuck, no one knows how to play. 
---
If you have decent enough hip fire aim, do NOT use a controller because that makes it harder to quickly move your gun to shoot the other guys. The aim assist on controller might be nice,  it it’s not worth it IMO.
---
Haha absolutely. Same here.
---
Yeah was thinking that there. Getting frustrated over the gun when I don’t even think I’d use it much! But yeah the controller is a struggle 
---
This happened to me to, but with Asher and Sloane. You want the character you are leveling up to be level 20 or higher before claiming the Exotic weapon. (That's the level gap in the Destiny base campaign. Must be level 20 to use Exotics) 
---
If the story missions are red, with wierd trapezoid like shapes on it, it is the base campaign. If it is yellow and has an eye in it, that is Curse of Osiris. If it is light blue, that is Warmind. Finally, if it is like an off shade of yellow with a symbol that looks like an eight year old tried making a Chinese character, that is Forsaken. All 4 campaigns go in that respective order. 
---
Hope this helps!
---
&gt; Exactly! My clan ran a six stack this afternoon for a couple of hours and it was a blast.
---
Destroying teams of randos is probably fun yeah. For you. 
---
&gt;&gt; It’s not the same as the demo after the first few missions, it changes to in front of the launch pad which the forge is right next to you when you spawn
---
Ah fair enough. In all honesty I didn’t say Ikora cause she was far away, I said Ikora cause she seemed to me the most likely NPC they would tie that function to if they did it.
---
D1 definitely had better sets 
---
Yes you do 
---
 Because I’m sure the hp of the boss is reset to 0at the end 
---
Destiny bad
---
Armor is very useful, bungie fixed the game from year 1, rng for seals is dumb I agree, gambit is not the best thing to come, Destiny got revived by forsaken and it fixed the game, same way taken king did in d1 
---
For sure. Leave slugs alone. They're supposed to have good range and damage.
---
That’s how it was for me. I streamed the game for four hours and when I went through the VOD I had 1:50 gameplay and 2:10 loading screen time. It was awful. I like the game but I’m honestly glad for the 10 hour trial with EA access because I would have been pretty annoyed paying full price for the game in its current state 
---
I'm surprised people still knee jerk react this way. I've gotten used to just not talking about games or things I like  around those folks though.. I eventually found that they just jump on hate bandwagons to stay relevant or empowered somehow. This isn't everyone but I haven't found my life lacking with those people absent.
---
According to the video in the Twitter post, it's any public event in that area.
---
The emblem counts the number of times you beat the forge. It does not count whether or not you actually forged a weapon. You can do forges without a weapon frame, or without being on the step of the weapon frame where it asks you to do a forge. 
---
Huh. I have a 2015 Halo MCC bundle Xbox One S and the graphics are crappy lol
---
I so badly wish I could disable aim assist--at least on the centering part (free heatseeking bullets are still nice).
---
Fuck
---
Kind of now that I look at it... oh well xD
---
The only quests whose progress resets are the ones that say things like "reach this rank within one season," because infamy, glory, and valor ranks are set to 0 at the start of a season. Since the Last Word quest steps are not like that, you should not lose progress. 
---
For some reason, everyone thinks annual pass stuff is limited time. **IT IS NOT!** Season changes just mean that no new forge stuff will be added after this. It will all still be available. 
---
Forsaken is definitely worth it. If you don't play enough to exhaust the activities added with Forsaken, you don't need the annual pass. 
---
I would throw in, there are some that double dip into both games. I have fun in different ways in both.  
---
Destiny still makes me feel like Master chief in my xbox days. Anthem makes me feel like I'm playing Division with a lot more mobility (which I like).
---
Well I was more so saying that if you were to disable aim assist for one day and then turn it back on your natural aim would be considerably better. 
---
Or plug a mouse with high dpi and keyboard in lol.
---
The "Never Say Die" medal gives it away
---
If you don't have the annual pass, you cannot do the [activities listed here](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47465) under "annual pass" on the chart. 
---
You will be able to buy the annual pass later if you decide you want it, and all those activities will still be available. The only limited time activities are holiday events such as the recent Crimson Days for Valentine's Day. 
---
Aim assist on consoles is crazy! Never noticed it so much before. Cool sidearm though.
---
If we had SBMM this wouldn't be a problem. And I probably wouldn't hate quickplay.
---
I was getting rolled so hard the first week this weapon came out; I normally casual QP with a 1.5 KDA, but it was in the .4 area because every team was a sweat-fest.
---
Took some time off QP for a while, then came back and finished it in about 2 hours. Do you have Jotuun? That carried my terribad ass for most of it. I just followed slide-ape teammates around with stacked fusion rifle scavenger perks and sniped people at mid range.
---
For everyone who thinks this is fake: No it isn't! It's just a nice catch and when I dismantle a blue weapon I also got the loot for a mission in the dreaming city. :D
---
oooh someone updated the comic
---
Go crawl into a hole and never return. Yours must be a miserable existence. And please, learn to spell.
---
Back to back drops...I hate my RNG.  I grind and grind and can't get either to drop. 
---
Congrats man, huge accomplishment.  
---
i was using a controller and it only took me 7 attempts, so 50 is still way too much
---
There's a secret achievement/emblem for all four players depositing 15 motes at the same time.
---
did you search for destiny on pornhub?
---
dont carry 15 then
---
Random drops, but each has a higher probablility to drop from certain things.  Ghost from the ascendant, ship from shattered throne, and sparrow from weekly missions.  
---
i had to do this when i was doing it for the first (and only) time just so the people who knew what they were doing could beat the encounter
---
Bungo can we please make this a thing that would be the ultimate easter egg
---
I think everyone covered it pretty well here, in terms of usage.  So, can't really add much more to that.  But, this is my go to setup for when I play Gambit with my clan.  It also helps clear out large groups of enemies when others are using their supers / strong weapons against those that you have tethered against.  Because you get so much super energy back by using in groups of enemies, you can usually have it ready to roll as soon as the prime spawns, which is helpful when others are trying to knock out the Envoys at the start.
---
One thing I don't know (and maybe you all can help clarify this for me), is that do they stack at all?  Sometimes when I pop the tether at the start of a prime spawn, I get enough back to shoot a 2nd shot right away, but usually hold off till the first round is gone and save it, as I'm not sure if shooting a 2nd one right away is a waste.
---
It's the only way I communicate with other players, love it.
---
The Duke hits hard if you can be consistently accurate. And that gunshot sound makes it feel strong.
---
Don't forget the DRB and the luna
---
my life is wonderful! 
---
I also get to have fun putting idiots like you in their places
---
 you can keep telling yourself what you need to compensate for the piss one that you live though.. now id appreciate it if you got off my dick you've already been scolded like a spoil child now sit there like a good little bitch and let the grown up run his errands!
---
It feels as powerful as it is, from the kick to the sound. I love it.
---
I'll get off your dick the day you stop being a prick. Which I suspect would be never. Prance off to your pony land.
---
fuck all you pussy niggers downvoting
---
Hi, DarkFlameZealot!

I am stopping by to offer you a robot hug! Have an excellent day!

"Come on baby, what's the name?!"
---
Yeah it looks like the health bar is actually the same on all enemies but the amount of armor differs I was watching a lot of reviews from the beta because I didn’t have internet or the ability to play when it launched. But looks like if you just shoot it in the chest consistently yes they are bullet sponges as is the case in a lot of looter shooters that I’ve played but if you’re remotely tactical like it’s meant to be played it’s not as bad.
---
Also sorry, i deserve a cross-post to r/killthecameraman.
---
Because people that suck at playing it are salty
---
Still lost despite my efforts to get keep the win streak alive 
---
PLEASE, the amount of times my Hunter or Titan friend has pushed me mid flight and soaring off the fucking map is insane
---
Right now you can titan slate on PC so fast that you can get to the c capture zone in control before the entire other team makes it there, and they spawn next to it. I've done it a few times. But got utterly destroyed in the 4 v 1 lol but it's still funny to get that first kill because they don't expect it.
---
It must be if we've gone this long without it. They know we don't like it, hopefully they're working on it now.
---
That would make sense. The icon says forsaken - any way to know if I have it or not? 
---
Interesting, when I first heard of it, I only ever considered the PvE implications. That being possible in PvP is shit. How the hell did they not nerf that until now? Eep.
---
Didn’t see it! 😅 My bad.
---
It is a legitimate complaint when they are sandwiched between sections of what is supposed to be a seamless open world.
---
Checked account, just a salty ass with nothing of value to contribute to any conversation
---
A lot  worse than they did in d1
---
a sniper 
---
Complete the bounty and it wont expire
---
Which one? 
---
It was the business for a long time. Definitely worth trying. 
---
that's what they say, but it still works for me.
---
Man i gave up at 1300 glory with a 1.92 k/d, more than half the times top of the board. Comp is not for everyone, you can be really good with 3 stones as teammates or the average pvper either way the only thing you need is a fucking boat of patience and strong will (i had to give up cause pvp-induced anger and anxiety caused me a heart disease at 26(!)). Dont be ashamed if you give up, you just decided you deserve to keep your sanity and health. 
---
Yep tried all of it,tried xur exotic didn't work, chance of exotic dropping in world is impossible, better chance of winning the lottery 
---
# YOU’VE YEED YOUR LAST HAW BROTHER
---
It's about right
---
Well first you gotta shake that trashcan thought off. You are a guardian, start thinking like one. Mid to long range fights for a start. Find a pulse or a scout [or both] that you like and just focus on staying alive. Sounds dumb but the survival instincts will turn into skills that then can be applied to pushing for kills instead of just surviving. 
---
I think I just died inside after grinding for days to get a good role.
---
Don't underestimate the ability to keep doing something even though you hate it! Trust me, ive been playing overwatch for quite a while now...
---
ok
---
Really? I don’t know if you guys have been keeping up, but every now and then someone makes a post about problems in the game, and they’re not downvoted for that, this includes stating how the current PvP is atrocious due to meta, balances, etc., how there hasn’t been an update for Y1 gear, or how some weekly things just seem useless after a while. Usually these posts make it to front page. I do believe some people are too naive about the game not being bad, but not everyone. 
---
It’s not a big nerf. The mark time down from 15 seconds to 8. The health and shield regent will still be a thing but not right after a kill. Probably the time it takes to get a healing rift down is what I’m guessing but it will give you the overshield at the same time. Didn’t say anything about the damage boost so I’m guessing that staying. Coming from a salty Titan that has this one exotic left to get. 
---
Wow! Thanks a lot for this information. I now have a better view of how this works and it all makes a lot of sense to me now. 
---
100% recommend get to anthem I'm having a blast
---
And the answer is?
---
I mean, most of the dudes I played Destiny with thinks it’s really bad (between 50-100ppl). We were all really good. There are plenty of reason why someone thinks a game is bad, I think one of the reasons why we didn’t like it is BECAUSE we were good at it; it doesn’t feel like it’s challenging.
---
I played through the entirety of D1. I played D2 for a little over a year and honestly I never really liked either. The steady opinion I had throughout my experience with Destiny is that it’s a game created for the casual gamer; there’s nothing inherently bad with that but for me personally that really does make it bad. Many mechanics that take skill away, poor matchmaking systems and no real rank until halfway through D2. PvP was too easy and repetitive, though I’ve never liked PvE so my opinion on the PvE side of things is irrelevant. Basically everyone (out of those 50-100ppl) feel exactly the same as I do about Destiny. In short; it’s a casual, easy and repetitive game. 
---
Talking about whether a game is good or bad doesn’t really work on a forum specifically about that game: most people are here because they like the game. 
---
gunsmith's devotion ones
---
Nah. I mean kinda. They mostly hate it cause the money. That’s always been their main thing. The dlcs. 
---
Sounds like your on PC 
---
honestly haven't had this much fun in destiny since i first started playing d1, when i wake up all i want to do is play destiny
---
yep, the best way to play.
---
Practice and you’ll eventually learn the maps and your aim will improve over time 
---
Weapons don't get better? Ok, bud. There are a number of weapons that are quest-exclusive, and aren't available until you get further in the game, or at least are harder to obtain like: Sleeper Simulant, Polaris Lance, Legend of Acrius,  Whisper, etc...  And all these weapons hit harder than what you were using before you got em. Heck, even jotunn and le Monarque
---
Dont underestimate The ea sports community 
---
The hardest decisions require the strongest wills
---
Cheers for the links 
---
How did you get so much of your super back from those thralls? I can hardly ever get any from Skull of Dire Ahamkara. 
---
It takes primary ammo drops. That's what that reflects.
---
Depending on the run in Anthem I can say I have seen about 5-9 items at the end of the run
---
Then the categories should be Primary, Special, and Heavy. Also, Fighting Lions is in the Energy Section if I'm not mistaken and that uses primary ammo as well
---
It happened to me recently with a kid in one of my classes. He probably hasn't graduated from Fortnite yet
---
Well we don't have to worry about Titan Skating either
---
but the fact that no one mentions him anymore
---
It is kinda stale and relies on dlc, but as much as fans say its bad they cant stop because its also good
---
Titans
---
Same i couldn't understand how people had problems with this it was an easy first try for me
---
As a titan main, I disagree with your entire statement. Hunter's are loads of fun though. Dodge to reload/charge melee? Yes, please. I can't count how many times i've caught a noob warlock dropping a rift with a throwing hammer/knife, and it never loses that satisfying tingle. Although, the sound of warps sends me into fight or flight every damn time.
---
Im a warlock main and hunters are better in every aspect. The dev team has no idea what balance is
---
Now, I could explain why I prefer hunters and why they are clearly superior in pvp with strong supers and high mobility and also good in pve with tether or celestial nighthawk but to be honest, I can't remember a warlock dying in D2...
---
Punches screebs killing your teammate as well as yourself. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED 
---
Never used a Titan so I have no idea what that is. Is it that thing titans do by jumping around so they move fast?
---
no. Do u remember res sniping in D1?
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 13.
---
/r/Fireteams 
---
I actually call it nothing but Black Hammer
---
I dont think it would be too hard to add an extra binding on PC. It could be
---
Melee - Bind to V
---
Melee Ability - Bind to B
---
etc. 
---
I understand this wouldnt work for console but maybe they could hold it in for an extra half second like charged grenades.
---
I’m worse than you... lol my trick to get better was
---
Stay with the fire team, use targeting adjusters and/or helmets, and pace yourself. 
---
Getting Caydes gun was ultimately what showed me to do this but now I run the maps with different weapons then hand cannons and while I’m not incredibly better my K/D ratio is much better now. 
---
that’s why u gotta proofread your memes brotha 
---
I would use that particular Go Figure over the vendor roll Bygones.
---
On the flip side, I have an Outlaw/Rampage Bygones that I much prefer over Go Figure. It's what I used for the entirety of my Redrix quest last season. 
---
The gunplay is 100% like mass effect even if the ability system is completely different. 
---
\*laughs in nova bomb\*
---
ehm this is world record on ps4? have seen and done better on PC!
---
What drop did you get
---
*seeing the image... read the comment... read the name... upvote that comment*
---
Yes. I have 5 mouse buttons for a reason. C for ability, mouse 5 for lunge
---
i have so many skins i dont wanna miss out :,(
---
What is though
---
This is a wholesome meme. Protect the kinderguardians! They are too pure and innocent for this world.
---
this was also the first which came to my mind xD
---
Nothing 
---
Still miss my Steady Hand from Iron Banner tbh. Wish a lot of old weapons would get an update
---
Or being at 263 light level (or whatever it's called) for 3 weeks before getting a piece of great that bumps you up to 264, then waiting even longer before getting 265
---
That's why I stopped playing, at least. Also, wasted a ton of time on a Titan before realizing that their ultimates are trash compared to the other classes.
---
It’s in the lost sector Aphelion's Rest this week 
---
you needed 50 attempts to shoot 3 things in "ORDER"?
---
You're*
---
You are having a conversation with Bungie. They're telling you to party like it's 1999, respond by flipping the bird and getting that last point!
---
I have this exact roll on my go figure aswell,its pretty good!
---
Yes
---
It is 
---
I’ve always been Voidlock. That’s been my go to forever. #bringbackTlaloc

Hello. I understand we are speaking about nerds. Therefore, we are lowering all Fusion Rifle stats by 60 percent, and implementing what we call "Invisible Double Juggler," which takes away ammo randomly when you pick up an ammo brick.
---
Good motehound
---
The reaction would be r/perfectlycutscreams
---
Exactly my same thoughts. The way the phrased it makes me think it will not have the huge impact we were hoping for, titans are still gonna be too fast.
---
The annual pass is a one time purchase. It is called "annual" because it is a bundle of the 3 smaller DLCs being released over the course of a whole year, not because you have to buy it each year or anything. 
---
You probably didn't Hand your talisman to the Statue with the bow right after the ogre fight.
---
It happened to me aswell, i was like wtf am i doing here? 
---
Xbone! 
---
Yeah, I've done that one and I just... I can't ever kill enough enemies to get a decent recharge. It's depressing.
---
Hello yes you know how you can sometimes just miss even if you aim directly at an enemy due to lag or something of the sort? Well we have decided to implement that into every gun, and are giving sniper rifles an even higher chance of missing! Also we have buffed netcode by making people with pings above 100 invincible
---
No clue if I’m right but it might be the old guided games token package that people got when the game first came out
---
Bedazzled milling is a AAA hallmark.
---
You need to win for that to matter
---
Warframe grind has always sucked.
---
Destiny shits all over Warframe for single player
---
I’m doing so much back tracking right now it’s crazy hahah I just causally played year 1 and now I’m actually grinding shit and keep finding ransoms stuff like this lol
