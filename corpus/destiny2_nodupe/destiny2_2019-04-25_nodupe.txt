Quite impressive

---
If you have discord, there is a destiny 2 channel that includes everything from destiny fashion to lfg to clan recruitment. Includes all platforms as well. You could try looking there.
---
But it makes enemies panic more when shooting you,making them more prone to missing and giving him a better chance,OEM isn't a straight boost,it's a psycological weapon
---
Didnt know there was a cap on it. Even if you cant its not like it changes much you can just make the same character again.

There's an infographic that you can look at here -&gt; https://destinynewshub.com/guide/destiny-2-annual-pass-in-depth-roadmap-analysis/
---

---
The Forsaken Annual Pass unlocks a bunch of stuff before those who have the "free" version of the game. It's worth it if there's only a $5 EUR difference, because you get access to things like the Thorn Quest, the Invitations of the Nine which is the lore books for Xur and the Nine, and get access to things like some weapon and armor that the "free" version does not. The roadmap in the article I linked shows a breakdown of what you get and what you don't.
---
You have to be on the same profile as the old character. Your characters should show up on the start screen as max level only as the game loads for the first time on that profile. The only difference is that some voice lines change. For example ghost didn't know who Rasputin was or what a warmind was and there was some dialogue explaining it.
---
I mean dreaming city‚Äôs revery dawn armor does make titans look like knights kinda.
---
Whats the question?
---
Caught in a landslide
---
The reason for the cap was the limited time achievements (Moments of Triumph) associated with your account being transferred over, and Veteran status which altered some of the dialogue in D2. And the ‚Äòmemory highlights‚Äô icon at character select. Otherwise, there is no real reason to transfer over, as nothing of real value would transfer over besides appearance.
---
Memes aren't supposed to be funny, or now is just about complaining?
---
Any idea when this season ends ?
---
this is hot
---
June I think
---
I like that idea. Like a hard light or borealis.
---
Also if you're on PS4 and looking for a clan we are trying to get more members.
---
Oh right I got a whole month ü§ôü§ô
---
What is key framing?
---
Idk man I'm having fun in IB with kepri horn and jemini pants. It's been a great chance to pull out niche exotics and give them a go. It's shaken things up, and you've got to adapt. It's not permanent. I'm on PS4 tho, idk if pc is worse off than us.
---
/r/theydidthemath
---
i didn't really know, given how i only played destiny 2 on pc (don't have a ps4) but i tought it was pretty neat detail
---
Dinklebot is the one true bot!
---
Do u know when she comes back to get my 3rd seed of light
---
What I wish they would add is slowly releasing the trigger to undraw your bow. They had a feature like that in Halo 3 for the plasma pistol.
---
Omg I posted twice ima dumbass
---
yes I did.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
^(its probably not that accurate)
---
I run 5/7/3 with dragons shadow
---
My Titan and Warlock are both 3/6/9 with a mix of Redrix/Dust Rock, Erentil/Luna's and a Hammerhead.
---
Hunter is 6/5/5 with Dust Rock, Luna's, and a Wardcliff.
---
Don‚Äôt be a dumpling
---
You must kill the knights before the shrieker
---
*savathuns song
---
Chances are that NF was purchased, anyone that toxic will find it hard to get into a good team willing to deal with their shit all the way to 5500
---
that would be nice, but i think just pressing the reload key does the same thing
---
If you're coming from other shooters the destiny community is great in comparison.
---
If you are coming from other games its toxic as hell
---
Please enlighten me with the reason(s) you think Uldren can't be the new Hunter Vanguard. Besides the obvious, hes a brand new guardian and hated by the other vanguard members.
---
Not at all difficult, UNLESSSSSSS you don‚Äôt have any other characters then congrats
---
As a fellow warlock I like this
---
well i killed him, now i don‚Äòt have my super anymore
---
worth it i guess?
---
*shudders and remembers d1 warlock glide
---
Just as a heads up, I think the difference in power caps out at around 50 so being 50 above the recommended and being 100 over will have the same effect. Also when soloing a nightfall take advantage of the five of swords item from xur which let‚Äôs to customize the modifiers and elemental singe affecting the nightfall. And last, some nightfalls are much easier to solo than others. You just got to know what you can handle.
---
Oh gosh, I bet that guy was pissed off!
---
Plot twist: a grenade falls out and wipes your team while you're invading.
---
*slowly falls to death in warlock glide*
---
Half of my team isn‚Äôt capturing points. They‚Äôre just ‚Äúgoing for kills‚Äù aka dying repeatedly
---
Nice! You can do it man. 74k myself
---
Repost with a proper title.
---
"Update" is waaaay to vague.
---
It‚Äôs destiny , it‚Äôs already vague
---
Do it!
---
I'm partial to Voidwalker.
---
Just for friendly edification, the name is spelled "Tyrion Lannister." :) It doesn't matter, of course, but just so you know, in case you don't!
---
I mean you can dislike crucible but gambit pvp?! just grab some scout riffle or sniper and snipe the enemy team when invading or snipe the invader. it‚Äòs easy, you get at least 1-2 kills every time, you don‚Äòt get killed by supers or heavy guns. just help me to understand because I‚Äòm a pvp ape and  wiping the enemy team is something that happens once on a while for me. usually running breakneck, trust and wisper of the worm
---
Man, I tried it with a Titan trying to do the infinite shields but I kept running out of time, I think I‚Äôll switch to warlock and try your strategy instead
---
I jumped in yesterday and had tons of fun. personal preference I guess
---
Ah sorry quickplay? I don‚Äôt have annual pass so there‚Äôs only one I can play
---
Oh this is awesome thank you!
---
Eventually this became the children‚Äôs TV show ‚ÄúSteven Universe‚Äù
---
Hawk moon and rose right?
---
Warlock main who just got into Titan. Can't argue against this logic
---
For everyone saying that's Luna's - that's Not Forgotten
---
Spoken like a true Guardian. Keep up the fair fight.
---
Lol that would be brutal in PvP.
---
Don't you see the image? He earned it :)
---
20 even
---
That's just a bow...and you're shooting dregs.
---
It is the good loot.  It's the Ace of Plaids.
---
I'll never understand game dev's obsession with knockbacks, knockdowns, obnoxious stuns and other CC. 
---
It *really* isn't fun.
---
Dude, if you are using your weapons right now you are doing it wrong. With the revelry tonic you basically have infinite grenades (and you can even boost the grenades damage with an elemental singe and the grenadier modifier), same thing basically goes for melee, but grenades are the ‚Äúsafest‚Äù option.
---
Why waste your time plinking away at yellow/orange bars while you can toss a mini nuke grenade at them every second or 2 depending on how much revelry gear you have and what exotic you combine with your load out.
---
technically no, if it followed real gun logic pulling the hammer back would require a lot less pull on the trigger, making it faster to fire kind of
---
Does this actually work? Like, is it confirmed? I am going to give it a shot.
---
Nope, just an awful copypasta I reworked into some awful but tasteless crap that was a hit on a Destiny Shitposting group on FB.
---
The Helmet stayed on.
---
oh no
---
I wish they make it all the pvp modes and keep iron banner around 24/7. They can even leave the powerful engrams out or make it once a month.
---
Yes, but what we need is a conga line..
---
Alright, alright, alright. We have to work together to save Earthrealm from Kronika and her army of bad guys.
---
Or Ana Bray. I would LUUUUUV for Ana Bray to be the next vanguard hunter.
---
Thanks for actually doing your job blueberries
---
Depending on the class, you can make builds that are on the same level as the grenade spam in terms of how broken they are.
---
But keep in mind what you're playing. **Competitive is not a place to be fair to your opponent's it's a place to abuse anything and everything that gives you an edge over others.** 
---
If someone plays well on your or the enemy team add them, that's how I got 3 wonderful teammates who not just improved my positioning alot but also meant that I don't have to deal with randoms when they're online.
---
*Unless you pay for boosting then you truly are a c\*\*\* but in that case you'd already be using your LH.*
---
So true
---
You had half hp so what killed you? Glitch?
---
Hahaa yea, probably you're right but i really don't like to use what everybody, here is why i complainüò•
---
it is already a team wiper if done right. also invisibility by dodge is really good. I like the middle tree arc better tho. fuck spectral blades
---
Whenever I'm salty because people are standing around not helping I'm just gonna message then to "Read Darci Lore"
---
I can't agree with you because I despise Clash. Control is fun especially with the hunt
---
It's a pretty easy grind so go for it. It's not amazing but it's good. Plus you never know when bungie is going to buff something then you'll wish you had it and not be able to get it.
---
My PC died last week -  I feel like I'm not missing out but rather "picked" the best time to take a break from the game.
---
I have one - it‚Äôs comical for the numbers but a total pain in the dick to use reliably
---
Laughs in feedback fence, you‚Äôll die from your own punch.
---
i flew straight into the wall after i got yeeted by the phalanx
---
Also glimmer and materials thingy and medallion should count only when in game and not in orbit.
---
I don't want to use my medallions when I'm not sure if I'll be playing for 4 hours...
---
yes
---
Cross Counter hits for 300 base - 460 with 3x Combination Blow.
---
I remember having to watch a clip replay to see what happened when I one-punched an invader through his improved overshield.
---
yes master
---
It's a good but rather niche weapon.
---
It works great in Gambit, especially Gambit-Prime during the Envoy Phase, and in PvE encounters involving many shielded enemies.
---
In PvP it is acceptable provided you are comfortable with the short delay Linears have do to their charge time and if you can trigger any short of damage buff it's capable of one shots on anyone below 10 res.
---
I literally quit D2 until they stop putting more fucking hand cannons in. I'm actually fucking tired of it. That and machine guns that can snipe. Machine guns absolutely ruined Gambit for me
---
Addendum.
---
Yes, I did get this during Revelry.
---
No, I don‚Äôt want to got though that again. That was arguably worse than Broadsword.
---
Congrats
---
Which one is that sorry?
---
If i could grind for specific emotes i would do it gladly (and not just earn bright dust in the hope of getting an emote) . I love when this happens!
---
Can you use the app or anything else and not bother people here?
---
Could maybe make her the new Hunter Vanguard, have it tied to allegiance quest. Maybe those that choose the Vanguard get the Rose, and maybe have people who sided with the drifter get a catalyst for Thorn or something.
---
Nobody is bothering you dude, youre the one on reddit
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 13.
---
/r/Fireteams
---
I have always liked it but that‚Äôs just my personal preference and since I master worked it I think it has about 13 thousand kills on it
---
Congratulations. Now prepare for all the messages saying you‚Äôre trash for using it üòâ
---
Facts my guy
---
A catalyst for Thorn would be insane. 
---
I like that line of thinking though!
---
Malfeasance, ofc.
---
Well I was 9 when I started destiny
---
Oof
---
Damn, congrats to who ever got it!
---
It‚Äôs called the bray tech winterwolf
---
Thanks!
---
I‚Äôll show myself to the garbage bin where I belong.
---
That's already proven not to work.
---
In D1, when we had our first Iron Banner Supremacy, people flipped out and the salt was real.
---
It'd be the same thing all over again.
---
*gold garbage bin. 
---
Seriously though, props to you for getting in during the season of skip grenades
---
This makes no sense but alright. All i'm saying is, that this is a not a subreddit to LFG. there is r/Fireteams, there is the Bungie App, there might actually be a Discord for PS4. This is not one of the places to LFG.
---
well, I' still at 30/100 precision HC kill, congrats.
---
I know - I never liked Division bc of 3rd person and Anthem lacks PvP, which I often enjoy.
---
I used a pulse rifle kinetic (Go Figure) and a Exotic Void Bow (Le Monarque) and also had a Void MachineGun (Hammerhead) for the Power slot, for class I was Dawnblade with Well of Radiance, I was also rocking fusion grenades as well as the Exotic chest piece that lets you rock a second fusion.
---
When jumping into the room on the right hand side is a pillar. There is a safe spot behind that pillar that you can make use of to clear the adds on the wizards to your left and right. Weaken the wizards as well while your at it and dont kill them. Once both wizards are weak kill the wizard to your left and use the space creatted by his death to move around to his spot and quickly kill the adds and wizard to the left again. Pick up the orb the first wizard dropped after killing an add or two. This is where I grab my Hammerhead for the rest of the way round the room. Kill the rest of the adds on the second wizard and the wizard as well, run over grab the orb, rinse repeat for wizards 3 and 4.
---
Once wizard 4 is killed run down to below one of the glowy wells. Wait till Vorgeth finishs his beam attack and jump up, get to the well and cast your  super, whilst casting your super deposit the light in the well. Just dps the boss at this point, if you have revelry grenade tonic going spam those suckers right down his throat, they hit like freight trains. Ignore the axiom bolts as Well of Radiance will tank them for you. Keep an eye on your well timer, once its low run back to your starting pillar. Rinse repeat. With the revelry tonic you should be able to do it in one or two cycles solo.
---
TAKE NO RISKS SOLO. If you think you can kill that add before Vorgeth or the Wizard can shoot you and your not at full hp, its not worth it. Play it safe.
---
Got this done last high curse week using this exact same strat without the revelry tonics. Oh and another thing, if your ready to do a second cycle and your well is not up, sit down and wait for that damn thing. It will make you life far easier.
---
Good luck out there Guardian.
---
Right? Like even if it added a little bit of range and an extra Devourer perk or something. Like if target dies from crit or poison tick give it an enhanced Devour, maybe have orbs move faster towards you and from longer distances and with a very small dot damage increase.
---
Appreciate it.
---
You‚Äôre on your way! Keep at it. If I can make it through Skip Grenade hell, so can you.
---
season of the drifter allegiance quest progression could be tweaked a little. my 2 alts are stuck on the clear the first tier 1 match of reckoning because no one plays tier 1 anymore. pinnacle weapons, especially the pvp ones are also a little too good for they are. legendaries should not be outclassing exotics yet after i got the recluse, that weapon is pretty much always in my energy slot now unless i need to run jotunn or lord of wolves for gambit. every other exotic is just collecting dust inside the vault now.
---
also world in devision is boring af
---
there's a way to use it if you listen to drifter when you get it, he tells you if multiple people have it, the slugs can stack, no matter who shoots
---
I generally think so too - theres lots of stuff to do. But I only played a few hours these past few weeks and basically only played comp, and only did milestones to warm up.  So it's more like that solo queueing in comp didn't do it for me anymore.
---
Thanks. I think I‚Äôll have to refer to Arcstriders as Arc-tillery Cannons from now on the way they throw those things.
---
I don't know why there's no one join...and I even join the Drifter side!
---
The Drifter works in mysterious ways.
---
Pretty sure this combo is twice as awful as skip 'nades.  
---
(So naturally I'm going to try it when I get home. XD)
---
This some imsorryjon stuff
---
i dont go for exotic quests usually but the arbalest one was really easy if u like the revelry event and the grind wasnt painful at all and as someone above told u, u never know when bungie is gonna buff something and plus u get to add it to the collection
---
Same over here. This is how i made the 200 kills i needed for the quest iron burden for the fusion :)
---
I reset ny rank in crucible thats how i got it
---
The biggest and only reason, Bungie would do it to troll us. Not because they can do whatever they want, but because they know it would piss us off.  They new killing Cayde would, what's stopping them from doing the same with Uldren?
---
Ferda!
---
-a hunter probably
---
People are downvoting you because they are scrubs. They are blaming the game for something, and choosing not to use the revelry tonics because of some made up principality. That's the definition of a scrub. 
---
Don't feel bad, it's the internet, it's full of babies. Babies gonna cry. 
---
Enjoy those grenades! I'll be out there skipping all week too!
---
I got that day 7 mobility 7 resilience and 6 recovery
---
That isn't the only way to get it though, right?
---
Yeah but that's definitely not enough, like bringing him back to life was the troll already.
---
Git gud
---
What platform and server
---
The weapon beside Ace is the last word. Crimson is not on this list because it's terrible. Like really truly bad.
---
"la volaita"
---
Why would Mara cut ties with her brother simply because hes a a lightbearer? And Uldren isnt just another awoken soldier. He survived the fight with Oryx and continued surviving beyond that. 
---
Also, our guardian is more powerful than any other guardian we currently know and has only been alive for a couple years, so age means next to nothing in terms of power. 
---
Zavala explained his denial of the reef invasion clearly. He didnt want any more guardian death, the Red war has been over nearly 2 years. We've been in recovery since before Curse of Osiris. But he still denied it, he is the commander and while he would consider Ikora's opinion, he still has ultimate decision. 
---
And other hunters not taking the job leaves limited options for a Hunter Vanguard. 
---
No one hates Uldten kore than I do. I have hated him since the first meeting with the Queen in D1 and even said to my buddies I hope it's me that gets to kill him. 
---
But him being resurrected opened some doors for his character. Maybe he doesn't become hunter vanguard. But I bet Bungie is setting it up.

Code of the Hamster
---
I found that prodigal robes with Skull of Ahamkara with the ornament looks pretty good.
---
So multiple runs of 100k wont increase my chances? What modifiers should I use for 200k?
---
Recluse is amazing in PvE. It honestly feels like holding a mini thunderlord (without the range obviously). It just absolutely shreds if you keep up master of arms.
---
I don't know why, but seeing the cylinder rotate is always satisfying
---
Eye's up guardian, or you'll fail the class
---
Nah, Mara Sov is queen, she‚Äôs higher than a bae, she‚Äôs queen bro
---
I was on a pretty good roll 2 days ago. From 700 to 1000 in around 3-4 hours.
---
Gonna be honest, absolutely using Revelry to my advantage. I'm a Warlock main, so all the Tonic is good for is grenades.
---
But since I got to 1000, I haven't won two games in a row at any point. 1 win, 1 loss, 1 win, 1 loss, again and again, and then the eventual 2 losses in a row, taking way the *tiny* amount of Glory I gained.
---
Pre-1000, I was actually genuinely enjoying Comp for the first time since... ever. I was being matched against those actually around my level, and nearly every game was close until the very end.
---
Now, Post-1000, I'm being matched against people with Luna's and Recluses. **At 1000.**
---
This feels a bit bs. I find it annoying that I can't get the weapons I want because of those weapons.
---
At this point I'm willing to do anything to get these weapons. I'm down to the point where I've switched to my Hunter and am using the Invis-Wormhusk combo. It's cheap, but it's basically impossible for me to lose 1-on-1's, especially while using Thorn.
---
Personally, I think there should be a system to prevent Pinnacle vs no Pinnacle player rounds. Like a 4 stack with Luna's shouldn't be matched against a bunch of solo queing sub-2100 players. Players above 2100 would be fair game, as they have the option to get the weapons.
---
please spare me...
---
It's ridiculous.
---
No way!!!
---
Arbalest is the closest thing we're gonna get to a low zoom sniper.

Why do people give great advice on pulse rifles, but not auto rifles?

---
Keyframes are the frames that 'encapsulate' an animation. If you were to have a shape on screen get from A(left) -&gt; B(right) with 10 frames, frame 1 and frame 10 would be the keyframes, with 5 being 'interpreted' as the middle.
---
You can add keyframes between those to affect pace, too, so having the keys at 1(left), 3(middle), and 10(right), then the shape would go from left-to-middle very quickly, then continue the path at a slower rate.
---
In the case of OP's animation, they're marking the keyframes where the picture (Servitor and Spectral) should move to, and letting the software auto-animate instead of literally moving the picture frame-by-frame.
---
No seriously, is there any lore saying that he‚Äôs reconnected with his sister yet? Isn‚Äôt she off playing with the nine right now?
---
Every arguing topic at this point is going to be argued into a circle lol. I see what you‚Äôre saying, I don‚Äôt see the points myself but I respect them.
---
This was my internal monologue as well.
---
I finally got it last night after my second run. Had the card set to arc and heavy and that was it! After the first run I applied a fire team medallion and on the next run it dropped from the chest after killing Nokris on first phase (9:40 minutes). Speed runs also account for loot protection.
---
Keep at it Guardian! I know you will get it eventually!
---
Means that each time you run it and don't get the drop, your chances of getting the drop on the next run go up. 
---
 I believe that it's to like 40% max, but it doesn't increase much for each failed attempt. 
---
I ran it for 3-4 days in a row with the emblem on for about 2-3 hours each night after getting a 100k run
---
Not exactly. That's a tracking feature that Adobe Premier has. It's basically a much easier version of keyframes where you just select the shape and let the program figure out the rest.
---
Drifter's weekly bounty is guaranteed to drop one piece of Gambit gear and he also offers one daily bounty that is guaranteed to give you a piece of his gear. Also randomly when completing gambit matches I've gotten additional bounties that give gear if you do stuff like kill 20 enemies without dying 5 times and stuff like that.
---
If you have the annual pass and go to Ada-1 in the black armory she'll offer an augmented weapon frame that requires you to complete some gambit-related objective. This is guaranteed to give you a gun as opposed to just a gear piece that the Drifter's bounties offer so it's a good way to narrow it down.
---
handcannons, pulse rifles and shotguns are the current meta. ARs are just too slow to kill and you get outshot by pretty much everything else.
---
I'm at work right now but I will check when I get home. I don't believe so
---
&gt;ANTMAN GOES UP THANOS‚Äô ~~ASSHOLE~~ THANUS fify

Soling the nightfalls is one of the funnest things in this game, IMO. Closest that I feel I can get to Legendary Halo solo. Also gives you a goal/reason to level up, namely to be able to do NFs alone.
---
It's so saddening seeing armour like this, it just comes to show how damn lazy the art team is now days in comparison to this beautiful set.
---
illusion 100.
---
congrats though, now get to grinding mountaintop. those gl double kills won't happen by themselves.
---
He calls you a snitch when/if you side with the vanguard, correct? (Haven‚Äôt chosen, yet)
---
Would Crimson work in PvP? Or would Better Devil's with explosive on it be better
---
yea. other than that there i'snt really a difference
---
Ok thanks for the information.
---
Use Riskrunner.
---
It's the perfect counter for the Skip Grenades. At Resilience 6, it takes around 5-6 Skips to kill me.
---
Even better in the Reckoning
---
It's a great day when you can experience some great gameplay with your kid! Beating raids have been so satisfying when I can help him thru and he gets his first clear and having him jump around all excited! Good times!!
---
Another question, what assault rifle should I use to do the breakneck quest?
---
crimson is decent if you have the catalyst, not sure about better devils, haven't used that gun in a really long time.
---
any 600/720 rpm rifle. you can pull year 1 valkydin from collections. it does decent work
---
Lol that‚Äôs sick, do you use the selfie emote?
---
ya snitch
---
Then why it's named competitive? otherwise CS:GO would've had RPG-7. Supers are no skill free kill, it's the truth. It feels more like OW and it's stupid.
---
I hear arcstaff works well
---
I assume so
---
Yeah they suck lol.
---
The best is when you kill one of the dogs on the tangled shore and it just starts floating around
---
The problem also is that the overall playerbase in the crucible is much smaller to what iit was at launch so all that is left is the hardcore, account recoveries, and sprinkled in solo/clans.
---
Without effort is a bit too general. You can outplay someone with heavy it's just difficult. Also Heavy ammo adds another dimension to the game which supers need to be used to secure it and snowball the lead. It is necessary for the game to be interesting and to keep some tactic even in clash and control.

1K doesn't count for the snipers/Linear fusion rifle kills. It is Fusion Rifle, and counts for the fusion rifle/shotgun kills.

They r forcing pvp players into pvp but that seems ok, i dont think u shuld complain, we need to do all the pvp to have a viable loadout! That u have to do 5 games a week for a powerfull reward or get a few kills in pvp i think really is fair, if its unfair its unfair for the pvp players
---
The horns change with what super you are using
---
Thought about using a strong Void energy weapon + Tractor Cannon and Tether for Vorgeth 
---
but I need to kill those damn witches first
---
Use Tonic if you're wiling and go top tree. You'll have invisibility whenever
---
Back in my day the only lfg we had was the tower
---
You basically are changing the games fundamentals (aka: making an entirely different game). Your points are basically this as I take them (this will vary for every individual) : make the enemies way harder; limit classes to be more specialized for one type play stiles (is sunbreaker is an excellent cc super. 
---
Side note: Take no offense but I don‚Äôt believe you truly understand the work and complexity of making Destiny. Adding all the other worlds and making the bigger is like a two year stand alone project alone.

Oh cool, Gambit prime is a game mode?

I saw a guy get the quest drop after a gambit match

Later, as in after the revelry is finished ruining the crucible for me?

He liked it so much that he died.
---
Preach lol I'm embarrassed to say that I have missed with celestial nighthawk far too many times
---
Just in PVP. 
---
In PVE you can absolutely wreck not having to reload and constantly being healed. I regularly switch between this and Graviton.
---
Wrong, and that literally makes no sense, in what game does picking something up give it to everybody in the match, you clearly speak in ignorance

thanks! hopefully it'll still remain useful. I usually pace my shots a little to make sure I'm landing those headshots, but if it's just going to be like any other 150rpm HC then I'll be better off using better devils or something along those lines.

She's gonna cry when she sees this

Still an actual nerf to a pinnacle weapon. And the 150 change is probably the biggest part of it. 180‚Äôs are laser beams compared to the kick of a 150.

What are the two handcannons on the right side

Haha thanks! Its definitely maddening but I really want that triumph haha, so I‚Äôll keep trying tonight

Congrats dude, really good job :D

Thank you so much! Super glad to hear that. Had to crunch it out cause it was real close to OP's birthday and I wasn't done haha.

Whether we wanted it or not, we stepped into a war with the hive on saturn

Seriously though, I hope they leave the recoil alone and just change the RoF, especially for console players

No I got that part, the rage for me was the hit box for shooting the gun out of his hand, so to speak. Hit box felt ridiculous.

As a warlock main I understand the truth of rule #7.

I doubt they will. They seem to want to make triggering Magnificent Howl harder, but make it easier to finish off the kill by upping the body shot damage. HC recoil on console sucks in general.
