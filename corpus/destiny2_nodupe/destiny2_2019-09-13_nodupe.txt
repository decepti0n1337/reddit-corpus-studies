I am very average at comp and have found myself being the one to push the lawn mower numerous times. Meanwhile, the enemy team all have riding lawn mowers.

So it sounds like he‚Äôs very partially explaining the mechanics to encounters in the Last Wish raid only. There are many things to know and go over for each raid but I will try to sum them up for you. Every raid has multiple ‚Äúencounters‚Äù that are like separate activities with specific objectives that the entire team needs to work together to complete. When you finish an encounter, the team will then run around and make their way through the raid map to get to the next encounter. For example, in Scourge of the Past, the first encounter has the team running around a city killing specific enemies and taking the orbs they drop to certain parts of the map. There is an actual map in the center that some of the team needs to guard and use to tell the rest of the team where to go. Once enough of the specific enemies are kills and enough of the orbs are deposited, the encounter will be completed and the team will make their way down into a maze. This is not an encounter, but simply a transitional area to the next encounter. They make their way through the maze, get deep into a cave, and start the next encounter there. The main thing with all raid encounters is that communication is key to success. You can‚Äôt have a single person not talking otherwise you won‚Äôt be able to do them. Of course you won‚Äôt always complete an encounter on the first try, but if the team all dies, it‚Äôll simply restart everyone at the encounter you are currently on. The only time it restarts the raid and kicks the team to reset orbit when someone dies is when that team has activated the flawless mode. As far as the time each raid takes, it varies with each team‚Äôs experience and skill level. If you have a bunch of people who are new and learning it for the first time, it will most likely take several hours. If the team has done it a lot or are very skilled players, some longer raids can be done in around an hour or so, and the shorter raids can even be done between 30 minutes to an hour. Hopefully this helps, if you have any more specific questions please feel free to ask.
---
Sounds like you're talking about the leviathan raid... You've got the basic parts, there are a number of encounters that you have to figure out and require a lot of teamwork and communication,while Being careful not to die.
---
For leviathan, there's the baths, dogs, the gauntlet and finally calus the boss. You have to work through each of the encounters which can take time. If too many people die or something doesn't go to plan then you wipe (everyone kills themselves) which restarts the encounter not the whole raid.
---
Hope this helps :)

When you're near a bad dude and you think you're far enough to throw the melee, you do a huge plunge and melee them instead

Check Spider's inventory on the tangled shore daily.
---
Buying from Spider in the Tangle Shore is always a good source, especially when he is selling the resource you want for glimmer or legendary shards, while also selling glimmer for legendary shards. The quests from the planet vendor also award a fair amount of that planetary material on completion.
---
You could try spider or put on a dual resource scanner on a ghost for titan and do bounties from sloane?
---
1. Spider.
---
2. Titan bounties.
---
3. Strikes or Nightfalls.
---
4. Public events.
---
That‚Äôs about it chief, not much tbh.
---
Check spider daily. Besides that using a ghost that can find chests/ resources while doing Sloane's bounties.
---
That is all? Just one gambit weekly challenge?
---
I am currently in a clan but they arent active, so I would be down to join, i am on PC and am currently not home so I will join here in the next couple hours if you are on PC
---
No
---
No, his weekly bounty. The one that requires you to do a specific thing in Gambit prime, and complete 4 reckonings of the highest tier possible for your account (for you, tier 1) after using the highest lvl mote you can make (weak for you)
---
Awesome, thank you so much!
---
[removed]
---
Zavala would love it
---
Bergusia forge has a chance of dropping them when completed.
---
Finish a rare bounty from ada-1
---
Before you ask, you get rare bounties by completing daily bounties from the black armory and it‚Äôs RNG.
---
Bro that's literally a tradition for a Chinese holiday rn lmao, gathering your family up during midautumn festival and eating around a round table.

#brioshe
---
Just trying to keep it easy for ghosts to rez new guardians!
---
Crucible is stupid anyway. It‚Äôs a pve based game
---
 Not even close+better devils is trash
---
No, I didn't start playing until halfway through Season of the Forge
---
Let's not forget the recoil animation changes for 150/140rpm Hand Cannons that should help make it more usable as well. The Sunshot I noticed is particularly hard to shoot quick because it's chunky frame blocks your sight picture when it recoils.
---
Theorized by people yes
---
i just saw this ;( thank you so much
---
And a damage buff
---
This is what I wanted for so long, my baby is back
---
No, because it too broken. Sure huge damage is fun and all, but at some point it just gets rid of all the fun and challenge.   
---
Imagine if got out of control and eventually became on the same level of broken as Lunas + Well. You'd get tired of only using that build for dozens of encounters
---
Sunshot as a HC also got a damage buff, like 20%
---
All hand cannons got a buff? Pve only?
---
^yoink
---
OEM and bottom stree striker are much more than just "debatable"

Mini mythoclast

We can‚Äôt forget that Crimson is gonna be buffed for 30.5 to the head

Mida + erentil= utter fucking chaos

5000 :(
---
You must not be using it right then? you can get unlimited ammo if used correctly.
---
Don't give it to me... throw it at bungie! I'l just buy shadowkeep with it. üòÅ
---
 Life happens.
---
I can just imagine all the stories being told
---
you know how enough blockers drains motes froom the other side?  send one giant blocker and it starts draining.  I just feel it really helps to be able to suddenly start their motes draining. espeecially if you send a bunch of other blockers with it.
---

---
It's one of the reasons that I've kept this gun as my primary exotic.
---
They are hinting around with using the menagerie for other events.
---
Nice,  I'll never get that lol
---
Who has time for both? Haha
---
This has happened to me with the fighting lion and with the colony.
---
I loved that gun but 9 shots was just too little
---
I'm working on the catalyst now with about 70% left to go on the sunshot kills... Would it be decent in PvP with the catalyst?
---
I did try for alternative ways, and I even look up for any changes to gambit in their website, no dice,  just waiting for the next reset to upgrade it once more is the only route. I kinda set my peace with this lost, like I did with MCU Spider-Man.
---
All kids in recess be like

[Someone mod the wooshing sound of the hammer being thrown to this pls](https://youtu.be/S4AmLcBLZWY?t=59)

You can go as an One Eyed Mask bottom tree striker Titan by just putting a trash bag over yourself...
---
üó£
---
I do this. Only because I have to get off no matter what.
---
They're really not difficult, just have some minor mechanics.  If you watch some guides to have a feel for the mechanics and find a sherpa, it's pretty cake to run through them.  Just make sure your group is aware you're a first-timer and they should be chill if you make mistakes and should help you understand the strategies.  Some people are dicks, but just avoid the "10+ clears KWTD" groups and you'll be fine.
---
You sure you don‚Äôt already have an open node that you need to go find for that quest? Usually that‚Äôs the issue with resonate stems and the quest.
---
No they have not
---
You could tho
---
No. I've never gotten enough to create a quest. I can just get rid of nacsent dawn tommorow and I'll be able to get the resonate stems again hopefully. Never even combined the stems.
---
Destiny 2 related how?
---
wHAT'S that?!!1??? it's DPS phase and you're kinetic AND heavy grenade launchers are out of ammo?!!!!! oh nooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
WAIT! I can use my recluse and still straight beastmode DPS phase. yeh there's reasons.
---
You know man
---
Technically rumble is the fastest too grind as far as playlist activities go, but strikes are probably more enjoyable.
---
Don't forget you can also chase after triumphs. If you can manage to find a team, you can coordinate and get most of them done.
---
Pair it with a pair of goblins or a captain and it‚Äôs magnificent.
---
I haven't. Apparently I was foolish to think I would've gotten it naturally after three resets.
---
Void blossoms
---
Are you on step 1? It‚Äôs been a while but I don‚Äôt think stems drop from random activities until you finish that step - to do 3 patrols and a lost sector.
---
Saving to read when it‚Äôs not 3am. But quick note before reading. There are those of us who know how to use swords as offense and defense in pve and pvp . Never let it be said they are useless.
---
Yes you can only deposit the tier 1 mote on the far left, the tier 2 mote in the middle and the tier 3 on the far right
---
Personally I feel like the best way to ‚Äúfix‚Äù OEM is to make other legitimately viable exotics for titans so there is more variety in the field of play. It is a very strong exotic and it‚Äôs already received a nerf and further nerfs with the state other Titan exotics are in would hurt the class as a whole. Also the reality is most players that die when they‚Äôre marked for vengeance die because they peaked a corner. The counterplay to being marked is to stay put and try to bait the Titan into coming to you.
---
It's not going to replace the spot my FL takes up, I'll tell you that much.
---
I did 5 resets before I got my first Dreaded Venture :)))
---
the best feeling, when you destroy some bot with a sniper and they said you hardscoped, then, they try sniping and get absolutely obliterated.
---
so basically getting shot ruins your radar and tunnel visions you onto just one target? yeah, no thanks. the counter to oem is this: kill them. if you are that unsure about your shots, then it doesn't matter if the titan is using oem or not. almost any special weapon will ohk them just like any other player and give no room for counter play. if you get tracked and start pissing your pants, you can A: when you are about to come around the corner where you know the titan is aiming at you, slide or jump out of cover and make yourself unpredictable, or B. just pull back to teammates for 8 seconds. if they are stupid they will chase you and meet your whole team.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
You mean I put on that spin show for nothing?
---
i will let them know and see what they say!
---
All weapons got base damage buffs
---
BUT are also getting large precision nerfs against minor enemies. Handcannons will do less precision damage to redbar enemies than they do now even after shadowkeep drops.
---
Yeah I went onto the destiny 2 discord to get those done.  Thankfully I did.
---
Le monarque. Exotic bow from the forges.
---
Is it in your inventory? No? Then not yet.
---
Just curious though when did you start opulence stuff because I started doing the menagerie and chalice stuff so late but I still upgraded it to max like a week ago
---
I hope they bring more vehicular missions out. I feel that was a staple of previous Bungie games. Well mostly Halo itself but damn they executed it well.
---
In my opinion since forsaken the destiny is in its best state ever since the franchise launched (PvP is a little ropey but there‚Äôs still stuff to strive for). 
---
There‚Äôs pretty much something to scratch every itch. 
---
Like raiding? Good because there‚Äôs 5 of them now. 
---
Like grinding? Theses loads of quests to keep you busy. 
---
Playing solo? The last 3 expansions have all offered matchmade activities which are all easily completed with randoms. 
---
Playing as a team? Hit tier 3 reckoning, heroic menagerie etc for that extra challenge. 
---
Want a long term goal? Check out triumph seals. 
---
The only dodgy section is PvP but you still have pinnacle weapons to aim for if that‚Äôs your bag.
---
Now we can go explode ppl in pvp even better
---
Ah I see thank you. I‚Äôm on the fence whether to buy Shadowkeep or not and was confuded about this.
---
I'm really curious to know what they mean by that recoil animation change. Are they gonna make 140 and 150 HCs have the same animation as 180s?
---
And shax. You can‚Äôt forget shax
---
And crispy on the outside! Along with your nearby friends.
---
I had the catalyst AND red dwarf drop today. God's be praised!
---
If you don't already have it, setup a light in the back, hurts less and you will feel less strain on the eyes.
---
Worse, it's the (B)est of Sunfall. Most OP recoil animation in-game.
---
Keep trusting Luke m‚Äôboy, see what happens
---
Ayy everybody
---
E
---
Not an exploit if it's literally how things are supposed to work. 5 paragon mods is wasteful anyway.
---
Doesnt really answer my question at all. But then again, I think everyone is in the dark for this one
---
If you were still farming it, I would say you could've made it gone by using like an LMG or a Snapper raffle. 
---
Still pretty impressive to outplay 4 people with a pulse rifle. (Keep in mind they all have access to heavy and special ammo.)
---
I think they‚Äôll be fine close to medium. It‚Äôs to stop them competing with scout rifles on pc haha
---
Go and pull West of Sunfall 7 from your collections. Then proceed to drool.
---
What's the buff?
---
Season pass =/= Annual Pass.
---
Damn, Swagger is praising the almighty SUNshot
---
Shadowkeep Digital Deluxe comes with the season passes for all 4 year 3 seasons. Year 3 starts Oct 1st with the launch of Shadowkeep.
---
Yea like SRL league!
---
Turn off Vsync and try again.
---
With the announced nerf to crit multiplier, a lot of the buffed weapons actually lose a good chunk of damage against red bars. Guess we were killing red bars too quick.
---
I like the current state of Khepri's Horn but this rework idea sounds really cool. I'd very much like to see it
---
It's the season pass that comes AFTER shadowkeep is released. 
---
You are looking at the current season pass. 
---
They are different things.
---
Not a buff
---
Increased damage against red bars in PvE
---
Cut red bar crit multiplier down drastically
---
Results in a loss of damage for precision weapons, but body shot damage buffed, so Recluse will only get more popular
---
OMG I NEED IT. The loadout thing is a must have for me
---
Okay, so I won‚Äôt be able to access the new Black Armory content until then?
---
Hey there, the season pass are only for passes which will release post shadowkeep. Annual pass which you are referring to are passes for the forsaken DLC which is a seperate purchase.
---
However fret not, If you already owned forsaken, we will get the annual pass for free 17th of september. I am waiting for this too ^.^

VSYNC is not on and neither in the Nvidia Settings as well. I use frame rate limiter in game.
---
Damn bro same for me except I can't get bygones out of all of it.
---
Where‚Äôs the guy who makes marshmallows
---
Where exactly are those patch notes? Been searching all morning for them lol
---
Every time someone with bygones interrupts my handcannon fun time I just pull out my 100+ range blast furnace and 2 shot them from some remote corner of the map until they submit defeat
---
I recently got an ornament for it and recollected the weapon that defined my legacy
---
Black Armory/Season of the Forge, Joker's Wild/Season of the Drifter, and Penumbra/Season of Opulence are part of the Year 2 Annual Pass. You must own Forsaken to access this content, and starting September 17th all Forsaken owners will be given access to the year 2 Annual Pass for free.
---
The Black Armoury content is not "New" it is roughly 9 months old. What you have purchased is Shadowkeep and the season pass for the year that follows it. You cannot currently purchase the Annual pass (The pass you were looking for) due to the transfer from Battle net to Steam.
---
Is your CPU overclocked?  
---
Do you run Corsair hardware by chance, with iCue?
---
Rangefinder negates 99% of range drop off in PvP and I‚Äôm assuming gambit, so if you have rangefinder with a barrel option that adds 5 or 15 recoil direction, Use that barrel, and magazine perk, the other perk(mine is zen moment) and Rangefinder and use a hip fire grip. I‚Äôve Ruined people‚Äôs day with mine and have even gone 28-2 with a We Ran using this scout and Rat King. Over 300 kills racked up on it in 2 days
---
Make sure that they're seated correctly in the correct DIMM slots on your motherboard to be running in dual channel mode. Check your mobo manual if unsure. Usually the slots are numbered something like
---
DIMM 3
---
DIMM 1
---
DIMM 4
---
DIMM 2
---
Place your sticks in 1 and 2.
---
I think I'll give my Mida some use soon...
---
The only way sweet business was killing people or putting out real damage was 1 if you ramped it up in pvp letting people in other matches know ahead of time you were about to round a corner and 2 with rally barricade/wells for a 900 round magazine.
---
I wouldn't say best, but most powerful for sure
---
And I can just grind these out of gunsmith packages right? 
---
Thanks for the reply &lt;3
---
Guess acrius doesn‚Äôt exist...
---
It might be tied to the raid like Acrius
---
Yep. I‚Äôd recommend steamrolling through menagerie these next few weeks as getting 3-4-5 guaranteed drops is easy parts and shards to buy planet materials ie simseeds and pawn them off to Vance for even more parts and MW cores
---
Acrius was an experiment of exotic raid quests that was scrapped when the next raid came around because people wanted exotic raid drops. I doubt they would make a leviathan 2. Giving raids exotic drops increases playability.
---
do you think is better to buy the delux edition (shadowkeep) or can i just buy standard and wait a month or so to buy passes? im a student and while i can afford it i dont like to spend 59.99 of my parents money at once xD
---
This was extremely entertaining to watch
---
Animations do not directly affect gameplay or physics. The animation can show sunshot pointing at the sky yet it will still fire straight. What is being fixed is that the sunshot firing animation will no longer have the gun firing seemingly mid-recoil and not pointing straight, or settling too early where it looks like the aim has reset but really hasn't and your shot goes off-center. Though I hope they make it easier to see where I'm pointing while firing too.
---
Look at the date of the quest release and then look at the date of the raid release
---
All the year one exotics that had catalysts drop from the faction war can now be found in strikes and/or crucible. You can check the catalysts triumphs tab
---
It is, but they require mod components and legendary shards (or is it the purple schematics? I can never remember that part, I just know I have enough of both and never enough mod components)
---
Weirdly enough, I hate and love it
---
Just get to your teammate that has lord of wolves and he will take care of the striker.
---
r/cursed_images
---
CPU not overclocked. Corsair hardware yes I do.
---
You could buy mod components from ada for shards
---
That is close to a perfect loop. Nice play Shakespeare!
---
I‚Äôm on console I don‚Äôt see LoW too often :/
---
and especially not with my ketamine
---
Dude I wonder if you can get an armor set that looks like the random people on the tower and just blend in
---
The quest might be tied to the Raid in some way (like Outbreak Prime). Or the dungeon, since their release dates coincide. Or, hell, might even be both for all we know.
---
Thanks bud :)
---
Depending on how low the multiplier goes, the 30% increase to damage might increase with the lowered modifier enough to still do decent precision damage. I'll wait until release to see how it turns out.
---
HAMMERHEAD READY AND LOADED
---
Hey man I'm always happy to help you with the raids if you need someone to show you the ropes
---
Crimson should be so gle shot, the burst aspect is what hurts it the most
---
Sure it wasn't the only thing, but she didn't wanted to have a grown man playing videogames, so it was a win/win. Shadowkeeeeep!
---
I would say that the card is the biggest issue. I got my gf a 1050 and it plays d2 very well. The 1060 or 1660 are probably a way better choice if you can afford it.
---
Beautiful
---
I have one with high impact reserves and Rampage that I‚Äôve been keeping in the vault while waiting for a scout buff. Glad I waited.
---
That's some big dick energy you got there, man. Keep it up.

Yup, I did mine 1 reset a season.

Wouldn‚Äôt call ya dumb for it. Lol
---
Yeah, that vid card is not good for gaming.
---
Are you looking to get an affordable card just for Destiny 2? If so, you can get an RX 580 anywhere from $130-190 right now. It won't futureproof your system for modern games, but neither will your processor, as some new titles list 4th gen i7s for recommended requirements.
---
Arguably, Sapphire Nitro+ is one of the better Rx 580s and you can get a new one listed on ebay for $180. If you're willing to buy one that's open box or pre-owned, the price drops to around $130 or so. If there's a TON of things happening on-screen, you'll get slight framerate drops even with this card. But it's not anywhere near bad enough to say it's unplayable.
---
If you're trying to get a better card for other games coming out in half a year or so, I'd grab one of the ten series from Nvidia or the next-gen AMD stuff.

I thought this was a perfect loop for a min
---
Nechrochasm didn‚Äôt make you wait after the raid was over to get the gun. It required you to complete every raid encounter
---
I‚Äôd also like a PVP buff to sidearms. Not much, but being able to kill in one less shot on a high RoF weapon with bad aim assist would be pretty nice.

That way, I could actually play with Sturm and Drang

This was so cathartic to watch thank you.

I'm sure you know you get helmet from bounty, you get 1 a week and have to have gotten the previous tier to get the next one. You can also get up to tier 2 helm on alts in their first week of reckoning / prime as the other 3 roles helmets that you didn't do the bounty for can drop. You're out of time now and you have no one to blame but your own procrastination.
---
It‚Äôs a 1 buff + 1 debuff rule,
---
For example, I were to use Empowering rift and a hunter uses a tether, both will be applied since one is designed to increase a players direct damage (only one or more adds for tether and only 1 for MP) and the other increase all aspects of damage for a period of time (if the rift runs out or you walk out of it).
---
However, if another person were to also use a MP, then the MP‚Äôs damage debuff will be put into affect and nullify the tether since MP does just a tad bit more damage (rendering tether useless, however unintentional coding made it so tether would nullify MP even tho MP does more damage, which is patched RN or will be in SK), this is also the same with rift if someone was to put down a well.
---
So within SK if someone was to put a well and bubble down, the bubble with take priority for damage with it‚Äôs weapons of light buff but will not remove the healing aspect of the well while also allowing you to also have a bubble over shield (the healing and damage aspects of well and bubble have different coding, and IS intentional (over shields too have different coding, well bubble combo xD), you can find more info on this in I think Chapter 2 or 3 of one of the lead directors, brilliant 1k+ paragraphs explaining Destiny and Bungies past, present and future for the company and franchises (don‚Äôt forget that Bungie to working on with a Chinese company, I believe) which is easily found on Bungie.net üëçüèª.

I sometimes just equip it instead of my weird beloved or max range tatara gaze cause I had just got it after the nerf that reigned it in was in place.

Yeah that‚Äôs happened to me in strikes a lot
---
Wallball! Good times.
---
Do you have the gun? No? 
---
Will losing change that? No?
---
Get in there and play lol. Its 300 points you can do it.
---
The only OP about bottom striker is the cost of R1. If you use it normally instead of brain-dead spamming R1 all the time its perfectly balanced. My guess is that the regular R1 perk is activated by the super‚Äôs R1.
---
I would hope people understand the risks involved in giving a stranger access to their accounts ...... you shouldn't have to remind them :( ...... but some only see the end restult

An you'll be able to point at the titan when they start asking for wells for boss DPS!

Love the Mega Man music!

Nope. VEIST is completely new to Destiny

PvE &gt; pvp
---

---
I don‚Äôt know but what I do know is that it doesn‚Äôt correlate to a raid challenge
---
When were pulses not viable in PvP...on PC they are second under HC and no clue on console but last I heard they were tied for 1 depending on range.
---
Or the shadow blights instead of using them to get the buff
---
Me every time*
---
*everyone liked that*
---
You mean you don‚Äôt know and you don‚Äôt know if it correlates to a raid challenge. 
---
Lot of condescension coming from somebody who has no idea what the steps are m8.
---
Hunter punch &gt; titan punch
---
Cayde is the best. Yea I like diff char, but its crime here ;-)
---
There are high tier pulses. Blast Furnace obviously, Go Figure, exotics like Vigilance Wing or Graviton are still good. I see Bygones still from time to time. But a lot of the middling stuff, mainly older stuff, just doesn't stack up as well. In the right hands ANY gun can be good, but obviously Destiny is a game of metas and loot. Kinda tough to bring The Marine into PvP versus all the handcannons and high tier pulses and do awesome unless you've got more skill than your opponents, generally.
---
That can be one perspective. But let‚Äôs say the cost is increased. That would not stop titans from still being able to heal from a kill in their super and quickly move on to another target negating any damage they did towards them. It would also suck doing three dashes and having your super halfway already. 
---
If I could contemplate a nerf it would have to be changes to the perk which starts health regen. I would make it so that it doesn‚Äôt regen health during super kills. This would make it about in the same boat as dawnblade. 
---
Furthermore, it would promote a more high risk high reward environment which supers need like golden gun. Titan will still be able to chain kills but will have to be more careful about how they approach groups of enemies.
---
Likely because when something in the game is broken, it usually gets fixed. LoW got nerfed rather quickly yet OEM only got a minor nerf and still is a problem in pvp. So, those who play pvp will be upset and speak out about it until a change is made
---
Looks like Xur really wants to get rid of that Chromatic Fire
---
I am Big Dick Tarkus, and he is small dick Iron Golem. 
---
(Hope i got the right quote. LoL)
---
Next time. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Something random isn‚Äôt always scattered and new, random is unknown and anything AND everything could happen. Getting the same 3 Warlock exotics is just very unlucky RNG. Having something completely random would have an instance of this happening.
---
For some reason, that lumina quote hits me so hard. 
---
May our fellow guardian rest In peace.
---
Perfection.
---
I would be so fucking proud if I pulled that off, haha!
---
Hallowfire Heart is a solid performer if you run top tree Sunbreaker... Let's you put melting point on stuff more frequently.
---
I'll be picking it up because I run FR/PR build and this has perks to match, although they're not amazing.
---
You‚Äôre right, but you overestimate the skill and thought process of the general playerbase.
---
General thought process is ‚ÄúTitan got an overshield for killing me, broken‚Äù and not ‚Äúdamn dude I missed literally all but one shot, that Titan hit them all, they deserved that kill‚Äù
---
I think is just Calus Selected?
---
Someone please tell him about overstock.com
---
is it getting nerfed again:()
---
Says something when you need a grenade, grenade launcher, A fusion rifle AND a melee to take down a striker...
---
Nah, Bungie delayed Shadowkeep so only the strong who survive the Area 51 raid can get to the Moon. Or the ones with enough brainpower not to go
---
Yup. Use Prospector and you‚Äôll end up putting the flag where nobody can get it
---
Good play
---
So it takes: a grenade, a grenade launcher grenade, fusion rifle burst, and a melee to kill a striker titan.
---
So then it seems a nerf to pulse and HC range would indirectly buff them.
---
Or europeans
---
The Season Passes are what grants access to those.  The Deluxe edition of Shadowkeep comes with several Season passes.
---
Europeans are also free to join, just remember to switch your servers
---
It's surprisingly easy! I've been running double specials exclusively for a couple weeks now, you just need a scavenger perk for each weapon type and play it cool until you get a brick. Revoker is training wheels for this playstyle, but personal favourite is mountaintop/beloved.
---
Running shotty sniper is great too, people do not expect a chaperone in the face when they rush a sniper around a tight corner
---
Impressive gameplay!
---
As long as you have prepared for the Migration over on [Bungie.net](https://Bungie.net) at the PCMove page, you're good to go.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you have not done so, then you need to do so.
---
I just jump off the map and hope they follow me and die too.
---
Now this is an Avenger's-level threat.
---
Ye
---
Ok üëç
---
Yeah when The banner is almost placed
---
‚ÄúThe Cabal seat of power now resides in orbit around Nessus. In a giant fish.‚Äù
---
That line made me choose The Drifter.
---
Ah, gotcha. Thanks for the info!
---
Forsaken will be available on October 1st on steam, I think the price will be $24.99.
---
Just blow your entire load in their face
---
Ok cool
---
I‚Äôm not familiar with rocket jumps :/
---
Oh cool I‚Äôm from Ireland üòÇwe can finally get itüëçüèΩüëçüèΩ
---
What is xur?
---
No problem
---
Yea I love that bit before you grab the tank. It gives you that feeling that your so small and that place is so big
---
I‚Äôd be happy to help ‚úåÔ∏è
---
https://newfastuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/77movef.png
---
What spot is that on the map?
---
I think it might have to do with porting Forsaken to Steam because IIRC Forsaken was supposed to become available on Steam some time after Shadowkeep, so once they got the definite date, and with Borderlands releasing, they decided to postpone.
---
Is this map going away? Because I actually really love this map.
---
Oh wow, than I completely misunderstood their messaging. So you‚Äôre saying seasons are cross save, DLC is not?
---
What gun?
---
Rat King is Titan
---
It‚Äôs up in a building by the C flag.

Alright fair enough
---
Yeaaaa I get quite a few, especially curateds. Don‚Äôt even mind tho cuz that‚Äôs easy Core farmin!
---
You shoot under yerself and it gives you a jump boost. Works with soldier since he's the only one who has an rpg as a main weapon
---
To kill them, ofcourse
---
I'd say more like stupidity, but it does feel like racism sometimes  #stoptitanabuse
---
So, then I got the quest on my warlock for no reason?
---
Not only that but you remained completely untouched. 
---
The very few times I‚Äôve been able to shut down a striker I end up barely clinging to dear life or plain dead along with them.
---
Impressive
---
You aren‚Äôt supposed to get up there though
---
Ive never really thought to use proxie over spike in pvp tbh. I like chesting people who are in the sky with it all the time.
---
Me after 6 hours of farming: 14 outlasts, 6 bug out bags, 1 spare rations. Thank you bungie.
---
I'm gonna be honest, outlast is pretty nice though, and it's getting a buff soon. My recommendation is to get full auto on, makes it easier to aim and shoot, rather than having to spam the left mouse button as quickly as possible
---
I won in a fist fight with a striker 
---
I used liars handshake with tip tree arc staff
---
He just meant that I put some distance between myself and the striker before I started dropping everything I had
---
Honestly, when i used it to reach 5500, i hardly ads with it. Threw on shotgun targeting and hipfired mostly and it was pretty decent. I would ads on supers though but normal people i would just hipfire it with shotgun targeting.
---
Probably for Mida Multi-Tool then
---
It's actually a 25% nerf to damage overall
---
You have to jump up through a death zone and then you'll probably fall to your death. It's more for the memes than it is any real use.
---
You can't stop it, it's self-sustaining now.
---
No Feelings with Box Breathing on it.
---
Oh no lmao, I was wondering if that‚Äôs what you meant(I used to play Halo a lot), all I was doing was sticking a grenade to the floor so he‚Äôd walk over it
---
they just took a recording of an angry russian man on halo and put filters over it
---
Yeah if you have at least one other person with you. The set up I used was anything in the first slot, Recluse in the second and SotR in the heavy. Technically the barricade or Luna well isn‚Äôt needed but it does help a lot even though xol has like no health so the DPS phase is short
---
How is it an Easter egg
---
Got skyburners oat upon loading into a raid, i swear there are a plethora of underused weapons it‚Äôs awesome.
---
Nice
---
Alright, thanks your help
---
&gt; hand cannon recoil fix
---
What was wrong with hand cannons? I've played this game for a couple weeks but I really like them, are they getting buffed.
---
No problem. Good luck guardian
---
Dude! Destiny 2 challenge coins!!! Count me in!
---
Even the strike had some wild things going on. Turning guardians into fucking crystals to power the hive. Wtf I wanna know more.
---
Nah but fr what‚Äôs up with the hunters and have 30 eyes on a mask. It‚Äôs overplayed at this point.
---
Unpopular opinion but i really like play support warlock in destiny. I liked well and lumina
---
What i read in bl sub it has tons of glitches and crashing clad i went mhw: iceborne and wait to see how its working
---
hahah old chum, this was indeed comedic. i will now transfer you some internet points
---
Someone explain this to me. It appears they just ran out of time.
---
Bungie is great at giving a familiar location a new look. The plaugelands on earth is the best example.
---
‚ÄúThis......is the Noisy Cricket.‚Äù
---
Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking when I stepped on the platform.
---
You get the rare bounties from the daily ada bounties so you can do 5 per char per day.
---
Looks like when you find your ship in the first mission of D1
---
29/30 bullets, "i have to reload NOW"
---
Just keep telling yourself its all about the motion of the ocean
---
Wha-

As I watched it: waffle...man...dude....bro!!!

Painting for sure, bone ornament.
