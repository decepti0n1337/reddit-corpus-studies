Looks great my dude

---
---
Dudette, actually! &lt;3
---
if u havent gotten bad juju by now im done
---
Now look here you little shit....
---
listen we don't eat raw crayons ok! we melt them down first obviously!
---
Titan main here: true for most of us
---
:P dude, duddette, what's the difference we are all guardians here :)
---
I'm fucking crying real tears.
---

---
Have an upvote
---
yes! the raid is on saturday
---
Vigilance wing used to be glorious. Especially with the full auto catalyst.
---
Like some of the others replies mention, nothing synergizes with Liar's like a One-Two Punch shotty. Swashbuckler would be the better between the two you mentioned. Liar's would allow swashbuckler to stay up a little easier. Keep farming guardian!
---
That's one way to get rid of ur frustration from gambit

When my kids ask me why the sky is blue I just tell them to fucking google it already.
---
Thanks
---
Did you have that one guy that doesn't give up and still shoots you? Haha
---
No lol I have. This is a long time ago.
---
Are you working for minimum wage in Uganda?
---
so im coming from xbox and want to play tomorrow. Should i buy it through Bungie?
---
lol, you know what I mean!! ^_^
---
Yeah it is! It‚Äôs also fun to just mow mobs down with a huckleberry or recluse and then pop my well when the boss appears and destroy it in seconds
---
Combine 4 shots into one and you'll see it's true strength
---
Jotuun can only drop on a gold frame. So, that's 6 chances per week if you have 3 characters.
---
That accuracy was utter shite
---
Nice! What a finishing move!
---
I didn't know that. Thanks!
---
I mean granted this stuff was free and didn't really give you any loot aside from a few pieves here and there. The new pass has gear + power with it.
---
I yelled so loud in excitement that my cats jumped and stared in frustration at me.
---
i got to blue, turned in all the bounties i saved up and said, the blue hunter armor doesn't look that bad
---
GOOD NEWS, EVERYONE!
---
The battle pass isn't the problem, content for the new seasons leaving after 3 months seems like more of a problem to me
---
I mean, I learned something from almost every comment you made, and you gave me the idea to go into the console and run a couple basic executables. You were a big help :)
---
Welcome to classic destiny
---
yeah it took me like 1 day to get the titan and warlock green done i did both in same day then 3 days for each blue
---
I got mine 4th run.  Before that I got monarque, lord of wolves, black talon
---
Thanks.
---
Underrated post
---
Well if that's the case FML
---
Shots fired in Compton?  As in Compton, California?  No big surprise there.
---
thats tough but at least you got it...i got mine last night, but no where near 239......i only did the 2 per week with radiant frames
---
They did to the point it isnt stupid OP, but it is still a mighty strong gun.
---
No idea I just saw that post and was  pretty confused by it I have no experience with compton
---
thought this too, got mine last night but skipped Season of Drifter......so maybe 30 ish runs
---
Troll lol
---
Then I'll give you some tried and true advice. Get Gud
---
But did you die?
---
I agree. Except the Taken captain in d2

As a huge Halloween fan, as well as a Warlock main. I grant you this upvote ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

You: Parry this you fucking casual
---
Vandal: *does*

Ok I‚Äôll try to grind for and see if it drops, only negative thing is doing strikes takes foooooreeeever like it‚Äôs so boring
---

You should probably start spamming "E"
---
I could‚Äôve had a more meaningful conversation with a door knob

Yeah I have that happen to me all the time.

Congrats! I was able to get both Hush and 21 Delirium at the same time.

Oh boo hoo, let me press F on the world's smallest keyboard

I think the intrepid sets were the only thing you couldn‚Äôt  obtain via bright dust.
---
Oh. That's actually amazing.
---
theres always one tbh
---
What's that music?
---
No, and this won't happen.
---
Often this is an additional powerful drop for players.
---
Perhaps I'll try üëÄ
---
sadly yes... but i pulled a cool triple kill when they all came at me
---
Wheres the code? Tried and it doesnt work the one youve highlighted
---
I understand this reference
---
It had to be somebody
---
Right away sir sorry sir
---
It was probably used already. Figured I‚Äôd only leave the picture up for like ten minutes.
---
Competitive is kinda rarded right now tbh
---
It would have said code has been redeemed, with the highlighted one , it just says invalid.
---
Hi, this might not be the time or the place, but how would one go about getting that tag next to their name? Asking for a friend :)
---
I gotta admit i was expecting a Skyrim starting cutscene when the screen went white
---
As a warlock I can do any role I have the gear or class setup to do it
---
I also used it when trying to get a few clips for the video. It's very fun!
---
dude I am not running Xol 300,000,000 times.- he is like, the worst boss next to the tangled shore freakin' 3 phase boss....like it takes me 20 minutes to do Xol on a decent run with 2 other muppets...thats like 4,166+ days of nonstop Xol, and thats not even including tea breaks
---
Gnawing Hunger is pretty good in PVP.
---
I play the field
---
That's an icosahedron, not a dodecahedron.  It's made of 20 triangles, instead of 12 pentagons.
---
Nice! You nailed the shape of that Nighthawk helmet! Maybe try add some more of the key colour and detail to the Ace of Spades, and try some other exotics too! Keep up the good work!
---
me titan me punch thing hehehehehe good
---
As long as you don't play OEM, I'm fine with that
---
I use an open hand slap to send my enemies flying so I can skeet shoot them
---
These were part of the Black Armory puzzles back in the Season of the Forge. They've all since been solved and serve no purpose in game.
---
Your hunter looks like Cayde
---
Aggressive Warlock, I see.. pretty rare around here
---
Mind always beat body, don't forget
---
RIP Doc
---
I misspoke, sorry.  Any Guardian that does *at least one* qualifying Nightfall during the challenge will receive the emblem should the community succeed.  So at worst you only need to do one per character.  I mean, it would be worth doing a few times if you have any quests that care about strikes in general or Nightfalls in specific, but I don't believe doing Xol or Nokris that obsessively is necessary.  (It would also *help*, but would come at a ruinous cost to the player who tried it, so I don't recommend it)
---
Good strategy you got there, ready to help whenever you Fireteam needs you
---
10/10 this gun kills things. I'm sold.
---
Each season will be available to purchase separately later on, so I'm planning on just buying Shadowkeep. I am not totally sold on this new season structure, which is why I don't want to buy the digital deluxe edition up front.
---
Found the shotgun ape
---

---
Wendigo is a fixed roll and does not have Spike Grenades.
---
You can tell it is a fixed roll because you can pull it from collections.
---
It has Blinding Grenades.
---
*HEEEEWWWWBOOOWoooonnggggggg*....
---
Ohhhhh.... So THATS why they're bankrupt.
---
Wait, Bad JuJu is back in D2?
---
I think you mixed up hunters with brain dead warlocks and titans lol
---
Did not know that one.  Thanks!
---
You didn't know about that? It is an old way to check for loot
---
Technically I think it would be a glitch, I think the range is tied to your viewpoint so by zooming in it shows the icons at the range of your room and not the intrinsic scan range
---
I used to use it to rush resources and glimmer when I didn't have forsaken. Definitely useful
---
Which is why? Because they're garbage?
---
And you don‚Äôt have to actually. Shadowkeep doesn‚Äôt require any previous DLC
---
To be clear, didn‚Äôt the last article from Luke say that you can also purchase season of the undying without Shadowkeep ?
---
exodus down set!
---
so many reposts of this
---
No matter how.much you play, if u dont own battlepass u only get top row rewards.
---
If you do, you get both rewards
---
Saint 14 (lines)
---
Very much appreciate the compliment, but I still got quite a ways to go haha.
---
Time to go back to the drawing boards
---
Its not my face when it happens
---
Yes it will, should it happen I does not update right away just go to orbit and it should update
---
Good job, Guardian! That machine gun is an absolute beast in PvE.
---
Woah John wick on the scene
---
Been in the game since D1.
---
Just so you know...in case you dont want to run into fire and die. You can cast a giant impenetrable shield while running.
---
a game like destiny will never have balanced pvp, people need to finally understand this
---
Delete this disgusting picture
---
Please use the search bar this question has been answered repeatedly on both this sub and the other sub multiple times per day
---
That‚Äôs not automatic, man, I have to use (flick) the stick to do that. Appreciate it tho. Four kills as well. Everyone seems to forget there‚Äôs four kills.
---
he could also just run OEM and bottom striker and just never die like all the other titans
---
Thank you for the help!
---
Battle passes don‚Äôt kill games though?
---
V O I D
---
This man is hacking, instant ban
---
Your notifications bar is stacked.
---
If you buy the digital deluxe edition, you get the next annual pass, battle pass and some preorder extras
---
Except those things arent the issue? Every other weapon archtype besides handcannons and to an extent shotguns are actually quite well balanced and all are roughly on the same level. The core issue with destiny 2 is the terrible maps, which is fixable, and the overly heavy reliance on supers and general 1 shot kill mechanics rather than skill which is also fixable. As for actual heavy ammo all you have to do is increase the CD for it and have it give less and problem solved. No matter what a nade and rocket launcher and shotgun and such is always going to be a 1 shot kill and that's okay, just like Halo. The issue is how frequently and easy to access those are and how the maps are designed around them. 
---
The actual weapons themselves are fairly easy to balance because on a well designed map as long as someone isn't facing a 1 shot kill weapon or mechanic, skill should always win out. 
---
So no I don't think Destiny is that hard to balance sorry you won't convince me otherwise after the 1,000 hours I have in it and 20k I have in Halo lol. 
---
Here's hoping the upcoming changes to PvP fix these things and it sounds like they will.
---
One Pike  for a glimmer
---
2 void subclasses?
---
Spin it however makes you feel happy. 
---
 It comes with the seasons.  The seasons replaced the small dlc releases.  It's fun content and I was going to get the season pass regardless. Now I got a cool rewards system exclusive to each season,  fucking badass. I'm sorry you can't be excited about the change, on the other hand I'm counting the days until Oct 1.
---
I like the game a lot.  I want them to keep working on it and adding new stuff.  This helps fund the game in a fun way.  I see no negative.
---
Yeh, that was the point of this video.
---
*A roving band of pikes*
---
You didn‚Äôt get outplayed once, but twice. However the last one was by far the most humiliating
---
Normally you do find good people but not always. One time, when I was running through the  Scourge of the Past raid, one person on our fireteam got the exotic sparrow on one of the encounters and just left without finishing the raid.
---
If I remember correctly it's boots, arms, chest, class item and then helm. Not 100%, helms definitely last.
---
Sorry gummy bear, but my ‚Äúnegative post‚Äù was just pointing out that having a 1-shot, tracking, quick and giant disc and killing three guys isn‚Äôt impressive.
---
Man, we gotta believe that Forsaken+S2 will be &lt;$35 when D2 launches on Steam, right?  I mean there's no way they'd sell the "old" xpac+season for $40 like it is on sale now, let alone $99, when the NEWEST xpac+season is only $35.
---
I bet when Forsaken appears on Steam it has the season pass, and it is less than $35, because it'll look really weird/stupid to have it sitting next to the new stuff and be more expensive.
---
I‚Äôve fully read everything and I still am not convinced.
---
K.
---
Nobody here or myself thought it was impressive at all, if you feel the need to be impressed from the things that make others happy, I feel bad for you dude ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Well then what‚Äôs the point in posting it??
---
The base game didn‚Äôt have much content, and much lower light level then with the DLC. All the year one content and the ability to explore the currently DLC locked planets is going free to play in October anyway, but IMO it‚Äôs still worth it to get Forsaken for the sheer amount of content it adds. An additional campaign, The Last Wish raid, menagerie, the planets Tangled Shores and Dreaming City are just a few things included with Forsaken, as well as a max light level of 750 until Shadowkeep drops. If you don‚Äôt have the year one DLC Warmind and Osiris(not sure if the base game includes them yet), then it also includes those and adds Mars and Mercury and their respective campaigns.
---

Thank you for your explanation.

I‚Äôm more impressed by that roll. That‚Äôs the second ‚Äúperfect‚Äù DRB that I‚Äôve seen!

How about no.
---
Joooooooooooooooojooooooooooooooooooo
---
Pfbtbtbtb not only that, I want more exotic auto rifles
---
[deleted]
---
Agreed , ( warframe player here ) warframe should be an example of good studio and good fan base relationship
---
This is half false. Anyone who only got Shadowkeep will follow the top path while anyone who got the season pass (included in the deluxe edition of Shadowkeep) will follow the bottom path.
---
Kill? No. Give you a chance to kill, sure.
---
Me too, activities like strikes, crucible, forge and heroic missions are horrible to do as a solo player
---
And you can stop breathing my air.
---
There has been 0 hint that currently released DLC will be taken away. Since we all bought it with the expectation it would be permanent, it would be a real dick move to suddenly take it away.
---
Get those Motes to the bank! It's time for a Primeval!
---
But sidearms have the best DPS in their range for primary ammo guns, sans SMGs. If anything, the rifles all do subpar damage compared to everything else, they all need a buff (but at least Scouts in Shsdowkeep should be much better).
---
"New Light" is the base game, Curse of Osiris, Warmind, and all the other stuff on that list being free to play.
---
So if I buy it on battle.net do have have to buy it again on steam?
---
I got one reset in after 94 matches ugh. I guess 100 more to go fml
---
No pc is one platform. Battlenet will all transfer to steam
---
*Dusts off 18 Kelvins*.   
---
      
---
**Let's do this.**
---
Please no. Titans don't need an extra one hit kill in PvP. They've got enough already.
---
No, content purchased on bnet will transfer to Steam. So if you buy it on bnet, once D2 switches to Steam, you'll still have it. It just doesn't cross between consoles because of licensing.

From the [Shadowkeep and cross save FAQ that we also have stickied to this subreddit:](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/by457o/faq_shadowkeep_cross_save_free_to_play_and_more/)
---
&gt;&gt;When cross-save becomes available, am I going to have to rebuy all of the game and DLC that I already own on the next platform?
---
&gt;As confirmed recently at E3, yes, you will have to buy DLC again (Forsaken, Shadowkeep, maybe Annual Passes) if you're going to be cross-saving to another platform.
---
You can do all the raids 3 times in a week with different characters.
---
I got tractor cannon from xur‚Äôs fated engram and then the catalyst less than a minute after by doing a heroic public event. I thought I was lucky but DAAAAAAAMN!!!!!!!!! Congrats
---
Wait, are sidearms being buffed. I reeeeeaaally don't think they need it. My 18 Kelvins murders people, and burst sidearms have crazy ttks.
---
Hell, buy forsaken because it's really good and it comes with the first 2 DLC's. IF you like it buy shadowkeep for even more to do.  
---
Shadowkeep will NOT include forsaken. Play thru as much as you like,  come October 1st everyone gets bumped to 750.
---
If your into looter shooters this game stil have you playing for hours,  I'm almost at 1800 hours myself.
---
Seeing the recent Bungie news post about how future DLC will work, it really seems to me that Forsaken + annual pass is worth more, because it permanently adds stuff to the game that you can play for as long as you want.
---
When in doubt...chuck the shield

IDK, I'm conflicted. While I think that free exotics are... distasteful, I can see the frustration of never getting an exotic(Liar's Handshake), but it hasn't released yet, but since it's free, I'm leaning towards a positive opinion of it.
---
*pat pat*
---
am I the only person who uses it in PvP I rarely see it anywhere
---
We have threesome
---
all im trying to say the dodge look different
---
I remember when Forsaken first came out if you pulled it it was the cleaned up version but they changed it soon after to the damaged version
---
I used to do everything the game could throw at me, then I realised I was doing chores and not enjoying myself, these days I couldn‚Äôt give a noots hoot about half the content, I just play for fun now.
---
Halfdan-D with kill clip and a range MW is pretty dope if your tracking is on point.
---
Yes, you can keep playing. You can even see the battle net to steam migration page update as you do stuff. For example, if you had 2 characters when you first linked accounts and it shows on the page that you have 2 characters, you can make a third character and check the page again and it will show you have 3 characters.
---
Agreed the armour ever since D2 launched has been shit
---
Suros is the best pvp auto in the game.
---
It has a higher chance to proc the healing effect, along with having better recoil direction
---
ahh nice
---
No because they're are plenty if weapons that are as good or better.
---
BEANS
---
Luke Smith as uldren. Lol
---
Yeah, already mentioned all that and, my damage numbers with a full court spike doomsday with both interia and knockout in a well do on par damage as a void spike with tractor. However, there's still a 33% buff with tractor on top of. So, continue to be a meta only player and listen to YouTubers.

Traveleres Chosen and Sorrow MG2 outta be the new meta

Damn I'm on xbox sorry man. But for sure just keep at it. If you get too discourage take a break.
---
Except you do. https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48097 Premium track is earned alongside normal track, and the hc is rank 1. Normal rank 35, it actually takes MORE time for free than I thought.

Just because you play a hunter doesn‚Äôt mean you have any skill.
---
Beans means Heinz
---
Oh, let me be clear, I was not talking about myself. A blind man could aim better than me
---
Izanagis burden
---
Okay cool. I did not know that. Thank you
---
Sorry, I'm a hunter; my grenades are ass
---
Ah. My apologies. In any case, you can find success with any class. But each class has drastically different play styles and each subclass plays pretty differently as well. You can be a good hunter and be a bad titan. Or a good titan and a bad hunter. It all depends on how you like to play.
---
I don‚Äôt think so. I was grinding Strange Terrain for Osprey and my boyfriend who was helping me got the gun in less than 5 runs with a 6k top score. I got in about 15 runs with a 20k top score doing 5k runs.

That's kind of my point. I am absolutely terrible in PvP, and most days average a 0.8. kinda hard to grind to recluse with that.
---
I don't think I did? My friend also got Destiny 2 when it was free for PS Plus users, but he can still do Forsaken stuff without having actually bought the DLC.
---
Ahhh Husky Raid...where did they go
---
Started with the black armory weapons first...this is Enrty #3!
---
Riiiight I see 
---
So either 
---
you can farm the weapon on the correct weekly rotation
---
But another way to obtain is by achieving the medal within prime related to the weapon your trying to obtain.
---
I never did solstice
---
Is she thick in other places?
---
It happened to me on my quest. It just takes time to update
---
Pvp is the only place i run them when im not doing quest steps for something else. Im interested in seeing what this buff will do in pve.
---
So you're saying that OEM is this games Twilight Garrison?  I mean I get the hate for it but each class has their crutch exotics so not really sure why it's that big a deal.  If you want, put on St 14, pop a bubble, grab your fav shottie, and wait it out.
---
I always get hatemail for using middle tree striker, it's so much fun and literally my reason for maining titan, oh did I mentioned I got hatemail IN QUICKPLAY for not using bottom tree..
---
Get to level 20.
---
&lt;\3
---
No no your playing with tards who plays with morons who run shotgun ape and your too stupid to know how to counter that. Look plain simple don't mean to be an ass and hate saying this learn how to counter things
---
There's some curated raid gear, does that count?
---
Whenever, just send me a msg on Xbox and I‚Äôm down!
---
Really depends on their rolls. If I find one that has better rolls, i.e. grave robber, outlaw, rampage, etc... I used that over anything else lol
---
You need to create the channel then under permissions assign rolls for the channel so you would add charlemagne as a roll your admin or founder or both and @everyone then in the channel type the command from the link above so for xur you would type !server xur on.

Spare Rations, Last Man Standing, Hammerhead, Blast Furnace, Kindled Orchid, Waking Vigil, Twilight Oath...

I'd use sidearms if they weren't a pain to my finger.
---
Most of the Black Armory weapons are very popular.
---
Some of the Menagerie weapons.
---
Raid weapons.
---
Gambit Prime/Reckoning weapons are really good. Wait until September 3rd if you want these, as a drop rate buff will be released then.
---
But these weapons are only good with good rolls.
---
Bumpin
---
No prob. Telling you man start w/ small changes and work your way up. But after I reworked fundamentals it made me twice as good. Learning to not sprint around when I saw red on the radar and sliding making you disappear on opponents radar for a sec made a big difference.
---
For what PvP or PvE? Some raid weapons are good for both, the Ikelos weapons from EP are valuable in PvE (the Shotgun is a must have), and if you‚Äôre a crucible guy the Dust Rock Blues and Mindbenders are good. Bygones is excellent in both PvE and PvP. Really depends on the rolls of the weapons for just about everything though
---
I didn't know about the sliding trick. I'll have to try that out.
---
Awesome!  
---
My wife and I  game together, but she's hesitant to play d2 because it's an fps. I'm slowly winning her over by waiting until she walks by to pop a super and pique her interest.

I'm sorry I didnt read the names I thought you where the other guy. I'll agree it's broken but can be countered and I play with some pretty good guys I forget my ELO but I'm always against sweats who 6 stack with OEM not forgotten dust rocks

No you will not be able to access them via PC or Stadia. Any expansion bought fora certain platform will not carry over to all platforms. It must be bought for each one.

Seriously tho, happy to hate-like ur happiness.
---
Thanks. I thought that, but a clan member pointed me to a post saying otherwise. Thanks again.
---
I don‚Äôt think you can,I think you need the corresponding dlcs to play on that platform.
---
For example I only have year 1 and vanilla game on PS4,but I own every dlcs plus annual pass on PC,I can play my PS4 account on PC,but I don‚Äôt think I can do that on PS4 since I don‚Äôt own some of the content.
---
The Meta is real.
---
I‚Äôve never had an exotic drop, and the catalyst at the exact moment. You lucky dog you.

It just seems like some want to complain for the sake of complaining...like the latest top posts are about the raid armor just being Y1 armor reskins. To me that seems highly unlikely since the armor was pure white..and if they were gonna reskin, it would be the skin from the D1 raid, which isn't a bad thing imo.

I may have my little complaints, but I'm mostly happy with where it's going. I might actually enjoy comp now that solo queuing will be a thing and gains/losses will be based on individual performance. Scouts are getting a buff (which my Night Watch is SO ready for), and Armor 2.0 looks awesome.

Big ass knights in ascendant challenges, use a Tincture of Queensfoil to become ascendant

Same here, have had colorblind glasses for a while, but only recently played with them on. Looks incredible

There's no resisting a Titan's fisting.

Yep big knights in the ascendant challenge. You'll already be ascendant to get in there. But you just have to wait for the challenge that let's you kill them.

Subbing to r/titanfall is always a good decision tho

Spam it I guess haha I can usually get 4 good ones out.
