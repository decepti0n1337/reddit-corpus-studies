Just throw moar grenades!

---
---
It would be easier looking up a video.
---
Ok
---
I actually got hate mail the other night cuz I watched that video and spent a solid 7-8 games kicking shit in the face almost exclusively.
---
Pair it with Liar‚Äôs Handshake/One-Two Punch Shotty &amp; Thunder coil. üëåüèª
---
Wow just wow! He would not be happy. Unless that little duck can punch you in the throat!
---
Especially on a well with a tether and hammer titan debuff.
---
Hence the ‚Äúfail‚Äù part bud.
---
Just dont delete the titan. You can have 3 characters.
---
Yeah but light level doesn't make a difference in IB does it?
---
No need to delete your Titan what alot of people do is have one of each character.
---
^^^^^^
---
Nah, I tought the guy was hacking when using this helm because it looks like you have infinite melee energy. Today I got mine and punched 25\~30 people in my third pvp run using it
---
Me too, I started just when the April update happened
---
Why delete the Titan at all?
---
F
---
Anyone else seeing the 2 faces on each side?
---
Are those tied to the expansion?  Bc the standard ones are awful and the blink for arc strike causes it to run down really fast
---
You could just not delete your titan. You have three character slots, use them.
---

---
But no. Weapons, collections and triumphs will carry over, quests will not.
---
You can do it!!!!
---
Why delete the titan? You can have 3 characters. I have one of each class
---
Mhm, to be honest I rarely use exotic armor anymore but I do enjoy synthoceps and Peregrine Greaves. Fun exotics that tend to be forgotten.
---
Hunter/Warlock: ‚ÄúHa! Foolish Titan, you have the reach of a T-Rex!‚Äù
---
Me with Synthoceps: *Teleports behind you* ‚ÄúGuess again.‚Äù

Don't make me lose nnn on day 30 plz

That is partially incorrect. The only things that won‚Äôt transfer over are quests/ bounties and your inventory. (not consumables)

You can also transfer items via the vault or the various apps

We must create the destiny purity strike team. Plenty of r34 out there, but it‚Äôs nothing A few surgical strikes won‚Äôt fix.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm over 2 years late and didn‚Äôt bother searching before I yelled into the void about my rare drop‚Äù
---
Lol what? You can see the light level while it‚Äôs in your inventory/post master. If anything you would need to have it all equipped when you pick it up off the ground/go to orbit and send it to you post master.. if you were being overly cautious.
---
And keep grinding Randy‚Äôs Throwing Knife‚Äôs quest.
---
And that‚Äôs why i dont play PvP. I thought this was a first person *shooter*
---
Yeah man I appreciate the insight honestly you're way more level headed than a lot of people I've come across in youtube comments or friends that have switched lol. People always wanna throw jabs at PC being easier or what not but nah man I'm sure being 5500 on both systems you're playing pretty tough people dont sell yourself short on my behalf lol.

I just read it with his voice, damn it‚Äôs the same effect as a Morgan Freeman picture

Thank god I didn't buy the game till forsaken

‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling it‚Äù
---
I feel bad for the REAL titans like you that automatically are assumed to be a stinky poo poo-head.
---
Nope. They game recognizes all equip-able gear for calculating your current max PL, no matter where the gear is located. It can be in the vault or on another character, not even on you let alone equipped on you.
---
**ESPECIALLY** Peregrine Greaves! lol
---
:(
---
Keep it together, guardian! You can do it!
---
Jade Rabbit, she‚Äôs been my baby since Taken King
---
nice
---
i 100% guaran-fucking-tee that hunter and warlock mains will continue and infinitely complain about OEM until it's banned from pvp. it's main perk, Vengeance, is the main problem of it, not the slow health regeneration.
---
sick beat though.
---
I miss the D1 knight design. It looks so awesome.
---
No one said it mattered it just funny to see a child like you get so worked up just like the rest of your huntard friends do.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs kind of weird to have social only modes when video games have more socially awkward participants than any other activity.
---
I guess I can‚Äôt express opinion üò¢
---
ALL OF YOU TOGETHER
---
LIKE ORNA MENTS.
---
Duke mk 44 is my go to if for pvp. Opening shot with kill clip. Best 110 imo.
---
[Depends on the overshield](https://reddit.app.link/sLXlnUZc31)
---
Double the bullets is a bit of an exaggeration, but it‚Äôs still 1.5x
---
You're on PC, so you should be using the "destiny 2 PC lfg" discord server
---
Pretty sure this is zero hour
---
Dont delete titan. You share stash.
---
Are you high? If you‚Äôre using burst glide it‚Äôs the fastest way to move in the game. To the point where accurately controlling yourself in that super is considered a skill in itself and is key to dominating an entire pvp map.
---
I never knew myself why folks kept throwing them at me in that strike until I joined a clan, it‚Äôs not intuitive about he power increase sadly! They should glow brighter or a different colour as a clue maybe?
---
**To new folks, passing the orbs to another fireteam member increases the shield breaking power of the orb to break it in one shot!**
---
Cayde got laid back in the day before we played when he could raid pre tower enslaved but the story had to be saved and eververse has to get paid.
---
Shaxx is the most Wholesome Guardian in Destiny (1 &amp; 2). Change my Mind.
---
Thanks Shaxx, that made my day better. Thanks OP, for not telling me to throw more grenades. Grenades won't make my day better, they'll get me arrested in my state.
---
We stack them in 100k runs lol
---
I believe the reason you only see OEM in PVP is because all of the other titan exotics are considered obsolete compared to it. Hallowfire heart (my preference since I don‚Äôt have OEM) is pretty good and allows your abilities to regen way faster when you have your super, but it‚Äôs not game breaking. I think hunters have it the best right now since they have some good exotics like the crown (forget what it‚Äôs really called but gives an overshield on dodge) and frostees. Not sure about warlocks
---
&gt; It would be to confusing otherwise
---
FTFY
---
Go ahead and wait, don‚Äôt even buy foreskin until the sale when y‚Äôall can buy both. Took me a month after buying the foreskin dlc to even start the content and another few weeks to consider spookybois dlc which I bought yesterday
---
Pretty sure Melting point untethers now, and I‚Äôm not sure if Well and Tether stack either. I don‚Äôt think Ward of Dawn does either :(
---
She gett bulied on a daily
---
Outbreak
---
Same with erentil. I think fusion rifles need some kind of rework because with a god roll they‚Äôre OP. Even when you sneak up on somebody with them and start firing they usually still win the gunfight
---
An auto rifle based on the thunderlord
---
Oh wait, this isn‚Äôt Titanfall Reddit...
---
Qell fook me sideways that's lame
---
I will admit as a titan sometimes i think I get some pretty cheesy kills with the shoulder charge abilities, however the other melee abilities (bottom tree striker, without shoulder charge) are usually pretty trash. I think hunters have a pretty good melee ability with the disorienting ability. Not sure which subclass that‚Äôs part of
---
Tried to copy it as good as possible.
---
Yes he‚Äôs the one officer...
---
Bro I was so confused at the Destiny 1 cover art: like I thought he was facing forward the whole time but he had his gun in his hand backwards and I‚Äôm like What the Hell?
---
The only other place where light level matters is if you are invading or are fighting an invader in Gambit.
---
I‚Äôll fuck you before you get the chance to fuck me!
---
Grenades are bad for guardians too, and shaxx is still asking us to throw *those*
---
A pity rookie never cut it as an ODST
---
Sadly this is true,also basically all npcs talk about Cayde‚Äôs death even if you don‚Äôt own Forsaken
---
The common argument is Foetracer's tracking is not consistently applied, which is true enough though it requires looking at the target and nothing else so im actually willing to huck that up to server/peer lag making it hard for the tracking to proc. Additionally the damage bonus on Foetracer appears to be bugged and not calculating correctly. 
---
Sanguine Alchemy, never used it personally. Most arguments I've seen are it traps you in the rift and therefore isn't nearly as useful as OEM... no, nobody talks about the damage boost/healing/arc soul they get along with it. Nobody seems to use it so why would they. Until i get my hands on one and test it out im throwing it in the "underrated because it's not a plug and play exotic".
---
It‚Äôs not even that bad of a nerf I‚Äôm still gonna be mad when a oem titan gains all his health back from killing me
---
Meep
---
Agreed! However I think if they tone down the special ammo again, it‚Äôd really hurt the flow of PVP collectively. There should be some kind of perk or something that rewards snipers imo, since they‚Äôre not as easy to use as shotguns/fusions/maybe even subs. I‚Äôm not sure what would be a good solution for this, but it‚Äôs a good subject to look at
---
Get it because Titans bad hunters good
---
Also how do you grocery shop?? You get to the register and pay for everything then hope they send them to you a week or a month from then? I hope your not an adult with the logic of you shouldn't get what you paid for. C'mon Tommy.
---
What is a gunsmith bounty, the one i get from banshee i suppose
---
Everybody posts this screenshot all the time. Just stop.
---
Oh. Ohhh. Oh no.
---
Not even that bad of a nerf, maybe if they got rid of the wall hacks it‚Äôd be fine
---
It would be a disaster. Even when you build a fireteam a randoms, shit is questionable. Matchmaking would just lead to people leaving after 1 wipe.
---
yo, gimme your discord
---
Thanks I was having a perfectly fine day...
---
Its not masterworked, but I have alottttt on my Play of the Game:  Used it to get Mountain Top.
---
Oh wait, my Sarcasm detector failed me there........
---
Sweet! Thanks for enlightening me on that. Much more hope for next season now
---
I love playing a casual sunbreaker
---
ROAD ROLLERDA

Bring the Recluse. A good grenade launcher will help. Whatever you feel good with for kinetic should be fine.
---
No champions so mod how you feel.
---
COLONEL NOOOOO

Raids would be a no go. LFG is bad enough.

I believe that if you go to Zuvuzwela there's a golden pistol that looks like the Ace of Spades

*slurrrp*

Got a similar one on Nessus near one of Cayde‚Äôs stashes
---
Go check Amanda. She has an option for you to replay the whole campaign, from the start
---
I love titans because of their subclass abilities
---
Don‚Äôt forget that mf‚Äôer misadventure
---
Of all time?
---
F-MEGA
---
It‚Äôs a good thing every one in the PvP community adheres to this year old post that has barely any visibility; like I said wrongful misinformation. 
---
In theory any player could solo a few players, that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre in a special/ability meta; a warlock with handheld supernova could kill 2 players with a single button press. 
---
That‚Äôs why theoretical ‚Äúbattles‚Äù are bs. A single hunter with a shotgun COULD wipe a team with over shields and a single player with an over-shield COULD wipe a team. Whining about other players and abilities in the game instead of focusing on counter-playing them is just excusing your own losses and lack of strategy. If you‚Äôre being tracked then don‚Äôt peek maybe? If you find an enemy with an overshield and you don‚Äôt think you can beat him, maybe don‚Äôt try and then cry after you die? 
---
Just some thoughts from a 5500 titan.
---
Wasn't sarcastic tho. Just try it but in pvp... :O
---
So this is where Chiitan went after susaki kicked em out.
---
Not really. Seeing how a lot of armor sets look the exact same through common to legendary. Plus I'm not asking for this to happen right now. It would just be nice if all armor sets could be used as ornaments eventually.
---
üòÜ
---
Well, since Play of the Game is basically the same thing....I guess i already have.
---
Just fall, It won‚Äôt kill you. Maybe
---
They don‚Äôt want you to be able to just roll for a new exotic every weekend, it makes you more excited when you get an exotic world drop
---
Would highly recommend you watch this 
---
https://youtu.be/aJkAgTMpnaU
---
Again, sure. But you don't log on to have great team chat.
---
Facts!
---
&gt;	Me throwing a grenade ~~in PVP~~ and not hitting anything
---
Is there anyway to fix? It's giving me ocd lol
---
I will be one of your aimless fire team members
---
Maybe they don't have it? I don't have it myself.
---
Well, I guess I didnt use ONLY that.  I used a primary and PotG when I got the heavy.
---
Bruh, getting wall hacks for being shot is not good game design. You shouldnt be punished for shooting someone. Go watch cammycakes on YouTube if you want to see how oppressive the item is.
---
The fact that most other wallhack exotics require some setup or a kill makes it even more broken in comparison.
---
If you‚Äôre talking PvE then yeah the OEM is fine as is.
---
I run Izanagi‚Äôs, recluse, and love &amp; death with spike grenades and full court.
---
Noooooo its still too soon the only character in the entire million dollar franchise with personality
---
Chill b. My PC is fine
---
Not that I know of :(
---
I like to call him lord salad head
---
I would just nope it right outta there
---
Nah, wow requires way less talking, unless you are top of the line mythic raiders everything can be done with text chat and add ons.
---
Eyyy! Got my Jade Rabbit in Volundr unloading Wardcliff on a psion
---
except I've gotten 10+ exotic world drops and they haven't been the monte carlo and with that I'm sure I'll get plenty more that are duplicates of what I already have. I shouldn't have to rely on RNG to get every exotic weapon. That's probably the worst part of the game is the RNG for exotic drops
---
I‚Äôm tired of all the people who constantly complain about shoulder charge while being in the lowest multiplayer brackets in PvP. That‚Äôs my issue. You guys either need to equip a shotgun (which is an easy counter btw) or just learn how to aim and watch your radar.
---
There sould be a statute at tower were you can interact with just lile it was him and do things
---
Oh yeah that's a thing
---
You are correct it‚Äôs designed for new light players that want to play the old campaigns
---
Well, currently, only exotic I have is this vampire brace thing (cant remember the name. Melee kills heal, though. That's how I remember the vampire part)
---
I honestly thought this was posted on r/Gunpla because I saw the unicorn first üòÇ
---
Satisfying to watch
---
I just think that every (ACTIVITY) set should be ornamented for others of the same activity.
---
I think the Iron Banner armor should be able to use all Crucible and Trials armor as ornaments.
---
I think all Nightfall gear should be able to use all Vanguard armor as ornaments.
---
Gambit Prime gear? Can use Gambit gear as ornaments once they go down to one mode (I vote classic despite liking the perk progression).
---
Maybe Planetary set that can use all planetary sets as  ornaments, a Calus set, et cetera.
---
This would give us plenty of options without requiring 1000 ornaments on every piece.
---
That, or totally decouple armor from appearance but I can see why they don't want to.
---
For add clear, my favourite is Prometheus Lens. I use it in at least one encounter of every raid. My teammates usually think it's One Thousand Voices and I'm about to blow myself up, haha. 
---
For DPS, it's hard to beat Izanagi's Burden. Whisper is also very good, but I don't like the Whisper scope as much.
---
In the Crucible, my favourite exotics are Suros Regime or Cerberus+1. Cerberus is definitely a love it or hate it kind of gun. Armor wise, when I am a warlock I use Ophidian Aspects or Contraverse Hold. When I am a hunter I use Foetracer, and I do not play pvp on my titan.
---
Honestly veteran arrogance could be worse. Players that have never done raid content could assume you can jump into it with no prior knowledge as long as you have a high light.
---
that was actually a really cool hidden gem, unfortunate that many have not seen or appreciated it.
---
mindless add clearing huckleberry for sure, wanna cause explosions, ace of spades with that swaggy reload, dps probably 1kv, whisper or prospector, izanagi with catalyst for short dps phases. crucible is use whatever you like tbh.
---
Wow, he speaks. Is it coherent or have you learned to understand what certain sounds mean?
---
YYYEEEEEEESSSS!!!!!
---
Nice! üôå
---
This is almost as bad as Fry's pup waiting on him...
---
Imagine having to use abilities to get health!
---
This post was made by Liar‚Äôs handshake gang
---
Where is u/fuckswithducks
---
I tried it for Leviathan once.
---
The group was German and all left at the second encounter.
---
I still call it light. Can't break the habit.
---
The chest with the transponder? It varies. You need to go to the location that your transponder says. Track the quest and when you get close it will point you to it.
---
The first part of it? Its right next to the campfire with thorn in it. You need forsaken for you to get any of this.
---
karnstein armlets for warlock right, i was referring to exotic weapons though, since you can only run 1 exotic armour and weapon at a time. best tip i can give you for the final boss fight is to just run around and hide, best if you run bottom tree void warlock for the healing grenade and heal on kill, if you're the last man standing just run and hide until your people respawn and then slowly kill the boss, rushing will only get you overrun
---
True, I mean most players now most likely have that mindset. ‚Äú I hit 950 so I can do end game content right?‚Äù
---
if i look up my weapon changes.  sometimes if i look down it'll change as well.  just seems to happen once my aim passes a certain point above the horizon
---
I've found this to be true for myself in the past as well, yet I still can't bring myself to hop in with randoms. I have a hard time talking on the mic with people I know irl lol it's ridiculous
---
Bitch ass complainers after the oem nerf:
---
*iTs sTiLL BrOkEn BuNgiEe NeRf *
---
Wouldn‚Äôt really work unless it was somewhat east because iron banner is an event and isn‚Äôt always active.
---
So uhhhh final cosplay?
---
yep... this is why i don't raid
---
I mean you could find 3 other people and have them just sit in the spawn while you do your thing
---
There is no in-game option for this. If something says it has matchmaking, it will try to give you a full team no matter what. 
---
Edit: There are ways of preventing you from matching with people at all, such as changing firewall settings on PC, but I have only heard of these used for strike farming. I would imagine it would not work at all for pvp game modes.
---
Yep, that's why i was searching for glitches
---
And here we see an example. Point proven.
---
It do be like that
---
Yeah, but some invader with the super on could go and finish them off, primeval heal. I'm just trying to do this as a challenge like how people do solo dungeon
---
Should I focus on my stats I need which is Int/Dis or go for high power stuff?
---
There is no intentionally triggered glitch that will create a 1v4 gambit match that I am aware of.
---
Fuck it
---
Frame drops
---
Oh cool , do let me know if you come across one
---
Lol no.
---
and this is like the third time
---
Sniping is incredibly easy in this game but so is damn near everything else. Snipers don't ruin PvP. PvP is not a skill based thing in this game. The complete lack of balance makes it a skill-less environment.
---
Or disengage.
---
Also it's a two way street. If the guy facing a oem is useless so is the oem. Also yes all the tracking in the game is really freaking stupid and personally wish to have them all be removed besides flawless that's just needs a rework so it doesn't work with one shot weapons that way spectral doesn't become completely crap, but that means reworking a few exotics and most of them would be bland af. Also it's bungo so ya.
---
It's a reskin of various armour pieces I believe. Three Hunter helmet is a reskin from Eververse helmet from Black Armoury with slight adjustments, the cloak being a reskin of one of the Leviathan raid cloaks (I think SotS), legs are from a previous IB set. Even the Warlock robes are a reskin from before, just don't remember which piece.
---
The sets aren't completely reskins, but toy can tell they take the bases from other armour pieces and have slight alterations to them, so not completely unique.
---
You can do all the raids except for the newest one because they‚Äôre all 750 light.
---
the one on the ups ide ?
---
This is nightmare fuel
---
...Have you ever used it?  It takes a second of aiming to start tracking, as well as sometimes removing the tracking randomly after you stop aiming, before the timer would run out normally.
---
Not sure what  platform you play on but ever since I put D2 on SSD for my PC and Xbox X's , the game loads a lot faster and I don't even have enough time go grab a glass of water before I am loaded to the press A screen.
---
‚Ä¢:(
---
Too much thermal paste.
---
*in my best Winston impression*
---
"Excuse me for... dropping in" Lol
---
Actually RATS together strong
---
You should know that a Ghost and a Vex Harpy are two completely different creatures. That being said, I'm sure he'd love either one.
---
Everyone whines about OEM, but they don‚Äôt realize the powerhouse that is Khepries Horn.
---
Y‚Äôall think I‚Äôm joking? 
---
Use Khepries Horn against a super, or a whole team. See what happens. Who needs OEM when you can throw a barricade down, and shoot out a torrent of death. It‚Äôs easy, especially with Arc Battery. Oh, y‚Äôall thought I was joking didn‚Äôt you. I‚Äôm dead serious.
---
Honestly the closest you're gonna get is setting up a custom game and putting everyone on the other team. I don't mean to ruin the fun, but I think matchmaking/team filling will prevent you from playing an entire game alone since there's no way to automatically load in solo
---
Man I miss the old Lighthouse. One of the greatest moments in all of gaming for my whole life up to this point was finally getting there after being total shit at pvp for so long on my crusty ass PS3. I want Trials back so badly. Curse of Osiris feels insulting to such an experience.
---
I want the wing contender as an ornament, or just let me pull it from collections, that shit was fire.
---
Thanks for the reply! I‚Äôm on PC.
---
Just do 3 riven cheeses and a queenswalk every day. You‚Äôll get it some time. I mean, I have a friend with 48 Scourge clears and no anarchy, so...
---
No, off the top of my head I think only the enhanced reloading mods have non artifact versions. You can see a list of mods in the Collections tab, where it will show which ones you have found and which ones you haven't.
---
Am i the only one who actively had to farm for spirit bloom
---
20 plus really isn‚Äôt that bad since you can do 3 rivens and 1 queenswalk in like 1.5 hours, there are people who have opened way more chests and haven‚Äôt gotten it.
---
...yeah, point being? You‚Äôre comparing Erentil to a sniper rifle right now. Lul.
---
I'm exactly in the same boat. Learning the last part takes so long if your team isn't coordinated. It's so easy though once you get the hang of it. Unfortunately this can take a while
---
That's just how network in destiny 1/2 works. Not just console, it's the same on PC.
---
Step back, take some deep breaths, and think, ‚Äúis this worth ranting about online?‚Äù
---
Thanks a lot, a truly helpful guardian
---
Theres new exotics!!?! Lol
---
I‚Äôd agree. The thing that feels the most underwhelming (other than the paltry amount of damage it does in PvE) is the DoT that barely tickles guardians and mobs that step around where you landed afterwards
---
You could have just put "Garden of" over salvation, come on.
---
But what about ari ari ari ari ari ari
---
#Arrivederci
---
I still keep getting shield disorient or threat detector
---
Crazy luck I think
---
1. Bungie doesn't go here
---
2. 20 is not all that many compared to what I have seen.
---
Same thing happened to me, I think that exotic drop can be only one of a few things, and we are just super unlucky
---
There is finishing the collections for the Vex Offensive which requires the Strikes, Gambit and Crucible emblem quests.
---
There is the 3 Ritual Weapons. Then the different kills in Vex Offensive for weapon type 
---
Not sure what your collections part looks like but there really isn't any steps to it. Got it last week when I got the ship from doing a 980 Nightfall.
---
It's. . . whatever you haven't done yet. When you go to the Undying seal at the bottom of the triumphs tab, there is a button prompt to look at all the different requirements for getting this title. You need to do each and every one of those. There are no steps, you can do them in any order. 
---
When titles show badges, you can view the badge on the right side of the Collections tab.
---
Nova Bomb now updated to comletely crash opponents computer
---
So the only two I don't have is the Power Bonus and the Precise Assault. So I have to just complete those two I take it?
---
Ive done sotp lw and cos all over 10 times and i still havent gotten the raid exotics. Im sad. Ik there are people out there whos done like 100 runs without the exotics but damn do i really want it
---
It really does, yeah. I use the Sunshot a lot and have been wanting the same customisation ability so everything matches. Plus ornaments are so hard to come by, and the options are super limited in terms of colour options. Hopefully Bungie patches it in sometime - I just posted on the forum which has no guarantee of gaining traction and being seen by the devs, but even a small chance is better than no chance at all.
---
People really be out here defending OEM like EVERY SINGLE CRUCIBLE MATCH doesnt have at least 3-5 titans wearing it, most of the time paired with recluse or mountain top lmao
---
&gt;Does it not take into account contributing damage, or is it just for killing blows?
---
Correct, it is just for killing blows. If you want to do bounties that ask you to get killing blows, you just have to get killing blows.
---
ROAD ROLLER DA
---
Yeah I just now learned that there's a Seasonal Tab. I saw that I was just one triumph away, seems I got my answer.
---
Taken Phalanx. Anti-barrier don't work on those.
---
dear god the pic quality is bad, spike, autoloading and rampage i think? it's an ok roll. best GL right now would be love and death with spike + field prep + full court though, swarm is no longer BIC
---
This is what the end goal is, this was the first season of testing it.
---
I have Thundercoil and synthoceps on bottom tree striker and it never one hit kills anyone at full health in pvp
---
This is normal. Most nightfalls have an exclusive item that randomly drops only from that nightfall. For Inverted Spire, it is that ghost shell.
---
I will pay top dollar for one if you ever decide to make another lol
---
don't you have to complete the forsaken story before you can go to the dreaming city? or did that change with new light?
---
What about primary ammo Grenade Launchers :^)

You can view this information in the weekly reset post we have stickied in this subreddit. 
---
[For general information on what an ascendant challenge is, see the appropriate section of this guide.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1879075949) I don't know if you need to complete Forsaken for it.
---
Punch punch punch my dood. Happy cake day sir!
---
There is no power bonus that is required. I haven't hit the triumph for that an I have Undying. Check the Seal itself it will tell you what you need.
---
I have 1 from eververse, lets go to pris... woah, i mean collections!
---
Hmmm, sounds like hunter talk..
---
I guess I'm not done here. Perhaps you can learn to be a better man if you take *this* post to heart.
---
Please elaborate on how my explanation of the build somehow implies I "took this to the heart". Please also explain, and think heavily on this on your own time, how that's a bad thing or is somehow an insult. Your attempt to take a moral high ground here is as embarrassing as it is ironic. Someone taking something seriously, getting upset, or tryharding (as that's usually also something people who say these things use as an insult), is nothing to be ashamed of. Using those things as a sort of insult only makes you look immature, unintelligent, lazy, or a combination of those things.
---
Being a hypocrite also doesn't make someone wrong, btw. I can take your ignorance seriously and still tell you to take less-serious things less seriously, they are not somehow mutually exclusive. Writing a paragraph does not automatically imply someone is taking something seriously either. In this case it means I felt like explaining it to someone who clearly didn't understand, that I enjoy typing, and that I'm putting off finishing a two and a half hour video and using reddit as a break.
---
Assuming you can rub your two brain cells together long enough to crank out more words than will fit in a Twitter post, I look forward to your response. Please take your time and try not to let your emotions run your life, or write your words, for you.
---
Ngl d1 helped me a lot in overcoming social anxiety. I wanted to do d1 raid more than I wanted to avoid talking to other people
---
i‚Äôve been using bottom tree dawnblade a lot lately for phoenix dive. it‚Äôs a great little recovery hack because you hardly have to be airborne at all to activate it. but also, using it from really high up in the air is super cool. it‚Äôs like making a grand entrance and you don‚Äôt even take fall damage no matter what
---
I really hope they bring hawkmoon back
---
This season these have been our main new loot sets: Dreambane, Vex Offensive and Garden of Salvation.
---
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but if my basic addition skills are correct, that adds up to more than 1 set of loot.
---
(and try not to use emojis pls this is reddit)
---
Personal preference I guess. I still find it helpful as a way to get a breather when you‚Äôre surrounded by ads and majors, or when you want to wean down a bosses health quickly. Besides, there is no feeling like mowing down 50 thralls while listening to ‚Äòbfg division‚Äô on your ps4 playlist in the background. Or at least for me.
---
Yeeeee
---
Unfortunately I already have exotics in my secondary and tertiary slots, so space is limited.
---
I mean, the voice actress that she's modeled after is pretty damn cute
---
True, but not the same. Mine was set at 900rpm auto kinda like a misfit with a punch.
---
I still get nauseous and will be shaking before raids. I‚Äôm getting better but my anxiety rules every single time.
---
escalation shotty is pretty damn good also
---
Thank god for the steam F2P release, never have to suffer this bullshit again...
---
Oh wow. So 2 new armor sets for a DLC. Um, no in my opinion that‚Äôs not good enough (and who cares about emojis on Reddit, seriously)
---
Clearly it's Xol, the legendary Hive wormgod who we defeat in a strike
---
Use burst glide for basically everything. Activate your glide immediately after jumping to go higher. Activate your glide later if you want to go more horizontal.
---
Make use of sword/relic skating. Jump, melee with relic or light attack with sword, then activate your glide immediately after pressing the attack button to launch yourself forward.
---
Too soon!
---
Same thing happened to me with graviton lance, first exotic. Messing around, and bam! death by drop pod. First time one had ever killed me too.
---
Quackis morne
---
Fuck those strange coins. Now they pass out legendary shards like its candy! I used to have to walk 6 miles uphill for 1 strange coin!!
---
You can also just buy Season of Undying. Which I wouldn't do, it's really not worth it, especially now that it ends in a few days. It comes with Shadowkeep, which does hold quite a bit of value
---
Just fuckin join lfg discord and hop into a voice channel. That‚Äôs literally how I found my fireteam with who I‚Äôve been playing ever since.
---
If your on PlayStation we could be friends, I‚Äôve also been trying to get over social anxiety
---
I will do that today. But is warmind and Curse of Osiris completely pointless then?
---
Will do man there‚Äôs a quest to play it anyways and I think i have bounty‚Äôs to do
---
Thanks man will do!
---
Use your super. It bypasses servitor immunity and stuns them out of immuning eachother.
---
Well they could implement voice chat feature in the game, that‚Äôs how epic got around it with fortnite.
---
Any tips on leveling up quickly? I don‚Äôt even know what gambit prime is so I won‚Äôt be doing that at all
---
Not to be rude but your set up literally has no dps. Two primaries? Also the last word in pve?
---
Between bounties and the Undying title lots of ppl may just be grinding for certain weapon kills instead of playing the objective
---
I do too... but that doesn‚Äôt mean it wouldn‚Äôt be nice to have on the switch üòå
---
This. Last time I did a raid was with all my friends, and Leviathan. Now everyone has a life and I am just me and my girlfriend. Every time I suggest doing an LFG, we both look at each other and say no
---
I'd rather two man the raid if I could!
---
If you're on PS4, over 18 and really want to start raiding or are curious, or don't want to run content solo anymore, hit me up with a PM. will go through them as they come.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll remember this next time because it happens more often than not.
---
I mean, obviously im a stranger online, but i can do at least a leviathan with you. Dont need a mike and given a bit of warning i can get a crew that dont care as well. I like to think im friendly but i haven't met me
---
where can i get these :3
---
I will do! I‚Äôll get on that grind as soon as possible and I downloaded where is xur so when I get what he requires I‚Äôll be on that as soon as I can
---
I play as a Titan main but I'll switch whenever I finish all the stuff I want to do that week on the Titan
---
Not ridiculous! Took me months to talk online after someone said my voice sounded weird lol

I‚Äôm not anxious or anything, but I‚Äôd take a shot at those raids with y‚Äôall. None of my friends want to explain the fights to me and I can‚Äôt do it alone lol I‚Äôll add you if you don‚Äôt mind and when these guys reach out to you, we‚Äôll make a team and get some loot
---
What hand cannon is that?
---
It's specially hard when English isn't your first language. I'm a native Spanish speaker and the Latin American community is...really rough, so to speak. 
---
So I'm fine reading commands or listening to English, but my pronunciation is between abysmal/unable to speak the language; and the last thing I want is americans laughing and giving me shit for my accent, so nah, I'm good being mute and playing for the mission before going off on my own way.

I do offer comission services! I'm stacked until christmas, but feel free to contact me through my Instagram: @heart_soul_productions

i feel like he just gave up on life at that point
---
That was probably my longest, but most interesting build yet. I can build most model kits of any grade in about a day, but this kit took me well over 2. Super solid. He spends most of his time on that stand but MAN can he pose without it, too. Very solid, make sure you grab the light kit, too.
---
To be fair most DLCs are just reruns of similar mission sets and enemies with new texture at a heafty 30 dollars twice a year.
---
Lol you obviously have no idea what you're talking about. Zavala misses Cayde as much as he misses his dead wife.
---
There are several ‚Äúis recluse good‚Äù posts daily. People are creating posts to get upvotes.  Not even worth answering. 
---
It‚Äôs the same as seeing the ‚Äúis Destiny 2 good‚Äù posts on the Destiny subreddit.
---
Sounds like a plan! I on the other hand am an anxious person, but I do have a desire to do the activities that I want which (most of the time) out-weighs my anxiety.
---
I wouldn't call myself a sherpa by any means, but I have taken groups through raids and have fully explained them. I'm all about chill vibes and that sweet sweet loots.
---
Shaxx is the Chad we should all aspire to be
---
This is the way
---
Not 100 discipline, you are failing.
---
This happened to me yesterday as well. Caused a raid wipe.
---
Dude that's one oversized recluse.
---
Count me in
---
Sooo.... how am I supposed to hold that to shoot?
---
What?
---
We found the missing link, and it is vexing.
---
As much fun as I have on the Titan, I've always come back to my Hunter. The agility, the dodging, making my entire team invisible during flawless runs of.. whatever, I've always loved it. Plus the armour has always looked good imo, I've got more fashion sets for my Hunter than either of my other characters, I change how they look a lot xD
---
Think you mixed up the races.
---
Same üòî
---
i got disconnected too
---
I just got booted from an Iron Banner match and I was doing amazing.  FML...
---
Keep doing LFG till you find people you like. I wandered aimlessly for destiny 1 and the whole first half of destiny 2 until I did a guided game and hit it off with the people one day and was recruited as an admin to a clan before we even finished the first encounter
---
Seems that way.
---
Got booted from menagerie yep
---
This was patched at the end of last season. Unfortunately it no longer works.
---
So I did
---
yeah, a raid group can make do with 1 mute but probably not more than 1
---
Eu servers are fine
---
I mean, you do you, I‚Äôm just here to shitpost and laugh. People are going to talk about what‚Äôs popular, but like I said you screaming at everything and spreading negativity on a post where people are talking about alternatives to OEM and titans talking about how they themselves don‚Äôt like it, well you just are doing any good my guy. Like I said go calm yourself down watch a video or something, but stop coming into random places and complaining, cause guess what, nothing is more unoriginal than complaining about stuff you can just move along from.
---
You know you can look through the collections and see what every shader looks like on your gear, right?
---
Theres a portal there??? Damn I didn't even know
---
One of the current Iron Banner shaders does, Mossbone I think.
---
Im in Eu server I think. currently fixed
---
I thought we were talking about raids in Rust. You can do those when everyone on the server is offline and you can grind gunpowder, avoid people, and hide when everyone is online
---
I have a clan for that lol we're called The Lone Wanderers. Just a bunch of solos lol
---
Quacker-morn
---
[removed]
---
That might be up your alley
---
I remember these times and I miss them dearly why can we have gjhallenhorn(I have no idea if I spelled that right) , vex mythiclast and fatebringer back, I miss them so much
---
This is the way.
---
"Stop coming into random places and complaining" tell that to half of this subreddit man. That's all it is. It's either "lol titans are crying because they're nerfing the mask" or "damn titans and their OeM b.s." it's all just a big ol bandwagon. Nothing is more original than jumping on a bandwagon.
---
Is that a fucking felwinters sniper there that makes this a nightmare down memory lane
---
Day 3765 or is it day -3765? Who knows with time loops.

True but you‚Äôd still have to do some activity in order to get them rather than just dismantling stuff

Don't be so hard on them. They've just forgotten what it was like to be in your place. Sometimes their confidence leads to bad explanations since they understand the mechanics so well, and it can lead to frustration on both sides. It happens.
---
Tried jumping puzzles?
---
Titans that use OEM were bottle-fed and/ or adopted. 
---
The nerf is LONG overdue....can‚Äôt wait for titans to stop snorting crayons long enough  to realize a few of their exotics are OP in the PvP sandbox.
---
I miss my beautiful Hawkeye
---
What about 12345? The infamous luggage code? The impossible to guess password? Hotel?
---
I have two ideas of what the problem could be.
---
* The quest has a step where it asks you to **upgrade** the chalice using the imperials you got from the triumph(s) you earned from your first run through of the menagerie. Have you or have you not done this? 
---
* Are you on the same character? The chalice is account wide, but you have to manually pick it up from one of the Calus robots on your other characters.
---
Are you on Xbox? I guarantee my clan could make accommodations for a muted player in a raid until you‚Äôre comfortable. Raiding is stressful and it‚Äôs super important to us that folks have a good time when they play. It‚Äôs a no pressure environment.
---
Honestly this sounds like a you problem. Has it occured to you that maybe you aren't supposed to save a copy of every item? Even if you want to? 
---
Do you know about the collections tab? Some items can be replicated here once you have discovered them.
---
This resinates to well with me. Even with a coworker who i have no problem talking to face to face I wont say a word too when playing. 
---
Edit: grammar.
---
Yeah. Bungie is really frustrating a (large) portion of their community...they can nerf something into the ground but can fix Day 1 bugs or give us QoL updates.
---
I've played since beta but have never done a raid, it's hard being a lone wolf player sometimes. I really wish they would make an LFR version like WoW has.
---
That's the name of a character from a Russian sitcom rippoff of Married... with children.
---
That‚Äôs never happened to me, but I get killed by warsats all the time cause I‚Äôm not paying attention when the event starts
---
How many times are you going to comment on the same memes? You have the power to keep scrolling yet you lack the will power to overcome your sandy vagine. All up in your feelings.
---
I've been balanced glide. Ik there's supposed to be a difference. But it seems just as fast and as much distance, except with more control. So what is the difference that makes it so good? Also since I'm to tree dawnblade blade should I not switch since burst will get nerfed?
---
U better get bringing, I reset last night and I hated myself knowing I had to endure that all again. But kudos to you brotha
---
Plenty of exotics for titans to use right now. More than warlocks or hunters for sure.
---
*leader does 7,000,001 damage*
---
#i FeEL lIKe I‚ÄôM caRryInG tHe wHolE tEAm
---
It wont let me upgrade my chalice at all. I have the required imperials for it but it wont allow me to do so. I only play on one character, that being said I switched over to pc about two months ago from ps4. Could that be the issue ?
---
That‚Äôs amazing
---
I remember that. You had to do the Weekly Heroic Strike every week, it was like a Nightfall but not as difficult and only really gave you Strange Coins. And if I‚Äôm not mistaken it was only enough to buy either one weapon or two pieces of armor, so if Xur came by with a weapon AND armor you wanted, you better have some spare coins lying around because that weekly strike sure as hell wasn‚Äôt gonna pay for it all.
---
Not anymore its trasho
---
Wow so deep.
---
I think I know your problem. It's that your playing on ps4
---
I don't know if that is the problem or not. I was under the impression that the Chalice no longer requires Forsaken ownership, so if you owned Forsaken on PS4 and do not on PC, it *should* still work. 
---
Is there a different upgrade it wants you to buy instead?
---
If you really wanted it to be a throwback, the Ascendant Shards and Energy should‚Äôve been Rare instead of Legendary
---
Can we get a wholesome Shaxx page?
---
Bungie does not look at this subreddit. Bungie looks at /r/destinythegame.
---
I‚Äôve never had any problems playing on PS4.
---
Bruv I love gambit
---
As another warlock main, let him have that one, that was sick as hell. What was he supposed to do? Challenge chaos reach with a scout rifle as opposed to backing the hell up?
---
This is too accurate
---
Agreed. I bought a high end gaming laptop last year and I sold it and set my desktop back up. Fully regret buying the laptop. Ran so hot, and although its specs were similar to my desktop, it ran so much worse for some reason. 
---
You'll get more bang for your buck with a desktop, and both of the laptops you listed up there just meet the minimim requirements. You really want to exceed it to run well, especially when using a laptop. Hell the Dell listed above doesn't even have the recommended video ram. 8gb ram is recommended and the dell has 4gb video ram. And since it looks to be the same card as the other laptop, it likely has 4 gb video ram too and doesn't meet recommended.
---
That means welcome to stutter town with the card trying to keep up.
---
I have yet to do any
---
because I hadn‚Äôt played in a year and a half

---
I suppose I don't see an adequate reason as to why console players can't use KBM should they choose. There is nothing about the control interface that wouldn't work on consoles. Console players might be more used to controllers or prefer controllers, but I dont see why it's the only input method.
---
I would imagine that the next Gen of consoles support KBM natively. If only for the growing Esports scene.
---
Campaign is fun lore wise, but not really necessary for loot and power leveling.
---
Your little runt is becoming a man
---
It's definitely my least favorite of the flavors.
---
I do miss Hawkmoon. Such a nice handcannon.
---
Yes.
---
edge transit
---
I didn't pick up the game for story either
---
Well if you want to do the vex offensive and season pass stuff you need deluxe but if you want to do the raid and the moon activities you don‚Äôt
---
I love Gambit, I hate Gambit matchmaking
---
What is this a picture of?
---
Enabled for your enemies, not your teammates.
---
Just in time for Christmas too
---
Bungie matchmaking has been broken since Halo 2. Never fixed, never changed.
---
I had to play crucible because of a quest and I‚Äôve never played it since
---
Where are the motes of light. God I just realized how much I miss leveling up weapons
---
I was asking because I had both, and I wasn‚Äôt sure what was and what wasn‚Äôt available to people without Shadowkeep
---
Thanks.  Going to have to buy the deluxe then.
---
PC or console?
---
You can buy just the regular version. Iirc the deluxe just comes with a few in game rewards, which you will already have, and season passes for the rest of the year. The season passes are account based not console based so they will transfer with cross save
---
Iron Banner is nuts. Need to put on my big boy pants before I enter. Would love more casual modes like old Skirmish I always found those were even and balanced, as all things should be.
---
You‚Äôre welcome honey
---
100% same. I'm always scared of the worst case scenario &amp; write it off as "guess I'm not doing ____ (i.e. a Raid)" but I fail to see that it's worth the risk if it could also go fine. I get a success story pertaining to Raids, which makes it less scary, &amp; get the clear for loot and such, maybe even make a friend or two
---
I can't even post on LFG stuff for just the Spire of Stars Entrance on Prestige for the Shader... Such a small task, not a big ask, but I can't post it. I think I'll talk about anxiety medication or therapy &amp; try LFGing if that helps
---
also garden
---
Uphill both ways?
---
I believe the Supremacy has the highest rate of aim assist in the game.
---
If anything the sniper itself is good but I would look for something with snapshot sites or something along those lines.
---
Update on Cayde: *deceased*
---
Make me dinner
---
Stupid. PvE is a snoozefest and Gambit is trash. Just your opinion
---
Hmm.  So I won‚Äôt lose access to the upcoming seasons?
---
Do you have the destiny app?  Just jump on a fire team.  Did my first raid at 850 light (leviathan).
---
Plus since fallen shoot arc it‚Äôs easy chain kills
---
Better than your sniveling ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Honestly people will bitch if I use skullfort, people will bitch if I use peregrine greaves, people will bitch if I use OEM, and people will bitch if I use synthoceps and punch them from 20 feet away. Maybe the problem isn‚Äôt the exotics maybe it‚Äôs the ridiculous number of people who play crucible like their lives depend on it and make forum threads *bitching* every time a Titan kills them with anything.
---
These threads and memes literally aren‚Äôt funny, this sub should just be renamed r/huntercirclejerk
---
Why did someone give you the d
---
No. I bought the deluxe edition on PS4 and the regular on Xbox one and I have all season passes on both.
---
Destiny 2 needs more role play areas where you can sit down or do random shit in areas like the tower, the animations are pretty perfect for that
---
Handcannons are no-scope-better-scout-rifles. That randy‚Äôs grind was so frustrating.
---
Is it though?
---
Guess thats why
---
Yeah I‚Äôm gonna have to call bullshit on fifty kills per game
---
Quackis porn
---
Yeah, you might be right. I did discover some stuff tho, like how when I launch destiny 2 on steam I see the cross save symbol beside my characters, while I don't see it in my ps4. And the account name showing up in my ps4 is my PSN account and not my steams, not sure if that's supposed to happen.
---
Forge 100 frames of any kind at the forges.
---
U must be wearing big boy pants.
---
Should be similar loadout. With "loadout lock"
---
Edit: or maybe not
---
Idk all I know is that I've lost many gunfights because of hunters dodging and suddenly having a huge health advantage over me. It's especially annoying when they're one shot and escape behind cover only to have a lot more health when I push them.
---
 At least with OEM there's an indicator so it's easy to just disengage if you think you're at a disadvantage.
---
Nah prolly smugglers word
---
‚ÄòRecluse‚Äô and ‚ÄòFusion Rifle‚Äô come in a close second.
---
God damn it spoiled now
---
Farm upgrade mats with nightfall?
---
Do exotic quests? 
---
Use bungie lfg to find people?
---
There are different settings for clans. They can either be open, where anyone can click a button on the Bungie website and join, or they may require an invite. 
---
You can find clans using the [LFG megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bzjpkr/official_lfg_megathread_v_4/) ([or the newer version](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/dudpe1/official_lfg_megathread_v5/)) linked at the top of this subreddit.

Problem is a lot of those are exotics, and since recluse isn't but is still comparable to them it effectively invalidates those choices. Of course there are going to be exotics that outclass it (Riskrunner with its perk makes Recluse look like a Nerf gun) but whenever you equip an exotic you're limiting your loadout. The Recluse nerf will give other legendaries a chance, not just exotics.
---
Ok boomer
---
Its The Rebluese
---
U just said melee. I play warlock. They don't melee in super
---
Gambit was fun, when it launched, now its just a chore
---
I say keep the grind. Hell, make it worse. Recluse is easy to get. Randy‚Äôs is arguably even easier depending on how quick you can get to fabled. 
---
I want more guns I can feel proud of. Guns where the whole premise is ‚ÄúHey, feel good about this. Not everyone could do what you‚Äôve done.‚Äù We need more skill/grind rewarding weapons that don‚Äôt feel like a handout.
---
Elsa let her sanity go wiping your raid.
---
Why kill invader before last envoy? I usually try to nuke the envoys so the buff is stacking while we're hunting the invader.
---
Hold grenade, just like arc buddy.
---
PvE is kinda a cakewalk because recluse exists... It's more needing a nerf for PvE than for PvP honestly, it's a very average SMG when it's not powered up and you need to get the kill before it powers up.  Is my kill clip outlaw blast furnace OP because it drops people in one and a half bursts after a kill from a massive distance?  Recluse is very strong when powered up, but so is literally any other weapon with kill clip in PvP when powered up.  It's stronger because of how the perk functions with any kill and it's instant instead of after a reload, but it's not some kind of easy "always win all the time" weapon.
---
In the meantime, recluse makes every single piece of PvE content as trivial as it possibly can by being as strong as most special weapons with near-infinite ammo as long as there's something with a red health bar somewhere within 80 meters.  You find it, you kill it, you rampage through everything else including yellow bars until the buff runs out and you need to find another red bar to kick start it into God mode.  It needs a nerf for PvE more than anything.
---
Recluse is a dying ship... I grinded for 5 days to get the Outlaw Multikill Clip Subjunctive SMG, which is the new Recluse
---
If u have the chalice in your missions tab, inspect it. 
---
Also the sweeper bot in the tower has bounties. Along with the bot on nexus.
---
This man has never fought the invisible reflect arcstaff. I feel sorry for the virgin Wormhusk user.
---
Good to know, next time I‚Äôll try it
---
This is why Toland turned to the Dark Side...
---
Gambit is just PvP Black Armory Forges
---
Yeah sure I can deal with those, but I need to keep the items that can't be reacquired, there's about 160 hunter armor + 163 weapons, that's 323 items I need to keep, that leaves me with 177 slots I can use for Items that are really good or that I just use
---
‚ÄúOk boom‚Äù
---
Stopped reading there sonny, I‚Äôm a 32 year old millennial. 
---
Not everyone who disagrees with your shit opinions is a boomer you fragile little snowflake.
---
Titan main, by the way.
---
Top tree arcstrider: *Am I a joke to you?*
---
Too bad its pretty shit in pvp against other classes that can kill you with 10% of the effort
---
The last thing we need is another ‚Äúinstant super‚Äù meta class. We‚Äôve done that, it was bland, let‚Äôs not.
---
I thoroughly enjoy all gambit modes. During season of the drifter and whilst I was farming Dredgen, I swear I saw my will to live come and go from my body about seventy times. It's all about enjoying the ride and FUCKING CURSING THEM BLUEBERRIES
---
Blast furnace is in my opinion the best pulse.
---
Ammo synthesis saved me multiple times in d1
---
What a tweest!
---
And just because you don‚Äôt like it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs bad. And you‚Äôre oversimplifying with the statement: ‚Äúyou‚Äôre either invading or you‚Äôre* doing everything else.‚Äù You could be taking out a blocker, looking for an invader, or going after enemies for motes. Ive also never had an issue with wall hacks or inzanagis.

Scorch Canon Battles: Biggest Brain
---
Yeah I have the recluse and I can snipe
---
my friend made one too! does yours have an ejectable ammo shell?
---
Thanks a lot this really helps!
---
Oh we will
---
I started making real progress when I would complete the grey frames (augmented) and complete those as I‚Äôm playing. Then just run a few forges. This allows you to get 4+ frames in a single run without wasting too much time
---
If you use the war rig don‚Äôt be afraid to spin that thing up and keep it spinning lol you literally can hold the trigger down for a min without reloading
---
Yes, PvP bad, PvE good.
---
Ok I would think they would look at anything destiny related. I mean if you were part ownership of a company wouldn‚Äôt you look for intel anywhere. I would. But I got your drift. I will post to that location as well since they are not human apparently
---
You don't need to be a sweat to get luna, just put in the time and work. I'm not even that good at crucible and in two days I went from guardian I to mythic III with minimal effort invested.
---
Solo queuing in Gambit can be rough, but I like it nonetheless. Also I fancy those weapon designs, they're simplistic and look great, especially when colored black and silver.
---
That‚Äôs the next round! Right now I‚Äôm making sure this guy handles good quality builds! Those are cool though!
---
Iron Banner armor has good stats, if you are willing to play at a 50+ power disadvantage
---
Thats not oversimplification at all. Youre either invading or doing literally everything else. All at once because its all so easy. And next time try using izanagis when invading. It trivializes the entire "challenge" of invading.
---
You can buy it with silver
---
Nope. Randy‚Äôs, exit strategy, and edgy wise suck to get. You need to do the master nightfall to
---
and how do i get silver?
---
I just checked the psn store through my app and it‚Äôs showing that shadowkeep is 40% off for the standard edition. 25% off for the digital deluxe.
---
I only need exit strategy and the emblem and shaders the rest from the quest are finished
---
All of which are great weapons... Except riskrunner and thunderlord are the only ones here decently comparable, they're exotic, one takes heavy ammo for a similar add clear experience, and neither of them let you use izanagi's.  Also braytech werewolf?  Do you even realize how terrible it is?  It's decent when powered up, but it's one of the slowest weapons to get going with some of the worst DPS numbers in the game.
---
In other words, congratulations, you named some guns and didn't even think about what you were naming.  Recluse is by far the strongest add clear weapon not only because of the strength of the weapon, but in the versatility in loadouts it allows by not forcing you into using it for your exotic slot and chewing into your boss damage options.
---
Most drop randomly. U might kill a random enemy and get one. Some exotics have quests. There is a trader that comes every Friday (his name is Xur) that sells 1 exotic weapon and 1 exotic armor for each class for legendary shards (he changes location each time so check online on Fridays). I believe some are tied to raids but I haven't yet gotten into raids so can't confirm. A way to farm exotic armor is to do higher level Nightfall: The Ordeal but seeing as u r new, probably won't be doable for a while. So gotta hope some random exotic drops as u play or do quests for specific exotics.
---
A relatively easy exotic quest is Pain and Gain (aka Joy of Suffering). Get the quest from Banshee on the tower. It's one of the easiest if not the easiest exotic quest I've done. And the reward is Riskrunner, a very very good exotic SMG
---
HOW IS YOU FEELIN VRO
---
FEELIN LIKE THE 4 I FEEL FANTASTIC
---
To answer no. In order to get silver you have to pay
---
It costs real money
---
Last room of vog is still the coolest looking raid boss room to this day
---
I dont have the psn app, I was trying through in game and the playstation website though and I kept only finding the deluxe... maybe I'll get the psn app
---
That dude's thicc but in the wrong end. Ilya Bryzgalov would probably want to have a word with this dude.
---
I just searched for shadowkeep and it‚Äôs shows both options.
---
Can these weapons be forged from the newly named ‚Äúlegendary weapon frames‚Äù only ?  Or can  the curated rolls still drop after you‚Äôve used 2 legendary frames per character ( I can‚Äôt remember what the name is when the they aren‚Äôt legendary frames ) .
---
I love that one is named *Haakle Feucht*
---
First clear refers to the first of up to 3 weekly clears, not their "first ever"
---
I‚Äôve seen some Huckleberries and Riskrunners, but I wouldn‚Äôt call it a SMG meta
---
Or the nerfs.
---
what is elemental affinity?
---
Have the people in the back pointing in just about every direction except the direction to capture that goddamn zone
---
Nice I can't wait to see the final result.
---
you should try to make like a paper version of the ace of spades
---
What's your advice?
---
What ü§î
---
Nightfall 920
---
They are almost all random drops. There are exotic weapon quests but thats it. Just play and you'll get them.
---
Depends on the subclass of warlock you are.
---
Similar Skill + Varying Light Levels = Roll or Stomped.
---
Do you have Burden? Put that on and any Smg with anti barrier rounds. 
---
Post and lfg on discord or the app, describing what you have.
---
That's it.
---
I think it‚Äôs perfect. I don‚Äôt even mind getting killed with pinnacle weapons as I know they took work to get. Getting killed with rng things - that is annoying asf.
---
1st 2 IB nearly every game was hardcore lopsided,1 team had the skill and the other team looked like fresh players with broken controller buttons,it was zero fun stomping or being stomped,havent played one game this final IB because of the frustrations from bungies broken sbmm. To be clear, i want sbmm, i like true sbmm,but this version sucks...comp exp was the same,totally lopsided mess.
---
Yeah I got 5500 in season 4 but just didn't go for it
---
üò•üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
Just keep in mind that pinnacle activities (like the Leviathan Raid) will still upscale if you try to just shit on it with a 950 team. It'll still be somewhat difficult.
---
JOE MOMMA
---
Because everyone got an ass ton of Dust Rocks a year ago and Erentil is training wheels garbage for people who can't play?  I'd rather you could get Antiope, personally.
---
If you're playing Gambit prime, please stand inside of the final light circle to deal damage.
---
I cannot count the amount of times I run into players that keep shooting it while on the opposite side dealing barely anything.

Warlock stormcaller

I don‚Äôt think this is what Saladin meant when he said shit on your opponents.

SNL reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmqeZl8OI2M
---
Ok. Is it possible with a 2 man fireteam
---
It's old news for the past 8 months
---
Wait, people hate gambit?
---
Nope. Biggest lie ever told in Destiny 2:
---
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre breaking up these teams to find a better match.‚Äù
---
Vanilla Ghost! Vanilla Ghost!
---
You could just get murders by some edgey kid who wants to hang hours sister and his deformed friends
---
I was thinking about the radiant heat mostly. With proper airflow the air should be ok, but being near extremely hot components might still heat it up. I was just being cautious, really. It would be sad if they made this cool thing and it ended up going wrong.
---
No lie, this movie was actually really good. And the music is super catchy
---
You need to purchase a upgrade I had the same problem Buy the only upgrade you can buy and then you will be able to play it
---
Cat gets exercise too lol
---
Ohh, that's really really sad, so it won't be usable after nerf? :/
---
Like the massive robot that is like a hobgoblin?
---
All the bad kids say that
---
Drifter should have it. You know it's not just beating the strike though right? You have to kill the knights that spawn when she's low on health before you end it.
---
you need forsaken exotics and subclasses to play meta weapons and builds. forsaken is must to buy rn. shadowkeep is new and not too much content available.you can buy it later if you are at endgame. new stuff is coming with shadowkeep but you will need new stuff when you are at endgame.
---
[deleted]
---
Same
---
Got it when it came out for Collections reasons, can't even remember the first step lol
---
Still gonna be one of the best guns in the game, just have to aim after the nerf
---
Iron mossbone shader
---
Bounties, though you'll have a rough time trying to get to tier 100 if you're only starting now without buying tiers
---
Yesssssssss
---
Scorch needs to be a permanent mode
---
You on Xbox?
---
Nice
---
Works for me
---
It will stil be very much usable. Now you'll actually have to aim with it.
---
And for some people, aiming is a dealbreaker. Its stil going to stay in my inventory and I'm still going to use it.
---
Really? Oh OK, I have np with aiming. Thankss
---
Insane
---
Thats smg is most powerful energy weap Ive ever had. No exotic gets near. And nerf? :D Now reckluse acts like enemy has weak all over body (while master buff is active) and bungie is going to make it work correctly. Reckluse will just require precise aim now to keep its massive dps, thats all :)
---
Ohh, aiming? Well if it's just that I probably won't have any problems
---
Okay thanks
---
Nice.
---
Found the toxic player
---
Ohh ok thanks a lot. I am a new player you see and I like smgs and auto rifles so this is the weapon I first grinded.
---
Its harder to fail this activity than to beat it...
---
110s are really good if you have a damage boost in PVP, easily 2 tapping anyone with something as small as Rampage x1.   
---
180 HC are much the same way on PC. Basically, they're quite slow, but the upside is that with kill clip you're getting the old Luna's Howl TTK of 0.67. In PvE, Trust can roll Dragonfly + Rampage, which is a nice combination.
---
Worlds best 7/10 baby. I told myself I wouldnt come back until they made a game that didnt double you over yearly for two rehashed DLCs costing 30 each, making actual new content that reminds me more of their glory days, like halo.
---
I want to earn it, because I never kept my pieces and now I regret it
---
Are you selling the .cad file?
---
I thought of originally putting it on Omnigul instead of Phogoth, but settled for Phogoth when I couldn‚Äôt find a good enough angle (or high quality photo) for Omnigul after searching for images
---
Matchmaking prefers:  
---
Matching you with sweaty one-eyed mask titans with grenade launchers and Recluse
---
It definitely stacks damage
---
The point of ordeal is to NOT speedrun. If anything, you taking your time to kill the Champions is the right thing to do. People who speedrun past the Champions are the assholes.
---
It's really not targeting warlocks considering they can do the same to other supers from other classes
---
Nice dude!
---
well tbh
---
do what yo want its you playin^^
---
Then use your vault to free some space in your character
---
Do you even know how to work a phone, why‚Äôd you draw those scribble lines? And that makes NO sense
---
Super is still much better in top tree i never run bottom tree for PvE even if i dont feel like melee that being said you should try just punching everything you dont really need a 1-2 shotty
---
I think it kindda works for me. At least more than the conection one.
---
Looking like she's dealing bright dust outside Gaben's corner store.  This is a strangely robust visual metaphor.
---
Took me a year of practice with other games and staying off controller completely
---
Honestly try to get 1 other person to run with. Communication is huge in comp. Find a good loadout and stick with it. Learn the corners and if you cant find anyone to play with always follow a bluberry around. Having 2 people shooting at the same guy vs 1v1 is better.have to adapt to each scenario
---
Okay. Let's try to fix this.
---
1. Invaders are absurdly bright red. You likely don't see them because of problem 2.
---
2. You can invade using the portal near your bank, it looks like a vex portal. Invaders spawn normally across from the location the enemies are at. For example, in the EDZ map, there's 3 spots: Beach, Forest, and Buildings. If enemies are currently at Beach, then the invader is likely at Forest. If the mobs are at Buildings, it's a toss up between either spots iirc. If mobs are at Forest, they are likely at beach. Take this with a grain of salt, it's been a while since I've played Gambit, but this is how I think.
---
3. I thought the PvP aspect was sweet, it appeals to both kinds of people. PvE kind of person? Go around and kill things. PvP? Invade. It only gets annoying if you don't learn how invading works so you're prepared.
---
Hope this helps you out, Gambit isn't TOO awful. Also grinding out my Exit Strategy fresh, good luck out there Guardian.
---
Yup and don‚Äôt forget 21 delirium but I‚Äôm also using transversive steps with 100 mobility so I like never have to reload and be fast af
---
I‚Äôm a gambit god
---
I thought it was "your enemy can't kill you if they're dead"
---
Legendary
---
Let's try to be civil y'all.
---
Any one of these will solve this: 
---
* Restart the game.
---
* Switch characters
---
* Load into an activity
---
Congrats now multiply that hours spent by 8 and you get not forgotten
---
I only got one as well but remember to equip Drang so I could get Sturm.
---
Five of Swords has no effect in Ordeals, which are currently better than standard nightfalls except for strike exclusive loot, since there are 3 regular nightfalls vs 1 ordeal per week.
---
Don‚Äôt you ruin my fun.
---
That‚Äôs the one
---
There aren't really "builds" in this game. Leviathan is also mostly about teamwork as opposed to pure DPS like later raids. 
---
You should have a special weapon that is good for crowd clearing and a special weapon that is good for boss DPS, and a heavy weapon that is good for boss DPS.

if u like pve u dont play gambit bcuz u are forced to pvp, this is the biggest problem i see in it

is see its as a pvp mode, not pve mode, since the only thing that make u win / lose is pvp in the end anyway
---
I like the way you put it.

I really like my characters to look quite intimidating, I have only found one Legendary helmet I like the look of so far, but it's not an ornament and it is in the low tier for stat rolls, so I never get to use it.

Epic moment when that‚Äôs actually my name... and I‚Äôm running recluse...
---
A destiny raid is the ultimate friendship test.
---
Low key thought it was Onyx for a hot sec and was thoroughly confused
---
It'll either come around or dump weapon parts into Banshee until it pops.
---
Please be kind to each other everyone, regardless of pvp skill &lt;3 
---
We're all still ~~people~~ guardians.
---
It really did solve it! Thank you! I thought i was doing everything wrong :)
---
The only crucible I have fun in is the one where you just run around with rpgs,gambits are fun down right,and patrols are boring
---
Most mods are just random drops from legendary engrams. Legendary engrams from NPCs also count, so try turning in materials/tokens.
---
White streak, speeds by
---
*YETH*
---
Stick with your team, always. Communicate if possible.
---
Play conservative so you dont use up all the respawns.
---
Dont let the other team get the heavy ammo.
---
Try playing at non-peak times.
---
Ever since I started carrying a Bad Omens with tracking module I've enjoyed it much more. Invaders always killed the fun for me. Now I kill them.
---
If you land everything it‚Äôll break it but it won‚Äôt kill the titan inside
---
I loaded up my striker titan with Randy‚Äôs, Recluse, Hammerhead and OEM for one last iron banner lulz. Good times
---
Most of the time you will switch specs/gear/weapons depending on fights and raid comp. This goes for all raids
---
Got fighting lion, the cabal scout rifle and iriannas vow within a day of each other, they are all mediocre
---
Sometimes it's just a timing thing for me. If popping it now means I'll have time to get a second before the end of the match, I'll let one fly on a shotgun rusher or something.
---
velocity and clusterbomb, during arc singe when you need to quickly fuck over everybody over there... RIGHT NOW.
---
I dunno about anyone else that lives in Ohio but we ran these down kids throats I‚Äôm certain grades
---
I know what you mean I really like that Hunter helmet!
---
If you‚Äôre dying to shoulder charge in a smg grenade launcher shotgun meta then dude I have some bad news
---
Playing the meta might help, or playing Hunter with stompees, like the meta
