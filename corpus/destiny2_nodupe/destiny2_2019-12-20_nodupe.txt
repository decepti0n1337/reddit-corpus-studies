So we should just sit and let Bungie fuck us with their exploitative monetization practices? We should let them psychologically exploit the most vulnerable people in their community? Because you find it annoying that people are too critical of a game you like?
---

---
Don't get me wrong, I adore Destiny 1 and 2. They are some of my favorite games ever. But that's exactly why I'm opposed to Eververse in its current state.
---
Very few people are saying to get rid of the cash shop. Far from it: people are generally quite understanding that Bungie needs a consistent revenue stream after having split from Activision. But that doesn't mean we should be complicit in such an obvious scam.

I like the burning knife emote I bought last week. It is still epic. Have a nice day.
---
Done that many, MANY times and it doesn't do anything. My Warlock was fine but my Titan and Hunter have had a nightmare trying to access it.

Ah ok. Thank you very much!

There's a glitch right now that lets you get heavy from special boxes. Only works for linear fusions that I know of though.
---
Okay. So if I wanna play them
---
On my pc I just have to buy them
---
Off steam correct?
---
I bought the shadowkeep bundle on steam already. So like are you talking about the new battle pass thing?
---
Oh I think that was OP .I should have checked the original post I thought by it was something else. I tried Titan today sine it was ok  only two days in so im still in the dance as to what to main.
---
It is content that COMES WITH THE GAME. You should be entitled to acquire anything that is in a video game's files without having to pay extra for it. I don't understand how you can possibly argue otherwise.
---
Imagine ordering a burger, but the waitress takes the pickles off of the sandwich before giving it to you and demands you pay an extra 50 cents for them. Would that not be absurd?
---
Good to know because I thought it just destroyed people.

Honestly depends how good the other team is at invading. The oppositions invader can make or break your game if he's constantly team wiping you. But gambit is heavily PvE focused and you can run Reckoning which is Co-op PvE mode to get Reaper Armor which will make you specialize in the PvE killing element and then your team can't get angry at you for not invading.
---
On console maybe but on PC outside of Gambit it's not really a issue 
---
Snipers shotguns and handcannons are way more used and abused
---
The determining factor is being able to use it when there are no other players near it. Using fast travel/sparrow method instead of the Orbit RNGesus method is just slightly faster.

I'm such a chad that I don't own this weapon.

Well its not like Bungie can do much to combat hackers since they refuse to use dedicated servers for PvP.

Humph, "Juice-box"...

That exposed gpu pcb is very cool

Okay Boomer
---
It‚Äôs just an outlaw rampage hand cannon, do people go nuts over it because it has those as static perks? Just never understood why people worship this gun like it‚Äôs better than Recluse.
---
There are so many clips of the knife turning into a truth rocket after it bounces. Yesterday there was one where it did a 90¬∞ turn and slowly chased someone down the hallway and here it does a full loop to get the guy.
---
I edited my original post with a picture. not sure if its a visual bug or possible location.
---
I have a printout of this in my ID sleeve for school

Better than kiddies who need others to carry them
---
I want my Taken armor set back. I had a Tier 11 on my Hunter and basically never took it off.
---
But - the final, flaming Wolf IB set was also very good - permanent fixture on the Titan.
---
Thx me and my friend who is really into Destiny didn‚Äôt know about this.
---
Oh my god, cheeki breeki comrade. I thought I was one of the only escaper guardian around for a minute there.
---
Any idea what the ration is ? like 7-1 should be an issue right ?
---
Yes there should be a hatch.
---
MC is more revered because of how frequently used it was in Year 1 compared to basically any other primary gun during that time. It‚Äôs basically like the Fatebringer of Destiny 2, sure some guns can compare to it but it‚Äôll always be that consistent Hand Cannon that everyone remembers as being generally awesome. Spare Rations is better than Midnight Coup now, but it‚Äôs not revered as much because Hand cannons don‚Äôt see much play in PVE.
---
EDZ boutta get eaten by the Sundial it seems
---
Bloobs now having mods is the fucking worst thing ever.
---
I wish there was a test you had to do before doing the ordeal where you have to disrupt each one of the champion types successfully and you can't do the ordeal until you do that succesfully
---
Or maybe bungie should make it dual steps for example the 25 kills needed in pvp for the saint quest make it 250 kills in pve if you dont want to play pvp.
---
I personally despise looter shooter pvp modes since they are inherently unbalanced and i had 0 fun during the few matches i needed for those kills since this season flavor of bullshit is apparently arbalest
---
Ah damn
---
Very nice! I got a similar roll with smallbore, accurized rounds, feeding frenzy and kill clip :)
---
Reset the game for the points (known rare bug since day 1. I was there)
---
Keep traveling to the same point because everyone has to have the dial unlocked in that game state to use it.

Maybe players who think that strikes/Altars are relevant. Def not Raid 980 runners I hope.

What got nerfed on hunter that‚Äôs so bad
---
if only that hadnt fucked up the bright dust income with the dumb changes they made
---
I use only sentinel ever
---
That's hella rad.
---
They all have their pros and cons. The only thing I'd change is Weighted Knife granting full ability energy back on precision kills. Maybe change it to increase ability regen for the knife for a few seconds?
---
Then don‚Äôt play it if you don‚Äôt like it. That‚Äôs all
---
No specifications it jusr says "multikills on enemies of the traveler" which is everyone
---
I liked the first tess better then the one we have now.
---
Mine left for dark-ether canes
---
Me too, i enjoy the weapon and armor designs plus Ana Bray is a huge bonus.
---
Do you have izinagi? One of the best weapons in the game., it‚Äôs your range and insane damage.
---
Nah no one
---
Well i finished it and it counted like every 15th multikill... Fun
---
If you load into a different area and drive to it then you can interact with it
---
You playing on pc?
---
Might be worth taking a look at the Ryzen 7 3700X and put the money you save into other parts of your build.
---
I kept shooting rocket launchers and grenades into 5+ groups of enemies and it counted like every 15h multikill. Something is fucky indeed
---
Get this fucking bot out of here. It's already ruining r/sabaton.
---
I just reload until it lets me interact. This is apparently a known issue.
---
It's also important to point out this can't be common, I've never noticed it this strong.
---
It was there last week, so if it's a bug, then it's been a bug since before he was "supposed" to. the TWAB also didn't mention saint not being in the tower as a bug, so it's definitely intentional.
---
I'm a novice in the field of PC Building so I must ask, how the hell is your graphics card connected to your motherboard exactly? And what is that cooling system you have on it?

Yyyyyup. Not that useful for Warlocks or Titans since we have long animations for our abilities and shouldn‚Äôt be using them in a situation where an overshield would help, but for Hunters it‚Äôs exceptionally good as it adds a layer of cushiness to their dodges.

Why are you being racist against whites?

I turned to the darkside for a bit to get the impossible task done

He is very serious. The blatant racism towards white people needs to stop.
---
Why is it a good reason to say it's not okay to be white?
---
I mean they‚Äôre all as good as they were before and it depends on the content you‚Äôre playing. Seeing as this season revolves around solar and void subclasses those will benefit more from the artifact mods, but that‚Äôs all that‚Äôs really changed.

In the case of the sundial blades that‚Äôs excusable because they literally designed it for people to be able to kill themselves in funny ways, but for the other cases that sounds they‚Äôre grinding the activity semi-AFK.

It still seems to work for Dawning Essence.

Gets 2 essence every 2 minutes 20 seconds, about 200 a night

only hold on to 10+ if you know they wont be invading soon. 5 at a time is slow but safe and if you do die you wont lose but 10 vs the 30 you do by dropping 15

By D2 are we talking Destiny 2? Or Diablo 2 lol.  For Destiny, 8GB of ram may be cutting it close, so that could be a problem.  I would also check the frequency of the ram in your BIOS, because with only 8GB (most gaming rigs these days are going for 16) the speed could be what keeps you afloat.  I do recommend you perform that CPU upgrade when you get a chance.

For the insane amount of lore and story destiny has, it conveys it rather poorly quite often. As the other guy mentioned, speaking to Amanda will get you the main quests and taking you through that. If you want to deep dive and learn even more story ‚ÄúMy Name is Byf‚Äù on YouTube is a fantastic source of lore videos.
---
Lol I didn't even catch that.  I think he is referring to the Steam friends? Perhaps there is an overlay for that.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Wow. I started with new light and have heard you guys talking about how good D1 armor is. Always kinda thought you were full of shit and that you were just nostalgia wanking, but nope. This armor set is easily better than anything from D2. They really toned down the style in D2.

---
No worries, usually IB is available for 3 weeks in a season. It will get back, just not right away
---
I‚Äôve gotten exactly what you described. Before they changed it to glimmer it was infact pretty consistent and it did *not* bounce the way it does now. I get that its a rubber tire and all, but damn Bungie. These days you can get it dead center but because it‚Äôs rubber it goes flying into the distance. 
---
There‚Äôs no trajectory we can get that will counter act the tire bouncing, I don‚Äôt see why they had to add a randomized element to it. At this point you gotta just nudge it and hope for the best, when before it was actually fun and took skill instead of luck, cause if it stayed wherever it landed most of the time.
---
Wormgod caress was so fun. When it first went live, every time you punched enemy and killed, it use to make luck in the chamber sound. *Ping*
---
Not one ~~person~~ guardian has ever mentioned this. Bungie did something during that season and the noise stopped working
---
Good news is, since bungie reworked way of sharpshooter, that LITC sound happens. I think Precision multi kills trigger it.
---
What if you wanted power ammo  
---
but a Titan said: **"YEET!"**
---
Yeah social media is full of snowflakes especially companies. I got warned on r/dyinglight for mentioning a glitch. The devs are so insecure about their glitches that they will literally ban anyone even making a reference to one. It‚Äôs disgusting.
---
What about Ana Bray?
---
As cool as this is, there is something unsettling about the idea of cooling a PC with milk...

Warlock is super sick in both PvE and PvP what are you smoking

Should be 750. Check equipped gear. Something didn't get bumped to 750. Gear will drop higher for you till the soft cap at 950. Then prime engrams or powerful rewards will give you +1 on single gear piece. Long climb to 960.

It'd be fine and dandy if it was just there for the people that wanted to play it. But as the title and the beginning of the rant stated, I had to play it for the main story quest. And you're only complaining about me complaining rather than even attempting to giving any sort of advice on ways to deal with my grievances in the future just gives credit to the points I made.

radiolaria is referring to the stuff inside a vex that functions as their brain/brains but not really... you see the white stuff inside the vex constructs ARE the vex so asher was talking about a lake of vex... but as you see the lake is dried up and is now a pit so trillions of vex must've died for that level of dryness to be possible...
---
can someone make a meme about saint-14 and the amount of vex that must've died to allow the lake of vex to dry up?... something like the "FULLY ERECT" meme I saw on r/tf2shitposterclub

---
If it were a simple case of people being better than you, I'm fairly sure you'd have that problem, as someone who never plays Crucible. Obviously you wouldn't be as well practised as people who do play it regularly. I used to hate Crucible too, but I ended up playing a lot of it for the Undying title and I improved a lot. I often do quite well now. It's still pretty much bottom of my list for game modes, but I don't mind it every now and then.
---
I don't really get any of your complaints in your post.
---
So you got killed by supers. You have a super as well. Everyone has a super. Some are more effective than other in crucible, but the same can be said about PvE. You adjust your play style to suit. There's nothing wrong with a bit of variety. 
---
You get killed by heavy weapons. Well get the heavy ammo first then. That's sorta the point. You get a brief advantage if you can secure the heavy ammo.
---
Hand cannons out-damaging everything. No they don't. 
---
Exotics giving you no reason to use them. That's just wrong, there are plenty of exotics that do well in Crucible.
---
Titan sliding with a shotgun. You can slide. You can use a shotgun. You can kill them before they get to you with a more long range weapon.

I'm not trying to be a dick, I'm just saying maybe the problem is that you go into it having already made up your mind that it's shit, so right from the start it's a bad experience.

---
im a hunter main and hhsn isnt that strong tbh. Only for short range. I see a void warlock? Just dodge backwards and his handheld only does 50 damage because of our distance ;)
---
You‚Äôre probably a hunter who sucks with the new knife (even tho it‚Äôs nearly impossible bc that thing is as busted as handhelds) and is taking it out on the subreddit instead of idk. Trying to improve your overall skill so that crutch shit like shoulder charge, handhelds, and shotguns don‚Äôt demolish you
---
I think you are overreacting a bit, hunter throwing knifes have good aim assist and insane range and a extremely short cooldown of nothing if you hit it and at max 30 seconds with dodge. Handheld supernova has very good range, high damage to a large area, and a good minute cooldown. It's a tradeoff. If there is anything about handheld supernova that needs a nerf is its range maybe and definitely controverse hold. Otherwise it's totally fine. Personally think throwing knives could have a bit less forgiving of a hitbox. Lord of wolves on the other hand is the fucking devil and should burn in hell it's like chaperone but it takes no skill and destroys supers.
---
I just realized, with that last headbutt, saint not only killed the Minotaur, but he split the gobin in half aswell. God saint is great
---
you're probably a hunter with no aim on what u call ur 1 shot ability? *THROWING KNIVES*
---
Nah, I'm done being chill. Fuck these whiny ass hunters. They can't play for shit and blame everything but themselves. It's time they take responsibility for being trash players.

I think the only two Tex Mechanica weapons in D2 are the Last Word and the Chaperone, and the only flourish I can think of for TLW is the spin you do when you pull it out. I wish there were more, because they're super cool, and I wanna live my dream of being a real space cowboy.

&gt; After all, looks like they are gradually turning into those lazy fucks, my friend.
---
No, they are not because they do not have a steady income like say the wow devs do. My point was, wow gets shitload of money each month from subs and yet they don't do shit for the game, on the countrary they release even microtransactions. Here on Destiny the majority of the players probably just buys the main xpac with season pass and then doesn't even bother to get anything from eververse. Do you think that with that, they'd have enough resources compared to a game where players have to pay 13$ each month? 
---
In destiny it's the equivalent of having each player buying each month at least 1k silver which is bonkers and would probably be great for Bungie since they'd have an higher income. But it's not like that. Probably less than half or even less than half of the half of the playerbase buys eververse items. So you see, greed is not at play here, it's just a matter of survival, without these things the game would have been already under the bridge.

"you ever headbutt a kell? don't try it. you'll break your neck"
---
made my day ^^
---
Then why send an email code for completing said story?  It makes no sense
---
It really depends on what you are doing.  The activity should dictate your weapons and stat needs.  
---
Basics would be:  
---
You need several pieces for each slot with varying elements and stat distributions.
---
Look for pieces with 60+ base stat points.  
---
Only masterwork pieces that are at least 62-63 or higher.  Level up pieces that are 55 to 60 to about lvl 7 to allow for mods.
---
Look for pieces that complement your usual play style.  If you play more of a support role in a fireteam you may want intellect for a well.  If you use top tree arc in crucible for the melee you want more strength.  If you run the gauntlets that turn your grenade into an arc soul, you want higher discipline.   Some also look for pieces that complement others (helmet with 20 discipline and arms with 20 intellect, etc.)
---
Mobility--increases strafe speed/jump height/general movement (not sprint speed)
---
Resilience-- increases shield/health
---
Recovery-- decreases the time to start healing after damage and the rate that you heal
---
Intellect-- decreases cool down time on your super
---
Discipline-- decreases cool down time on your grenade
---
Strength-- decreases cool down time on your melee
---
Keep in mind that you only get the next lvl perk on these for every 10 points added.  having 59 points in strength is no better than having 50.
---
Once you get a handle on your play style and the weapons you like to run you can really start grinding for armor to complement that.  If you like running top tree arc with double melee and hand cannons for crucible you may want void armor (for hand cannon mods) with high Mobility and Recovery with a good amount of Strength.  But if you are like me and can't figure out the strafe thing on console, you may want Resilience, Recovery and Strength.
---
I feel like Celestial golden gun hunters are used more in endgame then tether hunters from my experience. But yeah i agree that raw damage supers are under-utilized in end game. Im always forced to run luna well when id rather use chaos reach
---
Oh glow up

---
You've inspired me to run sword build previous season.
---
I remember, when i got the Abide The Return last year, felt in love with that sword immediately. But so far, swords are outplayed by many things in this game.
---
Last season i tried to do sword/bow build, really changes gameplay, so thank you very much!
---
Imagine thinking an Xbox is better than a PlayStation..... üòÇ
---
That‚Äôs he only has one eye he ripped out the other one...
---
Play back and use well of radiance. Let your team do everything and just do weak chip damage if you have too. Never let your rift off cool down. Use it whenever you have it. Dont try and help your team win. Just focus on living. Let them do all the work.
---
Did you look for a second page of inventory from Shaxx and Drifter?  If they have to many quests for you they will open a second page, just push the next page button (right on the d-pad on controller) to see if they are there.
---
oooo i just got that today from my 60 something exotic
---
wishender is in a great (bugged) state right now
---
Just found out I have a skull under my hair. Mind blown
---
Ofcourse they're spreading it out. They can make aaaaall the eververse shit but they can't give us more than one quest a week...
---
I don't regret buying the pass but honestly it's so fuckin buggy. Sometimes it feels like this is fallout 76 but prettier.
---
alright, thanks dudeüòÇ i'm still kinda new to the game
---
Yeah you can search for a other hour
---
With this season‚Äôs focus on scouts it‚Äôs a beast, agreed.
---
whereisxur.com
---
who cares
---
niiiiice
---
I appreciate it
---
Not from a Jedi
---
*Angry Primeatball noises*
---
depends on  signal strength.
---
if you are far enough in the season pass you should already have the first so 2 obilisks at the same time.
---
then around rank 11 on an obelisk say tangled shore you can increase it again.
---
Seems like we will be able to have all linked st the same time down the line.
---
Risk runner is your friend. Let a thrall hit you and it's proc. Stand in the circle thing first. The crystal will lose its shield. Shoot it. Do the same with the other circle pad. Risk runner drops adds fast believe me. IV solo'ed it plenty of times. The boss drops pretty dam fast with risk runner proced as well.
---
Seriously. I really want the 2017 Titan ornament set, but it's hard to justify spending $15 for it.
---
What am I looking at?
---
Contraverse holds. Pretty sweet armor there.
---
Excellent Chicago reference.
---
I need 5 wins and then the last step to get malfeasance but gambit is slowly killing me
---
Meatball should‚Äôve been in Fikruls place in Shadowkeep don‚Äôt @ me
---
Don't make them flee dude it already triggers me when enemies moonwalk.
---
@
---
Motherfucker
---
&gt;	Saying that it‚Äôs hard to understand is kinda lame.
---
We have our favorite classes, no need to make this personal.
---
Titan can now easily choose between a jump with during lateral movement versus one with strong verticality.
---
Meanwhile, Warlock has their strafe jump, the speed jump, and the in-between.  But even with the speed jump, I can never seen to consistently get good height.  Oftentimes I'll just stop rising and begin lateral movement again.  Not sure if I need to hold jump or let go of wasd while in the air or something.
---
Can't speak for Hunter, I never play the fucking class.  Not enough hours in the day.
---
Hoo do?
---
*Aggressively dings coins*
---
He comes in about an hour, for the moment we don't know
---
This is surprisingly accurate
---
Bringing my outlaw multikillclip breachlight to my cousins nerf war, wish me luck!
---
Indeed they are. Voidwalker has been my main since d1 and let me tell you that Nova Warp was and still is the most fun I've had on a Warlock. Figuring out how to use Cobtraverse Hold only makes it better imo
---
It's just a fact ur gonna die in sundial. It doesn't feel balanced. 
---
It feels like bungie just dumped enemies in there and beefed em up.
---
Yeah thats why
---
I want one, but its raid-only drop :(
---
Haven‚Äôt heard from GE church in a -
---
*YEEET* 
---
... while
---
I use barricades so much in crucible tho, great for blocking off ways to be shot from when you‚Äôre defending a site.
---
I.. for some reason went from "arc top tree" to hunter, because of the melee focus. Welp.
---
Warlock definitely shouldn't be build for melee in the first place; grenades are much more powerful. :/
---
I want thunderlord so bad. Feels like I‚Äôve been waiting for an eternity üòî
---
How long until Nessus is completely devoured by the Leviathan? I‚Äôd love to see drastic change like that happen in the world of Destiny.
---
Oh yea mb, NOW i see the lake
---
i got 2 sword scavs on my legs :)
---
Hoping to get devils ruin so I can have a finished exotic collection again.
---
Correct
---
it's beautiful
---
Anarchy...I could also use Doom Fangs with better stats I guess
---
Cheeky glowhoo... Was this for hard mode or just normal?
---
It was a pain, so I'm looking forward to the easier completion this season.  That armor also looks great, so I'm excited to see how it does.  Any word on if there will be new weapons?
---
Whattabout r/or?
---
Hello Praxic Fire? Yeah this is the guy
---
I work in end of life care and christmas time is always really busy as most of the folks pass at this time. This week its up 16 people dead. I'm just like can you people stop dying for one day so i can get some destiny time in.
---
Well he‚Äôs only selling seasonal things at the moment...
---
Turns out OP shouldve just bought contraverse instead of using the exotic engram first.
---
Oh thanks, I have 4 Page quest, I Missed.
---
I ask for 3 clears, no more. That‚Äôs all
---
Chances are, Mr. 14 Motes is the one invading.
---
:)
---
Yes I'm aware, I visited xur I'm not blind people. I have multiple things I'm missing and I got a duplicate
---
Yep, scout kills will take the longest, especially without momentum control active.  Make sure you play lots of momentum with a high-impact scout rifle when it shows back up at the rotating playlist.
---
The glory rating is not too difficult, as that climb really only becomes difficult after Mythic rank.
---
This could be r/sbubby material :D
---
where is he?
---
Father?
---
You feed them to your ghost to get funny voice.
---
Yeah, not sure why you'd get a duplicate.  Seems unusual.

That was one of my favorites

Thanks for the spoilers lol.

This was easily my favorite cutscene of all the dlcs

We already have some PvE events with things like that lackluster Vex Invasion event from last season and the mildly interesting sundial event this season.

This is how you meet your soulmate... I guess it was *destiny*
---
How would that have helped? I'm missing multiple exotics between random drop weapons and armor pieces and I got a duplicate?
---
This is what the guardians feel. Revel in this.
---
Wow this is making too much sense
---
You‚Äôre welcome.   I know some people have been waiting to give him his treats so I thought I would let them know.     Lol.

I‚Äôm still confused, so is contraverse hold the only thing you‚Äôre missing or is there more?

Some quest steps,

Robe snags are the worst.

That was the only warlock armor but I still need an arbalest as well and exotic armours for my hunter and titan.
---
Probably a titan main, man. If it's bright and colourful, but doesn't have a zipper, they'll try to eat em like crayons.
---
‚ÄúDo not squeeze, it is not gun‚Äù
---
That's like one or the few things they did better year 1
---
You can pull copies of weapons with static rolls from the collections tab. Alternatively you can trade items between characters via your vault/Destiny Item Manager
---
I think you can't start the quest if you already completed it on your account, but I'm not certain what happens if you start the quest on multiple characters and then finish it.
---
You can pull a second+ copy out of your collections if you want to
---
You have to either put in the vaunt and pick it up on the other character or transfer it across on the destiny app. If you wanted more than one you‚Äôd need to do the quest again I‚Äôd imagine
---
You can pull it from collections on the other characters.
---
any game i play with pvp. I cant fix it.
---
True but even if you only get 16 stacks still a nice damage boost.
---
Hmm bizarre you should‚Äôve gotten arbalest
---
Ahhh ok
---
All is well, until some Awoken (purple) hunter throws a weighted knife at Destiny 2.
---
Thank you!!!
---
I was missing the contraverse holds, I got the engram before buying them directly from xur and got a dupe and I also need arbalest and lord of wolves
---
He has a lot of sad voice lines too about the speaker. ;w;

Damn that sucks but it‚Äôs fair, thanks tho

Ok.  Glad you see your error.  It‚Äôs only free to those that don‚Äôt pay for it.

Having said that. The recluse is just done on your glory rank. Your glory rank is shared across accounts. So maybe you could pick up one on each character.

This is amazing!

I dont know what's with lord if wolves but you should be able to get Arbalest

Ok

I've heard they are jerks over there.

Oh damn I‚Äôm gonna go try that

Maybe it's a side effect of the Sundial? The more we use it, The more of these circles appear in the sky. I really don't know.

The CPU might be a good start but I'd recommend upgrading the RAM eventually. Both of those are going to be your bottlenecks over the GPU, which is pretty good. You'll want to upgrade in multiples of 8 with a clock speed of 2400mhz minimum. If your MoBo supports it make sure it's DDR-4. You might get away with 8 then.
---
**For the CPU upgrade:** You're running an AMD GPU, you might as well pair it with an AMD CPU. They're cheaper than intel and the higher end CPU's are starting to outperform intel. I don't know what your budget is, but you might check out a Ryzen 7 2700. It's $150 right now on New Egg as of me writing this. And it's a damn good CPU for the price. 
---
I've found with games that "boosting" can actually hurt the performance, even with a stock boost because of bottlenecking. You might want to turn that off for now and try this:
---
Check your monitor refresh rate and resolution. Make sure the refresh on the monitor is 60ghz. If it's below that you won't be able to hit 60fps.
---
Go into Destiny and check your video settings. Turn V-Sync on, make sure the resolution of the game matches the resolution your monitor is outputting. Change your FPS goal to 60FPS or 72FPS (All done in the video settings).
---
Also in my personal experience I've found that even lower-to-middle end PC's are still powerful machines, and this game is like 5 years old. Don't walk in thinking you need to hamstring your system. I have a high-end rig and with some games if I set the graphics quality really low it screws performance because my GPU can't even be bother to start working. 
---
If you wanna try those recommendations and see how it runs at high settings first, try it. then turn down the quality as necessary.
---
Cant do that with shoulder charge?? Someones never used skullfort.

Shit, parents come home from a trip tonight so I might not be able to. Thanks for putting it out there man.
---
Lmao I have a console that has a twitch it keeps going on direction and I have to keep tapping it to stop but on tactics I'm not so much of a burden. Normally I play mmo so i get in there to see first hand but if its out for a while then i watch tactics so i dont go in clueless when everyone already know what to do but still you get a better understanding from witnessing it as well. 
---
But mostlikly like op said people want over 9000 clear
---
They are difficult if you look at the actual numbers that achieve them. There is no true measurable difference in how hard it is to achieve legend because PvP is much more then about your own "skill"
---
Raids have specific mechanics and the enemies are dumb, for the most part so if something happens, you/your team is at fault.
---
PvP is much more then that. Every game is different and every guardian, both for your team and your enemy play different. They don't need to play a certain way like in a raid.
---
You can't possible say that legend in the 24 hours is more difficult then one week later because PvP player will always play PvP, regardless of the week
---
Sword, bring a Hive!
---
Ok so no spooky new aliens?

When you have a fully upgraded and linked obelisk it shoots a beam up into the sky.

same. I don't even play gambit that much, and I lost my counts on how many times we were 2 motes short and a guy with 10-15 motes wouldn't bank, just run around killing dregs

the perk is super relevant, you just have to know the synergy. fire a shot and get literally any kill? you're reloaded. it can be a power weapon kill, an ability kill, especially nasty with a sniper or kinetic grenade launcher 'cuz you can just go back and forth with it. That being said, doing the manual reload trick with GL loaders and by the time you remote detonate you usually already have another ready to go.

Everything except the finisher will be available for bright dust. The armor will only be sold as the set though.

New Light would have no bearing on skill based match making.  New light has been out for months now, so a New Light player could easily have played enough PvP and be skilled enough to be matched up with other players.

Tbf, If I‚Äôm raiding with my clan they always expect me to be using the last word because it‚Äôs such a satisfying gun to use. And pinnacle activities aren‚Äôt really that hard with a fairly organized team. Also I‚Äôm kind of a troll. But if I‚Äôm in an lfg group I can totally agree with you.

Here‚Äôs another thread with some answers.
---
Long story short: better aiming which leads to faster and smoother gameplay, faster load times (unless you‚Äôre on a potato), better field of view, better potential FPS, crucible is completely different and things that don‚Äôt work very well on console can work better on pc, and a slightly smaller (but still large) player base.

I have the same model from Palladium, even gray, just not the destiny version and I have to say those are the most comfortable winter shoes I've ever had. Especially with this 8-9¬∞C winter in central europe.

My preferences, in order of importance:
---
Feeding Frenzy
---
Kill Clip or Rampage
---
Stability masterwork 
---
Accurized Rounds or Flared Magwell or Tactical Mag
---
Sight is up to you... I like the close range ones
---
Scout rifle and skill dont go together
---
Nobody actually has to aim in this game.
---
Played destiny 1 on console and destiny 2 on pc.
---
Have to say that console was a bit more chilled but on pc, especially if you play some crucible you have very strong opponents because of the faster movement. Sure, you yourself are also morr mobile but it takes some time to get used to it!

Nope, it is all RNG.  Based on what I have seen and my knowledge of probabilities, it appears to be a world RNG, not a personal RNG.  So it just appears that you have had crap luck right now.  Just keep playing you will get that day where you get 4-5 in a row.

Ofc it had to be the meatball, ffs.

You need to just play lots and lots.  Run around on Earth for a while doing patrols, bounties, and heroic public events.  Or Farm 920 and higher Nightfall: The Ordeals.  You have to pick the engram up from the ground for it to count.  If it goes to your post office it will not count, so make sure you keep your inventory cleaned out so you can pick it up.

2. the purple ball from D1 got crushed in the attack.
---
And that is why titans are cancer
---
Just seems like you ranting m8
---
Really it would prolly be Saint but I can‚Äôt renounce my loyalty to Shaxx since he banged Mara.
---
It's in the lore. Time is only messed up and such on Mercury, so we can't go back and save him.
---
It‚Äôs only mercury that was effected
---
Titans are like onions
---
There have been a few sigils of House of Judgement within the files.. Which I find is odd. Who knows, maybe we'll see the friendly fallen sometime in the future.
---
Role reversal
---
Any chance you could show us more than the first 2% of the canon? You probably get off teasing people, you monster.
---
Was probably supposed to be there on Tuesday but it was bugged since his shotgun was just floating there and they got it up and running by today.
---
I lol'd at Mindbenders God roll
---
It‚Äôs basically the idea that players have a couple months to get it done and the hardcore players will have it done within a week. The good news is that this seasons catalyst isn‚Äôt terribly impressive.
---
Thats great haha
---
And possibly an updated challenge of Elders?
---
Beautiful!
---
Since when can you meet him in the tower?
---
Nah. That was in the past, I don't want another Prison/Challenge of Elders tbh.
---
He has a dialogue about that we are not ready to handle a bird yet. That we have to be more gentle. I thought it was funny. He sounds like the guy from Iron Man 2.
---
I got lucky and a few weeks ago there was a crucible mode called momentum control. That's how I got 250 of my kills. I assume momentum modes come around once or twice a season. It might be worth waiting for one of you're bad at sniping in pvp like me.

---
Body shots were kill shots. So no skill needed.
---
Struggling with my last 30 kills now..
---
If you use Cerberus your spray just means you hit more targets even more times =D
---
Today, just load into the tower and head over to Amanda
---
I've forgotten what my guardian sounds like. This is our journey after all, why cant we speak up about it?
---
Nope. You'd need to givehim your account.
---
Don't do that.
---
"And the helmet stayed on."
---
You forgot to put " 9 times out 10 is a titan "
---
Still an awesome post!
---
The premium track/season transfers
---
And they wonder why PvP in this game is less preferable than cancer.
---
Once you unlink I think there‚Äôs a 90 day wait to re-link (for cross platform)
---
If you aren‚Äôt cross platform then there is no ‚ÄúTransfer‚Äù
---
They sell whole steam accounts I guess
