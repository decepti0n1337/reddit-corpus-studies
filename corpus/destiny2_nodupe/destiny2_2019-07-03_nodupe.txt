Locking thread since there's nothing more to say.
---
The short answer: No, every copy of Forsaken comes with the year 1 content free. There are two ways to buy Forsaken, the legendary collection (just forsaken) and the complete collection (forsaken + annual pass).

The fuck is going on in Alabama
---
It’s a stretch but I guess
---
Take truth off, apparently that can bug it?
---
You must kill an invader within 10 seconds of the invasion.
---
And the dreadnaught in Saturn’s ring is awesome to.
---
It's coming... Apparently Calus has it...
---
The chest is just somewhere in the plains it’s a scavenger hunt that changes every hour so you have to look everywhere there for it
---
Hope they figure out how to make bullets travel in a vacuum. Unless I'm just ignorant.
---
I run the same thing..... And yup that sounds about right... Sorry bud...
---
I'm there too and I can't find it either
---
As the killer or the killed?
---
Unfortunately I didn’t throw enough grenades
---
CPU then is probably the culprit?
---
I just deal with it honestly.... But yeah. Time for upgrades lol
---
It was good in Year 1, and is still a great PVE exotic. Before Forsaken, it was a great PVP because of its ease of use and great perks. It suffers now because it hasn't been tuned properly.
---
I just can't agree with you when there are people with 100+ clears who don't have the raid exotic.  13 was alright and I'm not here to complain about having to run it 13 times.  I'm saying there needs to be a safety net for edge cases, such as the 100+ club.  I don't think you can quite empathize with others enough to grasp what 100+ clears with no raid exotic would feel like.  Whether it's a top tier meta weapon or not, they're exotics that people desire, and pure RNG is not the way to reward it.
---
&gt; Gives you a goal, 
---
It's not a healthy goal.  Is your goal to roll a 100 sided dice and get it to land on 1-5?  That seems like it would be frustrating.  Why should your GOAL be to get lucky?  D2 has many other goals to pursue and some of us have limited gaming time.
---
&gt;and hits the same button a lootbox does without the money. 
---
Time = money.  Would you rather pay $1 to open a loot box (most games) or 1 hour?  My time is worth more than $1/hr.  Your entire opinion is based on the assumption that everyone has as much time to devote to the game as you do.  Sorry, the feeling of wasting an hour of my time watching LFG players make the dumb mistakes over and over isn't a feeling I play videogames to experience.
---
&gt; The good loot is on a pedestal. 
---
Are you talking about raid exotics?  They're literally locked behind RNG.  No pedestal.  Mountaintop, Recluse, you can say those are on a pedestal.  I thoroughly enjoyed those grinds and I thoroughly enjoyed having a meter I could see fill from 0-100% with tangible progress.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Game mechanics that manipulate the player on an emotion level may be your cup of tea, but I guarantee you the majority of the community doesn't want there to be a 100+ clears with no raid exotic club.  Maybe if you could see from a perspective other than your own you'd understand.
---
Hey that's pretty neat
---
Delete this. Your time isn’t valuable so you can waste 10 minutes if need be. Tired of people bashing youtubers for going to the 10 minute mark. That’s there way of income.
---
Best part is Cozmo and DMG found this during playtest lmao. Honestly it probably wont be much of an issue as it takes some setting up to do.
---
That’s the reason whenever I do Garden World, I watch where Dendron’s parts go flying in order to not get splattered like that
---
Like what
---
That was me when i won a dice roll to fill the 6th slot in a clan raid. Dude was explaining a bunch of stuff about plates and spaceships and shit. I was just like "imma hang out over here and murder stuff and step on this circle when you tell me to, cool? Cool."
---
You can masterwork it and add a mod
---
And nobody knows who pulled the trigger. (That’s a lie. It was Petra/Bungie.)
---
Austringer is the correct spelling
---
If there's one thing I've learned in comp, it's that if I end up being 1st or 2nd on my team (that's excluding me sucking even more than usual), winning is pretty much out of the window.
---
It makes so much sense to me that Rose is just a regular hand cannon turned a weapon of sorrow. Makes Dredgen Yor look more like a regular Guardian somehow, no excalibur-esque weapon at hand pre-drifting.
---
I only got thorn today:/
---
I can’t tell if this is a joke, or if you really think that. It’s probably a joke.
---
Better late than never!
---
🤔
---
Sounds good homie
---
How though?
---
Can we please get that cloak
---
Lmao like rose is the better weapon? You're tipping mate
---
Yeah I like this game too, but if you haven't played red dead redemption 2 , I highly suggest it. That game world is absolutely gorgeous, from the mountains to the desert and to the swamps, it's really a work of art
---
I like playing solo, but I like that they make you team up. Sometimes it’s annoying, but it makes you experience what you otherwise wouldn’t have. For better or worse that is.
---
damn, well thank you
---
Kills give you an orb like thorn but the orb is shot at teammates when you hip fire and buffs both of you
---
the only reason i started playing this game was because of how sexy some of the guns look, glad we are getting more of those all the time
---
Secondary’s will give you super at a faster rate because of the higher dps but the drop off will be losing ammo faster. Pretty sure they are exactly the same just depends on how efficient you are getting the kills and managing ammo.
---
I wish things could be that easy, but the meta is far too tight to enjoy on a casual level. I want to play with huckleberry, but when everyone else is holding recluse, I just won't be able to perform in a fun fashion without being chewed up by people holding recluse and OEM. There is no flexibility. No varient playability. It's suffocating, honestly.
---
Ophidians for me are somewhere between the generic group and the good PvP exotics. They lose to transversive steps imo, since TS gives increased mobility/movement speed (especially with traction) while providing autoloading while sprinting. OA gives the melee range but I find that negligible most of the time depending on the subclass I play, and rarely need to reload mid combat. And I’ve used OA extensively, I’ve just found TS to be more consistent for me.
---
my phone has been blowing up all day with these guides
---
Ok, I’ll try that strat
---
"I BET THEY WEREN'T EXPECTING THAT!"
---
Anything with the Hive is better.
---
Wish it was a more viable weapon for both pve and pvp then it would be my main weapon but then again it's a 150rpm and I'm on console so.....pretty cool picture!
---
You have to have a hand Canon equipped!!!!!!!!!!
---
I've read two different things about it. You either have to get the very first kill, before a single guardian is killed in the entire match, or it's tied to the not on my watch medal. That medal is you have to get the kill in the first 5 or 10 seconds that an invader shows up.
---
And I did i had malfeasance equipped and got the kill with it and it didnt count
---
Hmm, Games Haunted I guess.
---
I'm hoping that's not the case but if it is then I'll just have to deal with it
---
Games haunted
---
you can only get the ikelos weapons from killing the level 7 boss, it’ll drop from his body not the chest
---
Chhhk Chhhk
---
Wait you can sword block them?
---
And barely had a grind or am I forgetting something
---
Go to green room in whisper. Kill thral through the crack. Took me 7 minutes :)
---
Seeing Jotun there makes me want that to be a thing
---
Eh, they are mediocre in regards to every other exotic tho, they need buffs
---
Oh ho,  you dare approach me!?
---
Green Room, Titan, Bubble, Crest of Alpha, Recluse=Only took 7 minutes.
---
AND YOU CHOSE THE TOASTER
---
I banish you to the shadow dimension buckaroo
---
Never seen this meme format before and I'll be okay if I never do again because this is perfect

---
Noble Rounds - Kills with this weapon leave behind Remnants. Absorbing a Remnant converts your next hipfired shot into an ally-seeking Noble Round and partially refills the magazine.
---
Blessing of The Sky - Using a Noble Round on an ally heals them and grants both you and them a weapon damage bonus for a short duration
---
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------basically a version of thorn where you decide when you get the buff and it heals team mates. From a bit of testing it increases the dmg by 30-33% so that means you can two tap with some hand cannons in crucible after they have been buffed
---
Umm what was that
---
Hansel, get the flamenwhapher
---
Collections
---
I love handcannons, but a little more variety would be nice
---
And everyone will be upset when Hawkmoon comes out.. the one hand cannon I want ;-;
---
so true, ty.

Of course!

Dude I’ve been wanting a recurve exotic. I’m not much a fan of compounds, but Le Monarque is a beast in pvp.
---
Either build a time machine and go back and earn it in year 1 or complete a triumph for Shaxx to earn it. 
---
I think the triumph is a certain number of crucible milestones completed.
---
What
---
Now that’s a lot of damage
---
I actually have gone up 300 points because of my random teammates being godlike for some reason. Funny how when I actually want to drop rank it's hard to do

---
Time demands over time. Had little time w bursts here and there. As more time passed i had less to use in game
---
That would be nice, but the intake voice chat audio quality is terrible.
---
If comp was mic exclusive, wouldn’t that mean that people without mods couldn’t obtain the crucible pinnacle weapons?
---
It doesn’t do the thing. *Except it does.*
---
Haha! You say that like we arent going to encounter a nightmare of him in Shadowkeep. 
---
Seriously, bungie. Dont do that to us.
---
Medic with the Blutsauger be like...
---
Oh wait, wrong sub
---
Break down the weapon that has them and you’ll get the shader
---
Definitely not. You just need to get the medal
---
I'm not saying it has to be required to pay comp. I'm just suggesting that if you have a mic and playing comp use it.
---
I think they are gonna focus on destiny hard, I know they wanted to make destiny 1 a mmo, but activision wanted a release a year, so they had to shelf it. So I think they'll be ok. Focus on destiny2 while slowly working on another ip using that steam money
---
Let me tell you about the Truth.... 21% Delirium is useful.
---
When you mentioned the 20 thrall thing I immediately thought of the bridge where you could see them from far away in the Alakhul strike. The. I read the next sentence and knew that you understood how awesome this weapon was
---
Most dps is done with legendary weapons, and you even retain the buff after swapping weapons.   It also stacks with well from what I’ve noticed.
---
Hi. So, FINAL ANALYSIS is that I was an idiot. Finished Forsaken on one character, but not the other. Basically I grinded out all of this gear and weapons on a character that would have never been able to play anyway because I didn’t complete the most basic requirement. 
---
Also, just learned that the Menagerie is account based, so I don’t have to rerun the whole thing on my other char..
---
Thanks for taking the time to help out!
---
A reaload trigger such as Huckleberry's perk is still a reload. Also, apparently, throwing grenades while holding the relic in The Corrupted also counts the kills?? I was using Arcbolts on my Hunter while holding the relic and completed that step without letting go of the relic
---
oh neat. so a 150 lightweight with outlaw, not bad on its own
---
Buwhaha, I was leading up to it but the dude stopped replying. I think they knew. 🤣🤣
---
hey guys... the moon is haunted :)
---
Lol
---
That coward. Just couldn't hack it. Hahaha
---
yeah its fucking annoying like damn all we really need is just one video lol
---
Lol damn I can barely hold 10 cores. I just maxed out my weapons and have yet to do my gear. I was holding out in running the last two raids to see if I get anything
---
“The line between Evil Activision and Evil Bungie is so very thin. Do you know which side you’re on Community?” -Activision 2019
---
Last wish raid is easily one of the best raids and i don't know how i am still missing arms and legs for my hunter. The armor looks good, but so does Crown of sorrow armor.
---
Even if you don't play raids, you could always grab a non powerful chest for using a code to warp to the second encounter and do a little backtrackibg on rocks... Which was what i did before i started playing the raid. Unfortunately you can only get one piece per week (per character).
---
What the fuck did you just make me read
---
Only a true hunter lives by their hand cannons 😉
---
That doesn’t mean it can’t fit with titans though.
---
Heck, Shaxx can literally recite the Tempest by heart!
---
i appreciate it bungie
---
Werdly enough sunshot is the only energy exotic handcannon and it's hella underwhelming due to mag size.
---
I get why they have to make the videos over 10 minutes long - at the end of the day, these guys make a living from YouTube videos and streaming, so they have to make sure they hit the time stamps to ensure they get ad revenue. It's just the way of the world, and some of their videos even get the actual content out of the way in a few minutes and then tell you it's just filler gameplay until the end.
---
Exactly like Ana actually, healing allies and hurting adds, but also the damage buff ie nano boost
---
Shaxx "**THIS IS AMAZING**"
---
The dudes video better get the most fucking views. Legit tired of these 10 minute videos of filler garbage.
---
Yes! WTF is going on?
---
If Cerberus is trash explain my 43 kill QP game with only Cerberus and a Pulse on Burnout

Oof thats my dream. Apex Legends has an FOV slider onconsole too but it can make the game lag if you try to increase FOV a lot.
---
Nice
---

---
Can't check now, but was wondering if Crimson would work i.e reload via head shots, not actually reloading the gun
---
You wouldn't get ban from getting kicked out of 1 match. You obviously have a history so the ban is likely justified.
---
"You're a horrible person... but! You make me laugh!"
---
Chambered Compensator, Accurized Rounds, Outlaw and Pomymer Grip. Also comes with a Range MW.
---
It's funny how people just start realising.
---
Sturm Drang is known to do insane damage, and to one-tap with any damage buff (except for OEM). It has been a thing for ages and imo there's no need to fix it.
---
Sturm Drang Inertia, Sturm Drang Rift, S+D+Frontal Assault all can one-tap. (204 dmg)
---
The downside is that you have to use Drang, which used to be kinda bad because the curated is pretty inconsistent for MKB (dunno about controller). but with the introduction of Drang (Barbeque), you can make it pretty consistent.
---
I'll probably get this dlc just because of the hype lol good game bungie
---
nice
---
Also, how long does your ego need to do this? Obviously neither of us is about to say "gee you're right" so if it's just getting the last word in then go ahead?
---
I mean end of the day, neither of our opinions mean anything. You arent gunna change shit in the game and Im fine with how it is. Bungie aint reading this.
---
Congrats
---
I’d love to help! I’m not the greatest but I do have a good game sense and I’d love to give It a shot if it involves anyone else getting fabled! If you play pc hit me up on discord anytime! @Nyx#6336

Lmao I feel you dude

Energy weapon. Not bullets.
---
If you think this has anything to do with karma, you're beyond deluded in your private utopia of no-life PvE sweat land.  This is about improving the experience of the game for many players, it's not about your worthless paragraphs of arrogance.  I type unfiltered and even get banned for calling people out when they're selfish arrogant assholes.  Reddit karma means nothing to me, justice is all I care about.  
---
Clearly you misinterpreted my explanation of why most raiders don't enjoy raids past 20+ times.  What wears me out are LFG raids often taking 1-3+ hours when other people can't comprehend the mechanics or don't know how to stay alive and alert.  Sure there are the occasional 20 min CoS runs, but I can only control one person.  You don't sherpa people for the bulk of your rolls at the exotic, you run with the same clan week to week and might as well be a dance team with matching raid jackets.  Some of us have one weekend night to raid, fire up the LFG app, and often have to run with first time or inexperienced raiders.  Last weekend I endured a 1 hour riven heart run with 3 randoms trying to get a couple friends their 1KV (neither got it), and it reminded me of why I stopped running it after getting my 1KV.  
---
The solution to this problem is simple and the majority of people are in favor of it.  Deal with it.  On one hand we have implementing a simple solution and making many players happy, and on the other hand we have "get patient, or play call of duty".  I already got good.  The helmet stayed on.
---
I’m determined to find a good looking warlock fashion even if it kills me
---
The main thing is that usually its something that can be explained in a short amount of time, but they deliberately drag the videos out just to make more money. I get that they need to make money some how, but its seen as poor effort by dragging videos out for that purpose alone.
---
Use r/fireteams
---
Warlocks: I'll place a rift so I am protected while shooting at the enemy

Hunters: I'll snipe them with my golden gun before they even see me, so they won't have time to attack me

Titans: *activate thundercrahs* YEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
---
*dies*
---
Thanks for the clarification
---
More like mdma
---
Such poetry should be in the Vanguard Lore book
---
I am right, you didn't even attempt to address the facts I laid out above so that's a W in my favor.  I corrected many of your errors and that's the best you've got.  Leviathan raid was 0% RNG and then Activision took over and it went back to pure RNG.  Come on man, that was a grand slam.
---
Hi 'right', im DAD.
---
The magazine is just a magnet. When you insert it into the stock it generates energy wich translates to a few arc charges that you can fire out
---
well it's time to become a guardian
---
good thing I dont need to die as I'm already dead inside
---
Finger gun them to death
---
Thanks for your help, I got the Jotunn at the same time which I still can’t believe so I can’t wait to test both out
---
Congrats i wish i could get anything other than 3 teammates who dont know how to play and leave the game
---
But I mean hey if any on ps4 wanna carry I ackhem mean help me get it
---
The true MVP of destiny content
---
Just dont use the toaster in pvp please 😅
---
I feel that. I got lucky and got matched with 3 random and we ended up teaming up. Ended up getting my recluse and mountaintop that day.
---
I mean, all raid lairs have a starting encounter (kill adds) some sort of jump and run (at least I think so), then a boss-unlock encounter and the final boss encounter
---
Haha I’m so sick and tired of being toasted by the bloody thing
---
No last word no upvote
---
I get matched against 4 stack one eyed masks in solo queue
---
that's just peregrine greaaaaaaaaves
---
Too bad titans are not good for raiding/endgame over. They need a buff/change that helps them for pve. Pretty much bring nothing to the table.
---
Now that is rather unfortunate. Are you using erentil at all? Or wizened rebuke? I used wizened and absolutely shut down titans. Grant it I was also a Titan but I was still about to delete them with their mask with the fusions.
---
Papafaz ure a nice guy man, this question has been answered so many times the past month. I salute u bud
---
What is this chest for?
---
I dont have it yet. Why is it so good?
---
Standard Bungie! Like how the needler fires  needles out of your head instead of the gun
---
Feel for you. I really don’t know why Bungie doesn’t go with a matchmaking system that matches parties against each other. Would make crucible in general a much more enjoyable experience, especially for solo players.
---
My personal head canon is any weapon that is set up in a similar manner uses a transmat system, at the spot where the bullets leave the mag, to move the ammunition into the chamber.
---
Bungie don't read this sub
---
I do not care
---
It does suck. I dropped from 1900 to 1300. So tilted.
---
&gt;like kills with the smg refreshes your melee ability
---
That is already a thing in d1 and is coming to destiny 2 soon.
---
Hunter. No contest.
---
Honestly I'd choose hunter as youre more relevant in pve than a titan(tether, celestial, blade barrage and honestly arcstaff isnt bad for ad clear vs melting point and bannershield and thats pretty much all youre good for and even bannershield is extremely situational cause warlock well is just simply better. As for pvp hands down hunter is still better. Titans are dumb yes(oem, shoulder charge) but how i see it is.
---
god tier hunter &gt; god tier titan
---
okayish hunter &lt; trash titan.
---
Yep. Says that clearly on the quest.
---
Warlock main here but if I had to choose I would go hunter.
---
Ether doctor, breakneck, duke, austringer
---
Enjoy it. Its an amazingly fun and strong gun. Bungie did good on this pinnacle weapon.
---
Sweaty meatballs rubbing across his face.
---
One thing that helped me was NOT running a gl in my primary slot. Sometimes I would get regular kills instead of just dying when I missed my militia’s birthrite shot. It kept me engaged and pushing towards the enemies spawn so I would find multiple people grouped together.
---
is there a difference?
---
Maybee we can find People here? im at 60 in double and 60 in medals. The grind is hugh
---
If you havent got tired of 180 archetypes like trust, Luna or service revolver, try an austringer with high stability (in the 70-80 range) and watch how you can almost feel like you’re on pc. It’s so satisfying
---
&gt; Titans: activate thundercrahs YEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
---
The day Yeet replaced Leeeeroy Jeeenkiiins, was a sad day indeed.
---
That's not even how the joke goes you fake ass dad
---
If you are on ps4 there are massive communities or on pc you could try discord, idk about xbox
---
I’d like to so an “easily” killed storms caller without another super taking it out
---
Oh I agree. 100%. But I like that they kinda force ya to do it. 
---
I’ve probably played 80% of my Destiny career(haha) solo. But I don’t mind too much when it makes me find folks to team up. Until those folks end up being bossy turds that expect you to know exactly what you are supposed to do when they knowingly go into a raid with a first timer. Haha.
---
Dozing City
---
This makes me feel so stupid. Like it makes so much sense.
---
"Biotic Grenades" , Warlock: Attunement of Grace
---
Well there was a bundle for them but as of me looking now they've replaced it with the "Destiny 2 forsaken complete collection" so you'll have to find a site with a code and buy it there or just buy the bundle of the collection or wait until it's just forsaken+annual pass again.
---
Someones shit with 180 scouts ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
What happened to my main man Sunshot?
---
No, that does not fit in destiny. You cant make someone like darth Vader the joker.
---
It's 1 kill, calm down.
---
I think you're talking about esoterickk or however the fuck you spell his name. Used his guide for chronicler and got 3 of the books done in 2 days.
---
Yeah, it sucked. Played 1 game, got my kill, left Gambit for life again.
---
Then reloaded to shoot some more...pew pew
---
What you get for using Jotunn. I hate you just because I don't have one yet.
---
The only true answer.
---
Have someone watching his body for the ghost...then take it out!!!
---
You are paying for forsaken.. the other dlc is free with it.
---
F
---
No.
---
What about mida multi tool’s mag that’s a hard one to make sense of.

Nah. I'm shit with everything.

For when you dont have the will power to pull the trigger.
---
Who don’t believe in Guardians
---
Emergy weapons do not run on batteries. They use bullets that are converted into energy or some shut like that. Casings still come out when you pull the trigger. So yeah this makes no sense what so ever.
---
I made it to fabled last year and twice I had similar drop offs from 1900+ to 1500 by going on losing streaks. I have three tips for anyone in that position 
---
When you lose two games, even close ones, bail out and do something else for an hour. It cleared my brain each time. It’s like gambling, you are betting your glory points on winning the next match and when you lose again you try to double down and lose more. 
---
Loadouts, use whatever kills people quickest for you, I ran erentil and suros, it means I can either one shot or spray people down, even playing average I can be competitive 
---
Don’t go on lfg. If you’re single queuing, and see another single player who is doing well and may even be on the other team, but you might match styles with, send them a message and ask if they want to team up for a while, the difference between pairs and singles is enormous, and 4 stacks attract singles and doubles with high Elo in matchmaking, so it can be easier being in two pairs on the same team v 4. Or you might get a god single added. The lfg are usually organised by people who are looking for a bit of carry and you can’t do that, or suddenly gel with 3 strangers with different styles.
---
Yeah I saw a bunch of new exotic quests come out, are those time exclusive or permanent?
---
Thought your user flair was “I’m like nine. I don’t understand shit”
---
Menagerie is also good, even if theres only three others using it, it counts for 32%
---
Congrats dude! I was going for it last night and needed one more win but then my entire team left.
---
Those will all come up later, for now just work on the campaigns. Follow the list of suggested objectives on the left side of the director. This list expands if you press and hold the button shown in the top left corner. Note that any pvp in this game is strictly optional. 
---
Nightfalls become available shortly after completing the base game campaign. They are more of an end game activity. 
---
Xur becomes available as soon as you complete the red war campaign as well, but there is no in-game way to tell where he is aside from looking on every vanilla planet in the locations he spawns. You can use a website called [Where the Fuck is Xur](https://wherethefuckisxur.com/) to find him. He appears on Fridays and disappears on Tuesdays.
---
It peaked at NASA announcing new plans to land on the moon again.

Now explain your position

Recluse - counterbalance if on console, or backup mag

If any of you would like to add me on discord to run comp I’d love to tag along I’m usually on every day for countless hours so hit me up anytime!!! @Nyx#6336 (blizzard account is coeus#11801)

Any tips???

Now I want a Nighthawk-y Sentinel exotic for the shield throw

They told you the moon was haunted.

you fixed that right up! i love it!
---
I need my god roll beloved
---
Keep a positive mindset!!! The game isn’t
---
Over until shaxx says so, don’t give up because when you think you’re gonna lose that’s when ya really lose, getting to fabled is not an easy task, but with some friends some all nighters and a few gallons of Dr Pepper, I can guarantee a lot of laughs and a great time, I wish the best of luck on your adventure!

I miss DinkleBot

Does this mean that the plane that bombs the tank right after this scene represents the Cabal drop pod that lands on your head?
---
What rolls do you have on the kindled?
---
What guns are you running ?
---
More "what's going on guys" 10 min news videos that should have lasted 2 minutes?
---
Definitely this, we can't get enough of those.
---
It'll create motes of dark 😯

Who hurt you?

Last word, Beloved and Hammerhead

they all milk out the time on the video to at least 10 mins to get ad revenue, youtube’s dumb algorithm

Braytech Sn0helm

Its one of the best weapons in PvE and PvP and it has helped me get to 4900 points this season
---
Any tips/weapons to use to get this done easily. I’d assume truth would be the best weapon to use for this
---
Ok epic I'll try it out
---
Hey, thanks. I had no idea!
---
All questions of logic is answered with an eloquent "Space Magic", my young padawan.

Please tell me what exotics hunters have that give them an edge, current exotics in their current form. Also Hunters have high mobility, titans have high recovery and warlocks have high resilience, this is how Destiny designed the base character. But currently, my titan has 8m 2res and 6rec with mods. Hunter is the same with mods and only is warlock who is slightly slower at 6 4 6.
---
There are some doors (or fences) behind the wall which open that's it.
---
Look on Youtube if you want to see it.
---
I was hesitant about this, but after mentioning Bill, I'm all in. He was great at being ridiculous and funny yet still terrifyingly dangerous
---
Thank you! I'll keep that in mind! The revoker quest has made it immensely easier to stay positive towards comp, I feel good about this season!
---
OEM Titan asks: what's a primary?
---
Seriously!! They're a major hole in the game's economy and with Masterwork Cores finally in a good place, Legendary Shards have increased in demand. All Bungie needs to do is add them to the Spider's stock.
---
If your decent with Snipes I think Izanagi can one got body shot.
---
I wouldn’t worry about super armour pieces when playing s hunter. Your neutral game is far more important imo. A dragons shadow is arguably one of the best pvp armour pieces to wear because you’re always benefiting from it. 
---
Reloading all your weapons regardless of your dodge roll, extra sprint speed after a roll, and you might even get lucky with a decent roll of enhanced perks on it. 
---
Plus with a hunter, just put on x6 goldie and use it to shut down other roaming supers. No need for gwisin. 
---
If you don’t play a hunter, then ignore everything I’ve just said 😂
---
I forgot NASA lead the field in supernatural discovery...
---
I like this explanation. Do dark age/gambit weapons still fire normal bullets though....?
---
On the real, if bungie seperated from activision, its because they knew long before us how much bad impact they had on D2
---
And ai'm sure the seperation was a long time decision they either just didnt have the courage for it yet or it wasen't the right time because the DLC's were in production.
---
This was so hard to watch Lol thanks for the share.
---
No problem. Got the hive armaments last night. It’s so handy.
---
Truth and supers are the easiest, both will work on any map. Sniper will be a little hard but you might catch him off guard.
---
Glad i coud be of service
---
I'd say give let us turn them in to Petra for packages but Bungie won't give us Dreaming City lot that easy.
---
This is why I love the Destiny community
---
Wait but what was cayde..?
---
What have you done...
---
#WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!
---
I'd recommend getting the expansion now. It's $40 instead of 100 for everything except the moon one
---
You have to do it in 10 seconds, and they can't have even damaged a team member.
---
I'm dumb. What bonus is that? Been a Long time sinve I played Comp but I'm about to start my Recluse grind once I finish Lumina
---
Destiny 3 was an Activision idea. They’re now going to turn destiny 2 into a world of Warcraft sort of game where they add on to it again and again. It will be renamed destiny: new light.
---
Good job, bro! My clan and I are (shooting) for it this season as well!
---
Haha!! Thank you NASA but..  *CLICK*  I'll check for myself..
---
Did you complete it with 5 mins remaining and with other people on the same quest step?
---
Noble rounds shoot orbs that hella seek whoever’s closest, can even 180 to hit someone behind you if they’re closer than who’s in front lol
---
Sacrifice to HuGgIn
---
but my friend don't got any of the expansions , and I wanted to know why
---
Youtubers often are hype beasts by nature. "This weapon sucks, nothing to see here" doesn't generate clicks I guess.
---
Many a times have i wanted to push her ass right off the ledge she stands on

Not on equinox
---
A titan ( i think named tarlowe or something) died to thrall because he tripped on some stairs on his way to raid crotas end.
---
This is what I thought until I started using blink
---
Congrats dude. Am light years from fabled. I run with randoms all the time and then there are these 4 stacks of hunters at with Lunas who have nothing else to do but get into comp and ruin it for everyone else.
---
It's on IO, here a link to a vid - [https://youtu.be/kVNhdEPd9E0](https://youtu.be/kVNhdEPd9E0)

Bitch I can’t get enough of it
---
Assuming that X amount of glimmer in a clip is automatically processed into explosive/energy and Y amount into hard projectiles, there's no reason why the x and y don't add up into taking the exact format of familiar bullets and working just fine.
---
Although now that I think about it, why aren't all shotguns reloaded in clips? 
---
🧐 🤔
---
looks awesome, i must try it now,tq
---
In a world full of space magic and wish dragons... this is the thing everyone questions?!?

I never have enough simulation seeds
---
Shotgun magazines are built into the weapon, you load shells into the mag-tube which get popped into the chamber and ejected when the weapon is fired.
---
I specifically asked about Gambit weapons because most of them are also Dark Age weapons, which are by definition developed before the Golden Age and glimmer came around.
---
But what if you lose all 3 matches? It becomes a net loss right?
---
ARE YOU LISTENING BUNGIE?
---
Hmmm, do you think all the year one gear only scales to year 1 LL?

We have a community [discord](https://discord.gg/WnmRKUr) that is our clan members must join and be able to use voice communication when we are doing clan activities. We are mostly 24 years or older, and we all have lives outside of gaming we just ask that if you would like to join that you remain active.  If you don't know raid encounters, that is completely fine we will teach you! We also help each other complete milestones like triumphs and exotic quests.

If you aren’t sure why something is the way it is it’s always about the $$$$. They feature these guys for free advertising and somewhere in a dark hallway behind closed doors deals are cut and favors are given. Worlds first.....come on it’s the same group every time.
---
400% chance? That’s quite high
---
And it's still not funny.
---
Dreaming City gear are one of the few sets in the game that can drop with Enhanced perks; I keep thousands of baryon bough because all three of my characters have full DC gear and I never want to have to worry about farming them for upgrading.
---
I think you can buy stuff from the secret DC vendors with baryon bough as well.
---
Isthar is good, like I said, with this app you can create loadouts and switch all your guns to a character with one tap, runs very smooth and very quick. Can pull stuff from post master. I’ve been using it for a few months now and love it
---
Meanwhile I’ve  played 77 games in season 7 and haven’t broken 700 glory 😭
---
Sure. Advertising to viewers to donate for a children's hospital is all about the money for Bungie and those people you won't name. Stick with your theories but don't post this on Reddit where you waste everybodies time.
---
Mind PM’ing details on how to join the clan?
---
May God have mercy on your soul
---
Congrats homie! I’m one win away myself. Hopefully getting it when I get home!
---
Yes I did one of them last week it landed at 300 something power
---
I’ll have to check it out. I’ve always wanted loadouts, so this sounds really appealing. Thanks!
---
The one hit kill melee.....oh um the one shot grenade....oh crap ummm the way tether grabs right.....ughhhh crap ummmm let me think... uh can I get back to you on that?
---
As a noob, can someone please explain to me what this means?
---
Can I actually take you up on that offer some time? I’m not the BEST at pvp, but I’m I’d say mechanically I’m slightly above average. Just have a short temper because I solo queue because all my friends play PvE. It’s hard for me to go into groups and play because I feel like I might be an anchor.
---
PvP too sweaty on PC
---
You're going to have to rebuy Forsaken/Annual Pass, as you might already know. However, atm, these are not currently available on Steam, which is where you will be playing in September. So if you want to play on your Xbox account you'll have to wait until then, and also wait until they have Forsaken/Annual Pass on sale for $40 on Steam.
---
And here I am, disappointed I don't have a 4th slot to use for replaying the campaign again.
---
Let's play spot the bad titan main.
---
I mean, you had to use spectrals neutral game.
---
Slap that like button like your mama taught you right

Please link sub. I'm interested.

Congratulations, but this violates two of our sub's rules—direct image capture only and loot posts. We'll keep it up because it got popular but please remember these for the future, thanks.

What's a prison break to a hunter Vanguard?
---
...death
---
They should give you an ornament making fighting look huge
---
Petra should have packages in exchange for them that gives dreaming city gear imo
---
Yep
---
Appreciate it buddy :)
---
The tweet that started it all
---
Exactly.
---
QUIT PLAYING LIKE ME! I really need to trademark my moves, this is getting out of hand...
---
Use the in app lfg.  Works great
---
I haven’t played sos in a while but from what I know you can Farm this with the first chest (first encounter)
---
Why does everyone have so much of this?
---
The way I see it is that explosive rounds basically work like how fireworks change color depending on what you put in them.  They have a detonator that can detonate conventional shrapnel explosives (kinetic), or sone kind of accelerant or explosive that produces a different kind of elemental energy explosion.
---
I have a super similar screen shot from like a week ago lol
---
A single use super like blade barrage, nova bomb or rocket titan and pay attention to where your teammates are when the enemy  portal comes up and just go to the opposite side and wait for them to invade I got it my first game in the first Invade
---
*D1 flashbacks.*
---
Haha thanks I'm just trying to help out, doing my Luna's quest now so if I'm gonna play comp anyway might as well try to help
---
Actually, most of those don’t either.  Only suros smgs from what I understand.
---
You deserve that you jotuun using fuck. 
---
JK I use it too.
---
I could go for a calzone right now. Severely underrated pizza product imo.
---
I went to escalation protocol to test mine
---
I only use it in PvE and Gambit. I hate it in Crucible.
---
Brruuuhhhhhhhh
---
If someone lets you that's cool of them, but don't expect it or that's very uncool of you.  
---
Or a Saladin would say: Fight guardian, no-one will fight for you.  There is no windfall.  There is no respite.  If you arrive hoping you have what it takes - you won't.
---
*CammyCakes intensifies*
---
Can confirm, i went from only having 19 frames forged to about 45 in a month by getting the blue frames done along with the powerdul ones and doing one forge to get the whole lot done in one go.
---
Mmmhmmmmmmmmm... Me too.
---
A little about the link: this is what the title says it is, there’s a very quiet piece of OST that isn’t heard anywhere else in the game as far as I’m aware, decided to record it last night and upload it! Made sure to get way more than I need to make sure everything is included. Someone should make a mastercut combining this, “Gambit” from the Forsaken OST, and Shell of What Was/Shuro Chi’s Theme! Enjoy everyone!!
---
Don't the menagerie weapons and armor need it for infusion?
---
My sanity!
---
Skyburner’s oath doesn’t eject a cartridge, does it?  It fires micro rockets that have their trajectory programmed immediately before they are fired.  And considering that the other exotic cabal weapon that we have access to, legend of Acrius, doesn’t eject cartridges either, it’s possible that cabal weapons just don’t use cartridges.
---
fly by wire re-loading
---
Really?  I guess I've always killed the Captain first because he's clearly the most dangerous character - he uses his brain.
---
the bundle is like $40 right now and when the base game goes free to play the dlcs will still cost probably as much as they do now and Forsaken + annual pass will prob be around 40 so I don’t see much of a downside to buying it noe
---
Jumping off the map, killing someone, jumping back into the map again.
---
HA! You think this is an embarrassing play? Don't make me laugh you puny mortal!
---
Today I popped Hammer of Sol and I missed every single shot on the two guys that were right below me and they didn't even kill me so when my Super ended I just stood there in awe of what just happened so there, I made an even worse play than you.
---
I have 1 baryon bough and 327 enhancement cores, I NEVER go to the dreaming city
---
So you start by saying they are not overpowered and then list reasons why they are the best and can solo team wipe?
---
You gotta go get that objective!
---
I am tempted to grind out Lumina rn and then post it here just to annoy ya XD
---
Jk love ya shrimpz! :p
---
What else do you have in mind for that bag filler?
---
One-time I was invading on a team using sentinel shield for buff damage and somehow, despite landing behind the shield, I did little to no damage to the enemy team with my fists of havoc. I was a maaaad boy in that moment
---
ur game’s haunted
---
I have a means of punishing invader teams who do this. I made sure to implement such means my first 2 games to assure they lost. Afyer i got mine i started invading and helping the community.  Why do these subhuman toxic wanks play an mmo and act like such dicks?
---
Preorder anthology book.
---
No u ♡
---
He's tired of your shit, Kyle
---
"Job" lol. I cant wait for the 50% tax hike on " content creators" to get passed in my state and possibly by the fed this year.
---
Back in D2 I joined a team for crota that got mad that we failed a few times because a couple people hadn’t done it yet.
---
My god this is amazing
---
Do one for each of the areas please im begging you
---
I got Lumina the day it came out, Thorn took me a month lol
---
ヾ(*´∀｀*)ﾉ
---
continually boosting an item from DC?
---
WHAT ARE THEY USED FOR!!!
---
No. If your team refuses to invade to deny quest progress your team is a bunch of dicks who deserves to be added to a mass IP blocker net.
---
I use it for tinctures as I haven't been able to finish a certain quest
---
I don’t think so. Maybe they will do it like this season and have it ready day one after you finish the campaign.
---
I saved my super for the final stand and it was so disappointing that hitting xol was an insta kill on me.   Was so excited for super boss punchy, but no :(
---
Without ever going there?
---
To any future gaurdian who is wondering, the answer is no. Shaxx does not have previous season's pinnacle weapon quests.
---
and then "finally add an exotic hand cannon" like malfeasance, thorn, crimson, sturm, ace, last word and sunshot dont exist
---
I don’t know where you play, but I get into primary gunfights very regularly, and D1 is where you had to run a sidearm just to have special ammo. Just be because you can’t succeed doesn’t mean the game is bad. If you have skill, you don’t need to shotgun rush just to win. If you’re skillful you can easily counter shotgunners with things like fusions and snipers. I’m not saying that there aren’t any issues with pvp, but if you think D1 was better, you’re very wrong.
---
reckoning‘s haunted
---
Oh man he’s gonna get that one medal...
---
Lol nvm

I fucking swear! Do people not realize that they need to capture the fucking zones?! Jesus fuck! It’s not a god damn team death match motherfucker! Go capture the fuckin zones.....and kill some fucks in between.

---
Any level of power handicap or does those modifiers do it?
---
Thank you for the request, comrade.
---
breakstep_x has not said the N-word yet.
---
You have to retrieve your armour loot from the bank you put the mote in
---
How many hands do you have? Asking for a friend.
---
How do you preview those weapons on your character?
---
This was pretty awesome
---
When you get lumina you can get rose from collections with a range masterwork. It's very nice.
---
Wait what is this for?
---
You obviously pissed off the drifter.  Stop stealing his coins and he may give you your loot.
---
Honestly, OEM isn't even that bothering to me as of late.  I just don't even pay attention to it and play like normal when I get marked.  Maybe it's another story in comp but qp it doesn't really bother me.
---
If you have a truth it’s actually the easiest part of the entire questline.
---
Take captain
---
What armor are you wearing?
---
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu… that sucks
---
Tomorrow you shall discover this magical thing called **The Sun** (j/k)
---
Yeah Crucible is annoying because a few guns have a way shorter TTK than the rest.
---
I tell my wife I have one rule that will guarantee I won't get mad and that's try to have a conversation while I'm in the middle of an activity (specifically raids). Still talks to me and wonders why I don't respond lol
---
I live in Ireland so I never see that thing anyway ha
---
It's a chekov's gun situation - Bungie wouldn't make Cayde's dare applying to Uldren such an obvious plot point if they weren't going to do anything with it
---
There probably needs to be some clarification here. Buying the emote (1000 silver) gives a 20% discount when you pre-order the Anthology Vol II from the Bungie store, assuming you have already emailed yourself the code via Bungie rewards.
---
Feels bad man
---
You also get the damage buff
---
Notorious collector mask, opulent stalker grips, vest of the great Hunt, Orpheus rig and mantle of erfideet
---
I'd go for around 200 handicap. That will put you around a x5 multiplier.
---
I've used almost 800 in the last 5 weeks lol
---
You have the guns, Banshee has the Cores.
---
I believe back around 1100 BC an Irish man once saw the sun.  This is where the fairy folk legends originated. 🤣

Your girlfriend matters more than hitting max light, unless she succs
---
Hint of advice: Take your time, the gun isn't going anywhere
---
I wish I had that much alkane dust
---
Give me the plant.
---
Yeah, I know that, but after I hold E it doesn't give me any items
---
ive done that
---
Dammit, this is what I came here to day....
---
That was all your fuck up, you should have kept going around the tree.
---
Dude I have 2 stacks of these freaking things.
---
Or make them drop more in excess.
---
I mean you're a Titan. Just gonna punch everything anyways lol.
---
How you gonna kill him in two seconds
---
Bang
---
Another Halo fan? :) Mithrax could be Destiny’s Arbiter, which would be amazing! He could be a vendor in the tower which sells Fallen weapons to Guardians.
---
Also if things are too complicated with making Fallen fit the classes, maybe the Fallen could be their own class, It could have Fallen themed supers.
---
Being allied with The Spider and fighting alongside his associates and helping out his syndicate in Forsaken was amazing enough, so imagined how good it would be to have the House of Light integrated into The City and have them as an ally.
---
I have a 1.4kda and grinded it out in 6hrs?
---
Dope! Looks like shipping is a flat rate!

It's https://www.light.gg/db/items/4222882592/g-335-anseris-overdrive/ with midnight Smith shader

She doesn’t deserve you anyways, king.

Put them in your vault..  lol.  I have like 6-7 stacks of 999 in mine.
---
X
---
I have 2 please give me some
---
I was going to switch extinguish for heavy weight
---
I can relate to this so much.
---
The craziest this got was when I was doing the special Savathun's Song strike for Thorn. I called my grandma but she didn't answer her phone. 
---
So I started the strike and 5 minutes in I see a call from my grandma. I just ignored it. 
---
Some time later another call. Again, ignored it.
---
Some time later I see a call from my mum. Again, ignored it.
---
Some time later I see a call from my other grandma. Again, ignored it.
---
Some time later another call from my mum this time on WhatsApp... Ignored it.
---
By the time I was done with the strike (25-30 mins) I had 5 missed calls from 3 different people. I had to call every one of them to confirm that I was still alive... It took me just as long as the strike... LOL
---
That was the last time I made a call before sitting down to play D2...
---
Um but its shite in pve, it's a pvp quest for a pvp gun...
---
But he gave us an offer we couldn't refuse!
