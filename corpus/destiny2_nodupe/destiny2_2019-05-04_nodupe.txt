The reload time...
---
I probably should of clarified that I mean high impact sniper rifles, and high impact shotguns followed by melee. I don‚Äôt think all special weapons should one shot either, but there needs to be a reason for masterwork armour and I feel this would be one.
---
wait, wut?
---
I heard that spectral is receiving a need on Tuesday but don‚Äôt quote me on that. Well I hope you get that Cerberus soon, best of luck!
---
I'm aiming down sights but nothing rendered and I was firing bullets, landing shots :)
---
I agree brother, bank those motes.
---
I'm definitely not looking for someone to draw this out for free, but that is really cool my wife just loves tattoos and I've been thinking of getting one for the past 2 years just had no clue what I wanted until now
---
What kinds of armor mods are you running?
---
Pretty decent build, but id suggest trying Thunder Lord in your power slot
---
I honestly think there are very few people high in the comp ranks due to skip grenades or any other Revelry OP exploit. I tried many of the latter: warlock one-shot supernovae, skip grenades, tripmines spamming, perpetual invisibility, you name it. It doesn't help you get immensely better. It doesn't even help to outplay skilled opponents. That being said, it does make great players into god-like players. Hell, even skip grenade spamming requires you to foresee where the opponent is going to be.
---
Dude....it‚Äôs a meme
---
Super mods.
---
Banshee must of modified it
---
it means they haven‚Äôt got to the mission where they get their subclass
---
It's the subclass right at the start of the campaign when you don't have light back yet
---
9/10. ...no 360 before the kill.
---
I think that's someone who just started destiny 2
---
Why did you post so many times?
---
No. It's just what a brand new player is described as until they've recovered their Light.
---

---
Also, you posted this 4 times. Might want to delete the dupes.
---
oh shit i didnt think it was posting my bad
---
Took me 3 weeks of intermittent building while watching tv.
---
Mad Lad
---
Dude I want the ace of spades so bad
---
Those jesters are good times in Rumble with the Revelry on.
---
LH/NF nerf has been discussed at length already. Hundreds of posts since it was announced.
---
At this point, they're all considered spam.
---
What? Make it yourself!

I wish someone would tag with me for the story‚Ä¶
---
Oh lawd, he dummy thicc
---
Because they likely queued up for that specific strike rather than going through the playlist.
---
Best advice is to find others of your level and have a pre-made Fireteam. If you don't know anyone a clan is a good place to start.
---
\*potentially
---
If you don‚Äôt know anyone as well, make some looking for group posts to get who you‚Äôre looking for
---
Oh yeah that was my biggest worry, its not really heavy sadly but it is not super light it feels good in the hand (this sounds like a dick joke)
---
Thundergod I see
---
That's the only reason I'll probably end up spending more on one that was handmade, to get the weight and feel right
---
They should separate the lvl into brackets by default unless you manually override it if you wanna specifically play with someone that has a big lvl gap with you.
---
Yeah I saw one that was handmade but it as around 300$ US
---
In Soviet Russia, gun wear you
---
Also nobody answers in the local chat when you ask to group
---
I hope the do a rally for once. I want my sweet business catalyst.
---
Yeah, I made lots on Tera with feature of hidden HUD.
---
"I am!"
---
Not enough dakka.
---
I was trying to figure out how dick titan made sense
---
Lmao me too
---
I did what you said and I'm at 640 now, what should I do next? Ty
---
I make sure I don't pop my super until i know he doesn't have his, because celestial nighthawk will shut you down
---
I want my exotic dead orbit cloak back. I loved that damn thing. It made me feel good having done all that rep building to show it off.
---
Props to you for not leaving but sticking it out. üëçüèªü§òüèª
---
Getting a faction to level 25 was no easy task
---
You need a Ghost!
---
Guys i saw many posts about that you got fabled. I am Little tired about post like that.  Its not hard as you thought. Just improve your skill and will be ok! 
---
Anyway grats!
---
It was also originally meant to be a auto rifle, but the developers felt there weren't enough exotic weapon diversity, thus they turned it into a pulse rifle.
---
Did you print them yourself? I've seen people print screen or use heat transfer paper where you print your design and iron it on? They look great
---
Same here. Im missing my beloved Titan mark.
---
Ok so the joke was my character ran away because he never wanted to be team shot by 4 people all at once. Fail.
---
if its an eververse shader, it saves you bright dust to hold on to it, if it isn't then yes you have been holding on to it for nothing
---
Outlaw/feeding frenzy, killclip/multikillclip, and whatever range buffs you can get on it.
---
Bad juju was reload on kills, not precision kills it was a beast
---
Or the scorched remains of a Hunter
---
Gives me conniptions
---
We did Riven this week and she completely disappeared. We all just fell down and got the joining allies countdown. Then respawned next to her hearthstone in the black nothingness.
---
Yeah, it's a pulse rifle with the recoil of a hand cannon, whose only real use is pve, and even then, there are so many better weapons and exotics to use. I'm not swapping out my jotunn for anything right now, except maybe loaded question every once and a while, but even then, jotunn's fireball explodes as well.
---
I‚Äôm tired of all the nostalgia-blindness
---
Nothing has changed. Nothing will really change until Destiny 3.
---
Excellent points
---
I dont think they‚Äôre gonna nerf recluse that soon. It requires setup for it to be op, being a kill and someone in your proximity after it. Mag Howl on the other hand can be used in every situation
---
This is... best meme ever for me!
---
Even in situations like that, I prefer an SMG, especially my pillaged with outlaw and rampage. You dont have to worry about precision kills to reload, since smgs load pretty quick already, and I dont have to give up an exotic slot
---
i hate it when guns have perks at counter each other like, just have why can‚Äôt the gun just work with itself??
---
He's fine as long as he doesn't try to sell them.
---
Huckleberry
---
When one kid in your match has only the dance keybind
---
Y‚Äôall came inside her too quickly.
---
I love the huckleberry, I just like using other exotics in my other slots as well.
---
I am on console, and this gun handles extremely well.  I picked it back up last season and it already has 6k kills on it.  The recoil is pretty low, it doesn't have much, if any bloom from what I've noticed, and the catalyst does help some with the fact that is has some range drop off.  It's a hand cannon, so it still has to be played like a hand cannon, it's just a really forgiving one with headshots and gives you health back too.
---
I just loved the aesthetic of hawk moon I would love it back and please let luck in the chamber and the other perk to stack
---
I‚Äôm not scared of any man. But that thing. Scares me
---
"Killed by architects."
---
I had 20 and I said I‚Äôd stop using them and I forgot they existed then like a month later I checked and I have 400
---
Insurmountable skullfort + synthoceps with code of the missile. Crazy gambit add clear potential.
---
Or the fuckin apply bug strikes again
---
This seems to be a common perk combination, two of my friends have it too haha
---
Imaging this happening on Petra‚Äôs run
---
This has been happening to me a lot. I always find it funny when PC players complain how quickly people can switch around load outs mid-match then there‚Äôs us console players with this 4 year loading bullshit
---
Is this pc? I zoomed in as far as I could on my phone and it is perfect resolution plus the grass looks really high quality. Higher than mine at least....
---
Did you have to do the whole encounter again after that?
---
Ah no devs are found on reddit that how it was started
---
6...... MINUTES!!!!! 6 FUCKIN MINUTES :(
---
More like laughs AT Redrix. That gun is hot garbage now, and whoever designed the sights needs to be shot. If you could even hit them.
---
The spinning stuff on this map is good for trolling invaders
---
Ridiculous
---
Absolutely
---
----&gt; To be continued
---
Can't tell. It could be a invisibility glitch cause by server lag.
---
Not always. I run ‚ÄúLuna‚Äôs‚Äù and I get wrecked sometimes by people running Service Revolver, Duke and Trust
---
I'll reference unbroken and pray that the hiring manager is a guardian?:)
---
Gambit Prime would be faster because last season even with the triple infamy event that happened in the end of the season I was able to get to Legend and with bounties I forgot to mention but this season I grinded Gambit Prime with the same pace I did last season but with fewer bounties and reached Legend. In my opinion Gambit Prime is faster to get Infamy
---
Ok thanks üëå
---
Do it! It could be the very thing to tips the scales in your favour. Also damn good work guardian, you should be proud.
---
Not looking for an argument. I just disagree that it shouldn‚Äôt be talked about. Most games that I play that have an anti cheat system it‚Äôs pretty obvious from the moment you start the game. If there is an anti cheat system for Destiny we as players who spent money to buy the game should be able to get a straight answer to the question. It‚Äôs not an accusation
---
Not really, I read your title and wondered why you were yelling about the number 4.
---
You won‚Äôt regret it, I promise! It‚Äôs a beautiful thing when paired with a good cigar or pipe tobacco.
---
I always like highlands with medium to light bodied cigars. Maybe I'll pair it with a punch champion ;) feel like a commando. Thanks for the advice!
---
Absolutely!!
---
Yeah AoS is a beast on PC.  I rarely see Luna or NF on pc
---
Also u/dutty_handz is definitely a alt account of wang71, literally no posts in the destiny subreddit until this post
---
Go on lfg. It‚Äôs easier when grouped up and competent.
---
You need to specify if you play on PC or console first before we can really talk much about god rolls.
---
Look it up
---
Gets you the rat king if you do the quest
---
The first one is Air assault (increased handling when airborne). The second one is Headseeker (precision hits have increased damage when you hit body shots before).
---
Lol, this is always true.
---
Search for rat King quest
---
It‚Äôs a quest for an exotic sideam ‚ÄúRat King‚Äù.  You have to have a fire team with someone who either has the quest, or the gun itself, to advance.
---
Google it for details.
---
The rat king quest. Google it to solve the riddles. You have to do it with someone else who either has it already or is doing the quest. It's an exotic sidearm
---
ƒ∞t should be one of those Roomba things on the arkology
---
Head seeker is just as bad. It sounds good until you test it.
---
I will join you for the cause
---
Never thought I'd see a Heidi meme on this sub
---
Haha same. I love to crash trying to weave through the trains. Probably why the strike takes longer than it needs to. Oh well!
---
A man of taste :)
---
What do you mean bug? Like you can‚Äôt get vex samples?
---
Yeah
---
Ok man I have to disband my clan to join. It's me and one other play that typically plays with me in the afternoon at my house so we offer good co OP lol we are both kind of new to the game. I just reached lvl 50 on my hunter today lol
---
Once u reach the 15 minute mark your score multiplier will start going down till it reaches 0, and that's no good if you're going for a score over 100k
---
But..shaxx told me to throw grenades
---
I love the default
---
By the way, for anyone curious, it took me 30 last wish runs to get 1k, with 3 of those being after the patch that raised the drop rates, and 35 runs of scourge to get anarchy.
---
I actually don‚Äôt mind the grenade spam too much. It‚Äôs kinda funny honestly. I‚Äôve gone up against a bunch of 4 stacks of pole dancers in comp in the last 2 weeks and won about 80% of those games. They seem to think that just chucking grenades all the time will win them the game. It usually doesn‚Äôt. It takes skill and competence to win. If you don‚Äôt have either of those then grenades won‚Äôt save you from my fusion rifle or shoulder charge.
---
On a slightly different note, I played control the other day. On the opposing team was a Titan with Kepris Horn and he was spamming barricades! For a while they had a couple zones tightly locked down thanks to that. We barely won, that Titan carried his team with those fiery walls.
---
Thanks for the advice! I was looking at a package with an annual pass, but I‚Äôll def take another look at that when I get through the main game =)
---
Imagine night stalker TT + Chaperone + the sixth coyotye+ revelry booster.
---
Knights
---
U
---
That‚Äôs fucking annoying
---
It looks like your dick
---
So amazing and glorious?
---
Its fucking amazing. If i get a pc this is def gunna be my permanent wallpaper
---
Also, is this SFM?
---
Added Mobs To The Fight.
---
Aka shit that spawns to distract you from the boss.
---
Helped my brother beat Leviathan Normal for the first time, only took 2 hours and it was a blast. I want to try Last Wish and Scourge but we‚Äôll see!
---
And that's why I will never try Petra's Run.
---
I always thought it was because the weak red-bar hive enemies are called Adcolytes and ads sounds catchy
---
How is the quality of these? I've been wanting to get some stuff from the Destiny store (Mostly the Thorn hoodie) but if these are nice and sturdy feeling then I think that they'll make some cool ornaments to hang around the house.
---
I highly recommend getting them! To be honest, they are a little bit smaller than I originally expected, but they‚Äôre still super cool! The quality is amazing. It‚Äôs legit metal, doesn‚Äôt feel cheap in any form whatsoever. Plus you get a cool little congratulatory card that goes with it.
---
Bergusia is unlocked for everyone it's at the very bottom of the edz
