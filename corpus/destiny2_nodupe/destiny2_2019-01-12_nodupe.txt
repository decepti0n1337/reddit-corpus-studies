---
just so your aware activision has nothing to do with us not having crossplay, the contract between bungie and activision actually states intent for crossplay in the roadmap
---
nobody can judge uldren right now because he isnt uldren. We dont even know if hes going to stick with his old name either
---
Now kings fall was a pain in the ass.
---
&gt; And prior art is not a certification of soundness or validity. And your example of WoW started with the subscription model - selling expansions for additional charge still seems as silly to me now as it did when it was first released.
---

---
Except that expansions cost money to create, market, implement and maintain. An expansion is basically a new game with new content, but you can still access the old game and you can keep some of the cosmetics or whatever you've earned.
---
Maybe think of it this way: if you buy a 20XX Ford, do you expect to get a discount on the next year's model? No, absolutely not. Why? Because it's a brand new car that took money to develop, test, manufacture, market, ship, and then sell. Sure, it's got a lot of the same features and framework as your current Ford, and you can drive your current Ford for as long as you like, but if you want the new car you have to pay for it. Or wait and buy it used.
---
Does it really take "sick mental gymnastics" to acknowledge that game development is expensive and it makes sense that you'd pay for something that is new and cost money to develop?
---
&gt;Maybe you're using the word raid differently than dungeon, but if we include dungeon, that is absolutely false. Dungeons got about a 70% nerf after HoT, and to the best of my knowledge they were never buffed back up to their original levels. Well, at least not before I decided the whole endeavor was stupid and I decided to part ways with it.
---
No, I'm not talking about the 10-man raids. And the 5-man fractals, which are some of the most profitable end-game content the game has available. But sure, mourn the loss of dungeons - but it sounds like you threw the baby out with the bathwater. It's not ridiculous for games to adjust the rewards given for activities based on the economy and what features they decide to continue to support. It would be nonsense to have the really high-quality 5-man content in fractals while keeping dungeons the same profitability. 
---
Sounds like you want video games that stay the same but keep adding content for free. I recommend you check out Path of Exile - incredible game, entirely f2p (only money on cosmetics and increasing stash size), all expansions have been free and are top notch quality.
---
&gt;D2 is really just an online version of Borderlands, not really an MMO. There's no persistent world, there's no player market interaction, not really any crafting to speak of.
---
Lmao that actually is a really good comparison for D2, I'll upvote you for that.
---
There are lost sectors and region chests to do but I wouldn't really call finding those exploring as they're on the map... But the scannable things that are scattered around could be interesting. 
---
I feel you my dude
---
It’s kinda boring honestly...
---
But to each their own. 
---
THE TRANSACTION IS FINISHED! BE GONR FROM ME NOW VILE PUBLISHER! 
---
I do it because I like to admire the beautiful areas they create.
---
You don’t have to miss out. Come on at 9pm EST. That’s a little less than an hour from now. 
---
I'll give it that. Just got to the point where you end up on the first planet. Literally just took the snowy mountain with the world in the backdrop in awe. Then I heard the notification for this comment. Lol
---
We weren't even trying to get out of it, we were just so slow and messed up enough that it had already triggered by the time we got to it. On the plus side, hey. New dialogue!
---
They didn’t actually confirm it 
---
Sorry to get your hopes up..?
---
From what I understand it scales you too the listed content level +20 so if your 650 doing something at 500 your gear value will be 520
---
If your 510 doing 500 you only get +10
---
Night fall has a handy cap option and it raises the night fall level from 540 to what ever you set it to so you want to be at least at least 580 if your going to do a + 20 handy cap.
---
lol heres to hoping bungie takes destiny in the direction we wanted from the start
---
Haha ya! Scourge is fun and really versatile, good luck. Be sure to check the LFG finder for "hp trains" in PoF and HoT. They usually start in Crystal Oasis or Verdant Brink. Every once in a while a commander will lead people thru the maps on a very efficient route to unlock all the hero points needed to fully unlock a specialization. :-)
---
No, each new DLC is a new season
---
To be fair, Destiny was from her first husband. Activision is just the stepdad that was nice when they first met, but then was an ass to the kid when Karen wasn't there. Destiny finally of powered their dead beat dad.
---
This is a big no. I already have all the extiocs except for the ones that drop from the raids and if I didn’t I still wouldn’t spend money to buy one. Hell I refuse to spend money on silver and I already have everything from Eververse from all the seasons except the ones sold for silver.  I rather grind then pay. 
---
Destiny was always marketed to have multiple games, and they might carry over game characters and gear.
---
Or I'm just over thinking this....
---
So for Nightfall i should make the handicap, so that i am 560 so that im 20 over the recommended 540?
---
Icebreaker isn't in D2 and whisper is only one weapon, when have you run any legendary sniper? Whisper only works with power ammo as well limiting its use alot.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Bungie has a track record of making spectacularly fun games. This seems good to me.
---
Damn I'll never be able to do that with randoms
---
But you can't! They transform into beams of light and soar off in seven different directions. Once they land, they turn to stone for a whole year before they can be used again.
---
Clearly, this is a picture he took before using them!
---
They are always situational, I wish they weren't. I would love to have sniper maining be a thing in PvE.
---
People need to bitch? \*shrug\* I've been wondering the same thing since the game came out dude.
---
not a bad idea
---
OEM cares not for your paltry Telesto!
---
I aint gay bro
---
Petition for op to commit that. 
---
actually no it was marketed as a 10 year plan, nobody ever said whether that originally meant a continuous game experience or multiple games, until it was made public that the contract between bungie and activision was in fact for multiple games, but bungie has specifically stated they are more interested in creating a ongoing service type game instead of sequels, and now that they own the franchise they can
---
All this idea does is allow people to say “its pay to win”. Even though it’s not, it’s leaning toward it. It’s only a couple steps away from it &amp; Destiny definitely doesn’t need that label right now. Being able to pay for things that alter the gameplay in favor of the buyer is never a good idea. 
---
To be fair you are following the objective 
---
You can grab lore in some missions.
---
Everyone on this subreddit is setting themselves up for some massive disappointment. 
---
also your referring to the mandated development by activision, which is no longer a factor. And if they are going to carry progress/characters/gear over, why even start a new game instead of just continuing the lifespan, maybe updating graphics and engine assets
---
Yea, it’s annoying. That glitch has been happening for a long time now. 
---
But if I wanna read something, I’d get a book lol...
---
Ok my bad it was just the 100 million haha
---
I’d put my money on it definitely being the other way around. Activision wasn’t satisfied with the money made from Forsaken. Bungie was satisfied with the content, but never spoke on the profits. If anything, this should be a red flag that Destiny isn’t able to supplement Bungie enough to make content &amp; will cause them to increase the monetization of the game. 
---
There’s also already people talking about Bungie should start monetizing weapons. I’m hoping things work out because Destiny has the potential to be a much better game now, but it’s not lookin too good if we’re being realistic. 
---
Attention everyone we have a being from the future who literally knows everything ever over here
---
Definitely. I would never say someone’s opinion is wrong. I purely just attempt to challenge the logic behind the opinion for the sake of discussion. &amp; plenty of people were complaining about BA because of how things have been implemented. It was poorly implemented on release, &amp; then with Niobe Labs, that was poorly implemented for majority of people. There were legitimate complaints about it &amp; I don’t think many people were complaining because it was hard. 
---
One does not simply ask what is a yeet? 
---
I’m on pc unfortunately 
---
Wut? That has nothing to do with this.
---
Master race I see rip lmaoo happy grinding guardian 
---
PC - US - CT
---
27 y/o. Been playing for 2 months, have a 650 Warlock and a 618 titan. I've been an avid PC FPS and MMO player since I was 13. Previously played some competitive CS:S and L4D.
---
I'm just tired of sweats. I join into Crucible or Gambit and end up playing against full stacks running strats, while I end up with baby's first guardian.
---
I work a lot, so I play on and off, but I'm at the point where I can't progress or do anything without some group coordination. I'm in a friends clan to help with XP, but am actively looking for a more permanent home. As long as your 18+, mature, and willing to put up with me until I understand the vibe of your group, I'll make a great addition to your lineup. Just know I may not long on for a week, then go on a 5 day Destiny bender.
---
Scrapping exclusives? 
---
Damn nothing I can really do I guess 🤷‍♂️
---
this guy was doing it in the niobe forge, from a chinese guild
---
This time I’m happy karen took the kids
---
Yeah, as in Playstation exclusive items in Destiny. You do know what subreddit you're in, right?
---
[removed]
---
That’s a good question hahaha. 
---
Thunderlord loses to Queenbreaker though so QB is better for invading/killing invaders. For melting prime evil the best is melting point titan + 2-3 blade barrages and it dies instantly at x2-x3 PE slayer, don't even need power weapons to melt it.
---
You must be diabetic. 
---
Everybody look at things differently. Destiny is a looters shooter....it's all how you play it. 
---
(Yells in Asher Mir) Inaccurate!
---
Bungie signed a $100mil deal with Netease to develop a new IP, leaving Destiny free and clear. It’s a small distinction but an important one. Bungie does not have to make design considerations with Activision in mind. The success of Destiny can be explored without the need to maximize profits. Because the $100mil was for a new IP, Netease has no say in Destiny. 
---
The flip side of that is that that $100mil is gonna go quick. Between the buy out from Activision, the development costs for the new IP, and the costs to continue working on Destiny, bungie is going to need to generate revenue eventually. 
---
Here’s hoping that DLC and MTX was covering way more than their spending on keeping the business running. Instead of giving the money to Activision, they can keep it themselves. 
---
I personally don’t think Luna’s howl should be allowed in comp.  Especially till it’s fixed.
---
Took the picture before he used them 
---
Yes. Just earlier. 
---
We summoned when they had 20% health remaining on their primeval, just enough time to get excited and disappointed in 5 seconds
---
Just because they're splitting doesn't mean activition won't still get the money made from this game, even into next year. They're still the publishers of D2.
---
Well it has been only 1 day since the announcement and this is a big deal for most of us guardians (and bungie)
---
How are they indie? They're one of the most influential and successful game dev studios to ever exist... 
---
Because bungie has always been partnered with big publishing partners like with halo Microsoft funded them, with destiny Activision funded them, now there officially on their own with no one taking any of their slice of the pie. There going to self publish ie independent ie indie. 
---
I see no loot, and all shoot. It's not like borderlands where I can farm Terra for hours on end to get the class item legendary I want. I get two chances at a very low drop for the entire week. That doesn't encourage me to play more, like being able to grind for it would.
---
"The deal is to the tune of $100 million, giving the NetEase a minority stake in Bungie, as well as a seat on its board of directors"
---
They where lost because bungie went backwards with some things, the same thing would of happened if they made it an expansion. My point is they can call it d3 without having to make it a new game, or if they want they can make a game that is bigger in scale (fully open world memoir what ever else they want) and transfer all the character data over, not just the faces.
---
That’s awesome actually. I felt guilty about not jumping in on the last 2 titles, and only got the chance once the user adds had died down considerably. I can’t wait to jump in on launch with their next title
---
Community: Can we please have a new engine
---
Bethesda: (*chuckles*) No, infact were going to release a shitty multiplayer only game with little to no content. And we are going to update it for 30 years
---
Community: Why are you doing this to us
---
Bethesda: (*in a musical tune*) Because were Bethesda studios... and life is a fucking nightmare
---
Well I don't know anything about borderlands....I'm a battlefield, the division, warframe type of guy and destiny 2 been a grind to me and many other. Some ppl don't look at it like others. I grind to 650 on 3 characters. I grind for the weapons and the forge drops and so far things been good. I accomplished what I wanted to get done. RNG just wasn't good to you I guess. 
---
Hahahaha watch neebs gaming its a reference. 
---
You’re using Oathkeepers with no bow?
---
Like...?
---
Light level definitely has an effect. 
---
What weapons are you using? Class? Super?
---
Yup, Bungie LOVES recycling old content. 
---
I bet we even get the Moon at some point as DLC. 
---
Ringing Nail - AR
---
Can we also mention that the quest for it is also bullshit and incredibly out of touch? A rare bounty that most players are struggling to get, and when the do get one it requires a weekly bounty completion, of which they certainly already did this week to try and get said rare bounty. And the Shattered Throne, which is a three week wait time. So dumb.
---
Nope
---
Damn it was so obvious. 
---
that's a negative ghost rider theres another entire year of content already planned
---
It’s been pretty consistently documented that activision and bungie have been butting heads over the franchise since before D1 even launched, and its been reported by the likes of Jason Schreier. He also reported knowing something big was coming from a meeting at bungie before the big announcement, and also reported on the reactions of the dev team post announcement. He’s a journalist I’ve come to trust and he seems to have a very solid source within Bungie. I think you’d be super interested in reading his articles on it all. (Although I’m not sure how well managed kotakus archive is for older articles) I don’t disagree though, activision probably could have been a lot worse with this split, I’m glad it ended amicably for all parties. 
---
Why dont your friends pitch in and get it for you. 
---
 I honestly don't care what it is. Just whatever is best for pve
---
See where they are going with the drifter storyline I just kinda assumed that. Because the whole joining the darkness theme I assumed D3 would have both light and dark subclasses. Maybe the DLC will bring them like forsaken sort of did.
---
Or even legendaries that are good and that I can farm. 
---
Also love the “negative ghost rider”
---
lol😎
---
Do the Gambit quest for breakneck. Better than any exotic with the stats it comes with, if you really want an exotic primary, my favorite from destiny1 and 2 is Soros regime, second fave is crimson. Secondary slot is misfit with rampage perk followed by telesto, Lord of wolves(both carry over from D1 which should say something about the value) 
---
honestly they need to create a polished, new game, but include all d2 content as well as d1. then start building on a solid foundation, with game systems and mechanics set up how they envisioned, with a mountain of content to keep players engaged to give them enough time to start dropping sizable content updates
---
Yeah, they should revamp everything, shove all of D1 and D2 into the infinite forest and do some extra stuff and call it a game.
---
I didn't really like Lord of wolves. I actually have a few misfits. What's the Gambit quest?
---
When I played it was intentional. Only dreaming city items were guaranteed to give upgrades everything else only had a chance to raise it by 1 or 2. Even dreaming city had a chance to give items that barely upgraded you or were the same level. If this is a bug that was already addressed by now someone please let me know, because my post could have been made out if misinformation and not knowing.
---
Telesto has got to be the best pve secondary ever. I've been getting creative with it on multiple adds by painting the floor and letting them just run over and vaporize. Takes bosses down like a heavy
---
If you have left over frames from a previous week they'll disappear because they are not on offer this week.

I just mean that a graphics and engine overhaul, with all previous content, should be a starting point. Then at least everyone can agree that hey we have a stable, polished game with a large flushed out-multi campaign, planet spanning world already, then start the continual game approach like an mmo n
---
So happy. I main a Warlock and Hunter and I have to say on both classes it is equally annoying. That's when you know something is wrong.
---
How do I get that?
---
Yeah I feel they have a great base already they just need to take what they have now and reformat it to what can actually have longevity
---
Your only hope is to delete the bounty and "HOPE" for another one.
---
I get at least three a week, even on non curse weeks... I'm not sure why I'm so lucky with it.
---
Ah, ha guess I'll just have to wait and see what route bungie decides to go. Maps as they are not really long range weapon friendly unless you do Gambit. 
---
For all the people, it's Forge armor and Forge weapons. Always. Raid weapons and armor doesn't count for these bounties.
---
Yea dude we all play through with our 'wives.' What else would you hold the controller with?
---
Nice, I remember my first raid. I have 9 prestige calus clears so that means you have the potential to do it too. It’s actually kinda fun when you do it with people you like
---
Yeah, that's how speedrunning Will of the Thousands feels like with a Thunderlord.
---
I also forgot about nova warp and shadow stalker
---
Lol. That's a good one. 
---
That's harsh. I ONLY care what random streamers say. Excuse me while I Fortnite dance over to my mini-fridge full of Redbull fam.
---
What does "must be acquired" on the Merciless catalyst mean?
---
Well done Thor Ragnarok reference, have my upvote.
---
Same here. I see only 1hc radiant frame.
---
Yeah I use both thanks I've made probably a good 20 very good friends from the fireteam menu. 
---
Depends on the strike honestly and I'll run a sidearm for crucible with a scout on the regular and have a decent to good game, like I said it's just what you're used to playing, I was one who would take the dmr or sniper in Halo and it'd work, used to take a semi auto or sniper for search and destroy modes between other games and it still works
---
There is also a thing I've found out where some sidearms can beat out shotguns in crucible more frequently then other weapons that take kinetic ammo
---
Sure I get what you're saying (basically saying) that on paper, the stats and normal person use may not add up to be as efficient as what other weapons may say or show, but if you have somebody who is proficient and successful 8 times out of 10 with scouts, snipers and sidearms (handcannons are in a kinda good place they just need a few more imo) would you worry how you would if you only looked at the base stats and on paper proof ? (If that makes any sense?)
---
Long story short trying to free up any confusion
---
If someone is used to running that type of load out and can run that load out successfully would you worry ? 
---
Oh yeah, heard about Nova Warp being ridiculous. Teleporting all over the map, killing people in the next room over and taking out entire teams with no effort, some times twice. Haven't heard much about Shadow Stalker, what's wrong with them?
---
You know if you preview Shaders in your collection while holding an exotic it shades the exotic as if you could.
---
Oh God, is Bungie now gonna be stuck in a time poop beginning with the split from Activities?
---
OP probably already had it though
---
Broken hit box can get you when you armt even close. But at the end of the month they are needing blade barrage, nova warp , spectral blades but buffing most other supers.
---
A moment of silence for all the enemies inside that poor quest (3 crown tempests 😂)
---
alright, alright, alright let’s see what we got
---
Destiny lore requires a masters degree in shit-lit. Long story short, there's a big ball.
---
I've got one lol
---
*stomp mechanic
---
FTFY
---
I Telesto'd the crap out of some OEM Titans today - can confirm, if enough bolts hit it eats overshields for breakfast.
---
Thanks! Will do
---
You must have been writing this when I made my edit. Browsing this and the DTG subreddits should provide you with all the discourse your heart desires.
---
Yes but it's being nerfed in about two weeks
---
No context Drifter made me lol
---
Wait a second...
---
It is? Craaap, that thing was one of my favorite Exotics for melting miniboss crowds in PvE
---
You will find that on here, you're only asking for knowledge which I have had to do to the same result. Here is an article that isn't exactly what you're looking for but it will affect the very near Destiny experience. You may find and article outlining the other changes through it I am not sure.
---
https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47570
---
Balanced glide. We're gonna try out tractor Cannon with 3 Nova warps on the boss fight. Are fallen immune to it though?
---
/r/forbiddensnacks
---
Polaris Lance can help alot in the final room, if you make it to the first room with about 12min left you're on a decent pace just try to leave 4-5 minutes for the final room if possible and keep at least one super and some heavy 
---
better nerf hunters again
---
best part of solstice of heroes was campaign missions without cringy dialogue tbh
---
I thank you for the link and you find that everywhere man, I'd just personally like to hear what the players think of it instead of the black and white, maybe it's partly my fault because I didn't word it right but maybe its not, again I appreciate you for adding the link and apologize for you having a previous experience like above thank you!
---
Really? People still honestly believe that the company that has a product earn 500 million dollars in three days and consider it a failure; the company that will add microtransactions to a remaster; won't do everything in their power to milk as much money as possible?
---
Bungie isn't blame-free in this, but neither is Activision.
---
I did my first one with a LFG when it came out try doing it that way
---
Bruh it's not your stomach that needs help it's your goddamn eyes
---
Ol’ Calus and his loud ass cup
---
You know the meaning of the word “Exclusive” right? XBox has NONE! Why? Because you can also play them on PC - hence they are NOT EXCLUSIVE. 
---
I'm just trying for anything tangible Activision did. XP throttling was all Bungie too. 
---
I'm not too sure, if any of you have chaos reach I'd say one run that due to it's melting capability and then maybe dawnblade that can extend the super Nova warp on one of you for ads if the three novas don't work, just trying to think back to when I did it, because whoever uses that dawnblade hits an ad throws a sword or two and keeps the process going against the boss, nova can clear and chaos, well causes chaos but honestly use the playstyle you're all comfortable with that will get you the best results I've found 
---
I am ghaul, and your furniture is mine
---
Actually I think that’s Vigil of Heroes. The vanguard one from Zavala 
---
Yeah I heard that heavy doesn't drop, hopefully I won't need it until the final room. Thank you!
---
Oh man, I think it's a toss up really
---
Why would he not shoot?
---
Can't wait for the day Ikora loses her cool and just goes berserk. Nova warp big enough to engulf a continent or nova bomb making a crater like on Io
---
Heavy drops got nerfed terribly in it and you're welcome, also at least one ad clearing super normally helps, if I may ask what is you(r fireteam) running character wise ? (I'll try to give the best advise)
---
Good
---
Yeaaaaaaah.... It's only getting a PVP nerf. PVE will be unaffected luckily
---
Could be either
---
Thanks for the tip
---
It's okay, i know a guy
---
Woah hold up the traveler looks even more broken did I miss something?
---
It has the markings on vigil, so it is
---
It looks like the titan and warlock are wearing Y2 armor as well, so i'm going to say it's safe to assume that's the vigil of heroes chest piece.
---
We have three hunters and a warlock with golden gun, spectral blades, blade barrage, and Nova bomb
---
Incorrect! 
---
When Bungie spent 2 years on D1 and then had to scrap it all and throw a new version together in less than a year that was Activision! They then did the same thing on D2. Bungie had a much larger and immersive game planned but Activision wanted staggered updates - less content, more frequently. This is why the launch titles are so underdeveloped and cut content ends up being reintroduced. Bungie NEVER had full creative freedom. 
---
Lord Chanka the greatest killer of them all
---
I feel like sans undertale when my eye starts a’ glowing
---
SPOILER!!!!
---
It was caged up by the Cabal at the beginning of the game, which took away our powers. At the end of the base campaign, we kill Ghaul, but he transcends into light energy (I  think?) Then the traveler wakes up and bursts with energy, tearing away the cage and some pretty big parts of itself.
---
The game has improved a lot since launch but you need to be an endgame player. So just participate in raids, grind for certain weapons and make sure you always have a goal you’re working for.
---
I'm concerned. 
---
They are like suuuper rare drop chances now. My brother actually managed to get 3 in one day.
---
My first D2 raid was Last Wish. Did all raids in D1 but still haven't done Leviathan....
---
Because people want to turn the event heroic. And you can't do that if you kill it.
---
Ditches Activision only to pick up NetEase. They went from US greed to Chinese greed lmao, NetEase is hardly any better than Acti and a larger disconnect from the games they publish. They got out from one boot to crawling under a new one.
---
Thanks a million buddy. Will try to glide now with some patience. Somehow the Blink gave me the most distance and not hard to use. Only thing is with blink u cannot control distance and many blink yourself to death in jumps with multiple gaps. 😆
---
I’m glad I’m not the only one lol
---
No I know that lol, it seems way more ripped up that previously, I’ve been gone for about a month or 2 and it seems different now 
---
I dont have the one eyed mask yet it's the last forsaken exotic I need and when i will it will be bloody
---
I find this heroic difficult lately since everyone just kills him fast. I've hit the players and danced in their face but they dont know how to do heroic I guess.
---
Alright, if one of the hunters is comfortable with it arcstaff is actually probably the best ad clearing super for the first room (I'm a Hunter main so that's just what I run for it) also I think, but don't hold me to it, I think arcstaff stuns the boss after several hits if they didn't change it any
---
Warlock is probably fine with nova unless they have chaos, id just say use that even if not fully upgraded cause of the base damage for the boss, blade barrage probably works well, spectral with the vest is probably a good choice as well and Goldy is probably good if you're using celestial, but again please use what you're comfortable with that's just my personal opinion on it weapons come and go but you guys (and/or gals) should be good 
---
Thanks buddy. Which is the best jump type for long distance? Somehow blink works best for me in long distance.
---
How to engage glide, press jump twice fast?
---
I'm sorry sir but this is a Christian subreddit
---
Ok buddy, will try double tap. Any specific type of jump/subclass? Thanks.
---
THANK YOU! For the life of me I couldn’t remember what this was referring to, but it was so familiar it hurt me to not know.
---
This is an old post when the forge came out
---
I would like to see the option to upgrade a current roll to enhanced stats. Would greatly make it worth. Enhanced on every piece or armor would be so amazing
---
Yeah, this is so stupid. We should be able to join on the forge immediately as if we're doing a strike
---
Thank you so much for this advice, it really helps and I think I'll take your advice on the arcstaff thing. I hope this goes well.
---
we kill him in like 20 seconds with Well of Radiance and Luna Faction boots... its nutty
---
Thanks guys. Ok, Sunshot vs Risk Runner for PVE, which one? 
---
Which one has better dps vs bosses?
---
Not a problem, I got what I wanted out of the game so now it's my honor to help give advice or help people get what they want or need 😄 (also  use raiden for arcstaff if you have it, it helps alot ) 
---
Ahhh you stubbed your toe on the way down, and then smacked your head.
---
I know that spot well. 
---
Must be the angle or something, idk haha
---
"We are not disappointed with Forsaken. We set out to build a game that Destiny players would love, and at Bungie, we love it too.   Building Destiny for players who love it is and will remain our focus going forward.
---
10:01 AM - 10 Nov 2018" Luke Smith tweeted this when Activision said Activision was Disapointed in forsakens sales.  
---
  As for choosing to leave it was probably them being stubborn to conform to activision on making a bad change that would upset and hurt the playerbase at that point. 
---
As of right now we have zero information about D3. It could be years off, if it ever happens. 
---
I got he game two weeks ago did the quest a week ago its not hard ull be aigh. did it at 568 light level.
---
Except for the fact that with that purchase, you fed Activison. They still have the publishing rights to D1/D2. LuL
---
Pretty much all of destiny 2 if you don't know any of the lore
---
Thanks for the confidence m8!
---
You summoned me?
---
What part did you look up and find, just curious. Breakneck isn't luck, it's a real fucking grind, but by far the best auto rifle offered. Better than any exotic
---
&gt;!I didnt want to mentioned that Bungie actually owned by a chinese company named netease, company that mainly works on mobile (maybe some heard about them from diablo immortal). I didnt want to mention it because some of you still have hopes for the game.!&lt;
---
nobody cares about destiny anymore, that why activision didnt really fight for the rights for that game. 
---
destiny used to be a star in the genre, but there are so many other better looter shooter games coming up.
---
anthem,the division, and we got free to play warframe. not to mention all of them got "free" updates and liveservice and not paid dlc shit in 2019 haha. I mean it gets to the point when dlc give more than the base game and cost more than the base game.
---
ea just showed us how easy it to make a cool looter shooter game (anthem), wasnt really hard for them, they just took a good studio and made a new game.
---
activision/blizzard probably saw how easy it to make another game in this genre, and destiny got a pretty bad reputation already, so..
---
its like EA taking studios and shutting them down when there is no good profit, its the same here but bungie isnt studio owned by activision so they just let them go.. 
---
**You talk about stocks but 7% is nothing compared to what they can lose if they keep investing in this brand and it will keep failing over and over again.**
---
**Mark my words, destiny 2 will be dead in couple of months (because of the games I mentioned), at this point there is nothing that can save them. but maybe if they will change their way of work (shouldnt be a problem anymore because there is no activision but who knows) their next projects will be better and good and maybe they will get their reputation back. but if they will keep working like now again its just DOA.**
---
I use chaos normally, but tractor makes stuff weaker to void by 50%, and does it's own damage. So a bunch of Nova's would do tons of AOE theoretically.
---
A single guaranteed Enhancement core on level up, with the chance for more increasing for every other Masterworked weapon/armor equipped. 
---
Where's the cheese
---
Nah, it's outclassed by pretty much any legendary shotgun with decent range: if you encounter someone with dust rock blues you will die before shooting half of the pellets of the first burst
---
DAMMIT TODD
---
That is true and that is theoretically but the one thing I've noticed with nova warp when doing stikes or weekly bounties on my warlock is at least for me nova warp isnt the best for damage but if you can get it to work then hey go you and your fireteam (again I can't really say anything about the new supers for the quest exactly so I'm going off of what I've seen in strikes when i was using it)
---
May have something to do with the power level of the enemies. I also had a problem but loaded up the mission “the corrupted” (rather than the strike) in the Dreaming City. There are 3 Yellow bars upon entering. Easy picking and worked for me. Hope this helps. 
---
Well I was hesitant to get the annual pass myself, being broke as all hell, but i got a little bit as a gift from a friend and decided to get it when i read more about it, its 30 dollars for all three seasons, of Week to week content drops. Rather than dlc here drought here dlc there drought again. I've probably put in about 200 ish hours just because of it. But its up to everyone themselves if they wanna buy it ultimately.
---
For anyone wondering you go up the right side of the public event side and you can climb your way up then go behind a wall.
---
It's random, but your chances of getting it are from public activities on Mercury. Sorry bout that Mercury is the worst toilet in the system, no running water, no sparrow use to get around, and fucking Bummer Vance is a mouth breathing idiot
---
I see you activated the pyramidion prestige mode boss fight. This happened because you shot his head off but did not kill him before the game tried to transfer to the next phase.  
---
Its definitely possible to beat the strike/nightfall this way, my friend and I completed the 650 Lock and Key mission doing this exact thing with only two players. It definitely makes the strike more fun, however you need to be 100% prepared to bait the boss to areas where your fireteam can run to the next objective without being murdered.
---
No, you didn't found this OP. Bungie twitted this and you merely reposted it on another platform.
---
But nice sharing it tho, not like i'am against it.
---
Except for the sCrEeBs. No one will kill the sCrEeBs. They embrace the sCrEeBs.
---
Well I think three Nova's could do something. We all got off tonight because of cabal excavations over and over
---
r/Pareidolia
---
I mean, the Hive are arguably the most interesting enemy race in Destiny and Eris is, aside from Toland, the leading expert on the Hive. So I think it'd be enlightening to talk with her ad nauseam about those creepy, death-worshipping bastards.
---
.....that and I find her attractive. Sue me!
---
Have you unlocked the Dreaming City? Have you unlocked and fully upgraded all skill trees? Do you have any desire for unique nightfall items, titles, or in general achievements? 
---
I know people say this game is grindy,  but compared to Warframe and actual MMOs, it really isn't. 
---
What's the shader for the warlock? 
---
That could be something worth seeing and yeah those suck, I'd personally say I'd do just a regular strike (maybe lake of shadows since it's faster and easier) and see what it does there first but that's up to you all 
---
For me at least as a Hunter I never know when to use my blade barrage cause what if I need it later or I think that there isn't enough enemy's to make it worth 
---
Same here.
---
Me - runs off in opposite direction wondering where the enemies are
---
Yea ive done dreaming city ive fully upgraded aswll :) atm no cause getting together a squad is a pain in the arse. im not a titles or achievment guy but i did notice this games grind isnt bad at all. I mean im enjoying it for what it is i just wish it had more you know? Ive played a lot since i got it so that probably doesnt help but i feel like its also not an excuse to have a lack of content for people who actually put time into the game. 
---
Savour the moment. Your first raid only comes once
---
The PlayStation exclusives were an Activision requirement so will most likely disappear anyway. I wouldn't be surprised if bungie agree some exclusives with Xbox instead 
---
If you also do the basic forge ignition frames that you get after doing the unlock quests it’ll eat up the powerful frames you can buy.
---
Why gotta be a salty bitch lmao
---
The baby servitors first appeared during the Solstice event for one of the reworked story missions.
---
There were tons of servitors everywhere
---
I am a hunter and can confirm this, btw noice thor reference lmao
---
Unlike raids, it is possible to solo nightfalls, and even to solo nightfalls with high scores. 
---
The only things not possible to solo in this game are the Rat King quest, Legend of Acrius quest (requires Leviathan raid), and the raids. 
---
Have you done the Shattered Throne dungeon? It's only available every three weeks, and it's here right now. 
---
As per usual, Goth implying that the Destiny community revolves around him.
---
For anyone who hasn't done raids before, please use /r/DestinySherpa  
---
It is an amazing subreddit for anyone wanting to learn any of the raids or raid lairs. We also do Whisper help on the weekends!  
---
And if you're on PC, message me and I'll help you out myself.
---
Luna?
---
people are so delusional in this sub its so funny.
---
it is maybe the other way around Activision to Bungie.
---
dont you think its a bit strange Activision didnt care and fought for the rights of the game / to keep this partnership?
---
tbh I dont, Destiny got a bad reputation already and so many other better games coming up in that genre so keep investing in this brand will just make them lose more money. so this is exactly this meme, 
---
"Activision : take your game and fuck off"
---
I have not whats that? 
---
Yeah same with me and Antaeus Wards I have gotten like 5 exotics since Antaeus Wards became the last exotic I needed and yet I didn't get it.
---
How do you get it? Also, whats that armour it looks sick
---
This hits close to home. You have no idea how many times I’ve had my hopes up just to see that pop up.
---
Smh
---
Damnit, I need someone like this, attempted the first forge quite a few times and can never kill the boss 😩
---
[one shudders to imagine what inhuman thoughts lie behind that mask](https://www.destinypedia.com/images/thumb/2/21/Adaa1.png/300px-Adaa1.png)
---
that's a mood and a half
---
I’m happy for you...
---
#But now you’re on “The List”.
---
Still haven't done my first raid and I've been playing since just before Forsaken dropped. Finally planning on doing SOTP because my friend wants to do it but its only the two of us. Another friend is gonna buy the annual pass so we will level her up and try
---
Woof
---
Congrats man!  I actually got 6 exotics in the span of the past 2 days, and only 1 of them was a duplicate.
---
Praise the sun! Rngesus has blessed me 
---
Oooh that would be pretty good 
---
My sentiments exactly!
---
Literally the dumbest comment I've seen on this sub. Congratulations 
---
Yeah my son of a bitch friend managed to get a few exotics in like 24 hours. Le Monarque, 5 minutes later Orpheus Rig from a random ass Cabal I killed, then Jotunn, then Thunderlord. I know he got a 5th but I forget what. His exotic luck is usually horrid.
---
So Retold Tale and Thunderlord? lol
---
The Trickster strikes again...
---
why not visit Xur every Friday? Sure it costs some shards but once you're in end game, you usually have a bunch of shards lying around to spend anyways
---
I don't see any kind of cheese here, all you did was use banner shield to buff and protect your teammates, you didn't abuse any kind of glitch or bypass any mechanics
---
Guys just up vote and share , it's a feature that should be in the game . Yes we are that we can inspect how it looks as if we could apply the shader , it's in the game so we should be able to apply them. I'm assuming only some exotics would have to be worked on so they apply like the Vigilance Wing or maybe certain ornaments 
---
Lord Tachanka is in Destiny 2? Who knew!
---
I just googled it must've been either old or not right. My favorite weapon is auto rifles. How do you get it then. 
---
Yes that is a pretty good loadout, and pretty scummy as well
---
Send me a message with your in game name. We have some people in our clan without mics and it's fine. When we raid, so long as you listen and chat back everything works smoothly
---
I know I had to do a couple adventures to unlock the heroic this week and it took me 2 days to finish it. 
---
In your defense NOWHERE, in the entire goddamn game, is there ANY reference informing a player about how to make an event heroic. I had to look up every single one of them here because none of them are obvious enough that you just do it accidentally.
---
THEY BROUGHT IT BACK!!!
---
Been leaning towards RT.. With a Duke haha. My laptop can hardly handle the game, so no PVP for me :(
---
I just hope they add more stuff, instead of making it more expensive. Ornaments would be cool, auras n shit
---
that crippling feel when you have 1 friend who plays D2 and you've never raided
---
I have all pre-forsaken stuff. Just a waste of my time going to him.
---
I would imagine it would be D3 and it would be content not mechanics
---
*Aye aye, Captain!*
---
lmao zavala really doesn't care about cayde, does he
---
And D1
---
1.the other dlcs are behind a paywall and it can be pretty expensive especially forsaken for $40
---
2.seems fine
---
3.idk
---
4.they're ok and plus they got a lot of new supers and they're all good
---
5.you should always be able to increase your power level for any exotics except now you can use any primary weapons to upgrade primaries like in destiny 1 and so on
---
6.there is one very challenging thing which is the quest for the wish ender exotic
---
7.theres new abilities and new grenades for some sub classes
---
8.don't really care much for those
---
I just think he's emotionally suppressing the notion of how much he's lost and with Cayde, it has just mentally broken him. 
---
As brash as he'd like to be about this he can't, because of the weight of responsibility he has to hold down the fort with everyone. He can't let it out without throwing people into a panic.
---
Just my take though 
---
I think the cabal drill could be done by accident.
---
I’ve always been trying to kill the ships.
---
And now Increase the render slider to like 125%-130%. It will Look even more gorgeous! 
---
*distant shrieking can be heard* 
---
take a shotgun to face titan bitch
---
Are you thick?
---
I kept triggering Glimmer Extraction heroic and never figured it out until i looked it up. Kept killing those drills in the crossfire.
---
As for the others? You'll always get Ether Harv if you're new (low damage weapons), cabal drill is easy to figure out, hive ritual was a lucky guess, spire construction i stand on plates instinctively, warsat's just murder instinct
---
Turning that event heroic is part of a step of unlocking forges.
---
sometimes people just wanna knock out their dailies
---
It's a little hard to repost something... If you haven't found it yet.. Am I missing something here or are you saying he didn't find it or something?
---
When they lost Halo they learned a really tough lesson in making sure they own what they make.
---
Aw i used to fucking love that game
---
Not titans!
---
I remember figuring out a good majority of them. 
---
Ship shows up midway through? Shoot the ship.
---
Stand on platform and a crystal on the wall will lose immunity? Shoot the crystal.
---
Vents open in between phases? Shoot the vents.
---
A bunch of shriekers that open part of the way through? Shoot the shriekers.
---
I will say that there are a few that are just confusing with no sort of way you should be able to figure them out. I spent over an hour on the prison of elders one and the blight with friends trying to figure them out.
---
The new forge is at 650, can drop curated rolls and Jotunn
---
Bungie posted this on their official Instagram page and captioned it "Heroid cryo-pod event"
---
They know, they just don’t care. 
---
Flapjack was a good show
---
A true madlad
---
Cabal on the field!
---
7 exotics in 1 day? lol right
---
Name checks out.
---
Nova warp is broken, i agree, but i would prefer to see telesto altered in PvP personally. It needs to go back into the heavy slot. Absolutely ridiculous!
---
Me and my buddy just got done grinding the final forge for one. He got the bounty, I didn’t. Rng my dude
---
It's no wonder he doesn't understand flowcharts, he didn't even make this one himself.
---
Must have been the day for it. I got 2 dupes of it today 2 strikes in a row. All i wanted was my riskrunner catalyst in the same day i got the huckleberry one, after 70+ heroic story runs...
---
I use back up mag, I know a lot of people like target but for me the recoil is nothing on that gun 
---
always gotta be that guy that shits on everyones happiness I guess
---
ya you got almost all of it wrong 
---
"carrying 14 motes"
---
"no one can send a blocker"
---
lol
---
It’s even further with the new forge
---
working as intended to be sure

Time to learn how to play Gambit.

If you're on XB1 feel free to message me as well. I love to Sherpa and don't mind taking time to explain mechanics and teach people the raids. 
---
Warmind DLC (Max Light 380): You and your ghost heard a distress call from the planet Mars and must investigate the potential threat of a Hive Worm God and a Necromancer and uncover the last Warmind.
---
Things you should do: Escalation Protocol (Ikesos Shotgun) Whisper of the Worm Quest and the Sleeper Simulant quest
---
Forsaken DLC (Max light 600): You and Cayde encounters a prison break in the Reef and must stop any loose prisoners from escaping. Discover the Dreaming City of the land of the Awoken and uncover a legendary monster that lives beneath the city.
---
What you should do: Campaign, Dreaming City, Weekly Milestones, Last Wish Raid, Shattered Throne, Exotic Quests.
---
Annual Pass Black Armory (650): As a gift, you were accepted to work with Ada-1 to reignite the Forge and Forge new weapons.
---
Things you should do: Forges, Scourage of the Past Raid, new season vendor weapon quest, Niobe Labs. 
---
618, but on PS4 in the uk, cheers for the offer though 
---
I got it.. I got the last Sleeper node.. the grind is over..
---
well i just finished 1 match and i got 100 kills and 30 multikills and i do have to complete 40 matches so there is time :D
---
Yeah I'm PC. So Activision will no longer get money from Destiny content ?
---
“Found”? Or you just happened to notice that Bungie themselves shared this too? Lol
---
Bungie as a game is owned by Bungie, but Activision owns the rights to publishing the game. They gave those rights to Bungie. I don’t see how that’s sketchy? Probably pressure from Inside Bungie pushes Bungie to work out a deal where they both walk away. And here’s hopes to the next game being on steam
---
But I need to shoot the big fallen
---
My friends and i are always looking for 1 more.  Have 5 on regularly but not the 6th. Look me up ad add me if on ps4. Ddunk. Leave messag please. 
---
I don't see how that has anything to do with the above?
---
If you're talking about Activision/Bungie not being properly split yet, the Bungie update said it was planned/in the process of happening, not that it has happened.
---
No worries, I can be horrible with my wording (lol)
---
If on ps4 add me, Ddunk, we always looking for a 6th
---
3v4? Hell, I get pissed when I'm in a 4v4 match. Gambit is just no fun to play in its current state.
---
Known issue
---
sigh reeeeeee? you did admit to it but this was from the Destiny app
---
Wait, you got an emblem? Which emblem?
---
Shouldn't the hunter be the one telling the titan not to slam or punch. 
---
I mean thats kind of what we titans do, its our melee ability and almost the whole of the striker subclass
---
I also like the nova warp, though I needed time to get used to it😄 I don't like the sentinel Titan tbh. But yeah the well of radiance looks cool as well. 
---
i dont think destiny 1 actually had heroic public events
---
\*distant vooping sound\*
---
i always insta kill it because the time spent waiting isn't worth the increased milestone percentage
---
What Banshee Sells: he will sell one weapon mod and one Armour mod for 10 components which changes each day. Example: yesterday for the Armour mod it was gernade mod, today is a super mod.
---
Wanting a specific mod: You'll have to wait daily until he sells a specific armour/weapon mod that you want.
---
Where can you get mod components? : Normal way is by purchasing them from Ada 1 if you have the annual pass. best way to get them is by dismantling gear before Forsaken DLC. Forsaken loot does not drop mod components. There are videos to farm them.
---
Other ways to get mod: legendary forsaken loot will have a low chance of having a mod on it. Dismantling it will give you that mod
---
Black Amoury Mods: Ada sells unique weapon mods with also the cost of 10 components 
---
That's strange I'm not to sure where it went what app do u use the d2 app or the vault
---
I finally managed to do the Ogre with a similar set up on my hunter, Transfiguration, Le Monarque (This was actually really good for adds and breaking shield), Hammerhead (Bossspec)  Took me 2 dmg phases, was happy with that.
---
It’s called Ishtar commander
---
Im at 70 in 350 hours... I fear the worst is coming up
---
What helmet is the warlock wearing? I know the chest is frostreach.
---
I've never heard of that 1 I'll check it out 
---
okay, changes every day, got it, thanks!
---
works for Warframe, Rainbow 6, WoW, EVE... just have 1 game constantly updated.

If anyone needs help on Xbox and isn’t a child can pm me. 
---
Activision didn't decide to have static rolls on weapons or make Mercury not allow sparrows, or limit XP gains...
---
Activision can be blamed for some things, but not all of them. Now at least ALL blame goes straight to Bungie with no scapegoat.
---
Where is the “ice breaker?” 
---
Got a 45 kill game last night and after anyone did damage to me I just quoted this post
---
I know it all too well.
---
What's a yeet? Can someone explain this to me? Is it a cross between a beet and a yam? 
---
I feel a little offended, because as a hunter I wore the EXACT armor shown before
---
Give him Celestial and it will be my life trying to get heroic events done
---
I'm an Xbox fan but please no. We can't have cross-platform character progression if any of the platforms have exclusive items, and I would rather have that than just a couple extra weapons and a strike.
---
Blight one is the hardest to make heroic, cuz the giant blight is so damn tanky, and every time there's other people with me they all kill the Taken and send the ball elsewhere.
---
Microsoft has no problem with cross-play, Sony would be the ones Bungie would have to argue with for right now.
---
https://youtu.be/ah7PBFt1meA
---
What do you mean hard to miss it? You kill the guy in one super before those vents even start spewing gas. If you don't know to look for them you miss it every time.
---
Lol, I was wondering what was going on. Thought someone was trying to troll me or something.
---
Frickin Bungie... There’s always that one guy stuck on a jumping puzzle
---
Its for treating 9 cats has a cat on it blue an black i got mine just last week 
---
Just guessing based on the design, it’s the Gambit Sniper Rifle.
---
As long as your fire team doesn’t leave the raid
---
That's the same helmet my Titan has.
---
Lord, I hate that helmet. 
---
And those are the “play anywhere” exclusives, games that you can play on the pc when you log into your Microsoft account that owns the games, you do realize not all exclusives are playable on pc correct? 
---
Cry me a River Justin 
---
What’s ever funnier is people using Luna’s in comp to troll people trying to get it.
---
Luna’s should be locked out of comp until they fix the broken ttd.
---
So you have to finish the raid on the time that you input the code?
---
Justin?
---
Bungie didn’t say anything about super duration just extra bullets so I wouldn’t count on that 
---
Spectral blades should also be nerfed, no super should last an hour and half 
---
I love the titan tangled web helmet so much. Shame the rest of it looks like AIDS.
---
Hm. You don’t get the reference.  
---
All the issues wrong with destiny have nothing to do with activision. 
---
Well he is dutch, van der linde is a dutch sir name
---
Clansmen say jotun only drop from bergusia with powerful frame 
---
With solar burn it was so much fun! His sniper was two-shot-ing us but we managed to stay alive and get the plates, 10/10 would shoot his head off again. 
---
Well I guess you should be able to tell me how good the bow is then?
---
Yeah I should’ve clarified more. I meant I think it’s the frame that’s important and possibly not the forge 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Seriously, who does that? do they not have anything better to do with their time?
---
It's really good on the hunter with the oathkeepers cause u can hold the poison shot forever
---
Yes otherwise you’re loading a completely different server instance? That is basic online knowledge. 
---
They will be there for the length of that session only. If you go to orbit and come back, you’ve got to put wish 14 back in.
---
I not long done it and this how I done it;
---
Enter raid
---
Enter code 14
---
Enter Kalli encounter for egg
---
Enter code for x encounter
---
Enter x encounter for egg
---
Leave raid
---
Enter wish 14
---
Etc etc
---
Only one I found I couldn’t do solo was the egg after Morgeth Ogre. So we did it normal way and got it after. Again, made sure wish 24 was active.
---
That’s what I thought
---
I tried that on some guy yesterday, he had this moment of indescision then followed me over the side, only to somehow jump back up and escape.
---
Taken blight took the longest for me to figure out.
---
Portal destabilizing! Get ready
---
It's not that bad when you play with friends, I'm sure my clan would love to have you. 
---
Nice
---
Where is felwinters lie?
---
But those have free dlc.
---
During the Christmas event I would just plow through them as fast as possible because I wouldn’t get any extra ingredients for doing heroic 
---
I don't think he offers more than two at a time, you have to wait until he has the mod you want. 
---
Blade Barrage has also been nerfed
---
100% Accurate
---
He needs to be wearing a celestial nighthawk mask. 
---
And?
---
lmfao
---
Worded poorly, meant the long steps (like do 50 headshots with a bow, those steps) and then the reward being An RNG roll after you finish crafting it
---
{-}7
---
Try Ishtar from the AppStore. It’s item management is much more enjoyable especially when you want to transfer a currently equipped weapon.
---
Activision got custody at the weekend maybe
---
How fast can one change Helmets? 
---
Should be Titan as Hulk wanting to smash xD
---
I finished redrix last week. Kind of wack and disappointing gun. I like my blast furnace and bygones more. But still fun grind. 
---
If you know how to get to the underbelly where the watchers are, you can just re-enter the room they're in. They respawn when the doors close and you reopen the doors. Repeat 6 times and you got your 24 lens.
---
I don't know about balanced but its definitely the most boring. I dread using mine for anything
---
Yup. Just cant let hunters have anything nice. 
---
I hate that sparrow so much. I once ran a nightfall where I got my third Otherside and a friend got his *tenth* from the chest.
---
Dont sell your accomplishment so short.  Its a great achievement and you should be proud.  Congrads.

He was being sarcastic

I didn’t either until I gave the quest a go. Now I appreciate enjoy the pvp way more 
---
Telesto lmao hahahahaha
---
So they can also move faster than any other subclass.  So health focused with oversheild and max speed with shoulder charge with oversheild.  Seems like a pretty crutch class to me, to be defended by those that need said crutch.
---
But it’s okay that we disagree.  Says a lot about each of us.
---
...the heck? Reminds me of this week's Ascendant Challenge, where I kept getting killed by physics glitchiness every time I touched this one specific floating platform (which was totally stationary mind you, it just kept golfing me off into the void like a wannabe Phalanx)
---
Idk how to get to the underbelly, but I'll check out YouTube for that. Never done the raid. Thanks for the tip! I want that Izanagi's Burden soooo bad.
---
"And if we got to suffer, then so do you"
---
Oooooooooooohhhhhhhhhh!!!
---
Good job mate getting Luna was my best achievement in d2 felt great 
---
I used to farm Levi for seeds. Just killing the guys up front gave me about 4-6 seeds usually. I switched to doing the mars ep, just the first level give you enough to finish the mission and doesn't require jumping into orbit or anything like that. 
---
it’d be cool if they had special waves. Maybe every 3rd wave in the set of 5 ( 3, 8, 13 etc. ) there could be all yellow bar enemies, ghost has to scan a point while you defend it, capture a point, killing enemies causes them to explode &amp; deal damage to players, only kinetics can deal damage, player health drops over time &amp; kills will replenish it. Just little modifiers like that that could keep things interesting. 
---
Yeah this is just pure bullshit nothing. Of. The. Like. Of. This. Will. Ever. Happen. Thanks. 
---
I think shaders need to be reworked entirely. It’s still bullshit that shaders cost us to buy.  But yes I also agree we need a lot more space everywhere in general.
---
Bungie: "We listened to community feedback and we think we handled all the complaints from destiny 1"
---
Community: REEEEEEEEE!
---
Still waiting for you to read me the description
---
As a solo PVPer, I care. I hope that will be me someday. Congrats!
---
# TRAVELER! DO YOU SEE ME NOW?!
---
so was i (a little bit)
---
Ttk*. Yeah its 0.64 secs. BUT you need to hit 2 headshots. So if you are bad it doesnt make you better
---
Yeah, I’ve managed to pull of those so far. Still haven’t gotten the barrel perks I want or drop mag but I can’t complain. 
---
No
---
Welcome to the club guardian
---
Nope. That's a loading screen.
---
I'm not joking.
---
i had a high rank streamer who was doing a recovery for a client help me get my last 200 points lol
---
That’s what they implied. They seem to be in full support of Bungie
---
Ah ok

I think most people are doing Bergusia for the chance at a rare bounty, plus the fact that Bergusia can forge any weapon. 
---
Now get it to Volundr
---
The lvl 7 boss drops it. 
---
the weapons drop from the boss themself, the chest after 7 doesn not give the gun.
---
balanced by the way /s
---
I swear my friend had nf within a week of getting lunas if not like 4 days
---
Is feeding frenzy only on certain guns, or is it just super rare?
---
As far as I can tell, they are separate drops.
---
Well good luck to you !
---
Yeah, glory rank is account wide. You can hit it on another character and when you sign back in to the one with the quest it should complete. 
---
Please show me a video in which one super kills the boss. 
---
Agreed, but I don't think bungie will allow players to skip the story, since it'd be like admitting the campaign is lackluster.  
---
I did it 4 times on 2 characters but didn't drop for me
---
Ahhhh... thanks  :)
---
What a relief... thanks.
---
Atta boy. 
---
I savored it like my last bite of spaghetti
---
Yay, 3 Mountaintops when I hit Fabled
---
Late to this post but what do you infuse into the gear to make then wearable? So far I've only got the helmet and Mark but they both have 10 defend which lowers my power level considerably. Just wondering if you infused other pieces to get better?
---
I love shooting the cup
---
i know that feel, each loss was so painful after i got into 1800 range, 
---
believe me , im pretty good quickplay but im no sweat by anymeans and it was hard ! 
---
I’ll eventually have to do prestige for Legend of Acrius 
---
Can we newer players still get the quest for it?
---
Not anymore.  *puts on sunglasses*
---
Fuck.that.gun.
---
well im on ps4 and everyone told me to put target adjuster, how many bullets does backup mag add?
---
enjoy!
---
Is that range increase on the masterwork? That's a pretty nice roll.
---
#NEEEEEEEERD
---
i was solo until 1800 then enemies became much more skilled so i only did 4 stack after that
---
:D
---
How do you like sagira's ghost
---
Nah, stompies make me over jump almost every time xD
---
Yes it’s masterwork is range increase
---
i know some people liek that too, they arent human
---
u already know
---
So ya..my ankles woulda been broken on that first obstacle.
---
Adds 3, I play on PC so its probably different. Go with what the console players suggest for sure
---
Good question, there could be mutiple answers to it: Firstly as the contract says:
---
"Bungie will receive between 20 and 35% of cumulative operating income for Destiny, depending on the total amount of income.
---
Bungie is eligible for a number of performance and sales-based bonuses depending on Destiny meeting certain development milestones and sales goals"
---
Why would they cheer? Bungie stops making a small percentage(possibly only 20-35%) from Destiny's profits and now makes 100%, possibly 90%, I predict they will sell the game on the Epic store. Also as the contract states their bonuses was based off sales, I dare say with Activision stating its displeasure of sales a lot of people didn't receive a bonus, and these people under Bungie will most likey see a a pay bonus noting there profits from the game may triple. Also they don't have any deadlines from Activision that would affect their pay. 
---
The idea of them wanting to go on their own for freedom and make a better game only a year before the contract ends doesn't add up for me, especially when they annouced that content would remain the same. so I would assume it's profit driven.  I also think that Activision had a major part of this split and had a lot of good reasons why it wanted it to happen. 
---
My brother was like this in ESO... kill everything that moves and if it doesnt move, find a way to make it move so you can kill it.
---
Now that I switched to destiny I kill everything in site regardless of mission or need to... oh the tables have turned
---
Yoink, your RNG is now mine.
---
Congrats either way
---
Bring back my fucking back fur god dammit.
---
F
---
i did solo all the way up to 1800, its possible! i actually had a worse time with fire team in the beginning, worse match making
---
Hope you feel better my dude, what happened?
---
getting the quest from shaxx, completing a ton of quest steps and finally getting to Fabled glory rank in competitive 2,100 points
---
duke mk44 with rampage and rapid hit
---

---

---

---
no scavenger perks on armor and I'm using Stomp-E55
---
I have heard that sniper rifle scavenger does not work on heavy sniper rifles. I don't know if it's the same for grenade launchers and shotguns.
---
Reserves perks should work on all guns of the proper type. 
---
Wait lunas has random rolls? Guess you can get a shit luna...
---
i went solo until 1800 and then had to get some good stacks to play with to get the last few streaks
---
keep at it!
---
no it doesnt have random rolls
---
Lord Tachanka what are you doing here? Scram!
---
Well it says 'Random Perks : Cannot be reacquired from collections'
---
Have you ever tried knowing what you’re talking about? I think you should try it.
---
This subreddit is not the most welcoming of posts where people want to play with others. You will have far better luck in /r/fireteams, the official Destiny 2 app, this subreddit's discord (not super lively, linked in the top right), or the /r/destinythegame discord (linked in their sidebar). 
---
Depending on what platform you are on, you could use the PC LFG  discord server (lfg = looking for group, join link: https://discord.gg/EbNTem requires link previews enabled in discord settings), the built in xbox function that lets players find each other, or /r/FireteamsPS4 
---
Congrats!!! You want to help me get mine😁😁😁😁😉😉😉😉
---
yeah but you can just buy it again from shaxx, just like the gambit reward weapons with drifter
---
Found one boys
---
Can you keep rerolling the perks from shaxx then?
---
good job. I’m hoping to get Luna’s before the new season. I’m not that great of a pvp player but I have fun for the most party. I have a good team that will help me when they are on. I try not to get tilted cuz I know I’m not good. I only get mad when people message me and tell me to ‘get off the game if I can’t get a 1.0’.  Please give me a break...
---

I mean, over in the Annex after you land in the hangar, there's a room with a bunch of frames, minus 1. 
---
Can I use this opportunity to find good players to grind with? =) I want it! I'm on xbox
---
Tether boizzzzz.
---
Srsly tether and wotw and it might be possible to solo it. 
---
I know that. You know that. But does Joe Blueberry know that?
---
Rip nova warp and blade barrage
---
Alt: "speak to Ada-1"
---
Awesome I've been working on it too not easy with the current meta for sure.
---
You will want to buy Forsaken (just regular Forsaken, no need to worry about bundles  or the annual pass). I think it's $40? That sounds like a lot, but it does add basically another game's worth of content. 
---
Congrats!! Ive only cleared my first raid last reset
---
Sadly no. What I also don't understand is the rush to do the event, especially for flashpoint. Doing it faster doesn't make the other PE's occur any faster, so you might as well do the 2 min longer version for more progress and less sitting around 
---
NDA creates important time gap. so pre-orders can accumulate. Because of false advertisement and censorship. Control the flow of information. Currently massive censorship is going on with EA's destiny(Anthem) and UBISOFT destiny(scamvision 2) on their subreddit and because NDAs were signed for alpha testing and believe me people will stay silent because they are worried they will lost their accounts or even get sued. Hence they made the laws for themself and they have control of information.
---
example: if testers didn't signed NDA they would be able to speak freely about the broken game just after testing but they can't so scam marketing machine can do their scam job and get pre-orders.
---
or reddit supports censorship... like now I have to wait 9 minutes to talk freely... unnecessary delay... and if delay isn't enough mods will just remove posts and proper reddit staff won't do nothing about because they are too busy collecting premiums and selling ads to children.
---
For the most part, class composition is not very important. It only really comes into play for end game activities such as raids, Shattered Throne, or high scoring nightfalls. 
---
Different classes have abilities that can buff their teammates or debuff enemies, and multiples of the same one don't stack. For example, if you and your friend were both running Well of Radiance and placed the two wells in the same spot, it would only have the effect of one well. Whereas if you were one titan and one warlock, you could use the titan to apply the Hammerstrike debuff to the enemy and then both stand in the warlock's well of radiance for a big damage boost to that enemy. 
---
&gt;Can someone actually confirm
---
No one can confirm this as far as I know. 
---
Strikes till lvl 50. (horror story is not lvl dependant so feel free to use it to have higher light that you should) and after 50 do stories. When you finish you'll be at least 640 providing that you have at least one 650 character.
---
It worked for me. I was using 600 power horror story on my lvl 30 titan. 
---
I saw that a while ago when I was still playing Overwatch, I think it means something went wrong or that there's a bug 
---
I hope that didn't patched the rifle tho. 
---
wow you are so delusional it's sad. the NDA covers the CLOSED ALPHA AND BETA, not the open beta. Also that really did not answer how bungie creating eververse had anything to do with an NDA. You specifically said bungie could have not created eververse, but that it would break NDA. lol fancy language and phrasing isnt helping you much if you wont answer the actual question
---
Second line is in french if you were wondering. 🇫🇷
---
Last one, it may be russian. 
---
r/everyfuckingthread
---
They’re roombas. 
---
I would prefer Well if Radiance for my play style. Stuff that helps keep me alive longer with the healing grenades and the super Well. I might feel different if I had Geomag Stabilizers. 
---
Is it really worthy to masterwork it...?
---
It’ll probably be  — at least in PvP — only a problem on PC 
---
Does this count as a 360 noscope?
---
Unlucky! I think I’ve had near enough 10 now. But I play quite a bit of gambit. 
---
I’ve been very unlucky with exotics since forsaken dropped though.
---
I mean I main warlock and I'm glad they nerfed nova warp it is stupid broke
---
I pass it on my way to and from school
---
Ya, it's a Duke Mk44, with the y1 raid shader.
---
Duke Mk44
---
Haha, yeah, 360 hip fire headshot.
---
What roles?
---
Yes she plays well warlock. 2 warlocks have not worked well for us this far
---
I guess I’m a little confused.
---
You mean when you use the consumable that guarantees a piece of armor?
---
I'm doing this right now...
---
I think I'm gonna go insane.
---
so making fist of havoc attacks cost 85% less super energy is ok but spectral blades lasts to long?? wut? lol 
---
Hope you get banned
---
As another warlock main, I don't think it was that bad. A bit overtuned but not broken. That being said, I still used chaos reach over Nova warp because it looks awesome, especially in gambit.
---
Good ol' Ghostcrawler. 
---
Outlaw and Rampage. Also have a rapid fire kill clip, and rapid fire rampage, but i like outlaw / rampage more...
---
Just do one round forge, the step three gave you as many as possible 
---
Chaos reach is so fun in gambit
---
I would try Chaos Reach then. It’s better for being able to stick near your teammate and strike at range than Nova Warp. 
---
Well no but you posted a passive aggressive message and got a passive aggressive response. There are tons of things I don’t have the money for so I get it.
---
I don't buy from our I have most exotics I've been playing for about half a year
---
yes
---
This includes gear/weapons in your vault.
