Man I spoofed on the drifter the other day, we were talking about how Ted Cruz should move to Ireland and become the prime minister. But when Ted heard about our advice he decided to spit another tonsil stone at his daughters dog. They've since had to put the dog down R.I.P Kumlord

Maybe it might be a thing... for 80$.

Its funny, just around the same time as bungje leaving Activision, and things started going well for the game, the hate Warframe had for destiny started going away and being replaced with... Companionship? I dont know why but the players have started being nice to each other...  And om happy about it
---
I can only speak for myself-- but I don't do raids, none of my friends play, and I still get hours and hours per week of entertainment from this game (i've been playing since launch). Apart from the occasional lfg for exotic quests I'm perfectly content playing solo
---
This belongs in comedy cemetery.
---
I know! It's like sometimes the game decides to actually take into account that someone made it to cover before the knife was even near them. Deplorable, I know, but sometimes this game just doesn't function the way it shouldn't.

Stonetoss openly supports Nazism. Not Nazi-like ideas, not ideas the Nazis happened to support, but the Third Reich and its unique terms and ideas. It’s not just liberals throwing out insults; he’s as close to being a Nazi as he can realistically be.
---
What’s better?
---
i remember that but never even heard " destinykiller" other than the jokes from my clanmates
---
I haven't seen anyone from the Warframe community say that, mostly just "destiny isn't my game"
---
Right?? I jus wanna get lost in there for days! (Knowing I have access to my ship any time of course :P)
---
Alright so u cast BB there 3 people one in front with a shotty one in the back sniping and the other looking away with a bow the game is like hey fuck that guy with the bow and all the knives lock onto him
---
They you surely didn’t spend enough time playing warframe
---
cmon man don’t crush my hopes and dreams
---
So i dont have to do raids so what version do you think would be best
---
No, its not real. The only exotics that have been confirmed are the ones shown in the vidoc.
---
I’d hate to be on the receiving end of that

The more i think about it, your opinion isnt worth anything.....
---
Ok, couple of points here. I just checked and the option is to abandon the item which I did, but when I did that it did not refund me a ballistics log it refunded me a modulus report. Some of the frames require a ballistics log and some of them require a ballistics log, not quite sure why that is. The description on the Machine Gun Frame says that it will refund a ballistics log on weekly reset. I already had plenty of modulus reports, but I did not have a ballistics log so I could not choose some of the frames. Anyway long story short, I got a Sniper Rifle frame using a Modulus report which says in the description that it too refunds a ballistics log on weekly reset. I'm going to wait till tomorrow to see if I get a Ballistics log which is what I really want. If not I'm only out a modulus report, I have plenty of those.
---
Sorry about your bad memory!
---
I don’t do raids never have. I play Gambit mostly and to the weekly power drops and planet bounty’s and such. The raid is just a small part of the game. There is plenty to do without the raids.
---
What is free speech then? What are friends? Imaginary?
---
Get fucked.

I play plenty of both, enough to know that the Warframe community is often times more kinder than the destiny community

Well then your region must be pretty toxic lmao, since all I see is either people saying they enjoy D2, or have no interest in it
---
I'd rather raid in d1
---
k
---
I’m just gonna block you now then I guess, it’s been fun watching you try so hard to annoy me and fail
---
This right here—^ And it applies to your other classes, too. My crew are all lvl 50 and my Hunter STILL requires the 2 matches in comp. It’s a Shaxx mission where, like the Vanguard before, he’s giving you a tour of all the features. The most I could agree with you on is that at the very least that step should be a level 20 minimum, post Ghaul. They’ll still likely get wombo-combo’d, but less ragdolled than a level 4 with no abilities unlocked, that’s for sure.
---
I unforunately still have a 1tb hdd casue i wanted to save up and just get a 1tb ssd and just transfer everything over but its too expensive at the moment. Might just end up getting a 480 gig and just transfering over D2 and the main files so start up is faster.
---
isnt that what the game is
---
You’re*

Why did that worlock nova bomb inside wtf
---
If u nova the bubble it will break and kill the titan 
---
That’s a special warlock right there
---
Old if I’m doing this wrong, but I just ran a timer for 30 minutes and only got 52 from it. 4 resources per run. So I’m just over 2 minutes for a complete run.
---
Nice
---
click on head
---
Dude I spend $100 on legendary edition and still have to pay to play forsaken so just Choose Wisely. Play the game a bunch til something is locked against a pay wall. Make decision... Doubt battle net and steam copy are compatible so steambath release for you is not really an option unless you plan to repurchase the base steam copy again
---
I know! That’s what I was saying. If that warlock would have just stayed back then Nova Bombed me, he could have won.
---
Like you said, that is a special warlock right there. Haha
---
What kind of farce is this?
---
And load into the beginning of leviathan lol
---
Yeah i just looked up verity on YouTube and apparently even though its slow it does stack with devour giving you tons of energy
---
DAMN!!!!!
---
i dont know, i dont think its competitive to have huge advantage against other players that solo que, competitive in my eyes means fair in a way. And i dont agree with the last part of going in a game with 4 stacks knowing what the results will be. Id much rather wait. And adding solo que will make many 4 stack players start using solo queue
---
Things will change, sure— but a lot will remain, for the better. There’s a TON, and I mean TON, of things to do in the game right now, and that’s even if you choose to primarily main only one class and feed gear to your others passively like yours truly. Pinnacle quest weapons, hidden missions, RNG exotics both weapon and armor that could drop sooner or later for you, exotic weapon quests that go through multiple steps— lots of these can be tackled through thoughtless multitasking. Plus, if you’re a fan of pvp, it’s always good to get that time in before wafflestomping the other fresh meat, even a little bit of time (plus you’ll be unlocking abilities and fine-tuning your pvp/pve/pvevp kit). If Warmind and Forsaken weren’t out and it was just Curse I’d Osiris I’d tell you to hold off, but right now the series is in the best shape it’s been since The Taken King/Rise of Iron.

RDR-style prologue but not with a different character.

Not the poster but mine has snapshot sight, alloy mag and rampage.

This should be one of his lines. If it already is please link it lol

Hammers are a garbage super though. Right now the rankings are hunter dodge at first place, then bottom tree striker then dawnblade.

Great shot! This is why you don’t butt hug your teammates
---
Can I just leave the game when it looks like we will lose and I don't want to make my crucible standing worse than it already is?
---
"There's something different about you, Guardian. Oh I know what it is. You're the biggest man in the world now and you've grinded out Bad Juju!"
---
I can admire quickscopes but hard scoping makes me mad
---
I think BA was pretty solid all told... 4 forges, a new way to 'craft' targetted gear, a fun raid, 2 exotic quests, and a bunch of small lore bits. 
---
I only just finally did the 'Mysterious Datapad" quest thing and was pleasantly surprised by the short cutscene. My exo already has a big robit-crush on Ada-1!
---
Using a bow as well! Nice work.
---
in that case, wait at chokepoints where you know someone will pass by. This works especially well for capture, and you're doing your team a favor, too.
---
Thanks a lot of people told me i wouldnt have enought time to play
---
They tried that with Y1 snipers and shotguns as "heavy"... Yeah, no thanks.

It's worth taking your time for that. 80% is a lot.

Has to be done in the same season.
---
There's a polygon article about it, the secret is out.
---
It killed itself with the start of D2 but its self-resurrecting
---
Quickplay?
---
Seeiously?? 
---
It's just casual people are free to do what they want
---
I'm absolute garbage in PvP. I was invading a lot in gambit today chasing the light vs light triumph and I got a one man army while invading. Then I got another one. I ended up with 12 guardian kills that round alone. Yet I have a total of 40 glory points after a week of trying for Recluse.
---
I agree with you. That’s why I refuse to use it. PvP is moving into a direction that I actually enjoy, but the only problem I have is when a gun exists that towers above and beyond most setups you can use.
---
Ah, you're doing great! I'm more a pve player personally. Pvp and gambit used to unnerve me because I was always afraid of messing someone elses game up. But, I just keep grinding it out. Haha I also had some crap internet connection and pve was safer than disconnecting from a crucible match and messing up my team. Same with gambit. Have you played prime yet?
---
Damn it destiny is a sunsinger main it all makes sense why they cater to warlocks
---
Heat of the moment. I really just mean comp.
---
That was fucking amazing!! I also need a new pair of pants now
---
Understandable for comp, haha I understand. I have the same heat.
---
That article also states the head of ea played the early anthem (beyond) and said where's the flying this isn't the game you promised. So they had to start over. The whole thing was a disaster. It's sad. Anthem has very fun game play and looks amazing
---
What the hell are you feeding that sniper rifle?
---
I agreed first of all. The only caveat is flawless execution and one eyed mask. Niether effect the ammo off spawn arguement, but both effect the oppressiveness of snipers rn. Getting blasted the second you come around a corner is pretty hard to combat(cant flank if they can see you).That being said I dont think the ammo economy around special is an issue. More these 2 perks are just really good. Not calling for a nerf just stating what I think the actual issue is.
---
As a former hunter main turned warlock main, they're both really good.
---
Personally I just enjoy the warlock's skill set and glide better than hunter's.
---
One thing that will always get me is trying to Marksman's Dodge to reload when I'm running warlock. Guess old habits die hard huh?
---
I hate to break it to you my man, lord of wolves is not the first overpowered weapon to terrorize PvP and it won’t be the last, oracle lens, Luna’s Howl, Mida multi tool, last word. We can’t lose our cool when a new one shows up. We die to it a lot and then we figure out how to counter it, ranting about it isn’t gonna help you deal with it.  Not trying to attack you my friend this is a realization I came to during laser tag era and it has helped me improve in PvP
---
Nah don’t have annual pass
---
I’m only mad at hard scopers when there’s 2-3 of them.
---
I can agree with that, I'm not really a fan of any wall hack abilities existing
---
mmm yus lard of wolves mmmm yus mmmm
---
The trade off is that once you're out that's it.
---
Oh, I see. Well, if you ever get one prime you should check it out.
---
:)
---
thanks
---
Is there an .stl for this?
---
What? How?!
---
I try to tell my friends that in any PvP game so they dont get so upset. Take a step back, think about how they did better, appreciate and learn from it, move on. 
---
How it normally goes, "F****** BULLS***"
---
Should've added "must be steam level 100"
---
What.  Is.  THAT!!!!!!
---
holy fuck dude
---
Everytime I look at it I just laugh 😂
---
That's disgusting. Good shot!
---
Didn't play the first game as it was commonly on console. Picked it up because it was free on the blizzard launcher and bought it shortly thereafter.
---
The game is gorgeous and the story is quite entertaining. Great voice acting. I went and found a youtube video covering the lore of the first game to kinda catch up. But I don't know it's 100% needed.
---
Yes
---
When the g-fuel kicks in.

Go by Nathan!

According to PSN you need 101 GB free on the hard drive. However currently the game is 86GB i think.

Bungie has been very clear that all battle net purchases and progress transfer to steam.

Yes, quite a few random disconnects or loading screens that never end.

My bad, I must've missed the "energy shotgun" part of your comment
---
outbreak perfected is  a exotic pulse, look it up on youtube for a tutorial it isnt that hard
---
imperial decree is a shotgun from menagerie just look up a loot table
---
recluse and mountaintop are pvp
---
loaded question is vanguard pinnacle
---
Quite the contrary for me, I hate when I’m lighting up a dude close range with an auto rifle and they somehow just pull their sniper out and one shot me through all the stagger
---
My most recent one was shards with enhanced rocket loader
---
Im gonna pretend you didn't just call the Tatara Bad.

Straight up motw dude submit it, and ask them if I can have my emblem while you're at it, 😭
---
I only came back to Destiny recently, you'll have to explain: what's MOTW?
---
Bravo. That last tip is very underrated.
---
When I first got Outbreak I immediately took it into the crucible and got torn up because I had no idea how the gun felt, how it recoiled, nothin. The gun has such low recoil I was actually moving all my shots off target, being used to more erratic pulses that I like to use. Backed out, ran a strike and Gambit match, came back in, felt a million times better because I at least knew how the gun felt on my controller.
---
I lot of people did.  Speaking, for a friend, of course.  Anyways...

Is Buk becoming a meme format? I'm very down for that.

Movie of the week as featured in this week at bungie

Good bot
---
Looks like a rap album cover
---
try getting to max light 750. as other comments suggest hunt for powerful drops from milestones and challenges. Prime engrams and exotics. try the menagerie its fun. once you hit 750 go after the raids and LFG and the shattered throne dungeon. you can do the old raids just for the fun of it. but powerfull drops are from the new raids. good luck guardian
---
Meanwhile i actually have 0 banners cuz the amount of times i go to the dreaming city are the same as the amount of exotics im missing on my warlock
---

Hi this is red team and welcome to jackass

That happaned to me with a shotgun.

I mean, his very first interaction after being ressed was talking to his ghost which was covered in gore from killing a bandit driving a mech by flying through their head.
---
First impressions.
---
Wich u think is the Perfect Roll ?
---
I'm pretty sure they  start at like 110, then 120 to 150 for each of the purchasable tributes, but I'm not entirely sure if the scale speeds up
---
Yep, just look up some info on cross save.
---
Idk about perfect but mine has multikill clip and it hits like a truck in pve
---
On PC use "OBS Studio" (free and open source) and you have replay buffer to safe the last X minutes of gameplay so you don't neet do record it all.
---
Well then I will get the breackneck im not lucky with rolls :D
---
Haha what class are you running? Titan hunter or lock?
---
Definitely, it's been my go to AR for a long time
---
Playing warlock :D
---
Destiny 2 PC lfg discord
---
The shotgunner pushes me around the corner... to balance they could do multiple things. They could add bullet punch when u get hit so its like the sniper or lower the range even more for 1 shots or make it where the only way to 1 shot is by headshotting so it takes actual aim.
---
It's great for killing adds but struggles a bit killing majors if you dont have any stacks of rampage
---
Got the tarrabah for bigger enemys I always use primary for normal adds
---
No matchmaking for nightfall and raids. 
---
You have to go outside the game to look for people. Shits straight up from the 90s

So all dedtiny2 baf jujus has identical stats and perks?

XD
---
Yeah even the ornament can't help it. It's my most used exotic. Even after the Nerf but I hate how it looks with almost every armor I have. Maybe when we get transmog I can find a way to make it work better as right now it's kinda meh. 
---
Biggest problem is it's mostly "cloth" and the cool armor for a hunter is mostly "metal". So it never meshes well with the armor I want to wear.

Have you tried reaching out? They're probably just embarrassed.
---
ONE OF US. ONE OF US.
---
To this day it's still my favorite exotic. I'd love to have it back as an exotic/quest when new light/ shadow keep drops but  Assault rifles are in a weird place right now and it would just feel gutted in D2
---
I believe 10am PST

Make sure you have your power settings set to high performance as well. Not sure the exact specs of the mobile 1050 but when I was running a 1050 in my build I was playing at like medium graphics at 144hz. Never really checked my FPS

I got a Snapshot, Slideshot, Rifled, Light Mag, Range MW, and it dropped with an Icarus Grip. Is that Curated or something? Because it’s insane and my RNG is garbage

I'm at 37% 8% and 3%, grinding mayham as much as possible before reset

Yes I did, it may have been an orb sorry I didn't notice. But why did I get down voted did say something so insulting that nobody could tell me what did I say.
---
Yes.

Increased damage, rate of fire and secretly increased reload speed.
---
Its a great gun with the titan or warlock, really fun getting kills with luna faction boots in a well it gets super fast kills

We have around 80 I think, but we all play with each other. There isn’t any cliques like you would get with a big clan. We try to avoid that situation

Go to the dude at the tower that decrypts prime engrams and buy his legendary engrams. They should drop at 380 light. (Master rahool? Not 100% on the spelling.)

It’s alright to be an asshole if you’re good!

TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE DAMAGE!

It’s a commonly known thing to be in mayhem. Why complain about it? It’s been 3 seasons and Bungie isn’t going to change it.

Are you on xbox?

On of the DtG mods hit me with it on a different sub once and I beamed. Lol. Silly I know but it was nice.c
---
I’m on xbox, and my clan just got deleted out of nowhere. If your clan allows people under 18, then I would happily join
---
I'm not sure why people are so angry about this? If something works well... Then use it. That's what PVP is all about. Killing other players. If you found something that kills players really well, why wouldn't you use it? Doesn't make sense to me.
---
Welcome Guardian
---
Unfortunately I’m on PS4 brother

Or can snipe with blast furnace

Or somehow clips you with a jotunn blast despite it passing by the primeval

Eyes up, Guardian
---
Nope.. On PS4
---
YYYYYEEEEEeeeet
---
Hey is your clan PS4?
---
My clan kind of died out
---
Absolutely, It's one of the best auto rifles in the game. I put a rampage spec mod on mine and it is a monster. I used it up until I got recluse, but definitely worth getting.

That's the great thing about destiny .....you are never to late to join the fun.

I love how you just sit there like “what just happened?”

Btw. Did You get the whole set with dlc-s?

Got 2v4 last night so I left comp and got the “oops you left early match” then I went into another comp game and got disconnected when flying there so I got a 30 min ban. I ain’t mad. You shouldn’t  be either

Ok, you allow under 18 people?

Stopped playing right before Forsaken. Just confused currently and wether I should just buy Forsaken or the annual pass.
---
Welcome to Destiny! Where strangers become your daily fireteam members for raids! Eventually, they become your friends online!
---
Ok, good luck!
---
Im going to start soon too!!! My boyfriend is having me play through D1 and then when i have the money for D2 we're doing that! Never too late to learn something new
---
Platform?
---
I'm very sorry to jump on the back of OP's big moment (no you're breathtaking OP) but I have been playing destiny since launch and since D2 never really had a clan to hang with.. Mostly a solo player. Dad guardian so I'm not on all the time, but from your comments you sounded welcoming (which is really nice for a change) if your clan doesn't have any requirements as such would you have a little old 720 warlock :D join as well... I'm UK if that makes any difference!
---
Imagine thinking mayhem matters. It’s a stupid party mode, calm your tits.
---
Ah right, Ps4
---
Guess 4 Items + Token-Buff isn‘t enough either, or?
---
From a pure DPS standpoint, SotR, even without tractor cannon, puts out more damage. But Wendigo is great as well.
---
Yup..I think the awoken
---
LF PC Clan (EU) preferred german.
---
Just got back into it. Currently 650. Interested in all endgame activities. Especially raid progress. Can play all classes if anything special spec is wanted.
---
Welcome t the Destiny community... hope to see you around. If you need help at any time feel free to HMU.
---
Welcome. Better late than never. What platform are you on?
---
Plus the new supers too. Like, D1 never had the issue because spectral/blade barrage/roaming slams/etc didn’t exist.
---
No. Banshee good guy. Best dude. Even gives enhancement Cores now.
---
gj
---
You may not be the best but im genuinely proud
---
D I N G !
---
I bought it in February. Welcome!
---
Enjoy the best heavy weapon that's in the kinetic slot.
---
Precisely
---
You can get a hundred a week now
---
He’s a Diamond Dog
---
But there isn't going to be a destiny 3. 
---
Bungie already admitted they didn't even want to make destiny 2, they want to expand on what they have, not rebuild it
---
Because I just started playing comp you fucktard
---
Playing with shards and spamming BB makes me feel like the fun police lmao.
---
Of course, my mistake 🤣
---
O7
---
Once I wiped the whole team by blindly spamming colony as soon as I entered the gate, it was the sweetest cheese I ever ate
---
🤣 Not quite yet, 400 - 500 more glory to go.
---
You can still get the year 1 vanguard gear if you go through the Osiris campaign and you already have the scout rifle, hand cannon, and auto rifle that came from the Osiris dlc. Other than that, I have no clue.
---
Damn dude send me an invite, I'm a 730 warlock and I'd love to teach you guys some raids. My psn is FadedAzurite
---
I got my second one on my fifth clear, I really wish I could lend my rng to some of the unlucky guardians out there.
---
As someone who used to always use an LFG for raids, I can’t urge enough that finding a clan that fits your play style makes this game just that much better. 
---
I’m not knocking LFG one bit, you can do anything and everything in the game with those and I still use it from time to time, but having an active clan really adds to the social aspect.
---
I flipping feel you.
---
Is that breakneck?
---
Yo you need another person?.... I’m 20 if that’s cool lol
---
I got a ghost using dawnlblade
---
I suppose you draw a level of happiness from being right, so go on.
---
But the fact that those scoreboards have been kept up could have to do with the mods not being super-strict or maybe because the people in those scoreboards were not depicted as utterly incompetent. Also, clan + handle are definitely unique. Do the math.
---
Anyone from that screen above and everyone they know will immediately recognise them and the display above is not actually doing them a favour. But hey, go on with your interpetation. To each his own. I felt this violated rule 3 and maybe you can now understand why I felt that way.
---
It’s never too late Guardian, now eyes up
---
Very nice montage, but the beginning made me feel like it was going to be some kind of comedic montage like the ones MPedits makes so it kinda threw me off but overall nice music and nice editing. I liked the transitions between gun plays and super plays, they kept me interested. Keep it up!
---
Fallen! On the Horizon!
---
If your on PC I’d be more than willing to help you out leveling up and getting some raids done eventually.
---
feel free to join! i’m okay with whatever :)
---
you redeemed the triumph?
---
What is a squeaker
---
I have Destiny 2 Forsaken (and all the stuff before) on PS4 but I have all content on pc. When Shadowkeep comes out do I have to buy shadow keep and year 2 pass all again on PS4 or when I cross save will the year 2 pass transfer as well
---
Same
---
Welcome, m8
---
Not to mention I just picked up my Mountaintop....finally.
---
Same dude, congrats
---
How do you get that shotgun? And the people who spam Truth in Gambit have a special place in hell waiting for them.
---
Glad to see a fellow guardian find their way to the light
---
What’re you on?
---
It’s never too late to join us. Just know you are never leaving.
---
Hive bring a sword!
---
I am recruiting for a decently active clan. We do a bit of everything. We are a chill group. 
---
PS4, tag is Rexypants
---
Nice job, I finished mine yesterday. Just need glory...
---
Perfect
---
😉
---
Unlike the guy above I finished the kills way before the medals, then was able to change my loadout and focus on the medals. At around 1% per game. It was a lot of gambit.
---
I only get disconnected if I stay logged in for about 6hrs straight.  It seems to be some kind of battle.net thing.
---
Nope. Those 2 are unclassified.
---
If you want a buddy to go through the campaign with hmu! I’m in the middle of leveling my Warlock
---
yup, usualy hunters mains swap X (jump) with R3 to retain the aim control while jumping, as a warlock main jumping is not so efective, id rather slideshot and crouch spam instead of floating around
---
It's never too late. Welcome to the family
---
Sniper good LoW bad
---
[The creator's website.](https://www.niris.tv/) The top right corner says which curse week it is in the Dreaming City. Note that it is the third week of the three week cycle, meaning you can get your third seed of light without having to raid, and you can do the Shattered Throne dungeon and Wish Ender quest.
---
thx
---
The braytech one I believe, hakke shader
---
Looks like every single quickplay match i queue into. So many shitters out there that have no business being in the crucible. 
---
Practice in rumble first so you’re more than just a liability in quickplay
---
I am on ps4, if you need help, just add me, its lefsler
---
I'm currently on Xbox but I'll be making the switch to PC in September once cross save is available so if you wanna join my clan it's 86kraken
---
Thanks brother, but I’m actually just here seeing if anyone needs help themselves
---
Maybe fix your auto off settings on your Xbox? Lol
---
I'm very sorry I didn't know it won't happen again.
---
I think it should lock on like any other rocket launcher. You have to ads and if you don't they just go randomly. It's just too easy and brainless to get doubles and triples.
---
Make sure you transfer your highest powered weapons from character to character. That alone should help you level up faster as far as power goes.
---
I have one with four paddles: right is jump, left bottom is slide/crouch and left top is sprinting because I hate pushing the joystick down to run. I don't really use right top I think I have it set to change weapons
---
Add my I'll help if u need it...    korps_sh_lung
---
Geez 63 down votes
---
Probably has something to do with Soltice event in 2 weeks
---
I'm average at best. I'm better than my friends anyways.
---
And we’ll know what happened to Cayde...
---
aah every one did this at least one. you havent played destiny if you didnt try
---
Step 1 Use thunderlord
---
Step 2 hoard heavy ammo
---
Step 3 ??????
---
Step 4 profit
---
So get a team or get over it. We see multiple posts daily about this shit it’s annoying.
---
Very true. Lose a battle to win the war
---
Well hopefully I All I have to download is the forsaken content when I get home
---
No worries, we're about to get a lot of new and old people coming in with the f2p steam release.
---
Join the 7th garrison
---
I would like to find a good active clan im a lvl 30 power level 305 sentinel titan Think this will be lost in the comments but hopefully not
---
Oh yeah forgot to mention his weird resets. Must be when he does all his smuggling
---
EtG covers pretty much every gun meme out there.
---
oh god stop
---
Me when I debate playing again
---
Thanks man 😁 One of the most satisfying feelings I've had playing Destiny, seeing that triumph pop up at the bottom of the screen.
---
I used around 70 banners on Ph2 CoS the other day, I genuinely have none left 😭
---
I just need the kills and I’m done
---
I'm on PS4 and have Rat King and Outbreak waiting w/ no one to run the quests with. If you have a 3rd and some time this weekend send me a dm.
---
Wide field of view? Ha, that's hilarious, what's next you guys have modern sensitivity options?
---
Not really, it’s still pvp and not everyone likes it, most don’t.
---
Most everyone else will still try it.
---
Its not really bad, its just no where near its prime, so yea, generally still viable
---
I am new to D2 and play on Xbox PST. I need a active clan to join, I have a week in in D2 and over 1000 hrs. In D1. I enjoy all activities and I like to get back into Destiny.
---
Ah that would be awesome! You in the US?
---
I was sitting here waiting for the gif to start.. i need some sleep
---
Middle tree is fun, but it's not "good".
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Thundercrash is laughably bad. A peregrine greaves shoulder charge does more damage than the thundercrash super.
---
Thundercrash should be doing celestial nighthawk damage considering the danger it puts you in, the fact that you're in the middle of whatever survived after your super is done, you're far away from your team and away from a possible revive if you die, and you can't contribute to extra DPS until you get back.
---
Skullfort to give back the ground pound is nice...until someone shoots the guy you're ground pounding and you lose it. So you just sit there useless until it comes back.
---
I say this as a 100% pure blooded titan main. I love titans to death, the playstyle is so fun and I could never imagine maining anything else. But fucking hell I could write an essay about how underpowered titans are
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 14.
---
/r/Fireteams
---
They look way too dark. The light doesn´t even light up the one in the left. I would say that in this new race, those would stand around the power of a hive knight or a fallen captain. They look like wizards too.
---
LOL. Yeah dude, melting point is outdone by an empowering rift at this point.
---
He can’t even get up from his chair, his overwhelming THICC weighs him down
---
That’s how you’re choosing to rationalize an unhealthy behavior. This thread is proof that in the back of your mind you know it isn’t right. You’re seeking validation and approval for the situation.  It’s only a matter of time before she’s questioning who you work with, why are you late, who are you going out with, who do you go to lunch with etc. In your mind you think Destiny is the problem and quitting is the solution. But the real problem  that you fail to see is she’s jealous of you speaking to other people and even worries that you’re speaking to other women. This will permeate into other areas. Soon you’ll find her questioning other aspects of your life, especially the fact that you mentioned you work long hours. 
---
This isn’t meant to be rude. I’m just old enough to have seen and experienced this same behavior. It may start small but next thing you know you’re not allowed to go out and speak with your friends anymore. Go read up on healthy and unhealthy jealousy and see if it rings a bell.
---
Good luck
---
Banner shields for Heroic Flawless last week tho
---
I haven’t realized it either but I always run music soo
---
It's also super inconsistent. I've had it throw me off in the complete opposite direction of people. So it's definitely not a reliable one hit kill
---
Is the cheese patched for it? I know you can requeue until you get the dreaming city strike and then go to the blind well. Although it would still take hours, its better than the latter
---
I'm commenting because o.p is wanting people to snitch on so called cheaters. I never see the need to run and tell on someone.  Sorry if that upsets you dude
---
Moments of triumph is staying till shadow keep so you have a good while
---
How reckoning works is you are guaranteed an armor piece based on the mote you offer at the start. There are 3 tiers of mote, one for each tier of armor. There are four types of motes, one for each of the four armor sets. This means you can control what tier and what set an armor piece is from. However, besides the helmet bounties that give the lowest tier helmet you haven't gotten yet, what armor piece you get is random.
---
diNg diNg dinG dinG DING
---
"Worth" is subjective. It really depends what you care about as a player. The year 1 raids won't give powerful gear, but they do give items that are still useful.
---
I remember when they 1 shot in destiny 1. That shit was so much fun. No idea why they nerfed it I dont recall any complaints.
---
There’s an end date in August to complete the seal, so I understand though??
---
It leaves 3 weeks before shadowkeep I think 😩
---
My best one? Blade Barrage the entire team and then picking up 2 more kills before getting pulled 
---
My Hunter isn't even my main
---
Even so that’s still a month and a half
---
All forges
---
I’m already going through the first half of your post. We argued til 12am the other night because I’m out of town on work and I went to a bar and grille with a male coworker. She heard bar and flipped. She assumes I’m drinking and conversing with women if it’s a bar.
---
This is very helpful, thanks so much
---
I'm gonna go stand near it knowing I sure as hell forgot to grab more and hope someone else has one.
---
Raids are great if you like team play with comms on discord, otherwise no
---
You’ll love it!
---
I haven’t had the year 1 gear so I wouldn’t mind getting it. I want to get the bad juju and need some Claus armour so need to the raids so will have to do it - how long does the leviathan raid take roughly ?
---
SotP is a brilliant raid regardless of the weapons though
---
That..doesn't seem like a healthy relationship.
---
Ehh it's more Titans and Warlocks complaining about Hunters but nothing gets done but when either class get something actually decent (NOVA WARP) Hunter lose their shit and spam Bungie until it gets nerfed to the point it might as well be the pistol from when you first start
---
I have spent a solid 6-10 hours there
---
That's why I turned off messaging lol
---
Hey! Welcome to the community! If you need a clan just find us at "The Ace's Folly." I, as well as u/Chr0n041ph4 are the founders. We'd be happy to help you progress and get familiar with the game!
---
Yeah thats most likely tbh but like unsaid i think that it would be like super meh to introduce them on a hive dlc instead than on their on dlc i think
---
