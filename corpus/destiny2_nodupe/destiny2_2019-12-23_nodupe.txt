Okay. I didn‚Äôt know if it already posted.

I use the play dead emote whenever anyone shoots me.

It does not tell you to buy season 9 pass.
---

---
Its strictly for season 8 and in the future which might come back in season 10,11 or after all the seasons are done.

Riskrunner. Every time I know there's a single bit of Arc damage and a horde involved in something I automatically equip the thing. Works for me like a dream in Escalation Protocol and basically most PvE environments.
---
Just a little while ago I showed 2 NL players how the orb works in The Corrupted strike; you throw it at an ally to ‚Äúcharge‚Äù it and that allows you to take down the shields much faster; they thanked me (they were a group) and said how they hated that part the most and that they love learning little things that make the experience a little smoother, and just more enjoyable.
---
Unless you‚Äôd already beat the strike and just hadn‚Äôt claimed the bow, no you didn‚Äôt. The strike has been unavailable since S8 ended at reset on 12/10.
---
We‚Äôre in Season 9. That quest ended when Season 8 ended, almost two weeks ago.

The exact same thing happened to me
---
Did something (idk what) got lord of wolves catalyst
---
Then I did a match of crucible and got the black talon catalyst when the match finished.
---
This is incredible hahahahahahahaha
---
I was, yes. But i had to clear my quests. That could be his issue; there actually is a limit to how many quests/bounties you can carry at one time. That was why Erivik's token went to the mailbox. Once some quests are finished and turned in, see if he can pick up the token then.
---
That's cool can I get the link
---
no problem, good luck on the grind
---
What?! Thanks for the tip!
---
quieres?
---
The gun is really good lmao. Also like to take a price of Cayde with me after Forsaken
---
It‚Äôs not just you. It seems to be a widespread issue. I got it to work by just repeatedly loading into the Gulch area until it worked.
---
Did you farm the canal armor pieces?
---
I once saw a guy called Brota, Wingman of Oryx
---
Quick question. I'm not at home right to confirm but can I buy silver with money in my steam wallet in order to purchase the new season pass?
---
Titans have shoulder charge and warlocks have handheld super nova. Both require little to no skill. Maybe the throwing knife is sort of op when you get used to it.
---
Mystic rank.
---
The wording is odd. It doesn‚Äôt say fable, it says ‚Äúfabled‚Äù which implies finishing all of fable ranks.
---
Source: I‚Äôm currently at fable 2 and it hasn‚Äôt complete yet

Thanks

Sorry my bad it says heroic, even though I am well past heroic
---
Why use TTF when Truth exists
---
W0l
---
The nerf is only no 100% chance to refresh melee on a single crucible kill. It's still godly in pve
---
Same here, I got both on the day after season of dawn was released.
---
Dude. Best gift followed by the most Titan comment ever. I love this community.
---
No you can still get it. I never got the originally but I got a new version the other day.

There should be a white cloak in the collection under ‚Äúleveling‚Äù

I'm trying to complete the "redeployment" mission from Zavala, which requires me to complete the triumph "the best offense". I had already completed that triumph when I took that mission, but the game still says to complete it. So am I completely out of luck here, or is there a way to get it to register? 
---
Thank you in advance for any answer that might clear this up for me.
---
EDIT: I tried restarting the game, and it gave me the next quest step which is to claim the weapon reward from the mission.
---
All I‚Äôm saying is, make it just a bit harder to hit with, not hugely impossible, just so that someone like me who has no skill can‚Äôt kill 90% of people of the people they use it on.
---
Great, that would have been annoying
---
Thanksüëçüèª
---
What system are you on
---
LOL
---
No, I mean up, down, left, and right being all separate buttons and not one + shape or circle/gradient button

Literally doing it now at light 581, matching with others at 670 and lower. For the dawning essence.
---
Note to anyone wanting to do this drop your light lvl below 750, don't be a dick to new lights or alts trying to get it done. Use halloween mask and/or dreamers class item to lower your light.

Not so sure that‚Äôs servers

I'd love to be able to view crucible stats in game woth these monitors. That'd be ^^what ^^do ^^the ^^kids ^^say? litty
---
You are incomplete without sweet business firing away at your enemies for 2 minutes straight
---
Fuck you too, buddy.
---
Pinnacle once but you can still get drops armory and weapon drops. Easiest way to get pinnacle by far. Only takes an hour if you have a competent fireteam.
---
Pinnacle drops are once per week per character from the final chest only. 
---
The other chests frequently drop legendaries, including Premonition which is exclusive to the dungeon, especially with the Hymn popped, but they‚Äôll be at your LL.
---
Playing on console right now and it may actually replace my recluse. (As the recoil definitely applies to both) 
---
I don‚Äôt have a roll I love yet but all the same I‚Äôm enjoying it and it chews through enemies.
---
Edit, just got a new roll with about twice the stability and I feel like I‚Äôm using Bad Juju, no recoil.
---
Only made better by the fatality incurred by incredulously staring at the moronic fidget spinner.
---
Almost the same thing happened,l just alt-f4-ed instantly
---
Well that sucks
---
Not exactly valid since many viable weapons for raiding do require you to set aside time for. Whilst the raid gear isn't required, gearing up properly before does.
---
Yeah. Took us an hour and a half and that‚Äôs cause we were just trying to figure it out without looking to much up. That‚Äôs great, thanks a million!
---
Do a little prep then try for it.
---
that whole crayon eating thing is super real uh?
---
Yes, I'm sure.
---
One of those is the one from Zavala, where you had to do solar/melee dmg in strikes. I tried to check it out if it moves at all, but I'm not sure if it does not, or it's just really small progress out of the season.
---
Thx, I do have the Victorian silver hawk ornament for it but I personally dislike it
---
Nah, they weren‚Äôt jumping around
---
I guess Oryx is back? 
---
Because TAKEN out of context :)
---
I‚Äôm running one with full bore (i.e. lower stability) and I aim for the knee cap in the hopes I don‚Äôt land both shots so I can go for a finisher (on hive to get another breachlight). I can fairly reliably get both shots to land though not always precision.
---
Hmm guess I'll keep trying but yeah I find the recoil to be a bit much especially for a sidearm.
---
Oooo ok thx
---
This whole post is backstory and no theory. It‚Äôs a list and a question. What‚Äôs your theory about *how* this would happen?
---
It‚Äôs especially unlikely since the Sundial is confined to Mercury, and as seasonal content will likely need to be permanently gone at season‚Äôs end - just like it‚Äôs as if Ikora‚Äôs gate tech never existed.
---
I've had that issue, first turn off steam launching at startup, close steam, restart and see if it fixes
---
If steam doesn't run at startup, right click steam and run as admin
---
Basically a file for steam is stuck *somewhere* (probably appdata) that requires admin privilege, if you're having the same issue I had
---
There is lore of the vanguard discussing caydes will, since Uldren is not directly responsible for his death (the vanguard see it as Uldren manipulated by Riven, who in turn was ordered by Savathun) the vanguard talk about how impossible it would be to have a hive god as a vanguard.

what are you playing on? Im on pc and the playlist wont re match me and no loot at the end
---
I mean we're three idiots against this weird loot filled game. We make due. Our main goal is hitting legend. I'm going for it tonight. Christmas break so I can pull all nighters. I have a really good clan. And I really impressed them yesterday! Grew as a player. Hit 1k crucible kills with beloved in gambit. Pulled a clutch win to help a guy get his dredgen.
---
Some of my friends were playing some Quickplay and ended up fighting a six-stack with names like that. They were losing and one of them was like "Guys, we can't lose to these degenerates." They ended up turning it around. It wasn't a particularly stunning display or anything like that, but they were satisfied.
---
With new light, y1 no longer gives campaign rewards(no class sword, no guaranteed exotics)

Gonna point out that bungie nerfed wormhusk hard after a month and a half. And the oem took an entire year and about two months to actually receive a true nerf.

It would be a staple for me if it wasn‚Äôt in my Izanagi slot

They‚Äôre just too confined in shape and size. It‚Äôs a shame, i truly feel for you guys :/
---
What about them
---
As an anxious player, it took me a long time to even contemplate playing comp.

Today, I laugh in the face of danger and try to win with anything but meta weapons. It is very hard to know what or how it happens, one day you clutch and you‚Äôre good!

Sometimes I erroneously use my novabomb but in the middle of the deploy animation I realise it isn't needed or inappropriate for the situation so I try to move behind a wall or look down or something instinctively. And then I blow myself up because looking away does not cancel the bomb

Prob the worst quest I have ever seen tbh.  Actually any quest that has anything to do with Gambit is the worst desinged thing in this game. I am seeing a pattern here.

Can confirm, have experienced this

Forgot to add Warlock self res, oh well.

I really hope I got this right

I love running burning maul in crucible!

Yeah on PC it‚Äôs busted
---
Every Tuesday weekly recent along with the essence you get out of the chests.

Yes. F2P unless you want to buy cosmetics or optional things. I do recommend at least buying the forsaken DLC because it adds a lot to the game. Ive already played 230+ hours and im not done with half stuff to discover.
---
Ok thanks so much we were convinced it was bugged.
---
Not bugged afaik , you need to finish the forge with maximum temper active

We call them jandles here... So that works too.

I could have sworn they fixed it. Oh well, guess I will do it again

I came back to destiny just over a week ago after a three month break, i was in the same position as you, three characters at 750 light thinking what the hell do i do now, the game had changed so much it was pretty overwhelming. So this is how I'm prioritizing, shadowkeep will always be there, season of dawn will last until March, the dawning event lasts until January, I'm concentrating on the things that go away first, my characters are all around the 940 mark just through natural progression, you've got way more time than you think so just ease into it and try to enjoy it, good luck guardian.
---
Oh dang thanks for the tip i didnt know that actually

I beg to differ.

He has unique dialogue if you wear it in front of him

Yeah I‚Äôve heard that but like when you first save him in the past he‚Äôs probably confused. He has some funny dialogue.
---
I second this notion
---
Well you can only run one at a time... it‚Äôs the only one you need.
---
IKR? Honestly I love that our community is like this, that helping other people through tough stuff is a frequent occurrence.

I know it‚Äôs partially because of the nature of the game, and the audience it pulls in, but still. Keeping making it magical for the Kinderguardians, and never stop.
---
Yeah but it's not as fun.

Maybe I'm just burnt out tho, because I used it for most of d1 and then up until I got code of the commander

Randel the vandel on a candle
---
The only reason i feel like I still get enjoyment is the fact I'm going after titles, outside of that, there is literally no reason for me to play it. Grinding gambit for hours is the most unjoyable thing i do, and I get a since of accomplishment for like 2 seconds after I finish a triumph i need

Looking at the D1 armour sets (and the game in general), D1 is overly superior to D2. I hope the next season involves the timeline being broken and having D1 contents like quest, items, and even the raids being accessible for D2 players.
---
Fallen out ballin‚Äô?
---
its even worse on pc when its obvious your death was due to someone cheating thier ass off. like invader incoming was just announced and im automatically ones-hotted with terrain on all sides and not a damn person visible for miles
---
I guess we're the better minority.
---
1. i agree with bungie not adding certain exotics into D2, there are certain things that need to stay in D1, but there are DEFINITELY some exotics that id love to have in D2. Hawkmoon and Gjallahorn should NOT come to D2, but something like the Exotic Khvostov or No Land Beyond, or even Touch Of Malice would be cool to have in D2.
---
2. the problem with D1, having never played it, is that even though a clan could go back to the game every now and then, that would still mean that i would have to shill out a STUPID amount of money just to play a few raids every now and then. if the D1 Complete edition was a lot cheaper then maybe i would consider it, but the power grind along with the loot grind would be too much to bare with D2 getting the amount of content it does, i dont want to have to keep up with both games.
---
3 (Not in order but whatever) The perk / Skilltree system needs a massive overhaul, i think the way it was in D1 would suffice a system that would mold well with the way bungie is going with D2, being that they are adding more MMO-esk elements to the game. it would make personalizing builds a hell-of-a lot more fun than it is now.

not a fact obviously but a sandal is basically any piece of footwear that is mostly open and is held to the foot by straps or a thong. Flip flops are mostly an American thing to say as most other people call them sandals, slippers, thongs, or some other name.

In honestly surprised prison of elders didnt come back with Y2 at some point, since half of forsaken was based around it. Im pretty sure they completely went away from hard mode raids since they didnt want to have an "easy" mode, hence why the Y1 raids have hard mode, and none of the other ones do.

I honestly feel like they could bring crota back as a strike, just change the bridge section, and remove ir yut and crotas wipe mechanics.

if you are a new light player, you must progress the New Light quest until you get the quest string for the drifter. Do the quest string from the drifter, and after that, you will unlock the Malfeasance, Vanguard Loyalty, Reckoning, and Last Word quests.
---
Edit 1. You need to own Destiny 2: Forsaken in order to gain access to these quests. (at least the Malfeasance and Last Word Quests from my knowledge)

Its not a troll, its a representation of this subreddit.

People arent like that on pc trust me. Even the biggest dickbags cant really do anything to you unless you, that‚Äôs extremely rare. Most someone would do to you is maybe try to boot you offline, but that would only last like 10 minutes. Majority of gamers you meet wont know shit about hacking or even coding. Theyre just gamers like you and I. 
---
Always gotta remember it costs hackers money, time and resources to do stuff like that, not worth the time or the risk for some random person on the internet. You‚Äôd have to *really* piss someone off for them to ddos you, but like i said that shit only lasts like 5 minutes or you an reset your router or get a free vpn.

So me and one of my friends were screwing around on Nessus and he happened to stumble uppon a small opening underneath a branch of the giant tree next to the Imperial Barge in Watcher's Grave. Once you fall into the hole, you end up dropping underneath the map amd can see through the ground as well as a wonderful view of the copy paste structures, just like any other under the map bug. However, after screwing around some more, we eventually made our way through a couple of obstacles, and a couple invisible barrier traps, until I eventually got to a spot so far under the map that everything was just blank, greenish white fog. After screwing around even more, i eventually founf myself at the bottom of a huge staircase, and sitting right in front of me, is something that looks JUST LIKE THE TRAVELER. Texture, shape, even the markings and scratches on the shell. This could just be some random sphere chillin' under the map, or Bungie just pulling a Bungie, but in my opinion, it seems like a little more could be going on here. 
---
       So, considering all this talk about an all out attack on the Black Garden (which is on Nessus), and an epic final battle between the Light and the Darkness (Black Garden), My theory behind this is that the Traveler travels to Nessus in the midst of the battle to vanquish the Darkness, perhaps sacrificing itself for the greater good of the universe, stopping the Vex, and the darkness itself. Perheps in this battle, the Pyramid ships / Darkness RACE decides to show up to the party (for once in their lives) and join in on the fun. But that's just my theory. I'll let all the fantastic Lore / Grimoire people deal with connecting timelines, dates, locations, etc. and to just go more in depth in general. This is just my theory, so actual legitimate, certified theorists, go crazy.

 Taken on the bacon

I feel this on a spiritual level especially since I‚Äôm on ‚ÄúThat Part‚Äù on malfeasance
---
It's absolutely not a top tier weapon, it's just part of a quest atm. If it was top tier it would have seen use before this quest was added.
---
I literally never saw an arbalest in crucible before this Komodo quest, just because a lot of people are using it doesn't make it top tier.
---
Also arbalests are really easy to kill, use literally any other long range weapon, they all have faster ttk. I can't fucking wait to finish this quest and go back it using good guns.
---
Your post is literally about how every time you see an arbalest user they are at the bottom of the scoreboard. 
---
It's not a top tier gun.
---
well if you have the season of dawn stuff id say go after rhe martyrs maker grenade launcher its pretty good if you get a decent roll. the buzzard side arm takes about an hour to get its okay. pve its kinda what ever you want for super imo. the solar trees all got a buff so you could play around woth them for a bit see how they feel. go to xur get your new exotics from the fated ingram. could grind for the other ritual weapons from the vendors i just cant say how good they are. i just do my own thing really use the wepons that feel good i dont really pay attention to what others say are good as i then miss out on some perks i like on weapons that shouldnt really have them.
---
Meta is heavily void. There is a TON of new weapons. Recluse got fucked but theres the Calus Mini Tool and a couple others that didnt get nerfed. Each solar subclass was worked on and hunters are OP now. Avoid crucible unless you want to deal with Arbalest in every match. Crucible is FULL of snipers, campers, and fusion rifles (including the infamous Telesto).
---
The seasons take A LOT of grinding. They're new artifacts with each season that give perks so pay attention to those. 
---
My only tip is a good auto, a good scout or pulse, and a grenade launcher will be your friend. I dont Titan Main but Gunslinger made a comeback and so did the Warlock solar class in it's entirety. 
---
Keep your head low because we've got Christmas and birthday noobs hitting hard with snipers because they avoid combat like woman avoid touching them.
---
Top 5 tips:
---
Auto, Pulse, Grenade Launcher 
---
Solar Subclass to break you back in 
---
Keep head low and careful around corners 
---
Run the sundial like you ran menagerie (never stand still and be careful when you rush Champions, Barrier Champions, and Unbeatable Champions)
---
Sliding around corners is the best bet
---
Lastly, have fun dude. I'm loving this season and I hope you do too.

I've never tried to exploit the fact I'm a woman playing games, never buttered people up for in game coin, equipment or help, I just want to play the games I like but the amount of boys online who will make a fuss about "girl gamers" is just exhausting. 
---
Sure there are great guys who treat you as equals, just another gamer playing games, gender not mattering one way or another, I'm in a lovely clan where I'm the only woman but I'm just treated like one of the lads and I honestly love that about them and I wouldn't change my guys for the world. Sadly though there are guys who aren't so cool about things and interactions with them can range from anything between "get back in the kitchen lol" to "I'm in love with you" or "Can I have your address I want to send you presents". 
---
I've literally been cyber stalked in game before, thankfully I didn't have social media at the time so quitting the game in question, leaving the forums and changing my email address was enough to get rid of them in the end but honestly these days you can never be too careful which is a shame because I just wanna game with like minded people but personal experience/history has told me that more often then not it's just not worth the gamble.
---
I know it's not all men, as I say I play with a great group of men and I couldn't be happier but it's happened enough that it becomes really hard to put yourself out there.

Nope. Vigilance wings sights take up just as much room as redrixes I thought.

If you want a better pulse rifle, do the black armory pulse rifle stuff. Just complete the bounties and just forge a bunch of them each week looking for good rolls on their skills. The black armory pulse is blast furnace, and is still considered one of the best pulse rifles. Outlaw/feeding frenzy and rampage/kill clip are pretty damn amazing.

That is quite close, yes. When a friend of mine got anarchy on 2nd run, not even having any top-tier stuff for raids (like exotics, including class exotics, like spike GLs and stuff) and I cant get it even after 27 runs. he does not not even know how lucky he is

I normally don't pay too much attention to it considering I'm constantly going in and out of the bubble, and I play warlock so it's not like I can pan over the perk tree (and yes I know you can hover over buffs in the character screen, but it's not like I'm going to pause when shooting at a boss to check). There's no reason to be snippy, I acknowledged I didn't know it already
---
Depends on how you write and what the subject of conversation is really, I'll write things exactly the same way I would say them if I was verbally speaking to someone and that can easily be an indicator on who you are speaking to as males and female often differ in the sort of language and mannerisms they use when communicating.
---
As an example, everyone is talking about Saint-14 at the moment right? Well most guys would say how he's cool or awesome, stuff like that but for me it's not *"I love Saint he's so awesome"* it's ***"I love Saint so much, he's so adorable &lt;3!"***
---
Most guys don't go around calling other guys adorable so even just simple stuff like that can give you away without you going out of your way to bring it up :)

That's what he is saying, yes

LFG a team to do 950's or 980's.  You need to make sure you have the right equipment though.  Izanagi's Burden or Leviathan's Breath for Overload champions, unless you are running Divinity.  If someone in the fireteam can run Divinity it makes it much easier to deal with the barrier dudes, but even without you just need a good weapon with anit-barrier rounds on it (pulse rifle or scout rifle).  You have to work as a team to take down the barrier and overload champions quickly.  980s will give the higher score.

You too should adapt and learn to not assume stuff, i dont get frustrated by people using it, actually, it makes little to no difference to me since that helmet launched, i can count with my fingers how many times OEM fucked me up, its not a lot, what i dont like is warlocks getting mostly useless exotics over and over for pvp, while titans have the one of the best warlock previously exclusive ability (devour) for free and with any class they want, while still having MORE bonuses, like the free devour wasnt enough.
---
Damn you using arbalest
---
I remember when I was grinding for undying title. One of requirement was auto rifle kills in Vex Offensive. Equip SB, pick hunter reloading dodge, paragon mods and I basically never stopped firing

So that's what it looks like from the enemy perspective every time I hit one of them with my sparrow...

That's true but we didn't hit any wrong ones. We only do that for the RNG of forcing a second yellow bar to spawn. If anyone needs an elaboration on that, let me know and I'll be more than happy to explain.
---

---
Titans punch because... PUNCH!
---
No.
---
For raid, I wouldn‚Äôt prioritize sturm and mida tbh. They‚Äôre not great ad clear weapons and theyre definitely not DPS weapons. They‚Äôre fun, but I wouldn‚Äôt use them in a raid unless I knew what I was doing and am trying to spice it up
---
See my class schizophrenia is horrible nowadays. If warlock fashion was fixed and brought to d1 style, I'd go to full time maining warlock, especially since attunement of sky basically satisfies hunter mobility with the double dodge for me. But if they gave blink back to hunters (and the cloak of taniks)....oh boy. I would do dark and morally questionable things for those two things. *Like spend money in eververse*
---
Thankfully !! PvP on this game isn‚Äôt my best !! Just another challenge I want to complete though, done Whisper, Outbreak perfected &amp; Wish-ender this week too !! It‚Äôs been busy haha !!

I feel ya dude. As an Australian player pretty much every player is from another region and the ping is fucked

Well MIDA mini and multi are great for strikes and  crucible

spending money on games is moronic

I ran Will of the Thousands with two very new Blueberries this week. We had a lot of fun, and I ended up having to shoot where the access panels were because they were waiting for the doors to open. When we got to Xol, and two Izanagi‚Äôs shots turned a Worm God into nothing, they both stopped and stared.
---
Sometimes I remember why Destiny can be fun.
---
I heard that the louder you scream in your mic before punching them the less damage you take.
---
It just keeps getting better the longer you watch it
---
I don‚Äôt spend any extra on D2, I‚Äôm at 965
---
Same it has grazy aim assist in console. I have luna but still using it just cant find revoker kind snipe to pair it so went shotgun way which seems equal fun and deadly compo
---
I could hear this comment
---
Regardless of light level you‚Äôre still a blueberry to everyone in the game that‚Äôs not in your fireteam.
---
TBH not strike weapons. Scout rifles struggle in PvE still and using an exotic that utilizes no damage enhancing/ad clearing perks is close to a waste in a strike. Obviously strikes are so easy, you could run through it with blues only so I won‚Äôt say don‚Äôt use it, but it‚Äôs hardly great combo for strikes. I‚Äôd recommend sturm and drang over mida combo, just since charged sturm can kill majors and ultras somewhat easier then mida. Obviously, a primary and special weapon is ideal since a legendary special weapon will achieve major/ultra and even boss damage by its nature
---
I have a theory that while you're in the finisher animation, you're still subject to physics, but all it does is add up until the animation completes and you get yeeted into orbit.
---
This titan was having the same issue with shooting the access panels so my friend and I had to shoot all of them for him. But we loved this titan. Have us quite a few laughs
---
Headbutt an exploder shank. That's fun stuff!
---
Crucible handler on a railroad
---
Well the MIDA multi barely helps in a strike but them combined gives a boost of speed and with the MIDA minus ROF that really helps( especially if you have ophidian aspect with hand cannon loader on
---
Might try a pair of the Gunsmith boots from sotp. Or just throw on some good old fashion Ornamented boots.
---
If you have moderate Resilience and run Code of the Protector Sentinel, exploders just trigger the overshield and healing regardless of how much damage you actually do to them without killing you. It's free glimmer.
---
Why are people calling you a blueberry? I am quite confused.
---
The point of the video is that you want high handling and blast radius on a rocket launcher, and pyroclastic flow has lower handling and significantly lower blast radius than sleepless.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I will say that what makes pyroclastic flow different from other rocket launchers is that you can roll cluster bomb and ambitious assassin at the same time, whereas other rocket launchers have you sacrifice one perk for the other. Now that there isn't auto-reload with with rally barricade or lunafaction boots, ambitious assassin is really important.
---
On top of that, the intrinsic precision frame basically gives it tracking module for a free 5th perk. The OP also has masterwork blast radius, so this god roll probably does push it over the edge as being the better rocket launcher than sleepless.
---
# YES.
---
Posting without source? Traveler forsake you, guardian.
---
This is literally the level right before it I'd presume he has it already
---
Mida combo‚Äôs speed bonus is easily achieved. Utilizing lightweight frame weapons and (from what I remember) 50+ mobility, you‚Äôll reach the same speeds

There are two quest called The Invitation iirc. One ends with Legend of Acrius, other gives the chalice, you probably did the Acrius one as they have really similar beginnings. Talk to the both robots and pick up the other quest.

Hey man, I can't speak for the Hunters but as a Warlock, this... this is *not* da wei...

I‚Äôve restarted multiple times and switched games and it‚Äôs always like this for me.

¬øPero qu√© co√±o?

I know but can they still I haven‚Äôt got one in forever

Not sure if I'm getting whooshed or not but that's probably because it's Master Chief
---
no.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs my favorite rn where is it, I feel like it should be under neutral good though
---
One you need Forsaken, and two the box is no longer active in the cave.  You pick the quest up directly from Ada now.
---
I‚Äôve done this too and it‚Äôs dope as fuck
---
Finally, some good fucking food
---
If you have more content to do, like forsaken campaign or dawning missions if you have the seasons pass. But try and just complete some general quest and try and get your power lvl to 960 and your gonna be able to do a lot of fun activities, like nightfall, competitive and raids. Those are super fun. But now try and lvl your character
---
Better then complaining about it on reddit. Its not a big issue at all
---
Been playing a couple months, got legendary gloves last season with a 61 roll, highest I'd seen, masterworked them. New season pass just hands me gear for every slot with at least 64 each. FML.

You ain't shield skipping then. Also that shield is STILL a shield that can stop a Blade Barrage. The only hope for a Warlock to be saved from Golden Gun is to exhaust the super in pure dodge-blinking or Icarus Dodge. Otherwise, we die
---
I honestly just want the damage resistance that the other classes get during a super, since it‚Äôs sucks to be so weak in any super compared to a striker or arc staff or maul or spectral blades! And I do understand that dawn blade gets some resist but I‚Äôve been able to just shot gun them with a single round where that could never happen on the other roaming supers

No, only the expansions like Forsaken or Shadowkeep

The shield is super inconsistent as I've yet to block a barrage *and live* in crucible, excluding that one time in Gambit, and that's because I was right up close in that hunter's face. You also missed where I said *if we're hit by a golden gun, that's a stun* followed by us dying if they don't miss or that wasn't their last shot

---
I'll share mine. Don't touch the blue razz though, those are my favourite.
---
So I got Misfit and Ether Doctor at the same time.
---
It seems, at least visually, that Misfit is a modification of Ether Doctor, and both weapons are prototypes, judging by the permanant marker over the body.
---
Now I have Misfit as a masterwork with reload speed, taking under one second to reload. So I used Collections to compare specs.
---
Misfit has lower Impact, Ramge, and handling compared to Ether doctor, but those are offset by a higher magazine capacity and fire rate.
---
Visually they are similar, however Misfit seems to habe a bigger electronic module under the barrel and has some wiring coming from the receiver. The electronic optics on Misfit glow a different color compared to Ether Doctor.
---
When firing, they make the same sounds, but Misfit has visible tracers with an electric effect.
---
They both have similar optics options, although from experience I can say it's sometimes random what's available.
---
Both are very similar and so far they seem to be equal, until you get the magazine size upgrade for Misfit. 72 rounds seems like a lot coming from something that can emtpy 10 mags in one minute.
---
Nova Warp got nerfed because it was bloody broken when it first came out, its still a decent super on the tighter maps, I got my first and only Iron Banner Gold Medal with a Nova Warp Warlock in its current state.
---
Also currently every single super can be shutdown with a single sniper/arbalest shot to the head now which is pretty fair.
---
I‚Äôve never heard this quote. ‚òπÔ∏è

Titans are easy to smack because we don‚Äôt fight back against (or care about) the hate. The only thing I have to complain about is HHS but I think everyone hates that.
---
Sure you can, I'm just calling a spade a spade
---
Where do those exotic ornaments drops? The sundial?
---
how about , no?
---
No it doesn‚Äôt reset progress.
---
No. Your weapon will get transferred as is. Even the kill counter will keep its tally.
---
Uh, no my brother literally just drew it. Maybe someone did something similar.
---
*casts Saint 14 shield*

Right Back at you buckaroo
---
Ah, a Marine!
---
Speaker in a Beaker
---
Or Beaker for the Speaker
---
there are hacks that do that, im afraid.
---
OEM is still really good (If not still the best Titan PvP exotic) tbh. Off topic but same thing with recluse. All the nerfs did was scare away the apes who needed them as crutches.
---
A handheld nova bomb is an ability that Warlocks have, and there‚Äôs these special abilities in Destiny called supers which powers up your character, referred to as ‚Äúguardians,‚Äù and usually gives them a powerful ability or weapon
---
Now i wanna see a couple of guardians pecking at the ground infront of him like pigeons while he talks to a pigeon in warlock armor.
---
Great drawing by the way!
---
If anyone needs a casual ps4 player let me know!! I don‚Äôt have any friends that play destiny
---
bpeaker for the seaker

Too

All gud I just happened to restart my Ganesh and try one of the least costing bounties and It worked
---
I found him EARLY this morning.  But thank you for making sure I knew!  It‚Äôs likely someone will see this comment and not have known.
---
No land beyond? Anyone?
---
Yep, also xur would never sell the damn thing. That was just a pain.
---
Yeah I guess. I know I don‚Äôt have the best internet but it hasn‚Äôt ever been this bad. Yeah you‚Äôre right I‚Äôm probably just on the bad end of the servers. Thanks I just had heard about a couple issues with the season stuff (for example the EDZ) and didn‚Äôt know if this had been an issues or something.
---
Lol that was something I didn‚Äôt think of. That‚Äôs funny though.
---
Me too. Like an avalanche of avalanches.
---
I legit thought you were trying to just mess with people. Nah, you got a point. Would you say Warlocks are bottom Tier for PvP because it's rare to really utilize the class ability and have a fun loadout without becoming a meta slave?
---
Nvm
---
how do people see this and upvote it
---
I restarted my game and it workwd
---
Yep it worked thanks
---
i‚Äôm calling the nine
---
I used bad omens, trust, and some random auto rifle.
---
Sweet, glad I could help.
---
It‚Äôs just that when servers are bad on top of bad internet it‚Äôs, let‚Äôs say, double the issues and connection problems which is quite noticeable
---
To be fair, for new lights theres nothing that tells them you can turn PEs heroic. None that im aware of anyway. But when youre new and playing cause its fun youre not gonna go and start researching stuff, thatd become overwhelming very fast.
---
Didn‚Äôt say that, nor am I thinking it. 
---
Personally, I thought it was good. But the point myself and others are trying to make is that it‚Äôs been posted already, as have a ton of the other memes going around. That‚Äôs fine and dandy that he doesn‚Äôt read Reddit and cane up with it on his own. Point is, someone else already did it and posted it. After that, reposts just clog up the feed.
---
Dude... ‚Äúon their own‚Äù. Maybe not be a simpleton and judge things on different angles?
---
yes, going into orbit and starting over, and also simply loading the mission again
---
no matter what i do whenever i get to this point this happens
---
I main a Titan. Titan strong, Titan punch.
---
If Bungo adds red death back, they should have Red Spectre as a quest weapon(like Rose)
---
Whatever train that's heading straight to him you can guarantee that anyone in board won't survive the collision.
---
This definitely made me lol. Upvote issued
---
4 STACK META WHORES is the best way to describe them
---
With the Catalyst it hits very hard too. Go Titan and combo it with Stronghold for full on memes.
---
... dying?
---
I have over 25,000 kills on my Sunshot but that has been my main hand cannon since CoO and it‚Äôs mostly pve kills

Honestly I've been a little afraid to start raiding since I came back, haven't done one yet. But I have the first few steps for Izanagi's complete already (although I had no idea that's what the box was for and have been sleeping on continuing it) so that's good to know before I try to join a group.
---
I see you must be  g a y
---
Damn you cabal
---
Dumb Titans, eating crayons like a bunch of apes.
---
*Takes a long huff of paint to keep floating*
---
Ah that's what Papa Warlock needed.
---
Can someone expain me this ;-;
---
Everyone here: ‚ÄútIdDy bAd‚Äù

*What they do not realise is that that makes them* **g a y**
---
Python and 21% aren't Gambit weapons, it means ones that drop from gambit
---
You clutched that so hard that you gave shaxx a stroke at the end
---
He's a big guy. That and would you want to tell him otherwise? After seeing what he did post leaving the forest. I'm gonna accept being 'small' to him.
---
I heard he finally sold it *after* they nerfed it. But I had already quit so I can't say that's true or not.

Well I must say I changed class and spent over 100 hours trying to get that fucking "amazing helmet" and still haven't got it all my quests are now on this cunt I wanna play some fucking warlock
---
Do the owoken queen responding to this in the same format
---
there was a taken armor set in D1.  one of my faves
---
The Postmasters really don‚Äôt get as much attention as they deserve
---
It‚Äôs a play on the jokes about the marine core being really strong, but also really dumb.
---
I mean you do realize it‚Äôs possible for people to find humor in things you don‚Äôt?
---
This is the way.
---
Thank you for correcting my dyslecsia.
---
-she then punches her sister and eats 5 crayons at a time. 
---
Merry Christmas y‚Äôall! See you out there! Let‚Äôs kill some aliens together this holiday season!
---
Yeah! Wipe those smiles off your face! None of that V ‚Äúfun‚Äù shit ‚Äòround here you maggots!
---
But why 64 crayons?
---
Was trying to be funny.
---
Oh well. I‚Äôll just have to wait for stuff to die down a bit.
---
Yup. My main aesthetic. Scored Baron robes.
---
Because it‚Äôs well deserved. Titans are given training wheels as opposed to the other classes. Spoiler alert: I play Titan.
---
Because the playerbase is majority Hunter who eat this shit up like they portray Titans eating crayons. Seems like an expression of frustration to dying to "low kill" Titans with shoulder charge/OEM. Had hoped it would die off after the OEM nerf, but they rely too much on the symbology.
---
There's no constructive commentary to make on it. Eventually you stop coming to this subreddit for discussion, just medium to low effort memes/karma farming.
