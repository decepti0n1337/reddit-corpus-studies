Yeah if you have at least one other person with you. The set up I used was anything in the first slot, Recluse in the second and SotR in the heavy. Technically the barricade or Luna well isn‚Äôt needed but it does help a lot even though xol has like no health so the DPS phase is short
---
---
---
How is it an Easter egg
---
Got skyburners oat upon loading into a raid, i swear there are a plethora of underused weapons it‚Äôs awesome.
---
Nice
---
Alright, thanks your help
---
&gt; hand cannon recoil fix
---

---
What was wrong with hand cannons? I've played this game for a couple weeks but I really like them, are they getting buffed.
---
No problem. Good luck guardian
---
Dude! Destiny 2 challenge coins!!! Count me in!
---
Even the strike had some wild things going on. Turning guardians into fucking crystals to power the hive. Wtf I wanna know more.
---
Nah but fr what‚Äôs up with the hunters and have 30 eyes on a mask. It‚Äôs overplayed at this point.
---
Unpopular opinion but i really like play support warlock in destiny. I liked well and lumina
---
What i read in bl sub it has tons of glitches and crashing clad i went mhw: iceborne and wait to see how its working
---
hahah old chum, this was indeed comedic. i will now transfer you some internet points
---
Someone explain this to me. It appears they just ran out of time.
---
Bungie is great at giving a familiar location a new look. The plaugelands on earth is the best example.
---
‚ÄúThis......is the Noisy Cricket.‚Äù
---
Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking when I stepped on the platform.
---
You get the rare bounties from the daily ada bounties so you can do 5 per char per day.
---
Looks like when you find your ship in the first mission of D1
---
29/30 bullets, "i have to reload NOW"

Just keep telling yourself its all about the motion of the ocean
---
Wha-

As I watched it: waffle...man...dude....bro!!!
---
Painting for sure, bone ornament.
---
Not until Oct 1 on steam
---
Why two shotguns?
---
What is this for?
---
Amazing. I have a Thorn but that would look amazing on the wall of my ‚Äústudy‚Äù
---
This... warrants investigation...
---
yeah, nessus is known for that. I've personally found quite a few. ex: the hole in the ground at xurs old tree, and a hold in the Exodus black itself to get to the strike loading zone, while in patrol.
---
I don't know.. titans and warlocks are always trashing hunters. lol #stophunterabuse
---
I have not seen anyone say it is a hidden perk
---
It could find its way to your wall ;)
---
Full Bore, Ricochet and Slideshot are all amazing for spare rations. This is an above average roll IMO.
---
How does the nerf affect last word? Because I dont think a range nerf was necessary for it. You cant challenge anything at much range with it
---
What shader is in your Trust? Been after that shiny silver look for a while.
---
Legit I just started playing after a year break. Wouldn't know.
---
Great now The Number not going to be as good anymore
---
I just lost a mote. I was doing Tier 3, we lost on the bridge, I go back: no mote.
---
I believe I read in TWAB that they were implementing a patch next reset to fix an issue with cross save for some reason....may want to read it...at the bottom.

I need to use it a bit more cause o haven't seen the highlight perk yet
---
I like when he asks me if I woke up pissed or something.   Yes, I always do.
---
I am pissed because I woke up.
---
Hold up brother. You don‚Äôt have to log in to the account you sent it too. Just go to the message you sent and you can save the picture like that, easily. Also the game won‚Äôt suspend if you go straight to messages and just send the screenshot like that. 
---
I‚Äôve actually never had the game suspend so I‚Äôm not sure what extra step you do, to cause all that.
---
I don't think you can do precision damage with a fusion rifle (yellow numbers from tether don't count apparently) but I wonder if a linear fusion rifle would work for that.
---
Linears have their own bounty. Which is a shame
---
Poo. That figures. I've never bothered with his bounties so I didn't know.
---
I know! Like give me the frickin geomag stabilizers!
---
Congrats, but pre nerf was a reallllllll bitch. Took me a a little over a whole season and caused a lot of hair loss.
---
I can only imagine
---
And then...
---
What did it do again?
---
There is a moon level and I was watching a streamer and they all said oh look it's Destiny. Made me very happy.
---
I might get crucified for this but scouts don‚Äôt need a buff. You can farm people with a scout if you do what you‚Äôre supposed to with them. If you buff them they‚Äôll be too strong. Same with autos. They‚Äôre competitive if you aim. If you buff them they‚Äôll be too powerful.
---
The only thing I‚Äôve seen roll over between weeks is Ikora‚Äôs weekly powerful...  quests in your pursuits tab have a cap at the past season‚Äôs max light (based on when it was completed...
---
RIP
---
That was fucking awesome
---
Same,  stated with the D1 beta,  been addicted since lol
---
Lol nah. There are some who like challenges, but there are far more who see raids as nothing more than a "how to speed run cheese to bag exotic"
---
It feels like that for a hot minute, my guy
---
I wish xur sold liars habshake I need it so badly, but sadly he can‚Äôt sell it
---
Oh fuck, all this time with loaded question at my side and NOT ONCE did I even think to equip it when a well/lunafaction was nearby DOH!
---
Can I buy one?
---
Skull still generates so much power for little hits and blade barrage you could generate 7 orbs and getting almost nothing
---
Why do i feel like it is my duty to r/woooosh you? 
---
But still, that's a valid point.
---
Same with citadel and convergence. It‚Äôs almost like control shouldn‚Äôt have all three points on an axis üôÑ
---
I‚Äôll mark it then!
---
He cant sell it YET, next season looks good, Guardian
---
Ty...
---
Wait, they nerfed the sleeper? I just finished the grind this morning!?
---
You can use Crown of Tempests for adclear with Chaos Reach
---
What is this app? I need this
---
gearbox bad.
---
Hammerhead is the best looking gun in the game
---
Riven of a thousand woofs
---
I wish I was grinding more to see this gun sooner and not let him die....
---
u/nwordcountbot u/The_Price_of_a_Mile

Thank you for the request, comrade.
---
the_price_of_a_mile has not said the N-word yet.
---
He was on erris‚Äô raid team to fight crota and they wiped on deathsinger
---
Idk why this helmet exist tbh.
---
I've definitely dodged bullets in this case. I've had people message me telling me that they will get my account to fabled or legend for me by playing on my account for a price. I have told them no because I want to be able to grind for it and the weapons that come with it so I can feel pride and accomplishment in achieving such a task. They have tried to guilt trip me into doing it before and met the same answer. I was told later on by others that the same people who tried to get money off me scammed them for their money and their loot. Guys, do not under any circumstances give away your account information. I understand the desperation to get your hands on the pinnacle weapons, like Luna's Howl and Recluse, but losing everything as well as money are not worth it. If you feel the need to pay people for help, pay to have them help you get there by playing with you. There are people on YouTube and Twitch who do comp carries for free, so you can check them out too. Don't risk so much just to get that one pinnacle weapon you really want because it's just not worth it
---
Pls, obviously both BL3 and D2 are Doom clones.
---
This should be an achievement for Dredgen title
---
I think there is a way ro turn that off.
---
I actually remember the Cabal brothers from the Dreadnought more than the Valus on Mars.
---
*"Oh, the brothers are here. Take em out Guardian!"*

Amen

Pfft weak.

There's also a flying ghost looking enemy named dinklebot on the astroid lazer place
---
Yea, the hunter, but not shadowshot
---
nice gg lots of fun overusing op weapons and triggering everyone
---
Ye I could never get into borderlands because of how shooting felt. The shooting in d2 has really spoilt me
---
Exactly. Sometimes you are against a team that shuts down Invaders really well. You can't expect to get invasion kills every time. But at least you can put pressure and stall their progress while they hunt you down. That's so much better than let them coast into blocking your bank to high hell.
---
Ok thanks for the info satan
---
Sadly I was permantently banned from there, without even breaking the rules. Nothing is running in the background though.
---
balthasar gold exactly
---
and more customizations
---
It really all depends on how good are your shots.
---
You can massacre squads with a great Duke - even 2 tapping or 1 tapping with the right roll, but can you land those headshots before you get killed?
---
Spare Rations is obviously the second choice since its a 150, but again being a good shot and having the right rolls helps tremendously.
---
The reason Ace of Spades is still king is because of all the perks and rolls. Memento Mori and High Cal rounds which cause massive flinch. You're looking at 2 tapping people again, especially with the aim assist it is.
---
Remember, again gun can be used if you're a good shot, but having the right perks to assist definitely help as well.
---
Did you read the title? You all trying smart makes you sound dumb af. Please stop.
---
Destiny's gunplay has always felt like an evolution of Halo's. No other game has better shooting, imo
---
69 downvotes. Nice.
---
I would, but I missed the week xur sold it
---
Actually, bungie nerfed scouts (and all other primaries) precision damage greatly, making them deal much less damage
---
Yes it is good sir
---
The nerf to precision damage cancels it out. That damage nerf across the board is gonna leave guns that relied on pecision hits way less effective. The buff alongside that loss still doesnt quite cover the lost damage. In exchange this passively buffs body shots. And they actually buffs body damage on most weapons. Giving Recluse, a PvP gun even more of an PvE advantage because its perk works best on body shot dmg.
---
Oh I‚Äôm sorry, Colony helped me out tonsssssss.
---
It's because Anthem had a lot of potential. It looks great and the gameplay (movement/shooting/abilities) is decent. It just so happens that literally everything else about the game was done terribly. Honestly, if they had made it so you can get rewarding loot, there were more missions/general content, and it wasn't an awful buggy mess of a piece of software, it could have been a great game. 
---
They could have let it spend some more time in development and had a quality game on their hands, but I get the impression it was rushed out the door to try and be a quick response to Destiny and that's what killed it.
---
That could be a good pvp loadout, other than Delirium. For a power, try Play Of The Game or Hammerhead.
---
Cool
---
Prime vault. Some prime frames and weapons are not available at all times, only in temporary sequences when the *vault is open* check it for updates what's available atm. They rotate it. Worth to keep an eye on it, as sometimes there are some real rare strong weps/frames available for farming which you can sell after the vault is closed for good juicy plats.
---
Me: P-please xur, spare is warlocks... I can barely hold on...          Xur: √ßhr√∏m√§t√Øƒç fƒØrƒì
---
Borderlands 3 seems to be "reference: the game"
---
No
---
Midnight Coup, Jotunn, Swarm. This is the Loadout I use when I'm tired of Mountaintop, Recluse.
---
It is really big time investment to farm things as you are bound to rng. But absolutely everything is available in a way or another.
---
Sydicate was good but left us wanting more. It felt very AC2 Brotherhood but shorter.
---
Origins and Odyssey have seriously brought it back. Black Flag set a high standard and I think they are just now getting back to it. 
---
That said, no pre orders :)
---
Ah yes the daily bitching about anthem for no reason by the destiny community good to see
---
I have never preorder in my life
---
And now that ubisoft seems to.finally put the breaks on ac im getting into it.
---
I got ac3, black flag, and unity for free i bought the first one and thought it was ok i'm currently on the ezio collection and im loving it
---
As someone who did it pre fix, I'm glad no one else has to go through that hell. The weapon is so fun to use, but holy shit that grind was just... no. I'm not mad that other people are more fortunate than me, however it does make my accomplishment feel all that much more. I'm just glad that others are getting a chance to play it easier. 
---
I don't understand the feeling of needing to have someone else be afflicted by the same hardship and misery I put myself through. That to me is extreme gate keeping and it's a mentality that not only holds back games, but it holds back mankind as a whole. We should be happy our new friends will be able to do this stuff relatively easy. The more good weapons they have the less likely they will be left out of things simply because of a bad load out. 
---
We need to stop wishing this mutual pain and suffering on one another for foolish things like "I had to do a few extra hard things to get this weapon, so by god you have to suffer like I did or I'm going to throw a huge hissy fit." It's just illogical.
---
Apparently.
---
For a long time Crucible got under my skin until I realized it's essentially a game mode involving 4-6 people playing solo simultaneously--you really don't need coordination at all.  (This is all on the solo queue, mind you, which I imagine is your issue with Gambit.  When I'm playing with my clanmates or come across laid back communicators in the LFG it's a very different thing.)  Gambit requires at least a little coordination or else it's a total disaster.  When you're shouldering your end of the deal and there's some obvious glitch in the teamwork--a Reaper raining down motes that no one collects, an Invader hanging out by the gate before any motes have been collected, a Sentry breaking off to chase a high value target--then it gets a little more exasperating.  I try to focus on doing my job (and I'll take up a new job if it looks one of my teammates is intent on playing the same role), which is the only way I've found to come away feeling more or less contented.
---
they hate you for speaking the truth.
---
Doubt it. I‚Äôve heard of about 2-3k concurrent player during peak hours. That‚Äôs horrible for a AAA game that came out less than a year ago
---
When Borderlands 3 releases on PC I'll be sure to give it a try. I liked the first two.
---
Xur: "What was that? More chromatic fire?"
---
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills
---
I still remember the very first ‚Äògame play‚Äô trailer they released
---
Considering scouts can‚Äôt one shot most trash mobs as is, yes. I feel confident you might not be able to one shot any now, and stuff like cabal might take 3 headshots to kill, which is pathetic
---
Gunsmith‚Äôs closed due to AIDS
---
It‚Äôs fun to make fun of it though
---
 [https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48141](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48141)
---
But the trials gear isn't returning.... And it isn't getting turned into ornaments either
---
I get what ur saying about that it doesnt tie in together but for me it kinda does cuz i have the same feeling about pretty much getting "played" by bungie
---
Why? The quest stayed the same, it‚Äôs just the weapon changed. It‚Äôs still an amazing Gun today.
---
Haven‚Äôt heard anything more trilling in the universe since :(
---
They nerfed precision damage against red bars across the board by half. So scouts, which already can‚Äôt one shot most red bars, will be able to one shot even fewer red bars, and stuff like cabal might take 3 headshots to kill. We don‚Äôt know that yet but it was a significant nerf. Body shot damage is higher but hitting the body with a scout Is literally antithetical to the point of the weapon
---
Is Anthem really that bad?
---
Let me waste 50 glimmer at a time to eat ramen at cayde‚Äôs favorite ramen shop dammit!
---
They realized you have a really strong back and proceeded to not give you a team.
---
Um the first is correct the second is destiny and warframe currently and the third is anthem, it's got new content so people are dipping their toes again
---
Truth is objectively the worst rocket launcher in pve due to horseshoes, but the best in pvp. Arbalest's exotic traits are exclusively suited to pve. While you *can* use any weapon for anything, the are definitely weapons more suited to one or the other
---
Heh, that illusion that you will have MORE free time after high school is pretty endearing ;-)
---
Well were talking about scouts not his
---
Anyway, bungie has given exact numbers and percentages. You can find plenty of breakdowns on r/destinythegame
---
thats what we call tactical warning shots to guide the titurds into the perfect melee position 200IQ believe
---
Thank you for the explanation. I feel like you summarized my thoughts on the scout nerf succinctly enough that I don't need to comment on it. Honestly, my only interest in scouts is in PvP. I loved D1 scouts and pulses. They have effectively eliminated the use of scouts in D2. Why use a scout when Blast Furnace has better range and pretty much any Hand Cannon has better range AND impact (something I find myself utterly stupid).
---
You can link me a source?
---
cries while doing homework
---
They're weaponizing claptrap!
---
How is gearbox a legend when they tried milking popular genre's and failed miserably and fucked people over alot
---
Do we know when the latest TWAB buffs/nerds/changes will be applied? Getting excited for Crimson...
---
So the annual is free, but you still have to buy Forsaken which is $25.
---
And he would still find a way to be annoying!
---
Correct
---
And the one guy who tried a different approach fell off the map
---
My one friend always has to swap his gear to 9 mobility for the parkour areas, and I do the same area with 2-3 mobility üòÇ
---
Weel, I mean, we should have expected this. But whether we wanted it or not, we must immediately step into a war with the borderlands on Earth. So let''s get to taking out their companies one by one.
---
Yep. And I appreciate that a weapon can be powerful and unique without me needing to use my exotic slot.
---
Free the cores!

In about a week or two, Destiny 2: Forsaken-Complete Collection will get a reduced price and the annual pass will go free.

With the new voice actor? I will use him as artillery ammo.

I think Doom (2016) could do it, I never played Titanfall as I have never owned an Xbox. 
---
Doom 2016 has the best multiplayer FPS experience, it just sucks no one plays it.
---
U jus gonna ignore ma bois Wendigo, Loaded Question, Breakneck and 21 Delirium?!
---
At least you can get a team to raid been stuck trying to get into a Crown of Sorrows run  or Riven Cheese and either get ignored or kicked without being invited.
---
That me. Ugh.
---
Wait, I haven‚Äôt been to Titan in a while is there supposed to be a texture on the tower?
---
Bro im in ps4.
---
Are these real usage maps? Warframe has interesting clusters
---
But I'm still trying to beat gears 5 on insane 1st....do I gets a map
---
fuck.
---
Shhhh
---
For the most part, yeah. All things central to gameplay (weapons, frames, mods, etc) can be achieved though grinding. Everything else can be achieved though grinding valuable things and then trading other players for Platinum. That live person-to-person trading requirement is a deal breaker for some. Still, even then the game is fully playable at the free and antisocial tier.
---
This happened to me while playing the story on my hunter the other day, instead of getting an exotic from asher i got a blue scout rifle
---
Why are they clled
---
Yeah I got denied as well lol nice HTML coding
---
Then I don‚Äôt know
---
Ah. I see you‚Äôre a u/ of asdfmovie culture as well.
---
Borderlands is able to make much more interesting guns because they don‚Äôt have worry about balancing pvp.
---
Yes very active
---
I‚Äôm gonna need all the help painting lol
---
Do you play ps4?
---
It's very active and October 1st will bring a huge wave of players in with the shwdowkeep expansion/changes and the game going F2P for the base game and OG expansions
---
What is this destiny 3 you speak of? Last time someone said soemthing about D3 to bungie it was clear as day. There is no D3 on any type horizon or near future.
---
Either way, you will have to wait and see what their plans are for D2.
---
I think you're the one that's been wooshed.
---
Is deathsinger shuro? Or someone else? (It‚Äôs been a while since I played D2)
---
It‚Äôs definitely not late lol. I came back to the destiny franchise as a whole about 3 weeks ago since playing Destiny 1. I have two max level characters now and my warlock is more than half way. Leveling in destiny 2 is actually quite easy. It‚Äôs just some of the quests thatll take a lot of time if you do them solo.
---
When will the game be f2p
---
Pretty sure so is the guy you're replying to.
---
It's giving only year 1 stuff or unitl Forsaken i guess, can't give you opulence gear.
---
Hey as an artist and fellow destiny fan my offer is legit üòÇ I get a kick outta painting destiny shit üòÇ
---
Don't think anyone has picked up on the fact that you're also joking, but it gave me a chuckle.
---
Uhh no, sorry mate.
---
More options for coloring armor would be better. Preset colors only goes so far.
---
Poggers, I don't have one of those yet /s
---
Is it just me or is that bygones shooting wwaaayyy too fast
---
Does not mean that they should be sold as often as they are being sold now.
---
Sure it needs a nerf but I can't imagine thinking only pvp sweat lords have recluse lol
---
Skip that, learn to summon primevals already!
---
Its not free to play for 2 weeks
---
Congrats - I have it too and can appreciate the grind, especially all the Reckoning bits. Prime isn't always as bad as they say, and it's definitely better if you have full Notorious sets!
---
Eh, I was the opposite. I never had more free time than between the ages of 15-20. Right at the pinnacle of MMO gaming. I'm glad I "wasted" all that time. I still talk to people i made friends with during that period. 8-12 years later.
---
Wouah stylax solel
---
HUNTERS! Do not fall for this classic trickery. This Vuvuzela here is trying to lower your guard so he can punch your face into oblivion.
---
I never said it was funny, I‚Äôm just saying you don‚Äôt have to get extremely mad at someone who was making a joke, if you don‚Äôt like what he said then just leave it alone.
---
lol I feel like he did that on purpose
---
It's kinda annoying now because everyone is fighting for heavy ammo. But I finished up 3 recovs from 0 glory to mountaintop and recluse in less than 1 day each. It's definitely 3 or 4 times quicker. Just a bit annoying how many people are trying to get it.
---
Is borderlands 3 good? I wanna buy it but I‚Äôve never played a borderlands game.
---
I feel like this is directed towards an individual, who's saying this ? Also you alright bud ?
---
Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt raid much do ya?
---
When I saw that dodge I was like damn that was nice
---
Crimson catalyst drop, Amazingly timed with the TWAB saying it was gonna be buffed.
---
Nice username
---
Probably in the future, they will restart the event and you can finish it. But who knows
---
Name the price
---
Krispy
---
No problem, It's my pleasure! I'm just glad I can help out a fellow guardian. Best of luck to you!
---
Thinking about anthem makes me sad. It's a really good game, but just a lack of content. They could have released it about a year later it would have been amazing.
---
Soon my friend soon
---
:( we just wanna play together and let some of our newer friends experience everything for the first time
---
Uldren is undead
---
Rex is at it AGAIN look at this man go somebody stop him he is too good
---
Even before shadowkeep drops you can get to power 690 with litteraly no effort cuz drifter sells these bounties and when you complete them they drop a piece of blue gear that is 690 (there is one piece of gear per bountie and each bountie is a specific gear ex:helmet)and then you can complete all of your powerfull rewards and you would probably be 730 or more if you are lucky with drops. Btw you can do any raid you want with 730-735 light
---
I can't do it. I love bows and *really* want to love Hush but I just can't. Bows are precision weapons and this one wants to be you to be precise while also being unprecise and I hate it.
---
Some of them are...
---
Some of them are enslaved enhancement core
---
After we killed him tho
---
would you like to join mine?
---
They won‚Äôt restart the event.
---
We raid enough. I wasn‚Äôt into the Lairs a ton, and custody situation makes it hard to raid frequently with my son. Plus we do a lot of other stuff outside of this. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
I have all he raid exotics so that‚Äôs really the point lol.
---
In all fairness this was said in y1 and y1 Destiny was hot garbage.  Game got good when Forsaken dropped.
---
Your dumb

Hahah silly guy, you think that since you used and held the ace of spades, that you GET the ace of spades?
---
I was only able to get the long walk and the shitty sidearm. I would love the chance to get the rest

The main problem is that everyone is in gm3 and the new cataclysm. You won't find many people unless you do quick play on hard mode.

You can set any photo at all as your PSN avatar - I mean I use a baseball team logo as mine. It‚Äôs stupid easy. Doesn‚Äôt have to be an official thing.

Also I just noticed I can purchase Reddit coins. What do these coins do and have you bought or used any?

I mean wishender, rat king, sweetbusness, sunshot ect. aren't great either.

You're welcome! Haha no worries, It's all good.

 Some enemies don't have shields others do.

 Example: Hive wizards in gambit/gambit prime (when your primevil is up) are void shielded which is why you should use a void weapon when taking them down.

*Enemies with a colored aura around them are shielded.

Void= purple

Arc= blue

On a side note. I‚Äôm one fusion kill from finishing the quest. I‚Äôm at light 680. Should I boost light level higher or just unlock now and level up the gun?
---
What gamemode is this .-.

Thankfully I have the opposite problem. I am terrible at this game and can't kill anything to save my life, but I can jump with the best of em

Was it that bad in PvE?
---
I second this, really want to play but don‚Äôt know how or where to

Rat king is great? It does exactly what its meant to do and it does it very well
