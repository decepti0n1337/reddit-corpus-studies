That's cool and all but that's not really a real explanation. I'm looking for something in relation to balance in the Crucible
---
---
---
I‚Äôm talking about molecules around since they used emojis
---
I agree with you on delirium but with loaded question I think that it's pretty good because of its perk is just firefly where you don't have to get a headshot.
---
Go to your collections or something you can recreate it. Why wouldn't you just Google it?
---
Take everything you get from eververse and dismantle it. This way you have as much dust as possible before october
---
The fact he still got 22 kills. Still shows that he may be good but yet when against a team he may suffer on his play style, I was like that on D1. Was in a bunch of scrim teams but I was solo pushing and got kicked out of them all. So gg on the win, but never under estimate your opponent... idk what I‚Äôm saying GG on the win
---
F
---
See what you can achieve when we stop fighting amongst ourselves... We get tons of good content to bash through! More of this please!
---
Tried that, didn‚Äôt get any specific answers. I‚Äôve recreated the renewed (blue) version through collections and done the challenges but I can‚Äôt seem to upgrade just the vest alone. Wondering if it would require me to complete the challenges for all the pieces of armour again or not
---
Get some tegaderm from Walgreens and put it over it and then take it off in a week it skips the itching and healing process just make sure to clean it beforehand
---
Well apparently they‚Äôre supposed to be introducing actual phycological horror aspects and as a horror fanatic, I‚Äôm really hoping they pull it off.
---
with the cluster bombs and rivens curse it one shot the crystals, so it was the best way for me to take them out
---
Wait for a D3 tat
---
Because if it didnt one hit kill it would be unusable, because whoever you charged into would shotgun you, shoot melee you, or do anything else before your animation ended and you are able to do anything back. 
---

---
Its high risk and high reward.
---
Oh! Gotcha!
---
Yeah but we‚Äôll never get it back because risk runner exists. Just like we‚Äôll never have red death back because of that piece of shit crimson
---
Ill play tonight to confirm where
---
Doesn‚Äôt it need to be able to breathe?
---
Also.  Fighting lion is good with lunafaction.  If you know how to bank nades off of walls you can pretty much control any major lane.  Just gotta be careful about getting sniped.
---
So just ult from the start and clear them out real quick?
---
What rarity was it? You can get majestic stuff from the EAZ chests.
---
I'd say the only reason people are getting it is for mountain top. But if you get spike grenades or proximity grenades it's pretty decent.
---
Yes and no. With each bounty your synthesizer level will increase yes, but to recieve a tier 3 helmet, you will need to do *the same one* three weeks in a row.
---
Ohh damn that sounds amazing and nice to find another horror fanatic! I'm also looking forward to the raid, I'm planning to take part in the first raid run. Been preparing materials and my arsenal for it.
---
Skip
---
Maybe the Moon....
---
I believe the engrams from rahool can drop it? I‚Äôm not sure
---
Likely due to temporary connection issues or you're using it too early and from too far away. I mean, you're not trying to shoulder charge supers are you? lol
---
I'm a little confused about your question. Of course there are Titan mains.
---
Or just keep melee dodge over and over to clear because with wormhusk crown it'll heal you whenever you dodge
---
I believe 750. Forsaken and shadowkeep Locations will be free but the content isn't.  (Raid, dungeon, story mission etc.)
---
What do you use to make these. Is there a news template or something
---
Oh crap ya got me
---
Its not an addiction you know how hard it is to get an exotic to drop not to mention there are curated rolls bruh that alone is could amount to hours just to get a good roll
---
Titan!
---
I've got a chill group of friends I play with, if you'd like to play with us sometime you could shoot me a pm.
---
It‚Äôll come in handy! üòÇ
---
Thanks
---
What's hunter with Liars handshake good  for? I'm gonna  attempt the raid tonight and I have that, can you explain?
---
r/destiny2 was a fuckin mistake dawg
---
Get life
---
Emotes are pullable from Collections?  I don‚Äôt see a Emotes section.
---
When does it come out?
---
I still need to form a raid/fireteam. I got my new light friend tho
---
So.  I'll say a few things here.  
---
1. Meta is not the best thing for every map and game type.  Most builds out there have something for close quarters and something that can reach out and touch people. Meta builds are a two part community made choice.  Ease of use and actual utility. Keep in mind though. There is so much variation in weapon types that if you don't like one handcannon. There are 20 more to choose from.  Find one that fits your playstyle and roll with it.  Also.  Pinnacle rewards are tipping the scales in their weilders favor a bit, I will admit that but that brings me to my second point 
---
2. play.  Comp.   most of those who have Pinnacle comp weapons earned them. If quickplay is too sweaty for you and you have a slight desire to get better then you currently are.  Comp will help you with that.  Comp also has better game types and actually requires a bit more of small team tactics. And you play against people in your skill bracket (mostly). 
---
3. Make sure you are practicing or using a special weapon. You've got to be good with something that requires special ammo to compete in the meta.  
---
4. Find at least one other person to play with.  Just one.  That's all you need.  
---
5. What platform do you play on?
---
:^)
---
What the fuck are you even on about?
---
You. Didn't. Throw. Enough. Grenades!  
---
You should be throwing grenades as I say this.
---
Bro I literally smashed upvote because that is exactly my life
---
The issue is ammo not skill.
---
Im certain they meant cross-save
---
WHAT SHOULD I THROW MORE OF?
---
I am speechless. (yes that‚Äôs a reference to the guardian)
---
Get the helmet, do an EAZ run, get the rest of the set.
---
You finish the objectives on the helm then meditate at the statue of solstice and you get the rest
---
October 1st.
---
HAhaa
---
What do you mean?
---
DEAD LMAO
---
Pretty accurate
---
Yes.
---
Man, X√ªr must‚Äôve given you some good-ass spirit bloom
---
Mineral spirits taste better. Paint thinner has a funny after taste when I drink it through my OEM...
---
I felt that
---
r/UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG
---
Bugging your teammate to join you only to have him pass out, but you kinda knew he wouldn't make it so now you are obligated to carry him because you have morals or something... at least that *my* experience. And I feel guilty every single time... Also side note; I got someone Vex Mythoscast in D1 like that. He passed out near the end and we somehow carried him through. I didn't even knew he got it until he massaged me the following morning... I had not gotten the gun at this point though...
---
Because shoulder charging takes some amount of skill? You have to have a run up and then melee an opponent also don't know if you know this but there are ways to make a shoulder charge miss :) also Hunter with high jump and stompeez can very much exit your frame
---
Trusting a friend or reddit stranger pretty much to log in for you
---
YO THOSE REDRIXES
---
Wow that is one terribly written article
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôll be moving to :Xbox:‚Äù. Fixed that for you, you‚Äôre welcome. 
---
Congrats on the ink. Looks very well done and genuinely love the placement.
---
Yo, thats cool af. I have a ghost tattoo on my foot. The text is a fun idea i didnt think of
---
Never said it was the only overpowered one. Handheld supernova is just as bad but at least it's exclusive to one subclass. And you have to actually do something to activate the Hunter ability so...?
---
Found the spastic
---
Yeah
---
Put down the Devil's Datalattice
---
Do you have the original template for the meme?
---
I mean you‚Äôre playing as the easiest class with a as seen here completely easy method, so you should be fine
---
Except hunters are better at punching things than titans
---
Because reasons
---
Happy cake day!
---
Wow didn't realize it was going free and just bought the game yesterday smh
---
Btw I only mained hunter I was max level and had some good exotics but i felt it getting pretty old so wanted to start a new character but had no clue on what the other classes were about
---
"This is amazing!" - shaxx probably
---
Give the screebs some love guys
---
Thanks! The Crown of Sorrow gear looks surprisingly great with the Last Wish's Dreaming Spectrum shader.
---
How do you do a full auto lever gun?
---
THANK
---
Thank ver much
---
Same. My whole clan left, but i got even more irl friends joining now because of it going f2p.
---
No
---
Ohh right right.  So I can break them down for bright dust and then ‚Äòbuy‚Äô them back through this Emote inventory window?

Yeah, go to settings then go to graphics, brightness should be the only option on xbox
---
What about exploder shanks and fanatics?
---
Congrats on the mountaintop!
---
Model 1897 not Model 1887
---
The 1897 is a slam fire trench gun
---
Make them have a huge eye socket like foreskin
---
I would wager you'll find the other two classes very boring, then. I've mained hunter since D1 released and I have finally put decent time into my warlock and titan, but they're so boring to play. Your experience wont be identical but I wouldn't be surprised if it's similar.
---
Would probably make a better tramp stamp
---
I feel ya, I only did Last Wish once. Everybody left the game and all of the sudden they don‚Äôt have time to play.
---
It‚Äôs designation was the M1897 ‚ÄúTrench Gun‚Äù just for future reference in the US military
---
Tbh I'm not really excited to pay for Vanilla D1 content at full DLC price, either.
---
Like buying a 2014 model car with the guts of a 2020 model put in.

*Sad exploder shank noises*

This is incorrect.

Ok, I don't know much about Armor 2.0 but if power level will be upgradable, that's awesome!

Holy fuck I just let out a sigh of relief. I just started the questline smfh.

I BET THEY DIDN'T EXPECT *THAT*!

thanks for making me sad u/SUCKDATDICK554

What do you want people to do play what you do ? Play exactly like you do ? Just let people play the way they want. Quit making this all about d1 also leave it in the past if you played d1 you played d1 whoop whoop you played the game how you enjoy it leave it that way. :) stop being toxic

Spectral blades still terrify me

My work here is done...üôÇ

Lol go Raid Thugs! Y'all the best

Good thing cursed ogres aren‚Äôt a thing

Your Ghost also says that when you reconnect to the Light. It could either signify the start of something new, or gaining confidence amid a world of uncertainty.

Ask yourself, "did I throw all the grenades i could?"

Well, *did* you?

yeah defintely know that one

its nit that obviously, like normaly someone posting such a question did not you the searchbars.

i remeber seeing something better but thats the best i could find:
---
https://twitter.com/Djxyz0/status/1157354627630850049?s=19
---
i think i'll take you up on that offer
---
What is the reason
---
If you can make it a habit of aiming at head level more often (for example when watching a sightline or corner) that really helps. Eventually you will be consistently hitting them.
---
Oh yeah! Try Precursor Vex Chrome. I don‚Äôt know if it drops in the Best of Year One engrams or not. 
---
I‚Äôm with you though, I love White-Gold. I put Precursor Vex Chrome on my Opulent Scholar armor for warlocks. Looks beautiful.
---
Does this mwan that PvE is hyped up shit bit very tiny compared to the rough but gigantic place PvP took in all our hearts?All the blood sweat and tears,just to be overshadowed by playing against Bots,Timelimits and Wipemechanics
---
I read this with the Eris voice
---
Highkey tho Hunters suck donkey saccs.

That‚Äôs the video!! You have no idea how much I appreciate you finding it. I swear I searched micro mini sparrow shooting stars - destiny 2 sparrow shooting star montage. You name it. I tried it. But thank you so much!!

And who has a better voice than Nolan the broken? Rip dinklebot

Ivy you sound big mad for no reason, we all just avoid bad players and you're obviously one of them üòÖ
---
Yea I loved that it kind of had several meanings üòä
---
Well pvp wise yes all hunters they are too quick
---
This why you're block 1 for only a few hours
---
Its an upgrade
---
OP never said it was the first quote. Only that it was from the beginning of the game.
---
The grind was honestly so fun for me. So much so that I kinda wished we could have more than 3 characters. Maybe im weird
---
You can‚Äôt see it even in low cut shirts, just when I wear tank tops (which isn‚Äôt often)

when it started loading in i got sad then you went into the director and i was happy

I‚Äôm not worried about it though, I really like it üòä

But you couldn‚Äôt be on a fire team with people on consoles right?

farmers stay in pocket groups and keep to them selves the real cancer are people like you who get kicked for being toxic and then complain on reddit. also using emojis doesnt further your point just makes you look immature

Tell that to adi, zemi, spark, kymberly, dezert, slewdem, the list goes on. And i dont get kicked. I wouldnt be caught dead joining a farmer, i kick farmers kiddo. Keep crying.
---
Hi dad. Enjoy me shit talking these idiot farmers
---
I am.
---
Reckoning or menagerie.
---
*Dinklebot
---
Don't know about the price drop but pve events like forges, menagerie, reckoning and strikes (not nightfall strikes) do have matchmaking. For raids you will have to gather your own team as with nightfalls. I would say there is enough pve but I'm mainly pvp. Imo you should definitely give pvp a shot and try to get better for the fun of it. It's quite rewarding when you improve!
---
Totally crazy! Almost like they‚Äôre the same game developers or something... almost.
---
Minotaurs suck but this is pure gold. I ugly cackled. May RNG bless you for this
---
Wtf is Y1 and Y2 and why are we shortening it

That symbol looks a lot like a scanner from Half-Life 2.
---
This ace! Understated and nicely done.

I'm not waiting for f2p content. I'm thinking if base game and 2 expansions go f2p, Forsaken bundle will not be 60$. Or rather I'm hoping.
---
I thought Xur was the Cryptarch?

I might have to get this honestly. I have over 5000 hours on destiny 1 and almost 3000 on destiny 2.

That dude looked death in the face and spit on it
---
You can get exotics (some exotics are from content you need to buy) you can grind your light level unless that is maxed too, you can do the prophecies on Mercury, you can do escilation protocol, you can grind sleeper, you can get whisper (if you still want it it's kinda trash), you can get the worldline zero, you can get sleeper, finally you can get other quest exotics from the other planets (sturm, mida, and ray king). All of the exotics I listed are quest exotic look them up and you should find a guide.
---
how did you get those only doing pve
---
PvE or PvP? PvP supremacy or another sniper
---
I scrolled all the way down and was surprised that no one else mentioned it.
---
If you play exactly how the gun dictates to play it‚Äôs good (passive long game till you perk desperato then get aggressive and keep it up) if you like to play differently then no it‚Äôs better in pve way easier to use and proc the perk
---
Are FRs a problem rn? Or what's the deal here?

I've reset my valor twice this season and i've barely come across any.

Remember when the exotic drop rate was so high you got all your characters exotics in a week or two?

Do you have 40 or more branches and 4 or fewer tinctures?

All other grenades that can kill a full health guardian need the person to stand in it and are easily available and I find that most people probably don‚Äôt like it cause the name implies that the nova warp gets 2 supers

Or r/destiny Sherpa

it does affect mouse, just in a different way. on mouse, it makes your bullets "home in" on enemies, meaning you can shoot a little bit away from the target and it'll still hit.

---
Are we membering just D2 members? 
---
Because I'm currently membering Armsday from D1
---
If you like collecting everything, you‚Äôll have to play it. You‚Äôll earn xp and gear while playing. It‚Äôs generally pretty rough when you first get started in crucible. If you can stick with it and get good with a pulse rifle or hand cannon, it‚Äôll take you a long way
---
It depends! Sometimes, you just get an off night. Or you try to do all of them in one night, but realistically you get two done LOL.
---
Try 3500 comp sniping. (it's difrent)
---
no other shooter behave like d2 in pvp, so movement, positioning and weapon loadout has to be learned from the ground up. follow other players and see how they do, learn and get better
---
If I'm not using service revolver I use ace or the curated kindled orchid.  I like rose also here lately.
---
I want that kind of luck
---
Oh dang!  These are at Gamestop right?  I need to stop by and pick up one of these

if you like to collect stuff, youll have enough to do for the jext few months, depending on how far ago you left

Has anyone tried the PS4 Guided Beta? I‚Äôd love to join a guided game but understand that this system doesn‚Äôt work too well and everyone goes to LFG. Buuuut, the folks at LFG are...let‚Äôs just say, not always so welcoming to someone who‚Äôs never run something before...

I mean, that wasn‚Äôt a *no.*
---
Latency sure is fun these days...
---
They know the stomp works best
---
*bastards*
---
It‚Äôs just as OP as shoulder charge. Hunters don‚Äôt have a ton going for them in terms of close-range shutdowns, though.
---
I was invited to a clan out of the blue after coming back to Destiny 2 after not playing since CoO came out. My old clan was completely dead so I joined. They're all really nice but I can't ever bring myself to play with them because I'm so worried I'm gonna be the one to mess up every encounter.
---
I'll give it a go this evening an update with details.
---
Decryption can be heartbreaking.
---
Most people will teach you and usually if 4 out of 6 guardians know the raid it is very likely that you won't mess up anything
---
That's what I'm afraid. Although quest items and exotics should be held and maybe push out another item from the Postmaster. I'll tan another run and see how it goes.
---
Na Na Na Na na na.

True, each time you play you'll likely be placed on a different team, so the consistency will be different. I cannot control if people leave, but it would be nice if Comp allowed for anyone in queue to load in, rather than allowing for the match to continue as a 1v4.
---
On the PlayStation store, (if you use that) it costs ¬£12.99 for the annual pass, dk about other platforms

---
When I play on pc, it's usually only 45 seconds to a minute max, you probably should check your router settings or your net performance
---
Alright
---
Would that be to hit the more individual enemies possible or the most pieces of BB to actually hit enemies?
---
It's also quite enjoyable to beat a recluse at point blank with a bow lmao.
---
Lol missile is usually when I want to have fun, especially with synthoceps you basically get a mini-super with the damage buff from being surrounded. But I‚Äôve only ran striker Titan once, I main sunbreaker üî•‚òÑÔ∏è‚òÑÔ∏è‚òÑÔ∏è
---
Unless you wanna get stuff done before shadowkeep, why not wait New Light is released? Once it's out all new characters will instantly be 750 power.
---
I only play crucible but I typically play all 3 characters every day that I log in. Don‚Äôt get how people ignore entire classes. There‚Äôs so much variety to be had
---
*Chuckles in shaxx*
---
yes i want to see a love scene between caydes remains and ghauls massive ghuallet
---
I like how the hunters turns and looks at the crosshairs right as it changes, like are you kidding why would you do that?
---
Loved the video. Invader had to choose another move, he had to understand you saw him on radar. I would have bated you with a grenade and then destroy you ;)  
---
P.S : These comments like "you should have deposit your motes", god damned, people, that's so dumb. It's a funny video, not a pro gaming tournament.
---
To hit more individual targets. I believe it‚Äôs off each different enemy hit
---
thank you so much! is there a video out there i can watch on this to help me out? thank you for taking time to reply so well! :D
---
&gt; Can confirm you can pull it out
---
Only two places in the world where Shards are useful anymore after the nerf rape that it received. 
---
1. Blind Well - you can solo a Tier 3/4 with it.
---
2. Round 3 of regular Gambit. The winning team will be whichever team has more hunters using shards.
---
Gg.
---
Well ain‚Äôt that a surprise
---
I like Destiny a lot but if you are in it for PVP mainly I think you should wait until it is reworked. The constant heavy ammo and supers is really frustrating for me. Getting mapped by a LMG or being killed by the same super twice is dumb.
---
Whenever I use mine I only get half my super back at max,am I missing something?
---
google the vid...it is great.  something like "destiny 1 live action trailer".  I am at work and all vid is blocked, sorry.
---
Good move guardian !
---
Depending on the boon it‚Äôll either be a box that you have to open of shaders or it‚Äôll be an icon of three tokens which you will also have to redeem for more of that playlist token type. If your consumable inventory was full, check your postmaster. 
---
Additionally, the booms themselves cannot be used into you‚Äôre actually loaded into that activity. For example, Boon of the Crucible will not let you use it until you‚Äôve loaded into the match. Once you load in you‚Äôll have to enter the menu right away and use the boon.
---
Yes, that is what I‚Äôm saying
---
It would be the hardest raid yet! No flashy mechanics...he could literally have one heath and it would traumatize the community üòÇ
---
AWWWWWWWWWWW MAN
---
Nice
---
This can act like  a "stop staring so low" to the creepy guy checking you out, if you have a tank top on or taking a swim.
---
sick nasty bro! what are the shaders used?
---
And they nerfed dire skull. Lol
---
Thanks man! This is the EXACT answer I was looking for. I guess I‚Äôll get the annual pass Friday when I get paid
---
People are only doing it now cause of the temporary title. That‚Äôs why I was doing it. Although supposedly they are going to raise the drop rates of the guns, not sure it‚Äôs going to help though
---
Yeah idk then, cause i hit my crit, i had 3 shot on, i had celestial. Every time i have ran on my hunter my goldie has never one shot, it brings her to her final 10%ish. I had all 3 buffs from the knights.
---
But I don't like pulling out
---
Im convinced that there is a group of about 20 people who sit around and write "nerf" posts. These individuals post at such a high rate that it appears to be a community wide movement...when in reality its just a handful of incels.
---
I only had one character which is my titan. I got kind of tired of doing just weekly stuff and crucible so I decided to level up another character and I despise warlocks so hunter it was lol
---
But you think you're original?  Eat a snickers and chill out bro. Most of reddit are ppl being "attention whores or can be seen as such, even your post of that *very* basic Golden Gun short. 
---
Try being more positive and less judgemental man, it might do ya some good.
---
The problem is the random drops. Some games you see no heavy and the other team is swimming in it. That's basically an automatic loss.
---
Yeah lol I didn't realize it either
---
Very interesting, the raids have been really good and fun but the quests for exotics can be a bit of a drag at times.  Pretty much need a solid fireteam 3 or 6 peeps to help you out and you can get most of those things done fairly quickly.  They seem to be putting more emphasis on menial tasks for special stuff lately, so mostly will have to wait and see what they plan on doing with Shadowkeep.
---
Well, I guess you just know better than I do. Kinda strange considering the content of this post but I'm not complaining that you can do your own research.
---
Oh and fusion rifles definitely did not drop out of the meta.
---
That‚Äôs one loud ass ps4
---
My buddy that dropped it in year 1 D2 texted me a few weeks back asking how shadowkeep dlc would work. Unfortunately he didn‚Äôt like my answer and I‚Äôve returned to banging my head against a wall trying to solo shit
---
idk either, i'm gonna have to try it again next time i do it. i was gonna ask about the knight's buffs next but you beat me to it :)
---
Saw this advice online that might help:
---
‚ÄúHead to the Scourge of the Past raid and kill Fallen Captains at the beginning of it.‚Äù
---
Thank you. And happy cake day
---
THAT needs a range nerf hard
---
Mines chilling at 48
---
Does this mean you can do all the upgrading after the event, or just the jump to the top level?
---
Don‚Äôt be mean to him he‚Äôs just a really old exo I fell bad for him cause was one of his best friends
---
Oof
---
All players start at 750 light
---
how...why is this even an option!??!!???
---
yes
---
As long as you get the Legendary set before solstice ends, you can do the masterworking later. Only thing that might be important to note, is that one of the requirements to get the MMXIX title is masterworking one piece of solstice gear, and that has to be done by a certain date (08/27/19 I believe?)
---
Taken armanents ftw
---
This is what I need to know. I gotta level up my titan and warlock and really don't wanna bother with it
---
Just keeping going through the forsaken DLC he will make himself known soon enough
---
If you have taken armaments, or Fallen armaments you already have an advantage. You're pretty much guaranteed heavy as long as you kill a taken or fallen with a grenade. Those without these mods are heavily at a disadvantage if heavy were to go this route, just saying. something to think about
---
Your guess is as good as mine my man
---
You better cook up some supercharged light and *feed* it to that primeval
---
Yea, he's around Friday reset to Tuesday reset each week.
---
I might run it again later today, maybe help some people who need the mw on solstice armor, and ill check, but only if i have time to run it :)
---
I feel like as soon as i delete something, I am going to want it back when a weapon patch comes in :,(
---
Yes
---
Which forges do you have unlocked
---
Fuck my anxiety
---
Ni.ce
---
No way to farm as far as I am aware since it is RNG.  You can get the helmet from the weekly bounty, that is the only guaranteed one that I know off.
---
The only known stat that I am aware of is going in with a fireteam to farm.  Relying on blueberries is not the best route for this.
---
That looks quite stressful
---
They nerfed shards long before they nerfed skull and the rest of the super exotics. 
---
It just happens that they have a very broken interaction with mayhem rules where it provides practically instant super. That‚Äôs honestly the only thing that made them busted in the first place and it wasn‚Äôt changed at all when they were nerfed. 
---
So mayhem, normal gambit tiebreaker and blind well harmony buffs all make these things valuable. Everywhere else, they are generally worse than the rest of them even after nerfs.
---
I just haven't played since- what the hell is that next to the earth?!
---
I guess it sucks for gaining glory, but I remember multiple times I was glad it was clash / control due to being able to get my pinnacle quest kills
---
My favorite for like the first year was hawk moon (I know, everyone hates it, lol) but I finally got bad juju and just never put it back down
---
Haha! More effort like that and we might just win this.
---
^^^This one gets the shame.
---
Hey man, I thought it sounded good. Would be funny af.
---
It was found ages ago. Well done for finding it though.
---
o7
---
Totally, since destiny 1 I only used autorifles, same with D2 i have most of them (black armory and the new ones are missing because no anual pass T n T ) but out of nowhere everyone using the halfdan and stuff, feels bad tho
---
Shoot them with the appropriate element type, ie. Red=solar, Purple=void and Blue=arc. Getting all of them unlocks certain exotic sparrows and an exotic sword. Iirc.
---
I haven‚Äôt really grinded for the other pinnacle weapons but I can see why it might be helpful
---
Lfg
---
That one right there you have shoot with a javelin
---
That's funny. After watching that vid I gave halfdan another try. It bounces around so much, after one match I returned it to the vault and chalked it up to the differences between pc and console
---
it should not easily cross map me, it should be a threat at mid/close not sniper.  Unless you go bottom tree,  I will accept it from bottom because that is 3 shots max, and maybe make the range have some fall off.  But no sniping people with a regenerating "six shooter" is not balanced even if you have no armor buff.
---
Those snipes were crispy
---
No, there's never enough wells
---
It's just sex ketchup
---
Could model it after the M1216 shotgun from BO2 and have the mag twist to change ammo type and replace the entire mag when empty.
---
Oh sick
---
There are two different red types; the orangish ones need Solar damage and the redder ones need to be hit with the Valkyrie that spawns during certain public events.
---
Yes.there are quite a few videos about this on YouTube don‚Äôt know if it was a typo or something but it‚Äôs NOT guardian kills it‚Äôs any kills, load up the whisper mission on IO when you get to the oblong jump puzzle room ( the first one) drop through the cracks in the floor and you land in a room that has continually spawning shadow thrall, wait till solar day and let empowerment do its job. Enjoy!! If your on x box message me and I will help you I can also get you into our clan if you want.üòä

He makes a good douche as Captain Hammer in Dr. Horribles Singalong Blog too. Dudes just on point if given the chance to have a little fun.
---
Not sure about his new show, but I heard it wasn‚Äôt great.
---
This is awesome. :)
---
I might do in the future but I‚Äôm not too far of it now so I‚Äôll just try my look
---
There are 45 of these all around the planet.  Blue ones you have to shoot with an arc weapon, purple ones with void, ligher red with solar, and the deeper red with the javalin (only 3 are javalin).  Once you shoot 40 of them you can go to the lost sector in Braytech to pick up your worldline zero exotic sword.  If you get all 45 you can go to a cave in oplympic descent and get a sparrow.
---
Almost 7k views.. that's a mixed message for sure.
---
I‚Äôm assuming the one in the image is dark red?
---
Unless you plan on playing only PvP a shit ton between now and then and you are a God with GLs, I‚Äôd wait, for your sanity
---
That and being in overtime with increased supers.
---
You gotta physically pick them up off the ground m8, otherwise people would just take them out of collections
---
First time I heard him do this I lost it. The mans the heart and soul of the game.
---
Could probably get a few more down in raid, or pvp
---
I damn near spat tea out my nose.  
---
Take my bloodly upvote
---
Love the hunter one!! care if I use your tattoo idea I've been wanting to get a hunter inspired tat and that caught my eye
---
That's dope!
---
Apparently I have good rng and get a lot of curated weapons that I just scrap
---
I am rivensbane  so I must Sherpa everyone that asks me (based off several messages in LFG)
---
That people play matchmade modes like free for all and unless you're in a fireteam, worry about yourself. 
---
I spent most of year 1 helping and carrying ppl only to never see them do anything on their own. 
---
Since year 2, I've been a solo player and now I'm sitting at 84k triumph with 6 seals done.
---
bruh so I spent all that time farming 100 for them to make it 50 fml
---
Yeah tether makes the knights a lot easier but since whisper isn‚Äôt really an option anymore you might have to hold onto heavy ammo.
---
i mean mayhem is broken. its supposed to broken.
---
Go for it!! I‚Äôm glad you like it!
---
Looks amazing!
---
That‚Äôll never happen again
---
The chalice quest provides you with a full set of 690 gear
---
for what
---
I thought so too, but the only way the OP‚Äôs situation would happen is if the Xol kill counted elsewhere.
---

&gt; Go to Hawthorne every time you lvl up. You will be able to buy a higher light secondary and 3 armor pieces until to you reach 200 light.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Keep your highest light weapons for each lvl as you go. Just throw them in your vault for later. They will help you lvl up your alt characters quicker.
---
&gt; Someone else advised not to do your other characters at the same time, but that is not necessarily a good thing. If you do them together, you can swap the weapons as you go and get higher light quicker.
---
Realllllllly good to know, thanks so much!
---
Fuck I forgot I was working on this and need a reset when its double infamy üò≠
---
A person for whom English is clearly a second language is asking for a code for a Reckoner pin. Their friend would like it for their jacket.
---
A lot of D2 gamers don‚Äôt realize how good it feels for their soul, considering they play D2.
---
I noticed this the other day too. This was pretty effin great. Other than this though shards of galanor seems pretty and miss for me.
---
I think its awesome.
---
"Titans OP they need a Nerf"
---
Will this also apply for new characters?
---
xbox has a built-in lfg system, is that not working for you?
---
Does it require a full group? Or some crazy reauirement?
---
Yes in my experience Charlemagne is the most accurate.
---
Ok. Then it seems i do indeed have much work ahead of me. Im kinda trying to dethrone Crimson lol.
---
It doesn't do aoe to you?
---
My bologna has a first name.
---
I think so.
---
Have yall prepurchased the expansion?
---
Universal remote
---
What pisses me off is that bungie forces people who hates broken crucible to suffer it because solstice. Thanks bungie for killing all noice experience with your shitty crucible.
---
O O F
---
Looks Good! But I need the know...are you a titan?
---
yes, but you will lose any progress you had on that character if migrate your console account over
---
You could start streaming, if ur a girl, it‚Äôd be so easy for u to gain followers
---
I am bad at videogames, but my I have many raid clears with my raid friends, so they trust me and I trust them.  They know I am sometimes the worst destiny player, and they know sometimes I get shit done.  Is a completementary relation where everyone give their best.  While playing with stranger, sometimes theres like a wall of communication and trust that make things way less efficient and fun.  I don't raid anymore because my raid friends did not lilked Destiny 2 :(
---
I totally agree with you, it¬¥s not skillbased in any shape or form. But as long as Bungie doesn¬¥t change anything about it you have to fit in with the braindead meta and lfg shit
---
I play on console but if you press your left trigger, it‚Äôll tell you what they are. Usually its missions that still need to be completed. They‚Äôre usually ones that are more important than blue missions.
---
I pinged you for this comment and post on purpose, figured it's fitting
---
reepost
---
Is there any way i can get it to display to me trackers for every weapon?
---
You got lucky. My experience with the first raids was not being able to beat the whole raid for 2 or 3 weeks, until something clicked.
---
I mean.... You're not wrong.
---
I men if you don't wanna grind for exotics or solstice on it you might as well
---
"Okay but can you go for orbs *while* banking motes please?"
---
Yeah I agree, did my 2 reset infamy ranks in about 2 weeks and the Truth pretty much made the match a pain
---
‚ÄúLoading‚Äù
---
How expensive would a comma be to add?
---
If you want to level up super fast, just do the missions from the vendors on every world. I went from level 1 to 50 in 2 days. Seriously. They give tons of experience. Combine it with the fire team medallion and a ghost that gives bonus experience.
---
Beast
---
That doesn‚Äôt mean you did 70% of the bosses health just means you did 70 of your teams total which might not have been much. Plus you lost lol
---
Join up (the siva exterminators)
---
Wait till shadowkeep
---
Twas the 59.99  one.
---
Im never lucky with rng it took me 90 times to get the ikelos shotgun then as soon as I got it it got nurfed fml
---
I see that well rested
---
You got goomba stomped
---
Nice. I'd probably wimp out since I hate needles so much, but if I were to get a tat, I'd want it to be something like that. Nice and simple.
---
It matches you based on glory rank m8
---
Do you not see the arrow next to my name? Let‚Äôs look more carefully next time
---
Yeah that's the one I got
---
No, there are a couple or reputable carry/account recovery services out there. I doubt they would still be in business if Bungie was banning their clientele.
---
bungie won‚Äôt perma ban ‚Äúbot accounts‚Äù 2nd they are not bot accounts they at least on pc are people using third party macros to fool the idle system 3rd i belive it has been stated some somewhere in bungie forums accounts found doing this will be given temporary bans... so it‚Äôs there people afking activities like gambit and crucible for  example people do this to avoid the 10 gambit matches for solstice
---
And how did it just changed order like that
---
Yea, it took me a while to decide what I wanted since I like very clean cut looking designs but I‚Äôm happy I settled on this one (:
---
amethyst veil
---
lmaooo.
---
Right fuck this 100 bullshit
---
Killing a giant thicc boi on a fish spaceship
---
Shader?
---
The trench barrel perk was changed forever ago.
---
I hope the surprise is they delete PvP so I don't have to play it anymore for my solstice/exotic quests.
---
How do I get it?
---
I know I was living under a rock and grinding for it since then
---
Ok thanks
---
Eververse. You have to wait for Tess‚Äô inventory to cycle around until she sells it again.
---
PvP - Mk44 stand asides and Skullfort. Overshield while sprinting and ohk shoulder charge with instant recharge.   
---
  
---
PvE - Lunafactuons and Phoenix Protocol. No reload in well and super energy return for kills
---
that was the first thing I tried, unfortunately his toes were also immune
---
Bruh that sucks

I used to work at a local Micro Center type company in my city, building custom computers and I built some time ago, before ryzen 3000 came out, a Ryzen 5 2600, 16gb ram 3200, b450 MoBo and a gtx1060 system for around ‚Ç¨750 to a guy who specificaly said he only plays D2, War Thunder and Rainbow Six and said after a week that he always got over 90fps on max setting at 1080p.
---
Now that same system, after the launch of ryzen 3000 and the subsequently drop in prices on ryzen 2000 and 450/470 chipset motherboards, and pairin it with a gtx 1660ti instead of a gtx1060, I think you could get it for around the same price as the guy did almost a year ago, maybe for a bit more, like around ‚Ç¨50-100 more expensive because of the newer GPU, but it will run destiny, and almost whatever games you throw at it on very high/ultra  settings at 1080p with no problems on getting over 60fps.
---
Shit I wrote the wrong title I‚Äôm so tried I cannt even typee
---
I meant it was nerfed ages ago and my friends told me that day nm cbs to change
