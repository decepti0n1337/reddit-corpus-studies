dunno already at 3,5k and it never took more paints than it gives, and i lost a lot in that climb, Its easier to climb up now than before (berely made it to 1,9k solo) Bare in mind i didnt use the freelance option, even when going solo

If anything itll make them more money when people spend silver on ornaments to see how they look like with the shaders

Is The Last Word now a random drop only, or is the quest still available to New Lights?
---
Damn the Taken swerved harder then a friend zone crush on prom night.
---
tbh it should be Titan picking his nose at the back rdy to punch the nearest thing alive, warlock being all smart and commanding and Hunter being snarky and trigger-happy
---
i mean, an army of revenants with super powers that followed a shady faceless fraud of a religious head that didnt explain why we were doin anything aside from, "it's for the big ball and our survival"?  nah man it was obvious we were the good guys and not just another gray side being used.

Many people have. I haven‚Äôt even tried for it and I almost have it. It‚Äôs pretty easy if you play crucible at least somewhat regularly.
---
Oh I‚Äôm not saying it takes more than it gives. I‚Äôm already fabled 2 with only like 2 weeks of working towards it in the little amount I do play. I‚Äôm just saying the ‚Äúyou still get points if you play good and lose‚Äù rhetoric is wrong. It always takes points when you lose and it‚Äôs dumb, but it definitely takes waaaaay less than it gives when you win so I don‚Äôt really mind because I win more often than not
---
People have yes
---
Yeah I know, I‚Äôll still check it out when Xur comes this week however I did read just now about the quest being deleted.
---
Ah ok
---
Tell that to everyone whining about Jade Rabbit
---
I'm not saying that sniping doesn't take skill, it's just that the revoker is way too forgiving that it consistently returns missed bullets to the magazine. That's like an exotic perk. If it had a chance to, then it would seem more balanced. I was using it in a game and I body shot someone who was lagging, killed them and got the bullet back from the perk. This seems a bit ridiculous.
---
That quest line is one of the best in the franchise, hands down
---
If you were high while playing this game, tell me. How scary was literally anything?

I use swarm and it‚Äôs quite effective especially with gl ammo finder

It was a pinnacle. It has a unique perk. It‚Äôs like a mini ice breaker. It. Just bypasses the ammo economy. That‚Äôs all. A good beloved player will still do better.

Remember to stay away from it if you are on quests that punish you for dying. If I‚Äôm not mistaken, don‚Äôt do it if you‚Äôre on the Last Word quest as you can drop a lot of progress if you‚Äôre not getting 2 for 1‚Äôs the entire game.

Same thing happened here, I've been waiting almost 2 fucking weeks to get this sniper since i missed one of the forge ignitions and i had to wait a whole week to ignite it, then a couple of days for Bergusia to show up and finish the mold. Bungie can shove this sniper up their asses, I don't want it anymore.

Yes but what will Hunters blame then?

Holy crap, I didn't know this was a thing

Nah, cayde would have found that hilarious and probably would have tried to make some comment about it if it was the chicken mask.

Go to Amanda Holliday in the hangar at the tower. Your goal should be to finish the story and the following dlc which can all be done solo. Then finish exotic quests and other loose ends that add on the stories. Then do some pinnacle weapons like The Recluse. You should also be finishing up the storylines at this point. If you have forsaken and Shadowkeep you should complete those as well. Most of the quests you got at the beginning aren't important and can be done overtime as you complete the story. Once you hit 900, you should grind for powerful gear and use anything you can. This includes blues and all other gross ugly armor. Depending on your class you should look for specific mod and subclass builds that would fit your liking and play style. Finally, try and find a clan. As much as you might want to do everything alone, finding a clan will get you good gear to have more fun with. Clans are a big help and depending on if you find the right one, then you can eventually find a greater love for this game. That should be the basis that you go off of instead of worrying about all the stuff you get at the beginning.

That's a bad attitude to have in a game that is getting new players on the daily. Especially on a subreddit about the game in general, as opposed to the subreddit about the LORE. Or I suppose you never look up builds or item mechanics about any games you play?
---
All Nightfall: Ordeal tiers are farmable

 No after wasting all that time and effort for the last key bungie gives u a note that tells u to go fuck yourself

Never forget.

You can also get it randomly as a drop in the dungeon, thats how I got mine

Did you "carve it"... Oh no now you're marked for vengeance because you stabbed a knife and ripped its skin

I mean, it's not like Polaris is a rare exotic.

its arguably only OP in a single game mode and any 150 Aggressive Frame Scout 1-taps the same potential with better perks as Jade Rabbit.  Jade Rabbit is just the "Comes fresh from your Collections" Scout.   Polaris Lance works too. Source: I use the Vex Offensive Scout rifle and it 1-taps (200+ Dmg) as well with better Perks, not the least of which is Snapshot Sights.

What really makes this mode salty is Middle Tree Void Hunter,  I'm aware of how insane it is because I've used it a few times and it feels so dirty.

I would recommend also trying all three classes and all three of their elements with two different branches for each element to get A feel/ understanding of the gameplay.
---
Personally I loved going in the pit of heresy blind with 2 friends and not knowing what to do with the part where you have to hide from ogres.... And getting wall dicked...... Again.......
---
I don't think the game itself is bad. It was more of getting used to the mechanics, the whole 3rd to 1st person view ( I came into this thinking the whole game was 3rd person), and not being lore friendly yet, I had a bit of trouble realizing the beginning of the game is actually the end ect. I just gotta warm up to it
---
yes but i feel like it‚Äôs wasting the super part, especially since it‚Äôs rare to have them all grouped up to get the quad kill or even a triple kill. plus the fact they can just sniper you out of the air before you can even use it now
---
For the love of god...

Me and my buddies all ran rr and have done maybe 30 runs for fun the last month and never had this happen so idk

I‚Äôll try this. Thank you!

Should make one with the Titan smashing skreebs.

what's wrong?

Do I need to play and finish the first game to get a better understanding? (I assume so, but some sequels are just more of the same game (without story progression) if you get what I mean

Use the search function, I had the same problem, but I used my brain and scrolled down the D2 feed a few times and found 6 posts already about it

wooooooow arn't you just an asshole, assuming i was being judgmental because i answered Ops question, what would you do if someone said "this has been in since launch"? you now know it's no secret so you can fully google it without feel like you're cheating.

Titans are unfair what you mean? At least hunter needs to dodge and cant just spam melee key.

D1 had a better narrative to follow and it felt more personal with the main npc characters. I guess it's one of those games that grow on you the more you play and understand the story
---
I always found running top tree void. And really using the Dodge that makes you invisible as a crutch. Pair it with the 6th coyote for 2 Dodges, the wormhusk crown for health and Shield bumps is Handy as well.
---
I started with the warlock and like I stated on another post, the mechanics were just a bit wonky to start out with (the grenades trajectory for instance, threw me way off.) . When I return to the game I intend to look over everything and see what suits my playstyle best
---
Go to Amanda Holiday and pick up the first three story campaigns. They will give a bit of history to the current events at the tower. Minus the Halloween event that it currently running.
---
Also a tip, if there is one of the fragments you dont want to do (say the nightfall one), you can go back to the original place that used to drop each fragment, and get a duplicate of one you all ready completed

Nice

the black armory set was pretty nice, it was fun to have actual armor for a bit, but yeah, all our shit is trench coats, apparently we follow the spellcaster rules of not being allowed to wear actual armor, we have to be clothies

I'll watch it this weekend and hopefully It'll give me much more insight to the game
---
yea it‚Äôs definitely a lot to take in but they want you to go and do what everyone did at launch for Destiny 2. it‚Äôs just basically all thrown at you at once which is annoying. especially when the game thinks that your other two characters that you barely played are new light characters even tho you‚Äôve don‚Äôt a bunch of stuff on them
---
Same same same
---
Actually revoker was way harder before momentum control
---
Of only bungie would bring back all three great exotic swords...and the quests that went with them
---
Who's to say light that isn't stolen (aka non-Hive related deaths) doesn't just go back to the Traveler? And maybe now it's awake enough that it can resurrect specific people . I mean we barely know anything about the Traveler, so the writers could do anything with it.
---
Shows how dumb warlocks are if you believe our tower has to be destroyed a 2nd time for d3 lol
---
Seriously, the kill feed is just jade rabbits. I found a guy who didn't actually cap any points or anything, instead, he just crouched at the back of the map and kept getting kills and then using the truesight to get even more kills, not playing any objectives.

Umm do you ever do any of the strikes mate? Lol

Look for the yellow stars in activities and white stars in the tower map for challenges.

Traveler led them to our doorstep and turned tail as soom as the Darkness showed up. Sure it may be protecting us but I find it suspicious that at the first sign of trouble in every case the Traveler ran. Even if it was taking a stand with us its using an army of imortals to guard itself and thats mighty suspicious.

Long and short is maybe the Traveler should start singing before some more enterprising guardians take their business to the only other shop in town. Even if that other business is the actually evil one.

I love the game mode, getting rid of radar is a huge improvement and less time to kill is so much better imo. Maybe somewhere in the middle of normal ttk and current momentum control ttk would be about right though because ljke you say the jade rabbit is just being abused. But then again I‚Äôve been having fun destroying people with my graviton lance haha.

I don't feel so good, Mr. Traveler.

Oh yeah I Can definitely hear you scream. Cuz damn the first time that thing scared the sh*t out of me.

The wall hack part of that skill only lasts 3 seconds (plenty of time TBH) but with Graviton the invis can be ~9 seconds.

That mode is tons of OP TBH it‚Äôs really not for the faint of heart.

It‚Äôs pretty tough I‚Äôd say, especially since on PC there‚Äôs a bug where you can die from a loading screen sometimes unless you cap your frames at 30. (What I‚Äôve heard).

I have two really fast m.2 drives in raid, but the white loading screen between title and character selection still takes like 30 seconds to load.

That is unacceptable, I've spent too much money on my pc just to not to have to worry about long load times.

I think it‚Äôs going to be like The Vorlons vs Shadows in Babylon 5.

I believe at the Hellmouth, by where the Witches' Ritual public event happens

The hunters should be replaced with titans though
---
Um have you done the newest raid??? The first boss is constantly moving in DPS phase, and the last boss is only immobile for like 3 seconds. Also come on, Izanagi IS a weeb and edgy weapon. A ornament is literally called Ronin. The description is Ada-1s weeb diary. And the lore page just looks like some shitty fanfiction.

Just mess around with the settings to try and work it out I reckon.

I hold the opinion of the top pvp players. You shouldn't be able to autistically spam 4 body shots with last word. You should be actively penalized for body shotting. You should be either getting headshots or you shouldn't be getting kills.

This by no means makes me a top pvp player, but I agree with them that you shouldn't reward bad players for playing bad. You should have a game that emphasizes skilled play and punishes poor play.
---
What‚Äôs lame about it?

What a burden trying to get the Izanagi.

Ive done leviathan a ton of times the past couple weeks and have been getting light level related drops.

ECHOES ACT THREEEEEEE

I disagree. The whole point of it was to pick someone you had an actual emotional connection with, one that would shake the *other* characters with their sudden death. Any new character introduced in Y1 wouldn‚Äôt have had that same impact, because who the hell cares about some new character. Even some lesser supporting characters like Petra or Eris wouldn‚Äôt have had the same impact; Petra we didn‚Äôt have a super-strong connection with, and Eris dying would have been a borderline blessing (in a ‚Äúshe‚Äôs suffered so much, now she‚Äôs at peace‚Äù sort of way), which doesn‚Äôt exactly lend itself to a revenge quest. The other major NPC vendors wouldn‚Äôt work because they have very specific functions within the game (not just the lore). Losing Shaxx would have an impact, but then the Crucible would lose a certain flavor that it‚Äôs had since the very beginning; same with Saladin. Killing Banshee wouldn‚Äôt have had much impact, especially since a story forcing him to leave the Tower would‚Äôve seem out of place and they‚Äôd just have to add a new gun guy. I suppose they could have killed off Tess and everyone would‚Äôve been happy, though...
---
No, it had to be one of the core three Vanguard, because we‚Äôve been with them since the very beginning. Kill Zavala? He‚Äôs such a stoic, noble warrior; for him to die in battle would be seen as a fitting end, not a tragedy. Kill Ikora? Perhaps that would stir everyone up, but it‚Äôd be a bit of a character assassination (in more ways than one, ba-dum-psh!) because she‚Äôs supposed to be such a wise and powerful Guardian that it wouldn‚Äôt seem right. But Cayde? Cayde is that guy everyone likes, that everyone has fun with. You kill *that* guy, and you‚Äôre setting a very specific, very dark tone. When you kill the guy that everyone likes, that will cause reverberations across all the other characters that the others just wouldn‚Äôt quite match.
---
I mean in Scrims it bans LW, and rapid fire snipers and a lot of other stuff so....
---
If your holding the regard of top PvP players you would know that people hate it because it can four to the body not because it completely rewards bad plays.
---
It‚Äôs the same logic of NF, a okay player will spam it as fast as they can and miss 99% of there shots. Where as a very good player would pace there shots as I did and lots of my clan and we would two-tap or be able to half people‚Äôs health completely.
---
Ohh it worked thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
There's a good reasons why Titans are getting shat on, tho.
---
Wait what? Why can you hold so many bounties? I can only hold like, 21? Maybe it‚Äôs cuz I have so many quests...?
---
Yeah it seems to be a common issue with all the pinnacle quests for some reason.
---
I recognize a Watchmen reference when I see one.
---
What is the prize anyway?
---
First reset unlocks the curated Trust, second the curated Bad Omens, and third gets you a ghost shell.
---
The one he had marked for vengeance.
---
It'll get locked until you buy it
---
Just learned this today but the amount of bounties you can store depends on the  amount of quests you have, the max number is 63 and both your bounties and quests go into that
---
If the vex wanted to invade they wouldnt wait for a guardian to maybe build a portal. They would just invade but since they cant simulate light they wouldnt know how it would go i guess.

We had 41 seconds remaining which was a little tense.

So I dun goofed mate, check out my original comment. Sorry if I got your hopes up lmao
---
I was once ddosed by a 3-stacks in comp but for once I could identify them, I reported all 3 since I didn't know which one did it. My home internet was down for 3 hours so I decided to check for these morons on lfg servers on my phone and can you believe I found them sitting casually in a voice channel ? I joined and one of them admitted to it whining about how hard comp was, 2 hours after I reported him he told me he got banned but the other 2 weren't.
---
Long story short, I guess bungie has ways to sort it out.
---
Got a Kale error or two that kicked me from the match. No anteaters, though.
---
Honestly didn't see this posted before, sorry if my post got under your skin üôÉ.
---
I mean you sorta got a point bro.
---
Maybe just any sort of error will throw the game out of wack? Have you tried doing them again since resetting the game, maybe it'd help?
---
Lol imagine if I could hahha your cool
---
how many seasons are there? i‚Äôve heard 13, 14, and 16
---
That kind of thing happens to me all the time. Every full curse week in the Dreaming City, I go to the Oracle and get annoyed that it says I don't have an offering even though I did the bounty. It always turns out that I forgot to turn it in.
---
As someone who played at release and is now getting back in, it‚Äôs daunting. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs limited time and what‚Äôs not. I know to do weekly activities and bounties for the most xp and best gear gain, but that‚Äôs about it.

That's the chalice. Right click on it and it should open up the screen where you put all the runes and stuff.

You will find these phantoms at any Lost Sector that contains Nightmares.

What is that a loyal friend quest above the Erianas Vow Catalyst?

Didn't see this posted before?  Do you even look at this subreddit?
---
Very nice. Beloved is amazing
---
You get these from Anna on Mars.  Once decrypted they are used to open the final EP boss chest for a piece of EP armor.
---
You need 7 Rasputin key fragments to buy a Blue encrypted cache key.  (Found in nightfalls, strikes, and a few other activities, but nightfalls are best because you can get 7 in one run).  You an only hold 7 keys max at one time.
---
Once you have 7 keys you can buy the encrypted cache key from Anna.  Second page of her inventory to purchase.  You can only buy one per week and you can only hold one at a time.
---
Once you have the blue encrypted cache key from Anna, you need to decrypt it.  To decrypt the key you have to clear 7 EP levels. As you clear each lvl you will see "Encrypted Cache Key" pop up on your screen....you are not earning a new key....you are just charging the one you have...
---
Once you clear 7 levels of EP you will see "Decrypted Cache Key" pop up on your screen and the Key in your quest inventory will turn purple....you can hold several of these at one time.  If you cleared all 7 levels at one time, and defeated a final boss a chest will appear.  The Decrypted key is used to open the chest.

It‚Äôs crazy because that‚Äôs what it seems like.  There was literally no mention of RvB until I said something.
---
Literally everyone else on this sub.
---
People are going to be...hesitant if you're so new because the deal with raids is there designed to be impossible to clear if certain mechanics aren't coordinated properly (usually the encounter will just flat out kill everyone if they don't know what they're doing). Don't let that dissuade you, though, basically anybody *can* raid as long as they have the team and are willing to learn complex mechanics.
---
But if you want a "raid lite" experience just to see what it's like, the Menagerie from Season of Opulence is perfect and includes matchmaking. It has a lot of the elements of the raids; even has some tuned-down versions of the exact mechanics in certain rooms. Also the Menagerie just slows down your progress and reduces your rewards, rather than wiping your group if you aren't coordinating properly and executing the mechanics. Plus you can start building up your arsenal while you run it (Menagerie is still a great source for grinding for specific rolls on a weapon)
---
You can (and should) look up a video beforehand on how each room works so you at least have an idea of what to do. That's good practice for raids as well, which require a lot of planning ahead of time and fore-knowledge to clear. Fortunately each room only has like 1 or 2 mechanics so you'll be able to identify pretty quickly what's going to happen.
---
Yea I completed the lost sector.

It's the last lost ghost quest. The ghost is located at the 2nd encounter with the ogres in the Pit of Heresy dungeon.
---
That'll do nicely!
---
My average is around 55-60 minutes

How do you start that quest line?

Oh gotcha.  Thanks.  I will try adding mods cuz now most of my Armor is 900-910 and can't find much better stuff in PvP matches anyway.

Thanks bud :)

You need to have a lost ghost trace drop on the moon. To start the string of lost ghost quests you need to speak to Eris Morn and complete her questline.

One Eyed Mask. Exotic Titan helmet
---
There is no real reason to keep gear if you don't plan to use it. It doesn't magically do anything if you hoard it. You are supposed to dismantle unused items. 
---
I do recommend saving at least one gun of each weapon type, since there are a lot of bounties that ask you to use a particular weapon type, so it is convenient to have one around.
---
‚ÄúOne Eyed Mask‚Äù is an exotic that gives a Titan an overshield if they kill someone who has damaged them in the last 5-10 seconds.

You report them for being bad?

Yes it sure did! I‚Äôm playing the f2p New Light version of the game, so some challenges require the DLC. Fortunately, the Festival of the Lost has a couple of weekly challenges that are available even for f2p players. So I was able to do the challenge for defeating 25 terrors in the haunted forest. That successfully completed the challenge for the bounty.
---
Side note: I haven‚Äôt completed the other challenge (reach branch 9) from festival of the lost. It‚Äôs not necessary for the chalice bounty since I completed the terror one. I can never get past branch 6. But if anyone stumbles upon this post, just know you only need one of the weekly challenges to complete the bounty even if there are multiple available for your selected destination/activity.
---
Well he knows where OP is, and OP isn't strafing, so he can basically line up the shot before coming in view. Then he steps out as he fires and voila, easy headshot.
---
Anyone figure this out yet?

Man, your lucky! Cross play must not be an issue for you, it sucks cus most of my friends play Xbox.

It also marks the person that damaged them, allowing the OEM wearer to see them through walls

a lot of people have been complaining about it after the release of momentum control, and here's a reason why.

‚ÄúNo warning‚Äù

‚ÄúI got a 2 month ban a while back‚Äù

I like Rick kackis but he does tend to drone on and say the same thing a bit

I went into a crucible game against Ninja with no L. I think it's obligatory to solo ult.

The striker part is in reference to bottom tree striker, which is currently one of the best pvp supers
---
Didn't know the thing about the specific bounty-weapons. Thank you!
---
With a group that knows it well I can do it in 40 minutes but normally 1hour 30 minutes
---
I‚Äôd just work to complete it, might give it to you? Or it might consider it already done somehow
---
Yup I kinda want to play RDR2 again now lol
---
The aim assist on the jade rabbit is actually insane
---
Does it mark similar to foe tracer?
---
Find someone who has the rose and do activities with them.  The more people in the fireteam using rose the faster you progress.  You might want to LFG Menagerie for and put in your post you are working on Lumina quest.  You may find others doing the same and can get it done quickly with a fireteam of 6 using rose.
---
No you don't he still talks on strikes everywhere he's fine
---
Looks like you have to reinstall the game according to a quick search
---
#AAAAAAAARGH!

Sometimes we console peasants need a helping hand :) hahaha, that being said its fucking true that aim assist is A1.

by the way if you are only 937 you should power level some more, the final boss is recommended 960 and if you want xenophage its recommended 970

Whilst it opened up to to everything else, it shut down a lot of people‚Äôs favourite way to play. I can‚Äôt use a sniper anymore because I have nothing to pair it with. HC/sidearms were my go to but they‚Äôre out gunned by a recluse and I refuse to use one.
---
Wow recluse your sooo good

So the black armory key won‚Äôt count?

No, best bet is go in with 6 in a voice chat and agree to all go to seperate spawns

watch (as much as i hate to say it) rick kackis‚Äôs videos on how to do the raids because explaining a raid encounter before the encounter or during it is super annoying for your fireteam and just wastes so much time and will usually cause a lot of wipes. also for only being 3 weeks into the game, i don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôll be ready for the raids, skill and weapon wise.
---
F
---
Oohhhhh thank you
---
I don‚Äôt remember what first watch is tbh
---
I have joined to watch the last quarter of the primevil health vanish to a defeat screen. That's nonsense.

i just infuse weapons whenever im doing a high power actovity and i need to use that weapon

Finally?? It has been out for a few days - I haven't had a chance to step inside you; but glad you 'finally' solo'd it :'D

what does this mean 18+ i was born in 1592

Mainly what you need to look for BEFORE invading is as follows: 1. How many motes are they CARRYING not banked, carried. 2. Make sure you bank your motes BEFORE invading 3. Check how many blockers you have over there because if there are multiple they will absolutely be fighting the blockers to get their motes banked (AKA easy targets loaded with motes in the middle)
---
can confirm, ritual weapons and pinnacle weapons have always been free
---
Damn, I want this as a phone wallpaper, it looks so good!
---
You see I couldn‚Äôt do this because 
---
1: id be missing every shot
---
2: I reload after missing every shot
---
Also, you need to see what YOUR team prioritizes, if there's 3 guys going hamtaro on the mobs with motes but you have blockers stacking up against you, take it on yourself to let your team get their motes while you destroy the blockers. This can really help a lot!
---
Then why is my warlock a hunter in the cutscene? That makes no sense

Totally agree, someone else said Control is favorable because it's "easily accessible" but I think a regular clash match without supers would be more accessible to new players.

dont apologise its a pinnacle weapon!! it always has been and always will be!

So for the Harbinger seal, does anyone know if the time trials have to be done on master? Or can they be done on any difficulty?
---
I noticed that each nightmare hunt has a separate trial for finishing the "master" time trials, but the one for the seal just says finish the time trials.
---
Why do I feel like this is what he'd look like as a guest star on captain planet

You'd have to ask them that question for an answer.

Bungie released a statement warning people not to do this, it‚Äôs getting fixed and patched at a later date.

Thanks my man for taking the time to explain :-)
---
Nope randy‚Äôs is easy.
---
GOOOOOOOOOOOOD
---
I agree with that but how useable are they
---
Usually a failed to download rather than a failed to install would suggest a network related issue. Maybe try putting your console in a DMZ through your wireless router?
---
i got some poopy chest piece
---
Infuse?
---
Just don't play it dude no need to get wound up
---
Quick question: do any of the nightmare hunts have a decent chance of dropping their essence if you already have it? I'm considering farming love and death but if I have to go through one phantasmal core each I probably won't bother.
---
Ah well
---
Agreed.
---
I have blues that are higher level. Can‚Äôt infuse those? I‚Äôm new.
---
My response to the stupidest fucking statement in gaming history
---
I don‚Äôt care if anyone is forcing anyone to play anything or not, if that thing is broken or unbalanced I will say something about it, no one forced anyone to play comp in season 3 yet there was huge outcry about the Radar
---
I see cheers
---
me and my buddies are grinding the 950 nightfall so maybe i‚Äôll get it that way
---
I ran a devour warlock (I didn't use nezarec's sin which would help way more with ability recharge) with izanagi, arsenic bite and 21% delirium. I would usually focus killing most of the acolytes first then move to the left side and kill that knight. Btw when all of this is going on make sure to have devour activated cause it helps a ton. Once I dunked the orb I focused on the thrall chasing me first cause its almost impossible to kill the knights while they are chasing you. You don't always have to be on the plate so moving around in the middle while the knights are alive is huge to staying alive
---
OEM is actually useless in momentum
---
No wait until you‚Äôre in a fireteam of six!

That‚Äôs because that item is currently not available.

You need candy to infuse the mask. I think it was 1k.
---
None of the original storylines give exotics anymore.
---
All year one
---
Yeah I did give the 920 nightfall a crack with two randos and it was a nightmare
---
I personally prefer warlock , singularity nova boom is a very powerful burst damage skill , devour buff make you literally can't die (really good for solo mission ) , healing/empower rift can heal and buff ally which is always good in any scenario . 
---
warlock could just fit in so many role , 
---
dps ? Nova boom , 
---
tank? Devour 
---
buff ? Rift, well of radiance , solar charge grenade
---
Im glad we can infuse this year. Last year was horseshit

Thanks my unlucky guardian

Lemme tell ya mine has outlaw and full auto trigger system and it's wild man

@_@ Jesus, I'm getting in the crucible now.
---
oh boy
---
In case you didn't know, make sure to wear the mask when doing any activities. (I didn't know at first, as it's my first FOTL). 
---
It may not have been efficient, but I've been doing strikes, at least one forest run, heroic public events, and heroic story missions. I only have one mask left to get.

Thank you kind sir
---
Yeah I dunno the more I think about it. Like if you used Ace of Spades or something to get really fast primary kills and proc MoA there could be *something* to that cycle of swapping to it, I just think Titan has too many better exotics. But always pick up exotics you don't have yet from Xur regardless.
---
Yep it was a tier 5 event and I opened the chest
---
Titans can‚Äôt read
---
Ah found it, thanks everyone!
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not finding that I‚Äôm getting that much more progress than regular crucible for Randy‚Äôs. Still enjoying the mode though
---
No, I'm pretty sure that Holiday...
---
&gt;when did mountaintop have void subclass?
---
doing the scour quest they gave me an almost perfect claws of the wolf and OMG it hard for me to not use it. easily my favorite PvP weapon ATM
---
As a warlock main and hunter sub, this is what killed this game mode. I also got rtk legit just for this to come out lol
---
then how are you playing nessu
---
Sure you are loud mouth.
---
You look like ellen degeneres just entered the matrix.
---
I was this was a humansbeingbros subreddit until i got to "My crucible teammates" and was like wtf. Then I looked at the sub and was like ah. okay i see, makes more sense lmao
---
Haunted forest is the halloween event, srl isn‚Äôt actually an special event its just an activity active every now and then.
---
This mans living in 11-16-19 meanwhile the rest of us stuck in 11-1-19
---
I don‚Äôt know why, but for some reason I feel like the answer can be found somewhere up there.
---
Dude ive been grinding for it myself. Could never get the perfect roll. Came close yesterday
---
Im so proud of you guardian..and I want you to have my upvote - Lord Shaxx
---
If that video is was posted before October 1st, probably not. The new system of getting bright dust is completely different from the old system. 
---
You can only get Bright Dust from the bounties I was talking about. You can‚Äôt get them from the Seasonal Engrams that you get from Tess anymore.
---
I do feel for the new players. That‚Äôs been a brutal bug to deal with. I‚Äôd be pissed too and don‚Äôt blame them.
---
New Light players weren't here back then.
---
You don‚Äôt gotta be an ass. You do know the game went ftp and there a huge influx of new people right?
---
Throw on Astrocite for even more blinky fun
---
ow... the feels.
---
What's the link to the original article? I'm interested in reading it.
---
What?
---
I would also like the pdf
---
Okay.
---
not ready nor willing, but prepared for anything.
---
EXPLAIN
---
I'm so glad the OP posted this. I've been wondering the same thing. Although I thought it was a weekly rotation like Escalation Protocol so I guess I'll have to wait 48 hours or so for Blasphemer again. I got the sniper the day before yesterday and judging by the comments the shotgun was yesterday (and I missed it...) so I'm assuming the rocket launcher is on the roster for today...? Then it repeats...? It's a crying shame that there's so little information regarding something you'd assume would be important knowledge for the community. Gotta love Reddit!
---
It was an example, SRL can fit 1 week every month like  the iron banner, just a funny activity with unique drops, this game lacks of this type of things and I Play from D1 beta, I love Bungie and Destiny but it feels a bit too serious right now with all this hard activities and very long term grinding, I know we are a minority but with my little time to play it feels good to do something easy and Funny with your friends.
---
There is a YouTuber "battle(non)sense" who explains bungies trash p2p/hybrid bull sh*t networking system. Bungie remains the physics engine host and the world host and players communicate with each other and the hosts so u have all the crappy experience of p2p with the random predictive behavior associated with dedicated server based systems where the game tries to predict where u r and what u r doing and either rewards u or screws u over (u know, how u would randomly get snipped from behind cover or someone else is rewarded kill credit for your kill), independent of what u actually are seeing on your screen. So as D2 population dwindles (it is already dwindling as barely anyone on my clan is playing it right now, may be quarter of a page), depending on the game mode, you could be facing players in areas much farther away from u, making the whole experience that much worse for u, as every client is having to communicate with every other client so, crappy internet for one leads to crappy experience for anyone else not near them. I've been noticing this kind of BS in momentum control, where some dude from Puerto Rico (I've got netduma) will take 3 shots to die but he is wrecking everyone with one, and unfortunately i cant make it past 2 games before turning it off. I'm not sure if I have hope for this game/franchise any more
---
I agree hunters are the greatest
---
Lucky pants are great if you are going for Luna‚Äôs
---
She should've given you amachine gun frame, it'll be in your quest log. Follow that and it will unlock the fitness for you.
---
I mean if you can enough people interested to warrant srl coming back that often then you would have your fun.
---
No it's the exo dance emote
---
Exo dance emote
---
:c
---
Wasnt low effort or a rant. Youre just a crybaby you dont have the gun. Cry more shit mod.OMEGALULW
---
Where is this?
---
GL!
---
Yeah my exp exactly when interacting in crucible or gambit with other players. You see truth projectile hit player, but he just moves along like nothing happened.  Or as you say you die from one bullet ( you think it was one bullet) but you never got any feedback from other bullets so makes you think that weapons are OP when its the shitty (servers p2p etc) fucking up  your experience even when you have fiber 300/300 with 5-10ms latency to whatever servers on various speed-tests you run.
---
That last response just sounds like a bot
---
This was me.  Didn't get it until last week on a seasonal exotic unlock.  And even then, my skill in crucible is so terrible that I can't even be one of those Titans that ruin it for everyone.  LOL
---
Is this a /s?
---
I played this mission today for the first time and obviously i knew beforehand about the spiders faction being fallen. I heard Petra say the line and shot them anyway. Musclememory at its finest.
---
Don't you know that no one is bad at PvP? If they lose it must be cheating, or lag, or OP weapons, or Bungie, or the Loch Ness Monster. But it's absolutely not them.
---
Oh I dont care. I'm just saying the obvious. This subreddit eats shitty titan memes 24/7. I guarantee you if someone took my idea they would get over 10K upvotes in less then 24 hours. There's a reason why the official destiny subreddit doesn't allow memes.
---
Quest is easy. Play the game.
---
_Brings back the hawkmoon_
---
You have to earn a code in game before you can buy it. Same with raid jackets/shirts ect.
---
I believe the price is $140 or something
---
It‚Äôs because you have to earn a code through the game that reduces it to a legit price.
---
Maybe as a taken or something
---
Agreed. Why can‚Äôt people see that?
---
If you look when it first starts theres a square with a circle lock thats red, when you stand on it it would slowly turn white, but theres nothing in between untill it starts loading the mini levels. Take a look when you load up. Im not home but ill post a picture of what im talking about when im home
---
Ah ok, i will try that. Thank you for the help , appreciate it.
---
you get a discount code from playing the game that lowers the price
---
A lot of our helmets suck too.
---
Do werners treasure map bounties, run menagarie and unlock triumphs, both of these will give you imperials to level up your Challice
---
No

This is the company I ordered from
---
One of the best handcannons. Its worth the orbs alone to masterwork but you also get increased firefly explosion damage. If you like using it then I would say go for it!
---
My game bugged out and I have had the quest to complete an activity anywhere in the system while wearing a mask and it gave me the engram lol
---
Yes the same I was thinking to after dropping the ship in my first
---
I had the milestone quest still up on my hunter for an entire year somehow it bugged and stayed up and it just now completed.
---
Not at all lol
---
same here, didn't check on twitter, they could post it in game or something,the solution will be abandon the quest and start all over again like nothing happened.
---
At least i hope you can do it on same guardian again.
---
It gets me more at phase two. Like just wait ONE MORE round it's not that hard!!
---
They are random drops from the forest
---
Howd ya get the shaxx mask??
---
I read the ‚Äúand‚Äù in Devrim‚Äôs voice.
---
‚ÄúDo you know what I like about you, Guardian? You do things big
---
**and**
---
you do them with style.‚Äù
---
If you slow it down though you were pretty on target. They both hit head.
---
It works with eriana's vow
---
I miss the Factions.
---
They ban players with bad connections but wont ban players who leave COMP. As leaving COMP will still make other players experience enjoyable. Laughable excuse Bungie
---
That would be a great ideea actually
---
*pats grave*
---
30 min
---
I kind of enjoy my gliding, and I haven't really had much success with blink, though I've been trying to see if works. 
---
I just don't get much distance, less so than a normal jump.
---
If you got to pay someone to get things for you in the game...why are you even playing?  Nothing in the game is hard to get.
---
Each one gets longer than the last.
---
I believe they start at 30 minutes.
---
Almost felt like when the Elite first dropped in to help Master Chief
---
Throw more grenades
---
I need a gamemode that let's me use as many exotics as i want
---
This sort of shit occurred a lot for me about 4 months ago. I think that it‚Äôs because my internet connection wasn‚Äôt optimal, so opponents thought that I had invincibility hacks or the likes. I‚Äôm glad that it no longer happens.
---
Shit back in my day xur was at the tower
---
Hey I remember this meme from last nnn
---
Witch-hunting is severely against the rules.
---
You heretic! You‚Äôre a Hunter!
---
Same, I loved to blink into a room full of people and pop my bladedancer midair and just go all out
---
I like shaxx
---
Can someone help xur go to Mars, mercury, dreaming city, or the moon. go explore Xur!
---
Any story with Shaxx is a good Shaxx story. [Here‚Äôs him having sex with Mara Sov](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/mark-of-the-great-hunt)
---
Completely forgot I was on a destiny sub when I read this
---
Nah Arcite 99-40
---
Actually they can most certainly kill you if they are dead
---
Wait it out until Tuesday when iron banner comes ez 100% win
---
Zoinks.

open the chests on the barge too

Oh, well they didn't get sweet loot, fuck em.

Wow, that looks absolutely gorgeous! I really love how you captured the expression, he looks so sad :(
---
Ah momentum. So fun. So stupid. But so even.
---
Bruh, that's me in crucible üòÇ
---
I get what you were trying to say, maybe the format just didn't make sense to me lol.
---
 I could see how you would think it is toxic, but alot of people are doing it just to get randy/ catalysts. I know otherwise, I'd never touch a scout rifle in my life lol.
---
Yeah, Dodge and Blink wouldn't be infuriating at all.
---
I really hope we investigate deepstone crypt at some point. Caydes stash definitely made them sound sinister.
---
Spoopy
---
Of course it‚Äôs going to get more cheaters but i guess i live in an area where there aren‚Äôt many cheaters, mostly Internet Time-Lords
---
I don‚Äôt think so! When you edit your subclass, near the bottom, there should be an option to change your ‚Äòglide type.‚Äô 
---
For the void warlock there should be a ‚Äòblink‚Äô option.
---
shut mouth
---
Time to get off the internet. Your parents are going to be home soon.
---
I just started playing, I figured the captains WERE the large blockers. Good to know!

Remember when hunters had blink?

Good times.
