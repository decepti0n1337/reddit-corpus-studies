As long as you get the rest of the quest done this season your good you’ll get it
---
Okay but why
---
Quick question 
---
Why
---
Oryx is already sexy we don’t need this
---
I wonder what back story is to image
---
1st person to do it gets a free collectors edition of shadowkeep
---
As a recall last year it was max light when fully upgraded to Legendary. Might be the same this year
---
I did 4 t3’s and got like 100 just now. For anyone needing to do reckoning, just lfg fireteam. So much simpler.
---
DFA may be a year 1 HC but its crisp as hell
---
Ohhh boiii its grenade launcher frustration time!
---
Just ask Mara Sov -OH WAIT
---
Changes with the curse. There will be a new boss next reset.
---
They can drop with different shaders on them. Shadow guilt is the most common shader though.
---
Photo op more than likely
---
"If you're nothing without it then you shouldn't have it."
---
Now that yout mention it... no
---
Damnit Sneasel, get it together
---
What was your character’s power level when you got them?
---
Pretty sure most of the planets you have to wait until it comes up as the flashpoint.
---
Y’all act like y’all couldn’t wait to complete the 80 percent discount before going bonkers with the bright dust
---
Even with three weeks to grind engrams your not going to earn even close to 15000 bright dust.  9 engrams per account per week for three weeks even if you got all exotics to dismantle, which you won't, would still only get you 13,500 bright dust.

LFG.

You only need the legendary version, no masterworks.

---
Sometimes you need to send a message to a motherfucker
---
I think there is always room for more. You might want to think about focusing on one aspect of destiny, I find myself gravitating towards podcasts that single out concepts of greater subjects
---
Honeyyyyy, wheres my Outbreak Prime????
---
We believe in you
---
Dokkan meme I like
---
I can understand raids people don’t want to spend hours doing the same thing especially if they are not up to teach, but nightfalls? If you need someone to do a nightfall with you and you play Xbox hit me up at blargguy
---
yep
---
ah i had quit during the release of the lens but i heard about it but i didnt know about the lord of wolves being op
---
For even more context I was writing this post when the game ended and the massage me asking if I was mad that I could work on my armor. Turns out there entire clan is queuing up and going into game to stop people from working on the armor while they protect there friend who is working on there armor so they are doing it in shifts. I hate people who do this.
---
Thanks I appreciate it but I’m on PC
---
So I can safely dismantle them now, and come Moon's spooky, I can get them back for shards? Ah shi.. shanks I didn't know that.
---
might as well wait for year 3 annual pass
---
Orrr maybe don’t afk farm
---
Could I get a screenscreen of this? I have a great idea
---
But where’s the cayde statue at ?
---
Wow, BDF upvotes your garbage comment?  Bungie hurt me, duh.
---
*death is too good for you*
---
Are you connected through a baked potato or something
---
That would be a cool job
---
Gamer Entitlement is real. This whole thing is crazy to me. You’re talking about a video game, you not being oppressed. No one forced you into the AFK rebellion against the Imperial Forces of Bungie in the quest for the Dopest Helm. You played how many hours of this game? Suddenly a helmet is dropped and now you can’t go on without the helmet, so you need to lame-cheat to get the helmet because without the helmet the game will not be enjoyable. 
---
I think anyone who is playing this game, while admittedly not enjoying it, is silly. To play a game you don’t like so you can get an unlock in the game that you think will suddenly make you like the game again is crazy. 
---
What’s more, I don’t agree that purchasing the expansion entitles you to every drop. I enjoy Destiny, so I play it. When it begins to be a chore, I’ll stop. There’s a whole world of other things to do. Whining about algorithms and shit is a bad look.
---
I haven’t played Destiny 2 in a while I’m on vacation, and i see this and I’m like wow i missed a lot.
---
Wait till you see the blue requirements.
---
1500 orbs.
---
500 strike orbs.
---
Defeat 75 guardians with arc.
---
The bullshit has only just begun.
---
Excited? Bungie better fricken give me enhanced armor perk mod drops from dismantling said armor so my months of grinding the best fricking rolls on Armor hasn't been for naught.
---
Yeah it sucks
---
Omg no.....
---
Is it available now?
---
I just got the helmet complete quickly and was back on OEM for the crucible portion. Don't  @ me
---
Seriously, I feel your pain. The months I played without getting Geomags was staggering to me. I completed loaded question, breakneck, earned wayfarer and dredgen, all while only needing Geomags. Dupe after dupe, no Geomags. The exotic drop is broken. 
---
But, afk in crucible and Gambit screws the guardians trying to enjoy the game. You knew it and you did it anyway. I wish you had gotten a solid, substantial temporary ban. 
---
As another commenter said, enjoy your next game and if this situation comes up in it, please, take a break instead of cheating. Borderlands will probably be pretty fun and hard to take too seriously.
---
Yeah
---
No
---
Analysis**
---
You should do a piece just for the ace of spades. It’s such a pretty gun.
---
Mine is stuck on 2/3. I'm on Nessus and killed a minotaur that spawns in the hallows (1/3), then I killed a despoiler captain (2/3), but when I found another captain it didn't count when I killed it. I killed another one of those and another minotaur but it's still stuck on 2/3.
---
This is what I internet for
---
 Happened with an experienced team on PS4. Good for a laugh....
---
No imo
---
sounds like you're bad and don't know how to actually play against anything. I would reccomend improving yourself instead of trying to get the game improved for you
---
You get it from eververse
---
i'd like to see a big team battle like game mode in this map. we know with the tower and open world that you can load plenty of guardians in the same spot. it would be a sniper battle with close quarter inside the buildings. just make that the supers charge 50% slower or something to not end up like mayhem and taada. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
for the game mode it could be diverse. like capture point there. eliminate enemy boss before your own dies. plant bomb at point before enemy before the other and defend the charge etc. 
---
I know im saying nonesense but a zone like that cant be wasted on an event gamemode alone. we can do so much with it
---
No I mean why does that adventure give you so many orbs?
---
The Hells Angels are way less intimidating now that they only ride Vespa’s.
---
The screen shake makes me nauseous. I’d use it now and again otherwise.
---
r/sharditkeepit
---
Yep, pretty ironic when this community is going nuts for AFK Forge farming but they're literally getting erections thinking about how someone else got perma banned for AFK farming.
---
A warning would have sufficed, it was one of my two rules for stopping.  Same result, but one of them involves me never playing the game again or spending hundreds more dollars on the franchise.
---
**PRAISE THE SUN!**
---
Left over from the last time the EAZ was used?
---
You have to complete the objectives for every piece per set and then meditate after equipping the set. It’s not piece by piece.
---
looks like someone cheesed
---
2 for your subclass, one for your weapon’s element. But they disappear kinda quick
---
ok thank you, literally nobody could answer that for me.
---
Beware the rocks.
---
No worries, enjoy the solstice.
---
you can easily reset twice a day during Iron Banner double/triple valor. pretty sure its retroactive, but if you hold one from now till you get to that step, then play some pvp between that and next IB then your last reset during IB should be mega free. either way don't worry about it.
---
Nah make it easier on the enemy and blind meh. They will still perish.
---
&gt;If you're going to afk something at least do it in a game mode that won't screw over other people who may have had a streak going.
---
Have you even played fucking Gambit lately?
---
It's a shit show of people trying to grind out quests which are counter-productive to the objectives in Gambit.  Aside from that, most of my matches had at least 3 other AFK players, meaning over half the gambit queue is bots.  
---
I mention how it takes 10 hours on average for one Spare Rations and the odds of a good roll are less than 1/1,000.  Do you not see the fucking problem with the game?  Do you not comprehend why the fuck Unbroken, Shadow, Dredgen, Rivensbane and Blacksmiths are AFK farming Gambit prime?  
---
Win streaks are irrelevant when the game is broken, sorry you suck at Gambit and can't get win streaks.  I did the Dredgen grind last season no AFK, Gambit isn't what it used to be, there was no reason to waste my time sitting at the keyboard.
---
This is like the mountaintop of pve grinds
---
Yeah, kind of sucks how Gambit HVTs are *explicitly* called out but don't count.
---
Don't forget ur complementary lunafacs
---
It's apparently not so bad on PC with the catalyst, but us console peasants have amplified recoil for some reason.
---
Original template please
---
I for the life of me hate handcannons in PvP. I prefer pulses. But I like supernova for the shotgun  sliders. It's so funny watching them slide to instant death lol.
---
Thanks for offering me the perspective of someone who hasn't experienced the rough edges of the game yet.  I've already had that experience long ago when everything was fresh and fun and amazing, and I had many new exotics to chase and unlock.  
---
Try playing for a few seasons to the point where you have every exotic but the most recent one.  Then wait for a particular season offering the one thing you're most excited about.  Experience 40 exotic drops where you think for 0.5 seconds this is finally it!  But all 40 times, you got something you already had, which Bungie has said they nerfed duplicate exotics.  My odds of duplicates were 100% this season and I've experienced over 40 of them.  You literally can't relate.  
---
Did your beta ex mention anything about how D1 blink was so much better than D2 blink?  That's because D2 blink is broken.  Instead of fixing it, they waited over a year and then released D1 blink as RNG-based paid DLC.  Imagine that.  Your ex spent countless hours of his time grinding for nothing to show for it, and you're using him as an example of someone superior to myself?  I'm sure there's a reason you're not with him, perhaps his willingness to accept being shit on with a smile had something to do with it?  
---
I do play mobile games before sleeping, in fact they're Gacha games which revolve 100% around RNG.  I don't spend a penny.  And yet I have many 5 star units, because they have bad luck prevention.  This has nothing to do with pay to win.  I'd slap on One Eyed Mask and go bottom tree striker if my goal was to win.  My K/D would make your beta ex tremble, and the Astrocyte Verse has nothing to do with winning or getting more kills. I simply wanted to have more FUN.  Mobility and blinking is FUN.  Is that not why we all play videogames, to have FUN?  Imagine putting a giant barrier between yourself and FUN, label it RNG and it only lets so many people pass through, yet everyone pays the same price to try and cross the line and experience FUN.  We expect there to be a direct correlation between time in and fun out.  We play videogames to have fun, we don't log in time to roll the dice at a chance of having fun, unless we're your beta ex.
---
This sub is not an lfg
---
quite funny
---
It's a top tier snipe
---
We’ve all been there
---
I'm so happy in the jungle
---
Yeah handheld is THE counter to shotguns. I do like my pulses, my preferred in pve, but hand cannons just feel so final to me, the sound the power the glory. Plus i managed to grind out gear that has all hand cannon, shotgun, and special ammo perks, so i'm pretty set in my ways on hunter.
---
But then you have to use Hardlight..
---
He said “JK” dude... he said “JK”. **pats back**
---
Because the game doesn’t recognize what level we are for loot drops
---
camera just needs to float higher above the warlock casting it
---
Dude I need this right know tell me it’s not that hard to get
---
Uh I use pc but, if you have an option like "repair" do it after you restart your xbox, then restart again. It usually works for me in the blizzard app.
---
Or do the same with "check for updates"
---

Sir, I'm detecting energy signature in that tunnel similiar to one that was generated by unnerfed Gallahorn.

Tiny sparrow has the same hitbox as other sparrows, it's just invisible, try running into a wall and you'll see.
---
Well, bungie trying to avoid a pay to win scenario I see
---
[deleted]
---
Just a quick question are the glows an attachment like the pervious solstice or are they locked in
---
Don't worry
---
I dont give a fck on pvp must-do quests... One reason why i dont have even Ace 😂
---
It's possible to upgrade armor already now? Like from green&gt;blue&gt;purple, or we need wait on some kind reset, quests after next tuesday?
---
If somebody have time to farm all steps in all pieces of armory it's possible to reach "legendary" form already?
---
Thank you, Kowalski
---
Wait what shotgun is that it looks dope
---
I just like well of radiance in general.   I tried to kill a supering hunter with it, by landing the blade on his head. I dont remember what hunter super, they have too many.
---
Unfortunately I don’t think we have any options like that on Xbox
---
Always On Time
---
Roaming supers are getting a nerf in crucible when shadow keep comes out
---
I liked to use the shovel emote before it got confiscated this patch. =)
---
This I agree. We got them one time why would we need to buy another set !
---
Range finder opening shot is god roll
---
Wardcliff Coil.
---
I went with void so far... probably gonna invest into solar eventually
---
I REALLY ENJOYED PLAYING MY PART ON THESE POSTS ARAD!!!
---
Enemy 1/28 defeated
---
I had that happen too exit the game and restart it
---
I don't know how, but I think it will. I'm pretty sure it is not worth it to develop such an area just for a one month event ;)
---
Should be able to dock the two together and make it a sidecar.
---
Scooty puff senior 
---
Or alternatively, Scooty puff requiem
---
Yes, don't beat yourself up now and get to afking forges so you can  buy it back quickly.
---
Nice shot!!
---
oof
---
Figured as much, I don’t have a group to really play with and I wanted that bad Juju
---
Do the dudes at the start of the leviathan raid count?
---
Daddy_Clan. Do it
---
ROCK SPOOK
---
Wow I thought that I was grinding but i guess
---
Nice one. I played last night for a couple of hours when the update came on and just need to play some strikes and crucible matches to get to stage 2. Then the grind is on fpr majestic. I don't know if i can even be bothered to do it on titan and hunter but titan looks so good, especially with thr void ornament.
---
Dis you just forget that enhanced perks are a thing, and they can only be acquired through endgame activities? Why would I settle for normal perks when I can get an enhanced version of them?
---
Nope. You want bottom tree golden gun while wearing Celestial nighthawk helmet. But...
---
If you're wearing a few pieces of gear with Transcendent Blessing mods on it, or if you've been diligent enough to acquire a full set with those mods, then generally whatever super you use is gonna do very significant damage.
---
 Best way is just to sweep the 3 knights, you use your heavy guns, your grenades, and your partner busts their super out and you both crush all 3 knights. Use thunderlords for heavy and you can shred the adds fast, time's of the essence. If you're wearing a full set of gear with Transcendent Blessing mods on it, forget any extra steps like having your Titan partner use melting point or tractor cannon. Just golden gun that vile bitch in the face and you're gravy.
---
Worth the watch to the end
---
Yup, sold them on ebay for like $25 though
---
My corneas been burneddd
---
Yeah i cant wait to sleep and eat... And every thing else again
---
Why would anybody ever want it back it was that 1 gun that literally made it impossible to raid if you didnt have it and of they bring of back nerfed nobody will want to use it because it wont be the same and they sure as hell wont bring it back like it was in d1
---
Someone do an edit but with crazy frog playing in the background
---
Poor him! he was so clise to the 50 killstreak
---
You achieve what you set your mind too.
---
aushwitz v2 for them
---
No loot. Just armor. Grind a bunch of silly tasks to update said armor.
---
There's a reason that matchmaking exists in games with multiplayer. Not everyone has three or more friends that can play with them whenever they need to go in the crucible for something. Fecking donut.
---
EAZ map is really good but rewards are pitiful at best: random piece of non powerful legendary or rare gear and 5 pieces of a random resource.
---
Obviously you get the solstice armour but the steps to upgrade them are really grindy.
---
Valor reset. My friends told me it would come up so i saved it last week
---
I was using a Velos Knight from Osiris bc it rolled 160 and with the perk I wanted. I too am just using Scooty-Puff Jr now lol did the second part of Scourge last night using it- highly recommend.
---
Do robots have an afterlife?
---
Wow, you resurrected the heck outta this thread just to whine about matchmaking because you lack social skills and friends?
---
GG. Big guy. GG.
---
Using DIM, add the filter "source:Eververse", displays all items that dismantle into bright dust. You can also do her bounties
---
Also feels like it has a tighter turn radius
---
Check the audio settings in game and also check the Windows audio mixer settings. The game may be muted/vol level 0 in one or both.
---
dat ass tho
---
Is the only way to get the glows to spend 5000 bright dust for a whole element set?
---
Yeah im taking the post down lol
---
Yep,right here. ~50 LW clears and still haven’t gotten it.
---
Gambit orbs are broken right now so you have to do that step in crucible unless you want to wait for them to patch it
---
I ended up doing this during Crimson Days. Best decision ever. It's a whole lot easier to win a 2v1 than a 1v3. Not to mention the mode forces you to stick with your teammate in order to do well.
---
I saw a post yesterday on the subreddit, but i can't find it anymore. I'll post a link if find it again
---
I never said I don't care about your opinion. Also, if you don't care about mine, then why are you even here? Not exactly making much sense.
---
To be fair you did peak just there
---
It doesn't work in comp or prime fwi
---
it doesn't work in prime so if you're trying there it won't work. has to be normal gambit
---
Thanks.  Not like this emblem will change my life, but since they offered and I played quite a bit of Cruci during that time, it will be nice to have.
---
Prestige ?
---
I think you probably have to complete the Red War campaign and get access to the Tower social space to participate.
---
God drang it.
---
I bet anyone having a conversation with you is really painful.
---
What is Prestige? If you mean Gambit Prime, you're in the wrong mode. Just do normal Gambit.
---
I found a post at the Destiny help page that said it'll release later this week.
---
Player level 50
---
10 kills even for the worst person at crucible wouldn't take more than 2-3 quick play matches. I would hope.  
---
what load out are you using? what are some weapons you have? I will try and get you setup for crucible the best I can.
---
I'll keep you updated on that one
---
If I get above 700 before the majestic set do you think it would be power 700?
---
The only thing missing is someone with the Jazz Hands emote!!
---
lol, imagine 200 more crucible grenade kills after the iron banner grind.
---

You don’t have to say that, I know you don’t. The title of this post literally imply that this, gun, that I and many others believes to be trash, is supposedly not trash. Meaning you do not care about people thinking this gun is trash and you think it’s not trash.
---
The reason I’m here was also stated in my previous post. To defend the fact that it’s trash
---
&gt;Gjallarhorn but its a kinetic handcannon
---
Ftfy
---
Good. Supers can be overpowered or supers can be easy to use. They should not be both though.
---
I would just throw dreg..
---
i will never get tired of the tiny sparrow
---
play regular gambit, it works totally fine there
---
Na I type like this only in arguments coz it trips people up and they don’t read properly and end up contradicting themselves, which I almost did
---
What platform you are on?
---
the grind is real, on blue armor for warlock now, kill 75 guardians with solar stuff. damnit, i thought i could put down LoW and jotunn after iron banana, clearly i was wrong
---
Just because I don't think it's trash doesn't mean I don't care about people that do think it's trash. You know next to nothing about me, so don't start assuming things about the way I think.
---
Yeah lmao, screw that bs😂 i had to deal with OEM losers all week not tryna have flashbacks.
---
Took me 93 chests to get that dam thing... just two weeks ago actually
---
post like these make me appreciate my taste in humor
---
How long does that take?
---
You should only do two anarchy shots. The damage caps at two per target and is just a waste of ammo if you do three.
---
It's so much better like..... Fuuuck. But I digress.
---
I think you replied to the wrong person sir, just wanted to give you a heads up so the information reaches the right person!
---
Yup. Remember one thing if you are new. Game lives with lore. Main campaing is more like tutorial. Without good lore destiny would be like anthem. Fine shooting and stuff but after some time it would start to bore people.
---
Aka "I just want Bungie to give things to me without earning them"
---
I guess I don't understand why you think they would take a piece from old content and do something different with it?
---
There has been no talk of this, no mention of it from developers, no users asking for this to be done.
---
Bottom line is, no they have not said anything about changing the subclasses in any way, and I am not sure why you thought they would.
---
AC/DC, thanks for a good music option
---
most of it seems grindy as hell, I may not even try for the 200k nightfall and masterworking gear doesn't really feel like anything.
---
I just recorded it
---
I attempted to add you. your GT Xaxhi was not found... join clan Pure id be more than happy to raid with you we do raids Friday nights 8pm pst / 11 EST. Willing to teach any raid you want.
---
Yeah. Rose in the middle and instead of a fan have them pointing up and fanning left and right
---
This was a whole struggle, especially timing certain parts
---
Just FYI, Bungie employees don't really answer questions here.
---
This is just worded like you actually think they are going to come here and give you a direct answer. Just don't want you to get your hopes up.
---
I don't have enough time to focus on 3 characters, so I just focus on 1, and I'm more than happy with that option. I did put quite a few hours 100+ PL 560 or so into my Warlock, but I solely play my hunter now. Instead of worrying about leveling all 3 classes, I just focus on raiding, end game stuff, triumphs, collections on 1 character and it's so much more clean, smooth, and comfortable for me. Just having one character is amazing.
---
I really do see what you have against me wanting them to make the planets better and more viable for us who has finished the game and to also increase the rewards so that it isn't totally useless, But then sit here and say that the planets are not good for endgame players and that the rewards are not good enough for us. Don't you see that you are literally proving my points ? I am sitting here and saying that they should improve the planets and you are arguing that they are not good, Don't you see the irony here ?
---
I want them to make them better so that i don't have to sit and play strikes,gambit,pvp,menagerie and raids (i don't play raids) it gets boring and repetitive after awhile. So with your logic the new shadowkeep planet is an unnecessary addition because planets are bad and no one wants to play on them ? and that they should just add a new raid and some exotics instead ?
---
It is probably because people like you that the planets are bad, cuz all you do is just to sit there and say that the planets are shit and yet not wanting them improved.
---
Only the best
---
So..... Get to lvl 50.  It's a grind but missioms give about half a level. As does the crucible.  Play crucible so you can hang when an eneveta let exotic quest pits you against your fellow sweaty guardians.   Figure out what you like to do, whether it be strikes or raids or Gambit or crucible.  And get good at doing that.  Learn good rolls for weapons.  Get your exotic quests done.  And find a solid group of people to play with.  Honestly you'll find damn good players in the crucible.  And even better players in large clans.   Ask any other questions you have in this thread :)
---
The back of the classroom
---
Nice well done
---
There is no shadestep anymore. The Dodge is what you get now. You can go invis with one of the nightstalker trees (I think top tree?) after a dodge, but there is no stock "shadestep" ability now.
---
At least there's less crucible though. As someone who doesn't like crucible or gambit that first set was brutal.
---
Dynamite tho
---
I can either go for the sparrow or save for the glow...
---
Yeah it fucking sucks and is disorientating
---
I just got Vespulaser and I'm ridiculously happy with it - looooove the Warmind look. 
---
I really want this too, though. I want my Titan to rock the Sparrow equivalent of a tricycle.
---
I miss doubles. Did mine that week like you did, and I loved that gamemode.
---
Did this give you protect the runner or did you already have it?
---
every fucking time... every time i swear to you.. even if im one shot and i know my ass is about to be blue boi goo i still punch those fucking thrall and those fucking skreebs.
---
Don't make posts like this? I block people that make posts like this.
---
Why don't you put in some effort and come to us with specific questions that you have? Or areas that you feel you need tips on (staying alive/builds/etc.)
---
Just coming in with this open ended a question makes me want to block you because it just sounds like you know nothing and want people to do an essay for you on what the game is all about and every little thing you should be doing.
---
The game is too big to ask for general advice like this. Come back with more specific, directed questions and we can help.
---
I rather earn them then just being handed them, but hey that's just me.
---
I’ll panic melee them sometimes
---
This as well.  Lore is massive.  'my name is byf' is the reason I love destiny.  His time and effort show how much though is put into the backstory of destiny
---
How’d it go?
---
Can you please quit being a douche canoe.
---
I do like conversating with people like this and to learn from each other, so i don't feel like this is a waste of time, more of a little break.
---
Thanks for the tip. You’re a real delight.
---
No I know, I'm talking more of the animation rather than the ability, in D1 you did a dive but in D2 you do a side dodge thing. I've seen people do the dive version and I'm wondering how to use that one.
---
Can you apply shaders or no?
---
Yes you can and a lot of them look really nice!
---
I personally recommend Polaris lance, it’s not too bad especially if you’re on a roof and facing enemies that don’t move constantly
---
I’ve done a lot of it solo. You don’t need wins so it’s pretty fine
---
Oh i did something hard and tedious so others people problems are nothing compared to mine. Grow up kiddo
---
Ty, just to be sure, I'm playing while the mode is free since i don't have the dlcs and couldn't figure out why I kept loosing while invading.   
---
I'm sorry to hear this is another paywall feature behind dlcs even if you have forsaken.
---
What phase is best to try to trigger the heroic event (1st, 2nd or 3rd).  Does damage carry over between phases or is the dmg needed just less each phase? (or both)
---
Honestly Man. That quest is all about patience and time.   Use fighting lion or the colony.  And don't do quickplay.  Hope Into comp or the 4v4 modes that rotate weekly.  Don't be super agressive either.  Gotta be alive for those three kills to count.  What class do you main?
---
Hey man sometimes hunters melee ability is jank and stabs instead of chucks
---
What?!?
---
You only have to Masterwork 1 piece of armor for the Title/Triumph ya goofball.
---
Do you know if you can buy each glow and if they stay after the event.
---
We're you high when you wrote this. Jesus.
---
Arcstrider problems but no gunslinger problems.
---
The boots, I just had to apply the masterwork by inspecting the boots after the objective was completed :)
---
Then dont do it 😭. Everyone you see that has it endured the same grind. Just buck up man
---
If I have to do Savathun's Song one...JUST ONE MORE TIME.....
---
Does Bungie have something against Japanese girls, with this groundhog scenario of having Taeko die and there not being any way to save her?
---
No idea, I can’t decipher what it says either
---
It looks like he ate half of sentences. And this what remained got placed in random places...
---
thats because u/kryppo thankfully already explained it
---
lol fucking adorable
---
Nerfing the well for warlock would make warlock almost useless as a support character. There would be no point in taking a warlock into a raid at that point.
---
BRING ME THE EYES
---
So fucking valid fr dude
---
Amen
---
PC.  
---
Please. You can gain and use more skill and mobility and frame rate matter when shit gets sweaty in a raid or pvp
---
Iv not long got fully addicted to the game and didnt know about level advantages with invading. Iv been actively invading alot more lately usually coming out with a few kills each time.i wonder whether knowing this will have a placebo effect
---
When i got past the first stage it felt pretty good. Finally get to equip glow. Then i looked at the requirements to get to the final stage and it seemed pretty daunting. An hour on titan has already got me a good chunk on a couple of pieces so it is definitely doable over a month. If this was like iron banner and only lasted a week i would hate it but there's plenty of time to do it so that's a plus. When the update first launched i said that i was going to do it on all three classes, now i know that it will be tough for someone like me who likes to take breaks.
---
 I have come to accept that doing it on all three characters will be the grind to end all grinds so now I've set my target of just doing it for my warlock who i play as 90% of the time. At least then i will feel like i achieved something at the end of the event without feeling too burnt out on the game. I already know that it's probably going to take me at least a few days to get the armour from renewed to majestic but that's ok because i think it will be completely worth it.
---
 It isn't just about the fact that it is some of the bes looking armour in the game even without the glow, it's also the fact that this will be the first 2.0 set. When we look back on destiny 2 in five years time, we can say that we were there during the solstice event and got the first set of armour that used the new system and it looked fantastic.
---
In the end, the void sparrow probably isn't even worth it when we can already get tiny sparrow and while it would be nice to have the armour for all three classes, it is probably more realistic for most of us to just get it for our mains and if we have time, perhaps our second favourite. I personally adore the new titan set but my warlock is my number one priority. My titan is my second most played so if i have time i will try to get it for him as well but if i just do it for my main i will be happy.
---
I know the grind is real but we have a month to do it and i think it is an important set to get. I guarantee that anyone taking part will have at least one set done by time it's over and one set is all you need. Worst part of getting from renewed to majestic for me is the 100 miniboss kills and the 200 arc super kills in crucible because i suck at crucible. But it will be done and for anyone else out there feeling the pain of the grind, keep going. You will get there eventually and i have a feeling that it will be completely worth it. 
---
Good luck, god speed.
---
Holy shit, that’s when I spam b to roll
---
For me it’s always with ballistic slam because if you aim *just right* you can be out of range of death. But I’m not that careful
---
The first year of destiny is going free to play so that's what you will get with shadowkeep but the complete edition comes with forsaken and the annual pass so all of year 2. It depends on if you want to play that content or not.
---
When people don't even bother re-reading what they typed before posting.... You get this. 
---
I am honestly saddened every time I see someone use THIS little effort on a post. 
---
Its like they don't even care if they get it right.
---
Plus PC needs more new players.  PC tends to be a better clan environment and hand cannons are FANTASTIC on PC
---
That’s like the easiest part honestly. I’m stuck at Pulse rifle precision kills
---
Pre firing a corner is better than camping a corner with a shotgun/LOW. Would much rather fight him/her than one of those crouching in corners with shotguns
---
Theres 3 big ol blights that appear after each wave, one for each direction. They're a little further down the lane so you may have missed them, but if you break all 3 the heroic will start if the generator survives.
---
Right now I’m running a last word a bad reputation which I think I got a pretty decent roll on and I think a Zenobia-D
---
Seems a bit toxic tbh, like I’m with you getting shoulder charged and bottom tree striker sucks but I mean give them a break, they’re just a class
---
Your good man
---
My best guess is the title
---
That’s the thing It would match up with the pc version I have (truthfully the only cost I ever paid was forsaken and the pass), but I’d then be behind on getting shadow keep but that’s also a month and a half away. I’m only power level 164 so I don’t even know if if I’ve touched anything that’s in forsaken yet.
---
r/whoosh
---
Doing reckoning to get a full set of Notorious gear for the Triumph was the most painstaking experience that I have ever had in Destiny as a franchise. It’s just not fun, and there’s no guarantee on what piece you receive at the end. Along with the fact that no one wanted to do it more than the minimum 4 runs for the weekly challenge.
---
You can buy the glows for 5k bright dust or 800 silver, and they definitely should stay after the event!
---
I bought an emote recently now I’m working my ass off doing bounties to get more bright dust lol
---
Lmfao
---
&gt; I wish they spawned in gambit prime, normal gambit takes so long.
---
Didn't people complain way back because those effects were active in comp? Gambit Prime is "sort of" the competitive version of Gambit, so I can understand why the orbs weren't enabled.
---
[excuse me what the fuck](http://imgur.com/gallery/AVOAqxr) kind of quest is that?
---
Maybe it’s trying to force you out because you cheat?
---
Bye!
---
MIDA is currently still good. Check out Aztecross video on scouts he explains it really well. It’s typically the fact that rn there aren’t too many fast firing hard hitting scouts that keep up with the current chaperone hand cannon recluse meta
---
Ah you’re right, I always forget Gambit Prime is the equivalent to Comp but for Gambit.
---
Yea the only way is they have played nonstop and are great in the crumble
---
40!? Duplicates!? Wow. Are you going to keep playing and try and get those exotics you don’t have? Nope
---
Hey man sometimes warlock brain ability is jank and melees instead of shoots
---
Oh. Okay.
---
When I’m playing my arc titan with 10 resilience  I don’t even die sometimes!
---
Difference is, you can forge farm without ruining other peoples experience
---
Sounds like the PC might be overheating or something. I'd imagine it was just a problem with destiny, the game would most likely just crash and take you to the desktop but in this case your entire computer restarts.
---
I’ve watched it but I’ve just always been of the opinion that map design is the biggest hindrance to scout rifles in the current meta
---
Kills I believe.
---
Super kills?
---
If you inspect the peace the description is at the top
---
Thanks
---
Just happened to stumble across this, I'm xbox and I like to think I'm decent at comp on a good day, kd is 1.13 so not terrible
---
It's fun running titan and throwing up a wall
---
But I gotta get to those motes first!
---
My favorite kind.
---
Make sure your graphics drivers are up to date, if they are try to reinstall them
---
Load solo nightfall of your choice with void singe and grenadier. 
---
Equip weapons with demolitionist. 
---
Toss on Frostees. 
---
Also use tethers to tie enemies together and regen grenade. 
---
Could pick a nightfall with a lost sector near the start.
---
Especially since you can retrieve blue items using the companion app. Do it travelling between planets..
---
Titan brain working properly when melee instead of shoot.
---
[*drops Well of Radiance*]
---
[*dances in it while being meleed by Thrall who are now powerless to stop me*]
---
Ah, thank you
---
Now it’s solstice key powder inside
---
I ran that build for a long time and I still panic melee because of it
---
Hint: Warlock with Lunafactions (well or rift, either way) or Titan with Rallying Barricade JUST at the edge of a Blight, and a fast firing SMG or auto. Think back in D1, Titan bubbles with Weapons of Light where you'd just stand at the edge (or keep walking in and out / stand on a tall box so half of you sticks out). If you're in the right spot you'll always have the buff and the benefit of the barricade or Luna rift
---
Warlock is fun imo probably the best in regards to jump and the pure power
---
I’m going to take a guess and think that someone is trolling by powering down then powering back up and keeping the session going on long enough so they get kicked. Happened to me the first time I tried it.
---
Listen here fucking scum, I want you to explain how 4 guys AFKing in a team overnight in Gambit ruins the experience.  We were handing free wins to the opponents.
---
This is so different from DDoSing people, I can't even start to comprehend how little your brain is working right now.  My teammates were other AFKers who didn't care if they won or lost.  Fucking greasy dumbass.
---
It's not hard but if one guy tries to teach 2 new guys something and rest 3 are rambling you teach nothing.
---
You are probably doing the wrong adventure. Be sure you aren't doing the heroic adventures that appear on Titan due to it being the flashpoint, and that you're doing the one for this quest. Hover over the adventure flags on the map and read descriptions to see.
---
kill him he is using service revolver
---
LOL as if I've never shot aliens with it.... it's OKAY at best
---
Clearly the fastest ttk vs another guardian,  but it's nothing in pve unless you're killing low level enemies.
---
Me too man! I got a god roll for PVE, managed to get grave robber &amp; amped mag it’s an absolute beast!
---
Sure
---
The items sold for bright dust rotate every week. Which items it is will be random. 
---
Eververse loot pool does not rotate out until the end of the season. This means things in the Eververse, such as the current Eververse armor set, are there for a whole season.
---
Its a seperate adventure, dont get it confused with the flash point
---
So likely it was a fluke
---
PS - Here's a list of things that ruined the gambit playlist:
---
\- Allowing armors to be swapped during matches
---
\- Breakneck Quest
---
\- Hush Quest
---
\- The myriad of weekly and daily quests which involve rewarding players for playing non-optimally
---
\- Armament mods
---
\- Drop rates so piss poor that even players with thousands of hours and a Dredgen title decide to AFK out of desparation
---
Dumbass
---
And I thought I was good with 18k kills on mine :(
---
Got it within 24 hours... (don't be me...hahhaa)
---
Take it into the shuro chi or crown of sorrows, or just ask some people in the D2 LFG. They will say the same thing I'm saying.
---
Sorry. I don’t believe a word from you. You were probably alone. Ruining teams chances to win. Did your other buddies get banned? Probably not because you’re a lying cheat. 
---
One of the bases for your argument was that solo queuing gambit players weren’t trying to win and that makes it hard for you. Why would that be a problem if you have a full fireteam? 
---
Your story is full of holes. Just like your brain.
---
The only quest on titan i have right now is the last word one.
---
As in DDLG. If I said Little Girl by itself, a lot of people would assume I was talking about actual little girls.
---
ok ty
---
"Too" not "to"
---
This is an actual objective fact, there's no excuse for stupidity
---
After seeing the soltice trailer, i just couldn't contain myself hahahaha... Ah well. Happy Solstice!
---
Cheating? How the fuck is going AFK cheating?  Are people cheating when they have to use the bathroom or check on their kids during a match?  Are they cheating when a thunderstorm knocks out their internet?
---
DDoSing is cheating.  You're a fucking dumbass
---
Let me carry more than 9 weapons/armour pieces per slot. 
---
Praise be for DIM though.
---
Shoutout to the two other people who also play warlock :(
---
damn bergusia servitors
---
No, And orbs don’t spawn in gambit prime as well.
---
Are you saying you only have one adventure marker (orange map icon)? There should be at least two.
---
Ally kills count for one step. The one where you need to kill guardians with specific element weapons.
---
Breakneck Quest: easy
---
Hush: easy
---
Changing armor: just how the game works
---
You: banned cheating loser
---
Look on the D2 app instead of being a fucking idiot, you'll see organized groups for AFK gambit prime every night.  
---
&gt; One of the bases for your argument was that solo queuing gambit players weren’t trying to win and that makes it hard for you. Why would that be a problem if you have a full fireteam? 
---
Goddamn you're fucking stupid.  I was tired of solo queing and being the only one banking motes and shooting at the envoys/primeval.  So I AFK G Prime in a 4 stack to avoid ruining the experience for anyone else.
---
Are you that wrapped up in your moral boner that all you can do now is deny the facts I'm presenting you?  Are you that fucking hell bent on pointing a finger, that you can't twist your greasy digit around to point at your own dumb ass for being fucking stupid?
---
You're not wrong. Recluse is far too strong for how easy it is to use.
---
ILL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK
---
The amount of times I've said fuckit and punched a skreeb swarm is very high...
---
Which console
---
fair nuff
---
*gets notorious collector boots 4 times in a row while missing the bond*
---
Holy goddamn mother fucking hell you're actually brainless.  Enjoy your pathetic, short, greasy life.
---
lol casuals
---
its still a shotgun.
---
[Awaken, my masters!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yvsJn9Ncsk)
---
Take of video of u playing and post it on r/crucibleplaybook they help alot of ppl
---
hit me up on ps4
---
\-CocoaBoy3000
---
Uhhhh that step doesnt have to be in crucible friend
---
Unless you’re out in the open with Marksman’s dodge. Then it’s just a desperate attempt to survive a little longer.
---
I love everything you just said.
---
Stability is good only for fast shooting guns/lmg's
---
With rest guns if you have problem to handle few fallen or even worse cabal then well... Ged gud?
---
Dude  one grenade can kill more ads faster, not to mention if warlocks are doing their job everyone has unlimited ammo anyway, get your shit together maybe not everyone's playstyle and setup are the same, and depending on who you are some weapons are more effective,  I can literally just hold the trigger down and fire any gun indefinitely whenever I want, and yes there are better guns for pve than recluse, hell unlimited thunderlord is pretty fun, maybe play the game rather than worry about some asshole you saw on YouTube.
---
PS - I bet you were beat up a lot in school.  Hard to be one of the cool kids when you blindly follow all the ruuuuuuuuules
---
Rubber banding?
---
Calling it "sever" is an overstatement. There are lots of weapons that aren't exotic that you can use for ad clear, not as efficient, but by no means do they put you at a disadvantage. The real problem with pve is stuff like well of radiance, that's what puts you at a disadvantage if you dont have it
---
Middle tree is definitely the best
---
Once you get the legendary solstice armor, those armor pieces with different perks can drop from the solstice packages.
---
Honestly
---
Alternatively, like OP’s picture, if eight bullets fire and nobody hits anything, that whole team should be ashamed.
---
Lately it feels like everyone uses a sniper and deathballs, and someone has to die. And whoever gets the kill thinks they’re a god, but someone was going to hit the shot out of the 4-6 teammates all aiming at the same guy.
---
you know if it as anything to do with destroying that solar crystal ?
---
I am speed
---
I main Titan but I'm trying it out with the hunter
---
I am aware that the "severe disadvantage" statement has not aged well.
---
I don’t think recluse will get nerfed, it’s not exactly Op, just good situationally. I use it way more in PvE than PvP to be honest.
---
BIG F
---
I don’t believe so they just give you an orb boost I think
---
So you can get back from collections is what you're saying?
---
When you waste all your ammo killing one Minotaur because it keeps teleporting
---
I got mine on Sunday, so tell me brother, what're your thoughts on it
---
Ok, thanks alot 😊
---
same but looks cool :D
---
So I’m guessing it’s best to just hold on to them for now, correct?
---
That's the only thing I'll be able to afford this damn event since there is no freaking event engram
---
Damn, very impressive. Just curious, if you had to rank them in order of easiest to hardest, how would it go?
---
Screw these quest steps Gambit is fun but since I have to play it it's so dreadful
---
Personal opinion but titans look awfull when they are female.
---
Helmet +3 only Drops if you the helmet Upgrade up to 3 from driftet bounties.  It wont drop in rekon
---
I’m using Sunshot because the catalyst drop recently. The second part of it sucks.
---
Needs that Benny Hill music
---
Unless you're low on cores, but yeah, I 'd just save them for later otherwise.
---
Go through the bus that is next to the building
---
You’re right though. If you don’t mind the draw speed, you can get a better subtle calamity. If you do, an Arsenic Bite can still 1-shot and can roll regular Archer’s Tempo, which doesn’t require hipfire, and basically matches the draw speed. Plus you can get rampage or explosive tips, I think even Dragonfly on either Arsenic or Subtle Calamity, putting them that much further above Hush.
---
and land arc super final blows on opposing guardians in the crucible or gambit
---
Isn’t that one on a floating island?
---
Is he really complaining about a chest in the EAZ? I somewhat understand crucible hate mail but wow lol.
---
