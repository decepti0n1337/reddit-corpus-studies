I'm usually the guy clearing the blockers so people can bank
---
---
---
No yeah for sure thats the impression i had from the first one and figured it would be more or less the same thing for this one as well, having to pay for multiplayer is just bleh
---
You can get 88 from armor in the season pass. Comes at 66
---
Yes, Titans are special, but Saint-14 is something else
---
I'll do you one better, make it based on your performance the previous match. That way it's something you "earn" but it doesn't favor no lifers
---
just venting, sorry, trying not to be mean
---
Wait what!
---
Please trim your videos
---
Try a different character maybe? Idk what to tell you
---
Appreciate it, bud
---
[deleted]
---
Eh. I use a cheap Corsair one I got for free, but it doesn't matter too much. 
---

---
Just make sure it's big enough to be able to control recoil and move your arm kinda thing. Some people like the full mats too
---
Hard mouse pad vs cloth/soft is a thing too. I have always used cloth, I don't think it makes too much difference
---
It cost you 0 dollars to say that but you did anyway.
---
I have a   66 base chest piece
---
RNG
---
what about the dreaming city? Or a couple spots on Nessus
---
This actually made me laugh out loud, lmao
---
Ghost parks it.
---
Hunters are plebs
---
Do you think the blue light around a ghost when a guardian is down might be their form of protection? Perhaps a round of a weapon of sorrow would be enough to penetrate it, if it were protective
---
I seriously don't get why people shit on Zavala, he's a cool character and he's a good leader. People started hating on him because forsaken and all I can say is that he was handled it the best way he could so the city wouldn't be in danger.
---
Isn‚Äôt ‚Äô it an exotic quest after enhance? Or is that just sturm.
---
Ok I'll keep this in mind!
---
Unless I'm imagining things
---
üò≥
---
Enjoy!
---
I put forth effort. I just suck and dont have a lot of time to play.
---
I know right? You can do a hc frame there in just two runs
---
I get ya my guy, I spent so long farming an outlast it hurts.
---
The main reason they probably don‚Äôt have a higher or guaranteed drop chance is because, like you said they didn‚Äôt want people playing prime for grinding out those weapons. Spare is (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) dropped on both weekly rotations so you would have a much easier time in reckoning.
---
Th3Jez is just joking around about it. In pvp, it is horrible but in pve the fun is solid
---
I believe next reset he will be under the Scarlet Keep entrance in Sorrow's Harbor. Hope that answer's your question! Good luck on Harbinger!
---
I know it is, its just hunters feel a bit over the edge, not by much though. And how does this meme imply I don't read the patch notes might I add?
---
Barge is very noticeable if you're in the right area, it's in the top right section of the map. I'm pretty sure only Iron Banner and the Trials labs are power based.
---
I usually play invader and I've won matches where my motes and primeval damage look like that, granted I usually have a few more guardian kills than that
---
I haven't unlocked mine yet, but my son fast travels and then can usually access it
---
Ah ok, thanks for the info
---
Its a pretty standard sniper rifle, with niche applications in high level nightfalls with the Matchgame modifier. 
---
Not really worth the exotic slot.
---
Woah woah woah... which smg is this ?
---
Not Forgotten.
---
that happened to me i just keep going back to orbit and re trying till it eventually allowed me to access it hope this helps.
---
You mean keep increasing rank and they may/may not drop as a reward from the engram?
---
I've tried this many times I still cant use it
---
Normal crucible games do not have LL advantage, what weapons are you trying to use?
---
Shit on some kids in PvP
---
Is this Pc? If it is then it doesnt matter, there is no recoil in PC at all
---
\&gt;Weighted knives have aim assist  
---
"Does he even play hunter...?"  
---
Oh Just saw the flair. Never mind.
---
Ah! That's hawt!
---
my most powerful weapons are the Origin Story and the Ikelos hand cannon
---
*Friendly ghost.
---
He's a special crayon
---
Randy's, that shit komodo, revoker
---
The memories.
---
Wow. Impressive.
---
It's annoying.  Just keep respawning until it works. That's all you can do
---
Yup
---
HHS?
---
Grind for god rolls of seasonal weapons since they won‚Äôt be around forever
---
I don't have access and I'm getting sick of these glitches
---
Uhh ghost in the night is 6 kills without receiving damage.
---
I really hope the next 85 drops you get are all edge transit.
---
I tried that many times but I'm now trying to go to orbit and see if that works
---
It was shin.
---
I think it's hard truths
---
This is my Hard Truths with Stability masterwork, Zen Moment and Flared Magwell, plus a Recoil mod. As a reminder, Agressive frame SMG got a 0.6 TTK
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Cold Front, for comparison : Has a better range, a better stability, a better handling, a better aim assist, and a better recoil (enough to no use a Recoil mod). It only has a worse reload speed. It can roll with Zen Moment just as Hard Truths in the first column, but also get Vorpal Weapon or Rangefinder in the seoncd column (or Kill Clip / Dynamic Sway Reduction, just as Hard Truths). It also uses Barrel perks instead of Sights, so you can roll a Cold Front with Recoil or Stability stats. And if you don't care about range, it can roll with Steady Rounds.
---
So yeah, I know those MAY seem hard to control, especilly on console. But trust me, low stability on paper, doesn't mean it's terrible. Just a few perks, and you're good to go, these SMGs are amazing.
---
And I thought gta had the most glitches in the game
---
Did ever use the mod ‚Äúenhanced linear fusion rifle tracking‚Äù?
---
The lantern gives it out. It made my life alot easier with the tracking and snapshot.
---
That's like tag, but terrifying
---
Monte Carlo implies that the guardian being questioned is lying; I would assume that that particular guardian actually killed his "buddy's" ghost.
---
Oh my god, user lives up to the name if you look at the profile
---
Yes it is, had to explain why I posted this in a comment it took a bit of time sry :D
---
Yeah I actually agree with you on that. If there's anyone we should be roasting it's him not Zavala
---
That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt get undying. Thank god Savior seems like a fun title to chase so far
---
After a bounce, throwing knives aa goes through the roof.
---
r/underratedcomment
---
All right, the origin story is pretty decent, but you will need to try and get mostly headshots. Both weapons are good for short-medium range, so anyone with scout rifles usually can outgun you easily at 30+ meters. Pulse rifles can also usuallu outgun auto rifles at any range, unless you can consistently hit headshots. Which game mode are you trying to play?
---
It is indeed PC, and I'm aware that there is more recoil on console. But it was just to say that a non-existent stability on paper, doesn't mean the weapon will jump everywhere, you just gotta get a few goods perks (here Zen Moment and Flared Magwell, with a Recoil mod to get it vertical)
---
Helmet stays on
---
You must suck ass.
---
They‚Äôre gonna grape you in the mouth!
---
meanwhile warlocks getting nerfs literally every patch
---
the only mods i think would be tbe champion mods
---
satisfying to watch, I grinded mine only on heavy ammo
---
I‚Äôm a hunter (PS4) and can confirm all thrown melees are literally magnetic. If you get near an enemy it will gravity slingshot under their legs into the ceiling. Won‚Äôt ever help you get a hit, will just Yeet it away instead of smoke detonating on the floor at their feet.
---
This dude really out here destroying bubble yourself with pound and swing

Menagerie
---
They didn't us eintelligence, they just waited long enough to brute force the solution. That's the equivalent of a millions chimpanzees at typewriters eventually writing Shakespeare by accident.
---
Just change the time and date on your console before you load into the edz. Solo instance = no glitch
---
What
---
I remember landing 100% head shots and wonder why the precision meter won't go up. That was the first and most frustrating bounty for me.
---
The only reason I don't believe that is that everyone I've talked to had the same people as me, but maybe we're just lucky.
---
What‚Äôs wrong
---
This... isn‚Äôt funny.
---
Crayons are delicious!
---
Plus he tells everyone, they are the best
---
Not only is he the most competent, but he's probably the most humble about it too, using his success to inspire and bring up others.
---
I fucking dislike those buggers. They're annoying in D1 and they're certainly annoying still. &gt;:T
---
I'm about halfway through the season pass armor, so if I unlock the dawning armor now, then finish the season pass, will the ornaments show up in the armor slot in order of acquisition, or do they have a set order?
---
Only way now?
---
Saint-14 takes his helmet off and Shaxx's helmet is underneath.
---
The only way that makes sense lol
---
Just keep doing activities that reward powerful gear and keep the highest level item you own in your inventory (pretty sure that is how that works)
---
Same here but then I found about the campaign missions
---
You have to clean the doorknobs somehow, idiot...
---
Oof
---
You can hit people out of the air and from farther with normal hammers

Kinda feel bad for you I encountered three during my gambit streak.

Very helpful, thanks for the tips
---
I heard him say that Shaxx is much louder now than he used to be.  He sounded bewildered, and it was funny.
---
is there any other way to get this weapon?
---
Not really, if you don't shoulder charge you still have it, you miss your knife that's it, even with 2 if you miss your out for a while
---
Thanks a bunch! And yeah I've tried zero hour a couple of times but I was solo/with someone else that didn't really know how to do it. I looked at a tutorial and got to the spinning blades a bit after the parkour section and ran out of time haha. 
---
Are you on PC? I'd happily shoot you a message if you are. P.s thanks for being kind to a 'fairly' newcomer!
---
Dead by Daylight except all the bad guys are Titan builds.
---
Also stops hobgoblins from going immune and healing wasting everyone's damn time
---
Don't forget to mess up a recipe before masterworking the oven so you can get the Rahool Triumph. You can't make him a botched cookie after you masterwork the oven, since all the recipes become automatic with no slots for selecting ingredients.
---
Ok
---
I think it was season of dawn
---
You asked for my thought then downvoted me? Seems a bit rude
---
Shadowkeep when he turned into a nightmare
---
No, the picture is mirrored.
---
A criminally underrated comment
---
Why did you say that??? I wouldn't have even thought to check posts if you hadn't said something. ;-; I'm scarred for life.
---
Don't the planetary vendor sell 750 gear you can buy for shards?
---
Seeing this, I feel like we need multiplayer finishers now. I'm sure they wouldn't work, but just a thought
---
This is the single greatest thing I have ever seen
---
The hell is this looney toons bullshit?
---
Were you able to retrieve the token? Because my friend has the same problem but they cant pick it up from postmaster.
---
Oh, good idea
---
Anyone else hear AC/DC in their head when watching this??
---
P sure Shaxx and Saint are just two Labradors in armor.
---
Can we add zavala so we can truly define who's the best?
---
Bro everyone knows that playing titan is easy mode.
---
If I ever make a mod, it's going to be Army of Two 3 with Shax and Saint skins.
---
Ewwww that Crimson ornament looks like it's got herpes or sumn
---
How is that toxic in anyway?
---
The only place LoW is toxic is in Crucible because it is kind of broken, although there are many other equally (over) powerful special weapons such as Telesto and Jotunn.
---
The issue isn‚Äôt always people leaving. I‚Äôve been loading into a game before and then get kicked with an error message. Now my team is down a player. The winners should still get the points in that situation, but the team at a disadvantage shouldn‚Äôt lose points or their win streaks.
---
*greek
---
Got my light level up really fast with crucible lol
---
I thought they fixed that.
---
I say add protection to freelance but not normal tho, as it could be abused. If you leave early in freelance you should either lose you‚Äôre entire streak, or lose point back to your last rank up, and let that loss increase each time. Also, if you lose the 2v3 game I can see losing points, just not losing your streak.
---
For all Titans, run Dunemarchers with middle tree Sunbreaker. Your throwing hammer will do chain lightning damage.
---
You're welcome
---
Comrade-14
---
Fun fact: after you deliver the cookie you‚Äôll eventually die from acid air or something if you run around.   Bonus points for shooting riven with a shot gun to see what happens, which is nothing.   Also, there‚Äôs a pole dancing dragon as one of the icons.
---
Bruh this happened to me a while ago and I did all of scourge of the past with past, this game is wacky

NEW CRUCIBLE MODE: ROUND TABLE
---
Protect your VIP from dying. You share lives but only VIP kills deplete them. VIP gets increased health, non VIPs get an increased mobility buff and heal slowly when near their teams VIP. VIP kills create aoe buffs for nearby teammates on a 1-5 kill tier list.
---
*cries in throwing hammer*
---
Goddamn you had to whine didnt you?
---
This is SGA!   I personally didn‚Äôt make that mistake but I can see lots of people doing it.
---
No they are not. The ones from collections are. Ones that drop in the wild are random. I have a shards with a base of 63 and the one from collection is doo doo
---
Oh Shit!
---
He is from the cosmodrome.
---
Im not letting them rest until arbalest is put down
---
No, it would *NOT* be easier than 7th wishing directly to the cookie drop off point.
---
Like the entire campaign of Osiris obsessing to bring back Saint 14? Heh, bungo could bring back cause if they wanted to. And probably will one day.
---
Yeah. We need transmat zones set up in advance to make things like that easier. We can transmat out of our ship obviously, but can‚Äôt just fast travel anywhere. Part of what Shaxx does is send his Redjack teams (including Guardian members) to clear out both Crucible arenas and transmat zones.
---
The game is not really much focused on leveling up, maybe a little more now since you can get bonus power levels by getting certain amounts of experience, but to level up your gear power level, you can just do whatever you want, you will fill up over time, i got back to destiny in the last week of season of undying and just started doing everything i was able to do
---
I personally like crucible, but more to play than to farm, if i wanted to level up i would do strikes/public events with the most amount of bounties i could gather
---
Dreadful technique! You've confused rays with beams! D! Minus! I'd give you an F, but that would only mean having to see you in summer school.
---
Uninstalling the game permanently worked in my case :D
---
Well the META in PVP and PVE are different and it does suck when a weapons nerfed because it effects both like the sleeper in gambit, I feel like they could have done a better job to balance it but I agree I hope something chances with the servers aswell like region lock or dedicated servers
---
That‚Äôs just a symptom of the real problem of nothing being inherently rewarding and having 99% of our gear come from the bounty screen.
---
It's Recluse. OP commented, and it's the only SMG of that shape with the red spider reticle when unscoped.
---
Did the server crash afterwards
---
Wrong.
---
I have no masterwork items, and I tried for 3 hours and haven‚Äôt gotten any pinch of light yet  ü§¶
---
Not me. I‚Äôve been in EDZ  a lot but not doing that emote
---
I mean they're probably easier to kill that way, but still
---
Grind out the recluse, it took me about three hours and it was 100% worth it
---
Riven is definitely more novelty, for sure.
---
Shit, that‚Äôs a watermark
---
Shared wisdom on top of that, too.
---
It still works I can get my light to 574 and only pair with other people who are doing the same thing. The people you were are just inconsiderate and don‚Äôt care about others. Even if they fail the forge they will still get the essence so there is no downside to them
---
Season of the drifter was already full of that stuff, please lay off the cowboy stuff for like 9 months lmao
---
As much as I like the idea of the game mode itself, it's riddled with issues. First of all, why should the enemy team be allowed to invade if their primeval is summoned but the other team isn't even halfway? Why is there no penalty for invading and dying without getting a kill? Why do you always seem to get the most brain-dead teammates possible?
---
Issues run deep the developers don't seem to give a shit.
---
Unfortunately no , reload mw
---
Why people like my comment? ‚Ä¢-‚Ä¢
---
It looks vex related but that's all I got
---
Yup, we surprisingly learned a lot about Dredgen yor and Shin.
---
Also it won‚Äôt make sense with this season since bungie wants to get further with the story of Shadowkeep (we went from SK to S8 and bedauwd of the death of the undying mind we are now fighting in the sundial because Osiris wanted to save Saint)
---
Ikr? Last I checked my dance emote got me a 7th column, it's so broken
---
I remember having the demo of D1, getting my squad of decked out lvl7s and spending forever trying to damage themüòÇ
---
have saint 14 replace saladin for iron banner just for this season?
---
"stop shooting him he's gonna do the th- well you done did it, have fun"
---
Yeah just rng, i have been averaging 3 vex milk per 100 kills
---
Good for Drifter and Ada tho
---
There is a exotic chest armor that does a arc shockwave when put down but that's all it does
---
Spectral Blades, One-Eyed mask, the Last Word. These and a lot more are currently locked behind Forsaken.
---
You don't get it.  TRUE victory comes from ripping a sweet exclusive emote on your opponent's corpse.  Everything else is foreplay.
---
OK. It's the pyramid basically. The pyramid wasn't only affecting the moon after eris awoke it. Nightmares were sent to other planets. Presumably to ensure maximum fear across the system. Or realistically as another incentive for new light players to buy shadowkeep.
---
It seems pretty intentional when it doesn't explode on players, just AI. Also it's available to everyone who plays gambit prime so how is it cancerous to use? We are having a blast and not a single person we've played has sent hate mail, I think you reddit dudes are just too sensitive.
---
If you have the season pass you will get a set of 60+ base total seasonal armor with void element. Aside for that: raids, pit of heresy, iron banner, 950/980 ordeal
---
Top and bottom tree go an extra .5 meters and Ball Lightning just doesn't work against anybody.
---
That makes sense.
---
Right now it‚Äôs good for the dawning event to get finishing touch.
---
The damage is negligible too. Might kill a thrall or two with it
---
Plllllllllease Bungie, don't take him away at the end of this season!
---
yeah that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a god roll. let it vibe in peace
---
Is there a lore card that talks about this
---
I'm not sure. It's just what I picked up running the campaign and watching a few of byfs videos. You could ask on r/DestinyLore
---
Bruh I'm fucking offshore 2/3 of this season, could you help me out?
---
Well duh? Just because the base game is free doesn‚Äôt mean everything should be given away. Then what‚Äôs the incentive to actually buy the DLC if everything in it is given for free? There‚Äôs already so, so much available without having to pay. 
---
That still doesn‚Äôt equal pay to win. It‚Äôs a major DLC and the exotics are random world drops. They are not a micro transactions that you can just spend $10 on whenever and instantly gain an advantage in the game over other people.
---
Love it
---
Bruh
---
First of all, it was confirmed to be a bug ***by the developers themselves*** so screw off with that weak excuse. Second of all, it's a quest weapon, and a particularly lengthy one, that not everyone has. So no, it's not fair game if you don't have it already.
---
I simply think you and your friends are being cancerous by abusive a known bug to win PVP, that's all. If you think that's being sensitive you've got a weak view of the world, lmao
---
Why are you stealing memes
---
It's because morons like OP exist
---
Damm, didn't get my chatterwhite
---
Thought it was my kids yelling at me.
---
So I just started playing again so please don't burn me down for this possible stupid question but why are people still playing the old raid?
---
I thought they did, but I mean that is actually there throwing knife, they miss, well there screwed too
---
why should they not play for the win? stack and use the best stuff? because it's not survival? lol
---
Jesus christ you weren't joking about the warning. I turned on the reddit volume button and forgot i had my phone volume high. I am now very awake.
---
Yup is not like is a f*** sweeping robot. Or some random ffs. Is one of the most important figures, he deserves a video.
---
Its a stereotypical low effort Russian accent that is meant to be cheesy but also kind of memey and endearing to the character.
---
I can see why some consider it pay to win. By buying a season, you have further access to exotics. Also, a lot of the game‚Äôs loot is behind payed DLC. So technically, you do get an advantage by paying in destiny 2, but these examples are understandable considering base Destiny is free now.
---
Tower Hangar
---
Those things were broken and put behind forsaken yeah, but it wasnt an instant win button (well, maybe the infinite spectral bug while it lasted, but that was not an intended feature)
---
Are you sure? There were tons of posts crying about titan roaming melee super. Even few about hunter!
---
But I agree that its easier to counter those if you see them.
---
Dude, chill. It‚Äôs a bug, people are gonna exploit it. And so what if it gives an unfair advantage, Gambit has been and will always be filled with unfair advantages and crutches, so what‚Äôs one more to the list? It‚Äôll be removed eventually, someone may as well have fun abusing while it‚Äôs there. 
---
And no need to make it personal either. What they‚Äôre doing is cheesy, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily reflect someone‚Äôs personality.
---
oh boy, playing the 'snowflake' card...
---
Hunter is the supreme class
---
What will the quest be called?
---
I can't find it
---
I would say that knifes are much better and stronger range melee than warlocks one.
---
Imagine a Titan getting upset about 1 hit Melee deaths üòÇ
---
But then how is he supposed to get his fill of attention for the day if he doesnt call things HE doesnt like trash?
---
How many obeliscs do u need
---
Ah OK thanks
---
I know, and I want to see the video, I want the quest, but somehow I haven't had either, he just teleported into my tower. I can take quests from him and stuff.
---
you only need to link the tangled shore one and go back to him
---
some of forsaken DLC exclusive weapons can definitely make the game easier but if player is good enough he still can do some crazy stuff with only base game weapons, so yeah, brain has been forgotten
---
Its not the ohk, its dodging the knife and it still kills me
---
Can‚Äôt rest if they don‚Äôt let us save cayde with osiris Time machine ...
---
good one. keep it. got an outlaw rampage with corkscrew and high cal. my main weapon when i'm not using nagi burden or patron with unstoppable rounds
---
OK what is the quest called
---
then he'll give ya 2 quests, i haven't completed them yet but my friend said he give you more quests and you'll go save Saint
---
If I could get d1 levels of warlock fashion Id never be off thr class..... and maybe a melee speed boost.
---
You do realize you should probably delete this thread and repost it with a spoiler warning? This could potentially piss off a lot of people even if its purely speculation.
---
I sure as hell don't want to watch that video.
---
Yes, but I've never dodge a handheld supernova and it still killed me.
---
Same here what next Clyde and Speaker will appear to? Without a proper thing.
---
I've never played d1 but it is interesting how similar the ui looks compared to d2. Maybe missing the super subclass icon and another square but otherwise near the same
---
All I remember is that he has like 2 quests where one is getting like 100 shotgun kills and I think 20ish melee kills.
---
Its a fairly lengthy quest line
---
Oh, you just mean aim assist, yeah as a hunter main, it's a little much, honestly they should tone it down by, like 5 percent or something ya know, at least in pvp
---
Nobody had it. Previous season artifact just vanished. You have same chance and opportunity as everybody else had. Nobody had advantage in this.
---
Don't remember the names, jjust go talk to Osiris.
---
Same here, but I‚Äôm mainly just speaking for the countless angry people who‚Äôve been here since black armory dropped and still haven‚Äôt gotten a bounty.
---
Yet again, at least they took the RNG out of Toaster and Lemon.
---
Roasted
---
I'll try yoinking, thats a cool trick!
---
How can i download this lmao
---
I doubt many even those at bungie know what the origin of that symbol is. That symbol isn't inherently French anyway as quite a few monarchies in different countries used it.
---
I lfg-d a group for scourge of the past and did my first ever raid. Got anarchy and had a good time, yesterday we did it again and i got anarchy again, they said i had cursed luck (oh also got the curated threat level). I will probably do the raid w them many times and do other raids as well
---
Saves time on majors and ignores shields if they've managed to get them back up. Not sure if the other classes have anything like it but I quite like the Assassin's Cowl exotic which gives you health and invisibility when using a finisher.
---
You hold bord gentle, you don't squeeze it like gun
---
Probably to assert dominance
---
But on the other half I'd open my arms and hug him tightly saying to myself I forgive you.
---
Funny thing about that individual in the middle of the frame: the more I zoom in the less I can tell their age.
---
Is this specimen child, adult? At some perspective I even doubt my initial claim of this being male.
---
Hhmm I see no crayon on them üòÜ (btw titan main, I like red ones as they taste like strawberry)
---
Cryptography can break your heart sometimes.
---
Nice one, I‚Äôm on PC, from UK so usually on in evening, but with it being my Christmas holidays I‚Äôve got time to grind this out ! Happy to help with other quests if I can too ! I managed to get Whisper &amp; Outbreak Perfected this week !!
---
Destiny fanbase: We want stories to connect with each other!
---
Also destiny fanbase: _season of darkness_ ( sorry but season of darkness sounds so bad)
---
While that argument could be made, in the future I suggest using items that a free account doesn't have access to at all. Like the Season Pass exclusive exotic quest weapons, as you still need to play the game to unlock the seasonal mods to use on your terrible stat armor and Symmetry (while fun) can still be gained with some leveling and isn't locked by the pay wall.
---
wow terrible
---
Damn that's a great team. I sherpa a lot so people so I do raids without being treated like a human being
---
Part of the problem is that I‚Äôm still running into blueberries, usually new light, that believe the heroics are rng. Even if you‚Äôre doing the mechanics for it right in front of them. Also there are certain bounties, I think from Benedict/Werner if I remember right, that call for a PE without dying. People would rather just do a normal and get it done.
---
If you like hand cannons forsaken
---
There‚Äôs a lot of forgiveness in this game with its shots. I was in the crucible last night and there was a sniper shot that I barely missed but I died still because of the trail going through the wall...
---
They are not. I have 2x Wings of Sacred Dawn. One has 62 total, is arc element, and has high resilience and strength with low discipline. The other has 60 total, is void, and has high recovery and otherwise balanced spread.
---
And yet the Hunter can‚Äôt heal. Or fly. Two very tactical tools that may ensue many kills.
---
Play Hunter a little, let loose of that wrist of yours (the pun is very easy but not intended, I don‚Äôt know how I could say this without) it‚Äôs very fun! Who knows, it could give you ideas on how to differently Warlockise and Titanify enemies!
---
That‚Äôs what it it to me :)
---
Correct, Flash of Inspiration is creating orbs, Pinch of Light is collecting them.
---
You can buy this season individually
---
The helmet looks like the nita‚Äôs mode (basically the default but with metallics) and the skin is the integra
---
I like how the vex painted him as this massive war god of chaos, then when we meet him he's just a jolly Soviet
---
Buy season of dawn for $10
---
Some consoles just can‚Äôt handle the news
---
That knife had a will on it‚Äôs own to break the Light barrier into this Eliksni‚Äôs cranium.
---
I can agree with the on hit kill aspect in some skill shot weapons but the aim assist is taken to extreme in this game with a lot of weapons and makes a lot of weapons too easy to use. Also adding in extra aim assist with weapons and armor and it makes it where you just aim around someone and it seems too simple. 
---
Back to my question though. What was so great about trials to bring it back?
---
Killing high health enemys so you dont need to waste special/heavy on them. Only noticeably useful in things like 980 NF, sundial and raids tho
---
Do you need me to call an ambulance?

You gotta think, our guardian takes on all sorts of missions on a daily basis, from tactical strikes at the enemy to assisting with Banshee's calibrations. We dive into raids to slay gods and nigh-mythical beings just for fun. We've formed clans, forged alliances and improved relations with various people and factions outside the vanguard. 
---
From his perspective, we have no chill and can't be stopped.
---
Time is only messed up on mercury, i doubt they would bring cayde back (this way at least)

should bind your bunguie account with phone number or somerting like, dota2 did.. to play comp.. or crucble whatever.. So you can start bannignpeople and not accounts..
---
Depends on time and what games I'm playing lol I don't have the time anymore due to college so
---
Oooooh I like this. Not solely based on how you do overall but based on last game, that‚Äôs a great idea!!!
---
Arc titan is useless. Solar top tree is good thanks to hammer strike paired with peregrine greaves, high alpha dmg, weaken effect, low effort. Void top tree is also good for bubble. Magnetic grenades are the best thanks to the aggressive tracking (in combination with armament mods and you have unlimited heavy ammo throughout the strike).
---
Bot that I know of. Maybe they'll add it back in the future

SHIT TEAMMATES ON THE FIELD
---
Username definitely checks out
---
Sometimes you gotta have some fun

*Fuck this shit, I‚Äôm out.*

I dont see how you think they look even kinda alike tbh

That aim is console/controller 
---
If you were on a m&amp;kb that would be much smoother
---
Nice
---
If you remember from the ace of spades quest cayde made a reference about the deep stone crypt, and that he knew something he shouldn't have. He said a secret message in one of the chest recordings and it spelled out "it's on enceleadus", which is a frozen moon of saturn. I could see a season or even expansion all about the exos, cus there is a secret we have yet to learn about them.
---
With this latest update yes, then what did you mean by greater defense? Just the fact that there is invisibility?
---
He also talks about pranking Shaxx. I'm hoping for a Saint-sponsored "Motley Month" April Fool's event.
---
Only 2?
---
Truth has a three round magazine and tracking rockets that proximity detonate.  It's very strong in Gambit against Invaders.  It has value in PVP more than PVE, honestly.
---
Yeah of course there is.. I still don't like account sharing and stuff in a pvp game, but just add a p√•hone number to your bungie account to do comp or hv 2 difgferetn crucible playlists.. if its 1million players, every week, they shouldn't have any problems..
---
I just think it's a big fkn issue tbh.. We had to quit playing because we got cheaters in more or less every second game .. And that shouldnt be a problem in any pvp game imo.
---
I would honestly be fine with all the broken shit and cheese.. If it wasnt for all the aimbot toggles..  and not only teleporters but how many people that just +forward and hit every headshot but can barely walkm around in the game..
---
and then looses 2 rounds and doesnt hit a shot, then all headshot again.
---
It‚Äôs more of the color pallet, the earth tones is what reminds me the most.
---
Yes only two, if you did three your a fucking mad man 2200 fractainal to fully level 1 is hard to come by
---
I think before they add more swords they need to rethink how boss stomps work so they're more viable, or how the ammo economy works for them. Atm they're good for ad clear which isn't what I wanna use my heavy ammo on
---
I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm not sure I understand, do you mean you don‚Äôt even have time to lvl up one char? I understand if so.
---
The explosives help with our "accuracy"
---
I personally think that if they didn‚Äôt add the interesting story bits it would have been worse than Curse of Osiris.
---
Console happened  \**dabs\**
---
That's good shit man
---
Change your year on your console and reload into the EDZ and it should work. Works every time for me. Hope that helps
---
That feel when we don‚Äôt get those 8 strikes..... all SRL really needs is maps to make people happy. Not like they have to design totally new enemy placements and bosses like they do for a strike
---
Alternatively, if you want the meta weapons but don't want to pay/can't afford it... wait until they get added to the f2p package.
---
I can hear the thought of 
---
*lets see what breaks first, My fists, Or your shields*
---
Within this drawing
---
Although a good suggestion, I'll probably leave it for now cheers though
---
They are better at boss DPS than you think. Plus when you get stomped you can just swipe right back to the boss.
---
Hell the shoulder charge/hammer swing/shield bash were nerfed the same time, but they fixed those back. The grenades stayed nerfed, I guess it's just to keep the Titans from having 5-6 OHK abilities when the others only have 2-3.
---
Put mods on for shotgun ammo finding and scavenging and go to town.    It‚Äôs catalyst is pretty nice and easy to fulfill as well.  I find myself constantly using it in PVE.
---
In the background you can see this [thing](https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/p1080x1080/74698398_170329334363679_7938444620383657757_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&amp;_nc_cat=103&amp;_nc_ohc=vmEg1DCx4V8AX_N9nFx&amp;oh=cf02bec79c6aacf489e326367503309e&amp;oe=5EACA0E5)

He's too powerful to be left alive!
---
The amount of passion that went into this.......ur breathtaking
---
What?
---
Oh right
---
Gun Jesus actually did a video on GIGN sniper revolvers, since sometimes you need a very specific weapon that doesn't overpen an aircraft hull or has a short barrel for covert overwatch.   
---
Eriana's a bad gun, however. Unlike the GIGN one.
---
Interesting, but useless in practically all activities.
---
You use hands for melee because you can't charge bayonets with hamon.
---
That's the last dance
---
Or something like, ‚ÄúSaint, I did not expect you to... wait, Guardian?‚Äù
---
Uh, no shit, sherlock. But people can still cross my line of fire, and I think I deserve right of way in most circumstances if I'm using divinity

Make sure you have the Completeing an Impossible Task quest done to have him as a vendor.

If that fails, it is a bug. Sorry.

What exactly is the crossover?
---
The only reason I don‚Äôt think they should bring back bolt caster is because black talon does exactly what bolt caster did but it is better in every way.
---
I would love Dark Drinker because it was the best sword out of them all but they could switch it to solar for D2.
---
It is *possible* that this post was a direct result of the 8 cups of coffee I have already consumed this morning...
---
I thought Izanagi was the Sword-Gun! Darci, your drunk
---
I'll be fighting a whole area myself with nary a teammate in site thinking "where the fuck is my team?"  I can't get the motes because there are to many enemies. Once I finally clear the area and start heading to my motes, three mf jump out from behind rocks and take every last I just made. I fucking hate gambit.

Noice

I think the words yeeted and ganked were the funniest words I‚Äôve read this week
---
Little light is my favorite phone app
---
&gt;Did it have something that really set apart from the current aspect of pvp? 
---
Yes. It was the first 3v3 game mode in Destiny. It had exclusive weapons and armor. It had a unique system(card, boons, etc.). It was only on the weekends. No matchmaking. It's what Survival stems from. It's where Elimination came from. It's, arguably, the only real competitive game mode.
---
It's also on a list of things that I think never should have been removed like SRL, factions(D1 style), Queen's Wrath(remember that 1 month in D1? Pepperidge Farms remembers), etc.
---
What about saint with paint
---
Ikora in Bora Bora?
---
Edge transits, anyone?
---
Sorry, I haven't played GW2 much since stuff was added above legendary.
---
it‚Äôs in the seasonal page with the other season of dawn stuff, supposed to be sold for bright dust at some point
---
Honestly. Most of the kills I get is purely luck. Cause even then I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúOh shit I got him? I GOT HIM!!‚Äù
---
Ikora rey in a bay but thats a good one too
---
Niiiice

&gt;‚ÄùWhy don‚Äôt you just call me Dell, ma‚Äôam. Conagher was my [father‚Äôs ](https://www.reddit.com/user/Destiny_Flavor_Text)name.‚Äù

Traveler bless randoms with PvP skill. I try my damndest not to die or to hunt them depending on my mote count, but I‚Äôm no Sentry or Invader.
---
I go to the edz by winding cove. One spawns below the spot xur stands. Kill everything up top and when you jump back down another captain is spawning
---
That Shaxx greenscreen is a blessing
---
Imagine getting upset at a picture. 
---
Nah op this is great. Dont listen to the 12 year olds chatter.
---
Full Metal Jacket
---
Right because guardians really needed someone to tell them to shoot the aliens. The fact that we were able to kill the barons and uldren by ourselves shows that his coordination is optional.
---
Why is every buddy so god a riming
---
Imagine if you held down the super button it would hold the Bubble as long as you held those buttons down. But the problem is you don‚Äôt get to attack back. So once you pop the supper it‚Äôs over.
---
Amen i have a Zavala one too
---
I like to hunt... as a hunter. So running around in the open isnt my style.
---
Drifter on a sifter
---
I get that. But running into the open to pop then book it outta there.. idk. I have a titan brain
---
do you still get lord of the wolves from spider bounties or is it xur and random drop only?
---
WHERE ARE THE CRAYONS!
---
FotL masks have 0 power so it lowers their average. there‚Äôs only a few items that have 0 power
---
Well, the ghost can revive our guardian, I thin they should be able to handle minor concussions :P
---
when's minotaur on a scimitar?
---
Instead of ‚Äúhare's breath‚Äù (which would mean the exhalations of a rabbit), we found ‚Äúhair's breath.‚Äù Closer, but still no cigar. ... The common expression ‚Äúhair's breadth‚Äù means the width of a hair, and it's used figuratively to indicate a narrow or close margin.
---
*HEAVY METAL INTENSIFIES*
---
All stories have an end. Saint fourteen has only begun his final destination.
---
I am now, went from 42% to 85%! :D
---
You do need someone to shoot aliens. You think you coordinated the assassinations of the barons yourself? Why do you think Petra sought out spider for help? What would you do without him? Wander around until you found them? Of you hadn't had spider, uldren would have released Riven and wrought havoc among us
---
With a side of sadness
---
I‚Äôd also like to know what dis means
---
Don't know why but I read Buck's part with Saint 14's voice
---
Yeah it‚Äôs seems like every time I look at my k/d emblem it goes down by 0.01
---
"Getting an exotic you want"
---
You think if I give Riven cookies she'll give me 1k?
---
(Also could use and arbalest too)
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs gonna be the same way with forsaken. Every guardian hunts the Vex down that murdered him. Kill that Vex,tea bag him,than have a server wide memorial.
---
Xur is currently selling Contraverse Hold. Go have fun with that.
---
30 min
---
"Rate my setup, Guardian"
---
My favorite was when the "Silver for a level of Season" got out in Undying and some one in DTG claimed that the exotics that came with it were an unfair advantage and creating pay to win systems of buying gear.
---
then get a pc and change the in-game language
---
Because people like to downvote mistakes... It's stupid
---
The I guess you may need the season pass
---
Too true
---
You can also get it from Xur.
---
They're implementing systems that allow f2p players to get seasonal exotics...
---
Plus they're both average at best.
---
Good to know
---
Im playng warlock since d1 and all dlc's if i get just a 10 minutes in i can get u to lvl 30 at least
---
Do you still have any introductory quests left? Or anything with the Destiny logo in general? What about in the tower or somewhere else?
---
It should be on the bungie site as a banner on the top of the page
---
Yeah I have all of them, though I deleted them. Any way to get them back? Hopefully I didn't dig myself into an even deeper hole in a failed attempt to fix the issue.
---
Go talk to people and hope for the best, I guess?
---
yes bc im spending a nice chunk of money out of the bat. im getting one for my graduation which is in may, currently im not able to spend $700+.
---
(Continued) engrams after they drop in the world. Your goal would be to run after it, get your loot back and then fend off the goblin once it throws a fit. The goblin could be an actual goblin from European folklore or a runt of a dreg that scavenges guardians loot.

Every time I use the rock out emote and people do something in response I feel better about myself and forget everything that frustrated me that day because for one moment strangers did something silly together.
---
Hmm, if I meaninglessly paragraph it out does it make it better? It's a legitimate gripe I have but everyone seems to think in just "flexin'" or whatever. Truth is if you spend any time using it you basically have a game cheese.
---
lord of wolves and its catalyst dropped for me in the same day lol
---
Man this is so true.
---

So lucky
---
Hmm, that's odd. You went to https://www.bungie.net/pcmove and followed the steps there? What does it say under transfer details?
---
Christmas and myself just came early
---
The watermark is the ridiculous part.
---
Random or Xur. But please do not use it. It‚Äôs super toxic and people will hate you for using it.
---
Admit it you were singing the bayblade theme song, don't lie!
---
Remember, every time you headbutt someone a Saint-14 gets its wings.
---
Nah I‚Äôm trying to get all exotics I just need this queenbreaker and borealis
---
Damn! My favourite warframe ever. I remember when she used to spore all the enemies in the fucking level from room to room lol
---
I just get a "Transfer Error" and if I click retry it says "DestinyAccountNotFound"
---
It could be a intentional thing since it is a ranged melee
---
What did i win?
---
So lame
---
Just trying to land a joke that doesn't seem to be funny. Your title made it seem to me that you were dissatisfied with the "nerf bow" and that you would have preferred something more menacing. I was trying the leverage that of course you got that for Christmas, santa only gives out toys. I'm not trying to be a d either, I'm sorry if I came across that way
---
Which character's tiddies are best?
---
Celestial Fire is bugged so Impact Induction doesn't work with it. At least *some* perks do work with it...
---
I hate that exotic
---
I have this exact copy and honestly, it is clean. So beautifully clean. Get kill clip and then wipe the floor with enemies in pvp
---
A Scientific Fax.
---
There is no objective "best." There are a large number of good hand cannons. 
---
Personally, I use mainly 110 RPM hand cannons in pve because I prefer hand cannons that take less shots to kill red health bar enemies, but everyone else calls them garbage so you should probably not use these unless you, too specifically like the way they "feel."
---
okay, unfortunately this is somewhat different than what happened to me, so I'm unable to help you, however I referred you to a mentor of the bungie forums who was able to help me. He's just a volunteer, and may be busy over the holidays, but if he's available, he'll send you a PM. Hopefully you guys will be able to get it fixed!
---
It's still a good weapon when it works as intended, and you need it to blow up the crystal thingies in Dreaming City.
---
Could be actually a variant of the fallen, since the fallen are known to be extreme scavengers.
---
Well the bug on wishender is already confirmed that they are going to fix it so that's one. Though they are also discussing buffing it after its fixed so maybe it'll remain nesr where it is now. I hope so. Using izinagis on every thing is boring. 
---
Arbalest is somewhat addressed but without enhanced unflinching mod I'm sure It'll fall back into obscurity
---
I remember playing d1 when it first came out and I got so scared of those hive majors lol
---
Well my aim is bout as bad as yours hun üòÇ
---
When you really want to buy a looping emote but there's only 4 slots and you already paid for 2 others :'(
---
Honestly I use ratking without the catalyst and it's not bad in Crucible , I did it on my Titan and just like.. invisible shoulder charge ...they never see it coming lolüòÇ
---
Oh well, thanks alot for trying to help me!:) And ofc referring this problem to Bungie mentor... hopefully he'll be able to help...
---
Ur stats suck ngl

Go claim quests from Eva, no level requirements. Make sure to grab the sparrow quests. To get the material to bake candy, kill a load of enemies with different weapons and abilities. Essence comes from strikes or public events, stuff like that. Once you get all that, in your quests tab will be the oven, where you slot in the materials and make something
---
Listen up good people of the city!

Lmao you're such a fucking crybaby I'm not back tracking shit we used it and it was a fucking blast, downvotes don't mean shit to me my ego isn't as sensitive as yours and you made it personal saying we are cancerous lol suck a dick a move on

Xur sells 5 exotics each week (1 weapon, 1 armor for each class with low stat rolls, and 1 exotic engram. The weapon and armors are the exact same for everyone, the engram's contents are random). He is only available from Friday to Tuesday though, and changes places weekly. Use whereisxur.com to find him. You need about 170 legendary shards to buy everything he has to offer.
---
High level Nightfall the Ordeals have heightened chances of dropping exotics, and doing 950/980 ordeals is the most efficient method of getting random exotics (with good rolls on the armor to boot)

90% of the community are trash with snipers. Even moreso with linears. Arbalest is harder to use than a sniper my guy.

Yeah it's a bug, I'm getting the same problem
---
Omg this guys amazing!
---
Complaining about a weapon that takes actual skill and trigger discipline?...really dude?
---
How about we talk about all the shotgun using one hit KO melee titans running around? That is the kind of pvp build that takes the least amount of skill to use.
---
Even worse if your doing the Darkness in the Light quest. I was banking on 5 every time because I didnt want to lose 30 motes of progress
---
Knight on a Jedi Knight. I see now.
---
Yea, reunite in the forge LOL
---
Well, yes, but considering we're talking about Uldren himself and not just some random Earthborn, it's kind of a big deal and requires some level of diplomacy. I understand everyone wanting revenge, but I also understand the fact that the City can't afford potentially alienating allies or drawing yet another enemy to their walls.

Thanks, I completely forgot about him from the first game!
---
I have been told that about 6 times now. It's good you heard. I haven't heard from anywhere so I just learned something. Everyone who is rudely telling me this (not you) doesn't appreciate the fact I didn't know this and that I just found out, and they don't understand I never seen any post about it.
---
The real pain is bothering to play normal gambit in the first place.
---
Less sweaty, loot is better.
---
be even better if you used the baking cookies emote.
---
the last time I played regular gambit the opposite happened, got 30 kills with thunderlord, never does to the enemy team
---
Im not claiming i know everything about forges man, im just asking why would i get queued up with people at like 400 power level and shit and theyre afk. Alot of times i would just back out before the forge really started up but still doesnt make sense why i sometimes get queued up with them.
---
Dont worry man your good. It happens. No reason for people to be giving you hate for it.
---
if you don't have the upgrade modules, you can use the collections tab on the character screen to reacquire any weapon that isn't randomly rolled (exotics, y1 weapons, curated rolls).
---
Fairly common since the matchmaker is quite bad at creating balanced teams.
---
Kindled orchid with drop mag, kill clip, rampage, and rampage spec
---
Nope, bringing back Saint was only possible because time shattered on Mercury (and by extension, the Infinite Forest).
---
From a storytelling standpoint, it doesn't even make sense to bring back Cayde. He started off alive and well, and a huge deal was made out of his death. In Saint's case, we kicked off the game with him already being a long-dead legend, so we brought him back as a way of formally introducing his character.
---
And he's got lovely hands!
---
Most ironic one I've seen was "TrumpNeverLoses" in PvP and he ended up with a .5 kd ratio on the losing team. That one right there gave me a chuckle.
---
either look up if some one posted a video on youtube about the best pistols in Destiny or try to optain as many as possible and try them out at the same place on the same enemys to see the diffrents each pistol has.
