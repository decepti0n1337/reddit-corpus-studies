I just answer your question

F for Cayde... may his life be gambling in heaven
---
i believe it‚Äôs ‚ÄúClouds at Sea‚Äù, looks damn good.
---
Sure! It's Gravendoom#1914
---
Yeah ik. Thanks for the feedback!

Vex with hydras are THE WORST. destroys a game every time.

Welcome To Destiny 2, the game where the rabbits shoot you.
---
I can‚Äôt even grind it baked af, I‚Äôm gonna settle for my 7/10 roll
---
Where are you located? It's fairly common for me on the West Coast.
---
Are you running low?  I wanna say no
---
Yes I don‚Äôt have any tubes
---
Head butt finisher...eververse for 1000 silver in bound.
---
maybe next weeks twab will have something to say about supers (looking at you also bottom tree dawnblade)
---
Is that the infamous Ace of Jokes?
---
Get you a blast furnace with fedding frenzy and kill klip or rampage.  Get it from forge pulse rifle bountie can farm it over and over tell you get a good roll. 
---
Run menagerie there are lot of good weapons you can get from there here a rune guid
---
https://menagerie-calculator.now.sh/
---
Also play strikes and turn in vangard tokens for outrageous Fortune with hard launch and spike grenades
---
Blast furnace, Ikelos shotgun, and outrageous Fortune is not a bad load out to have as you try to get better. All pretty eazy to get.
---
*Gets blasted by Giant Beam of Death instead*
---
Oh that load out was godly. I can still use it. Get a hit with Le monarch and clean up with antiope. The antiope has kill clip.
---
Ope gave him the ol spinny spin he def quit the game lmao

[This is a very commonly asked question](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/search?q=buy+PC&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=month). The short answer: wait until October 1, when the game moves to steam, and Forsaken will be on the steam store. This has nothing to do with cross save, it is because Destiny 2 has to move from  battle net to steam.

No, how it works is the runes you put into your chalice determine the items you get from the chest at the end. There are a variety of charts and websites showing the recipes.
---
remember the days of sunbracers ... XUR REMEMBERS
---
Jesus it's bad enough you have no life beyond the game why demand others forfeit theirs? It's a simple question with a simple answer but you're acting like he spit on your religious idol.

The break will be short lived as they're turned into cheese from Whisper and Izanagi rounds.
---
rune finders strikes or crucible
---
I‚Äôm still waiting for my Doomsday :(
---
Get power and efficiency 2, then use rune finders and wealth of the emperor consumables from Werner and grind strikes/crucible.
---
Can‚Äôt you do it with the dawn blade for warlocks?
---
I run high comp solo, hardly ever run into full teams.
---
As someone who recently just picked up D2 again, wtf mission/place is this dude at??!
---
Warlocks got no ass. Male or female
---
I imagined that gut from inFamous but part-robot
---
Looks like a standard judo move to redirect your force and throw you at the wall. seems fine.

The Bitch Who Lived
---
Happy birthday!
---
I feel like i completed it  (on accident )to but the story feels completely disconnected then.  Half the stuff i see people talk about in regards to CoO makes me feel like i missed a mission or something.
---
There is a story mission for one of the lost prophecies. If you haven't yet gotten the Perfect Paradox shotgun, then this could be it.
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
This doesn't make sense, I had better chance of spare rations before this "increase".
---
I completely forgot about that. Might have to before Shadowkeep
---
Ironic considering all the apes I see now just use backup plan erentil
---
What does Minecraft have to do with those games
---
Thanks dude!
---
Finally got Jotunn!
---
It is really good in both PvP and pve
---
The resurgence of the people playing it
---
Mine has range masterwork, liquid coils, under pressure, and high impact reserves.
---
These are good perks if you plan to use the fun actively, ie having it out all the time and trying to get kills with it. 
---
I believe a more reactionary roll has back up plans on it, which is a great perk if you plan to have a different weapon out most of the time but want to switch to your fusion quickly to take someone down
---
Okay ty
---
Will do

I‚Äôve  watched guides just haven‚Äôt figured out to start it thanks

You know what guardian, straight up that's rad. I'm glad you're enjoying the game.
---
Breech Loading GLs are one of the few weapons to have a reload cap which they hit with Enh. GL Loader. the only way to go past that is with forced reloads. also, Autoloading holster is useful in that it gives the weapon a fire and stow. letting you fire a quick shot, switch to another weapon and deal damage until it reloads, giving it a cycle. Grave Robber is *especially* useful on hunters with long range melees.
---
Even though most of the time it‚Äôs bad lfg‚Äôs. Stacks really don‚Äôt matter until you get to fabled 3/mythic, at which point you probably want a team anyway

Stunlock bosses.

Why are you being down voted? Hello reskinned raid gear lol

Complaining about radar lmao that's it I've seen everything
---
Not at all! I think I started 2 about 2 weeks ago and I‚Äôve completed the campaign. There‚Äôs loads of people that will of only just recently got it...it‚Äôs not really a game that gets ‚Äúold‚Äù as such
---
‚ÄúOh nice one, that was real smooth. Good job buddy you‚Äôre a credit to your family‚Äù
---
Maybe it‚Äôll get better when they remove negative modifiers tomorrow ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Try Two-Tail Fox. It‚Äôll destroy supers.
---
Same for Tractor Cannon and Sleeper. 
---
You can also Izanagi‚Äôs bodyshot a goldie if you‚Äôre quick.
---
bl3 came out already...
---
‚ÄúIf my answers frighten you, you should cease asking scary questions‚Äù - Jules from Pulp Fiction. Also, me anytime I draw blank stares from people when I launch into exactly why a weapon in a video game they have no interest in was nerfed and why that‚Äôs a good thing.
---
It‚Äôs not it‚Äôs own emblem, you equip it through the regular gambit emblem ( can‚Äôt remember what it‚Äôs called) like you would for something like the nightfall emblems.
---
LOL, what a useless super.
---
Pinnacle weapons? Idk how I'm going to remember all this stuff. I hadn't played since the beginning of 2018. I'm so far out of the meta and I don't know what weapons exist now. Is there a guide you could recommend?
---
There is no cap this time (but some stated it ends at 960) but it resets at the end of each season (you get higher light from artifact and upgrading it. Noone knows how big that bost will be, they may change game so it ni longer will be the light that decides about dmg output.
---
Wait, is Tess selling an all black shader? The second I get home from school I‚Äôm buying it.
---
Me too mate.
---
At the beginning of D1 there was defense stat and light was just like lvl is now
---
*shuffles a bit in my seat and looks at all my enhancement cores*
---
I'll definitely complete the story then.
---
talking about whisper of the worm mission , lol
---
Finally no gold trim or red carbon fiber!
---
Just watch some YouTubers explain weapons and reviews for good weapons and if you don‚Äôt know how the systems work. Don‚Äôt worry you‚Äôll understand eventually I started end of 2018 and took a break for a while got back into it you‚Äôll understand.

---
The easiest exotics can be gotten from Xur, Friday through Monday.  Recluse &amp; Mountaint Top are not exotics.  They are pinnacle weapons that came from quest.
---
Thorn, Lumina, Wish-ender Bow, and Truth are all relatively easy quests.
---
Wendigo is a legendary grenade launcher from a Zavala Pinnacle quest that is relatively easy also.
---
As to the invader part of the Lumina quest.  Use your Truth, watch the other team's motes bar.  The white section of the bar is the motes collected, yellow is motes deposited. There are tick marks that separate sections of this bar.  Each tick mark is where the invasion portal will open for that team.  When you see they have enough motes to invade, find a high spot that you can see most of the map from.  The invader usually spawns at an area other than where the current enemy spawn is.  As soon as you hear "invader is here"  start looking and shoot him as soon as he spawns.  I am an average player but have more than 50 of the Not on My Watch medals.  The more you practice at it the better you will get.  You may also want to run with a team that knows what you are doing and will help you out.  I run with 1 or 2 others usually and we call out where the invader is to each other.
---
On pc use hand cannons that‚Äôs basically the meta

Something something darkside...

I thought I had had a stroke.

Honestly Amethyst Veil is the closest you can get to an all black ahader

I'm on Xbox. I just know I only see hunters and Titans and there's a pulse and auto rifle I see a lot. (I can't remember the names lol)

Hero‚Äôs burden is slept on. I used it with malfeasance for void kills for the thorn quest and had it done in no time.

make sure when you play with him to call him Sgt Lipton
---
Good work op. I like them :)
---
I‚Äôve talked to a few people and they speculate cause pewdiepie is back to playing it pretty heavily.
---
but if you kill them all then drifter pulls you back
---
Man i wish i had played D1, because D2 is just an amazing game and everyone says D1 is BETTER.
---
This literally happened to me yesterday, I didnt even know the knives could blow through a bubble like that lol I wonder if one of those people was me lol ( I cant read the names )
---
That ghost about to make that mother the mother of a guardian
---
Is this back when spectral was busted?
---
How often can you open those up
---
i'm not a long time Destiny player so i cannot for the life of me make sense of how it works
---
What‚Äôs great is my gamer tag is stormsurge
---
No this was about a week ago
---
You're right. It IS the most beautiful thing in the world.
---
Since no one plays Anthem we should take their customization. Different material/ decal and a color wheel is all we need.
---
*And* that doesn‚Äôt have any wear like the DO ones
---
Or it has a grid pattern everywhere
---
If you have the Xbox app on your phone, you can access your screenshots and such from anywhere. There's also a ton of other handy features that I think make it worth having.

Almost every iron banner shader would work. Also precursor vex chrome works

Wait, someone joined you mid-comp match? I thought backfilling was impossible in comp?
---
nice
---
Well I didn't do IB (because I hate PVP) so I'm boned then
---
October.
---
Aka, the most basic bitch shaders of the whole game. There were great shaders that were ignored because of those two.
---
lucky everyone says its what inside that matters! :D
---
This made me laugh. Well done.
---
Redrix is a fantastic pve weapon. Until the changes next season it is situational at best in PvP
---
Im a titan main and that was straight up sexy

Also whats that shader on the revolver, looks neat

I got this helm finally... wanted to try out that big bad bubble... immediate regret.

Not maybe, already tried it on my notebook

Auto-loading holster. Fire off the mag, switch to something like Loaded Question (which also has ALH), switch back and keep cycling.
---
Put on Strafe Glide. It is much, much easier to manage than Burst Glide.
---
Basically though, imagine that your second jump makes gravity much weaker. If you are still ascending when you hit it (so like if you rapidly hit jump twice), you'll continue to drift upward for a bit. That's how you gain height as a Warlock. Same way with lateral momentum. 
---
Note also that after free-falling a certain distance, activating your glide will entirely negate downward momentum, allowing you to level off in steep drops. 
---
You have two things limiting your glide: Number of activations and time spent gliding. You can deactivate your glide at any time by pressing jump again. You can activate your glide three times before you have to land again. There is also a certain amount of time you can stay in the air before your glide will turn off. Whichever one of those you hit first, then your glide will no longer function (you won't be able to turn it back on, and if it is on it will deactivate).
---
When making long jumps to lower platforms, I recommend deactivating and reactivating your glide as needed. The initial momentum kill lasts for a few seconds, so you hit it, glide until you start to go down more than you're going forward, then turn it off, fall a couple meters, then turn it on again; you'll even out and be able to go further than if you'd just left the glide on.
---
Wherever possible, remember to save your third glide activation for right before you hit the ground.
---
If your armor has a lot of metal accents they will get the chrome, soft parts such as leather get a fabric design, and armor plating gets black/dark purple camo.
---
It you're not using strafe glide, ur using warlock wrong

Yea I meant is that the one you meant, dunno if there's one for the chest

I want my jade rabbit to three tap in crucible again

Sorry, I‚Äôm still trying to figure out how to screencap on xbox and I panicked
---
Lol, its comp. Dick move in quick play, but if you bring that bubble into comp, I'm shitting on you. No way around it
---
Hmm maybe I borked it somehow Then. Or they had Helm of Saint 14? I‚Äôll have to look into it in that case
---
Nice
---
Perfect opportunity to troll with the skyrim intro
---
Gotcha. I'm not very good (I don't feel like I'll ever be able to hit 5500), but I was surprised at how easy it was to hit 2100 considering the way people talk about it.
---
Wait till Shadowkeep comes out
---
That's alright man you're not in any trouble
---
What the hell is that donut flying about?
---
If you are on console the problem is much less prevalent.
---
What I love about playing bubble in D1 was that half the people that had supers that could easily deal with a bubble didn‚Äôt know how to. Half the time golden gunners would ether stand outside or walk straight in and nova bombs would be an instant ko 90% of the time (you would have to leave the bubble at the right time to survive it) but warlocks still tried to pop one in the bubble which almost always got them killed
---
As someone who likes using erentil I completely agree with you.
---
Yeeaah I am trying to get an armor set from there and this is exactly how it feels
---
You are wrong, WeaponRex. What everyone is saying about not being able to damage the enemies is correct. It's possible a cutie with 300 something light joined a forge in hopes of being carried and finishing but 1)that's stupid 2)I've never seen it 3)I don't think you can unlock forges and be that low.  We farmers lower our gear to hit those depths. Only movement I've seen from others when forge farming is someone run off in one direction and I can tell they rubber-banded their controller despite not needing to do so.
---
Forge farming is a victim-less crime. Like punching someone in the dark.

WHAT PART OF "AT THAT LEVEL YOU CANNOT EVEN DAMAGE ENEMIES" DON'T YOU GET? IF THERE IS ANY LOW LEVEL TRYING TO DO A FORGE, THEY WON'T EVEN BE ABLE TO DO IT! DAMN IT! AND THERE ARE NO PLAYERS TRYING TO DO THAT!
---
And no. If you join a forge with low level and then switch back to your gear, people in matchmaking automatically joins you. I've tried that with my clanmates back then on BA season.
---
Why do you need that tho?
---
You have to kill the boss.
---
K
---
If you want help to get it and are on PC I'd be happy to help you get it.
---
So this is incorrect. The precision damage that rank and file enemies so minors, Is getting changed to be the standard precision multiplier that majors and bosses had most of the time if you look at red bar enemies you overkill them anyway this is specifically why they stated that some buffs or greater when it comes to precision damage on minor targets versus the buff overall
---
You trying to yell at me thru the internet? Lol funny.

I swear this has been posted about 10 times today

That‚Äôs actually amazing

I think I got some decent year one weaponry, it‚Äôs that armor stats that will be pretty bad

WTC Supreme robes

Nah man bottom striker is worse

I don‚Äôt get it, so we allowed to drive cars in the crucible now.?

I recently had a match where a blueberry kept taking the invasions and dying instantly.  I had my Notorous invader set ready to go.  I asked why he wouldn't let me invade and he said "no you're trash"  then later made fun of me not getting any invader kills even though i didn't invade.  I'm fine with letting allies invade, but please don't pull this crap.

Good
---
you can DDOS the main server ... Destiny2 doesnt use a straight P2P, its like hybrid version (which makes it worse I think, thats why you can ddos one person.. if its was pure p2p, iots like chain connected so u dsiconenct halft of the players if u ddos one.. or some shit.. But Bungie should fucking talk to steam, they have servers for DOTA and CS.. You can ofc DDOS the mainhost, but I dont understand how they can forcebrute the encryption ?.. 
---
since WOW is alot of different servers on a server, you can DDOS the one thats the player you playing connected to .. and stuff.
---
Either Geo mags or Heart of Inmost light pls.
---
AND PLS NOT ANOTHER OEM WITH ENHANCED HAND CANON TARGETTING
---
I had one recently where a blueberry would take the invasions and die instantly claiming I was "trash"  Didn't even invade once.  I'm all for letting allies invade, but don't pull that sort of crap
---
Can you provide video?
---
Yup! I drunkenly Jack Sparrow‚Äôd my name to recluse.
---
As a titan main I support this idea. Even Zavala prefers to punch stuff.
---
Wow. You don't even know how the power level system works in this game.
---
Lol
---
Seriously man.  Stop pushing that button.
---
You are strong and wise and I am very proud of you
---
Hahah lol
---
For what purpose?  In 2 weeks with Shadowkeep's launch lvl is going away, so why grind it out?
---
If you want to do something productive, collect materials while completing the campaigns.  Once your Dreaming City is open, open all three forges and upgrade the chalice for menagerie.  
---
Having the forges and menagerie open on all three characters gives you **15 power drops per week** that you get to choose.  If you have ever curse Rahool for that 25th edge transit when all you really needed, or wanted, were a pair of boots, you know how important that can be.
---
[deleted]
---
 A whole new type of weapon?
---
I think give hunters a special ammo bowstaff, kinda like a sword/arcstrider but green ammo
---
Warlocks could get a spell book that allows them to like shoot fireballs and shit, could probably be special or primary
---
Titans... idk just take their gun away and let them punch shit

---
Fellow Titans of class I see! 
---
I‚Äôve done bubble without a Well. Found the best trick is to back up against the middle pedestal of the capture zones that way you can‚Äôt be stomped backwards and off the bridge. 
---
I‚Äôd really love if they minimized the stomp effect in Reckoning. Maybe it should be so that it sends you out of the capture zone but not off *__THE FREAKIN BRIDGE!!__* lol. 
---
Or maybe make the walls on the bridge just a little bit higher so the stomp can‚Äôt send you off. 
---
Either way that stomp is the worst and I hates it.
---
Might be decent if it let friendlies shoot out of it from the inside
---
yes go to battle net and download it
---
Very similar. I don‚Äôt even feel I‚Äôve been working hard and I look down and think wtf - what have you been doing all this time?
---
Okay ima just delete this... I‚Äôm so dumb I‚Äôm sorry üòÖ
---
I‚Äôm sorry, what the fuck? I understand what‚Äôs going on here, but isn‚Äôt that...... overkill?
---
Separate purchase.
---
Where would I download it, in the games section destiny 2 isn‚Äôt listed, would I just go to account &gt; games &amp; subscriptions and get it from there?
---
Bought and sold separately I'm afraid.
---
wait so have you never downloaded it before?
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs ridiculous. I was expecting to get booted after a few hours, and net like a thousand or so. But it just kept running...
---
‚ÄúDamn titans, yeeting themselves wherever they please! We hunter mains need equality!‚Äù
---
- my only friend that I (sort of) care about
---
This may be the case, but I‚Äôm searching for the download link on my iPad since currently I don‚Äôt have my PC but to answer your question, yes, I have downloaded it. Would the download be available on my PC whenever I get home?
---
I keep seeing this, whats up with worldline zero and warlocks?
---
yeah it‚Äôll be on the launcher
---
Alright cool well thanks for the help! Greatly appreciated!

One or two tethers really is more than enough for the reckoning, as long as someone kill the snipers on the sides of the map

Isn't afk forges faster? 4 planet materials every ~1min 30 sec

Dodging the shots m8. You can't button mash through a hallway that long and come out unscathed.

sorry, i hit post and it was saying "error could not post"  didn't mean to spam it.
---
sorry I hit post and it kept giving me an error.  i really didn't mean to spam it so much
---
Warlocks are literally space wizards? I‚Äôm not talking about a list of combos you have to memorize, I‚Äôm talking about a book you equip in your weapon slot and you would hold it while throwing fireballs and shit like that with your other. Also I literally came up with the idea I‚Äôm like 4 seconds
---
no, this is why titans have a bad rep.
---
Very sorry for accidentally spamming that post.  won't happen again
---
Yay
---
erentil is just a bodyshot chaperone change my mind
---
what was he trying to say
---
Repost reeee
---
Rude
---
I thought they said they were buffing machine gun damage?
---
I'm pretty sure an Arc Staff heavy can one shot you from inside the bubble.
---
Nerfing range on specific Heavy Machine Guns if I remember correctly
---
The Ol' Bong and Clang
---
Pretty sure they are only removing negative modifiers like blackout or attrition.
---
ball and chain?
---
huh. never heard that one before
---
Bottom tree striker, disrespecting even teammates.
---
Seems accurate.
---
Me too
---
I haven't had a bygones drop since season 6
---
Well yeah. Shadow keep got delayed.
---
Then theres the people who will pay over $500 dollars for luna or notforgotten. Its sad.
---
Multikill clip and Rapid hit, its a midnight coup on steroids
---
What about rapid hit and rampage or rapid hit and kill clip ?
---
And reasons like that is why I left that sub!
---
Circle-face!
---
Yep, sums up my experiences with hunters + the times when all they do is jump in the air with shotguns.
---
I personally hate tracking weapons. It's a "no skill, free kill" thing that is really annoying to fight against. Right now the Jotunn is the worst one for me. The tracking is aggressive and with it being a one shot kill is even worse.
---
Shits so boring I fall asleep at my desk
---
I hate hunturds
---
Jotuhn feels kinda cheesy sometimes, but I'm able to dodge it most if the times. There are a lot of kinda broken things rn. Just find what suits you best and go with it.
---
Me gusta.
---
***Why is Cayde the Jack of Spades and not the Ace***
---
the fuckin chicken from Moana
---
Cayde cool but what did hawthorn ever do
---
The infamous latency pills. Good shit.
---
It‚Äôs funnier because most of the time that lone guardian gets killed by someone else before the barrage even hits them so it‚Äôs extra pointless.
---
I believe it's 960, with a seasonal artifact that has no cap.
