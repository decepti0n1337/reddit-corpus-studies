Yeah I know, sucks tying down the exotic for that though. I mean my loadout can get the job done just would be nice to get one heavy GL with spikes, ever.
---
---
---
Sadly no because you get overwhelmed by their numbers.
---
The time limit is the same though.
---
I still can't belive it was my First exotic by choice
---
In IB a bunch of randos and I were crushing a 5 stack, it must have upset them because they all equipped Wolves and came back to win by like 5 points or something.
---
It's a weeb joke ignore it
---
Ever time you summon your ghost with this shell it should make Minecraft ambient sounds
---
I am just confused on how it survived the first set of reworks for exotics way back. Is there something I’m missing or is it basically not useful at all?
---
oh sorry my bad deleting now
---
On your heavy? That's why you use militias birthright or orewings maul for it. At the very least, use Fighting Lion.
---
Player level cap is 50, but light/power level is 750.
---
We will watch your career with great interest
---
Shoot at the feet/ground.
---
That gritty, realistic look. Fuck Yea
---
Um, get the app?
---
Tap the trigger, firmly planted, particle repeater, long scope, stability mw
---
Yeah it's fine on console.
---
I’m not thinking so guy. iOS?
---
Well done, fellow Gunslinger
---
go go power rangers
---
Proxy nades were nerfed and make it so you can't one shot anymore
---
Slightly unrelated: whenever I'm running through the Infinite Forest, and I have to open the door between each section, I hear Mara/Riven saying "OPEN THE DOOR".
---
So what about other who wants to get rid of stress? This makes it ok?? Choice?? What about my choice not to be teabagged. There should be a middle ground. I chose to play the game be harassed this way. Wtf .
---
Where are the memorials I’ve never seen them?
---
I love how the hive glyphs light up when you get kills with it
---
Maturity shows you should ignore it? Thats just hoping it will go away.
---
If Shaxx and Mara ever had a baby, it wouldn't be half as beautiful as this painting. Wauw.
---
It's ingrained in my mind
---
Oh well nvm
---
Ok this is a trivial matter to you then. Ok
---
Then I guess learn to accept it or change hobbies because it’s basically part of gaming and I don’t think the opinion that someone playing the game how they want should be bannable is going to effect any game devs anytime soon. If you don’t accept it, then that’s a nice opinion but life is all about differences in what we call opinions
---
Yes. It was given to everyone who currently owns the base game.
---
Bad childhood gang
---
Rip celestial granting keyhole
---
Yes, I know nothing about you but what you've presented here: you take bagging in a PvP video game as a serious affront. Vis a vis, you try to compare it to car crashes and someone insulting you in person. Concordantly my opinion is that you lack perspective.
---

---
Here's a solution for you: a teabag isn't disrespect; it's them kindly thanking you for being an easy kill and bumping their k/d.
---
Thats sad but were on pc. Thanks for the invite though!
---
That’s up to you and which ever platform you enjoy being on more. Focus on that one and play it until Shadowkeep then make it override your other platform. If you feel like the grind isn’t worth it then just focus on the one with the most progress.
---
He got shit on by a blue boi
---
*Activation*
---
Failsafe&gt;Asher
---
How do you see how many kills you have?
---
Your choice not to be bagged is called either getting over it or not playing. The middle ground is getting better at the game so as to not get bagged. There’s your choices.
---
There’s one that’s right in front of Zavala, it’s a little Ace of Spades on the ground. Amanda Holliday also has Cayde’s cape on the wall next to her, and the ramen shop has Cayde’s picture on the wall.
---
One in front of zavala and another in the ramen shop
---
Well, it would REALLY be 100% the speed of Light.
---
You can call it what ever you want.
---
The modifier changes every day and I can recall it only being on last Tuesday and sometime during the weekend but definitely not the majority of the days.
---
Honestly that's what I was thinking. I have literally no exotics on xbox and I'm not grinding a titan and warlock through everything again haha so its pretty much a no brainer I'm just hard headed af.
---
Have you seen the yellow sign?
---
Maturity shows that it’s not important enough to be worth noticing or getting mad at. There’s a difference between ignoring something and realizing it doesn’t matter that much.
---
Yea that hunter is going to have a hard time...
---
Dude. Do you have this in a desktop resolution?
---
OK this is cool how do you get these
---
There is this thing called a middle ground. People should not be subjected to this. Yeah because people makes this an ok behavior.
---
I honestly see a quick teabag as just a hand wave or nod to the individual and not an assertion of dominance or whatever. Maybe because I run with a few def/no mic users and that’s their typical “hi” or “look at me” move. So in return I do a quick crouch-crouch and carry on as a sort of “gg” to someone I won a gun off with.
---
So your saying I’m bad at the game. Thats an automatic response and you know it. Seriously.
---
Cave Sound Eleven
---
Damn! Pretty impressive.
---
You know, I’m honestly not certain what the point of this post was anymore. Though, it’s quite interesting seeing this perspective every once and a while.
---
Git gud
---
To anyone wondering, source is /r/lightroast
---
Thats your definition of maturity its also just saying ignore it....
---
We were close

Earn the seal in-game and you get a discount code to buy these pins on the bungie store.

Don’t redress it please.

Yeah it ended up a bit stale considering it was unironic but it was funny while it lasted lol I was lowkey hoping I got baited
---
Yeah I said that dumb ass
---
Ay? I only have one account
---
I blocked the last loser and you start commenting immediately? Lol whatever helps you sleep at night man.

Because you don’t aim at the ground?

... Ok.
---
holy shit
---
Wait is that actually there???
---
Yep
---
I feel such pride as a warlock
---
I walk the void with promise. This promise, to you embracing eternity, O adversary mine.
---
This is badass dude!
---
This is absolutely amazing but now I’m asking: are we the good guys?
---
No it just guarantees which handcannon that you get from the loot pool. There’s only 4 so if you put a different color in the second slot you’ll get a different handcannon
---
Yeh you have mostly get used to it and then to pace. People often are much more coordinated (it don't look like this at some first games) so you have to be carefull. Of course there is some of "git gud" but mostly. It's geting used to what's happening adn what weapons are mostly in fight.
---
Idiots that instead of giving hints just saying to get better are not better than 5lvl rookie that still learning the game. Trolls etc. Need to. Be ignored.
---
*yeah he had to grind so much food for it*
---
The armor is only added to the packages loot pool once you complete that step of the quest for the piece of armor. So if you’ve only unlocked the boots then you’ll only be able to get boots from packages until you beat the next step of the quest. Save your tokens.
---
Oh yeha the legendaries do for sure. My wife and i like to play the dc one together every now and then so we have things usually specifically set up for our games so set ups usually pretty smooth. Man i wanna get back into hobby gaming so bad now!
---
\*So i did
---
People don’t speak up about teabagging because doing so makes you a dumbass retard beta male chuck that needs to grow some fucking skin.
---
Can confirm, never take mine off
---
There's another settlement that needs our help, I'll mark it on your map.
---
What kind of clapping we talkin' here?
---
^(sorry I had to)
---
I will buck the other opinions and go with handling.
---
TIL calus is racist
---
NoW ARrIviNg aT hOrIZOn lUnAR CoLoNY
---
I need this in my house right now
---
Yeah. I hope they add more super-oriented exotics or something for pvp like One eyed mask.
---
There's nothing you can do about it. Like you said, there are no consequences for said actions. They are free to do what they want. It's not bullying, it's not a mentally unstable person, and it's not someone hoping to ruin your day like you've let it.
---
You can keep spouting the same crap all you want about it being "acceptable" and what not. But, the bottom line is that you don't have any remedies either and banning them is way to harsh of a punishment. Not only that, they can't keep track of everyone doing it because there are so many. The fact that you let it effect you as much as it does is a design on who you are, not the person bagging you.
---
It doesn't bother other people because it means jack shit. It's literally a person playing a digital character crouching over your body. That's it. That's all it is. And until you realize that, you're going to keep getting upset about something as trivial as that. It's not going to change because there is no way to actually deal with it because there are over 2 billion gamers. Not only that, people could just abuse the report button and get people banned by accusing those who haven't done it. And that's a thousand percent worse than someone teabagging.
---
This comment is under appreciated
---
Just in case anyone is not aware: you have all season to do this quest, you don't have to finish it in one week!
---
Justification? No, I never said that. It's a shitty thing to be teabagged. But, you have no argument other than the fact that your feelings got hurt. That's it. You have no basis for your argument nor do you have any ground to stand on for said argument. You're beating a dead horse. Nothing can be done about this. It's best to accept that that's just how people are, and move on. Because you're not going to accomplish anything with this. It's sad, but it's true.
---
It should be fucking deleted
---
Yeah that shit is the worst
---
You'd potentially be sat there forever if you got afk people one after the other.
---
This is fucking... amazing!
---
First download latest gpu drivers and then delete the old ones and reinstall clean, drop graphics settings in D2 to low and see how you get on. But so scan and repair from the blizzard launcher first. 
---
If nvidia gpu then the app should be installed that controls all game settings, easiest way to control the in game graphics settings.
---
I’m gonna assume you’ve bought this A51 second hand off a friend or eBay or you’d be using Alienware tech support, so you sure it worked properly before at full power? 
---
Also if second hand is it a drag instal if windows 10? That would defo be worth doing and just move the Destiny game to a separate drive if possible 
---
Also a good idea to run cpuid to monitor temps for the gpu
---
Might be worth going into bios to reset to default?? Just in case it’s be messed with for extra performance??
---
You can shoot through it plus extra damage. Barricade is the one you can't shoot through.
---
I main Titan, usually thundercrash in comp, and I'll admit I crutched the shit out of Lord of wolves, but my buddy and I went from 300 to 2100 glory in about 8 hours between the last 2 nights. Interesting how my shotgun is a better fusion rifle than his loaded question. Regardless, I'm just happy to finally have recluse/lunas/mountaintop, all at the same time. I digress, but yeah, striker Titan with OEM and whatever's meta or any random shotgun is pretty powerful.
---
She’s lonely tho.
---
Go show'em what you're made of 😁
---
They have a plantable shield. It’s called a bubble. 😒 sadly it doesn’t have weapons of light like it used to.
---
You don't need an exotic to pop a bubble or throw a bannershield.
---
Source: over 1000 hours as only a Titan main.
---
what platform you on?
---
There’s one below that. And it’s people who have 1 mote when you only need 1 for your primeval and they have enough to summon as well.
---
Failsafe&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Asher
---
Imagine being this much of a beta bitch
---
PvP I’d say
---
Warlock: Top Tree dawnblade
---
Hunter: void top or mid tree, not sure about arc yet though.
---
Titan: Too tree Solar it middle tree arc, can also go middle tree void for the bubble if you play countdown in comp.
---
Overall comes down to play style but if you only own the base game I’d say a top tree dawnblade warlock
---
this literally only happens to blade barrage hunters with shards. its the same thing that happens in blind well and mayhem. its definetly broken.
---
Its a long grind, but It took me less time than lunas, since its actually pretty easy, especially if your playing with friends who will let you get the heavy. 
---
Also tether in mayhem can lead to some easy doublekills.
---
I love those few times I jump only to glide DOWNWARD to my death.
---
Ghost, you were on board The Almighty last week, get a grip.
---
I’m sure this question has been asked but the answers that I see that relate to it have been kind of vague.. 
---
So are DLC tied to the account or will I need to buy shadowkeep and forsaken for PC also?
---
They grow up so fast
---
i have many questions
---
thank you for your service
---
I would say remove the "What is a..." grey overlay with all the question marks after the intro. Other than that looks good!
---
20 hours well spent. If this doesn't capture the essence of a voidwalker, I don't know what does.
---
I have done so many Whisper and and Zero Hour runs... Fortunately I like them.
---
I hope that one day that will be me...😢
---
just another player getting in on the titan-hate circle jerk
---
It's just magnified. It's from the solstice of heroes happening this July.
---
Play comp for maximum percentage gains. I'm at 50% double kills and 42% medals. I hate this but i think it'll be worth it
---
**^TITAN GANG^**
---
Well it is an exotic.
---
I suggest doing 1 comp match and experience the horror that is competitive. It's the reason i don't have any of those pinnacle weapons. Only thing that's decent is IB and mayhem.
---
It followed the trend of putting "i" in front of everything during the apple golden years of the early-to-mid-2000's. (iPhone, iCarly, iCafe). Its not as common but youll still see old usernames lingering about nowadays.
---
Wish we had more maps of this region. Always loved desert and snow White looking maps.
---
More important bugs need to be fixed first I assume
---
u/leftrightboi not mine but I just saw this
---
Yikes.
---
You are being offensive and aggressive. Please stop
---
Alright.
---
Yah they better keep the lunas / NF quest as it is
---
Now that's what I call a helpful *BLUEberry*
---
I’m pretty sure they’re the Season of the Drifter exotic armor, so random drop from exotic engram or milestones
---
Fun fact: in carrying a dude through the Red War, the final cutscene with the vanguard, Hawthorne, and the chosen guardian, Cayde literally walks right over that little tombstone. 
---
Despite the fact that pre-forsaken players have their own Tower instances (with Cayde alive) separate from ours, the tombstone is still there. And the little portrait at the ramen shop in the Bazaar.
---
Sorry I was just excited when I found this I might add it later when I get on destiny again tomorrow
---
Control is by far the worst game mode, and yet somehow by far the one I most often have to play.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Countdown can stay, as getting rid of it would simply mean I end up playing even more Control.
---
I am so sick of Control.
---
Yeah it was bad, it is what it is lol
---
Stopped at the super kills melee kills and grenade kills part, fuck that noise
---
Do you have the 2 LEDs on the back that light up as you get headshots?
---
Wow, you truly are mentally challenged. Sorry bud, that must be difficult.
---
I'd rather fight a team of 6 Titans that broke the game to have both Peregrine Greaves and Skullfort on than a team of Warlocks just so I don't have to get Handheld Supernova'd.
---
Whats new light?
---
Yeassss gooooooddddd
---
they get osiris and warmind dlc for free nd increased light level but forsaken is just a visitable place
---
Getting put against four stacks, being expected to carry a bunch of level 20's playing their first ever crucible game, playing Control 80% of the team with a team who don't seem to understand that you kinda need to capture points, and being put against players who are clearly far, far better than you.
---
Going win-loss is okay. Everything else about Crucible is a fucking drain on my mental health.
---
I’d like my warlock gear to be more feminine tho. I know, they should also have body type as something you get to pick for your character. Yay everyone is happy.
---
Turn its rounds down. Makes stomping/getting stomped not take so long.
---
I would wait just so you don't have to learn mechanichs that are about to change
---
The "I'm a college student, ergo I'm an expert" argument. Wonderful.
---
*WRRRYYYYYYYYYY*
---
“Oh we’re about to lose a franchise? Kill off the best character!”
---
Play now, grab some exotics and continue playing in sep :p
---
Failsafe 🍆 Asher
---
Ram
---
I did call tech support, they said it was no problem with the computer. Purely the game.
---
Whats unfortunate is how well written a lot of Asher Mir's dialogue is. As well as the voice actors levels of emotion within them. Whats SUPER unfortunate is that we never get ANY of this with strikes. We literally have to go idle for hours in order to grasp his entire personality.
---
Observe: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfk3Mvmse94](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfk3Mvmse94)
---
My favorite lines being one near the beginning, and the final line in the video. Incredible voice acting.
---
*This is how I know I am a coward...*
---
This gives a whole new meaning to Titan skating lol.
---
Yeah this has appeared on a bunch of different snipers. Unfortunately my Sole Survivor with ornament has a gambit coin over the scope though so RIP.
---
Including Asher&gt;Asher?
---
😳😳😳
---
#YES
---
Hey i probably can't help but you should try the d2 companion app :)
---
Open a group with the server your playing on EU/Asia/Na and stuff
---
the name of the raid and probably that you're new. And then you have to invite just the people into your frireteam
---
by writing /invite Battletag. If its still bugged you have tio tpye /add friend battletag :)
---
wow wow
---
Is that a 1v1 challenge?
---
When. V O I D L I G H T.
---
It seems like a cheap trick, switching to opposite personalities and thus, _humor_. But her “good cop” personality is so well delivered and written it’s both hilarious and heartbreaking at times. She really is a good character imo.
---
&gt;Unpopular opinion
---
It shows
---
I’ve gotten at least 6 exotics drop as floor loot this season. Every single one of them was from year 1. Can I borrow your RNG?
---
But my fireteam never wants to do it...
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Do all of Spiders daily bounties and do patrols/events on Tangled Shore until they're all complete with both chest/resource farming. Usually I can max out in an hour or so if I'm being lazy. 😉
---
Warlock is the best jump!!!!
---
 forgot to add to add a 4th Head for Blinking Voidwalkers😈😈😈
---
It's just weird for me because my warlock is my only male character so it feels like I basically have 3 females.
---
Quote some random redditor i saw last week:
---
*-“it’s psion fan fiction”*
---
Would gladly share the love of it if I could
---
ok thanks
---
The stupid vendor guy at EDZ ruined it for me while I was still waiting to start the Forsaken campaign. He had some dialogue in remembrance of Cayde. Completely ruined the plot.
---
Special and heavy ammo does drop you know, plus there is giving hand.
---
Red bars take one shot, knights take 2 and ogres take 3, the only way youd run out of ammo is if you are bad with grenade launchers and ammo never dropped
---
I think you actually triggered them here too
---
Yo why the fuck am I crying right now 😭
---
It sucks that people are like this, if you're on pc I'd be happy to play through a few with you
---
Yeah tried to make fun, actually made a pointless shitshow ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Theres a difference between what you see and feel and networking tests.
---
I have problems like this maybe 3 games a day. Most games are stable for me.
---
If you get a decent Bygones or Blast Furnace, it'll more or less outdo Broadsword
---
On the other hand, if you do end up wanting to get broadsword, try starting the Luna's howl quest at the same time so you'll get them around the same time depending how good you are with the Luna's quest steps
---
lfg on companion app
---
If you are talking about the one with the 3 plates to turn heroic then yes i had to do it as well :/. I used a warlock with phoenix protocol and made it heroic cuz i was able to get my super back and sit on the plates. If hunter id try tether with orpheus rigs and if titan id try bubble with helm of saint 14
---
What am I missing?  Is blink an exceptionally good ability to use in Gambit?
---
The reason I think this won’t happen is because we’ve never actually engaged in combat with another human(humanoid) character. 
---
Bungie even had Uldren swallowed by a meatball followed by a fade to black to avoid active combat with a human.
---
It is possible but its a bloody headache. What platform are ya on?
---
Oh shoot, really?
---
I dont allow more than ONE titan in my groups.  They are a detriment. They make everything worse if you have more than one.
---
oh my GOD i love this
---
"When you whisper to the Void, does it whisper back? No? To me either..."
---
Hey man, i'm just a salty gamer.
---
I mean you are not wrong
---
I forgot that mechanic was there. I miss the Vault. 
---
BUNGIE! MAKE MORE PARTS OF THE GAME WHERE PLAYERS CAN INTERACT WITH RAIDS/DUNGEONS!
---
ILL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK
---
I’d pay real money to have her as the voice for my ghost. Call it “ghost hacks” or something in the eververse store. Have all the characters! Or at least good ones. Could you imagine Shaxx screaming at you during a serious cutscene? I’d love it!
---
Likewise, I'm not really sure I get it either. I understand the slaughter of siblings (cool band name?) over the deletion of characters but the frog saying nae nae?
---
Well I have max glimmer from just doing the normal grind. Doing daily's and weekly's. Playing the game etc. So right now I have 100k which I will buy all the chests after reset. 
---
That will drop me down to what 30k or even less? So then I'll turn in the bounties and get 2500 each. Then I can get back 45k from all three characters.
---
I had a titan teabag me after killing me with LoW. I preceded to give that scum no mercy. You don't BM people if you're playing with cheese, it's just rude.
---
Pit? What pit? There is no pit!
---
I mean, if we're all linking Discords for raids, feel free to hit me up for another as well! (I only know Leviathan, but I'd be willing to learn others). My Discord is Roachy#8201
---
Ballet farts?
---
Great  now fusions will get nerfed 😩😂😂😂
---
I want weapons of light back
---
New player here, I’m currently lvled hunter and next will be warlock. But titan I will create after the new light, so I can experience everything new! “Happy”
---
This is awesome!! Post this to Twitter @bungie 👀
---
Pretty sure! I just remember the bright green standing out to me and in turn happened to remember your name.  I was a hunter running around in full IB armor and Cerberus+1, although I wouldn't expect you to remember that lol.
---
With the weekly bonus you get for playing comp each week, even if you don't like PvP. If you play the games for the weekly bonus, you should get to 2100 before the season ends. The only gun which a PvE player may not be able to obtain is Not forgotten. I know this because even tho I am a PvP player only, I am a solo player and I really hate playing the comp playlist. So all I done was played the games for the weekly bonus and before the season was over, I was around 2200.
---
Tractor and middle tree?
---
I actually had this happen last night! I solo queued into a match against a full stack and Saladin had to end up calling it. I was really worried it was going to break my streak.
---
Nah, Lord of Wolves is broken AF right now
---
It's all about target acquisition. Keep your reticle at the legs or waist when firing that bit further away.
---
As for taking too long to charge, practice precharging in pve. Stay in cover and anticipate your enemies location using the radar as you charge and then leave cover as the burst fires. With practice this becomes muscle memory and fusions start becoming deadly. Way more strategic than other options.
---
do a hunter next!!!!!!!
---
this looks awesome.  Why doesnt Bungie do this across the board?  
---
very good job man.
---
Could have more... :)
---
For PvP, I'd recommend Transversive Steps. Wings of Sacred Dawn are great for Attunement of Sky, but that's gonna make you a suspended target in PvP. Phoenix Protocol is great for Well of Radiance, but that's a little useless in PvP. Transversive Steps make you super mobile and you'll be able to dash around quickly. It makes a lot of difference in your super as well.
---
Me with Vex Mythoclast on the 1st Destiny.
---
So are you!
---
No, the armor in the pictures are ornamented with season 3 ornaments
---
Transgressive Steps? :P
---
I took great joy in shutting down all the cowards running that fucking gun in iron banner.
---
Doesnt seem that bad on console, looks worse on PC.
---
This brought a smile to my face
---
Thats mad. Didnt even see the boop. Thought it was a close Range weapon?
---
I haven't stopped using it since I completed the grind... Holy hell. I hated it and it took forever. Lunas, and mountain top are far out of my skill range.
---
Why bungo do us like this 😂
---
Been away from destiny, is this like the equivalent of giant dad
---
Yup. I knew it right away and it legit made me so happy.
---
Drang was about the only one I used.  But the side arm perk mention just goes along with the 'moon' s haunted' meme I saw.
---
I tea bag everyone I kill that uses LoW.
---
They're a random drop from killing any Scorn Baron. I recommend farming the Fanatic in the daily heroic story mission "Nothing left to say".
---
Yep was doing it with my luxurious toast emote too :)
---
Pretty good 1. &amp; 2. roll‘s but the perks...damn:) Maybe have a look for outlaw + rampage if you wanna got a nice PvE handcanon.
---
Its weird some you can see some you can't.
---
Ya but this space magic wall that don’t break when bomb go boom
---
 
---
.
---
That's actually really good, what gun is that for?
---
Absolutely C U R S E D
---
😂
---
True. I just need to unlock the green and red runes.
---
You need to buy everthing for every platform seperatly.
---
If you shoot the banner spot long enough..
---
Prodigal cloak would like a word
---
The name blueberry come from the fact that teammates that are not fireteam members show up as blue dots on the radar..... 
---
blue dot=blueberry
---
yes it is probably cause of bloom :) ty modern fps genre, i hope whoever invented bloom will die in hell
---
In the UK reset is at 6pm
---
You have to form a fireteam, this should not be an issue.
---
You might as well grab patrols while you're at it. The ones marked with triangles are the simple "kill enemies" type.
---
Good guy calus
---
I'm not even good enough to pull that off.
---
 Oof... Remind me to never play you on my hunter 😂
---
Ohhh ..you see i didn't know that ...i was thinking it was gonna be match made so i was worried thanks for that info..
---
I'm doing the Thorn quest and I was getting desperate at the beginning until I realised I had that helmet. This, plus Sturm, is how I get a 6% every quickplay.
---
The Heroic version of Zero Hour would like to have a word with you
---
Skill &gt; class. They had enough skill to compensate for a disability
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
Retold tale, can only get it from the dreaming city or augmented weapon from Ada
---
No problem. Good luck in it 👍 hope you get a good team that doesn't start it without banners xD
---
I know they show up as blue, and that's why I call them blueberries.  I just find it funny that it's become the universal term now.
---
Your not wrong, I have used it and every clip I posted to reddit with It has been downvoted to 0, that's why I made this
---
Yeah googled it myself. No im not „young“ just a non native english speaker. But hey enjoy your downvotes kiddo
---
Polaris Lance. You get it from the Nascent Dawn quest on Mars.
---
Thx for the info:) any good roll suggestions ?
---
I remember when I finsished the story and the game told me the “Vault of Glass” was unlocked and I had no idea it was a 6 man activity, so I went in. Got confused by all the hard enemies and plates, but somehow, SOMEHOW I glitched past the door or something, I still to this day have no clue how I got past. Then I tried solo’ing the Templar beginning part to no avail...ah good times
---
I don't like either of those sets
---

---
...what's your point? The game changed and your upset about it? There is something called a journal and/or a blog that this type of post is more suitable for. 
---
What are you mad about? Of course you are behind because you haven't played in over a year. You already said your friends are helping you out. So... Did you have a question or...?
---
This is the correct take. Asher is substantially better than Failsafe.
---
Yeah, Strange Terrain used to be tied for most common nightfall, but now it's been gone for 9 weeks. [Nightfall tracking comment I saw](https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/c5blmt/d2_weekly_reset_thread_20190625/es0syrf/)

**All** Eververse items will be sold for both Silver and Bright Dust at least once throughout the season.

I know id just lime to see that happen with shadowkeep.
---
I just want my Errant Knight set back again... I can't wait for transmogs...hopwfully they'll be retroactive for equipment you unlocked but no longer have access to?
---
Might as well go for other titles, that's what I did. Cursebreaker is pretty nice.
---
Even if you have the silver/bright dust, it says you cannot purchase this ornament unless you own the annual pass.
---
OI! the little raidio is my favorite
---
/r/destinyfashion has a megathread with images of most year 2 armor sets, and also many stylish guardians to draw inspiration from.

which subclass?
---
Nice one, thanks!
---
Had no idea that subreddit existed, sounds perfect! Thanks 👍🏻
---
Really, just make is so Release the Wolves cannot be turned on in Crucible. That fixes everything without nerfing it to hell for pve.
---
Stayed up till fucking 5 am finishing the god damn quest line, it’s now 10:40 and I have to work at 12 so I barely slept

Iron Banner also brings out everyone’s toxicity

You also can't acquire the weapon without the Annual Pass.

Until the next surprising, low-key meta rears it's ugly head and the sub blows up with complaints again. The upcoming change comes sometime this summer, so I give it a month after the fact until everyone finds something else that shakes things up too much.
---
NA PC here. Stuck at white "signing in" screen.
---
Sorry, mobile
---
Vestian dynasty?
---
This is because the Ornament belongs to the Season Of Opulence, hence the Seasonal corner icon.
---
i literally said that in the comment you replied to.
---
I’m not crying you’re crying
---
True, but peregrine is a lot easier
---
The flashpoints are on a rotation btw lol
---
i think they probably meant impossible specifically to trying the old tactics that worked against these enemies. but they never said anything like "we'll have to change our tactics" in the intro to the vdoc which is why it comes across as weird.
---
Where'd you get thattt?
---
Yikes, that's a long response.
---
I get what you mean though.
---
It’s already in collections so you’re fine to delete it
---

---
Highly reccommend. I got one with Opening Shot /Moving Target / High Cal/Ricochet/Light Mag  : Hitmark/Crossfire/Sureshot. While it may not be the best gun for everyone this thing is  a beast. I dropped a spring grip on it cause I run a fast build...10/1/6  . I consider myself very low end player in PVP type games. but whenever I've gone against people . if I can hit my shots after 2 they usually run for cover.  I had the Rampage/opening shot roll, but it didn't feel as good.
---
Swords randomly drop from the boss
---
Oh it's entirely laziness. When faced with patch notes, or asking reddit, reddit takes less time and energy and often more rewards.
---
Eververse
---
Is that a mother fuckin Dragon ball z reference!? (I know it is)
---
We can all agree the forsaken gear in general looks awful.
---
as long as you see it in your collections (armor -&gt; factions), even if you can't pick it up because of random rolls, it'll be eligible for ornamentation. so yeah you can dismantle.
---
How many times did you have to visit Ada-1?
---
What ornament is that?
---
Can't on PC East Coast NJ
---
Could also be that. If anyone was considering buying shadowkeep and was turned away by “impossible content” I don’t want them in the game anyways. There’s enough brain dead people in lfg as is
---
Good lord dude. Go outside for a bit. Get some sun.
---
Where is that emote from? I’ve never seen it sold
---
Was it a random drop our some kind of chalice combo?
---
Thanks :)
---
Thank you :)
---
I’m over a thousand hours in and I don’t have one, can’t say I’ve really tried, you on the other hand have given D2 some whoopass
---
I was about to ask if that was no land beyond. So you probably love some of the Gambit weapons like Bygones. Those are some 1920s style shaders.
---
Seemed to be a random drop I didn’t open the chest and just got it after defeating the boss and also seems to be rare also as I was the only one who got it
---
still waiting for this one  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f311XTtqPgc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f311XTtqPgc)

Now imagine what shadowkeep is gonna be like on release day.
---
Cursebreaker and Dredgen are among the easiest I think.

My bad for not being in the loop on that. As a day 1 veteran I can honestly say I've never been called a kinderguardian before. I guess I deserved the down votes lol
---
Haha no I was just giving you a hard time. There’s kinderguardian, taken tots, crota’s kids, etc.
---
Totally agree. One of the head devs is from old school wow and he talked about exactly what you were asking for :)
---
Take my upvote.

Blueberries...
---
Got catalyst my first run, chugging along on the kills. Supposed to need 500 :(

Cursebreaker is easy if you’re 600, just make sure to be there to get all of the ahamkara bones and corrupted eggs so you don’t have to wait an extra 6 weeks

Um, those aren't hand cannons.
---
Skyrim Bonemold armor be like
---
I like that you looked around like "What just happened?" 😂 😂
---
It's the best kinetic for everything. Why run a hand cannon or a scout when it does both?
---
Open. Chests
---
PVE:Malfeasance 
---
PvP: Ace
---
You're not wrong. I scored a Skullfort with the perk that melee kills give super energy, so it synergizes pretty hard with mid tree.
---
I don't get it
---
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
Oh frick, u right
---
I totally forgot that!  
---
Consider this thread closed.
---
Recluse is worth the grind.i wish I was better at PvP but in PvE it’s too damn good
---
It's an alt, my other char is at 711 power
---
U r welcome sir
---
Yeah well did you know that Taniks has no House. He kneels before no banner, owes allegiance to no Kell. He is a murderer, and very good at what he does. I have been tracking him since Wolves broke their chains, yes? Now Taniks works for Wolf pack ...but not for long
---
How did I know it was bottom tree striker before I clicked..
---
Huh
---
And then you realize the game only REALLY supports teams of 3.
---
Dawnblade movement speed is literally the fastest movement speed in the game without ANY super consumption
---
 MAHVELOUS
---
Yeah, that seems high. It should go for less, at least on consoles.
---
You don't main a Titan lol the Slam consumes a shit ton
---
Sick beans  brother
---
I'm not sure what the xbox store looks like, but on PC, when you are looking at the store page, it says what is in each collection when you scroll down. It says that the complete collection contains all current content, but no pre order content such as shadowkeep.
---
Return of the Tapir
---
It’s Destiny 2 plus all of the expansions
---
I’m a fan of thorn personally. I just really like 150s. Also hitting 2 taps is sooooo satisfying
---
Im so sorry
---
Same
---
Yeah, expecting people to deal a baseline amount of DPS that is necessary to succeed is one thing, but parroting some weapon recommendation as a requirement without understanding why is another thing.
---
We need the numbers! Remember, THIS IS WAR with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold
---
I don’t usually see dawnblades moving around much usually it’s jump in the air activate super JUSTICE RAINS FROM ABOVE then the flop on the ground and floof about like warlocks do
---
*pops iron skin*
---
NOTE: I meant if they were two separate games, would forsaken have more content?
---
Not sure what god roll is but I found mine after one that had feeding frenzy. Surprised it that could be a perk, but I refuse to roll another for now.
---
And all of these ornaments require the annual pass to purchase? It just seems strange to me that the pinnacle weapon ornaments work differently than other ornaments.
---
It looks a lot like darkest dungeon
---
That is gorgeous, well done!
---
Time to die and prepare to get revived as a guardian
---
When you log in should come up as a pop up

Whoa
---
You have to complete a run of heroic menagerie with a fully upgraded chalice.

Yeah ik I was just stating the obvious

Ps4 grinders?? I’m also trying for recluse but solo queing comp is going to give me a stroke

Indeed woa

Alright, gt is facemenguyen, wont be on till tommorow likely

Its for the season in terms of the big quest.

I have 5G internet via Ethernet to my PC, believe me its most likely Battle Net being ass, because my is slow af to
---
Thank you. Hopefully I can get that today.
---
With Accurized and a Range MW, you can make it work. Slap a Rampage Spec on it and go on a killing spree.
---
At least credit the photo you stole.
---
It’s all amazing, keep it up! Do you know where these assets are? I’ve always wanted to get into modelling so I was hoping to put Cayde in some scenes myself. Keep up the amazing work!
---
Thank you for adding this.  Falloutplays deserves the credit.
---
*cocks moon* ghosts haunted
---
Depending on what you think is fun, not long at all. If you choose just to do the Season Of Opulence then you should be good. And exotic drops are relatively the same.
---
Pew pew pew
---
So two questions, forgive me for being slow. 
---
1. If I buy a PC after Shadowkeep launches, will I be able to transfer all progress from my Xbox account to my PC?
---
2. When playing on PC, can I now play with my friends on Xbox once Shadowkeep launches?
---
That’s what I feared. Nothing getting exotics from D1 is bad enough, knowing I won’t get them in D2 either just hurts
---
Oof ow Titan man
---
But there are still quest exotics you can get.
---
Taniks has no House. He kneels before no banner, owes allegiance to no Kell. He is a murderer, and very good at what he does. I have been tracking him since Wolves broke their chains, yeees? Now Taniks works for Wolf Pack, but not for long.
---
Think it's a random drop at the end of warden of nothing nightfall
---
The Hive are sending an Ogre!
---
As someone who mained a titan for most of D2, I can’t help but wonder when people are going to learn to run away from that super. They have a lot of armor and every kill gives them health back. Unless you’re rocking wardcliff just fucking run.  Unless he was right on top of you when you started running he won’t catch you, and if he does he wasted so much of his super trying to catch you that he can’t chain 11 kills like this vid. 
---
Not to take away from OP, that was a great streak, dude. Sometimes blueberries just gonna...blueb?
---
Why not do it then
---
It's the Nightfall exclusive from Warden of Nothing, it's the only one of its archetype in the game.
---
Oh ok. Im soloplayer so no nightfall for me.
---
Nice, looks pretty neat btw
---
This is epic
---
What?
---
We had a little baby 266 Titan in my clan's IB match last night. He was on the enemy team and basically hid in the back of the map the entire game.  We won, even though the other 5 were really doing their best.
---
I unironically love this handcannon, and it can 2 tap if you land both double headshots( doesn't always work depending on the enemies' resilience) but it's mostly luck and not really a skill based gun, it is a very satisfying gun to use in my experience however.
---
Google the Marasenna triumphs and they'll show up easily. They're easy to grab, probably an Esoterickk video or two
---
It's a rare-ish drop from the warden of nothing nightfall.
---
For reference, I bought d2 with expansions and Forsaken for 30 about 4 months ago. About a month later, the same bundle was 20 usd.
---
 I later added the annual pass for 25.

If you go to see the spider you can buy lumen with legendary fragments!!

Yeah, because saying a state of being does not exist when it is well documented to exist in the scientific literature is one aspect of saying science isn't real?

its a piss joke...

Thank you!

God I miss NLB
---
I'm lazy
---
Playing quickplay as a striker is a great time ngl
---
Lmao thanks man
---
One eyed mask lmao. The super is just like this
---
The hunter helmet though, love the spider eyes.
---
You've snagged yourself a Nightfall exclusive! They're pretty bloody rare, especially a curated roll like this one. Warden's Law is the only "double hit" hand cannon in the game, so it's definitely a good novelty weapon. I'll be honest, it's not exactly a monster in PvP or PvE, but it's certainly not bad, and it is a lot of fun. Definitely a gun to hang on to, even if it's just to leave in your vault
---
What is a lumen?
---
Can you explain the purpose of the vault of glass and how it functions?
