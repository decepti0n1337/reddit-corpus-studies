In my experience, the more I play the more clearly I'll see my mistakes down the road, but also over confidence is a slow and insidious killer, I try to do the 980 NF just to humble myself and make me play conservatively. though I fail miserably at the NF to makes me feel/do better in more realistic tasks
---
---
---
That's some pretty bad artifacting. You sure it's exclusive to destiny 2? Your video card might be dying. Undo any overclocks (if you have) ASAP
---
Try switching your jump mode. There is o e of them that goes higher
---
Explain this tactic, please.
---
What happens when there are too many enemies around your ally to revive them without dying?
---

---
Edit: Read it wrong. I interpreted it as the teammate is shooting enemies that are around the ghost, not that the teammate is next to the ghost shooting enemies.
---
A friend on mine once got 29, how people invade so well is beyond me
---
Or if you're lucky
---
+1 Enhancement Core
---
Yeah that just happens in Destiny 2. Also cant seem to run Modern warfare but pretty sure it's not related. Can run other games fine and could run COD up until last update
---
I think he got all my stuff ... and yours and yours ...
---
...don't instakill the boss and wait for two named knights to spawn
---
What weapons did you use?
---
No problem! Message me on here, it‚Äôs fastest that way
---
Oh and as for overclocks, it has a factory clock but I removed that too and even underclocked with no effect
---
Bungie needs to get rid of the lootboxes entirely, not put more worthwhile shit in them.
---
Funny you say that, I've just started my warlock class and I'm really liking it a lot.
---
Ive definitely gotten the "death heals primeval" message when killed by npc enemies surfing an invasion. As far as I know, they weren't close to me and didn't cause any damage at all. Its common enough that I assumed any death was attributed to the invader.
---
No step on snek

---
Then check that HDR is disabled from D2
---
Everyone should go back to 2010 and play Left 4 Dead. Don‚Äôt rez, GO. 
---
3 players in a strike is better than 1. (Plus in NF, waiting for a rez is boring. I make tea now).
---
The option is grayed out and defaulted to off
---
This happened to me in hunter. I stayed on one point, and every time the enemy would try and take it I'd throw a grenade. They would die before they noticed.
---
Definitely a fair point. I personally prefer a controller, (mostly because I haven't put the time in to adjust to mouse and keyboard), so I usually play crucible on PS4 and everything else on PC. Cross save is great.
---
I assume you played it through the strike playlist? You have to select the mission in the titan map, bear in mind it is not the normal strike. I hope you have friends, because i dont think it is possible to solo.
---
Yes army was mistake, make lots money now tho, yes missed good season, but what is greenie weeeeeeniee
---
AIGHT, you won. Are you a boog boi?
---
please tell me you are
---
just happened to me lol. can't help myself
---
GOod job, you grabbed a thesaurus. Big words don't make you intelligent bud.
---
My first exotic was a riskrunner. (I‚Äôve only been playing for 3 months). I really like this gun, still running it on my warlock.
---
Underated comment.
---
To be fair I haven't even found the mission to go find saint 14

If you think any of those words were too obscure, I weep for whatever education system you suffered through.

Yeah they are easier than scorn, but all the hydra explosions and teleporting minotaurs are annoying

Ok: I hate hunters but that was badass!

Max range with quick draw opening shot

The impossible machines also. So satisfying to get both ionic blink and landfall, plus it looks good.

Random chance, yes. But I played for two hourse. I litterally killed at least 500 enemies

Oh damn

fuckin Vorgeth is what prevents me from getting a solo flawless. I've gotten solo, and flawless, just never both in the same run

I'm ass tbh haha but thanks

Ya but unlike with worm you aren't being rushed to do damage. So you can still take your time and get hits in.

Goldtusk is Quickfang with extra perks?

Going to change the shaders to be a space ranger.

And if you wanted Year 1 weapons you should have been playing in Year 1.

Ah yes because if I put it somewhere else it makes it not a [repost](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyMemes/comments/egxi87/very_competent_warlock_indeed/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

He might but you'd never know
---
Or year 2
---
I don‚Äôt know if its just the red war but start there
---
Is that a good gun? I dismantled like 3 of them in 2 days. I should try things before dismantling them. I don't like sidearms tbh, except the new one from the sundial.
---
I want Quickfang specifically, dude. Never gonna settle for less. This is a crusade.
---
Can‚Äôt agree more.
---
Perfection hahaüòÖ
---
ngl if I was on the other team I would‚Äôve shat my pants and be so pissed off. That was AMAZING
---
Oh forgot to say. I don‚Äôt eat crayons. Do not use that shoulder charge shit as it pisses me off. I prefer to tomohwak you from far away. I eat pencils is what I‚Äôm trying to say
---
yeah, we cant have it going the way of my baby (pocket infinity) üò≠
---
You DO want goldtusk, it‚Äôs just better, because it‚Äôs a year 2 weapon that can get random rolls.
---
As for quickfang, it‚Äôs one of those weapons that as of shadowkeep and new light seems to have disappeared. It is allegedly in the loot pool, but it‚Äôs incredibly rare. 
---
Ive played 1000 hours since New light and not gotten one class specific sword from the open world.
---
That's a whole extra year!
---
Exactly
---
Yeah right now I'm just getting to know warlock and stuff but I'm really enjoying it a lot and trying to play something other than Titan because I mean honestly I just like the subclasses for warlock more IMO
---
Yeah lemme just go get my Delorean real quick.
---
Bruh yall act like i know everything about reddit i saw a meme and i shared it, why make it such a big deal yall so toxic. And it will stay up fuck ur feelings.

My chest has 65 and I haven‚Äôt seen other armor with higher stats just yet but I‚Äôm only 944

Thank you! I don't play much titan, I much prefer hunter or warlock. I was using top tree sentinel, so no shoulder charge :)
---
Oh didn't know that.
---
Death by Scorn is a monster sidearm
---
Exactly. But I at least want the OPTION to have it. I‚Äôve seen 2,000 titans with Crown Splitter. Gimme my class sword so I can weeb out in crucible.
---
All sidearms are auper nutty right now. Since Recluse was nerfed, sidearms are the best primary now
---
I love morons like you that try to police the weapons people are using. You remind me of the little old lady over the back fence, spying on me, telling me I‚Äôm immoral and going to hell because I smoke a joint. Get a fucking life.
---
the quest sucks but thats the point, just get rid of rocket launcher final blows and its fine, also the power level thing is the point of ib, if you don‚Äôt like it just grind for higher power

Heck yeah man I promise you won't be disappointed üòÇ

I t  d o e s n ‚Äò t w o r k. That‚Äôs the point.

There‚Äôs apps you can download I.E. Little Light, Ishtar Commander or the Destiny Companion app. They‚Äôll tell you were you can go or what to do for the weekly milestones. Like bounties for people, 3 Gambit matches ( I just do Prime matches because it‚Äôs less time, strikes, nightfalls, whatever planet has the flashpoint that week, etc.
---
You‚Äôve reached the part where it‚Äôs all grinding for better gear. You‚Äôll be max Light in no time
---
I completely understand. It used to send me into a rage, but just vexes me a little nowadays. Just because I've overcome it doesnt mean its satisfying to kill the asshole that did it though.
---
honestly as soon as I realized that everyone is crowding heavy to finish the quest I switched to nova bomb and got so many double and triple kills ahaha
---
Because look at it. It‚Äôs the hunter class specific weapon that isn‚Äôt refashioned to suit the Emperor‚Äôs ‚Äúmodest‚Äù tastes.

Telling people what they should and shouldn‚Äôt do is starting conflict, pal. Especially when you‚Äôre telling them something as toxic as you‚Äôre ruining other player‚Äôs experience. Pull your damn head in. Shut your mouth. Go about your days and leave other people alone.

Good to know people other than me are still running Drang and Sturm.

Just use wardcliff. First game with that step I got 5 kills with it.

I used top tree void hunter. The invis is clutch. The sidearm Lonesome with a god roll last perdition, and deathbringer. It took 6-7 games to get it.
---
I can‚Äôt agree more. I went up against 3 oem titans in survival FREELANCE. One of them used a shotgun but the other two were using jotunn. And I know that jotunn isn‚Äôt that OP but when you try to get into gunfights you just instantly die.
---
That‚Äôs how I‚Äôm feeling this round of IB. Everyone just runs around using anything that one shots. Might as well create a hardcore play mode and have everything one shot.
---
Lol fair enough. I don‚Äôt know anything about any encounter haha
---
Anybody that doesn't bring their LL below 750 gets reported, in my book. I kept a full set of 750 armor and crap weapons just in case, and glad I did (unused revelry/solstice armor, and NF exclusive weapons like Duty Bound that are now useless, for example).
---
Pro tip: you can pull a 27 LL class item under the leveling tab in the armor collections, to bring down your LL below 750, as long as everything else you equip is 750. I've seen a lot of people using the Halloween even mask too since it's 0 LL.

You can get the lantern of osiris from osiris which is this season's artifact. The if you get tons and tons of exp it will grant you bonus light! As well as that you can also get perks from it to put on your guns.

i imagine a grin under that helmet. XD
---
I strongly disagree with you here. Since the game joined my Steam library, I've enjoyed over 300 hours of Destiny 2. The game has some funky bugs, but so does every game out there - especially considering how vast and expansive this title is. It's a lot easier on everyone if we just laugh at these things rather than remain bitter and hold it against the artists who work so hard to please us. Also remember that this base game content is free to play, so bugs originating from these zones won't be of high priority.
---
You will come across some real gems, and then there are those ones like "feces f*cker" and those ones just make me die a little inside

One specific quest requires up to 25 kills with several weapon types, ending with the rocket launcher. Then you will be able to spend your coins.

u shouldve immediantly went for a spawn point u were one kill away from S E V E N T H  C O L U M

TBH what I did was as soon as the match starts 
---
I think there‚Äôs at least 30 seconds until it spawns and I just camped 
---
Got the heavy and mowed down the first dude I saw. Then I would fuck around get some kills and then go back and check the timer. Usually it starts at like 1:30 or 1 minute and do it again. 
---
If you are smart you are sure to get the first drop if you kill a couple of dudes and just camp.

This had to have happened in Florida and we all know it

Hunter bc I enjoy the quickness, mobility, and utility as a solo player. And bc invis res is a nice crutch in a team.

From the nightfall card that xur has. Go on the card and set it to 50 decrease light level. Then do 3 nightfalls (not the ordeal the nightfall playlist on the far right). I suggest getting a team

Fusion range is definitely all over the place, but the class as a whole isn't terribly unbalanced. Erentil is obviously a stand-out, but there are plenty of weapons that perform far better than they should outside of the weapon type's normal range. If Erentil is a problem because it holds a good TTK at ridiculous range, then Blast Furnace, Dustrock, and Antiope are in the same category and yet I don't see many people complaining about those.

I didn't know about this, thanks for the info, been wanting that sword.

I swear it did when it first came out because when the game mode where weapons do increased damage I remember thinking, whoa that does over 300 DMG now instead of 200 something.
---
Wow really warlock is the most shittiest character on the game. Let me just fly and float around the map bc I don‚Äôt like confrontation with real players. I shit on kids all day everyday with my hunter too. But thanks for the love and support. üòò

This is some cringe. You ran up to an afk dude in crucible and killed him, and then posted it on reddit to try to farm upvotes. Cringe.

Keep it up!! You can do it! Do it for the samurai!!
---
There are so many whiners in this game since it went free on steam.  Im surprise they havent quit yet.
---
I don‚Äôt get the problem.
---
It's not. You have to be using bottom tree solar in case you forgot to use that
---
Burning Maul, not hammer of sol. But I did not expect that.
---
Lol
---
I can try
---
Ye like it just doing bounties and bounties and bounties now.
---
There has to be more ways added to get pinnacle gear.
---
Shoot it and see what happens. I dare ya
---
The gear does look good. The last part of the quest is just so toxic though. Bungie really messed up with making rocket launcher kills a quest step. They need to steer away requiring specific weapon kills and move more toward zone capturing and kills in general.
---
No, it means that you yourself is a Titan at heart
---
Pair Anteus with a shotgun and you basically never lose. When you slide the shield blocks bullets and abilities, so you can always get off the first damaging shot, so with shotguns you basically never lose an engagement. As for super it is really down to preference. I like middle tree striker cause of inertia override giving a damage boost whenever you slide over ammo blocks. Anteus can also reflect supers. It reflects dawn blade and blade barrage, and timed well you can survive nova bombs. You can reflect golden gun, but it will still kill you even though you reflect it.
---
T
---
That‚Äôs going to be next week in mayhem stealing all the supers with Antaeus wards
---
My ‚Äúluck‚Äù
---
Yeah that part has sucked the super kills were holding me up too and the rocket kills weren't as bad as I thought they were because I use the wardliff coil which is really good for that part of the quest
---
Thanks, lol.
---
*I like those odds.*
---
Yea l reposted with the pic to the email
---
&gt;Light level enabled?!?! Playing against someone who can take more than 1 headshot (not in super) and walk away is crap!! I get banner is a pinnacle thing, but playing against a person who is basically max light, but his armor has the exact load out as me, but because he‚Äôs 20+ light above me he can take 2 headshots is not ok!
---
it's IB this is ok, it's part of the design of this game mode. :) vent all you want and go back to the grind.
---
That‚Äôs fucked.

Don't touch my boy!

Handling and stability are so useless on pc it hurts to ever get them

I thought so too! But the 2 teams for a QP match got glitched into Last Wish!
---
How the fuck Arbalest is OP? It is just basically sniper rifle than needs to charge AND alerts everyone around that it is charging. If you think it is OP, then every sniper rifle in the game must be too, because theya re easier to use.
---
It's a Rapid Hit + KC Duke
---
Higher power and burst damage are the solution. Wait for the barrier champ to heal once after which it feels like it has a short cooldown before putting up another barrier. I think i was using crooked fang LFR in void singe for this and it eventually worked out.

Just saw a post that perfectly encapsulates what that entire subreddit is about...
---
Guy accidentally deleted all of their mod components. One of the top comments is someone vigorously agreeing and calling out Bungie for being terrible and lazy and how they almost deleted an entire stack of hundreds of cores due to how incompetent Bungie is! 
---
Except you can't delete entire stacks of cores. 
---
Perfectly explains the subreddit. Whining and complaining about problems that don't exist and thinking you know better than the developer.
---
*laughs in keybord and mouse*
---
congrats!!! of course is an achivement! and a great gun! enjoy!
---
I thought the same, but eventually I got it. Took me like a year of playing the game and getting better at it, but I got it. So dont be afraid, you will make it one day

"Ive got books to colour and crayons to eat" - titan
---
They just sent me one for all the midget porn I watch :(
---
They need to be legendaries from original gambit
---
The sound of doom, terror and crayons stuck in the brain of the Sweet Business user.
---
PvP can be quite casual. Tell you what though, the lag I've been having doesn't help.
---
There are plenty of circumstances/activities where rezzing someone is the stupidest thing you can do. 
---
I mean, try that on the Leviathan's Breath variant of The Arms Dealer. You go stand still to rez your buddy, and the missiles on the ship above wind up. You may get the rez in, you may even escape yourself (probably not) but the person you just "helped" gets nuked from orbit, literally.
---
Staying alive until they can get up on their own is often smarter.
---
True I'm kinda stupid. Probably because i was a Titan main from the start of Forsaken to the start of Shadowkeep.
---
WAIT YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT EQUIPPED??? 
---
I'm fucked...
---
Yeah. I decided to just opt out of this iron banner. Haven‚Äôt even talked to saladinner yet
---
I did vanguard for enhancement cores
---
I was a Warlock though but yeah. Either way I use a sweet business titan when my Sweet business titan buddy wants to do some gambit. He is the Yeeter (Missile) and I am the Mauler
---
Im not a fusion user but i think what the issue is elsewhere. I think that fusions and to a lesser degree shotuns are balanced around the idea of not being able to use them instantly. I think that if backup plan and quickdraw were removed from their respective archetypes that things would be a lot better. Sure they would have range, but youd have time to react.
---
Yeah that strike is the poster child for "better to stay alive yourself to avoid a wipe" rather than trying to stand still under the orbital bombardment while rezzing, anyway.
---
How you have so much stats???
---
Titans are op.
---
Buy bounties, buy planetary resources from spider
---
Not me. But you just have to have high level gear like some of the Season Pass gear. I think it‚Äôs gear t37 and onwards is rolled with a base of 60+.
---
The last stand of the hunter.
---
Didn't say to use it on your warlock and the fact I said Actium War Rig should imply Titan use...
---
Yup

Cool thanks for the info, I‚Äôll just keep grinding the levels then and hope for some decent blueberries. People just seem to set it off so they can spawn enemies for bounties at the moment, it‚Äôs annoying.
---
Step 1: MW your wardcliff at shuro chi      
---
Step 2:???
---
Step 3: Profit
---
Nice.
---
Yeah it's rough, I've been trying to get the Warlock armour set and I barely go past wave 3 because nobody sticks around
---
yeah its crazy, and it's just a sparrow :( oh well!
---
Its because PvP players largely view gambit as a joke. The Irony is that PvP right now is quite possibly the biggest joke due to it having so many issues.
---
Don‚Äôt tell me next season we have to use the sundial and get her... Season of Fenchurch (or how ever you spell it)
---
Before all that, during the events of Curse of Osiris- we already found his corpse AND his ripped out Light, after osiris already spent decades. 
---
The death of the undying mind fucked up the timelines enough that we could rewrite those moments. Either way Osiris looked for Saint like I look for my keys on a friday morning.
---
And somehow edge transit
---
You made a grave error in not including a clip in front of Saint 14
---
Truth have real tracking and "grenades and horseshoes" which make rockets blow when they close to somebody. It's perfect for not shooting to floor.
---
Yeah that is true
---
lol wut
---
Can I have cred?
---
Drops the n bomb and has 420 in username. Definitely a 12 year old white kid who gets touched by his dad...
---
Lol don't bother, this is the type of guy that steals kills from his team mates in survival and then spams last word.
---
I've been out sniped by Erentil. The things rage is stupid, there was a post showing this guy killing people with it at the furthest possible ends of gambit matches, a little over 70 meters. Range enough that if you don't have a high impact sniper a head shot is not a one hit kill, but 3 bolts of erentil is. Not even all 6. just 3. 
---
There is no possible way to dispute how broken Firmly planted and backup plan on basically ANY fusion is. It's also impossible to dispute that the range of erentil is just way too much. It should never out compete snipers at range. Nothing except a rocket or LFR should
---
So Sundial IS the same 4 tasks over and over and over again. I thought I was just getting super unlucky randoms, or was maybe playing the wrong game mode. Seems like a really disappointing addition with this season. Thank you vm for the rundown, I understand it a lot more now.
---
At least the trickster made drifter laugh
---
Your bond m8
---
Not to mention, his dodge was fully charged
---
Yeah, who would have thought that our secret titan tactic was "run into the enemy team and punch"...
---
Yep. Invaders with those guns easily out rank any other in my experience.
---
Hot maybe if you emoted after he wouldn't have diss you
---
Nope, hit scan. Its instant.
---
They‚Äôre right though
---
I mean, if you're a warlock, your mindset is "move, shoot, use an ability, move, shoot, etc.". The titan strat of "run and punch" may be too subtle for you.
---
Dude it one shots through over shields and can 1 tap a super if you have target, what are you on?
---
So lets get to taking out their moderators, one by one.
---
Me too, not to mention it has one of the longest charge times of any fusion rifle
---
Ooooo you used the n word ooooo so cool oooooooo oh my oooooo
---
I mean get 10 kills with rockets/ 15 rockets that "didn't count" you get the feeling of fuck this.
---
Ight I‚Äôm calling Saint
---
The true trickster since I still can‚Äôt get the triumph to unlock
---
You do realize that Bungie uses P2P instead of dedicated servers right?  Do you understand that with P2P if you are in the tower with someone 4000 miles from you and they are the host of the instance, you may have "connection" issues because of them being the host? Exactly what can OP do about the host player's internet causing him issue.
---
Of course dedicated servers would help, with everyone's issues in the game.  But even if Bungie would just institute a ping test before matching up players in any instance it would help.  If you have more than so many ms for the ping test you cannot join the instance and it will move on to then next instance until you can get in.  If it cannot find a good instance for you it should kick you out of matchmaking with a message about why they could not match you up.
---
I feel like he's going to want it the other way
---
This is the way.
---
Blink is getting out of hand
---
Toke'd up the Traveller
---
What?
---
F
---
You know waht is much more interesing than the bot bully thing? Your setup i mean a bow and skyburners oath and a sword? Dafuq
---
Pretty sure the quest is there so you can't turn in a bunch of tokens from the previous season's IB.
---
*Grabs pitchfork and torch*
---
Time for a fucking crusade
---
maybe i'm just hella lucky but i got Anarchy on my first run and i got 1k voices on my first run
---
You also get "pinnacle" mods if you haven't unlocked all of them yet.
---
Reported for breaking rule 3 of this subreddit.
---
The Titan bashing is getting old.
---
So it will show there from time to time?
---
What platform?
---
Flashpoint‚Äôs are a weekly event that happen on a certain planet or destination so you gotta wait for Tangled Shore to be chosen. There is supposedly a rotation for which destination is available
---
This exactly. I get the grind. But the grind should be, y'know, grindable. The format they use is just disrespectful of our time.
---
Excuses wont get you anywhere
---
Don‚Äôt like it? Bash the other classes. And where are the rules for the subreddit?
---
Shotgun/melee will never die in bungie games lol
---
***~~SEND HELP~~***
---
You could say the same thing about ‚Äú5 finisher kills‚Äù. Every kill is a finisher.
---
Yes, much more often than a flash point
---
&gt;Were you not loved in your childhood?
---
*"Show us on the Guardian where the bad man touched you..."*
---
:-/
---
If that was the case then why not erase your tokens at the end of the season instead.
---
Finding a good clan can really help out, not only with getting more fireteam members, but also with planning weekly raids.
---
Zavala: as a gaurdian, we welcome you into the city and we hope that-
---
*Looks over and sees me and Ikora beating the shit out of Uldren in the corner*
---
Get lucky
---
The main problem isn't fusions as a whole, it's the Erentil. For some reason, they thought it was a good idea to make a fusion with a possible near max range stat AND back up plan. This is coming from someone with 2k kills on an Erentil that used it quite a lot during the first 2 seasons of Y2.
---
I knew this gun would, at some point, be considered busted. Lo and behold, I was right. Please bungie. Us voop mains don't have many good fusions. Please make the Erentil balanced.
---
Yet I can put a charger on  mine mid game and be fine. U guys gotta spend money  for batteries and for me ( being a cheap sob) that‚Äôs not gonna happen chief
---
Saw another "mara sovs" name that was pretty funny but I forget what it was lol
---
It's Crucible, but with extra steps.
---
I had saved an exotic engram in the postmaster before shadowkeep dropped and when I opened it I got the gun.
---
I used to agree, but bungo's netcode and prefer-the-shooter mechanics make it impossible to dodge good aim even with high speed. I am now of the opinion that in pvp you mostly just want to kill before being killed
---
YOUR ENEMY CANT KILL IF THEIR DEAD HAHA
---
Thank you
---
I got it after completing a quest from Zavala.
---
You don't even know how to read my god. Me pointing out stats, hard numbers and statistics as well as posting links to other people pointing out stats and statics = QQ? 
---
QQ is what you're doing. Crying like a bitch to get something you don't like to stop. I never said they need to be destroyed, I said as it is with certain perks there is no denying its power. How is that QQ? Pointing out it can literally out snipe snipers with a scatter type weapon is crying? Crying would be "man I got hit by it and I can't do anything about it ever it needs to be deleted!"
---
No, I said it can hit cross map, and that its absurd. 
---
I commented on this thread where people were inaccurately depicting the archetype, and on a few others expanding on their own explanations. I haven't cried once, you're the only one who seems to think constructive criticism is crying. Providing statistics, with personally recorded data in an informative tone is tantamount to crying? So all scientists in peer review are crying? 
---
Like I said, take your tough guy wanna be shit elsewhere, no one thinks your cool or tough. My condolences for your lack of a spine in real life, causing you to supplicant it online.
---
It's a random RNG drop. I go time when Xur was selling it a while back.
---
Ehhh I suppose. I generally don't use them and play console, typically don't see them as often. For me it seems out or place for that type of weapon especially because linear fusions seem like they should hold the title for long range fusions. I think it would be cool to have some linear fusions in the energy slot and have those be long range and regular fusions be the shorter range options. 
---
Kind of like slug shotties vs regular ones. I do see your point though and I'm not one to just condemn a gun into the ground because of the mob lol. Appreciate the feedback üëçüèª
---
Thank you. This is now my favorite destiny ranked video.
---
What is ‚Äúthe veil‚Äù and where can I find the lore that introduces it?
---
someone explain to me how they were doing all that super energy please?
---
I prefer hand cannons too, I normally dismantle all my sidearms. I just want it for the collection badge.
---
Yeah I'm the scrub because you refuse to adapt your tactics to deal with someone using a fusion? Seriously? You can't see where that's the issue u can't help you.
---
I finished it but keep camping the heavy just for the lulz.
---
It's bittersweet to hear I'm not the only one getting unregistered rocket kills during this step. I swear multikills only count as one. I take no pleasure in your plight guardian, but at least I'm not going crazy... Alone...
---
You don‚Äôt have a quest called ‚Äúa giants might?‚Äù
---
I buy tributes for my hall. Got a ways to go.
---
Does the count reset it you switch to the other mode?
---
Yeah I'd like to know this too.
---
Mine was a random drop. Crucible I think.
---
NutRItIoUS*
---
You know, I really think you should just stop posting on destiny forums and just keep trying to find a fuck buddy.
---
Nope. I looked for a good 10 min. Especially hard to miss when the icon for the quest is j√∂tunn LUL
---
*sprints in circle to prepare for shoulder charge*
---
What are we looking at?
---
Happened to me last time lol
---
Jumping off is cheating
---
Sure.
---
For the uneducated ones - what are those chests? What were you trying to do?
---
i dismantle too many things and got Lord Of Wolwes from engram, it was worth it
---
Nah, I'll give it an 8
---
Why dont we compromise and call it a 7
---
Wow dude. Being a fucking idiot isn‚Äôt that important though...
---
Every kill finishes the enemy. Fact.
---
I‚Äôm so sad. Back in the summer I had a great Trickster meme and it got like 5k upvotes but it got taken down because I said ‚Äúfortnite gay‚Äù
---
Some skill because you know how to aim and land head shots and then some luck because the guy behind him just lined up for you
---
Luck, they lined up at the right time
---
I‚Äôve turned in over 100 cookies to Zavala just for the bounties. Don‚Äôt care about the reward. Eva can‚Äôt make me do anything
---
Your first point literally applies to everything in life, especially Reddit.
---
Registered Vex Offender
---
It is possible but yes you have to get each obalisk to rank 10 that's why It says 28 each one is a 4 step
---
TRAVELER TAKE THE WHEEL
---
The helmet was always on
---
I got mine. Plan to do a few rounds tonight as a bubble Titan for randos.
---
All of them? If you just want the base enemy experience or aren‚Äôt used to the game yet just strikes and patrols really. When your more used to controls try crucible, then when you understand mechanics and have weapons you like play some gambit
---
crucible, but most of the game is locked behind ps plus, hope you enjoy it!
---
There are several issues with how people run bounties and strikes  
---
1) Rushing past everything. As OP described, it's shitty. Enemies despawn, you lag behind because you are trying to kill them, etc. Deaths become incredibly punishing because nobody will res you. It's boring to spend 30 seconds once in a while just watching others run and jump... sometimes throw nades.  
---
2) ignoring objectives in favor of kills. I get that you have bounties to complete, but please do the goddamn objective. There is no need to drag out this Strike for longer than it needs to be. If there are several plates to capture: spread out and actually stand on them. The enemies will come, no need to sit in front of their spawns.  
---
And, to be frank, those issues aren't so bad. One makes the Strike only go quicker (i.e. you get new 'better' teammates that suit your playstyle better sooner) and you get a few more kills; the other makes it last 1-2 minutes longer. Oh no, this short activity takes a tad longer.  
---
The real issue is back fill. On it's own it's not terrible, but the sparse checkpoints mean you join waaaaaaaaaaay behind the rest of the team and spend all the time running, only to be dragged in during the boss fight. Free Essense, I guess, just feels shitty.
---
Go eat another crewmate, ya shitty space hobo.
---
Titans and their toys.
---
**MMMM YOU‚ÄôRE TENSE**
---
As long as you take out someone else with you
---
You just triggered my PTSD lmao
---
# *I HAVE THE POWER!!!!!*
---
bc i need shard, too much shard
---
I actually gave up on the iron banner quest because I suck and cant get the heavy to get my rocket launcher kills.
---
Think of it as constructive criticism
---
This is not the place to report bugs, just FYI. This subreddit has no affiliation with Bungie, and devs don't come here. r/destiny2 is made up of and ran by players like yourself.
---
Also, this has always been around and is more a feature than a bug ;)
---
This is probably one of the best "bugs" in the game.
---
These are just random drops on year 1 planets (EDZ, Titan, Nessus, Io, Mercury, Mars).
---
We used to just have to do simple quests to unlock each piece, and then farm tokens, but I guess that was bad from Bungie's point of view?
---
mobile users die
---
It's the same BS as novabombs
---
You can avoid running into this by checking your radar in the top left
---
There is also nothing more infuriating then having any of the many broken supers still kill after they have been hit by the tether directly or had their super taken only to still die to it. Yes the hunter is a high rick high reward but titans and warlock are just easy mode. First tile I played on my titan I piped hammers and wiped the entire team. Those supers are to easy to use and are to forgiving.
---
Close the game, fully restart your system, check again
---
This is a fix thats worked for me. I fast travel there once, if it doesnt work ill fast travel there again, somehow i spawn in with my heavy equipped instead of kinetic, switch back to my kinetic, then fast travel to the gulch. 
---
Works every single time I try.
---
Oh look another fallen enemy variant. Look it has four arms instead of six and looks like a dog, with a red legion symbol. 
---
Red legion fallen? Isn‚Äôt there already enough fallen?
---
This deserves more up votes
---
I‚Äôm not seeing any fallen just
---
T a cabal warbeast

Yeah ok dank memes you dying subreddit
---
Same has no issues and I suck at PvP
---
Ah, you must be new here.

\*screams in Shaxx\*

Interesting.  Thanks for the take...hadn‚Äôt thought of it that way.
---
The message is:  I was in awe of Destiny for a long time...now with the whole interstellar bake sale it‚Äôs turned into a F‚Äôing circus.
---
Just buy them from the spider in tangled shore, or do a few runs in nightfalls/crucible.
---
You should keep exotics armour you get because of the new elemental and stat system, you might have rolls that you want to use later on :)
---
I agree with you on the iron banner quest. 
---
I think I'm less concerned with the timesink for grinding though as that's what gives the game longevity for me. I suppose I was conditioned in D1 and now I just see everything as being better.
---
Titan sentinel needs buffed/reworked
---
Reeeeeeepost
---
Special weapons are the kind I listed before. They have either the ability to one shot, or kill at extended ranges compared to other weapons.
---
I edited it to clear out my point. Stop your victim complex please, it helps no one.
---
Wow much impress. /s
---
i dont have too much material :(
---
This is heresy. Someone call Shaxx and get him to call the red jacks on em. Everyone who plays crucible bring your cancerous loadouts and end r/dankmemes
---
Yes.

Oh yeah lol got the species wrong , can‚Äôt edit it right tho

I am pretty sure it has the second or third lowest zoom

Kudos to whoever designed that font. Seems like a pain in the ass to come up with it

He does... but the risk of exploding bricks is low but can be avoided. My propane forge is only in the 200 usd range. If you have any questions about blacksmithing or bladesmithing stuff my inbox is open. There are ways to make a coal forge lower tech

Ok good but the joke is Titans = brainless cause they spam w in pvp

No I‚Äôm weak, but I‚Äôm not stronger than the minimum

AND HIS NAME IS JHON CENA!

thanks man
---
Watch out for bots. Seems like someone already snatched it from the picture file.
---
The bug is: this quest should have been deleted.
---
Atm this bow and erianas are not obtainable
---
The Curse of Suffering is the encounter im paid attention to. Besides Opulent Mods, any other Mod suggestions when running the encounter?
---
?
---
I play comp solo about 3 or 4 matches each morning before I start my day. I get messages all the time from my team and the enemy team. What r u using bro wtf, or what is that load out dude, or this isn't a sniper map. Then at the end after I've carried them to victory I usually get a sorry man. It is what it is. If people can't appreciate non-meta loadouts, then fuck em. Simple as that
---
This was posted as a meme, not a bragging post in regards to loot or the roll. I didn‚Äôt ask a question on whether or not to keep it, nor did I ask ANY question about the armor piece.
---
Gambit prime would be faster. Only 1 round.
---
I have all of the exotics, meaning the engram will give me any exotic from the pool. I just happened to get the one that he has featured. Lol

Go for it. For asking I‚Äôll upvote your post

Ngl I've left raids I just joined just cuz my friend got online

What char are you playing?
---
I am also a Wayfarer. IDGAF I love my title.
---
Implying that bubble is problematic/toxic. Come on man its a wasted super lol. Nothing to get passionate about
---
These reasons are why most players dislike gambit. It's not that Gambit is bad, it's that your teammates actively playing for the other team is bad.

Nothing makes me happier than when Shaxx tells me I'm more dangerous than an extinction-level event in the crucible
---
also the Titan armor in the season pass has a high stat total, but it's not a great roll. all the pieces have way too much resilience

Ghat dang cheaters finding new ways to grief... These types of players need to GTFO of this game, it doesn't need anymore bad press as it is right now!

I'm not going solo. I can barely clear a vanguard strike solo. Just finished with a fireteam of professional badasses who already had the catalyst with probably a lot of progress on it. And no, I dont have Raiden flux or Liar's Handshake
---
Yep, and my stress levels have gone down considerably whenever I stop doing PvP. The problem is that they keep tying really good weapons to PvP.
---
This is quality didnt no it was possible to hit so many walls at such high speeds without dying lmao
---
Not necessarily, but resetting ranks have a very low chance to give you an exotic I think. Gambit prime and reckoning will give you better weapons. Also quests for various exotics can give you a legendary weapon that coincides with the exotic (ex: lumina quest gives you Rose)
---
Look at that boulder! That is a nice boulder!
---
The architects blessed me that day
---
Thank you!!

I stopped doing it because of all the camping. Whole teams of people not even playing the objective and just sitting on heavy made getting heavy difficult. When I finally did get heavy, I was killed almost immediately. Played about 50ish games, probably more since I was doing the Dawning Questline too.

Gave up and decided to save my tokens for next time.
