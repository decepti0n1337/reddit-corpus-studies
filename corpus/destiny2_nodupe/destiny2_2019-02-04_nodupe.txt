Catalyst is meh, you reload the shotgun faster than you can fire without it.

Hunters have the highest potential sprint speed in the game as is.
---
Trinity Ghoul :)
---
I hope the season 6 pinnacle weapon is a sidearm!
---
I wish their were different tiers for mobility that increases max sprint speed on top of the strafe speed bonuses. Right now running mobility feels kind of useless...
---
Does anyone else remember in D1 that you could see the roster as it filled up? Why did that go away? 
---
The Kill Clip one. If you get a kill and reload, by the next round you should have some bonus damage bullets.
---
Unless they already killed somebody, it does nothing but mark you so you would‚Äôve died in a scenario where they weren‚Äôt wearing it
---
YESS THE CHIKA DANCE!
---

---
I would happily replace every emote I had for this glorious dance. Only to be surpassed if they gave me a Jojo lean with MENACING showing up around me. 
---
Fortnite didn‚Äôt make these dances
---
You say that like it's bad thing. :) 
---
They can‚Äôt even group 4 stacks against each other or make teams based on skill so i wouldn‚Äôt hold your breath on this one 
---
Unless you feel like skipping curse of Osiris, Warmind, and the red war then use it. I personally regretted using it but that‚Äôs just me 
---
I recall getting an overshield when I used it in PvP before though 
---
isochonals only cover that first year exotics. if they're giving you repeats, you have all of the first year exotics available on that class.
---
not including rat king or the legend of arcturius
---
Is it me? I think it‚Äôs me. 
---
Stack Quickfang on top of that or MIDA
---
My last 4 have been dupes.  It‚Äôs really sad.
---
Good for you, champ.

To be fair, nobody uses top tree void titan.

Nah you're doing great precious

What are your issues with the game? 
---
You're not even near the end.

Noice
---
I remember when I was grinding for mine I got up to 1800ish then dropped down to 1200 and spent 3 weeks getting to 2100
---
Can u find something like this for hunter?
---
Doubt he‚Äôll go rouge it seems Bungie wants to tell a redemption story with him
---
\*Crimson w/Iridescent Death, Ace Of Spades w/Salute To The Colonel

When you thought your crush broke up with her bf but it was just a false alarm. RIP!

o damn

Sagira was just shutdown/too injured to operate,

Cayde's Ghost was literally shot and the 'eye' and exploded 
---
Keep playing Tier 3, overclock whenever possible. Might take a while but it'll happen. 
---
Lmao 
---
Thats what I thought too...until today !!
---
Wife: "What are you laughing at?"
---
My bad. I even read the post a few times before replying. I don‚Äôt know man, maybe another few tries at full power? There might be one thing but it‚Äôs fuzzy. I think if you‚Äôve already gotten the week‚Äôs tier 3 reward without being able to get the seed to begin with you won‚Äôt have a chance until next week. 
---
Was that all of them?
---
I think you can in Iron Banner too; judging by how some jackass started PMing me before the match started to talk shit at me because my light level was below 650 and how I was using Nezarec's Sin wrong because I didn't equip Telesto.
---
Anthem is probably gonna be like destiny 2‚Äôs launch, everyone that left destiny for anthem is gonna come crawling back after tree days 
---
You're free to play other games. It's healthy.
---
What you DON'T need to do is announce your departure. 
---
I was kinda expecting you would overshoot the platform and fall of the cliff for comedic effect.
---
ok den
---
No 
---
&gt;why is there not a group finder tool ingame?
---
But... there kinda is
---
As for the raids, nothing good happens to the quality when you start tuning it for sightseeing while trying to tune hardcore
---
That rock has really janky physics if you try to jump over or on top of it. Usually it just yeets you to the ground or sometimes off the cliff, but in this case it killed him. 
---
I mean, it's not that surprising considering how many other cases there are of the physics engine making you commit the not alive. Phalanx shield bashes are one of the first to come to mind.
---
Those ornaments didn't affect the size of the weapon, so i didn't feel the need to mention them.
---
Dude seriously. Playing gambit and seeing Titans beat you out the door like wtf
---
If you ever need to do public events, but don't have a specific location needed, go to titan.
---
It's not awful by any means, it's just outshined by other exotics, handcannons, and even legendaries for PvE content in many situations (in my opinion). 
---
Admittey thoight it was ok and not something I'd enjoy.
---
Then I discovered sparrows that can roll and the ability to do tricks as well as Tangled Shore and Blind Well.
---
Also Gambit.
---
Typically I don't lean toward shooters.  I blame Cod of Dooty for that (not a mistype intentional pun).  Very few actually grab my attention.  Mainly as I play solo.
---
This, Spacelords, Titanfall 2, Team Fortress 2 and Bioshock 1 are all exceptions.  At least for me.
---
Damn man that was amazing.
---
There are also certain subclass trees threat provide enhanced sprint speed.  I‚Äôm also not sure if stompees or frostees provide a great boost to sprint speed.
---
Its class based. AKA if you have all weapons + Y1 exotics for your class, you will get repeats. You need to be on that class to get that classes Y1 exotics from the Isochronal
---
Wait. I legitimately thought luna was an exotic. My need for this gun has increased tenfold 
---
Initially the quest frustrated me, but by the end of the kill step, I was honestly significantly better at PvP. It didn't even take \*thaaaat\* many games, but those games just taught me a lot about survival because my deaths had a straightforward, negative impact on me. I enjoy crucible much more now because of that quest, while it was definitely frustrating at times to get through as a mediocre pvp'er
---
The Carlton isn't a real routine.
---
He did not write the song it goes to.
---
The dance is 10 seconds long.
---
It is about as complex as flossy dance.
---
The ballet sawn lake however...
---
I was two manning it last night with someone who was very not good at the game. I don't honestly know what the fuck he was doing but I kept killing two of the wizards and then getting a mud hole stomped in my ass.
---
Then I said "fuck it" and dropped Whisper for Jotunn. Beat it that next try. Killed all four wizards in about 30 seconds. It's literally 2 shots each.
---
Top tree Gunslinger. Once the Anathema start spawning you can go nuts with your super and kill everything.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs only a small difference, and you need to pull out all the stops when it comes to sprint speed bonuses on exotics.
---
Welcome to the year 1999. I still can't believe that PVP is actually P2P instead of dedicated servers.
---
Agreed. 
---
And get Bungie in shit like Fornite is for stealing everything.
---
Good Job, Keep it up.
---
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  everyone have their different preferences. I use Suros Regime and Crimson alternatively.
---
D2 is definitely not pay to win but matchmaking is broken. Sweaty comp players still use botheration sg and a bunch of year 1 weapons still
---
Na brah Pyrrha the only one
---
That was all of them two or three times over
---
Pfft. Shin can bring it. I'll even give his gun back. Good luck with the recoil! 
---
I will delete this game if I get another duplicate I am so serious lol.
---
Traction is a garbage-tier perk. 
---
I finally got around to installing D2 from the Humble Monthly a while back. I'm trying to figure out what the difference is between each of the versions so I can buy the DLCs for it. There's :
---
Standard
---
Forsaken + Annual Pass
---
Digital Deluxe
---
Legendary Collection
---
Complete Collection
---
[Link to first 3](https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/destiny2-forsaken)
---
[Link to last 2](https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/destiny2-forsaken-legendary-collection)
---
I've already got the base game I think from the Humble Monthly, so what is the difference between these 5 and which do I get to have all dlcs?
---
Nani!
---
Congrats, Guardian. Now say good bye to every other exotic. The Ace has become my crutch, I genuinely can't find enjoyment from any other weapon now. It's an absolute monster and so damn reliable. 
---
This game is a joke, I got 100k threshold and didnt get the emblem
---
Which is why I‚Äôm doubting destiny will be able to function fully as cross console. It‚Äôs either going to lose a deal with PlayStation or not go cross console and which in my opinion the better option would be to drop Cc because you wouldn‚Äôt be losing money nearly as much since PlayStation is constant paying for the exclusive content. This is kind of the same problem warframe has and is why I‚Äôm worried about it‚Äôs hope for cross console, since it updates a month prior on pc that‚Äôs more or less pc exclusive, though the money wouldnt be the issue as much as the time between updates. Anyway yeah that‚Äôs why I dont know what they‚Äôre going to do about exclusives or Cc in destiny... an unfortunately long comment basically saying if they do they fucked if they don‚Äôt they fucked...
---
There are currently three: the Thunderlord is an exotic previously acquired via a quest but now a random exotic engram drop; the Hammerhead can be acquired via the Volundr forge; the Avalanche was a random drop from completing Dawning missions.
---
Yeah, you are psychotic.
---
Maybe both teams get to pick a piece of armor and weapon or only get to choose one thing, like you can pick the stuff to ban before seeing the other teams set ups, this would make the game require more diverse teams and loadouts so you wouldn't see soo many one eyed mask titans with dust rocks. Like dont get me wrong seeing a one eyed mask here and there isnt bad but full teams are made up of these and it just kinda runs it for me.
---
I tried a high morality build, but it didn't turn out.
---
Looking great 
---
Super original
---
Yeah the counter to OEM goes against how you play the game lol. You'd have to identify that it's the OEM before doing anything (wastes time) and then only shoot if kill is guaranteed (probably not because you wasted enough time to give them first shit.)
---
The exotic is so counter-intuitive that it just doesnt make sense to exist as it is. Titan's have other ways to get OS. They could just let the exotic give the tracker and that's it. Put markers on everything that touches you for X amount of time. 
---
Dodging with frostees on increases sprint speed.  I just looked it up.
---
Hunters are supposed to be the fast. Super mobile characters. But they are wayyyyy slower than titans. Titans are stronger and faster on pc.   Consoles not so much.  But I‚Äôm PC they move at twice the speed of hunters.  It‚Äôs BS
---
I was thinking, wow this is taking a long time, hurry up and get to this ‚Äúbest shot ever‚Äù then I said ‚Äúohhhh, oh, shit.‚Äù
---
On the desktop site, you can put the tag in 
---
April fools?
---
Very very likely but I doubt he is gonna get shit so honor and more recognition is second best. At least it is better then some shitty facebook likes or something
---
The last entry where he literally writes that the Queen and Ace aren't real.
---
Don't know if you're still looking for them, but Xur is selling them until tomorrow. He's in the EDZ.
---
I don‚Äôt mind it but they‚Äôre plenty of people that are bad at it.  Plenty of King‚Äôs Fall runs ruined by people not able to handle platforming.
---
Forget hawk moon.
---
Forget the last word.
---
Forget thorn.
---
Give me my curse back
---
^or ^dark ^drinker
---
How many MUT coins we talking here?
---
You could say it‚Äôs drifting
---
I will take my leave now 
---
You have to get 10 engrams in order to buy the armor. 
---
Personally tbh only after getting geomags and having people ask I use that instead did I stop using dawnblade which I think I might just switch back to instead as I don't care for the other supers aside from dawnblade on warlock
---
That is correct. Bear in mind, the Annual Pass is all end game content. You won't be strong enough for it until at least a few weeks after finishing Forsaken. 
---
Does the DLC ever go on sale for really cheap? I just got to level 20 and finished the main story and had an absolute blast. I just can't afford to spend like $50 right now. I know its on sale but does it ever go lower than that?
---
Wait can you get sins of the past random rolled now
---
Well I'm not gonna compliment your ass, but dope tattoo Haha 
---
I dunno, maybe just me and my old d1 ways... still haven‚Äôt fully adapted I swear. But I still like it ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
The best part or the last word being introduced was the couple of days where no one used a shotgun, just tlw and sniper. Felt like d1 again
---
More like Lights in a Radiance.
---
That's a trade I'm perfectly ok with
---
Absolutely! I noticed this when watching vids on the update where the SoG in pve are supposed to regen super on impact but now that they did this tweak SoG hardly ever gives your super back unless ALL of your knives go into a boss rather then it's previous ad clear potential which was kinda just a different version of Orpheus rig which was nice this tweak was definitely needed for PvP but even after the rework Blade barrage is still the same menace for PvP offering almost the same super regen while in PvE it's better to be over looked
---
But during all this hunters got a buff to bottom tree gun slinger and titans got a buff to bottom tree striker I'm a hunter main and I still think warlocks need some love after the nova warp nerf
---
Tldr: BB in PvP is the same while SoG for PvE feels like a waste of exotic slot
---
That‚Äôs real fam. That‚Äôs real. 
---
Preciate it! 
---
Lmao your trying to compare bb to a melee and gun combo, your mother must have dropped you 
---
What dupes have you gotten? I got a duplicate Tricksleeves after decrypting a Tricksleeves from the first exotic.
---
&gt; As a more recent example, while everyone was on Titan waiting for the Witches Ritual event for the TLW quest step, a lot of them were just melting the Fallen Walker for the Weapons Exchange event since it was just delaying the next Ritual. But, of course, some people were upset about that, presumably because they had either finished their TLW quest or weren't even up to that step yet.
---
That won't make it happen faster though, the PE's are set on a timer, finishing one faster doesn't make a new one appear faster.
---
The point is if you are doing a PE it's most likely that you need it either for add killing or heroic so why be selfish and make it end quicker when it doesn't hurt you to allow it to go heroic.
---
That is smoothest 2d animation i ever saw.
---
I'd say blade barrage first, then either arc or void based on preference. The arc one adds a spinning deflection ability to arc staff where the void one let's you run around with knives. If you use the arc tree already then I'd say that one, if not then probably try out the void one 
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter you‚Äôll get all 3 eventually. They all work fine for leveling. 
---
Ah okay
---
When the boss electrifies the ground there will be tow vents that will be smoking.  Destroying them will give you a ball you can pick up and throw at the boss.  Throwing 3 of them at him will freeze him and start the heroic.
---
Stompeez and black talon over and over it seems.
---
Garbage mate. See there any other cool emblems like that? D2 embs suck ass 
---
Nice one, thanks for sharing!
---
that's kind of my thinking. limited dev time and resources, pressure to make money
---
I have wanted Wheatly as the voice of my ghost since Destiny 1. I have wanted it so bad.
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **1st Cakeday** morrmon! ^(hug)
---
I feel so dumb i deleted my avalanche and now im stuck with thunderlord if i wanna run a machine gun
---
Alright, I am on PC

You may have better luck on r/DestinySherpa/

I would be down but i'm on Xbox :/

Oof. I was gunna say, I‚Äôm on Xbox with all 650‚Äôs and I could help ya out. I‚Äôm still leveling on PC myself. 
---
Sexy
---
Ok ill be loggin after 3 hours lets play together. Which server you play on
---
Thanks for the info 
---
use r/DestinySherpa to find people that can teach the raid encounters. 
---
not many PC posts on there though, so here‚Äôs Alpha‚Äôs discord. Great sherpa,

---
But don't blame the ignorant and the lazy for bad game design. Some heroic public events like the cryo-pot depend on every random attending the event to google how to trigger the heroic event. This is far from user friendly design. 
---
The best way to fix these frustrations is to make it so that you can make these events heroic before some random gets to finish the event. Events like the witches ritual and the cabal excavation are much better designed that way. 
---
It's all good man.  I am at work at the moment.  Yay night shift lol.  I appreciate it though man.
---
I'm hearing people being really keen on surrounded instead of trench. Still have yet to get this weapon to drop at all but definitely looks worth it. 
---
exactly, like MONEY talks, this is shown by the fact activision though "destiny 2 didn't make enough money"
---
When i see my pvp kill count, i have 3k titan + hunter and 1k warlock so three more time people complaining nova warp was more broken than anything else.
---
Make sense if bungie only listened to complain instead of trying for themselves.
---
I can take they nerfed nova... but allowing this instead. + void hunter with better resistance than a titan and invisibility and speed and wallhack is a middle finger in the face
---
The 12th
---
Not really, tbh. The easiest way to dodge is to slide towards your opponent because that hitbox change is drastic enough to throw people off in the middle of a fight. Using the Hunter dodge just doesn't do what you claim. It's useful for the synergy with other abilities and it's useful in PvE, but in the Crucible it just doesn't do enough.
---
Alright cool thanks
---
Np
---
Oh I'm not shaming, just sharing. Thought people would be curious.  Also thought maybe if a celebrity doesn't take it so serious it would help with all the toxicity. 
---
Probably not I guess.
---
If you like destiny its more of the same. I play most days for the PvP! 
---
Yes....I don't see them often in PVE and PVP
---
I know how powerful OEM is in crucible but right now its very middle power in PvE. About on par with Wormhusk. 
---
  
---
As titans only sustain exotic I am very worried about the coming nerfs putting the titan sustain in the trash. Especially compared to warlocks sustain game which is miles ahead of titans and hunters
---
Tbh I wish they'd have cool strikes like this again. This one was fun along with the Darkblade. That was my favorite. I have the ascendant plane to cover that for me though. 
---
U mean going from TF2 to any game UwU
---
Those bitches who said D2 pay to win probably didn‚Äôt face any One Eyed Mask Titan carrying a Dust rock blues in comp 
---
looks fun
---
Congrats mate! My favorite gun in the game!
---
I raise an eyebrow as curiosity and intrigue strikes me
---
I feel you, I really don't know what to say but hopefully you find another super you like
---
Joking of course 
---
r/theflashtv is leaking
---
Maybe I should spend some time on my other characters for once, my hunter is level 12
---
*inhales* BOI 
---
This got me. 
---
; )

Clean af
---
Talk about the stars alining
---
Doesn‚Äôt every sniper have penetration ?
---
your comment could be 20 seconds shorter!
---
I've always loved platforming and jump puzzles. There are some in GW2 but the ol' kz maps in counter strike are where the real challenges are.
---
True if going uphill a little bit. But on a flat surface, in my experience/testing, sparrows are faster.
---
This should be from Estonia. 
---
rapid hit rampage is fkin great i'd say better than outlaw rampage on that HC
---
How do you keep getting super back every time you get a kill? It doesn't do that for me.
---
In D1 you could also choose your game mode, why did that go away? I don't want to set charges ....
---
Running sherpas on PS4 tomorrow if anyone‚Äôs I need send me a message or comment your PSN 
---
I‚Äôll be running it almost all day tomorrow if your on shoot me a message. 
---
PSN Oceanuus
---
No i was stuck on one till it expired, for two weeks i had it didnt get another till yesterday which got me my obcidan shard three days after the other went 
---
Is that the bubble one? I have yet to play crucible as a new player. When should I jump in?
---
So use Slowva bomb...that shit wrecks now with Skull of Ahamkara
---
Ah, I've had the dire ahamkara for a while now but never tried it, is slow the bottom or top tree?
---
The question is now, how do you get the engram
---
Prospector obviously 
---
Basically just get to level 30 (which you should be around after osiris and warmind, or higher), start forsaken, play it through and you should be around 500 light level, then just start to do everything that has "powerful gear" drops.
---
got my wishender yesterday
---
u/sick666mick 
---
sue dis boi 4 thefting
---
Psssh, amateurs,  I only cancel when its 7/8
---
I, for one, will be ok with that!
---
Do i need to finish the story to get the daily/weekly milestones? If i pull up the tab now to look at milestones it just wants me to do forsaken. I thought they were removed since it isnt on my tab
---
You lucky fuck
---
I was wondering because there is no 'powerful gear' drops. I guess i have to finish forsaken before i can do any of them?
---
It‚Äôs izanagi‚Äôs burden. It consumes a full mag for one powerful shot. That‚Äôs how he body shot the three guardians.
---
2 out of 4 comp matches i played yesterday started 3v4 because someone did exactly that. both games were winnable (players don't become gods when they form a four stack), but of course someone had to go "oh no, a four stack, better give up and hide". That tilted me more than the loss itself.
---
i like the bumblebee shader that the front warlock has, its like seeing my own warlock :P
---
I‚Äôm still waiting for the /s

/r/thathappend

not all just a few.... i would suggest atleast to 3x

it's not a god roll but it's decent.
---
Rat pack 
---
Militia's Birthright and Hunter Dodge.

So it's bungie's fault you suck

there should be something like r/unexpecteddrifter

if thats not already a thing
---
can confirm have a femdom thing and im into mara sov.
---
Dude will you stop spamming, you're far from the only person to have a curated threat level. 
---
I was stuck on Heroic III for ages. After winning one match my teammates invited me into their fireteam and we continued to play for quite some time.
---
My guess is that you can always ask other players while in competetive if they want to join your fireteam; you'd be surpirsed as to how many people are in the same situation.
---
Yeah, I know what you're saying! I really like the gun! :)
---
He doesn't drop duplicates unless you have all the armor pieces on that character.
---
Thank you! :)
---
I'm pretty sure I'm missing one more exotic and have been getting nothing but dupes 
---
One would think, but in early testing, it was going that Izanagi could not collat, even where a legendary could. It would take me some time to find the video but I suspect it was True Vanguard.
---
Either way, based on that video I always assumed Izanagi couldn't over penetrate, so this clip was a surprising myth buster
---
No way!! That's Amazing 
---
It took us just under 2 hours to do
---
I‚Äôll send the random party invite, I‚Äôll find my fireteam someday. 
---
What about prestige tho bro?
---
May be they are, if you have anyone to run them with...
---
How u kept getting it back?
---
Nothern europe, no problems in the past week
---
It‚Äôs the Wing Contender helmet, part of the Crucible armour sets. Each class has their own set which look similar, but have differing names (titan set is called Wing Discipline.) 
---
Yeah it was a bit of an ammo/orb fest!
---
"SPACING"
---
Whatever. I pre-ordered D2 and i was disappointed. I already spent $100 on the base game and the forst 2 expansions and they were whack. if the guy doesn't like my decision he has every right to but i jave every right to not give them my money because they dont deserve it from my point of view.
---
I lol‚Äôd cause I mean they were asking for it üòÇ
---
I have had that same problem at 650 but i was jus NAT issues
---
Agreed. Resilience should do a lot more across all classes. But also perhaps give Titans some base Resilience? Hunters should have some base Mobility and Warlocks Recovery. This myth keeps going around that Hunters have 4/1/0, Titans have 0/5/0 and Warlocks have 0/1/4 at base which of course is a lie, but maybe it shouldn't be. I don't know about those exact numbers but maybe each class could have 2-3 of their themed stat built into them from the start, which you can then add on.
---
Are you playing with friends? Is any of you is getting code errors such as weasel/ baboon/ beaver (most of solutions are: restart the game/ router or connect by ethernet cable instead of wifi).
---
Are you seeing communications such as connecting to d2 servers (often when matchmaking or just loosing connection to d2 servers in general)?
---
F
---
What am I watching, looks like you won
---
I think destiny is doing a fine job killing itself, and anyone saying that a 3rd person action RPG shooter with no PvP elements would kill a FPS PvP game, just isn‚Äôt paying attention.
---
And I‚Äôm mostly fucking with you, I think bungie has put themselves in a hard place trying to balance PvE and PvP with them leaving Activision I really hope for the best....but we will see in D3
---
Annual pass adds a new raid lair for 1. It allows you to get more achievements, with 2 upcoming releases: Jokers wild and the unannounced. The season of the forge allows you to craft weapons aka: grind for end game gear in order to get god rolls or just something to do. Story isn't half bad either, ads a lot of lore as well.
---
Orgasmic 
---
THAT WAS ALL OF THEM!
---
pyrrha BEST GIRL!
---
I actually think the game is really fun, just wanted to make a joke
---
My first though too! How, I mean how will it be possible?! üòÄ
---
I know it's a world drop, but do you remember what you were doing when OEM dropped for you?  
---
Alright
---
Everyone is complaining that this is as bad as Spectral and Nova Warp. That isn‚Äôt true at all, this guardian had a *skill-based* way to extend their super, where as Gwinsin and Nova just lasted that long for no reason. 
---
The annual pass isn't worth buying before you are atleast 620 light. I wasnt able to do any forges before I hit 620 light. 
---
On the other side... The last word missions are capped at 500 light. That handcannon is extremely nice in pvp, if you like to do pvp. 
---
Is the annual pass worth it.. Yes and no. It's like a dlc stayed out to last 10months. I don't like it that much.. but its okey.. 
---
Which platform are you playing on my Dude?
---
Meanwhile, I can‚Äôt get into the underbelly cuz I‚Äôm solo and don‚Äôt have friends 
---
YOU DON'T SAY SHERLOCK
---
Whether we wanted it or not
---
 I‚Äôm a hunter and I personally think that warlocks have been smashed hard and idk why but I never found a huge issue with the nova warp, and I hope warlocks find their new super for crucible because it will change it up a little and make it fun to see new warlock supers but that just my opinion.
---
r/comedycemetary 
---
YOOOOOOO THEY MADDD
---
Yea got it from resetting my rank in gambit. I've gotten shards of galanor from that as well as geomags by resetting my rank gambit. For some reason gambit has been so kind to me. 
---
Using a PS4 and can‚Äôt even upload a clip on to reddit 
---
Also r/foundthemobileuser
---
Damn bruh you‚Äôre a gambit professional

Then it wouldnt show in the "recently auqired"-tab, so nope, found or earned them all

Just like the division did lol

BRO! HOLY SHIT! ‚ÄúNow do it again guardian‚Äù 
---
In the beginning you could damn near snipe with the sum bitch.
---
Same on pc (EU) 
---
Im extremely bad at crucible so its very tedious for me idk if ill ever get it :/ 
---
Careful with that
---
Awesome, so destiny really wants to become anthem? 
---
gg
---
Haha, redownloaded it after many months of hiatus and was sure my firewall is blocking me.
---
Turns out, it's servers &lt;3
---
Until next season, when something you want even more comes out, and the season after that, and the season after that... üò≠
---
Hahaha
---
Thats a shame
---
HIVE! BRING A SWORD!
---
Damn thats some unfortunate timing haha
---
You don't need the annual pass there. The thing you are referring to seems to be the talisman, which will get you to the Dreaming City. Keep repairing the talisman, your adventure isn't over yet guardian! :)
---
Actually just got back on after about ten attempts... 
---
I‚Äôll give it a go
---
1. Whisper Of The Worm
---
2. One Thousand Voices
---
3. Sleeper Simulant
---
4. Thunderlord
---
The exotic collections page just shows the exotics I already own, right? Or does it serve another purpose? I knew I didn‚Äôt have the Stomp-EE5. But if I would have bought them from Xur for 27 shards, and then purchased the exotic Engram, I would‚Äôve likely gotten some other random exotic, right? 
---
It‚Äôs a glitch going through with the new patch. Same thing happened with my sniper frame I got from unlocking the gofannon forge. The glitch also doesn‚Äôt let you collect materials for the first step of a frame. It‚Äôs annoying 
---
Gl√ºckwunsch 
---
Ya'll paid $200 or more to play destiny 1 remake lol
---
I like how around 9 seconds your Titan throws a helpless, futile punch at the air, like "this is what I *would've done* if the Architects didn't *hate fun*" lol
---
I‚Äôm playing right now (ps4)
---
Why you reposting buddy?
---
Can you imagine completing an activity, see an exotic engram only for it to be an Emote.
---
Wouldn't that apply to your post? Game's not out yet, maybe it does end up killing Destiny. You dont know. Maybe wait until you get to actually TRY the game before you start proclaiming its *not* the downfall, et cetra, et cetra.
---
The only problem I have with hunters is Blade Barrage, their armor is a little bit too much.
---
Same I‚Äôm praying it‚Äôs this week because it‚Äôs killing me knowing I need only one weapon
---
I hope they reimburse us with the frames back, I really wanted a new sniper 
---
Well I want to eventually get it to stay up to date with content I was just wondering if I need it as soon as I finish forsaken 
---
The objective and titan skate
---
I may be a filthy macro loser, but I‚Äôm a filthy macro loser of class.
---
how do you cancel supers, or does it only work for certain ones?
---
Yikes 
---
As long as you have Forsaken, you'll be able to reach Max light until year 3. 
---
Been wondering the same thing myself, but for a different reason. I finished multiple heroic public events and lost sectors on Nessus using only Drang, and still have 0% Powerful Fallen Kills ü§î
---
Chattering Bone. High-impact reserves, Rangefinder.
---
Breath of the Dragon. Threat Detector, Snapshot.
---
Ursa Furiosa.
---
Sentinel, Code of the Commander.
---
I refuse to be crucible AIDS.
---
No shotgun, no OEM, no Striker. ‡≤†_‡≤†
---
I recommend getting it as well, but no you'll still have most of the dreaming city stuff to do and whatnot before you'll be able to start the black armory content.
---
‚ÄúThis shit‚Äù is a result of shit spawns. Nova Warp can do the same thing even with proper spawns
---
Nice. Leviathan gets shit but personally, I love it. Good get with the Inaugural Address, it's still my favorite Pulse Rifle in the game. Absolutely *slays* in all activities, but my favorite is using it in PvP.
---
If you didn't get Midnight Coup from this run, it's *definitely* worth trying for again. Recommend just playing some week when Benedict is selling it so you can just buy it with Tokens.
---
Danke
---
I still can‚Äôt connect 
---
Seems so for me. Kept getting "baboon" error (ps4) 
---
Yep that‚Äôs what i got
---
But how can he be lvl 40 in 2014?
---
it gave you a bump in health and started regen on dodge it was pretty good for hunter exotics so it was the only thing people used bc most of the hunter exotics where pretty bad compared to the titan ones but they keep complaining about it and panic ulting us till it got nerfed.
---
how do people capture things like this.  are people really just playing games while constantly recording in case something epic happens?  this has been a long time question for me.
---
For the blight heroic event, I normally clear the first wave without shooting the main/heroic blight because the ones in the following waves have MUCH less health
---
I figured as much since it really is such a great moment! Just remember to do it in the future and it will become muscle memory. It will be especially deadly with your geomags too.
---
I once had my clanmates all start getting online before the agreed raid start time, and we launched with a full fireteam AT the agreed start time. No earlier no later. It was a thing of beauty.
---
Once...
---
After just doing it for the first time yesterday with two experienced 650s, yes. I agree wholeheartedly. 
---
It was harder than I thought it would be.
---
my dick can  only get so hard here.
---
Ok, I‚Äôll take the bait. Destiny is a game that just needs more fuckin end game content. Bungie has something significant on their hands and now that they‚Äôre separated from Activistion, they have free reign on how the outcome of the rest of Destiny 2 will be.
---
The third installment has to bring something different to the table. I‚Äôm really not trying to buy another carbon copy of the first game again. As for anthem, it‚Äôs ok... I didn‚Äôt enjoy playing it but that might‚Äôve just been the terrible demo and I could just be a little whiny bitch. I‚Äôll definitely wait for  reviews after it drops. 
---
No... they need to make it take less time to 'capture' the boss. The general consensus is "30 sec for normal or 5+min for heroic with almost the same loot"
---
ALRIGHTALRIGHTALRIGHT!
---
I got D1 and the DLCs with no knowledge of what to expect right after my junior year of high school. Ended up playing every single day all summer.
---
Definitely not.
---
There's way too much cheese you can pull off to be worth a complete title.
---
I‚Äôve made zero progress on getting g the ship or ghost the past few months even tho o do them every chance I get
---
People not in your group show up as little blue dots on your map
---
I get the whole wanting a weapon for collections thing, and I get that people despise crucible, but I personally can not stand gambit. I believe the reward to length of game ratio is atrocious, and I think it‚Äôs by far ridiculous I have to play it to receive the breakneck. But I still grind from time to time, and it‚Äôs doable. It may take you a while but don‚Äôt give up on something, especially weapon, just because of crucible. 
---
Its crazy. Its especially noticeable on maps like Burnout that are waaaaay too small for 6v6. With little coordination, you can essentially force your enemies to spawn where you eant them and do circuits around the map just murdering them. Just because its way too damn small and the spawns are all predictable and manipulatable.
---
I do agree that any requirement for these meta-triumphs that relies on pure RNG drops to move forward is really silly. They should be based solely on activities that you can complete. 
---
I played the first month of D2 release and public events were super fun and rewarding. Now it's 1 blue, 2 planetary mats EVERY TIME
---
Given that people had issues with quests not updating, getting kicked from the server and such for at the very least 2 hours now.. we do care.
---
Because it basically means you can't start anything right now, without risking to get reset back completely. We did keep the loot for example, but everything else got completely set back to 0, including progress in a solo shattered throne run..
---
CABAL ON THE FIELD.
---
If you read the fine print... didn‚Äôt yo mama teach you betta?
---
When you cast a WoR (at least in Crucible), there‚Äôs an orb which appears above the sword you cast. It can take damage and be destroyed, effectively killing your WoR. 
---
i was excited to play the demo. i drove 45 minutes to a starbucks to download the vip in time.  i got it downloaded on laptop on sunday then got home around 7  i loaded the files on my pc and launched up anthem anxiously awaiting the chance to try the game i had been waiting to try.  i launch it up.  servers had been turned off.  the demo had ended.  I wasted over 8 hours downloading 43 gigs at a starbucks and didn't even get to try the demo.  why me...
---
I'd imagine 100% of the people saying that didnt actually play the demo. As far as I can tell the only end game will be three of those strongholds.  That's it. Yikes.
---
Dawnblade is still very good just requires high skill to use. Nova Warp was a little too easy to use, but still didn't deserve what happened to it.
---
Also, they aren't going to balance the game around skating. It is an exploit that they will eventually do away with, especially considering it's only possible with high framerates.
---
Man walked into a alien club and killed everyone, racism!
---
Yeah I'll be staying put for at least a year.
---
It has promise but it just doesn't feel like a year one purchase
---
His helmet didn't stay on
---
The idea of "one game killing another" is a mentality that is way too common in the industry especially in the shooting genre. It always bothered me when people did this with COD and Battlefield and I love both franchises.
---
I rarely run CR because of the lack of vision when cast, but I am getting into the habit of cancelling when I know it‚Äôs no longer useful. The issue with the above clip is I still wasn‚Äôt sure if they were all dead !!
---
Hate to bum you out friend but me nor my buddy have the link anymore. But if you really want em do a simple google search. 100% sure youll find em!
---
I still don't have it fuck me
---
Rip finally got Cerberus +1 last night from the heroic mission in the EDZ. Rnjesus can be a bitch
---
I did.
---
Sure, RNG timegates are dumb; i agree. But being able to skip them with a cheese run of a dungeon where methods exist where the bosses literally don't even shoot back anymore, would make the title absolutely worthless still.
---
Nice! I‚Äôm in the same boat, I really love the neutral game of CR but the super fucking ~sucks~ is difficult to use, but it‚Äôs not too bad if you use it for 1-2 people and immediately cancel it.
---
It's from the Nascent Dawn quest in Warmind. It's the scout rifle you get before the Polaris Lance. 
---
as titan main i agree. 
---
Had the exact same feeling last night having my girlfriend watch me go 38 kills to 6 deaths on mayhem as a BB hunter with Galanors on and finishing the "defeat guardians" step of the Last Word quest!
---
Why waste time say lot word, when few word do trick?
---
I don't know, I think it has its niche but at present it is too effective, a change is deffo necessary but i wouldn't delete it from the game
---
Has anyone tested to see if it drops if you re-forge the same powerful weapon more than once in a week?  I'm trying for blast furnace rolls atm, and also need Jotunn - only the first pulse-rifle frame of the week costs a Ballistics Log to start, but after that it only costs Modulus Reports from Ada.  So I could just re-forge the pulse-rifle frame over-and-over, and not be stuck with the 6-per week limitation (if this works).
---
I know I know, my emotional self-flagellation should be evident by my comment.
---
This is satisfying to watch. That carnage ...
---
No, he leaves on Tuesday. 12pm eastern 
---
Ok now i am tilted. Me too want that fucking shell
---
Yes, I actually got a second Jotunn doing thst same thing. The first two weapons forged are considered powerful, giving you a shot at it
---
You just have to play safe.  Deposit when you get them, don‚Äôt get greedy and try to deposit 10 or 15 motes.
---
Pewpewpewpew
---
They definitely won't go away
---
Titanius Marshmellowist
---
Hunter BB and Titan can be shot down like that too, so what the difference ? the new update Blade Barrage only deal 50dmg on impact and if the Hunter die before it explode, you only take 50dmg.
---
I don't see why the forges would disappear; 1) if Bungie keeps them around, they can continue to charge money for the season pass, and 2) the whole forging gameplay loop is a good way to raise light level/control what weapons you get. 
---
(plus it would just be weird to axe that whole side story just because a new season is out)
---
I'm hoping that if they continue to put out new content after this year, they'll add in more content for the forges (new weapons at least).
---
Every event has a way to be turned heroic. For example the Taken Blight event there is the big Immune taken ball, you dip yourself for a second in one of the take blights and then you can damage the ball for a while, with enough damage done to the ball the event turns Heroic, boss comes out and you kill him.   
---
If you're wondering how to figure this out then the easiest way is to look it up on internet. The game itself sometimes gives hints, like the Cabal miner - you can damage the vents in the Evacuate phase.
---
The reason you want to turn events heroic most of the time is Quest progression. If any quest tells you to do Public Events then finishing them on heroic can give you double the quest progress.  
---
ü§£ü§£ that was f**kin‚Äô fantastic!! ü§£ü§£
---
I am ignorant to your cheese method. I did it legit. Please enlighten me (example: YouTube video)
---
Ok good I had same issue last night 
---
Destiny 2 is a looter game and grind is its content. At least that's how I understand it.  
---
What would "content" be in your understanding?
---
God roll and sword only go together in the following way:
---
There is no god roll for any sword.
---
Because swords are useless.
---
Dismantle.
---
What cheese can you do on a solo run. As far as I'm aware there isn't one that can be done solo and the one that could be done as group was fixed months ago.
---
If there is a solo cheese please just explain what it does and not how to achieve it. 
---
Not trying to call you out but is the watermark another account of yours or something
---
Do you like the Spinning up or Dual Speed?
---
r/SubsYouThoughtYouFellFor
---
I‚Äôd be on board with being guaranteed the ship but not the title
---
Just bag them
---
Star Wars dlc5?
---
I don‚Äôt have a problem with that. I just think we‚Äôve got too many exotic hand cannons as is tho. Some more exotic weapon diversity would be good.
---
The grip looks a bit too short
---
The Last Word
---
Good work man! 
---
I'm still stuck at 63% of the first step...
---
I used to love this thing. I remember it being my very first exotic when I got it from Xur. As much as I would love to see it return, I fear it would get no use due to its lackluster perks. That's still a hecking cool drawing tho.
---
I'm proud of you too , I played Tuesday and Wednesday and I left the second part of the quest at 56 % then I played Sunday and it went all the ways to the other side I'm a 7% now :'(
---
AMAZING WORK
---
TLW looks really fun on PC... wish It didn't jump like it does on console.
---
Nobody ever shoots my shield anymore :(
---
Which two?
---
I only found out yesterday myself :)
---
Bungie already killed destiny so...
---
It's like full circle lol
---
Wishender and izanagis burden
---
I‚Äôm all for grinding. But jeez man when my grind results in my 600th smugglers word, or my raid loot results in 3 chest armors in a row with a final shitty rocket for the 4th time it gets frustrating. I‚Äôm all for looting a shooting, but make my rewards and my time worth it. I spent so much time getting the flawless floating set for my hunter only to be met with it being useless in year 2. Grinding is great don‚Äôt get me wrong, but to sit here and pretend that destiny 2 is a real looter shooter is kind of a joke 
---
omg confirmed 
---
Hand cannons will always have the last word
---
Pro tip: Kill them instead of running away then getting marked won‚Äôt matter 
---
Can I get my money back?
---
There's multiple cheeses which are still possible.
---
* One method allows you to skip the complete first "boss" in "the descent", the whole sniper room, the area where you get slowed down and the pgre room before it. You basically only clear a few mobs after doing the very first encounter (the symbols) and can skip right to the open area after the room that normally slows you down.
---
* There's still a working method/spot to be entirely save from the witches (for some reason not the vandals..) and the ogre itself in the ogre boss room, which allows for pretty easy cleaning of the ads, shooting the witches down to a single bar of HP and allowing people to just go around, grab the orbs and go into damage phase without the risk of dieing. This one doesn't work on warlock tho afaik.
---
* The method/spot that makes the heavys in the very last boss fight go completely brain-afk (standing still, only going invisible and visible again sometimes) while the boss can't hit you at all is also still working and allows to just kill the knights with whatever you feel like, grab the orbs for 3x buff and burst down the boss in a single phase easily, given that you can even keep your ult for the boss.
---
There's several more shorter skips, but most of them (beside the last one iirc) aren't on youtube afaik, but you do get to know they pretty damn fast if you simply check out the specific rooms after you cleared them or while learning methods for skips in other instances (sword-flying i learned for LW was pretty useful for example).
---
If you use all of them, it pretty much boilds down to; First encounter - skip - ogre - trashmobs - brainafk boss fight.
---
Trust me man. You will have those days where you make no progress and lose like 400 glory. But some days you gain like 700, you just need to find a group that works well with you. I have changed my comp group several times and I sometimes find nore success with randoms and add them afterwards. I'm still on the grind as well, but I'm optimistic.
---
You got this man
---
He will be the one to exile Calus and reform the Cabal Empire as Dominus of the Red Legion.
---
That‚Äôs how the bungie fangirls are. They‚Äôre to ignorant to see they are buying exotics that they already paid for in D1. Just to prove my point all the snowflakes are complaining about the last word which just got released in D2. To dumb to realize they bought a weApon they already owned SHEEP 
---
Nice. Gratz on the luck
---
Can a gun have negative recoil?
---
they hated u/Sneaksrevenge because he told the truth
---
So every other FPS?
---
I just need the goddamn ship, but it won't drop
---
Same, I may be a trash titan player but it would different in good way
---
I've never gotten suspended, but I don't think you should be locked out of a match you were disconnected from by any means. I don't see any reason for it.
---
They could just nerf it in crucible.
---
Agree with him being the Speaker but there‚Äôs also Myelin making great content, it‚Äôs a hard choice,
---
Ahh, cool...and yeah, that glide thing is awesome! It's really helpful to scout/kill annoying little pests that like to hide only to keep poking you from behind.
---
I would for control especially since I got phoenix protocol recently. Very underrated.
---
Beautiful!
---
Oathkeepers are the best looking hunter arms, so many shaders look sweet with them.  To bad it's a very niche exotic.
---
That's good to know...I guess most people have one of each character anyway.
---
Oathkeepers have eluded me this far as well. Feels bad man
---
You spent 60 on forsake and the pass. Year one gear is suppose to obsolete because its an evolving game while in year 2 game 2. Your exotics from d1 are still heavily used compared to Y2 exotics.
---
If you we given EVERYTHING the first time you grinded the raid or mission, then it wouldnt be a grind then... your issue isnt with destiny, its with the RNG gods...
---
People are different, i personally enjoy the grind for new gear, new titles or exotics... some people want things handed to them for a sense of accomplishment, others just want and ask for too much but dont understand the development process of a game, let alone the "keeping the lifespa " of the game intact past release date... 
---
In the end to each there own... now i didnt spend a dime in d2 until it became free because of d1's woes and the d2 vanilla launch... that still doesnt mean its a well rounded lootem and shootem title
---
Only one more day haha
---
You can try asking on the official Destiny 2 app, this subreddit's discord server (linked in upper right corner), the /r/destinythegame discord server (linked in their sidebar), /r/destinysherpa, or this PC Looking for Group discord server: https://discord.gg/UEhwdH You must have link previews enabled in discord settings in order to join it. 
---
They buffed most of the old supers with the TLW patch
---
Ayyyyyyy! It was great running with you dude, you killed it!
---
Nah this looks like a Kamehameha that is still going for a while. It's perfect.
---
Glad to hear bud! Good to see you found a good team. 
---
Not really capable of that on my OG Xbox one lol. Half the game would go by before it switched.
---
Thanks ^-^ They were great, just SOS and the challenges now :3
---
You ever play D1 bud? Random rolls were a thing from the get go, so no armor was absolute, as far as I can remember, my issue isn‚Äôt with the RNG gods. My issue is that something I spent hours grinding for, and days and weekends, was made entirely obsolete. The point of grinding for these armors and weapons isn‚Äôt so when new shit comes out it‚Äôs useless. It‚Äôs should be useable, viable and all around useful because that‚Äôs the point of end game armor and I should be able to flex these armors 
---
As a Hunter main I feel personally attacked. 
---
I actually get shot at pretty much everytime I pop it in quickplay. The sweatiest don't unless they are in super like this clip.
---
Just deposit after every location change or as soon as you get 5 motes, whichever comes first.  Don't worry about getting to 10 or 15, just BANK THOSE MOTES
---
Should go without saying that you should not rush into an area either.  Try to flank your way in and don't let yourself get surrounded.
---
1. I don't think it's certain that there will be another annual pass. Last year there wasn't an annual pass, just a season pass that got you Curse of Osiris and Warmind. 
---
2. No DLC activities ever disappear. The only limited time content are holiday events, like the Dawning and the upcoming Crimson Days. Sometimes activities are removed temporarily due to overwhelmingly bad player feedback (faction rallies, trials of the nine), or technical issues, but actual gameplay you pay money for stays forever. 
---
3. We currently know nothing about D3. People just assume it was being worked on because Bungie and Activision had a contract to make 3 games over 10 years. 
---
Mission status: 
---
S I C K
---
Pha shield break and disorient on the one i scrapped just yesterday 
---
HOT DAMN
---
If it was harder than you thought they maybe those two 650s werent experienced enough.  
---
At 650 solo is pretty much a breeze with solid strats, two people lets you fuck around without strats and still complete it without wiping. Three people is overkill honestly, not a single encounter requires you to have that much firepower.
---
@\_m0sley: I'm down for running the Leviathan (first timer, any raid). Really want the Midnight Coupe and Legend of Acrius. If you don't mind I'll send a friend request tonight after work, I'm on PC/Titan 650, Rasplankton#1998
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah agreed
---
Agree, solo is too easy and its borderline "farmable". Solo flawless sounds like the way to go.  
---
I'd like to see titles for things like this rather than rng-badges-and-shitton-grind.  
---
..
---
Rivensbane for flawless last wish raid, Cursebreaker for flawless solo shattered throne etc.
---
What you don't have I have.
---
Because quickfang has a sexy running animation.
---
r/enlightenedbirdmen
---
Midnight Coup is awesome. I have a masterworked one on all 3 characters. Never leaves my inventory!
---
Sure, shoot a friend request to m0sley#2865. Definitely down for a Leviathan run tonight. Again, anyone else is welcome to join.
---
If i had it, I would have used it
---
Tbh it wasn't that bad.
---
Yeah i did it after forgetting to go back to well in an ep run and the super went on from start to finish. Its savage. 
---
*super
---
Wonder why they pulled it early ?
---
i mean I like to kill everyone but I  would rather to play 5 games to position you in the range you deserve
---
Yeah, that's all that really matters: getting the ship - so it would be great if there was a surefire way to get the ship at least.  Its super annoying waiting 3 weeks and then having to farm it over and over for a ship I'll never use, but that is a means to an end (the title).
---
You can free up your exotic slot by using hammerhead or play of the game too. And those might net you more than 1 kill xD. 
---

Titan gang we out here

At least we hunters have void abilities this time around...........
---
needless to say, the TSA agents dont like the drifter anymore

Nice best feelings ever using them guns.

This would be better https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5aec114a19ee861f008b4855-750-370.jpg
---
Bro I was and still am a titan main I had a damn bubble the didnt do damage to people so I feel your pain
---
Colonel died in Cayde's place and got taxidermied 
---
i would love to see some legitimate concept art that you could come up with for destiny.  your artwork is seriously good.
---
The PvP class is good at PvP. That‚Äôs kinda how it‚Äôs supposed to work.
---
They aren‚Äôt OP. Spectral Blades lasts too long, but the other supers are fair. 
---
Absolutely, 11/10 on style. I was just being informational just in case people want to be more competitive while using chaos reach in the crucible
---
If everybody on R/destiny agreed you‚Äôd still be a minority 
---
I just feel as if it would turn out kinda like the Halo reach flying missions (can't recall the mission names but I know there were 2 you fly 80% or more) 
---
A third of the people LOVED them
---
A third of the people HATED them 
---
And the last third was in the middle 
---
I was personally in the middle and got tired of them in the end but I also understand why people liked that, the only issue with that is they'd have to put weapons or something on your ship, also I believe but could be wrong your ghost is the one that really flies the ship ? 
---
Hit the nail right on the head.
---
Yeah I banged out around 30 in 1.5 days and it was rough. Felt good to complete the flawless raid and equip the seal though! 
---
I dont want all of the random shit eververse gives you in my other engrams. Legendary engrams and vendors engrams are to get random rolls on weapons not to get an emote that is the way it works and the majority of us are fine with it. Also, eververse isn't the way bungie makes its money for dlcs we pay for the dlcs. Cosmetic items are not content it is shit that doesn't matter at all when playing the game. If you want more shit from eververse play the game more. 
---
it's simple solo queue = get queued only with and against other solo queue players
---
duo queue = get queued with and against other duo queued players
---
and so on....
---
This should have been severely shortened 
---
So I've been trying to get it for the last 2 days, I've spent 7 hrs doing the draw part but when I kill the wizards and break the crystal, I wait a little after breaking it then I jump, but it doesn't switch from "find enkarr" to "stop enkarr" do you have any ideas on what I should do?
---
You sir (or ma'am) and your friend have my love (no homo) I seen every other auto rifle video but none on 450s until now thank you both (friend for making you for sharing)üíô

A hand cannon.

The title.
---
Yup. One eyed mask though... Shit ain't OP at all amirite?
---
Those are some Hard Truths
---
quick peak into your post history shows **you** were playing D2 over a year ago, meaning you paid full or near full price for a ‚Äòdestiny 1 remake‚Äô. 
---
hypocrite scrub
---
Damn things don't even orbit right. Why are your engines on. You're high enough to not need them.

They make me so angry... Nevermind some questionable Aerodynamic choices in their design.

But yeah a ship battle would be cool nonetheless.

You're just a tiny person.. Someone who didn't get loved enough. You'll learn soon enough when the world gobbles you up that know one gives a shit.. Grow up little child lmao.. 
---
The Last word, you can't go wrong with that handcannon. 
---
No offense u but sound line a biased pc fanboy ripping on consoles. Lol. They dont look aweful. Obviously pc is going to look better but u also have to pay 3xs as much as a console which on my opinion isnt nearly worth it. I know pc can run at 60 fps. That's about the only thing I wish consoles could play destiny at.  Otherwise most of that other shit is hardly noticeable. When u play games like Horizon and GOW or Incharted 4 on the pro on a 4ktv, the grapghics are way to close to what a pc can do for pc players to RIP on consoles. I appreciate the info though.  I knew some of it. Just not all.  
---
I have all characters maxed out and decked in raid gear, claiming everybody would do something makes you look a fool
---
Malfeasance
---
It's decent about 60-70% of the time in my experience but also the other 30-40... Nothing needs said 
---
That edit was crazy smooth. I watched the video before reading the description and I had a 'wait what' moment, lol.
---
How does claiming everyone would complain about it make me look like a fool if everyone did already complain about a similar mask and got it nerfed almost immediately ....?
---
I'd say more power to you but you need to be needed 
---
How

Who is my name is byf and what is he speaking for?

We should lock them in the thunderdome and whoever survives will be the new speaker.

---
I thought you were the one flying the ship. Like when your ghost said fly faster. 
---
But if the missions and feel of flying is right then a lot more people would love it. 
---
I mean most ships seems like they have weapon systems already on them?
---
That's a good question. Supposedly we are getting 4 hand cannons with the pass in all but who knows what they might stick in there. 
---
haha, thanks!
---
People are saying it's Hawkmoon
---
I say we let them settle it in the crucible.
---
I feel like you're an actual engineer or some sorts lol. 
---
Take my upvote that was a good one. Irritating but a good oneüòë
---
Agreed
---
That's incredible. Love the detail.
---
four keys for one box
---
Thank you!! 
---
What in the neckbeard is going on here?
---
I hate him more.
---
We need more clips of this. I don‚Äôt know what the last word quest did to crucible but everyone is just playing so passively now, it‚Äôs honestly disgusting.
---
Downvoted by the PVP apes, I feel you. Crucible is cancer and everyone who takes it seriously too. 
---
You said "Cosmetic items aren't content" and "it doesn't matter when I'm playing the game." That isn't true in the slightest.  Granted, you don't get any special advantages or benefits form cosmetic items, but having extra ways to customize your character and/or weapons is something that all players enjoy.  I myself always want my character to look cool and have powerful weapons and armor.  I shouldn't have to choose between one or the other.  I know people who couldn't care less about how their Guardian looks, but I'm not one of those people.  As a player, I should be able to have a cool looking character who is also powerful.  
---
I guess it depends on the presentation of it. I'd recognize both almost instantly 
---
Exactly
---
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie. 
---
Yeah aside from looks, Dreaming City/Last wish armor is better for the chance at enhanced perks.  Some of the Forge stuff looks amazing with the right shaders but I'm hard pressed to give up my enhanced perks.
---
It's not that hard to be worth a title. Get the Whisper and wreck it.
---

I didn‚Äôt mean one eyed. People are mistaking it. I literally meant Eternal and Khepris
---
r/Fireteams
---
Did Kevin Hart say this somewhere? 
---
It appears hard for the first time. Subsequent runs will be a piece of cake, no worries.
---
Last word, cuz that‚Äôs all ppl use these days.
---
Couldent he just require it? Or is it random? 
---
Gambit is trash, the meta sucks. I match up against 4stacks who somehow memorised the fucking invader spawns, yet my team thinks jumping across the map with 14 motes to grab that last one from under the nose of 3 vandals is a smart play. 
---
Crucible sucks, the meta is trash. Everyone runs Sniper, Hand cannon or shotgun. PVP Titan apes with One eyed Mask have ruined rumble, Spectral blades """nerf""" ruins any other mode. 
---
The only fun thing in this game is solo PVE. Multiple runs of Shattered Throne? Yes please. 
---
also me chasing exotics.
---
Tbh I love the forge armor. It's unique in my opinion with the overall detailed shape and extra little bars on gauntlets and legs. The only thing I don't like is the hunter cloak 
---
Oh whoops my mistake I thought black talon was what you got from the Mars caches. Yeah that‚Äôs pretty good
---
My first exotic &lt;3
---
Ugh man I tried for 6 hours and just couldn't do it ;0;  
---
I felt so defeated...
---
Even if a voice is forced it can still be a nice or awesome voice, heck most voices in a lot of things are forced to sound better, more iconic or overall more pleasant. Plus people have different tastes in what voices they like and that's fine, but just insulting that person or people just because you yourself dislike their voice is just rude and disrespectful.
---
P.s. Just saying a voice is "forced" isn't enough to be an insult or a criticism, it's just a bland statement with no meaning
---
P.P.s. Bruh you can obviously tell from my random ass description that I was being sarcastic and joking, don't need to get all defensive and snark faced cause of it haha
---
Member when strike bosses were actually bosses? Oh, I member
---
Ok cool so then he got the grips from xur
---
)Yeah like his biggest special. Starts at about [1:10](https://youtu.be/70gme6lL86o
---
And armor, he was quite specific about wanting to run Phoenix protocol. Of course you'll have to unequip whatever exotic you run otherwise first.. and possibly weapons to match whatever his Phoenix Protocol has unflinching for. And then a helmet for better targetting with that weapon. and possibly a different energy/kinetic too.
---
What made you think that these quests are worth making another post?
---
Understood. It's just so counter intuitive to let go off my outlaw+rampage Go Figure now that I've got it lol.
---
But as I understand, infusing a weapon with a stronger LL weapon that's exactly the same doesn't cost anything? Or did I miss something?
---
Celestial nighthawk can one shot the meatball

I really want my touch of malice

Thank you so much :)))

I post all the time :) u/fragdoll117

Hell yeah yo.. I also can not wait for division 2 
---
Loooool
---
You mean the Blood Dome?
---
Brb, creeping through that post history üëÄ
---
Nobody likes to play against a full team of shotgun apes that blade barrage with Not Forgotten or Luna's Howl 
---
You ever seen that video of the bird saying, "What the f***? WHAT THE F***?" That's me right now. You did a phenomenal job! I never would've guessed this was traditional media.
---
My favorite thing about duplicate exotics is that my dumbass probably already bought it from Xur just hours ago
---
Stop reloading after kills! Let the mag run out to take advantage of the extra damage on the bottom half of the mag!
---
I know, it‚Äôs force of habit, but you gotta try it out.
---
Hahahahahahaha, that was a great joke.
---
Let‚Äôs push this! If it wasn‚Äôt for him, I would know nothing about the lore of Destiny! His videos are just great
---
xbox. I don't have any say in who gets to join or not and I am not sure they always play warlocks. But I can ask or pm you the name of the clan.
---
That was his best standup IMO
---
This subreddit is littered with these senseless shitposts. Do not encourage them.
---
It's ok, let the smugness and apathy for the feelings of others run through you
---
Where is this?
---
Oi Meatball, have a void treat!
---
I wasn't sure how it was going to complete until I got some chances to play. After doing so, it became so blatantly obvious that about the only thing it shares with Destiny is being a future setting and you have guns and kill stuff. After that, it takes a huge departure towards other games. I continue to chuckle at this notion too because every article brings up Destiny, despite the fact that it's so much more like Warframe, Diablo, and The Division (from what I've heard, having never played that one myself).
---
Pyrrha BESTTTTTT GIRLLLLLLLLL
---
yeah me neither, that‚Äôs why I went to Bergusia because I wanted Jot√ºnn. This bow is actually suprisingly good, happy I got it
---

Even better: using the code of the missile to stay near the ceiling then dive down into the crowd like a human predator missile
---
No, it's D2 at the farm.
---
Ether harvest is the name of the public event. It is possible for the cryo pod and glimmer extraction public events to happen there, and there's no good way to tell which one it will be beforehand. 
---
When an ether harvest public event does happen, make sure you do damage to all three of the scorn chieftains that spawn near each of the three smaller servitors. 
---
What you see up there is about 20h of work
---
I think I got at least twenty duplicate since Christmats...
---
Hawkmoon
---
Did they change that? Used to use enhancement cores, legendary shards, and some planetary resources in addition to glimmer
---
Then why have them engine thrusters at the back end? 
---
If Bungie are gonna go magic engines then go all out. 
---
What in the world
---
I wasn't talking about Wish-ender, but the legendary bow from the raid
---
Oh yeah that's what we need, another exotic hand cannon...
---
Oh, I don't know why it didn't occur to me to bind jump to scroll for that. 
---
Thanks man. Vorgeth the cunt was definitely the hardest part.
---
I like the idea of taking someone from the lore community and putting them in the game somehow, but there are others who didn't have the history Byf has that I would put on the list before him.
---
But it's not like I would be upset if they actually did it and picked him either, he is a big name when it comes to lore and they have a thing for the big names with the streams and mp reveals and stuff.
---
It sucks because I restarted my Warlock and hit level 20, turned in weapons parts and now they're gone. Plus it's constantly telling me there's someone I need to talk to at the farm.
---
You don't have to do public events there if it isn't the right one. You don't even need to be on the Tangled Shore. Check for public event flags in Four Horn Gulch every four minutes or so, and travel there whenever you see a public event flag around the middle part of the area. If it turns out to be the wrong one, you can just leave and try again later. 
---
thats what i was looking for thank you! :)
---
Also got Jotun a few days ealier, all in all a great week too actually!
---
Wow you fuckin got em didnt ya 
---
Normal infusion (ie: of different weapons) requires those things, infusing one Go Figure into another is just Glimmer. 
---
Lucky I can't get the stupid rng quest to drop to complete the sniper rifle 
---
I literally pulled a season 3 sparrow yesterday It is just decreased drop rates. They decrease them to give higher odds on new items. You are an absolute joke. You dont even know that and you are trying to be a destiny youtuber. You try to deceive people by saying stupid shit like you cant pull stuff from past seasons and the game is pay to win. How about instead of guessing look into it. Also how about making a positive video about destiny instead of making negative rant videos and posting Instagram clips.
---
You killed the only 5 other players that still play destiny. Savage.
---
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Agree with all of y‚Äôall, it‚Äôs not a competition but if Bungie would ever decided to make a new speaker and it would be between them two they should let the community decided that ways we won‚Äôt be salt/pissed to go see the new speaker (is there‚Äôs ever one) that we don‚Äôt like, 
---
If you're running blade barrage the melee chain buff and the Sprint buff from frostees stack. Great for decimating adds
---
The engram isn't "gone," Banshee-44 will have it as soon as you get that character to the Tower. All NPCs will have an effect showing you should talk to them once you have enough tokens, gunsmith parts, or planet materials. 
---
Get the fuck out.
---
https://www.change.org/p/bungie-make-my-name-is-byf-the-new-speaker
---
If only there was a way for us to scroll past them without commenting.
---
Didnt u see that ttk
---
Hang in there man, you'll get it soon!
---
If you like the huckleberry, wait till you get the catalyst. Everybody says riskrunner but a full refill of mag on every kill and rampage stacked without a reload. Yeah I use it more the risk Runner and you can still use Ikelos shotty 
---
OH! Alright, I'll keep that in mind when I'm infusing from now on
---
I was thinking about a new speaker, I mean how are they talking to the traveler
---
Nah I'm PS4 sadly and r/fireteams isn't helping
---
we just caught a glimpse, a mere fraction of the potential destructive power that is stored within the ominous presence in society. shaggy, we recognize you work in mysterious ways. thank you for giving us a taste.
---
In the black garden 
---
I re-read your post. Yeah, my bad 
---
Terribly sorry there seems to have been a mistake but that Queenbreaker was actually supposed to be mine...
---
Idk man I still can‚Äôt see it
---
I mean, I do that anyway in comp. Control means I switch to bubble Titan, and then I throw on a shotty and switch from OEM to Synthoceps. It‚Äôs not difficult to do.
---
&gt; I have all characters maxed out and decked in raid gear
---
Oh you're tough. 
---
You‚Äôre breaking Rule 5 bud. Delete this shit.
---
100? Really? Go big or go home my guys, petitions are already basically worthless but a 100 signature one is basically nothing 
---
This guy is very condescending. I dont want him to be a part of the world I spend time in.
---
Is this really an issue?
---
I'm 27 and we have people from age 40+ all the way down to.. i think 12 and there wasn't even remotely any issue at any point about this. lol
---
?
---
It increases as the number of people increase. I don't think theres a cap
---
Some say the kid's still out there dancing to this day.
---
Either works
---
Woah how do you learn so many lore sfuff?
---
Shattered Throne and Whisper are the two best things currently in Destiny. 
---
That was because I forgot to, so I did it for anyone that missed it, and because I didn't know who missed it I did it for the first 20 people
---
I am not trying to sound rude but it is a pretty easy weapon to get.
---
Shaxx obviously he‚Äôs always talking shit on crucible 
---
Coincidence
---
I know there's not a cap but if the goal is too low it'll reach it and make people feel like they don't have to sign it anymore. All about that psychology my guy
---
Then why does golden gun only have 3 or 6 bullets instead of 8?
---
Coincidence. The drop rates on that and Le'Monarque seem to be pretty high though anyway. *Remember you only have two chances a week to get it.
---
yes, there was a hvt but still

---
Just coincidence. Grats on the Jotunn drop, though!
---
Makes sense. Saladin did say it wasn't over until Shaxx sang and he is very shy. 
---
Lol what? Hunters are the squishiest class by far. Least resilience and least recovery. All we have is "mobility" that doesn't affect run speed. 
---
Is that Colin off Bandersnatch?
---
What seems to increase drop rate is forging a powerful frame. Getting Jotunn or Le Monarque from a non-powerful black armory frame is rare enough that a lot of people don't believe it's possible and that everyone who said they had that happen is mistaken. 
---
&gt; Hunter grenades are not worse, they are bad ass
---
I can see you don't actually play as a Hunter. We have objectively the worst grenades in the game, along with the worst melee abilities. 
---
The Earth in Destiny is supposed to be the real Earth in the future. Enjoy your epiphany. 
---
Might be hard to make it so there can be more people, but I'd be totally for it
---
Rule 6 - - No advertising. 
---
Its at 320 some people rn
---
Guardian, only the powerful frames at Bergusia. 
---
Everything I've read states only from the powerful frame. 
---
Exotic hand cannon. It‚Äôs from one of the vanilla planet quests. Really good for headshots, packs a hard punch
---
I‚Äôm not mad at what to do I‚Äôm mad that this is the third thing I have to do. I just want the gun already
---
It isn't a Luna's howl for sure but it is very effective. Insane stability and instant death if you manage to land 5 body shots on an opponent and they're still not dead. In Gambit it's excellent as you would expect and in day to day PvE it can be pretty alright. It's definitely not OP by any stretch of the definition, but it's got fantastic fun factor. Keep up the grind!
---
it's really not that hard...plus ur missing out on a whole nother gameplay element to Destiny 2 yes it can be frustrating but it's honestly really fun
---
I don‚Äôt have it 
---
I used trust from Gambit drops for this one, but others could work.
---
We all did this months ago. Quit crying 
---
I run chaperone and stomp-EE5
---
with trust and a real nice strykers surhand
---
Crooked fang as a heavy
---
And to synergize top tree gunslinger
---
Decked out completely for pvp 
---
Takes a bit of skill to pull off but that's what I'm going for 
---
at Max rng got him 3 exotics, cuz 2 are quest related and xur sold the ahamkara gauntlets. he also could've gotten the robes from xur, so rng had nothing to do with at least half of those 6 exotics. that being said, he was lucky for those exotics that he did get thru rng.
---
Trust is good.tpp.
---
Sorry man it's an exotic quest you shouldnt be surprised by the length
---
Just wait until you get the last word quest or malfeasance or get to the end of Luna‚Äôs howl or literally any other gun quest in the game 
---
Easily offended is just an excuse to insult people with inpunity. Especialy when what he said was in no way meant to mean anything other than how I took it, but like you say. To each his own. I get my lore from myleen gaming and never feel like this guy thinks he is better than me because he has to educate me on some lore.
---
I think when Gambit was first introduced, your power level mattered a little bit for fighting enemies. Now, the enemies are equally brutal for everyone and power level only matters for fighting other players. This was changed quite some time ago, though. 
---
I‚Äôm  sorry I don‚Äôt have money to pay for Black Armory to have access to all the great guns that you guys have 
---
Jotun is awesome for that too if you have it/can get it. 
---
I see. I might just suck at the game lol.
---
Crimson hand cannon is good for that it's what I used
---
I shall alert the Inquisition immediately. Emperor save us
---
I'm currently running mayhem \*laughs in Australian and then melts\*

Trust works so does Annual Skate (legendary Y1)
---
Yep, it's really like I'm playing D1 again with every other person using The Last Word. (And with Thorn coming soon, ohboi.)

ohboi

No shit it‚Äôs a game

You need it. Trust me
