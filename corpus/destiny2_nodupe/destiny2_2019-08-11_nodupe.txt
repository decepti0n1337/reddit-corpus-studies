Are you asking can you expand your light level while only owning shadowkeep?
---
The most fun? Titan and max grenade Regen, Middle Tree Defender and Heart of Inmost. Everyone and everything is either dead or suppressed.....ALL THE TIME
---
Thanks, but one question; what does the thing in the bus give you?
---
It disappeared when I shot it with my smg
---
I‚Äôm a titan and refuse to run one eyed mask. I also won‚Äôt run jotunn in crucible anymore. I‚Äôve had too many deaths from that bullshit.
---
They can already 1 shot you with their shoulder, they dont need any other blunt force weapon

That has nothing to do with them, people are going to play (or not play) however they want, and unless these players are breaking Bungie‚Äôs terms of service, then they won‚Äôt do nor do they HAVE to do anything. You‚Äôre gonna end up in these scenarios and they‚Äôre going to suck, but that‚Äôs what happens with Online Games.

---
Also, you‚Äôre on the Winning team, what the Hell are you complaining about?
---
I‚Äôm right there with you. At least it‚Äôs a finite number of matches even if you lose every one (200). Play rumble. If you get 2nd place it counts as a win, if you get 3rd it doesn‚Äôt kill your streak.
---
I got it in 4 runs. I know that there are people still running it religiously for it, but the thrill of actually getting them to drop is way better than paying someone to do it for you.
---
Hunters are about utility and warlocks and titans are about damage, invisibility is OP, I know because I made a hunter build all around being invisible. Hunters have truesight, also op, they also get a melee tree (arc) that's actually better than a titan melee build. They get smoke bombs, the best vertical game play in the game with stompeez, I could go on
---
I said the opulent armor in my original comment
---
Wtf why does that look so good
---
It's not much but its honest work.
---
Forget it.....
---
This may be a stupid question but uh...
---
How is this Bungie's fault? At all?
---
I think they teabagging dead body of Anthem
---
Top 3 in Rumble counts as a win.
---
Is this a real....serious....question?
---
I cannot believe people are actually saying botting is fucking okay right now lmfao these morons are unbelievable
---
Yes it was. I never opened any more packages after getting the armor step done.
---
I cryyyyyy when Uldren deserves to diiiiiiiie.
---
It's an added effect
---
Honestly, no. I still get farmed by people running pinnacle weapons in rumble. I suck. I can barely get .5 efficiency when I play crucible, I should never be in a match with anyone that has ground Luna's or Not Forgotten.
---
I'm a simple person. This made me laugh. Thank you.
---
Space is haunted
---
so this is what self hatred does to you.
---

Another stupid question, when I complete all the drained armour set requirements, does it tell me then how to get majestic armour? Would I have to talk to that lady in the tower? Thanks again
---

All good just try to make sure you understand what your buying in virtual in game stores

Thanks

I love my revoker clearly you share my opinion

I too have no life
---
This was my second ever micro transaction after a rocket league car! And I screwed it up! :P
---
Sorry man I play pc
---
Did they nerf it?
---
I‚Äôm missing one thing. That damn helmet.
---
Don‚Äôt worry bro I got it
---
I‚Äôm with you here. Lol
---
If you masterwork one set and have a purple set on another character as well it will transfer. But you have to have it first
---
Yeah and austringer is now the better 140 hc
---
Thanks for the upvote!
---
I play all 3 classes equally. Honestly they‚Äôre all the same amount of fun. 
---
For pve, warlock is currently the strongest followed by Hunter.
---
So you should just buy it on battle.net asap?
---
Destiny servers are going down forever have you not heard
---
Anybody know what day this changes?
---
You just don‚Äôt understand the entire point of the move. A hunter dodge is supposed to be used on reaction to something. You use the barrier or rift as a control. You don‚Äôt push someone and try it. You pop a barricade or rift as you‚Äôre taking a zone and some poor hunter is trying to fight you and boom instant advantage.
---
If you want more speed I want a hunter dodge to give me a full overshield. Sounds about right
---
Lol my face after I got headseeker + rangefinder + counterbalance on my bygones. Every time I use it I drop 40-50 kill games because I get recluse procd
---
I want a new besieged-type game mode where it‚Äôs just a whole fire team of guardians defending the city walls from waves of Fallen or hive. And we get to pick up weapons like that and mow them down when they try to climb up.
---
DU-DUDU-DU-DUDUDUUUUUUUU

Fan art of fan art
---
O.o new goal for tomorrow thank you.
---
It's still great but I hardly see it (on PC) but I see like 3 austringers minimum each game
---
10/10 will recommend to come back. I came back around May and havent regret it since. Been able to catch back up with all 3 characters and now im just running raids for clears and doing exotic quests etc
---
i got a headache from this

---
Through the fire and flood, Truth (mini version) and no land beyond.
---
After spending god knows how long just getting the remaining 190 kills to get Suro's Catalyst masterworked I'm not too enthused about having to get another 300 kills with another gun. Especially one in a class I suck ass in.
---
This sounds more like you being bad and blaming pinnacle weapons, many of the best weapons in the meta aren‚Äôt pinnacle (erentil, AoS, twilight oath)and not all of the pinnacle are insane.
---
No no that's Arkborn when one of your teammates fills up one of the Hive posts you're going to, to keep you from depositing the souls you have.
---
Yep.
---
It's blank?
---
I'm downloading the new content...fuck that's a big update lol
---
Do you mean fully masterwork EVERY piece and it transfers over?
---
Very similar but personally I like the Arentil the best
---
Yup. But its worth it i would say, theres also the seals and titles that completionists can work towards.
---
Apart from oem yes
---
Uh-oh you're on Drifter's bad side.
---
Your dlc on pc stays on pc, you‚Äôll have to buy all new dlc if you don‚Äôt own it already for your Xbox. Does that answer it?If you already own dlc ok the Xbox when u transfer from pc to Xbox everything transfers if you have dlc if not dlc content will remain locked.
---
They lying tho.
---
Only the best blueberries use sunshot.
---
Fuckin true.
---
Yeah this is really true I dont think I changed my super load out outside of when viking funeral was nerfed
---
This photo makes shaxx look like he has a beer belly lol
---
I think we could use more options but I think trees are also good because it allows really powerful super or neutral game builds without breaking the game
---
You always run the risk of broken combos when you change something as fundamental as supers and you cant lie we already have some. However even if they did change the supers to be more like this they could always put out hotfixes and do whatever they need to to balance the game.
---
get a load of this guy
---
Very weird to hear the German Shaxx. He's very tame in comparison. 
---
Nice win.
---
Gonna be tough to have the true experience unless u group up with others with similar ‚Äústandard‚Äù light for the content. Bungie only lets u have an advantage for +20 power level ne way so dw if ure way above a power requirement. As long as ure having fun with the game. Id focus on getting ready for shadowkeep
---
Just had a sherpa teach me, 2 clanmates, and 2 other randoms Crown of Sorrow.
---
We started to fail a lot from the 2nd to last encounter but he continued and made sure we will see a completion at the end of it, and was never salty/toxic the entire time.
---
Now I'm closer to getting that MMXIX title, thanks to him :D
---
No. Bungo is pulling the plug on D2 next week confirmed. Enjoy it while it lasts boys

Did you try plugging it in
---
Future War Cult
---
Yes lol
---
Bruh. You're the one that's trying to tell me that I think it's all about me. That came out of no where and makes zero sense.
---
Makes me think of my one eyed pale skin black haired gothic Titan
---
I'm talking about the original post and just commented on the thread ? Like damn no need to flame me
---
Yeah other games aren't a problem, just destiny. I think my problem has something to do with all the security I have on my network, so I just need to disable some of that security
---
What platform?
---
Again, you tried telling me that I thought life was all about me and that came out of no where, and for no reason. Don't play the victim card here dude.
---
Nah, there‚Äôs a laundry list of reasons why crucible is trash. Just ask a majority of the community
---
Fair enough. I find it odd and somewhat funny though that of everyone, you're the least emotional about me stating my opinion about your post. In fact you don't seem to be at all. 
---
Kudos.
---
The first thing I think is this hunter is thicccccc, what is wrong with me
---
Nice.
---
Ya because I mentioned thunderlord first because of what the other two people said, since I thought it was applicable and you commented back saying "I didn't mention the thunderlord" as if I were explicitly speaking to you. So I said it's not all about you mate because you're straight tripping right now üòÇ I'm not playing the victim card hahaha get that gaslight shit outta here
---
i mean, its a meme i edited at 2 in the morning. thats why
---
I‚Äôm a bit late but hope you had a happy birthday
---
Yeah go back to xbox &gt; cable &gt; router (basic set up).
---
Destiny and other people commenting in here: "I have no mouth but I must scream"
---
I Mean you did comment on my post, not reply to someone else's comment.
---
A man‚Äôs game*
---
What
---
Don‚Äôt,don‚Äôt give me hope
---
No I am not saying your opinion is wrong but the corrupted is the worst because she just moves everywhere and is like a upgraded taken boop guy and has a shield and it‚Äôs just the worst
---
It has the potential to be the most challenging with the right modifiers. This makes it the best Strike. 
---
A lack of difficulty DOES NOT make an activity better.
---
Same i just completed it on my 2nd character and I‚Äôm thinking whether or not I should even do my 3rd
---
Right because you made a post and it's immediately your safe space and only people who'll turn it into an echo chamber of baby bullshit can post üòÇ
---
In Shadowkeep, Tess might offer a ‚Äòbest of year 2‚Äô engram similar to this year‚Äôs ‚Äòbest of year 1‚Äô engram. You might be able to get this emote.
---
Don't quote other comments unless you reply to it. There's a reason I was confused when you mentioned thunderlord. Stop. Playing. The. Victim. Card.
---
Song?
---
They should make a ship that‚Äôs one of those guys and the loading screen is instant
---
Ayyyye, The Boys! Great show.
---
I still use Graviton Lance. It's my pissed off weapon. When I get killed one too many times by that one pussy using Luna's or Not Forgotten, or all those FaZe wannabes in the Crucible now, I equip Graviton. And I'm a force to be reckoned with when I have it on. Sue me. I'll win.
---
I'm the 3rd comment in the thread üòÇ you just wanna flame people get over yourself
---
yeah I also have them with 3 different rolls but now I have 4 since the roll is perfect for pvp
---
Must suck to have the pve meta consist of mostly pvp weapons
---
I'm the 3rd comment in the thread üòÇ you just wanna flame / argue, get over yourself. I'm not claiming to be the victim of anything. I'm just saying youre a fucking narcissist
---
Hope you get banned from D2 for your dumb thoughts
---
I pretty much made my warlock in to a tank, I have shot mobility and that sucks but my regen was always high and I can Nova Bomb the shit out if whatever stands in my way, after doing solstice and getting back to playing as my Hunter (just finished everything except Masterwork for him) I fell in love again with his movement but idk, for some reason I love roaming around as a warlock, sometimes I'll put his mobility up and use blink and that's fun as Hell.
---
If mini bosses count as 5 now, you only to kill 10. I should've been more patient. 
---
Just like the mountain top quest.
---
Nothing about PVP is made with a player like you in mind. Nor should your opinion have any sort of weight when making PVP decisions. Not trying to be rude, but you said it yourself, you only go into the crucible when ‚Äúforced.‚Äù. I‚Äôm not even going to touch your poor choice of words there. Why would devs spend the time or resources to take the concerns of a player who doesn‚Äôt want to play that portion of the game in the first place into consideration? Honestly, all you‚Äôre little rant accomplished is showing how myopic and immature your perspective is at the age of 38. Do you think PvP focused players enjoy being ‚Äúforced‚Äù to grind Raids for enhanced perks on armor to take into PVP? Nope. But you don‚Äôt see woe is me rants in the threads by these players because they understand the game doesn‚Äôt revolve solely around their wants for the part of the game they focus on. If you don‚Äôt want to encounter pinnacle PVP loadouts, then don‚Äôt play PVP. If you‚Äôre ‚Äúforced‚Äù participation in the torture of PVP is so terrible that you just can‚Äôt handle it to earn a few rewards, then idk what to tell you other than tough luck. Maybe be an adult about the situation. Also, you must have the worst luck I‚Äôve ever seen in matchmaking, or you‚Äôre wildly exaggerating the amount of stacks full of pinnacle loadouts you run into. I spend as much time in PVP as anyone in the game and I rarely run into an NF, let alone multiple NF‚Äôs on the same team in QP. I own NF, worked my ass off to earn it, and rarely use it outside of comp because it feels like an unnecessary flex in QP. Most comp players welcome the opportunity to finally take off the standard pinnacle weapons, shotties, and Wardcliffs that are basically required to compete at high levels of PVP so they can use something else that might not be as competitive, but is more fun or simply provides a different way to play. Players with the skill to earn pinnacle weapons, especially toward legend rank skill levels, could stomp you using anything in the game. Some people have NFL talent, some people won‚Äôt ever even see the field on the JV high school team. That‚Äôs life.
---
That post felt really damn condescending, I‚Äôm honestly surprised it got that many awards.
---
As a titan main... change?
---
Goddamnit... I literally just did the mini boss thing an hour ago with my Hunter, but at least when I do it with my Titan and help my wife with hers it'll be easier...

I have all the DLCs and whatnot, my Titan and Hunter are both 750, but my Warlock is only 312 and I haven't completed any of the campaigns aside from the Red War. Is it possible Cayde is still there for me on my Warlock?
---
Oh its great, but I reckon MnK changes things a bit
---
Hahah wasn't really.. did it while watching YouTube so would have done that anyway, and felt like I used my time to create something I suppose.

Why: it was mostly for my boyfriend, he loves the game and has played it a long time so I wanted to surprise him with something when he came to visit.

pretty accurate

If you have a helmet with hand cannon targeting and have a decent Duke 44, Austringer, or Trust that you can put a target adjuster on, you should be getting headshots a lot easier

That's really sweet. My girlfriend just tells me to shut the game off üòÖ

Titans together strong

And I still am...
---
Gather materials such legendary shards and Ecores in prep for shadowkeep. Either through normal means or the forge 'method'. I wouldn't worry about getting top notch gear because it's going to change in sk.

But yes faq's will probably have more for you.

---
What is it
---
That gives me a bit of hope, thanks! Any tips on how to get the 1500 orbs though?
---
Ethically, isn't that the same as swatting someone?
---
No, asking if Shadowkeep is an isolated game/version of Destiny or if a new player starts at Lvl 1 with no light and has to go through the whole D2 campaign from the beginning.
---
The toaster kills mini bosses in 3 shots or two and some primary... easily done solo.
---
Now you can say you‚Äôre cool.
---
The time investment isn't completely wasted in the following year. Y1 Solstice armour became irrelevant as soon as Forsaken launched. Participating in the event this year should have a longer lasting reward.
---
Their minds are going to be blown with how fast it can be melted once they get their ikelos Shotgun
---
I find groups that want to throw games as I don't want to ruin the fun for my teammates!
---
Trust me, this is not the set up you want.
---
It's simple,  put the game in and start playing! On a real note,  there is a ton of stuff for you yo do, just have to pick and choose what it is you want to do.
---
Ah hero :)
---
And it was at this moment, I almost* messed up.
---
If you‚Äôre on console, it is still amazing

If I see you in the comp battlefield, I will rush your ass with my LOW and be a awful person by using it and then probably go cry in the shower

Most Crucible missions is the exact opposite of that :/
---
Nice color scheme
---
Respect. I just know connotation can be hard to read and it doesn‚Äôt help that im not very good at putting my thoughts down on paper/internet just never been good at writing
---
I think it‚Äôs the most fun class in the game. I‚Äôm a titan main, by the way. They have such high DPS (I know goldy does too). The nova bomb class is so fun. There are lots of little hidden skills, like the devour perk, or the handheld nova. The chaos reach is ridiculous for DPS too. The solar class I don‚Äôt love, but as a support with radiance, you‚Äôll also be cherished, especially in raids. All around, a really fun damage dealing class. They are stereotypically a glass cannon so if you can stack resilience that will help. The only negative imo is the jump, I feel like you kinda just float around out there. This is all from a PvE standpoint, because I only play PvE when I have to. I say give it a try. There are some cool exotics for the armor as well.
---
That ALMOST made me forget how much I hate Reckoning. 
---
No small feat, I assure you.
---
Nice cock
---
Damn that sucks
---
Back in the days when it was broken? Yeah we only can anything when we have something broken. We need Warlock melees man.
---
Precisely. Lol
---
I just played with a stormcaller that wrecked the other team. Idk, I‚Äôm sure different players use different things that work better for them personally
---
Honestly Risk Runner during the boss ads is basically just a free Super.
---
The other day i was in EP. We were on the last wave and everyone else had abandoned me so i was doing it on my own. I was fighting the ogre when suddenly i was at low health. An acolyte got me from behind while he was hiding behind a rock and along comes some thrall. The cheeky cunt started hitting my corpse and crouched twice before walking away with two of his mates.
---
Not gonna lie though, i absolutely love the hive.
---
Can confirm. I‚Äôve used my Luna‚Äôs as both a 180rpm and the now nerfed 150rpm. If you don‚Äôt have NF, using Luna‚Äôs is still the next best thing on console. 
---
Great job btw! Congrats and enjoy.
---
I only want to transfer my save from 1 PSN ID account to another PSN ID account on the same console, not interested in changing platforms so I am curious if this would work then....
---
Did they make it?
---
True, we warlocks like style
---
I don't really use blink a whole lot anymore, I used to all the time in D1 and I've used it quite a bit in D2, once you get used to it you can judge exactly where you're going to land, I mainly use it in the crucible now, I stopped using it when my misjudgements killed me time and time again getting whisper back when you got it from the public event.
---
Dead meme format died long ago. Nek minet!
---
This comment gave me ptsd from pre-nerf novawarp
---
Some people just whip out Erentil of the gunfight and still manage to get the shot off before or as I kill them. The only how you beating someone with an Erentil in a gunfight is if they‚Äôre already almost dead or you land all headshots shots. Even with a handcannon, you‚Äôre only beating that charge time with a three tap, and you‚Äôre dead if they start charging before or as you land that first shot.
---
I used devour too for a bit but I honestly forget what it is I'm using now, I stopped playing for a bit then I started back a week before the solstice to get my wife and brother in to the game, I'm using the melee that makes enemies combust and using the Noba Bomb that splits up after impact.
---
I still leave every time.
---
TEAMWORK!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I think it does a little because with my mobility at 0 or 1 it's not that fantastic.
---
You suppose any of Calus' royal Cabal have seen his Minitool? ü§î
---
Yeah I‚Äôm using the Gambit Steel shader. I thought the hint of green goes with the blue glow.
---
i am sad that i cant play destiny 2 since some months, i miss everything of it :/
---
However it's a very good nightfall to try to get the 200k with due to the waves of trash. Mind you hollowed lair IS typically my least favorite, it was fairly easy to get my masterwork with.
---
I've never made a titan meme and i will probably never have to because bungie are doing it for us.

If you want any help with setups or advice, I don't mind helping you out. I help people through their 2-man shattered thrones and i've solo flawlessed the thing, so i'm definitely capable.

Be patient and take your time.  My original problem was me thinking I needed to one phase ogre and wizard.  I finished ogre with three rounds of wizards and had to go through two Psion waves before killing the knights.  I was able to get it done in 2 hours and 13 minutes.
---
I watched multiple videos of different strats for Hunter.  I landed on using Blast Furnace/Subtle Calamity/Sleeper Simulant with 3 round Golden Gun.  I switched to Celestial Nighthawk during Ogre.  
---
When I got to Dul Incarnu, I tried doing the Nightstalker and Legend of Acrius strat but it didn't work out well.  Switched to Perfect Paradox/Riskrunner/Hammerhead with Celestial Nighthawk and it was great. 
---
Riskrunner is a beast since every projectile being shot at you is Arc.  I was able to take down the Psions and the knights only using the Riskrunner.  I used Perfect Paradox since it was the only rapid fire shotgun I had for my Kinetic slot so I could get rid of the crystal quickly.
---
Once the knights were down, I hit Dul with Celestial and finished it off with my Hammerhead with Boss Spec.
---
Not sure if any of this helps but good luck!  I am not sure if I will ever get flawless solo but that is a headache for another time.
---
Begging is not allowed on the forums
---
Simply put, yes. Game is a lot better with forsaken and shadowkeep is looking great.
---
Gauntlets of molten magnetism.  I love it.
---
Alright god damn leave it alone get a life instead of worrying about a 14 yr old

The only reason that I‚Äôm not a big fan of EP is the the simple fact that blueberries tend to invade when your wanting to kill all the thrall and really in the end you would only get about half the kills that you were supposed to get
---
And it could damage enemies on the return flight.

"Not for me, not on my second life."

My Warlock: "I'm not interested in Toland's goals. They are not my own and Eris Morn had his journal, which was deceptively written. Never meet the author. He's rude."
---
My Titan: "Sorry, but I've got Crucible blueberries to take to the school of hard knockdowns."

Nice

Rocking the blue green background
---
true but idk y i just do better with the ace like for me the austringer has too much recoil but for the ace i dont find it as bad i do however mostly use precision frame hand cannons tho
---
Don‚Äôt come to crucible tomorrow
---
Oh lmao nah it was a genuine question I loved BoTW, was my first Zelda game I played
---
I like the idea. But, doesn't one of the tiitan melee's already give you your hammer back? I don't main titan. Sorry if it's a moot question
---
Well you said it couldn‚Äôt be done, when it can. Wether or not it‚Äôs legal or not is a different circumstance. I was merely saying your first post was false.

Ive recently moved in with my mother to save money before moving to Chicago to marry my fianc√©, so I work ALOT during the weeks and some weekends but I can usually find a few hours in the evenings to game when I'm not skyping with my girl. On my days off I came all day long haha

Side not, after living alone for 5 years moving in with a parent is so awkward lmfao
---
K&amp;M. I've been a console gamer most of my life and only switched to pc around 2017. I like controllers for third person action adventure games but it feels so weird to me now with fps'. I recently visited d1 on my ps4 for the first time in years and it was a very strange and nostalgic experience using controller.
---
There should be an exotic that after sprinting you should be able to throw your hammer and do chain lightning like Thor.

Allergic to Peanut butter

Hard pass

A sweat fest once in a while is fine. I'm mainly a pve player, but will grind out PvP also.
---
I'm fairly casual and laid back, so I usually don't let the sweat get to me.

how do you know he even plays on pc?

I think it's okay, there are just tons of things that people like more.

Gonna try with 7 resilence trying to max recovery

Ty ty!

I hate that dreaming city strike I die and nobody is around to revive me so many portals

Glimmer comes in fast and nonstop during normal play. I‚Äôm constantly offloading glimmer to Spider for resources when I‚Äôm near 100k.
---
PS4 version has the biggest player base/community.
---
Oh ok. Last question, and thank you for helping me out btw, is the ace of spade‚Äòs like one of the best hand cannons?
---
&gt;How have a lied? 
---
&gt;&gt;I haven't been on since first 2 weeks of forsaken
---
&gt;&gt;I played 6 months ago
---
&gt;&gt;I finished it the first day, left with nothing to do
---
&gt;&gt;I completed EVERYTHING from forsaken completely within the first 3 days
---
Also the first raid for forsaken didn't even  launch until 10 days after release so we know you really did not complete everything even without looking up your account. You're confusing your opinion of the xpac (which is 100% fair to think forsaken isn't worth $40) with the truth about what it has to offer and the estimated timeline to complete it. Also to be very fair, forsaken is not the same as it was 3 days after launch.
---
Yes, yes it's perfect
---
Next do the Mountaintop before the quest gets easier, I dare you ;)
---
Don't
---
I played the rest of that month of release, I know. You saw when I last played
---
Many people think that it is, both for pvp and pve, but I'm not a hand cannon person so I couldn't say.
---
I'm a solo player and still have lots of fun. I don't have 42000 hrs to kill either. There is lots of story to do on your own. Join us!
---
IMHO it wasn‚Äôt that bad
---
That's what I've heard. But the pc community seems loyal and growing from what I've heard. Also.. The game runs and feels 100x better on pc so far haha
---
Lol I'm 29.
---
You literally can‚Äôt post anything be it critique, analysis, a meme or ANYTHING without hearing a Hunter/warlock bring up OEM striker. You all see it as a meme or some shit but fuck, shit gets old bro. You act like titans are at fault, we‚Äôre not sorry for using the best build out there. Why would anyone handicap themselves? 
---
Bracing for the downvotes in a hunter and warlock dominated subreddit
---
Instill wear my Hunter Days of Iron set whenever I log in. 
---
I‚Äôm on FIRE.
---
LoW ain‚Äôt broken, it‚Äôs not bad but it ain‚Äôt a must pick. any more.
---
But you know what is? Erentil/wizened, energy shot guns, or energy snipers. All of which can be paired with ace.
---
Warlocks are beastly for room clearing and can play support for bosses the best of all three roles 
---
For rooms just put on karestine armlets and bottom tree arc and bang and for bosses well and Luna‚Äôs and all of the sudden your only useless in crucible
---
So now you're saying there was about a month's content then?
---
As a Titan, it is.
---
Is lasertag when Prometheus lens was op?
---
You on ps4? I'll help you out - I'm going to finish my 2nd set tonight!

Just here to say I was the 420th upvote.

best advice ever lol
---
thanks
---
Im super jealous
---
Somebody still is doing the story somewhere
---
Accept that it was a connection issue and don‚Äôt jump straight to DDoS because you got disconnected :) 
---
Everything connected to your router and the router itself would be disabled if you‚Äôd been DDoS‚Äôd
---
I find that less irritating than 50 bounties - more tedious, I agree but bounties feel like they take forever!
---
Hey that's fuckin OP. I'd like that. Perhaps with only the last two modes though for balancing issues
---
Final blows on eaz with a solar subclass equipped.
---
Nope.
---
I saw this and thought
---
‚ÄúYou poor soul‚Äù
---
Countdown in comp, healing nade, survival in comp also
---
Yeah it helped finished the GL kills, got my MB to roll with spike grenades and maxed out velocity, it's a dream.
---
What is this great video player on this sub and why do I never see it in the other destiny sub? It works soo wel
---
Why do you say that?
---
Yeah, I just wanna make an attempt and be able to say I did it.
---
It‚Äôs still a thing whenever I forget to put my disk in it asks me if I want to use my trial
---
Holy, I need to check that out.
---
For any Hand cannon discussion it's important to note that hand cannons are very different depending on whether you're on console or PC.
---
I just use xbox capture
---
It was so sad
---
It matters cuz 
---
***L O R E***
---
Video is cool aside the fact he uses top aim assist snipers and the ones that are not he hits bodies and some seventh columns are against people shooting literally standing still and using bows. Other than that bruh this editing is super dramatic! In a good way of course.
---
Scorch cannons, double jump, and a class ability. No supers, grenades, melee, or other guns.
---
Everything in that room deals arc and risk runner provides arc resistance when arc damage is taken, best way to stay alive.
---
Yes, true. I main XB
---
Hope for a lucky drop if not finish the forsaken DLC
---
I believe you can. Only ones available though are likely random drops. Play enough and you should get one. I wouldn't focus on it though. Bows aren't very good atm.
---
I mean we have confirmed it‚Äôs not 165gb update, that‚Äôs the whole game up to the point.
---
Actually Year 1 Armor is left behind because it can't roll squat for perks, no ammo finders, loaders, targeters. Much of Year 2 armor is as ugly as a drowned rat, though.
---
When Xur sells it it has random rolls doesn't it?
---
Get lucky from a legendary engram i believe thats it
---
Shadowkeep does not come with forsaken. I imagine a forsaken purchase option will appear on steam at some point, however at the moment you will have to buy forsaken from Battle.net and shadowkeep from steam.
---
Nah and I tried but no luck
---
Here I added [‚Äúsome‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/user/gumi-01-11/comments/cp1wjm/knights/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

Haven‚Äôt played much over the summer actually, maybe shadowkeep will get me back into it
---
Yeah the curated are the ones with the masterwork already done I believe.
---
To be able to get the set
---
You can already change the barrel perk and grip perk of a gun
---
Just did this for sunshot and the weapon detonations chained the exact same way, so satisfying.
---
To this picture? Or what it‚Äôs referencing?
---
nah I was just like " I want the source of that D2 porn"
---
Same
---
9.5/10 something for everyone
---
What happened after this picture was taken was too graphic to record.
---
Indeed
---
Go away mutant
---
Sam is a hunter/warlock and Frodo is a titan 
---
Change my mind
---
That PvP armor set was my absolute favorite and I'm still very pissed it never got pulled into Y2. No offense to the art team but, the Y2 set we got is HIDEOUS!
---
Don‚Äôt do it. Lol.    I‚Äôm kidding.
---
What are y‚Äôall on about? It doesn‚Äôt expire it gives you the content listed and that‚Äôs it
---
yeah I can imagine that... there's even an one-eyed mask
---
They are, im a warlock main, but honestly playing titan is like 20x times easier, still no proper nerf to OEM and striker
---
Spectral blades are not that op, my friend even hates them, he is hunter main
---
Yeah they def should only be able to shoot for X amount of time then have to stop
---
i don't wanna be the "the old days were better!" guy but the pve is not that spectacular, it just has that tiny bit of challenge where you feel accomplished when you finish stuff, and since you finish a lot of stuff in so little time you think you're good and you feel good. getting to max light is kind of a joke tbh and the raids take way less coordination and teamwork than they did in D1.
---
sorry about the rant, i'm addicted to the game too don't worry.
---
The packages drop from the chests at the end of EAZ.
---
must be great to have friends who play games like destiny2 with you.
---
all my friends play is fkin mobiles or leage of legends
---
Use tether for that part, you can shotgun down the knights immediately if it's something like threat level with surrounded, and then use a good power weapon to kill the boss- I use Whisper, it kills in 9 box breathing headshots
---
You on PC, PS4, or Xbox? I know on PC there's an LFG on discord!
---
1. Super mods
---
2. Never lone wolf while in a match. Always be with one other player and abuse teamshots.
---
3. Use the meta. Its meta for a reason.
---
4. If you feel yourself getting tilted, take a break. You won't win matches using your irrational brain.
---
5. If you are trying to do pinnacle quests, get the objectives done in the lower ranks.
---
The pass gives you the three seasons it advertises and then ends, Shadowkeep is a separate expansion and there'll be a new annual pass next year
---
I'd say Sam is more Warlock/Titan. I mean, he did carry Frodo LOL.
---
Oof. I‚Äôm sorry for your loss, man. What light is it? Might have to get some of my friends together and try this. Seems fun.
---
Guys help me out here with few doubts I have.
---
1) When will Destiny 2 be f2p
---
2) It is now showing 60$ for Forsaken collection. Will the price drop after it goes F2P?
---
3) Does the game have enough PVE content like Division 2? Also is there matchmaking for PVE?
---
Ah that would be cool tbh
---
Happy cake day
---
Yes! Hopefully it‚Äôs everything they‚Äôre promising! Also can‚Äôt wait for all the holiday events! üòä
---
Ah yeah it would be, oof
---
Mara intended the whole time to die, because she secretly wished for a throne world from Riven (same thing as Oryx‚Äôs throne world where you can‚Äôt die unless you die in YOUR throne world). The ‚Äúthis was all part of the plan‚Äù after she dies in the taken king trailer is her referring to Eris Morne who knows the plan, and Mara entrusted Eris to gather guardians, slay Oryx, and basically save her ass. So, basically she juked the fuck out of Oryx.
---
The Halloween event ‚ò†Ô∏è spooktober is sooo close. Whatcha play on?
---
Nope, just blinds. Doesn't prevent them from using abilities.
---
Appreciated
---
Ah cool I never played D1 so thanks
---
they responded to the post i made with:  Appreciate you posting about this issue. We're aware that this is occurring and we're currently investigating.
---
I can't seem to get a 200k run, highest i got was 147k, im trying to get militias birthright
---
Cool, I‚Äôm glad they have acknowledge the issue!
---
I feel ya all my friends up and left destiny back in year 1 it's been a solo acted for me since
---
same! at least i can relax knowing they are aware of it and that im not alone lol
---
Lol why is there three of this post?
---
Yea Ive heard you can get bounties from Werner but it doesn‚Äôt show up for me
---
So I have a theory about this after getting into the lore recently. 
---
Mara sacrificed herself on purpose to take oryx's throne. 
---
The throne was accessed on the MOON.
---
She is also quite upset about us killing her brother.
---
What if Mara is the big bad in shadowkeep? 
---
The taken corruption was too much for her to handle.
---
Hip fire grip
---
"draw me like one of your Cabal girls"
---
Moon's haunted
---
Y2 Butt towel was good tho. Y 1 chest, arms, legs, and head were better.
---
Oh dude I definitely get you there. Most of my irl friends left the game a long time ago...
---
That cracked me up dude. Took me forever to respond as I‚Äôm not on reddit much but once you find a solid team who as The Rock said ‚ÄòKnow Your Role‚Äô and it can actually be quite enjoyable.
---
Oh man, who's gonna break the news to Calus'?

Uncle drifter is safe right? Don't scare me fellow guardian

Year 1 pvp chest. Year 1 Ikora or solstice shoulders. Halloween shax mask
---
I‚Äôm about three weeks away from starting college.
---
Why here? Why now?
---
Get down Mr.President
---
That's cool and all but that's not really a real explanation. I'm looking for something in relation to balance in the Crucible
---
I‚Äôm talking about molecules around since they used emojis
---
I agree with you on delirium but with loaded question I think that it's pretty good because of its perk is just firefly where you don't have to get a headshot.
---
Go to your collections or something you can recreate it. Why wouldn't you just Google it?
---
Take everything you get from eververse and dismantle it. This way you have as much dust as possible before october
---
The fact he still got 22 kills. Still shows that he may be good but yet when against a team he may suffer on his play style, I was like that on D1. Was in a bunch of scrim teams but I was solo pushing and got kicked out of them all. So gg on the win, but never under estimate your opponent... idk what I‚Äôm saying GG on the win
---
See what you can achieve when we stop fighting amongst ourselves... We get tons of good content to bash through! More of this please!
---
Tried that, didn‚Äôt get any specific answers. I‚Äôve recreated the renewed (blue) version through collections and done the challenges but I can‚Äôt seem to upgrade just the vest alone. Wondering if it would require me to complete the challenges for all the pieces of armour again or not
---
Get some tegaderm from Walgreens and put it over it and then take it off in a week it skips the itching and healing process just make sure to clean it beforehand
---
Well apparently they‚Äôre supposed to be introducing actual phycological horror aspects and as a horror fanatic, I‚Äôm really hoping they pull it off.
---
with the cluster bombs and rivens curse it one shot the crystals, so it was the best way for me to take them out
---
Wait for a D3 tat
---
Because if it didnt one hit kill it would be unusable, because whoever you charged into would shotgun you, shoot melee you, or do anything else before your animation ended and you are able to do anything back. 
---
Its high risk and high reward.
---
Oh! Gotcha!
---
Yeah but we‚Äôll never get it back because risk runner exists. Just like we‚Äôll never have red death back because of that piece of shit crimson
---
Ill play tonight to confirm where
---
Doesn‚Äôt it need to be able to breathe?
---
Also.  Fighting lion is good with lunafaction.  If you know how to bank nades off of walls you can pretty much control any major lane.  Just gotta be careful about getting sniped.
---
So just ult from the start and clear them out real quick?
---
What rarity was it? You can get majestic stuff from the EAZ chests.
---
I'd say the only reason people are getting it is for mountain top. But if you get spike grenades or proximity grenades it's pretty decent.
---
Yes and no. With each bounty your synthesizer level will increase yes, but to recieve a tier 3 helmet, you will need to do *the same one* three weeks in a row.
---
Ohh damn that sounds amazing and nice to find another horror fanatic! I'm also looking forward to the raid, I'm planning to take part in the first raid run. Been preparing materials and my arsenal for it.
---
Skip
---
Maybe the Moon....
---
I believe the engrams from rahool can drop it? I‚Äôm not sure
---
Likely due to temporary connection issues or you're using it too early and from too far away. I mean, you're not trying to shoulder charge supers are you? lol
---
I'm a little confused about your question. Of course there are Titan mains.
---
Or just keep melee dodge over and over to clear because with wormhusk crown it'll heal you whenever you dodge
---
I believe 750. Forsaken and shadowkeep Locations will be free but the content isn't.  (Raid, dungeon, story mission etc.)
---
What do you use to make these. Is there a news template or something
---
Oh crap ya got me
---
