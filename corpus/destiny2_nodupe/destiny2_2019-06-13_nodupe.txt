It's ok, not a big user of bows as I suck with them. Wishender has a long charge time so find it difficult to use. My favourite bow is Trinity Ghoul
---
---
---
My man
---
Included with a purchase from bungie store
---
That‚Äôs the literal point of taken ogres
---
Not comp thankfully but in the weekly playlist and rumble yeah
---
cursed_instruction
---
I‚Äôve yet to see afkers in comp. this was in showdown. But the point still stands
---
Yep
---
Bungie should remove you simple fucks that can't kill an ogre .
---
He shoot,  
---
He boop,  
---
but most importantly,   
---
***HE WENT SPACE GAMBLING WITH VUVUZELA AND HE'S NOT COMING BACC!***
---
Exactly, a lot people were saying that "oooooo Ghaul is coming back" and then saying "maybe we can get Cayde back too?" I saw a few posts like this yesterday and I felt like saying the reason we won't get Cayde back is for players that don't have Forsaken, since it isn't required to play Shadowkeep, (It wouldn't make sense to those new to the series or have lived under a rock to avoid spoliers) I REALLY felt like telling them the reason but I don't want to break there hearts with Cayde shapped holes.
---
I *would* finish the quest...if I could get a fucking Corsair down to drop
---
Unfortunately yes
---
Yep. I usually go HuckB just to kill lots of thralls/acolytes/dregs, etc, but bows like LeMonarque can be used to clear ads with their AoE
---
XqC plays D2?
---
It's important to note that Power Level is not the only controlling factor. Some events, including that Arms Dealer strike, are "Prestige" activities, which means that your Power Level will be restricted to the level of the activity. That is to say, on the 300PL Arms Dealer, like on Whisper, or Zero Hour, or raids, being higher than recommended power doesn't make the activity any easier.
---

---
The other thing is to know which activities are meant / recommended for groups. That strike is basically nightfall difficulty, which, while certainly *doable* solo, are meant for a full fireteam. You're struggling in large part because you're doing a challenging, group-targeted mission without a group.
---
So, while the other guy who responded is correct that you can do the power surges to up your light, and get into some Black Armory forges to build better meta weapons, the quickest and easiest solution to the difficulty is to find some people to play with either via friends, a clan, or the LFG app.
---
Thanks
---
Ya on ps4? I can get you through it twice np, got some friends that gotta do it anyway.
---
No HS required, just gotta follow the route.
---
Edit: typo
---
The new titan lets can one hit a super sooooo I think that pretty good...
---
Check postmaster. This worked for my friend
---
Even worse are the servitors that teleport *you*.
---
Cause it's part of the story to show that she really is gone? And she just didn't leave her little throne world for like a few days? Like I can't roll my eyes any harder. 
---
The OP commented as to why they don't know why it's happening you called it lazyness. I mean it could be like WoW where you just redo the raid cause reasons. 
---
In destiny you are redoing the dreaming city because of the narrative. They at least had the foresight and creativity to build in a reason.
---
Look here.

---
Got mine on first drop plugging in the runes they list.
---
Christ, can you imagine if you had to get Crucible rocket launcher kills for the quest?
---
I'm still fairly new to the game and don't quite get what this means can someone explain how to make a public event heroic?
---
[deleted]
---
Credit u/Tobess_ for the format
---
Filthy good legs if you can close the gap soon enough, definitely agree. The titans and warlocks got the good exotics and I guess it‚Äôs the hunters who bungies gonna shaft this season. Just my opinion though.
---
A thanos snap to a guardian.
---
The base game has now had 6 expansions, bundled as in 2, 1, and 3
---
The first two are Osiris and Warmind.
---
These both contain a Raid lair for leviathan.
---
A quick campaign
---
And some end game grinds
---
These two are bought together
---
Forsaken is the solo expansion.
---
Kicking off year two, Forsaken has the most content.
---
A cool story mode
---
An amazing raid
---
The best matiral sources and powerful gear. 
---
Also it's my personal fav DLC
---
Forsaken is the only Dlc required for the next September expansion
---
The year two content pack contains, Black Armory, Jokers Wild, and Penumbra. 
---
This is two quick, but cool, raids. The forges, Gambit Prime, The reckoning, and Menagerie. As well some other grinds. 
---
Personally, I have enjoyed all of the above content, but to play RN, Osiris is self contained, Warmind is cool enough, Forsaken is a must, and the others are cool, but definitely optional.
---
PS4?
---
They are addressing this bug it'll probably be fixed by reset
---
No problem :)
---
Pc, sorry
---
For PVE, that's a pretty good roll. I also run a No Distractions+Fourth Times the Charm for PVE and that one is basically a baby Whisper of the Worm. Good DPS :)
---
Go do other activities... Like it says to do... You have to do other things to rank up. Just like every single video game with a ranking system
---
No worries. Enjoy the better gunplay and graphics.
---
I saw Bungie had a deal for Forsaken the complete edition for like 30+ dollars. Would that be a good investment then?
---
This is a tough combo to put up with
---
It's gonna take me much longer to get to 750
---
Wait till he realizes that the cap is 750 now
---
Still, better than regular.
---
Part of the mystery is unraveling that very question. The leading and best supported theory is a bit...longer than that. It is also much, much more interesting. 
---
It‚Äôs on /r/destinylore if you‚Äôre interested. It‚Äôs quite the read, but very compelling and evidenced.
---
It‚Äôs cool, I got you lol
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt really use it because it‚Äôs not my highest power sniper. But even for crucible, it‚Äôs just a well balanced sniper. Even without crucible perks.
---
I‚Äôm on pc
---
And we were lucky enough to get repeated the map of killing 50 mobs with rocketlauncher. That way, we skipped the Nightfall x3 + 60 rocketlauncher kills step.
---
When is the reset
---
Thank you
---
WAT!? *Goes to cry in the corner*
---
Yea it‚Äôs a little fucked but it‚Äôs true
---
Annual Pass. 
---
And yes, that's generally how it works. You can still keep playing all your old shit tho but new stuff costs extra. 
---
Good Luck.
---
I almost always prefer Lunafactions over Phoenix Protocol. Especially in this instance where you're using it to burn the boss, not kill a bunch of adds. Phoenix Protocol is sort of wasted in this particular encounter.
---
Okie dokie so I‚Äôll dismantle it
---
That's totally fair. I was thinking more about the people that hit max light on day 1 and then complain until the next content release.
---
thanks for the reply
---
thanks for the answer
---
The Annual Pass is $17 right now instead of the usual $35.
---
Dirty snipes! Very nice! I‚Äôd be salty AF lol
---
New one doesnt included forsaken. They'll probably do a bundle deal.
---
Each event has a harder "heroic"  version which usually comes with an alternate boss or objective. In turn they have slightly better rewards and fulfill certain quests or pursuits. Each event has a different way to trigger its heroic version, but there are guides here for each one.
---
For example, in the events where you fight the giant servitor, three smaller servitors will spawn and shield the big one. If you kill all three before they disappear then the boss becomes more resistant and harder to kill.
---
It's all I run now. That and top tree Sunbreaker.
---
Actually had a match today against an invader with truth today. It was awful.
---
Well if you can't back up your words man...
---
Yes
---
find a scorn public event, first scorn i killed in it gave me itüòÇ
---
I too hate it when I have to play video game
---
I prefer to avoid the horde mode type stuff because I am not the most competent with my GL aim. Chances are that would've lost me more progress on my points from dying.
---
I got a ton of good stuff(thunderlord, coldheart, etc) on my pc account and the complete collection (with year 1 stuff, forsaken, and annual pass stuff) is on sale for 40 bucks, so I‚Äôll transfer my battle.net account to steam, buy shadowkeep, and continue as usual
---
As I answered to someone else I prefer to avoid the horde mode type stuff because I am not the most competent with my GL aim. Chances are that would've lost me more progress on my points from dying. If you're competent, yes, those would be faster.
---
Ahaha good point
---
Yeah, safest bet
---
"Fucking Jotunn"
---
Seriously, how has that not been nerfed yet
---
r/whooosh you filthy casual

WWWWHATS UP GUYSSS DICK.. FAT LIPS HERE AND WEEELCOME TO ANOTHER GUIDE WHERE I MISPRONOUNCE RUNES INTO RUINS. NOW I KNOW YOU ALL ARE WONDERING HOW TO GET THE BEST RUINS FROM MENAGERIE.. WELL IM HERE TO TELL YOU IN THIS QUICK 12 MINUTE VIDEO. BUT BEFORE WE START, LETS GET INTO IT BY STARTING OFF WITH A GIVEAWAY OF 5 MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE BACK. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SUPPORTING ME AND *here‚Äôs some tiny bit of useful content*

‚ÄúCalus demands you fight worthier opponents‚Äù is going to become the next ‚ÄúDEATH HEALS PRIMEVAL‚Äù
---
I almost got to the boss but I figured I would just get pounded by him for another 40 trys so I just gave up and followed the above post.  The part with 2 tanks was making me want to shotput my PC from second floor window lol.  Thanks for reply.
---
Thank you for the detail.  It did remind me of a nitefall.  Everything you say makes sense.  I did the quest to get the 690 armor and for some reason I got all pieces except the waist piece or bond for warlock so im only 675 power.  I guess I have to farm just a bit to get 690.  Thanks again for taking the time to help me out.
---
Bungie demands you fight worthier opponents.
---
Finding a gun that isn't a grind is an extremely rare sight in this game, you're better off just putting in the grind (Sometimes it's actually a pretty fun thing to do) But the Wish Ender bow from Shattered Throne isn't a grind at all, rather a secret mission. What platform are you on?
---
What?
---
I would pay stupid amounts of money for an airsoft 3 burst with this shell...
---
Rune Farmers.
---
[removed]
---
You are very welcome!
---
Norfleet In Destiny? (Holy shit that would be fucking insane)
---
Me and the boys at guardian con. Damn
---
Le monarque haven‚Äôt gotten yet but does some serious damage on me so would like to try it out
---
Is it cuz the game was free at one point, or are you still wondering who the fuck Ms 5000 Watt is?
---
There so gay
---
I have forever respect for Warframe. Never played it, never will, its art style is gross, but FUCK does its gameplay and RPG stuff look fun. Theres a "top hat" magic guy you can play that literally teleports into his own throne world, and can drag enemies there with him. So sick.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
and eh, borderlands. The guns are interesting, and i heard the writing is good. Only cell shaded graphics i care for was Wind Waker
---
LMFAO
---
When you think of a meme but can‚Äôt be bothered making it properly. ‚Äú5 notes.‚Äù
---
Morgoth man...
---
Check the postmaster. If you still can‚Äôt progress trying completing the quest on another character.
---
Which us exactly qhy they are the best to drop on the enemy
---
Taken are the worst enemies change my mind
---
Better get your tickets
---
I think it is under activity in flair (I could be wrong)
---
Well then go play them, we could do without the tantrums.
---
Already bought em boys. Guardian con here we come!!
---
I doubt that I will make it that far before destiny is a long forgotten game series but I might try it one day
---
Because epic games store isnt that good. With epic games having been breached before. Also with epics exclusive practice. Its like forcing console practice to our platform where we didnt get bait and switched by game devs moving to epic instead of steam
---
You have a higher chance of not getting a blue
---
I'm having serious trouble at 715, especially after he demands worthier opponents two or three times. I just die in one or two hits, and I literally can't partake in some portions of the mission like the stab the knight/ogre part of riposte because they one-shot me. What's your loadout like?
---
Hey! You got what you asked for!
---
Heh, I suppose so.
---
This is also my (sad, sad) life.
---
I've seriously contemplated so many tattoos for Destiny lol. I'm not sure what I want though, after 4,000+ hours in Destiny as a whole its hard to pick just one symbol/scene.
---
Lmao
---
You know you could of banked instead of throwing the match equally as hard as he did.
---
Lenz, a bow that shoots explosive ice arrows, for d2
---
Give it more loot and less lootboxes.
---
Limbo, also known as Warframe DIO
---
This reminds me of the borderlands easter egg on titan when you come across one of the scans.
---
Sad to admit I‚Äôve done exactly that before to save the motes. The rest of my team promptly got wiped by a golden gun like a second later
---
Me currently without any clan or person to play with on PC
---
not at all.  anytime i have ever went into crucible with 6 people, the other team wouldnt stand any sort of chance. it cant ever be any amount of fun for people on the receiving end of it.
---
Keep trying
---
It's worth it
---
"I fucking suck!"
---
Nerf Shards of Galanor, it literally gives you super energy back for using a panic super. It's literally the most broken exotic right now. Please Bungie, fix this crutch exotic. I'm tired of getting Blade Barraged all game long.
---
Superb! Thank you for bringing Destiny 2 to real life!
---
I have been hanging back in strikes for anyone with GLs so they can get kills (already have Wendigo). Last night I MM with one guy who didn't have Fighting Lion and was trying to get kills with that legendary Y1 GL and he was terrible with it, I felt so bad for the guy, it's gunna take him a year to get Wendigo at his rate, lol.
---
Oh trust me, mine's a powerhouse. Especially against anything neutral or weak to radiation damage. Hell, any of my three rivens would be a decent help.
---
I was in Gambit last night and almost every Invader is using this!
---
They‚Äôll get there eventually. It‚Äôs not a terrible start, but all they have is a start.
---
Replace "740 Recommended Light Level" to Blackout and you got yourself a bisected Guardian.
---
1st group on lfg and only took about 3-4 hours in Blind well üòÅ
---
When that happens I just put the guns away, bust out The Insurmountable Skullfort, and fire up the pain train.
---
Ikr I've calculated that I'll have to run a lost sector another 35 times to get this damn grenade launcher
---
"rez me, rez me" or "revive dude?"
---
Wait what?
---
But doesnt a lower ilvl weapon affect your overall ilvl? Why would i keep ilvl 200 weapons to use at 690? Thats what im confused about, wont i always find a better version until im at that level?
---
My 2 cents, Most decent gaming mouses have 2 side buttons for your thumb i always in any game bind one of those to melee and the other one to whatever i feel like works ingame in destiny i use the other button for my class ability. That and grenade is rebinded on g and super is on q, Works for me and feels weird if i change it haha
---
Don't worry if you are stuck trying to get it. The Truth shall set you free.
---
Interesting. I‚Äôll try that out!
---
You can always infuse.
---
Just got jotunn too, the stars have aligned
---
They haven't touched the rest of pinnacles yet so
---
Vault Hunter: "Easy, just put money in a slot machine."
---
Guardian: "We used to stand outside a cave and chuck grenades in it for loot, but people hated fun so it went away."
---
Tenno: "You people are fucking weird."
---
Try comp right now. Every time I get to 2000 I get stomped by a 4 stack of try hards as a solo player. Life is suffering
---
Same I haven‚Äôt even done a single raid im steadily trying to get back into it
---
You can boost the power of your weapons and armor
---
Apparently a substitute for outbreak is huckleberry for the ads
---
I want to so bad but I cant afford it works been bad the last few weeks. Dump a mag for me
---
Criminal scum
---
Comp
---
Thx
---
:D
---
About $300
---
Litteraly, everything went to shit 10 second later
---
We can do it
---
Hell yeah bro. My tattoo was done perfectly. It was a toss up between the tattoo you gave and the ace of spades. The Nathan Fillion lover in me had to get Ace though.
---
I really hope not.
---
You can get it)
---
Commented :)
---
Can get it)
---
The only reason my Outbreak will never be masterworked :(
---
Well jokes on you i'm still using a scout _AND_ Truth
---
I got u bro did u sub?
---
Is that the ornament?
---
Drifter: First time?
---
Tsk, even moar rewards?
---
even writing in chat ''don't kill the boss, wanna do heroic''. they just ignore you and kill it with grenade launchers and i'm just like stood there in utter disbelief as they scramble to the chest thinking they've won the lottery. :/ Even worse when doing heroic is part of a quest step. :/
---
Same
---
Vex themed images?
---
No we all just picked different shaders lol
---
Ah right, thanks for the reply
---
loved it bro left you a sub and like
---
Np
---
Gosh boy do I love starting strikes only to find myself loaded into blind well somehow, oh and the fuckers sitting in it return to orbit afterwards. Sick playlist.
---
Yeah even if i don't have a reason to do it, still would rather it be somewhat worth my time.
---
Have you done the step that requires you to do the 3 lost sectors?
---
Thanks for the reply and the offer! Sadly I play on PC.
---
they should just release ornaments for armor that can be applied to any piece, kind of like the way shaders work - only it applies to the full set. That way you can mix and match armor pieces with the right perks etc. and then just apply the skin over the top to hide the ugliness.
---
From BL2: Give the Unkempt Harold. For D2, allow it to be Exotic and have its variant drops. I want me my explosive fan of explosives. 
---
From D2: Either the Recluse, Vex Mythoclast, or Gjallahorn. Might lean for the Gjallahorn.
---
I already did the quest and talked to her. Still wont open
---
Exactly. I use it in pve, but not in pvp. Prefer handcannon + shotgun in pvp.
---
Because we're a clan and we're all friends and when we're six we want to be able to play together?
---
The trials of the 9 circles look cool
---
Six shooter golden gun is pretty good in PvP. 
---
Ming it easier to shutdown compared to something like Titan hammers is simply because the actual super is easier to use (no arc/dip and its instant so you don‚Äôt have to lead a target). 
---
Blade barrage is also still pretty solid, I use it regularly with shards. It‚Äôs also easily the best super for blind well or mayhem.
---
Edit: missed the typos, SoO &amp; beat, not beast.
---
No
---
Worldline Zero would be pretty cool in Warframe, with the catalyst obviously. It'd be pretty cool if it carried momentum like it does in D2 as well, so we could have some shenanigans with 4th abilities and teleports.
---
Lmao, imagine doing all of those things to get a gun. And don‚Äôt act like you didn‚Äôt do it too
---
Listen you guys, we want to play together. We won't give up having fun as a clan because you are salty you lost a crucible match. Let people enjoy things. This is quick, some people (like me) have no interest in playing comp (where you can't blame 4 stacks for wanting to win, btw). 
---
You all are salty as hell, and want to believe they are the salty ones.
---
No knowledge to say what should be given for warframe maybe? I'd love to throw my hat in for the game, but I don't know what should be given for the game.
---
This is a problem... When lvl 50s tear the boss down.
---
Some are trying to get quest steps done.
---
I don't blame the lower level guys.
---
I mean. Your compensation is that you have been able to play the game for a year. Like there is no need to compensate. It's not like people haven't got their money's worth?
---
Really?
---
‚ÄúGrind‚Äù yeah.
---
King‚Äôs Fall armor was always my favorite from D1! When I cosplayed my Hunter last year, that‚Äôs the armor I chose to make and it was a lot of fun to build.
---
You get it from the spider or petra after beating the main storyline. Try that I'd say :)
---
Make This template mainstream
---
Not really worth it anymore. And it was never worth it for boss DPS
---
Yeah man! I just checked battle.net, Xbox,and the PS Store. All three are on sale for $15 USD currently. That‚Äôs is of course assuming you have forsaken already, if not that has been dropped to $40 and comes with the annual pass in it.
---
Do you know if that‚Äôs the case for console (just Incase you don‚Äôt play on console)?
---
it's just funny because it's like he's saying "fuck this, I'm out!"  XD
---
I agree, the age of the expression goes back to who knows when...
---
a reflection on mortality more than death 
---
It was one of those moments that creates connection between the things we enjoy 
---
The book and the game now have mental connection in my mind...
---
Have a great day !!
---
I've heard its nowhere near what it was in D1
---
Nah, it's not as good as it was in D1 unfortunately. It's a bit disappointing
---
Ya, search for Annual Pass on your platform of choice üòõ
---
Why is destiny 1 armor so cool compared to destiny 2?
---
Dope! Thank you so much for feeling me, man!
---
I Will frick you üò§üò§üò§
---
It has gotten 1000x better than it was at launch. Plus it looks like shadow keep is going to completely change it again for the better. If your on pc ill play with ya.
---
The gun is definitely worth it.  Don't use Wendigo for it though.  Wendigo is not worth it in PvP.
---
No problem, enjoy! There some really great content on there, especially this season.
---
My hubby and my clan think I'm insane for finding so many things in Destiny cute, "It's just not a cute game" Danny says but you know what? Danny is dead wrong, Destiny is SUPER CUTE!
---
I would like to speak Cluster Bombs
---
I just got the game last week and I had no idea this was even a thing. 
---
The game does a terrible job with team/coop play and social interactions. I like the game a lot but it falls on it's face when it comes to this stuff. I literally know more about playing the game by randomly looking on reddit than from the actual gameplay/tutorials in the game.
---
$15.74...odd price lol
---
Is it f2p in 5 days?  I own the game but haven‚Äôt played ina while. Just wondering why 5 days?
---
Lol yeah Xbox was the only one that was oddly priced, the other two were 14.99, still a good price for those three dlcs though
---
It says it in the triumphs tab for the catalysts
---
Very true. Much better than the 34.99 original price
---
Ok but I've done 30 hours of forges and still don't know why they bounce off
---
Love this, you complain about people not making events heroic, first person that's asks how: "go search for it."
---
King's Fall armour set is my favourite as well. Never took off my Hunter's set after getting all the pieces
---
Thank you! :D
---
I was a little self-conscious after posting this because I've been grinding and just taking whatever armor raises my light. Gotta save those masterwork cores for my bow upgrades... üòÖ
---
Next high curse week I will be more than happy to.  Its low curse week right now so Shatterred Throne isn't available.  PM me your Gamertag I can help with other stuff as well.
---
Have you checked to see if they might be doing maintenance of any type?
---
brick and mortar shops/websites seem to have it, digital or cheaper hardcopy, i'm eyeing the same
---
Weber bounties are not account wide.
---
I just recently started using it because I had a nice little stockpile for some reason. Definitely a new favorite. :)
---
Any chance you haven't completed the primary Forsaken campaign on your warlock? I had a similar issue with my Titan and that was the problem.
---
Kind of reminds me of crazy glass armor for Skyrim...I could get aboard farming a set of that!
---
Link to the video?
---
Right now I would say darci because we dont have the izanagi catalyst and izanagi burns through ammo
---
&gt;Playing the Tangled Shore prisoner escape public event

---
&gt;I go for the cryo-orbs to freeze the boss
---
&gt;I grab the orb to freeze the boss
---
&gt;Boss is kill
---
&gt;RIP
---
I guess the incoming 2.5.0.3 patch is going to fix that :/
---
Social anxiety is a bitch you know?
---
It's better than the contant spam of "Moons haunted"
---
Whisper still has better over time damage, Darci has better single shot damage.
---
Yes. My friend can enter Destiny 2
---
Tell me she's still not saying that...
---
I can agree with you and the pricing of past DLCs. Like it was weird and scammy in how you have to paid for an entire annual pass. I can say that it was expensive and D2 Y1 was not worth my money. Regarding recycled content - I get your point; you wanna see something new, something exciting but all we got were Destiny 1 bosses and Ghaul + the Moon. But hey if someone does not wanna play these recycled content they just don't have to. They can skip the content and just wait till the next season as DLCs are basically a la carte now. No one is forcing someone to pay ¬£50 for Shadowkeep + Season Pass. 
---
Even if the pricing were to still be slightly expensive. I don't really see it as an issue - considering that Bungie is self publishing now, it's going to cost more to make the game and hence they have to charge more. This can already be seen in the situation of the Eververse store that you mentioned above; you open up the menu and see that almost everything is up for silver. 
---
Now regarding personal preferences, it really is up to someone to decide to see if the DLC is worth their time and money. For example, CoO and SoTD was not worth my money because I don't really like Gambit and the CoO endgame content. But I can say that the Forsaken DLC alone is worth my time and money because I enjoyed it; I liked the story line and it felt similar to Taken King.
---
Oh hate on him man. Can't stand his videos. The pacing of them is so slow... So slow. Way too much fluff. Look up pause reset play. He doesn't have the best audio, but guy gets straight to the point.
---
I knew this wasn't going to be the last time I saw this format
---
Holy hell, that's lucky! I've been farming for the Great Hunt set for awhile now and I still need the Greaves, I hope they don't have mobility though, that would suck.
---

Was the ‚Äúexecutioner‚Äù your enemies lining up and pretty much standing still?
---
This is why I never get all the exotic ghost shells. I either get another purple, or just a 150 Bright dust and three shaders.
---
I got the sparrow, shell, and 1k from my 3rd run üò∂

I‚Äôm already past that, I just gotta get like 30 more motes, then 25 guardian kills and a team wipe invasion

what the fuck did you just bring upon this cursed land

The city is near a mountain with a peak, and snow, but there‚Äôs no snow on the ground, cold enough for snow on the peak, but not on the ground, Rocky Mountains, also the Appalachian mountains are more curved near the top
---
Is it possible to request an Award from OP for such.....questionable content?
---
I personally think he gets too much shit considering his videos are completely optional to watch and datto/PRP/esoterickk provide faster alternatives and some people like the guide taking it slow
---
And considering brawler and singe boost the damage we could be talking about over maybe 60k with arc (don't know how much the singe and brawler boost each) and if it was solar singe over 80k
---
I hate this sub lol
---
LMFAO I almost pissed myself this is so true
---
I would if I knew I was going to get more time. I'm concerned that I may not be able to play much at the end of the season. But just have to see how that goes. 
---
I feel you on the new players. Several times playing with below level 20 players recently. And it's definitely aggravating I'm pretty much consistently coming in top 1 or 2 as well. I'm sorry it been bad for you too this season. I might have to start pretending I'm gambling, get a few wins. Stop. Get on next day. But even doing that a little has proven it really doesn't matter.

Thunderlord and hammerhead and queen breaker are missing
---
You and me both brother! What do you pair it with? I'm runnin pre forsaken Antiope-D and its still working wonders in the cruic
---
Source on the anime/episode/scene?
---
Nezarec + inaugural address with reload speed MW 
---
DISGUSTINGLY good.
---
It has the same shader as everything else.
---
Is It a bad thing that a youtuber wants to earn money? These days being a youtuber Is hard especially since the first adpocalypse happened and also YT Is his job.
---
Liars Handshake and its Cross Counter is Arc damage. even without an arc melee up.
---
And its x3 damage.  And it stacks with One Two Punch. AND also Combination Blow.
---
Thats okay damage.
---
Getting motes is easy enough without needing heavy ammo. Picking it up to shoot the primeval is fine, but everyone I know leaves the purple ammo box for the invader so they can load up their machine gun and destroy the other team more easily. If they get wrecked immediately after jumping through the portal by blade barrage of something, that's just really bad luck.
---
Huh guess it just looks brighter on mobile?
---
I know but I can't go get faction tokens for her. Or do things for her.  When I'm waiting for my fire team to go back to orbit sometimes I'll run down there and just sit in the big chairs.
---
I‚Äôm not saying it won‚Äôt, I‚Äôm just saying for arguments sake they didn‚Äôt technically confirm it. I‚Äôm that guy.
---
What the fuck even is this
---
It needs to die already.
---
who needs jesus?
---
It‚Äôs good for everything. It‚Äôs damage stacks higher with other teammates using it. It has little recoil also it looks and sounds amazing.
---
Lance would be really nice to have as well as a small damage buff to the vortex effect on the Nova bomb
---
I used to buy lately his videos contains no info what so ever.  Everything is secret, exotic, new etc. YouTube clickbaiting. Imo

I need a shower
---
Mountaintop + Spike Grenade + Boss Spec+ Luna/Rally = Fully automatic Jotun without charge time
---
I feel like it's stronger than IKELOS SG prenerf
---
On the other hand, there is no questions about what to do after you watched it.
---
If it‚Äôs hooked up to your lan server then sure. But this will most likely only work on the D1 crota raid
---
I mean yeah you can do this but why? Why would you do this, why would you do any of this?
---
image is 690 by 690, all I see is 69
---
I currently own all expansions in destiny 2 (base game, CoO, Warmind, forsaken and the annual pass) but am going to be switching to PC in about a month. What do I need to buy in order to play everything including shadowkeep and the next 4 seasons after that? And to my understanding I will keep the progress I've made on my xbox right?
---
Ok so how do i update my D2 to get D1 raids
---
nah solar burn and brawler the best!
---
In case you didn‚Äòt notice: he had to hand in all of his questions beforehand to get them approved by Bungie and to give them the opportunity to answer in the best way possible. He actually did mention it in a video on his yt channel.

---
I just want my hunter to have a Vex prosthetic leg again. I loved doing that to flex
---
I'm ashamed that I watched the whole thing, a little bit.
---
What? That‚Äòs what some armors looked like in D1? Wow!
---
Is this a r/woooosh kind of situation
---
Fuck me I‚Äôll have to watch this
---
thats not a bad idea. not to mention i can pick up the Wendigo bounty and kill 2 birds with one stone #worksmarternotharder
---
I have to use this shiester for mountaintop
---
Ty, restart worked. Does anyone knows what caused this? Was really worried for a second.
---
I just imagine some poor fallen playing on his gameboy, only to get hit with a random truth
---
*hugs hammerhead*
---
The hotfix had something to do with it
---
Just keep practicing and playing the game, you‚Äôll get better even if you don‚Äôt think you are
---
If you were a giant ogre and some scrub came up to you so close to your ankles that you cant eye-beam him into oblivion, would you not stomp him?
---
I've gotten so much crap from those engrams and not a single interesting drop.
---
i think i‚Äòll stay.
---
To be fair, there is a triumph for a team whipe without using heavy or super.
---

---
Fucking ptsd is coming back with all the hours I put into d1. I love it lol
---
27k. Lion Gang Rise Up
---
Lol been waiting to see this format in action
---
It's a trailer, found it randomly on YouTube. Not actual in game stuff.
---
Mountaintop is arguably the best weapon in the game
---
I feel like there's more agency involved in the Chalice than the frames, though that's not to say I didn't love the forge. I didn't love the AFKers in the forge though. Not \*YET\* seen any in Menagerie.
---
Other people in game popped the consumable
---
Or [this one](https://i.imgur.com/Tp5Ug79.jpg)
---
You're not outnumbered, you are harder to find and more mobile.
---
They on the other hand offer a target rich environment from which to pick your kills from.
---
Does it work like that? Cool I don‚Äôt know that thanks. Thought I was just super lucky for a min.
---
Did not say for people to go after him though i understand where you are coming from
---
It was countdown lol
---
I mean...these are all endgame armor sets, so if we're just comparing that, I'd say both games are going head to head. There are standouts like the y1 trials and y3 IB armor but in general, I'd say D2's endgame armorhas been great.
---
Grab the chest leave the are until you see the name of a new room in the bottom left, pop a new rune, go back to do the boss fight and the chest can be re looted
---
Excuse me?
---
Omg, I wondered why everyone hung around for the so long, ty man man
---
Modding halo 2 is what made me decide I wanted to work with computers. Pursuing my masters in CS now as well.
---
I thought I saw Starship Voyager at the top of the image.   Then I realized this is a picture of a screen and not a screenshot, and it's just a ceiling fan.
---
Exactly!!
---
genious
---
Couple it with a quick _boop_ and lost sector bosses go down in 1
---
You remember dothalo and the website a4h?
---
I'm dead
---
No, I cleared the last week's bounties, not this week :(
---
Nice!
---
It's really not. If people can complete a season long Pinnacle quest on the first day in a few hours, I'd say it's almost too low (although I definitely don't *want* it to be longer).
---
Ah yeah, now I remember. It's been a while since I watched it
---
Time for a re-watch!
---
^^^S2 ^^^where?
---
Ty!
---
I legitimately thought that was it. That‚Äôs what I was told and it worked for me. If it‚Äôs something else then let him know there‚Äôs no need to be pissed if someone else was misinformed but lucky.
---
no.
---
When I was grinding for Luna's Howl, I got all of the quest steps done solo along with most of the glory points and all I needed was fabled. 
---
I was stuck around 1400-1600 glory for about 2 weeks so I decided to get an LFG going. After many win and loss streaks I was finally at 2096 glory 4 hours later.
---
Me and my team were winning a countdown match 5-1 with 1 player left alive on the other team. I started to get a little cocky knowing I was 1 kill away from my beloved Luna's Howl and tried a 360 quick scope for the win. I sadly missed and died, that guardian followed that up with a team wipe nova bomb and his team ended up rolling over us with 5 straight rounds all undefeated.
---
After that point I went on a massive losing streak and went back down to 1400 glory. You could say I was emotionally and mentally drained. 
---
In the end, I got that damned Luna's Howl a month later, 5 days before the season was over and Black Armory dropped. 
---
Don't give up guardian, you've got this!
---
imagine being this much of a tard
---
This is the first one I've seen of this particular post, I think the "Karma Farm" they're referring to is just the whole "moon's haunted" schtick in general. No need to delete this post, and I'm glad to see that credit to the original is on there!
---
They‚Äôre busy having fun with the first 26 Grumps
---
I also ask myself that when I watch the re:zero trailer season 2
---
His voice grinds the fuck out of me. The way he speaks is so unnatural and he does this thing at the end of every sentence.
---
There is no way to sort it out. You have to re-grind those pieces.
---
&gt; On a serious note, WTF make them blue Bungie?
---
Nice, way to make your mistake someone elses problem. I knew they would be blue and made sure to lock them as soon as I got them. This really seems like it just on you for not paying attention.
---
Dopeness!
---
Do you have an Instagram I can follow? This is great
---
At least it has a S2 confirmed! ;-;
---
Yeah, if the stomp is a problem, thats the teams issue. I just ran it last night with 3 titans and a warlock (no tether) and we beat all 4 in a row, no wipes. 
---
You just gotta deal with them quick enough so that the stomp isn't an issue. THATS the challenge.
---
Oof 100
