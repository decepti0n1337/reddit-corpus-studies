I miss them too
---
---
---
I was quite stubborn doing the MT triumph, but with that speed shotgun wouldn't matter with only 2 shots. Telesto though might have been a much better idea. I switched to it later in the match.
---
Lmfao.... 6million dead is equal to 25 cents....seems legit
---
Now that area 51 has passed WE RAID THE GREAT PYRAMIDS OF EGPYT
---
Do it !
---
Poor man's anarchy :D
---
Idk why someone downvoted you. Thats just literally ehat happened
---
Once you own a shader it can be reacquired at any time, you gotta play the “dismantle game” for certain shaders in certain activities until you get access to the shader you want.
---
Do you have to wait for reset to get it?
---
Play the game
---
I've been using Tigersprite with Riskrunner forever now! On pc though. lol
---
Ra is the final boss... hes op af
---
I never made this about the 25 cents. I dont know why in the world you keep bringing that up. What i was complaining about is how absurd it is to charge 25 cents for a game at all, let alone one that is free. They dont make profit from those 25 cents. So why would they charge me 25 cents. And if youd have paid any atention at all youd habe realised that this is about them locking two thirds of the game behind a subscription service. If sou habe to pay 60€ a year to access 2/3 of the content of a free game, the game isnt free anymore.
---
Later we can eat at KFC
---
Haha.. Thats been my clan name for a while now...lol
---
its normal, you're supposed to play new light when you start up a new character
---
It will cycle around in the heroic story playlist and will give the same rewards.
---
Yes sir.
---
Odds are if it's an opulent mod, it'll only appear on oppulent gear of the same type. I.E menagerie mods or leviathan mods
---
Why in the world are you rolling around with 116 raid banners? And if you are never going to use stuff like rainmaker and such, just delete them. If you don't want to delete them, put them in the vault like the rest of us do.
---
But were can i play the red legion campaign
---
That was happening to everyone on our team during the raid lol. Every single death there was a corpse doing flips. Some of the Vex joined in too! XD
---
If you want to do red war you talk to Holliday
---
after new light
---
Make it an ARG: "Moon's Hunted"
---
They burn this boss because it’s more efficient for xp/glimmer/shells than waiting out the heroic version. The time invested in capturing him when he is frozen is not worth it.  So just blow him up and move on
---
Same just bought the jade rabbit I’m now working on getting it’s catalyst
---
Wrong travelers chosen and stubborn oak are currently 0 light
---
Is it just light now?
---
Oh so i have to reach the whole reach 770 light thing and such thats weird since it brings you to the new tower
---
If it works in Doom, it works here too.
---
I don't have to but I'm going to so when I get my bonus glory it will be over 2100. I got to 1982 then lost 3 straight games,won a game and got to 2074(that was a big oof) went on another 3 game losing streak. So I'm just waiting for the bonus points now before I'm outside of the glory bonus range to reach 2100.
---
you can do that with the sentinel super
---
I got it by doing a wish from the raid before that I didn’t complete but got a key and then my clan had a raid going and they needed a person for queens walk and got 1k on my first and only chest the other guy in the group said “You have now ascended they are all peasants now to you”
---
Taxes? You mean you have to pay taxes?
---
TRIGGER DISCIPLINE!
---
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
---

---
I bet you missed, and that's why it ended when it did
---
Again, you are taking 2 random unrelated points from my argument and making wild illogical associations. Where have i even mentioned the 25 cents in context of this example? The  comparisson of ww2 was directed at your argument "noone is putting a gun to your head" cuz the same as with this situation, just because you are not forced to expose yourself to unfair conditions does not change the fact that these people are doing something that simply put is not fair. I dont know if your intellect is to small to comprehend these simple comparissons or whats the natter with you, but this is getting ridiculous
---
NO LFGING HERE. go to fireteam finder or whatever its called
---
9.5/10 Well done, very artful dismount
---
That sounds like a bug.
---
Its lagging everywhere on all platforms.
---
Lol I’m stuck at the kill hunters in PvP part.
---
[removed]
---
The bright dust store is the same for everyone each week. Get things if you like the look of them since it's all cosmetic, but be aware that the Halloween event with Halloween cosmetics comes at the end of the month
---
That happened to me too.
---
That’s a big F
---
Yeah, I just ran a Sherpa for 4 fresh players last night.
---
The place still exists, though I don't know if it will give you anything. There's still an interactable loot box.
---
14k points needed. Every cold fusion medal gives around 200 points. Just get 70 of those and you're done.
---
Thanks and good luck to you. honestly it’s not as hard as I thought to get and I was playing freelance
---
Lol holy shit I'm an asshole and ignorant. My bad how did I never notice that?
---
Its just a jacket dude. That i like the looks of. Has nothing to do with what it represents. Bungie makes quality merchandise and wish i could buy it otherwise. And most likely everyone who beats the raid is not going to buy it because of the price. No need to be toxic.
---
With Shadowkeep Bungee pretty much removed the leveling system so that those who wanted to could jump right into content with their friends; each character is level 50 immediately. You get all those Triumphs/Trophies when making a character as a result.
---
Just got mine yesterday as well! Congrats!
---
Holy shit yes...disconnects every 10 minutes
---
Just Incase it’s what u mean:
---
You don’t kill the boss right away, you wait a bit and I believe 2 major wizards come out and you kill those before the boss. Savathuns song is pretty hard for me to solo by itself on chasm
---
What platform?
---
I am not afraid of you anymore
---
Forsaken exotics are a lot of fun and several are very strong, but they aren't so amazing that they completely outshine everything else. You'll be fine, just unable to utilize certain loadouts/playstyles, like liars handshake Hunter or peregrine greaves Titan.
---
I'm a fan of monte carlo, one two punch shotgun, pregime greaves and top tree hammers.
---
All the base game and old expansions are free to play as far as I know. I have only just come back to the game though so I could be wrong
---
No problem, I was trying not to sound condescending, I've been wrong quite a few times myself.
---
I thought your name was byf
---
OEM naturally
---
~ A Hunter
---
Any recommendations for fusions?
---
I'm surprised you haven't been banned for that 1 bar connection you got there...
---
I have been using one with  armor piercing rounds  pulse minister and rampage and if feels amazing and does really well in pvp
---
No. I had to buy them seperare. Bought Shadowkeep digital deluxe edition for 49.99 and then forsaken was an extra 19.99
---
Sometime bounties are bugged and won’t count your progress, best recommendation is abandon the quest and get it from the npc. As for your score some nightfalls are timed and the longer you take the points will decrease until completion.
---
You want it so bad, earn it yourself
---
How exactly do you counter it? Just curious to know.
---
Look at the asterisk, you get the Supers if you buy Shadowkeep, not Forsaken
---
Erintel is a great one.
---
Not yet i dont think.
---
Thanks and congrats as well
---
well that sucks
---
dont have access to any forge other than volundr until u get that quest done i think :/ cant do izanagi.
---
it‘s not a should charge, just a light shield attack from the super
---
which nightfalls arent timed
---
I just discovered this as well a little bit ago. It is amazing.
---
Never used recluse or mountaintop for PvP. Just seems boring to use em
---
Where?
---
with Shadowkeep expansion everyone gets bumped up to 750 including your gear
---
Im not here to argue. You're just being disrespectful at this point. Its a video game. And just a jacket i happen to enjoy.
---
Everything was kicked to 750 at the start of Shadowkeep.
---
When Shadowkeep/New Light came out all items in your inventory got boosted to 750
---
Lol, you mad
---
My friend also says my level should be higher should it?
---
The times one are usually on the harder difficulty
---
If your on ps4 I will be your friend and raid with you. We been looking for a 6th.
---
You don't have a heavy weapon yet, so that's dragging your PL down.
---
Was ur risk runner masterworked
---
Not really. Just shocked you're being disrespectful over something so minuscule.
---
so you cant get it from xurs fated engrams or world drops?
---
1. Matchmaking in PvE is based on connection. Are you playing on console? If so, check if your date and time settings are correct, as those being unsynced is known to create empty instances. Otherwise, try using a wired connection if you're wireless. 
---
2. I believe all campaign rewards are now removed, though some people have said that completing the Red War might award an exotic engram? (I think those saying that might have gotten the engram from the session pass due to campaign completion xp, though).
---
They have codes for sale on eBay
---
This was the easiest part for me hahaha,i just played crucible with my better demons and forgot about the quest!
---
lmfaoooooo you're just making my point
---
No because before the expansion the max light was 750 so now the Shadowkeep exp, everyone gets bumped up to 750
---
ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA

Also, you do get the RISK/REWARD quest where you can get New Light loot. So just do that when it comes up.
---
Its all good.

See what i mean?

It just seems strange

Pretty much.
---
Im not sure about exotics but no story for you.
---
What class?
---
Either wait, check after loading In to the destination or reset the game
---
I’m having the same issue. I get the prompt to “sift through the ashes” however there’s nothing there.
---
Damnnn Dio, you got it
---
good luck, guardian.
---
Which fusion rifle is that? Tia!
---
Is what a typo? Nowhere does it say that Forsaken includes Shadowkeep.
---
So there is no rewards for doing the story?
---
ZA WARUDO
---
BRRTTRZZZZZZTCH
---
Edit: thank you to whoever gave me gold, but seriously it’s the person who should get gold. I always wait for his guide before any other creators
---
mkay
---
He said golden gun so probably hunter
---
Nah, I was trying to cut the vid while he screams to make a “perfectly cut scream” vid.
---
I agree but I still panic and try my best not to overdo it. I managed to get to 2990 solo and I know it’s gonna be a very very hard and long fight to 5500. I don’t know if I will make it there in solo Q. 
---
Weapon consistency is something that irks me too. I can’t figure out what I should use and what I’m good with. One match it’s scouts, next it’s snipers..I’m a mess. Being a titan is rough too since I get rekt out of my super by a erianas vow or other weapons. I don’t know what meta weapons are current. I have a ways to go.
---
yeah, I'm using a solar hunter. I'll update the original post with what I'm using.
---
Talk to ada 1
---
Thank you
---
Oof
---
I still remember the theme to this day, and my ghost and guardian, and all the spereate dlxs that I couldn't afford like rise of iron and maybe house of wolves, default enemies that can be stronger than you.
---
Anybody on PS4 that wants to play Shadowkeep tomorrow, im abt to take off back to Europe and im hyped, but i so want someone else, i play since day 1
---
It’s talked very similarly before, in the book of sorrow where oryx finally communes with the deep
---
I mean the taken are haunting it so yes
---
alright even in your situation. What's the point in not having a large stack of them? All it means is less trips to petra (and now hawthorn) to get more
---
Carefully
---
He didn't though it was 5 pointed
---
Yea lol
---
yes, I'm aware as much. the problem is this blasted mechanic that literally spits on solo players.
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
/r/Fireteams
---
Amen
---
Thanks.
---
I knew I should’ve kept all that armor damn
---
Honestly they're all pretty fun, which sounds most appealing to you. 
---
The hunter stealthy and quick, silent but deadly.
---
Or perhaps the Titan, a wall for his brethren, a tank on the battlefield.
---
Or maybe The Warlock, weilder of the mystic arts, a harbinger of death.
---
Lmao I just got mine today it's an infuriating quest now that there's no clash or zones for farming kills
---
Try all 3! You get three player slots so why not right ?!
---
i’d hope so man
---
I’ll never get monte
---
Go find 30 souls
---
Im having the same problem, have you found a fix?
---
Somebody give this man his gold please
---
Same here man.... opened 100+ chests on the moon in the past 2 days but didn't get any new essences. Sector-, event-, world-, vex- and hive-chests. 
---
P.S. a Subjunctive with good rolls shreds mobs aswel for the time being, lol
---
Surprisingly not. Just have the Catalyst.
---
Oh hell yeah thank you!! (Its sad because I should know all of this as I've been playing since launch lol)
---
When you never got it so you had to use perfect paradox as a substitute
---
yea I also have this glitch so annoying
---
Oh, that makes more sense. The Cross save mentioned that purchased items wont cross over so that definitely clears it up. Thank you for clarifying!
---
Right when the boss dies
---
Never seen a new zone thats this dead lol
---
Looking at logistics though, Player A leaves match, punish Player A. That'd be a nice easy script to write. If Player A leaves match, Players B and C either get win or no penalty. This means changing the win/loss program to include this outcome. It sounds like a LOT more work and potential for bugs. Have a harsh enough penalty and people leaving should stop anyway.
---
♥️
---
Crooked Fang is her ultimate weapon.
---
Ps4 yeah
---
I just got last word, gonna get thorn and whisper soon, then start my grind for the pinnacle weapons. Shoulda never stopped playing but oh well
---
We are ps4
---
Pretty good honestly. Range masterworks are even more important than last season. You have outlaw and rampage, the dynamics duo of pvp perks. If you can put a rampage spec on it and you’re good to go.
---
I think the garden progeny 1 has mention of him and it's a scout rifle
---
same thing happened to me, starting to think there's a pattern
---
Helpppp
---
Corrupted ?
---
Do you not have an upgrade module?
---
isn’t that kinetic though?
---
yeah it was sad
---
Lmao what's that I just started
---
Look for 3 guys and choose a strike like on mars or earth. Go do public events 😁 not tried in d2 but thats how we did stuff like that in d1. On ps4 atleast you can change time and load in a strike solo if you want
---
I’d say for now replace it cause once you het higher light you can pull it out of collections at a similar light to your current light
---
Nice tattoo!!
---
it’s the opposite of this for me, fortunately
---
Nice
---
And that's exactly what she _wants_ you to think 😄
---
Thanks for the input much appreciated

Yes

No

Dismantle life, Yes?

Divinity in pvp be like: “Dismanle Game, Yes?

either way i hope bungie actually makes a vanguard room like in d1, kinda weird conducting our plans out in public with only zavala
---
Should be potato
---
I don't play on pc. So you're saying my internet is bad because latency over distance exists? You have got to be kidding me, we're talking distances of around 8,000 miles and more.
---
Hmm ill try that later. Sounds weird that they choose this as an activation mechanic.
---
Thanks guys, I tried forever trying to figure it out lmao.
---
That is exactly what everyone that reports you for lag is thinking "I just want to enjoy the game it isn't my fault Australia has shit internet."
---
How do you know that they are in Europe or Asia?
---
Looking over what I asked ill rephrase as I wasnt being specific enough does it crash other people if I shoot them with it in normal crucible matches?
---
Is this a meme or legit question?
---
As far as i know it crashes everyone in the game, at least it crashed all of my friend's games too
---
How the hell does this game work? I followed some quest to Earth and ended up doing the same mission/quest/whatever 3 times in a row. Is that normal? I walked around for half an hour killing random enemies and eventually got teleported to the same quest again so I left. There's a guy in a church who I think will give me something if I finish a quest but I don't know which one or how to do it. Should I be doing the legacy campaigns? Or should I follow the New Light quest line?
---
Thanks
---
Crucible Menu from Destinations Tab. Then on the right hand side, you'll see a node for Survival. Next to this node, it's a small white note called Survival:Freelance. 
---
Freelance is for solo players.
---
Can it show a new page of every single shaded we’ve unlocked and it costs shards and glimmer to apply the shader straight onto the item instead of going to collections, re-acquiring the shader, then applying it? I feel like this would be more practical
---
Man either those guys let their cats play with the controllers or they were straight potatoes.
---
Meme
---
And that’s why Destiny 2 should have an offline mode.
---
You still take damage but Melee'ing just at the beginning of a stop will Keep you in range.
---
I'm having a similar issue. I cannot seem to complete "Enhance" on PS4. I'm seeing no more quests on the EDZ map.
---
I just got a go figure.im guessing it's good?
---
This is the first time I have seen that thing kill something
---
Na Ghillie pistol. For that added stealth.
---
Hey, I played comp against this guy! Our team won, but he did fine!
---
I’ve read them all on google but if I get to one and I forget what to do I just stop shooting until I get a queue it is activated or until other newbs like me finish it off.
---
For comp or pvp?
---
That’s how most people do it yes. You can use it before getting master of arms but it’s meh.
---
Once master of arms activates tho the thing is broken
---
PvP preferably
---
F
---
i tried to get that shader for so long. i got it like a week before forsaken. its super ugly but i love it
---
Well wtf... I'm awful at this game and my opponents are crushing me. My power is high from grinding pve but...
---
Lol! Depends on the roll and your play style. I don’t use it, but it’s a popular weapon that drops a lot so I used it in my example.
---
You charge it into a melee attack. 
---
Either way it's a one hit kill..be grateful for it.
---
This is painful to watch
---
Fuckin literally
---
....loads unstoppable rounds into his hand cannon....NOT TODAY SATAN!
---
it can also mean "crazy" in slang
---
Finally someone who knows how to use this weapon
---
(sorry for the horrible pun) 
---
Thanks for clarifying stuff for a returning player
---
I met him in the crucible the other day
---
I legitimately have so much fun in comp, especially now that’s it’s 3v3
---
No, I win, I’m better cause I got free code from my clan, that I lead, because I showed my dominance. You lose because you sleep in your parents house.
---
I'm sure people have Bounties, Quests, Triumphs, personal feelings they can't cope with in any other way, or they just wanna stall your team. I mean, they're using 1 person to delay 4, while 3 continue working on the other team, that's always beneficial if the Invader even only kills 2 people
---
I say that just to let you know I'm never flexing, I'm just kinda hoping I'm not a detriment to my team if I at least get enough Guardian kills
---
Great use of one of my favorite memes of all time. Thank you for this.
---
Definitely would go with Icarus Grip, atleast that helps my playstyle so you drill people from above, which is real useful for surpise attacks and avoiding shotgun runners
---
The Doritos are tangy cheese flavor and the poster is of the movie Gemini Man. 
---
It's supposed to be the ending of Shadowkeep.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
My clan tend to hate on drifter.  I like him. A lot. But then again, they suck at gambit
---
yeah there is tons of sub-clans to it. never been a part of it but there is a website you can sign up on i believe.
---
PvP
---
The pain simply eminates from this clip
---
Hmm never thought about that!
---
FINISH HER
---
Thanks for clarifying that. I started over earlier anyway! I feel bad for anyone almost done with the vanilla campaign, haha.
---
You didn't miss anything, that's the new light starting point. Every new player to destiny 2 since October 1st new light/shadowkeep launch starts at 750. You're more than likely reading old pre-shadowkeep posts. Just go see Amanda in the hangar to pick up your older campaigns for the story-based stuff that you've missed by diving in at year 3.
---
So is it a mix of ghall and truth??
---
It’s a drop from the Strange Terrain nightfall.
---
dr stone is a great show
---
please consume me Riven
---
The darkness ships are triangular and have been referred to as doritos before.
---
Gemini man is because the last currently released story mission ends with &gt;!us staring ourselves, or a clone of us, down!&lt;
---
r/unexpectedjojo
---
I did strikes and crucible and got packages with tokens and grinded to around 850 started to reckoning got stuff from that farmed a decent spare rations in reckoning 2 got a decent fate cries foul and now only play crucible bottom tree arc strider
---
Then it wouldn't be different than any other bow. It may suck, but it's supposed to be special.
---
NERF Recluse
---
HM slaves typically refers to pokemon like bidoof that can learn 4 HMs and thats all you have on them
---
We need videos of hearding kinderguardians.
---
The Trickster seems to still be alive, hmm.
---
true. In the nightfall I was using bubble with helm of saint 14 and we took them down fine so I guess thats another way titans can beat them
---
This is on the moon.  Could have been the trickster still, but it wasn't the tangled shore adventure ;p
---
hence the apology
---
For cryo you have to damage the pod for the orbs to spawn
---
I agree with the statemates above. Destiny has been out for many years and the vault suggestions should have been day 1 features!
---
https://i.redd.it/gaet0xoujfs11.jpg
---
Kinda reminds me of friendly creepers
---
Sadly no you can't turn them in to the respective destination vendor without going in person. Much like you can't turn in crucible/vanguard tokens without going to the tower to do so.
---
Thx owo!
---
How can I tell which planets are the current flash points? (sorry, new player)
---
Thx
---
im pretty sure there is no skill-based matchmaking anymore.
---
DO NOT START FROM LEVIATHAN 
---
Start from either Eater of Worlds or scourge of the past, those are the 2 easiest and fastest raids to do (will take around 1-2 hours with a good Sherpa) and then do leviathan, that's my advice, leviathan tends to be hard on new players.
---
That is why matchmaking for all activities is not a very good idea...
---
How did he do that much damage?
---
And as per usual the new monarchy stuff looks 10 times better :)
---
Finish the story then do the quest eris gives afterwards
---
100% stupid. I know.
---
is that mod in the artefact or just random drop?
---
Infusing one weapon into another will consume the infused weapon and raise the power level of the weapon you're infusing into up to the level of the consumed weapon.
---
It’s either of the survival modes, doesn’t need to be freelance
---
Who do you think “they“ are?
---
It is a glitch. You can repeat the Nessus one and it count for the fourth.
---
And they left out the sidearm
---
Great idea
---
Cos I have been playing classic mix on crucible and I’m already fabled 2 there and my noob self thought that was comp so I’m confused why I still don’t have the recluse
---
“Bout to end this fireteams whole career”
---
Ha ha, yep hammerhead is an absolute unit in gambit.
---
Trust me, OP, this is a moot point now. The community has gone back and forth about how whatever super is broken in crucible and Bungie's answer was to make them easier to shut down. I've seen plenty shut down at this point, but they're taking between 1-3 guardians to do. You win some, you lose some I guess.
---
2nd slot in the artifact with SMGs, Auto, and Bow mods
---
Thanks a lot dude for helping out a kinderguardian like me
---
Is each ball a one hit kill? I may have to try this. 😀
---
The feels
---
Hell yeah Lore Is Life 😈
---
Yea .. me too lol it never dropped i remember doin this shit months ago hours on end
---
Hotel? Trivago.
---
Lol yup I agree cant wait for the next grimoire to come out I'm so excited

Getting into this game was a struggle honestly, but after finding some sense of direction I went way too deep and now I can't find a way out

You have to do 7 rounds (at any level) and the encrypted key will turn into a decrypted key. You can see how many rounds you have completed by looking at the image of the key and you will notice some little triangles that will be lit up. After it’s decrypted, you can then unlock the final boss chest.
---
You can also only buy one encrypted key per week so it will take a couple weeks to get the full armor set. The weapons you get also rotate weekly. The shotgun is probably the main thing you might want.
---
Oh yeah, their easier to kill but I’m not about to give away a life to attempt to kill a 30second long super, it’s. It like hunters not a duration increase, we legit last 8-12 seconds depending on how much we attack.
---
I remember seeing you guys!
---
It’s because, well it brings death.
---
There's a purple dog that screams really loud nearby.
---
If you got a piece of gear before they added the collection tab and deleted it. Then the game will make you reacquire it. Js.
---
Dismantle Wrath Incarnate public clan yes?
---
rip monte carlo
---
Jade Rabbit is such a good PvP scout!
---
Be sure to be buying both the armor piece from him if you don't already have that exotic, and the **Fated Engram** as well. The Fated Engram is a guaranteed exotic that you don't own until you own all the Year 1/2 exotics your class can use, so it's the best way to start filling out your exotic list. If you plan on trying out other characters, start buying the exotic armor for the other classes, too, since you'll have them unlocked for that class when you make one that way.
---
You can safely dismantle exotics you buy from Xur since you can always pull an exotic out of the Collections menu for a small materials cost.
---
Cause no one cares for obj. They are there to farm kills for quest and bounties
---
No. I'm on mobile away from home so not sure if the app is accurately portraying what I'm supposed to be seeing on my Xbox. I might have to Google this shit
---
nice
---
There is r/destinyrule34 not sure if that's it but there's something like that
---
Thanks for the info
---
Seems a bit selfish considering its not that difficult to do both and they can always play clash
---
What do you mean, exactly?
---
Shaxx broke her in a different way
---
There should ALWAYS be a clash option as for many guardians zone control is a very tough intellectual pursuit.
---
You might have the hud turned off
---
Check in the accesibility menu ( in the settings off your character screen) , and check the Level of the HUD, switch it high (default) should solve your problem.
---
So that means even if I dismantle my jade rabbit I can still getting it back
---
r/rule34
---
Welcome to the fight; eyes up guardian! :)
---
Only people with a very high IQ can understand the control game mode
---
It's actually r/rule34destiny
---
For some reason my dumb browser isn't loading the googledoc for the guide, so sorry if this was adressed there.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm looking for a clan, preferably a chill one with no quotas etc so I can still play the game at my own pace (with my admittedly crappy internet) but have somewhere to turn to when I get to raids and such. I still have lots to learn about the game. So, where do I go from here to find a clan? Should I look for one specifically in my country or does physical distance from other players not matter when playing together? idk if we're peer-to-peer connecting to a host or to a server.
---
Dark souls is a different type of game. I guess the point is that destiny 2 used to be very good at this so this feels like a step backwards.
---
If I read correctly, you bought Red War and Curse of Osiris at launch, which means that you are 3 years ahead of any new light player
---
They wouldn’t add pron at the end and I decided not to correct it
---
That does not look spicy at all! Sad Cayde noises..
---
Repost much?
---
Don't break my heart again
---
Noooooo
---
I’m sorry :,( 
---
But I would be so fitting
---
It hurt me more thinking about it then it hurts you reading it
---
me: ****doesn't do any strikes and just plays crucible****
---
also me: this game is fucking boring
---
Sometimes yes but like I bet 90 percent of people posting easily answerable questions here are just either too lazy/dumb to google or they simply are like “huh might as well get some karma and get my question answered”
---
Yep!
---
For exotic weapons, *there is literally no difference between any drop of that weapon, for anyone*. All the perks are guaranteed, and pulling the item from collections will be the *absolute exact same* as if you get the item from anywhere else. Catalyst progression is also saved since that's tracked in a Triumph.
---
For **exotic armor**, the stats and element you get from a **natural drop** will be different from the *static roll* that Collections will give you. So you might get a better version of those from playing the game and getting exotics to drop, but you can still pull a version of it from your collections.
---
Yeah I feel like I spend as much time looking at weapon guides and various resources to try to learn all the dense systems and how they interact as I do playing the game. But I love that. The more meat there is to a game the more I enjoy chewing it. But lets face it not everyone is prepared for that kind of commitment.
---
I'm not mad just tired of reading bs like this. Recluse is extremely easy to get now. I couldn't get it before, I got it last night in 3 hours of freelance survival. Supers and heavy are part of this game and people need to suck it up or not play and stop crying on Reddit about it.
---
Easiest solution i found is just to Upgrade to Tier 2, then you will get lock gear
---
Where do I play glory, and where do I check my valor for that
---
Omg I would love a wood gun
---
rumble is line free for all, control is like capture the flag and survival is survival xD
---
Its still good. But Titan is better.
---
With one two punch, peregrine greaves and solar shoulder charge, you can hit in a single blow around 84 meless at once, whereas as liars handshake made around 30 I think. Pair that with montecarlo to gain melee energy and you are unstopable.
---
If you want to stick to Hunter, sure, use the liars handshake, but watch out, some bosses will three hit kill you with slams or send you against a wall.
---
Yes officer this post right here
---
The Emblems?
---
The Dismantle Gambit one is from Gambit, this season. There is a pursuit for it, go talk to Drifter to get it. (It's the Shaders + Emblem one)
---
The Second one is I believe from the Corrupted Nightfall (Could be wrong on that, but I'm assuming)
---
And finally the last one is from Strange Terrain Nightfall (The alternative version of that Emblem)
---
So what are you saying? People shouldn't be able to use the guns they earn? Or every gun you don't like should be nerfed into the ground?
---
Right but I had a better chance of getting it through bounties rather than random world drops right? And what exactly counts as random world drops, when it physically drops in front of you?
---
Yeah I have the titen set up it's good just wanted something similer for my hunter. Titens got some real love in shadokeep
---
Great, now i want some Doritos...
---
Truth to be told, I have never seen our clan Admin online. This branch of Wrath Incarnate is basically self run at this point.
---
Just started the game. I completed the first red war mission. Do I have all abilities and leveling unlocked for my Titan already? It looks like all the skill trees are already unlocked for me. Can I change later or if I pick something, am I stuck with it until I start a new character. I have no idea what I'm doing. Thank you in advanced.
---
Glory is now only through the survival mode in crucible (middle right playlist iirc), and you can check your valor when selecting a gametype like Rumble and looking at the top left while you're queued and looking for other players.
---
My clanmates and I played with that, it's fun considering this is a game about saving the universe from existential destruction with powerful weapons and abilities granted by a god of light.
---
Had the same thought for weeks now.
---
I commented above, I had a similar occurrence. I bought 3 copies of a shader from Tess while it said contacting destiny servers, and after disconnecting and reconnecting I didn’t have the shaders and it wasn’t in my collections.
---
Thank you for the help.
---
More noob questions?  
---
- how do I decide what to keep and what to dismantle? Exotics are very rare I know, so I bank them until I am at the cap light level so I can upgrade them to that level. But "legendary" would also be an incredibly valuable rarity in any other game, but I have so many that I am running out of space. Are there convenient ways to re-aquire legendaries I like at later levels so I can do an actual 'build'?  
---
- is there a way to turn armors into transmog sets? I got that sweet "Substitutional Alloy" set from the season pass, but as it always is in this game, i will soon equip something else because I outlevel it. If I want to keep the look, is there any way (except upgrading the suboptiomal armor, of course)
---
It has to be an ignition, not just going to the place and killing
---
Ah so u gotta buy em separately? Buying shadowkeep won’t get both? Don’t mind either way just so I don’t buy shadowkeep expecting forsaken to be there and know I need to pay both seperately
---
Lumina with the lucid melody ornament
---
AAAAAAAHHHHHHUUUUURRRGGHHHHHH
---
I know I’m trying to get the quest to drop and I was told and read you just to kill fallen to acquire it but this is ridiculous at this point I don’t think I’m this unlucky for it to not drop after hours I’m assuming I’m doing something wrong
---
Have you seen this shirt though
---
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouFellForItFool/)
---
Yeah that’s the part I am currently having difficulties with. I went ahead and solo’d queued a survival match and hit Fabled just now. So all I have left are these damn double kills lol. I may just wait for Iron Banner and play for the double kills then since I heard progress is doubled during the event.
---
I need to see if I have night watch, also, were your first few games hard? Like I was struggling to get a win, I just got 3 in a row with double digit kills.
---
Yea
---
This dude found the right symbols for the death notification 
---
Lol
---
That’s what I did and it wasn’t as bad as I thought it as gonna be doing solo
---
No prob, and good luck!!
---
:'(
---
it´s faster to melt the boss and do a lost sector, befor the next event starts
---
Thank you for the explanation!
---
I couldn't get recluse last season, couldn't even come close. This season I got it in a couple hours. It's really not hard playing freelance due to the fact you lose like 10 glory for a loss and gain over 100 for a win.
---
Ok strikes have matchmaking but if you don’t find anybody it will just plop you in by your lonesome self. Raids you need to a set fireteam there is no matchmaking. Go look lfg destiny 2 to find raid groups, I would recommended on looking up what to do though considering a lot people get angry if you screw up and will kick you on just one mistake. If you are looking for pve story go to Amanda Holiday at the tower, left of when you spawn in.
---
I am also confused by this. I assume I've completed "shadowkeep" and "in the deep" remains replayable on map. Shadowkeep in quest log has dissapeared so I imagine it's over. BUT the puzzling thing is I still cannot play vex offensive because I have not met a story requirement... I'm confused as heck. Lol.
---
Want some help then?
---
I just wiped the full team 3 times in prime with hammerhead. MG is definitely the way to go.
---
I’m holding out on buying shadowkeep until I can get my grades back up lol
---
Hell yea bro! jaka1000 is my psn
---
The salt is strong with this one LMFAO
---
Honestly I just avoid crucible completely. Gambit’s my cocaine.
---
That is some nonce behaviour... Very nice
---
I need a clan
---
I don't know how Bungie overlooked that shit, deathbringer blows.
---
Damnit, I'm guessing that Gemini man has to do with nightmare sounding ghost from the trailers meaning my theory about that is true. 
---
Fuck you
---
(Not really, im just super angry, luckily not much could have been spoiled.)
---
Alright i got my next quest line to go for! Thx
---
I don’t mind the steps themselves, just when they’re unnecessary, eg lumina’s quest.
---
Also I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been kicked from a raid for someone else with mountaintop recluse. Maybe not in shadow keep it has happened at least ~12 times.
---
Edit: Theres nothing wrong with handouts. Borderlands literally shits weapons at you and I don’t see any people complaining.
---
On Friday the burns for vanguard strikes void and heavy weapons so I was two shotting bosses left and right
---
I still have the “In the Deep” quest aswell, however I’m able todo the Vex Offensive. Have you completed the little quest that Ikora gave you? Because that should be your ticket into the Vex Offensive.
---
Whats unbalanced about it? Are some guns or classes op or?
---
The same thing is happening to me, I know for sure I had the last word at some point but I can’t seem to find it in my collections anywhere.
---
You're welcome
---
I would just like to add to what others have already commented that Bungie has a really sour relationship with Sony now. PS4 may have been the best place to play D2, but PS5 won’t be. There is no way Bungie would be a launch title for them anymore. Bungie is trying to move out from under their shadow, and we saw this recently when they appeared at Microsoft events and announced new features. It’s not that they are changing camps, they are fully independent and don’t want to be cozy with either of them. They actually chose to partner with Google Stadia, and Shadowkeep is going to be one of the first free games to launch the platform. As in free with the subscription for as long as you subscribe, like Game Pass. Activision had the partnership with Sony, and that burned to the ground when they left. Bungie saw it as oppressive to the community to favor any one platform.
---
Take a ghost shell that marks titan chests, go to Titan, open chests. 
---
Titan is small and chests are clutered, the shell is also fairly common.
---
You can also do strikes for that 10x Rad Culture or normal drops.  Public events do well too.
---

I also had a fun one the other day xD
---
You might have your hard drive partitioned and partition you're trying to download to isnt big enough for download
---
I think they dialed it down because heavy is OP as fuck.
---
You can get beloved from the chalice of opulence
---
What is this light level thing? Is it the same as your power?
---
If ur new to the game I’d go around and talk to all the vendors first. Bunch of new quest!
---
I believe that you can still play menagerie, so you could probably still get beloved
---
Hey guys, how do i play forges?
---
Man I would trade my only N-word pass for his life
---
Izanagis burden, recluse and wendigo 4 pve rn. 
---
Oxygen is not worth the grind
---
E
---
Watch it be sunbreakers
---
Alright. I can managed with controller, but I prefer keyboard and mouse imo. Thank you.
---
Yeah I don't know why people are bitching, they're literally handing out the gun now with the new comp system.
---
At least the exotics can be got by rng. The exclusive swords can’t but maybe they are aware of that idk. Be an easy fix to just slap it a vendor or something. 
---
I guess I’ll just wait to see what happens and what they do to help new players. I see so many post about confuse new light players not knowing what to do after the tutorial.
---
Yes you can still get it and other weapons from past seasons.
---
No it can't (imo).
---
I've picked them all up except gambit, but I'm missing a lot it says I should have. Hopefully in wrapping up all the planetary missions will unlock the rest.
---
But it’s pho...
---
Certain elements on armor are able to roll different mods. There are plenty of cheat sheets so find a mod you want to run in a specific element. Any armor that rolls with over 60 stats is worth holding onto so ultimately you’ll want 3 pieces per slot, one of each element
---
aw dang that's a shame. i thought it would have to do with the destiny 2 app but go figure. thanks anyway!
---
I think it has to do with mods. Like for instance, if u want a void resistance mod, it would cost like 4 energy, meaning you have 1 energy left to spend on another mod.
---
WAS WONDERING if TEM CAN purcahse IZ EROS shell or IZ it too late? ANY OTHERS tem can get?
---
The energy level on armor determines the amount of mods you can put on the armor. Mods require a certain amount of energy to be slotted onto armor. The element of the armor is also for mods. Some mods only work with certain elements.
---

Whenever you shoot An OEM-wearing Titan, you get a Mark of Vengeance. They can see the mark through walls. If they kill a Mark, they get heals and an Overshield.
---
Imagine listing 6 shot golden gun as the best pvp subclass for hunter.
---
We are mere thralls compared to stitch
---
It basically means fuck you. 
---
But in all seriousness, some mods can only be equipped on certain elements.
---
Will keep an eye out for those exotics. Thanks!
---
Thanks mate but i also need 200 games for Eryana Vow Catalyst ...so i just need this to be fixed
---
Your taking damage get off the inventory screen and fight.
---
Git gud
---
People like to sweat in quickplay because they don't actually like competitive, or playing against people at their skill level, they like winning. And using the same loadout for over a year. I'll never understand
---
I'd cross check, I've not actually played any comp myself yet. Too busy with life
---
Ooh I dont play pvp, but if you're a D1 veteran I'd say dont think that the shoulder charges are one shot. Whenever I play I always anticipate a one shot kill, cause thats how it was in D1, but theyre 2 shot in D2. Also, the little shield thing you can deploy by holding your crouch button is really good for securing checkpoints and if youve got a squad you're working with. As for pve... the Sentinel subclass is good for standing your ground and defending you team. Especially during boss fights. Sunbreaker is ok. And Striker is pretty good for add clearing and dealing a good chunk of damage to a boss in the start of a fight.
---
That's how I've been getting paired up. Top of the board for my team each game but my teammates barely get half as much don ed as I do
---
I feel it, but all stories gotta end.
---
You’re probably the loser with recluse and revoker. Shut up.
---
I know right.
---
Yeah we should just be space magic apes an only get to melle and it only does 20 dmg
---
Weak auras?
---
Also, this was just low-mid settings (1080p) because my PC sucks ;_;
---
I never said that you didnt
---
If youre going from a hunter to a titan, you should be aware that you will be slower and will be more resilient to damage.
---
Still too soon
---
Oh I definitely feel slower but a lot more tankier
---
What do you play on? It looks really nice!
---
Appreciate it!
---
no but you shouldn't be able to one shot. neither should a throwable shield that literally seeks enemies and bounces off fricking walls. if ima get hit anyway at least gimme a chance to survive. pvp is so unbalanced.
---
How long did it take you, and any tips?
---
just lost points in two games and i'm under 1000
---
Np
---
Stay in the playlist for a while and your skill bracket will balance out and you will have a better time. As far as people leaving it happens and sucks but they get the full loss penalty and you will only lose a small amount of points.
---
I am very pleased with the competitive adjustments in Shadowkeep. The grind was fun and enjoyable.
---
I seriously didn't believe in myself at first, but I stuck with the grind anyway. It's amazing what you can learn and how you can actually figure out a playstyle. I thought all that stuff was made up because I'm really no good, IMO, at PVP.
---
I believe it took me less than or around 20 rounds, whether that is good or not I don't know. There was a point in the middle where I had an 8 game losing streak.
---
Happy to be a part of the family now fellow guardians.
---
Top 10 anime betrayals
---
What sword are you talking about? If you’re talking about the worldline zero it’s not campaign acquired, you get that sword by destroying hidden elemental nodes all over mars, not by playing campaign
---
You get a lot of re# content and red hive
---
PC. Just low mid settings at 1080p.
---
You're such a pos human being for even joking about that. I truly hope you find Jesus, you need him badly. Judgement Day is the only thing we all will have in common, you either serve Lucifer or Yahweh and Jesus. Choose wisely you misguided fool. If you ever joked about children being trafficked and ritual sacrificed in front of me.. Boy would you be sorry... To think it's a joke really boils my blood. And your evil heart shows as well. Father forgive them, they know not what they do. In Yeshua's name, ahmen.
---
only one I've gotten is wardcliff
---
Man I came back last season and solo qued my way to all the crucible weapons it was a terrible grind that I hope no one over has to go through. These changes are great this season with a few outlying problems imo
---
Also why even play warlock
---
I personally like this. When I got in I loved the amount to do. Yeah, it was all thrown at once with no direction, but there’s so much!
---
What rewards are you referring too? Everyone starts at 750 old or new player.... as you play old or new campaign you get drops, blue, purple, exotics they all boost you up to 900, after you hit 900 then powerful rewards are unlocked to start the next climb on power to 950.
---
See my comment for more. Stick with your team, learn when to run away. It's helpful and can save you a round. Rushing isn't always best.
---
Figure out your team mates playstyles, if possible.
---
Do bounties, gives you something else to focus on. 
---
HAVE FUN, IT'S JUST A GAME!!!
---
Cheese’s haunted
---
yes but what about black armoury and the season pinnacle weapons? what about the menagerie?
---
Oh okay thanks
---
Alright, so I’m not new to D2 by any means, I played up until the 2nd DLC dripped, took a break until season of the drifter, and played again until the season of opulence started, don’t know anything past that point and just wanted some quick tips and updates on what most people are grinding out for later game content
---
It comes on about a dozen different exotics ghosts. You have to either get one to randomly drop from Eververse or buy a shell for bright dust when Tess is selling it. 
---
This link shows all the shells that come with the perk, so keep an eye out (some of these are seasonal and won’t be available again):
---
https://light.gg/db/items/1255489387/guiding-light/
---
Awww thanks, luv u 2 babe
---
Hey, I forgot about those bounties (again), thanks for reminding me, Reddit!
---
Are you on XBox One? It just happened to me twice in a row, as well as a lot of other XBox users according to Bungie.net
---
Having a blocking super isn't exactly amazing. Dodging a Slova Bomb and killing the caster is
---
Awesome! Thank you!
---
Pretty much what happened to Vell Tarlow.
---
So I was trying to do some Crucible matches today for the first time. First match went fine, had a win and whatever. Second time I tried to queue I got disconnected in the loading screen and it informed I would be punished for this... OK I thought and queued again and was yet again disconnected in the loading screen and now I am timed out from the queue? I didn't get any error codes or anything - just a pop-up saying Im a terrible human being and should consult the online faq which of course didnt' help. 
---
My connection is a 100/100mbps connection and I have never experienced any issues in any other games. Any ideas why this is a problem?
---
It just wasn’t funny and didn’t make sense
---
Thanks mate 🙏🏼
---
I've tried to do this before when i'm alone.  was doing comp and all my allies left.  enemy team had no mercy.  so i just sat by a wall and waited for the match to end.  I try to do this when on the oposite end when against only one guy.  but unfortunately,  they just shoot me.  guess i'm not allowed to be friendly.
---
I dunno, I got trashed when I didn't have expansions, but then I got forsaken and it has some real nice guns, but who knows, Shadowkeep might have some *even nicer* guns.
---
I would suggest it, forsaken was a great dlc and you get the annual pass for free with it now.
---
No they aren't.
---
You did! Glad to see you down here where sun doesn't shine!
---
Bro it feels so good after getting it. Just take a break and keep trying.
---
WHAT?! WHAT?! HOW?!
---
There are hidden paths, secret items, and even attacks with weapons that have hidden mechanics in game. There is plenty in DS that is never explained. Not just lore.
---
Your god is dead.
---
Edit: I have worked hard to fine tune this evil heart and it warms my heart to know it shows :')
---
Did you forget grimoire cards existed?
---
You need purple armor to put on ornaments. Also, those purple armors need to be the new 2.0 ones.
---
+ oppressive darkness
---
You can download games while not in the game, yes.
---
Oh okay, I see now, I guess I’m not that far in the artifact as I wasn’t aware it gives power boost, thanks 🙏
---
Thank your for the explanation, didn’t know that
---
Everyone knows the best sparrow racers are on Xbox
---
You’re playing a game. Of course kids are gonna play it. If it’s that big of an issue mute them
---
Cat Stevens should enjoy a bit of guitar solo though...
---
Sounds good. Thanks man
---
And everyone knows the best glitch finders are on pc
---
Short answer: Yes.
---
May be so but I don't have an Xbox
---
Something is wrong with your connection bud
---
it was probably coldheart or Prometheus lens then
---
i can email mine at no price for u, im not gonna use it
---
Not soon enough. Titans run to defend their exotic when everybody and their brother went against work husk calling it 'unfair and broken' until it was nerfed to the ground. It wasn't even close to as good as one eye mask, but I don't want them to make this exotic useless. 
---
They need to tweak and make it have only tracking and health regen. The over shield is ridiculous. 
---
When i was working on getting to legend this season, I had to hope the one eye scrub was on my team because I didn't want to deal with it. 
---
Titans get a broken exotic, had a broken super for months, a gernade that has the same effect as a hunter's SUPER, and get a one hit kill melee. You had your time and now it's time to let other people have fun too. 
---
Striker went months without a nerf, but wraith and nova warf got an nerf immediately. It did the same thing as striker, but nope no nerfs for the titans.
---
 Warlocks get one hit and miss melee on one tree. Titans get a one hit melee on every tree. Hunter doesn't get any. Do you see the problem? 
---
I'm not saying nerf titans into the ground. I'm saying make the other classes just as good or bring titans down to the other classes. Give each Class a one eye scrub and one hit kill. One class does not deserve a broken exotic. All or none. Even the playing field.
---
Ok?
---
Wanted to get back into D2, I have the year 1 dlc (Osiris and warmind) and I was wondering what dlc would I need to buy in order to be caught up? Can I buy just the newest one, or would I need to buy all dlc I don’t have ?
---
OOF
---
Yeah that will make it much easier, more guardians to kill plus you can have that light level advantage. I actually made a great deal of progress during mayhem, using tether to get a couple of them and and colony to snag the double kill. Mountaintop was the most painful grind I've ever encountered on this game.
---
Haven’t played in a long time but transferred my characters from ps4 to pc. What are some things I should be doing? What are the go to guns right now?
---
Go to moon talk to erdas she gives you first sk mission. Aftdr that the story mission is open
---
So today I did try the quest it was totally fine idk why
---
Same man same I have no idea what to do rn lol
---
Shadowkeep
---
Thank you! We are about to start making resin pendants with the classes on each.  Will def post them up when it's done
---
It has impressive damage fall off...several.meters better than most other in it's frame.
---
Happened to me too
---
I never use mine. Such a shame as its sexy as fuck
---
Reeeee
---
Okay, hiding the story mode by saying it's "legacy quest"? That's a bad idea. I had a very strange experience not understanding anything in this game, until I realized that New Light puts you in as if you've finished the story mode of the game. Why do the do that? It is so confusing.
---
You know it actually doesn't bother me that there isn't a huge fan base around it like most mainstream games have. The game is really entertaining for me and thats all that counts to me.
---
Masterful work 10/10 would meme afain
---
So true and the skin you can put on it yo remember cayde makes me slightly happier about getting it.
---
One-shooting in a fps means that you have to pay less attention to that target, which allows you to pretty much accidentaly kill someone. The lower the ttk the easier it is to kill someone, therefore the easier the game. 
---
And no, having bullets that take time to arrive to the target doesn't make the game harder, its straight up uncomfortable. In Destiny, the snipers are hitscan to maximize the speed of the player's reaction when they see the red light of scoping. 
---
In games such as battlefield, you can allow a sniper to have "slow bullets" since the movement in those games is very limited compared to Destiny 2
---
Go to sorrows harbour, and kill the nightmare hive protector ogre a load of times, you can find it by looking for the huge nightmare mass thing
---
I want to hear the scream of your ennemies ! The Hive isn't your nightmare. 
---
YOU ARE THEIR NIGHTMARE.  
---
YOU ARE THE DANGER.  
---
( skyler !)
---
The only clan name used more often that is “Cabalz Deep.”
---
I have no regrets getting it because I love pvp, but if all the steps look to boring I would say no
---
I’d also like to know this. I know as far as other quests went as long as you get to the rank it ticks it off. So you could get the 500 kills later even in a new season. Could be different in this one though.
---
I remember when a friend ask me if I could fill his team for a scrim, and he was playing against Legend ranks. I could barely breath and it was really scary to play against that kind of superiority
---
So I'd need a weapon swap mod to make it viable in most cases there.
---
Can’t you turn aim assist off on console?
---
The portal doesn't spawn when you clear the Public Event. Once it starts, a Taken boss will spawn somewhere in the area. You need to hunt it down and kill it to spawn the portal. You have until the end of the PE to find it. Once the event is over, the boss disappears.
---
Shards or orphans rig
---
I don't get it... he just used whirlwind guard. Am i missing something? What's the deal here?
---
I’m with you dude it’s total bullshit when a dev only makes 90% of their AAA game totally free of charge instead of 100%. What a bunch of jerks amiright.
---
Amazing
---
We searched for a boss but we did not find it
---
I believe that it is because Shadowkeep is not marked as DLC but is linked to the actual account this time. Doesn't seem like it works for anyone game sharing sorry.
---
Feed Them before they find you
---
Go to your character screen, move left to Triumphs, go to Destinations, then Minor, and select Tribute Hall. Those are the Triumphs. 
---
You can also buy them from the statue.
---
Hotel? Trivago
---
Yes i know it's a moon strike and i was able to do the exact one on random strikes and it didn't kick me out so if i could do it on there i see zero reason i shouldn't be able to do it on that one i wouldn't complain if it actaully kicked me out frkm the earlier moon strike but it didn't
---
Clans, lfg disc, destiny sherpa subreddits, not this subreddit ( for clarification)
---
Weapons didn't change, with the exception of mods no longer being limited use.
---
Already owned armor is unchanged, but if you pull a new exotic out of the collections, it will be 2.0.
---
That doesn't work for purples, but legendary armor will drop as 2.0 from now on.
---
Thank you, feel dumb now
---
I’m not to sure what you mean, in the directory at the top left it should say what to do next
---
The fucking post is about the guy complaining about only facing 3 stacks in comp
---
I leave sometimes (crucible) if I’m really bad, but that’s because I thought my bad playing brought the team down. Is that not the case? I don’t have a problem being shot a 100 times lol. It’s just a game. But I wouldn’t want it to suck for others because I’m bad at the game.
---
1. Most Clan chats most likely are quiet as most people are on discord talking but there should at least be some people who reply within chat otherwise -  [https://www.bungie.net/en/Groups/Forum?groupId=2111385](https://www.bungie.net/en/Groups/Forum?groupId=2111385) 
---
2. No.
---
People weren't lycan your joke
---
Well that's extremely unfortunate.
---
Nah he looks sick, I'm saying in general
---
https://www.ign.com/wikis/destiny-2/How_to_Get_Ace_of_Spades
---
Decrypts into Gjallartank.
---
Same. I like to try out new stuff and fool around. But if I'm struggling I crutch on favorites, like my Parcel of Stardust and Valakadyn. Or my black armory Galliard. Both great Auto Rifles BTW
---
...?
---
He blocked a Nova Bomb with it.
---
I think the concept was that players could jump right into strikes/gambit with their friends and not be under leveled. But you’re right, it’s super confusing for new players and should be signposted better
---
He is gone, but not forgotten.
---
We all miss him.
---
Yeah but then you gotta repurchase them. Wack.
---
true
---
Shoulda tagged it with spoiler man
---
I usually use Chaperone and Trust but I switch up Exotics every so often and I switch between all 3 Elements (Dawnblade, Stormcaller and Nova Bomb) depends on map and what mode it is
---
The current meta weapons are Izanagi’s Burden, the recluse, and the Wendigo GL-3. Each of those has a pretty involved quests to get them, but all are achievable. 
---
And just do whatever activities you enjoy. You’ll level up until you hit 900, then start doing powerful rewards to increase your power level
---
That Lumina starts to piss me off...
---
We passed fortnite
---
It's still once per week
---
How do you change the size of everything?
---
On my computer everything is way too big.
---
Sorry we beat fortnite
---
I’ve probably turned in enough parts for 5 or 6 engrams but they’re always rifles or pistols. I’ll keep trying whenever I can tho!
---
That's awesome :)
---
Sweet, thanks man
---
The gun is part of the black armour expansion in the year 2 annual pass. You can get this for free if you buy forsaken.
---
Reminds me of Tf2 conga parties.
---
Aim assist. Nice shot though.
---
I actually did this today without knowing during nightfall. Pretty damn amazing.
---
Nope you need the Black armory dlc
---
Back to the cosmodrome with you
---
Sleeper in D1
---
Some solid weapons you can get as a F2P player: Austringer Hand Cannon from Menagerie, Last Man Standing shotgun from Reckoning, Sole Survivor sniper from Reckoning, Bad Omens rocket launcher from Gambit, Blast Furnace pulse rifle from black armory, Halfdan-D auto rifle from the gunsmith, Outrageous Fortune grenade launcher from Zavala
---
Yeah I don’t even know wtf is going on anymore. I think the campaign of Shadowkeep was pretty dull
---
Never touch a running system. Got same loadout since forsaken
---
How about don't quit? You can still win lol. Quitters don't get rewards.
---
Made with mematic
---
Honnestly they can't do much. May be adding a "give up" option but there's nothing more they can do.
---
You don’t actually have to have your highest level gear equipped to get higher level drops. So long as it’s in your inventory, the game will be aware of it and think it’s your level and you’ll get higher level gear drops. Unless you’re getting shredded by enemies, just use the gear you enjoy
---
If it works well for you then it works
---
I didn’t realize it was wood(?) at first I thought you’d modded a .40 cal or something and painted it up. Looks awesome
---
1. It gets easier once you get a sparrow. 
---
2. Is your dad playing because he wants to play this game or because you want him to play this game?
---
You get the warmind campaign for free. To enter his room, the door only opens after killing all the Hive in the area
---
Spare Rations, not that great
---
Revoker, status symbol for sweat bag
---
Stompees, what? 
---
And I dont need to explain why it's a crutch just read its effect. It's all there black and white. Are you seriously so stupid you cannot even read what the exotic even does?! It's made into memes that proves it's broken! Just read its effect and tell me it's not a crutch! Damn you are dense.
---
I asked if he wanted to play and he said sure
---
It's not a lag switch. The servers were lagging really bad last night
---
Very accurate
---
Just like the whisper mission on nessies
---
You did get a bonus reward, and that was being able to play Destiny 2 for the last two years.
---
There’s a solid weekly powerful grind atm. If you have shadowkeep, you go strikes, nightfall, gambit, crucible, nightmare hunts, vex offensive, raid. That’ll hit basically all of the weekly powerful rewards. Plus if you’re chasing weapons, the moon/vex offensive/raid have great loot pools and (raid excepted) are pretty easy to farm god rolls for
---
You have to reach fabled and get all the wins needed.
---
 In previous seasons you'd get the wins before reaching fabled, but with the new system you usually reach fabled first. Keep winning and you'll get there eventually. 
---
If you have done the wins and reached fabled, but your quest won't update. Load into a crucible lobby. Wait for it to say 1/10 ..give it a few seconds and back out. It should update automatically.
---
Aka: kinda pay to win
---
1v3? I am not a pvp pro.... I don’t have any of the
---
OP weapons either.... no revoker, no recluse, no crimson etc.... I’m a titan and don’t have the broken one eye mask either.
---
Do you have enough ammo for both from one brick?
---
Bro y’all should just grind for recluse. It has never been easier to get
---
Does it cost a melee charge or anything? Sounds pretty cool, although both you and the enemy should probably be immune once the animation is locked in.
---
Moons haunted
---
r/fireteams
---
Please just bank we could’ve had a primeval a minute ago
---
Haven't played the offensive yet, but I already have  three of the weapons from moon drops.
---
Going for melee kills you could just run skullfort and shoulder charge, coming from a meathead titan with nearly 100k kills on an arc titan
---
I’m not angry at new players, I just thought this would be a funny meme to upload. I really didn’t know if I should’ve uploaded this meme because it seems against new light players.
---
Almost all menagerie weapons are great. Austringer I know is a top tier early weapon you can unlock with a fairly unfinished chalice as well as beloved. For rolls for austringer the pve roll is outlaw rampage range masterwork, pvp is outlaw opening shot range masterwork. Beloved pvp is snapshot sights quickdraw/moving target with range masterwork.
---
It feels like weapons which require skill are just pushed aside. All we need is another shitty mid range map instead of something different
---
How long was the rare bounty hunt? On it myself and it's frustrating..
---
Had all my teammates leave after the first round in Comp yesterday and the enemy team just hung out with me and then sent apology messages after the match
---
You have to equip it. A friend and me have been running scorched crucible matches and each game counts for progress, so if you have the season pass and level 22 it actually goes by pretty fast.
---
Could it just be alphabetical?
---
Considering caydes death was in the promotional stuff for forsaken a year ago. Including the poster/title picture anyone asking for spoiler tags is ridiculous
---
Merlin games does good lore videos
---
Haha sorry, the meme is good. I was worried about the "eventually" maybe i just got it wrong
---
Awesome. Thanks
---
It’s not listed in order of anything. It’s not a competition so there’s no real order based on stats
---
You got this homie took me 1 day to get it from 0
---
Will do mate, thanks
---
Lol normal strike carries, now that's something I haven't heard before
---
if there is a bug then its usally not fixable by doing anything untill bungie patches the bug i think.
---
No problem. Im not good by any means but judging by my views people seem to like lore videos. Maybe you will too.
---
It orders the players alphabeticaly
---
I feel really dumb and do not understand....
---
It's a known issue. They're working on it
---
Took me two day to get one randomly by turning in bounties. 
---
Luckily, the bounty I got was just kill enemies with the solar, void and arc damage while doing a forge.
---
No luck yet. It really sucks.
---
That original trailer made me want a Destiny movie sooo unbelievably bad
---
If you cant get the quickfang you can try and go for goldtusk, its quickfang but with randok rolls and master work, possible drop from heroic menaregie, remember, menagerie is matchmade, but not heroic menagerie.
---
Joe wait!
---
Who's Joe?
---
Joe sister
---
When you get Sunshot in the beta
---
just shoot the nova bomb or run from it
---
Saving this, will post in /r/MTCJ.
---
Dam  thank you for for such a detailed response I’ll definitely try out some of these combos.
---
Yeah I have this bug too wtf ??
---
It’s not a leaderboard. Because strikes aren’t a competition. 
---
But if you played with anyone whose name started with a Z I bet you’d get second place tho...
---
im sorry but if you fail one of the orb deposists you have to restart the whole dungeon so you can do all of the required steps for wishender to get it.
---
Why would I be stupid lol.  What’s wrong with offline mode.  It would prevent this from happening.
---
Use the search bar before posting, this has been asked and answered a dozen times.
---
Getting to fabled is piss easy now, just keep playing
---
Tell me what’s wrong with offline mode?
---
Mercury haunted
---
Well done.
---
That’s a known issue: you have to restart.
---
(I dunno if it’s a bug or an intended mechanic, so by “known issue” I just mean it’s how it’s always worked)
---
Ye I know, did it in an hour. It’s just a meme.
---
People don't play the campaign and move on because they don't know the campaign exists.
---
The new tutorial doesn't even mention that there is a story until hours in when it finally tells you who Amanda is. Meanwhile it rushes people towards strikes/crucible/gambit/leviathan without mentioning that you might want better gear before doing non-newbie friendly content.
---
How do I get the last word quest now? Everything says to just talk to drifter but it’s not there
---
Yes that’s why he made it his username
---
Please keep that orange buffon off Destiny 2.
---
What’s a guiding light ghost
---
I done it last night in probably 4 lmao
---
No lie, that sounds like a awesome name for a fictional character.
---
i got someone who was literally just the bow icon pasted 7 times over
---
By reading the thread, sounds like you don't have a steam acc. Easiest way for it then is to just tell him on his bday that you'll buy it for him and just give him your card/money etc. 
---
Unless you actually want to give him *something* then yes making a steam acc, friending him then buying as a gift is the way
---
Well this rant was already posted and people would not leave if after 2 minutes result would be 2:50. Bungie first need to fix the matchmaking. Apparently they dont have competent devs for pvp balancing. As far as pve content they are alright, but pvp sucks in every regard.
---
  Plus other real life issues other people posted above.
---
Thanks. I will PM you my xbox ID
---
Just the hunter. Decided I'm maining it this season so by the time I even play the others I should have bought most pieces for bright dust.
---
The key mold is still locked behind the forge unlocking questline. But since the questline was removed and you can't start it you can't get it. We just have to wait till Bungie fixes it and we can get our Izanagi's Burden.
---
you underestimate my power
---
I’ll admit it’s powerful but it’s NO WHERE NEAR as powerful as you say it is. You fail to see how you’re wrong because you refuse to accept that anyone can be right except YOU. Bungie put oem mask in to be a powerful crucible exotic for titans because they had no decent exotics for pvp at the time. They made it this way ON PURPOSE. STOP BITCHING.
---
you're welcome.
---
I did that as often as I could but after I have a small gambling addiction with Xur and fated engrams so I my funds only went so far
---
If killing the Vanguard is how we get their guns then ikora can get the fuck outta here I want my invective.
---
Bless.
---
I had two rampage specs, but on my weapons. I can’t simply get a permanent copy of it by dismantling one of weapons and getting the Mod back that way?
---
Ghost with +10% xp buff. Ladybug is the one I use. The eververse silver moon ghost has it, as does the preorder digital delux perk. I think the arc ghost from a couple seasons back also has it. If you are a new lighter you may not have one.
---
... Not byf...
---
Bruh what it’s amazing, literally broken in pve and pvp it can get 4k’s no problem
---
Me every time I mount mid air on my Scooty Puff Jr (Micro Mini). Except for the maniacal laughter as I spin out of control and take out an unsuspecting fallen.
---
Memento mori is one of the better weapon damage buffs since you can just reload after your last memento mori shot (if it’s a kill) and reprock memento mori, and firefly is always good to have
---
How long between melee charges?
---
As if he replied without reading lol
---
Sadly game cannot differentiate. It pisses me off when I am getting kicked of the server in mid of gambit match while not having any internet issues and getting that screensplash about how I left match intentionally.
---
I feel that. 
---
Im playing all once awhile for bright dust bouties but im enjoying my hunter too. Just gotta get that season grind on lol
---
I see. I just had a bunch of the black armory specs on my weapons and thought I could get them back by dismantling the weapon. So then I could have them in the 2.0 reusable form. But when I dismantled my weapons the mods just disappeared. Is that a bug? Or is it meant to not give back mods any more?
---
It’s part of forsaken, you get the quest for it after finishing the forsaken story so you’ll need that dlc
---
Keep in it man, I got the majority from grinding and it took me rough roughly 10-15 hours so if you’ve got the commitment keep at it. I’ll worn you though that the grinding may take a while but the ascendant level you have it beat after the grind is frustrating beyond comparison
---
Yeah I’ve noticed the same. It’s only happened to me when upgrading armour or moving my cursor through mods
---
I’m about LL 906, and is there anyway to get one without spending money?
---
"He is too dangerous to be kept alive!"
---
???
---
I know because they bring up their ghosts and leave and sometimes say crap in the team chat about there teammates
---
It wouldn't bother me so much if it didn't happen as much as it does and I shouldn't have to play in stacks to just have fun in quickplay
---
I also was an idiot and didn’t do a single boon of opulence so I had no discount which I regret
---
My current name is crippling depression
---
This could be the hook to a rap song and it wouldn't even be weird
---
The "imma drop a god roll to some someone who doesn't use shotguns" shotgun
---
god when i first saw him pop his hammer...
---
Every. Fucking. Time.  
---
  
---
Stop feeding the enemy team kills!!
---
Mountaintop season 5 get nade launcher kills.
---
: Bungie You fool you have no idea what you just stepped into you mere mortal.
---
I don't deserve this gun.
---
Youre the pleb over here
---
Bingo Bungo
---
Yes they removed the rewards from the vanilla campaigns. Not sure why they did or or why they didn't give a reason to. (they kind of suck any way so you're not missing out on much)
---
You make the next key with a key mold but it's unobtainable right now until bungie fixes it.
---
Whats the weapon? Not the launcher, the pulse rifle I guess?
---
Powerful, borderline broken. There are plenty of people who think it needs to be nerfed not just me. Just click around. The thing is stupid. 
---
I fail to see how it isn't. I lost a comp game against a team of OeM Titans with Erentil. It's a bullsh*t exotic. If that isn't evidence of it than you are just a delusional as the people who think they have skill for using it.
---
I was thinking Xol lol
---
If you preordered digital delux, the eris ghost has it. If you are a brand new player, at this stage no. Unless one rolls round in the bright dust section of eververse.
---
If you are an existing player, check your ghosts. One may have it.
---
I thought this was a skyrim screenshot for some reason.
---
30 seconds
---
*Bungie *sips drink* I'll keep this going. I got time *sips drink* and plenty of refills *sips drink* How are you?
---
After long thinking, my guess is the lost sector on the tangled shore, the shipyard
---
Poor guy downvoted for asking a question.
---
I'm stuck at doing the corrupted quest :p I just simply cant solo it and no one in d2 discord cant help either because no one is stuck at that quest other than me.
---
It's a common (white) gun now. The mission also shows up under a blue quest banner on the EDZ
---
Well to be perfectly honest, I think a lot of OHSA would be moot IRL, if we didn't suffer fall damage.
---
And it will not stay among us for long.
---
Its been a struggle to get the obsidian crystal ):
---
Kill the Wizards that spawn first For both standard and prime, the longer the match goes the more damage multipliers you get that increase the amount of damage you do.  Hit a point around 4-6x where heavy ammo or super can melt a prime in a few hits.
---
Well that’s a bummer, is there anyway I can get the exp booster?
---
WILL SOMEONE GET THIS GUARDIAN HIS CROWN!!
---
Think you have to have 4-5 people all from the same clan
---
I have to yet to find a good scout rifle since my first Nameless Midnight...
---
I believe I can fly plays in the background after 5 seconds
---
Hey its because its Available for  free and also on steam that's how I came to know this game joined destiny 2 not more than week ago
---
