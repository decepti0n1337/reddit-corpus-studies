They'll be hosted on Steam. VAC is a little overzealous when it comes to cheating anyway as I understand. I think we'll be ok.
---
---
---
Still don't understand why there's no indication anywhere in game that even says events can be made heroic.
---
Currently trying to unlock the green runes just for this reason. I'm tired of Luna's. Is Austringer better than Better Devils?
---
Loads today
---
Link me to something where i understand every heroic event thing please.
---
Too bad you have to buy them.
---
Pc ?
---
Oh that's a nice one! Love the look.
---
It shouldn't be that hard, the **vast** majority of people who started playing D2 early actually ended up quitting around the first DLC's release or shortly after, so basically everyone here now is either a new player who joined after that time, or a returning player who managed to muddle through just fine.
---
Xbox? My man.
---
Yeet
---
&gt;They haven't beaten the story of Forsaken yet
---

---
This would be the problem. The criteria according to the Bungie website are to be level 50 and finish the Forsaken campaign.
---
Me: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to go to bed early tonight.‚Äù
---
Me at 3am:
---
YEETer of Worlds
---
Thank you very much!
---
Be gone, THOT!
---
Hahahah lol i love opulence but shadowkeep put me in a "opulence u look like shit rn"
---
Will this only be for steam or on every console/platform?
---
its really not that serious of a thing. i just said they were gimmicky lol climb down from your high horse there, bud.
---
Maybe add some video effects like saturation or contrast effects. That would look cool as thorn has a nice green glow that could be taken advantage of with glow effects and what not.  Very nice though
---
New exotic sniper: The Kraber
---
I've looked all over the PlayStation store, and I can't find Forsaken anywhere. On the internet, any link I click to buy forsaken on the PlayStation store leads to Shadowkeep preorder. Does that include forsaken too?
---
Amen brother
---
Quickly hijacks the dreadnought and crashes it into the shadowkeep. 
---
" haunt that. Bi***"
---
do them all. half of those reward you with an exotic and im making the assumption that you dont have them on other characters based on your question. 
---
MUST COMPLETE ALL THE QUESTS!
---
You can try to play solo but the game really encourages you to play with others. Most of the good stuff requires a fireteam and doesn't have matchmaking. You *can* do it but it's gonna be really tough
---
Gotta have The Last Word dont ya?
---
the man who wrote this thing is absolutely insane
---
this thing doesn't die
---
yeah! they just need to finish the invitation quest
---
What are you trying to figure out? Cause all I see is some promo ad
---
Unpopular opinion but dropping a DLC without story doesn‚Äôt count as content.
---
They showed a mock-up of their cross save in the vidoc. Basically right now your Bungie account will show each platform as a different set of guardians. Once cross save is implemented you will pick one system to be your main guardians and that is what you will see when you log into your destiny characters regardless of which platform you play on. 
---
For example I have a PS account with my main 3 guardians and a Bnet account with 1 guardian and minimal playtime. I will be choosing my PS guardians to be my main account and when I buy shadowkeep on Steam, and log in with Bungie ID , my 500+ hour set of guardians from PS will be there to greet me. 
---
More info on specifics should be coming later in the summer and fully implemented prior to Shadow keep‚Äôs launch.
---
Thanks Stannis, glad to see you out and about
---
Stuff like if it was exclusive or something to like GameStop or how many there are.
---
Oh snap that interesting thanks for the info!
---
I've played against deicyide twice. Gg'd him and he responded thanks for supporting his channel. I killed him once but his team destroyed us both times
---
Played solo since it came out and enjoy it a lot. Needed help a few times for things like the whisper mission, but other than raids I can do almost all content solo. 
---
Really wish nightfall had matchmaking though :/
---
Thank you that helps a lot.
---
N is for the word they call you when they forget to shoot the damn plates on Gauntlet
---
Oh dang that‚Äôs interesting thanks for the info!
---
[deleted]
---
Lazy as fuck.  Couldn‚Äôt even make them look like guardians?
---
I feel like that would be too coincidental for it not to be on purpose XD
---
Every retailer had their own promotional material.  If you want something like that you‚Äôd have to contact the retailers and see if they have anything like that in the back getting all dusty
---
&gt; oh goody, *two* blues!
---
Lol it literally tells you right there

We don't know anything at all about Shadowkeep and the ambiguous other "stuff" it comes with.
---
Borderlands 3 is going to take absolutely all of my attention at least until I beat the main story, maybe until I 100% it.
---
It's an old MMO tradition, dps players suck at dodging everything except your heals
---
I would've stayed to do that but I needed the milestone done for my third character as I wont be back on till reset so I ended up leaving. Of course when I went back to playlist it gave me Corrupted strike for real as it does like 90% of the time now. It's become the new Exodus Crash for me
---
I have this tic that anytime anyone says garbage in the chat, I block them...it's a blacklist word for me.

The aurora borealis? At this time of day, at this time of year, in this longitude on earth, localized entirely within your jump ship?
---
Well honestly don‚Äôt you to make it heroic you leave the area and come back 5 minutes later?
---
If you're playing solo in Gambit it sucks balls. If you okay with a team it is super fun. If you're playing with a team and you still hate it, then I guess you're boned. If not, get a team and coordinate. You'll have that bow in no time. Especially if it's Prime. You get guys in full gear sets and you can fuck the other team pretty quickly if you play to your gear set's strengths.
---
Oh fuck off and take my upvote with you
---
me and my close friends have this thing where if someone in the party gets annoying we‚Äôll be like ‚Äúsoccer ball?‚Äù bc you kick soccer balls and if we say yes whoever‚Äôs party it is kicks them

They all give you powerful gear

---
Here are the ones I use regularly for pretty much every game mode, an amount of it is personal preference so here‚Äôs mine. Let me know if you‚Äôd like more info on how to get any of these.
---
Kinetic: Midnight Coup (Hand Cannon), Threat Level (Shotgun), Outbreak Perfected (Exotic Pulse Rifle), Blast Furnace (Pulse Rifle), Breakneck (Auto Rifle)
---
Energy: Ikelos_SG (Solar Shotgun), The Ringing Nail (Solar Auto Rifle), Age Old Bond (Void Auto Rifle), Jotunn (Exotic Solar Fusion Rifle), Lord of Wolves (Exotic Solar Shotgun), Riskrunner (Exotic Arc SMG)
---
Power: Hammerhead (Void Machine Gun), One Thousand Voices (Exotic Solar Fusion Rifle), The Prospector (Exotic Arc Grenade Launcher), Thunderlord (Exotic Arc Machine Gun), Whisper of the Worm (Exotic Solar Sniper Rifle), The Legend of Acrius (Exotic Arc Shotgun)
---
Already had it
---
The only things not accessible to do solo are Rat King and the one that gives you Acrius. Everything else you can, and should do.
---
This is coming from someone who only plays solo unless absolutely necessary (Raids, Rat King).
---
r/cursedcomments
---
I have absolutely no idea what I'm watching.
---
Eater is probably the easiest, then scourge after that.
---
I've seen many awesome, hilarious, cool and shitty videos/memes on Destiny 2. Yours take the cake!
---
Great capture buddy! Continue on...
---
Sad and happy.
---
Lunafactions is good, but only when you reach the boss encounter
---
The hive fortress on the moon with Earth and the travler above it with "Moon's Haunted" written across it is my pc background. Thank you for your service.
---
Apart from Rat King and On the Comms, everything can be done solo. Why not do them?
---
Also, you don't need clans or friends for raids and that kind of shit. You need to look for groups and there are many ways you can do so. (Companion app, firereams on reddit, Xbox Lfg, PS communities etc.). And i usually ask for quest specific steps while playing raids with them.
---
If you want to know the steps of some quests you can go to r/DestinyTheGame and use the search bar. Or just google it.
---
i would love it if destiny would add a system that allows you to change your characters look and gender after you've created him..... i've made a character that i now dont want
---
We‚Äôll probably get 2 shaders a week from eververse.
---
 First you took our ghaul, woke up the traveler and now all I hear in the streets are how you and your clan are making a difference
---
daily bounties for that area. easy 30~90 mats.
---
If it‚Äôs the step where you need to earn Spider‚Äôs trust, you need to complete 5 of his daily bounties
---
It was answered in their stream but the jist is its not important any time soon.
---
I‚Äôll try that. It doesn‚Äôt say that though. Just says pay him off. Cheers mate.
---
Nice man, congrats!
---
That's a great meme format. Did we never use this before?
---
Join a clan.
---
probably coz you woke the hive

Id like dual sawed off shotguns like the ones uldren has with maybe short range and wide spread or low dmg for balance.

I went with power and efficency 2 as quickly as possible. Thanks to that I've got all 3 rune slots unlocked, as well as red and green runes. Thanks to the weird chest reset yesterday, I might get blue ones too before the end of the week when I use the 3 consumables.

Can I get a link to the moons haunted thing I‚Äôm out of the loop
---
F2P for Year 1 content. Menagerie is Y2 content
---
YEEEEEEEEEEEEES
---
Yeah I saw the tweet. But like. Why is the moon haunted lol? Is it just some random shit this dude tweeted and now it‚Äôs a meme or was there some discovery that was made that led to that tweet?

Ah okay thanks
---
Same with my clan. I culled fifty from mine cos they were never on the game in a year. Out of the remaining 50 it looks like il be keeping around 7.
---
Moons haunted.
---
Excuse me?
---
You get it
---
üôèüèº
---
[removed]
---
That would be dumb
---
Yea new light level maxes at like 750. I pick it up for about $40 and haven‚Äôt found it worth it. If only I had help on PS4 in Crucible.
---
Sedia : Wait..that's illegal .... you can't nova and tether ..... AAAArghh! ( High pitch scream) .
---
Why does every vape shop have an xbox in it now
---
That‚Äôs something I can get behind.
---
Yes gears 5 as well. They said we can get gears 5 on sept 10th but if we get game pass we can get it 4 days early. Might be worth it just to get it out of the way
---
Whoa does your mom know your saying that because you might get in trouble. Don‚Äôt worry little boy you‚Äôll learn.
---
Had to do zero hour. Poor dude kept getting stuck on the fans part. After 4 hours I decided to dip out and finished it with another guy.
---
Needs to be gamepass ultimate just FYI, but then if you pay for GP monthly anyway I can't see why you wouldn't get ultimate.
---
I've seen 1 or 2 people survive by being directly behind the sentinel. It looks like you got to be literally hugging his rear end though.
---
Shoot didnt know that. Otherwise gears is on the 10th, with borderlands 13th and destiny 17th. Thats some super close together games
---
The black armory was a grind fest for weapons that were soon outdated, season of the drifter was total cancer cause you were forced to play gambit where idiot teammates invade and just die, and season of opulence is literally the most hated area in the game expanded
---
I don't mean this to sound rude but soloing t3's isn't terribly difficult since I hit 700. Perhaps a better build or safer tactics during the run would be advisable?
---
Does anyone know how server hopping will work going forward?  Because i m a little scared on this one. I m in eu, but i m mainly playing on na since na has like 50000000 x the amount of players, especially on lfg.  On battlenet client you simply go on "change server"  but steam does not have this kind of feature, you cant simply change server on steam.
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
Orpheus with tether, Ophidia Spathe with 1k cuts, and nighthawk with bottom tree gg
---
When two walls are sent side by side, one is slightly ahead of the other. The gap between is enough to run through.
---
Yea they're making the base game f2p. All the expansions still Have to be bought
---
The armor and weapon nerfs actually didn't change a *single* thing significantly. That's why you found nothing. 
---
Everything that worked before still works now, it's just that for the "riven cheese" god rolled grenade launchers work better than cluster bombs. Cluster bombs still work.
---
Same, I love the Thornament, looks used and battle proven. But I'd love it to have the original Thorns' colours.
---
That wouldn't count as precision damage, tether and melting point just make enemies take more damage, not expand their crit spots
---
That drawing actually was put on this Reddit shortly after the tweet; the artist has made a post here about it as well. 
---
It was a funny drawing that ironically turned out to be precognition.
---
I started using a sniper rifle for crucible only because of this, and after many games I have killed an amazing three people. One was a headshot, which I have no idea how it happened, and two were body shots. Usually I fire just too late and then my head is atomised by some other sniper firing from the next town over. I'm sick of hearing that splrch noise when your head explodes, lol.
---
I don't like the legs or body of the set :b. I only use the helmet but it's a damn sexy helmet!
---
Someone turn this into a drawing. PLEASE. This is gold.
---
Dunno man, light scaling makes sense to me, keeps the game interesting I guess. Anything below a boss gets 1 to 2 clipped at most anyway more often than not.
---
Worth the wait
---
Spawns fine.
---
I hate that damn event.
---
If you can beat phase two, you can beat the raid.
---
First encounter is easy, second is a jumping puzzle with checkpoints.
---
Third is rough, but not as rough as Ghalran. Get a sword and go to town.
---
The jacket is $150 you sure you want it?
---
Ikr, I never used snipers in crucible... I suck at them.. It always feels like my headshots never count and enemy never flinches
---
Ok nice!
---
SGA
---
I sincerely hope Bungie gives you some kind of mention of this joke in the game. You've taken a mild chuckle on Twitter and turned it into a meme movement with a single comic (now two!)
---
I did the whole raid a few days back and we used outbreak for everything minus riven, on her prospector lol.
---
DPS phase, time to kill myself.
---
Thank you! I‚Äôve been looking for this kind of explanation :D
---
Sorry for bothering y‚Äôall
---
As far as I know yea you get the story and everything instantly. BUT, as I see there is no Forsaken in all of this...
---
That means that you might need too pay a little extra
---
Lost sector: "Im Pregnant"
---
I have everything unlocked to tier 2 and the 3 slots lol. I don't know how people are struggling so much, especially when they gave us double the chests at this point. Do some triumphs folks!
---
Look who‚Äôs lurkin around
---
Yes
---
oh i think i'd shit a chicken if they did that honestly. i have dmg04 who retweeted my reposting (to twitter) of it and cozmo who made it his twitter banner and frankly that already made me flip out a little bit when i found that out.
---
Gotta grow a dank jacket from strength
---
That is...truly horrifying.
---
yes!
---
What sniper is it?
---
duuuuude that really must‚Äôve sucked
---
For the annual pass you need Forsaken.  As far as I know it used to be separate but now need to buy the complete collection which is now the same price as Forsaken was.  The game will only download required pieces not the whole game or 1st year dlcs which are now free.
---
Do you own curse of Osiris and the war mind dlc
---
Holy fuck talk about a dejav√∫ moment. I‚Äôve dreamt this exact same post with the follow-up comments in order before. Lol wtf is going on!?
---
You need forsaken
---
Beloved.
---
Moons haunted
---
Spare rations any good?
---
Ahhh thanks, in my head forsaken was the same as the annual pass so I thought the money I would spend on the complete collection would be a waste. Many thanks.
---
So if you download complete collection and buy the annual pass you would have the complete game to this point until Shadowkeep.
---
Love the d1 warlock helmet
---
Thank you!
---
With a God roll yes. (Range + rapid hit + multi kill clip)
---
HOLY SHIT THATS AUSTIN MY CLANMATE
---
Subsistence is arguably the worst perk introduced recently.
---
NaNi??!?!
---
Persistence is the key . Watch some guides for tips and tricks.
---
I don't have it, but a clan mate does. He says it's very good. He plays a ton so it was bound to happen, so I can't say if it's worth it, but he enjoys it.
---
Does anybody know what the biggest score difference has been?
---
That‚Äôs not what the ornament is! &gt;:(
---
Did that wizard come from the moon?
---
Callus' Treasured! Also has the recluse ornament on it, but it looks great even without the ornament!
---
6 minutes???
---
Its broken?
---
As a person who used to be strictly PvE I got recluse last season. Eventually even with all your losses you will pick up some tricks and things in PvP and you‚Äôll make some headway. 
---
And yes the snipe gods put us in our place, but even those guys started somewhere. I finished the headshot section of the Revoker requirements yesterday, but trust me, I had a bunch of misses on my way to that point.
---
Good luck guardian !
---
Is it always after 2 damage phases? Sounds like a hidden time limit. Are you trying to solo this? Cause I have never not 1 phased this guy.
---
Use fireteam medallions and grind heroic events. Doing bounties and milestones helps too. If you‚Äôre at 30, I assume you haven‚Äôt done the forsaken campaign yet. Do that.
---
My first ever exotic earned from raiding in D1
---
Danger will Robinson
---
Any tips man? Im up to like 73 percent but im only getting like 1 a game, sometimes none if my team gets steamrolled. It is really bad.
---
See that's not how you do it. 
---
Use it as if it was the surprised pikachu anyway, stretch and crop the photo to emphasize the meme, and everyone will get it.
---
whats TT?
---
Where is the invitation quest?
---
If I currently have only 1 character, should I create 2 more to receive the 690 gear?
---
Top-Tree, sorry
---
Leave them to me, i need gl kills for the Mountaintop üòÇüòÇ
---
I used to be a nezarecs sin main, but I never really noticed a big change in regen speed, even though I used void weapons. Was it buffed recently?
---
Just wait until it says 100% but still not complete... soooo close....
---
WHAT IS THAT? WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?! PRIVATE PYLE!!!!!
---
they‚Äôre already back, you can find them in strikes and i think crucible, but definitely strikes
---
You on console or PC? I finished the raid days ago but never claimed anything, when I get home later from work I'll MSG ya.
---
Got sun shot catalyst on crucible on the first week btw
---
Just the fact that I call Izanagi‚Äòs Burden also in the game Baguette makes this meme perfect
---
Wait, Oryx is back?
---
*Ah, shit. Here we go again.*
---
I really think binge should answer these burning questions how will I know how to best burn out my tv speakers
---
Time to kill him for the third time
---
F
---
Then you can talk to Werner who is in Benedict‚Äôs old spot in the tower under Hawthorne.  Need to finish forsaken to now talk to Benedict in the annex.
---
Honestly, I want a raid where you see the Levithian eat Nessus
---
What are catalysts? (Sorry kinda new to Destiny 2)
---
No. It doesn‚Äôt
---
What is that and why did you do it?
---
Several times my Warlock spawns without the bottom half of the robes and it looks sick. I'd like that togglable.
---
Definitely an arc wielder in that craft.
---
they looked alive before and after, what did you debunk? i'm confused.
---
From what I've heard, it doesn't count unfortunately :(
---
Fair enough, I see how it would become unbalanced for PvE. I guess my question still stands on what the game can't keep my interest. On paper it seems right up my alley. But from the down votes on the post I can see this question isn't exactly welcome.
---
Yeah, Commander Lilith and the battle for Sanctuary is free until the 9th of next month.
---
Just throwing it out there.
---
Noticed that while ago  on my sniper some times it shows the correct planet.. Sometimes its random... Damn bungie you rng-ed that too lol :(
---
Yeah I‚Äôm on Bannerfall here

Pick a lore book not mentioned below, go to YouTube, search ‚Äò&lt;insert lore book&gt; guide‚Äô, copy what they do in the video until you‚Äôve picked up all the collectibles.
---
For the Variks book, farm Lost Sectors in Tangled Shore during the week that Tangled Shore is Flashpoint. 
---
For the dreaming city book, farm lost sectors in Dreaming City whenever you like.
---
For the Gambit book, just play Gambit. There is one secret triumph (there may be more), which requires you to invade, grab 3 enemy motes from the floor, and return to your side. As soon as you have the motes just run and hide. 
---
For the Cayde book, just open world chests or run ‚ÄòAce in the Hole‚Äô if it‚Äôs a daily story mission.
---
For Truth to Power, you can get a lore piece each full curse week by giving the oracle an offering then open the chest. You can glitch a second by giving the offering a few minutes before weekly reset and opening the chest after reset happens, then doing the usual offering on a different character.
---
That should be it. If I missed any let me know.
---
Hmmm, I dunno. How does it hold up to Age of Triumph? Hows the pop on PC? Me and a person whose actively plays at endgame already are just waiting for a full edition on Steam so I can get cracking.
---
The funny thing is... I play with Chaos Reach Warlock :V
---
Was this actually said? I saw a comic but I missed the live stream and haven‚Äôt got a chance to watch

-You talk funny Nash. Where you from?
---
-Lots of different places.
---
I was going to guess titan considering Pikachu‚Äôs headbutt attack.
---
‚ÄúYou disgust me, filthy jar man!‚Äù
---
Yes but I‚Äôm talking about the chalice upgrade talking about a ‚Äúrare chance of imperials dropping from playlist activities.‚Äù
---
The Wealth of the Emperor buff wasn‚Äôt an issue for me, but what I‚Äôm wondering is about drop rates when that‚Äôs not active, according to the upgrade description.
---
WE'VE WOKEN THE SALT!
---
same as shield bash I accidentally found out when panicking
---
I was assuming it was like 5-10% with none of the Werner buffs I had them drop 3 times in 5 comp matches and 3 gambits
---
How
---
This was even funnier cause I just bypassed the underlying text and looked at the guardian like ‚Äúwhy does he look so weird‚Äù
---
How many imperials dropped for you when they did? That‚Äôs something else I‚Äôve been wondering about.
---
500 every time, a nice fat reward
---
If ur on ps4 you go to settings then account management and restore licences I think. Not home to check rn but If ur on Xbox I have no clue just Google it. Might as well Google it anyway because I don't exactly remember
---
Well that‚Äôs good at least, I‚Äôll keep playing hopefully get something to drop. That makes a lot of sense why people are finishing their chalices already.
---
Unless you want to infuse it later. If power level is the one and only thing you care about, then I guess you don't need anything else, but bear in mind that various activities do require more of you than power level, such as guns that are able to do a certain amount of damage.
---
cant xbox and pc crossplay cuz windows 10 and xbox are both microsoft or somethingüòÇ
---
Lol
---
My first clear last week I asked our clan leader "okay so I heard there is something about hitting the paw and shooting the eyes in a certain order".
---
His response was something like "yeeahh no... just pull out a Prospector and we are all gonna shoot it in the mouth at the same time."
---
I‚Äôve been saving lol, if your willing to then definitely
---
Thx. Having a hard time remembering. Do you infuse to take perks from one gun and move it to another? I had good gear when I stopped and I know I was hoarding stuff.
---
Meh sure idc il give you the code but can I have the store emblem code?
---
Lemme know if it works bruh
---
The only thing infusion changes is power level. You sacrifice the higher power level item and transfer its *exact* power level to the lower power level item.
---
We don't know.
---
To be fair, if you are facing a sniper, you usually see the tiny red light from where they are. That's your cue to grfo of there.
---
i lick the higher-ups toes for it
---
You're\*

Holy shit, I‚Äôm not even going to read this but I will say this. GET A FUCKING LIFE DUDE YOU‚Äôre a JOKE. Your mom should‚Äôve swallowed you.

I just wanted a fun RPG shooter with good optimization/function :(
---
Anthem failed at the optimization/function point when I had to change my hardware mouse sensitivity, and I lost sound multiple times in beta and full release. Once I got past that, it failed the ‚Äúfun‚Äù part because I had to open the tomb lol.
