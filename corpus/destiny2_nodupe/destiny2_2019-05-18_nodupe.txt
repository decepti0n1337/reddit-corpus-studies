It took me longer than I want to admit to realize this was a joke.
---
---
---
Acrius is good against the ogre boss and I use Riskruner against Dul Incaru, it makes that encounter way easier.
---
Any machine gun can kill her if all three knights are dead
---
Yeah I agree the whisper needed to be brought down. All encounters needed to be balanced around that weapon which kills variety in raid loadouts.
---
Join the Destiny 2 PC LFG; they have channels dedicated for certain activities (raids included), not to mention they have a sherpa channel
---
Nobody uses one eyed mask with whisper
---
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
---
There‚Äôs a lot of Destiny lore, so I hope you‚Äôve got plenty of time,
---
It's probably because one of their new raid mechanics are designed like trash they made sure you couldn't use sleeper to cheese it
---
This was very enjoyable to read.
---
Is this not a spoiler?
---
That's awesome
---
When did you realize?
---
And at end if the day we still play .. soo yea .. profit
---
Absolutely ridiculous...theyre nerfing everything to the point those items will become completely useless. They destroyed Shards few months ago with ridiculous nerf and it became completely useless and now theyre nerfing it even? For what fking reason? Ursa Furiosa? After they nerfed it months ago I havent seen a single person use it anywhere and now theyre nerfing it again? Whats even the point of having those exotics in the game?
---
Congratulations!!
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt get why they thought it would work without change the second time around?
---
Best part is all the time dumped into getting them...
---
Nothing can match Destiny's community though. No other game even comes close when it comes to looter shooters with PvP, PvE, PvPvE, and raids/dungeons.
---

---
This is coming from someone who loved Borderlands for what it was, but unless they seriously expand the game, like adding more game modes besides single player and coop, it won't scratch that itch (also no armor! Like c'mon!) 
---
Just the raiding and pulling off the dungeons alone is just so great. I haven't even raided that much (very busy these days, management sucks your soul out of your balls), but I can remember every raid and every dungeon I've beaten. They're just so good!
---
If I can somehow find the time, I'll definitely be playing Borderlands 3. But I just don't have the time anymore to play multiple games all that often, and I don't see Borderlands adding much in terms of game modes.
---
It's scary how accurate this is.
---
In multiple videos he has disputed this idea. He has no need to to talk up Bungie, his only interest is in making great YouTube videos. He has criticized Bungieany times about their actions in destiny. He just has a better view for the overall game and can understand why Bungie would want to do these things to make the overall game interesting. Just because he agrees with Bungie does not mean he's sucking up to them, just means your narrow minded.
---
EOW by far
---
Irony is this meme gets used for whatever the current dog pile is on the subreddit. So you could just use this meme on itself.
---
Thanks
---
Well bless your heart, everyone here is happy for you.
---
Releases exotic primary that can 1 phase most bosses than complain an exotic power weapon is OP ..
---
You technically don't "need" any to play the game. But if want to spend buy the Forsaken DLC. If you're still feeling good about the game after that you can buy the annual pass content. TBH I don't know if you can buy them separate. Be warned tho, the game is in a real bad place right now.
---
I say that because Bungie is nerfing everything that breathes. They're not listening to the community at all and it's just really sad to see it in the state it's in. I'm sure other people will disagree, and they get to as it's their right. I'm just personally disappointed and I know others are too.
---
Why?
---
Good argument, call everyone a shill.
---
Releases primary weapon a week ago which can 1 phase most raid bosses in the game than turns around and says Whispers so OP the only way they can fix it is by removing every exotic perk from yet yet keeping it as an exotic weapon..
---
At this point just dropping it from the exotic slot would be a buff.... I'm all for the +25% damage for each crit in a row.
---
I just want to see what they have planned, and what content we're getting before I make a judgement. They need to promote new content and make it relevant. "Season of the nerf" is funny and all, but bungie can't possibly be doing this without providing other metas to chase. Many might not agree with them but they aren't trying to kill destiny, they aren't that stupid. There will always be a cheese  for those who don't want to put forth the effort, so rest assured to whomever that concerns.
---
We should just keep retweeting this at bungo
---
Dude... it WILL be nerfed. Probably not long after most people have access to the catalyst too. I betcha bottom dollar on that bullshit.
---
Dude crosspost to r/DtG the devs NEED to see this, it's awesome!

Sweats In hunter...
---
There's nothing good
---
Sweats In hunter
---
So true.  Most of the destiny streamers are a bunch of bungie apologists and brown nosers.
---
The funniest part imo is that Spectral Blades is already dead and Gwisin gets nerfed anyways.
---
I get that it‚Äôs consistent with all the other super-generating nerfs, but c‚Äômon that horse is dead.
---
It will cost you around $80 Canadian dollars for forsaken and the annual pass. Forsaken adds a bunch of new content and so does the animal pass. I would highly recommend if you have 80 dollars laying aroundüôÇüôÇ
---
Motw
---
I recommend forsaken as it is in my opinion the best dlc hands down. I believe it is around forty however it might have gone down
---
Lol clever
---
We will find new strategies we always do, I am not defending these nerfs but I will say we will over come these hurdles we always do.
---
Do doo doo
---
I kinda think that the changes to Shards and Ursa are more for consistency than anything else, considering that the goal of the nerfs is to reduce a player‚Äôs ability to refuel their own super and make people rely more on teammates‚Äô orbs.
---
Honestly love this video. His laugh is contagious
---
this is a good post.
---
Wow I see we have a special jimmy. Obviosly satire and making fun of how ridiculous the nerfs are. Not to mention he has a point. He spent money on something he liked that was good that got changed way later. Whisper got nerfed into the ground and to say it was still a power house of a weapon after the nerf in d1 is a bit of a stretch.
---
Interesting, I spent a bunch of time yesterday testing two fusion rifles with the exact same roll because they felt completely different. I wanted to learn the recoil pattern and the nuances of the gun so I could make it work for me. Two guns, same rolls, completely different feel. Kind of kills your argument. I mean no offense by this, but it really feels like you‚Äôre one that complains to complain. I could understand balancing complaints, lock of communication and content. But the gunplay is solid as hell.
---
Lmao the fact they shared the exact same rolls and stats as you say just proves my point about.
---
Just ignore everything they've changed for the better ok bud üëç
---
Never said they had the same stats. They had the same rolls. Different stats. Both guns have their own strengths, weaknesses and feel. How does that prove your point that all weapons are the same?
---
The music is what makes this one better. I like both but if i had to choose one, it'd be this one. Good job.
---
You don‚Äôt understand. The only thing keeping Whisper viable was its infinite ammo. Now since it pulls from reserves, we can just use DARCI and use Lunafactions or rally barricades. Whisper is useless now. We are upset that it‚Äôs exotic perk is irrelevant, not that it was a crutch that was used everywhere.
---
You can balance the game better than the idiots over at bungie üôÉ its a good read
---
Even I'm not on board with Nerfs &amp; I'm too rubbish to even own most of the weapons affected
---
Excuses me? Oh sorry didn‚Äôt know I was in the presence of your highness himself! allow me to bow
---
&gt;The next fix for the revelry duplicate thing where they are simply giving us some free armor isn't until July! 
---
Do you mean solstice if heros, the event that came out in year one before the revelry was even a thing. How is it a duplicate?
---
except that the nerf to Whisper is going to make white nail the same as in D1.
---
People have experienced D1 white nail before and don‚Äôt like it.
---
That‚Äôs experiencing the nerf.
---
Wah wah wah lol just quit then don‚Äôt come whine here over fairly minor changes
---
Looks we found another batch of angry, downvoted comments :)
---
WELCOME TO OUR WORLD BITCHES!!!
---
- Titans
---
Fuckin overrated comment. This deserves Wood.
---
If its day 3 and youre playing about 2-3 hours each day then its not really good progress
---
You ain‚Äôt better than most players till you have and completed sleeper stimulant catalyst that shit is hard and most players don‚Äôt have it
---
You just forgot thanos (bungle) smiling upon the sunset. Amazing tho
---
They weren't talking about heavy only when they said other snipes
---
I like how the community always takes it as a personal attack when something nerfed.
---
Like "bungie, why would you do this to ME?"
---
I was being somewhat facetious. But honestly I do think these nerfs are because of the season of opulence raid. I suspect that they found out that was certain armor and exotics that the rate could be done too fast.
---
I think that I will be downvoted for this, but actually this changelog contains too much contraversive notes in it. 50% super energy return? Too low. Some new perks on exotic armor just too random and sounds like those perks were made just to fill this changelog. And actually in this changelog we see only 2 different important changes away from actual TWAB, other changes are very insignificant and not very useful.
---
5 ammo and not working reserves? We'll see what you will do after getting shot from a fallen on SotP and missing precision shot.
---
Non-precision shot from Simulant damage reduce - it will make weapon like - it works only on precision shot and it's useless if your hit wasn't crit. Example - fast kill of first encounter on LW, when boss head less than scope on simulant.
---
Sturm and Drang changes - those two weapons made for each other, there's no need to make this perk working for any weapon. This duo is already powerful, and this "perk" just adds to any energy weapon autoreload, which already exists.
---
Sweet Business - actually interesting change, will have use in PvE. But how you will manage the perk stats bonus? Will it work after 1 second holding the trigger? More than 2 seconds it's already not really needed for that gun. It working too fast. We can just change the stats of weapon, it will be much more useful than this perk.
---
Graviton Forfeit - big no. It doesn't need a buff, it's already a useful exotic. Using abilities not breaking invisibility? No, you all remember revelry, and this is not good decision even without it. You can throw grenades on point without being seen, for example, this will not make this exotic better. More invisibility time? It already have good invisibility time buff, don't make it too long.
---
Ahamkara Grasps - just added graverobber to every weapon, maybe we will make a random rolling additional perk for weapon on every exotic armor? :)
---
Wormhusk - one shot from shotgun+dodge - instakill, plus possible Firefly. Plus explosion with big amount of damage if it's worked - too much, isn't it? It will make shotgun aping too useful with wormhusk.
---
Verity's Brow - you can't kill enemy with shield without removing shield. Also this buff will make ark web grenades too powerful, they already have very good range and damage.
---
Vesper of Radius - imagine warlock staying in the rift and circle of rift just constantly changes around him. Also, will need big amount of time to test normal range if this perk's enemy detection. Will require different PvP and PvE stats, when Bungie tries to make less of this differences.
---
Sanguine Alchemy - so, if you will stay in rift on Equinox with pulse rifle and/or shotgun, you will have infinite effect from Foetracer. Nice work.
---
Khepri's Horn - you can just spam with barricades on points with close quarters to stop capturing or block some directions entirely. Also will break defuse on City map with point inside the house, you can just place your barricade, it will block 2 entrances by blasts, and camp with shotgun on other sides. 4 stack will make it much more broken.
---
Helm of Saint-14 - overshied for everyone. I can just run through and go around the corner with shotgun, now no one can kill me :) Also blinding every enemy will cover too big area, where you will be instakilled.
---
Enhanced perks - more random for everyone, guardians! Random rolls system was made to increase your playtime with rolling your items. Now it much more random, and you will have to waste much more time grinding it. I don't want to play the game like this.
---
Remove Bloom - good change, but sounds like you added that just to make this changelog look good. It's like "We made the game run in 60 fps on consoles", sounds like begging for upvotes post.
---
Nerfing Orbs in Crucible - absolutely unnecessary, especially if you use bow with orpheus, it will make tether useless.
---
Pulses change - yes, make Blast Furnace campers more powerful. Nice idea.
---
This comment is just my personal opinion on this changelog, I'm not wanted to insult the author, just wanted to say why many of those changes are very controversial. And some of them looks like added just for that :) https://imgur.com/RoiR7a7.jpg
---
I hate to be that guy, but Ace came back in Sept 2018...
---
Jubilant engram secondary fix

https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/47821
---
The whisper nerf is stupid. The gun will be completely useless now. If they really wanted to nerf that thing they should‚Äôve just reduced the reserves all the way to three. That way it‚Äôs extremely unforgiving and only useful if you hit you shots.
---
It‚Äôs perk now is just a worse version of a rally barricade or Luna factions and I don‚Äôt know why anyone would use whisper over darci
---
Well hover over the catalyst for that weapon and it will tell you where to find them. Telesto Catalyst you can only get it from Prestige Eater of Worlds. Legend of acrius from prestige Leviathan and sleeper catalyst from prestige spire of stars
---
Well now would be a good time with people blundering in looking to complete the last invitation, if a scrub like me can clean house with Le Monarque anyone can.
---
I think that's the big issue. 
---
They buffed Skull SO MUCH that it became stupid not to use it. Not they've taken it away again it won't feel anywhere near as powerful - people will complain. 
---
Surely they could have seen that it was just far too easy/strong in the first place? It's crazy it made it into the game like that. Especially after they nerfed Shards + Ursa, it felt really imbalanced towards warlock. 
---
It also doesn't help that they seem to have changed their minds and now want to go back another direction. I think we would all be fine with a harder/less supers Destiny, but the other exotics need fixing/powering up at the same time.
---
what encounter design, most bosses in the game just stand around and let you attack their weak point for massive damage once you get past the initial mechanics.
---
Oh prestige raid. If only my clan would ever do one on the first place
---
I too agree with removing an iconic weapons exotic perk in favour of triple tap
---
indeed, even after the nerf people are still going to run the same armor exotics because pretty much everything else is pointless.
---
Just move a little to the side.
---
It's the SotP raid chest piece if I'm not mistaken
---
Ever done a raid before?
---
I get what you're saying,  but they also said a few months ago they were going to give us more supers. Or something to that effect. 
---
This is only my opinion, but I think skull is really fun right now. Launching a lot of nova bombs is fun. 
---
I'm not upset they are nerfing the armor, but I do feel like they are nerfing my fun.
---
Watch Dattos video on why this is a terrible idea.
---
Check if you already have one. As you only need to buy it once.
---
I just spam my edge transit and switch to a coldheart. Does allot more damage too..
---
\&gt;I'm not on board with Nerfs 
---
\&gt;I'm too rubbish to even own most of the weapons affected
---
You don't need to have an opinion on things you don't understand
---
No one said listen to everything. Unless you'd care to quote who did?
---
Well then the comment is misguided, because they do in fact implement a lot of what the community asks for, and y'all are saying they don't as soon as they do something reasonable that you're just not a fan of.
---
k
---
&gt; I understand everyone's frustration with the Super reset exotics getting nerfed, but at the same time lets all be honest with ourselves - they are way too overpowered.  
---
100% this. There's something wrong when I feel bad for not using something as broken as Skull. I don't think these exotics are going anywhere even with the nerfs, but it's a start toward making the game more interesting and less one dimensional. The fact that they nerfed Ursa is disturbing, but also interesting. Perhaps there's an encounter where shield titan is meta? 
---
All of the gun changes are good. Whisper will still serve it's purpose as the highest total damage gun in the game. LoW is actually getting a buff over all, which is surprising because it's already quite dominant. Sleeper is clearly being pre-adjusted to account for a future encounter, which is pretty cool. This means we will probably have some different boss design other than "shoot weak spot until dead.
---
Not just that. Don‚Äôt buy silver, don‚Äôt buy the next season pass... and most of all don‚Äôt play the game. Bunghole has proven they go almost solely  by their metrics... if no one plays the game, they have no metrics. Simple as that
---
Thank you
---
At least you kept it clean...ish. 
---
The inmates are running the asylum.
---
Cry some more
---
Here to tell you that Warframe did it first. Destiny can't compare to how creative Warframe is
---
Prometheus Lens used to create bullets out of nothing and then they changed it to be more fair and less broken.
---
&gt;The gun will be completely useless now. 
---
Lots of people with this opinion. Lots of people that need to learn basic game mechanics.
---
Whisper is used for it's potential total damage, being capable of outputting more damage than any other gun in the game
---
With 18 shots, it will still serve this purpose as the highest total damage gun in the game by a large margin.
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt know why anyone would use whisper over darci 
---
Then you don't understand the purpose of these guns as they serve different purposes. Whisper was never better than DARCI to begin with. You use DARCI for DPS and whisper for total damage. The same will be true after this nerf.
---
Okay, here's a list of stupid nerfs you should not feel good about supporting:  
---
LH/NF: Fire rate nerf already lower TTK, which is fine. WHen they changed the perk not to work with headshots to stop with double taps, a unicorn of an attack that would be slower already with the fire rate change, they killed it in PvE where it was useful to kill majors by shooting them in the head over and over.  
---
AoS: This nerf is bad because it's a nerf to OEM without nerfing OEM, which is overpowered. The problem with AoS isn't that it to taps with OEM, it's that it's stats are op and it has twice as many perks as any other gun.   
---
Orpheus Rig: [Shadowshot is a horribly clunky ability that doesn't have half of the utility it did in D1.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/bpqhx0/friendly_reminder_that_shadowshot_is_bad_and/) Since it fails to kill anything and is only good for CC, it should have the option to charge faster. Personally, Skull + Nova Bomb is strictly better because it kills everything, gets super back faster, and can be used on a boss, which means its super charge should be nerfed below that of the weaker Shadowshot.   
---
Whisper: Whisper isn't good. No one uses it for anything anymore. Basically every activity has a better option in the meta, most of the time being DARCI.
---
D1 one was a better shooter, D2 just doesn't feel the same.
---
Lmao Have an upvote, I also love the lost comments.
---
Yeah, people should appreciate Bungie more and not vet as much. I agree.
---
Except I've explained myself clearly and have a thread up with countless examples and many positive comments agreeing with me. You on the other hand have said absolutely nothing.
---
sunk cost fallacy still exists though
---
My entire destiny experience changed when I started using lfgs for finding raid groups. 
---
I would recommend the destiny companion app for your phone.
---
Darci has higher dps...
---
At least 13!
---
He was also one of the ones that made weekly videos for months about how bad Destiny 2 was when it came out as well.  So if he is saying he likes changes now he is being a complete hypocrite.
---
No, no matter how you look at it, nerfing weapons to force a player base to use other weapons is never ok!!! In the twab, the devs say they could buff everything but then there would be no challenging content- news flash BAD CONTENT WITH BAD WEAPONS IS STILL BAD CONTENT rather you nerf weapons or not
---
The final boss of the first Raid in Destiny 1, Vault of Glass
---
Only 90's kids will remember.
---
It'll put you at the tower like you've just finished Warmind and Osiris. Then all you have to do is Forsaken to get up to level 50 and you can start doing fun stuff
---
True. But whisper has more sustained DPS as long as you hit all your crits
---
Oh ok cool so from spawn at the tower I'll find a quest marker and just plow through that. Thanks dude. Anything gear and weapons wise I should chase first?
---
I think VoG boss
---
An f*
---
Yeah u need 8 whispered breathing shots to kill her but people also uses whisper to kill the knights. So you have to find a way to kill all 3 without whisper.
---
I tried to post it there but got blocked by automod unfortunately. Talked to an actual mod and he approved my post since it was high effort, but that was 4 hours too late so I was buried under 4 hours of posts and only got 2 upvotes there and zero comments
---
I haven't watched Infinity War, and was sure AF this music is from original movie before looking through comments section.
---
It fits so well.
---
R/pyrocinical
---
Very true, bungie managed to piss literally everyone off
---
Don't even feel like farming any new weapon, they'll just be nerfed to the ground anyway. GJ Devs
---
I played the thorn end mission last night with a guy using ursas, and he, literally, not figuratively, got 7 supers each with less than 15 seconds of wait time between the last one ending and his next one starting. He produced around 50 orbs for me and my friend. 
---
These types of things have to be considered when trying to understand the balance. 
---
Maybe we're going to fight a massive shrieker in the next raid...
---
Or we could *not* let bungie continually get away with pointless bullshit.
---
  
---
Seriously, y'all just love getting kicked around.
---
You typo'd nerf into nerd on your main post and I think he was pointing it out is all, not calling you one lol
---
What are you referring to, the new subclasses or the daily/weekly challenges?
---
It's a shame that borderlands is the only real hope here. The physics and shooting don't feel good, it's silly and sophomoric at its attempts at humor, and after the final dlc drops 6-9 months after release the game is effectively dead. No pvp, no new game modes, just campaign then boss grinds. I love looter shooters, and there was a time when I had fun with borderlands  but I've grown past it. Couple that with epic exclusivity which just puts a bad taste in my mouth and Randy pitchford just being a general asshat, bl3 is going to have to do something absolutely amazing to make me want to play it.
---
it's worse than triple tap as it doesn't give any free ammo back
---
It's become useless. I rarely saw someone with it as it was, now it'll become completely obsolete.
---
This ^ He's just a kiss ass trying to stay in Bungies good side in hopes of getting a position there with his butt buddy holtzman
---
I don't think splitting the playerbase of a playlist with a low population is a good idea, matchmaking will take ages
---
Oh wait I‚Äôm sorry i thought you meant Combat Style I was changing the name. No pathways give you your subclass. Dark path gives you radiation, dark matter, and voltage subclasses while Guardian pathways give you your arc, void, and solar subclasses. Exiles are like suits that run off of arc energy, void energy, and solar energy.
---
From the Gambit Prime Class Item Lore Tabs. 
---
Minor correction it was 5 other Ghosts. 
---
After the Light was suppressed by the Red Legion and Drifter was stuck on the Planet with the light-draining things he was forced to kill the 3 remaining memebers of his crew.
---
This caused Drifters Ghost, who had hoped that Drifter would at some point start acting like a Guardian, to snap and devise a Plan that allowed them to replicate the energy that held some of the Things in stasis.
---
They hunted the other Ghosts and Drifter combined them. Afterwards his Ghosts eye was red, he could no longer speak but he was able to tap into new spectrums of Light and even to other energies including the Darkness.
---
They then froze every single one of the things they could find and cobbled together a ship (The Derelict) and escaped
---
That is also the origin of the Banks and Motes of Dark you use in Gambit.
---
I was literally JUST loaded into a 3v4 FROM THE START
---
Whisper overrated anyway
---
You mean like changing during a match. If so yea you just have to upgrade each path to do so.
---
That's one of the things i thought about. Making it both is also another idea, although you'd need to bring the damage down a bit. You could then run both Whisper and Tractor Cannon though, which would kind of make it a raid go to combo... i dunno. I think they definitely need to change it to something else, even though i do kind of understand why they nerfed it.
---
As sad as I am to see skull go it's the only nerf I feel was actually justfied lmao
---
What?
---
SRL was honestly a nice and refreshing change of pace. I really do miss it considering there's so many goddamn sparrow now.
---
Can you quit going around every post on this subject and being a sourpuss about stuff? I don't know who pissed in your corner flakes, but you need to cool it
---
Yeah I have no clue what this post is asking either.
---
That's true, but I mean it makes you wonder: why is the population of it so low to begin with? Is it perhaps that the mode is riddled with ridiculous flaws?  They really just need to fix it as a whole and then people might actually enjoy it again and put the time and effort into playing it
---
I was thinking about that and I guess you could.
---
Y1
---
So drifter was stuck in the planet during the whole red campaign? How long did the red war last according to lore?  He fuzed the ghosts to protect the light from getting to the things right?
---
Bungie: You can only equip 1 exotic weapon and 1 exotic armour piece
---
Also Bungie: Exotics are now weaker than legendaries.
---
No one cares and this is also a good way to get yourself banned for spamming subs, nice
---
I think that whisper should get 2 sets of infinite ammo and then get put on a 2 minute timer until you can get more ammo. This timer also starts if you miss a shot after your first set of infinite ammo,
---
I didn't realize. Thank you again!
---
Side effects of Last Word and Thorn quest eh?
---
I thought those were Tediore guns?
---
Do you work for Bungie? If not.. boy do I have a career for you
---
Actually I think Aztecross made a good suggestion, keep the 18 ammo, but have it pull from reserves UNTIL your last 3 shots. So if you nail the last 3 shots you get rewarded with more ammo.
---
Moira: I did it before it was cool
---
Goku: b*tch please
---
Congrats you just launched a slow ball of death towards the last city
---
Thanus
---
No point in asking him out he‚Äôs taken
---
Whisper's nerf is completely stupid tho. An exotic weapon whose perk can be replaced by lunafaction boots or a rally barricade? 5 weeks of grinding for such a stupid perk?
---
I wish they changed it in any other way. Make it infinite ammo again, but 3 shots at its maximum capacity and can't be increased in any way, so missing just one shot makes it useless again. Or something, dunno, but not the proposed change. It's useless like that.

MULTIPLAYER Game, not a singleplayer game with multi
---
Better hurry up before it gets nerfed.
---
The worst feeling known to man
---
People who argue in favor of infinite ammo guns that make solo‚Äôing raid encounters possible make me sad
---
Also who the hell cares about the ricochet nerf? Who even knew the sleeper could do that first of all?
---
Actually, it looks like the servitor spawning back in consumes the Nova (like when Taken spawning sometimes consumes a tether), which makes this even more frustrating.
---
"Laughs in bungo" got me. Haha
---
Ye they also did that in D1 with whisper, very questionable decision making on their part, but absolutely not worth this stupid amount of backlash.
---
Fact is, whisper fell out of meta ever since the ammo nerf, way too many people are pretending they still use it.
---
Your in a different dreaming city

Dredgen...
---
Very underrated crucible rifle tbh
---
Not enough range
---
And for some reason RNG has been sucking my off and I‚Äôve got two Snapshot Opening shot and two Snapshot Moving Target... 
---
I don‚Äôt even like Bite of the Fox...
---
Yeah I wait for the temporary disappearance now. I have learned... patience.
---
Fuck off no advertising here
---
Even though this is a joke, it somewhat brings up the right point.
---
Whisper wouldn't be "too good" if your encounters weren't too amateurish.
---
Lol. I gafawed
---
I tend to just mush myself all up in the servitors business because otherwise the nova seems to think I want to target an immune shank... Whyyyy
---
DAYUM that servitor has some smoother moves than The Professor from the AND 1 mixtapes :‚Äô)
---
‚ÄúWe have decided that supers make some encounters trivial when used properly. We‚Äôve removed nova bomb and tether from the game. This should lead to more variety in PVE encounters that we don‚Äôt have to design around.‚Äù

- Bungie
---
Wow, I just use auto rifles.
---
He didn't get phalanxed though, is this a normal melee attack. Phalanxed is when the melee stomp glitches with phalanxes and YEETS you across the universe.
---
You, me and datto
---
LoW lost flat 20% damage.
---
Ty for your reply.
---
You just made my point for me. Annual Items are not comparable to the current exotics. Agreed. What's the difference? One is free in-game whilst the other isn't. And because of that, a number of very special weapons like WoTW has to be brought down closer to the level of Annual Pass items. Same thing for exotic armors. That was my point, which you have kindly elaborated. They are making a purely business decision, not a re-balancing one, which alot of ppl are readily believing. That is the distinction I am putting forward for our fellow guardians to think about.
---
And pre nerf box breathing. People seem to forget this
---
That's. . . not what I was saying at all. I don't see how I made your point, we are making two totally separate points.
---
They're not the happiest bunch of Redditors right now....
---
Holy shit Rift, what a game mode, please bring this back Bung
---
They both have nerfs and buffs. Overall, however, I do believe they are both still nerfs. LoW got a QoL buff, but it got a straight decrease in damage. Ace lost one of its more useful tropes, which was retaining MM after the weapon was stowed, and got back one extra bullet for it.
---
Nerfs are mostly understandable imo but still great edit!
---
Brother I've seen every composition in Comp all the way to Mystic 3. It seems like the most I see though are either spectral and arc strider hunters and hammer Titans, and few nova and handheld nova locks. Use what you're best at, and leave nothing on the table.
---
Comp is about wins, not your subclass. Do whatever it takes.
---
Spotdodged.
---
Holy shot gladd
---
Not a banana pfft
---
I thought maybe it should take from reserves but the last 3 shots regenerate ammo so like you only have those 3 shots left and no room to miss a shot. That way if you're good enough you can continue unloading but just 1 missed crit would stop the regen
---
and taken makes target immune right as I fire
---
I blame mostly EA
---
Man I need to get me some a dem saurons gauntlets
---
Well if you feel like helping support Randy *Fucking* Pitchford then go ahead. That shit head isn't going to get a cent of my money.
---
Well, i typically touch on everything i want to get across online simply because things can easily be missed, but just for you, i will make this post as quick and clean as i can. 
---
1. The reference bit in my post before this one was in regards to you calling the marshmello skin a reference, which it isn't, making it a poor example. I didn't fail to say what it was, it is a brand deal between the two companies to have a licensed skin in game, that is what it falls under. 
---
2. I also said "Or pays homage too," which was included for a reason, That is what the reaper skin would fall under. (And i mean is it really all that hard to make a look a like of a guy with longer black hair and a bear, in a black suit? kind of a weak argument don't you think?) And i use the word typically because while they are the most used definitions, i am leaving room for others, because i do not have a 100% answer on it so theres that.
---
3. I asked you several times to show me what skins you are referring to when you say "Obvious look a likes" So i will ask you again **What skins are you referring too when you say obvious look alikes and what do they resemble?** I also had the list of skins to show skins that are references, this was more in line with my point of what a reference is, not anything else. 
---
4. Crackshot and Nutcracker Zenyatta are both skins pulling from an outside source, a holiday nutcracker. Both skins were released as Christmas exclusive skins because nutcrackers are a common theme in the holidays. Here is a link showing the two skins with a nutcracker https://imgur.com/a/oLnLjNO Notice how they both pull resemble the nutcracker??? That is not an opinion, that is a fact for you, my opinion is that if you asked me which did crackshot resemble more, The actual nutcracker or Zen, i would point to the Nutcracker. 
---
5. I did the word analyze to show you how you were coming off, the end bit was me coming off as a jerk and i can fully admit that, but that is how i felt you were coming off through your choice of words and phrases, as well as context. The way you were discussing things with other people were coming off in those ways, at least they were to me, but that is my opinion.  
---
6.  Never once did i say that they do not copy, hell i even pointed out a better example then you have this entire conversation with Blackbeard and Sledgehammer, My point was that in your original post you say  "I've seen fortnite copy a lot of skins from different games" and "And thousands of skins ripped from overwatch." When in all reality, they are not the only gaming company to do this, and they do not even do it as much as you are claiming.  Also, i didn't accidentally admit anything, i purposely admitted it because when you are just debating with someone, you admit the right and wrong of both sides, if you are trying to win an argument, then you are biased in your information and try to hide things, and had i not said that, or brought up black beard, i would have been hiding plain to see look a likes, but that is also where i asked to see what you are referring to when you say other look a likes, because to me other then black beard and john wick, there arent many. 
---
Ultimately, i wasn't offended by your comment, i was debating it, and online it can be hard to tell the difference but all of this was just a debate to me at the end of the day. Ultimately this one was still kind of long, but both of us have been writing essays at this point, so its not easy to narrow it all down to just a sentence or two for each point.
---
Lost 20% damage-getting deeper pockets(more damage) from the catalyst
---
Sooo tired of these whiny posts.
---
Ace is more balance than Nerf. LoW is getting deeper pockets from catalyst so damage isn't really gone.
