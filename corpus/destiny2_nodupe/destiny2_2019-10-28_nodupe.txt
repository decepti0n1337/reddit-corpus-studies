Comp to 2100 isn't too bad this season. If you're a semi-competent PvP player you can get it this season.

The forges are now on a daily rotation on the bottom left of the EDZ map. Also Tuesday they are fixing the bug for the Keymold. 👽
---
Damn... High quality post. Nice. Btw. Where is my second post here? My comment history shows me this is somewhere there. Also i triggered 12 people, could be better i say for such low effort bait.
---
Always look for help? Make sure you use comms. Keep at a quest if you start it because most of the time it’s worth it?
---
Just back out of the game then back in. It should pop. If not, just wait a few minutes. I also heard doing another match of crucible works too.

This is common for guardians going at high speed. Tube GLs cause a bit of actual knockback when firing and traveling at high speeds (such as here to the pit in the corrupted strike) can cause hilarious physicing to happen to you

Get a full choke shotgun, go middle tree arcstrider, Shotgun ape + reflecting super. Should do you right

Fact!: the people who use OEM complained about Wormhusk when it was at its prime (it wasn’t as good as OEM is now)
---
I was kind of in the same boat as you. I played a ton y1 and then fell off the radar until shadowkeep. I got the armor set and rolls that I wanted and then used upgrade modules and duplicates to beef up what I had. Currently at 958 light. As for weapons, just pick up exotic quests and pinnacle weapons, and look out for good rolls on your more used/favorite weapons. Outlaw, kill clip, snapshot sights, etc... Basically just explore and enjoy all the content that’s available to you and your build will come together. As for my weapons I use spare rations, go figure, jade rabbit, nameless midnight, recluse, heroes burden, badlander, and erianas vow regularly.
---
Gun? Or ornament?
---
The grind starts at 900. Fortunately you have powerful drops, unfortunately rng will screw you over by making 3 of every 5 powerfuls drop for the same slot
---
Yeah its pretty trash like bungie forums.

Ah thanks a lot! That’s very helpful :)!

You need to do the old nightfalls (right side of vangaurd playlist) it doesn't have matchmaking so you will need to get a group.

Don't join the chats and use what you want. I don't have any of them and do just fine in pvp and pve. People suck in online games, and any game that lets you default to no text or voice chat is greatness. Use it.

After 900 you need to look for things that give a tier of 'powerful gear'. Otherwise progress will be quite slow as you're seeing

In place of The Recluse, I'd suggest Mob Justice.  Super nice SMG.

It do

Thanks, now I understand.

bold of you to assume i use anything but my shoulders and fists

Never seen nor heard of something more legendary in the destiny franchise then this

Terraria is a game with an insane amount of depth. It’s one of the highest rated steam games and it’s sort of a minecrafty sandbox game. Tonnes of fun and I can’t recommend it enough.
---
After watching fallouts video I was shocked at what the hunter can tank. I hope people realize hope OP this is.
---
Ngl, my loadout only consists of guns i find cool.
---
I’m sort of gimping myself but I don’t use any of the reckoning guns 😫
---
That gambit prime ogre thinks I fucked his mother
---
I just ran around with a good ad clear gun like recluse or huckleberry and a roaming super (dawnblade or striker titan. Hunter doesn’t really have good supers but I guess arcstrider)
---
Outbreak Perfected week 5?
---
how can you be mad at someone for using recluse in pve? sounds like you just don't have it.
---
so i was playing terraria the minecraft way?
---
Hey this is my first time playing crucible  , so I might be just as clueless as you are , all I do is jump in survival free lance. Maybe it was a double point week or I'm on a streak or something ?
---
I had this happen to me about a week ago. It was on the Titan map and the spinny platforms didn't spawn in so you would immediately die if you went where they were supposed to be. People kept leaving and the new people were so confused

I/gr33nmuff1n [I would suggest grinding for the pinnacle weapons as early as you can.  They’re god rolled, unique legendary weapons you can grind for without having to worry about all of the RNG nonsense that comes with trying to get non curated perfectly rolled weapons to drop.  ](https://youtu.be/XJKWrrJw3YE)

If there is guardian in the path, will it dead
---
nobody:
---
warlocks: i have fallen and cannot get up
---
Well, it seems for the most part that bum rushing doesn't put you at your A Game, especially if the last opponent standing is really trying to win. Getting cocky rarely nets you positive results.
---
Dead Orbit is salvation
---
use recluse for the multikills if you have it, if not any other smg will do but it wont be as fast, when youre done with the multikills, you could pull a bow or auto rifle out and multitask doing other weapon quests at the same time and youll gradually get the medals and points, if you have any friends that like gambit you might aswell go in with them since doing it with someone can make it feel faster
---
I'm wondering the same thing because I had like 20 mobility mods before Chad O'Keefe but I can use em on any of my armor
---
Medals like killmonger/thrillmonger count for decent progress the smg kills multi kills is easy the medals and points isn’t that bad army of one counts for a decent chunk of progress as well.
---
how would you know? that's oddly specific
---
Have 3 characters and do every single thing that says "powerful gear" on all three characters. That will be the fastest way. After you finish everything on one character, swap the high guns to the next character and go into collections and pull blue armor to catch up the armor to the guns. Then do all the powerfuls on that second character. Repeat with third.
---
they wanted to rework the whole factions system because it was really grindy and boring back in year 1 of d2 but in the end they just ended up not bringing it back ever again
---
Wait they give loot? Damn, actually need to go and do them now
---
Exotics are generally world drops(just play the game), there are a few you can get just via the campaign and quests. For good stuff I would advise just watching a YouTube video, as well it matters on what you’ll play. For visuals legendaries all have the option of being able to use a eververse ornament so if you are using those you can just re-apply
---
It's still available, you can even get it if you're circumsized I heard
---
1. Other than Exotic Quests and Xur you have to get a lucky drop for an exotic weapon. Some exotic weapons are actually decent, others are situational and the rest are pretty much garbage.
---
2. If you are looking to level up you should do as many activities as you can until you get passed 900, then you should be doing powerfuls. If you are looking for exotics, an easy way to get them is through high level nightfalls, the chances of an exotic armour piece are about 1 in 3.
---
3. You can use upgrade modules to infuse, if I were you I’d wait until you are a higher level to infuse your gear. Just having higher leveled gear in your inventory will count towards your higher gear drops. This means you can really wear whatever you want as long as your highest gear is in your inventory.
---
Let me know if you need anything cleared up :)
---
Good luck guardian!
---
You’d have a tough time I’d imagine
---
okay hanzo
---
fuck hunters
---
this post was made by crayon eater gang
---
Titans don't use Lunas they require aim which goes against the titans code.
---
Because that is what happens when you contradict large groups of morons who enjoy paying for the same thing twice, a person I know that has d1 still is always talking the same way too lazy to switch the game disk to go and be nostalgic so he's always on about them bringing back stuff it's so dumb
---
Are you saying there should be a Cross promotion!
---
Oh my god... using Oxygen, without meme-ing it? What?
---
We need a calus crying voice line.
---
Im gunna go with probably not, but at the same time try anyway I want you to prove me wrong :)
---
Shit Im circumsized so i hope this is true
---
Ahhhhhh didnt realize that part
---
That was a fun/annoying quest
---
The fuck was that team doing lol
---
[deleted]
---
Oh no there's more then one... Haha
---
I did it all in gambit prime. As a Titan I equipped peacemakers and just ran double smg’s for the smg portion. Medals just come as you play. I never invaded during this quest but I did murder invaders. My heavy was just either 1k voices or a tracking rocket launcher
---
which helmet
---
never mind I have it
---
This exotic quest requires forsaken and completion of the forsaken campaign
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/Fk5XBwk

That’s the pic. I’m not to upset by internet douches, I just wanted actual help. 
---
Oh I know a good system is amazing. I never had the money for it growing up, but I wanted a pc like my cousin had. Once I got used to the control, the BF4 game I was playing was super fun.
---
I hadn’t noticed anything until today when it was everywhere.
---
Skull Fort I believe
---
I used a snapshot / quickdraw Beloved to get my Revoker. I like the reticle, nice little circle.
---
Ssd usually only helps with load times. It doesn't serve as a cpu boost or GPU boost. Just faster read/write speed of data. I play every game when too lazy to copy to my ssd on my 7200rpm and only change is load times. A pc tho and a lot beefier than yours... But still same should apply.
---
And how does one acquire this quest? Because i did the two quests Eris gave me and there's nothing to pick up from her.
---
Have you never had or been killed by a luna? Hell my claws of the wolf kills 3x faster than that bow, 5x faster with kill clip proc'd
---
If bungie made a weapon that feels OP but isn't I say they deserve some praise. That's not easy to do
---
I accept that I will, I’m totally fine with being composed of 12 polygons.
---
I like the way the recoil moves the sight back
---
Oh hell yeah my dude gonna rock the hell out of it.
---
implying that the Last Word is an exotic that can boost my fps in crucible
---
God yes, the official forums feel like wading through toxic sludge, there are no productive posts at all. All you see are complaints about any and every little thing. So much whinging about different things, such as needing upgrade modules to infuse when they're cheaper to buy now from Banshee-44 than it was to infuse anything during Year 2. So much whining about having to use *random equipment* during the couple hours it takes to get to 900. 
---
I also saw the same dumb complaints about having to use different weapons for Iron Banner. Never mind that the previous Iron Banner quest made you use a lot more specific and odd types of weapons, and you needed a lot more kills with them. The quest this time could be completed within a couple hours at most, last season's took the better part of a day with how grindy certain steps were.
---
Thank you, any specific channels you would recommend?
---
That's evidence it can drop from comp, not only comp
---
I figured as much. Here’s to hoping I guess.
---
This will not run destiny.
---
I actually have no clue, my thought process was just that all the new players were complaining about it since I hadn’t seen it any more than usual myself.
---
It’s on your end m8
---
Before you select gambit or prime, hold square.
---
No people who whine about recluse should just try to get it,  one of my friends is as terrible at crucible as you can imagine and he got it in freelance survival in 3 days of trying for a few hours at a time really it's not as competitive as people think it is and after losing 2 or 3 matches he went on a 5 streak you just need to TRY
---
Maybe it was just a coincidence that I ran into so many in such a short time, I just hope that’s the case.
---
A poor man's OEM. You get ability energy when you take damage, and it refills health to full on a kill, but it doesn't refill shields, so you end up at 80/200 HP after every kill. Significantly better in horde modes like Bergusia Forge where there are tons of squishy enemies shooting at you, not that good in PVP though. At most, it'll help you escape a handcannon shootout in a 2v1 after downing one of them.
---
Just keep playing through the various story missions once you see the grifter (can’t remember if it’s just before or after) ada should become available. There are some old and new Ytube vids on that.
---
Check this week at bungie from this past Thursday. They said undying wont be available to get after this season
---
No.
---
I understood nothing, that was my first time playing pvp
---
What someone not using Erentil in crucible?
---
Yes
---
That’s fairly reasonable. I just think OEM has been overlooked for too long and hunters have always gotten the nerf. I’m ready for OEM to meet its maker
---
FUCK
---
Bow-chicka-bow-wow
---
Fact!: people who still complain about OEM are upset that an exotic is actually good and don't know how to counter it
---
I shidded and cammed my pants, but mostly cammed
---
Weekly vendor bounties, and missions w/ the gold star on the destination map.
---
Its a rabbit hole you don't want to go down.
---
Basically its an activity on Mars where you do patrols, escalation events, public events, lost sectors, etc to get Resonant Stems. Gather 4 and you can combine them to get an override frequency. Now each of those overrides has a description giving you a hint to which sleeper node its for. There are 40 of these diamond shape nodes floating around Mars. Now which of those nodes you can open is entirely RNG based and its not uncommon for players to spend days or even more than a week or two trying to grind that stupid activity.
---
Feel free to do some searching and you'll likely come across people complaining about it. Even I've all but given up on it after collecting over 700 fragments in total and RNG completely sodomizing me on getting the right override frequency to open the remaining 5 nodes. Should mention I was also grinding out some triumphs while doing this and working on other stuff.
---
sometimes you just gotta lime cry, you know?

Low sodium replace raid secrets plz

I did that with mountain top and it blew me up.
---
I assume it's retroactive like most pinnacle weapons so I think it would be fine if you drop below 5500 but I would play it safe and try your best to not drop below
---
Hmm, I hadn't thought of that. I thought it said stuff like "your invader's back and they got X kills" but maybe they have that voice line for friendly invader's too.
---
Might as well get the name right if you’re going to make commentary otherwise it’s confusing to some.
---
Recluse
---
Nope, it’s really not, theyre almost the exact same gun and you’re making a big deal out of it saying it’s “necessary”

I love the inside joke. Literally made it my favorite shell. The ghost is in the moon, thus the moon is haunted. Very nice bungo 😎 well done

All you did was ruin the joke
---
Tire Game, near Eris, there's a secret triumph if you get all three tires into the middle crater.
---
You dont need a fancy case by any means. HOWEVER I implore you to at least use one.  Itll protect the delicate components from foreign objects, and most dust that can harm them.  
---
Your cpu must match with your motherboard.  You can skimp out on the case, power supply (as long as its powerful enough for your build) you don't need fancy rgb, and fiber wrapped cables.  
---
You can skimp on cooling, though I've had great experience with the corsair h100i liquid 
---
cooling. 
---
You wont actually NEED a top of the line gpu either.  Most people I play with have a gtx1060/1070.  Personally, I'm running a founder's gtx 1080ti.  (Which prices are very nice at the moment)  
---
you wont need a disk drive anymore that's old school stuff.
---
Spicy milk works too lol
---
That was supposed to be a joke?
---
But I-I use a scout rifle-
---
I would totally buy that Lord Shaxx is Shaq underneath the helmet, and that he wore the helmet and developed an accent to hide the fact that he's a pre golden age celebrity.
---
I was fully expecting a loud moaning pornstar
---
Just use the destiny companion app and you can transfer weapons from one character to another. It’s really helpful do you don’t have to have waist materials on buying multiple of the same weapons from collections. It’s also easier to transfer gos rolls of good weapons so you don’t have to grind out a lot. It also makes it so you only have to do a quest on one character. And btw don’t make multiple characters of the same class, it just hurts you more than helps
---
Lol ya I still fuck up a lot of those jumps in whisper and I’ve ran it a stupid amount of times
---
2/4 of them are hunters.
---
Is that a nechrocasm I see? God how I miss that gun
---
... don’t really know what to say
---
This season is prob a bit easier in my opinion since I often run solo in crucible. Especially with the freelance comp, since you'll never match with a full coordinated fireteam in the normal comp. Give that a go perhaps if you haven't. Try to have a bit of fun too. I know comp will get a bit stressing, and I know I came across a few people who were feeling down when we lost a round in a match. I know I read a good rule is. If you get two consecutive loss. Take a break and come back. DW. I know you'll be alright, you'll hit fabled before you'll even realize it!
---
That sounds hella cursed.
---
Will a Rubbermaid box with a couple holes drilled out for 2-3 fans for air movement work?
---
You can get it again from collections for almost nothing
---
I use a load out I don’t consider THAT scummy but apparently it is...*deep breath*
---
Insurmountable Skullfort with Mida Multi Tool...
---
.....I did what I had to do for my people.
---
Is it really that hard to understand he was joking?
---
You can tell your not serious because if you were serious you would have just said "the world" but instead you said "ZA WARUDO" so it's clearly a joke and not a reason for me to type "ZA WARUDO" twice in a reddit comment.
---
Yes because the darkness saw how strong it was making guardians and wanted to do that with the hive. 
---
But in all honesty the nine are the ones making drifter crazy with visions of the darkness and the coming war or at least it’s implied from the invitation of the nine quests.
---
I don’t think it was bugged I think bungie’s dev team got really fuckin lazy and said fuck it I don’t wanna do it and just removed it and told us some dumb shit and we gobbled it up like a diabetic in a cake factory.
---
who know though.
---
That or fated engrams giving you an exotic that you haven't unlocked yet.
---
Totally calling them cookies from now on.
---
Damn it I was gonna say that
---
Annnnndddd.....then we shot all the crystals! Yay!
---
 Who needs hand cannons when you have UNSTOPPABLE MELEE
---
How about peacekeepers with antiope d and recluse.
---
Uh bro that looks real painful not joking
---
“Builds” in this game are nowhere near the synergy of borderlands. That being said if you do a devour voidwalker with breach refractor, recluse, and nez sin, you’re pretty much unkillable. Recluse can be replaced by any void primary that can take an anti barrier mod
---
U just didnt say that bro, you just didnt XD
---
Im the one beeing Toxic?? Talk to that guy, the one who T Bags everyone thinking hes good at the game. And as i said, im TRYING builds, not beeing a sweat that thinks im good.
---
I always thought dying in darkness zones  implied your ghost was targeted and killed trying to resurrect you. That would explain why sometimes enemies keep firing at your dead body ( and your ghost) for a little bit after your death.
---
I think it doesnt matter really, the important part is to have a team, tgat can revive and split all thre elements among each other. I also recommend one person with a long range wepon for sniper shanks
---
ᵛᴱˣ ᶜᵁᴹ
---
What do you mean?
---
Honestly no 
---
I can’t it’s bungies fault for putting it in the game in the first place
---
Oh I mean hows the gun balance etc... like do they normalize the gear scores and the damage each guns do? or are the differences really great that a player with trash gear is impossible to beat a player with good gear?
---
I’ve never done Last Wish before. I thought that it’s gonna be harder than Leviathan.
---
Unstoppable round on mountaintop bungie pls
---
Light doesn't matter for it anymore as it's light level is 700, what you really need is a team with each player using a different element for shields
---
Aside from you missing the point of the post, this is just a poor way of thinking. If that’s your feeling, why bother balancing the game at all?
---
The mods are useless anyway, you can just one-two punch or Izanagi double-tap barrier champions and you can straight up DPS the other types anyway.
---
At this point you just sacrifice an armor mod slot and *a lot* of energy or a weapon mod slot to deal with them.
---
Opressive Darkness is worth though.
---
You made that account two hours ago to troll this forum
---
It 100% works with Nezarec’s
---
man it’s so fun dragging my tiny balls on the ground in twilight gap so I’m not seen on the radar while I’m using Randy’s throwing knife and recluse while using OEM hahahahahaha.
---
Cat ghost
---
lol, the only thing I hate about the game is people complaining about stuff, especially stuff like this(some quests) that are ment to be grindy ;D
---
Yeah you can maybe complain about certain loadouts being more dominant than anything else(khm OEM shotgun mountaintop recluse), and if you've played since year one(or D1) you should know that bungo likes to give people grindy stuff to do and you should be used to it.
---
On purpose mind you.
---
I think we’re in the same boat. I just downloaded and installed the update and turned it on the see what happened. Before I had only played vanilla, and had a titan and hunter at light level 280. After the install. Both of my characters are now level 750. All of my equipment in
---
Vault and on characters were also now changed to be 750. I didn’t go on any missions. I just talked to everyone at the tower to get used to everything that’s added. It seems like if you talk to Amanda in the hanger I can now go to all planets that were previously not destinations I could even see on the map. I can now go do the previous DLC before forsaken, but I don’t think I can do the forsaken missions. I noticed I can also do some seasonal, but since I didn’t buy the season pass it’s hard for me to explain. But now I can do gambit mode stuff. I’m still exploring the changes. But as someone that only did vanilla : all of my stuff is level 750, I can do all DLC released before forsaken, some of the things from forsaken era, and intro to Shadowkeep, but not anything else. Lots of mechanical changes that I’m still learning like stat changes and finishing moves. But yea hope my experiences helps she’s some light.
---
..... How.
---
To say facts.
---
Feel free to give me the hate, probably all of u are Titans doing the same
---
:shrugs:
---
Nerf? In progress.
---
Now I gotta
---
Yea but if some new players read it they might be expecting it to happen, which could lessen the campaigns story
---
If only you knew how bad things really are
---
That was fucking hot as all hell
---
literally none of those are decent besides synthoceps.
---
Is it still an at all likely drop? Given that Warmind came out so long ago
---
They’re harvesting guardians!
---
Yeah, just go farm rahool if you have a bunch of legendary shards, or whatever planet you want except Mercury/mars
---
Mad lad
---
Yep because you can't die because of that floating little asshole
---
There's one in the files but isn't in the game yet you'd know if there's one in game because there'll be an empty catalyst slot
---
Especially with the leg armour Xur had the other day. Allows rapid charging in the last 1/5th of the super bar and sniper-level reach? Yes please.
---
Smgs have a very specific range at which they are the best. Recluse requires you to get a kill to do a lot of damage. Having taken these two points into consideration you need another weapon to proc master of arms and then stay out of shotgun range while not being too far from the enemy.
---
I played a Comp game today against a Titan who was using Mountaintop, Recluse, Striker, OEM, and Wardcliff Coil
---
My team still won, and I teabagged his lifeless body into the void at the end of the game
---
Repeat bounties mate. Some had level 100 after 4 days of the expansion coming out.
---
Oh ik I just figured I’d mention the orginal Supers. However yes Chaos Reach imo is the best super for PvE, however for Pvp I’m thinking it’s still Dawnblade
---
Better than me
---
It allows it user to reach Ultra-Instinct.
---
Yes afaik.
---
Simple fix to oem...either make it heal or track...it cant be both. It feels like its 2 exotic mixed into one.
---
Hunters can also track with foetracer but you dont see people complain about it cause it doesnt come with the heal.
---
yo what? Near guaranteed auto win in a gunfight which if you win getting a full heal and an overshield plus a damage boost to carry into the next gunfight to get another auto win isnt good enough??????
---
Taken Phalanx, Oryx's finest creation
---
The cat mask is from d1 if that's what you mean
---
Top arc is nuts in pvp.
---
how do you tell what element to use against what shields?
---
Yea, bows are really fun! Use the one you have for now and try to get either the black armoury one or a different random drop.
---
Nightmare hunts with the vanity in the name
---
But there are achievements? Yes they aren't called them that directly but you have an entire page in the character menu dedicated to triumphs and titles which are destiny's achievements
---
You : Has devinity
---
Also you : Can't do tire game
---
[From the same sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/crystalgrowing/comments/cgic2h/failed_attempt_at_regular_octahedral_chrome_alum/), upper right one looks kind of like a purple engram lol
---
I wonder what class you play the most
---
Yet
---
The earlier levels are easier. The xp needed goes up with every level by 100,000. Plus, repeatable bounties give the lowest amount of xp. 
---
If that was how they were getting it, you'd be able to see that by looking at their history, which is all over the place.
---
You got it months before me. You used it everywhere. I got killed by them thousand times while I try to land 3 hand cannon headshots. Isnt that enough?
---
*gets killed cause of some nonsense* 
---
*satanicherpes is confused*
---
Are you on the same character? Quest is per character
---
Каждый дрочет как хочет, похуй
---
Yes but there aren't any weekly rewards
---
I feel the anti barrier,  unstable, &amp; overload shouldn't take up a mod slot or at least have a separate slot for the season mods
---
So how do you counter it?
---
JESSE IT THE CRYSTALS AREN'T BIG ENOUGH
---
Get bounties and just play the game
---
They will go away as soon as OEM gets the Wormhusk treatment. (I.E. Drop kicked into the trashcan of complete unusability) Like the thing already got nerfed and it wasn't enough. Hopefully Bungie realized that its not the exotics numbers that are busted, it is the function. Heal + Overshield + Damage boost + Wall hacks. 
---
As soon as this happens the posts will probably swap over to Scout Rifles or something else. But atm OEM is the most busted shit in the game and the apes that use it will be made fun of.
---
Warlocks are pretentious dick heads... I main hunter
---
Thanks for such a quick response. I meant to ask as well, how am i to access it?
---
Each rank level is always 100k.
---
I wish I could get Forsaken but I don’t have the $50NZD to purchase it.
---
It makes us feel better also.
---
I assume you play a Titan?
---
1. Yes, indeed they are, each have a specific loot pool to draw from after each completion.
---
2. Some quests disappear completely (alot of newer ones) others you can still pick up on other characters, as they may be necessary to gain acces to certain activities.
---
3. That is semi-accurate, the artifact (Season rank 7 reward) also levels up, each time requiring more XP but giving the player a +1 artificial power bonus ontop of their gear power score.
---
4. For most most strikes yes, Nightfall strikes and Nightfall: The Ordeal strikes above above hero difficulty do not have matchmaking. Raids do not, but some older raids have a guided game matchmaking mechanic (underused and doesn't really count).
---
5. You can run games with randoms and there are plenty of LFG websites and apps out there to help finding teammates easier, i prefer [www.destinylfg.net](https://www.destinylfg.net)
---
6. Any activity can drop good gear, it is down to what is currently meta and what the individual prefers. Raid and other end game activities such as Master difficulty activities and Iron Banner can drop higher total stat rolled armor, but other than that there isn't a huge benefit to Raid drops. Other than that they ofc are specific to the raid and unaquirable anywhere else. Some exotics are also locked behind raids.
---
7. Soft cap is 900 (only powerful rewards give hgher power over this), Hard cap 950 (only pinnacle rewards give higher power over this), Total cap 960, but artificial power bonus from artifact is layered upon this, so essentially there is no limit.
---
8. In most PvP modes no, usually power advantages are turned off, in some cases it is turned on, this will be stated when you hover over the PvP activity, Iron Banner always has power advantages enabled.
---
Hope this helped :) Welcome to the community
---
More like yeeting
---
If thats the case then I'm fucked cuz I don't own the dlc
---
Disruption is very much a pve mod. It's way stronger than people think. You're able to pacify any annoying enemies
---
You've failed your task successfully
---
Why tf theres no chat? Mmorpg with no chat.. wtf
---
Honestly I was willing to buy the game, but now that I got it for free I think I'll buy at least one Forsaken, about shadowkeep, are they going to add new stuff later on or is it all out from the start?
---
I only play Titan and I love this meme lol
---
Yeah. It's often stupidly arbitrary.
---
Im pretty sure there suppose to be 3 upcoming season pass after this season.
---
When I first started destiny last time, i was doing the red war cuz thats what you do at the beginning right? Now apparently I have to do it again
---
Yeah too bad for me I have to/want equip Rose or Ikelos HC or exotic HC :&lt;
---
I have done with my warlock it’s actually pretty easy
---
Sounds like you may be gliding too late
---
You're not working with the enemies. Well, sort of I guess. You're two opposing teams, fighting to kill your side of the enemies to gather and bank motes. The goal of the game mode is to summon and kill your Taken Primeval. But reaching certain mote milestones will allow you/the enemy to invade on to your/their side, letting you kill them to have them drop their motes/heal their Primeval.

Poor Greg. He's been abused enough.

Faster fire rate shreds in pvp. You can use any mode for pve but its primarily a weapon that shines in pvp
---
go away
---
of course xD barrier knight champions ?!
---
You know... It was probably his gaming chair and Gfuel code. As well as their strong ad read for RAID SHADOW LEGENDS!
---
It's like wen ghost said xol was stronger than orix, I get triggered every time I hear that.
---
What kind of wack ass titan actually aims?
---
It's a must if you want the Undying title iirc.
---
Unstoppable was an understatement lol glad the leviathans breath was released
---
Any idea whats the bow on the left?
---
Nah, although that's annoying too now that you mention it. But I'm talking about what's shown in the video where the tail end of your flight you start dropping stupidly fast.
---
To finish this problem I think the problem was indeed the moon bounties not counting.  If one titan planet bounty was worth 15 then logically a moon bounty should also be 15.  I finished 6 moon bounties at 99% catalyst.  For that to have been possible I would have had to shown 95%.
---
Not true
---
I dont understand how hand cannons are meta. Reddit is the only place I see this mentioned. Hand cannons all suck ass to me.
---
Okay. Thanks! I had bits and pieces of that, but not everything.
---
For real, only played about 5 Crucible games and I'm getting ruined. Feels like my gun does 10% damage of everyone else's.
---
Now I just want a Crucible game mode that gives you a Riskrunner and nothing else.
---
Ya’ll need to play less Pokemon or some shit idk. SMH.
---
We've not been out in deep space to see the fleet, and let's be honest, the hologram in the Queen's chamber wouldn't exactly leave much of an impression on anyone who doesn't already know what they're looking at.
---
Space Magic
---
Actually did get multikills that's why I never understood why the medals were moving so slow. Only way I could get them to move was with fusion kills after I hit 47% it stopped going up for a while.
---
Agreed
---
Yeah seriously
---
Just hitting stuff. Some strikes with the bosses that go immune over and over you can just spam shields at the boss when there's no adds to kill to keep your super up. This only really works with the grenadier modifier active though.
---
So it's fairly easy without the overshield activated as long as you're aware they know where you are
---
At that point just win a 1v1
---
When vengeance is active I like to just bait them out. It's not always possible but if you can get them to try and chase you you have a pretty good chance of having them run out. If you can't bait them then obviously things like shotguns fusions and snipers still take them out with relative ease
---
Yea it's not an easy counter and you really need to work on how to play it but it's not as impossible as everyone says
---
Not all titans. Just OEM titans.
---
You don't see people complain about foetracer because it's really not that good
---
I got headshot from downtown, EVERY TIME, how is that even fair?!
---
That Titan just got baited not a good player at all
---
That's amazing
---
E.) Pull out a shotgun and kill him
---
But where do you get it from?
---
If this works on taken captains in gambit it might be my new favourite thing
---
That will hurt my chances as a hunter main then!
---
The current Nightfall strike has enemies called Barrier Knights. Get their HP down low enough and they will create a bubble shield around themselves that A: heals them to full if it stays active, and B: deflects all projectiles without taking damage **unless you bring a weapon with Anti Barrier Rounds mod** (the current seasonal artifact will provide you with the ability to put this mod on specific weapon types). Of course you could just nuke them if you have enough firepower... but you can't rely on randoms to help you with that so just bring a weapon with AB rounds.
---
My router is plugged into a glass of water with a lemon in it.
---
If your struggling this much with finding a group. Try soloing it
---
My raid group in FFXIV called them additional enemies. It was used for pretty much anything that spawned new enemies. Adds.
---
There are dozens of us! Dozens!
---
Ahhhh. Bugger that’s a shame haha
---
I can go this low on all my characters because the starting armour is what you want
---
I hardly ever don't use misfit. Best weapon, let alone auto rifle, in my opinion
---
If the genie were bungie would be the opposite, no wishing for a nerf.
---
Ah yes I can make a post about how much i love 360 rpm autos and we can all jerk each other off in the comments about it or I can make a post about a more controversial subject and have a discussion / debate. One of these is much more interesting than the other.
---
Was literally coming to suggest that people running Zero Hour and SotP should be visible from the Tower under certain circumstances.
---
Id put my sword down my back, SMG on my waist, and sniper across my back. You could put a sword in you head as a unicorn horn, or on your arm to be slightly more useful looking.

My Gamertag is Dr Skidmarks MD. Can you make me an acceptable name for Lore purposes?
---
Welp looks like we damaged them, now we're all marked for vengeance
---
I’m fine with this. HC were meta for a long time. Let scouts come back in for a season or two. The game is chock full of exotic HC and legendary end game HC. I’m up for a little bit of change. This way you get to see some more diverse play styles. Plus this opens up new load outs. Instead of having to use snipers or bows you now have another option. Personally for me the people complaining about scouts are either use to the aggressive meta and not use to long range guns that can kill you. Or they are taking a hand cannon into a map and running to long and trying to fight a scout that way. Certain maps reward certain play styles. If you don’t want to get melted by a scout avoid areas with long angles on the map. If the map has a bunch of long angles, then I recommend you get a scout because when your on a close range map your HC, SMG and shotgun will still reign supreme.
---
Well I did the Bow Legendary frame last night for the first time ever, the only other one I've ever done (over a month ago) was the auto rifle. It still didn't count towards the number of Legendary frames forges. Super frustrating...
---
Unstoppable melee lol
---
Shoulder charge takes your melee ability, and you have to charge it by sprinting. The only difference is whether your grenade hits them or your body. They both have about the same range, 1 hit kill potential, and have similar ways to make the ability come back faster. Based on your same reasoning, supernova just takes brainless holding of your grenade button
---
u didn't take it, the most part of the people pelay gambit only when necessary
---
fROM WHERE?
---
It's the same sorta meme as Marine = Crayon Eater.
---
When most Marines are actually working on college courses in their free time. We know they're not dumb, but big and strong = dumb is a world spanning meme.
---
Titan pounch stuff.
---
Wow this really...
---
Jarring

I’ll see myself out
---
I was negative when I went to sleep last night lol

Takes your grenade, Pre-planning, and charge time.
---
Just started playing after playing the first month D2 came out so it’s been a while, just wondering if there is any vendor who sells shaders outside of the Eververse vendor in the Tower?
---
I've been playing before new light; back when on the ps4 it was free
---
And people say there is only one viable Titan playstyle
---
enslaved happyiness
---
Blue Shield is Arc, so you need an Arc weapon, orange is Solar, so you need a solar weapon, and purple would be void... you get the idea.
---
If I'm not mistaken the first room is Arc, the Second room is Solar, and the room after is a mix??? Been a while since I did it. There should be guides online to tell you how to tackle the mission. 
---
It is HIGHLY recommended that you get a fireteam.
---
Yes there are people who have done it solo, but it's super difficult, and you only have 20 minutes to defeat every single enemy.
---
Whisper of the worm is recommended for it as well.
---
And the perk doesn't even seem to work. I shot a whole magazine in that badboi and it didn't care at all. Also please give exotics a mod socket
---
I do have to agree that Ada is besto-exo aesthetic wise. I just wish she would continue to berate me because I loved the fact someone wasn't just head over heals in awe of us all the time. This is why I love Asher.
---
Oh damn, well then I'm just as confused
---
For me its opposite lol
---
I just got back into the game 3 weeks ago, adter not playing since Curse of Osiris, and not having Curse of Osiris. At least I can be cancerous running striker with shoulder charge and Insurmountable Skull Fort
---
Hopefully not, And no...  
---
But imagine. Xenomorph with Blade Barrage.
---
Explain
---
Yes I heard this too, he was so impressed or fascinated with us because we didn't roll over, so he converted the ship into a pleasure barge instead of a planet killer.
---
Good meme
---
what
---
I think the issue is just the wall hacks. I mean, it doesnt heal you anymore and the overshield feels kinda irrelevant in most cases whenever I go toe-to-toe with an OEM
---
The mark feels like it lasts way too long with no cooldown and literally no effort to proc. I mean, the only reason why I disengage with a titan is because I know they can see exactly when I'm going to peak from, so im at an inherent disadvantage
---
If the wall hacking instead just pulsed 3 or 4 times then went away I feel like it'd be a lot easier to counter while keeping the character of the exotic
---
Have you got a source for that? Not saying it’s wrong just not something I’ve heard or seen mentioned
---
I love Señor Shaxx now
---
The only titans who eat crayons use mountaintop, recluse, one eyed mask, and fist of havoc
---
I'm ok with any titan who doesn't use the "easy mode" button
---
I’ve gotten better by learning one simple thing. Crouching removes you from enemy radars. It helps when you have a close range weapon like the Cerberus +1. I’ve been doing well since I got it.
---
You just stole this from Twitter
---
I’ve been using scouts for a while now, b I don’t really play crucible so if they become meta then whatever
---
To be faaiiiir...
---
The tiebreaker round of normal Gambit is broken as well since hunters get blade barrage back instantly with shards of galanor
---
There is not.
---
You can get several shaders by turning in vendor materials to the various vendors that accept them (including planetary vendors). Many shaders are acquired by dismantling an item with the shader applied to it (Black Armory shaders, the new Iron Banner shaders, etc).
---
Once you have a shader once, you can reobtain it from Collections-&gt;Flair.
---
Yeah, basically. I actually love Titan for the Defender Subclass. I play with Arc weapons but I just can't resist that sweet sweet Shield :P
---
Thanks!
---
Destiny 2 peer to peer shitshow :) tested it many times in private lobby with friends amazing how many shots do not register depending on your network condition we either tried drifferent vpn setups to simulate the distances, ifyou live in eu for example in germany and you get a player from spain on of you will suffer from shit connection that's all.   
---
The other thing when you feel that you start the game and you are dominating but after 3 minutes you became a potato and you can't kill/hit it is because of host migration. Yes main host is a server sided "ghost player" but physycal host is still migrating every 2-3 mins.
---
Dr S. MD/Dr Mark MD, a brilliant... I dunno, whatever you are, hunter? Something more in-depth, like a medic, or pathfinder?
---
then you probably already know the drill :D don't believe anyone telling you it's blocked behind a paywall, im still a free player and im receiving almost all weapons in game including black armory gear. except ofc forsaken/shadowkeep gear/raids...etc
---
The meme would have been good without the emoji
---
Helmet: no idea, maybe a blue?
---
Chest: Phenotype Plasticity ornament
---
Arms: Stronghold
---
Legs: Hardy's Steps ornament 
---
Class Item: Phenotype Plasticity ornament
---
As for the shaders, I'm not sure. Possibly a combination of Watermelon for the chest, class item, and helmet, and Monochrome or the Y1 Trials shader for the arms and legs.
---
Do you plan on posting the results if so when
---
Isn’t that literally just scorched?
---
It’s all about guns. Use pulse for distance and maybe the last word for close up.
---
Pvp imo is completely fucked up so it’s not easy to get into. But when you get into it, there isn’t much skill into it so anyone can be good at it.
---
Or, you can learn how to take a joke lol. It's nothing to get offended over xD
---
What is that auto rifle?
---
Well I should mention this is one of the few times he's running Titan. He is without a doubt one of the best crucible players I know. He's mostly just using this to see just how op this build is.
---
The sad thing is he plays warlock, yeah it’s better than titan, but still. It’s not master race...
---
Alright I thought that was the case. Thank you for your answer and I will try this. Have a good day!
---
I just started playing this game a week after the new light update hit, and I don't understand the hate that Titan gets, I just play him because he fits my playstyle more than the other classes.
---
lol I don’t mean to be that guy but haven’t this community already beaten the dead horse long ago. 🙂
---
[Unlimited Power!](https://images.app.goo.gl/RcpBrPFUyVUcT1EYA)
---
This is why gambit = Garbo 
---
But still drifter lookin thicc
---
I'm a new light player and I feel the opposite.
---
I'm obviously only getting matched up against new people but it feels like I have way better gear than them.
---
When I do PvE stuff suddenly my scout rifle feels like a Nerf gun.
---
I met these fuckers this weekend during the Nightfall.
---
Boy were we surprised when they raped us. It's even better when one of us hid away, and both ogres were FIRING ALL THE LASERS at the dead ghost of our comrades. Non.Stopping.
---
Vicious. Unstoppable.
---
And since I went *BOW* route.....I felt like firing little tiny needles at these creeps.
---
Lesson learned.
---
Alright maybe it wasn't the #1 most broken thing in the game but it was still very dominant for those seasons
---
Couldn’t have said it better myself.
---
Shut up. He was only asking our thoughts on it you need to grow up.

---
Soooooo they’re useless?
---
Pretty much the best use for D.A.R.C.I at the moment is testing the range falloff of weapons in PvP if that answers your question lol
---
The same as the ratio of Thousand Voices to sherpas
---
When we fight these guys its probably gonna be really dramatic, with Rasputin, the cabal, the fallen. Maybe the vex and hive will tag along. It's gonna be a wild ride
---
I always thought this was the toxic forum. Time to subscribe
---
Raid banners are actually a solid investment. They work in multiple activities, and are an investment that benefits not only you but your fire team members
---
Hunter here. Crucible Titans are my nemesis. Nothing but punching and recluse smgs. HOWEVER everywhere else, I love fighting with Titans. Titans make me feel protected.
---
Yup
---
You mean the sniper?
---
So that«s why my Misfit melts those fuckers. I thought it was a "new thing" with those.
---
Hah.
---
Dark Dorito Boi
---
Yeah, I guess. It looks like an AR with a 20" barrel and red dot
---
it's his Halloween outfit man.
---
50 kill STREAK?? thats honestly just insane lol, one of my friends gets about 30-50 kills a game so i farmed comp with him to get fabled rank so i can get recluse. he got me on a 15 win streak and i didn’t do shit. i was playing with another friend and he’s pretty good at it as well. 
---
i’ve never really checked my kd before in a match or if i do i just  forget about it after. i get around 15 kills in a normal game but if the other team is really good i get like 7. a good game would probably be like 20 something kills but i don’t get that a bunch
---
Not sure what catalyst does yet
---
Agree. they should have their own slot, and be equippable on any weapon.
---
Man if only the lore tabs this season weren’t broken
---
Warlocks are least played hunters are most played lets be clear here thats why no calls for hunter nerfs
---
Yea cause the whole point is to be a fast boi
---
Fuck stomp mechanics
---
Damn that jacket looks amazing. Don't want the icon myself just the jacket. Gl to the winner :D
---
Geez, relax, what's your deal? I'm annoyed that they've removed being able to choose which forge you use for absolutely no benefit except to force you to do what they want, so I called it a feature in inverted commas. Features are supposed to be good, but this isn't.
---
Being a warlock main it made me really sad because we had full arms in destiny 1 but you just gotta live with it rest in peace my massive shoulder warlock
---
I refuse to let go of my Mida. 
---
Even if all I do nowdays is use Misfit (PVE) or Claws ( PVP )
---
It's not shit just because you hate it. In fact a lot of people liked that.
---
Tip use handcannons, bows , shotguns, or snipers (or the recluse/pulse rifles) as they are the best
---
What handcannon is that?
---
They’re like a 3 Tap if you have Levaithans breath
---
Right, but the first shot never staggered it. My fireteam was shouting "stun it, stun it!" but it never worked the first time.
---
If I had platinum I would give it to you for having me and my brother laugh our asses off, but instead let me give you a comment gold 🏅

これはすごい です!!!!
---
I did the survey, and gave my thoughts on it. I want the OEM to receive a hefty nerf but am sick of the whiners and complainers. But let’s beat a dead horse over and over
---
Low key don’t forget if you aren’t using the mods press G when they are low health. For all our sanity it’s the only way to kill those fuckers with out the mods.

---
Have you tried different weapons ? 
---
When I started playing, I got shredded in the Crucible. Mostly because the stuff I used in PVE,, which made me feel like a GOD, totally sucked shaxx's balls there.
---
Try new weapons until you land on one that you have fun using, and it's also effective.
---
I personally love MIDA + Claws myself :x
---
Jesus Christ dude!  I don’t why you think the Holocaust “was a hoax by the Jews” thats awful man
---
Wait. Hand cannons are RECOMMENDED for ogres? What in the hot and crispy Kentucky fried fuck is this?
---
Lol I think it used to increase fire rate which made it better but they got rid of that. Now its just rubbish training wheels
---
Why is no one asking about the 2 red rangers!! TWO!!!?!
---
I love collections, love it even more that my favorite shaders are Uncommon or rare, so they're very cheap as well :P I have about 20 of each at a given time
---
Man I love using my sunsinger dawnblade set
---
No self Rez but still insanely fun
---
Oh gotcha. So I guess isinagis is probably the meta for riven too? It definitely is for the garden bosses.
---
Are you thinking of Moses rather than Noah? It was Moses's life that was threatened rather than his son's.

The explanation provided in scripture for "why would God do it" was that it was a [visual/ritual sign of the inward change he desired](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+10:16;Leviticus+26:41;Jeremiah+4:4;Jeremiah+6:10;Jeremiah+9:26;Ezekiel+44:7%E2%80%939/).
---
There's a lot of interesting symbolism in the Hebrew commands, which [Christians understand to be a type of foreshadowing.](https://www.esv.org/Colossians+2:17;Hebrews+10:1/)
---
They drop after completion of bounties and some of those involve doing forges so coincidental I believe
---
OH GOD QUICK RUN PEOPLE
---
I understand the annoyance of OEM and Recluse. But saying that all Titans are so bad they have to rely on OP stuff is a heavy oversight.
---
A 7th column is a PvP medal in which you rapidly defeat 7 people. It’s extremely rare and hard to get because the largest team game modes are 6v6, so you’re reliant on spawns and perfect timing to get the medal.
---
*dregs promise
---
Your not wrong
---
It's a medal for getting 7 kills in a 6v6 gamemode. It's a reference to another game.
---
actually one is pink lol.
---
3 things for making you a better crucible player.
---
1. Operate within your guns range, really try to minimize shooting outside your damage dropoff zone
---
2. Pick your battles well, if an enemy gets the drop on you, don't try to fight back, get cover, restore health and then give back after them.
---
3. Use the Radar, profile, and strafe. Mist of the gunfights I win in the crucible are because I followed my radar and started shooting before  my opponent did. It takes a bit if practice doing this. If you need help Try using weapons with the Third Eye Perk to get a feel for attacking enemies first.
---
Laughs in outbreaks perfected
---
The more we learn about the darkness the more it becomes a direct parallel to the reapers.
---
I am very interested in the new game mode tomorrow.  But the heavy frequency is disappointing.
---
I like mayhem alot, and think we should spawn with heavy. That said, the heavy and supers in competitive are less enjoyable to me.  I like the gunplay and the 'oh shit it's third round' tactics.
---
The game modes should be what defines it, and I believe I would like a game mode that either takes out or significantly reduces things like heavy and supers, letting trigger pulls and map movement control more of the Gameplay.
---
\*To Infinite Forest and beyond!
---
Good shaders drop all the time. If you want a specific one, use legendary shards. It's a fair system.
---
Needs more yellow, then again I just like yellow....
---
After grinding a ton of comp recently I dont think it's so bad. It forces engagements in the middle of the map so camping doesnt really exist and you need to push the other team back or risk getting 1 tapped while grabbing it. It ads a lot of strategy which I enjoy. Not fun with blueberries tho.
---
Yeah, it happens specifically with the Fire forged cloak from S2.
---
hold the super buttons until you start the bubble animation
---
I really need to do this quest.....
---
Bro you deserve all the medals in the world. I've never agreed with anything more ❤️
---
Arsenic bite and Subtle calamity are the only two world dropped bows. You can get them no matter what. Everyone can earn Hush, but that requires a bow.
---
Lol, all I saw earlier was a blank comment.  I thought that was the joke.  Wow
---
There's an art/fashion tag for a reason, I personally would rather us a to stay in one Subreddit
---
Triple nice
---
Honestly dude I got my ff kc roll to have a stability mw and I can assure you either of those rolls are viable in pvp. I prefer the stability mw over range with that roll in pvp for console, whereas my mw range quickdraw rampage blast furnace has been overall godly for my (12k+ pve kills so far)
---
I'm a vet from D1 who plays a lot of Crucible and this is how it's always been.
---
The PvE stuff is there to make you feel like a god.
---
I'm running a 3700X with a Sapphire Pulse 5700XT. 
---
I'm very happy with the performance on 1440p with a 144Hz  freesync monitor.
---
I had a 94 hunter deleted it to get the d1 ghost shell
---
Hazard of the cast is actually really good for picks in Crucible if you dont get p2p'd with the china coast players.
---
I got a Masterwork handling on mine(i know, reeee, range) and i love it.
---
Oem has always been top tier. It's the wormhusk with even more abilities, and they nerfed the wormhusk into the ground. So why did they even make the oem? It's obviously going to be a problem exotic. 
---
I think they made it KNOWING it would be a problem, because titans are meant to be the easy difficulty of this game.
---
When are warlocks getting a wormhusk type exotic? Lol. Never. Warlocks get abilities to buff others. Warlocks are the hardest difficulty.
---

Ah okay, would saving for shadowkeep be a good idea?
---
[Why are you booing him, he is right](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/279/386/6aa.jpg)
---
For me it is.
---
I mean doing trickshots with the mini hammer is fun
---
I disagree. We need a comp playlist without heavy, we'd see who can really play the game and camping is t necessarily a problem in this game with the way the radar works
---
How many fps u get in Trostland or Titan?
---
I bought the same Gpu as you and the performance was even worse than my 1070. Sent it back and never touching amd gpus again.
---
I’d totally, if we had the option, become the next Taken King. I don’t even care if i get corrupted by darkness.  WORTH IT.
---
Tbh I’m just riding the wave while my main is still meta.  It’s a nice change of pace back from D1 when our options were 1: one arc slam, or 2: the bubble.  D1’s bladedancers *still* haunt my fucking dreams.
---
Maybe that’s because PvP takes skill and PvE doesn’t.
---
Sorry for wanting to do stuff my way. 
---
Just because you do that, doesn't mean that everyone else does. I don't need to know what you do in your free time.
---
Menagerie is a 6-man matchmadr activity in which you can choose the loot you recieve, and for the first 3 runs every week you get extra loot (3 or 4 copies of the item you chose in your chalice with random rolls). Recluse is a crucible pinnacle weapon, Lord Shaxx has a quest for it
---
They aren't exactly "booing" me because the given info is false, most likely simply just because they assumed that the average is massively lower still, which creates that lovely "fuck him, he's a liar, other people aren't higher than me" situation.
---
Gotta keep that bubble intact.
---
claws of the wolf gang RISE
---
Completion of what? Just follow the missions and what it tells you to do
---
Who can really play the game better? Heavy is literally 1/3rd of your arsenal. You just gonna pretend it doesnt exist to measure who can "play the game better"?
---
BigPapa95 reporting in. What’s my canon legal name?
---
Well,  the “unstoppable rounds” from the Gate Lords Eye are only for hand cannons, and those really help against the unstoppable ogres
---
i could get behind a killing a rogue titan
---
Just getting back, any recommendations before jumping in Gambit first time? I'm a crucible player, just haven't thought about doing Gambit yet.
---
Ah I see fair enough - they should've done that but can see why they didn't
---
That looks nice, needs more yellow though. *Everything always needs more yellow*
---
Flair checks out
---
&gt; Warlocks are the hardest difficulty.
---
Yeah, no. Chaos Reach. Nova Bomb. Dawnblade. Three of the best PvP supers in the game. You’re f*cking delusional if you think being a warlock is difficult. 
---
OEM has always been top tier, yes, but the OEM striker combo only rose up in the power vacuum of nerfing Gwisin Spectral and Nova Warp at the same time.
---
What's the point of heroic, better loot?
---
Me sitting
---
If you’re talking about getting the exotics from finishing the campaigns, that’s no longer a thing. Bungie removed it with the introduction of New Light.
---
I’m pretty sure the only reason people are using scouts is for Randy’s.
---
spider wanted bounties have a high chance to drop a bow I believe. Either the Arc or Void Version of the Bow implimented in Forsaken.
---
nope, that’s wrong
---
Note that this quest is still bugged until bungie fixes the quest, which will be tomorrow.
---
Yo they ghosts felt that shit
---
Someone’s mad
---
If they did have matchmaking in Shattered Throne how would you guarantee the blueberries want to do the extra stuff for Wishender?
---
You are better off finding a like minded lfg group that wants to do wishender as well.
---
Well, Loaded Questions have a Bad Reputation of resulting in the realisation of Hard Truths
---
wdym
---
You'd be surprised, me and my fireteam have been using bows alot in comp these days. Hush or wish ender, those plus a good smg are surprisingly leathal if you can pick corners. Also, leviathans breath is especially lethal with oathkeepers. Have even decent aim, its almost guaranteed 3 kills considered the enormous hitbox on the arrow and you can always have it ready to launch with oathkeeper. Plus, it 1hit ko's supers on a direct hit.
---
This was on my warlock and I haven't finished the invitation on this character, however, my ghost said the same thing on my hunter, and I've finished the invitation on her.
---
GAH!
---
Good man
---
*Sleeper Simulant shot ricochets through the Tower*
---
Bro I never pick up heavy and I'd clap your butthole into next year. Yeah I want to pretend it dosent exist in pvp. It is beyond necessary for pve but your giving trash players a false sense of Hope and security with this one shot trash. You wanna kill people in one shot go play the new cod
---
who needs a good hand cannon when you got a compressed firework on a stick thats literally launched from metal strings
---
Thx
---
No AOE damage though is there?
---
Most people play with all 3 classes anyway so I don’t understand this crazy loyalty to one class vs another. Like it’s a game i don’t know why people get so upset
---
It's called a BOW
---
Thanks
---
How do you farm it?
---
Oh look its that 1 in 100 balanced matches. A miracle for sure.
---
That’s not broken. That is perfect.
---
No. Btw do you know what blueberries means? It means players that aren't in a fireteam.

After i got to 950, and same as my friends, the seasonal armor started dropped (from wild drops, not from the seasonal pass itself) was only dropping at 750
---
I mean, really. Any pleb in the City that sees her is gonna be running for the hills and yelling for whatever passes for City security. She'd mop the floor with them I'm sure, which would just make things *worse*.
---
No, you are man of culture
---
It is rather silly that people would throw frisbees directly at an arcstrider instead of throwing it at a wall behind them to get the bank shot that drops their health down to 1 light attack from death. Though as long as supers in general keep walking into bubbles thinking they have a chance against the fisticuffs, I suppose that'll be enough
---
No problem. 🤙🏻
---
If you let the shoulder charging Titan get close enough it's your fault. Radars exist for a reason. Only place when Titans can safely use shoulder charge are teamfights when everyone's shooting each other and they don't pay attention.
---
That’s why we have golden guns
---
I dislike the meme because “nobody” saying “nothing” is never the correct usage for the way people use it. But you know, nobody uses a brain anymore. 
---
Why people eat this crap up is beyond me.
---
Usually you can find some of the patchnotes on the several TWABs on the Bungie website. The full patchnotes with every detail come out some time later after the reset tho.
---
It would be Casual or Rocket. 
---
Both work independently. Im a human hunter.
---
You are fireteam in crucible
---
No matter what.
---
I run three bows in comp. thus oathkeepers. Plus my golden gun which I don’t need an exotic for
---
That happened to me while emoting. My warlock has no butt.
---
I can relate me and my friends did the Heroic archeological survey strike and let's just say the ogre ended our run pretty quick...
---
My steam name is "45 rats in a kevlar body suit". I'd love to see that lore card.
---
I thought it was pretty funny.
---
You'd be surprised how many titans are braindead
---
From what I remember they were really good when they first came out was my go to weapon for crucible if 2 hit people
---
C. "Rocket" &lt;clan name, or if it's really long, then an abbreviation of it&gt;
---
I dunno about that.... the man beat Crota with a rock band drum set lmao.
---
Middle tree tickle fingers
---
I think bows are good :(
---
it’s the strike on io, i glitched back there last week and questioned one of my friends
---
Middle tree void, astrocyte verse, lots of discipline, recovery and mobility. a reliable shot gun, your preffered primary. 
---
My favourite way to ape in destiny. You could also use devour (bottom tree) to heal after every kill and go on some rampages. Recovery isnt as necessary with devour but is still nice non the less.
---
&gt;But by far the worst thing is still the fucking titans running at you and killing you in 1punch with 0chance of counterplay.
---
As opposed to a Hunter running at you and killing you in 1 stab?  Or a Warlock running at you and killing you with one swing?  
---
What's the difference?  Honestly?  If you turn the corner and someone's coming at you with a roaming super activated, you're probably fucked.  That's not a Titan-exclusive thing.
---
Congrats man, the titan armor from that raid looks great too
---
If you're looking for your next raid I suggest eater of worlds or scourge of the past. Those two raid/lairs are probably a little more on the fun side while also being significantly shorter
---
Why does that bug you?
---
Blad barrage damage resistance is higher the noav bomb despite a shorter animation, bottom tree arc strider dodge being un-killable especially when paired with wormhusk
---
ngl, i find I'm *much* more accurate (with a controller) with a bow than I ever would be with a fusion rifle. Maybe it's my skyrim reflexes kicking in, maybe it's the fact that releasing the trigger doesn't make me move the control stick like pulling it does. I dunno, but I've noticed I'm sniping things so much easier with a bow than I ever did with a sniper or scout rifle.
---
"Planet Earth needs your help! On the Way! BUZZ LIGHTYEAR *sick guitar riff ensues*"
---
Ok thanks
---
I respect that, I’m just bad with bows lol
---
Titan was the lst choice for my caracter but i dont hate them but now that i have joined the sub i see these oems
---
Aren't you active in CSGO hack v hack subreddits? Bit of irony there....
---
I think would be since given my kill tracker emblem I'd say hunters have been kinda leading the pack there
---
Wish there was a super shut down counter on an emblem
---
Huh?
---
Takes about 10 years to draw the arrow.
---
Its a hard knock life for PC
---
“More frames, more modders” LMAO
---
That wasnt his point, and now youre moving the goalpost.
---
Its ok to not suck bungie off about every decision they make
---
wait wut? I still haven't gotten any of the paid content yet, but was considering it. If the $25 forsaken dlc comes with the season pass, then I'd be much more inclined to get that than I was before.
---
You can keep leveling the artifact for bonuses until the artifact goes away at the end of the season
---
I think eater of worlds is easiest..but leviathan is a happy balance. What I would say is just make sure you have the right weapons for the raid.
---
Yeah that's true
---
Yes and no. You can oneshot basic red bar enemies with melee attacks in pretty much all content but there's a lot more champions, exploder enemies (e.g. Vex fanatics), and shielded or studier red bar enemies (e.g. cabal centurions) in engame content. Enemies will also do more melee damage to *you* in later content and there are modifiers like Blackout  in the Nightfall, raids, etc that will make enemies oneshot you with melee attacks, so you have to keep your distance a lot more. Particularly when your respawn is limited by longer timers in modes like the Nightfall strikes
---
You still have access to the forges. You just now have to launch them from the earth map. Unfortunately you can't choose which one you want to do as they are in a daily rotation. The upside is that you can forge any weapon at any forge now.
---
2 Guardian kills and enemy’s lost 70mots ? How ?
---
"It's what Cayde would've wanted. Wait...Where's Cayde?"
---
Crucible is stupid easy and if you’re not that good play control as it matches you with people your skill. Classic mix will just lead to six stacks full of unbrokens which won’t be a fun time for you especially if you dislike the crucible to begin with
---
My friend went on raidinfo when I asked if it really took 7 hours across two days. It did b we botched the divinity puzzle bc of miscommunication lmao
---
Oh. I only watched that for my characters voice lul
---
One can get shaders back from the collection book, but I highly doubt Bungie will re-add prmenant shaders in that manner.
---
I mean thats just any pair of bows. Things hit bloody hard, its like pairing sniper shots with a teammate with each of you shooting their body. The greater issue here is just the teamwork they're applying, since alot of guns can pull that off. Hush is a solid bow, but if they miss that first headshot they will often lose in a mid to close range battle since the draw time wont decrease.
---
Thank you
---
Platform?
---
They are more attuned to pve than PvP. I feel people would prefer other mods than overload on their chest
---
Yep, but we cleared it and the weekly "how quick can we do it now" runs begin next Friday.
---
I still think you. Can complete the powerful gear. It’s the flashing yellow kinda symbol on some activities when you got o your director or it’s the powerfuls.
---
D1 vet here. I still think this
---
Ok, Ive already run into some stuff thats 3-5 punches but it still seems faster than shooting, reloading and swapping weapons constantly. I will start practicing keeping a distance and being a little more patient with the fights! Thank you!
---
It is because of the sheer number of options that you have at every moment, all the different stats of weapons, mobility, armor sets changing how engagements happen. Theres way more variety in destiny and its what makes it unique.
---
You can go past 900, you just need to aquire powerful gear. You can aquire this from specific activities or prime engrams the drop when you reach level 900
---
Oh, damn. Just when I get it, turns out I don't really have it then. I guess I'll try dismantling it and hope that I get it, not counting on it thought because luck is usually not on my side. Thanks for the info though.
---
While that is true, in my experience bows are by far the worst offenders. I guess it's easier? But damn is it annoying.
---
Did you PLAY D1?
---
Walock main here and lemme tell you montain top recluse oned mask basicly just mwans your brain flatlines and you autopilot.
---
Has anyone played garden of salvation and/or shattered throne? Having a hell of a time and looking for a fireteam that's down
---
Thanks for all the help! I didn’t expect so much feedback. Got a subjunctive with ricochet rounds, threat detector and multikill clip. One of the best feeling smgs I have used. Got a love and death with spike grenades and the boss dps is godly. For the primary I’m working on getting izanagi’s but at the moment I’m using pluperfect.

I have the Borealis, would that be a good idea to take? I never really used it much so I could infuse it up to my level

So is hunter basically not worth using?
---
Your personal soft cap will also increase parallel to your light level after 900
---
i use middle tree dawnblade for the divine protection grenades.
---
Wait. Code of what?
---
My new light friend keeps asking me how they get recluse, and I’ve been reluctant to shatter their hopes and dreams by telling them they have to play comp for it. Every time they talk to me they’re like “yeah I heard that there’s this pretty good gun called recluse (I don’t use mine around them cuz I did the first time we played and they complained that everything died before they could kill anything) and I wanna find out how to get it”
---
I came ...
---
Mainly it’s the weapons that makes a difference but I’m used to invading a lot so I don’t know

The Forerunners. Funny enough, the Forerunners were just as big as assholes and caused the Flood to happen because they refused to accept the Precursors' choice to give the mantle to someone else. I doubt that's the Vex's plan though, the future they simulated and want seems pretty bad.
---
Good luck! Make sure to check with banshee each day as well. Wish you luck!!
---
It still does increase the rate of fire on shotguns, just not by 100%

That’s one of my mate’s post on Twitter btw [link [The ACTUAL ORIGINAL post (https://twitter.com/hive_thrall/status/1186740347814236161?s=21) ]
---
He’s also in contact with mods to deal with you for this Btw
---
The second option, it's only fair to us players who didn't have the info when it got released.
---
Get them and try them. Your experience with them might be different than what you read online.
---
Look for ‘slightly’ ‘moderately’ ‘significantly’ in the wording.
---
the game saw you using a bow so made the strike easier for you haha
---
He is a good player but still also a very overrated one. Theres so many who can do the same thing that also has a better k/d and manage to get recluse and mt without being carried to it.
---
I’d recommend it! It’s a lot of fun. It’s basically  like using a sniper as a hand cannon
---
Music night at the lost sector. Socializing and chilling out.
---
Oh boy, I'd love to see if that warlock is still smiling when he finds out he will have to complete 25 forges and not just throw 50 balls at a forge 😂
---
all I thought of when watching this was https://youtu.be/-dJolYw8tnk
---
That all changes when you get better weapons with better rolls. You can get weapons with a perk like Outlaw for instance that makes your reload instantaneous after you get a headshot kill and/or Rampage that stacks extra damage with each kill you get (this is a commonly sought after "god roll" combo). So keep an eye out for weapons with those perks, even if they're blue, while you work towards endgame and the big gear grind.
---
No one cares
---
I just got this free today on my PS4. Is it a free weekend or is this game now free to play?
---
OH YEEAAAH!!
---
It was just the quiver with the legs that increase the quiver size, keep getting crits and you'll melt him
---
You have reached the soft cap, congrats. The only way to level higher is obtaining powerful gear, which drops from any activities labeled with a yellow circle. IE: weekly crucible. They refresh every tuesday
---
Hunters are simple minded.
---
10k says it was Drifter
---
Word of advice from a fellow PvP newbie, just spam Claws of The Wolf/Go Figure, &amp; either a high rpm hand-cannon (Rose is arguably the best option for new folks) or a kinetic shotgun (One Small Step/ Toil And Trouble).
---
Pulse Rifles have great coverage, consistent point damage, and the recoil is very manageable. I personally climbed from Guardian II to Fabled II in Freelance this week, had an almost 80% win rate and almost never bothered to switch out from Claws of The Wolf (Heck, it's still my preferred PvP gun, even though I have a Recluse).
---
Also, stay away from regular comp &amp; grind Freelance. You won't run into any tryhard stacks &amp;/or pinnacle carries, and even the slightest positive encouragement will make your teammates play like champs.
---
As for Gambit, I'd recommend trying to get even a decently rolled Pillager, and the Riskrunner. Pillager is a surprisingly decent SMG, and it melts orange bars pretty quick if you have Anti-Barrier Rounds on it. Riskrunner is literally an ad-clear God in Gambit, and can get you a surprising amount of sustain too. If you have an experienced friend, farm the Whisper of The Worm exotic Sniper from Io &amp; run it + something like Wishbringer in your Energy slot.
---
Aside from these, i'd genuinely recommend going into private matches to just check out comp maps. Knowing cover &amp; sniping points well enough can get you an easy 3-0 lives lead in a round, especially in newbie hell maps like Convergence &amp; Pacifica. And ALWAYS make sure to check your radar, especially when you're flanking a choke point. A decent bit of distance between you &amp; your target can get you a kill and 2 assists if your teammates can rush a player advantage.
---
Happy hunting.
---
Even hunters can one shot right now... it’s horrible
---
The draw on LB is too slow and clunky, being able to hold it and release the ~~kraken~~Leviathan as soon as you lift your finger is super powerful.
---
Relying so much on being able to get heavy ammo is a problem though.

What's the best legendary kinetic weapon I can use to pair with Riskrunner build?

I said it was to spook you not to have you die of shock.
---
What quest?
---
I just played this world yesterday... damn, it's an endless fight, fight, run, fight, holy sh@t look at them all, everyone super now... and rest.... then start all over again... loved it... but got tired after an hour or so... hand cramp and needed a washroom break... but I will go back for more punishment.. :)
---
It's from buying the Bungie Pride Pin from bungiestore. It's currently out of stock, and you kind of have to be quick 'cause they sell out really quick (within a few hours).
---
I managed to get one. Code was emailed to me immediately after purchase, and a second code was on the package itself so... I gave the spare to a friend :P
---
You phrased it fine. I am just dumb. Misread
---
Easy? Yes. 
---
Obnoxious? Also very much yes.
---
Happy grinding though, at lasted you picked the right class.
---
Yeah me too
---
Hehe "Urea"
---
Thank you that helps a lot
---
You can cancel the draw cancel immediately after hitting reload, you don't have to go to 0% draw. Try it out, there's a lot less downtime than you think.

Keep trying bro. It'll drop eventually.  It took me 200+ runs to get all 3.
---
At this rate I'll get Cursebreaker first. Thanks for the vote of confidence though. :)
---
I'm working on the Red War now. I figured I'd better get all this backstory of all the dead characters being mentioned around town. I did some of the Chalice quest line up til I unlocked weekly chests before i started the Red War stuff with this meanie Ghaul. Thanks for all the great info.
---
Awe, is someone having a rough time.
---
PC police have arrived. Everyone clear out.
---
was playing with 2 randoms and just stopped and stared in confusion for a second
---
You might also not be at 900 light. Your artifact adds power to your level as you increase its level. I’m currently at 949 myself but my artifact has bumped it up to 958
---
Yep, you’re biased. You can’t flush out someone with a grenade because guess what, Titans and Warlocks are the only classes that have one shot grenades. Shotguns just result in trades.
---
Also about exotic weapons that should come back from D1 into D2
---
Never played D1
---
Just needs to learn how to screenshot now
---
Too soon?
---
thank you.
---
Maybe?

Accurate as a laser and only took 3-4 shots to kill. It was amazing.

He is probably farming for the Gambit pinnacle bow.

There's probably an answer in a FAQ somewhere, but will this translate over via Cross-Save? I.e. if my friend buys this on Steam, will he have access to Forsaken content on his Xbox account if he links the two?

Its still nasty and has dps not far from weapons like acrius (a heavy) and lord of wolves (i think it had the highest dps). It technically is one of the best dps weapons but ofc its a really close range shotgun so um yeah it falls off fast and hard but it gets the job done when you want to, ive outdamaged many heavy weapons with it. Also threat level is its brother, very close dps and er yeah threat level is a kinetic so you can use recluse with it.
---
A big problem is that shotguns just arent meta rn but if anyone is using one it probably is one of 3 mentioned (not including acrius)
---
So Izanagi's Burden is especially loved for two reasons: (1) is the obvious Boss Damage dps it can pump out, but (2) is that it's in the Kinetic slot so it can be paired with Recluse.
---
The Moon Sniper, or **Sole Survivor** from Gambit Prime/Reckoning with *Fourth Time's The Charm* and *Firing Line* can both do some decent DPS. pair that with a **Whisper of the Worm** or **DARCI** and you've got a pretty fucking good amount of damage; Whisper actually out-damages Izanagi's by *a good margin* but is in the Heavy slot so you need to rely on purple bricks, but again it's a *super okay alternative*.
---
There's not a lot of good add-clear SMGs for the Kinetic slot; I think Exit Strategy is among the best, actually, so to solve the second problem is a bit trickier if you can't get the Moon Sniper (Tranquility?) and you don't want to grind Gambit for that SMG. You could look for a good Ether Doctor — kinetic Auto Rifle — to pair with a sole survivor.
---
Apex Legends made a Legend based off a real person who broke some speed record in Titanfall 2. The name for the Legend was Octane, not sure what his gamertag was though. 
---
He is forever immortalized in gaming now, though.
---
Could be worse. Since it's survival, in a way there's more lives for you and your hopefully competent ally
---
I love running EP. If any of y'all need runs of it and play xbox, hit me up. I'd be glad to help out when I can
---
Armor 2.0 is a very big step in the right direction, but has the Destiny-as-usual dusting of "why...why would they do this, how can they possibly even think this is fun" on top with the changes to infusion and the "energy affinity" restrictions. Don't know if you'd want to come back for it specifically other than that it makes your old armor basically garbage stats-wise so you get to get it alllll over again and spend an hours shredding most of the stuff in your bank. 
---
Story wise I really liked the spookiness of it but I never understand what's going on in Destiny beyond the broad strokes. There's a haunted lady which is cool and she's apparently mad about being haunted but other than that she just says a bunch of fantasy space-nonsense (like always in destiny), but if you can pay attention to all the gobbledegook space-epic blathering maybe it's a good story too. I *can* say the story is pretty short and ends...very *abruptly*, shall we say, to avoid spoilers. 
---
But I came back and am starting to have fun again after getting over the mental hump of "why do I play this, I hate almost everything about this how do I even get this quest to start, oh my god I have to look up a guide on how to START content, this is the worst designed MMO. Please just let this be the last chore list till I can go play the game..." and so on.
---
It'll stop once OEM gets nerfed.
---
It's not a scout meta, because these nerds camping spawn with scouts end up losing every time because they don't bother capping another zone. Thank god they removed clash. Could you *imagine*.
---
I think you can repeat the adventure again if you grab it from Brother Vance.
---
I just started trying out middle tree defender in D2, and I'm actually having a lot of fun with it It just *feels right.*
---
Then, of course, my fireteam shat on it being the middle tree and me not taking the top or bottom. :(
---
I let the hate flow through me and punch my way to victory. I can’t count how many times I’ve been the only titan on a team in PVP and was top of the food chain in kills
---
One thing that makes it much easier is that they're P2P, Which means the cheater is not only one of the people running the server, they have a connection to everyone else's who is in the lobby
---
machine gun
---
What a long ass run.
---
wouldn't that be hmg
---
Cheaters are extremely rare in exchange for better everything else 🙃

*Metal gear salad*
---
I got the glory points but like 14% scout kills and 6% medals
---
Any tips for medals?
---
I thought so too, but he's not selling them. I thought maybe I have to do all of them so he would sell them again (??) but I'm not in a big hurry to try that without confirmation that it will work and all of my googling was for naught.

-complaining that using their melee without a target consumes the melee (I don’t get knives or smoke bomb back if it doesn’t hit something)
---
Acting like I can’t give you a single thing just proves how purposefully blind and/or stupid you are.
---
What weapon is this? I’m waiting to start Randy’s until next week.
---
I have a blast furnace with steady rounds zen moment kill clip and a stability mw, that thing is disgusting as it can be if you're a new light player get this one it's also pretty easy to farm?? In my opinion is the best kinetic pulse.
---
You literally said I hate Bungie and scout rifles
---
That useless tbag at the end tho... Lol.
---
I not going to ruin your experience. Enjoy the story and missions
---
y would u say something so contraversial yet so brave
---
I know, but it seems like the players with higher light consistently perform better than me. Not trying to be whiney, it's just really irritating and wanted to vent a bit
---
Vigilance wing for me thing shreds and heals /buffs you
---
Crown of temptest, storm caller, and risk runner equals death for everything that crosses your path
---
Just like why the fuck does our ghost ask what a warmind is or doesn't recognize the taken signatures on IO.
---
I think they enjoyed the challenge.
---
Wow. I love that!! Awesome!!
---
On most pulse rifles it's a bit of a detriment sometimes. But on Claws of the Wolf with headseeker it's definitely strong, Claws snaps back relitively quickly after the recoil so full auto pulses at chest height pop the perk every second pulse. Love that gun.
---
There are no previous season passes, the undying is the first season to include a pass system in destiny
---
My friend thinks that bows are good doe and brought them into levi. FML In the gauntlet
---
They pop up each week at the reset (I assume that's provided the previous one's been completed), kinda like Invitations of the Nine. Just visit Eris and she should give you the quest, complete the steps, then visit her through the portal at the sanctuary. Some really emotive dialogue from Eris. Then just wait til the reset for the next one.
---
I realise now I may have just bulldozed completely past your actual issue... Lemme know if I did, and sorry if I did.
---
Probably Bc they’ve been playing longer than you therefore are higher light and Bc they’ve been playing longer than you they’re better at pvp
---
if you really can’t comprehend it add an apostrophe mg’s 🤦🏼‍♂️
---
It decreases the time it takes to reload, just like the description says
---
Yeah it decreases it, meaning it takes less time...
---
RNG world drops
---
WHAT DID U DO THIS TIME
---
dude someone already answered the question.
---
jesus 1040 must have took 6 months with the way each level scales up, and would only be useful in Iron Banner
---
Thought so, kept ending at 94k. Thanks for the answer
---
No matter what people whine about on Reddit, in comp it's "if you can't beat em, join em". Research the meta and follow suit. Yes, that means OEM as a titan (although who knows post nerf), etc.
---
You need to have it equipped and the booster coms from one of the season levels.
---
You and I have incredibly different understandings of casual, there's no way in hell I could even get close to that amount
---
Toland isn't mad anymore :D
---
Fun fact about the 2011 Canucks riots: the rioters started setting cop cars on fire even before the end of the 2nd period.
---
Source: I was there watching the game outside and left when the riot cops marched in.
---
Nope if you kill everything the max you can get is 95k
---
Have a search for Eddie hearn GIFs, he's a very gifable man and there's some crackers
---
Ive been within 7k of it. With some super cycling and more masterwork weaponry used it could be done. Most ive had is like 94k within upper 14 minutes.
---
It took me years to start playing Destiny. I had it spoiled by someone just casually mentioning it.
---
Regardless, the whole thing was pretty obvious from a mile away. I'm a critical thinker from a writer's standpoint. Most of D2's characters are cardboard cutouts. And don't get me started on the "deep lore" that is hidden away in the achievements menu. That shit's pathetic. And i don't care to decipher poems either or cryptic writings. The lore should be shown in the campaign which has been pretty much crap except for Forsaken. Shadowkeep was kinda okay but too short. I thought the intro where that creepy woman with the red face was awesome and so scary but we didn't really get anything like that. It turns out to be one of those floating props instead.
---
I mean the whole thing feels like a copy of the MCU in it's tones.
---
The hairy ornament is pretty sweet
---
Lmao. This is hilarious
---
Hey some people will never make it, not everyone is good at pvp. Clearly your not. Its not your teams fault everytime man i solo'd up to 4k
---
Yeah thats what I kept ending at, 94k. Thanks for the answer
---
No 95 about at max
---
Everything drops better gear than your current until 900. After that you're at the soft cap and you'll need to do things that are marked as having Powerful rewards to progress. You'll start seeing that label when you're 900.
---
Here's a list of the activities with Powerful rewards. Not sure how comprehensive it is, since I just hit the soft cap myself.

Titans aren’t bad OEM users are.
---
Much like fighting shotgun apes in crucible backpedal as fast as you can I'd also reccomend a shotgun or fusion rifle for up close work.
---
I feel you, I've been playing a few months and still in the same sorta place! Great fun but I rarely have much of a clue of what I'm actually doing
---
Forgive me if I sound like I’m trying to brag. I seriously am not. But I’ve only ever been killed a lot by one other bow user. I get what you’re saying. Tbh, you’re not completely wrong. I don’t hold my draws for super long, as can be seen in the clips I take. That being said, being able to have the ability to hold it is how I keep my smoothness. It’s all about my play style. That first shot of mine is instant. If I’m deep in shit, I just let em fly. And same. Bow kills make up 35k kills of my 60k total D2 kills (I am good, but I just don’t have time to play a ton). 30k of those bow kills are from one single bow, being my subtle calamity
---
I mean... it could be soft if it wants to
---
My favorite perk. Its for us older guardians with hand and joint issues. Perfect for scouts, sidearms, and pulses.
---
Holy shit lol this is bad
---
If its your first raid and you cleared it in 37 that probably just means you got carried by the other 5 lol
---
“I must go. My people need me.”
---
The most satisfying thing to do in crucible to kill a titan with OEM charging at you with striker.
---
It will be patched tomorrow!

Itll for sure take the right team running with score in mind. I was with 1 friend and whatever rando we were paired with simply running them.
---
THIS IS Uh... I don't have a medal for this. Hang on!
---
I'm so proud of you guardian and I want... you to have this...
---
But why is it like a god roll perk?
---
Hey at least we completed his plan and made him immortal. Sad that he’s just stuck in the old vaults though
---
Honorable, but not intelligent
---
It's in the lore that all Warlocks whisper "0 divided by 0 biiiiitch" to themselves every time they perform a finishing move. Only through intense study and training can Warlocks overcome the power of causality and the survive the Great Divide
---
You really felt the need to post this on both subs? Maybe it would be acceptable if it wasn’t a low effort shit post.
---
Only the end of it goes red and there is no way to use it improperly unless you’re trying to tap fire lol.
---
Grind for weapons with outlaw and Killclip/Multi-Killclip/Rampage. In my opinion still the best perks. 
---
With Outlaw you can reload way faster, it’s like slight of hand in Call of duty.
---
Oh my god what was his name, my friend was running this today a bit as a joke lol
---
Their are ways to power level your alts very quickly, if you want you can look them up.
---
Also I'd buy the weekly warlock exotic from xur on your hunter each week, and store it in the vault, that way you may have some decent exotics when you get around to your warlock, and they'll be higher level armor already.
---
HA! I am new light and I understood that reference!
---
Guess frustration is getting to me, went down to 665 which is the lowest I can get in Brave III, I'm about done utter waste of time I'll do PvP for the Bounties that's it
---
Welcome to the true class! Here, you’ll need your giant shoulders
---
Because you reload way faster and it’s always better to reload faster :D
---
Seriously thou, the gun can make all the difference. Im pretty obsessed with auto-rifles, trace-rifles and maybe sometimes a sub-machine gun as my primary.
---
It's pretty rare that i get a first place on the winning team with about 25-35 kills but once i switched to a pulse rifle that worked for me everything changed! Im almost always in the top 3 now.
---
And for all you grammar nazis out there, YES, I did notice I use the wrong punctuation, so don’t get mad at me.
---
I wish the enemy team would let me do that :(
---
Chattering Bone and Sacred Provenance gang

It's 10 bucks.

Must admit, I do love my Inaugural Address. Sometimes the old ways are better.

That said, Outbreak Perfected is my one true pulse love.
---
I was misseled multiple times, it will kill everyone inside the bubble. It may not kill the bubble but it will die exponentially faster with nobody in it.
