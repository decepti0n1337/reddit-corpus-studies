Agreed. Enjoy the grind and then use that for your next character.

I don't have a seal yet, I'm half way done with Cursebreaker so that might be the first title I go for.

FUCK YEAH I CAN BE A GUARDIAN 
---
New Polaris Lance ornament looks sick!
---
I heard he looks like a buff Phillip Seymour Hoffman...
---
Yeah, I honestly don‚Äôt think you can get it any other way. If he received it without the powerful drop, that may require research ü§î
---
PC
---
Thanks mate
---
This guy plays hunter. 
---
I‚Äôd say D5 after they finally fix matchmaking 
---
LUULLLLLLL
---
If you wait until near max light to complete exotic quests they'll come out as powerful meaning a little higher than your light maximum light. Also, the game counts your maximum light for powerful gear by checking your average of the highest in every slot even if it's not equipped. This means that you can use lower light weapons you enjoy and still progress as long as you keep you highest light of that slot in your inventory.
---
Phrasing
---
Ah, another well-cultured guardian. This pleases me so.
---
Dont use the lvl 30 thing on your first character, itll kinda ruin the experience. (Feel free to on your 2nd and 3rd) and the first thing you'll need to access alot of the content is a high enough light level so Id focus on that first
---
Rasengan, copyright safe thor, and Barney's dick smashing you into oblivion!
---
I'm in a clan called Swords of the Winds and right, it's really active. 
---
Looks great!
---
Any chance you might be able to add me in? I can PM you my tag
---
Congrats! On another note...the crucible seems way unfair to us noobs. I‚Äôm level 14 and every fucking person is at level 50 with like 600 power. I can only get like 1 or 3 lucky kills in a match. I don‚Äôt know why they don‚Äôt match you up with other guardians at your skill level.  
---
Ding!
---
I‚Äôve had no issues with base games but you might need someone else to confirm DLC
---
The gauntlets for dreaming city and last wish gauntlets are amazing. Especially those spikes you can see when you‚Äôre using a hand cannon 
---
What class do you play? Send blockers, Invade, bubble shield over bank (if titan) then kill em when they get cocky and try to kill you, all while draining their motes.  
---
Hunter running gunslinger at 651..I can still get better at gameplay overall not gonna lie but I need to get good enough so I can have some kind of win streak momentum
---
Maybe consider being less of an asshole, and keep in mind that others that are learning?
---
They‚Äôre just ‚ÄúComplete 5 crucible matches.‚Äù It‚Äôll let you know when you completed it.
---
I like the idea, but I would say it should have a low percent chance (5%?) to trigger the voice line for each kill, not every single kill.
---
Always a pleasure to find SovietWomble references in the wild.
---
Whamen have big head
---
Damn. Might buy anyway.
---
Ya. No shit. 
---
You called guardian?
---
Power level doesn't matter outside of iron banner, but at your level you're probably still using a lot of Blue gear, everyone at max level has all legendary/exotic stuff. Makes a big difference. 
---
looks like one of those bobble heads. doesnt look good at all.
---
In advance of the first round, sure. But there‚Äôs like 20 seconds before the next round. That‚Äôs not enough time to look at the prime gear you just earned, delete the blues you got, look at any other gear you earned, transfer weapons if needed, rally to the flag, etfuckingcetera.
---
I know the OP was joking but I‚Äôm having a hard time with your statement. You do realize spectral has the shortest range on attacks compared to other roaming supers right? Also doesn‚Äôt last the longest. 
---
Nice :)
---
No need. They‚Äôre already working on it 
---
Yeah but not everyone looks at that/knows it. Sooo.
---
Done
---
Well they‚Äôre just lowly casual commoners. They‚Äôre not people 
---
Definitely, looks like there‚Äôs gonna be a lot more prime grinding to get any more armor and a lot of sad moments of trying to desperately invade. 
---
Hell yeah you better watch your back kiddo
---
Sounds like you didn't play D1. I didn't either, but I see everyone in the comments saying this and I just want to fit in.
---
Alright thanks for the reply 
---
imo ricochet rounds is useless, I'd prefer AP rounds.
---

me too lmao

That ain‚Äôt much of a hand canon sweetie ‚ò∫Ô∏è

It's ok. I'll try to find one.

I finally got it! After countless hours of pure rage I did it! 
---
Best reference right here folks!
---
This would be the very first time I gave my money to Tess..... The very first time
---
Is this were you store corrupted ether?
---
......how many 
---
Ouch
---
Is it hunter exclusive? 
---
[removed]
---
Real talk though
---
Sounds like Mr Fruit
---
It's so worth it man. Enjoy! And congrats!
---
I'm not really sure what's going on
---
That's high caliber rounds
---
Pretty much all I do in Destiny is PvP. And I do pve to get good weapons for PvP.  But division is different, I've always liked trying to solo the hardest content possible. Division PvP is always just a one build shitshow 
---
There were like 3 builds at the end of div 1 lol better than the start of div 1 at least 
---
Eh, striker and nomad both got nerfed Into the ground and then predator was meta. But before that there were the 1 hit sticky bomb builds and then the 1 hit seeker builds. The sentry with Midas builds in 1.3. 
---
I hope we get things like this for all the subclasses
---
Yea I‚Äôm glad I stopped playing before that shit show lol I came back for the seeker meta though. Never again. Whatever it seems like they‚Äôve learned from their mistakes at least 
---
i would honesty be happy if i could just get a crucible kill tracker on the damn thing
---
The seeker builds made me quit for a while honestly. I hated them and wasn't willing to make one. And mostly yea , I love it so far. Happy as hell they included so many hunters in the vanilla game 
---
Yea I never used it but was very close to deleting the game again for a while during that. Hopefully balance updates don‚Äôt take as long and they don‚Äôt seem to be so far. 
---
oh I imagine the tether one.
---
I hope that if they do something to spectral blades make it ridiculous 
---
Brilliant.
---
Aye, if you look up ghosts, such as Sundance or Pulled Pork, on destinypedia they provide the gender of the ghost. As well as in ghost stories, ghost have gender pronouns they refer to each other as.
---
youre forgetting about the afk script bots too
---
make a super useless for months and then fix it?
---
pretty sure they know what to fix because the super itself is great for hunters who play void and want an aggressive super
---
i wait him to drop it, then summon another one like death maul via his left hand
---
I know and warlocks have a high skill ceiling and those that master it prosper from it. I love it and I work hard and have my fun, but I just would like to see 33% split across characters and not see bungie feeding into it.  I dont need warlocks to be god tier, but I do think alot of crucible would even out if you took away some of these crutches these other subclasses have.
---
I mean this isn't even artificial this is truly difficult
---
Yes
---
If it's one gun in your loadout, yeah. If it's your whole set? 
---
r/woosh
---
Bit of an addition, you don't need to have the title active, just unlocked for him to call you a dredgen.
---
It is actually not that hard, just dont overextend the damage phase. After killing this white dude to start the damage phase shoot at the knights and when the are close enough to hit you just go away. Start running in the middle of the map again and wait for the next white dude to start the next dmg-phase.
---
A general tip is to focus only one knight until he is dead and then go for the next one. The knights are only dangerous if they start to run around after a certain amount of damage taken. You dont want two of them running around, if you spare one you can avoid that.
---
Also pay attention to the active modifiers and use them. the prism modifier is a great example, always use the active element is key there. Be aware that the blackout modifier makes this encounter way harder because the melee attacks from the knights pretty much one-shot you.
---
One hit the axion dart ahead of me and then the second hit my teammate just as he dropped down.
---
Looks cool but bungie can do one for $10 per emote for each character. I shall take a hard pass and spend my money elsewhere on maybe an actual game!! 
---
I've been trying to get my Luna's and recluse but it's so hard since literally all I see is Luna's
---
Yeah there's like a buttload of gangs at this school. They all want me to join them cause I'm pretty good with a bow staff.
---
Dude it's a cosmetic, what's wrong with having to spend a few bucks if you like it so much? It's not hidden behind lootbox rolls and offers no gameplay advantages.
---
Feels bad man
---
Vorgeth is too annoying for me to do solo. I can do the wizards in time, but since I have to use Hammerhead for their shields (because I have no void energy weapons) I can't do that much DPS. I'm gonna have to get a good void energy for the wizards, so that I can have my faithful Black Spindle for the DPS phase. 
---
Either way, gonna be some time before I do it solo.
---
I will avenge Cayde-6.
---
Why‚Äôd they have to make it personal.
---
Neither Tether / Well can 1 shot a high health enemy, that's the difference. 
---
While Nova feels great right now, the super energy return does need nerfing a bit. 
---
Right now Nova is an add clearing + DPS monster, it shouldn't really be both. 
---
You dont know how long ivw been looking for a post like this thank you!
---
Why would anyone want to be a dredgen 
---
Ah shit yea fair enough
---
I see a B button, are you on Xbox? If so I NEED HELP PLEASE IM DESPERATE. I'm never playing comp again after I get my recluse and Luna.
---
And last word (console ads srability +damage buff) +mask WTF
---
Bring Out Your Dad
---
This, once their helmets pop off and their orange glowy brains are showing, they take more damage to the head but are in berserker mode and start charging around.
---
Maybe he's Zavala's older brother and he doesn't want people to find out. 
---
lol, gotta love when people do this things
---
I already know its bullshit so im not gonna bother watching it. Just downvoting and moving along. 
---
I have it. Can post a pic later when I get home.
---
It's my 2nd account, I don't use it that much
---
Sbeve 
---
no you're not, you'll be stone dead in a moment
---
I didn‚Äôt even know people played with their helmet off in tower. It‚Äôs been so long I can‚Äôt even remember my hunter‚Äôs face. 
---
They just need to make a loot box full of new dances that are either memey or just straight up funny 
---
Don't disparage yourself. Getting Dredgen is hard work! You see way more with Wayfarer than Dredgen.
---
Nice job dude!
---
No but I can sacrifice an enhancement core, pretty similar value lol
---
Did I?! Not intended to
---
Nova Bomb has add clear and damage I am not doubting that. I am confused by your insistence that it is always better then every other super.
---
I know but since you arbitrarily established the ability to self buff with Tractor Cannon, ehich Golden Gun can also use since tractor buffs all elemental damage with a higher percentage for void, I choose to counter with a Super that does self Buff even better.
---
And Well does that, all I need is to switch Lunas for Phoenix.
---
Also. to get at the comparison of Skulls to Shards, the main difference is that Shards needed HITS and/or Kills while Skulls needs KILLS. That allowed Shards to be spammed on Bosses. 
---
Everything in that room shoots arc at you. You can easily clear all the Psions and kill all three knights witg riskrunner from on top of the pedestal in the center of the room. Then just jump down pick up the damage buffs and kill her with any heavy weapon. I used delirium.
---
You don't particularly need Phoenix protocol, it just helps in case you can't kill all three knights before your well runs out. In my case the psions didn't duplicate fast enough so my well ran out before damage phase and I didn't have another ready. So I ended up doing all damage just for my healing rift.
---
All of my characters look like shit. Maybe it‚Äôs the same for most
---
THANOS POT!
---
Get to level 20 and then just farm the belladona pulse rifle zavala gives to you by completing 30? strikes(don't remember how much you needed). Pick something legendary for close or long range for energy slot(whatever you feel the most comfortable with) and you're good to go in weapons. Next week you'll be able to get thunderlord for heavy with a quest.
---
Armor just use a legendary you like.
---
I used trust, if you can hit your headshots first it‚Äôs a big advantage 
---
&gt;Yeah its lame but its completely cosmetic and it supports bungie now that they're free from  activision. I dont mind as long as its not pay to win.
---
This is how I feel. I'd prefer the Thorn ornament (which I love) be available in regular Eververse engrams, but Eververse is pretty generous for free, so I'm okay with the occasional paid-only cosmetics. 
---
I know my hunter does. I rushed through the character creator not knowing what I was doing. Didn‚Äôt know I couldn‚Äôt change it. 
---
This guy has been through hell and back, killed gods and crazy cultist. And I still don‚Äôt like lookin at his face 
---
If the Luna has a 2 tap Ttk of 0.33, then wouldn‚Äôt that mean a 3 tap will happen in 0.495? since a 2 tap happening in 0.33 means 1 bullet per 0.165 seconds? 
---
Just an example of a move being used everywhere. Not falling for that crap.
---
On full curse weeks in the Dreaming City, complete the Blind well challenge Petra gives you and go with your offering to the oracle offering. A white portal opens up to the Queens court.
---
Too bad I don't have a trust, I'm currently using last word because of the fire rate advantage
---
Sweet thanks. What do you mean by ‚Äúfarm‚Äù?
---
can you actually flip it?
---
same
---
Guardian centipede
---
Here we go, you finally used "salt" term. From that point, we have nothing to argue about. 
---
Boy that 600 % increase per player makes me wanna nut arc souls
---
Could've used this while I was using Nova Warp in Crucible for the Thorn quest, but it feels pretty good that Bungie is reacting to this (relatively) quickly. For this brief moment, it feels like maybe they *don't* hate Warlocks.
---
\*Tries to shoulder charge group of ads\*
---
\*dies\*
---
Malfeasance/ace is pretty good to. The LW is good only for when they rush you, not really range. But good luck you got this! 
---
*skull gets removed*
---
OEM doesnt work with supers though
---
I heard that in "David Attenborough". Nice.
---
eyyyy you're a dredgen!  fight like it sister!
---
That guy was using bottom tree im pretty sure
---
He queued into breakthrough. The featured crucible gamemode this week. And it is set up that you can just farm kills in this playlist if you don't cap.
---
Damn that teleport was clutch as 
---
When someone is finally in crusading distance 
---
Is beautiful!!!! And if it were perfect... You would be a machine... And it wouldnt be an original
---
Honestly thought you meant afk in Gambit lol
---
Skreb 
---
I can confirm that these emotes will be available exclusively through Silver Bundles by the names of "Lightning Before Thunder Bundle" (Titan) , "Lightning Rod Bundle" (Hunter), and the "Resting Storm Bundle" (Warlock).
---
The emotes are named "Striker's Patience", "Arcstrider's Patience", and "Stormcaller's Patience" and are class-locked - no Titans with twirly rods unfortunately.
---
Its been awesome. We both play on PS4 and have found a couple communities  on the network we‚Äôve used to find people to play with. He‚Äôs autistic and I was initially nervous that we‚Äôd encounter some toxic players but have been really impressed how chill the destiny peeps have been. 
---
See that entire statement is saying that it's always the Best Super. If it's the Supee everyone would choose if that choice is permanent that would make it the best. 
---
You declaring something irrelevant doesn't make it irrelevant but I'll apply the same logic to your previous statement. You introducing self buff ability as a criteria is irrelevant since it way not part if your initial argument. 
---
Also nice of you to ignore the Golden Gun + Tractor part. 
---
And we only rarely have weapons equipped right? Again you are arbitrarily introducing new criteria to keep your argument intact. 
---
No. I just disagree with everything else.
---
Just my opinion mate. Nothing more, nothing less. I just don't like how that there's a selection of weapons that are clearly more overpowered than any of the others, and that they dominate any PVP game mode. Even if you just want to relax in quick play, you're still gonna see people using this gun being absolute competitive tryhards. I'm not trying to offend anyone, but you have to admit that guns like Luna's Howl are  quite OP.
---
Slowva is the best/most versatile super in the game at this point in time - hands down, no questions asked. My clan and I were in private Gambit Prime matches all night doing damage testing and a nova bomb does essentially the same amount of damage as a celestial NH shot. 
---
E P I C   G A M E R   M O M E N T
---
His name is J√∂t cause you can't spell J√∂tunn without J√∂t and it's yeet or get yote brotherrrrrr
---
dont be such a baby
---
Yessss 
---
But im not quite dead yet
---
I had some dialogue where the drifter was like ‚Äúhey that‚Äôs dirty don‚Äôt piss them off‚Äù üòÇ
---
*yawn*
---
Treasure awaits below, it calls to you, yES?
---
Getting the catalist for that thing is hard
---
It's not super great in pvp but I thought it did alright. I used it for the Thorn quest and it was pretty good. It's made for Gambit, it does extra damage to invaders. 
---
Just a flesh wound
---
Ding
---
Oh, I am not arguing that it isn't good or the most versatile. It's great and wjth the regeneration from Skull it's to easy to use and has no downsides. In fact as I said I'd like a nerf to the amount regenerated with Skulls, but not a cap to the amount regenerated so it is still spammable when fighting a large (10+) amount of enemies. 
---
I am arguing that it isn't in the same spot that Nova Warp was in. Which was just all around great without any additional requirements. 
---
I didn‚Äôt even catch the drifter dialogue in this clip until I had it in Premiere to trim it down. I nearly choked on my drink when I caught it because this couldn‚Äôt have happened more perfectly than it did - hell, you can see the guy looking off at where I used to be and just know that he had *zero* idea of the violation which was coming. 
---
I had 8 motes in hand and my buddies were yelling at me in discord to not do it. Of course I had to get one of them to hold my beer. 
---
I feel like Ace is strictly better than Thorn but I get your point, idk why someone would use Malf over either of those in PVP.
---
I believe that helmet dropped for me last night, it's creepy. What's the rest of your gear? I'm guessing that helmet is part of a whole set I should keep a lookout for. 
---
You got a good chance of getting one if you do most of the powerful reward Challenges. From my experience, weeklies tend to drop one more often (since Forsaken I‚Äôve gotten maybe 3 from Ikora?) 
---
Pro tip for Gambit, invaders like to use either a Machine Gun and mow you down at range or 1k voices as a ‚Äúfire and forget‚Äù weapon lel. 
---
Considering that his team was going negative whilst he went positive, I‚Äôd wager that the enemy weren‚Äôt complete blueberries 
---
I got a Tap the Trigger with Mulligan +  Armor pierce hammerhead, with stability masterwork. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
This thing is a sniper in crucible. It's awesome. 
---
Holy shit.
---
Hell yeah!!
---
That's like 50% of why I want it; I was just complaining about this yesterday. Popping menus faster would open up soooo many strategic possibilities.
---
NO NOT GWISIN
---
Yes cause Bungie surely decides what Xur sells. Totally not random each week. 
---
Enjoy it while you can. All the crying about it is gonna force Bungie to nerf it very soon I reckon. 
---
It's great fun!
---
Reminds me of Grand Exchange shenanigans in OSRS.

Better love story than Shaxx and Mara Sov
---
ill mark your user as.. guy who sits on reddit all day looking to insult comment on a posts no upvotes.
---
nothing else better to do.
---
best thing got going for him in life is reddit insults. 
---
shit tier personality immature kid with cringe humor
---
and also under even more cringe that fact that he probably thought hes clever.
---
theres a lot of you running around here on this sub. doesnt suprise me people like you exist on here.. typical reddit user
---
I started playing 7 days ago and I'm 682. Powering up isn't difficult, just time consuming. All youre doing is locking yourself out of a ton of content.
---
Yes gwisn 
---
The Rig, on Titan
---
I'll mark you as guy on Reddit who isnt good at comp and over reacts when people point out how salty he is about it.
---
They cried for months (mostly DestinyTheGame subreddit) for Xur to sell Forsaken exotics. Look at the monster they have created..
---
Come back Guardian ! 
---
&gt; I firmly believe that *all* supers should be tuned to work as well in PvE as does the Slowva + Skull combo, and PvE content should be built around that level of player power
---
That is what I am arguing against. You seem to be forgetful regarding your own comments. 
---
As far as I am aware I am also apart of the Destiny community and considering the amount of people wishing for more content in the vein of the Whisper Quest I'd say your statement is wrong and only reflects your personal and that of a part of the community.
---
Really I bemoan the current state of discussions on the internet, where people cannot understand simple basics of rhetoric.
---
&gt;If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.
---
From the official reddit reddiquette. So guess you are wrong there. 
---
Wheres the rig at? Also cool that youre on your titan?
---
Titan is a patrol zone, The Rig is an area there. You do...Play Destiny 2, right?
---
Np. By the way, that TWAB (This Week At Bungie) is a weekly thing where the devs give us info. It's stickied on r/destinythegame every week, or you can view it on bungies website.
---
Are you trying to say that all of us hunters are just wanting to get gwinsin vest? I'm a gunslinger. 
---
I want to get Izanagi's burdern but I have no clue when it becomes available.
---
haha, just noticed that now. 
---
Lame
---
Now I gotta start playing my hunter and unlock Oathkeeper lol
---
Thank God! The wards are the last exotic I need on my titan! 
---
Did the same thing. Threw myself at it for hours until the first sub boss and finally caved. Fireteam joined on me and we beat the whole thing in maybe 15 minutes more. I had something like 500 kills by the end from all the grinding.
---
Meet guardianletics, my tower locked ultimate ironman. After completing my weekly bounties, I decided to up the anti. No strikes, no crucible, and this time, I have to see how long of a train of afkers I can achieve.
---
It‚Äôs tied to a quest
---
As a Titan main I think the middle tree uppercut should ohko too many times I've gotten hit with that uppercut and just shrugged it off and killed the hunter, feels like I'm cheating.
---
If you do 2 powerful frames on 3 characters every week you whould have more than a 100
---
if you still need help i would love to help you out
---
I think it might be tied to a bounty possibly, because Lord of Wolves also states that it‚Äôs an ‚Äúextremely rare world drop‚Äù
---
Dude, I was going to say that...
---
Oh, true, I forget people play 3 characters, ha
---
How long is the quest? 
---
Any hunter with a brain.
---
Depends on if you have a Rare Bounty right now or not.
---
Either that or a boosted fire rate. I want 900 RPM just for fun.
---
Smh. Am I ever gonna get Geomag Stabilizer!!! 
---
Are you trying to say I don't have a brain because I prefer the high risk high reward playstyle of celestial nighthawk golden gun? 
---
Hunters this week in crucible: **I'M GOING GHOST**
---
To start it you need to grab a box from the Volundr forge area, there‚Äôs a cave under the gap you jump across where you find it
---
You can choose your class in lore. 
---
You had me until celestial nighthawk.
---
Chari-chair
---
Sorry, my bad
---
this is the content this subreddit really needs tbh 
---
I can appreciate this. I finally managed to reflect a Jotuun shot back at someone and felt so accomplished.
---
Reset is Tuesday my dude.
---
try recluse in quickplayüòÇ
---
She doesn‚Äôt play lol. I was asking if I could go to orbit at my checkpoint and save my progress. No matter tho, I ended up dying in the most embarrassing way possible so the whole run is kaput. 
---
I was using chattering bone, subtle calamity/telesto,hammerhead/ thousand voices .. I have used all kinds of loadouts nothing works 
---
Looks awesome! Makes me wonder what a Scorn shank would look like...
---
Scorn are reskinned fallen. So why not
---
Oh I hope you get another oportunity to do it! :) 
---
I could probably run Wormhusk and the switch to celestial to do damage come to think of it. I run pretty high resilience and recovery. Generally 555 or 665 depending on armor. Using a bunch of Transcendent Blessing... That does help right? 
---
Bungie hates warlocks. 
---
yes they do
---
in the lore the drifter died of starvation multiple times but his ghost rezzed him, and died hungry again.üòë
---
You can kill cabal ANYWHERE but alright, memes gotta mem
---
It's absolutely insane to me that these prices are the norm. These things should be 1 or 2 bucks at most. Christ...
---
Yes but I recommend using 2 super, 2 dodge and 1 other of your choice. 
---
gotcha, thanks for the tip!
---
Yeah, i cant tell if thats a screw up from bungie
---
Definitely depends on your platform. On PC, the thing is an absolute beast with minimal recoil and an insane TTK. On console, the recoil can get out of hand, but the TTK remains the same. Amazing on PC, just kind good-ish on console.
---
And just as I'm about that sweet sweet subclass on my long dormant hunter too! Guess I'm going to have to main hunter in PvP now...
---
The only question that needs to be ask. Red or blue pill?
---
*pssst* Outlast with Demolitionist + Verity's Brow
---
That's only acceptable if you have 6-9 motes to hit 10 for that sweet sweet taken captain. I don't believe in being first to summon always just bc I hate when the other team can just drop captain after captain making the damage phase troublesome. Also on another note this was totally me yesterday, *looks at motes* "hmm only a few more, oh shit I have 10"
---
don't be a snitch, the vanguard lied to you, keot secrets from you!
---
I'll take my walking tank over my skinny boi anyday
---
Enjoy your well earnt 0 triumph score, on a more serious note good job man  :)
---
*peregrine greaves smiles from the heavens*
---
For pvp, either outlaw or feeding frenzy plus kill clip.
---
For pve, either outlaw or feeding frenzy plus rampage. 
---
Feeding frenzy is slightly better than outlaw, since it is activated by any kill and not just headshots. I don't know what sights, magazine, or masterwork perks are generally viewed as "best." 
---
No, those are just achievements. The weapon always has a chance of dropping, but the chance increases the higher your score. 
---
that's a 700 level gear so only 5k glimmer
---
