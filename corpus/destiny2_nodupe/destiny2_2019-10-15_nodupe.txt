Yeah but that's almost what made it fun. The fact that you could complete something meant for so many more people. It almost made it more exciting because if you died, that was the end and no one could revive you. That thought of not being able to come back made it more exciting for me.

---
---
Eyes up, nightmare fuckers
---
When was the update? Today?
---
How about indestructible skullfort incorperated in it?
---
Read the comment below
---
I think I was using the Helios? Whatever that energy handcannon you get on Mercury is. I honestly think playing PvE with handcannons helps a lot with precision kills. Even when your handcannon stops 1 shotting everything.
---
Seems to be just in past hour or so
---
what’s the best loot you could get in the f2p model 
---

---
kinda new to d2 but played a hell of a lot of destiny
---
It even blocks (not reflects) thunder crash. You take no damage and lose no super.
---
I read the entire thread. Stop being a cry baby.
---
You can’t really get any meta weapons besides recluse, mountaintop and wendigo
---
Yeah that's what I like about checkpoints, but then part of me feels bad for just leaving a group because I need to go to uni or work. Also there's not that experience of being able to complete the raid with the one group and form possible friendships with them. I know in the past that's what has happened. But these things probably just affect me and aren't a big deal to others and that's fine.
---
Low. It’s a hard grind
---
Crying and asking for a discussion on balancing issues is hardly the same thing. The destiny reddit proves once again how cancerous it actually is. It’s like arguing politics with boomers on Facebook
---
Honestly that's what I thought they were going to do to give some significance to the armor, it's way better than the opulence they decided on. I mean they really hyped it up as the poster child for armor 2.0 and pretty much dropped it as soon as shadow keep came out.
---
All forges are unlocked by default with shadowkeep.  They are on a daily rotation
---
I’m 909 Light, so I’m not endgame by any means, and haven’t done any raids yet, but I kind of sense that Handcannons won’t be the best endgame class for PvE and that makes me sad because I love using them, same with bows
---
Love it! Well done!
---
where do u get those
---
Look them up they are all pinnacle weapons
---
no its not
---
ok thanks man
---
Thank you!
---
We need a non-super jump of the Hellmouth, if it is possible.
---
Goddammit
---
Geez, I’ve gotta try this when I get home...
---
To be clear (I think it's a sucky marketing trick), it's 4 seasons INCLUDING this one. That's 3 after this one, so you don't save very much by buying them now. You do get a nice ghost and emote though.
---
You're so ridiculous!! I one shot with dustrock blues all the time and I one shot with a kinetic sniper. There's no difference. It's a grenade launcher not a damn bullet.
---
Or is it wave completions? You don’t answer a question with a question. Right?
---
This is a great expansion to one of my points! Although I totally agree that for more experienced players learning to work together and take out Super users is important, hell, my friend basically never takes off his peregrine greaves. So it’s probably better to expand on what I had said. Don’t push alone  when they have Super and position with your team mates to take it down.
---
Outbreak prime and Thorn were big turning points for me. They both showed up on reset and the players just RAN with it. Figuring out the path through the Zero Hour mission with my friends is, to this day, one of my favorite destiny moments.
---
And yet again your miss the point of the post.
---
Thank you.  I do love my emotes
---
Even when i turn it on in the options i still NEVER see anyone saying anything... Other mmos often have alobby where people just talk... Warframe has a "public", one for trading and one for recruit, same with almost all mmorpgs... Destiny? Even though it actually needs a chat since we have raids and group activities that dont feature matchmaking (raids again, and stuff like nightfall etc)  it still doesnt seem to have one... Its not even a toxic game so i dont get why not just enable it (for honor made it opt in manually because of toxicity as example)
---
Interesting I would like to know your results on the strike boss
---
you can easily make fake mobile text conversations online
---
If scout rifles and pulses and hand cannons and side arms 1shotted that would be an issue. A grenade launcher 1 shot makes sense. If nerf weapons were a D!CK you'd be the biggest rider.
---
Git salty.
---
For sure, I will test it out tonight!
---
Okay, thanks for the info :)
---
I'm the exact same way. When I got my bow at the beginning of Forsaken, I was using it exclusively for most of the campaign. I can see bows still useful in Gambit when invading and taking out the opponents from afar. 
---
I'm also looking to find a squad to raid and play nightfall with. I'm power level 907 and play on xbox.
---
Can someone explain Elemental Affinities to me? I honestly can't grasp what everyone is saying.
---
It's implied in the lore that Shin was risen as a young child but the ghost that did it was eventually killed. 
---
When Jaren Ward was killed by Dredgen Yor, his ghost went back to Shin because she recognized that he had the ability to wield the light. 
---
I'm not positive this has been confirmed but it is almost a certainty.
---
so what do i need to get recluse then? The quest is somewhat difficult to understand ...or perhaps im just a moron...
---
V would be valor, G would be glory. To gain Glory you need to play the “Survival” or “Survival-Freelance” game modes. I would suggest Freelance if you’re by yourself because thats Solo que
---
Basically, everything pre-shadowkeep is set to 750 so you can create an account and start playing whatever you want with your friends. That was a big philosophy for Bungie with introducing First Light. Once you start getting into current content, it will start rising sharply.
---
You need fabled rank (2100) in glory points.
---
Foetracer has the same perk lmao
---
thanks everyone for quick responses
---
He was booted off for 30+ min, and like a min after he was booted, me and my teammate got booted as well
---
Edit: I checked their match history and they won the game, so it wasn't a server issue were everyone got booted
---
You need a quest which you only get from killing the Gaul nightmare for the first time, after that you can buy at the lectern
---
Because the ghost was given by the light, which might not be good in the first place
---
except you dont get an overshield, which is what really makes OEM strong.
---
Foetracer heals and gives overshield?
---
Nope. Only my team was kicked. They ended up winning the game
---
No?
---
When will it start rising? After the main campaign and after the DLCs? Because I'm blowing through everything lol. Even Shadowkeep says 750 power level when I'm at 850
---
Cables in glory which only comes from competitive matches. You also need a certain number of wins which can be earned in any mode.
---
This... now this... is the future
---
There's another card where the risen became a warlord and after he is killed for the last time his ghost says something along the lines of, 'I had been so happy to find my one, that I didn't bother to look deeper. He was so tired when he died, being risen didn't help.' implying that the risen just kinda, snapped. The ghost, again, chose not to res him and let him stay dead.
---
That’s the nightfall ordeal, you can still pick from three different nightfalls in the directory to the right of that one.
---
The lord is here! **{-}7**
---
REALLY?! I gotta get me one then!
---
Don't say you aren't an artist, man, this shows genuine talent. Love the design.
---
The first level of Shadowkeep is 760 iirc. It steadily rises up from there. The soft cap for light level (when gear stops randomly dropping above your current light level and you have to intentionally seek out powerfull rewards) hit's at 900. Most of the endgame content is between 900-980 which is a huge gap. Might not seem like it with how quick you're leveling now... but trust me, it will change. ;)
---
Monte Carlo reduces Melee CD with damage, and has a chance on kill to instantly refill Melee ability. Honestly, 100% strength is overkill with Monte Carlo equipped and would be better suited to invest in other stats.
---
900 is the soft cap for light. Do powerful and pinnacle engram challenges.  If you done them wait for reset
---
Nah he finds them on Grindr, trying to hit the soft cap
---
Are you a f2p or do you have any dlc?
---
At this current time no. You cannot have a level 1 character
---
Thanks for clearing that up. If Monte Carlo procs instant melee anyway, I see no point stacking 100 Strength, but it's funny someone has done this to be fair.
---
Good aim but in a close game in surprised the other team didn’t chase the invader after its announced and you got a kill
---
I did all the campaign quest from Holiday in my Titan and didn’t get the sword. Is there someone i should talk to after?
---
Oh thanks that’s great to know. Btw if I’m going to start some of the campaign, or at least non crucible modes, having already done homecoming a while ago, but not much else
---
Bro wtf is this repost, don’t say this is yours.
---
The design is just a blind perdition I did a palette swap of, but thank you anyway, it means a lot
---
Solar, arc and void on your armor pieces. They can only equip certain mods, so if you have a certain elemental affinity you cannot equip specific mods.
---
Random drop
---
Thanks for the sauce
---
I think you need to have the DLC to pass 900. But if not, then do the quest and things to get powerful loot. You can see if an activity/quest gives powerful drops by hovering over it.
---
Nice! Congrats my dude, nothing like spending hours on a boss and finally clearing it.
---
I got a Fighting Lion recently..... but i kind of have it stored in the vault in favor of Coldheart.  Is the Fighting Lion a bad gun?
---
Is that a threat?
---
Shadowkeep gets you the expansion plus the first season pass for free. The next three seasons will be $10 each (unless you buy the shadowkeep digital deluxe edition which basically gives you a $5 discount.
---
Lol he didn't
---
It just needs to have the oversheild removed. Then it wouldn't be broken.
---
&lt;&lt;That kind of titan, they call a demon lord.&gt;&gt;
---
No matter. I'll never be in danger of losing my /r/[redacted] status.
---
Huh that's neat it doesnt even let me link it.
---
Damn that's a shame, I'll probably end up getting the DLC on PSN to do the nightfalls and raid with friends and all the other stuff when I play solo on PC and just buy on PC afterwards when they go on a sale I'll purchase them again on steam, thanks a bunch for the clarification and thanks to the other guy that commented. Cheers.
---
Yeah I find that annoying I wish they just went back to what it was it costs way more resources to infuse now it’s a bit disappointing. Another thing I’m doing is just grinding black armories and stuff like that trying to get god rolls on all those weapons
---
Mostly weapons, like good primaries and secondaries, game knowledge definitely, and Armor too. I'm sorry its alot but I've been out of destiny for a long time and all of this changed suddenly.

The 4 forges used to be on different parts of different planets and you had to walk to each one every time. It was a pain. Now it's in a nice playlist. =)
---
Go to Amanda holiday in the Hangar and pick up the Red War quest
---
That's what I'm saying in the post in here for them
---
Would've been better if he was seen in vex offensive
---
Yeah some games are pretty stable even with ram problems, what you need to do is use the windows ram diagnoser or whatever, 
---
or try taking one stick out and playing, and if that doesnt work try taking the other stick out, and put the first one in and test.
---
Ball vs Dorito. WHO! WILL!! WIN!!!
---
Fighting Lion may be a meme, but it is in no way a joke. That gun is a monster.
---
I mean, I donno about you but, shaxx saying to capture the zones and constantly yelling zone updates and three large letters floating on the map...
---
You’d think they’d get the point.
---
More rewards for ranking up
---
FUCK! I fucked up. I mean you fucked up bigger but I missed a great opportunity.
---
I just found it, lol. Thanks!
---
Yeah I play on Xbox.
---
Okay okay thanks mate. Just one more thing. I’ve just read the patchnote, so you cant get down rank below Fabled, means as long as you get to Fabled you cant get down back to Heroic right ?
---
I just hit 940 and have been playing since launch. I still find great joy in just wandering the EDZ. In fact, my biggest complaint about D2 is that I feel RUSHED to do all this content across three characters every week while also trying to immerse myself in the story and quests for the season. There's so much to do and so little time.
---
I think Iron Banner starts tomorrow, which is a more fun PVP experience, IMO.
---
Hol up
---
He’s not allowed.. for obvious reasons lol
---
Bet
---
It is similar to your life
---
The one's he assaulted go to the garden of salvation for help
---
Ive played PC all weekend and haven't had any problems. For comp, never see anyone using scouts so no problems there. And for qp, I'm also going for randy's so countering scouts is just out aiming them. Not that hard tbh
---
dying to supers will feel cheep for a while, so will anything. at first you gotta use the busted looter shooter guns to get a feel of the PVP here, then you can dumb it down to the fun guns, like fighting lion, a secondary grenade launcher that by all accounts sucks, but can be really fun! and when used right, can rack up some kills 
---
-someone with a month playtime on this game, (not including the first one)
---
It’s faked
---
Just not what I expected is all.
---
I think the ball needs to go where the jade rabbit statues end up or on one of them dish things
---
Yea comp there’s definitely not a problem idk maybe just bad luck for me in QP
---
It's a mystery right now
---
I know i was just foolin lol. I got a good laugh when i noticed
---
in simple words, you are guardian, you fight for other's safe. That's why you fight. Why you become guardian ? It maybe a job with very high salary so you go to do it
---
*Rare footage of me trying to get mountaintop* 
---
Also fun and amazing fact comp gets you 8x the amount of double quick kills I did a quarter of that part of the quest in 2 rounds
---
Nah, recently I've been wanting to grind for it when they fix matchmaking tomorrow (10/15)... and because I'm a person that loves collecting all the stuff and not just because it was good.
---
Submit this for MOTW

Well goddamn here’s my upvote

Also hunters can achieve the same effect with their golden gun activation animation
---
The one from Lance is ok too but yeah go Ikelos if you have it.
---
rookie numbers
---
Yoink my trick now
---
All forges are accessed via the EDZ and the available forge rotates on a daily basis.
---
Hey I'm watching him now! Watching his playlist about The Drifter.
---
Warlocks are great for doing completely pointless things. 👌
---
this is exactly what i did, ah, wish i could go back to season 4.
---
Titans have more dps right bc of the exploit
---
do us all a favor and stay off this game
---
That's stupid. Why did they change it?
---
Wow, can't think of an original comment and have to waste space with this overused comment? Come back to Reddit when you have something of importance to say.
---
Unique to mars
---
Love them! So glad I didnt miss out on them.
---
oh my friend it is
---
That was fucking nasty
---
When its grenadier but you self sabotage for arc conductor and lose tier 3 reckoning for the team.   Too many times
---
Sorry. I edited my comment. I hope it is to your liking u/Some_TS_PLAYER
---
Nice! Lol
---
Which gun is that?
---
I dunno. Lol
---
Thanks 👍
---
I did lol
---
\*Gives thumbs up\* 
---
Thanks mah' dude! Happy redditing!
---
Honestly I just started the game and I’m already so lost.
---
What's your in-game name supposed to even mean? lol
---
Nice lol
---
No
---
Take my upvote and get out!
---
Thank you for putting out some good quality stuff on this sub👍
---
Mine rolled with Hand cannon dexterity and reserves which is a godsend for crucible
---
One thing that you're ignoring is that most of that utility is tied to melee abilities. Melee kills make up such a small percentage of the average players total kills that you rarely ever proc any of those abilities more than once in a normal game. More if you're really trying to go for them.
---
Got the exact same roll on my first try. Went to go farm it and noticed the finished quest in my inventory.
---
Worldline Skating exploits how Bungie’s physics engine calculates momentum and momentum transferring. Using burst glide, sprint off a ledge, and just as you start to fall active Temporal Dash or whatever it’s called and hit your jump button twice. This makes the engine take the momentum of falling, burst jump activation, and Temporal Dash, put them in a blender and hit the “multiply to the power of 100” setting and let it stir for 2 minutes. 
---
Might not be the tastiest blend but it sure does make some fast fuckin zoomies.
---
No that's a solid strategy, what my team does inside is we have 1 person take the 1st set and the other go straight to the 2nd set. Then cleanup  other than that it is all communication and add control!! And above all else be sure you are watching the cyclops!
---
Jade rabbit with the raging lepus ornament
---
The guardian throwing salt onto Eris was hilarious
---
Lol
---
Gotta send the whole shipment back
---
All you should need is worldline, burst glide, and middle tree dawnblade.
---
for "easier access"
---
Makes me think of Dead Orbits mission of nope-ing out of Earth because it's not worth it. Or somethongs coming?
---
U right.
---
Just saw the other post literally like four down from yours
---
Yes
---
Ah yes, whisper speed run I bet!
---
🤣
---
My favorite gun to use in the crucible even after the multiple nerfs
---
Someone made a better recommendation for it, if you don't have direct sight with the marked enemy for like 3 sec or so the mark disappears
---
Also pretty good
---
Glad to hear it 😁
---
What are they doing to matchmaking tomorrow
---
Congrats!
---
Spoilers
---
Thank you sir
---
If your talking about a campaign mission than yes its been removed the legacy campaigns do not reward you with anything anymore AFAIK.
---
This is awesome, I love graphic design, can't wait to see it finished
---
OP combined the momentum of Warlock burst glide and worldline zero's teleport attack to yeet himself, and then for the last bit used middle tree dawnblade's grenade ability that lets you hover in the air
---
It's just a dance tho.
---
tfw you go to 4700 to 3900
---
\*\*tendencies of suicide intensify\*\*
---
Np, got fabled within a few hours but the wins are draining me. I’m at 42%, might just wait until iron banner comes out.

Personally I'd say Chad o Keefe just cause some content from forsaken/annual pass is already available for everybody for free

The freelance comp mode helped a lot. At least everyone starts on equal footing!
---
Wholesome.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
9 times out of 10 when that sort of thing happens in comp it’s a ddos attack. It’s very common since destiny does not protect your IP address.
---
This was incredible, super well made! I love it!
---
as a fellow sniper, after seeing this clip i became rock hard.
---
Report his ass. That’s just unnecessary lol. Everyone is bad at pvp at some point.
---
No that’s just part of shadowkeep.
---
sorry but uh
---
what's a god roll
---
Aah, I miss flying with my sparrow :(
---
They're nightmares. They appeared with the Shadowkeep DLC
---
Ummm yeah
---
D1 vets know that you can do this in the vault of glass raid with the shield. :3
---
It's was more common, cus it used to be purely connection based
---
Madman’s fukn done it
---
i can’t unsee this
---
Nah. Still the same, I may have changed my psn password but not my name. I'm thinking of uninstalling and reinstalling but it's a pain when the game is 80+gb. Struggling to find anyone else who's had this issue.
---
Haha I got hate mail working my way to mine too. Just ignored him and carried on. Went on winning streak after as well. Some people just want to watch the world burn.
---
Fuck 'em.
---
Why did humans get the best default dance emote
---
it's an older emote, but it checks out.  I was just about to bind it...
---
I mean usually you can type in a search engine for Destiny 2 L.F.G. and you will most likely find people willing to help. Oh and good luck with zero hour!
---
I feel so bad for you, depending on what you play on I could probably help you
---
shadowkeep has been out for 2 weeks and people are already SL 100? WHAT??
---
Dude the part where you throw the salt on Eris was perfectly timed and amazing holy shit
---
I need Shaxx as a life coach
---
I'm pretty sure no one would complain if they just deleted the helmet
---
Lots &amp; lots of bounty grinding lol
---
Yo why isn't this at top?
---
There will always be someone to complain about something.
---
This is awesome! How long did it take to make?
---
Hey, if anyone still has a spare code, I'd be greatful to take it off your hands. My job hasnt allowed me any time to play destiny 2, as a coworker of mine quit. I got up to light level 904 before the raid doped and havent been able to be on since.
---
Lol this is cute, if you ever wanna raid or play crucible I’m down
---
Pc
---
Steam name is Dockedcolt
---
Within a week I think
---
Great idea and I would love to see this, but and this is very important, if we get different powers it would possibly make crucible a worse place then it already is, and if we did have 'darkness' guardians we wouldn't be able to play with 'normal' guardians because it wouldn't make sense for them to do a raid or a nightfall together
---
the only utility that he listed that is tied to melee is shoulder charge tf
---
Wow that's really impressive
---
I haven’t seen anything like that. 
---
The dreaming city has little cats you can give a small offering to and if you find them all you get an emblem.
---
Why the floss though?
---
Yeah its cringey to see off of connotation but nobody actually cares about it enough that it affects the game.
---
Just go for iron banner when it drops. There wont be much hate then.
---
Took me 4, which was a nice change after my poor attempts at an optative farm... 17 drops and still haven't gotten my God roll there Dx
---
Dude... that's really cool.
---
Thanks, man!
---
Depends on the map. Close range map... i've chained melee kills like crazy.
---
I knowww lol I was surprised myself when I noticed her reaction. 😆
---
Yoo... what's more toxic the fortnite community or this fucktard
---
That's actually really cool.
---
We haven't done Shadowkeep yet, guess that explains something.
---
Just keep playing man. Ignore the assholes online. It's just a game anyways. No point in losing your shit over it
---
Yo, the vex milk to break dancing titan..  SHIT WAS LIT
---
AND HE STICKS THE LANDING OH MY GOD,.... THISIS THE FIRST TIKE IN HISTORY SOMEBODY HAS LANDED THE DJSJFKSJFDODNFKSMDJD
---
i appreciate the kind words comrade
---
Lol. Oh well.  Appreciated.
---
I've never actually seen anyone die to a Well before lol
---
I'm not denying it happens but normally when we're talking about balance we're talking about what would happen between two equally skilled players. You can definitely get games where you're succesful pulling off a lot of low tier tactics but in most comp games you would not be getting off many -if any- melee kills
---
This but mini sparrow. Looks so dumb and funny.
---
I’d have to agree with the PvP/raid/nightfalls. It might make sense to have new playlists for darkness guardians. I would like to see just a bit of choice in your guardians’ development rather than a kind of cut and paste story going forward
---
Damn go outside every once and a while
---
It’s more like the guardian picks a particular discipline to focus in. Watch a few of the lore videos or check out the lore subreddit. You’ll see a few cases of guardians using abilities from other classes.
---
So you have chosen. Death
---
Nice job my guy
---
There's a certain strike with the floor covered in electricity in some places, and since I run riskrunner in strikes it's now a running joke that if I see anything that counts as arc damage I jump on it
---
Also, fun fact: Vex milk activates Riskrunner
---
That’s what I did. Had the wins already from last season, just got fabled today (hit 2050 last night, then lost five in a row...got on tonight and won four straight)
---
What happens if I use top tree striker and skullfort instead?
---
Watching those Husky Raid videos inspired me to make these. Lol I made a lot.
---
But robot man looks so cool
---
I usually respond “good players are usually able to carry me so not sure what’s up with you” It usually really sets them off
---
Lol hell yes
---
I got my quest when I finished the forsaken campaign when Petra gave me the talisman
---
Yeah, I like using is with bubble titan, it really help get that overshield up when fighting majors
---
They never really "boosted" getting an exotic engram, at least it never felt like it. They were more for xp and now that kind of boost is available from the premium season pass
---
Yeah that would be cool to see, but that would be a lot of work to implement a simple thing like 'darkness' guardians and I don't see bungie doing that, at best I see us making our own weapon of sorrow (like by ourselves completely kinda like what yor did) but not going full dark
---
That would be a dope concept
---
Yeah
---
Thing is I don't have forsaken soooo idk
---
When your doing the thorn quest in the current meta: PvP's haunted
---
Not a crucible person and not going after this. 
---
When I had to get kills for Ace of Spades I used Crimson.
---
Now he is replying it over and over again in my head.
---
They appeared with the Shadowkeep DLC
---
That's probably why then also I thought it was free since the launch of shadowkeep
---
I had the same issue with Mars, but nobody really gave an exact answer. I'm guessing they're on a Flashpoint rotation now which is lame. More lame is that it was never addressed anywhere and player guides for new light players all say they're accessible via the world vendor (vance/Ana)
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Sorry in advance to my team mates in comp.
---
[removed]
---
that is just magical.
---
Shut I just hit 68
---
Are people rename the whole Steam account to make nickname funny just for one game  (・・ ) ?
---
Yes i think they can, dont get why people are downvoting you. I just wathced ehroars video and with tractor cannon ehroar one kneed nokris, while celestial nighthawk didn't, though they didn't use tractor so im not sure.
---
Oh. They groovin

Can you progress your glory rank in iron banner? I thought it was valor

Nighthawk cant even oneshot with every possible buff applied since its not an exploit, titans prolly downvoting bc they dont want their daddy bungie to be revealed that they have a bias
---
I said something along those lines and he said I was “too much dead weight to carry”
---
Accurate
---
Got myself the whisper of the worm sniper Rifle along with 2 randoms, all 3 first timers and had less than a minute left on the timer!! Funny thing is, the taken blight even started right as we joined up on IO so we didnt even have to wait, it was nuts!
---
I don't know if I agree to this. Titan's have a myriad of utility outside of their melee ability, including inertia override (which gives 1 tap potential to strum overcharge, Eriana's Vow, and greatly extends shotgun range while autoreloading), Weapons of Light (the only 35% buff, which gives aggressive snipers the ability to one shot on body), and suppressor nades which are right now the only form of suppression that isn't tied to super or heavy. Also much of Titan utility comes from OEM, where the ability to track is invaluable in competitive. 
---
As a Titan main, I find that the most broken thing about the meta right now is that with the HC nerfs and the changes made to shotguns, the most viable meta is MT-Recluse or Snipers. Snipers are so good with the OEM tracking, as any damage allows for the auto-track, allowing  you to track their peek spots and get easy headshots. MT-Recluse also synergizes as it is the most "ape" way to get kills. You'll take some damage as you MT-Recluse, which means OEM procs, and you get a free overshield from the instant melt you just performed.
---
Wait...
---
That's illegal
---
I thought all guardian were set to 750 light and he has a rocket launcher at 0 light
---
It's not as hard as it sounds, you play rumble and find the afk players
---
I just hit 14 lmao
---
Yea it’s just fun to turn it around. Blame them for ruining your streak (even if it’s fictitious) by not being good enough to carry you.
---
Iron banner time
---
Theres loading zones?
---
Does it can though 🤔 since they want glory match
---
Don’t worry it’s only in for this season, so abuse it while it’s here, or make a better build
---
op can you send me that drifter pic?
---
I don’t get it
---
Quality content Guardian.
---
Visual bug, it treats it as a victory and ups your win streak.
---
I've always been a warlock, but I've also played a fair deal of titan, try them all if you can!
---
Mine has 1-2 punch, slideways which is...fine, accurized rounds, and a choice of rifled barrel or full choke it's almost perfect except the stability masterwork, but after 7 tries for a 1-2 punch I think I'll settle
---
Hunter titan warlock
---
Chaos reach warlock
---
Yea I just started playing I only have played warlock so far
---
same here
---
Brush it off dude. They will always get salty about something. It doesn't matter if you're a hardcore player or a beginner. 
---
Report that guy and keep at it! You only get better by playing. Comp is the best way to learn. You can do it!
---
Yeah he basically wants to be the last person alive when the universe ends so it's less "murder" and more... "affectionate murder."
---
I won't deny tho he's definitely one of the most fascinating "madman" characters I've seen in a long time lol.
---
Apparently ada won’t give the final key‘s blueprint
---
Ok
---
Sorry they aren't prioritizing you specifically
---
All of the guns dropped for me I didn’t even know you needed the frames
---
I main Titan, but I play them all fairly often. No real reason I chose Titan it was just a random good choice
---
They can always just change it again, hell they could change in right before launching the game every time. More power to them I say, shit like this cracks me up
---
Downvoting for the emote
---
Karma suicide
---
You don't want it.
---
No. No you don't.
---
Great, can't unsee it now.
---
how I feel &gt;&gt;  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e\_DqV1xdf-Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_DqV1xdf-Y)
---
But the problem is my friends got it and they all don't have shadowkeep I'm super confused
---
That was lightning fast. A slow mo on that second snipe would be awesome. I can barely catch up with it!
---
I love being able to change your new for free. Ohhh the possibilities...
---
What time do you normally play? Me and a clan mate can get you through it
---
This is fantastic! The Cosmodrome shot gave me the nostalgic feel I'm always looking for. The sprinkling of salt on Eris gave me a good laugh. Very well done.
---
Usually on around this time
---
Titan
---
Ding! Ding! Ding!
---
Who won?
---
Thanks for the suggestion, I'm new to making clips like this
---
Iirc the quest says iron banner gives more progress
---
I cried
---
Warlock was my first but I really enjoy playing every class. Warlock top tree stormcaller. Hunter bottom tree nightstalker. Titan bottom tree striker.
---
The green gear is obsolete, I still have old planetary adventures that award me 0 green gear
---
I’d say the knight due to the servitor forfeiting
---
Change nickname before launching each game... definitely that guys aren't lazy )))
---
Has to be in a Competitive playlist. So yep, Survival.
---
*laughs in pentagram*
---
I used to main Stormtrance lock til Forsaken then I swapped to Well of Radiance.   Now I main a slowva bomb lock with a grenade build using contraverse hold  exotic gloves
---
It’s the same as the cats you give them rice cakes there’s one sat with a cat in one of the lost sectors
---
We can try to help you in the next couple evenings if your free.
---
I've seens tons of conflicting information on if these legacy campaigns give exotics or not, what is the correct answer
---

I'm down

they already gotchu
---
Cry 4Heads 😂😂😂
---
It happens sometimes.
---
100k nightfall is pinnacle.
---
5x ordeals has a known issue where it doesnt grant powerful loot if you've done your strike weekly.
---
&gt;floss
---
downvoted
---
You could have cut that entire conversation out
---
Should the pinnacle reward for 100k not be an upgrade ?/ as it was on my warlock who was a vastly lower light level upon completion ?
---
If I'm correct silver is just a paid secondary currency right?
---
Dude just buy it you might regret it if you don't
---
can't be unseen now
---
I was able to complete it the first week of ShadowKeep on my Hunter, but can’t find it with my Warlock and Titan. I think I started it before the DLC went live, tho. So, 2 of my toons have 1 quest pending in the Discovery line.
---
DID WE JUST BECOME BEST FRIENDS?!
---
If you get 100k you get a pinnacle drop and it will be an upgrade.
---
So if I did the 100k and did not receive my pinnacle piece it would indeed be a bug,
---
What is glow? 
---
Go to an armor piece. Press down. In a box should be a shader option. You can get more through collections under flair. 
---
Some of them, yes. Other times it's killing things with certain weapons etc. 
---
Story missions happen over years of time basically. It is just what happened in the past. (Present for your character.) It gives the world more character and helps you understand what is happening in the world. 
---
When new light came out they did a huge update on the game and made the new starting point 750. They unlocked a lot of content to new players to give them things to do and let them.skip to end game content with out having to spend months grinding.
---
Great work so far!
---
Silver is the premium currency in the game and is mainly only used for season passes and cosmetics in the Eververse store. Although this is premium currency the Eververse store gives no advantages other than buying a ghost that can give a small or some sort of resource boost, but it isn’t noticeable.
---
Love it! Way to put a smile on my face on a early tuesday morning.
---
I like how you’re already calling it light
---
Sorry, meant glimmer
---
1. Glimmer is spent on applying mods/shaders/reacquiring weapons and armor for collections/exchanged at Spider for planetary materials
---
2. If you're in the details page of a weapon or an armor piece press the down arrow at the bottom of the screen to get to the appearance tab, there you can apply shaders and ornaments
---
3. Weapons and armor can be infused to be a higher power level if that's what you mean, nothing you should worry about until you at least reach power level 900 tho maybe even when you get closer to 950
---
4. Yes, a lot of quests will be quite similar
---
5. The Legacy campaigns can be played by getting their quests from Amanda Holiday in the hangar on the Tower destination, Forsaken campaign is on the Tangled Shore destination and Shadowkeep starts on the Moon destination
---
6. 750 is the new 0.
---
My first thought when I saw this was "oh a new exotic?"
---
😁👍
---
Completely forgot about this post. But this was straight /s. lol
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But if this was serious. I'll bring the raid banner, aka the drink cooler.
---
Iron banner awards progress on games won, you'll need to grind comp to get them glory points.
---
Gun and perks?
---
Go to the Tower, and then head to the Hangar, talk to Amanda Holliday, she is how you’ll access the base game’s three campaigns:
---
The Red War
---
The Curse of Osiris
---
Warmind
---
Complete them in this order, and that’s the timeline of the actual game 
---
Then after Warmind you can purchase Forsaken and Shadowkeep if you decide you like the game enough.
---
Link to the story (Finnish): https://www.iltalehti.fi/kotimaa/a/f6700141-6ca2-43ac-9b62-5e8a2cdc9ce8
---
So those weapons are what a neo-nazi used in a home invasion case. Would that fit in Destiny lore? :D
---
Cuz lava?
---
I'm PL 920ish with no dlc
---
Just keep playing
---
You do get stronger gear
---
Glimmer and planet resources are used for everything. 
---
glimmer can be used for bounties, buying things from spider, infusing gear, buying shaders, pulling out gear, and literally anything you do in the game. You earn it just by playing and the cap is 250k. 
---
Planet materials are there for armor and weapon infusion. You explore planets to find their local resource. Ghost shells will help you. 
---
Legendary shards are for infusion and pulling out shaders mostly. You get them by breaking purple gear (legendary gear.). You'll use it almost as much as glimmer once you get into the game.
---
I can elaborate if anybody has any questions
---
Also want to note that the Deluxe package does not give silver the only thing you get out of it is Shadowkeep, an exotic ghost, emote, and a cosmetic set with an exotic rocket launcher.
---
Yup yup
---
"...get on the point."
---
Yeah they changed the campaign for everyone seeing as we all start at 750 light now its the same with starting a new character
---
Slap the like button like yo mama taught you right
---
Oh- okay, thanks! I was a bit worried I was doing something wrong..
---
I love the little details on the weapons in this game
---
I remember when someone finally managed to do this in D1 and it was a huge deal.
---
I can already imagine how that would go 🤔
---
Revoker (the Pinnacle crucible sniper with a fixed roll). Comes with snapshot and the perk that gives you your shot back when you miss.  I had an Icarus mod (or whatever makes you more accurate in air).
---
yeah, they changed the game for everyone. You will always start in the new light introduction, and then all the campaigns are now optional to do.
---
Oh alright- thanks! A bit of a shame in my eyes but I’m just happy I didn’t mess up
---
Okay- thank you!
---
Did the same thing for me last time I tried it.
---
Talk to Amanda Holliday in the hangar for the main campaigns lol
---
Check out WW3, it’s still pre release but the mechanics are a blast and it’s the most hardcore FPS I’ve seen (not including arma)
---
Thank you good sir, much appreciated
---
Get lots headshots with a sniper rifle in crucible.
---
Great, now I'll never not see that face.
---
Okay thanks!
---
Currently at 3500! Hope to be right there with you soon! :)
---
i hate that guy SO MUCH
---
*Takes out picture of Eris*
---
Where my Warlock mains at?
---
69th comment woo :D
---
People would still bitch that they're reskins. Even tho its pretty difficult to make new weapon types and models every season.
---
Where do u get catalysts ??
---
Yes, it's the current season pass, but the lower part where you get stuff every level and there you got bonus xp rewards and exotic catalyst boosters and such. And yeah, bungo sometimes lacks in the information department and well youtube nor reddit can't help you then ;D
---
Farmed this about 10+ times and not a single 1-2-punch dropped. It was non-stop rampage and snapshot.
---
Out of like the 7-8 I've opened, only 1 has had that horrid combo of dust + shader.
---
It's been ships, sparrows, and ornaments mostly.
---
*gets off sparrow*
---
Guardian: **Moons** *vomits* **still** *vomits even more* **HAUNTED** *vomits so much that their armor is filled with vomit*
---
But this is steam, couldnt you just change the name? So this could be anyone who saw the original post right?
---
Hold out hope brother/sister.  
---
The Greaves will find you soon.
---
It's been there since day one
---
I love ad vs ad
---
Sunshot is a good one
---
Too funny!
---
Yeah I get what you mean! 
---
But still if you know what light.gg is, when you go to the god roll finder tab it actually doesn’t show you its weird, you click on a item but it just shows all the stats of that weapon, not what the recommended god roll is, unless I’m doing something wrong
---
They are on a daily rotation now, so have to wait for that one to be up.
---
With catylyst I'm guessing
---
Don’t worry about anything, play your way. But always remember Fashion is Destiny’s real endgame
---
FIGHT FOREVER GUARDIAN
---
They can't kill you if they're already dead!
---
**why should we?**
---
Scorn on the field
---
try to re login and it will drop after, that how it was for me
---
Congrats man. I just barely got Luna and Recluse myself so I'm going to try for Not Forgotten and Mountaintop.
---
Cool, Still better than the old system. Gives you more to grind for.
---
Watching this gave me multiple cases of depression
---
It worked! Thank you!
---
Well, it is more realistic
---
Yeah tried all of them, the only planets left are tangled shore and moon which is forsaken and shadowkeep so positive it’s not there, YouTube shows you need to speak to ikora first
---
Five Nights at Freddy's...
---
Jesus Christ it's Jason Bourne!
---
collections
---
They showed that the season of dawn will have more to do with Rasputin than the vex stuff
---
u/SiegeDancers huh?
---
#WHERES THE VALUS
---
Increase damage on every hit and when you have no Ammo it swings faster
---
Holy shit...
---
The reload on Zaouli's bane was a nightmare...
---
It’s been happening since I installed the game on pc, I’ve been looking for fixes but I can’t seem to find any.
---
In "collections" under your character, go to "flair" and "shaders" and you should be able to re-create it.
---
Yep I hate pvp so much d2 than in d1 am playing on console so my movements asre so stiff I can't aim properly, can't escape, I'm playing as warlock so I'm at even bigger disadvantage, I don't have any fun even if sometimes I manage to win. They had lock weapons in stupid pvp couldn't just make it attainable elsewhere
---
Or Polaris Lance. Or Thorn. Or Ace of Spades. Or *shudder* Eriana's Vow, a gun you know the idiot paid for.
---
Yes add realism in a game with a big white ball giving humans mutants and robots magically powers to fight space Roman, space bugs, space pirates and time traveling robots. But let’s make the shotguns realistic! What shotgun would you suggest to use in PVP Bc it seems the meta is to slide and shotgun
---
Are those stress balls!
---
definietly commander sentinel titan. gotta love being a one-man shield wall :)
---
 They fill up Ikoras weekly challenge, however after that’s done they’re just a nuisance until reset
---
i beat the raid n i dnt want the code so tryin to see if anyone want it
---
I was trying to add it after but reddit wouldn't let me post it
---
F
---
Oh so I’m good with just winning in classic mix then
---
And it brings the god rolls from d1 back.
---
The Engrams in their priority
---
Pinnacle &gt; T1 &gt; T2 &gt;=  Powerful &gt; Legendary
---
But still, do whatever makes you happy, you'll get to 950 anyways, you dont need to burnout yourself
---
Assuming you have the 2100 glory then yes. If not, you need to get there for the gun. However, the wins do not need to be acquired in a comp. Playlist.
---
You should be yeah, just check your percent win a game in classic mix and then see if it goes up, pretty sure it worked with qp so it should work with classic mix.
---
Well... I guess it my opinion. You all are free to feel the way you do for the D2 raid amor
---
U can give them away but I'm not so sure about monetising it
---
Now that's toxic, ooft
---
I’ve seen one in the vex offensive, there’s probably quite a few now
---
awesome
---
Yup. Yup and yup
---
Thanks!
---
And then the primeval gets healed : (
---
Honestly imagining Zavalla with hair is really weird. Do we have any idea what kind of hair he had?
---
Or just nova bomb it. Both of the Nova bombs break it. Slowvabomb breaks it and then rains down the tracking orbs so that if the titan didn't GTFO as soon as he saw the Nova coming it'll both break the bubble and kill anyone nearby.
---
Yeah, I know the first Destiny did a complete 180.
---
Alright, thanks.
---
Much better than warframe. And I've played that shit a lot. Worth playing
---
I'll have to try out the free version first but am absolutely willing to drop 35 bucks if I like it.
---
I saw this before and upvoted it but its not upvoted anymore... hmmmmmmm
---
Ah ok.
---
Does it have anything to do with light level cause I was using a new Hunter to do it.
---
Well, If You're the one responding, which means, you're the one wasting your won time. And I don't agree with you, which gives me the right to state my own opinion. The game is free to play.
---
Pro tip, just jump off the map. The other team is just taking advantage of super build up. 
---
-comp player
---
i had the same thing but from ogre eyeblast
---
500k, jeez that's like a lot of damage. Thanks, I'll keep on using it in boss fights. I was kinda using the sixth coyote exotic cheat armor as it gives an additional class ability and given that i use it a lot as a hunter i thought of staying with it. 
---
So, can i use the chest armor til i get to the final boss then switch to celestial to deal the damage?
---
Nah it's just always been that way.
---
The main story is pretty engaging. But the DLC is where the true meat lies. Run through Osiris and Warmind, and then do Forsaken, it will completely change your view on Destiny.
---
I'm getting Shadowkeep this week so I don't have a review on that yet.
---
ah i head to work at 10 pm lol graveyard shift. i play a lot on weekends tho especially at night. but yeah hmu with a link and ill definitely join
---
Honestly when I'm tired and don't really feel like doing anything challenging and just want to shoot stuff, it's great fun to just go to the EDZ when it's spawning a ton of enemies and just slaughtering them while hopping in a circle around the square. The gunplay is still fun enough, you can grind some materials and occasionally you'll get a decent drop.
---
Sure thing. I won’t spoil the story but the Exptic Quests were fun.
---
Down vote because of that cringy dance.
---
Kind of?
---
Its not anywhere near what it was at it's peak, but the game is in a better place than it has been for a long time.
---
It has many many problems from glitches to unrewarding grinds to poor gameplay tweaks to making everyone new to the game start at the same level as people who have been playing since launch.(im pretty disappointed by that)
---
But the gunplay and music are phenomenal and when you get a good team of people together to do an activity this game can really shine.
---
(The strikes are really awesome if you're not too over or under leveled)
---
It's a seriously mixed bag, man.
---
Uh. I went from 750 to 910 in a week (probably less tbh). I play about 3 hours every day. I focus on doing quests from the various quest givers on the tower. Zavala, Shaxx, the Drifter etc. Honestly you could probably just do strikes and be fine.
---
Wait until you know you can stand on it
---
😂 I kinda face-palmed when he said that. Like, Zavala, that doesn't actually mean anything. It just sounds dramatic. 😂
---
I'm probably getting punished by RNJesus
---
That HAS to be the closest win I have ever seen!
---
Of course it is, the game is not pay to win in any way (unless you want some of the exotics in forsaken or Shadowkeep)
---
Honestly how utterly we continually massacre the Fallen is really fucked up. They're just refugees and clearly some of them aren't that bad, and yet we just systematically and consistently hunt them down murderously. And all they really want is a chance at the Light and to live, too. It's kinda fucked.
---
Wow thankyou!
---
Did it? The pyramid has apparently been in the moon since before the fall, and the traveler only came to earth afterwards, iirc? So humans were already exposed to the dark beforehand and the fall only really came when the Traveller came around?
---
that dance at the end ruins it, you will get no karma from me today...
---
I started playing week ago,and while inside any given game mode or location it is pretty obvious what's going on, I am struggling to get a grasp on what should I do in general. 24h in and I got over 20 quests and even more bounties and got confused. And UI does not make anything easier.
---
Also, whoever designed "party UI" should have a special place in hell.
---
Just keep fast traveling until you find an instance where people are doing it
---
Except who told us that? All we have is history told by not necessarily reliable narrators.
---
Yo! Its free to play, so just try it. Thats much better than if I would tell u that its good/bad :)
---
Oooh like 5 hours maybe
---
I know this is old, but multiple times now, even after the its procced and guns glowing, the fuckers just wont stop. Ive put 9 rounds, all waited and made sure, and none stopped. Fucking frustrating.
---
Your dummy thicc titan thigh taking up the screen as you careened to your death had me in stitches. Great video!
---
that is how it should be, and if you have forsaken you also get the new subclasses and I belive you also get them with shadowkeep but I am not sure
---
Ty. Means I am halfway through.
---
So u don't understand how it works and blame it on the game and other players.
---
Is there a general light level recommendation for raids? Aiming to LFG to try them out, I'm ~920 at the moment and climbing - but I'd hold off if raids are generally 940+ etc.
---
That would also work...
---
No, true titan is bottom tree arc, sythos and thundercoil to clap those booties
---
We are dropping to 60-70 fps, but we are usually running at 120+
---
It isn't really a huge problem, but it is annoying that it isn't consistent. I'm not sure why trostland is so bad when other areas on earth don't appear to have much less going on in terms of objects/foliage/enemies etc. Just out of nowhere huge fps drop.
---
i think there is like 2 more?? but u can no longer get them?
---
Let me rephrase. Any build that doesn’t include  OEM is a true titan
---
You'll get 1000 silver credited to you, enough to buy the next season when it launches.
---
so basically it's a sweatfest that a new light player like moi should stay out of?
---
Actually yes I'm not doing anything wrong it's just rng  and two at the time I was only informed that you could get legendary gear from the event upon completing the heroic version multiple times I came to the conclusion it was basically more profitable to farm non heroic and I still do believe that
---
Sweet, cheers. I don't have Forsaken. Was game sharing with someone for it but not anymore, will be investing in that though, I was up to Dreaming City before I left the game for a bit. Cheers for that.
---
wow, can I join your lobby please??
---
You can earn two ballistic logs per week, you can choose two frames using those logs, when you make then they'll be powerful. You can then keep rebuying the frames, but ONLY the two that you unlocked for this week, and forging them will give you normal drops for your level.
---
mine has hive defeated 100%
---
but cabal defeated is stuck on 81%
---
Oh man, you haven't seen much if this impressed you. Play the campaigns please. This game legit has one of the best skyboxes and visuals i've ever seen. And i played games like Destiny 1 and Destiny 2 hahaha. Just kidding.
---
No it really looks amazing.
---
Someone needs to try shooting divinity at it
---
It's from the game Katana Zero, the track is titled "Delusive Bunker". The OST is full of rad music to game to. &lt;3 [Here's a spotify playlist.](https://open.spotify.com/album/23KCp1w3aJeKdMrqcyodWK)
---
Get out of my head, Charles!
---
Whenever you drop an exotic, it has a higher chance to be a new one compared to an old one; but it isn't a huge change in chance and it doesn't mean you will get the missing one next either. It's just a slight increase and most of the time you will still get exotics you already have.
---
Its rng on what you get
---
The best sword by far! Especially with the catalyst.
---
that rly sucks, since those are the ones i wanna try a build around :/
---
Bayblade Bayblade
---
let it Rip
---
It never fails. First I hear Zavala's voice. Then, it always transitions to "Warp speed don't rainbow read me nigga AAAGH"
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaWa4ScfQXc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaWa4ScfQXc)
---
U and there should be an invites tab or letter symbol somewhere otherwise head to bungie.net
---
Why would you look to mmo games for story. Swtor has a shit story compared to knights of the old republic
---
its like bungie be like: do u want sum rng to ur rng bro? \^\^
---
just keep running everything that says itll reward powerful gear. also, starting a second character helps a lot. i got my hunter to 930 before my warlock who was over 920 for multiple days
---
As papa console once said "pray to the rng gods for that sweet precious loot"
---
Nice crop, upvoted
---
Which subclasses are in meta?
---
Which class is good for PvP?
---
Yea..... It's bad..... It's worse when the damage never catches up with them, or catches up well after they've killed you and probably someone else. 
---
Been having a lot of melee's not connect, damage not taken, really bad jitters and lag. Kinda sucks they're bringing a focused PvP event with the crucible in this state.... And they've still done fuck all for the meta.... OEM arc Titan with oneshot melee, damn near infinite super duration, and broken Crucible only exotic.
---
Only the bottom right one
---
The nine pyramids look a lot like the new pyramid ships 🧐
---
Yep a bottom tree striker titan every time
---
Good decision. I was on the precipice of madness at the end of it
---
They're not powerful anymore.
---
You can get to 900 just by farming public events or the champions on the moon. So you definitely can raise your light level
---
Grow up.
---
No it’s mine go get your own on xurs blackmarket
---
Nah it was just a flick. I do it all the time too. It’s easier to hit your target if you move the scope through your target instead of landing it right on their head. OP just pulls the trigger when it’s on target but continues the sweeping motion.
---
To clarify, the weekly reset is in a few hours. This will refresh all weekly activities.
---
Wowowowowowowow

Huh, cool. Thanks for the reply and happy cake day!

Sorry, your submission has been automatically removed.

Please post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bzjpkr/official_lfg_megathread_v_4/) instead, look at the LFG dropdown menu on the top bar of the subreddit for various LFG resources, or check the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bvr9ex/official_faq_please_read_before_posting/?) for possibly helpful advice on how to find people to play with our advertise/find clans.

This guide should help for most, it's being updated soon to include links for guides on getting the shadowkeep exotics.

Need to find me some rice cakes then!
---
I'm not even sure what site is this, Blink? What does this site even do?
---
O.O Indeed.
---
Double boop
---
It's so much ez now my friend got his recluse in 4 hours of playing comp and laughed at me when I said it was brutal when I got recluse and Luna's howl on early seasons even mntp quest is so much ez now
---
Think of the old campaigns as a memory now. New Light kinderguardians join the game in it's current state - Red War campaign is over, Tower was destroyed but is now rebuilt etc. and Holliday sits them down and says let me tell you a story of the olden days and what we went through, then the new player experiences (plays through) the story through the eyes of veteran guardian.
---
Congrats! I think that’s a 1% accomplishment. The feeling when Dul dies is sooooo good. I wandered around jumping and emoting to myself until the timer expired.
---
Why tf does everybody on this site just immediately assume an OP gives a shit about karma. I'm willing to bet 90% of us here have far far better things to do than worry about some fucking internet points. Quit trying to call people out for shit you cant even prove.
---
The last time I saw OEM... Funny you should ask.
---
My first game of freelance survival yesterday was against 3 titans with OEM. I thought it was hilarious considering the team's are made up of randos. In the last 15 games.... I would say it's been 2 out of 3 titans rocking OEM.
---
Not gonna lie, I said "Oh *fuck*" out loud when I got there
---
It’s def accurate data.
---
Remove whatever you want mate, have a good one
---
What super ability is that?
---
Just delete the folder and install it over steam. Fin
---
Sparrows? Where we're going we don't need sparrows! When this space wizard hits 88 mph we're gonna see some serious shit!
---
That was me too. I still don’t know what I’m doing half the time but I have fun and keep getting gear so I’m not complaining lol
---
Provabaly uses jötunn in comp in every hallway when he cant slide shotgun.
---
At 932 light the enemies stopped showing swords next to their names. 
---
If I went 1 light down the swords came back.
---
Do not spread misinformation. The Uppercut does not oneshot Guardians in the Crucible.
---
Use a website called braytech.org
---
Provide your username &amp; it will show you what you have &amp; haven't got.
---
Ya that's what I was wondering about since exotic armor got mods
---
Wouldn't it have been better if those CoO weapons just got an update? Like random rolls and a second perk slot like all current weapons?
---
That's what most people want.. Then they wouldn't have sucked just in their base form.. Maybe these leaves could have been ornaments for them if you used them enough.. And we could have actual new designs for weapons.. 
---
I dunno, it just could have been much better instead of settling for this..
---
Tbh honest what scared me was during one of the missions where a line of explosive shanks came out of nowhere
---
You need a tincture of queensfoil. Use it from your inventory to go ascendant and it will reveal hidden platforms if you're near them. Follow the pathway that forms to get to the hidden chest.
---
Sweet business isn't amazing for crucible in terms of competitiveness but it's fun af. Rev up and shoot down a lane. Even at 50 light you really feel it. There used to be an item called iron burden that reduced your light by 50 so you could grind out wizened rebuke which has since been unlocked for everyone. At 50 light under you basically have 0 resilience and shotguns/fusions don't one shot in their normal range. Tho iron banner does have "skill based match making" so it should be a better experience than classic mix.
---
Tbh watch [This video](https://youtu.be/GSgP84ictno) really captures iron banner experience.
---
Warlock chaos reach. Middle tree of their arc subclass
---
Maybo not but I was talking about unlocking the questlines for some. Outbreak Perfected in particular.
---
Legit missions to start the legacy content is at Amanda  which most people don’t visit.
---
People could not shoot them or what? No way you can land a shoulder charge in high elo crucible currently.

Definitely felt great finally completing it, I just immediately went to orbit when I saw the triumph pop up since I just didn't want to stay there any longer
---
controlpanel on the computer?
---
As much as I want that, mods on exotics would be too strong.
---
This is too good
---
That's funny. Like it 👍
---
what is tue best way to experience the Emperor Callus Storyline? Is it in one of the campaigns? Or just a side quest?
---
Cringe bro
---
So... I remember reading in the lore, and I'm going to get all the names wrong.  There was a transport ship leaving earth and the solar system.  It came in contact with the darkness.  A woman went out into space, like a space walk to commune with the darkness and was never seen again.  All aboard the ship perished except 9 who escaped.  I always wondered if those 9 people became "The Nine" as in the mysterious beings associated with the Drifter and that are featured in these cut scenes.
---
I'll take a look when I get back home, there was an adventure litrally called honour among thieves, the quest itself says complete honour among thieves on heroic, will just check and hope somehow you're right haha
---
That's no moon. It's a warlock. 
---
I need an X-Wing for a ship.
---
I went back to playing on the moon in D1 with my entire mindset being “Im right above the darkness I’m right above the darkness I’m right above the darkness
---
Ahh alright. 
---
Thanks for the tip then
---
Exactly it used to just have some lightning at the end of the gun and you obviously knew because thats near the reticle anyways. And yeah its like godmode when proced. Especially when paired with Devour.
---
This reminds me of battlefield 3 days. Teammates fighting each other for tanks and planes while my squad races back and forth to 5 objectives over 500m apart.
---
They'll get better, it's not that big of a deal
---
With one eyed mask
---
You ever try shooting them?
---
nice shootin tex
---
that would be very good for the garden of salvation raid boss
---
That’s sad
---
I mean if you've already done it than yea. You won't get much. But certain quests are still tied to campaign completion iirc. You also should still get an exotic at the end of the red war. I'll check on my warlock at some point.
---
is not for everyone tbh *guardian down*
---
Mods are reusable now? So no cost to put them on weapons/amor?
---
And are all mods reusable or just weapon mods or armor 1.0 or 2.0 as well?
---
Okay man, you do you 
---
Even if you don’t have Shadowkeep. All the new features are really cool
---
I for some reason always kill the first super I come across with a melee because they run around the corner and i just spam the melee and one hit them with the hamer melee attack
---
I love them
---
Word.
---
Because if I want to compare mmo, than I have to pick nother one :) All singleplayer games have superior story...
---
just say it... bottom tree striker
---
I see. Thanks for the feedback
---
Just get normal SK
---
i mean pvp is. pve's actually hella fun. also gambit.
---
if shoulder charge goes so should handheld nova bomb on warlocks.
---
Hunters get a crazy ass dodge which is often more helpful than a shoulder charge in pvp. 
---
I get being frustrated but man crying nerf is weak sauce, I'm titan main and I don't even use shoulder charge because its... situational at best.
---
you want a guy? im open! although i dont play crucible/gambit annnd dont really have a clan or dedicated group that i play with. i just go solo.
---
Im proud of my massive shoulders but slender waist
---
I say screw it and run off the edge as fast as possible so they don’t get the satisfaction of killing me.
---
I haven’t played shadowkeep yet but maybe Deluxe owners get early access to them, I think that’s how Taken King was in D1
---
You ever thought about getting glasses that dampen the lights that cause specific types of epilepsy. My uncle has epilepsy and he uses them to play destiny 2. That could be the fix you need.
---
These trees were introduced with forsaken and are now available to any players who own either forsaken or Shadowkeep.
---
When the Orge starts coming, he won't stop coming.
---
He'll drop to the ground and he'll hit the running.
---
I live in Yorkshire and now I'm scared. Thanks.
---
Never be afraid to join in on random shenanigans.
---
Even if it's just a short laugh it's a laugh that the person will remember.
---
Great job man! I feel ya on the Destiny Dad play schedule. (41) Hit me up if you want a steam friend to run stuff with.
---
You only need to purchase either Forsaken, or any version of Shadowkeep for those middle trees.
---
Here's a tweet from Bungie confirming  ["All Shadowkeep players WILL have access to the Forsaken subclasses"](https://twitter.com/illusion116/status/1177323989074698241)
---
Fully encompasses that dorito look
---
ITT: Pople completely ignoring Dawnblade Warlocks
---
Not gonna lie that sucks.
---
Are they unlocked with New Light? Or do you have to buy Forsaken/Shadowkeep?
---
I don’t think anyone is saying that, that being said though your enemies were playing incredibly stupidly
---
New light players can't run the nightfall this week no?
---
Honestly if you want any kind of a positive experience in gambit, you need good weapons. I hate gambit. I play the weekly crap and I'm out until next week. It's quite literally the most hated game mode in Destiny.
---
Titans...smfh
---
I didn't know. It says 750+ recommended. It was the only coop game mode for 4 players we could find.
---
Not as stupid as thinking that the darkness is bad because people say its bad
---
That's not what I am talking about. You used to be able to pull up the map, press E and on the left side of the screen you would see all the milestones to complete for the week. I see the yellow orbs next to each planet that has a powerful or pinnacle weapon reward, but it's time consuming compared to see everything in one neat list like we used have. Again, I might be missing some other function, but I am not seeing it.
---
Better watermark this before ABC news passes it off as footage of war atrocities.
---
Happy birthday!
---
There's a clan on Xbox that goes by this name. Saw them a few months ago.
---
Your season pass will carry over with cross save. You can just buy the reg shadowkeep on pc if you want to play shadowkeep content on pc.
---
I always hated her. Heh, but she made me laugh
---
The multiplier changed form 1.5x to 0.75x after 20 minutes.  Watching the video, the weight differnce (1.5 vs 0.75) was not applied at the 20 minute mark.  He had 98k before 20 minutes and 100k after 20 minutes, so I can only assume that the weight is applied later somehow?
---
It's pretty dumb that if you want any customization, you need to completely reset your character.
---
Just let the new players have this one, it's cute when they think they are being cool :)
---
You’d have to buy it on both iirc
---
They’re unlocked with forsaken, and I believe the full trees are unlocked immediately
---
I did and all his stuff says complete gambit introduction quest which was never given to me. He literally has nothing for me on 2 characters I tried talking to him with. 
---
Is the introduction quest and the draw supposed to just be there?
---
I finally made Shaxx scream.  
---
And I was fully clothed...
---
I am new. You make think it's absurd because you're experienced. Coming from games with matchmaking, I think it's reasonable. Am I supposed to play against NBA players to learn how to play basketball?
---
Titans.
---
I don't know. To each their own I guess. It's not hard to click on a planet and see what there is to do. You might save a second or two. I'm sure it's not that urgent that you need to save a couple of seconds.
---
Through bungie.net you can find the clans tab and search for clans by name there.
---
Disable HDR in the menu
---
I wouldn't mind having a gander at the loot pool myself.
---
PSN is Ewok_Pilot, send me an invite anytime if you want
---
Season pass will transfer with cross save if you purchase the pass on your main account. Shadowkeep does Not transfer with cross save.
---
Well see where you done fucked up is you activated a ranged super then proceed to run right up in his face lol what did you expect
---
I really like the new raid armor though.
---
Yep, Cross save is good across PC, Xboner and PS.
---
DLCs do not transfer so you’ll need to purchase Shadowkeep/forsaken on each platform you want to play that content on. The current season pass will transfer as long as you purchase it on the platform that you characters are originally from. 
---
Example: I use my Xbox characters for cross save, on Xbox I purchase Shadowkeep and the season pass, I jump on pc, I purchase just Shadowkeep and have access to Shadowkeep and the season pass.
---
Happy b day my dude
---
Oof. I had someone else tell me that spire requires you to be on point for the boss. I didn't know it was that hard.
---
Does that include the other three season passes included with the deluxe edition, or just the season of the undying one?
---
Some men just want to see the world burn
---
Thanks
---
Use them to get rolls at your highest power lvl and send them to alts
---
All year 3 season passes.
---
What type of dick do you have?
---
It should be in your quests. You have to build something's to make armor
---
- Transversive Steps
---
- Ophidian Aspects
---
- Getaway Artist
---
- Geomags
---
- Astrocyte Verse
---
- Nezarecs Sin
---
- Contraverse Hold
---
Warlocks have a lot more options than Titans do.
---
you need to buy forsaken dlc.
---
You needed to hip fire it..... that extra second could have cost you the duel...
---
It's looking real good, I'm impressed.
---
Because I wanted to cap a zone? Because I wanted to kill him?
---
Thanks for the clarification my dude! Enjoy the gold lmao
---
Movie of the Week.
---
I dont think anyone in the history of destiny has said that
---
I meant it’s not something I would think of “in a box of old things”! OP must be a tad younger than me.
---
Should get pre order loot and battle pass after first mission from Eris Morn. In Search of answers at light level 760 should be next quest.  Check seasons which is last tab at planets screen to see if activated.
---
I’ve heard multiple people say that. All on console
---
they are handy for light boosting if you get a high powered item.
---
Word for word lol
---
I believe they said it’s broken atm.
---
Oh shit it’s real
---
Depends on what your play style is honestly. My most basic build though is just recovery and mobility. I put a few other random mods in here and there but those two I always go to but that’s just because I like to fly around like a psychopath and need to recover quickly when I mess up.
---
the service revolver from zavala is good for pvp with the right roll and if you like hand cannons. shaxx is dropping power relevant gear until reset today, 10/15/19 at noon CST, or you can get the crucible armor sets if you like the way they look (titan armor looks dope imo). gunsmith can drop erentil (popular fusion atm, long range, slow charge, can map people) and black scorpion (popular for randy's throwing knife quest).
---
You seem like the kind of person that would fit in well with our group.
---
https://www.bungie.net/en/ClanV2/Index?groupId=3434879
---
Yea, that’s been there for a week or so, pretty decent glitch but awful to get around
---
Slug shotguns require a little skill.
---
This quest is insane. I need to do it for the undying seal. It seems to be heavily bugged. I played for hours earlier and i'm on 3%.
---
This guide says getting kills and medals should be easy and should only take a few minutes.
---
[https://www.gameshedge.com/destiny-2-shadowkeep-throwing-knife-guide/](https://www.gameshedge.com/destiny-2-shadowkeep-throwing-knife-guide/)
---
It's not alot to grasp. Watch a video on gambit maybe? It's very straight forward but alot of people don't get it I guess. You bank motes until you spawn the boss. Kill the primevals than the boss. Invade the other team and try to stop them from banking motes. Or kill them during boss phase to heal their boss. That's quite literally it. If you choose to play with crappy weapons nobody can change that but you. You're only going to get better with practice.
---
plus there is no reason to do it since the sleaper catalyst and the emote drop from any chest you can just get the first 3 chests each week and not need to do the boss (which most people do)
---
Too bad they cannot annotate the game mode with "most hated game mode in Destiny." That would have helped us steer clear.
---

What about us bubble titans that shut down supers for the team? :(
---
Might a good idea because the sniper you listed in your op is from the nightfall insight terminus.
---
gravity is not the issue here, its your sparrow front alignment.
---
When I downloaded Shadowkeep without destiny itself it was 90+GB and took a full afternoon to download.
---
the red war?
---
Clever
---
Ah right that makes sense ye so I’ve just like unlocked all the shit that comes with it that’s good to know.
---
I clenched for you...
---
Question of a new player: How often does the game update? And what do updates usually add?
---
Are they saying greaves are op in PvP or in PvE?
---
Because I fucking hate OEM but I'd be happy and shit if titans got more relevant PvE exotics.
---
Every strike should be. But yes, and it’s actually one of the easiest to solo.
---
okay will see if I can get progress on the next one.  thanks for info
---
Yeah man, just because you don't like it the game is clearly shit, as evidenced by its struggle to maintain players and generate revenue. You got em good.
---
Take a break so the they load into other games and you can get new teammates. Or find a friend from another country and make them leader to avoid those people? (Easier said then done, though)
---
If you dont like the game, why do you even play it. If you had even watched the bungie video about shadowkeep you would know that with Shadokeep they decided to go FULL RPG. I bet you haven't played the game before it but it has pretty much reworked from a kind of Fps rpg to a 90% rpg 10% fps. Supers are there because its part of the game. If you dont like it, go play fucking black ops.
---
"Name one other game with supers"
---
Any New Cod
---
Overwatch (which actually handles supers well because they are team coordinated instead of "press button to win")
---
New Versions of Halo(which are god awful btw)
---
Elder Scrolls Online Arena (Their Version of PVP which i do not touch cause thank god they understand PVE AND PVP MODES SHOULD BE SEPARATED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE)
---
League of Legends
---
Paladins
---
etc
---
name another game with exotics
---
Any other MMO?? like huh? you act like the idea of "exotics" is a new concept xD
---
Like Seriously what?
---
The only one you have is "the way destiny handles heavy" because i cannot think of any on the spot but even then that's still not a good argument because heavy should not be handled this way in a PVP spectrum
---
It's a completely different story to share stats from a database between two systems and implementing all the gameplay between two different systems in real time and all it entails.
---
To be fair to that dude, I really like the pve but I think the pvp is dumb and boring. I’m still on this subreddit.
---
Did he head into the boss fight? I've noticed that the zones seem to reset if nobody is in them
---
R Kelly is that you?
---
There's a hug emote. Daaang
---
Honestly they’re a lot easier to shut down than people make it seem. Shotgun melee, counter super, suppression grenade, sniper headshot, tons of options. Just need to be aware of positioning and movements
---
Just wait till you get one character to 950, transfer 950 weapons to Alts, then collect all the unclaimed armor from the season pass. Still, really strange that they capped collections like that
---
More like: "why do I need PSN to play a free online game?"
---
Erentil for me. Ouch!
---
I have the iron banner fusion with back up plan, destiny 1 had a weapon known as plan c, which was a fusion rifle with a perk similar to backup plan so I'm very used to the feel
---
Bud....i play Destiny 2 for the PVE, but because i want to get into doing shit like SpeedRuns and such i HAVE to do PVP because RECLUSE exists which the fact a PVP weapon is the best primary IN PVE is the stupidest shit around.
---
Hello, I used to play Destiny 2 when it launched and finished the "vanilla" content (Leviathan Raid and such), I want to come back to the game but I've noticed several changes (for example I can't upgrade my exotics freely like I used to be able before) and I was wondering if there is a guide for people like me since I am not really a beginner but I am still a bit lost. I read the Y1/Y2 guide here but it mostly covers the raids and such.
---
That's literally my desktop background picture, without the chair. Weird seeing it here.
---
Shadowkeep campaign
---
Nostalgia needs more time to ferment. Try again in 15 years
---
No disrespect, but sadly, you have absolutely know idea what you are talking about and pretty much everything you've said is wrong.
---
Good luck.
---
I just dont play Crucible
---
Leeeet's Gooooooo
---
So you want it. Then go for it. And btw, Im sure since you dislike mixing pvp and pve, you should try the Title Dredgen. I heard its ez lol
---
No because all of that is destiny, the supers in destiny don’t act like coda supers at all, exotic weapons in other mmo’s don’t work the same as destiny as like you said I already have you on heavy, cod your super is your character can’t change that, destiny you can change your super any time in game and your abilities and the exotics in destiny are as they should be, they worked hard to get those exotics so why shouldn’t they be able to use them? Because someone doesn’t wanna take the time to grind for it and would rather complain?
---
comp is great  right now. 
---
nearly all weapons that are not ARs have a place and a purpose. there will always be meta weapons but atleast i can get diversity in my death. Mindbenders, recluse/huck, revoker/beloved, Mida/polaris, and of course for handcannons we have TLW, NF, trust, and and sometimes an ace.
---
This, only works if you purchased the season pass though. You can easily get your alts close to 950 or to 950 with ease.
---
Deathbringer, from a new Shadowkeep exotic quest you unlock after you finish the campaign.
---
Probably wasn't the first take
---
tfw freebois  
---
ight thanks &lt;3
---
Don't worry about the 5 minutes bit that is irrelevant. Me and my friend did the pyramidian nightfall and it worked
---
&gt; share stats from a database between two systems 
---
So why even do that in the first place? My theory is microsoft did that in preparation of a possible crossplay update.
---
Top one is one of my wallpapers but I like it with chair and The Illusive Man.
---
I think the servers are offline for maintenance, if you go to the Destiny 2 forums it has some info
---
Basically
---
HEY DUMBASS THERE IS ADAPTING THEN THERE IS WASTING MY FUCKING TIME!!! Supers and heavy are a waste of fucking time!
---
you talk as if i'm losing to these things?? i'm not pissed because i am losing fights, I'M PISSED BECAUSE IT'S WASTING MY GOD DAMN TIME
---
i know how to counterplay supers and heavy IT'S JUST BORING AS FUCK 
---
like jesus christ how hard is that concept to grasp for you??
---
also did u just say an NPC would be proud?? wtf who cares what an NPC thinks for a PVP GAME MODE!!!
---
Thx
---
Your welcome
---
Not really a spoiler since the majority of us know about it anyway
---
As a I hunter main,I dont like being truthfully called out
---
username checks out. :D
---
Not the point, it’s competitive, not pray that you’re teammates aren’t brain dead. It’s not about whether you have the rng to pubstomp or not. It’s about the challenge and making it feel like comp. but also with placement matches people could smurf and then lose all 10 (or whatever #) matches and then go off. So
---
Shadowkeep I believe.
---
Take a walk outside kid your blood pressure is too high
---
Thanks for elaborating why you shouldn't buy it if you have stronger alts! Forgot to explain it myself.
---
Yeah what the hell is going on here. I just wanna play some ban ban!!
---
dont know what any of those things are
---
Omg that’s wholesome asf
---
It's called an opinion ya moron. I think the game is shit. I'm speaking for myself and nobody else.
---
Well then you definitely have a lot to do with your glimmer then, Guardian!
---
warlocks cant use OEM. OEM makes the neutral game on titan way stronger.
---
*"The only one that could make the shot that ~~mortalized~~ killed ~~Cayde-6~~ that poor woman

I do actually have the title dredgen  i frankly enjoy Gambit because i don't have to deal with PVP, I let somebody else do that whilst i collect motes and kill ads
---

no I dont, I still dont know what they are

Unfortunately, it's just the way PS4 does it's updates. Apparently, it's to prevent corrupted files but I've NEVER had corrupted files from updating on Xbox One.

Top fragging doesn't require you to sweat, I think you need to understand that being good isn't a bad thing. I don't see any fun not trying to get better at pvp and resorting to bitching about people who actually try. And honestly speaking, some matches or even most matches it is very easy to get to the top of the leader board. I regularly use fighting lion and west of sunfall and people don't know how to fight it, so typically I get 46 kills in that match because people don't even attempt to use basic problem solving to counter it. Keep in mind I'm out to have fun and not a single drop of sweat was on my hands after it was all said and done.
---
NASA waa in cahoots witb Bungie all along! The hints were there from the start!
---
They have a high five and a handshake too!
---
Well considering it seems you have only seen what seems to be ~25% of the game, I would hold onto the glimmer for now. It will be useful when you start doing *anything* lol
---
All jokes aside, buy more bounties, it will help with season pass unlocks
---
Either Osiris is coming to the city as a new vendor with this portal or this is going to end very badly.
---
The most fun thing was to do it when sparrow flying still was a thing
---
And the cabal taxi in dreadnaught and al the other fabulous glitches
---
really i didnt know there was that many looks imma get to farming
---
Really a matter of opinion TBH.  I personally think 90% of Hunter Exotics are garbage and the few good ones we do get are nerfed, hard.   Yet some people swear by Hunter Exotics I find to be trash.  PVP vs PvE i guess.
---
Heck, my favorite Hunter Exotic are Stompies, not even for PVP, I just really like the jump boosts.
---
I don't like Fortnight and other games such as Overwatch because there is no chill in those games.  I can't just log in once in a while for a bit of chill pvp action.  No.  It's people like me with little experience against an army of people who have the skills of professional gamers and I don't stand a chance.
---
You should make a fireteam on bungie.net
---
My speeds will be perfectly fine during games but not installing so it might be like that
---
Tsteps and Ophidian are S tier crucible exotics whether you want to admit it or not. Are they as good as OEM? Not at all, but it provides more options for play style than just one exotic. 
---
Any Titan exotic based around shoulder charge is just gonna get you killed more times than it's worth (at higher play)
---
There was a phase where all I got killed by was le monarque. I believe u when u say it's good.
---

---
Just more people are using them for the Randy’s quest. Once people complete the quest I expect they will stop using scout rifles for the most part
---
No. The iron banner is to show our support of the iron lords. They rolled as a crew so so should you.
---
Comp has been so much more fun and balanced this season IMO. There are definitely a lot more viable weapons now than in the past. Sounds like you are well on your way to hitting Legend as well. Keep after it Guardian!!
---
You should’ve gotten it before it was good
---
I WILL NOT FALTER
---
For the season leveling grab as many bounties as possible and do them with friends to maximize xp gain. As for hunter builds/exotics it just depends on what you like to do in the game. Hunter is my main so I could recommend some builds or exotics for different game modes of you want
---
Maybe there's a triumph for finding all the chests that the Trove Guardian leads you to? I'm still learning the new stuff, so it's just an assumption based on how there was triumphs tied to finding all the Ascendant chests in the Dreaming City.
---
Thank you :) I was looking for lore as well as for theorie crafting on gear, skills and so on
---
Except it's also canon
---
Defensive tank Titan makes the Ursa furiosa exotic pop into my head
---
I will do them for sure
---
It has to be the powerful frames

---
Ace of spades is t God tier buts it's a very useful exotic everywhere in the game imo. Now that the animation is better handcannons are sweet
---
What an good comparison...
---
As a Hunter you will always want the exotic boots St0mp-EE5 as well as Orpheus Rig. Weapon types are personal preference but whatever you use you’ll always want a range masterwork. Hand cannons generally want outlaw with rampage/kill clip. Snipers usually want snapshot sights with QuickDraw. Shotguns go for slide shot and swashbuckler if it can get it, 1-2 punch is also very good. Also for the mag slot almost all weapons want either accurized rounds or ricochet rounds, armor piercing works too if that’s what you get. For end game PvE you’ll at the very least want to get Outbreak Prime and Whisper of the Worm. They are the usual go to boss killers and are easily obtainable from their quest lines so you don’t need to worry about getting a lucky drop.
---
If you want to level up your season rank just do bounties. They’re basically free xp so pick up as many as you possibly can.
---
r/sharditkeepit is a place that you can go with weapons you’re unsure about.
---
I don’t unfortunately
---
HAHAH IB has power cap enabled so if you are WAY below max power level good luck man I think im going to set this IB out and im a D1 player. Yea you can play but should you? Im not haha
---
Took me a solid 6 months before I realized you didn’t have to vin diesel your way head on against oncoming Thomas’s
---
If they're all equally bad, doesn't that mean they're all equally good? 🤔
---
I've been dabbling in PC fps games for a few years now. So it wasn't a hard adjustment for me. Practice makes better.
---
I fucking hate you, r/angryupvote
---
Hope you enjoy. I'm on PS 4 with my buddies.
---
Machine guns of any kind.
---
Funny story about the Recluse.  I remember when it was announced as a weapon a lot of players laughed at it, self included, and the consensus at the time was “It is just an SMG with fancy rampage.”  Kind of reminds me of another another weapon that a lot of players said was just a fancy rocket launcher...
---
I know im not supposed to try to counter a super with another. But its too tempting. Seing a nova bomb coming at me. Running sentinel. Ill jump into the nova bomb to block it then shield bash the warlock as he lands. Iv done the same on a blade barrage before. I like running away to wear out the opponents super chasing me before lightingt up mine and let the pac man show start.
---
Why does it look so sad :(
---
But no other class has as many options to one hit. Warlock has one. Titans have 3 if I'm correct. Not fair at all.
---
[slightly better resolution](https://i.redd.it/1nfkwq42rqs31.jpg)
---
You don’t, but you can use them to guarantee a drop at the end of a run.
---
More like titan being a monkey
---
Am titan main myself but i never use meta's like dust rock blue and certainly not sg + melee
---
I think meta players are mainstream sweaty trash with no character
---
I need to start using it again. Ace of spades was my go to for everything when I first got it.
---
Oh ok
---
Agree again. But if the expectations need to be lower, shouldn't the cost also be lower?
---
It's been destroyed I guess.
---
No problem. Go to the fire team tab on the companion app. Make a post and when people join you have to physically look up their username and invite them through your system instead of the app. I forgot to mention that. I hope you can figure something out soon. Try to find a clan or recruit some people into it. That's the best way to play this game. If you were on Xbox I'd invite you mine, but sadly you have to figure this one out on your own. Have a wonderful day and I wish you the best.
---
Its kinda both steam and the devs. 
---
Im pretty sure steam has innate DS4 controller support, but that support only works if the game allows it. Steam allows you to use steam and your whole PC with the controller without any need for a KB&amp;M. But for the game, devs need to provide controller hotkey support. 
---
Bungie really did everything right with the game, theres barely anything performance wise that could be better. Game runs really well on weaker rigs, it looks really beautyfull, it support every possible resolution including ultra wide screens. It allows for very easy controller&gt;KB switch, i think you can plug both in and switch with a single press of a button the game will register which one you used and will switch all icons and hotkeys accordingly. It really shows how competent Bungie devs are, they really are in a league of their own.
---
yup
---
im talking both.  Peregrine being more applicable against pve.  What do Locks have that can 1-2 nearly any boss without even a super?
---
Just not on Tuesday’s until after the scheduled maintenance.
---
AND FUCK THIS PLACE IN PARTICULAR
---
It usually only takes a few hours. It has never been an all day thing. 2-4hours at most usually.
---
Somebody's not playing by the rules.
---
Birthday in two days and no friends :^)
---
He didn't even have to mantle. He had room to spare!
---
Nice edit!
---
What’s wrong with izanagi’s quest? I’m considering doing it soon.
---
Is It Random When He Gives It to You? He has been pretty stingy with giving me anything. I can't even do his bounties because I haven't gotten the introduction quests despite beating forsaken.
---
YES
---
Yeah didn’t you get to choose between riskrunner, sunshiny, and graviton lance in d2 vanilla?
---
Isnt that the truth.. lmao if titan isnt the easiest main in PVP..
---
heh, adorbz
---
Seriously that’s sucks. I know they took rewards away for year 1 story but this is just dumb
---
Because you are literally asking for someone to buy you things...
---
Or you can use an SMG and have the kills count towards the GL quest.
---
the pursuit itself seems just bugged for me, it's insane. I've gotten so many fina blows with GL, but it just won't update or count towards it.
---
Bugtiny
---
Use an SMG. Kills with an SMG count towards the GL quest.
---
Just gorgeous, how much would you charge to make another?
---
No it wouldn’t, they tried that and it sucked. It’s crucible without the light level.
---
It’s also just a mediocre experience as a video game. There’s a lot of battle royales that just are genuinely better experiences. Darwin project was a personal favorite until that flopped, but generally I try to stay away from battle royales anyway.
---
That goes for literally anything in the game or life
---
Use an SMG. SMG kills count towards the GL quest.
---
Different strokes for different folks.  I like it and the added chaos it brings.  I play overwatch too so there are similarities with the ults and abilities there.  It's just not for you I guess.
---
Use SMG
---
I have no idea, this was back in the first couple years of d1. I just know it wasn't the killing machine it was at the beginning when i got it. Just picked back up Destiny with d2 going f2p and im wishing i never left because there's so much content at this point 😂
---
It doesn't mean they should make pvp unbalanced for it.
---
I could ship you one I’ve got rn for $200
---
Just read that getting SMG kills progresses it, idk if that's true but try that maybe?  I'm on my way home from work and can't test this myself atm.
---
I definitely thought it was going to cut to the destruction of Alderaan. Hilarious though!
---
All I have is based off of another users comment 
---
https://reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/dgoe3g/_/f3ercq3/?context=1
---
So hopefully it’s true!
---
Ps4
---
Super tempting, I gotta ask my wife, lol.
---
So, you want me to spend at least 10 minutes to grab this footage, cut it down and then figure out a way to transfer it from my PS4 to my phone or laptop while lacking a cable to do so to upload a 19 second video? Sure, lemme pull some technical wizardry and do that - except I recorded it via my phone and didn't record it on the PS4 so cheers for that 👌
---
Not sure why it matters but whatever
---
I’m confused how he did that...?
---
Today I got teabaged after a Titan shoulder bashed me from the rear. I then solo nuked him in a corner with my Nova bomb. Fuck you.
---
Haha,  thanks!
---
The story probably sounds deeper than it actually is. It's just a small thing to make my Warlock more unique. Some people maybe want to make their Characters unique with the armor they chose or the shaders they put on (both are things I also do with my Characters, for example with the Warlock I try to get most of the Taken and Hive themed items like the Harbingers Echo). For me story is just  the cherry on top, so to say.
---
Go talk to Petra and get the weekly bounty for the blind well.
---
I SUUUUUUUCCCCCKKKKK at PvP, but I also killed 3 low light noobs with one auto-rifle clip at lunch today.
---
PvP is in a shamefully sorry state right now
---
Warlocks have the only ranged one hit that they can also get an over shield with the exotic. Shoulder charge is stoppable by everything including that warlock one hit. Shoulder charge is useless to anybody paying attention. In any scenario you’d be killed by a shoulder charge you’d be killed by a shotgun ape.
---
If titan is the easiest main then how come everyone plays hunters? I’m not saying they don’t have some broken stuff rn, but come on. Wait another month and they’ll be back to where they were before OEM.
---
Ahh that makes sense, thanks. Although the way they use that is still quite predatory, especially towards kids who see all their friends with gear that they might miss out on.
---
my point was that it makes it almost meaningless, there’s not much of a sense of accomplishment when you’re working towards the seasons gear/exotics. i am without a doubt not putting money into it myself, but it just makes it seem less special when anyone can get everything you worked so hard for with absolutely no effort.
---
Wait that's illegal
---
Awesome! Forgot to mention that I'm on PS4. Hopefully you are too?
---
Omolon fusion rifles were my favorite back in D1
---
Happy Birthday!
---
We share the same birthday!
---
Curse of Osiris is part of the free version now. So it most likely reset any progress on the mercury missions. Meaning you’ll have to go back and complete the Mercury story and regular missions before the Heroic ones will be available to you.
---
Congrats to her! I hope she writes us some awesome and fun stories.
---
Walk? Hell nah we raced around on our sparrows honking horns and titan skating everywhere. Had to go waken the hive as quick as possible.
---
To me warlock melee is more annoying because of how slow it is, like it used to be balance by having more range but then they removed that and didn’t add the speed back so it’s just completely over powered in melee fights, but yeah I understand if titans get a better melee since it is melee or close range based
---
Nice work! Looks incredible!!
---
I know, I tried posting it on r/DestinyTheGame but it didn't let me, so I thought that this was the next best thing
---
Everyone: Nerf Titans!  
---
Titan Mains: Nerf hunters  
---
Bungie: So we've decided hunters roaming and shutdown supers are too strong so we're going to give them no armor on super cast or on their actual roam... pardon our dust
---
It's bugged. Smg kills count for that step instead for some reason.
---
I’ve tried zero hour a million times my friend, I wouldn’t be able to do it solo with the gear i have right now
---
Maybe you should be on time.
---
First time I saw that part of my brain knew it was a trap but my Lizard brain kicked in &amp; I snatched it up only for my ghost to tell me that it’s rigged to blow. I yelled "OH SHIT." &amp; threw it all while my friend was laughing his ass off.
---
If it sweetens the deal the cylinder spins and swings out for a printed slug just like the game.
---
Look, I don't make the rules I enforce them. If the rules say direct image only, then it is direct video only. If you disagree with that, talk to the team. The fact you act surprised it got removed means to me you didn't read the rules so maybe go do that before you post again.
---
You know it :)
---
Ill take that in mind, thanks.
---
Yes.
---
Go to mars and start EP. Kill knight in first shadow rift then mop up baddies with the sword.
---
we will, fellow guardian... we will
---
Aight I'll go hunting again, maybe my instance was just buggy
---
Yup you have to do it for each
---
Welcome to the great world of Destiny.
---
But warlocks have the slowest  melee overall. The ranged melee was supposed to be part of the class in the first place .
---
I just got kicked out of the first IB game I was about to win today. Thanks Bungo.
---
It uses sbmm based on stats over glory for matching I’m pretty sure. All my friends whove never played pvp all got matched against really bad players, but me and another friend who have 3.0 KdA in comp have been only playing against unbrokens since 0 glory and I’m almost at 3k now, almost everyone who’s added me after a game is around 5k.
---
Pretty sure Bungie made the damage values smaller. It doesn't change how much damage it does its just a visual change.
---
No an opinion would be "I think that game sucks" instead of trying to definitively state a game is shit. If you can't understand the difference between an opinion and stating absolutes then you probably shouldn't be calling other people morons on the internet. I'll write it off to you being an ignorant child though, since you think Fartnite is funny or clever. You're either a child or an adult with a mental deficiency of some kind, obviously.
---
Respect
---
There are legit reasons why I don’t like the game. But I wouldn’t go and say I hate the game. I don’t like that a lot of fights turn into who can build a tower fast (I get that’s the point of the game), I don’t like the gunplay, I don’t like the amount of bloat the game had with all the crazy shit it added over all the seasons. With chapter 2 it’s back to a more basic game, but the first two reasons are enough for me to not enjoy the game. I don’t hate the game, I just don’t enjoy it. I think it’s a fine game, I think where people start saying “I hate Fortnite” is that people will claim that it’s the best game ever, and people know that it isn’t, or they just simply disagree.
---
Bottom tree Striker Titan OR Bottom tree Sunbreaker Titan if you can understand how to use the sun spots correctly.  
---
Also if you have Monte Carlo by chance use that with middle tree Sunbreaker titan WITH Dunemarchers so you can have linear actuators and hurt alot of people in a group for easy pickins
---
Iron banner my dude
---
I play on steam and i dont have forsaken or shadowkeep. I am really into gambit prime but when i do the reckoning with my weak mote i keep getting titan gear only, i also have a friend who says to access tier 2 and 3 gear you need forsaken. so my question is do i need forsaken to get tier 2/3 gear and if so how do i get tier 1 gear on my warlock. (i am going for collector gear right now)
---
It's bugged you actually need SMG kills
---
Dude I played with “ registered vex offender “ and I felt like I was playing with Jesus himself it was incredible
---
At the end of the day though you'll never see me crying about something in a game because I cant beat it lmao I find it fun
---
Spoiler pls. Wanted to wait to see it till I got home. So thanks for that.
---
Shaders are a one time use. You might be able to buy it again once discovered via the collections tab in the menu. Flair &gt; shaders
---
 No, exotics weapons have fixed rolls but not armor.
---
I can’t count how many of my teammates run up to this thing and get one shot
---
I wish i recorded it, but earlier today in the IB i was sniped on windows court by the erentil (he was on top heavy spawn, i was bottom heavy spawn.) i was in awe
---
“What do you mean? One eyed mask isn’t broken at all!” - The Titans say, as you turn to them in disgust
---
Exotic weapons are completely static, there is nothing random about them. 
---
Exotic armor can randomly roll with its stats, and its element.
---
Ok. I’m not gonna lie...this is the first I’ve heard of the hug emote at all.
---
Even after the SMG kill part?
---
949 with or without your Artifact Power ?
---
Without
---
959 with artifact
---
Idk then
---
You're 949 with the seasonal artifact most likely. Untill your top gear reaches 950, you won't get 950+ gear from pinnacles.
---
Rip, thanks for answering
---
Does this still work? I was trying to titan fly on the other side but I couldn't do it right.
---
No I don’t think so. Cause you have to do vex offensives to get them
---
A Starbucks.
---
Oh yeah, I can see that happening from that distance. It shouldn’t at all happen. Im not sure if fusions need a nerf, or if rangefinder as a perk needs a rework.
---
After the first step its Fusion,Pulse,Sub and Sub apparently the grenade launcher portion wasnt written correctly but it was cleared up on twitter.
---
I'm at 959 with artifact haha
---
If you aren’t using recluse then run a shotty. For boss damage primary run outbreak perfected
---
Took me less than an hour. Mind you, I'm trash at PvP. If I can do it, anyone can do it.
---
I guess it depends on perception. It reads like he's trying to be edgy and cool imo.
---
So wait you are telling a started this quest for no reason
---
That is a shame
---
Ok thanks for the motivation
---
In EDZ, once you complete the initial "Do a bunch of different things" quest from Devrim, you'll unlock a quest called "Enhance!". Completing Enhance! Will get you the MIDA Mini Tool, an SMG that pairs with the MIDA Multi Tool, and this will unlock an Exotic quest from the Tower gunsmith, Banshee-44. Complete Banshee-44's Exotic quest to earn the MIDA Multi Tool.
---
You got this Guardian! Don't get frustrated over it!
---
It was a debate in the first place. I made a statement. Goodbye
---
Same. Not tried Swarm yet, but now I will.
---
Then i don't know, maybe you get more Power if your at the Hardcap of 950. But that is just Speculation on my Side
---
Currently he's in the archer's line. Go from sanctuary to archer's and at the cross section turn right, look to your right by the road he'd near there. It's sort of a clearing and Toland patrol spawns there.
---
The only energy shotguns with one two punch come from gambit prime and the raid Crown of Sorrow. I think you should stick with the kinetic one and think about farming gambit prime for that one.
---
The only key I'm missing is the black armory lock, I have all the other ones already
---
Gotcha thx
---
Well now the nightfalls have way harder modifiers and exotics are “common” loot according to the type of nightfall.
---
You probably want a shotty
---
Except COD in its prime was a good game. COD 4 (arguably the most influential FPS games in terms of design) had a great combat flow, a solid campaign, and a progression system that at the time was beyond addicting. MW2, BO, and BO2 (to a lesser extent MW3) all had solid campaigns with a solid multiplayer experience, and some cool side stuff like spec ops, or Nazi zombies.
---
Then Idk how to help you
---
Thank you friend, I'll go investigate
---
I found him at Archer's Line.
---
Sweet! I'll be free from 7am-12pm (i may need to drop out for like 5 minutes right at 10am though). And again in the evening, like 10pm, though i know that's pretty late across the pond.
---
It's bugged. You can't finish the quest currently.
---
Im really suffering from this. There are sooooo many quests I want to pick up but just not enough space
---
Download the update?
---
A week later you read the patch notes
---
“Buffed Titan resilience. Nova bomb will not kill a full health titan anymore.”
---
Fucking jotunn
---
The names on the tags are great
---
No... You have to buy the DLC for each platform.
---
They also overwork the absolute shit out of their employees to pump out new seasons and cosmetics.
---
I'm gonna cry If that's the case
---
Damn man what a bummer it's been like this for a week already
---
Festival of the Lost perhaps? If they don’t add it then, I will def be disappointed
---
Ive literally just downloaded the game mate
---
How much did the set you back for? Looking to get one of these as a Christmas gift.
---
