---
True true. But if you knowingly hit 69 next season, you can’t play for the rest of the season. KNOWINGLY though.
---
I love the random deaths tho!!!
---
It's not just Gambit, it is PVP in general. We have weapons that are designed to rip apart trash mobs/bosses with ease and we use them on players that have like 200 health. 
---
Destiny would need to add a massive set of rules and balancing changes specific to guardian damage otherwise PVP aspects will always be unbalanced.
---
We lost a composer to this commercial
---
Damn, $100?! It's only $60 here in the US! Not sure how Freedom Bucks converts to AUD, but that just sounds far too expensive for a DLC. I'd just wait for it to go on sale or something. That's what I did with Forsaken, and I caught up relatively quickly. Granted I was on holiday, and had nothing to do for the first few days.

I dont get why people think blade/shards is worse. Tether literally closes area of the map, yanks your aim downwards, cancels your abilities and super...
---
Hell yeah. Less than 48 hours to go.
---
Good bye easily offended projecting person.
---
I kinda want one of those scribes to have kept an actual account of what happened when Calus was forced to leave the empire.
---
Thanks friendo
---
Ugh
---
JK, welcome to destiny! Nice to see a new Blueberry come into the game!
---
Right so are you 100% sure that if I dismantle it now I can reobtain it with shards?
---
Nah, he's all talk. He's got no real cabal left to do anything, that's why the Leviathan is basically a decrepit shell of it's former glory.
---
It's all a show - a facade. Not to get political, but Calus, in my mind, is not much different than a well known political figure in the US, albeit much more tolerable.
---
I loved the first game but it had its day, time for this to evolve further newer enemies not based off of ones we have seen
---
Destiny 2 bringing out that Big Wick Energy
---
?? ... disrepectful to the cat?
---
My wife was always the fire team leader when we played, I even tried having her load in without us being in a fire team because I thought that's why she wasn't getting Cayde in her game, maybe it was just a glitch that stuck idk. My theory was that you're not to get the treasure maps from cayde anymore so they just took it out from everyones game to keep people from starting a new game and going back to stockpile an item that's not really in game anymore.
---
Would you be interested in selling yours after seeing this post? Keep searching for one....
---
Yes.
---
Like, on Bungies list of priorities this one is pretty low fam.
---
if you dismantle it now, you get/ can reacquire it with Bright Dust. if you wait until after Shadowkeep launches, you can dismantle/reacquire Eververse items for Legendary Shards and possibly Glimmer
---
Hold up is d2 gonna be down Monday if so shit there goes all my grinding for redrix
---
“Part time cowboy, fully time dead”
---
oh dont worry, im switching to synthoceps/dunes   
---
i found out theyre more fun to play with
---
I support this. If you tweet to them then you will probably get a reply.
---
So if I dismantle it now i get bright dust and will be able to reacquire it afterwards with shards right?
---
Idc.

that is correct, note that Bright Dust will only be available via bounties from Strike/Gambit/Crucible bounties (unless i’ve missed something)
---
Yes but during forsaken's vidoc we heard it and the taken king DLC we heard it during the trailer
---
Ahhh yeah gotcha
---
People use the lfg feature of the D2 companion to make a party and play D1 occasionally.   Since it is a D2 app it shows your D2 characters.
---
Well it was FUCKEN ONE OF YUS! DESGOSTANG!
---
[deleted]
---
If all eververse items are changing from bright dust to shards, why not dismantle after shadow keep comes out and get a buck load of legendary shards?
---
Always been scheduled to start at 10:00AM Pacific Monday.
---
It hasn't happened yet?
---
Whether we wanted it or not, we’ve stepped into a trap in the ascendant realm.

RIP guardian 3
---
Not for me at least
---
I was at 12k dust after I got rid of everything but my lil Sparrow and 3 XP ghosts. Figured that was enough.
---
Every Titan ever created starts from a forgotten Mote of Light from Shaxx.
---
It was just knee deep at the Well.
---
nice
---
Wait til you find out about the blind well. :/
---
The only thing that is shared between platforms is the season pass.
---
Why even underline it?
---
I thought they were repeatable weekly bounties?
---
I so wish I had this.  A great group that sets aside time to game together..  you are lucky!  Enjoy for the loners!
---
Oho! Then come as close as you like!
---
(Gotta get that boss stomp somehow!)
---
You were supposed to bring balance to the Moon, not wake them!
---
If you have Militias Birthright or Orewings Maul with spike grenade, those would work. And the colony as your heavy. Or Fighting Lion with Play of the Game. You could also run Militias Birthright with Fighting Lion since it uses primary ammo.
---
I meant without the ship's defences. (Ig u could see it as, get past all the ships defence and get in to that one room with calus 1v1 or... 6v1) So it just leaves us with the unknown, as in we dont know what power he has on his own without his ship's help. I guess you could say he is as powerful as us in his own way. Its just that if u take the ship out of the picture, I dont know what his "being powerful in his own way" is, exactly
---
I liked the example of the guy earlier saying he ate something dense AF, but thats all we got apparently, unless someone found something.
---
But I'm guessing we have to wait for Bungie to say "this is what he can do" for me to understand OP's "calus could kill me on the spot for doing this or that" 
---
Anyway if he did want to do that he'd have to find something that kills our light, and that vex mind doesnt prove to be effective enough, see as how it took centuries for the vex to cut Saint-14's power
---
It would be funny though
---
Calus: u just killed my hive dude... ure gonna die for that...
---
300 years later
---
Calus: Guardian... remember that thing you did 300 years ago? I still didnt get over it... die bitch
---
Just so you know, the game is down for maintenance until Tuesday come tomorrow so do it today
---
Yeah, I just got back on D1 to reminisce and saw all the amazing shaders we had back then. My warlock was running ascendant plane (the black one with a green glow) and I realize the shaders we have now in D2 are, IMO, a downgrade. 
---
Plus those were shaders you earned as an actual reward from certain activities and you’d know right away what shader someone is wearing because most of them were distinct
---
Probably not
---
Good. I still have nightmares from the Nova Warp days. Oh God.. The horror...
---
Yes
---
Yep that's how I got the truimph for flawless solo
---
You're welcome, good luck and have fun with the wonders of pc destiny :)
---
Frick, do you know if the side quest like adventures and stuff available to do
---
I believe Outbreak is available to everyone too, but it’s been locked away by people being to underleveled to play it. New Light should change that.
---
Probably adventure and patrols that’s it
---
Nice.
---
Ok, thank you
---
Ayyyyyyyy
---
Somewhat? Titan armor, as a whole, is bulkier, so I don't know if that'll reflect.
---
I got my final reset for Dredgen the day before the new season started. Not so risky, except there was an accident near my home that knocked our internet down for the weekend, so I used my mobile hotspot. I live in Canada, this was before we had unlimited data plans.

Everytime shaxx levels up a new guardian is made. That’s why we call him daddy ShaXXX. The reason he wanted the vanguard to wait before going to the moon before they got rekt is because he wanted to protecc his babies. Now he organises the crucible because it’s a safe fight to the death like any good parent would do.
---
But some of us don't have 5 fingers.
---
*raises three fingered hand*
---
When I pve I usually use handcannon/sniper. But I don't do too much stuff outside of 2 Manning the nightfall with my best bud so we vary our loadouts to match the modifiers.  Honestly I just overall prefer snipers in most activities. Thorn and beloved or Tartara gaze is my go to.  Occasionally I'll use recluse and MT top but it's... It's the Staples button of loadouts.  Pvp I rotate though alot of loadouts.  Back in the day fighting loin never left my secondary slot. It's suck a good weapon (even without auto reloading)
---
His name isn't "Byf", his name is "My Name Is Byf"

No one cares, sorry

Whenever it says *Be experienced*:

Yea because don’t you think I would’ve used it by now? I have my reasons to not.

Amanda Holliday, I guess she is useless now.. she used to be the vendor for sparrows and ships in D1 but Eververse stole that from her :(
---
I like my ladies like I like my guardians... with a wet voice
---
Obvious, but the content additions dont look special, Moon, cool, gear, cool. But people are treating it like the game is actually changing, like mechanics, etc...
---
nuts
---
Well the things that are crazy is basically bungie doing what we wanted finally
---
Not in the sense of “wow! what are they doing ?”type of deal.
---
Going back to the moon!! Crota! Sweet sweet content
---
Yes sir, cries on 30 FPS ;(
---
Yep. OP i know haha
---
Habitable for billions of years... that was, until the vex time haunted it

Thanks :)

Maybe he just eating with one hand and trying not to afk with the other🤪
---
Titans are a crutch.
---
[removed]
---
Got everything cleaned up and ready for Shadowkeep. 
---
I’m sure many of you are going to blow me out of the water but I figured this would be interesting to see where everyone is at while we wait for Shadowkeep to launch.
---
Just wait till tuesday
---
:)
---
If I want to play on both Steam and PS4, do I need to buy it on both platforms? I'd assume yes, but want to double check.
---
Over penetrating rounds with true sight😏
---
You have to redownload it on steam
---
*discordant bell rings in the distance*
---
Hand to god it isn't that much of a difference, but unless you got somethin huge planned there aint much to get up to before reset haha
---
Just tried it without the disc and the game runs just fine. Thanks.
---
Best mlg host by far. And actually decent at fps
---
Yes it is.
---
*Makes De Niro agreeing face*
---
It's been a great mouse, i need to buy another as a backup in case they discontinue them for whatever reason.
---
The coupons have expired. Oh no, here comes Karen, aka the darkness.

This is so helpful -_-

Instead of answering a simple question you redirect me to a page full of unneeded information.

I've hit bladebarrages with a thunder crash and barely broken the shield.
---
Ahh, finally some clarification, thanks!
---
:/ destinythegame it is
---
So has anyone already figured out why we hear an evil ghost?
---
I prefer the latter  so I might go for destiny the game 
---
Thank you though
---
Loaded question is only good because of reservoir burst. You wont have that when auto reload is gone
---
OEM and bottom tree striker.... 
---
From one titan main to another...
---
***DISGUSTANG***
---
I don't think so? I haven't seen anything on the subreddits about it.
---
So I'm assuming you already bitched about being on earth, mercury, and Mars again? Or is just *this time* that bothers you because you have no personality other than being a contrarian just for the sake of being a contrarian?
---
Wow. I'm naming my first born No Life Kinali.
---
Holy shit. I forgot you could get armor. I downloaded this table and just farmed weapons ever since the thing came out! No biggie, it's just blown my mind that there is a whole armor set I haven't even touched yet. Cheers, Guardian.
---
I wouldn’t be worried about the roll, I would be worried about the who. Pretty sure God just taught you a lesson for using Jötunn.
---
Obviously i wasn’t referring to you in the first statement. you twat what is your problem.
---
It’s you’re btw
---
I’m getting hostile with people who are being smart asses like you.
---
And Wtf you asshole I’m  a fairly new player I didn’t  know of the damn destiny app.
---
I knew I'd get a comment about it 😂...I avoid crucible because I'm garbo at it, hence I have to use broken weapons to even stand a chance against the absolute tsunami or Luna's, NF's and god rolled pulses.
---
Well, patch notes exist ;D and a big patch is coming up so I'm recommending when notes come out you read if you want the numbers and changes to items.
---
Content wise, uhh, annual pass came along with 3 seasons, each adding new things. Forges, gambit prime, reckoning, menagerie, scourge of the past and crown of sorrow. Those are the new big activity contents that have come, the rest is seasonal mostly.
---
Anyone correct me if I'm wrong ;D
---
The meta always shifts. Enjoy it while it lasts instead of joining the honor circle jerk.
---
I still don't have that ghost shell. Lol.
---
&gt; You have to get a significant degree of luck to capitalise on its perks 
---
not really
---
Enjoy the game. Don't let anyone else's opinions get in the way of what you bought and what you want to enjoy.
---
Ignore all streamers, etc. and just make your own mind up about how you want to play the game. It's your experience.
---
Not the strongest counter but ok.
---
Not me. I'll be playing Borderlands.
---
yes it was
---
Beautiful damage
---
Dont infuse gear until max level.  You'll just be wasting resources, and higher stuff will drop anyways.
---
 Not sure sure you appreciate how vast Valve/Steam is? They can handle the load, being their core business after all
---
Got mine just today as well. Gg’s!
---
People were mostly complaining about Mercy instant double-rez. But I don't think any other healers were playable at the time though, Winston/DVa just blocks so many healing abilities. Mercy needed a nerf, but it would've still been Mercy in dive meta.
---
Nah, she had Eleusinia built as her throne world in preparation for Shaxx.
---
Followed by people arguing about who didn't cross shoot.  Every. Damn. Time.
---
It's a different kind of sub...
---
You're not suppose to downvote to disagree, but people use karma to state their own opinion. Sucks but that's what usually happens.
---
Extinguished modifier that the one where it kicks the team to orbit right?
---
In a mere 35 hours, we assault the moon's surface and finally take back what is ours from the scourge of this universe, the Hive! Eyes up Guardians and keep your trigger fingers ready!
---
Cringe.
---
I was thinking the exact same thing!! (That's actually why I looked up the original tweet to see if OP wrote it or not, like "That's way too accurate to be a bot lol")
---
The only thing that would've made it better is if they added "You Exo prat."
---
It's a meme, and also the OP did admit to writing it.
---
This so much. It helps that I'm not a dead beat. When she talks to her friends and learns that they're getting cheated on or worse, makes her snap back into reality. She then hugs me and loves me for always being 10 feet from her when I'm not at work. I'm Either in the kitchen eating or on the couch with a controller in my hands. Then she nags the very next day. Rinse and repeat.

Absolutely I’d either be a arc strider or blade dancer if they are still around
---
It makes perfect sense, the fact that you know it's bashing battlenet proves that.
---
You pretty much know it all. However. PvP will make you want to punch a hole through a wall. If you got time for it then great. If not, then you can kiss having a good PvP afternoon session goodbye. This game is really fun. Gunplay is amazing. Guns are great. Lore is there if you are into that. Grind isn't horrible. Make friends early and join a like-minded clan.  There are some parts of the game that are virtually impossible to accomplish alone.
---
Such fun killing one person with a blade barrage only to get blade barraged yourself two seconds later
---
prob gona get mix or bad reviews cuz of warframe fan bois and the TL;DR ppl (and/or from thos how don’t get the season pass)
---
The most basic but the most important tip...
---
Armors have 3 main stats you want to learn to manage as soons as possible. They have mobility, resistance and regeneration.
---
You need to learn to focus on resistance and regeneration stats. Don't bother with the extra armor stats you'll see under them, you'll focus on that later. The most important is to be strong ( resistence = extra health ) and healthy ( regeneration = you start to regen quicker after having taken damage ).
---
It's really important you get that...
---
Okay but you’re also annoying other hunters, warlocks and titans who can actually use a skilled loadout
---
the only time Anthem has a blip of players
---
You have to buy exotic ships back with bright dust though right?
---
Reacquiring won’t cost bright dust?
---
Still an accurate representation of my hunter during the Forsaken/Dredgen days.
---
Yep, most of times it work w 1 :) Probly some bug or something
---
😂 😂
---
Being honest sounds nice but most lfg groups I find myself in will go ballistic with one wipe, saying “that was me” will shift their anger towards you, it has happened enough to me where I strictly stay quiet. The only time I’ll speak up is if the group is shill and is willing to teach.
---
I'll answer your question if you answer mine. Are you a woman?
---
Traveler, ghost, hunter, guardian, tricorn
---
The singles are 0.99 yet the bundles are 140-350 like why wouldn’t they just buy the singles on their own. 
---
Also if it’s not trolling I’d put money on that OP probs runs the service or knows the person who runs the service. A lot of low budget online sales services do this as a marketing tool so wouldn’t be surprised in the slightest.
---
Part time cowboy, full time dead.
---
Cayde's ship can't be pulled from collections even if you bought it in eververse. If you're talking about regular exotic ships, after shadowkeep drops you'll be able to pull them from collections for glimmer and legendary shards.
---
ZeroTwo didn’t have her Darling with her it seems.
---
I’ll answer that if you can tell me what difference it makes
---
I never knew i needed this.  
---
I love this.
---
Ok I keep seeing mixed responses about whether reacquiring will cost bright dust so I’m going to hold off on some stuff.
---
But then they all move to Warframe instead
---
Poor Cayde. I thought what they did was perfect though. Keep the people safe but send a reckoning towards whoever killed Cayde in the shape of a fire team composed of Guardians. The people needed to be safe. And they were. But someone had to pay and they did.
---
hotel: trivago
---
and they wonder why they have never finished a raid and have to LFG for a squad. Hats off to you for helping the"new guy".
---
Shadowkeep is designed to be playable seperate, but yes that would be the order you play things, especially since Shadowkeep has a bunch of returning enemies that you fight in the other campaigns.
---
You can play it in Chronological order or you can skip around a bit. Pay attention to the symbol in the upper right hand corner of the mission as it will tell you which DLC mission you are about to do.
---
Do you by any chance live in a timezone like GMT +8 ок anything like that?
---
You need to buy the DLC per platform as I understand it.
---
I’m in Australia 😤 turns out downtime is 2am for us (aest)
---
This....is surprisingly accurate! I'd play that mission and maybe even do the heroic mission a few times. I just wanna hear Zavala say something about light bulb coupons. That would make my day 😂
---
Yeah it’s quite simple to navigate.
---
You got instant health and regeneration whenever you doged. Now it only gives regeneration I think

You mean a 10 round burst shotgun isn’t normal?

It's stickied at the top of the subreddit mate, lol.

If you do that imagine the character you're deleting is you're character from Destiny 1 and it has history then you lose all of that history because you wanted to change something about one of your characters.
---
The fact you only have to hold reload
---
Yeah 750 is the floor and you cant go lower than that
---
Yes. 750 is the new floor so nothing going to be lower than it.

Oh ok thanks for the info this helps a lot I thought I was just going to be able to run through the game with op stuff
---
as f2p, do we still get the same level caps as people with Shadowkeep?
---
This is the one strike I hated doing most and wont miss it a bit.
---
I don’t run the old strikes now. Only reasons I did them is for the SOH armor and the powerful engram.I find them boring I hated the grind for Oxygen rather play pvp then run strikes.

Everyone will also be 50 forever when shadowkeep drops, not just existing characters

The new game: Density
---
From my understanding SK Is included in the 79 gig download and will be activated once it’s launched. The DLC that’s showing not installed will be ticked once launched.

I read this info in another thread and can’t confirm if it’s 100 accurate tho
---
It is indeed, from 9.45 am PDT!

I'll tell you tomorrow.
---
Whenever you buy a game it's with expendable money. Name any other hobby where you can get 100's if not 1000's of hours of entertainment out of so little investment. The f2p portion is nothing more than a tutorial and catch up mechanic. Everything from forsaken on still has to be purchased. My point was not defending anything. My point was juveniles like you ruin an entire review system because you as a "consumer " bought something at a premium and are now upset years down the road because it's given away for less than what you paid for it.
---
If you enjoyed Titan I'd say go with it again. Even PvE should be benefiting from them now though mainly with bubble (ward of dawn - top tree sentinel) which isn't aggressive but strikers have always been good in PvP. But after I'd say warlock since getting used to the jumps isn't as weird, and their supers IMO just feel more fun to use. Hunters aren't bad I just don't have much fun using mine outside of being a tether in pve.
---
Have you bought Shadowkeep on PC and Forsaken?
---
So I guess wait and see?
---
why is that?  after tomorrow you cant play on [battle.net](https://battle.net)

Play on both if you can and have a need. Continue to use the controller if that’s your comfort in order to enjoy the content. Plan to mix in KB/M routinely to get accustomed to it. Use PVE as training when/where possible.

However, as a life-long console player lacking any KB/M experience, it is excruciating difficult to jump back on console after a few sessions on PC. In the end the decision boils down to enjoying the game.

this is a thought i wanted to hear. is it really significant to the point that you cant keep up with a controller?
---
this is what i heard. im leaning this way
---
Thanks very much!
---
Thank you for your quick respond guys, I just discover Reddit very cool site/app. I gonna do what gundog say do the initial with all the classes :)
---
Actual gods - 5 (6 if you count Ghaul although that was technically the traveler)
---
Machine gods - 3
---
Self proclaimed gods - 1 (again 2 if you counted Ghaul although he wasn’t technically a god, more of a synthetic demigod)
---
For free, the word your looking for is for free, not less...free...also, tutorial my ass. That "tutorial" was more than $100. Btw asking to name any other hobby is really stupid when were talking about games, I can name other games, sure but why the hell are you asking me for other hobbies.
---
Yep. They’ve said that they (Bungo) are changing how you start the game— even been mention of going back to the Cosmodrome and start the game almost how Destiny 1 started.
---
My hope is that they somehow tie the two games together and have spruced up the start of the game instead of just “hey you’re here... go kill this guy”
---
Destiny wasn't meant to run 30 fps, as long as you have a rig that runs destiny 60 fps or higher your gonna really enjoy it, just please, make sure all your drivers are up to date
---
at least his ears will be warm.
---
It was actually pretty nice. Especially for a first. Keep up the good work bud
---
I'd say about 20% is a good area, wormhusk can help if you fall behind in a gunfight but it's not going to win it for you. Overall (on paper that is) wormhusk is in a good spot
---
6pm usual unlock time on steam.
---
thank you for the thought out reply. i don't have many friends that i play with regularly on console but enough that i could definitely find someone to do something with me if i needed. however isn't the LFG on PC supposed to be far superior to consoles, especially xbox like i play?
---
If those keys are bought with stolen info, bungie takes a loss, not G2A. Now that bungie is handling this it's more important now to support them directly.
---
Don't bother, that dude clearly will never understand.
---
Patch notes got leaked:
---
Shoulder charge does 300% more damage. 
---
Hunter and Warlock melee damage has been reduced to combat this change  
---
Striker titan also last until it dies
---
That slide in snipe at the beginning has me jealous tho ngl xD
---
Sweet. Thank you very much.
---
I'm not sure I fully understand your question but I believe this will help 
---
There are 3 classes in Destiny 2: Titan, Hunter and Warlock. The base version of Destiny 2 will allow you to obtain 3 sub-classes per class and the choice between two variations of each sub-class. Forsaken adds one additional variation of each sub-class – increasing the sub-class variations from 6 per class to 9 per class.

---
Excellent question I am on ps4 so ours should just update not sure what version your on...
---
Yea it’ll run, low settings and likely 720p but it’ll run
---
So about an hour. Alright. Someone mind checking back and telling me then?
---
God dammit Caboose.

---
I’m at work so don’t have the time to type out all the corrections, but Paul Tassi’s article spelled things out pretty clearly.
---
Well i suppose depending on how good you depends on how well you keep up, but even someone who is real good with a controller and can do well would still be putting themselves at a disadvantage as it isn't a level playing field.
---
After you get your Light back, you’re able to play with friends
---
Yeah I understand that. I just wish they could stop complaining.
---
The one thing I think you should do is get rid of the sword. When it’s time for DPS on the primeval that will really kill your teams output.
---
&gt; That comment was probably me XD
---
Seeing that the first reveal was over a month ago, probably not :P
---
Datto actually has a video showing it [in (in-dev) Shadowkeep PvP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_c2WNCQPOw), including thoughts of its placement in the meta.
---
YES
---
OG GHOST
---
I AM SO TIRED OF FANCY GHOSTS
---
I bought the deluxe edition, mostly for the hive themed ghost tbh....
---
Fear the Death Roomba
---
oh i get that it was just the buddy at the end that made it seem rude to me its all good though no need to worry.
---
Let it be, I've been a Titan main since Day 1 D1 and I've learnt to get over it - just have your fun in peace and let them whine
---
Forsaken?
---
I have a feeling that a large part of the delay was to avoid releasing within a few days of Borderlands 3.
---
Ratlings already ate those
---
oh... I just saw dattos vid (published 2 days ago) on YouTube and dropped a comment of similar nature... (which turns out is the same video linked above).  The thing is, in the video, he didnt discuss specific rolls on Luckypants that would take the build to the next level such as, in my case, Enhanced HandCannon Dexterity
---
Min download space requirement 68gb
---
Spooksters
---
Because they know how to read, also notice how the post was taken down. You like looking like an idiot don't you?  I'm finished dealing with you, I can only embarass you so much.
---
Shoulder charge time?
---
Zavala must be jealous 😀
---
Yeah but im just so tired seeing titan haters everywhere. I wish there was a less toxic destiny community
---
Doesn't release until reset tomorrow, but a lot of people seem to think it'll release at midnight. The sub is gonna be filled with "why can't I play" posts and it'll be great
---
He did actually mention quickdraw (which is what lucky pants do) as one of the two (outside of competitive) viable builds in that video. :P
---
Bungalow*
---
Why isn't "get a job" on this list?
---
It does though, have fun being an idiot, I'm finished dealing with children.
---
Got a lab report due Wednesday but I may or may not have scheduled my classes so I have nothing on Tuesday..
---
Is that the actual download size or just the recommended?
---
Good thing no one needs your money.
---
yeah but not with the perk EHcD
---
Its planed at the local reset time.... maybe main takes more time and usually the login is difficult at the beginning because of lot of traffics, and because they still work on some things
---
Edit: what i heard
---
I m totally hyped for tomorrow when shadowkeep gets released😍 
---
Ghost: We've woken the hive
---
My thoughts exactly. There was no friendship to begin with.
---
TIL that fleshing out established story elements = stagnating.
---
My friend said it’s 95 total for Xbox so only 6gigs since we already have 89 downloaded but apparently for some reason on PS4 the total is 165 gigs
---
 Outstanding pandering, shitty pizza, Papa John's
---
I Agree, but most won't agree because it's kinda what reddit is for.
---
Sons of the Emperor (Calus)
---
well is the current planned end of maintanance today or tomorrow?
---
AVE OMNISSIAH
---
Yea, but that isn't "build defining" on it's own. It's pretty much the logical step to use perks fitting the specific build. Even more so seeing that you use 2x handcannon and there isn't any reason to use different perks in the first place.
---
Armor 2.0 will also allow you to pick those perks for your exotic once you have them unlocked, so everyone can roll with those perks.
---
Is there a penance for using godrolled Erentil too?
---
Thank you. I like the emblem.
---
Yep. Now my hunger for Borderlands has been sated after these 3 weeks. Now I can play Shadowkeep and Borderlands back to back.
---
That cloak tho
---
Existing is for nerds
---
Titan gear in D2 is so bad I switched to warlock.
---
Bois, its spooky season.
---
You're part of this problem you realise that right
---
Daily reset on Tuesday I believe
---
You still have 20 minutes
---
When's the live action movie coming out using this script wtf
---
Oct 1st
---
Good to hear, enjoy it!
---
For est it says 1pm for me so they’ll be down for 24 hours
---
Oh thank god, I thought it was 68 gigs for shadowkeep. I’ll definitely be able to play tomorrow 😄
---
What the funny thing is this post was after mine so apparently I’m the only person that ran into the scum of this sub.
---
Thanks for ruining the first launch for me
---
Play the campaigns, immerse yourself a bit in the characters and the story, think about the rest later
---
You're right it doesn't. Great work! Now make more Cayde-6 Stuff :)
---
Use arc boi for more tears.
---
Using the wish wall has no effect on your RNG for the 1K Voices.
---
Back when tripmines attached and grenades 1shot miss that
---
We’ll call it a draw
---
Yep purchase shadowkeep reset Xbox it will be in the updates section on Xbox dashboard.
---
That was my reaction
---
We Warcraft now bois
---
This happened the other day ... https://youtu.be/sOpMrVnjYeY
---
Lol already purchased and downloaded it. About to download this update soon, that's awesome thx!
---
Shadowkeep has not launched yet lmao
---
Thanks, I do love my hunter for sure! They rock in crucible and tether is great! Unfortunately, I don’t  have blade barrage unlocked.
---
Dunno why your's isn't working...I am currently having a beer with eris morn after beating Shadowkeep, 30 mins! A new record! Have you tried turning it off for 24 hours and trying again?
---
Half-time Cowboy Full-time dead
---
Base game + Curse of Osiris, Warmind, and lots of Y2 activities such as Gambit, Black Armory Forges, Gambit Prime, Reckoning, and Menagerie + TONS more will all be free.  
---
Only Forsaken, other Annual Pass content such as Exotic Quests and Shadowkeep/Season 8 will cost you money.
---
Base game, yes, forsaken, no.
---
Can we get a spoiler tag? /s
---
True Hellfire (HELL) is recruiting!!! Let’s raid the moon!
---
Bruh
---
I didn’t really mean using the wall as more of just riven and so on vs. doing the entire raid
---
I’m hoping that they don’t, but expecting them to. Either way though, I’m going to grind so hard for that new scoped hand cannon.
---
No, not technically. It will include shadowkeep and season of the undying, but the base game with the first 3 dlcs are going to be free to play. So no, but technically yes.
---
The game has a character level and power level(gear level) relative to each character. Normally you would level up as in any other rpg to a cap of 50 and progress your power level up to the current cap of 750. After that, its about getting exotic weapons and armor. Guns also drop with perks that are rolled randomly each drop. More dedicated players tend to farm drops in hopes of a "god roll" perfect perk combination to maximize their potential in pvp and pve. As I understand from the TWAB posts, with the release of shadowkeep, not only will the power level be raising to a soft cap of 960, every player will be recieving a seasonal artifact as well. As you play this artifact will level up, granting you new seasonal perks and increasing your power level past soft cap represented as " PL 960(+x)". X being the power gained beyond soft cap. So there is a sort of continued power creep after cap but it's seasonal. So next season, your artifact will be replaced with a new one to level up past soft cap again complete with new seasonal perks.
---
you're out of luck, sorry
---
I’m sorry did that offend you? Enjoy your console
---
Canadians like weird shit?
---
The seasons will be like the seasons we had his year; Season of the forge, Season and the Drifter and Season of opulence, they are just little dlcs with some new activities and quests for you to do, I think its worth it overall, but I can understand if it isnt all that appealing to some people that plan on coming to destiny
---
Same, but from dominoes cause fuck papa J
---
There is plenty of build variety. For each character I usually have 2-3 different sets of armor for different roles. Shadowkeep is updating Armor so there will be increased diversity going forward.
---
Only the 100th post too
---
You need a life.
---
Free to play game is the top seller of the day hahahaaaaa
---
100% Agree. No game has ever had perfectly balanced PVP. I understand that in full.
---
What would you say about build variety? I understand it cant compete with POE but just curious. I still have yet to receive any answer on build variety.
---
Oh well, no you'd have the same chance at getting if you skipped straight to Riven as you would if you did a full run. Its honestly quicker to do Riven CPs
---
The base game and first two dlc are becoming a free to play called new light.  Forsaken purchase is required for the forsaken content, and the forsaken annual pass is included with the purchase of that, if I'm not mistaken.
---
Priorities
---
More like ready to go outside... for a few hours at least
---
How, what if I wanted to see the cutscene with the music for the first time together
---
Sorry this took me a bit to get back 
---
Yes, what I’m saying is, telling your best friend they’re throwing and holding the team back is a lot harder than telling a “teammate” that has been tried and tested in high tier activities that they need to shape up and do better, it’s easier to not take criticism personally if your relationship to your team is less personal
---
It’s kinda like the difference between calling a foul on someone in a neighborhood game of flag football, verses a flag thrown in an NFL game, sure things may get heated either way, but it’s not going to feel al personal in a “team” situation vs a “friend group” situation 
---
Not to mention the bias that can come from having one or two friend groups mixed in with other guys, cliques form FAST, and it can turn into an US vs THEM situation, 
---
And as far as brute forcing it
---
Last wish day 1: the first team to beat vault did not understand the mechanic and just randomly cleansed plates until they beat it 
---
Scourge of the past day 1 : many teams ignored phase synergy and just whispered the boss across 4 phases until they killed it lol
---
Edit: as a counter example (I could be wrong but I think this was Gothalion) was CONVINCED that the vault solution had something to do with “the food chain” and which animals were present in the symbols, 
---
In hindsight I’m sure he would find the notion utterly ridiculous, but when enemies are hard your brain starts trying to make the puzzle hard too, and you can stuck on blatantly ridiculous theories that lead nowhere 
---
If I put money on it I’d say that in a raid situation Bungie is never going to throw a puzzle at you that requires knowledge outside of knowledge provided by the puzzle itself, 
---
The way symbols correspond in vault is entirely contained in the puzzle there is no need for knowledge outside of what is contained there 
---
For example day 1 scourge my team overthought the shit out phase 1 and how the synergies work, until we finally just came to the conclusion that :
---
They have no significance outside of the fact that you can’t punch two different synergies
---
I’ve actually come to love my warlock as well! I feel they have more survivability and can cater to a fire team much more efficiently, plus space magic!
---
Holy fucking shit. Okay, now I feel like a loser.
---
Looks like a lot of different information, guess will see tomorrow for sure.
---
At the same time as the release of the new expansion I believe, which is in just under 24 hours.
---
Wow, everyone thought that cube world died 6 years ago and now it is freakin topseller on steam.
---
Dude, I'd buy silver for this
---
Just pick up on your warlock dude. If you restart, your light level would just be 750 to start with
---
Well, that’s not quite what I was looking for. Was just curious on which class would be more viable at the start. I’m going to level all of my characters regardless. 
---
You were not forced to read or reply. The D2 community has always been extremely helpful and it’s unfortunate that people would take a simple question,which reddit is for, and start trolling. 
---
All good, still excited for Shadowkeep!!!
---
I noticed for some people that it no longer said cross save enabled but I also was in discord when we all did it. I’m just hoping all my friends actually did it. 
---
Jokingly I think of that paul walker meme that says:
---
“goodnight see ya tomorrow”
---
*road splits
---
“last seen online 4 years ago”
---
Edit: I posted it
---
Sorry I read the article wrong, I apologise.
---
The bruh moment was you browsing Reddit at this time
---
I wasn't saying you in particular. I eas just making a generalized statement. When people go turbo negative like that, it is infuriating. Regardless, I don't see why what I said was so assholey? It's just facts man, if people consistently play bad, avoid comp vecause you ruin it for the rest of us
---
I feel like titan will be better with the weapons of light buff, but hunter isnt changing overall, and they are good for damaging bosses if you have celestial. Titan is a safer option imo
---
They gave warning in multiple spots to move before the shut down. It is gone, sadly.
---
This is frigging awesome - the spade looks so shiny. Nice work!
---
What
---
I didn't migrate in time lol. Pretty sure i'm completely fucked. IDK if they'll still have server info to allow migration or whatever after.
---
I keep losing the argument with myself though
---
It’s patch number 2.6.0.1, yes.
---
No because you set the pc account as your "main account" you'll have to unlink it but you wont be able to link an account for 90 days!!
---
Lol
---
Only downside is that you have twice as much work to do
---
*happy Shaxx noises*
---
Farnese is that you ?
---
Again, busy with real life, was not paying attention to D2 news outside of the basics. It's fine though - I don't care that I can't transfer right now. I just thought I'd lost everything by not transferring before, but now I've realized that's not the case, so it's fine.
---
I did play on bnet though, so should i just activate the cross save, or wait til transfer to steam? Sorry, just trying to make sure i do everything correctly and don’t have to re buy any/everything
---
You can start and 100% Untitled Goose Game before tomorrow. Go be a bigger asshole than an OEM titan.
---
77. Watch JoJo
---
but 1.4 is shadowkeep ?
---
Probably the second, considering there's got to be some sort of standard on this kind of signalling.
---
Novote for muffins
---
Ha. That's enough downside for me. Thanks!  I didn't want a sweet cape anyway.
---
Good shit! Now its preloading
---
It is in Australia the 2nd October possibly set on wrong time zone.
---
Loading screen’s haunted.
---
PC MOVE: Transfer ALL Data and licenses from bnet to steam 
---
CROSS SAVE: make a PC/console account playable on other platforms
---
They have NOTHING TO DO with each other 
---
If you want to do PS4-&gt;PC  cross
---
If you want battle -&gt; steam -&gt; pc move 
---
If you want to „save“ your bnet account but play with your PS4 account you activate both and chose your PS4 as active 
---
That way if you ever deactivate cross save you still have your bnet account on steam
---
Lmao
---
I think there is some small update on its way.
---
You don't have to wait, I have word that Forsaken well be sold separately, so preorder the 35$ version now for the bonuses, and the 15-25$ version of Forsaken on the 1st.
---
Poops
---
I would say unlimited Exotics should be a game mode but I know this is exactly what a Titan would do every game.
---
&gt;Then you do not know what you face. The Darkblade is formidable. And left unchecked, a worthy successor to lead the Hive.
---
-Eris Morn
---
Oh man. Untitled good game with bottom tree striker
---
This is why Crucible is the single most unbalanced PvP mode in the whole history of games
---
HOT!
---
Tbh I won’t miss it much.
---
It'll definitely keep you busy for a few days, grind aside
---
thanks, they also just posted about it on twitter. I was worried about losing stuff since I hadn't already switched
---

---
The worst part of all this, is grinding my way into the 1000+ glory range as an average solo player and when you start having good games and winning getting dos'd by the pussies that can't win in comp otherwise.  I gave up after multiple sessions of getting magically disconnected from the game immediately after winning the first match of a game.  Finally just gave up and stopped playing all together.  Maybe now with shadowkeep I'll try again since there are glory minimum ranks and also play on a VPN when I do comp, or maybe not at all if there's no real reason to do comp with pinacle weapon being nerfed and no new ones being introduced.
---
LOVE IT
---
See you on the Moon!
---
JoJo is the only thing keeping me alive until Shadowkeep.
---
Completing all of the free stuff is probably a couple hundred hours
---
Thanks for the information after I beat the free stuff how much is it for the pass or do I just buy a different version
---
LOL I paid hard earned bright dust for Micro Mini.
---
I'm happy to drop silver on some good stuff though.
---
Never knew so many people hate fusion users 😢
---
I need a shotgun called Horrible Goose in Shadowkeep.
---
Those are about to be free starting tomorrow, so you are in luck (black armory and menagerie)
---

This is on Xbox, when you start a game you always see a splash screen (image before the game starts)
---
Thanks! I am, but still havn't touched PC and wanna re-experience all of it from scratch, with better visuals lol.
---
And by the time I'm done the new light stuff, will probably be able to pick up a good forsaken discount (aince i have to friggin repurchase-.-) and maybe a shadowkeep discount.
---
Ready to bust some ghosts.

Hey, at least they don't explode into half a dozen Nova Bombs and chase you halfway back through the map anymore.

Music sounds amazing when you load it up.
---
Humperdoo from Preacher
---
You can't do it until they launch tomorrow but no, it shouldn't be too late.
---
Fair enough, it's how me and a friend got the Shattered Throne thing done for the Majestic armour so
---
Is this an unemployment joke? Who is online and available at 12pm EST...
---
Bruh those were some DARK DAYS!
---
Even worse was popping a titan bubble and then having them just bounce around and kill you as soon as the bubble dropped. There was that one strike i used to basically just run back to the beginning after each shrieker
---
I hope someone can make a wallpaper from this splash screen
---
The code redemption page is down till Shadowkeep drops. Save this page for later, lads.

Cheers OP, it looks like one of the nicer emblems Bungo has made.

Well I’m a big idiot lol. Thank you!

whats your "internet speed" from your isp? if its persay 100 Mbps then your download on steam, which is in MB, is 10 MB. they are different and the one your isp shows is to make you think you have more. look it up thats your normal speed.
---
Obvious question; have you checked in steam settings to see if there is a download limit enabled? I sometimes do this so other people on the WiFi can still use the internet and sometimes forget to change it to unlimited
---
Yep. It's been a persistent issue for two years for me and I've just learned to live with it. Interestingly enough, my speed does increase slightly if I turn ON the download cap at 25mb/s

So on Saturday I started grinding for breakneck. I hadn’t played Destiny since around Halloween. Was around 30 games in when I decided to go to bed on Sunday. 
---
I watched a guy have 15 motes and the primeval ready to be spawned and he continued to attack enemies and run around. I was absolutely furious lol. 
---
Off topic question...will I still be able to finish that quest after this ShadowKeep update?
---
Hahaha aaah good times

"so *sniff*,all those years on Mars killing demons and now what,they were on the Moon?Well,i spent years erasing the wrong creatures from a Planet,this Will Be Easy"

Depends. I’ll look at some spoilers depending on what it is. I basically avoided reddit and Facebook until I could go see endgame. I’ll look at some things game related if I want to see how to get something in game and there is a spoiler involved.
---
I wan't this expansion so badly, but tapped out after early Christmas shopping D:

I hope my family loves me enough to get it for me for Christmas (preferably very very early)

Is this real I want it
---
*tips hat*
---
Can’t you just wear the eververse ornaments?
---
Indeed.
---
Sadly no
---
I love this community.
---
I would so use it

he said that he didnt mind. we saved his life anyway on Nessus so he owed it to us (his words, not mine)

Happy cake day!

on my steam i have the same, if i go to manage downloads it says scheduled for 23 34. literally a few mins time, i'm hoping this is the preload, maybe check under manage downloads and see if you have the same?
---
Thank you very much.
---
F
---
Why u uninstalling?
---
I would take time off to be able to play but it sounds like servers won’t be up until 10am PDT which is around 1pm EST iirc. I’m excited to see the first expansion sans activision and see if their vision for what the game should have been has been realized.
---
Wait, thats illegal
---
Your not using bottom tree striker, are you actually ready?
---
Damn...he shoulder thicc
---
But only for those who bought the expansion wasn't it, what about the free new light version ?
---
Raids will never have matchmaking. Too much coordination needed compared to a strike or nightfall.
---
Thanks for the info
---
it comes out tomorrow
---
Google Destiny New Light....why are so many incapable people here?
---
We should but we're stubbornly attached to our clan name :P
---
So i will get it tomorrow??
---
Im stealing this for my wallpaper right now.
---
So am I sol if I cant transfer my stuff from blizzard because the bungie site is down?
---
Thats what i did for ps, and for my rainmeter
---
Base game, warmind and curse of Osiris are free to play. You will need to buy forsaken still, but if you do, the annual pass for it will be free. You will also need to buy anything starting at shadowkeep and whatever comes after.
---
I pre ordered shadowkeep from them and they gave me a used code, now I'm waiting on the support thing. Don't preorder anything with them
---
Same here, I am also kinda hoping for some voice acting for the players guardian like what they did in Destiny 1 and shadowkeep. I just think it adds an extra layer of story building that can bring extra meaning into the game.
---
I needed something to replace my cyberpunk 2077 one.
---
This needs to be on the front page yesterday
---
Hey you might get lucky, and a well to do Guardian could privately message you and gift a code to you. 
---
I've seen stuff like that happen. Who knows.
---
Hunter, hunter, tricorn*
---
Will Forsaken’s gameplay changes (I’ve heard it gave D2 an overhaul) apply to pre-Forsaken content as well? I’m curious if those changes are permanent / retroactive.
---
you are correct
---
Google.com
---
I wish I had played enough to have all that bright dust
---
Xbox shows a splash screen apparently.
---
yes, everyone will, no matter what server or place in the world you are
---
It's like 50 in aus bux, feels bad
---
That will be pretty sweet to get some of my older exotics up to 750.
---
I can dream.
---
They probably can't transfer ever account at once. It will take time. Mine shows all my B.net stuff has moved over but I'm sure it will take time for everyone to see it
---
Real sad gamer hours.
---
Similar thing happened in batman arkham knight where the joker (he was dead and was like a nightmare) followed batman around taunting him and stuff. It would be kinda cool for cayde to do that
---
That titan hit his head one too many times
---
Nah man, Moon's haunted. Gotta look on the dark side
---
Could even be how we obtain catalyst for Ace....
---
im happy i finally get to use my geomags and not get bitched at for not using well
---
I see,another warlock of culture with red circuited geomags
---
No i have the Game for 1 1/2 year now but its Not FAIR like most of the Users here are saying if i buy a Game for a Price and a few months Later the Game is free and i dont get anything for it. thats fvcking disgusting. At least they should give Users who transfer their Accounts from bungie the new dlc. That would be fair.
