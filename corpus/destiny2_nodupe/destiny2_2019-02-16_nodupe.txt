I'd argue that it is a 'game' issue due to one little word there in your response: "requirement." At its core, it's the game developers themselves that set the requirements that players have to meet, be it of skill or time entry, and I'd argue that better game design favors the former. There is nothing stopping Bungie from, for instance, making Shattered Throne a permanent thing so that someone who, for the sake of example, is too busy every 3rd week to actually get to the dreaming city, can get Izanagi's. The people playing Destiny are Bungie's paying customers, and I'd argue there's more sense in allowing your customers to get to content if they meet that bar of skill, and not of time investment. Bungie are the ones saying you need to 'sacrifice specific aspects' of your life if you for instance wanted to get Redrix due to the godawful reset in ONE season requirement. Why can't they just make it 5 resets so you could theoretically get it without cutting into your time? You'd still need a similar level of skill for other segments of the quest, and playing a lot in one season doesn't necessitate skill. Life is more important than the game, sure, but as a company providing us with a game, shouldn't they keep that in mind as well when designing aspects of the game that lean more towards time investment than proof of skill?

Who cares about streamers?  They are what is wrong with video games anymore

I'm going to ha e to dust off my slideshot/rampage Dust Rock Blues and give it a concerted effort.
---
That's dumb, why does the TV support HDR10 if it's gonna break when HDR happens?
---
Four eyes

Git gud 
---
Does that make Tracer mains with shitty pings time gods?
---
I would imagine so long as you have enough confectionary hearts, you should be able to buy a masterworked Vow bow whenever you want until Tuesday. You could of course just get it from collections as well. 
---
I thought it was big Chungs 
---
take the upvote sir
---
Out of curiosity, did you make the base mesh of the corridor yourself from scratch? Looks really neat!
---
I can't get above 1000... it's so sad. 
---
Ok 
---
the same goes for most online games that are older than a year tho, warframe, swtor, wow, overwatch... (if they get anything regarding content at all, i mean its a pvp focused game, there isnt much to achieve anyway)
---
You could just buy it from Benedict. I’m not sure what he has now but it’s showed up there before 
---
can you help me get it ? , I really wanna get the gun and I reached around 1000ish in the last season but did't make it to the end , now I'm around 680 and I really wanna play with someone experienced cuz it is just painful playing with randos
---
Honestly the grenade meta is better then normal shotgun apes. More skill involved since grenades force most encounters into mid-long range as opposed to fist bump distance. Considering the shotgun meta is one of the most controversial, can't really be suprised when we get a limited event that specifically counters it.
---
This is what I was referring to yes. 
---
Thanks for the quick response pops. If you only you were on console. I'm currently searching for a person with 2 consoles to test this out 
---
Seeing all the posts of people who hated pvp but learned to get better, or love it now proves your point. If you are on PC I can help you with last wish(I'm a Sherpa) otherwise r/DestinySherpa should be useful and helpful for you!
---
Bur then again, benedict hasn't sold it in at least 9 weeks. So thats kinda unfortunate.. 
---
That's in the realm of game balance though, ads shouldn't keep perfect fov. 
---
Truly, you have been blessed by the RNG gods
---
The moon map back in D1 for instance 
---
Damn yeah I have no experience doing this on console so you might have to experiment a bit
---
So when do you start your job at Bungie?
---
Dreaming City. 
---
I have no experience doing this on console, you’ll have to experiment a bit
---
*Laughs in OEM oncoming nerfs*
---
most teams will kick people with no mic. minimal communication is doable but just let them know you don’t like speaking much. communication is key
---
Heart of inmost light! Hahahahahaa
---
The matchmaking has been pretty spot on for me this time.
---

---
I've played 22 matches, won 11, and got all the hearts I need to buy everything.
---
Perfect event in my mind.
---
One weird thing is a rando I matched with and I stomped another team 3 games (games, not rounds) in a row before they quit because apparently it just puts all 4 people back into the same teams no matter how badly one team does.
---
https://i.imgur.com/haWQqOr.jpg
---
It’ll be hard to run with most groups if you can’t communicate in some way but technically you can do it. I’ve ran with groups who have nearly kicked a guy who wasn’t talking. He spoke up in time to not get removed. Most raid encounters are heavily dependent on teamwork and communication. A lot of raid encounters rely on call outs of some kind, so if you can’t call out, it may be an issue. 
---
Thanks, never heard that. Always call it pve, learn something every day 
---
I'd love to live in your fantasy world where it's possible to stay that far away from the enemy team and not be a complete non-factor throughout the match. To act like teams don't run around like a pack of wolves with shotguns and Luna's and would allow you to sit back is silly.
---
Most of those sites are just regurgitating reddit threads. Now when i want up-to-the date and accurate i append "reddit" to the google search (or just search in reddit is fun app).
---
If I'm using google, I modify the search parameters to most recent by day, week then month (expanding as i need to if no results are relevant) by selecting the "Tools" option.
---
I have a mug with this on it 
---
It's random from what I know 
---
I'm sorry I'm a dirty dirty boy I'm a shotgun ape that uses shoulder bashes I'm not a good person but I get what I need
---
At the moment, it is not possible to get Saint-14's Grey Pigeon. Same goes for a good majority of the cosmetics sold by Tess in past seasons, although she does sell old legendary/rare items like ships and emotes on occasion. Bungie did try something a few months back where they sold old emotes for silver, but it didn't go too well and they haven't attempted it since. 
---
Meh, I've been that guy before and it just simply feels cheap. 
---
I feel like a dragonfly mod is better considering the drop mag.
---
Literally just got one today. I had deleted my other copy yesterday. :(
---
As I stand there just blasting riven with malfeasance 
---
I've never gotten one but I assume they're random. 
---
Took me 82 powerful frames before I got my first curated roll, so yeah, RNG!
---
Ok neckbeard
---
and yet soul-crushing at the same time :\\ 
---
Holy cow
---
That’s what I want :)
---
Oh yes. Rough. The forge is the definition of a grind. Look it up. Google grind and you’ll see a titan crying into the slowly cooling slag of a melted floating forge citadel.
---
The matchmaking in destiny happens between the 2 fire team leaders.
---
The closer the two leaders = a better connection
---
Connection is a large factor in matchmaking.
---
Just an example, in destiny 1, before private matches were a thing, my buddies and I would both match up in a public playlist at the same time and almost always match with each other.
---
(Also sweats were hosted in public matches using this method, very silly i know)
---
made a new account just to post this haha, loser.
---
Wish we could equipped shields... wish Destiny and titanfall had a baby... or destiny and Anthem’ flying mechanics... I just want a ultra mobile destiny... 
---
thanks was confused

Oh you’d be surprised loool 
---
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **1st Cakeday** Nadious! ^(hug)
---
Its anime, thats why it says he has no friends.
---
I agree, you should use slightly worse shotguns tbh. 
---
Looks like something from D1 not d2
---
I remember watching it, but can't remember anything about it. Looks like I need to rewatch it.
---
Disgusting weeaboos
---
That could explain a shit ton of things here
---
That’s a d1 set 
---
Right? I know it's RNG, but it feels more like reverse duplicate protection sometimes.
---
The number of times I got a new piece of exotic gear or an exotic weapon to drop, only for the next or two next exotics to be the exact same thing.
---
I am so bummed out by the fact the only exotic I really wanted from the first moment I saw it - Ursa Furiosa - just seems to not exist in my game. It's the only Titan exotic I still don't have. It's come to the point where I don't really care or bother anymore to grind out powerful gear drops for a chance at it.
---
Getting my umpteenth Jade Rabbit, Peacekeepers or screebin' Otherside (I know this is a different kind of exotic drop, but still) is getting old.
---
Wait the Polaris 3 taps?
---
I love it, the Izanagi Burden masquerading as an actual sword. I can hear the "sheen!" already.
---
My bad! I’ll remove them and repost in the appropriate sub 
---
Mara had a wish and shaxx brought his boom stick...giggity giggity

You can get enhanced perks from the fated engram 
---
Thank you for the warm wishes.a
---
conga rats. I got to the elevator and gave up.
---
I feel I can genuinely say that Crucible is the most unpleasant experience I've had playing a multiplayer game in my entire life. No matter how I play I just get completely shat on. I can't even seem to make shotguns work. 
---
Couple that with playing from Australia so I can't get good hitreg and it's just a terrible experience. I hate it.
---
Yes but it all depends on luck - it's now a random drop.
---
Grav? You serious? Who hurt you dood?
---
And it's a fucking blind shot too! This is amazing!
---
Thanks that's all I needed to know
---
What is it with people and comparing everything to destiny? 
---
Just the single guardians doing their stuff in crimson days 
---
You must do heroic spire integration specifically in the Hallows on Nessus.
---
I agree

Damn

The middle of an even number, lol.

Get heart thing and ruin people fun. Sounds great right? 
---
Or actually put matchmaking in for raids n nightfalls too much effort to have to go to something like the companion app to find people to do it with never understood why they never had matchmaking in them
---
Corn sword
---
YES!!! Just noticed that!! 
---
I tried tripmines just now in crimson doubles and you’d be surprised with the amount of times people run into those 
---
It’s super fun btw even without Young Ahamkaras spine
---
I hope we get Uldrens new Forsaken cloak down the line the cowboy poncho cape looks so cool
---
To be fair some people still don’t have 1k voices after 50+ runs. That’s kind of ridiculous tbh, especially when rewards are limited weekly so you can’t just keep farming it until you get it like Borderlands.
---
Lol get gud 
---
Oh ur right im stupid. Was thinking of the wrong thing
---
Why try to get better when you could just complain about how bad the meta is and have thousands validate you? 
---
I don’t see it 
---
Go ahead and r/whoosh me
---
You can solo all of eow except the first section.
---
More like when an exotic drops and you think it’s  gonna be Geomags or Phoenix protocol, after 5 months of horse shit, but it’s actually just Aeon Soul. I don’t even use my warlock often, but wtf bungo? I’ve done 95% of all weekly rewards for the past 5 months and you’re still shitting on me with dupes.
---
if they could just nerf the range on shotguns and give them a sharper damage fall off i think that'd fix a lot of issues
---
To stand out as a skilled player or use your skills to keep others from achieving success?
---
I mean, if I were that good at pvp I would be merciless too. 
---
But trials simply allowed the best players to ensure any player with less skill could never succeed.  Anyone can succeed in PvE. 
---
In comp you can at least grind out enough lucky matches to succeed eventually.  A pvp main though will always only have one reply, no matter what anyone says. 
---
Now that I think about it it's mostly the Western MMOs that have overly contrived raids 
---
Im pretty sure lunas howl and not forgotten arent even visible in the collections until you obtain them.
---
Because hits are reg by the server but models are done via client side. So theres a disconnect when ping is high enough.
---
Now most games get around this problem (because of lag switching aka introducing packet loss on purpose) by just banning those people. But destiny kinda doesnt do that...
---
I am shit at sniping, but the blue sniper called the aachen feels like a longbow. I got my first sniper we ran out of medals using this yesterday
---
That’s what you call an account recovery. He makes a new account to post on the destiny app so his main account can’t get banned. And then you pay him to let him play on your account.
---
Do you seriously think a serious post, would have an anime girl with guns?
---
&gt;I tried to fist him in the ass and I missed.
---
This would be fairly awkward irl.
---
Where do you get that 
---
I know what an account recovery is. But that makes sense.... I was super confused lol
---
And he has less time to play than others? 
---
[removed]
---
Considering this is the internet, I do think some people would do that
---
I won against a meta af Dustrock Not Forgotten Wardcliff One Eyed in Crimson Doubles just staying ranged,  he got PISSED. 
---
I have got 11 exotics in 3 days (none from xur)
---
You’re extrapolating your experience to fit those thousands of people you keep mentioning. We don’t have any actual stats on LFG
---
Yea, it just needs rampage
---
There is plenty of shit you can do solo. Don’t act like there isn’t.
---
What makes raids cool and different is their reliance on teamwork to pull through. Making it an activity that you could easily just do solo would make no sense.
---
In

The
---
#***DEEEEEEEEEPPPPPPPPP.***
---
Well you used to be able to solo Crotas end, but now there really isnt anything that fun to do as a solo player. 
---
I'd rather not get an exotic than get a duplicate. The feeling of disappointment is just annoying now. 
---
Were you marked all the time? 
---
Mr.jasonTe troll king, king of the trolls.
---
I still need to do it, I'm too bad to do it solo
---
Because new players will try it, have a shit experience, and be put off. I don't think we should let a small group bang their heads against a wall to the detriment of others.
---
AS titan only player i can say this is fucking disgraceful,disrespectful and pathetic even i hate that fucking mask.
---
Yup. Had to be careful about positioning to pick them off one at a time. 
---
Best place to find people would be the LFG discord https://discord.gg/tEstSzA
---
I can't speak for that but I have to say at least half the Last Wish segments just aren't fun to do.
---
Yeesh
---
Gotta love it when the model of an attachment to the main model decides to F off to the origin point LOL
---
Ikelos sg first escalation protocol run
---
This is pre-nerf btw, forgot to mention that
---
yeah the only reason its getting changed is because it required rebinding keys/macros to do... otherwise they would have left it alone like they did in d1
---
I still dont fully understand this mentality. It is so easy to use the 3rd party LFG tools to find a raid group. You dont have to be outgoing and social to find a group either, its not like they're going to interview you or anything. Just make a post on one of them saying "First Time doing Last Wish or Scourge LFG" and you'll find people who will Sherpa you or others who are doing it for the first. Last night i used the PC LFG discord and DestinyLFG.net to help my friend do LW and SOTP for the first time and we ended up playing with 4 people who never did the raid before and had a great time. You just have to have a mic and be willing to listen and learn.
---
that ace ain't gonna do shit To "alduin". what we need is an elder scroll!
---
The doubles format is really fun! I wish it came around more than once a year because I think's my favorite Crucible mode.
---
Its 2nd week
---
All you have to do is force yourself through an LFG raid and you'll understand why solo raids or matchmaking would make raids horrible.
---
If you don't want to play in groups and chat, then you don't want to raid. Cooperating with other people to conquer the challenge is what makes it worthwhile.
---
Unfortunately I feel the same way.
---
I never get to play raids with my friends, use LFG services to complete coop activities
---
My buddy I play with really doesn’t enjoy it at all, but ever since the bow came out I can’t get enough of it.
---
I admit it took a minute to adjust my tactics but I find pvp to be my favorite now and it feels like a different beast when you play the bow right
---
Download the companion app especially if you're on the PC
---
Ok thank you!
---
Ah thanks 
---
The weapons you obtain without frames are updated Y1 weapons. The frame weapons are completely new weapons.
---
Oh that’s sick thanks 
---
Dancing on ice but with a bunch of titan mains
---
Bruh, only exotics I don't have is Ursas and the fuggin' mask. I was doing all the reset powerful gear stuff with a friend the other day; I stayed on my Titan all night, he got the mask the first thing we did, then got 2 more exotics, changed over to his warlock and got 2 more. 5 in one night ....I can't even think of a meme to show my disappointment of all repeats on my end.
---
If you're absolutely confident you can clear raids with matchmaking, regardless of the quality of the other players, then LFG should be a piece of cake for you.
---
Gambit auto rifle doesn’t matter. You can easily get the kills by the time you play 40 matches. I used a random blue (rare)one I picked up, and still have knocked all the quest steps out in under 20 rounds
---
Light levels matter in gambit against other players but not in pvp. There really isn't a reason to infuse crucible weapons. I just do it because I have enough materials to do it.
---
At least now you can wear your burger flair and flex
---
Ironically, going into your inventory lengthens the loading lol
---
sorry, what are you referring to? the forge emblem?
---
My fellow Titan, all I can say is
---
F
---
I've spent my entire Saturday killing fallens and haven't gotten the key. 'we got your money'? Damn right they did!! Pocketed it and forgot to fix their shiits! 
---
Shhhhh.... quiet!
---
Watch a video on Whisper. That jumping puzzle is no fucking joke.
---
They should just quit the game
---
It's been inconsistent as hell since they "fixed it"
---
That's weird, I thought I matched with people and did strikes with them every day this week. I must have been hallucinating
---
It was a bug, you just have to wait for the bow frame to come back into rotation And you can get it again
---
Brilliant! Lol
---
Is thunderlord a forsaken weapon or can it drop from xur?
---
Gratz x2 xd
---
That's so Titan of you, thanks.
---
Now that's a God roll
---
I mostly play solo at this point.
---
The only reason I’m looking down on you is because you’re trying so hard to be a martyr.
---
I think Forsaken should of been more "cowboy"y.
---
Yes. This is still nerfed.
---
Only vanilla story quests will give powerful gear 2x (like MIDA/STURM quests), and are capped at 380.
---
Every other drop you get will be a normal underleveled legendary/exotic drop.
---
I mean it would be great if the raids in Destiny worked like the ones in World of Warcraft. In that, if you wait 5 years, your characters become so powerful that you can just one shot all enemies.
---
Join a clan on /r/Fireteams. Best decision I've ever made playing video games. 
---
Yeah, nothing in the captain/Minotaur/knight/centurion class of enemies.
---
It’s 17
---
This is going to be my example when people ask me why I'm glad Anthem isn't going to have PVP. PVE balance/fun stuff/being overpowered is always ruined by the PVP balance fun police. Getting to be overpowered is one of the best parts of any RPG, one of my favorite parts in Diablo, one of my favorite parts in Borderlands.
---
I'll be your friend*! I don't have any value, but I can do ^this!
---
*friendship subject to terms and conditions
---
Do you know what an artist and a sniper have in commo- *gets blown into 50 pieces*
---
I don't fully know the mechanics behind these drops, do certain ones (besides quest ones of course) not drop from the engram Xur gives once a week?
---
There are solo activities on destiny as well are you kidding me? There is matchmaking for people not in a fire team as well. Did WoW make 40 man raids able to be solo’d while they are relevant? How about any raids? How about m+? 
---
All I’m saying, is if he isn’t using the tools there that are meant to be a large area of the game, that’s on him. 
---
You can lead a horse to water, can’t make him drink. No matter how much he complains about being thirsty. 
---
I can’t believe I read the whole post... 
---
One second, I need Google lol
---
Not elitist. They’ve experienced the content and know it’s a bad idea. 
---
Don’t buy a game that’s multiplayer endgame if you want to play solo. 
---
Wrong franchise. 
---
Alright then.
---
Lazy and entitled. That’s all you need to know. 
---
Any kind of ideas to help new or solo players are always shut down here.
---
What’s a blueberry 
---
&gt;there are solo activities on destiny as well
---
Never said there wasn’t
---
&gt;All I’m saying is...
---
No, you used the “MMO MEANS MULTIPLAYER SO DEAL WITH IT” argument that is quite honestly invalid because Destiny isn’t a MMO. If it considers itself one, then it is an extremely shallow one due to the lack of content.
---
You don't even need friends. Bungie has made apps for people to find raid players
---
I just got my 4th sunshot since Forsaken came out.... like I needed another. I am still missing a majority of the random drop forsaken weapons especially QB and its so infuriating, that I cant get those things.... let a lone the damn ghost shell so I can finally get curse breaker.  
---
Because it’s not the idea people want to hear. 
---
They want a low/no effort solution that does not exist because it will be a a shit show. Those of us that have done the content know that. 
---
Guess how new players can learn content? Ask for help, find people to play with, and put some effort in. If that’s not the answer you want it’s too bad because it’s the only one. 
---
cant feel the love if i queued solo and get partnered with people who cant hit their tethers
---
You can still get it for sure, I just had it drop twice in the last couple days by doing routine weekly PvE activities.
---
Great... Now I need to make a D2 clip with dragonforce music
---
I had to stop about halfway through. I was afraid the stroke OP was having might be contagious.
---
"He did it so it's OK that I did it"
---
The Colonel is down there!? Well now I have good reason.
---
Was good play before the bag, though. 
---
Yeah. He's just to the right of this picture in Cause's little workshop. Her, Xur and the secret room are the only reasons I go to that section of the tower anymore
---
You definitely can gain more skills from playing and learn strategies. Just like raid videos on YouTube you can look up PvP videos along with gambit videos. You can look up tips and tricks for all of them as well. Maybe some people are naturally better at it but that doesn’t mean you can’t improve. I’m not a phenomenal PvP player but it made it to the lighthouse a couple of times and even managed to scrounge up the scarab. I don’t understand all this bickering and whining. For some people it’s all about the story for others the raids and then you got the PvP players and more recently the gambit fans. Why can’t we just be glad Destiny provides so many different game types? I can understand the want for Trials back because all PvP players have right now is Iron Banner which would be like comparing Nightfall and Raids to be the same. Now please everyone stop acting like 8-14 year olds unless you’ll be leaving to play fortnite or apex soon
---
I went flawless in D1 Trials a couple times definitely tough but could be done.
---
I mean, no. Cmon
---
Best jumps = best vertical movement 
---
Best class ability =best horizontal movement 
---
Does it not only drop from calus?
---
Oh butts of course I haven't seen this secret room, even MORE reason to go now. Thanks!
---
I've had d2 since. Calus normal completion left a bad taste in my mouth. Never attempted another raid
---
Yeah should be a bunch of youtube vids on it. Not much to see, just fun to do really
---
Lol no. PVE has a history of suffering because Bungie wants to try and appease the pvp players. There shouldn't be any endgame pvp content comparable to raids. The fact that you have pvp should be enough. Pvp is a side part of the game, it does nothing to advance the story and adds very little to the lore. It shouldn't be the focus of endgame content.
---
No, his inventory stays the same over the weekend. Just gotta check every Friday to see what he has
---
good bad joke, take orange arrow
---
No u
---
No you both
---
Not everyone wants to suffer through an ocean of losses to claim one victory through sheer luck. 
---
It says 4 months ago in the title.
---
1. Tatara Gaze, Bite of the Fox. Prioritize rolls with snapshot for both PvP and PvE. Kill Clip on tatara gaze for 1hko body shots in PvP.
---
2. Parcel of Stardust with a full-auto roll is the best option here. Toil &amp; Trouble is frustratingly slow, but strong. Perfect Paradox is usable.
---
3. Duke, Better Devils, Wardens Law, Crimil's Dagger. Only WL can roll with feeding frenzy. Otherwise you're always looking for Outlaw/Rampage, for PvE. 
---
4. Smugglers Word, Last Hope, imo. Don't use sidearms much.
---
5. Curated Age Old Bond or Hazard of the Cast.
---
It used to be only calus, but it was changed with patch 1.1.2 (1/30/2018). It can now drop from any encounter 
---
You didn’t have to do it for any reason you could reach max light through raids and I’m just saying you didn’t have to be a sweaty to make it and no it wasn’t sheer luck. It took some strategy and good teammates that coordinated well but so do most difficult raids
---
Yeah, unfortunately I already had the shader.
---
Wish-Ender is the best bow by far. Arsenic Bite/The Vow could be the best legendary bow.
---
I was gonna make this comment if nobody else already did.. lol.
---
Thanks! Will definitely have alot of fun with this thing! :)
---
Then why shouldn’t just the story be enough for you? You have multiple raids and the others should just be happy with the PvP they have? It must’ve been nice getting everything you wanted as a kid
---
Very impressive! I always loved using Better Devils too, before I got Midnight Coup
---
I like to skate in PvE but I still main hunter in PvP and I can't say I see the issue. The only thing making titan OP is OEM. It's as simple as that. Skating doesn't really work that well in PvP since there aren't that many long lanes. If you're running Lion Rampant it can be good but then you're using an exotic slot that should be saved for OEM anyways.
---
I've got back to you. The enemy in question literally does not affect a pre bound macro on your keyboard.
---
I didn't know that when I posted, excuse me
---
Yes, what's the masterwork? And put dragonfly spec mod on. 
---
Just missing 1k Voices now.
---
Tho my raid team (or better said the group of people from my clan regulary attending our clears) has pretty good luck in the last weeks with ~2 dropping per weekly reset.
---
Yes. I'm a Yank
---
That's basically what the curated one looks like.
---
It’s really good for ad clear. It would be better to have rampage spec or dragonfly spec on it though 
---
That’s correct. Not sure what you’re proving here. There are some solo aspects to the game. If that’s not enough, you’re in the wrong game. 
---
Have you even played the class?  Or are you just speaking based on assumptions?  Because it looks like the former.  Sentinel is literally the worst of the classes for PvP, and not that great for PvE.  The only thing that sentinel has that's worth anything is the suppressors.  Other than that, the neutral game is trash, the melees are garbage, and the supers are lack luster.  You actually lose speed in sentinel super for some unknown reason and it's extremely easy to run away from one because of it.  It isn't even good in mayhem because enemy supers can stagger you in your super while you're guarding, meaning they can kill you while you're stunned.

But hey, it's OP because it sounds OP, that's how science works!
---
Only a weeb would make fun of another weeb. It’s what we’re best at after all

PvE has larger maps and is the only place where you can actually take advantage of higher speeds. It's hard to steer -&gt; hard to control. I remember having an argument with someone almost a year ago (before forsaken) about how you should always run Lion Rampant because titan's are unplayable without skating and they told me skating is useless and stupid because it's too hard to do and I got downvoted. Like I said, you die to collision damage most of the time and unless you're using it on PvE maps where you have a straight and easy to navigate path in front of you, it really isn't even that useful without Lion Rampant.
---
Nobody can complain about balancing if they can't play
---
You have gots it
---
Itd be pretty annoying if it was a constant quest marker literally anywhere you stood in the dreaming city.
---
I mean, did you try listening to the dialogue? Why were we charging the well? Why was all that power being diverted under the dreaming city? Why is the first thing that Petra says when you talk to her during max curse week, "the portal open"?
---
Congrats....??
---
Exactly,only multiplayer games suck,i wasted money finding this out
---
What do you mean “the original way” ?
---
This post has the big gay but that's how it be
---
Is that an Ahamkara, Riven? I thought Riven was that meatball thingy?
---
Ya got 1 titan with banner shield, 2 with melting point, and 2 hunters with golden gun with nighthawk or blade barrage with shards of galanor, and 1 with Luna factions and well of radiance. That's just how I run it with my clan. I'm sure everyone's stats are diffrent. And as a warlock main I can say warlock jumping sucks hard ass
---
Nope
---
I put targeting adjuster on mine. I actively reload in PvE and I’m concerned with running out of almost due to drop mag, so I’m avoiding backup mag on it for now. I’m getting used to aiming with it but those three taps are super crispy. I’m in love!
---
It's all about hip fire my man.
---
Got it, thanks. Hope your luck turns around!
---
What system ?
---
Xbox one. Thank you for the comment. Lol.
---
It looks like dire promise but idk
---
 Sure only the goZen c with crowd control could do that ( in super or not)
---
I just want nighthawk xur. I know you sold it just a few weeks ago but I hadn't started yet so it's only fair
---
Took me 45 ;(
---
This may be the best piece of destiny art I have ever seen. 
---
Maybe it's just me, but I always like to stop and wait up for my fireteam. It's one thing if they're abysmally slow, but all this Titan had to do was wait.
---
Lol you're almost 50? I highly doubt it. I'm close to 30. Talking shit? I didnt realise calling someone a kiddo is talking shit? Is your supposed age suppose to scare me? If you are really that old then beating your ass irl would be a cake walk. But tough guys on the internet and all that 
---
Save some of that salt for later 
---
You can’t pay for any weapons in this game though..... unless you’re in korea
---
Riven is a taken Ahamkara, even stronger than a normal one. And let's not forget that during the Great Hunt the guardians almost exterminated that species.
---
I've still never beaten LW
---
Is there a higher resolution version?
---
Oh I see Balrog has made his debut
---
*Makes fun of people who talk shit online*
---
*Doesn’t like that someone disagrees with him, talks shit online*
---
Outstanding move
---
You threatening me ?
---
Lol wut. That guy started talking shit first. Am I not allowed to talk shit back? And what disagreement are you referring to?
---
1 warlock is sufficient to match 3 Titans and 2 Hunters ;)
---
True. Why, tho?
---
CITIZENS OF DALARAN
---
He’s probably referring to paying for someone to get the weapon for you. 
---
That’s the only thing I haven’t tried yet. Anyone wanna help me out on the raid that gets you the 3rd seed of light?
---
deflecting? no, merely pointing out that you implied you wanted to bend me over your knee and spank me, and the only reason I can see you wanting to do that to a grown ass man is because youre gay. I don't judge, but it's not for me. It's also pretty pedo, considering you seem to like to pretend the guy you wanna spank is a child.
---
They just drop occasionally from legendary drops, from Scrapper Bounties, or from buying them from the Spider (Forsaken)
---
That's good to know, thanks.
---
Dont let old age fool ya kid. Might get caught off guard. Again....good day.
---
They’re just not dropping. 
---
Ah!  I’ve been doing them without really knowing the curse week. Didn’t even know that was a thing. I’ll try it next week and get back to you. Thanks man. 
---
Look I don't explain myself normally but u seem to be. Special snowflake so if u can stop trying to eat and lick ur own ear il tell u a story.
---
Go to bed.
---
Nobody is dabbing 
---
2/10 not enough realism 
---
What do you do to start the glide sir?
---
good day? what are you trying to be some noble man who hid his anger and walked away? lmao holy shit, how cliche. trying to seem like you weren't just being an immature child trying to offend a stranger. enjoy you're prescription meds old man.
---
I don't mess around on reddit much. I just use it to reference ttks and stuff like that.
---
I just thought it was funny that's all, teammates name and the enemies clan tag. 
---
Lolololololololololololololololololololol
---
Dont hit the wife over this, not her fault 
---
Could be asking if he played up against the clan leader of a well known clan? 
---
now who's deflecting? still playing that weird ass dad role huh? it's getting creepy man, I don't want to sleep with you. and it seems like youre the one with repressed memories bud. what with you continuing the pedo fetish stuff.
---
jump them press the jump button again. then you can glide for a hell of a long time. Strafe glide for control and finesse
---
burst glide for quick speed
---
and balanced glide....we don't talka bout that
---
same... started when destiny2 (basegame) was free on [battle.net](https://battle.net)! know im sitting on a warlock and hunter with 650... have done a damn grind for wayfarer and so on xD
---
never thought getting hooked that hard... but here we are!
---
That was you only good line, well done. I actually laughed at that one
---
An eye for an eye.
---
You almost got the Curated Roll
---
inb4 his characters are deleted lol
---
woah, maybe you beat your wife, but I actually love mine. that wife beating shit was your generation
---
Ooo...skullfort with hands-on? *pyrrhic victory* emotes
---
Not a big fan of blink tbh
---
64. 
---
Yeah that makes sense actually. 
---
Such a cutie 
---
I'm not deflecting I just don't get into talks of pedophelia when I have 4 of my own children,
---
Putting someone over your knee is chastising like giving ur kid a clip for being a little bugger. The fact you turned the little banter we re having to pedo talks speak volumes of ur upbringing and mindset so with that I'm gunna leave u to your perverse mind and wish u well.
---
It’s really not hard to avoid shotgunners
