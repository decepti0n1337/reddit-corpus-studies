Its not supposed to, but this bug has been around since gambit came out. I cant recall if bungie ever figured out what the problem is.

Do not speak of the cursed one

Thron
---
Why not?
---
Well I'm kinda done, thought forsaken would make it worth my time, I was mistaken.
---
U right so he lying or missing details
---
Is it faster to post a question to Reddit and wait for an answer, or just Google it?
---
Ah, crap.. never run it and all my regulars stopped playing :(
---
Googled and couldn’t find anything, also i like the community? Sorry my question offended you. 
---
Gotcha thanks!
---
It was a legit question - wasn't trying to clown you.
---
This is so low effort. 
---
🥛

---
Voice of riven sir
---
Started playing like 3-4 months after forsaken &amp; I’m only 620 across my 3 characters so I’m in the same boat. Never done any forge besides the Volundr. So that means still no Jotunn for me :-( 
---
^ This is the correct answer, and well worded too, cheers man. I feel like Bungie should just remove the option to log in with Google until it's fixed, cause it looks pretty bad.
---
Also in case anybody else is struggling with this, I just made a Bungie password and logged in with that instead.
---
Honestly getting tired of this bullcrap.

Not too late at all. Plenty to do in here and plenty of us to help you if needed.

This is the perfect time.

Hawkmoon. Thorn doodoo
---
Just watched a video called "Anarchy vs every strike boss" and it was quite entertaining.
---
No offense but I had no idea people actually used sidearms lol. 
---
Ive seen that pop up in my recommendations alot is it worth watching?
---
Yeah agreed,  there's so much to do while you level up. I think the series is in the best place it's ever been!!
---
It's never too late. 
---
Can I get in on this too?
---
I've often wondered this. Used to play an mmo FFXI and one of the keys to raid completions was mixing your weapon skills (supers). Although we do have some synergy like you mentioned I think timing your supers, abilities, and grenades with other or same element guardians for an effect would really top it off. 
---
Ugh, i'm the same; primarily grinding solo and haven't gotten much past 1000. It's infuriating but I just can't give up. 
---
He just has a lot of health. If you are having trouble, increase your power level a bit more. 615 was the bare minimum I was able to defeat him at, and it was only if I happened to be matched with good, well-prepared teammates. 
---
Use a boss killing super and heavy weapons. I use Sleeper Simulant, but other options would be thunderlord or DARCI. 
---
Seriously doubt that, people pay a fortune for that stupid gun. From what I've heard, if you're not good enough to get it, you probably won't be good using it. Full disclosure....I don't have it for this very reason 
---
It's not too late to start. The biggest hurdle will be that many guides for earlier content are out of date, but for the most part quests are all the same, it's just the economy that is different (various in-game currecies have been shuffled around a bit). 
---
I see you also got the colonel's salute ornament
---
Cape-Tangled web cloak (has a spiderish symbol on it)
---
Helmet-celestial nighthawk (my guess on best for that helm)
---
Boots-stompees, prodigal or Wing contender are pretty simple
---
That’s all I got

Into the depths of hell! Jk we will see how the nerf affects them. 
---
That's super lame... How are people not mad about this 
---
Forsaken is an add-on to the base version of the game. You can buy just Forsaken. When you go to the store and click on Forsaken, it displays three versions. When you scroll down, it says that the two more expensive ones come with the base game as well, so you only need to buy the $40 one. That sounds like a lot, but it adds 3 new campaigns, 4 new planets, a new multiplayer mode, and various strikes, crucible maps, and side quests. 
---
Thank you I appreciate it !
---
Its great content
---
How did you got cayde's cloack?
---
Now this is the kind of shitposting I'm here for.  A+
---
True, but if there wasn't cover every two steps then we would see more mid to long range 1v1 engagements that end with a guardian down rather than dip behind cover and regen HP.   In lower ranks you get more oblivious players, but at higher ranks anything other than surprise rush attacks or teamshotting is generally a stalemate.  
---
Thorn! You could say "Any last words" as a compliment to the last word drawing

Noooooo. I love Hawkmoon but we but we already have too many exotic hand cannons, and I’m still not over Bungo not bringing Bad Juju back with Forsaken (seriously, they put Toland in the game but not his badass gun?!).
---
I'll give you and up vote because Dark Souls games are my favorite. 
---
Or, ya know, just get your kill and move on. 
---
They weren’t ready to challenge Destiny.

Annual pass is worth it especially with jokers wild coming in a week

Where do you find The Supremacy and Techeun Force?
---
if you cant earn it you DO NOT deserve it.
---
Garden of elesia* or whatever near Petra 
---
I don’t understand it either, honestly I just don’t care about either side. They’re both essentially the same with proclaimed rights that they apparently don’t have. It’s all overdramatized nonsense. 
---
If you read Petra's Ascendant Challenge bounty, it will give you a clue. 
---
Lota people who don’t know what they’re talking about in here. That’s a cool tattoo. Looks like it came out great. If you’re happy with it, who cares what anyone says.
---
Yeah, I went from using Linears to machine guns because I can do more damage with my Hammerhead which has the benefit of being void matching the envoy’s shields.

I have mained my Warlock from day one from Destiny 1.

But i maybe make a Titan only for PVP . That clip is one example why.
---
It's not even the lack of rights, but lack of care for men which these movements and this meme try to portray.
---
I didn't come here to tell you about it, just that it is a valid notion for countries like the states.
---
The Nokris boss fight every damn time!!
---
Pretty sure you need [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) to download it.
---
's kinda the point, too. A weapon made in Light and Dark is kinda what the Drifter is looking to introduce.
---
That was painful to watch, but I related to it so much.

This is the best destiny meme I’ve ever seen.

I've seen perks on BA weapons that I've never even seen before. Pretty cool, but it adds more variables to mess up my God rolls.

Ehh I don't really want to make a account on a different forum but I guess I'll look into it. 
---
Poor dog....What was the dog thinking that biting it won't do any shiet at the tank. :/
---
Congrats man! It's something to be proud of.
---
I don’t envy that grind at all. I only started to focus on LH at the second half of this season, so just has the time to get to Fabled. Wish you the best of luck in getting it. 
---
It feels near impossible with all the 4 stack consistent legend players who employ every meta tactic and exploit to win. Plus you run into cammy's crew once in a while and get bodied. Good luck to you anyways.
---
Ty and congrats
---
Ty man i need it lol
---
Thanks, man. I got 1k voices in LW last week and people in my FT were congratulating me. It felt undeserved as it’s just RNG. This - this is something you have to work at and by God does it feel good to achieve it!
---
I’m well aware of shard it keep it if you actually read my post I’m not asking about what to keep or shard I’m asking for opinions on mods for weapons I’m keeping. 
---
Git gud ???
---
We had to wipe heart run a few times last night due lag/glitches and 2 anthem playing guardians said they were still having more fun compared to anthem
---
Nope. it's: bow, hand cannon, auto rifle
---
F
---
I would have gotten it yesterday, but the enemy team got into the lead AFTER the timer run out, so they won. :)
---
This really shouldn’t be a thing. Bungie need to sort this out for next season. 
---
Yeah ive been trying
---
The point is you can look there and if there is no answer to your question, you can also ask there.
---
This is why I stopped it’s been going on since destiny started...
---
yeah, it's really frustrating to see the "victory" at the end of the match and then still lose the game.. 
---
but congrats to you, i'll get mine tonight for sure ;)
---
This is exactly right. I think realistically 35-40 is probably the highest possible.
---
How my guy I didn’t even know this thing existed!?
---
You on PS4? If we plan ahead I’d love to join you on these. My gf plays too. She and I would definitely need some practice on D1 though.

Not sure where you are stuck, here is the full quest:

---
Look for the Forsaken symbol on the map. From what I'm reading, it says return to Spider, not Petra.
---
Not OP but with least disparity between subclasses. Warlocks are space trashcans and hunters have Broken Blades, nuff said :)
---
I'm trying to get streaks of 5-kills with Redrix's Broadsword but I either run into teams that don't suck and I can't get them or the team DOES suck and before I get a decent streak going Shaxx mercies them. 
---
Look buddy I just want to see the loot this season will bring 
---
Season 6 engram!
---
Cheers bud. 
---
I was looking at running maybe ace or even a auto like tigerspite. I was playing around with a bow just running around killing trash it was fun. As I’m still learning the game I change loadouts quite a lot depending on situations like gambit depending on what I’m facing I’ve got riskrunner skyburners oath whatever the situation calls for. 
---
We must refrain from leaking out
---
Congrats I’ve been meaning to do the corrupted and keep progressing this, guess I’ll wait for the new season and chase it down it certainly looks cool as hell probably one of the best looking hand cannons I’ve seen 
---
You'll want to let people know what platform you are playing on too.
---
As far as I know, the light level matters vs the other team, but not against the mobs.
---
O_O lol XD I forgot thanks for that.
---
Nice job dude, and nice fashion! :D
---
Ah, thank you for the update! I've been mixed up about all sorts of stuff lately.
---
Hahahahhahah well you can say "está muy bien" or "es muy bueno" but you know nice try :D
---
I'll give that a shot. I thought the marker looked funny all those times. 
---
I feel your pain. I'm on my 4th :(
---
nice try bungie
---
Alright I’ll level with u, it does feel bad when ur not the one with oem but honestly it makes me strategize and form new ways to combat the oem but also I guess I can see why people want it nerfed, idk to me it’s just sad cuz well I’m a titan main lol maybe bungee should add some exotics to combat it? Or un nerf worm husk ? Idk something 
---
Warden of nothing if you didn’t get to the chest before the bubble trapped your teammates
---
D2 feels way better than Anthem, by far.
---
I'm a vet on GW2 (11k hours) and Warframe (1.1k hours), at that point both of these games offer very little to me. Since Anthem beta was around, I figured I'd give it a shot. It felt sluggish, the flight felt like flying a ton of brick. Flight feels much better in WF, but I can understand that it's most likely just personal preference. And the loading screens... what the fuck with the loading screens.
---
So I just uninstalled Anthem, no way I was going to spend money on a game that didnt feel that great at first glance.
---
And then I remembered that I had D2 unlocked in my battle.net (I think I got it for free when it got added to the b.net launcher or something). I had never tried it, after all /r/warframe was all about shitting on D2 (one time use shader, they must be dumb, right? /s). But since I had given Anthem a chance, I figured I'd give D2 a shot too.
---
I have spent over 120h on D2 in the last 3 weeks. Send help, the game is too good for my own sake.
---
TL;DR; I tried Anthem, uninstalled 2h later. I tried D2, I'm 120h deep.
---
Thats unfortunate well I hop for you is going  on sell again during the new season I would still highly recommend it though I have 800+ hours in the game and still have yet to complete all my goals 
---
"actual skill" lmao
---
Allies to anthem as well lol

It's be like that for me for about 1 month and a half

It's my favorite rapid fire, But you're probably right, I've never seen anyone else use it.
---
This subreddit it already littered enough with such shitposts. Do not encourage them.
---
Do all the high level ones in 1 week and it is a pretty high drop chance. 
---
Not just the red marked one but the next ones also. 
---
nothing is going to be nerfed into the ground
---
&gt;    Shotguns
---
    In Season of the Drifter, we’re making a few changes to rapid-fire Shotguns, and the Full Auto perk. We're doing this for a few reasons, one of them being that the Full Auto perk feels far too important to Shotguns in PvE. This perk effectively doubles the damage output of any given Shotgun due to the rate of fire increase.
---
    While we believe it is important to have useful perks on your weapons, the efficacy of this was so impactful that rapid-fire Shotguns became the only Shotguns worth considering for PvE. When the following changes release in Season of the Drifter, we hope you might be inspired to equip an aggressive Shotgun or maybe even take a slug Shotgun for a spin in a PvE activity.
---
            Shotguns will receive a damage multiplier in PvE activities, effectively doubling their damage.
---
                    The Legend of Acrius is an exception to this.
---
            Full Auto rate-of-fire bonus for Shotguns is now +10%, down from +100%.
---
                    In addition, it no longer increases the Shotgun pellet spread.
---
            Default rate-of-fire values for have also shifted:
---
                    Aggressives are 55 RPM, up from 45 RPM
---
                    Precisions are 70 RPM, up from 55 RPM
---
                    Lightweights are 80 RPM (they were erroneously stated to be 90 RPM previously)
---
                    Rapid-Fire 140 RPM, down from 200 RPM (they were previously natively 100 RPM, but due to the intrinsic full auto, actually had 200 RPM)
---
                    Also reduced base damage for Shotguns across the board to align with their new rates of fire on a per sub-archetype basis.
---
            Ammo reserves for Shotguns were re-evaluated due to the increased efficiency of having more damage per shot.
---
    We also took the opportunity to slightly adjust Shotguns for the Crucible. While Shotguns will remain effective in the Crucible, we have toned down the range at which Shotguns could secure a one-shot kill.
---
Got mine last night with another Exotic Engram in wave 1, a curated drop, and some other neat stuff :)

Will black armory still be around?

Not super amazing but it’s competitive and is really fun because if someone pops their super or has an over-shield and doesn’t see you, you can often proc the 5 shots and kill them. Also, it’s rare-ish, but you can sometimes land 5 shots from long distance and get the proc to kill someone, so it’s hilarious to out-snipe someone with a hand cannon. 
---
It feels similar to ‘trust’ with the high stability, but since trust has explosive payload (flinch enemies), comparable damage and it doesn’t eat the exotic slot you’re probably better off with a decent trust roll. 
---
People hatin on you for being lucky lol
---
Thats your opinion 
---
How do the nightfall challenges work? Do you need to complete the challenge for a chance at the reward?
---
/s?
---
Not my randoms. I guess I just need to pay more attention to line of sight. But I can't say the same about my team(s). 
---
And I'm pretty good at Gambit, just pointing out a possible flaw in the mechanics. 
---
cheese, use all the pvp centric weapons/supers even if that means getting beat by adds. lmg/queenbreaker/wardcliff/colony and slova/bb/probably sentinel shield. hog the power ammo and save your super until its time to invade and then go ham. or just wait and pray you end up on a team with a 3 stack and one of them is a good designated invader
---
Me2
---
Kills and defeats are different. The number of kills is the number of guardians you got the killing blow on. Guardian defeats include assists and killing blows. 
---
Because they like playing competitive teams?  It is a grind to get it because it’s supposed to be a weapon that is not easily accessible. 
---
How? Just, how????? 
---
Study my bro, 
---
Had the same and leveld up my valor and got a queenbreakers bow. Was a nice surprise
---
spreading false information..
---
Look at the Y2 roadmap....
---
Not forgotten is twice the range I believe, so it's considerably better.
---
Yes, it’s also the opinion of 90% of D2s player base. 
---
Oh look a better, legendary Sunshot! 
---
How is your inventory too full to pick up a subclass??
---
Maybe if you and your SO got into a strike manually through the destination, you wont be put into matchmaking
---
I’m still convinced that it was secretly a sniper rifle that was just misidentified as a shotgun.
---
I was working on leveling a warlock on my level 20 account and hit level 20 then decided to get the other subclasses and since i had not finished the voidwalker i couldn't pick up storm
---
I wasn't successful with any hand cannon for weeks. I forced myself to get used to the Malfeasance. If you have the Trust from the Drifter, that is the best gun to complete the quest with!
---
O_O
---
Although I will say Chromatic Fire is the most disappointing exotic in the game. 
---
*rare
---
I think they are great solely due to the black armory symbols
---
Some exotics just shouldn't be. 
---
Age really doesn't mean anything bud, but grats anyway. 
---
No need to study when you're passing all your classes. 
---
I get elemental explosions on any kinetic sign me up!!!  
---
Oh it's a little poof like a second after they die and by then all the near by enemies have already scattered so it doesn't even do anything :(

Phoenix and Geomags are both pretty nice at least.

Mine is the ship from Shattered Throne. Haven't been trying as long as you have for the sparrow, but I know some have, and it's annoying since it only comes every 3 weeks.

---
Honestly with a subject line like that I'd be hearing Zavalas voice the whole time i read that email xD
---
If you're struggling against Jotunn to the point that you think Bungie should nerf it, you should probably just step away from PvP. Jotunn is laughably easy to outplay; once you realize there's a Jotunn on the field it's just a matter of using cover and movement to stymie that player. If you're not willing to put in the effort to do even that, PvP probably isn't for you.
---
I dont like Titans, we hunters gotta stay together.
---
🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
---
Nice 
---
Honestly that was my exact reaction. 
---
That isn't really the guns fault though. Plus it is really easy to not get killed by it. Just move. The reason you die right when you get in is because we have the same gambit spawns as when it first launched.
---
Yeah this is the one. Amazingly active. 
---
Get on it and get in some groups! 
---
It's for specific black armory "mod" called obsidian radiance dropping from Bergusia forge. Adds a little animation to BA weapons and +5% damage buff during forge ignitions.
---
Come out and go back into it. Destiny as a whole if need be. They obviously haven't fixed it! 
---
Yeah i would assume so
---
Gamer*
---
So relatable tbh
---
Did someone say Thunderlord?
---
Yes. The **only** thing that happens when the season changes is that no new forge things are added beyond what we have now, and your infamy, valor, and glory ranks are all set to 0. Despite everyone thinking (insert random thing here) will disappear, nothing else disappears. 
---
Has to be good it says Gaming Monitor.
---
It really isn't. It has really unreliable tracking, is super easy to evade, and has a really small blast. I am not saying it is shit. I am just saying it isn't OP in the slightest.
---
What happens if you don't get any schematics? I haven't seen one since warmind.
---
Ouch that’s the worst
---
It really isn't though. The only similarity is that it shoots projectiles. Telesto is close to being a rocket launcher because it has a viable blast radius.
---
I know that but they don't drop for me I've done them every week since forsaken came out.
---
Yo Brother Vance, upgrade this with your Osiris blessing and maybe I'll refer you to Osiris as his 'greatest follower'

This exact thing has made me think recently; there have got to be some matches where invading and wiping the team is NOT the best call. If I was playing against you, for instance, it would be MUCH more beneficial to simply try to kill you repeatedly rather than wipe the team and let you respawn.
---
This is the third time I'm removing this post.

Stop.

Consider this your last warning.

I really hate the Mercury flashpoint. Only reason being there’s so little to do on Mercury. Good to know all these other things though, I was wondering about the Ascendant challenge. Gotta do that yet.

It's random and for what it's worth the last time someone posted on reddit that he was selling the Midnight coup was in October. 
---
It's been my experience that usually when rare things pop from vendors someone posts about it like whenever Banshee sells super mods there is always someone who posts it.
---
I'm looking for it as well.
---
Essentially, they were designing the raids as the prestige and then dumbing it down for the normal version. They had to focus on making these extra mechanics that they felt were taking away from the raid they built. 
---
They wanted to just be able to focus on designing the one raid that felt complete to them with a higher quality feeling. 
---
And honestly, they did a great job with last Wish. It’s one of their best. 
---
Ahh, just wish they were easier to grind for

I’m gonna ask something real stupid so bear with me. The guardian you are opening the nodes with has started/completed the exotic quest that requires you to open the nodes right?
---
Pretty sure he is referring to setting the date in your console’s options to one day in the future, it will load you into instances by yourself but I don’t know if you both would load together. Worth a shot though.
---
I liked and commented.  Keep up the good work!
---
Thanks man

Maybe try expanding on your answer instead of posting a link. As you’re not the first person to just post a link to the sub it’s annoying when you ask a question and instead of an answer you get a link for the 10th or 15th time to the same sub I see at least probably 1 post a day where instead of an answer to a similar question people just post a link to that sub. As the old saying goes if you don’t have something to say don’t answer 
---
Nicely done.  I hope you all won that round too.
---
I used the vendor roll solar shotgun for solar kills on a bb hunter went pretty quick tbh
---
Huh?
---
Wishbringer that is
---
Thanks for the explanation. I have digged through an ME3 wiki but couldn't find the correct name. 
---
And after all I couldn't ignore the visual resemblance anyway...
---
You could have also actually answered with something more than a link and added the link as a footnote. Posting a link and nothing more isn’t exactly a helpful answer 
---
Riskrunner was the first exotic I ever got in D2 and I still use it 
---
if thats calus, then thats a pregnant warlock. 
---
Absolutely! Gotta support the little guys on YouTube.  I'm in the same exact boat so I can relate.  I play on Xbox like you.  Down for PvP sometime? 
---
it doesn't have god rolls but I still like it. Rolls are Adaptive frame, full bore, allow mag, opening shot, and under pressure.
---
Also after I posted this I got what I think to be a Trust god roll. Rolls are precision frame, small bore, tactical mag, Dragonfly, and explosive payload.
---
Wait till next week
---
Yes please let's ignore some of the most pressing matters in the game and nerf a gun that can be beaten by walking to the side..
---
Nice! Solo queue or stack?
---
Eh I already got to fabled after winning one more so
---
I'd say it's more like a Bygones, except that it fires one projectile instead of a burst, the projectile has travel time, it can one-hit kill, and the stats are somewhat different. Other than that, the differences are mostly cosmetic. And ammo type.
---
Yeah man! MY names original mythic 
---
Nah. It’s not powerful. I think it’s just right....... 
---
As somebody who has done this to just mess around and get eggs/lore items in the Corrupted, I'm sad to report that it will add team members :/
---
Poor boi good thing u got fabled 
---
This is the only solution I can think of as well
---
Depends on a lot of factors.
---
Choice 1. Do you want to stay as close the lore or stay within the game.
---
Choice 2. How is your character meant to be played as. Are they more of a loner, will they join a fireteam or will they be a scout/an actual hunter.
---
And based on those it can go a lot of ways. But i would advise to stay within the lore seeing it would be easier to design (seeing am also creating a hunter cosplay) and go with a more turn of the century of the 1800s and 1900s scout.
---
I literally cant get wins in gambit. For something that is a large portion of PvE, I really wish it was more chill
---
It's Bill Murray at the Kennedy Center's Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. 
---
really? damn...
---
I’m not sure, I’ll give it a try
---
That's Bill Murray 
---
Thanks! I'll definitely check out the forums then. Maybe we can play sometime. 
---
It’s competitive PvEvP. There’s never going to be chill when you play a competition against other players. 
---
well, obviously.
---
Maybe I should. I do really want to get used to the feel of a keyboard and mouse though. I'm just so noobish with it. 
---
They do update every day, it just depends what time zone you're in. Where I live Destiny doesn't reset until 2pm
---
Stack! Imagine that hell in solo queue lol. The strange thing was as a stack we didn't really encounter any other stacks which is strange because you'd think a lot of people would be going for it.
---
That sounds real nice 😊
---
He’ll NO!
---
99.999999%
---
If you dont want to play  and risk it, you can wait for reset. It will give you enough glory points to get you the Luna.
---
Yeah when my parents said I had a package I was mad confused

The Outrage is outrageous. 
---
Comp can be really tough on solo players - but if you’re used to quick play it also just may take some adjustment and then you’ll start doing better. The pacing is different for one thing due to smaller teams and the modes. And it’s sweatier. But once you start to get into the swing of it, it can be more rewarding than QP when you’re in the mood for it. 
---
Matchmaking at its finest.
---
It does have matchmaking based on level and skill BUT if you only have a few rounds in comp it is not going to be able to match you at all.
---
Quickplay has no matchmaking at all.
---
Trials didnt keep the "pros" contained in Trials, it just filtered them a bit on the weekends but outside weekends when Trials was not active it was the same as now.
---
Take a seat, young Skywalker.
---
This is r/absolutelynotmeirl, but luckily I do often pair with a buddy of mine who is insane at invading, so Gambit is still enjoyable for me lol.
---

This is a useful link for those that havent seen it.
---
If you are in a fireteam it will. Tested with escalation protocols. Only one person needs to set their clock, the lead.
---
Youre a solid.. 1 year and 5 months late
---
For hunters spectral blades are still strong. IMO they did nerf blade barrage but you can easily work around it. I’ve noticed I trade more because the explosion is what kills now instead of the knife. Arc staff is nice too. For titan they buffed fists so infinite shoulder charges are fun. I’ve always used hammers though. For warlocks nova bomb is strong and so is Dawnblade (I’m just bad with it). I usually use bottom tree stormcaller. You can get team shot at a distance but it’s easy to use 
---
My psn is stevedaboss4 I’ll be on tonight as well
---
Are you sure you had the chaperone and not just the quest? The quest for that came out with forsaken. 
---
I remember using it a few months after the game came out. 
---
Sorry I’m stupid. I just remembered it was in destiny 1. Sorry about that. 
---
Thank you for trying to help me though. 
---
No worries. If you want it you can still get it, it drops randomly as a questline. 
---
Thanks, I appreciate it. 
---
I saw that my team was way behind on our primeval damage and the other also was gonna out dps us so our only chance of us winning was if I invaded and got the four kill. And let me tell you it felt amazing when I actually pulled it off and watched their primevals health refill and watched my primeval'a health just get melted. Also got the last hit on our prime that round, best match of gambit I've ever played
---
No, you don't have to deposit 15, and you're right you should be depositing anytime you have 5 for this exact reason.
---
You know you can bank at any time right? You don't have to hold 15.
---
r/battlestations
---
Haha I’m like 10 hrs of trying it solo and still haven’t gotten past Vorgeth. I’m gonna try next curse week but by then I’ll have the Whisper catalyst. I noticed I was doing 20k less damage per shot on vorgeth than what videos were showing. I haven’t tried other weapons so maybe that was part of my mistake. I don’t know what else would kill him in one or two phases though. DARCI maybe. 
---
Bruh
---
Damn! I would've finally been in a legendary battle.
---
Nice screenshot, lol.
---
*screams*
---
That's how I got it the gravetide summoner bounty. 
---
I would prefer in-game match making or sociality (not a word), but taking the time to get the discord Destiny LFG stuff going was a huge help in getting Shattered Throne done and find groups for raids. My clan isn't that active to its helpful to be able to just go find a bunch of LFG people in discord.
---
There is are some places, the one I know best is on nessus in the hallows, where u can kill the first dreg that leaves the spawn area with the sunshot, and the delay of the explosion lasts long enough to chain to the next dreg that spawns. You can chain an explosion that lasts a really damn long time.
---
Could be lag you hit box might be behind you looking at you butt.
---
This gives an interesting insight to their net code

---
Yeah its only been done once with 4 I think
---
Bottom tree striker is op for gambit. I can keep that shit going for entire rounds. Crucible no not they are powerful. I'm not crying for need a so don't worry but they do give that power feeling when you jump on titan when you play other subclasses.
---
I soloed Shattered Throne for the first time this last weekend, but died over a hundred times learning how to do it. Now I know how to do it solo, I’m going to work on a flawless Shattered Throne run.
---
A good choice is also trust. Next step is hand cannon kills. So you'll get some good practice in along with the solar kills.  I'm upto the fabled  step. So I think I'm just going to wait for season reset. 
---
Hahahaha exactly...it's worth the many tries though...I kept going for the same chest every time and it finally paid dividends
---
What were they.
---
Full credit goes to SolarFlairYt, go check him out!

Everyone starts somewhere. Even the best of the best started at a .5

This was me in iron banana. I am not a smart pvper :(

Its happened forever.  Over damage him, but not kill him, he does this.
