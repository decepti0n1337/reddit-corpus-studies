Is it possible to learn this power.
---
---
---
I started four months ago and haven‚Äôt gotten a single drop.
---
Titan! But I love close up play and wrecking with my abilities
---
I still have my starting gear and just use that. Like I kept it for this day.
---
Yeah! Me too
---
Huh, looks like the end of CoO tower
---
Thinking ahead. I just ended up picking up the lvl 200 chest, gloves, and cloak from Hawthorne
---
I‚Äôm hardwired but had to port forward to get rid of this crap everything is much smoother now
---
Eat my fist

-Titan
---
Reminds me of the melee damage cancel from halo when you melee at the same time
---
That situation is both funny and annoying, like playing rock paper scissors but you both keep throwing down the same hand.
---
NEW AND IMPROVED MEXIDONG, now with bad juju!
---
Sorry if this offends you, but a.) nobody plays for honor in comp and b.) If a weapon is clearly superior to enemy weapons and even supers, why wouldn‚Äôt you use it
---
I miss that gun. I saved my original from day 1. Super bummed they didn't bring it forward
---
bruh you trying to go for a world's first?
---
I feel you man
---
im not talking about fighting lion i was talking about the skyburner lion rampants combo which was a big meme in year 1 crucible
---
You dare say once upon a time in the reef doesn't go hard?
---
The Optimacy armor set is from Eververse. No, it does not count.
---
I mean, why would someone use that in a raid
---
Console player here.... I have no idea what this is. What is traction?
---
Sorry bud but I‚Äôve been playing crucible since vanilla D1
---
That‚Äôs straight gouda
---
I really like the gnawing hunger, but it feels like im shooting an airsoft gun damage wise.
---
This is my favourite meme template
---
I‚Äôve hit the Glimmer cap hundreds of times. Thank the traveler for Spider üôè‚ö™Ô∏èüôè
---
I guess so. Everytime I'm on my last game to fabled (I'm new to the game just started a couple weeks ago) it puts me in a match where it's either a 3v4 or a 2v4 and I keep losing and I was on a five win streak. There matchmaking is shit right now.
---
I believe it expands the search window as the search time continues.  Also remember, there are people in fireteams who have different rankings, so averaging rankings of a team and other factors go into matchmaking outside of simply rank
---
Not sure what you‚Äôre getting at with this. The absolute best players in the game are the ones who created most of these rules and spend a lot of their time in private matches and tournaments. You could give them any loadout and they will still own most of the player base
---
They did it for the starter weapon for D1, so it would be cool to do it again
---
&gt;and I have met actual murderers.
---

---
Hold up
---
Thanks.
---
Lmao funny
---
[Here's another!](https://imgur.com/a/xFN4E71)
---
Thank you.
---
Np!
---
Am I weird than? I‚Äôm a hunter and just wear whatever is best.
---
You should hunt around on youtube for old videos of when the game first came out or old Polygon/Kotaku articles on the game.
---
Speaking of which I need to find a new chest piece when I can, the one I have has terrible perks
---
No you don‚Äôt, as long as you got fabaled this season you‚Äôre good.
---
Then you're clearly not bad
---
Downloading the Battle-net app might give you more options.
---
I use the arcstrider megapunch build with the last man standing, juju, and wendigo and it has essentially infinite add clear and boss melting power.
---
Lmao, its just what i was running for dul incaru so i could have transcendent blessing. my regular armor is way better.
---
String of curses is good on its own but it's like running a rampage gun with no rampage spec, you just don't have time to go from group to group without losing string
---
#NP
---
Back in year 1 it was a great gun, it won't really stand out now.
---
Yes, only one powerful (gold) frame.  The silvers are legendaries and aren't similarly limited.
---
what is Destiny:Forsaken annual pass? it is available for 14.99 and there is also Destiny:Complete collection for 39.99 which is a bit too expensive since i don't know if i would like the game, trying it for the first time
---
Hive Homesystem?! Bring me there now, I'm goddamn ready. I've waited too long.
---
I've heard the leg armor perk "traction" is mandatory for most people who play on console, it improves the feel of aim/movement and sopposedley increases sensitivity to above 10. I haven't tested I prefer PC
---
Cheers, was on 39/40 for the longest time so this felt awfully satisfying.
---
Anytime my man!n  I still love Horror's Least to this day.
---
My buddy mentioned earlier that a bios update that would've fixed it got pushed back last minute by AMD, the fix was originally slated for today, it'll be out soon, probably a last minute fatal error on the bios update that needs to be sorted first.
---
I remember your post a few weeks ago
---
Omg thank you!  So helpful.
---
If someone backs out of the queue last minute the match will start without them.
---
A. Warlocks have Well of Radiance for PvE. That is it. Hunters have the best DPS supers and ad clear supers in Nighthawk and Arc Staff/Tether respectively. Additionally a Hunter punching with Liar‚Äôs Handshake + 1-2 Punch shotgun + Combination Blow out-DPSes literally every Warlock roaming super. Additionally Warlocks are the only class unable to apply a debuff except through Tractor Cannon, while Titans have access to Melting Point and Hunters have Shattering Strike.
---
B. Warlocks have the lowest usage and pickrate in high level PvP currently. Though I will say Contraverse Nova Warp is very fun, Hunters and Titans easily outdo anything a Warlock has. Hunter jump and Spectral/Arc Staff are superior to even the mighty bottom Dawnblade due to that subclass‚Äô lack of a neutral game, and bottom Striker and OEM far surpass anything the Warlock has access to. Additionally the Warlock‚Äôs slow, predictable jump makes them TERRIBLE in sniper duels unless you‚Äôre using top dawnblade, but seeing as your whole plan is ‚Äúuse devour and a shotgun and Recluse‚Äù something tells me that isn‚Äôt exactly in your playbook.
---
Are Warlocks good? Yes.
---
Are they the best PvE class? Possibly, unless DPS is the only thing required.
---
Are they the best, no.
---
All around the best class is objectively Hunter due to their high pickrate in both endgame PvP and PvE activities. Titan, though lacking in PvE, still has a very strong PvP representation.
---
TL:DR, shut up lol
---
That isn't the case at all. All matchmaking sorts first by connection, then in the case of competitive crucible you are matched with players near your glory rank.
---
This is the truth! Preach.
---
When you‚Äôre mad
---
PVE we have dawnblade as well, which can be used for a long as time if using bottom tree and getting ad kills, we also have top tree stormcaller, and then nova bomb and chaos reach for dps. You are probably just a basic ass bitch, and play hunter. Your opinions are irrelevant because you are not a warlock main. So go fuck yourself ;)
---
Just put it in place of Mercury noone will notice. /s
---
All the weapons can drop randomly at the end of games. I believe datto made a video on how to get them other ways
---
Heart of Inmost Light, Wormgod Caress, Insurmountable Skullfort. I‚Äôve used all three and they feel great. Also doom fang Pauldron with sentinel is great. Peregrine Greaves is great as well if your really aggressive. Hallowfire Heart is great too but that‚Äôs mainly PvE.  Synthoceps too, can‚Äôt forget that. Armamenterium is fun too if your running supressors. Antaeus wards are great too if your being sniped.
---
Thank god my clan exists or else I wouldn't have been able to do a single raid
---
Cry some more, ya big baby.
---
#pp
---
Bitch i might cuz shoulder charge fucking hirts.
---
DUNE. MARCHERS. They are fuckin great for running in, punching, and seeing arcs of lightning go in between every enemy.
---
It‚Äôs a bold strategy, Cotton....
---
Damn I forgot those.
---
Yeah but it actually isn't.  first it's called Travelers judgement, and second it's a void energy 3 round burst sidearm
---
I hate when they say synthoceps are good. It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt realize shotguns exist.
---
Drang is also an exotic.
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 14.
---
/r/Fireteams
---
Put the ornaments on the new armor.
---
Any active clans for PS4? I‚Äôm often traveling for work so I‚Äôm as active as I can be.
---
Damn right they are! Yeah! Titans!!! (Titan main here, and also a hammer throwing main as in I mainly use that subclass) but yea I love titans and people really have to fuck off and stop hating on pur power, I mean titans are supposed to be strong bcuz they're the class meant to tank damage and give out big punches n shit like wtf people, grow up. Each character has a specific set of guidelines for how they are in game, like hunters are meant to be weak but fast (or ok not as strong, but very quick moving) and warlocks are meant to be idk, but yea, and titans. Are meant to be fucking tanks. Big hits and big damage resistant but slow moving, I mean cmon
---
No? Drang is a legendary sidearm.
---
Make his minion as a titan.
---
Catch my edit.
---
The titan with the izanagi would like to have a word with big brother.
---
Mabye its solstice gear
---
Sliding then aiming while sliding
---
Big brother aint scared, but brother ain't no bitch. He's also no fucking guardian lol
---
Its kn console too
---
Drink water to activate kill clip.
---
Look, ive shot a lot of things with honed edge. Ive made jaws drop over the sheer volume of damage a precision izanagi honed edge shot does. If he doesnt go in one shot, itll drop before I run outta green. I have a word, that word is Oof.
---
[Oof indeed!](https://cdn.glitch.com/8ef35b11-8c6c-44bb-afb4-a38b833d3c8b%2Foofd.png?1529987683042)

 You have oofed 1278 time(s).

^(I am a bot. Comment ?stop for me to stop responding to your comments.)
---
Sounds like you play destiny, I'm surprised you have any "green" left
---
Fuckin' right?
---
Work is work. At least I have a hobby I enjoy?
---
Lmao same man, same.
---
Luke Smith referred to them as turtles in the D2 gameplay reveal, so I'm gonna go with that
---
Nice
---
That's the thing thoo, I didn't exploit anything that involves giving me an unfair advantage in the game or involves irl money. It also didn't circumvent the ingame economy, only a resource dump.
---
Is it my fault that a loophole (with minor consequences) happens to exist?
---
If they'd issue bans for something like this, I wouldn't even want to play any of their games anymore.
---
If they don't manage to patch this up at launch of the update it's their fault. This could've been discovered by accident by anyone who uses multiple characters in the game.
---
And I *did* earn them. Not the way it was intended, but I still got it. In the same way the menagerie had double drops. The reason why they didn't reroll all earned loot from that is because:
---
* It would be undo-able with all those accounts. It's too much data
---
* They would anger their playerbase who bought the actual season pass and so are directly supporting them
---
All those people also earned "things they cheesed through glitches". And that's just one example.
---
I wish that bungie showed more consistency on matters like this.
---
The least they can do is communicate better about it. They create the content. They made the loophole, it's not the players fault for discovering this and using it. Even if they apologised AND removed the earned rewards it would give a whole other feeling of how the devs think about their players. Communication is key.
---
And yes, they are absolutely entitled to denying service of goods to anyone playing the game, but the way they react to matters like this shows how much a dev team thinks about their playerbase.
---
Welcome to earth, we all have a tale to tell. You'll need a cup of strong tea and a lot of patience if you want to hear mine :P
---
Yes
---
Don't arc hunters have that middle tree uppercut thing? That one shots, right?
---
Cuz I didn‚Äôt wanna go through the hassle of transferring the recording to my phone
---
There was almost nothing in the game yet I played it for like 72 hours at a time. It‚Äôs changed so much
---
Heart of inmost light was a godsend during the grenade kills part in the iron banner quest.
---
If they dont, Kratos walks in and smashes their head against the book
---
I was high af and had just watched the doctor who episode ‚Äòthe impossible planet‚Äô so shush.
---
got one with rapid hit kill clip ricochet rounds but sadly a handling masterwork.
---
seeing all the hate for OEM and i'm still a titan main but i use synthoceps cause i dont want to be a dick that uses OEM
---
Especially that you have to search for your chalice or synthesizer each time because the stuff keeps moving around üôàü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòë
---
I personally think the void would be a great fuckin social space
---
Skyburners oof
---
I would assume we probably won't get one if we haven't gotten one yet, which kinda makes me sad because I wanted to have both Lumina and Thorn.
---
Bug out bag melts thrall instantly, and is solar, so it's good against Hive shields, like Witches and Knights...I always use it in Menagerie with great effect. I'd give it a try if you feel like farming the horrible lands of Reckoning. But at least you'd only need to farm T2...and have to do it the week of Fake Oryx...maybe you're get lucky and get a Spare Rations during the farming!
---
‚ÄúNo one left to fight in your place. So fight!‚Äù
---
still waiting
---
This post upsets me
---
Is there any lore on Sundance? I know she was like cayde but I wouldn't mind reading about her/their relationship. All I've found is our ghosts quote about her.
---
PVP, ‚Äúworking as intended‚Äù üòÇ. 
---
Yes, it does suck. But I try to put a positive spin on it. Yes I am decent, but I will get better playing against better players. If I play against some one at my level, that‚Äôs as equal or slightly worse, then how am I going to get improvements?.
---
Welp. Time to read ALL the lore! :D
---
I'm just Happy that these aren't copped by Insta fags yet.
---
Yes, absolutely, beyond the shadow of a doubt...
---
no absolutely not. for one you hunters don't even have THRUSTERS!
---
Give us thrusters then?!
---
Shit I wish there was more interaction with everyone‚Äôs ghosts. Our ghost talks to everyone but the only other ghost that has spoken to us is sagira
---
Well 1/2 my team are just idiots who cant find their dogs or shoot other people dogs, unable to change up plan based on situations, and loves to keep peaking at the dogs straight on. Just so you know most of them don‚Äôt know the route and path of dogs as well. 
---
As a scale of how bad the team can be, we once was able to 1 phase the boss in spire of stars and the next week it took us 2 days to do it with the same team. We also once got stuck at shuro chi for 2 days as well.
---
So yeah... idiots everywhere lol
---
This has been happening to me a ton recently
---
Give Titans capes like Saladin
---
#NO
---
we took all the thrusters to be epic space knights!
---
you're the sneaky space ninjas and warlocks are the goofy floaty space wizards.
---
Why shouldn't it?
---
Yah that‚Äôs why I thought of it looking through the collections tab and mistaking one for Sundance
---
#HAAAA XD
---
Space ninjas, with a bright shiny glowing stick, or a gun (or a couple knives/bow)
---
It‚Äôs a narrow attack, so can fit through doors, and has no cool down with gamblers dodge, also is already a great movement ability.
---
Not confirmed.
---
But I would want one vs continually upgrading D2. D2‚Äôs base game doesn‚Äôt cut it, D2‚Äôs PvP is a cluster, the expansions were fantastic.
---
Give me a better base game, with a completely revamped PvP experience with the current level of expansions and a more consistent DLC experience, including more robust skill trees.
---
I don‚Äôt care about ‚Äústarting again‚Äù or ‚Äúnot carrying over gear‚Äù.
---
technically you're space ninja-cowboys but yes
---
Sandal the Vandal in the northen region of the EDZ?
---
Maybe a year 3 veterans package?
---
I used to watch that all the time! His son was such a based little shit lol
---
Honestly the first time I was playing forsaken I thought if that immediately when he was introduced "The Rifleman! Starring: Chuck Connor"
---
don't listen to the people who tell you J√∂tunn is a crutch weapon, most of them are DLW runners anyway x'D
---
I mean D1, I found this guy on the moon during a glimmer extraction public event.
---
The one with all of the skiffs.
---
I have always wanted something like this. Here to going well eventually get there.
---
Are you referring to manananggal? Its actually the name of a mythical creature from the Philippines (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manananggal)
---
ohh.

#OH.
---
If you need more space on our Solar System‚Äôs page, you can just remove Gambit, I‚Äôm sure no one will mind.

Anything that lets you track people through walls is by definition broken. Everything else is just icing on the cake.
---
There were a handful of triumphs where progress counted retroactively. I didn't know what they were gonna be, I just logged on and was done with a bunch of em. Yeah you'll get there for sure and I having fun grinding there anyways. If you ever need help on PC, i'm happy to help.
---
OP bought the Complete Collection, not Forsaken. The Forsaken Annual Pass is included in the Complete collection (at least on Xbox it is). The Complete Collection is on sale right now for 39.99 USD.
---
It‚Äôs whatever. The instant I got it and read the damn thing and saw ‚Äúfusion rifle‚Äù I have never even questioned what it was classified as. I guess others aren‚Äôt as bright as me.
---
Drugs are bad mmmmmmkay???
---
You‚Äôre not technically wrong, but you‚Äôre also far from right. Leaver-protection is nothing new, plenty of other games are thoughtful enough to offer features like this that protect players from afks.
---
Bungee offering a quick play feature signals to users that they aren‚Äôt (or shouldn‚Äôt be) expected to build a network of teammates. The feature is already in place.
---
When you bought it, was there a separate code you were given for the Annual Pass?
---
You didn‚Äôt play D1, did you?
---
Kills while you have zone advantage or power plays
---
The more zones you have the more points you get for kills. So one point captured you get 1 point per kill. 2 flags captured you get two points per kill and same thing for 3. But if you have no flags you still get one point
---
sure, but in the Book of Sorrow, it‚Äôs hinted at that Fundament is millions of light years away, so a wrecked exodus ship cruising at what i guess exodus ships could cruise at? not viably possible in the current timeline.
---
One of you have the wrong arm band
---
I see you got very creative with the un-shaded full eververse set
---
This lol
---
How‚Äôd you got expansion I and II for free?
---
Nope, it was a jewel box, paper disc inside with the code... 
---
Only one code, but the box says clearly that it includes the annual pass...
---
Don't really know what's going on...
---
I mean, this has been an issue for what? 1-2 weeks now?
---
The jerky was an issue for what? Over a month?
---
Activision still didn‚Äôt take quite that long (typically). 
---
I get your point though. I suppose it‚Äôs whatever though, thanks,
---
???
---
Then you're playing just for the loot, not the shooting. If you don't wanna grind a fun activity for loot then go play a different game
---
I knew someone would notice..  lol
---
You had me till you mentioned that they aren‚Äôt OP, warlock and hunter supers aren‚Äôt OP but something needs to be done about fist of havoc.
---
Not necessarily, maybe both are adults
---
And may the matchmaking be ever in your favor
---
How about no.
---
What bombs at midnight
---
I‚Äôm on PS, always down to do stuff with a new player. Psn is Paul23G07 if you‚Äôre interested
---
Isnt mercury the flash point this week? That's why things spawn so much.
---
LOL üòÇ hahahaha
---
Me
---
If you played Zero Hour, you can see that it's still under repairs.
---
That was what I had in mind too. In my Guardian Homesystem concept, I had it so that if you clicked on the Hive Homesystem galaxy it would open up a second directory tab
---
Lol, all you're doing is giving them rewards. Now instead of just planetary mats, they also get the reward from you finishing the Forge.
---
**INSTANT** karma
---
You can get a max of 3 per week 1 on each character u get it after killing the final boss riven and there is also a code you can put it once to get one but u can‚Äôt do that weekly
---
*Cammycakes flashbacks*
---
The Iron to Steel shader from IB is pretty good
---
Moon's Haunted.
---
So I gotta ask, are exotics able roll random perks or have they changed that stupid stipulation? I always hated wanting to wear a helmet but seeing it only did stuff for a weapon type I don't like.
---
joj
---
Prodigal mask baron chest and shards of gahlanor
---
Exotic armor from Xur's engram will have random perks, but exotics purchased from him will have whatever perks are shown in this infographic. The perks shown are random from week to week.
---
right. all the casual players who ditched during last season because they didn‚Äôt like gambit or anything relating to it, right?
---
The sentinels of the 5 win streak.
---
So your going out of your way, to intentionally bother people who purposely lower their power level so as to not bother anyone else. You must be really fun at parties....
---
you're still cowboys, I've seen more knights on dragons than cowboys on pegasi
---
Recluse is easy as fuck to get, even for potato aim.
---
I honestly and truly agree with everything. But I just go to suck it up and play on.
---
felt this
---
Nothing warrants a bag.
---
Don't we all
---
You forgot fighting lion I got like 12 in a row in season  1
---
Please let them be ornaments. Love the look of this armour
---
What I'm saying is that ALL pvp feels like Mayhem with all the roaming supers.  The first 2 minutes are fun then after that it's super after super and they last way too long.
---
Now a days we are way above the power level of LW. Tbh the heroic flawless menagerie triumphs are probably the most difficult content in the game right now. Getting killed in a well of radiance?? Like damn
---
second one is üëå
---
Wasnt saying OEM and striker arent easy, they are my toddler could do it what I was saying is that nothing is particularly hard it's all pretty easy
---
All PVP feels like Mayhem with super chaining nonstop is what I'm saying.
---
Hi Titan, I'm guessing I called you out.
---
All PVP is literally mayhem at the moment except for the first 2 minutes.  It's unbelievable how heavy ammo spawns every second.
---
You mean falling.
---
Thanks guys! I mainly want to focus on the eggs, and seems like The Shattered Throne is the only place that happens during curse week, so I'll try and knock those out. I've been doing the platforms every week so far, those are easy enough. That's the hidden chests your speaking of, right?
---
I think snapshot is a must, regardless of roll
---
I want a redemption arc where shiro-4 finds and trains uldren to be a hunter in secret
---
Holy shit. That‚Äôs all I can say üëçüèª
---
Ya you can‚Äôt really farm them they just naturally come from playing the game. I feel raids are the best because it‚Äôs the best way of getting curated weapons that are fully masterworked so when you dismantle them you get 7 cores
---
?
---
Banshee bounties every day. EVERY day. Start stocking up now. Also if you get ‚Äúfinest matterweaves‚Äù always make sure to use them.
---
Ok thanks I‚Äôm super new so any advice helps :)
---
What are banshee bounties? Again, I‚Äôm a super noob
---
Then don‚Äôt play with randoms! Build your own team! Why are you complaining about it here? That‚Äôs not going to stop anything so this post is just a waste of time.
---
If you are seriously working on leveling up, get a team, don‚Äôt rely on random teammates to get it done.
---
People leave comp in games all the time, this isn‚Äôt new...
---
Holy fuck
---
Hoon's maunted
---
I know you tried but "enrico" is neither a word or name.
---
It‚Äôs the other way around. Most Jotunn deaths are avoidable so they‚Äôre trash for dying to it. Bold using maul in comp tho
---
They are the bounties offered by the gunsmith in the tower. Once you land at the tower he is just off to the right side of where you spawn. He has 4 or 5 you can do every day and it‚Äôs just like ‚Äúget x kills with y weapon‚Äù
---
To go see Banshee in the tower. He‚Äôs in between Shaxx and Rahool in the main upper area. He has bounties that award enhancement cores. 3 dailies and 2 weeklies.
---
Yup that also works
---
That‚Äôs correct. You‚Äôd need to be at 1980 for the weekly bonus to push you up to fabled‚Äîassuming you‚Äôve played three games this week already. As someone who just reached Fabled last night after a series of back-and-forth matches, good luck!
---
Awesome! Thanks so much.
---
It has extremely high damage resistance, regenerates super energy on kills, and lasts fucking forever.
---
What do you think the best is, then, if bottom tree striker is "average"?
---
It sounds like you just liked year one of destiny alot
---
Me too... me too...
---
Link to buy the shirt.
---
This was my friends, I think it's all caluses selected and caluses treasured for helmet
---
MONSTERCAT AND SHAQ?!?! WAT?
---
People can go from 360 No Scoping to potato aim in the same firefight lmao.
---
If you wanna play destiny,absolutely go for it.
---
Forsaken is the best expansion this game has ever seen
---
Lol the dude from New Monarchy looks just like Gene Hackman in The Royal Tenenbaums
---
Thanks I'll try looking it up. Won't get banned tho right?
---
No. It is not an illegal think to do.
---
Old meme
---
But wouldn't it be considered boosting?
---
Some of these characters are already super old anyways, so it‚Äôs kind of redundant
---
What ‚Äúsense‚Äù?
---
You are complaining about issues that only affect solo players. Competitive is a team game. Any team has an advantage over solos because of communication.
---
That makes sense to me. If ‚Äúsense‚Äù to you means that any player should be able to solo queue and never have any issues whatsoever? Then yeah, you aren‚Äôt going to convince me of that. You SHOULD have a disadvantage as a solo player.
---
I would love to get those pinnacle weapons, but sadly i dont have a fireteam and im not doing it with randoms lol. Thank you for the suggestions though. Also, do we know when the next iron banner is, and will l still be able to get this swarm of the raven?
---
But it is
---
With the way OEM Titans get trashed around here I'd beg to differ
---
I love it when a Titan who panic pops fists of havoc teabags.
---
On Tuesday,and look for swarm with spike grenades perk,it's what makes this weapon really powerful
---
"F... F-"
---
What about the eliksni home world
---
I personally have not looked it up, but my clan admin (who I might add is crazy good at this game) he says it's not illegal. I'd delete all evidence this convo happened tho. It's not something to advertise.
---
Most likely referring to where the titan landed when he died.
---
#FIGHT FOREVER GUARDIAN

Ok i will too, is there a video about it?
---
I'm sure there is. Goodbye u/Mcdave37 and good luck.

When the joke was funny they were frew upvotes all around - I didn't mind giving then out....

Now the people who overuse it get free downvotes :)

Thank you!

Damn, that lack of punctuation was brutal.

Solid work bro.
---
Broke 2 rules in a single post.
---
Rule 13 - no loot/achievement posts
---
Rule 14 - all screenshots must be direct capture.
---
I swear it‚Äôs like you all actively avoid reading the rules around here.
---
I‚Äôve been booted 3-4 hours into the farm and I‚Äôm at 400 light, how do you keep it going without getting kicked somehow?
---
They should be our first taste of Armor 2.0 but that‚Äôs a long stretch since,  by the sounds of that Polygon story, they‚Äôre still working on it.
---

Idk how to embed a link so hopefully that's good enough. In short here are the steps:
---
Head over to the¬†Tribute Hall¬†using the first character.
---
Get the bounty being offered by the statue and complete it.
---
After completion, players will then be offered a banner.
---
Instead of placing the banner right away, go to a second character and pick up the abandoned quest and let the second character do it
---
.Head back to orbit, return to the Tribute hall and place the banner down again.
---
Keep doing this till you get to 18 and you get the bad juju

Geez üòÇ that‚Äôs so brutal but I understand it though. LoW is broken but at the same time it feels so nice to use it because I used it just as much I do now in D1. But I will agree I and everyone else does deserve a teabag when they get killed after using LoW. At the moment it‚Äôs just too OP

I started on the ps4. Got it for free with ps+. I barely survived the first few missions mostly because shooter and consoles don't work for me. But I liked the concept and a friend recommended it especially the story of forsaken so I got it for pc. I'm now the proud owner of a 730 titan

Iron Banner doesn't count. Are you sure you reached Glory rank Fabled, in Competitive? 5500 points or thereabouts, I'm not sure about the lower bracket.
---
I got Colony today. First drop and I'm 731.

You can only get 4 boons per day. It's actually stated on the Bounty itself.
---
You can claim four rewards per day.

You're supposed to get to Legend, whereas Recluse only requires Fabled. I said Fabled there due to muscle memory, apologies. But yeah, Fabled I is 2100, that's not even the halfway point for Legend.
