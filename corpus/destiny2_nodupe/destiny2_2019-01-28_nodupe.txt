Happened to me too, it will stay for almost anything except restarting the game
---
---
---
Prolly waiting for whisper
---
Ohhhhhh. Awesome! I appreciate the info
---
Yikes...
---
This.  That said, I am okay with a game that rewards you for having a measure of social skill, right?
---
Down voted because im currently bored with destiny. 
---
Choosing each piece is good, I'm just talking about removing cost (shards/bright dust) or maybe just make everything for glimmer like the rares.
---
This right here. I don't think people fully grasp just how much of a threat the invader is. Invasions are not a minor nuisance, they're the biggest factor in determining the outcome of a game, more than the NPCs, more than the blockers, and more than the Primeval itself.  
---

---
My solo Gambit experience has improved vastly ever since I started bringing a Queenbreaker along; not to invade, but to counter invaders. It's tricky, but being able to defang the other team (and earn three free motes for the kill) makes winning substantially easier.
---
Does that work in grinding your way up to fable and would it be possible to reach it doing that before the season ends?
---
Nice, Luck of the draw I guess!
---
Regular price. Sales probably won‚Äôt be around this time, maybe last half of year tho.
---
God bless
---
I deleted it after the quest step was done. You don't need to keep it.
---
Except it is, what I stated are the biggest problems that are happening, Xbox couldn‚Äôt even play until the second day 
---
If you go into Details it has a lore entry you can read. 
---
I guess you could say she was taken by Oryx 
---
oh wow, 70 is reg price.  psn store says reg is 100 for forsaken + annual pass
---
For the last four weeks, I have gotten only Y1 exotics a day before they‚Äôre available at Xur.  Only one roll was better than those available at Xur...
---
Thanks
---
BOOOOOOOOOONE?
---
Problem is the tracking isnt as mad lad crazy as you think. Staffing to the sides can cause it to miss. It is still devastating to the unsuspecting blueberry clearing adds though...
---
Oh nice, a demon of hell
---
Oh yah. I was just naming the thing I hated the most out of every class. I chose bb over spectral blades cause it literally takes no skill and you can panic it out. 
---
Then you meet with thunderlord or quenbreaker
---
Destiny players are shit. They love to quit everything the minute anything gets hard. 
---
I disagree, got my Luna‚Äôs solo 
---
I‚Äôm not alone! 
---
What is this step? I just started grinding for it and I‚Äôm scared 
---
Got all except fookin Sleeper!
---
Eh it wasn't that bad when it worked it was actually quite enjoyable I'd prefer to put up with its bugs then deal with the bullshit that is comp. 
---
Literally happened to me a couple hours ago. I was carrying this 3 stack of warlocks, I had 39 Elims and the bottom guy had 8. We won by like 15. At the end I didn‚Äôt emote or anything cause their titan was really good player and was held back by his team. The bottom frag warlock teabagged the titan down the throat. 
---
You must construct additional pylons...
---
"\*Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same\*"
---
\-that titan
---
I've had that happen before and it was there for like 2 hours cuz I didn't feel like restarting my game
---
What‚Äôs a a wavesplitter /s. üò©
---
impact font
---
How does it drop?
---
Yeah, sucks but it's better than grinding gambit.
---
üòÇüòÇ Pretty spot on. 100 pts less on raid nights!
---
Same! Along with a bunch of other lore things and my ramen coupon #RIPCayde
---
Yep that too
---
happens to me all the time :( FeelsBadMan
---
That pasta was never funny, and it's completely out of place here. Back to fortnite kiddo. 
---
Its currently season 5 and I have reset my valor 5 times. however when i finally unlocked the quest step it is not check marked. I even have the triumph showing i reset 5 times in a single season. Help
---
The Gensym scribe cloak with perks would be amazing. 
---
Less impact damage, more explosive damage. Also it will kill you as well. 
---
I really love this and just thought about rewatching it today. And just like last time I was wondering which Soundtrack this is, because I'm not all that familiar with all the tracks there are.. so if you could tell me which it is, I'd highly appreciate it :)
---
Yeah, that ones decent, I also like the O.G. crucible cloak, that one is pretty nice. It reminds me of the AOS Cryptid cloak which is easily my all time favorite destiny cloak. 
---
Maybe check light.gg
---
haha yeah 
---
Probably would just quit right now. Anthem or something might be better. I‚Äôm really into MM right now. Thad Mickey Mousecadades. Toughest game you‚Äôll ever play. 
---
We have fixed comp. - Bungie probably.
---
Reminds me of the OA.
---
The changes roll in on the 29th. The changes are the damage caused by the super are more dependent on the explosion after wards instead of the direct impact of them
---
I guess Ill do that. Just enjoy grinding until they hopefully announce another destiny, if ever.
---
You can earn all of the exotics through lucky drops and Xur (weekly vendor). If it‚Äôs the one you get on Titan, it doesn‚Äôt take too long to get back to that point if you did want to restart. Probably faster than hoping it drops. 
---
Gamer tag is the same as my screen name, I need to run it for izanagis burden
---
Honestly it looks like the hunter and the cabal in the middle of a break dance contest.
---
It's a stabilizer. Most compound bows will have one, helps keep balance on big draw bows
---
The hunter and warlock have an interesting conversation at a booth. The titan shoulder charges his way through the bartender.
---
He‚Äôs a vendor who comes on the weekend selling an exotic for each class and 1 weapon, and an engram that drops a random y1 exotic you don‚Äôt own yet. His location varies but he shows up on the Friday reset, at which point you can just google ‚Äúwhere is Xur‚Äù to figure out where he is
---
Never mind, ya figured it out!
---
Xur is an NPC who spawns Friday through Monday who sells a class specific exotic and an exotic weapon. He also sells an Engram which will give you a non-Forsaken exotic that you don‚Äôt have yet for your class. 
---
BWAAAAAAN BAAAAAAAA DAH DAHH DUUUUUUUH DUUUUUUUUH!!!!!!!!
---
You spell Metro Shift weird
---
Great, but where does he spawn ?
---
Jesus H......üò≥üò≥üò≥
---
Hey i was just thinking about that video yesterday. 
---
I guess he's a hard guy to forget. XD
---
so, it's hard to explain cause there's never been a full fledged explanation on why that works but basically
---
Awoken = light + darkness
---
Taken Awoken = light + (darkness√ó2)
---
Saved awoken = (light√ó2) + (darkness√ó2)
---
I just don't see the point in spending another $70 for it since i'm a solo player so I cant do the raids or any of the other fun stuff. I used to love doing raids on Destiny 1 but even then it was hard because I had to keep searching for groups
---
so at the end of The Corrupted she is lightx2+darkness+1= wtffff lol
---
Fucking hate Comp!!!!‚Äô
---
And I can't shake it off
---
What platform you play on? 
---
what... no
---
shes twice the darkness and twice the light
---
I'm guessing somewhere my android phones keyboard options got lost in translation to another phone or to a browser
---
‚ÄúDefeat the enemies of humanity.‚Äù Any PVE activities, I‚Äôm assuming. 
---
PC
---
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHH........
---
..... TUUUUUUUN TUUUUUUUUUUUNN 
---
Nope, year one. Forsaken exotics bare the symbol on the top right corner of the item icon.
---
Oh no, I actually base my opinion of developers on my experiences with them, instead of groupthink and woo. and now some totally random person on the Internet thinks I'm "the biggest loser possible". How terrible. How awful.
---
At least I'm not a blind fanboi swilling at the Koolaid - like you.
---
Yea but I already have it
---
I'm guessing you never played laser tag or dodgeball modes.
---
Pulses were the worst back in year 1.
---
It's just the nature of the game.
---
Fits perfectly 
---
I didn't know my Ghost was a tart but twice over? damn
---
I would might not had went into a murderous rampage across the tangled shore, if this Zavala said not to.
---
Rifts feel perfectly fine to me, but this would be a neat concept for an exotic. 
---
Wow. So that really pissed you off huh?
---
Maybe you shouldn't take A GAME so seriously kid. When you really have grown up, you'll see that I'm right. Until then, lol.
---
Are the forges any good?
---
I don't think Bungie has anything to worry about, lol.
---
That reminds me, Bungie, when are we getting NLB as a returning exotic?
---
That's 100% accurate 
---
I recommend Malfeasance
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Upcoming game that is similar to Destiny and Warframe.
---
Ugh. Flashbacks of the Invincible Nightmare...
---
i dont see anything bad
---
If your choosing not to do the forges that is your problem. I have done all the forges, got to 650 and got lunas this season almost entirely by myself. If your choosing not to do the forges to try to get things like le monarch and jotunn that is your loss. U obviously dont understand that the "crucible team" can not just push out updates without an ok from higher ups. Also, you made up that militias birthright is getting nerfed and grenade launchers do not have a range stat so mountain top can one hit kill on a direct hit from any range. Not to say that it wouldn't be hard but it can be done. Also like I said before jotunn only one hit kills on direct hits. The tracking on the gun is not very strong at long ranges so if you just move out of the way it doesn't kill you. You dont need to try to belittle me by saying that I dont understand that there is different teams that work on different things. Bungie has stated even in this week at bungie last week that there goal is "to avoid pvp adjustments that will negatively affect pve efficacy". I have already said this a couple of times. Guess what if we are being totally honest the game and updates cannot be 100% catered to only pvp players when the majority of the playerbase is in pve or a mix of the 2. If you aren't going to realise that this conversation is over. Also d2 has 24 maps and 5 are from d1 so you dont have to be an asshole about remastering maps.
---
You can‚Äôt really 
---
Then Nerf it in pvp
---
That's just sad. No wonder why pay-to-win/microtrandactions work, because people pay over $200 for one weapon.
---
Yes getting 2 bursted across the map feel balanced 
---
I play worlock
---
They should be in between autos and scouts, not above scouts and a faster ttk then autos
---
Looks great! Where did you get them?
---
You could try looking in /r/fireteams or /r/FireteamsPS4 as well. 
---
Fair point, but EA are famous for their antics
---
3D printed them all out, it‚Äôs super fun
---
Hadn‚Äôt tried Coldheart.  Thanks for the tip!  Looks good.
---
Can you share a link to the files? I'd love to try and print them myself!
---
But you can on a grenade launcherüòâ
---
I do alternate that with wavesplitter but trace rifles are really good in general. They melt from a safer distance than a shotty and have great ammo economy. 
---
Definitely not gambit-specific. I got it way before forsaken 
---
Blueberries passed the rank of 1800 and are solo are üëåüèª. (Ps4 BTW) got my luna last season solo and Mountaintop this season. Blueberries are more dependable than teammates in my experience. Mostly. 
---
Thanks!
---
I do have a few speed demon ghosts, but I've sort of transcended to only guiding light or activity specific xp boosting ghosts. 
---
I wouldn't call this desperation, just end-game persnickiocity. 
---
(Side note, I just bought 2 in a row while typing this post and of course one has the preloader.)
---
Party. 
---
Eyyyyyyyy let's go. Time to approach infinity, with no transmat time üëå
---
Well, it's a hand cannon, soooo.1
---
‚Ñí‚Ñ¥‚Ñì this reminds me of when the greybeards shout at u in skyrim
---
yea its a small trick to change the smal balls to the traveler.
---
Quite. 
---
To [the vicinity of] infinity and thereabouts!
---
üòé
---
HEAR WHAT?!?!?! HUH!?!?! SCRIMMAGES!?!!?!?! GAAH MY HEAD!!!!!!!!!
---
The problem is that they win every fight, close range, medium range, and long range. Like have you played pvp? In comp I play with a 4 stack not forgotten team and we lose to teams who all out in pulses and telestos. Like pulses should require skill and be more punishing to use.
---
I think, maybe....? It's been a few months.
---
Add me to noob list. Tourette
---
How does it feel when your protoplasm us dumb as shit and just plain wrong.
---
Looks cool af congrats 
---
The problem is that they win every primary fight in all ranges. 
---
Try trust. It helped me tons. I am still working on situational awareness but ace is in my inventory
---
Here's where it becomes hazy. Sure, Ade barrage is op. But it is THE ONLY SUPER THAT CAN KILL OTHER SUPERS. GOLDEN GUN REQUIRES A MINIMUM OF 2 SHOTS TO KILL A NOVA WARO WARLOCK, FIST OF HAVOCK TITAN ETC. WHY CAN WE NOT BALANCE THIS 5 YEAR OLD GAME SYSTEM? ARE THESE DEVELOPERS THAT FUCKING STUPID?
---
Is this how you get rid of error code Guitar?
---
Her cute lil drawl and soft voice. ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Thanks! 
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox so no wavesplitter for me 
---
Did any of your teammates rage in chat, inventing whole new thesaurus pages around the word ‚Äòuseless‚Äô and recommending you all do to yourselves things that violate the Geneva Convention?
---
The experience isn‚Äôt complete without that.
---
It works really well too. Whit the poison arrows.you have to time the shot a little better than the other bow classes. But when you get a perfect draw. It's good. Have a nice day 
---
Pity Chaos Reach is Warlock-only.
---
Duplicate drops are a problem too. My friend got 3 sunbracers within a month.
---
Oh my godddd
---
Yes I've played PvP, and I agree Bygones is a very strong weapon, My curated one has 2.5k Crucible kills on it and I prefer to use it over my Lunas as it is more versatile, I think the problem is the playstyle, A lunas will put up a fight with Bygones in a 1v1 but in a team based game its just not as viable, Bygones provides support from most ranges and being a pulse rifle, it can team shot a lot more reliably than a Hand Cannon, Believe me, If you want to beat a Bygones user, Single them out and make their life a living hell, You see them in a fight cuddled up in their team? Go around and pop your shots into them, Don't need to win the fight, don't need to kill them, Bygones is a 3 burst kill and the Bursts take longer to fire than a Lunas does to fire 3 bullets, there should be no reason to lose the fight if you both hit your shots, I understand the frustration of the weapon being easy to use and not punishing but that's just how the game is going to work, Destiny doesn't reward skill as highly as some other games do, and sometimes you've just got to deal with that.
---
Only when the other team is very coordinated and good at what they are doing  lol
---
Wrong üòÇ
---
This is in comp
---
It just sucks so hard when you lose by 1 and 1 cap can literally win the game
---
Oh I know that's generally why I avoid crucible unless it's with friends
---
I do too usually, but im 100 points off lunas and no one else is on. I felt spicy but now im ripperino
---
so... i could go for a win streak in there.
---
Ada1's love is finite, Shaxx is forever!
---
Oh well then. Sad but not unusual
---
Unfortunately 
---
it ok&lt;3
---
Gz on both of em. 
---
I just read about the changes to the redrix quest and with me being a pvp scrub who grinded his ass off for 5 resets this season, it kinda breaks my heart. Too bad the gun imo sucks and I hate only relying on a single perk. Plus, the aim is shit compared to my bygones. Even with stab mw and target corrector this gun kinda seems hard to control (might be only for pros). 
---
Never expected to see that show mentioned here lol
---
Thank you very much
---
Okay thanks! 
---
It's fun starting with Lunas first, (especially with breakneck) then when summoning the prime switch to geo.
---
The father's hip with the sjw crowd.
---
common sense seems to be missing within Gambit, so many bad players 
---
I feel you man, i litterly got shards as a random drop in a strike.
---
Fair balance IMO would be limiting to 1 exotic only during PVP. 
---
Charge your phone mate. And stop using the 12 hour clock, it looks weird.
---
and of course Nova Warp gets a genuine small nerf while BB gets nerfed into oblivion
---
I've had the same question. Would it be possible to do something like the morgeth bridge skip? Where if two reliable people make it through you could join back up after going to orbit? 
---
Got it from a chest in last wish. I now have 2 650 thunderlord. Why is it in the pool once you already have it ? :/
---
on the other hand: Headshots in any PvE run is pretty easy. So using it on daily heroes/Strikes quest will fill that rapidly...
---
We though we should go to round 3, the other team wasn't even trying 
---
Yeah, the distribution in destiny 2 sadly allows for a lot of poistive/negative streaks, given the low amount of chances/sources. Most other games are equally as bad, but you simply feel a negative streak a lot less when you have several "tries" per day (farming a boss for example) in another game, compared to having the same amount of tries per week (powerful gear and other, higher chances) only.
---
We have a good example in our clan; A friend basically barely gets exotic stuff at all, while every time we run raids and stuff with him everyone else gets curated drops and exotics lol.
---
I've seen a handful of vids of that going very well for the invader. Other times, a linear fusion rifle or thunderlord makes short work of them. 
---
I thought Myelin Games explained it long time ago. Like the vex cannot simulate the light, the darkness cannot just take a creature of light. However light can be corrupted and turned into darkness. Besides I am pretty sure that taking a guardian would result in him losing his light, which would make the effort useless. A taken Enemy is supposed to fight for the one who took.
---
They probs just gave up seeing how good you were first round üòÇ 
---
I did that with chaos reach a couple times. Jump up to get a better view when chasing someone, LOW DOOR FRAME HOPE YOU DIDNT LIKE HITTING ANYTHING 
---
Old news 
---
Did it acutally count them correctly for you?
---
I got the emblem a while back and counted the "motes deposited" per round, with the result being 114 after 3 rounds.. only to have the game show me 102 in the end. Which made absolutely no sense. Still got the emblem luckily :/
---
The ppl in my team were ult spamming like crazy, i wasn't able to pick up around 30 motes because of how fast they were killing stuff. But it was a lot of fun, 
---
If you‚Äôre looking to run through a second character, don‚Äôt dismantle all weapons when you‚Äôre done with them (eg once the power level gets superseded). Chuck them into your vault. 
---
Which brings me nicely onto...
---
Get an App to manage your gear. The official Destiny Companion/Ishtar/Destiny Item Manager etc. They all allow you to move items from your character to others, or the vault. They‚Äôre vital at saving you time throughout the game.
---
Melting pointed the bastard after we killed the wizards. Popped hammers, threw ONE hammer and got booped into a wall and died. 
---
&gt;crappy catalyst.
---
Either you don't *have* the catalyst, or you're just a troll. 
---
Crimson's catalyst is one of the best in the game. 
---
Was one wearing Geomags? Aye at least you had fun, I just hate gambit when going for Malfeasance tbh 
---
I feel the same way about the Fists of Havoc update on bottom tree Striker, it will last forever as long as there are enemies around. 
---
My man Hiraks got a big tiddy Hive gf
---
They are decent. But not optimal.
---
For example i could run tatara gaze with kill clip and one tap body shot from hip. That would be even crazier than getting 3 bursted by bygones.
---
There will always be a "meta" and we as a players must show our ability to adapt.
---
#RAINBOWSIEGEORIGINALMEMES
---
I hardly play gambit but my friend couldn't do malfeasance strike without me and I didn't want to do it until I got it.
---
Few games into curseweek, boss spawns, we get by with just a nut hair finish and then a few games after he spawns and we ended up getting everything but the emblem, it was a good week.
---
Malpractice is fun too.
---
Mostly solo player here. I got to 650 on my first character after about a month. I feel like I got the most increase doing Dreaming City stuff. Blind Well, Ascendant Challenge, and bounties. The forges have been good to me, even though the quests to open them can be tedious. Nightfalls are pretty easy to solo. I don't do big points runs but having a singe and heavyweight makes them very doable for the basic power engram. Raids? I got nothing for you. I mainly only get to play late at night after my kids are out. It can be done, just not as easy as others have it. 
---
You can reach level 650 with a lot of PvP and PvE gaming, without doing any raid but you need to do a lot of grinding. I'm a level 650 Titan and I never done a raid, but i did a lot of Dream City weekly quests, crucible and gambit bounties, etc. But yeah, as others mentioned you can find a clan/fireteam pretty easy.
---
Happy Cakeday fellow Lightbearer, be careful so that you don‚Äôt punch your cake
---
I got mine from a public event that was about to end but I was kind of far so I just shot an enemy to join it and then it dropped LOL
---
[What ? ](https://youtu.be/DFfIWws4lfs) 
---
Aye
---
I really want to kill Fikrul, but... it‚Äôs just not possible...he‚Äôs worse than SCP-692 or SCP-173
---
Well I‚Äôm stupid 
---
Which armor set is that? I know the helmet, and the legs probably black forge but what about the rest?
---
my hero
---
Sorry but that appears to be the wrong link it's too quiet, this is the right one. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytjYdJWYQ6Y
---
those look really nice, what program do you use for the design
---
Baeda-1
---
Nah but panic barrage+galanor is one button for free team wipes that you can do back to back to back to- you get it
---
#Towering waves of cruel fate.
---
Which is really funny when you consider that Bungie is technically the architects.
---
Is that y1 armor I see?
---
One-Eyed Mask spotted.
---
Leveling up is a lot faster if you've already got a high level character. Just buying the good guns out of collections for resources and legendary shards is way easier than infusing. 
---
Yeah I know no shader could make the Ancient Apocalypse Mock Turtleneck look that cool. 
---
Need dat perk tho...
---
In my experience the Crucible is pretty great to level up.
---
Oo never tried trace rifles! Will try out prom lens next time
---
I feel like there are fewer people in comp every day and even tho my glory keeps dropping the teams I face just get sweatier and sweatier 
---
Getting a[Worker of Secrets](https://infinityblade.fandom.com/wiki/Worker_of_Secrets) vibe from Infinity Blade II/III
---
That‚Äôs not just on Xbox. People haven‚Äôt used supers invading in general since linear fusions became the preferred approach. 
---
Lots of people are having trouble finishing that one off. 
---
&gt; I tried the Anthem demo this weekend and that‚Äôs honestly what made me break out D2 again.
---
So how bad is the demo?  I haven‚Äôt been able to try it yet since I don‚Äôt have access to the closed beta, but from the videos I‚Äôve seen it looks hopelessly generic.  Not a good sign that their demo made you want to play Destiny lol.
---
It's still really good, but it's probably a better fit for one of the chunkier frames in warframe
---
Am i going crazy but who the hell was the announcer for that, was that efrideet
---
1 I only played Alone as a god (kinetic weapon)
---
SNAPSHOT is the most important. Also a lot of handling is nice to have. 
---
2 puh not really... but they will get buffed anyways (2 tap on body) there are some good rapid fife sniper: supremacy, alone as a good, the long goodbye, twilight oath
---
3 Never peak more than twice (enemies will prefire and wont stop shooting üòÇ)  learn to know where your enemies come from. Play for a while spectral blades and crouchshot your first shot. Wallhack is insane and you will get a feeling where enemies come from üòâ
---
Thanks alot!!
---
100% agree. People expect an exotic; a new one at that - every single day from a strike or something 
---
The term Exotic denotes its rarity,  perfect reasoning. 
---
Salvation Army, thank you.
---
I agree completely 
---
[whereisxur.com](https://whereisxur.com), [wherethefuckisxur.com](https://wherethefuckisxur.com) are good if you need info on where he is or what he's selling.
---
Buy the stuff he is selling if you don't have it already because the fated engram will give you a random year 1 exotic that you don't already own, and it would suck to pay 97 shards for the engram and have it drop the weapon or armor piece he's selling for for 23 shards. The fated engram will only drop weapons or armor for the class you buy the engram with.
---
And yet... My guardian can't hold back a bow for longer than couple seconds
---
Yeah you can easily get a couple slashes off before they register and hold it long enough to get a kill 
---
Thanks man
---
Change this to gambit and malfeasance and you have my fucking life
---
You can't hit 70k
---
64,300 or so is the max,  I'm sitting around 62,250 or so. 
---
Got Wayfarer,  Dredgen,  Cursebreaker,  will finish Chronicler as Truth To Power finishes and I'm only a few off Rivensbane and Blacksmith! 
---
Each level is fairly minor but it adds up. 
---
It‚Äôs 1% per level of both the specified elemental resistance and general damage resistance while in your super. 
---
Once you have each armour piece levelled that‚Äôs 5% of each per piece for potential 25% damage reductions (though most would run an exotic armour piece so only 20% really). 
---
His pee pee is dripping. 
---
That makes me feel a little better. I suck at crucible, but I love gambit. Crucible‚Äôs rumble and competitive playlist, lower my self esteem most of the time, LOL. 
---
Boy looks like he's about to mantle the Numidium
---
Nope. 
---
Destiny is turning into a telltales game *ada will remember that*
---
And othersides engram looks different,  no glow no electricity no light pillar 
---
This type of armour for curse would've been amazing
---
*Like some ancient Egyptian warrior god pharoh vibe* üíØüíØüíØ
---
Yes plz bungie get this guy under your belt.
---
Its because of how shit the meta is its not worth playing PvP, but they still want powerful gear
---
Malfeasance is cool as shit but IMO Sunshot looks cooler. It looks like a handheld railgun.
---
All these videos that get posted of someone destroying a clearly disabled team. 
---
The game is just giving you a finger, it took me tons of saboteur/forge weapons and some of then nice rolls too to get that refurbished black armory shader
---
You'll get there buddy.
---
Took me 18 on the dot. 
---
Well, there's a good reason people stopped using it. 2 shots to kill another super (or 3 depending on the circumstances), the time is extremely short so people can hide and wait 6 seconds for it to run out. And you don't get any damage resistance. 
---
This is that part of D2 I hated. People sitting on each other's D***
---
It was the envoy of the nine.  She did the trials matches.
---
Mostly because development costs have gone up. As technology has progressed to the point where it can handle more polygons, higher-resolution textures, more complex animations and more complex particle effects and lighting, the time and effort it takes to create each of those things in a quality consistent with AAA games has also gone up, which makes some games cost many millions of dollars to make. So sometimes a $60 pricetag isn't enough to recoup those costs.
---
Of course, this isn't a black and white topic, some companies can make a phenomenal, top quality game and still make things worth with only a $60 pricetag, although the only example I can think of is The Witcher 3. And sometimes the extent to which companies try to peddle microtransactions and DLC is straight up predatory. But most games land in the middle, where they're not trying to be purposefully harmful to their consumers but they can't make ends meet for only $60 per player.
---
My thoughts exactly
---
NP, best hit him up before he disappears at reset tomorrow and get that gear if you don't already have it!
---
For the most part the purification rituals aren't that difficult with the rd armour. Heck I can do them solo,that should tell you something 
---
Same
---
What makes u say that?
---
Also Taken Goblins. Those bastards are another pain in the ass with their stupid immunity shield on troublesome enemies.
---
Gwisin fix was technically a nerf if you look at the numbers only. Used to give a ton more super on right click even after the original kill was long used up.
---
Yes he should sell them. Old exotics are gay. Like this post.
---
Nah those hunter and warlocks can go nova warp or spectral blades somewhere else, it‚Äôs a Titan‚Äôs time to shine! üò§ #TitanMain

Man I miss this game 
---
You  should‚Äôve thrown more grenades
---
You know you can get rid of those by just deleting them
---
I saw post where a guy said the whole game dlc and all was on sale for 70$ annual pass too I'm sure.
---
It being sold stand alone on sale anytime soon doesn't seem to promising, atleast from what I gathered anyway
---
Damn. I can tell how comfortable you are with six shot GG. Even I‚Äôm gonna give it a chance tomorrow. With a good hand you could probably have some crazy ad clear!
---
You still gotta pick up heavy to make use of it. Wave and tel ya get free ammo
---
Also its much more satisfying to get them yourself
---
sick
---
I'm late to the party, just hit lvl 50 a couple days ago. First thing I did was upgrade my Sunshot to 500. So satisfying to be able to blap shit with it again. Sunshot is love, Sunshot is life.
---
Go for it. Great ammo economy and can melt at a much safer range than a shotty. I change between all 3 of them but main cold heart. Can‚Äôt wait for a legendary trace... someday.

What me and the clan do is 2 chaos with geos, 1 tether and riggs, and 1 blade barrage with shards. Tether gets the witches and all the ads together and we just kill them normally. This makes a shit ton of orbs and gets us to x2 instantly, after that everyone melts and if we have to do it again orbs are plentiful

dual wielding sidearms in crucible
---
Yes
---
I dont think I have more patience with this mess. The game feels less and less rewarding. Not even one of these forged weapons had a damage perk like rampage or something like that. 100% pure crap loot for an entire week of grind. No shader, no armor and no weapon worth keeping.

Destiny has so many different designs and themes of armour and in the story in the game but this one is a know because it looks too different? What?

sexyyyy

Looks like a similar setup as seen in this video:

Same happens to 1k Voices iirc

YES PLEASE!

That‚Äôs not even the issue at hand though. 
---
He‚Äôs complaining about the boss stomps launching him through his own teams portal.
---
And that‚Äôs gonna be up as long as no one Invades the enemy 
---
OEM being rare does not justify its strength. 
---
Sunshot would be the best handcannon on console if the recoil wasn‚Äôt dumb dumb
---
Gambit is total crap and if the next season is focused on it I‚Äôm 100% putting this game down.
---
Give it like a ethereal glow in the seems and then we're talking raid worth
---
Are you stupid lol, literally looks like Trials of Osiris set 
---
Yea you deposit enough to get to 74 notes then bank a 15. I believe max possible tp bank is 267.

So go play it

Nah mate thats just because he went to ancient vex timelines and got the best Loincloth in the know universes
---
But when we pop nova bomb ;) 
---
Yes and no. I know what he is saying. But if you pop
---
Your super u may be up in the air and an easier curb stomp into the portal and now u don‚Äôt have your super for boss DPS. I know what he is saying, and how it works, I was adding a little levity... sheesh. 
---
Lol
---
What can you expect from rng, the best thing you can do is just take a breather or play another game and comeback when you have that bit of fire in you.
---
The shaders will always be there to grind for when you comeback to it.
---
Need 1 rare bounty for blacksmith, sparrow and flawless lw for rivensbane, ghost for cursebreaker
---
know about 70k but on some day I hope reach it 
---
Well get downvoted punk 
---
So. Much. Salt.
---
They are both looter shooters. The games have fundamentally different gameplay in many ways but they both revolve around loot pinatas and twitch shooting action.
---
Ah yes, I have it at 15% first step I believe lol ty for info
---
Huh?!? How am I a punk? I‚Äôm replied in good faith with a light hearted comment and even to you I don‚Äôt think I was being a punk... am I???
---
People dont understand that this is probably a joke. No reason for downvotes
---
Add in a laser sword and you get a [jedi knight](https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.aPNZ2FZPx_YemNrKNOpukgHaId&amp;pid=Api)
---
Change into it on the last rock just before you reach the boss.  The boss fight is generally over quite quickly so no point risking a re-run if you don't have to.
---
I believe the Riven's Curse can be replaced with other mods but you would then lose them when applying Transcendent Blessing.
---
Yeah cause hunters dagger bs arnt op
---
Aye, don‚Äôt hate the player hate the game you blade barraging hunter üò§ lol üòÇ 
---
Actually, they removed elemental damage against supers. They no longer deal extra damage since the Forsaken loadout system was introduced 
---
Was thinking the same thing. I want my Titan to look sleek and aerodynamic; not like a big metallic tree or robot
---
Curated only drops in bergusia
---
I‚Äôd say grenade launcher 
---
In terms of theme and sleekness there was shit like this in D1 that we want in D2.
---
Anything with Powerful Gear, challenges like play one crucible match, complete a Strike, complete a Gambit Match are bankers for not much effort.  Complete 20 bounties for powerful gear from Ikora Rey, you can generally manage 3 or 4 daily strike challenges in one strike, likewise for Gambit and Crucible.  Spider and Petra's Bounties are also a good source and simply playing often to increase your chance of a Prime Engram - it all adds up!
---
I stalled when I hit around 605-610 but then it seemed to pick up and bit from there you just have to keep playing and prioritising what to do first.
---
Sorry I can't help as I'm on PS4 with a newly hit 650 Hunter.  Shame I haven't completed a Nightfall or Raid yet either!
---
Looks like ESO with guns
---
'Kind of big and awkward' sooooo titan armor...
---
Even the loot part is pretty different. It's a lot more Borderlands than it is Warframe. The looting systems are nothing a like, it's just the word 'loot'.
---
I had 1.6k hours in Warframe before I even looked at Destiny (and now I'm addicted do D2, oops) and always thought it would be similar because people said so and compared them, but that was a huge ass joke
---
My first hammerhead came with the rasmussen clan shader. I didn't enjoy it so I changed to the new age. Boi do I regret not dismantling that...
---
Just watched Megamind yesterday. Massively underrated movie.
---
Thanks, appreciate the detailed answer 
---
There are 3 if you have the season pass 
---
Yupp. Got 1k voices in a strike once.
---
I got my first completions through matchmaking at 611. If you can find a couple of \~650s to carry you, you can probably make it 590ish to 610ish.
---
Woah you pressed F on a mentally disabled team, well done.
---
Warframe is more like a third person shooter diablo to me. And yeah, I was speaking in those simplified terms.
---
Yes yes it is (we did that just so we could try and get the weirdest screenshot
---
The titan flair makes this art lmao
---
Working on that
---
When I stepped back through that Vex gate I was..."changed".
---
Cool I just jumped back in last week and I‚Äôm 560 light ish. Hopefully I can grind enough to get it
---
Yeah no problem, happy to help!
---
605 should get you through the first forge. 
---
I would, but there‚Äôs no free files out there to print that would be color accurate. There is a $20 one that I might print out soon
---
Once a day or more? I sort of want to do story quests and side quests aswell. Just killed Ghaul and need to get level 30 before Forsaken campaign.
---
Aye thanks again

Well done! Many y2 weapons I was looking forward to I can now be disappointed with BEFORE I acquire them! +1! :)

I hear ya, but that‚Äôs what it feels like to me. I hip fire it and it looks like it travels in a lobbed motion IDK whatever it is I like it!

Oof. But Crimson wouldn't be Crimson without its crimson

You got either of the other 2 trace rifles? They‚Äôre all boss, I main cold heart but use all of em. You could argue that wave splitter is better as the envoys have void shields 
---
We will never have armor that cool in Destiny 2
---
I did not know that. Still, wavesplitter destroyed my nova warp every time. And 2 full telesto shot hits would kill spectral blades. Anyway thanx for the info!
---
Yeah I like the look a lot not sure I‚Äôve ever seen that mask 
---
You can get Thunderlord from random drop, and you can get Hammerhead just from BA weapon frames. Avalanche is the only one you can't get right now.
---
Giggidy
---
This is correct.
---
Some bounties reward "powerful gear" which currently means gear that should increase your power level, but not higher than the cap is when you turn in the bounty.
---
It'll be changed to mean gear that should increase your power level, but not higher than the cap was when you picked up the bounty.
---
Anthem ain‚Äôt got shit on Destiny and this is why lol

I took a little mini break for a week and some change and got One Eyed Mask from Scourge. Was hyped.

What are your reasons for saying this? Honest question.  I know it can be unbalanced but I absolutely love it. Can‚Äôt wait for some fresh updates to it in next season. 
---
A needed change but not a fun one 
---

---
Not denying that 2 Phalanx &gt; Knight / 3 Phalanx &gt; Ogre for sure but It does happen. not to mention the horrible idea to force people to play badly to complete quests.

My bait did have a weak leg, you‚Äôre right.
---
If you just want the curated version then yes but you will only get a chance on each character
---
If you go into groups that KWTD you will learn very quickly and most of the time people are willing to help others out. It‚Äôs how I got good at Last wish and Scourge. I still don‚Äôt have the Trench Threat level, good luck to you!
---
This is important, people! Please, follow this!
---
It DOES NOT count the vault!!

ikr? And then you get downvoted because OP wasn‚Äôt polite enough to put a spoiler tag.

I love how I come to the destiny subreddit to be spoiled about GOT, but that‚Äôs reddit I guess, turning more into 4chan everyday.

I have a quad kill Handheld Supernova Video like this, I was tempted to post it but it was less a skillful play on my behalf and more of a dumb play on theirs.

Is it possible to make a official spoiler thread for us that wants one? 
---
Why
---
id rather see him work for bungie
---
The exact reason I went for wayfarer lol I want to give the lore implication that I‚Äôm on his side 
---
I don't think Xur should sell exotics from the expansion until the newest expansion could come out. It's boring to just have exotics spoon fed to you on a regular basis. Most of the A tier exotic weapons: Polaris/Sleeper/Whisper don't come from random drops anyways. 
---
I don't even play that much and I'm only missing two Exotic warlock pieces and a handful of weapons. I don't think I have a single Black Armory exotic other than Anarchy. 
---
But at the same time it gives people an opportunity to catch up on Exotics they missed out on. 
---
Dude i didnt mean to do it i got exactly 100 motes in a solo queue
---
It shouldn‚Äôt have to matter if PvP is crowded with a certain exotic, that means it needs to be fixed. 
---
Someone said that Lunafaction + Empowering Rift + Lunas Howl = a poor man's NotForgotten.
---
I havent tested it yet since I dont have the boots, but high impact snipers (bite of the fox) could probably one hit kill on the body.
---
Not sure, this may be art for the book 
---
Dredgen is basically "Darth" for Destiny
---
Ya know those darn cookie elves.
---
I don't wait on orbs- the same logic is when I see a teamate in Gambit waiting 20 seconds for the heavy weapon drop. If I invade a portal with only my kinetic weapon I take my bloody time versus going in guns blazing had I been given more options with supers/heavy/specials- but thats just me, my logic in any match is M.A.D (mutually Assured destruction) always 1-1 ratio unless given more options?
---
Because it's strictly for PVP, I'd say do something with Sixth Coyote and the dodge that reloads your weapons for minimum manual reload time. 
---
I would actually pay for a skin like that 
---
I‚Äôm honestly not sure about exotic quests but I‚Äôm pretty sure the pinnacle weapons that you get from shaxx, Zavala and the drifter don‚Äôt put markers on the map. 
---
Timegated apparently.  Next warm day and the lost sector is gone.  I see you, Bungie.
---
I‚Äôve heard that method floated around but I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs supposed to work
---
I mean we could always ping an API guy, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs actually in charge of the triumph points. So I don‚Äôt think that would help lol.   
---
**Surely** your friend is a Bungie employee and is boosting his own number illegally.

Ok it wasn‚Äôt you, this team had small blockers coming over every few seconds and every time I invaded I couldn‚Äôt walk a couple of feet without getting sniped or shotgunned 
---
#~~Un~~Solved Mysteries with /u/SpaceOgresWithLasers.
---
The 1 you can buy from shaxx is actually pretty great, has all the right perks on it 
---
Oh dude, I don‚Äôt know. We just used his current gear setup. 
---
Exotics don't feel "rare"
---
Getting a sweet raid drop like the sparrow, 1k voices, anarchy, curated rolls on certain weapons feel "rare" because you have some agency over how you obtain them, exotics aren't rare or prestigious especially when they come from almost any activity in the game and there's no way to directly pursue them, it's just "oh he got lucky doing this random bounty".
---
&gt;Prevent the crucible from being overcrowded with OEMs and etc
---
I mean comp is exclusively gwisin, shards or OEM titans on PC so?
---
&gt;Prevent the nerfing of these weapons and armor which are relatively tolerable due to their rarity - Because Destiny needs strong gear
---
If the only thing stopping something something from getting nerfed is people not having ease of access too it, then it's clearly broke to begin with.
---
&gt;Keep Xur as a catch-up method for less committed players. Releasing Forsaken exotics after the 2 remaining annual pass DLCs have been dropped will allow for this.
---
There are plenty of ways to check off year 1 exotics that don't involve xur, Leviathan is still a guaranteed 2-3 y1 exotics and people run it for catalysts frequently.
---
The workaround I did was quit out the game then reopened it and it would ask if I wanted to rejoin the expedition then I‚Äôd load in
---
Yeah I normally use a hammerhead for gambit, if I happen to have some power ammo and there is already a dedicated invader I find that queenbreaker does jack to the prime/envoys, the hammerhead is sort of a jack of all trades.
---
Yep
---
Yeah I‚Äôm okay with Xur not selling the current seasons exotics. I also see people‚Äôs point about the duplicate problem. It is pretty crazy that someone can grind for months and not get all the exotics. Like, sure I doubt anyone wants it to be easy, but after months (3+) of *heavy* playing you should basically have everything that‚Äôs a random drop (because while some games may be able to support many months or even like a year of grinding for a piece of gear, I don‚Äôt know that Destiny has enough to do to justify that). But I don‚Äôt think Xur would be the way to fix that, that‚Äôs a drop rate/duplicate issue, and obviously it‚Äôs something Bungie is watching as they tweaked it not long ago. It‚Äôs probably tough to find a sweet spot in between ‚Äúwe got everything in a week‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôve grinded for 4 months and still don‚Äôt have half the exotics‚Äù.
---
As to your point that it‚Äôs a bad idea because some of the gear is OP and you don‚Äôt want to see a nerf, well, I think that‚Äôs a bit of flawed reasoning. Gear should be balanced. I‚Äôm all for powerful stuff, but not for a single thing to be significantly stronger than anything else. I‚Äôd prefer to see weaker stuff buffed than strong stuff nerfed. But the important thing is balance, and if the availability of an exotic throws that balance off, that‚Äôs a sign there needs to be a rework of some sort.
---
It does look cool
---
Mm
---
Using individual bullet damage instead of Dps is like saying a sniper with one bullet is the strongest gun in the game because of its crit
---
!Remind me 5 years
---
Sal the berserker from BL2 approves this post. 
---
Did shooting grenade launcher projectile is a thing since launch ? or in D1 ? or exclusive for The Last Word ? :O
---
you mean the purple pain?
---
i had a friend who always would dual wield. his name is evan.... i'll never forget you, evan...
---
Well shit
---
What does the nerf do
---
Yeah its crazy the power level difference between say, foetracer and shards lol
---
I like exotics like Dragons Shadow or Stom-eez, but there is no reason for me to ever not use rigs because it just does so much fucking work.
---
I'll check that one out, thanks buddy 
---
Not my work mate. Just trying to this awesome artist more exposure
---
This is why they ended trials. Guardians cuddling in massive stupidity. Not one person decided to use their radar. Awesoms team wipe. 
---
I feel like this could be a mtg card art
---
let the grind to have bounties ready on the day thorn comes out begin
---
[removed]
---
I'm trying to see if the artist would consider doing it. 
---
What cloak is that?
---
Don't see why not, I could replace this post with that and include the spoiler warning there. Thanks for the suggestion!
---
‚ÄúAnyone who thinks they‚Äôre good at this game can KMA‚Äù

Just because you‚Äôre bad at the game doesn‚Äôt mean you gotta tear into people that are, my sweet pouty baby boy
---
There's nothing wrong with being that guy, its not your fault, you're just using the tools you are given lol
---
I'd do the same thing if I had the vest haha
---
So instead of just buffing other subclasses, they're nerfing one too?
---
They went back to they're dumb nerfing habits of D1. I don't touch the Pvp but I hope it doesn't affect PvE.
---
That would be soooo cool.
---
I...I don't understand...lol
---
Being new to the game a lot of things discussed on this sub go completely over my head.  Someone want to clarify?
---
What's a worlock?
---
No but I‚Äôd like to see a warlock in that style 
---
Why do they keep adding more and more hand cannons there are so many weapon types but they keep making and bringing back hand cannons I just don't get it. 
---
What is this even a picture of I've looked at it from like five different angles????
---
I haven‚Äôt had any luck like this before. 
---
I for one welcome our new hunter overlords 
---
The gun that you first see in this video was from the very first year of the game. It was so godly, a two shot to the head with good aim. It was nerfed but still pretty good. At the end, when you see those bullets go into the wall, that is another god-tier way OP weapon from the same year. In the lore, the two have a rivalry and could both make an argument for one one the best weapons in Destiny history.
---
I'm saying what I think is going to happen, not that it will. Sorry it came off as that way.

Everyone can slide, not just Hunters. The invisibility is still easy to see unless your eyesight is bad. I can't count how many times I've gone invisible, peeked out from a corner and immediately been shot. Active camo from Halo CE was way better.
---
Keep weapons at each lvl as you go so that you can lvl up alt characters quicker and to go ahead and create alts even if you haven't finished the story mission on the first one.  
---
Work on them at the same time. Maybe have stopping point each week or alternate days between them to keep them at around the same lvl/light/progression.  You will gain light faster because you can swap higher light weapons between them to increase light faster.  The higher your light, the easier you will find various missions/activities to be.
---
Go to Hawthorn everytime you level up, she will have 4 pieces you can buy for glimmer that will help you increase yoru light faster.  As soon as the mission you are on is over, go see her.
---
Use a fireteam medallion from Tess as soon as you can buy one, until then, find an XP ghost if you can and use it.   (If you have a higher lvl friend that can run the missions with you, they can give you a boost by using one.)
---
Do the Orange &amp; Blue missions as they come up.  Don't wait.  They will help you with XP, give you higher gear, and some give upgrade points for your class abilibities.  The sooner you have all 3 classes fully unlocked on all three characters the better.  
---
Learn how to turn every public even heroic.  Google it.  Heroic public events give more xp and have a chance to drop better loot.  It is a small chance, but it is there.  Jump into every public event you can along the way.
---
Join a clan.  You can get an extra power drop every week for doing clan bounties, as well as 4 more for the clan completing activities together.
---
Visit Xur every weekend to buy what ever you can from him.  You will need to save your shards for this, and you do not start getting shards until you start getting purple engrams to drop.  Shards come from dismantling legendary and exotic gear and legendary shaders gotten from anywhere but Tess.  Common &amp; Rare shaders and gear give glimmer, unless from Tess. Tess' shaders give you bright dust when dismantled.  
---
Wait, so the space hobo look doesn't work for everyone? Who doesn't like some armor with rubber tubing and a big saggy ass?

You kinda have to carry 0-1800 tho. That's mainly what I did. Im a pvp main and as long as your evenly setup with rank 1800 players passed then it's pretty damn easy. I don't bother with the stacks. By the time I was done with the quest I was 2600. The people that are below 1800 this late in the season are simply not great at pvp which is why average players late in a season seem to take forever to get to 1800. I have more luck beating stacks with solo 1800 players and that says something. 
---
Ah well I think that might be where it‚Äôs at next week guess I know what I‚Äôll be farming ha 
---
Those "thorns" hitting the wall look like projectiles from malfeasance imo
---

I found a tatara gaze with boxed breathing, works like a charm on tether hunter

Along with malfesance and swarm of the raven.
---
Momma raised no quitter!
---
Actually, no. It is my belief that both the upcoming Anthem release is putting pressure on Bungie, and with Activision out of the picture they have more room to do what they know the D2 player base wants. Hence the Thorn. If you hadn't responded in such a shitty knee-jerk manner you might have realized that, and I'm sorry you needed it spelled out for you.
---
Dont use *Of Mice And Men* artwork for this.
---
Telesto's death is not a tragedy, it's a time for celebration.
---
Yeah but even without it it's much better than any melee Hunters or Warlocks have.
---
Really interesting point there.  Players that are late in the seasons are the ones still struggling to make it.  Good point.  Maybe I‚Äôll try it again.  It‚Äôs crazy how much harder it is when you go against a stack than it is just random though.  When I play 4-6 people in a group communicating against me it‚Äôs hard as hell.  So you would think me playing in a group would be much more effective. 
---
I don't think it's going to ship like that, though. 
---
Would like to see this guy making armor in game 
---
[Here's a handy article showing how to get every exotic](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-01-10-destiny-2-exotics-list-exotic-weapon-exotic-armour-4747). The ones that are random drops from the base game, Curse of Osiris, and Warmind can be bought from Xur, a hidden NPC who appears on a different planet each Friday and then disappears on Tuesday. Right now he is on the Rig on Titan. 
---
Luna's Howl is from a quest. You can get it from Shaxx, but I don't remember what it's called. It may be on the second page. Shaxx also has a quest for Mountaintop and Redrix's Broadsword. 
---
I think most things in the Dreaming City are power level 540, so you are very close to being able to play there! It changes on a three week cycle, so next week, if you haven't already gotten all 3 seeds of light, you should do Petra's Gateway Between Worlds bounty in order to get an offering to the oracle. On the third week of the Dreaming City's curse cycle (when it looks most taken) you can get one seed of light from the oracle engine like that. 
---
Pretty much tough guy, want a cookie? Mr. Pretend to be uber l33t and wtf pwn guys that can jump shot pwn him in pvp...

im confused, where does the thron show up?

idk, I played with spectre right when it came out and never had gwinsim, so I just assume it's still as it was haha

Yup got Redrix and Luna's, I'm good brah. How about you?
---
I had thorn in d1 but can‚Äôt remember how I got it? I thought it dropped in crota
---
No, that wasn't my intention. I haven't played with spectre since it first came out and i never used Gwinsim with it. I was just stating how weak Hunter supers feel defensively. more so the latter too.
---
Aye and I‚Äôve got a unicorn that I ride to work everyday 
---
Platform? PC matchmaking works fine, literally every time. Perhaps a console issue?
---
Hunlock 
---
This seems to happen when other players take out their ghosts and manually leave the activity before others have loaded in, or they are still stuck in a long loading screen. I don't think it's matchmaking, so much as how you are automatically placed back into matchmaking after only 10 seconds (I think 25-30 if you get maximum temper), so a lot of people don't exit until it's too late and they've been matched into another forge. 
---
My very first time in the Bergusia forge, I had *four people* take out their ghosts and leave. 
---
Meh. Good for what it's for, especially afte the change but nothing beyond that
---
Are going with how it looks normally or trying to make it look how it goes with the ornament ?
---
I had it happen on pc. I just reloaded then search and found people. Also sometimes you‚Äôll get lucky and people will join after 20 seconds or so of playing it solo. 
---
What is your light level?
---
Yeah, I already started doing that. I didn't even know Xur existed for like the first three weeks I was playing the game and I don't even want to think about what Exotics I missed ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Yeah I get you, like I don‚Äôt want them to completely destroy it, just make it a bit more situational to put it on par with the others
---
F
---
Yeah that is true, happens sometimes. They could alleviate this by eliminating the auto queue after each one. Sometimes I look at my character and forget, and then end up leaving after it loaded me into another, screwing over the next team. Kinda dumb. 
---
Offering to the oracle? Sorry I haven't been to the dreaming city much
---
‚Ñ≤
---
That's my secret: I never had one.
---
Mine definitely didn't, but that might be because masterworked gear didn't exist when I first got it.
---
Ready to go FullDan
---
Like stated above; The weapon doesn't have kill clip. We already know the perks it will have. It doesn't feature the increased damage on hip shot damage it had in D1 either, so the damage you see is the same, no matter what.
---
The only problem i see with that effective range is.. that close, any shotgun user won't take more than one shot against you. So runnibg in like they do in the trailer would be incredibly dumb.
---
Bungie stated if you‚Äôre saving your bounties it‚Äôs only going to drop at 650 light so sorry you‚Äôre kinda waiting for nothing special 
---
It is getting nerfed for the duration though and we are getting a buff for Dawnblade. I wish we had a super exotic (No, not the healing helmet, nobody uses it)
---
I'm perfectly fine with supers being shut down like that. 
---
People datamined and found out that Thorn was coming in Joker's Wild time ago. Pretty much everyone knew it was coming, this is just the confirmation of it. It hasn't been put into the game because of Anthem at all. Although I do agree that Anthem's release will (hopefully) 'put the pressure on' and make Destiny better, Thorn popping up here ain't got shit to do with Anthem at all
---
Do you want to be like Cayde? Because that is how you end up like Cayde!
---
Man I've never wanted to dual wield so bad in destiny before
---
It doesn't matter until the next season. Cap right now is 650. All your powerful gear bounties acquired from this season will be a Max light of 650. So, if you save them until March they'll only be 650 even though season if there Drifter power Max is 700. If you save it this week to help get your weekly from Ada next week, you're fine and won't lose out.
---
I dont even run a titan class with OHK I run top tree sentinel with bubble super for comp. I literally understand everybodys argument on here about the exotic. The only thing I am trying to say is if a player that sucks is using it they are still going to suck. It will make a decent player a little bit better and it could be very OP when used by people that are good at crucible. 
---
Is it the same for PS4?
---
Diablo 3 crusader vibes
---
Galanor absolutely does not need a nerf. It‚Äôs extremely inconsistent and BB is already getting a nerf anyway
---
mercules just posted about it. he has a huge list up, search the front page and you should find it
---
The snow‚Äôs speaking Finnish
---
If they nerf it for PvE I‚Äôm going to lose my shit
---
What bothers me is that the actual Forsaken trailer shows someone on a sparrow up there
---
The trailer hasn't been out for a day and I'm already experiencing horrible ptsd 
---
The only exotics I get are Catalysts :(
---
Then more luminous rocks is the answer!!
---
/s
---
Plasma pistol on my left. Magnum on my right. A Sangheli‚Äôs worst nightmare.
---
I hope that they come out with some new exotics too for SotD and not just bringing back the classics.
---
Yay more old content
---
Transversives or ophidian are the best anyways, and our supers are good enough to not need an exotic. 
---
Uhmmmmm. Question. Is it three tapping people? It looks like it's three tapping. At increased ROF even.... Even if it was base 180 that puts it at Lunas/NF TTK.
---
Woohoo new meta! 
---
They just stood there...
---
There are 24 maps in the game. Whatever list you are looking at is not updated. Destiny had around 15 base game maps and has released more after curse of osirus , warmind and forsaken. Every single map is used. Not all for competitive but for quick play and iron banner ever map is used besides eternity. 
---
U didnt say anything about 1k voices because it is an rng drop. You literally said you dont do the forge because you have to get to 650 and complete all three forges to get those drops.
---
Wavesplitter is a rng weapon only from exotic engrams and it is getting a nerf on Tuesday. 
---
Bungie reward the people that attempt the forges to get jotunn. You aren't guaranteed to get it but if you didnt know your chance fo to 0% if you dont do it.
---
Black ops 3 has that many maps because it had 4 map packs and 4 extra maps for preordering b04. It's not about beating the amount of maps it has. Also a large proportion of b03 maps are remastered maps from older games. 
---
If you get spike grenades on mountain top or militias birthright with direct hits it always one shot. With 184 damage from the explosion and 54 from the hit.
---
Malfeasance quest was broken for the first two curse cycles but know is very likely to spawn bosses at a high rate on a curse week.
---
I have lunas and redrix. You think I dont know how crucible is but I do.
---
 I know you think your super smart looking at outdated numbers about maps and damage values but your not I have access to the same shit you have but your not looking at it. If you dont want to deal with rng maybe a game like destiny isn't for you. If you think playing on a higher amount of remastered maps are fun you can go back to b04 since you love it so much.
---
Since you have consistently failed to state facts and made up your own shit to fit your arguement I'm done talking to you.
---
P.s. if you think you're going to get not forgotten but when you posted when you were at 1300 glory that you were willing to pay someone to help you get to lunas you're not gonna get it. Have fun being a "hardcore" pvp player while everyone just enjoys the whole game. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure if it works the same but I‚Äôm pretty sure you can license transfer 
---
As an avid Birthright user, it's been a thing. It happens but not too often.
---
I had one of mine shot out the air a foot from my face. Cheeky bastards with great aim.
---
Yes. But I mean, we want soooomething. Maybe an exotic to stack damage for dawnblade while in super for kills like how the new titan subclass has roaring flames. 
---
Your post states you hit with a retold take with max range perk. Retold tale is a shotgun. So...
---
You think it will require Gambit powerful bounties?
---
My time is worth very little.
---
This happened to me 2 days ago. Just aim for the red of the grenade launcher and pray for perfect timing 
---
Who the fuck are you playing against that is using shoulder charge in this shotgun meta? 
---
The bridge will be used in the future. As the Dreaming City storyline progresses, eventually we will be using it. The bridge is shown being driven on in one of the original Forsaken trailers. Most speculations are that we will see this upcoming weeks visit or at least the next visit to Mara revealing events leading towards that bridge. 
---
You get put into matchmaking with the forges abound 10 levels around your level. So you might have to level up a little bit to get more consistent matchmaking. If that's as high as you can get this week I would recommend using the lfg on the destiny app. You should be able to find people willing to help there.
---
Thanks for all the replys guys. Ill tell him ill sherpa if he needs. I personally would have done it just to help out and maybe gain a follower or two but if its a bannable offense ill tell him i cant. Once again thank you for all the help!
---
No hand cannons are the one true gun there can never be to many 
---
I'd also like to propose that they add more activities that have a boosted exotic chance. It seems like all we have now is that spider bounty. People would probably be less mad about the lack of exotics dropping if we had something that let us say "maybe this time."
---
What do you guys think?
---
As a fervant user of Fighting Lion in Crucible, I've eaten shit to my own grenades more than once.
---
I didn't play killzone, it's a character ? :)
---
Avalanche is still garbo. If you have access to a Hammerhead, you use Hammerhead over Avalanche every time.
---
True of any roaming super. If you shit yourself and let the warlock pulse gleefully through the map withoit resistance of course it will go to town. Not sure what the Nerf will do honestly but if it becomes "lose to every super" like every other warlock super it's going to be pretty sad. 
---
When people were first getting ahold of the random drop bounty for thorn the special mission at the end was very hard yes
---
Pretty much everyone had trouble with it at first 
---
It can... with a fire team full of izangis 
---
Because the explosion radius is bs. 
---
Will thorn and last word be available to people who don‚Äôt have the annual pass?
---
Worth. Now you have a dildo business.
---
Send your Xbox clips to OneDrive, open OneDrive on your phone and download. That‚Äôs what I do without a recording software. It‚Äôs kind of a hassle, and can take upwards of an hour to upload to OneDrive based on how long the clip is, but it works.
---
Just wait until Joker‚Äôs Wild. It‚Äôs gonna be pure hell.
---
I‚Äôve gotten 3 Frost-EE5‚Äôs in the last week so...
---
The change won't change much.
---
Helghast are like space nazis I was trying to say the gun looks like their primary assault rifle
---
I loved Of Mice and Men
---
*Screams in HP*
---
And you would fan the LW by smacking the hammer with thorn üòÇ
---
Yeah. You're right. I guess they could also make factions joinable at all times and just have special rewards during faction wars.
---
You never go FullDan
---
Mida multi tool crucible users need to unite against the Titans!
---
Because every video was from launch and masterworking wasnt at launch. Check time stamps before you make a reddit post.
---
Hey man, I‚Äôd be down to help you out if you‚Äôre still looking for a 3rd. 
---
Ah yes... the facti9n catalysts that they Actually said that there will be other ways to obtain them afterwards.. and here we are.. ffs.
---
I'm a new player and have no clue what the hype.is about. Can someone fill me in please.
---
Most probably just the last part, so do riven with 4 pieces of the armour 
---
Your we're 
---
Did you stroke out writing that comment?
---
When you stub your toe
---
650 hunter here. I find spectral blades to be the most broken super in game atm. Invisibility, avoid radar detection, see through walls, fast as fuck, lasts forever. If you use Gwisin Vest in 6v6 you can almost keep your  super up indefinitely. How is this super not needed before nova warp?
---
That's great news, thank you for the heads up! 
---
Black armory gear = Forge armor 
---
Hunter is Woven Firesmith set
---
Titan is Forged Machinist set
---
Warlock is Annealed Shaper set
