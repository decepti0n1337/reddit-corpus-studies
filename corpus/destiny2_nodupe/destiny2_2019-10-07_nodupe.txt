The group i followed took about 3 or 4 hours to clear the first encounter. But they totally blocked at the second encounter...do your math...this is really sad.
---

---
I'm talking about a group of regular raid players, they do tutorials for the french community. Here determination didn't pay off. Sad story.
---
---
---
The campaign is separate
---
So he didn't have light in the campaign but did everywhere else
---
Yes
---
Very true, and you're downvoted of course.
---
Oh that's very strange. I'm sorry I've never heard of this happening before. It just sounded like you were checking planetary vendors since they always only have 3 bounties. I don't know what the problem is, but good luck. I hope you solve it.
---
What are some good pvp weapons i can get out of the gate as a new light player?
---
Sir, yes sir.
---
Boo hoo.  Triple-A developer doesn't have enough time or money to make new content without reusing old content.
---
Record a clip and put it on the bug forum
---
can you play that section if youve already played destiny 1? or is it only for people brand new, it'd be cool to see those levels again
---
NeKhornes
---
Who did I tell to not play comp? The dudes with no gear? What experience do you think they're missing out on? Being rolled?üòÇüòÇüòÇ jesus christ hoes rlly mad
---
Even for PvE, dodging out of an Ogres laser gaze late game can be life saving. With effective modifiers, thralls will shred you in seconds, but if you hover and dodge to get away it‚Äôs a game changer.
---
Most late game Dawnbreakers opt for Well of Radiance subclass because it makes a challenging fight turn into a test dummy run. I don‚Äôt think that play style is fun, but to each their own.
---
Had  a friend spend 10 hours on the 3rd encounter alone. They had one person who could not do anything, would have like 3x less final boss damage than everything else and was anchoring the team. The problem was that he was the clan leader so they couldnt remove him.
---
Bungie isn‚Äôt exactly a Triple-A developer. Actually they just lost a very big asset Activision so they‚Äôll have even less money and time.
---
The other planet missions were not "linear" to the campaign. You could do them in addition to the story. The Mars ones are the campaign. You need to see Amanda in the tower hanger to start them.
---
It's so fucking slow if you only use this thing during Crucible
---
I have a different name on ps4. How2L0seURselF
---
You should do in story missions from the directory when they are available (shuffles weekly) and certain quests like for the risk runner.
---
You can't just go and wander around the cosmodrome again though (cries inside).
---

---
Another thing people don‚Äôt know about too is the fact that this dodge can break the aerial launch of knock backs from big boys. Instead of hitting a wall hard enough to kill you or falling off a cliff edge, you can dodge and it‚Äôll break that aerial effect, giving you control again.
---
What
---
Damn it
---
Some people have been day 1 raiding, watching videos, watching streams, and practicing endlessly to try to beat it week 1. They don't want you to join if you have none of that backing up your gameplay because then they'll have to spend another 4+ hours getting you through the encounter.
---
You are more than welcome to make your own group on the LFG discords. I've seen quite a few groups of blind runs even.
---
Update: game runs terribly on my PC. üòî
---
Oh yeah easily
---
Oh okay thanks, I saw a post where people were saying the Hephaestus adventure was the best for getting kills with Riskrunner so I figured that the adventure would be easily startable.
---
I was earning 1% without double as well
---
hmmm.. worth it for me
---
Yesterday i played my first comp match, i was levelling so didn‚Äôt have the best gear yet i went into it. I‚Äôve played since d1 but comp never excited me and i was a hardcore pve player. At the start i wasn‚Äôt the best but today i got fabled and got recluse and mountaintop. If you tell everyone with sucky gear not to play comp then they will never get better. This game clearly isn‚Äôt for you dude considering we‚Äôre supposed to be helping new players. Get a grip.
---
 
---
 To all new guardians, you can do it! Go into comp and try your best! I really enjoy freelance comp as I‚Äôm a solo player, never give up!
---
Yes. DLCs are tied to the platform they are bought on
---
I feel the same brother. I played a shit ton of D1 but D2 is mad confusing. To get the gist of things happening go to Amanda Holiday in the hangar of the tower and she gives you all the questlines for the game
---
I'll check that out
---
Did you know Whisper of the worm is a reskin of a blue year 1 sniper and Revoker is a reskin of a destiny 1 sniper.
---
I checked Zavala first, however *all* bounty vendors only have three options, not just planetary vendors.
---
I‚Äôm light 900, how exactly do I go up to 950? I know all about powerful and prime engrams but am confused on the actual process. Say I‚Äôm 900 and have a 905 helmet and gauntlets, do I still grind for powerful or do I do normal things and the items will drop past 900?
---
Okay but  why would you do that
---
I played D1 but i don‚Äôt remember anything after the first dlc came out üò≠
---
Forsaken raids are probably worth it. Usually people tend to keep running Destiny raids even when they aren't relevant anymore. Still probably plenty of people running them to get the rare exotics to drop, plus if you buy Forsaken you also get the new super trees that came with that expansion!
---
They updated the game, like now players below 900 don't have access to daily/weekly challenges or powerful engrams until 900. Some saved their past weekly bounties but didn't cash them in until shadowkeep released
---
The best stuff is in the grimoire though.
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
Only when you reach a New rank... Not the sub ranks. So All the ranks with a 1 in it...
---
Will I eventually get to where Destiny 2 starts? Or do I have to buy the new Shadowkeep dlc to access D2?
---
Yeah ik, I was only joking, honestly it is kind of the reverse of all of this, everything is taking away from my free time aka time to sit back and relax while playing d2 with my friends
---
I think it can still drop from strikes but yeah. The mission is really easy. And catalyst at the end. Catalyst extends range if im not mistaken.
---
Yeah, right now is the calm before the shitstorm where everybody goes ballistic. There was plenty of stuff, but everything definitely got overhyped and overplayed by bungie
---
people like you are the reason games are becoming less grindy, just complaining about it
---
It was that. Thanks so much you guys.
---
I'm just returning since warmind and I'm already scared.
---
Restart the game. If you've completed the other objectives it should pop up.
---
I got you fam:
---
* On your character screen, you have weapons on the left, armor on the right. In the upper right, you have your currencies: Glimmer (blue blocks), Legendary Shards (purple crystals) - you may have bright dust (orange glowing balls), and silver if you bought any, but the first two are the important ones. 
---
   * Glimmer comes from playing the game, looting crates, killing enemies, bounties, etc. You'll also receive some every time you dismantle a weapon or armor piece. 
---
   * Legendary shards come from dismantling legendary (purple) or exotic (yellow) items. You'll get three or a legendary item, and 5 for an exotic. 
---
* Each weapon and armor piece has an infusion button, powered by upgrade modules. You can get these from Banshee-44 in the tower, or from leveling up your season rank. This lets you take a more powerful item and infuse it into a weaker item to bring the weaker item up to the power level of the stronger item. This will consume an upgrade module and the stronger item in the process. 
---
* Each piece of armor has an elemental affinity (solar, arc, void - orange, blue, purple) and a mod charge. You can increase the mod charge by inspecting the armor and clicking on the hammer icon at the end of the charge bar. It'll tell you what it'll cost you resource-wise before you complete the transaction. The elemental affinity combined with the energy bar determines what and how many mods you can slot into a given piece of armor. 
---
   * Mods are what determine your perks and additional stats. Armor will drop with a predetermined set of stats, and then you can add mods to get perks or change the value of the preset stats. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Until you get up to 900, don't worry about blue vs purple, just equip whatever's most powerful that you like. If you have something you don't like or don't want to use that's more powerful than your equipped gear, just keep it - **the game will use any gear you have on your character(s) or in your vault to determine your max power, which determines the power of your drops.** 
---
Once you get to 900, you'll start finding weapons and armor that you really like, and that's when you can start infusing things to build your ideal load out.
---
You have to accept it in your collections. Like go to the triumph list and go to the tab and collect it
---
There is an emblem of destiny tracker.com
---
Was fugly as hell
---
Alt tabbed back in because I joined quickly. Just in time to hit them with that YWEET.
---
‚ÄúThe Summoning Pits‚Äù where you can‚Äôt summon your sparrow.
---
Good to know, thank you.
---
I believe SMG damage was buffed (among a ton of other buffs/nerds) in shadowkeep.
---
I don‚Äôt know if there were specific exclusions for exotics or riskrunner in that buff but I kinda doubt it.
---
Nerds=nerfs. Keeping it.
---
Touch√©.
---
Man there‚Äôs to many bugs going on lol I was just confused cause my friends are getting there class gear
---
No they don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm terrible at pvp
---
There was a bug in D1 where u can go on top of the roof to shoot. Does that still work?
---
Currently, the soft cap is 900 and the hard gear cap is 950. However, once you reach level 7 on your season pass (can check on map screen to the far right) you‚Äôll get the seasonal artifact. That grants light levels each time you level up, giving you essentially infinite levels. I wouldn‚Äôt really recommend doing the curse of Osiris campaign unless you‚Äôre bored as it doesn‚Äôt unlock much and isn‚Äôt really good. Warmind gives you access to Polaris lance and sleeper stimulant which are pretty good. I‚Äôd recommend trying to get the forges, reckoning and menagerie activities as they give some very meta gear (the currently very meta snipes, hand cannons and shotguns can be obtained from these activities. I‚Äôd also recommend trying the raids since they‚Äôre pretty fun
---
DM me and I‚Äôll send an invite when I get home
---
I‚Äôve been sacraficeing sleep for shadow keep already level 59 in season pass but, haven‚Äôt had more then 2 hours of sleep since Tuesday
---
I must be truly atrocious, as I played 7 games and lost them all.  I also went against a lot of people with Last Word, Recluse, and each match had at least one striker Titan with OEM.  Didn't see many Mountaintops though.  Oh well... hopefully they get bored with the stomping and i can find a few games that are skill-matched.
---
I did this last night! Same strike but it was my last grenade launcher that secured victory! üëå
---
I just didn‚Äôt know it glowed when you shot it
---
I remember raping that ogre with my icebreaker behind that small ledge...miss those times.
---
Literally unplayable.
---
How is this helpful? There is a legitimate solution that takes zero time
---
I think that answered my question, thanks!
---
I think the site is down right now

Are you mentally disabled?

You will not be refunded the silver
---
Thank you very much
---
Lore.
---
Yes I got 5 of them. Go to Eris and collect a ghost trace. Find the ghost and it tells you a story. You get lore.
---
Yes you can, you can pull it out of your collections. You can actually pull it out of your collections even if you didn‚Äôt get it. It‚Äôll be 20 power below your power level, but you can get it again.
---
I‚Äôm confused now because mine is at 3% and I could have sworn the last 2 percents came from 1 gambit prime match each
---
And youre so focused on thinking I'm gonna get answer and go to that specific activity to farm
---
yea I have a special ammo shot gun I have equipped can it's the only one that uses special. so I normally dont use it cause when I'm close I'll normally use melee for the health. are there kinetic bows? I have 3 but they're all energy bows.
---
Bruh i can still see everything, on r/leagueoflegends you have to click it to see the post at least.
---
We still going with these kind of posts? Original
---
Downvoted for speaking the truth haha. This isn't even clever or funny, it's just so, damn, dull. But whatever. It's obviously really cool........
---
Thanks a ton man. I‚Äôm coming back to D2 after about a year so the new UI is a little confusing :p
---
Well as the other comment said it is tagged as a spoiler and if u don't want spoilers maybe don't be on Reddit it's just like u should never go on Facebook after a new movie u wanna see comes out
---
Nice
---
The mod is in the world drop list of mods. If you get a world drop, that is a mod, it spins the RNG wheel to see which mod you get. If you're lucky, it drops the one you want. That's all. There is no guide, method, strategy, plan that will increase your odds of getting it.
---
I missed it. What'd you do?
---
From this season specifically? Idk. One of the new exotics. The new guns aren‚Äôt really all that.
---
I‚Äôve really enjoyed shadowkeep. The forsaken campaign that Spider will kick off is great too.
---
They're called clans here in Destiny. :-) https://www.bungie.net/en/Groups/Forum?groupId=2111385
---
R/ClansofDestiny may be worth looking thru also.
---
I'm in the same category if you are.
---
D1 beta on (ps3) through to TTk then on to d2 and then switched to pc.
---
destinytracker.com typen in your psn and scroll down.
---
The only thing I'm thinking about you is pity at your lack of comprehension.
---
There is no "guide" which can be made to get a Discipline Mod, just do the things that reward mods and keep doing that until you get it.
---
I scrolled through my page and it came up by random. Im also used to posts having a click to see spoiler black cover.
---
Im also really tired and sleepdeprived bcause mental health so saying fu was uneccessary yeh...
---
Well shit there is a black cover now, i might be crazy...
---
Ju gotta do alotta stuff. Look under triumphs then go to the bottom. Gotta get kills with jotunn at Bergiusia, Izanagi on Nessus, forge a shit load of weapons, do raid challenges, and much more lol
---
What platform? If your on Xbox I can and will play along to help. DM me your tag.
---
but still get killed by a tank from 50 foot drop.
---
I did last wish earlier and the jump puzzle before I think the last boss I swear I died 40 times. Wanted to leave lol
---
There is so little cover in this room. I can't stress this enough.
---
As some one who could never get Luna's the lack of recoil in that weapons *disgusts* me.  I feel like you stacked a recoil control mod on every armor piece.
---
I like it
---
it's just a form of hype from the community that eventually turns into a meme of some sort. you can go to the moon and shit in D1 and we are all just excited to go back and punch some thralls.
---
plus you know the spawn points and where to go in the strikes.
---
But you don't rush ahead on the train strike because "they have too learn!".
---
You know, just the other day I made this same exact joke to my boys in Discord. I gotta get into making memes.
---
No it's for mods in general I already got answers on the other mod types
---
What system are you and what time do you usually play?
---
Also need time zone.
---
Get some sleep
---
Earth :)
---
Thanks
---
You can only get them from the eververse store now
---
I‚Äôm like 99% sure you‚Äôre trolling. You just stuffed the most random shit into that comment that had nothing to do with the person you were replying to
---
I'm new and it makes no god damn sense, I opened Destiny 2 for the first time and I got a steam achievement for reaching level 20, then it recommends me to do the new light questline and it clearly skips over story missions. So I look for some help on youtube and luckily one guy tells me where to get the legacy campaigns. I start that and I get what seems to be at one point the base weapon set. Only they up my powerlevel a lot even though they're obvious trash compared to the legendary weapons I got from the first few tutorial missions. Turns out the legacy campaign starts with the movement tutorials. 
---
Oh I almost forgot the very first thing I did was getting dropped on EDZ, in a public event. Turns out you can turn those into heroic, something I had no idea about. So the first thing they do with new players is throwing them in a situation where you screw it up for others. Just great. Then it opens up and you see NPCs giving you quests like, do a strike, do a raid, do gambit, do crucible... 
---
So it's possible for a new player to be dropped in a raid from the start without even seeing the basic controls... 
---
To me, it's a big mess, and it's a pity because I kinda like the gameplay. I avoid a lot of multiplayer team games because I hate the feeling of being THAT guy, and the game as it's designed makes you feel like you're forced to be that guy.
---
This is surprisingly wholesome.
---
Haven't had the pleasure of using monte carlo yet but i know first hand you can go sicko mode in crucible with suros.
---
Was my first and I'll never forget it.
---
Yeah the basic stuff does feel that way I‚Äôve had friends give the same complaint but i got them to go into the more hardcore stuff and that helped with the problem
---
Duplicate drops still somewhat exist, although it‚Äôs not as crippling as it used to be thanks to mild dupe protection and Prime Engrams.
---
I know this is probably a joke but if they do that the games entire balance would be screwed.
---
It works without speed demon as well. At least at the last launch portal.
---

---
In my mind this brings up interesting questions about just how much of the code was brought in from D1. That‚Äôs just such a little quirks that I don‚Äôt think they would intentionally do
---
Increasing your tier just changes one stat not perks , unless you mean the pvp or pve kill tracker
---
They're both good in their own ways so it's really up to you which one you use. Sunbreaker has melting point and shatter hammers which are really good for dps and striker has really good ad clear and both supers are strong in pvp. Sunbreaker is probably the most well rounded because the super can be used for anything from Killing trash ads to boss dps but striker is a little better in pvp but you can do good with any subclass
---
It is 100% absolutely never going to happen. Literally zero chance.  None. There is no maybe. There are not enough signatures in the world that would make that happen.
---
Yeah, that one. Currently my favorite weapon. Not sure if I should try for rampage/swashbuckler on it instead of multi-kill clip before masterwork, but as it is right now the gun drops enemies so fast it's very satisfying to use.
---
Am I missing something here?
---
truueeee
---
Just a little dark parallel
---
Oh, so what happened? My weapon is worthless now lol. It still has the original perks on the app.
---
It would be a 450 Lightweight, not a 540 Rapid fire.   Blind Perdition was in the same archetype as Hawksaw, Outbreak, Bad Juju, PDX-45 etc.  
---
Although, based on what happened with Luna/NF, it'd be cool if we more endgame weapons with different intrinsic perks.  a 450 RPM pulse with a rapid fire frame would be kinda cool, but I love that Lightweight frame intrinsic so much, especially when combined with Traction.
---
Yup. What he said.
---
Yes, there was an armor rework (armor 2.0) that just dropped with Shadow keep
---
They removed progression. You start off with all abilities and top level
---
Maybe i need a better roll or something
---
They unfortunately just added that for shadowkeep and new light
---
Those 3 strikes don't have matchmaking only the new ordeal playlist and yeah you can do it solo
---
Indeed
---
Yooooooooo
---
Ah you‚Äôre right, I completely forgot lightweight frames were a thing, jeez there‚Äôs so few of them available, pretty much just Nightshade and Chattering none right now isn‚Äôt it?
---
No idea I've never heard of something like that happening
---
I wish they did leave some stuff for new players to work for like seeds of light and middle tree subclass skills
---
If you just cover old loot in leaves you can make new loot with half the work and time!
---
Ya, I kinda wished they made it to where you still had to grind, but I do get why they made it this way.
---
Sorry I couldn't help much
---
Ready to take back what you said, lol
---
No summoning in the summoning pits.
---
All you need is to have previously unlocked the armour.
---
So I've heard, aside from a few strategic additions such as Skolas' ship crash-landed into the Anchor of Light, the widening of the cracks radiating out from the Hellmouth, and of course the Scarlet Keep.
---
Yes, and it annoys the hell out of me.  Blind Perdition (adept) was my all time favorite pulse rifle in D1, and the closest thing I've gotten to it in D2 is Chattering Bone.  
---
My main complaint with D2 is that weapon stats are significantly lower than they were in D1, due to the absence of trade-off perks such as hand laid stock, which is what gave Blind perdition such high stability.
---
It‚Äôs fine lol. First time ive seen anything like this as well.
---
Ware is this
---
Who allowed Commando Pro to be equipped?
---
Will vex offensive ever become available to all forsaken owners like menagerie, forges etc. are currently?
---
Prometheus Lens was so fun when it was first released
---
I lack the funds to do so
---
Risk and reward quest mission
---
She‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever wanted
---
Yes. All specific weapon ammo perks spawn ammo for all weapons of that type you have equipped
---
Well yea but the mods specifically say intellect and stuff, can I justnot use them?
---
plus its an exotic.
---
Interesting I have to try this build later on if I get Monte Carlo.
---
To OP: In addition this is just theory craft on my part as I just thought of it but you can also probably run bottom tree gunslinger with the NightHawk exotic helmet along with masterwork(MW) weapon. However the only benefits this has in pve is being able to do an somewhat immeasurable amount of damage for boss. The idea is to get you super back quick by getting precision hit(kill?) on red bar and low yellow bar. Along with the MW weapon it should not take long can also be shorter if you use armor that has high intellect.
---
Again this is just theory craft as I haven‚Äôt try this myself yet.
---
PvP is sweaty af on this game. It ain‚Äôt no Sunday Drive like the PvE mode is I‚Äôm afraid.
---
You can't retrieve armor or weapons with random rolls only static rolls like the Leviathan raid gear and you don't need forsaken to do this
---
In all honesty, out of every expansion and DLC that we‚Äôve had so far this is the one I‚Äôm the most disappointed with - there‚Äôs just nothing there which really gets me excited. The thing feels like when Disney tried playing the fuck out of the nostalgia card with the new Star Wars trilogy. 
---
Forsaken brought in SO MUCH NEW SHIT that I can‚Äôt even begin to name it all. Black Armory brought a farm for some of the very best weapons ever released. Joker‚Äôs Wild brought in a meh game mode with some new, great guns. Opulence introduced a farming method for weapons which previously were obnoxious to go for and delivered a couple of new, excellent guns. 
---
Shadowkeep? Uh, what‚Äôs here? I genuinely don‚Äôt find that anything they introduced makes me go ‚ÄúI gotta have that right now‚Äù.
---
O that's convenient because I just got the quest step today. Anyway thank you
---
void smg + nezarecs + chaos reach, swap to geomags when you want to super
---
Yeah I wish this wasn't the case since I'm separated from my PlayStation right now. But they'll never leave that money on the table.
---
Easy but repetitive farm is the treasure knight on the moon in the are just right of ‚ÄúSanctuary‚Äù. Killing him creates a bridge that leads to a chest that drops armor and weapons. First goal should be getting to power of 900. Then powerful gear bounties and quests will become available. Don‚Äôt waste infusing your best gear before 900.
---
So in other words, you cry when you lose.
---
I can‚Äôt remember ever having an experience like this in the crucible on Xbox One, probably just because new light players. In fact some matches I‚Äôll get so frustrated because I‚Äôll be trying to get melee kills for a bounty only to die like 3 times in a row not getting a single punch in lol
---
Polaris Lance. I see you are a man of culture as well
---
Hunter?????
---
The last man cannon in that segment of the strike lets you summon your sparrow without the need for rapid summon perks, try it mid-air
---
Yes, but I punch
---
How does having extra functionality on a gun make it worse? Stop being rude and let others enjoy stuff
---
There's a lot of anger in these comments. Why? Why do so many of you bend over backwards to defend lazy work? I don't get it, expect better.
---
That's cool. No more strange coins like D1? How many legendary shards for an engram?
---
Hey, you‚Äôre finally awake
---
You get shards from breaking down purple gear and gunsmith materials from breaking purple, blue and green items, glimmer you get from just playing the game. The mod cubes are for infusing gear to a higher level. Are you on Xbox.
---
how big is it?
---
God damn it, titans aren‚Äôt even the best punchiebois.
---
 M√©s que un club
---
Deathbringer
---
You can infuse it to higher light levels but you can't upgrade it from common gear to rare gear
---
I mean, the dialogue he tells you says you can claim one, but then he simply just doesn‚Äôt
---
Go to Bungie.net and enable cross save to your steam account
---
Sorry about that
---
should make one with a zombie holding a sword
---
Titan simulator
---
Honeymoon period man.
---
I think it‚Äôs around 90 shards for an engram, whereas it‚Äôs around 25 for a featured exotic
---
Nice.
---
Wait for triumph 80085
---
too bad :(, do you think its worth it to start over? And is there anything that i lose besides gear when i make a new character? Thanks man.
---
I don't get it. It looks about as basic and bland as a gun could. Guess it's just not for me.
---
help I don't get it
---
Facehugger Cloak
---
I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs not Nova Bomb
---
Graviton lance and watch them all explode
---
What are you using to punch that much?
---
I‚Äôm not even kidding this exact thing happened to me on a prestige nightfall. It was the final trophy I needed for a Platinum trophy on PS4, on this exact nightfall. I threw a titan pulse and died and the pulse went off as the restart screen was popping up and then he died.
---
Just imagine if we could do this in the crucible, Shaxx would explode
---
Damn why you shootin like that
---
It drives me nuts. I'm not saying this DLC adds nothing new but it definitely doesn't add enough to warrant it's $35 USD price tag.
---
It clips through most hoods, I hate that it‚Äôs become my PvE crutch
---
It‚Äôs fun, I recommend you try it. Top tree arcstrider plus the dodge that gives melee back when you use it near enemies
---
It was answered 20 million other times under this post.
---
It's black garden soo we talkin gjalahorn here
---
top tree arc melee recharges your dodge ability
---
Are you 914 light without the artifact bonus? When engrams drop, they don't count the artifact bonus.
---
Say I buy shadowkeep on pc and am playing it there and my friends want me to play with them on PS4. Can I log into my crossplat character on PS4 and still play shadowkeep of do I get stuck only being able to play the base game on PS4?
---
Yet you still responded with yes
---
For armour, that's your choice.
---
As a general rule of thumb, the better your armour from Y2, the slower you'll be to adopting 2.0 armour. However in the long term it will be better to switch.
---
For weapons, it doesn't matter. There hasn't been any overhaul of weapons, besides the start of season buffs/nerfs. I still use a full loadout of Y2 weapons in general play.
---
Ah you count the quest before the quest as the same. Yeah it took a few hours but you get 2 powerfull drops so it‚Äòs not that badüòÅ
---
PS4? That would be good, could be doing with a hand!
---
You're really makin a big deal out of me just sayin "yep" huh?
---
Which nightfall playlist are you doing it in?
---
I am not sure, I am sorry. I know you got the No Turning Back bow, Memory of Cayde class item, and Vestian Dynasty there, and in the patch notes it says that Vestian Dynasty no longer drops, so unless Forsaken gives legendary items (it never gave exotics), that gun would no longer be obtainable. I'll ask around and see if anyone who is doing Forsaken for the first time knows.
---
Got Traction from Banshee 2 days ago, it does exist !
---
H√§kkler &amp; Koch
---
Unfortunately, Shadowkeep is platform specific. The Season of the Undying pass that came with Shadowkeep is not, though.
---
I main a warlock, I play titan when I want to just run through stuff,  when I play warlock I use last word and badlander,
---
Widow's Court is a great map.
---
YEEEESSSSS GUARDIAN!!
---
Helps to explain why you can barely find more than 3 enemies on screen at a time otherwise.
---
legit the only good mission in all of Osiris but you cant replay it at all as it was account based
---
Ahh so I can keep leveling up my pass but I won't have access to shadowkeep stuff? That sucks coz I would have liked shadowkeep with a bunch of my PS4 friends but I don't want to buy it twice especially since it's more expensive on PSN in my area...
---
Thanks for the info fellow Guardian!
---
I want to try the raid but I'm only 915 lol.
---
Fighting the gatelords solo sucks.
---
Do tell
---
Patch notes:
---
The Power bands for Season 8 are as follows
---
Floor: 750
---
Soft Cap: 900
---
All drops up to this point will be upgrades to the most powerful item in your inventory or vault
---
Beyond this point, only powerful and pinnacle rewards will increase a player‚Äôs Power
---
Powerful Cap: 950
---
All non-powerful/pinnacle rewards are capped at 950
---
Pinnacle rewards are the only way to raise Power above this point
---
Powerful rewards are equivalent to the character‚Äôs highest-equippable Power beyond this point
---
Pinnacle Cap: 960
---
This is the highest Power at which gear drops; also known as the ‚Äúhard cap‚Äù
---
Most raid strategies rely on there being a few people using specific subclasses, mainly the titan top tree void bubble and the warlock middle tree solar. It is technically possible to not do this, however. You can do raids with any class composition if you and your team are good enough at the game and know the raid well. It's just more difficult without combining a buff, debuff on the enemy, and healing/increased reload speed. 
---
You will also notice that some raid encounters just are not very good with certain subclasses. For example, if enemies are  all very far apart and spread out and you have a melee range super. 
---
Guns are also very important. You generally want higher DPS guns for encounters with bosses. You will want to use a special ammo weapon too, don't bring two primaries unless you *really* know what you are doing (for example, specialized strategies like the entire team using the Rat King exotic for boss DPS, so you need another primary gun in order to save on Rat King ammo).
---
Are god rolls or good rolls still listed for y2 and y1 weapons
---
Yeah man the stability is great,  really into it
---
I see the difference that kids got an ornament on that exotic
---
So what your sayimg is to just shard all my old armor unless i like the look of it because you can get the same perkz but by choice now
---
Wouldn't call it clutch , more like the whole gearbox play, GG !!
---
I just beat The Red War legacy quest but I didn't get any of the Ghost Shells that were supposedly in the campaign. How do I get them?
---
yeah, i tried this with my mini sparrow.. lets just say i dropped like a mini rock
---
Before shadowkeep the  bergusia forge is the only place curated weapons drop , there was a forge on nessus where the exotic bow could drop and each forge had it's own specific shader and emblem.
---
now this, this man gets it
---
If I'm not mistaken I believe it is possible to drop from lost sector chests and just random chests
---
It can be a beast when the perk is active..
---
No supers/sword needed. You could probably also just exit and reenter the raid rather than kill yourself in order to spawn into Undergrowth once you have the checkpoint.
---
It's all the random energy mods.  On armor that is randomized, it just randomizes the element that's on it, and by proxy, what mods can be put on it.
---
Some armors come with 4 slots, others with 3, basically.  The 4th slot, so far for me, is only for the Dreambane mod for Shadowkeep.
---
He means masterwork element. Each armour rolls with either arc, solar or void, which changes the different mods which can be applied. Each armour piece can also drop with six different numbers for the stats (intelligence, strength, discipline, resilience, mobility and recovery) intelligence either improves grenade or super recharge rate while discipline improves the other one. Strength improves melee recharge rate. Mobility improves strafe, initial jump height and sprint speed. Resilience improves armour (can take more damage before dying). Recovery improves time before you start healing. You want armour with high stats for the build you want to make. Energy is used to determine how many mods can be inserted into the armour piece, with the more energy for the armour, the mods you can implement. To increase energy, you want to masterwork the armour. However, this is somewhat resource heavy, so don‚Äôt do it on every piece of armour you own. Do it on your god roll armour, with the stats and element you want on it
---
My fav are the earth raids, wrath and scourge
---
I see, thank you for the answer. Even then there is only a small chance that the shader ‚Äúsurvives‚Äù the dismantling, right? I only got a shader once I think.
---
Yup! Used it with Spectral today and holy shit it‚Äôs fun
---
Well it allows me to start it solo,  so I naturally assumed you can do it solo.  Is it because some puzzles require cooperation?
---
I'm the opposite. I'm 90% on multikills, 60% on medals, 30-ish% on final blows. Probably gonna be a few more days until I get my hands on it üò¢
---
If you got it once then you‚Äôre set you can buy till your hearts content.
---
I managed to do this a while ago by jump in towards the portal and riding sparrow at the exact right time and it worked, I did get yeeted off the edge of the map though
---
Oh ok thx. Well i'd prefer solar and i imagine Resilience and Mobility are good.
---
You're breathtaking
---
Finished the questline and still to use it on pvp, yet some very unlucky Fallen roaming on the moon were just removed from the fucking code of the game with those little mininova-bois
---
Oh cool, there's a quest attached to the gun? Been considering getting the season pass, but I was holding off until I could get my gear score up higher.
---
What sort of build do you reckon you‚Äôre going for? Bc if you choose, say a grenade centered build, you can take a 3:30 grenade cool down to 1 minute or less. Also, just out of curiosity, why solar masterwork. I‚Äôm not familiar enough with the system, but from what I remember it has perks that favour bows and auto rifles
---
This is bs! You don't "have to" buy Forsaken üò†
---
It's a random drop from any activities but it's pretty rare (like swords for example) üòî I had waited for a long time to get my first bow, but then, here it finally dropped (from a nightfall strike) =&gt; [https://streamable.com/uzeid](https://streamable.com/uzeid)
---
Still doesn‚Äôt work for me. PS4
---
what quest is that?
---
No Skyrim intro at the end? A missed opportunity
---
My girlfriend gets motion sickness as well, on pc, raising the field of view and making it windowed and smaller seemed to help a bit. It makes her eyes notice the desktop  background and signal to her brain that she isn't actually moving. You could try that if you're on pc.
---
Other than that. Byf has a 4 hour lore video that will go beyond what you'll find out playing the game normally.
---
Moons haunted...LMFAOO!!!XD
---
Yes I know, but in order for it to get in your collection it has to survive the dismantling, otherwise you don‚Äôt have it discovered right? I think I dismantled plenty of stuff with shaders I didn‚Äôt have, and I still don‚Äôt have them in my collection, but I will check next time I dismantle something.
---
Essentially it‚Äôs an anti-fallen weapon and the top weapon for Bergusia and Gofannon forges, everywhere else, Recluse/Calus mini tool
---
True, buy when you and I started we were dropped into red war, then probably CoO, then Warmind, then Forsaken and now shadowkeep. So there weren't that much endgame content and main quest guides you through. There was a lot of discovery and googling, but at least you knew the direction.
---
Now you start with tons of quests no idea what to do and what to Google. Everyone recommending doing main quests, buy why? Power level bump made that content absolete for anything other than story line.
---
ah yeah, I've used that before but the issue is what you've said: its harder to use and you get 9 seconds, probably enough time but it only refills health, doesn't give an overshield..
---
I swear I'm gonna have to adopt my current set up on my Warlock and put it on my Hunter when I get this goddamn exotic... when I actually use the Hunter that is
---
Kill it
---
Don't forget to grab the rice cake from one of the chests near the K1 Crew Quarters to offer to the bunny, you get a decent amount of Phantasmal Fragments.
---
Same.
---
Yeah, this is all I get, too. Legit every run I'll get at least one, usually two. It's fucking annoying.
---
No you are absolutely correct. It's to keep everyone on the same playing field no matter the activity.
---
The same thing happened to me with Zero Hour instead
---
Maybe we have to pull it from collections, it‚Äôs what I did at least
---
I believe the heroic adventures in the vanguard section, near the strikes and nightfalls now count towards it. Ngl, prophecy weapons aren‚Äôt the best weapons. It‚Äôd be more worth your time trying to go after forge, reckoning, menagerie or doing warmind to gain access to the warmind exotic quests
---
Yeah but it's supposed to be a powerful reward from that mission which is why it sucks.
---
They usually Come right after public events
---
2.0 is the new armour system, with Year 3 of D2.
---
EV is Eververse but shortened.
---
Wait like, 5 minutes after a public event and it should happen
---
The amount of shame i feel as a titan..
---
They spawn after public events end.
---
Kore ga "Requiem"....da
---
I smiled when I saw this. I main a titan also.
---
There used to be ways to farm for exotics, not anymore unfortunately. It‚Äôs random. Your best best is to farm the nightfall the ordeal. Also do the risk runner quest from banshee (the gunsmith) which gives a high level risk runner which is a good msg.
---
I'll try that. Thanks.
---
If you're only gonna buy one, start with forsaken. It adds much more in terms of game modes, etc. than shadowkeep currently has.
---
Yeah, they lifted a lot of the look from H&amp;K, with some FN Herstal P90 and stuff tacked on, I think. But that is one nasty looking gun, no question.
---
Thanks man appreciated!
---
What difficulty are you trying to do this on tho, on hero is almost impossible to do unless you're really lucky with circumstances.
---
On legend it shouldn't be too much of an issue
---
I think a lot of people like "real gun" looks.
---
Same here, Bungie pls
---
So simple yet so effective haha, thanks man appreciated!
---
Why, though? It's slow and I don't get what use it has.
---
Same issue. T1 runs on my main Warlock got me Titan gear. Can't try T2 cause I don't have access yet (just started playing again).
---
Most of the Fallen hit you with arc, shield bearing cabal, little hive guys that swarm you and melee and there is always Titan arc grande which you can toss under your foots.
---
That rabbit is out of second chances!
---
Basically the only way to get them is via raids?
---
I wonder about this too.
---
I don't get what the photo is about, but you have my upvote for the MCU refernece.
---
I was just about to post this. The first time I saw it I thought it was a face hugger. Then I thought it was a zipper.
---
I've since settled on saying that I am showing off my zipper emblem.
---
You can try r/fireteams
---
You know you can just spawn the sparrow half way through the launch in the air.. I do it all the time.
---
that is a clever way of getting the sparrow up I'm height tho, kudos...
---
Its spelt primeval but pronounced prime evil. So you technically aren't wrong.
---
As soon as you get a 901 piece of gear for a slot you wont use a blue piece for that slot again. Dismantle them for Gun parts.
---
There is colour blind setting on destiny, but they aren't great, somethings still come up the wrong colour still. But I wouldn't know about the reshade, depends if I whether the anticheat thought it was bad.
---
Just ride backwards, at the right angle it will pull you every time.
---
Dont bother with infusing untill 900+ light
---
After that you could start yo infuse you fav gear But not necessery
---
Also: Beautiful framed Colonel photo.
---
No, you can do the 3 base campaigns and then visit the planets and a few other things. The experience hasn‚Äôt really changed at all.
---
Yes but it's glitched.
---
Bungie hasn't updated the game so it doesn't require ps plus because it shouldn't now that it's a free to play game
---
I didn‚Äôt see crayons I‚Äôm not believing this is a titan.
---
Which exotic with Blade barrage?
---
use -high -USEALLAVAILABLECORES
---
Neutered void gjallarhorn
---
So you‚Äôre telling me I‚Äôve wasted a good handful of upgrade mods? Lol. Thank you!
---
I hope for you your health insurance is covering the aftermath.
---
My favorite gear is probably the weapons just because I ‚Äúuse‚Äù them. Gear seems to be much more passive. What gear should I be looking to upgrade?
---
I remember this so vividly! It was really easy if you went to the glitched spot where you could sit and shoot him without taking damage though.
---
Bungie did a blanket nerf to range to everything and handcannons got the worse of it, especially ace and duke. Not forgotten and austringer with range finder ( any 140 rpm with rangefinder) are the best handcannons now for range nf is better cuz faster ttk. 
---
People begged scouts to be useful so bungie nerfed everything lol.
---
Check out coolguys videos he has a great breakdown of everything.
---
I'm down for helping too. Dm me for my steam if you want.
---
Date/time is set correctly?
---
Also have you tried to reboot? ;)
---
Never laughed so hard when this happened in the movie
---
The fact that it's a toggle contradicts about every other game with a jetpack
---
I kinda figured if you were looking to get into it, you most likely wouldn't appreciate that.
---
Just use dune marchers and code of the missive and insta kill 3 guardians with your ballistic slam
---
You never infuse until you get past the soft cap. Every drop will be higher than the last until that point. Once you get to 901+ gear you only infuse the good stuff you want to keep forever. 
---
Guns with exceptional perks. Armor with high stats. It's a little harder to tell what armor is better to infuse this expansion, though once you figure it out you'll do fine.
---
and i cant find the playlist
---
I've already said "fuck this gun" like a hundred times but god knows I still want it
---
Yeah i would understand that, but im not talking about the raid I mean the 6 man vex invasion instance that Ikora sends you to where the reward is a powerful engram after 3 runs. So would be somewhat lessened if the chests dropped powerful drops as you could just farm those for all your upgrades to 950 as i couldnt see that it has a lock out ?
---
Getting a 100% completion of destiny including collection is a bit of a grind, I'm used to black desert online, destiny is not grindy at all.
---
Check the EDZ map
---
nope. just first light. i was kinda pissed with the new intro bc there was no explanation why the guardian was awoken. that first mission should have stayed in destiny 1.
---
I know that lol. I'm asking if it ever comes back down or resets or does it keep going up infinitely for the duration of the season
---
Ok thx
---
Im not that into min/maxing my Gear so i just upgrade whatever looks good/is decent.
---
You can look into maxing a spesific stat for a spesific build. Like intellect.
---
I think there are guides for that kind of stuff 
---
*for weapons i like to save the ones i like and upgrade them. For example the bow that we got in forsaken first mission reward, im Still using it and used It since i got It.
---
It all depends on preference. Just try to have max amount of light when getting rewards cause they scale on your light ( this might be changed and the game could scan your inv for potential max light, But im not sure on this and just play It safe by having them equipped)
---
No that‚Äôs new. I‚Äôd suggest any new players go immediately to Amanda and start the red war
---
Quest list and markers: Are we a joke to you?
---
It's been confirmed on their road map look it up
---
Shes in the tower, on the right side of the map.
---
i'm not colorblind, but achromate, that is rarest then colorblind, but easiest to implement. So for me colorblind options are useless (and for all players like me that stop playing for the not help from the company)
---
I am become death, destroyer of worlds.
---
Warlock.  Is there a trick to it I'm not getting?  I can glide but that's about it, my double jump doesn't give me any more height.
---
You must be the new guy
---
iirc the Enhanced quest is the adventure about halfway down the street on the left hand side of the church as seen from the transmat arrival spot.
---
P.S. We only use MT/Recluse when we are up against MT/Recluse.
---
Ikora gave me these for a Powerful Reward this weekend.  I haven't switched off of bottom tree yet and have had a blast taking advantage of the 10 second Sunspots.  I am wondering if the invisible Sunspot with other trees is intended or just a bug?  Either way, kinda cool and thanks for pointing it out.
---
I am a hunter and I wholeheartedly agree.
---
That planet with Funny Robot Man...?
---
It blows my mind when people talk about $35 not being worth it when there are new raids, several hours of additional campaign, new strikes, new crucible rotations/modes, new PVE modes, hidden stuff all over, additional stuff to be released over time, etc. Two people going to the movies or a decent dinner once can easily cost over 30 bucks. Aside from games and streaming services, where are you going to spend $35 that will easily give 30+ hours at the very least of entertainment?
---
Oh then maybe try finishing the challenges from shaxx (crucible), zavala (strikes) and ikora, which simply require u to complete some bounties. Hopefully that does it for u
---
Im new on PS4 as well if the offer extends to others!
---
Feels closer to dragon's breath if anything
---
Yep u have to. If u have picked up the quest from spider that led to ada1, the quest should guide u through the steps needed to unlock the forge
---
F
---
Well the homing scatter projectiles feel similar to gjallarhorn. Except it plays wildly different, it's more of a wussy strat. You are encouraged to fire from cover.
---
Basically there are 3 elements, arc (blue), void (purple) and solar (orange). 'elemental' weapons deal extra damage against enemies with an elemental shield so yeah
---
Disappointing this was
---
Can someone please send me the alphabet for this hive lettering?
---
If u really don't want to discover it on your own, just do a quick Google or YouTube on how to find them
---
If you thought this was impressive then y‚Äôall haven‚Äôt seen Sentinel Titans‚Äô melee detonators. I could kill every vex shown here in 1 punch. I AM 1 PUNCH MAN
---
What's really fun about this heavy is that you take absolutely no damage from it whatsoever
---
Had a few scenarios where I bum rushed a room and panic shot at my feet just to accidentally wipe half of a team
---
If anything it's proving never to invest into anything from bungie because they just release it for free.
---
So does that mean if an enemy has a blue shield i can use a ARC (blue) weapon?!
---
Are you trying to do the heroic one?
---
Literally the one exotic hunter armor I don‚Äôt have. I‚Äôm a lil mad about it
---
Ikoras quests u get I forget what its called but it's the kill 3 gate lords at a vex invasion portal on the moon there's 3 areas on the moon where u can go 1 at the fallen ship, hellmouth and the bottom left area on the moon near eris they are rare encounters but I've seen after a public event there they usually spawn right after
---
Enemies such as fallen captains, vex minotaurs, and hive wizards will have a different color shield whenever they are shot at. Captains have arc shields that appear blue, minotaurs have void shields that are purple, and wizards have solar shields that are orange. Weapons that have the same elemental damage as the enemies shield will cause more damage to their shields, but in general any elemental weapon does more damage to shields than a kinetic weapon. Also if you break an enemies shield that is the same element as your weapon, it will cause a small explosion that will stagger them.
---
Shadowkeep's campaign is free. By buying it you get access to all the adventures an nightmare hunts, and I think this season pass too with the vex offensive
---
Spike for pve. Sticky for pvp
---
Riskrunner is better
---
35$ reskin paint job, ttk was way better than this shit dlc
---
Can't reaquire the quest myself. Says i need the "beyond" quest to reaquire the dreambane armor, and of course, can't complete beyond either
---
It's overpowered against fallen
---
Separate :P
---
I am probably one of the worst invaders, ranging anywhere from zero (most common) to a max of three.  Was on my way to number 4 one time (and even got some shots on target) when the Drifter zorched me back.  However, I did finally manage to get the Army of One and I was walking on air for the better part of an hour afterwards.
---
It's sad that they nerfed it, it was a good AR when it came out, without being completely broken.
---
Once you set up cross save you have to stay in the same clan accross all platforms, Kind of annoying since my clan on PS4 is full and on PC we have 5 members...F :(
---
Currently in the process of forcing everyone in my clan onto PC :)
---
First ,   it‚Äôs a great add  clear weapon,  my second favorite after recluse.
---
You can load up a nightfall and either run that or once you load in if there is a lost sector nearby just go run the lost sector over and over.  Those kill counts
---
Also, if you have 1k it is also a fusion rifle so you can use it to get kills if you run out of ammo in your energy weapon
---
If you are still below 900 Power level the campaign missions should still give random blue drops that are higher Power than your current gear. Basically you can do anything you want to get to 900 Power level, all blue/purple/gold engrams from enemies, chests, post match rewards, etc. will give you a Power boost. After that is when the real shooty-looty gameplay loop kicks in and you will be directed to more specific goals via the Destinations/Map tabs depending on what content you own.
---
Ahh that might be the reason
---
Can I do this solo?
---
In sane
---
Seriously, at least res the guy
---
Separate
---
I‚Äôve been running Ikelos as my shotgun 
---
Haven‚Äôt found anything I like better based on my personal play style even though it doesn‚Äôt hit super hard
---
Nop, u have to pay separetely for forsaken and than shadowkeep
---
Boosting while in midair makes it faster
---
I'll keep that in mind I'm thinking of grinding that out today
---
Start with forsaken campaign then do Shadowkeep campaign .  This way you don‚Äôt get spoilers by playing the other content
---
Saaame
---
I did mine in solo nightfalls. Took just a few runs of arms dealer to be done with the whole quest
---
No its not
---
I feel completely lost, and it does not help that i need Playstation plus for strikes and crucible, the fact that we enter right into what is basically the end game is a bit overwhelming and i have no idea who is who because i don't know the story
---
Increased power = ability to do harder activities and still do damage.
---
If the Red War missions are still out there, (don't know if new light has that or not since I've been in since day one) you can earn good Exotics through those. Doomfang, Armamentarium for Titan. I don't remember the other class exotics through the story. But Graviton Lance, Sunshot, and Riskrunner can all be monsters when used right and use primary ammo. Graviton does high damage, no falloff, and causes enemies to blow up in a void explosion. Sunshot shoots explosive rounds and causes enemies to blow up. Riskrunner chains lightning when hit with Arc damage and reloads itself on kills while active. They were rewarded through story quest on Io. As for a full armor set, a planetary set can be bought for materials. You have options for most planets. I like the Nessus sets, personally.
---
Go to where all the nightmare ogres spawn and you can farm phantasmal cores to buy the quest again
---
The depth and breadth of knowledge contained in the developers at Bungie never fail to impress.  Good catch and it is not often you come across someone who has read Dickinson, let alone instill it into a video game.
---
As a hunter main, D1 had waaaay nicer cloaks than D2 has. I think there's only like, 2 or 3 so far in D2 I like compared to a ton in D1.
---
Oh okay I will check later on, thank you!
---
So if I'm not doing any harder activities, it's largely pointless me doing it? How does that tie in with the fact that gear does more damage as you level up and get stronger generally? I'm basically trying to figure out what I need to do to increase damage, if that's even possible. I just don't understand and haven't ever looked into it before
---
Once you complete the main quest (and I think secondary quest), you may gain access to weapon quests (blue banners with a crown on the map). They give you access to a series of missions, at the end of which you earn an exotic weapon. Those exotic weapons (MIDA, Rat King, Sturm,...) can only be obtained through those missions.
---
How do people find stuff like this? This is crazy
---
How do I start the Forsaken story campaign?  I've done the Red War and both expansions.
---
I love vaulting all my gear at the beginning of an expansion and starting from scratch until I get to pinnacle activities again. There's only so much I can use recluse without getting bored.
---
I did help some other guardians kill it at least 3 times but that‚Äôs it, so hopefully it‚Äôs in my collections
---
Also the Sole Surivor with Firing Line is insane dmg, more than DARCI I think.
---
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre going to see cross play until next major expansion or even Destiny 3. The coordination that has to take between platforms is massive.
---
Take. Your. Time. 
---
Seriously. 
---
Take Eriana‚Äôs Vow and Fine Memorial. Primary of choice. 
---
Clear the rooms until you get to about 20~ seconds on the song, then jump up to a platform and 2-tap the wazard. Any damage interrupts the song. A Fine Memorial is really good for clearing, Erianas is beautiful for popping shields. 
---
Continue clear, repeat until room clear, murder wazard. 
---
Repeat for all wazards. 
---
Got it done at 900 power. The first few times the minute timer panicked me and I tried to rush the wazard. Every time I made it to room 2 and the combined fire of the rank and files would put me down. Decided I was gonna try ‚Äúone last time‚Äù, took it slow, nailed it flawlessly.
---
If you are overpowered in total light, it only goes up so much before it becomes pointless. But a higher weapon means higher total power and higher level enemies can be hurt more.
---
Of cousre because you have to aim above the enemys head for it to be most effective
---
Shadowkeep will have a lot more content in the future. But Forsaken has a lot of content rn. So I'd say Forsaken 4 the moment
---
Well it's not like the game explains that kind of stuff.
---
Yeah. More styles it seemed like.
---
Dont worry guys I fixed it by unlinking and linking my account. I have no idea why this worked now but Im thankful it did. This game is weird man
---
Nope
---
The only thing that Zhalo did better was you not having to take arc damage to get your chain lightning
---
They have been pretty successful so far.  Thank you shady or ignorant politicians!
---
Okay, thank you! So say, for example, I'm just running around titan or something, increasing weapon power will do nothing because I'm already overpowered for that destination but if I play other, more difficult modes I'll see an increase in damage?
---
Just in case you misinterpreted, he meant use one slot for a weapon that uses special ammo (green) and not run 2 primary ammo weapons.  The special ammo weapons (shotgun, sniper, fusion rifle, etc) hit harder than primary.  They can be blue, legendary, or exotic
---
Lol. Just go watch the original YouTube video where he got this from. It goes more in detail.
---
Forsaken only (or possibly also with Shadowkeep, it says either/or on the class trees). Definitely not included with New Light though.
---
i love it but its so very situational. its good in the leviathan raids whem you are defending the standards and in cabal strikes. other than that there are so many better weapons i could use to get kills.
---
I said that after the breakneck quest line. Took me months to go back.
---
I can understand your view, but I like supporting Bungie directly now.  I love my Haymaker finisher.
---
It's a sign from God to tell you to not buy Microtransactions
---
It‚Äôs also great in the GoS final boss fight
---
Like just now i got a quest do the ascendant challenge bounty. What the fuck is that? I don't see anything on the planet or on the map itself.
---
Huckleberry + catalyst is probably the best gun in the game right now. At least for PC. It's absolutely broken OP.
---
I would ship it
---
They honestly should put quest markers on important NPCs, like the one's for the main storyline and major side quests.
---
It was where they said it was. I went to Mercury and had to do vex crossroads next. It‚Äôs kinda complicated and I failed miserably. Still haven‚Äôt finished lol
---
bruh this is a repost
---
Zhalo, Loaded Question and Wendigo GL3. Fallen's worst nightmare.
---
You tell me bro. I preordered the whole year, so far so good. It‚Äôs a shame I can‚Äôt convince my friend to buy the pass either. 
---
And for me that‚Äôs what should support bungie, not the MTX. But no point fooling myself, people spend more there so they won‚Äôt go away anytime soon.
---
I only needed around 4 hours to get to fabled
---
Wasn‚Äôt  the great disaster also called burning lake? Whatever it was called, Wei Ning died there, who was hailed as the greatest Titan in history since Saint-14, and was considered a Shoe in successor to the current Vanguard.
---
this event again for the third time... sure not boring yaay...
---
Thanks again, I was playing it last night and hope to finish it tonight. Been enjoying the game a lot since I stopped playing shortly after launch.
---
True salvation
---
RR?
---
No, I want vex mythoclast, this season is all about the vex god damnit bring it back!
---
The whole point is get people watching YouTube videos so they can use the YouTube influencers as free advertising, everyone dislikes it but there‚Äôs no loss doing quests like that whereas there‚Äôs a fair amount to gain on Bungie‚Äôs end
---
You can summon sparrow when ya above it and drive into it
---
Played D2 at launch, but the only gameplay I ever saw of D1 was of the original gameplay demo back when that came out, from when Peter Dinklage still voiced the Ghost.
---
So for me, playing the "new" tutorial after making a new character was a very strange feeling. I was almost certain I'd seen the map before, but I couldn't figure out why. I looked it up after I reached the Tower and it all made sense.
---
Wow thanks a bunch, i highly highly appreciate, ill just opt for it as last thing to do for now, im enjoying tbe game waay too much to let this kill my excitment to play,at worl just thinking when will i get home to hop onto destiny. 
---
Thanks so much i appreciate the empathy and understanding rather than just flaming my experience as being "bad"
---
I came here to request that.
---
Ayyy that's what I like to hear!!!!
---
Riskrunner
---
they had to make the game f2p, obviously what they are doing isn't the best.
---
For casual players, the "quests" are way too dense and assume a level of knowledge that just isn't reasonable.  Pulling them into a "Quest" tab is a good start, rather than mixing them into the inventory, but more filtering is needed on the tab in order to sort through the various activities required. Also, more map markers are needed.  Too much is left vague that doesn't need to be.
---
I thought of that and accounted that the 912 Adhorative pulse rifle had come from that. as it was 3 levels above my level.   
---
Either way glad im not going mad, i am reassured that my understanding of the system is broadly right and this is a touch weird.
---
You must click Authenticate on the other platform
---
Dude I was so confused. Haven't played since D1 and thought for a good 5 minutes "wtf? I guess I've already played this game..."
---
I just killed the spider once and got the khvostov
---
I figured out that the highest any piece of gear can drop is at 54.  Cause if you slap a mod on it, it boosts 1 stat by 10, bringing it to 64, and when you masterwork it, it gives +1 to each stat, for a total of +6 overall, raising it to 70
---
And the artifact mod that gives u overshield on a arc melee ability
---
Thanks guardian!
---
Hmm, did you check the catalyst slot on the item? Otherwise it sounds like it bugged for you.
---
There's no point, riskrunner is essentially the same if not better
---
Chances are the scarlet keep is going to be the new dungeon.
---
This may be a stupid question, but how do I start the Risk/Reward mission?
---
Pretty sure it requires play station plus
---
Usually just jumping up walls and trying to get over them, or questioning "can I get over there" or "what happens if I climb this and jump that" type of thing. I found a way to get under the first raid encounter within the first few mins of the raid launching because I wanted to see if I could get on the weird ring thing lol. But a lot of prior knowledge of other glitches too helps tbh
---
Shaders are now one time consumables
---
Works for me.  Just bought the 1000 (+100) pack earlier today on Steam for the season pass.
---
Gambit Prime is 2% per with the 3x boost.
---
Yeah just got it nuts.
---
Weapons get a tracker after you upgrade the Masterwork slot to tier 6.
---
There are very very many depending on what you want to do. For example, I just started and plan to focus mainly on using Devour on a Voidwalker Warlock to continually spam grenades while regening health. To that end my first priority was the exotic helmet Nezarec's Sin since that gives you ability energy back for every void kill (so grenade, gun, melee, etc kills give energy to my grenade, melee, and class ability). Next I need a good set of void weapons to pair with this so that it will constantly be triggering. I have my sights set on the exotic pulse rifle Graviton Lance since it's void and causes killed enemies to also trigger void explostions, but since that's a random drop I'm making do with whatever void weapons I have as well as the Riskrunner exotic submachine gun which, while arc instead of void, regens super energy.
---
So you pick the thing you want to do, pick the subclass, then build kit around it/relevant exotic weapons and armor. All in all it's not something you need to worry about at all just starting off since your goal is to reach the power cap, but it's something to be thinking about as you near 900. Assuming you just started, play with each of the 3 subclasses and their respective trees for your character to get an idea what you want to do and then snoop around the internet to find gear you should be chasing to accentuate that.
---
BTW,
---
The exotic catalysts work as trackers for exotics
---
The OG d1 gun is in collections? Holy shit I gotta get that. Thought I had to delete my hunter or something.
---
Here at destiny, much like Skyrim with walls, 100% is more a... ‚ÄúSuggestion‚Äù than the actual thing
---
No worries dude! I was in that boat once, I know the feeling all too well. Theres no rush to do crucible, you'll be missing out on a couple of powerful rewards but one or two won't be missed. Truth be told it took me a few months to actually get into crucible, and even now its it's always "Urgh I've gotta do PvP". But it's not *That* bad once you've had some more experience in it
---
Weeeeeeeeee
---
Don't make a post if you don't know shit
---
Yep that did it. Cheers for the reply.
---
I believe the app does, but whether the game allows it depends on the game itself. It didn't recognize any inputs from the default "touch controller" set up (hence why I had to set up the d-pad buttons to register as w-a-s-d instead).
---
I think any bluetooth enabled controller should work with a phone, but I'm not entirely sure, I never use it for truly playing.
---
Cool thanks
---
Does not compute is pretty good as well...I crit for 71 with it
---
Still might be the same problem if you haven't completed curse of osiris and warming
---
Thanks for u/ [Grid\_Lockkun](https://old.reddit.com/user/Grid_Lockkun)  for the idea
---
Nothing like a little anti-semitism to get people to support you.
---
/s
---
Ya imagine having a controller teammate throwing your comp just bc he duos w a pc friend. Or trying to play vs all pc cause of shit matchmaking
---
It is. As a year 0 player who has been really back and forth since reaching 300 light was the soft cap, trying to get back into D2 since forsaken came out but was unable to, shadowkeep has really been refreshing. Armor isn't useless now when it comes to rolls, meaning you can mix and match your style and your build really nicely. Not only that, but it just feel much more populated. Because of the F2P aspect, as well as all the returning players. Only downside? The initial load. Main screen loading has grown longer, but is merely a symptom of a much larger playerbase.
---
That is Shadowkeep forsaken is the tangled shore

1- Like I said in an earlier reply that you seem to have ignored: destiny is not going to always hold your hand with waypoints. There is enough information on bounties and items that you can find the ascendant challenge without looking at a guide. How do I know? Because I found my first one complete by accident. 
---
2- destiny is a multiplayer game. Some quests will require you to do group activities. Deal with it.
---
I'm having issues with the game crashing about once an hour or two. I know my machine can handle the game at 50fps with a hybrid of medium and high settings. I have it capped at 30 fps on low settings and still get constant crashes. I did the most recent GeForce update with a clean install as well.
---
Good job
---
Yeah it's not appearing on my playstation itself but I'll have a look on my ipad
---
Eh, campaign wise D1 was the same. Really no trouble at all, especially if you play with people.
---
What show is this
---
Yeah ik on warmind atm that's why I was wondering where to get the next one
---
Oh, I see.
---
You get a seasons worth of content?
---
gud gaem
---
Gotta have season pass.
---
Just use anti barrier rounds on an AR or sub machine gun and just shoot through their shield.
---
Fair enough
---
Gotcha
---
Three pages of quests and bounties on your first day of playing. This game is not designed for new players.
---
Not that I am aware of.  I have had lvl 1s drop in the mid 40s and as high as about 60.  I am keeping things with good Mobility/Resilience for PvP and Resilience/Recovery for PvE.  If doesn't have a good mix, I do not keep it.  If it has a good mix, I look at the base number compared to my other pieces to determine if it is better or worse than what I have.
---
Hello, in the gambit quest the Drifter isn‚Äôt showing up on the map. Is there anything i can do to make hip show up? I‚Äôve done the quests until that point and i have played gambit a bit. What can i do?
---
But it "worked"? I cant even select a character. It shows im using a standard controller layout but Destiny thinks im still using mouse/keyboard.
---
Heresy on the highest level
---
I may be out of the loop - Is the Riskrunner bad or something?  
---
I've been using it all day and I love it.
---
I did the quest both for the Catalyst AND to get Riskrunner at 900 power so I didn‚Äôt have to use resources. 
---
Also Riskrunner is one of my favorite weapons so it was a win-win.
---
The new risk runner is fun to use, though.
---
Hong Kong is pretty beautiful.
---
I knew what you meant if its any consolation.
---
For others, he's saying people who haven't gotten the boss clear might have a 0% chance at armor because the game checks for the clear.  We've confirmed the chest drops armor, but so far we've only seen reports of armor gained after doing the first encounter, and no reports of armor from cheesing to the chest without killing the boss.
---
So the only relevant data to report would be if you've gotten armor without clearing the boss.
---
Does that LW chest drop powerful gear by chance?
---
Not hard to get, just not that many of them
---
Unless bungo messed with the rewards but they more then likely would have told us that
---
I think my travelers chosen is illegal now
---
*Angry warlock noises*
---
Good
---
But west of sunfall 7 (which im 99% sure is optative og) is a 180 precision frame too, like trust, service revolver, and lunas nf before change, and suffer no recoil....
---
Now my memory of using the gun is hazy (2 years ago now) but the achetype didnt change, and its the same as all the other precision frames
---
I feel this
---
I mean I play warframe too with my friends a lot  but since destiny is free we do more destiny partly. I just find it sad that I have thrown more than 150‚Ç¨ into destiny and dlcs and all I get is a season 1-7 pass. Mind you now it's season 8
---
I'll quit.  Flat out delete and never look back
---
why didnt you keep shooting coulda got the third guy
---
The new rocket launcher is easy enough (Deathsinger), just the mission with the death song might be a bit challenging (although I managed to do it without dying, a machine gun in your power slot does wonders).  
---
Ace of Spades is a PVP handgun that takes some work, but doesn't need anything done in a group. Same for the other PVP weapons (Last Word off the top of my head).
---
Riskrunner is an AMAZING arc smg you get basically for free just doing the Pain and Gain/Risk and Reward quest, catalyst included. Definitely do that, imo it's the best energy exotic weapon on any mission that features a decent amount of arc damage (Any fallen, taken, and imo hive-heavy missions).  
---
You can get a few exotics from playing the Red War* campaign on separate characters (some armour for each, although I think only Titans get an actually good piece - and a choice of Riskrunner/Graviton Lance/Sunshot iirc, I'd choose Graviton Lance and then Sunshot since you can get Riskrunner in another quest now).  
---
The Eriana's Vow handgun you get from the season pass feels good as well, if you can land headshots.  
---
Those are all off the top of my head, at least for the solo ones. I'm currently working on Outbreak Perfected with my group, cause we're all pretty bad with jumping puzzles - if you dislike those you'll have a hard time with both Outbreak and Whisper of the Worm.
---
Nice lol. I got a catalyst and 3 exotics the first couple days. I figured it was because I didn‚Äôt play much in September.  Supposed drop rate goes up if you don‚Äôt play for a while
---
Yeah. I've been playing since day 1. Bought every expansion as it came out. Now? I'm just happy it's on steam and I can finally shift to PC.
---
It‚Äôs alright I probably should have worded my original comment better so it wouldn‚Äôt have led to this
---
This will sound like a stupid question but where is this area where the video starts?
---
Did you even read OPs full comment?
---
Power level affects both damage dealt and taken.  There is a point of diminishing returns with this. 
---
Damage Taken:
---
If you are much lower than an NPC they can one shot you. As you get closer to their level they do less damage to you per shot.  If you are above them by more than 10-15 points they still damage you but  not at much.
---
Damage Dealt:
---
If you are much lower than the NPC they will be immune to you.  As you get closer to their level you do more damage and can kill them quicker.  If you are more than about 20 points higher you cap out on the damage you do.
---
So if you have on 800 gear doing a 750 nightfall, you will find it much easier than when you were 750.  So wear what ever you want.  But if you want to do that 920 nightfall (counts for two completions, by the way), you are gonna want to put on that higher gear even if it has less than stellar traits.  The higher light will make more of a difference than the variance in the traits.
---
Domt you know? Elon found the traveler and convinced it to come to earth with a lucrative RnD project.  10 years later guardians popped up
---
I had a similar idea but increasing the melee type weapons. I want to be able to wield giant axes, bowstaffs, nunchucks or scythes. Making the weapons multiple hits and in different slots is a good idea but changing 3rd person to 1st person is more game engine based I think.
---
Thanks, I'll start with the campaigns :)
---
Ye im also happy that I get to play with my friends and I don't have to be playing alone anymore. I never had the chance to do nightmare strike because I never had a group to play with. But still. I feel like I got ripped off.
---
I also have some 0 light armor as well
---
2 things, 1. Unlimited ammo would break the game, instead of that it could be a 30 second cooldown for 10 seconds of usage and a higher ammo value would result in a lower cooldown 2. Swords should stay in heavy at least right now because of how powerful they are when powered up, although with changes I suggest a separate sword slot
---
I don't know what's going on it's been happening for my friends too. One of them got the ace of spades catalyst and the Cerberus +1 catalyst within an hour of each other. He is loving that Cerberus with the catalyst btw says it's like a shotgun that uses primary.
---
They really outdid themselves with debatable helmet designs this season ( i would have said ugly but.... your mileage may vary)
---
Ye:)
---
You‚Äôre lookin at it all wrong! You got to visit one of caydes hidey spots :)
---
That‚Äôs the real reward...
---
I did it for Khvostov, Arcadia Jumpship, and the Ghost shell
---
Tends to happen.  Best of luck though bro
---
That is why you cannot finish this.  You have to go to the lecturn to get the weapon.  Complete the story missions.
---
Edit:  I think you have to have Shadowkeep to do this. I do not think you can complete that weapon with F2P.
---
Yea, I honestly haven't even opened the Crucible section of my director yet, been too busy with PvE. I don't remember seeing any changes to these rewards, but it is entirely possible I missed come change in all the patch notes.
---
Barrier hobgoblins were evil incarnate, that 2 tap from the other side of the map :/
---
Not sure then
---
*shrug* this ain't D1 anymore
---
I realize later that my question was bad stated, but your answer help me!
---
Thanks for answering &lt;3
---
Wait this is hilarious LMAO
---
Ya, Cerberus is what I got, fireteam member got Ace. Maybe they turned easy mode on those lol
---
That joke is played out already. You're late.
---
Maybe next summer. But that's all for now.
---
Really? I'm sitting at a pretty 3000 atm because I waited for my best bud to play through shadowkeep.   Freelance playlist is like.,. Free glory.  Honestly it's insane. And fun as hell too
---
I cant really remember i think it is the three first keys is volundr, gofannon, izanami.
---
After that you get the key mold with the lenses and stuff. Might be wrong but...
---
I mean, I use 160% and it still looks kinda bad
---
And for some reason, anti aliasing looks the same when its off and when its on SMAA
---
Bungie said that if all your rolls come up 0 then you have to reset your character. (Start all over)
---
Cool
---
I quested all the way through with 2 people doing the same stuff and somehow they still missed 2 quests.

i got wavesplitter when all i wanted was peregrine greaves
---
Also, if you are a Free player I believe you can't access to Izanagi's burden quest, it's part of the exotics quest that free light players doesn't have access :/ but i'm not really sure about this
---
It's the trials of the nine armor without the shoulder spikes and my clanmate told me which colors he wanted so I slapped them on there.
---
So you mean last Tuesday?
---
And does anyone know what some cool hunter armor ornaments are or like a way I can meme my hunter look cool
---
I‚Äôm not sure you tried to day 1 raid sir
---
Welp
---
It's the old trials of the nine set
---
Maybe you just need to play the superior class
---
same.....feelsbad.jpg
---
His will is not his own after all

nice throw

Hahahaha still funny. F the haters. The best part is, it's not cayde. Nathan Fillion is what I see doing this LOL.
---
To clarify, only world loot not stuff like Jotunn right?
---
NEVER ENOUGH PUNCH.
---
I can't stand the size of our shoulder pads.
---
Like I said I didn‚Äôt buy Shadowkeep
---
Oh the bitch slap class
---
I mainly play hunter tho
---
I'm fairly certain when the blueberries see a matchmaking enabled activity the 2 brain-cells that they have just up and leave. Ah well the only tracks in the sand are mine again I guess
---
Thank you! I've heard of discord before but have never used it, I'll check it out!. Also, what's a LFG website?
---
Brilliant, thank you!
---
I'm on Xbox, but thanks for the offer!
---
It all makes sense now thanks for pointing me in the right direction.
---
I just started back up with shadow keep and planned on grinding for it. Tbf I do understand people complaining. The undisputed best gun in the game requires you to play competitive pvp. Some people just want to play pve
---
Ah, I'm on Xbox :/ thanks though!
---
Yeah, I've been trying to for hours to see if something can triggered or find solution asking about here. I found one post with same issue but no solution.
---
Word, thanks for the thoughtful response!
---
So you will Not care but recently i found a pervert build
---
First off you need a void warlock with the top Mastery then you need Contraverse Hold and montecarlo, play on your artifact the mods that enemys in granades are are weakend and blind the Trick is melee will Charge your granades and monte Carlo your granades and i love IT üòÅüòÅüòÅ
---
*Vex Offensive but it's Offensive Vex that scream slurs at you*
---
Yea your right I‚Äôve had it done before Shadowkeep I‚Äôm just trying to see if the old steps are working, clearly they‚Äôre not
---
Which is really dumb if you do want to keep playing Destiny and buy the season pass.
---
There is one spot that I know that I been doing for 2 years with friends on io it's funny to when you go moch 10 into the side of a cliff
---
I‚Äôve been a titan for most of D1 and 2 but sick of them being overused. So what class do you recommend for both comp pvp and all pve content? I don‚Äôt have time to grind my warlock and hunter so who is a preferred choice for a mix of all content? Any other tips for getting back into the game?
---
This is a good post.
---
Lfg is basically looking for group where there‚Äôs loads if you google it
---
I got the greaves, so yea
---
Yeah I‚Äôve come to terms with it, the game is still fun when you don‚Äôt have friends tbh, just can‚Äôt really do some higher level activities like raid (I know there are places where you can find fireteams but 9/10 times you‚Äôre gonna get someone who ruins it)
---
Lmao best comment
---
I literally didn't even buy the pass, I just felt the mission was difficult
---
You forgot: Yeah I was building said ladder but it took me more time than others. I was busy with other chores some didn't have and I couldn't finish it in time and now the cake is spoiled.
---
Pro tip: pop their head off first, then follow it with a precision body shot. 
---
Once their heads gone, they don‚Äôt regen. :)
---
Second encounter is probably my favorite encounter in all of destiny 2 tho. I wish they did more vehicle segments
---
It's in your name, I wouldn't doubt that
---
Best hunter armor ?
---
I'm glad it was Riskrunner.... I've been RNG-ING the catalyst for over a year :(
---
Imagine subtly complaining about the Recluse in the current sandbox..
---
Yep. I put the 2 together when I first played with Erianas Vow. The bonus on precision is what makes this one very strong too but that shield piercing it has really made it for me.   
---
Now I have that on one of my fav new guns to use, Arc Logic. You have a shield? Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha that's cute.
---
Right, that's what I was wondering. No one seems to have an answer to that. Festered Core has no unique item assigned to it far as I can tell. Odd, since every other nightfall does.
---
I had this exact same problem coming from xbox to steam. One solution is to use chrome incognito browser to do that authentication.
---
I personally had to use my iPhone and go in from safari to authenticate. Might be possible if you have android.
---
If that doesnt work, i would recommend getting in contact with bungie help but idk
---
Why does the in-game store take me to to the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù forsaken DLC instead of the complete collection which costs -50%? Is it okay if I buy the collection? (I only have the base game/new light)
---
Headshots
---
Not enough like buttons to agree with this personally but yes nothing really beats how fun that is time and time again
---
Did some looking around and found a fourth found 5
---
Hasn't Crucible always been stupid anyway? I can't remember a single time when it wasn't a broken and unbalanced mess.
---
If anything being easier is a godsend because it means people who don't actually want to subject themselves to it for great lengths of time no longer have to in order to get some stuff they want. So they can just bail out and the people that actually enjoy it (for whatever reason I can't understand) are free to stick around.
---
You don't have to start over, it's the risk/reward quest that gives you riskrunner I think
---
You can't.
---
Done all this, nothing is working :(
---
I just finished up the intro mission on destiny 2 a few minutes ago, last time I played was destiny 1 years ago. Same experience, super confused, came here looking for answers. I wasn't sure if D2 was just a remake of the original, or if I'd downloaded the wrong game or what.
---
There was a whole controversy around it I don‚Äôt know what to tell you! It is reskinned from eververse! What‚Äôs the 90% then? The hunts, the raid and the dungeon? Definitely not 90% and the story isn‚Äôt worth while. You clearly enjoy Shadowkeep and that‚Äôs cool but I‚Äôm just saying that without buying it I got half the content. Let it go
---

The Red war, curse of osiris, and warmind campaigns are apparently at Amanda in the hanger in the tower.
---
They drop from engrams and you can buy them. It's solely cosmetic.
---
Makes me glad I got my sniper during jokers wild dlc. That things a beast plus the catalyst makes it sweeter.
---
Yea that happened to me twice..it's fun to do that but also sucks
---
oppressive darkness mod for the win so you dont necessarily need overload rounds.
---
its gonna be fun though
---
In a perfect world all pinnacle weapons would be raw af. But I guess crucible pinnacle weapons just channel some dark magic because in order for it to be crucible themed, it needs to kill good, which incidentally makes it top tier in PVE as well.
---
I have that one on my warlock as well. Two of my favorite emblems in the game tbh.
---
Just easy. Comps always been stupid.
---
That's really weird..I have no idea dude. I hope somebody can figure it out for you.
---
D1, dark below
---
I think I saw something about the first mission being playable this weekend (maybe extending beyond?) and the moon being open for non-Shadowkeep players. I was trying to Google it, but not seeing anything at first glance.
---
It doea. But if youre looking for most cintent...
---
Thanks for this. It's silly that you have to claim something to complete it. I did this Nightfall several times with no idea of how to complete it. Ridiculous that Bungie doesn't make this clear enough. I did not know you could claim Triumphs.
---
You can infuse gear to increase its level. Doing so requires a piece of gear from the same slot of higher level and an upgrade (core? You get them from Banshee-44) 
---
If you dismantle it, a random drop is the only way to get it back. However, the next drop probably won't have the same perks.
---
It was powerful for me (only +1) and gave the catalyst which was my white whale from strikes. I'm happy about it.
---
It doesnt seem to be really be any meta auto rifles, except maybe breakneck but man thats a grind, so i am ok with that. Im all PVE so care more about fun then meta
---
dude...the SCORN are DEF servants of the blood god. check those helmets.

Yeah, you can get armour ornaments, sparrows, ghost shells, shaders, emotes, weapon ornaments, and i think transmat effects. I may have missed something, but in general it‚Äôs only cosmetics
---
Hahhahahaahahhaaahah
---
If you dont understand something use youtube. Pro tip
---
Nope. I think they have to be with you (not in vault)
---
For hunters it‚Äôs the fishnet exotic helmet
---
Oh sweet
---
The Space Romans one had me geekin ngl
---
It‚Äôs ugly though, like really ugly
---
Yes, and by that I mean it‚Äôs incredibly possible to have fun with no raids, I don‚Äôt play them either
---
In the final assault in November
---
Yeah ik its really weird and i hope someone can figure it out
---
welp, is it useful at all?
---
If you love PvP then I say yeah
---
Yeah very useful, every melee kill turns you invisible for a bit
---
I guess try to think of the opening mission as a reprise or the D1 one and taking place before the D2 campaign? Then the tower gets destroyed and rebuilt during the campaign. It loses some story consistency, but that‚Äôs a small price to play for a more accessible first mission for new players
---
When I heard destiny was free to play I hopped on for the first time since destiny 1 when i played that mission i at first assumed we got to replay the entire first games story within destiny 2 for some reason (was high) and when that wasn‚Äôt the case I was pretty disappointed
---
Oh damn thats good
---
Yeah
---
It‚Äôs officially an ascended meme
---
For the record: my wireless 360 controller perfectly on Destiny 2 when directly plugged into the PC.
---
I know this is not directly helpful, but thought it will help narrow down the problem, which seems to be with the Steam Link.
---
Fabled prior to Shadowkeep definitely took a lot of people more than 8 hours so I‚Äôd say you‚Äôve done great. I think this is the first recluse step I‚Äôve seen that has the glory before the wins üòÑ
---
No it‚Äôs still available to get as always
---
Since there are 9 potential subclasses (and 3 trees within each) I think it‚Äôs too complex to break down here. But Titan, Hunter and Warlock fall into the Fighter, Rogue, Mage archetype respectively. If you want more detail on specific subclasses there are loads of YouTube videos from launch explaining them better than we could do here
---
You csnt mstchmake for heroic you gotta lfg
---
Spider is currently selling helium for glimmer :/
---
^
---
Get some friends together and tell them
---
You gotta kill him so they wont
---
Bungies have implemented the "contest mode" for worlds first meaning that having a high light level means nothing during worlds first, so I am in agreement with op there shouldn't be a high light requirement for worlds first since there's no advantages for having a high light level to begin with.
---
I was pretty excited to see i got the clip down lol
---
they reskinned the pricetag.
---
Erida's Vow might break their immune...
---
I haven't tried it tho
---
What is that helmet from? IT IS GORGEOUS
---
TOUCH DOWN!
---
Someone on Destiny is going to be a Heisman winner if he keeps this up.
---
Ever since we have gotten random rolls back people have been asking for forge weapons to be randomly rolled. Bungie literally did what a ton of people were asking for.
---
I can only imagine lol also I should know this by now I do YouTube as a side thing!! Lol
---
Its showing $59.99 on xbox for me
---
Exactly, and I've been struggling to find the cause because it screwed me over several times in Ordeal and Gambit
---
Don't think it's heat throttle, not RAM issue and Destiny 2 uses the GPU instead of integrated GPU
---
Pretty sure the darkest day emblem is not attainable.
---
You can‚Äôt use the card with ordeals, it‚Äôs not what it‚Äôs for. I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre going for the 100k, you have to do the master ordeal to be able to do that.
---
Not released yet
---
Jump up to where you came in and just unload on him.

Warlock Transmog helm
---
I absolutely love how all armor can be relevant now
---
*You will never reach Truth*
---
It can either drop from xur or a random powerful/world drop :)
---
Don't worry it RNG(Random Number Gernerated) so it just luck, good luck and have fun playing.
---
Ah...then is there a road map?
---
Is your power plan on max performance? Are you gaming with laptop plugged in? Also, use msi afterburner to monitor temps.

Gambit is easy. Kill mobs, deposit motes in center. Kill blockers in center. Kill invaders before they kill you. Invade them. Bank enough motes to summon boss. Kill boss
---
OK so you don\`t want cruicible pinnacle weapons to be good in pve and vise versa, gotcha, nothing wrong with that.  
---
I kind of like it though, I enjoy pvp the most so if I can bring those weapons into pve when I want to it\`s great for me, for practise.  
---
All i tried to say was that you don\`t need to go into the crucible and get the Recluse because there are other options out there which is as good and better for different pve situations.  
---
Riskrunner for instance is one that can outperform Recluse in many situations, I use that atleast as much as Recluse in pve, most likely more. I mean it can kill several mobs at once, it\`s almost OP ;)  
---
I also try to have fun with different kinds of weapons, not always the one that kills fastest, but thats just me.  
---
Mountaintop is just bonkers and I wish it was deleted from the game, both in pve and pvp \^\^
---
Where should I farm for random powerful drops?
---
Good combo using the dragonfly helm
---
Getting from 900-920 is also stupid easy as long as you walk and chew gum at the same time by completing bounties alongside milestones instead of one or the other. Plus valor/glory ranks (not sub ranks) give a powerful drop every time. Quit crying just cuz you don‚Äôt know how to prioritize.
---
Yeah this is the best my guardians have looked in a long time
---
No idea
---
That's the deluxe version with 4 season passes.  Shadowkeep itself is only $35.
---
I want this as an ornament!!
---
I just punch things
---
Well fuck
---
Kill yellowbars, throw orb in forge for two rounds this is repeated and then the spider tank drops. Melt legs to expose reactor, melt boss, repeat as many times as needed
---
Also if anyone says something about my motes or primeval damage, they had their primeval up a few minutes before we even had ours up so I sat on portal killing adds then jumping through to start popping skulls and heal that primeval up
---
Go try to get the chest glitch, it's pretty quick to get and you don't have to fight anyone
---
There's a big difference between things being hard to do and things just taking time to do. Quit meddling into discussions you don't understand.
---
Riskrunner is amazing in Bergusia, as almost all the Fallen there hit you with Arc. Shoot the spider bot‚Äôs legs (focus your fire on one) until the armor breaks &amp; the weak spot opens up, then unload. Celestial Goldengun, Chaos Reach, burn your heavy. Have one fireteam member on the blue adds, to keep the timer going.
---
I get what you mean, riskrunner being better definitely makes sence since it's an exotic and exotics are meant to be the best in the area they perform in (unfortunately alot of exotics arnt like this) mountaintop was out right broken last season but now that they have gotten rid of auto loading on alot of the abilitys in the game I think it's in a good place.
---
worked TY
---
With the mida mini tool you can reacquire it from the collections tab-it's on the same menu thingy as your inventory- It's the same as that for all Jon randomised weapons/armours.
---
I love how chock full of stuff the battle pass is. Just wish I    didn't have to treat Destiny like a job to get what I played for.
---
Nope, normal
---
Same here... was finally happy to get Liars Handshake and got Wavesplitter... I guess I can wait another week :/
---
I‚Äôm looking for someone to raid with I‚Äôm on Xbox anyone down
---
Riskrunner is your friend here. If you do it right, you'll never need to reload.
---
You can‚Äôt use the five of swords in the ordeal
---
Is liars good? I wanted to try and get it, but It always seems like people call it bad.
---
Wasn't trying to do heroic menagerie
---
Haha, I do feel that lost part. It's like a second life, at this point, just to keep up, but I like it.
---
&gt;60 with no mods is also the highest I've seen and it too came from a raid.
---
God I hope not.
---
I'm just trying to get all those invader kills. I'm the worst at PVP and I feel bad for using our team's invade when I come back with 1-2 kills if I'm lucky.
---
The most concise summary of OPs sob-story üëåüèª
---
well it seemed so... im very dissapointed too
---
Prime engrams are world drops, crucible rank ups, the new raid, etc. Just do anything that says "powerful reward" :)
---
Just follow these quests to unlock the stuff. If u are looking for the expansion content, hit up Amanda Holiday in the tower to do the 2 year 1 campaigns. For the black armory, u need to hit up spider in the tangled shore to get started on the quest to unlock the forges.
---
For gambit just launch it from the director
---
For the menagerie, keep power leveling then go talk to Benedict in the tower or in watcher's grave on nessus to kick-start the quest to unlock it
---
