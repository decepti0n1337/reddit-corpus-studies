A little bit intimidated?
---
---
---
I aim to scare my foes.
---
It took us tine to master but we have it now.
---
Because the armor looks better then the one Shaxx has and you can only get one key a week so it‚Äôs better to stack keys now and have them ready.Plus if you‚Äôre like me you‚Äôll have thousands of crucible tokens to spend.
---
Midnightsmith is my favourite IMO but right now I'm using gambit steel so I can match my friend.
---
Can't take a joke apparently.
---
Then it works! If only they were still selling it, I only have it on PC and not PS4, PS4 is my primary Cross Save account now

Who needs Moon‚Äôs Haunted when you have

Can someone sbubby this?

Shit I'm good being the Nelson of the fireteam. 
---
Ha ha.
---
Finally got NF first season back from season 1 but high rank comp wasn‚Äôt fun at all:/
---
Upvote for Chad O'Keef
---
Yeah i feel the same way about recluse
---
Pve gets too easy so I choose different guns
---
I‚Äôd buy you a chad okeefe if I could, sadly, I cannot
---
Tom Hanks
---
Yes you are very wrong. Everything goes to 750 when shadowkeep launches, old guardians and their gear, as well as the drops for kinderguardians.
---
Well as u can hear on nessus ‚Äúdeath follows u‚Äù...
---
Not Chad!!
---
This warlock looks like it got its gear at the trash bins behind a thrift store....why you think Ikora looks so shocked?
---
Ok. Well remember that this ‚Äúfriend‚Äù  was obviously not a friend and remember it‚Äôs like a bad breakup, they obviously didn‚Äôt care about you, so you need to a better more trusting friend who cares about and continue to play the game you love don‚Äôt have a shit ‚Äúfriend ‚Äú ruin it for you.
---
We leave no survivors.
---
Bro three way bday chain? Sept 17 for the win bb
---
I‚Äôd say you remember them, but move forward in earnest looking to build a new guardian up how they did for you.
---
I started my clan back in the beta of Destiny 1. Taught a bunch of guys the raids and now, none of them talk to me/play games.
---
I started D2 about two months ago (ish) and haven‚Äôt found too many great players or connections yet. 
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 and need a good community that‚Äôs growing‚Äî add me and we can team up! My clan still has open slots hahah.
---
Psn- Lucienus
---
Psn? Hit me up! I need more people! Psn: Lucienus
---
She killed a ton of people with a train, the drifter works with the vanguard and shin malphur to kill actual shadows
---
You talking to me?
---
October 1st bro, it got delayed with the launch of shadowkeep
---
I believe the date was pushed back to October 1st.
---
I got a clan, it was me who built them up more than anything, but yeah itd be nice to still have another friend, Im on PS4 Ill add you soon
---
You can still play if your not happy but coming to a games sub reddit asking how to get over someone you played with in the past isn't really about the game itself. Your post just seems a bit off topic, have you tried /r/relationships you may find better guidance over there when it comes to getting over someone.
---
Also my birthday! Happy birthday to both of you guys!!
---
AHHHHHHHHHHH WTF! This had me for long enough to consider leaving work suddenly(*cough cough) to go home and play.
---
The drifter, afaik, is just a pawn. He doesn't know about the bigger picture. Not really, at least.
---
  
---
She didn't kill anyone with the train, you dingus.
---
I googled **Chad O Keefe** to get meme materials but ended up in obituary.
---
I got depressed.  :(
---
Well, people have this problem in other games too and they do share it as a memory, not as a complaint. I saw someone above who is willing to play with you but look like you don‚Äôt like? If you have problem, you post it here and people offer help but you refuse then I don‚Äôt know the reason why you post it here.
---
That is not what I said. I never once said: please come and replace my old friend. I meant I need to get over the old friend.
---
Good luck on the recluse if you don‚Äôt have it already! I bet u can do it
---
To their credit, CoO and Warmind we‚Äôre both trash. But hopefully shadowkeep lands on the Taken King/ Forsaken said of the releases
---
2 weeks huh? Lol come on dude, be real. You either bought them, or it took longer than 2 weeks. That‚Äôs 4 pinnacles, and unless you play 20 hours a day, you didn‚Äôt grind out 4 pinnacles in 2 weeks.
---
Here's a link to the article:

True, but they dont give it another chance.
---
Singed by me
---
Ahhh sorry I meant to comment first but my phone lagged out. Was gonna say ‚Äúnot pictured was recluse‚Äù. Haha. And yeah thanks to the community. I had a helluva time trying to get the glory till I met some streamers and started playing with people in his twitch lobby. I feel like my eyes are gonna bleed but man. So worth it.
---
Appreciated. Lol
---
It‚Äôs PVE mainly, although I‚Äôve been running some iron banner lately. I have a resilience mod on a chest piece that I have planned on swapping to a recovery I just haven‚Äôt gotten one in a bit. I have noticed the colony not being too well in PVE also that‚Äôs why I wanted another opinion. GLs with aggressive frames seem to be hot lately in PVE. I have Outrageous Fortune with range finder and rampage but I‚Äôd rather have it with spike grenades. Last Man Standing works well in PVP for the most part but id rather run Telesto. I just don‚Äôt have a decent heavy to run that isn‚Äôt exotic atm. I have two tailed fox and the colony
---
My quality is usually horrible
---
I almost didn‚Äôt lol it took season of opulence to bring me back to d2, since then I found a clan I sort of like and grinding for exotics has been fun but I would understand why someone wouldn‚Äôt want to come back, the game still needs a lot of work that hopefully shadowkeep will address. Making New Light was a great first step to being players back in!
---
One of the best sceneries in the game. üëç
---
Yeah two weeks since I started paying attention to it. Had most of redrix done just casually playing. Didn‚Äôt pay. Just kept playing wayyyyyyy more hours than I should have lol. Had 140 glory just over two weeks ago. Solo queues up till the last 600 pts then found a guy to pair up with for the last bit. Worked on multiple quests at the same time.
---
Whatever takes it.
---
I seen't it. It was the best of times, it was the best of times.
---
I've been reading this comment since you posted it, and still can't figure out which character you are..
---
Everything is delayed until October 1st
---
Bungie make Chad o'keefe a npc please
---
How did you make your guardian smile???
---
I could do a more detailed version of what I think would look lit if you'd like
---
Max is 750, people have been there for a while. 30 light in IB has always been significant
---
Thanks! I thought there might be a delay or maybe something for season pass holders. Appreciate the help!
---
That's be awesome!!! I support any decision
---
*gets pre-nerf LOW*
---
And now he haunts the moon üåï
---
according to gamesradar and polygon, shadowkeep also doesn't cross platforms. each license is separate.
---
How do you know you're doing half damage?
---
Destiny 2 becomes free to play on October 1. You can get it on steam at that time. Yes, you will need to go through steam, as it is moving off of battle net and on to steam. [More information in the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/by457o/faq_shadowkeep_cross_save_free_to_play_and_more/) linked in one of the sticky posts on this subreddit.
---
This is not a "hardcore MMO," or even strictly speaking a real MMO, as the maximum number of players you will see at any time is relatively small. You do not *need* to refer to outside resources in order to succeed. There aren't really builds, there's just item synergy (example: you have an armor mod that boosts reload speed for a certain gun type, so you use guns of that type). I highly recommend actually paying attention to the game when you start out, as a lot of the time things are communicated in the story dialogue or simply by being placed on the map with the expectation that you will see/hear. For some reason many people do not understand what quest markers look like in this game, so if you are ever lost, you can view major objectives on the left side of the director (solar system map). I recommend taking some time to look at the character menu and director, as there is never any sort of tutorial telling you to do this. 
---
In the open world areas, there are public events that occur periodically that any players in the area can participate in. If you complete a secret objective, it will turn these into "heroic" versions that are slightly different and give a lot more xp. You can attempt to figure out how to do these through trial and error or by watching other players, or if you would like, from looking at [guides.](https://www.niris.tv/blog/hpe). 
---
[My guide to getting in to raiding,](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/c95ss6/a_guide_to_raiding_in_season_7_for_new_players/) though this will not be relevant until you have *at least* finished the vanilla campaign, as you cannot enter raids before then.
---
i,,,,,should really start working on some catalysts
---
Keep in mind that super energy generates slower. I can‚Äôt do math so I genuinely have no idea how much that will affect this, but it‚Äôs also something to remember. Super energy economy may be a bigger thing now
---
I get that on a personal level
---
That is me trying to get the double kills for mt. Top and my teammates keep getting the final blows on the second guy
---
pro lore tip: Literally everything the Drifter says that can be fact checked has been found to be a lie.
---
Including everything he said about Aunor.
---
Correct, but if they don‚Äôt mess with geomags and super energy is so slow, then this will be all the more useful!
---
Mine too. My luck it'll only be available by playing PvP or the raid which means I'll never get it. ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§
---
Oooof. RIP in the chat.
---
*xxNOOBSLAYERxx has dropped 15 motes*
---
Recluse is sorta getting a nerf, thanks to the ricochet rounds range nerf, sadly I do enjoy using the gun but only because it is the only SMG with the ability to synergize with any other weapon
---
I know that flinching exist, after rewatching it the poor warlock wasn't afk you can see OP take a tiny bit of  damage. If the opponent was a good sniper in a non power enabled scenario he could have possibly killed op, you just can't come down and say one thing will 100% of the time one sided. If redrix was that consistent all the time then a butt ton of people would be using it along with bygones and HCs. And I agree flinching while scoped in is horrendous and I'm sure a nerf would maybe lead to others to try sniping again and put down and shotty and vooper for a awhile
---
Taken King set the bar , D2 reaches that bar again with forsaken after falling even below D1 quality levels before that.
---
Curtis sirus was shit tho
---
This is actually my first catalyst and I've been working on getting the cosmology kills I haven't really gone for the grind what was your favorite locale?
---
"And I would not be surprised if the renegade who hunts the Shadows, the Hunter who forged the Golden Gun itself, was close behind."
---
~Message from Aunor III
---
doesn't matter how skilled you are, flinch while ADS'd into a sniper literally makes everything impossible to hit, even with unflinching sniper aim armor perks, either they need to make it so unflinching sniper aim is an actually useful armor perk or flat out nerf flinching on everything else so sniping can actually be good again.
---
last word and beloved are really good. thorn and mindbender‚Äôs also. if you want to get some hate mail use erentil. austringer with eye of the storm/rangefinder is nice at mid-somewhat long range. bygones or blast furnace of you prefer pulse rifle.
---
Lmao you just made my point perfectly. You don't need any special abilities because the dogs are hella easy to kill with any decent dps weapons.
---
Absolutely get recluse if he still sells the quest for it. Great to use in almost any situation in the game at all (PvE included for those rare raiding days) with the only exception being a few game modes on the more long range crucible maps.
---
As a pc player I love the hand cannons. 
---
Gonna need at least 5 more in shadowkeep. 
---
Can‚Äôt disagree with this post enough, get rekt OP.
---
That's wasn't the deal.
---
Correct. Although Mountaintop's DPS ability is being removed essentially with things like Well/Lunafaction no longer auto-refilling it.
---
As a DPS maching towards Majors and crowds Mountaintop will still be great. As will Reculse on adds and in PvP.
---
Can you imagine a hydra shell?
---
*cries in chasm of screams that I can't beat*
---
I own it and I've played with it and it has left me in situations that any other loadout I use has not. tbh I enjoy popping heads with my snipers either across the map or literally next to you.
---
Also been adapting to the meta and being a shotgun ape even tho I highly dislike it while using a bunch of other cheesy weapons like j√∂tunn and telesto and so on.
---
It's to get you to the new power cap of 750. Blues aren't capped at 500
---
you get items depending on 1. activity and 2. your power level
---
if you play a low level adventure you get items based on that level. if you play random activities, you get random blue drops that have ~20 power less than your current max. 690 blues are from a quest given to all who play SoO,in order to reach the minimum power required to play this season
---
All Legendary Sparrows have a chance to drop at 160. You can re-aquire them from collections also with a chance tobdrop at 160. I do that with all my sparrows. Ill just jeep re-aquiring them until i get the "takes less time tonsummon" perk on it
---
Latest Viidoc, which looks spicy. We get to see Eris yelling at ghosts, with our confused guardian and an extremely concerned Ikora.
---
You'll be seeing a lot more *YOU'RE ALL INSUFFERABLE* memes in the future.
---
Thank you so much for the detailed response! Good info
---
Indigo matrix
---
bl3 is out already...
---
As far as I've seen they're capped at 740
---
Sure ain‚Äôt on steam
---
Oh I remember the grind. But I was a FWC boy so got Sunshot instead.
---
Really? Weird. Maybe they‚Äôre drops from anywhere then. Like Crimson and Tractor Cannon.
---
Ricochet rounds getting nerfed effects its range a bit and its magnetism will lower slightly. Not a direct nerf, but it's still a good one.
---
I‚Äôm still missing Sweet Business and Risk Runner. Not too bothered about SB but RR is the one I‚Äôm craving.
---
I heard Chad is killing innocent puppies! For the Puppies!!
---
Oh ok. I thought everything got boosted to 750 anyway on the 1st
---
Chad O‚ÄôKeefe is hunted.
---
If you think that you haven‚Äôt seen the raid gear
---
This is in a room below the green room in the Whisper mission that spawns endless thrall - super easy to chain the cosmology kills. I had both parts of the catalyst done in under an hour. 
---
Otherwise starting level 1 of EP is pretty good if you get an instance on your own.
---
Maybe it's Mountaintop.
---
Aunor is a control freak that wanted the vanguards ghost under her control
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
[I AM HE. HE IS ME. ](https://imgur.com/a/UTGl4jI)
---
Yea, Destiny registers bringing out your ghost like taking out a new weapon and perks, like the one OP mentioned, go away once you go off the weapon it was proc'd for.
---
YoUr AnGeR Is ToXiC SeEk HeLp... so many fragile people on reddit lol shit happens and that looks like an OG xbox.
---
It's not a direct disadvantages, because you only get to choose 1 skill-tree: AFAIK all classes have multiple viable choices right now. If future balance makes it so that the Forsaken skill-tree is far better than the others for some class then it is indeed bad (doubt it will happen, or stay for long if it does).
---
So yeah currently you need Forsaken for it, but some people speculate that Bungee will open the 3rd tree for everyone after release (never has been officially confirmed or denied).
---
If you go to the lost sector directly above this area, there's a small bridge where you can shoot people from. The best reactions are always from the top of Devrim's church though, and I have made a few friends from that.
---
Jesus I had no idea
---
Thank you
---
What‚Äôs De-
---
Great oryx was a grampa
---
Definitely a warlock
---
Unfortunately she had to send the whole shipment back to Fenchurch. That's why we don't have a void shell this week Guardians.
---
Cam someone explain me the origin of this meme?
---
Medallion is 25% bonus on all activities + increases loot for your entire fireteam
---
Ghost is 10%xp only for you
---
Nooooooo üòî Thank you
---
I would honestly recommend getting Forsaken over Shadowkeep if picking between the two.
---
Shadowkeep has the most recent stuff, but probably won‚Äôt offer much when it comes to PvP. Forsaken comes with tonnes of new content, story, abilities and gear.
---
And now the annual pass will come with Forsaken, which has 3 seasons worth of content, and some of the best weapons in the game.
---
Its not the damage that makes it an Exotic. Its the buff... that disappears when the wind changes. Lord of Wolves and Recluse maintain their buffs despite swapping, so why the hell does the Tarrabrah not?!
---
Just enjoy the game. And be ready to enjoy it infinitely more once it‚Äôs October.
---
In a YouTube video the automatic caption said chad o'keefe and there was a meme about it. Now it's a mix of "Jesus Christ it's Jason born, and Destiny 2"
---
I use it frequently lol, really enjoying the gun.
---
Ahh, brother!
---
How many breads have you eaten?
---
Division is about being the most dangerous garbage man in the dc area.  At least in destiny if you dont need gear you can take it apart and use it to make your gear better. In division you can take it apart for mats needed for gear you will never build because its shit gear. Or you can sell it for credits with nothing to spend them on. Ive already won. Theres nothing to get or achieve. Just get some ok gear and your there. Do the story and bam.
---
When the gangs hanging out on the moon but you're stuck in the ascendant realm
---
Teabagging, not cool
---
Would be great without the bag
---
All Forsaken Owners now have annual pass btw
---
Console players over here like.. "we only get 1 sens and it's only 1 through 10" 
---
Seriously though console controller options are ancient and outdated by about 20 years literally
---
No he's badass

Ikora's probably like "wtf is going on"
---
*Chad O'Keefe
---
Is this from a new trailer?
---
You have forsaken this raid
---
yeah lol
---
You could not live with your own failure, and where did that bring you? Back to me.
---
No, there are several guardians .
---
He'll, zavala is a guardian...
---
no proof
---
It has been confirmed. We will have to reinstall. [See this interview](https://youtu.be/fqBTr7tk6vU?t=1100) where they VERY briefly mention having to redownload the game on steam, and apparently never said this important piece of info anywhere else ever again.
---
I guess I‚Äôm ridiculous then, as I always have one active whenever I play. I also have 60+ thousand bright dust and accumulate more dust than I spend, even while always popping medallions.
---
Also, were we able to buy seasons individualy, so I can get thorn?
---
So glad that Thursday is a holiday in Germany and I took the Friday off.
---
"Oh they're a monster. Nice"
---
it was never this way early d2, and definitely don‚Äôt remember it being a thing in d1 but i was always on top of raids in that game, just coming back to this game since Forsaken dropped and i never had an issue in iron banner before that.
---
I'm with you on that. Now that I have it, try and stop me. Lol
---
Arc Souls should've been mini shriekers.
---
Power in IB is enabled since Forsaken launched, basically 1 year and 1 day ago.
---
I mean. It‚Äôs all in self defense
---
well see that makes sense. i stopped playing when forsaken was released, and this is the first day of iron banner i‚Äôve played since then. thanks for giving actual info unlike these other mouth breathers
---
Too risky to convince the rest of the city the vanguard may be the army but they can't wage war by themselves. They would need to get the consent of the other major factions.
---
Wellock reporting in, got all the loadout let's raid that bitch.
---
so i had a little time and read all that. if i may ask you this: do you think i will not have access to meta defining weapons? as far as i understand i can do all the little instances and the raid seems to be "worthless" because the lightlevel we be too low. so all thats left should be the forsaken+pass quest exotics right? how powerfull are they. i hear a lot about izanagi thorn recluse etc.
---
this whole system seems kinda wierd. one would think with the immense effort of breaking free from actiblizzard they would make it clear cut for returning players and new ones to jump in.
---
Damn, I'm dealing that little damage at 739 light?
---
Makes sense though. Didn't think about it. Thanks.
---
Oh woow haha thanks!
---
Catalysts, masterworking, chalice, forge, pinnacles, mods, armor 2.0 is coming, the list goes on and has been building for a while
---
How's warframe's endgame btw? Is there any real end goal to the effort anyone puts in that grind simulator yet?
---
And it‚Äôs Veronica instead of Omnigul
---
Np
---
Downvoted. Not surprised. DGWC is the name of my PC clan. We named it ironically, because we love Destiny, but would always hear that phrase from people who didn't like it. Dead Game, Who Cares.
---
It's called the flood, it's ridiculous, I got mine from gambling at moxies so I don't know where else you could get it
---
All fun and games until and enemy jumps in front of you while using it and blow yourself up lol
---
Bows are a hit scan weapon when they are fully drawn bro...  So there's no help to be had for velocity
---
Yeah, good point.. if the numbers of Guardians was canon meaning all the players then wouldn't that mean there's enough Guardians to both attack and defend if necessary?
---
Hell, judging from the fact the Eliksni lost their homeworld, I'd ally with them and allow them to build their own community on Earth and help rebuild and usher both Humanity and Eliksni into a new Golden Age
---
Don't rainbow read me.
---
Post this on r/memes and see how many ‚Äúdead game‚Äù comments it gets
---
oh wonderful, looks like i‚Äôm not gonna be playing iron banner this week lol, no way i‚Äôm getting to 730 from level 36 in one week and still have enough time to complete iron banner bounties
---
I haven‚Äôt played warlock in a while, what exactly happens in that one?
---
They are revamping competitive to be completely fair. Solo queue and multi queue, 3v3, grind for legend and fabled will be significantly easier.
---
So, why does the person have gloves on for whatever they're handling in the top pic?
---
Let's hell them out and created a new faction. The Uplifted. No longer Fallen, but Eliksni who seek to push forward rather than live in the past.
---
Prepare to be downvoted, a lot.
---
*The Great Disaster would like to know your location*
---
\^\^ same, I just died when I read that
---
im so proud of this community
---
Yes, exactly!
---
never thought of it that way, but wasn‚Äôt it after the whirlwind and the traveler abandoned them that they just absolutely despise the traveler? meaning they wouldn‚Äôt join forces because they wouldn‚Äôt be sure the traveler (even in its current state) wouldn‚Äôt leave again?
---
Its not as if its even the damaging perk, its literally just the charge up buff! If you could charge it while you had another weapon out, that would actually make it useful too.
---
 Instead, you have to run around with an SMG out, getting hit/damaging things until its charged, then you can slowly reload it to activate the VERY short buff of 2-3x damage (I say short, because unless its a Boss, you will get intermissions of nothing to hit, combined with a reload, you can easily lose it completely). Except its also SMG damage, so even doubled, its not that awe inspiring. Theres just so many more useful guns about, especially if you're already doing CoS...
---
Asked the phil here, not him.
---
If on playstation hold down the touchpad they changed where it is
---
I‚Äôm the only Phil that plays in my office(Ohio, USA).. And the only one that plays period in my office. I guess everyone else wants to continue missing out.
---
I'm on the Tangled Shore
---
I see, I'll try that then, thanks

There's was a contingency of Guardians stationed on the moon, per Zavalas orders, but they all started leaving so they could go play gambit after the Drifter showed up. It's in the lore somewhere but I can't remember where.
---
song of ir yut, the machine gun (legendary slot) pierced the hive Knight wall of darkness, any grenade made them jump out of the shield as well
---
*ANGRY ZAVALA*
---
Stop that
---
Only 7 hours old.  We've been had.
---
I got one that's triple tap demolitionist but it's stability spec'd and one with air assault rangefinder fullbore accurized. Both are fun to use and feel good
---
Can I have the template please?
---
Unfortunately I'm on pc
---
Thanks for the info. Honestly thats pretty cool but you tell me, this is Bungie, the guys that made Halo and the amazing competitive mode that it had. Yet here we are in year 3 of D2 and they're fixing the most basic things in the game. These changes should have been in since day 1. 
---
I spent too much money and time on Destiny 1 &amp; 2 but I'm done getting scammed.
---
I don‚Äôt mind how the gun functions, I can‚Äôt stand how much damage it does. I have an issue with a tracking explosive that isn‚Äôt a heavy being able to one shot through an overshield/almost one shotting supers to the body.
---
That wizard came from the Moon
---
i need a taken shader for my warlock bad
---
Tracking firebolts (think boltcaster) that extend super
---
I don't tbh what did I miss
---
Yeah I'm going to grind forge and menagerie
---
Get off my subreddit you F I L T H Y  C A S U A L
---
Shame that this shell is most likely going to join my Sagira shell in sitting in my vault while I continue to use my +10%xp shell....
---
Really wish we'd get a system that allows us to use any ghost perk on any ghost shell :(
---
(sigh) .....yes. I can confirm how true this is. TLW quest was rough
---
I barely have a positive KD in PvP and I did it. Chill, you got this.
---
Is this out right now or does it drop later? If so it's time to play forges with my friend who doesnt want to spend 30 bucks on a game he only kinda plays (understable)
---
Yeah, let‚Äôs kill Zavala
---
Aw man, well they‚Äôll be good for the healing on then!
---
Congrats my man! Judging from the clip, sounds like you had someone egging you on the whole time!
---
Why is there still no news on this?
---
Ah true, I whipped out my old masterworked Nature of the Beast and used that
---
Doing ace of spades with my friend who plays pve exclusively was b a d. It took him 30 games to get 25 HC headshot kills.
---
(points at other comments) yes exactly. OEM is pretty overpowered and the fact it's a STAPLE in comp is a testimony to that. Skull fort can be annoying but it's not op because it's just not viable in comp at all.
---
I dont see you killing a single dog
---
Or look away.
---
Please match the singe and multipliers when doing menagerie :p
---
Dude was actually John wick in his original life
---
If fireteam medallions still work as they do now, I'd suggest using those. They give a +25% XP buff and do not stack with the XP ghost perk. They are pretty cheap and it's hella worth using them for the season pass.
---
That‚Äôs rough, has he played since?
---
Apes
---
Together
---
#Strong
---
A perk might sound good tho, but then turn out to not be worth it, is what I was saying. Back in D1 I wasn't the type to browse the net for videos or forums for all that "god roll" info so I wasted a lot of time with shit guns and I don't think there's a point to that anymore. We'll have a grind with armor now in shadowkeep but be able to pick our perks. A good compromise in my eyes
---
I use it for infinite ground slams in pve, doesn't work great in PvP though.
---
I always called it a raid cause 6 people would go in it and it had new mechanics
---
Rude.
---
Accurate, yeah, but rude.

Hardest thing for me was getting used to hand cannons. I didn't play a lot of crucible to start with but it took me ages to get used to the feel of hand cannons, I was usually a rifle guy. A good Trust helped me a lot though (yes console). I got Luna's Howl last season then gave up on the kills with that as required for Not Forgotten. I just got frustrated that I couldn't hit my shots the way I did with Trust and later Service Revolver.

Those people have every right to be pissed, but that doesn't meant they should review bomb  the game when that no longer reflects the current state of the game. Some one who hasn't played the game in over a year isn't going to leave helpful information about new content for someone who is looking to get into the game in it's current state.

Things that dismantle into bright dust will dismantle into legendary shards after shadow keep if I read that right

Logic says they will all be bumped to 50.

Walls kill blade barrage, improper clipping kills blade barrage, blade barrage kills blade barrage.

He isn't using shoulder charge. It's bottom tree Hammers melee. Fire proc gives it away.
---
Character level goes away completely starting next season.  Everyone will start at 750 power.  There will be a battle pass level (1-100) and an artifact level that doesn't cap but resets each season. Gear power level looks to be going up to 960.

I played ESO, and even then most people hate the PvP because how unbalanced and frustrating it is. MMOs shine in their PvE endgame...which is what D2 shines in.
---
I was more comparing to CS:GO, Halo (excluding vehicles), CoD, Apex, the shooter aspect. Ya know, games that require you to shoot well and work as a team, without clear advantages because you have an exotic that others might not have.

I don‚Äôt have a source, but I remember reading somewhere that there *is* a detachment of Guardians that maintained the Hellmouth patrol zone after Oryx‚Äôs defeat. 
---
However, they had to retreat during the Red War due to losing their light.
---
From what I understand, they returned to the moon to secure the patrol zone and keep an eye on the weakened Hive that still remain there.
---
If I also recall correctly, the Guardians deployed to secure the Moon aren‚Äôt regular Guardians. I remember reading somewhere they they‚Äôre apparently special forces of some kind.
---
I don‚Äôt know how the Vanguard has a special forces division, since from my understanding *all* Guardians are technically considered special units by the Consensus, since they‚Äôre straight up super-soldiers compared to the standard FOTC.
---
It sounds like you just hate the idea of ANY kind of meta. Sorry, but that's how MMO PvP works. If you don't like it, stay out of PvP.
---
It must be my lowered brightness on my TV, because this looks normal to me.

Not even just see the reviews. I played destiny 1 base game, thought it was insanely bad and never played again. I gave them another chance because I had heard that destiny 1 had fixed itself and became a good game. Destiny 2 base game was pretty bad/boring. Came back a month ago and idk how I got my way through curse of Osiris and Watkins because that shit was terrible too. They deserve all the hate in the world even though I like playing the game because they‚Äôve charged countless people 60 dollars for 2 games that were empty and then even a lot of the dlc was hit or miss

What now?

Thank you, will check once home in a bit

There's a joke here, I just can't put my fist on it though...
---
I can't WAIT to thundercrash into his strawberry jello lookin ass   
---
he'd be expecting the D1 fist of havoc then he just sees something entering orbit at ridiculous speed then he'd be like "^(oh no wheres me dad")
---
I don't think it's unlocks until Oct 1st
---
The Twitter post said its free from 17/09
---
Thanks for letting me know.  If you ever get it to work or if I ever get it to work I'll reply to this comment.

I guess we will have to wait.
---
I'm not sure we should expect Rasputin to act as a metal detector pointed at the whole galaxy.
---
Hell, it'd be interesting just to know what's his definition of "protecting humanity" is. Is it cooperation? Early warning system? Might as well just go with the "not lifting a finger unless humanity is unable to sustain itself after X coming event". Which then means he's just simply keeping us from extinction. And "not being extinguished" and "not suffering" are worlds apart.
---
Given he basically moddle-fingered the Guardians (or just Zavala, depending how you look at it), Rasputin might as well act "against" us since he refuses to go along with us.
---
For all we know, Rasputin has already made a model of the coming events and is like "Nah, they can shoot their way out of this one no problem", and went back to thawing some more Hive with extreme prejudice
---
This looks normal to me
---
*desolate robes has joined the chat*

If you purchase a pc game key from some where you should be able to redeem it on Blizzard now.  Blizzard said it should work, but if not you will be able to use it Oct 1 on Steam without an issue.  So if you want to try, go for it.

Why the fuck would people downvote that
---
idk
---
cdkeys codes still working, just did it now :)
---
;)
---
Same, haven‚Äôt touched oem this whole time. Top tree shoulder charge all day, hun.
---
You invade with a scout and hand cannon?
---
Invading with middle tree arcstrider is a gamble. You hoping they have truth/golden gun otherwise you waste an invasion.
---
The Hive are literally the most destructive race in the Destiny universe and you say there is ‚Äúbigger fish to fry‚Äù than monitoring their fucking home base????
---
Doesnt mean he cant come back. He was busy filming The Rookie, I think.
---
Glad I'm not a warlock main
---
Wonderfully disturbing! Thank you!
---
Imagine thousands of guardians die because the ones who were supposed to monitor the moon left to play Gambit lmao
---
Only true OGs remember
---
If you can‚Äôt manage to get 100 headshots with hand cannons then you‚Äôre not really going to get much out of getting Luna. I get collecting to collect, but yeah.
---
Ikelos hc*

High rpm and high impact pulse rifles have just got a buff where they can consistently 3 tap in crucible. 
---
Give the Horrors Least, Claws of the Wolf, Outlast a go for high rpm pulses and
---
Redrix‚Äôs Broadsword for a high impact a go
---
What about xbox
---
Check your pursuits tab?
---
Cool, every day you learn something new
---
Haha, so true. 
---
It also took them a while to notice our satellites were off line right before the attack on the tower.  
---
I was going to jump on the first Dead Orbit ship off this crazy planet, but for some strange reason Arach is no longer talking to me.
---
No lie I once invaded with 11 motes don't why but I got like 2 kills and made it back safe (as it was I think the other team was getting stomped by mine) so it didn't really make much a difference whether I loss them or not.
---
Did the same Wed Thur Fri. I will go in on Tuesday as content won‚Äôt work till 1pm assuming servers survive
---
You think that's bad try having the Invasion portal sit open repeatedly and no one but you invades.
---
What‚Äôs this vid called? I wanna watch it, can‚Äôt wait for moons haunted day, pre-ordering digital deluxe for two-tailed fox and ornament.
---
i was doing Crown a few weeks ago and everyone had absolute shit damage... but i was sitting over there with 5 mil i think
---
Yeah a longer campaign would be great CoO was only like 2 hours long from start to finish. And some more strikes would be nice I mean without the strike being tied to a dlc but just added in for more variety.
---

I remember this one.

Finally a post I can relate to entirely. Every, single, clip.
---
‚ÄúI really needed that Spare Rations‚Äù
---
Yes. 
---
Maybe. 
---
It's RNG... and subjective.
---
Fuck the recluse grind tho, honestly makes me wanna break the keyboards of all those OEM titan apes in comp every single time I am pitted against 4 of them.
---
Something like the Vidoc 3, it‚Äôs on the bungie or destiny YouTube channel. They talk about what‚Äôs to come in shadowkeep and after.
---
K, thanks
---
You don't need to buy it now since on october first the base game is going to become free to play. That'll give you a chance to try it out, play that story, play the first raid and then decide if you want to buy the additional content
---
Nice. I have highest seniority and am 1 of 3 bosses. I let everyone know exactly the good time I‚Äôm gonna have.
---
Canonically the rest of the guardians go to the dreaming city. It's not just us. There are many more entries. There's one in particular on one of the dreaming city weapons, it goes something like one of the awoken goes to the city to ask for help. There are guardians playing with the purple ball, some gearing up, stuff like that. Idk. And they give a small speech about asking for help with the dreaming city, that there will be tons of loot and that the Awoken's secrets will be revealed.
---
Damn I don't even get this many views on YouTube wtf
