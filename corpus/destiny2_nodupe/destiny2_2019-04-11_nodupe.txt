Ayyy I just saw this one on insta.
---
His insta page is @brianmoncus
---
Very cool!
---

---
What is meant by 'curated roll?'
---
Edgier than the sword logic
---
* Sights - Personal preference honestly  
---
* Magazine   
---
**Accurized Rounds** (+10 Range)  
---
**Steady Rounds** (-5 Range, +10 Stability)  
---
**Extended Mag** \- You lose reload speed, but your magazine goes from 40 to 52.  Extended mag synergizes amazingly with trait perks such as Ambitious Assassin and Rampage.  
---
**Drop Mag** is also decent if your ammo management skills are good.  
---
* Trait 1 Slot  
---
**Outlaw**  
---
**Feeding Frenzy (BEST PERK IN THIS SLOT)**  
---
**Zen Moment** is pretty solid too  
---
* Trait 2 Slot  
---
**Kill Clip**  
---
**Rampage**
---
Yeah but they move like 1 foot per sec. you could walk faster than those mfs
---
The worst part is I could see myself owning one irl and asking my wife that very question.
---
Slova Bomb and skull, no mods except heavyweight and void singe, kill yourself with a rocket launcher right before the chest spews its loot.
---
Why are people complaining about this? I don't think this sort of trend will continue as if they're going to only keep adding hand-cannons.
---
The only reason they've added them is because these weapons were highly begged for by the community.
---
Thorn, Last word, Hawkmoon, rose etc.
---
That little reload haha
---
thanks, gonna try this one rn!
---
Cerberus+1 is a shotgun pretending to be an auto rifle. If you have it? Use it.
---
Titans aren't as effective in literally one piece of content that requires 0 attention, and apparently that means they're the worst class
---
Someone's salty about getting shoulder charged
---
Yes it was lmao
---
That sounds good too. I sure hope they fix this soon
---
I mean yeah, that's three "shots". Release the Wolves would be better if the longer you held it it could go up to 10
---
Very healthy, absolutely a good time.
---
This is why I run whirlwind guard
---

---
They patched the chest farm
---
YES, HE'S BACK! I'm so glad you're posting man, this stuff is amazing.
---
What are you trying to run the game on?
---
People have been asking for transmog since the first month of D1.
---
This boutta become a meme tbh, it'll be the type where it'll say "what my food sees" and "my food" kinda things
---
*it's actually a decent exotic*
---
Welp, ain't that an exploit lol
---
Thank you
---
Well, I suggest trying a round or two of it. It's pretty fun! Once you play it, you'll understand that holding onto your super for a great multi kill isn't as fun/useful as a bunch of single kills. 
---
I'll complain about tether spam cause it kinda defeats the purpose of mayhem, but overall it's a super fun game mode!
---
Try /r/fireteams
---
Grats!
---
I VERY MUCH LIKE WOW
---
I just avoid PVP as a whole now. With the exception of Milestones.
---
If you don’t kill him before he teleports but manage to take his head off, that happens.
---
Have you used prospector?
---
Glad I could help some. What platform are you on?
---
100% might have to commission you to do my next tattoo.
---
Thank you for putting the right thread on here for me. And I will try with both.
---
I did not see that number down there holy shit.
---
Gut gemacht. I just got my first Erentil yesterday with rangefinder and snapshot. Excited to use it soon.
---
This makes me miss D1 so much
---
Oryx was the talkiest pushover ever. Guy wouldn't shut up. At least he took a page from Crota's and was reticent during the raid, lol.
---
I LOL'd through my mic when your Freelancer tells the Monitor to shut up in Anthem. He talked too much too; always having a quip or taunt ready to go whenever.
---
Oh, great artwork btw.
---
Direct-capture screenshots only please.
---
Destiny 1 remaster anyone ???  
---
BRING IT TO PC SO ITS NOT 30 FPS !
---
Level 20
---
yup
---
Yes. I have also used the Thunderlord and Wardcliff and in literally no circumstance would I use it over the others, or even Delirium.
---
Mountaintop is my counter. It’s super good. I can cross map a sniper, two shot a super, or kill a ape at any distance.
---
They make it so you have to unlock the things in game, I think.
---
If the replica was fully to scale, I'd buy one. I already gave a 3d printed one, but an official bungie one would be way cooler. Shame it's only 1/4 scale.
---
&gt;disapprove what I said
---
I can't tell if you're dumb or tired.
---
Guys...the destiny 1 circle jerk is getting really old here. I am sorry you missed D1 in its prime, it was fun but believe me when I say that D2 has so much more to offer and grow.
---
TIL stealing is paying for and getting exactly what you wanted....
---
Idea 1) So a Titan, a Warlock, and a Hunter walk up to Uldren...
---
Idea 2) *TLW, Thorn, Ace* WITH OUR POWERS COMBINED... (making them a perfect set for killing a guardian)
---
I spit my drink out. Memories. Thank you =&gt;
---
Bad Juju has the least hive Magic in it, but it's *STILL* hive magic, thanks for reminding me of that one.
---
Did you have a fireteam medallion going?
---
*dismantle the toaster*
---
Me (non pvp player) trying to get lunas
---
hfjfjf the camera shake is a mood, whenever i have to deal with screebs i cringe i hate bugs
---
What  I don't get is why bungie is so adamant on cores having shitty drop rates and only available through Spider (and that exchange thing with Brother Vance). **Imo they Should just give every major vendor a weekly bounty that nets you 10 Cores.** 
---
10 cores for Crucible / Gambit / Vanguard / Dreaming City / Black Armory / Spider that would still be only 60 cores/week and then you'd have the regular ones from spider which still isn't alot considering how costy infusions and Masterworking are but atleast you wouldn't feel miserable  trying to infuse your Best weapon instead of using the shitty random rolls you get to increase your light level.
---
**Also it's a joke that when you dismantle you rarely get a bounty that gives you 1 single core**, pump those numbers so people can have some fun instead of farming materials to trade Vance...
---
And then we're not talking about masterworking armor and new items for which are good or just for fun.
---
I'd pay a whole other games worth of money for us to have bountiful armors with character and individuality like what oryx wears.
---
I want to steal his *look*
---
Wei ning thought she could punch the darkness, look where that led her, without warlocks like osiris and toland we would have been consumed by the hive or removed from history by the vex.
---
so the key thing in your statement is that the drifter tried to make something *like* thorn
---
see he's a smart man, he chose *not* to use hive magic as all hive magic is corruptive.
---
Knight's bones grafted onto a Cannon named Rose -&gt; corrupted the weapon and its user, whom I have to regretfully mention was a most noble Titan mamed Rezyl Azzir, into Thorn and Dredgen Yor.
---
so the Drifter instead used Taken magic as the catalyst for the weapon, since the Taken have no King, there is no commanding voice that would corrupt us.
---
#at least
---
that's *my* theory anyways.
---
the other option is he found a way to nullify the voices woven into hive magic.
---
You can more or less do this with gambler's dodge, combination blow and liar's handshake
---
How many tries did it take you? I started farming seriously at 17 and now I'm at 50. Only found 3 HCs with crappy rolls
---
Got this on my 132nd run total, i think it was 22nd that day
---
Thx my dude :D
---
I don’t have forsaken yet but I’m getting it when I beat the game
---
I only use him for raid guides. His voice is marginally better than Kackis
---
Pc
---
Imagine being useless in all PvE endgame activities
---
This post was made by Hunter and Warlock association
---
Pretty sure you can only get 1 invader synth from invading in a single match
---
It's really sad that I still have to read posts like this that seem to think that porting over content from D1 to D2 is just copy/paste and fail to understand that not resetting everything at the start of a new game just invites unnecessary problems. 
---
I don't even know where the no reset stuff is coming from. Look at every other Loot based game and now tell me even a single one that allowed you to carry over gear to the next installment.
---
Hey, they have melting point, atleast give them that
---
Imagine being happy that you're useless in all PvE endgame activities
---
This post was made by the Mad Titans association
---
Ah right. I was gonna offer help but I'm on xbox 😅
---
It wont let you buy anythong of the basket is over 2k, bungie just likes the number 7 so they set the price that high
---
I call mine:
---
Huntard
---
Crytan
---
Whorelock
---
Thanks dude!
---
Personally I like it for pvp I thinks it’s an upgrade from claws of the wolf pulse rifle.
---
Ye there called Chad titan. 
---
Hunter.
---
And gay
---
Harry the hunter , Terry the Titan and Wally the warlock ever since d1 day 1
---
you saying titans are the worst class is literally just your opinion. the only place titans aren't usefull is in reckoning. in raids, strikes, crucible and gambit they are kings. nothing beats missile skullfort for adclear. bottom tree striker is a monster now and hammers have always been good.
---
Bungie is one of the few companies thats always allowed exploits that dont directly effect other players (ie: loot cave or this) but they draw the line at crucible cheese (minipulating matchmaking)
---
That's a real sniper fight then.
---
If you got into a 4v1 that sounds like you made a bad play and deserved to get shot.
---
It is already a sniper. Even with max dmg drop off you can still kill in 1 shot with every bolt hitting around 37
---
Nothing beats it? *laughs in Skull of Dire Ahamkara*
---
SRL: Saladin Radical League
---
Wait, why do you know what the last msg i got is.
---
playing crucible with jotunn... yeah, I guess that's ain't right
---
whats it like only being able to adclear once you get your super, and then be useless all the rest of the time? :)
---
Danke. Next goal 20k and after that 50% of life time pvp kills with this fusion rifle.
---
He does sell it today?
---
I've never encountered the knights. I don't think I've skipped weeks.
---
What emote is that?
---
I tried again last night, found some nice dudes in LFG (shocking I know) and had a good time, went up 300 points. I'll say this though, I feel sorry for people who use Crucible as their main source of power grinding because the amount of rewards did NOT feel satisfying haha.
---
I'm using Skullfort. Basically gives you a constant 25% damage buff to your weapon damage. With Skullfort, kills with the Knockout perk recharge Frontal Assault so it doesn't even matter if you accidentally meleed a strong enemy and it didn't die in one hit
---
[removed]
---
Yes
---
The New arc week one, 500 silver
---
Or just use a dark and light stain
---
That explains why cueing for the other forges makes me want to die
---
Have a 51st upvote, my artsy friendo.
---
*sigh*
---
If you're not running blade barrage or nova bomb, mayhem isn't for you
---
oh... so that's why it dropped from the first run
---
how do you deal to the constant flashing on the map or the permanent indicator to go to Banshee while walking in the tower?
---
I feel attacked
---
SSDD
---
It sure does!
---
Only via microtransactions? That's sad.
---
I got super lucky with it. I got a god roll blast furnace and Jötunn back to back. The Blast Furnace has drop mag, kill clip, and snapshot sights with a stability masterwork. The reload time and ADS time is insane with Ophidian Aspect on my Warlock. It’s kind of startling how fast you can go into ADS with it
---
* Shutdown supers and some roaming ones - *if used with a little brain -* can absolutely dunk SB (Celestial Nighthawk + GG, after you one shot him just emote for bonus mental damage).
---
* Some exotic kinetic/energy weapons are really good against it with some space (Izanagi's to show dominance).
---
* High impact snipers / Shotguns both do great damage and if your tammates aren't potatoes they usually trade 1:1 which is good considering you just saved everyone else by sacrificing yourself.
---
* Power weapons (It's always fun to see them flying after tanking a Tractor hit).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
**Spectral tilter = tether, suppression nade**
---
Needs nerf? **Absolutely**,  **it shouldn't be this tanky** and should only reward good flanks and good use of   
---
radar invisibility. **I don't know why bungie doesn't butcher it's DMG reduction.**
---
But regardless people should stop sticking to their comfort zone being crybabies and start findig solution to the problem.
---
If I remember correctly I did it once aswell with a Bite of the fox, but not sure if it was all headshots or not.
---
Kinda, but bungie gotta eat some how
---
Upvoted to tip the balance.
---
I think everyone's just tired of the joke. Like when something doesn't scan at the grocery store and the guy is like "doesn't scan? must be free, huh?". It wasn't all that hilarious to begin with, and then it is posted day after day.
---
Just speculation on my part, I might be wrong.
---
HA! Amazing.
---
It’s like they are pirates...
---
Having a Eliksni class is the dream.
---
Nice. My God Roll Blast was on my to do list last week and managed
---
to grind it out: Rampage/Feeding Frenzy/Stability MW. Managed to get the. Bergusian shader on it too from a Curated drop. 
---
How you found Jotunn ?
---
Get the companion app and put a post up in the clan section
---
It should be heavily. My bad
---
You can use extra control and go faster than Titans used to be able to go
---
Yeah i know. But i don't know. There will be a Void/Solar week?
---
I'm a Devourer Warlock, i would love to get some Void emotes for him.
---
Reported &amp; deported, it's too late for you now.
---
I found Jötunn in Bergusia. You have to unlock all of the forges and then I believe it only drops in Bergusia. I could be wrong on that though
---
Got thunder lord after holliday reset my quest on the last step
---
Hold on guys I need heavy ammo again
---
Same here, voidwalker is my main, but it is arc week, we should have some fun with stormcallers!!!
---
Sorry i wasnt clear. How you found the weapon? Like it?
---
Try https://www.d2checklist.com
---
The sword logic?
---
Vex Milk
---
The light will find its way...
---
is this a real thing or is it cg?
---
But the meme is forever
---
Were you all solos?
---
Hell yeah, we now have one very good ability. 
---
Have you seen bottom tree striker in their super ? It goes on forever.
---
Mean while hunters.......
---
I could see, gold would look hella dope, in terms of a darker stain I have to check (I’m doing this all in woodshop) so I have to see if we have a dark stain, if not I’ll pick some up
---
Oh, let Uldrin have the Vanguard. I'll be too busy Driftin!
---
Feels bad man.
---
The one I did for this week was a lfg and the leader had momentum and grounded on. Holy shit. The synergy of those two to completely fuck you over is unreal. Not impossible, just very frustrating.
---
But that involves helping sloane which is a bad
---
NO
---
Seriously the service revolver is the ONLY weapon that blue fuck will give that is actually useable
---
We just had one in the summer
---
I've forged about 50 weapons total (skipped the last few weeks since I didn't need/want what Ada had), and have gotten a total of 2 curated rolls (Ringing Nail, now Kindled Orchid). I got both forge exotics before the curated rolls, and might have gotten both more than once (I have 3 of each now).
---
The KO curated roll is completely ridiculous (drop mage + kill clip + rampage is obscene), but I'm a bad person to have drop mag, because I compulsively reload, so I run out of ammo crazy fast. I wish I had this gun when I was doing the Thorn quest in Crucible, though.
---
synthoceps and skullfort would be your best friends in terms of exotics. bonus dmg or infinite arc melee
---
For a split second, I thought I saw Vex Mythlocast. Feels bad.
---
My only worry would be too much gold,  but i think it'll work. But i cant say i know much about this stuff
---
Bc its fugly
---
WAIT I DIDN’T MEAN IT
---
When you play a strike*
---
To add onto this, the Bergusia boss fight is really easy. On one of the sides where adds spawn there's a room you can jump into by jumping from a pillar. From there, you can quite easily use Whisper and take out the tank
---
Wait won't they get in trouble with Bungie? That's plagiarism isn't it?
---
\*watches people go full kamikaze\*
---
That’s awesome of you! Unfortunately I’m on Xbox but regardless I appreciate the gesture
---
Pray (also drifter bounties)
---
Na you can hold only one exotic at a time.
---
I got both exotic as well. No Curated drops. Is the mag slot locked to Drop Mag, or is there another perk you can switch to? I'm an absolute impulsive reloader.
---
3 stack combination blow with liars handshake does some pretty good damage
---
No it’s not or else Fortnite (ew) would be drowning right now. The fact is they are two different characters and this was from a trailer he does not actually do this I don’t think...
---
if youre on PC try the lfg discord, if console try the lfg reddit (should be on the sidebar)
---
dang it! Bungie pls.
---
Ho ok then
---
This is what I thought up, vanguards picking lots of scorn chatter from the Cosmodrome and so in response they send scouts to scan the area from super high up in the atmosphere and what they find is something like a medium sized to large scorn army taking over the skywatch/forgotten shore/grottos area of old Russia.  And so what I ends up happing is the vanguard sends two teams of guardians to check out what’s going on down there and what ends up happing is maybe one or two off them escape from the scorn and the rest are going to be sacrificed (maybe it would supercharge the fanatic, but I honesty don’t know if it would).
---
It's a forge from the Black Armory DLC.
---
Believe it is the dreaming spectrum shader.
---
Hmm, which room are you talking about? I'll give it a shot. I usually just Whisper from the spawn point.
---
The issue with Bergusia that I've run into a lot (and it seems like even more since the Whisper nerf) is that no one seems to bring boss-killing weapons or abilities anymore. I'm typically the only one with Whisper, and I end up having to do 50%+ of the boss damage myself (which is fine I guess, since I can use the practice).
---
You can carry a team by just being a semi-competent invader super easily. Even more so in prime where the portal is available more. I'd suggest practicing with a linear fusion or the jotunn/black talon. It makes Gambit alot of fun.

---
It's not just possible, it's super easy especially with taken and/or fallen armaments and a 1k/black talon.
---
Trust me when i say this, worm gods caress oneshots most enemies, oneshots the wanted enemies in strikes (or at least the one i tested) its so fun
---
I think the Curated rolls are locked in general (I could be wrong, but all mine are). You're "stuck" with Drop Mag. 
---
Don't get me wrong, it's fantastic on the KO, but yeah, if you're like me you're going to want a Primary Ammo Finder or something.
---
I’m on console I should through that in the description lol. I’ll check out the lfg’s thank you. I do check the Xbox ones every couple days and I never see anyone doing the leviathan raid.
---
Okay.
---
No. Bad bot. That is a scam site. I’ll come back later with a real site, u/soapcracker
---
Oh damn. I thought it was just Bergusia and Gofannon
---
When did you order yours?
---
You have to actually click on the triumph in your triumph crucible page.
---
Got the code ending in 9mp5. Thanks so much
---
Everyone that says stompees is better never used bones lmao, I really miss bones )=
---
No change blockers have to be just that blockers you nerf them and gambit goes down the drain to being to easy.
---
Service Revolver
---
But it’s supposed to be less likely to get a dupe
---
I wasn’t in a four stack. Solo player.
---
Got it through playing collector and dropping 20 motes in a bank
---
Someone do this with me and my brother and I’ll love you forever ❤️
---
Son the Spider doesn't sell it this week. Or the week before. He probably also won't sell it next week.
---
Also you don't have to really farm, you can go there and do the bounties. They're hella easy and you get 10 planetary materials per bounty. It's like 5 minutes of your time.
---
Yeah I agree, they're too scared. 
---
Do it.
---
If you got over 2100 due to weekly reset points, then you just have to play one more match for that part of the triumph.
---
Keep in mind this is a two part triumph, and you have to win games in Crucible for the second part. Check the triumph and see if you’ve gotten that part done.
---
If neither of those apply, play another game I guess. Sometimes it takes the extra one to let the game know you hit Fabled.
---
fuck every single lmg
---
I was thinking Zavala's packages.
---
True Vanguard made a video on it.
---
To get a specific roll, something like Rangefinder and Rampage with a specific MW is 1 in 13,000.
---
If you remove the MW from the equation, it's still about 1 in 10,000.
---
[That's why it can kick one of the dredgen in the ass.](https://youtu.be/CpTXny73gpw)
---
i feel taken enemies in general should teleport spam less but that's just me. the darkness blast attack on its own is fine, its when it starts going through walls and forces you out into the open that i can't stand
---
you are weird
---
With banking 50 motes, I think it's either Curated roll or nothing. (You do get a collector synth) Maybe banking motes just has a chance?

---
Do t shoot your rockets at the oversoul morons
---
I generally wait till the 3rd envoy due to annoying invaders but currently a good group to have is 2 celestial nighthawk, a melting point, and top tree stormcaller. Top tree with crown of tempest gets your grenade back super fast and crown let's you be in storm trance for a very long time which let's you decimate ads and it does continuous damage to the boss.
---
For clarification, this isn't a loot post but rather a achievement post which falls under the no loot post rules. The end of the week loot/achievement thread will be posted tomorrow and you can put your achievements and loot attainments in there. Thanks
---
Nice!  Yea, I feel like they must have just stocked back up on these cause I just got my Wayfarer one yesterday and I order it months ago.
---
The timer might've ran out before you could land the last shot on the tank.
---
tryna
---
You are overthinking it. 
---
First, you can only get one 'bonus' synth per game. So if you've gotten a collector, reaper or Sentry Synth already, you cannot get an invader Synth. 
---
Second, Army of One or denying a large number of motes will give an invader Synth. Army of One is obviously 4 kills, I think if you deny 30 motes you can get the Synth. I'm not sure exactly as it seems a bit RNG, there may be another medal tied to this.
---
Finally, -Any- time you are given a bonus invader synth you have a chance to get a Curated Sole Survivor. I've gotten it with a Hammerhead, I've gotten it with Golden Gun, I've gotten it with filthy Izanagi snipes. Its RNG.
---
Hope that helps!
---
Sorry, What does any of this have to do with chaos reach feeling weaker? And if your talking about a 3rd envoy that’s gambit prime not regular gambit.

---
Sorry the first half of my post got deleted. I think they buffed most of the primevals across the board so people couldn't just mp and super to death. So it's not that you're doing less damage as you're hitting a beefier target
---
I can't help but laugh every time I get sent flying by an ogre, it's quite entertaining
---
Many thanks from me and my clan, sir!
---
Take risk runner into gofannon, have a ball Guardian! Some of the most fun I’ve had in Destiny ever haha Thank me later.
---
i hope that shaxx mask comes back around halloween
---
man, those ornaments look good
---
It feels like Ana bribes RNGesus to never drop the node weapons you need
---
That’s good to know. 
---
Everywhere I’ve looked suggests a team of 6 and that’s a LOT of micro-managing if you’re not familiar with something
---
You and I are both in the same boat. Just need that nightfall back.
---
You on PC? If you are I wouldn't mind helping you out
---
Hit 700 last night as well
---
It seems like the primeval got buffed in Gambit. We had the primeval buff x10 yesterday and two Nova's only got it down to 1/4 health, used to be able to throw them at x4-5 and wreck it.
---
I've made a habit of doing that with these kind of games where the characters don't' have names or personalities
---
Hunter: Lennox
---
Warlock: Ash-4
---
Titan:  Pard (nickname for Picard)
---
I'm praying for you brother
---
WITCHCRAFT!
---
It's relatively simple, just requires a lot of dps (and esoterickk has soloed kalli with every class, so it's possible. Just insanely difficult)
---
Yea they drop curated in the reckoning.
---
Doing a bounty for a chance of a weapon drop for a chance of an enhancement core after scrapping the weapon seems like too much work.
---
I'd love to see a version of every strike rebalanced for solo'ing, with roughly the difficulty of playing Halo on Legendary. It would give the game a solo pinnacle activity.
---
Sadly, no. I’m on PS4
---
I have D2 for PC but all of my Forsaken/endgame stuff is PS4 at the moment
---
I might have to take you up on that! We done all the D1 raids but haven’t done much raiding in D2
---
Jotunn + 21% Delirium &gt; Ikelos SG + TL IMO
---
Lawsuit on the field, bring a lawyer!
---
One of them screams
---
man, we need some new strikes
---
Wait really?! No lie I had the almost the same luck! I got le monarch. And then did a pulse rifle frame and got Jotunn and a curated hammerhead. With and added bonus of a good rolled kindled orchid. Everyone go do the pulse rifle frame now!
---
You warlock with noses buried in books lack a little something we hunters call "street smarts"
---
You get NOTHING! You LOSE! GOOD DAY, SIR!!
---
but i can shoot fire
---
What did you expect. The only 2 things they ever do is shoot and loot.
---
"Found the crack in the joke, GOT EM"
---
imagine having to actually use guns
---
Type 1 diabetes is a good excuse though. Sometimes my brother HAS to eat, whether he necessarily planned on it or not.
---
or Jez the Titan slayer, slayer of all Titans.
---
Some of the D1 exotics are cool and deserve another chance in the spotlight cough cough bad juju cough cough, but some are kinda just there and were never cool or interesting.
---
Have you ever touched a golden gun in PvP?
---
*Dismantle pigs... yes? Or, you die...*
---
Ye

The quest has now registered as completed, however, I can't claim the recluse from shaxx.
---
Do it........

The power to become...

*L A M P*
---
I know Ogres suck, but you or your mates should kill them, maybe.
---
You spelled the word “character” wrong while condescending about intelligence, yikes
---
What are you talking about, it punches five times really far away.  That's how floaty balls punch with no fists.
---
Stomp e55 were in D1 they are basically useless just saying
---
Sooo... basically exactly what they did with Acrius??
---
(Not disagreeing with you.  I'm just even saltier because they had a great system once and then stopped.)
---
W.I.P going to be painting most likely. Shoutout @coobins for the idea
---
They kill first, wrap them later.

I hope so lol
---
1k voices sound glitch. Hated those times
---
Well, ok? No achivement posts on this sub, please.
---
Wish I could get a kill with my novawarp super
---
That's a nice roll!  Congrats!
---
Idk where I saw it but I read that the issue was from the taken Slayer buff, you could get stacks of it and take off the armor and have the buff on forever instead of the next attack making it obviously overpowered to kill envoys and blockers
---
Can we please get new exotics? Stop encouraging a simple recycling of old exotics.
---
Like he said. Powerful only.
---
No land beyond, a gun that used to be a joke but then became one of the most dominant guns in the crucible.
---
Ive got one of those, but its just not as fun as a misfit..
---
Arcstrider's combo finisher heavy attack can oneshot supers. Way of the Current can block/deflect most supers. There are some exceptions like you stated but it works against many of the commonly used ones like dawnblade, spectral and hammers.
---
Sometimes we wipe...
---
^Exactly this.
---
It's a novelty, having too much mayhem and the novelty would be lost. It's like iron banner, without all the fanfare. It gets people to enjoy more of the content and PvE players to at least dip into PvP. If it became permanent then it would lose its purpose as an attraction into PvP, and become super annoying to play just as u/Godcracker says.
---
Me too!  Anthem gave me the itch to play looter shooters again.  Now I’m addicted to destiny
---
Unfortunately they're kinda rare to get after a match, it's possible, but the odds are really low. You can get 1 guaranteed legendary a day per character from a daily bounty though so that should help a bit.
---
Militia's drops from the Lake of Shadows Nightfall, but that's fair on Mountaintop.
---
Yeah, it’s an absolute nightmare. At one point I got frustrated and tried to cheese him (I found a spot on the wall near the edge of the map you can hop on), but he refuses to change phases to that area if you’re up there. I don’t know how people managed to do it, because it was a pain. It was easier just doing it in a group for me. 
---
NFs and strikes aren’t that difficult once you start doing them and get everything down, they just tend to take a little longer since you’re down 2/3s of your DPS.
---
Welcome to bungo matchmaking! Last night on the climb up from 1k to 1.9k I faced multiple teams where half their scores were well under 1k.
---
Lol
---
Cool, thanks for the answer. How do you get it?
---
Of Hunter?
---
None of the above, its shite
---
Your dad can’t turn it off if you don’t have one 🤔
