I stumbled across it on accident, was heading to eva lavente to get daily bounties and happened to see it in the corner of my screen

1. Shaxx isn‚Äôt a girl. Shaxx sexually identifies as a Bullhorn

2. Shaxx has one(1) horn not two(2) thus, it being *horn* not *horns*

3. Throw more grenades

Ikora does much less, Zavala at least gave me a nice roll on my service revolver. Kill them both actually, I already have my gun.
---
Could not be done with out the other twos help thanks warlocks and titansüòÅ
---
I think what should happen is the factions take over they give nice rewards sometimes
---
I missed a few guns on riven first time I had a team get there. They were so heated about it.
---
What's the curated bad omens? My favorite roll on that is cluster bombs+field prep I don't see the need for tracking. Field prep is awesome because you can hold more rockets
---
They actually could if they tried, Vanguard is only 2 lazy Guardians and a team of hidden hall monitors that reports to Ikora essentially. Dead Orbit has an entire fleet, Lak-shmi can see the future, and the last guy is a king or something with the best shaders.
---
Middle tree gunslinger FORGOT their golden gun
---
Bungie is trying their hardest lol I needed my laugh of the day
---
I‚Äôm a Goldie main and I have nothing against arcstriders unless they use shinobus and revelers tonic in competitive
---
"SOMEBODY, PLEASE! Give this man... *a gun.*"
---
If there's one thing I've learned from skippies, is that Shinobu + skip grenades are great for a shit player like me to solo the Whisper Heroic once with 30 seconds left. Now I need to do it a few more times...fml
---
And from the top.
---

---
And the middle.
---
Yea, I've gotten it from a powerful pulse rifle frame and powerful machine gun frame. Never got one from an auto rifle frame.
---
Oh God hahahahahahaha
---
Bungie tweeted that it'll be fixed with [2.2.2.0](https://2.2.2.0) update which should be Tuesday reset.
---
nice, thanks
---
Nope, not in d2. I hope bungie bring back superblack from d1.
---
Zavala just wants to protect the city. He saw the city fall once, and could not bare to see that happen again. Killing him would do nothing for the story. Do you want another funny character, or a serious, actual down to earth guy who knows what is the best for humanity's survival.
---
For like 4 weeks
---
Congrats!! Wish I had the dedication and fortitude to grind it out
---
Congrats friend.
---
I like my titan. I do. He just doesn't have hunter style.
---
I really like it! Is this yours?
---
Don't lewd the lolis.
---
I have been loving comp playing solo and getting upto 4k was pretty easy during the revelry teams get too used to stacking shinobus and unlimitied invis dodges just shuts that down
---
Why?
---
Was this found in Rasputins archives?
---
This man is using Bandicam when all GPUs have built in recording
---
Plot twist: It ends up being **ANOTHER** Nighthawk.
---
It's ok fellow Titan. It happens to all of us at least once at some point I'm sure. Nothing to be ashamed of, it's like whiffing your nova bomb as a warlock right? ... right? or is this... worse?
---
absolutely toasted
---
Honestly, unfortunate as it is, Geomag does more damage than Nighthawk.
---
My clan did some cursory experiments, mostly in Gambit Prime, Geomag wins out by about 25%. It's kinda bogus that the single skillshot does less damage.
---
Geomag can break damage cap, Nighthawk cannot.
---
Don't nerf Geomag, just raise the damage cap, please.
---
Wait really
---
Yeah. Both Nvidia and AMD have built in encoders which allow for recording and streaming. If you have Nvidia, you can record crytal clear 4k 60 without a performance dip since it uses a dedicated encoder. Not sure the max on AMD cards.
---
I'm not actually. F*ck. PvP. I don't go near it if I can help it. PvP ruins everything. So again f*ck PvP. And f*ck that gun. I would say you too but I'm too tired to even do that. So free pass for you. And remember, do not give Zavala a wig as a gift. Trust me. It won't end well
---
Wasn‚Äôt it Spinmetal? Been a while since i played D1
---
It's even worse when it's the last iron banner of the season, happened to me last month and I didn't complete my armor set :(
---
Yez it was. Tell a lie.
---
So good to see you, I missed you so much. 
---
But seriously, that poor creature.
---
The buffs to top-tree Stormcaller are phenomenal. (Not sure if that's what you were using)
---
It might be the best Warlock PVP subclass trees currently.
---
The super w/ the damage increase per hit is great for melting supers.
---
The grenade perk is also one of the best in the game for PVP. It's oddly satisfying watching those bolts go between players, and then instantly getting your grenade back.
---
ah thanks, guess i'll delete this
---
My bad
---
i have 2 settings for this forge boss:
---
- Sleeper &amp; sleep 
---
- Synthoceps &amp; TASTE MY OTHER GUNS
---
(u can hit him, fall down and "jump" back up with the melee repeatedly)
---
RNJesus absolutely despises me.
---
Or why can‚Äôt we have shields in the game?
---
Go ahead, say it
---
gonna be a damn shame to have to put another hole in his skull - loads ace of spades - damn shame
---
It tells you...
---
The Sonic movie is good
---
she never stops. she shakes like its a rave
---
I was at 1979 last week and so devistated it wasn‚Äôt over. Ended up losing the next two games to get put back to 1870.. but dusted myself off took a break and jumped back in. Two wins in a row and made it to 2020 or so and waited for reset, temptation to play another to get recluse there and then was high but a loss would of put me below 1980 *whats needed to push to 2100 with weekly bonus* Claimed recluse last night... now to bother trying to get lune over the next month to get some use of it pre nerf... hmmm
---
NO! BAD LEN! BAD!
---
Same here! With backup mag and MG Reserves you can get 420 shots in total!
---
*tumble through the window* actually another hunter could have shattered striked it, the debuff is the same but last twice as long. 
---
t. someone that likes his titan but just feel utterly useless playing it outside of pvp where they are broken
---
cheese em with a super or colony or something
---
or just git gud
---
Actually the cap is only visual, you do more than 999999 the games just doesn't display it
---
It's dealt over a very large time so all things considered, Nighthawk would still allow higher dps I think.
---
I was honestly Awestruck at this, good work!
---
I finally got rampage on mine, and I am not going to go for KC as I am sooo tired of trying for it.
---
Meanwhile I‚Äôm getting melee‚Äôd out of my Nova Warp by a hunter :(
---
pogs
---
I think he will finally be how he was intended to be since d1 as the crow. Back before activision made bungie scrap the first rendition of the game uldren was a guy named the crow who was a revolutionary guardian who was plotting against the speaker and traveler since in that story the traveler was evil. Although now im guessing he will just be the crow and be a lone guardian fighting savanthun subconsciously or something.
---
Plus 2 less supers on the enemy team and less heavy ammo. A lot of QP matches feel like I'm just getting supered and hammerheaded  to death over and over. Getting Luna's was way more fun than this.
---
Hmmmm I can see that happening later down the track, maybe after the Savathun DLC he‚Äôll return to the reef to work alongside Petra.
---
LMAO!!!
---
When i pulled out my ghost when I got pushed off it made me sad.
---
What is that hunter armor btw?
---
Heyyyy ive finally found someone who does the same!
---
The base campaign is fairly bad, I'm sure you'll find Forsaken better
---
forsaken is good
---
Nyaah
---
Wipe
---
hahahahaha, this was quality. the things i have done for them!üòÇüòÇ
---
Disagree. Nova bomb has super high damage and all you have to do is throw that thing. The risk for thundercrash is that we have to stand right in the middle of whatever survived(Which currently is most things unfortunately).
---
Terrible rule, you moderators ruin this subreddit with shit rules like no celebrating good drops. Yeah maybe if I was being a dick about getting it and bragging I could see that, but no, I was clearly just celebrating. 
---
So screw off.
---
I think when we went back to the cosmodrome for thunderlord, there should have been just one spinmetal for us to harvest and keep for old times sake.
---
Yeah I hate the mods on this subreddit, they have set days of when you can post certain things, and they remove perfectly fine uploads.
---
I agree, skullfort should be like skull of dir eahamkara. And damage should at least be equal, at least*
---
bruh...... izanami's igniter felt like it took forever
---
Mine is similar, just no tempests. I run enhanced ashes to assets with enhanced bomber and enhanced impact induction on liar's handshake. Infinite healing and super melee with big boi super energy.
---
Props to my man G-Money876 for playing for 8,757 hours in Destiny 2 and 13,423 hours on Destiny 1. 
---
...That's 924 days, so either my man is boosting his hours, or he's been playing for 24 hours a day pretty much ever since TTK.
---
I like getting redirected by an eye blast, while mid-air having been phalanxed, and sailing off into orbit.
---
Werf
---
Simple geography
---
Why is this so accurateüòÇ
---
Yeah! One of the best and most fun to play special weapons in the game
---
I just did a NF where I had a yellow bar Ogre in my ADS, then at the last second a sliver of health Knight jumped right into my reticle as I fired it. I almost laughed, but was more mad than I was amused.
---
But the postmaster.
---
I miss my devils dawnüò≠üò≠üò≠
---
That was beautiful.
---
Dude perfect
---
Bro I need to take notes from you because when ever I start a drawing i never finish probably cause I'm lazy
---
I would love to say that I‚Äôve never done that, but I‚Äôd be lying
---
Melting Point is the only thing we have useful in Endgame PvE for Titans. There are other ways to get damage buffs, and I'm going to be honest, we miss all the time. 
---
*Cries in Titan*
---
Tbh I did quit on one or two. One was the Sunbreaker titan and the other was the Well of Radiance warlock
---
Get to level 30 using Warmind, do Forsaken to get to level 50, do the Power Surge bounties from the Drifter.
---
Since you've not played since Warmind, you might not know about 'Random Rolls.' The YouTuber Datto made a video on this, so you should check that out if you don't know about random rolls. Armor: https://youtu.be/6z9VO7J6C6Q. There's a weapon one you should be able to find easily from there.
---
Shattered Throne:
---
A 'Dungeon' added in Forsaken. It's on a three week cycle, so every third week it's open. Curse week 3 (in 12 days) is when the portal is open. Watch a video on how this works of you want to do it. It's **highly** recommend that you do it with other people. Only the most skilled players can solo it. I have 500 hours and I can't solo it.
---
There's also a Raid; The Last Wish. It's not too difficult of you know what you're doing. Requires 6 like Leviathan.
---
There's a ridiculous amount of content in Forsaken, and it would take me way too long to list it all.
---
The Annual Pass:
---
Black Armory is purely PVE focused, and has added some of the best weapons in the game.
---
By completing the basic storyline of Forsaken, you'll get a 'Black Armory Badge.' Follow the story of that, it'll take you through all of Black Armory.
---
BA stuff you won't find by simply following the story:
---
BA exotics:
---
Le Monarque: an exotic bow, drops from any forge at any time, no other requirements, only a completion.
---
J√∂tunn: a unique exotic fusion rifle, drops from the final forge (Bergusia). You **must** be forging a **Powerful** frame.
---
How frames work: You get a max of 2 Powerful frames per week (per character), by doing the vendor's 2 weekly bounties. You get a powerful frame when you purchase a weapon frame for the first time that week, using the currency you get from the weekly bounties. You can continuously buy that frame again and again using a different currency you get by completing forges with or without a frame, but it'll only be powerful the first time. (Should've put this before exotics, but I guess it's useful for J√∂tunn)
---
Izanagi's Burden:
---
Izanagi's Burden is an exotic sniper rifle, but it feels like it's more than just a sniper. It's exotic perk makes it the highest damaging non-heavy weapon in the game (I'm pretty sure). It's a lengthy quest, and I recommend you watch a video before beginning it. But it's worth it.
---
**Important Note:** With the Izanagi's quest, you'll get a Rare Bounty. **DO NOT** claim it's reward until you get the quest step that says to do it. I accidentally claimed it before the step and had to wait a few months simply because of bad luck getting a new one to drop.
---
Also, I'm not sure if shotguns, snipers and fusion rifles we're still in the heavy slot when you stopped. They use Special ammo now.
---
Black Armory also introduced a Raid; Scourge of the Past. Also shouldn't be too difficult if you and your team know what to do.
---
Joker's Wild:
---
This season is completely Gambit focused, so I haven't played attention to a whole lot of it.
---
Gambit Prime is it's focus; a quicker, different version of the original Gambit. It's only 1 round, and there's a different boss mechanic.
---
The Reckoning is PVE, and is under the Gambit icon in the Director. It has a chance to drop some pretty good weapons, and chances increase every round you don't get one.
---
I'm not a Gambit fan. The only things I've enjoyed about this season has been the weapons they've added.
---
Penumbra:
---
**Nothing has been confirmed by Bungie on this. This is all according to a reliable leaker.**
---
Most likely starting the first Tuesday of June (the 4th), is focused on Calus and the Leviathan.
---
It focuses on Calus' source of power. What is it? Where does it come from?
---
A 6 player matchmaking activity. 'Comparable to an escape room,' according to the leaker.
---
The leaker has stopped at Bungie's request, so all this info could be absolutely outdated.
---
Bit of a long post, but there's lots of stuff to know.
---
*Sees shin malfur has the Dredgen title on* ‚Äúwell this is akward‚Äù
---
I will send it when i get at my pc as well! Thanks mate
---
Bruder muss los
---
This is why you never upgrade the last perk
---
It is a pc platform clan right?
---
 Get a higher level piece of gear for the same slot and infuse it into the 10 power piece. 10 power piece jumps to the same level of the higher level piece, and the higher level piece disappears.
---
No it‚Äôs not confirmed, previous cycles should be ignored bc of the annual pass, take things with a grain of salt
---
They can‚Äôt throw skip grenades if they‚Äôre suppressed
---
Bruder sag blo√ü
---
Full. Titan.
---
Oh, I didn't knew about changing the apperance of gear, good to know.
---
Weird. Well whatever it was, it definitely did not make it to my inventory!
---
The "true" golden gun. This is amazing!
---
This (besides the original) is the first to actually look like an accident. The guy with the phalanxes was asking for it lol
---
Does it show 17 on your character screen?
---
Nah. This is done too well to be called that.
---
Just an FYI, you replied to your post rather than the comment on your post. So that user probably won't know you responded to them.
---
Exactly, they said it will be fixed next Tuesday with the update 2.2.2
---
Where are you getting 17 from? If I have everything Notorious except for the helmet (which is Outlawed), that makes 14.
---
I used shock and awe for this reason but recently got an erentil with backup plan, sadly no under pressure though.
---
You can get a decent printer for under $300 these days, and that's including some accessories and a good amount of filament.  If it's hard to justify that amount of money, you might want to look into all the productive things that can be made with them, and if that might save you money in other areas by making your own replacement parts and household tools.
---
Grabbed a point? You literally contradicted yourself saying first that it would be toxic as fuck for bungie to listen to the backlash from the community then 1 reply later said its ridiculous if bungie disregards player feedback
---
Just think about what lmg‚Äôs would do if an entire team could pull heavy from a single crate?  Pretty solid choice, imo
---
Br is not at all in line with what destiny is so NO a thousand times
---
Swords definitely dont feel like a heavy, they should be special.
---
Yeah and like you said it makes it perfect for countering shotgunners.
---
Darn it, I'm PC/NA...well at least I offered! Might try r/fireteams if you have trouble finding a group, also.
---
CG is what inspired me 
---
:)
---
It‚Äôs so OP that it‚Äôs not even in the top 20 most used weapons!
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm pretty sure. At first I thought it was an Edge Transit, but when I looked closer, I saw that it was actually an Edge Transit
---
Can we do something about taking it out of pvp
---
Looks like euridium from borderlands
---
I seriously had to unsub from it, that's how I found this one
---
so this is why my clan mates didn't want to use sleeper in our petras runs... i always wondered what could happen.
---
"Never gets as good stuff" skull of the dire amakara and geomag
---
Ive been wanting a traditional ace tattoo but havent seen any great ones. This, is incredible. But alas, a custom piece for you so I must continue my search lol great work
---
Go to settings, and then hit the switch profiles button. Reload in on your same account. Bam. Fixed.
---
I want this now.
---
repost no dignity
---
It was for the solstice of heroes.
---
I just got hard light and trust me the ricochet is real
---
Solstice of heros armor set. You are not able to get it right now
---
It's probably an incredibly small increase like 2-5% which is also the rate for EP weapons IIRC. So after your 12 rounds your chances should have increased anywhere from 24-60%; not sure if it resets when you leave the mode but that'd be pretty asinine seeing as how 90% of players dip out after one round.
---
Don't. Just dont
---
Yes if you‚Äôve played 3 games this week and didn‚Äôt quit any of them
---
?
---
I played 30 comp games this week
---
I didn't know about this until now.
---
Then you‚Äôre good. You may have to play one game next week and win or lose you‚Äôll get it.
---
This is accurate until the bonding part. Everyone knows the eldest and youngest are the closest. 
---
Source; dude trust me (one of 3 boys, friend is also one of 3 boys)
---
I hope not lol
---
Cuz I heard it gives u 120 points or 150
---
I was able to easily transition into bumper jumper because of my experience in Titanfall 2. Bumper Jumper for life.
---
Nice, how did you get them to level 50 besides the first one? I want to level a second/ third one but I feel like leveling is real slow
---
This meme template is the best thing to come out of the Sonic movie
---
120. A buddy of mine just did it this week. He was at 2050 last week and waited
---
Yep, Y1 D2 where shotguns used heavy ammo
---
How much did he you end up with
---
 and then do a phone screenshot, I used a picture collage maker app on my phone to put the two pictures side by side, I didn't include my Titan because he's only 687 lol I just tried to make sure and crop out any personal info, this sub only allows screenshots or official captures of you gaming system, I know because I tried to submit a pic from inside my living room last week when I completed my Iron Banner armor set and the page manager asked me not to do that lol #eyesupguardian
---
Kame
---
With crucible and gambit, when you cap out your valor/infamy at legend to can reset them and start over.  On PC you go to the map and select the activity and press and hold F.  I would imagine it's something similar on console. You start back over at Guardian and go back to getting gear every time you rank up.  There are also certain quests and triumphs that require you to set your rank a certain number of times to complete.
---
I've never used Vigilance Wing, but I've seen it fairly often.
---
Simple geometry
---
Unfortunately just had to power through them. As soon as I got them to level 50 I move my highest power level weapons over to make a journey to 700 a little easier
---
This sure brings back a lot of memories
---
[deleted]
---
Yes. I look at skyboxes a lot, especially the ones in Mercury, since it‚Äôs my favorite planet
