This has been a thing since the game came out it‚Äôs because near him is a scannable item for some lore
---
---
---
At what point should I get Forsaken? Should I finish whatever I can of the main game or it wouldn‚Äôt make much of a difference and I should get it now?
---
How about quit bitching and buy it or dont. Swear to god this sub is the most annoying place on the planet.
---
Ahhhhhh here we go. A comment you said yesterday: "people have different opinions." Wooooow. Look at that, you're also contradicting yourself as wellüòÇ
---
Well, it will be around 30 below your level, but you can infuse it with a armor that you don‚Äôt want.
---
You deleted the post because you're afraid of other peoples opinion, ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Then when you're backed into a corner you insult me, outstanding move chap. Continue with the denial that you're just plain better than me.
---
I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd call myself a fully paid player if you‚Äôre missing an expansion pack.
---
I deleted the post because I realized, yet again, how toxic and ignorant the people of reddit are.
---
Did they actually?
---
Yeah honestly there need to me be more earnable ornaments
---
Yeah, that's why I bought it. I looked it up online after I made this post and it said a reward was powerful gear. Themoreyouknow.gif
---
So long space cowboy :,)
---
V E N G E N C E  X 1 2
---
Cool thanks man üëç
---
Yeah but it's hard as fuck to earn bright dust 10 per repeatable bounties and 100 per weekly bounty
---
Yea thats true too
---
Not contradicting, sure this is you're opinion, but I can also use my *opinion* to tell you that in my *opinion* you're wrong.
---
I like to use a lot of politeness I guess???
---
Look at yourself. Its pathetic. You have to take jabs at everything you can ap that way you can seem so much better right? Why else would you bring up irrelevant as shit such as xim? Fucking loser. Go occupy yourself with something more productive.
---
There were no vendor resets this season so that armor should still be available thru crucible packages as 2.0 armor.
---
When is a hand cannon one shotting anything except precision hits on thralls and weak acolytes?
---
If you made it a 2 shot kill, there would be no reason to ever use it. [Here‚Äôs a video](https://twitter.com/iamcoolguyyt/status/1183085462610690051?s=21) from CoolGuy on how to fight it. Essentially just step right and don‚Äôt ads
---
It's the second time i see this post it's like dude there's kids around here and honestly this is fucking disgusting. Wtf !?
---
U get the NF quest after u get Luna's howl
---
You fucking idiot. Holy shit fo you know what opinion means? Telling someone they're wrong IS NOT an opinion. It's being an ignorant, condescending asshole. But hey, this is all you've got right? So you can have it and enjoy being the miserable toxic fuck that you are. Have a shitty life friend
---
Indeed
---
You're continuing to comment which means that you still think you're in the right. I brought up the to back up my point that your BAD AT THE GAME  you have to use an adapter because CONSOLE PLAYERS ARE KICKING YOURE ASS
---
This has to be the most headass post I‚Äôve ever seen bro. In what world are titans slow and we have some of the BEST supers for pvp lmao
---
I just played Gambit normally and got the medals now all I need is the kills which I won't go for
---
I'm on PC I DONT USE AN ADAPTER I USED A FUCKING ADAPTER TO GET PREPARED FOR PC WHEN CROSSAVE CAME OUT DO YOU NOTNINDERSTAND THAT YOU FUCKING IGNORANT IDIOT?!
---
Eh i guess i dont know enough about the the game to supply a response to that üôÉ
---
Keep on commenting, keep on waiting your time it sure isn't valuable to you if you've got time to waste.
---
The rewards ARE pretty shit. I want more planetary resources than what we get.
---
Contradicting again! You're wasting your time too you fucking waste of life.
---
True tbh i forgot about that, i guess they both have their attributes
---
Second time? It gets posted a minimum of 6 times daily. More than that right after Shadowkeep launch. Meme is so fucking tired...
---
Is weekly story mission that strike? That chance every week. Tought its week long grind mission sounded awesome
---
deleted
---
ü§£ü§£ you are so cute defending your self you have nothing to defend your self, you're one halarious bloke you know that?
---
Any tips and tricks? More and more people posting it so I might have a crack at it as well.
---
Get the catalyst and have fun
---
You need to do the NF quest with luna, thus you need to get luna in order to get the NF quest.
---
Having a single codebase for several components of the game streamlines the development cycle. Having to write a separate input method validation system, as well as changing where the game starts loading user data will have a massive impact on complexity.
---
TR3-VR is doom incarnate.
---
Luck in the chamber would be nice
---
Not contradicting, because right now I don't view my time as valuable unlike you
---
I had to turn down the music during the campaign bc it was giving me anxiety lol.
---
I used xim on console. CONSOLE. I USED it to PREPARE for cros save so that I could have some practice with keyboard and mouse. Idk why that is so hard to grasp for your stupid little brain c
---
Yup, and shoulda thrown in an emblem that tracked hoe many packages you collected.
---
I‚Äôm debating on doing comp. is it pretty sweaty. I‚Äôm pretty good with being accurate but I feel that   Comp is filled with sweaty titans using mountaintop,recluse, OEM, one punch, etc. I‚Äôm a hunter main but I play all characters but I‚Äôm not a meta abuser and I don‚Äôt like playing pvp.
---
If you keep playing, you'll get the dialog
---
I honestly don't know roll but r/sharditkeepit can
---
Nice. I got thunderlord from a crucible match and felt very very lucky
---
Not a glitch bud. It means that you have seasonal mods for Submachine/Auto rifles.
---
***Don't you put that evil on me***
---
Dunemarchers are a really good and underused exotic
---
Oh my god
---
Yeah, i know. I played a lot of conquer and i guess i am decent. More wins than looses for sure and 2-3 KDA. So, kinda weird
---
Iron banner is best for achieving the winning part of the achievement. You need to win 20 games so iron banner is really useful for it. IT IS NOT helpful for glory.
---

---
Getting to fabled is pretty easy, even easier if you make a lfg post and get a team.
---
Ok, still worth it then.  Thanks for info.
---
It‚Äôs the basic before 1500 mark issue, I struggled to keep a 1 kd ratio because the team mates split and do stupid stuff. Once you progress enough you‚Äôll get matched with solo q teammates who are smart and know how to play just get 2 mates to get you 5-6 wins and you‚Äôll be fine to drop in solo after that
---
I had a mate stand on a balcony under the map so If I died I wouldn‚Äôt wipe haha
---
Wow THANK YOU
---
From my knowledge, just gaining xp in any activity will let you complete the battlepass. But you do need to buy the dlc to get access to armor and weapons that came out with the according expansion. Sounds like you cannot complete that triumph.
---
Cheers for the info mate! Few people mentioned that last night.
---
My screen looks so much better now I've been told
---
Dear god
---
Ik that building is fortnite and that‚Äôs why I hate the game. Even when I joined in December on 2017, when building was super rare, I still found it annoying. I couldn‚Äôt care for build battles honestly, I saw one and it‚Äôs just meh. Also fortnite‚Äôs mircotransactions arent that bullshit. I never said there where lootboxes, instead there are $20 skins, but what I don‚Äôt like is how the community clowns on 4 year old kids who don‚Äôt have skins. They are basically peer pressuring kids into buying the skins and it makes me feel bad for them cuz they won‚Äôt know any better. Ik it‚Äôs not epic games doing this but it‚Äôs just so wrong.
---
I ONLY solo-queued so I understand your pain lol
---
Don‚Äôt get health back when getting super kills, and it costs more to use the dash attack in super, and you get less super back when killing people. and they didn‚Äôt state what they are doing to OEM yet, just said they know it needs changed.
---
Yep
---
Absolutely. There is still tons of content you can do without forsaken.
---
No. You must avenge Cayde.
---
And the only way to get it is with the **dlc**?
---
Sad thing is once they‚Äôve done the quest line, objective play goes out of the window. Most people only want the 50/50 captures then its GG
---
Did the same thing then got terrabah on first crown clear.
---
Thank you very much for your reply.  What would I need to do to generate glory?  Would that be winning games in a different playlist?
---
Unfortunately mate.
---
This was beautiful, and truly speaks to me through the performer‚Äôs soul.
---
The depression, anxiety, anger, and finally the happiness found in acceptance. Accepting the harsh reality of how royally fucked the odds can be sometimes.
---
Bellissimo.
---
Just got stuck on this same patrol.  "Learn from Shuro Chi."  And nothing happens.
---
Shame. That blows :(
---
shame
---
Ummmm gosh that's a good question. I guess if you are big on storylines perhaps wait and finish the main game. If you are more of an endgame player it might not hurt to get forsaken/shadowkeep right away. I honestly don't know a good answer for you though
---
It's a joke. Normally masterworking a weapon will give it small, like 5%, boost to one stat. Shows up as yellow. This gun is notoriously OP yet other barely used guns have recently been nerfed.
---
I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be on sale in a bit
---
These things terrify me
---
This would also work with Shaxx screaming when you get an assist
---
So having lunas quest will activates NF quest
---
What‚Äôs the emblem for?
---
Bruh
---
How get?
---
Also shaxx when I get an assist kill: YYYYEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSS
---
I hope that [this](https://www.shacknews.com/article/114391/all-powerful-gear-tiers-and-sources-in-destiny-2) will help you to see how to get stronger gear.
---
Very true...I ended up caving in and buying everything because of it.
---
Ah OK. Thanks.
---
Ahh good thing that can never be acquired again
---
Finally a titan meme I can get behind
---
I knocked the Giant Ball off the tower while like 5 people were trying to stop me... Sorry everyone im a terrible person
---
Nah, it‚Äôs such an op perk, people will just dust rocks for the instant or Titan slide 1 punch man your ass to the other side of existence and then switch and continue on like normal
---
Id say the one on the left is better
---
Nearly as good as the legendary sword sword sword sword sword sword sword sword sword sword sword, slayer of glory ranks
---
*giggles in slowva lock*
---
When titans try arguing their melee isn‚Äôt strong I‚Äôm just going to show them this
---
K
---
Lmfao
---
Oxygen Sr3 is still better
---
no I'm confused about how the Sentinel missed THREE TIMES.
---
I didn't check for another meme like it before I posted, probably should've checked before. Sorry if I offended anyone
---
DTG is just a salt Mike lately. The rest of us are too busy having fun to bitch.
---
Pssh... you aim?       
---
Noob!!
---
Cheesy weapons are and will always be a part of IB, your other points are completely valid, tho.
---
You can get 6 so far 4 initially and when you compete them you get2 more.
---
Even worse when I found out that buying the dlc gives you a free season pass. And now that I have the season but not the DLC it's even more expensive for me because I don't think I get anything to compensate that.

Gimme gimme gimme I WANT IT!!!
---
No problem! I did for the longest time until I looked into the word and what it was referring to.
---
I prefer ‚ÄúOof Orb‚Äù
---
That is my current favorite armor set. Lookin‚Äô fly.
---
One Eyed Mask in crucible is one of the most rage inducing exotics to play against
---
Sounds like you already bought the game! Hehehehheehe
---
Ah the name of my tackle box and fore play skills.
---
its too much humiliation being punch to death while in super
---
Yeah I got it after a fair few tries, I'm on console, and it was just kind of annoying at first, especially after it resets back to the start each time
---
This is coming from ‚ÄúR1SpamDotCom‚Äù
---
Exotics can pop out of anything, higher chances with tougher foes
---
But does trust require forsaken
---
Let me get an Amen for NOT BOTTOM TREE GANG!
---
Simpler.... the armor sets is all i play the game for
---
I got the game free due to a sale on PSN dumbass plus each expansion I split the cost with my friend plus the advantages of working rather than leeching off people in a basement
---
I dunno they‚Äôre all usually shit from my experience, at least on PC
---
It was a good run, sad that we can‚Äôt have fun things for more than 2 weeks whereas every other class can have free reign with PvE for seasons at a time. I hope it‚Äôs still viable or maybe they just flat out buff peregrins to where it could be even remotely viable.

To do the Nightmare Hunt bounties and certain Essences can only be got from certain bosses in the Nightmare Hunts.
---
As far as I heard Ace of Spades was considered a really OP weapon in the past, got nerved and still is good today. 
---
The catalyst is wonderful to finally get orbs and even has a nice small addition. Would they have made the catalyst stronger, people definitely would have said that the Ace is OP again
---
Most probably just means Annex in braille, then again which person who reads in braille can read that sign?

That's cool but are you sick of people posting... Finally got it posts? I know I am sick of seeing them

There's a Twitter account dedicated to destiny steam usernames.

Plastic lmao
---
I‚Äôve noticed this tbh... in my case it‚Äôs mainly quests not registering... I completed the nightfall the other day, only got the achievement today... I think it could be just buggy.
---
It‚Äôs the new eververse armor ornament set that you have to buy with silver
---
I don't think that should be happening. 900 being the new soft cap you should consistently be looting gear that's higher than current. Although for some reason I occasionally loot a 750 legendary and I'm 955.
---
Or, and hear me out here, create a team of players that want to take their time when running The Ordeal.
---
Turn radius, useless on PC, CSU‚Äôs should know DPI
---
No problem man, hope you get the exotic you got the skin for.
---
New light and getting Flashpoints to appear.  
---
Google says; "*Once you've completed the Destiny 2 campaign ... Cayde-6 ... will give you the weekly Flashpoint Milestone objective.*"  
---
Okay, out of the 63 quests that I have going on, which is the main campaign? Is that doing all three of the old storylines from Amanda Holliday?
---
But you are still awesome !
---
Titans have T-Rex arms and Trans penii.
---
Verdant crown and mal gold
---
sorry im a noob but where is that?
---
Where is what? The tower
---
I know I wish we could get touch of malice back but alas not yet at least
---
Yeah that should be the next mission. You could try reloading the destination and or game?
---
he may have to speak to someone
---
Director, Vanguard, mid, should have a option for nightfall the ordeal, 4 power levels, 750,920,950,980 iirc not aon destiny atm, the 750,920 are matchmade, you will need (or your team mates) artifact mods for the champions (anti barrier/unstoppable) should be easy enough depending on strike to get passed 50k. Think this week is inverted spire strike, haven't played it yet (iron banner...) so expect barrier hobgoblins (damage them they pop a barrier not the usual flames) this barrier can only be broken with anti barrier mod on weapons, and unstoppable minotaurs, extra health, don't stagger and don't give up attacking until you kill them.
---
Give it a go, most ppl bring at least one of the mod weapons with them, so if your teammates can break barrier/stagger the unstoppable and you unload with your heavy hitting gun you should be able to complete without issue.
---
This sub: durr recluse OP
---
Also this sub: being back old whisper of the worm!!
---
Personally I think the drifter is the worst choice. If you side with the vanguard youll get a full variety of voicelines for the drifter when you play Gambit. From "Snitch!" To "Snitch". And lets not forget his best success "Snitch"
---
OP plz nerf
---
oh ho wait till u get to the strike
---
Oooh ok, I'll switch that up to a Scavenger mod. Thanks for the tip
---
I completely forgot about that üòµ shit was crazy
---
legend of acrius is the closest thing we have to a BFG cannon
---
Yes it is it‚Äôs a 140rpm so it‚Äôs a little more forgiving if your on pc that is
---
[Don't need anti barrier mods if you can kill them fast enough.](https://i.imgur.com/djI0wid.jpg)
---
It deletes their house
---
Yeah I finished that on my other guy, but Ada didn't give that to my Titan...hmm I'm missing something super simple x\_x
---
oh and another question,If i reach "Legend" before i make all my kills but then i derank from legend,do i have to get legend again?
---
So today I got to season 20 or so, and claimed my prize but thought ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember clicking them all‚Äù went back and had two engrams unclaimed. 
---
Now i have a new ship and a chicken that I pet
---
Trials of the Nine. Going for flawless. Last matchup. Every. Damn. Time.
---
You can hit legend first then derank and still get it
---
Right as I bought doom,perfect
---
alright you've been a big help
---
I use it to grind glimmer when I want to chill and watch something. Got a completed the Cerberus catalyst from there. Only thing worth farming there is glimmer or catalysts, and it's faster to buy glimmer honestly.
---
Np
---
You have joined the elite, we are above punching things, or pole dancing supers, we are space magicians, with terrible melee recovery.
---
Hunter Master Race, but in all seriousness play whatever class you want. I do suggest making all 3 classes at some point.
---
I‚Äôve been warlock since the first D1 Beta and honestly I can‚Äôt find myself playing any other class extensively. You just get so much freedom as a warlock, especially in Destiny 2. 
---
Like going for all out add clearing and dealing some damage? Novabomb the room!
---
Wanna be Emperor Palpatine? Zap everything you see like Nikola Tesla on crack!
---
How about literally flying with a flaming sword that can make an invincible area or shoot giant flaming waves? Yeah we got that too! 
---
But yeah I feel ya Warlocks are hella fun lmao
---
You look like a martial aid.
---
Honestly we have Vex Offensive weapons, Moon weapons, new Raid weapons, and three new ritual weapons
---
Thanks, guys! I have Kindled Orchid now.
---
Bruh idk what your problem is but I‚Äôm just giving a tip, no crying here lol. You have a bad day?
---
Just out of curiosity.. could you make them shoot nerf darts?
---
Thank you!
---
If it‚Äôs the only exotic you didn‚Äôt have then it did the right job since fated engrams are meant to give what you don‚Äôt already have
---
This is where I'd put my One-Eyed Mask... if I had one! By the time I get that thing it will probably have been nerfed to hell already.
---
So a kung-fu teacher?
---
I'm actually loving the mode.  I've never been a fan of Crucible though due to all the abilities.  But it is kind of like those rare games where a team goes up against a player controlled boss (I think the upcoming Predator game is like this).  I can live with the unskilled kills in Gambit.  I grow frustrated in Crucible.

Warlock since day 1 D1.
---
nope XD
---
It‚Äôs a game but I mean at the same time it‚Äôs a movie lol. Pretty cool idea wise but kind of meh in terms of gameplay
---
It‚Äôs chaotic evil at times when a bubble decides to run double suppressor grenades
---
Welcome to the Warlock ranks! I‚Äôve been here since the beginning of D1 and I‚Äôve been warlock all the way. I‚Äôve tried the other 2 and while each has their strong suits, I have always stuck to my lovely Exo Warlock. Hope to see you on the battlefield guardian!
---
Wait, that‚Äôs Divinity‚Äôs perk! You can‚Äôt just reuse perks like that and get away with it, Bungo!
---
Reminds me of my favorite game sleeper roulette
---
True.  If they made them masterwork or high tier rolls that would be nice.  Masterwork could at least be dismantled into guaranteed materials, for those of us that need them (like myself).
---
For me, glory rank and sub rank up loot was insanely good for light levels, but no exotics. Got my Titan geared pretty fast just doing comp alone. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like that though. RNGesus must love you. Hope you got some good stuff!
---
no he only wants people that have 20+ clears
---
Just did that, finished in an hour from 30% pretty damn good, just annoying to get there.
---
The essences that provide guns, the harder difficulty nightmares can drop shotgun and other rare weapon essences.
---
just wait for reset, bonus glory will carry you over
---
I had the day off today so I sat myself down and just ground it out. There was so much frustration but in the end I‚Äôm glad I got it out of the way now instead of later. Bonus: I finally finished my Jade Rabbit catalyst!
---
It's a weapon specifically for boss melting. It has the highest DPS of any weapon by itself. If you want one heated for PVE get Prometheus Lens. None of them are suitable for PVP.
---
What the hell is that helmet
---
This is so untrue it hurts. It might be the most popular looter shooter, although Borderlands 3 sold a hell of a lot of copies at first, it's not the most popular mmorpg (because of the existence of WoW) and as an fps it also has incredibly strong contenders (borderlands 3 again), although destiny's shooting mechanics are better.
---
Look I love destiny 2 (been playing since day 1), but your stance doesn't help the game improve. I think it's important that people can criticize what they love. I do think sometimes this sub goes a little far, and some people don't know what they're talking about, but complaints and the dev's listening is what keeps game communities healthy. 
---
Hell the main reason I'd say d2 is doing better than bl3 is because gearbox are fucking up the balance and longevity of the game, thereby decreasing player interest
---
I think he just wanted to point out a floating enemy glitch. I doubt there's much more information, but I could be absolutely wrong.
---
You can literally grind out fabled in 2 hours in freelance.
---
Unfortunately almost every quest line weapon makes you pvp one way or another.
---
I mean..... I love destiny, but fortnite exists. Destiny is good, but it's neither the most popular or dominant game in the market right now, that's almost certainly fortnite.
---
Thanks for the info man. From the couple Public Events I‚Äôve done it definitely melts boss enemies very quickly.
---
...those goddamn machines won‚Äôt even stand a chance....
---
I'm new to reddit so is this a r/woosh situation?
---
Titans definitely have more well-constructed perk tree than the other classes imo. Lots more meaningful perks and synergies like Frontal Assault, Sun Warrior, Defensive Strike, Tempered Metal.
---
I think the Way of the Pathfinder rework with Heart of the Pack was a step in the right direction, Hunters also had Chains of Woe. Warlocks, I think they condensed all the good perks and synergies into the Devour tree lol. I hope they keep going and give more, or maybe even all the subclass trees something nice that impacts gameplay and synergizes like those.
---
I‚Äôll stand in front of dregs and thrall screaming ‚ÄúHIT ME!‚Äù waiting to proc arc conductor and my girlfriend just looks at me wondering where she went wrong in life, she never says anything but I can see it in her eyes lol.
---
The big problem is the exotic sniper bug.
---
I fucking love pinnacle whipped vodka. Mixes great with fruit punch. Now I want a drink.
---
Yes.
---
Yeah it is pretty annoying to get there
---
I love it. I‚Äôm doing it rn but the only thing is it‚Äôs kinda tedious. Well worth it tho
---
What is the nerf?
---
That is kinda lucky. I have played lot of crucible and i have got like 10 exotics.
---
Just grind until you get a good roll on the pulse rifle, I used that and huckleberry. Can mow down anyone at range and as long as your aims okay you'll wreck people up close with huckleberry.
---
once again... ITS HUNTER!!!! not huntress!! we dont call male warlocks warmales, or female titans titress. Hunter is like human, thats why we say my female hunter or my male hunter. Awesome artwork btw
---
Yo, i'm a 1.8 k/d player and this is just what i've observed and experienced in high level play. Most of your wall-of-text is complete horse shit and honestly I don't even know what your point is anymore.
---
Nice

I think you can do that if you chance fireteam privacy settings ? I'm not sure. But solo can be added as another option
---
Sure it wasn't for the Linear Fusion Rifle?
---
Heroic 3
---
Do all your tier 1-3 weekly challenge engrams. 
---
They have a decent drop rate for exotics. That is where most people got monte. Just doing flashpoints. 
---
Got my monte from the first exotic engram in the season pass. 
---
But I also had every exotic in the game prior to shadowkeep. And the game always "tries" to give you an exotic you dont currently have. That isnt just a fated engram thing.
---
It's still there dw
---
lol that ig post only got comments saying moons haunted. Im so proud of this community
---
I haven‚Äôt run across that issue.
---
Wow didn‚Äôt know this forum would go so low just to get a little chuckle by making fun of people concerned about a communities behavior.
---

Remember when the gun only rolled with one set of perks and Better Devils was the best hand cannon we had?

Hello, Cousin.

(Recently finished Forsaken.)
---
You can hold your own against keyboard and mouse users with a controller, the aim assist is generous.
---
Either way I don't see the problem when Crucible is an afterthought and there's so much PvE content.
---
If the cosmetics were earnable in game it would absolutely affect gameplay, it would be incentive to grind certain activities. The point is they‚Äôve taken stuff we used to earn from playing and put price tags on them. We shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for a harpy ghost. Should be able to earn it from the raid. Can‚Äôt believe you guys are defending this.

Pillager, it drops from gambit. All gambit guns are good tbh.

Stop you are making me miss radiant dance machines.

---
That was back when the only other end game was leveling up your exotic weapon tediously so you could actually utilize the abilities it boasted of
---
It‚Äôs been copied alot
---
Got a blue off a yellow engram once
---
It's not for resetting rank, it's for hitting legend at 1800. You just reset at 2000.
---
Looks good man! Hard to recognise a titan without OEM üòú
---
What are the blue shields players sometimes have around them in pvp? I was just playing comp and all my opponents had these shields like every single life, it made them ridiculously hard to kill. I've been playing a bunch of crucible, iron banner and have never seen those shields that frequently.
---
You're living in a fucking fantasy world lol
---
i already did this is also a crosspost and i made this set over a month ago
---
How do you get the catalyst for recluse?!
---
i made thiso ver a month ago but i know those are y1 dawning legs
---
Not even just d1 vets, frankly any vet
---
&gt;  then buy the Fated Engram.
---
this is the important part
---
here's a fun game
---
1go to bungie net forums
---
2 make a post
---
3insert weapon is op/too weak
---
4 screenshot all the idiotic replies like people saying golden gun is the worst pvp super
---
It's a short, from a collection called the Ballad of Buster Scruggs. Definitely worth a watch!
---
drifter is god confirmed, and he‚Äôs had enough
---
I have 1 Intellect mod and 1 nightmare mod, but mods dont increase the base number
---
The mods give +10 when you look at the number, so your roll without any mods is actually 60
---
When you are at the destinations directory and you see a yellow star over a destination it will say powerful gear drops as a reward. Like the vex offensive. The gear itself doesn't say it. Powerful gear is destiny's way of saying "this gear drops at higher light than anything you'd usually just find". That gear is also a reward at the end of completing whatever stipulations are behind it. Like the crucible; completing 4 matches will drop a powerful gear reward after completing 4 matches. So that gear also does not continuously drop either, it's a 1 time reward until the weekly reset on Tuesday. 
---
Also, any gear you get with a stat total of 55 or over is generally considered good. But it's dependent on what stats you like. If you want your super up as much as possible, find gear with high intellect. If you want higher armor, find high resistance gear etc. Also, exotic (yellow) gear is not always good. Some pieces just straight up suck, even if they have high stats. You can find videos on YouTube that say "Titan exotic tier list" or "warlock best exotics". Mtashed is good at going in depth and applying real world scenarios, datto provides a lot of statistics and figures for them usually. Both are very informative YouTubers.
---
... Didn't had it.
---
It should be a separate node activated from orbit on the edz destination
---
So painful... But I'm going to tilt you beyond measure here. I didn't buy gjallarhorn from xur but got it the next week as a random drop.
---
How does dismantling the mountaintop even factor in to this situation? lmao
---
Grats!
---
lol, dvd cleaner, talk about ancient technology
---
Aww mr.blueberry thats a nice thought but this is a GRINDGAME you have to carry your friend through the Game to get him some loot.
---
thanks for the answer, just to clarify tho: own the exotic as in have it in my inventory or just have it in my collection is fine?
---
pop team epic
---
Why not a glorified wiki ABOUT pranking guardians in the tower?
---
I lost a couple hundred points due to a 5 streak loss.  It was enough since I only play about 5 matches a day.
---
That statue really looks like Nerthus from WWII Nazi Zombies
---
XD
---
‚ÄúTHIS IS AMAZING!‚Äù
---
It might get competitive eventually but no those don‚Äôt fall in the same tier as other competitive players.
---
Average console player, doesnt care about objectives and just goes for kills.
---
I took this exact screenshot and have it as my pa4 background
---
Sorry for not specifying, the hand cannon. I‚Äôve only been playing crucible for about a month now and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm that skilled
---
/r/unexpectedshaxx
---
This is an awful take. Destiny has way more nuance to it as a PvP experience than something like CoD.  CoD is very barebones and the nonchalant playstyles of CoD won‚Äôt get you far here. You need to better master your weapons (for the most part) and learn to use your abilities if you want to excel here. CoD has none of that. Its just run and gun. 
---
Destiny used to have a competitive PvP scene in D1. And there still are tournaments and scrims and stuff like that.
---
Yea the hand cannon was what I was talking about, also there‚Äôs a shotgun?
---
Wow... How long did that take to put together?
---
We weren't expecting special forces.
---
Good Luck,Guardian
---
Funny you got downvoted but you're speaking straight truth, except I believe CODs multiplayer is way easier and unless you play "hardcore" you can survive multiple shots to the face.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
---
I‚Äôm using the hand cannon, you get it from doing a few missions on mars if you were wondering
---
&gt;this isn‚Äôt like fortnite or overwatch where cosmetics are not as important. 
---
lol what? They‚Äôre the exact same thing in all 3 games. Cosmetics. They don‚Äôt have ANY effect on  gameplay. They‚Äôre just there to make you look cooler. There‚Äôs absolutely no problem with a game offering something like that. If they straight up had guns in loot boxes that carried an advantage, that‚Äôd be a different story.  
---
As far as I‚Äôm concerned, there‚Äôs nothing to bitch about here.
---
Playing destiny on pc is cheating as if playing destiny in ps4 or xbox with mouse and keyboard. You have it easy pc players.
---
New players that don't know what they're doing, on your motion tracker they show as blue balls.
---
Who built the tomb? The Vex?
---
Bs there are even blue smgs which feel the same just without the +33% damage and feeding frenzy
---
Glorious!
---
And the shotty can be paired for recluse. Best shotty for thost little hunters
---
I second that. I played solo comp from 0-2100 yesterday and every match they came in they had less then 5 kills all game. (Pc)
---
For me, it means I am about to be disconnected.
---
Put a yellow skin on the helm and boom you‚Äôre a minion
---
Lol someone only now discovered sweet business. Its been in that build for ages.

Well played man.

Don't need to be communicating, its called not being a dick when you see a rocket launcher, lol.
---
Yeah, I thought it was a waste of my valuables... I never got the gjallarhorn till year 3
---
Think what ever you wanna think, but his roll don't fit his gun. His gun has a too low reloading speed for his major perk. This isn't shit, but if he jump into an intense activity, man he will just switch for a weapon with a better reloading speed.
---
Instead of using this weapon, i would rather recommand to farm the Gambit weapons. They have a way better reloading speed with mostly pretty decent and coherent rolls. They may not be top tier, but they are useful as fuck !
---
you should‚Äôve gotten the quest from Banshee after starting the Forsaken campaign

I just redid the strikes on Mercury. If you're lucky, some of the enemies in the strikes were hives. One time, the entire Infinite Forest except for the last area was hive.

&gt; weapon is required for the Season of the Undying
---
The SEASON collection &amp; SEASON title require the SEASON pass? That's a massive fuckup? You're complaining because you want the season title but don't want to pay for the season? Do you get mad if you want to see a new movie but you can't because they lock it behind a ticket paywall? Do you realize how ridiculous this sounds? 
---
If you can't afford 10$ for 3 months worth of content then you shouldn't be playing video games at all, you should be doing idk even know what, but certainly not posting on reddit either.
---
My warlock is higher power level than my Titan atm ü§£
---
I enjoy the auto rifle with Overflow and Rampage.  Absolute pve ad clearing machine.   Add breach refractor to a piece of armor.  Add anti barrier rounds to the gun.   You have grenades for days.
---
That‚Äôs what she said...
---
Warlocks are Warlocks maybe you need to stop running your face against walls dude
---
Bottom tree striker is a pain, mid tree hammer is where it's at. Much more fun to shut down spectral and void warps in one slam
---
Spectrals I agree and I've used Nova Warp against them and yeah didn't well for Titan in question lol
---
Someone in that toxic wasteland of a subreddit told me unironically that it's bullshit cuz he wants his guardian to look good but he doesn't want to pay for it. Motherfucker do u steal the clothes you wear? They're just cosmetics in a fucking video game, if you're breaking the bank to buy them then you shouldnt be buying fucking cosmetics in a video game, let alone even playing a fucking video game. man that sub pisses me off.
---
I think you‚Äôre misjudged what I said, Most free to play players buy stuff in game if they enjoy the experience do u know how much stuff I buy in free to play games like Warframe and skyforge? People still spend on games they enjoy but why pay for ps plus when the games u play don‚Äôt require it and all content is freely open to all players? Dude look at fortnite it‚Äôs a free to play game no ps plus required why do people spend so much on it? It‚Äôs a great game and me and my friends were going to spend on this game but because of the devs rapid disregard for non ps plus players Am not spending any money till content becomes available for everyone DLC is totally different i don‚Äôt expect free DLC I just want to complete my missions and not feel locked out of content. It‚Äôs not that hard of a fix all they have to do is remove quest that forces strikes and raids and replace the objective with something every player have access too. It‚Äôs that easy if they want to impress us non ps plus players.
---
Against striker or burning maul? If a burning maul can't take out a void warp that's a bad Titan üòÅ
---
Playing Destiny since D1 launch taught me to never expect much in the story department.
---
Burning Maul and it probably was a bad Titan then again I used Astrocyte Verse and jump UP charge and then CHIPOTLE over them
---
eh tbh ur right,
---
I can relate to that playing mainly a hunter that usually uses the void tree.
---
There was no need to block me
---
Thanks. I hate it
---
Did you finish all the other steps of the quest?
---
This doesn't work mate. Pinnacle rewards will be 950 max unless you are 950 light already. Tried this myself
---
Dope video. Shoutout black skinhead
---
The triumph requires 2 things: To reach Fabled and to win a lot of Competitive Games (idr the exact amount). Even when players complete those steps, they don't get the recluse. In order to fix that, you just got to log out and log back in.
---
you killed All Might you monster
---
I'm aware other classes using it but there's nothing more than obnoxious than OEM strikers. I should know, I play a Titan main.
---
I hear if you do that, it kills you.
---
Had no idea that was a step. All I heard was reach fabled. Is there a way to see my wins?
---
Yeah it's in the triumphs part under crucible subsection glory
---
No it‚Äôs not pay to win.
---
That song makes it absolutely unwatchable
---
Lol I‚Äôve been doing this it‚Äôs especially fun when you see it get super close
---
imagine sounding like this much of a pompous bellend over the way you've arranged some pixels in a videogame
---
Oh wow ok had no idea I had to get a certain number of wins. Thank you
---
I may be an asshole but I dont raid with people who can't communicate. I have in the past and it just caused more problems than was worth.
---
you need forsaken for seasonal exotics such as outbreak just fyi
---
Do you know how many I need?
---
He‚Äôll be sleeping more than all night
---
Who wouldn't, but connecting titans and toaster is a no go for me pal
---
amazing!!!
---
They had Forsaken, I should have put that.

She quietly looks over from her desk across the room. Pauses her work. Gives you a stare. Not an angry stare, but one which she ponders the red flags in the first few dated she ignored. My gf does the same. For them, we're worse than the football fanatic boyfriend yelling at the coach to call a kickoff.
---
look at the triumph you require for recluse the quest will tell you which one (Iron banner wins also count for it)
---
New Light player here, can you gimme armor name and shader?
---
If it makes you feel better, I've been playing vog in d1 every week since d1 launch and I havent gotten the mythoclass yet
---
Wow, 63 stat
---
I Googled it but apparently you need about 100 wins. 1% increase per win or you can try Iron Banner which I think gives 3% per win.
---
Yeah, Be 946 - that's the trick :) If you are above delete some items to get back to 946.
---
i am by bar more pvp than pve.  pre shadowkeep 1 win and 1 loss was basically equal.  the matchmaking is a joke and it groups players that are no where near the same glory level.  freelance is only based on the outcome of the team, why even have it?  thats what non-freelance is for?  if a team loses in freelance your position should dictate how much you lose and vice versa for wins.  why penalize/reward everyone the same in "freelance"?.
---
Thoriom holt set looks like they tried to make a warlcok out of a frame but forgot the frame part... now I wish that set look more robot like
---
Are you talking about during a mission? You can mark waypoints for public events and where to start a mission. One of the strike modifiers some days is blackout, which disables your radar. I don't think you can have a marker on besides looking at your radar or pulling out your ghost.
---
I got it last night, it was frustrating but fun.
---
Ok thank you. I just think it's weird that I cant see a bar for that or anything...
---
im upwards of 3.5k and thats the scoring ive seen, 68 for a loss and 40 for 1 win.
---
Think about it like a point system 
---
For every 10 points on a stat, the state levels up a tier(can lv up to tier 10)
---
For example for mobility, every tier grants u 4% base speed increase. 
---
This piece gave me 
---
+10 mobility= 4% base increase
---
+20 resilience= 1% Shield capacity increase(more Hp)
---
+16(only 1 tier lv up) Discipline= faster grenade regen
---
+13 int=faster super charge
---
You can get an SSD for Xbox?
---
"I'm calling this one"
---
Every time I hear that gun in pvp I go the other way. Lol. Not today satan
---
Get better. I know its harsh but I struggled for a long time and still do. Re order moments in the match where you die and look back at them. See where you can change things. Also, I find my games and match making are better at certain times of the day. I work shifts and keep odd hours so when I'm matching Asian clan tags at 3 am I know it's time to stop.

Capcom does the best cross over events with Monster Hunter. We need a Doom crossover event on Mars!

What class are u?

Omg I just got a 64 stat gauntlets

Yeah most recent season character is king crimson

I couldn‚Äôt think of anything else but that. It is scary to run into

Just disconnected as you posted, happens alot. I am playing with friends on the same Wifi but nothing happens to them

I totally saw you yesterday around 2am. Didn't notice you the first time, then went up to you, then you walked backwards and vanished.

My heart will go on :(

---
Not all of them anymore, isn‚Äôt Randy‚Äôs Throwing Knife just full auto with rapid hit?
---
Yes, I got the fallen kills done (fusion rifle kills can wait ; absolutely dislike using fusion rifles)
---
No, it's bad that the public event is NOT made heroic, 9 out of 10 times anyways (some quests require many non-heroic public event completions, and in those rare instances where players are trying to get completions for these making the event heroic and thus increasing the time to complete the event can be slightly frustrating). You get significantly less rewards from normal public events compared to heroics (even though you barely get anything now to begin with).
---
Mainly because I was a Titan main all through Y1-Y2 up to Shadowkeep üòÅ

I had a clan mate Titan with (I think) his Dunemarchers on be fast enough to pull all the levers in order to open it.
---
Just now I got the "weasel" error code and the game crahed on the Shadowkeep screen.
---
Oh thank you. I see that now. I thought that seasonal armor was eververse armor.
---
Yeah man not putting down the idea it‚Äôs the best that I‚Äôve seen so far but reckon it just needs a good old nerf (this is coming from a recluse owner btw just don‚Äôt like it‚Äôs op-ness)
---
But it it only happens when I play for more than 3 hours.
---
I don‚Äôt watch DBZ so I am a little unknowledgeable
---
I mean it makes sense. Uldren stole ace from Cayde, so getting it back requires beating Uldren.
---
Nice. That was the last raid I did. Spent day after day hours at a time trying to beat it lol
---
Actually, it's a player in your instance that's not part of your fireteam. Randos that show up in your instance appear in your radar as blue dots (blueberry) and your fireteam shows up as green dots.
---
The term blueberry has nothing to do with newness of the player, but whether or not they are part of your fireteam.
---
Enemy kills are accounted for; it‚Äôs the frames being counted toward progress (doing the frames that require the ballistic log) and didn‚Äôt count. 
---
That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm wondering if Bungie derped on lacking info towards the Butterfly‚Äôs Grace/Giant‚Äôs Might quest requirements. 
---
Gonna try the frames that need the ballistic logs again on the weekly reset.
---
Yeah, this game is beautiful.
---
I was using an auto rifle
---
Not true, moon set looks great and so does the iron banner set imo
---
u/VredditDownloader
---
Doesn't need a nerf, for chrissake
---
  
---
Y'all need to shut up and grow a pair
---
Quit ruining things because you don't know how to play a fucking game
---
God
---
Bad English, let's try again. When are you supposed to stop dismantle every item you don't need any more, until you hit max light? Or are there items with let's say 100 light less that still can be viable because of some sort a perk or something
---
Won't dispute that.  Just thought I'd propose a way to nerf rather than cry nerf.
---
Would love to see what you think to do with it though.  Decrease benefit?  Make Master at Arms harder to use?
---
I hope he sees this.
---
I think on paper the way it would pan out, and this is very simple and I'm sure it's much more dynamic than this, is if each ability gets reduced by 3s for it's respective trait than each ability would get reduced by 1s for the universal trait
---
This is due to a bug with Galanor and Gambit Tiebreaker Matches' Mayhem-esque Super recharge buff. You can do this without Divinity.
---
Oh really? I didn‚Äôt know that I only got them yesterday
---
what platform?
---
Depends on your interpretation of "an absolute joke". You can try to solo Shattered Throne (there's even a triumph for doing it solo and/or deathless, respectively). There \*may\* be some Raid fights or Nightfalls you could try to solo but at that point idk why you'd wanna stress yourself; there's no real reward for doing those things solo.
---
I personally enjoy running Malfeasance; it‚Äôs decent damage and has very minimal recoil, plus with the exotic perk, it‚Äôs about 3-4 body shots and the chain explosion sets off and kills them. My crucible go to at least.
---
I'm not a huge crucible guy but waking vigil with opening shot and slide shot are good.
---
Forges are on a rotation now. Look on earth map for the forge of the day.
---
System?
---
Loot is still RNG, but killing all of the champions greatly increases chances at receiving the best loot posted as rewards. So just keep at it with the champions and finish it. You will get awarded every other nightfall or sometimes twice in a row if you are lucky. Killing all the champions is the key. Time really is not an issue to what I‚Äôve seen.
---
Having fun may not be your shtick
---
easy to test
---
why the sparrow isn't behind our guardian on the preview screen like it is on the character screen is just incomprehensible.
---
Yeah. Their effect is a bit underwhelming elsewhere, though.
---
I‚Äôm following the Gears of War and Battlefront 2 sub reddit... if you want nothing but complaints and suggestions, those are the places to be. It‚Äôs ridiculous
---
It should be in collections
---
Sorry you‚Äôre having trouble completing it. One more thing it could be is that all the frames have to be completed on the character with the quest. It is not cross-character. I did a frame on my hunter and it did not progress the pursuit on my warlock.
---
Would have been smarter for this season cause of all the hive.
---
No you're just over reacting. Those boots haven't been a problem just the combo. Like how liars handshake wasn't the problem just the combo
---
Thanks for the tip!! :D
---
Thank you
---
Yeah, do it! Play with some friends, solo queueing can be awful.

I watched this so many times

I‚Äôve only been queuing up with friends, we‚Äôre all tryna do Thorn at the same time lol

"melee and shield throw" Shield throw is your melee ability so if that kills things that count as melee kills.

Friendship ended with OEM now Dunemarchers thunder coil is my friend
---
Anyone have a link to the original comic?
---
Only if you think the perks are good by none Exotics.
---
Play Campaign, Strikes Etc. and use the new things you get until 900 (hard cap is higher) and infuse them in you old Exotics ( I believe its easier to infuse you only need some cube looking things)
---
Idk
---
Agree since queenbreaker and LoW is in having all three would be good. Side arms could use a little TLC anyway.
---
I think it needs to be gambit prime/reckoning
---
I‚Äôve been playing for two days (a lot of play time already though) and I have the drang. Is it a really special weapon? The power level and stats are worse than another piece of gear I have.
---
Ok thanks
---
Wrong. Its there.
---
&gt;How the fuck would he give you proof without deleting his characters.
---
Video evidence of someone else doing it? Confirmation from bungie?
---
Have you played the dungeon yet? Or the heroic offensive? Or the two new exotic quests? Master nightmare hunts? New pvp mode? Raid/challenge mode?
---
Awwww is the little titan mad that their broken class is getting nerfed? Awwww you poor poor thing
---
Haha I never thought about selling this, but I could totally turn it into a print! I just ended up giving it away to a close friend who was all hype for the new Destiny expansion :)
---
I would try either the menagerie or the lectern on the moon to force an on level drop
---
Yeah pretty much, I dismantle my legendarys as soon as I see there bad but that‚Äôs just cause I know rolls, I would recommend looking it up and going threw those before you reach max vault capacity
---
If you really want to piss him off, tell him titans are easy mode in Destiny 2. For an actual challenge, try a hunter. 
---
Full disclosure, I'm a warlock main that occasionally plays hunter, and only plays titan when the other two are caught up. Because titans are overpowered.
---
OOF
---
I also didn't get a reward from completing Warmind. Just finished it and got nothing
---
The second picture is a Sith Lord.
---
Got one yesterday (2 if quest rewards count)
---
What the fuxk did you summon in this cursed land
---
Bounties/lost sectors/completing story on three characters
---
After the update when i log in in my account my character is basicly full power but i still havent played that much i was still lvl 8 or something and i cant do any story (looks like its completed) what is going on?
---
Yeah lol a lot of then look similar to that
---
ok i can get on in a few hours
---
You haven't really lived until you did crucible with 2 shotguns.
---
Goes through knight and phalanx shields too!
---
reinstaling windows didnt help -.- i hope next update fix some problems
---
Are you a kindergaurdian? What from my comment implied I'm a titan main?
---
Go to blackops 4 forum a few months ago. The only people left are diehards because that game is such a mess. Their forums were the most toxic thing I've ever seen. These posts are close, but lack vitriol.
---
That would be the hunter Wrath of the machine raid armor set named ‚Äúnanomania‚Äù 
---
I really miss doing that raid :(
---
Ok thanks, that should make things easier
---
You aren't wrong, but at the same time that situation makes everything hard to dodge.
---
Aim is everything. I have recluse yet prefer my claws of the wolf. Some people need a crutch, others need shit to cry about. As is the destiny way.
---
damn that was close
---
Survival wins get you 3% increase. N if I'm not mistaken, Iron banner wins are 5% increase. After you finish there step don't forget to claim the triumph

A 1/4 mixture of Vex milk and bleach (respectively), works best as a suppository.

Imagine thinking the word "blueberry" is exclusive to one game. And blueberries in Destiny aren't just new players, it's any random.
---
Gotta blur out other people's names.
---
Another thing I witnessed, and then promptly joined, is people would crouch and walk slowly towards a guardian who is in a menu and then spam crouch to "teabag" and surround them while doing so. If you're lucky, they'll join. We got a group of around 20 guardians to do it before people got bored and left.
---
Would also be interested in an answer for this. I haven't done any raid since D1 and would like to start from the ground up with all of the Legacy Raids. Hovering around 960 light or power level, whatever it is now lol.
---
Yeah ive tried 2 of the 920 ones and 1 750
---
The five of swords doesn‚Äôt work with the ordeal
---
Bro what‚Äôs her @ though
---
As the other commenters said, take Telesto off. I didn't know they disabled it temporarily.
---
I need to know how you're damaging the boss
---
If you don't know how to kill fallen walkers you just have to shoot the legs and then a crit spot will appear on its neck
---
What's the bug?
---
Man, you're getting downvoted for this. Classic Reddit. Me and my one upvote got you, fam.
---
The missions were fun but the actual cuts scenes and story was pretty bad
---
It does look pretty stupid, I‚Äôm with ya
---
Rip to those like me who can never hope to achieve a single title...or pinnacle weapon...or raid...or anything endgame
---
Yeah just had an amazing shotgun game, did everything the same but this time the shots registered üòÇ
---
You've got a whole season to get it, just chill.
---
Better find God quick! ü§£ü§£
---
Update: it has gone to 874
---
how far where you in the quest line on moon? because i don't it it will drop unless you are pretty far.
---
Long as it aint hammerhead. Im damn tired of hammerhead. At least sniping takes a bit of skill.
---
Bunny hop. Mountaintop. Recluse Recluse Recluse Recluse Recluse Bunny hop Mountaintop to reset repeat. Ya totally balanced. FOH.
---
I attribute 99% of that to feeling I was drug along by my Ghost through that entire story.
---
You do know that you get teleported out when you kill all 4 enemy guardians. 
---
It doesn't matter how much time you have left l you will always get teleported back to your side when you get an army of one medal
---
Knowing my luck it'll just give me 9 boots
---
It also runs the fun having to get 500 kills to get the perk
---
I hope
---
Nope its rng. Terrible rng at that lol
---
Oh shoot so i have to do the base 820 nightfall?
---
Stab her in the neck and take it
---
ULTRA KILL
---
I know right, there is like 50 days left. Lol.
---
Ah, another man of culture I see.
---
Lmao maybe exos tend to look similar
---
Insta respawns with 0 lifes left in survival?
---
I think the public event meme is out, and its replacement should be people who join in on Vex Incursions but don't bother helping with the final incursion boss and just kill ads so it ends up timing out.
---
They are i just find it boring seeing the same one over and over.
---
Raiding in general is a six man activity. Completing a raid with only four players, even for seasoned players, is very difficult as most encounters are made for six man teams. I would either use a matchmaking site like lfg or The100.io to find two other players who could help out. Good luck!
---
This is sooo old. Bit still good
---
O M G it said red legion
---
You monster.
---
If you go into the exotic page in the collections, it tells you how to get them. It will be something like
---
Source: completing X activity/quest
---
Dude I had someone bming throughout the whole game didn't matter figured it was just people being people then he messaged me afterwards heated for some reason talking about how I was trash and that he was so much better but he ended the game at bottom of his team with a 0.27 efficiency so I just laughed him off and he got mad and shut up. Ultimately people will be people and I always appreciate people who will just emote back and chill
---
Yooooo, why am I‚Äôm seeing this now ? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Take off telesto
---
went from 200 to 2100 in less than 24 hrs playing freelance survival this weekend. last season i gave up when i breach 1900... each win was almost 220 valor and each loss was a mere 20-30 loss it was infuriating but the eziest its ever gonna get
---
No you do the nightfall on the far right of the playlist. Like the old nightfall playlist
---
I stoped playin destiny for a while after forsaken lol
---
Beautiful
---
I wish your right hand luck.
---
It's just getting the iron banner set that's the problem. It's pretty much impossible for me to complete scour the rust
---
honestly its not the best in raids it takes up the exotic spot for useful weapons like whisper, lzanagis :p
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
this was pre shadowkeep and my first last wish run lul
---
How do you hold so many bounties? I‚Äôm capped at like 15
---
Imagine thinking people smurf in destiny
---
It gives you a full super if you shoot projectiles with a grenade lol
---
I like the implication of Drifter being god.
---
X box
---
Thx
---
Quests stack with bounties. There is a maximum number of quests and bounties you can hold.
---
No problem. It‚Äôs a super fun way to play the game. To be honest The Red War campaign is pretty bad. I think as of right now the best way to go through as a first time player is to do what you are doing until you hit Mercury. At that point head back to the Tower and start the Curse of Osiris campaign. Complete that, go back to free roaming until you get to Mars. At that point start the Warmind campaign. Once you complete that free rom again until Tangled Shore then start the Forsaken campaign.   
---
The first two are decent but Forsaken is one of my favorite campaigns that I‚Äôve ever played in a game. The story is cool, the bosses have unique mechanics and really feel different from one another, and the environments are pretty cool. Especially once you start your journey to The Dreaming City. Curse of Osiris has some really cool environments and some awesome ‚ÄúOh shit!?!?‚Äù moments too.
---
Do you know how often they rotate?
---
alright thanks alot ill do that then
---
With my riskrunner it‚Äôs about 700 crit to the legs, once the neck spot opens it about 1200, keeping a dreg or 2 alive gives us arc conductor for no reload, that‚Äôs 3 riskrunners doing 1200 a shot with no reload plus using supers
---
I applaud your self-restraint. Every a bounty is complete I'm compelled to click on it immediately.
---
Cry cry cry
---
-Awesomezauce- you are a thankfully intractable sinew!
---
What‚Äôs a disabled weapon?
---
I just did mine, and it wouldnt instantly recognise i had reached fabled.
---
After i changed location a few times then it dropped in.
---
Yeah, but if you lose, you only lose like 20 points and if you win you win hundreds, so, it‚Äôs not that bad.
---
Say......what?
---
What is that cloak? I'd wear that just to flex on the peasants.
---
Yeah
---
Those are the campaigns I get from Amanda Holiday in the tower?   
---
Why is Red War bad?  I haven't done any of those campaigns yet, wasn't sure about what power level I needed to be.  
---
The discovery quest will give me the order of planets to visit right?  Like I have one now that says Titan, and once I get there, it should change to the next planet right?
---
Thanks for all the super useful info, will do exactly as you suggested...although I may end up doing Red War just for giggles.
---
Hey guys, my laptop took a big ol‚Äô shit and I can‚Äôt afford another. Maybe I‚Äôll see y‚Äôall in a few months. Have a good time.
---
Even hotter take: you play as *one of those cool janitor frames* occasionally seeing Guardians pass by on their way to interesting story adventures.
---
This exotic in D1 always brought up the question, why can't we just pick up the gun of any enemy we kill? I know now, but back then I was fresh off Halo, and in one of the d2 promo's zavala kills a vandal with its own sword, uses a fallen spear, and is a badass with it, so why can't we
---
Someone did me that with a hugüò¢ so mean
---
Ya they are specifically talking about one eyed mask, which I am clearly not even using in this clip? 
---
Without OEM all the classes are pretty balanced so in not sure what your problem is.
---
I find them kinda content-light.  The way I remember it, they talk circles around each other the entire time.  And from the beginning we know Ghaul ain't getting chosen and the speaker doesn't actually have a line to the Traveler.  The whole line of cutscenes just serves to stall the final fight.
---
LOL!  I'm new to D2 so this is funny.
---
Thanks, ha the old school way. Didn't even think of that. I just deleted the damn folder. Need to make room for red dead.
---
2chainz has two of those chains.
---
So you think he‚Äôs too sensitive and decide to belittle him to try draw on it... I think I‚Äôve spotted either a troll or a narcissist.
---
Just gave me the option to migrate no uninstall option.
---
You can do that anyway with the sweeping emote ;) we just need a local voice chat so you can have a real sweeper not experience
---
They disabled telesto. Equip something else in your energy weapon slot.
---
I don't know why I am here, I only know that I must \*punch\*.
---
The last mission has you literally fighting through the city with other guardians to get to Ghaul. That's literally what you just asked for lmao.
---
If like to see a third guy in the background likd "Hey guys, a little help with this boss?"
---
dog i pulled the meanest denial last night. 4 goons, all with 15 motes, smashed all of em with my super in like 5 seconds. wish i'd have recorded that shit
---
Disabled it for now

Oh why

Combine with a bow w/ quick access sling mod. Good times.

I think the next exotic is gonna be the kinetic trace rifle I've seen people ask about, it just seems like somthing we need
---
ah, the old tf2 method of playing video games
---
weapons designed specifically for killing
---
I see
---
You should be able to buy it back from collections as long as it was masterworks or legendary I think... I thought they did that...
---
Fuck, that's such a brilliant idea. I gotta try this.
---
Hearing about Oryx and his sisters(?) is fucking crazy to me. Like, such a cool little detail that one of the writers must have thought of early on that they could have just thrown in.
---
Like, the squad fixes up a ship and dives deep into the system's ocean to find some worm gods who gave them powers but it's not until thousands of years later that anything is recorded again.
---
Apparently there is a glitch or something with it that enables infinite supers or something along those lines. Bungie couldn't deal with it so they just disabled the gun.

I don‚Äôt get it.  Why the hostility and why are you getting upvoted?
---
He doesn't give exotics anymore for a completion.
---
Yeah there is a section where other Guardians go through the City with you and you just happen to be the only one to get to the ship and absolutely buttfuck Ghaul.
---
Weird
---
That When Face
---
Weird it was on D2 Where it used to say play it said uninstall for me. You must not have completed the migration
---
I've been using it since a friend suggested it awhile back. Still my main build. Little awkward in pvp at times, but I have experienced the very situation in this image. Tore through that barricade. XD
---
bruh just now I find out about this
---
Red War just feels poorly written and executed. They basically take all of your light powers away just so that you can slowly gain them back again. I also personally think that the Cabal are the most boring of the factions.   
---
As you gain enough experience to unlock the next planet it will open up that planet.   
---
And yes you trigger all the campaigns from Amanda in the tower.   
---
I will say though that if you decide to do the Red War the final fight in it is pretty fun. Other than that though it‚Äôs just pretty mediocre. Most of the environments are just Cabal ships.   
---
If you‚Äôre enjoying the discovery aspects of the game stay away from Strikes until you have completed all of the ‚Äústory‚Äù content that you want to see as some of the Strikes will take you through portions of the game that you would experience during the campaigns.
---
The changed it so you don't get any free exotics in the old stories. Same with osiris and warmind.
---
Here's the Bungo link, thanks for your votes! :)

Restart destiny, should fix it......maybe.

As someone who saw their friend take their helmet off for the first time yes, this is in-fact what they look like.

I feel bad for the hunter he probably needed the high five because he‚Äôs probably had bad comp matches

It's glorious

Ight that was pretty fucking good. Seeing those streamers faces when they realize was gold
---
The telesto was disabled. Switch it out and your light will go back up.
---
Thanks, man of culture.
---
My old school was really shit so the power would go out for about an hour every couple weeks. It got REALLY annoying hearing them scream every time, it got to the point where some of the guys and a few of the girls would immediately yell ‚Äúshut up!‚Äù As soon as the lights went out to keep it from happening.
---
I mean goddamn it‚Äôs not like the room is pitch black, it gets slightly darker and they lost their shit. The difference in lighting was literally that of a cloud blocking the sun and they acted like it was now pitch black and murder was in the room
---
This
---
You can, but the subtitles will be in Japanese as well. Unfortunately, you can't have subtitles and audio in different languages.
---
They disabled telesto, put something else in there and it should be fixed.
---
Oh please god no
---
Depends on which story you‚Äôre talking about
---
You have Telesto equipped. It's been disabled because of a bug, so it's not contributing to your light level.
---
Was it the old system armor or 2.0 cause banshee  can give you your solstice armor as 2.0 if you've got the legendary ver done before the event ended. He will only give it to you once though. (Talking about the latest solstice gear)
---
well, i have the same problem, trying to find people to play with cause tired of that semi single player stuffs, just add me on steam "Coffeediction", if we get enough, might even start a raid or so
---
Haha soo funny üòÇüëåüòÇüëå
---
Yep. With a lot of supers when I die to it I just kinda throw up my hands and go ‚Äúokay then, what was I supposed to do.‚Äù With Golden Gun though I feel like they have an advantage, which a super should give, but not one that I couldn‚Äôt have countered if I was good enough/if the opponent wasn‚Äôt accurate.
---
Infinite super with botttom tree and grenadier
---
Between your own characters
---
Good to see she chose the right class... Warlock for life!
---
How long was your vacation?
---
Not really sure on the relevance but I‚Äôll take it that you agree as there‚Äôs no counter
---
Damn..
---
I love how you just accept your fate
---
The one shot however isn't a 100%, you either need a light advantage (iron banner), them to be shot once by just about anything (not a one shot anymore), or you need to hit them at just the right angle to launch them into an object fast enough to do a little extra damage and finish the job.

How do I do that? What‚Äôs running whisper?
---
Middle tree knives + Sealed Ahamkara = what is reloading anyway?
---
Actually real lmao
---
Guess that explains why it's disabled.
---
So just an idiot. Gotcha haha. Thanks!
---
Hey man I‚Äôm struggling at 4000 with the same issue, I get put against unbroken players while my teammates are barely at my elo( I‚Äôve checked countless times)
---
WHO MADE THIS üòÇüëåüíØ /s
---
Did you get your package??? Then stop complaining.
---
Then they could disable it for pvp.. A large, experienced companies only solution to an exploit existing being disabling it for all play is very pathetic. I've played most competitive games, and never seen such a horrid solution to balancing.
---
This is the same as an MMO just denying access to all warrior class characters, because they have an abused bug. . That's not how things are ever handled, because it's ridiculous.
---
You didn't have to do it to em my guy

---
Hey. Don‚Äôt worry about it. Doesn‚Äôt make you any less of a gamer or anything.
---
Warlocks don't have a one shot melee? Extended range sure which you can use a shotgun with to get more consistent kills but the only melee close to one shot is the middle tree void and it only hits about 90% of the health pool of someone on equal light. Also Hunters have a little extra mobility while punching, they don't need 1 shot melee. Hunters can jump and melee at the same time which teleports their hitbox up and down making them very hard to shoot (This works best with strafe jump due to the initial acceleration).
---
Thank you! I ended up winning the next game for a 10 game win streak to FINALLY get Not Forgotten. The grind...is finally over
---
Oh I know man, some people just get all extra over stupid things now (life in general not just games)
---
it‚Äôs a quest, i don‚Äôt really remember where you get it but it came with warmind. i highly recommend running it with a full fireteam (it‚Äôs timed and rough). after completion you‚Äôll get the whisper of the worm, a really cool sniper. and run it again to get the catalyst. and THEN run it again, this time looking for hidden chests, and shooting oracles in a specific order. 
---
it would be wayyyy easier to google it and watch a video, i know my description is probably a lot to take in.
---
Both actually lol. Was like 5 matches in a row. Then I re queued and we were right back at it.
---
Sorry for asking this I'm a new player. If I use Celestial night with bottom tree will i still get 3 shot or 1 ?
---
Oof
---
Imma beat people to death with their own ripped off hands
---
It's not whining it's feedback and suggestions on ways to improve the game. It doesn't need to be a serious issue to be improved
---
To this day the only enemy that makes me shudder and panic when I see it
---
Huh. So Bungie added in a supply drop sorta thing?
---
Exactly. Idk why but there‚Äôs something seriously wrong with matchmaking it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs rigged against you
---
How do you get that?
---
As a titan main I say go ahead and nerf it. I run middle tree lol
---
Titan crush? :l
---
You can also buy some new ships from Amanda Holiday at the tower. She sells some basic ones for glimmer.
---
Only 1. It‚Äôs super high damage though, so if you hit you shot it‚Äôll be worth it
---
You'll only get 1 still. 
---
But it will do a huge amount of damage.
---
This is where you put the, "Why are you booing? I'm right!" meme.

Did you just put mountaintop and balanced in the same sentence? Lol
---
Oh, I‚Äôve seen this one before...

I think **yes**

Melee most likely counts as punching, technically swords are weapons.

Lol.

Here's [an overview](https://www.shacknews.com/article/114391/all-powerful-gear-tiers-and-sources-in-destiny-2) of reward tiers, maybe it'll help you.

Pfft I have the app open now! I create multiple lfg fire teams and clog up the system within 3 minutes we‚Äôre back on with 3 new 950 guardians who seem chill in party and all know their shit. Manage to clear the encounter we were stuck on for hours üòé
---
It really is.  It's like foetracer and wormhusk for hunters put together and its effects multiplied by 3.   Wormhusk was op for hunters in warmind for maybe a season?  Wild OEM is going on it's 4th.
---
I'd recommend Beloved Sniper (From Menagerie), Outbreak Perfected, Thorn and Last Word. The last 2 aren't the best but they are really fun to use.
---
I actually just got that in 4 hours yesterday. Just a lot of matches but eventually if you lose, you lose like 10-20 glory points
---
Yeah I like it too haha, it's a solid double meaning
---
‚ÄúGood work, Guardian. Your light is strong‚Äù -Shaxx
---
Yep.
---
same problem. i cant get the gun :)))
---

Good job man, it‚Äôs definitely a hell of a grind
---
Did you just say thorn ?!
---
Same hour delivery.
---
How? I‚Äôve gotten nothing but weapons from IB
---
Because he isn‚Äôt right the Legion isn‚Äôt at all comparable to Amazon in terms of shittiness
---
Hate it so much. Takes 2 seconds to bank before invading
---
I am trying to return as well. I know I was not quite done with Osiris last time i played. I want to pick up where I left off. Unfortunately it seems I can't. I have no idea what kind of thought went into just putting the player on the newest expansion if they purchased it right away instead of literally where they left off.  
---
I only even found this thread literally in the process of googling how the hell I'm supposed to finish my Osiris campaign and move into warmind, then forsaken, then finally get to shadowkeep. I see now based on OP that I guess I have to go find amanda holliday. That makes literally no sense. She's the shipwright.  
---
It also appears I am not allowed to finish osiris. The campaign is just straight gone. If I want to finish I have to pick it up as a legacy quest and start over from the beginning. That's stupid as shit.  
---
Also, she only even offers me the red war, curse of osiris, and warmind. My destination map has a big ass shadowkeep icon on it, but nothing for Forsaken. I clicked into every single location mousing over all the quest icons until I found one that finally says Forsaken, but I don't even know if it's the right quest. I guess it must be as it's the only one I found. It's just infuriating.

Also are the year one weapon good even if they aren‚Äôt meta ? Like the origin story ,the nameless ,dare devil cuz i really like them

can i delete a character and redo that over and over?

Do it... Pussy üòÇ

No it doesn‚Äôt work like that. You can only have three characters to do it
