He's on the Mercury map, at the top. There is a separate icon for him.

If you haven't complete Curse of Osiris, it might not be available yet.

The people who think it's dead don't know its FTP. It's not that surprising how a polished game, with lots of free content and a high degree of publicity, could manage to draw in a sizable FTP demographic. It was only ever the price gouging that kept D2 from being more of a thing earlier. A little bit like how Battleborn and Paladins both tried to ride the Overwatch hero-shooter train, but since Paladins was FTP from the start it had no problem building a playerbase out of people who couldn't afford (or weren't yet sold on) Overwatch, while Battleborn tried to compete in the paid gaming marketplace with a similar level of (admittedly pretty decent) content and it flopped, mostly just because the demands of the audience are a lot higher when you expect them to buy in before they get to try the game out.
---
Does that mean i have to redo it cuz when i came back all my gear was 750 and sone new places unlocked for me and overriden my progress
---
As a crucible rookie with barely a 1.05 KD, I think of it as Shaxx attempting to fostera positive mentality in us and praising effort over results. Shaxx isn’t dad... Shaxx is coach. Shaxx believes in you, unlike dad...
---
It's a PC problem too
---
Not sure.
---
Nothing was overwritten, they just changed the baseline Power to 750 when Shadowkeep released.
---
All progress should've stayed the same. You might not have Mercury unlocked or something. But he is on the Mercury map. You can't miss him.
---
"I don't go past 6, you hear me?!"  
---
It pains, but no. Never. He's gone. Shiro for Hunter Vanguard.
---
I havee mercury unlocked amd the triumphs to prove it
---
Probably shouldn't have fooled around with the Drifters sister....
---
People have already said higher difficulties of the ordeal. Otherwise an exotic in the wild has a chance of dropping in lieu of your prime engram drops
---
I like how you're clearly just like. "Oh. Well, ok then. Guess I'll go this way."
---
Just thought of it.
---
Am sorry
---
If Titans eat crayons so do hunters
---
Dude that makes no sense Xur is not affected by the season
---
Pulled a sneaky on us
---
You wana get Ophadia Spathe on Guardian, twice the knifey fun
---
It’s the new Sidearm from SoD. Tangled Shore Beacon
---
Fellow guardian can you provide a source? Please and thanks
---
Looks like the connection got interrupted between the 2 teams. Screen didn't change for invader being o. Your side and the game didn't register any damage on the primevals on that end screen.
---
I have more armor 2.0 exotics in the vault than your total lol. How do you achieve such minimalism?
---
Forgive me, but who is Xur?
---
Maximise the discord window so its fullscreen. Might fix it.
---
That’s why I think momentum control is the most balanced pvp has ever been. Class ability advantages/disadvantages are negligible and opens the door to many other guns that aren’t in the current meta
---
Not calling you a liar, but I have literally not once ever heard someone say that. I thought Gandalf was a well done character arc.
---
No
---
It definitely did! thank you for your business, and anyone else who wants free caries i charge $300 for Lunas and then +$150 for Not Forgotten. DM if interested
---
"THIS IS AMAZING"
---
The trust hand cannon with explosive impact
---
But I really like the new lumina ornament should I use it for pvp?
---
Try going into the quests/pursuits tab, if it's not in there, then it's a bug.
---
Arbalest has 25 zoom. The lowest a SR can go is 35 afaik, which is on Twilight Oath. In return it has 70 (75 with mod, 23% more than Arbalest) aim assist to compensate and can roll with Snapshot Sights and Outlaw. Just go dump your extra junk to the vendors and you should get Enhanced Sniper Rifle Targeting mod sooner rather than later.
---
You have a point.
---
...or do you now?
---
That's actually one of my favorite lines ever, I giggle a little every time and always repeat it into the mic .
---
He'll always be Castle to me
---
My last game I played today felt like my first game. I can still here the sound of the Arbalest when I close my eyes. All 6 of them
---
It was data mined that saint would be a vendor in the hanger
---
Lol he’s literally a void titan why tf would he have a clang hammer
---
I’m both in the start I like to run up and just mess with the dudes capturing their first point after that I’ll be there for as many points as I can.
---
Sadly, no
---
I’m having the same problem.
---
Had to do a little bit of digging but here ya go https://www.light.gg/db/items/36120323/a-lost-relic/
---
&gt;...It's why in his lore stuff he tells us "If you ever meet a Cayde-7, he's not your friend."
---
I think I just realized how I *really* want Cayde to come back.
---
Still a good meme tho
---
Applies wall =D

Once you upgrade the obelisk (by depositing materials similar to turning materials to destination vendors) you have the option of taking bounties with random objectives to acquire a specific gun. I do not know if they rotate, but Tangled Shore's obelisk offers a bounty for Steelfeather and you can take multiple bounties to have several shots at acquiring the roll you want. Hope that helps.
---
Is Lumina "the best"?
---
Nope
---
Does Lumina offer a play experience not quite like anything else?
---
Yep
---
You need to progress the Nascent Dawn quest line. This is a known issue and i guess Bungo just doesnt want to fix it.
---
I know Nascent Dawn has nothing to do with it but  for some reason one of the steps blocks you from getting more stems. Either progress that or if you have any blue quests on the map that could be tied to ND finish those and you should be good to go.
---
Nope, gotta fly to wherever you want to get true bounties from either the tower or specific planets
---
Lumina just isn’t good
---
I don't know if I entirely agree. I agree a cayde 6, our buddy leader coming back would be awful. But I still contend a nightmare cayde created to torment us and twist the knife in by the Darkness. A cayde who would be taunting us  and making us laugh and cry at the same time tearing us apart would be great.
---
"Come on that was a horrible shot. Zavalas knitting club could do better than that! I thought I taught you better than that, no wonder you let me die."
---
Beyond that I would be all right if cayde came back in a more tangible way. But for something like that, it would have to have serious consequences. Uldrens death for example. It certainly couldn't just be the good old cayde we used to know.
---
But that is just my own opinion. Nightmare cayde should be a go, otherwise there should be seriously deep and intentional writing with good reason for cayde to return in any other form.
---
Ok
---
When I logged in today,  I was told that I could unlock EDZ and Nessus obelisks. However, Osiris doesn't have any missions for me to do it, so I don't know what to do now, to unlock them. If anyone knows how, please let me know, it will be much appreciated.
---
You don’t have that many kills and hunters are the most common class for crucible so everyone will most likely have more hunter kills than anything else
---
See it’s working!
---
Are you sure you have enough memory to install the game properly (installs tend to take up up to twice as much space as really needed). Also:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTechSupport/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTechSupport/)
---
Oof nightmare cayde would be terrifying... I love it
---
That looks just like my dog
---
Because saint can be whatever he wants to be!
---
They got rid of it before new light.
---
I have 200 available gb on my internal and 900 gb on my external (also didn’t know that subreddit existed thanks)
---
We also have interactive taunts and taunt-kills (aka finishers)
---
there's currently a bug that causes the game to forget your video settings once you close it. Wait till patch.
---
Ok tnx mate
---
I’ve never made it through in 12odd clears! Love my clan mates for carrying me 😂
---
...*im sorry!?!?*
---
hahah that’s my throwaway
---
Falcone PUUNNCHHHH
---
They could do alot for ships and sparrows by adding a few small things like this.
---
Yep, from Xur. That was the only exotic armour piece I was missing so I thought I’d give it a try. Worked out!
---
I have literally never used arbalest before this season ffs. It sat in my vault until the komodo quest. Keep spouting misinformation though, its fine.
---
Just do the leviathans breath quest... Wait
---
I love it
---
[fff-ptink]
---
Nice it’s laced cut right
---
Every time you rank up, you have a chance at them
---
Honor! Justice! REINHARDT REINHARDT RAINHAAAAAAAAaaaaa
---
epiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii*congratulationsitsthesamefuckingthingsomeoneelseposted*iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiccccccccccccccccc
---
Complete Nightfall: The Ordeal on Legend and above. There's no sure way to get exotics besides Xur and certain exotic quests (which Sunbracers aren't involved in iirc). Just kill mobs and hope to get lucky.
---
I don't eat crayons?
---
I know! I'm having the same issue and it pisses me off
---
Thank
---
Fair enough
---
Careful now hes a hero
---
Scouts and Pulse Rifles are good for PVP until you get some good purples and exotics. 
---
And anything you like for PVE really.
---
spicy, indeed
---
Honestly I didn’t start worrying about builds until I was done with everything. Leveling campaigns etc. But there are lots of youtubers who focus on builds. Cammycakes is a good one and so is mtashed
---
It's as new as the Annex. Meaning no, it's not.
---
I wouldnt doubt if new light players had higher drop chances up to a point. Ive been off and on in D2 and the amount of exotics I have would make it pretty unfair to new lights in pvp without some sort of catchup and then theyed get pissed and quit. That being said, its just my theory based on nothing other than it would make sense to keep potential customers interested.
---
Now you need just the mouse to complete the mission
---
Isnt eating crayons a titan thing?
---
Yes but titans disguised as hunters play middle tree arc
---
Is it? Im working on it now but Crimson with catalyst is still treating me real nice. Im glad it wont be just another collector exotic
---
Used to be able to get Sunbracers during the Red War campaign, but I dunno if that's still the case since New Light.
---
NGL that actually made me hate dregs wayyyy more than before, I actually used to think they were somewhat innocent
---
I love how builds in destiny always boil down to "choose this tree, use this class exotic, and now use this neutral perk" I miss the old perk trees in D1. (not saying that i haven't been playing with sunbracers top tree for the last week, but you get my point; what qualifies as a build in D2 is kinda sad, its nothing more than the combinations of more than 2-3 predetermined and invariable things
---
)
---
Nice.
---
It but possessive is "its."
---
Yes, it's the confusing exception to the 's possessive rule.
---
imagine being a boring fuck with no opinions
---
I never said bland games won but it is certainly mainstream. From softwares games are extremely popular. They seem to have a stigma of being very difficult and not inclusive but that couldn’t be farther from the truth
---
Didn't it used to show on the map of whatever planet where he was before? I swore it used to.
---
You just had a stroke, happens to my guardian all the time
---
I don’t think so, you still get all the cool seasonal loot.
---
What about "ini"
---
You forgot to add canada and poutines you monster!
---
Yeah, hey have great taste.
---
Wat mouse?
---
I feel like I'm about to get whooshed here...
---
Gravitation lance is probably my favorites energy pulse. For mom exotic maybe the cut and run for scout? Hits real hard. Feels good, both of them.
---
Come on bro lol as. Purple titan this offends me
---
This should not be considered a complement. Honestly.
---
Especially when there was a time where his icon showed up on the maps.
---
I also think some class specific quests would be cool. I main Hunter so it would be cool to play a mission design to play off a Hunter's strengths.
---
Shut
---
That's what I was saying
---
I eat glue and sniff crayons come at me bro
---
I really want some quest explaining some arcstrider lore and yes please
---
Steam input hasn't worked for me either. But DS4Windows works just fine.
---
It's not new but what is it's purpose? was this area tied to some exotic quest of some sort?
---
If it involves lore Bungie would be all over it.
---
Same here. Sigh. But that's why helmet is always on. Haha.
---
First time I ever did corrupted the other guys were speedrunning it so the whole time I was just dying to obstacles and "joining allies" and then suddenly it was over and I had no idea what just happened
---
we need a blue bow, a blue machine gun, and a blue/purple trace rifle
---
The starvation that the hammer and sickle bring?
---
I mean, I searched it 52 times last year lol
---
That’s totally ok, it’s not a reason to not have them in the game. You think it was easy to add playable elites? I’ve been involved in game development dude I’m well aware of the stuff takes time. That’s why I’m saying if they have the resources and the time to do it they should because it would in a sense revolutionize Destiny’s experience. As I said earlier stuff like this from a marketing perspective is a brilliant move I know because every game that has done something like this in terms of WoW, ME, Halo, PC:E, GoW, and even games like N.O.V.A 3 have been major success’s more so than usual because of the level of customization and diversity those games offer. The benefit of something like this far outweighs the amount of work required to put into it.
---
Bro....this is why shaxx keeps it on, he fucked himself up in the customization screen🤯🤯🤯
---
I was going to be mad at this, until I realized I just ran around Mars punching everything in site just to watch it go poof... have my upvote.
---
It very much does. I always use it with tether, especially in end game content.
---
Wierd thiss episode was on yesturday with his boss getting decapitated by the way hearing that handshake he got top sales for the third quarter in a row
---
I still get bulldozed and I’ve run it hundreds of times
---
Oh shit, i mamaged to read band wagon and bland wagon, my bad. Sekiro and all fromsoftware games arnt exactly mainstream, that wod be cod, battlefield, gta, red dead, ext
---
Its a shadowkeep exotic not a season of the undying exotic. Its a known bug that will be fixed. Theres just a lot of bugs right now
---
If titans evolved from the us marines then sure
---
Pure joy
---
Make sure to hit up xur for more
---
Crucible- Warlock. Top tree dawn blade is op. Ngl
---
I love it.
---
You could also 3peek with an emote.
---
Nice
---
Thanks!
---
It looked like The first burst was the one that killed and the other two bursts were after the fact but even if it were a two burst 19 a bullet in two 4 bullet bursts is only 152.
---
Does vsync hurt that bad? I don't notice any immediate difference turning it on or off.
---
Jingle bells, jingle bells...
---
Hence why I said there were network shenanigans at play and it didn't display the precision hits.
---
high isn't always a good idea, it can mean that background tasks that actually need to be done for the game can work end up getting lower priority
---
Thanks.
---
I wouldn’t go as far as that it is worse than handheld or shouldercharge. Since then handheld can be held forever and released when an enemy is close and the shouldercharge just requires you sprinting, which is something you nearly always do in crucible. And I feel like some Titans or Warlocks are just relying on those abilities and do not often try to pull off a good gunplay. That is how it feels to me at least, that some are doing it like it.
---
I agree on the big hitboxes though. I would not hate a slight nerf on that, because if i then pull off something like this one right here, it is even better :)
---
it's a joke. Why get so worked up?
---
I wanted this then saw it was of stock the next day
---
new player = blueberry
---
Still can't rap my head around that to this day.
---
The Handcannon? That is just Last Word with the ornament :)
---
The Dingening has begun.
---
There were no precision hits, I was actually the one on the receiving end, my head hadn't cleared the top of the doorway yet on my screen either so my head was not in line of sight on either screen.
---
The version for malph is completely different, there's a whole other pain in the ass part that you get to skip for the quest.
---
this is what i was looking for
---
Yeah, but they changed his engrams to have a new inventory, and if you have everything in there, your guaranteed a piece of exotic armor
---
Depends. I needed up 2-3h for the Linear Fusion Rifle kills, and 1,5-2h for the Survival rank. I would not say that it is long for ritual weapon
---
How exactly do you mean that? xD
---
*Do it. Do it. DO IT!*
---
Didn’t think they still did that
---
I was actually surprised how good it felt to use arbalest. Maybe I will use it from time to time in crucible :)
---
Those poor kinderguardians
---
[This](https://youtu.be/ks5lgcCFvvE) and bullet magnetism.
---
When a; I dare say;... *game* like ***Fortnite*** beats the likes of ***FFXIV*** and/or **Destiny 2**, that should tell you all you need to know about the current state of the video game industry. This is why MTXs (take note I said '*MTXs*', not '*monetizations*'. There's nothing wrong with some form of monetization) will **NEVER** go away and only get worse. SMDH.
---
Given how the Risen work, I can see arguments either way.  My stance is that he didn't remember his first time since becoming a Guardian, so speaking technically he was a virgin at that point.  Obviously he got some practice in between Crucible matches, or his "date" with Mara would have gone sour.
---
Yeah messed it up...
---
I’ve been using Iron Oxide. I really like it
---
Last season they were everywhere. Now they just randomly spawn, and in small numbers, in the monorail area and the area with the crashed Fallen ship. Hang around and you’ll see some. 
---
The Black Garden is considered the moon, or at least it was for the Vex Offensive - you could try starting the Garden of Salvation raid and killing in there, but I’m not sure that would work. Can’t hurt to try.
---
I would check those locations and see if they still show up.  (Obvious ones to test the hypothesis: at the top of the door into the Infinite Forest on Mercury, on the inside of the giant tree on Io, and facing east when you load in to Artifact's Edge on Nessus)
---
That little taunt he did at the end is so cute
---
Where are you based? I'm going their tomorrow myself. If they still have it, I can buy it for you and ship it your way?
---
oop am crayon eater thanks
---
They’ll win that award when Destiny 2: Season of the Seraphs drops in 2094
---
They came to ruin your heroic EP public event
---
Story wise, that's what you're doing. Gameplay wise, you'd immobilize yourself too much to do anything at all. Just picture it from a gameplay stance alone. But yeah if there was a exotic for example saying, titan stays inside duration increases by x and increases even more by x everytime a player gets a killing bow and x second steps right back into bubble. And stacks x amount. ( so it wont stay infinite)
---
Idk where you are getting that I am not calm. Was throwing in an opinion.
---
I don’t know what that is dude
---
The glow effect is cool but Jesus Christ is that armor ugly.
---
Your problem isn’t related to the quest. Just log off or restart, you’ll be fine.
---
Yea I know that its caused by the chest piece because the belt part comes from chest.
---
He’s on Nessus right now on the emperors golden ship
---
What platform?
---
Like is this even a meme? Where's the lie, man
---
Ey, maybe I storing a just in case orb of light there! You never know.
---
Luckily most of them are bad and can’t even hit the side of a barn
---
Nah im just assuming
---
&gt; warlocks snort that alkane dust for late night research 
---
Lies!  
---
I smoke finest baryon bough instead.
---
It’s been, like, 5 days. The season is months long. You’re gonna unlock boosts that let you get more, and you’re gonna play lots of activities that give you some. It’s fine.
---
The answer is a Jigglypuff seen from above.
---
Get it right, plebs.
---
What shader you got on that boi?
---
Everyone here just at the top of boot licking. They never should have won anything. Especially not this. There are so many better games that actually listen to the community and arent greedy as fuck.
---
I wanna be the very best!
---
Dingle all the way!!!
---
you only get armor after you have every weapon that can drop from engrams
---
Need to clarify a bit more. Searching for them on reddit, bungie app, console or steam?
---
I see, it looks great!
---
On Reddit.
---
Have you searched the error code
---
It'd be super nice to be able to recustomize our character without deleting them.
---
I'm having the same issue. It's really annoying because I'm finished with the quest otherwise.
---
This is against Geneva convention
---
If you cant find them directly through reddit just see if typing their user name on google followed with reddit, if that does the trick.
---
Psion blocks progress
---
So if your phone dies just put on a phone case and its repair it, very nice dude this is the best compersation a ever read.
---
Oh god dammit, I'd assumed it was per character, guess I'd better start those ones grinding too :(
---
K.   I will try that.    Thank you.
---
I actually hate you, they sold out so fast and i never saw a preorder available.
---
Seems to be a server side thing as few others ran across the issue as well on forsaken mission. Something went wrong during maint. So have to wait for bungie to fix it
---
Lol guilty of the first one but yes ran into a lot of arb weapon. But mainly for the shaxx ritual weapon.
---
Saint is most likely gonna become a vendor in the hangar before the end of the season.
---
Ah!
---
Good to know!
---
The entire forsaken campaign is broken right now, you’ll have to wait it out.
---
Code of the missile gang wya
---
Would be cool to watch but nuuuuuuu. Way to unbalanced.
---
I felt pretty useless in crucible when is started too. I kept playing though and started to understand when to use my abilities and stuff. For example, the dodge isn’t really a “dodge” that you can use to just not get hit, it’s more of a safety net you can set up by being next to cover when you start a gunfight and then quickly back away when you get low. As for guns, a good basic rule of thumb is to have one close/mid range (smg, shotgun, auto) and a mid/long range (sniper, fusion, pulse, scout). Like I said this is just stuff I picked up from playing a lot and got to around 3000 in comp.
---
\*Saint XIV inches\*
---
LMAO!! Good job; thank you for posting this. ♥
---
aesthetics
---
lol, I just went to Banshee's secret workshop
---
It was so satisfying learning to do the pre-charge.  Knowing a dude was there and hearing that charge and shot release as soon as his head appears in your sights.
---
Just use your LFR in heavy casually until an Arby drops for you. I wouldn't drive yourself insane this early
---
0-5500 all pinnacle weapons Dm me offers

Think I'm gonna go for dust rock blues that range is wild bit I'll keep those in mind brother

Time to farm some menargie then
---
NGL I tried this too for the first time the other day and had the same reaction. It made me really fuckin sad whenever I lost my hammer and had to wait for a new one
---
Working as intended?     
---
In all seriousness I don’t know sorry.
---
I got full bore slide shot and rampage on mine
---
So a hunter abused you in pvp so hard that you needed to come here and make a post about it?
---
What platform
---
Thank you very cool
---
Everytime I see this I just report them 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Yes because it's free to play now
---
I rock gambit leather on everything
---
Cool cool thx
---
No I mean keep on doing it.
---
Goddamn 50? I thought I was booking it at 30... you just spam gunsmith/moon bounties at the AoS?
---
Can’t wait for a go figure!
---
*tear down this wall!*!
---
"Hey there friendly guardian, do you have time to tall about our lord and savior oryx?"
---
 It Will Hurt them. So i hope They lower their price by 80%
---
Oh yes, forgot about that. Thank you.
---
I disagree. Considering this isn’t a MMO like WoW or ESO, I do t think it’s a matter of play style or anything like that considering that this game primarily functions like a FPS but with raids and a open world. I do think they should have their own kits and whatnot. The general play style though is basically just point and shoot and rotate, like any other FPS. In terms of movement and combat, that’s a weird point to bring up since that has nothing to do with actual character movement from a player perspective but it’s considerable I guess. Not entirely sure what you mean by that and also in terms Sid size you could just scale them down for players. In terms of hit box and stuff like that for competitive play they are the most balanced out of all the species... not to mention they are the first enemy you ever fought in Destiny as well so it’s kinda.... poetic...
---
but it is not 10$ in every country . an example in my country (turkey ) it is actually expensive so we should think about it before buying.
---
No. I switched when the game came out on PC. But I also ended up switching consoles because nobody I knew was going to play it. So if I end up replacing my xbone and don't transfer characters first, then I should be able to see it
---
How will it hurt them? You are a single person not buying their product. They won't drop their price because 1 guy doesn't see the value of the content they provide. You're just missing out on the extra content for the sake of $10.
---
I do agree that there is more important stuff that needs to be taken care of first and I know that. But if they have opportunity. What better way to make the game even better by adding more races to the game.
---
Nooo! Don’t put Bungus out of business they are so good I love them no!!!
---
It’s only $10.....it’s a free game.....
---
🤔🤔 lol how does it hurt them? People have bought the dlcs cross platforms as well as well as season pass. I think you not buying it has been covered by someone else already. Tbh post is pointless.
---
I've been having issues with getting sunbracers to proc with the new top tree dawnblade melee. It seems to work 60-75% of the time but I get a lot of instances where I'll get grave robber to proc but not sunbracers. Is anyone else having a similar problem?
---
You're funny.
---
Your submission has been removed. We do not allow indirect screen captures. Please take a screenshot and try again. 
---
If you're going to post gameplay video or screenshots, please make sure it is not from a phone or similar recording, and is a direct capture, thanks!
---
Huh... I thought that was fenchurch.
---
How do you do this?, I thought titan melee was just a arm charge
---
This. Just all this, especially the use what works for you, I tried bottom tree dawnblade recluse mountaintop but it's just not my thing, I was doing ok but when I switched to middle tree dawnblade (well of radiance) lumina, and Starfire protocol I started top scoring very quickly, people always underestimate the healing of well of radiance and run right in just for me to kill them in one melee, I've survived so many shoulder charges from Titans who thought the could out damage my healing. And I've always been a heal bot but everyone said lumina was useless in pvp and when I finally used it, kill after kill after kill.
---
Using what works for you makes everything so much better, it's more fun, and you'll eventually do better.
---
The vex offensive (Season if Undying) is completely unavailable now, unfortunately. But Saint - 14 and all those quests come with it, yes.
---

I applaud you and your wife, this is why our community is so awesome!

I started with New Light in early October and simce then bought Shadowkeep and Forsaken on Steam while on sale and more recently Season of Dawn.
---
As someone with some experience in other Live-Service games like Destiny 2 I will tell you this : This reward engrams are mostly inconsequential even for a newcomer. 
---
I have 350+ hrs in D2 already but I have not spend a dime on Eververse.
---
In the case of D2 I agree : Reward Engrams are not great but its something at least. I'm mostly indifferent towards them.
---
As for weapon ornaments : most ornaments for legendary weapons are similar to their vanilla counterparts. 
---
Ornaments for exotic weapons are better but its still not justifiable imo to buy them for Silver given how many exotics there are in the game and you are unlikely to use and exotic for an extended period of time.
---
Armor ornaments in my opinion are pretty bad.
---
I'm a hunter and there are only a few ornaments that i somewhat like (this is my opinion, so yours might be different). 
---
Tbh if Escalation Protocol Armor would drop with high stats I would only use that because I consider it to be far superior to any ornament set.
---
The only situation where armor ornaments are worth it is if you have different types of gear from different sets that don't fit together.
---
As for pricing : Items from Eververse are really expensive and simply not worth buying imo.
---
The season pass for 10€ is worth it however given that just the armor ornament and exotic weapon ornament would definetely be over 20€ if on Eververse. 
---
 
---
Given the sheer amount of ornaments there is really no reason to own them all (unless you are very invested in the game, are a collector and want to support the developers).
---
In my honest opinion one should not play to own all cosmetic rewards which you only equip one at a time and say its cool then forget about it, rather for the content like raids and dungeons.
---
The next two seasons have to be bought separately
---
Look up the error code
---
Can you link me to that? Super excited about this
---
are you really playing destiny if those canal drop pods dont kill you in every cabal mission you play
---
It has been there since the launch of forsaken as long as you complete the story line
---
No, it only works with *solar* grenades, the leftmost ones that look like miniature suns. The other two types of grenade have different names.
---
I run the same talents but I'm not seeing the same demolitions returns as that. So sunbracers still give you 30% grenade charge on melee hit? 
---
I 'main' disc no matter which class I'm playing so this might be my new flavour this season. (also because fire is the new void for the artifact mods)
---
he has "spicy ramen" as his user flair ffs
---
i did but it showed all PC no xbox
---
It's not unlimited grenade energy, it's free solar grenades for a short time. Solar grenades are the ones on the left out of the three types and look like a miniature sun.
---
What's that even mean?
---
This is just mountaintop with extra steps.
---
It was in the big essay thing he wrote pre-shadowkeep. I dont know where to find it now but you can google it im surem he talked about "bringing trials back to a warmer home". Or something along those lines. He pretty much confirmed it coming back but didnt give any sort of clue as to when
---
Lmao I can bring my light down to like 130
---
Maybe later with the obelisk
---
Ah, gotcha. I read that, then. I just didn’t think it’d be back anytime soon because of the way he talked about it in the essay and the streams leading up to shadowkeep
---
just tryin to connnect the dots..... how can u watch a video of me shooting warcliff at 3 guys and not getting a single kill in a comp match that stands at 2-2 and 0 lives each and come to that conclussion?
---
Hahaahahhaha. Hell yeah. I love seeing toxicity. Keep it up
---
Zavala is a Spanish name isn't it
---
This means your internet is too bad to handle the game
---
Yeah same. I think theyll bring itvnext season at the latest. Theyre making pretty rapid changes to pvp lately. And the community is hurting for it.
---
Wow that cape is lit!
---
You must complete that in the current season
---
Definitely not
---
Zoom in and look at the preview box.  Sorry if this has been posted.
---
still doesn’t make it impressive
---
Ma boi purechill!!
---
So I guess destiny 2 memes aren’t allowed on the official subreddit that makes no sense than.
---
Ok but, and have you considered this, yes
---
Ok but, and has this crossed your mind, yes
---
It's crazy
---
We are. Maybe we could make a sub/reddit for people like yourselves.
---
Damn u got me there
---
Yeah, if you're not immediately in there when the boss goes down...so if you're running back and jumping to get there quicker, then it'll instantly teleport you in when the time is up. If you're in the air it puts you right into the blades when it does that.
---
I don't have arbalest, I only joined the game recently, so I don't have many of the exotics most players have.
---
What app is that?
---
What abilities/gear do you use to get the knives to charge up so quickly?
---
No, if you use arbalest you're trying to grind out linear fusion rifle kills for the ritual weapon.
---
Quit being salty, it'll be over soon enough.
---
I'm in the United states kentucky to be more specific and man I'll pay for shipping the works !
---
This is pretty close to my code of the commander build last season, with oppressive darkness
---
I used: Doomfang pauldron, monte carlo, then the melee+grenade refractors and/or overload grenades.
---
Fully built for discipline.
---
It was just an endless cycle of voidsplosions and health regen, and indeed, near unending supers due to the shield toss being a "grenade" which allows you to spam it regardless of getting a kill during sentinel shield.
---
Looks like this season it'll be something like phoenix cradle+monte carlo+bottom tree solar titan+breach resonator and the solar grenade weaken effect.
---
You threw those at the shoulder and chest and they both hit headshot
---
Bye felishia
---
Throwing knives auto recharge on precision kill with that tree
---
Found a Palpatine clone.
---
Arite. I'll check tomorrow and if they have it I'll pick it up and we can talk shipping then. Just to make sure, it's the black ceramic one with like, a black lid. Kinda like a takeaway coffee lid almost? 
---
There were 2 there the last time I was there so hopefully they didnt sell them already
---
Glad to see Crayon Eaters is catching on
---
Nothing.
---
That's the thing, you really don't have to redo anything unless you want to. 
---
I run everything through with my hunter, but I'll log into my titan occasionally to mix things up. My warlock really has never gotten any play outside of the intro quest, but has decent enough gear it could play anything, if I liked the play style at all
---
How is it a fake ornament? I made them myself by hand?
---
Keep climbing 💪😁
---
for those who don't understand: he started throwing the hammer against the wall and I just added hammers into the loop. Afterwards, I was close enough to get my hammer back at the same time as him because the hammer has an really big pick up radius. You can also use this thing to create a hammer machine gun with one that loads and more than one guy shooting hammers around!
---
So how do these work? Is it a one shot kill anywhere? Or do you need to land a head shot for it to one shot kill?
---
Vu Vu Zeala
---
I’m a titan main, and I feel like I’m being attacked...check username
---
I have never heard "I'm a good guardian" and "I just run hand cannon and shotgun" in the same sentence unironically.
---
I'd call this "pain in the ~~ass~~ soulder"
---
Check light gg if you don’t believe me, it was in the “best of year 1” engram loot pool
---
Soon I’ll be trending, I now know why people are really gunning for my titan ass in pvp tho
---
F to all those fusion users while I'm here being a stupid and using triple shotgun
---
He is right, I got it
---
Oh fuck me I just found my new cloak!
---
Are they going to be ornaments?
---
Also it’s worth mentioning that it happened when I started playing as a Warlock after having my Hunter main achieve power level ~698 in the previous season.
---
Excuse my typo: Has anyone ever had*
---
Can you help me understand what is fake about it? It’s just like the pendants I’ve made.
---
This is so goddamn stupid and I love it
---
I’m pretty sure You actually have to reach mythic or legend. It’s a bug. I’ve seen it posted a few times.
---
If you know how to lead your target dodging only does so much they'll die the second their dodge ends.
---
quest from Osiris
---
NEVER ads with the rootin tootin, cowboy
---
What is it?
---
Still viable in crucible
---
Op are you a titan? You sound like a titan./s
---
What song is that?
---
I’m a hunter main, Titan is my least played class dawg
---
Oh I was being super super sarcastic
---
How you can throw knifes without any "reload"
---
Ladies and gentlemen......
---
We got ‘em......
---
Glad u witnessed it
---
Use Google
---
I haven’t had either in my inventory and it has been increasing anytime I do crucible, strikes, etc. just an FYI.
---
been around for a while
---
Stop b lining at me with a shotgun. I can see you on radar, I’m not following. You meta user
---
I was using Zenophage on some nightmare hunts. It was doing a good job.
---
My favorite flavor is Blue
---
If you’re dodging out in the open, that’s on you. Dodge into cover. There’s only a handful of spots on any map where you aren’t in range to dodge behind something. You will easily avoid so many deaths doing this. Than just wait around the corner (back up, obviously, so that a grenade or shoulder charge won’t kill you around it) and pick them off as they come around the corner. Try using rift or barricade in the middle of a fight. Youll die instantly unless the enemy is so incompetent they can’t kill a standing still, stunned target
---
Well I’m still gonna keep Symmetry equipped because man, the thing’s like a hybrid of Skyburner’s Oath and Polaris Lance, but Arc and a lot more fun to use.
---
Just pulled this bad boy back out and am loving it. It chews through ammo like a mfer but it's fun. About 80% to master working it.
---
Nice work!!
---
The class logos appear to be photoshopped.  If anybody else agrees, they can start spamming me upvotes right now...
---
(Wait for it...)
---
Aside from being a material otem you can redeem at banshee on occasion for upgrade modules i think you bring them to petra for a dreaming city engram
---
Are they popular in comp this season? On ps4 and PC so far this season and last Ive barely seen either of them in comp above like fabled 2
---
Me a casual not knowing what a pinical weapon is: time for another strike.
---
ah okay
---
Name her Tress Everis cause she will take all your money and time.
---
The floor is lava 🌋
---
Quickest way is to do bounties like on the moon and team up with someone. There are season pass perks on it that increases xp with other people in your team etc. Just read the bonuses below the season pass and then find someone who fit the description and just farm bounties on the moon. Each in separate lost sectors. Will boost up your ranking pretty fast.
---
Edit: was already mentioned.
---
You just never quit do you?
---
i feel bad for that lobby
---
Let me live. I just returned base game before it had the chance to be good game.
---
My Hunter buddy had this happening the other day. I'll send him a message to ask how he fixed it. Not sure when he'll reply, though...
---
It’s about stealth and mobility, the hunter gracefully leaps from building to building to take out the fallen uprising near the southeast wall while the titan can’t balance the weight of his armour and the warlock got his horns stuck in a tree.
---
Architects my ass
---
Oh
---
Use something fun like double shotgun and its going to be a breeze
---
Yh. But i fixed the problem^^ it was the steamoverlay (off)..
---
[deleted]
---
Year 1 Destiny 2 was very casual friendly and it was the worst year for Destiny. That's a hard no for me. I'm sorry you don't have the time to grind out the titles but I don't see how making them more attainable will help the game in any way. It's not like they keep you from accessing any of the content.
---
Regarding the Xbox Live community there isn't much Bungie can do about that. If you need help accessing content check the Destiny 2 companion app, there is an LFG tab(which should probably be in the game by now).
---
Man I am one of those warlocks who are too busy saving my hunter friends from trouble no matter what they say
---
That disc does nothing. You download the digital version of the game when you put it in.
---
That F though.

If the save file is originally for that steam account and not using cross-save Im pretty sure you cant move the saves over
---
Loaded question isn’t a linear fusion rifle
---
Your submission has been removed due to not being DESTINY RELATED. 
---
Please keep all submissions in English and related to Destiny 2. All D1 content including D1 nostalgia are welcome over at /r/DestinyTheGame, however this is the Destiny 2 subreddit where D1 content is not relevant.
---
Oof you mentioned OEM now Reddittors gonna dislike you
---
I just got cancer. I'm glad Hunters and Warlocks get the better abilities. OHK ranged grenades for Warlocks and OHK ranged knife throw with huge hit box for Hunters. Nice. Maybe now everyone can stop complaining about shoulder charging.
---
Probably had a friend that was a new lighter
---
I tried with both Titan and hunter. You can't re-run the quest.
---
This needs to become a in-game ghost shell
---
I’m assuming we can do the mission in the second timeline next week? Does anyone know for sure? I wanna save Saint already.
---
Yes there is a reason. Loaded question isn’t a linear fusion rifle.
---
You are correct young Sir, you won this quiz
---
We have Crayon Eaters and Alkaline Muchers. Where's my title so I can wear it proudly?
---
I don’t have these fortunately but this is exactly why destiny won the award for best community! It’s people like you guys that keep us going through the dark times like curse of Osiris 😂
---
Everyone wants the new pinnacle weapon. But, yes it’s annoying af. So, until it dies down a bit I’ll be playing mw and mhw
---
I felt embarrassed dying alot in front of Saint-14
---
Yes
---
Im gonna say it
---
Im gonna say it!
---
*za warudo*
---
Wait there’s an ornament for the shell?
---
That's... Definitely odd. Might be a bug and sometimes GLs are finicky like that but it should work :/
---
It's funny because you call someone who is addicted to nicotine a fiend
---
Wait I thought he came out on the 17th?
---
Have these people even heard of freelance? That's the only way to get better. FEEL THE BURN (of agony)
---
Congrats for being an asshole
---
You are oozing brilliance I hope you know that.
---
This warmed my heart.
---
One of these assholes actually DM'd me when I posted looking for a legit group two seasons ago.
---
I don't think he appreciated it when he got laughed at and told to find a real job.
---
If you didn't play much then just make a new account and character. All have been boosted to a certain level so you aren't lacking at all if you didn't had much progress. 
---
If you still want that there's a bnet account transfer to stream. Just look it up somewhere
---
Just wait until Momentum comes back. Jade Rabbit has been unthroned.
---
Please never let them quit that was brilliant.
---
Its like you have infinite melee abilities
---
Which can mean a variety of things
---
Infinite knives, hammers, shoulder charges, grenades via either voidwalker, basically it feels like you have a strenght stat of 1500
---
Man this sub has so much more positive energy than r/destinythegame I love it
---
Looks like Voltorb
---
*Sundance used Self-Destruct!*
---
They left because of Saint 14's return
---
Mithrax
---
The key mold has to be made first, it's another quest in your inventory from Ada that involves killing "Watchers" on leviathan first.  Then it becomes a quest getting resources out of chests. THEN you maximum temper the Bergusia forge
---
I also need to do it for the ritual weapon but I don't have it :( also trying to get randy's atm but every time i get into a fire fight I just get one tapped. Just sucks the fun out of crucible for me.
---
Kinda makes me not want to do *anything* on my Titan when A: I get that notification constantly, and B: there is nothing it needs to get done that my Hunter doesn't need, and my Hunter has no issues whatsoever. I quite literally can't figure out what the notification is for, and if I need to redo the 3 campaigns while listening to that chirping then I'd rather just banish my Titan into the shadow realm.
---
My Voidlock main is 100 discipline and, when the activity allows it, I’m running Nezarec’s and a Void energy AR (Reckless Oracle) with Demolitionist. 
---
Trust me: I ain’t forgetting no grenades :)
---
RIP S8 Oppressive Darkness.
---
Don’t do sunbreaker kids it’s highly addictive
---
“The guardians resort back to old era tech. We filled this chest piece with 100000 helium “birthday?” Balloons!”
---
I wonder if one of these coming seasons are going to focus on Uldren. I'm not sure the majority of guardians, or players, would be thrilled, but it could be interesting.
---
Big bada boom
---
Right maybe that's why! I'll give it a go, thank you very much.
---
If you bought shadowkeep you got the currently active season pass with it?
---
That's a fake account and not @Bungiehelp... If you look close enough
---
I'm naming my child that
---
Respect
---
I only died once, but I definitely used his bubble as protection to help keep from dying. Also only used Perfect Paradox so far out of respect!
---
Seems to have expired. Must have gotten on the tale end of a previous season. Feels like a ripoff now.
---
When they play sports they'll be able to hit the ball from a mile away
---
Sure thing, good luck out there guardian
---
Yeah, so I’m happy it’s coming back with the cold front.
---
The knife can track...?
---
I'd contact Bungie Support. I doubt they're going to be that stingy especially if you didn't even access any of the rewards.
---
Wait until Momentum Control comes around for the Scout kills. Sure you will still get one tapped, but the feelings will be mutual at least.
---
Doomritos?
---
You're a Titan, Harry
---
I tried using it to solo flawless shattered throne. Vorgeth still kicked my teeth in and gave me a swirly
---
Ye
---
Well that doesn’t sound rational ahah... I thought hunters are bragging about the _skill_ required to aim these...
---
Caxx
---
You mean to level artifacts right? Surely people weren't leveling to 1,000 for just that reason?
---
"people who don't agree with me are retards!!"
---
What shader are you using? I feel like I need this aesthetic on my builds!
---
When's the last time we were in a firefight that big? It was so much fun
---
Ding!
---
Chicken! Bring a fork
---
Parcel of stardust :)
---
If you hit a headshot it refreshes
---
Yes, and gathered watcher’s lenses and amethyst.
---
That’s what streamers do: make the mundane seem sensational. It’s hype. 
---
That’s what Titles do: get us to grind for bling. It’s hype. 
---
Feel free to ignore the hype if it’s bumming you out. Play for fun, later for the rest of it.
---
Looks really nice
---
Don't, Guardian!
---
Saint-14 was only impressed that despite insurmountable odds, you pressed on!  Seeing your fighting spirit is what inspired him to push further. Before that Saint-14 had given up hope that humanity could continue on, and your light has shown him the true strength of humanity, determination.
---
With Despair for dipping.
---
Its amazing now. Plus its f2p so you have nothing to lose but maybe 5 minutes of your time
---
Sometimes when I do this (usually in PvE) I feel like Oprah but instead of cars it's knives.
---
Bungie has pretty much ruined pvp to the point of it being unplayable but pve is a ton of fun and has tons of content to enjoy
---
We are a Xbox only clan
---
Also your friend barely scratched the surface with 100 hours gameplay
---
Fk... I did it solo without realising you could use his bubble. Took a long time.
---
wait, so youre telling me, instead of solo running that whole thing frantically dodging all taken and jumping back on the entry platform, i could get inside his bubble to reload?. :| new light didnt teach me any of this.
---
I think that is the only roll. I got the same thing.
---
xd
---
Equip peregrine greaves, that's it really.
---
What is the difference in content between shadow and forsaken?
---
I hate Oprah, and I love this post.
---
Bruh
---
Its still not quite perfect like it was with the elite controller though. I hold left-alt with my thumb to res, which let's me strafe with the WASDas while aiming and shooting, but I can't jump with spacebar at the same time. If I put any actions onto my mouse buttons, then I can't effectively aim while doing them. It gets pretty complicated. Might get a driving foot pedal :P
---
You’ve been hit by *Clap* *Clap* you’ve been shot by *Clap* *Clap* smooth hunter
---
Dont they weekly bounties reward u with a purification ritual?
---
Jeez is bullying titans and the "titans eat crayons" memes the only shit the whole community has?
---
Well funny enough 4 of the 5 guys in my party, I had literally just met the very day of recording this.
---
I was expecting “hello darkness my old friend” to play when the screen went black and white.
---
Also do other games connect fine?
---
upnp from bungie selfhelp: 
---
UPnP Settings
---
UPnP is a network technology that allows devices on a player's network to configure the settings on the router or modem to automatically allow the connections they need. UPnP is the simplest way to make sure a player can connect to Destiny.
---
When possible, Bungie recommends players use the UPnP setting.
---
Players should only use Port Forwarding when they cannot use UPnP and are having issues playing Destiny.
---
It is not recommended to enable both UPnP and Port Forwarding at the same time.
---
UPnP is REQUIRED if players plan to use more than one console to play Destiny on the same network simultaneously.
---
2. you also want to check xbox live or psnetwork to see if they have an outage (depending on which console you play on)
---
3. Also make sure your internet service provider isn't having a service interruption.
---
Wdym about "Are you expecting a titan to actually be smart?" And what makes the crayon eating thing sooooo funny. This is just getting stupid and boring.
---
Lol, at least this is wearable, I dont think I'll ever be able to make last years Bucket Hat Hunter work XD
---
Forsaken has you go too two mew location while shadowkeep has more lore based stuff, i would start on forsaken due to the low level and two fun location, you get a new raid and more weapons. You get more exotic quest and op exotics like one eye’d mask. Also forsaken gives three new super paths....but you get those off the bat
---
I have the og, not sure how the rolls go with purchasing from a vendor.
---
Your feedback has been passed along
---
“Decent Delay” 🤣🤣🤣
---
I got addicted pretty quick! Lots of fun
---
Smithsonian in Washington ?
---
That's cause Jesus Christ is ma nig***
---
I don’t know, sorry I guess. I just like the class I play being really memeable because of this stereotype. Didn’t know people disliked it this much. Sorry then
---
I found it really hard to hit those damn guns. Good job guardian!
---
shotguns are extremely easy to use if you have basic crucible skills
---
a shotgun scavenger or speed boosting exotic makes the braindead shotgunner play style easier
---
if you want an example try
---
“Transversive Steps + Shotgun Scavenger + Mediocre Shotgun”
---
What's that chestpiece and how do I get 20
---
There’s like a fixed thread with the best rolls for each gun. If you can’t find it there but you want to know if yours is any good you can post it asking for help. 
---
If you search using the name of the gun you will probably find several posts about it
---
Unlink the one you have linked then link both it should work then. Took me a little while to figure it out.
---
Rapid fire frame new sundial Auto Rifle ... it sooooo good
---
U/keenmetirl
---
Don’t know if this is good evidence for you but ps://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/691087-playstation-4/75897718 as for Xbox that’s my console and they take up the same space
---
Don't worry that's exactly what you should be doing outside of melee range. Bullets track better when you aim down sights. Even with perks hip-fire and free hand grip you still ads.
---
Dont mind the trolls. After massive exposure to salt levels on r/DestinyTheGame rivaling the oceans, most people lose the ability to be polite.
---
Lul imagine bragging about having a homing knife when I have homing fists XD
---
i haven’t downloaded a disc game in a while, was probably just remembering incorrectly
---
*eating crayons*
---
Talking a lot of shit for being in golden gun range
---
Okay, that shit is AIDS.
---
Yup, started having that issue after the last update too. 
---
It’s really annoying since I have a tendency to do other things when I’m going from activity to activity... or waiting forever to queue into a game of gambit or crucible.
---
Do not play crucible.
---
a lot of sidearms aren’t that great. I wouldn’t bother. This also is not the god roll.
---
If you enjoy using it just use it but don’t masterwork it.
---
Should have put hunters
---
well yes, but actually yes
---
The refreshing taste of a Pepsi
---
What emblem? I’m fabled too and I don’t have an emblem
---
It's always been there.
---
They make them scented for a reason
---
These accounts that post are dummy accounts anyways right? They would have to hire someone to actually go all the way till they are invited to the REAL team and then ban....which to be honest is not going to happen. Also I mean think about it the peeps paying money to get these weapons, think about how much they are spending in eververse. That should answer yr question as to why this is not being taken more seriously.
---
Ok so Titan have shoulder charge one hits, hunters have precision knives one hits. Is there anything for a warlock to one hits?
---
Only part 1 of it
---
You can unlock the obelisks, but you can't actually run the sundial without the pass
---
It part of the quest step. It’s similar to the final steps for the crucible and vanguard
---
*guest
---
There was plenty of ammo. Just pull out IB and profit.
---
Oh yeah my bad
---
Nice bot
---
It's....a little too easy to use right now.
---
I am an average PvP player, and even I was like, "are precision hits supposed to be this easy with this?" when I loaded up my Hunter and took it for a spin
---
Not Arbalest?
---
IB with it's special shot. Dies super quickly especially with the weapon of light buff. Then did the same thing to the walker.
---
You too?
---
It be like that sometimes
---
For that talon emblem?
---
