I remember doing my first leviathan Raid about 1 and a half months ago. It took long and wasn't really fun. But when we finally beat it, it felt so amazing.

I want voidfang vestments back, but with a different perk. I liked the perk it had, but I want to see something new
---
But I‚Äôve never seen it up bro, like I saw a gameplay video last week with a gun from the new update and I was on during that time and the mode wasn‚Äôt there
---
Thank you very much

Gameplay doesn't have to be recorded at the same time as it's posted. He may have held onto the footage. Or played in a custom. Supremacy WILL roll onto the screen eventually. Probably where Clash is.
---
Empyrean Dynasty was a step in the right direction. Granted it was paid unless you had a ton of bright dust and checked the shop every week last season, but the lion shoulder pads did not disappoint
---
Literally hover your cursor over the stats, god some people need everything explained to them in the slightest detail, whats the difference between STABILITY and HANDLING like bruh
---
How about bungie fix steam link support for the game, I dont know about you guys  but I wanna play D2 on my phone without Stadia lag

I have it and use it in crucible.

In corridors of time pt 1 he's freaking out because the fallen killed everyone (dont recall him saying anything about eating children) but he does proclaim the fallen were gonna wat his ghost
---
This is my daily/weekly ritual
---
 *  But 3 cores from the spider (cost in legendary shards 10, 20, 40 = 70 total.
---
 *  If I've got time, Pickup a spider bounty giving cores
---
 *  Head to gunsmith and grab any bounties giving cores
---
And complete at the same time (obviously grabbing any extra bounties for seasonal exp)
---
Between that and cores from scrapping weapons I've got a full master work armor set since starting half way through season 8.
---
Celestial Nighthawk/Whisper or Anarchy is goated

THIS IS AMAZING - Shaxx

Yep. Oh and he liked my reply linking my original Tweet.
---
This is an old meme
---
Did he retweet your original post or something?
---
Google
---
Google on steam
---
Where is this number coming from? Surely not all weapons in a weapon type have the same amount of reserves. Also, the trajectory is so different. I don‚Äôt understand what is your point. Maybe the grenade launcher does not require headshots but you need to evaluate trajectory, etc. It‚Äôs really really not the same, there are so many variables you did not take in account.
---
On steam
---
Google it 4head
---
He does mention it in that mission. I missed it the first time
---
Google wallpaper engine
---
It‚Äôs on steam
---
Goto steam and search name
---
I actually really liked this, good job
---
Shaxx got the mountain post quest nerf.
---
Me and a random also had the same thing happen to us yesterday
---
Doesnt need to be confirmed, it would make 0 sense for them to give you some increase in your chance for having more complete at once. If it was that way why would they hide that info?
---
Yep... done that more times than I care to admit
---
It's in Classic Mix
---
U have stupid
---
Yep
---
I'm not wasting 10 minutes of my life.
---
What about it?
---
Thanks!
---
I laugh when me and my clan mates are running qp just to have fun and people think that a 6 stack is automatically sweating their dick off. Like bro, we are just in a party chat halfway not even trying and next thing you know we get bagged after every death lol
---
no it‚Äôs not, there are specific exotic quests that give weapons 5 light above yours, like does anyone know what i‚Äôm talking about?
---
Who‚Äôs Gladd?
---
It‚Äôs under Classic Mix. It‚Äôs not a rotator.
---
I'm sure he and The Colonel thwarted many a Red Legion invader together.
---
We salute you, Guardian Companion - I'm certain you brought much Light into the world.

My heart goes out to you. Just know that there are too many bones to chew and an unlimited supply of fresh tennis balls where he/she is now.. üò¢‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Ah, i didn‚Äôt catch that part. Thanks, Gaurdian
---
I usually run Ace of Spades, Recluse, Hammerhead. Will swap out Recluse for Claws of the Wolf or some scout rifle depending on map like most people suggest here. Better Devils do well in close/medium combat so just play with the map or play according to how you position yourself
---
Liars handshake and riskrunner on arc singe make a really fun loadout
---
Damn

You make me feel like a OP God since I did both. Made me want to die occasionally tho.

I‚Äôm talking about the taken version of the fallen-esqe armor from PoE, or however you get it.

Did cayde died in the infinite forest? No, then we can not bring him back.
---
along with all the other campaigns if you haven‚Äôt completed Osiris or Warmind üëçüèªüëçüèª
---
Is there any way we can download this and use it for montages?
---
Nice one, you should go for the lairs next!
---
Needs more jpeg
---
Damn, of course its from eververse
---
Not finals, but a 10-6:30 job and two kids...can't get shit done
---
Better than creating a thread.
---
I only started the grind when Momentum Control was introduced and it took me 4 days to get mountaintop with orewings maul and the colony. I feel dirty
---
*blinks a single time*
---
He/She clutches perfectly. Appears around that corner like a champ and in the heat of the moment waiting to get the shield back up could have proven to be fatal for it gave time to three people to coordinate and back away from the entry spot in defence, as opposed to one attacker calculating three separate attacks. The advantage of distance trumps the True Sight in this particular scenario. You know, if you like to dissect a split second decision in order to undermine someone and that sort of thing :)
---
You know; I think that Hunter managed pretty well, all things considered.
---
'but its shit because its stadia' really sums up how dumb you guys look, arguing about a service that runs perfectly fine.
---
I need to test that I'll give it a try now
---
Lairs?
---
Popular destiny youtuber/streamer. Does a lot of solo challenges and stuff. Just really good at the game
---
LFRs are so fetch...
---
What it say?
---
I honestly don‚Äôt understand **HOW** Hydras can stomp.....
---
The other leviathan raids that aren't crown. So eater and spire, they're basically just mini raids so to speak
---
Are. You. Insane.
---
This is some next level destiny trash

were can I vote? As a warlock main does my vote count?

This speed run has lots of dynamics to it and I‚Äôm sure there is a lot of room for improvement. This is the new era of Destiny speed running.
---
I just think of them as unleashing such a massive fart that it causes an energy force field thing lol
---
Good post bro you gain subscribur
---
or couldve just ran away seeing there was 1 door he couldve gone though. or not waste a super. seeing unless he gets the sneak on them aint no spectral gonna live though that.
---
I laughed hard when my hope will never die came on
---
Powerfuls now can slowly take you to 960, then pinnacles will slowly inch you up to 970
---
Quite a bit since each raid has different mechanics obviously, but the main thubg is that they're pretty short, especially eater (literally just a jumping puzzle and then two phases of a boss and done). Still gonna have to listen to calus blabbering on about whatever mind you
---
I use 10
---
It's a standard one two punch. Overflow is nice. I need to test it with Wormgod to see it's true potential though.
---
Gotta work on that sparrow corner
---
That actually sounds good! My older brother was complaining about getting burned out after the raid and wanted to wait a couple weeks before doing another. Seems like that would be a good down time activity!
---
*Immune*
---
Gotta love those immune phases
---
The Light will burn away both the Darkness and my eyes.

You didn't create this post. It's a [repost](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/e7ztja/the_helmet_stayed_on/).
---
They said in the twab that of you can put 2 of the same mod on an item it will work but give diminishing returns. So 2 mods doesn't mean 2x of the perk but more like 1.5.
---
I use it to even out my gear. So if all of my pieces are higher but my arms are lagging behind you can pull them out from the rewards and even out your gear
---
Why did you respond to them with thanks? It's not like you did the art.
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one

Bold of you to assume I even know what that boss looks like when I can just nuke it the moment it comes out and get my chest in five seconds flat
---
That‚Äôs funny I had a guy tell me that I should delete the game immediately and save everyone else the headache of having to play with me on their fireteam... yes, we were on the same fireteam. (I didn‚Äôt mention of course that my armor ornament is a garbage can... still...)
---
No, no, no my guy, you‚Äôre reading way too far into, no one runs this kind of math in their head especially when theyre playing casual, popping your super at low health is basically asking for suicide and he was even running worm husk which means he had a faster heal time than normal, he knew he got shot with arbalest which means he knew he‚Äôd take more damage which already isn‚Äôt a good thing at low health, he also decided to go for the farthest guy who wasn‚Äôt even looking at him instead the closest one who was also the biggest threat, you say it‚Äôs fatal to let that have time to coordinate while healing but in reality all they are gonna do was have one person watch the door while the other two fight else where because it‚Äôs only one low health person, not like they were gonna set up a god tier defense or anything, you can tell he wasn‚Äôt thinking strategically at all during this because his first instinct was to make a meme out of the whole thing, sure he probably wasn‚Äôt sweating but don‚Äôt say he managed well when anyone would be mad if a hunter pulled a stupid stunt like this while on their team
---
Well, especially if you add weapons of light...
---
I‚Äôm on ps4 also

I'm sorry but why the FRICK do you have that many tokens!

All that for a drop of blood.

I bet Bungie regrets bringing the gun back lol

This post was made by D1 Vets gang.

I mean, there are still some sweet looking armor sets now. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yeah, I miss him. Saint is pretty cool tho.
---
Not my art, his name is in the title. I just added some animations.
---
I mean how would the even nerf it lol the whole point of giving hunters weighted knife was so they can one shot people considering they never had one
---
IMO, it‚Äôs just a more (potentially) intense/competitive version. One round, and you can steal motes just by having two blockers up at once. In recent experience, most of the hyper sweatsicles don‚Äôt really play anymore, so it‚Äôs not too bad to get into as well, especially if you have a coordinated team that knows the maps. There are more yellow/orange bars, FYI
---
I have. I used to play everyday for hours. Now I haven‚Äôt played in like 2 months. I got tired of doing the same boring things to get xp. I got tired of the game not giving me credit for doing the mote thief triumph. My clan also started ignoring me for literally no reason and I just got disheartened and stopped playing.
---
Yea, I agree with what you said. It makes sense but it should be in collections.
---
Same person I ran into 48hrs ago, whole Fireteam popped super on him and he wouldn't die, health get to 10% then instantly full health again.
---
they are made out of whatever bullets they put in monty's revolver
---
For anyone wondering, it can now generate infinite ammo
---
Aaaah shit. Now I will need to restart playing it
---
Yea, it does work like that. It‚Äôs great but if you‚Äôre at a point where you need pinnacle...it‚Äôs not that useful to my knowledge ya know?
---
Double shotgun, brave
---
But i thought since oem was nerfed crucible was fun again i mean wasnt crucible only fucked up because of oem because you know.... titan bad while hunters and warlocks are all completely fair and balanced while... titan bad
---
Why are you even saying nerf rn.
---
Oh my b. I beat it back in the day so I hadn‚Äôt noticed haha.
---
It is to an extent. But yeah I get what you mean
---
While I don‚Äôt think you can get the actual object back the text is lore saved in the triumphs section.
---
Seems like he died to me so idk about clutching perfectly boss
---
Extra emphasis on steal
---
Yeah. I mean, I totally get it, but you‚Äôve gotta expect that once some people figure out the best possible way to grind a Crucible weapon, everyone is gonna catch on and use the same thing. 
---
I honestly feel like the ones REALLY complaining either aren‚Äôt going for the Komodo-4FR or just don‚Äôt have the Arbalest. üòÇ
---
Offer stands! :)
---
Good thing i dont main pc for destiny lol
---
Yippee Kaey-Yay MF
---
Older content has garbage dialogue, but the more recent content has gotten better
---
This guy is such a great artist! I recommend his Saint-14 portrait to anyone interested. I think you could find him on Instagram just by searching his name.
---
Gotta get them mats.
---
I've had a few as well. I'm no god in pvp but I'm always so proud when I pop off with an off-meta weapon like this
---
Holy shit I never really thought how our supers would look without our helmets. I can imagine some really powerful guardians are capable of doing some DBZ type shit, but we're limited by the game engine so we've only seen so much. If anyone's into the lore, in the lore book the chronicon there's a part where they essentially imagine how a fight between our guardian and Ikora would go down and it's some real DBZ type fighting it's crazy. I'm sure it's embellished a bit, but even then if you were to tone it down a bit it's still pretty insane.
---
Is there a particular reason?  I mean Cayde is largely thought to have had the best writing and depth.  
---
And how do you hate the colonel?
---
Are you people just gonna keep mooching off this guys art
---
I'm just happy hunters have an ability that can one shot now tbh. Warlocks had grenades, y'all melee, hunters... Died.
---
DID HE!?
---
This is incredible to watch tbh
---
Sidearms are meta! Lol
---
What are the rolls on your guns?
---
*exhales through the nose* have your upvote, dammit
---
Well... huh... watch again?
---
**I KNOW RIGHT!!**
---
Is there any better way to get a rare bounty, other than turning daily bounties and hope you get it? I‚Äôve turned in like almost 30 dailies since I got to that step in the quest, and still no rare bounty
---
Lmao "depth" that's why right there. He isn't funny u less you're 12 years old or have the equivalent humor of said age group. He has the most writing, not the best writing. Bungie just never cared to give us an actual compelling story, and we kind of get one with forsaken, but that's immediately taken away by how much it was overhyped, and the community was just so over the top about him, and still is. The only thing he's got going for him was the Nathan fillian playing him.
---
Urgh that sucks, thanks
---
And the amount of downvotes should tell you, you can't even express an opinion about him.
---
f
---
&gt;it‚Äôs risky but it‚Äôs worth a shot
---
That‚Äôs the thing, it isn‚Äôt. This wasnt the victory deciding play, he didn‚Äôt need those kills to secure the win, a failed play is a failed play, it‚Äôs not like there was nothing else he could do and it was the only choice he had, that‚Äôs why people are saying it‚Äôs a bad idea, not because he failed but because there‚Äôs was a myriad of things he could‚Äôve done and he chose this and the fact that you try to see the good side in something that wasn‚Äôt necessary and only relied on the fact that the enemy would think he was smart instead of pulling something like this is why so much people disagree with you
---
He probably using recluse with mountaintop
---
on console hunters just need to jump once and shotgun you in the face, their maneuverability is still unmatched imo
---
I second this, as soon as I saw these posts my immediate reaction was ‚Äúman I wish these were on wallpaper engine so I could have these animated backgrounds on my desktop‚Äù. Please make this happen!
---
That was awesome!
---
I do agree that American educational system needs improvement. We all know the problems with college being expensive but in terms of education itself, college is not the problem. The problem starts at middle school and high school. It is way too easy and not challenging enough for students that once they get to college, they get frustrated and are overall unprepared.
---
A degree is just a piece of paper but you are really under valuing what that can do. I am in the IT field and I can tell you that in majority of places, hiring managers throw away your resume if you don‚Äôt have a 4 year degree. It is a field where you can get education from certificates and have 20 years experience and a company still won‚Äôt look at your resume without a degree. American educational system has problems but that doesn‚Äôt mean all degrees are useless. The US bureau has some statistics on income rate that measures the value of education if you are interested.

"stop getting so defensive over what the downvote button means."
---
Well, since you said to, I think I'll get more defensive. The downvote button was intended to allow people to show you they disagree/dislike/whatever with what was stated in your comment, for example: "I think I know better than everyone else because I do" most people would downvote that, some may upvote but that's very unlikely
---
Hunters swarm grenade is a one-hit to at least it is to me most of the time.
---
You can invite people into your group to help you
---
I dig it. well done.    
---
Maybe have Cayde pull the football out from Zevala next
---
No, it doesn‚Äôt save your progress and you will lose it. It sets you with your fireteam and there is no matchmaking on the quest.
---
Usually it‚Äôs the total price before shipping and taxes.
---
Yes
---
You'll need to restart the strike if you quit.
---
Arms dealer is a strike, that mean that you can bring up to 2 other people. But because you're doing a "special strike" there's no matchmaking, so you'll have to invite people.
---
So he is to us what brother vance is to osiris?
---
He would always keep me company whenever I felt lonely at night and he would always love a nice belly rub. Sadly I wasn‚Äôt able to see him before he had to be put down because of work but I know he‚Äôs in a better place with all the toys and bones he could imagine
---
I know sometimes joining a game in progress can give you no bounty progression. Try logging out and back in as well.
---
Even warlocks do this once in a while
---
I just started playing destiny 2. This guy is a hunter? His ult or whatever looks way different than mine?
---
titan big brain
---
I think he means the ritual weapons
---
Its items from the season pass vs drop items. Same name different item codes. Thus this behaviour.
---
and nice belly rubs
---
Some people don't even leave purposely, some people lag out from trying to play on bad connections
---
Okay, so if I leave now and invite people, I can do it with them? That's good. I'm gonna keep trying a little longer though. I'm on 1 hour and 53 minutes rn, I wanna finish this shit and feel accomplished üòÇ
---
There is. 
---
Just download the video and use an app called intoLive. (AppStore)
---
Yay and where did you get that helmet
---
As a titan, I feel it is my duty to always charge through Fallen mines, walk in the radiolarian puddles, and most importantly, punch every cursed thrall.
---
It‚Äôs not an easy life, but at the end of the day, someone‚Äôs gotta eat these crayons.
---
Right and it isn't hard to tell between the two, one has to be done manually so it would just take a conditional gate.
---
Astrocyte is a random exotic drop
---
I do feel like they could at least increase a tad.
---
just got it in crucible ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I prefer minimum distance
---
Not always, the last two I had empty spots for the rest of the game. 2 slots and 3 on the last. Length depends on game mode and less people means it goes slower, usually til the clock runs out. That makes it worse sticking around to have to wait for time and have a disadvantage.
---
Destiny is weird like that. On one hand you get dialogue like the first Saint-14 quest, making you sob like a little bitch the entire encounter. On the other hand...
---
Year 1 strikes.
---
"In its dying breath, the Traveler created the Ghosts...To seek out those who can wield its Light as a weapon. Guardians, to protect us, and do what the Traveler itself no longer can."
---
‚Äî The Speaker
---
This is why you were able to become a guardian in the first place, and why your ghost can respawn you a bunch of times in order to defeat them.  You are it‚Äôs preferred method of killing and self preservation.  If it won all its battles for itself then we‚Äôd all be endlessly wandering around the tower hoping Fenchurch returns soon, or at least sends some news.
---
Use a finisher on them, you'll thank me later
---
Oh good to know. I Had noticed first with two bonds, one from Y2 and another one from Y3, same name etc other than this little details...
---
Oh from where
---
I don't play comp so i wouldn't know but i get destroyed by creative competitive builds in casual games there might be a grind for slot of them floating sniper is one of them it is quite a high skill floor to start preforming well
---
This is perfect for steams new game art. I‚Äôll use this as the game cover.
---
Maybe? I wouldn‚Äôt put it past my mind.
---
I just got one and have been meaning to try it out. Anything special about it?
---
Oooh I like the grey, ty for the enlightenment.  I haven‚Äôt been able to delve into the lore a whole ton, but I do go out of my way to look some of it up for more in depth knowledge when it tickles me.  I just started playing at the release of Shadowkeep and have only replayed the Red War campaign so far.  Had to get those ritual weapons and Undying title, now I fear the same for the new season, but I‚Äôll get there with the lore, it‚Äôs too good to just let go by :)
---
Other than opening shot, I guess I prefer its looks to being closer to reality than sci-fi
---
Everyone here is discussing what is or isn't p2w and I am just sitting here dumbfounded at how you are already rank 92+ on season pass wtf lol
---
I usually try to aim them at other enemies, sort of like xtreme football lol
---
they both just buff jumps üò≠ i don‚Äôt use blink
---
It's saved my life quite a few times, both with thralls and shanks
---
The Duke MK.44 is my favorite HC in the game, it‚Äôs slow but it hits like a truck and is so satisfying go play. It also can roll pretty decent perks, you want one that increases reload like rapid hit or outlaw plus a dmg increase perk like rampage or kill clip.
---
What in the fuck
---
This has been happening to me, I just surmised that because I had max glimmer, I got nothing from the chests.
---
Service revolver, austringer, lunas, not forgotten.
---
Srry found one already
---
Then that's that. Hidden Stats static too?
---
Huh what wdym you can get different rolls on exotic weapons?? I‚Äôm confused lmao
---
I never played before the hand cannons were nerfed(I'm a new light), but I'd really hate to see how hand cannons were before their range nerf because I'd hate to get 3 tapped across the map
---
Nah gonna edit that out lol
---
So these are more hand cannons that I missed out. Imma add that in. 
---
What‚Äôs the best one in your opinion?
---
And track and pierce through the shields some of themHave
---
It's work now. Just fyi
---
Luna or not forgotten ate hands down the best two in the game but hard to get
---
If ghallarhorn returns i Will shoot my own feet whit it
---
On exotic weapons yes
---
BTW yes Sturm and Drang are a great combo. Drang is my favorite sidearm and it's cheese at close range. Eriana is...underwhelming.
---
the fusion rifles are broken
---
IDK then, Personal Bias maybe, but Ace of Spades &gt; Thorn &gt; Spare Rations. Kindled Orchid never tried in PvP, and don't like in PvE much.
---
Hey, at least the meta requires skill now
---
I was unaware the HUD could be toggled. Good to know!
---
Just do one pick one and then another side on dif character if it's an option.
---
Bruh, thats why pc is better Kappa
---
I can hear the Transformers transition musical sting.
---
I'm not a fan of kindled either and I ran ace up until the hand cannon nerf. Now I run exclusively revoker, luna, until I get Not Forgotten. Thorn is still pretty good as well.
---
Same, I had max glimmer, but no local resources, and I didn't get any of both. It usually displays a message if the glimmer is too full
---
Can I play the sun dial without the season pass? I just want to get the Steelfeather repeater rifle
---
My game is basically running the same on all graphics settings right now.
---
Stop playing the only semi-fun part while waiting for new content to come out? Ur funny
---
Same issue here. You‚Äôre not alone lol
---
What's your hardware?
---
Three in a row for me yesterday, still exited each time the engram dropped. Also disappointed each time.
---
Question, is it possible to acquire to bow apart from the quest? Ie exotic engrams or from xur?
---
My pal keeps getting armor exotics and complains like bruh üòë
---
Seems a bit greedy.
---
Well I don‚Äôt have randys as I‚Äôm not a competitive player :-S
---
It's pretty much unplayable for me right now. I know it isn't my hardware because D2 is the only game I'm having problems with. Hopefully Bungie figures something out considering Dawning drops today.
---
Slowpoke jokes aside... I wouldn't want some evil paracausal ancient alien thingie to exist in the universe. I'm comfy in ours, thanks!
---
This joke was Tarrabah-le.
---
was so hyped to get an exotic from a strike chest ... otherside sparrow. who remembers the otherside
---
Same.
---
It‚Äôs really wild to me that people don‚Äôt play the raids.
---
Ummmmmm....ur good man. I'm at a 1.75 ka/d but numbers r just numbers man. U do u
---
~~ok~~
---
The one on her knees is already being assimilated
---
I gotta add that realistically only Forsaken is actually good, and the Red War is somewhat passable.  Shadowkeep is meh and short but lets you unlock stuff.
---
You're kidding me! That's my hometown, tho I live elsewhere now...
---
Well, they may be a bit boring, but Nezerac's combined with bottom tree devour and a demolitionist weapon is insane. In any area with reds, you're literally grenading once every few seconds. Which then feed backs as well, causing your super to recharge in a minute, literally, due to the abyssal extractors feature.
---
So there are often synergies with even these boring ones that make them very much not boring. 
---
I do love the arc turret with Getaway, it's really helpful in basically every activity.
---
Which is that spawn animation?
---
You‚Äôve got an arm blade at least
---
Perhaos you can shine some light on why people want it back then.
---
Because from all i read about its yet another competative pvp gamemode with a pass that gets used up if you lose to many matches.
---
What is the reason people want it?
---
Your 5 below sells destiny??  Dang
---
Most likely the current besto glitch.
---
Well in all seriousness, I refuse to use a sparrow that doesn't have the instant rez. The wait is interminable, push, hold.... hold... hold.... hold.... I'll go grab a coffee... hold.... hold...
---
This is awesome, I wish I could make it my moving wallpaper.
---
Console or pc. They very depending
---
Right? I hate this selfish stupid argument that they should be able to stomp less skilled players rather than actually compete against similarly skilled players. If Bungie wants to throw the PVP elite a bone give them a leaderboard system with unique cosmetic rewards. But don't shit on the newbies so you can feel good.

Ignore the hate. There‚Äôs plenty of idiots out there but I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs many many more kind guardians out there.
---
But only in *one eye* kek
---
Maybe just a smidge :)

Oooo I‚Äôve been meaning to try that actually, sounds noice af

Thats called an axe...
---
Cayde is better than saint and im a titan/hunter
---
I‚Äôd say feeding frenzy instead of outlaw and range mw or reload speed and a differnt mag/ammo perk
---
You ever get this to work?
---
A quick check on the stats or perks it came with... Ah worthless YA YEET
---
Thnx bro
---
Or maybe nicknames that get shown as the weapon used to kill in Crucible. So that in armor slots they still have their usual name, but when you get killed you see the nickname you gave the weapon.
---
Hmm is there a difference in chances for getting Misfit? If not then I might go with Regular just for the smaller enemy health bars with a few Prime thrown in for the bounties. I just felt like I was getting more done in it (primarily the number of matches). But if you recommend Regular then I‚Äôll try doing it primarily for a bit and seeing how efficient it is unless there‚Äôs a difference in Misfit‚Äôs drop but I‚Äôm gonna guess that‚Äôs probably gonna be random.
---
Yeah would be pretty cool
---
You can dip your toes into destiny with the free to play version. You'll get access to everything made from Year 1. If you feel like you want to pay, you can pay.
---
Np, so much stuff has changed and Bungie doesn't exactly explain any of it.
---
It's nothing.
---
I once had a game of rumble with only bots other than me.
---
Was the last time you played BEFORE October 1St?  If so that would explain what happened.  Everything swapped over to new light so all weapons and gear got bumped up to base 750 and I guess the old quests you had changed out.  But like a previous comment said go to Amanda Holiday in the tower.  She has the campaigns for Red War, Curse of Osiris and Warmind.  Forsaken you just start from the Tangled Shore Map.
---
but caydes dead, just like my belief in Santa
---
Absolutely gets better after year 1 stuff.
---
If you aren't having fun don't force yourself. Personally I'm  having a great time with it and compared to its launch, its in a great state right now.
---
Can see it now, everyone in Crucible killed by 'MuH dIcK'
---
Wendigo is great, I don't think it's the best but definitely up there if you don't want to grind rng weapons. But in order for it to do top tier damage you have to get charge of light.
---
Actually funny one my friend was in the gam u deid and the try to do this
---
Slow down there pal! So at the moment the base game is free. Then the added dlc/seasons all tag onto the base game. As you have had it for 4 months you may have paid for the now free part. If you are trying to get back into it then I would play with your friend. Tag along with them and assist. Get them to tell you about the current meta weapons and the story. I‚Äôm doing the same thing with a friend but with the halo collection. At the end though d1 and d2 are different games. You may not like d2 at all.
---
thanks
---
Regular gambit is much worse
---
Isn't this Brian Moncus' art?
---
No actually, I‚Äôll try them. Thanks if this works, because then I‚Äôd be able to get sleeper
---
Misfit is a world drop - so the chances are the same. 
---
https://www.light.gg/db/items/819441402/misfit/
---
I'd grind out the kills in regular and then switch to Prime for the matches as they are faster.
---
Shot down with The Wet Fart
---
Arghhh shit here we go again
---
Alrighty then. Thanks a bunch. I‚Äôll do that then.
---
I like the emotes. It's when someone bags on me that I pull leviathan out and ensure I drop a Zeus flex and a tombstone on their corpse every. Single. Time. And I make a point to kill them. If they have no motes I'll camp the same dude for all the kills if his team respawns him, and I'll drop a flex and tombstone every single time. I imagine it pisses them off really bad because I'm pretty decent at PvP, and they always try to run rather than engage with me lol
---
How old are you?
---
Thank u, I'll try it and get back to u :)
---
The throwing knife archs down you have to aim above the head even at that close range
---
There should be a ‚ÄúWe Ran Out of Ammo‚Äù medal.
---
Punishment for using meta
---
Unless you have a good invader or are all around better than the other team it will snowball even harder than normal gambit. It's good for quick matches but more team focused.

First time? I have a negative k/d but I'm always against sweats

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna collect more Morphine you broken piece of AI SHIT‚Äù

Honestly, warframe could have been one of my favorites but the constant back and forth hoping you have the right materials but realizing you need 30 more of something that‚Äôs almost impossible to find. 
---
And for what? Some bitch that wanted to be named after a flower? Or the AI that changes personality (failsafe does it better) and is broken as fuck?

I got mine with speed demon so I'm not upset

Watch them slip it in tomorrow without announcing or buildup.
---
You can get Whisper yes. 
---
Ritual/Pinnacle Weapons can be finished regardless of season.

No wonder hunters are so toxic when it comes to discussing titans ^^^/s

I'm working on this too, but my "Enemies" number is stuck at zero. Anyone seen that before? Am I doing something wrong?

---
For the Season of the Forge, Drifter, and Opulence, their exotic gear and quest are still available.  
---
But for the Season of the Undying, any exotics that require the season pass, such as Leviathan's Breath and Eriana's Vow, to acquire is gone. Xenophage and Death Bringer are still obtainable as their are tied with Shadowkeep, not the season pass
---
It does, Sunbraces just appears to have an internal cooldown. (15 or so seconds)
---
You‚Äôre so lucky. A lot of people are running around with multiple buffs going at once and no drops at all. My brother and I have both been having this issue for a couple of weeks.
---
Yep make you think doesn't it titans are the true gunslingers lol
---
Has gun in one hand ... shoots you with fingers
---
I hear you. Can't blame them though. Pvp community is hungry for a new activity that would make pvp rewarding again. I‚Äôd rather have them hyped than quitting the game. Hope Bungie won't disappoint us next season. I think they realize it themselves after the outcry at this season‚Äôs start.
---
The perks are but not the mag and barrel
---
MTashed, iFrostbolt, Houndish, and Esoterickk (if you like to see high tier solo runs)
---

---
I've been on the receiving end of that "oh come on what the fuck" play often enough that I half expected you to pull it off... until I remembered what the title was. ;)
---
"My name is Odysseus... and everybody in this room tried to fuck my wife." \[Cue action music\]
---
Yeah I am in the same situation. I wish Bungie at least locked this quest rather than letting me go through 4 steps and then THIS.
---
I tried to punch it but nothing happend
---
im getting tired of people reposting this dudes art. people were getting thousands of upvotes of art that wasnt theirs. those upvotes belong to brian, not to the reposters

"Villain" in that she stole tech from a lab that damaged her body in order to correct her body. Her total potential kill count by the end of film would've been a single Schrodigner's box.

I have no such hat. I feel frankly aggravated with all of this. Everything you said seem very specific. Do you have a friend in mind? Because it has nothing to do with the situation.

Waiting for full health to go out there would have given them time as well, allowing them more margin for action, which is something you can‚Äôt control and can result into a better or worse outcome. Better or worse. 
---
Suggesting it‚Äôs a bad play because he did not wait IS narrow minded. Jesus fuck it all happened in the span of 2-3 seconds and all of you would have done SOOO MUCH BETTER!

Easy talk but bullshit still.

It was not a bad play :)

I had actually thought of a warlock exotic when they announced changes to top tree solar. that is a lot like the hunter one but it made more sense imo. While in air if you Icarus dodge it drops a grenade directly bellow, and gives you a slight shield while dodging, the perk is called Fortress in the Sky.
---
I feel like Devrim will be like "I'll put the kettle on and we'll work on it together"
---
The bow is awesome, there's better choices for dps but it's a oneshot in gambit and it feels amazing to use. It's funny but right now the Queens exotic bow is the best bow in game due to a bug with its damage.
---
Dude devrim would let u copy.
---
I actually had to hold in a massive laugh while in the middle of class from watching this.
---
Fuckin dregs.

[In case anyone was looking for proof, yeah.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqI4PumNVC0) LFRs are unbelievably bad, even after the buff.

If I survive a 1v3 twice with the same group I start questioning the usefulness of my team.

Spoilerrrr

If you find them, share them!

But my point is that you *should* be ashamed. Why would you deliberately rip off someone else?
---
Draw time on that bow makes it almost unusable for me as a primary. I have an Arsenic Bite in my energy slot with a masterwork for draw time, with Rampage and Explosive head (archer's tempo would be better). 540 draw time.
---
he only thing i think needs to be nerfed is the auto refill on kill. I think that should have been tied to an exotic. Here me out.
---
The titan gets a kill with shoulder charge it had to regenerate unless paired with skullfort.
---
Create an exotic that makes that next knife automatic on kill.
---
When the hunters jump on the displays
---
Poor Banshee DX
---
Huge oof
---
It has very little recoil, spawns what is basically a swarm grenade on headshot kill, and has outlaw. I like it for PvP pulse rifle kills.
---
Hey my man, if you need help, I can run through with you. I was stuck for a while myself because I didn't have people that felt like running it. I was able to mostly solo the dungeon including the quest parts, outside of the Vorgeth boss one, so as long as you're not completely horrible then we shouldn't have a problem.
---
PS4 screen name is the same as it is here, "Inkoms". Shoot me a message and if we're on at the same time we'll get at it.

Also, like others said, LFG discord and stuff like that could get you a group of people needing it as well.
---
Blasphemy!
---
I trust that it‚Äôs no longer there?  Better not be, Guardian.
---
Just last night I did a 1v2 (last guardian standing) while they were both charging at me at the same time, did the sickest play to outplay them. Won the match. Felt soo good! It was my first time doing that
---
Absolutely! And same to you, guardian. ;)

It's a real great pulse rifle, If you land all the rounds it's good in pvp, and the nanites make it easy to get multi kills if two guys are in close proximity, the only drawback is it has a high burst count and it kicks a bit. there are other more stable pulse rifles out there with slightly better TTK. (especially when certain perks are active like killclip)

---
You need a rare bounty. A lot of people have better luck holding on to 10-15 bounties and turning them all in at once. I myself had no luck turning them in after completion but when I held onto them and did a lot at once I got the rare bounty first try. Good luck guardian.
---
Was funny did laugh
---
They are literally almost the same
---
There is a _ton_ of content that comes with the free version. As for getting started and leveling:
---
-	start with the campaign
---
-	once you get to the ‚Äòtower,‚Äô pick up bounties for all activities you enjoy
---
-	work bounties into your play sessions, they‚Äôre great sources of XP
---
-	Look at activities in the director (Crucible, strikes, specific missions, etc) and their rewards at the bottom of the card; ‚ÄúPowerful Gear‚Äù offers good LL boosts, ‚ÄúPinnacle Gear‚Äù offers the best
---
-	if you get higher LL gear but don‚Äôt like it, either infuse it into stuff you use *or keep it on you*.  RNG and leveling now takes into account your max possible LL based on all gear you‚Äôre carrying
---
-	Infusion now requires an Upgrade Module, Banshee sells them
---
-	Uh, mild spoiler I guess: Banshee is still alive üòÑ
---

The Arms Dealer strike was a year one strike before Forsaken came out. U had to run through it to get Legend of Acrius back in the day. It‚Äôs not a Season 8 strike so it should be available to everyone.

I love it when you're punching something, and a cursed fallen gets in melee range, and the game autocorrects your target to the cursed fallen. I've swung 180 to punch one of these things while swinging at another target. It's Destiny's version of typing ducking to autocorrect fucking.
---
[Oh Really?](https://i.imgur.com/2PUQg2W.jpg)
---
Do you have to do the strike?
---
Apparently it was an unintended feature according to the hotfix Bungie deployed just now. Oof

Not having the dlc on a different platform still allows you to use every gear you got. You just cant access concent that require said dlc.

Yeah or have a toggle to auto breakdown into gunsmith materials

Go elf yourself.

Is it?  I legitimately didn‚Äôt know.  I assumed Bungie didn‚Äôt care given how prevalent it is on the lfg app. Not to mention all the farming service ads that come up on every site that mentions destiny.

Yes. I am her little lamb. lol

I don't have any problems with guardians going grey or even turning to the dark for power.

It's when they go against humanity that I have a problem.

And since a lot of humanity has thrown its lot with the light....

Well, let's just say that people saying "fight the light" is usually a cue for me to pull out my arc-staff.

Keep an eye on the spreadsheet linked by the OP.  The community will fill it in as discoveries are made.

Can‚Äôt get reported. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm actually doing anything wrong. Basically doing the same thing a ‚Äúnew player‚Äù could possibly do. Also if the team is 0-3 it‚Äôs already gimped.
---
It‚Äôs like being dropped in a 2v3 game. My partner can treat it as a 1vs3 with 0 lives beacuse I‚Äôm going to end that entire match ASAP and move on to the next match.
---
Casual players don‚Äôt have the time to spend on a 4-3 comeback match.
---
Our battle will be legendary
---
Ok, just looked it up, they changed it with shadowkeep. Every 4th completion of 2 guarantees and every 2nd completion for 3 guarantees a gun. My bad
---
I get it almost every time from T2 o it because I‚Äôm after spare rations. I‚Äôm sure that would be all I get if I was after the pulse though lmfao
---
Tier 3 is better for farming guns
---
I hope not.  
---
Our entire guild will move to another game over that...
---
Perhaps you would be happy to find the objective without a marker then?
---
A little ironic that hunters are supposed to be independent, but they‚Äôre also Bungie‚Äôs frontman for mass appeal
---
One of the things that's always troubled me about the evaluation of skill in Destiny is the fact that it tends to value kills so heavily.  That seems to be why Bungie has attached Glory to a kill-or-be-killed format devoid of other objectives, but I think it offers a pretty poor picture of a player's actual skill. 
---
Bungie seems to realize this to some extent, because they now have to incentivize people to play Clash with bounties; otherwise they'll just go to other modes where the killing is far easier.  I've seen plenty of people hiding outside control zones, for example, picking off Guardians who are capping, and they generally come away with K:D ratios of 2.5+.  Those tactics work less well in Clash and poorly in Comp, which probably adds to their saltiness, but they make the player look great on paper.
---
Oh thank you for enlightening me, I didn't know that
---
Idt 5% is gonna do much
---
Just buy 1k silver and buy it with that, whats the issue?
---
Should I switch to Golden gun for thematic reasons?
---
Well yeah, since that‚Äôs basically what I did.
---
Well I mean. It's possible you'll never ever get any from crucible. Statistically improbably but not impossible.
---
Got mine in 2 tries and master worked it that day. Fantastic gun. 
---
&gt;I owe my Outlaw, Killclip, smallbore, stability masterwork to it! only took 5 of the bounties!.
---
Yeah, especially since guardians are incapable of aging so they are generally stuck at the age that they are resurrected at.
---
Did you...? Yeah, you did do the homework
---
AND HALF OF WHAT IM HEARING IS HOW YOU AND YOUR CLAN ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE
---
They should make an edgelord subclass for yall bad bois

---
THANK YOU.
---
I got this gun when it first came out and have rarely used it since until this quest came around. Shit, what have I been missing? Its hilarious fun. I got 28 kills with it in a game of Control on Pacifica. Was even head shotting slide shotgunners. The crit hitbox must be massive! I'm keeping this in my toolbox from now on.

I got Komodo. Doesn't seem any different to any of the other heavy linears, tbh.

True, but there's been a bit of a backswing recently. 
---
Jedi Fallen order did incredibly well with no MTX at all.  
---
Monster hunter World, has a cash shop, but it's distinct from the game, concisely laid out and ethically presented with clear pricing and storefront integration.  
---
FFXIV has a cash shop, but again, it's distinct from the game, none of it's contents are ever required, and again - prices are all clearly conveyed and integrated.  
---
The total War franchise has giant piles of DLC, but again- it's ethically packaged, presented, and priced.  
---
  
---
There are plenty of ways of handling digital distribution responsibly, treating your customers fairly, and still making ridiculous amounts of money.  It's disappointing that bungie persists in engaging via bullshit fomo and dark patterns.
---
We have carried out an in-depth analysis of the reported comment but have found it is suitably rated.
---
Thank you for your diligent service.
---
yay now Symmetry is budget Randy‚Äôs...
---
Does that thing buck like a mule?
---
Everyone is acting like it hasnt been this strong since it dropped lol
---
It has ranked and casual pvp. The main sandbox mode is just going to planets and completing activities there.
---
Pinch of light plus vex milk = fractal rolls
---
Happy cake day
---
Those are the old ones, but still appreciated in case any new players haven‚Äôt seen em.
---
The sparrow is not a arbalest
---
Here I was hoping he'd be the new voice for Ghost. He'd be a bit less annoying then.
---
Thousand layers (riven cookies) - taken butter + delicious explosion
---
Can we just move past this? People are using it for a quest. Deal.
---
Exactly I honestly just never used it that much maybe once or twice
---
The way I look at it, you can‚Äôt always be passive in engagements. There will always be a time where you need to be a bit more aggressive, but I can understand where you‚Äôre coming from. ‚ÄúPushing‚Äù can also mean re-zoning yourself so your opponent has a larger disadvantage based on where your teammates are as well. 
---
It all depends on perspective and understanding that ‚Äúpushing‚Äù is a vital roll to PvP play in Comp / 6v6 (at least imo).
---
This exact same post was made literally 5 hours before you posted this
---
Nice, thanks!
---
Towels good cloaks bad
---
Is this one of the new dawning emotes?!
---
well pushing doesnt necessarily mean running full forward with a shotgun, it usually means applying pressure on the other team and pushing them more into their spawn
---
Definitely an original concept, very creative. Last Season was full of Scouts and nobody complained, but a sniper with a charge time is OP when it's also an Exotic, even though any sniper can outperform them?
---
That was still pretty insane. Lol
---
Which gun is it?
---
It does it's dreadful
---
Somebody tell me why I read this in the ‚Äúlook at all those chickens‚Äù voice
---
I agree
---
Cabal oil + multifaceted flavours = hackberry tart
---
You make a helmet oh wait
---
From anywhere?  Don't need to be on a specific planet?
---
Anywhere I believe yes
---
And sadly they do that because it works.
---
The perfect meme does exist
---
This guy in Crucible would be a nightmare.
---
Vex milk plus personal touch = Saint 14 cookie
---
Awesome, thanks guardian :)
---
In general it's just a fun weapon. Of course a sniper is more effective, but I still prefer Arbalest, no one expects it.
---
"No one expect the Arbalest inquisition."
---
Me: Can i copy your homework?
---
Shaxx: WHY CANT MORE PEOPLE BE LIKE YOU!!!!!
---
Do the menagerie quest first
---
Thank youu! Thats 3/7 in just a few minutes
---
GONNA HANG OUT WITH YOUR CLAN TODAY?
---
I‚Äôm actually not a kid rofl. Also I said I do this when the game is 0-3. Why would I do it if I lose a round or two lol. 
---
Everyone plays this game to win lol. What‚Äôs so hard to understand the benefits of time management.
---
What scout?
---
Is this possibly the ‚ÄúOk boomer‚Äù response for destiny?
---
YOU CANT HANDLE THE POWER OF THE DARK SIDE!!!
---
oh wait wrong universe...
---
Tangled shore drops a bow quite frequently just do the PE and LS
---
They seem like they're trying to get better though. I noticed that they're starting to try and inform players what is only going to be available for silver. They've also moved away from being able to basically just outright by bright dust.
---
Of course this is just my opinion, who knows they could be the worst offenders
---
If they were to have everything on the storefront from the beginning of the season until the end, and got rid of silver as a currency, the overall experience with the store would be a lot better for everyone.
---
From what I understood, usually it is more experienced players pre-Shadowkeep who use text chat since they know how to enable it.
---
Turns out I was right you are salty lol
---
Arbalast sparrow?
---
Not to date
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
taken butter+delicious explosion=riven cookies
---
They are unrelated.
---
Turns out I was right, you are salty haha
---
seriously FUUUUUUCK Spare Rations and Mindbender‚Äôs, that shit is so tiresome to fight against.
---
just let me be happy with my shitty Black Scorpion :c
---
They went down?
---
 I got feeding frenzy kill clip on my first one too
---
but stompees just make jump gooder, we want jump more
---
Since you believe you need a shotgun to push, I can see yo it issue... pushing mean moving forward for advantageous positions and angles.  If you get a kill, move up.  Keep up pressure. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve lost elimination games because teammates sit back of their thumbs.  I‚Äôll score a kill with a sniper and move into position and my teammates are still at spawn.  You need to push up to their orb.  Cover it.  Get angles so you can team shot and rotate.  If you hang back and wait for the other team, you‚Äôre asking to lose
---
Thanks
---
I‚Äôve been sitting on both for a week. Might finally get them this week.
---
doesnt everyone get this in the beginning? It was my first reward too
---
Well they said there will be maintenance for it and I'm just wondering cause I saw people post things about the dawning and for me it just says the servers are unreachable
---
Rose, and better devils, after all these years, is still meta
---
If you do the quest by osiris where it tells you to go find 6 things etc you will get to a part where you get to meet saint 14 for the first time. It's a pretty good quest, but padded.
---
I can understand you...But every dawning item besides the finisher will become available for bright dust still to expensive
---
Thank you very much!
---
Naaa from what I‚Äôve seen everything is online rn
---
Yes, but why could i do the other nightfall this morning and now it's gone? Does that change weekly aswell?
---
Seems to be a trend here with multiple player not being able to interact with it. Few in a clan I know have it as well :(
---
No idea on that one. To be honest I really don't pay attention to anything but the power level. 
---
Quite possibly gimping myself a bit but trying to keep everything else straight makes my head hurt.
---
That's cuz she baa-aaa-aaad
---
Impatient people I guess. That and some people have way too much time on their hands.
---
From your post;
---
"The Leviathan's Breath exotic quest if players didn't own the Season Pass. This will be available to players who own a Season Pass either now or in the future."
---
Nice, I'm glad you had fun
---
Incredible

A hole's a hole!!!! ü§îüòâü§†üòéü§ô

What  I hate is when I am doing a forge and we are on the boss. I go down and teammates stops DPS to res me. Everytime I want to yell at them "NO! Just DPs the damn boss! Your 3-4 secs is better spent doing that than ressing me. Rarely am I doing enough damage to feel like taking the time to res me is worth it. And it is always someone who stops rather than resses while still firing. I don't mind that, just please don't stop shooting.
---
Yikes i'm so sorry
---
Flys through walls with shield, instakilling bosses and foes alike  
---
ye, telesto and clash are a match made in heaven
---
avalanche
---
We ask for blink because we had it originally and people really enjoyed it in d1, all classes should have ohkos, I‚Äôve never seen anything about people wanting trenchcoats or grenade charging
---
Oh damn, that sucks
---
You just got served
---
It is season of Yeet after all
---
Where is Xur to give his, have a bounty for it that expires in 24 hours, surely they wouldn‚Äôt give that if he‚Äôs not around ?
---
If she tossed my Salas and I kept my hips gyrating, who do you think I would end up calling?
---
Cowabunga it is!!
---
Eyes up Guardian!
---
**I N D E E D**
---
No because a red glow pops up when going over an enemy and why do you want this ‚Äúadvantage‚Äù anyway
---
Fair enough :)
---
I'll try and see if I can get a drop or two of it and have a looksee at the stats. Thanks for the headsup.
---
Same here buddy saaaaammmmeere
---
Pretty sure he's either time locked or there's a glitch.
---
Why would I not be surprised if they make her the better vendor without telling anyone
---
Now you can pay an extra 5 dollars to suffer
