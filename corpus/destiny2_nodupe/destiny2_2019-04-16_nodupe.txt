After you've earned it once, Redrix's Broadsword can drop with different mag and barrel perks from any activity that drops other crucible gear.

Every pinnacle weapon quest that is not an achievement can be done once per character.

Ah I see. Thanks

It's absurd, I've reset my gambit rank once by **only** playing prime and completing bounties. Haven't found anything else other than the pulse rifle, the scout rifle, nade launcher and the sniper.

ooF

I believe it is 7.

If your reading this bungie. This is mostly your fault for leaving the casual pvp player without a level playing field. Is it so hard to understand that  valor rank shows only participation not skill. A player can have a 1000valor from only loosing without a single win. While glory is an exact performance point system. Only a winning player with a 1/2 win/loss ratio has a chance though a rough grind. Throw us low glory rank in with those who completed the fabled rank and u have effectively a child fighting a man. Then ull have bungie try to make a bullshit team: 2x A rank. 4x E rank. Against team of 4x B rank . 2x c rank . to have the A rank players getting dragged down by the others while the low rank still get pawned. Im no server designer but i certainly played enough pvp.online games to know they cam do better. Look at cod . fortnight and apex legends. The load screen shows the team total ranking. Shame on u bungie. Get to work before all the casual players give up. A simple suggestion would be to create.a quickplay lobbie for those who have a high glory rank

I used Duty Bound to grind Breakneck. Finally got it just to find that Duty Bound is like 100 times better.

Do you like getting to killed by someone with a mouse and keyboard? I didn't think so.
---
Probably won't be using it in Quickplay while I slog away at Mountaintop lol. I am excited for it tho.
---
I really should sit down and look at the lore one day. Warlock is my main and I love it, I have to really think hard to make myself play hunter or titan.
---
I'm the guy that turns auto aim off in all games.

As someone who plays on pc I‚Äôm fine with it; I could see why you wouldn‚Äôt but that doesn‚Äôt mean excluded almost a third of the games population from cross play

If you want a good mark too try the crucible marks, they might help.
---
That's what I was concerned about, going back down to heroic 3. I gave up on Fabled last season, but I kept at it this time. The Last Word is my best friend currently.
---
10/10 -- would put croutons on it!
---
But how do people have Crusebreaker than if no one knows how to get that last egg? I‚Äôm confused lol
---
*laughs in Last Array*
---
Yes its possible  takes  time  and  patience
---
Ah that‚Äôs right, I remember reading that in TWAB now that you mentioned it.
---
Wasn‚Äôt it originally a 2% drop or something like that? I‚Äôve done so many ascendant challenges and heroic missions since forsaken dropped and never had either of those drop before.
---
Photoshop you using them to infuse weapons into an Edge Transit.
---
Cool thanks!
---
As someone that uses chaos reach often, I finally got my geomags last night while playing gambit and I'm so excited.
---
Shaxx decided to be nice today.
---
You're fine with it because you are on the same playing field as your fellow players. We, your console counterparts (or peasants as your take to calling us) see not. The game would have to completely reconstructed to cater to you the PC crowd just so we can all play together. And you know what that means? Less money spent on development for new content and the game would probably be left in an even more broken state because now we have to compete with mice and keyboards. No one would be on the same level. So you, a PC player, should understand this better than anyone. The game shouldn't have to completely rebalanced to cater to that third of the player base. It's easier to exclude it and maintain game balance. You wanna play with your console friends? Better buy a console to play with them. I'd sooner quit Destiny than to see it completely rebalanced to cater to the crowd that has the clear advantage. For the last time, Bad. Idea. Moving on.
---
I need a Lego Warlock with the Great Hunt Set and 1K. Only then can I say that I got 1K on my Warlock.
---
It seems like you're confusing corporate hardball with competition. 
---
Competition works because customers have a choice and will leave you if you're not serving their interests. What Sony is doing is digging moats to protect their dominant position, it has nothing to do with providing a better product to win over customers, it is the opposite. They know that if cross save is enabled, the net migration direction is from console to PC.

You just need to get over the fact that you are entitled to every weapon in the game. Once you realize that it will all be fine.
---
Why? (Just wondering, not questioning what you said or anything)
---
Good one, i'll do that with short quests
---
Take advantage of your class perks. The best way to git gud is to tune each weapon you use to abuse your perks the most.

Bye, kid.

Modified Nighfalls and Raids. As a solo player afraid of LFG that's a line drawn in the sand. I even soloed Throne instead of finding a group.
---
Yes, but even if he can speak, all he will say is ‚ÄúOOF!‚Äù.
---
They fear that once you migrate, all subsequent revenue from future content no longer flows through Sony.
---
We liked it so it had to be removed.

I just prefer the way that they look.

That sounds like a bug.

Now you're saying it isn't an excuse, after you have clarified and edited. Yes. But you keep going back to your same point of "back then". Back then doesn't matter NOW. I know what you are trying to say, but it just isn't relevant. And by saying "Microsoft did X back then", you are making an excuse for Sony to do wrong now. You are justifying the shitty behaviour but are preaching that it's wrong. By saying this isn't an excuse, it doesn't mean what you're saying isn't actually an excuse, when you proceed to make an excuse. The excuse being "Microsoft did this and it was ok, now Sony is doing it and it's not ok". You're using a previously accepted wrong to justify a currently unaccepted wrong, yet it's the same thing, even if that's not your intent. It's like saying in 1940 "It's ok to be racist to black people", we can agree now it's wrong, but back then it's ok. Now imagine racism today? Let's say a black person is being racist to a white person, are we going to say that's ok now because white on black racism used to be accepted? No. Same premise. I get your overall point and I agree, but the way you're delivering it is suggesting otherwise, that's all I'm trying to say here really.
---
Agreed, it‚Äôs a nice and rare treat to have a civil discussion with someone online without someone resorting to personal attacks. I don‚Äôt think Sony is necessarily anti-consumer, I think they are just being petty, as much as I hate Fortnite I can‚Äôt deny it‚Äôs helped with a push for cross platform play. Hopefully Sony will get over this little spat and allow cross platform soon
---
I guess I can't really complain about the new content since it was included with the pass I already had, but I really wish there was more story type stuff -- I'd pay for another yearly pass if it meant some rich new planets and detailed environments to run through while your ghost babbles on.
---
Okay, that is hard to help with though because of how matchmaking is currently in comp,with the most sought after being in competitive. I fond it would be irrational to take people trying to hit fabled into a lobby of 5500. Any ideas how to remedy?
---
Im really happy with all the Edge Transits because its a good gun and I want to find a godroll for it.

I played through Halo 3: ODST yesterday and the whole time I just kept thinking how weird it was to hear Cayde when Buck spoke. I miss both Cayde and Buck.
---
sorce
---
Yep. That's the end goal. 
---
Thanks for the discussion!
---
I started watching players much better than me. It doesn't always come down to aim. People like TrueVangard and nKuch control and utilize their vertical space by jumping near a door frame, and landing shots on the way down. You know exactly where they are going to be, but they have to look to find you. After watching people play, I incorporated into my own gameplay. 
---
I've come to like how CoolGuy plays now with LeMonarch but with a shotgun. Got me to 2100 easy. And I do recommend a team; one that doesn't get salty as that will tilt everyone, resulting in a fruitless night of comp.
---
Probably not. He's so darn good. I've been replaying the entire Halo series in preparation for MCC PC and he was in most of it. Halos 1 through 3, Reach, and ODST, obviously because of Buck. Marines and the best darn ODST. Nobody else can do Cayde like Nathan Fillion.
---
Since you said you play rs and if you like FPS games I would say go ahead. Destiny 3 is rumored to be launching next year though so keep that in mind. If you do decide to buy the game, sometimes there are small discounts on the Base + DLC copy of the game.  If you enjoy it then you can go for the Annual Pass. I'm assuming the 100‚Ç¨ price you mentioned is the Base game + DLC + Annual Pass.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Compared to RS the game isn't as grindy in terms of hours played but you have to focus on the game since you have to aim. Unless you are an ehp person on rs then I guess it doesn't matter.
---
I quit osrs because I spent too much time on it and now I spend too much time on D2 lmao. Lmk if you have any more questions.
---
Yeah, with Forsaken and the annual pass, the first two DLCs can be skipped. Definitely worth it if you have the money.
---
What's the meme?
---
I got it no problem just solo queuing, and all I used the entire time was a Bygones and Loaded Question. It‚Äôs possible, you just have to keep practicing and get better
---
Except that not everyone likes playing with others.
---
I don't because you never know how they're gonna be and D1 showed me that most raid/pvp groups will straight suck. Get kicked for doing poorly in one game.
---
Destiny is a shit community and I won't unless it's for something simple like the Nightfall.
---
Soooooon grouping isn't the issue. üëç

They increased the timer from 30 to 40 seconds between invasions, and the timer starts upon invader death or invader return rather than immediately upon invasion.

True enough, I've tried doing it on my own but I always end up falling to my death because I don't shoot the diamond thingys quickly enough
---
It‚Äôs funny bcuz I actually have a deck of destiny 2 forsaken cards, they were giving them away at this game stop at bay brook mall (it‚Äôs in Texas, and yea) I was there waiting in line for Black Friday and then some employee comes out and starts asking people questions about destiny 2, like ‚Äúwhat character do you main?‚Äù Or ‚Äúis one eyed mask over powered?‚Äù Or ‚Äúshould they nerf telesto and blade barrage?‚Äù And just stuff like that or things about destiny 2 in general, so yea and me and my brother answered some questions and we both got forsaken playing cards, they‚Äôre pretty cool !
---
Fair point, although I tried last time it was. People just hate Mercury
---
I got mine without pre-ordering the game bcuz my game stop was giving them out bcuz apparently ‚Äúno one pre ordered destiny 2‚Äù there so yea basically whoever showed up and answered the questions correctly about destiny 2 (or played it at all) got a free pack of cards lol
---
Awesome! Lol
---
Farm last wish chests for taken armaments for heavy ammo when you kill a blocker with a grenade (small chance you'll get the made kill but still worth it)

I go with blast furnace outlaw kill clip, that thing has ridiculous range and stability for a pulse, I've mapped people with it who were firing back with hammerhead.

The Mida catalyst is a random drop. You need to be in Legend in order to be able to get it, but it's not guaranteed.

Lmao was that even necessary at all?

Either way they can both be done very easily, no RNG involved so that's nice.

Cant tell if youre being downvoted because ppl think you‚Äôre serious, or because its such a good bad joke

That's a good look! r/DestinyFashion would definitely like this.

destiny 3 will probably be out 2020 so I‚Äòd say buy now

Just got lucky. There were a couple of big guys and they just happened to drop engrams right next to each other.

Infusion material.

Exit click has you leave the game the moment you do it. Alt f4 takes a moment.

Good Hammers, Hammerbro!
---
Ahh, strange terrain farming ain't bad just use lord of wolves.
---
Its amazing Ikelos SG still has such a strong fan base. I have stopped using it now for Loaded Question
---
I hate Crucible, and I always shake my head when I see PvP steps in whatever exotic quest I'm running. But you know what? It actually makes the weapons feel more "earned" to me; I not only had to put time and effort into getting the guns, but I also had to do it against other players.
---
I absolutely understand why people are mad they have to play a mode they don't like, but a large part of Destiny's endgame is grabbing exotic guns literally just to have them. If you're collecting to collect, you might as well get a sense of achievement from the weapons as well.
---
Dude....
---
I thought it was pretty cool, and then I saw the gun... 11/10
---
Is that a forge fusion rifle?
---
How do you get it?
---
(Plz go easy I got game in december for free)
---
Thanks!

I main a top tree sunbreaker so melting point/Ikelos is my best friend lmao. The thing does so much damage

It‚Äôs ding is different when it drops

I finally got the Geomag after praying to RNGesus for months.
---
Glad this meme is viable now that Xur actually sells forsaken exotics
---
TFW you can‚Äôt tell apart purple from blue
---
not quite as often, but if you spent an hour or 2 farming public events you'd be unlucky if you came away with less than a couple of exotics. that said exotics were mostly very underwhelming at that time (before the exotic buffs)

Yep, with a dragonfly spec mod anybody near by is dead also.
---
Thunderlord quest is available again currently.
---
I know but that's only for the arc week
---
Season of the drifter will have its own exotic quest which hasn't released yet
---
Ima have to give that a try!
---
YES
---
I just got a gnawing hunger with multi kill clip like 2 days ago.
---
Aksis would
---
Alright. I‚Äôve been waiting for the quest too and just assumed bungie gave us the thunderlord quest so they could hype an exotic quest but not release new content.
---
You have to sprint for 1.5 seconds to one punch an add and kill about 5-10, which activates knockout - which can 2-3 punch Ultras. You don't need melee kills to set it up, just a little tiny sprint.
---
Ahhh I see
---
Don't have the annual pass either eh :(
---
You want to increase your total average power, and when you hit the level cap, make your favorite weapons the highest they can be
---
I'm genuinely confused why people complain about accuracy with Wings of Sacred Dawn.
---
They're like: I can't land any shots.
---
Meanwhile: Landing mid-air sniper headshots.
---
160 refers to the number of SWFs (Sparrow Wing Flaps) like Horse Power but more flappy
---
Lol my lock is Llvl 10.  Fuck warlocks.
---
I,m not on here much did not see your comment sorry. Yeah if i was 15 seconds longer i would of lost the 100k soo defiantly close one. thanks man :)
---
What I thought the only way to get prime engrams was to level up post your max level
---
Tf
---
Why does that have health regen and increased duration? Titans been crying for buffs but between this and OEM they need the opposite.
---
Don‚Äôt take that thing to school
---
That is awesome!
---
I‚Äôm not having fun with the game in general anymore. It‚Äôs a grind fest that has proven to only be rewarding if you are playing comp.
---
Congrats mate ! It looks so good, must have taken quite a bit of work !
---
I used it for 1k kills but had to retire it as I finally got a not forgotten!
---
Fuck that boss especially during blackout.
---
Thanks for the info. But wasnt Oryx taken snd Crota hive? How could a hive be son of a taken
---
\*MISERUM\*
---
Soon they are going to start crossplay Fortnite was the first step but we all know that game sucks
---
Whatever they brought, they didn't bring Eva along with it.
---
Mean you have to complete the prestige leviathan that week to unlock the gun for that week. No curated roll as it is a year 1 weapon.
---
Midnight Coup should just require the normal leviathan. It‚Äôs perks will always be the same.
---
Yep with the system, most of THE parts r used
---
&gt;Also does the gun itself sell with the curated roll?
---
The term "curated" does not apply to any year 1 guns. No year 1 items have random perks. They're all exactly the same. So every midnight coup has outlaw and rampage, with zero exceptions. 
---
"Curated" refers to year 2 items that, instead of random perks, have a special set of handpicked perks. Some curated guns are great, others are only good in pve (such as the curated Nation of Beasts), others are just not very good (Warden's Law). You can tell if a gun is curated if it's a year 2 item that drops fully masterworked. 
---
Year 1 items can randomly drop fully masterworked, but it doesn't mean anything.
---
If you think black armoury and jokers wild have less content than warmind then I really can‚Äôt discuss this with you
---
It probably means you have the play leviathan on prestige difficulty. And about the curated roll it will always drop with rampage and outlaw roll.
---
Its the last thing ive needed for 15 weeks now, please dul incaru, gimme ur ship
---
Ya I had the same issue for a bit.
---
Shes missing for me too
---
Relogging fixed it for me, and going to to the tower fixed it for my friend. If you're still having issues you might want to talk to support.
---
Your feelings are valid. Others may not share the same opinion, but what matters is whether or not you enjoy playing. If you don't, then don't play. It is as simple as that. This game will be here waiting for you if you ever decide to return. What exactly is keeping you here?
---
Oh no back in D1 warlock was the first class I made I chose exo and I loved how in forsaken I could see his mouth glow again (he was painted black and when he talked his mouth glowed red very edgy)
---
Vorgeth gives me depression
---
So underrated!! Wardcliff is really good, but nothing shuts down supers quite like a Tractor Cannon
---
Just memories and the hope that penumbra will have something to bring me and fix everything, ive been playing destiny for about 4 years now and so far its made me really happy and ive enjoyed the experience but as of late due to meta and other things i just dont want to play it anymore
---
The weekly reset just happened 17 minutes ago. This means you'll have to do the next mission, I think it's called Oracle Engine. 
---
The three Dreaming City missions are on a weekly rotating basis.
---
Next year we get another annual pass
---
Yea.. no. Not always. But good rant. Have an upvote.
---
I would agree, though due to Edge Transit being a void weapon it gains an 'edge' in actual DPS scenarios when buffed by a TC. The only Aggressive frame GL with void damage is Swarm of the Raven, which I have yet to see anyone use with a good roll (nor do I have one myself).
---
You have to go back to orbit and come back
---
Ok maybe not jokers wild but im not changing my opinion on black armory that offered next to nothing besides what is equivalent to something along the lines of an April update sort of thing for what would be approximately 10$ but in all honesty i don‚Äôt care about that its just one of the small things that lead to this
---
Ah ok, thanks
---
I have an iron serpent right here for you. Nudge nudge wink wink
---
Doesn't seem to have any end.
---
True, true
---
Fun Fact: I have never unlocked the Sunbreaker Subclass in Destiny 2, yet I have all the metal triumphs for Supers in the game.
---
Everything is a laser on PC.
---
Well that‚Äôs not a word and also then wouldn‚Äôt it just be a Mexican standoff
---
Kinda neither. Uldren was being manipulated. The Ghost is just doing its job.
---
I agree lol. I just wanna see how the community feels
---
They could edit the image first, then use their phone to take a photo of the now edited image.
---
Pulled Pork is innocent.
---
yes! random or selectable ones would be good.. random would probably be easier to implement..
---
How much essence did you get? It‚Äôs 300 essence for arbalest so roughly how many runs of the forest do we need to do to get that?
---
‚ÄúEndless Forest‚Äù
---
We got to 127 on our first run then gave up, then realized that we didnt actually need to go that far as bosses spawn when its over. Kinda sad but we took our sweet time killing the final 5
---
Titans: 4 roaming superstar. Hunters: 3 roaming supers. Warlocks: only two. And one got needed to death. Good times
---
I don't know but her voice actor is the one who does the female background vocals (give it to me baby!!) to Offspring's "Pretty fly (for a white guy)" .
---
No its not the bosses spawn no matter what more branches = more time
---
I say Uldren, ghosts revive people who have the light, and are chosen, so I'd say that it has to be Uldren for murding Cayde
---
Infinite enemy spawns tho
---
I am sorry but hunters and stairs don't mix :(
---
How much essence did you get at the end for this?
---
You're right
---
You mean hunters and brains? :P
---
I guess it is working as intended - Well done mate!
---
How do upvote more than once
---
We hunters don‚Äôt need no damn stairs! We parkour our way up
---
300 and Party Hard triumph
---
&gt;parry this you fucking casual
---
First play through üòÇ
---
Hot take: Cayde could kick your butt with his hands behind his back
---
I guess that's your opinion with every popular character from any series or property that you don't like, huh?
---
Yeah probably...... if he was alive
---
Oh no, he doesn't need to be alive to beat you
---
Not necessarily. I enjoyed him in D1 but they turned him into a clown in D2. Tried way to hard to make him the funny character
---
He makes a valid point. Posts like yours pop up on a near daily basis. I guarantee with a couple clicks, you'd find hundreds of similar topics with the exact solution to your problem.

I'm listening to club Tropicana by wham... This really goes well with it

He had mobility mods last night

THE entire thing maybe $600 or something like that tho many used parts

Nice. It looks great

Damn, why would you say that in the Cayde 6 worshipping d2 reddit. Destiny has such great lore overall but ultimately fails to deliver it in game.

Cleaned it right after, even if u don‚Äôt have enough space. It‚Äôs supposed to be transferred to ur postmaster
---
Yeah I watched a video today that showed some testing for the best dragonfly/firefly type perks. Ace with chromatic can one shot somebody if they are almost touching
---
Not a problem at all
---
It's PC. The Recluse isn't that steady on console.
---
Ok?
---
Sounds like user error
---
Only a small % of the player base has ever done a raid.
---
\- It could be because raids are hardcore and most people aren't into that
---
\- It could be because 6 people is just too hard to organize for most
---
\- It could be because the LL requirements are too damn high
---
If reason #3 is the biggest reason, then Bungie is hurting their own game by walling off the "crown jewels" of Destiny content from a big chunk of players.
---
I‚Äôve just never seen that many orbs created. Makes sense given the branches and the orb generating supers/masterwork weapons, just a large number from my personal experience.
---
She needs to be level 50 for all of those things to unlock, at 300 LL she is probably around level 25-30
---
pls no not another machine gun, it's such a braindead weapon.
---
have you seen the new one from DOOM Eternal? The Grappling Hook? ....maybe be a catalyst?
---
Had mobility yesterday actually
---
That's good to know. I guess it's just the steps for Luna's Howl.
---
that would actually make it really cool, as you could use it as a short cut to get across, assuming you havent used any boost or jumps.
---
You mean Avalanche? There's not any context so I'm not sure what your meaning is.
---
One of the many reasons why I don't play D2 anymore.
---
Nobody cares about you either you fucking noob
---
Your fault for having a mess of an inventory mate.
---
It's active in comp? Looks like I'm never getting lunas or recluse
---
Yuh YEET
---
I run to spawn
---
Seems legit /s
---
27 wedge me in here!
---
TITAN SMASH!!!!
---
Lmao my fault I was just proud
---
I have a friend who is a hunter main, and I‚Äôm a Warlock main. He‚Äôs the only person I actually play with consistently. But anyway this friend who we will call Steve put me through hell numerous times since D2‚Äôs launch. A good 9 maybe 10 times Steve and I would hook up in orbit only for me to find out he had just restarted his Titan or Warlock. Every fucking time, I would delete my Titan I never use and run through the whole story with him again. Thankfully Steve has recognized the increase in effort each addition makes and has stopped deleting his lesser used characters. But god damn that turned into a task, we used to blow through the campaigns as fast as possible and grind the characters almost up to a decent level then go back to our mains and forget, until the cycle repeated itself.

thank you so much
