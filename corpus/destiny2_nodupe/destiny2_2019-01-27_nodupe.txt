Has to be forged weapons the show of force doesnt count.
---
ive been stupidly compulsive and reached 550/50 in 45hrs playtime total you can check your time at wastedondestiny.com!! now for the even slower grinding! least im caught up with my freinds after a latestarter woooa what a game tho!
---
There's people posting here basically weekly that they got it with a silver frame (or even no frame at all) and there's even a few streamers who had it happen live. You can also get it from a silver frame, if you carry it over into the next week; because it suddenly counts as a golden one in terms of drops (which is why they adress that in the upcoming patch). Hell, a friend got it from the quest step where you have to reignite one of the forges, without even having a frame on him. Sure those things could be bugs, but the fact right now is; You can get it without a frame.
---

---
Yet there's a swarm of people basically telling people to "fuck off and stop spreading wrong infos" on literally every single comment. Gotta love the retarded merd mentality.
---
Destiny 2 is a power fantasy game, it¬¥s all about making the player feel powerful. If you don¬¥t like it, then there are a multitude of games that offer your kind of experience, such as World of Warcraft, or I believe Warframe.

Aha. Just some try with Enlight. I‚Äôve start 2 days ago.

You don't want pc to crossplay with anyone. Imagine a bunch of console guys walking around when a pc titan comes flying in with no recoil. PvP would turn into a big steamy pile of shit. And there are small fire rate differences between pc and console because of fps differences. So good luck joining an lfg group if you're not on PC and can't get that extra 5% damage. Might seem absurd, but look at the absurd things lfg asks for. You don't have this weapon that is marginally better than the others? Not inviting you. Ps4 and Xbox could work though. 
---
Thanks !
---
Thanks dude !
---
He would have won, but they had a OEM too
---
No comments so here I am 
---
I'm sorry, rng drop that I have zero control over dropping at MY LIGHT LEVEL is overpowered? I mean sure I can buy it, but that's dependent on using an in game currency, which you saved up on your own. There's nothing overpowered about that, it's quite reasonable 
---
oh alright that's what I thought. yeah I get exotics from the eververse stuff all the time then. Never from Prime i think(?) maybe trinity ghoul?
---
We‚Äôre do you find Xur? Or is he annual pass?
---
There should be just an annual pass option. Check the past store online on a website, not a phone. 
---
Congrats. I got mine about a week ago, and my comment at the time was ‚Äú thank god I can put away the auto rifles now‚Äù. 
---
I think I‚Äôve swapped away from it twice. It‚Äôs too much fun, especially with Luna rift
---
Yep, I‚Äôve had a Sins masterworked for a while and it‚Äôs fun but not better than auto loading 
---
Yeah I was counting bright exotics. I need all the morale boosting i can get 
---
I didn‚Äôt know it was manual I thought if enough people reported slackers it‚Äôd ban them 
---
Yes, but the last time I pointed that out someone said it was a bug that was fixed, and I was unable to find any information about that. So I am trying not to say what is and is not possible since I don't know for sure. 
---
I wonder if this doesn‚Äôt in some way have some relation to what being close to a singularity might cause? 
---
Isn‚Äôt it quite like Savath√ªn‚Äôs attempt to slow the tithe‚Äôing process so it was almost nothing at all?
---
‚ÄúShe had previously attempted to increase the rate at which her subordinate Hive gathered tribute for her, by placing an Ascendant Hive in orbit around a black hole. In doing this, she had hoped that because time would pass more slowly for the Ascendant relative to the outside universe, the Ascendant's Worm would perceive an increased rate of tribute produced by lesser Hive elsewhere in the cosmos, and thus send her greater tribute in turn‚Äù
---
Of Course her Worm realized what she was doing and simply increased its hunger so this plan didn‚Äôt work out as planned. 
---
Warframe is more of what you're talking about with Destiny, believe me.  WoW is far from skill oriented given how rotation heavy it is.  Destiny 2 USED to be what I wanted, but then things got so toxic that r/lowsodiumdestiny had to be invented, then it became a power fantasy by numbers/gear instead of by gunplay and abilities.
---
I'll have to stick with Dauntless for now since that game is literally just Monster Hunter combat with scaling.  I just thought it was worth checking to see if D2 has done anything.
---
Hell yea. Guardian, i love you.
---
&amp;#x200B;

This gun, and a legendary auto rifle from the Halloween event, are the only two guns in the game whose level requirement maxes out at 20 no matter how high you infuse them. 
---
It's the only exotic that has no lvl req due to how the quest came out. Anyone could get it and use it since it was a global - no expansion exotic quest.
---
The guns that drop randomly from forges, *not* from frames, which have numbers at the end of their name do not count. 
---
If I said I finish 3-4 how is that bragging üòÇ but okay buddy thank for the reply! 
---
probably breathe out of their mouths too..
---
Reminds me of U.R.F The Manatee.
---
The only activities with a higher chance of giving you exotics are challenges. These are the gold circle icons in the director that refresh each week, so they aren't endlessly farmable. 
---
Make sure you have done all exotic quests. [This page](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-01-10-destiny-2-exotics-list-exotic-weapon-exotic-armour-4747) lists how to get every exotic in the game, including those from quests. 
---
What. The. Fuck. You‚Äôre OP. 
---
The hardest part of the Ace of Spades quest for me was the 25 precision hand cannon kills in the Crucible. Rumble was helpful!
---
There‚Äôs a ton to do in the game, but it‚Äôs at its core very reliant on repetitive grinding. The raids in this franchise are some of my all time favorite video game experiences and are quite challenging.
---
LMAOOOOOOO JUST SEEN THIS I was obviously just trolling him. I couldn‚Äôt resist, I‚Äôm 15 and he made himself such an easy target. I couldn‚Äôt pass up the opportunityüò≠üòÇ
---
Queenbreaker, probably. Thing basically aims itself.
---
With two AFK teammates, OP would basically behave the heavy brick spawn all to himself.

It's not harming anyone, if they're willing to throw IN A GROUP, then there's no problem. Now, if it was a 2 stack with 2 other random players then I could see you getting mad at that and it being a problem, but it looks like that's not the case. Besides, if you happen to match with them, that's a free win. (I know that some people don't like being given a win for nothing but we can't control what other people do.)
---
I've never bought one of those boxes before, but check to see if you have to manually open them. When you get an ornament, it appears in your mod inventory. You have to manually unlock it in order to use it. This is so that people know what ornaments are, since it is possible to get ornaments for items you do not have. 
---
Fuck off.
---
yeah it just..doesn't exist?? it's like wtf.
---
ik that much, but it's like nothing appear? i just basically got the silver back?
---
So just trying to load the game throws a code at you?
---
Weird, I‚Äôd ask bungie support or something along those lines. 
---
That's so weird! I suppose you could try posting on the Bungie support forums. 
---
2 exotics 
---
Thanks!
---
That coming from your side, my best bet is your on wifi in an apartment building full of wifi.
---
If not then I would check lost packet to the place your playing
---
What does ktdw even stand for
---
Slap a rampage mod on it and never look back.
---
*Screams in light*
---
Yep
---
I'm wired but in an apartment building 
---
Interesting. Thanks for replying. Sometimes I go heavy lifting, other times pump action... Not sure which is more effective. 
---
I would google how to ping google and check in cmd how much packet lost your getting
---
One more question can you show the rbg of the gold color
---
Eyes were definitely not up. Lesson learned 
---
Ah k

I hope I dont have to run mine again after the fix. But if I do I do lll

Dual-wield them.

When you pick a Metal as a material, rather than picking a colour you pick what kind of metal you want (Copper, brass, Iron, Gold, Chrome, etc)
---
Lol. I've watched my rocket to a instant 90¬∞ turn into a drug before.
---
Duck me in my duckin ass. I can‚Äôt get a forsaken exotic to save my life! 
---
.......I.....I don't want to talk about it....but thank you
---
I have rapid hit/rampage. I use a backup mag mod that I‚Äôm happy with, though I put that on before there were rampage spec mods. And I don‚Äôt have a reload masterwork. 
---
What armour sets are they?
---
This has been the only way I approach the pigeon lady, unless I‚Äôm coming from the Annex.
---
I got the malfeasance and chaperone out of that game as well so It felt real nice knowing what I did lol :D
---
You deserve that que you disgusting OEM user.
---
I had alot of pressure on my back during that game but the doctor said I will be fine
---
Daaamn
---
We need a hunter subclass called beast master and the super is spawning in a chicken drop squad
---
Spongebob'onlyFuckingExoticIDontHaveForMyWarlockMainAndIhateIt'pants
---
Ikr, today I got gwysin vest lmao good rng
---
I have the vendor Bygones too. I‚Äôd use that over the Go Figure but you have to like full-auto on a pulse. Now if the Go Figure had Outlaw/Rampage, that would be a different story. 
---
How did you get it??
---
You ok, op?
---
You have to forge 100 frames
---
Probably Midnight Talons for the hunter, idk about the others.
---
Oof which forges specifically or is it any
---
Any. From 70-100 I did auto rifle frames in Volundr because the frame is quick and easy and Volundr is an easy forge. Plus you can work on the frame step (30 precision kills with an ar) in the forge and then get all your seeds in the forge while farming modulus reports so it completes a few things at once. 
---
155 Volundr completions now lol. Rip. 
---
That should be more than enough destiny is very well optimized on PC!
---
Thanks Imma go do it rn
---
Oooh, yeah I have one, didn‚Äôt know I could only have one. Thanks
---
Nope, it‚Äôs a random drop
---
This post is hilariously out of touch.
---
Honestly not sure if there are people that *dont* use this
---
Wow. I got it from Ikora not too long after I got blade barrage. 
---
Efficiency is a useless stat tbh a 2 efficiency isnt even good 
---
Good thing this game has no agility stat
---
And where everyone knows your name
---
Sounds like someone is extremely salty.

I think it was.

Were you in a fireteam?

Humm... can I know what is the one hit hunter ability? 
---
Continuing on ounchy boi supremes point ... 
---
AoS is underrated and helps with ohk using spikes
---
Rangefinder and snapshot are both underrated. You know that frustrating situation where the guy should have been blown to bits but shottys you unphased by your GL?  Rangefinder helps with this.  Handling and reload masterworks are underrated. You gotta think different with GL's . They are slow so anything that speeds them up is top tier. Your either gonna ohk or not. Damage perks on GL are  overrated.  Many say FL won't OHK TO THIS DAY!!!!  AOS for the head. 
---
Open up other player's character screen to see what they are using iirc
---
It wasn‚Äôt the buffer week for NF as it was the first week of Season 5. It‚Äôs 87 wins straight from 0 Glory to 5500. 
---
I am in total agreement, Telesto can fuck right off. 
---
So I just recently discovered this but you can shoot the middle of their shield where it's orange. And they will drop their shield. This whole time I just been driving over the shields and shooting them from behind. 
---
This is why I use the skybreakers oath. Also because idk what Im doing and its one of the few exotics I have
---
Maybe he was bad but the super also sucks
---
ye we thought we had to do that, it was a pleasant suprise when we didnt
---
But uuhm, this is a bad roll. Like.. Really bad.
---
When you bought forsaken solely for using the chaos reach and still don't have the geomags....

I'm fairly new to the game myself, but if you set your fireteam join rules to public, people can join you by typing /join &lt;battletag&gt; in chat. Don't know if there's a way to invite someone in the same way though.

Wow lol I run loosing games all the time with randoms can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever thought to hate mail them for the loss. 
---
yeh, I think it's the game speed that gets me down.
---
Warframe has lots of running jumping sliding, this reminds me of Boarderlands if it was a Chinese F2P MMO..It's an okay game not worth the money.
---
I actually started playing it because I heard it was like warframe and I've done everything in Warframe so wanted to play something until I get RE 2

Thanks (:

Crafting from the Exotics Collection page, yes they'll always have Traction and Primary Ammo Finder. However they can be found as drops without Traction. My clanmate was unlucky enough to find a pair without.
---
A blueberry: Nah, gonna jump into the portal to escape the invader and leave my team to their demise.
---
Rampage, outlaw, accurized rounds, and handling masterwork... I think you have found it

By the time I make that logical conclusion I get sniped by a sleeper or queenbreaker

I don‚Äôt think coding would be hard enough to make it for all 3 characters
---
Yeah there is a glitch where you can equip the helm after using the super that gives the damage and extra shots, but bungie is already working on a fix and that uses half your super changing the gear. 
---
Because variety is fun! 
---
*visible confusion*
---
Yes, you would get loot on your Hunter on the first three.

It's not mine I found it

Sorry I didn't know who the original artist was

Fuck.

Agreed.
---
Thats a good fix.
---
Spoken like a person who has no idea how to code, they‚Äôd have to completely change how bounties work
---
You don't need heavy ammo if you are the heavy weapon - A Titan
---
I'll take on for the team and go fight the invader if i'm not holding motes. 
---
No I used to use it but not anymore
---
Nice shoes
---
You can save a few load outs with 3rd party apps. I have an Amazon echo and I just tell Alexa to equip my raid gear, nightfall gear, crucible gear and it instantly equips my loudout in game. 
---
I gave up doing this when I died three times behind cover to a Queensbreaker headshot. 
---
Yes! Yes! Yes!
---
I dunno why y'all hate on the Phalanxes. I think they are pretty easy to kill.
---
Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey
---
That's what I do. And quite honestly, it's very exhilarating to chase them down guns blazing.
---
Hell Malfeasance is a primary and it rips invaders a new one provided you‚Äôre not very far away. 
---
You can absolutely kill an invader with a Heavy if you play well. Machine Gun? Well I‚Äôll just pop in and out of cover and take single shots with Malfeasance until you‚Äôre dead. QBB? I‚Äôll bait your shots for a while by making you think I‚Äôm about to expose myself. Etc. 
---
I do have internet issues with other games but at least I can play them most of the time. Destiny 2 is the only game that continuous denies me access
---
I was just hardcore missing him the other day and his weekly treasure hunts.

Must be because you don‚Äôt have a solid enough connection.

With outlaw/rampage I'd prefer a larger mag for PVE, either via a mod or a perk

I literally have like 10 motes snd I'm stuck having to fight invaders due to teammates not bring smart enough to shoot them or keep them in cover with surprising fire while banking
---
How do you know that? You're entire statement is conjecture! How do you know what bungies decision making progress is?  This is a forum for discussing bungies game I'm not sure it requires the same burden of proof as a court of law.
---
But if you want to carry on claiming it's so hard for bungie, without any proof, go ahead. If you want to cite their not making a bounty global as proof that they cant, or that it's too difficult, go ahead. 
---
This post was to suggest that they #should# make the bounties global for certain quests. 
---
Someone went 0.5 k/d in their last couple games huh, ouch. Happens to the best of us my friend.
---
You summed that up beautifully
---
My mistake, thought it was sentinel shield
---
I too haves hoovered somes motes ins my days.
---
I'm very excited for that, still probably gonna prefer arcstrider for PvP. The no damage reduction thing just gets annoying. 
---
I use warlock so I never have that problem üòà
---
Arsenic bite. I know it's crappy but it was my only and first bow before I got the DLC. After using it for so long, I got adjusted to the scope (weird but still there) and I was getting better at it. Then I deleted it for some space for higher level ones. I just got another but it's too low for me right now 
---
Well if you actually read what I just said that answers your question

Oh well, I just assumed my memories where of my teammates getting the last person.

I haven been ‚Äúmarked for Vengeance‚Äù
---
Nah I get that dude but, this guy was at the bottom of our 4 man and he was calling us trash 
---
eh with how many people in gambit that are oblivious.. im not gonna just purposely get 5 and bank when i could take a few more seconds to get the few laying around me to get to the primes quicker... yea 5 is good but if youre leaving motes to purposely bank 5 everytime, youre losing so much time and actually making it take longer to get the prime out... purposely get 5 run half way across the map to bank go back half to get 5 more then back again just to make sure its a phalanx... naw im good that literally loses gambit matches and people saying they make sure they get 5 no matter what are the oblivious ones im talking about.. and then there is prolly 2 more motes need and they just sit there expecting some else to go pick them up and bank it when they easily could have grab 6 7 8 9 motes before and still bank and had the phalanx they wanted... so no 5 and bank is actually the dumbest thing you could do in gambit as far as banking goes.. 
---
It's not available in your collections unless you get it as a drop. So, if your ship came with that transmat effect and that's the only reason you have it... It's not available to reacquire.
---
It‚Äôs disabled for a lot of multiplayer games because it gives you a massive advantage 
---
there is a huge social concept with this, of how people see the invader red and just run, I think it takes about 4-5 games of holding 15 motes each and getting womped to even consider that maybe, one should drop what their doing and go on the hunt. I would love to see a mathmatical formula of how many times it takes for people to loose all to stop hiding
---
Oofie, be ascendant and you'll be riding around in style üòé

That knight is wearing a helmet that just happens to have antlers. 
---
Bounties that give you like 15 points and crap loot.  Especially if you're referring to the bounty that requires you to bank enough motes to send each kind of blocker to the other side.  Gambit bounties have never been worth it.  All I ever get is armor and the same weapons over and over again if it isn't a measly amount of points that makes almost no difference.
---
Not all heroes wear capes. Awesome.
---
I still don‚Äôt understand how to get to Cayde‚Äôs patrol though.
---
its got the same ttk as lunas howl at crossmap range. yes very shit
---
I never got use to warlock in d1
---
Amen 
---
Leave it to a hunter lol
---
Oh really, what is it?
---
guess it'll be the next meta then right oh wait no it'll never come close because in a month of its release people dont care for it 
---
1 little kill doesnt make it a good weapon 
---
Now this is pod racing.
---
The quest for Cayde to unlock patrols no longer exists. Patrols just unlock spontaneously now, since for story reasons Cayde has left the tower. 
---
Thank you; so I will take it next time
---
Got it! And it's awesome! 
---
*facepalm*
---
Love the beat of single shot to center + Knife Trick ( = gimme that helmet (though the black tears are tragic/icky ; ).
---
Also, Sunburner's Oath could use a buff (beyond the admittedly rather neat hipfire tracking shots thing). Imho, should be equivalent to a decent hand cannon/bow shot considering how week the ADS zoom is. (Got excited when Calus' Promise ornament dropped for it during Forge but, alas, seems it's still sad. : (
---
Has that that thing been around forever or is it actually kinda new?
---
Question : do u need annual pass in order to get it! 
---
Everyone here disagrees and you still think you're right 
---
Just see how well you do against pulse rifles 
---
This made me laugh out loud thanks 
---
I hate being in a 3man and things like strikes and forges start up instantly before you have a chance to exit queue
---
I don‚Äôt mind that guy. I‚Äôm way more concerned with how many you drop. If you wanna pick them all up have at it. Just don‚Äôt drop them. 
---
Playing a game mode worried about who has what quest is neglecting the mode itself. The fact that some bounties and quests are counter to a game modes objective is just silly design. You can‚Äôt run around all the time worried about that. Just try to win. 
---
Get a fire team if you want to play counter to the objective. 
---
No silverware just like Lord Sladin intended

You can have loadouts with Destiny Item Manager. I know its annoying having to use a 3rd party app, but it is nice.
---
If it's not being used widespread as what the community considers the "meta", it's not "the best by far". Perhaps you really like and do well with it, but saying it's the best by far just isn't truthful.

Lol you can be sure i died shortly after

How does one even have girlfriend while being a guardian!

---
Haha I get you, it was only designed to be a wedding church type of thing so not as dark lol. It's other name is the wedding palace, the architecture represents the act of marriage as a symbolic and anatomical conjoining.
---
I'm thinking the same thing. Luna's grind prohibits the "Starter" part.
---
90% of the time I am facing queenbreaker and most of the time I am faster
---
True 
---
EXACT SAME ROLL! 
---
Maybe you should go shoot up some hive?
---
Yeah if you have any motes and get them in consistently we're fucking golden.
---
If you take a bunch of time to get 15 motes then jump in a hole/get screebed/invader killed then I might be raging at my screen.
---
I'm not doubting your ability but this does nothing to prove your point since it doesn't show your loadout.
---
There‚Äôs been an increasing number of players not knowing how to properly do gambit matches with all the Christmas Guardians.
---
If you pass by the bank holding 4 motes and you have 21-24 or 46-49 motes deposited already you should ALWAYS BANK YOUR MOTES. 
---
Having your portal active so you have the opportunity to invade when the other team has a lot of motes held but not banked is HUUUUUGE. 
---
25/50/75 are the only numbers that truly matter in gambit. 
---
Crank that Titan boy and Superman that ho?
---
If there is something that I hate are people trying to max cap the motes to dunk them. They should learn that this isn't about high score it's about efficiency. Doesn't matter how many motes you have; if you get killed with max then shit goes down and people frustrate. 
---
Consider: my potato level of aim.
---
Cool
---
i said its the best scout by far. it has the lowest scout ttk. thats facts not an opinion
---
The rampage mod? Ada sells them so I'm going to say yes. Minor spec or backup mag wouldn't be bad options, but the rampage mod just brings the gun to a different level.
---
You must read the quest step very carefully! A lot of Black Armory quests will have a check box that says "do this activity," and then above that say "under these conditions." You cannot just read the check box.

Or the Astolfo gay.
---
It's a female hunter
---
I feel like Bungie is trying to tell me something lol
---
have you tried queenbreaker?
---
Probably some that does damage from far away
---
For boxed breathing you have to be ADS, meanwhile someone can slip under your radar and get to you before you even can react
---
You gotta establish your dominance
---
Someone backed out after the match was set but before you started flying in. There is a 5-10 second window there. It's how sometimes you will land with 0 enemies
---
The trick to collecting 10-15 is doing it quickly. I‚Äôll regularly bank 10+ but that‚Äôs because I can collect them efficiently after blowing up a ton of ads using tether, sweeping through the area (while invisible) and then running immediately to the bank. Even then, I try not to do that too much when the other team is closing in on 25 and 50 motes banked. 
---
Crimson with the catalyst has insane range, I‚Äôd recommend a shotgun instead.
---
Crimson is basically an exotic sidearm, plus it heals you after you get kills with it, so definitely an upgrade to the smugglers word.
---
Each map only has 3 invader spawn points. Learn them well enough and you can be in position right when they teleport in. A lot of good that Queensbreak does them when they take buckshot backshots before Drifter can even finish saying "You're invading! Make a mess."
---
Easy, just don't shoot him
---
I would have to disagree. Each round if done right several people can get 5 and you have to run past the bank anyway to the next area. 
---
Hoarders and players without situational awareness will have more than five and take another mote even though the character next to them has 4. 
---
It‚Äôs weird how I‚Äôll play like a god and drop a 90 mote games and be stuck with blueberries who use a blade barrage to invade during out primeval and I‚Äôll lose 20 the next game when I‚Äôm with 1 or 2 decent players

---
So true, someone mentioned playing D2 is like working a second job. Just got into the game 3 weeks ago after owning my first ps4 pro and I find it very soothing and fun when you just want to get lost and kick ass or get your ass kicked. 
---
Nope, it's just luck
---
Honestly I‚Äôd just rebuy the exotic sparrow of your choice until you get instant summon, the 10% extra xp ghost is so much more useful.
---
Most of the people you‚Äôre complaining about don‚Äôt visit this sub. You‚Äôre barking up the wrong tree 
---
[deleted]
---
Well first, what class are you playing, and do you have the forsaken expansion?
---
If I had one I sure would.
---
Yeah... I don't have annual pass so fak me
---
First, I apologize for my inaccuracy. Apparently, I can't read and understand English today. I was reading that as the best rifle by far...which I was including pulse and auto in that.
---
Now is the low ttk only with Box Breathing or is it period?
---
Blueberry with a Luna? I must be really bad at this game 
---
I‚Äôve had this happen more times than I can count lol 
---
This is why I always try to have five or less notes on me at a time. Most invaders don‚Äôt like being actively hunted.
---
When you played hunter yesterday and today you switch to warlock, you try to dodge behind a wall but instead you throw down a well in the middel of a fire fight like a knob 
---
Got one with Outlaw/Ricochet/Rampage. She's beautiful
---
I agree with you 100%. You know the situation and watching the mote meter on the other team.  Unfortunately 80% of the player base does not have the foresight to do that. 
---
i fuck ur mom instead 
---
Just go Celestial OMEGALUL
---
I almost never go for motes. My main goal is to kill as many enemies as I can, deal with invaders and invade as much as possible. Typically I end the match with around 40 guardian kills
---
Yup. The deflect drives people nuts. It's nice to see an active defense action in a super too. It doesn't hurt that I feel like a Jedi using it either. Lol.
---
Over time those measly amount of points add up and its a couple less games i have to play to reset my infamy. Plus enhancement cores from the gear that drops if ur lucky
---
I can‚Äôt tell you how much time I spend screaming at the screen over a rogue blueberry collecting 15 when we have 74 motes in the bank, or inevitably running back into the fray for just 1 more mote. 
---
Ive only got one exotic ghost so its fine (Ive been for about 2 months now or something like that) 
---
all cool man. only with box breathing, makes it a 3 shot instead of 4 shot
---
Pick whatever class you feel the most comfortable with. Use your highest light level gear until you hit soft cap.
---
Base game = 260 PL soft cap
---
Forsaken = 500 PL soft cap
---
Do you have forsaken or nah? And what platform do you play on?
---
Awww that Cabal just wants a hug
---
Yah especially on that step where you loose x2 points for every mote you lose 
---
You can also do the first encounter of the raid, but waiting until next week is proabably easier
---
Couldn't you just see the little "Biotic Enhancement" badge pop up on left left side of your screen? Pretty sure that works passively like surrounded does. 
---
Maybe they're in the cosmodrome? lol
---
Agree to disagree I guess.
---
Bow if you're good with them. Or another Handcannon like Trust is nice. Machine gun heavy to get some extra range.
---
This gear is fire 
---
That‚Äôs just sad. 
---
You can‚Äôt go throwing shade when you‚Äôre the one getting carried, lol. 
---
My buddy got two just doing Blind Well clears. 
---
Medallions + crucible worked for me
---
I would say that I couldnt agree more, but Im feeling that not many players are thinking about what is needed for your team atm (eg catching up with motes fast [use ult], killing at least 2 as invader to catch up with priveval, etc). Maybe because its not a ranked mode (i cant say its ranked if you cant go down), nobody gives a flying fuck about it. Everybody knows that playing solo is a nightmare. Most of the times im trying to fit into the role that is missing (invader, wave destroyer [yes, using ult on that is also smart in some situations], blocker clearer, invader clearer, mote gatherer etc). I dont want to be top in the scoreboard. Thing that is repulsing for me is some players have this weird Alpha Male attitude, when they want to do every mentioned role at the same time and taking heavy every time and are not ready to compromise on actions.
---
Exactly dude 
---
I laughed way too hard at this
---
But, what's the most fun
---
Some non-meta weapons I quite enjoy are the Duke 44 (wish it had an ornament), Claws of Wolf along with snipers 
---
NO.
---
This aint xbox 360 young man you'll have to try harder than that if you wanna get carried through last wish again
---
D3?
---
Gambit is really hard to solo nowadays. Honestly you‚Äôre better off, like they said, doing LFG until you find a good group. If you‚Äôre on PS4 I don‚Äôt mind helping during curse week next week.
---
PVP using fireteam medallions + 10% XP ghost.
---
I leveled my titan in a day and half.
---
It's good, dw. 
---
[Me](https://imgur.com/a/Ch8eJn1) when I get hate mail from a fellow solo queue gambit player saying I don‚Äôt know how gambit works.
---
Any time I'm playing with a team we absolutely always bank when we see the opponent can invade at their next deposit. If you're close to the next size blocker and two of us are banking then you have time to grab one or two more, but outside of that we never have significant motes when people are about to invade.
---
Sometimes we'll sit next to the bank with our motes to bait them and bank as soon as they pop in. It's a great way to prevent them from holding on to invades because they see you don't have anything. 
---
It looks bad. 
---
That's what I hate about certain game modes, you NEED a team to win. That'd be much appreciated, add me, my user is L_TheMcreeMain_L
---
Agreed, but at the same logic if you have a bunch of motes don't go charging head first
---
What gun is that?
---
You can literally aim at a belly button and get a headshot.

My comments have been getting a "something went wrong" error type message as well so I accidentally posted like 3 times of one comment. 
---
only if I had a fireteam...
---
Oh oh oh!! Is that...yes it is!  It‚Äôs another competitive matchmaking post. Come look kids!
---
The anthem demo is keeping people from playing the anthem demo, half the time the servers are down the other half it‚Äôs the infinite loading screen
---
Any guides that are pre-forsaken are almost completely useless as Bungie has turned almost every quest and its steps upside down.
---
Yeah man it‚Äôs rough. Gambit is one of my favorite game modes, but I only play solo for that one powerful bounty anymore. I‚Äôll send a friend request a bit later. 
---
I solo gambit a lot and while I do win it is
---
1. Stressful as teams
---
2. I am yelling at my T.V. Slot when my teammates act so stupid. Like no one helping to clear blockers. 
---
Ehhh 
---
Congrats bro... I got mine after grinding for whole month lol :) I am so bad in PvP but managed to get it.
---
Unfortunately this is 100% me. 
---
You can get it :)  I really suck in crucible but managed to get it.
---
# M A R K E D  F O R  V E N G E A N C E
---
Or learn to check those two lines on Mote meter to know that invade is coming 1-2 minutes before it actually happens... If my teammate is not paying attention to those lines and there was no blockers to bank before invade, i will be cooking my marshmellow in the corner watching you all die.
---
Come on, did you make so low effort to trigger people. At least say why you think it‚Äôs better than any other sci-fi.
---
EXACTLY, it's so stupid! I'm supposed to have fun in Gambit yet it feels like I'm always the person dragging my team along. There were two people waiting the whole game for heavy and invasions once. Like, who does that? 
---
It's too bad Gambit and other PVP in destiny doesn't involve more voice comms between team mates. I don't know that I've ever had team mates try to voice comm to me.
---
All it would take to deal with invaders is a quick call: He's at *location*
---
Then you have the ability to group up and play defensively, or if you have people who don't have motes they can feel free to go engage together.
---
Instead, it's just a clusterfuck where everybody individually tries to hide and hope they don't get found, which is dumb considering the invader knows exactly where you are at all times.

Took a while as a new player but now days you bank all the time and everything turns out so much better.
---
Now if we fight a Gaint darkness moth you will be the one to thank.
---
consider: tracking rockets
---
I did that a long time ago and didn't think it was too hard. I love invading my dude
---
Star Wars and mass effect might like a word. Destiny is a different type of game than either of these typically are (SW has been every conceivable genre though, it's true) and that doesn't mean it's better or worse in some objective sense... I like the fps mechanics better than anything SW has done, or the 3rd person shooting of ME. The actual science part of the sci-fi though? That goes handily to Mass Effect. That games encyclopedia/guide is bananas with realistic planetary information, lots of thought out dialogue about momentum in zero g environments, etc. 
---
it should be automatic, if I have less than 5 I'm hunting
---
I hope so, my faith in humanity must be resparked 
---
Oh I always invade solo, mainly because ik there's that one guy with the most atrocious load out ever. I do help to kill enemies/bosses, I just find it easier to invade tbh. But that's probably because I mostly play PvP 
---
Yeah it's pretty insane. I wanted one so bad, which of course meant it was the last exotic I got. I actually haven't used it in a single game because I hardly ever play Gambit anymore, my team got burnt out and I hate going solo. I still need 19 games for Breakneck because I play maybe once every three weeks, and because I use Cerb+1 for the quest I can never use Queensbreaker.
---
Even when I'm done with the quest one day, I think I'll be using Jotunn. QB is incredible for sure, but Jotunn seems to one shot invaders as well and is useful in SO many situations, and the ammo is infinite. 
---
I do the same, 
---
I have my Breakneck, Ikelos Shotgun/Jotunn, heavy machine gun. Well rounded for most rolls.
---
This too! When I have 0 motes is time to be agressive and defend comrades carrying motes. Not sure why it is so hard for many guardians to understand this.
---
I wish that I could use my Year 1 armor, because it looks so much better than 95% of the Forsaken armor!!
---
You and I are having very different experiences :/
---
I was making a joke about the mouth breathers 
---
That sounds like a good loadout to me, especially Jotuun because that thing triggers the hell outta me when I get killed by it. I usually run Blast Furnace, Loaded Question/Wavesplitter and Crooked Fang/Sleeper
---
Please random Gambit players let's do this! This thread needs to be pinned. 
---
Savage
---
That sounds like a good loadout to me, especially Jotuun because that thing triggers the hell outta me when I get killed by it, its tracking makes it aids. I usually run Blast Furnace, Loaded Question/Wavesplitter and Crooked Fang/Sleeper
---
Search around lost oasis 
---
Yeah, usually how that goes is like this: I go hunting the invader, I come face to face with him, he has an overshield so I die every time in the firefight.
---
He wasn‚Äôt being funny
---
Make it multipost. Same thread posted 5 times 
---
Also, love how shitty reddit is to tell me that "something went wrong" to the point where I posted the same sentence 5 times. 
---
Wowee congrats
---
Alright, now I fully understand. Thank you
---
On PC it's best to turn off auto hide chat

"The enemy is effectively using part of their kit"

"Those annoying bastards" 
---
Big mood. Huckleberry is pretty fun if you get the catalyst. 
---
Amen brother
---
If I am passing by the bank I‚Äôll drop my notes off.  I usually find that my team for some reason will kill shit and derp about not picking up motes.
---
I usually guard those who have 15 motes if the invader has come, and taken(pun intended) a liking in the guardian i‚Äôm defending. I usually have my linear fusion to kill from distance, my auto for close range, and pulse to assassinate from the shadows.
---
It all comes down to preference really. I have an arsenic bite with masterwork draw time and archers tempo. No bow comes close to how snappy that thing feels. *But,* Le Monarch is waaay better at clearing adds and at boss dps. I just dislike any bow with a draw time higher than 620, and thats pretty much all of them.
---
I agree I didn‚Äôt mean to step on anyones toes i was just extremely underwhelmed when I ended up getting it
---
Lunafaction Boots. They will also work in a regular healing or empowering rift. Doesn‚Äôt have to be a Well. 
---
only problem i‚Äôve noticed is servers
---
If all posts about pvp (regardless of game) are true then almost all players are awesome and everyone is complaining about the same 5 players. Coincidentally one is named Bill. The others are Steve, Zach, Amy, and Umberto. 
---
Arsenic bite and no turning back are static rolls like vestian dynasty. Only random thing is the masterwork. 
---
See here's the thing : You release a PvP mode (valor), and then alongside it you also release a competitive version of it (glory). Now competitive, in whatever game exists, is 100% sweaty,hardcore and something casual players tend to stay away from.  So if theres a broken element in it , like HammerofSol + OEM / spectral blades + gwysisn vest, its going to affect players who are sweaty AND players who are in between sweaty and casual. No one can predetermine that these combinations can be game breaking for competitive PvP. But people do expect the crucible team to be quick in their fixes. Simply put: it should not take 6 months for them to understand telesto and nerf it. It should not take them another 6 more months for them to realise Jotun is just as broken. Otherwise people will just quit after getting Lunas. And thats happening.
---
So if anyone wants to go for NotForgotten, there will be literally no population for him/her , the current matchmaking will never pair with 1k-2kglory , but will instead pair at 5k+ glory. So while they did change the matchmaking , it ended up backfiring and making it immensely harder for 3k+ glory to climb.
---
Now some will say that I am pigeonholing destiny for it, but look at Black ops 4: a week max. Zero(specialist) was probably nerfed even before full release lol. And Battlefield 5: the ttk of weapons was rebuffed back to its original value in less than a week.
---
That has to be one of the weirdest emotes. Where did it come from?
---
If you like it or not is a personal opinion! For my part i like grinding to an extend. If you like getting everything presented to you on a silver plate without earning it its your preference!
---
Thanks I‚Äôll check that out next time I‚Äôm on. I didn‚Äôt know that was a thing. I had only seen the option for auto join team chat. 
---
Und zwar Drang.
---
The game is awesome but it wasnt supposed to be out for every one yet so thats a problem as well
---
The game rounds up. You're at 99.5% kill a few more enemies. 
---
I thought it was just me! Three new exotics for me in 3 hours of playing this evening.
---
You are right, but the grind for perks is very minimal compared to the grind before! A midway would be nice...
---
Feelsbad 
---
I‚Äôm playing it right now. It takes some.. efforts.. to enjoy this game, but it‚Äôs not *that* bad.
---
Scourge Of The Past black armory raid
---
Do you need to just get that many in a single round? I'd suggest not focusing too hard on carrying 15 at a time as it's gonna annoy teammates if you lose em, but if you've got a fireteam to talk to they can essentially let you gather and bank more easily. I did that for the malfeasance quest with friends and when it was my turn they just left motes for me and I had like 80 in one round I think. 
---
One guy in my match today... We had enough to summon but he kept on colecting, so I head back to the enemies to pick up 3 as I realised he was gonna stay until he reached 15. He popped his super while farming those unnecessary motes. Used it to kill more ads and I still had time to pick up and bank the 3 we needed before he reached 15.
---
Then he did the exact same thing in the next round.
---
you barely talk to them, play nonstop and eventually they get jealous and start playing
---
that's the story of how my gf bought a $1,500 gaming pc with a 2070 in it.
---
Yeah, I tried for a while, put it down to do some other fame for a bit, then never had any desire to play it again. 
---
I need some of that...
---
Wait does it initiates the dps phase instead of the tank shot?
---
Happened to me too, it will stay for almost anything except restarting the game
---
Prolly waiting for whisper
---
Ohhhhhh. Awesome! I appreciate the info
---
Yikes...
---
This.  That said, I am okay with a game that rewards you for having a measure of social skill, right?
---
Down voted because im currently bored with destiny. 
---
Choosing each piece is good, I'm just talking about removing cost (shards/bright dust) or maybe just make everything for glimmer like the rares.
---
This right here. I don't think people fully grasp just how much of a threat the invader is. Invasions are not a minor nuisance, they're the biggest factor in determining the outcome of a game, more than the NPCs, more than the blockers, and more than the Primeval itself.  
---
My solo Gambit experience has improved vastly ever since I started bringing a Queenbreaker along; not to invade, but to counter invaders. It's tricky, but being able to defang the other team (and earn three free motes for the kill) makes winning substantially easier.
---
Does that work in grinding your way up to fable and would it be possible to reach it doing that before the season ends?
---
Nice, Luck of the draw I guess!
---
Regular price. Sales probably won‚Äôt be around this time, maybe last half of year tho.
---
God bless
---
I deleted it after the quest step was done. You don't need to keep it.
---
Except it is, what I stated are the biggest problems that are happening, Xbox couldn‚Äôt even play until the second day 
---
If you go into Details it has a lore entry you can read. 
---
I guess you could say she was taken by Oryx 
---
oh wow, 70 is reg price.  psn store says reg is 100 for forsaken + annual pass
---
For the last four weeks, I have gotten only Y1 exotics a day before they‚Äôre available at Xur.  Only one roll was better than those available at Xur...
---
Thanks
---
BOOOOOOOOOONE?
---
Problem is the tracking isnt as mad lad crazy as you think. Staffing to the sides can cause it to miss. It is still devastating to the unsuspecting blueberry clearing adds though...
