Thank you!!

I already explained myself in my comments. And you must not play this game or any game enough if you don’t know what that means. Look it up.
---
3 of the playlists are basically just control !!!!!!!!!
---
Yeah, hope they will include it the next season
---
Betternet
---
Okay bye then fella. I guess you dont get the thing about Options or the fact that OP asked about Coldheart or Prometheus. 
---

---
You basically pulled all this outa thin air and made it ur weird little mission to try and discredit something you already said you never used.
---
It starts health regen, given the time, depending on your recovery stat, it WILL fill up to full fairly quickly
---
No? There’s control and there’s momentum control. That’s really it and those two are played COMPLETELY differently. You don’t have to play control bruh play smth else like the free for all mode or elimination or survival bruh stop bitching
---
if only queenbreaker was good and a special weapon...
---
There’s still a year of content basically that will be coming out. Way too early to tell
---
You are so pretentious.
---
RN, yes sunshot, graviton, huckleberry, riskrunner  can and will outperform recluse, I seen it happen and did it, but other legendaries just suck tbh, even without recluse
---
For example, Monte Carlo, Cerberus and sweet business are way better then any other auto, I only use reckless oracle and gnawing hunger due to artifact mods
---
Someone who got a bingo apparently. (Actually wall of wishes for the shadowkeep raid)
---
Yea but most of the time cqc comes down to point blank shotgunning. Swords in special slots also lot you three peek round corners and delete people who want to rush you. Shotguns will still be present but swords would probably replace those for a majority of players. Also swords don’t require as much skill as shotguns.
---
Or you can do some research on the game you love so much. Instead of being lazy.
---
Guffaws in mask of the quite one

Thank you!

How you primarily play pvp and don’t know what SBMM is ?
---
Aw shit I gotta grind this weekend for mountain top then
---
How do you figure? This is truth.
---
I'm explaining why coldheart is not an option *fella*
---
Prometheus lens is good at what it does
---
Coldheart is not, like at all
---
I know but their emblems and their power levels and all the info. A clan admin or founder should be able to see these in game.
---
I'm new and don't really notice it that much, other than when I'm marking something at the very top of the map
---
Uh, I'm pretty sure pvp has nothing to do with pve nerfs. Bungie wants pve to be challenging. Which is why there were so many changes coming into shadowkeep. Nerfed infinite supers, damage perks etc. You can blame pvp players all you want but it doesn't make it remotely true.
---
Yeah... I fell for the Fighting Lion meme for exactly 1 game. I quickly realized that guns sucks big ass.
---
You were the one that brought them up. Yes, matchmaking isn't perfect but if you're good enough, you can still win.
---
My warlock exo is shorter than Eva 😢

They buried me in the sand and forgot me

Hold on, why ALL new light players? They aren't all hackers, majority of them are really good people getting into the game now that its free and not paid. The new light players are not the issue.

Wow

Fingers crossed, all we can do is hope.
---
Exactly. You could have just responded with what that acronym is but you’d rather me google it myself to make you feel better about your self. Literally the definition of pretentious? You think you are smart and not lazy for knowing gaming terms??? Are you serious ? What are your priorities ? Stop commenting on my post or have a reasonable discussion about the topic I posted on.
---
Have you *seen* the og Gambit sets?
---
I hope it's this. In reality, I hope she offers something useful for all this frigging candy
---
It used to hurt double when an OEM titan kills me, a titan main. Now it will hurt less.

There are a lot of companion apps (like destiny item manager) that allow you to move weapons to different characters without having to fly to the tower and manually go to the vault
---
THANK YOU! CAPTAIN AMERICA ALL THE WAY!

Maybe he was intentionally pew pewing

If they just listen to the community, it'll just become a hunter meta. Lol

And 4.4x multiplier for precision when fully charged instead of 3.3x
---
._. Most people just say the acronym. And as I said dude if you play pvp as much as you said you would know what it is. And I commented on your question. You asked more questions about my response and I answered and your mad about that? Lol.

I  wouldn't say top tree throwing knife is, pretty useful tbh, but bottom tree is. It does 130 on crits and 100 to the body, not really that good when you think about how tempest strike does 130 already.
---
I hope they buff it so that its 150 to the head and 130 to the body. That way you can throwing knife to the body and then crit with a 140/150/110, or you can crit with a 180 and throwing knife to the head.
---
Also, shoulder charge isn't really good for securing kills. You'll get to a certain point where you realize that a good player will always position well enough that trying to shoulder charge is a bad idea. Amazing for its added movement for titans though.

I dont comment on much but had to tell you to keep it up that is incredibly well done
---
Also Jade presumably using Jade Rabbit
---
They didn't kill civilians read the lore books. She evacuated the train and no civilians were hurt. They had her ghost in captivity. She also doesn't kill ghosts of shadows of your so no permanent deaths
---
Sadly.
---
I mean I'll still use OEM I get Wall hacks plus man... I just think it looks cool.
---
Throwing knife precision hits do about the same as a normal melee. Even if you have the blade barrage class and all 3 knifes hit a crit
---
Alright cheers, wasted my previous one after having to complete 12 dailys and 1 weekly cause I didn't know it was broken :(
---
Jees bro... its a game ... i picked the drifter because its just cooler ... im tired of not getting recognition by the vanguard , every chance i get of being on the bad side i just take it
---
No this is a grimour card, not hers, that I’m referencing.
---
I will smash his head of course
---
You shud be banned from match making, had this happen 2 times just now, so damn annoying...
---
Well, Xur is selling right now.  Buy the gun he is carrying and then exotic engrams.  The engrams can give you armor or guns.
---
Sorry I don't understand your question. If its literal then yes, PvP and PvE are different. But I'm sure you have seen Ghost perks that are only available in the crucible? That could be used on exotic perks as well and then PvE people are not affected by the PvP people.
---
Why can’t I save this image?
---
950-980 nightfalls
---
forsaken gets u more raids i think
---
Xur will sell you some every week, and some have quests, MIDA multitool is the easiest first exotic to get.
---
The rest are random drops from any enemy in the game. I’ve gotten 3 this month from public events.
---

Last wish is fantastic! But with a good competent team, Garden can be extremely fun
---
They should call it the ak-420 - cause it is very HIGH, lol
---
Holy shit this is def my new phone wallpaper!!! Great job OP!
---
I wasn't being sarcastic friend
---
980 nightfalls have a significantly higher chance to drop exotics than other activities.
---
there are some exotics you can get from completing exotic quests or have a chance to drop from a specific raid. Mida, and legend of acrius come to mind. there are a bunch others. Still, there are many that are random drops in the world but u can use fireteam medallions to boost chances of drops. Every little bit helps.
---

Granted in those days it and thorn could two tap at scout rifle ranges and was definitely fun to use but being able to challenge shotguns and be paired with snipers is what's its been for all of its lifetime

With the new warlock exotic, that increases damage on stormcaller as you kill enemies, you can wipe teams with it

i just wish I had one of these trace rifles, but no, bungie thinks I need 3 arbalests. got 3 of them in the last week alone :( then Banshee 44 thinks trolling me would be nice, so he gave me a daily trace rifle calibration bounty. arghhhhhh
---
Thanks
---
Oh wow your so smart. Congrats on that one bud.
---
Maybe I'll get it on my 51st run.....maybe
---
That is a beautiful piece. It might be my new background.
---
It doesnt really effect anything as of now, you'll get called a snitch by the drifter when u do gambit, but that's about it right now.
---
Its a shame because how I deal with OEM is once the titan gets an overshield, unlike most in this subreddit I leave the titan alone and wait for him to end his tantrum and then I strike, but people are more aggressive than smart I guess. Not calling them a dumbass... tactical. Is a better word.
---
i see some numbers on all my armor equipment and they have an element like the weapons, i know what the element on the weapons do, but what about the element on the armors?
---
Might be ricochet rounds
---
apparently it doesnt with my friend. the sturm quests if u mean. somehow it wanted a dropped exotic engram.
---
Maps rotate daily, you’ll have to hit max temper and destroy the shield drones. Best to look yo their locations.

Whether we wanted to or not, we have stepped into a war with the cabal on mars so lets get to taking out their command one by one; Valus Taaurc, from what I can gather, commands the Siege Dancers from an imperial land tank outside of Rubicon.

Just use the guns yourself and figure it out, they’re both really good. You might even just not use 21% with how good curated HH is.
---
I've never seen anyone cancel a rift on demand
---
Better go see xur. He has Prometheus lens this weekend
---
I got 2 headshot collaterals today. First on Survival, second on Momentum Control. The first collaterals I've gotten... in the same day.
---
I started using OEM more in pve when it came out because it served as a better Mask of the Quiet One
---
Shhh we farm up voted round here
---
Standards
---
10 hp is overpowered because of how much it changes how many shots you need to take our a person
---
Say something three taps boom now it 4 taps 
---
And if you are talking OEM
---
It now takes 4 shots to kill him PLUS he now can shoot you in 2 shots so it does make a difference
---
for real?? oh shit, thats awesome. where is he this week? I havent gotten time to play yet, will do tomorrow. thank heavens.
---
Yeah I see the rounds  probably comes from the other point. It's hard to see. It's been a while since I've played too but I can see it. But damn those gotta be some big ass rounds considering how far it still has to feed into the chamber and the capacity. Still wouldn't make sense.
---
Leviathan has an exotic shotgun , Last Wish drops 1k voices, Scourge of the Past has anarchy, Crown of Sorrow drops tarrahba[ or how ever its spelled]
---
nope, 3, however I only actually pop shield for the harpy missiles because I actually have NO clue how to avoid them
---
Because cosmetic. We barely see our armor in game but we pop up our ghost fairly frequently so why not have transmog for it.
---
Oh ok thx man. How is it going for u?
---
They should have a crucible game mode for this.
---
The Cold Fusion medal requires that you not reload or swap weapons, even though it doesn't say it. That is probably your issue. Once I read that I finished it quickly.
---
Also, Erentil and Wizend Rebuke with backup plan are both crazy powerful.
---
Companion app is back up. Sign out then back in
---
The answer is: it didn't.
---
Or rather, it couldn't have. Gear level is fixed unless you infuse. Either that or it's some kind of bug that it seems only you've experienced
---
Mm I'm just going to play regular and see how it goes thanks for the response :)
---
Maybe you looked at wrong when you got it and it was a 918.  Are you looking at the actual piece to get the light or are you looking at your power level on your character when you have it equipped?  The only time armor changes light in this game is 1) by infusion or 2) Bungie does a mass update and changes everything to a new light like the did with Shadowkeep.  I have never heard of anyone's armor glitching up in light.  If there is a glitch it usually goes down to 0.
---
Hey dude, I wasn’t in that game, but everyone’s gotta start off in crucible somewhere. I used to get maybe 2 kills a match when I started off. And now I’m usually in the top three. No matter how bad you did, you’ll eventually get better! And I doubt the other players minded.
---
Would be epic if they made a movie of this scene or just one big cutscene of just this and not be a disappointment
---
Unless this article misprinted I’m pretty sure, [buffs and debuffs ](https://www.gamesradar.com/bungie-details-major-destiny-2-class-and-ability-changes-coming-in-shadowkeep/)

So just as I posted this, the app is back up. Thx!

Check the patch notes not articles

What is: stormcaller, arc soul, rift, "Controverse"[sic] hold arms, void walker.

you can only do 2 per week. to get that exotic bow and jottun, you need basically 5 weeks :D im on my third week now

Live gameplay of the final boss
---
Yeah I was actually xD Small world
---
except that damned riskrunner last week and this week for a few hours. like seriously? riskrunners quest takes like 30 mins to do
---
Maybe in D3, if they're making one.
---
Im looking at the individual armor rating when i first received the armor piece I was a light level 823 titan now I'm a total rating of 918 and my helmet is 919 i know im not looking at it wrong because i had screenshots the piece when i received it to show off to my friends
---
And I thought divinity counted as a debuff, a-la tractor cannon? So if you can have 1 damage buff and 1 debuff I am pretty sure they can work together. I’ve used it in the new public events with people who were using divinity and I think it works.
---
I think the closest you can get to all-black right now would be Monochromatic.
---
Trust me thats nothing its when you pull 1k, anarchy, or tarrabah first time doing a raid that maies people mad
---
I always get killed by jumping into that circle too soon
---
I hope Mountain Top never gets nerfed so this painting can stay correct.
---
Divinity stacks with other debufs so melting and divinity stack and then a bubble for a total of 100% more damage
---
Great work
---
Ogres are actually tormented thralls
---
Shaxx is old school, he doesn't need this punk ass shit
---
Yeah, I just dig the kind of synergy you can use as a support type of class with them. Have people regenerating their overlord grenades while having a damage buff. Not mention me getting health regained from every solar ability kill.
---
Stormcaller is your arc subclass for the Warlock.
---
Controverse Hold an exoitc arm piece that is a random drop for the warlock.
---
Getaway Artis is an exoitc arm piece that is a random drop for the warlock.
---
An arc soul is an arc ball that floats above your head and shoots arc darts at your enemies for you.  Once you get the arc soul ability it travels with you for a set amount of time.
---
A warlock rift is the class ability for the warlock, you can choose healing (heals any teammate standing in it) or empowering (buffs weapon damage when standing in it).  
---
&amp;#x200B;

These are all basics of the game.

arbalest sword that damages shielded enemy? now that is an idea I would go on board with.
---
Im a Titan main and I think the Worlock armor looks so cool! Maybe I just miss my Worlock though haha
---
I came.
---
Great piece! But fuck that weapon 🤣
---
Man, the stereotype about Titans being dumb is  true, Defensive Strike gives 20 less health than Vengeance does. (75 to 95). Maybe if you had been paying any attention, or any effort in looking for it, you’d now.

Oh, do you know if resetting your valor rank does anything?

The problem is like, yeah, it's spray and don't even bother with skill. But it's that way for any smg in pve. I've been using exit strategy and it's just as brain dead in pve as recluse. And even outside of smgs there are weapons whose literal design is that you don't have to aim (wardcliff, truth, etc) but we probably won't see anything done to them that hasn't already. 
---
If you ask me, just make the pinnacle weapons exotic. That would solve soo many of the complaints.

Bruh, I just bought one of your prints!
---
I wonder how many people have noticed that every time there's a pvp pinnacle/ritual weapon, later up in the season something handicapped comes in that allows easy grind for the said weapon.
---
This time it was randy and momentum control is to have easy scout kills cause bungo knows that scouts are still pretty bad in normal modes so they kicked it up a notch
---
Disgusting
---
True.... but next-gen consoles are coming out soon. Maybe they could be able to run such a thing.
---
This happens a lot more than it should.
---
Yeah... don’t really know how to change the title. At least people will click on it I guess 😂
---
You legally aren’t allowed to complain about snipers. They are literally the only skilled special weapon in the game.
---
Listen up good people of the city
---
I'll try tbh I wouldn't think it would do anything
---
There’s also the idea of only spawning ads after some have been killed. The dead bodies should also have a limit though so it doesn’t cause massive FPS drops.
---
it just gives you legendary crucible items and tokens
---
For Ad clear I have a gnawing hunger with rampage and subsistence, which can be pretty awesome. I wouldn’t use it on majors or bosses though. But I think it’s a great alternative with the constant reloading with rampage
---
Where’s that Alkane Dust?!
---
Howls in eververse
---
Nope. Thrall become acolytes, then either knights or wizards, depending on the gender they choose.
---
But if some wizards torture a thrall with light in a ritual, it does become an ogre
---
Man dual primaries meta was slow as hell haha
---
Nice.
---
Yes, it's not the best weapon choice but it's still good
---
Stop spamming this shit picture.

Did you complete them as in killed the champion when it spawns or just finished it, because if the time runs out it counts as a loss. I hate the fact that not many decent players are doing reckoning runs because i have to do 3 more

Try freelaance, no stacks there and a much better experience.
---
Are you using cover? Baiting out the two jotunn shots? Playing your ranges right? In freelance it’s fairly easy to get to 2100.
---
Very much this. I’ve been so sick of seeing fighting lion, recluse and mountaintop in crucible lately. But I don’t blame the players for using the tools they have. The devs made a decision to make these weapons the way they are.
---
Damnit.
---
Oh is that what freelance is, I might try that thanks
---
Oooh so the hihe we’ve been fighting since D2 Y1 are Savathuns hive? Never knew that.
---
Do I need Lumina in order to put a mod on Rose?

Wasted 2 months of my life trying to get Recluse only for it to get nerfed to Oblivion. time to quit destiny. theres no fucking way im going to use Cuckleberry.
---
Lmao you could have tested it yourself faster than make this post
---
Go use it. Try to find a crowd EP would work
---
Nicely executed! Was it just two tailed fox and nighthawk?
---
One of the best minor/major enemy clear weapons. Used to be really good for bosses, but not as much now
---
This or being able to equip all ur exotics?
---
Shaxx, the OG striker titan with recluse and mountaintop
---
It depends. Powerful rewards I know very little about. Pinnacle is +2 up to 960
---
ngl even If it's real they charge so damn much for  shit like that, might aswell be scamming us instead
---
Stop your whining. I played 8 matches last night and didn’t see any one on other team using OEM.
---
Well most people hate doing pvp but want the weapons. I can’t say it’s a scummy thing to do because I’m sure there are people who have the money but not the time. It’s providing a service that helps people so I don’t think it’s a bad thing just looks a little shady.
---
Easy mode aginst this one: Mountaintop
---
Nothing else needed. Best fix for PvP would be to just remove nade launchers from primary and secondary slots.
---
Mayhem is a gamemode in crucible(Multiplayer) wherein weapons are more lethal. Its where you can easily farm a few quests
---
Hear me out. D2 overall. But all the armor sets yeeted out and replaced with d1 sets/style, with factions and trials added.
---
It still has the master of arms perk, only you need to hit headshots to make effective use of the damage multiplier.
---
In short, recluse takes some semblance of skill to be good with now, and not a crutch
---
this is how abilities and perks worked at the end of d1, no idea why people think this idea is new, they just dont do that anymore, when i last played d1 celestial nighthawk did enough damage to basically 1 shot any strike boss, the other armor was different too but i only used nighthawk enough to know specifics
---
I just dont get it. Recluse will be useless on conseles when the nerf will go live,not every one is god like player. I spent weeks hard griding before I got it few days ago. And guess what... Its just unfair, so sick of it.
---
your drawing skills are godly
---
Once again, 23 shards is nothing. Why not spend them and save oneself some time? 
---
I still did the quest despite having Riskrunner since vanilla. It's short, fun, and nostalgic.
---
Why spending 23 shards is **"a tragedy"**? What's the joke?
---
It's not like he's a new player who used weekly fated engram to get Riskrunner which could have been bought for 23 shards which could have also been obtained via short quest.
---
I don't get the post and your explanation. At all. Yes, I'm not fun at parties.
---
Agreed. That would make people angry.
---
It's all RNG. The loot pool in higher level activities such as raids or the like seem to give a higher chance at higher stats but I've gotten 60+ from anything, again all RNG. Also when you masterwork any gear item (including your class item) you get +2 stat to each attribute for a total of +12. Cheers and happy grinding
---
Just *unlucky* 
---
Even tho I wouldnt call completing 6 Raids without a mod-drop being unlucky

---
There's always someone better, gotta maintain a sense of humor about it when you get creamed by someone. But, not easy, competition sucks and hurts, it's a loser generator. One winner, the rest lose, every single game.

If this had a bigger background to fit my phone I'd use it in a heartbeat.

---
Damn, okey I think hunt continue :D , ty brudda.
---
I didn’t say anything else ever. Exotics should be better, future pinnacles could be better (more on this later), hell even a nerf so that MoA doesn’t proc on kills by other weapons would have been a small change that I wouldn’t have minded. I know the way it was before the nerf is better than subjunctive, but the way it is after it can be argued that the subjunctive is just as good. If you have to hit crits then feeding frenzy vs outlaw is a moot point. And then it just comes down to weather multikill clip x3 or MoA grants a better multiplier. Bungie is regretting pinnacles which is why they made the change to “ritual” weapons instead. It was only a matter of time till they nerfed the recluse and every other pinnacle, so I’m not surprised, just disappointed. By your logic though, even a few of the exotics like izanagis, anarchy or 1K need to be nerfed since those seem to be the only exotics used anymore in endgame by those that have them.
---
Jerking off front/back is not going to do much for you.
---
In fact, don't stand still, period. Even those of us who dislike PvP know we call people like that "targets".
---
Nah man nah, the best would be to get to experience golden age humanity before and during the collapse. imagine half-life 1 meets halo.. with the events of the new pacific arcology, the warmind rasputin and subminds like charlemagne, the exodus green and black, and humanity's final struggle to survive against the darkness.. omg that would make a fucking amazing and hopelessly dark game or movie, just like the hopelessly onesided covenant war against humanity.. please bungie do this i beg you!!!
---
Probably not. It was exclusive to people who finished all the triumphs last year, so I wouldn't be surprised if they kept it that way
---
Wanted, tank, free
---
Yea we are so  unlucky :( , I hope we get mods soon.
---
There are people who no-life with it, getting over 90k kills with it.
---
So. It finally begun
---
I played HC menagerie on all chars but still nothing... Im so super unlucky or idk :D but ty for tip
---
Damn, and I thought I no lifed destiny 2 o__o
---
finally can get to taste their bath milk
---
Knock knock upcoming recluse nerf would like to chat
---
This. I think quickdraw slidshot would be great as well. Since it's a rapid fire frame when you slide it loads 2 rounds instead of one.
---
lfg or r/fireteams
---
is that loss
---
Thank youuuuu!!! I have had to defend zones constantly and die because no one decides “hey lets defend these so we ACTUALLY WIN THE GAME” it’s rediculous IMO
---
Pluperfect is somewhat close I think
---
Scrota, Berries of Oryx 😂😂
---
u/dmg04 a nut has been thrown down
---
I think you still do but idk. Last week was supposed to be cerberus +1 but it was riskrunner for me
---
I used Polaris lance and found it really nice to use for Randys.
---
Why does mountaintop need a nerf ? That gun isn't op at all. I got it and it's not that great.
---
*i have a 0.2 pve kd* 😩😩😩
---
I got Cerberus +1 already so last week was a bummer. I didn't even realised he was glitched out until I saw this thread *facepalm*
---
I saw one a few days ago:
---
Fallen fuck this ass
---
It's rather comical since I have switched over.
---
Really well done though my only complaint is the lighting on the barrel of the Mountaintop is a bit off. Bottom 2/3rds looks correct but the top 1/3rd isn't correct.
---
All you need to do is kill the CEO of Racism and you’ve done it, you’ve saved the world.
---
It's the curated spare rations with overflow and explosive rounds, the Overflow perk, any time you pick up heavy or special ammo it loads the gun and then overflows the mag. Giving it 28 bullets.
---
Also I’m gonna have to talk you you about Hunters....
---
Oh oof. I wanted cerberus but when i got to him he only had Riskrunner. I though it was weird so i looked it up
---
Oh.. Thanks! I forgot about that one perk!
---
Have a great day :3
---
Joke aside your fashion is legit. Love the shaders
---
If only it was that simple...
---
I can understand where you’re coming from I just don’t think that you’re correct. It is not excelling in that category beyond other options. It’s not significantly better than a rapid fire shotgun nor is it significantly better than something like Loaded Question. It’s not the be all, end all like you say it is. It fills a role and it does that role extremely well. If you choose to use it because it makes the specific task you’re trying to perform much more manageable, that’s not a reason to nerf it.
---
He was selling RR at reset yesterday. I’m guessing he’s glitched again like last week, or been given a nudge by bungie
---
Imagine taking screenshots of Cammycakes videos for reposts on reddit 😬
---
*theorizing*
---
Oh. Makes sense
---
Randy's throwing knife with KC hits 63 per crit. 63 x3 = 189. 3 resilliance = 189. Your argument is invalid
---
Jump into the lake below!!!!!
---
It's a random drop
---
Also this screenshot is from a Cammycakes video where he says exactly what he's using and how
---
Maybe the lake is a metaphor...
---
Whoa, dude!
---
How do you get the werewolf cause I have the materials but it says I need to do some quest
---
I you ever played halo, there is a specific distance in which the energy sword/melee will lock on. That same distance is still used pretty much for a standard melee. The melee ability will have to be activated when not locked on for a hunter or when sprinting for a titan. Abilities are also on timers. So use it up and you don't have to worry about it anymore

I'm telling you guys ikore is high on void weed that's why she has two other versions of herself Hunter and Titan that's also high af on void weed and

that helmet is the opposite of fashion i am sorry
---
They don't always drop at 750.  Sometimes I get them at 950.
---
Yea use destiny app. Make sure get complete fireteam. It took me like 8 tries at final boss. Remember to kill both champion knights that spawn before finish boss. Otherwise it won t count
---
I want my crest of alpha lupi back for my hunter
---
I think my least favorite part of one-eyed mask wasn't that I had to play against it, it was that I had too look at on every single Titan. I looks likes a tightly stretched apron that someone glued some kitchen utensils to.
---
No it was a guardian named Kabr, Saint-14 died in the infinite forest looking for Osiris

The inverted spire

ohhh then I guess my friend was wrong but thanks for clearing that up

So rather the toilet bowl shoulder soldier wannabees, the disney prince dresses and the spandex ninjas. Gotcha.

Master Rahool:oh your approaching me?With a legendary engram!FOOL! YOU SHALL GET GO FIGURE!
---
Me:AHHHHHHHHH!the disappointment....;-;
---
I never get it because to me the zone capture quest is the easiest one. I usually finish it in my first 4-5 matches.
---
oof, my bad
---
Well played
---
It's been in the game since D1... 😑🤦🏻‍♂️
---
I hope so, VEX HURRY UP AND MAKE THESE APES EXTINCT SO I CAN GO HOME!

Imagine if Sunbracers is procced while running Contraverse hold and Devour
---
First of all, looking sexy

Second, grenade heaven

Add in nezaracs sin to get melee energy back
---
I would cry if I could watch that gameplay
---
Wait, are you guys not getting through fire and flood ever fucking other engram?
---
That’s the funny thing about opinions
---
I’m confused. Why would you be putting fingerprints on your screen when you know it’s loading?
---
Yes telesto is a beast
---
Ez
---
Seems legit
---
Better than every legendary set looking the same overall with few exceptions
---
HAHA YOU BUFFON! I'D TAKE ALL OF THEM!
---
“I’m right”
---
Noooooooooooo!!!!!!
---
That could work, smart! Thanks
---
you seen the EV ornament tho?
---
No problem :) 
---
It struck a cord with me a little as I suffer from anxiety and so playing matches or raids with others whilst talking tactics etc makes me really anxious and nervous and I find it makes me play worse so I tend to play solo. I know it's not quite the same but I can kind of relate. I also have a son who is autistic and he struggles in certain social environments.
---
It's become painfully apparent that you've run out of arguments to make considering you're relying on calling people mentally challenged and that you've clearly never had the ability to feel any sort of accomplishment as your parents never paid you any mind or cared for you during your childhood and you've taken to the Internet to try and vent your frustrations by making an attempt to rip into people but you just fail at that too like everything else you do
---
Everything in this picture screams germany.
---
fucking beautiful brother
---
Wat?
---
I recently decided that I'm going to grind for the Breakneck. And I must say, the Cerberus coupled with the Actium War Rig is making it a very enjoyable experience. It simply chews through ads in gambit.
---
lucky pants + dual revolver. that was my go to for a while
---
Go to the crucible and when you start the matchmaking just cancel it and you should get the quest to get the recluse.
---
This outfit is legit so dope.
---
Not disagreeing with you. But because the shader system is the way that it is, it's always going to be a mixed bag.
---
People dog on Anthem all the time, but their shader/color system is miles ahead of Destiny's. Hopefully with the next game the shader system will take after Anthem/Warframe.
---
I saw your reply the first time thanks :)
---
Or armor stats
---
Mark my words, 5 or so years after the end of D3's life cycle, there'll be a "remastered" trilogy which provides exactly that, plus D3 added in.
---
but the nine want u to have it!
---
Lmao! never change guardians!
---
The wall aplies the affect longer though. I think both have their place
---
This is it.
---
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
How bout now? lol
---
Thank you
---
Does lord of wolves still drop from spider bounties? Ive been told it dosnt since shadokeep but i javent found anything to confirm

Go to Amanda Holliday in the hangar at the tower and pick them up as quests.

Same post made about any game ever that has both pve and pvp

Currently my name is Thighlight Gap, don’t steal

I never ujse any hand cannons whatsoever, i don't think i am playing this game right

With double breachrefractor it has

It’s that bear from 5 nights at Freddie’s

Well grenade can’t get things in mid air and sometimes has a weird angle and it just doesn’t do that much damage
---
I have the entire set for hunter and titan I plan on doing this later thank you for the idea

Also I think I was killed by you also

Super underrated gun

There are videos of people soloing 980 master

It appears you are asking a question about Destiny 2 error codes or a bug. 
---
We suggest Google searching your error code for more information about what you might be experiencing, or posting in /r/DestinyTechSupport
---
how do you have two exotics
---
For my solo comp experience is like carry carry and more carry that’s why I play in a team even if it makes carrying a little bit easier for me
---
but do i have to own the weapon for its catalyst to drop? or can i drop catalysts of weapons i dont own?
---
Try to spec for recovery, i heard it's much better for survivability than resilience
---
I thought you’d be able to get it from buying fated engram by now.
---
When i have a mote or blocker bounty i rage when i dont get my motes. When i dont, i could care less as long as theyre getting banked.
---
As long as you have the weapon in your collections tab at least it should drop. They are just super rare!
---
What about gambit? Which category does that fall in to?
---
I think her design is super neat! So I thought I'd draw her before anybody else
---
Mad coz bad ? Getting tapped a couple times 8 can understand. But to be killed by the same thing repeatedly shoes a lack of something on your part.
---
It’s just lore, some cutscenes and makes your guardian actually know of the pyramid ships(it changes dialogue in the moon story). It had powerful rewards before shadowkeep but I suppose it just rewards normal world drops now.
---
Not only that but it's AoS and Trust. Love both of those hand cannons so very much.
---
And what about gambit?
---
Rimbus 3000
---
I have heard absolutely nothing of the sort. Given how difficult it is to prove a negative, my guess would be those people were just complaining about how they haven't had it drop, not stating anything factual.
---
My friend has 30 clears in scourge and 14 anarchy drops. 109 clears in last wish and one 1k. It’s just all down to luck.
---
Thanks, it's going to be tight.
---
Wtf
---
That's not rare then is it.
---
Oh ok, cool. Good job for hitting legend I'm 200 points away myself
---
Which is an important role regardless of the burn that week. You by no means have to have pinnacle stuff, in fact since it’s all Taken enemies (which use lots of arc) a plain old Riskrunner will do you well and generate orbs for your team. Don’t mistake dying a lot for not being very good at it, tier 3 reckoning is genuinely challenging for all but the most coordinated fireteams. Playing with randoms it took me at least a few days to finish enough matches to get my reaper set. I’ll definitely tell you don’t even try unless there’s a full lobby. 2-3 people basically can’t do it.
---
[You start with the Menagerie unlock quest.](https://www.shacknews.com/article/112089/an-imperial-summons-the-invitation-destiny-2) This is supposed to teach you the basics,  but a lot of people get stuck on the part that asks them to claim a triumph. This means going to the triumphs tab of the character menu, navigating to the Menagerie section, and clicking on it.
---
Isn't it the Konami code ?
---
"It's just a portal, it'll be fine." - Ikora, probably

Wait That's illegal!

Honestly, I'd contact Steam about it or issue a refund and then buy it again. Fortune favors the bold and all that.
---
Crucible is way better with this mode.
---
Grats
---
It's a meme weapon, its exotic perk is that it does more damage the louder you scream "Daka daka"
---
I just started playing and it was the first exotic i ever got from the banshee quest lol

Probably to get more of the New Light players to buy it. I mean, I started with New Light and just bought the Deluxe Edition for the extra season passes.

No, the pools of guns from Zavala and Shaxx were refreshed after the game had been out for one year. They were not refreshed after the 3 year point, though.

The items they gave back in year 1 are no longer obtainable.

Happy for you!

I appreciate it, but ive tried this and other methods 😂 still no luck. Thanks tho
---
I've never even touched OEM, cause for some reason I suck at using it, plus the actual helmet is absolutely hideous. On the other hand, the Skullfort is a magnificent piece of technology, and I only take it off for Synthoceps.
---
Not in the slightest. I'd have to disagree. Hunters are extremely mobile. Idk what version you've  been playing buddy. Hunters seem like they belong in titanfall or MVC3!. All hunters have to do is double jump over your head with shotgun n its already over.
---
For real what armor decoration is that? Looks good

For the love of God get out of here with your loot pos.... Oh

All im saying is that people know how OP hunters are. I played 4 matches of comp just now. I ran into 12 hunters.....thats 4 teams of 3 stack hunters....not 1 titan or warlock....why? Because theyreeee great!(tony the tiger voice)
---
I also would like to know this?
---
I’m not sure about console
---
Is it worth it? I haven't plenty of shards but not a lot of space weapon-wise.
---
Up to peoples personal preference. I grew up on the old halo 1 and 2. Everyone starting with the same guns and then controlling the power weapons that are up for everyone is my favorite way to play pvp. But I know that not everyone likes that so eh.
---
Looking for that girl vanguard water I presume
---
I think so, but I’m willing to bet Id be downvoted for it lol
---
A couple exotics
---
Yes
---
Thanks, bro! I just hope we keep playlists like this.
---
Freelance is without fireteams. Only solo queuing. Freelance Survival is 3v3 but it's with all randoms.
---
I lose a 150 points for every loss now - ouch that hurt.
---
nah
---
Just realized that I do have the Catalyst. Probably some drop from PvE or PvP, since I only do those.  
---
I'll work on masterworking it soon!
---
Also looks like a post it note on TV...anyone notice that the 1000 is black not gold
---
Heyyyy good job tho
---
Vex on the field....
---
Yes. It will drop blues for mission completions that'll help you and the red legion campaign will reward 2 or 3 exotics. 
---
Honestly, if you have spare time, go for it. If you are short on time, I would not recommend making time for the rewards.
---
Freelance is a type of solo competitive. It’s still Survival, but you can’t enter as a team so everyone is individually placed on teams (therefore, no one is ever using party chat). You get Glory just like regular Survival, so yes you could get Recluse that way. It’s still comp, so it’s harder as your rank gets higher!
---
Need cursebreaker? No? Then...no lol
---
It'll likely be better to use Mask of the Quiet One in PvE. You get extra energy when you take damage, and if you're a sentinel, that means heals, overshields, and grenades all the time.
---
Go back to the spider, check for another quest to finish of forsaken, then go to the moon and start shadowkeep for Eris

Do the weekly vanguard, crucible, and gambit bounties for bright dust. Each bounty gives 200 bright dust. They’re relatively easy to get done and don’t take a lot of time

Yep solo comp or freelance you can get recluse, revoker, lunas howl and not forgotten.

Gotta grab that catalyst my guy it's noice

Replying in emojis now... You just get dumber by the post.

It is fake..post it note ..destiny displays it's level in gold lettering lol smh
---
Where do I find vanguards, crucible and gambit bounties is there a specific time In need to do them?
---
I'm not sure Gambit is related to "PvP" and I'm not sure it has a SBMM system. 
---
Crucible on the other hand, is run off by elo. Basically, your skill level comparing to others. Who knows, your skill might be really high but doesn't match you with your skill. That's why it's just best to keep playing.
---
Yeah, especially after they added the VTOL mechanic.
---
yeah that just happened to be there from the fighting lion spam LOL

thanks brother, be safe out there
