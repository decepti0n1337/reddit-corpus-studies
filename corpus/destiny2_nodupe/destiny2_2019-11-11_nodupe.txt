One of the bigger complaints I have about this game as a semi-new player. The game doesn't teach you about heroic events what-so-ever. And the in-game community more often than not won't either. I only learned about them from memes like this on reddit. I understand people bitch and moan about reposts but please god believe me when I say that they teach new players, as it's about the ONLY place to learn these things.
---

---
Edit: As a side note, the wiki's for this game are god awful. Somehow less informative than the game itself.
---
but how will the guardians know about i?

Have you tried combining 3 blues at Amanda? Not sure if you could get stuff that doesn't show, or what's all attainable that way. But if you have spare mats just take 3 of the same blue transmat to Amanda and she'll convert them to random legendaries. Could possible include Drop Pod
---
To make what possible?
---
Guardian, reports from Ishtar Sink, Venus?
---
whereisxur.com will be to your help finding him
---
For me my lobbies are usually me crushing people and maybe 1 or 2 decent people on their team if they are lucky
---
It took me six weeks to get one... good luck!
---
Yes they do I did the garden world ordeal strike last week and got the ship (which is the loot for that strike) for two different runs but both were 100k runs getting that score might give you a better drop chance üëçüèæ
---
On pc you can't do a strike solo, unfortunately. Console can change date, but on pc we're stuck with matchmaking
---
That's pretty impressive. Good Work!
---
That would be a signature move if this was breakdancing
---
Just embrace it, don‚Äôt try to linear the entire thing into an order. Total immersion. If it s a blue crown symbol, it‚Äôs part of the campaign you‚Äôre on. If it‚Äôs a red legion mark, it‚Äôs RL legion campaign. Rasputin‚Äôs symbol is warmind campaign. Take it slow,enjoy it.

"Immune" tells you when you cannot damage it. Op is telling you when you CAN damage it.

I think this tip is something most people catch on to eventually but I guarantee 100% of people don't realize it. 
---
A long time ago there was a thread where people were joking about how you check into the flag before a public event and how it doesn't do anything. Some people didn't realize it fills up your ammo, super, etc.
---
Have fun and enjoy prime engrams while you still can. *cries in 950+*
---
I haven't been there yet sir. I will inform you of it's status when I do though.

The worst is if some engrams drop in the "landing" zone. You never know if it's save.

i don‚Äôt even enjoy them now i‚Äôve gotten 3 and they‚Äôve dropped same light level as my other gear

Boi I kept getting ass raped by shoulder strike and you can‚Äôt do anything about it. Literally no way to counter something that 1 shots you from a great range
---
I use targeting adjuster
---
Yes. There is fusion rifles and linear fusion rifles. I believe the linears are in the power slot and fusion rifles is in the energy slot
---
Beautiful. Here‚Äôs an Orange arrow.

BOI I kept ass raping with arc battery dodges with wormhusk. Every class has its own aids.

Bungie hasn't finished things connected to the armour 2.0 system. So Xur is pulling from Collections for everything. So is menagerie. And collections seems to have been rushed and is still a work in progress
---
Why are you only using grenade launcher in the heavy slot? There are other options, like Fighting Lion, or Orewing's Maul, so ammo wouldn't be as much of a struggle.
---
They drain like hell
---
Dunno how you come to that realization. Ive always done best as warlock, from day 1 D1 to now.
---
Usually gives a kill tracker too.

Idk I‚Äôm just out here tryina get the huckleberry catalyst as well lmao

But imagine if instead of logging onto YouTube and watching hours upon hours of videos, hear me out, I could just understand the lore by playing the game.
---
That‚Äôs crazy I get Lincoln‚Äôs green all the time

You can do 2 per character each week.
---
Interesting..
---
Your constant excuse for being bad is "iT dRaiNs tOo MuCh" when supers 90% of the time 1 shot so that just tells me you dont know how to lead your shots or your just bad at aiming.

That's such a great idea

Probably just cuz its swollen rn
---
The biggest oof is trying to get mida catalyst
---
I know how to do the primary slot. Do the rose quest, on the stage it becomes the lumina. If you still have rose equipped and you have an exotic in any other slot. It can't allow two exotics so it unequips rose and leaves the slot empty.
---
I think you can also do it for the legend of acrius shotgun in heavy but I'm not sure about that.

Where do you get this

---
Dude the fact that you couldn't argue any ability that can counter and your only actual counter was to limit one of the other classes weapon slots to deal with it shows that you had no real arguement.
---
I will say that maybe it is my play style that causes me to get hit more often than you do but it's genuinely an issue that one out of 3 classes has a OHKO on all 3 subclasses.
---
This one ability cuts down the maneuverability and versatility of the other two classes.
---
You play Titan so just watch as you play how many times you shoulder charge someone vs how often someone gets killes by a charged grenade or a hunters poison smoke, there are no direct abilitys that counter or produce the same results.
---
What exactly is meant by ‚Äúmassive damage phase‚Äù? Do you mean a long damage phase similar to that Golgoroth in D1?
---
If you love bows in PvP, and will be using Oathbreaker anyway, its awesome.
---
I don‚Äôt get why everyone complains about OEM. I rarely see it used and I feel like skullfort is way stronger. Infinite exploding shoulder charges that regenerate my health
---
Thank youuuu
---
Again like I have already said its not because I can't win its because it not fun to play against at all. Saying play something else is a childish excuse for being a bad sport.
---
Never played D1 so idk what that is.  Long phase yes cause it takes a long time to charge but the damage output is good.
---
Doing this made me hate trying to use scout rifles in crucible. Everything else was nicer in comparison imo.
---
Only in the rare chance you can get a dust bundle to drop. I‚Äôm at rank 175 and only received one 200 bright dust drop from an engram. That‚Äôs 1 out of 15 nostalgic engram drops. They just need to give us more options in earning bright dust  those +10 BD bounties are a joke.

dont sort by new

Yeah I did it too, but it's not armor 2.0 so old mods only.

Toronto would be amazing... was there years ago but now I‚Äôm thinking of the last bit of humanity hiding in the PATH system... all that underground and all those buildings.

Congratulations üéä and welcome to the club and same gambit Was definitely not my favourite activity to have to do üòä
---
That perk makes it the only usable secondary grenade launcher, for me at least
---
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
Congratulations üéä you will love the weapons my favourite out of them is not forgoten and followed by Randy's throwing knife
---
Link to blank version?
---
The campaign gives you two exotics, a weapon and an armor piece. Random exotics like this one are much more rare.
---
Warlocks are the nerds and bookworms and love to sit in rifts and do nothing but wait to shoot things. Hunters are the class clown and loves to bunnyhop in the air with shotguns saying its skill. Titans are the dumb muscle head who loves to punch things.
---
Fair enough.
---
I actually made a friend in it today!! He decided to help me do the 900 lvl Arms Dealer strike so I could get Leviathans Breath Bow. I‚Äôve been struggling on it for a while and we beat it first try with a random 3rd. I was so happy to get that quest done after starting from scratch not playing destiny 2 since it originally launched on Xbox.

yep, RIP my favorite fun solo PvE class.   Anyone actually good at the game was crippling themselves by using bottom tree striker in PvP anyhow.
---
Ballistic logs. Since then it appears you can only do one a day, once you do one it turns from a gold frame to a silver one. All other frames I've tested work on the first go. The only one that hasn't worked is the bow.
---
what platform
---
Look I'm not saying anything stupid like that. But what if instead of nerfing everything, we just buff everything else into par.? Like for example, what if hunter throwing knives could one hit k.o upon crit? Or what if solar grenades did more damage and could one hit? See what I mean?
---
Stay in Guardian 2
---
Yeah man iron banner has been good to me post match with the exotics
---
On adept yeah
---
Saved the best for last. Thanks brother. Happy to finally get the hunter off my desktop.
---
Throwing knives used to be so good in D1 i loved playing Gunslinger in pvp now both just arent worth it.
---
Issue we have with buffing everything is a game where you instantly die isn't fun either and if we have ranged OHKO abilities it'll flip where Titans are at a disadvantage which again wouldnt be fair.
---
You earned a subscribble my guy. It's refreshing to see actual creative content on this sub.
---
*just got my fierst exotic guyis (insert picture of TV taken on phone)*
---
That's how I got mine done last night. Found a group that was on the boss. Took about 15 minutes give or take but I got and I love it. Hope you get it too.
---
Our ghost is kind of a little bitch
---
I don't think adept has a chance at exotic gear if I recall hero exotics are uncommon. If they do drop it's just a world drop then iirc
---
Nice collat.

I'm not being toxic at all, I'm just pointing out how people keep saying the same thing to seem cool
---
Hazbin Hotel is slowly taking over the meme community...
---
...Good.
---
 /shrug lol
---
I disagree with that idea, if you sit back only to deal with the OEM titan than you can be EASLY picked off the the rest of the titans team
---
Anarchy, 1k, and tarrabah are all random drops from raids. The rest
---
If I had a dollar for every post complaining about titans in pvp I‚Äôd be rich asf
---
They picked wisely
---
I think PvP is in a good place relative to how it used to be BUTT, it's not in a good place if we look at it's current iteration on its own. They really need to balance abilities and Supers more than anything in my opinion. There is no balance at the moment. Weapons feel fine besides a few outliers. Things like Jotunn, Erentil, Sniper flinch need to be changed. ( I think there should be more flinch. As someone who Snipes more than anything, it's way too easy to headshot people while being shot ).
---
Lol how did it go
---
It's actually a mirror image of OEM
---
Just google one eyed mask. Its one of the first pictures that come up.
---
Hey shut the fuck up. No one gives a shit you‚Äôre so self righteous. Epic noob
---
I felt so lucky getting that rocket launcher. Got it on my 2nd run of VoG from that exotic chest. First run handed me a hawkmoon
---
At least you can grind for izanagi, though. A ton of people didn't even get their first gjallarhorn until xur sold it his 2nd time
---
Yeah and everyone uses OEM because they think it's cool. Your point? However, I'd argue it's better to be a "hipster" and use random things because they're fun, than use the same loadout every time you play the game and just melt everything. Games are fun because they're challenging and using the most broken overpowered stuff completely destroys that. If you really have to win to have fun you're missing out.
---
So Fallen and the Grineer share a design philosophy.  Grineer Thumpers on Warframe share a similar trait, even down to the damage vents being on the knee plates.
---
ops ;-;
---
Don't like eriana's vow? Can run it with the vow to be a very vowy boi.

Also, f*ck groundstomps

At least you can grind for izanagi and wendigo. A huge population of d1 raiders outright couldn't get gjallarhorn because they kept getting fucked over by rng

We want to help you, Princes. We offer to each of you a bargain... a symbiosis.

The special strike Arms Dealer generally requires at least one other person, same way that the corrupted strike mission for malfeasance requires at least another person. light level doesn‚Äôt always matter, same way that raids bump ur LL down to 750 in last wish.

Idk why but that‚Äôs the way it is :) soloing is always possible just a lot more difficult

They have FUN builds, but not TOP TIER builds, or even builds who comes anywhere close to what is optimal in the two other classes. Hell, the wormhusk/arc battery build is considered the current best PvP build for hunter, and it barely gives you 1 to 2 bullets worth more of survivability for a split second, without anything else, something that most Titans have for, well, simply existing . Hunters have the worst melees, the worst class ability, the slowest and least lethal supers (except blade barrage, who's tree is entirely made for PVE either way) and grenades who are only decent when spammed, which is barely achievable in PvP compaired to PvE. The only usable things for hunters in PvP in their trees are almost entirely utility options with varying amounts of very niche applications to them. The whole class just feels like its entirely geared for PvE, yet most builds will end up being underpowered compaired to warlocks and titans... The only time a hunter will be more efficient at ANYTHING compaired to other clases,  is in SOLO scenarios.
---
GL control.
---
Ok ty :)
---
my exact first thoughts.
---
oh no
---
Or, how about we make the one hunter ability that takes 20 times the effort to use than handheld supernova and ahoulder charges but might as well be an arc fart, into an ohk ability too? Yes folks Im talking about the slide melee charge of mid tree strider. You have to sprint for somewhat of a decent time (if you try to slide after one step it likely wont proc), you have to slide and then melee, which throws a SLOW af bolt of arc forward, but eait, it takes you into third person so unless you play it extremely right you get shot out of the air before you even land.
---
Its an awesome juking ability, and dont get me wrong Ive done some insane plays with it, but often times it puts you into too much of a vulnerable position compared to how much rewards it brings.
---
Meanwhile locks just hold their grenade and it destroys everyone, titans just need to run and melee and unless you have a shotgun theyre gonna get away with being apes. (Aka to defeat the apes you have to be one too). Also lets not even mention throwing knives barely tickling enemies even at precision shots. Bungie needs to realize that there's either no place for ohk abilities for either of the classes, or they need to level the playing field.
---
dirtyderson you are a shyly embarrassing grump!
---
29 days left in the season.  Plenty of time!
---
Outside of Arc Battery, what needs to be nerfed for Hunters?
---
Yes , you can also add One Two Punch in there aswell
---
Didn‚Äôt know that.
---
Makes sense.
---
I just rolled a trench barrel Imperial Decree, so probably gonna go for the opposite combo. ty for the tip tho
---
Try using different weapons like crimson or suros regime. Both guns that are pains to fight against because they shred and also have healing perks. Also, just be that one guy who does all the campy meta things, recluse grind eliminates all morale compasses within a 5 mile range.
---
It was, it can get shut down pretty ok rn. Probably hunters that keep complaining on titans to keep attention away from their wormhusk-arc battery dodge.
---
Noice!!
---
Ive said it to others you are compairing it to one ability on one Subclass branch where as Totan has this option on all except one of its builds.
---
Compair this to the Hunter who has no OHKO abilities.
---
Moving back you will often get stuck on geometry and jumping is a death sentence if there are other Gardians around.
---
The ones who run in straight lines are mot really the issue its the ones that know to run cover to cover i honestly think setting it so that they loose turning ability would go a large way to fixing it.
---
You are not worthy
---
Have you tried looking very carefully at Ada-1? She has a second page. On that second page is a consumable that makes armor drop! 
---
The only way to get armor is the 2 weekly bounties and the consumable (which says how it works when you hover over it). It never randomly drops.

There is no account merging, or way to combine anything from two separate accounts. There is only cross save, where you use one account on multiple platforms.
---
Jesus, this is a cringefest. You should read/reply to the other (more helpful) replies.
---
WTF!?!?
---
Yeah I can‚Äôt get polymer because I need one more schematic but I can‚Äôt get schematics unless I get gear so I‚Äôm stucküò¢üòÇ
---
Load into a strike that starts in the open zone and go farm a lost sector. The kills count as if during a strike. Such strikes are : lake of Shadows in the edz, the corrupted DC, mars ones etc.
---
You cant? If ita the same account, linked with cross save, then its automatically there, but if its two seperate accounts, then you cant transfer any gear. 
---
And just for clarificatuion, if you enable cross save, then youll be only able to keep one account, either PC or PS4, the other will be "overwritten"
---
There's a YT video someone made showing HC ranges don't really mean much anymore. From the lowest range (a blue) to the highest (ace/crimson iirc) the difference was like 25m to 28m for damage falloff.
---
This might be a little lower if it was real, but even then prob not by much.
---
Warlock is just harder to pull off. I play a mean warlock, i am disappointed i see so little blink warlocks as it can really help in pvp.
---
one thing to keep in mind is that you can not roll Multi Kill Clip in the random rolled , however you can roll something that's somewhat better ie Outlaw/Kill Clip
---
Yea, i keep hitting 5k , just to go back down to 3.5k. Ive literally turned in 3000 crucible tokens this season, im not sure how much you get per game, but im pretty sure ive played A LOT
---
Little
---
Bitch
---
&gt;but I can‚Äôt get schematics unless I get gear
---
That is not how it works at all. You get schematics from dismantling BA guns.
---
I suspect there's not much money to be had in returning to old content when there are new mechanics and exotics and cheeses to reveal.  I do wish they'd give old content a new look from time to time, though.

If you care about the score, then yes.

My fireteam and I, we've been playing every 3 man activity together since Forsaken, each of us has catalysted Izanagi and we don't ever use it outside of 6 man activities, lol. Not even when we're doing our 980s. Izanagi seems to have a gigantic circlejerk going on.
---
Yes.
---
What weapon is this?
---
Im gonna be straight honest with you, you handled this better than I would have. Nice going man
---
There is the ranked playlist, where you need to win to advance and defeats loose you points.
---
Overshield lasts for 1sec, only gives a bit of health, have to use a CD and spec for it. 
---
Compared to OEM giving one of the strongest overshield in the game that lasts for several seconds, on top of tracking and a damage buff, requiring no CD and can be used with any spec. 
---
If you don‚Äôt see the difference...
---
Didn't they just need bottom tree?

Naah, fixing servers costs money, they'll keep the trash servers from the past century until Destiny 3.

I finished that just in the beginning of leviathan, was too easy.

first you need to max out your valour rank sixty times in one season, then you need to get to 10K glory and achieve the In pursuit of the stuff of myth triumph (775 kills with a sidearm, 250 seventh column medals, and 75 midair headshot sniper rifle noscopes) then you have to get 100 kills (in crucible) with every crucible pinnacle in the game, after that you can get a shitty version of the weapon called minor fucking issue, 5K kills with that and the weapon is yours! (after soloing a 250 handicap nightfall with a score over 250K in less than 15 minutes)
---
Aren‚Äôt Warlocks supposed to be the smartest?

But honestly, who would waste their exotic slot on a heavy? :')

They introduced a new progression blocking bug though.
---
The only issue I have with titan is shoulder charge. I've had so many games with titans running round like they're on an American Football or Rugby field and just shoulders charge everyone. Damn it's so annoying. That and recluse is still a pain, but oh well.
---
I think the quest you have is either for the Exotic shotgun called Acrius (Vanilla D2/Leviathan Raid shotty) or Leviathans Breath. For Acrius there is a part of the quest where you have to do the Arms Dealer strike and it was fairly difficult back in the day, almost nightfall-like. Bungie has changed it around to where you do not have to shoot hidden objects in order to add time back because at 1 point, if you ran out of time, it booted you back to orbit and you had to try again on top of the added difficulty. Thats been changed and its no longer part of the strike, but the strike itself is still a higher level. Kind of like the corrupted Strike for the hand cannon.
---
What kinda shitty people have been in your clans?
---
It's Blast Furnace with Obsidian Radiance on it.
---
I‚Äôm sure i saw it for sale. It might not be anymore but check eververse
---
Oh the range just bothered me when I was using it
---
Im available. As am new ive done this way too many times
---
Yeah it was kind-off expensive, lived one week without glimmer at all :D
---
About planetary mats, season rank-ups and some planetary daily bounties are enough to get it.
---
But i dont know if im going to get catalyst now, as it requiers 40 tributes, maybe after I will hit 80% discount
---
Thanks ok, thanks!

\&gt;Now enemies spawn behind me
---
This happened to my IB matches yesterday. A hunter jumping on me from behind out of nowhere...so frustrating...more than shoulder charging
---
As if there's no enhanced Hands on mod
---
Too fuckin true
---
nah at 4500+ all I see are hunters on PC, only time I see a titan is when they're using OEM.
---
Cat.
---
Ohoh!
---
I just looked up eris morn fireteam and scrolled until i found a picture. It probably isn‚Äôt official, I just needed a pic for the joke.
---
It's a random drop like most exotics are, so your best bet if you dont normally play titan, is to wait and see if you can get it from xur. Bear in mind theres a nerf incoming, so it's probably not worth farming heavily now.
---
I'll the some of that truth
---
Nope i can use all the mods hat are unlocked
---
Make it work like public events, have a flag to rally to before the match starts and any guardians who walks through the area while the match is going on will ghost, so they won't be shot in the crossfire.
---
No, the lesson is to use a search engine before posting on reddit. Most of this has already been posted before and is easily accessible.
---
The only real issue I see is the combination of these 4.  In a vacuum each one is great, but OEM striker titans seem to benefit the most from the what I call the ‚Äúrecluse/mountaintop mouthbreather build.‚Äù  This particular class/exotic combination elevates shitty players to higher tiers through absolutely brain dead play because it has such high forgiveness for mistakes and has a built in get out of jail free card, while circumventing mechanics designed to keep players rooted on the ground in order to accurately fire their weapons.
---
OEM is predicated on winning your 1v1 in order to get that damage buff/shield.  Mountaintop allows you to instantly win that 1v1 by merit of just flying above and (because it has near perfect hip fire aerial accuracy) shooting the floor near targets instead of, you know, actually having to aim a weapon and skillfully shoot your enemy. (Didnt kill on the first shot? No bother just switch to recluse and tap them with two bullets to get the buff) Now you have a damage buff and a shield and you get to freely delete the rest of the other team with both, while refreshing the damage buff with each kill.
---
Simply put, OEM was not designed with this specific synergy in mind and it has the ability to just ruin any and all crucible games.
---
Make OEM shield/buff proc only off of bullet weapon kills, keep the tracking, but force people to win their gunfights instead of cheesing ways around that stipulation with mountaintop.
---
____________________
---
As for recluse, it has its own problems that are abused by every class, and it actually seems like it‚Äôs worse in the new sandbox even with the MOA nerf simply because it has much greater range.  At this point I think they just need to scrap the idea of MOA altogether or at least neuter it so badly that it‚Äôs extremely situational if they want to save the crucible.  
---
For 1, it shouldn‚Äôt buffer MOA when you kill with another gun, that 4 second timer needs to start immediately, even while the other gun is out.  
---
2, make it headshot dependent for the damage bonus.  Keep the handling and swap speed the same as it is.  All the damage buff in the world doesn‚Äôt mean shit if you have potato aim and can‚Äôt actually use it.
---
3, no refreshing MOA on kill.
---
If what I described sounds suspiciously like neutering your precious pinnacle weapon that you worked so hard for then good, it‚Äôs exactly what it is. Pinnacles were a fun idea but have proven to be far too powerful in comparison to literally every other legendary to the point that it actively destroys the weapon itemization and chase in the game.  Why would I use literally any other energy SMG (hell, literally any other energy weapon exotics included) when I have recluse? Why would I use literally any other fusion rifle in PVE when loaded question exists? Revoker is basically icebreaker‚Äôs annoying cousin. Delirium is the best MG by a country mile in literally any situation barring the curated hammerhead gambit.
---
I can vouch for this. Am titan. Did this.
---
I couldn't really be as half as hpeful as you when my friend died. Hope you make it faster trough the sad-phase and will remember her forever.  
---

never forget persons you love and remmember them in honor. She is probably in a wonderful place, waiting till you one day, in a long time, you join her fireteam on the other side.

But which throwing knife kill?
---
That parallax on the character menu is monstrous, is there the option to set it?
---
Dont worry about you'll get the hang of destiny soon enough
---
Nice, I just got mine Saturday night.
---
It's been a problem for a while, but I did try to log out an in. Sadly nothing happend
---
Dang stroking your cock in front of Mara Sov's room talk about a mad lad
---
Seems pretty obvious to me.
---
Hi I'm going to address all counterarguments in this thread all at once
---
&gt; Titan isn't OP because it's not used in high elo!
---
Hi welcome to the most base level balancing argument to ever exist. So WHAT if something isn't a problem for the top 10% of the population? The 10% not having a problem doesn't mean the 90% magically also doesn't have that problem.
---
&gt; Titan isn't OP because Hunter has arc battery
---
So? What if someone isn't using arc battery? We're not bots who do nothing but play the easiest, most successful strategies (Unless you use OEM). Destiny likes to try and give people a sense of variety, and what variety is there if you NEED to run a certain build because every other build is so pathetic in comparison? Just because strategies exist that can counter the OP strategy doesn't mean the OP strategy isn't OP. **Necessitating** a counter by default makes something OP.
---
&gt; Titan isn't OP, just get better
---
And what if I do? Sure, I don't have the problem anymore, but that's just offloading the problem onto newer or worse players. Just because I can personally overcome an OP strategy doesn't mean it's not broken. I care about people that aren't me.
---
&gt; Titan isn't OP, just use X/Y/Z
---
Again, having a counter doesn't make a strategy not OP. It inhibits variety by forcing you to use X/Y/Z in order to have a fighting chance.
---
&gt; Titan isn't OP because there are more hunters at higher ELO!
---
Well, that isn't because titan is weak, it's just because hunter players are better at the game.
---
(/s, obviously)
---
What's the Nerf gun's real name?
---
Literally one of the top 3 best feelings i've ever had in this game. Getting this one took way too long.
---
Happened like five games in a row during mayhem for me. Love it.
---
Meanwhile, Warlock gets nothing remotely interesting that helps it at all.
---
Lol!
---
No, that one you have to buy. You can get others from the forest though.
---
It needs sniper scope amd minigun barrels like sweet bussiness have
---
Now I can one shot the ender dragon
---
*IF I HAD IZANAGI‚ÄôS BURDEN*
---
It's a high render from a dev's ArtStation, I believe. This image (with a gray background) is one of the first images you get when googling One-Eyed Mask
---
Meh auto correct likes to fuck my spelling ;-;
---
You guys are such fucking babies. I main Hunter and slaughter OEMs all day. Playing my Titan for IB pinnacle gear is boring.
---
As I have failed to see a decent explanation even though there are quite a few comments already....  
---
Forges are now accessed via a node on the EDZ destinations map around bottom left from memory, the forge that is available is on a daily rotation so you cannot pick which forge you will be doing.  All weapon frames can be crafted at all forges now so no more needing to do bergusia for any frame or the specific forge for a particular weapon (volundr for hammerhead as example).     
---
Am not sure about the forge specific shaders, you used to need to craft a forge specific weapon at that particular forge to get a chance for the shader to drop on a weapon or bit of armor.  This could potentially be any weapon on any forge for the forge specific shader, someone else would need to clarify that.
---
They do, just not that one.
---
cracked up at feeding frenzy or outlaw haha
---
Nice :D Got my Monte Carlo yesterday in Iron Banner. Realised it by accident tho xP
---
Is this supposed to be a joke? Don't joke about that stuff. And if it aint a joke, chill out. Nobody needs to be reported here. Just calm down.
---
Yes but it is more fun then the first
---
...Why do bubbleTitans like to paint "FREE KILL?" on themselves?
---
Signed, a Peregrine Greaves user
---
ikr its so annoying tho some of ur pinnacle quests do carry over
---
THROW MORE GRENADES
---
If that was me I would add you as friend just to congratulate you and promise you im uninstalling
---
Been playing since D1 day one and had no idea. I just shoot a couple times occasionally until it stops saying immune
---
Try deleting them and then re installing through the games extra ‚Äú ready to install‚Äù
---
Now try to hit legend using exclusively mid tree striker, I guarantee you after that you won‚Äôt rage at this game ever again.
---
"...the Light always finds it's way."
---
# F
---
Its fine. Stop complaining and keep using your grenade launcher.
---
If the quest is account wide it should say, others wise have fun.
---
Meme is good, on the other hand, i think the money from players who buy forsaken/shadowkeep after trying out the game, will be huge.
---
Im new light f2p, played like 180h, and im thinking about buying both expansion, because this game CAN keep me entartained for a long time. I had a blast.
---
So i think the servers will improve by time.
---
200iq play!
---
Complete encounter at the Blind Well, at any of the Black Armory forget, or in Escalation Protocol.
---
What shader is that?
---
New age black armoury
---
People who think you *need* Izanagi's Burden to clear this raid are brainlets. There are plenty of weapons that can to DPS. Whisper, Wendigo (or any GL with spikes, preferably auto-loading), and DARCI. I have taken plenty of people through who do not have Izanagi's just fine.
---
give us shaders on exotics first
---
Bungie is a fickle mistress...

It‚Äôs easy as hell to get kills as a striker Titan.  Maybe you‚Äôre just bad.  I only have a 1.5kd and I can get kills extremely easily as a striker Titan, so...you‚Äôre doing it wrong.
---
It just feels so barren looking at my quest log...I couldn't do it :(
---
#MENACING
---
MY BUILD ALLOWS ME TO DO THAT!!
---
Thanks! Congrats to you too. Yeah, Mountaintop is awesome, almost a little too awesome. I‚Äôm in the same boat with Randy‚Äôs, I‚Äôm at like 68% on mine, might try to finish it out tonight. I‚Äôve been cycling through that and my revoker pursuit and broadsword... too many crucible pursuits in my inventory. I hope momentum control just stays around, I like playing it without the grind. Though the meta is ridiculous, as you said l, jade rabbits and fighting lions everywhere. When I‚Äôm killed  by a recluse or anything else really it‚Äôs kind of refreshing lol
---
the engram doesn't give everything from Y2, you can check what's available in the engram, anything not shown is unattainable
---
What's the second gun in the pic? I know the first one is the recluse
---
Rat King+Subtle Calamity. Beast combo in crucible and currently pushing 2000 pvp kills
---
Okay thanks. I die from it a lot.
---
I don't want to sound callused, but there is an eternity with Jesus Christ. And I pray that you both know not just of him, but actually know that he died for our sins so that we will have an eternal life beyond this one. 
---
 God bless you both üíù
---
but hey at least u main hunter, *cries in titan*
---
Looks like bloody tooth
---
&gt;Cayde brought me up here once. We looked at all the cars, all the people who died, tryin' to get the safety, during the Collapse
---
This one got me. Damn.
---
Okay we failed this encounter, wipe guys.
---
This last patch was supposed to address this and literally made no difference
---
I think Destiny is better off without autoloading stuff to be honest. 
---
Nice birb.
---
'93, damn
---
Thanks!
---
Is that why you reposted this?
---
If this was an implemented concept, would the arrow have any weight to it that would cause extreme falloff at a certain range?
---
So why would there be a bounty if you can't access that forge?  Or is the intent that you hold onto the bounty until that forg is in the daily rotation?
---
I know, using 2 old names to make a new one.
---
Some people think is a dark souls reference
---
oh ive been there SINCE Friday, friday from 7pm to 7am i left came back next day at 5pm went to bed at 1 am sunday, same thing on sunday untill 11:30 pm i quit coz i need to work next day, still didnt get it, lots of disappointment feels bad man, at least you got it but hey those friends are stupid sorry to say that LUL
---
Caluses selected is what I use. It's white and gold and some guns it will add a couple purple accents as well. Looks really good on Randy's throwing knife and the new season pass cosmetic armor.
---
LOL I actually took my helmet off the other because I was thinking this might be an issue. Thanks for the confirmation haha
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone has ever said that because literally everyone uses it
---
Forgot about that one! Haven't seen it that much tho (on console). 
---
Seems like everyone forgot about the 'middle tree tether thing swipe all around the map in stealth with wallhacks, extreme damage resist and huge aoe swipe' super back in the time
---
That's not what genocide is
---
Took us 6 and a half hours to get it done + it was all of ours first run
---
I just wanna know what that armor set was
---
Lol deserved....you were wasting it anyway.
---
Hard Light is pretty sweet
---
That upsets me so much. I spent weeks trying to get a rare bounty, and the one time I do is the week the quest is bugged and it didn't give me credit. Much upset
---
Well personally it didn't bother me, I've always imagined my Guardian always being more of a gruff hardass, more so then Zavala. Where Zavala is a hard ass in that EVERYTHING is by the book. My Guardian would be a hardass with the no fooling around (Unless Cayde was involved, then its time for a joke or two) and shoot first ask later. Always gets the job done, even if a few glasses have to be smashed and doesn't worry about any morel implications.
---
Kinda wish Bungie would allow us to well, make our Guardian stand out a little bit more like giving use some choices. The Choice on helping the drifter was cool but well there really hasn't been any consequences for it so far.
---
Thank the traveler you did us all the favor of taking the spot of least original, somebody ‚Äúhad‚Äù to do it and we‚Äôre so fortunate it was you /s
---
i am never that mindless. and i play striker a good bit. it has such good neutral game. i also hardly ever use the smash that much.
---
God forbid the worst hc archetype in the game 2 tap you. Rapid fire weapons gaining 1-2 damage per shot is a much better example of why the damage buff isn't okay.
---
Every class is great
---
Exactly my point, rocket striker is the best striker
---
I did the quest about a week ago. Used the Forge key on the box but nothing happen except loosing the key. I have no idea how to require another key.
---
Yeah, I started Friday and PvP'd all the way to 912.
---
Feels kinda bad because I feel like I'm not playing 99% of the game. It's also hard for me as a new player to tell what are worthless activities versus important activities versus mandatory activities. Altogether, it's hard to prioritize my time and my quest log is constantly full. I don't know what I should be doing that are on daily or weekly timers that I'm missing out on for 900-950 gear. I did some research to find list of activities for 900-950, but it's overwhelming. Lots of the list is stuff I've never heard of or don't know how to start, so even starting some of them requires even more research. And then there's things that I don't know if they're a waste of time due to difficulty. For example, Haunted Forest level 9 for a Pinnacle item, but the highest I've gotten is 8 with the average being level 5. So theoretically I could queue for that 10 more times, never beat level 9, and waste hours.
---
literally every solar super for titan is super good. i have yet to find a better super shutdown than burning maul.since every hammer smash can basically one hit a super. dawnblade scares me though it scares me....
---
You can use it in getting the catalyst for bad juju
---
Yes the quest is fixed. I got the gun a few days ago
---
Some people have forgotten what it‚Äôs like to have fun and it‚Äôs sad that winning has become everything because of that
---
every subclass has different roles, they all rly good in different situation, so no such thing as overrated, and not like titan has many viable option for pve
---
what about middle hammers? they are very fun
---
Congrats buddy! Enjoy it
---
Try Mayhem when it comes around again. Very easy to get that voiceline there.
---
What do you mean "buy the event"?
---
I am also new and 912 power level.
---
Yep and all our search engines return those early ones with more views even if somebody makes a new one.
---
Zavala blowing fatty clouds from that mod he has
---
Just heard about this because of someone trying to steal the post for their own. üò¢
---
It's probably been said but as the Lunas/Not Forgotten lore goes:
---
"Guardians never die. But we don't forget those who do." ‚ÄîLord Shaxx
---
Ok well I guess the mobility thing isnt too bad of a nerf, if anything it's more of a balance than a nerf, as a titan main I'd be okay with that, as long as they dont nerf it to where it's back to year 1 when shoulder charge didnt one hit k.o, and well as for hunters not to feel screwed over anymore, they should make throwing knives one hit k.o upon crit, u know?
---
Living that vape lyf #spacevapenation

This is gold.

You gotta speed it up ...... like a lot lol your a guardian why are your feet on the floor lol
---
Do you happen to remember what weapon he was using
---
Now this might be scarier than ShadowKeep üëÄ
---
No.
---
Ugh, I feel your pain. I haven't been able to do the strike for lack of help. -.-'
---
Shout out to the absolute legend who bestowed on me silver. Let his Recluse‚Äôs barrel run hot and his Izanagi‚Äôs Burden aim true.
---
I get why they had to remove the OHKO on the throwing knives back when you got a Crit and the burn guaranteed the kill, but we need something to be properly competitive, i would have liked spectral blades to have a Sholder charge like ability honestly it would have rounded things out nicely.
---
I really hope thats ur pvp set
---
yo what if they made shadowkeep free because yea
---
awesome makes sense
---
Not sure if you‚Äôre on PC/console, but there are scrims that people run with their own set of rules. Not a part of them, but you can probably check around r/crucibleplaybook for more.
---
It was teams
---
They try to put you as far from a majority of the enemy team as possible, but all it takes is one enemy to be on the other side alone and you're spawned right in front of them.
---
I'd much rather just spawn closest to a majority of my team honestly. At least then someone else is already probably engaging any enemies in the area.
---
Double on weekdays, triple on weekends
---
yep the quest went to my post master! thanks

Taken Knights and minotaurs teleport too, but at least they don't blind you with their bullshit ball.

But I speedily grenade myself?!

Fuck yeah, nacho man

dude im jusk askin calm down
---
The stuff you craft at the altar has got that a e s t h e t i q u e tho
---
Bungie has heard your complaint and has removed the Hammerhead from the game.
---
Thanks to the absolute legend who bestowed me silver. He is the real MVP.
---
People still get disconnected. Solo pit runs were a f\*cking nightmare because of this and that one insta-kill bug in between sections...not counting every other activity that you dont get compensation for getting booted out of
---
Yes. I only play solo
---
Why are people upvoting this asshole that stole someone else‚Äôs post down to the exact words used in the title?
---
Im sorry but sniping is pretty easy my best games are when i use a sniper i feel like a coward in the back of the map its hard to miss in this game with instant bullets and insane aim assist plus your are usually so far that you are not really in danger its still a one shot kill which takes no skill, hell i have run sniper/bow and wrecked in those games there are even some low zoom snipers that are good at medium range and all you need to do is scope in and shoot while the other guy needs 2-3 trigger pulls to kill you he usually wont get the second shot of because you get a free one shot kill its dumb, having to track your target and hit more than one shot takes more skill than any one shot kill
---
You can do two per week. Reset is Tuesday morning.
---
I didn't see the text
---
Ace of Spades mostly. All his kills were precision shots. We actually crouched behind a corner and waited to see what would happen, he knew exactly where we were, thew a nade and 3 headshots
---
That‚Äôs great!! So that also means that I can the season pass armor for my hunger?
---
Yea, I believe it's the only way to get it too, it was the only reason why I kept buying his engrams.
---
And I know it's not great stat wise, it's basically an Austringer with less aim assist, no mods or random rolls.
---
But I really like the model and the feel of it, or one could keep it as a collector's thing
---
It has to be within 10sec of them invading + before they kill someone = "Not On My Watch" medal
---
Dude people ask for 960+ players for god damn zero hour now lol
---
Scrape up 30$, problem solved
---
is only paid game why heff to be mad
---
Quick context i know its toxic but i was finaly on my last triple kill to get my mountain top. Then this happend
---
I wanted that final blow, it would be mine
---
Why do you say this
---
Yep, it does. In ESO, I once had a 7 hr clear with my raid team when we first started out. 6 months later, we were running that same one flawless in 17 minutes. Running top 5 in NA. That was a good feeling, but damn there's a lot of pain getting there.
---
Lol
---
Cerberus is amazing in Iron Banner.
---
i read this in shaxx's voice
---
I read that in shaxx's voice

Why tf you posting this on D2 Reddit? It depends on what sort of aim assist you‚Äôre talking about and what engine it‚Äôs using. 
---
Judging by your post you‚Äôll likely find it too difficult and inevitably give up on trying to learn. 
---
Personally I‚Äôd recommend learning programming languages and functionalities before trying to ‚Äòprogram games‚Äô. You‚Äôd actually have a clue as to what you‚Äôre doing that way.
---
Forsaken is not free
---
Sunblyat
---
All of those are banned in tourneys but ggs to the other team in quickplay and comp I still prefer my not forgotten and imperial decree with Darci and synthoceps
---
Outrageous fortune with spikes.
---
Dank.
---
Do you PvP?
---
Me dumb. Me no skill. There I corrected it. Only joking.
---
The guys getting 200 a win aren‚Äôt at the glory level the game wants them to be at based on there skill so it‚Äôs basically put them on a fast track to get there. You seem to be at or near the glory the game thinks you‚Äôre at skill-wise.
---
You still need to buy forsaken. But when you do just go to the Tangled Shore under your destinations tab (it'll be farthest to the right towards the bottom corner). When you open the Tangled Shore map it'll give you options to fast travel and you need to look at the bottom on the map for the forsaken symbol. If you click on that then it'll be the start for the first mission
---
Yes. That‚Äôs what I built this for.
---
Can I repost this again next week please?
---
Most recent one I've been able to find is from about 8 months ago (and it's dialed in a bit for Prestige).  I'm taking for granted that most of the gear I'll be using is gear that didn't exist the first time around, as I'll probably run Well of Radiance for the most part.  Here's to hoping I get a couple of useful new drops or catalysts completed before we start this weekend!
---
Oh. We assumed they'd go with the "make people buy the most recent content as the rest isn't relevant anymore anyways" approach...
---
Thanks a lot.
---
Lol I have had an legend of acrius stuck in my hunters inventory for two years because of that...have no plans to raid lol. Mistakes were made, wouldn't have grabbed the quest in the first place
---
Totally balanced.
---
Everything is fine.
---
ERR: you must have this many pixels to meme
---
Agreed. My buddy is a Lock and I‚Äôm a hunter and he keeps saying we need exotics like that and I honestly would rather not have them and do without, the game would be so much more fun without a OEM or hunter/lock exotic equivalent.
---
*inhales* BLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYTTTTTR
---
I feel like I'm more likely to get armor when I turn in iron banner tokens. But winning an iron banner match seems to drop the IB weapons for me pretty often
---
This 100%. Learn a language before you actually try to work on games. It'll make it a lot easier when you actually get to that point.

The emblem for this book wasn't all that great.

---
Accurate observation
---
What have you done
---
Scouts or snipers go for long range scouts though. Takes 3 shots on those and 1 on sniper, then make sure to save ammo.
---
Eh. No that‚Äôs fair. Not to say I have no skill but this clip absolutely required no skill. üòÇ
---
I've had that happen just last night. I saw a brief blip of red on my radar a few seconds after I respawned.  I chuckled to myself, went invisible, pulled out my Erentil and went to go surprise this solo flanker. Only I wasn't paying attention to the kill tracker and failed to notice that their entire team had died at once.  
---
Needless to say, ~~I sent the~~ I failed to surprise anyone except myself.
---
I got it now, dude spawned on my sniper crosshair..think it took less than 1s
---
Top tree arcstrider and Raiden Flux were how I got 6 kills twice in one IB match. Love it so much
---
Oof yeah that‚Äôll do it
---
On PC its Hard. Only Meta pleps you have to also use the Meta guns to stand a chance, Hackers on PC are rare on this elo but they exist (just got a DDOS in my last 2 Games one time it was me the next Game it was our carry) You get Qued with some People who use Blue Gear and nonmeta guns vs 3Premades (several Games in a row). I stopped trying until they fix Special ammo abuse, OEM and rebalance Mountentop / Recluse.
---
Ward of dawn soaks up the damage so if there was one in your match that you were firing at or super'd, that would give you really high damage numbers at the end. If this wasn't what you did, then well done on the high number.
---
Where is the OEM scope?
---
I do not aim with my hand......
---
I might just have to crash through and take a swipe...
---
Can you upload any model? Or image on a model? Or how's it made?
---
You really think so? I would say dreaming city is miles ahead. There are so many secrets in that place
---
Yeah it seems like the only way to progress is to get a win streak, and that's just not been happening for me, lol
---
That warlock must have one big ass to block a nova
---
Is this some sort of hunter joke I am too punch to understand?
---
Thanks!!! ‚úåÔ∏è
---
Is being taken some sort of metaphor?
---
Well, dealt damage doesn't necessarily mean a lot, I've often seen people with more damage than me but less kills. And to get such high damage, you probably shot at a lot of Titan supers etc., right? Because usual guardians don't suck up enough damage (around 200, depending on perks) to allow for such a high damage count (if only every second time dealing 200 damage was a kill in that round, you'd still be around the 50 kills mark). It's not easy, of course, but also needs a lot of luck and fitting conditions
---
Np! Good luck out there Guardian!
---
Yea, I feel you. I already had to wait 4 days to do every forge at maximum temper now it‚Äôs another part where I have to wait until a rare bounty drops to progress which is working for some and not for others. I don‚Äôt understand how one quest is so hard to fix. It seems every step they fix the next is broken. Weird.
---
This feels more like a Zavala thing...
---
The link doesn‚Äôt say anything about that buddy
---
just missing "guardian" at the end
---
Seems like individual performance as other said. I‚Äôm always near the top when solo‚Äôing pvp and i lose about 5-10 point per loss. You can‚Äôt always carry and win with a bunch of blueberries.
---
You need like Full PVP godroll armor on every piece if you are just a avarage pvp player and use these Meta guns all the time. (Also have a premade fireteam and all of them have Headsets and know their Class and also abuse the sh*t put of the meta).
---
Weird. I‚Äôve always gotten at least one prism from the 950...
---
Would only pull it out when smone tbags me. I would shoot him. And then return the favor.
---
Wheepost
---
That spots been like that since the beginning of the annual pass last year. Nothing has ever come of it yet
---
dont worry thats only roughly 150 days of your life dedicated to the cause.
---
Hey, just did a bit of research. I need to buy the fourth mask to unlock the rifle, then buy it for candy, but as far as it ending tonight, if I google it, it says it ends November 19th. Are you sure it ends tonight?
---
I know right. This is a very spicy format.
---
*laughs in riskrunner*
---
Are you running a gun with anti barrier rounds AND have breach retractor on your chest piece?  That combo helps to speed up grenade cooldown.
---
If you cant get it on your own you dont deserve. Change my mind
---
How do I stop getting the same guns over and over? Like is this all there is? Go Figure, Smugglers word,  Edge transit on a loop. What am I missing here.
---
[removed]
---
Crota put a hole in oryx‚Äôs ascendant plane and the vex immediately entered so I just can‚Äôt understand how she thinks this is a good idea.
---
ah
---
‚ÄúPlease retire the word yeet‚Äù. Hey asshole, that‚Äôs a request. Now I‚Äôm done with you because I don‚Äôt want to become dumber talking to you. Die
---
Swarm is decent since Tractor Cannon got nerfed. Love and Death (with spike and full court) and Wendigo are my two favorites!
---
Think it was the quest step :D must've been...
---
yet :D
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs really annoying how much this quest is time based, I just want the damn gun, hopefully the bounties will be fixed soon! I guess it just gives me a reason to save them up
---
Yh mb quest step I think
---
nope... just a quest step I think :D
---
Oh God I'm getting nightmares of the whisper of the worm quest
---
No, it should be him mantling and jumping off half way.
---
So is it still possible to get the sunbracers? Or do I just give up on a warlock build with it
---
We all are.
---
The only place in Destiny where mantle works
---
How is that cringe? What a weird thing to say lol
---
Ill do it for you Shaxx
---
I am able to do a cayde impression and for like a year I would say ‚Äúhey guardian‚Äù and the weak the forsaken trailer came out I started saying the line you know the line ‚Äúhow‚Äôs your sister‚Äù and when I went to collage it was so funny
---
I agree. How ‚Äòbout building it underground in one of the old, abandoned Warmind vaults or something? That way you have inherent containment capabilities if you lose control of the gate.
---
EDIT: Spelling
---
Whisper of the worm is a great heavy exotic sniper (if your familiar with D1 it‚Äôs the black spindle 2.0), the merciless fusion rifle is a very underrated dps weapon, and the graviton lance is a great pulse rifle for add clearing. Just to name a few exotics.
---
yeah wouldve been nice but they kept having issues with it not working as intended so they just removed it
---
Eyes on your own paper!
---
thanks for the ideas of yours.
---
the builds i read are quite good and had some heavy impact but still to complicated.
---
Im a simple Man.
---
just shooting and some Fists in Face.
---
It has no SBMM which is fine except it also claims to be connection  based which in my experience is markedly false. From what I've seen its a playlist that still has sbmm it just pulls from a larger player pool, this leads to matches that are just as sweaty as everywhere else, but with added lag and taken thrall-esque players.
---
When you're raiding late with headphones on and someone taps your shoulder. *turns*
---
Most beautiful thing I have ever seen.
---
You can‚Äôt deny you stole my meme so y u fightin
---
[deleted]
---
Well you tried to be funny
---
Is that a reference or a tip bc idk I‚Äôm dumb :/
---
Sorry to disappoint you, I have used it since it released, mainly because I loved the season of the forge and it was the only sniper I could hit shots with at the time, don't know why. Oh and also the reloading-sound: "Ka-Sching!"
---
I just hit legend with a wish ender, I've been using it for four seasons now. My entire loadout is built around the quick switch from wish ender to a hand cannon. With the right dexterity, weapon swap speed, and hand cannon I  can beat a pre-nerf Luna's in terms of ttk. Not to mention I can SEE MOTHERFUCKERS THROUGH WALLS. Someday I'll post a video of a perfect quick-switch kill here, but right now I'm just stoked that noone understands how OP it is.
---
How do you switch the elements, i can't seem to figure it out. Or is it a catalyst thing. When i got the weapon it was Arc and went into a gambit match it automatically switched to void and now it's stuck at void.
---
Sounds real good. Gawd I want an 8 string.
---
Same. Got all my precision kills and about 100 sniper kills in a 2 hour session. Not looking forward to continuing the grind
---
If you have a rare black armory bounty just hold onto it; completed, until you're at that quest step.
---
Not at all actually! But I do disagree with you that the 3.0 was indeed helpful. And I rarely have a team of those knuckleheads, just one or two, and the rest of us can hold it down while they're doing whatever it is they're doing.... and don't get it twisted friend, the theoretical 3.0kd's are out there, reminding the rest of us how great they are üòÇ
---
Awesome clutch dude. I've only ever played on PC so to me it is even more impressive that you can play a game that seems to be made for mouse and keyboard on the console and still play well.
---
Because it went free to play and moved to Steam at the same time, it's hard to say exactly how much of an effect each had.
---
I thought the Galor was a cruiser class vessel used by the Cardassians.
---
It's the steady pan that gets me.
---
Thats.... descriptive
---
150 hours?  Lmfao.
---
I had 500 hours in Forsaken alone.
---
They're also one of the reasons I always have my Goldtusk on me, so I can sword block their attacks, which woks most of the time.
---
Eh Outbreak was all repatriation. You just gotta get the feel for the jumping down, after you hammer it into yourself you don't for get it and can practically speed run it.
---
Did it with a friend, had the same issue and he almost rage quit. I mostly stood against the wall behind the broken pillar closest to  the entrance so that I could choke the thralls to two easy-to-see paths. It also blocked off Lord-shriekers purple death stare for the most part...
---
Only pinnacle drops and the season artifact go past 950 I believe. You need to earn other gear thru pinnacle activities
---
Ophidia spathe sealed ahamkaras grasp you could load so many bullets in rockets made launchers Jesus
---
Always thought for just halloween day each year,it would be awesome if they would just let everyone wear any amount of exotics they want to "dress up" always thought it would be a cool thing for them to do
---
Let us change our characters appearance/race/gender if we want and make it cost legendary shards or something.
---
He must show his beautiful blue bald head at all times.
---
Nope last season I got one
---
You do not need shadow keep for the vex offensive. Just the season pass.
---
I too would like him to narrate my entire life
---
Platform?
---
Man, what is that hand cannon you are using? A triple shot hand cannon? I‚Äôm jelly and I want it
---
Lord shaxx... The only pvp announcer who actually did a good job at helping me rebuild my self worth after losing a match
---
Not a fan of the season/battle passes implementation. The people who pay get a lot more exotics, resources, armour, in-game currency than the people who don't. It doesn't look like it now but this is the start to pay-to-win.
---
Yeah.    I...   Yeah.  Don't get me wrong I loved playing destiny on ps4.  But PC is just... It's not better.  It's more responsive. Like I can do what I want with my character alot faster then I could on console.
---
Me using tractor cannon
---
Crotas End but with Hive?
---
oh yeah
---
TANG MAN
---
You will get Divinity
---
It costs 10 bucks. Nothing in the pass is game breaking, and you get a decent amount of free stuff. The only reason someone would complain is if they dont have the TEN dollars to spend on dlc lol and if thats the case, get a job and get some $
---
Regardless of the season, I still feel as if I should‚Äôve received something from that quest. I just pledged allegiance to the drifter and completed his quests. Plus, I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve made the vanguard too happy by picking the drifter‚Äôs side. I would‚Äôve expected to of been rewarded for my loyalty.
---
But it is what it is lol
---
You should get it
---
I'm feeling this with shattered throne rn, but mostly because I'm a 200 hour new light and didn't know what it was so I soloed it for an hour or two until the end and gave up for obvious reasons.
---
 Did it once with my friend, he gave up almost immediately after we died once on the petitioner 
---
Think I might just wait a bit for this fine addition to my collection...
---
I'll go for a bit. What are you playing on and what's your gamer tag?
---
Ok thanks
---
Thanks
---
Just did it tonight so happy. Thorn is incredible. We ended up camping on the hill with exotic bows and decent heavies &amp; supers.
---
Oh alright, thanks!
---
