That‚Äôs some pretty good luck in the top right of your screen. Looks like RNGesus likes you.

---
---
Wish you could rename weapons. Guess what I would rename this to...
---
It's fun. Personally I don't touch crimson much b/c I like to play at range, but it's real good for kill cleanup
---
The glory matchmaking should be determined by the highest glory on each team. There should be an influx of players playing comp once the season resets. You just are playing at the end of the season when people have already grinded Luna's and have stopped playing. Consequently, the comp player base is much smaller right now. Imo at least. The only thing that resets is your glory. The quest steps keep their progress
---
I won't boot anyone from my team regardless of how many motes lost he is a great player and indivual we hang out for fun not to play professional if wanted to play serious in and in a team that cares only for the game I would but I enjoy hanging out with friends and family and no matter who has a bad game would never boot them cause I'm.not that type of human being which I can't say for you 
---
Fuck that, you did great OP 
---
I agree but warlock is a decent class its definitely not the best if you can use it correctly its damn good. The rift is very situational. People usually put half of the around a corner and peek then clean or heal while dodging. The barricade is really only good for getting away. It doesn't stop super and most of the time when I put a barricade down it gets destroyed pretty fast. The hover throwz people off a good amount and if you got good aim that a couple shots you can sink in before they even shoot you. If you have wings of sacred dawn and bottom tree dawn blade you can hover then hold b, square or whatever the crouch button is on your system and you heal. The higher you are the better heal. The top tree dawn blade has midair dodge. And its either top or bottom tree its blades seek the target which helps with it explosive impact. For voidwalker i believe top tree you can charge nades. Charge about axion bolt itll seek teh target and leave them 1 shot. If you use the dlc stormcaller class you can DESTROY super and opponents as well as get some super back if you cut it off quick. I get what your saying and I mean no disrespect. It's a harder class to use depending on how you play. Its definitely a fun class and currently the one I've been using most.

I ordered mine on February 9th and still have not received it. Wondering if anyone can tell me how long it took to recieve after they ordered it?
---
For those wanting to know, they were Knuclehead Radar and Lucky Pants
---
That looks great! You should try one of the escalation protocol weapons, those are cool.
---
Yeah. I could see that for sure. I have the catalyst for it. So excited to try it out. 
---
Yeah, I've pretty much given up for now. Maybe I'll give it a shot after the reset.
---
Mine came to $28.62 with standard shipping.
---
Dang it really did look like he just slammed his head into the wall
---
good for you
---
I'm away from my console or I would. But just to double check, your using the built-in LFG tool on the Xbox UI right? 
---
I do, but it just takes too long to kill something with it to get the procs up. YMMV of course.
---
I'm on the last reset
---
Yeah, LFG just isn‚Äôt showing up anything for me for Shattered Throne
---
Thank you ever so much.
---

---
One more question - going back to the SoL. I obtained a SoL randomly from the Blind Well with my Hunter. So you're telling me, another SoL can't possibly drop again that way? If not, I hope the Visions of Light mission is replayable. :P
---
I'm talking about the public event itself. The Ether Harvest. But I'm annoyed that I'm trying to complete the quest and I can't because I'm just not getting the right event. 
---
You must have a high power lvl
---
So if I‚Äôm almost at 3 resets at the same quest step as op, am I going to have all 5 resets during the season of the drifter to complete it ? Or do the 3 I have count for it ?
---
this is true but also wtf was he thinking jumping in front of the guy with rockets? if he was behind him for so long he would have seen him fire the first one
---
You'll have to do all five resets next season if you wait.
---
Thank you, I‚Äôm on the part where I have to reset your valor 5 times for broadsword 
---
Does anyone actually know when the bungie scale model ones get delivered? I feel like I ordered it ages ago
---
Malnefencence
---
You're right, it's not the best. But it's yours, that's pretty cool.
---
We'll see what they drop the kill range to with the nerf. I'd guess it'll go from 9 to 7 meters but if it goes to 6 or less meters it'll be a pretty brutal nerf. Usher the era of Erentil FR4
---
Well done man

ORAORAORAORAORAORAORA

Boost macro?

Because oneshot meta is so great for finding out who the better player is.
---
RiskRunner Titan Build when? hahah
---
I legit did this like day one. As a Titan, I felt like I was just coming out of assembly.
---
yeup x10 jumps per second 
---
Idk. Hand cannons just feel too dominant at most, if not all, ranges. There are maybe two maps where you want a pulse, scout or snipe. 
---
hahahaha wait until you want nf
---
I 100% disagree with you.
---
A 1v1 Bygones battle or a 1v1 Lunas battle has way more skill than a shotty battle. 90% of a shotty battle is who has a better roll/ who saw who first.
---
Can't we have both?
---
No you can see it on top. I think it may be the one from the annual pass as I looked to my collection
---
You kind of have to do one more frame, for the memes.
---
I gaurentee #69 will be drop mag, KC, and rampage
---
Maybe if you went over and left instantly the stealing their invasion would be balanced but it would lock you out if you got a kill. Because then you can camp the portal sleeper or queenbreaker them, get three healing their primeval by 36 percent and then run back to your side preventing them from even trying to invade. Granted for this exact scenario alot would have to work exactly right but still.
---
 its all good, ive already started anew on a Titan. right off the bat i can tell this class is going to be far more practical, and, at its worst may be lacking the ability to fly around like the other classes, but this isn't anthem, ill just walk.
---
That just sounds like D1Y3 Khovstov with extra steps
---
I love it
---
Since when do titan have so much resistance ? Mine get blown up by 2 or 3 shot even in super.
---
Correct me if i'm wrong, but it has tracking and also doesn't loop in the air like grenade launchers
---
Tracking = Aim assist. People who really think it needs a nerf should go and cry somewhere else..

If its forsaken vs diablo 3 I would get Forsaken &amp; Path of Exile.

Sorry, I forgot to mention I‚Äôm trying to be more casual than before especially since my girlfriend will be playing me.

Ive said to before and I'll say it again: where's my goddamn headbanging emote?!

Congrats and thanks for your time teaching people!
---
Back in d1 every strikte had a prologue and this line from Zavala is THE d1 meme combined with the say it meme.

Yes

Point still stands. Path of Exile is a decent free diablo like. Saving you the cash to get forsaken.

Alright thanks!

7 hours ago... were you that guy titanskating with a shotgun while wearing the one eyed monster? Because I dont regret it. I also dont regret teabagging your teammate, since you apparently didnt realze that you werent playing comp.
---
Who, me?
---
&gt;you can get it out of the collections tab
---
Good Lord. You just saved me so much time! :)
---
Thanx a lot. Yup, i can get it from collections
---
It costs:
---
500 Glimmer
---
5 Legendary shards
---
5 Gunsmith Materials
---
7 Enhancement Core
---
excuse me, but have you heard of the mountaintop, aka. the direct hit from team fortress 2?
---
U mean 4%??
---
I started my Warlock three weeks ago after only playing Titan. 
---
Whew boy all those Warlock vendors that are assholes are nice if you're a Warlock. Ada-1, Asir Mir, Brother Vance, they all complain if you spend one picosecond in their presence as a Titan (I'm guessing if you're a Hunter too), telling you you're dumb, all you do is headbutt stuff and don't mess the place up but if you're a Warlock they're a whole lot nicer. Ada still has her general animosity towards Guardians but she says something like "You're a curious one aren't you" and other lines rather than "Don't knock over my expensive vase with your shoulders Titan."
---
I thought it was a nice touch that Bungo put that in the game. 
---
I'm scared of goblins tho, lol. Get to a point could be 3 goblins all shielding each other and you have to push their connection apart, by that time invader and all the mote hoarders get annihilated
---
judging by your post history, you were apparently not the dude with drb and oem. As you might have guessed I am still a bit salty getting stomped by a 4stack 
---
That's how mafia works
---
Nah, and even if i did play comp i'd use a sniper, and i'm not on PC so i can't skate
---
It's gay behavior that's for sure
---
Riskrunner has honestly been my favourite exotic recently. Such a powerful weapon for ad clear with only a small caveat, it has outclassed some of my favourite exotics tbh, that includes whisper
---
Guess it's the result of bungies incompetence in the end. Being able to do it in the first place is just not okay.
---
Now that you said it, I realized i need it.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong it‚Äôs under rated for sure, as an arc warlock main it rarely leaves my inventory but I want new bread üçû 
---
Or it‚Äôs got a good signal
---
Vote kick would help too but I guess that is too complicated to implement eh Bungo?
---
Agreed
---
I absolutely love my synthoceps. Managed to snag a pair from Xur just the other day. Now I get to be all punch happy and annihilate everything in my path :)
---
I can confirm, my pew pew experience has significantly improved!
---
They're pretty meh in pvp, especially compared to something like Orpheus Rig, at least imo
---
Maybe but then you might match into a strike where the other two people are in a fireteam and you beat the strike with them and right before the loot chest is rewarded they kick you
---
[slapping and clapping intensifies]
---
Ow.
---
Hunters will never stop crying til every ability they have is one shot and every other classes ability barely does any damage 
---
What kind of fuckin madman is dis
---
Me too. I never see those.
---
I could see this, Last night in Crucible a guy with Chaperone killed me from Hella far away as i was putting bursts of rounds into him with my Blast furnace. It was kind of ticking me off, but before that a guy with Le Monarch was able to put me down in 2-3 shots while i was putting rounds into him with my Furnace as well. Maybe i was having a bad night but it did seem like it was tickling people more then killing them.
---
Wtf? What movie is this from? Not Gavin, I mean the soldiers
---
Mmmmmmm me like hunter 
---
I feel your pain. Nothing more to say
---
.
---
Ah a legendary, a exotic power weapon and power ammo to test out the power weapon. A truly wonderful trinity.
---
Personally, I think shoulder charge should one shot. It's just too deeply engrained in the Titan playstyle at this point that I'd hate to take it away from them. That being said, I don't think it should be as easy to pull off as it is. I think making it take juuust a bit longer to charge would make a big difference.
---
Yep. If you suffer, take someone with you. Misery loves company. At the same time, there are seriously some things Bungo could have done FAR better without destroying them. The changes to OEM seem more like a Balance to me as opposed to straight Gutting like Nova got. No complaints here for OEM, I saw this coming. It's still going to be used often. 
---
When this happens i usually leave the strike early and start a new one. Im not working for some afk leach. 
---
I had one drop as I was reigniting the Gofannon Forge &amp; I had to do a double take to make sure I wasn‚Äôt randomly fighting the Trickster
---
When is glory rank being reset? Today or next week?
---
A common engram.
---
Alright who woke up Rasputin

MIDA multi tool. It's a Scout Rifle. It's not that hard to get and a very good weapon (although I prefer another Scout). 
---
https://www.light.gg/db/items/1331482397/mida-multi-tool/
---
I used to get so pissed about getting killed by it, then I got one and started to learn how oblivious I was by watching others. Getting Jotunn actually made me a better player in terms of situational awareness.
---
It's still OP, but I think it's OP in that "it's taking up an exotic" sort of way.
---
LOL

Oh josh oh frick

Awesome in PvE, not so much PvP. It's an awesome trash clearer, but not very good to kill real big heavies with...that's what nighthawk is for.
---
Decided to make a titan and luckily picked em up so I have a good time waiting for me once I get to level 20
---
Get 3 people and run eat Kings for EP... Absolute annihilation
---
With the sealed ahamkaras grasps, you don‚Äôt have to even kill them. You do with the grave robber perk that can drop but with the grasps it‚Äôs just melee hits I believe
---
I rolled a Baligant XU7743 with full auto/ rampage and I DELETED IT LAST NIGHT without reading the changes yet.
---
/facepalm
---
I hope you never do that
---
Why
---
Thanks - was it one big piece - or smaller ones assembled? How'd you assemble them if so?  Did you design the model yourself?  Thanks for the support
---
That sucks! But I dont have any high-impacts with full auto, plus I'm just happy with the mindbenders ambition I have.
---
I just found a better fighting lion build. West of sunfall 7, fighting lion, drangons shadow and top gunslinger. Try it it's surprisingly good. 
---
Remember that cursed period shortly after the Rise of Iron patch in which it was possible for level 40 characters to get greens... *shudders*
---
I recently clocked 15k kills on that sweet rifle. There's no better!
---
I agree. I wish I also had an ads sensitivity along with normal sensitivity. Many times I like to have low sense for running around but scoping in seems much too slower for when I need to drag scope.
---
I‚Äôm always curious how difficult adding these settings would be though. For all I know, the game isn‚Äôt setup to easily add this option
---
Once you get used to rof thing melts guardians like butter

Nice, TLW has neck rolls. I love it!!!

While that would be true, most builds right now (nova bomb, tether and such) are build for high up-time and restore-on-kill to begin with, or don't even need their supers to clean effective.
---
It really just further increases the gap between well communicating teams and solo play - which already is a problem in gambit now.

omg i could pay like thousands $ for the last word. if i had any. its SO good.

I just got a full auto rampage one last night. Also be able to use my sexy ass mindbenders ambition.

This is what I have but want feeding frenzy-rampage :( xx
---
Awesomesauce. Glad to hear it. 
---
My office walls are bare, and I want to decorate them with stuff from my favorite games.
---
 World of Warcraft held me since 2007, then I quit that for Destiny back in season 3 and have literally played nothing else.
---
I have horde symbols and even a print of the Warlords from one of the expansions, but having Ace, The Last Word, and eventually Thorn on my walls? *epic*
---
No man, it just goes away for some time
---
Yup, I'll take that contact info as well.  Would love to have something like this on my wall.  
---
Bug. If it makes you feel any better it was never curated. Any BA forge weapon that you can‚Äôt pick up shows the MW visual effect. Same thing happens in Volundr, Gofannon, etc. where you can‚Äôt even get curated rolls at all. Just FYI, curated rolls go directly to your inventory (or to postmaster if your inventory is full) upon completion of the forge event, same as with J√∂tunn and Le Monarque. They don‚Äôt drop on the ground as an engram. 
---
I can sense my 7th Icebreaker coming from that light
---
I think its the one that says that you need to destroy all of the eggs in the Last Wish raid.
---
Bro i recently discovered what is a god roll so if don't want this downvote and go away
---
H A W K M O O N
---
Someone told me that Bungie is moving on to other things thus making this iron banner the last and finale one for destiny 2
---
You might have better luck if you lfg the forge (destiny companion app, [destinylfg.com](https://destinylfg.com), r/fireteams).  Communication can be a big deal with alot of the Destiny activities, until you are at a high enough level that you can take up the slack for someone else who is not performing at par.  
---
If you do not like to lfg (I am not real comfortable doing it myself) you may want to join a clan.  Look for one that has active players that are high lvl.  Clanmates are usually willing to help other clanmates get through tougher content.
---
If you are being matched with others that are below 625 then the boss is gonna be tough for you. That is the way the game is designed.  Grind out the milestones to get higher gear and then come back.
---
Don't be so dramatic.  It is a video game.  No one here is gonna tell you to kill yourself over asking a question.  Most of us want to help people have a good experience in the game.  Based on your comment though, I would strongly suggest you speak to someone about your self-esteem issues.  It sounds like you have alot more going on than just being frustrated with a video game.
---
Ah right. That will make sense as I‚Äôve not done that yet.
---
Chimera? Who? 
---
Thorn
---
[removed]
---
Now, what do you run with in order to get that kind of kill count?
---
The recoil is just so MANAGEABLE. I've had mine since I started playing.
---
Fake news
---
Sunshot! Love that gun! 
---
Not just any Ace, Last Word, and Thorn, but each of them *unique* and one of a kind.  That's why I commissioned these.  These are truly exotic.
---
I'm in the same boat, bare walls, I want something to put up in my gamer cave.  My friend was really down on her luck, broke her leg really bad in a car crash, her husband left, she's still going and doing what she can with her art.  I'm happy to help her out and get something nice like this in return.  I intend to keep commissioning more, I already have massive game libraries, it's time for some more unique things to keep around.
---
**We want thorn** ^plz bozz^
---
Thorn 
---
Wait till you get a solid girlfriend.
---
When you play too much Doomfist...
---
No Corrupted again.....
---
EA has never stated that Anthem is a Destiny killer. Destiny players are the ones who started this nonsense because of how easy it would be to make a game better than Destiny 2. 
---
Better devil (crucible handcannon) is a solid hand cannon. 
---
What is a good roll for it? 
---
Le Monarque is the first weapon to challenge my Fighting Lion for that slot in awhile. 
---
Hello yes, person who knows things here.  
---
When you kill the final boss of Forsaken, Voice of Riven, it spits Uldren out and you can see this a few seconds before the cutscene plays.
---
  
---
:)
---
Same eververse set as the helmet :)
---
No fucking hammerhead again why bungie 
---
And here we are ladies and gentlemen with the third strange terrain week in the last month
---
Got lucky amd got this ship last week, still need that damn shell though.
---
Flashpoint Mercury?!
---
I'm pretty sure I got the Ghost shell the first week of Forsaken, and haven't gotten the ship or sparrow since üôÑ
---
Acrius can do every encounter, I personally think riven might be hard, but a cluster rocket does the trick. 
---
Depends on your play style. Some ppl like outlaw and kill clip/rampage. I have one with opening shot and it feels pretty good. Just try to get a bunch and see. If you get drop mag on any of them, it boost up the reload on the gun big time. Also, explosive rounds is pretty good as well.
---
Thank you, as always!
---
doesn't the drifter make referance to the thorn when you get the mal? i  haven't finished the quest yet so i dont know
---
Yeah but these never drop at 650 light.
---
It‚Äôs because the skill gap is so small. This has been explained in a lot of videos about FPS games. To summarize it, make the game so that almost all players can win on a consistent basis. That makes it so that more people are likely to continue playing because they win around half the time. Call of Duty has been doing this more &amp; more over the years. 
---
Stay Away Gl
---
Literally every week it *isn't* Strange Terrain, many people comment here saying they wished it was Strange terrain. So many problems would be solved by having a set rotation of nightfalls, instead of a random selection like we have now. 
---
Are your shoulders pretty sore from carrying your team? 
---
Explosive rounds is available on this?? 
---
Don't worry, you're not the first to find this. 
---
Here I am waiting for a single kinetic hand cannon to drop with at least Outlaw... 
---
The only thing I would say is make sure you take advantage of all powerful gear rewards (weekly or daily)
---
been running the extra bullet since i got it and rolled into it. the additional rampage shot helps more than you‚Äôd think
---
Destiny isn't a Battle Royale so the odds of any other looter-shooter "killing" it is highly unlikely. 
---
&gt;Maybe let players choose the path to an exotic, pvp or pve
---
I think Malfeasance having a step where either you got 1 army of one medal, or a teammate got 4 army of one medals was a good compromise. You still had to kill guardians, but those of us who cannot reliably get army of one medals still had a path to completing the quest by finding a more skilled player to play with. 
---
Hawkmoon
---
I play on PC so I can‚Äôt help you there. 
---
I actually found it after the main campaign. Its my favorite so far üòé 
---
Could I get the link as well?
---
Ik but Im an idiot who waited till the season is almost over so I have to wait till next 
---
Suppression grenade bro, l2p
---
Yea I agree. I've been lucky and have had mine since week 1 drop so I've rolled em all but with Hand Cannon  Enhanced Armor Rolls you next to never have Outlaw running. But I 100% agree that everyone has their own preference and can be just as effective.
---
meanwhile I'm over here with quickdraw, slideways. 
---
I don't understand how the text makes sense with the image? Why are you, your teammate, and a Titan with One Eyed and Luna's Howl beating up a copier together?
---
I believe when you pull up the ghost during that mission despite it saying "Voice of Riven" below, it says "Defeat The Chimera" for the objectives at the top left.
---
It's my opinion on a game... it's shit. 
---
That's my point. You state an opinion with nothing to back it up, and still continue to prove me right 
---
True. But you'd think some people would at least start open minded
---
Dude I agree with you but this violates sub rules
---
I got it yesterday afternoon. Getting a grip of it in pvp takes a little while but I had plenty of fun IB games using it. It destroys groups of mobs and yellow bars in forge too. 10/10 worth it 
---
Do I have to jump into crucible after I reset?  Or does it drop immediately after I reset it?  
---
Yup. So tru
---
Too* 
---
You cretin /s
---
Now I need to change my underwear.
---
It drops when you actually do the reset.
---
If you are lucky - 1/1. As people have shown, it's possible to actually get decent exotic drops.  
---
If you are unlucky, Never. Destiny 2 may not be in production long enough for you to get it.
---
That apostrophe use does not spark joy. 
---
oof
---
Anyone have any advice on how to Solo Dul Incaru on hunter? (Max Light)

You mean a warmind?

Woa.

Thank you!

Yes that would have been the better joke but im in too far now. 
---
am i allowed to hop on this train? Ive had unactivated for about 2 years now. thanks anyway 
---
Thornnnnn
---
I guess the RNG gods are kinder to some. I got Chromatic Fire and Jotunn last week while running Bergusia forge, on the same ignition. Chromatic Fire dropped during wave 2 from a yellow bar shank and Jotunn at the end along with the radiant frame. The Blast Furnace I had just forged had the Burgusian Night shader.
---
Fucking almost had a heart attack. 
---
Erentil is worse than anything else fusion riflea should be in heavy slot 
---
Pathfinder's Crash in the EDZ. Drops as an engram from the lost sector boss.
---
Those don't boost damage to the extent of other perks, they just add an AOE effect. Not only that, but it can mess up headshot-based procs, like the Outlaw roll you have there. 
---
they should just up the available Nightfalls to 5 :)
---
It is more common than it should be. 
---
Why?
---
Powerful gear rewards. People want powerful gear,  don't want to do the work for it. Same reason people cheese raids etc.
---
Well that‚Äôs better than being close to 5 resets as the season ends. 
---
As should shotguns.
---
HawkMoon!
---
They could've gave us double xp for crucible this week
---
Step on his toes, quick! 
---
I'm interested in them as well, please send me the link as well!  
---
Next tuesday.
---
You can‚Äôt have the Last Word without Thorn.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve had Luna‚Äôs since the first two weeks it came out and honestly I just get bored of using it and want to use different guns. I like to use other hand cannons as well such as kindled orchid and ace and last word but it does put me at a disadvantage on console knowing 180s are significantly better. 
---
March 5 is when the new season starts per the banner that just popped up when I started playing today. 
---
Just in case you are not aware, the only quest steps whose progress is reset are the ones that ask you to reach a certain rank within a season. All other quest steps will keep their progress.

Yeah but your overall DPS and damage per full reserve is still lower than a 90 or 72RPM sniper rifle. I would recommend Y1 Show of Force, Tatara Gaze, or The Long Goodbye.
---
F.
---
Ah.
---
Took me exactly 62 clears on last wish to get my 1k and I used it for one day and vaulted it due to how terrible its damage and ammo reserves are. Super disappointed I spent 5-6 months chasing a gun that ended up getting vaulted. 
---
Malfeasance
---
True man. Feel the same way. Same reason I use bows even though they are not at a competition level. It's just so much fun! Im not going professional anytime soon so fun is my main goal. 
---
I thoroughly enjoyed this, thank you.
---
i'm with you bro
---
Yes. Anthem is a beautiful game with awesome control mechanics. It's awesome to fly and the combat feels so good. Just give BioWare some time and I know that the game will get better just like Destiny 1 and 2. But from now I will stick with Destiny 2. 
---
I wish I could have Tatara, that's the one sniper I want. But it hasn't been in the rotation. And I had the initial frame for my titan but the quest was bugged and it disappeared from my inventory. 
---
I have the same roll, basically a kinetic Arsenic Bite. I love it!
---
A clanmate did the last 4 hours in gambit.. never waited longer than 1-2.
---
This is oc dont steal or i will eat you moms‚Äô pee pee
---
BALLYHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
---
I know.
---
So that‚Äôs completely wrong
---
Only if you want to redo the red war, if recommend doing the red war on another character instead of deleting your character 
---
it was pretty good when it came out and the dps was insane with high frames :/
---
Coulda told you that. I've gotten six...sigh.
---
Ive had like 8 meatballs in the last few months.  Abnormally high spawn rate for me.  And thats only doing Gambit for the daily/weekly runs and a few more for Gambit quests. 
---
I got the kill on the first one a while back, but really enjoy doing my best to get the kill for the team still. Pretty awesome to see the side scroll of people get it that have not yet when we get a kill. 
---
It was available like 2 rotations ago.
---
Quality 
---
No was...uh...on sabbatical. I left right after COO and didn't come back until Forsaken had been out for a few weeks. Kinda regret not sticking around, honestly.
---
Not these specifically, they're mine.  But I can PM you her facebook page and you could get in contact with her to commission a painting.
---
Had this happen to me basically daily.. changing my NAT settings to "open" (port forwarding) fixed it entirely.
---
I think that like D1, it pushes the current console platform too far. D1 was constrained badly by having to support PS3 (which I had). I suspect that Frostpite isnt efficient enough to run Anthem well on PS4. There's definitely a bigger hit for me on PC with Anthem than D2.

You can outplay a fusion. The big issue was Telesto before its timing nerd

My main issue, me being mainly a (I'm only playing crucible for 15 games \[5 games per character obviously\] per week for my challenges) is that the roaming supers last waaaay too long in PvP. I get that theres Exotic armor for (almost?) all classes/subclasses that increase the amount of time you can remain roaming as long as you're getting kills, but I feel its just waaay too much time. In QP, most of the time people aren't grouped up to teamshot the super. I'm fine with these Exotics granting extra super energy with kills, but I feel like they need to tune the max amount of time you can remain supered. I'm also aware (I think?) that Spectral Blades got a nerf in the last big tuner but I think its kind of silly that they can melee around for so long without burning too much of their super. Its basically like sword dashing/flying but they also have increased resilience so you very rarely have a chance to do any real damage. Maybe they should only have so many dodges before it goes into a cooldown or maybe if you melee and miss so many times, it would also have a cooldown, or maybe a bigger super energy penalty for each consecutive melee without doing damage, or just simply a bigger penalty for melee without an enemy in your crosshairs? Idk, I'm just throwing out ideas at this point. Another thing I would personally like to see is that for those roaming supers that seem so tanky like they're designed to be, (I have no issue with the increased health) I would like to see a change in the way their health is represented, my suggestion would be to make their shield have more health to represent the extra health they have when supered, and then their red bar to represent just that, their health if they were not supered and their shield were also popped. I feel like that would make it a whole lot easier to understand just how much health they have left and a teammate could call out that their shield is popped and you can decide if its worth risking an engagement to try to kill that person. It's just a thought though, theres probably some mechanics I'm not familiar with that would make this impossible to do from the dev side and essentially just make these wasted words

&amp;#x200B;

But, OP, I see your point, Titan is, to me at least, probably the most versatile, (therefore busted) class in the game. I am very glad that they are nerfing OEM, however I am curious to see how they do it. (They haven't announced those changes right?)
---
Anyway, those are a couple of my opinions, from a Crucible Wallflower who occasionally has his moments of glory (or is it valor? ;) since I despise Comp right now \[don't even get me started on the current meta, thats a whole separate post that if i wrote out, would be like 20 times longer than this one lmao\])
---
**TL;DR:**  IMO roaming Supers need to be tuned a little bit, and just as a suggestion, players that are Supered could use a health representation change, bigger shield to represent increased resiliency, normal red bar value to better help people understand how much health that person actually has left. Again, no change to the increased health, just change they way that extra health is represented.

**Thank you for attending my Destiny 2 TEDTalk. If only there were a college major that was solely based on writing Dissertation length post on reddit for the games that I love, then I might finally be able to graduate.  Or is that basically just Journalism with an Entertainment Media focus? Hmmmm. Jesus this post is all over the place.... If you made it this far legitimately, I sincerely applaud you.**

What a line 
---
As someone who has hundreds of hours in D2, the game has no content and no build variety. The gameplay itself is rather lacking too, its an FPS with some abilities sprinkled in, and 1 of them is just a grenade.
---
Even with Forsaken, the game gives you an illusion of content but falls flat on its face rather quickly. The dungeons in this game, 'strikes' are short and boring.
---
The people who played since Forsaken launched are also doing the same mundane crap over and over for months on end now, with some story progression sprinkled in, in the form of short, simple dialogue. 
---
Loot in D2 is nice, exotics are cool but unfortunately due to the build variety in this game being nonexistent the exotics are almost useless and you will just try to get 1 or 2 specific ones that are the best.
---
People are deluding themselves saying how great D2 is, but in fact its not better than it was before, there's just 'more' of it now.
---
That said, I enjoyed D2 since launch and I enjoy it now, but it is in now way the amazing game people are making it out to be with forsaken.
---
Have fun though, it's a nice journey. But for me, Anthem is already miles ahead of D2 just because of the gameplay. I also enjoy creating and testing out builds. I have 90+ hours on just the ranger javelin and just now started dabbling with the storm, trying out pure ability builds with focus on cooldown reduction and elemental damage. Its something that I've been missing in Destiny since the first game.
---
I acknowledge you typing all of what you did, but in reality all you gotta do is put points in mobility and 1 tap whoever. GoW shotgunning is a whole other story tbh
---
Sans. I wish for sans
---
Ratios are way off on TLW. Unacceptable. Do it over.
---
Joking obv. Seriously though, so nice seeing an actual painting. I get tired of kids scribbling in Photoshop claiming their art is a "painting". That's nice work
---
"Everything"?
---
I would but i have this thing where i'm weird and don't like the idea of wearing other people's clothes lol, T'is it's really sad that what bought me back to D2 was them killing my favourite character. If the rumours of Uldren being the new Hunter boss person is true imma pissed at that as well, Should be me (well, us) after all the fucking work we've done saving everyones asses through D1 + D2 (I transferred my hunter over)
---
Its not supposed to, but this bug has been around since gambit came out. I cant recall if bungie ever figured out what the problem is.
---
Do not speak of the cursed one
---
Thron
---
Why not?
---
Well I'm kinda done, thought forsaken would make it worth my time, I was mistaken.
---
U right so he lying or missing details
---
Is it faster to post a question to Reddit and wait for an answer, or just Google it?
---
Ah, crap.. never run it and all my regulars stopped playing :(
---
Googled and couldn‚Äôt find anything, also i like the community? Sorry my question offended you. 
---
Gotcha thanks!
---
It was a legit question - wasn't trying to clown you.
---
This is so low effort. 
---
ü•õ
---
Voice of riven sir
---
Started playing like 3-4 months after forsaken &amp; I‚Äôm only 620 across my 3 characters so I‚Äôm in the same boat. Never done any forge besides the Volundr. So that means still no Jotunn for me :-( 
---
^ This is the correct answer, and well worded too, cheers man. I feel like Bungie should just remove the option to log in with Google until it's fixed, cause it looks pretty bad.
---
Also in case anybody else is struggling with this, I just made a Bungie password and logged in with that instead.
---
Honestly getting tired of this bullcrap.
