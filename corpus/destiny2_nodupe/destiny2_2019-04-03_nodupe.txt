I wasn't explaining, I was just saying people still shoot it....  More of a mockery to everyone else who still shoots it out of a defensive reflex, but doesn't matter because you chose to be offended by a rando on the net, good luck with that!

Yep, tangled shore has a flashpoint

Good old Share Play haha. Sweet video though, nice shooting üôÇ
---
That‚Äôs weird since she never sells old exotics except for ornaments
---
You have geomag, chill
---
\&gt;  And that weapon is exclusively good in PvP. So where is the problem?  
---

---
The problem exists for the 99%+ of us who enjoy PvP but don't have the free time to dedicate to unlocking the NF.  There's no point in me continuing this discussion if your ego won't allow you to take an objective look at the problem.
---
Again, I urge you to think about literally any competitive PvP game out there.  If you can provide me an example of another game rewarding the top &lt;1% players with an item in the game that provides more competitive advantage than any other item in the game, I'll eat my shoe.
---
Lol. Not even close to as good, on a subclass thats not great in pvp 
---
It's mainly a confirmation bias people are trying to get. About I'd say about half of the player base hates j√∂tun because it's hard to get so not alot of people have it and it's overpowered as all get out if your on console because warlocks and titans don't have a doge move to get behind cover, including it can one hit supers and over shield which makes it bassically unfair if the person knows what their doing. Including you don't need to have good aim cause of the tracking like wardcliff. But the point is because alot of People hate the gun they will keep coming back to post like this to see if any new developments have happend instead of spamming bingo's twitter with "pls nerf spectral and J√∂tun it's ruining your player base" tweets.
---
Lol I‚Äôm on the other side. I have all Hunter exotics except for Gwinsin Vest. I got back into D2 after the Shards nerf and they pretty much collect dust in my vault. Sucks when you only need one last exotic and pick up your third Gemini Jester doesnt it 
---
This is about how long it took me me. It was a nightmare (strangely fun) but it was the first time I‚Äôve been able to plan my supers/armors/perks on the go. 
---
Hawkmoon was average. Its perk wasn't that great. 
---
LMFAO "refracts off hard surfaces" my clan mate used to do this to himself in leviathan baths on the big guys. used to rage so much.
---
Snitch
---
Name one other game with PvP that rewards the top &lt;1% of the players with the best weapon in the game.  I'll be waiting... 
---
Wrap your brain around that fact that not everyone has 5+ hours a day to play a videogame, that doesn't mean we should have inferior weapons to those who prioritize videogames over real life.  There are plenty of opportunities to show off your lack of employment and real life responsibilities, the trophy doesn't have to be the best weapon in the game.  It can be a shader or an emblem, don't be a bitch.
---
‚ÄúThe trick is living long enough after your super finishes so you can get that stuff refunded.‚Äù This quote is you being condescending explaining it, no point in lying on an archived conversation. Try discussing something without feeling the need to act superior by explaining common information and instead bring a valid point.
---
Warlocks are only good when using their super though. Outside super Hunter and Titan are better and even then Hunter flat out has better supers and Titan arguably has better supers
---
I have 65k on no turning back

Edit. I didn't max the gun out. It just stopped at 9989 for some reason and I thought that was the cap. Now im at 10000+. Oops.

Lmao
---
I've played destiny for five years. I can say what I feel like. A fans loyalty only stretches so far after all the lies and rip-offs. 
---
he isnt defending them, he's just telling you there was a reason for it to get nerfed. Yes spectral lasts that long, but spectral isnt balanced it?
---
wah, i need to think when i use my super now, wah wah
---
Damn near pitched a tent in my pants. Had a buddy playing on his own console and TV sitting right next to me when this happened (we frequently go command center in my living room on weekends). I saw the opportunity to be a god if I pulled it off that shot and no joke, stood up, yelled in anticipation, and fist pumped that beautiful piece of marksmanship into reality. Almost wish I had footage of me and the ridiculous that ensued over the clip lol. I‚Äôm a nerd. I live for this shit. I will dance out a nasty play IRL. Not ashamed.
---
??? So what about nova bomb and skull? Do you need to think or just throw it whenever you want 
---
RNGesus hates me. Duplicate Sixth Coyote, Lucky Pants, and then Peacekeepers within 3 hours.

Pretty sure they meant drop rates for the new Reckoning and some of the Dreaming City weapons. Read the article, not just the headline.

where did i say you need to think when you use Nova Bomb?

Haha thanks
---
Queen Mara I don't feel so good
---
Nova doesn‚Äôt do that much more damage and when you do use it to damage a boss you don‚Äôt get any super energy back unless you kill it(which is only 1 kill). With Shards you can damage a boss and get right back to 75% energy allowing you to then quickly hit the boss again with another BB...and repeat until it‚Äôs dead. Shards shouldn‚Äôt be able to get energy back as effectively on adds as Skull because that‚Äôs all Skull is good for, Shards is still very good for boss damage where as Skull is useless on bosses.
---
Done

They have no flashpoint.

They just need to either get rid of perks, or add perks to every older gear, and allow us to individually roll perks for a few shards or something.

Nova warp was killing people through multiple walls. It needed an adjustment. Not saying they had to neuter it the way they did, but it needed to be fixed.

You should have had the Nova warp treatment. Make it useless and then Buff it in the future. I know you're going to say, but people aren't going to change their loadout just because it got a little bit of a Nerf you got to slam it hard before people change.

It takes literally an afternoon to get to fabled and its super easy to play around Lunas because of its mediocre range. The point of these weapons is being rewarded for being good at pvp, it is supposed to be hard

Victory correlates with the number of spectral blades on a team.

deposit 100 is easiest to do with titan with skullfort if solo, if not just lfg a 4 stack and feed all motes to 1 guy. for light vs light, equip wardcliff and heavy ammo finder + hog the power ammo and invade every chance. if you're lucky someone will be using super on primeval and you can 1 shot him.

Is this better than running 5x paragon mods and dynamo/distribution?

I wish I could spend that long on it! I got to the part with the void charges with the two wizards and knight and gave up lol

We got the brexit fuckers who have lunas and shit but dont play the objective and then we got the no brexit fuckers who camp heavy and walk in groups cause they cant solo kill.

You should make one about shaxx because that would be amazing 
---
The EU: Not Forgotten :D
---
I only need to reset infamy and 6 more kills while people are in their supers which pisses me off that its a things since its pure rng at that point. Since most save their super for primeval. Hopefully my strategy of invading while there well is down so that they hopefully use their super works.

If you had the Curated Roll from Shax on a Dust Rock Blues then yes that‚Äôs thee perfect roll. There are only 2 factors to look at. This is the only Shotgun that can roll with opening shot and slide shot. It still takes away Recluse or Lunas Howl. However with a very good service revolver [God Roll](https://gyazo.com/0f8c56ad863f2eac386699779b57c8cd)  I can assure you this wishbringer is a monster even more so than [My Mindbenders Ambition ](https://i.gyazo.com/c26ffb14d72e935305c7c1bfdf10c0a0.png)

I would say your overthinking it but coming from star wars where the music gives hints into what the scene is about makes me second guess it.

Yeah, destiny is a PVE game with some PVP elements.

The pic should be the opposite. PVE is constantly being hurt by changes made for PVP. 
---
What could kill destiny?
---
Halo if they ever decided to turn that into a looter shooter.  And this is not likely every, but it would be an interesting endeavor for them to explore.  But its all about branding.  Destiny has the benefit of being one of the first and therefore, the longest main stay of the genre.  Halo could definitely steal the reigns if they ever decided to do this.
---
Anthem is garbage.  Period.  If Anthem were actually a good and playable game, it might actually give Destiny a run for its money.  But, Anthem is a dumpster fire.  BW was definitely onto something, but the execution of it all just isn't there.
---
Division is a good game, but runs into the problem of it not being a very stylish game.  As compared to something like Destiny and even Anthem... Division's overall design I can see as being off putting as compared to something like Destiny.  If Division was a space aged game like the rest, it would probably be winning more people over.

I never usually pass the orb around during the Sedia fight because one orb can take out her shield fully. It usually always spawns on the left and she teleports to the right so I just yeet that shit to get rid of her shield immediately.

hairy lines, lack of proper shading, You have two subjects yet the weapons are more realized and rendered.

Even if you're going for a more dark style only showing the outline your contour is so hairy. And it feels like each element is separate and doesnt meld together with the background at all.

THAT WOULD MY BE MY SPICY RAMAN!!! . I DID NOT KNOW I COULD SELL SHADERS FOR  BRIGHT DUST, AND WAS TRYING TO GRIND FOR ENOUGH TO GET THE RAMAN BEFORE THE NEW SEASON. I ALSO THOUGHT THAT ONCE IT WAS IN THAT ROW OF STUFF TO GET, IT WOULD STAY THERE. I HAD A million shaders  ! ANY WAYS ..just a post about nothing.     stay BRIGHT gaurdians !!

it makes sense if they want those shekels. there'll be a higher number of people buying it than an optional expansion. just look at how many people don't have the annual pass content. releasing a new game means they pretty much have to buy it unless they're happy replaying a game that won't get updated anymore.

If you dissociate and squint a bit at a sketch or drawing and the color density is very uniform (looks like a single shade/brightness) then you likely are not using enough contrast. Typically this stems from learning artists not using enough dark hues or heavy shading. Dont be afraid of laying on the black for lining and shading. Hold any object towards a window or lamp, say an apple (classic example) and you'll realize that one edge gets very close to white or the color of the light source and the other drops into a harder line of darkness. It's easy to be apprehensive with laying down heavy dark accents as it's harder to correct mistakes, but the effect of adding depth in contrast will improve your work a whole lot. Keep drawing!

No way to tell, but I'm excited. I'm not saying Activision was to blame for everything that Destiny 1/2 did wrong, but I *am* saying that I'm much more comfortable with Bungie making the mistakes than with Activision making them. Bungie needs to make money, but they want to do it making the game(s) they intended. Activision is just interested in the bottom line.

How to obtain: 
---
Step 1: Get all exotic weapons
---
Step 2: Dismantle all exotic weapons (will receive quest ‚ÄòAll for one‚Äô upon completion)
---
Step 3: Get 500 Void/Solar/Arc Hand cannon precision kills in the competitive playlist. ( Non precisi√≥n kills, non hand cannon kills, deaths, and assists all lower progress. Backing out of a match when the player queue suddenly goes up by 4 lowers progress. Playing the objective lowers progress.
---
Try 156 clears with no 1kv
---
Thanks I really appreciate that
---
Holy shit, you are right, thanks a ton!
---
That could indeed have been the case. I only released a few shots, then immediately switched. It might be that the initially uncovered enemies got good bow shots and later I overdrew or released too quickly as they ducked out of cover quicker.
---
That is great news, now I can sleep peacefully.

I hate all these so much. They are disgusting to look at.

Trace Rifles are nice.

It doesn't matter if they like it. That shows how many are playing what. **That** is all that matters because those numbers have been consistent for ages.

That‚Äôs genius!

Wtf. I have that roll. It isn‚Äôt masterworked tho. What‚Äôs the barrel option?
---
We're in the same boat then
---
I would keep it. But I'm just a casual so probably not listen to me. To be fair, everything with outlaw is a god roll to me.
---
but spectral blades are the real cancer of this game
---
I‚Äôll use it until I get my Luna‚Äôs
---
I would of probably quit by then :/
---
Thanks kind stranger, legend behavior 
---
Yeah but that doesn‚Äôt have the range advantage or the multikill potential (# of kills with one shot)

Im sorry if this is off topic but are there any clans/groups out there that can help people dive into raids?

You'll have time to hit max level, see it increased to 750, reach 750, play through all the content (new and old) , get bored and D3 STILL won't be out yet.

After I killed him with snipers only, I proceeded to go in with swords and shotguns and rush the bastard everywhere. Didn't know what hit him he was running scared.
---
573? This video is either really old, or you casual as fuuuuuuck

You get an obsidian thingy as a drop, then you exchange that with Ada for the actual thing that goes on your gun. So you need to get the drop from completing a forge in Bergusia first. 
---
PISS OFF GHOST
---
Valid points. It honestly baffles me how easy it is to dupe consumers by just making a new numerical entry. For some reason releasing a ton of updates and content still has people saying "they ruined Destiny I won't play D2" but if D3 hits they'll "give it a shot". I think most people are happy enough with where D2 is though. If we see D3 I hope it's at least got all the patrol zones from 1 and 2 to start haha.
---
If you want to play other opponents of the same skill level play competitive. Quick play is quick play let it be quick play. Also saying "balance your goddamn weapons" doesnt contribute to anything. Be specific about changes you believe will make the crucible more enjoyable for everyone.
---
Or you could just use J√∂tunn
---
Done :) good luck everyone!
---
Ah ok. Not seen one yet but only done about 10 Bergusias

Took me 2 days of solo competitve to get recluse. But  then again I am a pvp player with quite a bit of time on crucible. I'd suggest getting your HC headshots and solar kills before you try to rank up. Shouldnt take longer than around a week if you really try for it.

clearly, the only way to obtain this weapon is to throw every masterworked exotic in the entire world off of zavala's wall, then solo the entire leviathan with no weapons.

I'd buy that for a dollar.

FIGHT FOREVER GUARDIAN

It‚Äôs the (second) most Quake or Tribes-like interaction in the game lol. First being two Mountaintops, but like, that means you have to use get and use Mountaintop
---
Or you could not be lazy and put effort into making your posts look nice instead of looking unprofessional and annoying to look at?
---
our RNG is so random you get things you already have
---
Yes.
---
Vault of glass is hands-down my favorite part of any game. 
---
Tell me your secrets. My suckage is great. 
---
Not in reckoning 
---
You can get a better roll than the curated from a rep package with Vanguard just by doing Strikes &amp; stuff and turning in the tokens, you don‚Äôt even have to get the special one in order for it to show up in the loot pool.
---
How the hell do you aim with that thing?
---
Gotta use direct screen capture man, no photos of screen
---
Removing this sorry man.

If you haven't finished the mini quest line for gambit prime, it won't show up. You have to finish that first. Hope this helps.

As a dedicated gamer in my mid 40s I‚Äôve played it ALL. Since pong and the 2600 it‚Äôs been a part of my life. Destiny is the only game I play and have time for any longer. Not only is it my favorite game but prob my favorite media in general. I hope it never dies and continues to grow like WOW.

Jesus christ accurate

I see super good advice in there 
---
No off topic posts sorry man. 
---
Gotta remove this.

I get that in under two hours just by playing and stocking up on enhancement cores

Stuff like this is why there really should be an official ‚Äúticket submission‚Äù that puts you in direct, person-to-person contact with real customer support. Major glitches/mistakes are admittedly rare but there‚Äôs got to be a way to address them when they do happen beyond posting in a public forum. A multi-million $$ game with hundreds of thousands of players (granted now Bungie is more independent they may not be worth as much but they‚Äôve never had a good system) should have dedicated customer service.

What kind of company perma-bans people with absolutely no way to dispute it? And not even an acknowledgement of the cause of the ban? Tisk tisk bungie 
---
(P.s. please don't ban me, thanks) 
---
Year 1 gjallarhorn is still probably better though.
