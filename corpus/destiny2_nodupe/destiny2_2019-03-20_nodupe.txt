Didn't do anything like this, but during a countdown match using a devour warlock, managed to win the round killing the 4 opponents after the rest of my team were killed. I hate pvp, but damn did I feel good after pulling that off.

&gt; which includes the annual pass
---

---
The store shows 3 variants. Digital deluxe edition, Forsaken + Annual pass bundle and Forsaken standard edition. I mean if I buy the standard edition the annual pass is not included, right? Since it's almost an extra 25$ and running till august, I wanted to know if the annual pass will be worth the money. And thanks for the reply. Really appreciate the help. 
---
Some people are hoping destiny 3 is just an expansion to destiny 2 instead of a separate game. Probably won’t be the case though. The game is worth it if you like the grind. I don’t think it would matter if you missed season 1. The seasons revolved around each DLC and brought new gear, missions, locations, and mostly cosmetic items. I’m still getting previous season cosmetics in season 6. I got a transmat effect for my ship from season 2 over the weekend. 
---
The annual pass contains 3 mini expansions. You need it to be able to do forges to get black armory gear. You may need it to play gambit prime, but I’m not sure on that. The third mini pack isn’t out yet. They also have exotic quests that you can’t do with the pass. They keep bringing back old guns and the quests are challenging but you get an awesome weapon afterwards.

Use D2 app, Discord, PS4 communities or Subreddits.
---
I wouldn't say this subreddit is one for looking for fireteams. 
---
*Our idea
---
$200 cosmetics?  Hopefully never.
---
I never played the original Destiny either, but Detsiny 2 is in a good spot right now. 
---
The annual pass is all end game only, so if you aren't sure if you'll be playing **a lot**, I don't think you need to buy it now. I think the best strategy would be to buy the base game + Forsaken (all pre-annual pass DLC is bundled together with Forsaken), and then if you later on want it, buying the annual pass when it next goes on sale.

His reasoning is kind of understandable, he was using two hand canons and he got some unlucky spawns. 
---
I didn’t farm him or anything he was just in my way.  But in all honesty shotguns are kind of nutty, I wish the other close range weapon types were more effective.
---
i cant stop thinking "hot pocket" sounds like something that happens before sex.
---
Both very valid questions. Bungie doesn't go here, but in the other subreddit a Bungie employee commented that the BA frames are supposed to be on a random rotation, but the randomizer doesn't seem to be working. So hopefully it will be fixed soon. 
---
*Every single week* Strange Terrain is not the nightfall, everybody complains about how there isn't Strange Terrain, so I am ambivalent about that one being up for so long. What we really need is The Corrupted, though. 
---
I do believe they're a problem, but making them Bladedancer defeats their purpose. You're supposed to be stealthy, I think the speed of it needs to be slower, and the light attack damage needs to be toned down to at least a 2 hit. 
---
I would say if you have some extra money, go for the one that includes the annual pass, as it just adds more things to do and weapons to get, which is always great. However, if for whatever reason it isn’t in the budget, you wouldn’t be missing too much if you weren’t to get the annual pass. Personally I was in the same boat, I just started working and had to save for everything and had to consider if everything was worth the money, and I have definitely got more than enough content for what I paid for.
---
If you use hand cannons in gambit then yes 
---
Damn that's sleek. You could blind an enemy in the crucible with all that shine. 
---
 
---
I’m getting the same thing. Freaked me out when I checked my pursuits. 
---
I say this every week, and sadly it has become tradition, but: 
---
Horrors Least would be nice. 
---
I didn’t get mine to about my 15th powerful frame. It’s worth it when it drops though! 
---
[removed]
---
one word: Mayhem
---
*shivers*
---
Thanks!
---
Title? 
---
Good time to drop. Reckoning is arc this week
---
An experience, from early rumors of bungies next game to now. Epic lore immerses me in a way only TES and Fallout have. 
---
p 3@×5.. 
---
It's a 180 HC meaning it's competing against the Service, and Trust. Both of which can roll not rampage. For a gun that base 4 taps to the head, rampahe isn't going to be doing much. Anything you can do with ikelos, you can do better with either of the other 180 HC.
---
I’m an arcstrider main, and I don’t have any problems with spectral blade users. A well timed block followed up with a heavy swing or a heavy palm attack disposes of them pretty well.
---
Definitely still worth the grind. I’d also recommend Threat Level, it’s the BA shotty.
---
impressive
---
Emote is better since you get a third person camera view, and can whip out your shotgun super fast out of it anyways.
---
Jotunn is amazing, but you only get 2 chances a week per character. It can only drop when completing a powerful weapon frame at burgusia forge. Good luck!
---
Enhancement cores died for this.
---
Appreciate it. Just wasn’t sure if it was a limited time thing like Thunderlord.

I'm on PC

I just turned on some good music got in a party with some close friends and we just slayed out in gambit for a whole weekend

It’s a perfect paradox actually haha

My friend thinks I’ve become evil since I got the title, so what if I like taking guardians down like a cat playing with live food.
---
There’s layers to this meme. I approve.

There are Destiny model rips?? Oh shit, this could be fun
---
As a gun, it was better than BJ but it’s playstyle required not using a super and not using a super is not cool. 
---
Long reign Bungie

At least U can farm it ur’s. Mine I have to wait till the night fall strike come out to even able to farm it &gt;.&lt; one time I farmed for a whole week none stop every night and couldn’t even get the rocket drop. While all my other friend( 6 of them) got it in like first or 3rd run. And they don’t even need or want it!!!!!

I added more books to the list.

An idea? **OUR** Idea!

Upon further thought I think I know what may have happened in my case. Assuming my memory serves me, the Tartaras gaze is the frame you are rewarded for unlocking the Izinagi (or was it Gofannon, I forget doesn’t really matter) forge. I ended up unlocking the forge immidiately before a weekly reset, and therefore the storyline copy of that frame was never finished as it was removed on the reset. I’m thinking that the game may have gotten confused by the fact that I never completed the first instance of the Sniper Rifle powerful frame that I received, and so when I actually completed an instance of the frame it freaked out a bit. Or maybe it has some other cause. I’m planning on doing a play through on a new character in the next while, so I might test this on them (miss the first frame and then try to do it later).

Same with Last Word. Ace of Spades is more generic but it still is really powerful, and I'm fine with semi-generic exptics every once in a while. But there are some like Vigilance Wing that feel overly-generic.

During a gambit prime match, curated verions of some of the weapons have a chance of dropping whenever you do something that also causes a synth to drop. [Here is a list](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/azlvsl/ways_to_get_gambit_prime_weapons_curated_and/)
---
This is a joke right? The most overpowered class in the game with some of the most broken exotic abilities that exist in d2?
---
This
---
Please elaborate further about how Titans are "the most overpowered class in the game with some of the most broken exotic abilities that exist in D2" and don't include One Eyed Mask cause it got nerfed.
---
"There is no such thing as innocence. Just varying degrees of guilt."
---
The suppression effect would be really cool to mess around with.  I don’t think the stacking damage would be crazy from a crucible point of view.  They could maybe make it like a tranq gun, where the suppression lasts longer and the gun gets one shot. 
---
Please elaborate futher cause I am truly clueless as to what these "broken exotic abilites" are
---
i didn't really design this with crucible in mind, more like a pve minor and major killer, potentially viable for boss damage
---
Awesome, now make it do its victory taunt.
---
Re-upload without the usernames visible please.

Something like what the most recent buff to GG is what I think would be best. Not something that completely changes the super (looking at you Spectral Blades/Gwisin Vest) but something that brings it into the fray. A buff that makes it just good enough to use, as long as you know how to use it well. Albeit, one has a hell of a lot of armor w/close quarters abilities and one does not have any armor and is ranged so I dunno how they’d work around that. You know what I’m getting at here though lol
---
What'd you say about my sailor moon guardian punk? Got a problem with that huh.
---
The fact that you are equating a special to a primary is really all the evidence you need. The simple fact of the matter is that luna and NF and recluse are the only guns that can activate lethal perks without even getting a kill, making them inherently stronger than all other 180's, which are already the strongest archtype of handcannons. Take recluse and mountaintop. Both are strong in their own right, arguably the strongest of their class. Yet you need a kill with another gun to make recluse shred and very good aim to dominate with the mountaintop. The luna/NF are the stronger than recluse and mountaintop simply because you don't need a kill for magnificent howl, and to add to that, you can even 2-tap if you play smart. Shotguns, fusions and snipers are meant to dominate their respective ranges, which is why they have less ammo. Also, those "scrubs" are people who spent a substenial amount of money on this game, and as the providers of the service we pay for, it would be concerning if customer complains weren't at least adressed. Personally I don't think that luna/nf need a big nerf. Make it exotic is a good idea. And maybe tone down Magnificent howl a little, but I do not think they need to be removed or anything. 
---

or simply do it the hard way and advertise when you are at the tower or in other public places. A more annoying way I've seen is just to invite everyone you see in game to your clan even if they are in one, just send them out.

I think you get 24 but I am not sure

wow thanks alot!

yeah, should be around that. Always get a couple after every encounter.

Did you read the title?

Thanks

This makes sense, I've taken it to crucible the the sights are just too narrow for me to use it efficiently, I'll have to try it out!
---
Boy, that is some awesome shit. Looks like the Vex is going to jump out of a mirror/portal.
---
Bring a scythe
---
1.- lower branch od dawnblade: high mobility, long duration, no need for exotic. (ophidian aspect is a good choice for exotic, starfire protcol maybe? tranversive steps?)
---
2.- top branch stormcaller: long duration, great melee, if you have the helmet (crown of tempest) is a really long super, high mobility.
---
3.- both nova bombs: shutdown enemy supers, great granades, a lot of exotics options. (skill of dire ahamkara, nezarecs sin, contraverse hold)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
im not a super fan of crucible, but thisare my top 3.
---
another "fun" options are:
---
mid branch arc  (im really bad for english names) and well of radiance.

nova warp is really bad right now, is short and really slow.

You have to get to the highest competitive rank, 5400 I think. Without a stacked team, you’re pretty much beating your head against a wall (other stacked teams) until you get lucky breaks to increase your rank. With a stacked team, you’re beating your head against matchmaking waiting for matches in the first place.
---
Yeah I had 3 characters fully leveled up during Y1 but I gave up once Forsaken released to focus only on my warlock and I definitely don’t have time to fully go through the whole Forsaken campaign + Black Armory ajd now Joker’s wild content with 2 more characters

I don’t see how I’m ever going to reach Fabled in competitive. I’m only at Brave II

Way to call me out in front of everyone

Replace “sniper” with “tractor cannon” and you’ve got my matches

this deserves zero upvotes
---
the synth recycling was only ever intended as an inventory management mechanic to get rid of stacks of synths you know you are never going to use
---
stop complaining about this and learn to read the patch notes
---
why not just read the patch notes before making stupid memes about things that are not actual problems
---
Looks like a hydra
---
You realise you could put synths in your vault if you're running out of space, they could have also made the stack sizes bigger.
---
yeah he says it before the transmat fires, he says "you ever tried to eat a hive knight? that's the sort of questions you gotta ask yourself out on the frontier"
---
I've never actually used it in gambit was just a powerful drop from my last game but yes definitely needs a buff
---
you keep saying that as if this mechanic somehow undermines that in any way
---
stop whining
---
Were we in the same game? Had one like this too
---
exactly what i thought
---
Then why is it hardly used, or barely recommended?
---
Lots of Ikelos in PvE, and Parcels or Mindbenders in PvP.
---
capitalism is just wealth sword logic. The traveler demands collective ownership of the MoP.
---
Transversive Steps probably, between that burst glide and Icarus Dash you got yourself a decently agile Warlock and it takes people by surprise
---
This is awesome!
---
One day it will be clear. Then you'll be like "really?! WTF!", and we'll all share a good laugh.
---
5500 is max, I think Legend starts at 5400
---
In all fairness I told them I hadn't done it before! 
---
That's scout's in a nutshell in D2 though. I'll get around to it eventually. 
---
Yeah I guess there is the whole triumph thing from the start if you played D2 on the same platform as D1, so you’d have to be the same guardian in that case. I guess yeah, they just wanted a catch 22 for both groups
---
just get a 4 stack 4head
---
First your work is very good. I did notice the lighting inside there, and its good also.
---
What is happening (for me at least) is that the shield is set far enough back that it no longer looks like a card.. and, again this is just my opinion, the back is where you sell the idea that it is a card.
---
Take it for what it is, a measley .02 worth  of opinion. No harm, no hate intended.. just a different perspective thats all
---
Ishtar Commander Master Race
---
I’ve only gotten invaded with 15 twice, both times were with my friends, and both times I banked milliseconds before dying lmfao. Aside from that I only get 15 if I wipe a wave or take out an HVT, and if I do, I bank right away. Those two times I just didn’t notice/was waiting for others to bank 2 or more.
---
Lockdown is FarmVille when you're in a 4 stack
---
I'm the type of player who's right behind the first 2 idiots backing them up even though they are making bad moves because teamwork is more important than my KD if I want to get that tasty win. That's not rushing in a straight line it's taking a smart position and throwing in some shots to give them a fighting chance
---
Keep your team alive as much as you can they are much needed pressure on the other team
---
Easy for some. Thorn can be very time consuming for some. TLW can be difficult for some.
---
Hitting a bullseye or trip 20 in darts is easy for me. Some people can't even hit the board reliably, let alone a number they are aiming at.
---
If I told someone like that to get 10 bullseyes, it would be time consuming for them but they eventually do it by Billings lick of nothing else.
---
If I told them they had to get 10 bullseyes and every 2 misses took one away, it would be hard for them. 
---
For me, it would be easy. A lot of things in life are relative. Understanding that can lead to actually having empathy for others.
---
oof
---
I'm on the void hand cannon step any tips 
---
I want SYLOK THE DEFILED 
---
You made it clear, I'm saying that there has to be a line somewhere past which it is *too* prohibitive--you wouldn't lock lore behind the top 1% of Trials Winners, would you?--and this crosses it.  Hell, Thorn ain't even what it used to be, as far as "good endgame weapons" are concerned.
---
How do you view the numbers?
---
I believe you have to aim down sights to get the tracking to kick off, I only seem to get tracking if I treat it like box breathing.  If I blind fire I am usually waiting for them to round a corner.
---
They are Period!
---
P.s. I used to suck at PvP and started grinding, grinding and grinding to get better, learn the maps and use of radar, plus what weapons work for me. If you suck at PvP and whine about it, then pull your shit together and improve your game! This shit is meant to be hard. Otherwise, we would complain about missing content anyway
---
Ah, I am a hunter and she told me not to stand on the screen lol. 
---
I ain’t lmao, I couldn’t care less about the gun, but I’m not selfish and can see where other peoples displeasure lies. 
---
Teamwork is moving strategically together not ignoring the situation to play follow the leader. Even in this worst case (los gained down the scope of a sniper) first guy gets headshot. Guys 2 3 and 4 see that and move together to close ground on a flank while keeping an eye on their radar and each other while 1 hopefully respawns behind them.

---
The bad thing about bubble is that it prevents you from putting damage out effectively. Running banner shield and doom fangs has worked wonders for me, and when someone popped a bubble it just threw everything off and most people stayed outside of it. 
---
Banner shield has the ability to produce tons of orbs of light from damage absorbed and shield throws both. The doom fangs extend duration with shield throw kills, and there’s shadow thrall EVERYWHERE. I’ve had my super hold through two sections of the bridge on multiple occasions.
---
Having the ability to melt the bigger dudes can be extremely important depending on which enemy it is. The only one that seems to give issue for me is the knight with his big dumb fire, but a warlock with well of radiance can negate that, as well as a bit more attentiveness (which I can lack sometimes). 
---
Alternatively, are you running the helm of saint-14? It might blind any big bois that walk into your bubble. Haven’t tried myself so I can’t say.
---
Using commander means your DPS on oryx is gunna depend solely on your loadout, but don’t be afraid to use it to clear adds or buff your teams dps if you’re outta everything but primary.
---
If it’s the alak-hool knights or whatever  they’re called, you gotta hold your ground when you’re shield blocking. Stand DIRECTLY in front of them and defend. As long as they don’t move past you, their attack won’t register past your shield. The light well and your banner buff will let your team do some good damage. Was getting 999999 per shot last week with Jotun and banner without the well of radiance. Shits crazy, and that’s just from the explosion.
---
Only if they nerf it first 
---
The problem with that part is that you can hide in the spawn point but then you're going to be like fish in a barrel if they're using a super or rocket launcher etc. You're best spreading out and actively trying to take out the invader, although like I said, hiding behind a rock could make the difference between a loss and a win. 
---
Hey, not everyone is rich. Money is money, doesn't matter if it's a buck or two unless you are a millionair.

I dont know why you feel the need to berate people inline personally. Address the situation as a whole, but no need to be an asshole.

If there is one think the Drifter made sure we know, it's that the Drifter survives. He's such an interesting and complex character. I love that his backstory lets us have discussions like this.
---
Ok 🤷‍♂️ 
---
Are you serious? Dude people wont shut up about this. It get posted every 30 damn minutes. 
---
Run a void subclass along with Ikelos HC, Kindled Orchid, or Cold Sweat. Only play comp. Hang back when you see enemies on your Eddie and aim for the head. 
---
Just my personal opinion, I have those matches in comp where I get put against a 4 stack, or I play extremely well but still lose. It feels unfair, but I understand what the game is 
---
Cup. Keep it to one syllable. 
---
I just tweeted the community manger about this yesterday. No response. 
---
Sorry but this just doesn't happen often in games with decent MMR like Overwatch. Yes, a team of 4 communicating is going to have an obvious advantage, but it is worse on D2 because you get paired with people who are of no where near your skill level.
---
If it ez why you only just got there 1 1/2 months later
---
That would be interesting, but I can't see how that would work
---
And then he loses the motes!
---
If you haven’t read the Thorn lore book yet, go do that, then come back. Alternatively someone in this thread explained it so if you want the short version go read that.
---
I've definitely killed 2 enemies with one shot before, and was again confused.
---
Bruh..Drifter has caused the deaths of fellow Guardians, he only cares about himself and will abandon us and the city when given the chance. As he's done multiple times in the past
---
Aunor is right to be weary of the Drifter. If I saw a dude using the darkness and convincing Guardians to join him, I'd immediately view him as a major threat to the city.
---
I don't really get all the hate for Aunor. She's investigating any possible threats linked to the darkness against the city and I guess that's a big no no for people
---
Meanwhile the Drifyer is literally telling you to keep your head in the sand and just trust everything he says...puhhhleasseee lol
---
It's datamined lore that people are talking about, but without the datamined lore, that's what we're lead to believe.

Ah ok

Shin is actually a Shadow of Yor who is trying to harness the dark for good.

Maybe in the twab tomorrow they will let us know. It is due.

No I said passive for simplicity and as contrast to the reckless blueberry it's no criticism, my point is simply that its no use to lament that your team isn't making a smart play, you either try to communicate what you want them to do or you try to mitigate the damage of their bad plays

Everyone pressed up against the Gambit glass
---
Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding
---
Didn't the dude start banging a trannie?
---
1) Cayde was fine with Gambit and the Drifter, and even helped develop Gambit.
---
2) The Vanguard said the Drifter was ok to stay in the tower, it’s Aunor who has basically gone rogue and is accusing him and wants him gone.
---
3) If the Drifter did kill Cayde I’ll be in the perfect position to put a bullet through his brain when I find out.
---
Hi, just a message to let you know this post has been removed as your question has been answered.
---
Have a great day!

I like this analogy. TLW quest was plenty rage inducing but after I completed it I felt accomplished. That’s really what it’s all about. As for the Thorn I learned to like crucible even in the state that it’s in, and a major reason why I’m still playing. I think grinding for exotic weapons are MORE fair than getting lucky with rng. 
---
Calm down Satan!
---
I found the Hunter. But i’ve also gotta ask, how’d you type this with Luna’s Howl in one hand and Parcel of Stardust in the Other? 
---
I want the Apache dance back
---
I want hammerhead so bad😂
---
I agree with everything except spectral being balanced. Its busted, please adjust
---
Taken Psions will carry the effect onto both of the split bodies - and they'll both create remnants on death, regardless of how many permutations. This is unusual since Psion permutations don't count for kills/multikills. The Devourer effect may behave differently to that which we've seen before - as apparent by the way it can damage a Taken Blight via burn just by shots to it's barrier.
---
Shoulder charge with lag comp etc is annoying still. Yesterday I got shoulder charged in comp by a guy that was entirely under me. He never even came up to my height he was under me the whole time. Apparently if you're directly under the shoulder charge can still hit. Not to mention that the audio for the shoulder charge didnt play either so
---
DIM honestly makes the game better
---
There a couple of unique encounters in this version of the strike, the boss fight being one of them. It's a different boss and in a completely different area than the normal strike. Not much cover.
---
I would describe myself similar to you...a decent player not wanting to waste a bunch of time dying/respawning. Based on that, I'd say take at least one other with you. I 2-manned it with a buddy and it was still a pretty tough challenge.
---
Marten? Yeah, he got a new gf who still had a dick.
---
Blaming others for your own failures is not really a video game tactic? It's just being a shitty person.
---
Ah, scorn blood, Drifter's favorite. 
---
Same lol i grab motes asap without reading my teammate's mote count
---
Seriously. 
---
this isn't really a "New Gambit Prime map" at all. It's just allowing the maps to freely join both game modes, prevents the exclusivity and boring-ness of two maps. Nor is it a "copy paste" - it's a different variant of the same game mode on a map - by this logic is every PVP map a copy-paste when it's used for a different PVP game type? Gambit Prime was given 1 week per new map, so current Gambit maps being introduced into Prime are getting the same treatment and once all Prime maps have been experienced Gambit Prime will be all maps.
---
For the ghosts killing guardians thing it's likely he's talking about the old Warlords' ghosts. They weren't real nice folks overall so I doubt there ghosts were either. It possible there are still some rather ruthless lightbearers out there with ghosts to match.

Dude, this is crazy awesome!
---
That’s my situation.
---
Big agree. 
---
A lot of the people here dont follow it. Id rather not just have Bungie begging threads. I come to reddit for the memes mostly.
---
Lol blue weapons are God tier
---
Chal.
---
pc
---
Or if you're Quebecois "Chalice chalise"
---
Eh, exotics aren’t very exciting once you have them all and are already close to max light
---
The subreddit tells me they don’t have user flair enabled
---
Agreed, Black Armory aesthetic is really nice
---
If only there was something over player's heads that said how many motes they have....
---
I see
---
10 runs are.. not many to begin with. At all.
---
Coming from someone whos half decent in PvP, it's the most infuriating shitshow.
---
I smashed my 130$ Razor Death Stalker keyboard and had to replace it...
---
Fo shizzle ma nizzle
---
Doesn't it say when using arc melee or something like that 
---
I have run it with people who did it on first or even 5th try, it can be disappointing and the same with Riven runs though I have way more then 10 for that one.
---
Now I want a remix of [this](https://youtu.be/428IyxSfsls) with the word dinosaurs replaced by nova bomb / solo ulted.
---
Yeah, I knew it was a different boss, but the cover thing is not ideal, lol. I assume there's a restriction on respawning?
---
pal, we got shin malphur, the shadows, a buncha dark weapons, all that on our side. ya'll got an angry warlock order. brotha, yer'a dead man walkin'.
---
Make sure that she is actually enjoying destiny 2 and not playing it just to spend time with you. Good luck tho :-)
---
Tbh I joined drifter in search of power to defend the city with. What worries me is what he says after completing his allegiance quest so idk if I’m still super cool with the drifter 
---
bring a god damn thorn
---
ContraPoints, hell yeah!
---
I like to say “Drinking mug”
---
I'm getting up there as well. Sitting at 43 rn
---
I actually like walking up to them slowly. 
---
How do I get the thorn quest?
---
Didn't even have to be precision, it was that best.
---
Good luck guardian
---
It one shots in crucible and it five shoots the ultras in the chasm of screams
---
Why starve your enemies when you can starve your own people.
---
Play rumble. Took a few rounds for me and i suck at pvp lol. Good luck
---
So just stand and wait for the portal to be open?
---
I actually did get a few invader synths after I did some other stuff (banking like two small blockers, killing a few enemies and blockers)
---
The system of the synths should be more consistent.
---
There's no reason that a player who banked a lot of motes will get a synth that doesn't reward his play style
---
*Trying to get your 3rd mote in Gambit when your teammate has 14*
---
FTFY - sincerely, every blueberry in Gambit. 
---
Thankyou! Its a great weapon IMO :)
---
I’m never scrapping this one 
---
Except it's a PvE game with PvP as an extra activity. Maybe if they treated PvP as a proper main mode with proper updates then people wouldn't hate it so much, but they don't.
---
By your logic, then all PvE quests and items should be so insanely grindy that no PvP player bothers to touch them and only gets to use weapons from shaxx. But they're not, all PvE quests are simple and straight forward and take a fraction of the time it takes to complete a PvP quest. I never had to grind a PvE quest, ironically. I completely them coincidentally while doing weeklies before jumping back into gambit/crucible.
---
These PvP quests aren't even more difficult than the PvE quests(exception being the mountaintop triumph), they just take way too long. In a game mode that's already boring to most people, they want you to use one weapon type over and over and over. So not only do you need to spend more time, you have to do it in a boring way.
---
duel wield last word in one hand and thorn in the other. but how to reload...
---
Not from a Hunter
---
Charge her 100000 glimmer instead. 
---
You don't need to rush the experience, you can play 2-3 matches today and finish it later if you feel bored.
---
That's great that you are being so understanding.
---
Wait a minute is she on this subreddit, does she know your username,  have I ruined the suprise?
---
Motes. People don't fucking deposit their motes. You're triggering me right now, just saying.
---
I don't know, if the GIF reflects OPs feelings they may indeed feel like getting "Thorn-ed"
---
Mmmmmkay
---
Noted. 
---
This is the curated roll https://ibb.co/cbk9ymn
---
I have it and I haven’t used IKelios since. Occasionally i’d pull it out if I can’t use my TL. 
---
Completely worth it. 
---
ALMOST ENUFF DAKKA 
---
Damn, you didn't even get the "Well, well, well" triumph for killing the whole team standing in the well, or have you already gotten that?  
---
Either way, I think it's bugged cause I got it the other day for killing one enemy standing inside it.  
---
This was such a weird show when I watched it awhile back lol 
---
"finish up later" for most people means never being able to finish it.
---
Played 2 matches of rumble when the quest came out. 30 kills and only 9% progress with a void HC. That's asinine. 
---
This is the weeb trash content I live for
---
\*Broda
---
It takes me less time to finish a pinnacle pvp weapon than the strike one. I finished TLW pvp step in 2 games, faster than the wizard ritual step or the final mission. 
---
This idea that Destiny is a “pve game” is false. Yes, it has a lot of pve elements. But it was designed to include pvp from the start. It is a PvX game, plain and simple.
---
There’s a cheese spot above the infrared figure at the boss. Hide in that crevis and peak to shoot. Watch out for the witches that go around in the later phase. Just kill them and end him. 
---
I think the toughest part is going to be the elevator. 
---
So it was 3 of you to protect him... but you failed, so I would say facepalm on you
---
So is $48 a good price for all of it?
---
literally just look them up on raid report to see if they have clears. Takes few min to screen through the LFG people and the outcome is much smoother runs
---
“Another senseless death...”
---
*aggressive guitar noises*
---
Yes I meant to comment directly but accidentally commented on the post of it. To me it is very much worth it 
---
Okay. I’m getting right now. Thank you for the help.
---
It does kill fast at really far ranges, I’ll give you that. I feel like a recoil increase might help with reducing its effectiveness at range. 
---
Sippy cup
---
Yeah I know right. The no thumb chimpanzees that wonder this sub think that Titan shoulder charge is the most OP ability in the game but their fine with spectral blades lasting the whole match. Really makes you wonder. 
---
It’s weird. With sunbreakers shoulder charge I always hit my target but with shield bash I always miss. I don’t know why they don’t have the same code for both. 
---
This sub still does on the regular though. 
---
Titan is best for charging in guns blazing, warlock is best all around and Hunter is good for montages
---
I’m thinking between Titan and Warlock.
---
Clench your cheeks and scream. You'll get pegged by not forgotten and lunas often. Every win is points every loss is subtracted. I gave up, im happy with ny 21% delirium 
---
I hate the grind so much but I need that smg and pocket rpg-I mean grenade launcher
---
So any hit marker with your smoke is reloading tlw?
---
You’re wrong. Shoulder charge can kill a warlock in a rift and go through a Titan wall too. Hunters do not need an even stronger neutral game to counter the only one hit ability that titans have. Hunters already have the best neutral in the game. 
---
*le deflect
---
Nope
---
it’s wide
---
Don’t make me cry
---
Honestly tho if I didnt know my teammates any better, u would've thought so too. Also it was just that round.
---
😭 this is beautiful and a super creative/thoughtful way to propose. I’d deadass cry if my future girlfriend or boyfriend proposed to me this way
---
For my hunter: poker (by electric light orchestra)
---
Fast and exciting but willing to risk it all 
---
For my titan : Danger ahead (electric light orchestra)  stunning birth you can never catch with a hint of impending danger as days till by
---
Yep. That’s the issue for me as well. 
---
Yep i do now but thats not exactly the point, the point is make them re attainable or dont even make them lose-able in the first place ( still dont understand why they did that.)
---
Having a full invader gambit prime set is like being matt.
---
Destiny Item Manager has a review system that might help you see what's absolutely trash (I can't remember what ratings out of 5 positive, neutral and negative are, but you can find it in settings). You can also look at the perks for all your gear using it. For stuff that you can't decide, take a look at /r/sharditkeepit.
---
I second that. I like following instructions even though he keeps calling me snitch but I'll overlook that.
---
it's not a matter of which mode you're playing, that part is clear, but the terminology for ranks that are apparently mode specific. Either way, no it isn't "hard" to hover over play modes, but yes it is still absolutely bad UI and UX
---
So awesome 👍
---
Dont quote me on this as I can’t find the source right now, but I’m pretty sure prime engrams can indeed proc exotic, but you get the exotic engram instead. So whenever you’re supposed to drop a prime engram, it would have a chance to give you an exotic instead. 
---
"We have such sights to show you!" Is all that comes to mind here. 
---
So there’s nothing I can do? Damn 
---
Same. It’s amazing
---
Ah that makes much more sense, might be how they actually random drop these days, would make sense how they have random perks on armor and how they always powerful 
---
Fuck you, its still broke. I'm blaming you personally for this failure.
---
it's gonna be arbalest
