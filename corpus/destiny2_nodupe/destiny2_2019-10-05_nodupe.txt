That‚Äôs the same thing with me, I‚Äôve always wanted it but I never went for it and now I can‚Äôt.

---
Have you tried uninstalling the game and reinstalling it?
---
We will probably get an ads sens before traction toggle lol.
---
Sell your game then. Yall mindset is so toxicating feeling like yall deserve something. Hell then i should deserve something since i played since the beta of d1. Nah but i dont because thats dumb and greedy logic. Bungies over here trying to push the destint franchise in a better direction in the midst of all these greedy ass games suckin the chicken off greedy suprise mechanic publishers, and yall want compensation lol thats like someone you know winning the lottery and you bugging em about that 1 time you gave em a cookie and that they should give you $1000000. You and all the other people who have the same mindset arent entitled to crap from bungie. They paid their dues when yall paid for the game and dlc. And the logic of getting shadowkeep for free do yall want to run bungie into the ground. They dont have a big suprise mechanic publisher to give them millions of dollars now. If anything yall should feel like that yall should support bungie in anyway possible if you actually like the game. If not get outta here because the moon's haunted and the killer robots are coming.
---
No, that's your mom, you're confused.
---
That makes me super sad...
---
Corsair right? Force update your mouse and IQUE and that will fix it.  IV had an m65 pro for years and it's a constant problem on destiny

Might I recommend Cheeto puffs for the legs

What are friends?
---
I've not talked to a single person that regrets purchasing a SSD upgrade. But go on being stubborn if you enjoy taking longer to load everything.
---
Yeah I just looked at my vault and I had two 0 light travelers chosen lol
---
It does not matter what forge you do. All weapons can be forged at any forge
---
where did you find the essence for the scout?
---
Yeah but I shouldn't be hitting 74s at 25 meters when I have memento mori active which btw that's inside handcannon range. I'm not mad with the changes they SAID were coming to handcannons, they said drop off would be more apparent and I was like  "that ain't no problem". But they lied and its blatantly obvious that they nerfed the range
---
I‚Äôll be amazed if anyone under 40 knows this.
---
I got one randomly from some legendary rewards
---
Huh? Just join each other
---
Plot twist: I'm 27
---
Let that be a lesson for those who come between a man and his finisher...
---
They said they were reducing the effect of the range stat, what else did you expect? Maybe it was too harsh but the nerf was needed.
---
Im not entirely sure...im new to the game myself.
---
This is so ridiculous and I love it.
---
What are you talking about? It‚Äôs an excellent feature.
---
We need more guardians like you
---
It's next to the fire pit where the Thorn chest was
---
Yeah, even the very first campaign from launch.
---
Shit someone finally realized how awesome I am, thanks dude
---
So if I get two teams of 3 together we can join each others raids?
---
I think if you cross save licenses might carry but I'm not sure.
---
Ok guys I think this worked for me. Basically I just kept playing until one prime engram dropped (it seemed like I didnt had the prime buff that makes them show but it dropped anyways) after a few minutes I checked again and they showed up, hopes this helps you too
---
What I want is finishers to ether not have the melee right before the move or to bind to the melee button
---
So I could be wrong. But I think your wrong.  Bad juju isn't a weapon of sorrow. Only thorn is.  Bad juju is not a weapon that was molded by partial hive ritual.  Only thorn is a weapon of sorrow.  I'm pulling this info from the hours and hours of byf videos iv watched.
---
The Special Finisher mod sort of makes a shortage of Special, like, *not a thing.*
---
I was shy on it until I realized I‚Äôd literally never run out of ammo.
---
what a great show
---
Titan: Punch is only way!  
---
Hunter: Here try this new handcannon.  
---
Titan: \*fires Eriana's Vow\* I CAN PUNCH FROM DISTANCE!
---
Welcome aboard the cool train brotha
---
The range nerf was nonsense.
---
It's.... Warlock is the way to go. Hunter and Titan revolve kind of heavily on melee.  In most subclass trees anyways.  Go find an older datto or aztecross video talking about subclasses of you want a really good explanation.
---
One of my main reasons I have never been and to complete a raid.
---
Are you going to quit Xbox altogether? If not, then a biiig NO. If you play the DLC on Xbox, Cross Save will let you keep what gear you got and still use the character on PC. Only get PC DLC if you‚Äôre full-swapping to PC
---
True
---
It's a legit DLC so closer to Last wish than a raid lair. But no exacts on length/ encounters.
---
Next up on Ow My Balls
---
Ive didnt play since drifters season ending and a bit of season of opulence. did i lose too much things? and will it take too much to catch up on the content?
---
I'm not missing the point.  Your mad because your hand cannons doesn't have stupid fucking range.  Trust me I see that.  All I'm saying is it's freed up other weapoms to shine and again... You can still three tap so shh.
---
I thought it was only lost oasis
---
This I don‚Äôt understand. I‚Äôm a returning player but I‚Äôm overwhelmed because I know I‚Äôve completed parts up the campaign but they‚Äôre all over the directory as if I should be competing them again.
---
If you think 30 meters is stupid range then you've been playing this game wrongüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
---
I just did the forge and was able to get the quest step. But through the map spot
---
World‚Äôs First 0 light Garden of Salvation run, I dare you

yes

Bold of you to assume my friends are still on Xbox and didn‚Äôt all leave me for pc

Is there a scout I didnt see it in the scout menu

The season passes included with the deluke edition are not shareable. Gotta buy your own at eververse, $10 a piece.
---
Me: Kills guardian in Crucible
---
Shaxx: *OHHH MY GOOOOOD HOLYYYYY SHIIIIIT*
---
didn't realize for cores. going down tho (infusing an exotic into a legendary) is much more expensive tho.
---
The innocent minds shall sleep no more
---
If you need even more evidence the drifter even says that it‚Äôs just like thorn
---
Nope still just costs one upgrade module.
---
Aw shame! Oh well thanks

Dude it works!!! Thank you lol this is going to save me so much time

Wait. So bungie did this on purpose? I‚Äôm new to D2 on pc and never used DIM
---
The highest gear score is 960. Your artifact can push that up
---
This is on mostly low settings ;)
---
Yo what handcannon is that?
---
Its in the ps store, i literally just checked.
---
Best part of playing Crucible is hearing Shaxx scream "YEESSSSSSSSSSSSS"
---
It got buffed when Shadowkeep dropped. Now it refills the magazine when you picked up ammo at all times, and it now fires 150 rounds before reloading.
---
Atleast your not far away from there...
---
Actually, he must be a friend to bees as he survived the impact... unfortunately, geometry and gravity decided they were not impressed.
---
That‚Äôs why they did it
---
Ok that definitely clears it up some. I still need to do some research but this is helpful.
---
Got them about an hour ago from the fated engram man
---
&gt;Haven't seen this talked about yet 
---
You definitely didn't use the search bar then.
---
It's been posted dozens of times already.

Marry me?

I'm at a loss as to why everyone's downvoting this. The copious amounts of vulgar bullshit names is just tiring at this point.

This isn't an LFG sub.

Lmao too bad you don't have a 0 light heavy. Alass, 0 power is not attainable by sinners like us hunter

Your toon looks a little like Sean Bean, that might be why. You‚Äôll  do a Benjamin Button and eventually be Power Level 0.

How do I get it as an existing player? Do I have to make a new character? I saw I could pick up the campaigns again for Red War, Osiris, etc, but not the vanilla/new light stuff???

How so? You basically pay the infuse cost ahead of time by buying these and they actually are cheaper than before (only one core instead of multiple to buy) and that is it really
---
Yes
---
How? You must have acquired it after SK?
---
More like shooting a tether at a boss only to have it barley miss and hit a wall 100 yards away, and then immediately fall off the map.
---
That's peak performance right there.
---
Gambit is the best part of Destiny 2 imo. Great game mode only let down by the communities apathy towards it result in people afking and just generally not understanding what to do.
---
It‚Äôs a blast to play with, surprised I don‚Äôt see it more.
---
If you notice an enemy fire team using a decent amount of arc weapons in crucible, switching to it mid-match can really be some fun too.
---
Yea that‚Äôs a good idea when I get some time I‚Äôll do some exploring there
---
Just gimme a quick Dempsey Roll and I'll be happy.
---
There's a post just above yours with someone having the same issue, must be a universal problem atm.
---
Wiatwaitwait i played forsaken since day 1, where does variks come in??
---
You have to unlock them from your modification tab in your inventory
---
Originally the intent was to be Severus Snape but yeah I see what you mean
---
Stunner.
---
Blues will give you a higher power level until 900 then it‚Äôs based of of your power level not counting the artifact
---
I got to 900 in a day and I don‚Äôt even own Shadowkeep. Literally just played crucible and three blues drop per game so it is really quick to boost up your light level
---
Need to wait for third
---
This is pretty much the reverse of what happened in revenge of the sith. 
---
Obiwan, I have the low-ground
---
You underestimated my power! 
---
Don't try it! 
---
(proceeds to jump down and gets obliterated)

You demon
---
optimacy ornament and prodigal gauntlets. I got the prodigal boots but the ornament doesnt work on those
---
In the Variks the Loyal lore books. He pulled the strings basically. He broke the barons and Uldren out. I highly recommend reading those books. Gives really goo insight on Variks thought process through the whole thing and what led him to that point.
---
Mcgruber finisher. Where you throw them off a cliff and then...
---
I want exotic finishers that use the supers equiped like golden gun, sentinel shield etc
---
I have no idea what is going on or what I‚Äôm meant to be doing. Finished D1 but refused to buy any DLC after all the shady practices and only got D2 now because it was free. The tutorial mission is literally copy pasted from D1, and I thought I had downloaded the wrong game at first. When you finish the tutorial from what I can gather from comments, the main story is skipped??? Why? There is no explanation as to what is happening and what to do. The first quest is just reach power level whatever. How? Am I actually meant to start the game by grinding random events?
---
Just infuse it?
---
Oh yes, I like this idea
---
Nose-air laugh
---
Everyone‚Äôs talking about the planetary mats, but for me it seems like the enhancement cores are the issue. I‚Äôm a new player but it seems like it will take me a long time to gather enough for master working
---
Ya I did haha
---
I‚Äôll take it
---
[deleted]
---
You start campaigns by talking to Amanda in the Tower now.
---
I just never particularly liked Cayde. He was just kinda annoying to me from day one D1.

One of the bonus bounties that you can get from Eris is to use a hand cannon on the moon, if you‚Äôre looking to have an excuse to use it (and want to make your experimental time more profitable).

Had a helluva match once where I got 157 kills in one round and 32 Guardian kills.
---
*And I still freaking lost.*
---
A lot
---
\*Underrated\*
---
You never see them in pvp and rarely in pve
---
F in the chat
---
Ahh so your a one eyed mask user I see now
---
How long was that match?
---
No probably 6 months, however it‚Äôs still my product I payed for, yet others don‚Äôt
---
Can I change server ?
---
I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised as well, and thank you üòä
---
Old item perks all still work exactly the same, so some people with VERY highly specialized armor sets are keeping them. If you don't have certain armor perk combinations that you really like, it's not worth keeping the armor, you should just use the new armor system instead. It will take more time investment to get into the new armor system, but supposedly it's more customizable.
---
I was for a bit but it quickly got outclassed and I don't want to burn upgrade cores too quickly
---
Like 20 minutes or so I think
---
You could‚Äôve to, you just didn‚Äôt buy it???
---
I mean as hunter it‚Äôs always fun to invisible with a shotgun
---
Well that was just uncalled for...
---
Lol
---
I dont think ive ever maxed out a Titan. Warlock master class.
---
Dann
---
Big fax. I hated that strike so much.
---
RIP i stopped doing pve in gambit and just focused on setting the other team back. At least if I do that randos I queued with might win
---
It only randomly drops if you actually do the questline
---
Unsure. There‚Äôs 3 plates in a triangular fashion. One by the tower where it says you lack something, down by the console on the upper platform by the landing pad where the fallen like to spawn. Run through the tunnel directly below you. There‚Äôs on top of the dome, and another through the tunnel. Now look on top of the tunnel you exited out of by the region chest and another bowl/plate looking thing is above you. There‚Äôs 3 plates and me and my friends have a feeling it‚Äôs related to that.
---
Did you pick up the quests from Amanda Holiday in the tower?
---
Oh, I see you're a warlock of culture as well 
---
(Although I don't agreewith your opinion over cayde)
---
Looks like you haven‚Äôt played for 2 years, spectral blades was a thing :)
---
Should have buy it a long time ago
---
The question is how do you define ready ‡≤†_‡≤†
---
For what it's worth, I'm finding masterworked items dropping much more often. I've gotten 3 in only about 12 hrs of play, you can dismantle those for shards. This is on top of gunsmith bounties of course, which are stupid easy. So it's way faster to get them than back in the Forsaken days imo. You'll get there!
---
Yeah I got confused too during the training mission already. There are these things that you are supposed to know like hitting the tab button to see way points etc. Also I had cinematics not play and then suddenly play so I got stuck at the old ship didn't know what to do or where to go after the enemy was defeated there. Seems like you kinda have to figure it out and looks like it will be fun when you get used to it :-)
---
Luna's Howl is "pain and guilt", I believe.
---
Get to wreck noobs in pvp?
---
Hate to hear your loss. But as far as I‚Äôm concerned that was about as worthless gear set to jump into this new DLC with at start. I deleted that crap 5 minutes into campaign
---
Awesome, thank you so much
---
Never seen it mentioned, my bad. First for me lol
---
PC Sorry, updated with this info
---
It will drop during other quest steps and works activities
---
Hey, we dont have to agree on it, bud. Thats just my $0.02. Which appears to be worth less than two cents...
---
I believe they are the winter event ornaments
---
But were the DM's you got inappropriate lol
---
On PC we have Prt Scr. On xbox and ps4 you have live video recording built into the console as an innate feature. So my question is, why is it still so hard to take screencaps?
---
Man, I am so glad to read this post. I thought I was the only one.
---
What platform are you on? I‚Äôm looking for someone for co-op.
---
As I understand it you get everything prior to Forsaken
---
That‚Äôs not really the best refund but it‚Äôs a great side effect
---
Actually, I received none
---
They‚Äôll open up after the raid tomorrow. Kinda like how the Dreaming City opened up once the Worlds First was achieved for the Laid Wish raid.
---
No, no, you're good! I definitely recommend trying it on the Oracle Engine or really any other moving platform. I can only think of that one elevator during an EDZ story mission as another moving thing off the top of my head
---
The riskrunner you get from that quest isnt powerful. At least it wasnt for me
---
A victory for reddit
---
Haven't played since Black Armoury first came out and was just wondering what some good weapons to aim for would be that're currently obtainable in game. Thanks in advance
---
So I am playing destiny 2, and I have 2 characters, a titan and a warlock. I main my titan and haven't touched my warlock at all. Earlier today I hit power(?)/light(?) 900 and then I turned off the ps4 to run some errands. Just now I logged on I notice that my warlock is now no longer at 750 but at 752 and the emblem has changed from the default one. I thought my account might be hacked but when I click onto my warlock it starts from the first mission, so I am just confused now? am I hacked? am I not? Is this a little bonus for reaching 900?
---
Have you gotten it to drop?
---
That super was in d1
---
It could be possible that Bungie removed this because of the availability of Exotics during Y1. It might just be a change the community never noticed because we aren‚Äôt new characters.
---
   Something to note is that you don‚Äôt get the exotic on a second character. It is/was a one time event.
---
Crucible and strike chests for the Sweet Business catalyst
---
Never got into Warlock in D1. Was more of a Hunter/Titan in D1.
---
If she had it,she wouldn‚Äôt be posting. True story
---
I'd prefer to have one where you coyly poke the enemy with a finger then skitter away.
---
Or you pull out the colonel and it pecks the enemy to death.
---
Whole lot of change... with no direction
---
Ahhhh brings me back.‚ÄùI left my Ghorn on my hunter,brb‚Äù
---
I didn‚Äôt think it was possible.
---
Welcome to Destiny 5th Year edition, lmao
---
Not at all from my experience because I did the exact same thing.  
---
All your armor drops that you start getting should also be around that 900 level so when you find something with the base stats that you like, start adding your favorite mods to it and switch to it whenever you're comfortable.  It's a pretty forgiving system that Bungie implemented so don't stress.
---
I went to the bank a mile away at 4am jus to deposit money to play. Fml
---
Fuck yourself mate.
---
I love steam names
---
nvm,I did [it.It](https://it.It)'s working fine now.
---
Grab both so you get 3 years worth of content
---
Bye dude I‚Äôm sure the community will do just fine without you
---
Sorry buddy need 6 people for raids. Best to use LFG to help find people. Best of luck
---
Dont do that shit, thats fucking toxic.
---
I can hear this photo
---
Coldheart actually isn't **too** bad in pvp and can be used casually in pve
---
Lens could actually be used in serious ad clear 
---
Everyone just hates exclusives
---
It's been 4 days, probably unpopular because it's a knee jerk reaction.
---
Only seen one
---
Its just random, i got it from a nightmare hunt if i remember right.
---
Damn girl were you listening to Russia's Greatest Love Machine or something? Rasputin came at you like the angel of death. Destiny 2 no mercy run.
---
Dats a thicc arm
---
Take it and then kill him with Gjally
---
If I weren't already used to World of Warcraft doing this for like ten years I probably would've freaked lmao.
---
Nope. Been a harry Harry Potter fan since first book release, thats not the correct quote. Its 12 years not 10.
---
We are barely a few days in with a whole seasons worth of content on a roadmap that Bungie has available via thier website. So far? I'm loving the shit out of this. Sure you can pick apart things like one exotic per class, but look at all the positive, huge systemic changes they've added like armour 2.0 and the possible buildcrafting using the artifact... That stuff is free to everyone, and the expansion content is like a chery on top.
---
The remote detonation is so much fun to use
---
Finally. I mean maybe it's just because I don't play a lot of FPS game but I stg the only other game I've seen that does this is Bloodborne. It drives me mad.
---
You can, have you talked to banshee?
---
Also it requires that you got a complete set of majestic, (obviously)
---
Im gonna see what he has hopefully something good :)
---
It really is  
---
I see a lot of people shooting it at the ground and I don't know why considering one of it's perks is if the orbs are more airborne they increase in damage.
---
I think so it explodes faster, and most people don‚Äôt yet understand it probably
---
i helped 3 friends through that mission. as soonas that last witch was dead i was booking it i told them " grab the damn fucker and start running ill see you fuckers on the other fucking side." they were in no rush they wanted to be a murder hobo on the great escape.
---
I'DLIKESOMEPOUNDCAKE!
---
"Approach slowly, Guardian."
---
It's fun, and has a good story, but it's missing so many elements from what I've heard about the first game. There's a distinct lack of good looking gear, especially in the end game where I expected lots of options. I mean a game that's been out for 3 years, and has like 5 total sets of armor for each class (exotic wise)? Most of which don't look all that good, even if they have good stats. Not to mention how much of the legendary gear just doesn't look all that great.
---
Then there's the confusion of what all is what, and how to do what, as a new player (New Light). There's not really any direction, and if you just run around and collect the missions it kind of leads you into at the beginning, you suddenly will have like 10+ quests all taking you to different places, to do different things, with no real explanation. 
---
Then there's the lack of collectable stuff that everyone I know has raved about from Destiny 1: Hunting maps for hidden ghosts, and locations, like it's fun to explore the maps, but they don't seem to give me anything as I've quickly reached the gear soft cap, and there doesn't seem to be any benefit outside of the lore, and simply running around in a new area. There's nothing that hints that I can find exotic gear or even much that's cool on the planets, outside of simply doing the old campaigns (which I'm enjoying so far). I was looking forward to collecting Ghosts, but it seems like in order to do so I'd have to pay money, which kind of stinks, and feels pretty bad.
---
This line was so good honestly bungie just keeps one upping themselves eith writing
---
Sounds very welcoming...
---
The secret: sleep 2 hours a day.
---
Does anyone have a dual monitor (3840x1080) version of this?
---
Yea the DDE ^ fucked us people who thought we switch weeks ago just to log onto steam and season pass applied there... it‚Äôs a rip off really.. thinking how spending money and something on their end pretty much we messed us all up and pass less.. look in the forum everyone is complaining about it and no word on it. Just your typical bot reply to check with support on forums
---
( "should i come back to d2 copy and paste. ")
---
Yes. Destiny 2 is amazing and in the best state a destiny game hss been in. I dare say its better than D1 at this point. There are more milestones/powerful gear than many players can do in a week ( multiplied by 3.) , 6 raids, gambit prime, tons of weapons from past seasons, tons of exotic quests and much more.
---
Forsaken fixed the year 1 content drought by dumping a ton of content, and each season since did nothing but help. Its seasons brought us forges where we can craft certain weapons, dungeons with amazing exotic quests to em, the menagerie which is basically a mini raid with matchmaking, and even a quest line about the drifter and the nine 
---
Now Shadowkeep is here and with it another HUGE dump of content, the return of eris morn and the moon patrol zone which is larger than ever, 3+ new strikes, new maps ( gambit &amp; crucible. ), EVEN MORE  weapons and exotics, as well as more story and such taking place after the death of ( Redacted. )
---
absolutely worth the purchase!
---
A new armor system is here that lets you BUILD your perk set instead of praying to RNG. A new telic is here to help you level, perk out and get better
---
D2¬† couldn't be in much of a better place ( besides needing some minor crucible tweaks. )
---
Also, if you quit because of ( Mida multitool, Lunas/Not forgotten, Prometheus lense, etc.) Being VICIOUSLY busted/OP,GOOD NEWS EVERYONE, they've beem generously nerfed down to reasonable instead of busted. 
---
So all in all, coming from a D1 alpha/Beta player who has stuck to this franchise like cancer to radiation, i dont think the franchise has ever been better.¬† The only minor complaint is, whilst d2s raids are great, they are a bit more soft, unlike the brutal dark raids of D1 ( Kings Fall. ). But, don't worry, we are still slaughtering oryx's family, because all of them have a bad case of not knowing their place.¬† ( ehem. Under my boot. ) 
---
As a traitor would say...
---
Come back to destiny, yesss? Or, you diee.....
---
( rating 9.5/10. )
---
If you're completely new, probably not. Xurs random engrammes get better the more exotics you already have, because they can't be duplicates - as opposed to random drops which will be dupes more often than not, beyond a certain point. If he offers stuff you don't have for direct purchase I'd always buy that though, just to eliminate it from the pool.
---
your right but its still very annoying, and its been like this for about 10 mins so its stuck on loading.
---
It depends on where you're at with your overall power level and what kind of build you want to play.  You eventually will have no use for the blue gear other than using it to infuse to increase to 900 so those are always pretty safe bets to use as infusion gains.  
---
The legendary gear is going to be up to you though.  You might have a low power level legendary that has great base stats for whatever build you want, so if you want a build with high recovery, you might have something currently sitting at a low level with a great base stat in that category that you'll want to hold onto until the end game.
---
For me, anything with a stat average under 50 gets dismantled.
---
Ahh a man of culture...

---
[Wait what?](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/024/081/F0ykN5e.png)
---
Getting this as well, annoying since I want to complete a bounty for patrol completions.
---
Haha, thanks for your answer, Dio Brando-sama.
---
Just wait till a titan kills him with melee
---
Already commented about it dude
---
Here‚Äôs how it works with the newest update,
---
You will commonly receive blue and occasionally purple items 1 to 6 light levels above you until you reach 900 light, after that can only go higher by doing activities such as flash points, strikes heroic missions and adventures, your basic stuff. You will also begin getting prime engrams at this time. You will get to the point where you can only get high level items by doing difficult activities like raids or nightfalls and such. Hope this helped
---
You could try the edz helmet, but I dont know if it beats these other suggestions
---
You are worse than Adolfjoseph Stalinhitler and you are the true cause of the collapse.
---
I played D2 and the first 2 expansions but then lapsed. I‚Äôm loving this after jumping back in, dunno how long it‚Äôll last but for free it‚Äôs worth a shot!
---
The game is phenomenal, I‚Äôve thought so for 3 years, it‚Äôs so good that it‚Äôs free for everyone now,
---
Hearing someone make a case for something you don't agree with or believe and give a reasonable and compelling argument for it while bringing up things you hadn't considered is different than blindly basing your opinion on somebody else's video.
---
Haha no worries. Hopefully this raid really turns up the heat even more
---
My latest go around got really really close but them we got dicked by the healers and ended up failing
---
I purchased the game when it came out for 60 Euros, i played for about 40 houres i'd  say and all my friend basically stopped playing and so did I, Noticed the game came to steam so I did the transfer, downloaded it, logged in only to see all the progression i had done basically beeing nullified bc all the gear had been set to 750. I totally agree with you.
---
Do you do carries?
---
#**I REJECT MY SUPER, JOJO!**
---
Yeah I was just downloading d2 overnight , also all my friends who I talked into downloading it also got the same problem for some reason . I hope a solution gets found
---
It appears you are asking a question about LFG/Clans, or help in-game. 
---
Please post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bzjpkr/official_lfg_megathread_v_4/) instead, look at the LFG dropdown menu on the top bar of the subreddit for various LFG resources, or check the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bvr9ex/official_faq_please_read_before_posting/?) for possibly helpful advice on how to find people to play with our advertise/find clans.
---
It was at the postmaster for the ones with the same problem
---
I sell mine for this price because I consider myself to be a good artist and I only end up paying myself minimum wage for the time I spend making them. 
---
Also, most online are just 3D printed in the right colors and I hand paint all of mine.
---
Yea it says you get the forges with new light but I'm quessing you still need forsaken to accsess the guest weapons of black armory since it was originally part of the seasonal pass that is now included in forsaken. A bit wierd honestly, dont see much use for the forges without the weapons
---
I literally got the "Black Armory Key" thing to drop from Volundr but when i look in my inventory its not there.... Any thoughts?
---
Drink a nice glass of Vex Milk before bed, eh?
---
tr√®s chic
---
It is worth keeping weapons you like, but only infuse them if you need too ( for example having to use a specific weapon for a raid boss) or if your at 930 at the least. My Midnight Coup handcannon is my pride and joy, I‚Äôve had it since year one and always infused it once I get very close to the cap
---
Probably download servers being overloaded, I had the same problem when they released forsaken.
---
Yeah, worked great. Last Call is a big campaign emblem on Tangled Shore that you just click ‚ÄúLaunch‚Äù and BOOM! - Forsaken. Storyline is really good so far.
---
He deserves more than death for that one
---
I would suggest not infusing until you hit at least 900. Doesn't take too long to get there and I actually enjoy using whatever I pickup, the weapons rotate so fast and keeps it fresh during the grind. Keep weapons you like and infuse once you are happy you can do all you want to with your level
---
Welcome to Destiny 2? You must be new.

Should I be teaming up for the first missions?

---
How long Does it take to get the confirmation email, So I can transfer my characters. I stopped playing after any dlc came out cause of the cashgrab that happened. There was not alot of content to say the least. But Now I am willing to give it another shot but ofcourse I want to use my old characters!
---
Yeah absolutely!
---
I think they removed it. There was something mentioned in the TWAB a couple of weeks ago with the update notes. Not sure how to access it now.
---
The main problem that the game had was that there wasn‚Äôt really a good entry point for new players, and making the game and some of its DLC content so far seems to be an effective way of making one.
---
And while I can agree that having new players doing activities like forges and menagerie stings a bit, we got to play that content early. 
---
That might not be suffice for you, but not everyone can be happy. There‚Äôll always be people complaining about Bungie giving away too much, or giving away too little, and that‚Äôs just the way things are.
---
Intellect mods*
---
Same thing different name.
---
Yeah, I did already talk to Devrim and I don't think I did that campaign... guess I'll do that! Thank you :)
---
hell yeah dude, looks like wailord came out of your chest and consumed your head.
---
I believe it‚Äôs a +5 power drop no matter what.
---
It will drop higher. I made the quest with pwrlvl 911 and it dropped 915
---
Bruh. Maybe in another language? Not sure tho.
---
Are you referring to the Shadowkeep ending ?
---
Didn‚Äôt they remove those quests?
---
Sure Absolute Lad, the L in Absolute is an i, I‚Äôll join tomorrow
---
You can actually kill this guy at 920 if you can keep the add numbers down and avoid his attacks. 2 man makes it a doddle.
---
I've been using this nickname for like 15+ years, never had a single problem with anybody... i don't know how the f it can be offensive
---
You payed for the season as well. W8 till the SotD kicks in and there will be more. My hypothesis is that shadowkeep was $25, but we payed an extra $10 for the season. So uve only experienced less than $25 of content. We still have the dungeon and other activities to come.
---
No that would break the economy
---
Again. 
---
THE.STORY.IS.NOT.FINISHED.YET.
---
It will be continued in  the raid, the vex offensive and in future seasons. 
---
Bungie is shifting the game more towards an actual mmo and not that much towards the casual Player.
---
I alteady explained that to my clanmates like 10 times.
---
How do I play the new tutorial mission without yeeting one of my chars?
---
Take a look at this picture.
---
https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1531332/destiny-2-new-light-content.jpg 
---
That's quite a lot so i recommend not buying shadowkeep or forsaken yet and get through all of this first. It's pretty much everything released up until now except some strikes, the reckoning game mode, shadowkeep and forsaken campaigns and some other minor things.
---
Is 950 the absolute max level?
---
Sony gave the go for crossplay, now it‚Äôs on the devs.
---
She's on the east side of the tower. If you open up your map you can mark her.
---
Straight up what me and my homie just yelled into the mic when we saw the pyramid ship
---
Search for my comment here.
---
I was is using bottom tree nightstalker so I just smoked invis my way out of it. Bottom tree just became my fav subclass after the changes
---
I got the full undamaged set for my hunter as well, make sure to keep your armor - you probably won't be able to get it again!
---
Cool thanks
---
They are just quest, you're not loosing anything you unlocked and never was a thing, you just gain the ability to replay/play through those campaign at a higher or current light.  
---
   
---
‚Ä¢Armor 2.0 reworked the armor and they now all function the same and the only difference will be the element and the mod they can use as each element favor a category of weapons.  
---
The good news is that you can finally tailor your look instead of praying RNG for the perk you want, the bad news is now armor have a total set of point that are distributed across the 6 stats and the soft cap i think is 60 total point (but you can still add mod like mobility etc to go beyond), there's probably dozens of video that cover the subject in better detail.  
---
On the other hand, weapons haven't changed and still have RNG in their perk roll.
---
‚Ä¢Mod are now permanent unlock (aside seasonal specific ones) and can be applied anytime allowing you to swap mod whenever you need and as long as you've got glimmer. Old mod you can just reducce them since they serve no purpose anymore and you wont unlock their new variant with them.
---
Complete the main story (red war)
---
The 5 years players ARE STILL having as much fun as your are.
---
Godspeed guardian!!!!
---
Hunters are good for killing or shutting down supers, Warlocks are good at being unkillable and titans are good at being unskilled fuck heads
---
Well okay maybe the problem is that i stayed in the edz, but i can remember that there were enemies that were way too strong for the beginning a year ago. But if you say that there will come harder enemies on other maps, ill give the game another shot :)
---
Yea Movie of the week
---
It took me reading all the way down here to figure out that the OP meant by this.
---
You can still access it with a glitch - the same one that allows you to get into the room where the new exotic bow resides.
---
Nothing in it has really changed honestly.
---
***loads sweet business and puts on actium war rig with religious intent***
---
Go talk to Amanda Holiday in the tower. For future reference, check if other people are having the same problem as you. This has been a bug topic on r/DestinyTheGame
---
More of a cold and overdone take.
---
/r/thanksihateit
---
lol
---
All enemies in every activity is at least 750, the stuff that was added with shadowkeep will have difficulties between 750 and 980
---
Okay, thanks for the info
---
aw, das so nice, that medal counts just as much haha
---
You're
---
Ahhh, Michael Salvatori. The legendary composer
---
Well no.  Not weird, it's the first at you get in the red war campaign, so you'd already have it. Someone else here mentioned that as well.
---
Diminishing returns for sure but they‚Äôre definitely the faster.
---
Ya I did kill them all, figured since it wasn't working I'd try the legacy warmind content to try and get it
---
thx man i'll try my best :D
---
&gt;I hope we get exotic finishers that only work on certain bosses...
---
I'll take "dumbest things I've ever read" for $400 Alex.
---
That's one way to play it. But honestly this made my day
---
No I'm new and its now F2P on steam, so I'll give it a shoot and if I like it I'll by the new DLC's
---
That's how I am with melee on 5 lol
---
What? That thing is a brick
---
Without access to the latest... I couldn't possibly recommend anything as I don't know what is and isn't locked behind Forsaken and Shadowkeep. 
---
Everything is armor 2.0 now, so just go for whatever suits your playstyle. Want to be a tank? Be a tank. Spec into Resilience and whatnot.

Shadowkeep is its own dlc. It‚Äôs not bundled with anything.
---
Can we get a spoiler tag?
---
if only it would drop for me.
---
If you use cross save your guardians and gear will transfer with you but the licenses for game content do not. So you will not have access to forsaken or Shadowkeep content on PS4 even if you have purchased them on pc unless you purchase them there as well. Because New Light was released and it is free that includes Curse of Osiris and Warmind content in the free version. So you can do this: activate cross save through Bungie.net, download new light on PlayStation, play your regular guardians, pick up the quest for CoO from Amanda in the tower and go nuts in the infinite forest.

Yes, you do

How do I unlock and equip new weapons? It says I have them discovered but unsure how to equip them. Also where do I find new weapons? At this point, I've only found them on accident.

all classes have their special things that make them good, but throwing knife is superior
---

Personally I still think the game can be really fun. Trading is really the only thing I wish they'd add. 
---
But otherwise, Destiny is the only game my little group of gamer friends all fall back on. The guns just feel good.
---
So u mean that if f2p player have a player with dlc in party, he can play forges, but solo he have no access?

:/ that sucks

Ahh yes...that's me 100% every time I use the wardcliff
---
u/vredditshare
---
I really dont know but i dont think you could do it
---
1) Find armor with higher intellect.
---
2) Place intellect mods on armor pieces.
---
3) That's how you increase intellect.
---
Edit: 4) Masterwork armor that has #1/2 completed, for even more of a stat boost.
---
You could pick it up last October from the Halloween event, maybe they'll make it available again this October
---
AFAIK now all the campaigns are independent. You can just go to Mars or Mercury and start those campaigns and hop on and off independently.
---
Ah. Then it's RNG based I believe. I'm not certain though.
---
Cool, I've done it twice. First one wasn't easy, second was easier

---
You are The one that gets angry over a question
---
You already figured the Amanda Holiday part, what was Bungie thinking about not putting any indication of having to go to her?
---
It doesn't take a lot of time to get to titan. I'd start at the Red War and play through. It's a good story line and leads to everything else. I think it would be hard to step into forsaken first. And while I don't mind curse if Osiris, it can be skipped altogether.
---
I used to get deathly sick YEARS ago playing unreal tournament, yeah, but just forced my way through after reading someplace it would go away. It did
---
Got the bundle which was shirt and the replica for $92 US, and no I didn't know it would be that small
---
I've got mine from the end of a strike, some have gotten it at the end of a crucible match so it's a safe bet to say it's either of those
---
if you want to play a different char, why not switch now? if not the Power Level Cap is 960.
---
Your rage posts are everywhere my friend. Raids are upon us. Take it easy. Being angry and arguing with people just for the sake of being right is hard on your body and mind.

Sorry but I doubt you will find anyone today since raid
---
I haven‚Äôt done any of the campaigns on my titan and I‚Äôm 920, but I did do them on my other two characters, you miss out on some exotic missions if you don‚Äôt do them, like the ace of spades, but no you don‚Äôt have to do them at all
---
Console master race
---
Do you already have the quest?
---
Yeah new light is just a new name they threw on since they sort of changed the way the game works
---
So it's a random drop from ANY raid then?
---
What about the raids?  Is anything set at power level 750 easy?
---
The website now lists it under Thorn Miniature Replica and lists dimensions, but wasn't like that when ordered when it was originally orderable
---
No
---
Aww I feel noticed &lt;3 
---
Nah, I‚Äôm just sick and tired of seeing the same old stupid shit every time I scroll down my reddit feed man xD
---
It isn‚Äôt just 10 seconds, every single time the game has to load it will be faster. Any time you want to travel to a planet it will be faster, loading into crucible? Faster.

---
Red War is a good story, CoO can be skipped? Now that ui type that maybe not. It somewhat explains the Vex. Warmind fun,but not necessary.
---
They disabled that flag for a bug
---
Oh and light is capped to 750 right now. So even if you are 900 light...If you play something that require 750...your 900 light doesn't shit. Just saying.
---
There's an issue with it not working so Bungir disabled it for right now.
---
such a powerful line, coming from a basically silent protagonist
---
Play the story in this order and you‚Äôll feel less overwhelmed. Everything else are side quests and public events. 
---
1: **Red War** This consist of the base game before any DLC so play this through first. Try your best to not get too sidetracked. Plot basically is about the Cabal leader, Dominus Ghaul, who kidnaps and tortures the speaker for the Traveler, to learn how to obtain the power of light from the traveler. 
---
2: **Curse of Osiris** This is the second expansion to the story. It‚Äôs fairly short and can be repetitive but it sheds some backstory and character depth to Osiris. The plot is to basically rescue him from the Vex. 
---
3: **Warmind** This is the third installment to the story. Plot of this one follows a guardian named Ana Bray on Mars, who you meet quickly and aid her to discover her past. After finding the core to the Warmind Rasputin and a new swarm of Hive is surfaced, Ana decides to use Rasputins power after he‚Äôs resurrected to help guardians, but the vanguard unapproved her actions. 
---
Those are the dlcs you currently own. Forsaken is the fourth installment and Shadowkeep is the fifth. Play the story and see if you like it and can immerse yourself in it before buying the other two. 
---
The planet you‚Äôre referring to of the waves and oil rig is Titan. 
---
‚Ä¢if you want help join my clan and I can walk you through the game and help any way I can. GT is TheSaltyFalcon. 
---
Xbox is my platform. [prophets of valor discord ](https://discord.gg/ZsjUEst) 
---
TL;DR If you need help tracking the story and planets it takes place on, open your directory and go to destinations. Hold LT (XB1) and a pop up side menu will appear and tell you where you need to travel to continue that quest. 
---
You can also go to the quest tab via directory and track the quest you want by high lighting it with the cursor and clicking A on it. This allows you to track the quest simply by pressing back button to bring your ghost out and your tracked quest will appear on the right of the screen with your progress percentage. without pulling the directory up as often.
---
That Looney Toons delayed fall at the end really makes this clip top tier
---
They disabled the tire mini game too? I don‚Äôt have shadowkeep. Also, what did it do?
---
That‚Äôs the first step of the quest, you won‚Äôt get it after finishing that part, and I played gambit for 5 hours last night and it spawned one time
---
Sort of like a mix of Gambit and Survival. Maybe a 3v3 game mode where players have to kill ads in a contained area to get orbs of transmogrification to power the invasion portal. 
---
The more orbs you get, the stronger the transmog.(For example, if the ads are Fallen, stage 1 turns you into a Dreg, Stage 2 turns you into a captain &amp; the last stage would be a servitor) The invader would have the usual invasion timer to try and wipe the other team.
---
Not scoring a kill after either the timer runs out or getting killed will lock the player out of the next invasion, meaning players will need to co-operate to co-ordinate invasions. (Like Gambit)
---
Players will be able to res their team mates, but only after an unsuccessful invasion.
---
The game is won if either an invader wipes the opposing team or a team fails 3 invasions in a row.
---
Thank you for notifying me
---
Nahhhh bro I used to be a raid leader/teacher in my old clan. When you got good song solid squad they‚Äôre fun af but trying to teach a pleb the raids and they‚Äôre just not getting it is hella frustrating 
---
Imagine spending a cumulative of 27 hours in Levi and the guy was still clueless by the end of it
---
I know this question might be stupid but do you already have the gun?
---
Reminds me of how you cant name a pokemon in GO Muffin, but you can name them Terrorist
---
You are just capped to 750...no god mode lol dont worry
---
I got destiny 2 last year as part of PS plus. I jumped back in this year and I am loving it. However, I do not have forsaken expansion and it is not listed on the PS Store.
---
Is there a way to purchase forsaken? I know the in game store can help, however wouldn‚Äôt it be expensive? Can any one please guide me? 
---
I read the pinned guide and it does not cover this
---
Can you at least tag me in the title if you are going to repost it?
---
A challenge is something that rewards powerful gear. So like completing 8 bounties for shaxx or Zavala should count
---
ok i'll give it a go ty :)
---
Did you try re logging
---
Alright, thank you!
---
Many lulz
---
G
---
You don't get any exotics from legacy quests anymore.
---
Completed Red War yesterday and got nothing
---
I'm going to say it. I love the Wabesplitter! I'm using it as a primary.
---
This guy Lores/
---
They're no longer held in your inventory there in your quest log.
---
Also if you run the new nightfall strike with matchmaking you'll get 7 per run.
---
I'm not sure then because I have never had this issue
---
And Nightfall runs can be pretty hard...they have restrictions and trust me you are feeling it !
---
Yeah there is no option to get it
---
Play pvp in the shortest game playlist you get 3 blues per game
---
The flag was essentially just a rally point, and the tire game was literally just like the ball in the Tower, pretty sure it didn't do anything but provide entertainment.
---
You don't want to waste your fragments on that flag anyway
---
D2 is a graphics card intensive game, so unfortunately if your graphics card isnt good then the game wont be able to run well :(
---
same here!!! anyone knows how to fix this ? im on the steam side btw..
---
From 900 to 950, do weekly quests for crucible, gambit, nightfall, specific quests, etc. Those are often just doing a certain gamemode 3 to 5 times. Post 950 you have to do raids, iron banner, or other very hard end game events to get above 950 base gear.
---
sealed ahmkara grasps
---
I would love to buy it but I have to buy the Forsaken DLC and I dont plan on doing that yet :/
---
Is Forsaken included in the Shadowkeep Digital Deluxe edition?
---
It‚Äôs the weapon parts from the gate lords eye mod
---
No it is not, you have to buy it seperately.
---
Drifter does the permanent killing himself
---
She gives you a quest to defeat vex/gatelords
---
Yesssss. But at random when you invade you spawn as as enemy character (hive, house of wolves ,Chrimson what have you. The more orbs you pass through the gate the higher chance of spawning as an enemy champion.
---
I was just about to post this. You beat me to it!
---
Now where do you get the thing
---
He's using Riskrunner and just got shot at by a fallen
---
you don't need forsaken to get access x√ºr and there are quests you can do without the dlc
---
No one said that was hard. Just load into the raid and kill the ones at the start. Where are the gate lords tho?
---
Oh, I'm talking about like the Cayote armor for Hunters from Xur, i thought that was what you were talking about also
---
Idk man! But I did just get a memory of Cayde cloak as a random world drop? So it might have changed
---
How do you actually get into the vex game ?
---
It says "Require Empowered Decryption Core". Anyone who knos something about it please let us know!
---
Roam around the Moon until you see giant floating Vex orbs in the sky. Impossible the miss. Under them will spawn Vex and a gate lord, kill em for the quest.
---
you start the raid and just kill them vex's
---
Anytime friend.
---
Its not the public event you are waiting for. Its the enemy is movig against each other event. About once every 10minutes. Fallen vandal and dreg will continously spawn from only that door to a max of 5 total i think. If you doorcamp it, they respawn unendingly until the enemy moving against each other event ends about 5 minutea later.
---
1 second isn't worth the price difference tbh
---
Sealed ahamkara grasps, peregrine grieves and jotunn are disabled until the world's first raid run is complete
---
Is this around the vex invasion zones? I‚Äôve been trying to figure out how to get to those lol
---
Depends. Some games have more than a 1s difference. I also didn‚Äôt find nvme to be that much more expensive.
---
there are some exotics exclusive to the dlc but there is a large chunk that you can still unlock
---
I can‚Äôt figure it out either
---
And that‚Äôs why you roll with The Colony
---
Alright I understand. Thanks a lot.
---
Same.
---
Did you already have it in your collection or was it random? Because in the collection it still says that you have to earn it by finishing the forsaken campaign.
---
In a month or 2.
---
Must be 2250+
---
40 clears
---
Damn, thanks for taking the time to type all that out. 
---
Do Hunters play any differently with sniper rifles compared to other classes?
---
Anyone know where/how to get the vex lords?
---
Whole point of the covert ops old boy, you not hearing about it.
---
Where do I find those quests?
---
I did the first area of the raid for vex kills now I just need gatelord
---
Nice!!!
---
In shadowkeep they nerfed rally barricades and luna factions so they only give increased reload speed, they don't reload straight from reserves anymore
---
"People still play destiny?"
---
What rewards would you like?
---
You paid the asking price...it then went "on sale" essentially.
---
Ask yourself what other products you've purchased in the past that a company retroactively "rewards" you for paying the listed MSRP prior to any sale or promotion.
---
the moon now has a random event where a vex gate will open, and a vex gatelord will pop up from that

Question about exotics: I understand the power level of drops is tied to your overall gear level, which is capped at 900 until you do powerful drops. Anyway, does this mean if I get an exotic at like 800 power that it‚Äôll be obsolete to purples and blues as I level up? And if so, when should I bother hunting exotics?
---
But since it went free, we kinda got fucked over if we payed, especially if you payed 100 dollars like me
---
[removed]
---
God I hate that term so much and i played since D1 launch.
---
Kinderguardians is so derogatory, it makes all you new players sound like children.
---
Does that happen at any given place on the moon or certain area?
---
I'm not 100% sure what you mean. The season pass includes three seasons, each of which have a new mode that usually has weapons you can get from playing it along side some exotic quests. You can't get forsaken or shadowkeep weapons from it but you can get hammerhead, Thorn etc.
---
Sorry new player here.
---
So the light of the boots is somewhere around 1,804 light?
---
Well first ill have to find a way to clear up this 1999 nokia quality picture to figure out what the hell is going on in it.
---
It was changed to increasing reload speed.
---
Auto reloading created an environment where bosses were no longer challenging.
---
Forsaken and Shadowkeep are completely seperate things. The reason Digital Deluxe is so expensive is because it includes the current season pass along with the next 4 seasons.
---
Thanks so much, this is much needed.
---
Bro what
---
You could use a controller when it was on [battle.net](https://battle.net), I don't see why they would remove it. Probably just wrong info.
---
You can plug your controller into the PC, and play it when in game; weird it says it's m&amp;k only, it's not
---
Xan
---
Have you?
---
disabled for the raid for 24hrs
---
I actually bought forsaken when it was on sale so I played a little bit of that. Is the black armory cool and worth playing?
---
Run around the moon between he 3 invasion areas on the map, they'll show up eventually. Think of it like a public event.
---
How old is that video? I remember seeing this farm in Y1 when we still had factions.
---
I thought for sure they fixed this.
---
They have been disabled for 24 hours. They are broken and an advantage for the Raid.......so you should be able to use them after reset tomorrow.
---
I see.
---
Well if you start the training mission again from the beginning you already have all the guns and rocket launcher you collected first time around. That's a mistake and makes no sense. If you should lose all the progress that is fine but then you should start with no weapons like you did the first time :-)
---
Yup. I just had this issue two times in a row. It always freezes after second phase.
---
Anyone got ideas
---
But the iron man suit is an exoskeleton, you don't need muscle to wear it
---
You might need to restart them, sadly. Go and talk to Amanda Holiday in the tower, she'll let you play the first three campaigns.
---
thank you much
---
Seems the whole forge stuff might be the problem. Went back to the lost sector with the forge and it worked fine...
---
thank you
---
More information is required before anyone could assist.
---
Error codes?  
---
System info - computer reboots or crashes knocking offline?  Hardware conflicts?
---
been on for over an hour between the zones and only see those 4-5 adds that spawn... and the game is using substantially more CPU for this than yesterday on PC.
---
Froze after second phase as well. Happened twice in a row
---
Dude I‚Äôm just looking for help fixing this
---
Have you done the strike that‚Äôs on the moon? I think it may be part of the mission.
---
I need pics dude cause there is no way to make it happen
---
First of all, slow doooooown! I'd really recommend going through the campaigns slowly, playing strikes and exploring the planets as you go. But yea, until you hit 900 just dismantle everything that's lower than your power (Keeping 1 of every legendary in your vault is what some people do since some of them are really good, but it's up to you) and keep the exotics stored or in use. If you want though you can store all your legendaries and then dismantle them when you get the "+1 legendary shard per dismantle" thing from the season pass (which will give you a crap ton of shards). Don't worry about claiming stuff late, it doesn't take that long to hit max power anyway.
---
Have you tried uninstalling then reinstalling
---
Just keep at it. Maybe go to orbit and back a few times. It took me quite a while to find one too, luckily though you only really need to do them once.
---
Rice cake
---
?
---
A rice cake, you get them randomly (I think?) from chests and stuff after beating the campaign.
---
You find them by opening chests around the moon.
---
Kind of don‚Äôt want to do that since it‚Äôs going to take 4 hours to install and I‚Äôm not even sure that‚Äôll fix it. I‚Äôm playing on Xbox
---
Still dont really understand why they buried the old campaigns in such an obscure place... Why not let Doctor Manhattan (whatever that blue bald dude is called) give them?
---
I'm currently playing through the Red War and its amazing! I mean, sure, the writing is a little... Janky, but at least it gives me some context to what the heck I'm actually doing and why.
---
After or before the necklace part
---
I swear I looked a year ago and that option wasn't there. Thanks for that.
---
More like when I heard Omnigul; arc singe/grounded/switchblade trauma. 0.0
---
Join the stronk side. Leave your old foolish ways behind.
---
I don‚Äôt think that matters, honestly. It‚Äôs like getting the gift of mint in the dreaming city.
---
Came here to say this. Outlaw/actually firefly/killclip+
---
I have been lol
---
Why did they block off the vent secret room in the tower :( just returned after over a year of absence in playing I can‚Äôt get in
---
I hope not. It‚Äôs a 6 stack.
---
That's bungie saying "chargers suck"
---
How can you crouch so fast
---
It is not the full version, no.
---
Might be a glitch. Did it give you anything?
---
Shit. Thanks for answering me.
---
Don't be toxic
---
Quests are just for weapons though right?
---
Is anyone able to access the first step to Gofannon? I‚Äôve been killing powerful Fallen and normal fallen to no avail
---
Just got it yesterday. It's amazing. Thank you.
---
Have you not gone to Mara's Throne Room in the Dreaming City?
---
The vex will open a gate and a ton of then will come through it with a gate lord. Look for it in the notifications at the bottom left. A way to trigger the event is to complete a public event. Within 2 or 3 minutes the vex event will spawn.  
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox add me: ItsLunch
---
I‚Äôll help you out!
---
I asked for help not your opinion
---
It was only recently that I realized lore triumphs have a button to read the entire thing.
---
I thought they were all supposed to be one sentence long.
---
Graphic design is my passion
---
It's the full game with no level cap. That guy is wrong. It just doesn't have the 2 new DLCs. You can still get infinite levels
---
I just installed it rn
---
How do you know that's not what bungie did?
---
True power
---
Its the full vanilla game plus more!
---
Yeah I feel you but losing 10 games in a row because of unbalance isn‚Äôt really the best learning experience
---
So sick!
---
No problem. I haven't done any shadow keep missions yet although I have the DLC, but currently at 904 right now. It helps to build a character up doing all of the bounties and weekly challenges, then transfer those guns to another and quickly build that one up and then some. Then to the 3rd and get higher. Rinse and repeat that process after every weekly reset. Also any raids will help as well
---
No u
---
Post coming down soon....cant advertise this crap here
---
Thanks
---
Sick helmet.
---
Same place as the Chargers this season....nowhere
---
Someone is a salty boi today aren‚Äôt they
---
Wish they buffed it to drop a well when critical instead of when dead :(
---
Nice gonna put em on my warlock and titen once im done with my hunter. Thanks again
---
Salt ballllll
---
Probably because of all the teams going for world firsts. It'll probably be down a few spots after today
---
Are you the creator of the comic this came from?
---
I had quite a lot of success with the new moon auto rifle you get from Eris. 
---
You can also try the dreaming city one or the forge one.
---
It's actually destiny number 2
---
No this is a piece of fan art for the meme
---
To be fair, Rocket League exploded with players when Destiny went down before launch lol
---
So if I'm gamesharing too and i just got shadowkeep but my buddy got SK and season pass, is there a way I can only buy the season pass?
---
It's the full version. You just dont have access to the Forsaken and Shadowkeep DLC's
---
Wait, so you know where the chest is in the EDZ? The one for the quest from Werner? Not the original Lumina quest, right?
---
Spooky bow distance
---
Are challenges available for you yet? You might have to do some story missions first
---
Did he have any trouble with the season pass? I got it and my brother is game sharing off me but he doesn‚Äôt seem to have it for some reason
---
FORTNITE BAD
---
Anyone else seem to notice that gofannon is in rotation more then the others? I had volundr the Gofannon then burgusia right back to gofannon

The dream bane armor from the moon
---
I get some serious Death Stranding Vibes on the Moon. Specially with those floaty one on the Horizon, almost like they are watching you raping another Vex Invasion Spawn.
---
Even with shitty perks that gun is good
---
It's possible if you use a busted set up.
---
I don‚Äôt think he did. Does he have it installed? Mines called forsaken annual pass since I bought the complete edition so I‚Äôm not sure what yours will be called
---
Planets only have a handful of travel points on them. Not every zone has one
---
Thank you for the gold, kind stranger!
---
For some reason the pic isn't loading for me, is it the chest with the three runes on the front of it?
---
Midnight Coup (Leviathan) - Really good pve kinetic hand cannon.
---
Recluse (Crucible) - Really good pvp and pve hand cannon.
---
Tataras Gaze (BA) - Good pve sniper in my opinion if you can get snapshot and kill clip.
---
IKELOS SG (EP) - Insanely good pve shotgun really good at dealing tons of damage, especially if their 3 or more people with thim.
---
Sleepless (DC) - good rl considering this is destiny 2.
---
Nation of the Beast (LW) - good energy hand cannon if you can get rampage and outlaw.
---
Thats really all I can think about, if your looking for good exotics then Thorn, 1k voices, and Bad Juju are pretty good.
---
I know some of y'all just memeing but you KNOW there are people who irrationally hate Fortnite and I would just love to hear the reasoning behind that
---
I just started using it, It literally doesn't move while shooting damn
---
snip
---
I've been messing with this all day, and I can't get it to open, only stays at Moderate.
---
Using an ASUS router... I've tried quite a lot of settings, to get it going, but it won't get to Open :\\
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
EDIT - Fixed it, was another device claiming those ports -\_- removed it, and now its open!
---
Saaame its finger lickin good
---
Who hurt you?
---
They should be on a chest. Around that area you will find those same ruins. Shoot the ruins in the order the chest shows. But some of the runs you have to shoot are hidden around the chest.
---
I just downloaded Destiny 2 on PC since it was free now on Steam.  I think I've done a few story mission and I did one strike called Nightfall: The Ordeal which was kind of hard but i beat it with 2 random people.  What should I be focusing on over the first few hours of the game?  My main confusion right now is just what exactly to do.  I also started as  hunter and i'm reading that maybe i should have picked another character...should i start over as another one?
---
Moon is haunted.
---
Light leveling is easy if you know what you're doing.
---
I can't get them to spawn for me.  I've been chilling at Anchor for like 30 minutes now.  At some point don't they start falling out of the sky?
---
Season pass doesn't share with gameshare
---
Play the new campaign.
---
How earlier we‚Äôre talking?
---
Think of The Traveler like you would Christianity‚Äôs God.
---
God is supposed to be omnipotent 
---
God is supposed to be omnibenevolent 
---
God is supposed to be omniscient.
---
But since evil exists in the world can God be all three of those things? 
---
Now also think of the Pyramid as Lucifer/The Devil/Satan (whatever you want to call him). He‚Äôs a great deceiver. He‚Äôs powerful. But the Devil isn‚Äôt coming to you to possess your soul. The devil is going to try and make you comfortable. To win you over with temptation. To make you second guess god. To make you stray away from the light. 
---
The light abandoned Cayde (the all powerful, omnipotent light couldn‚Äôt have done ANYTHING?)
---
The light allowed The Great Disaster to happen (the all powerful light, omnipotent light couldn‚Äôt have done anything?)
---
The light is weakness (The light couldn‚Äôt help your ghost not be taken over SO EASILY?) 
---
The Ghost is your hecking spirit basically and it was taken over with no struggle. THAT‚ÄôS scary. This thing that gives you your strength/magic/immortality, was taken over and could‚Äôve been destroyed easily. But the pyramid (devil) was fine with just toying with you. 
---
And we‚Äôre supposed to be the pawn between God and The Devil. The middle man between The Light and The Darkness. Day vs Night. 
---
Your breakthrough moment is when you decide to stand for peace and justice, not because of some higher power regardless of whether it‚Äôs good or bad, but because it‚Äôs the right thing to do.
---
I'm sorry, what's that?
---
#MOONS HAUNTED
---
Jade rabbit. Find rice cakes. Like the cats in Dreaming City
---
I don't know. I started some of the campaign but haven't finished them
---
Grab the SSD and don't let your dreams be dreams.  Do it!
---
Don‚Äôt worry about Nation Of The Beasts and 1k voices since they both come from the last wish raid and it can be extremely time cosuming to get those two especially Nation considering random rolls.
---
Forsaken isnt free btw, its $25
---
Well played gentlemen. Well played...
---
Started using my Jade Rabbit again cause of these haha
---
Im at 901 and its been a massive pain in the ass, I fucking hate bounties with every fiber in my body so ive just been grinding weeklys and the 920 nightfall.

/r/Corridor look you made it to the Destiny subreddit!
---
How are you doing the vex offensive?  It says I need the eye of the moon completion but I can't find any vex or gate lords
---
They always spawn after a public event, you just have to wait like 2 minutes
---
SGA; You have all 3 in Collections
---
LOOT CAVES!!!
---
Only weapon I didn‚Äôt finish in a single run was graviton lance, it took two runs which is pretty insane for 1k cosmology kills
---
This is extremely helpful, thanks!
---
Are the premium season pass rewards retroactive?
---
I suppose you‚Äôre right I think this one is important to experience first hand and I love the lore of this being the hardest thing to do in the game, I guess I‚Äôm also a little salty about getting to a point in the raid where 6 Darci‚Äôs couldn‚Äôt do the necessary dps.  You definitely won‚Äôt be disappointed by this raid though
---
Are you saying Tony Stark has more muscle than Thor and Captain America?
---
I feel ya. My D1 group on Xbox One was such a tight crew and I loved playing with them. Took a couple years off and built a gaming PC and picked up D2. Now I simply can't find any group that compares. I'm still getting ready for the new raid but not looking forward to finding a good group to play with.
---
When the invasion starts, look at the sky for a big vex "cloud" under it you will find the gate lords
---
Play the free stuff, invest more if you enjoy it. If you want to know the story, check out YouTuber "My name is Byf".
---
Same. All my PS4 1%er buddies went to PC. Now I'm a universal backpack when I run solo.
---
This... Does put a smile on my face
---
No problem
---
It‚Äôs the small things that count
---
You‚Äôre looking in on a different direction to both a lost sector and the Whisper of the Worm Dungeon. I know this because I explored an exploit before that allowed you to glitch into this area from a completely different place and glitch back into the Dungeon further along the jump puzzle. Saving time.
---
Touche
---
No one exotic armor and weapon
---
Everything drops 2.0 now
---
Im more into understanding the systems and how 2 get things tutorials rather than the story but thanks for the advice :)
---
Hahah hell yeah! Take your time, lol you're doing just fine. üòÇ
---
6 ft tall and must hold at least 4 world records
---
Do tower bounties work?
---
Never mind. I just answered my own question. They do.
---
They actually did it wtf.
---
So i made a new character just to do the campaign again but the tutorial was really short and it just sent me straight to the traveler? Where can I find the campaign?
---
I was standing by one of the NPCs and he was talking about cayde being dead, so did the game just skip everything for the new players???
---
I haven‚Äôt really tried the weapons out too much but it is at least worth the powerful rewards. And it‚Äôs fun, like a shorter menagerie. 
---
Actually, it is worth doing to get the new seasonal armor though. You can‚Äôt equip the dreambane mod on older armor, they don‚Äôt have the slot.
---
Anyone else got Control vibes too? I played that before Shadowkeep and all the floating spirits remind me of the I guess husks floating around in that game. Plus they both have a red color to them.
---
Whats yours Steam name or Steam Code?
---
Just gimme my arca plasmor in Destiny and Thunderlord in Warframe and I'll be happy
---
I think you ment ‚ÄúThe lord of Destiny just beat Fortnite on Twitch‚Äù
---
Well isn't this more about the fact, rather than wording?
---
Yes for 24h. Bungie postet that few hours ago
---
Yeah the forge has to be on a specific day
---
