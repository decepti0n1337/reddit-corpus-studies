If you're getting shot with Ace of spades and they land every shot ( they shot first)... When do you use this healing shield from alpha lupi? If your answer is after shot 2, you're already dead. If it's after shot 1, whaa? No one with a k/d above 1.2 uses alpha lupi in PvP.

IIRC i saw somewhere on here this was happening in comp and the person would go to their triumph page and then back out and it fixed it for some reason.

While possibly not aliens, definitely UFOs:

ASTRONAUTS

"I believe that these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this planet from other planets which obviously are a little more technically advanced than we are here on Earth."
---
‚Äî Colonel Gordon Cooper, Mercury &amp; Gemini Astronaut
---
"I happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet and the UFO phenomenon is real. It has been covered up by governments for quite some time now."
---
‚Äî Captain Edgar Mitchell, Apollo 14 Astronaut
---
"...I've been asked [about UFOs] and I've said publicly I thought they [UFOs] were somebody else, some other civilization."
---
‚Äî Astronaut Eugene Cernan, Apollo 17 Commander
---
"I was testing a P-51 fighter in Minneapolis when I spotted this object. [...] It looked like a saucer, a disk. About the same time, I realized that it was suddenly going away from me - and there I was, running at about 300 miles per hour. I tracked it for a little way, and then all of a sudden the damn thing just took off. It pulled about a 45 degree climbing turn and accelerated and just flat disappeared."
---
‚Äî Captain Donald Slayton, Mercury Astronaut
---
"Statistically it's a certainty there are hugely advanced civilizations, intelligence, life forms out there. I believe they're so advanced they're even doing interstellar travel. I believe it's possible they even came here."

---
"Unknown objects are operating under intelligent control... It is imperative that we learn where UFOs come from and what their purpose is..." (1) "Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about the UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe that unknown flying objects are nonsense." (2)
---
‚Äî Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter, first Director of the CIA, 1947-1950
---
"We had a job to do, wether right or wrong, to keep the public from getting excited." (2)
---
‚Äî Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Scientific consultant for Air Force Project Blue Book
---
"Of course UFOs are real, and they are interplanetary. The cumulative evidence for the existence of UFOs is quite overwhelming and I accept the fact of their existence."
---
‚Äî Air Chief Marshall Lord Hugh Dowding, Commanding Officer of the Royal Air Force during WWII

"We must insist upon full access to disks recovered. For instance, in the La case the Army grabbed it and would not let us have it for cursory examination."
---
‚Äî J. Edgar Hoover, first Director of the FBI

‚Äî Ben Rich, former Head of the Lockheed Skunk Works
---
"This 'flying saucer' situation is not at all imaginary or seeing too much in some natural phenomena. Something is really flying around. The phenomenon is something real and not visionary or fictitious."

ROCKET SCIENTISTS &amp; PHYSICISTS

"I am completely convinced that UFOs have an out-of-world basis."

---
‚Äî President Gerald Ford
---
"I don't laugh at people any more when they say they've seen UFOs. It was the darndest thing I've ever seen. It was big, it was very bright, it changed colors and it was about the size of the moon. We watched it for ten minutes, but none of us could figure out what it was."
---
‚Äî President Jimmy Carter
---
"I looked out the window and saw this white light. It was zigzagging around. I went up to the pilot and said, have you ever seen anything like that? He was shocked and he said, "Nope." And I said to him: "Let's follow it!" We followed it for several minutes. It was a bright white light. We followed it to Bakersfield, and all of a sudden to our utter amazement it went straight up into the heavens. When I got off the plane I told Nancy all about it." "I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside of this world."

All credit goes to /u/Alx__ for compiling these. Sources for these quotes can be found at http://spaceflare.net. Many of them are on video, in context. For example, this one.

It is recognized that quotes are not proof. However:
---
There is compelling evidence that UFOs are physical phenomena, not imaginary or hallucinatory. They are captured on radar that only detects physical objects, and perform feats not explainable by known physics. 90-95% of sightings can be explained by known phenomena, but 5-10% cannot.

"The government wouldn't cover it up." - The US government didn't acknowledge the existence of Area 51 until last year. Evidence of UFOs is compelling to the extent that to deny their existence is tantamount to science denial. Earnest study of available information makes it impossible to come away with the impression that they could be fictitious or hallucinatory.

Doing the weeklies and dailys help out a lot in terms of power level.. so do raids as well if youre into that sort of thing. Additionally, if you already have one character that is 750 light level. Grind out some loot from that character and then use it for the other characters if the armor is applicable for that class. Otherwise, I'd recommend just transferring the weapons grinded out using your higher light level character. If you dont have a high light level char then simply just grind out till you get to 750. Thats what worked for me.

The short, shitty, answer is you have to be social, willing to try things and making sure you admit your mistakes. While you will get groups with assholes, you will also find groups with cool people, find 5 active people who are decent human beings and you have yourself a raid team, you have to make friends :P.

Or make your own discord for people with the same issues and post it in here?

Pretty much

Yeah and just roll your eyes and wait for that asshole to leave. I have been in a group where they were all assholes.

I would use a roaming super with a long duration such as spectral blades, dawnblade or fists of havoc, depending on ur class. This way you can just pick up the notes off the guy u kill right then and there.

Or they only had 1 character and created their second

It is a rare occurrence where it procs a necromatic explosion like the exotic Necrochasm from D1 which would cause cursed thrall explosions upon precision kills. It's likely just a bug, but a welcome one.

Same. I usually pump a lot into armor and recovery. I can't say much to the weapon loadout because it's the playstyle I like, but I typically run an assault rifle, a bow with explosive head, and a high dps power. Armour typically caters to this as well.
---
I enjoy using Fr0st-EE5 paired with 5 Paragon mods and Marksman‚Äôs Dodge.  I have my dodge back within ~7-10 seconds of using it, which means I never have to suffer through reload speeds of any weapon. 
---
Crucible:  Using the Nightstalker subclass allows me to go invisible nearly indefinitely.  This makes you disappear from enemy radar, which has been extremely useful for me.  The only downside is that the super isn‚Äôt very viable, but I don‚Äôt use it that often anyway.
---
PVE:  Same benefits as above for the most part, but the super is much more viable.
---
Just in it for those clan perks. I was in a clan kind of like that. They'd take one or two people every now and then but it was always them making plans. They wouldn't respond to anyone else asking for help on anything. The clan started falling apart because people stopped being active and finally the problem group left because they thought the clan wasn't active enough. And I'm just like "that's because you don't ever want to play with anyone else in the clan so of course they don't seem active."
---
Do you brag about cheating your way through life as well?.  Hope Bungie punishes you and takes all your ill gotten tributes away.

---
While I do agree somewhat, I think it's important that you feel comfortable using a certain gun. I have played lots of matches with weapons I wouldn't otherwise use except that pinnacle quests or catalysts required it. I have cursed many a weapon for me not being able to use it properly. Like the snipers, as soon as I get the kills done I will probably switch back to pulse/fusion or possibly hand cannon/shotgun. What I won't be doing, is trying to use a long range weapon on a short range map like I'm doing now.
---
Sidearms are amazing primaries to DPS. And personally, I rock a ranged-out Anonymous Autumn in PvP with my sniper (since Season 5, baby!). I think they‚Äôre fine as is, to be honest.

Thanks

At least she gets kills then

Indeed, but a recent Starbreeze meeting they made the statement that their last hope will be the Payday series (paraphrasing, of course). They been working on Payday 3 for 2 years (well, with all the engine changes and who knows what else, they probably only been working on it for like 6 months...I just know there was a leak for PD3 about 2 years ago back when I was still very active in the subreddit and playing it regularly).
---
Bottom line, sounds like Starbreeze is leaning heavily on PD to try and get them out of the mess they're in...so we'll see what happens because only Starbreeze/OVK knows what's going on behind those development doors.

And you expect us hunter s to do all the work, after what they did to orpheus, thats why were here isnt it to get our pre nerfed exotics back and possibly a vex mythoclast on the side

They could just merge the first two games with an  a la carte DLC policy and PC players would eat it up. The current engine should hold up for several more years. Payday 2 still has a decent amount of players despite showing its age pretty bad now.

I feel like some of ya'll really just don't understand that changing the Menagerie is NOT good for the game's health, people will no longer go into the menagerie any more unless to get their weekly powerful.

Here is an example that should make some of ya'll understand. Waking Vigil is definitely one of the best secondary energy hand cannons in the game, anyone with one should know that. The god roll for that weapon is 3 different scopes, ricochet rounds, opening shot, and slide shot. Now doing basic probability, statistically speaking, the chance of getting the god roll is 3/1000 or 1/333. Which means every 1000 Waking Vigils you get, 3 will be a god role. And that is only the probability, not the drop rate. Now with the old Menagerie chest, you could get maybe 5 drops per run. so that means that it would take around 67 Menagerie runs to get the god roll (statistically). and 10 minutes per Menagerie + 2 minutes of delay means it would take 13 hours to get the god role. With the new Menagerie, it will take 67 hours. 67 HOURS! More likely though, you will get your god role in about 150-250 drops, like Mtashed who got his in about 170 drops or 34 menagerie runs. But that is still crazy. Because it now takes nearly 5x the amount of time and runs.
---
Before, going into the menagerie was rewarding because even though there was a 3/1000 chance to get something I want, I knew that it was a lot more likely to get it than how it would be with a single drop. Secondly sifting through all my rolls was so rewarding and satisfying, when you finally found the god role. And lastly yes the chest glitch was not intended by the Bungie developers, but KackisHD said it best in his video, "If the game was played as intended, we would all be running around with double primary and fixed roles on our armor".
---
Also, I am not a developer, but I feel like Bungie could have thrown in a patch for LoW, Bottom tree striker, and Dawnblade in patch [2.5.1.1](https://2.5.1.1/) Again, I don't know how hard it is to change it but, it is your game Bungie ;)
---
Considering the pre-order on steam is only 60 as opposed to something outrageous like 79-99, it might be worth it. But everyone else is right, best to try it out first. I'll probably pre-order because I know I'll play regardless and I know it's a decent deal in a sea of stupid games for much higher prices.
---
I HOPE we get those exotics back from this, you wanna help me find the secret sparrow? I've heard it's one of the best sparrows aesthetically
---
Bro this is a 500 000 people fireteam. Im sure u will have infinite super anyways.
---
How bout you don't steal people's posts? You knew it was a repost and did it anyway.  Be original dude
---
I do like how they made the illusionary Mara look manic compared to her real self.
---
Blow me, background character
---
question, is there any reason to buy forsaken etc right now if i only own the base game and want to casually reroll a character right now? does forsaken add anything substantial to the lower level experience that makes it worth getting for me at this point?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm asking because i bought d2 at launch but stopped playing, but my girlfriend never realised she grabbed the bnet gift in december, so we decided to play d2 together and just start over.
---
but im wondering if we can just start over with the base game for now to get a feel of it &amp; buy forsaken later, or if we're really missing out on good things without forsaken in the lower level experience?
---
It's not even funny to begin with (unless you're 7)
---
Nananananananananana BAT-SCORN!
---
Whatever, dickless
---
I have hundreds of hours in destiny and I have no idea what this is. Looks like I‚Äôve got a new mission on my hands
---
Hunters dominate all of crucible on console for every titan or warlock there‚Äôs two hunters
---
Same man, I've said that since D1. Exploring the city and seeing what life for the people that live there would be awesome.
---
That Zavala face never fails to make me smile
---
That is one genuinely boring comeback.
---
Alright you win, you're the biggest dipshit here.
---
It was a close racr, but you earned it.
---
Thanks man i also got ward of dawn for when they launch golden guns
---
My advice: Go for the cursbreakee title, not the wayfarer. Wayfarer is multi layer RNG hell.
---
Ehh? Ah man I was just sleepin' bro
---
Did they give that to you for free? Or did they just supply you with the code to buy it?
---
Don‚Äôt think this is the case, was always going to be a 10 year plan with 3 games. Personally, I would prefer they make a great foundation in the next Destiny installment and add to it indefinitely, the D1/D2 cycle to me is stupid as you have to clear the slate at the start of every game and how many times are we going to let our banks get destroyed? I feel that with D1 and D2 they weren‚Äôt abled to set the groundwork in the way that sets them up to see out their vision so make D3 a ‚ÄòDestiny Online‚Äô or something along those lines and update it for the next decade instead.
---
*looks at the wonky knifes from hunters and syntotheps titans,plus the fact warlock melee has the longest recovery*
---
Yea no,i played all 3 and warlock melee effects are eh at best
---
code to buy, but its not really expensive
---
And while they're at it, make reckoning T3 either 100% drop rate or if you don't get it this run then 100% next run. It's not like we get to choose what boss is available each week nor are we choosing the exact weapon we get or even it's masterwork. I understand the need to grind but I know people who have actually grinded reckoning and aren't even close to a roll they want
---

One time I was in a rumble match with 4 AFKers and one god tier player who had the Unbroken title and a real honest to god Not Forgotten. I spent the whole time hiding from them and trying to farm the AFKers. 
---
Another time I was in a rumble match with 4 AFKers and a "bought forgotten," meaning someone who did not honestly earn the gun. They left after I killed them a few times.
---
It makes perfect sense wtf
---
If games like WoW are still going then Destiny will be around for a long time as long as they make the right decisions
---
That's what I want! I want to know what life is like for people who don't have abilities through the light.
---
Only drops from 3 resets
---
What's the point of doing such bullshittery?
---
With code it‚Äôs $20 plus shipping.  It‚Äôs not otherwise available directly from Bungie.
---
Holy cow. I just looked up the criteria and you‚Äôve done some serious grinding. Well done, I‚Äôm proud of what you‚Äôve accomplished here
---
Still less boring than your existence. I'm genuinely sorry for your parents. First the abortion fails, then their kid grows up to become you? Their languish must be goddamn immeasurable.
---
How do you get not kicked out?
---
thx^^
---
No, that is exactly what you did
---
From experience, you can get the helmets to drop from the activity like any other armor piece. So I'd suggest doing those bounties but maybe grinding a few runs out too to see if RNGezus is with you
---
I think you're being far too hopeful.
---
I think they'll keep making us dump everything so the workload is easier on them.
---
I agree that the cycle plan was probably the plan from the start, but do you not remember the whole first year where the general consensus was it would be one solid game.
---
They made several posts about it, it was mentioned at E3 and Deej even talked about it.
---
Maybe they can remaster D1 one day with updated graphics and high frame rates.
---
Oh Anthem. You had so much potential.
---
My beautiful, beautiful horn?
---
just didn't want to spend ages farming it without a powerful frame if there was no chance of it dropping without one
---
You gotta have a powerful weapon frame on you when you do the bergusia forge to get jotunn, that way you cant just do the forge over and over again
---
Pray to RNGeezus
---
Do i need playstation plus to join the fireteam ?
---
Yea

I'm having a very annoying issue with my game that is rendering it unplayable. I can load up Destiny, choose my character &amp; load into orbit just fine but once i select a location &amp; show up on the planet my entire screen goes black. It stays black for about 5 seconds then i will get my normal screen back, only to have the screen go black again after about 1 second maybe 2. While the screen is black I can still move about &amp; talk to vendors, using that 2 second window to tell where I'm going but once this starts, it either does not stop or maybe it does but t takes so long I already have the game closed. 
---
This has happened once before &amp; I fixed it by running the "scan &amp; repair" option on battlenet but trying that again this time did nothing for me.
---
The hunter's the one that blows himself up to stick the raid banner in the worst spot ever.
---
2 days ago they asked, Well, who's in charge of the hive. Oryx and his sisters. Who's Oryx and his sisters?

Well.... Oryx was......
---
Blueberry here. How do you plant a raid banner?

I want more of these planets opened up. Especially Titan. There's a gigantic sea...*creature* just chilling below The Rig. An gigantic dome/habitat unexplored. I want to know/see more.

You're the reason Gambit sucks right now. BANK YOUR F*CKING MOTES!!!!!
---
Running is a victory
---
I guess you didnt read the bigger issue is being matched unevenly meaning my team is short one or even two people at times exspecially on a game mode with minimal lives is fucking stupid I have played a ton of other fps games and have never experienced this level of shit tier matchmaking how the fuck am I supposed to "git gud" If I can barely play a match long enough without my team rage quitting and or doing nothing and fyi not everyone can find a consistent team to play at the exact same time people have schedules and lives.
---
"i've been downvoted!"
---
This is me most of the time. I don't like bows, and I ground out the Tribute this weekend. :p
---
so to translate: whenever a void titan, regardless of subclass, gets a melee kill, it recharges their shield throw, and whenever they kill something with the shield throw, it recharges their super?
---
I will launch it 50 up in the air at a 73 degree angle away from any outcropping ledge for you to jump from.

Oof, that hurts. I usually bank at 10 to make sure I can pick up and bank more.

Bank your motes. *Cocks gun* DO IT!!!!

The forge exotics require you to be forging a powerful frame, as [confirmed by bungie.](https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1076221329689403392?s=19) Many people are mistaken when they think they did not have a powerful frame, but they actually did. Frames used to be a super buggy convoluted mess right when black armory released, which is why this happened. At the time, if you saved a frame across weekly resets, it would spontaneously turn powerful, but prevent you from being able to buy any new frames, for example.
---
Don‚Äôt forget about a sparrow made of diamonds for shits and giggles
---
Let me clear this up a bit. Yes, the helmet drops from the weeklies are based upon whether or not you've gotten earlier tiers of the helmet. However, with each synthesizer upgrade, all the helmets of the previous tier are then added into the reckoning loot pool of their respective tier. If you want Notorious helmets, you don't have to spend weeks doing all the bounties for each tier, just farm Tier II until you get the helmet, then do the weekly for the Notorious.
---
TL;DR
---
1. Get Powerful Synthesizer
---
2. Farm Tier II for Outlawed Helmets first
---
3. Then complete weekly bounties for Notorious Helmets
---
Thx man needed this

No problem!  Should be pretty easy to find out now that you know what to look for!  The season of opulence starter quests to get to 690 takes about thirty minutes to complete.
---
How are people this oblivious to you running around like that?
---
Probably would be easier to just allow people to place any armor piece in a Transmogrification slot like ornaments ü§î
---
It's just the fact that Bungie makes it *real* difficult to actually access, at least in game. I have so many incomplete lore books because they're RNG based or tied to this or that tedious chore.
---
So that in mind, unless I have a full lore book I'm just never going to read it. Bungie really ought to revisit some of the older ones and make them more attainable like they did with the Dreaming City one.
---
I've watched it ten times, it was very good.
---
Oh no I‚Äôd call it a fact, but just about any time I bring it up I get downvoted and there‚Äôs about a dozen or so ‚ÄúNo it‚Äôs really EAs fault‚Äù types that come out of the woodwork.
---
i just edited my comment for the weapons thing. You can dismantle a lot of weaponsthat don‚Äôt fit your playstyle or are just bad, if they become meta you‚Äôll be able to get another easy
---
Right? But wait for everyone else to chime in "titans are fine", "you suck if you let them get that close", etc.
---
Honestly. It‚Äôs annoying that there always has to be someone to ruin it
---
So I did the bounty for the helmet and got illicit helmet not notorious...do I have to do that every week until notorious?
---
How can I suck if I can't see the fuckwad because I'm shooting someone else?
---
It has to be a tier 3 set, the "notorious" gear
---
imagine having died to the same super 3 times..
---
With a sniper kinetic, riskrunner and a linear fusion heavy you can solo bergusia
---
Well not really. While they didnt have names for the classes, they did still only use abilities and traits pertaining to what we know as the three classes. Its more likely that someones connection to the light as well as character is what determines their ‚Äúclass‚Äù as we know when shin malphur became a light bearer he didnt have a ghost or any real relation to the vanguard, but before he was a human gunslinger learning under jared hence why he became a hunter under golden gun class. All these three connections and classes harken back to the three people who first encountered the traveler, they were the taikonaut cosmonaut and astronaut. As for people using different abilities, we have only seen one case of something like that and it was with felwinter who was a warlock who shoulder charged once i believe. This is also why hunters cant really blink like warlocks who teleport. While hunters can blink as they learned/copied it from the warlocks, its more like their speed allows them to be able to blink as their blinks appear more like a blur rather than a flat out teleport. They cant do the actual blink since they arent a warlock and dont really have the connection or abilities to allow them to teleport. This is an example of a restriction that defines the 3 classes.
---
Can you just enjoy the meme and move the fuck on? I don‚Äôt support stonetoss either, but it‚Äôs just a format ffs. Grow up
---
I'm quite sure that the majority of gaming community is far beyond any meme-joke representation of it, and actually mature enough to understand what happened in this case.
---
Ok so its pretty hard to do but, you gotta make a new character, then when you experience the traveler vision after homecoming you gotta quickly grab all 5 pieces of the wrecked suit from collections (you cant do it during homecoming, its not unlocked until the traveller cutscene plays), then transfer all the gear to your vault, afterwards you can transfer it to your main guardian (or whatever class you were trying to get the gear for), it only has 100 power so with 700 weapons and a class item, itll get you around 400-450, so you can do strikes, crucible and run around the tangled shore with the set, until shadowkeep comes out with a power increase (which might be 1000 or 850) which probably will get you to 600 power
---

---
I wish they would update that year 1 crucible titan armor. I loved the look of it.
---
&gt;I tried starting a nightfall with two buddies and wiping immediately after opening the chest but that didint work.
---
Being able to open the chest at the end multiple times was a bug exclusive to Hollowed Lair which was patched months ago. It didn't apply to any other strike, and I don't know if it counted for the loaded question quest.
---
Boo
---
Well fuck I already have 3 max characters.
---
Thanks man
---
Straight facts on this one. Someone always gotta ruin it, man
---
I know, it's super annoying to get blind sided by a melee. Then people say "well, hunters get liar's handshake, that's s one hit!" and not exactly, a hunter has to get punched first for it to work, and against a titan that's just not gonna work
---
that looks super fun lol
---
Imagine if those guys had shotguns. I'm just saying.
---
üóø ohhh....  FUCK
---
Downvote and move on then, Stonetoss can't hear you here.
---
My exact words. My synth is only tier 2 and I'm crying. We have until August 27th though, so it should be doable !

Three weeks

Post the rest of the steps? Or better yet, do a new one and take screenshots every 30 mins and do a progression gif/ chart
---
I read this in nKuch‚Äôs voice., god that man‚Äôs insufferable.
---
Theres nothing wrong with using the Dredgen title. If someone is shaming you over using a slightly easier to get title they're just an insecure manchild.
---
Liar's Handshake is also not an ability. It's a conditional augment. That Arc charge isn't.
---
That one was really annoying for me too. Sometimes mote-carrying guardians just don't drop em.
---
Yes

So I‚Äôm not alone

Not gonna knock your choice but Oxygen isn't great in any activity, let alone Gambit. If you want a better alternative try Polaris Lance, it hits harder, has a better explosion, better range, and works well for invading and ad clearing.

And it still sucks

If they introduced dual wielding side arms, I would use the shit out of them. I would make a hunter for that EXACT purpose of looking awesome and dual wielding. BUNGIE!!!! MAKE THIS HAPPEN!!!

Truth is a beast in gambit. Hammerhead is always a good choice. I'm basing both of these on invading/anti-invader choices, there's better boss dps choices probably
---
I meet 1 of those
---
Depends because Truth is a guardian killer but not great on primeval and wendigo or a grenade launcher with spike is a cracker for finishing

Is that their clan motto or clan about field? With all the requirements

The rate of fire. Look at the stats of your gun and you will see it above mag count. 110 is mostly used for pve (duke mk44) 140 and 150 (austinger and rose) are a good balance for both and 180 (trust) tend to feel better in pvp but also viable for pve

Its funny, just around the same time as bungje leaving Activision, and things started going well for the game, the hate Warframe had for destiny started going away and being replaced with... Companionship? I dont know why but the players have started being nice to each other...  And om happy about it
---
I can only speak for myself-- but I don't do raids, none of my friends play, and I still get hours and hours per week of entertainment from this game (i've been playing since launch). Apart from the occasional lfg for exotic quests I'm perfectly content playing solo
---
This belongs in comedy cemetery.

I know! It's like sometimes the game decides to actually take into account that someone made it to cover before the knife was even near them. Deplorable, I know, but sometimes this game just doesn't function the way it shouldn't.

i remember that but never even heard " destinykiller" other than the jokes from my clanmates

I haven't seen anyone from the Warframe community say that, mostly just "destiny isn't my game"

Right?? I jus wanna get lost in there for days! (Knowing I have access to my ship any time of course :P)

---
Ok, couple of points here. I just checked and the option is to abandon the item which I did, but when I did that it did not refund me a ballistics log it refunded me a modulus report. Some of the frames require a ballistics log and some of them require a ballistics log, not quite sure why that is. The description on the Machine Gun Frame says that it will refund a ballistics log on weekly reset. I already had plenty of modulus reports, but I did not have a ballistics log so I could not choose some of the frames. Anyway long story short, I got a Sniper Rifle frame using a Modulus report which says in the description that it too refunds a ballistics log on weekly reset. I'm going to wait till tomorrow to see if I get a Ballistics log which is what I really want. If not I'm only out a modulus report, I have plenty of those.
