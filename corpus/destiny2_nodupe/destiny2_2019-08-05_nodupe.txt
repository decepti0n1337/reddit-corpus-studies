When you are in an area with many enemies and you die to a shank
---
---
---
A grind it is.  I just finished getting the set on my hunter, and the only thing I want now is to not play Destiny 2 again.  Good job Bungie!
---

---
Can't wait for Borderlands 2 to come out!
---
Made with mematic
---
Lol, That one Guardian that hops into frame and turns quickly towards them
---
Gotta flex the grind just a lil bit ü§´
---
It's much easier to progress the event (by killing the enemies and the domes) until the third phase and THEN shoot the angry sky orb. You'll use way less ammo that way.
---
Warlock please!!!
---
Most towers I'm in are dead
---
it so **FUN** grinding this when i only have 2 hours a day to play and its on xbox so load times are **FUN** 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
**END ME**
---
If you need to purchase the game...  wait until October, if you already have a copy of the game, jump in and give it a go.  
---
For me I play for the raiding with my clan, the guns that do the pew pew, the big numbers, the loot and most importantly...   the grind.    Some people enjoy the lore, I am more interested in the gear drops and triumphs.   Some people play for the pvp, I am definitely not one of those people, I love the PvE.
---
It ricochets ???!??!
---
Thanks man. Just makes me sad that the forsaken enemies take up the same loot table as the vanilla ones. So if the forsaken version of the black exodus high value target spawns the vanilla cant and it spawns so much more often. I think going to trost EDZ works but ill try giant scar/lost oasis too.
---
Im curious why its bugged. Kinda a big problem yknow.. gives people the wrong idea and if they dont know they could potentially think something else is a high value target and its just a vicious cycle. Thank you for the information though i appreciate it
---
It gave you the momentum you needed
---
It‚Äôs actually the rose with frumious blue
---
I‚Äôm not complaining about losing for losing, i‚Äôm complaining about unfairly losing due to an imbalance in team members, which is on bungie, not me.
---
Yeah I remember looking up some lore and I know that Dead Orbit was mentioned but dont know their involvement
---
You took on 2 supers and still had 1/3 of the bar left? Amazing *cries in titan bubble*
---
I think that the one of the nine that helped him did so because they either didnt believe or wanted to test the whole "we cant exist without life in the system" fact
---
Provided what I read was right, you remember Outbound Signal? How the Dantalion Exodus VI was transmitting somewhere out into space? Apparently they were contacting the Red Legion for assistance and Dead Orbit intercepted the transmission; I also heard DO fought the Legion on their way to Earth but I'm not sure if that part's true.
---
You must not look at the comments on posts about titans in PvP and PvE
---
I just like to post about easy collection grabs
---
So i'll tell you again the way to remady that is to get a team. The reason you are not getting full teams is half on bungie amd half on the fact that compared to 4 stacks no one is really solo queing at this point in the season
---
My mum put a sparkler in my pizza and sang happy birthday
---
could it just be u put on some blue armor and took a pic
---
Either way fuck that one of the Nine
---
Imagine seeing a bunch of fully armed soldiers walking around a mall like a train or dancing different dances from each other without any music and the occasional 2 soldiers trying but failing to sync their dance moves.
---
Thats what guardians would look like in present day
---
We've been through the bad and the good together, guardian.
---
Thanks!
---
Ok see you love destiny, right?
---
Oof
---
Nice
---
I'm sorry my friend, for I am guilty. I've %100 been punching down Titans while screaming, #THAT'S HOW IT FEELS#
---
Just warlock things
---
F
---
That‚Äôs awesome. I think everyone in this Sub reddit should post their best tower encounters with other guardians
---
Well put brotha
---
Where is that backdrop?
---
Snipers, grenade launchers.
---
No other friends and lfg is ass
---
Kills at the European Aerial Zone as void subclass. 
---
If you inspect the armor it tells you more about each step.
---
Xbox
---
Explosive kills in the EAZ as a void subclass. Void warp and grenades, grenade launchers should count as long as you have a void subclass on.
---

---
Got it. Ok cool!
---
"laughs in 20k+ gunsmith mats"
---
Cheese Forever on YouTube
---
If you need a primary farm a blast furnace with kill clip and feeding frenzy. If you're lucky it'll have high range and a range mw too. Super good
---
It is the kinetic symbol if I am not mistaken.
---
Just use a gun from your first slot while in a void subclass.
---
*dredgen is playing with fire*
---
Yeap, I actually handed in some of my 1000's the other day, honestly just to get rid of the markers in the tower.
---
Copied and pasted from every time someone asks this:
---
Year 1 content is going free to play in September. For the time being, to prevent people from buying DLC and not being able to play it until the game goes free, the year 1 content is included with every Forsaken purchase for free.
---
You could buy the "complete collection" through the official store for your platform. This is $40 for both Forsaken and the annual pass.
---
You could buy the "legendary edition" and get just Forsaken from third party vendors. The annual pass sold separately from official vendors is $15, but you can't play it without Forsaken.
---
Does the FAQ stickied to this subreddit help at all?
---
IKELOS is oddly better for me. Quicker results and big rate of fire.
---
Go to the item details page (the Y button) and it will tell you. The explosion is the generic "any sort of kill" icon. The circle means void.
---
It was in duo my dude, and I lost sometimes too.
---
Yes.
---
Thank you
---
The bunnies are a cute addition, it's a limited time item that not everyone will be able to get which will make it rare depending on how many people have it at the end of the event, Other than that "Always on time" looks like a better sparrow.
---
I've learned how to ignore the the Shaxx, Zavala and Bashee markers. It annoyed the shit out of me at first but I've been ignoring them for so long I don't even notice them anymore.
---
Thank you Kanye very cool
---
I just wanna go back to honking at moon-gregs like in D1 :(
---
I feel bad trying to dodge to reload after a kill, but my dodge isn't charged so it looks like I'm t bagging. Sorry to anyone I've accidentally done that to
---
WtfüòÇ that you even had the stomach to do that..
---
The hood made me look like a ninja lmao
---
WHAT
---
After further research, it looks like they do have to match your subclass. All other orbs don't count.
---
What?
---
How did you keep your sanity? It was hard enough for me to do one
---
You're correct. I did a bit more research and it has to match your subclass.
---
For the orbs I‚Äôm planing to complete the playlist requirements then if I need more I‚Äôll go farm thrall in escalation protocol
---
No one cares about rarity. If it's a limited time item and requires lots of effort to get then that only strengthens my point.
---
Hover over Sloane and see if the ‚ÄúEnemy of my Enemy‚Äù quest is above her. Do that quest to the end and don‚Äôt kill mithrax. Kill the Knight. Then go back in patrol to the door to pick up the item.
---
Riskrunner is fantastic and easily one of my favorite weapons for PvE.
---
Ah, well, that sucks. Tomorrow is Solar, my advice, pop in and out of strikes till you get corrupted, then do blind well.
---
Graviton Lance is my favorite of the 3.   But really all 3 are good for PvE.
---
Do you not have Chaperone? The quest is so easy lol
---
I used tether with Orpheus rigs and shotty to clear the trash and knights, then Sleeper to take down Dul Incaru. It worked most consistently for me, and I tried Celestial and Riskrunner but had trouble getting to the damage phase.
---
Personally I love all three but I love my Titan the most because of the sentinel class. Nothing is more satisfying then protecting your team, giving them a weapon damage buff, and generating like 7 orbs by just holding one button. I am like super Captain America lol
---
Paying 15k to get all glow sets, that's idiotic. That more than half of all my bright dust.
---
I work graveyard shift at Walmart so I understand that. Beside having a kid most times I'm tired as all heck.
---
No it‚Äôs 5k not 15
---
is that passive roll good ??
---
Graviton lance
---
From what I can tell it does nothing essentially
---
why would you want ads attacking you while you‚Äôre on it ? wouldn‚Äôt it blow up and you might die
---
I feel like they‚Äôre too rare to constantly be dupes
---
Graviton lance is good for both.
---
no, actually you didn't lol every comment is timestamped.
---
Oh they definitley still shoot at you, but theres really no reason not to run it so just eh why not
---
Warlock because mage and because pocket healing.
---
I dont even run SC anymore. It's a noob move. I rarely die by it,.
---
Finally, I was upvote 69.
---
Wtf
---
Same. I'm liking my sticky MT and Recluse but... that's probably sweaty. Got em a few weeks ago and been enjoying. Lol.
---
Now masterwork it. But GJ on getting the set complete. Finished mine today as well.
---
If you are Warlock we get good armour. Do the event
---
I had to repair my house in order to refinance it. I was really excited when our came time to refinish my floors today because I got to kick my family out due to the fumes and I got to play (for the first time in weeks)  for 2 hours between each coat. 
---
I wish this unexplainable headache would go away though...
---
thanks!!
---
I'm a titan, so is it still good?
---
I wish OEM was actually as OP as people say it is, so I wouldn't suck at PvP anymore.
---
Then I don't need The Recluse if it takes being a meta slave to win.
---
Its quick play tho right? I'm on my blue gear and already have legend rank so I'm just holding it untill the next set to have it ready to use.
---
If you reset your valor rank 10 times you get a quest from Shaxx, sending you to the spider to retrieve his ‚Äòmedicine‚Äô
---
What is that?
---
I found a blue weed engram, but it‚Äôs low level
---
I suck at PvP and had to kill guys in Crucible. Shoulder Charge was my only hope. I'm sorry :(
---
You can always try BadDragon for something similar looking
---
You can catch me with sedia, she already screaming befor you do anything
---
That's awesome üòÇ
---
Lol
---
Exactly!
---
*nice intensifies*
---
Is that a cat? X.x
---
"Hey... Uh, I can't find the last chest, anyone seen it on their side?"
---
The t h i c k word
---
Probably based on needing to go to titan, which of the three classes provides the least public events and patrols, which can make that part way worse.  They also have to kill hive as their enemy, which they are not easily available on titan to the same level as Cabsl on EDZ (of course titans are not in a great spot either as they have to go to Io, but kill fallen, so they cannot be done concurrently).  Hunter is the easiest, but it's minor in the long run.
---
nice
---
I want the hunter one so bad. I‚Äôm on the blue set of armour, and the one I‚Äôm really stuck on is the 100 mini bosses challenge. Like how the hell can you do it? I know it‚Äôs possible but it‚Äôs quite frustrating tbh!
---
Which shader is that?
---
I've recently played through the story solo. As someone else suggested, just make sure you're above the recommended light level.
---
Out of every post I‚Äôve ever made, that one was the one to become the most popular 
---
I mean, I‚Äôm not complaining, but wow.
---
If you played this week you‚Äôll get 50 points apon reset so yes you‚Äôll make it
---
It's fucking stupid and frustrating. People want free rides and carries because they can't be bothered to grind!
---
Yeah you‚Äôre good, it‚Äôs an increase of 120 and fabled is at 2100.
---
Really happy about this :) been grinding my ass off for this gun. 
---
Now i just need to wait and see how bungie change that mountaintop quest üôÑ
---
well yes, but actually no
---
No not on Xbox
---
I mean what do you think her stone is for, that definitely went into something
---
Playd all day saturday and sunday grinding solstice gear and didnt drop any exotics ü§î
---
i thought that stone was a chip off Croata's soul crystal thing. even if its not i think there are better shaped "rocks" to fit her needs.
---
I played non-stop since the event dropped. 
---
I was by no means the most efficient tho
---
Hunter took 2 days
---
Warlock took 3
---
Titan took 2
---
Lmao
---
Extremely
---
It‚Äôs meant to be what‚Äôs chambered, but since she did it from screenshots it‚Äôs a bit hard
---
Yeah she is amazing!
---
 Almost there too. A few more objectives left and I can sleep finally
---
I‚Äôm neither toxic, afk or annoying
---
But yes this picture was taken quite a while ago. In fact last year. Since last word was released in destiny 2 I felt that this was suitable to post here.
---
Don‚Äôt use drop mag with it but it pretty fun if you have hand cannon ammo scavenger
---
Also, someone did the math recently, the always on time, gives more of a buff than the voidstreak, I think voidstreak is 1.5 Less damage, while Always on time is 2x less damage
---
I have always loved using rogue/assassin type characters in every rpg game that allows me to pick one, so hunter was the obvious choice. Shit since beginning of d1 I have never used my warlock, and titan I made, just my hunter.
---
this isn't even my final form
---
Can't fix recluse unless Bungie gives it the reddrix treatment. However, I am pretty sure revoker will probably be the new standard going forward. A grind bar like all the other mode pinnacles rather than a pure skill bar like recluse, Luna's, NF, etc.
---
Noice!
---
I got it
---
Up next is 69069
---
Nice.
---
you don't need to masterwork the armor to get the sparrow
---
If you move your ps4 character to your pc then yes, your pc characters will be gone and replaced with your ps4 ones.
---
Imma try this. Thanks
---
You will choose 1 "main account" that you then can move to whatever platform you want to play on.
---
We need full lyrics
---
Please
---
How then?
---
I'd say top tree hammer cause of melting point
---
its 800 silver or 5000 bright dust.
---
The first mission on this DLC is on Earth - after that Mercury will be unlocked.
---
Yeah you'll get it.  
---
If when you login in tomorrow you don't see the Triumph, don't panic. Just go back to orbit or log off and log back in. The triumph will unlock and the recluse will be yours :)
---
Thanks for the "advice".
---
Makes alot of sense, never thought of that
---
Ok
---
Maybe get a second chest piece with a different glow and let that switch with the api? :D
---
Hunter. Because of the class ability. It allowed me to have a panic button when I run out of ammo in pve. And when I round a corner and see 4 red dots in crucible, it allows me to nope the fuck out of there by rolling on the ground like a 4 year old on a tantrum.
---
I got this and I think you got it from a Valor earnings rank of some sort, idk which rank tho.
---
Its seems like its listed in what to do where at the same time. Example, it lists all the strike ones in one area instead of listing each item per armor piece.
---
you kinda have to 4 stack at this point, 1500 and up is roughly where you start facing fabled and up players due to matchmaking. if your skills aren't good enough to carry the match then you'll have to rely on good communication to give you the edge. only other tip i have aside from 4 stacking is to learn the maps and spawns. if you know when spawns are going to flip or where most players funnel down, you can plan accordingly and ambush the enemy.
---
Oh so *that's* how I died! Thought it was just a glitch!
---
The game used to be do a public event and get an exotic so I like this way much better
---
Just Titan things
---
Exotics no longer drop from public events? I didn't know this.
---
Watch some YouTubers, like Cammy Cakes, Drewskey, Hush, old Kruser and Sir D (I say old because they have sniping tips), TrueVanguard, etc.
---
Then try to find weapons you will like, just know a good smg can out kill a shotgun, but only if you know how to use it. But there isn't anything wrong with meta weapon usage, they are good and reliable and can keep you alive in comp.
---
Lastly, have a good team; not best stats, but people you would want to grind with. If you have friends that want to improve too, fun to be with, and will try to stay calm in high tilt situations, PLAY WITH THEM. Early D2 had trials, and having a consistent team helped you get to know each other which can help you play better because you get to know each others call out, and have a good team Chem. Lfg'ing for teams isn't bad, but you might not have a good team chemistry as much as some good friends can.
---
Tl;Dr YouTube, experimentation, teamwork.
---
No it does but it used to be they drop all the time. What didn‚Äôt get from what I said
---
Every time I see a cake like this all I can think about is wow looks cool. Bet it tastes like strait fondant.
---
Ah ok, I understand. Apologies.
---
lake of shadows nightfall was up 3 or 4 weeks ago i think.
---
Shaxx is awesome.   The guy who plays his voice is Morgan from Walking Dead.
---
Zvalla needs to go though.   he and ikora have both become useless.  they used to run the place.  its not like it used to be.  their time has come
---
is this needed for endgame or i better of play hunter or warlock? do people need titan?
---
For endgame? No titans really aren‚Äôt in meta warlocks can do everything better (with Luna‚Äôs) and melting point isn‚Äôt necessary when you have someone using tractor cannon. But I mean titans aren‚Äôt terrible
---
Destiny 2 is a good game but I'm not coming back until shadow keep also division 2 didn't fail it's gotten better.
---
Why cant Gina Torres play Ikora seen as Ikora‚Äôs appearance is based on Gina?
---
Division 2 is actually pretty fun if I'm honest
---
I just got the blue set for my Titan and with the Precursor Vector shader I think it looks amazing.  Clean and crisp like a wielder of light should look.
---
No
---
Damn my mom is addicted to meth and lost her job, So no bday present for my bday last month. FeelsBadMan
---
Idk, I'd be fine with her playing ikora
---
Not tempted to grind the solstice armour for 2.0?
---
Not worth it
---
I don‚Äôt understand what it is we‚Äôre looking at....
---
damn but at least you know your a beast of a guardian killing machine, right?
---
Loved the first one, played it all the way through on PS4. Bought the second one on PC, played it but got bored really quickly :(
---
It's my video game version of comfort food. If I get home from work and I just want to shut my brain off for a while I do a couple missions.
---
I'm on my 7th reset this season. Im having PTSD from iron banner still
---
When I'm not saving the universe as I Warlock I'm saving someone's car. Mechanic here.
---
That's one of the reasons I like gambit prime. You run away? That's 20 seconds you can't bank. You absolutely refuse to deal with me? I'm stealin your motes!
---
I mean, friendship is the true endgame here, always has been. Even the most hardcore solo runs had a friends to help them try their strats and revive them, like the latest riven cheese. I think shattered throne was the first true solo challenge the game has had.
---
Golden gun top tree(? The one with precision shot) and celestial
---
Dark!!!
---
They die if you hit your shots...which you eventually did anyway
---
Arc Hunter liars have shake cos curated shot gun
---
This guy was afk in a match of gambit. He messaged me 4hours later and instantly blocked me... I may have lost it, probably because this event is nothing else but a frustrating piece of repetitive un-fun grind....
---
Lmao damn
---
Big yeet
---
This, but he‚Äôs throwing out 8 edge transits and a pair of tangled web boots
---
It shoulda been ‚Äúwin 5‚Äù instead of ‚Äúcomplete 10‚Äù and then this wouldn‚Äôt happen. Or get a 3 streak or something of equivalent time investment but more exciting.
---
Deadass tea bagging is something you do to start a fight. Met a kid the other day that didn‚Äôt even understand why it was considered so disrespectful, smh
---
I was at 300 light back then and there is a lot going on in the game. I haven't enjoyed Destiny like I am doing now since Taken King and I am just looking to make the only stuff I hate go over quicker. I beat one but you needed to beat multiple lost sectors on mars and when you are level 30 and haven't maxed out your light yet the enemies are red and while it is possible it's really hard since the miniboss is beefy. I love how you say you are trying to be helpful and you just gave a half serious and not constructive answer to my question. I do enjoy the game and when I need help I want an answer and not someone sick of destiny hater venting on me even though I didn't show nor feel any hatred what soever to the game. Anymore at least. They really did a great job and if you want me to grind you can just put out an exclusive cosmetic and if the grind is reasonable I will infact grind. I don't like that you are forced to play PvP but whatever the challenges in PvP aren't too hard and I might even get into Gambit even though other players obliterate me currently because of my light being low. Don't get me wrong I appreciate everybody commenting but I get triggered when people make assumptions. In fact I am thankful for your previous comment because I will now complete the quest. Good day.
---
I've always had luck on the dreaming city when the enemies move against each other
---
I had 2 afkers in this gambit prime match I played the other day. Not bot afkers, but they just went on a ledge and stood there looking around. I banked 79 motes that game.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure ricochet rounds increases the damage drop off more.
---
Do history of red war like this like those ancoent paintings.
---
*falling with style*
---
Found the titan main.
---
^(Nah, I enjoy meleeing them with my knife as well)
---
Thanks! My personal favorite is the gunslinger art, as that was the first of these that I completed.
---
I‚Äôve found that with Destiny 2 now üòÇ especially now the solstice grind has started
---
Great idea. Win 5
---
Remember, the guardian kills also count if a teammate does it. Goes pretty quick in clash and control.
---
Wait, is there a shader like that?
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Okay I played Lockdown and just gor 9 kills so I guess I just had bad luck.
---
In all honesty, I couldn‚Äôt tell to begin with. Judging by the claws I‚Äôd say it is a cat. Don‚Äôt see many dogs trying to grab stuff with their paws.
---
It that the new exotic lmg lord of the dance?!?
---
for sure. our hunter runs it all the time
---
I played with TrueVanguard once. He has over 200k iirc
---
You just need to make sure you have all the legendary armor before the event ends. You can masterwork everything after the event ends. This has been confirmed by Bungie.
---
Boi trying to just piss everyone off now huh
---
No. But it ain't like Bungie can't make one.  Those are the colors of my beloved Marine Corps.
---
Hi there,  
---
we're a chilled clan that's been around since the beginning of D1. We're mostly based in the UK are play lots of PVE and PVP.  
---
Check us out on -

---
NNNNNNNNNNIIIIIIIIIICCCCCCCCCCEEEEEEEEEE
---
we run 2 titans 3 warlocks and 1 tether for raids. as long as you have one warlock and one titan should be fine. banner sheild and or meltingly point are required for some bosses
---
Nikki Menagerie? You deserve gold, alas all I have to offer is an updoot
---
Fuck I'm a warlock and I almost go out of my way to punch them
---
lmao.
---
Considering borderlands 2 is still going strong, I highly doubt borderlands 3 is going to die.
---
Mini boss assist?
---
This image emits such anxious energy
---
This is why I was so surprised by all the "are you SERIOUS bungie I can't do this!" Posts.
---
.....like....if you can't dedicate 5 hours a week to bang this out, how do you do anything in destiny?
---
I was able to get the first set done in 3 hours on my hunter, but that's about it. So I guess 9 hours for each set, multiply by 2 sets and by 3 again to get the total. So 54 hours... damn
---
Nazis on the frontier!
---
I didn't think it was hard, some of it was just really boring. Doing 25 patrols was my least favourite part I think. I also never want to play EAZ again.
---
Meanwhile, the current system almost enforces the "every man for themselves" mentality. 
---
AFKing really isn't that big of a deal. I'd rather do the work than spend my time ensuring I'm one step ahead of every blueberry that can't be bothered to work as a team or to at least wait for the others to get a hit in.
---
Thank you.
---
Lfg on the app as "no mic" and you at least know they will play.
---
Soltice
---
Are we not gonna talk about the fact that op invaded with 9 motes
---
It‚Äôs a new sparrow for Solstice of  Hero‚Äôs
---
*An outstanding move*
---
Same here
---
I see, is it easy to get or does it require a lot of grinding? Also can it be done at 600 Light level?
---
It's the Mico Mini sparrow and it's one of the cosmetic items from the Solstice of Heros. It still may be available for bright dust today.
---
That's....not really how it works. Every class has different objectives that can either increase the time or decrease. Additionally, that time could drastically change if you're playing other people who are helping each other work towards similar goals.
---
N O
---
for those who don't understand the words, the dude's name is 'your mom gay'
---
Right now you can buy it for 2.5k Bright Dust at eververse. So yes it can be done at 600 light and doesn‚Äôt require Grind at all unless you do Bounties to get that 2.5k
---
It's only been a week you still have like 3 weeks left more than enough time  oh no 100 minibosses except you're likely to get about 25 in one week
---
this is old news dude, just let it go
---
Sweet! If I remember I had like 10 of the stuff. Will pop on tonight but to grab one! Thank you!
---
1k voices has to get lucky and invade when they‚Äôre grouped.
---
QB was just nasty where you get an army of one almost every time  you invaded
---
It really needs a horn!
---
I'm not sure I understand what I'm looking at. Boss stomped. You got knocked away. Nothing new there. What am I missing?
---
i would stop playing it except every other exotic quest, event quest etc requires crucible (and or gambit). then there's the fact that some of the best weapons in the game require comp which takes the salt to a new level. i've ground out every single pinnacle weapon except NF and i seriously hate crucible now but i'm still gonna have to come back next season when they release some new must have weapon.
---
r/KilledByTheArchitects
---
Destiny @ crucible is just a META simulator, aka NOOB BATTLE ROYALE
---
Scooty puff jr. suuuuucccckkkkksssss
---
This sounds like an surprisingly solid idea, as long as (given they see this/you DM it to them or Twitter) Bungie doesn't fuck it up and nerf it later. I'd love this in the game, feel free to send this idea to them!
---
The only thing i see wrong with the grind is the EAZ mini boss step. They should've made allied boss kills count to your total and made the final boss worth like 5 kills to stop people leaving. Personally i hate the fact theres no event engram, but thats a whole different conversation
---
Man could solo The Darkness with a single super
---
I used graviton Lance and bad omens with tracking module and invaded at every possible time. It doesn't take long
---
GUARDIAN! THIS IS THE LAST OF MY LIGHT! TAKE IT FROM MEEEEEEE
---
Piep, piep.
---
Technically yes, you wont lose your gear on PC.
---
However, if you choose PS4 as your cross save, you will only be able to access/play with the gear and characters you have on PS4 across all platforms. 
---
Its speculated that your PC account gets archived and it may be possible to swap between your PC and ps4 accounts...but that would be kinda defeating the point of cross save. You're going to have to leave stuff behind, just choose (and for now play) on the account you have the most stuff on
---
Just do crucible with a squad full of recluse because teammate kills count as well. I had a six man and we all ran recluse and I got it done in a game and a half of crucible
---
Crucible is faster because teammate void kills count. And there is a lot more void kills in crucible(especially because of recluse)
---
Edit: For all those saying both i only had 5k dust so yea
---
Ada-1 is always offering her wares ....
---
That's what I was thinking. Thank you.
---
Married, working 60hours some weeks only 50, have a two year old and did it under 5 days, Player a little the first day, then hit it kinda hard over the weekend, even helped my wife and I already got the Legendary set for my Warlock, I'm thinking I might be able to get my other two Guardians done and help my wife with the time given for the event. The people bitching just want something to complain about.
---
Nova Warp is actually my favorite super and I think it's one of the very few roaming supers that's not completely broken. 
---
Still tho, could use some good exotics to make it viable in PvE.
---
Nice work btw.
---
They didn't add additional weeks though.
---
Parkour!
---
More hive eldritch horrors
---
They probably were just needing invade kills or waiting to invade
---
If I were going to do the leave strategy I‚Äôd do it with a team so nobody who wants to finish would be left alone
---
Ooh, das a dangerous cripple!
---
It works in theory, but then leads to the same people who afk leaving once they fall behind a little. So essentially we are back to square one.  
---
The requirements for gear like this definitely need a major overhaul, not sure how that would look though.
---
Maybe not the best, but Worldline Zero is so damn fun, especially with catalyst and on arc days
---
Ah I see now. This is the quote I read:
---
&gt; A: Cross Save does not feature any form of account, character, or progress merging. Selecting a set of characters for Cross Save does not delete or alter the data of any other character sets. Other character sets will be inaccessible for use as long as Cross Save is active. 
---
This states that it does not delete or change the PC only profile, but I missed the part where it says they are inaccessible while cross save is active. So you would have to disable cross save to gain access back to the PC only profile.
---
The data is still maintained though.
---
Only possibly to get 2 max stats and some change on the third option.
---
Radiolarian desensitizes, helps a guardian last longer.
---
I was leading my buddy through it for the first time last night and opted not to warn him when we got to the maze. His reaction was priceless. 
---
‚ÄúAre there enemies in here? Oh-OH GOD!!!‚Äù
---
*guardian down*
---
Doesn‚Äôt that assume people are always ready to just walk away from their game and do something else at any time? I‚Äôm sure some folks would do this but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a fair assumption that everyone would.
---
Not really, unless you need them for your 20 per week.  But with 8 forge, 7 Dreaming City, 5 Strike, 5 crucible, and 12 gambit bounties available that you can do while completeing various power engrams, they are usually not needed.
---
They do give 10 planetary materials each, so if you are low on a specific material and Spider is not selling what you need, you can always pick up the boutnies and do patrols while completing them to up your platenatry materials by about 50 pretty quickly.
---
&gt; No kids tho
---
That's all you had to say.
---
nah, arc webs are just weird like that
---
So we back in the... uhhh... ad clearing area? *no no no, that doesnt work* how about platform? *no that still doesnt work*
---
Or on that first platform, with an instant summon sparrow, place one sparrow in front of the launch ring and then summon again to use it as a ramp
---
Thats why I'm glad I'm on PS4. Going in solo with anarchy I was getting 8-10 a run. Plus I didn't ruin anyones game by leaving mid match.
---
Context please.
---
The only tough thing is the minibosses thecrest is grand
---
it does
---
Man, twitch must be rough these days.
---
Looks like moon rendering and public event/mode testing.
---
I have it its not the best
---
Is so annoying that I mute voices in crucible
---
It was for reaching ledgend in valor rank i think
---
dude, you need to make a youtube channel and just be your self, that was hilarious
---
Me riding my lil bros bicycle in a nutshell
---
Isnt saving the boxes untill you get legendary armor worth it? Apparently you can drop unlocked armor with different stats. But then again I feel you for the box farm.
---
Uh, yeah, they can.
---
The pictures are just showing you what they look like. If you read the description it specifically tells you that buying a glow pack unlocks it for use on all characters.
---
Ok so 
---
Nova and chaos do less damage than celestial celestial is the highest DPS super
---
Hunters have the one two punch strat titans and warlocks can't do that I tried
---
OH WOW WE HAVE TO BE SUPPORT SO HUNTERS CAN RELOAD EASILY
---
I don't know why people hate Gambit so much I think Its great and the match can turn in your favor if you invade at the right time but with some teams when you are down some motes some people seem to give up and you will never win games that way.
---
Each of the main planets has 3 bounties, 6 x 3 = 18. Dreaming city has 5, Zavala has 5 for strikes, and the gambit bounties you can do in non gambit activities accounts for 5. 4 if you dont like pvp. Then theres 3 from Banshee, and a bunch from eververse, Eva, etc. Out of all the requirements this was the least troublesome.
---
how?
---
Do you know why hunters don't
---
1 best manoeuvrability
---
2 throwing knife
---
3 easiest to use
---
Should've worked like Papa Calus there. Every character done gets a discount.
---
Wait till they finish invade then kill last envoy and do dmg. after 17 invades you could probably have tickled the primeval to death.
---
He reached 2100
---
No you can‚Äôt refund stuff.
---
You can still get the crucible pinnacle weapons and (presumably) the vanguard ones as well but obviously not gambit ones as this is part of forsaken. 
---
Gambit will be free to all players in October tho so you should be able to get them as well then
---
Yea if they gave us a few options then we could change it whenever we want. We need more small changes!
---
One exotic weapon and one exotic piece of armor
---
One exotic armor piece, one exotic gun
---
Hello warlock here
---
Hunters 
---
Easiest to use
---
Best jump 
---
Good exotics plural
---
Celestial Goldie highest DPS super
---
One two punch
---
Good roaming supers
---
BB best panic super
---
6 shot Goldie best ranged super
---
Invis
---
Dodge that reloads
---
Dodge that dodges
---
Throwing knifes
---
Titans
---
OEM
---
Striker which is the same as novawarp and spectral all three have been op
---
Shoulder charge easily shut down by shotguns/TLW/sidearms/fusions
---
Alternatively, J√∂tuun is a good all around option for both PvE and PvP.
---
I typically use Spiteful Fang and J√∂tuun together and safe my special ammo for a beefy target/blocker.
---
It will one shot a Golden Gun too.
---
Okay thanks
---
You can have one exotic weapon and one exotic armour at the same time
---
Warlock main?
---
It told me I had 7 days to refund
---
Elevenses please
---
Surveymonkey or Google are probably the top two picks.
---
You don't have to tho most people Main one character and barely play the others just at the end of a season to level them up lost likely people will get their main done then just not do solstice
---
Go play!
---
Ahah there‚Äôs certainly been some hours of sleep sacrificed, at least we have like 3 weeks left
---
You have to open a certain chest. It tells you which forge Boss to kill
---
L0l 200 iq
---
And will be entirely free when new light comes around.
---
Moon
---
Not to burst your bubble but you were using the most op super and gun in the game. It was impressive but easily done. Erentil and striker are broken
---
The problem with OEM to me is basically that it‚Äôs a tracking exotic with extra perks. Titan‚Äôs not the only class with tracking. Warlocks get Sanguine Alchemy, Hunters get Foetracer, even the entire Spectral tree.
---
OEM *is* the only exotic out of those that has buffs on top of the tracking. I think it should have one small buff, not all three. Because without any added buff, it‚Äôs tracking on one person every 10-15 seconds, that requires you to get hurt to activate. But give it maybe a little instant health regen on kill, cool, now we‚Äôre talking.
---
Iirc forsaken complete edition does come with the base game and dlc1&amp;2 (curse of osiris and warmind)
---
Haunted
---
So the one that came free with ps+ a while ago does have dlc 1 and 2?
---
Yeah, that's mentioned in the reply I was replying to.
---
Or is that just the bundle?
---
how many bounties can you hold at a time?
---
Dont think so. Either way if you look up the Forksaken set you want to get itll show you what it contains
---
Ok, thank you
---
Hmph interesting, had no idea, I don't use reddit that much. Just thought it would be a good way to get botters actually banned, but I guess people who want a bot free game are the ones who get banned. My apologies and i'll remove this.
---
**Now this is an Avengers level threat**
---
Lemme introduce you to the magic of Sanguine Alchemy. Could it use a buff? Probably. But it basically gives you tracking on all enemies in a radius
---
No worries, I knew that going in I was rocking them, mainly because I‚Äôm not really good at pvp, So this is me trying to compensate.
---
Noted brother
---
Bungie should add an extra 1/2 percent per run, more if its flawless towards the 1k drop. That's kind of ridiculous if you ask a logically thinking human being.
---
Love that you included your super and that knight kill.
---
Doesn't matter if you're using the weapon or not. The catalyst will drop for all the exotics you've acquired up to this point at random. Having done the math over two months of play, the drop chance is approximately 1%. So out of 100 strikes played you'll get one catalyst. It's been said that higher scoring Nightfalls has a better chance for a catalyst drop, but since there's a significant increase of difficulty involved (not to mention you can't really matchmake for it) regular strikes are still better in my opinion. 
---
Just do the strikes quickly as you can and it'll drop eventually.
---
My bad I don't use reddit that often. Just wanted botters banned. Last time I use reddit holy crap.
---
Yeah i was thinking about it. But i think the biggest problem for most people is they get impatient and ive come to understand the time it will take. Its a slow grind for the most part
---
Always happy to see another fan of Egyptian mythology.
---
It's completely random, they drop out of the chest as an exotic triangle, not engram. There is no manipulation of rng. I have all of the strike catalysts now, after having done a few hundred strikes.
---
They drop more often from Nightfalls, just a tip. So get a buddy and go farm an easy one. This week *The Arms Dealer* is a pretty quick one.
---
1 super and a heavy round with no orbs of light and tweaks to fusion rifles. I‚Äôd much rather be shotgunned than fusion‚Äôd
---
But you don't have to lose your humanity. You still have three weeks to do it.
---
Yeah, well I kinda already got majestic on all 3 so there‚Äôs no going back.
---
The reason I suggested using the weapon was because as I used crimson I got the catalyst(actually i don‚Äôt remember how I got it and I forgot if it comes from it) and thanks, does the medallion help at all for it?
---
Ill make a whole new threadüíô I‚Äôm now done raging
---
Pve or pvp

---
Hey Don't Talk About Gambit.
---
Yeah I will after I get my warlock the solstice gear, I‚Äôll run a nightfall with buffs and I‚Äôve been grinding the past 60+ hours to get my hunter and titan full solstice, do you know how much of an increase nightfalls give? 0.2+?
---
I recognize the CoS raid helmet and chest armor.
---
CoS Raid armor + Iron Banner cloak with season 3 ornament.
---
Those are the blade barrage mains, we do not include them in our gatherings.
