Can I keep it
---
---
---
Thanks man
---
I forgot to say I got ps4
---
Is that fucking buzz lightyear?
---
One time I won because no one was even on the other team in the first place.
---
I'm not saying you're wrong cause yeah a big portion of the community is women, but twitch isn't really an accurate representation of that. The average woman just tends to have more success with streaming than the average man, which is why you'd see more of them up top
---
It's from the new raid bro I have the full set and love it. If you're on ps4 I don't mind helping you out
---
He needs hells is all
---
I don't k ow how it would be coded, but I'm sure they could do it. It can't be impossible or take too long and would make both pvpers and pve players happy.
---
Where are the tethers
---
I hit fabled in like 2-3 hours (I lost a lot so you can probably do it way faster), then the wins took about 2 days of casual play. You should get it no problem :)

I fucking love that thumbnail
---
EDZ - Yeah we've got space and other planets and stuff but I really love the design.
---

---
Chaperone - I never liked shotguns, neither on I've nor on PvP and I never actually used any special weapon on PvP because I didn't find any of them interesting. That SG though just feels natural.
---
Eliksni - Makes me wonder of we as humans would end up like them if they traveller decided to leave us.
---
Thanks!
---
Depends on mode. Control would be tether, clash or similar modes would be middle arc or spectral. I was blade barrage main but it's been whiffing too much lately.
---
I have tried restarting the game, but no matter what I do, pressing E doesn't do anything.
---
Love Scathelocke, it was my first fave weapon till i got Horror Story.
---
To be fair, you're likely to get some disapproving glances for Stadia even here.
---
Same for me brother I just gave up
---
Hive seen worse before, but not much worse.
---
dont get mad. Most of the ppl who use those are easy enough to beat with a little bit of team coordination.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Yes, even the warlocks.
---
Got the day off tomorrow hopefully I’ll have it done before dinner hahaha
---
Solid idea. Better than what I think needs to happen
---
You should definitely stop shoulder charging in pvp ;)
---
Hahahah ok thanks for the info appreciate it !
---
Dude, I ate my own rocket off the back of my teammate's head AFTER warning them that I was gonna rocket the boss...
---
as do I
---
Hahaha 😉
---
I mean my clan is Thralling in my skin
---
I usually drop mine off to the side somewhere, that way everyone sees it go down but it's also not gonna cause any rocket or grenade incidents.
---
Why what do you think should happen? (Should I be scared to ask lmao)
---
Ah yes, because wormhusk, arc battery, and bottom tree arcstrider don't literally give you a mistake fixer.
---
Yes but honestly it ain’t bad
---
I have all the wins just have to hit fabled rank. I grinder the hell out of Iron banner this week to get that part done
---
Run strikes or nightfalls and just equip whatever that’s higher light level regardless of it being good or not, that’s how I got myself to 950 in a day
---
This that on a chromebook? If so oh my
---
Am I a bad man if I use a fusion, but it's an Epicurean?
---
Haha. It sure is.
---
This is the way
---
No disapproving glances here. Stadia is great for mobile gaming!

I seriously hope that Pulled Pork does him some good, personality-wise. I know he was insane at the end there, but he was also pretty hostile toward The Guardian even before Riven drove him mad...

RIP

If it's one of your passions, it'll stay with you. I'm 46, and an avid player. Don't have the time I had when I was younger, but I still play daily. Last weekend my youngest (16) and I duoed the Chasm of Screams for the Thorn, and I enjoy giving him shit about the fact I have the Recluse and he doesn't.

My ex-wife's stepfather is pushing 70 and may be the most competitive gamer I've ever seen, with a PC setup to die for and thousands of hours logged in PvP and racing games.

So the gamer never leaves, unless your interests change.

Can we get an F boys ....

I  tried to read the Oryx bio on destiny wiki and ended up reading *every* piece of hive lore on the site
---
\*robotic uwu\*
---
That's impressive and thanks for the tip
---
Okay. I was checking the lootpools the other day and noticed it too but wasnt sure how good the gun would be. But hey since I they decided that I do want unlock the other 2 BA exotics this is a perfect opportunity to get some valuable stuff from there as well.
---
This is so wholesome, I love that.
---
Probably. I think survival is too easy for some classes (ie striker Titans), especially when you get exotics in the mix. My idea is eliminate supers, special abilities like invisibility dodge or handheld super nova, and exotics. Wins would be purely based on skill and teamwork, at least how I imagine it.
---
horror story always felt kinda underwhelming tbh, similar to the werewolf.
---
What's your username mines TB-_-Kermit
---
Zero Hour (even the Heroic version) is 750, so anything above 770 is fair game (the game limits your light to requirement+20 if you are above that to keep things challenging)
---
That’s some 1,000,000 IQ playing right there. Take notes
---
Well when you remove abilities etc, you take a big part of destiny away, the game not a purely based PvP game, I agree with some classes have more strong points than others but I’m just talking about the Gamemode itself
---
I'm doing the same quest, but I'm taking a break until next season starts. I don't want to put in all the work and then my rank gets reset. 
---
Some useful tips here: [https://www.niris.tv/blog/gambit-lessons](https://www.niris.tv/blog/gambit-lessons) 
---
\*Get some Gamebit armor pieces, it helps. Get the weekly quest from the Drifter to upgrade your  Mote Synthesizer so you can get higher tier armor in Gambit Reckoning.  (do quest twice/2 weeks, to get to tier 3). You have to deposit a mote in Reckoning to get an armor piece of that type. 
---
[https://i.imgur.com/VBTKNWP.png](https://i.imgur.com/VBTKNWP.png) | I use 3 pieces of tier 2 reaper for the 6 points bonus
---
\*Check Ada (Black Armory) weekly quests for Gambit/Gambit Prime, these quests give really good rolls on the weapon. Gambit quests will give weapons that drop from Gambit. If you don't see it, click where it says "I II" for page 2 quests. 
---
\*Spare Rations is an excellent hand cannon from Tier 2/Tier 3 Reckoning. Could help you do your Ace of Spades quest if you don't already have a good hand cannon. (You don't need to deposit a mote to farm for Weapon drops)
---
Easy way to farm upvotes(you are not wrong tho :D) . +1
---
Seriously, though, the lore for this is a riveting story. You won't regret it if you read the Books of Sorrow or watch Byf's video. Insane epic novel.
---
I got it rather fast, getting decent roll Apostate..is a whole another story.
---
Hi, i have a newly created clan, newbie friendly, most of the people in there speak spanish but some speak english too (myself included)

---
Well I guess it's not just a PC issue then
---
What console do you play on
---
Yea, it might just be me. But when a mode is labeled competitive and all a player has to do is charge around a corner with (insert ability or super), it doesn't seem very competitive to me and doesn't promote team work. Understandably, that's part of destiny gameplay, but doesn't mean it has to be in comp.
---
Better than me homie, I play on ps4 and use an xbone controller on pc
---
🤣😂🤣😂
---
As someone who doesn't like PvP, I just like skullfort for letting me smash all the things when I get bored of being the babysitter bubble titan for my fireteam.
---
It’s not called competitive anymore, and I agree there needs to be some changes but with a game like destiny with the crazy amount of ability/weapon combinations the game will never ever be balanced there will always be one strong thing after another. Even with the best pvp dev team in the world it wouldn’t be balanced
---
I understand that mountaintop recluse combo can be OP especially when enemies are stacked, but it is not too hard to deal with especially in comp mode. Recluse alone? piece of cake. mid to long-range you're gonna get shit on by hand cannon, pulse or sniper, short-range you're gonna get shit on by a shotty all day.  But what about mountaintop and it's ridiculous one-shot potential? 9/10 you jump, stay away from the ground or the wall, rush them with shotty, you're golden. Worse case you get a trade but that's the same with shotty vs shotty. It's really all about strategy.
---
I see. I just bought now, thanks to the discount.
---
That is ridiculous. I love it
---
Fucking blueberries can't dps forge boss
---
He’s just having a bad day as you can clearly see him slumping out of his shell.
---
Relatable. I'm glad PvE in this game is fairly solid as well because if not I would've comitted sudoku after some long PvP gun farms. I'm still mostly a PvP main but the overall package of the game is good. I kinda wish all content were as good as Forsaken's though... I really enjoyed the main campaign.
---
Keeping it is up to you if you like it. I tend to keep stuff I don’t need as ascension material if their level is high enough though.
---
No, I got it pretty quick. Although it changed and is supposed to drop from any fallen supposedly, everyone I know got theirs the same way I did. And I don't think you can delete it... if I remember correctly it becomes a quest step once you pick it up.
---
It's ok I'm pvp if you get the catalyst, but great for  most pve stuff, especially thrall swarms
---
No I do understand. I just want shadowkeep because I already have the base game. Again I'm just being difficult because it includes base game so I was curious if there was a way to just add shadowkeep, possibly cheaper and less hardrive space.
---
I cant use mountaintop at all. Im trash with it lol. I use recluse as my close range weapon when i get pushed as i normally snipe
---
Medals I have, that was easy, the hard part is the 100% scout rifle final kills
---
Ah, a fellow man of culture. I have a few quintuple kills with this exact move this season, and numerous triples and quads. This map, gambler's ruin, and convergence are amazing maps for a quick multikill to start the game in control.
---
I’ve had a lot of fun in strikes and the Pit using Mountaintop, Fighting Lion and Swarm of the raven. I’m running Void class gear with increased grenade reserves, dexterity, enhanced reload, scavenger and oppressive darkness. Spec’d into discipline as well.
---
This is the veil.........
---
Thanks
---
Thanks I’ll let you know if I manage to get my stolen black armory gear. I’ll try to farm for it this weekend after the reset.
---
No, no, no. You sit there and draw your favorite loadouts in the margin of your notebook like the rest of us did in the 00’s. 
---
“What are you drawing weapons from Halo on your worksheets?”
---
“Just trying to make your class more interesting.”
---
Yeah, Erentil can do that in normal crucible.
---
Buy it separate. It's on sale for 40 percent off. I'd recommend the deluxe edition though to get the rest of the season passes.
---
Honestly for a second I thought the Titan was just going to slam the Knight with the wish ender.
---
Which I would thoroughly approve of.
---
no, just do riven cheese 3x and then 1x queenswalk if you're only interested in farming for 1kv. just lfg a group before you go
---
I work, I’m 968 max. Paying special attention to bounties can make a HUGE difference in raising the artifact light bonus.
---
How do you do that? The trick, I mean
---
PvE wise getting more kills in strikes and whatnot will come with time and knowledge of the strike (you end up playing a lot of strikes). Also, better gear like pinnacle weapons from quests you pick up from vendors can assist in the slaying capabilities. General knowledge of the game is essentially what it boils down to, not just playing on mouse and keyboard. Just keep playing and learning from other guardians and you'll have the 250 kills per strike down in no time.
---
Fully Auto Nova bombs? Slow down there, Satan!

which PvP gun we talkin?

Like the previous, I dont know you or where you're from but you're life is indeed precious and it isn't worth it. I get that life is hard and it sucks. It really can be tough. But think of this, guardian, how many times were you defeated by Crota? Or Atheon? And you still beat them! Life is a raid, keep trying and going at it, and your light will prevail.
---
Ghost: So you just forgot how to blink? 
---
Hunter: Yeah I guess but I have a cool pointy stick now.
---
I dont blame you for feeling weird about the men fetishizing lady gamers in the comments, but OP just struck me as wanting to make a public declaration to/about his wife.
---
cayde wanted to die... being immortal isn't fun if you are rarely ever allowed to go on adventures... you are just sitting on your ass watching other people have fun while you are stuck training some wannabe badasses in the art of stabbing you enemies and running away
---
&gt; Shaxx nerds out @ his monitors from the crucible...

but it doesn't stop him to scream the fuck out every kill someone pulls in there... and we love it for that.

Heyo! I played D1 a lot and i'm trying to get back into to D2 after not playing since reaching the max light level of 305 back at the beginning of the game. I've just finished the forsaken and shadowkeep campaigns and i'm now at light 902 and i'm completely lost and overwhelmed with 40 quests in my inventory. Ill take any help given but my main questions are, is it even possible to get into the game right now with how deep the game has gotten? And if it is, should I keep the character ive been playing as or should I completely restart with a new character? Thanks for the help in advance!
---
Agreed wholeheartedly!
---
Looks cute
---
I still haven't done a raid yet.

I won’t downvote you for having a preference in someone’s tone of voice and/or how they speak. It is your opinion, your simply sharing that. Respect.
---
&gt; but uldren always wanted to kill cayde for that time cayde supposedly fucked mara sov 
---
Aight imma need a source for this one because that's a pretty big claim, and the fact he couldn't even look at Cayde when he shot him makes a more convincing argument that he didn't want to kill him imo.
---
...Seriously though I'm not looking for an argument I just wanna know if there's a source for that.
---
That’s literally pretentious, though. Still love his videos because I’m too lazy to read lore.
---
Yessir
---
ill make sure he will remember from this shoulder to his face it will be engraved.

No, PS4 Remote Play is a trainwreck. Stadia actually works... I enjoy the casual stroll in RDR2 on my phone on the go. Yes it doesn't replace my wonderful PC, but being able to play AAA titles on devices that could never handle it is great. But keep listening to everyone who doesn't even have it or tries to compare it to $400 consoles and $1k PCs. It's $129 and does exactly what is expected of a streaming service.
---
His wife was imaginary so yeah I'd imagine that'd be pretty hard to beat lol
---
Please don't do it don't man its not worth it. But if you truly do commit die just letting you know you will be remembered guardian
---
Not sure if you were just exaggerating for effect, but you do lose Glory.  I lost 40-52 Glory each loss.  You do get protection against dropping ranks.
---
The internet you won.
---
oh okay i guess I'm wrong then.
---
I got about 120, maybe 140. Best one, which is one that ill currently holding at, is spike grenades, genesis, full court and velocity.

i cant believe this

Everyone wants games to die once they're at the top, minecraft was the same shit when it first blew up, now its praised asf rn.

Love you Prismo

Jesus, rng really shits on some people

Lmao bud there's about 7 pvp modes if you wanna be bad and waste people's time go shoot people with rocket launchers leave pvp opinions to the pros
---
I didn't even know that was a thing I'm just tired of loading into games and people immediately leaving or just sitting there afk and it actually matters in control it's not like clash like who cares if you AFK or leave in clash
---
Yeah im that some people. Im dying HELP mE
---
Lmao okay big guy. Complain on reddit some more bc I’m sure cammy, drewsky, and all your other “pro” compadres will think you’re cool. What’s your destiny tracker?
---
yes! my favorite shader of late, i shine brilliant as the sun
---
PvE because PvP meta is busted right now. Glad I just got recluse and mountaintop and got out.

Whatever dude I wipe my ass with neckbeards like you go REEEEEE on someone else's post

Nice .96 lol. Sausagegrip. Come back when you’re above 1.0 my guy

Skin tight for females?

Whats your method of farming gl kills btw?

I read every single book in Skyrim and learned the dragon script so learning the Destiny lore was a cake walk for me
---
On a melee Titan gg nub KD doesn't matter
---
Are you having a stroke, bro?
---
Don’t give up
---
Idk man im not pushing any viewpoints on anyone. I use snipers and slug shottys mostly. If i use mountain top then ill be going for body shots. My aim will get bad and ill start losing more games. I dont care about what other people think about other guns. Im speaking simply of how i am as a player. I know my weaknesses. I need to consistantly play with what im good at or ill get clapped. I dont judge what people use. And in quick play i use trace rifles bows and sweet business lol
---
Oh no
---
[removed]
---
cringe
---
I believe this last week gets bonus infamy in Gambit so might not be a bad time to reset your rank
---
Forsaken is recommended tbh. Play red war first, then forsaken (if you get it). I would give some backstory for it now, but I feel it would ruin the first mission a bit and some of the pivotal points in the campaign. After you play forsaken, mynameisbyf clears up a lot of the questions, so watch that to try and satisfy any questions perhaps
---
Don’t use google use Byf
---
Correct.  Only survival or survival: freelance
---
He clearly had the new razer socks on.
---
Rip getting that weapon then Im good on a team but 3 v 3.. fabled going to be hard.
---
I find playing aggressively against GLS is fairly successful because it makes it harder to track the bounces. If they're using mountaintop just stay in the air and shoot them with your own mountaintop
---
The hydras have nothing to do with it.  It’s RNG.  I had to do seven rounds in order to get the damn overlord to spawn at one of the places and that was just one of the days I tried.
---
Ah yes but it's hardly funny, just becuase you think that it is and I don't doesnt make me wrong so go eat shit
---
I mean if you read my post when using MT you're not even going for body shots most of the time. That's an awful lot of projection about your aim getting bad just by using a GL. But hey you play your game, doesn't bother me.
---
Wait a second, was I there for that session of Altars?
---
It firems blank but somehow the wielder is rolling like it hurts
---
&gt; shoot them with your own mountaintop
---
...that doesn’t help the problem at all
---
Hey I may not fully wrap my head around the lore sometimes but that don’t mean I don’t enjoy it! XD it’s like that bulk box of crayons some of the flavors seem absolutely obnoxious but I can still appreciate the art they make a couple hours later.
---
The type of people who want everyone (including children apparently) to have guns aren't going to be big on any kind of safety. Especially gun safety.
---
Ya but if he’s selling for 45$ they r probably too worked to do shit
---
I have never seen that attack animation
---
I bet this is a bug that he/she is using to get mountaintop. Hope they fixs it
---
Are you implying that you know how i am as a player better then me? What lol. Im telling you my aim gets worse when i use projectile weapons for a while and then swotch back to hit scan. Its not an unhead of concept. I dont know whats "projecting" about that. How does one "project" onto themselves?
---
Nice, but I hope you don't mind this. IMO the ghost is too close
---
I'm confused what is this?
---
ur jooking right??? Gonna try it out now
---
Not true my nephew learned gun safety at an early age, not all gun enthusiasts are total asswipes they just usually pick folks that make there point when it comes to the media  ie unsafe morons
---
Just because the meme isn’t funny doesn’t mean you have to be a bitch about it. If you make a joke that people don’t laugh at, do they insult you about it? No, they don’t, so just be a normal, polite human being and scroll past the meme.
---
For real
---
Lmao, me with thunderlord and well taking out the ads so my new light friends can focus the boss.
---
Whatever that effect was you were using during snipe was awful.
---
Holy shit I was.
---
Damn this is so good
---
Ha. I've just been trying to give you a couple tips for MT and maybe hint at trying it out a bit more when you seem so adamant about sucking with it. No need to take things so personally.
---
Recluse Izanagi KWTD kick on wipe.
---
Tractor Cannon is an amazing use of heavy, provided you utilize its super-cancelling powers, and/or not just like a regular shotgun otherwise
---
This season has been the easiest season to get Fabled by far. Wins get you like 200 glory and you barely lose any for losses.  Also, by just PLAYING 3 survival a week you get about 200 bonus glory at reset.  For example I got Fabled this season with 8 wins, 12 losses, and a 0.86K/D.  Definitely not my best performance
---
 Here's some tips:
---
-Play in the freelance playlist, no teams can join so you'll never gave a really good fireteam of 3.  Maybe 3 really good randoms though.
---
-Follow your teammates around and just help assist them.  Then you won't go out dying alone.
---
This one was printed on an Up! Mini but I also own an Up! Box, Up! plus, CR 10s and an Ultimaker.
---
Could you modify this to shoot nerf bullets?
---
This would happen to me when I used to play Dark Souls 2. I would go back to playing Dark Souls 3 or Bloodborne and the game would look super fuckin choppy and ugly until my eyes readjusted to 30 FPS. The way I look at it is if you really enjoy the game, the fps doesn't really matter. Within reason of course. Can't be playing something lower than 30.
---
Now this I can truly appreciate. Most of the 3d prints I see are just printed and painted as is. They're still really cool, but I feel to make a proper one it should be sanded.
---
This is my favorite post on this sub.
---
I want this now but as I don’t have 3D printer cannot now sad
---
How does one delete a skill tree?
---
Thanks man, I do get what you mean, most just have acrylics slapped on fresh of the printer and that’s just a waste of a print if you ask me, I personally still think I could’ve done a better job sanding but all in all I’m content with how it’s turned out.
---
This is the way.
---
Fuck fusion rifles
---
I’d imagine there would be some way to do it, I’m not to sure how. I’ll make that my next project though!
---
Sure is only fair
---
Fuck the Vanguard, Adorable Calus Cat is my leader now
---
Same here, brother, same here
---
the silver is a really nice touch
---
Well if you figured out how to make the functional part of the nerf gun quite small you could build the rest of the gun around it.
---
OK BOOMER
---
Bro what is it with these 3D printed Destiny guns lately? First I see Ace, then Sunshot, now Whisper of the Worm??
---
I gotta get me a 3D printer Jesus Christ...
---
Looks absolutely amazing by the way man holy crap, these 3D printed destiny guns are both simultaneously screaming and whispering “*hold me*”. I’m attracted like a moth to a flame.
---
I thought that when you said dollars you meant usd. Sorry.
---
bro 😎💪
---
Saint 14 is technically dead. But apparently we give past Saint 14 the fittingly named shotgun 'Perfect Paradox', which we got off the dead body of present day Saint 14. This loop of events makes zero sense, hence 'Perfect Paradox'.

In short; Yes and no. Vex are confusing. Time travel, bring a sword.

holy shit its gorgeous gj !!!

I'd say arcstaff for 3v3, but as a whole I think spectral blades is still the best subclass.
---
I dont mean to be antagonistic but yall are making it too complicated. Just run hand cannon sniper and you're golden
---
I guess I'm the orca whale.  Titan main still only 964 light. Pitiful, right?
---
Also it says near the top of the email that an email with the codes will be sent after 24 hours, it has been 72 hours
---
It doesnt come close to what it should do as a streaming service. It’s actual garbage and have experienced it for myself.
---
You do realise there are better alternatives for stadia right? Like the one from geforce. It might not be perfect but its waaaaaaay better than stadia and its only in beta.
---
The launch of stadia has been a complete shitshow and I love it.
---
wow, just wow
---
The Hive have a method, but it's pretty extreme. Only saw it the one time. Watched a Wizard rip the light out of my best friend and funnel it into some kind of crystal.
---
Never believe leaks. There’s no such thing as a reliable Destiny leak. 
---
The one guy that gets credit for like 2 correct “leaks” only does so because people ignore the hundreds that were nonsense.

And if you’re spinfoiling, put “Theory” or “Spinfoil” or something in your title so people don’t think this is a legit spoiler.

I've been trying to get the first encounter raid bow so I can run this loadout that synergize with my 10 second dodge recharge
---
Psst...stacked teams are teams that are playing the game correctly.
---
thanks for the input
---
Nice
---
i would have taken you up on this but unfortunately im not cool enough for PC GAMING im a ps4 bandit but thanks anyways
---
That ghost chell hand it over
---
Matchmaking didn’t do that to you. The coward crybaby that left the match early did that to you. 
---
But it is partially your fault. Because you solo-queued into a team co-op activity. When you do that you’re rolling the dice on so much. And you made that choice. You’re gambling your teammates will be experienced and play objectives, you’re gambling you don’t backfill into an abandoned slot, and mostly you’re gambling that you’re going to have the experience *you want* instead of the many experiences you *know* are likely. 
---
Solo queuing means you opted into this possibility. So don’t complain when it happens.
---
Best thing you can do is contact that support email they've given you in that email
---
lol everybody is like 
---
''Thats not true !!!"
---
Hell yeah!
---
I usually don't care for these types of things, but I am beyond impressed with this. Looks absolutely amazing, incredibly well done.
---
Sounds good and I made another post with a different picture but idk if it will help
---
Ya'll realize Variks caused the prison break that lead to Cayde's death.  
---
Although unintentionally, he stilled played a part.  
---
Now he's gone and become Kell of Kells.
---
Sadly no. Just survival playlist.
---
I laughed but seriously how is it ok that bungie has YET to tell the whole story  with the game play. Like....isn't that the fucking point....
---
Maybe bungie should watch it.
---
OP forgetting the part where your medals will not count sometimes. It was a pain in the ass to complete.
---
The title/seal is seasonal, that has to be completed by end of next game-week if you want Undying. 
---
Randy’s is never going away. You can get it anytime, forever. This guide is for Guardians on a time crunch that want the title.
---
Murder my main man Cayde? Hahaha. Funny warlock...but no.
---
Jeepers, it seems like there is a ton of lore but nothing much in the game. Or?
---
You didn't know? Yeah. They made it just reload for you instead of reload with imaginary bullets.
---
OP forgetting Momentum Control is gone lul
---
Do you know de way?
---
Forgot nothing. Because that’s not an actual bug - people just expect all medals to count, or *some* medals, or heard some bad advice, when that’s not how the quest works. After a point, only weapon multikill medals count. And of those, Sub Machinist is by far the easiest to get. 
---
Nobody was ever actually bugged: they just didn’t understand the quest. Which isn’t entirely their fault, it’s not described correctly - but it was never actually broken, that’s just an assumption that was repeated so much it was often mistaken as fact.
---
You forgot it comes back in 8 hours lol. 
---
Read TWABs, pay attention to details, stop talking about things you haven’t bothered to understand.
---
Yeah you're pretty serious about it clearly. Figure out a way to counter it like everyone else.
---
Clash for EVERYONE ELSE . MWEAHAHAH
---
I really like it!  But in my opinion, it's up to you :)
---
It was supposed to be humorous yet still pointing out at the problem, and people shouldn't be forced to play certains way because someone is using something that is broken. Isn't Crucible supposed to be all about fun?
---
Thankfully ppl using this weapon can't aim anyway. Sorry still salty, just seeing recluse over and over again. Like there's other weapons in the game wtf why use the same thing eberyone does
---
Which is 50/50 for those who have it lol.
---
I've been on so many 1:1s with that thing and shit is just spraying around haha
---
How is there no gun (for you)  did you just crop it out?
---
COOL
---
Huzzah! You are the first to notice, I was going to print some but why bother when you can build one yourself?
---
i dont think they r fake... i mean... he has flashbacks of them b4 every death
---
Nope spawn swap weapon when holdin 2 smgs
---
Materials wise about $80 Aud but with man hours and time taken I don’t even know. It’s not for sale though and is props a one off.
---
Just saying. That's my answer to it. Someone else already out forth erentil. Taking the duel solo to avoid the risk of healing/overshield from a kill is also a tactic I employ. I've seen people (probably accidentally) trade off who shot the Titan last to avoid the vengeance proccing on a kill. Unsure if that's actually how it works, but it seems too. Could possibly be done intentionally with a buddy and some discipline.
---
Heavy ammo also just generally works, and most shotguns will be enough to finish the fight before it's a problem.
---
Don't rush the Titan when they have overshield (still waiting for that to go away- thought it was supposed to vanish while I was on vacation, but alas).
---
Basically you've gotta take the fight smarter, not harder, be it weapon choice or tactics. If you can't or won't (from a skill mismatch or playstyle reason, or other), just avoid them and farm the rest of the team. If it's Survival... Gonna have to deal.
---
There's so much stuff that can be labeled as OP for crucible. It's not all equally manageable, but regardless you need to deal with it or don't.
---
Gonna have to fight cheese with cheese, or else do a dark souls and "git gud," whatever that might mean at the time.
---
I think it could use jut the tiniest amount of detailing towards the end of the barrel, maybe some more white dots to make it look “taken” near the scope like in the game, but that’s just me. Looks like you put a lot of effort into this and it’s already cool enough as is, so do how you like but 10/10 awesome print
---
Yea lmao the one shot clutch called no skill
---
I want him but he's pretty exprensive!  Whered you buy him from
---
Dude that’s beautiful, what sort of methods did you sue and which model?
---
I made the model myself and it’s not for sale.
---
He's talking about HIS worm, not whisper
---
Yeah, sorry
---
I love crucible. I just choose not to bitch about other people and what they use. You're going to die, it's PvP. I find some folks need excuses for why they're not good at crucible so they cling onto something lol Ke OeM and run with it. Doing so makes it sound like that's all you die to. Let's be real, you're not as good at PvP as you think.
---
Basically yeah man, I’m aiming to grind for it sometime next week but we’ll see. When in doubt, just bloody make it yourself, screw the grind!
---
I don’t want it removed because it’s asinine to have to remove ANYTHING because of constant balancing.
---
With that being said it’s the one thing that is a constant complaint, and offers Titans the same thing built into Warlock and Hunter subclasses.
---
I can see eliminating the tracking, but otherwise it’s an Eternal Warrior Helm on steroids. And it’s a helm that is niche to PVP, where the playing field is already complicated, being that mass-wiping appeal from Warlock and Hunter supers are king; now that Titans have an option that is lynchpin to an exotic folks have been raging.
---
Ask Bungie to balance Titan Super damage in PVP to make them even with their counterparts, and then maybe OEM won’t be such a beast against you.
---
You know. I always hated it too. Then I needed solar kills for Lunas and my Trust wasnt cutting it. If I started earlier in the season I would've just trucked through it with Trust. But I didn't, and I resorted to Jotunn. I knocked out my solar kills in an evening with it. Finished the rumbles last night and knocked out 20 headshots with handcannons. Jotunn is back in my vault now, never to be used again in crucible. Felt awful doing it, but I needed those solar kills quickly.
---
Sorry to everyone, had to get that quest done and jotunn worked beautifully for it.
---
But here’s the secret: I don’t notice when I even have the effect, much less do I notice the increase in damage or shield, I just accept that I’m not the best player in the world. Ignorance is bliss, my friend
---
I did the same thing. That 4 hour video...watched it over the course of a week. Def helped immerse me more into what I was doing after I knew what was up. I'm new to the whole destiny thing (started after Shadowkeep) So I didn't have a clue what was going on.
---
Cute as f but stop stealing her kills jessie
---
I'm missing something here.
---
What is so special about the Unstoppable Ogre?
---
Cool shit
---
Oof
---
What?
---
I’m tired of getting one punched coming around a corner!
---
I think it's because the Google stadia controller has to connect to your phone via the destiny servers.
---
Which TWAB
---
Yeah it is weird as I consider it to not be very recognizable.
---
Whos a good robotic lord you are yes you are
---
Wait you got a wife
---
Yes lmfao thats the whole point of streaming
---
Why should I rely souly on mods that are gone at the end of the season? Mods can make it easier but if you rely on them alone, you will have a hard time in a few days.
---
Got it, cheers dude!
---
i love this. and it's perfectly fine. they got what they asked for.
---
Still have insurmountable skullfort tho :)))
---
Never said it was dude, lol. I said **I** love it. 
---
I have plenty of success with it, I like the way it feels, and it works. Case closed.
---
Cool, well I have no issues with my Stadia so I continue to promote it. Does exactly what I was expecting. I own a lot of Google products though. I'm just not sure why there's so much hate for a product that's trying to make gaming easier and more affordable. To each there own, I guess.
---
&gt;I thot they were new  ultimates oppose to hunters golden gun but I'm not seeing them
---
Those will be the middle tree of each sub-class that is unlocked through PvE content.
---
Maybe they answer this today, in the reveal stream for the next season.
---
What are you trying to show here?
---
its a bug you just need to re log  
---
this is bungo quality
---
Using the striker super to cross the final jumping puzzle in vault of glass &lt;3 I miss it so much.
---
You do realise you have to pay full price for games that you have to buy again that dont run as well as on other streaming services that are free?
---
it’s going to be a **chonky** boi
---
[deleted]
---
I  thought this was an nsfw joke
---
if you log in to destiny tracker with steam dose that not work?
---
Yup, when i punched calus-bot to finish him in levithian
---
Cringe
---
How much RAM are we talking?  
---
Destiny 2 does utilize a lot of RAM, so do plenty of the newer games
---
r/unexpectedtf2
---
i wonder why the caval didn't choose to use their pods as an attack since it just have more precision than their snipers.
---
Oh.
---
OK.
---
When you beat all the raids calus is happy boi
---
Check Youtube for full guides.
---
Essentially , they are small platforming sections with a boss at the end. Killing the boss rewards loot. 
---
They can be accessed through a hidden portal that can only be seen while under the influence of a tincture of queensfoil. 
---
The location and the challenge itself is on a weekly rotation, with 6 different ones on repeat.
---
Why I switched too hunter tbh
---
Why am I seeing this meme format everywhere? Is this from something? I feel like in the only one that sees how cringe these are.
---
&gt; If we got collectors two big boys and 2 goblins
---
so you were the dickhead that stomped me last game with those big doods?
---
how about the vram? at one point it only used 0.9 GB
---
I used those shoulders forever! looks great!
---
You snapped
---
When you have an Android
---
Or maybe it's just an extremely effective way to save money on college?
---
I heard it's trash for the top players but I am top 1.7% in IronBanner on Destinytracker and I still feel it's a free kill machine and when being shot I just hope it misses me by my random movement.
---
Have you seen the Fallout Storyteller videos? How do you feel about that format?
---
*laughs in Titan*
---
IcyAzraelSnow I’ll be on maybe in 7hrs today

First reached 100 level then i about it! LOL

OMNIGUL.... she hunts for you...
---
Ep armor gang rise up
---
It's a great gun and is a good choice for most activities. Its primary weakness is that it's exotic and precludes you from equipping other exotics that may be better, like Izanagi's or Anarchy. This doesn't matter at all outside of pinnacle activities where performance is key, like raids, so use what you like best and don't worry about min-maxing unless the situation demands it
---
You guys live in 3019
---
Oh god, here comes ze watterfallz!
---
The 5 resets is not as bad as it sounds.  I think I've had 10 or 12 this season.
---
Agree to disagree? &lt;3
---
best 3d gun ive seen on this sub
---
Yeah fuck that. Not even trying for that gun
---
His penis got infected with the darkness and it's now slowly taking over his body.
---
I know they’re never going to do this, but I wish there was a bigger difference between armor sets for male and female guardians. Most of the time the armor is just scaled down a little for female guardians instead of actually being shaped differently.
---
Huh? 
---
Is this a private match? If so nothing done in private matches has any effect on Title/Triumph/Pursuit progression.
---
Then the goblins just make each other invincible instead.
---
Yeah that's entirely unfair. 100 crucible/vanguard or 50 gambit to get it (not even counting Vex Offensive, wtf is wrong with you Bungie?) and then 700 kills to actually activate it.
---
As a Titan main I salute you. *But next time go punch them all*
---
I mean, if you manage to get the god roll on it, it's definitely still a top tier pulse rifle, it just requires you to deliver precision kills consistently.
---
Yeah like 1000 People before you
---
love it
---
Thinking isn't exactly their strong suit.
---
Not true. I just got mine a few days ago.
---
No it’s not, that got patched like a month ago. I got mine like mid November.
---
It’s not really a game breaking bug. People always find ways to get out of the map. Probably not a high priority fix.
---
yes because if there were these many exotics with that much killing power for Titans we would see more variety and not just OEM
---
Mmm, a nice warm glass of soylent-brown; [100% people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UPDUpjkHg0). Drifter knows good eatin'.
---
My bad
---
I'm gonna be honest, I'm starting to get burned out from all the silly "Kill 5,000 enemies while they're sittin on the toilet, and I need another 2,000 Cabal kills in the Tree of Probabilities nightfall". It's not fun, and it doesn't feel satisfying to complete them.
---
I like actual quests...the ones where you actually have to go through an area, preferably one you never been to before. That's why Ace of Spades quest is so memorable to me, I've never been to that area before the quest, and I enjoyed taking my time exploring the area for Cayde's chests. I took my time doing that quest, because it was new and exciting, and ultimately fun.
---
The constant grinding for something like a catalyst is tedious and boring...I think I only have a handful of catalysts complete, and that's because I actually like the weapons.
---
Broadsword :wave:
---
OOF I feel bad for anyone who bought the season pas without shadowkeep, so little content
---
Move on with your life...yeah, you should. You suck as a "moderator"

Titans have been getting shit on for so long for just having something that works
---
Never saw a curated vex offensive gun
---
I lucked out and got the rare bounty for only having to do 6 max temper ignitions :D
---
they matched one step and then another step was bugged just not for all players
---
No problem. I played Menagerie until my eyes were bleeding when it first came out. Still use a ton of the gear.
---
If the third member of that fireteam was a Titan he was probably off eating crayons and punching rocks while yall performed that big brain play 🤣👏🏻 well done guardians.
---
I hit that in about 45 minutes using graviton in momentum, one hit precision kill if both shots land
---
Haha what a dumbass titan (laughs in hunter blade barrage no aim)
---
The enemy can’t kill you uf you have a real weapon. No literally a Whisper of the Worm
---
Noice! Thanks for taking the time.
---
if only i could have it in game i can’t complete the mission

DONT STEAL MY CHOCCY MILK, MA
---
I didn't post this because of the glaringly obviously cleavage, I posted it because of the suit design. If you are just starting at her chest you need to grow the fuck up.
---
Oh damn, I guess I didn’t encounter the issue then. Is there a reason it’s taking so long to the fix the quest for one of the most popular exotics in the game?
---
I love how you use simple legos to hold it up over some extravagant stand lol
---
If this were the unnerved striker days, I'd laugh and be happy. But now I just feel sorry for you.
---
Finally finished Jotunn and the bow quests. Was relieved and pleasantly surprised that there were no other steps involved.
---
A pyramid scheme where the guiding principle is that only the strong are meant to survive. It is the underlying hierarchy of the hive. Oryx and his sister's made a pact with worm God's ,where they get power for killing things (which pays tribute to the worms). They realized it was better to have other things kill for them and pay them tribute. Each level of the hierarchy of the hive kills things to get power and pay tribute to the next higher up creature.
---
Not only that, but killed two of OP's teammates just before they died, too. Wayyy too many grenades for a single heavy pack.
---
That's bungie's signature move.. going way overkill on the amount of things you need per quest... its brutal. If you dont have time to put in hours everyday it's not even possible to do. So annoying.
---
The warlock one is broken comparatively, maybe just damage
---
Hunter dodge does not reload melee ability. That's why you're getting downvoted, you said something blatantly wrong.
---
Ew
---
yeah, it can be used at a range, but the vow is 1000% better at that and can be accessed by anyone
---
Damn... Hunter players in this game are the equivalent of mage players in WoW, always whining and playing victims when they have no reasons to be with such a good kit....
---
If he said this in game on a losing streak that would be amazing
---
So instead of relying on random teammates to move you need to take the initiative and re-position yourself. I get its frustrating, but it will be the only fix for this.
---
Every class can do it. I did it recently with triple jump on my hunter, without any swords. It's tricky to do, just have patience.
---
https://youtu.be/8Eoz5Wl4lg4
---
"Rest easy failsafe. The Guardian has this." (That guardian not mine)
---
All three shoulder charges are near useless in a shotgun fusion meta. Anybody paying attention can’t be shoulder charged. Suppression shoulder charge blatantly doesn’t work 9 times out of 10 and it’s incredibly suicidal. Spectral is better than bottom tree striker in every way. 
---
Hunter evade is the only ability that can reload guns instantly so essentially every gun has double mag size. Hunter evade can also instantly recharge all melee energy, every hunter class has both of these abilities. Bubble is entirely defensive and should’ve always offered weapons as it was the most useless super until then. Every void subclass has that buff. 
---
I never said titans are underpowered my point is hunters are equal if not stronger if many scenarios but are first to play the victim while warlocks sit in the dust.
---
I asked two of my friends to "help me finish up this quest real quick"...
---
I'm sorry Peter. I'm sorry Ben. I did get Thorn though.
---
My friend and I did this too, he hit it with a Celestial Nighthawk shot when it was too low and murdered it
---
It happened?
---
Chocolate vex milk, my fav
---
Lion gang rise up, Jotunn is trash
---
Suicide
---
Redrix
---
You... I think you've killed me multiple times before
---
Could be wrong though. There's probably more than one someguy
---
You get middle tree for free now
---
Yes Fortnite Bad, we get it
---
Well yes but to do that first I'll need to aquire Forsaken
---
Damn but don’t that like kill you?
---
Well they did give gunslingers 6 shots with a returning shot as long as you don’t miss.
---
blade barrage is imo the best for shutting down opponent supers currently. I would say in solo play arc staff, but in team play barrage with the other 2 running a super to get multiple kills consistently.
---
To be fair as a warlock the trade off for handheld supernova is having a lackluster super for that subclass. Not saying its not overpowered but nova warp got nerfed pretty good and rightfully so. So at least we have a trade off for going that build route since its a suboptimal super for the only one shot ability we have. Plus no one can deny our melee still needs attention.
---
Plus I would love a mode where it was guns only, no abilities other than your jumps. It would be a good change or when you just want to show your skill with weapons and movements in the game.
---
If you're on Xbox it's very possible. I played a LOT of PvP this season. Enough to get 6 pinnacle weapons
---
My point wasn't that it's impossible to fight against they're just annoying to fight against, watching the kill feed to avoid players and avoiding tight spaces isn't something that should have to be done
---
I just dont see the point in building something for  a game in a different game
---
if you can hit headshots it'd be better to use the Luna's howl or the Service revolver. when I say something is bad, I mean it can be beaten by a mediocre handcannon while in its ideal engagement
---
See, there’s your problem. You somehow got insulted when I explained to you the fundamentals of the game. 
---
Yes, you have “the right” to solo queue. But you also know the things you’re complaining about are going to happen. How much sense does it make to complain about a result you knew to expect?
---
Stacks don’t match with stacks because the advantages of teamwork are a fundamental part of co-op gameplay. That’s the *right* way to do it. 
---
Also, everyone that plays the game takes issue with the idea that going vs a stack is an instant loss. Any 6 randoms can beat any stack - but again, if winning is your priority than you gotta hope you get randoms that are also trying to win. You might 4 people working on Randy’s and a newbie in green armor and a guy that just needs one bounty for whatever quest. And in times like those, yeah you’re gonna fail. But when you solo queue *you know that’s gonna happen*.
---
If you engage in risky behavior, grow up and own it. Don’t cry and whine and be insulted when it’s pointed out that you made the decision to do that.
---
Saint 14 is my hero
---
I'm not even gonna try and argue with that logic.
---
not sure what info youre looking for but to start you off
---
FOR STORY:
---
have you played foresaken and the base game? if you havent you can start with those. (im assuming you havent since you sound really lost haha)
---
if you have just go to the moon itll start a cut scene then everything follows from there (you can track shadowkeep in your quests after the cut scene)
---
PVP:
---
pvp feels bad when you dont like your gear so you might want to play a bit more before hoping in! find out what guns you like, etc
---
honestly i just looked for guns i liked then did the quests for em lol (highly recommend the Thorn if u like hand cannons) - also for exotics you might wanna check our xur so you can get some new shit
---
FRIENDS:
---
you can look for a clan so you have people to play with (also really helpful to join communities so you can do raids)
---
This is true, but I find that skill tree more effective against a large horde of enemies rather than a boss. I often run top tree for precision damage and celestial nighthawk for a quick chunk off a boss's HP.
---
Deal.
---
https://youtu.be/XoWHmw7vGiw new trailer ;)
---
That must be why I thought it felt really good to use. I consistently hit heads, it definitely didn't feel bad to me, but it  wasn't used long, I prefer to run a sniper on my second slot.
---
I disagree. Blindly rushing should not always be the strategy, avoiding players with a VERY temporary buff isn't a big deal either. I'm not talking the entire game, I'm talking literally 5 seconds. It really comes down to you and your awareness of the game around you. You're safe to push if they don't have the things designed to be strong against rushing players then you're alright to rush em.
---
I was playing survival and there was a oem titan who one hit meleed me and tea bagged and every round after that I kept head shotting him with a sniper and teabagging. That was the only time I've ever tea bagged in destiny
---
Are you being serious? Gamblers Dodge m8? 
---
&gt;Dodge to perform a deft tumble, avoiding enemy attacks.Dodging near an enemy recharges melee ability
---
Did you honestly not know about that?
---
You can't really see a shotgun or half charged fusion rifle or a lot of other things will 1 shot you. Recluse is abused, definitely. The rest really isn't that bad. Each class has their bullshit one shitting attacks, it's whatever
---
Hey man free randy multikills
---
Here, some choccy milk. Cause you ain't a snitch.
---
Lol I dont mind being pulled at all. I suuuuck at jumping. I don't understand. I have been using this character for awhile. But I just get panicked and cant land properly.
---
Oh yeah I guess rifts, 2 amazing pve supers, great online exotics, blink yeah none of that exists does it. I'm a warlock main don't try and bullshit me with that's all they have. I've done perfectly fine without using them my entire time playing.
---
GoS is worth running for pinnacle gear and to get Divinity. Once the season resets, the Anarchy is supposedly going to have the drop rate increased, so it would be worth running SotP if you don't have it. Outside that, the raids can drop specific mods that really help out in different content (minus the Leviathan specific mods). The raid armor has been dropping pretty high in stats as well from what I hear. Last Wish would be good to run regularly if you don't have 1k Voices and to get the taken mod.
---
Blame the long ass bounty for ability spam, that thing took forever.
---
The main reason why hunters are the majority is literally because the preview hunter looks way cooler than the other two. I've asked everyone I know, lfg raid groups, people in the tower, and so many new light players I can't even remember the close second. The fact is that due to pop culture, most people love the scoundrel/rogueish character. Warlocks and Titans don't really appeal to new players which explains the larger quantities of hunters compared to the other two.
---
TRANSMAT FIRING
---
What speed overshield exotics are you talking about m8?
---
That makes sense actually. Also probably why I dont get better at It.
---
Moon bounties. Preferable with a fireteam member to take advantage of the season pass xp boost.
---
How big is it? Mine is just about 5 and half feet long
---
Same.  I need 1 or 2 more heroic adventures before I can get my title.
---
Bounties are the most efficient. Preferably on all three characters.
---
It being possible is going to depend on how much time you have. Because you are going to need to live on the game.
---
None
---
Damn boi he thicc
---
Imagine thinking this has anything to do with getting good
---
Awesome, thank you.
---
Wasn't me it was a blueberry warlock up front
---
Imo I'd choose Suros Regime. Pair it with Actium War Rig if you're playing as a Titan. It'd give you a boost in offensive power.
---
Yea I know about that, or even top tree is also strong. But was curious about locks melee (since its much faster, than charging grenade). I was thinking that I missed some update about locks.
---
I’m gonna give it my all. Thanks.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
I really needed this
---
You are acting as if the knife reload works at base, all the time. You need to actually dodge near an enemy as well as actually use that dodge ability (which personally I dont because I find a free reload much more helpful than the chance of a melee reload). How many people actually use the tumble dodge when hunter melee isnt really that good? Not saying it needs a buff, just that it's not so amazing that being able to dodge and use melee a 2nd time isnt that useful. I find a quick reload on a machine gun or shotgun much more useful.
---
Meh

Thx

If I’m correct we had a Huckleberry sparrow in Black Armory, another wouldn’t hurt though
---
&gt; when they have something broken it’s silence 
---
So why is it that when hunters get something broken its at the very least fixed in that season? Wormhusk was nerfed HELLA fast in comparison to strikers and oem. Spectral blades received several nerfs over the past year, all of them well deserved, including the reduction of the wallhacks to 3 seconds. When gwisin vest was broken and gave spectrals pretty much infinite super, it was corrected within that season. Meanwhile titans get away with a broken exotic and cheesey ohk abilities and a super that was able to steamroll a team three times, from one spawn to the other (And the only reason they dont do that rn is because of the overall super nerfs, not a nerf to the super in general, thats yet to come and it will be a beautiful day) but is still the most obnoxious titan super in the game, hell super in the gamer period, but is STILL untouched. (we are not counting the general super nerf as ALL classes received that).
---
Meanwhile, get an artifact mod that lasts one season and gives a split second overshield and everyone whines, because they dont have the patience to not shoot for literally a second until the overshield goes away, meanwhile titans get a stronger overshield than the one you spawn in with, for multiple seasons thats only just getting taken away, and people are already yelling about hunters over an ability that is not in the game yet. I swear if bungie nerfs that knife but doesnt touch all the other ohk abilities in the same breath, there's something seriously wrong here lol

Laughs in that top tree solar warlock melee he saw in the trailer...

I also use all 3 and the tweet is very far from being correct. SC/hand held apes are only a problem for average play on console. Both are easy to out play if someone is just focusing on it.
---
Hunters also have good melee. To say otherwise is just an ignorant statement. If anyone has the right to bitch about melee its warlocks with their slower meleeing. It literally means in a straight up punch fight even if the lock swings first both other classes will land their second melee first.

It took 4 months longer to nerf spectral than it took to nerf nova warp. That was when spectral guaranteed super until you got 5 kills. Spectral **still** gives infinite wallhacks while nova warp is dirt

I feel like ppl get upset that titans make bad players better than they are. Who cares? I’m worried about Legend tier Glory players and Hunters have the most advantages by far. Which is why you see mostly hunters at that level.  These subreddits are controlled by Hunters though and we will be downvoted to hell and Bungie will continue to listen to their cries.
---
Ho ho ho don't mind if i do
---
I always love that thats how the classes are presented, yet in game lore its always titans and especially warlocks who are edgy, with hunters being goofy jokesters with varying levels of capability for seriousness. I can tell you I'd switch mains in a heartbeat if warlocks didnt look the way they do in d2 though. But I really main both for pvp technically so there's that.

Being able to map any super in a hitscan shot is hardly weak. People just suck and don't land headshots.  It's not like melee roaming supers net more than 3 kills on average anyway.

---
Titans have never been a meta pick for comp play in D2 and have consistently been on the bottom.
---
Hunters have been the top and will continue to be the top for having some of the best neutral game in the game in addition to the strongest selection of supers.

Everything you've listed is pub stomp material. Not high level comp material.

For sure. I see I replied virtually the same thing to two of your comments.  But yeah it’s really out of hand at this point.  The game is pretty balanced but since Y1 I  was always most annoyed by Hunters if anyone. I only came to the subreddit during Forsaken and I was amazed to see the direct correlation between what Bungie sees as “needs fixing” and what Hunters relentlessly complain about.  Meanwhile my warlock’s significantly slower melee speed is still ignored.

Why? Here's why.
---
When you get a prime engram, the level of the engram depends on your light level when you got it. So unless you increase your light level, every engram you get will be the same level. So if you open each on, they will just be the same level and you won't increase your light level much if not at all.
---
However, if you open the engram the moment you get it and use the item to increase your light level, the next engram you get will be a higher level to match your new light level. Keep doing this to increase your light and increase the level of the engram.

No the player thinking they are hot shit and the others are scrubs is the issue. I've seen it with multiple competitive teams. One player who thinks they are better then the team, they try to be the carry, they may have more kills but teamwork&gt; solo play. I don't give a shit if you have a .5kda, a 1 kda or a 3.0kda if you are amazing you'll never get far.

Is, is that a pistol with an underbarrel attachment?
---
Cayde :( unless that time thingy means we are gonna save him aswell
---
Based Wormwood is based
---
&gt; Hunters have no one shot kill other then the precision throwing knife and that's IF you get the headshot.
---
Incorrect...it cannot OHK unless that Guardian has already taken damage. I've precision hit with precision knife on a full health enemy and it did about 90% of the enemy's total health. The only stipulation I can think of is if the guardian has a less than 10 Resilience stat...but every time I've nailed the precision melee, it won't kill unless the guardian has already taken damage.
---
Handcannon scav and extra ammo and go altar. You can get it done in like an hour if not less.
---
The new season looks awesome.
---
Bungie should have surprised us. Now we're all going in with the big reveal already spoiled, just like Forsaken. I liked the Uldren and Pork Pie twist. I never saw that one coming. Alas the hype train must reach full steam so people buy the season pass. Can't say I blame them since many wouldn't want to go back to Mercury otherwise, but that's their fault for Mercury being badly designed and being the weakest DLC.
---
Doomguy in an alternate reality!
---
Stupid idea but what if he was revived as a npc that you could play raids and strikes with?
---
Yes they have a bigger potential of kills. But the higher you go in skill brackets the less that matters. In this case being able to one bang supers from a distance is a very strong benefit.
---
When you close the gap you're more likely to die to say a shotgun from a guardian who's baiting your entrence.
---
Titans best super in my opinion is the roaming shield. As you get a throwable with the function of blocking and you can easily jump to get easier access to your strong hit.
---
The only other roaming supers imo that can rival GGs strengths is tickle fingers top tree and dawn blade. Both have good movement and decent range potential.
---
Nova warp with blink as jump technically has the best movement capabilities but the super itself is rather weak.
---
Were just lucky this isn't D1 golden gun or no other super would even be close to rivaling it. But I still insist that bottom tree GG is one of the strongest supers in the game.
---
Hey guys, how do I throw my hammer?
---
*Titan has scored a kill*
---
*Titan is on a 5 kill streak*
---
Nevermind, I figured it out.
---
Is that Slimer from Ghostbusters?
---
I actually like that idea. Helps with people who have no friends like me 😂
---
Better than last seasons.
---
Hunters will figure out quick that the one hit kill mechanics are not that great to begin with. Shoulder charge is suicide against even an average player. Handheld supernova is good in the right hands but isn't that "great" at all
---
&gt; hunters dominate the majority in everything 
---
\-Melees: NONE are oneshots without exotics or near perfect precision throwing knives. Almost every other subclasses from the other 2 classes both have near perfect 100% kill rate on hit, or just some huge utility.
---
\-Grenades: Grenades? Hunters? They are just throwing homing pebbles who will only kill an already wounded enemy or if the enemy is PERFECTLY still. Not even close to anything Warlock can do with grenades (Or even solar grenade cheese from Titan)
---
\-Supers: Middle tree nightstalker is the only super for Hunters that is anywhere near the lethality of the other classes' supers. Gunslinger and bladedancer both require enemies to be waiting for you to kill them to be worth it, Sharpshooter is a literal joke. Arcstrider supers are ok, and only because they get decent with some exotics. Both top and bottom tree nightstalkers are just worse gunslingers.
---
\-Class ability: literally only used for PVE cooldown refreshes and some rare cheesy strategies like the recent arc-battery + worm husk, which was literally a worse version of OEM and still got nerfed.
---
\-Neutral play: Hunters' neutral is arguably amongst the best depending of the subclasses... if you count BOTH PVE and PVP options. Nearly every Hunter subclasses contain neutral power boosters that are either good in PVE and literally unusable in PVP, or good in PVP and literally unusable in PVE. This just makes Hunter feel like having only 2 or 3 relevant class perks in permanence, since 1 or 2 will almost always be useless, decided on the context. Other classes' neutral still pale in comparison to this, but this is very easily fixed by the INSANE Warlock and Titan exotics who take their neutral to a whole other level. Meanwhile, Hunters have Shadow Dragon and Wormhusk with barely anything else. 
---
\-Jumps: Yeah, Hunters have the best jumps. Hunters-1, Warlock and Titans-32743266841
---
Have you ever been face to face with someone wielding and exotic sword and felt no fear?
---
The Havoc Pigeon has.
---
Yea but it's not copy paste. Each one has a specific animation for each subclass.
---
Gptta kill the cyclopses / rotating shield boye
---
Huh. 
---
GIVE ME THE SKY RAT OF HAVOC
---
If you had any amount of scientific literacy, you would understand that your personal anecdotes qbout killing more hunters than either other class, or general distaste for them, are not useful input, they are just anecdotes. 
---
My lack of high rank does not change all the freely available data that I have been recounting to you, that you can easily find and interpret yourself if you want, once you get half an idea how data analysis works.
---
But the *facts* remain that high comp players, like every other subset of players for a particular activity, or the player population as a whole, have been hovering at 'about the same' (i reused my euphemism this time, happy?) class distribution literally since the game launched. This does include there being more hunters, but given that there are more hunters in general and the portions per subclass all stay within 'a couple percent' (and again) it is indicative of a constantly changing player population without any discrepancies significant enough to indicate deeper problems.
---
Kinda why I thought of it
---
That was what I did as well. Took over an hour for me
---
Do you PVE bro?
---
Ahhh after the 15 I should of put hydras lol
---
No problem. Also, I should clarify: you can get the old campaign reward exos from random drops still, you just don't get anything for doing any of the story (pre-shadowkeep).
---
Have they? I can see the problem with melees being slower now that it doesn't have extended range, but what else is there? (I don't really count Seasonal Mods since those are temporary)
---
I've been having this inner debate/struggle whether I want to main Hunter or Warlock. Warlock abilities seem so much more useful/cool/fun to me, so that they've been left behind is news to me

---
And that's a fair point to make. I am just trying to bring to light that pvp in destiny 2 is an entirely different experience depending on skill bracket and platform/input device.
---
If people want to tell me that titans are incredibly stompy in an average players experience that's a statement I can be fine with.
---
My issue with posts in this thread in general is just the boldness of claims coming from people who really lack the knowledge to speak so diffinitively.
---
Recluse gonna get nerfed next week
---
Yes do the quest, but it requires running the forges to complete
---
I doubt he’s “alive” again, considering the time travel, my money is on us only interacting with him in the past, where we will finally be able to bring him his shotgun, so he can leave it for us again.
---
Yes, no reason not to.
---
we’ve met a previous warlock vanguard, and are about to meet a previous titan vanguard, when are we going to meet a hunter va-. oh.
---
My least favorite grind was the polaris lance catalyst, you have to get kills with perfect fifth burn damage. If you get a kill with the bullet itself, or even the explosion, it doesn't count. Has to kill with BURN DAMAGE
---
I've played Warlock a lot this Season, and I like my Discipline. Whenever I used it, it had one-shot range at a little over max Shotty range &amp; any hit was a kill. I've definitely killed before hitting half of them, and the enemy had not been damaged yet
---
I do play all 3, actually and the tribalism was old 6 months ago.  Didn't hear or see anyone speaking up then...also, wouldn't the same apply to all the whiny bitch ass hunters complaining about bottom tree and OEM?  I'm sure you levied this useful nugget of wisdom to them in every OEM/Titan bitch post over the past year as well.
---
I'd use bottom tree for both PvE and PvP, but thats just my opinion
---
My Titan idolizes saint 14. My favorite armor set includes his exotic helmet. Can’t wait to meet his idol! Punching contest time!

---
I try my damndest to snipe people out of their supers.
---
SHIT
---
Middle arc is also very good, don't overlook getting 3+ supers a game in survival when everyone else gets 1-2.
---
Because we killed the undying mind, we have power to manipulate the infinite forest, and potentially find where Saint-14 disappeared to. And let the trailer, either he gets out himself, or we do it.
---
Lmaoooo
---
In need Shaxx to yell "stab away guardian"
---
Its not the case anymore. I think that was an activision thing that had to have ps exclusives because of some partnership. Its  possible cross play between all three could be the next big thing. I remember hearing somewhere about the team being really interested in it but take that with a grain of salt
---
Ho look another whiny Hunter, been a long time.... Ho wait....
---
Why u get downvoted?
---
Hammer strike is a one shot, shield bash is a one shot, seismic strike is a shot one, all three elements have a one shot ability, not to mention this season y'all had oppressive darkness with magnetic grenades that one shot and that could be used on any void class. Warlocks only can do that on one skill tree. We aren't even talking about supers either, just regular abilities.
---
Lmao the undying has me cracking tf up

Check my profile. I don't have OEM. What crutch do I use?
---
Yes and brought to us the fact that there indeed is, and always was, more of a percentage of hunters at high comp than the general player base. You took it upon yourself to determine it negligible. 
---
Try working forward from data to conclusion.  Rather than picking your conclusion first, then ignoring the data when it’s provided.  
---
PS...I see you ignored my call out that you’re likely not a college grad the same way you ignored my Glory call out. I’m seeing a trend (that’s science talk).
---
&gt; San 14
---
*inhales* Boi
---
The fact that they all stand there and die without realizing that they're being damaged is hilarious.
---
Top tree void is really bad for competitive, as it is extremely hard to get more than one kill and you’re competing with supers that get two to three regularly, or at least with much more ease. I like it a lot for iron banner and control though because void warp gets shut down often in 6v6 and more enemies means bigger nova bombs (I got four once but I rly want to get a wipe w it)
---
Pewdiepie? Is that you?
---
yes. Yes. YES.
---
I think that Saint-14 is an entirely new timeline. As Osiris said, we broke time (Thanks Ikora). that statement makes me think that this Saint-14 is not the one we find dead, and also will go away by the end of the season as we have by that point, I presume, have fixed time.
---
I thought you were referring to Perfect Paradox at first and almost flipped
---
Looking back, lumina would def be a pain at this point in time. I got mine the week it released, since back then everyone and their sister was doing everything in their power to make the quest go quick for the community. 6 piece of rose every round in the managerie, Gambit invaders emoting themselves to death, etc. I think the longest step on that for me was the orbs, tbh
---
It's a static roll my man
---
Don’t remember. All I remember is saying “How the f**k did he get me from over there?”  or “I don’t know which one I hate more right the guy with Randy or the guy with Recluse” lol
---
I dont think so, just because of the introduction of the seasonal ornament
---
I do not know what that means
---
Absolutely love how calculated this was!
---
Or whatever the gate lords eye is called
---
We gave him the shotgun before he went back and helped found the city. He knew us even before Six Fronts
---
No one uses those trees though. I get what you mean but those classes make up such a small percent of Titan usage and oppressive darkness was over shadowed by thunder coil, it was as popular as arc battery. Just cause titans have these things doesn’t mean they’re good. I play on face it tournament and not a single player runs shoulder charge of any kind, and this is 1% PvP. Shoulder charge is only good against bad players. In high skill play they’re jokes and easy to counter.
---
Solid scout too
---
:/ I don’t wanna grind bounties for the seasonal artifact again like this season
---
After my friend and I played the first mission separately, we were able to join up.
---
static means all of them come with it.
---
Luna's howl
---
I could be wrong, but the power level grind associated with the marginal increases at 950-960 makes me think they will keep it as is.
---
Just grind out the lost prophecy guns. Once you have them all and the paradox shotgun you get the shell.
---
I’m glad to see you have paid attention to the story. There is a side quest in D2 where you visit his tomb.
---
...for the season, then I'd imagine he'll go away
---
I took it upon myself to examine all the relevent facts, that the same variances exist for each class across all activities, rendering itself negligible?
---
Congratulations, you've shifted goalposts so many times we're back at the beginning.
---
PS I don't care about your callouts but if you must know I'm on my 3rd year for electrical engineering

---
Fillion left after year 1 of D2, all of Cayde's Forsaken voucelines were done by Nolan North.
---
Many people will hate on this gun, but I freaking love it.  Pair it with a good kinetic SMG (think Exit Strategy if you're a glutton for punishment like me) and wreck things.  Also, if you use another hand cannon, like Spare Rations or Austringer with Subsistence... Hand cannon scavenger and ammo finder works wonders.     
---

Give it a try!

Me too. It would give me hope they'll do the same for the other year 1 zones. Especially Titan and Mars.
