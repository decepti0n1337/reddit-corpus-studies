Lmao you don‚Äôt even know what that means but nice try pal

Same. I bow hunt with compound bows irl. Archery has always been something I love and I was hyped when they introduced bows. As you said, the rhythm of it is great. My subtle calamity that I have 31k kills with just has one of those rhythms that honestly reminds me of the bow I shoot irl in terms of drawing. It‚Äôs such a great feel though. Didn‚Äôt take much patience at all, I was hesitant to use them at first in PvP, but then I did and my friends were all amazed with how well I did and it‚Äôs just taken off from there. Now all I run are bows unless something forces me to use a gun. In which case I use my year one allied demand sidearm haha. I‚Äôm freaking Hawkeye over here
---
I somehow got extra valor today like a lot more for winning
---
:D Your bullets were no match for the density of their Jedi auras!
---
Pretty solid work my man.

---
The wife and I spent about 4 hours doing a spiffy Orxy pumpkin and that PoS rotted in less than 3 days bc we live in SoCal. Hope yours holds up better.
---
I just realized I have no idea what my exo's arms look like. Do they all look like Ada-1 without the armor?
---
Shame it‚Äôs from instagram though
---
I‚Äôve only played 3 matches of comp. two matches in a row it paired me with one other rando against teams of 3. Said screw this. Wasn‚Äôt remotely fair.
---
I know, I just started uni and have no time lol
---
In Levi you get a chest at the end of every encounter, and in eow.there are one or two secret chests and one at the end
---
If i got an engram from xur, then switch characters, can i get another one?
---
Teammates are like scavengers
---
Leeeroooyyy Jenkins!
---
Why?
---
The game will never ever be boring, I probably passed 69420 in D1
---
But wait, you didn't get bifurcated. That's now how this works!
---
The Drifter calls me a snitch every time I start a match... Fuck that cool guy lol
---
Pretty sure I read somewhere that their is a secret number aside from your glory rank that determines who you match against that is based off your performance in crucible over all. Because of this I would recommend playing regular crucible a bit so it can calibrate that number better then hop back into survival. I personally don't think it should be that way and feel like comp should be based only on glory rank alone otherwise whats the point of glory rank? But Bungie just keeps doing Bungie things.
---
Yes. We call that mmr. New players and bad players(being a vet doesn't make you not bad) will have starting mmr. This is not a new concept at all and standard for most. Smh....
---
Nope.
---
Because it‚Äôs bungie
---
It should pop up ‚Äúmarked for vengeance‚Äù on the last panel
---
Closest I think of are the camo shaders from EDZ.
---
That thing is my go to sniper now, if I ever change my triple bow Loadout.
---
One per account I believe
---
Saw it coming, still loved every second building up to it.
---
Dog is confused
---
Survival of the fittest is a saying. This game mode is called Survival... Hmmmm with this being said. If you want to be the best you have to beat the best. You're not going to get better playing potatoes.
---
"STANDO POWAAAAHHHH!!!"
---
Nice
---
Never go for 15 until your portal is opened and you have an invader stopping them from getting portals. Easiest way to win is to never let them deposit
---
That is correct.  The Ghost was named Tianshi, and his story can be found in the Ghost Stories lore book.
---
I never collect except the scraps. Unless I can coordinate with voice, I don't expect my teammates to think strategy. So I just kill from a distance.
---
Oh cool, thanks for the confirmation
---
Nah he knows his marked that's his only option
---
SAME. Agreed
---
Lol!
---
I try to teach people they say to chill it‚Äôs just gambit so that doesn‚Äôt work. And this is across several games

I have the other three keys and the black armory lady doesn't offer the mold so I think it's still bugged.

This is me

Literally every game of gambit.

Lol! No shit! Really?!? What did it decrypt into?ü§£üòÇ
---
Haha true, Luna nerf changed everything, I sure miss mountaintop/well in gambit with an occasional 60% boss damage
---
I just wanna know where they came from
---
I love this song, it plays when you unlock your new super and it sounds amazing killing everything in there while this song plays.
---
Gambit is the game mode where players don't need Rat King to activate Rat Pack perk.
---
This season's Ritual weapons aren't pinnacle drops.
---
All three dropped at 950 for me (while I was above 960).
---
I mean he is pretty important, he has a contained chunk of ascendant plane and is one of the oldest living guardians
---
Nah but as a single-player game it still has finite playability
---
Death stranding is gonna suck. Kojima has peaked. 
---
You won't be missed. Delete your guardians and all you're gear if you're so sure you aren't coming back mate. Otherwise quiet. Lol
---
No. Shin Malphur became a guardian at a young age and grew up while possessing the light.

You are a very helpful guardian üíú

I love it

It's far easier to hide from a sniper rifle than almost any other type of weapon, because there's really nothing you can do about someone walking into a building if you're using one.
---
thats really good aim for a storm trooper
---
It's a team game. Play for your team, not yourself.
---
Google "destiny 2 reddit questname"

I was so hyped for Borderlands 3 and managed to get all the trophies in 5 days. But once Shadowkeep dropped I never looked back. I don't even have desire to play the Halloween event. I'll go back for story DLC but I definitely don't see myself playing it like I do with Destiny.
---
It's mainly all the stupid nerfs that make me not wanna play. At any point they could hot fix and destroy a build you spent days farming for.
---
I'd wager the change to semi-transparent health bars with Forsaken was almost entirely to combat AHK aimbots.
---
Bullet Magnetism is affected by aim assist and this is the second highest aim assist sniper in the game with a targeting adjuster and enhanced sniper rifle targetting.
---
Not buying BL3 until the beta testing is over, which is when it comes out on steam in about a year.
---
I dont know the book, but his guardian mentor was killed by the darkness(thorn) and was unable to be resurrected. His ghost chose shin, an "apprentice" of sorts, as her new guardian
---
I don't mean to question you... but I did that and it didn't count for one. Are you sure? I've yet to talk to anyone who has the triumph in game and I've gotten different answers from everyone.
---
How could you say something so controversial yet so brave
---
I would be fime playing the same 5 maps if all maps that were designed around 4v4 were removed
---
Literally LOL ‚Äì thanks.
---
If you have a teammate wearing all invader gear, and the invader emblem with over 100 team wipes, DON‚ÄôT take the fucking heavy, and DON‚ÄôT take the portal.  This is law.

I think they only ban for virtual mouse movement. I've been using AHK since D2's release to fix weapon switch binds and add single button sparrow dodging.

Apparently hes only around sometimes.. and appears.. in random locations.

Yes he does, we just haven‚Äôt seen it yet.

For such an amazing game Bungie does a shit job of explaining things. Lucky for you, and me, the community is amazing so literally just google the quest name followed by Destiny 2 and you‚Äôll find whatever you need. Pretty sure we all do it pretty often.
---
Man watching them go back and forth is really badass...

Am I the only one hopping between the two?

Xur is a npc who sells 4 exotics and a fated engram every Friday to Monday (US Friday to Monday). He appears randomly in either the tower, Titan, io, Nessus or the EDZ, with no marker on the map. Instead you can just google ‚Äúwhere is xur‚Äù and it‚Äôll give you his location and inventory. The fated engram drops a new exotic, only one per account each time he appears, but costs 97 legendary shards I believe.
---
Sure its a team game that's why we team shot  witches but if i kill a group of enemies i should get the motes i almost died and i aint see none of them help. ( i was just salty cuz i was grinding for exit strategy)
---
Yes
---
As a Reaper (who mostly solo-q‚Äôd to his Dredgen title) you should have kept killing. Not getting to put the motes in the bank yourself doesn‚Äôt matter so long as they get in there. 
---
If this happens, your role changes. Keep slaying and WATCH THAT MOTE BAR. If you‚Äôre about to get invaded, guess who‚Äôs job it is to shut that dark guardian down? You‚Äôve got no motes; it‚Äôs your job now. 
---
Go with the flow. Your team will thank you for it.
---
Thats what the warlock said when it turned backed to look at me.
---
Anytime I go for motes this happens. 
---
Anytime I decide to sit back and just get kills the motes all time out. 
---
The true struggle in life is Gambit.
---
Is there a reddit or steam clan?  If not then what are the popular clans for new players?
---
Of you understand it's a team game then don't be selfish, it doesn't master who picks them up as long as they get deposited.
---
Is wanted bullet an actual term that I haven't heard of? I thought it was just some really wack example of bullet magnetism going too far.
---
Yea i understand that i was just salty cuz i was going for exit strategy

Ok WF vet and NL player here to tell you that OP made this post to bait arguments. You are wrong about warframe being p2w though. Really what it comes down to is the lack of proper guidance for new players. You can buy things if you want but the issue with that is that the game is about the journey to get said things. So essentially if you buy items in WF you're paying to lose.
---
I just played through it last week and got zilch
---
Worst is when you're in that one vex strike where you climb that floating tower. God damned game ALWAYS spawns you so far back you only catch up once they've reached the boss room.
---
my ps4 didn‚Äôt have enough space when d2 became from so i deleted borderlands 3 lol
---
I always use that on all my masterworked legendary guns. I love when my guns look like they were owned by a Liberian warlord.
---
My crossbow has around 180. That's enough lmao
---
I‚Äôm working on the mountain too along side throwing knife... shit is pissing me off lol
---
This whole damn post was bait and you give a bad name to the WF community.
---
I got Slowva Bombed, respwaned and was killed by the Nova scatter. I feel your pain.

Another problem is that if  I aim for the head, I miss.  I believe its going high.  I have, literally, had the cursor on a targets head and missed 5 straight shots.   So I am at the chest and hope for the best.
---
I went into crucible for like 5 days trying to get mountaintop and was like yeahhhh this isnt for me lol

üòÇüòÇ I need the medals and double kills for mountain top ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Yes and that would fit the hell fire piece great 
---
Nothing like having your enemies explode in fire and blue alien blood
---
When i want this to happen it never happens, but the one time i want to pick up motes!
---
No it's in the underground area, I forget the name right now, it's where that one public event is to stand in the platforms.
---
Holy crap has it actually been a year ?!
---
This.  
---
If you don't have motes to lose, rush the shit out of that invader. Worst case scenario is that he kills you and gets a kill worth nothing more than an extra kill to his credit for being returned - best case is that you kill him.  
---
If three people are rushing me during an invade when one guy has 15 and is hiding, the chances of me getting to that guy with 15 are pretty damn small.

Just play the game and you will get exotics from quests and activities.

*Insert Obama medal meme
---
If they could, I don‚Äôt think their child would have light because only ghosts choose who has light and thus no one can have light without a ghost. Also guardians MUST die before becoming a guardian, and not anyone who dies can be a guardian. Guardians, as I understand based on the Speakers words, must be *brave* warriors who experience *sacrifice* and ultimately *die*. A new child has done none of these and so they would not be guardians at their birth, but they may become one and they would remain the age at which they died.
---
Weird... I did it with Dreambane and it didn't count for me. I guess I'l try again. Maybe it got bugged or something...

Man, Exit Strategy is gonna be an uphill climb for you!

Which micro transactions are you talking about? I‚Äôd love to know.

As if hunters and warlocks use auto rifles, does this subreddit actually believe half the stupid shit it says?
---
God I wish comp didn‚Äôt allow Daybreak to just win matches
---
It takes forever to draw, but it's like letting a nuke fly, bow uses power ammo
---
Because hunters cant go 5 minutes without complaining about titans
---
God I hate that. I know it‚Äôs a team effort, but the bounties require the individual effort.
---
Once for the free players and one of the incentives of the premium pass is instant access to the gun
---
if it makes u feel any better. i just played a round where my 3 team mates continued to kill shit instead of our blockers. we went from 48 to zero and they ignored it the whole time. I tried to kill em myself but its dam hard when its 2 bloody captains
---
Playing regular Gambit and not Prime makes the grind faster, btw. 2-3 matches that didn't require re-queuing goes faster than a single match of Prime...and for some reason, I get a lot more medals with regular Gambit.
---
Get These strikes.  
---
Lake of shadows  
---
Will of a thousands.  
---
Or Strange terrain, get 2 friends and start the strike, when you spawn in you can go to the lost sectors on Earth and Mars and farm it there, theres no timer so you can just leave the Lost sector and then re enter it, thats how i got the Timeless vigil emblem and my buddy is working on Edgewise and the emblem itself for it, just run special/power ammo finishers and you can be done easily.
---
ah yes cool nicotine
---
That, and I feel like the BL3 story was absolutely fucking terrible. I ended my first playthrough at level 32 and won‚Äôt be playing again. I actually just uninstalled it this week.

PC, been that way for about eight years

Any word if they'll be upping the light level cap next season?
---
What I am confused
---
Who‚Äôs gonna tell him

HAHA bruh

You should play Forsaken if you have it, it has a great story.
---
Ha. You suck.

I refuse to finish the quest btw I'm PC as well

Wish i wouldve knew that
---
Gone. Reduced to atoms.
---
No I don‚Äôt have it I only have warmind and curse of Osiris
---
Wait no do you mean
---
I agree before I could even move the same dawn blade killed me.  Also saw a striker titan 15 feet away when I spawned fun

Play forsaken and you'll see

Just have a single designated lore-master in case lore is needed to advance

Friendly Inquiry. What have you done to bring such hostility to my subreddit?
---
I don‚Äôt think gambit matches off of rank, instead using connection, like most other match made activities. I think they allow like a 5 minute window to rejoin, but since destiny takes like 10 minutes to reconnect to the internet and start the game again, it‚Äôs pretty hard to get back in the match
---
Wait are all enemies arc except vex
---
He died
---
just started playing, and I did find myself running to cover, and trying to find good positions. Tho the lack of mobility is sorta peeving me out.
---
Considering you have a kd only .3 higher than your teammates? No
---
Negative chief
---
Must've been a lot of human dusters around back then....
---
Yeah it should be dupe protection
---
Buy forsaken. Lots of great content and The storyline is kinda fun? You go rogue.
---
You have to remember that the person who is watching you spawn, actually still has the advantage. You cant do anything when you first spawn. You're stuck in an animation, but you can take damage in that animation. And by then you're already getting flinched and missing more shots.
---
Ohh ok that makes more sense. I remember going through the Red War campaign and constantly hearing Ikora and Zvala be like 'Wow, if only there was some way to get out light back...if only' and me just sitting there like .-.
---
Thanks.
---
No 
---
Titan: punchy punch
---
Hunter: standby mc stab
---
In  my opinion the thing that matters most in survivel is your kda, sure you need kills 2 but it's importent not to die2 ;)
---
I need that. But the nostalgic engram doesn't have that.
---
Hopefully üôèüèº
---
No, but the thrall melee you with arc and the wizards also hit you with arc, the fallen have the gun peeps and those arc staff dudes. The cabal have the shield brutes who shoot arc, and the scorn also have arc jerks. Youre golden! The vex also have an arc enemy but I can't remember who and they aren't as common as the other factions
---
Hiverap supreme with an ice cold cabal-blast
---
I‚Äôm just sick of these destiny 1 weapons being absolutely shit when they get brought back
---
This is amazing
---
Yep
---
hmmm Well I hope Theres a way to get around this. I'd hate to use my Psiphon VPN since it slows down my internet (I heard VPN's protect you from DDos), I would much rather Bungie implement something like what TF2 has. Being able to rejoin the match within a certain amount of time with a notification, Or atleast I hope Me playing More Gambit matches than being DC balances it out in someway, or nullifies the penalties I have yet to get. (Which i fear getting banned from Gambit oneday all because some prick ingame sucked at the game and DDosed me and my team possibly)
---
Shaxx wears his heart on his sleeve. He will tell you he loves you and is proud of you wether you win or lose. He is like a kind father only wanting to watch all of us grow as guardians. Drifter is the father who went to buy cigarettes when i was a kid and never came back.

Damn thanks didnt know so many enemies had arc might try it out

We all know that should be a warlock. Most Titans are too busy punching things and eating crayons to be tricking people.
---
There‚Äôs roles you can choose? How?

Ye its way too easy. I like the freelance playlist, but I just dont understand why they didn't leave the matchmaking as is ( glory based). Games at 500 points have the same intensity as games at 5500

You will decimate with the riskrunner. Perfect for getting the "ritual" weapon

You did the right thing by sharing it with us.

You either have to have fire nades or a solar spec weapon. Erianas vow is great at gambit honestly. It 3 shots sentries and 1 shots every shield, feels great. If it had firefly I‚Äôd get moist everytime I pull the trigger.
---
The supposedly hotfixed it and now im getting into games where my team has a 80-90% chance of losing according to destin

They will grow old and die, and are guaranteed to be reborn as guardians

Thought the speaker didn't have a class?
---
I just performed an ocular patdown and he's clear.
---
You said you were a casual player, but you're going for Unbroken. I'm afraid you're not a casual with ambition like that. You have to hit legend three times. Good luck then.
---
Nice ok thank you man
---
Are you a Registered Vex Offender?
---
I was thinking about getting Outer Worlds honestly, the game looks so good ant it reminds me of a Fallout type space shooter. Especially with that six shooter on the trailer.. Oof. It looks good.
---
But come on man.. You're really tryna make people mad just because you're high or some shit? Grow a pair of balls and enjoy Outer Worlds instead of wasting your time.
---
No one said that. They want to have Armor that looks like Ada, not for Ada to have Armor.
---
Indeed sir!

What are you looking at Guardian? Content is temporary...the glory of the Vex is/was/is forever!

Are you running the laptop off of your actual GPU or are you running it off of the onboard GPU?

The person you get the mission from literally says she had the vision too but is too old and weak to go herself.

Oh damn

It looks so good but I have yet to acquire it :(

Is it a drop on curated weapons from the Izanagi forge?
---
Y o i n k

Also, that setup is absolutely more than fine to run the game at high and run smoothly at 1080p. Like, low settings shouldn't be a thing with those specs.

yup

got that one and the one from the challenge at the farm.
---
Pepelaugh wrong emote

Gracias! &lt; 3

I'm running it off of the GeForce GPU
---
I mean... yes?

That is exactly how almost every other competitive PvP game does this. You basically just described what an mmr system is: separate new players from veteran players simply assuming, at the beginning, that new players are bad and veteran players are good, based on prior matches and history.
---
Eventually, after a while everyone's mmr adjusts itself and makes the player fall in the cathegory he's supposed to be.
---
Too soon , too soon man :(
---
Learn to TYPE first then come back leva lololol.
---
How do i get that NPC? I have been there, but I don't see him?
---
At least they banked em. If only I could get teammates who do that.

Template pls?

Part time cowboy. Full time dead.
---
the problem is when they make their f2p game feel like you are missing content from the dlcs and scare people away since the game feels just like a glorified demo for the dlcs. First polish the f2p expirence than when the people are hooked in they will get the dlcs since they want to play more content, no need to push the dlcs this hard in every point of the game
---
this is nothing, trust me man
---
That happened to me once I saw a target marked for vengeance and it was my teammate. Was so confused and yes I did try to shoot him.
---
It‚Äôs because they were additional or weekly bounties. 
---
Old Shaxx only wants those daily ones from us
---
Either way titan OP !
---
I did my Exit Strategy grind in prime so I could grind out Vow‚Äôs catalyst at the same time. Prime gave 2% per match.
---
What‚Äôs funny is that. We both have same armour, loadout, ornaments, same gun same exotic and doing the same thing lol
---
Been rocking this since last week after the novelty of mobius quiver wore off. Attached arc melee stagger and thunder coil perks. 
---
Been stun locking bosses and ultras like they‚Äôre made of paper, 1 punching overload champions and general doom guy shenanigans.
---
PONCH ALL THE VEX.
---
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a lotta dropped motes brother!‚Äù
---
Just grind strikes, you get a guarantee of 2 or 3 blues per run. For the strike, you just need to run a mid range Loadout that can quickly get rid of orange bars, and keep moving and stay near cover
---
Pillager is a really good kinetic SMG also.
---
You know they‚Äôre on your team right?
---
I love how in the end youre just like
---
"what the hell am I even doing this for?"
---
Also try r/destinysherpa for first runs
---
It's not a easy last fight maybe just gear up a bit  more 910 920 will be easier for everyone
---
Fighting Lion is built by a Hand-Cannon.
---
Oops, forgot 900 is soft cap. Just run your weekly powerful gear. The moon has a lot of powerful rewards between Eris and Vex offensive
---
This is why I melee everything
---
Wish Ender is more of a ‚Äútool‚Äù than a weapon. Is there a DPS reason you want it?
---
Who cares about barrel color? If you‚Äôre using it correctly it should be white 80% of the time. ;)
---
The trick up out sleeves is a fist.
---
Once you reached the 900 ‚Äúsoft cap‚Äù you gonna want to do all the milestones that award powerful gear. You can find them in the tower or on the navigator when you hover over different activities like strikes and crucible. 
---
One way to level up fast, at least in my opinion is to do 8 Zavala bounties while you do 3 regular strikes and 5 ordeal strikes on level 750 (you can select the difficulty) 
---
Do the same with lord Shaxx, get 8 bounties and play the crucible playlists. You get powerful gear from ranking up in crucible as well! 
---
Then is the drifter, same thing, 8 bounties and some gambit matches.
---
While doing all of that you will always get Prime engrams that you will have to trade in at the tower. They award powerful gear as well.

One day, I got one of the bones for the Deathbringer quest. After looking at my phone for 5 min or something, while in the Chamber of the Night, an Unstoppable Ogre appeared. I was way underleveled, so I left. I came back today to fight it, killed it, and a chest appeared. Go find your answer. I found mine.
---
I use the survival freelance but I usually do control for the wins

---
Thanks but that's not really what I'm asking, I'm wondering if there are any limited time things I'll miss by that time?
---
Shaxx is the most powerful being in the multiverse of course he isn‚Äôt a crayon eating screaming child
---
Oh so imma have to wait a good 4 days for it... damn
---
I started at 200 glory bout two hours ago and then I got to 2100
---
Didn't they fix the Telesto exploit in well within days?
---
I'm a new light player how can I attend raids ? o.O
---
Yeah like I‚Äôm talking a pretty small chunk of health here like maybe 1/15 of your bar
---
seems like the only nice one is Nezarec‚Äôs sin tbh
---
There are some ambiguous legendary and exotic quests, yes. There are also a great majority of simple quests. 
---
‚ÄúGo shoot this 300 times‚Äù okay easy like nearly every single quest.‚Äù 
---
‚ÄúWhat does the fox say?‚Äù Uh...time to look this one up lol.
---
Crucible has 2 ranks based on mode, Valor and Glory, Valor cant go down so hitting legend rank in it solo is pretty easy if you like pvp and play a lot, Glory rank is like the "Ranked" pvp mode in other games and can go back down on losses. it should be noted though that some good gear can only be obtained through Glory ranks.  
---
the majority of Crucible modes use Valor, i think its only survival that uses Glory.. someone will probably correct me on the specific modes that give what, im more of a PVE player.
---
You can either join a clan or use an lfg system, either discord on pc or the destiny 2 club/app on console. Look up some guides before and prepare for the best shooter experience of your life.
---
It‚Äôs on earth this week
---
Btw. I am not saying recovery is useless or to not use that instead of resilience.  
---
It's more like don't use the bottom 3 garbage attributes discipline, intellect and strength that are only up every 30s to 4 minutes and use mobility 7, resilience 10 and recovery 5 or something like that. And then go ahead and use mods like Enhanced Assets to Ashes and Enhanced Momentum Transfer for full glory. ;)
---
Depends on how good the enemy team is at hiding.  It seems like most people just keep on keepin' on and they're pretty easy to pick off.  The others?  Well if you're a good shot and setup far enough away with good sight lines, it's basically a 3 shot sniper - with the added bonus that on every 5th precision hit you get a free mini-grenade to shoot behind someone in cover.
---
Join a clan my guy, I recommend Winter they're super friendly (shameless clan promotion yes)
---
You had me until the BM. That's a cringe from me.
---
It's endearing and entertaining at the same time.
---
To be honest I‚Äôd much rather just get the kills and they can have all the motes they want. Too frequently people will kill steal when you are aiming for specific weapon kills.
---
Ah, I see all you hunters were listening when Titan 101 was being taught in the tower on Thursday at 4:00 AM. Punch everything... (this comment was based on a true story, if you were there, huge shout out)
---
I never understood the "damage reduction isn't the same as health increase" rubbish.
---
Yep, you had to be there to get it.
---
Fuck you.
---
*^(Now I can't unsee it either)*
---
Mine dropped from the inverted spire strike, just from the playlist
---
He is so resolute that the Ahamkara skull above him doesn't even have an effect anymore.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
There are more broken exotics for titan than an oem üòâ
---
really? i've made a totally different experience there. for me, covering my team and getting trades if necessary is way more rewarding. but then again i guess that's a playstyle thing.
---
I know I am going to get a couple of them for the weekend
---
[OP was like](https://ci.memecdn.com/9451764.gif)
---
Where is xur?
---
My dude. üòÜ I've literally had the same occurrence with an asshole using Jade Rabbit, two tapped me before i was even fully "spawned."
---
Its not a "be on guard" its a "you can get fucked by their little spawn in animation &amp; because theres no sightline checks." 
---
If anyone is farming the Eriana's vow Catalyst for a day, they'll see it. 
---
Hell, in Survival &amp; Classic mix, ive spawned away from my entire team, behind the enemy team, and proceeded to get rolled because everyone's supers apparently last for years, and mines about 3 seconds. 
---
Seriously, if they removed the spawn in animation, it would stop a lot of the spawn kills with no time to react.
---
Then again, so would spawns with LoS checks.
---
Season of the Undying will be coming to a close, so things like the Vex Offensive mode will be going away permanently at the end of the month.
---
Other than that everything stays.
---
I got my first exotic engram yesterday, but it was a broken telesto, that can‚Äôt be equipped now. Donno be happy or sad for it
---
https://twitter.com/cchocolace?s=09
---
Sorry but this offefnisv,, as titan i very cool and have very high inteleggenege
---
Yh I usually get a pick then get my whole team to rush the other 2 or I will just kill them all myself. Comp is great way of farming gold medals
---
Nice that‚Äôs going to look very nice
---
to be fair, Where I live we don't have coyote problems, so if I moved to America I'd be kinda fucked
---
We prefer Cucklocks
---
Insert" obamagivinghimselfamedal.jpeg"
---
@.@ mark this as nsfw please lol
---
because he's not an uncivilized ape
---
sounds like someone never got Ballyhoo
---
my will is not my own, but whatcha buyin?
---
Seems about right. Blueberries have been so annoying since Gambit was made available to F2Pers. Not playing with a 3 or 4 stack is so painful now.
---
Random drop running strikes and nightfalls is how I got mine last week
---
You had the resources to to empty the store before buying and then take the random roll, but you didn't. Moron had it coming.
---
theres that bullshit one hit melee........
---
Haha fortnite BaD! Give me orange arrows please.
---
Stopped to see him but nothing unfortunately.
---
This is barely a 48 base stat armor, which is really low. It's +58 because of the +10 bonus from the resilience mod.
---
The only crazy thing here is the distribution.
---
Oh the peak!! He shouldn't have peaked! Lol
---
Nice play.
---
I hate playing against slippery basterds like yourself but I gotta respect the skill.
---
Thank you so fucking much abd ill wait for tuesday then any good replacements for izanagis trynna do garden of salvation first time and need a good loadout
---
I can't cry
---
Thanks- I‚Äôll need it, from what I hear.
---
drifty boy also has them
---
Running into an army by yourself isn't dumb if they are the ones that are going to die.
---
Sometimes I step into the last pulse of a grenade and get the proc. I always say I do it on purpose but I‚Äôm actually just an idiot that doesn‚Äôt know how to not step in pulse grenades.
---
It‚Äôs the variant gambit you really acquire from collections then on the emblem you can choose your variation just like nightfall score emblems
---
Theres a few that break apart into smaller ones when you kill them
---
Badass!
---
Please tell me this isn‚Äôt a skin in fortnite, please please PLEASE
---
Definitely not. Battle royale games are fun. Why do you hate them?
---
After I got my exit strategy I took a nice hot bath to relax my muscles that were as tense as concrete because of the constant stress.
---
my nigga. first frost became my favorite as soon as i saw it
---
So true
---
Really? Which character?
---
As a Titan main I would‚Äôve punched them and probably died. It‚Äôs just what we do best
---
oo, mad monk is clean as hell
---
at the start of the match ive already saw 2 hunters with snipers equipped as their primary weapon, Obviously I wasnt going to contest for that, after a 15 kill streak the guy proceeds to t-bag and I decided to do it back, then the guy added me, I really dont think its that hard to deal with Titans with shoulder charge and melees as I know their weaknesses
---
Please tell me this isn‚Äôt a skin
---
I completely forgot I bought MW and it came out yesterday. Don‚Äôt care. These scout rifle kills aren‚Äôt going to grind themselves!
---
No Hi is not. I sometimes feel that the game tries to screw me in competitive, especially if I'm in winning strike, I'm in middle of a fight, but then i get killed by opponent who've suddenly respawned behind me, even though their side was not occupied by my team.
---
The bosses rotate weekly, so just wait for next reset
---
I don't 100% remember how I got mine but it was not by using scout since I have the medals completed before I got more than 10% in the kills with a scout. I ape'd with my titan in IB for the week and was using a shotgun and Arc battery, so I think when I would get a kill with the shotgun first and then get a string with melee it counted?
---
I was also grinding and finished up reddrix at the same time so, that part just flew by. Now I struggle with the scout kills lol
---
Ahh okay , just keep going at it , if you lose you dont  lose alot of glory , yeah you'll have a couple of team mates but this season ain't really that bad tbh
---
That I can see. I'd like to clarify I go into solo queue specifically because I know 2-stacks would not appreciate being paired with someone that's not 'good enough' for them
---
Moon shot gun can roll with it and the last man standing from gambit prime/reckoning. Also the crown of sorrow raid shotgun.
---
That‚Äôs a black armory crate for the initial weapon chests
---
Turning them into banshee provides a chance for armor mods.
---
Gambit Prime, Reckoning, CoS and GoS
---
For PVE it won't enable you to play clumsy. Still need to take cover when shields are down less than 50%. You will be taking damage from many directions when fscing mobs.
---
As far as PVP it will allow you to take just 1 more head or body shot than players who are not maxed out. For this reason people emphasize recovery and mobility more. Mobility will literally allow you to dodge bullets when strafing. Recovery is self explained. Faster shield regen.
---
How does someone get the Ace of Spades now?
---
I couldn't even finish the story before feeling a compulsive need to come back and okay D2. It didn't grip or motivate me in any way
---
He's only ever been beaten in the crucible once (ikora), he is a strategic mastermind who basically won the battle of the twilight gap and pretty much knew exactly how bad the first assault on the moon was. He has all of Shakespeare's works memorized, and convinced an amahkara to see us as gods
---
No licenses come from the vendor not Bungie
---
Take my upvote, whether you want it or not
---
Garden of salvation  profet of doom had 2 of them drop now with 12 punch
---
Exactly, i personly expect a clear cut difference in quality when I compare to items of different rarity, but it seems like rng can make the more common one better.
---
Welp I think you can only use it in reverie dawn gear now üò¢
---
Pair it with peacekeepers and you‚Äôll be faster than a hunter. Best thing ever.
---
The single most important thing you‚Äôll be missing is the nerf to recluse. It will be bigger than any story Bungie can put together.
---
Sounds like you need to try reading the books. Fall of Reach is amazing.
---
That‚Äôs so dumb
---
He goes where the Nine orders him to go.
---
Time for a fucking crusade
---
The game is quick paced and standing still is a sure way to die. In and out of cover, try not to get hit. Lore wise, i dont think you are stronger than the enemy, you just have a ghost.  
---
Max resilience does boost your health, but than means maybe you can take one or two more shots. Not 50. I think max resilience only translates to like 15% more health or so. We very much do rely on our abilities. Pop your barriers and if your shield is gone,  try to recover
---
yeah its so much easier, especially when everyone on the enemy team leaves to give you that free win lmao
---
40 minutes? It took me 25ish with ransoms.
---
I got the monte carlo from ikora after the first ‚Äúarm and  a leg‚Äù challenge.
---
why do they rename gun names
---
Yeah you gotta be real careful with the character creator, what looks decent in the editor looks like... well, this, in game.
---
Ah, I remember when that was literally the 1 purpose of warlocks throughout the entire lifespan of d1
---
Thank you, but that doesn't answer my question.
---
The [resident evil merchant](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/residentevil/images/8/84/Merchant_re4.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120116022101) was a huched over dude in a hood all the way back in 2005
---
Damn I got my hopes up
---
Now do it with a sniper next :)
---
What changed apart of a new enemy?
---
Not much longer my friend. OEM is getting nerfed at the end of the month
---
LOL that amatuer one on the right looks so much like Bungie's art on the left, i'm dying!
---
Got mine in a garden world while farming lumina progress
---
Yes I have the melee mods from the artifact installed (Thunder Coil and the two from the previous row). I demolish enemies when my gloves get going, but it a lot of the time it's super clutch and I find myself frantically searching for enemies to kill so I can heal or I get almost instantly shot to hell. I also punch bosses sometimes but I've had limited success, though that is expected of course. I hope I get the helmet soon as it seems pretty good, unless I get frustrated and reroll to something more reliable.
---
I have to, because for some reason my brain dead teammates never think to actually bank the motes they have.
---
It's a bird! It's a plane! It's... random parts raining down all over the countryside.
---
I swear I‚Äôm seeing destiny references everywhere now. I saw a whole thread of destiny references on an animemes post
---
I too am surprised lmao
---
Nobody expects the destiny Inquisition !
---
*Desire to bayonet charge intensifies*
---
Legit today i got mine, 42 runs
---
Can‚Äôt wait to see your Rendition of Monty Carlton and the Holey Pale!
---
[deleted]
---
A gun we received from the simulation, so of course it comes with whatever story the Vex want you to believe.
---
\#TheParadoxIsALie
---
Well, fair enough. But it's not as if Hunter doesn't have Foetracer.
---
Its because there isnt any finesse to titan class, its just run + punch
---
What armor pieces are you using? I like this look dude
---
Don't worry the nine will take care of this fake
---
I ran strikes last week only punching with thundercoil on my striker. I'm not sure why you're having less success, as I didn't find myself close to death too often. Only thing I can think of is maybe spec into recovery some. It'll help you heal faster. Don't go all in like you have with resilience, but 40 or so will be a huge difference to what you're seeing now.
---
Nooooo that sounds miserable for everyone
---
Come back ANY time
---
Sweet. Keep all the screeching nine year olds happy, Fake Xur!
---
Damn... beat me to it
---
Not just you, it‚Äôs been happening recently to a lot of people.
---
u/Xenilla. I love you for adding star wars sound effects.
---
Ok the triangle symbol enemy is a barrier champion. Idk why they spawn in there cause I ran into a few but they are in ordeal nightfalls to provide a challenge and better loot if killed.
---
I had  non my fellow Guardian! My cloak is master worked though!
---
Yea, Since New Light, Destiny got was more popular than fartnite so they're gonna copy off it for a bit.
---
Yep, that's completely what it is. I might have skipped over the dialogue too because I don't recall seeing it in game, but that's a Vex Gate for sure.
---
When I first saw this area I got flashbacks to hiding in that area under the alter during nightfalls
---
Service Revolver, Zavala drops it if your lucky but its not the best hand cannon!
---
Accidents happen i guess? Or might have accidentally fallen into a vex portal. Or got his choice of travel broken/stuck.
---
You already became one and dont know about it.
---
Monte Carlo Lite
---
i was asking raz if his drops were good 
---
but thanks for the info anyway
---
Mountaintop too jesus christ
---
The nine never make mistakes
---
Literally my sister just spent 90 bucks yesterday?!? Wtf
---
I seen you around the tower. Greeting from gay Joseph Goebbles
---
Just so you know, since it‚Äôs a year 1 weapon it‚Äôs just a fully masterworked drop and not a curated roll, since in year 1 all the weapon rolls were static
---
As for the gun itself, it‚Äôs pretty decent still. Not the best gun, but it can get the job done
---
Nice. Looks good
---
Lag switch.
---
Monte Carlo and middle tree striker. 
---
Slam. All. The. Things.
---
I don't actually lol often, but when I do, upvotes are provided.   
---
*This was a perfect video.*
---
All the new light players have made Gambit a nightmare for me. I try and try to give tips via chat but no one reads.   We have the random blueberry running around with a 15 stack while everyone else is at the bank ready to summon. This has happened on my last 4 matches and I rarely play Gambit.
---
It's painful.
---
Every Fucking Time ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
---
You're still right so i edited and upvote you. Now as a Titan,  i'm gonna hug you.
---
That reminds me! Since its fortnite which DID have/has portals (not sure) he might have been kidnapped
---
Buy stuff off Banshee also
---
Rifts
---
Welp...This escalated quickly.
---
Meanwhile, Ikoria's "genius plan" to trick the undying mind is to kill it a ton.
---
This one tab in your inventory where you can check unlocked stuff like shaders, emblems, guns, armor for all classes, etc. , you can pull anything you already collected into your personal inventory that isn't randomly rolled, so if you got a Y1 weapon like duty bound, even if you dismantle it you cna get it back, unlike say a spare rations
---
Could be d1 too
---
I got mine with a magazine masterwork on my 3rd clear, it‚Äôs probably my new favorite auto
---
No, it was nerfed in D2 year 1 including having to 3 hit people with melee and everyone hated it.
---
Damn, Sunshot... One day i will get one :(
---
Other guardians: Did you ever stop shooting ? Like you know... Relax. 
---
Me: I can't hear you ! I'm ALWAYS shooting.  
---
ennemies: Oh no.
---
I‚Äôm 910 on PC and cofounder of our clan I‚Äôm not great at adding people but I can try!
---
I got mine in my second run of the strike
---
Crayons
---
If you have a solar weapon the captains are a non issue. Knights are only easy if you have 2 or more assist, they have so much health
---
As soon as the screen flashes red my ass has already booked it away from my team for this exact reason
---
Ghost121897 is my ign :)) would love to join a clan
---
Thermite, incendiary and spike are all 100% rng of whether or not they will actually work, as they have a tendency to just aim in whatever direction makes the least sense, in pvp fusion and magnetic grenades dont do much damage and slide off of targets often, suppressor and flashbang are good but it's hard as hell to make them hit and put them to good use, pulse grenade is the only easy and reliable one but it requires someone to stand still inside of it for its duration.
---
I'd much rather bait someone around a corner and stun them with a trap and finish them, or just smack them with the hunter solar tracking grenade
---
Titan like hugs.  And punching things in the face
---
 And... Did i mention punching ? PUNCHING.  * Sythoceps intensifies *
---
But Titans are friendly too and they love doing free hugs for everyone.
---
Oh! So that's what armor pieces are talking about when they mention collections. I'll take a look!
---
Is dark age seal bugged? Only thing keeping me from being dredgen
---
Cool we‚Äôve only got 4 members atm there should be two or three more joining soon though
---
Lol thanks for enjoying
---
I think I'm in a minority here, but I feel like the bright dust system we have is fine, I manage 3000+ bright dust a week through bounties
---
I don‚Äôt remember when I got mine but I‚Äôve done it many times with my wife (it‚Äôs her favorite Nightfall Strike) and she still doesn‚Äôt have it. I occasionally take it out of the vault when I have to get auto rifle kills for Banshee-44.
---
Me personally for all class i would want to go for high resilience, recovery, intellect, and discipline. Thats how i had my stats on d1 and im trying to mirror it on d2.
---
Ah sorry by OP in that case I meant the post/video I linked, will edit my comment just to make it clearer.
---
Sick play though, whats the roll on your Service Revolver?
---
I agree with this, running contraverse holds with charge grenade and 100 discipline is super sexy in pvp and pve
---
The Collection Tab is a tab of all the items you aquired over time. Year 1 items or Exotics or shaders or emblems or ships or Ghost Shells can be re-aquired if you deleted them. The only things you cannot re-aquire are random roll gear from Year 2z
---
How about a crucible game mod where supers and ability‚Äôs are all disabled so it‚Äôs only guns
---
I want shadowkeep :(
---
Ah I'm not very familiar with hunters' builds
---
Well you are very lucky then at most I get 1k
---
I fucking love this gun. My mate just dropped it from a 950 nightfall not half an hour ago. I told him he's going to love it. He has no choice in the matter!
---
Well yes. But normally it‚Äôs spelled Night instead of nite.
---
Yeah and there is no reset timer on the Archive page. But figured I would check if anyone knows if bungie as said anything.
---
I do see the vendor and Im item level 908, however I do not see the flashpoint: 
---
[screenshot](https://imgur.com/16eafeed-28c7-40fd-b3ce-367e83e564ac)

I mostly do Gambit haha since i love the raiding function
---
Then there is hope for your son.
---
Kills are relative if you‚Äôre going by Destiny‚Äôs tracking system since assists count as kills. Destiny tracker is more accurate but for the purpose of your question I‚Äôd consider players consistently getting over 20+ true kills a game to be above average
---
A simple way to put it. Shadow keep content is almost entirely PvE stuff.
---
https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127658/Destiny_SoU_Calendar_EN.png?cv=3983621215&amp;av=3518372230
---
That is the release schedule for content.
---
With shadow keep you have:
---
New campaign.
---
Ongoing weekly story(not huge, but some changes happen weekly, like a portal being built in the tower.
---
Nightmare hunts
---
Exotic quests
---
Vex offensive.
---
Vex invasions.
---
Shadow keep dungeon
---
Shadow keep raid.
---
2 new strikes.
---
New gear and loot.
---
* new super abilities(since you are new light, buying forsaken or shadow keep will allow you to unlock 3 new supers per character, for a total of 9 across 3 characters)
---
Anyways hope this helps. If you have further questions let me know, and if you want some direct help or questions in game, private message me your steam profile and I would be glad to add you as a friend and help you get situated.
---
This may also have some information and tips you may not know.

Then don't watch him. Easy fix. 
---
I can't stand that waste of life called Kackis, but instead of complaining about him I just don't watch the garbage he puts out there.
---
Thanks for the downvotes :D hard work pays off.. I used defender with mountaintop/recluse/truth and Crest of alpha &amp; better already on my mark. It was a pain but I conserved heavy for the boss.
---
All those pootube guys are clowns. I pay zero attention to any of them.
---
bungo store prevents you from ordering over 1000 USD of items at a time
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
*i'm sorry guardian*
---
That‚Äôs the right idea I think. There is a ton you can do for free. If you decide, you like it and want more content, then you can try the dlcs. Forsaken  is a great deal for how cheap it is and the amount of content in it
---
This only works on the rArE, bLuE qUaLiTy SpArRoWs.
---
Oh come on dont encourage him
---
*you're on*
---
Took you long enough to figure that out. Datto is a plague in the Destiny community. He berates and is less than kind to his clanmates, always looks like he needs a shower, and playstyle leaves lots to be desired. 
---
Yea I'd rather watch Gladd, Broman, Byf, Mesa or even Mtashed. 
---
Dont watch Datto's vids or like his shit. That's how we make it known.
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs too late to re upload lol
---
Lol I got mine fully Masterworked in Range on my first solo run. I love it.
---
I love it when my season pass rewards drops me another 25 of these bad boys
---
Try War cult Endgame, it's very similar to Monte Carlo's greyish white I used to rock this because I was a big time Monte Carlo user in D1. Sure would be nice to get one. Did 7 nightfalls at 950, zero exotics...
---
I believe someone in my clan says it's:
---
Volundr&gt;Gofanon&gt;Izanami&gt;Bergusia
---
I ask for sherpas for crown of sorrow because everyone I group with is dog shit. And I've made maybe 2 or 3 posts on different subs looking for a group. Stat trackers are a thing. I have nothing to prove
---
Weapons, pvp, pve, quest line etc. anything seem difficult and achievable but he makes like it‚Äôs impossible and people don‚Äôt have to do it because he said so I don‚Äôt get it. He is number 1 on YouTube for destiny contents. Which is sad this will bring a lot of negatively to the community.
---
Yeah just like how Destiny 1 ripped off the merchant from RE4, and probably a million other examples
---
Maybe its osiris?
---
That does way too much fucking damage, the Titan one is so bad now your slow as fuck and have virtually the same health as someone without it
---
There is a campaign
---
Did your friend make the hoodie himself and make his own logo on the front or back? Because of so, then it would be like other kids making the same thing and calling it their own.
---
Yes let's make fun of new light players that have been playing for the grand total of a month.
---
Sweet, thanks for the help!
---
Which feels either untrue or unenforced. One of their top current posts is a pic of an NPC standing near a ledge and the Title/Comment is ‚Äúfix this immediately Bungie it‚Äôs giving me too much anxiety.‚Äù
---
Ahhhhh yes enslaved hunter
---
They are both annoying and bring nothing of value.
---
Can you get a gun from fishing in Minecraft? But I‚Äôm not here to argue or shit on fortnight, just stating the facts they took the idea from blackout.
---
Lol relax.
---
Congrats!
---
Actually I laughed at this. Plenty of value. Trash Titian‚Äôs get easy kills with oem, plenty of value.
---
Why hasn‚Äôt this been patched yet? Wasn‚Äôt oem introduced in forsaken or something?
---
Dont speak against the hivemind, I'm surprised they haven't started banning people for anti titan hate speech
---
He also warned against the first assualt on the moon, which ended in complete disaster
---
That's fair and 100% true.
---
-10, Jesus christ ! Virgins can't take jokes lol
---
The real meta was the friends we made along the way.
---
DTG is more complaint heavy is the general consensus.  Destiny2 is more Meme‚Äôs and fun stuff.
---
omg,this fkn circlejerk of FoRtNiTe BaD SoMeTHinG gOoD is here too?i though this sub was better,and the "xur" thing is not even a skin
---
it takes 2-3 shots to kill from any range and you never reload. People dont respect the damage and just try to fight you but you will win 1v1 every single time. If they do happen to respect the damage and hide, just pop spectral and kill everything. The scorn map is kinda hard because the team can split up so many different ways but that rarely happens.
---
It does? I didn‚Äôt think it did. Thanks!
---
What‚Äôs up with the no grenade using? Or melees?
---
Woah there, Toontown was better than Fortnite
---
The Circumcised Grind
---
It shouldn‚Äôt at all, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs most annoying about it. You know you can get waaaay better but your stuck at way lower.
---
Weird you pride yourself on being toxic. Must be a sad existence.
---
Yes shit I just noticed that I wrote shadowkeep and not forsaken
---
Thats so fucking embarrassing man F
---
the campaign of destiny 2 is basicly the beginning of attack on titan
---
I belive its influenced on what you do in the game, if you kill a ton of mobs you get reaper, if you do a lot of  blocker killing its sentry ect, thats what i was told anyways
---
Its because it is a duty bound with a white shader...
---
One eyed crutch
---
I just use the best auto rifle in the game, my Dan with outlaw/rampage
---
It‚Äôs kinda hard to tell that this isn‚Äôt Monty Carlo but the way that you can tell is the yellow glow near the bottom and since it just came out this season it doesn‚Äôt have the catalyst and therefore can‚Äôt be masterworks sorry to expose you like this but I  needed to let the truth out
---
This has been addressed so many times. 
---
There won‚Äôt be.
---
Hated by non-titan mains.
---
FTFY.
---
Hunters are better in pvp. There's no argument. Titans are only the current meta cause of exotics. Take away oem and hunters regain their place as easily the best pvp class. And then every non-hunter main will bitch about them. It's been a constant cycle since D1.
---
I didn‚Äôt know it was nerfed before, I‚Äôve only come back from playing this since Curse of osiris. But it still seems too strong. Or needs a rework, not a nerf
---
Edit: i was just exploring the tower and found some cool 'out of bounds' areas and this was my favourite

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna rip that stupid shit off your face!!!! REEEEEEEEEEE!!!!‚Äù

Well first off, there's a free to play version called new light, so it's worth at least trying it out again. In general the game is in a much better place now. They added more RPG elements which makes it so you can chase some builds which can be very fun! There's lots of events and fun activities that have been added recently. Bungie us doing a much better job at keeping the player base in the loop about the decisions they are making and in general listening to community feedback and making adjustments quickly (compared to the past). Since the lest Activision they are getting to make the game they really want. I could go on and on, but I would just suggest going to YouTube and searching New Light or Shadowkeep.
---
Did you play before shadowkeep, bottom tree striker was too strong
---
Did 4 matches this morning and every one of them was unwinnably one sided. Whatever they changed for matchmaking actually made it worse than it used to be.
---
Duty Bound is such a wonderful weapon. It took so long to grind for that bastard... That nightfall is just so tedious.
---
I was aswell
---
Didn‚Äôt know it had one I don‚Äôt have the gun
---
The Calus Treasured shader i think, from Leviathan
---
Smooth criminal
---
I‚Äôm not talking bows in general, I like bows too, it‚Äôs just that Wish Ender isn‚Äôt really a good weapon but it‚Äôs a tool for the eggs. The forge bow is a better kinetic bow and monarch is a better exotic bow.
---
No...... YOU'RE BREATHTAKING!!!
---
That would be very interesting to see. Only thing I think would come close to the feel of it would be the Eternal Warrior helmet, which I do like the look of.
---
Not gonna lie, if you remove the fortnight watermark, that xur render is actually legit.
---
Yeah you just have to do the quest for it I think.
---
Anecdotally, I was just helping a new player who didn't understand that you had to manually apply mods.
---
I‚Äôm going to say in most cases general laziness, some cases people not realising and others just don‚Äôt care or spent their mod points randomly.
---
Same, I have been grinding for it and still nothing
---
Finally someone said it lol it‚Äôs all we have üò£
---
Preach. Especially frustrating when they just say ‚ÄúI have Erinas vow/Levi breath‚Äù. I mean sure those work but do you not have anything else?
---
I always keep one for each encounter in case my team doesn‚Äôt have it.
---
Okay so we at least know that the game is using your actual GPU now, so that is good. Disregard the display port question, I once again forgot that you're on a laptop. Don't IT while high. Is your laptop overheating/getting too hot?
---
How to fix PVP:
---
‚Ä¢Does it make the user harder to kill?  
---
‚Ä¢Does it kill on a single hit?  
---
‚Ä¢Does it track automatically?  
---
‚Ä¢Does it in any other way reduce the skill required to play at a certain level?  
---
Remove it.
---
Yours, not mine
---
&gt;Now that autos are slightly better
---
"Now" ?
---
It's supposed to be the lighting's effects on the contours of his face, perhaps I could have been more subtle with it
---
they are using the emblem that shows how much glory they have. lus most of the people i play up against have unbroken.
---
Cayde 6 is dead
---
New Age Black Armory = best shader
---
Yeah lol I‚Äôm just giving you a hard time. I agree with what you are saying
---
Yees, it is pretty great
---
Not me but... I haven‚Äôt gotten mine yet either!
---
Yes i know but every walkthrough says i need to start the patrol with his mission, but we already have access to the patrols without doing it, yet it wouldnt count
---
What console?
---
Ps4
---
Forsaken. Hands down.
---
Woah this looks amazing def one of the coolest I've seen so far
---
Damn I‚Äôm on Xbox

If you dont use OEM you're fine. If you do, come take your trash talk like a man

I didn't know you could get the full Monty in D2
---
Light does jack shit in Crucible, so it's their skill and their weapons that's fucking you. Try running a rapid fire pulse or your favourite exotic weapon and focus on team shots and disengaging when you're low.
---
I want to do raids, but I only have one friend that playa destiny, and we dont live in the same timezone
---
First of all fam, I just described you why people do that, haven't said I am doing this myself (I am part of clan of highly competitive people, so I get bits and pieces here and there about these things. That's why ik it works everytime since we have a channel full of salty messages from people like you) since I find it petty to do so or to even care someone is doing it to me. If that itself triggers you and makes you salty, then you picked the right name. Moreover, you are the one here being unironically upset that someone is spamming its virtual crotch on your face in a video game. I mean, if that gets under your skin, wonder how you can cope with serious problems irl. You sound like a wet dream of any t-bagger ngl.

All the year one armor is obtainable as far as 8 know, and it will have year 3 rolls.
---
¬øPor qu√© no los dos?

hol up, I never noticed the circles on the Traveler, it makes it look like &gt;!the artifact from the end of the Shadowkeep campaign!&lt;
---
Which one is it?
---
I used to love D1 monte carlo with gambler‚Äôs dagger and double throwing knife. It was equivalent to nothing manacles with all the energy drain perks on
---
Tell that to bungie. Why even show at all then
---
just go play Red War, you will see.  Two missions are all you need to love Cayde
---
Trials, it‚Äôs unobtainable now.
---
Congrats, you played yourself
---
It rotates now, this question has been asked and answered nearly a thousand times on this subreddit after the update. Try searching the subreddit and finding out information on the forges or use a little thing I call google search.
---
Bruh moment
---
Aw :(
---
Its from trials of the nine, which i think they stopped completely in season 2, it has the prestige ornament from getting flawless
---
The one from trials of the nine, with the prestige ornament

Yeah BB literally hits you around corners. I've gotten kills with it where people literally dodged around a corner and were not visible anymore.
---
It's the black armoury alanta d remake, it's usually not that good but I got a good roll
---
All right, ill check it out
---
I know buddy, it‚Äôs a bummer :(
---
Pun not intended
---
The helmet reminds me of sesame street man
---
Wuhh?
---
Yeah, unfortunately even if you have everything from one category (weapons or armor), you can still get a duplicate. The fated engram has a chance to drop weapons or armor iirc, then it looks for something you don't have. If it drops armor, but all you're missing is a weapon, then it'll drop a duplicate. At least that's how it was when he was around y1 times.
---
It's in the audio settings.... Like every other game
---
You can run any 3 patrols, the thing is, I‚Äôm not sure if you need to have a party member who‚Äôs equipped with a rat king, either that, or you have to so patrols on Titan.
---
[removed]
---
Lol dude I once experienced match like that. I was playing Freelance and some guy from my team t-bagged someone from enemy team. Then they proceed to t-bag each other and soon enough everyone was t-bagging everyone. I was just spamming that popcorn emote since it was funny af.
---
Was just about to say this. I started up EP to work on the Sunshot catalyst and ended up finishing the whole thing with some randoms that decided to help.

As the others said, it rotates, bottom left corner on the EDZ map.

The last key is bugged, so you can only do the top three ones until tuesday (29/10) patch.

is it still possible to get to the other forges even like this?

Gonna take two guesses. Have you completed Enemy of my Enemy on Titan and/or did you have at least one other party member with the rat King item in their inventory while doing the patrols
---
$46 for a shirt? Jeeeeeez

He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.

Go back into d1, all supers were a shotgun and melee away from death. This is still stronger than they were back then. I think you should really think before you post ignorance like this
---
I would, but the other day I ran menagerie and a guy was havin fun in chat. It was worth having it open for that
---
Someone get some makeup remover for that clown with the bottom tree tether hahahah
---
As far as I know it has mp. Would be quite surprising if not.
---
If you want to see the much more toxic side of the fan base then sure. 
---
But if you don‚Äôt want to be downvoted into oblivion just for saying something positive on the sub, then I recommend sticking to this sub.
---
Wow, you must be a detective to figure that out!

Thanks, I just needed ways of getting Machine Guns. I haven't gotten to the part of the season pass for that yet so I didn't realize, I'll just farm for the Memorial.
---
It does, then there is a reason for it. If at first glance, it doesn‚Äôt look like cheating, then nothing happens. If at first glance, one guy curbstomps an entire team, then it does something.
---
Discussions? It is full of stupid demands and complaints about how game should be. They dont think about the developing phase. They just demand and demand...
---
Sweet business w/ actium = almost never having to reload. You can just start spinning up behind a cover &amp; shred people if they dare to peek.

Fortnite bad give upvote
---
I bought the maroon one, such a great design, I bought it over the Moments of Triumph shirt even.
---
It goes down to 20 bucks tho, still doesnt correct the mistake on it
---
well god damn.
---
I hear yea.
---
For the record, tbagging is a valid tool in destiny. Specifically when someone is being too cocky. 
---
For example, an OEM Titan with a shotgun and shouldercharge running around punching and shooting nonstop the entire match. They deserve to be tbagged on death without question.
---
Bergusia Forge with riskrunner üíô
---
Just saying it's a hitscan ranged weapon doesn't prove anything. 
---
It's pretty much only useful in trying to get multikills against people who aren't really aware of your presence. Not to mention most solar Hunter abilities suck, and getting 2-4, maybe 5 kills depending on your luck and whether you're using top or bottom tree isn't worth putting up with the trash neutral game. Especially when it sucks at putting down supers, and something as simple as a Titan barricade can tank 1 or 2 shots.
---
How many people use something doesn't necessarily tell the whole story, but there's a reason most Hunters run arc or void in PvP.
---
Oh absolutely! I wouldn‚Äôt be that daft. It‚Äôll most likely just be sent back to Bungie for them to deal with
---
RNGesus blesses you.
---
Its both at this point.
---
Alright, thanks. That platform has been on my tower-climbing bucket list for a while
---
10 hours my longest was only 4 ish hours with 3 being spent on phase 2 of gahlran, Ican‚Äôt imagine 10.

I ran Cerberus with Actium and it was decent but it felt kinda wasteful with the artifact mod of enhanced reload only costing one.
---
Google it. There‚Äôs good guides

As a hunter who also cross dresses as a titan when my raid team has too much Hunter, I also support this

I‚Äôm fairly sure you can be circumcised and still get the ace of spades

And here? "hEy lOok I just Got ThE reCluse, heY look I juSt FouNd thIs BuG hEy lOOk i mAdE a ShitTy mEme, ArEnt wE sO muCh betTeR thAn DTG???" DTG has problems. Quite a few. I won't deny it. Currently, it's also a shithole. But this sub is not better than DTG. There are some incredibly lazy and shitty posts here, and there are whiny fuckwads at DTG, but here's the thing. Who only uses one? Just sub to both!
---
Hoho, then come as close as you'd like
---
Only thing titan has for PvP is dunemarchers
---
sadly, it does not if you're coming from console ;(
---
Well not really. In 980 nightfall its ammo just goes poof. And you are left with no primary.
---
If you didn't get the quest last season your kinda fucked
---
I tried but there are many locations and if it relocates every hour I don't know if I have enough time
---
Or a multiplayer emote
---
Ikora only, which is useless shit basically
---
Celestial Nighthawk either from Xur or random drop, same as Thunderlord (assuming you meant that as heavy weapon), Thorn from Exotic Quest,  Waking Vigil from Menagerie or Dreaming city. Cloak &amp; boots are random legendary drops, chest i dont remember, but the gloves cant be obtained(?) anymore, since they were rewarded in a holiday event in the past.
---
Yes, can confirm
---
Thanks, is it a guaranteed drop?

If I'm correct the QP or classic mix, is still connection based and not elo based. Based on the influx of new players you're going to get people who have no clue what to do. I usually hangout in the solo comp list since it has skill base matches. QP is for fun and people just want to jump in and play, it would take much longer to skill base a game of 12.
---
You can also reset the Valor ranks when you cap out so Valor really has no implications on your match making.
---
Not much longer. When vex invades tower she will be first to die.
---
Not sure but i think so, i got it on my first completion.
---
I'm surprised there are still so many hunters left, what with so many of them going to Fortnite and all.
---
So I was part of the original group that started my clan. As dumb as it sounds how does one even clan hop? Just do Strikes, turn on voice and be like.. y'all clans looking for a magic lad?
---
That was the last one I read. It's nice but I dont like the ending.
---
Did anyone else hear the raid wipe sound? Or just me?
---
My videoing skills suck btw
---
Speaking of which wtf do I do with these baryon boughs?  I have over 1000 and can‚Äôt find where to spend them.
---
I got a bunch of guilt associated with this ol' girl.  My angelic fireteam helped me farm this for hours and hours, and a short time later Forsaken dropped and it was obsolete.

No one used game chat for some reason, I would recommend using r/destinyclanfinder

That sounds like a pretty nice idea I might hop on that boat!

This is a game I played just this minute. Come on, this is absolutely ridiculous. This is EVERY GAME lol.

I love when people pretend a shooter with lock on and radar requires skill.

yeh i need to get some friends to play with there are discord or forum to find people?

I never said anything about Titans needing exotics to compete. Only that hunters are the best pvp class. Mobility is the single most important factor in pvp, they have it in spades. Something has come along that challenges hunters place at the top and everyone is angry. I don't have it and it's almost never used against me. So the outrage I see is suspicious. Metas are cyclical.

How much is for the hunter necklaces
---
You can by tinctures of queens foil and stuff, also banshee sometimes sells the infusion material with byron boughs
---
It's certainly merch... The method you use to make it is irrelevant. It's icons they designed. Fan made art is fine, but selling it crosses a legal boundary. You might want to look into this before you get a cease and desist.

---
I DON‚ÄôT GIVE A SHIT!
---
Yeah man wear what you want don‚Äôt let posts like this discourage you from trying every aspect of the game out. Warlocks and hunters both have strong points and one eyed mask is one of the Titans strongest exotic pieces. People constantly complain on both sides it‚Äôs inevitable with a pvp game. Just play how you want and heck em all.
---
Thx!!
---
Damn assgoles...
---
Sigh.... this is why no one can have fun in destiny. I‚Äôm all for nerfing and reworking blatantly op/broken shit but not to the extent some of the destiny cry babies do.
---
Also, I don‚Äôt give 2 fucks about PvP. That shit honestly needs to be on the back burner more than it already is.
---
It‚Äôs just a lost sector
---
Uhh..... he went to... umm... the Cosmodrone... yeah....

You make it a point to say people who don't agree with you either haven't read the lore or don't care, but you yourself have just incorrectly summarized at least two parts of it.
---
Mara didn't try to steal Oryx's throne world and fail. I mean, you do understand that she already had a throne world via Riven before Oryx arrived right? Why would she want/need two? Plus, Mara herself explains *in the lore* that her plan was to get taken into Oryx's throne world, steal something, wait, and break out. Here is the excerpt that you appear to have completely missed/didn't understand:
---
 *It is, on that level, a very simple bank heist:* ***Get yourself taken into the treasury as treasure, and when the owner dies, break back out with his stuff.***
---
So no, she wasn‚Äôt trying to steal the entire bank. Just the stuff inside. And if you read the reverie dawn lore, Mara reveals she indeed succeeded and got what she needed from Oryx. Again, see this exerpt from the lore:
---
*She steps through the ruins. In the end, there is nothing. Nothing but Mara Sov and the howling of rampant, untamed logics.*  
---
***Her great and terrible gamble has paid off.***  
---
*The rest is up to her now.*
---
 It's never revealed what, but a popular theory going around is that she stole the tablets of ruin (the things that gave Oryx the power to take).
---
So please, fact-check yourself and make sure what you are saying is correct before you summarize the lore for people.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure this is photoshop. In the picture there is at least 4,400 Mind Components. If this person plays ONLY Vex Offensive, not counting queue times, he would have to get about 22 mind components per hour, consistently.
---
I think guardians dont at all and as we know they can't die unless their ghost is killed but I think everytime they die they do still take a bit of wear and tear as seen with older quardians saying things like the drifter mentioning starvation.

So basically no they don't age and are in their prime

---
Is that just shards of galanor you're running? Or do you have some mods too to help get it back?
---
That‚Äôs just a place everyone knows about, the game is gorgeous if you stop and look.

May be dumb but have you tabbed down to the appearance page while inspecting your gauntlets?

When I was working on Randy's I saw a few Sweet Businessmen and honestly they were never remotely a problem.  And this was when I was done with scout rifle kills and was using Cerberus to make the grind more fun, so I would have been a prime target for them.  Maybe the ones I fought just weren't great, but the impression I got was that it was more of a novelty build.

Straight facts

That‚Äôs pretty dope ngl

Maybe fun, but useful?? Nahhhhh
