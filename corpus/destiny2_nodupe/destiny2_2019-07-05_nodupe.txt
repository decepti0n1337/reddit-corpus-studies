Huh. Idk about crucible, and I don‚Äôt know what happened there, but in PvE it happens when you go in a new area.

nope but if the enemy kills adds and they dont get to pick up the motes, you can take them.

wow ya sure got him

My friend preordered Anthem when I said he should wait till the open beta. He told me later he regretted the purchase.
---
I somehow completely went over that he was talking about revoker and not recluse. My bad.

YES.

‚ÄúI just forgot to take Nighthawk off...‚Äù

Hitting that crisp damage cap is one of the most satisfying things ever.

Especially like on a random dreg who was just minding its own business.

One time we did Spire prestige and a guy not only didn't listen to any command, ignoring when we called to step on signs and literally ran off with the ball when we started juggling since no one knew how to do the bug correctly, thenwhen we complained he would go like "i know what i'm doing"... the leader kicked him out and we did on the second try (the first failed because of that bug when the ball pass through the ship without destroying it) with another random

My advice? Get a good-rolled Kindled Orchid and wait for Iron Banner. I was able to make a LOT of progress that week, even as a mediocre PvP player.
---
You gotta go down those beams on the side. Its really fun
---
You got that from google
---
Straight from google photos on the iPhone
---
I spent 97 shards on that last week &amp; initially thought I had gotten burned by getting that. I'm starting to like it a bit, especially after the catalyst for it dropped in the middle of a fist-fight in the EDZ!

The endgame is dry as hell I can‚Äôt even try to deny that, but the lack of dev talk is straight bullshit. They‚Äôre literally doing a PTS for a huge upcoming event and post updates on it like weekly. All the people saying there‚Äôs no dev communication are just repeating what they heard some toxic YouTuber makeup for clickbait.
---
modnight coup is still fantastic for pve, a well rolled trust is good too. Ace and malfeasance aren‚Äôt bad, but a masterworked legendary hc would be better to make orbs since you‚Äôll be using your hand cannon to clear ads mostly. 
---
I‚Äôve been running middle tree gunslinger near exclusively since forsaken dropped, and I‚Äôm gonna say it‚Äôs still really good despite the nerf to shards. Blade barrage is still great, and a well aimed super with shards on will still get you back 50%. It‚Äôs the impact of the knives from the super that determine how much super energy you‚Äôre going to get back, so make sure you hit all the knives you throw. 
---
Regarding the arc subclass, it‚Äôs always been good, but i wouldn‚Äôt say the best. Use whatever suits your playstyle!
---
Please, please just let it die...

&gt;Hahahhahahahahha you cant do anything this is my domain

Wrong. You're in **MY** house now.

Run along now.

I laughed

Fair enough, I don't really follow what's going on so I could be wrong with all I know. I'm glad you are able to get some fun out of it definitely.

Happened to me back in last wish, where one guy just couldn‚Äôt grasp the concept of jumping on a plate or use high Dps to kill the boss, ends up leaving cuz of ‚Äúshort on time‚Äù, second guy came in and cleared it in first try

I had a guy that were literally recording the whole raid just so he can rewatch and yell at whoever screw up the most, he got kicked from the clan from being too abusive lol
---
Raid Banner too smh
---
Mmm, bouncy knights.
---
Yeah that happened to my team last night.
---
To do what?
---
Until I miss.
---
yeah which is why i go the mute myself route since i don‚Äôt need the fireteam hearing any annoying background noise
---
No! ... Yeah!
---
I pre ordered Fallout 76, never again
---
Though fun fact: If you punch the enemy as its stomping you wont get launched back so you can keep beatin that yellow boy with that shotty
---
Oh gosh. Ive only done two. Volundr and the one that starts with a b i think. Somewhere south on the map. I assume this is all for shields?
---
Make one of each and play all 3.
---
But I‚Äôd say freshening up your loadout a bit isn‚Äôt a bad thing. It‚Äôs not like if you don‚Äôt use your normal gun you won‚Äôt be able to do things. I would also think that using the same thing over and over again gets a bit boring.
---
Imagine being stuck in a horror game esque house with something like that. Not being able to escape. But not being able to die either.
---
I finished it on that map too! God that brings back the feels. Camping on top of the truck with my Word of Crota.
---
Ive bough maybe one dlc in only a couple of games. Most notably, black ops 3. Destiny 2 actually made me want the season pass
---
"That boss"
---
You mean ***every*** boss.
---
Same exact boat as you
---
Last Man Standing from Prime/Reckoning can roll with it. I don't know about any other
---
Yeah it's the comics or something. Darth Vader wanted to Lure the rebels in so he directed Storm troopers to miss the important targets and drive them to certain locations. Meanwhile (now in the movie) there's a tracking beacon on the millennium falcon and they let them escape to the rebel base so they could find it. 
---
Previously, on tatooine Obi-wan remarks how accurate and deadly storm troopers are. And after, they nearly win every single engagement. Stormtroopers are badasses. They just get a bad rep from a meme.
---
All I can ever see is Magicarp in that Warlock helmet.
---
Dust rock blues is probably the best pvp option and can be farmed easily through menagarie. I would go with slideshot and snapshot or something like that. 
---
In pvp grenade launchers with spike grenades are really good for dps. Prospector is really good.
---
Makes sense, thank you. 
---
What about the purple gear with the exotic boarder around it?
---
Wait, who's Garry
---
We were literally incapable of killing the man. He soaked up so much light that he shed his mortal vessel and turned into literally a creature made of pure light, and was such a legitimate threat that the traveler decided to wake up after however many hundred years to sit his ass back down. He wasn‚Äôt a cake walk, he was just actually such a fucking tank that they couldn‚Äôt even let us fight him because he would have molly whopped the light right off your scrawny ass and popped your ghost like a fucking zit
---
It's just you bud
---
The only raid you can't do is CoS.
---
You can do the power surge bounties to get 690 gear FYI
---
Only if you rarely use tractor. 
---
I did it first week like a day in only because it was by accident and my tractor &gt; any Minotard lol
---
Ah that makes sense, there's no MMR that balances team. Is it like that in competitive or does it have something to actually make the play mode skill based?
---
If you're not good like me just run cheese shit and you'll get 2100 in no time. Destiny pvp is absolute shit but you gotta suffer a bit to get the good stuff
---
Louis be lookin thicc
---
Idk I kinda pooped my pants with all those LoW
---
I wasn‚Äôt aware people did this. In all the menageries I‚Äôve run through literally never seen teams bail (especially on cake modifiers) on it. Me and my son were with Randos and both rocking luminas and wow. The damage buff is. Pleasant
---
punch with code of the commander. see what happens.
---
Email me your moms number and let‚Äôs find out
---
Got that in WoW all the fucking time and fucks sake does it get old. 
---
Was in a guild for a while that was fun, but shit was fucked, and there was a solid raid team there that was being held back by the GM and whoever his buddies/who he wanted to bang were, constantly needing to drag people along. One day we just all left, went and made our own guild and got our shit straight. Within 2 weeks, we went from #52 on the server group to #12 in terms of raid progression.

It's fucking insane how bad dead weight pulls you down.

What are all noobs going to do when that gun get nerfed? Quit the game?

After over a  year I just got my EP shotgun and you bet your sweet ass I treated like it was a y1 version and just got in everything's face with it! Blackout on reposte pfff eat my barrel you damn Ogre!

outrun a ranged super with tracking projectiles yeah sure bud

use celestial GG headshot in a well, empowered on a target hit by melting point to trigger a power outage in their area
---
not what i'm saying i'm saying people should stop acting lie it's a titan thing
---
its a term you're overthinking it
---
Yeah I like it for the health regen in PVE, I keep it on at all times
---
It is though. So very, very haunted.

ah yes the ignorance one eyed mask doesnt insta heal and shield if they are shot they barely get half

where did you get fusions arent powerful from

And Mindbender

except melting point is worse than boop cannon

9.99 million of them just play PvE

No no still need more and maybe even a heavy one too /s
---
I love doing this.
---
The rain is so dreary but the ruined inner city is beautiful. Too bad I have no reason to go in there 90% of the time
---
But that max damage isn‚Äôt possible without well and melting point.  So really nighthawks are just being propped up by warlocks and titans.
---
I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre being downvoted, plenty of players struggle to find others to play with.
---
I know how hard it can be waiting for a long time to get someone to play together from a LFG site or from Reddit. It‚Äôs like pulling teeth in my experience. I‚Äôm fortunate to have a friend who plays now but LFG sites can be a mess when you‚Äôre new. 
---
Most players want high level guardians who know everything before they join up.
---
What helmet is that on the warlock
---
Wait fuck yes, I live in fear always anyway so mwhahahah, I would probably have fun

I'm just saying, you should definitely give it the final rest it deserves once Shadowkeep comes out.

Hit em with that boot en block

since we are already talking about it , do you think that Y1 content became free because it wasn't that good?
---
Good job on the title, I feel like it was most of the reason why I laughed!
---
With Captain America and Tethers btw.
---
i enjoy doing raids with first timers it lets me get better at the raids without having to worry about being yelled at i watch the videos but they are not as good as doing the raid and having it explained have done multiple leviathan and spire raids have not done as may sotp and last wish as should do
---
They will not fix an activity from a previous season, I'm afraid.

i find hunter jump really annoying good luck me doing a petas run on hunter

Imperial decree? Was that its name?

It's going to take you MUCH longer than an hour of farming. Don't get discouraged.

###OF COURSE
---
personally i would take all you cruci wannabes and lock you in your own game for ever . you noddys are responsible for every weapon/super nerf there has ever been , and we on the p v e side just have to sit and watch as our weapons decrease in power. please stop whining your killing us.
---
Not if you get knocked slightly off angle and smash your skull onto a pillar and watch as your body plops beside your teammates as they continue doing dps and ignore you
---
Why tho. What do you use?
---
Well alrighty looks like I have a few things in my pursuits I need to check out to see if they start it.

Oh shid I can‚Äôt read

I dont even use mine....

Let's see you reach that without help from a warlock damage boost.
---
Reaper/Sentinel for life
---
??? Dont know where youve been. Getting away from them has never been a problem for me. Not  that they dont kill me sometimes but not nearly as much as all the  titans going thor mode and 1 punch kills.
---
Please provide one clip where a hunter dodges your handheld supernova in melee range because I call bs :P
---
I feel exactly the same as you. Before Forsaken I've played D2 on a daily basis for 1-2 hours. Now I have little to no free time, I'm busy plus I have other hobbies. The grind is awful long, stretched and not rewarding, I preferred vanilla D2 to this grind. Developers made it clear they cater to people who don't have jobs and play only one game all the time, that honestly sickens me, because they create new content specifically for them and I am being locked away from said content (competitive, annoying hard strikes that are very hard to complete solo) because I have way less time than they do. I don't mind raids and so on, but since Opulence 90% of the content is clearly designed to either A - people with no jobs and a ton of free time, or B - people with a ton of free time and friends that also don't do nothing all day.
---
Not to mention constant problems with gatelocked content being meta or time locked, or that netcode sucks for PvP or harder PvE.
---
I really like how the game plays, supers and so on, but in order to make actual progress, I have to spend hours, whilist the progress is either minimal (prime engrams) or huge (meta gatelocked gun)  which I'm not fond of at all, especially as I play at odd hours (school hours) so there are no people (kids) to team up to do gated content.
---
Thanks, but I have a life to live, I'm done with your games.
---
Already have forsaken, thank you!
---
It's still kind of broken, but much more of a game now
---
Thanks!

Its always been broken for me

Hope you have your ghost close by when you eat that

For the shotgun make sure the first perk is either rifled barrel or field choke and the second you want to be accurized rounds. This should give u the max range possible which is super important for pvp
---
YEET
---
Ada has 2 sets of bounties: dailies &amp; weeklies.
---
Weeklies: one asks you to complete forges (2 completions), the other one to complete daily bounties.
---
Upon completing a weekly bounty, you get a schematic that let you choose 1 powerful frame. Note that each forge has a set of weapons, you need all forges unlocked to forge all possible frames.
---
Those are POWERFUL frames, so increase in power level.
---
Dailies: those bounties are needed for the second weekly bounty, which will give you your second powerful frame access.
---
Upon completing 2 powerful frames in a week, you get a powerful armor item (BA armor set).
---
You'll notice non powerful frames to forge as well. You'll need an item to buy those that you get from completing forges.
---
Additionally: there are 3 exotics to earn through Black Armory forges. 2 of them are "random" drops in certain circumstances. The 3rd one is a quest. I won't spoil you more than that.
---
My "favorite" is when I throw the occasional defective Slowva bomb that just flies straight through a pack of enemies and doesn't explode or track.
---
-cont for OP- And if you have all the forges unlocked on 3 characters that basically means 6 powerful frame bounties per week and possibly a slight change for jotunn on bergusia forge.
---
I run shotguns and hand cannons, so I usually wipe the ads and let my team pick them up.
---
Depends on what you want to cross. You wouldn‚Äôt have access to the story missions on the slave platform.
---
Imperial decree and mindbenders ambition are two basically equal picks, in kinetic and energy slot respectively. Imperial decree you get from the menagerie the new 6-man matchmade activity. The mindbender you can farm from the Hollowed lair nightfall which just so happens to be this week. Go get them, guardian
---
Yes
---
Hit Dul Incarnu with a Peregrine Greave melting point (all 3 knights down), max D on a melee
---
Oh :(
---
Using your perks/mods wrong. Yeah titan spamming shoulder charge is annoying. And one set of leg armour does boost sprint. But if i ignore regen in my armor for pvp (im either dead or they are and ill have time to regen anyway) i can have pretty good resilience and good mobility just from perk options and mod slots. Plus frost or stompees make a hunter dart all over the map. Its no nice. My titan, though strong, was just so slow when i switched back.
---
Oh man the vaping drives me nuts. I have a buddy who does it and swears he's putting the mic up but there's no fucking way he is. It's so goddamn loud.

haha it's even better with 1-2 punch, standing just far enough away from the well placed well that no one will come res you

Think youd get 80 at that rank but not sure

Ok so they nerf hammerhead, then truth is OP, so they nerf truth, then throne is op, so they nerf thorn. I wound rather have hammerhead stay because I know they're coming and I have a hammerhead too.

Getting kills with the bottom tree I think extends the duration

‚ÄúWho said Warlocks were better with books than guns? Okay! It was me... Rage is an excellent motivator!‚Äù

Time to invest in tracking
---
Yeah, my bad, I shouldn't have expected basic human decency from you lol.
---
r/woooosh
---
Petra would be the cool stepsis
---
Recluse is a pretty big outlier to make a blanket statement like that. Get the perk going and it competes with special weapon damage. 
---
Double primaries with normal primaries are not as much fun. I didn‚Äôt mind it in year 1 as much as many people did but we are so much stronger now than we ever were in year 1. It‚Äôs pretty insane honestly.
---
Ah, the beauty of tracking rockets...
---
Rip rocket dreams
---
And youre the one spamming clickbait. Foh Yammering about how "theyre six stacking by manipulating the world wide web!" And then turning around, going on a huge rant about "chill dude im not stupid. I just word things stupidly for attention." Thats how you sound. Just take your crucible L and leave. We all been there
---
what?
---
After 6 months and never even opening a second super on my warlock I just gave up and started double maiming hunters and a spare titan for the jumpz.
---
It's all good. Everyone makes mistakes, and it's super nice of you to admit that. Just like how maybe it's an honest mistake and not a malicious middle finger to gamers. Hot take, I know.

Devs don't come to this sub, see the sub rules (#1 specifically).

In the recent vidoc, they did specify that they would be working on Crucible in Year 3 after they finish up some of the stuff they are working on.

I felt that pain.
---
It‚Äôs because when you obtain lumina, rose gets dissolved. You then pull rose out of your collections, it gains a nod slot, and a range masterwork that has to be unlocked.
---
No you‚Äôre breathtaking!
---
Moon‚Äòs haunted
---
Explains why that happened
---
WHAT?!
---
What I'm asking is that a still a heavy weapon slot "machine gun" as classified in game or are they adding machine guns to different slots?
---
I believe Mars
---
While that may be the case, and I thank you for the advice, We shouldn't have to upgrade anything on top of spending money to buy Destiny to fix what Bungie did to the load times. Ui issues should be on them not us.
---
üòÇ
---
0/3, fuck that thing.
---
I could use graviton
---
It will be a heavy. The only none heavy macheen goon is the sweet business technically.
---
Sentry gang
---
I doubt it bad juju is rumored to be next starting somewhere during solstice. My guess is it could be a exotic quest during shadow keep like with Lumina.
---
I've done that for a friend. For the thorn quest actually. Two of us were high enough, one couldn't do damage at all. It was frustrating but fun at the same time.
---
There was an update that fixed it before Forsaken, and then they ruined it again.
---
"tusks"
---
It‚Äôs been confirmed already that the exotic getting revealed is part of Shadowkeep
---
Probably a new exotic lmg coming with shadow keep. Looks dope as hell.
---
ooh you did a lot of unnecessary digging for a 10 day old comment didn‚Äôt ya? did i really hurt you that much?
---
I think I vaguely remember that period of time. Bah.
---
So basically op just wants everyone to circle jerk to death.
---
Worth noting I did also upgrade my internet package, but even so, I noticed the fast load times are the same with the SSD. The HDD load times were just insufferable, even on a fast connection.
---
Not this again!
---
From what i understand they will bring back year one armors in shadow keep,  i know that eververse armors are comming back as ornaments to any shadowkeep armors,  and we did see y1 armors in the trailer.  So i guess they are bringing them back.
---
Sorry, #I'M HAUNTED
---
Izanagi's burden
---
Also yesterday was the 4th so most bungie employees were probably off.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs a cool story man, I‚Äôve been playing since release, so I figured I needed something for it haha
---
Clamoring for random invader span points and getting wiped out cause they ONLY want lumina.  Even if they suck. Then invading to "return the favor" or somw shite.  So the rest of us struggle to use the game for its intended purpose. ACTUALLY PLAYING.
---
It's hard to tell what you've done in this game?
---
Errrrrr. Maybe if you can't read very well. Sometimes things are in odd places but everything is there if you know where to look.
---
you can also check out the D2 LFG Discord, its very comprehensive and actively used by thousands of players. I have no problem quickly finding spots for raids/nightfalls/exotic quests etc
---
&gt;it‚Äôs hard to tell what fuck you‚Äôve done in this game. 
---
Open the director (map) and look at the tab at the top called "pursuits." It's not that hard once you know that this exists.
---
I have it on my retold tale, perfect for quick reloads after a skirmish, all it takes is crouching, great perk
---
*said in nasa employee voice* ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
---
Just one of those days, feeling like a freight train
---
lets be honest, Titan is a PvP class :P
---
Fuck off asshole
---
Made with Snapchat.... my kinda guy
---
Tractor cannon makes affected enemies take 33% more non-void damage and 50% void damage. 
---
Nova bomb itself wasn't affected, what was nerfed was the exotic helmet Skull of Dire Ahamkara.
---
I had someone like that in the enemy team yesterday. I was tempted to ask if I could join the carry to recluse. Lol
---
#MUCH MORE THAN THE OTHER TYPES
---
Exotic handcannon?! &gt;:3c
---
Oh dear Lord
---
If you ignore oem what makes titans op? I‚Äôm curious because hunters have the best movement and neutral game with out a doubt but yet it‚Äôs mainly hunters complaining about titans.
---
Any recommendations on a good one?
---
Shaxx is everyones dad
---
Also before games would use your preferred installed location. But since a recent (preview) update for me on Xbox, it uses internal if it finds it on both, regardless of preferred location. So only keep it on your external.

Dammit, u/SamDiskwelder !

Only thing I can tell you then is to maybe tweet at Bungie help or maybe dmg or cosmo and see if you get a response

problem is a "great sidearm" is still only mediocre compared to Hand Cannons or Pulse Rifles, which are essential the S tier of primary ammo weapons

I actually feel bad

are you me? I really want Recluse but not sure I am willing to put up with the pain of getting it.

Fusion charge time and minotaur teleports keep better time than the kid from whiplash

Now all you need is the Recluse

Didnt pre order but i did buy anthem. Such a waste of potential! Maps were ganna be cool. Lots of exploring. Buuuuuuut yeah no. Fuck
---
You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there. 
---
Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy. If they hadn‚Äôt been looking for you, I could‚Äôve stolen that horse and be halfway to Hammerfell. You there. You and me - we shouldn‚Äôt be here. It‚Äôs these Stormcloaks the Empire wants. 
---
We‚Äôre all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief.

Shut up back there!

And what‚Äôs wrong with him, huh?

Watch your tongue. You‚Äôre speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King.

Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You‚Äôre the leader of the rebellion. But if they‚Äôve captured you... Oh gods, where are they taking us?

I don‚Äôt know where we‚Äôre going, but Sovngarde awaits. 
---
No, this can‚Äôt be happening. This isn‚Äôt happening. 
---
Hey, what village are you from, horse thief? 
---
Why do you care? 
---
A Nord‚Äôs last thoughts should be of home. 
---
Rorikstead. I‚Äôm... I‚Äôm from Rorikstead.  
---
...looks like the Thalmor are with him.  
---
General Tullius, sir. The headsman is waiting. 
---
Good. Let‚Äôs get this over with! 
---
Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me. 
---
Look at him. General Tullius the Military Governor. And it looks like the Thalmor are with him. Damn elves. I bet they had something to do with this.  
---
Why are we stopping? 
---
Why do you think? End of the line. Let‚Äôs go. Shouldn‚Äôt keep the gods waiting for us.
---
I worry for the future of them. But as of now, I‚Äôm a great spot:)
---
Unless you are a potato. You can trust this post for I am a pvp potato.
---
Bottom tree striker is dumb,makes the super last as long as pre-bug fix spectral blades,it's also a 2 in 1 (shutdown + roaming) and the class has a good easy to use neutral
---
ANTHEM BAD
---
Im whining as a warlock,my friend whines as a titan,it's not JUST hunters
---
Looks like someone should have used a Hakke! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ *insert canned laughter here*
---
Potato gonna Potate
---
Glad to help, I noticed the difference pretty much immediately.
---
So when I got it,  I actually just slayed everything and defended against invaders. The one titan was my ward, i healed him I protec him and I murdered. He messaged me at the end of the game telling me to l2play
---
so, Lord of Wolves / One Eyed Mask?
---
too bad Crimson is dogshit. Metaphorically speaking :)
---
Agreed. The multikills were my biggest problem. Reached fabled before getting those done, but Quickplay /Iron Banner + The Colony fixed that.
---
One day I will join the Church of Unlimited Frames.
---
I have both it's just destiny grew too big for my SSD. My point was it's the system itself bottlenecking consoles. SSDs will help but the console hardware severely limits games when pushed for impressive visuals over performance.
---
Dive in. Just take your time with it. 
---
As long as you play 3 comp games a week, you get bonus points equivalent to about two wins. As long as you win one of those three, you make positive progress. 
---
If you are doing well and on a win streak, keep it going. If you lose a couple in a row, step away and take a break. 
---
Try and pick your play times. I found weekends during the day or early weekday evenings to be best. Too late in the night and all the better players start turning up. 
---
If you really want, you can also try and dodge full fireteams. Just keep an eye on player count during matchmaking. If the counter instantly goes up by 4, you can drop out. 
---
Beyond that, stick with your team and try and teamshoot. Play smart. Don‚Äôt storm off on your own and play the objective.
---
It‚Äôs still early enough in the season that free points can take you most of the way.
---
There is a big difference between console and pc in this scenario, on console ace is not the most common pvp weapon where as on pc there is usually only one reason to take it of, freaking lord of memes
---
Yikes
---
The majority of players are hunters, and the majority of whiners are hunters. Quick maffs.
---
No Lunas today. Dam
---
I was talking about both, I don't know why you assumed I wasn't.
---
The majority of whiners are non-OEM striker titans
---
‚ÄúSuck my ass hufflepuff!‚Äù
---
NEW VIEST WEAPON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Guess i‚Äôll die? No, you must fight to the very last moment. No need for any of that negativity
---
That's exactly what I was thinking. The private game mode we currently have is already in place. They can add matchmaking with set conditions we can choose from.
---
I don't think this particular item devalues the perk in any way.
---
I got my god role imperial decree. Grace robber and trench barrel with range masterwork. Only thing is the barrel and rounds aren‚Äôt the greatest for range. I think I‚Äôm gonna keep grinding until I get a god role with max range stat
---
100 times this. I recently had a conversation where people were saying that you can solo recluse relatively easily although it might take you all season to do it. My experience begs to differ though. You can't control who you get paired with but I can solo flawless shattered throne, so it must be me.
---
How would i post it ?
---
Because awoken can travel aswell
---
For sure, I wonder if it‚Äôs a way to justify this not being a particularly useful exotic
---
What‚Äôs a blueberry?
---
The Ascendant Challenge rotates every week. This week it's in the Garden of Esila.
---
Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well
---
If what you mean is the ascendant challenge portal, it changes weekly. This week it‚Äôs in the gardens of esila,
---
#BUNGIE BUNGIE, HOW YOU'VE MISSED THE MARK
---
Ok but didn't the awoken get stuck for 500 years or something
---
THANK YOU! Finally, somebody noticed.
---
As in you set the modifiers on your Give of Swords and matches you with someone with similar modifiers?
---
Lol glad u saw it, i doubt it will return however. They had all the weapons that they had made on display or at least most of them
---
Nessus is a lasagna? Who knew!?
---
Cool,i wont!
---
I hope so. Veist doesn't get it's fair share besides recluse.
---
That I can't really answer as I have no such experience with game development.
---
It sounds like Ace and Petra's gun being shot at the same time.
---
Well I took it more as if you use the modifier card then you have to solo/invite friends/lfg, and matchmaking would only work on a default nightfall with the standard light level and preset modifiers
---
Swap them and then it‚Äôs correct
---
I‚Äôm wholeheartedly with you there
---
SOON
---
Oh, we do fight to the very last moment! But that moment comes rather sharply when surrounded by 5 opposing guardians armed with Lunas Howl.
---
You do make a good point, I play the game enough to were it won't be a wasted investment.
---
It sounds like Ace and Petra's gun being fired at the same time to me. I don't know if this is meant to add some ambiguity to which character killed him, since it makes more sense for them both to have shot him anyway.
---
How? Lmao
---
Non-fireteam member. They show up as blue instead of green, hence the blueberry name
---
I regret everything
---
You can't get it without either having unlocked it in Season 3, or 6 via the Triumph. Without that, it's not available in your Vanguard loot pool.
---
Bungie did say there was an issue with the acquisition of the SR so they had to disable it for the time being, but it should be back sooner or later.
