I played it on Xbox through its lifespan. There are exclusive guns and armor on ps, but you can still play the game on Xbox with just as much content away from a few armor pieces and guns.
---
---
---
Just make most of these things menu items, hate walking all over the place to get bounties and stuff.
---
If that's how long it takes you to farm essence, you're doing it very ineffeciently. Get a group and speed run the Lake of Shadows in EDZ. Takes about 5 min to run with 3 people. That's 10-15 essence per run
---
Try it out see what you think!
---
Will do! Unlocked it right before leaving for holiday shenanigans üò¨
---
Well in PVE most enemies have an easy precision area to hit. Cabal, Fallen and Hive have reasonable size heads for you to shoot, not to mention Cabal... backpads I honestly don‚Äôt know what their called are massive areas to hit.
---

---
Vex is just shooting the torso area which is odd at first, but most to all players adapt to that eventually with time.
---
In PvP well tbh I don‚Äôt know what else to say except aim for the head. I get that‚Äôs not always possible based on where your position compared to the opposing player is, but most players get better at it as time goes on.
---
Imagine if after destiny 3 we got a destiny remastered, like modern warfare remastered. That would be dope.
---
Personally my go-to energy weapon.
---
The range fall off on it tho really drives me crazy in PvP.
---
Good luck, and merry Christmas!
---
I say this every time I wake up
---
You are fine to grind out the bounties, just don't turn them in. Completed bounties don't expire so you can wait until you reach the 960s
---
Just aim
---
I know a lot of people in the military who can‚Äôt shoot guns for shit though. 
---
However yeah he is holding it wrong but it‚Äôs not too big of a deal
---
It can be 3d printed. The guy who sold it used a 3d model _**with**_ working components.
---
Sorry to disappoint but range on HC isn't super worth no more because they capped the falloff range to 28 meters since shadowkeep
---
Awww, dang.
---
Ohhhh, okay. Thanks! Ive only heard rumors, sorry. Im just getting back into the game... i quit around the time warmind launched. Ive returned, bought the DLCs, and am starting it all up again. So sorry, i didnt know. Thanks for correcting me though! I didnt wanna spread misinformation!
---
Lol chicken wing
---
How do u get the blacksmith title?
---
Overusing? It‚Äôs only used twice once in the title and again because the title is repeated in the text
---
Oh wow that's amazing! I really appreciate that!
---
It is tied to do Scourge of the past raid triumphs and all 4 forges triumphs.
---
Tbh I kind of want the farm to be rebuilt so it‚Äôs useful, like I know the tower is the place for everyone to go, it‚Äôs the sanctuary, etc. but the farm feels neglected and sad, and it‚Äôs such a cool place.
---
Found the Titan shill
---
This is more then likely the reason.
---
It‚Äôs a bug. Chill.
---
I'm gonna need proof.
---
Tormund, Jon Snow and... ?
---
There's a bug right now, it's doing it for everyone i think.
---

Have to pay 100,000 silver to make it stop
---
I‚Äôve died about 25 times to it in iron bannerüòÖ
---
How do you farm this? Just by completing full EP waves?
---
Laughs in sidearms and mini hammer Titan
---
Destiny the game became a rant forum where kids go to complain. This forums far better because it allows memes and the mods are reasonable.
---
As the warlock pictured Thank you!
---
Well, I just learned it was Savathun mimicking her. Chill down my spine.
---
No blade length limits in Tennessee either.
---
This is rad, a great way to spend quality time with your kid!
---

---
I‚Äôm a big fan of low effort futurama posts...take my upvote
---
I wish seasonal mods could either be put on exotics, or put on gauntlets and space magic makes it change the bullet to anti-barrier, overload, etc. I would've liked to have anti-barrier on the Ace of Spades last season. Anti-barrier Graviton would be fun.
---
Is the Leviathan's breath just not obtainable anymore? I have the quest but can't do the strike
---
It is! I didn‚Äôt have any ideas of what to put in it yet but this is a great idea that‚Äôs for the inspiration. (I was the Warlock)
---
Yeah but you will get 1 piece from wave 7 from the chest. Now the chest doesn‚Äôt require a key to open it.
---
Think how hard he had to grind for that
---
Fair point. I'm just saying when I hear "hangar", I think of storage/garage. Do the original point of "wtf it's literally a hangar! Why can't I land there??" doesn't really click for me.
---
So freaking cool!
---
What about ace?
---
Elbow down, blueberry.
---
&amp;#x200B;

:P
---
Someone is out of crayons
---
Tell me how I‚Äôm wrong. Btw how‚Äôs your dawning armor? A blue generic cape, a single shoulder pad, and a knife placed somewhere?
---
Warlocks are the least played as far as i know hunters are the most.
---
Jokingly I want to say it looks like a poop tornado! But seriously looks great
---
I think i got it from drifter. You can also get it from playing gambit. If you want a reliable way to farm it, you can get it through one of the obelisks. Pick up the bounty, complete the objective and hope for the best.
---
Still waitin on that reply on how I‚Äôm wrong. None yet.
---
Thank you for this comment, I‚Äôll never let it go.
---
Just wait till the 15 gambit kills....
---
Same in Illinois.
---
Looks great, and at least it‚Äôs not crayons or a titan would‚Äôve ate them all by now
---
I got it from a crucible match i lost.
---
*bounties 
---
For the love of god, man.
---
I only snack on the high quality stuff.
---
I still don‚Äôt why these gifts move inventory slots when you open one. I wasn‚Äôt paying attention once and got dismantled like 6 upgrade modules.
---
Same problem here. I have the quest and no oven to be found
---
I'm pretty sure that one is the "official" sub for destiny so it is frequented by devs of the game. They actually will reply on posts from time to time, so people take that as an opportunity to air their issues with the game and point out flaws on a platform where they will be heard. Which isnt really a bad thing because it is nice to know that the devs are listening and there have been countless adjustments because of the community feedback, but at the same time it makes it a really crappy sub for people who just want to enjoy and talk about their experience with the game. That's where this sub comes in though, it is much more laid back and positive in my opinion. I actually quit following the other sub because of all the negativity.
---
Sorry for the wall'o'text
---
I haven‚Äôt gotten on yet.  Are the servers queueing up or are they good?
---
How?!
---
Yeah pretty much small stuff. I also wrote down all the locations of the rabbit statues on the moon and checked off the ones I had. Also got the final 3 keys i need for the Mars sleeper nodes which i can never get.
---
PLEASE
---
To be honest, I get why they are complaining. Game has started to go to a bad direction slowly again. I do hope that Bungie makes Trials a thing and hopefully balances the crucible a bit. Would fix a while lot, since most of the complaints arw about crucible, and eververse.
---
I am a newb so can you explain why so much salt? You can't lose valor. I am assuming it is just like regular control and you get valor for losing as well. I don't have any of the guns people complain about on here. I finish anywhere from first on my team to last. You win some, you lose some it is a game. Relax, breathe and have fun.

I have used a m&amp;kb for as long as I have had a PS4. I don't think it gives any distict advantage on D2. I also doubt you can tell if someone is using one.

I found a new trick, instead of fast traveling there go to another location on earth and sparrow over

I'm Kinda new and curious what do you mean

I mean, I suppose you can still tap that finishing touch by hitting the V, but there has to be a reason why the default was the good ol' G ... unless it was purely arbitrary just to torture us... right?

The real trick was sending us to look for those morons there.

Hunter armor cones with all types of shapes and sizes and patterns and accessories, I‚Äôm not gonna waste my night typing up an essay on my phone for some dipshit on reddit with a god complex
---
Least for pvp builds

The truth about hunter armor being generic doesn‚Äôt hurt? That‚Äôs good
---
Finisher button on keyboard is the G key... which isn't exactly the most comfortable button to reach if you have small fingers in the heat of a battle.
---
I know right??
---
I think that's the only quest that matters.
---
It isnt all the same
---
Haha all I want is a filter on my post office to auto-dismantle based on my settings, a notification indicating my post office is reaching capacity would be a nice cherry on top
---
Which sparrow is that?
---
I‚Äôve had mine for about a year and a half and I‚Äôve had no trouble
---
You got it as a gift? I got it from hours of grinding , consider yourself lucky
---
Name one that doesn‚Äôt fit my discription other than year 1 solstice ornaments or last seasons ornaments.
---
The forges rotate each day. You don't have to go to each individual forge anymore. Just wait till it pops into the rotation at edz
---
&gt; So then why can‚Äôt you provide any examples?
---
Aaah okay i see. Thanks!
---
Is he having the best time ever?!
---
The forges can only be activated from the director in the bottom left of the edz. It rotates through all the forges daily so you have to wait till burgusia is the active forge.
---
Bruh atleast get him a decent PC
---
Imagine being the trickster goddess and getting outsmarted by fucking Calus.
---
I'm sure it's not that embarrassing. It's so easy to sink hours into this game that you might actually be on the lower side...maybe not though lol
---
Used to take a Prospector to find them
---
I know, I said I have a similar file, it's very likely they're the same thing
---
Its not a bug. Ignore the old guides for it. They are wrong since October.
---
Go to ada and pick up the mysterious box quest. If ada has nothing for you then you need to do the introductory quest " black armory machine gun".
---
The forges are on a daily rotation. You access them through the EDZ area, it will be on the bottom left. You can only access whatever forge is active today. You cannot do anything with the forges out in the wilderness now. They must be accessed through the forge playlist. You also cannot see the forge option in the EDZ if you havent completed that introductory quest I mentioned earlier.
---
It will take you a few days of the forges rotating to get what you need. But the part that will hold you up is the part that requires you to turn in a rare black armory bounty. People have gone weeks without getting one.
---
My bad
---
Every time I hit 1k I go get my 40 mod components
---
I was pleasantly surprised with these a10s. Got em for a good price too
---
Probs a titan main
---
What r u talked about?
---
Damn bfing420, step it up.
---
Let me guess about everyone had either low or mind benders oh and dont forget erentill
---
eh did mine with a curated better devils with explosive payload, and an ikelos. But yes the rocket launcher step was painful, got through that with twin tails.
---
My point is pvp is ass and "you're wrong" isn't anything near a point
---
Well with Iron Banner out, just run that for a day and you'll be able to do it in no time.
---
That‚Äôs reasonable. I should probably start spending my mod components on mods I don‚Äôt have, I always forget to check banshee every day.
---
Your name says Titan next to it. Also I thought it was a typo that sounded like something a Titan would say
---
It‚Äôs plastic but it looks like metal
---
Thanks!
---
Yea I ran a couple IV matches and not even gonna play again this week. It‚Äôs pointless since we are getting old ornaments anyway. They‚Äôve used these ornaments 3 times since the game was released. They just made them 2.0 now which is completely pointless to me
---
Looks like a fifa collectors edition box
---
I think you can still go to the farm
---
Totally agree, it‚Äôs like constant complaining. Still cool though that our community stirred up some noise on Christmas.
---
It‚Äôs not bugged i just did it yesterday..but I could not do it solo. Had to get another person to cover switches 123, while I handled 456

No Riskrunner?

You literally reposted this after QQing that you got downvoted for not properly formatting your post.

Without properly formatting your repost.

They can try. Just gotta time the melee
---
I ran into this problem as well.  
---
1.  You can go to another destination and come back to repeat the patrol right in front of the lighthouse.  
---
2.  There is another patrol spot nearby.  Walk out of lighthouse and turn right at the first patrol spot.  Then walk all the way down the hill to where there is a floating "warp ring" transporter.  The patrol is just before you reach that ring.

I‚Äôm ok at best, I just try to give my kids the childhood I always wished I had. He‚Äôs been geeking out all day over this PC, definitely a winner.
---
Dust rock blues + crimson. All 6 of them had it.
---
Dust rock blues and crimson was the mixture
---
One has a history of being annoying. The other a history of being a toxic crutch that gave you an overshield and a damage bonus. There was a bonus in literally every engagement. Either a mark that told you exactly where the enemy was for almost 15 seconds, or 2x the health of the guy. Worm husk could only be used at most every 9 seconds. 
---
It‚Äôs the truth

We, the Gatekeepers of the Front page(AKA Users who sort by **New**) find your post unworthy.

Any way I can still get it? I‚Äôm not sure how loot crate works but it just sounds like a nice thing to have and I‚Äôm kinda curious

They are, but if one thousand voices spread them it would be anarchy.

That‚Äôs smart, it‚Äôs the only one that I don‚Äôt have to level 11
---
hahahah never thought of it, so I guess at some level you were right! Let me guess you're hunter main?

Have an upvote!

The fact it‚Äôs soloable really degrades it‚Äôs value.

Yesterday I had to load out and in SEVENTEEN times!

we get stuff for supporting the game, you can still obtain all that stuff outside of certain cosmetics by just playing.
---
if you call it P2W simply cause you want to freeload on content then thats your problem.
---
Yep
---
Are you on steam?
---
That I did not think of. Good point!
---
Same here! Shit sucks. I've done 2/3 characters so far. I swear I need some armor for my last guy
---
You can but there‚Äôs not really a purpose, it has eververse, a cryptarch, and the clan person with the bird ( I forget her name) if there was a shaxx, drifter, etc. it would be a cool place
---
This has suddenly become even more relatable

LMFAOOOO FAV COMMENT

Bungie.com
---
On bungie.net
---
Should be under collections, flair, emblems. Then one of those tabs.
---
First time, he‚Äôs been dying to play with us. I‚Äôve played Minecraft, terraria, sonic etc with him but never anything like this. This is his first ‚Äúmature‚Äù game and all his idea
---
Unlocks a door to get into the underbelly on the leviathan
---
I already redeemed the code, I need to figure out where to actually get it in-game.
---
Im such a rational person I can't make an argument without insulting the person I'm arguing with
---
Also, I feast on crayons
---
Drifter will probably be extatic though.
---
Yes, gotta learn sometime. Poor guy was down for like two hours lol
---
As someone who likes to use bows, the arbalest has just been a kick in the teeth, but nothing will be more rage inducing to me than getting shotgunned down from 7 fucking meters away right as you turn a corner. Its asinine and makes me so fuckin mad XD
---
I haven‚Äôt been able to find the ones I‚Äôve claimed under any tab.
---
No worries man, sometimes changes to the game fly under the radar.
---
It‚Äôll be in the first tab, like right when you switch to emblems. Might be on the second page. What emblems?
---
I use a fucking sword because I'm stupid. But hey I get to skip slow elevators and drops. The Titan sword let's you ground pound with no fall damage.
---
the monte carlo has one of the most simple, yet nice designs on a weapon by far
---
Thank fuck I'm not the only one who is not doing the charged with light mods. I'm still master working my perfect 60 iron banner armor from last season. The grind is real in this game.
---
How does it work?
---
I need it too! And i'm in the same situation as you
---
Are you on PC?
---
I just started a crucible game but right after I can help you
---
Solstice armor from the next solstice event will be your best bet, unfortunately you're gonna have to wait a while
---
This is the way
---
I don‚Äôt know the refresh rate but those might be capped at 30hz but I think they‚Äôre 60hz displays. That‚Äôs going to lock you at 60 frames but you need to make sure the resolution and target FPS are in line with the display
---
What gen is the CPU?
---
Let me be the first to say the Rat King.  Its compact, its reliable, it‚Äôs flashy, it turns you invisible and it heals you.  Perfect for the um-and-coming Hunter Vanguard.
---
I know my female anatomy. However I‚Äôm very uneducated when it comes to Destiny keyboard anatomy. I for one press down on one of my sticks to finish.
---
Yeah
---
Oh wow really? I didnt know light levels would make such a difference when theyre that close in level. but even then it doesnt make sense cause Im at a solid 965, so it wouldnt make that much of a difference.
---
Chaperone. Just the right size to hide under my cape and surprise any fallen who think the hunter must be packing nothing but a hand cannon.
---
Hey I snagged the same PC too! I upgraded the RAM TO 32gb and added a SSD for additional storage since it only came with 256GB 
---
Link [for anyone who is interested](https://brickseek.com/walmart-inventory-checker/?sku=902037635)
---
2000 valor or glory? Cause those two are very different. Valor points cap out at 2000. Glory goes past that
---
Dawning essence drops but only like 2 for failing
---
I‚Äôm going to be honest every Hunter I see runs a shotgun
---
Well that explains everything. Power level differences. If you're around 5 or so levels lower, you won't be able to 2 punch another guardian.
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
Computers behind the currently occupied "soccer field"
---
Definitely does NOT break rule one. It clearly says the mods are not bungie. That does not say that community mods or devs are not members of the sub
---
You literally can‚Äôt bring your light under 750.
---
Literally all I want is a godroll Sacred Provenance.
---
Idk, but it would be super cool. Him just being there, all cool and stuff, feeding his berbs, should suffice for my friend tho ehehe
---
Finished in about 45 minutes. It's not as hard as everyone makes it out to be
---
Oh damn i didnt know such a small difference would do that. Im generally around 965 in light, so I wouldnt think it would make such a difference, especially now with the dawning artifact being new and not lending too many levels just yet. Interesting, but infuriating none the less XD
---
Gotta love the warlocks burst glide. There‚Äôs no way in hell you‚Äôre making it back, but at least you can go find the edge of the map or a kill wall.
---
I don't know where else to look then.
---
He‚Äôd kill you for a blue engram
---
All energy Weapons here, like we haven't had these weapons FOR MULTIPLE SEASONS BUNGIE. Seriously though. And out of 300+ tokens I got 4 armor pieces...... The questline gave me garbage stat rolls, surprisingly....I'm not doing this on my other characters. Farming timelost bounties for god rolls is a better use of time.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm editing a video from when we were all trying to get one prior to that change.
---
Rat King's Crew and Outbreak Perfected are unrelated. There are guides available on the internet and youtube specifically for both quests.
---
Looks like he‚Äôs firing off his bicep too üòÇ
---
Oh I did the shotgun quest step over the course of like a dozen matches, it's just I couldn't get one rocket kill in 5 matches. I'm still figuring which rocket launcher would be best, but I figure I'll just use the banner supplied one, Bear.
---
Knock back is broken
---
Kids going places, Tower for starters.
---
Theres a bad luck protection now. If you didn¬¥t get it after x tries your chance will increase.
---
I personally look for anything with Archer‚Äôs Tempo, which cuts down a bit of draw speed time when landing a precision hit. Doesn‚Äôt even have to be a kill. 
---
I‚Äôve got two favorites that I haven‚Äôt found anything to replace for both the kinetic and energy slot, they are:
---
Spiteful Fang (Black Armory bow)
---
Flexible String
---
Straight Fletching
---
Archer‚Äôs Tempo
---
Explosive Head
---
Arsenic Bite
---
Elastic String
---
Carbon Arrow Shaft
---
Rampage
---
Honestly, explosive head is straight up consistent extra damage on every shot with no prerequisites. It even gives you a little chip if you miss. I'd take explosive perks over reload perks any day of the week.
---
No! Turn back! That‚Äôs a great plan.
---
Problem: You will only become charged with light when you rapidly kill players with shotgun. That means 2 players with 3 second difference or so. Make sure you got shotgun scavenger on your boots tho
---
Cha-cha real smooth
---
is this a joke ? First of all there are A LOT of thing a human with any brain capacity knows is just bad and shouldnt exist.  Like why can a  stack queue vs a team full of randoms ? 
---
Make the rocket launcher kill 3 instead of 10. There is literally a quest where you ONLY need to get 3 kills with supers. So why the hell do you need 10 kills with heavy ? 
---
You overrate shitty Pinnacle so hard.  The 4 pinnacle drops a practically worthless. ESPECIALLY if you get 3 of them in the same slot like 80% of the people.
---
Have you seen how many stomp games there have been in IB. From my counting the numbers scyrockets from 1 in 10 in normal control, to every second or third game being a stomp. So clearly matchmaking doesnt work.
---
Lastly this little post doesn matter, Bungie is incompetent and lazy. they will never fix shit, or it will take them months. Especially if it is PvP.
---
i have outlaw, quickdraw and its pretty deadly
---
In order for the door to unlock to get the fallen transponder, you must complete the ‚ÄúEnemy of my Enemy ‚Äúquest, which gives you the Rat Kings Crew quest.
---
Have a look at the quest in your inventory. It sends you a lot of places with manual interaction steps.
---
Makes me wish arcstrider had a ranged attack. Love the abilities just wish it wasn‚Äôt all melee supers. Been booped by every boss in the game I bet.
---
Idk about Evas bounties, but make sure you complete Osiris quests.
---
I used one with a wide explosion radius, I suck at using RLs in pvp, so I just wanted assured kills. Picked one up that had the biggest blast radius and cluster bombs and blew people off corners, just shot the floor near them and that was it.
---
I actually ended up wasting heavy ammo a couple of times doing that, one it was a warlock that was fluttering about and I totally misread the radar (radar shows a deeper shade of red when the enemy it‚Äôs at the same altitude as you are) and another was me getting sniped like an idiot when trying to blow a bunch of people up when they were capping a zone (good idea, just awful execution on my part).
---
Anyhow, just keep it up man, you‚Äôll get it done no proba.
---
This isn't a real gun?
---
There are some many reasons for that. What error are you getting ?
---
**Laughs in Perfect Paradox**
---
Why does destiny 1 armor looks so much better than the destiny 2 armor. The only exception (in my opinion) is the iron truage hunter casque. That‚Äôs top tier.
---
Idk man, that nightfall is pretty gnarly
---
So you're the one hogging all the purple
---
*cries in PC and xbone player*
---
You can‚Äôt apply that as a mod. You have to have a piece with it still on.
---
[laughs in sunbracers]
---
Someone in Bungie must love the movie
---
That gun is aids on a stick.
---
I don't see why not, it is a really great one
---
Imagine doing it on all 3 characters
---
It's especially funny when you consider most will probably dismantle the armor as soon as they get a new shiny one they love more.
---
Gives access to raid chests in different sections. You get keys from completing encounters in the raid.
---
If you unlonck something once, u can always pull it from collection (doesn't work with Y2 &amp; Y3 legendary armor and weapons tho). Just the way in which you can obtain it will not be there.
---
Yes, you can still take it from collection next season.
---
No thanks lol
---
I did all three for a triumph recently and it sucked. Wouldn‚Äôt want to do this quest line on them.
---
How did this even cross your mind with that idea?
---
Where are the crayons
---
Ah I see you're a guardian of culture as well ...
---
Iron banner season pursuit which needs to be completed to hand in tokens
---
r/therewasanattempt
---
I play outside my comfort zone but this quest step without a coordinated team is kind of stupid.
---
IB gives enhanced mods (Check them out in your collections). A good enough reason to grind if you don't have them already.
---
PM me
---
Oh ok, I honestly wasn't aware. I might jump in then, thanks.
---
It‚Äôs not being able to farm tokens that is why I‚Äôm pushing the pursuit you can‚Äôt hand in tokens until it‚Äôs done. I don‚Äôt mind pvp I‚Äôm not a god at it but I enjoy it enough to go back each week and dick around I‚Äôve gotten most pinnacles from crucible and I wanna farm the tokens overall I enjoy iron banner but this quest step has killed all my fun today and left me feeling like what was the point.
---
Probably didnt think the task was worth our time until all 9 of those incompetent meatballs mamaged to die
---
*Smol Cute Hydra boi*
---
I personally think hes better than the real thing.
---
Lfg does exist for this reason.
---
I get it if you dot want too. But every time IB pops its head up, hundreds of posts go up of people looking for a team to get wins and progress bounties.
---
Had to have some drawbacks with the two damage perks... Or you can try to get a random roll with rampage+kc and a better mag perk.
---
Someone please explain. Did you have the catalyst?
---
In PvP Le Monarque is still the best bow. Especially with oath keepers.
---
r/phalanxed
---
Lul I wish, I'm too lazy to grind that out.
---
Lolwhat. You come into a thread and make a scenario in your head and call me stupid, I call you dumb and I'm the salty one? Self-evaluate homie
---
Happy holidays
---
Try to increase your mobility, and put up an LFG post, I‚Äôm sure someone would jump in to help you quickly
---
Drop mag, rampage, kill clip, range mw.
---
Thought maybe that‚Äôs why it shot like that, I‚Äôm so lost then, does anybody have time to explain what I don‚Äôt have time to understand?
---
this was by far the most painfull one
---
the hand canon one was a breeze and shotguns was a joke 
---
but power ammo can suck it. if it was for the warden cliff i would be so upset right now
---
Prolly just a bug. It only shot on of the rockets from it's volley.
---
Good old tokens
---
You are one sadistic motherfucker.
---
They gonna down vote you for the truth my G....
---
Well yeah it‚Äôs a shitpost
---
Lol bud knowing heavy and grabbing it is a different thing thing deliberately making me go for heavy kills
---
I do these fucking things already you assume I am bad XD
---
The problem is again I don't use heavy what so ever also I DONT HAVE AN ENTIRE TEAM going for heavy because of heavy kills
---
I go for heavy in normal games yes
---
But the game changes entirely because a fucking quest MAKES basically AN ENTIRE team go for it so it's either you don't go for heavy AND PLAY THE OBJECTIVE AND GAME
---
Or go for heavy and become again A DETRIMENT to your team
---
Your entire post is condensing and people like you piss me off so much because you do nothing to add to the conversation and instead proceed to just go "git gud kid"
---
Ah okay, thanks boss
---
Have an upvote for the truth.
---
Play better.
---
I guess that's i9 9900k
---
Oh nice! A campfire!
---
I used to be the operator of a nice excal prime, now I'm an exo dodging mountain tops.
---
Say happy holidays to all the people there that I will never see again.
---
Maybe I am tilted, but it's all I see from my games. And I'm not being unrealistic when a 6-man team has either a NF + Revoker or Thorn/Spare Rations + Mindbenders. There's 3 main lanes, hard to do anything when a hardscoping revoker sits there all day or when the entire Fireteam teamshoots and farms you.
---
Also it's Warlocks that deal with the Arc Ability kills. It doesn't matter what _**you**_ used, my teammates are getting stomped trying to do the Scout part because the distance is closed so fast
---
After many days of it not working, I read it was working today and when I checked I was able to interact with it
---
And that's why the curated roll of Bad Omens rocks, ADS a little and watch death unfold.
---
What's after the rocket step?
---
It's really good
---
But Riven won't stomp me. No matter how much I want her to...
---
Then change teams?
---
You're being farmed? Quit the lobby.
---
The way matchmaking works you should have a 50/50 chance to either farm or be farmed, with some very close games happening here and there.
---
If too many people are super sweaty just quit and play at some other time, or get a team and stomp people back?
---
Sorry but where are they exactly? Not seeing any IB mods
---
I usually just rush kill the boss
---
I'm not a quitting bitch. And I'm not sociable, that's why I said there should be a Freelance component to Iron Banner. Then people went apeshit and rushed the downvote button
---
Therein lies your misunderstanding.
---

Exotic Scout called Skyburner's Oath. It has two firing modes, and although I haven't used it myself, the hipfire one looks very nice. Like fireworks being lobbed at the enemies
---
Not sure tbh... veteran players likely have access to old masks from collections which have a 0 power level so they can equip them to reduce power below 750....
---
Not sure what new light players can do tbh üò¨
---
True i can remember having alot of fun on the mars map, it was soo cool designed. Truth was super fun and playing with those vehicles, especially the 'Psion-Tanks' were awesome.
---
Earth and Moon map were cool too
---
Bottom tree striker is pretty dope in PvP - and I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs much different than running the map w/spectral blades.  At least a Titan is a glowing ball of lightening that you can see barreling towards you, whereas Hunters are invisible ...until it‚Äôs too late
---
You mind explaining it shortly then? Your post is just a novel
---
bro how old is this screenshot
---
That's just RNG odds catching up.
---
Adds up quickly over a few hrs or a day/night though
---
Another thing it promotes is people leaving matches if they see it being camped too much. Even I did that myself to find other games where players weren't humping it like a horny dog on your leg.
---
Arbalest is a beautiful beast of a gun. Lol. I don't know why everyone is suddenly so toxic about it.
---
Totally worth the downvotes.

Do you have what people are saying ‚Äúgod rolls‚Äù from each obelisk?.

This. I don't know why everyone is so damned whiney about this Iron Banner's seasonal quest. It's not like getting RL kills is difficult.

So I am not the only one with this problem

This

Where's the hanger?
---
"cook up some supercharged 'light' and feed it to the primeevil
---
I got it just a few weeks before season 9 started by doing the nascent dawn questline so unless it's changed since then this is still a quest.  I was a new light player when forsaken came out.  Need to find a solid clan that doesn't mind teaching you everything.  I still struggle on how to do what, but I had a great group to help me get the tough exotics like the wishender bow.  What I did was kinda crazy but I love getting all the exotics.  Make a list of all the weapon exoitcs, youtube the next one you want to work on and keep going.  Only need 15 or so, it's tedious but there is more to this game than any new light player can fathom.
---
He'd be proud to know he beat the Vex so hard they honoured him.
---
To avoid nerfs! Big brain time

If you read the information at the bottom in that link it says its something you can get from bright engrams.
---
Oh, I guess I have an amoles screen. Thanks for this. :)
---
Console games don't interest me.
---
No, I didn‚Äôt. This is good to know at least, now I won‚Äôt feel completed cheated when I finish my last bounty and inevitably get another scout...
---
That‚Äôs every Bubble Sentinels dream scenario. Good stuff lad.
---
I'd hope so. He kicked the shit outta some Vex. Knowing my luck though, he'd lose his mind.
---
That is why you fail.
---
I think it's a design issue. You can "fail" (run out of time) every encounter but still progress to eventually the boss fight.
---
Like you though, I‚Äôm wanting something a bit more interactive. I‚Äôve even thought about picking up Minecraft in hopes he likes it. 
---
Just god don‚Äôt let him get hooked on Fortnite, XD
---
So this is what 8K is like, amazing! Our future has never looked brighter. Thank you.

Which I did while trying to do the ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt die while doing two public events‚Äù bounty.

"Problem reading game content. Please close Destiny w, right click in the steam app to run 'verify integrity of game files' in 'properties' then restart to they again"
---
In did this before and after verifying files it still crashed.

But I'm doing the process again hoping I missed something
---
Just gotta farm them from any activity that can drop prime engrams. He shows up tomorrow at noon EST though, check whereisxur.com a few minutes afterward to find out where.
---
If you travel to the past, that past becomes your new future, and your former present becomes the past, which can‚Äôt now be changed by your new future.
---
He will be here tomorrow. Until then, I‚Äôd suggest running nightfalls. You will also get exotics by just putting the time in and playing. Exotics can drop from any activity.
---
If you don‚Äôt wanna use ds4 then you‚Äôre gonna have to buy the adapter or find another program.
---
just finish this yesterday... felt so good .
---
It doesn't really help when Saladin decides to give you four energy weapons...
---
Precision targeting.
---
Did you give her a basic tutorial or did she just jump in blind to play it? Now if its the latter then that says something about her teammates if a new player with no real game knowledge plays better than them.
---
I actually got my girlfriend those for Christmas as well xD they are so amazing
---
Thanks. I figured, but ya know, shotgun.
---
Range is still good as it increases target acquisition and bullets magnetize a little more
---
Yeah if im not mistaken we had 3 maps, one on earth, moon and mars
---
Shadowkeep Deluxe Edition included 4 season passes, though I doubt there‚Äôs gonna be another expansion after the fourth season. I‚Äôd save the silver since you can earn most ornaments and other cosmetics pretty easily.
---
Kinda sounds like masturbation with delusions of grandeur.....
---
If you are asking if there are more watchers, then just leave the room after you kill everything in it and then go back in after the door closes behind you.
---
Just keep em for the season passes. Even after a new forsaken-scale expansion drops, there'll still be season passes. More bang for your buck.
---
I did this yesterday lol
---
If you're only getting cheap shots with it you're using it wrong.
---
Also past a certain skill level it's pretty hard to get cheap shots because no one will let you. If you successfully charge someone it's because you set it up on purpose and they fell for it.
---
What do those scions actually do in this battle?
---
I just immediately punch them because of ptsd from the gauntlet.
---
A good roll of Nightwatch is a pretty good scout rifle.  I currently love my rapid hit &amp; multikill clip one.
---
Yeah, I say try all kinds of games, see what he likes and play with him when you can. I got lucky with Fortnite. He came home one day and told me all about how all the kids are playing it and asked if I played it. I told him I did and I wasn't a fan, but if he wanted to try it, I would let him download it on my switch. He told me he watched some YouTube videos and decided he didn't like it.
---
Thank you!
---
Cold take: no matter how good your internet is, it's gonna occasionally drop signal or randomly DC for a split second at some point
---
Go to earth or Nessus and chase those public events. It's fairly easy to go from one to the next.
---
Haha yea you got lucky. We will see if I am.
---
Omae wa mo shinderu.....üëÄ

It's always been my understanding that if they find out you are using MnK you get banned.  You should be.  To the guy who openly admits it, you should be ashamed of yourself.  Haven't you ever seen the Keyboard warriors on PC, they shame all consoles because PC is far superior to the heathen controller folk.
---
Izanagis and divinity first
---
Maybe the lake is a metaphor
---
Leviathan's Breath is pretty straightforward to get solo.
---
I need for the "Relics of the Golden Age" , will getting Exotic items instead do the trick too?
---
Leviathans is super easy to grind, go to the leviathan raid and just kill cabal.  Bad juju is a little long, and I kind of forgot how long the lumina quest is, but the gun is super fun to use
---
Public events. I suggest Titan as they have the most speedrunny public events. 5 essence each. Oh and grab the scavange/exterminate patrols while at it, 2 essence for free.
---
Strange, I have been using wardcliff for all of my kills. It works for me
---
Big fan of the Xenophage myself, even though it‚Äôs more of a heavy sniper than a machine gun.

What the shit!? Is this PS3?

For me it was those damn shotgun kills. Everyone was running around with their shotty out and every time you ran around a corner you were getting one shotted.
---
True, my clan plays IB together most weeks its up, we aren't all Unbroken gods of crucible but a few are and everyones decent but we don't stomp every random team. We've been mercy ruled before by randoms and lost plenty, its just how it is. Depends on how serious you play and such but no one is perfect and some solo players are insanely good.
---
Sorry, my internet messed up and I thought the first one didn‚Äôt went through
---
 Coolguy did a video on the range changes, and he tested a max range hand canon vs the worst range hand canon and the difference was literally 3 meters. I tend to go for handing or stability now
---
lower your light level to below 750
---
then go in to your date and time settings and manually change them to a few months ago  
---
now hop into the forges and run it and dont touch your controller/keyboard  
---
you'll die and a minute later you will get essence   
---
i do it when i leave to work and come back to a ton of essence
---
Might want to turn down that sensitivity a bit lol.
---
Yea I think that's the video I watched too :)
---
Google Stadia ain't looking too great
---
Clears it up thanks a bunch :)
---
Middle tree Nuka bomb 4 life and since I'm an asshole in PvP I also use Contraverse.
---
It used to be Blades at close range would destroy a bubble, and because each blade making contact would rewarded damage points~ my end of match damage in Mayhem would easily be in the six figures.  I‚Äôd get hate messaged about how I was hacking damage stats (...which let‚Äôs be real, is something that *ALMOST* no one should care about.  Damage in a match of constant supers?  Who cares?)
---
Been playing on Stadia, and there are a lot of matches like this, be it because of internet connections or simply teams of Kinderguardians. It doesn't feel great, giving potentially new players the concept that this is what Crucible/IB is like (or conversely being the 2.8 efficiency in a team of less than 0.5s), but at the same time, I've completed all my IB bounties and have multiple We Ran Out of Medals now.
---
I assume it‚Äôs because they broke without activision, you‚Äôre correct there‚Äôs 100% a lack of quality in the shadowkeep expansion, and if it isn‚Äôt a case of money then they are just being lazy
---
if you are on pc, join me, let us grind together
---
It‚Äôs the method I have been doing so far 
---
Not the patrols though
---
That‚Äôs a good idea
---
It's not an issue. This sub is a very small snapshot of the million+ people playing destiny. 
---
But there's a very vocal minority that wants everything to have zero challenge and argues fervently if you say anything against it.

My uncle got it for me

Middle Tree stormcaller, big beamy boi
---
IT IS NoT A METAPHOR!
---
I was about to drop the quest because that shit was so time consuming
---
IT IS NOT A METAPHOR!
---
I watched 3 of my omens shots go around guardians last night, and it had tracking.
---
It will always be a thing
---
Yeah thats exactly it. Like the step was annoying. But its not even close to being as bad as some other quest steps
---
Personally that's an issue to me. To progress you should do it properly otherwise get stuck.
---
People would need to learn what to do or give up, either way both are great results for those who know what to do but can't because most people don't give a shit to learn.
---
The one for the sundial
---
Because literally everyone in the game is after heavy and you can really get like 1 kill with it if you don't die, also the super kills sucked really bad for me because I'm  a low intellect hunter, and every one would just super as soon as i did and obliterate me, I also only got 1 super per game
---
oh I'm not sure what they do honestly
---
Kill me. Do it. Kill me, I'm here. Come on, do it. Kill me
---
I have the "panic melee" issue as well. Probably from playing Titan forever. This season I forced myself to try out other classes and Warlock is pretty damn fun!
---
Destiny 1 had it

Considering that Black Forest cake is an actual type of cake, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not likely related to portal.

Former Titan main here as well, actually... some things just never go away hahaha.

You have a point however my idea was mainly drawn off of how 1) failsafe and GLaDOS are both AI and 2) why is it infinite forest (mercury) cake for the Nexus merchant?
---
Halloween mask, if you kept any starting weapons and armor from year 1, and there is a white class item that's low light level in collections.

Y1 at the very least

I gave up on it for now. I'll wait until.they figure what they fucked up and manage to fix it for a day or two.

Those purple bricks are ammo pickups for heavy weapons, which are usually the strongest and most fun weapons to use. The ammo doesn't drop often though so seeing that much of it at once is usually exciting.
---
The forsaken story is worth playing imo, shadowkeep isn't tho
---
Good one
---
Oh yeah I forgot. Jesus dude. Had the same with tower.
---
I did as well
---
Wasn't joking.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt even work on console lmao
---
It takes a great minute on console to load our screen when you want to swap weapons in for example a crucible match 
---
BR would destroy this game‚Äôs loading times
---
I understand why it is why it is. It's just dull seeing the same animations over and over and over and over again.
---
I know dude
---
I feel like I‚Äôm a titan that was born to be a hunter
---
Usually 9+ camping around heavy today......makes getting "B" easier!
---
yea
---
Oh yeah I‚Äôm currently reading about the battle of six fronts and it‚Äôs going into detail about that has happened
---
I have a minor theory (yes, untested) that it has range falloff, because I've headshot people across maps to do minimal damage, but Still do full damage in relatively close quarters
---
Right, but everyone can use the shotgun. We're talking purely about abilities. Saying everything was fine because you could use a shotgun to counter a class ability is a silly argument. That would be like saying you can just use a rocket launcher to counter the hand held Nova. Yeah, you can, but it's not comparable. Weapon to weapon, ability to ability.
---
Black is so sexy on the rabbit
---
It's still just as strong. It's just Titans now are crying because they're not the only one with a one shot kill ability. It's all fun and games until someone levels the playing field, eh?
---
I'll give you a gold if I could.
---
Indeed
---
I got hooked on special ammo
---
This is beautiful thank you
---
They are not skippable. Technically you could just not do them, but there's at least one quest that requires you to complete Forsaken, and a variety of quests and activities that require Shadowkeep completion.
---
No, just get over it
---
Yeah having rocket kills be part of the quest was a bad idea. I got 2 characters down already though, just 1 more to go.
---
Man, this is a perfect example to show people who "miss the good ol' days of Destiny 1". You think it was better, it was not.
---
Though I do miss my baby, Ice Breaker.
---
No no no!
---
This season is much longer than the last one. I think it ends sometime in February. 
---
We don't know when or how seasonal exotics will return. We just know that they will be temporarily unobtainable after a season ends, but some time (possibly several months) after, they will be reintroduced to the game.

See, me. I do it wrong. I‚Äôm a Slowvalock with 100 discipline and a further grenade-boosting build - Demolitionist on weapons, Nezarec or Verity‚Äôs Brow - because that‚Äôs how I like to play. I consider that ‚Äúme‚Äù and other builds as secondary alternates when a fireteam needs it. But that‚Äôs an awful way to play! Sure I was lucky last season with Disruption grenades, but this season I‚Äôm clearly inferior. I‚Äôd be smarter to practice everything and go with the flow. 
---
You‚Äôre gonna have bounties, fireteams, engagements, quests, gamemodes, and more that often ‚Äúforce‚Äù you out of a comfort zone - so you‚Äôre on your way to being good at Warlock because you aren‚Äôt in a comfort zone.
---
Iron banner turns us all into the ultimate teammates.  I don‚Äôt remember the last time I captured a zone, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been out of eye sight of heavy for the past 10 games, pop a bubble on heavy every time I have it and when I‚Äôm unfortunate enough to not get heavy I sit down and let the enemy that did get it blow me up. And doesn‚Äôt help that I know I‚Äôve killed 16 enemies with rockets, yes I‚Äôve been keeping count, but the quest has only tracked 9.
---
So many thing is going on in this picture. Wrf?

I‚Äôve been really getting into the lore lately, and but is one of my favorite YouTubers a now! Also I have been going for the chronicler title, I‚Äôm a bit past halfway right now, just waiting for the flash point to be on tangled shore so I can do the machinist heroic adventure.

Honestly guiding light ruins ghost shell variation because I can‚Äôt justify not running that perk.

Probably the best PvP perk in-game right now.

Mnkke sorry if I misspelled that but they most certainly can because it happens to me consistently also people saying use the last word I said they dominate mid range to mid long not close so that argument is irrelevant.

‚ÄúI solo‚Äôd in a team co-op mode and it made me sad‚Äù is the oldest and dumbest complaint. This is 100% in your power to fix entirely. You never have to see a blueberry ever again if you make the minimal effort to leverage the many advantages easily available to you.

Slug shotguns only fire one big slug.  Pellet shotguns fire multiple pellets per shot.  For slugs, people may use them in pve but they're mostly used in pvp. Pellet shotguns are widely used in both.

A PC? Damn, for my 10th birthday all I got was a 3D printer.

Nova Warp itself is a pretty bad super. Astrocyte makes it passable, but putting yourself into shotgun range and having to charge up for a good second is a fantastic way to eat a shotgun blast to the dome.

Handheld Supernova on the other hand...

Well keep in mind how tall your character actually is. The top of the Titan only has to touch your toes, and they can jump to do so

And who started portraying them as that?  Hunters. Let me put it this way. The real life people who are behind those keyboards and controllers are just as smart as everyone else.

I didn't realize that was a thing.  I'm trying to Arbalest my way through so I can work on two things at once but I guess not.
---
AA is actually very fun
---
Just rockets and yes, everyone knows people are going for the heavy big time so it‚Äôs good bait.
---
That‚Äôs what she wants you to think...
---
Gambit has always had power level advantages in invasions.
---
It really doesn't. I play ib solo. Get heavy majority of the time while capturing points and slaying people. The only people who have to camp heavy will either never get a kill with it, or is just bad. But that's ok cuz I enjoy sniping :)
---
My first big brain pls i need it
---
Nice now what your mean thanks for the response

Can you yeet EP bosses or any other large yellow bar off the the map with a measly pike. 
---
No I don‚Äôt think you can
---
Heavy Pikes can do some good stuff, but normal pikes can't yeet knight to heaven and beyond.

This image came from bungie's website that let you access your weapons and armor in browser.

Keep spamming fast travel until it works.

on thier own sure but they look so out of place with the rest of my build

Weird flex

Sorry, shouldn't have worded it like that, didn't mean to come off like a dick. All I'm tryin to say is that you have to realize your point is totally subjective and doesn't serve any purpose other than to spread negativity. All I'm sayin is there's enough people outside the community who hate on the game. Do we really need more people in the community hating on it too? Like if you don't like the arms, then go play wow or the division or somethin' dude. Cuz i think the tangled web arms are dope.
---
I don't know what's up with the downvotes. Titans got their way with shoulder charge, now the other classes have one hit abilities. People are acting like OEM wasn't op forever. If they want to be fair, bring back Wormhusk to what it once was and the warlock melee range. Then Titans can have their OEM where it was.
---
That icebreaker though.
---
I produce music a lot and it sprung 3 of my programs at ya time, I might be pushing the limits but wow it‚Äôs great.
---
Bruh, you must just have like the biggest brain and be just the most popular coolest guy ever if you can slay an army of fools with a nova ray. That's just so cool. Omg. I want to be you for haloween. Send me a pic so i can make a costume of my hero (FireReaper333, lol)
---
He is not sensoring the score in any way
---
Titans where never on top ... You do realize that out of 100 people playing destiny 2 60 are hunters, thn 30 warlocks and then 10 Titans...  those 90 people where crying on every forum and redit how OP OEM is/was and how broken SS is. while actually 80 % of the time they get killed by other hunters and warlocks.
---
Now they get  throwing knives with the hitbox size of sequoia trees, and instagib grenades , and everything is balanced :D
---
I totally get what you're trying to say but Bungie listens to thier fans and I am a huge fan of the game been playing since d1 beta. I just want hte game to improve more like it has been
---
jymyzy: "You were my brother Dresser! I loved you!"
---
Diedser: *angry iron banner boogaloo noises*
---
And restores your class and melee ability
---
I guarantee it's Titan mains that are down voting. They didn't mind when they were top of the totem pole, but then they lose their shit when they get knocked down a peg or two.
---
Shadowkeep is the update that made the 750 light starting point. 
---
From 750-900 it should take an evening if you are playing 4-5 hours. That's not a bad grind. 900-960 however will take you some time due to hos the drops work now. And 960-970 is pretty pointless but will take you weeks.
---
It's an annoying step but it's doable solo. Use a good super and save it for when you're trying to grab heavy, try and get there like 10 seconds before it's up and pop your super to secure it. Titans use bubble, warlock bottom tree dawnblade, hunter golden gun to fend people away from it.
---
Then use wardcliff if you have the catalyst. Also run rocket scavenger on solar legs so if someone happens to drop a heavy brick and you can get it, you get two rockets instead of one. I was getting atleast 2 kills per game that way, more if you run with a whole team from LFG that is on the same step as you and works together to secure heavy.
---
I personally don't try and dodge rockets to get other people that are on that step the kill after I'm done with it on the character I'm using
---
It‚Äôs not a bug.  It‚Äôs a feature! Lol
---
I mean he did go hand to hand with a cabal and won.
---
*hits head against wall* There. Are. Work. Arounds. Please. Stop. Complaining. You. Entitled. Children.
---
Not everyone has Shadowkeep.
---
The objective doesn't say "camp this heavy for maybe one kill". It doesn't require you to camp heavy for any longer than the time it spawns. Should quests never be more complicated than "get kill" just so people don't think too hard and mess up a game?
---
Thank you :)
---
If you are on ps4, i can confirm that you can set your clock back 1 hour for it to work the first time. Then you can turn the time back and itll work
---
I disagree. I got to 969 with those being the main power boosts.
---
Yeah, I've been trying to tell people he's nowhere near Greek but they see the thing on his helmet and assume that indicates his nationality
---
Yes includes the season but not the season pass. Original Shadow keep gave everyone the season pass for Season of Undying. But that is over.
---
wait?! i didnt know they had one on titan. is that a glitch or a foreshadow ?
---
Then that's their problem.
---
Wait why I'm hearing the Soviet anthem?
---
No offense, but if you have two teams of equal skill with the score close, the team that controls heavy is going to win.
---
"Good players" also normally enjoy winning, which normally requires heavy control.
---
What is this, runescape?
---
You can buy the pass for 1000 silver wich is 10‚Ç¨/$
---
I set my ps4s clock a few hours back and now I never have an issue
---
On Xbox one, it says "Season Pass for season of dawn" I bought the Upgrade edition today
---
Zavala is why Titans are cowards. Spend all their time hiding behind walls and too afraid to fight. Saint 14 is a true Titan. The Titan of Titans. Saint 14 fought his way out of the Infinite Forest. Zavala would've just laid down and died.
---
You forgot the part where Hawthorne had ti save his sorry ass.
---
Shit I'm just trying to catch up on these tedious obelisk bounties. Not even close to enough time to do this Iron Banner.
---
They kinda already did with Sanguine alchemy and Foetracer.
---
Again, you are blaming people playing poorly on a quest step. It is not the quest step's fault that people don't understand that you don't need to be next to heavy until it spawns.
---
Yes, Bungie should be catering exclusively to the lowest common denominator, just like Y1 Destiny 2, which we can all agree was the Best Year Ever for Bungie and Destiny.
---
Probably would have been faster to sample 26 letters and use that as an alphabet but you do you
---
It's just rng. However the battle pass will drop base 64-66 armor pieces for each class this season. That's 76-78 masterworked, plus whatever mods you add.
---
The deluxe edition contained all of the season's passes but that doesn't exist anymore. You can only buy the passes each by each when they start. Maybe idiot microsoft just idiot.
---
You should contact Microsoft/Xbox live agents tomorrow. 
---
If you bought wrong one, they might be able to help. Like, refund, you delete and buy right edition.
---
I'm down. Shit would be awful but fuck it let's go
---
It works fine
---
That would have been lazy, and would have ruined the whole point of the meme.
---
So when you buy shadowkeep it does not include the season pass for season of dawn? Because if so imma storm Microsoft HQ
---
How do you even get better at crucible cause whenever I play I just get stomped by literally everyone on the enemy team.
---
The stag is underrated give it a try
---
It happens when u load into a game and there are empty spots on each side
---
i just went and dismantled a skull dire of amkhara or however you spell it from my warlock, it gave me an ascendant shard back
---
System? Also try r/fireteams
---
Titan needs a raid
---
Must perch!
---
It says " Destiny 2: Shadowkeep includes a digital copy of the game and a single Season Pass, providing exclusive activities and rewards. "
---
"and a single season pass" which was for the previous season.
---
It was only true for the Season of Undying.
---
The drop chance is very low, just did got the ikelos shotty today myself after 10-12 runs.
