All gud I just happened to restart my Ganesh and try one of the least costing bounties and It worked
---
I found him EARLY this morning.  But thank you for making sure I knew!  It’s likely someone will see this comment and not have known.
---
No land beyond? Anyone?
---
Yep, also xur would never sell the damn thing. That was just a pain.
---
Yeah I guess. I know I don’t have the best internet but it hasn’t ever been this bad. Yeah you’re right I’m probably just on the bad end of the servers. Thanks I just had heard about a couple issues with the season stuff (for example the EDZ) and didn’t know if this had been an issues or something.
---
Lol that was something I didn’t think of. That’s funny though.
---
Me too. Like an avalanche of avalanches.
---
I legit thought you were trying to just mess with people. Nah, you got a point. Would you say Warlocks are bottom Tier for PvP because it's rare to really utilize the class ability and have a fun loadout without becoming a meta slave?
---
Nvm
---
how do people see this and upvote it
---
I restarted my game and it workwd
---
Yep it worked thanks
---
i’m calling the nine
---
I used bad omens, trust, and some random auto rifle.
---
Sweet, glad I could help.
---
It’s just that when servers are bad on top of bad internet it’s, let’s say, double the issues and connection problems which is quite noticeable
---
To be fair, for new lights theres nothing that tells them you can turn PEs heroic. None that im aware of anyway. But when youre new and playing cause its fun youre not gonna go and start researching stuff, thatd become overwhelming very fast.
---
Didn’t say that, nor am I thinking it. 
---

---
Personally, I thought it was good. But the point myself and others are trying to make is that it’s been posted already, as have a ton of the other memes going around. That’s fine and dandy that he doesn’t read Reddit and cane up with it on his own. Point is, someone else already did it and posted it. After that, reposts just clog up the feed.
---
Dude... “on their own”. Maybe not be a simpleton and judge things on different angles?
---
Yes
---
yes, going into orbit and starting over, and also simply loading the mission again
---
no matter what i do whenever i get to this point this happens
---
:)
---
I main a Titan. Titan strong, Titan punch.
---
If Bungo adds red death back, they should have Red Spectre as a quest weapon(like Rose)
---
Whatever train that's heading straight to him you can guarantee that anyone in board won't survive the collision.
---
This definitely made me lol. Upvote issued
---
4 STACK META WHORES is the best way to describe them
---
With the Catalyst it hits very hard too. Go Titan and combo it with Stronghold for full on memes.
---
... dying?
---
I have over 25,000 kills on my Sunshot but that has been my main hand cannon since CoO and it’s mostly pve kills

Honestly I've been a little afraid to start raiding since I came back, haven't done one yet. But I have the first few steps for Izanagi's complete already (although I had no idea that's what the box was for and have been sleeping on continuing it) so that's good to know before I try to join a group.

I see you must be  g a y

Damn you cabal

Dumb Titans, eating crayons like a bunch of apes.

*Takes a long huff of paint to keep floating*

Ah that's what Papa Warlock needed.

Can someone expain me this ;-;

Everyone here: “tIdDy bAd”

*What they do not realise is that that makes them* **g a y**
---
Python and 21% aren't Gambit weapons, it means ones that drop from gambit
---
You clutched that so hard that you gave shaxx a stroke at the end
---
He's a big guy. That and would you want to tell him otherwise? After seeing what he did post leaving the forest. I'm gonna accept being 'small' to him.
---
I heard he finally sold it *after* they nerfed it. But I had already quit so I can't say that's true or not.

Well I must say I changed class and spent over 100 hours trying to get that fucking "amazing helmet" and still haven't got it all my quests are now on this cunt I wanna play some fucking warlock
---
Do the owoken queen responding to this in the same format
---
there was a taken armor set in D1.  one of my faves
---
The Postmasters really don’t get as much attention as they deserve
---
It’s a play on the jokes about the marine core being really strong, but also really dumb.
---
I mean you do realize it’s possible for people to find humor in things you don’t?
---
This is the way.
---
Thank you for correcting my dyslecsia.
---
-she then punches her sister and eats 5 crayons at a time. 
---
Merry Christmas y’all! See you out there! Let’s kill some aliens together this holiday season!
---
Yeah! Wipe those smiles off your face! None of that V “fun” shit ‘round here you maggots!
---
But why 64 crayons?
---
Was trying to be funny.
---
Oh well. I’ll just have to wait for stuff to die down a bit.
---
Yup. My main aesthetic. Scored Baron robes.
---
Because it’s well deserved. Titans are given training wheels as opposed to the other classes. Spoiler alert: I play Titan.
---
Because the playerbase is majority Hunter who eat this shit up like they portray Titans eating crayons. Seems like an expression of frustration to dying to "low kill" Titans with shoulder charge/OEM. Had hoped it would die off after the OEM nerf, but they rely too much on the symbology.
---
There's no constructive commentary to make on it. Eventually you stop coming to this subreddit for discussion, just medium to low effort memes/karma farming.
---
Thats fair. Its just rough having the lowest armor super invthe game. (Excluding golden gun because it has 0 arnor)
---
I am his favorite guardian. But you propably knew that because he tells everyone.
---
You mean a pain in the ass with those hadium flakes ,still get flashbacks
---
Your mum on deez nuts
---
All hunters
---
This is really dark.. mom? Dad?
---
Have you considered crayon curry. That stuff slaps harder than a shoulder charge to the face.
---
What AbOUT tITanS eAtiNG CRayOns!!! Lolololol
---
I agree but have you ever been into League of Legends... oh boy
---
Pretty sure that warlock doesn't mind if that Hunter eyes... Wonders a bit.
---
*Distant Ara Ara*
---
Tbh I'm kind of a noob about this game, could explain to me what you mean?
---
This just reminds me why I love top tree Dawn blade.
---
Whether we intended to or not, we've walked into a battle with the Cabal on Mars, so let's begin to destroy their command, one at a time.
---
This is a big problem I'm having now.
---
uh you sure dodging is gonna save me from being catapulted across the map
---
As far as PVP is concerned Walocks have their strengths and weaknesses.
---
Rifts aren't meant to be placed as a saving grace in a firefight.
---
They're meant for support for you and your allies. Place them before you start getting shot at, not after.
---
It's not up to bungie to make the classes fair, it's up to us players to spit in the face of fairness and dominate regardless of any shortcomings.
---
Lackluster Melee? Pack a shotgun.
---
To slow in the air? Don't jump 50 ft above the map .
---
Redjacks serving as bodyguards obviously, ya pee-can.
---
Eris Morn
---
Used to use it with ramp up and old rally barricade in Gambit. Poor mans Sweet Buisness.
---
I mean technically there could be child guardians so...
---
Update please when painted! Looks great
---
To beat the enemy, you must think like the enemy -some shit Confucius probably said
---
Though it’s probably the only way to counter fusions ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ beat them at their own game or become a 420blazeitFaZeclan snipe god. Or don’t fight them in medium encounters
---
But insane hitscan that can bump me out of super immediately. I find myself trading with them more often than not.
---
You spent the whole time laughing about how dumb it was. 
---
Now imagine if you didn’t want it to be dumb.
---
Can I just say that. I get your toaster is crappy. But it has settings. Your probably on 1 or 2. Crank that shit to like 5 or 6.
---
It’s only available a few times a season.
---
Kill people with a grenade launcher. 
---
And put your actual topic in your title.
---
Yeah golden gun i think doesnt need armor at all. Its so strong as it is
---
Hippity Hoppity this repost is someone else’s property
---
Bungie, make it happen!
---
i actually made the switch from titan to hunter
---
don’t have it
---
Neither does blade barrage. It's so annoying when I pop super on top of the. And they use their immediate "get out of jail free" card.
---
Well, kinda three of them. Of course, the other two seeking ones aren’t too good.
---
This repost is like 2 weeks old
---
It's a random drop by slaying enemies and stuff. Play the game, pray to RNG, and maybe Santa, and you'll get one eventually.
---
Is it possible to learn this power
---
Fml the knockback hitbox of the Taken Phalanx shield attack is like 3-4x the size it seems
---
There is a ummm, *looks around* rule 34 destiny subreddit around here somewhere.
---
That and the pvp portion is why I never got any of those swords.
---
I got to 5000 but can’t break that, right now I’m sitting around 4750. I can get 1.0 against basically any team but I just can’t really clutch or make outstanding plays. 
---
I’m sure it’ll click one day and I’ll hit legend but I’ve ran into so many sweats as of late
---
Dont forget the constant posts of baby yoda.
---
I DONT fucking care about that corporate marketing goblin just let the meme die like the OEM meta plehehease...
---
What drawing programm do you use that brush looks so good

Oh I didn't know that. Thank you!

I sort of miss it, but I’ve always like doctrine of passing better.

Laughs in pre nerf spectral blades

1. He has a wife?

2. If you hadn’t mentioned the cheek clapping part I would not be suffering right now
---
Once per character per week
---
you forgot shaxx
---
Nobody's. We dance emote and become great friends. Way of the Warlock!
---
что за хрень
---
Remember when having a sword was a symbol of status?
---
No friends... And what about your raid team
---
Time to grind bright dust again I guess
---
It knew it’s inferior dance moves would not be enough to match the skill of the random hairdos , so they committed alt+f4
---
That’s exactly what he’s doing all day.
---
He could have been for me, but man.. I already defeat the Red Legion yet he is still going all REEEEEEEEEE in the tower about the Cabal. Guy cant give me a fucking break.
---
Right in the feels
---
Thank you for reminding me about that pain ,was lucky enough to get all 3 ,definitely worth it in the end
---
Someone Else said that, I hadn’t noticed, sorry.
---
I camp people at vendors and wait to hit them
---
True evil is oem Titans or skullfort shoulder warriors
---
Dual speed receiver is where it's at. The thing fires as steady as a sewing machine. Leave the ammo dumping to SB. Such beautiful guns....they are my Wolverine's photo.
---
It happens sadly, I was sat at 4400 for over a week last season before I had a massive win streak to legend rank. With how matchmaking is ATM its all teamplay with some luck on who your opponents are.
---
If you're already 5k glory then you'll make it to legend, just dont give up
---
Nice
---
I get lost in walmart...
---
You need to get a lot of sg kills in gambit
---
Uhhhhh. Fundamental problems here. First, neither of those things are big hammers. See the damage equation for destiny is (V•D•*v*)^H= damage output. (V = volume, D = density, *v* velocity, H = amount of hammer, measured in hammers) You have the first part (V•D•*v*) but you lack the hammers. All I suggest is, eat the crayons rich in sea foam coloration. Makes mind strong.

117?? Omg

A helm of St.14 bubble would put them in a panic.  Ofc you'd need a bit more time.
---
This is my favorite thing I’ve ever seen on reddit
---
All the D1 raid weapons were so amazing, I miss VoC the most probably
---
Nah man, they had the exotic flavors. Gold, cyan, even fricken peach!
---
Hero’s never die!!!
---
They removed the exotic rewards from the first 3 campaigns.
---
Cant go 5 minutes without seeing another dumb crayon joke. You'd think the "Smart" classes wouldn't take 5 years to come up with another joke

Once you beat a raid

Your beautiful beautiful horn.

Yellow is always a mixed bag. Sometimes it’s banana, other times it’s fucking ***lemon***.

What’s special about it?

Legit question, do reports do anything ?
---
Grind to 960 power next.
---
Thats exactly what I just said..
---
Confirming your doubt.

Nice.

Hey that’s me!

It's a trials hint.

Trials of the Pigeon.

Best recommendation I can give is start with a sherpa group for your first run, They are usually very forgiving as they know what they are getting themselves into. Get at least 1 clear done or until you feel comfortable enough to play with people that might not have as much patience as a sherpa.
---
Speech: 100
---
I love that image. I'd like it on a helmet. Kinda like Emile's in Reach.
---
why did you post this dog shit 3 times
---
 You just never quit do you? Took out Ghaul. Woke up the traveller. And now half of what I hear on the streets is how much you and your clan are making a difference. And that's why I started this whole clan thing in the first place y'know. People are still waiting for the vanguard to lead the way. It's time for a change! And guardians like you are making it happen. No pressure[.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qY30_hCQZOI)
---
Just doing the same old stuff like events and strikes?
---
Every day its like "tf did we do now?"
---
I can't be the only one who didn't like Hawkmoon.
---
After 900 power just do anything that gives powerful gear, strikes are included in that.
---
Copy that. Thanks!
---
That is not what this page says: https://www.bungie.net/7/en/pcmove
---
People on [this](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/253948919?sort=0&amp;page=0) thread have the same issue and i cannot find an official statement on how to fix it by Bungie.
---
They supposedly act as anchor points for the timeline, so that nothing important gets fucked up when we use the sundial.
---
Exotic special ammo sword when? Additional exotic kinetic sword when? Three sword loadout when? 
---
I want this so much
---
Made my night with that comment, thank you.
---
Destiny 2 only guardian here trying to figure out what was so good about gallahorn ( however it was spelled )

Fair just didnt recognize it

I bought both and yes, im also a newlighter in destiny 2, and i suugest to buy both dlc

---
I’m gonna be honest, I think the Destiny universe is expansive enough to have more melee weapons. I would absolutely love this game even more if they made more unique weapons like the sword. I guess bows are already a thing but they’re pretty underwhelming
---
Was this ironic?
---
What if I use MIDA and a random shotgun because I don't have any of those guns
---
What do you mean by double shoulder charge, if i may ask?
---
It was used in PvP a bit when Bungie removed special weapon ammo from spawn. You had to pick up special ammo like heavy, or it dropped when an enemy died. With Icebreaker, you just gained ammo for free, making it a popular choice in PvP for a while
---
 Easy fix: top hammers, synthoceps, solar plexus, 1 2 punch = easy one bang for most of every champion
---
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into another with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one.
---
This is how we solo the next raid boss.
---
I wish there was a subreddit for Cayde-6, lord sallidin, and maybe The Drifter
---
970+. Must have clears. KWTD. Must have izanagi with catalyst and emblem
---
I still respond with the classic “ur mom”
---
Very much so
---
r/no
---
Once you can properly build your character for raids and 980 stuff without just doing what a guide said to do then youre good. Honestly i think people take the whole "veteran" thing too far. So many of them are still ass at the game. Theyve just been playing along time and want to hold on to something
---
YOU BEST not bring that into crucible, I've got enough PTSD from the sound of that thing /s
---
Seriously though congrats man glad you're enjoying the game
---
X3
---
A few Hunters killed Bracus Zahn with exclusively Tripmines stuck to a single sparrow they brought through the entire strike.
---
I'll say it extra loud for the boys in the back.
---
# THE FIRST CURSE
---
This made me move my masseters. Here, take it *hands an upvote*, you deserve
---
But how do you nerf something like that without affecting it’s usefulness in PvE? Bungie need to completely separate PvP and PvE balancing, otherwise we’ll just have to accept things like Blade Barrage in the Crucible, or we risk neutering it in PvE.
---
It was fine until hunters weren't the most powerful ones anymore, then they threw a hissy fit and started calling titans "crayon eaters" and acting like it was only idiots that played the class. It was all just inter-coass fun until hunters took it too seriously and started legitimately hating anyone that didn't play their class
---
It goes without saying obviously not all hunters do this, but since hunters are the most common class, they tend to have more dickheads
---
I was getting crushed last season in high level comp because all i got for teammates were smooth brains. Still hit 5500 though.
---
Stereotypes, hunters are cocky, warlocks are smart, and Titans go punch
---
Eh. It was fair. Sure, you sit back with no worry of running out of ammo. But, you have to sit there waiting for the very slow regen (after they nerfed it). Ultimately, it was a considerably slow cheese.
---
You've outdone op
---
I guess it’s come full circle then bc in y1 dawnblade was able to tank a hammer or two
---
Yeah dude totally, you were just kidding. Definitely.
---
You got any red crayons?
---
Yeah lol. I love leveling up the classes. I’m not a fan of the leveling in 2. My solar class is nowhere near having resurrection.
---
Don't you know? The cloak functions as blanket for two.
---
Now try saints
---
I should say I don't mean cosplaying as a vex is silly. Just that this implementation wasn't what I personally would hope for. The vex foot is pretty great I can't argue with that, cape is great too.
---
Use the "play of the game" granade launcher with proximity rounds. The one you can pull from collections has it. Proximity rounds are key to success tbh.
---
It's almost like getting to the top usually involves using the best possible loadouts for it. 
---
Though honestly there are better options than recluse now. 
---
Hell, better snipers than revoker and better hand cannons assuming that double bullet issue isn't around anymore.
---
Ouch the find your gonna have
---
He’s running bottom tree tho :(
---
With the longest cooldown and a very limited range. Give me invis with tether all day bro
---
It's all part of the same design philosophy as having to compete with your fireteam for final blows to get bounties: Making you despise everyone else playing the game for no reason.
---
Honestly the special planetary rare materials were worse than the Hasidim flakes. At least you kind of knew where to get the flakes. The planetary mats were complete RNG.
---
Dust rock blues...range and impact are hard to beat, easy world drop on Mars
---
Can you only do two a week? I feel like I’ve done four or five this week. I’m doing the giants might quest
---
No, its physically impossible. I've tried many times with 88k being the highest
---
Believe whatever you want, you're entitled to that.
---
I have one in my Vault actually. Thanks so much.
---
Great thank you.
---
Yup good luck
---
You want rose red or redneck red?
---
I’m 5’9” 175. Purely average. 
---
I once shook the hand of a Cincinnati Bengals lineman. Dude was 6’5” about 290. 
---
You could tell he was terrified of engulfing my tiny hands inside his gigantic mitts. It was one of the weakest handshakes I’ve ever had, because he was giving it about 10%. Lol
---
I can imagine seeing him get shot with a hunters Special and disintegrating into a million pieces lol
---
Truly, best gift one could receive on their cake day.
---
Against bad players this is true. Good opponents bop the fuck outta nova warp. At legend comp vs good teams I use the super to get rid of shutdown supers or control objectives. What my super does is roughly the same as a Titan barrier and a pulse nade
---
Hunter main, I'd consider using the other classes if their jumps weren't trash. 
---
Sorry.
---
Bruh people just say they are good cause they move around a lot. Like anyone who can aim half decently could clap them easily. Titans were broken af for the longest time and could 1 shot with a melee that fucking locked onto you from a mile away, warlocks had a 1 shot grenade on a short ass cooldown, and both had supers that lasted forever.
---
I main hunter and they were deff the weakest. I honestly don't know how anyone thinks they weren't the worst class
---
You can only do two legendary frames a week, which you need to do in order to progress the Jotuun quest.
---
I always thought the “crayon-eater” thing was a dumb joke, not an actual insult. There are people who are obnoxious about it but I think the bigger problem is people generalizing classes or misunderstanding one another.
---
I just think any kind of hostility as extreme as I’ve been seeing is a little uncalled for between players in a community. Lately this place has been reminding me of how toxic league of legend’s community is.
---
I mean, if we going there, Malfeasance 5 taps from the exact opposite corner of the map if you can hit them-
---
Is that handheld supernova cause it's currently my only strat
---
How do you get unlimited super, what!
---
Any red would do thanks
---
Just tried it, it's not working for me
---
I've gotten like 99k a couple times there's certain ordeals you can cheese it, look it up
---
It's also not working for me.
---
Killed by the architects
---
I miss soloing with it for nightfalls in Y1, solar burn with a VoC, Black Hammer and Gally was just awesome
---
If you were looking for comfort food, at Walmart I saw some crayons for half price
---
He didn't even recognise me...
---
Hey hold on... my post in the first place was about how the grenade, meaning the handheld, should damage yourself at point blank range... WOW! I know right! It happens to all other grenades, so what makes the handheld special?
---
This guy doesn’t know what he’s talking about. It should be higher than S+. Possibly just an infinity symbol. I also happen to know for a fact that he has a mangina.
---
I am Mythic 3 and i need about 2-3 wins to get fabled. Help would bevery appreciated.
---
I mean that if you leave right when it's over, you don't always get drops. You have to wait for like 4 seconds. Know what I mean?
---
Only cause wishender is bugged now though.
---
Nothing is underrated in destiny. There are things that are really good but arent used simply because there are better alternatives. I could easily run izanagi and a spike nade launcher and get much better efficiency in any activity. I really like running 1k voices. Its really strong. But its not great because it wastes a slot.
---
Apparently the Joke Police Gods have decided that this meme is now dead. Get fucked everyone.
---
tfw the hammer explodes just as you reach it...😫
---
I'm a hunter, and I respect all titans as the master race they are. I mained Titan in D1 anyway.
---
I think Xenophage should be higher, minimum in Rank C (if it receives another good buff would be a B). I thought it was a shitty weapon but i entered Gambit and it changed my mind. In crucible it’s not as good as other weapons but it a bit useful, in my opinion
---
rarely expected. similar encounter when i was going to tower after doing crucible matches (im ass at pvp) and i got the monte carlo.
---
You seem stressed, but don't you worry. I've got some nice, warm vex milk and a 64 pack with all the fancy colors that should help you unwind.
---
Personally I think you can't really combine a PvE and pvp their list which is why you see so much disagreement. Like the smgs probably should be moved up
---
Skeletor is an auto upvote from me
---
Yo, sick threads.
---
Please, please, yes! I’m almost the- fffboom
---
Meanwhile I'm just trying to figure out how to sculpt and not make my poly count go through the roof
---
You forgot about recluse
---
I enjoy throwing them way too much tbh. Probably cause I almost never get snow where I live. Love Texas to death, just wished Central Texas got some actual snow.
---
You can always infuse it and make its higher light go up
---
Been there... What a wild time that was...
---
"Comp match" nah bruh theres 6 stacks going into classic mix more than comp.
---
Or a 20. You don’t know what his goals where. Maybe he wanted to end up in a Reddit post.
---
I tiered WishEnder ignoring the current bug. I think C is a good rating because it's doesn't do much other then it being a high damage Bow
---
Tractor Cannon might be okay with the new shotgun charged with light builds people are using, I made this list before that became popular. Other then that it really got hurt with the changes and is overall barely used in my opinion
---
I don't really see a purpose to use Vow over any sniper, especially when there are crazy DPS snipers that can be paired with Anarchy to produce more damage. It's a better PVP weapon in my opinion, but even then I don't think it's better then an actual special weapon or sniper
---
Thanks for commenting!
---
Also why is every titan meme a OEM? Ugliest useful helmet imo
---
It's a common phrase, especially in fictional narrative, where there is an almost identical version of a leading character. They look oddly similar, with some slight differences, and have a radically different morality to the familiar protagonist.
---
Still makes it higher than where it’s at right now.
---
Well yes, but actually no
---
Needs to be normal nightfall strikes, the ones on the far right.
---
Oh... thanks
---
Go to collections, weapons, click on heavy and then swords. 
---
You can find it there

True, if you wanted to get more boss DPS, Izanami + Spike Nades is great! But I strongly believe for any other activity, Anarchy is better for the reasons i listed above. Eitherway thanks for commenting!
---
no idea too.
---
everyone got wish ender???
---
Do I need to complete the curse of Osiris campaign as well
---
Welcome
---
Shut up
---
The comment above yours does not appear to be underrated.
---
We would like to thank you for your vigilance and encourage you to continue rating comments.
---
Just picked up a Fullbore/Accurized/Outlaw/Multikillclip  range MW
---
Effing finally
---
Ngl we're not smart but we have fun
---
I personally think that if something excels in one category and sucks in the other it should be placed accordingly. Like you said it being S in PvP but like D or E in PvE should place it in B.
---
Ace of Spades, on the other hand, is used a lot in both modes and is extremely effective. That's why I believe it should be higher.
---
*Redeposit* 
---
I’m stealing this phrase. Hope you don’t mind 
---
Kthxbyeeeeee
---
because LoW is a titans armor, gotcha 👍🏻
---
He went flawless and got a chest piece.
---
But it being the top of its class in pvp holds more weight then being average in pve hence why its a.
---
I disagree. An average of two values is equally affected by both values. Sort of like a GPA.
---
Ozimozes (or whatever spelling) I find to pretty awesome. Allows your primary to have a changeable damage type.
---
That's some negativity we don't need here
---
Nyooom
---
I understood that reference
---
I am a warlock. I have similar feelings about hunter and titan.
---
Everything can be countered. Hunters are not invincible mid dodge and most are not good enough to not he sitting ducks while jumping around. Even if there's a disadvantage, its so damn negligable if you know how to make the best of what you have that its pointless to look at it. Do warlocks need tuning and get shafted compared to titans and hunters? Absolutely. Does that mean that its a hardcore disadvantage like you make it seem? Nope. Hard exaggeration. They need to be brought up to speed yes, but no need to develop a victim complex for warlocks too. I know titans love to throw the word on other classes whilst whining themselves but lets not go on a crayon diet just yet.
---
Warlock kit isnt bad. Top tree dawnblade right now has me playing warlock more than hunter due to its double icarus dodge every five seconds and not just when my feet are touching the ground. Its basically packing the hunter moveset onto a warlock tree but midair too. Its quite lovely. Novawarp needs a buff.cuz its.laughable. The arc trees are fine, the palpatine fingers have quite a decent range a fast ttk, chaos reach tree is perfect to shutdown supers, novabomb is novabomb. Since the removal of shattered nova that whole thing had been eh to me but it has its uses. Dawnblade cant skate anymore, least not on bottom tree making the tree useless so that def needs a rework (lets yeet it.out and bring.back radiance if you ask me), and if youre bringing mid tree into pvp, the most pve super ever, then its not the class to blame.
---
And even THEN it has its uses, just expect a striker to kill everyone in your well. Which you could argue that it sucks that the bubble doesnt have that problem and they should act the same but then 1, its just a carbon copy of bubble but better in every way because 2, you can fire out of it. If you bring mid tree dawn into pvp youre bringing it for the neutral support game not for its super.
---
So again, warlocks need tuning yes. But they are far from being bad or making playing warlocks hardcore mode.
---
If they kill off shaxx i will riot
---
Few days ago i threw a snowball at a random in the tower, he then decided to throw a snowball on me and we had a snowball fight, then a few seconds later another random came and threw snowballs at us and then we danced
---
Destiny really is wholesome
---
What about divinity then, thats like a c in pvp but an a in pve and yet its an A class weapon, ace is essentially a slightly worse sunshot imo, the only thing going for it is the range and even that isn’t that different post range nerf.
---
I don't know anything about Divinity as I never got it. But if it's an A in PvE and a C in PvP then it should be a B weapon.
---
Also you have sanguine alchemy and empowering rift with max recov for wallhacks every 40ish seconds
---
Can anyone link the original post so i can upvote and save it.
---
Depends on what activity you're doing and what perks you want to use, here's a generally [good PVE roll](https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/db/items/1289997971-breachlight?perks=3330548924,202670084,3142289711,1168162263,2458213969,4248210736,2323986101,0,0,2285418970)
---
I have that nerf gun
---
*coghs loudly* WHAT ABOUT CAYDE *coughs loudly* 
---
I know I’m a stereotypical hunter but come on
---
AHAHAH I'm on my desk at work shouting 'yeah get em' evil laugh and all loool
---
Oh i forgot
---
~~what about khepri's horn~~ no wait, you said useful...
---
IS THIS AN ACTUAL CUTSCENE? I NEED TO ACCESS IT. 
---
# RIGHT NOW
---
Ha ha
---
You live by the sword, you die by the sword.
---
Oh yeah just noticed the shoulder charge
---
My work here is done
---
Crayon
---
Looooolllll
---
me too brother
---
shaxx shake hands only with 1% of his power.
---
We get it, you have sex
---
As far as I know you can get the class swords from Banshee's engrams or as a boss drop from the heroic menagerie. It sucks that there is no matchmaking in heroic menagerie though.
---
Yup, would have been cool to see riven when I get around to doing the raid instead of just popping in solo after viewing multiple YouTube videos of how to actually get to him.
---
I think seals are tied to your bungie account and just use vault or destiny mobile app to transfer items.
---
Dude I don’t even know how reddit works I just thought the clip was cool, and if it’s so easy, go do it yourself
---
Heavy Bird Man. I fucking knew thd Heavy and Saint were similar in a way.
---
I had emailed them back about it &amp; they told me that they didn't have a specified timeframe in december but it would be in december... Kinda worried since it's not December 24th &amp; still no email
---
Guess what, its another sweet biz
---
What new show?
---
Eater is by far the easiest, maybe tied with scourge, raid in the game btw, I'd try something harder before teaching and calling yourself a veteran
---
They gonna be pretty bummed when it gets decrypted into another Edge Transit.
---
I see you....
---
Y’all make fun of us titans.... until ya need us when there’s no cover, your dodges are recharging and you can’t hide, or about to die.
---
Really? That joke is such low effort, old and overused.
---
And then I laugh exactly like this lmao
---
Are you sarcastic ?
---
Never play again. It must not change!
---
&gt;Dodges are also about 10 more useful in pvp than barricades and rifts.
---
You say that with the confidence of a man who hasn't gotten his ribs todn out and throat severed by having his insides strung around them like a noose by some kill-joy running Revoker, Max Recovery Empowering Rift and Sanguine Alchemy for fucking wall hacks in 3v3, following you into every match for three fucking games ( what did I do to deserve this ). Quick search on YouTube revealed that this build was made by CammyCakes, and that I could've saved myself at least a little bit by getting 40 resilience, which prevents bodyshots from outright killing me.
---
Thank you, you fashionable asshole, I didn't want to play PvP anyway
---
You just put the whole sub in to one comment
---
Are you sure you're a hunter?
---
So should I not have shared it then? I just thought it was cool.
---
Thamks friend
---
But I was a New Light, then I learned how to RAID, and now I'm a veteran. It was really hard BTW. It took like six hours, so I wouldn't call it easy. If I am good enough to do it, I don't see the problem with me teaching.
---
Oh well. You specifically can go jump off a bridge. Preferably onto a freeway. Merry Christmas, dipshits.
---
Can’t tell if being serious or trolling 🤔
---
Oh c'mon! Make a new joke already!
---
No?
---
I do the same thing sometimes
---
Lol they put arc battery back in the game this season as void battery. Titans lost the one good artifact perk oppressive darkness and it wasn’t even for pvp. Warlocks got shit on again.
---
pm me if you want to... i'm sure i can arrange something if you want
---
Honestly, I think this weapon type restriction is good. Yes, it forces some weapons over the other, but it encourages people to try new weapon types. I never really liked pulse rifles before, but after playing with them in this season I started using them in crucible and now I consider myself pulse rifle main(Bygones is my love). If there was no restriction, I would've probably never gave any pulse a chance they deserve.  
---
Restriction makes us leave our comfort zone, makes us compromise with loadouts, but it is temporary and leads to experimentation with new weapons. It is better than running same old reliable pve build you have(everyone has their goto PvE loadout, I am sure).  
---
If every weapon type will do something with champions people will just stick with their favorite weapons, and just spit some mods on them for good measure without thinking much about it, no creativity, no incentive to try something new.
---
You need to list them so the curious minds (me) don’t spend too much time on google
---
Exactly
---
I'm just a guy who wanted to share his success story. That's all, why is everyone doubting my abilities?
---
Yeah back when nova warp was ridiculous
---
Shaxx wouldn't like this
---
Because clearing your first raid doesn’t make you a vet. In the eyes of the raid sherpas you’re still a scrub.
---
I mean holding m1 is easy, sure. But after the super nerf, deciding when to go for it can be tricky, and really calculating those blinks to avoid a super is solid. This isn't just a "hold w and m1" play.
---
The funny thing is, he was in his super. The map would have blinked with enemy nearby. I'd spam that swing...
---
Bruh now that you're a "vet" why not tackle the Garden of Salvation raid?
---
How about Ada, Eva, and Ana on Sheeva
---
I'm pretty sure this guy is trolling
---
Because Hunters thought that it'd be a good idea to hate Titans after they weren't stupidly fucking over powered anymore!
---
Déjà vu
---
Bungie: Which buffs do you want?
---
Guardians: *Yes*
---
First of all, I'm not a scrub. I cleared a RAID, so that should prove my abilities straight away. Second, it does make me a veteran, I'm no longer just a New Light, I've become good.
---
Because you don't like the majority of Hunters or because you want to get bullied for stupid shit?
---
We can still be friends, I don’t discriminate against other classes
---
it's like throwing an Incendiary Grenade at a Super and any hit, even one tick of damage, means their abilities are all shut down
---
but excessive imo
---
This!!!! Happens waaaaaay more than it should. I feel your pain!
---
Daddy shaxx
---
Wait you can lose infamy?
---
Purple slaps like a shoulder charge to the face. But green is always a good choice.
---
Dam it has 30
---
That’s so weirdddd.  I’ve seen a couple of guardians that look, similar to mine, but never an exact copy
---
Whine some more, maybe u get another OHK ability
---
I’ve had countless technically.
---
bro u just posted cringe
---
it is a bug and bungie is fixing it.
---
I'm not saying you're bad lol I'm just saying a double primary loadout like vanilla d2 is so boring. That titan having your back was funny though
---
I bet Telesto actually broke the EDZ Obelisk
---
The funny part is it wasn’t even a shotgun bounty, it was a solar bounty and the only solar weapon I had was mindbender so I threw it on for the first time in crucible ever😂
---
Wtf
---
If I feel Im carrying that hard I leave
---
If you get to the Super vs. Super time, you can counter theirs with a Supressor and make it Super vs. Non-Super. Tether is still Super vs. Super, you don't need a Super for a Sentinel to do the same
---
Worst rendition of wronski feint I've ever seen. Don't give up though, krum didn't become the best seeker in the world in a day.
---
I think it looks great Merry Christmas
---
Yeehaw chuckle fucks
---
Lose enough matches in a row, yes, you can. I usually save up enough Infamy boost bounties so all I need is a couple wins in Gambit at near max rank, and then use the bounties to max rank. The games are far too inconsistent in terms of odds of winning to try and win my way up to a reset.
---
Banshee-44 gets one
---
If hunters were so strong, cayde wouldn’t be dead
---
It's the other way around with me. I do well suddenly my 1v1 become a 5v1
---
I can’t possibly be the only guy who appreciates a Titan throwing themselves into the deep to revive my deadass in a 980, right?
---
I mean, I’m not the most PvP person around, I do participate so for the pinnacles and exotics, and when Saladin comes by, but I tend to appreciate the good side of the classes, how warlocks give up their super for a team signal flare signalling everyone to start their DPS, how Titans always had the most spectacular entrance (Terminal Velocity/ Thundercrash).
---
I do understand some of the frustration stem from the class, but I feel like some of the complaints comes from the tunnel-visioning on how “good/broken” a certain skill is while neglecting some other advantages their own class is having, or an edge that they are already utilising without even realising.
---
As a hunter I feel like the one punch man and the infinite health floating bitches can all shut up
---
*sensitive little girl* bro wtf and i could say the same for the entire subreddit but thats not how things work around here
---
Ok
---
Thanks! Appreciate the advice!
---
Hackers or all of them run teleston with the new mod, so infinte ammo.
---
So was vex offensive...
---
You do kills divided by efficiency gives you the deaths
---
Sundials great.
---
Oh... thanks.
---
😂😂😂
---
Lol why are you so mad. I guess your username says you’re salty
---
Titan punch?
---
I thought it is earlier. Thanks for the info.
---
Pretty sure you used the wrong symbol, should've used &lt;
---
No I’m implying that they were usually in the front lines in lore and had more of a knowledge in combat then the other classes due to the fact that they were in the front line
---
Its because their wimpy knives/(spells?) break when they hit something
---
Indeed you could this place in super cringe, people are in here acting like they are the actual guardians of earth
---
I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
This happens to every f2p game on steam. They make a second acc to avoid the ban on their main, and they’re set.
---
No
---
Thanks Shuxx
---
you know, sometimes this game makes me laugh, other times I want to break my console.
---
I love destiny.
---
From what I can tell, I've got a bunch from Bow and Scout kills, especially Precision hits.
---
Im not mad at all. Just pointing out that your karma farm isnt working and its cringe. Im trying to help you out
---
That'd be cool because I don't like him at all. I'd like to like him, but I just can't after he was such a dick concerning Cause.
---
why
---
Hacker dude doesn't even deserve to play imo.
---
No. This is my favorite game right now. Fuck everyone who tells me to leave the community for having a different opinion.
---
I agree all i want to see is fun or imteresting discussions and the occasional meme but all i ever see is classes getting mad at eachother for something not worth getting angry about
---
No need to kill him
---
Can someone explain this crayon thing to me?
---
Except how long is he going to need to unlock blue runes...
---
HUG INCOMING! Transmat firing!
---
If you cant beat them join them.
---
I am a part of this community and I have a different opinion. I am just as much in the right to express this as you all are to make shitty jokes. Don't give me that crap.
---
I can't decide on a main. 
---
I like Hunter...the other two classes feel like cheese imo.
---
But like...I enjoy cheese...
---
I started during the Solstice event this year, and I spent alot of time as a Warlock, and for this season I told myself I'd go Hunter.
---
With the Solar buffs I thought bottom tree golden gun was gonna be better...
---
I just think Hunter jump/class overall feels the most natural.
---
I think you're overreacting, it takes a lot of time to throw, if you start casting it in front of someone, they should kill you before you throw it. So in a lot of cases you have to cast it before meeting someone, which makes a kill not guaranteed.
---
I haven't played that class much in pvp, but I've got a lot of kills on people that didn't kill me on time or were in a predictable position when I cast the knive before seeing them.
---
How was he a dick? He held up the wishes of one of his closest friends in protecting humanity. If he were to start a war with the awoken cayde's life's work would be naught
---
Bottom tree Solar Titan with exotic legs and thermite grenade, OR same subclass with exotic chest and full super charged. Total mayhem with solar burn and grenade recharge.
---
That’s kinda how I played the hunter with Way of a Thousand cuts... I’ve cleared entire pve areas with just knives.
---
One thing is telling you to leave because your opinion is different, but I said that because you're having a toxic behaviour.
---
D2 is my favourite game too, and I've friends that live warlock and titan and don't like at all hunters. I'm a hunter main, and will I be mad at them? Of course not, I still okay with then and I love playing with them.
---
You, on the other hand, you're just being toxic just because you don't like titans
---
Molto Bene
---
Except for me it didn’t work even while I was the only person in the instance sooooo
---
Mmm vex milk
---
Sorry man I’m doing my best.
---
Guardians, but it doesn't have to be you killing them, it can be anyone on your team, randoms too
---
I love this. I verbally went “aww” 10/10
---
Thank you! :)
---
Yeah pisses me off
---
as a titans fan this hurts..
---
These were broke af in trials, didn't have to use they with just void, I used them with self Rez so I could start each round with a sticky nade
---
Well, darn.  I really hope there's at least a partial fix coming next reset.
---
I have a few of the large ones. The smalls are nice.
---
Not on Mercury per se, open Mercury and go to the sundial.
---
Man I don’t give a shit what exotic you use. You paid just as much as I did for the game!  Use whatever you want!  Don’t let mouth breathers on reddit dictate your play style.
---
“Ooh! Get out there and capture those zones, brother. That right there is a power play. You’ve got advantage.”
---
“Deposit your motes, Guardian. You want to earn glory, summon the primeval. 
---
“The envoys don’t stand a chance when you work as a team!”
---
Uuhhh lookin at your comments you *do* hate Titans. Also don't act so fucking superior and stuff. Look, maybe I am thin-skinned about this, but why should I just shut up? And *why* do Titans deserve this? I don't give a shit about anything else, just give me *one* single good reason Titans deserve to get bullied and Hunters or Warlocks don't?
---
It's a above average gun, I haven't seen anyone use it in a while.
---
I personally don't use it. I don't like pulse riffles and it's a exotic slot taken up. I mostly use izanagi's or world line zero (on my warlock).
---
As common as this hack is, it does not seem all that useful. If the enemy has a titan and its not survival, it only benefits the opposing team.
---
Special ammo finisher, all kinds of mods including “Pump Action” to fuel special ammo, two special shotguns and a tractor cannon, and you’ll be getting an easy 30-50 kills depending on your class and enemy types.  Bonus cool guy points for booping invaders into walls with the TC.
---
You are wrong
---
What i5 gen though? Also a nvidia 550 seems a bit too weak for this game aswell imo
---
Zero grenades and so many punches I was afraid my bumper was gonna break off... again
---
You can absolutely panic melee someone now with throwing knife. A titan can’t panic melee someone either unless they’ve been sprinting and are using a tree with shoulder charge which bottom tree striker is the most popular and doesn’t include it.
---
Thank you for the encouragement
---
Thats supposed to be fixed, but some of the newer ones aren't in his loot pool
---
It’s especially confusing because it’s only the edz one, at least for me and what looks to be most people
---
I take them from tower and I have been doing Paradox only, so maybe the obelisk ones are capped at 4.
---
Admittedly, probably not. But I'm sure as hell reporting him.
---
Didn’t he kill guardians while stealing supplies from a crucible shipment?
---
Mate. Have you not read the lore of how he made the Derelict? Or even the Dark Age guardians he shot down?
---
He probably actually got it from ifunny and is too ashamed to admit it lol.
---
I saw it once. It my favor lol. We start. He teleports and kill them all. They respawn and he kills them again. Shaxx go bananas because 'we killed them' so fast. Repeat. Thanks for the easy glory points
---
I feel quests that force you to be a detriment to your team shouldn’t be in the game.
---
Greatness
---
If I were ever to switch classes. Would totally be a titan. Love mid tree striker
---
Is... is that love? Idk, I've never had someone love me
---
I've been in the same boat since i took it.. and since its on my pc's screenshot folder will see it weekly...
---
I never cared for misfit. I hate the way it sounds and something about the sights or scope make visibility weird for me. The game is about using what weapons you love. When you follow the meta the game is boring. I hope you have a lot of fun with it.
---
Why, is it on there? They have lots of reddit bots, so my friend could have got it from there.
---
For what it’s worth, I just fast traveled to the point near the obelisk over and over. After about 6 or 7 times, it loaded me into a new instance with no players and it let me interact.
---
Lol, bad design? You're out of your fucking mind if you think that constitutes as bad design. Go play Anthem, then you'll know the true meaning of bad design
---
imagine having to equip an exotic make a subclass even remotely competent.
---
I have no problem with someone who wants to camp the portal, or a player who gets killed *once* by something stupid - shit happens. I’ve been smashed by the drill, gotten a hug from screebs and yeeted by a phalanx before. My go-to loadout allows me to deal with anything on my side, counter-invade and consistently do 50% Primeval damage or more (sniper, Recluse, Anarchy with golden gun or nova bomb). 
---
When there’s someone on my team that my drunk friends make look like a bot, it’s a bit of a problem and I just chalk the match up as a loss. I no longer give a rat’s ass about wins or losses.
---
Get better at the game
---
I kind of reminds me of Halo: Reach, Big Team Battle back in 2011. If you went in with a party of 8 you would squash randoms, but meeting another party of 8 meant a real battle.
---
Why? The final boss doesn't dodge at all other than the phase teleports, has the biggest and most stationary crit location in the game, and none of the trash is anything to write home about, even in nightfall, so long as you actually brought Overload and antibarrier rounds for the Ogres and Knights.
---
The titan in the thumbnail is amazing!! I can't wait for those Gauntlets to be for bright dust
---
But they were on the planet for a really long time and the drifter had been adventuring with them since before the guardians formed
---
Who did you turn on?
---
It's probably this: https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1207043945282191360?s=19
---
shadowkeep
---
Happy Dawning everyone
---
Why is this topic coming back up in 2019 lol.
---
Thinking that i would be nice to force ppl to raid. But most solo players or small clans are just put aside from prestige gear, except dungeon and nightfall.
---
Ok, thanks for the heads up.
---
Someone who knows of Red Dwarf.
---
A cat of culture I see
---
The quest line is very slightly different for each choice, adjusted for the role. He'll also address you as Snitch, and you lose out on some lore books if you side with Drifter
---
Maybe your burnt out or something man. Destiny is in one of the best states it's ever been in. 
---
There are some outliers in pvp but it's in a better spot than y1. No raid requires power leveling of the artifact.
---
 There is no weapons from pvp required for pve. Even when recluse was meta and auto loading was a thing recluse/MTN top were never required. 
---
The mod system is amazing and creates a more diverse build system then we have ever had. Affinity isn't the best but it's still being tweaked. This season came with more universal mods and more improvements will be coming.
---
 Yes the bugs have been rampant since the Activision split which I think was due to other studios doing a lot of leg work on bug/QA testing. 
---
Right now is a great time to get into the game.
---
I personally prefer the purple ones, but not for snacks... they fit really well in hive nostrils when they try to hit me.
---
Must be a connection problem.
---
Well seeing as I literally only had a few seconds to see him, the guy who sniped at the end.
---
A bug as in no one should be able to access the quest because its not suppose to be given out in season 9. 
---
https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48522
---
They also act well as a quick snack if you don’t have other colors available. Purple doesn’t taste as goodest as blue does
---
Two knives, and dodge to regain em both.
---
Requirements:  
---
\-You own Lion rampant exotic boots  
---
\-a sword  
---
\-catapult lift is selected as your jump  
---
\-You happen to be a Titan
---
After acquiring all of the above, you can start to practice.  
---
(I'd recommend trying to fly over hellmouth on the moon)  
---
So, how do you do this:  
---
Tap jump twice, so the catapult lift lifts you up some, wait a tiny bit, sword swing, wait a tiny bit, repeat.  
---
It is a lot about the timing, and it is not too hard to master. If you run out of sword ammo, go grab some from a public event flag, or if none are around and you are on the moon as I suggested, you can use  Phantasmal Fragments at the sanctuary to summon a rally banner.  
---
But with that being said, I'm not the best at explaining this, but I hope this helps.
---
#NUH-UH BLUE IS SUPERIOR GOODINESS IN FAVLOR
---
Anyone find a way to fix this yet?
---
Wow. The Hitboxes on a controllers are reaaally huge for that knife. Good job tho, guardian!
---
What?
---
So sad you cant comprehend a simple concept.
---
This isnt about the image. In fact I think it's hilarious. There are plenty of places to put that other than here. It does not belong here. We should have some semblance of decorum and standards of conduct in a public place. To do otherwise is degenerative. 
---
Just put this in it's proper place. It's simple.
---
I nearly came thinking you were gonna hit a collat.
---
Dude I feel like the drifter is really holding back with some crazy powers he hasn’t shown yet. He’s such a cool character.
---
Add the Monte Carlo on top of that, plus the Solar Plexus class item mod, and you've got yourself a fun time
---
Its the same people that call titans crayon eaters and think thats a grade A joke so I’d call that a win
---
Time to try my luck rerolling it again.
---
Its almost like the speed in super was the point of it being nerfed and its still the same glide otherwise.
---
Nobody wants SRL to return. A few people on reddit do. But 90% of the community would be confused as to why they wasted time implementing a racing mode into a looter shooter instead of actual content. I get that it sucks to be one of thr few people that enjoied it. But most of us just want to shoot things

No problem. 2 of the Crew did die to the Darkness beings on the Planet, so I get the confusion
---
I dont remember ever seeing this
---
I just think cayde was overhyped
---
Go play something else. You're an entitled crybaby.
---
Which is why i've quit playing on PC. Got tired of losing matches to hackers. Wasn't worth the slightly better game play.
---
With all of that boost to reload, you have no range or impact, no traits such as snapshot, quickdraw, rampage or kill clip, this gun roll is awful.
---
I count zero time you slided in that video.
---
A suggestion would to use a SMG because at that range you are outclassed by any 900rpm smg.
---
Did not get it from first armor drop. Will report back.
---
I did as well, but why something old instead of something NEW? Why regurgitate the same shit instead of coming up with actual new armors?
---
I dont think so...
---
3 one hit kill melee abilities is also cheating
---
I agree it is better, that doesn’t change the fact that it’s giving us d shit we already had. You guys want old stuff instead of new cool armor?
---
OoOoOOOoOOOh! Smiles on the field
---
Depends how long "a bit" is. Doesn't seem to have changed much from last season, although toss in Symmetry.
---
i wouldn't go that far. the hackers on came because of steam and they're quite rare but getting increasingly common in comparison (and apparently gambit but i've yet to see any there) 
---
an easy solution is just prevent china from playing with americans, europeans and other asians like on bnet where they had their own region and going in eu would make them lag to the point it was unplayable, also a good anti cheat
---
I thought AK was the midwest?
---
Georgia btw.
---
Buying DLC and expecting something new isn’t really entitled. You are the exact reason games are declining in quality, because developers can just regurgitate the same old shit and never have to come up with anything new
---
Why? That would hurt.
---
Cræyönß för äll
---
Season of Fighting Lion was more fun.
---
Git gud....lol
---
You haven’t been on destiny today have you
---
He actually did call it, but pretty late in the match.
---
Nope, new artifact, new mods. All the old mods are no longer there and we have to do with the new ones
---
Yep
---
Osiris is a little buggy, you have to open him up a few times to get the questd
---
Nah, there's bits in the NW of the state that more lean toward midwest in terms of speaking, but def south for most of the state lol. Even so, never heard it called that in Louisiana either. 
---
Also AK is Alaska, AR is Arkansas :)
---
we in the 'bungie tells you what to use' meta.
---
sucks big donkey dick
---
" There will be an Armor 2.0 version of the Iron Truage set available this season. The Seasonal Pursuit to earn this armor will work similar to last Season but we have changed some of the steps and what weapons are required to gain progress.  "

---
Tell me where it says new armor set
---
4 from Iron Banner quests
---
1 from Pit of Heresy
---
1 from Garden of Salvation
---
1 from master nightmare hunt
---
1 from nightfall the ordeal 100k score
---
I don't know where the others are.
---
Gotta be one hell of a chimney for him to fit, though
---
To be at your normal power rating for the next match. Whole point is to start match &gt; equip weak heavy weapon &gt; Use lower power rating to work on bounties &gt; Match Ends &gt; Switch to your normal heavy weapon....rinse repeat.
---
You made me nervous for a second ngl. :P
---
Didnt you ask the exact same fucking question around 20 Minuztes or something ago
---
One eyed mask?
---
Twilight garrison
---
You can get it without forsaken
---
Couldn’t you just keep the lower power heavy on? I just don’t see the point in switching.
---
What’s with the hostility?
---
If anything this quest should just be a regular crucible quest that you can do if you want to. It sucks all the fun out playing Iron Banner
---
No hostility intended. I just like to use fucking a lot.
---
Yup your GF definitely has talent
---
Huh. Well alrighty then.
---
Its done that way so you have a higher chance of being further up the list in each match for power rating. My warlock is roughly 972 and almost always at the top of the player list for power. When I switch to a 750 heavy weapon it drops my power to 947 well below most other players.
---
Its a very simple concept which I've explained three times now.
---
My favourite thing about the burning maul super is it melts crayons INSTANTLY so I can just drink ‘em off the floor!
---
Wish my controller looked that good
---
Then you're a titan, my dude
---
Nah, shits dumb. Any quest that encourages camping behavior in pvp is a bad design.
---
Sunbreaker is the only way I play titan. It feels way more balanced and fun then the other two.
---
I'm not reading your wall of text, but I agree. I want Saint's armor
---
Bruh how it finna take bungie 6 months to make a jacket smh
---
I don’t think you understand how this all works
---
I just got home and I’m getting ii y I would be
---
My man! Bringing the hammer down like everyone's a nail just waiting to get hammered. :D
---
Thank you for your validation. I legit haven't touched my warlock since forsaken.
---
I like gambit. Especially gambit prime
---
I agree with you my wizard friend
---
Ding ding ding
---
She does indeed
---
I play Titan. OEM is cheating.
---
We should be able to bake Regrettable Biscuits for Taeko-3.
---
That's pretty cool!
---
Lmao, cold. Love it.
---
Holiest*
---
So let me get this straight if you switch to a lower power after the game starts you retain the benefits of the power you were when the game started? Or am i still missing the point?
---
Bruh moment
---
How about two tail ?
---
Very nice
---
The cayde cutscene except its you on the ground
---
I do apologize for the insult, I've just seen so many heated debates over this that I instinctively went to the insult. And while, yes, they can do whatever they want, they aren't going to bring him back. It is a definite, no matter how much people beg for the return of Cayde. It would legitimately ruin Forsaken and every event past it
---
So i found out. As i told you im a hunter and the exotic i unlocked is for a titan so i cant claim it 😂
---
Nah, you should not have 3 one hit kill abilities.
---
😂😂
---
But this is just not true
---
All of which are the same ability minus some status effects that only affect pve
---
Go on your titan and then on inventory mods? 
---
You shouldnt get anything for other classes from drops or engrams, unless from xur.
---
Well done, take my upvote with pride, Guardian.
---
especially because she goes through them like a flash no matter the speed you're going through it.
---
at first she's like "we can't! its too dangerous!" only to literally go a millisecond later "wait i actually do have a plan" as if they were said in the same breath. theres no proper pause between the sentences to actually convey a sense of danger or urgency
---
I feel like at this point no matter what weapon type it is y’all will complain
---
I wonder if Josuke could have turned her back to normal
---
Exactly, but people are always going to want free shit.
---
I always wonder if those people would like it if people came to their job asking for free shit 🤷🏽‍♂️ 
---
For the amount of content we got this season for $10 it’s a fucking steal, so I’m happy to support the devs of my fav game with a few silver purchases.
---
Oh I meant the weekly bounty, not the challenge
---
I've got two of them. Complete PITA that Bungie appears to have no desire to fix.
---
Back in my day titans didnt use physical weapons. All they had was a bubble and their fists
---
'The corrupted' would like a word.....
---
He’s not wrong lol.
---
I love this super, especially the activation. Gets most people by surprise.
---
Nice graphics!
---
*Genocide*
---
I stopped playing because I couldn’t enter a single pregame lobby without being subjected to a bunch of chinese nonsense and autistic screeching
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but i think thats the ornament that comes with the deluxe edition of forsaken, don't know if it was sold in the eververse before though
---
Holy shit. It really does. I didn’t want to be the guy to point out the lack of recoil.
---
*right amount
---
They didn’t give them a warlock shell
---
*happy carnage, guardian*
---
Don’t worry I play with my clan now and we go easy if we are playing randoms and then go hard when we find people like u
---
Grow fat from gifts guardian.
---
This game is not for you kid take your salt and playing fortnite or something. Everyone here is trying to help you learn which stats are better but your 2 brain cells cant process it.
---
There is a reason I only mentioned long range. And why I just don’t use Malfeasance. :D
---
But did you get a 7th column tho...
---
Sounds like a good way to kill crucible and gambit in a free to play game.
---
Pretty sure all of the supers could constitute as needing no skill, it’s a super. Either way, the fact that I popped it with such low health could have easily gotten me wiped if I made a poor decision.
---
I just keep going back and forth between orbiting and the EDZ land zone.
---
Isn't there lore that Shaxx secretly watches Gambit matches, at first to monitor them but ended up enjoying and getting into them?
---
It’s probably the one you got from the saint 14 mission. You aren’t allowed to masterwork that one for some reason
---
Been playing for months. If you need a macro to do a 180 turn then you’re not using the right sensitivity. I also have a pretty big mousepad and am able to make long swipes.
---
Gambit sucks
---
He comes Friday and leaves at reset
---
PC
---
And wont be back till friday 12pm est. That's how it works.
---
Xur disappears from Tuesday’s reset to Friday’s reset. Once Friday rolls around, he’ll be in a new spot with new gear.
---
Eris is the creepy, silent but still smart kid that knows a bit too much.
